Suddenly, one of the trio remarked: “I have been\r\nreading an old magazine article which describes a fossil-collecting\r\nexpedition in the West; why can’t we get up something of the kind?” The\r\nothers replied, as with one voice, “We can; let’s do it.” This seemingly\r\nidle talk was, for Osborn and myself, a momentous one, for it completely\r\nchanged the careers which, as we then believed, had been mapped out for\r\nus. The random suggestion led directly to the first of the Princeton\r\npalæontological expeditions, that of 1877, which took us to the “Bad\r\nLands” of the Bridger region in southwestern Wyoming. The fascination of\r\ndiscovering and exhuming with our own hands the remains of the curious\r\ncreatures which once inhabited North America, but became extinct ages\r\nago, has proved an enduring delight. It was the wish to extend something\r\nof this fascinating interest to a wider circle, that occasioned the\r\npreparation of this book.\r\n\r\nThe western portion of North America has preserved a marvellous series\r\nof records of the successive assemblages of animals which once dwelt\r\nin this continent, and in southernmost South America an almost equally\r\ncomplete record was made of the strange animals of that region. For\r\nthe last half-century, or more, many workers have coöperated to bring\r\nthis long-vanished world to light and to decipher and interpret the\r\nwonderful story of mammalian development in the western hemisphere. The\r\ntask of making this history intelligible, not to say interesting, to the\r\nlayman, has been one of formidable difficulty, for it is recorded in\r\nthe successive modifications of the bones and teeth, and without some\r\nknowledge of osteology, these records are in an unknown tongue. To meet\r\nthis need, Chapter III gives a sketch of the mammalian skeleton and\r\ndentition, which the reader may use as the schoolboy uses a vocabulary\r\nto translate his Latin exercise, referring to it from time to time, as\r\nmay be necessary to make clear the descriptions of the various mammalian\r\ngroups. Technical terms have been avoided as far as possible, but,\r\nunfortunately, it is not practicable to dispense with them altogether.\r\nThe appended glossary will, it is hoped, minimize the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not examined it, can form any conception of the enormous\r\nmass and variety of material, illustrating the history of American\r\nmammals, which has already been gathered into the various museums. A full\r\naccount of this material would require many volumes, and one of the chief\r\nproblems in the preparation of this book has been that of making a proper\r\nselection of the most instructive and illuminating portions of the long\r\nand complicated story. Indeed, so rapid is the uninterrupted course of\r\ndiscovery, that parts of the text became antiquated while in the press\r\nand had to be rewritten. As first prepared, the work proved to be far\r\ntoo long and it was necessary to excise several chapters, for it seemed\r\nbetter to cover less ground than to make the entire history hurried and\r\nsuperficial. The plan of treatment adopted involves a considerable amount\r\nof repetition, but this is perhaps not a disadvantage, since the same\r\nfacts are considered from different points of view.\r\n\r\nThe facts which are here brought together have been ascertained by\r\nmany workers, and I have borrowed with the greatest freedom from my\r\nfellow labourers in the field of palæontology. As every compiler of a\r\nmanual finds, it is not feasible to attribute the proper credit to each\r\ndiscoverer. Huxley has so well explained the situation in the preface to\r\nhis “Anatomy of Vertebrated Animals,” that I may be permitted to borrow\r\nhis words: “I have intentionally refrained from burdening the text with\r\nreferences; and, therefore, the reader, while he is justly entitled to\r\nhold me responsible for any errors he may detect, will do well to give me\r\nno credit for what may seem original, unless his knowledge is sufficient\r\nto render him a competent judge on that head.”\r\n\r\nA book of this character is obviously not the proper place for polemical\r\ndiscussions of disputed questions. Whenever, therefore, the views\r\nexpressed differ widely from those maintained by other palæontologists,\r\nI have attempted no more than to state, as fairly as I could, the\r\nalternative interpretations and my own choice between them. Any other\r\ncourse was forbidden by the limitations of space.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to give expression to my sincere sense of gratitude\r\nto the many friends who have helped me in an unusually laborious\r\nundertaking. Professor Osborn and Dr. Matthew have placed at my disposal\r\nthe wonderful treasures of the American Museum of Natural History in New\r\nYork and in the most liberal manner have supplied me with photographs and\r\nspecimens for drawings, as well as with information regarding important\r\ndiscoveries which have not yet been published. Dr. W. J. Holland,\r\nDirector of the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh, has likewise generously\r\nprovided many photographs from the noble collection under his charge,\r\nkindly permitting the use of material still undescribed. To Professor\r\nCharles Schuchert, of Yale University, I am also indebted for several\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nThe figures of existing animals are almost all from photographs taken\r\nin the New York and London zoölogical gardens, and I desire to thank\r\nDirector Hornaday, of the Bronx Park, and Mr. Peacock, of the London\r\ngarden, for the very kind manner in which they have procured these\r\nillustrations for my use. The photographs have been modified by painting\r\nout the backgrounds of cages, houses, and the like, so as to give a less\r\nartificial appearance to the surroundings.\r\n\r\nTo my colleagues at Princeton I am under great obligations for much\r\nvaluable counsel and assistance. Professor Gilbert van Ingen has prepared\r\nthe maps and diagrams and Dr. W. J. Sinclair has devoted much labour\r\nand care to the illustrations and has also read the proofs. Both of\r\nthese friends, as also Professors C. H. Smyth and E. G. Conklin and Drs.\r\nFarr and McComas, have read various parts of the manuscript and made\r\nmany helpful suggestions in dealing with the problems of treatment and\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nFor thirteen years past I have been engaged in the study of the great\r\ncollections of fossil mammals, gathered in Patagonia by the lamented Mr.\r\nHatcher and his colleague, Mr. Peterson, now of the Carnegie Museum.\r\nThis work made it necessary for me to visit the museums of the Argentine\r\nRepublic, which I did in 1901, and was there received with the greatest\r\ncourtesy and kindness by Dr. F. Moreno, Director, and Dr. Santiago Roth,\r\nof the La Plata Museum, and Dr. F. Ameghino, subsequently Director of the\r\nNational Museum at Buenos Aires. To all of these gentlemen the chapters\r\non the ancient life of South America are much indebted, especially to\r\nDr. Ameghino, whose untimely death was a great loss to science. It is\r\nearnestly to be hoped that the heroic story of his scientific career may\r\nsoon be given to the world.\r\n\r\nFinally, I desire to thank Mr. Horsfall for the infinite pains and care\r\nwhich he has expended upon the illustrations for the work, to which so\r\nvery large a part of its value is due.\r\n\r\nWhile the book is primarily intended for the lay reader, I cannot but\r\nhope that it may also be of service to many zoölogists, who have been\r\nunable to keep abreast of the flood of palæontological discovery and yet\r\nwish to learn something of its more significant results. How far I have\r\nsucceeded in a most difficult task must be left to the judgment of such\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n    PRINCETON, N.J., June 1, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  METHODS OF INVESTIGATION—GEOLOGICAL                                    1\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  METHODS OF INVESTIGATION—PALÆONTOLOGICAL                              29\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE MAMMALIA                                    50\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  THE SKELETON AND TEETH OF MAMMALS                                     61\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  THE GEOGRAPHICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAS IN CENOZOIC TIMES        99\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MAMMALS                             135\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  THE SUCCESSIVE MAMMALIAN FAUNAS OF NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA           192\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE PERISSODACTYLA                                        288\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE ARTIODACTYLA                                          358\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE PROBOSCIDEA                                           422\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE †AMBLYPODA AND †CONDYLARTHRA                          443\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE †TOXODONTIA (OR †NOTOUNGULATA)                        461\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE †LITOPTERNA AND †ASTRAPOTHERIA                        489\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE CARNIVORA                                             516\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES                                              577\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE EDENTATA                                              589\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE MARSUPIALIA                                           624\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n  MODES OF MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION                                         645\r\n\r\n  GLOSSARY                                                             665\r\n\r\n  INDEX                                                                675\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HISTORY OF LAND MAMMALS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF INVESTIGATION—GEOLOGICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term _Mammal_ has no exact equivalent in the true vernacular of\r\nany modern language, the word itself, like its equivalents, the French\r\n_Mammifère_ and the German _Säugethier_, being entirely artificial. As\r\na name for the class Linnæus adopted the term Mammalia, which he formed\r\nfrom the Latin _mamma_ (_i.e._ teat) to designate those animals which\r\nsuckle their young; hence the abbreviated form Mammal, which has been\r\nnaturalized as an English word. “Beast,” as employed in the Bible, and\r\n“Quadruped” are not quite the same as mammal, for they do not include the\r\nmarine forms, such as whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, or the flying\r\nbats, and they are habitually used in contradistinction to Man, though\r\nMan and all the forms mentioned are unquestionably mammals.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to frame a definition of the term _Mammal_, it is\r\nimpossible to avoid technicalities altogether, for it is the complete\r\nunity of plan and structure which justifies the inclusion of all the\r\nmany forms that differ so widely in habits and appearance. _Mammals are\r\nair-breathing vertebrates, which are warm-blooded and have a 4-chambered\r\nheart; the body cavity is divided into pleural and abdominal chambers\r\nby a diaphragm; except in the lowest division of the class, the young\r\nare brought forth alive and are always suckled, the milk glands being\r\nuniversal throughout the class. In the great majority of mammals the\r\nbody is clothed with hair; a character found in no other animals. In\r\na few mammals the skin is naked, and in still fewer there is a partial\r\ncovering of scales._ The list of characters common to all mammals, which\r\ndistinguish them from other animals, might be indefinitely extended,\r\nfor it includes all the organs and tissues of the body, the skeletal,\r\nmuscular, digestive, nervous, circulatory, and reproductive systems, but\r\nthe two or three more obvious or significant features above selected will\r\nsuffice for the purposes of definition.\r\n\r\nWhile the structural plan is the same throughout the entire class,\r\nthere is among mammals a wonderful variety of form, size, appearance,\r\nand adaptation to special habits. It is as though a musician had taken\r\na single theme and developed it into endless variations, preserving\r\nan unmistakable unity through all the changes. Most mammals are\r\n_terrestrial_, living, that is to say, not only on the land, but on the\r\nground, and are herbivorous in habit, subsisting chiefly or exclusively\r\nupon vegetable substances, but there are many departures from this mode\r\nof life. It should be explained, however, that the term _terrestrial_ is\r\nfrequently used in a more comprehensive sense for all land mammals, as\r\ndistinguished from those that are aquatic or marine. Monkeys, Squirrels,\r\nSloths and Opossums are examples of the numerous _arboreal_ mammals,\r\nwhose structure is modified to fit them for living and sleeping in the\r\ntrees, and in some, such as the Sloths, the modification is carried so\r\nfar that the creature is almost helpless on the ground. Another mode of\r\nexistence is the burrowing or _fossorial_, the animal living partly or\r\nmostly, or even entirely underground, a typical instance of which is the\r\nMole. The Beaver, Muskrat and Otter, to mention only a few forms, are\r\n_aquatic_ and spend most of their life in fresh waters, though perfectly\r\nable to move about on the land. _Marine_ mammals, such as the Seals and\r\nWhales, have a greatly modified structure which adapts them to life in\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of each of these categories we may note that there\r\nare many degrees of specialization or adaptation to particular modes of\r\nlife. Thus, for example, among the marine mammals, the Whales and their\r\nallies, Porpoises, etc., are so completely adapted to a life in the\r\nseas that they cannot come upon the land, and even stranding is fatal\r\nto them, while the Seals frequently land and move about upon the shore.\r\nIt should further be observed that mammals of the most diverse groups\r\nare adapted to similar modes of existence. Thus in one natural group or\r\n_order_ of related forms, occur terrestrial, burrowing, arboreal and\r\naquatic members, and the converse statement is of course equally true,\r\nthat animals of similar life-habits are not necessarily related to one\r\nanother, and very frequently, in fact, are not so related. Among the\r\ntypically marine mammals, for example, there are at least three and\r\nprobably four distinct series, which have independently become adapted to\r\nlife in the sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to set forth an outline of what has been learned\r\nregarding the history of mammalian life in the western hemisphere, it\r\nis essential to give the reader some conception of the manner in which\r\nthat knowledge has been obtained. Without such an understanding of the\r\nmethods employed in the investigation the reader can only blindly accept\r\nor as blindly reject what purports to be the logical inference from\r\nwell-established evidence. How is that evidence to be discovered? and how\r\nmay trustworthy conclusions be derived from it?\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious step is to gather all possible information\r\nconcerning the mammals of the present day, their structure (comparative\r\nanatomy), functions (physiology), and their geographical arrangement.\r\nThis latter domain, of the geographical distribution of mammals, is one\r\nof peculiar significance. Not only do the animals of North America differ\r\nradically from those of Central and South America, but within the limits\r\nof each continent are more or less well-defined areas, the animals of\r\nwhich differ in a subordinate degree from those of other areas. The study\r\nof the modern world, however, would not of itself carry us very far\r\ntoward the goal of our inquiries, which is an _explanation_, not merely\r\na statement, of the facts. The present order of things is the outcome\r\nof an illimitably long sequence of events and can be understood only in\r\nproportion to our knowledge of the past. In other words, it is necessary\r\nto treat the problems involved in our inquiry _historically_; to trace\r\nthe evolution of the different mammalian groups from their simpler\r\nbeginnings to the more complex and highly specialized modern forms; to\r\ndetermine, so far as that may be done, the place of origin of each group\r\nand to follow out their migrations from continent to continent.\r\n\r\nWhile we shall deal chiefly, almost exclusively, with the mammals of the\r\nNew World, something must be said regarding those of other continents,\r\nfor, as will be shown in the sequel, both North and South America have,\r\nat one time or another, been connected with various land-masses of the\r\neastern hemisphere. By means of those land-connections, there has been\r\nan interchange of mammals between the different continents, and each\r\ngreat land-area of the recent world contains a more or less heterogeneous\r\nassemblage of forms of very diverse places of origin. Indeed, migration\r\nfrom one region to another has played a most important part in bringing\r\nabout the present distribution of living things. From what has already\r\nbeen learned as to the past life of the various continents and their\r\nshifting connections with one another, it is now feasible to analyze the\r\nmammalian faunas of most of them and to separate the indigenous from the\r\nimmigrant elements. Among the latter may be distinguished those forms\r\nwhich are the much modified descendants of ancient migrants from those\r\nwhich arrived at a much later date and have undergone but little change.\r\nTo take a few examples from North America, it may be said that the Bears,\r\nMoose, Caribou and Bison are late migrants from the Old World; that the\r\nVirginia and Black-tailed Deer and the Prong-horned Antelope are of\r\nOld World origin, but their ancestors came in at a far earlier period\r\nand the modern species are greatly changed from the ancestral migrants.\r\nThe Armadillo of Texas and the Canada Porcupine are almost the only\r\nsurvivors, north of Mexico, of the great migration of South American\r\nmammals which once invaded the northern continent. On the other hand,\r\nthe raccoons and several families of rodents are instances of indigenous\r\ntypes which may be traced through a long American ancestry.\r\n\r\nFully to comprehend the march of mammalian development, it thus becomes\r\nnecessary to reconstruct, at least in outline, the geography of the\r\nsuccessive epochs through which the developmental changes have taken\r\nplace, the connections and separations of land-masses, the rise of\r\nmountain ranges, river and lake systems and the like. Equally significant\r\nfactors in the problem are climatic changes, which have had a profound\r\nand far-reaching effect upon the evolution and geographical spread of\r\nanimals and plants, and the changes in the vegetable world must not be\r\nignored, for, directly or indirectly, animals are dependent upon plants.\r\nTo one who has paid no attention to questions of this kind, it might well\r\nseem an utterly hopeless task to reconstruct the long vanished past, and\r\nhe would naturally conclude that, at best, only fanciful speculations,\r\nwith no foundation of real knowledge, could be within our reach. Happily,\r\nsuch is by no means the case. Geology offers the means of a successful\r\nattack upon these problems and, although very much remains to be done,\r\nmuch has already been accomplished in elucidating the history, especially\r\nin its later periods, with which the story of the mammals is more\r\nparticularly concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly impossible to present here a treatise upon the science\r\nof Geology, even in outline sketch. Considerations of space are\r\nsufficient to forbid any such attempt. Certain things must be taken for\r\ngranted, the evidence for which may be found in any modern text-book of\r\nGeology. For example, it is entirely feasible to establish the mode of\r\nformation of almost any rock (aside from certain problematical rocks,\r\nwhich do not enter into our discussion) and to determine whether it\r\nwas laid down in the sea, or on the land, or in some body of water not\r\ndirectly connected with the sea, such as a lake or river. With the aid\r\nof the microscope, it is easy to discriminate volcanic material from\r\nthe ordinary water-borne and wind-borne sediments and, in the case of\r\nthe rocks which have solidified from the molten state, to distinguish\r\nthose masses which have cooled upon the surface from those which have\r\nsolidified deep within the earth.\r\n\r\nWhile the nature and mode of formation of the rocks may thus be\r\npostulated, it will be needful to explain at some length the character of\r\nthe evidence from which the history of the earth may be deciphered. First\r\nof all, must be made clear the method by which the events of the earth’s\r\nhistory may be arranged in chronological order, for a history without\r\nchronology is unintelligible. The events which are most significant for\r\nour purpose are recorded in the rocks which are called _stratified,\r\nbedded or sedimentary_, synonymous terms. Such rocks were made mostly\r\nfrom the débris of older rocks, in the form of gravel, sand or mud, and\r\nwere laid down under water, or, less extensively, spread by the action of\r\nthe wind upon a land-surface. Important members of this group of rocks\r\nare those formed, more or less completely, from the finer fragments given\r\nout in volcanic eruptions, carried and sorted by the wind and finally\r\ndeposited, it may be at great distances from their point of origin,\r\nupon a land-surface, or on the bottom of some body of water. Stratified\r\nor bedded rocks, as their name implies, are divided into more or less\r\nparallel layers or beds, which may be many feet or only a minute fraction\r\nof an inch in thickness. Such a division means a pause in the process of\r\ndeposition or a change in the character of the material deposited over\r\na given area. Owing to the operation of gravity, the layers of sediment\r\nare spread out in a horizontal attitude, which disregard the minor\r\nirregularities of the bottom, just as a deep snow buries the objects\r\nwhich lie upon the surface.\r\n\r\nA moment’s consideration will show that, in any series of stratified\r\nrocks which have not been greatly disturbed from their original\r\nhorizontal position, _the order of succession or superposition of the\r\nbeds must necessarily be the chronological order of their formation_.\r\n(Fig. 1.) Obviously, the lowest beds must have been deposited first and\r\ntherefore are the oldest of the series, while those at the top must\r\nbe the newest or youngest and the beds intermediate in position are\r\nintermediate in age. This inference depends upon the simple principle\r\nthat each bed must have been laid down before the next succeeding\r\none can have been deposited upon it. While this is so clear as to be\r\nalmost self-evident, it is plain that such a mode of determining the\r\nchronological order of the rocks of the earth’s crust can be of only\r\nlocal applicability and so far as the beds may be traced in unbroken\r\ncontinuity. It is of no direct assistance in correlating the events in\r\nthe history of one continent with those of another and it fails even in\r\ncomparing the distinctly separated parts of the same continent. Some\r\nmethod of universal applicability must be devised before the histories of\r\nscattered regions can be combined to form a history of the earth. Such a\r\nuniversal method is to be found in the _succession of the forms of life_,\r\nso far as that is recorded in the shape of _fossils_, or the recognizable\r\nremains of animal and vegetable organisms preserved in the rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Diagram section of a series of beds, illustrating\r\nsuperposition. A is the oldest, B, C, D, etc., succeeding in ascending\r\norder.]\r\n\r\nThis principle was first enunciated by William Smith, an English\r\nengineer, near the close of the eighteenth century, who thus laid the\r\nfoundations of Historical Geology. In the diagram, Fig. 2, is reproduced\r\nSmith’s section across England from Wales to near London, which shows\r\nthe successive strata or beds, very much tilted from their original\r\nhorizontal position by the upheaval of the sea-bed upon which they\r\nwere laid down. The section pictures the side of an imaginary gigantic\r\ntrench cut across the island and was constructed by a simple geometrical\r\nmethod from the surface exposures of the beds, such as mining engineers\r\ncontinually employ to map the underground extension of economically\r\nimportant rocks, and shows how an enormous thickness of strata may be\r\nstudied from the surface. The older beds are exposed at the western end\r\nof the section in Wales and, passing eastward, successively later and\r\nlater beds are encountered, the newest appearing at the eastern end. Very\r\nmany of the strata are richly fossiliferous, and thus a long succession\r\nof fossils was obtained in the _order of their appearance_, and this\r\norder has been found to hold good, not only in England, but throughout\r\nthe world. The order of succession of the fossils was thus in the first\r\ninstance actually ascertained from the succession of the strata in which\r\nthey are found and has been verified in innumerable sections in many\r\nlands and is thus a matter of observed and verifiable fact, not merely\r\na postulate or working hypothesis. Once ascertained, however, the order\r\nof succession of living things upon the earth may be then employed as an\r\nindependent and indispensable means of geologically dating the rocks in\r\nwhich they occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—William Smith’s section across the south of\r\nEngland. The vertical scale is exaggerated, which makes the inclination\r\nof the beds appear too steep.\r\n\r\nN. B. The original drawing is in colors, which are not indicated by the\r\ndotted strata.]\r\n\r\nThis is the _palæontological method_, which finds analogies in many\r\nother branches of learned inquiry. The student of manuscripts discovers\r\nthat there is a development, or regular series of successive changes,\r\nin handwriting, and from the handwriting alone can make a very close\r\napproximation to the date of a manuscript. The order in which those\r\nchanges came about was ascertained from the comparative study of\r\nmanuscripts, the date of which could be ascertained from other evidence,\r\nbut, when once established, the changes in handwriting are used to fix\r\nthe period of undated manuscripts. Just so, the succession of fossils,\r\nwhen learned from a series of superposed beds, may then be employed to\r\nfix the geological date of strata in another region. Similarly, the\r\narchæologist has observed that there is an evolution or development in\r\nevery sort of the work of men’s hands and therefore makes use of coins,\r\ninscriptions, objects of art, building materials and methods, etc., to\r\ndate ancient structures. In the German town of Trier (or Trèves) on the\r\nMoselle, the cathedral has as a nucleus a Roman structure, the date and\r\npurpose of which had long been matters of dispute, though the general\r\nbelief was that the building had been erected under Constantine the\r\nGreat. In the course of some repairs made not very long ago, it became\r\nnecessary to cut deep into the Roman brickwork, and there, embedded\r\nin the undisturbed mortar, was a coin of the emperor Valentinian II,\r\nevidently dropped from the pocket of some Roman bricklayer. That coin\r\nfixed a date older than which the building cannot be, though it may be\r\nslightly later, and it well illustrates the service rendered by fossils\r\nin determining geological chronology.\r\n\r\nOther methods of making out the chronology of the earth’s history have\r\nbeen proposed from time to time and all of them have their value, though\r\nnone of them renders us independent of the use of fossils, which have the\r\npre-eminent advantage of not recurring or repeating themselves at widely\r\nseparated intervals of time, as all physical processes and changes do. An\r\norganism, animal or plant, that has become extinct never returns and is\r\nnot reproduced in the evolutionary process.\r\n\r\nGreat and well founded as is our confidence in fossils as fixing the\r\ngeological date of the rocks in which they occur, it must not be\r\nforgotten that the succession of the different kinds of fossils in\r\ntime was first determined from the superposition of the containing\r\nstrata. Hence, it is always a welcome confirmation of the chronological\r\ninferences drawn from the study of fossils, when those inferences can\r\nbe unequivocally established by the succession of the beds themselves.\r\nFor example, in the Tertiary deposits of the West are two formations or\r\ngroups of strata, called respectively the Uinta and the White River,\r\nwhich had never been known to occur in the same region and whose relative\r\nage therefore could not be determined by the method of superposition.\r\nEach of the formations, however, has yielded a large number of\r\nwell-preserved fossil mammals, and the comparative study of these mammals\r\nmade it clear that the Uinta must be older than the White River and that\r\nno very great lapse of time, geologically speaking, occurred between the\r\nend of the former and the beginning of the latter. Only two or three\r\nyears ago an expedition from the American Museum of Natural History\r\ndiscovered a place in Wyoming where the White River beds lie directly\r\nupon those of the Uinta, thus fully confirming the inference as to the\r\nrelative age of these two formations which had long ago been drawn from\r\nthe comparative study of their fossil mammals.\r\n\r\nThe palæontological method of determining the geological date of the\r\nstratified rocks is thus an indispensable means of correlating the\r\nscattered exposures of the strata in widely separated regions and in\r\ndifferent continents, it may be with thousands of miles of intervening\r\nocean. The general principle employed is that _close similarity of\r\nfossils in the rocks of the regions compared points to an approximately\r\ncontemporaneous date of formation of those rocks_. This principle must\r\nnot, however, be applied in an off-hand or uncritical manner, or it will\r\nlead to serious error. In the first place, the evolutionary process is a\r\nvery slow one and geological time is inconceivably long, so that deposits\r\nwhich differ by some thousands of years may yet have the same or nearly\r\nthe same fossils. The method is not one of sufficient refinement to\r\ndetect such relatively small differences. To recur to the illustration\r\nof the development in handwriting, the palæographer can hardly do more\r\nthan determine the decade in which a manuscript was written; no one would\r\nexpect him to fix upon the exact year, still less the month, from the\r\nstudy of handwriting alone. As is the month in recorded human history, so\r\nis the millennium in the long course of the earth’s development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—Bluff on Beaver Creek, Fremont Co., Wyoming. The\r\nWhite River beds were deposited on the worn and weathered surface of\r\nthe Uinta, the heavy, broken line marking the separation between them.\r\nThe valley was carved out long after the deposition of the White River\r\nstrata.]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there are great differences in the contemporary life\r\nof separate regions and such geographical differences there have always\r\nbeen, so far as we can trace back the history of animals and plants. A\r\nnew organism does not originate simultaneously all over the world but,\r\nnormally at least, in a single area and spreads from that centre until\r\nit encounters insuperable obstacles. Such spreading is a slow process\r\nand hence it is that new forms often appear in one region much earlier\r\nthan in others and in the very process of extending their range, the\r\nadvancing species may themselves be considerably modified and reach their\r\nnew and distant homes as different species from those which originated\r\nthe movement. Extinction, likewise, seldom occurs simultaneously over\r\nthe range of a group, but now here and now there in a way that to our\r\nignorance appears to be arbitrary and capricious. The process may go on\r\nuntil extinction is total, or may merely result in a great restriction of\r\nthe range of a given group, or may break up that range into two or more\r\ndistinct areas.\r\n\r\nOf such incomplete extinctions many instances might be given, but one\r\nmust suffice. The camel-tribe, strange as it may appear, originated in\r\nNorth America and was long confined to that continent, while at the\r\npresent day it is represented only by the llamas of South America and\r\nthe true camels of Asia, having completely vanished from its early home.\r\nThese facts and a host of similar ones make plain how necessary it is to\r\ntake geographical considerations into account in all problems that deal\r\nwith the synchronizing of the rocks of separate areas and continents.\r\n\r\nProperly to estimate the significance of a difference in the fossils\r\nof two regions and to determine how far it is geographical, due to a\r\nseparation in space, or geological and caused by separation in time, is\r\noften a very difficult matter and requires a vast amount of minute and\r\ndetailed study. Once more, the principle involved is illustrated by the\r\nstudy of manuscripts. Down to the time when the printing press superseded\r\nthe copyist, each of the nations of Europe had its own traditions and\r\nits more or less independent course of handwriting development. A great\r\nmonastery, in which the work of copying manuscripts went on century after\r\ncentury, became an independent geographical centre with its particular\r\nstyles. Thus the palæographer, like the geologist, is confronted by\r\ngeographical problems as well as by those of change and development in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the method of geologically dating the rocks by means of\r\nthe fossils which they contain, there are other ways which may give a\r\ngreater precision to the result. Climatic changes, when demonstrable,\r\nare of this character, for they may speedily and simultaneously affect\r\nvast areas of the earth’s surface or even the entire world. From time to\r\ntime in the past, glacial conditions have prevailed over immense regions,\r\nseveral continents at once, it may be, as in one instance in which India,\r\nSouth Africa, Australia, South America were involved. The characteristic\r\naccumulations made by the glaciers in these widely separated regions\r\nmust be contemporaneous in a sense that can rarely be predicated of the\r\nordinary stratified rocks. Such climatic changes as the formation and\r\ndisappearance of the ice-fields give a sharper and more definite standard\r\nof time comparisons than do the fossils alone, and yet the fossils are\r\nin turn needed to show which of several possible glacial periods are\r\nactually being compared.\r\n\r\nAgain, great movements of the earth’s crust, which involve vast and\r\nwidely separated regions and bring the sea in over great areas of land,\r\nor raise great areas into land, which had been submerged, may also yield\r\nmore precise time-measurements, because occurring within shorter periods\r\nthan do notable changes in the system of living things. Such changes in\r\nanimals and plants may be compared to the almost imperceptible movement\r\nof the hour-hand of a clock, while the recorded climatic revolutions\r\nand crustal movements often supply the place of the minute-hand. It is\r\nobvious, however, that if the hour-hand be wanting, the minute-hand\r\nalone can be of very limited use. There have been a great many vast\r\nsubmergences and emergences of land in the history of the earth, and only\r\nthe fossils can give us the assurance that we are comparing the same\r\nmovement in distant continents, and not two similar movements separated\r\nby an enormous interval of time.\r\n\r\nIt may thus fairly be admitted that it is possible to arrange the rocks\r\nwhich compose the accessible parts of the earth’s crust in chronological\r\norder and to correlate in one system the rocks of the various continents.\r\nThe terms used for the more important divisions of geological time are,\r\nin descending order of magnitude, era, period, epoch, age or stage, and\r\nthe general scheme of the eras and periods, which is in almost uniform\r\nuse throughout the world, is given in the table, which is arranged so as\r\nto give the succession graphically, with the most ancient rocks at the\r\nbottom and the latest at the top.\r\n\r\n  Cenozoic era      { Quaternary period\r\n                    { Tertiary period\r\n\r\n                    { Cretaceous period\r\n  Mesozoic era      { Jurassic period\r\n                    { Triassic period\r\n\r\n                    { Permian period\r\n                    { Carboniferous period\r\n  Palæozoic era     { Devonian period\r\n                    { Silurian period\r\n                    { Ordovician period\r\n                    { Cambrian period\r\n\r\n  Pre-Cambrian eras { Algonkian period\r\n                    { Archæan period\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that all the divisions of similar rank, such as\r\nthe eras, for example, were of equal length, as measured by the thickness\r\nof the rocks assigned to those divisions. On the contrary, they must\r\nhave been of very unequal length and are of very different divisibility.\r\nThe Pre-Cambrian eras, with only two periods, were probably far longer\r\nthan all subsequent time, and all that the major divisions imply is that\r\nthey represent changes in the system of life of approximately equivalent\r\nimportance. It is impossible to give any trustworthy estimate of the\r\nactual lengths of these divisions in years, though many attempts to do so\r\nhave been made. All that can be confidently affirmed is that geological\r\ntime, like astronomical distances, is of inconceivable vastness and its\r\nyears can be counted only in hundreds of millions.\r\n\r\nTo discuss in any intelligible manner the history of mammals, it will be\r\nnecessary to go much farther than the above table in the subdivision of\r\nthat part of geological time in which mammalian evolution ran its course.\r\nAs mammals represent the highest stage of development yet attained in the\r\nanimal world, it is only the latter part of the earth’s history which\r\nis concerned with them; the earlier and incomparably longer portion of\r\nthat history may be passed over. Mammals are first recorded in the later\r\nTriassic, the first of the three periods which make up the Mesozoic era.\r\nThey have also been found, though very scantily, in the other Mesozoic\r\nperiods, the Jurassic and Cretaceous, but it was the Cenozoic era that\r\nwitnessed most of the amazing course of mammalian development and\r\ndiversification, and hence the relatively minute subdivisions necessary\r\nfor the understanding of this history deal only with the Cenozoic, the\r\nlatest of the great eras.\r\n\r\nIn the subjoined table the periods and epochs are those which are in\r\ngeneral use throughout the world, the ages and stages are those which\r\napply to the western interior of North America, each region, even of the\r\nsame continent, requiring a different classification. The South American\r\nformations are given in a separate table, as it is desirable to avoid the\r\nappearance of an exactitude in correlation which cannot yet be attained.\r\n\r\n                           CENOZOIC ERA\r\n\r\n  Quaternary period { Recent epoch\r\n                    { Pleistocene epoch = Glacial and Interglacial stages.\r\n\r\n                    { Pliocene epoch\r\n                    { Miocene epoch\r\n  Tertiary period   { Oligocene epoch\r\n                    { Eocene epoch\r\n                    { Paleocene epoch\r\n\r\nContinuing the subdivision of the Tertiary period still farther, we have\r\nthe following arrangement:\r\n\r\n                  TERTIARY PERIOD (North America)\r\n\r\n              { Upper    Wanting\r\n              { Middle   Blanco age\r\n  _Pliocene_  {        { Thousand Creek age\r\n              { Lower  { Snake Creek age\r\n              {        { Republican River age\r\n\r\n              { Upper    Loup Fork age\r\n  _Miocene_   { Middle   Deep River age\r\n              { Lower    Arikaree age\r\n\r\n  _Oligocene_ { Upper    John Day age\r\n              { Lower    White River age\r\n\r\n              { Upper    Uinta age\r\n  _Eocene_    { Middle   Bridger age\r\n              { Lower  { Wind River age\r\n                       { Wasatch age\r\n\r\n  _Paleocene_ { Upper    Torrejon age } Fort Union\r\n              { Lower    Puerco age   }\r\n\r\nThis is a representative series of the widespread and manifold non-marine\r\nTertiary deposits of the Great Plains, but a much more extensive and\r\nsubdivided scheme would be needed to show with any degree of fullness\r\nthe wonderfully complete record of that portion of the continent during\r\nthe Tertiary period. A much more elaborate table will be found in\r\nProfessor Osborn’s “Age of Mammals,” p. 41. There are some differences\r\nof practice among geologists as to this scheme of classification, though\r\nthe differences are not those of principle. No question arises concerning\r\nthe reality of the divisions, or their order of succession in time, but\r\nmerely as to the rank or relative importance which should be attributed\r\nto some of them, and that is a very minor consideration.\r\n\r\nMuch greater difficulty and, consequently, much more radical differences\r\nof interpretation arise when the attempt is made to correlate or\r\nsynchronize the smaller subdivisions, as found in the various continents,\r\nwith one another, because of the geographical differences in contemporary\r\nlife. Between Europe and North America there has always been a certain\r\nproportion of mammalian forms in common, a proportion that was at\r\none time greater, at another less, and this community renders the\r\ncorrelation of the larger divisions of the Tertiary in the two continents\r\ncomparatively easy, and even in the minor subdivisions very satisfactory\r\nprogress has been made, so that it is possible to trace in some detail\r\nthe migrations of mammals from the eastern to the western hemisphere and\r\n_vice versa_. Such intermigrations were made possible by the land-bridges\r\nconnecting America with Europe across the Atlantic, perhaps on the line\r\nof Greenland and Iceland, and with Asia where now is Bering Strait.\r\nThese connections were repeatedly made and repeatedly broken during the\r\nMesozoic and Cenozoic eras down to the latest epoch, the Pleistocene.\r\nBy comparing the fossil mammals of Europe with those of North America\r\nfor any particular division of geological time, it is practicable to\r\ndetermine whether the way of intermigration was open or closed, because\r\nseparation always led to greater differences between the faunas of the\r\ntwo continents through divergent evolution.\r\n\r\nCorrelation with South America is exceedingly difficult and it is in\r\ndealing with this problem that the widest differences of opinion have\r\narisen among geologists. Through nearly all the earlier half of the\r\nTertiary period the two Americas were separated and, because of this\r\nseparation, their land mammals were utterly different. Hence, the lack\r\nof elements common to both continents puts great obstacles in the way of\r\nestablishing definite time-relations between their geological divisions.\r\nOnly the marine mammals, whales and dolphins, were so far alike as to\r\noffer some satisfactory basis of comparison. When, in the later Tertiary,\r\na land-connection was established between the two continents, migrations\r\nof mammals from each to the other began, and thenceforward there were\r\nalways certain elements common to both, as there are to-day. In spite\r\nof the continuous land between them, the present faunas of North and\r\nSouth America are very strikingly different, South America being, with\r\nthe exception of Australia, zoölogically the most peculiar region of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn the following table of the South American Cenozoic, the assignment of\r\nthe ages to their epochs is largely tentative, especially as regards the\r\nmore ancient divisions, and represents the views generally held by the\r\ngeologists of Europe and the United States; those of South America, on\r\nthe contrary, give an earlier date to the ages and stages and refer the\r\nolder ones to the Cretaceous instead of the Tertiary.\r\n\r\n                       CENOZOIC ERA (South America)\r\n\r\n  Quaternary period { Recent epoch\r\n                    { Pleistocene epoch—Pampean Beds, Brazilian caverns\r\n\r\n                    {                 { Monte Hermoso age\r\n                    { Pliocene epoch  { Catamarca age\r\n                    {                 { Paraná age\r\n                    {\r\n  Tertiary period   { Miocene epoch   { Santa Cruz age\r\n                    {                 { Patagonian age\r\n                    {\r\n                    { Oligocene epoch { Deseado age (_Pyrotherium_ Beds)\r\n                    {                 { Astraponotus Beds\r\n                    {\r\n                    { Eocene epoch    { Casa Mayor age (_Notostylops_ Beds)\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene and Pliocene deposits are most widely distributed over\r\nthe Pampas of Argentina, but the former occur also in Ecuador, Brazil,\r\nChili, and Bolivia. The other formations cover extensive areas in\r\nPatagonia, and some extend into Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nWe have next to consider the methods by which past geographical\r\nconditions may be ascertained, a task which, though beset with\r\ndifficulties, is very far from being a hopeless undertaking. As has\r\nalready been pointed out, it is perfectly possible for the geologist to\r\ndetermine the circumstances of formation of the various kinds of rocks,\r\nto distinguish terrestrial from aquatic accumulations and, among the\r\nlatter, to identify those which were laid down in the sea and those which\r\nwere formed in some other body of water. By platting on a map all the\r\nmarine rocks of a given geological date, an approximate estimate may be\r\nformed as to the extension of the sea over the present land for that\r\nparticular epoch. It is obvious, however, that for those areas which\r\nthen were land and now are covered by the sea, no such direct evidence\r\ncan be obtained, and only indirect means of ascertaining the former\r\nland-connections can be employed. It is in the treatment of this indirect\r\nevidence that the greatest differences of opinion arise and, if two\r\nmaps of the same continent for the same epoch, by separate authors, be\r\ncompared, it will be seen that the greatest discrepancies between them\r\nare concerning former land-connections and extensions.\r\n\r\nThe only kind of indirect evidence bearing upon ancient land-connections,\r\nnow broken by the sea, that need be considered here is that derived from\r\nthe study of animals and plants, both recent and fossil. All-important in\r\nthis connection is the principle that the same or closely similar species\r\ndo not arise independently in areas between which there is no connection.\r\nIt is not impossible that such an independent origin of organisms which\r\nthe naturalist would class as belonging to the same species may have\r\noccasionally taken place, but, if so, it must be the rare exception to\r\nthe normal process. This principle leads necessarily to the conclusion\r\nthat the more recently and broadly two land-areas, now separated by the\r\nsea, have been connected, the more nearly alike will be their animals\r\nand plants. Such islands as Great Britain, Sumatra and Java must have\r\nbeen connected with the adjacent mainland within a geologically recent\r\nperiod, while the extreme zoölogical peculiarity of Australia can be\r\nexplained only on the assumption that its present isolation is of very\r\nlong standing. The principle applies to the case of fossils as well as to\r\nthat of modern animals, and has already been made use of, in a preceding\r\nsection, in dealing with the ancient land-connections of North America.\r\nIt was there shown that the connection of this continent with the Old\r\nWorld and the interruptions of that connection are reflected and recorded\r\nin the greater or less degree of likeness in the fossil mammals at any\r\nparticular epoch. Conversely, the very radical differences between the\r\nfossil mammals of the two Americas imply a long-continued separation\r\nof those two continents, and their junction in the latter half of the\r\nTertiary period is proved by the appearance of southern groups of mammals\r\nin the northern continent, and of northern groups in South America.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the connection between North and South America still\r\npersists, the geology of the Isthmus of Panama should afford testimony\r\nin confirmation of the inferences drawn from a study of the mammals. Of\r\ncourse, the separating sea did not necessarily cross the site of the\r\npresent isthmus; it might have cut through some part of Central America,\r\nbut a glance at the map immediately suggests the isthmus as the place\r\nof separation and subsequent connection. As a matter of fact, isthmian\r\ngeology is in complete accord with the evidence derived from the mammals.\r\nEven near the summit of the hills which form the watershed between the\r\nAtlantic and the Pacific and through which the great Culebra Cut passes,\r\nare beds of marine Tertiary shells, showing that at that time the land\r\nwas completely submerged. This does not at all preclude the possibility\r\nof other transverse seas at the same period; indeed, much of Central\r\nAmerica was probably under the sea also, but the geology of that region\r\nis still too imperfectly known to permit positive statements.\r\n\r\nWhen several different kinds of testimony, each independent of the other,\r\ncan be secured and all are found to be in harmony, the strength of the\r\nconclusion is thereby greatly increased. Many distinct lines of evidence\r\nsupport the inference that North and South America were completely\r\nsevered for a great part of the Tertiary period. This is indicated in the\r\nclearest manner, not only by the geological structure of the Isthmus and\r\nby the mammals, living and extinct, as already described, but also by the\r\nfresh-water fishes, the land-shells, the reptiles and many other groups\r\nof animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of marine fossils may render the same sort of service\r\nin elucidating the history of the sea as land-mammals do for the\r\ncontinents, demonstrating the opening and closing of connections between\r\nland-areas and between oceans. The sea, it is true, is one and undivided,\r\nthe continental masses being great islands in it, but, nevertheless,\r\nthe sea is divisible into zoölogical provinces, just as is the land.\r\nTemperature, depth of water, character of the bottom, etc., are factors\r\nthat limit the range of marine organisms, as climate and physical\r\nbarriers circumscribe the spread of terrestrial animals. Professor Perrin\r\nSmith has shown that in the Mesozoic era Bering Strait was repeatedly\r\nopened and closed, and that each opening and closing was indicated by\r\nthe geographical relationships of the successive assemblages of marine\r\nanimals that are found in the Mesozoic rocks of California and Nevada.\r\nWhen the Strait was open, the coast-line between North America and Asia\r\nwas interrupted and the North Pacific was cooled by the influx of water\r\nfrom the Arctic Sea. At such times, sea-animals from the Russian and\r\nSiberian coasts extended their range along the American side as far south\r\nas Mexico, and no forms from the eastern and southern shores of Asia\r\naccompanied them. On the other hand, when the Strait was closed, the\r\nArctic forms were shut out and the continuous coast-line and warmer water\r\nenabled the Japanese, Indian, and even Mediterranean animals to extend\r\ntheir range to the Pacific coast of North America. A comparison of the\r\nmarine fishes of the two sides of the Isthmus of Panama shows an amount\r\nand degree of difference between the two series as might be expected from\r\nthe length of time that they have been separated by the upheaval of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn working out the geographical conditions for any particular epoch\r\nof the earth’s history, it is possible to go much farther than merely\r\ngaining an approximate estimate of the distribution of land and sea; many\r\nother important facts may be gathered from a minute examination of the\r\nrocks in combination with a genetic study of topographical forms. By this\r\nphysiographical method, as it is called, the history of several of the\r\ngreat mountain-ranges has been elaborated in great detail. It is quite\r\npracticable to give a geological date for the initial upheaval and to\r\ndetermine whether one or many such series of movements have been involved\r\nin bringing about the present state of things. Similarly, the history of\r\nplains and plateaus, hills and valleys, lake and river systems, may be\r\nascertained, and for the earth’s later ages, at least, a great deal may\r\nbe learned regarding the successive forms of the land-surfaces in the\r\nvarious continents. It would be very desirable to explain the methods by\r\nwhich these results are reached, but this could hardly be done without\r\nwriting a treatise on physiography, for which there is no room in this\r\nchapter. We must be permitted to make use of the results of that science\r\nwithout being called upon to prove their accuracy.\r\n\r\nNo factor has a more profound effect in determining the character and\r\ndistribution of living things than climate, of which the most important\r\nelements, for our purpose, are temperature and moisture. One of the most\r\nsurprising results of geological study is the clear proof that almost all\r\nparts of the earth have been subjected to great vicissitudes of climate,\r\nand a brief account of the evidence which has led to this unlooked for\r\nresult will not be out of place here.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of climatic changes is of two principal kinds, (1) that\r\nderived from a study of the rocks themselves, and (2) that given by the\r\nfossils of the various epochs. So far as the rocks laid down in the sea\r\nare concerned, little has yet been ascertained regarding the climatic\r\nconditions of their formation, but the strata which were deposited on\r\nthe land, or in some body of water other than the sea, often give the\r\nmost positive and significant information concerning the circumstances of\r\nclimate which prevailed at the time of their formation. Certain deposits,\r\nsuch as gypsum and rock-salt, are accumulated only in salt lakes, which,\r\nin turn, are demonstrative proof of an arid climate. A salt lake could\r\nnot exist in a region of normal rainfall and, from the geographical\r\ndistribution of such salt-lake deposits, it may be shown that arid\r\nconditions have prevailed in each of the continents and, not only once,\r\nbut many times. As a rule, such aridity of climate was relatively local\r\nin extent, but sometimes it covered vast areas. For example, in the\r\nPermian, the last of the Palæozoic, and the Triassic, the first of the\r\nMesozoic periods (see Table, p. 15) nearly all the land-areas of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere were affected, either simultaneously or in rapid\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nUntil a comparatively short time ago, it was very generally believed that\r\nthe Glacial or Pleistocene epoch, which was so remarkable and conspicuous\r\na feature of the Quaternary period, was an isolated phenomenon, unique in\r\nthe entire history of the earth. Now, however, it has been conclusively\r\nshown that such epochs of cold have been recurrent and that no less than\r\nfive of these have left unmistakable records in as many widely separated\r\nperiods of time.\r\n\r\nWhen the hypothesis of a great “Ice Age” in the Pleistocene was first\r\npropounded by the elder Agassiz, it was naturally received with general\r\nincredulity, but the gradual accumulation of proofs has resulted in\r\nsuch an overwhelming weight of testimony, that the glacial hypothesis\r\nis now accepted as one of the commonplaces of Geology. The proofs\r\nconsist chiefly in the characteristic glacial accumulations, moraines\r\nand drift-sheets, which cover such enormous areas in Europe and North\r\nAmerica and, on a much smaller scale, in Patagonia, and in the equally\r\ncharacteristic marks of glacial wear left upon the rocks over which\r\nthe ice-sheets moved. Many years later it was proved that the Permian\r\nperiod had been a time of gigantic glaciation, chiefly in the southern\r\nhemisphere, when vast ice-caps moved slowly over parts of South America,\r\nSouth Africa, Australia and even of India. The evidence is of precisely\r\nthe same nature as in the case of the Pleistocene glaciation. In not less\r\nthan three more ancient periods, the Devonian, Cambrian, and Algonkian,\r\nproofs of glacial action have been obtained.\r\n\r\nWhile the rocks themselves thus afford valuable testimony as to the\r\nclimatic conditions which prevailed at the time and place of their\r\nformation, this testimony is fragmentary, missing for very long periods,\r\nand must be supplemented from the information presented by the fossils.\r\nAs in all matters where fossils are involved, the evidence must be\r\ncautiously used, for hasty inferences have often led to contradictory\r\nand absurd conclusions. When properly employed, the fossils give a more\r\ncontinuous and complete history of climatic changes than can, in the\r\npresent state of knowledge, be drawn from a study of the rocks alone.\r\nFor this purpose plants are particularly useful, because the great\r\ngroups of the vegetable kingdom are more definitely restricted in their\r\nrange by the conditions of temperature and moisture than are most of the\r\ncorrespondingly large groups of animals. Not that fossil animals are\r\nof no service in this connection; quite the contrary is true, but the\r\nevidence from them must be treated more carefully and critically. To\r\nillustrate the use of fossils as recording climatic changes in the past,\r\none or two examples may be given.\r\n\r\nIn the Cretaceous period a mild and genial climate prevailed over all\r\nthat portion of the earth whose history we know, and was, no doubt,\r\nequally the case in the areas whose geology remains to be determined.\r\nThe same conditions extended far into the Arctic regions, and abundant\r\nremains of a warm-temperate vegetation have been found in Greenland,\r\nAlaska and other Arctic lands. Where now only scanty and minute dwarf\r\nwillows and birches can exist, was then a luxuriant forest growth\r\ncomprising almost all of the familiar trees of our own latitudes, a most\r\ndecisive proof that in the Cretaceous the climate of the Arctic regions\r\nmust have been much warmer than at present and that there can have been\r\nno great accumulation of ice in the Polar seas. Conditions of similar\r\nmildness obtained through the earlier part of the Tertiary. In the Eocene\r\nepoch large palm-trees were growing in Wyoming and Idaho, while great\r\ncrocodiles and other warm-country reptiles abounded in the waters of the\r\nsame region.\r\n\r\nIt is of particular interest to inquire how far the fossils of Glacial\r\ntimes confirm the inferences as to a great climatic change which are\r\nderived from a study of the rocks, for this may be taken as a test-case.\r\nAny marked discrepancy between the two would necessarily cast grave doubt\r\nupon the value of the testimony of fossils as to climatic conditions.\r\nThe problem is one of great complexity, for the Pleistocene was not one\r\nlong epoch of unbroken cold, but was made up of Glacial and Interglacial\r\nages, alternations of colder and milder conditions, and some, at least,\r\nof the Interglacial ages had a climate warmer than that of modern times.\r\nSuch great changes of temperature led to repeated migrations of the\r\nmammals, which were driven southward before the advancing ice-sheets\r\nand returned again when the glaciers withdrew under the influence\r\nof ameliorating climates. Any adequate discussion of these complex\r\nconditions is quite out of the question in this place and the facts must\r\nbe stated in simplified form, as dealing only with the times of lowered\r\ntemperature and encroaching glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe plants largely fail us here, for little is known of Glacial\r\nvegetation, but, on the other hand, a great abundance of the fossil\r\nremains of animal life of that date has been collected, and its testimony\r\nis quite in harmony with that afforded by the ice-markings and the\r\nice-made deposits. Arctic shells in the marine deposits of England, the\r\nvalley of the Ottawa River and of Lake Champlain, Walruses on the coast\r\nof New Jersey, Reindeer in the south of France, and Caribou in southern\r\nNew England, Musk-oxen in Kentucky and Arkansas, are only a few examples\r\nof the copious evidence that the climate of the regions named in Glacial\r\ntimes was far colder than it is to-day.\r\n\r\nI have thus endeavored to sketch, necessarily in very meagre outlines,\r\nthe nature of the methods employed to reconstruct the past history of\r\nthe various continents and the character of the evidence upon which we\r\nmust depend. Should the reader be unconvinced and remain sceptical as to\r\nthe possibility of any such reconstruction, he must be referred to the\r\nnumerous manuals of Geology, in which these methods are set forth with a\r\nfulness which cannot be imitated within the limits of a single chapter.\r\nThe methods are sound, consisting as they do merely in the application of\r\n“systematized common sense” (in Huxley’s phrase) to observed facts, but\r\nby no means all applications of them are to be trusted. Not to mention\r\nill-considered and uncritical work, or inverted pyramids of hypothesis\r\nbalanced upon a tiny point of fact, it should be borne in mind that\r\nsuch a complicated and difficult problem as the reconstruction of past\r\nconditions can be solved only by successive approximations to the truth,\r\neach one partial and incomplete, but less so than the one which preceded\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF INVESTIGATION—PALÆONTOLOGICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nPalæontology is the science of ancient life, animal and vegetable, the\r\nZoölogy and Botany of the past, and deals with fossils. Fossils are the\r\nrecognizable remains or traces of animals or plants, which were buried in\r\nthe rocks at the time of the formation of those rocks. In a geological\r\nsense, the term _rock_ includes loose and uncompacted materials, such as\r\nsand and gravel, as well as solid stone. Granting the possibility of so\r\ndetermining the relative dates of formation of the rocks, that the order\r\nof succession of the fossils in time may be ascertained in general terms,\r\nthe question remains: What use, other than geological, can be made of the\r\nfossils? In dealing with this question, attention will be directed almost\r\nexclusively to the mammals, the group with which this book is concerned.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to the discussion, something should be said of the\r\nways in which mammals became entombed in the rocks in which we find\r\nthem. In this connection it should be remembered that, however firm and\r\nsolid those rocks may be now, they were originally layers of loose and\r\nuncompacted material, deposited by wind or water, and that each layer\r\n_formed in its turn the surface of the earth, until buried by fresh\r\naccumulations upon it_, it may be to enormous depths.\r\n\r\nOne method of the entombing of land-mammals, which has frequently been\r\nof great importance, is burial in volcanic dust and so-called ash, which\r\nhas been compacted into firm rock. During a great volcanic eruption\r\nenormous quantities of such finely divided material are ejected from the\r\ncrater and are spread out over the surrounding country, it may be for\r\ndistances of hundreds of miles. Thus will be buried the scattered bones,\r\nskeletons, carcasses, that happen to be lying on the surface; and if the\r\nfine fragments are falling rapidly, many animals will be buried alive and\r\ntheir skeletons preserved intact. A modern instance of this is given by\r\nthe numerous skeletons of men and domestic animals buried in the volcanic\r\nash which overwhelmed Pompeii in 79 A.D. Pliny the Younger, who witnessed\r\nthat first recorded eruption of Vesuvius, tells us in a letter written to\r\nTacitus, that far away at Misenum, west of Naples, it was often necessary\r\nto rise and shake off the falling ashes, for fear of being buried in\r\nthem. In the Santa Cruz formation of Patagonia (see p. 124), which has\r\nyielded such a wonderful number and variety of well-preserved fossils,\r\nthe bones are all found in volcanic dust and ash compacted into a rock,\r\nwhich is usually quite soft, but may become locally very hard. The\r\nBridger formation of Wyoming (p. 110) and the John Day of eastern Oregon\r\n(p. 116) are principally made up of volcanic deposits; and no doubt there\r\nare several others among the Tertiary stages which were formed in the\r\nsame way, but have not yet received the microscopic study necessary to\r\ndetermine this.\r\n\r\nMuch information concerning the mammalian life of the Pleistocene, more\r\nespecially in Europe and in Brazil (p. 211), has been derived from the\r\nexploration of caverns. Some of these caves were the dens of carnivorous\r\nbeasts and contain multitudes of the bones of their victims, as well as\r\nthose of the destroyers themselves. Others, such as the Port Kennedy\r\nCave, on the Schuylkill River above Philadelphia, the Frankstown Cave in\r\ncentral Pennsylvania, the Conard Fissure in Arkansas, are hardly caverns\r\nin the ordinary sense of the word, but rather narrow fissures, into\r\nwhich bones and carcasses were washed by floods, or living animals fell\r\nfrom above and died without being able to escape. The bones are mostly\r\nburied in the earth which partially or completely fills many caverns and\r\nmay be covered by a layer of stalagmite, derived from the solution and\r\nre-deposition of the limestone of the cavern-walls, by the agency of\r\npercolating waters.\r\n\r\nA mode of preservation which is unfortunately rare is exemplified by\r\nthe asphaltic deposits near Los Angeles, at Rancho La Brea, which have\r\nbeen very fully described by Professor J. C. Merriam of the University\r\nof California. The asphalt has been formed by the oxidation and\r\nsolidification of petroleum, which has risen up through the Pleistocene\r\nrocks from the oil-bearing shales below. At one stage in the conversion\r\nof petroleum into asphalt, tar-pools of extremely viscid and adhesive\r\ncharacter were, and still are, formed on the surface of the ground; and\r\nthese pools were veritable traps for mammals and birds and for the beasts\r\nand birds of prey which came to devour the struggling victims.\r\n\r\n“The manner in which tar or asphalt pools may catch unsuspecting animals\r\nof all kinds is abundantly illustrated at the present time in many places\r\nin California, but nowhere more strikingly than at Rancho La Brea itself,\r\nwhere animals of many kinds have frequently been so firmly entrapped that\r\nthey died before being discovered, or if found alive were extricated only\r\nwith the greatest difficulty. As seen at this locality, the tar issuing\r\nfrom springs or seepages is an exceedingly sticky, tenacious substance\r\nwhich is removed only with the greatest difficulty from the body of\r\nany animal with which it may come in contact. Small mammals, birds, or\r\ninsects running into the soft tar are very quickly rendered helpless\r\nby the gummy mass, which binds their feet, and in their struggles soon\r\nreaches every part of the body. Around the borders of the pools the tar\r\nslowly hardens by the evaporation of the lighter constituents until\r\nit becomes as solid as an asphalt pavement. Between the hard and soft\r\nportions of the mass there is a very indefinite boundary, the location of\r\nwhich can often be determined only by experiment, and large mammals in\r\nmany cases run into very tenacious material in this intermediate zone,\r\nfrom which they are unable to extricate themselves.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account refers to what may actually be observed at the\r\npresent time; in regard to the Pleistocene, Professor Merriam says:\r\n“In the natural accumulation of remains at the tar pools through\r\naccidental entangling of animals of all kinds, it is to be presumed that\r\na relatively large percentage of the individuals entombed would consist\r\nof young animals with insufficient experience to keep them away from\r\nthe most dangerous places, or with insufficient strength to extricate\r\nthemselves. There would also be a relatively large percentage of old,\r\ndiseased, or maimed individuals that lacked strength to escape when\r\nonce entangled. In the census of remains that have been obtained up to\r\nthe present time the percentages of quite young, diseased, maimed, and\r\nvery old individuals are certainly exceptionally large.... In addition\r\nto the natural accumulation of animal remains through the entangling\r\nof creatures of all kinds by accidental encountering of the tar, it is\r\napparent from a study of the collections obtained that some extraordinary\r\ninfluence must have brought carnivorous animals of all kinds into\r\ncontact with the asphalt with relatively greater frequency than other\r\nkinds of animals. In all the collections that have been examined the\r\nnumber of carnivorous mammals and birds represented is much greater than\r\nthat of the other groups.... Whenever an animal of any kind is caught\r\nin the tar, its struggles and cries naturally attract the attention of\r\ncarnivorous mammals and birds in the immediate vicinity, and the trapped\r\ncreature acts as a most efficient lure to bring these predaceous animals\r\ninto the soft tar with it. It is not improbable that a single small\r\nbird or mammal struggling in the tar might be the means of entrapping\r\nseveral carnivores, which in turn would naturally serve to attract\r\nstill others.... In the first excavations carried on by the University\r\nof California a bed of bones was encountered in which the number of\r\nsaber-tooth and wolf skulls together averaged twenty per cubic yard.”[1]\r\n\r\nAs the animals were thus entombed alive, it would be expected that a\r\nlarge number of complete skeletons would be preserved, but this is not\r\nthe case: “connected skeletons are not common.” This scattering and\r\nmingling of the bones were due partly to the trampling of the heavier\r\nanimals in their struggles to escape, but, in more important degree, to\r\nthe movements within the tar and asphalt.\r\n\r\nIn arid and semi-arid regions great quantities of sand and dust are\r\ntransported by the wind and deposited where the winds fail, or where\r\nvegetation entangles and holds the dust. Any bones, skeletons or\r\ncarcasses which are lying on the surface will thus be buried, and even\r\nliving animals may be suffocated and buried by the clouds of dust.\r\nAn example of such wind-made accumulations is the Sheridan formation\r\n(Equus Beds, see p. 131), which covers vast areas of the Great Plains\r\nfrom Nebraska to Mexico and contains innumerable bones, especially of\r\nhorses. In this formation in northwestern Kansas, Professor Williston\r\nfound nine skeletons of the large peccary (_†Platygonus leptorhinus_),\r\nlying huddled together, with their heads all pointing in the same\r\ndirection, and in the upper Miocene (p. 121) of South Dakota Mr. Gidley\r\ndiscovered six skeletons of three-toed horses (_†Neohipparion whitneyi_)\r\ncrowded together, killed and buried probably by a sandstorm. Similar\r\nillustrations might be gathered from many other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nSwamps and bogs may, especially under certain conditions, become the\r\nburial places of great numbers of animals, which venture into them,\r\nbecome buried and are unable to extricate themselves. Especially is\r\nthis true in times of great drought, when animals are not only crazed\r\nwith thirst, but very much weakened as well, and so unable to climb out\r\nof the clinging mud. In an oft-quoted passage, Darwin gives a vivid\r\ndescription of the effects of a long drought in Argentina between the\r\nyears 1827 and 1830. “During this time so little rain fell, that the\r\nvegetation, even to the thistles, failed; the brooks were dried up, and\r\nthe whole country assumed the appearance of a dusty high road.” “I was\r\ninformed by an eyewitness that the cattle in herds of thousands rushed\r\ninto the Paraná, and being exhausted by hunger they were unable to crawl\r\nup the muddy banks, and thus were drowned. The arm of the river which\r\nruns by San Pedro was so full of putrid carcasses, that the master of\r\na vessel told me that the smell rendered it quite impassable. Without\r\ndoubt several hundred thousand animals thus perished in the river; their\r\nbodies when putrid were seen floating down the stream; and many in all\r\nprobability were deposited in the estuary of the Plata. All the small\r\nrivers became highly saline, and this caused the death of vast numbers\r\nin particular spots; for when an animal drinks of such water it does\r\nnot recover. Azara describes the fury of the wild horses on a similar\r\noccasion, rushing into the marshes, those which arrived first being\r\noverwhelmed and crushed by those which followed. He adds that more than\r\nonce he has seen the carcasses of upwards of a thousand wild horses thus\r\ndestroyed.... Subsequently to the drought of 1827 to 1832, a very rainy\r\nseason followed, which caused great floods. Hence it is almost certain\r\nthat some thousands of the skeletons were buried by the deposits of the\r\nvery next year.”[2]\r\n\r\nIn the arid and desolate regions of the interior of South Australia is a\r\nseries of immense dry lakes, which only occasionally contain water and\r\nordinarily “are shallow, mud-bottomed or salt-encrusted claypans only.”\r\nOne of these, Lake Callabonna, is of great interest as having preserved\r\nin its soft mud many remains of ancient life, of creatures which were\r\nmired in the clay and destroyed, as has been described by Dr. E. C.\r\nStirling. “There is, however, compensation for the unpromising physical\r\nfeatures of Lake Callabonna in the fact that its bed proves to be a\r\nveritable necropolis of gigantic extinct marsupials and birds which\r\nhave apparently died where they lie, literally, in hundreds. The facts\r\nthat the bones of individuals are often unbroken, close together, and,\r\nfrequently, in their proper relative positions, the attitude of many of\r\nthe bodies and the character of the matrix in which they are embedded,\r\nnegative any theory that they have been carried thither by floods. The\r\nprobability is, rather, that they met their deaths by being entombed\r\nin the effort to reach food or water, just as even now happens in dry\r\nseasons, to hundreds of cattle which, exhausted by thirst and starvation,\r\nare unable to extricate themselves from the boggy places that they have\r\nentered in pursuit either of water or of the little green herbage due to\r\nits presence. The accumulation of so many bodies in one locality points\r\nto the fact of their assemblage around one of the last remaining oases\r\nin the region of desiccation which succeeded an antecedent condition of\r\nplenteous rains and abundant waters.”\r\n\r\nIt is a very general experience in collecting fossil mammals to find\r\nthat they are not evenly or uniformly distributed through the beds, but\r\nrather occur in “pockets,” where great numbers of individuals are crowded\r\ntogether, while between the “pockets” are long stretches of barren\r\nground. It is equally common to find the bones thickly distributed in\r\ncertain layers, or beds, and the layers above and below entirely wanting\r\nin fossils. The reasons for this mode of occurrence have been partially\r\nexplained in the foregoing paragraphs, but the reason differs for each\r\nparticular mode of entombment. The important part played by drought\r\nin causing such accumulation of closely crowded bodies in swamps and\r\nmud-holes is indicated in the quotations from Darwin and Stirling; but\r\nsimilar accumulations may take place on hard ground, as was observed in\r\ncentral Africa by Gregory. “Here and there around a water hole we found\r\nacres of ground white with the bones of rhinoceroses and zebra, gazelle\r\nand antelope, jackal and hyena.... These animals had crowded around\r\nthe dwindling pools and fought for the last drops of water.”[3] Even\r\nin normal seasons springs and water holes and the drinking places in\r\nstreams are the lurking places of beasts of prey and crocodiles, so that\r\ngreat accumulations of bones are made around these spots. A succession\r\nof unusually severe winters frequently leads to great mortality among\r\nmammals, as happened in Patagonia in the winter of 1899, when enormous\r\nnumbers of Guanaco perished of starvation on the shore of Lake Argentine,\r\nwhere they came to drink.\r\n\r\nBones which are exposed on the surface of the ground decay and crumble to\r\npieces in the course of a very few years; and if they are to be preserved\r\nas fossils, it is necessary that they should be buried under sedimentary\r\nor volcanic deposits. Several such modes of burial have been described\r\nin the foregoing paragraphs, but there are other and equally important\r\nmethods, which remain to be considered.\r\n\r\nThe deposits made by rivers are often extremely rich in fossils, and\r\nmost of the Tertiary formations of the Great Plains are now ascribed to\r\nthe agency of rivers. The flood-plain of a stream, or that part of its\r\nbasin which is periodically overflowed, is gradually built up by the\r\nlayers of clay and silt thrown down by the relatively still waters of the\r\nflooded area, and scattered bones, skeletons or carcasses that may have\r\nbeen lying on the ground before the freshet are buried in the deposits.\r\nBones covered up in this manner frequently show the marks of teeth of\r\nrodents or carnivores which have gnawed them when lying exposed. Deposits\r\nmade in the stream-channels, where the current was swiftest, are of\r\ncoarser materials such as gravel and sand, and these often contain the\r\nskeletons of animals which were drowned and swept downward by the flooded\r\nstream. When the Bison (the mistakenly so-called Buffalo) still roamed\r\nin countless herds over the western plains, immense numbers of them were\r\ndrowned in the upper Missouri River by breaking through the ice, when\r\nthey attempted to cross at times when the ice had not attained its winter\r\nthickness, or was weakened by melting in the spring. No doubt, the bed\r\nof that river contains innumerable bones of the Bison. Frequently, too,\r\nanimals are caught in quicksands and, unable to escape, are buried in the\r\nsoft mass; fossil skeletons which are preserved in sandstones in an erect\r\nor standing position are usually to be interpreted in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary accumulations formed in lakes and ponds sometimes yield\r\nfossil bones or skeletons in considerable numbers, which have, for the\r\nmost part, been derived from the carcasses of animals carried into the\r\nlake by streams. A newly drowned mammal sinks to the bottom and, if\r\nsufficient sediment be quickly deposited upon it, it may be anchored\r\nthere and fossilized as a complete skeleton. Otherwise, when distended by\r\nthe gases of putrefaction, the body will rise and float on the surface,\r\nwhere it will be attacked and pulled about by crocodiles, fishes and\r\nother predaceous creatures. As the bones are loosened in the course of\r\ndecomposition, they will drop to the bottom and be scattered, now here,\r\nnow there, over a wide area.\r\n\r\nLand mammals are rarely found in marine rocks, or such deposits as were\r\nmade on the sea-bottom; but the remains of marine mammals, whales,\r\nporpoises, dolphins, seals, etc. are often found in large numbers. In\r\nprinciple, the method of entombment is the same as in the case of lakes,\r\nbut currents may drift to some bay or cove multitudes of carcasses of\r\nthese marine mammals. At Antwerp, in Belgium, incredible quantities of\r\nsuch remains have been exposed in excavations and in all probability were\r\ndrifted by currents into a quiet and shallow bay, which was subsequently\r\nconverted into land.\r\n\r\nWhile the foregoing account by no means exhausts the various methods\r\nof accumulation and burial of the skeletons and scattered bones of\r\nmammals, it covers the more important of these methods sufficiently for\r\na general understanding of the different processes. In whatever manner\r\nthe preservation may have been effected, there is great difference in\r\nthe relative abundance and completeness among the fossils of the various\r\nkinds of mammals which were living at the same time and in the same\r\narea. It need hardly be said, that the more abundant any species was,\r\nthe better was the chance of its being represented among the fossils;\r\nhence, gregarious species, living in large herds, were more likely to be\r\npreserved than those which led a solitary existence, or were individually\r\nrare. Most of the hoofed mammals are and apparently always have been\r\ngregarious, and are therefore much better represented among the fossils,\r\nand are, in consequence, better known than the beasts of prey, which,\r\nof necessity, were individually less numerous and generally solitary\r\nin habits. Not only this, but large and medium-sized mammals, with\r\nstrong and heavy bones, were better fitted to withstand the accidents of\r\nentombment and subsequent preservation than small creatures with delicate\r\nand fragile skeletons. The mere dead weight of over-lying sediments often\r\ncrushes and distorts the bones, and the movements of uplift, compression,\r\nfolding and fracture, to which so many strata have been subjected, did\r\nstill further damage to the fossils. The percolating waters, which for\r\nages have traversed the porous rocks, often attack and dissolve the\r\nbones, completely destroying the minute ones and greatly injuring those\r\nwhich are massive and strong. In consequence of all those accidents it\r\nfrequently happens that only the teeth, the hardest and most resistant\r\nof animal structures, and it may be the dense and solid jaw-bones, are\r\nall that remain to testify of the former existence of some creature that\r\nlong ago vanished from the earth. Very many fossil mammals are known\r\nexclusively from the teeth, and it is this fact which makes the exact\r\nstudy of teeth so peculiarly important to the palæontologist.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these facts, it is not surprising that concerning the\r\nhistory of many mammalian groups we have but scanty information, or\r\nnone at all, while in the case of others the story is wonderfully full\r\nand detailed. The latter are, very generally, the groups which were\r\nnot only numerically abundant at all stages of their history, but also\r\nhad skeletons that were strong enough to resist destruction; while the\r\ngroups as to which there is little or no information are chiefly of\r\nsmall and fragile animals, or such as were always rare. For example,\r\na great deal has been learned regarding the development of horses and\r\nrhinoceroses in North America, but the history of the tapirs is very\r\nunsatisfactorily known, because, while horses and rhinoceroses were\r\ncommon, tapirs were solitary and rare. In Europe bats have been found in\r\nthe Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene, and there is no reason to suppose that\r\nthey were not equally ancient and equally abundant in America; but none\r\nhave been found in the western hemisphere in any formation older than\r\nthe Pleistocene. All things considered, the extraordinary fact is, not\r\nthat so many forms have irretrievably perished, but that so much has been\r\npreserved, escaping all the chances of destruction.\r\n\r\nAs to the degree of preservation in fossil mammals, we have to do almost\r\nentirely with bones and teeth. With very rare exceptions, and those\r\nall of late geological date, the viscera, muscles, skin, hair, horns,\r\nhoofs and claws have been completely destroyed and have vanished without\r\nleaving a trace. In northern Siberia the gravel soil is permanently\r\nfrozen to a depth of several hundred feet and contains the intact\r\ncarcasses of elephants and rhinoceroses of Pleistocene date and notably\r\ndifferent from any species of these animals now in existence. Sometimes\r\nsuch a carcass is disinterred from a bluff by the cutting action of a\r\nstream and is in a state of nearly complete preservation, with hide,\r\nhair and flesh almost as in an animal freshly killed. From these\r\nremains it has been learned that the †Mammoth was an elephant densely\r\ncovered with hair and wool, just as he was depicted in the carvings and\r\ncave-paintings of Pleistocene Man in Europe, where †Mammoth bones have\r\nbeen abundantly found, and also that there were Siberian rhinoceroses\r\nsimilarly protected against the cold. †Mammoth remains with hide and\r\nflesh, but much less complete, have likewise been found in Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn a cavern in southern Patagonia an expedition from the La Plata Museum\r\ndiscovered, with the remains of a gigantic, extinct †ground-sloth, large\r\npieces of the skin still covered with hair and affording most welcome\r\ninformation as to the colouration of these most curious animals. The skin\r\nhad been preserved from decay by deep burial in dry dust. Mummies of\r\nPleistocene rodents have been found in the dry caves of Portugal, whereas\r\nin the ordinary caves which are damp or wet, only bones are preserved.\r\nUnfortunately, as has been said, such instances of complete preservation\r\nare very rare, and none are known of mammals more ancient than those of\r\nthe Pleistocene epoch.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that the higher the geological antiquity\r\nof a skeleton is, the greater is the chemical alteration which it has\r\nundergone. Bones of Pleistocene or later date have, as a rule, suffered\r\nlittle change beyond the loss of more or less of their animal matter, the\r\namount of such loss depending chiefly upon exposure to the air. Bones\r\nwhich, for thousands or tens of thousands of years, have been buried in\r\ndense cave-earth, in an antiseptic peat-bog, or in asphalt, are often\r\nperfectly sound and fresh when taken up. Skeletons of the antecedent\r\n(Tertiary) period are, on the other hand, very frequently _petrified_;\r\nthat is to say, the original substance of the bones has been completely\r\nremoved and replaced by some stony material, most commonly lime or flint.\r\nThis substitution took place very gradually, molecule by molecule,\r\nso that not only is the form of the bone or tooth most accurately\r\nreproduced, but the internal, microscopic structure is perfectly retained\r\nand may be studied to as great advantage as in the case of modern\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nWhile, save in the rarest instances, only the hard parts of fossil\r\nmammals remain to testify of their structure, very important information\r\nas to the size, form and external character of the brain may be secured\r\nfrom “brain-casts,” which may be natural or artificial. The pressure\r\nof the mud, sand or other material, in which the fossil was embedded,\r\nfilled up all openings in the skeleton and, as the brain decayed and\r\ndisappeared, its place was taken by this material, which subsequently\r\nhardened and solidified and quite accurately reproduces the external form\r\nand character of the brain. When a fossil skull is exposed and shattered\r\nby weathering, the natural brain-cast often remains intact, and a great\r\nmany such specimens are in the collections. An artificial cast is made by\r\nsawing open the cranial cavity, cleaning out the stony matrix which fills\r\nit and then pouring liquid gelatine or plaster of Paris into the cavity.\r\nThese artificial casts are often quite as satisfactory as the natural\r\nones.\r\n\r\nAs has been shown above, the history of the mammals is recorded, save\r\nin a very few instances, in terms of bones and teeth and, to the\r\nuninitiated, it might well seem that little could be accomplished\r\nwith such materials. However, it is the task, and the perfectly\r\nfeasible task, of palæontology to make these dry bones live. It is a\r\ncurrent and exceedingly mischievous notion that the palæontologist can\r\nreconstruct a vanished animal from a single bone or tooth and, in spite\r\nof repeated slayings, this delusion still flourishes and meets one in\r\nmodern literature at every turn. No doubt, much of the scepticism with\r\nwhich attempts to restore extinct animals are met by many intelligent\r\npeople is traceable to the widespread belief that such off-hand and\r\neasy-going methods are used in the work. So far from being able to make\r\na trustworthy reconstruction from a few scattered bones, competent\r\npalæontologists have been sometimes led completely astray in associating\r\nthe separated parts of the same skeleton. More than once it has happened\r\nthat the dissociated skull and feet of one and the same animal have been\r\nassigned to entirely different groups, just because no one could have\r\nventured, in advance of experience, to suppose that such a skull and\r\nteeth could belong to a creature with such feet. In all these cases (and\r\nthey are few) the error has been finally corrected by the discovery of\r\nthe skeleton with all its essential parts in their natural connection.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of complete skeletons of Tertiary mammals as yet\r\ncollected is comparatively small, it is often possible to construct a\r\nnearly complete specimen from several imperfect ones, all of which can be\r\npositively shown to belong to the same species. Such composite skeletons\r\nare almost as useful as those in which all the parts pertain to a single\r\nindividual, though in making the drawings it is not easy to avoid\r\nslight errors of proportion. It must not be supposed that no successful\r\nrestoration of missing bones is practicable; on the contrary, this can\r\noften be done very easily, but only when all the essential parts of the\r\nskeleton are known.\r\n\r\nEven if an unlimited number of perfect skeletons were available, of\r\nwhat use would they be? A skeleton is a very different looking object\r\nfrom a living animal, and how is it possible to infer the latter from\r\nthe former? Do the many restorations of extinct mammals which this book\r\nowes to the skill of Mr. Horsfall and Mr. Knight deserve any other\r\nconsideration than that due to pleasing, graceful or grotesque fancies,\r\nwith no foundation of solid fact? To answer these questions, it is\r\nnecessary first to consider the relations of the bony structure to the\r\nentire organism and then to discuss the principles in accordance with\r\nwhich the restorations have been made.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton is far from being merely the mechanical frame-work of the\r\nanimal. Such a frame-work it is, of course, but it is much more than\r\nthat; it is the living and growing expression of the entire organism and\r\nis modified, not only by age, but by the conditions of the environment\r\nand accidental circumstances as well. The bones of the same individual\r\ndiffer very materially in early youth, maturity and old age; so long as\r\nthe animal lives, its bones are perpetually changing, slowly it is true,\r\nbut with ready response to needs. Not only that, but dislocated bones\r\nmay and frequently do develop entirely new joints, and their internal\r\nstructure is remodelled to meet the requirements of stresses differing\r\nin character or direction from those of normal, uninjured bones. The\r\ngeneral form and proportions of any mammal are determined chiefly by its\r\nmuscular system and this may be directly and confidently inferred from\r\nits skeleton, for the muscles which are of importance in this connection\r\nare attached to the bones and leave their indelible and unmistakable\r\nmark upon them. In any good text-book of anatomy this extremely intimate\r\nrelation of bone and muscle is made clear; and it is shown how each\r\nattachment of muscle, tendon and ligament is plainly indicated by rough\r\nlines, ridges, projections or depressions, which speak a language\r\nintelligible enough to those who have learned to interpret it. Given the\r\nskeleton, it is no very difficult task to reconstruct the muscular system\r\nin sufficient detail. Further, the teeth afford valuable information\r\nas to the food, habits and appearance of the animal, for the bulk of\r\nthe viscera, a significant element in the general form, is principally\r\nconditioned by the character of the diet.\r\n\r\nBeasts of prey, which live by catching and devouring other animals,\r\nhave a certain likeness to one another, even though they are in no\r\nwise related, except as all mammals are. The Thylacine, or so-called\r\n“Tasmanian Wolf” (_Thylacynus cynocephalus_), a marsupial and related\r\nto the opossums, is deceptively like the true wolves in appearance,\r\nalthough belonging to an order (Marsupialia) almost as widely separated\r\nfrom that to which the wolves belong (Carnivora) as two mammalian groups\r\nwell can be. This resemblance is as clearly indicated by the skeletons\r\nas by the living animals themselves, though the fundamental differences\r\nof structure which distinguish the marsupial from the carnivore are no\r\nless clearly displayed. Large herbivorous mammals too, though referable\r\nto very different orders, bear a strong resemblance to one another, the\r\ncharacteristic differences, so far as the living animal is concerned,\r\nappearing chiefly in the head. It was this general likeness that induced\r\nCuvier to form his order, “Pachydermata,” which comprised elephants,\r\nrhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, tapirs, etc., animals that are now\r\ndistributed into no less than three separate orders; aside from the head,\r\nall of these forms are quite distinctly similar in appearance.\r\n\r\nOf course, the external features, such as ears, tail, skin and hair,\r\nare most important factors in the general make-up of any mammal; and,\r\nas to these matters, the fossils leave us largely in the lurch, save\r\nin the all too rare cases, like the Siberian †Mammoth, in which these\r\nexternal features are actually preserved. Two artists may so restore the\r\nsame animal as to result in two very different pictures, and no one can\r\npositively decide between them; just as two modern mammals, which are\r\nclosely related and have very similar skeletons, may yet differ markedly\r\nin outward appearance, because of the different character of the skin,\r\nas do, for example, the Bornean and Indian rhinoceroses. Yet even in\r\ndealing with purely external features, we are not left altogether to\r\nconjecture. Ears of unusual size or form frequently leave some indication\r\nof this on the skull, and the presence or absence of a proboscis can\r\nnearly always be inferred with confidence from the character of the bones\r\nof the nose and muzzle. The length and thickness of the tail may be\r\ngenerally directly deduced from the caudal vertebræ, but whether it was\r\nclose-haired and cylindrical, or bushy, or tufted at the end, or flat and\r\ntrowel-shaped, as in the Beaver, is not determinable from the bones alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—Wild sow and pigs, showing the uniform colour of\r\nthe adult and stripes of the young.]\r\n\r\nMost uncertain of all the characters which determine outward appearance\r\nare the hair and the pattern of colouration; the Horse and Zebra differ\r\nmuch more decidedly in the living form than their skeletons would lead\r\none to expect, as do also the Lion, the Tiger and the Leopard. The\r\ncurious and exceptional colour-pattern of the Okapi, that remarkable\r\ngiraffe-like animal but lately discovered in the equatorial forests\r\nof western Africa, could never have been inferred from a study of the\r\nskeleton alone. However, even in the problem of colour-patterns there is\r\nmore to go upon than sheer guess-work, for certain definite principles\r\nof animal colouration have been ascertained; the great difficulty lies\r\nin the application of these principles to a particular case. It is quite\r\ncertain that the naked, hairless skin is never primitive, but always a\r\ncomparatively late acquisition and, in many mammalian orders, is not\r\nfound at all. Aside from a few domesticated animals, this type of skin\r\noccurs only in very large herbivorous mammals living in warm climates,\r\nsuch as elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses, in a few burrowers,\r\nand in marine mammals, like the walruses, whales, porpoises, etc.\r\nUseful hints as to the colouring of ancient and extinct forms may be\r\ngathered from a study of series of living animals, such as lizards and\r\nbutterflies, in which the development of a definite scheme of colouration\r\nmay be followed step by step. Young animals very frequently retain more\r\nor less distinct traces of the ancestral colouration, which disappear in\r\nthe adult, for the development of the individual is, in some respects\r\nat least, an abbreviated and condensed recapitulation of the history\r\nof the species. In many mammals which, in the adult condition, have a\r\nsolid body-colour, the young are striped or spotted, a strong indication\r\nthat these mammals were derived from striped or spotted ancestors. Thus,\r\nthe Wild Boar has a uniform body-colour in the full-grown stage, but\r\nthe pigs are longitudinally striped; many deer are spotted throughout\r\nlife, as in the Fallow Deer, the Axis Deer of India and others, but the\r\ngreat majority of the species, including all the American forms, have\r\nuniform colouration, while the fawns are always spotted. Lion cubs are\r\nalso spotted and the adults have a uniform tawny colour, and many such\r\nexamples might be given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—Fawns of the Mule Deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_).\r\nCompare with Fig. 83, p. 167. (By permission of the N. Y. Zoölog.\r\nSociety.)]\r\n\r\nThe study of colouration among existing animals has led to the conclusion\r\nthat in mammals the primitive colour-pattern was that of stripes, either\r\nlongitudinal or transverse and more probably the former. In the second\r\nstage these bands break up into spots, which still show the longitudinal\r\narrangement and may be either light on a dark ground, or dark on a light\r\nground. In a third stage the spots may again coalesce into stripes, the\r\ncourse of which is at right angles to that of the original stripes, or\r\nthe spots may disappear, leaving a uniform body-colour, lighter or white\r\non the belly. These changes of colour-pattern have not proceeded at a\r\nuniform rate in the various mammalian groups, or even within the same\r\ngroup, for an all-important factor is the mode of life of the particular\r\nanimal. In general, it may be said that the scheme of colour is such as\r\nto render its possessor inconspicuous, or even invisible, and many a\r\ncreature that seems to be very conspicuous and striking in a museum case\r\ncan hardly be seen at all when in its natural surroundings. Thus, Arctic\r\nmammals and birds, in their winter dress, are white; desert animals are\r\ntawny or sandy-brown; forest animals are frequently striped or spotted;\r\nwhile those that live on open plains are more commonly of uniform\r\ncolouration. There are exceptions to these rules, but they hold good for\r\nthe most part. From careful comparative study of the teeth and skeletons\r\na clew may be gained as to the habits of animals and from the habits\r\nsomething may be inferred as to the colouration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—_Tapirus terrestris_, 3 days old. Compare with\r\nFig. 137, p. 320. (By permission of W. S. Berridge, London.)]\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be misleading to claim a greater authority for these\r\nattempts at restoring a long-vanished life than can fairly be ascribed\r\nto them. The general form and proportions of the head, neck, body, tail,\r\nlimbs and feet may be deduced with a high degree of accuracy from the\r\nskeleton, while the external characters of skin, hair and colouration\r\nare largely conjectural, but not altogether imaginary. It cannot be\r\ndoubted that among the extinct mammals were many which, owing to some\r\nuncommon growth of subcutaneous fat, or some unusual local development\r\nof hair, were much more curious and bizarre in appearance than we can\r\nventure to represent them. If, for example, the Camel, the Horse,\r\nthe Lion and the Right Whale were extinct and known only from their\r\nskeletons, such restorations as we could make of them would assuredly go\r\nastray in some particulars. The Camel would be pictured without his hump,\r\nfor there is nothing in the skeleton to suggest it; the forelock, mane\r\nand characteristic tail of the Horse and the Lion’s mane would certainly\r\nnot be recognized; while the immense development of blubber in the head\r\nof the Whale gives to it a very different appearance from that which the\r\nskull would seem to indicate. Such cases are, however, exceptional and\r\nrestorations made by competent hands from complete skeletons probably\r\ngive a fair notion of the appearance of those animals when alive.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be sufficiently plain that the work of restoration is beset\r\nwith difficulties, but that there is no good ground for the uncritical\r\nscepticism which summarily rejects the results as being purely fanciful,\r\nor for the equally uncritical credulity which unhesitatingly accepts them\r\nas fully and incontestably accurate. It is altogether likely that one\r\nof the main sources of error consists in making the extinct animal too\r\nclosely resemble some existing species which is selected as a model.\r\n\r\nToo much space has perhaps been devoted to the problem of restoring the\r\nexternal form of these extinct mammals, a problem which, after all, is of\r\ndistinctly subordinate importance. The most valuable results which may be\r\ngained from a study of these fossil mammals are the answers which they\r\nafford to the great questions of relationship, classification and genetic\r\ndescent, and the light which they throw upon the processes of evolution\r\nand the course of geographical arrangement. The bones and teeth afford\r\nadmirable means of tracing the gradual steps of modification by which the\r\nmodern mammals have arisen from very different ancestors and of following\r\ntheir wanderings from region to region and continent to continent. It is\r\nto these questions that most of the subsequent chapters are devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSIFICATION OF THE MAMMALIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terminology and nomenclature of science form a great barrier, which\r\nonly too often shuts out the educated layman from following the course\r\nof investigation and keeping abreast of the discoveries in which he may\r\nbe particularly interested. No more frequent and heartfelt complaint\r\nis uttered than that which decries the “scientific jargon,” and one\r\nmight be tempted to think that this jargon was a superfluous nuisance,\r\ndeliberately adopted to exclude the uninitiated and guard the secrets\r\nof the temple from the curious intruder. As a matter of fact, however,\r\nthis terminology, though an unquestionable evil from one point of view,\r\nis an indispensable implement of investigation and description. Ordinary\r\nlanguage has far too few words for the purpose and most of the words that\r\nmight be used lack the all-important quality of precision. The vernacular\r\nnames of animals and plants are notoriously inexact and, even when not\r\ninaccurately employed, are not sufficiently refined and distinctive\r\nfor scientific use. This is pre-eminently true of the New World, where\r\nthe European settlers gave the names of the creatures with which they\r\nhad been familiar at home to the new animals which they found in the\r\nwestern hemisphere. Some of these names, such as deer, wolf, fox, bear,\r\nare accurate enough for ordinary purposes, while others are ludicrously\r\nwrong. The bird that we call the Robin is altogether different from his\r\nEuropean namesake, and the great stag, or Wapiti, is commonly called\r\n“Elk,” a name which properly belongs to the Moose. In short, it is\r\nimpossible to gain the necessary accuracy and abundance of vocabulary\r\nwithout devising an artificial terminology, drawn chiefly from Greek and\r\nLatin.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with fossils, the difficulty of nomenclature becomes\r\nformidable indeed. The larger and more conspicuous mammals of the modern\r\nworld are more or less familiar to all educated people, and such names\r\nas rhinoceros, hippopotamus, elephant, kangaroo, will call up a definite\r\nand fairly accurate image of the animal in question. For the strange\r\ncreatures that vanished from the earth ages before the appearance of Man\r\n_there are no vernacular names_ and it serves no good purpose to coin\r\nsuch terms. To the layman names like _Uintatherium_ or _Smilodon_ convey\r\nno idea whatever, and all that can be done is to attempt to give them a\r\nmeaning by illustration and description, using the name merely as a peg\r\nupon which to hang the description.\r\n\r\nThe system of zoölogical classification which is still in use was\r\nlargely the invention of the Swedish naturalist Linnæus, who published\r\nit shortly after the middle of the eighteenth century. As devised by\r\nLinnæus, the scheme was intended to express ideal relationships, whereas\r\nnow it is employed to express real genetic affinities, so far as these\r\ncan be ascertained. The Linnæan system is an organized hierarchy of\r\ngroups, arranged in ascending order of comprehensiveness. In this scheme,\r\nwhat may be regarded as the unit is the _species_, a concept around\r\nwhich many battles have been waged and concerning which there is still\r\nmuch difference of opinion and usage. Originally a term in logic, it\r\nfirst received a definite meaning in Zoölogy and Botany from John Ray\r\n(1628-1705) who applied it to indicate a group of animals, or plants,\r\nwith marked common characters and freely interbreeding. Linnæus, though\r\nnot always consistent in his expressions on the subject, regarded species\r\nas objective realities, concrete and actual things, which it was the\r\nnaturalist’s business to discover and name, and held that they were fixed\r\nentities which had been separately created. This belief in the fixity\r\nand objective reality of species was almost universally held, until\r\nthe publication of Darwin’s “Origin of Species” (1859) converted the\r\nbiological world to the evolutionary faith, which declares that the only\r\nobjective reality among living things is the individual animal or plant.\r\n\r\nAccording to this modern conception, a species may be defined as\r\nsignifying a “grade or rank assigned by systematists to an assemblage of\r\norganic forms which they judge to be more closely interrelated by common\r\ndescent than they are related to forms judged to be outside the species”\r\n(P. Chalmers Mitchell). The technical name of a species, which is either\r\nin Latin, or in latinized form, is in two words, one of which designates\r\nthe genus (see below) and the other the particular species of that genus,\r\nas, for example, _Equus caballus_, the species Horse, _E. przewalskii_,\r\nthe Asiatic Wild Horse, _E. asinus_, the species Ass, etc. In order to\r\nidentify a species, the genus to which it belongs must be stated, hence\r\nthe term, _binomial system_ of nomenclature, which Linnæus introduced,\r\nbecoming _trinomial_ when the name of a subspecies is added, a modern\r\nrefinement on the older method. A very large species (_i.e._ one which\r\nis represented by great numbers of individuals), extending over a very\r\nlarge area, is often divisible into groups of minor rank, as _varieties_,\r\n_geographical races_ or _subspecies_. Taking the species as the unit\r\nin the scheme of classification, the varieties and subspecies may be\r\nconsidered as fractions.\r\n\r\nThere is great difference of usage among writers on systematic zoölogy\r\nin the manner of applying the generally accepted concept of species,\r\nsome making their groups very much more comprehensive than others,\r\naccording as they are “lumpers” or “splitters,” to employ the slang\r\nphrase. The difficulty lies in the fact that there are no fixed and\r\ndefinite criteria, by which a given series of individuals can be surely\r\ndistinguished as a variety, a species or a genus; it is a matter for the\r\njudgment and experience of the systematist himself. The individuals of a\r\nspecies may differ quite widely among themselves, provided that they are\r\nall connected by intergradations, and the more or less constant varieties\r\nor subspecies are to be distinguished from the individual variants,\r\nwhich are inconstant and fluctuating. No two specimens agree exactly\r\nin every particular, but if a very large suite of them be compared, it\r\nwill be found that the great majority depart but little from the average\r\nor norm of the species, and the wider the departure from the norm, the\r\nfewer the individuals which are so aberrant. Taking so easily measured\r\na character as size, for example, and measuring several hundred or a\r\nthousand representatives of some species, we see that a large majority\r\nare of average size, a little more or a little less, while very large\r\nor very small individuals are rare in proportion to the amount by which\r\nthey exceed or fall short of the norm. Subspecies or varieties are marked\r\nby differences which are relatively constant, but not of sufficient\r\nimportance to entitle them to rank as species.\r\n\r\nA group of the second rank is called a _genus_, which may contain few\r\nor many species, or only a single one. In the latter case the species\r\nis so isolated in character that it cannot properly be included in\r\nthe same genus with any other species. A large genus, one containing\r\nnumerous species, is frequently divisible into several _subgenera_, each\r\ncomprising a group of species which are more similar to one another than\r\nthey are to the other species of the genus.\r\n\r\nThe third of the main groups in ascending order is the _family_, which\r\nordinarily consists of a number of genera united by the possession of\r\ncertain common characters, which, at the same time, distinguish them\r\nfrom other genera, though a single isolated genus may require a separate\r\nfamily for its reception. Just as it is often convenient to divide a\r\ngenus into subgenera, so families containing many genera are usually\r\ndivisible into _subfamilies_, as indicative of closer relationships\r\nwithin the family. The name of the family is formed from that of the\r\ngenus first described or best known, with the termination _-idæ_, while\r\nthat for the subfamily is _-inæ_. To take an example, all the genera\r\nof cats, living and extinct, are assembled in the family Felidæ (from\r\nthe genus _Felis_) which falls naturally into two subfamilies. One of\r\nthese, the Felinæ, includes the true cats, a very homogeneous group,\r\nboth the existing and the extinct genera; the other subfamily, that of\r\nthe highly interesting series of the “Sabre-tooth Tigers,” called the\r\n†Machairodontinæ, comprises only extinct forms.\r\n\r\nThe fourth principal rank or grade is the _order_, distinguished by some\r\nfundamental peculiarity of structure and usually including a large number\r\nof families. Some of the orders, however, contain but a single family, a\r\nsingle genus, or even, it may be, a single species, because that species\r\nis in important structural characters so unlike any other that it cannot\r\nproperly be put into the same order with anything else. Such isolation\r\ninvariably implies that the species or genus in question is the sole\r\nsurvivor of what was once an extensive series. As in the case of the\r\nfamily and the genus, it is often necessary to recognize the degrees\r\nof closer and more remote affinity by the use of _suborders_. Existing\r\nArtiodactyla, or even-toed hoofed animals, an enormous assemblage,\r\nmay conveniently be divided into four suborders: (1) Suina, swine and\r\nthe Hippopotamus; (2) Tylopoda, the Camel and Llama; (3) Tragulina,\r\n“mouse-deer,” or chevrotains; (4) Pecora, or true ruminants, deer,\r\ngiraffes, antelopes, sheep, goats, oxen, etc. In nearly all of the orders\r\nsuch subordinal divisions are desirable and it is frequently useful to\r\nemploy still further subdivisions, like _superfamilies_, which are groups\r\nof allied families within the suborder, _sections_ and the like.\r\n\r\nIn the Linnæan scheme, the next group in ascending rank is the _class_,\r\nwhich includes all mammals whatsoever, but the advance of knowledge has\r\nmade it necessary to interpolate several intermediate grades between the\r\nclass and the order, which, in the descending scale, are _subclass_,\r\n_infraclass_, _cohort_, _superorder_ and others, while above the class\r\ncomes the _subkingdom_ of Vertebrata, or animals with internal skeletons,\r\nwhich includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes.\r\n\r\nA word should be said as to the conventions of printing technical names.\r\nThe names of all species are, in American practice, printed in small\r\nletters, but many Europeans write specific terms which are proper nouns\r\nor adjectives with a capital. Generic, family and all groups of higher\r\nrank are always written with a capital, unless used in vernacular form,\r\n_e.g._ Artiodactyla and artiodactyls. It is also a very general custom to\r\ngive capitals to vernacular names of species, as the Mammoth, the Coyote,\r\nthe Black Bear. Genus and species are almost invariably in italics,\r\ngroups of higher rank in roman.\r\n\r\nSuch a scheme of classification as is outlined above has a decidedly\r\nartificial air about it and yet it serves a highly useful purpose in\r\nenabling us to express in brief and condensed form what is known or\r\nsurmised as to the mutual relationships of the great and diversified\r\nassemblage of mammals. The scheme has been compared to the organization\r\nof an army into company, battalion, regiment, brigade, division,\r\narmy corps, etc., and there is a certain obvious likeness; but the\r\ndifferences go deeper, for an army is an assemblage of similar units,\r\nmechanically grouped into bodies of equal size. A much closer analogy\r\nis the genealogical or family tree, which graphically expresses the\r\nrelationships and ramifications of an ancient and widespread family,\r\nthough even this analogy may easily be pushed too far. Blood-relationship\r\nis, in short, the underlying principle of all schemes of classification\r\nwhich postulate the theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe system of Linnæus, as expanded and improved by modern zoölogists,\r\nhas proved itself to be admirably adapted to the study of the living\r\nworld; but it is much more difficult to apply it to the fossils, for\r\nthey introduce a third dimension, so to speak, for which the system was\r\nnot designed. This third dimension is the successive modification in\r\ntime of a genetically connected series. The cumulative effect of such\r\nmodifications is so great that only very elastic definitions will include\r\nthe earlier and later members of an unbroken series. In attempting to\r\napply the Linnæan system to the successive _faunas_ (_i.e._ assemblages\r\nof animals) which have inhabited the earth, palæontologists have employed\r\nvarious devices. One such method is to classify each fauna without\r\nreference to those which precede and follow it, but this has the great\r\ndrawback of obscuring and ignoring the relationships, to express which\r\nis the very object of classification. Another and more logical method\r\nis to treat species and genera as though they belonged to the present\r\norder of things, for these groups, particularly species, were relatively\r\nshort-lived, when regarded from the standpoint of geological time, and\r\neither became so modified as to require recognition as new species and\r\ngenera, or died out without leaving descendants. Groups of higher rank,\r\nfamilies, orders, etc., are treated as _genetic series_ and include the\r\nprincipal line or stock and such side-branches as did not ramify too\r\nwidely or depart too far from the main stem. Under the first arrangement,\r\nthe horses, a long history of which has been deciphered, would be divided\r\ninto several families; under the second, they are all included in a\r\nsingle family.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting results of palæontological study is the\r\ndiscovery that in many families, such as the horses, rhinoceroses and\r\ncamels, there are distinct series which independently passed through\r\nparallel courses of development, the series of each family keeping a\r\nremarkably even pace in the degree of progressive modification. Such a\r\nminor genetic series within a family is called a _phylum_, not a very\r\nhappy selection, for the same term had been previously employed in a\r\nmuch wider sense, as equivalent to the subkingdom. In both uses of the\r\nterm the underlying principle, that of genetic series, is the same; the\r\ndifference is in the comprehensiveness of meaning.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that no method, yet devised, of applying the Linnæan\r\nscheme to the fossils is altogether satisfactory, and indeed it is only\r\nthe breaks and gaps in the palæontological record which makes possible\r\nany use of the scheme. Could we obtain approximately complete series\r\nof all the animals that have ever lived upon the earth, it would be\r\nnecessary to invent some entirely new scheme of classification in order\r\nto express their mutual relationships.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of knowledge, classification can be made only in\r\na preliminary and tentative sort of way and no doubt differs widely\r\nfrom that which will eventually be reached. So far as the mammals are\r\nconcerned, part of the problem would seem to be quite easy and part\r\naltogether uncertain. Some mammalian groups appear to be well defined and\r\nentirely natural assemblages of related forms, while others are plainly\r\nheterogeneous and artificial, yet there is no better way of dealing with\r\nthem until their history has been ascertained. The mutual relations of\r\nthe grand groups, or orders, are still very largely obscure.\r\n\r\nThe class Mammalia is first of all divided into two subclasses of\r\nvery unequal size. Of these, the first, PROTOTHERIA, is represented\r\nin the modern world by few forms, the so-called Duck-billed Mole\r\n(_Ornithorhynchus paradoxus_) and Spiny Anteaters (_Echidna_) of\r\nAustralia. They are the lowest and most primitive of the mammals and\r\nretain several structural characters of the lower vertebrates. Their\r\nmost striking characteristic is that the young are not brought forth\r\nalive, but are hatched from eggs, as in the reptiles, birds and lower\r\nvertebrates generally.\r\n\r\nThe second subclass, EUTHERIA, which includes all other mammals, is\r\nagain divided into two very unequal groups or infraclasses. One of\r\nthese, DIDELPHIA, contains but a single order, the Marsupialia, or\r\npouched mammals, now in existence, and is also very primitive in many\r\nrespects, though far more advanced than the Prototheria. The young,\r\nthough born alive, are brought forth in a very immature state and, with\r\nthe exception of one genus (_Perameles_) the fœtus is not attached by\r\na special structure, the placenta, to the womb of the mother. Like the\r\nPrototheria, the Marsupials, which were once spread all over the world,\r\nare at present almost entirely confined to Australia and the adjoining\r\nislands, the Opossums of North and South America, and one small genus\r\n(_Cænolestes_) in the latter continent being the exceptions to this\r\nrule of distribution. The second and vastly larger infraclass, the\r\nMONODELPHIA, is characterized by the _placenta_, a special growth, partly\r\nof fœtal and partly of maternal origin, by means of which the unborn\r\nyoung are attached to the mother and nourished during the fœtal period;\r\nthey are born in a relatively mature state and are generally able to walk\r\nimmediately after birth and resemble their parents in nearly all respects.\r\n\r\nThe vast assemblage of placental mammals, which range over all the\r\ncontinents, are divided into numerous orders, most of which appear to be\r\nnatural groups of truly related forms, while some are but doubtfully so\r\nand others again are clearly unnatural and arbitrary. As has already been\r\npointed out, the mutual relationships of these orders, as expressed in\r\ngroups of higher than ordinal rank, offer a much more difficult problem,\r\nchiefly because our knowledge of the history of mammals is most deficient\r\njust where that history is most important and significant, namely, in its\r\nearlier portion. In many instances, the evolution of genera and families\r\nmay be followed out within the limits of the order in a very convincing\r\nway, but very rarely can the origin of an order be demonstrated. When the\r\nhistory began to be full and detailed, the orders had nearly all been\r\nestablished, and, until the steps of their divergence and differentiation\r\ncan be followed out, their mutual relationships can be discussed only\r\nfrom the standpoint of their likenesses and differences. In the valuation\r\nof these, there is much room for difference of opinion, and such\r\ndifference is not lacking. On the other hand, concerning the number and\r\nlimits of the orders themselves there is very general agreement.\r\n\r\nIn the following table only the major groups are included and those which\r\nare extinct are marked with a dagger (†). The scheme is almost identical\r\nwith that given in Professor Osborn’s “Age of Mammals,” the few points\r\nin which I should prefer a somewhat different arrangement being waived\r\nin the interests of uniformity and avoidance of confusion. A few changes\r\nare, however, made in matters which I regard as too important to ignore.\r\n\r\n  I. SUBCLASS PROTOTHERIA. Egg-laying Mammals.\r\n    1. ORDER =†PROTODONTA=.\r\n    2.

The evolutionary changes, so far as these are preserved, are\r\nrecorded therefore in terms of dental and skeletal modifications. To\r\nrender these changes intelligible, it is necessary to give some account\r\nof the mammalian skeleton and teeth, with no more use of technical\r\nlanguage than is unavoidable; ordinary speech does not furnish a\r\nsufficient number of terms, nor are most of these sufficiently precise.\r\nWith the aid of the figures, the reader may easily gain a knowledge of\r\nthe skeleton which is quite adequate for the discussion of fossil series,\r\nwhich will follow in the subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SKELETON\r\n\r\nI. The most obvious distinction of the skeletal parts is into _axial_\r\nand _appendicular_ portions, the former comprising the skull, backbone\r\nor _vertebral column_, ribs and breast-bone or _sternum_, and the latter\r\nincluding the limb-girdles, limbs and feet. In the axial skeleton\r\nonly the ribs and certain bones of the skull are paired, but in the\r\nappendicular all the bones are in pairs, for the right and left sides\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—Skull of Wolf (_Canis occidentalis_). _P.Mx._,\r\npremaxillary. _Mx._, maxillary. _Na._, nasal. _L._, lachrymal. _Ma._,\r\nmalar or jugal. _Fr._, frontal. _Pa._, parietal. _Sq._, squamosal.\r\n_Zyg._, zygomatic process of squamosal. _O.S._, orbitosphenoid. _Pl._,\r\npalatine. _M._, mandible. _cor._, coronoid process of mandible. _m.c._,\r\ncondyle of mandible. _ang._, angular process of mandible. _p.g._,\r\npostglenoid process of squamosal. _Ty._, tympanic (auditory bulla).\r\n_mas._, mastoid. _p.oc._, paroccipital process. _con._, occipital\r\ncondyle. _Ex.O._, exoccipital. _S.O._, supraoccipital.]\r\n\r\nThe _skull_ is a highly complex structure, made up of many parts, most\r\nof which are immovably fixed together, and performing many functions of\r\nsupreme importance. In the first place, it affords secure lodgement and\r\nprotection for the brain and higher organs of sense, those of smell,\r\nsight and hearing, and second, it carries the teeth and, by its movable\r\njaws, enables these to bite, to take in and masticate food. The portion\r\nof the skull which carries the brain, eyes and ears, is called the\r\n_cranium_, and the portion in front of this is the face, the boundary\r\nbetween the two being an oblique line drawn immediately in front of the\r\neye-socket (Fig. 7). A great deal of the endless variety in the form of\r\nthe skull of different mammals depends upon the differing proportions\r\nof cranium and face. In the human skull, for example, the cranium is\r\nenormously developed and forms a great dome, while the face is shortened\r\nalmost to the limit of possibility; the skull of the Horse, on the other\r\nhand, goes to nearly the opposite extreme of elongation of the facial and\r\nshortening of the cranial region. The posterior surface of the skull,\r\nor _occiput_, is made up of four bones, which in most adult mammals are\r\nfused into a single _occipital_ bone. At the base of the occiput is\r\na large opening, the _foramen magnum_, through which the spinal cord\r\npasses to its junction with the brain; and on each side of the opening\r\nis a large, smooth, oval prominence, the _occipital condyles_, by means\r\nof which the skull is articulated with the neck. The _paroccipital\r\nprocesses_ are bony styles of varying length, which are given off, one\r\non each side external to the condyles. The boundary of the occiput\r\nis marked by a ridge, the _occipital crest_, which varies greatly in\r\nprominence, but is very well marked in the more primitive forms and tends\r\nto disappear in the more highly specialized ones. The roof and much of\r\nthe sides of the cranium are formed by two pairs of large bones, the\r\n_parietals_ behind and the _frontals_ in advance; along the median line\r\nof the cranial roof, where the two parietals meet, is usually another\r\nridge, the _sagittal crest_, which joins the occipital crest behind.\r\nThe sagittal crest also varies greatly in prominence, being in some\r\nmammals very high and in others entirely absent, and, like the occipital\r\ncrest, is a primitive character; as a rule, it is longest and highest in\r\nthose mammals which have the smallest brain-capacity. As pointed out by\r\nProfessor Leche, the development of the sagittal crest is conditioned\r\nby the relative proportions of the brain-case and the jaws. Powerful\r\njaws and a small brain-case necessitate the presence of the crest, in\r\norder to provide sufficient surface of attachment for the temporal\r\nmuscles, which are important in mastication, while with large brain-case\r\nand weak jaws the crest is superfluous. Though the brain-case proper\r\nmay be quite small, yet it may have its surface enormously increased\r\nby great thickening of the cranial bones, as is true of elephants and\r\nrhinoceroses, and in them sufficient surface for attachment is afforded\r\nto the muscles without the development of a crest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—Skull of Wolf, top view. _P.Mx._, premaxillary.\r\n_Na._, nasal. _Ma._, malar or jugal. _L._, lachrymal. _Fr._, frontal.\r\n_Sq._, squamosal. _Pa._, parietal. _S.O._, supraoccipital.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Skull of Wolf, view of base. _P.Mx._,\r\npremaxillary. _Mx._, palatine process of maxillary. _Pl._, palatine.\r\n_Fr._, frontal. _Pt._, parietal. _Ma._, malar or jugal. _Sq._, glenoid\r\ncavity of squamosal. _B.S._, basisphenoid. _B.O._, basioccipital. _Ty._,\r\ntympanic (auditory bulla). _p.oc._, paroccipital process. _con._,\r\noccipital condyle. _S.O._, supraoccipital.]\r\n\r\nThe structure of these cranial bones, more particularly of the parietals,\r\nis subject to important changes; in most mammals they are of moderate\r\nthickness and have dense layers, or “tables,” forming the outer and\r\ninner surfaces and, between these, a layer of spongy bone. In many large\r\nmammals, however, especially those which have heavy horns or tusks, the\r\ncranial bones become enormously thick and the spongy layer is converted\r\ninto a series of communicating chambers, or _sinuses_, the partitions\r\nbetween which serve as braces, thus making the bone very strong in\r\nproportion to its weight. Sinuses are very generally present in the\r\nfrontals and communicate by small openings with the nasal passage, even\r\nin genera of moderate size and without horns or tusks. The frontals\r\nform the roof of the eye-sockets, or _orbits_, and usually there is\r\na projection from each frontal, which marks the hinder border of the\r\norbit and is therefore called the _postorbital_ process. The roof of the\r\nfacial region is made by the _nasals_, which are commonly long and narrow\r\nbones, but vary greatly in form and proportions in different mammals;\r\nin those which have a proboscis, like tapirs and elephants, or a much\r\ninflated snout, such as the Moose (_Alce_) or the Saiga Antelope (_Saiga\r\ntatarica_) the nasals are always very much shortened and otherwise\r\nmodified in form.\r\n\r\nThe anterior end of the skull is formed by a pair of rather small bones,\r\nthe _premaxillaries_, which carry the incisor teeth; they bound the sides\r\nof the nasal opening, or _anterior nares_, reaching to the nasals, when\r\nthe latter are of ordinary length; they also form the front end of the\r\nhard or bony palate, which divides the nasal passage from the mouth.\r\nThe _maxillaries_, or upper jaw-bones, make up nearly all of the facial\r\nregion on each side and send inward to the median line from each side a\r\nbony plate which together constitute the greater part of the hard palate;\r\nthe remainder of the upper teeth are implanted in the maxillaries. A\r\nvarying proportion of the hinder part of the hard palate is formed by the\r\n_palatines_, which also enclose the _posterior nares_, the opening by\r\nwhich the nasal passage enters the back part of the mouth. The maxillary\r\nof each side extends back to the orbit, which it bounds anteriorly and\r\nin the antero-superior border of which is the usually small _lachrymal_.\r\nThe inferior, and more or less of the anterior, border of the orbit is\r\nmade by the cheek-bone (_malar_ or _jugal_) which may or may not have a\r\npostorbital process extending up toward that of the frontal; when the\r\ntwo processes meet, the orbit is completely encircled by bone, but only\r\nin monkeys, apes and Man is there a bony plate given off from the inner\r\nside of the postorbital processes, which extends to the cranial wall and\r\nconverts the orbit into a funnel-shaped cavity. For most of its length,\r\nthe jugal projects freely outward from the side of the skull and extends\r\nposteriorly beneath a similar bar of bone, the _zygomatic process_ of\r\nthe _squamosal_. This process and the jugal together constitute the\r\n_zygomatic arch_, which on each side of the skull stands out more or\r\nless boldly, and the size and thickness of which are subject to great\r\nvariation in different mammals, the massiveness of the arch being\r\nproportional to the power of the jaws. One of the principal muscles of\r\nmastication (the _masseter_) is attached to the zygomatic arch.\r\n\r\nThe squamosal itself is a large plate, which makes up a great part of\r\nthe side-wall of the cranium and articulates above with the frontal and\r\nparietal; it also supports the lower jaw, the articular surface for which\r\nis called the _glenoid cavity_. The lower jaw is held in place by the\r\n_postglenoid process_, which is a projection, usually a transverse ridge,\r\nbehind the cavity. Back of the postglenoid process is the entrance to\r\nthe middle ear, the _auditory meatus_, which may be merely an irregular\r\nhole, or a more or less elongated tube. The meatus is an opening into\r\nthe _tympanic_, a bone which at birth is a mere ring and in some mammals\r\nremains permanently in that condition, but as a rule develops into a\r\nswollen, olive-shaped _auditory bulla_, which sometimes reaches enormous\r\nproportions, especially in nocturnal mammals. The labyrinth of the\r\ninternal ear is contained in the _periotic_, a very dense bone which is\r\nconcealed in the interior of the cranium, but in many mammals a portion\r\nof it, the _mastoid_, is exposed on the surface between the squamosal and\r\noccipital.\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw-bone (_inferior maxillary_, or _mandible_) is the only\r\nfreely movable element of the skull; it consists of two halves which\r\nmeet anteriorly at the chin in a contact of greater or less length,\r\ncalled the _symphysis_. In nearly all young mammals and in many adult\r\nforms the two halves of the lower jaw are separate and are held together\r\nat the symphysis only by ligaments, while in others, as in Man, they\r\nare indistinguishably fused to form a single bone. Each half consists\r\nof two portions, a horizontal part or _ramus_ and an _ascending ramus_\r\nor vertical part; the former supports all of the lower teeth, and its\r\nlength, depth and thickness are very largely conditioned by the number\r\nand size of those teeth. The ascending ramus is a broad, rather thin\r\nplate, divided at the upper end into two portions, the hinder one of\r\nwhich terminates in the _condyle_, a rounded, usually semicylindrical\r\nprojection, which fits into the glenoid cavity of the squamosal. The\r\nanterior portion of the ascending ramus ends above in the _coronoid\r\nprocess_, which serves for the insertion of the temporal muscle, the\r\nupper portion of which is attached to the walls of the cranium and thus,\r\nwhen the muscle is contracted, the jaws are firmly closed; the coronoid\r\nprocess passes inside of the zygomatic arch. The lower jaw is therefore\r\na lever of the third order, in which the power is applied between the\r\nweight (_i.e._ the food, the resistance of which is to be overcome) and\r\nthe fulcrum, which is the condyle. At the postero-inferior end of the\r\nascending ramus is the _angle_, the form of which is characteristically\r\nmodified in the various mammalian orders and is thus employed for\r\npurposes of classification.\r\n\r\nThe _hyoid arch_ is a U-shaped series of small and slender bones, with an\r\nunpaired element closing the arch below; each vertical arm of the U is\r\nattached to the tympanic of its own side and the whole forms a flexible\r\nsupport for the tongue, but with no freely movable joint like that\r\nbetween the lower jaw and the squamosal.\r\n\r\nThe mammalian skull in its primitive form may be thought of as a tube\r\ndivided into two parts, of which the hinder one is the brain-chamber, or\r\ncranial cavity, and the forward one the nasal chamber or passage. With\r\nthe growth of the brain and consequent enlargement of the cranium, this\r\ntubular character is lost; and various modifications of the teeth, jaws\r\nand facial region, the development of horns and tusks, bring about the\r\nmany changes which the skull has undergone.\r\n\r\nThis brief sketch of the skull-structure is very incomplete, several\r\nof its elements having been altogether omitted and only those parts\r\ndescribed which are needful in working out the history and descent of the\r\nvarious mammalian groups.\r\n\r\nThe second portion of the axial skeleton is the backbone, or _vertebral\r\ncolumn_, which is made up of a number of separate bones called\r\n_vertebræ_. These are so articulated together as to permit the necessary\r\namount of flexibility and yet retain the indispensable degree of\r\nstrength. The function of the backbone is a twofold one: (1) to afford\r\na firm support to the body and give points of attachment to the limbs,\r\nand (2) to carry the spinal cord, or great central axis of the nervous\r\nsystem, in such a manner that it shall be protected against injury, a\r\nmatter of absolutely vital necessity.\r\n\r\nWhile the vertebræ differ greatly in form and appearance in the various\r\nregions of the neck, body and tail, in adaptation to the various degrees\r\nof mobility and strength which are required of them, yet they are all\r\nconstituted upon the same easily recognizable plan. The principal mass\r\nof bone in each vertebra is the body, or _centrum_, which is typically a\r\ncylinder, or modification of that form, and the two ends of the cylinder\r\nare the _faces_, by which the successive vertebræ are in contact with one\r\nanother. In the living animal, however, the successive centra are not in\r\nactual contact, but are separated by disks of _cartilage_ (gristle) which\r\ngreatly add to the elasticity of the column. From the upper surface of\r\nthe centrum arises an arch of bone, the _neural arch_, enclosing with\r\nthe centrum the _neural canal_, through which runs the spinal cord. As\r\nalready mentioned, the protection of the spinal cord is essential to the\r\nlife of the animal, yet this protection must be combined with a certain\r\nflexibility, both lateral and vertical. Mere contact of the centra, even\r\nthough these be held in place by ligaments, would not give the column\r\nstrength to endure, without dislocation, the great muscular stresses\r\nwhich are put upon it. Additional means of articulation between the\r\nsuccessive vertebræ are therefore provided, and these vary in size, form\r\nand position in different regions of the backbone, in nice adjustment\r\nto the amount of motion and degree of strength needed at any particular\r\npart of the column. Of these additional means of articulation, which are\r\ncalled the _zygapophyses_, each vertebra has two pairs, an anterior and\r\na posterior pair, placed upon the neural arch. From the summit of the\r\narch arises the _neural spine_, a more or less nearly straight rod or\r\nplate of bone, which may be enormously long or extremely short, massive\r\nor slender, in accordance with the muscular attachments which must be\r\nprovided for. Finally, should be mentioned the _transverse processes_,\r\nrod-like or plate-like projections of bone, which arise, one on each\r\nside of the vertebra, usually from the centrum, less commonly from the\r\nneural arch; these also differ greatly in form and size in the various\r\nregions of the column. Anatomists distinguish several other processes of\r\nthe vertebra, but for our purpose it is not necessary to take these into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—First dorsal vertebra of Wolf from the front.\r\n_cn._, centrum. _r._, facet for the head of the rib. _r′._, facet for\r\nthe tubercle of the rib. _tr._, transverse process. _pr.z._, anterior\r\nzygapophyses. _n.sp._, neural spine.]\r\n\r\nFive different regions of the backbone may be distinguished, in each of\r\nwhich the vertebræ are modified in a characteristic way. There is (1) the\r\n_cervical_ region, or neck, the vertebræ of which, among mammals (with\r\nonly one or two exceptions) are always seven in number, however long or\r\nshort the neck may be; the immoderately long neck of the Giraffe has no\r\nmore and the almost invisible neck of the Whale has no less, and thus\r\nthe elongation of the neck is accomplished by lengthening the individual\r\nvertebræ and not by increasing their number. (2) Those vertebræ to which\r\nribs are attached are named _dorsal_ or _thoracic_ and can always be\r\nrecognized by the pits or articular facets which receive the heads of the\r\nribs. (3) Behind the dorsal is the _lumbar_ region, or that of the loins,\r\nmade up of a number of vertebræ which carry no ribs. The dorso-lumbars\r\nare known collectively as the _trunk-vertebræ_ and are generally quite\r\nconstant in number for a given group of mammals, though often differently\r\ndivided between the two regions in different members of the same\r\ngroup. In the Artiodactyla, for example, there are very constantly 19\r\ntrunk-vertebræ, but the Hippopotamus has 15 dorsals and 4 lumbars, the\r\nReindeer (_Rangifer_) 14 D., 5 L., the Ox (_Bos taurus_) 13 D., 6 L.,\r\nthe Camel (_Camelus dromedarius_) 12 D. and 7 L. (4) Next follows the\r\n_sacrum_, which consists of a varying number of coalesced vertebræ. The\r\nnumber of sacral vertebræ varies from 2 to 13, but is usually from 3 to\r\n5. (5) Finally, there are the _caudal_ vertebræ, or those of the tail,\r\nwhich are extremely variable in number and size, depending upon the\r\nlength and thickness of the tail.\r\n\r\nWe must next consider briefly some of the structural features which\r\ncharacterize the vertebræ of the different regions. (1) The length of\r\nthe neck varies greatly in different mammals and, up to a certain point,\r\nflexibility increases with length, but, as the number of 7 cervicals is\r\nalmost universally constant among mammals and the lengthening of the\r\nneck is accomplished by an elongation of the individual vertebræ, a\r\npoint is eventually reached, where greater length is accompanied by a\r\ndiminution of mobility. For instance, in the Giraffe the movements of the\r\nneck are rather stiff and awkward, in striking contrast to the graceful\r\nflexibility of the Swan’s neck, which has 23 vertebræ, more than three\r\ntimes as many.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Atlas of Wolf, anterior end and left side.\r\n_cot._, anterior cotyles. _n.c._, neural canal. _n.a._, neural arch.\r\n_tr._, transverse process. _v.a._, posterior opening of the canal for the\r\nvertebral artery.]\r\n\r\nThe first two cervical vertebræ are especially and peculiarly modified,\r\nin order to support the skull and give to it the necessary degree of\r\nmobility upon the neck. The first vertebra, or _atlas_, is hardly more\r\nthan a ring of bone with a pair of oval, cuplike depressions (_anterior\r\ncotyles_) upon the anterior face (superior in Man) into which are fitted\r\nthe occipital condyles of the skull. By the rolling of the condyles\r\nupon the atlas is effected the nodding movement of the head, upward\r\nand downward, but not from side to side; this latter movement is\r\naccomplished by the partial rotation of skull and atlas together upon\r\nthe second vertebra in a manner presently to be explained. On the hinder\r\naspect are two articular surfaces (_posterior cotyles_) in shape like\r\nthe anterior pair, but very much less concave, which are in contact\r\nwith corresponding surfaces on the second vertebra. The neural arch of\r\nthe atlas is broad and low and the neural canal is apparently much too\r\nlarge for the spinal cord, but, in fact, only a part of the circular\r\nopening belongs to the neural canal. In life, the opening is divided by\r\na transverse ligament into an upper portion, the true neural canal, and\r\na lower portion, which lodges a projection from the second vertebra.\r\nThe atlas usually has no neural spine and never a prominent one; the\r\ntransverse processes are broad, wing-like plates and each is perforated\r\nby a small canal, which transmits the vertebral artery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—Axis of Wolf, left side. _od.p._ odontoid\r\nprocess. _cot._, anterior cotyles. _n.a._, neural arch. _n.sp._, neural\r\nspine. _pt.z._, posterior zygapophyses. _tr._, transverse process.\r\n_v.a′._, anterior opening of canal for the vertebral artery. _v.a″._,\r\nposterior opening of the same.]\r\n\r\nThe second vertebra, or _axis_, is a little more like the ordinary\r\nvertebra, having a definite and usually elongate centrum, on the anterior\r\nend of which are the two articular surfaces for the atlas. Between these\r\nis a prominent projection, the _odontoid process_, which fits into the\r\nring of the atlas and has a special articulation with the lower bar of\r\nthat ring. In most mammals the odontoid process is a bluntly conical peg,\r\nvarying merely in length and thickness, but in many long-necked forms\r\nthe peg is converted into a semicylindrical spout, convex on the lower\r\nside and concave above. The neural spine of the axis is almost always a\r\nrelatively large, hatchet-shaped plate, which is most developed in the\r\ncarnivorous forms, and the transverse processes are commonly slender rods.\r\n\r\nThe five succeeding cervical vertebræ are much alike, though each one has\r\na certain individuality, by which its place in the series may readily\r\nbe determined. The centrum has a convex anterior and concave posterior\r\nface, which in long-necked animals form regular “ball and socket” joints;\r\nneural spines are frequently wanting and, when present, are almost always\r\nshort and slender; the zygapophyses are very prominent and are carried\r\non projections which extend before and behind the neural arch; the\r\ntransverse processes are long, thin plates and, except in the seventh\r\ncervical, are usually pierced by the canal for the vertebral artery, but\r\nin a few forms (_e.g._ the camels) this canal pierces the neural arch.\r\n\r\n(2) The dorsal or thoracic vertebræ have more or less cylindrical centra,\r\nwith nearly flat faces, and on the centra, for the most part at their\r\nends, are the concave facets for the rib-heads. The transverse processes\r\nare short and rod-like and most of them articulate with the tubercles of\r\nthe ribs. The zygapophyses are smaller than in the cervical region, less\r\nprominent and less oblique; the anterior pair, on the front of the neural\r\narch, face upward and the posterior pair downward. The neural spines are\r\nvery much longer than those of the neck and those of the anterior dorsals\r\nare often of relatively enormous length, diminishing toward the hinder\r\npart of the region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Fifth cervical vertebra of Wolf, left side.\r\n_tr._, transverse process. _v.a″._, posterior opening of canal for\r\nthe vertebral artery. _pr.z._ and _pt.z._, anterior and posterior\r\nzygapophyses. _n.sp._, neural spine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—First dorsal vertebra of Wolf, left side. _c._,\r\ncentrum. _r._, anterior rib-facet. _r″._, posterior rib-facet. _tr._,\r\ntransverse process. _pr.z_. _pt.z._, anterior and posterior zygapophyses.\r\n_n.sp._, neural spine.]\r\n\r\n(3) The lumbar vertebræ are almost always heavier and larger than those\r\nof the dorsal region; they carry no ribs and their neural spines and\r\ntransverse processes are broad and plate-like and the latter are far\r\nlarger and more prominent than those of the dorsals. As an especial\r\ndegree of strength is frequently called for in the loins, together with\r\na greater flexibility than is needed in the dorsal region, the modes of\r\narticulation between the successive vertebræ are more complex, sometimes,\r\nas in the Edentata, most elaborately so. Taking the dorso-lumbars, or\r\ntrunk-vertebræ, as a single series, we may note that in a few mammals\r\n(_e.g._ the elephants) all the neural spines have a backward slope, but\r\nin the great majority of forms this backward inclination ceases near the\r\nhinder end of the dorsal region, where there is one vertebra with erect\r\nspine, while behind this point the spines slope forward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—Third lumbar vertebra of Wolf, front end and left\r\nside. _tr._, transverse process. _cn._, centrum. _pr.z._ and _pt.z._,\r\nanterior and posterior zygapophyses. _n.sp._, neural spine.]\r\n\r\n(4) The sacral vertebræ, varying from 2 to 13 in number, are fused\r\ntogether solidly into one piece, the combined centra forming a heavy mass\r\nand the neural canals a continuous tube, while the neural spines are\r\nunited into a ridge. As a rule, only the first two vertebræ of the sacrum\r\nare in contact with the hip-bones, to support which they have developed\r\nspecial processes, the remainder of the mass projecting freely backward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Sacrum of Wolf, upper side. _I_, _II_, _III_,\r\nfirst, second and third sacral vertebræ. _pl._, surface for attachment to\r\nhip-bone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Caudal vertebræ of Wolf, from anterior and middle\r\nparts of the tail. Letters as in Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n(5) The caudal vertebræ vary greatly, in accordance with the length and\r\nthickness of the tail. In an animal with well-developed tail several\r\nof the anterior caudals have the parts and processes of a typical\r\nvertebra, centrum, neural arch and spine, zygapophyses and transverse\r\nprocesses. Posteriorly, these gradually diminish, until only the centrum\r\nis left, with low knobs or ridges, which are the remnants of the various\r\nprocesses. A varying number of long, cylindrical centra, diminishing\r\nbackward in length and diameter, complete the caudal region and the\r\nvertebral column. In some mammals, _chevron bones_ are attached to\r\nthe under side of the anterior and middle caudals; these are forked,\r\nY-shaped bones, which form a canal for the transmission of the great\r\nblood-vessels of the tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Ribs of Wolf from anterior and middle parts of\r\nthe thorax. _cp._, head, _t._, tubercle.]\r\n\r\nThe _ribs_, which are movably attached to the backbone, together with\r\nthe dorsal vertebræ and breast-bone, compose the _thorax_, or chest. The\r\narticulation with the vertebræ is by means of a rounded head; in most\r\ncases the head has two distinct facets, the pit being formed half on\r\nthe hinder border of one dorsal vertebra and half on the front border\r\nof the next succeeding one, but posteriorly the pit is often shifted,\r\nso as to be on a single vertebra. A second articulation is by means of\r\nthe _tubercle_, a smooth projecting facet on the convexity of the rib’s\r\ncurvature and near the head; the tubercle articulates with the transverse\r\nprocess of its vertebra. The ribs, in general, are curved bars of bone,\r\nwhich in small mammals generally and in the clawed orders are slender\r\nand rod-like, while in the hoofed mammals they are broader, thinner and\r\nmore plate-like, especially the anterior ones. The number of pairs of\r\nribs is most commonly 13, but ranges among existing mammals from 9 in\r\ncertain whales to 24 in the Two-toed Sloth (_Cholœpus didactylus_). The\r\ncomplex curvature of the ribs, outward and backward, is such that, when\r\nthey are drawn forward (in Man upward) by muscular action, the cavity of\r\nthe thorax is enlarged and air is drawn into the lungs, and when they are\r\nallowed to fall back, the cavity is diminished and the air expelled.\r\n\r\nBelow, a varying number of the ribs are connected by the cartilages in\r\nwhich they terminate with the breast-bone (_sternum_); sometimes these\r\ncartilages are ossified and then form the _sternal ribs_, but there is\r\nalways a flexible joint between the latter and the true ribs. In certain\r\nedentates, notably the anteaters and the extinct †ground-sloths, these\r\nsternal ribs, at their lower ends, are provided with head and tubercle,\r\nfor articulation with the sternum.\r\n\r\nThe _sternum_, or breast-bone, is made up of a number of distinct\r\nsegments, usually broad and flat, but often cylindrical, which may\r\nunite, but far more commonly remain separate throughout life. The\r\nnumber, size and form of these segments often give useful characters in\r\nclassification. The first segment, or _manubrium_, has quite a different\r\nshape from the succeeding ones and is considerably longer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—Sternum and rib-cartilages of Wolf, lower side.\r\n_P.S._, manubrium. _X.S._, xiphisternum.]\r\n\r\nII. The appendicular skeleton consists of the limb-girdles and the bones\r\nof the limbs and feet. The limb-girdles are the means of attaching the\r\nmovable limbs to the body, so as to combine the necessary mobility with\r\nstrength. The anterior, or _shoulder-girdle_, has no direct articulation\r\nwith the vertebral column, but is held in place by muscles; it is made up\r\nof the shoulder-blade and collar-bone, though very many mammals have lost\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Left scapula of Wolf. _gl._, glenoid cavity.\r\n_c._, coracoid. _ac._, acromion. _sp._ spine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Left scapula of Horse. This figure is much more\r\nreduced than Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Left scapula of Man in position of walking on all\r\nfours. Letters as in Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe shoulder-blade, or _scapula_, is a broad, thin, plate-like bone,\r\nwhich contracts below to a much narrower neck, ending in a concave\r\narticular surface, the _glenoid cavity_, for the head of the upper\r\narm-bone, the two together making the shoulder-joint. On the outer side\r\nthe blade is divided into two parts by a prominent ridge, the _spine_,\r\nwhich typically ends below in a more or less conspicuous projection,\r\nthe _acromion_, which may, however, be absent, its prominence being,\r\ngenerally speaking, correlated with the presence of the collar bone. A\r\nhook-like process, the _coracoid_, rises from the antero-internal side of\r\nthe glenoid cavity and varies greatly in size in the different groups of\r\nmammals; though it usually appears to be merely a process of the scapula,\r\nwith which it is indistinguishably fused, yet its development shows it to\r\nbe a separate element and in the lowest mammals (Prototheria), as in the\r\nreptiles and lower vertebrates generally, it is a large and important\r\npart of the shoulder-girdle and articulates with the sternum.\r\n\r\nThe collar-bone, or _clavicle_, is a complexly curved bar, which,\r\nwhen present and fully developed, extends from the forward end of the\r\nsternum to the acromion, the projecting lower end of the scapular spine,\r\nsupporting and strengthening the shoulder-joint. In many mammalian\r\norders, notably all existing hoofed animals, the clavicle has become\r\nsuperfluous and is lost more or less completely; it may be said, in\r\ngeneral, that the clavicle is developed in proportion to the freedom\r\nof motion of the shoulder-joint and to the power of rotation of the\r\nhand upon the arm. In arboreal animals, such as monkeys, in which the\r\nhand rotates freely and the arm moves in any direction on the shoulder,\r\nthe clavicle is large and fully developed, as it also is in Man. Many\r\nburrowing mammals (_e.g._ the moles) have very stout clavicles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Left clavicle of Man, front side.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—Left hip-bone of Wolf. _Il._, ilium. _Is._,\r\nischium. _P._, pubis. _ac._, acetabulum.]\r\n\r\nThe posterior, or _pelvic_, girdle is composed on each side of a very\r\nlarge, irregularly shaped bone, which is firmly attached to one or more\r\nof the coalesced vertebræ which form the sacrum and thus affords a solid\r\nsupport to the hind leg. Each half of the _pelvis_, or hip-bone, is made\r\nup of three elements, called respectively the _ilium_, _ischium_ and\r\n_pubis_, which are separate in the very young animal, indistinguishably\r\nfused in the adult. The three elements unite in a deep, hemispherical\r\npit, the _acetabulum_, which receives the head of the thigh-bone, a\r\nperfect example of the “ball and socket joint.” In the inferior median\r\nline the two pubes meet and may become coalesced, in a _symphysis_,\r\nthe length of which differs in various mammals. The pelvis and sacrum\r\ntogether form a short, wide tube, the diameter of which is normally\r\ngreater in the female skeleton than in the male.\r\n\r\nThe limbs are each divided into three segments, which in the anterior\r\nextremity are the arm, fore-arm and hand (or fore foot) and in the\r\nposterior extremity are the thigh, leg and foot (or hind foot), and there\r\nis a general correspondence between the structure of these segments in\r\nthe fore and hind legs, however great the superficial difference. The\r\nbones of the limbs, as distinguished from those of the feet, are the\r\n_long bones_ and, except in a few very large and heavy mammals, are\r\nessentially hollow cylinders, thus affording the maximum strength for a\r\ngiven weight of bone; the cavity of a long bone contains the marrow and\r\nhence is called the _medullary cavity_. In the young mammal each of the\r\nlong bones consists of three parts, the _shaft_, which makes up much the\r\ngreater part of the length, and at each end a bony cap, the _epiphysis_.\r\nGrowth takes place by the intercalation of new material between the shaft\r\nand the epiphyses; when the three parts unite, growth ceases and the\r\nanimal is adult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—Left humerus of Wolf, from the front and outer\r\nsides, the latter somewhat oblique. _h._, head. _int.t._, internal\r\ntuberosity. _ext.t._, external tuberosity. _bc._, bicipital groove.\r\n_dt._, deltoid ridge. _sh._, shaft. _s._, supinator ridge. _int. epi._,\r\ninternal epicondyle. _s.f._, anconeal foramen. _tr._, trochlea. _tr′._,\r\ntrochlea, posterior side. _ext. epi._, external epicondyle. _a.f._,\r\nanconeal fossa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—Left humerus of Horse, front side. _i.t._,\r\ninternal tuberosity. _ex.t._, external tuberosity. _bc._, outer part of\r\nbicipital groove. _dt._, deltoid ridge. _s._, supinator ridge. _tr._,\r\ntrochlea.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—Left humerus of Man, front side. Letters as in\r\nFig. 25.]\r\n\r\nThe superior segment of the fore limb has a single bone, the _humerus_,\r\nthe upper end of which is the rounded, convex _head_, which fits into\r\nthe glenoid cavity of the shoulder-blade, forming the joint of the\r\nshoulder; in front of the head are two prominent and sometimes very\r\nlarge projections for muscular attachment, the _external_ and _internal\r\ntuberosities_, separated by a groove, in which play the two tendons of\r\nthe biceps muscle and is therefore called the _bicipital groove_. In a\r\nfew mammals, such as the Horse, Camel and Giraffe, the groove is divided\r\ninto two by a median tubercle or ridge. From the external tuberosity\r\nthere generally passes down the front face of the shaft a rough and\r\nsometimes very prominent ridge, the _deltoid crest_, to which is attached\r\nthe powerful _deltoid_ muscle. At the lower end of the humerus is the\r\n_trochlea_, an irregular half-cylinder, for articulation with the two\r\nbones of the fore-arm and varying in form according to the relative\r\nsizes of those bones. On each side of the trochlea is frequently a\r\nrough prominence, the _epicondyle_, and above the inner one is, in many\r\nmammals, a perforation, the _epicondylar foramen_, for the passage of a\r\nnerve. Extending up the shaft from the outer epicondyle is a rough crest,\r\nthe _supinator ridge_, to which is attached one of the muscles that\r\nrotate the hand and is conspicuously developed in those mammals which\r\nhave the power of more or less free rotation and especially in burrowers.\r\nOn the posterior face of the humerus, just above the trochlea, is a\r\nlarge, deep pit, the _anconeal fossa_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—Left fore-arm bones of Wolf, front side. _R._,\r\nradius. _U._, ulna. _ol._, olecranon. _h._, head of radius.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—Left fore-arm bones of Man, front side. Letters\r\nas in Fig. 28. The small object at the right of each figure is the head\r\nof the radius, seen from above.]\r\n\r\nThe two bones of the fore-arm, the _radius_ and _ulna_, are, in most\r\nmammals, entirely separate from each other, but in certain of the more\r\nhighly specialized hoofed animals are immovably coössified. Primitively,\r\nthe two bones were of nearly equal size, but in most of the mammalian\r\norders there is a more or less well-defined tendency for the radius to\r\nenlarge at the expense of the ulna. These bones are normally crossed, the\r\nradius being external at the upper end and passing in front of the ulna\r\nto the inner side of the arm. The radius varies considerably in form in\r\naccordance with the uses to which the hand is put; if the capacity of\r\nrotation is retained, the upper end, or head, of the radius is small,\r\ncircular or disk-like, covering little of the humeral trochlea, but when\r\nthe head of the radius is broadened to cover the whole width of the\r\nhumerus, then all power of rotation is lost. (Cf. Figs. 28 and 29.) As a\r\nrule, the radius broadens downward and covers two-thirds or more of the\r\nbreadth of the wrist-bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—Coössified bones of left fore-arm of Horse, front\r\nside. For most of its length, the ulna is concealed by the radius.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—Left fore-arm bones of the Tapir (_Tapirus\r\nterrestris_). _R._, radius. _U._, ulna. _h._, head of radius. _h′._,\r\nsigmoid notch of ulna. _ol._, olecranon. N.B. This figure is on a much\r\nlarger scale than Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe ulna is longer than the radius, its upper end being extended into\r\na heavy process, the _olecranon_, or _anconeal process_, into which is\r\ninserted the tendon of the great triceps muscle, the contraction of\r\nwhich straightens the arm; this process is the bony projection at the\r\nback of the elbow-joint. Below the olecranon is a semicircular articular\r\nconcavity, which embraces the humeral trochlea and its upper angle fits\r\ninto the anconeal fossa of the humerus. The ulna contracts and grows more\r\nslender downwards and its lower end covers but one of the wrist-bones.\r\nWhile in the more primitive mammals, and in those which retain the power\r\nof rotating the hand, the ulna has nearly or quite the same thickness\r\nas the radius, it is often much more slender and in the more highly\r\nspecialized of the hoofed animals, such as the horses, camels and true\r\nruminants, the radius carries the entire weight and the ulna has become\r\nvery slender, more or less of its middle portion is lost and the two\r\nends are coössified with the radius, so that the fore-arm appears to have\r\nbut a single bone. The reverse process of enlarging the ulna and reducing\r\nthe radius is very rare and practically confined to the elephant tribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—Left manus of Wolf, front side. _SL._,\r\nscapho-lunar. _Py._, pyramidal. _Pis._, pisiform. _Tm._, trapezium.\r\n_Td._, trapezoid. _M._, magnum. _U._, unciform. _Mc.

The bones\r\nof the wrist constitute the _carpus_, those of the back and palm the\r\n_metacarpus_, and those of the fingers the _phalanges_.\r\n\r\nThe carpus consists primitively of nine distinct bones, though one of\r\nthese, as will be shown later, is not a true carpal. These bones are\r\nof a rounded, subangular shape, closely appressed together, with very\r\nlittle movement between them, and are arranged in two transverse rows.\r\nThe upper row contains four bones, which enumerating from the inner side\r\nare the _scaphoid_, _lunar_, _pyramidal_ (or cuneiform) and _pisiform_.\r\nThe scaphoid and lunar support the radius, while the ulna rests upon the\r\npyramidal. The pisiform, though very constantly present, is not a true\r\ncarpal, but an ossification in the tendon of one of the flexor muscles,\r\nwhich close the fingers; it projects more or less prominently backward\r\nand articulates with the ulna and pyramidal. The second row is also\r\nmade up of four bones, which, from within outward, are the _trapezium_,\r\n_trapezoid_, _magnum_ and _unciform_. The relations of the two rows\r\nvary much in different mammals and the arrangement may be serial or\r\nalternating; thus, the scaphoid rests upon the trapezium and trapezoid\r\nand usually covers part of the magnum; the lunar may rest upon the magnum\r\nonly, but very much more frequently is equally supported by the magnum\r\nand unciform and the pyramidal by the latter only. The ninth carpal is\r\nthe _central_, which, when present and distinct, is a small bone, wedged\r\nin between the two rows. Few existing mammals have a separate central,\r\nwhich, though present in the embryo, has coalesced with the scaphoid in\r\nthe great majority of forms. In the more advanced and differentiated\r\nmammals the number of carpals may be considerably reduced by the\r\ncoössification of certain elements or the complete suppression and loss\r\nof others. In all existing Carnivora and a few other mammals the scaphoid\r\nand lunar are united in a compound element, the _scapho-lunar_ (or, more\r\naccurately, the scapho-lunar-central); hoofed animals with a diminished\r\nnumber of toes generally lose the trapezium, and other combinations\r\noccur. The second row of carpals carries the metacarpals, and primitively\r\nthe trapezium, trapezoid and magnum are attached each to one metacarpal\r\nand the unciform has two.\r\n\r\nThe metacarpus consists typically of five members, a number which is\r\nnever exceeded in any normal terrestrial mammal; the members are numbered\r\nfrom the inner side, beginning with the thumb or _pollex_, from I to V.\r\nMany mammals have fewer than five metacarpals, which may number four,\r\nthree, two or only one; the third is never lost, but any or all of the\r\nothers may be suppressed, and functionless rudiments of them may long\r\npersist as splints or nodules. The metacarpals are elongate, relatively\r\nslender and of more or less cylindrical shape; but the form varies\r\nconsiderably in different groups, according to the way in which the\r\nhand is used. When employed for grasping, as in many arboreal animals\r\nand pre-eminently in Man, the pollex is frequently opposable to the\r\nother fingers and enjoys much freedom of motion. In the camels and true\r\nruminants the third and fourth metacarpals are coössified to form a\r\n_cannon-bone_ (_see_ Fig. 43, p. 91), but the marrow cavities and the\r\njoints for the phalanges remain separate.\r\n\r\nThe phalanges in land mammals never exceed three in each digit, except\r\nthe pollex, which, when present and fully developed, has but two. The\r\nphalanges are usually slender in proportion to their length, but in very\r\nheavy hoofed animals they are short and massive. The terminal joint is\r\nthe _ungual phalanx_, which carries the nail, claw, or hoof, its shape\r\nvarying accordingly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—Left femur of Wolf, front side. _h._, head.\r\n_gt.tr._, great trochanter. _tr. 2_, second trochanter. _int. con._,\r\ninternal condyle. _r.g._, rotular groove, _ext. con._, external condyle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—Left femur of Horse. _tr. 3_, third trochanter.\r\nOther letters as in Fig. 34, than which this drawing is very much more\r\nreduced.]\r\n\r\nThe hind leg is constituted in very much the same manner as the fore,\r\nbut with certain well-marked and constant differences. The thigh-bone,\r\nor _femur_, is usually the longest and stoutest of the limb-bones and\r\nin very large animals may be extremely massive. At the upper end is the\r\nhemispherical _head_, which is set upon a distinct _neck_ and projects\r\ninward and upward, fitting into the acetabulum of the hip-bone. Nearly\r\nall land mammals have a small pit on the head of the femur, in which is\r\ninserted one end of the _round ligament_, while the other end is attached\r\nin a corresponding depression in the floor of the acetabulum. This\r\nligament helps to hold the thigh-bone firmly in place and yet allows the\r\nnecessary freedom of movement. On the outer side of the upper end of\r\nthe femur is a large, roughened protuberance, which often rises higher\r\nthan the head and is called the _great trochanter_; another, the _second_\r\nor _lesser trochanter_, is a small, more or less conical prominence on\r\nthe inner side of the shaft, below the head. These two processes are\r\nwell-nigh universal among land mammals; and in a few of the orders occurs\r\nthe _third trochanter_, which arises from the outer side of the shaft,\r\nusually at or above the middle of its length. Though comparatively rare\r\nin the modern world, the third trochanter is an important feature, and\r\nthe early members of most, if not all, of the mammalian orders possessed\r\nit. The shaft of the femur is elongate and, except in certain very\r\nbulky mammals, of nearly cylindrical shape. The lower end of the bone\r\nis thick and heavy and bears on the posterior side two large, rounded\r\nprominences, the _condyles_, which articulate with the shin-bone to form\r\nthe knee-joint. On the anterior side is a broad, shallow groove, the\r\n_rotular groove_, in which glides the _patella_, or knee-cap. The patella\r\nis a large ossification, of varying shape, in the tendon common to the\r\nfour great extensor muscles of the thigh, the action of which is to\r\nstraighten the leg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—Left femur of Wolf, inside of lower end. _ext.\r\ncon._, external condyle. _int. con._, internal condyle. _r.g._, rotular\r\ngroove. Above, are two views of the left patella, anterior and internal\r\nsides.]\r\n\r\nThe lower leg, like the fore-arm, has two bones, which, however, are\r\nalways parallel, never crossed, and have no power of rotation. Of these,\r\nthe inner one is the shin-bone, or _tibia_, which is always the larger\r\nand alone enters into the knee-joint. The external bone is the _fibula_,\r\nwhich is almost entirely suppressed in certain highly specialized forms,\r\nsuch as the horses and ruminants, the tibia carrying the whole weight.\r\nThe upper end of the tibia is enlarged and extends over that of the\r\nfibula; it has two slightly concave surfaces for articulation with the\r\ncondyles of the femur, the approximate edges of which are raised into a\r\nbifid _spine_. The upper part of the shaft is triangular, with one edge\r\ndirected forward, and the superior end of this edge is roughened and\r\nthickened to form the _cnemial crest_, to which is attached the patellar\r\nligament. The middle portion of the shaft is rounded and the lower end\r\nbroad and usually divided by a ridge into two grooves or concavities\r\nfor the ankle-bone; from the inner side of this end projects downward\r\na tongue-like process, the _internal malleolus_, which prevents inward\r\ndislocation of the ankle.\r\n\r\nThe fibula is relatively stoutest in the less advanced mammals and is\r\nusually straight and slender, with enlarged ends, the lower one forming\r\nthe _external malleolus_, which serves to prevent outward dislocation\r\nof the ankle. In many forms the fibula is coössified with the tibia at\r\nboth ends, and in the most highly specialized hoofed animals, such as the\r\nhorses, camels and true ruminants, the bone has apparently disappeared.\r\nThe young animal, however, shows that the ends of the fibula have been\r\nretained and the shaft completely lost; the upper end is in the adult\r\nfirmly fused with the tibia and, in the horses, the lower end is also,\r\nbut this remains separate in the ruminants and camels, forming the\r\n_malleolar bone_, which is wedged in between the tibia and the heel-bone.\r\nBecause of its importance in holding the ankle-bone in place, this lower\r\nend of the fibula is never lost in any land mammal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—Bones of left lower leg of Wolf, front side.\r\n_T._, tibia. _F._, fibula. _sp._ spine of tibia. _cn._ cnemial crest.\r\n_i.m._, internal malleolus. _e.m._, external malleolus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—Bones of left lower leg of Horse (much more\r\nreduced). _cn._ cnemial crest. _F._, lower end of fibula, coössified with\r\ntibia.

Note the large size of _Mt. I_,\r\nthe metatarsal of the first digit, or hallux. Letters as in Fig. 40,\r\nexcept _Cb._, cuboid.]\r\n\r\nThe hind foot, or _pes_, like the manus, is clearly divisible into\r\nthree parts, the bones of which are called respectively the _tarsus_,\r\n_metatarsus_ and _phalanges_, and the correspondence in structure between\r\nmanus and pes is close and obvious. The tarsus consists typically of\r\nseven bones, which are tightly packed and rarely permit any movement\r\nbetween them. The upper row of the tarsus consists of two bones, which\r\nare peculiarly modified to form the ankle-joint and heel; on the inner\r\nside is the ankle-bone, or _astragalus_, the shape of which is highly\r\ncharacteristic of the various mammalian orders. The upper or posterior\r\nportion of the astragalus, according to the position of the foot, is a\r\npulley which glides upon the lower end of the tibia and is held firmly in\r\nplace by the internal and the external malleolus. Below the pulley-like\r\nsurface the astragalus usually contracts to a narrow neck, which ends in\r\na flat or convex head. The astragalus is supported behind (or beneath) by\r\nthe heel-bone, or _calcaneum_, which is elongate and extends well above\r\n(or behind) the remainder of the tarsus; it frequently has a distinct\r\narticulation with the fibula, but more commonly is not in contact with\r\nthat bone. The astragalus rests upon the _navicular_, which is moulded\r\nto fit its head and corresponds in position to the central of the carpus,\r\nbut, unlike that carpal, it is a very important element and is never\r\nsuppressed or lost in any land mammal. The navicular, in turn, rests\r\nupon three bones of the second row, which are called respectively the\r\n_internal_, _middle_ and _external cuneiform_, which correspond to the\r\ntrapezium, trapezoid and magnum of the carpus and to which are attached\r\nthe three inner metatarsals, one to each. Finally, the _cuboid_, the\r\nexternal element of the second row, is a large bone, which supports the\r\ncalcaneum and often part of the astragalus and to which the fourth and\r\nfifth metatarsals are attached; it is the equivalent of the unciform\r\nin the manus. The number of tarsals is more constant than that of the\r\ncarpals, but some suppressions and coössifications do occur.\r\n\r\nThe long bones of the pes constitute the metatarsus, which is the\r\ncounterpart of the metacarpus. There are never more than five metatarsals\r\nin any normal mammal, but there may be any number less than five, down\r\nto a single one. In form and size the metatarsals of any given mammal\r\nare usually so like the metacarpals, that it requires some experience\r\nto distinguish them, but when either manus or pes is especially adapted\r\nto some particular kind of work, there may be very decided differences\r\nbetween metatarsals and metacarpals. For example, the burrowing forefoot\r\nof the moles is very different from the hind foot, which has undergone\r\nbut little modification, and even more striking is the difference between\r\nthe wing of a bat and its foot. Many other instances of a less extreme\r\ndivergence might be enumerated, but when manus and pes are used only for\r\nlocomotion, as in nearly all hoofed animals and many other mammals, the\r\nmetacarpals and metatarsals are very similar. When there is a difference\r\nin number, it is the general rule that there are fewer metatarsals; an\r\ninstance of this is found in the tapirs, which have four toes in the\r\nfront foot and three in the hind. Forms which have a cannon-bone in the\r\nmanus have it also in the pes, and some, like the peccaries and the\r\njumping rodents called jerboas, have it only in the pes. The first (or\r\ninner) metatarsal, that of the great toe, or _hallux_, is sometimes\r\nopposable to the others, as in the monkeys, apes and lemurs.\r\n\r\nThe word _metapodial_ is a useful general term which includes both\r\nmetacarpals and metatarsals. A metapodial with its phalanges is a\r\n_digit_, a term often employed because of the ambiguity which arises in\r\nthe use of the words “fingers” and “toes,” and is applicable to both fore\r\nand hind feet.\r\n\r\nNormally, the phalanges of the pes are so like those of the manus as\r\nto require no particular description; and only when the two pairs of\r\nextremities are specialized for entirely different functions, is there\r\nany notable divergence between the phalanges of manus and pes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—Left pes of Black Bear (_Ursus americanus_),\r\nshowing the plantigrade gait. _T._, tibia. _F._, fibula. _Cal._,\r\ncalcaneum. _As._, astragalus. _N._, navicular. _Cn. 3_, external\r\ncuneiform. _Cb._, cuboid. _Mt.

IV_, cannon-bone,\r\nformed by the coössification of the third and fourth metatarsals. _V._,\r\nRudimentary fifth digit.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of the skeleton, it will be well to explain\r\nthe terms used in describing the gait and manner of using the feet.\r\nWhen the entire sole of the foot is in contact with the ground and\r\nweight is thrown upon the heel-bone, or calcaneum, the gait is said to\r\nbe _plantigrade_ and is exemplified in Man, bears, raccoons and many\r\nother mammals. The Dog is _digitigrade_, that is to say, the feet in the\r\nstanding position are nearly erect and the wrist and heel are raised high\r\nabove the ground; the weight is borne upon ball-like pads, one under\r\nthe phalanges of each functional digit and one under the metapodials.\r\nThe digitigrade gait is found not only in all the dogs and cats, but in\r\nmany other Carnivora and in the camels and llamas, as well. Transitions\r\nbetween the plantigrade and digitigrade gait are so numerous and\r\ngradual, that such terms as _semi-plantigrade_ and _semi-digitigrade_\r\nare sometimes necessary. An animal is said to be _unguligrade_ when the\r\nweight is carried entirely upon the hoofs and is used only of hoofed\r\nanimals; examples are the horses, pigs, deer, antelopes, oxen, etc.\r\nThe so-called “knee” of a horse is really his wrist and the “hock” is\r\nthe heel, so that the feet make nearly half the apparent length of the\r\nlegs. Certain very large and massive animals, such as the rhinoceroses\r\nand elephants, are unguligrade in a modified sense; the foot is a\r\nheavy column, seemingly a part of the leg, and the weight is borne\r\nupon a great pad of elastic tissue, with the hoofs disposed around its\r\nperiphery. A very peculiar mode of locomotion is exemplified by certain\r\nof the Edentata, in the forefoot of the existing Ant Bear (_Myrmecophaga\r\njubata_) and in both extremities of some of the later representatives of\r\nthe extinct †ground-sloths, or †Gravigrada. Here the weight is carried\r\nupon the outer edge of the foot, the palm and sole being turned inward.\r\nNo term has been suggested for this very exceptional gait, which is a\r\nmodified form of plantigradism.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE TEETH\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out in Chapter II (p. 38) that very often the teeth are\r\nall that remains to us of extinct genera and species of mammals, and it\r\nmay be further noted that the teeth are very characteristic and often\r\nsuffice to fix the systematic position of a genus. Since, therefore,\r\nthe teeth play such an uncommonly important part as fossils and are so\r\npre-eminently useful to the palæontologist, it is necessary to give some\r\ngeneral account of them.\r\n\r\nAmong the mammals the teeth display a very great variety of size and\r\nform in accordance with the manner in which they are used. Primarily,\r\nthe function of the teeth is to seize and masticate food, and the kind\r\nof food habitually eaten by any animal is well indicated by the form of\r\nits teeth. The beasts of prey have teeth adapted for shearing flesh and\r\ncrushing bones; plant-feeders have teeth fitted for cropping plants and\r\ntriturating vegetable tissues; insect-eaters have teeth with numerous\r\nsharp-pointed cusps, or it may be, no teeth at all, swallowing without\r\nmastication the insects which they capture, etc. Among animals that have\r\nsimilar diet there is very great difference in the form and elaborateness\r\nof the grinding apparatus and it is often possible to follow out the\r\nsteps of evolutionary change, by which, from simple beginnings, a high\r\ndegree of complexity has been attained. In addition to the uses of the\r\nteeth as organs of mastication, they frequently serve as weapons of\r\noffence or defence. In the flesh-eaters which capture living prey they\r\nare formidable offensive weapons, and the fangs of the Lion or the Wolf\r\nare instances familiar to every one; but the tusks of the elephants or\r\nthe hippopotamuses have nothing to do with the taking of prey. Several\r\nOld World deer, which have no antlers or very small ones, possess\r\nscimitar-like upper tusks, with which they are able to defend themselves\r\nvery effectually.\r\n\r\nIn the lower vertebrates, such as reptiles and fishes, the number of\r\nteeth is usually indefinite and they continue to be shed and replaced,\r\nas needed, throughout life; but in each species of mammal, aside from\r\nabnormalities, the number is fixed and constant. Mammalian teeth are very\r\ngenerally divisible into four categories: (1) the _incisors_, or front\r\nteeth, which in the upper jaw are inserted in the premaxillary bones,\r\n(2) the _canines_, or eye-teeth, which are never more than one on each\r\nside of each jaw, or four in all, (3) the _premolars_, called in Man the\r\nbicuspids, the anterior grinding teeth which have predecessors in the\r\nmilk-series and (4) the _molars_, the posterior grinding teeth which have\r\nno such predecessors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—Dentition of Wolf, left side. _i. 3_, third\r\nincisor. _C._, canine. _p. 1_, first premolar. _p. 4_, fourth premolar.\r\n_m. 1_, first molar.]\r\n\r\nIt is customary and convenient to express the numbers and kinds of teeth\r\nof a given mammalian species by means of a “dental formula”; for example,\r\nin Man the formula is: _i_ 2/2, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 2/2, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 32;\r\nthe reason for the multiplication by two is that the figures deal only\r\nwith one side of the mouth and must be doubled to give the sum total.\r\nJust because, however, the two sides are alike, it is usual to take the\r\ndoubling for granted. Written out in full, the formula means that Man has\r\ntwo incisors, one canine, two premolars and three molars on each side of\r\neach jaw, the horizontal line indicating the division between upper and\r\nlower teeth. The number of teeth is frequently not the same in the upper\r\nand lower jaws; for instance, the formula for the Sheep is: _i_ 0/3, _c_\r\n0/1, _p_ 3/3, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 32; the total is the same as in Man, but\r\nthe arrangement is entirely different. The meaning is that in the Sheep\r\nthere are no upper incisors or canines, but three incisors and a canine\r\nare present in each half of the lower jaw, with three premolars and\r\nthree molars on each side above and below. The Dog gives still another\r\nformula: _i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 4/4, _m_ 2/3, × 2 = 42. What is called\r\nthe typical formula for the higher terrestrial mammals above the grade\r\nof the marsupials and which is but rarely exceeded, is _i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1,\r\n_p_ 4/4, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 44, though most existing mammals have fewer teeth\r\nthan this. Compared with the typical formula, the Dog has lost but two\r\nteeth, the third upper molar on each side, while Man and the Sheep have\r\neach lost twelve.\r\n\r\nAs every one knows from his own experience, mammals normally have two\r\nsets of teeth, the first, temporary, or milk-dentition, in the young\r\nanimal, and the second, or permanent dentition, in the adult. The\r\nmilk-dentition, when fully developed, consists of incisors, canines and\r\npremolars, which usually agree in number, though often not in form, with\r\nthe permanent teeth which replace them in the adult. The milk-teeth are\r\nfrequently more conservative than the permanent ones and retain ancestral\r\ncharacters which have disappeared in the adult series, thus affording\r\nwelcome information as to lines of descent and steps of evolutionary\r\nchange. While there can be little doubt that the development of more than\r\none dentition, or set of teeth, is the primitive condition among mammals\r\nand was derived by inheritance from their lower vertebrate ancestors, in\r\nwhich there was an indefinite succession of teeth; yet there are many\r\nmammals in which the milk-dentition is greatly reduced or altogether\r\nlost. In some, the milk-teeth are shed and replaced before birth, in\r\nothers only the germs of the milk-teeth are formed and never cut the gum,\r\nwhile in others again all traces of the temporary series have vanished.\r\nThis complete loss of the milk-teeth, like the presence of a great\r\nnumber of simple and similar teeth in the dolphins and porpoises, or the\r\ntotal absence of teeth, as in the anteaters and whalebone whales, is a\r\nsecondary and derivative condition, never a primitive one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44_A_.—First upper molar, right side of Deer\r\n(_Odocoileus_). On the left, the masticating surface; heavy black\r\nline, enamel. On the right, external side, showing crown and roots.\r\n_Brachyodont._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—First upper molar, left side, of a fossil horse\r\n(_Equus sp._). On the right, external side. On the left, the grinding\r\nsurface, showing two stages of wear. Heavy black line, enamel; white,\r\ndentine; shaded, cement. _Hypsodont_, roots not yet formed.]\r\n\r\nThe structure of mammalian teeth varies greatly, from the simplest\r\nslender cones to enormous and highly complicated apparatus, and, in\r\norder to comprehend the significance of these differences, we must\r\nlook a little more closely into the materials of which the teeth are\r\nconstructed and the manner in which those materials are combined. In\r\nall primitive mammals and in many of the higher and more advanced ones\r\n(including Man) a tooth is composed of the _crown_, or portion which is\r\nexposed above the gum, and the _roots_, one or more in number, by means\r\nof which the tooth is firmly inserted in the jaw-bone; the roots are at\r\nleast partly formed before the tooth comes into use. Such a tooth is said\r\nto be short or low-crowned, or _brachyodont_. In many plant-feeders, such\r\nas horses, cattle, elephants, beavers, etc., the teeth continue to grow\r\nin height for a long time and do not form roots until late in life, or\r\nperhaps not at all. Such teeth are said to be long- or high-crowned, or\r\n_hypsodont_, and in very many instances the development of brachyodont\r\ninto hypsodont teeth may be followed through every step of the change.\r\nThe advantage of the change is obvious in lengthening the animal’s\r\nlife, especially in those which feed upon abrasive substances, like\r\ngrass, for the growth of the teeth long continues to make up for the\r\nloss through wear. Serious trouble has often been caused for captive\r\nelephants by giving them too soft food, so that the growth of the teeth\r\nis not properly balanced by abrasion. Still another category of teeth is\r\nthe _rootless_, which are of simple form, like those of an armadillo,\r\nand grow throughout life, never forming roots. The chisel-like, or\r\n_scalpriform_ incisors of the rodents do not cease to grow while the\r\nanimal lives; they are kept of constant length by continual use, and the\r\narrangement of harder and softer tissue is such that the sharp edge is\r\nmaintained; through accident or malformation it sometimes happens that\r\nthe upper and lower teeth fail to meet, then the continued growth causes\r\nthem to form curved hoops in the mouth, locking the jaws and bringing\r\ndeath by starvation to the unfortunate animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.—Dentition of Beaver (_Castor canadensis_). _m.\r\n3_, last molar. _p. 4_, last premolar. _i._, scalpriform incisors; enamel\r\nface black, dentine in vertical lines.]\r\n\r\nThe typical mammalian tooth is composed of three kinds of tissue,\r\nall differing in structure and hardness and called respectively (1)\r\ndentine, (2) enamel, (3) cement. (1) The _dentine_, or ivory, is the\r\nindispensable tissue of the tooth; the other kinds may be absent, but\r\nnever the dentine. Chemically, it is like bone, but the microscope shows\r\nthat its structure is quite different from that of true bone, being\r\ncomposed of an immense number of fine tubules, which radiate from the\r\n“pulp-cavity,” or chamber which contains the blood-vessels and nerves,\r\nthese entering the tooth through the canals of the roots. The tubules\r\nof the dentine lodge excessively fine fibrillæ of the nerve and that is\r\nwhy the cutting into a live tooth is so painful an operation. (2) The\r\n_enamel_, which is the hardest of all animal tissues, has a polished and\r\nshining appearance and is arranged in a mosaic of microscopic prisms,\r\nclosely packed together, which in most mammals are solid, but in the\r\nmarsupials, with some exceptions, are tubular. The enamel normally covers\r\nthe entire crown of the tooth, but does not extend upon the roots, where\r\nits superior hardness would be of no advantage. In several instances,\r\nalways as a secondary specialization, the enamel does not cover the whole\r\ncrown, but is arranged in vertical bands, it may be on one side only, or\r\nat intervals around the tooth. The scalpriform incisors of the rodents,\r\nalready alluded to, have the enamel band on the front face of the tooth;\r\nthe softer dentine behind wears away more rapidly, keeping the cutting\r\nsurface bevelled, like the edge of a chisel, while the hard enamel forms\r\nthe sharp edge. In some instances the enamel is absent altogether and the\r\nteeth are composed entirely of dentine, as in the elephant tusk. In all\r\nthe Edentata, such as sloths and armadillos, both living and extinct,\r\nthat have any teeth at all, the teeth have no enamel, but in some of the\r\nfossil forms the place of the missing enamel is taken by a harder dentine\r\nand thus the effect of differential hardness is secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—Section through a lower molar of the Indian\r\nElephant (_Elephas maximus_). Enamel, heavy black; dentine, white;\r\ncement, horizontal lines.]\r\n\r\n(3) The _cement_ is simply bone, both chemically and in microscopic\r\nstructure; it is not quite so hard as dentine, but it is less affected by\r\nthe fluids of the mouth and the juices of the food. In the brachyodont\r\nor low-crowned tooth, such as a human molar, the cement merely forms a\r\nsheath over the roots and does not appear upon the crown, but in many\r\nhypsodont teeth, those of horses and elephants, for example, the cement\r\ncompletely encases the entire tooth in a thick layer, filling up all the\r\ndepressions and irregularities of the enamel surface and making a freshly\r\nerupted and unworn tooth look like a shapeless lump. When the cement and\r\nthe enamel covering are partially worn through, the masticating surface\r\nis made up of three distinct substances, each having a different degree\r\nof hardness and thus, through unequal wear, the grinding surface is\r\nalways kept rough and therefore efficient. Not all hypsodont teeth have\r\nthe cement covering, but in such teeth the differing degrees of hardness\r\nof enamel and dentine suffice to keep a rough surface, though not so\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE GEOGRAPHICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAS IN CENOZOIC TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nI. TERTIARY PERIOD\r\n\r\nIn the interior regions of western North America the transition from the\r\nMesozoic to the Cenozoic was so gradual that there is great difficulty\r\nin drawing the line between them and therefore, as might be expected,\r\nthere is much difference of opinion as to just where that line should be\r\ndrawn. From one point of view, the matter is of no great consequence;\r\nbut from another, it is of the utmost importance, for, unless the events\r\nin different continents can be approximately synchronized, it will often\r\nprove a hopeless undertaking to trace the course of migration of the\r\nvarious mammalian groups and determine their place of origin and primary\r\nhome. Until a definitive answer can be given to the question as to when\r\nthe Cenozoic era began, many significant points must be left in doubt,\r\nand much remains to be done in the geology of the Far West before that\r\ndefinitive solution can be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Paleocene Epoch_\r\n\r\nSo far as North America is concerned, the best available evidence points\r\nto the conclusion that we should regard the Fort Union, Puerco and\r\nTorrejon as the most ancient of the Cenozoic formations (see Table, p.\r\n17), though retaining so many features of Mesozoic life that a separate\r\ndivision of the Tertiary, the Paleocene epoch, is made for them. Such\r\na separation is not the common practice in this country, where it is\r\nmore usual to employ the terms “Lowest” or “Basal” Eocene. In my\r\njudgment, however, the balance of advantage is in favour of giving to\r\nthis so-called Basal Eocene a rank equivalent to that of the four other\r\nuniversally recognized and admitted epochs of the Tertiary period. No\r\nmarine rocks of Paleocene date have yet been found in North America,\r\nwhich indicates that the continent was at least as extensive as it is\r\nnow. The very scanty development of deposits representing this epoch\r\nin Europe renders the comparison with the fossils of the Old World\r\nunsatisfactory and hence leads to uncertainty, when it is attempted to\r\ndetermine the land-connections of the time. During the Mesozoic era the\r\nshallow Bering Sea had repeatedly been elevated into a land joining North\r\nAmerica with Asia and had as often been depressed, so as to separate\r\nthe continents and allow the waters of the Arctic Ocean to mingle with\r\nthose of the Pacific. A like alternation of junction and separation went\r\non during the Tertiary and Quaternary periods and, by a comparison of\r\nthe fossil mammals of Europe and America for any particular division of\r\ngeological time, it is almost always feasible to say whether the two\r\ncontinents were connected, or altogether separated. This statement does\r\nnot imply that the proportion of common elements in the two faunas during\r\nepochs of continental connection was a constant one at all times, for\r\nthat was by no means true. Mere land-connections or separations are not\r\nthe only factors which limit the spread of terrestrial animals; if they\r\nwere, the community of forms between North and South America would be\r\nmuch greater than it actually is. Climatic barriers are of almost equal\r\nimportance in determining animal distribution, and changes of climate may\r\ngreatly alter the conditions of migration between connected continents.\r\nAs the connections between North America and the Old World were probably\r\nin high latitudes, where the seas are narrow, changes of climate produced\r\na greater effect upon migration than they could have done had the\r\nland-bridges been in the tropical or warm temperate zones. That these\r\nvicissitudes of climate really did occur and are not mere guesses to\r\nbolster up a tottering hypothesis, there is abundant evidence to prove.\r\n\r\nIn the Paleocene, or most ancient epoch of the Tertiary period, the\r\ngeographical condition of North America was approximately as follows: The\r\ncontinent had attained nearly its modern outlines and on the Atlantic and\r\nPacific coasts probably extended farther seaward than it does to-day.\r\nFlorida, however, and perhaps a narrow strip of the northern Gulf coast\r\nwere still submerged, the Gulf of Mexico opening broadly into the\r\nAtlantic. It is very probable that the continent was connected with the\r\nOld World by a land occupying the site of Bering Sea and perhaps also\r\nby way of Greenland and the North Atlantic; and there is some evidence,\r\nthough not altogether convincing, that it was also joined to South\r\nAmerica. The great mountain ranges were largely what they now are, though\r\nsubsequent upheavals greatly modified the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada\r\nand the ranges of the Pacific coast, while the lofty St. Elias Alps\r\nof Alaska were not in existence. The region of high plateaus, between\r\nthe Rockies and the Sierras, was much less elevated than it is now.\r\nThe Appalachians, which were of far more ancient date than the western\r\nranges, had been worn down by ages of weathering and stream-erosion into\r\na low-lying, almost featureless plain, with some scattered peaks rising\r\nfrom it here and there, of which the mountains of western North Carolina\r\nwere the highest. In general, it may be said that while the _average_\r\nheight of the continent above the sea-level may have been as great or\r\ngreater than at present, yet the inequalities of surface appear to have\r\nbeen less marked, and both along the Atlantic coast and in the interior\r\nwere vast stretches of plains.\r\n\r\nThe Paleocene formations of the western interior are of non-marine or\r\ncontinental origin. In northwestern New Mexico is the typical area\r\nof the _Puerco_ and _Torrejon_, a series of beds 800 to 1000 feet in\r\nthickness and for the most part quite barren of fossils, but there are\r\ntwo horizons, one near the top and the other near the bottom of the\r\nseries, which have yielded a very considerable number of fossil mammals,\r\nand of these the lower is the Puerco, the upper the Torrejon. The _Fort\r\nUnion_ is quite different in character and is composed of great areas\r\nof sandstone and clay rocks, with a maximum thickness of 2000 feet,\r\nin eastern Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana and the adjoining parts of\r\nCanada. The modes of formation of these beds have not yet been fully\r\ndetermined; that they may have been partly laid down in shallow lakes is\r\nindicated by the masses of fresh-water shells in certain localities. In\r\nothers are preserved multitudes of leaves, which have given a very full\r\nconception of the plants of the time, and great swamps and bogs have left\r\nthe traces of their presence in beds of lignite, or imperfectly formed\r\ncoal. Deposits made on the flood-plains of rivers and wind accumulations\r\nare probably also represented. “Vast stretches of subtropical and more\r\nhardy trees were interspersed with swamps where the vegetation was rank\r\nand accumulated rapidly enough to form great beds of lignite. Here were\r\nbogs in which bog iron was formed. Amid the glades of these forests\r\nthere wandered swamp turtles, alligators, and large lizards of the\r\ncharacteristic genus _Champsosaurus_” (Osborn, p. 100).\r\n\r\nFort Union mammals are relatively rare and most of those that have been\r\nfound are very fragmentary; they are amply sufficient, however, to\r\ndemonstrate the Paleocene date of the beds and to make it probable that\r\nthey include both the Puerco and the Torrejon faunas.\r\n\r\nThe climate, as shown by the plants, was much milder and more uniform\r\nthan that of the Recent epoch, though some indication of climatic zones\r\nmay already be noted. The vegetation was essentially modern in character;\r\nnearly all our modern types of forest-trees, such as willows, poplars,\r\nsycamores, oaks, elms, maples, walnuts and many others, were abundantly\r\nrepresented in the vast forests which would seem to have covered nearly\r\nthe entire continent from ocean to ocean and extended north into Alaska\r\nand Greenland, where no such vegetation is possible under present\r\nconditions. Numerous conifers were mingled with the deciduous trees,\r\nbut we do not find exclusively coniferous forests. Palms, though not\r\nextending into Greenland, flourished magnificently far to the north of\r\ntheir present range. On the other hand, the Paleocene flora of England\r\npoints to a merely temperate climate, while that of the succeeding Eocene\r\nwas subtropical.\r\n\r\n_South America._—Nothing is definitely known concerning the condition of\r\nCentral America and the West Indies and very little as to South America.\r\nAs no marine rocks of Paleocene date have been found in any of these\r\nregions, it may be inferred that all the existing land areas were then\r\nabove the sea, and there is some evidence that South America was much\r\nmore extended in certain directions than now. From the character and\r\ndistribution of modern plants, fresh-water fishes, land and fresh-water\r\nshells, there is strong reason to believe that in late Mesozoic times a\r\nland-bridge connected Brazil with equatorial Africa and this connection\r\nmay have continued into the Paleocene, though it is only fair to observe\r\nthat some highly competent authorities deny the reality of this bridge.\r\nThere is also evidence, though incomplete, of a connection between South\r\nAmerica and Australia by way of the Antarctic continent, and it is\r\nclear that that polar region could not have had the rigorous climate of\r\nthe present time. In the upper part of the Cretaceous, the last of the\r\nMesozoic periods, there was a possibility of migration, however indirect,\r\nbetween every continent and every other, for the huge land reptiles\r\ncalled Dinosaurs have been found in the non-marine Cretaceous rocks of\r\nevery continent, which could not have been the case, had any of the great\r\nland areas been isolated. There is no known reason to assume that the\r\nland-bridges were essentially different in the Paleocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Eocene Epoch_\r\n\r\n_North America._—The Eocene witnessed quite extensive geographical\r\nchanges, though but little is known of it in Central or South America, or\r\nthe West Indies. Along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States\r\nthere was an extensive submergence of the coastal plain, the sea covering\r\nthe southern half of New Jersey and extending thence to the southwestward\r\nin an ever broadening band, through the South Atlantic and Gulf states.\r\nNorthern Florida was under water and the Gulf extended as a narrow sound,\r\nknown as the “Mississippi Embayment,” up the valley of that river to\r\nsouthern Illinois and westward into Texas. The Embayment was present\r\nin the Cretaceous and again in the Eocene, but it is not known whether\r\nit persisted through the Paleocene; probably it did not, as the whole\r\nAtlantic coast region appears to have stood at a higher level then than\r\nnow. While the condition of Mexico and Central America during the Eocene\r\nis not known in any save the vaguest manner, it is evident that there\r\nwas then a broad communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific,\r\ncompletely severing North and South America, though the place of this\r\ntransverse sea has not been fixed. On the Pacific side, a long, narrow\r\narm of the sea occupied what is now the great valley of California,\r\nextending north into Oregon and Washington. It will be noted that in\r\nNorth America the Eocene sea was almost confined to the neighbourhood of\r\nthe present coast-lines, nowhere penetrating very far inland, except in\r\nthe Mississippi Embayment, and thus differing widely from the condition\r\nof Europe at that epoch, where much of what is now land was submerged.\r\nThe greatly expanded Mediterranean covered most of southern Europe, where\r\nthe great mountain ranges, the Pyrenees, Alps, etc., had not yet been\r\nformed. Very important, from the point of view of American geography,\r\nis the fact that Europe was completely separated from Asia by a narrow\r\nstrait or sea, which ran down the eastern side of the Ural Mountains\r\nfrom the Arctic Ocean and joined the enlarged Mediterranean. During the\r\nexistence of this Ural Sea any land connection of North America with\r\nEurope must necessarily have been by means of a North Atlantic bridge,\r\nor by one across the Arctic Sea, since communication with Asia by way of\r\nAlaska would not have reached eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—Map of North America during the Eocene epoch.\r\nThe present limits of the continent are shown in outline; white areas =\r\nland; horizontal lines = sea; dotted areas = non-marine deposits; black\r\ncircles with white dots = active volcanoes. (After Schuchert.)]\r\n\r\nAny such general statement of geographical conditions during the Eocene\r\nas the foregoing sketch, cannot but be to some extent misleading, because\r\nit brings together, as contemporary, arrangements which were, in some\r\ncases at least, separated by considerable intervals of time and which\r\nwere subject to continual change. Along nearly all coasts the position of\r\nthe sea was quite different in the latter part of the epoch from what it\r\nhad been in the earlier portion. On the north side of the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nfor example, the sea retreated from time to time, and the successive\r\ndivisions of the Eocene rocks are so arranged that the later ones are\r\nfarther to the south. Limitations of space, however, forbid the attempt\r\nto follow out these minor changes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—Bad Lands of the lower Eocene. Wasatch stage.\r\nBig Horn Basin, Wyo. (Photograph by Sinclair.)]\r\n\r\nIn the western interior are found extensive non-marine or continental\r\ndeposits of Eocene date, which must be considered more in detail, because\r\nof the highly important bearing which they have upon mammalian history.\r\nWith the exception of a few small areas in Colorado, these deposits are\r\nall situated in the plateau region west of the Rocky Mountains, and were\r\nmade of the débris of older rocks washed down by rain and rivers and\r\ndeposited in broad basins. Some of them are the sediments of shallow or\r\ntemporary lakes, and one series, at least, is made up of volcanic ash and\r\ndust showered upon the land, or into water of no great depth. The oldest\r\nof these Eocene stages, known as the _Wasatch_ (see Table, p. 17) covers\r\na very large region, though in a discontinuous manner; the principal area\r\nbegins in New Mexico, where it lies over the Torrejon, of the Paleocene,\r\nand extends far to the north through western Colorado and eastern Utah\r\nto the Uinta Mountains, around the eastern end of which it passes in a\r\nnarrow band and then expands again over southwestern Wyoming. A second\r\narea is in the Big Horn Basin of northwestern Wyoming and southern\r\nMontana, and probably two small areas in southern Colorado are of the\r\nsame date. The Wasatch beds are richly fossiliferous and have yielded a\r\nmost interesting and important series of mammals, which were far more\r\nadvanced than those of the Paleocene; and, at first sight, the student\r\nis tempted to believe that they must be of very much later date. A more\r\ncritical examination shows that this appearance of a great lapse of time\r\nbetween the Paleocene and the Wasatch is deceptive; the more advanced and\r\ncharacteristic of the Wasatch mammals were obviously not the descendants\r\nof ancestors in the North American Paleocene, but were altogether\r\nnewcomers to this continent, immigrants from some region which cannot\r\nyet be identified. On the other hand, a considerable number of the old,\r\nindigenous types still persisted, and these, when compared with their\r\nPaleocene ancestors, are found not to have changed so much as to require\r\na very great length of time, geologically speaking, for the degree of\r\ndevelopment involved. This is the earliest recorded one of the great\r\nwaves of mammalian migration which invaded North America down almost to\r\nour own time.\r\n\r\nThe same wave of migration extended to Europe, and that there was a broad\r\nand easy way of communication between that continent and North America\r\nis plain, for the similarity between the Wasatch mammals and those of\r\nthe corresponding formation in France, the _Sparnacian_, is remarkably\r\nclose. At no subsequent time were the mammalian faunas of North America\r\nand Europe so nearly identical as during the Wasatch-Sparnacian age,\r\nwhich is especially remarkable when the discrepancy is noted between the\r\nvast stretches of the Wasatch (150,000 square miles) and the very limited\r\nareas in France.\r\n\r\nIf, as is probable, the Ural Sea was in existence at that time, the\r\nland-connection with Europe must have been across the North Atlantic,\r\nmost likely from Greenland eastward. At the present time a land-bridge\r\nin such high latitudes would be of little service in bringing about a\r\nsimilarity of mammals in the two continents, for the severity of the\r\nArctic climate would be as effective a barrier against the intermigration\r\nof all save the Arctic mammals as the ocean itself; but in the mild and\r\ngenial Eocene climate the latitude of the bridge was of small consequence.\r\n\r\nThe second of the Eocene stages, the _Wind River—Green River_, is found\r\nin two very different phases. The Wind River phase occupies the basin\r\nof that stream, north of the Wind River Mountains in central Wyoming,\r\nand in the Big Horn Basin of the same state it very extensively overlies\r\nthe Wasatch, and in this phase the sediments are very like those of the\r\nlatter, flood-plain and wind accumulations. A widely distant area of\r\nthis stage occurs in the Huerfano Cañon in Colorado. The Wind River beds\r\ncontain numerous mammals which were clearly sequential to those of the\r\nWasatch, of which they were the more or less modified descendants. With\r\ntwo possible exceptions, there were no new immigrants and the connection\r\nwith the Old World may have been already severed, as it assuredly was in\r\nthe succeeding age, the Bridger, though divergent development had not yet\r\nhad time to produce the very striking differences in the mammals of North\r\nAmerica from those of Europe, which characterized the Bridger.\r\n\r\nThe Green River phase is a thick body of finely laminated “paper shales,”\r\nwhich seem to have been deposited in a very shallow lake and occupy\r\nsome 5000 square miles of the Green River valley in southern Wyoming\r\nand northern Utah, where they overlie the Wasatch, just as do the Wind\r\nRiver beds in the Big Horn Basin. These fine-grained and thinly laminated\r\nshales have preserved, often in beautiful perfection, countless remains\r\nof plants, insects and fishes, but no traces of mammals, other than\r\nfootprints, have been found.\r\n\r\nThe third of the Eocene stages of the interior is the _Bridger_ of\r\nsouthern Wyoming and northeastern Utah, where it lies upon the Green\r\nRiver shales, but overlaps these shales both eastward and westward,\r\nextending out upon the Wasatch. The Bridger beds are largely made up\r\nof volcanic ash and dust deposited partly upon the land and partly in\r\nshallow or temporary lakes. The frequency with which the remains of\r\nfishes, crocodiles and fresh-water shells are found indicates deposition\r\nin water, and the large crystals of gypsum which are abundant in certain\r\nlocalities show that the water became salt, at least occasionally. From\r\nthe immense mass of volcanic débris, it is evident that volcanic activity\r\nbroke out at this time on a much greater scale than had been known in\r\nthat region since the Cretaceous period. Two different horizons, or\r\nsubstages, are distinguishable in the Bridger, lower and upper, each of\r\nwhich has its distinct mammalian fauna, though the two are very closely\r\nallied. Their difference from the contemporary mammals of Europe is very\r\ngreat, hardly any genera being common to the two continents. So striking\r\na difference indubitably points to a severance of the land-connection,\r\na severance which, as was shown above, probably took place during the\r\nWind River stage, for its effects would not be immediately apparent; time\r\nwould be required for the operation of divergent evolution, the fauna of\r\neach continent developing along its own lines, to make itself so strongly\r\nfelt. Had the connection never been renewed, North America, on the one\r\nhand, and Eurasia on the other, would to-day be utterly different from\r\nthe zoölogical point of view, instead of containing, as they do, a great\r\nmany identical or closely similar animals of all classes, a likeness due\r\nto subsequent migrations.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last of the stages referred to the Eocene is the _Uinta_,\r\nthe geological position of which is the subject of much debate; almost\r\nas good reasons can be brought forward for placing it in the Oligocene\r\nas in the Eocene, so nearly is it on the boundary line between those two\r\nepochs. The Uinta is found in the Green River valley of northeastern\r\nUtah and northwestern Colorado, where it lies upon the upper Bridger\r\nand is the latest of the important Tertiary formations to be found in\r\nthe plateau region west of the Rocky Mountains. It is probable that the\r\nseparation of North America from the Old World still continued, for, as a\r\nwhole, the Uinta fauna is totally different from that of the upper Eocene\r\nof Europe. There were, however, a few doubtful forms, which may prove to\r\nbe the outposts of a renewed invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Eocene climate was decidedly warmer than the present one, and\r\nsubtropical conditions extended over the whole United States and perhaps\r\nfar into Canada. On the other hand, signs of increasing aridity in\r\nthe western part of the continent are not wanting, and that must have\r\nresulted in a great shrinkage of the forests and increase of the open\r\nplains. The vegetation was essentially the same as in the Paleocene, when\r\nit had already attained a modern character, the differences from the\r\npresent being chiefly in regard to geographical distribution. Large palms\r\nwere then flourishing in Wyoming and Idaho, and another indication of a\r\nwarm climate is furnished by the large crocodiles which abounded in all\r\nof the Eocene stages.\r\n\r\nSo far as North America was concerned, the Eocene epoch was brought to\r\na close by extensive movements of the earth’s crust, which more or less\r\naffected the entire continent and were registered both on the sea-coasts\r\nand in the mountain ranges of the interior. Upheaval added a narrow belt\r\nof land along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and the Mississippi Embayment\r\nwas nearly closed. On the Pacific side the sea withdrew from the great\r\nvalley of California and Oregon, and in the interior the plateau region\r\nwas elevated by a great disturbance, which also increased the height of\r\nthe western mountains.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of Eocene land-mammals in North America is almost wholly\r\nderived from the formations of the western United States, but it may\r\nbe inferred from the uniform climatic conditions that there were no\r\nvery great geographical differences among the animals. This inference\r\nis confirmed by the discovery of a Bridger genus, very fragmentary but\r\nidentifiable, in the marine Eocene of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n_South America._—No Eocene rocks, marine or continental, are known in\r\nthe West Indies or Central America, but the latter region has been so\r\nimperfectly explored that no great importance can be attached to this\r\nfact. North and South America were separated completely, as is proved by\r\nthe entire dissimilarity of their mammalian faunas, but the position of\r\nthe transverse sea or strait cannot be determined. There is much reason\r\nto believe that the Greater Antilles were connected into a single large\r\nland, which has been called “Antillia” and may have been joined to the\r\nmainland of Central America. Certain marine rocks in Patagonia and Chili\r\nhave been referred to the Eocene by South American geologists, but the\r\nreference is almost certainly erroneous, the rocks in question being\r\nmuch more probably Miocene. The Andes, probably throughout their length\r\nand certainly in their southern half, stood at a much lower level than\r\nthey do now, and, no doubt, were rising, either slowly and steadily, or\r\nperiodically and more rapidly, throughout the whole Tertiary period. At\r\nall events, their present height in the south is due to movements in\r\nthe Pliocene or later. Continental deposits of Eocene date have been\r\ndiscovered only in northern Patagonia (Casa Mayor) where they occupy\r\ndepressions in the worn and eroded surfaces of the Cretaceous rocks; the\r\nmode of their formation has not been carefully studied.\r\n\r\nThere is great uncertainty as to the status of the land-bridge which,\r\nit is believed, in the Cretaceous period connected South America with\r\nAfrica. Some of the evidence goes to show that the connection persisted\r\nthroughout the Eocene epoch, but the testimony is that of fragmentary\r\nand therefore imperfectly understood fossils and is far from being\r\nunequivocal. The connection with Antarctica probably continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Oligocene Epoch_\r\n\r\n_North America._—The Oligocene, or third of the Tertiary epochs, was a\r\ntime of great significance in the history of the American mammals and\r\nof great geographical changes in the West Indian and Central American\r\nregions, but in North America proper the changes were not so widespread.\r\nOn the Atlantic coast the marine Oligocene is but scantily displayed\r\nexcept in the Florida peninsula, where it is found in a thickness of some\r\n2000 feet, but it is well developed along the north shore of the Gulf of\r\nMexico, where the coast-line followed that of the Eocene, only a little\r\nfarther to the south, marking the retreat of the sea at the end of the\r\nEocene. The Gulf Stream entered the Atlantic over the site of northern\r\nFlorida and flowed northward nearer the coast than it does to-day, in\r\nconsequence of which warm-water conditions extended far to the north and\r\nWest Indian shells flourished on the New Jersey coast. In the middle\r\nOligocene part of northern Florida was elevated into an island and the\r\nwater over much of the remainder of the peninsula became shallower, but\r\nthis did not greatly alter the course of the Gulf Stream. The Pacific\r\nencroached upon the western shore of Oregon and British Columbia and very\r\nextensively upon that of Alaska, where strata no less than 10,000 feet\r\nthick are assigned to this epoch.\r\n\r\nIn the western interior Oligocene formations are among the most important\r\nand widely spread of the continental Tertiaries and are divisible into\r\ntwo principal stages and each of these again into three substages.\r\nOf these, the older or _White River_ stage covers a vast region in\r\nnortheastern Colorado, western Nebraska, eastern Wyoming and southern\r\nSouth Dakota, with separate areas in the Black Hills, North Dakota and\r\nthe Northwest Territory of Canada. The deposits are believed to be\r\nchiefly of fluviatile origin, and many of the ancient stream-channels,\r\nsome of great size, may still be traced, filled with the consolidated\r\nsands and gravels of the old rivers. The country was very flat and the\r\ndivides between the streams very low, so that in seasons of flood great\r\nregions were converted into shallow, temporary lakes, in which were\r\ndeposited the finer silt and mud, but were dry for most of the year. The\r\nvolcanic activity which had gone on so impressively in the Bridger Eocene\r\nwas renewed in White River times, as is proved by thick beds of pure\r\nvolcanic ash, which must have been carried long distances by the wind,\r\nfor they occur far from any volcanic vent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—Map of North America in the upper Oligocene.\r\nExplanation as in Fig. 48. (After Schuchert.)]\r\n\r\nThe White River fauna is more completely known than that of any other\r\nTertiary formation of this continent. The first discovery of these\r\nfossils was made more than 70 years ago and since then oft-repeated\r\nexpeditions have brought to light an astonishing number and variety of\r\nmammals. Not only are these beds remarkable for the immense quantity\r\nof material which they have yielded, but also for its completeness and\r\nbeauty of preservation, a most unusual number of skeletons having been\r\nobtained. The mammals demonstrate that the land-connection with the Old\r\nWorld had been re-established, for many European genera, which could not\r\nhave been derived from an American ancestry, are found in the White River\r\nbeds. At the same time, there was no such proportion of forms common to\r\nboth continents as there had been in the Wasatch-Sparnacian stage of\r\nthe lower Eocene, each having many genera and even families which did\r\nnot extend their range into the other. The reason for this remarkable\r\nand, at first sight, inexplicable difference between the lower Eocene\r\nand the lower Oligocene is probably to be found in climatic changes, in\r\nconsequence of which relatively fewer genera were able to take advantage\r\nof the reopened connection, which lay far to the north. The White River\r\nmammals, like those of the Recent epoch, are thus divisible into two\r\ngroups or elements, one set indigenous and descended from ancestors\r\nwhich are found in the American Eocene, and the other composed of late\r\nimmigrants from the Old World. Migrants from North America likewise made\r\ntheir way to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe upper continental Oligocene of the interior has received the peculiar\r\nappellation of the _John Day_, from the river of that name in eastern\r\nOregon, a large part of which was buried to a depth of 3000 or 4000 feet\r\nin stratified volcanic ash and tuff. This great mass of finely divided\r\nvolcanic material was derived from the craters of the Cascade Mountains\r\nto the westward; a long-continued series of eruptions would be needed\r\nto form such thick accumulations at such a distance from the sources of\r\nsupply. The John Day evidently succeeded the White River very closely\r\nin time, but is marked by the disappearance of almost all the European\r\nmigrants. This fact, together with the absence of any new immigrant\r\ngenera, is evidence that the connection had again been broken and it was\r\nnot renewed until after a considerable lapse of time.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for believing that the Oligocene climate marked\r\nthe beginning of the very long and gradual process of refrigeration\r\nwhich culminated in the glacial conditions of the Pleistocene epoch, but\r\nthe change was slight and probably chiefly affected the far north. The\r\nclimate, however, remained notably warmer than the present one of the\r\nsame extra-tropical latitudes, as is abundantly proved by the fossils.\r\nThe Atlantic coast, as noted above, was bathed in warm waters, the plants\r\nof the Alaskan Oligocene point to temperate conditions and the vegetation\r\nof Europe was subtropical, palms growing in the north of Germany. The\r\nchange which was distinctly to be noted in the Great Plains region of\r\nNorth America was probably due rather to the elevation and increased\r\naltitude of the western interior than to general climatic alteration.\r\nCrocodiles are very rare indeed in the White River beds and those that\r\nhave been found all belong to dwarf species, while none are known from\r\nthe John Day. Unfortunately, hardly anything has been ascertained\r\nconcerning the Oligocene vegetation of the region, but the reptiles\r\nindicate diminished warmth.\r\n\r\n_South America._—Marine Oligocene strata have great extent around the\r\nGulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and the distribution of these shows\r\nthat Antillia was broken up by great submergences, the islands of the\r\nGreater Antilles being much smaller than they are to-day. The greater\r\npart of Central America and the Isthmus were under water, a broad sea,\r\nbroken only by scattered islands, separating North and South America.\r\nVery little is known of the Oligocene in the latter continent save a\r\nnon-marine formation in northern Patagonia, the _Deseado_ stage (or\r\nPyrotherium Beds), which, like the Eocene of the same region, occupies\r\ndepressions in the worn and irregular surface of the Cretaceous rocks.\r\nThe attribution of the Deseado to the Oligocene is open to some doubt,\r\nbecause of the entire absence in its mammalian fauna of any elements\r\nwhich are also found in the northern hemisphere. Hence, there are no\r\nmeans of direct comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Miocene Epoch_\r\n\r\n_North America._—The Atlantic and Gulf coasts, which had been raised\r\nin the Oligocene, were again depressed, almost restoring the Eocene\r\ncoast-line, the chief differences being the presence of the Florida\r\nislands and the nearly complete closing of the Mississippi Embayment.\r\nThere was a remarkable change in the marine fauna from that of Oligocene\r\ntimes; a cool current flowed southward along the coast and entered the\r\nGulf of Mexico through the strait between the Florida island and the\r\nmainland, bringing the northern animals with it and driving out the\r\ntropical forms. This complete faunal change, which might fairly be called\r\na revolution, was the most sudden and striking in the Tertiary history of\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific coast also there was a depression, which caused a renewed\r\ntransgression of the sea. The Coast Range formed a chain of reefs and\r\nislands in the Miocene sea, which again filled the great valley of\r\nCalifornia, except in the northern part of what is now the Sacramento\r\nValley, where there was an accumulation of continental deposits. The\r\nimmense thickness (5000 to 7000 feet) of the California Miocene is\r\nlargely made up of volcanic material, which testifies to the great\r\nactivity of the vents. In the Sierras, the height of which was increased\r\nin the upper Miocene, there was also a great display of vulcanism,\r\nrecorded in the lava-flows and tuffs of the time. In the region of\r\nLower California and northwestern Mexico considerable changes of the\r\ncoast-line took place during the Miocene; in the earlier half of the\r\nepoch the Gulf of California was much shorter and narrower than it is\r\nto-day and the peninsula was broadly united with the mainland to the east\r\nas well as to the north. A wide submergence marked the upper Miocene,\r\nreducing the peninsula to a long, narrow island and enlarging the gulf\r\nconsiderably beyond its present limits, flooding an extensive area in\r\nnorthwestern Mexico and sending a small bay into southeastern California.\r\nThere were great disturbances in the course of the epoch, for in the\r\nSanta Cruz Mountains near San Francisco the lower Miocene strata were\r\ncrumpled into folds, before those of the upper Miocene were deposited\r\nupon them. British Columbia, Washington and Oregon were invaded by the\r\nsea, which extended up the valley of the Columbia River and its southern\r\ntributary, the Willamette, though here the beds are far thinner than\r\nthose of California. Much of Alaska, both on the north and west coasts\r\nand in the valley of the Yukon, was submerged, and the land-connection\r\nwith Asia appears to have been broken. This is made probable not only\r\nby the submergence of the Alaskan coast, but also by the fact that the\r\nmarine animals of the California coasts and shoal waters, which could\r\nnot migrate across the ocean, were quite unlike the contemporary forms\r\nof the eastern Asiatic shore, which would hardly have been the case, had\r\na continuous coast-line united the two continents. On the other hand,\r\nthere was a renewed connection with Europe, as is shown by the appearance\r\nof Old World land-mammals, beginning scantily in the lower and becoming\r\nnumerous in the middle Miocene. This connection, it will be remembered,\r\nhad been interrupted during the upper Oligocene. Many students of the\r\nproblem have maintained that the land-bridge was by way of the West\r\nIndies and the Mediterranean lands, but such a bridge would not account\r\nfor the facts of mammalian distribution, which would seem to require its\r\nlocation in the far north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—Map of North America in the upper Miocene.\r\nExplanation as in Fig. 48. (Modified from Schuchert.)]\r\n\r\nSeveral distinct lines of evidence go to prove that the junction of\r\nthe Americas dates from the Miocene, possibly from the beginning of\r\nit. The absence of Atlantic species from the Pacific Miocene is an\r\nindication that the passage from ocean to ocean had been closed, and\r\nthis is confirmed by the geology of the Central American and Isthmian\r\nregion. In the middle Miocene of Oregon and Nebraska have been found\r\nremains, which are unfortunately too incomplete for altogether convincing\r\nidentification, but which can be interpreted only as belonging to the\r\nextinct and most characteristically South American group of edentates,\r\nthe †ground-sloths or †Gravigrada; if this reference is correct, the fact\r\nof the junction cannot be questioned.\r\n\r\nContinental deposits of Miocene date, chiefly accumulations made by\r\nrivers and the wind, cover vast areas of the western interior, though but\r\nrarely to any considerable depth. These have been divided into several\r\nstages and have received various names; the lower Miocene, known as the\r\n_Arikaree_, _Harrison_ or _Rosebud_, overlies the White River in South\r\nDakota, western Nebraska and eastern Wyoming, with smaller areas in\r\nMontana and Colorado. In the deposits of this stage there are no mammals\r\nof indisputably Old World type, though a few which I consider to be such\r\nare a probable indication of renewed connection with Europe. The middle\r\nMiocene is found typically in central Montana, where it is called the\r\n_Deep River_ (or _Smith River_) stage, but occurs also in numerous small,\r\nscattered and widely separated areas in Oregon, Wyoming, Colorado and\r\nTexas, with local names in these different states. It is most likely\r\nthat these middle Miocene formations are not strictly contemporaneous in\r\nthe geological sense, but rather form a closely connected and successive\r\nseries. The mammals of the Deep River stage leave no doubt that the way\r\nof migration from the Old World was again open.\r\n\r\nThe _Loup Fork_, or upper Miocene, itself susceptible of further\r\nsubdivision, is by far the most extensive of the Miocene formations and\r\ncovers much of the Great Plains region, in separate areas, from South\r\nDakota far into Mexico. Perhaps also referable to the upper Miocene is\r\na small, but very interesting formation, the _Florissant_, which is in\r\nthe South Park of Colorado; it was made by very fine volcanic material\r\nshowered into a small and shallow lake. The finely laminated papery\r\nshales of the Florissant have preserved countless plants and insects\r\nand many fishes, and these throw very welcome light upon the vegetation\r\nand climatic conditions of the epoch and afford an interesting contrast\r\nto the fauna and flora of the Green River shales of the lower or middle\r\nEocene. That the Florissant shales are Miocene, no one questions, but\r\ntheir isolated position and the fact that they have yielded no mammals\r\nmake it somewhat doubtful whether they belong in the middle or later part\r\nof the epoch.\r\n\r\nIn the western portion of the continent vulcanism was displayed on a\r\ngrand scale during the Miocene. Mention has already been made of the\r\nquantity of volcanic material in the marine Miocene of California and\r\nalso in the lavas and tuffs of the Sierras. The magnificent cones,\r\nsuch as Mts. Hood and Tacoma, which are the glory of the Cascades,\r\nare believed to date from this time. In Idaho and eastern Oregon and\r\nWashington are the immense lava-fields of the Columbia River, which are,\r\npartly at least, of Miocene date and were chiefly extruded through great\r\nfissures, the lava flooding the valleys and plains in a fiery sea of\r\nmolten rock. In Oregon these lavas rest upon the upper Oligocene (John\r\nDay stage) and middle Miocene beds are deposited upon them, which fixes\r\ntheir date sufficiently. In the Yellowstone Park was piled up a huge mass\r\nof volcanic products, lava-flows and beds of ash and tuff, to a thickness\r\nof several thousand feet. The ash-beds have preserved the petrified\r\nforests, with their tree-trunks still standing one above another; one\r\nlocality in the Park shows seven such forests, each one killed and buried\r\nby a great discharge of ash and then a new forest established and growing\r\nupon the surface of the accumulation. In the tuffs are leaf-impressions\r\nwhich permit identification of the plants.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the Miocene and at its close there were important\r\ncrustal movements, which affected all the Pacific coast mountain ranges,\r\nthough this epoch was no such time of mountain making in America as it\r\nwas in the Old World. The principal elevation of the Coast Range in\r\nCalifornia and Oregon was due to these movements, and the Sierras and the\r\nplateaus of Utah and Arizona were increased in height. On the Atlantic\r\nside the Florida island was joined to the mainland and thus the present\r\nshape of the continent was almost exactly gained.\r\n\r\nThe Miocene climate of North America, as indicated by the plants of\r\nFlorissant, the Yellowstone Park and Oregon, was distinctly milder than\r\nat present, a southern vegetation of warm-temperate character extending\r\nto Montana and perhaps much farther north, but it was not so warm as it\r\nhad been in the Eocene, and palms are not found in any of the localities\r\nmentioned, nor do crocodiles occur in any of the northern Miocene\r\nformations. In Europe the climate of the early Miocene was considerably\r\nwarmer than in North America, the vegetation of central and western\r\nEurope being very much like that of modern India. This difference between\r\nthe two sides of the Atlantic was probably due, in large part, to the\r\nmanner in which Europe was broken and intersected by arms and gulfs of\r\nthe warm southern sea. In the latter half of the epoch, however, the\r\nclimate became colder, the subtropical flora giving way to a distinctly\r\ntemperate one.\r\n\r\n_South America._—In Central America, where marine Oligocene beds are\r\nof great extent, no Miocene is known, and on the Isthmus Oligocene is\r\nthe latest marine formation, except a narrow fringe of Pleistocene\r\non the Caribbean coast. These facts and others already cited lead to\r\nthe conclusion that in the Miocene the connection of the Americas was\r\ncomplete and that the Isthmus was considerably broader than at present,\r\nextending nearly to Jamaica. The condition of the Greater Antilles is but\r\nvaguely understood, but they were involved in the general elevation of\r\nthe Caribbean region and were at least as large as they are now and may\r\nhave been considerably larger, and Cuba was perhaps joined to Central\r\nAmerica, as Hayti probably was.\r\n\r\nIn South America proper nearly the whole of Patagonia was submerged\r\nby the transgression of a shallow, epicontinental sea, in which were\r\naccumulated the beds of the _Patagonian_ stage, containing an exceedingly\r\nrich and varied assemblage of marine fossils, an assemblage which has\r\nvery little in common with the contemporary formations of the northern\r\nhemisphere. It is this lack of elements common to the northern faunas\r\nwhich has led to the long debate concerning the geological date of the\r\nPatagonian formation, the South American geologists very generally\r\nreferring it to the Eocene. However, the occurrence of genera of\r\nCetaceans (whales and dolphins), which are also found in the Miocene\r\nof Maryland and Virginia, is very strong evidence that the proper date\r\nof the Patagonian is Miocene. A continuous coast-line, or at least an\r\nunbroken continuity of shoal-water conditions, seems necessary to account\r\nfor the similarity of the Patagonian fossils with those of New Zealand\r\nand Australia, and that this connection was by way of the Antarctic\r\ncontinent is indicated by the occurrence of similar fossils in the South\r\nShetland Islands, an Antarctic group. On the Chilian coast the _Navidad_\r\nformation, which is believed to be approximately contemporaneous with\r\nthe Patagonian, has so different a fauna as to point to some kind of a\r\nbarrier between the Atlantic and the Pacific, and this barrier, Dr. von\r\nIhering holds, was the land-extension from South America to Antarctica.\r\n\r\nAfter some oscillations of retreat and advance, the sea withdrew from\r\nPatagonia and the terrestrial accumulations of the _Santa Cruz_ stage\r\nwere formed. These beds are partly composed of river-deposits, but\r\nchiefly of more or less consolidated volcanic ash or tuff, and have\r\nyielded a surprising number of beautifully preserved mammals. No other\r\nassemblage of South American Tertiary Mammalia is so well known and\r\nunderstood as the Santa Cruz fauna, and the very large number of all but\r\ncomplete skeletons which have been found strongly suggests that many of\r\nthe animals were buried alive in the showers of volcanic ash. The Santa\r\nCruz fauna is completely and radically different from any of the North\r\nAmerican assemblages, and at that time no immigrant from the north had\r\npenetrated so far as Patagonia.\r\n\r\nIn the upper Miocene the Andes stood at a much lower level than they\r\ndo now; fossil plants, some of them collected at a great height in the\r\nmountains, are the remains of a luxuriant and purely tropical flora\r\nnearly identical with the vegetation of the modern forests of Bolivia\r\nand Brazil. Such a vegetation could not exist at the altitudes where the\r\nfossils occur and these demonstrate a great elevation of the mountains\r\nsince those leaves were embedded. The same mild climatic conditions which\r\nprevailed in the northern hemisphere during the Miocene must also have\r\ncharacterized Patagonia, subtropical shells extending far to the south of\r\ntheir present range.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been true of the land-bridge connecting South America\r\nwith Africa during the early Tertiary epochs, it must have been\r\nsubmerged in the Miocene, otherwise there would not have been the open\r\npathway for the Cetacea of Patagonia to reach the Atlantic coast of North\r\nAmerica and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Pliocene Epoch_\r\n\r\n_North America._—The Pliocene of North America is not nearly so well\r\ndisplayed or so satisfactorily known as the preceding Tertiary epochs,\r\nand only of comparatively late years has it been recognized at all upon\r\nthe Atlantic coast. The Atlantic and Gulf shores had very nearly their\r\npresent outlines, but with some notable differences. It would seem that\r\nthe northeastern portion of the continent stood at a higher level than\r\nit does now, north Greenland being joined with the islands of the Arctic\r\narchipelago and Newfoundland with Labrador, the Gulf of St. Lawrence\r\nthen being land. From Nova Scotia to southern New Jersey the coast-line\r\nwas many miles to the east and south of its present position, but the\r\nsea encroached here and there upon the shores of Virginia, the Carolinas\r\nand Georgia, and southern Florida was mostly under water, as was also a\r\nnarrow strip of the Gulf coast from Florida to Texas and along the east\r\nof Mexico. On the Pacific side of the continent the marine Pliocene is\r\nfar thicker and more important than on the east coast and in California\r\nis largely made up of volcanic materials. Quite extensive disturbances\r\nin this region had marked the close of the Miocene, the strata of\r\nwhich in the Coast Range had been violently compressed and folded. An\r\nelevation of the land had caused the sea to withdraw from the central\r\nvalley of California and had restored Lower California to its peninsular\r\nconditions, reducing the gulf to the narrow limits which it had had in\r\nthe lower Miocene and extending southern Mexico to the west and south.\r\nBritish Columbia and southeastern Alaska stood at higher than their\r\npresent levels and the countless islands of that region were part of\r\nthe mainland. Bering Strait was closed, for at least a great part of\r\nthe epoch, and, as a continuous shore-line was thus formed and a way of\r\nmigration opened, the marine fauna of California and Japan became closely\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—Map of North America during the Pliocene epoch,\r\nBering Strait open. Explanation as in Fig. 48. (Modified from Schuchert.)]\r\n\r\nIn the interior, the Pliocene continental formations and faunas followed\r\nso gradually upon those of the Miocene, that there is great doubt as to\r\nwhere the line between them should be drawn. These interior formations\r\nare mostly of small extent and are very widely scattered, and much\r\nremains to be learned regarding the mammals of the epoch. In northern\r\nKansas are the _Republican River_ beds, which are so doubtfully Pliocene,\r\nthat they may almost equally well be called uppermost Miocene. Other\r\nlower Pliocene stages, representing various divisions of time, are the\r\n_Alachua_ of northern Florida, the _Snake Creek_ of western Nebraska,\r\nthe _Thousand Creek_ and _Virgin Valley_ of northwestern Nevada and the\r\n_Rattlesnake_ of Oregon. Probably middle Pliocene is the _Blanco_ of\r\nnorthwestern Texas, a valley cut in the middle and lower Miocene rocks\r\nand filled in with Pliocene deposits. Possibly upper Pliocene, or, it may\r\nbe, lowest Pleistocene, are the _Peace Creek_ of southwestern Florida and\r\nthe so-called “_Loup River_” (not Loup Fork) of western Nebraska.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic activity of the Rocky Mountain and Pacific coast regions,\r\nwhich was so remarkable in the Miocene, continued into and perhaps\r\nthrough the Pliocene. The great outflow of light-coloured lava which\r\nbuilt up the central plateau of the Yellowstone Park is referred to the\r\nPliocene, and some of the enormous fissure-eruptions which formed the\r\nvast Columbia River fields of black basaltic lava were probably Pliocene,\r\nas some were demonstrably Miocene. Both of these epochs were remarkable\r\nfor volcanic activity in the western part of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe Pliocene climate, as may be inferred from the plants and marine\r\nshells, was colder than that of the Miocene, and refrigeration was\r\nprogressive, as is shown by the proportion of Arctic shells in the\r\nPliocene beds of the east coast of England, rising from 5 per cent in\r\nthe oldest to more than 60 per cent in the latest beds. In the Arctic\r\nregions the cold must have been severe, at least during the latter half\r\nof the epoch, for in the succeeding Pleistocene we find an Arctic fauna\r\nalready fully adapted to the extreme severity of present day polar\r\nconditions and time was necessary for such an adaptation. In the western\r\ninterior the climate was not only colder, but also drier than it had\r\nbeen in the Miocene, the desiccation which had begun in the latter epoch\r\nbecoming progressively more and more marked.\r\n\r\n_South America._—The Greater Antilles were larger than at present and\r\nCuba was much extended, especially to the southeastward, and was probably\r\nconnected with the mainland, not as one would naturally expect, with\r\nYucatan, but with Central America; this island, it is most likely, was\r\ncut off from Hayti. The Isthmian region was considerably broader than\r\nit is now and afforded a more convenient highway of intermigration.\r\nCosta Rica was invaded by a Pliocene gulf, but it is not yet clear\r\nwhether this persisted for the whole or only a part of the epoch. In the\r\nArgentine province of Entrerios is a formation, the _Paraná_, which is\r\nmost probably Pliocene, though it may be upper Miocene. This formation\r\nis largely marine and shows that the present Rio de la Plata was then a\r\ngulf from the Atlantic. A few northern hemisphere mammals in the Paraná\r\nbeds show that the migration had advanced far into South America. A large\r\npart of Patagonia was again submerged beneath the sea, which extended\r\nto the Andes in places, but just how general the submergence was, it\r\nis impossible to say, for the _Cape Fairweather_ formation has been\r\nlargely carried away by erosion and only fragments of it remain. Along\r\nthe foothills of the Andes these beds are upturned and raised several\r\nthousand feet above the sea-level, a proof that the final upheaval of\r\nthe southern mountains took place at some time later than the early\r\nPliocene. Continental formations of Pliocene date are largely developed\r\nin Argentina; the _Araucanian_ stage is in two substages, one in the\r\nprovince of Catamarca, where the beds are much indurated and were\r\ninvolved in the Andean uplift, the other, of unconsolidated materials, is\r\nat Monte Hermoso near Bahia Blanca on the Atlantic coast. The very small\r\nproportion of northern animals in the Araucanian beds is surprising, but\r\nnot more so than the almost complete absence of South American types in\r\nthe upper Miocene and lower Pliocene of the United States. Intermigration\r\nbetween the two Americas would seem to have been a much slower and more\r\ndifficult process than between North America and the Old World, and the\r\nreason for the difference is probably the greater climatic barriers\r\ninvolved in a migration along the lines of longitude. Upper Pliocene is\r\nfound in the Tarija Valley of Bolivia and probably also in Ecuador, in\r\nboth of which areas the proportion of northern animals was very greatly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. QUATERNARY PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe Quaternary period was a time of remarkable geographical and climatic\r\nchanges, which had the profoundest and most far-reaching effects,\r\npartly by migration and partly by extinction, upon the distribution of\r\nanimals and plants, effects which are naturally more obvious than those\r\nof earlier geological events, just because they were the latest. It is\r\ncustomary to divide the period into two epochs, (1) the _Pleistocene_ or\r\n_Glacial_, and (2) the _Recent_, which continues to the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Pleistocene Epoch_\r\n\r\nWhen Louis Agassiz first suggested (1840) the idea of a time,\r\ncomparatively recent in the geological sense, when northern and central\r\nEurope was buried under immense sheets of slowly moving ice, like\r\nthe “ice-cap” of modern Greenland, the conception was received with\r\nincredulity. Nearly thirty years passed before this startling theory\r\ngained the general acceptance of geologists, but now it is one of the\r\ncommonplaces of the science, for no other hypothesis so well explains\r\nthe complicated phenomena of Pleistocene geology. One great obstacle\r\nto the acceptance of the glacial theory was the supposed fact that the\r\nPleistocene glaciation was something quite unique in the history of\r\nthe earth, a violent aberration in the development of climates. Now,\r\nhowever, we have every reason to believe that at least three other and\r\nvery ancient periods had witnessed similar climatic changes and that\r\n“ice-ages” were recurrent phenomena. This is not the place to discuss or\r\neven to summarize the evidence which has convinced nearly all geologists\r\nof the reality of Pleistocene glacial conditions on a vast scale in Asia,\r\nEurope and, above all, in North America. The reader who may wish to\r\nexamine this evidence will find an admirable presentation of it in Vol.\r\nIII of the “Geology” of Professors Chamberlin and Salisbury.\r\n\r\n_North America._—There has long been a difference of opinion among\r\nstudents of the Pleistocene as to whether the glaciation was single,\r\nor several times renewed. That there were many advances and retreats\r\nof the ice, is not denied; the question is, whether there were truly\r\ninterglacial stages, when the ice altogether disappeared from the\r\ncontinent and the climate was greatly ameliorated. The present tendency\r\namong American and European geologists is decidedly in favour of\r\naccepting several distinct glacial stages (Chamberlin and Salisbury\r\nadmit six of these) separated by interglacial stages, and for this there\r\nare very strong reasons. While it is out of the question to present the\r\nevidence for this conclusion here, one or two significant facts may be\r\nnoted. On the north shore of Lake Ontario, near Toronto, are certain\r\nwater-made deposits, which rest upon one sheet of glacial drift and are\r\noverlaid by another. The fossils of the aqueous sediments are in two\r\nseries, upper and lower, of which the older and lower contains plants and\r\ninsects indicative of a climate considerably warmer than that of the same\r\nregion to-day and corresponding to the temperature of modern Virginia. In\r\nthe upper and newer beds the fossils show the return of cold conditions,\r\nmuch like those of southern Labrador, and this was followed by the\r\nreëstablishment of the ice, as recorded in the upper sheet of drift.\r\nEven far to the north, on the Hudson’s Bay slope, an interglacial forest\r\nis embedded between two glacial drift-sheets. In Iowa and South Dakota\r\nnumerous mammals of temperate character occur in interglacial beds.\r\n\r\nAt the time of their greatest extension, the glaciers covered North\r\nAmerica down to latitude 40° N., though the great terminal moraine,\r\nwhich marks the ice-front and has been traced across the continent from\r\nNantucket to British Columbia, describes a very sinuous line. The ice\r\nwas not a homogeneous sheet, moving southward as a whole, but flowed in\r\nall directions away from several, probably four, centres of accumulation\r\nand dispersal. At the same time, the western mountain ranges had a far\r\ngreater snow-supply than at present, and great glaciers flowed down all\r\nthe valleys of the Rocky Mountains as far south as New Mexico and in the\r\nSierras to southern California, while the Wasatch, Uinta and Cascade\r\nranges and those of British Columbia and Alaska were heavily glaciated,\r\nbut, strange to say, the lowlands of Alaska were free from ice. During\r\nthe periods of greatest cold the rain-belt was displaced far to the south\r\nof its normal position, bringing a heavy precipitation to regions which\r\nare now extremely arid. In the Great Basin were formed two very large\r\nlakes; on the east side, rising high upon the flanks of the Wasatch\r\nMountains, was Lake Bonneville, the shrunken and pygmy remnant of which\r\nis the Salt Lake of Utah, and on the west side, in Nevada, was Lake\r\nLahontan. Lake Bonneville, which was nearly two-thirds the size of Lake\r\nSuperior, discharged northward into the Snake River, a tributary of the\r\nColumbia, but Lahontan had no outlet. Each of these lakes had two periods\r\nof expansion, with a time of complete desiccation between them.\r\n\r\nOver the Great Plains the principal Pleistocene formation is that known\r\nas the _Sheridan_, or, from the abundance of horse-remains which are\r\nentombed in it, the _Equus Beds_. These beds extend as a mantle of\r\nwind-drifted and compacted dust from South Dakota to Texas and in places\r\ncontain multitudes of fossil bones; they correspond to one of the early\r\ninterglacial stages and in South Dakota pass underneath a glacial moraine.\r\n\r\nThe upheaval which came at or near the end of the Pliocene had raised the\r\ncontinent, or at least its northeastern portion, to a height considerably\r\ngreater than it has at present, and this must have facilitated the\r\ngathering of great masses of snow; but before the end of the Pleistocene\r\na subsidence of the same region brought about important geographical\r\nchanges. The depression, which lowered the coast at the mouth of the\r\nHudson about 70 feet below its present level, increased northward to 600\r\nfeet or more in the St. Lawrence Valley and allowed the sea to invade\r\nthat valley and enter Lake Ontario. From this gulf ran two long, narrow\r\nbays, one far up the valley of the Ottawa and the other into the basin\r\nof Lake Champlain. The raised beaches, containing marine shells and the\r\nbones of whales, seals and walruses, give eloquent testimony of those\r\nvanished seas. The recovery from this depression and the rise of the\r\ncontinent to its present level inaugurated the Recent epoch.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice had finally disappeared, it left behind it great sheets\r\nof drift, which completely changed the surface of the country and\r\nrevolutionized the systems of drainage by filling up the old valleys,\r\nonly the largest streams being able to regain their former courses.\r\nHundreds of buried valleys have been disclosed by the borings for oil and\r\ngas in the Middle West, and these, when mapped, show a system of drainage\r\nvery different from that of modern times. Innumerable lakes, large and\r\nsmall, were formed in depressions and rock-basins and behind morainic\r\ndams, the contrast between the glaciated and non-glaciated regions in\r\nregard to the number of lakes in each being very striking.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast events were quite different; marine Pleistocene beds\r\nin two stages are found in southern California. The upheavals late in\r\nthe Pleistocene, or at its close, were far greater than on the Atlantic\r\nside, 4000 feet in southeastern Alaska, 200 feet on the coast of Oregon\r\nand rising again to 3000 feet in southern California; all the western\r\nmountain ranges and plateaus were increased in height by these movements.\r\nThe volcanoes continued to be very active, as may be seen from the\r\nlava-sheets and streams in Alaska, all the Pacific states, Arizona and\r\nNew Mexico.\r\n\r\n_South America._—No such vast ice-sheets were formed in the southern\r\nhemisphere as in the northern. Patagonia was the only part of South\r\nAmerica to be extensively covered with ice and there traces of three\r\nglaciations have been observed, of which the first was the greatest and\r\nreached to the Atlantic coast, and there were great ice-masses on the\r\ncoast of southern Chili. Mountain glaciers existed throughout the length\r\nof the Andes across the Equator to 11° N. lat., the elevation increasing\r\nnorthward to the tropics. The surface of the great Argentine plain of the\r\nPampas between 30° and 40° S. lat. is covered with a vast mantle, largely\r\nof wind-accumulated dust, the _Pampean_, which is the sepulchre of an\r\nastonishing number of great and strange beasts. The Pampean formation\r\ncorresponds in a general way to the Sheridan or Equus Beds of North\r\nAmerica, but involves a much greater lapse of time, beginning earlier,\r\npossibly in the late Pliocene, and apparently lasting through the entire\r\nPleistocene. While largely of æolian origin, the Pampean seems to be in\r\npart made of delta deposits laid down by rivers. One striking difference\r\nbetween the Pampean, on the one hand, and the Sheridan and the loess of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley and of Europe, on the other, is that the former is\r\nin many places much more consolidated and stony, which gives it a false\r\nappearance of antiquity. Another and very rich source of Pleistocene\r\nmammals is found in the limestone caves of eastern Brazil, which have\r\nyielded an incredible quantity of such material, but not in such a\r\nremarkably perfect state of preservation as the skeletons of the Pampean.\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the Pleistocene in the West Indies, though\r\nprobably to this date should be assigned the notable oscillations of\r\nlevel which are recorded in the raised sea-terraces of Cuba and other\r\nislands. The Windward groups were joined, at least in part, to the\r\ncontinent and large extinct rodents reached Antigua, which would not be\r\npossible under present conditions. The Isthmus of Panama was 200 feet or\r\nmore higher than it is now and correspondingly wider, but was depressed\r\nto a lower than the present level, and finally raised to the height it\r\nnow has. Marine beds, of presumably Pleistocene date and certainly not\r\nolder, extend from the Caribbean shore to Gatun, some seven miles, and\r\nare nowhere more than a few feet above sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe question of Pleistocene climates is a very vexed one and is far\r\nfrom having received a definitive answer. Limitations of space forbid a\r\ndiscussion of the problem here and I shall therefore merely state the\r\nconclusions which seem best supported by the evidence so far available.\r\nSuch immense accumulations of ice might be due either to greatly\r\nincreased snow-fall, or to a general lowering of the temperature. The\r\nbalance of testimony is in favour of the latter factor and no great\r\nrefrigeration is required. Professor Penck has calculated that a\r\nreduction of 6° or 7° in the average yearly temperature would restore\r\nglacial conditions in Europe. Even the tropics were affected by the\r\nchange, as is shown not only by the glaciation of the Andes, but also by\r\nMt. Kenya, which is almost on the Equator in eastern Africa and still\r\nhas glaciers. The presumably Pleistocene ice covered the whole mountain\r\nlike a cap, descending 5400 feet below the present glacier limit. It was\r\npointed out above that the interglacial stages had greatly ameliorated\r\nclimatic conditions and that, in some of them at least, the climate was\r\nwarmer than it is to-day in the same localities. The cause of these\r\nastonishing fluctuations and of the climatic changes in general, to which\r\nGeology bears witness, still remains an altogether insoluble mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MAMMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo every one who has paid the slightest attention to the subject, it is a\r\nfamiliar fact that different parts of the earth have different animals;\r\nschool-children learn from their geographies that kangaroos are found\r\nin Australia, the Hippopotamus in Africa, the Tiger in southern Asia,\r\narmadillos and llamas in South America. These examples are all taken from\r\ndistant lands, yet the zoölogical difference between two given land-areas\r\nis by no means proportional to the distance between them. An Englishman\r\nlanding in Japan finds himself surrounded by animals and plants very\r\nlike and often identical with those which he left at home, while the\r\nnarrow Strait of Lombok, east of Java, separates two profoundly different\r\nregions. In crossing Mexico from east to west, the traveller meets very\r\ndifferent animals in closely adjacent areas; and, at first sight, the\r\narrangement of animals appears to be so capricious as to admit of no\r\nformulation in general laws.\r\n\r\nIn pre-Darwinian times, when it was the almost universal belief that\r\neach species had been separately created and was exactly fitted to the\r\nregion which it inhabits, no explanation of the geographical arrangement\r\nof animals was possible, but the acceptance of the theory of evolution\r\ndemanded that such an explanation should be found. A failure to devise\r\nany rational and satisfactory account of the geography of animal life\r\nwould be a fatal weakness in the evolutionary theory, hence the facts of\r\ndistribution were subjected to a renewed and searching analysis as one\r\nof the best means of critically testing the new doctrine. Not that the\r\nsubject had received no attention before the publication of Darwin’s\r\nbook; on the contrary, it had attracted much interest as a study of\r\nfacts, and this study was one of the principal avenues by which Darwin\r\napproached his great generalization. In his autobiographical fragment\r\nhe tells us: “I had been deeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean\r\nformation great fossil animals covered with armour like that on the\r\nexisting armadillos; secondly, by the manner in which closely allied\r\nanimals replace one another in proceeding southward over the Continent;\r\nand third, by the South American character of most of the productions of\r\nthe Galapagos archipelago and more especially by the manner in which they\r\ndiffer slightly in each island of the group.”\r\n\r\nObviously, before attempting to explain the facts of the geographical\r\ndistribution of mammals, we must first ascertain what those facts are.\r\nThe following brief sketch of the terms used in describing geographical\r\narrangement is summarized from Mr. Wallace’s “Island Life.”\r\n\r\nThough with fluctuating boundaries and subject to slow secular changes, a\r\nmammalian species is limited to a fairly definite area, which may be of\r\nimmense or very restricted extent, and throughout which it may be found\r\nin greater or less abundance. Many species, however, are not distributed\r\ncontinuously over the areas which they inhabit, but occur only in\r\nsuitable _stations_ adapted to their habits and mode of life. Thus, some\r\nwill be found only where there are trees, others in the neighbourhood of\r\nwater, others only on open plains, etc. A _specific area_ is then the\r\nwhole extent of country within which the species may be found, while the\r\n_stations_ are the limited districts contained in the area which are\r\nexactly suited to the habits of the species in question; these stations\r\nmay be hundreds of miles apart, as in the case of mountain-tops, or they\r\nmay be close together. A marsh-living species, for example, will occur\r\nin all the marshes throughout its area, whether these be many or few,\r\nnear together or widely scattered; for such a species marshes are its\r\nstations.\r\n\r\n_Generic areas_ differ in character according as the genus is large,\r\nthat is, comprising many species, or small and having but few species,\r\nor, it may be, a single one. The species, as a rule, occupy each its own\r\narea, and the areas may be entirely distinct, or they may be contiguous\r\nand more or less extensively overlapping, though it seldom happens that\r\ntwo or more species of the same genus inhabit exactly the same area.\r\nOften some physical feature, such as a range of high mountains, a great\r\nriver, the edge of a forest, plain or desert, exactly defines the limits\r\nof species of the same genus. The Amazon, for example, acts as such a\r\nboundary to many species. It was to this change of related species from\r\none area to another that Darwin referred in the passage quoted above,\r\nsaying that he had been deeply impressed “by the manner in which closely\r\nallied animals replace one another in proceeding southward over the\r\nContinent [_i.e._ South America].” On the other hand, the overlapping of\r\nareas may be very extensive, and one species of great range may cover the\r\nwhole area of another and much more besides.\r\n\r\nA remarkable example of the widely separated areas of species belonging\r\nto the same genus is that of the tapirs. Of this genus there are two\r\nor three species in Central and South America and one inhabiting the\r\nMalay Peninsula and Borneo, almost as wide a separation as the size of\r\nthe earth permits. Discontinuous distribution of this character can be\r\nexplained in terms of the evolutionary theory only in one of two ways.\r\nEither (1) the American and Asiatic species developed independently of\r\none another from different ancestors, or (2) the regions intervening\r\nbetween these widely separated areas once formed a continuous land,\r\noccupied by species of the genus which have become extinct. From all that\r\nwe know concerning the operation of the evolutionary process, the first\r\nalternative may be set aside as altogether improbable, and, even had we\r\nno information concerning the history of the tapirs and their former\r\ndistribution, the second explanation would be chosen as incomparably the\r\nmore likely. As a matter of fact, we have definite knowledge that tapirs\r\nonce ranged all over Europe and North America and doubtless over northern\r\nAsia, as well, and, further, that North America was joined to Asia by a\r\nland occupying the place of the shallow Bering Sea, at a time when the\r\ntapirs were able to take advantage of this means of passing from one\r\ncontinent to the other. Such appears to be the invariable explanation of\r\ndiscontinuous distribution, though we may not always be able to give so\r\nclear a proof of it.\r\n\r\nThe genera of a family are distributed in much the same fashion as the\r\nspecies of a genus, but, as a rule, much more widely. While no genus of\r\nterrestrial mammals is cosmopolitan (_i.e._ universally distributed),\r\nat least as genera are defined and limited by most modern systematists,\r\ncertain families are represented in every continent. If the extremely\r\npeculiar and isolated Australian continent be excepted, the number\r\nof such cosmopolitan families is considerable and wide separation\r\nbetween the genera is frequent. Of the camel family, for instance, one\r\ngenus, that of the true Camel (_Camelus_), is confined to the northern\r\nhemisphere and the Old World, the other (_Lama_), comprising the Llama,\r\nGuanaco, etc., is found only in the southern hemisphere and the New\r\nWorld. Less extreme instances of the discontinuous distribution of a\r\nfamily are common enough.\r\n\r\nThe principles of distribution are the same when applied to families and\r\norders. Most of the mammalian orders are very widely distributed and many\r\nare cosmopolitan, except for Australia, though some are confined to one\r\nor two continents. The monotremes are limited to Australia and Tasmania,\r\nthe marsupials to Australia and the Americas, the edentates to the\r\nlatter, the elephants and hyracoids to Africa and Asia. Carnivores and\r\nrodents, on the contrary, are found in every continent, even Australia.\r\n\r\nWe have next to inquire what is the nature of the obstacles or barriers\r\nthat prevent the indefinite spread of terrestrial mammals, so that the\r\nmammalian fauna of the whole earth, and even of a single continent,\r\nis not uniform, but highly variegated. The rate of multiplication of\r\nanimals is so rapid that, under normal conditions, the animal population\r\nis always pressing hard upon the means of subsistence and every species\r\nthat is increasing in numbers must constantly extend its range in search\r\nof food. Every species would increase indefinitely, if there were no\r\ncountervailing checks. Were all the young to survive and breed in their\r\nturn, “even large and slow-breeding mammals, which only have one at a\r\nbirth, but continue to breed from eight to ten successive years, may\r\nincrease from a single pair to 10,000,000 in forty years” (Wallace).\r\nEvidently, a species must spread from its place of origin until stopped\r\nby insuperable obstacles, the most obvious of which are wide seas. A few\r\nland mammals are not only excellent swimmers, but will cross straits\r\nwithout hesitation, as the Guanaco has been seen to swim the Straits\r\nof Magellan; for the great majority, however, a very few miles of sea\r\nform an impassable barrier. As was shown above, a broad or deep river is\r\nsufficient to limit many species, as the Santa Cruz River in Patagonia\r\nmarks the southern boundary of the armadillos.\r\n\r\nImportant geographical changes, such as the joining of lands that before\r\nwere separate, or the dividing of continuous lands by transgressions\r\nand incursions of the sea, must necessarily have a profound effect upon\r\nthe distribution of land mammals. Separated land-areas, however similar\r\nmay have been their faunas at the time of separation, will, through the\r\noperation of the divergent evolutionary process, grow more unlike in\r\nproportion to the length of time that the separation continues. Regions\r\nwhich have been severed within a short time (in the geological sense of a\r\nshort time) are zoölogically very similar or even identical, while those\r\nthat have long been isolated are correspondingly peculiar. Attention has\r\nalready been called, in another connection, to the contrasted cases of\r\nsuch great continental islands as Great Britain, Java, Sumatra, etc.,\r\non the one hand, and Australia, on the other. The continental islands,\r\nwhich have but lately been detached from the neighbouring main lands,\r\nare hardly more peculiar zoölogically than equal areas of the adjoining\r\ncontinents, while the long-continued isolation of Australia has made it\r\nthe most peculiar region of the earth. Climatic changes, which, as we\r\nsaw in Chapter I, have indubitably taken place many times, have also had\r\na great effect in shifting the distribution of mammals, which in its\r\npresent form is the outcome of a very long series of geographical and\r\nclimatic changes, on the one hand, and of adaptive changes in the animals\r\nthemselves, on the other.\r\n\r\nOf almost equal importance as a barrier is climate and especially\r\ntemperature. Not that similar climates can produce similar forms in\r\nseparate areas. Regions of almost exactly similar climate in Australia,\r\nAfrica and South America have totally different faunas, but, _within\r\ncontinuous land-areas_, the most effective of barriers is temperature.\r\nThis acts differently in the case of limiting the northward spread\r\nof southern forms and the southward spread of northern species. Dr.\r\nMerriam’s long study of this problem has led him to the conclusion\r\nthat southern species are bounded on the north by the temperature of\r\nthe breeding season, in which the total quantity of heat must reach a\r\ncertain minimum, while “animals and plants are restricted in southward\r\ndistribution by the mean temperature of a brief period covering the\r\nhottest part of the year.” On the Pacific coast there is a remarkable\r\nmingling in the same areas of species which, east of the high mountains,\r\nare distributed in sharply separated zones. This is explained by the mild\r\nand equable climate of the coastal belt, where the hottest season of the\r\nyear does not reach the limiting maximum for the northern species, while\r\nthe total quantity of heat in the breeding season is sufficient to enable\r\nsouthern species to thrive and maintain themselves.\r\n\r\nDr. Merriam thus sums up the effects of climatic factors upon\r\ndistribution: “Humidity and other secondary causes determine the presence\r\nor absence of particular species in particular localities within their\r\nappropriate zones, but temperature pre-determines the possibilities of\r\ndistribution; it fixes the limits beyond which species cannot pass.”\r\n“Concurrently with these changes in vegetation from the south northward\r\noccur equally marked differences in the mammals, birds, reptiles,\r\nand insects. Among mammals the tapirs, monkeys, armadillos, nasuas,\r\npeccaries, and opossums of Central America and Mexico are replaced to the\r\nnorthward by wood-rats, marmots, chipmunks, foxes, rabbits, short-tailed\r\nfield-mice of several genera, shrews, wild-cats, lynxes, short-tailed\r\nporcupines, elk, moose, reindeer, sables, fishers, wolverines, lemmings,\r\nmusk-oxen, and polar bears.”\r\n\r\nDr. J. A. Allen has reached closely similar conclusions. “Of strictly\r\nclimatic influences, temperature is by far the most important, although\r\nmoisture plays an influential part. Where a low temperature prevails\r\nlife, both animal and vegetable, is represented by comparatively few\r\nforms; under a high temperature it is characterized by great diversity\r\nand luxuriance. Within the Arctic Circle the species of both animals\r\nand plants are not only few, but they are widely distributed, being for\r\nthe most part everywhere the same. Under the tropics they are a hundred\r\nfold more numerous and of comparatively restricted distribution.” “The\r\ninfluence of temperature is perhaps most strikingly displayed in the\r\ndistribution of life upon the slopes of a high mountain, especially if\r\nsituated near the tropics. While its base may be clothed with palms\r\nand luxuriant tropical vegetation, its summit may be snow-capped\r\nand barren.... The animal life becomes likewise correspondingly\r\nchanged, tropical forms of mammals, birds, and insects of the lower\r\nslopes gradually giving place to such as are characteristic of arctic\r\nlatitudes.” “The effect of humidity upon plant life is thus obvious,\r\nbut it is equally potent, though less evident, upon animal life. Many\r\nanimals ... are so fitted for a forest life, as regards both food and\r\nshelter, that their very existence depends upon such surroundings....\r\nThus moisture alone may determine the character of life over extensive\r\nregions.”\r\n\r\nWhile climate is thus the most important of the barriers which determine\r\ndistribution in continuous land-areas, the absence of any particular\r\nspecies from a given region is no proof that the climate is unsuitable\r\nto that species. This is sufficiently shown by the manner in which\r\nanimals introduced into a new country often run wild and multiply to an\r\nincredible extent, as the rabbits have done in Australia, the Mongoose in\r\nJamaica, horses on our western plains, horses and cattle on the Pampas of\r\nArgentina, etc.\r\n\r\nTopographical features, such as great mountain-ranges and plateaus,\r\nalso limit many species, not only by the difficulty of crossing them,\r\nbut also by the effect which they have upon temperature and moisture.\r\nFor this reason long ranges of mountains and table-lands may carry a\r\nnorthern fauna very far to the south of its ordinary range, as do the\r\nmountain-systems of North America in a very conspicuous manner. The\r\ngreat Mexican plateau is zoölogically a part of North America, while the\r\nlow coastal lands as far as southeastern Texas have Central American\r\naffinities.\r\n\r\nA different kind of obstacle to the spread of a species into a new\r\narea may be the pre-occupation of that area by another species. The\r\npre-occupier may be one that plays so similar a part in the economy of\r\nnature as to leave no opportunity for the newcomer to establish itself.\r\nOn the other hand, the obstructing form may be an active enemy and of\r\na totally different character from the intruder, as in the case of the\r\nTse-tse Fly in parts of Africa. The bite of the fly is fatal to horses\r\nand oxen, so that these mammals are unable to enter the fly-infested\r\nregions. Many times in the course of the Tertiary period various mammals\r\nreached North America from the south or from the Old World, which\r\nwere unable to gain a permanent foothold and speedily died out. At\r\nthis distance of time it is seldom, if ever, possible to explain why a\r\nspecies which succeeded in reaching this continent could not maintain\r\nitself, though the most probable assumption is that the forms already in\r\npossession of the land were an insuperable obstacle to the intruders.\r\n\r\nThe rate of dispersal of a species into new areas may be fast or slow,\r\naccording as the conditions are more or less favourable. Newly introduced\r\ninsect-pests, like the Gypsy and the Brown-tailed Moths in New England,\r\noften spread with portentous rapidity; and introduced mammals have\r\nfrequently taken possession of vast areas in a surprisingly short time.\r\nOne of the most remarkable of these cases is cited by Darwin. “In the\r\ntime of Sarmiento (1580) these Indians had bows and arrows, now long\r\nsince disused; they then also possessed some horses. This is a very\r\ncurious fact, showing the extraordinarily rapid multiplication of horses\r\nin South America. The horse was first landed at Buenos Ayres in 1537\r\nand the colony being then for a time deserted, the horse ran wild; in\r\n1580, only forty-three years afterwards, we hear of them at the Strait\r\nof Magellan!” (“Voyage of a Naturalist,” pp. 232-233.) In this example,\r\nsomething must be allowed for human agency, but even so, it is very\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\nIn the case of lands newly raised above the sea and connecting formerly\r\nseparated areas, it is necessary that they should first be taken\r\npossession of by vegetation, before they can become passable by animals,\r\nfor the migration of mammals from continent to continent is an entirely\r\ndistinct phenomenon from the annual migration of birds. The latter,\r\nthough a fact familiar to every one, is an unexplained mystery, and it is\r\nsomewhat unfortunate that the same term should be used for the completely\r\ndifferent process of the spread of mammals into newly opened land. This\r\nspread is purely unconscious and is due to the pressure of increasing\r\nnumbers upon the means of subsistence, each new generation ranging\r\nfarther and farther from the original home of the species and continuing\r\nso to extend until some insuperable obstacle is encountered. When a\r\nsea-barrier is removed by upheaval and the newly formed land rendered\r\nhabitable for mammals through the invasion of plants, the interrupted\r\nprocess is resumed and an interchange of species between the areas thus\r\nconnected is brought about. The interchange is, however, always an\r\nincomplete one, certain forms not being able so to extend their range,\r\nbecause of climatic differences, pre-occupation or some such barrier.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to give a graphic expression to the facts of animal\r\ndistribution by dividing the land surface of the earth into districts\r\nwhich are characterized by their faunas. It is not possible to construct\r\na geographical scheme which will be equally satisfactory for all classes\r\nof animals, because the geological date of most rapid development and\r\ndiffusion was so different in the various classes. The geographical and\r\nclimatic conditions which favoured a particular geographical arrangement\r\nof one class had been so completely altered that the class coming in\r\nlater could not attain a similar distribution. For this reason, land\r\nmammals are chosen as affording the best criteria; their adaptability is\r\nsuch that they are found all over the earth, their dispersal is primarily\r\ndependent upon the arrangement and connections of the continental\r\nland-masses, modified by the topographical and climatic conditions, and\r\nthey, with the birds, are the latest of the vertebrate classes to assume\r\na dominating importance. Their history is the most fully known and falls\r\nwithin the best understood portion of the earth’s history, making it\r\npossible to follow their migrations with a precision which is seldom\r\nfeasible for the other classes of animals, and thus to correlate the\r\nsuccessive physical and organic changes. A particularly great advantage\r\nwhich mammals possess for this purpose is that the mutual relationships\r\nof the various kinds are better understood than in the case of most\r\nother groups of animals. It is true that we shall find a great many\r\nunsolved problems, upon which the most divergent opinions are held, but\r\nthe main outlines of the scheme are quite generally agreed upon.\r\n\r\nMany plans for the zoölogical division of the continental areas have been\r\nproposed by various writers on the subject, some differing very radically\r\nfrom others. It would be useless and tedious to review even the more\r\nimportant of the many proposals and suggestions which have been made in\r\nthe last half-century; and we may, with advantage, adopt an eclectic\r\nscheme which has been slowly reached by successive approximations to a\r\nsatisfactory arrangement.\r\n\r\nJust as in political geography it is found necessary to recognize\r\ndivisions of different rank and scope, like nation, state, county,\r\ntownship, the facts of zoölogical geography require divisions of\r\ndifferent orders of importance. Thus, in descending order, the terms\r\n_realm_, _region_, _subregion_, _province_, etc. are commonly employed,\r\nbut unfortunately they are often used loosely and even interchangeably;\r\nyet it is desirable to attach a more or less precise significance to each\r\nand more terms are needed for an accurate expression of the many complex\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThe extreme zoölogical peculiarity of Australia is recognized by making\r\nthat continent and its adjoining islands one of the great primary\r\ndivisions, of which the other includes all the rest of the world; the\r\nformer is characterized by its almost exclusively marsupial fauna, while\r\nthe other continents are inhabited by the Monodelphia or placental\r\nmammals. Aside from Australia, by far the most isolated and peculiar\r\nregion of the earth is South America, and this fact is expressed by\r\nconstituting it into a _realm_, or division of the second order, and to\r\nthis realm is given the name _Neogæa_. The remaining continents, North\r\nAmerica, Europe, Asia and Africa, make up the other realm, _Arctogæa_,\r\nin which there is an unmistakable general likeness among the mammals.\r\nThe three continents of the Old World form a vast, connected land-mass,\r\nand the final separation of North America from this great complex is an\r\nevent of geologically recent date. For reasons that will be made clear\r\nin the course of the history, the junction of the two Americas has had\r\ncomparatively little effect upon the zoölogy of the northern continent,\r\nexcept in its tropical portion. It is obvious from a glance at the\r\nmap, that the great zoölogical divisions are of very unequal size, but\r\nthe arrangement is made on the basis of degrees of difference in the\r\nmammalian faunas. These degrees of difference are, in turn, an expression\r\nof length of separation or of the difficulty of communication between\r\nconnected lands.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the major divisions of the earth apart from\r\nAustralia:\r\n\r\n  I.

America\r\n                       {       (except lowlands of Mexico).\r\n\r\nNorth America, as is expressed by this scheme, is zoölogically composite;\r\nthe northern half, including nearly all of Canada, belongs to the vast\r\nHolarctic Region, which also comprises Europe, Africa north of the\r\nSahara and Asia north of the Himalaya Mountains. The remainder of the\r\ncontinent, exclusive of the Mexican coastal lowlands, is set off as the\r\nSonoran Region. Inasmuch as we have here to do with broadly continuous\r\nland-areas, not demarcated by great physical features, and as the genera\r\nand species of mammals differ greatly in regard to their ability to\r\nwithstand a wide range of climatic variations, it is not to be expected\r\nthat the boundaries between the regions which make up North America\r\nshould be very sharply drawn. It is not surprising, therefore, to find\r\na transition zone, extending all across the continent, in which the\r\nHolarctic and Sonoran faunas mingle, or that Central America should,\r\nin considerable measure, be transitional to South America, though\r\nzoölogically a part of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—Zoölogical Divisions of North America. (After\r\nMerriam.)]\r\n\r\nDr. Merriam’s arrangement, which deals only with North America\r\nwithout reference to the Old World, divides the land into a series of\r\ntranscontinental zones, which he calls the Arctic, Boreal, Upper and\r\nLower Sonoran and Tropical. These zones have very irregular and sinuous\r\nboundaries, which follow lines of equal temperature (isothermal lines)\r\nduring the breeding season, May, June and July, the tortuous boundaries\r\nbeing conditioned by topographical features, which deflect the isothermal\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—Polar Bear (_Thalarctus maritimus_).—By\r\npermission of the N.Y. Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\nThe Arctic zone is part of a circumpolar area, which is very much the\r\nsame in North America, Asia and Europe; and in any of these continents\r\nthe fauna differs much more from that of the contiguous zone to the south\r\nthan from the Arctic fauna of another continent. There are some local\r\ndifferences, but the characteristic mammals of this Arctic zone are the\r\nPolar Bear, Arctic Fox, Musk Ox, Barren-ground Caribou, Lemming, Arctic\r\nHare, and a marmot. Most, if not all, of these forms are of Old World\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—Musk Ox (_Ovibos wardi_) female; the males have\r\nmuch larger horns.—By permission of the N.Y. Zoölog.

Soc.]\r\n\r\nThe American portion of the great Holarctic region is called by Mr.\r\nLydekker, who uses Wallace’s term, the “Canadian subregion,” and by\r\nDr. Merriam the “Boreal region.” Not that there is any difference of\r\nprinciple involved in this varying nomenclature, for Dr. Merriam says:\r\n“It so happens that the Boreal element in America resembles that of\r\nEurasia so closely that in the judgment of many eminent authorities\r\nthe two constitute a single primary region—a view in which I heartily\r\nconcur.” The Canadian or Boreal subregion of the Holarctic is the great\r\nbelt of coniferous forest, which extends obliquely across North America\r\nfrom Alaska to New England; its frontier with the Arctic zone is the\r\nnorthern limit of trees and it is divided from the Transition zone\r\napproximately by the line of latitude 45° N., though with a sinuous\r\ncourse, and it is carried far to the south by the wooded heights of the\r\nAppalachian, Rocky and Sierra Nevada Mountains, and along the Pacific\r\ncoast, the mixed character of which has already been explained; it\r\nextends almost to San Francisco. The subregion is further divisible into\r\nnorthern and southern belts, called the Hudsonian and Canadian faunas,\r\nthe limit between them approximately following the isothermal line of\r\n57° F. The mammals of this subregion are largely of Old World origin,\r\nmany of them coming in with the great immigrations of the Pliocene and\r\nPleistocene epochs; but there are also native American elements and even\r\none genus of South American origin, the Short-tailed or Canada Porcupine\r\n(_Erethizon_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.—Canada Porcupine (_Erethizon dorsatus_).—By\r\npermission of the N.Y. Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.—Woodchuck or Marmot (_Marmota monax_).—By\r\npermission of the N.Y. Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—Mink (_Lutreola vison_).—By permission of the\r\nN.Y. Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\nIn considering the mammals of this subregion, it should be remembered\r\nthat they are not uniformly distributed throughout even one subdivision,\r\nbut in a scattering way and in accordance with their habits and stations,\r\nand also in accordance with a gradual change to the south, following the\r\nchanging temperature. The Muskrat will not be found far from water or the\r\nPorcupine from woods. Especially characteristic of the Canadian subregion\r\nare the Old World types of deer, none of which range farther south than\r\nthe Transition zone. The Wapiti, erroneously called the Elk (_Cervus\r\ncanadensis_), is very closely allied to the European Stag (_C. elaphus_)\r\nand still more closely to the Stag of the Thian Shan in Central Asia (_C.\r\neustephanus_). So great is the resemblance, that some naturalists would\r\nrefer all three forms to a single species. The Moose (_Alce americanus_),\r\nwhich should be called the Elk, is so near to the Scandinavian Elk (_A.\r\nmachlis_) that it is hardly distinguishable as a separate species, and\r\nthe Woodland Caribou (_Rangifer caribou_) is the American representative\r\nof the Lapland Reindeer (_R. tarandus_). The so-called Rocky Mountain\r\nGoat (_Oreamnos montanus_), a peculiar and aberrant form of the Chamois\r\nsubfamily of the Antelopes, is confined to the subregion. The Mountain\r\nSheep (_Ovis montana_, _O. dalli_) are represented by three or four\r\nspecies, one of which extends into the Sonoran region, as does also the\r\nBison, wrongly called Buffalo (_Bison bison_), which is nearly allied to\r\nthe European _B. bonasus_. In Cæsar’s time the European Bison (German,\r\nWisent) ranged through Germany and is described in his account of the\r\nHercynian Forest; but the advance of civilization has almost exterminated\r\nit, only a few small herds being maintained by the most rigid protection\r\nin Russia and in the Carpathian Mountains. Of the Carnivora, the weasels,\r\nmartens, Fisher, Mink and Ermine are Boreal, as are the Wolverene\r\n(_Gulo_) and the Grey Wolf (_Canis_), the three last-named extending also\r\ninto the Arctic zone. Essentially Boreal, though reaching and entering\r\nthe Sonoran, are the bears (_Ursus_), the red foxes (_Vulpes_), the\r\notters (_Lutra_) and the Old World shrews (_Sorex_), while the Star-nose\r\nMole (_Condylura_) and the mole-shrews (_Urotrichus_) do not extend\r\nsouth of the Transition zone. Probable intruders from the south into the\r\nBoreal subregion are the pumas, or “mountain lions,” which just enter\r\nthe subregion, the Canada Lynx (_Lynx rufus_) and one species of skunks\r\n(_Mephitis_), the Raccoon (_Procyon lotor_), Badger (_Taxidea americana_)\r\nand the American deer (_Odocoileus_). A large number of rodents are\r\ncharacteristically Boreal: marmots, or woodchucks (_Marmota_), the\r\nSewellel (_Aplodontia rufa_), lemmings (_Myodes_), Jumping Mouse\r\n(_Zapus_), the Canada Porcupine (_Erethizon dorsatus_) and the pikas,\r\n“tailless or whistling hares” (_Ochotona_). Boreal rodents that enter the\r\nSonoran are the chipmunks (_Tamias_), beavers (_Castor_), meadow-mice\r\n(_Microtus_), the Muskrat (_Fiber zibethicus_). The white-footed mice\r\n(_Sitomys_) and the wood-rats (_Neotoma_) are southern rodents that reach\r\nor enter the Boreal.\r\n\r\nBetween the Boreal subregion and the Sonoran region is the Transition\r\nzone, which follows all the complex windings of the boundary lines. It\r\ncovers most of New England, New York, Pennsylvania and southern Ontario;\r\npassing through southern Michigan and Wisconsin, it bends northward over\r\nMinnesota and covers most of North Dakota, Manitoba and the plains of\r\nthe Saskatchewan, then turns abruptly southward and includes eastern\r\nMontana and parts of South Dakota and Nebraska. Crossing Wyoming, it\r\nfollows around the northern edge of the Great Basin to the plains of the\r\nColumbia. The three great mountain-systems carry the zone far to the\r\nsouth and arms of it extend along the Appalachians to northern Georgia,\r\nalong the Rockies to New Mexico, and it follows the Sierras to southern\r\nCalifornia. “The Transition zone, as its name indicates, is a zone of\r\noverlapping Boreal and Sonoran types. Many Boreal genera and species here\r\nreach the extreme southern limits of their distribution and many Sonoran\r\ngenera and species their northern limits. But a single mammalian genus\r\n(_Synaptomys_) [one of the field mice] is restricted to the Transition\r\nzone.... A number of species, however, seem to be nearly or quite\r\nconfined to this zone” (Merriam).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.—Upper figure, European Bison (_Bison bonasus_).\r\nLower figure, American Bison (_B. bison_).—By permission of the N.Y.\r\nZoölog.

Soc.]\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic portion of North America, zoölogically speaking,\r\nis the Sonoran region of Dr. Merriam, the Warm Temperate of Dr. Allen.\r\nIt crosses the continent from ocean to ocean, its northern boundary\r\nfollowing for most of the way the 43d parallel of latitude, but over the\r\nGreat Plains and Great Basin, on each side of the Rocky Mountains and\r\nthe high plateaus, it extends to lat. 48°. On the south, it takes in the\r\ngreater part of Mexico, covering all of the table-land of that country,\r\nthe lowlands of which belong to the South American or Neotropical\r\nregion. The Sonoran is invaded from the north by the long branches\r\nfrom the Boreal and Transition zones, which follow the three great\r\nmountain-systems in the manner already explained, and the Mexican plateau\r\npermits the similar invasion of Neotropical territory by the Sonoran\r\nfauna. Characteristic Sonoran genera, none of which extend into the\r\nBoreal, are the opossums (_Didelphis_), in the southern part a peccary\r\n(_Tagassu_) or “Wild Texas Pig,” representative of a family of swine\r\nquite different from the true pigs of the Old World, and an armadillo\r\n(_Tatu_). A very isolated form is the Prong-horned Antelope (_Antilocapra\r\namericana_); there are several species of the typically American deer\r\n(_Odocoileus_) which differ in important respects from those of the\r\neastern hemisphere, and the Bison was very abundant until exterminated by\r\nMan. Bison, antelope and deer also reach or extend into the Boreal zone,\r\nbut the former, or Wood Bison, is probably a different species from the\r\nplains animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.—Prong-horned Antelope (_Antilocapra\r\namericana_).—By permission of the N.Y.

The American types of shrews (_Blarina_)\r\nand moles (_Scalops_ and _Scapanus_) are characteristic of the Sonoran,\r\nthough partially shared with the Boreal. A great many peculiar rodents\r\ninhabit the Sonoran; cotton-rats (_Sigmodon_), pocket-gophers (_Geomys_,\r\netc.), several genera of the beautiful little kangaroo-rats (_Dipodomys_,\r\netc.); while the prairie-dogs (_Cynomys_), the white-footed mice\r\n(_Sitomys_), wood-rats (_Neotoma_) and one genus of pocket-gophers\r\n(_Thomomys_) are chiefly Sonoran, but have Boreal representatives.\r\nThe flying squirrels (_Sciuropterus_), true squirrels (_Sciurus_),\r\nground-squirrels (_Spermophilus_), rabbits (_Lepus_), wolves (_Canis_)\r\nand otters (_Lutra_) have a very wide range through both the Boreal and\r\nSonoran, but have many more species in the latter region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.—Grey Squirrel (_Sciurus carolinensis_).—By\r\npermission of the N.Y. Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\nThe Sonoran region may be divided into the upper and lower Sonoran zones,\r\nwhich are demarcated by temperature and are of transcontinental extent.\r\nEach of these zones may, in turn, be subdivided into _arid_ and _humid_\r\nprovinces, but our purpose does not necessitate entering into such\r\nrefinements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—Grey Fox (_Urocyon virginianus_).—By permission\r\nof the N.Y.

Soc.]\r\n\r\nThe Neotropical, which is the only region of the Neogæic realm, comprises\r\nthe West Indian islands, all of Central and South America and the\r\nlowlands of Mexico, extending a short distance into southeastern Texas.\r\nOf its four subregions, the most typical is (1) the _Brazilian_, which\r\nincludes not only Brazil, but all of South America east of the Andes and\r\nas far south as Paraguay, and is a vast area of tropical forests. (2)\r\nThe _Chilian_ subregion takes in the west coast, the high Andes and the\r\nsouthern end of the continent, south of the Brazilian subregion; it is\r\na country chiefly of open plains and high mountains, and a few deserts,\r\nof which South America has less than any other continent, except Europe,\r\nwhich has none. (3) The _Central American_ subregion reaches from the\r\nIsthmus of Panama to Mexico, the lowlands of which are included and even\r\na small portion of southeastern Texas. (4) The _West Indian_ subregion\r\nincludes all the islands of that archipelago, except Trinidad, which is a\r\nfragment of the continent, detached at a comparatively recent date; the\r\nsouthern extremity of Florida also belongs to this subregion.\r\n\r\nThe two subregions into which continental South America is divided are\r\nnot altogether satisfactory and will doubtless require change when\r\nthe distribution of South American mammals has been more accurately\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.—Map of the Neotropical region. (After Wallace.)\r\nMexico inaccurate; cf. Fig. 53, p. 147.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.—Fox-like Wolf (_Cerdocyon gracilis_).—By\r\npermission of W. S. Berridge, London.]\r\n\r\n“Richness combined with isolation is the predominant feature of\r\nNeotropical Zoölogy, and no other region can approach it in the number\r\nof its peculiar family and generic types” (Wallace). Just as North\r\nAmerica has received many immigrants from the Old World, so it has sent\r\nmany migrants into South America, materially changing the character of\r\nthe Neotropical mammalian fauna, but these intruders may be readily\r\nidentified and almost seem to be out of place in their new surroundings.\r\nNot all of these northern migrants were able to maintain their footing\r\nin the southern continent and several became extinct during and at the\r\nclose of the Pleistocene epoch, as was even more markedly the case with\r\nthe southern forms which invaded the northern continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.—Spectacled Bear (_Tremarctos ornatus_).—By\r\npermission of the N.Y. Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\nThere are two families of monkeys in the forested areas of South America,\r\nboth very different from those of the Old World. One of these families,\r\nthe marmosets (Hapalidæ), differs from all other monkeys in several\r\nparticulars, most obvious of which are the long claws on the feet and the\r\nnon-opposable thumb. The second family (Cebidæ) comprises forms which are\r\nsuperficially much more like those of the eastern hemisphere, but many of\r\nthem have prehensile tails, which are used as efficient grasping organs.\r\n\r\nInsectivora are entirely absent from the South American continent, but\r\nsome shrews (_Blarina_) have entered Central America from the north and\r\na very curious genus is represented by one species in Cuba (_Solenodon\r\ncubanus_) and another in Hayti (_S. paradoxus_). These remarkable animals\r\nare, strange to relate, most nearly allied to the tenrecs (_Centetes_) of\r\nMadagascar and by some authorities are placed in the same family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.—_Solenodon cubanus._—By permission of the N.Y.\r\nZoölog.

Berridge, London.]\r\n\r\nThe Carnivora are quite numerous and varied and rather peculiar, but\r\nthey all belong to northern families and are the more or less modified\r\ndescendants of northern immigrants. The dogs (Canidæ) belong to\r\ngenera not represented elsewhere and form a considerable assemblage\r\nof interesting types. There are no true wolves or foxes, but several\r\nspecies of fox-like wolves (_Cerdocyon_), with bushy tails, are common,\r\nespecially in the plains regions. The Bush-Dog (_Icticyon venaticus_),\r\na small, short-legged animal, is very peculiar. The musteline or weasel\r\nfamily (Mustelidæ) is rather scantily represented. There are no badgers\r\nand but few skunks (_Spilogale_ and _Conepatus_); weasels are absent,\r\nbut their place is taken by the Grison (_Galera vittata_) and Tayra\r\n(_Tayra tayra_) and in the far south _Lyncodon patagonicus_. These\r\nanimals are peculiar in having a lighter colouration on the back than\r\non the belly. There are two or three species of otter (_Lutra_). The\r\nraccoons (_Procyon_) have a very wide range in South America, as in the\r\nnorthern continent, and the curious, long-snouted coatis (_Nasua_), which\r\njust enter the Sonoran region, are typically Neotropical. The Spectacled\r\nBear (_Tremarctos ornatus_) is the only member of the family that occurs\r\nin South America and is confined to the highlands of Peru and Chili. The\r\ncat family is quite numerously represented; the Jaguar (_Felis onca_),\r\nwhich ranges from Texas to Patagonia, is a large spotted cat, rivalling\r\nthe Leopard in size and ferocity; the Ocelot (_F. pardalis_, Arkansas to\r\nParaguay) is smaller and streaked and blotched rather than spotted. The\r\npumas differ little from those of North America, and there are many small\r\ncats, spotted, clouded and of solid colour, but no lynxes, which are\r\nessentially northern types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.—Tayra (_Tayra tayra_).—By permission of W.

Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\nHoofed animals are not numerously represented in South America. The\r\nonly existing Perissodactyla of the western hemisphere are the tapirs\r\n(_Tapirus_) of Central and tropical South America, a very remarkable\r\ncontrast to the ancient faunas, especially of the northern continent, as\r\nwill be shown in the sequel. The Artiodactyla are more varied, though\r\nvery scanty in comparison with those of the Old World; even North\r\nAmerica, which has but a poor representation of these animals, is much\r\nricher than the southern continent, where, indeed, all the hoofed animals\r\nare the descendants of comparatively recent immigrants from the north\r\nand none are truly autochthonous. Members of three different artiodactyl\r\nsuborders occur in the Neotropical region; the peccaries (_Tagassu_)\r\nextend through Central and South America to Paraguay, though also\r\nentering the Sonoran region in Texas. Most interesting are the members of\r\nthe camel family, which are very distinct from the true Camel of Asia.\r\nTierra del Fuego and the Patagonian plains support great herds of the\r\nGuanaco (_Lama huanacus_), which extends along the Andes to Ecuador and\r\nPeru, where it is associated with the Vicuña (_L. vicunia_), a smaller\r\nand more slenderly built species. The Vicuña does not range south of\r\nBolivia. Just as the mountain systems of North America carry the Boreal\r\nand Transition faunas through nearly the whole breadth of the Sonoran\r\nregion, so the high Andes afford a pathway by which the mammals of the\r\nsouth temperate zone extend their range to the equator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.—Vicuña (_Lama vicunia_).—By permission of the\r\nN.Y.

Soc.]\r\n\r\nThe suborder Pecora of the Artiodactyla is represented in the Neotropical\r\nregion only by the deer family (_Cervidæ_), of which there are several\r\ngenera (or subgenera), all of them North American as distinguished from\r\nthe Old World type, but some are so peculiar that they must have had a\r\nrelatively long South American ancestry. The Virginia Deer (_Odocoileus\r\nvirginianus_) of the northern United States is a comparatively large\r\nanimal, becoming much smaller in Florida and the Southwest. The type\r\nextends through Mexico and Central America to Guiana and Peru, the\r\nNeotropical forms being so small and having such weak antlers that\r\nthey are referred to separate species. Another type is the Marsh Deer\r\n(_Blastoceros paludosus)_ of eastern South America, which has short,\r\nstout antlers, each beam with two double bifurcations; there are other\r\nspecies of the same genus, such as the Pampas Deer of Argentina (_B.\r\nbezoarticus_). In the Andes of Peru and Chili and the forests of western\r\nPatagonia are two species of a genus which bears the preposterous name of\r\n_Hippocamelus_ and in which the antlers are simply forked. The vernacular\r\nname of these animals is “Huemul.” Peculiarly Neotropical are the little\r\nbrockets, which hardly exceed a height of two feet at the shoulder, with\r\nsimple spike-like antlers not more than three inches long; the genus,\r\n_Mazama_, has several species, one of which occurs as far north as the\r\nstate of Puebla in Mexico. “The smallest of all deer is the Chilian pudu\r\n(_Pudua pudu_), a creature not much larger than a hare, with almost\r\nrudimentary antlers” (Lydekker). Old World types of deer, such as the\r\nWapiti, Moose and Caribou, of the Boreal and Transition zones of North\r\nAmerica, are entirely absent from the Neotropical region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.—Wood Brocket (_Mazama nemorivagus_).—By\r\npermission of W.

Soc.]\r\n\r\nSouth America has an astonishingly rich and varied assemblage of\r\nrodents, both indigenous and immigrant, but the former are much the more\r\nimportant, varied and abundant. Of the four divisions of the order,\r\nall of which are represented, three are immigrants from the north and\r\nthe fourth is autochthonous, but this far outnumbers the other three\r\ncombined. The hares and rabbits have but very few species, one of which\r\noccurs in Brazil and is separated by a very wide interval from the one in\r\nCosta Rica, while the pikas are absent. Of the squirrel division, only\r\nthe true squirrels are found, and of these there are many species, the\r\nground-squirrels, marmots, prairie-dogs and beavers all being lacking.\r\nIn the same way the rat and mouse division is represented by a single\r\nfamily. The vesper or white-footed mice (_Sitomys_) have invaded the\r\nsouthern continent and a number of peculiar genera have arisen there, but\r\nall of northern ancestry, such as the groove-toothed mice (_Rheithrodon_)\r\nand the fish-eating rats (_Ichthyomys_). The voles, or meadow-mice, the\r\nmuskrats, jumping mice, kangaroo-rats and pocket-gophers of the northern\r\ncontinent are all absent. While the immigrant suborders have thus but\r\none family each in South America, the case is very different with the\r\nfourth or porcupine group, of which that continent is to-day, as it has\r\nbeen for ages past, the headquarters. No less than six families and\r\ntwenty-nine genera are known, all of the genera and four of the families\r\nbeing restricted to the Neotropical region. Contrast this assemblage with\r\nthe extreme scantiness of this group in North America, where but a single\r\ngenus, the Short-tailed or Canada Porcupine (_Erethizon_) represents it,\r\nand that is a late immigrant from the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.—Neotropical rodents. _A._ Vizcacha\r\n(_Viscaccia_). _B._ Paca (_Agouti paca_). _C._ Rock Cavy (_Cavia\r\nrupestris_). _D._ Water-Hog, or Carpincho (_Hydrochærus_). _D_, by\r\npermission of the N.Y.

Berridge, London.]\r\n\r\nIt would lead us too far to attempt a description of this horde of\r\ncurious and interesting rodents, so only a few of the more striking\r\nand characteristic forms can be mentioned. There are two genera of\r\nporcupines (_Coendou_ and _Chætomys_), both arboreal, which belong in\r\nthe same family as the North American _Erethizon_, but are distinguished\r\nby their long, prehensile tails, which they use, as monkeys and opossums\r\ndo, for grasping and climbing. The very large family of the Octodontidæ\r\nhas 17 Neotropical genera and four others are found in Africa. The\r\nDegu (_Octodon_) of Chili, Bolivia and Peru has the appearance of a\r\nlarge rat with tufted tail; the tuco-tucos (_Ctenomys_) are extremely\r\nabundant burrowers in Patagonia, where they honeycomb the ground over\r\nwide areas. The spiny rats (_Echimys_ and _Loncheres_) are so called\r\nfrom their appearance, not because they are related to the true rats;\r\nthey have numerous horny spikes through the fur of the back. The Coypu\r\n(_Myocastor_) is a large, aquatic animal, remotely like the northern\r\nMuskrat, and the Hutias (_Capromys_ and _Plagiodontia_) are arboreal\r\nand found only in Cuba, Hayti and Jamaica. The chinchillas (_Chinchilla_\r\nand _Lagidium_) of the Andes and the Vizcacha (_Viscaccia_) of the\r\nArgentine plains have somewhat the appearance of hares, but with long\r\nand bushy tails. The cavies, to which the familiar, misnamed Guinea-Pig\r\n(_Cavia porcellus_) belongs, are a very characteristic family; besides\r\nthe true cavies, it includes the Patagonian Mara (_Dolichotis_), a large,\r\nlong-legged, long-eared, short-tailed creature, and the Water-Hog, or\r\nCarpincho (_Hydrochærus_), an aquatic animal, as its name implies, and\r\nmuch the largest of existing rodents; it occurs in the warmer regions,\r\nsouth to Argentina. The heavy Paca (_Agouti_) and the slender-limbed\r\nAgouti (_Dasyprocta_) make up another family. Altogether, this assemblage\r\nof the porcupine-like suborder of rodents is a very remarkable one and in\r\nno other region of the earth is anything like it to be found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.—Hairy-rumped Agouti (_Dasyprocta\r\nprymnolopha_).—By permission of W. S. Berridge, London.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.—Three-toed Sloth (_Bradypus tridactylus_).—By\r\npermission of the N.Y. Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of one genus of armadillos, which has invaded\r\nTexas, the entire order of the Edentata is at present confined to the\r\nNeotropical region, the so-called edentates of the Old World now being\r\nremoved to other orders. The Edentata, which were once far more varied\r\nand abundant than they now are, comprise three groups of animals so\r\nbizarre and strange that they seem more like fabulous creatures than\r\nactual, living mammals. One group, or suborder, is that of the sloths\r\n(Tardigrada), arboreal, shaggy animals, with short, almost monkey-like\r\nhead and no tail; their very long legs and hook-like feet make them\r\nnearly helpless on the ground, but are very useful for hanging from the\r\nbranches of the trees, in which the creatures live. Indeed, the sloths\r\nare the only mammals which habitually hang in a suspended position. Two\r\ngenera of sloths inhabit the tropical forests, between which the most\r\nobvious difference is that in one (_Bradypus_) the forefoot has three\r\ntoes, and in the other (_Cholœpus_) two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.—Two-toed Sloth (_Cholœpus didactylus_).—By\r\npermission of W. S. Berridge, London.]\r\n\r\nThe suborder of the anteaters (Vermilingua) is more varied, and is the\r\nonly one of the order to which the term “edentate” applies strictly, for\r\nthey alone in the order are altogether toothless. The great Ant-Bear\r\n(_Myrmecophaga jubata_), which may reach a total length of seven feet,\r\nhas an extravagantly long, slender and nearly cylindrical head, long,\r\nshaggy, black and white hair and an immense, bushy tail; the forefeet are\r\narmed with huge, sharp-pointed claws, which are used for tearing open\r\nant-hills, and when occasion arises, as formidable weapons of defence,\r\nfor the Ant-Bear can successfully repulse even the Jaguar. In walking,\r\nthe claws are curved inward and the preposterous beast rests his weight\r\nupon the outside edges of the forefeet, while the hind feet apply the\r\nsole to the ground, as does a bear or raccoon. The Collared Anteater\r\n(_Tamandua_) is much smaller and mainly arboreal in habits. It has a\r\nshort-haired, black body, with a white stripe down the back, white neck\r\nand limbs, a colour-pattern which gives to the animal the appearance of\r\nwearing a close-fitting black jacket; the long tail, which has some cross\r\nbars, is short-haired, very different from the extremely bushy tail of\r\nthe Ant-Bear. The little Two-toed Anteater (_Cyclopes didactylus_),\r\nhardly larger than a rat, is exclusively arboreal and has a prehensile\r\ntail, like so many other South American mammals. Sloths and anteaters are\r\nforest animals and are not found west of the Andes or south of Paraguay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.—Ant-Bear (_Myrmecophaga jubata_).—By permission\r\nof the N.Y.

Soc.]\r\n\r\nThe third existing suborder of edentates is that of the armadillos\r\n(Dasypoda), which have a very complete armour of bony scutes,\r\nossifications in the skin, covered with scales of horn. They are all more\r\nor less burrowers in habit and omnivorous in diet, eating roots, insects,\r\nworms, etc.; the extraordinary rapidity with which they burrow into\r\nthe ground is almost their only way of escape from pursuit, but in one\r\ngenus, _Tolypeutes_, the animal can roll itself into a ball, completely\r\nprotected by mail all around. The armadillos are much more varied than\r\nthe anteaters or sloths and have a wider geographical range, extending\r\nfrom Texas to Patagonia. The head, which is long-snouted, is protected\r\nby a shield made up of numerous horn-covered plates of bone, and the\r\ntail is encased in a tubular sheath of more or less regular rings, each\r\nring of bony plates and horny scales. The body-shield, or carapace,\r\nwhich covers the back and sides, consists of an anterior and posterior\r\nbuckler, in which the plates are immovably attached to one another by\r\ntheir edges, and between the two is a series of movable, overlapping\r\nbands, the number of which varies in the different genera. In the little\r\nPichiciago (_Chlamydophorus truncatus_) the head and back are covered\r\nwith four-sided plates of horn, the bony scutes being small and thin\r\nand much reduced. The carapace has no bucklers, but about 20 transverse\r\nrows of plates, and is attached along only the middle line of the back\r\nand beneath it the body is covered with silky, white fur; the rump is\r\ncovered with a solid shield of bone, placed nearly vertically and covered\r\nwith thin scales, and is notched below for the tail, altogether a most\r\nexceptional arrangement. Seven or more distinct genera of armadillos are\r\nfound in the Neotropical region and they display a great range in size;\r\nthe Giant Armadillo of Brazil (_Priodontes_) is a yard or more in length,\r\nwhile the little _Zaëdyus_ of Patagonia is smaller than a rabbit and,\r\nleast of all, the Pichiciago is but five inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.—Nine-banded Armadillo (_Tatu novemcinctus_).—By\r\npermission of the N.Y. Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\nTwo families of marsupials occur in South America. The opossums are\r\nmuch more numerous and varied than in North America; three genera and a\r\nlarge number of species, some not larger than mice, range through the\r\nforested parts of the continent. Of particular interest is the little\r\n_Cænolestes_, which has two species, with two enlarged lower front\r\nteeth, the sole survivors of a group which is abundantly represented in\r\nthe Tertiary deposits of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the Central American subregion is less rich and\r\ncharacteristic than that of the Brazilian and is, to a certain extent,\r\ntransitional to that of the Sonoran region of North America, several\r\ngenera proper to the latter region extending into it, which are not known\r\nto pass the Isthmus of Panama, such as shrews, a fox and one of the\r\npocket-mice. The West Indian islands are exceedingly poor in mammals,\r\na great contrast to the East Indian, or Malay, Archipelago; only a few\r\nrodents, insectivores and bats occur in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SUCCESSIVE MAMMALIAN FAUNAS OF NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural method of telling a story is to begin at the beginning and\r\ngo on to the end, but to deal in that manner with the many different\r\nassemblages of mammals which have in turn inhabited the western\r\nhemisphere has the great drawback of beginning with a time when\r\neverything was utterly strange to the modern eye. Could the reader be\r\ncarried back to the far distant days of the Paleocene epoch, he would\r\nfind himself in a completely unfamiliar world; and there is therefore a\r\nreal practical advantage in reversing the story and starting with the end\r\nand thus proceeding gradually from the more to the less familiar. The\r\nforegoing chapter gave a sketch of the more striking and characteristic\r\nmammals which inhabit the Americas to-day, and we may now take a step\r\nbackward to the epoch immediately preceding our own, the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nAs was shown in Chapter V, the Pleistocene was a time of many and great\r\nclimatic vicissitudes, periods of cold, when the northern part of the\r\ncontinent was buried under great ice-sheets, alternating with far milder\r\nperiods, when the climate was much as at present, or even warmer. These\r\nclimatic changes necessitated many changes in the distribution of\r\nanimals and plants, increasing cold driving them southward, while the\r\nreturn of more genial conditions permitted the northward migration of\r\nsouthern forms. The effects of these changes of climate are still plainly\r\nvisible in the geographical arrangement of living beings in the northern\r\ncontinents and many anomalies of distribution, otherwise inexplicable,\r\nare thus made clear. Attention was long ago directed to the fact that\r\nthe tops of high mountains support a flora and fauna which, on the\r\nlowlands, will be found only hundreds, or even thousands, of miles to the\r\nnorthward. The plants which grow on the summits of the White Mountains\r\nof New Hampshire recur in Labrador, but not in the intervening area; the\r\nvegetation and animals of the high Alps are those of the Arctic regions,\r\nand many similar instances might be cited. Hooker and Darwin were the\r\nfirst to find a highly probable explanation of this curious phenomenon by\r\nreferring it to the climatic changes of the Pleistocene epoch. During the\r\nlast period of cold and glaciation, the northern plants and animals were\r\ndriven far to the south and occupied the lowlands along the ice-front and\r\nwell beyond it; when milder conditions gradually returned, the northern\r\nforms not only retreated northward, but also ascended the mountains,\r\nas the latter were freed from ice, and thus became cut off as isolated\r\ncolonies. The general explanation of “discontinuous distribution” (see\r\np. 138) is thus always the same, viz., that the intervening regions were\r\nonce occupied by the forms now so widely separated, which, for one reason\r\nor another, have vanished from the connecting areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. QUATERNARY FAUNAS\r\n\r\n_North America._—The Quaternary faunas of North America are extremely\r\ndifficult to correlate and place in chronological order, because, for\r\nthe most part, they are found in locally restricted areas, such as\r\ntar-pools, bogs, caverns and similar places. Professor Osborn has,\r\nhowever, succeeded in making an admirable arrangement, which, though it\r\nwill doubtless be corrected and expanded by future research, represents a\r\nmost important advance. Of the general problem he says: “The study of the\r\nmammals of the Quaternary has by no means progressed so far in America as\r\nin Europe; it will be many years before the faunistic succession can be\r\nworked out with such chronologic accuracy and precision as has at last\r\nbeen attained by European geologists and palæontologists.” According to\r\nOsborn’s arrangement, there are three principal successive Pleistocene\r\nfaunas, two of which appear to have coincided with interglacial stages,\r\nand the third with the last reëstablishment of glacial conditions on a\r\ngrand scale. Regarding the details of these faunas, there still remains\r\nmuch uncertainty, and consequently there will be no attempt made here to\r\ndo more than discriminate between the general Pleistocene assemblage, on\r\nthe one hand, and that of the last cold period, on the other. It must be\r\nemphasized that we are as yet unable to assert that all of the animals\r\nlisted together were actually living at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Pleistocene fossils already obtained give us a\r\nfairly adequate conception of the larger and more conspicuous mammals of\r\nthe time, but no doubt represent very incompletely the small and fragile\r\nforms. With all its gaps, however, the record is very impressive; “the\r\nearly and mid-Pleistocene life of North America is the grandest and most\r\nvaried assemblage of the entire Cenozoic Period [_i.e._ era] of our\r\ncontinent” (Osborn). There is the further advantage that the fossils\r\nhave been gathered over a very great area, extending from ocean to ocean\r\nand from Alaska to Central America. Thus, their wide geographical range\r\nrepresents nearly all parts of the continent and gives us information\r\nconcerning the mammals of the great forests, as well as of the great\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nThose divisions of the early and middle Pleistocene which enjoyed milder\r\nclimatic conditions had an assemblage of mammals which, from one point\r\nof view, seems very modern, for most of the genera, and even many of the\r\nspecies, which now inhabit North America, date back to that time. From\r\nthe geographical standpoint, however, this is a very strange fauna, for\r\nit contains so many animals now utterly foreign to North America, to find\r\nnear relatives of which we should have to go to Asia or South America.\r\nSome of these animals which now seem so exotic, such as the llamas,\r\ncamels and horses, were yet truly indigenous and were derived from a long\r\nline of ancestors which dwelt in this continent, but are now scattered\r\nabroad and extinct in their original home, while others were migrants\r\nthat for some unknown reason failed to maintain themselves. Others again\r\nare everywhere extinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.—Some of the more characteristic Pleistocene\r\nmammals, reduced to a uniform scale, with a pointer dog (in the frame)\r\nto show relative sizes.—1. †Columbian Elephant (_Elephas †columbi_).\r\n2. Giant †Ground-Sloth (_†Megalonyx jeffersoni_). 3. †Stag-Moose\r\n(_†Cervalces scotti_). 4. †American Mastodon (_†Mastodon americanus_).\r\n5. †Giant Beaver (_†Castoroides ohioensis_). 6. †Texas Horse (_Equus\r\n†scotti_). 7. †Sabre-tooth Tiger (_†Smilodon californicus_).]\r\n\r\nMost surprising, perhaps, in a North American landscape, is the presence\r\nof the Proboscidea, of which two very distinct kinds, the †mastodons and\r\nthe true elephants, are found together. Over nearly the whole of the\r\nUnited States and southern Canada, and even with sporadic occurrence in\r\nAlaska, ranged the †American Mastodon (_†Mastodon americanus_) which was\r\nrare in the plains, but very abundant in the forested regions, where it\r\npersisted till a very late period and was probably known to the early\r\nIndians. This animal, while nearly related to the true elephants, was\r\nyet quite different from them in appearance, as will be immediately\r\nseen on comparing 1 and 4, Fig. 113, p. 195. The most obvious external\r\ndifference was the comparative shortness of the legs in the †Mastodon,\r\nwhich did not exceed and seldom attained a height of 9 ft. 6 in. at the\r\nshoulder; the head also was lower and more flattened. The teeth were\r\nvery different from those of the elephants; the grinding teeth were much\r\nsmaller and simpler, being low-crowned and rooted and having three or\r\nfour high, transverse, enamel-covered crests, without cement. The tusks\r\nwere elephant-like except that in the male there was a single small tusk\r\nin the lower jaw, which cannot have been visible externally; this is a\r\nremnant of an earlier stage of development, when there were two large\r\ntusks in the lower as well as the upper jaw. The creature was covered\r\nwith long, coarse, dun-coloured hair; such hair has been found with some\r\nof the skeletons.\r\n\r\nOf true elephants, the North American Pleistocene had three species.\r\nMost interesting of these is the northern or Siberian †Mammoth (_Elephas\r\n†primigenius_), a late immigrant from northern Asia, which came in by\r\nway of Alaska, where Bering Land (as we may call the raised bed of Bering\r\nSea) connected it with Asia. The †Mammoth was abundant in Alaska, British\r\nColumbia and all across the northern United States to the Atlantic coast.\r\nHardly any fossil mammal is so well known as this, for the carcasses\r\nentombed in the frozen gravels of northern Siberia have preserved every\r\ndetail of structure. It is thus definitely known that the †Mammoth was\r\nwell adapted to a cold climate and was covered with a dense coat of wool\r\nbeneath an outer coating of long, coarse hair, while the contents of the\r\nstomach and the partially masticated food found in the mouth show that\r\nthe animal fed upon the same vegetation as grows in northern Siberia\r\nto-day. The grinding teeth were very high, cement-covered, and composed\r\nof many thin plates of enamel, dentine and cement, and were closely\r\nsimilar to those of the existing Indian Elephant (_E. maximus_). In size\r\nthis is the smallest of the three Pleistocene species, 9 feet at the\r\nshoulder. The †Mammoth was not peculiar to Siberia and North America, but\r\nextended also into Europe, where it was familiar to Palæolithic Man, as\r\nis attested by the spirited and lifelike carvings and cave-paintings of\r\nthat date. Thus, during some part of the Pleistocene, this species ranged\r\naround the entire northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the †Mammoth and in some cases hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom it, is the †Columbian Elephant (_E. †columbi_) which, however,\r\nattained a considerably larger size, as much as 11 feet, rivalling the\r\nlargest African elephants of the present time. The head was very high\r\nand had a curiously peaked appearance, and the tusks in old males curved\r\ninward, overlapping at the tips. From the likeness in teeth and skeleton\r\nto the †Mammoth, it may be inferred, though somewhat doubtfully, that\r\nthe †Columbian Elephant was clothed with hair, but not so heavily as the\r\n†Mammoth, which was a northern species, the Columbian form replacing\r\nit southward, and ranging over the whole United States, including\r\nFlorida and even throughout the table-land of Mexico. The areas of the\r\ntwo species overlapped along the northernmost United States, but are\r\nelsewhere distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.—Restoration of the †Columbian Elephant (_Elephas\r\n†columbi_) from a skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nA third species was the huge †Imperial Elephant (_E. †imperator_), the\r\nlargest of American forms, to which Osborn’s calculations give the almost\r\nincredible height of 13 ft. 6 in. This great creature was characterized\r\nnot only by its enormous stature, but also by the proportionately very\r\nlarge size of its grinding teeth, and was a survivor from the preceding\r\nPliocene epoch; it is not known to have passed beyond the middle\r\nPleistocene and was thus the first of the species to become extinct. In\r\ngeographical range, the †Imperial Elephant was a western form, extending\r\nfrom the Pacific coast almost to the Mississippi River, east of which it\r\nhas never been found, and from Nebraska southward to the City of Mexico.\r\nThe meaning of this distribution is probably that this elephant shunned\r\nthe forests and was especially adapted to a life on the open plains. Over\r\nmost of its area the winters were severe, and this fact makes it likely\r\nthat the animal was clothed with hair, but nothing is definitely known on\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.—A Horse (_Equus †scotti_) from the older\r\nPleistocene of Texas. Restored from a skeleton in the American Museum of\r\nNatural History.]\r\n\r\nMany other hoofed animals, far more than now inhabit North America, are\r\nfound in this Pleistocene fauna. The Perissodactyla were represented by\r\nhorses and tapirs, but not by rhinoceroses; it might seem superfluous\r\nto say that there were no rhinoceroses, but, as a matter of fact, that\r\nfamily had a long and varied American history and became extinct only\r\nduring or at the end of the Pliocene epoch. The horses were extremely\r\nnumerous, both individually and specifically, and ranged, apparently in\r\ngreat herds, all over Mexico and the United States and even into Alaska.\r\nAll the known species (at least ten in number) belong to the genus\r\n_Equus_, but the True Horse (_E. caballus_), to which all the domestic\r\nbreeds are referred, is not represented. The smallest known member of\r\nthe genus is the pygmy _E. †tau_ of Mexico. _E. †fraternus_, likewise a\r\nvery small species, is found especially in the southeast, but extended\r\nas far north as Pennsylvania and west to Nebraska. On the other hand,\r\n_E. †giganteus_ of Texas exceeded the heaviest modern draught-horses\r\nin size and was the largest of the American species; of other Texan\r\nforms, one (_E. †scotti_) resembled Burchell’s Zebra (_E. burchelli_)\r\nin the proportions of head and neck, body and limbs, while another (_E.\r\n†semiplicatus_) was more ass-like. The forest horse of the eastern states\r\nhas been named _E. †pectinatus_, an animal of moderate size. The Great\r\nPlains must have been fairly covered with enormous herds of horses, the\r\ncountless bones and teeth of which, entombed in the Sheridan formation,\r\nhave given to it the name of “Equus beds.” The most abundant of the\r\nplains species is _E. †complicatus_, a horse of about 14½ hands in height\r\n(_i.e._ 4 feet 10 inches at the shoulder) which also ranged down the\r\nMississippi Valley nearly or quite to the Gulf of Mexico. In California\r\nwas _E. †occidentalis_, equalling _E. †complicatus_ in size, but with\r\nmuch more simple teeth, and associated with it the much larger _E.\r\n†pacificus_, which was inferior only to _E. †giganteus_ and therefore the\r\nsecond largest of the American Pleistocene horses.\r\n\r\nTo one who knows nothing of the geological history of North America\r\nit would be natural to suppose that the Pleistocene horses must\r\nhave been immigrants from the Old World, which failed to establish\r\nthemselves permanently here, since they completely disappeared before\r\nthe discovery of the continent by Europeans. This would, however, be a\r\nmistaken inference, for North America was for long ages the chief area\r\nof development of the equine family, which may here be traced in almost\r\nunbroken continuity from the lower Eocene to the Pliocene. On the other\r\nhand, it is quite possible that some of the species were immigrants.\r\n\r\nTapirs, which are now confined to southern Asia, Central and South\r\nAmerica, were not uncommon in the forested parts of eastern North America\r\nas far north as Pennsylvania, but they have not been found west of the\r\nMississippi in the plains region. Two species are known, a larger and\r\nheavier one, _Tapirus †haysii_, and a smaller one which seems to be\r\nidentical with the living _T. terrestris_ of Central and South America.\r\nLike the horses, the tapirs had a long history of development in North\r\nAmerica and may well have originated here, but they withdrew from the\r\ncontinent in the Pleistocene, probably yielding to the last of the\r\nglacial advances.\r\n\r\nThere was likewise a much greater variety of Artiodactyla than North\r\nAmerica can boast at the present day; some were autochthonous, but, for\r\nthe most part, they were migrants from the eastern hemisphere, where the\r\ngreat group of the true ruminants (Pecora) passed through the greater\r\npart of its development and where its headquarters still are. Indigenous\r\nwere the peccaries, or American swine, which still occur from Texas south\r\nto Brazil. In Pleistocene time they ranged over nearly all of the United\r\nStates, as far northward as Pennsylvania, and across the plains to the\r\nPacific coast; they were represented by two genera, now extinct, one of\r\nwhich (_†Platygonus_) had crested grinding teeth and much longer legs\r\nthan the modern peccaries. Another indigenous group, strange as that may\r\nseem, is the suborder (Tylopoda) of the camels and llamas, both of which\r\nare represented in the North American Pleistocene, the descendants of a\r\nvery long American ancestry. Some of these tylopodans were far larger\r\nthan existing forms, and at least one species extended its range to\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\nOf ultimately Old World origin, but through a considerable line of\r\ndescent in America, were the typically American deer (_Odocoileus_)\r\nof which the Virginian and Black-tailed species are familiar modern\r\ninstances. Whether or not the Old World types, the Caribou (_Rangifer_)\r\nand Wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_) had reached the western hemisphere,\r\nis a matter of some doubt; if present at all, they must have been\r\ncomparatively rare. The Moose (_Alce americanus_), on the other hand,\r\nhad already appeared, but seems to have been confined to the western\r\nhalf of the continent, its presence in the east being questionable. The\r\nmistakenly named “Rocky Mountain Goat” (_Oreamnos montanus_), which is\r\nan antelope of the chamois group, was an apparently late arrival in the\r\nPleistocene, while the peculiar Prong-Buck (_Antilocapra americana_),\r\nwhich is very different from any of the Old World antelopes, was\r\npresent in the early part of the epoch. The descent of this remarkable\r\nanimal is still a problem, but not improbably it was derived from the\r\n“deer-antelopes” of the Miocene and Pliocene, the last of which occurred\r\nin the early Pleistocene. Mr. Gidley has announced the surprising\r\ndiscovery in Maryland of a large antelope hardly distinguishable from the\r\nAfrican Eland (_Taurotragus_). Other late arrivals from the Old World\r\nwere several forms allied to the existing Musk Ox (_Ovibos_), at least\r\ntwo genera of which (_†Preptoceras_ and _†Euceratherium_) have been found\r\nin California. A surprising number of species of _Bison_ occurred in the\r\nPleistocene, no less than seven of which are recognized as distinct,\r\nranging from Florida to Alaska. It is not likely that all these species\r\ncoexisted at the same time, but we cannot yet determine their order of\r\nsuccession, though the modern species, _B. bison_, was probably the\r\nlatest to arise. Most of these species were much larger than _B. bison_,\r\nand some were gigantic, such as _B. †latifrons_, which had a spread of\r\nhorns of 6 feet and is found through the Mississippi Valley, and _B.\r\n†crassicornis_ of Alaska.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.—Restoration of _†Preptoceras_, a musk-ox like\r\nanimal from the Californian Pleistocene. (From a skeleton in the museum\r\nof the University of California.)]\r\n\r\nPreying upon this great assemblage of hoofed animals was a corresponding\r\narray of Carnivora, most of which were indigenous and derived from\r\nAmerican stocks, but there was a considerable migrant element also,\r\nsuch as the bears and badgers. Nearly all the modern kinds of\r\nflesh-eaters found in the North America of to-day were already here\r\nin the Pleistocene, minks, weasels, martens, skunks, otters, badgers,\r\nwolverenes, raccoons, foxes, wolves, coyotes, pumas, etc., etc., but\r\nthere were several others which are either now extinct or no longer\r\nto be found in this continent. Of the extinct types much the most\r\nstriking were the several species of †sabre-tooth tigers (_†Smilodon_,\r\nsee Frontispiece) which have been found in the greater part of the\r\nUnited States and no doubt ranged over the whole. These were massive,\r\nshort-tailed and rather short-legged, but very muscular and powerful,\r\ncat-like animals, in which the upper canine teeth were converted into\r\ngreat, recurved, scimitar-like tusks. These large beasts of prey, which\r\nabout equalled the Leopard in height, but were far heavier, belonged\r\nto a group which, at one time or another, spread over nearly the whole\r\nworld and persisted much later and attained a larger size and higher\r\ndevelopment in the western hemisphere than in the eastern. They had a\r\nvery long American ancestry, from the lower Oligocene to the end of\r\nthe Pleistocene, but the place of their origin is still unknown. In\r\naddition to the pumas and lynxes, there were some very large true felines\r\n(_Felis †atrox_ and _F. †imperialis_), which closely resembled the Lion\r\n(_F. leo_) in size, appearance and structure, and have been found in\r\nCalifornia and the Mississippi Valley; probably these great cats were\r\nimmigrants, but they may represent a native development of Miocene and\r\nPliocene stock; the history of the family is too imperfect for a decision\r\nof this question.\r\n\r\nBesides coyotes and wolves which are indistinguishable from existing\r\nspecies, there were some very large wolves, now extinct, of which the\r\ncommonest and most widely distributed was _Canis †dirus_ (also called _C.\r\n†indianensis_) so abundant in the asphalts of southern California. Bears\r\nwere not so common in the middle Pleistocene and have not been found in\r\nthe older part of that epoch, though they probably had already reached\r\nNorth America from the Old World, where they originated. Their absence\r\nfrom the older Pleistocene (Equus Beds) may be accounted for by the fact\r\nthat those beds contain a fauna of the open plains, while bears are\r\nchiefly forest-living animals. An extinct type of the family is the group\r\nof species which constitute the †short-faced bears (_†Arctotherium_),\r\nvery large and powerful creatures, with remarkably shortened jaws, which\r\nhave been found from ocean to ocean. The smaller beasts of prey, badgers,\r\nweasels, etc., were, as intimated above, substantially the same as now.\r\n\r\nThe rodents of the Pleistocene were very nearly in their modern stage\r\nof development, most of the genera and many of the species surviving\r\nto present times. Just what members of the order were introduced from\r\nthe Old World, the imperfect and fragmentary history will not permit\r\nus to say, but some interesting South American immigrants should be\r\nnoted. One of these, the Capybara or so-called Water-Hog (_Hydrochærus\r\ncapybara_), the largest of existing rodents, failed to gain a permanent\r\nfoothold, but another South American form, the Short-tailed or Canada\r\nPorcupine (_Erethizon dorsatus_), common all over the United States in\r\nthe Pleistocene, has maintained itself to the present day. One especially\r\npeculiar form, not derived from South America or the Old World, is the\r\n†Giant Beaver (_†Castoroides_), one species of which, _†C. ohioensis_,\r\nwas as large as a Black Bear and occurred in the later Pleistocene, while\r\na smaller species (_†C. species indet._) is found in the more ancient\r\ndeposits of the epoch. In almost all respects _†Castoroides_ was simply\r\na gigantic beaver, but the grinding teeth were remarkably like those of\r\nthe South American Capybara (_Hydrochærus_), so much so that it has been\r\nmistakenly referred to the same family by some authorities.\r\n\r\nBy far the strangest elements of the Pleistocene faunas were the two\r\nsuborders of gigantic edentates, the _†Gravigrada_, or †ground-sloths,\r\nand the _†Glyptodontia_, which might well be called giant armadillos,\r\nif that name were not already in use for a living Brazilian animal.\r\nBoth suborders are completely extinct, but they long played a very\r\nconspicuous rôle in South America, where they originated and whence the\r\nNorth American representatives migrated. The †ground-sloths were great,\r\nunwieldy, herbivorous animals covered with long hair, and in one family\r\n(†Mylodontidæ) there was a close-set armour of pebble-like ossicles in\r\nthe skin, not visible externally; they walked upon the outer edges of\r\nthe feet, somewhat as the Ant-Bear (_Myrmecophaga_) uses his fore paws,\r\nand must have been very slow-moving creatures. Their enormous claws may\r\nhave served partly as weapons of defence and were doubtless used also\r\nto drag down branches of trees and to dig roots and tubers. Apparently,\r\nthe latest of these curious animals to survive was the very large\r\n_†Megalonyx_, which, it is interesting to note, was first discovered and\r\nnamed by Thomas Jefferson. The animals of this genus were very abundant\r\nin the forests east of the Mississippi River and on the Pacific coast,\r\nmuch less common in the plains region, where they would seem to have\r\nbeen confined to the wooded river valleys. The still more gigantic\r\n_†Megatherium_, which had a body as large as that of an elephant and much\r\nshorter, though more massive legs, was a southern animal and has not\r\nbeen found above South Carolina. _†Mylodon_, smaller and lighter than\r\nthe preceding genera, would seem to have entered the continent earlier\r\nand to have become extinct sooner; it ranged across the continent, but\r\nwas much commoner in the plains region and less so in the forested areas\r\nthan _†Megalonyx_, being no doubt better adapted to subsisting upon the\r\nvegetation of the plains and less dependent upon trees for food.\r\n\r\nThe †Glyptodonts were undoubtedly present in the North American\r\nPleistocene, but the remains which have been collected so far are very\r\nfragmentary and quite insufficient to give us a definite conception of\r\nthe number and variety of them. It will be better therefore to defer the\r\ndescription of these most curious creatures until the South American\r\nPleistocene is dealt with, as they were incomparably more varied and\r\ncharacteristic in that continent. In North America they have been found\r\nonly in Mexico and the southern United States.\r\n\r\nThe many and great climatic changes which took place in the Pleistocene\r\nled to very extensive migrations of mammals from one part of the\r\ncontinent to another, as the conditions of temperature and moisture\r\nchanged. In Interglacial stages, when the climate was much ameliorated,\r\nsouthern species spread far to the north, as when the †Mastodon ranged\r\ninto Alaska, and the Manatee, or Sea-Cow, of Florida waters, came up the\r\ncoast to New Jersey, while the increasing cold of oncoming glaciation\r\ncaused a reverse movement and drove northern and even Arctic forms far\r\nto the south. Thus, the Musk-Ox, the Caribou and the northern †Mammoth\r\ncame south beyond the Ohio and the Potomac, and the Walrus was found on\r\nthe South Atlantic coast. It is these migrations which give such a mixed\r\ncharacter to the Pleistocene faunas from the climatic point of view, as\r\nit is often very difficult to correlate or synchronize the fossiliferous\r\ndeposits with the Glacial and Interglacial stages, though this has been\r\ndefinitely accomplished in several very important instances.\r\n\r\nThe latest of the Pleistocene faunas is less completely known than those\r\nof the earlier and middle portions of the epoch, for but few localities\r\nhave yet been discovered with any extensive series of fossils. As worked\r\nout by Osborn, this fauna coincided with the last Glacial stage and was\r\na greatly reduced and impoverished assemblage as compared with those of\r\nthe middle and lower Pleistocene, though it is not safe to argue that all\r\nthe animals not found in this fauna were already extinct, for the known\r\nlist is still far too short to be entirely representative. The American\r\n†Mastodon (_†Mastodon americanus_, see p. 196) was still abundant in\r\nthe forested regions and was apparently able to withstand severe winter\r\ntemperatures, as certainly was the †Mammoth (_Elephas †primigenius_, see\r\np. 196), which was so abundant in the coldest part of Siberia and which\r\nextended south to the Potomac, presumably at this time. Horses were\r\nstill present in North America, though apparently in greatly diminished\r\nnumbers and variety. Tapirs have not been found, though they may have\r\nlingered on in the southern regions. The typically North American genus\r\nof deer (_Odocoileus_) was, of course, well represented, and Old World\r\ntypes had a much more southerly distribution than at present. The Caribou\r\n(_Rangifer caribou_) came down into Pennsylvania and Ohio, the Moose\r\n(_Alce americanus_) into Kentucky and Kansas, and the Wapiti (_Cervus\r\ncanadensis_) is reported as far south as Florida. A very remarkable\r\nanimal is the Stag-Moose (_†Cervalces scotti_), the best preserved\r\nskeleton of which is that in the museum of Princeton University. This was\r\nfound in a shell-marl beneath a peat-bog at Mt. Hermon, N. J., _north of\r\nthe great terminal moraine_, and therefore most probably this particular\r\nindividual dates from a time not earlier than the beginning of the final\r\nretreat of the ice.\r\n\r\n_†Cervalces_, as its name implies, was in some respects intermediate\r\nbetween the Stag (_Cervus_) and the Moose (_Alce_); in general\r\nproportions it most nearly resembled the latter, having a short neck,\r\nlong body and very long legs; but the skull differed in many respects\r\nfrom that of the Moose, especially in parts which show that the great,\r\ninflated snout and prehensile upper lip had no such development in the\r\nextinct as in the living form. The antlers were unique among the known\r\nmembers of the deer family, resembling those of the Moose, though much\r\nless palmated and with the addition of great trumpet-shaped plates.\r\nThe feet were large, almost as large as in the Caribou, and the whole\r\nstructure indicates an animal well fitted to travel through deep snows\r\nand flourish in severe winters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.—_†Cervalces scotti_: restored from a skeleton\r\nin the museum of Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nEven more typically northern than the Caribou were the Musk-Oxen,\r\nof which two genera occurred in the late Pleistocene. One of these,\r\n_†Symbos_, is extinct and was characterized by its short horns; the\r\nother, _Ovibos_, is the genus to which the existing species, _O.\r\nmoschatus_ and _O. wardi_, belong and is now confined to the extreme\r\nnorth of the continent, the Arctic islands and Greenland. The remains of\r\nMusk-Oxen have been found mostly along the great terminal moraine which\r\nmarks the front of the last ice-invasion, but they occurred also as\r\nfar south as Oklahoma, and in Utah they ranged far to the south of the\r\nice-front. Nothing could be more conclusive evidence of a climate much\r\ncolder than the modern one than the presence of Caribou and Musk-Oxen in\r\nthe United States and of the Walrus on the coast of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe smaller animals were much as they are now, differing only in range.\r\nThe †sabre-tooth tigers, the last of a most interesting line, persisted\r\nin the south, and an extinct genus of skunks has been discovered in\r\nArkansas, but otherwise the Carnivora were entirely modern in character.\r\nUnfortunately, these smaller animals are very incompletely known, much\r\nthe richest aggregation which has yet been found being that collected by\r\nMr. Brown in the Conard Fissure, Arkansas. From this collection Mr. Brown\r\nhas described thirty-seven genera and fifty-one species of mammals, of\r\nwhich four genera and twenty-four species are extinct. That is to say,\r\nless than one-ninth of the genera and one-half of the species represent\r\nextinct forms. Contrast this with the middle Pleistocene assemblage found\r\nin the Port Kennedy cavern in eastern Pennsylvania, of sixty-four species\r\nwith at least forty extinct ones.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing sketch, brief and imperfect as it necessarily is, makes\r\nit sufficiently plain that North America during the Pleistocene was far\r\nricher in mammalian life than it was when the continent was first settled\r\nby Europeans. When we make the proper allowance for the many forms which\r\nundoubtedly remain to be discovered and for those which may have vanished\r\nwithout leaving a trace behind them, the contrast becomes all the more\r\nstriking. Not only did Pleistocene North America have substantially all\r\nthe mammals that it now possesses, but it had many more. The lions and\r\n†sabre-tooth tigers, the gigantic †short-faced bears, the tapirs and\r\nmany varieties of horses, large and small, the camels and llamas, many\r\nspecies of bisons, some of enormous proportions, several forms allied to\r\nthe Musk-Ox, the elephants and †mastodons, the †giant beavers and South\r\nAmerican water-hogs, the huge †ground-sloths and †glyptodonts, have all\r\ndisappeared, leaving a continent, that, by contrast, is “zoölogically\r\nimpoverished.” The Pleistocene fauna was strangely mixed in character,\r\nthe free roads of migration bringing together Old World and South\r\nAmerican types, and mingling them with indigenous forms in a cosmopolitan\r\nassemblage.\r\n\r\nTurning to _South America_, we find in the pampas of Argentina a\r\nwonderful museum of Pleistocene mammals, such as occurs nowhere else in\r\nthe known world, and this is supplemented by the very rich collections\r\ngathered from the caverns of Brazil and from deposits of Ecuador and\r\nBolivia, and thus all the important regions of the continent, save the\r\nfar south, are well represented. These faunas are far stranger than the\r\ncorresponding ones of North America and differ more radically from those\r\nof modern times, since they include a much larger proportion of extinct\r\ntypes, and the extinctions have swept away not only species and genera,\r\nbut families and orders as well.\r\n\r\nThe South American Pleistocene assemblage of mammals is very clearly\r\ndivisible into two elements: (1) the immigrants from the north, which\r\nreached the southern continent in successive waves of migration, that\r\nhave left records of themselves as early as the older Pliocene, perhaps\r\neven the upper Miocene, and (2) the indigenous element, which had a very\r\nlong history of development in South America. To the immigrant class\r\nbelonged all of the Carnivora, which therefore resembled their North\r\nAmerican relatives, but were less varied in character. Of the bears,\r\nonly the huge, †short-faced kind (_†Arctotherium_, Fig. 275, p. 549)\r\nare known, and it is not likely that true bears existed except in the\r\nAndes, as is also the case to-day. Of the cat family, the †sabre-tooth\r\ntigers (_†Smilodon_) were as common in South America as in North, and,\r\nwhile there were no lions, there were large cats nearly allied to the\r\nJaguar and Puma, and smaller ones, like the Ocelot. The dogs were quite\r\nnumerously represented by species resembling closely the existing South\r\nAmerican fox-like wolves and the Bush-Dog (_Icticyon_) and, strange\r\nto say, by one which seems referable to the same genus (_Cyon_) as\r\nthe Dhole of India. The weasel family (Mustelidæ) were less numerous\r\nand varied than in the northern continent, as they still are; coatis\r\n(_Nasua_) and raccoons (_Procyon_) were abundant and one species of the\r\nlatter was much larger than any existing one; extinct species of skunk\r\n(_Conepatus_), tayra (_Tayra_) and otter (_Lutra_) were also present, but\r\nthe badgers, minks, martens and wolverenes were not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.—Some of the commoner Pampean mammals, reduced\r\nto a uniform scale, with a pointer dog (in the frame) to show the\r\nrelative sizes. 1. _†Dœdicurus clavicaudatus._ 2. _†Glyptodon clavipes_,\r\n†glyptodonts. 3. _†Macrauchenia patachonica_, one of the †Litopterna.\r\n4. †Pampas Horse (_†Hippidion neogæum_). 5. _†Toxodon burmeisteri_,\r\na †toxodont. 6. _†Megatherium americanum_. 7. _†Mylodon robustus_,\r\n†ground-sloths.]\r\n\r\nThe hoofed animals were represented by a great variety of forms, both\r\nimmigrant and indigenous, of which the latter belonged to orders now\r\nentirely extinct. Horses were common in all parts of the continent, where\r\nfossils of this epoch have been obtained, and are referable to two very\r\ndistinct groups: (1) to the typical genus _Equus_, of which three species\r\nhave been described, all somewhat more primitive than the True Horse (_E.\r\ncaballus_) and, like most of the Pleistocene species of North America,\r\nwith a certain resemblance to the zebras and asses; (2) to an extinct\r\ngroup of four genera, the best known of which is _†Hippidion_. The\r\nspecies of this genus (which has also been reported from North America,\r\nthough upon hardly sufficient evidence) had most exceptional characters\r\nin the skull, and the head was relatively large and clumsy, with narrow\r\nand very high facial region. The neck was comparatively short, the limbs\r\nheavy and the feet short. These animals can hardly have been very swift\r\nrunners. A very interesting member of this group is _†Hyperhippidium_, a\r\nsmall horse found in the Andes, with remarkably short feet, well adapted\r\nfor a mountain life. The only other perissodactyls were tapirs, which\r\nranged down to the Argentine pampas, much farther south than now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.—A Pampas Horse (_†Hippidion neogæum_). Restored\r\nfrom a skeleton in the National Museum, Buenos Aires.]\r\n\r\nThe Artiodactyla were much more varied; there were peccaries, many\r\nspecies of llamas, which then extended into Brazil, and were not\r\nconfined, as at present, to the colder portions of the continent.\r\nThere were also numerous deer, all of the South American type, and\r\ntwo different antelopes have been reported, though that family has\r\nno representatives in the southern continent now. Several species of\r\n†mastodons have been found in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia and elsewhere,\r\nbut none of the true elephants. Why the †mastodons were able to make\r\ntheir way into South America, while the elephants were not, is one of the\r\npuzzling questions of mammalian distribution to which no answer can be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nAll the preceding types of hoofed animals, the horses, tapirs, peccaries,\r\nllamas, deer, antelopes and †mastodons were migrants from the north, and\r\nfour of these, tapirs, peccaries, llamas and deer, were able to gain a\r\npermanent footing in South America and are more or less abundant there\r\nto-day, while the horses, antelopes and †mastodons failed to do so and\r\ndied out. In addition to these, there were the indigenous types, which\r\nare now extinct and have never been found outside of the Neotropical\r\nregion. An extremely peculiar creature, _†Macrauchenia_, was the last\r\nsurviving member of an order, the †Litopterna, which for ages played\r\na very important rôle in South America. _†Macrauchenia_ was a large\r\nanimal, somewhat larger and of much heavier build than a camel, to which\r\nit had a considerable, though entirely superficial, resemblance. The\r\nhead was relatively small and must have had quite a long proboscis; the\r\nneck was very long, suggesting that the animal browsed upon trees, which\r\nis also indicated by the character of the teeth; the legs were long\r\nand stout, the feet short and each provided with three toes. Another\r\ncurious creature was _†Typotherium_, from which is named the group of the\r\n†Typotheria, which some authorities regard as a suborder, while others\r\nassign to it a full ordinal rank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.—A Pampean †Litoptern (_†Macrauchenia\r\npatachonica_). Restored from a skeleton in the Museum of La Plata.]\r\n\r\nThe †Typotheres throughout the Tertiary period were among the most\r\nabundant and characteristic of the South American hoofed animals, and the\r\ngenus _†Typotherium_ was the last of a very long series and was an animal\r\nof moderate size, with chisel-shaped incisor teeth so like those of the\r\nrodents that the genus was long referred to that order. Finally, we have\r\n_†Toxodon_, type of the order †Toxodontia, a ponderous beast, as large as\r\na rhinoceros, which, there is some reason to think, was largely aquatic\r\nin its habits. The first species of this extraordinary creature was found\r\nby Charles Darwin, who says of it: “Perhaps one of the strangest animals\r\never discovered; in size it equalled an elephant or megatherium, but the\r\nstructure of its teeth, as Mr. Owen states, proves indisputably that\r\nit was intimately related to the Gnawers [_i.e._ Rodentia] ... in many\r\ndetails it is allied to the Pachydermata: judging from the position of\r\nits eyes, ears, and nostrils, it was probably aquatic, like the Dugong\r\nand Manatee, to which it is also allied.”[4] Modern views concerning\r\nthe relationships of _†Toxodon_ are very different from those advanced\r\nby Darwin, but he gives a vivid picture of its diverse likenesses.\r\nNeither _†Macrauchenia_, _†Typotherium_ nor _†Toxodon_ has been found\r\nin the Brazilian caverns, but this is no doubt due to the accidents of\r\npreservation, for the latter animal ranged north to Nicaragua.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.—A Pampean †Toxodont (_†Toxodon burmeisteri_).\r\nRestored from a skeleton in the La Plata Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe rodents likewise were partially of immigrant and partially of native\r\nstock. To the former belonged the few mice and rats and a meadow-mouse\r\n(_Microtus_), a group not represented in present-day South America, and\r\na rabbit. Very much more abundant and varied were the indigenous forms,\r\nall of which belonged to existing families and most of them to existing\r\ngenera; the tree-porcupines, cavies, agoutis, spiny-rats, vizcachas,\r\ncapybaras, coypus, etc., were abundantly represented, for the most part\r\nby extinct species.\r\n\r\nThe monkeys were of purely Neotropical type and several modern genera,\r\nsuch as _Cebus_ and _Callithrix_, and one very large extinct genus,\r\n_†Protopithecus_, of the same family, have been found in the caverns of\r\nBrazil, but not in the pampas of Argentina, which would seem to have been\r\na country of open plains.\r\n\r\nIn the South America of to-day one of the most striking and peculiar\r\nelements of the fauna is that formed by the Edentata, the sloths,\r\nanteaters and armadillos, and this was even more true of the same region\r\nin Pleistocene times. Anteaters and sloths are very scantily represented,\r\nbut this is merely an accident of preservation; armadillos, on the\r\nother hand, were very numerous both in Brazil and in Argentina, and, in\r\naddition to many modern genera, there were several which are no longer in\r\nexistence, such as _†Chlamydotherium_, which was a huge creature almost\r\nas large as a rhinoceros. Then there were the two extinct suborders of\r\nthe †glyptodonts (†Glyptodontia) and the †ground-sloths (†Gravigrada)\r\nwhich were astonishingly abundant in Argentina and which, as was shown in\r\na previous page (p. 205), were also well represented in North America.\r\n\r\nFew more fantastic-looking mammals than the †glyptodonts have ever been\r\nfound; the short, deep head, with its shield of thick, bony plates, the\r\nhuge carapace made up of innumerable plates of bone firmly united at\r\ntheir edges and without the movable bands of the armadillo carapace, the\r\nenormous tail-sheath, the short legs and massive feet with broad hoofs,\r\nmust have given these animals rather the appearance of gigantic tortoises\r\nthan of mammals. The †glyptodonts were especially numerous and varied\r\nin the Argentine pampas, and a stately array of them is mounted in the\r\nmuseums of La Plata and Buenos Aires; in length, they ranged from six to\r\ntwelve feet, including the tail. The skeleton and carapace did not differ\r\nvery greatly in appearance among the various genera, but there were great\r\ndifferences in the form and size of the bony sheath enclosing the tail.\r\nIn the genus _†Glyptodon_ the sheath was composed throughout of movable\r\noverlapping rings, with prominent spines on them; in _†Sclerocalyptus_\r\nthe hinder half of the sheath coalesced into a single piece, marked only\r\nby the elaborate ornamentation of the horny scales, while in _†Dœdicurus_\r\nthe end had a tremendous, club-like expansion, which must have been set\r\nwith great horn-like spines. The †glyptodonts were ponderous, slow-moving\r\nand inoffensive plant-feeders, almost invulnerable to attack, and\r\nprobably used their massive tails, which could be freely swung from side\r\nto side, as redoubtable weapons of defence, much as the alligator uses\r\nhis tail. In comparison with the bewildering variety in South America,\r\nthe few that made their way into North America were quite insignificant.\r\n\r\nMuch the same statement applies to the †ground-sloths, and though these\r\nranged far more widely through the northern continent than did the\r\n†glyptodonts, they were but few in comparison with the multitude which\r\ninhabited alike the forests of Brazil and the plains of the south. Two\r\nof the three genera of †ground-sloths which occur in the North American\r\nPleistocene, _†Megatherium_ and _†Mylodon_, are also found in South\r\nAmerica; and though _†Megalonyx_ has not yet been obtained there, the\r\nfamily of which it is a member was represented. In size, these creatures\r\nvaried from a tapir to an elephant, though all were much shorter-legged\r\nthan any elephant; the extremely massive tail, which the larger forms\r\nhad, served to support the huge body, when erected to tear down the\r\nbranches and leaves upon which these strange creatures fed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.—A gigantic Pampean †Ground-Sloth (_†Megatherium\r\namericanum_). Restored from a skeleton in the Museum of La Plata.]\r\n\r\nOpossums were extremely numerous, especially in the Brazilian caves,\r\nwhere in half a cubic foot of earth 400 jaws were collected.\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene mammalian fauna of South America was a mixture of modern\r\nforms with ancient, vanished types similar to that which we found in\r\nNorth America. The †ground-sloths and †glyptodonts, the †litopterns,\r\n†toxodonts and †typotheres, the antelopes, horses and †mastodons have all\r\ndisappeared from the continent, or vanished altogether from the face of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. TERTIARY FAUNAS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Pliocene_\r\n\r\n_North America._—No part of the Cenozoic history of North America is\r\nso imperfectly recorded and so unsatisfactorily known as that of the\r\nPliocene, and the later portion of that epoch is especially obscure. If\r\nthe Peace Creek formation of Florida is properly referred to the upper\r\nPliocene, it would show that the mammals of that time were substantially\r\nthe same as those of the early Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nThe only fauna, as yet discovered, which can be referred to the middle\r\nPliocene, is that of the Blanco beds of northwestern Texas, which have\r\nyielded but a scanty list of mostly ill-preserved fossils. Obviously,\r\nthese give us a very incomplete picture of the life of that time. The\r\ngreat †ground-sloths had already reached North America, and the genus\r\n_†Megalonyx_, so common in the forested areas of Pleistocene North\r\nAmerica, was perhaps already in existence. The †glyptodonts were likewise\r\nrepresented by one genus (_†Glyptotherium_) which was distinguished\r\nby the simple rings of the tail-sheath. No rodents have yet been found\r\nand only a few of the Carnivora, though a large cat, a musteline and a\r\nlarge “†bear-dog” are known. There were no true elephants, but several\r\nspecies of †mastodons, all of which were different from those of the\r\nPleistocene; and in some, grinding teeth, though still low-crowned, had\r\nbecome much larger and more complex, marking a stage of advance toward\r\nthe elephantine dentition. Horses of primitive type, the feet having\r\nthree functional toes instead of one, were relatively abundant. Very\r\nlarge llama-like animals were present, but nothing has been ascertained\r\nwith regard to the deer and antelopes of the time, and the only\r\nother representative of the Artiodactyla yet recovered is a peccary,\r\ninteresting as being a species of the genus (_†Platygonus_) which became\r\nso abundant and widespread in the Pleistocene. Scanty and incomplete as\r\nthis fauna is, it suffices to show that the middle Pliocene mammals were\r\nmuch more primitive than those of the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.—†Horned Gopher (_†Epigaulus hatcheri_), lower\r\nPliocene, Nebraska. Restored from a skeleton in the U.S. National Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the Snake Creek formation in western Nebraska and that\r\nof the presumably somewhat later beds of northwestern Nevada, which\r\nare referable to the lower Pliocene, may be considered together. The\r\nrodents, which are not very fully represented, were quite modern in\r\ncharacter and belonged mostly to extinct species of modern genera, such\r\nas hares, pocket-gophers, beavers, forerunners of the †Giant Beaver,\r\nmarmots, sewellels, etc. A remnant of a more ancient world, especially\r\ncharacteristic of the Miocene, is found in the remarkable burrowers,\r\nthe horned †mylagaulids which have been extinct since the lower\r\nPliocene. Carnivora were abundant, and members of all the families which\r\ninhabit North America to-day have been obtained; wolves, “†bear-dogs,”\r\n“†hyena-dogs” and forms like the Dhole of India were common. The terms\r\n“†bear-dogs” and “†hyena-dogs” are not to be understood as implying any\r\nrelationships of these animals to bears or hyenas, but merely a certain\r\nsuperficial resemblance; these were very large members of the dog family\r\n(Canidæ), now extinct. Mustelines, large and small, are found, and\r\npossibly some bears had already made their way from the Old World, but\r\nthis is still uncertain. †Sabre-tooth tigers and true cats, some as large\r\nas lions and one species fairly gigantic, were likewise characteristic\r\nof the time. There was a great wealth of horses, though the modern genus\r\n_Equus_ was not among them; all the genera are now extinct and all were\r\nthree-toed. Several distinct phyla were represented, some progressive and\r\nadvancing toward the modern forms, others conservative and stationary.\r\nBrowsing horses with low-crowned teeth, grazing horses with prismatic,\r\ncement-covered teeth, heavier and lighter, larger and smaller, must have\r\ncovered the plains and thronged the woods. Ancestral tapirs were present,\r\nthough far less common. A family which seems to be utterly exotic to\r\nNorth America, that of the rhinoceroses, was present, and of these there\r\nwere three or four series, mostly without horns, or with a very small\r\nhorn on the tip of the snout. The extremely aberrant perissodactyls\r\n(†Ancylopoda), in which the hoofs were converted into great claws,\r\nperhaps persisted, but the evidence is not conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe Artiodactyla were, for the most part, totally different from those\r\nof modern times, though several forms were ancestral to some now\r\nliving. Peccaries more primitive than the living genus were the only\r\nrepresentatives of the swine-like suborder; ancestral camels and llamas\r\nwere among the commonest of the hoofed animals and an extinct phylum,\r\nthat of the “†giraffe-camels” (_†Alticamelus_) continued over from the\r\nMiocene. The giraffe-camels are so called, not because of any actual\r\nrelationships with the giraffes, but on account of certain likenesses\r\nin the proportions of the animals compared. _†Alticamelus_ was a very\r\nlarge, camel-like creature, with remarkably elongate neck and limbs\r\nand comparatively small head, which no doubt resembled the giraffes in\r\nbrowsing upon trees which were above the reach of the ordinary camels and\r\nllamas of the time. It was the terminal member of a series, or phylum,\r\nwhich branched off from the main stock in Oligocene times and pursued a\r\ncourse of development which was independent of the principal series, but\r\ncuriously parallel with it.\r\n\r\nThe deer of the lower Pliocene were little, graceful creatures\r\n(_†Blastomeryx_) which had no antlers, but the males were armed with\r\nsabre-like upper canine tusks, so that they must have resembled the\r\nMusk-Deer of Tibet, but were smaller and more slender. The remarkable\r\ngroup of “†deer-antelopes,” now extinct, was represented by _†Merycodus_,\r\na dainty little creature, less than two feet high at the shoulder,\r\nwhich had the antlers and general appearance of a small deer, but the\r\nhigh-crowned grinding teeth which most antelopes have. True antelopes\r\nof two different lines were also present, though they are as yet known\r\nfrom little more than the bony horn-cores; of these, one is the\r\nflat-horned and the other the twisted-horned or strepsicerine type, such\r\nas is illustrated by the Eland and Kudu of modern Africa. The latter\r\nmay, however, be related to the peculiarly North American Prong-Buck\r\n(_Antilocapra_) and not to the strepsicerine antelopes of the Old\r\nWorld. The last survivors of an exclusively North American family, the\r\n†oreodonts, which were wonderfully numerous and varied from the upper\r\nEocene onward, are found here.\r\n\r\nThe †mastodons (_†Gomphotherium_) of this formation had well-developed\r\ntusks in the lower as well as in the upper jaw, and in one species the\r\nchin-region or symphysis of the lower jaw was greatly prolonged, an\r\nancient feature.\r\n\r\nThat the South American edentates had already reached the northern\r\ncontinent is sufficiently proved by remains of †ground-sloths, which\r\nare, however, too incomplete to permit identification of the genus.\r\n†Glyptodonts have not yet been found, but this fact does not demonstrate\r\nthat they had not accompanied the †ground-sloths in their migration,\r\nfor at no time did they range so far north as Nebraska or northwestern\r\nNevada, and the only mammal-bearing formation of lower Pliocene date\r\nknown in the south, the Alachua Clay of Florida, has yielded too scanty a\r\nlist of fossils to make its negative evidence at all conclusive on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe mammals of the middle and especially of the lower Pliocene were much\r\nstranger and more primitive than might be inferred from the foregoing\r\nbrief account. Except several of the Rodentia and perhaps one or two\r\nof the Carnivora, the _genera_ are all extinct and such familiar terms\r\nas horses, rhinoceroses, camels, etc., can be employed only in a very\r\ncomprehensive sense, as equivalent to families.\r\n\r\nThe Pliocene of _South America_ is involved in some obscurity; not\r\nthat there is any question as to the formations, or their order of\r\nsuccession, but there is much doubt as to the limits of the epoch both\r\nabove and below. The latest Pliocene fauna, that of the Tarija Valley\r\nin Bolivia, was essentially the same as that of the Pleistocene and\r\ncontained a similarly large proportion of migrant elements from the\r\nnorth, but it was evidently older and many of the species were different.\r\nThe two divisions of the Araucanian fauna, contained in the beds of\r\nCatamarca and Monte Hermoso respectively, are very much alike and need\r\nnot be given separate consideration. In one respect these presumably\r\nupper Pliocene faunas formed a very strong contrast to the mammalian\r\nassemblage of the Pleistocene, and that is in the quite insignificant\r\npart taken by the migrants from North America. Of the Carnivora there\r\nwere but two representatives, one referable to the raccoon family and\r\none to the dogs, while a hare and a small member of the Artiodactyla, of\r\nindeterminate family, complete the list of northern forms, though this\r\nlist will doubtless be extended by future discovery. The peccaries, deer,\r\nantelopes, tapirs, horses, †mastodons, cats, weasels, otters, squirrels,\r\nmice, etc. had not reached the southern continent, or were still so\r\nrare that remains of them have not been found. This rarity and relative\r\ninsignificance of the northern forms gave a very different aspect to the\r\nfauna.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the indigenous South American groups were very fully\r\nrepresented. Many kinds of opossums and a few large carnivorous types,\r\nmuch like the so-called Tasmanian Wolf (_Thylacynus_), were the remnants\r\nof a much larger assemblage of marsupials which inhabited South America\r\nin the Miocene. Of the Edentata, there were great abundance and variety,\r\nmany large †glyptodonts and some gigantic armadillos, as well as numerous\r\nexamples of normal size; the †ground-sloths, though somewhat smaller\r\nthan those of the Pleistocene, were mostly of gigantic size, and true\r\nor arboreal sloths (Tardigrada) have been reported. The very numerous\r\nrodents, with the exception of the intrusive hare, all belonged to\r\ntypically South American families. Some of the rodents were gigantic\r\nand one (_†Megamys_), a member of the Chinchilla family, was equal to a\r\nrhinoceros in size and the largest known representative of the order.\r\nEspecially characteristic was the abundance of the cavy family (Caviidæ).\r\n\r\nThe hoofed animals, with the single known exception of the immigrant\r\nartiodactyl, all belonged to the autochthonous orders, all of which\r\nare extinct at the present time. Forerunners of the extraordinary\r\ngenus _†Macrauchenia_, which was one of the most conspicuous elements\r\nof Pleistocene life, were quite common in the Pliocene and differed\r\nfrom the Pampean genus chiefly in their smaller size and less advanced\r\nspecialization. We find here also the last survivors of another family of\r\nthe †Litopterna, the †proterotheres (†Proterotheriidæ), which imitated\r\nthe horses in such a surprising manner that some authorities believe\r\nthem to have been actually related to those perissodactyls. The Monte\r\nHermoso genus (_†Epitherium_) had feet which were wonderfully, though\r\nbut superficially, like those of the three-toed horses. The †Toxodonta\r\nwere numerous and most of them were large, ponderous animals; one genus\r\n(_†Trigodon_) had the interesting peculiarity of a single median horn\r\non the forehead, much like that of a rhinoceros. Horned species were\r\nalways rare among the indigenous groups of South American ungulates, and\r\nall that have been discovered so far belonged to the †toxodonts. The\r\nremaining group, that of the †Typotheria, was also well represented,\r\nboth by larger and by very small forms, some no larger than a rabbit\r\n(_†Pachyrukhos_).\r\n\r\nThe presumably lower Pliocene (perhaps upper Miocene) fauna of the\r\nParaná formation is as yet known only from very fragmentary material.\r\nRepresentatives of the dogs, raccoons and bears have been reported, but\r\nthe identifications are doubtful; at all events, these would seem to\r\nhave been the most ancient of the northern immigrants. A considerable\r\nnumber of marsupials, both opossums and large predaceous types, have been\r\nfound. The rodents were very numerous, all belonging to South American\r\nfamilies and some of them very large. The edentates were gigantic\r\n†ground-sloths and †glyptodonts, with numerous armadillos of ordinary\r\nsize. The hoofed animals all belonged to the indigenous South American\r\norders, the predominant place being taken by the †toxodonts, some of\r\nwhich were large. There were many †typotheres, both of the larger and\r\nsmaller kinds. The †Litopterna were represented both by the horse-like\r\n†proterotheres and the long-necked †macrauchenids, the latter smaller and\r\nless specialized than those of the Pampean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.—Head of Horned †Toxodont (_†Trigodon gaudryi_).\r\nPliocene of Monte Hermoso. Restored from a skull in the Ameghino\r\ncollection.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Miocene_\r\n\r\n_North America._—Upper Miocene beds cover extensive areas of the Great\r\nPlains region and are scattered from Montana far into Mexico. The rich\r\nfauna is an outgrowth and development of that of the middle Miocene, with\r\nbut few immigrant additions and, on the other hand, passes so gradually\r\ninto that of the lower Pliocene, that any line of separation between\r\nthem is very difficult to draw. The rodents, numerous as they are among\r\nthe fossils, are almost certainly very incompletely represented in the\r\ncollections; the families are almost all still in existence, but nearly\r\nevery genus is extinct, and thus the vernacular names used to designate\r\nthem must be understood in a broad sense. Hares, mice, pocket-gophers,\r\nsquirrels, marmots, beavers and the extraordinary †mylagaulids were all\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nIn even more strongly marked sense must the broad meaning for the\r\nvernacular names of the other mammals be emphasized, for we have to deal\r\nalmost exclusively with extinct genera, which differed much from their\r\nmodern descendants. Many of the Carnivora have been obtained; there were\r\nnumerous dogs, some rivalling the largest of existing bears in size, true\r\nfelines and †sabre-tooth tigers, which were smaller and lighter animals\r\nthan the great beasts of the Pleistocene; weasels, martens, otters and\r\nraccoons, but no bears. The bears, a family of Old World origin, are\r\nnot certainly known in America before the Pleistocene, but had probably\r\nreached this continent in the Pliocene.\r\n\r\nAs is so very generally true, the commonest and best-preserved of the\r\nfossils are those of the hoofed animals. The †mastodons were of the\r\nfour-tusked kind (_†Gomphotherium_ or _†Trilophodon_), the skull and\r\nteeth of which differed so markedly from those of the true elephants.\r\nThe relatively small, low-crowned and simple grinding teeth were common\r\nto all the †mastodons, but the tusks were different from those of the\r\nlarger members of the group. The upper tusks were comparatively short\r\nand nearly straight and retained a band of enamel, while the lower tusks\r\nwere still shorter, chisel-shaped and so worn as to prove that they were\r\nregularly used, no doubt in cropping leaves; the shortness of these lower\r\ntusks was compensated for by the great elongation of the lower jaw. The\r\nhead was proportionately broad and low and, for Proboscidea, these were\r\nsmall animals, not more than five or six feet high at the shoulder.\r\nThe body, limbs and feet had already attained substantially their\r\nmodern grade of structure, advance among the Proboscidea being chiefly\r\nrestricted to the teeth and skull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.—_†Teleoceras fossiger_, a short-legged\r\nrhinoceros, with small nasal horn; lower Pliocene and upper Miocene of\r\nNebraska. Restored from a skeleton in the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory.]\r\n\r\nFour families of Perissodactyla were represented in the upper Miocene.\r\nThe rhinoceroses, which were very abundant, were present in considerable\r\nvariety; some were hornless, others had a single small horn on the end\r\nof the nose. Among these rhinoceroses there was much difference in\r\nbodily proportions, some being extremely heavy, with very short legs\r\nand feet, and these were the commonest, while others had longer legs and\r\nless massive bodies. Tapirs, on the contrary, would seem to have been\r\nscantily represented; at least, they are rare among the fossils. The\r\nextraordinary, aberrant †chalicotheres, perissodactyls with claws instead\r\nof hoofs, still persisted, but are far better known from the lower\r\nMiocene, in connection with which they will be described. The dominant\r\nperissodactyl family was that of the horses, of which no less than five\r\ngenera are already known. There were some with very low-crowned teeth,\r\nwhich must have fed principally by browsing upon leaves and such soft\r\ndiet; but the grazing kinds, which had high-crowned, cement-covered and\r\nvery complex grinding teeth, had come to the fore. Still retaining three\r\ntoes in each foot, with the middle toe so enlarged as to bear nearly the\r\nentire weight, save in snow or soft ground, these eminently cursorial\r\nanimals, which had the slender limbs of a deer, must have roamed the\r\nplains in great herds.\r\n\r\nStill commoner were the Artiodactyla. Many species of grazing camels,\r\nwhich were the predominant artiodactyl family in North America during\r\nupper Miocene times, were the ancestors both of the true camels of\r\nthe Old World and the South American llamas. †Giraffe-camels have not\r\nyet been found and no doubt they were much less abundant than in the\r\nmiddle Miocene, but that they had not completely disappeared is shown\r\nby their recurrence in the Pliocene. As compared with earlier ages, the\r\n†oreodonts had begun a rapid decline and had lost notably both in numbers\r\nand variety, but one most curious beast (_†Pronomotherium_, Fig. 197,\r\np. 375) marked the final step in the development of the short-faced,\r\nproboscis-bearing series, which may be traced back to its beginnings in\r\nthe Oligocene. In this wonderful creature the skull was so short and\r\ndeep as to suggest that of a gorilla or some other great ape. No other\r\nartiodactyls even approximate these later proboscis-bearing †oreodonts\r\nin the altogether exceptional form of the skull. Grazing †oreodonts\r\n(_†Merychyus_), of moderate and small size with high-crowned teeth,\r\nwere evidently quite common on the upper Miocene plains. The †hornless\r\ndeer and “†deer-antelopes” differed but little from those of the lower\r\nPliocene. Peccaries were fairly abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.—_†Procamelus elrodi_, a large camel from the\r\nupper Miocene. Restored from specimens in the Carnegie Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe upper Miocene fauna was especially characterized by the large number\r\nof mammals, belonging to several different orders, which had acquired the\r\nhigh-crowned, persistently growing pattern of grinding teeth. Many of the\r\nhorses, camels, ruminants and rodents displayed this structure, and, as\r\nwas first pointed out by Kowalevsky, the explanation is probably to be\r\nfound in the spread of grassy plains at the expense of the forests. On\r\naccount of the silica which they contain, the grasses are very abrasive\r\nand rapidly wear the teeth down. In adaptation to this new source of\r\nabundant and nutritious food, many kinds of mammals developed a form\r\nof tooth which was fitted to compensate by growth for the loss through\r\nabrasion.\r\n\r\nThe middle Miocene, small areas of which occur in Montana, eastern Oregon\r\nand northeastern Colorado, has received various local names, the typical\r\none being the Deep River of Montana. Very probably, these scattered\r\nareas are not strictly contemporaneous, but form a closely connected\r\nseries. That a land-connection with the eastern hemisphere existed, is\r\nmade clear by the appearance of several unmistakably Old World types of\r\nanimals and the beginnings of migration from South America are perhaps\r\nalso to be noted, though this cannot be positively stated. The evidence\r\nfor the South American connection is the finding in the middle Miocene of\r\nOregon of what are believed to be the earliest remains of †ground-sloths\r\nyet discovered in North America, but the material is too scanty for\r\naltogether certain determination.\r\n\r\nThe smaller animals are not very well represented in the middle\r\nMiocene faunas, as conditions appear to have been unfavourable to\r\ntheir preservation; something is known of them, nevertheless. The\r\nvery curious extinct family of rodents known as the †Mylagaulidæ, the\r\npresence of which was noted in the upper Miocene and lower Pliocene,\r\nfirst appeared here. These †mylagaulids, which were distantly related\r\nto the modern Sewellel (_Aplodontia rufa_), were characterized by the\r\ngreat enlargement and complication of one of the grinding teeth in\r\neach jaw and the consequent reduction of the others. One genus of this\r\nfamily, as in the Pliocene, had the peculiarity, unique among rodents, of\r\ndeveloping a large horn upon the nose, like a miniature rhinoceros. Among\r\nthe Carnivora, we find a great variety of dogs, large and small, all\r\nbelonging to extinct genera, as indeed is true of the other carnivores\r\nalso. True felines have been found, but as yet, none of the †sabre-tooth\r\nseries; the abundance of the latter, however, in both preceding and\r\nsucceeding formations, is sufficient proof that the discovery of them in\r\nthe middle Miocene is merely a question of time. Mustelines were present,\r\nand especially noteworthy is the appearance of the first American otters,\r\nimmigrants from the Old World.\r\n\r\nOf the hoofed animals, the most interesting are the Proboscidea, the\r\nmost ancient of which that are definitely determinable in America occur\r\nin this horizon. The place of origin and ancestry of these animals were\r\nlong exasperating puzzles. Appearing suddenly in the Miocene of Europe\r\nand North America, in which regions nothing was known that could, with\r\nany plausibility, be regarded as ancestral to them, they might as well\r\nhave dropped from the moon, for all that could be told concerning their\r\nhistory. The exploration of the Eocene and Oligocene beds of Egypt has\r\ndispelled the mystery and shown that Africa was the original home of the\r\ngroup, whence they gradually spread to every continent except Australia.\r\nLittle is known of these earliest American proboscideans, but they were\r\ndoubtless small †mastodons of the four-tusked type.\r\n\r\nAmong the Perissodactyla, the rhinoceroses were perhaps the most\r\nconspicuous; the native American stocks of this family appear to have\r\nmostly died out and to have been replaced by two or more phyla of\r\nimmigrants from the Old World, some of which were hornless, others had\r\na small horn on the tip of the nose and others again had a second and\r\nsmaller horn on the forehead. Tapirs, though unquestionably present, are\r\nrare as fossils and not well known. Several distinct phyla of horses\r\nmay be distinguished, which were like small ponies in size, but of more\r\nslender form; they were all three-toed, but there were marked differences\r\namong them with regard to the degree to which the middle toe (the\r\nthird of the original five) had been enlarged to carry the whole weight\r\nand the lateral toes (second and fourth) reduced to mere “dew-claws.”\r\nWhile browsing horses, with low-crowned teeth, still persisted in large\r\nnumbers, we find also the extremely interesting beginnings of the highly\r\ncomplex, cement-covered and high-crowned teeth of the grazing kinds. The\r\nclawed †chalicotheres were present, though very little is known about\r\nthem because of the fragmentary character of the remains.\r\n\r\nThe Artiodactyla were much more varied and abundant, though they did\r\nnot rival the great assemblage of these animals found in the European\r\nMiocene. Of the peccaries little more can be said than that they were\r\npresent in these faunas. The †oreodonts were very numerous, both\r\nindividually and generically; two stages of the proboscis-bearing kind\r\nare found here together, the older, long-faced genus (_†Promerycochœrus_)\r\nsurviving from the Oligocene, while the newer Miocene type was\r\nshort-faced and had a moderate proboscis (see Fig. 196, p. 373). Others\r\nhad more the proportions of peccaries and still others were very small\r\nand presumably aquatic in habits. Camels abounded, both the grazing kinds\r\nwhich were ancestral to the modern forms of South America and Asia, and\r\nthe great, browsing †giraffe-camels. The †hornless deer and the antlered\r\n†deer-antelopes were much like those of the Upper Miocene, slender and\r\ngraceful little creatures, and there were also considerably larger\r\nruminants (_†Dromomeryx_) with straight, simple and non-deciduous horns,\r\nwhich may be called antelopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.—Gigantic †giraffe-camel (_†Alticamelus altus_)\r\nfrom the middle Miocene of Colorado. Restored from specimens in the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nThe line of division between the lower Miocene and the uppermost\r\nOligocene is a very obscure and difficult one to draw. Personally, I\r\nprefer to begin the Miocene with the widespread formation of the Great\r\nPlains, which has been variously named Arikaree, Harrison, Rosebud,\r\netc., but this is a moot point. Concerning the lower part of these beds\r\nOsborn says: “They may be either: (1) Upper Oligocene or (2) transitional\r\nfrom Oligocene to Miocene, or (3) of pure Lower Miocene age.” The upper\r\ndivision is referred to the Miocene without question by any one, but\r\nfor the purposes of this rapid sketch it will be best to treat the two\r\nfaunas together. This many-named formation, for which the term _Arikaree_\r\nis here employed, as having priority, is found over extensive areas of\r\nSouth Dakota, northern Nebraska and central Wyoming. The fauna was almost\r\nentirely a development from that of the North American Oligocene, with\r\nvery little admixture of foreign elements, so that the land communication\r\nwith the eastern hemisphere must have been difficult. In this, as in\r\nmost of the Miocene formations, the smaller mammals are not fairly\r\nrepresented, and it is evident that much remains to be learned with\r\nregard to them; this is especially true of the upper division of this\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.—Most ancient American Antelope (_†Dromomeryx\r\nantilopina_), middle Miocene. Restored from specimens in the Carnegie\r\nMuseum and Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nThe rodents, which were fairly numerous, were directly continuous with\r\nthose of the upper Oligocene and included forms which were more or\r\nless distantly connected with the modern hares, squirrels, beavers,\r\nsewellels, pocket-gophers and kangaroo-rats. A few Insectivora of\r\ndoubtful reference have been found. Among the Carnivora there was also\r\nconsiderable variety: dogs, large and small, were abundant, but all of\r\nthem were decidedly primitive from the modern standpoint; the cats were\r\nrepresented both by the true felines, which were probably immigrants,\r\nand by the †sabre-tooth series. There were several large and powerful\r\nmustelines, or members of the weasel family, which were likewise\r\nimmigrants, one of which resembles in many ways the modern Wolverene\r\n(_Gulo_). Very interesting is the beginning of the raccoon family\r\n(Procyonidæ) or, at least, what is believed to be such, which arose from\r\na branch of the dogs; this most ancient of the raccoons was _†Phlaocyon_,\r\na small and slender animal.\r\n\r\nThe earliest traces of the Proboscidea in America have been reported\r\nfrom this formation, but the fragmentary specimens are inconclusive.\r\nThe Perissodactyla are among the commonest fossils. The rhinoceroses\r\nbelonged to native stocks, including both the horned and hornless forms.\r\nThe horned genus (_†Diceratherium_) differed from all other rhinoceroses\r\nin having a transverse _pair_ of horns on the nose, and the species\r\nof the lower Miocene were quite small and light; the hornless genus\r\n(_†Cænopus_) was a larger and heavier animal. Tapirs are rare as fossils\r\nand consequently not well known. While there were several kinds of\r\nhorses, they all agreed in having short-crowned and relatively simple\r\ngrinding teeth and three-toed feet; they were smaller and of lighter,\r\nmore slender build than those of the middle Miocene. The wonderful\r\naberrant perissodactyls with clawed feet, the †chalicotheres (suborder\r\n†Ancylopoda), appear to have been more abundant in the Arikaree than at\r\nany other time in North America, though their history in this continent\r\nextends from the middle Eocene to the lower Pliocene. _†Moropus_, the\r\nlower Miocene genus, was as grotesque a creature as could well be\r\nimagined and, in advance of experience, no one ever did imagine such a\r\nbeast. With rather small and somewhat horse-like head, long neck, long\r\nfore limbs and shorter hind limbs, these extraordinary animals united\r\nshort, three-toed feet, which were armed with enormous claws. The long\r\npersistence (to the Pleistocene of Asia) and wide geographical range\r\nof the †chalicotheres are sufficient evidence that their very unusual\r\nstructure must have been advantageous to them, but the problem of their\r\nhabits and mode of life is still unsolved. From the character of the\r\nteeth, the long neck and fore limbs, it may, however, be inferred that\r\nthey fed chiefly upon the leaves of trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.—The small, †paired-horned rhinoceros\r\n(_†Diceratherium cooki_) of the lower Miocene.

Restored from a skeleton in the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh.]\r\n\r\nEven more numerous and varied were the Artiodactyla. Peccaries of a\r\nprimitive sort were common, and we find the last of the series of “†giant\r\npigs,” which had been a very conspicuous group throughout the Oligocene.\r\nThe lower Miocene genus, _†Dinohyus_, was a monstrous beast, six feet\r\nor more in height, with formidable canine tusks and a very long head\r\nmade grotesque by bony excrescences upon the skull and jaws. For a pig,\r\nthe legs were very long and the feet slender, having but two toes. The\r\n†oreodonts were present in great numbers, both small and large forms;\r\nexcept for bodily stature and modifications of the head, they all\r\nlooked very much alike; _†Merycochœrus_, with its incipient proboscis,\r\nhere made its first appearance. The last representatives of a family\r\n(†Hypertragulidæ) of small and graceful artiodactyls are found in this\r\nformation. One of these (_†Syndyoceras_, _see_ Fig. 215, p. 403), an\r\nanimal considerably larger than the existing Musk-Deer, was in its way\r\neven more bizarre-looking than the †chalicotheres; with an antelope-like\r\nhead, it had four horns, one pair over the eyes, curving inward, and\r\na shorter pair, with outward curvature, on the muzzle. Another genus\r\n(_†Hypertragulus_) was very much smaller and very slender.\r\n\r\nThe camels were beginning to diversify and give rise to several phyla.\r\nOne of the genera (_†Protomeryx_), which did not much exceed a sheep\r\nin size, probably represented the main stock, which led to the camels\r\nand llamas of to-day. A second (_†Stenomylus_) was a still smaller\r\nanimal, with remarkably long and slender legs, and might be called a\r\n“gazelle-camel,” while a third (_†Oxydactylus_, _see_ Fig. 209, p. 392),\r\nwhich was larger and apparently the beginning of the †giraffe-camels,\r\nwas noteworthy for its long neck. All of these lower Miocene camels\r\nhad deer-like hoofs, the characteristic pad or cushion which gives\r\nsuch an exceptional appearance to the feet of modern llamas and camels\r\nnot being fully developed till a later period. A very important new\r\nelement in the North American fauna was the appearance of the first deer\r\n(_†Blastomeryx_), which came in the latter part of the Arikaree stage\r\nand were the forerunners of a renewed immigration from the Old World,\r\nwhich had been broken off during the upper Oligocene. This, however, is\r\na disputed point; Professor Osborn and Dr. Matthew believe that these\r\nanimals were truly indigenous and derived from a long line of American\r\nancestry. The same genus continued through the middle Miocene, as we have\r\nalready seen, and therefore no further description of it is called for.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the _South American_ Miocene are very doubtful. The Paraná\r\nformation, here regarded as lower Pliocene, may prove to be more properly\r\nreferable to the upper Miocene. No other upper Miocene is known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.—The †gazelle-camel (_†Stenomylus hitchcocki_)\r\nof the lower Miocene. Restored from skeletons in the Carnegie Museum,\r\nPittsburgh.]\r\n\r\nTo the earlier, probably middle, Miocene may be referred the wonderful\r\nSanta Cruz fauna of Patagonia. It is extremely difficult to convey to\r\nthe reader any adequate conception of this great assemblage of mammals,\r\nbecause most of them belonged to orders which have altogether vanished\r\nfrom the earth and are only remotely like the forms with which we are\r\nfamiliar in the northern hemisphere. To one who knows only these northern\r\nanimals, it seems like entering another world when he begins the study of\r\nthe Santa Cruz fossils. If any North American mammals had then entered\r\nSouth America, which is not probable, they had not extended their range\r\nas far as Patagonia. Marvellously rich and varied as the Santa Cruz fauna\r\nwas, it did not contain everything that we should expect to find in it;\r\nseveral recent families of undoubtedly indigenous South American origin\r\nhave left no ancestors in the early Miocene formations. For this, there\r\nare several obvious reasons. In part, these gaps in the history are\r\nmerely due to the accidents of collecting and some of them will almost\r\ncertainly be filled by future exploration. Other absentees will probably\r\nnever be found, because the Santa Cruz beds are known only in the very\r\nfar south, and the Miocene climate of the region, though much milder and\r\nmore genial than the present one, must have been unsuitable for many\r\ntropical animals. Again, the Patagonia of that time appears to have been\r\na country of open plains, with few trees, and hence arboreal forms were\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.—Diagram to illustrate the comparative sizes of\r\nthe Santa Cruz mammals, a modern pointer dog, within the rectangle, to\r\ngive the scale. 1. _†Cladosictis lustratus_, predaceous marsupial. 2.\r\n_†Protypotherium australe_, †typothere. 3. _†Eocardia excavata_, rodent.\r\n4. _†Stegotherium tesselatum_, armadillo. 5. _†Propalæohoplophorus\r\naustralis_, †glyptodont. 6. _†Hapalops longiceps_, †ground-sloth. 7.\r\n_†Thoatherium minusculum_, †litoptern. 8. _†Astrapotherium magnum_,\r\n†astrapothere. 9. _†Prothylacynus patagonicus_, predaceous marsupial.\r\n10. _†Theosodon garrettorum_, †litoptern. 11. _†Nesodon imbricatus_,\r\n†toxodont.]\r\n\r\nWhile great numbers of large, flightless birds, some of them of enormous\r\nsize, were entombed in the volcanic ash and dust which were spread\r\nover such wide areas and to such great depths, the extreme scarcity of\r\nreptiles is surprising; a few remains of lizards have been found, but no\r\nsnakes, crocodiles, or tortoises, and we have no information as to the\r\nplant-life of the region at that time. The mammals were almost all of\r\nsmall or moderate size; only one or two species were really large.\r\n\r\nOne very striking and characteristic feature of the Santa Cruz fauna is\r\nthe great abundance of marsupials which it contained and which resembled\r\nmore or less those of modern Australia. There were no true Carnivora and\r\ntheir places were taken by a variety of carnivorous marsupials, some\r\nof which (_e.g._ _†Prothylacynus_) were as large as wolves and were\r\nclosely similar to the so-called Tasmanian Wolf (_Thylacynus_). Another\r\ngenus (_†Borhyæna_) had a short, bullet head, not unlike a small Puma\r\nin appearance and, besides, there were many smaller beasts of prey, in\r\nsize like badgers and minks. Opossums were common and there were many\r\nvery small herbivorous marsupials, which resembled, though perhaps but\r\nsuperficially, the Australian phalangers. At the present day South\r\nAmerica contains no Insectivora, but in the Santa Cruz there was one\r\nfamily (†Necrolestidæ) of this order which bore considerable resemblance\r\nto the “golden moles” of South Africa. An extraordinary variety of\r\nrodents inhabited Patagonia in Santa Cruz times, all of them belonging\r\nto the Hystricomorpha, or porcupine suborder, and all referable to\r\nexisting South American families. There were none of the northern forms\r\nof rodents, neither rats, mice, squirrels, marmots, hares, nor rabbits,\r\nbut a very numerous assembly of tree-porcupines, cavies, chinchillas,\r\ncoypus and the like. The genera, though closely allied to existing ones,\r\nare all extinct, and the animals were very generally smaller than their\r\nmodern descendants. A few small monkeys of unmistakably Neotropical type\r\nhave been found, but like other arboreal and forest-living animals, they\r\nare very rare among the fossils.\r\n\r\nThe Edentata were more abundant and diversified than at any other time\r\nin South American history of which the record is preserved. Two of the\r\nmodern subdivisions of this order have not been certainly identified\r\nin the Santa Cruz collections, the arboreal sloths and the anteaters,\r\nand though they may be found there at any time, it will only be as\r\nstragglers from the warmer forested regions to the north, where these\r\nforms had doubtless long been present. Unfortunately, however, nothing\r\nis directly known concerning the life of those regions in Miocene\r\ntimes. On the other hand, three groups of edentates, two of them now\r\nextinct, were very copiously represented in the Santa Cruz formation,\r\nthe armadillos, †glyptodonts and †ground-sloths. Of the many armadillos,\r\nsome quite large, others very small, only a few can be regarded as\r\ndirectly ancestral to those now in existence; the truly ancestral\r\nforms were probably then living in the forests of Brazil and northern\r\nArgentina, in the same areas as the ancestral tree-sloths and anteaters.\r\nIn comparison with the giants of the Pliocene and Pleistocene, the Santa\r\nCruz †glyptodonts were all small, the carapace rarely exceeding two\r\nfeet in length, and, what it is particularly interesting to note, they\r\ndeparted much less widely from the armadillo type than did their gigantic\r\nsuccessors. The †ground-sloths were present in actually bewildering\r\nvariety and they also were very small as compared with the huge animals\r\nof the Pleistocene, none of them exceeding the Black Bear in height or\r\nlength, though proportionally much more massive, and many were no bigger\r\nthan foxes. They had small heads, long bodies, heavy tails and short,\r\nthick legs; their teeth show that they were plant-feeders, but their feet\r\nwere armed with long, sharp and formidable claws. Among this great host\r\nof Santa Cruz †ground-sloths may readily be noted the probable ancestors\r\nof the gigantic creatures which were such characteristic elements of the\r\nPliocene and Pleistocene faunas.\r\n\r\nThere was an extraordinarily rich and varied assemblage of hoofed\r\nanimals, all utterly different from those of the northern hemisphere and\r\nbelonging to groups which have never been found outside of South and\r\nCentral America. Of these groups there were five, which by different\r\nwriters are variously regarded as orders or suborders, a matter of very\r\nsecondary importance. Individually, the commonest of the hoofed mammals\r\nwere the †Toxodonta, which ranged in size from a sheep to a tapir,\r\nheavily built and clumsy creatures, with absurdly small, three-toed feet;\r\nin some of the species there was a small median horn on the forehead. As\r\nwith the †glyptodonts and †ground-sloths, the contrast in size between\r\nthe Santa Cruz ancestors and the Pleistocene descendants was very\r\nstriking. A very numerous and varied group was that of the †Typotheria,\r\nall small animals, some no larger than rabbits, others the size of\r\nsmall foxes. It requires a decided effort to think of these †typotheres\r\nas being really hoofed animals at all, as their whole appearance must\r\nhave been much more like that of rodents, yet their structure clearly\r\ndemonstrates their near relationship to the †toxodonts. Still a third\r\ngroup of the same series, the †Entelonychia, is of great interest, for,\r\nas in the †chalicotheres of the northern hemisphere, the hoofs had been\r\ntransformed into claws and their five-toed feet had a truly grotesque\r\nappearance, not diminished by the long and powerful limbs and relatively\r\nsmall head.\r\n\r\nThis is the third example of that paradoxical creature, a “hoofed animal”\r\nwith claws instead of hoofs, and in each of the three instances, there\r\nis every reason to believe, the transformation proceeded independently.\r\nAmong the perissodactyls the †chalicotheres (p. 238) underwent this\r\nchange; in North America the †Agriochœridæ, a family of artiodactyls,\r\nhad a very similar history, while in South America the †Entelonychia\r\narose from the same stock as the †toxodonts, with which they were nearly\r\nallied. They were among the largest animals of Santa Cruz times and\r\nranged in size from an ox to a rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThere was a fourth group, the †Astrapotheria, concerning which our\r\nknowledge is tantalizingly incomplete, some species of which were the\r\nlargest of known Santa Cruz mammals, while others were much smaller.\r\nThey had short, domed heads, with a considerable proboscis, and were\r\narmed with formidable tusks, which were the enlarged canine teeth, the\r\nonly known instance of large canine tusks among the indigenous South\r\nAmerican hoofed animals. The limbs were long and not very massive, the\r\nfeet short, five-toed and somewhat elephantine in appearance. These\r\nbizarre animals would seem to have held a rather isolated position among\r\nthe South American ungulates, and though they may be traced back to the\r\nmost ancient mammal-bearing beds of that continent, their relationships\r\nare still obscure; much more complete material must be obtained before\r\nthis problem can be definitely solved. Both the †Astrapotheria and the\r\n†Entelonychia died out shortly after the end of the Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nFrom many points of view the most interesting members of the Santa\r\nCruz fauna were the †Litopterna, an order which also went back to the\r\nearliest South American Tertiary. In the Miocene and Pliocene the order\r\nwas represented by two very distinct families, the †Macrauchenidæ and\r\n†Proterotheriidæ, which were superficially very unlike. In the Santa Cruz\r\nbeds is found a genus (_†Theosodon_) which was apparently the direct\r\nancestor of the Pampean _†Macrauchenia_. The Miocene genus was a much\r\nsmaller animal and had hardly more than an incipient proboscis, but\r\notherwise was very like its Pampean successor; it was somewhat larger and\r\nheavier than a Llama and probably bore some resemblance to that animal\r\nin appearance. The long, narrow head, with its prehensile upper lip,\r\nmust have had an almost reptilian likeness from the numerous uniform and\r\nsharp-pointed teeth with which the front of the jaws was supplied; the\r\nneck was elongate, the body short and rather slender and the legs long,\r\nending in three nearly equal toes.\r\n\r\nThe †proterotheres, on the other hand, were almost the only Santa Cruz\r\nungulates which had nothing _outré_ or grotesque about them to the eye of\r\none habituated to the faunas of the northern hemisphere. They were small,\r\ngraceful animals, very like the Miocene horses of the north in their\r\nproportions, though having much shorter necks and shorter, heavier heads.\r\nIn some genera of this family (_e.g._ _†Diadiaphorus_, _†Proterotherium_)\r\nthe feet were three-toed and most surprisingly horse-like in shape, but\r\none genus (_†Thoatherium_) was absolutely single-toed, more completely\r\nmonodactyl than any horse. The horse-likenesses ran all through the\r\nskeleton and are so numerous and so striking that several writers have\r\nnot hesitated to incorporate the †Litopterna with the Perissodactyla,\r\nbut this I believe to be an error. If the †proterotheres were not\r\nperissodactyls, as I am convinced they were not, they afford one of the\r\nmost remarkable examples of convergent evolution among mammals yet made\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Oligocene_\r\n\r\n_North America._—The John Day formation of eastern Oregon represents\r\nthe upper Oligocene and has yielded a very extensive series of mammals,\r\nthough with some obvious gaps that remain to be filled by future work.\r\nThe land-connection with the Old World which had existed in the lower\r\nOligocene and was restored in the lower, or at latest in the middle,\r\nMiocene, was interrupted in John Day times, and so the mammals assumed a\r\npurely indigenous character.\r\n\r\nNo opossums or other marsupials have been found, and nothing is known\r\nof the Insectivora. Of the Carnivora, there were but three families,\r\nand one of these, the mustelines, was represented but scantily by a\r\nfew small species. Cats of the †sabre-tooth subfamily were common and\r\none species was quite large, almost equalling the Jaguar in length;\r\nbut most of the species were small, much smaller than the Pleistocene\r\nmembers of the group. True cats are not definitely known to have been\r\npresent, but there were two genera (_†Nimravus_ and _†Archælurus_)\r\nwhich have been called the “false †sabre-tooths,” which may prove to be\r\nreferable to that series. The dogs, on the other hand, were remarkably\r\nnumerous and diversified, more so than ever before or since; none of\r\nthem was very large, the largest but little exceeding the Timber Wolf\r\nin size, and some were extremely small; but the number of distinct\r\ngenera and species and the differences among them are quite remarkable.\r\nBoth long and short-faced forms and early stages of the “†bear-dogs,”\r\nand “†hyena-dogs,” and ancestral forms of the wolves and dholes may\r\nbe distinguished, a truly wonderful assemblage. The rodents also were\r\nnumerous and varied, including ancient and extinct genera of the\r\nbeavers, squirrels, mice, pocket-gophers and hares and the earliest\r\ndistinguishable ancestors of the sewellels (Aplodontiidæ).\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the known John Day fauna was composed of artiodactyls\r\nand perissodactyls. The latter had suffered serious losses as compared\r\nwith the preceding or White River stage. Up to and through White River\r\ntimes the perissodactyls had held their own in actual diversity, though\r\nthe rise of the artiodactyls had put an end to the dominant position\r\nwhich they had maintained in the Eocene. With the John Day the actual\r\ndecline may be said to have begun. The rhinoceroses were represented\r\nchiefly by the †diceratheres, with a transverse pair of horns, some\r\nspecies of which were much larger than those of the lower Miocene.\r\nHornless rhinoceroses have not yet been certainly found, though there is\r\nevery reason to believe that they then existed, as they unquestionably\r\ndid both before and after. Tapirs occurred but rarely and the horses were\r\nindividually abundant, though in no great diversity; they were smaller\r\nand lighter than the horses of the lower Miocene. Enough has been found\r\nto demonstrate the presence of the clawed †chalicotheres, but not to show\r\nhow they differed from their immediate successors.\r\n\r\nIn the number of individuals, species, genera and families, the\r\nartiodactyls of the John Day much exceeded the perissodactyls. The\r\npeccaries were numerous, but smaller and more primitive than those of\r\nthe succeeding age, as were also the †giant pigs, or †entelodonts,\r\nbut the latter were very large. The peculiarly North American family\r\nof the †oreodonts was very numerously represented, and one genus\r\n(_†Promerycochœrus_), comprising animals not unlike the Wild Boar in size\r\nand shape, was the probable beginning of the series of proboscis-bearing\r\n†oreodonts, which led to such grotesque forms in the middle and upper\r\nMiocene. A family closely allied to the †oreodonts, and by many\r\nwriters included in the latter, is the very remarkable group of the\r\n†Agriochœridæ, which was distinguished by the long, stout and cat-like\r\ntail and by the possession of claws instead of hoofs. The family is not\r\nknown to have existed later than the John Day and no trace of it has been\r\nfound in the succeeding formations. The camels seem to be all comprised\r\nin a single genus (_†Protomeryx_) which was the same as that found in the\r\nlower Miocene. A very small and dainty little creature (_†Hypertragulus_)\r\nbelonged to another family, the relationships of which are not clear.\r\n\r\nTo the middle and lower Oligocene is referred the great White River\r\nformation of South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, etc., which is divisible\r\ninto three clearly marked substages. The White River contains the\r\nbest-known fauna of all of the North American Tertiaries, for collecting\r\nin these beds has been carried on for more than sixty years, and a\r\ngreater number of complete and nearly complete skeletons has been secured\r\nthan from any of the other formations. It is plainly evident that a\r\nland-connection existed with the Old World, which was interrupted in the\r\nJohn Day, as is shown by the intermigration of characteristic forms; but\r\nsome barrier, presumably climatic, prevented any complete interchange of\r\nmammals, and very many genera and even families remained confined to one\r\ncontinent or the other.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the White River fauna changes in accordance with the\r\ndirection from which it is approached. If one comes to the study of it\r\nfrom the Eocene, it displays a very modern aspect, given by the almost\r\ncomplete disappearance of the archaic groups of mammals and by the great\r\nmultiplication of genera and species belonging to the progressive orders.\r\nThese genera, it is true, are all extinct, but many of them stood in an\r\nancestral relationship to modern forms. On the other hand, if approached\r\nfrom the Miocene side, the White River mammals seem to be very ancient\r\nand primitive and very different from anything that now lives. We speak\r\nof horses and rhinoceroses, dogs and cats, in this fauna, but those\r\nterms can be employed only in a very wide and elastic sense to designate\r\nanimals more or less distantly allied to those of the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.—1. _†Archæotherium._ 2. Ancestral camel\r\n(_†Poëbrotherium_). 3. _†Merycoidodon._ 4. _†Agriochœrus._ 5.

Hornless rhinoceros (_†Cænopus_).]\r\n\r\nSeveral species of opossums, some of them very small, were the only\r\nmarsupials in North America then, as they are now. There was quite a\r\nvariety of Insectivora; some were survivals of a family that was abundant\r\nin the Eocene, others, like the hedgehogs, moles and shrews, were\r\nprobably immigrants. Here we find the last of a group (order or suborder)\r\nof ancient and primitive flesh-eaters, the †Creodonta, that had played a\r\ngreat rôle in the Eocene and Paleocene of North America and Europe. In\r\nWhite River times but a single family (†Hyænodontidæ), with two genera,\r\nremained of the Eocene host. One of these genera (_†Hemipsalodon_), a\r\nvery large beast of prey, which was almost identical with the Old World\r\ngenus _†Pterodon_, was confined to the lower substage of the White River\r\nbeds in the Northwest Territory of Canada; the other, _†Hyænodon_, which\r\nwas also an Old World form, was represented abundantly in the United\r\nStates by many species. In size, these species ranged from a small fox\r\nto a large wolf, but they all had disproportionately large heads, and\r\nsmall, weak feet, with blunt claws, so that they must have been very\r\ncurious-looking creatures and were probably carrion-feeders rather than\r\nactive catchers of prey. The White River members of the family were\r\nmigrants from the eastern hemisphere, for, though small and primitive\r\nrepresentatives of it occurred in the North American Eocene, as well as\r\nin the corresponding formations of Europe, the family appears to have\r\ndied out in America and to have been renewed by the Oligocene migration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.—White River †titanothere (_†Titanotherium\r\nrobustum_) reduced to the same scale as Fig. 133.]\r\n\r\nCoincident with this decline of the †creodonts and, no doubt, causally\r\nconnected with it, was the rise of the true Carnivora, which for the\r\nfirst time were numerous and were divisible into three distinct families.\r\nSmall and primitive representatives of the wolves (_†Daphœnus_) and\r\npossibly also of the foxes (_†Cynodictis_) were quite common, and there\r\nwere a few species of the musteline family, evidently immigrants and the\r\nmost ancient yet found in America. There were several species of the\r\n†sabre-tooth cats (_†Dinictis_ and _†Hoplophoneus_) all of which, except\r\nin the uppermost substage, were quite small, few of them exceeding the\r\nCanada Lynx in size. A much larger animal (_†Eusmilus_, also European)\r\nappeared in the latter part of the stage. None of the true cats, or\r\nfeline subfamily, has been obtained. Nothing is yet known of the time\r\nand place of origin of the †sabre-tooth series, for they appeared at\r\napproximately the same date in Europe and America, and in neither\r\ncontinent have any possible ancestors been found in preceding formations.\r\nThe problem is like that of the Proboscidea (_see_ p. 234), but Egypt\r\nhas given no help in the case of the †sabre-tooths, and, by a process\r\nof elimination, we reach the conclusion that these strange creatures\r\nprobably arose somewhere in Asia and sent out migrants eastward and\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\nThe Rodentia were fairly abundant and present a strange mixture\r\nof ancient and comparatively modern types. One very common genus\r\n(_†Ischyromys_), which was the last remnant of a family almost limited\r\nto the North American Eocene, was associated with the earliest American\r\nmice, arboreal and ground squirrels, beavers and rabbits; some, if not\r\nall, of these were immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe hoofed mammals were present in fairly bewildering variety, but were\r\nrestricted to the two orders of the Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla. The\r\nPerissodactyla, while they no longer had the relatively dominant position\r\nwhich they held in the middle Eocene (_see_ p. 270), had suffered no\r\nactual loss; and no less than seven families of them, or six by another\r\nscheme of classification, had members in the North America of White\r\nRiver times, a very notable difference from the present order of things,\r\nwhen there are but three families in the entire world, none of which\r\nenters North America. The Eocene family of the †titanotheres became\r\nextinct at the end of the lower substage of the White River, but in that\r\nsubstage there was a marvellous abundance of these huge beasts, some of\r\nwhich were of almost elephantine stature and bulk. The pair of great\r\nbony, horn-like protuberances on the nose varied much in size and form\r\nin the different species, short to very long, triangular, cylindrical,\r\nflattened and shovel-shaped, and gave these ungainly creatures somewhat\r\nthe appearance of strange and very large rhinoceroses. The †titanotheres\r\nwere a typically North American family, but sent migrants to the Old\r\nWorld, at least two species reaching southeastern Europe. Rhinoceroses\r\ntoo were extremely numerous and diversified throughout the stage and are\r\nvery plainly divisible into three strongly contrasted series, which are\r\nsometimes regarded as three subdivisions of the same family and sometimes\r\nput into two separate families. One of these series, the †hyracodonts\r\n(_†Hyracodon_), was composed of small, long-necked and long-legged,\r\nslender and lightly built, cursorial animals, but with short, heavy\r\nheads, which gave them a somewhat clumsy look; having neither horns nor\r\ntusks, they were entirely defenceless and depended for their safety\r\nupon speed alone. The second series, or †amynodonts (_†Metamynodon_),\r\nformed the very antithesis of the first,—large, heavy, short-necked, and\r\nshort-legged and probably amphibious in manner of life, they were armed\r\nwith formidable tusks; and their skulls were so curiously modified as\r\nto bear a distinct resemblance to the skull of a huge carnivore. The\r\n†amynodonts migrated to the Old World and occur in the Oligocene of\r\nFrance, but the †hyracodonts would seem never to have left North America.\r\nThe third series, that of the true rhinoceroses, comprised several genera\r\nat different levels in the White River beds (_†Trigonias_, _†Cænopus_,\r\netc.); they were of uncertain origin and it has not yet been determined\r\nwhether they were immigrants or of native stock. Many species have been\r\nfound, varying much in size, up to that of a modern tapir, and not unlike\r\none in proportions, for they were of lighter build and had relatively\r\nlonger legs than any existing rhinoceros. The species of the lower\r\nand middle substages were all hornless, but in the uppermost substage\r\nwe find skulls with a pair of nasal horns in an incipient stage of\r\ndevelopment. This was the beginning of the †paired-horned rhinoceroses\r\n(_†Diceratherium_) which so flourished in the John Day and the lower\r\nMiocene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.—†Hornless rhinoceros (_†Cænopus tridactylus_)\r\nof the White River stage. Restored from a skeleton in the American\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nOf the horses there was no great variety and all the species so far\r\ndiscovered are included in a single genus (_†Mesohippus_), though there\r\nwas a decided increment in the size of the successive species from the\r\nearlier to the later portion of the stage. Looked at superficially, it\r\nseems absurd to call these little creatures “horses” at all and the term\r\ncan be justified only as implying that they were ancestral members of the\r\nfamily. The largest of the White River species hardly exceeded a sheep in\r\nsize and all of them had comparatively short necks, long and slender legs\r\nand three-toed feet. The low-crowned grinding teeth show that they were\r\nbrowsers, not grazers. The abundant Eocene family of the †Lophiodontidæ\r\nmade its last appearance in the White River, where it was scantily\r\nrepresented by slender, long-legged animals (_†Colodon_), with feet\r\nsingularly like those of the contemporary horses, except that there were\r\nfour toes in the front foot. Tapirs (_†Protapirus_) were very much less\r\ncommon than rhinoceroses or horses and were hardly half as large as the\r\nexisting species of the family and of relatively far more slender form;\r\nthe development of the proboscis had already begun. Lastly, the presence\r\nof the clawed †chalicotheres has been reported from the lower Oligocene\r\nof Canada, but the material is too fragmentary for generic reference.\r\n\r\nThough the number of artiodactyl families yet identified among the White\r\nRiver fossils is no larger than that of the perissodactyl families,\r\nthe artiodactyls greatly preponderated in individual abundance. The\r\npeccaries, which were fairly common, resembled those of the John Day,\r\nbut were considerably smaller. Of the camels, there were two series,\r\none of which (_†Eotylopus_), lately described by Dr. Matthew, is of yet\r\nunknown significance, while the other (_†Poëbrotherium_) was apparently\r\nthe ancestor common to all the subsequent phyla of camels and llamas.\r\nThis extremely interesting genus had species which ranged in size from a\r\ngazelle to a sheep, had two toes in each foot, a moderately elongate neck\r\nand teeth which were beginning to assume the high-crowned character.\r\nFrom this it may be inferred that those animals were, partly at least,\r\nof grazing habit, which was rare among White River ungulates, most\r\nof which fed upon leaves and soft and succulent plants. An extinct\r\nfamily, the †Hypertragulidæ, were a greatly diversified group of dainty\r\nlittle creatures, one of which (_†Hypisodus_) was no larger than a\r\nrabbit and had high-crowned teeth. The other genera (_†Leptomeryx_,\r\n_†Hypertragulus_) must have resembled in form and proportions the tiny\r\nlittle chevrotains or “mouse-deer” of the East Indian islands. Late\r\nin the age arose a larger form of this family, nearly equalling the\r\nMusk-Deer in size, the extraordinary genus _†Protoceras_, which was,\r\nespecially the males, a grotesque object. The males had a pair of upper\r\ncanine tusks and two pairs of prominent long protuberances on the skull.\r\nThis, or some similar form, must have been the ancestor of the still more\r\nbizarre _†Syndyoceras_ of the lower Miocene.\r\n\r\nThe †oreodonts were by far the commonest of White River mammals, and\r\nevidently they roamed the woods and plains in great herds. There\r\nwere several species, larger and smaller, of the abundant genus\r\n(_†Merycoidodon_) but the largest did not surpass a modern peccary in\r\nsize and was somewhat like that animal in appearance, but had a shorter\r\nhead and much longer tail. In the upper substage appeared a very peculiar\r\ngenus of this family (_†Leptauchenia_), animals with short, deep, almost\r\nmonkey-like heads, and presumably aquatic in habits. The _†agriochœrids_\r\nwere very much less common; they may be described roughly as †oreodonts\r\nwith very long, cat-like tails and clawed feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.—_†Merycoidodon culbertsoni_, the most abundant\r\nof White River †oreodonts. Restored from a skeleton in the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nAll of the foregoing artiodactyl families were exclusively North\r\nAmerican in Oligocene distribution; even the camels did not reach\r\nAsia till the Pliocene, and the other families never invaded the Old\r\nWorld at all. There were, however, two additional families, which also\r\noccurred in the eastern hemisphere, whence one of them, and possibly\r\nthe other, was derived. The unquestionably Old World family, that of\r\nthe †anthracotheres, was represented in the White River by two genera\r\n(_†Bothriodon_ and _†Anthracotherium_), which were short-legged,\r\nlong-snouted, swine-like animals, which have no near relations in the\r\nmodern world. The other family, the †giant pigs, which we have already\r\nmet with in the lower Miocene and upper Oligocene, is of doubtful origin,\r\nand nothing has yet been found in the preceding formations of either\r\nNorth America or Europe which can be regarded as ancestral to them. The\r\nWhite River genus (_†Archæotherium_) was very like the John Day and\r\nArikaree genera, but most of the species were much smaller and some were\r\nnot so large as a domestic pig. In the uppermost beds, however, are found\r\nhuge species, which rivalled those of the subsequent formations. That\r\nthese strange animals were rooters and diggers and therefore pig-like in\r\nhabits is indicated by the manner in which the teeth are worn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.—†Giant pig (_†Archæotherium ingens_) from\r\nthe lower White River stage. Restored from a skeleton in the museum of\r\nPrinceton University.]\r\n\r\n_South America._—The older continental Tertiary formations of South\r\nAmerica cannot be correlated with those of North America or Europe,\r\nbecause they have nothing in common. Difficult as it is to give a\r\ncorrect and adequate conception of the Tertiary mammalian life of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere to one who has not made a study of it, it is far more\r\ndifficult in the case of South America. The stock of adjectives, such\r\nas “peculiar,” “bizarre,” “grotesque” and the like, already overworked\r\nin dealing with northern forms, is quite hopelessly inadequate where\r\neverything is strange. In addition to this, we are seriously handicapped\r\nin treating of the Oligocene and Eocene of South America by very\r\nincomplete knowledge. Many fossils have been collected and named, but\r\nthe great majority of these are known only from teeth; a few skulls and\r\nlimb-bones have been described, but no skeletons, and therefore much is\r\nvery uncertain regarding these faunas.\r\n\r\nThe Deseado formation (Pyrotherium Beds) has been variously referred by\r\ndifferent writers from the upper Cretaceous to the lower Miocene, but\r\nits most probable correlation is with the Oligocene. Though most of the\r\nmammalian groups are the same as those of the Santa Cruz, the proportions\r\nof the various orders in the two faunas are very different, but, to some\r\nextent, the difference is probably illusory and due to the conditions\r\nof fossilization, for, as a rule, the small mammals are much less\r\nfrequent and well preserved in the older beds. As in the Santa Cruz, the\r\nmarsupials were the only predaceous mammals, and some of them attained\r\ngigantic size; but no such variety of these beasts of prey has been found\r\nin these beds as occurred in the middle Miocene. In addition, there\r\nwere numerous small herbivorous marsupials. One of the most striking\r\ndifferences from the Santa Cruz fauna was in the very much smaller number\r\nof Edentata, which, instead of being extremely common, are quite rare\r\namong the fossils. No doubt there was a real and substantial difference\r\nin this respect, but it was probably not so great as it seems, and\r\nthe same three suborders are found in both formations. One of the few\r\n†ground-sloths that have been obtained was very large (_†Octodontherium\r\ncrassidens_), a much larger animal than any species of the suborder that\r\nis known from the Santa Cruz. The †glyptodonts were also rare, and only\r\ntwo genera and species have been described from very scanty remains.\r\nArmadillos, on the other hand, were much more common, and no less than\r\neleven genera have been named, three of which occurred also in the Santa\r\nCruz. Among these was the remarkable genus _†Peltephilus_, in which\r\nthe anterior two pairs of plates of the head shield were modified into\r\nhorn-like spines.\r\n\r\nEqually striking was the remarkable diminution of the Rodentia, as\r\ncompared with those of the Santa Cruz, though, of course, this is an\r\ninaccurate mode of stating the truth, occasioned by the fact that we are\r\nfollowing the history in reverse order. It would be preferable to say\r\nthat the rodents underwent a remarkable expansion in the Santa Cruz.\r\nThese rodents of the Deseado stage are the most ancient yet discovered\r\nin South America and represent only two families, both belonging to\r\nthe Hystricomorpha, or porcupine group. If, as Dr. Schlosser and\r\nother European palæontologists maintain, the Hystricomorpha were all\r\nderived from a family of the European Eocene, this would necessitate a\r\nland-connection between South America and the Old World independent of\r\nNorth America, for the latter continent had no hystricomorph rodents\r\nuntil the connection between the two Americas was established.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the Deseado fauna is made up, so far as individual\r\nabundance is concerned, of hoofed animals belonging to the typically\r\nSouth American groups. The †Toxodonta were represented partly by\r\ngenera which were the direct ancestors of the common Santa Cruz\r\ngenera (_†Pronesodon_, _†Proadinotherium_), and, more numerously, by\r\na very peculiar family, the †Notohippidæ, which had highly complex,\r\ncement-covered grinding teeth. Still a third family of this suborder,\r\nthe †Leontiniidæ, was highly characteristic of the Deseado fauna and\r\nis not known from the Santa Cruz. These were large animals, with a\r\nsmall horn on the tip of the nose and low-crowned, comparatively simple\r\ngrinding teeth. Even more abundant were the †Typotheria, small forms\r\nwhich were ancestral to the Santa Cruz genera, larger ones which died out\r\nwithout leaving successors and one quite large animal (_†Eutrachytherus_)\r\nwhich seems to have been the ancestor of the Pliocene and Pleistocene\r\n_†Typotherium_. This series is not known to have been represented in\r\nthe Santa Cruz and may have withdrawn from Patagonia at the end of the\r\nDeseado stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.—Horned †toxodont (_†Leontinia gaudryi_), Deseado\r\nstage. Restored from a skull in the Ameghino collection.]\r\n\r\nThe †Entelonychia, those strange toxodont-like animals with claws instead\r\nof hoofs, were much more numerous and varied than they were afterward in\r\nthe Santa Cruz, when they were on the verge of extinction, and included\r\nboth very small and very large species. The †Pyrotheria, a suborder which\r\nis not met with in the Santa Cruz or later formations, likewise included\r\nsome very large forms. The typical genus, _†Pyrotherium_, included large,\r\nrelatively short-legged and very massive animals; the upper incisors\r\nformed two pairs of short, downwardly directed tusks, and in the lower\r\njaw was a single pair of horizontally directed tusks; the grinding teeth\r\nwere low-crowned and had each two simple, transverse crests. These\r\ngrinding teeth and the lower tusks so resemble those of the ancestral\r\nProboscidea in the Oligocene of Egypt, that the †pyrotheres have actually\r\nbeen regarded as the beginnings of the †mastodons and elephants, but this\r\nis undoubtedly an error. The †Astrapotheria, another group which became\r\nextinct at or soon after the end of the Santa Cruz, were relatively\r\nabundant in the Deseado and counted some very large species. Finally,\r\nthe †Litopterna were represented by the same two families as continued\r\nthrough the Pliocene and one of them far into the Pleistocene. The\r\nhorse-like †proterotheres were present, but not enough of them has been\r\nobtained to show whether or not they were in a notably less advanced\r\nstage of development than those of the Santa Cruz. The †macrauchenids\r\nwere quite similar to those of the latter formation, though considerably\r\nsmaller. In addition, there were a few genera, survivals from earlier\r\ntimes, which were not referable to either of these families.\r\n\r\nThe large number of genera, especially among the †toxodonts and\r\n†typotheres, which had high-crowned, cement-covered teeth, may be taken\r\nas an indication that grazing habits had already begun to be prevalent.\r\n\r\nOf this wonderful assemblage of hoofed animals, divisible into six\r\nseparate groups, whether of ordinal or subordinal rank, not a trace\r\nremains to-day. Not only are all the species, genera and families\r\nextinct, but the suborders and orders also. Further, this was a very\r\nstrictly autochthonous fauna, so far as the hoofed animals were\r\nconcerned, and no member of any of the six groups has ever been found\r\noutside of the Neotropical region.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Eocene_\r\n\r\n_North America._—In the western interior of North America the Oligocene\r\nfollowed so gradually upon the Eocene, that there is great difficulty\r\nin demarcating them and much difference of opinion and practice obtains\r\nas to where the boundary line should be drawn. Not to depart too widely\r\nfrom the scheme used by Professor Osborn, the Uinta stage is here\r\ntreated as uppermost Eocene, though this is a debatable procedure. For\r\nseveral reasons, the extraordinarily interesting and significant Uinta\r\nfauna is far less completely known than that of the preceding Bridger\r\nand succeeding White River stages. For one thing, it has been much less\r\nthoroughly explored, and it may be confidently expected that future\r\nexploration will greatly enlarge our knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe smaller mammals of the Uinta are particularly ill-known. No\r\nInsectivora have yet been found, though this gap will assuredly be\r\nfilled; rodents are scanty in the collections and include only two\r\nfamilies, one the †ischyromyids, which were still common in the\r\nWhite River, the other of doubtful position, but not improbably to\r\nbe considered as the beginning of the pocket-gophers (Geomyidæ). The\r\narchaic flesh-eaters, or †Creodonta, were represented by two families,\r\none comprising smaller animals with somewhat cat-like, shearing\r\nteeth (†Oxyænidæ), the other, very large beasts with crushing teeth\r\n(†Mesonychidæ), neither of which continued into the White River. As\r\ncompared with the middle and lower Eocene, the †creodonts had greatly\r\ndiminished and, to replace them, the true Carnivora were beginning to\r\ncome in. As yet, however, only small and very primitive dog-like forms\r\nare known and no trace of †sabre-tooths or mustelines has been found.\r\nIndeed, it is very doubtful whether members of these families ever will\r\nbe found in the Uinta, for their presence in the succeeding White River\r\nwas probably due to immigration.\r\n\r\nThe Perissodactyla were the preponderant type of hoofed animals, and\r\nancestral forms of most of the White River genera have already been\r\nidentified. The †titanotheres (_†Diplacodon_, _†Protitanotherium_)\r\nwere much smaller and lighter than those of the lower White River and\r\nhad much shorter horns. The †hyracodonts, the lightly built, cursorial\r\nrhinoceroses, were represented by a genus (_†Triplopus_) which was\r\nsmaller and more slender than the White River form (_†Hyracodon_) and its\r\nteeth were of distinctly more primitive character. The heavy, massive\r\nand presumably aquatic †amynodonts (_†Amynodon_) were likewise smaller\r\nand less specialized than their descendants of the Oligocene. No member\r\nof the true rhinoceros series has yet been identified in the Uinta,\r\nbut there is some reason to think that they were nevertheless present.\r\nTapirs are distinctly indicated by certain fossils, but they are still\r\ntoo incompletely known to make possible any statement as to their degree\r\nof development. The horses (_†Epihippus_), like the other families\r\nmentioned, were much smaller and distinctly more primitive than their\r\nsuccessors in the Oligocene.\r\n\r\nThe Artiodactyla were, for the first time in the history of North\r\nAmerica, as numerous and as varied as the perissodactyls and, with the\r\nexception of the peccaries and †anthracotheres, representatives of\r\nall the White River families are known. The finding of the peccaries\r\nis merely a question of further exploration, but the †anthracotheres\r\nwere migrants from the Old World, and there is no likelihood that they\r\nwill be discovered in the Uinta at any future time. Fairly large,\r\npig-like animals, probably referable to the †giant-pigs or †entelodonts,\r\noccurred, but nothing has yet been found which can be considered as\r\nthe direct ancestor of the White River genus. As was true of the\r\nperissodactyls, the Uinta artiodactyls were nearly all much smaller and\r\nmore primitive than their Oligocene descendants and the differences are\r\nmost interesting from the evolutionary point of view. The ancestral\r\ncamel (_†Protylopus_) was a little creature no bigger than a fox-terrier,\r\nthough the †hypertragulids (_†Leptotragulus_) were as large as\r\n_†Leptomeryx_ and _†Hypertragulus_ of the White River. The most ancient\r\nknown members of the †oreodonts (_†Protoreodon_) and the †agriochœrids\r\n(_†Protagriochœrus_) are found in the Uinta.\r\n\r\nThe middle Eocene fauna, Bridger stage, though it passed upward very\r\ngradually into that of the Uinta, was yet, on the whole, very different\r\nfrom the latter. It was exclusively indigenous and so radically distinct\r\nfrom the mammals of corresponding date in Europe as to preclude the\r\npossibility of a land-bridge with that continent. In the lower Eocene,\r\nas will be shown in a subsequent page, the communication between the two\r\ncontinents was broadly open and the faunas of the two continents were\r\nmuch more closely similar than they have ever been since. It is really\r\nremarkable to see with what comparative rapidity the two regions, when\r\nsevered, developed different mammals under the operation of divergent\r\nevolution. Had the separation continued throughout the Tertiary and\r\nQuaternary periods, North America would now have been as peculiar\r\nzoölogically as South America is, a result which has been prevented by\r\nthe repeated renewal of the connection.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic features of the Bridger mammalian fauna were chiefly\r\ndue to the great expansion and diversification of certain families,\r\nwhich began their career at an earlier stage, and to the disappearance\r\nof many archaic groups which had marked the more ancient faunas. Other\r\narchaic groups, however, survived and even flourished in the Bridger,\r\nand of these it is particularly difficult to convey a correct notion\r\nto the reader, because they were so utterly unlike anything that now\r\nlives. One of these orders, the †Tæniodontia, which had so many points\r\nof resemblance to the †ground-sloths that several writers have not\r\nhesitated to include them in the Edentata, survived only into the older\r\nBridger, but the equally problematical †Tillodontia then reached their\r\nculmination, though they were not very numerous. Though not at all\r\nrelated to that group, the †tillodonts looked like huge rodents, with\r\ntheir chisel-like incisor teeth. There was a remarkable assemblage of\r\nInsectivora, more numerous and varied than in any subsequent formation,\r\nno less than six families being known. One of these somewhat doubtfully\r\nrepresented the moles and two others modern Asiatic groups. The very\r\nunexpected discovery of an armadillo in the Bridger has been reported,\r\nbut the propriety of referring this animal to the armadillos, or even\r\nto the edentates, has not yet been proved, and it would therefore be\r\npremature to discuss its significance. The only marsupials were opossums.\r\n\r\nSo far as our information extends, there were no true Carnivora in the\r\nBridger, all the beasts of prey of the time belonging to the archaic\r\n†Creodonta, which then reached their maximum development in numbers\r\nand diversity. One family (†Oxyænidæ) included large and powerful\r\nflesh-eaters, with cat-like dentition and short, rounded, lion-like\r\nheads, long bodies and tails and short, heavy limbs, giving them the\r\nproportions of otters. Another (the †Hyænodontidæ) comprised small,\r\nlong-headed, fox-like and weasel-like animals, which doubtless preyed\r\nupon small mammals and birds. A third family (†Mesonychidæ) was made\r\nup of moderate-sized, long-jawed creatures, which must have resembled,\r\nrather remotely, short-legged and long-tailed wolves and hyenas. Their\r\nhabits and mode of life are somewhat problematical, for their grinding\r\nteeth were blunt, not adapted to the shearing of flesh, and their claws\r\nwere broad, almost hoof-like. Such creatures could hardly have subsisted\r\nby the pursuit of living prey and were probably carrion-feeders and more\r\nor less omnivorous. The †Miacidæ, a family which connected the †creodonts\r\nand true carnivores and might almost equally well be placed in either\r\ngroup, were externally much like the small †hyænodonts, but were more\r\nefficiently equipped for the capture and devouring of prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.—A mesonychid †creodont (_†Dromocyon velox_)\r\nof the Bridger stage. Restored from a skeleton in the Museum of Yale\r\nUniversity.]\r\n\r\nOf the archaic and extinct orders of hoofed animals, the only one which\r\npersisted from earlier times into the Bridger and greatly flourished\r\nthere was the †Amblypoda, one family of which (†Uintatheriidæ) was\r\npreëminently characteristic of middle Eocene life, becoming very rare\r\nand then dying out in the upper Eocene. The †uintatheres of the Bridger\r\nunderwent considerable modification in size and appearance within the\r\nlimits of the stage, the larger and stranger species appearing toward\r\nthe end of the time. Most of these great creatures may fairly be called\r\ngigantic, for they equalled the largest modern rhinoceroses and smaller\r\nelephants in size. The body, limbs and feet were so elephantine in\r\ncharacter that they were once believed to be ancestral Proboscidea, but\r\nthe teeth and the fantastic skull were so radically different that this\r\nbelief was long ago abandoned. The upper canine teeth were converted, in\r\nthe males, into formidable spear-like or scimitar-like tusks, protected\r\nby great flange-shaped expansions of the lower jaw; bony knobs on the\r\nend of the nose probably supported a pair of dermal horns like those of a\r\nrhinoceros and, in addition, a pair of high, cylindrical, horn-like, bony\r\nprotuberances arose above the eyes and another, more massive pair, near\r\nthe back of the head. It would be difficult to imagine more extraordinary\r\ncreatures than the †uintatheres, which were the largest land-mammals of\r\ntheir time. The family was entirely confined to North America, no trace\r\nof them having been found in any other continent.\r\n\r\nWhile the backward and archaic orders, most of which have left no\r\ndescendants in the modern world, had thus a stately representation in\r\nBridger times, they were outnumbered in genera, species and individuals\r\nby the progressive orders, which are still in more or less flourishing\r\nexistence. The Primates, whether lemurs or monkeys, were numerous,\r\nand this, so far as is definitely known, was their last appearance in\r\nextra-tropical North America. They may at any time be found in the\r\nUinta, but there is small probability that they will ever turn up in\r\nthe White River or later formations. The many rodents all belonged to\r\nthe †ischyromyids, an extinct family which, there is much reason to\r\nbelieve, was ancestral to many families of the squirrel-like suborder of\r\nSciuromorpha. Most of them were species of a single genus (_†Paramys_)\r\nand varied in size from a mouse to a beaver, or even larger.\r\n\r\nThe Perissodactyla may be said, in one sense, to have reached their\r\nculmination in the Bridger; not that many of them, such as the horses\r\nand rhinoceroses, did not advance far beyond their state of development\r\nin the Eocene, but at no subsequent time did the order as a whole\r\npossess such dominating importance. There were five or six families\r\nof perissodactyls in the Bridger, and their remains are much the most\r\nabundant fossils found there. Individually, the commonest perissodactyls\r\nof the time were the †titanotheres, of which there were several genera\r\nand many species, differing chiefly in size and proportions, though the\r\nlargest hardly exceeded a modern tapir in stature and was not dissimilar\r\nin appearance. These Bridger †titanotheres were considerably smaller\r\nthan those of the Uinta and therefore very much more so than the White\r\nRiver forms; it was not till the latter stage that the family lived up\r\nto its name of “titanic beasts.” By far the commonest of the genera in\r\nthe middle and lower Bridger was _†Palæosyops_, which was hornless, while\r\nin the upper part of the beds are found genera (_e.g._ _†Manteoceras_\r\nand _†Dolichorhinus_) in which the horns were just beginning to appear.\r\nAnother extinct family, the †Lophiodontidæ, which was very abundant in\r\nthe European Eocene, formed a very subordinate element in this fauna and\r\nincluded a number of small tapiroid genera (_e.g._ _†Helaletes_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.—Some characteristic mammals of the Bridger\r\nEocene reduced to a uniform scale, with a pointer dog, in frame,\r\nfor comparison. 1. Primitive rhinoceros (_†Hyrachyus eximius_). 2.\r\n†Tritemnodon agilis. 3. _†Patriofelis ferox_, and 4, _†Dromocyon\r\nvelox_, †creodonts. 5. Primitive rodent (_†Paramys delicatior_). 6.\r\n_†Uintatherium alticeps._ 7. †Titanothere (_†Mesatirhinus superior_).]\r\n\r\nThe horses (_†Orohippus_) were very small and primitive creatures, no\r\nbigger than a fox, with four toes in the front foot and three in the\r\nhind. So completely different in appearance and proportions were these\r\nlittle animals from any of the modern horses, that it requires an effort\r\nof the imagination to think of them as belonging to the same family, and\r\nit is only by employing the family to designate a _genetic series_ that\r\nsuch a classification can be justified. The †hyracodonts, or cursorial\r\nrhinoceroses, were very abundantly represented by a number of small and\r\nmedium-sized animals (_†Hyrachyus_) which had less specialized teeth,\r\nshorter neck and limbs than their upper Eocene and Oligocene successors,\r\nand four toes in the front foot; one genus (_†Colonoceras_) had a\r\npair of nasal horns, but would seem to have died out without leaving\r\ndescendants. In the upper part of the beds is found the Uinta genus\r\n_†Triplopus_, with three-toed fore foot; and in the same division occurs\r\nanother Uinta genus, _†Amynodon_, the most ancient known species of the\r\nsupposedly aquatic rhinoceroses. True rhinoceroses, that is animals which\r\nwere directly ancestral to the modern members of the family, have not\r\nbeen identified and may not have been present in North America; that is\r\nstill an open question. Tapirs, all of them quite small, were relatively\r\ncommon, but are still very incompletely known. The earliest known members\r\nof the clawed †chalicotheres were of Bridger date.\r\n\r\nIt is worth remarking that, except a single genus in the upper and later\r\nportion of the stage (_†Triplopus_), all of the Bridger perissodactyls\r\nhad four toes in the front foot and three in the hind, while in the White\r\nRiver beds above the lowest substage the number three in both fore and\r\nhind feet was almost equally universal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most radical and striking differences between the Uinta and\r\nBridger faunas was the rarity of Artiodactyla in the latter, which is\r\nin almost equally strong contrast with their abundance in the middle\r\nEocene of Europe. Most significant of these rare Bridger artiodactyls\r\nwere the little creatures (_†Homacodon_), hardly so large as a domestic\r\ncat, which may fairly be regarded as a very early stage, if not the\r\nactual beginning, of the great camel family, which was destined to\r\nplay so conspicuous a part in the life of America, North and South.\r\nSmall pig-like animals (_†Helohyus_) which were no doubt ancestral\r\nto the peccaries, were fairly common and there were, in addition,\r\nrelatively large animals (_†Achænodon_) allied, but not ancestral, to the\r\n†giant-pigs of the Oligocene; some of these were considerably larger than\r\na full-grown Wild Boar (_Sus scrofa_).\r\n\r\nAmong all the many hoofed mammals of the Uinta and Bridger there was not\r\na single one that had the high-crowned, persistently growing teeth of\r\nthe grazers; all of them must have had browsing habits and have fed upon\r\nsuch soft vegetable tissue as did not rapidly abrade the teeth. The same\r\nstatement applies, _à fortiori_, to the stages antecedent to the Bridger\r\nand therefore to the entire Eocene and Paleocene. From these facts it may\r\nbe inferred that the grasses had not yet taken possession of wide areas.\r\nConcerning the Bridger fauna, Professor Osborn, who has done so much to\r\nelucidate it, says: “On the whole, it is a very imposing, diversified and\r\nwell-balanced fauna, with an equal distribution of arboreal, cursorial,\r\naquatic, fossorial, carnivorous and herbivorous types.”\r\n\r\nThe lower Eocene is divisible into two stages, in descending order, the\r\nWind River and Wasatch, both extensively exposed in central Wyoming. As\r\nwould be expected from its stratigraphical position, the Wind River\r\nfauna was largely transitional between that of the Bridger above and that\r\nof the Wasatch below. Unfortunately, the fossils are far less numerous\r\nthan those of the Bridger and not so well preserved, and therefore give\r\nus a less adequate conception of the life of that time. The archaic,\r\nnon-progressive orders were strongly represented, but already the\r\nprogressive groups were in a numerical majority of species; most of\r\nthese archaic orders may be most advantageously described in connection\r\nwith the Wasatch. Opossums were almost certainly present, though the\r\navailable specimens are too fragmentary for assured determination.\r\nThe †tillodonts, †tæniodonts and insectivores differed little from\r\nthe Wasatch representatives of these orders, except that the Bridger\r\n†tæniodont, _†Stylinodon_, which had rootless, persistently growing\r\nteeth, was associated with the Wasatch genus _†Calamodon_. On the other\r\nhand, the primitive flesh-eaters, or †creodonts, which were referable to\r\nWasatch families, were less numerous and varied and formed a mixture of\r\nBridger and Wasatch genera. The †Oxyænidæ, the family with cat-like teeth\r\nand head, had both the smaller Wasatch genus _†Oxyæna_ and the very large\r\nBridge _†Patriofelis_. Of the blunt-toothed †Mesonychidæ, one very large\r\nanimal (_†Pachyæna_) survived from the Wasatch. The small forms of the\r\nfamily †Hyænodontidæ were common, and there were numerous species of the\r\nprogressive family †Miacidæ.\r\n\r\nAmong the hoofed animals there were two of the antique orders which\r\nbecame extinct before the end of the Eocene, indeed, one of these groups,\r\nthe †Condylarthra, made its last appearance in the Wind River. This\r\nextremely primitive group, which, in a sense, connected the hoofed with\r\nthe clawed mammals, will be described under the more ancient faunas.\r\nThe other order, the †Amblypoda, was represented by two very different\r\nfamilies, one of which, the †uintatheres, was so flourishing in the\r\nBridger, where it formed the most characteristic and by far the most\r\nstriking element of the fauna. The Wind River genus (_†Bathyopsis_)\r\nwas a very much smaller animal than any of the Bridger forms and its\r\nhorn-like protuberances were in an incipient state, while in various\r\nother respects it was decidedly more primitive than its successors. The\r\nsecond family was represented by the genus _†Coryphodon_, which did\r\nnot survive into the Bridger, but was especially characteristic of the\r\nWasatch fauna, with which it will be described.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the progressive orders, we note that the rodents, lemurs\r\nand monkeys were very similar to those of the Bridger and belonged to\r\nthe same families, but were decidedly less numerous. This difference,\r\nhowever, may be rather apparent than real and due to the much more\r\nfavourable conditions for the preservation of small mammals in the middle\r\nEocene. Among the Perissodactyla, the horses were intermediate in size\r\nand structure between those of the Bridger and those of the Wasatch, but\r\nwere decidedly nearer to the latter. The †lophiodonts, so far as known,\r\nwere represented by a single genus (_†Heptodon_) which also occurred in\r\nthe Wasatch. The modest beginnings of the †titanotheres, the family which\r\nbecame so very conspicuous in the middle and upper Eocene and lowest\r\nOligocene, may be noted in the Wind River fauna, in which there were\r\ntwo genera. One of these (_†Eotitanops_), the very probable ancestor\r\nof all the subsequent genera, was quite small, about two-thirds the\r\nsize of a modern tapir, while the other (_†Lambdotherium_) was a much\r\nsmaller, lighter and more slender animal and apparently belonged to an\r\nabortive, short-lived phylum. Then, too, the first of the †hyracodonts,\r\nor cursorial rhinoceroses, made their appearance here in the genus\r\n_†Hyrachyus_, which was afterward so common in the Bridger.\r\n\r\nNo Artiodactyla have yet been found in the Wind River, though there can\r\nbe little doubt that they then inhabited North America, as they did both\r\nbefore and afterward.\r\n\r\nThe Wind River fauna was of so much less peculiar and isolated character\r\nthan that of the Bridger as to suggest a connection with the eastern\r\nhemisphere, a suggestion which is strengthened by the unheralded\r\nappearance of the †titanotheres and †hyracodonts, of which no forerunners\r\nhave been found in the Wasatch.\r\n\r\nThe lowest and most ancient of the Eocene faunas is that of the Wasatch\r\nformation, which is extensively developed in central and southern\r\nWyoming, Utah and New Mexico. The fauna of this stage is plainly\r\ndivisible into two groups: (1) those types which were the descendants of\r\nAmerican Paleocene mammals and were therefore indigenous, and (2) the\r\nimmigrants from other continents. The indigenous mammals, which almost\r\nall belonged to orders now extinct, few of which survived later than the\r\nEocene, must have given a very bizarre appearance to the assemblage,\r\nespecially as they were more numerous, varied and, for the most part,\r\nlarger and more conspicuous than the newcomers. Marsupials have not yet\r\nbeen found, but the occurrence of opossums in the Bridger and probably\r\nin the Wind River gives some reason to believe that they were in North\r\nAmerica during Wasatch times also. The †Tæniodontia, which bore a certain\r\nresemblance to South American edentates, had one pair of incisor teeth\r\nabove and below enlarged and chisel-shaped, somewhat like those of\r\nrodents. The †Tillodontia were much smaller than those of the Bridger,\r\nand their incisors were only beginning to take on the chisel-like form.\r\nInsectivora were quite abundant, and three, or perhaps four, families\r\nwere represented in the Wasatch; some of these resembled the modern\r\naquatic insectivores of the west African rivers and others were more like\r\nEuropean hedgehogs.\r\n\r\nThe flesh-eaters all belonged to the †Creodonta, and, though rather less\r\ndiversified than those of the Bridger, were yet relatively abundant.\r\nIn size, they ranged from little creatures not larger than a weasel up\r\nto truly enormous beasts, and differed, no doubt, largely in habits\r\nand manner of life. For the most part, the families were the same as\r\nthose of the Bridger †creodonts, but the genera all were different. The\r\n†oxyænids (_†Oxyæna_) were much smaller and lighter than the large and\r\nmassive representatives found in the middle Eocene, and their teeth were\r\nnot so cat-like. Another group of predaceous animals (_†Palæonictis_)\r\nwhich also inhabited Europe, but did not survive the lower Eocene\r\nin either continent, had short, broad and very cat-like heads. The\r\n†mesonychids were far larger than those of the Bridger, a departure from\r\nthe ordinary rule, and the several species of the common Wasatch genus\r\n(_†Pachyæna_) had grotesquely large heads. A family (†Arctocyonidæ),\r\nof very extensive geographical range and great antiquity, had its last\r\nrepresentatives here in a very curious animal (_†Anacodon_) which had the\r\nflat-crowned, tuberculated grinding teeth of the bears and the enlarged,\r\nscimitar-like upper canines of the †sabre-tooth cats. Such a combination\r\nseems utterly incongruous and no one would have ventured to predict\r\nit. The progressive family of †creodonts (†Miacidæ) was already quite\r\nnumerously represented, but only by small forms, which must have preyed\r\nupon small mammals, birds and lizards.\r\n\r\nTwo archaic orders of hoofed mammals were fairly numerous. One, the\r\n†Condylarthra, comprised quite small, five-toed animals, with long\r\ntails and short feet and extremely primitive in structure. A genus\r\n(_†Phenacodus_) of this order was long regarded as being ancestral to\r\nmost of the higher orders of ungulates, but this belief has proved to\r\nbe untenable. More numerous were the †Amblypoda, one genus of which\r\n(_†Coryphodon_), though persisting into the Wind River, was especially\r\ncharacteristic of the Wasatch. The †coryphodonts were the largest of\r\nlower Eocene mammals, and some of the species equalled a tapir or\r\nsmall rhinoceros in length and height, but had heavier limbs; as the\r\nskeleton conclusively shows, these must have been heavy, clumsy and\r\nexceptionally ugly brutes, with formidable tusks, large head, but\r\nrelatively more slender body, short and massive limbs and elephantine\r\nfeet. In appearance, these strange beasts were not altogether unlike\r\nthe Hippopotamus and were perhaps more or less amphibious in habits.\r\nThe other family of †Amblypoda, the †uintatheres, have not yet been\r\nregistered from the Wasatch, but they will undoubtedly be found there, as\r\nthey were unquestionably present at that time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.—_†Phenacodus primævus_, the best known Wasatch\r\nrepresentative of the †Condylarthra.

Restored from a skeleton in the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nAll of the preceding groups were of the archaic, non-progressive type\r\nand have long been extinct. With the sole exception of one †creodont\r\nfamily (†Miacidæ) and perhaps some of the insectivores, they have no\r\ndescendants or representatives in the modern world. All of them appear to\r\nhave been indigenous and derived from North American ancestors, though\r\nit is possible that a few were immigrants. We now turn to the orders\r\nwhich were more significant of the future, because they had within them\r\nthe potency of a far higher development. These progressive groups were\r\nall immigrants, coming to North America from some region which cannot\r\nyet be positively identified, but most probably was Asia. From the same\r\nregion and at a corresponding period of time Europe received many of the\r\nsame forms, and so many genera were at that time common to the latter\r\ncontinent and North America that a broad and easy way of intermigration\r\nmust have been open.\r\n\r\nOne of these immigrant orders, the Rodentia, the most ancient known\r\nmembers of which were these species from the North American Wasatch,\r\nwas represented by the same family (†Ischyromyidæ) and some of the same\r\ngenera (_†Paramys_, _†Sciuravus_) as throve also in the Bridger stage.\r\n\r\nThere were two orders of hoofed mammals, which were newcomers to the\r\nwestern world, Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla. Of the former was a genus\r\n(_†Eohippus_) of the most ancient American horses. These most interesting\r\nlittle animals, no larger than small foxes and domestic cats, would\r\nhardly be called horses, were it not for the long series of gradual and\r\nsuccessive modifications which led from _†Eohippus_ up to the modern\r\nhorses. The graceful little creatures had a short neck, curved back, and\r\nrelatively short, slender limbs, with four functional toes in the front\r\nfoot and three in the hind; and, though they differed from existing\r\nhorses in almost every detail of teeth and skeleton, there was something\r\nunmistakably equine about them. From the abundance of their remains it\r\nmay be inferred that herds of them swarmed in the forests and glades of\r\nWasatch times. The second perissodactyl family, the †Lophiodontidæ, which\r\ncomprised considerably larger animals, never attained to importance in\r\nAmerica, but flourished and became greatly diversified in Europe. What\r\nare believed to be the most ancient tapirs yet discovered (_†Systemodon_)\r\nwere individually very common in the Wasatch. This tapir was no larger\r\nthan a Coyote, had no proboscis and was so little like a tapir in outward\r\nappearance that an observer might well be pardoned for overlooking the\r\nrelationship; even the skeleton is of so indifferent a character that the\r\nreference of this genus to the tapirs cannot be positively made.\r\n\r\nOf equal significance for the future was the arrival of the Artiodactyla,\r\nof which there were members of three families in the Wasatch, though\r\nindividually they were much less common than the horses. These were\r\ngeologically the oldest known artiodactyls, Europe having yielded none\r\nof this date, and are still too imperfectly known to justify any very\r\npositive statements about them. One genus, however (_†Trigonolestes_),\r\ntiny little creatures, like rabbits in size, would seem to represent the\r\nbeginnings of the great ruminant tribe, now so very important a factor in\r\nthe life of the world. A second genus (_†Eohyus_), considerably larger,\r\nis very doubtfully referable to the pigs; while a third (_†Parahyus_),\r\nstill larger, was the first in the short-faced series of the\r\n†entelodonts, which persisted in ever increasing size through the whole\r\nEocene, but could hardly have been ancestral to the true †entelodonts,\r\nor †giant-pigs, of the Oligocene, the place and time of whose origin are\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nAnother immigrant order of great interest, since we ourselves belong\r\nto it, the Primates, made its first appearance in North America in the\r\nWasatch, but was not destined to long life or great importance in this\r\ncontinent, where it did not survive the Eocene. Several different kinds\r\nof small, lemur-like and monkey-like creatures dwelt in the tree-tops\r\nof the Wasatch forests. One genus (_†Anaptomorphus_) had a remarkable\r\nlikeness to the modern Tarsier (_Tarsius spectrum_) of the Malay\r\npeninsula and islands.\r\n\r\n_South America._—The Eocene of South America, referred by some writers to\r\nthe upper Cretaceous, is very incompletely and unsatisfactorily known.\r\nThe Casa Mayor formation (or Notostylops Beds), which has yielded a\r\ngreat variety of mammals, for the most part very fragmentary, probably\r\ncontains not one but several successive faunas which have not yet been\r\nfully discriminated, and that of the next succeeding Astraponotus Beds is\r\nstill but a scanty list. This list, however, includes the most ancient\r\n†glyptodonts yet discovered and the most ancient †astrapotheres in the\r\nnarrow sense of the term. The Astraponotus Beds may be either Eocene or\r\nOligocene in date.\r\n\r\nTaking the Casa Mayor faunas as a whole, they were a very numerous and\r\ndiversified assemblage of small mammals, without a single large one\r\namong them. There were no monkeys or rodents; otherwise, the orders\r\nwere in almost all cases the same as those which made up the Santa Cruz\r\nfauna. The marsupials were represented by the opossums and by several\r\nof the carnivorous kinds, the only beasts of prey that South America\r\nhad until the migrations from the north brought in the true Carnivora,\r\nlate in the Miocene or very early in the Pliocene. There were also\r\nnumerous small marsupials of peculiar type, of which the last living\r\nsurvivor is _Cænolestes_, of Ecuador. Throughout the stage, armadillos\r\nwere present in considerable variety, but are known only from the bony\r\nplates of the carapace, and therefore little can be determined as to\r\ntheir relationships to the modern families. Only a single and very\r\nproblematical genus of the †ground-sloths, which afterwards throve so\r\nmightily in the Miocene and Pliocene, has been obtained and that in the\r\nlater portion of the stage.\r\n\r\nThe orders of hoofed mammals were represented by many small animals,\r\nmost of which are known only from the teeth, which show these Casa Mayor\r\ngenera to have been far more primitive and less specialized than their\r\ndescendants in the Deseado and Santa Cruz stages. All of them had the\r\nlow-crowned grinding teeth of the browsers, and no grazers were then in\r\nexistence, so far as is known. No †toxodonts, in the more restricted\r\nsense of that term, have been found, but the two allied suborders of\r\nthe †Typotheria and †Entelonychia were numerously represented. Of the\r\nformer there were two families and of the latter three, which is more\r\nthan in the Deseado or Santa Cruz formations. One of the families of the\r\n†Entelonychia (†Notostylopidæ) consisted of very small, rodent-like\r\nanimals, with a pair of chisel-shaped incisors in upper and lower jaw,\r\nand a second family (†Homalodontotheriidæ) contained genera which would\r\nseem to have been directly ancestral to those of the Santa Cruz, but\r\nwere very much smaller than their successors. The very large and massive\r\n†Pyrotheria of the Deseado stage were represented by small animals,\r\nin which the grinding teeth had two pairs of conical tubercles, not\r\nyet united into transverse crests. Two families of the †astrapotheres,\r\nin the broad sense, were far smaller than their Oligocene and Miocene\r\ndescendants. To the †Litopterna are referred a number of genera, in which\r\nthe grinding teeth were tuberculated and had very imperfectly developed\r\ncrests, so as strongly to suggest the teeth of the †Condylarthra.\r\nHowever, until something is ascertained regarding the skeleton,\r\nespecially the feet, of these animals, their relationships will remain\r\nmore or less doubtful.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that these Casa Mayor faunas not only were made up\r\nexclusively of small animals, but also that they already were typically\r\nand characteristically South American and bore the stamp which remained\r\nessentially the same until the successive waves of migration from the\r\nnorth so greatly modified the composition of the Neotropical fauna. The\r\nabsence of rodents and monkeys and the comparative unimportance of the\r\nEdentata gave a somewhat different character to these ancient faunas from\r\nthose of the Santa Cruz and later formations.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Paleocene_\r\n\r\n_North America._—A very important discovery is one lately made by\r\nAmerican Museum parties of a formation intermediate between the Wasatch\r\nand Torrejon. The interesting fauna of these beds has not yet been\r\ndescribed, but it may be remarked that it contained none of the immigrant\r\norders.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the Paleocene was already very modern in character,\r\nand nearly all of the common forest-trees were represented by species\r\nwhich differed but slightly from those of the present. The grasses were\r\nalready in existence, but, there is good reason to believe, they had not\r\nattained to much importance and did not cover the plains and open spaces\r\nas they did in the Miocene and still continue to do. As the grasses\r\nafford the principal food-supply of so many grazing animals, the matter\r\nof their abundance and extension is a very significant one in the history\r\nof mammalian development, and, as we have already learned, eventually led\r\nto widespread and profound modifications of structure, especially of the\r\nteeth. While there is thus nothing very strange about the plant-world of\r\nPaleocene times, the higher animal life was almost totally different from\r\nthat of modern times and made up a most curious and bizarre assemblage,\r\nfrom which nearly all the familiar Recent types were absent. The reptiles\r\nhad been greatly impoverished by the world-wide and, as yet, unexplained\r\ndestruction which overtook them at the end of the Mesozoic era, but it is\r\npossible that in both North and South America a few of the huge Dinosaurs\r\nsurvived the decimation of the class. Very characteristic of the\r\nPaleocene in North America and Europe were large, lizard-like reptiles,\r\nallied to the New Zealand Tuatara, while crocodiles and tortoises\r\nabounded; snakes were present, but do not appear to have been very common.\r\n\r\nIt is the mammals which were the strangest element of Paleocene life,\r\nand our imaginary observer would find no creature that he had ever seen\r\nbefore. The difference from modern mammalian life was not merely one of\r\nspecies, genera or even families, but of orders, for only one, or at most\r\ntwo, of the orders now living were then to be found in North America, and\r\nboth of these (marsupials and insectivores) were primitive and archaic\r\ngroups, which seem like belated survivals in the modern world. There\r\nwere no rodents, or true carnivores, no lemurs, monkeys, artiodactyls,\r\nperissodactyls or proboscideans.\r\n\r\nIn the _Torrejon_, or upper Paleocene, there were many herbivorous\r\nmarsupials, with very complex grinding teeth and chisel-like incisors,\r\nbut no carnivorous or insectivorous members of the order have been found.\r\nInsectivora were present. Of the †creodonts, or primitive flesh-eaters,\r\nthere were no less than five families; the bear-like †Arctocyonidæ, which\r\ndied out in the Wasatch, were quite numerous, and the problematical\r\n†Mesonychidæ were much smaller and more primitive mammals than those of\r\nthe Eocene. Passing over two families which did not survive the Torrejon,\r\nwe may note the first of the †Miacidæ, the progressive family which led\r\neventually to the true Carnivora. The hoofed animals all belonged to\r\nthe archaic †Condylarthra and †Amblypoda; of the former there were many\r\ngenera and species referable to three families, one of which contained\r\nthe forerunners of the Wasatch _†Phenacodus_. The genus _†Pantolambda_ of\r\nthe Amblypoda may well have been ancestral to both the †coryphodonts and\r\nthe †uintatheres of the Eocene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.—The Torrejon forerunner (_†Pantolambda\r\nbathmodon_) of _†Coryphodon_. Restored from a skeleton in the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nThe _Puerco_ fauna was much like that of the Torrejon, but even less\r\nadvanced and diversified. The herbivorous marsupials were more abundant,\r\nand some of them (_†Polymastodon_) larger than those of the Torrejon;\r\nInsectivora may have been present, but this is doubtful. The †creodonts,\r\nso far as they have been discovered, were less numerous, varied and\r\nspecialized than those of the Torrejon and included but one of the\r\nfamilies which passed over into the Eocene. The †Condylarthra were much\r\nless common and the †Amblypoda but doubtfully represented, but the\r\nedentate-like †Tæniodontia were conspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.—Head of an †allotherian marsupial\r\n(_†Polymastodon taöensis_) from the Puerco stage. Restored from a skull\r\nin the American Museum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nNot only were the Paleocene faunas radically different from the mammals\r\nof our time, but they could not have been ancestral to the latter, being\r\nhardly more than an advanced and diversified Mesozoic assemblage. It is\r\ntrue that some of its elements, such as the †Condylarthra, †Amblypoda\r\nand †Creodonta, developed greatly and played an important part in the\r\nlife of the Eocene, but of these only a few †creodonts continued into the\r\nOligocene and all became extinct without leaving any descendants behind\r\nthem. Another curious fact concerning the Paleocene mammalian faunas is\r\nthat they were made up entirely of small and very small animals; not a\r\nsingle mammal as large as a sheep has yet been found in these beds, and\r\nthe same is true of Europe.\r\n\r\nThat a land-connection with the Old World existed during the Paleocene\r\nepoch, is indicated by the similarity of the faunas of North America and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE PERISSODACTYLA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn attempting to trace the evolutionary history of the various mammalian\r\ngroups, it is necessary to bear in mind the inevitable limitations of\r\nwork of this kind. Speaking of plants, Dr. D. H. Scott says: “Our ideas\r\nof the course of descent must of necessity be diagrammatic; the process,\r\nas it actually went on, during ages of inconceivable duration, was\r\ndoubtless infinitely too complex for the mind to grasp, even were the\r\nwhole evidence lying open before us. We see an illustration, on a small\r\nscale, of the complexity of the problem, in the case of domesticated\r\nforms, evolved under the influence of man. Though we know that our\r\ncultivated plants, for instance, have been developed from wild species\r\nwithin the human period, and often within quite recent years, yet nothing\r\nis more difficult than to trace, in any given instance, the true history\r\nof a field-crop or garden plant, or even, in many cases, to fix its\r\norigin with certainty.”[5] With some mammalian groups the task, though\r\ndifficult enough, is not so hopeless, because of more complete records,\r\nyet in dealing with mammals a very troublesome complication is introduced\r\nby the existence within the families, and even within the genera, of\r\ntwo or more parallel phyla, or genetic series. Without complete and\r\nperfect material it is impossible to make sure that we are not confusing\r\nthe different phyla with one another and placing in one series species\r\nand genera that properly belong in a different one. Thus, Osborn\r\ndistinguishes no less than seven such phyla among the true rhinoceroses\r\nof the Old and New Worlds, which long followed parallel, but quite\r\nindependent, courses of development, and five phyla among the American\r\nhorses. While these phyla add so much to the difficulty of working out\r\nthe genealogical series, it is possible to simplify the problem and treat\r\nit in a broad and comprehensive manner that will sufficiently establish\r\nthe essential steps of change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.—Left manus of Tapir (_Tapirus terrestris_).\r\n_S._, scaphoid. _L._, lunar. _Py._, pyramidal. _Pis._, pisiform. _Td._,\r\ntrapezoid. _M._, magnum. _Un._, unciform.

Why, then,\r\nshould they be included in the same order? A study of the skeleton,\r\nhowever, reveals the community of structure which obtains between the\r\nthree families, a community which removes them widely from all other\r\nhoofed mammals. In all existing perissodactyls, though not in most of\r\nthe Eocene genera, all the premolars, except the first, have the size\r\nand pattern of the molars. The foramina of the skull, or perforations by\r\nwhich blood-vessels and nerves enter and leave the cranium, are arranged\r\nin a way characteristic of the order and different from that seen in\r\nother hoofed mammals. The femur always has the third trochanter. The\r\nnumber of digits in each foot is usually odd, 1, 3 or 5, but four-toed\r\nforms occur, as the tapirs, which have four toes in the front foot, three\r\nin the hind; the important character is that the median plane of the foot\r\nbisects the third digit, which is symmetrical. The third and fourth, each\r\nasymmetrical, together form a symmetrical pair. Especially characteristic\r\nis the form of the astragalus and calcaneum (ankle and heel bones); the\r\nastragalus has but a single, deeply grooved and pulley-like surface, that\r\nfor the tibia, the lower end is nearly flat and rests almost entirely\r\nupon the navicular, covering but little of the cuboid (see Figs. 146,\r\n148). The calcaneum does not articulate with the fibula and its lower end\r\nis broad and covers most of the cuboid.\r\n\r\nWhile the foregoing list includes the most important of the structural\r\nfeatures which are common to all perissodactyls and differentiate them\r\nfrom other hoofed animals, there are many others which it is needless to\r\nenumerate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.—Left pes of Tapir. _Cal._, calcaneum. _As._,\r\nastragalus. _N._, navicular. _Cn. 1_, _Cn. 2_, _Cn. 3_, first, second\r\nand third cuneiforms. _Mr. II_, _III_, _IV_, second, third and fourth\r\nmetatarsals.]\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table gives the families and principal genera of the\r\nAmerican Perissodactyla; extinct groups are marked †.\r\n\r\n  Suborder CHELODACTYLA.

SUBORDER CHELODACTYLA. NORMAL PERISSODACTYLA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Equidæ. Horses_\r\n\r\nIn order to make intelligible the evolutionary changes which have led up\r\nto the modern horses, it will be necessary to say something concerning\r\nthe dental and skeletal features which characterize these animals. Using\r\nthe term _horses_ in a broad sense to include all the existing members\r\nof the family Equidæ, true horses, asses, zebras and quaggas, we find a\r\ngreater uniformity in the skeleton and teeth than would be expected from\r\nthe external appearance. The differences in appearance are, however,\r\nlargely due to colouring, growth of mane and tail and the size of the\r\nears, which leave no record in the skeleton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.—Asiatic Wild Horse (_Equus przewalskii_).—By\r\npermission of the N.Y. Zoölog. Soc.]\r\n\r\nThe teeth (Figs. 45, p. 95; 154, p. 306) are extremely high-crowned,\r\nor hypsodont, and do not form roots till an advanced age; the incisors\r\nhave a deep, enamel-lined pit, the “mark” in the centre of the grinding\r\nsurface; the first premolar in each jaw is very small and of no\r\nfunctional importance; the other premolars have the same pattern as the\r\nmolars, which is excessively complex in the arrangement of the enamel\r\nridges and the areas of dentine and cement.\r\n\r\nThe skull (Fig. 154, p. 306) is long, especially the facial portion, the\r\neye-socket (orbit) being shifted behind the teeth, which otherwise, on\r\naccount of their great height, would press upon the eye itself; the orbit\r\nis completely encircled in bone. The lower jaw is deep vertically and\r\nthe ascending ramus (see p. 66) very high, on account of the hypsodont\r\ncharacter of the teeth, which thus necessitates a remodelling of the\r\nskull in several respects. The neck is long, each of its seven vertebræ\r\nbeing elongate; except in the atlas and axis, the anterior face of\r\neach centrum is strongly convex and the posterior of all except the\r\natlas is deeply concave; the odontoid process of the axis (see p. 71)\r\nis spout-shaped, concave on the upper and convex on the lower side,\r\nlodging and protecting the spinal cord. The spines of the anterior\r\ndorsal vertebræ are very high, making a low hump at the withers between\r\nthe shoulder-blades; the trunk-vertebræ are so arranged as to make the\r\nback almost straight and horizontal. The limbs and especially the feet\r\nare very long. The two bones of the fore-arm, the ulna and radius, are\r\ncoössified into a single piece (Fig. 30, p. 81), but the limits of each\r\nare still plainly to be seen, especially in a young animal; and it is\r\nevident that the ulna is greatly reduced in size and has lost its middle\r\nportion, while all the weight is borne by the radius. Similarly, in the\r\nhind leg the enlarged tibia, or shin-bone, alone supports the weight; and\r\nonly the two ends of the fibula are preserved (Fig. 38, p. 87), and these\r\nare indistinguishably fused with the tibia in the adult animal, but may\r\nbe made out in the colt. The thigh-bone has a very characteristic shape,\r\nwhich is difficult to describe without an undue use of technical terms,\r\nbut the unusual prominence of the great trochanter (Fig. 35, p. 85) and\r\nof the rotular groove is an important factor in producing this appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.—Left pes of Horse. _Cal._, calcaneum. _As._,\r\nastragalus. _N._, navicular. _Cn. 3_, third cuneiform. _Mt.

II_, _Mc. IV_, rudimentary second and fourth metacarpals,\r\nor splints.]\r\n\r\nThe very long and slender feet are so raised from the ground that the\r\nanimal walks upon the very tips of the toes, the wrist being what\r\nhorsemen call the “knee” and the heel is the “hock,” and the gait is\r\nthoroughly unguligrade. Each foot has but a single functional toe, the\r\nthird or middle one of the primitive five-toed foot; and, as this toe\r\nhas to carry the whole weight supported by its leg, it is necessarily\r\nmuch larger than in animals which distribute the weight among several\r\ndigits. The horses are therefore said to be _monodactyl_, or single-toed,\r\nbut the term is not strictly accurate, for on each side of the functional\r\ndigit is a rudimentary or vestigial one, the 2d and 4th of the original\r\nfive. These rudimentary digits, which are not visible externally, have\r\nno phalanges and are merely “splint-bones,” metapodials (see p. 90)\r\nwhich have very slender shafts and end below in blunt points. The single\r\nfunctional metapodial has encircling its lower articular end a prominent\r\nridge or keel, which fits into a corresponding groove on the upper end\r\nof the first phalanx and serves to prevent lateral dislocation. In most\r\nmammals this keel is merely a projection from the lower articular surface\r\nand is confined to the posterior side, so as not to be visible from the\r\nfront. The terminal or ungual phalanx is much enlarged to carry the great\r\nweight which it supports and is enclosed in the characteristic hoof,\r\nunlike that of any other mammal.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the whole structure of the horses is pre-eminently adapted to\r\nswift running; they are admirable “cursorial machines,” as they have been\r\ncalled, and every part of the skeleton has been modified and specialized\r\nto that end; the narrow, rigid hoofs fit them for walking on firm ground\r\nand they speedily are made helpless in quicksand or bog. Did we know\r\nnothing of their mode of life, we might confidently infer from their\r\nteeth that the horses were grazers, feeding principally upon grass. A\r\nlong-legged, grazing animal must needs have a neck of sufficient length\r\nto enable the mouth to reach the ground easily, unless a long proboscis\r\nis developed; and so we shall find in the history of the horses that the\r\nelongation of the head and neck kept pace with the lengthening of the\r\nlegs and feet.\r\n\r\nThough it can hardly be doubted that the horses passed through most\r\nof their development in North America, yet the immediate ancestry of\r\nall the existing species must be sought in the Old World, none of\r\nthe many Pleistocene species of the western hemisphere having left\r\nany descendants. In North America all of the known Pleistocene forms\r\nbelonged to the genus _Equus_, but the True Horse, _E. caballus_, was\r\nnot among them. The more abundant and important of these species have\r\nbeen sufficiently described in Chapter VII (p. 199); it need only be\r\nrecalled that there were ten or more distinct forms, ranging in size from\r\nthe great _E. †giganteus_ of Texas to the minute _E. †tau_ of Mexico,\r\nwhile the plains and forests were the feeding grounds of moderate-sized\r\nspecies, about 14 hands high.\r\n\r\nIn the latest Pliocene, and no doubt earlier, species of the modern genus\r\n_Equus_ had already come into existence; and in association with these,\r\nat least in Florida, were the last survivors of the three-toed horses\r\nwhich were so characteristic of the early Pliocene and the Miocene.\r\nHowever, little is known about those earliest recorded American species\r\nof _Equus_, for the material so far obtained is very fragmentary. In the\r\nabsence of any richly fossiliferous beds of the upper Pliocene generally,\r\nthere is a painfully felt hiatus in the genealogy of the horses; and it\r\nis impossible to say, from present knowledge, whether all of the many\r\nspecies of horses which inhabited North America in the Pleistocene were\r\nautochthonous, derived from a purely American ancestry, or how large a\r\nproportion of them were migrants from the Old World, coming in when so\r\nmany of the Pleistocene immigrants of other groups arrived. It is even\r\npossible, though not in the least likely, that all of the native American\r\nstocks became extinct in the upper Pliocene and that the Pleistocene\r\nspecies were all immigrants from the eastern hemisphere, or the slightly\r\nmodified descendants of such immigrants; but, on the other hand, it is\r\naltogether probable that some of these numerous species were intruders.\r\nUnfortunately we are in no position yet to distinguish the native from\r\nthe foreign stocks.\r\n\r\nIn the middle Pliocene, which also has preserved but a meagre and scanty\r\nrecord of its mammalian life, we again meet with horses in relative\r\nabundance, but of a far more primitive type. They are still incompletely\r\nknown, but it is clear that they belonged to three parallel series,\r\nor phyla, of three-toed grazing horses, with teeth which, though\r\nhigh-crowned, had not attained to the extreme degree of hypsodontism seen\r\nin the species of _Equus_ and had a somewhat less complex pattern of the\r\ngrinding surface, though distinctly foreshadowing the modern degree of\r\ncomplication. One of the genera (_†Pliohippus_) was not improbably the\r\nancestor of a very peculiar horse (_†Hippidion_) of the South American\r\nPleistocene. These middle Pliocene genera were much smaller animals than\r\nthe Pleistocene horses, aside from the pygmy species of the latter, of\r\nlight and more deer-like proportions, and with three functional toes or\r\ndigits. The median digit (3d of the original five) was much the largest\r\nand carried most of the weight, on hard ground practically all of it;\r\nthe lateral digits (2d and 4th) which in existing horses are represented\r\nby the rudimentary metapodials, or “splints,” though much more slender\r\nthan the median digit, yet had the complete number of parts and each\r\ncarried a small hoof. Mere “dew-claws” as these lateral toes were,\r\nthey may have been of service in helping to support the weight in mud\r\nor snow. In all parts of the skeleton there are little details which\r\nshow that these species of the middle Pliocene were not so advanced\r\nand differentiated as are their modern successors, but it would be\r\nunprofitable to enumerate these details, which are of interest only to\r\nthe anatomist.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Pliocene the horses were very much more numerous and varied\r\nthan in the middle portion of the epoch. The same three genera of grazing\r\nanimals, represented by less advanced and modernized species, are found;\r\nand, in addition, there was an interesting survival (_†Merychippus_) from\r\nthe middle Miocene of an intermediate type, together with several species\r\nof browsing horses (_†Parahippus_ and _†Hypohippus_). In these browsing\r\nforms the teeth were all low-crowned and early formed their roots, and\r\nthe crowns were either without cement or with merely a thin film of it\r\nin the depressions of the grinding surface. The pattern of the grinding\r\nsurface is so very much simpler than in the high-crowned, prismatic teeth\r\nof the grazers that it requires close analysis to detect the fundamental\r\nidentity of plan. Such teeth imply that their possessors must have fed\r\nhabitually upon a softer and less abrasive diet than grass, probably the\r\nleaves and soft shoots of trees and bushes and other succulent vegetable\r\nsubstances, very much in the fashion of existing deer, and must therefore\r\nhave been chiefly inhabitants of the woods and groves and thickets along\r\nstreams, as the grazing species were of the plains and open spaces.\r\n“This assemblage of the progressive and conservative types of horses was\r\ncertainly one of the most distinctive features of Lower Pliocene time in\r\nNorth America” (Osborn).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.—Three-toed, grazing horse (_†Neohipparion\r\nwhitneyi_) of the upper Miocene. Restored from skeletons in the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nIn the upper Miocene very much the same conditions prevailed and, for\r\nthe most part, the same genera of horses, with different and somewhat\r\nless advanced species, were found as in the lower Pliocene, so that no\r\nparticular account of them is needed. In the middle Miocene, however,\r\nthere was a change, the typically grazing horses being very rare or\r\nabsent and those with intermediate forms of teeth taking their place.\r\nEvidently, it was about this time that the horses with more plastic\r\norganization and capable of readjustment to radically different\r\nconditions began to take to the grazing habit, while other phyla, less\r\ncapable of advance, retained the ancient, low-crowned type of grinding\r\nteeth and, after persisting, as we have seen, into the lower Pliocene,\r\nbecame extinct before the middle of that epoch. It is of great interest\r\nto observe that in the genus (_†Merychippus_) intermediate between the\r\nbrowsing and grazing types, the milk-teeth retained the older and more\r\nprimitive character of low crowns without covering of cement, while the\r\npermanent grinders had much higher, cement-covered and complex crowns.\r\nIn the lower Miocene, the variety of horses was much diminished and all\r\nhad the low-crowned, cement-free, browsing type of teeth. Reversing the\r\nstatement, we see that in the middle and still more in the upper Miocene\r\nthe primitive and more or less distinctly homogeneous phylum branched out\r\ninto several series, like a tree, some of the branches continuing and\r\nfurther subdividing through the Pliocene and Pleistocene, while others,\r\nless progressive and less adaptable, underwent but little change and had\r\ndied out before the middle Pliocene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.—Skeleton of _†Neohipparion whitneyi_, American\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nThe Oligocene horses deserve more particular attention, for they were\r\nalmost the half-way stage of development in the long backward ascent to\r\nthe earliest known members of the family in the lower Eocene. We may pass\r\nover the John Day horses (_†Miohippus_), which were somewhat larger than\r\nthose of the White River, but otherwise very like them, merely noting the\r\npresence of a slightly different genus (_†Anchitherium_) which was the\r\nprobable ancestor of _†Hypohippus_ and the other non-progressive types of\r\nthe Miocene and Pliocene. The genus (_†Mesohippus_) which characterizes\r\nthe White River, or lower Oligocene, was a group of species of different\r\nsizes, becoming smaller as we go back in time, the commonest one being\r\nconsiderably smaller than a sheep and differing more or less in all its\r\nparts from the horses of the upper Miocene and all subsequent formations.\r\nThe teeth were very low-crowned and fitted only for the mastication of\r\nsoft vegetable tissue; but it is of particular interest to observe the\r\nbeginnings of the “mark” in the upper incisors in the form of a low\r\nenamel-ridge arising behind the cutting edge of the tooth; the lower\r\nincisors still had the simple chisel-like crowns of the more ancient\r\ngenera; all the premolars, except the first, had already acquired the\r\nmolar-pattern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.—The small, browsing, three-toed, short-necked\r\nhorse (_†Mesohippus bairdi_) of the middle White River. Restored from a\r\nskeleton in the American Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe skull resembled that of a very small modern horse, but with many\r\ndifferences of detail, the most obvious of which is the shallowness of\r\nthe jaws, for depth was not needed to carry the very low-crowned teeth,\r\nand, for the same reason, the ascending ramus of the lower jaw was short.\r\nThe face was relatively short and the eye-socket, which was incompletely\r\nsurrounded by bone, was directly above the hindmost teeth; the cranium\r\nwas proportionately large and capacious and the brain, as is shown by the\r\ncast, was richly convoluted. The neck was relatively far shorter than in\r\nthe Miocene genera, the ball-and-socket joints between its successive\r\nvertebræ were less elaborated and the odontoid process of the axis was in\r\nthe first stage of assuming the spout-like form, being semicylindrical,\r\nwith convex lower and flat upper surface. The trunk was proportionately\r\nlong and the back sloped forward, owing to the greater length of the\r\nhind legs. The limbs and feet were elongate and very slender, but the\r\nfore-arm bones are only partially coössified, and the ulna, though\r\ngreatly attenuated, was still complete. The same is true of the bones\r\nof the lower leg; the shaft of the fibula was hardly more than a thread\r\nof bone, but its full length was preserved. In the fore foot there were\r\nthree functional digits, the median one enlarged and supporting most\r\nof the weight, but its hoof was much thinner and flatter than in the\r\ncorresponding digit in the Miocene and subsequent genera; the lateral\r\ndigits touched the ground and were not entirely functionless and, in\r\naddition, there was a small splint, the rudiment of the fifth digit. The\r\nhind foot was three-toed, without splint.\r\n\r\nThe little Uinta horse (_†Epihippus_) is still very incompletely known,\r\nbut gives us one point at least of greater primitiveness than the\r\nWhite River genus in that only the last two premolars had taken on the\r\nmolar-pattern, the forward two being smaller and simpler. The known\r\nspecies of the Uinta genus was very much smaller than any of the White\r\nRiver forms and even smaller than some of those of the preceding Bridger\r\nformation; but it should be remembered that the Uinta has been but\r\npartially explored and much remains to be learned regarding its fauna.\r\n\r\nThe Bridger horses are fortunately much better known. There are\r\nseveral species of the genus _†Orohippus_, which form a connected and\r\nprogressive series; and, though much smaller than the smallest and oldest\r\nof the White River forms, they were somewhat larger than the known\r\nrepresentative of the Uinta, _†Epihippus_, but distinctly more primitive\r\nin all other respects. The incisors were simple cutting teeth, with no\r\ntrace of even an incipient “mark,” and only one premolar in each jaw,\r\nthe hindmost one, had taken on the molar-pattern. The orbit was farther\r\nforward in the skull and less enclosed behind than in _†Mesohippus_, the\r\ncranium narrower and less capacious; the neck was even shorter and the\r\nodontoid process of the axis still retained the primitive peg-like form.\r\nThe limbs and feet were conspicuously shorter in proportion than those of\r\nthe White River genus; the ulna and fibula were stouter and less reduced\r\nand entirely separate from the radius and tibia respectively. The front\r\nfoot had four functional toes; the fifth digit, which in _†Mesohippus_\r\nhad been reduced to a splint, was completely developed in the Bridger\r\nhorses, but the hind foot was three-toed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.—The “Dawn Horse” (_†Eohippus_) of the lower\r\nEocene. Restored from a skeleton in the American Museum.]\r\n\r\nPassing over, for lack of space, the transitional forms of the Wind\r\nRiver, we come finally to the most ancient known horses, the Wasatch\r\nspecies comprised in the genus _†Eohippus_, the “Dawn Horse,” as its name\r\nsignifies; these were little creatures ranging in size from a cat to a\r\nsmall fox. Despite an unmistakably equine look in the skeletons of these\r\ndiminutive animals, it is only the long intermediate series of species\r\nand genera, together forming a closely linked chain, which we have traced\r\nback from the Pleistocene to the lower Eocene, that leads us to regard\r\n_†Eohippus_ as the ancestral type of the horses. Were only the two ends\r\nof the chain known, he would be a daring speculator who should venture\r\nto connect them. In these little Wasatch horses we have the evidence of\r\na still more ancient form with five fully developed toes in each foot,\r\nsince the front foot had four functional digits and indication of a\r\nsplint, and splints, as the whole history of the long series teaches,\r\nalways are found to be functional digits in the ancestor; the hind foot\r\nhad three toes and perhaps two splints. This preceding form is hardly to\r\nbe looked for in America or Europe; it will be found, if ever, in the\r\nregion whence the great migration came. In all other respects, as well,\r\n_†Eohippus_ was what we should expect the forerunner of the Wind River\r\nand Bridger horses to be. The premolars were all smaller and simpler than\r\nthe molars and the latter in the upper jaw are particularly interesting,\r\nfor they had no crests and ridges of enamel, but four principal conical\r\ncusps, arranged in two transverse pairs, and between the cusps of each\r\npair was a tiny cuspule no bigger than the head of a pin. These cuspules\r\nwere the first step in the formation of the transverse crests, which\r\nwere destined to assume such importance in the subsequent members of the\r\nseries. The neck was very short, the body long, with curved or arched\r\nback, the limbs and feet short, and the hind limb much longer than\r\nthe fore, making the relative proportions of the various parts of the\r\nskeleton very different from what they afterwards became.\r\n\r\nReviewing this marvellous history of steady and long-continued change,\r\nbeginning with the most ancient genus, _†Eohippus_, the following\r\nmodifications may be noted:\r\n\r\n(1) There was a nearly constant, if somewhat fluctuating, increase in\r\nsize, leading by slow gradations from the diminutive horses of the lower\r\nEocene to the great animals of the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n(2) The molar teeth, originally made up of conical cusps, changed to\r\na highly complex pattern of crests and ridges, and the premolars, one\r\nby one, assumed the size and pattern of the molars; the low-crowned,\r\nrooted and cement-free teeth, fitted only for browsing, became very\r\nhigh-crowned, prismatic and cement-covered, admirably adapted to grazing.\r\nBeginning in the upper incisors of the White River _†Mesohippus_, the\r\n“mark” became established as an enamel-lined pit, growing in depth as the\r\nteeth increased their length.\r\n\r\n(3) The face grew relatively longer, the eye-socket being shifted behind\r\nthe teeth and becoming completely encircled in bone, and the jaws were\r\ngreatly increased in depth to accommodate the very long teeth.\r\n\r\n(4) The short neck was greatly elongated and the individual vertebræ\r\nmodified so as to give flexibility with no loss of strength. The\r\nprimitive peg-like odontoid process of the axis became first\r\nsemicylindrical and then spout-shaped.\r\n\r\n(5) The arched back was straightened and the neural spines, especially of\r\nthe anterior dorsals, elongated.\r\n\r\n(6) The limbs grew relatively much longer; the bones of the fore-arm and\r\nlower leg were fused together, the one on the inner side (radius and\r\ntibia) enlarging to carry the entire weight and the external one (ulna\r\nand fibula) becoming more or less atrophied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.—Series of horse skulls in ascending geological\r\norder. _A._, _†Eohippus_, lower Eocene (after Cope). _B._, _†Mesohippus_,\r\nlower and middle Oligocene. _C._, _†Protohippus_, upper Miocene (after\r\nCope). _D._, _Equus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.—Right manus and left pes of _Equus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.—Right manus and left pes of _†Protohippus_.]\r\n\r\n(7) The feet were much elongated and the median (3d) digit of each\r\ngradually enlarged until it carried the whole weight, at the same time\r\nmodifying the shape of the hoof so as to fit it to be the sole support\r\nof the body. The other toes gradually dwindled and became functionless,\r\nthough often retained as splints. The first digit (pollex and hallux)\r\nwas first lost, then the fifth, then the second and fourth were reduced\r\nto dew-claws and finally to splints. Thus the pentadactyl horses of the\r\nlower Eocene were transformed into the monodactyl species of the Pliocene\r\nand Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nIn South America the story of the horses was a brief one, for they were\r\namong the immigrants from the north and did not reach the southern\r\ncontinent till the Pliocene, probably late in that epoch, for none\r\nof the three-toed genera have been found in South America. So far as\r\nknown, these southern equines were small and medium sized animals, with\r\nlarge heads, relatively short feet and somewhat ass-like proportions.\r\nThere were two well-defined groups of these animals: (1) species of\r\nthe genus _Equus_, which thus, at one time or another, inhabited every\r\none of the continents, Australia excepted; (2) three genera peculiar\r\nto South America and developed there from northern ancestors, probably\r\n_†Pliohippus_. Two of these genera (_†Hippidion_ and _†Onohippidium_)\r\ndisplayed curious modifications of the nasal bones, which were\r\nextremely slender and attached to the skull only at their hinder\r\nends, instead of being, as is normally the case, supported for nearly\r\ntheir whole length by lateral articulation with other bones. What can\r\nhave been the significance and function of these excessively slender,\r\nsplint-like nasals, it is difficult to conjecture. The third genus\r\n(_†Hyperhippidium_) was a small mountain-horse, with extremely short\r\nfeet, which were well adapted to climbing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.—Right manus and left pes of _†Mesohippus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.—Right manus and pes of _†Eohippus_.]\r\n\r\nThis is the merest outline sketch of a most wonderful series of gradual\r\nand progressive modifications, a sketch that might readily be expanded\r\ninto a volume, were all the details filled in. While each set of organs,\r\nteeth, skull, neck, body, limbs and feet, might appear to advance\r\nindependently of the others, in reality there was no such independence,\r\nfor at every stage of the progression all the parts must have been so\r\ncoördinated into a harmonious whole, that the animal could thrive and\r\nhold its own in the stress of competition. Could we but discover all the\r\nfacts of environment, on the one hand, and organization, on the other,\r\nwe should doubtless learn that the little _†Eohippus_ was as exquisitely\r\nfitted to its place in the Wasatch world, as are the horses, asses and\r\nzebras of the present day to theirs. It was the response to changing\r\nneeds, whether of food, climate, disease or competition, that was the\r\nmain factor of development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.—Skeleton of a Pampean horse (_†Hippidion\r\nneogæum_).

Restored from a skeleton in the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nIn the lowest of the three substages of the White River Oligocene the\r\nmost conspicuous and abundant fossils are the †titanotheres, the latest\r\nmembers of which were huge animals of almost elephantine proportions.\r\nThey belonged to four parallel, or rather slightly divergent, phyla,\r\ndiffering in the development of the horns, in the shape of the head and\r\nin the relative length and massiveness of the limbs. The teeth were all\r\nlow-crowned, or brachyodont, the canines much too small to have been of\r\nany service as weapons and the incisors had curious little, button-shaped\r\ncrowns, which can have had little or no functional importance, since\r\nthey show hardly any wear, even in old animals. With such front teeth,\r\na prehensile lip and long tongue would seem to have been necessary for\r\ngathering and taking in food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.—Second upper molar, left side, of\r\n_†Titanotherium_. _A._, masticating surface; _B._, outer side of crown.]\r\n\r\nThe †titanotheres were one of two perissodactyl families in which the\r\npremolars never became so large and complex as the molars. The upper\r\nmolars had a longitudinal outer wall, composed of two deeply concave\r\ncusps, and two internal conical cusps, but no transverse ridges; the\r\nlower molars were composed of two crescents, one behind the other, a\r\npattern which was very widely distributed among the early and primitive\r\nartiodactyls and perissodactyls.\r\n\r\nThe so-called “horns” were not strictly such, but a pair of bony\r\nprotuberances from the front of the skull and, from their shape, could\r\nhardly have been sheathed in horn. The long, immensely broad and massive\r\nhead resembled that of some fantastic rhinoceros, as did also the body\r\nand limbs. The brain was quite absurdly small, the cavity for it, lost in\r\nthe huge skull, would hardly contain the fist of an ordinary man; these\r\ngreat beasts must have been incredibly dull and stupid, surpassing even\r\nthe modern rhinoceroses in this respect. As is generally true in mammals\r\nwhich have horns, antlers, or similar weapons borne upon the skull, or\r\nvery large tusks, the bones of the brain-case were made enormously thick\r\nand yet lightened by an intricate system of communicating cavities or\r\n“sinuses,” separated by many bony braces and supports connecting the\r\ninner and outer denser layers, which form the surfaces of the bones.\r\nIn this way the skull is made strong enough without any proportionate\r\nincrease of weight to endure the severe shock of impact, when the horns\r\nor tusks are made use of. The principle is the same as the engineer\r\nemploys in designing a steel truss-bridge. The upper profile of the head\r\nwas deeply concave, just as it is in those rhinoceroses which are armed\r\nwith nasal horns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.—Skull of _†Titanotherium elatum_. American\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nThe neck was of moderate length and the body, as indicated by the long,\r\narched ribs and the greatly expanded hip-bones, was extremely bulky and\r\nmassive. The spines of the anterior dorsal vertebræ were excessively\r\nlong, forming a great hump at the withers. The limbs and feet were\r\ncolumnar, like those of an elephant; the feet were supported on a great\r\npad, while the hoofs were mere excrescences on the periphery of the\r\nfoot. The bones of the fore-arm were entirely separate and the ulna was\r\nvery stout; in the lower leg also the bones were not coössified, but\r\nthe fibula was but moderately heavy. This is a sharp contrast to the\r\narrangement found in the horses and in those hoofed animals generally\r\nwhich are swift runners and have slender, elongate limbs and feet,\r\nsuch as deer, antelopes, camels, etc. Heavy, slow-moving animals, like\r\nelephants, tapirs, rhinoceroses, etc., almost always have separate\r\nfore-arm and leg-bones and generally a heavy ulna. The number of digits\r\nwas four in the front foot and three in the hind. The genera differed\r\nin the proportions of limbs and feet, one having them longer and less\r\nponderous than another, and, no doubt, the former was of swifter gait.\r\n\r\nAt a certain level in the White River beds the †titanotheres abruptly\r\ncease, disappearing with what seems like startling suddenness. In all\r\nprobability, however, the extinction was more gradual and its apparent\r\nabruptness was due, partly at least, to the break in the deposition\r\nof the beds, which is very obvious. Such a break, or “unconformity,”\r\nas geologists call it, almost always implies an unrecorded lapse of\r\ntime, which may have been very long. However it came about, gradually\r\nor suddenly, the extinction of these great animals is difficult to\r\nexplain; no Carnivora of the time could have been formidable enemies\r\nand they had no rivals in their own walk of life. Their stupidity may\r\nhave been a factor, but it seems more likely that the onset of some\r\nnew infectious disease, perhaps imported by incoming migrants from the\r\neastern hemisphere, gave the _coup de grace_. In the lower substage,\r\nbeneath the unconformity, where the remains of †titanotheres are so\r\nabundant, successive changes may be observed. The species with great\r\n“horns,” rounded, flattened or triangular, are confined to the upper\r\nlevels; in the middle section other species, somewhat smaller and with\r\nshorter “horns,” are found, while in the bottom levels the animals are\r\nmuch smaller and have still smaller “horns.”\r\n\r\nThe Uinta †titanotheres were much more numerous and varied than those of\r\nthe White River; in the upper part of these beds are found two genera\r\n(_†Diplacodon_ and _†Protitanotherium_) which already had quite prominent\r\nbony protuberances on the nose; their canines were large enough to be of\r\nvalue as weapons and the incisors were well developed and functional.\r\nEvidently, there was a change here in the manner of feeding, the front\r\nteeth were used for cropping and browsing, a function which in the White\r\nRiver members of the family must have been largely taken over by the\r\nlips and tongue, while the growth of the horn-like protuberances on the\r\nskull rendered the canines superfluous as weapons. This latter change is\r\none which recurs frequently in different phyla of the hoofed animals,\r\nin which the earlier and more primitive members had canine tusks, and\r\nthe later, more advanced representatives developed horns, the tusks\r\ndiminishing as the horns increased. While this rule is a general one, it\r\nis not entirely without exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Uinta and in the Bridger the †titanotheres were extremely\r\nabundant and numerically they are the commonest of all fossils in those\r\nbeds; no less than five series or phyla may be distinguished, three of\r\nthem being added in the upper Bridger. The differences between the phyla,\r\nhowever, principally concern the forms of the teeth and the shape of the\r\nskull; in some the head was short and broad, in others long and narrow,\r\nand in others again of medium proportions; some had broad and extremely\r\nlow-crowned grinding teeth, which in others were higher and more erect.\r\nBut these are matters of minor detail, useful as they are in pointing\r\nthe way to a proper arrangement of the various species; in essentials,\r\nthe forms all agreed and constituted several series of closely allied\r\ngenera. Comparing these Bridger animals with the great †titanotheres\r\nof the lower White River, the first and most obvious difference that\r\nstrikes the observer is the very much smaller size of the more ancient\r\ntypes. With some variation in this respect, hardly any of the Bridger\r\nspecies exceeded a modern tapir in stature and very much resembled one in\r\nproportions. The canine teeth were tusks as large as those of a bear and\r\nmust have been very effective weapons; the molar-pattern was identical\r\nwith that found in the great Oligocene beasts, but the premolars were\r\nsimpler and relatively smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.—†Titanothere (_†Mesatirhinus superior_) with\r\nlong, narrow head; Bridger stage. Restored from a skeleton in the\r\nAmerican Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.—Second upper molar, right side of a Bridger\r\n†titanothere (_†Palæosyops_).]\r\n\r\nThe skull had a straight upper profile, though in several of the phyla\r\nsmall bony protuberances were developed over the eyes, and must clearly\r\nbe regarded as incipient stages of the “horns” which were subsequently\r\nto become so long and prominent. Instead of being broad on top as it\r\nwas in the White River genera, the cranium carried a high ridge of\r\nbone, the sagittal crest, which served for the attachment on each side\r\nof the great temporal muscle, one of the most important of the muscles\r\nof mastication. The trunk was less massive and the limbs were lighter\r\nthan in the Oligocene genera, but the number of digits was the same,\r\nfour in the front foot and three in the hind, and the hoofs were much\r\nbetter developed, serving actually to carry the weight and not being\r\nmere excrescences upon the periphery of a pad. Aside from the proboscis,\r\nwhich lends such a characteristic appearance to the existing tapirs, the\r\n†titanotheres of the Bridger must have looked much like tapirs, and in\r\nearly days, when the mutual relationships had not been satisfactorily\r\ndetermined, they were frequently described as “tapiroid.” The term is\r\nunobjectionable in so far as it is understood that a merely superficial\r\nlikeness is implied, not any real relationship other than that which\r\nunites all the perissodactyl families.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the phyla of the †titanotheres were much more numerous\r\nin the later than in the earlier part of the Bridger stage, when they\r\nwere reduced to two. In the still older Wind River stage these two united\r\ninto one. The Wind River animals (_†Eotitanops_) were similar, but much\r\nsmaller, and occurred in incomparably less variety and abundance. Indeed,\r\none of the most striking differences between the Wind River and the\r\nBridger faunas consists in the great increase and diversification of the\r\n†titanotheres in the latter. There was, it is true, a second phylum of\r\nthe family in the Wind River, represented by the genus _†Lambdotherium_,\r\nbut this was a short-lived series, which left no descendants in the\r\nBridger or subsequent formations. These were the smallest known members\r\nof the family and were light, slender-limbed animals, a very notable\r\ndifference from the others.\r\n\r\nWith the Wind River the history of the †titanotheres breaks off short,\r\nand from present information, can be carried no farther back. Possibly,\r\nthere was a Wasatch ancestor, which only awaits discovery, but it seems\r\nmore likely that these earliest known genera were belated immigrants\r\nfrom the same as yet unknown region, whence came the modernized and\r\nprogressive elements of the Wasatch fauna. Except for its obscure\r\nbeginning, the family was pre-eminently characteristic of North America,\r\nand only two representatives of it have been found outside of that\r\ncontinent, one in Hungary and one in Bulgaria. No doubt others will yet\r\nbe found in Asia.\r\n\r\nBoth in its resemblances and its differences, as compared with the\r\nfar longer and more complex story of the horses, the history of the\r\n†titanotheres has instructive bearings upon evolutionary theory.\r\n\r\n(1) Starting with two phyla, one of which speedily died out, the other\r\nramified into four or five, which continued until the disastrous end,\r\npursuing a nearly parallel course of development.\r\n\r\n(2) There was a great increase in size and especially in bulk and\r\nmassiveness from species no bigger than a sheep in the Wind River stage\r\nto those which rivalled small elephants in the lower White River.\r\n\r\n(3) The teeth underwent comparatively little change; the incisors\r\ndwindled and lost functional importance and the canines were reduced,\r\nhorn-like growths taking their place as weapons; the premolars grew\r\nlarger and more complicated, but never attained the full size and\r\ncomplexity of the molars, as they did in other perissodactyl families.\r\n\r\n(4) Horn-like, bony protuberances appeared first as small humps and knobs\r\nover the eyes and steadily enlarged, at the same time shifting their\r\nposition forward, until they finally attained great size and were on the\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n(5) The skull was modified so as to support these weapons and endure the\r\nshock of impact when they were put to use, (_a_) by making the upper\r\nprofile strongly concave from before backward; (_b_) by greatly widening\r\nthe top of the cranium, where in the older and more primitive genera the\r\nhigh and thin sagittal crest was placed; (_c_) by immensely increasing\r\nthe thickness of the cranial bones and at the same time hollowing them by\r\nmeans of an intricate system of cavities; in this way sufficient strength\r\nwas secured without undue increase in weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.—Series of heads of †titanotheres in\r\nascending geological order. _A._, _†Palæosyops_, lower Bridger. _B._,\r\n_†Manteoceras_, upper Bridger. _C._, _†Diplacodon_, Uinta. _D._,\r\n_†Titanotherium_, extreme development of horns, White River. From models\r\nin the American Museum and Princeton University.]\r\n\r\n(6) The growth of the brain did not keep pace with the increase in the\r\nsize and weight of the body and head, and this deficiency may have been a\r\nfactor in determining the early extinction of the family.\r\n\r\n(7) To support the huge head, stout ligaments and powerful muscles were\r\nneeded in the neck and trunk and these in turn required large bony,\r\nsurfaces for their attachment. To meet this need, the spines of the\r\nanterior trunk-vertebræ were very much lengthened, so as to form a hump\r\nat the shoulders, and this elongation of the spines went on in proportion\r\nto the growing weight of the head.\r\n\r\n(8) The limb-bones increased in thickness until they became extremely\r\nmassive, to carry the immense weight of the body, and they eventually\r\nlost the marrow-cavities, which were filled up with spongy bone, a\r\ngreat gain in strength. As is generally, though not universally, true\r\nof the large and heavy mammals, there was no coössification between the\r\nlimb-bones and no great increase in their proportionate length. The\r\nthigh-bone, or femur, lost the cylindrical shape of the shaft, becoming\r\nflattened and very broad, and acquiring something of the appearance of\r\nthe same bone in the elephants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.—Right manus of †titanotheres. _A._,\r\n_†Titanotherium_, White River (after Marsh). _B._, _†Palæosyops_,\r\nBridger, Princeton University Museum.]\r\n\r\n(9) There was no loss or coössification of elements in wrist (carpus)\r\nor ankle (tarsus) and _no reduction of digits_ within the limits of the\r\nfamily. In the latest, largest and most specialized genera, as well as\r\nin the earliest, smallest and most primitive, there were four toes in\r\nthe front foot and three in the hind. We have the most cogent reasons\r\nfor assuming that all mammals were derived from ancestors which had\r\nfive toes in each foot, neither more nor less. If this be true, then\r\nthe most ancient known †titanotheres, which were small and light, had\r\nalready suffered the loss of the first digit in the fore foot and of the\r\nfirst and fifth digits in the hind foot, but there reduction ceased.\r\nWith the growing body-weight, long, narrow and slender feet would have\r\nbeen a detriment, whereas in swift-running animals, like horses and\r\ndeer, long and very slender feet are a great advantage. The contrast is\r\nboth striking and instructive, showing the importance of a short, broad,\r\npolydactyl and pillar-like foot to very large and heavy mammals, all of\r\nwhich have feet of this character.\r\n\r\n(10) The hoofs, as shown by the terminal bones (ungual phalanges) which\r\nformed their bony cores, were reduced in size until they became mere\r\nnail-like excrescences around the border of the massive foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n3, 4. _Tapiridæ and †Lophiodontidæ. Tapirs and †Lophiodonts_\r\n\r\nThe history of the tapir family is not at all satisfactorily known,\r\npartly because tapirs are comparatively rare as fossils in all of the\r\nTertiary formations, and still more for the reason that the specimens so\r\nfar collected are so fragmentary, not a single half-complete skeleton\r\namong them. Had these animals actually been as rare in North America\r\nas the fossils would seem to indicate, they could not possibly have\r\nmaintained themselves for so long a time, throughout nearly the whole of\r\nthe Tertiary and Quaternary periods. For some reason, probably because\r\nthey have always been forest-haunting animals, their habits must have\r\nkept them in places remote from the areas where the accumulation of\r\nsediments was in progress, and thus only occasional stragglers were\r\nburied and preserved.\r\n\r\nThe rarity and incompleteness of the material render it impossible to\r\ngive any such full account of the tapirs as is practicable for the horses\r\nand †titanotheres, but the circumstance is less unfortunate in the case\r\nof the tapirs than in that of many other families. This is because these\r\ncreatures have been so conservative and unprogressive, that they have\r\nundergone comparatively little change since their earliest recorded\r\nappearance. They have been aptly termed “living fossils” and seem like\r\nbelated survivors from some older world, out of place in the modern order\r\nof things. Attention has already been directed (p. 137) to the remarkable\r\ngeographical distribution of the tapirs at the present time; Central and\r\nSouth America, southeastern Asia and the adjoining islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.—American Tapir (_Tapirus terrestris_). By\r\npermission of W. S. Berridge, London.]\r\n\r\nThe tapirs are all of moderate size, going back to very small forms\r\nat the beginning of their history and never at any period developing\r\ninto large animals. The only striking and unusual feature about any of\r\nthe existing members of the family is the long proboscis, a flexible,\r\ndependent snout, and, were they all extinct and nothing known of them but\r\nthe skull, this proboscis could have been confidently predicated of them\r\nfrom the great shortening of the nasal bones. Small tusks, not showing\r\nwhen the mouth is closed, are formed in an exceptional way by the\r\nenlarged external upper incisor and the lower canine, the upper canine\r\nbeing much reduced and without function. The grinding teeth have very\r\nlow crowns, premolars (except the first) and molars are all alike and of\r\na very simple pattern, which has been independently repeated in several\r\ndifferent orders of herbivorous mammals; in both upper and lower teeth,\r\nthere are two elevated, straight, transverse crests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.—Skull of American Tapir, right side.]\r\n\r\nExcept for the modification of the skull which is conditioned by the\r\ndevelopment of the proboscis, the skeleton might belong to any one\r\nof several Eocene or Oligocene families, and it is this generalized,\r\nindifferent character which has led to the dubbing of many early\r\nperissodactyls as “tapiroids.” The limbs are short and moderately heavy,\r\nthe bones of the fore-arm and lower leg all separate and the number of\r\ntoes is four in the front foot and three in the hind. The toes end in\r\nwell-formed separate hoofs, but behind them is a pad, which carries most\r\nof the weight. The body is covered with smooth, short hair, which in the\r\nAmerican species is of a uniform dark brown, but in the Asiatic species\r\nthe head, neck and limbs are black and the body is white. In both,\r\nhowever, the young have longitudinal, light-coloured stripes and spots on\r\na dark ground (_see_ Fig. 6, p. 47) indicating what the colour-pattern of\r\nthe ancestral forms must have been. As might be inferred with certainty\r\nfrom the low-crowned teeth, the tapirs are browsing, not grazing,\r\nanimals, feeding upon leaves and shoots and other soft vegetable tissues.\r\nThey are shy and solitary in habit and live usually in thick forests and\r\nnear water, which they frequently enter, both for bathing and as a place\r\nof refuge when pursued. Under modern conditions, the only perissodactyls\r\nof the western hemisphere are the tapirs of the Neotropical region, North\r\nAmerica proper, which for ages was the principal home of the order, not\r\nhaving a single representative now.\r\n\r\nIn the Pleistocene, tapirs were apparently more abundant than in any\r\nof the Tertiary epochs, but this was probably due to the fact that the\r\nPleistocene of the forested regions is far more fully recorded than is\r\nany Tertiary stage. One species, which was hardly distinguishable from\r\nthe Recent Central American form, was common in the forested region east\r\nof the Mississippi and in California, and a second species (_Tapirus\r\n†haysii_) was larger and heavier than the other. Except in Texas, none\r\nhave been found in the Great Plains area, nor are they likely to be, for\r\nthat region, then as now, appears to have been devoid of forests. No\r\ndoubt, these Pleistocene species had substantially the same habits as the\r\nexisting ones, but they were adapted to a colder climate and a different\r\nvegetation, for, except the Pinchaque Tapir (_T. roulini_) of the high\r\nAndes, all the modern species are tropical in distribution.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Pliocene and Miocene tapirs, but meagre information has\r\nbeen obtained. Enough material has been gathered by the collectors to\r\ndemonstrate the continuous presence of the family in North America\r\nthroughout those epochs, but the broken and fragmentary specimens are\r\ninsufficient to show what the structural changes were. It should be\r\nremembered, however, that it is only in the region of the Great Plains\r\nand the Great Basin of Nevada that any considerable quantity of Miocene\r\nand Pliocene mammals have been found, and in those regions tapirs\r\nprobably never were common. If the Peace Creek formation of Florida is\r\nproperly classified as latest Pliocene, then at that time the American\r\ntapirs were essentially what they are to-day, for the Florida species is\r\nhardly separable from the modern _T. terrestris_.\r\n\r\nNot till we reach the lower Oligocene, or White River beds, do we get\r\nmaterial which permits the making of definite statements regarding the\r\ncourse of developmental changes. The White River genus, _†Protapirus_,\r\nwhich is also found in the middle Oligocene of Europe, was a much smaller\r\nanimal than any of the known Pleistocene or Recent species, barely more\r\nthan half the size, in fact. The teeth show that the small tusks were\r\ncanines, both above and below, and that the curious substitution of\r\nthe external upper incisor for the canine had not yet taken place. The\r\ngrinding teeth were identical in pattern with those of the existing\r\ngenus, but not all the premolars had yet acquired the form and size of\r\nthe molars. In the skull the nasal bones had begun to shorten, but the\r\nchange had not yet made much progress, and the proboscis must have been\r\nin merely an incipient stage of development. What little is known of the\r\nskeleton other than the skull was like that of the modern genus, but the\r\nbones were much smaller and proportionately lighter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.—Skull of White River tapir (_†Protapirus\r\nvalidus_), left side. Princeton University Museum. N.B. This figure is\r\nmuch less reduced than Fig. 168.]\r\n\r\nThe Eocene tapirs are still very imperfectly known; all that can be said\r\nof them is that they become successively smaller as they are traced\r\nbackward in time, and that in them the premolar teeth were all smaller\r\nand simpler than the molars. The Wasatch genus (_†Systemodon_) is the\r\nmost ancient member of the series yet discovered. Dating from the Eocene\r\nimmigration, the tapirs are to be regarded as a North American family,\r\nfor there is here a complete continuity from the lower Eocene to the\r\nPleistocene, while in Europe they first appeared, probably by migration\r\nfrom North America, in the middle Oligocene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.—Head of the White River tapir (_†Protapirus\r\nvalidus_). Restored from a skull in the museum of Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nIn South America the history of the tapirs is even shorter and less\r\neventful than that of the horses; the latter, as we have seen, reached\r\nthe southern continent in the Pliocene and there gave rise to a number of\r\npeculiar and characteristic genera, but the tapirs have been found only\r\nin the Pleistocene of Argentina and Brazil and only the modern genus is\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nWofully broken and incomplete as the developmental history of the tapirs\r\nstill is, the fragments are nevertheless sufficient to show a mode of\r\nevolution differing in certain important respects from that followed by\r\nthe horses or †titanotheres. Certain features are common to all three\r\ngroups, such as the increase in size and in proportionate stoutness\r\nfrom stage to stage and the gradual enlargement and complication of\r\nthe premolar teeth. On the other hand, the tapirs have been very\r\nconservative, and they underwent far less radical changes than did either\r\nof the other families. Aside from the proboscis and the modifications of\r\nthe skull which the development of that organ necessitated, these animals\r\nremain to-day very nearly what they were in Oligocene times. This, then,\r\nis an example of development practically restricted to a few organs,\r\nwhile all the other parts of the structure changed but little.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.—Upper teeth, left side, of tapirs, showing\r\ncomparative sizes. _A_, _†Protapirus validus_, White River Oligocene.\r\n_B_, _Tapirus terrestris_, modern. _i3_, external incisor. _c_, canine.\r\n_m1_, first molar.]\r\n\r\nThe extinct †lophiodonts, like the tapirs, of which they would seem to\r\nhave been near relatives, are known only from incomplete material, and\r\ncomparatively little has been learned regarding their history. While they\r\nwere abundant and varied in Europe, during the Eocene epoch, they never\r\nwere a striking or prominent element among the mammals of North America,\r\nwhere they persisted one stage later, and they did not reach South\r\nAmerica. In North America they are found from the Wasatch to the White\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nThe White River genus (_†Colodon_), which is fairly well known, might\r\nalmost be described as combining the characters of horses and tapirs;\r\nbut such an expression is not to be interpreted as meaning that this\r\ngenus is in any sense a connecting link or transition between the two\r\nfamilies, but merely that in certain important respects its course of\r\ndevelopment ran parallel with that followed by the horses. The teeth\r\nwere very tapir-like, especially those of the lower jaw, which, indeed,\r\nare hardly distinguishable from those of a tapir, and the premolars had\r\nthe molar-pattern. The limbs were very light and slender and the feet\r\nlong and narrow; the fore foot retained a small fifth digit; the feet,\r\nespecially the hinder one, had a resemblance to those of the contemporary\r\nhorses (_†Mesohippus_), though the median digit was not so much enlarged,\r\nnor the lateral ones so far reduced. It is highly probable that, had this\r\nfamily persisted till the Pleistocene, instead of dying out in the lower\r\nOligocene, it would have eventually terminated in monodactyl forms.\r\n\r\nThe †lophiodonts of the Eocene are represented by very fragmentary\r\nmaterial; so far as that material goes, it does not show much change from\r\nthe White River genus, except that the premolar teeth were smaller and\r\nsimpler, the limbs and feet retaining the same characteristics of length\r\nand slenderness. The Wasatch genus (_†Heptodon_) had a similar lightness\r\nof limb and narrowness of feet, these characters thus appearing at the\r\nvery beginning of the family history, so far as their North American\r\ncareer is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Rhinocerotidæ. True Rhinoceroses_\r\n\r\nThe history of the great group of rhinoceroses and rhinoceros-like\r\nanimals is a very long and complicated one, inferior in its completeness\r\nonly to that of the horses. The complexity of the story arises from the\r\nlarge number of phyla into which the families are divisible, and, despite\r\nthe great wealth of material and the admirable preservation of much of\r\nit, it is extremely difficult to find a clew through the mazes of this\r\nlabyrinthine genealogy. From the standpoint of the existing geographical\r\ndistribution of animals, few mammals could seem more foreign and exotic\r\nto North American life than do the rhinoceroses, and yet for a very long\r\ntime that continent was one of the chief areas of their development, so\r\nfar, at least, as that development can be followed. It is even probable,\r\nthough not clearly demonstrable, that the family originated here and\r\nsubsequently spread to the Old World, but not to South America, where no\r\nmember of it has ever been found. The later history of the rhinoceroses\r\nran its course in the Old World entirely, and the highest specializations\r\nwithin the family are to be found there; in North America these animals\r\nare not known to have persisted beyond the lower Pliocene, and if they\r\ndid survive, it was only as a few stragglers in out of the way places.\r\n\r\nThe modern rhinoceroses are restricted to Africa, southern Asia and some\r\nof the larger Malay islands, Borneo, Sumatra and Java, and within these\r\nwide geographical limits are to be found the terminal representatives of\r\nat least three separate and quite distinct phyla, the African, Indian and\r\nSumatran genera respectively (_Opsiceros_, _Rhinoceros_, _Dicerorhinus_).\r\nIt will be advisable to begin the study of this peculiarly interesting\r\nfamily with a brief examination of its modern members, even though none\r\nof these are found in the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.—Skull of the Javan Rhinoceros (_R. sondaicus_).\r\nNote the single upper incisor, and the rough surface on the nasal bones\r\nfor the attachment of the single horn.]\r\n\r\nAll the existing rhinoceroses are large and massive animals, ranging\r\nfrom four feet to six feet six inches in height at the shoulder, and all\r\nhave solid dermal horns, except in most females of the Javan species[6]\r\n(_R. sondaicus_). The Indian and Javan species have a single horn on\r\nthe nose, while those of Africa and Sumatra have, in addition to the\r\nnasal horn, a second one on the forehead. The horns, thus, do not form\r\na transverse pair, but are placed in the median line of the head, one\r\nbehind the other; it should also be noted that these horns are solid,\r\ndermal structures, made up of agglutinated fibres or hairs and not having\r\na bony core formed by outgrowths of the skull, as do the horns of most\r\nruminants, such as oxen, sheep and antelopes, which are therefore called\r\n“hollow-horned” (Cavicornia). The skull, however, betrays the presence of\r\nhorns by the extremely rough areas which serve for their attachment and\r\nthus the presence or absence of these weapons may be readily determined\r\nin the case of an extinct species of which only the skeleton remains.\r\nThe skin is very thick and coarse, typically “pachydermatous,” and is\r\nquite naked in most of the species; but in the Sumatran form there is a\r\nsparse coat of hair, which is quite thick in the young animal. In the\r\nIndian _Rhinoceros unicornis_ the enormously thick skin has conspicuous\r\nand regularly arranged folds, which make the creature look as though\r\nencased in armour; the ears and tail are tufted with hair. In the African\r\nand Sumatran genera the folds are obscurely marked and not definitely\r\narranged, giving the body a smoother appearance. All the existing\r\nspecies, except one, are browsers and feed upon leaves and twigs, and\r\nthey frequent forests and marshes where their food is abundant. Not that\r\nthese and other browsing animals do not occasionally eat grass, but it is\r\nnot their principal diet. The exception noted is the largest of all the\r\nliving species, the Broad-Lipped Rhinoceros (erroneously called “White”)\r\nof Africa, _Opsiceros simus_, which is strictly a grazing animal and\r\ntherefore frequents more open country than the other African species, _O.\r\nbicornis_.\r\n\r\nThere are considerable differences in proportions and general appearance\r\namong the various species, but they all have short necks, very long\r\nand massive bodies, short and heavy limbs and short, columnar feet,\r\nwhich look much like those of elephants, but have only three toes\r\neach. In all but two of the living species the upper lip is prehensile\r\nand characteristically pointed and can be used to pick up very small\r\nobjects, like the “finger” on an elephant’s trunk; in the Sumatran\r\nspecies (_Dicerorhinus sumatrensis_) the lip, though pointed, is\r\nhorny and inflexible, while in the African _O. simus_ it is broad and\r\nstraight-edged.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the modern rhinoceroses are extremely characteristic and\r\nmay always be recognized at a glance. In the African genus (_Opsiceros_)\r\nthere are no front teeth, all the incisors and canines being lost;\r\nthe other genera have on each side a single large and trenchant upper\r\nincisor, in shape like a broad, obliquely edged chisel, which shears\r\nagainst a still larger elongate and tusk-like lower incisor, that is\r\nprocumbent and points directly forward. The Indian Rhinoceros (_R.\r\nunicornis_) is said to use its tusks as weapons in very much the same\r\nfashion as the Wild Boar. Between the large lower tusks there is a pair\r\nof very small incisors, which can have little or no functional value;\r\nthe third lower incisor has been suppressed, as have also the canines\r\nof both jaws. The dental formula then is: _i_ 1/2 or 0/0, _c_ 0/0, _p_\r\n4/4, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 28 or 34 (see p. 93). The premolars, except the\r\nfirst, though somewhat smaller than the molars, have essentially the same\r\npattern. The upper molars have moderately high crowns, yet they are\r\npurely brachyodont, except in the grazing, broad-lipped African species\r\n(_O. simus_), in which they may fairly be called hypsodont. The external\r\nwall of the tooth is broad and nearly smooth, not divided into cusps,\r\nas it is in the horses and tapirs, and the two transverse crests, which\r\nin the tapirs are directly transverse, are very oblique. In all the\r\nexisting species additional complications are given by the short spurs,\r\nwhich project inward from the outer wall or from the transverse crests.\r\nThe lower molars are formed each of two crescents, one behind the other,\r\nbut their arms or horns are angulate, not curved as they are in other\r\nperissodactyls which have crescentic lower teeth.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of the skull is very concave in the antero-posterior\r\ndirection and very broad over the cranium, where there is no sagittal\r\ncrest. The nasal bones are immensely thick and strongly arched, with the\r\nconvexity upward; both this arching of the nasals and the fore-and-aft\r\nconcavity of the skull are devices for giving a strong and solid\r\nattachment to the great nasal horn, for the attachment of which these\r\nbones have an extremely rough surface, and in the two-horned species,\r\na second roughened area on the forehead marks the place of attachment\r\nof the frontal horn. The bones of the cranium are very thick, but\r\nlightened by the many chambers which traverse them. The articulation of\r\nthe lower jaw with the skull is in some respects unique among mammals;\r\nthe postglenoid process is a long spike, which fits inside of a bony\r\nlump (the _postcotyloid process_) behind the condyle of the lower jaw,\r\nand the posterior margin of the latter is greatly thickened. The neck\r\nis short and stout, the trunk very long, broad and deep, the long and\r\nstrongly arched ribs and the widely expanded hip-bones providing space\r\nfor the great mass of viscera. The bones of the limbs are short and very\r\nmassive; the humerus has a very prominent deltoid ridge and the femur an\r\nunusually large third trochanter; the bones of the fore-arm and lower\r\nleg are separate, as in the massive ungulates generally. The foot-bones\r\nare likewise extremely short and heavy, and the number of digits is\r\nthree in each foot. Each of the five or more existing species has its\r\nskeletal peculiarities, every portion of the bony structure showing\r\ncharacteristic features; but these are only minor modifications of the\r\ngeneral plan and may be neglected in any comprehensive account of the\r\nliving representatives of the family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.—Left manus of Indian Rhinoceros (_R.\r\nunicornis_).]\r\n\r\nIn order to find any American members of this family, it is necessary\r\nto go back to the lower Pliocene, where a great abundance of them is\r\nencountered, representing, according to Osborn’s view, four or five\r\nphyla; and just as in the case of the horses of the same formation, they\r\nwere an assemblage curiously made up of progressive and old-fashioned,\r\nconservative genera,—some were persistent native stocks, others the\r\ndescendants of immigrants from the Old World, which reached America\r\nin the middle Miocene. There was great variety of form, size and\r\nproportions among these animals, North America at that time having a\r\nlarger number of genera and species than Africa and Asia combined have\r\nnow. Some were quite small, some large, though none equalled the larger\r\nmodern species. Some of the genera had relatively long legs, but in one\r\ngenus, _†Teleoceras_ (Fig. 125, p. 230), an Old World type, they were\r\nmost grotesquely short, the belly almost touching the ground, as in a\r\nhippopotamus. Most of these rhinoceroses were hornless, but _†Teleoceras_\r\nhad a small horn on the very tip of the nose. In consequence of the\r\nlack of horns, the nasal bones were thin and weak, in marked contrast\r\nto the massive, convex nasals of the modern species, and, for the same\r\nreason, the upper profile of the skull was nearly straight. Except\r\nfor minor details, the dentition was in very nearly the modern stage\r\nof development; there was a single trenchant upper incisor on each\r\nside, a procumbent lower tusk and between the tusks a pair of small\r\nincisors; the other incisors and the canines were already lost. One genus\r\n(_†Peraceras_) had lost all the upper front teeth. The grinding teeth had\r\nthe same character as in the existing species, but were somewhat simpler,\r\nowing to less development of the accessory spurs. In the more progressive\r\ntypes the teeth were rather high-crowned, though in none were they\r\nactually hypsodont; while the persistent ancient genera had teeth with\r\nmuch lower crowns.\r\n\r\nAside from the differences in the skull, which are obviously to be\r\ncorrelated with the absence or very small size of the horn, the skeleton\r\nin these Pliocene genera differed but little from the type common to the\r\nexisting rhinoceroses, and in all the species the feet were three-toed.\r\nIn short, the dentition and skeleton, except the skull, had already\r\nattained to substantially the modern conditions. While the Old World at\r\nthat time had both horned and hornless rhinoceroses in abundance, none\r\nof the genera with large and fully developed horns ever migrated to\r\nthe western hemisphere. This is the more remarkable in that the great\r\n†Woolly Rhinoceros (_Opsiceros †antiquitatis_) of the Pleistocene, which\r\nhad two very large horns, inhabited Siberia with the †Mammoth (_Elephas\r\n†primigenius_). The latter extended its range through Alaska and the\r\nnorthern United States, but the rhinoceros, for some unknown reason, did\r\nnot accompany it in its eastward wanderings.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceroses of the upper Miocene did not differ sufficiently from\r\nthose of the lower Pliocene to call for particular attention. Needless to\r\nsay, there were differences between the species of the two epochs, but\r\nin such a sketch as this only the broader and more obvious changes can\r\nbe taken into account. Even in the middle Miocene the only feature which\r\ncalls for notice was the first appearance in North America of the Old\r\nWorld genus _†Teleoceras_, which became so abundant in the upper Miocene\r\nand lower Pliocene. The middle Miocene species (_†T. medicornutus_) would\r\nseem to have been descended from _†T. aurelianensis_ of the lower Miocene\r\nof France; the two species agreed not only in having a small horn on the\r\ntip of the nose, but also in the presence of a still smaller one on the\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Miocene but two phyla of rhinoceroses have been found,\r\nboth of which were the comparatively little changed descendants of\r\nOligocene ancestors; and there was thus a notable difference from the\r\nrhinoceroses of the middle Miocene and subsequent stages, which were\r\ndecidedly more modern in character. One of these phyla was constituted\r\nby those rhinoceroses (_†Diceratherium_, Fig. 129, p. 239) which had a\r\ntransversely placed pair of horns on the nose, not one behind the other,\r\nas in all of the subsequent two-horned species, of which North America\r\nhad but the one middle Miocene form (_†T. medicornutus_) mentioned\r\nabove. The lower Miocene species of _†Diceratherium_ was a very small\r\nanimal, and smaller than any member of the family from later formations.\r\nThe †diceratheres originated in North America, and the stages of their\r\ndevelopment may be clearly made out; they also migrated to the eastern\r\nhemisphere and have been found in France, though it is possible that\r\nthe genus was not truly monophyletic and arose independently in both\r\nhemispheres.\r\n\r\nThe second phylum is that of the hornless forms (_†Cænopus_) which were\r\nso abundantly represented in the Oligocene and persisted with little\r\nchange into the Pliocene.\r\n\r\nIn the upper Oligocene, or John Day, the †diceratheres are the only\r\nrhinoceroses certainly yet obtained, and of these there were several\r\nspecies, large and small. The hornless forms may have been present in\r\nOregon, but this has not been clearly demonstrated. That they continued\r\nto exist somewhere during that stage is hardly open to question, for they\r\nreappeared in the lower Miocene.\r\n\r\nFrom the White River, or lower Oligocene, many well-preserved\r\nrhinoceroses, including complete skeletons, have been gathered in the\r\nvarious collections and display very interesting differences in the three\r\nsubstages of the White River beds. In the uppermost substage is found the\r\napparent beginning of the †dicerathere phylum, though it may be traced\r\nback to the middle substage; the nasal bones had become much thickened\r\nso as to serve as a support for the horns, and these are indicated by a\r\nsmall, but very rough, area on the outer side of each nasal. Comparing\r\nthis White River species with those of the upper Oligocene and lower\r\nMiocene, two differences may be observed: in the later species the\r\nhorn-supports were well defined bony knobs or prominences, and these\r\nknobs were close to the anterior ends of the nasals; while in the White\r\nRiver animal the places for the attachment of the horns were mere\r\nroughened areas, and these were well behind the tips of the nasals.\r\nThis is not an infrequent sort of change, that horns should shift their\r\nposition forward or that the portion of the nasals in front of the horns\r\nshould be shortened. Parallel changes occurred among the †titanotheres.\r\n\r\nIn the middle White River all the rhinoceroses were hornless, but the\r\nsame two phyla may be distinguished; the actual starting point of the\r\n†diceratheres had no indication of the nasal horns, but may be identified\r\nas such by their close resemblance in other respects to the species of\r\nthe upper substage in which the incipient horns appeared. Much commoner\r\nwere the members of the typical hornless line (see Fig. 135, p. 256),\r\nwhich, though true and unmistakable rhinoceroses, were yet far removed in\r\nmany details of structure from the progressive genera of the middle and\r\nupper Miocene. There are several species in this phylum, which constitute\r\na series of diminishing size almost in proportion to their increasing\r\nantiquity. The dentition was already thoroughly and characteristically\r\nrhinoceros-like, but a more primitive feature was the presence of a\r\nsecond upper incisor, a small tooth placed behind the trenchant one,\r\nmaking the incisor formula 2/2; the third incisor and the canines of\r\nboth jaws were already lost. The assumption of the molar-pattern by\r\nthe premolars varied much in degree of completeness in the different\r\nspecies; the upper molars, while having all the essentials of the\r\nrhinocerotic plan of structure, had a much less complex appearance than\r\nin the Recent genera, because of the absence of the accessory spurs; and\r\nall the grinding teeth were very low-crowned, in strong contrast to the\r\nhigh-crowned (yet not properly hypsodont) teeth of the middle Miocene and\r\nsubsequent genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.—Skull of †hornless rhinoceros (_†Cænopus\r\ntridactylus_); middle White River stage. (After Osborn.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.—Second upper molar, left side, of _†Cænopus_,\r\nshowing the masticating surface.]\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, there was much variation in size among the species,\r\nbut none was as large as those of the Miocene and Pliocene genera, not\r\nto mention the enormous animals of the Pleistocene and Recent epochs in\r\nthe Old World. The commoner species of the middle White River substage\r\n(_†Cænopus occidentalis_) was an animal nearly equalling in size the\r\nAmerican Tapir (_T. terrestris_) and quite like that species in its\r\nproportions, the limbs being relatively longer and less heavy and the\r\nfeet narrower than in the rhinoceroses of the subsequent geological\r\nepochs. The skull, being hornless, had thin, pointed and nearly flat\r\nnasal bones, an almost straight and horizontal upper profile, and a short\r\nand low, but distinct, sagittal crest; the cranial bones were quite\r\nthin, there being no extensive development of sinuses within them. The\r\narticulation of the lower jaw with the skull was only beginning to take\r\non the characteristic peculiarities seen in the later genera, and the\r\nhinder margin of the lower jaw was not much thickened. Thus, many of the\r\nfeatures which distinguish the skull in all Recent and Pleistocene and\r\nmost Pliocene, and upper and middle Miocene rhinoceroses were entirely\r\nlacking in _†Cænopus_, yet no anatomist could doubt that the White River\r\nanimal was a genuine rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThe neck was short, but not very heavy, the trunk elongate, but not\r\nmassive, the ribs not being inordinately long nor strongly arched, and\r\nthe hip-bones so little expanded that they were tapiroid rather than\r\nrhinocerotic in appearance. The limb-bones were relatively much more\r\nslender than in any existing species, and, although every one of them was\r\ncharacteristically that of a rhinoceros, yet the comparative lightness of\r\nbody and slenderness of limb gave to these bones a certain resemblance\r\nto those of tapirs. The feet, which were moderately elongate and rather\r\nnarrow, were three-toed, as in all subsequent North American species and\r\nin all existing members of the family.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient and primitive representative of the true rhinoceroses\r\nso far discovered occurs in the lowest division of the White River beds\r\nand is of particular interest as throwing light upon the origin of\r\nthe family. The genus (_†Trigonias_) differed from that (_†Cænopus_)\r\nwhich was so abundant in the middle White River substage in several\r\nhighly significant particulars, though on a merely casual inspection\r\none might easily be misled into thinking that the two animals were\r\nnearly identical, for _†Trigonias_ was an undoubted rhinoceros.\r\nSuch an identification, however, would be a great mistake, for the\r\ndifferences, though not striking, are very important. In the upper jaw\r\nthe first or anterior incisor had already assumed the characteristic\r\ntrenchant, chisel-like shape, but two other incisors were present also,\r\nthus bringing the number up to the original three, common to all early\r\nperissodactyls; even more interesting is the presence of a small upper\r\ncanine. The lower jaw likewise had three incisors on each side, the\r\nfirst and third small, the second enlarged and tusk-like, but the canine\r\nhad already been suppressed, and thus the dental formula was: _i_ 3/3,\r\n_c_ 1/0, _p_ 4/4, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 42, or 14 more than the formula of the\r\nexisting African species. The premolars were smaller and less complex\r\nthan the molars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176.—Skull of _†Trigonias osborni_, lower White\r\nRiver. (After Hatcher.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.—Anterior end of right upper jaw of _†Trigonias\r\nosborni_ (after Lucas). _c._, canine. _i 3_, external incisor. _i 2_,\r\nmiddle incisor. _i 1_, first incisor.]\r\n\r\nFrom this ancient genus may readily be inferred the steps by which the\r\npeculiar characters of the anterior teeth in the true rhinoceroses were\r\nattained. The first stage was undoubtedly an animal in which, as in all\r\nother Eocene perissodactyls, there were three well-developed incisors on\r\neach side of both jaws, 12 in all, and moderately prominent canine tusks;\r\nall these teeth were erect. The second stage was the enlargement of the\r\nfirst upper and second lower incisors, the latter becoming less erect and\r\nbeginning to assume the recumbent position; at the same time the other\r\nincisors and the canines were reduced in size and were so little used\r\nthat they lost their functional importance. The third stage, in which\r\nthe first and second lower incisors were horizontal and pointed directly\r\nforward, and the first upper and second lower teeth were still further\r\nenlarged, the non-functional teeth reduced in size and the lower canine\r\nsuppressed, was realized in the genus _†Trigonias_. There were thus but\r\ntwo hypothetical stages between this lower White Region genus and the\r\ntapir-like forms of the middle Eocene, so far, at least, as the anterior\r\nteeth are concerned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.—Anterior end of left upper jaw of _†Cænopus_,\r\n_A_, adult; _B_, immature animal (after Osborn). _I 1_, first incisor; _I\r\n2_, second incisor; _C_, canine.]\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of _†Trigonias_ was, on the whole, very much like that of\r\nthe succeeding genus, _†Cænopus_, of the middle substage of the White\r\nRiver, but with the important exception that the front foot had four\r\ndigits instead of three. The pollex, or first of the original five,\r\nalmost always the first to disappear, had been suppressed, the third\r\nor median digit was already the largest of the series, both in length\r\nand breadth; the second and fourth, somewhat shorter together made a\r\nsymmetrical pair, while the fifth, though much the most slender of all,\r\nwas still functional and had retained all of its parts. In the hind foot\r\nthe digits had been reduced to three. This arrangement, four toes in\r\nthe manus and three in the pes, is the same as is found in the existing\r\ntapirs and in the Eocene perissodactyls generally, with only two or three\r\nknown exceptions. In the Oligocene, on the other hand, all the genera\r\nexcept the †titanotheres, tapirs, †lophiodonts and †amynodonts were\r\ntridactyl both before and behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.—Left manus of _†Trigonias osborni_. (After\r\nHatcher.)]\r\n\r\nWith _†Trigonias_ the definitely known history of the true rhinoceroses\r\nbreaks off abruptly, and it is possible that that genus was an immigrant,\r\nthough it is perhaps more likely that its ancestors existed in the\r\nupper and middle Eocene (Uinta and Bridger stages) of North America.\r\nSome fragmentary specimens from the Uinta beds, too imperfect for\r\nany definitive identification, are an encouragement to hope that the\r\nforerunner and direct ancestor of _†Trigonias_ may yet be discovered in\r\nthat formation. It is also quite possible that one of the larger species\r\nof the genus _†Hyrachyus_, so abundant in the Bridger and going back to\r\nthe Wind River, may take its place in the same series.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _†Hyracodontidæ. †Cursorial and †Aquatic Rhinoceroses_\r\n\r\nThe luxuriant diversification of the rhinoceros-stem was not exhausted by\r\nthe many phyla of what we have called the true rhinoceroses. Two other\r\nseries, very distinctly marked and rather distantly connected with the\r\nfirst, are yet to be considered. These two series, the †hyracodonts (in\r\nthe narrow sense) and the †amynodonts, ran courses which, in certain\r\nrespects, were singularly alike; both were of North American origin and\r\none, the †hyracodonts, was entirely confined to that continent, while\r\nthe other sent out late migrants, which entered Europe, no doubt through\r\nAsia, and both ended their careers before the close of the White River\r\ntime. Their history was thus a brief one when compared with that of the\r\ntrue rhinoceroses, three phyla of which persist to the present day,\r\nthough their geographical range is greatly restricted in comparison with\r\nwhat it was in the Miocene and Pliocene, when they ranged over every\r\ncontinent except Australia and South America.\r\n\r\nJust how to classify these three series of rhinoceroses and\r\nrhinoceros-like animals, so as most accurately to express their mutual\r\nrelationships, is a question that has received several answers. One\r\nmethod suggested is to include them all in a single family and to make\r\na subfamily for each of the three well-distinguished series; this is\r\nthe arrangement which personally I should prefer. A second plan is to\r\naccord family rank to each of the three groups; while the most elaborate\r\nscheme, that of Professor Osborn, is as follows: for the rhinoceroses,\r\nin the broader sense, he makes two families, the Rhinocerotidæ and the\r\n†Hyracodontidæ, and divides the former into four subfamilies, which\r\ninclude all of the true rhinoceroses, living and extinct, of the Old and\r\nNew Worlds, and the latter into two subfamilies, the †Hyracodontinæ and\r\n†Amynodontinæ. It is not a matter of very great moment as to which of\r\nthese three schemes is followed, and I shall therefore adopt the one\r\nproposed by Professor Osborn, in order to avoid, so far as possible, the\r\nconfusing effect of different methods of classification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.—†Cursorial rhinoceros (_†Hyracodon\r\nnebrascensis_), White River stage. Restored from a skeleton in the Museum\r\nof Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, the subfamily of the †hyracodonts (†Hyracodontinæ)\r\nbecame extinct in White River times, during most of which it was\r\nrepresented by the single genus _†Hyracodon_, whence are derived the\r\nnames for the family and subfamily. The series was purely North American,\r\nand no member of it has ever been found in any other continent. The\r\nspecies of _†Hyracodon_ were altogether different in appearance and\r\nproportions from the true rhinoceroses, being lightly built, slender,\r\ncursorial creatures, suggestive rather of horses than of rhinoceroses,\r\nto which they bore much the same relation as the slender-limbed,\r\nnarrow-footed †lophiodonts did to the tapirs (_see_ p. 326); in size,\r\nthey were somewhat taller and considerably heavier than a sheep.\r\n\r\nThe low-crowned grinding teeth had the unmistakable rhinoceros-pattern,\r\nand between them and the teeth of the contemporary _†Cænopus_ the\r\ndifference was merely one of size, except for one small, but not\r\ninsignificant feature. The last upper molar had not perfectly acquired\r\nthe triangular form characteristic of all the true rhinoceroses, caused\r\nby the complete fusion of the outer wall with the posterior crest, but\r\nthe wall projected a little behind the crest, as in perissodactyls\r\ngenerally. Premolars (except the first) and molars were alike in\r\nstructure and of nearly the same size. While the grinding teeth were\r\nthus hardly to be distinguished from those of the true rhinoceroses, the\r\nanterior teeth, incisors and canines, were totally different; they were\r\nvery small and had simple, pointed and slightly recurved crowns, and\r\nwere all very much alike in size and form. Thus, there were in the front\r\nof the mouth eight small, hook-like teeth, above and below, which were\r\nobviously quite useless as weapons; and as the skull had no horn, the\r\nanimal was defenceless, and must have depended entirely upon speed for\r\nits safety from the attacks of the larger and more powerful beasts of\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nThe skull was short, deep and thick, and the head must have been heavy\r\nand clumsy, quite out of keeping with the body and limbs. The neck was\r\nsurprisingly long, longer indeed proportionately than in the contemporary\r\ngenus of horses (_†Mesohippus_), but the neck-vertebræ were relatively\r\nstout and strong, as was required for the muscles to move and control\r\nthe heavy head. The body was rather elongate, but not deep or massive,\r\nand the limbs were proportionately much longer than in any of the\r\nknown rhinoceroses. The limb-bones, one and all, despite their length\r\nand slenderness, bore an unquestionable likeness to those of the true\r\nrhinoceroses. In this elongation of the limbs the fore-arm and thigh were\r\nthe parts most affected, and the slenderness, though in notable contrast\r\nto the proportions both of the true rhinoceroses and the †amynodonts, was\r\nyet much less marked than in the middle Eocene representatives of the\r\n†hyracodonts themselves. The feet were long and narrow, approximating,\r\nthough not actually attaining the proportions of the feet in the White\r\nRiver horses (_†Mesohippus_). There were three digits in each foot, and\r\nthe median toe (third of the original five) was so much enlarged and the\r\nlateral toes (second and fourth) so reduced, though still functional,\r\nas strongly to suggest a monodactyl foot as the outcome of this course\r\nof development, had not the early extinction of the subfamily put an\r\nend to it. It is interesting to reflect that, had the †lophiodonts and\r\n†hyracodonts continued their existence to the present time and had\r\npersisted in advancing along their particular lines of specialization, we\r\nshould, in all probability, have had monodactyl tapirs and rhinoceroses,\r\nas well as horses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.—Left manus of †cursorial rhinoceroses. _A_,\r\n_†Triplopus cubitalis_ (after Cope), upper Bridger. _B_, _†Hyracodon\r\nnebrascensis_, White River.]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of so many other mammalian series, the †hyracodonts of the\r\nbut partially explored Uinta formation are still very imperfectly known.\r\nAlmost all that can be positively stated about them is that they were\r\nsmaller than their White River successors and that the assumption of the\r\nmolar-pattern by the premolars was incomplete. In the upper Bridger beds\r\nalso not very much is known regarding the then representatives of the\r\nseries, (_†Triplopus_). So much is clear, however, that they were still\r\nsmaller and lighter animals, that the limbs were very light, and that the\r\nnumber of digits in the fore foot had already been reduced to three, the\r\nonly known Bridger perissodactyl of which this is true, all the others\r\nhaving four digits in the manus and three in the pes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.—Primitive †cursorial rhinoceros (_†Hyrachyus\r\neximius_), lower Bridger. Restored from a skeleton in the American Museum\r\nof Natural History.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle and lower Bridger, and even in the Wind River, occurs a\r\ngenus (_†Hyrachyus_) which contained a large number of species, ranging\r\nin size from a full-grown modern tapir to creatures no larger than foxes.\r\nIt is among these smaller species that the most ancient member of the\r\n†hyracodont line is to be sought, though it is not yet practicable to\r\nselect any particular one. _†Hyrachyus_, indeed, may very possibly have\r\ncontained among its many species the ancestors of all three lines of the\r\nrhinoceroses and rhinoceros-like animals, and thus formed the starting\r\npoint from which they developed in diverging series. It is always a very\r\nsignificant fact when two or more groups approach one another the more\r\nclosely, the farther back in time they are traced, because that can only\r\nbe interpreted to mean that ultimately they converged into a common\r\nterm, even though that common ancestor should elude discovery.\r\n\r\n_†Hyrachyus_ may be described as a generalized, relatively\r\nundifferentiated perissodactyl, from which almost any other family of the\r\norder, except the horses and the †titanotheres, might have been derived.\r\nThe incisors, present in undiminished number, were well developed and\r\nfunctional, but not large, and the canines were moderately enlarged,\r\nforming small tusks. The premolars were all smaller and less complex than\r\nthe molars, which had a strong resemblance to those of the tapirs; in\r\nthe lower jaw they were identical with the latter, but in the upper jaw\r\nthere was more than a suggestion of likeness to the rhinoceroses. The\r\nskull was long, narrow and low, hornless, and with thin, slender nasals\r\nand straight, horizontal upper contour. The neck was short, the body very\r\nlong and the limbs of medium length and weight; though relatively stouter\r\nthan in _†Triplopus_ of the upper Bridger and Uinta beds, they cannot be\r\ncalled heavy. The feet were not especially elongate and rather slender;\r\nthe manus had four toes and the pes three.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.—Skull of _†Hyrachyus_. (After Osborn.)]\r\n\r\nA brief and short-lived branch of this stock existed in the Bridger\r\nstage, but was not, so far as is known, represented in any of the\r\nsubsequent stages, and was made up of a single genus (_†Colonoceras_)\r\nwhich had a small pair of dermal horns upon the nasal bones. In other\r\nrespects, it was like _†Hyrachyus_. It is surprising to find that the\r\nhorned series should have so speedily died out, while the defenceless\r\nforms not only persisted, but actually became more defenceless through\r\nthe reduction of the canine tusks. _À priori_, one would have expected\r\nthe opposite result, but the key to the enigma is probably to be found in\r\nthe more perfect adaptation of the surviving kinds to swift running.\r\n\r\nThe second subdivision (†Amynodontinæ) of this family contains a series\r\nof animals which developed in a very divergent fashion and went to\r\nquite the opposite extreme from the cursorial †hyracodonts, resembling\r\nthe latter (aside from the fundamental characteristics common to all\r\nrhinoceroses, in the broadest sense of that term) only in the pattern\r\nof the molar teeth and in the absence of horns. The terminal member of\r\nthe †amynodont series was a White River genus (_†Metamynodon_) of which\r\nthe remains have been found almost exclusively in the consolidated and\r\ncemented sands filling the old river-channels of the middle substage\r\nof the White River beds. This fact, together with certain structural\r\nfeatures of the skull and skeleton, leads at once to the suggestion\r\nthat these animals were chiefly aquatic in their habits and somewhat\r\nlike hippopotamuses in mode of life. _†Metamynodon_ was quite a large\r\nanimal, the heaviest and most massive creature of its time, after the\r\ndisappearance of the giant †titanotheres, but was low and short-legged.\r\n\r\nThe true rhinoceroses, save those which, like the existing African\r\nspecies, have lost all the front teeth, all agree in the peculiar\r\ndifferentiation of the incisors, which was fully described in the\r\npreceding section of this chapter. The †hyracodonts had a second scheme,\r\nthe incisors and canines being all similar in shape, small, pointed and\r\nrecurved, while still a third mode of development was exemplified by the\r\n†amynodonts, in which the canines became large and formidable tusks, a\r\nvery notable difference from all other rhinoceroses whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.—Supposedly †aquatic rhinoceros (_†Metamynodon\r\nplanifrons_) of the White River. Restored from a skeleton in the American\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nIn _†Metamynodon_ the incisors were not enlarged, but were unreduced and\r\nfunctional; the upper canine was a short, heavy tusk, obliquely truncated\r\nby the abrasion of the lower tusk, which was very large. Another striking\r\ndifference from all the other groups of rhinoceroses was the reduction\r\nof the premolar teeth, which, instead of equalling the molars in size,\r\nwere much smaller and were diminished to three in the upper, two in the\r\nlower jaw. The molars were of the characteristic rhinoceros-pattern,\r\nbut were very narrow, especially the inferior ones, in which the enamel\r\ndid not surround the whole crown, as it normally does, but was lacking\r\nalong vertical bands, where the dentine formed the surface. The skull\r\nwas extremely peculiar and, with its very long and high sagittal crest\r\nand immensely expanded and heavy zygomatic arches, had a surprising\r\nlikeness to the skull of some great beast of prey. The face was very much\r\nshortened and the skull depressed, so that the head was remarkably low,\r\nbroad and flat, proportions which did not recur in any other group of\r\nrhinoceroses. The neck was short, the body very long and very massive, as\r\nis shown by the long and strongly arched ribs. The limbs were short and\r\nstout and the feet quite primitive in character, the front foot retaining\r\nfour fully developed and functional digits. No other perissodactyls of\r\nthe middle White River beds, except the †lophiodonts and tapirs, had more\r\nthan three digits in the manus, and thus _†Metamyodon_ was a belated\r\nexception to the general rule.\r\n\r\nThe Uinta member of this series was _†Amynodon_, a similar but smaller\r\nand lighter animal. The canine tusks were of more moderate size and none\r\nof the premolars had been lost, but were considerably smaller than the\r\nmolars, and the last two had assumed the molar-pattern. The face was\r\nnot conspicuously shortened and the zygomatic arches of the skull were\r\nnot so heavy or so widely expanded as in the White River genus, and the\r\nskeleton was less massive.\r\n\r\nThe genus _†Amynodon_ is also represented in the upper Bridger beds, but\r\nby a species different from that of the Uinta stage. This more ancient\r\nspecies was a smaller animal than its upper Eocene successor and had less\r\nenlarged canine tusks, but it already possessed the typical rhinoceros\r\nmolar teeth, the only Bridger mammal of which this is true. Beyond this\r\nspecies the line, as at present understood, cannot be traced, though\r\nprobably some species of _†Hyrachyus_, or an allied genus, will prove to\r\nbe the ancestor sought; but the connecting link has not yet been brought\r\nto light.\r\n\r\nThe history of the rhinoceroses and rhinoceros-like animals, of which\r\na very much simplified sketch has just been given, is a highly complex\r\none, much more so than that of the horses, †titanotheres, or tapirs,\r\nand is less fully recorded, the earlier chapters of the story being\r\nstill missing. However, in the progress of discovery these chapters will\r\nalmost certainly be recovered, and it is already possible to draw close\r\ninferences as to what they will reveal. The complexity of the history is\r\nchiefly due to the fact that, as compared with the other perissodactyl\r\ngroups, the rhinoceros stem ramified more widely and gave rise to\r\nmore divergent and diversified forms. At one extreme, we find huge,\r\nmassive, slow-moving types; and, at the other, light, slender, cursorial\r\ncreatures, almost horse-like in appearance, with intermediate forms of\r\nmoderate size. Some were long and others short legged, mostly adapted to\r\nterrestrial life, but some with aquatic habits. The three very different\r\nsorts of modification which the anterior teeth (incisors and canines)\r\nunderwent in the three principal series may be taken as an illustration\r\nof this divergent development, and to these may be added a fourth, the\r\ncomplete suppression of all the incisors and canines above and below, as\r\nis exemplified by the modern African species.\r\n\r\nOf the three rhinoceros groups, whatever rank be assigned them, family\r\nor subfamily, much the most prolific in divergent forms was that of the\r\ntrue rhinoceroses (Rhinocerotidæ) of which seven or more phyla have been\r\ndistinguished, three of them surviving to the present time. Only in this\r\nseries were horns frequently present, the brief experiment, as it might\r\nbe called, of the Bridger genus _†Colonoceras_, being the only known\r\ninstances of horns among the †hyracodonts, and the †amynodonts were all\r\nhornless. In making the comparison as to degree of ramification among\r\nthe three series, it should be borne in mind that the true rhinoceroses\r\nwere the only long-lived group, the other two dying out before or at\r\nthe end of the White River stage. Within the series or family of the\r\ntrue rhinoceroses, there was no great divergence of type, and all the\r\nmembers were much alike, heavy and slow animals, but with very great\r\nvariety in the details of structure. Take, for instance, the matter of\r\nhorns; we find both hornless and horned genera, the former preceding the\r\nlatter in time, but, so far as North America is concerned, continuing in\r\nassociation with them till the end. Among the horned genera, the horn may\r\nbe single, double in a transverse pair (_†Diceratherium_) or arranged\r\none behind the other in the median line of the head (_Dicerorhinus_,\r\n_Opsiceros_, etc.). The single horn may be on the nose or the forehead;\r\nif on the nose, it may be on the upper side of the nasal bones\r\n(_Rhinoceros_) or on the extreme tip and pointing obliquely forward\r\n(_†Teleoceras_). The single frontal horn was much less common, but in the\r\nextraordinary _†Elasmotherium_, of the European and Siberian Pleistocene,\r\nthe horn was of gigantic size and the surface for its attachment an\r\nenormous, dome-like boss on the forehead.\r\n\r\nAll three of the series had their most ancient known representatives\r\nin North America, and it seems probable, though by no means certain,\r\nthat they all originated here by divergence from a common stock, which\r\nwas represented more or less closely by the genus _†Hyrachyus_ of the\r\nBridger and Wind River stages of the Eocene. However that may be, true\r\nrhinoceroses flourished exceedingly in the Old World from the upper\r\nOligocene to the Pleistocene, the events of the latter epoch restricting\r\nthem to their present range. The significance of the American genera for\r\nthe ancestry of the modern types can be found only in the most ancient\r\nforms, _†Trigonias_ and _†Cænopus_; the subsequent development which\r\nled up to the existing species of Asia and Africa went on entirely\r\nin the eastern hemisphere. The †hyracodont subfamily had no known\r\nrepresentatives outside of North America, but the †amynodonts sent out\r\nemigrants, which appeared for a brief time in the Oligocene of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the varied history of the rhinoceroses, the principles of evolutionary\r\nchange which may be deduced from the recorded development of the horses,\r\ntapirs and †titanotheres are found to be applicable.\r\n\r\n(1) There was the same gradual increase in size from the earlier to the\r\nlater geological stages. Not that all the phyla kept equal pace in this\r\nrespect, and even within the same phylum it was the rule rather than the\r\nexception to find larger and smaller contemporary species.\r\n\r\n(2) In all of the early forms, up to the middle Miocene, the teeth were\r\nlow-crowned; after that time there was a decided increase in the height\r\nof the teeth, though only in _†Elasmotherium_ was the fully hypsodont,\r\ncement-covered crown attained. In the existing African Broad-Lipped\r\nRhinoceros (_Opsiceros simus_), which is a grazing animal, the high,\r\ncement-covered teeth may also fairly be called hypsodont.\r\n\r\n(3) In all of the lines, as in the other perissodactyl families, the\r\npremolars gradually took on the pattern of the molars; only in the\r\n†amynodonts were the premolars notably reduced in number and size.\r\n\r\n(4) The three different modes of development of the anterior teeth,\r\nexemplified by the true rhinoceroses, the †hyracodonts and †amynodonts\r\nrespectively, need not be recapitulated here. It is sufficient to call\r\nattention to the fact that the three kinds of modification diverged\r\nfrom a common starting-point such as may be seen in the middle Eocene\r\nperissodactyls generally, and that in each series the transformation was\r\ngradual.\r\n\r\n(5) The modification of the skull followed several different courses, as\r\ndesignated by the major and minor subdivisions of families, subfamilies\r\nand phyla. The development of horns, whether single or double, in\r\ntransverse or longitudinal pairs, was the most important single influence\r\nin transforming the skull, as determined by the mechanical adjustment\r\nnecessary to make these weapons effective, but even in the hornless\r\nforms changes went on, and in all the phyla the skull departed more and\r\nmore widely from the primitive Eocene type in each succeeding geological\r\nstage. The most aberrant form of skull was that of the hornless and\r\npresumably aquatic _†Metamynodon_, in which the greatly shortened face,\r\nhigh sagittal crest and extremely wide zygomatic arches were altogether\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\n(6) When the history of any horned phylum is at all complete, the\r\ndevelopment of the horns may be followed step by step from the marks\r\nwhich they left upon the skull. As a rule, the story was one of gradual\r\nenlargement, but, in one case at least, an incipient horn apparently\r\nfailed to enlarge and was eventually lost.\r\n\r\n(7) In the light, slender and cursorial †hyracodonts the mode of\r\ndevelopment resembled that of the horses, as appears in the elongation\r\nof the neck, limbs and feet, in the enlargement of the median toe and\r\nconcomitant reduction of the lateral digits. Also, as in the horses, the\r\nelongation of the limbs began to be noteworthy while the body-weight\r\nwas small and was consequently accompanied by great slenderness; as the\r\nbody-weight increased, the limbs became stouter, to yield the necessary\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n(8) In the phyla composed of massive animals the principle of change\r\nagreed with that exemplified by the †titanotheres, increasing\r\nbody-weight being the determining factor in both cases. When this\r\nincrease began to be decided, the reduction of digits ceased at the point\r\nwhich had already been reached in any particular series, three in both\r\nmanus and pes in the true rhinoceroses, four in the manus and three in\r\nthe pes in the †amynodonts. Very heavy animals require broad, columnar\r\nfeet to support them, and hence the similarity of appearance in such\r\nwidely separated groups as elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses,\r\nnot to mention several extinct orders and families. Among the larger and\r\nheavier rhinoceroses, as in those of the present time, there was great\r\nvariety in the proportionate lengths of the limbs, body and feet.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the great complexity of the history of the rhinoceroses is due\r\nto the many divergent and parallel phyla into which these animals may\r\nbe grouped. Broadly speaking, they may be subdivided into the slender,\r\ncursorial types and the heavy, slow-moving types, the former developing\r\nin a manner similar to that shown by the horses, while the latter were\r\nmodified after the fashion of the †titanotheres. Obviously the load to be\r\nsupported by the legs and feet was a very important factor in determining\r\nthe character of evolutionary change.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. †ANCYLOPODA. †CLAWED PERISSODACTYLS\r\n\r\nThe very extraordinary and aberrant animals which are referable to this\r\nsuborder have been understood only since the year 1888, for, as was shown\r\nin an earlier chapter (p. 41) their scattered parts had been assigned to\r\ntwo different mammalian orders, the skull to the perissodactyls and the\r\nfeet to the pangolins, or scaly anteaters (Pholidota) of the Old World,\r\nsince it occurred to no one that the same animal could have such a skull\r\nand teeth in combination with such feet.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Ancylopoda is still very incomplete, only four genera,\r\nof the lower Pliocene, middle and lower Miocene, and the middle Eocene\r\nrespectively, being at all adequately known, but even in this imperfect\r\nform the story is worth telling. The suborder was probably of American\r\norigin and its most ancient known member existed in the middle Eocene.\r\nBoth in Europe and North America the group persisted into the lower\r\nPliocene and it is believed, though not clearly demonstrated, that in\r\neastern Asia it continued even into the Pleistocene. All the genera of\r\nthe suborder may be included in a single family.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _†Chalicotheriidæ. †Chalicotheres_\r\n\r\nThe specimens which so far have been found in the American middle and\r\nupper Miocene and lower Pliocene are very fragmentary, consisting of\r\nlittle more than teeth, and give no information other than to demonstrate\r\nthe presence of the family in North America during that period of time.\r\nOn the other hand, the European genera of the middle Miocene and lower\r\nPliocene are well known and may or may not have been closely similar\r\nto their American contemporaries, though they were undoubtedly larger.\r\nIn these most peculiar and grotesque animals (_†Macrotherium_ and\r\n_†Chalicotherium_) the head was relatively small, the teeth were very\r\nlow-crowned and adapted only to a diet of soft vegetable substances\r\nand the mode of feeding must have been that of browsing upon leaves\r\nand shoots of trees and bushes; the premolars had not acquired the\r\nmolar-pattern, which was very exceptional for perissodactyls of so\r\nlate a time, such a difference between the two classes of teeth being\r\ncharacteristic of the Eocene members of the order; the incisors and\r\ncanines were reduced, but the formula is not definitely known.\r\n\r\nThe neck was of moderate length, the body very long, and the limbs were\r\nalso elongate, especially the anterior pair, in consequence of which the\r\nback sloped downward from the shoulders to the rump; the two fore-arm\r\nbones were fused together, and these, with the thigh-bones, were the\r\nlongest segments of the limbs. The special peculiarity of these animals\r\nwas in the character of the feet, which had three toes, each armed with\r\na huge claw, instead of terminating in a hoof, as it does in all normal\r\nperissodactyls. The external digit, which, in the absence of the fifth,\r\nwas the fourth, was the largest of the series and apparently bore the\r\nmost of the weight, a notable departure from the normal perissodactyl\r\nsymmetry, in which the third or median toe is the largest. The hind feet\r\nwere considerably smaller than the fore, but had similar claws.\r\n\r\nMany suggestions have been offered as to the manner in which these great\r\nclaws were employed. The teeth demonstrate that these animals could not\r\nhave had predaceous habits, but must have been inoffensive plant-feeders.\r\nAs no such herbivorous creatures are living now, it is impossible to\r\nreach a definitive solution of the problem, which is further complicated\r\nby the fact that in two other orders of hoofed mammals, Artiodactyla and\r\n†Toxodontia, a more or less similar transformation of hoofs into claws\r\ntook place, and among the edentates the large, herbivorous †ground-sloths\r\n(†Gravigrada) had enormous claws. It is inadmissible to suppose that\r\nthese great †chalicotheres could have been burrowers, or tree-climbers,\r\nor that they pursued and slaughtered prey of any kind, for, aside from\r\nthe character of the teeth, such heavy and slow-moving beasts would\r\nhave been utterly inefficient at work of that sort. No doubt, the claws\r\nwere used, to some extent, as weapons of defence, as the existing South\r\nAmerican Ant-Bear (_Myrmecophaga jubata_) uses his formidable claws;\r\nprobably also some, if not all, of these clawed ungulates would employ\r\nthe fore feet in digging for roots and tubers, as is done by the bears\r\ngenerally. Many years ago, the late Sir Richard Owen suggested with\r\nreference to the †ground-sloths that the principal use of the fore feet,\r\nother than that of locomotion, was to draw down within reach of the long\r\ntongue and prehensile upper lip the branches upon which they browsed.\r\nThis explanation may perhaps be applicable to all of these aberrant and\r\nexceptional groups of hoofed animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.—Left manus of lower Miocene †chalicothere\r\n(_†Moropus_). (After Peterson.)]\r\n\r\nIn the lower Miocene (Arikaree stage) of North America well-nigh complete\r\nskeletons of a large †chalicothere (_†Moropus_, Fig. 130, p. 240) have\r\nbeen obtained, an animal which considerably exceeded a large horse in\r\nbulk and stature. In structure this genus had departed less widely from\r\nthe normal perissodactyl type than the genera of the European Miocene\r\nand Pliocene above described and was in many respects more primitive.\r\nIt could not, however, have been directly ancestral to the European\r\nforms, though indicating in a general sort of way what the ancestral type\r\nmust have been. _†Moropus_ had a relatively small, slender and pointed\r\nhead, a long neck, much longer than in the European genera, and long\r\nfore legs; the shorter hind legs gave the back a steep inclination from\r\nthe shoulders to the rump. The proportions of the head, neck and limbs\r\nsuggest those of a giraffe, in less exaggerated form, but the likeness\r\nis more marked in the skeleton than in the restoration and is at best\r\na distant one. The feet were armed with the great claws characteristic\r\nof the suborder, but the fore foot, in addition to the three functional\r\ntoes, had a long splint, representing the rudimentary fifth digit; of the\r\nfirst, or pollex, no trace remained. The perissodactyl plan of symmetry\r\nhad not yet been lost, the third or median digit being the longest of\r\nthe series. In the hind foot, which had only three toes, the departure\r\nfrom the perissodactyl arrangement had already begun, and the third and\r\nfourth digits (_i.e._ of the original five) were of nearly equal size,\r\nboth in length and thickness, while the second was smaller.\r\n\r\nThe family is represented in the John Day, or upper Oligocene, by\r\nspecimens which are sufficiently characteristic to prove that they are\r\nproperly referable to this group. They have been assigned to the same\r\ngenus as that of the lower Miocene, but whether the identification is\r\njustified remains to be determined.\r\n\r\nIn the lower White River beds of Canada is found a much smaller animal\r\nof this family, but the material is too fragmentary for generic\r\nidentification. Something more is known of a genus (_†Schizotherium_)\r\nfrom the European Oligocene, likewise much smaller than the Miocene and\r\nPliocene forms, which had four, or possibly even five, functional digits,\r\nin the manus, but it has not been ascertained whether the transformation\r\nof hoofs into claws had already taken place.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet practicable to determine the relationships of the European\r\nand American †chalicotheres to one another, because of the imperfect\r\nnature of most of the material.\r\n\r\nThe molar teeth of the †chalicotheres were suggestively like those of the\r\n†titanotheres, and, were the teeth alone to be taken into account, no one\r\ncould hesitate to regard the two families as closely related.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient known member of the family is the genus _†Eomoropus_,\r\nfrom the Bridger Eocene, which will be described by Professor Osborn\r\nin a paper soon to appear. _†Eomoropus_ was much nearer to the normal\r\nperissodactyls than were the genera from the Oligocene and Miocene above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE ARTIODACTYLA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe artiodactyls are and for a very long time have been a very much\r\nlarger and more variegated group than the perissodactyls, and the Old\r\nWorld has been and still is their headquarters and area of special\r\ndevelopment, where they are represented in far greater number and variety\r\nthan in the New; the perissodactyls, on the other hand, flourished\r\nespecially in North America, as was shown in the preceding chapter. At\r\nthe present time the artiodactyls are the dominant ungulate order, far\r\noutnumbering all the others combined, and include an assemblage of varied\r\ntypes, which, when superficially examined, appear to be an arbitrary\r\nand unnatural group. What could seem more unlike than a dainty little\r\nmouse-deer, no larger than a hare, a stag, a camel, a giraffe, a bison\r\nand a hippopotamus? Yet, in spite of this wonderful diversity of size,\r\nproportions, appearance and habits, there is a genuine unity of structure\r\nthroughout the order, which makes their association in a single group\r\naltogether natural and proper, especially as these structural characters\r\nare not found united in any other group.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to enumerate all of the diagnostic characters\r\nwhich, on the one hand, unite all the living and extinct artiodactyls\r\nand, on the other, distinguish them from all other hoofed animals, and it\r\nwill suffice to mention a few of the more significant of these features.\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, the artiodactyls typically have an even number of\r\ntoes in each foot, four or two; though this rule may be departed from\r\nand we find members of the order with five digits or three, just as the\r\ntapirs and nearly all the Eocene genera of perissodactyls had four toes\r\nin the manus. Much more important is the fact that the plane of symmetry,\r\nwhich in the perissodactyls bisects the third digit and is therefore\r\nsaid to be _mesaxonic_, passes between the third and fourth digit and\r\nis _paraxonic_. The third and fourth digits always form an equal and\r\nsymmetrical pair and are the “irreducible minimum,” beyond which the\r\nnumber of toes cannot be diminished. A single-toed artiodactyl would seem\r\nto be an anatomical impossibility; at all events, such a monstrosity was\r\nnever known. Hence the term “cloven” or “divided” hoof, which seems to\r\ntake the solid hoof of the horse as the norm; but “cloven or divided,”\r\nwhile expressing the appearance of the foot with sufficient accuracy, is\r\nerroneous, if taken to mean the splitting of what was once continuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.—Left fore-arm bones of the Domestic Pig (_Sus\r\nscrofa_). _R._, radius. _U._, ulna. _ol._, olecranon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.—Left manus of Pig. _S._, scaphoid. _L._, lunar.\r\n_Py._, pyramidal. _Pis._, pisiform. _Td._, trapezoid. _M._, magnum. _U._,\r\nunciform. _Mc.

The ankle-bone, or astragalus, has\r\na double pulley, the upper and lower ends being of quite similar\r\nshape; its lower end is almost equally divided between the cuboid and\r\nnavicular, which are made concave to receive it. This type of astragalus\r\nis altogether peculiar to the artiodactyls, all of which possess it;\r\nit is unlike that of any other mammal whatever and may be recognized\r\nat a glance. The calcaneum, or heel-bone, has a large convex facet, by\r\nmeans of which it articulates with the fibula, or external leg-bone;\r\nthere is no such articulation in the perissodactyls. The lower end of\r\nthe calcaneum is narrow and fits into a step cut in the cuboid, which\r\nis thus every whit as peculiar and characteristic as the calcaneum and\r\nastragalus. The femur never has the third trochanter, which is always\r\npresent in the perissodactyls. Another respect in which the artiodactyls\r\ndiffer from all perissodactyls except the horses is in the much more\r\ncomplex mode of articulation between the vertebræ of the lumbar and\r\nposterior dorsal regions, which the former display, and even the horses\r\nhave no such elaborate arrangement. Finally, another very marked\r\ndifference from the perissodactyls is in the teeth, for the premolars\r\nand molars are never alike, and only in very rare instances does the\r\nlast premolar assume the molar-pattern. Of this pattern, there are two\r\nprincipal kinds, one exemplified by the peccaries, in which the crown\r\nsupports a series, fundamentally two pairs, of conical cusps, and called\r\n_bunodont_, and the other, to be seen in all the ruminating animals, in\r\nwhich the crown is composed of two pairs of crescents and is therefore\r\nsaid to be _selenodont_. The bunodont was the primitive type, whence the\r\nother was derived, and many transitional forms are known.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the immense horde of living and extinct genera and\r\nspecies which are referable to the artiodactyls is an extremely difficult\r\nproblem, which has found no thoroughly satisfactory solution and will\r\nnot until much more is learned concerning the history of the order and\r\nconflicting opinions can be reconciled.

SWINE-LIKE ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe history of the American types of pig-like forms is, in one sense,\r\nvery full and complete in that the successive genera may be traced\r\nback to the Eocene, but, in another sense, the story is exasperatingly\r\nimperfect, because so much of the material is fragmentary. Of most of the\r\ngenera, nothing is known but teeth and jaws, and these, though sufficient\r\nfor identification, tell but little of the structural changes which it\r\nis desirable to know. It is merely a question of time, when more adequate\r\nmaterial will be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Tagassuidæ. Peccaries_\r\n\r\nThe peccaries, or American swine, are now chiefly of Neotropical\r\ndistribution, extending into the Sonoran region only as far as Arkansas;\r\nbut this has been true only since the Pleistocene, for nearly the\r\nentire history of the family has been enacted in North America. In many\r\npoints of structure the peccaries of the present day are more advanced\r\nand specialized than the far more varied and diversified true swine of\r\nthe Old World, for it is a singular fact that such a long-lived and\r\npersistent stock as the peccaries should have given rise to so few\r\nvariants and side-branches. Existing peccaries all belong to a single\r\ngenus (_Tagassu_) and are relatively small animals, of unmistakably\r\npig-like character and appearance, but far smaller than the Wild Boar\r\n(_Sus scrofa_) of Europe, or the Wart Hog (_Phacochœrus æthiopicus_) of\r\nAfrica, to mention only two of the Old World swine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191.—Dentition of the Collared Peccary (_Tagassu\r\ntajacu_) left side. _i 3_, external incisor. _C_, canine, _p 2_, second\r\npremolar (the first is lost), _m 1_, first molar.]\r\n\r\nOne characteristic and thoroughgoing difference between the peccaries and\r\nthe swine is the shape of the canine tusks. In the former, the tusks,\r\nthough very effective weapons, are not very large and are straight and\r\nhave a vertical direction, while in all the true swine the upper tusk\r\nis curved upward and outward, projecting strongly from the side of the\r\njaw, and the great, curved lower tusk wears against its anterior side.\r\nThe peccaries further have smaller and simpler molars, each with four\r\nprincipal, conical cusps (quadrituberculate pattern) arranged in two\r\ntransverse pairs, with numerous very small cuspules around and between\r\nthem, obscuring the plan. In the true swine the teeth are much larger\r\nand covered with innumerable wart-like cusps, large and small, seldom\r\narranged according to any definite plan.\r\n\r\nIn the following particulars the modern peccaries show advance over\r\nthe Old World swine: (1) the last lower premolar has taken on the\r\nmolar-pattern, a very exceptional feature among the artiodactyls; (2) the\r\nulna and radius are coössified; (3) there are but two functional digits\r\nin each foot; the fore foot has, in addition, two complete, but very\r\nreduced and slender, lateral digits and the hind foot only one, whereas\r\nin all the pigs of the eastern hemisphere there are four functional toes\r\nin each foot; (4) in the hind foot the two functional metatarsals, the\r\nthird and fourth, have coalesced to form a “cannon-bone,” a structure\r\nwhich is not found in any other family of the suborder; (5) the stomach\r\nis complex, approximating that of a ruminant.\r\n\r\nIn the North American Pleistocene the predominating kind of peccary was\r\na genus (_†Platygonus_) which was more advanced than the existing form\r\n(_Tagassu_), and, to all seeming, better fitted to survive, though for\r\nsome inexplicable reason it failed to do so. It was a considerably larger\r\nanimal, with proportionately longer and heavier legs. Its molar teeth\r\nare of special interest because they reproduced a type which has been so\r\noften repeated and independently acquired in so many different groups\r\nof mammals. In this molar the two conical cusps of each pair were fused\r\ninto a high, transverse ridge or crest. Precisely the same modification\r\ntook place among the true swine in the genus _†Listriodon_ of the French\r\nmiddle Miocene. _†Platygonus_ first appeared in the middle Pliocene,\r\nand its predecessor in the lower Pliocene and upper Miocene showed the\r\ncrests of the molars in process of formation. In the latter stage it was\r\naccompanied by a true peccary with tuberculated teeth, which differed\r\nfrom the modern species in the simplicity of the hindmost premolar, which\r\nhad not taken on the molar-pattern. If the feet and limbs of this upper\r\nMiocene peccary were known, they would doubtless prove to be much more\r\nprimitive than those of _Tagassu_, but they still await discovery.\r\n\r\nLittle can be said of the peccaries of the middle and lower Miocene\r\nother than to record the fact of their presence in those formations, but\r\nthose of the upper Oligocene (John Day) are, however, represented by\r\nwell-preserved skulls, which show that more than one phylum of the family\r\nhad arisen, though there was no great difference between them; they were\r\nconsiderably smaller animals than those of the Pliocene and Pleistocene.\r\nStill smaller was the White River genus (_†Perchœrus_) of which some\r\nfragmentary skeletons have been obtained. Although an undoubted peccary,\r\nthis animal was not far from what the common progenitor of the peccaries\r\nand the true swine might be expected to resemble. The molars were\r\nquadrituberculate without the numerous accessory cuspules of the modern\r\ngenus; the bones of the fore-arm were separate and the feet had four\r\nfunctional digits each, while there was no cannon-bone in the pes, the\r\nmetatarsals remaining free.\r\n\r\nNo peccaries have yet been found in the Uinta, but probably this is a\r\nmere accident of collecting. It is, however, possible that the White\r\nRiver genus was not of American derivation, but an immigrant from the\r\nOld World. In the middle Eocene, or Bridger stage, this series is known\r\nonly from teeth and jaws and a very few scattered foot-bones, and these,\r\nthough probably referable to the family, cannot be definitively assigned\r\nto it without more complete material. Several species, larger and\r\nsmaller, of the genus _†Helohyus_ occurred in the Bridger, where they\r\nwere not uncommon, considering the general rarity of artiodactyls in that\r\nstage. Thus, the peccaries, though none of them were large, followed the\r\nusual law of mammalian development, and, beginning with very small forms,\r\nincreased in size with each succeeding geological stage down to the\r\nPleistocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _†Entelodontidæ. †Giant Pigs_\r\n\r\nThe †giant pigs, a most remarkable group of swine-like forms and of as\r\nyet unknown origin, appeared for the last time in North America in the\r\nlower Miocene, where the genus of that date (_†Dinohyus_) was the largest\r\nof known suilline animals, the hippopotamuses excepted. In nearly every\r\npart of the skeleton these great beasts displayed an unusual and aberrant\r\nkind of development. The incisors were long and pointed, and the canines\r\nformed stout and heavy, though not very long, tusks, which in shape\r\nwere more like those of a bear than those of either peccaries or swine.\r\nThe premolars were very simple, of compressed conical and trenchant\r\nshape, and occupied a very long space in the jaws, while the molars\r\nwere relatively small and quadrituberculate, the crowns covered with\r\nvery thick, coarsely wrinkled enamel. The skull was immensely elongate,\r\nespecially the facial region in front of the eyes, while the brain-case\r\nwas so absurdly small as to give the skull a reptilian aspect, when\r\nviewed from above. Evidently, these great pigs were profoundly stupid,\r\nin this respect rivalling the †titanotheres of the White River (p. 311).\r\nBeneath each eye-socket was a long, descending, bony flap, or process,\r\nand on the under side of the lower jaw were two pairs of prominent\r\nknobs, the function of which, as of the flaps beneath the eyes, is quite\r\nproblematical. The eye-sockets themselves were completely encircled in\r\nbone, a rare character in the suborder.\r\n\r\nThe neck was short, as in the pigs generally, the body not very elongate\r\nand the tail of moderate length; at the shoulders, the spines of the\r\ndorsal vertebræ were very long, making a decided hump, and in the lumbar\r\nand posterior dorsal region the processes for articulation between the\r\nvertebræ were extremely elaborate. For one of the pigs, the limbs were\r\nvery long and gave quite a stilted look to the animal. As in the modern\r\npeccaries, the fore-arm bones were indistinguishably fused together\r\nand the feet had only two toes each, the only members of the suborder\r\nin which digital reduction had proceeded so far, though the existing\r\npeccaries approximate this condition. There were, however, nodular\r\nvestiges of two other digits, which prove the derivation of this form\r\nfrom at least a four-toed type; no cannon-bone was formed. In view of the\r\nsize of the animal, the hoofs were surprisingly small, which suggests\r\nthat the weight was chiefly borne upon a pad. _†Dinohyus_ was a very\r\nlarge animal, six feet or more in height at the shoulder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.—Right manus of †entelodont (_†Archæotherium\r\ningens_) from lower White River beds. Princeton University Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193.—Skull of White River †entelodont\r\n(_†Archæotherium mortoni_). Princeton University Museum. For restoration,\r\nsee Fig. 137, p. 260.]\r\n\r\nIn the upper Oligocene were very large species of another, but\r\nclosely similar, genus (_†Boöchœrus_) though somewhat smaller than\r\nthose of _†Dinohyus_, and the species of the upper White River beds\r\n(_†Archæotherium_) were little, if at all, smaller than those of the John\r\nDay. A number of specimens in the museum of Princeton University throw\r\na welcome light upon the habits of these strange creatures. In one, the\r\nexternal, or third, upper incisor tooth has a deep, triangular notch worn\r\nin its postero-external face, and the lower canine has a well-defined\r\ngroove worn on the posterior side at the base of the crown; other\r\nindividuals show less distinct marks of similar kind. (See Fig. 194.) It\r\nis out of the question to suppose that these grooves and notches could\r\nhave been produced by abrasion with other teeth, for no other teeth could\r\nreach the worn areas, and it is altogether probable that they were made\r\nin digging up roots. The root, held firmly in the ground at both ends\r\nand looped over the teeth which pulled until it broke, and being covered\r\nwith abrasive grit, would wear just such marks as the teeth actually\r\ndisplay.[7] While the †entelodonts were thus rooters, they were doubtless\r\nomnivorous, like other pigs, and did not disdain a meal of carrion when\r\nthey could get it. It is likely that the heavy canine tusks were also\r\nused as weapons, both in defence against the attacks of carnivores and\r\nin fighting between the males of the same species. It must have been in\r\nsome such encounter that the animal represented by a complete skeleton in\r\nthe Princeton Museum received its broken rib; that the fracture was made\r\nduring life is demonstrated by the large callus growths on the broken\r\nends, but the pieces did not knit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194.—Specimen showing characteristic grooves of wear\r\nin the anterior teeth of †entelodont (_†Archæotherium_) from upper White\r\nRiver beds. Princeton University Museum.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle and lower substages of the White River the genus\r\n(_†Archæotherium_) was the same as in the upper substage of these\r\nbeds, but the species were all smaller and some of them very much so,\r\nnot exceeding an ordinary pig in size. Throughout the series, as we\r\nnow have it, from the lower Oligocene into the lower Miocene, there\r\nis very little change except in size, all the essential features of\r\nstructure remaining the same; the genera are therefore distinguished by\r\nmodifications of very secondary importance, and it is a question whether\r\nall the species should not be included in a single genus. The European\r\ngenus _†Entelodon_, which gives its name to the family, is so like the\r\nAmerican forms that by most writers the White River species are referred\r\nto it. It is of interest to note that the †giant pigs have also been\r\nfound in the marine Miocene of New Jersey, one of the few records of the\r\nTertiary land mammals of the Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\nAt present, the †entelodonts proper cannot be traced back of the lower\r\nWhite River beds, nor are they found in any more ancient formations in\r\nEurope. It is, therefore, probable that they were immigrants in both of\r\nthese continents, presumably from Asia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195.—Skull of †short-faced pig (_†Achænodon\r\nrobustus_) from the Bridger Eocene. Princeton University Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe whole Eocene of North America had a series of pig-like animals,\r\ncalled the †achænodonts or †short-faced pigs, which seem to have been\r\nrelated to the †entelodonts. They ended their career in the Uinta just\r\nbefore the appearance of the †entelodonts, and it would be natural to\r\nsuppose that the latter were descended from them. If, however, the\r\nprinciple that an organ or structure once lost can never be regained,\r\nis valid, then there can be no relation of ancestor and descendant\r\nbetween the two groups, for of the †achænodonts, even their most ancient\r\nrepresentatives had lost the first premolar, giving the formula _p_ 3/3,\r\nwhile in the †entelodonts it is constantly _p_ 4/4. The †achænodonts,\r\nwhich are much less fully known than the †entelodonts, had teeth very\r\nsimilar in form to those of the latter; and their most conspicuous\r\nfeature was the shortness of the face and jaws, as contrasted with the\r\nextreme elongation of these parts in the †entelodonts, nor did they have\r\nthe bony flaps under the eyes or the knobs on the lower jaw which gave\r\nsuch a fantastic appearance to the †entelodont skull. Little is known of\r\nthe skeleton except that there were four functional digits in the manus.\r\nThe Uinta and Bridger genus (_†Achænodon_) was larger than the Wasatch\r\nform (_†Parahyus_), which was an immigrant, probably from the same region\r\nas afterwards sent out the †entelodonts to America and Europe; this\r\nwould account for the similarity and probable relationship of the two\r\nsubfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ARTIODACTYLA †PRIMITIVA. †PRIMITIVE ARTIODACTYLS\r\n\r\nNo doubt, this suborder is an artificial assemblage of unrelated\r\nfamilies, a sort of waste-basket, into which are thrown the groups of\r\nwhich no other disposition can be made in the present state of knowledge.\r\nAs information becomes more complete, the various families will be\r\nredistributed among the groups with which they had a genuine relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _†Anthracotheriidæ. †Anthracotheres_\r\n\r\nThis family was abundantly represented in Europe from the middle Eocene\r\nthrough the Oligocene, in Asia persisting even into the Pliocene, and\r\nwere abundant in the Oligocene of Egypt. Migrants from the Old World\r\nreached America in White River times, but speedily died out, as they\r\ndid not survive into the upper Oligocene. The most fully known of these\r\nanimals is an American species of a European genus _†Bothriodon_. Almost\r\ncomplete skeletons of this genus have been obtained in the channel\r\nsandstones of the upper White River substage. In size and proportions,\r\n_†Bothriodon_ was not unlike a domestic pig, but had a very long head\r\nwith slender, pointed snout; it had also a short neck, long body, short\r\nlimbs and feet. The primitive character of this genus is made clear\r\nby many features of its structure; the molar teeth were extremely\r\nlow-crowned and their cusps were so imperfectly crescentic in form as to\r\nbe called _buno-selenodont_, as indicating their transitional nature,\r\nand the upper molars had five cusps instead of four, a very primitive\r\nfeature. Another very significant character was the five-toed manus; the\r\nfirst digit, or pollex, was much smaller than the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196.—_†Bothriodon brachyrhynchus_, upper White River\r\nstage. Restored from a skeleton in the museum of Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nThe second genus of the family which had American representatives was\r\n_†Anthracotherium_, which was much like _†Bothriodon_, but even more\r\narchaic in character; the molars could hardly be called selenodont at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _†Oreodontidæ. †Oreodonts_\r\n\r\nThis was one of the most characteristic of North American artiodactyl\r\nfamilies, and its members were exceedingly abundant throughout the upper\r\nEocene, the whole Oligocene and Miocene, ending their long career in\r\nthe lower Pliocene. In distribution the family was exclusively North\r\nAmerican, and no trace of it has been found in any other continent.\r\nIn the course of their long history the †oreodonts underwent many\r\ntransformations and branched out into several distinct phyla, yet\r\nthrough all these changes they remained singularly conservative, for the\r\ntransformations, some of them sufficiently bizarre, affected chiefly the\r\nteeth and skull, the remainder of the skeleton changing but little. The\r\n†oreodonts were all small or of moderate size, none of them surpassing\r\nthe Wild Boar in stature, nor was there any decided increase in size from\r\nstage to stage. One and all, they were strange beasts. Dr. Leidy, who\r\nfirst described and named most of the genera, spoke of them as combining\r\nthe characters of camel, deer and pig, and called them “ruminating hogs,”\r\na conception expressed in the names which he gave to some of them, such\r\nas _†Merychyus_ and _†Merycochœrus_, both of which mean ruminant swine.\r\n\r\nThe general proportions of most of the species were quite as in the\r\npeccaries, though, for the most part, with much longer tails; they\r\nhad a short neck, elongate body, short limbs and feet. In one genus\r\n(_†Mesoreodon_) of the lower Miocene a rudimentary collar-bone has been\r\nfound, and probably all of the more ancient genera possessed it, but\r\nonly by an unusually lucky chance would so small and loosely attached a\r\nbone be preserved in place. As the collar-bone is superfluous in hoofed\r\nanimals, in which the limbs are used only for locomotion and move in\r\nplanes parallel with that of the backbone, it is almost universally\r\nabsent in them, and in only one other group of ungulates, the extinct\r\n†Typotheria of South America, has its presence been demonstrated. In\r\nall of the †oreodonts the bones of the fore-arm and lower leg remained\r\nseparate. The teeth were in continuous series, and there was a peculiar\r\nfeature in the dentition common to nearly every one of the genera.\r\nOn casual examination, one would say that the animals had four lower\r\nincisors on each side and that the lower canine closed behind the upper\r\none, a most exceptional arrangement. More careful study shows that the\r\napparent fourth incisor was the canine, a transformation which has also\r\ntaken place in all of the ruminants except the camels, and the tooth\r\nwhich had assumed the form and function of the lower canine was really\r\nthe first lower premolar; this latter change is not found among the\r\nruminants, but was repeated in a few other extinct families.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197.—Head of _†Merycochœrus proprius_, lower Miocene\r\nto lower Pliocene. Restored from a skull in the American Museum of\r\nNatural History.]\r\n\r\nOnly two genera of †oreodonts (_†Merychyus_ and _†Merycochœrus_) survived\r\ninto the lower Pliocene. Both had the proportions common throughout the\r\nfamily, but _†Merychyus_ was much more slender and lightly built, its\r\nlateral digits were reduced in size and very thin and it had hypsodont\r\ngrinding teeth; while _†Merycochœrus_ was of larger size (about that of\r\na large domestic pig) and stouter build and had low-crowned teeth; its\r\nhead, however, had a very different appearance, given by the possession\r\nof a short proboscis, the presence of which is indicated by the greatly\r\nreduced nasal bones; the jaws and face were also much shortened. The\r\neye-sockets presented obliquely forward and upward, instead of laterally,\r\nas is usual among mammals, and were placed high in the head. This\r\nposition of the eyes and of the entrance to the ear renders it probable\r\nthat _†Merycochœrus_ was largely aquatic in its habits. Both genera had\r\nshort, four-toed feet, as was general throughout the family and in no\r\ngenus did the reduction of digits proceed beyond the loss of the first of\r\nthe original five, the pollex and hallux.\r\n\r\nThe two genera above described, representatives of two distinct phyla\r\nwithin the family, held over, as it were, from the upper Miocene without\r\nessential change. The phylum of the hypsodont and slender _†Merychyus_\r\nwent back, with only minor modifications, into the upper substage\r\nof the lower Miocene, but cannot as yet be traced to an Oligocene\r\nancestry; it is therefore still impossible to say just where and when\r\nit branched off from the main stem of the family. Future discoveries in\r\nthe Oligocene will no doubt clear up this problem. The real terminal\r\nand most highly specialized member of the _†Merycochœrus_ phylum and\r\nthe most extraordinary member of the entire family was confined to the\r\nupper Miocene. The extreme peculiarity of this genus (_†Pronomotherium_)\r\nwas displayed only in the head, which was an exaggeration of the\r\n_†Merycochœrus_ type, the face being excessively shortened and the nasals\r\nso reduced as to show that the proboscis was much better developed than\r\nin the parent genus. The shortening of the face and the great vertical\r\nheight of the skull and lower jaw gave a decided likeness to the skull\r\nof a great ape, though the proboscis would mask any such resemblance in\r\nthe living head. _†Merycochœrus_ itself went back to the upper division\r\nof the lower Miocene, but in the lower division it was replaced by an\r\nancestral genus, _†Promerycochœrus_, which had an elongate face and jaws\r\nand no proboscis; but in other characteristic features, such as the\r\nextreme thickness and roughness of the zygomatic arches, it was like\r\nits descendant. _†Promerycochœrus_ contained the largest known species\r\nof †oreodonts, some of them equalling a Wild Boar in stature, and its\r\nremains are found so abundantly in the middle and lower Miocene and\r\nupper Oligocene, that there must have been great herds of these animals\r\nover the plains. Probably it was itself derived from some of the larger\r\nspecies of _†Eporeodon_ of the upper White River beds, but there is a gap\r\nin the history, due to the fact that the lower part of the John Day is\r\nalmost barren of fossils and the connecting link has not been recovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198.—Head of _†Pronomotherium laticeps_, upper\r\nMiocene. Restored from a skull in the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh.]\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting and significant fact that ancestral and\r\nderivative genera may continue to live side by side in the same region.\r\n_†Promerycochœrus_, it is believed, gave rise to _†Merycochœrus_, but\r\nsurvived with it into the middle Miocene. _†Merycochœrus_, in its turn,\r\nproduced _†Pronomotherium_, and, so far from being replaced by the\r\nlatter, actually outlived it and persisted into the lower Pliocene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199.—_†Promerycochœrus carrikeri_, lower Miocene.\r\nRestored from a skeleton in the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh.]\r\n\r\nA third phylum of the †oreodonts, which appeared for the last time in\r\nthe middle Miocene (genus _†Cyclopidius_), was a series of small and\r\nvery small species, of which the skull was almost as peculiar as that of\r\n_†Pronomotherium_, but in a different fashion. The face was very much\r\nshortened and on each side a great vacuity reduced the nasal bones to\r\nmere splints; the elevated position of the eye-sockets, which projected\r\nabove the forehead, and of the tubular entrance to the ear is an evidence\r\nof an aquatic or amphibious mode of life, such as is illustrated by the\r\nhippopotamuses, which can float almost completely submerged, with only\r\nthe ears, eyes and nostrils above the surface of the water. The tympanic\r\nbullæ (see p. 66) or bony chambers into which the ear-tubes opened, were\r\nof relatively enormous size and added much to the unusual appearance of\r\nthe skull. The incisors were very small and the grinding teeth narrow and\r\ncompletely hypsodont, this and the _†Merychyus_ series being the only two\r\nphyla of the family in which the hypsodont molar was fully acquired. The\r\nremainder of the skeleton differed but little from the type common to the\r\nwhole family, except for a somewhat shorter tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 200.—Skull of _†Leptauchenia nitida_, upper White\r\nRiver.]\r\n\r\nThe animals of this series were common in the middle and lower Miocene\r\nand in the upper substage of the White River, but have not been found in\r\nthe intermediate John Day. This may have been a matter of geographical\r\ndistribution, these creatures not extending west of the main ranges of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. In the upper White River the genus _†Leptauchenia_\r\nis extremely common, but below that level they suddenly and completely\r\nvanish and, as in the case of the _†Merychyus_ phylum, it is not yet\r\npracticable to determine the point in time or space of their branching\r\noff from the main stem of the family. Were the †oreodonts not entirely\r\nconfined to North America, we should, as a matter of course, explain the\r\nseemingly sudden appearance of _†Leptauchenia_ as due to immigration,\r\nand it is entirely possible that the series did actually originate in\r\nsome part of North America which has left no record of its Eocene or\r\nOligocene terrestrial life. On the other hand, no one can imagine that\r\neverything that can be known of the mammals of the middle and lower White\r\nRiver has already been learned, and at any time the sought-for ancestor\r\nof _†Leptauchenia_ may be found in those beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201.—_Leptauchenia nitida_, upper White River.\r\nRestored from a skeleton in the Museum of Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth phylum may be regarded as the main or central stem of the\r\nfamily and was the one which underwent the least change, though it\r\nprobably gave rise to all the other phyla, which branched off from it\r\nat various stages in its history. This series terminated in the middle\r\nMiocene and comprised several genera, all very much alike, in the lower\r\nstages of that epoch. One of these genera (_†Mesoreodon_) displayed a\r\nvery remarkable peculiarity of structure in the ossification of the\r\ngreat cartilage of the larynx, which seems to point to the possession of\r\nuncommon vocal powers. It is impossible to say whether this feature was\r\nconfined to the single genus, or was general in the family, for only in\r\nrare instances would so extremely delicate a structure be preserved. In\r\nthe John Day the genus _†Eporeodon_, which was very abundant, was the\r\nrepresentative of this phylum, and the same, or a closely similar, genus\r\nlived in the latter part of the White River stage.\r\n\r\nIn the middle and lower White River substages †oreodonts are the\r\ncommonest of fossils, so that the collector soon wearies of them (see\r\nFig. 136, p. 259); they must have lived in great herds in the forests\r\nand along the streams. There were several species, varying principally\r\nin size, the largest about as long as a wolf, but with shorter legs, and\r\nthe smallest not so much as half of that size. All belonged to a single\r\ngenus, for which the rigid law of priority compels us to use a most\r\ncumbrous name (_†Merycoidodon_), the widely used term _†Oreodon_ being\r\na synonym. This genus was the central stock of the family, from which\r\nmost, if not all, the others were directly or indirectly derived, though,\r\nas previously pointed out, we cannot in all cases trace the connection.\r\nIn these White River animals the grinding teeth were very low-crowned\r\nand had considerable resemblance to those of a deer; the molars were\r\ntypically selenodont and made up of two pairs of crescentic cusps. The\r\nskull differed little from that of the succeeding genera of this phylum;\r\nthe neck was short, body and tail long. An especially interesting fact is\r\nthat the fore foot had five digits, the first, or pollex, very small and\r\nof no functional value, but complete in all its parts; the hind foot was\r\nfour-toed. In all of the subsequent genera of the family the number of\r\ndigits was uniformly four in both manus and pes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202.—Skull of _†Merycoidodon culbertsoni_, middle\r\nWhite River. (After Leidy.)]\r\n\r\nIn the Uinta stage of the upper Eocene lived the most ancient and\r\nprimitive member of the family yet discovered, the genus _†Protoreodon_,\r\nwhich is in every respect what the ancestor of the White River genus\r\nshould be. The functional transformation of the lower canine into a\r\nfourth incisor and the replacement of the canine by the first lower\r\npremolar had already taken place, but the molars were much more primitive\r\nthan those of the White River and succeeding genera; the crescents\r\nwere thicker and less complete, plainly indicating their derivation\r\nfrom conical cusps, and a small fifth cusp was present between the\r\nanterior pair of the upper molars, as in the †anthracotheres and other\r\nEuropean families of the Artiodactyla †Primitiva. Before the discovery\r\nof _†Protoreodon_, the character of its molars was predicted by Dr.\r\nSchlosser, of Munich. The skull resembled that of the White River genera,\r\nexcept that the eye-socket was open behind, and there was no glandular\r\npit in front of the eye. The skeleton is but partially known, but it has\r\nbeen ascertained that there were five toes in the manus and probably also\r\nin the pes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 203.—Skull of _†Protoreodon parvus_, Uinta Eocene.\r\nPrinceton University Museum. N.B. This skull is actually much smaller\r\nthan that shown in Fig. 202.]\r\n\r\nNothing has yet been discovered in formations older than the upper Eocene\r\nwhich can be regarded as ancestral to the †oreodonts, and this is not\r\nsurprising in view of the extremely meagre and unsatisfactory nature\r\nof our information regarding the artiodactyls of the Bridger. On the\r\nwhole, however, it seems rather more probable that the Uinta genus was an\r\nimmigrant (whence, we cannot say) than that the Bridger will ever yield\r\nthe desired ancestral forms. So long as the early Tertiary mammals of\r\nnorthern and central Asia remain unknown, this and many similar problems\r\ncan find no definitive solution. The question of relationship with other\r\nfamilies is bound up with that of the origin of the †oreodonts; many\r\ncharacters point to a connection with the †anthracotheres and, from the\r\nstandpoint of present knowledge, that appears to be the most probable\r\naffinity; but, on the other hand, there are structural features which\r\nsuggest relationship with the primitive camels. Between these and other\r\nalternatives, only the recovery of the middle and lower Eocene forms can\r\nfinally decide.\r\n\r\nReviewing the long history of the oreodont family from the evolutionary\r\npoint of view, we find a course of development which differs in several\r\nrespects from that exemplified by most of the families previously\r\nconsidered:\r\n\r\n(1) There was a general increase in size, though it was far from steady,\r\nand almost every genus had larger and smaller species, and in some of\r\nthe phyla the species were far larger than in others. The members of the\r\n_†Leptauchenia_ phylum were very small and no member of the family ever\r\nattained to more than moderate size.\r\n\r\n(2) The upper molars early lost the fifth cusp, and after that there\r\nwas little change in the dentition, except that in the _†Merychyus_ and\r\n_†Leptauchenia_ phyla the grinding teeth became hypsodont.\r\n\r\n(3) There was great variety in the modifications of the skull, each\r\nphylum having its own peculiarities. The orbit, which was open behind\r\nin the Uinta _†Protoreodon_, was closed in the White River and all\r\nsucceeding genera. In the _†Merycochœrus_ series, the skull first\r\nenlarged, with little change in proportions, then elongated the facial\r\nregion, then shortened the face and so reduced the nasals as to indicate\r\nthe presence of a proboscis, culminating in the grotesque, ape-like skull\r\nof _†Pronomotherium_. In the _†Leptauchenia_ phylum the skull became\r\ndepressed and flattened and the face was invaded by great openings, or\r\nvacuities; the tympanic bullæ were enormously inflated and the orbits\r\nand ear-openings raised, presumably in adaptation to an amphibious mode\r\nof life. These were the extremes of change within the family; the other\r\nphyla need not be considered.\r\n\r\n(4) At an early stage the digits were reduced from five to four, first\r\nin the pes and then in the manus, and there reduction ceased; though in\r\n_†Merychyus_, especially in the upper Miocene species, the lateral digits\r\nwere very slender and, had this series survived, it would probably have\r\nled to didactyl forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204.—Left manus of †oreodonts. _A_, _†Merycoidodon\r\nculbertsoni_, White River. _B_, _†Merycochœrus proprius_, upper Miocene.]\r\n\r\nIn other respects there was very little difference in the skeletons of\r\nthe various phyla and herein lies the peculiarity in the history of the\r\nfamily, great variety in the form of the skull, and, relatively speaking,\r\nhardly any change in the body, limbs or feet. In the horses, rhinoceroses\r\nand †titanotheres the modifications of the successive genera affected\r\nall parts of the structure, but in the †oreodonts, except for the loss\r\nof one digit in manus and pes and variations in the length of the tail,\r\nthe skeletons of the latest genera did not differ in any important\r\nrespect from those of the earliest. Such a combination of mutability and\r\nplasticity in the skull with extreme conservatism in the remainder of the\r\nbony structure is an exception to the usual mode of development, though\r\nsomething of the same sort has already been pointed out in the case of\r\nthe tapirs (p. 325) and will recur in that of the elephants (Chap. X).\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _†Agriochœridæ. †Agriochœrids_\r\n\r\nThis family, one of the strangest and most aberrant of ungulate groups,\r\nwas very closely allied to the †oreodonts and by many authorities is\r\nincluded in the same family. The history of the successive steps of\r\ndiscovery, by which the structure of these extraordinary animals was\r\ngradually made plain, is much the same as in the case of the even more\r\npeculiar perissodactyl family of the †chalicotheres (p. 356). The various\r\nparts, found scattered and at long intervals of time, had been referred\r\nto no less than three different mammalian _orders_! for, until the\r\ndiscovery of †chalicothere skeletons gave the clue, no one imagined that\r\nsuch discordant parts could belong to the same animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 205.—Skull of _†Agriochœrus latifrons_, White River.\r\n(After Wortman.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206.—_†Agriochœrus antiquus_, White River. Restored\r\nfrom a skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nThe †agriochœrids had a very much shorter career than the allied family\r\nof the †oreodonts, extending only through the upper Eocene and the\r\nOligocene (Uinta to John Day, inclusive); and only two genera of the\r\nfamily are yet known, _†Agriochœrus_ of the John Day and White River,\r\nand _†Protagriochœrus_ of the Uinta. In the former the teeth were not in\r\na continuous, closely crowded series, but there were open spaces behind\r\nthe upper canine and first lower premolar; the same exceptional character\r\nof the lower teeth which was found in the †oreodonts was repeated in\r\nthe present family, the canine assuming the form and functions of an\r\nincisor and the first premolar those of the canine; the upper incisors\r\nwere extremely small and were shed in the adult, just as in the true\r\nruminants. The molars had the selenodont pattern, but the upper molars\r\nwere very different in shape from those of the †oreodonts, resembling\r\nrather those of the †anthracothere _†Bothriodon_ (see p. 370). Another\r\ndifference from the †oreodont dentition was that the last lower premolar\r\nhad acquired the molar form and the last upper one nearly so, a very\r\nunusual feature among the artiodactyls. The skull was almost exactly like\r\nthat of the White River †oreodonts, save in a few details; the face was\r\nsomewhat longer, the orbit was open behind and there was no glandular pit\r\non the face in front of the eye. The neck was short and the body long,\r\nand the backbone in the region of the loins very stout, the vertebræ of\r\nthis region having much resemblance to those of the great cats, as though\r\n_†Agriochœrus_ were an agile and powerful leaper. Another likeness to\r\nthe cats was in the very long and heavy tail, which was much longer\r\nthan in the †oreodonts, and its vertebræ were hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom those of a Leopard. The limbs were relatively longer than those\r\nof the †oreodonts and the separate bones had a suggestive likeness to\r\nthose of carnivores, and, more specifically, of cats. The feet, save in\r\none particular, were not only artiodactyl, but also characteristically\r\n†oreodont in structure and, as in the earlier members of that family,\r\nthere were five toes in the manus and four in the pes. The exception\r\nwas that, instead of narrow and slender hoofs, the feet were armed with\r\nsharp, though not very large claws, which were not comparable in relative\r\nsize to the great claws of the †chalicotheres.\r\n\r\nAltogether, a strange jumble of incongruous characters was united in\r\nthis skeleton. Were only the skeleton known without the skull, one would\r\nbe tempted to call it that of a carnivorous artiodactyl, but the teeth\r\nmake such a suggestion absurd, since they could have been used only for\r\nmasticating a diet of soft vegetable substances. No flesh-eater has,\r\nor ever had, teeth in the remotest degree like these, which were of\r\ncharacteristically herbivorous type. How such a creature lived and what\r\nwere its habits, are questions to which no satisfactory answer has been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207.—Right manus of _†Agriochœrus latifrons_, White\r\nRiver. (After Wortman.)]\r\n\r\n_†Protagriochœrus_ of the upper Eocene is, unfortunately, known only from\r\nvery imperfect and fragmentary specimens, which, however, are sufficient\r\nto determine some significant points. These remains show that, while\r\nthe two families of the †agriochœrids and the †oreodonts were already\r\ndistinct in the Uinta, they were decidedly nearer together than they\r\nbecame in the Oligocene. In other words, it is clear that the two groups\r\nwere converging back to a common ancestry. This may be discovered in the\r\nBridger, but it seems more probable that these forms were immigrants.\r\nAnother fact concerning the Uinta genus, which is important, is that the\r\nupper molars possessed the fifth or unpaired cusp which also occurred in\r\nthe contemporary †oreodonts, as well as in the †anthracotheres and other\r\nOld World families.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER TYLOPODA. CAMELS AND CAMEL-LIKE ANIMALS\r\n\r\nExisting Tylopoda are all included in a single family, the Camelidæ,\r\nand by several authorities no other family, even of extinct forms, is\r\nadmitted to the suborder. My own preference, however, is to refer the\r\nproblematical little †hypertragulids to this group, as will be shown\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Camelidæ. Camels and Llamas_\r\n\r\nUnder modern conditions, no mammals could seem more completely foreign\r\nto North America than those of the camel family, which, now restricted\r\nto two well-defined genera, inhabit central Asia and the colder parts\r\nof South America. Yet, as a matter of fact, this family passed through\r\nnearly the whole of its development in North America and did not emigrate\r\nto the other continents before the late Miocene or early Pliocene, and it\r\nis this North American origin of the family which explains its otherwise\r\ninexplicable distribution at the present time. To all appearances, the\r\nwhole family had completely disappeared from this continent in the later\r\nPleistocene, but in the middle and earlier portions of that epoch both\r\ntrue camels and large llama-like animals were very abundant on the Great\r\nPlains and in California, while they seem to have avoided the forested\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the changes through which the camels and llamas\r\nhave passed, it will be necessary to consider briefly the skeletal and\r\ndental structure which characterizes the modern genera. In the true\r\ncamels (_Camelus_) the first and second upper incisors have been lost,\r\nbut the third remains as a large, sharp-pointed tooth, as are also the\r\nupper canine and first premolar; thus there are three pointed, spike-like\r\nteeth in a row, with spaces between them, constituting with the lower\r\ncanine a very effective lacerating apparatus. Behind the first premolar\r\nis a long gap, the second being suppressed; the third and fourth are\r\ngrinding teeth, but unusually small. The molars are selenodont and\r\nhigh-crowned, though not extremely hypsodont. The lower incisors are\r\nlarge and shovel-shaped, the canine large and erect and there are but two\r\nlower premolars. The dental formula thus is: _i_ 1/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 3/2,\r\n_m_ 3/3.\r\n\r\nThe skull is long, with the facial region much and abruptly narrowed,\r\nwhich gives a triangular appearance to the head when seen from above; the\r\norbit is completely encircled with bone and the sagittal and occipital\r\ncrests are very prominent. The tympanic bullæ are large and filled with\r\nspongy bone. The condyle of the lower jaw is hemispherical and not,\r\nas it is in most ungulates, semicylindrical, and a curious, hook-like\r\nangulation is on the posterior border of the bone. The neck is very long,\r\nand the vertebræ have the exceptional peculiarity that the canal for the\r\nvertebral artery runs through the side of the neural arch, instead of\r\nperforating the transverse process, and thus is invisible externally; the\r\nodontoid process of the axis is spout-like. The legs and feet are very\r\nlong; the humerus has a double bicipital groove and the fore-arm bones\r\nare coössified, and the ulna is so reduced that the radius carries the\r\nwhole weight; in the lower hind leg the tibia supports the weight, and\r\nof the fibula only the lower end remains as the malleolar bone. There\r\nare but two digits in each foot, the third and fourth, the metapodials\r\nof which have coalesced to form a cannon-bone, which differs from that\r\nof the true ruminants, or Pecora, in the curious way in which the lower\r\nends, separated by a Λ-shaped notch, diverge from each other, and by\r\nthe fact that the keels of the lower articular surfaces are confined\r\nto the posterior side, not visible from the front. The ungual phalanges\r\nare small and nodular, and the hoofs, which carry no part of the weight,\r\nare hardly more than nails. Under the other phalanges is a broad pad of\r\nelastic tissue, upon which the weight rests, and the separation of the\r\ntoes is very partial. The peculiar external appearance of the camels\r\nis largely due to structures which leave no trace in the skeleton, and\r\nespecially to the great humps, one or two according to the species, which\r\nare accumulations of fat; the ears are short and rounded and the hair is\r\nnot woolly, but almost straight.\r\n\r\nThe teeth and skeleton of the llamas (_Lama_) are closely similar\r\nto those of the camels, but the absence of humps, the long, pointed\r\nears, the woolly hair and the much smaller size and lighter build give\r\nto the living animals a more marked difference of appearance from\r\nthe camels than one would expect from a comparison of the skeletons\r\nalone. The dental formula is: _i_ 1/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 2/2, _m_ 3/3. The\r\nremaining upper incisor, the third, is recurved, as is also the canine,\r\nbut the spike-shaped first premolar of the camels is absent and the\r\nother premolars are much smaller than in the latter. In the skull the\r\nbrain-case is larger, and the sagittal and occipital crests are much less\r\nprominent. The skeleton differs hardly at all from that of the camels,\r\nexcept for its smaller size and more slender proportions. The toes are\r\nmore distinctly separated, each having its own pad. Thus, among the\r\nexisting representatives of the family are two very well-defined phyla,\r\neach characteristic of a different continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208.—Guanaco (_Lama huanacus_).—By permission of the\r\nNew York Zoölogical Society.]\r\n\r\nThe Blanco stage of the middle Pliocene, which has preserved but a meagre\r\nrepresentation of the life of its time, has yielded a number of very\r\nlarge, llama-like species, not, however, ancestral to the modern species,\r\nfor they had but one premolar in each jaw. From the lower Pliocene\r\nwe have fuller information. In the Snake Creek stage the separation\r\nof the two modern phyla was complete, and there was a third one, now\r\nextinct, that of the browsing or “†giraffe-camels” (_†Alticamelus_)\r\n(see Fig. 127, p. 236), a term which must not be taken as implying any\r\nrelationship with the giraffes, but merely a resemblance to them in\r\nproportions. These browsing camels were very large animals, but with\r\nrelatively small heads and low-crowned teeth not suited for grazing; the\r\nneck was extremely long, made so by the great elongation of five of the\r\nvertebræ (second to sixth, inclusive), and the legs were also very long,\r\nfitting their possessors to browse upon trees. Much of the description\r\nof the appearance and habits of the Giraffe given by Flower and Lydekker\r\nwould no doubt be applicable to these extinct camels. “To produce the\r\nextremely elongated neck the seven cervical vertebræ are proportionately\r\nlong, which gives a somewhat stiff and awkward motion to the neck....\r\nThe Giraffe feeds almost exclusively on the foliage of trees ... for\r\nbrowsing on which its prehensile tongue and large free lips are specially\r\nadapted.”[8]\r\n\r\nIn teeth and skeleton the phyla of the true camels and of the llamas in\r\nthe lower Pliocene did not differ very strongly from the living forms;\r\nthe upper incisors were already reduced to one, but the premolars were\r\nnot so small; the ulna and radius had coalesced and of the fibula only\r\nthe lower end remained; the cannon-bones were completely formed, and\r\nthat the pads of the feet had already been developed is shown by the\r\nphalanges, especially the irregular, nodular unguals.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient known camels of the Old World are found in the Pliocene\r\nof India, and the first llamas recorded in South America are also\r\nPliocene. Since both camels and llamas existed together in North America,\r\nit may reasonably be asked why only one phylum migrated to Asia and only\r\nthe other to South America. Why did not each continent receive migrants\r\nof both kinds? Without knowing more than we are ever likely to learn\r\nabout the details of these migrations, it will not be possible to answer\r\nthese questions, though plausible solutions of the problem suggest\r\nthemselves. It is to be noted, in the first place, that a migration\r\nfrom the central portion of North America to Asia was by way of the far\r\nnorth and thus involved very different climatic conditions from those\r\nwhich must have been encountered in passing through the tropics to South\r\nAmerica. It is perfectly possible that animals which lived together\r\nin temperate North America should have had very different powers of\r\nadaptation to heat and cold respectively, and the northern route may have\r\nbeen impassable to one and the southern route to the other. To this it\r\nmight perhaps be objected that the llamas are cold-country animals, but\r\nthis is true only of the existing species, for fossil forms are found\r\nabundantly in the Pleistocene of Ecuador, Brazil and Argentina. Another\r\npossibility is that both phyla did actually migrate to both continents\r\nand that only the camels succeeded in permanently establishing themselves\r\nin Asia and only the llamas in South America, though for this solution\r\nthe fossils afford no evidence.\r\n\r\nThe camels of the upper Miocene did not differ sufficiently from those\r\nof the lower Pliocene to call for special notice other than to remark\r\nthat the two phyla of the true camels and the llamas were hardly\r\ndistinguishable and one genus (_†Procamelus_) may have been ancestral\r\nto both. In the middle Miocene the browsing camels (_†Alticamelus_)\r\nreached the acme of their importance and made no great progress\r\nsubsequently. The generalized stock, from which the upper Miocene and\r\nlower Pliocene _†Procamelus_ descended, was represented by _†Protolabis_\r\nand _†Miolabis_, smaller animals, which had a full set of upper incisors\r\nand premolars and the grinding teeth were not so high-crowned. In most\r\nof the species the metapodials had not fused to form cannon-bones and\r\nprobably there were no pads on the feet, though _†Alticamelus_, the\r\n†Giraffe-Camel, had already developed both cannon-bones and pads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209.—Lower Miocene †giraffe-camel (_†Oxydactylus\r\nlongipes_). Restored from a skeleton in the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh.]\r\n\r\nIn the lower Miocene the †giraffe-camels were represented by the genus\r\n_†Oxydactylus_, which was a considerably smaller animal than its\r\nsuccessor _†Alticamelus_, of the middle Miocene and later formations,\r\nand had shorter neck and legs. The teeth, though brachyodont, were not\r\nvery low-crowned. There was no cannon-bone, the two metapodials of each\r\nfoot remaining separate. An especially noteworthy feature in this genus\r\nis to be observed in the character of the hoofs, which, as the ungual\r\nphalanges demonstrate, were narrow and pointed, like those of antelope\r\nand deer, and carried most of the weight. The member of the grazing\r\nseries (_†Protomeryx_) was smaller in every way than its contemporary\r\n(_†Oxydactylus_) of the browsing line and had shorter neck and legs,\r\nthough these were already long. The teeth were present in undiminished\r\nnumber, and the grinders, while not properly to be called hypsodont,\r\nshowed a decided tendency to assume that character. The feet were in the\r\nsame stage of development as in _†Oxydactylus_, that is to say, with two\r\nfree digits and pointed, deer-like hoofs. We have thus the remarkable\r\nand most significant fact that, while the grazing and browsing camels\r\nof the lower Miocene were already distinctly separated, neither had yet\r\nattained to the type of foot-structure which _both_ of them afterwards\r\nindependently acquired. This is a very instructive example of parallel\r\nevolution in closely related series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210.—Skeleton of _†Oxydactylus longipes_. Lower\r\nMiocene. (After Peterson.) For restoration, see Fig. 209.]\r\n\r\nOf still another phylum of the camel family, the lower Miocene contains\r\nthe only representatives yet discovered, the little “†gazelle-camels,”\r\nas they may be called. The single known genus (_†Stenomylus_, Fig. 131,\r\np. 242) of this series was quite a small animal, much smaller than its\r\ncontemporaries of the grazing or browsing series. _†Stenomylus_ was an\r\nextremely slender, cursorial creature and had a very exceptional feature\r\nin its dentition in the apparent presence of ten lower incisors, five\r\non each side, the canine and first premolar having assumed the form and\r\nfunctions of the incisors; the molars were low-crowned. The head was\r\nrather small and rounded, the neck long and light, the limbs and feet\r\nelongate and excessively slender. The feet had two digits each, which\r\nwere separate, not forming a cannon-bone, and the hoofs were narrow,\r\npointed and deer-like. These delicate and graceful little animals had\r\nbut a brief career, which seems to have reached its close in the lower\r\nMiocene. Perhaps their complete defencelessness made it impossible for\r\nthem to maintain themselves against their enemies, despite their evident\r\ncapacity for swift running.\r\n\r\nThe camels of the upper Oligocene (John Day) are still incompletely\r\nknown, but appear all to have belonged to the series of grazers which led\r\nup to the modern genera. Future discovery may bring to light in the John\r\nDay earlier members of the †giraffe-camel series, of which a possible\r\nmember is found in the uppermost substage of the White River, or perhaps\r\nboth phyla united in the upper Oligocene, a question which remains to be\r\ndetermined. At all events, in the middle substage of the White River,\r\nor lower Oligocene, there is no evidence of more than a single phylum,\r\nfrom which the others were almost certainly derived, branching off from\r\nthe main stem at different levels. First was given off the branch of\r\nthe †giraffe-camels, then (or perhaps even earlier) that of the little\r\n†gazelle-camels, and, finally, the main stem bifurcated into the two\r\nphyla of the llamas and the true camels. The point of origin of the\r\n†gazelle-camels is still uncertain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 211.—The White River camel (_†Poëbrotherium\r\nlabiatum_). Restored from a skeleton in the museum of Princeton\r\nUniversity.]\r\n\r\nThe typical White River genus (_†Poëbrotherium_) included a series of\r\nspecies which increased in size from the earlier to the later portions\r\nof the stage, but showed no such structural changes as to call for\r\nspecial notice. The larger of these species was somewhat taller than\r\na sheep, but of much lighter proportions, with small, pointed head,\r\nlong neck and body and long, very slender limbs and feet. The teeth\r\nwere present in undiminished number, 44 in all; the lower incisors\r\nwere small, simple, nearly erect and chisel-shaped, very different\r\nfrom the large, procumbent and shovel-like teeth of the modern genera,\r\nand the trenchant canines were much smaller than in the latter. The\r\nfirst premolar had an isolated position, the second and third were\r\ntrenchant and much extended antero-posteriorly, quite as in many other\r\ngroups of primitive artiodactyls. The molars, which were typically\r\nselenodont, were low-crowned in the upper jaw, but in the lower showed\r\nan incipient tendency to hypsodontism. The skull, by its shape and the\r\ncharacteristic narrowing of the face, immediately suggests the modern\r\ntype, but differed in many details of structure, the most obvious of\r\nwhich were the incompletely closed orbits, the shallow and slender\r\njaws, and the very large, hook-like process from the angle of the\r\nlower jaw, which, in greatly reduced form, is present in both of the\r\nRecent genera. The neck was relatively long, though by no means so long\r\nproportionately as it subsequently became, and the vertebræ had already\r\nacquired the peculiarity found in all the succeeding camels, of the\r\nexceptional position of the canal for the vertebral artery, save in the\r\nsixth vertebra, where it pierced the transverse process, as in mammals\r\ngenerally; the odontoid process of the axis was neither spout-like nor\r\npeg-like, but of intermediate form, convex below and flat above. The\r\nbody was long and light, and the ribs were much more slender than in\r\nthe Recent genera. The fore and hind limbs, which were of nearly equal\r\nlength, were very slender; the humerus had a single bicipital groove;\r\nthe fore-arm bones were fully coössified and in the lower leg only the\r\ntwo ends of the fibula remained. The feet were already in the stage of\r\ndevelopment which persisted through the lower Miocene in all of the\r\nphyla, with two separate digits and nodular remnants of two others, and\r\ndeer-like hoofs.\r\n\r\nIt would be of interest to compare this little White River camel with\r\nits contemporary genus of horses, _†Mesohippus_, and to observe in\r\nhow many respects they have followed a parallel course, and how nearly\r\n_†Poëbrotherium_ occupied the same position with reference to the modern\r\ncamels and llamas as _†Mesohippus_ did to the Recent horses; but such\r\na comparison would involve too many technicalities to be profitably\r\nundertaken here. Suffice it to say that in many details there was a\r\ngenuine parallelism in the progress of these two widely separated\r\nfamilies from a polydactyl ancestry towards an extreme of digital\r\nreduction, ending in the horses in the single-toed and in the camels in\r\nthe two-toed foot. The members of the two series kept nearly equal pace\r\nin their slow progress, with the camels a little in advance, since they\r\nwere the first to attain the modern state of development in the height\r\nof the teeth and the structure of the feet, though eventually the horses\r\nsurpassed them in both respects.\r\n\r\nIn the upper Eocene (Uinta stage) there were at least two kinds of\r\ncamels, the time-relations of which to each other are not known, that\r\nis, whether they were contemporary or successive. The best-known genus,\r\n_†Protylopus_, may perhaps not be in the direct line of camel descent,\r\nbut it so nearly represents the proper ancestral stage that, for all\r\npractical purposes, it will serve nearly as well. It was a much smaller\r\nanimal than the smallest of the White River species, and was hardly\r\nlarger than a “jack-rabbit.” The teeth of each jaw were in continuous\r\nseries and the canines were but slightly longer than the incisors; the\r\npremolars had less antero-posterior extension than in _†Poëbrotherium_,\r\nand all the molars above and below were very low-crowned. The skull was\r\nalmost a miniature copy of that of _†Poëbrotherium_, but more primitive\r\nin a number of details, the most important of which was that the tympanic\r\nbullæ were much smaller and hollow, not filled with spongy bone. The\r\nneck, concerning which it would be very desirable to have information, is\r\nalmost the only part of the skeleton that is not known. The fore limb was\r\nconsiderably shorter than the hind, making the back slope downward from\r\nthe rump to the shoulders; in the fore-arm the two bones were entirely\r\nseparate and in the lower leg the fibula, though very slender, was still\r\ncomplete. In the manus there were four functional digits, the laterals\r\nnot very much smaller than the median pair; but in the pes the lateral\r\nmetatarsals were reduced to mere bony threads, to which small phalanges,\r\nin full complement, were attached, making tiny dew-claws.\r\n\r\nWith _†Protylopus_ ends the genealogy of the camels so far as it can be\r\ndefinitively traced, but in the middle of the Bridger stage is found a\r\ngenus, _†Homacodon_ (family †Dichobunidæ), which is a probable member of\r\nthe series. However, until the connecting link can be found in the upper\r\nBridger, this conclusion cannot be demonstrated and _†Homacodon_ itself\r\nis incompletely known. It was a very small animal, even less in size than\r\n_†Protylopus_, and had not yet acquired the selenodont molars. These\r\nteeth were quadritubercular, _i.e._ with four principal cusps arranged,\r\nin the upper molars, in a square, and with a minute cuspule between each\r\ntransverse pair, while the lower molars were narrower and had only the\r\nfour principal cusps. The cusps were not conical, as they are in the\r\npigs, but angular and pyramidal, the first step toward the assumption\r\nof the selenodont form. The skull was not specifically cameline in\r\nappearance, but rather indifferent, as though almost any kind of an\r\nartiodactyl might have been derived from it. The feet were decidedly more\r\nprimitive than those of the Uinta genus, having four functional digits\r\neach, perhaps five in the manus. While it cannot be positively stated\r\nthat _†Homacodon_ was the actual ancestor of _†Protylopus_, it nearly\r\nrepresents what we should expect that ancestor to be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 212.—Diagram to illustrate the development of\r\nthe skull and molar teeth in the camel tribe, in ascending geological\r\norder. _A_, _†Protylopus petersoni_, Uinta Eocene. _B_, _†Poëbrotherium\r\nwilsoni_, White River. (After Wortman.) _C_, _†Procamelus gracilis_,\r\nupper Miocene. (After Cope.) _D_, _Lama huanacus_, the modern Guanaco.]\r\n\r\nIn the lower Eocene (Wasatch stage) lived a tiny creature,\r\n_†Trigonolestes_ (family †Trigonolestidæ), smaller even than _†Homacodon_\r\nof the Bridger, and one of the most ancient and primitive of known\r\nartiodactyls, but, unfortunately, still represented only by very\r\nimperfect specimens, so that much which it would be highly desirable to\r\nlearn must await the finding of better material. The upper molars were\r\ntriangular and tritubercular, _i.e._ with three principal cusps arranged\r\nin a triangle, and are hardly to be distinguished from those of other\r\nearly mammalian orders. From the teeth alone the artiodactyl nature of\r\nthe animal would not have been suspected, and, in fact, they were, when\r\nfirst discovered, referred to primitive monkeys. The feet probably had\r\nfive toes each, but this is not certain, and the femur had the third\r\ntrochanter, the only known artiodactyl of which this is true. As this\r\nlittle Wasatch genus is so imperfectly known, it would be premature to\r\nclaim it as the starting point of the camel family, and yet it may very\r\nwell have been so. Better material of this genus and the links of the\r\nchain which belong in the upper Bridger and the Wind River respectively\r\nmust be recovered before this earliest portion of the family history can\r\nbe written in more than tentative fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213.—Right manus of camels. _A_, _†Protylopus_,\r\nUinta. _B_, _†Poëbrotherium_, White River. _C_, _†Procamelus_, upper\r\nMiocene.

(After Cope.) _D_, Guanaco.]\r\n\r\nThe mode of evolution displayed by the camels does not differ in any\r\nsignificant respect from that seen in the horses. There was the same\r\nincrease in bodily stature and in the relative lengths of the limbs\r\nand feet, the same kind of diminution in the number of digits from\r\nthe original five, the same reduction of the ulna and its coalescence\r\nwith the radius and the loss of the fibula save for its two ends. There\r\nwas also a similar development of the high-crowned, or hypsodont,\r\ngrinding teeth, from the low-crowned, or brachyodont, type. In still\r\nanother respect there was a similarity in the mode of development of\r\nthe two families, namely, in the way in which the several phyla of\r\neach originated. For the earlier portion of their history there was in\r\neach but a single distinguishable series, though it is very possible\r\nthat fuller knowledge and more complete material would enable us to\r\ndistinguish more than one. This monophyletic condition continued through\r\nthe Eocene and most of the Oligocene, but in the upper portion of the\r\nlatter and, more markedly in the lower Miocene, the two families branched\r\nout, each in its own fashion.\r\n\r\nOf course, there were differences in the development of the camels\r\nand horses, some conditioned by the fundamental distinction between\r\nartiodactyl and perissodactyl, such as the didactyl foot as the\r\npossible minimum and the formation of cannon-bones in the camels. Other\r\ndifferences are characteristic of the latter family, such as the great\r\nelongation of the neck and the peculiar structure of its vertebræ, the\r\nformation of pads on the feet and concomitant reduction of the hoofs. In\r\na general way, the two families kept quite an even pace in their advance\r\nfrom the more primitive to the more specialized condition and, though\r\nthe camels were the first to acquire certain modifications, the horses\r\nultimately surpassed them.\r\n\r\nEven more close was the parallelism in evolution between the camels and\r\nthe true ruminants (suborder Pecora), and this case is of particular\r\nimportance as clearly demonstrating the development, in two independent\r\nbut related lines, of similar structures not derived from a common\r\nancestry. This comparison must naturally await the description of the\r\nPecora.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _†Hypertragulidæ. †Hypertragulids_\r\n\r\nThis was a very peculiar family, of exclusively North American\r\ndistribution and of doubtful systematic position, the known history of\r\nwhich extended from the upper Eocene into the lowest Miocene and then\r\nabruptly terminated. None of its members attained to considerable size,\r\nthe largest hardly surpassing a sheep, and some were extremely small.\r\nIn view of its comparatively brief career, this family was surprisingly\r\nramified, and no less than four phyla may be distinguished within its\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215.—_†Syndyoceras cooki_, lower Miocene. Restored\r\nfrom a skeleton in the museum of the University of Nebraska.]\r\n\r\nOne of the phyla which persisted into the lower Miocene was there\r\nrepresented by a most fantastic creature (_†Syndyoceras_) with four\r\nhorn-like outgrowths from the skull, one pair arising from the anterior\r\npart of the face and curving outward away from each other, and the hinder\r\npair, which were placed over the eyes, curved toward each other at the\r\ntips and were shaped much like a cow’s horns in miniature. The shape of\r\nthese bony protuberances makes it unlikely that they were sheathed in\r\nhorn and probably they were merely covered with skin like the horns of\r\nthe giraffes. This description applies only to the skull of the male;\r\nthat of the female is not yet known, but there is good reason to believe\r\nthat in that sex the horns were much smaller or wanting, as in nearly\r\nall existing deer. The skull was long, narrow and low; the orbits were\r\nsmall, completely enclosed in bone and unusually prominent; the nasal\r\nbones were exceedingly short, as though indicating the existence of a\r\nproboscis, but this can hardly have been the case, for the nasal opening\r\nwas divided into anterior and posterior portions by the bony bridge which\r\nunited the bases of the forward pair of horns. In no other known mammal\r\ndoes such a division of the nasal opening occur. The upper incisors had\r\nall disappeared, but there was a small upper canine tusk and another\r\nformed by the first lower premolar, while the real lower canine had gone\r\nover to the incisor series. This exceptional arrangement is a point of\r\nresemblance to the †oreodonts (see p. 372). The grinding teeth were\r\nbrachyodont. The fore limb is not known, but the hind limb has been\r\ncompletely recovered; it was stout and not very long in proportion to\r\nthe length of the head. The fibula was completely reduced, only the ends\r\nremaining, and the pes was didactyl, the two metatarsals uniting in a\r\ncannon-bone; the hoofs were like those of deer and antelopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216.—_†Protoceras celer_, upper White River; males\r\non the right and left, female in the middle. Restored from skeletons in\r\nthe American Museum and Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nNo representative of this series has yet been found in the upper\r\nOligocene; and it is not yet possible to say whether their absence\r\nfrom the John Day beds, as in several other cases already referred to,\r\nwas due to an actual geographical difference in contemporary faunas,\r\nor whether it is merely one of the accidents of preservation and\r\ncollecting. In the upper White River, however, was another most curious\r\nanimal (_†Protoceras_), a forerunner, if not a direct ancestor, of\r\n_†Syndyoceras_. The exact relationship between the two forms can hardly\r\nbe determined, until the genera, one or more, which once connected them\r\nshall have been recovered, though it is obvious that they belonged to the\r\nsame series. _†Protoceras_ was a smaller animal and, if anything, an even\r\nmore bizarre-looking object, for the anterior protuberances were broad,\r\nprominent and everted plates of bone, not even suggesting horns in their\r\nform, and the posterior pair were short and club-shaped; in the female\r\nneither pair was more than indicated. The dentition was very similar\r\nto that of _†Syndyoceras_, except that the upper tusk was considerably\r\nlarger and scimitar-shaped; the female had no tusks. In the fore-arm\r\nthe two bones were just beginning to coalesce, but in the lower leg the\r\nfibula was completely reduced. The manus had four complete and functional\r\ndigits, the laterals not very much shorter and thinner than the median\r\npair; but the pes was already didactyl, though the metatarsals were\r\nseparate, not fused into a cannon-bone; two long and pointed splints\r\nwere the vestigial remnants of the second and fifth digits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 217.—_†Protoceras celer_, skull of male. (After\r\nOsborn and Wortman.)]\r\n\r\nIt is not yet possible to trace this phylum below the level of the\r\nuppermost White River beds, yet that will very probably be accomplished\r\nby future exploration.\r\n\r\nThe second phylum of the family was represented in the lowest Miocene\r\nby _†Hypertragulus_, a genus of much smaller animals than those of the\r\npreceding series, which went back to White River times without essential\r\nchange, and was abundant in the John Day stage. Despite this fact, the\r\nstructure of the genus is still incompletely known and much remains\r\nto be learned, but enough has already been ascertained to justify\r\nthe association of this phylum with the _†Protoceras-†Syndyoceras_\r\nseries in one family as reasonable. The number of upper incisors in\r\n_†Hypertragulus_ has not been ascertained, but the canines were enlarged\r\nand tusk-like, the lower one not having gone over to the incisors, as it\r\nhad in the preceding group. The skull had much resemblance to that of the\r\ncontemporary camels, the sudden narrowing of the facial region giving it\r\na very llama-like appearance; the orbit was open and on the face in front\r\nof it was a conspicuous vacuity. The ulna and radius were coössified and\r\nthere were four digits in the manus, two in the pes, but no cannon-bone\r\nwas formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 218.—Skull of _†Leptomeryx evansi_, White River.\r\n(After Matthew.)]\r\n\r\nThe third phylum, that of _†Leptomeryx_, had about the same range in\r\ntime as the preceding one, though it has not yet been found in the\r\nJohn Day, and the genus is assuredly known only from the White River\r\nbeds, in which it is not uncommon. _†Leptomeryx_ comprised a number of\r\nspecies, all very small animals, and none larger than a jack-rabbit. (See\r\nFig. 277, p. 563.) In size, proportions and appearance, these dainty\r\nlittle creatures must have been very like the existing chevrotains or\r\n“mouse-deer” of Asia and the Malay islands, and by many writers they have\r\nbeen classed in the same suborder, the Tragulina. The upper incisors had\r\nbeen suppressed and the upper canine reduced to very small size, while\r\nthe lower canine had become functionally one of the incisors. The skull\r\nhad a very long and slender facial region, but had a less llama-like\r\nappearance than in _†Hypertragulus_. The neck was short and the fore\r\nlimbs much shorter than the hind, so that the back sloped downward from\r\nthe rump to the shoulders, as in the chevrotains. There was a remarkable,\r\nindeed quite unparalleled, difference between the fore and hind limbs and\r\nfeet, the hinder extremity being not only much longer, but also much more\r\nspecialized, while the anterior one retained in very large degree its\r\nprimitive characteristics. Thus, in the fore-arm the ulna was complete\r\nand separate from the radius, but in the lower leg the fibula was reduced\r\nto its minimum. In the manus there were four entire and functional\r\ndigits, in the pes only two, which were joined in a cannon-bone.\r\n\r\nFinally, there was a fourth phylum, that of _†Hypisodus_, which was\r\nconfined to the White River stage and is still incompletely known. This\r\nwas a tiny creature, much smaller than any of the preceding ones, and\r\nis the only known White River ungulate with fully hypsodont grinding\r\nteeth. Another very exceptional peculiarity of its dentition was that in\r\nthe lower jaw it had ten incisor-like teeth; not only the canine, but\r\nthe first premolar as well, had assumed the character of the incisors.\r\nThis same peculiarity is found in the lower Miocene †gazelle-camel,\r\n_†Stenomylus_ (see p. 394), but in no other mammal.\r\n\r\nA considerable assemblage of genera belonging to this family occurs in\r\nthe upper Eocene, but the material yet obtained is too fragmentary to\r\npermit the assignment of these forms to the different phyla, though it is\r\nvery probable that among them are to be found ancestors of all the White\r\nRiver and subsequent genera.\r\n\r\nWhile there is little difference of opinion as to the propriety of\r\nincluding in the family †Hypertragulidæ the four phyla described in the\r\nforegoing pages, the systematic position and the relationships of that\r\nfamily as a whole are matters of debate and likely long to remain so. Dr.\r\nMatthew refers the entire group to the suborder Tragulina and regards\r\n_†Leptomeryx_ as being closely related to the direct ancestry of the\r\nAmerican deer, a view which is accepted by Professor Osborn, but in which\r\nI am unable to concur. My own belief is that the family was an early\r\noffshoot from the cameline stock and therefore referable to the Tylopoda,\r\nin which suborder they are here included. It would be out of place to\r\nenter upon a discussion of this perplexing problem, which can hardly\r\nreceive a definitive solution until the artiodactyls of the Uinta stage\r\nare thoroughly understood. As in so many other series, the key of the\r\nmystery lies hidden in the Uinta fauna, which is still so inadequately\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER PECORA. TRUE RUMINANTS\r\n\r\nThis is the most advanced, specialized and diversified group of the\r\nartiodactyls, though the ruminating habit is shared by both Tylopoda and\r\nTragulina. In this multitude of forms, giraffes, deer, antelopes, sheep,\r\ngoats, oxen, buffaloes, bisons, etc., it is difficult to find a clue to\r\na natural arrangement or classification. As a whole, the suborder is a\r\nwell-defined group, and many structural characters, not all of which\r\nis it needful to enumerate here, are common to all of its members. The\r\nupper incisors are invariably absent, and, save in a few of the deer,\r\nthe upper canine also, while the lower canine has become incisiform; the\r\npremolars are always three in number in each jaw and the molar-pattern is\r\nselenodont throughout. The odontoid process of the axis is spout-shaped.\r\nExcept in a few deer, the Pecora all have bony outgrowths of the skull\r\nin the form of antlers or horns, at least in the males, many females\r\nbeing hornless. The ulna is coössified with the radius and the fibula\r\nis lost, except the lower end, which is a separate malleolar bone. There\r\nis always, in both fore and hind feet, a cannon-bone, the lower ends of\r\nwhich are parallel, not divergent, as they are in the Tylopoda, and each\r\narticular surface is encircled all around by a prominent median keel, as\r\nin the horses, which in the other suborders, as in mammals generally, is\r\nconfined to the posterior side and not visible from the front. (_Cf._\r\nFigs. 220 and 214, p. 401.) In no existing member of the Pecora are there\r\ncomplete lateral digits, and in several modern genera they have been\r\ncompletely suppressed; but in most there is, behind the functional pair\r\nof digits, a pair of “dew-claws,” the bones of which are more or less\r\ncompletely reduced, often to mere nodules. The stomach, which in the\r\nTylopoda and Tragulina is three-chambered, is in the Pecora divided into\r\nfour distinct parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 219.—Left manus of Patagonian Deer (_Hippocamelus\r\nbisulcus_). _S._, scaphoid. _L._, lunar. _Py._, pyramidal. _Td._,\r\n_M._, coössified trapezoid and magnum. _Un._, unciform. _Mc.

Other letters as in Fig. 219.]\r\n\r\nAs already intimated, the subdivision of the Pecora into smaller groups\r\nis far from easy. “The great difficulty which all zoölogists have felt\r\nin subdividing them into natural minor groups arises from the fact that\r\nthe changes in different organs (feet, skull, frontal appendages, teeth,\r\ncutaneous glands, etc.) have proceeded with such apparent irregularity\r\nand absence of correlation that the different modifications of these\r\nparts are most variously combined in different members of the group.”[9]\r\nTwo main sections of the suborder are, however, sufficiently well\r\ndefined, (1) the Cervicornia and (2) the Cavicornia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION CERVICORNIA. DEER AND GIRAFFES\r\n\r\nThis section includes two families, the giraffes and the deer. Inasmuch\r\nas the former have not now and never did have any representatives in the\r\nwestern hemisphere, for the purposes of this book the section becomes\r\nidentical with the deer family.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Cervidæ. Deer_\r\n\r\nIn most of the deer now existing the male has antlers. The antler is\r\na bony outgrowth from the frontal bone of the skull and is annually\r\nshed and replaced, increasing, as a rule, in size and in the number of\r\nbranches with each renewal. During the period of growth the antler is\r\nrichly supplied with blood-vessels and covered with skin and is then said\r\nto be “in the velvet,” which dries and peels off when growth is complete;\r\nafter the rutting season a layer of bone at the base of the antler is\r\nresorbed, loosening the antler, which is then shed. There is, however,\r\na permanent, cylindrical process, of greater or less length, from each\r\nfrontal, the “_pedicle_,” from which the antler is annually reproduced,\r\nand around the base of the antler and shed with it is a roughened ring,\r\nthe “_burr_.” Among the different genera of deer there is great variety\r\nin the form and size of the antler, from a single spike to the immense\r\nand complicated appendages of the Wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_). As a\r\nrule, the “_beam_” or main stem of the antler and its branches or\r\n“_tines_” are cylindrical and tapering; but in some cases, as in the\r\nMoose (_Alce_) and the Fallow Deer (_Dama_), the antler is very broad\r\nand flat and is then said to be “_palmated_.” Except in the Reindeer and\r\nCaribou (_Rangifer_) the female is without antlers.\r\n\r\nIn the skeleton there is little difference between the deer and the\r\nCavicornia, but there are some differences in the teeth. In the males\r\nof those deer which have no antlers, such as the Musk-Deer (_Moschus\r\nmoschiferus_) and the Chinese Water-Deer (_Hydropotes inermis_), as well\r\nas in certain forms with very small antlers, like the muntjacs of Asia\r\n(_Cervulus_ and _Elaphodus_), the upper canine is a long, thin, recurved\r\nand sabre-like tusk, a very effective weapon. Speaking of the Indian\r\nMuntjac or “Barking Deer” (_Cervulus muntjac_), Flower and Lydekker\r\nsay, “When attacked by dogs the males use their sharp canine teeth with\r\ngreat vigour, inflicting upon their opponents deep and even dangerous\r\nwounds.” In other forms of deer the upper canines are small or absent.\r\nThe grinding teeth are brachyodont, but in the existing genera they have\r\nhigher crowns than in the Tertiary progenitors of the family, and in the\r\nAxis and Hog Deer of India (_Axis axis_ and _A. porcinus_) the molars are\r\nquite hypsodont.\r\n\r\nAs was shown in Chapter V, the existing deer of North America are of\r\ntwo kinds: (1) the northern, which are plainly of Old World origin and\r\nso closely similar to Old World species that many naturalists deny\r\nthe necessity of making distinct species for the American forms. The\r\nbest known of these are the Wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_), the Caribou\r\n(_Rangifer caribou_) and the Moose (_Alce americanus_). (2) The southern\r\ndeer, of which the common Virginia Deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_)\r\nis a familiar example, though overlapping in their range that of the\r\nnorthern genera, are peculiar to the Americas, and, though not exactly\r\nautochthonous, they must have had a long American ancestry. In the\r\nPleistocene we find the same genera and mostly the same species, their\r\ndistribution over the continent shifting in accordance with the many\r\nclimatic changes of that epoch. There was, however, at least one\r\nPleistocene genus (_†Cervalces_) different from any now living and\r\ndifferent from any known in the eastern hemisphere. The most complete\r\nspecimen of this animal is a skeleton in the museum of Princeton\r\nUniversity, found beneath a bog in northern New Jersey, though other\r\nbones, collected in Kentucky and elsewhere, are very probably referable\r\nto it. _†Cervalces_ was very nearly related to the Moose, the neck, body,\r\nlimbs and feet being almost identical in the two genera, but the skull\r\nand antlers were notably different; the nasal bones were not nearly so\r\nmuch shortened as in the Moose, indicating that the proboscis-like snout\r\nwas not so large or inflated as in the latter. The antlers were quite\r\nunique; though in general like those of the Moose, they were much less\r\npalmated and they had, in addition, a great trumpet-like plate of bone on\r\nthe lower side of each antler (see Fig. 117, p. 209), such as occurs in\r\nno other known member of the family. Although _†Cervalces_ has not been\r\nfound in the Old World, it was almost certainly an immigrant from eastern\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nThe Moose, Caribou and Wapiti were unquestionably immigrants and came in\r\nnot earlier than the Pleistocene. Nothing is known in the Pliocene or\r\nmore ancient Tertiary epochs of North America which could be twisted into\r\nforms ancestral to these typically Old World genera. With the southern\r\ndeer (_Odocoileus_, etc.) the matter stands differently, for these have\r\na probable American ancestry extending back to the lower Miocene and\r\npossibly much farther. On the other hand, it is not altogether certain\r\nthat these may not have been Pliocene immigrants, for their genealogy\r\nis still in an extremely fragmentary and unsatisfactory condition. The\r\nNorth American genus, _Odocoileus_, extended back to the Pliocene with\r\nvery little change. The annoying, unrecorded gap of the upper Pliocene\r\nand the meagre representation of the middle Pliocene mammals given by the\r\nBlanco leave us without information regarding the deer of that time. In\r\nthe lower Pliocene and through the whole Miocene we meet with frequent\r\nremains of a genus (_†Blastomeryx_) which was quite probably the ancestor\r\nof the American types of deer. It was considerably smaller than any of\r\nthe existing North American species and had no antlers, but possessed\r\nthe sabre-like, upper canine tusks, which characterize the muntjacs\r\nand hornless deer of Asia. The limb-bones had already attained nearly\r\ntheir present state of development, as regards the reduction of ulna and\r\nradius, formation of cannon-bones, etc. _†Blastomeryx_ probably entered\r\nNorth America in the lower Miocene, but, as was mentioned previously (p.\r\n409), Dr. Matthew and Professor Osborn regard the genus as autochthonous\r\nand descended from the †Hypertragulidæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 221.—Lower Miocene †hornless deer (_†Blastomeryx\r\nadvena_). Restored from a skeleton in the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle Miocene _†Blastomeryx_ gave rise to an aberrant genus\r\n(_†Merycodus_) which has been made the type of a distinct family\r\n(†Merycodontidæ, see table, p. 362), but this is perhaps unnecessary.\r\n_†Merycodus_ had deer-like antlers, but completely hypsodont teeth such\r\nas no known member of the Cervidæ possesses. The middle Miocene species\r\n(_†M. osborni_) was a little creature, not more than eighteen or twenty\r\ninches high at the shoulder, and had a branched antler of three tines,\r\nwhich was considerably longer than the skull, while in the species of the\r\nupper Miocene (_†M. furcatus_) the antler was shorter and simply forked.\r\nFrom the number of specimens of these animals found in which the burr is\r\nincomplete or absent, it may be inferred that the antler was not always\r\ndeciduous. The legs were long and very slender, and apparently there was\r\nno trace of the lateral digits, even in the fore foot. These peculiar\r\nhypsodont deer persisted even in the older Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 222.—Miocene †deer-antelopes (_†Merycodus osborni_,\r\nmiddle Miocene, and _†M. furcatus_, upper Miocene). Restored from\r\nspecimens in the American Museum.]\r\n\r\nDeer are the only members of the Pecora which inhabit South America,\r\nwhere there are several genera of them, all much more nearly allied to\r\nNorth American than to Old World forms. No record of the presence of the\r\nfamily in the southern continent has been found in beds older than the\r\nPleistocene, but in view of the degree of specialization which they have\r\nthere undergone, it is probable that the immigration took place in the\r\nPliocene.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION CAVICORNIA. HOLLOW-HORNED RUMINANTS\r\n\r\nIn the animals of this second and far larger section of the Pecora there\r\nare bony outgrowths of the skull, from the frontal bones, outgrowths\r\nwhich are permanent and non-deciduous; these are the _horn-cores_, which\r\nare tapering and unbranched. The horn-core is, in turn, covered with a\r\nsheath of horn, likewise unbranched and permanent, but growing from year\r\nto year until the maximum size is attained, a process which is familiarly\r\nillustrated in the growth of a calf. Among Recent Cavicornia there is\r\nbut one exception to the rule that the horny sheath is non-deciduous and\r\nunbranched and that one is the Prong Buck (_Antilocapra americana_). In\r\nthe Cavicornia it is the very general rule that both sexes are horned,\r\nthough the females commonly have smaller horns and in several genera\r\nof antelopes the does are hornless. There is almost as great variety\r\nin the shape and size of the horn as of the antler; we find small,\r\nmedium-sized and enormously large horns, which may be straight, simply\r\ncurved, complexly curved, spiral, lyrate or twisted. The antelopes have\r\nmany types of horns, as have the sheep and goats, the oxen, buffaloes and\r\nbisons; but only a few of them are exemplified in the western hemisphere,\r\nwhich now, as in the preceding geological periods, is singularly poor in\r\nrepresentatives of the Pecora.\r\n\r\n\r\n9, 10. _Antilopidæ and Antilocapridæ. Antelopes_\r\n\r\nTwo very different kinds of antelopes are found in North America at\r\nthe present time; one of them, the erroneously named Rocky Mountain\r\nGoat (_Oreamnos montanus_), is evidently a late immigrant from the Old\r\nWorld, and fossil remains of it have been found in the Pleistocene\r\ncave-deposits of California. This animal is a member of the true\r\nantelope family (Antilopidæ) and belongs to the chamois group of\r\nmountain-antelopes; it has no near relatives among other American\r\nmammals, living or extinct.\r\n\r\nThe Prong Buck, or Prong-horned Antelope (_Antilocapra americana_),\r\noccupies a very isolated position, so much so that a distinct family,\r\nthe Antilocapridæ, has been created for its reception. It differs from\r\nall other Cavicornia in having a branched horn, though the bony core\r\nis simple, and in annually shedding and renewing the horny sheath; the\r\nhorn is directly over the eye; there are no dew-claws and all traces\r\nof the bones of the lateral digits have completely disappeared. The\r\ngrinding teeth are thoroughly hypsodont. The genus occurred in the older\r\nPleistocene, where it was associated with the last of the †deer-antelope,\r\nor _†Merycodus_ series (_†Capromeryx_), and which, so far as it is known,\r\nwould seem to connect the two families, though this is doubtful. A middle\r\nMiocene genus (_†Dromomeryx_ Fig. 128, p. 237) would be a more probable\r\nancestor of the Prong Buck, if it were not for the long, unfilled gap\r\nof the upper Miocene and the whole Pliocene. _†Dromomeryx_ had erect\r\nhorn-cores placed directly above the eyes as in the modern genus, but\r\nlow-crowned grinding teeth; it was the most ancient American cavicorn\r\nyet known. It remains to be determined by future exploration, whether\r\nthis middle Miocene genus was actually the ancestor of _Antilocapra_, or\r\nmerely an anticipation of it.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Pliocene have been found the remains, very incomplete, of\r\nseveral antelopes, which appear to have been immigrants from the Old\r\nWorld, but are too imperfectly known for any definitive reference. One\r\nresembles the flat-horned, or goat-horned, antelopes of the European\r\nMiocene and Pliocene. Others had spirally twisted horns like those of the\r\nRecent strepsicerine, or twisted-horn antelopes of Africa and Asia, but\r\nmay, nevertheless, be referable to the Antilocapridæ.\r\n\r\nAntelopes even penetrated to South America, and three genera of them\r\nhave been reported from the Pleistocene of the Brazilian caverns and\r\nthe Argentine pampas, but they were less successful in establishing a\r\nfoothold than were the deer, and form no part of the modern Neotropical\r\nfauna.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _Bovidæ. Sheep, Bisons, Oxen, etc._\r\n\r\nA series of genera, of disputed systematic position, is represented\r\nto-day by the so-called Musk-Ox (_Ovibos moschatus_), which is now\r\nexclusively North American, but in the Pleistocene ranged over northern\r\nAsia and Europe as far west as Great Britain. The Musk-Ox, which is at\r\npresent found only in the extreme north, is a heavy, short-legged animal,\r\nthree and a half to four feet high, and six feet or more in length; the\r\nbody is covered with a dense coat of woolly hair overlaid by a thatch of\r\nlong, straight hair, which gives the animal a very shaggy appearance.\r\nThe horns are broad at the base, especially so in old males, in which\r\nthey meet in the middle line and cover much of the head as with a horny\r\ncasque; they curve downward and then upward and forward, with the tips\r\ndirected toward the front; in the females and young males the horns are\r\nvery much smaller.\r\n\r\nThis series cannot be traced back of the Pleistocene, in which epoch\r\nit was not only far more widely distributed, but also very much more\r\ndiversified, no less than three extinct genera, in addition to the\r\nexisting one, having been found in the North American Pleistocene. One\r\nof these (_†Symbos_), which extended from Alaska to Arkansas, had horns\r\nwhich were smaller and shorter than in the modern genus, and, even\r\nwhen fully developed, did not meet in the middle line of the head. The\r\nother two genera, from California (_†Euceratherium_ and _†Preptoceras_\r\nFig. 116, p. 203), are of great interest as showing affinities to the\r\nMusk-Ox and also to sheep and to certain antelopes, such as the Takin\r\n(_Budorcas_) of northern India and Tibet. They serve to connect the\r\nmusk-oxen with other Cavicornia, but the origin of all these animals is\r\nto be sought in Asia.\r\n\r\nIn Recent North America there are four or five species of sheep (_Ovis_)\r\nwhich are confined to the mountainous and broken areas of the western\r\npart of the continent and extend from Alaska to Mexico. The “Bighorn”\r\nor Rocky Mountain Sheep (_Ovis canadensis_) is characterized by great,\r\nspirally coiled horns in the rams, in the ewes the horns are very much\r\nsmaller and nearly straight; the other species differ but slightly from\r\nthis type. The species _O. canadensis_ has been found in the Pleistocene,\r\nbut nothing further is known of its history. Evidently, the sheep were\r\nlate immigrants.\r\n\r\n“The geographical distribution of wild sheep is interesting. The immense\r\nmountain ranges of Central Asia, the Pamir and Thian Shan of Turkestan,\r\nmay be looked on as the centre of their habitat.” “Sheep are essentially\r\ninhabitants of the high mountainous parts of the world, for dwelling\r\namong which their wonderful powers of climbing and leaping give them\r\nspecial advantages. No species frequent by choice either level deserts,\r\nopen plains, dense forests or swamps. By far the greater number of\r\nspecies are inhabitants of the continent of Asia, one extending into\r\nNorth America [should read, four or five] one into Southern Europe and\r\none into North Africa.... No remains that can be with certainty referred\r\nto the genus [_Ovis_] have been met with in the hitherto explored\r\ntrue Tertiary beds, which have yielded such abundant modifications of\r\nAntelopes and Deer.”[10]\r\n\r\nThe only other division of the family which is represented in North\r\nAmerica is that of the bisons, of which the fast vanishing remnant of\r\na single species[11] (_Bison bison_) is all that is left of what was\r\nonce an extensive and varied assemblage. The bisons differ from the\r\ntrue oxen in the form and structure of the skull, in the shoulder-hump,\r\nwhich is produced by the very long spines of the dorsal vertebræ and in\r\nconsequence of which the back slopes downward from the shoulders to the\r\ncroup. They differ further in the character of the hair, which is short\r\nand woolly on the body and hind quarters, very long and shaggy on the\r\nhead and neck. In the Pleistocene of North America there were at least\r\nseven recognizable species of bisons, which ranged over the continent\r\nfrom Alaska to Florida, though it is not probable that they were all\r\ncontemporary. One of the earliest and by far the largest of these was the\r\ngigantic _B. †latifrons_, a specimen of which in the American Museum of\r\nNatural History measures six feet across the horns in a straight line;\r\nthis was a Mississippi Valley species and extended from Ohio to the Gulf\r\nof Mexico and westward to Kansas and Texas. Another gigantic species (_B.\r\n†crassicornis_) lived in Alaska in association with a second and smaller\r\nspecies (_B. †occidentalis_) which ranged as far south as Kansas. _B.\r\n†occidentalis_, though smaller than the preceding species, was larger\r\nthan the existing one and was remarkable for the great size of the hump.\r\nThe bisons were migrants from the Old World and are the only members of\r\nthe great ox-tribe that ever reached America. At present the Old World\r\nhas but a single species of _Bison_ (_B. bonasus_), which has been saved\r\nfrom extermination only by the most rigid protection.\r\n\r\nNeither sheep nor bison extended their range to South America; both are\r\nand have been essentially northern groups and seem to have been unable to\r\ncross the tropics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing account, confused as it unavoidably is, one thing at\r\nleast stands out clearly, that North America played a very insignificant\r\nrôle in the evolution of the Pecora, and has only two peculiar groups,\r\nthe Prong Buck and the American types of deer, and of these, the probable\r\nAmerican ancestry does not extend back of the lower Miocene and perhaps\r\nnot so far. Even in the Old World the story, so far as it has been\r\ndeciphered, is by no means clear and consistent, which is no doubt due to\r\nthe fact that the regions from which Tertiary mammals have been obtained\r\nare so small in comparison with those that have yielded nothing. Certain\r\nbroad outlines of the history may, nevertheless, be discerned.\r\n\r\nThe suborder Pecora at an early date became divided into the two great\r\nbranches of the Cervicornia and Cavicornia, the former giving off the\r\ngiraffe series, which in the Miocene and Pliocene ramified and extended\r\nthrough Asia and southern Europe, though now confined to Africa. In\r\nthe lower Miocene of Europe the muntjac-like deer and the antelopes,\r\nthe first of the Cavicornia, were already well distinguished. From\r\nthe primitive antelopes arose not only the wonderful assemblage of\r\nmodern antelopes, but also the goats and sheep and the great and varied\r\nox-tribe. From the middle Oligocene forms it may obviously be inferred\r\nthat both Cervicornia and Cavicornia united in a single trunk, or, traced\r\nin the other direction, diverged from a common stock, to which also the\r\nsuborder of the Tragulina goes back.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is equally obvious that the camels and llamas have\r\nbeen separated from the Pecora at least since the middle Eocene, and,\r\nconsequently, the many points of agreement between the two suborders,\r\nother than those shared with all artiodactyls, are not due to inheritance\r\nfrom a common ancestry, but have been independently acquired in the\r\ntwo series. It will be instructive to note some of the more important\r\nof these independent similarities: (1) the selenodont and more or\r\nless hypsodont character of the grinding teeth; (2) the spout-shaped\r\nodontoid process of the axis; (3) the great reduction of the ulna and\r\nits coössification with the radius; (4) the loss of the fibula, except\r\nfor its lower end, which persists as a separate malleolar bone; (5)\r\nthe formation of cannon-bones by the fusion of the third and fourth\r\nmetapodials; (6) the development of a complex, many-chambered stomach.\r\nOther points of likeness might be cited, but those already given will\r\nsuffice to show how very important this parallel mode of evolution often\r\nproves itself to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE PROBOSCIDEA\r\n\r\n\r\nUtterly foreign as the elephant-tribe appears to be to present-day North\r\nAmerica, it was a very conspicuous element in the fauna of that continent\r\nfrom the middle Miocene to the end of the Pleistocene, and in the latter\r\nepoch it spread over South America also. Like so many others of the\r\nmammals which have, from time to time, flourished in the Americas, the\r\nelephants and their allies, the †mastodons, were immigrants from the\r\nOld World, and, until comparatively lately, the region of their origin\r\nwas a complete mystery. They appeared suddenly and unheralded and at\r\napproximately the same time in Europe and North America and nothing is\r\nknown from preceding geological formations of either continent which\r\ncould with any plausibility be regarded as ancestral to them. The mystery\r\nwas dispelled by the discoveries of Dr. C. W. Andrews in Egypt, which\r\ndemonstrated that these strange and huge beasts had originated in Africa\r\nand had migrated thence through Asia to Europe, on the one side, and to\r\nNorth America on the other.\r\n\r\nThe proboscideans occupy a very isolated position among the hoofed\r\nmammals, and in structure they display a curious mingling of high\r\nspecialization with an extreme conservatism of primitive characters,\r\nthe specialization being exemplified in the teeth and head and the\r\nconservatism in the body and limbs, very much as in the †oreodont family\r\nof artiodactyls (p. 382). The most conspicuous of the external features\r\nin the order is the long trunk, or proboscis, which gives its name to the\r\ngroup, and is a great prolongation of the nose, with the nostrils at the\r\nend and a finger-like tip, which can be used to pick up minute objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 223.—Molar of the African Elephant (_Loxodonta\r\nafricanus_) showing the oblique mode of wear. Heavy black lines indicate\r\nenamel, enclosing areas of dentine, cement covering the whole tooth.]\r\n\r\nIn the true elephants the dental formula is: _i_ 1/0, _c_ 0/0, _p_ 0/0,\r\n_m_ 3/3, × 2 = 14, though this formula is misleading, to the extent that\r\nthe milk premolars, three in number in each jaw, take the place and\r\nperform the functions of the premolars, thus adding 12 to the effective\r\nnumber of teeth. The single upper incisor on each side grows into an\r\nimmense tusk, which has enamel only on the tip, where it is speedily worn\r\naway; the lower jaw is without incisors and there are no canines above\r\nor below. The grinding teeth are very large and have a highly complex\r\nstructure and a most exceptional method of eruption on coming into use.\r\nThey are thoroughly hypsodont and each is composed of a large number of\r\nhigh, broad and thin plates of dentine covered with enamel and the spaces\r\nbetween the enamel ridges are filled with cement (see Fig. 47, p. 97);\r\nindeed, the whole tooth is so thickly covered with cement that, when\r\nunworn, it looks like a mere lump, with no ridges showing on the surface.\r\nThe teeth increase in size and in the number of component ridges from\r\nbefore backward, and in the Indian species (_Elephas maximus_) the number\r\nof ridges in the six grinding teeth, including the milk premolars, is:\r\n4, 8, 12, 12, 16, 24. In the African Elephant (_Loxodonta africanus_)\r\nthe teeth are not so high and have fewer and thicker plates, the formula\r\nbeing: 3, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10. The teeth do not succeed one another vertically\r\nin the normal mammalian fashion, but come in successively from behind\r\nand the series moves forward, so that the foremost tooth is pushed out,\r\nwhen it is so worn down as to be of no further service. As these teeth\r\nare very large and the jaws are relatively short, only one tooth on\r\neach side, above and below, is in use at the same time, though part of\r\na second may also be involved. The movement of the successive teeth is\r\nnot directly forward, but oblique, an upper tooth coming forward and\r\ndownward and a lower tooth forward and upward. In consequence of this\r\narrangement the teeth are abraded obliquely, the anterior part first\r\ncoming into use, and, by the time a tooth is fully in place, the front\r\nportion is worn down to less than half the height of the hinder part. All\r\nof these peculiarities in the dental system imply a very high degree of\r\nspecialization and a notable difference from other mammals.\r\n\r\nThe skull is equally specialized, as is indeed required by the character\r\nof the teeth and the development of the long and heavy proboscis. The\r\npremaxillæ are converted into sheaths for the great tusks; the nasals\r\nare extremely abbreviated and the anterior nasal opening is shifted to\r\nthe top, directly above the posterior opening, so that the nasal canal\r\npasses vertically downward through the skull. All of the bones forming\r\nthe cranium are enormously thickened and at the same time lightened by\r\nthe formation of an extensive system of communicating sinuses, and thus\r\nthe brain-chamber is, as it were, hidden away in the middle of the huge\r\nmass of the skull. This explains the difficulty of killing an elephant\r\nby shooting it in the head; the shot must be so directed as to reach the\r\nbrain, which requires knowledge and skill.\r\n\r\nThe neck is short, the body long and extremely massive, the tail of\r\nmoderate length. The shoulder-blade is very large and has a prominent\r\nmetacromion given off from the spine; the hip-bones are immensely\r\nexpanded in correlation with the breadth of the thorax and abdomen. The\r\nlimbs are long, massive and columnar, their upper segments, especially\r\nthe thigh, are very long, so that the knee-joint is brought below the\r\nbody and free from it to the position of the hock-joint in the Horse;\r\nhence, the hind leg appears to bend in the opposite direction from the\r\nbend in the legs of ordinary quadrupeds, in which the true knee-joint is\r\nconcealed. The fore-arm bones are separate and, for most of its length,\r\nthe ulna is far heavier than the radius, a wide departure from the\r\nproportions usual in hoofed animals. The femur has no pit in its head for\r\nthe round ligament and no third trochanter; the shaft is broad and much\r\nflattened, having quite lost the normal cylindrical shape. The bones of\r\nthe lower leg are also separate, but the fibula, though stout, is very\r\nmuch more slender than the ulna. The long bones have no marrow-cavities,\r\nbut are filled with spongy bone. The feet are extremely short and broad\r\nand of columnar shape, the weight resting upon a pad of elastic tissue\r\nand the small, nail-like hoofs are mere excrescences upon the periphery.\r\nThere are five digits in manus and pes, but not all of them have hoofs;\r\nin the Indian and West African species the number of hoofs is five in\r\nthe fore foot and four in the hind, in the East African four and three\r\nrespectively. In the adult the skin is quite hairless, though the young\r\ncalf has a considerable quantity of hair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 224.—Right manus of the Indian Elephant (_E.\r\nmaximus_).]\r\n\r\nAt present, the Proboscidea are restricted to the warmer parts of Asia\r\nand Africa, where five species, four of them African, are recognized.\r\nThis is a very great reduction in the number of species and in the area\r\ninhabited during the Pleistocene epoch, when they ranged through every\r\ncontinent, except Australia, and were adapted to every climate from\r\nthe tropics to the shores of the Arctic Sea. Four distinct species of\r\nproboscideans existed in Pleistocene North America, three elephants and a\r\n†mastodon, though not all in the same areas, nor probably all at the same\r\ntime, their ranges both in time and space overlapping to a greater or\r\nless degree, but not exactly coinciding in either respect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 225.—Vertical section through the manus of the Indian\r\nElephant. _U_, lower end of ulna. _L_, lunar. _M_, magnum. _III_, third\r\nmetacarpal. _1_, _2_, _3_, phalanges. _E_, pad of elastic tissue. (After\r\nM. Weber.)]\r\n\r\nThe first species was an immigrant, the northern †Mammoth (_Elephas\r\n†primigenius_), which extended over the greater part of the northern\r\nhemisphere, both in the Old World and in the New. This is the species\r\nof which complete carcasses with hide and hair have been found in the\r\nfrozen gravels of northern Siberia, its structure and appearance being\r\nthus almost as well known as those of any modern elephant. That the\r\n†Mammoth was perfectly adapted to life in a climate of severe cold is\r\nshown not only by the contents of the stomach, which are comminuted\r\nfragments of present-day Siberian vegetation, but also by the dense coat\r\nof woolly hair, covered by long, coarse outer hair, which afforded full\r\nprotection against the cold. The tusks, with considerable variation of\r\nform, had a tendency to spiral curvature, curving first downward and\r\noutward, then upward and inward; the grinding teeth were characterized\r\nby their relative breadth and the numerous thin enamel-ridges which\r\ntraversed them. The number of these ridges was very variable in different\r\nindividuals, but may be expressed for the six successive teeth as\r\nfollows: 3-4, 6-9, 9-12, 9-15, 14-16, 18-27. The skeleton was more\r\nlike that of the Indian Elephant than of the other species, though\r\nwith a number of small differences in the skull. In size, the †Mammoth\r\nwas comparatively small, standing about nine feet six inches at the\r\nshoulders. In North America its range was from Alaska southeastward\r\nacross the continent to New England.\r\n\r\nThe second species, the †Columbian Elephant (_E. †columbi_ Fig. 114, p.\r\n198), was eighteen inches or more taller than the †Mammoth and rivalled\r\nthe largest existing elephants in stature; its huge tusks curved first\r\ndownward and then upward and inward, their tips crossing when full-grown.\r\nThe grinding teeth had fewer and thicker enamel plates than those of\r\nthe †Mammoth. The range of the †Columbian Elephant overlapped the\r\nsouthern border of that of the †Mammoth, but was, on the whole, much\r\nmore southern; it crossed the continent from ocean to ocean and covered\r\nnearly the whole of the United States, extending down to the southern end\r\nof the Mexican plateau. The two species were very closely related and in\r\nsome cases are so intergraded that it is difficult to distinguish them;\r\nthe †Mammoth was an undoubted immigrant and the †Columbian Elephant was\r\nprobably a local North American variant of it, adapted to a somewhat\r\nwarmer climate. Nothing is known of the skin or hair in the latter\r\nanimal, but, from the fact that it was not a tropical species and was\r\nexposed to very cold winters, it may be inferred that it had a hairy\r\ncovering of some sort.\r\n\r\nThe third species of elephant (_E. †imperator_) was older geologically\r\nthan the others, as it was more characteristic of the lower Pleistocene\r\nand uppermost Pliocene; its range coincided with the western half of\r\nthe region covered by _E. †columbi_, extending far into Mexico, but not\r\noccurring east of the Mississippi River. It was an enormous creature, the\r\nlargest of known elephants, with an estimated height of thirteen and a\r\nhalf feet at the shoulder (Osborn). The grinding teeth had thicker and\r\nmore crumpled enamel plates than in either of the other species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 226.—The American †Mastodon (_†Mastodon\r\namericanus_), Pleistocene. Restored from a skeleton in the museum of\r\nPrinceton University.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth of the Pleistocene proboscideans of North America was a member\r\nof a different and much more ancient genus, _†Mastodon_, which in the\r\nOld World became extinct before the end of the Pliocene. The American\r\n†Mastodon (_†M. americanus_) was thus a belated survival of an ancient\r\ntype, seemingly out of place even in the strange Pleistocene world,\r\nwhich had so many bizarre creatures. The distinguishing characteristic\r\nof the genus was in the simple, low-crowned and comparatively small\r\ngrinding teeth, which had three or four prominent transverse ridges,\r\ncovered with heavy enamel, and, usually, with no cement on the crowns.\r\nAs these teeth were so much smaller than those of the elephants, as many\r\nas three on each side of each jaw might be in simultaneous use. In this\r\nspecies there was no vertical succession of teeth, but in some of the\r\nTertiary †mastodons such succession has been observed. The long tusks\r\nwere directed nearly straight forward and were almost parallel, with but\r\nslight curvature, the convexity downward. In the males there was a short\r\nsingle tusk or, less commonly, a pair of such tusks, in the lower jaw,\r\nwhich were probably not visible externally; these were the vanishing\r\nremnants of an earlier stage of development, when the †mastodons had a\r\nfully developed pair of lower tusks, nearly as large as the superior pair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 227.—Last lower molar of the American †Mastodon.]\r\n\r\nThe skull, while essentially proboscidean, was yet much lower and flatter\r\nand less dome-like than in the elephants; the thickening of the cranial\r\nbones was less extreme. The remainder of the skeleton differed so little\r\nfrom that of the elephants as to require no description. In size, this\r\nspecies about equalled the †Mammoth, the larger individuals measuring\r\nnine feet six inches at the shoulder. Remains have been found which prove\r\nthat the American †Mastodon had a covering of long, coarse hair, and that\r\nit fed upon the leaves, shoots and small branches of trees, especially of\r\nconifers. There is much reason to believe that the species outlived the\r\nelephants in this continent and persisted until after the establishment\r\nhere of the American Indian, and it may well have been human agency which\r\nfinally extinguished the dwindling race. The range of the species nearly\r\ncoincided with that of the †Columbian Elephant, but did not extend so\r\nfar into Mexico, and in the central part of the continent reached much\r\nfarther north, even into Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn the Pliocene of Texas, Nebraska and Idaho lived the American\r\nrepresentatives of a genus (_†Stegodon_) which was a connecting link\r\nbetween the elephants and the †mastodons, and which was especially\r\ncharacteristic of the Pliocene of India. The tusks, which were confined\r\nto the upper jaw, had lost their enamel and the last molar, above and\r\nbelow, had five or six enamel ridges, but the crowns, which in the\r\nAsiatic species were buried in cement, had but a small amount of this\r\nmaterial. Several species of _†Mastodon_ occur in the same beds, but only\r\nisolated teeth have been found.\r\n\r\nThe †mastodons, in a broad sense of the term, have been divided into\r\nseveral genera and subgenera in accordance with different schemes; the\r\nsimplest perhaps is to group into a second genus those species which had\r\nfully developed lower tusks. This four-tusked genus has received several\r\nnames, of which _†Tetrabelodon_ is most commonly used in this country,\r\nbut the term _†Gomphotherium_ is much older and, according to the law\r\nof priority, must therefore be employed. The lower Pliocene species of\r\n_†Gomphotherium_ had a pair of large lower tusks, of cylindrical shape,\r\nand both upper and lower tusks had longitudinal bands of enamel, and\r\nin order to support the weight of these great tusks the symphyseal, or\r\nchin, region of the lower jaw was greatly elongated; the molars had four\r\ncross-crests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228.—Head of upper Miocene †mastodon (_†Gomphotherium\r\nproductum_) showing the chisel-like lower tusks. Restored from a skull in\r\nthe American Museum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nIn the upper Miocene is found another and more primitive stage of\r\nproboscidean development. In these species the grinding teeth were\r\nthree-ridged; the upper tusks were quite short and curved downward,\r\ndiverging somewhat from each other, and they had enamel bands. The\r\nlower tusks were still shorter and of depressed, flattened and somewhat\r\nchisel-like form and so worn as to show that they were regularly\r\nemployed in cropping and browsing. The skull was low and broad and the\r\nsymphysis of the lower jaw was greatly prolonged to carry the tusks.\r\n\r\nA very important fact concerning these early †mastodons is that they\r\nhad the normal method of tooth-succession, permanent premolars forming\r\nbeneath (in the lower jaw, above in the upper) the milk-teeth and pushing\r\nthem out at maturity.\r\n\r\nOf the middle Miocene proboscideans not much is known beyond the mere\r\nfact of their presence in North America at that time and indeed little of\r\nthe skeleton, other than the skull, has yet been found in the American\r\nMiocene; but well-nigh complete skeletons have been obtained from the\r\nmiddle Miocene of Europe, and these bring out the surprising fact that\r\nthe body and limbs of these species did not differ in any noteworthy\r\nmanner from those of the existing elephants; the modern skeletal\r\nstructure of these animals had been attained at a time when the dentition\r\nand skull were still in a far less advanced stage of development. In\r\nsize, however, there was a decided difference, the species of the\r\nAmerican Miocene rarely attaining a height of six feet.\r\n\r\nProboscidea have been reported from the lower Miocene of the Great\r\nPlains, but the material is insufficient for a definitive judgment.\r\nThere is no doubt as to their presence in Europe at that time, but in\r\nneither continent can the history be traced any farther and we must\r\nturn to Africa for a backward continuation of the story. In the lower\r\nOligocene of the Fayûm, southwest of Cairo in Egypt, occurs the highly\r\ninteresting genus _†Palæomastodon_, which was much more primitive than\r\nany of the genera described above, though it was an unmistakable member\r\nof the order and even of the family Elephantidæ. The dentition was\r\nalready much reduced, giving the formula: _i_ 1/1, _c_ 0/0, _p_ 3/2,\r\n_m_ 3/3. The upper tusks were short, compressed, directed downward, and\r\nslightly divergent, and had a broad band of enamel on the outer side;\r\nthe lower tusks were still shorter and procumbent, pointing straight\r\nforward, and were covered with enamel, which was very thick on the\r\nlower side and thin or wanting on the upper. All of the grinding teeth\r\nwere in place and function at the same time, which was not true of any\r\nof the genera previously considered, and each of the premolars had its\r\npredecessor in the milk-series, which it succeeded and displaced in the\r\nnormal vertical manner. The premolars were smaller and simpler than the\r\nmolars, which were made up of three pairs of conical tubercles arranged\r\nto form a three-crested crown. The skull, as compared with that of the\r\nelephants, was long and narrow, the premaxillaries extending into a long\r\nsnout; the nasals were shortened, though not so much as in the succeeding\r\ngenera, and there was probably rather a long and flexible snout than a\r\ntrue proboscis. The skull had a long and well-defined sagittal crest,\r\nwhich none of the later genera had, and the development of sinuses in the\r\ncranial bones, though considerable, was much less than in the elephants.\r\nThe occiput was relatively high and the thickened parietals did not tower\r\nabove it to any such degree as they do in the elephants. The symphysis\r\nof the lower jaw was greatly prolonged, extending out beyond the ends of\r\nthe upper tusks, and this implies that the lower lip had a corresponding\r\nprolongation.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton is still incompletely known, though it may be said that the\r\nneck was probably longer than in the subsequent genera of the family.\r\nThe limb-bones were already proboscidean in character, differing only\r\nin details from those of the more typical members of the order, but the\r\nanimal was more lightly built and had less massive limbs. The presence\r\nof the third trochanter on the femur, which is lacking in all of the\r\nsucceeding forms, is an interesting approximation to other and still more\r\nprimitive groups of ungulates. The several species of _†Palæomastodon_\r\nrepresent a considerable range in size, from animals which were not much\r\nlarger than a tapir to those which equalled a half-grown Indian Elephant.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to take another and very long step back from\r\n_†Palæomastodon_, so long, indeed, as to make it apparent that one or\r\nmore links in the chain are still missing. The genus _†Mœritherium_ is\r\nfound together with _†Palæomastodon_ in the lower Oligocene, but also\r\noccurs separately in the upper Eocene. It seems likely that it is a\r\npersistent middle Eocene type and that the known species of it were\r\nsomewhat aside from the main line of descent, but that it very closely\r\nrepresents, nevertheless, a very early stage in the elephant genealogy.\r\nThese known species were quite small animals, about the size of a tapir,\r\nand therefore not much less than the smaller members of _†Palæomastodon_.\r\nThe dental formula of _†Mœritherium_ was: _i_ 3/2, _c_ 1/0, _p_ 3/3, _m_\r\n3/3, × 2 = 36. The first or median upper incisor was a relatively small\r\nand simple tooth, but the second was quite a large, downwardly directed\r\ntusk, which was much smaller and less curved than in _†Palæomastodon_,\r\nand was not capable of indefinite growth. The third incisor and the\r\ncanine were small, spike-like teeth of no functional importance, but\r\ntheir presence is significant as approximating the primitive, unreduced\r\ndentition of the ungulates. The lower incisors were nearly procumbent,\r\nwith a slight upward inclination; the first one was long and the second a\r\nthick, enamel-covered tusk, with a chisel-like edge, which was produced\r\nby wear. The premolars were smaller and simpler than the molars, which\r\nwere quadritubercular, the four conical cusps arranged so as to form\r\ntwo transverse crests, giving a pattern like that of the early pigs and\r\npeccaries and of precisely the kind that might have been predicted from\r\nthe teeth of _†Palæomastodon_.\r\n\r\nThe skull had an utterly different appearance from that of\r\n_†Palæomastodon_, the difference being much greater than between the\r\nlatter and the Miocene _†Gomphotherium_. It was long and narrow, and,\r\nexcept for the very prominent zygomatic arches, of nearly uniform,\r\ntubular shape, the brain-case being of small capacity, though, as\r\ncompared with other Eocene mammals, the brain was proportionately large.\r\n“It is possible that the early tendency toward a considerable cerebral\r\ndevelopment shown in these primitive Proboscidea is one of the causes\r\nwhy the group has survived and flourished through so long a period”\r\n(Andrews). The cranium was very long and the facial region extremely\r\nshort, the premaxillaries not being prolonged into a snout, as they\r\nwere in _†Palæomastodon_; the occipital bones formed nearly the entire\r\nposterior surface of the cranium and even encroached slightly upon the\r\nroof. There was a long, but not very prominent, sagittal crest, and some\r\nof the cranial bones were much thickened; in one species the hinder part\r\nof the cranial walls was distinctly inflated, a beginning of the enormous\r\nthickening which has culminated in the true elephants. The nasal bones\r\nwere already much shortened, though they were twice as long as those of\r\n_†Palæomastodon_, and the animal would appear to have had an incipient\r\nproboscis.\r\n\r\nThe neck was of moderate length and the body very long, with at least\r\ntwenty pairs of ribs, and there was probably a long tail. The hip-bone\r\ndiffered remarkably in its extreme narrowness from that of the later\r\nProboscidea and the limb-bones were much more slender, though not\r\ndissimilar in shape.\r\n\r\nAt a very early period the order became divided into two main branches,\r\none of which includes all the forms so far considered, and the other the\r\nvery strange _†Dinotherium_. The †dinotheres entered Europe together\r\nwith the †mastodons in the lower Miocene and continued into the Pliocene\r\nwithout much change and then died out, leaving no descendants. They\r\nnever invaded North America, probably because they were of more or\r\nless aquatic habit, like the hippopotamuses, and therefore less likely\r\nto find suitable conditions in the narrow and unstable land-bridges\r\nwhich connected the Old World with the New, than were animals of purely\r\nterrestrial habitat. The †dinotheres were of huge size, equalling the\r\nlarger elephants in this respect and closely resembling them in the\r\nskeleton of the body and limbs. As usual in this order, the generic\r\npeculiarities were to be found in the teeth and skull. There were no\r\nsuperior tusks, all the upper incisors and canines being lost, but there\r\nwas a pair of large lower tusks, which were directed downward, with a\r\nstrong backward curvature. The dental formula then was: _i_ 0/1, _c_ 0/0,\r\n_p_ 2/2, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 22. The grinding teeth were relatively quite\r\nsmall and had, except the first molar, two transverse crests, giving a\r\npattern singularly like that seen in the tapirs. The skull was remarkably\r\nlong, low and flat, and no doubt these animals had a proboscis of some\r\nsort. That the †dinotheres were derived from the same ancestral stock as\r\nthe †mastodons and elephants is perfectly obvious and is not questioned\r\nby any one, but it is not yet possible to trace the connection.\r\n\r\nThe proboscideans were late immigrants into South America, being known\r\nthere only in the Pleistocene and late Pliocene times, and only the\r\n†mastodons entered the southern continent, where they gave rise to\r\nseveral peculiar local species in Argentina, Bolivia, Chili and Brazil;\r\none of these (_†Mastodon andium_) had a deposit of cement on the\r\ncrowns of the grinding teeth. Why the elephants, which extended to the\r\nnorthern border of the Neotropical region, should have failed to reach\r\nSouth America and maintain themselves there, is but one of many similar\r\nquestions to which no assured answer can be given.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the Proboscidea was, in a certain sense, very similar\r\nto that of the †oreodont family (p. 381) among the Artiodactyla, in\r\nthat the developmental changes affected chiefly the dentition and the\r\nskull, the skeleton of the body and limbs having very early acquired a\r\ncharacter which was afterward but little modified. Were the skull and\r\nteeth of the lower Miocene _†Gomphotherium_ not known, we should hardly\r\nhesitate to refer the skeleton to the genus _Elephas_, and even in the\r\nOligocene _†Palæomastodon_ all the bones of the skeleton, other than the\r\nskull, were characteristically and unmistakably proboscidean. On the\r\nother hand, the transformations of the teeth and skull were very profound\r\nand far-reaching, very much more so than those which took place in the\r\n†oreodonts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 229.—Evolution of the Proboscidea: on the right, a\r\nseries of skulls; on the left, last lower molar. (After Lull, modified by\r\nSinclair.) N.B. _†Tetrabelodon_ should read _†Gomphotherium_.]\r\n\r\nIn the dentition we may consider separately the development of the\r\ntusks and of the grinding teeth. The first step in the known series, as\r\nexemplified by _†Mœritherium_, was the enlargement of the second incisor\r\nin each jaw to form a tusk which, though actually quite long, was very\r\nsmall when judged by the proboscidean standard. The upper tusk was\r\ndirected vertically downward and the lower one was procumbent, pointing\r\nalmost directly forward; the third incisor and the canine were small and\r\nin the lower jaw already lost. In the next known stage, _†Palæomastodon_,\r\nall of the anterior teeth, except the tusks, had been suppressed; the\r\nupper tusks were longer and more curved and of an oval cross-section;\r\nthey extended less directly downward and more forward, while the enamel\r\nwas restricted to the outer side of the tusk; the lower tusks were more\r\nfully procumbent than in the preceding genus. The third stage, that\r\nof the lower Miocene _†Gomphotherium_, showed the upper tusks greatly\r\nelongated and directed more forward than downward, while the lower\r\ntusks were but little larger than before. From the middle Miocene two\r\nphyla may be distinguished by the tusks alone; in one, which was not\r\ndestined to long life, the lower pair increased greatly both in length\r\nand in diameter, while in the other series they rapidly diminished and\r\neventually disappeared. Even in the Pleistocene, however, the American\r\n†Mastodon had remnants of these tusks in the males. In the later\r\n†mastodons, the †stegodonts, and true elephants, the upper tusks, which\r\nalone remained, lost the enamel bands and attained enormous proportions,\r\ndiffering in the various genera and species in the extent and direction\r\nof curvature. An aberrant mode of tusk development was to be seen in the\r\n†dinotheres, in which the upper pair was suppressed and the lower pair\r\nenlarged and so curved that the points were directed backward.\r\n\r\nThe grinding teeth underwent much more radical and striking changes.\r\nAt first (_†Mœritherium_) they were small, very low-crowned and of\r\nsimple pig-like or quadritubercular pattern, making two interrupted\r\ncross-crests; all were in use simultaneously and the succession of\r\nmilk-teeth and premolars was by vertical replacement, as in normal\r\nmammals generally. In _†Palæomastodon_ there were three pairs of\r\ntubercles on the molars and in _†Gomphotherium_ these coalesced into\r\nridges, but in all the †mastodons there was more or less distinctness\r\nof the conical tubercles. In one or more phyla the three-ridged plan\r\npersisted for a long time, one such phylum terminating in the Pleistocene\r\n_†Mastodon americanus_. In the other series the number of ridges\r\nincreased, first to four, then to five, six and more (_†Stegodon_); the\r\ncrowns of the teeth became much larger and higher, and the ridges, as\r\ntheir number increased, became much thinner, and the valleys between\r\nthem were filled with cement, and finally, in the true elephants, with\r\ntheir fully hypsodont, many-crested teeth, were thickly covered all over\r\nwith cement. The vertical succession of milk-teeth and premolars was\r\nretained in _†Gomphotherium_, at least in some species, but the large\r\nmolars, which could not find room to be exposed while the premolars were\r\nin place, came in successively from behind. This horizontal mode of\r\nsuccession is the only one to be seen in the true elephants, in which but\r\none tooth, or parts of two, on each side of each jaw are in simultaneous\r\nuse and the premolars have entirely disappeared, but the milk-teeth are\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the skull, which amounted to a reconstruction, were\r\nvery largely conditioned by the great increase in the length and\r\nconsequent weight of the tusks, in the size of the grinding teeth and the\r\ndevelopment of the proboscis. In the earliest known type (_†Mœritherium_)\r\nthe skull had little about it that would, at first sight, suggest\r\nproboscidean affinities; it was long and narrow, with sagittal crest\r\nand occiput of normal type, very long cranial and very short facial\r\nregion. The nasal opening was directed forward and the nasal canal was\r\nrelatively long and horizontal in direction, but the nasal bones were\r\nalready much shortened, indicating that the proboscis was probably in\r\nan incipient stage. The symphysis of the lower jaw was procumbent and\r\nsomewhat elongated, but to only a comparatively slight degree.\r\n\r\nWhile the skull of _†Mœritherium_ was not obviously proboscidean, that\r\nof its successor, _†Palæomastodon_, was unmistakably so, yet retained\r\nseveral primitive features, which were lost in all of the subsequent\r\ngenera, such as the sagittal crest, the relatively low cranium and\r\nmoderate thickening of the cranial bones, the forward direction of the\r\nnasal opening, etc.; the symphysis of the lower jaw was very greatly\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\nAs the tusks enlarged and the proboscis grew longer, the weight of\r\nthe head and its appendages necessitated a largely increased area\r\nof attachment for the neck-muscles, and this was attained by a very\r\ngreat thickening of the cranial roof, the occiput not increasing\r\nproportionately; at the same time, the thickened bones were honeycombed\r\nwith sinuses, so as to reduce their weight without sacrifice of strength.\r\nIn those species of the Miocene _†Gomphotherium_ which had large and\r\nheavy tusks, this thickening was not very much less than in the true\r\nelephants. The enlargement of the tusks had other consequences, as, for\r\nexample, in lengthening and broadening the premaxillaries and, in the\r\nelephants, in their downward bending, so as to shorten still further the\r\nfacial region of the skull. With the development of the proboscis, the\r\nnasal bones were reduced to a minimum and the anterior nasal opening was\r\nno longer directed forward, but obliquely upward, while the nasal passage\r\nlost its horizontal direction and became almost vertical. The lower\r\njaw continued to elongate the symphysis, reaching a maximum in certain\r\nspecies of _†Gomphotherium_; but the reverse process of shortening this\r\nanterior region of the jaw began with the reduction of the lower tusks,\r\nand, when these had disappeared, nothing remained of the immensely\r\nelongated symphysis, except the short spout of the elephant’s jaw. As\r\nthe grinding teeth increased in height, there was a concomitant increase\r\nin the vertical depth of the jaws for their lodgment.\r\n\r\nIt was an obvious advantage in the mechanical problem of supporting the\r\nenormous weight of head, tusks and trunk to shorten the neck and thus\r\nbring the weight nearer to the point of support at the withers, the\r\nlengthening proboscis rendering it unnecessary for the mouth to reach the\r\nground in feeding or drinking. The other parts of the skeleton underwent\r\ncomparatively little change, the degree of modification being greatest\r\nbetween _†Mœritherium_ and _†Palæomastodon_. Throughout the series the\r\nbones of the fore-arm and lower leg remained separate, and the feet very\r\nshort and five-toed. In size also the great stature and massiveness were\r\nattained early. After the great migration of the Proboscidea to the\r\nnorthern continents, we find considerable differences of size between the\r\nvarious phyla, though all were very large, and even as early as the lower\r\nMiocene of France, there were species which rivalled the modern elephants\r\nin bulk. It was this rapid attainment of great size and weight which\r\nappears to have been the determining factor in the conservatism of the\r\nskeleton. After the skeleton had become fully adjusted to the mechanical\r\nnecessities imposed by immense weight, and that adjustment, as we have\r\nseen, was effected at a comparatively early period in the history of the\r\norder, then no further modification of importance would seem to have\r\nbeen called for. No doubt the habits and mode of life of these massive,\r\nsedate and slow-moving animals underwent but little change from the\r\nlower Oligocene onward. There is reason to think that _†Mœritherium_ was\r\nsemi-aquatic and a haunter of marshes and streams, but, if so, the change\r\nto a life on dry ground was complete in the lower Oligocene, for the\r\nstructure of _†Palæomastodon_ gives no reason for supposing that it was\r\nanything but a dweller on solid land and a denizen of forests.\r\n\r\nAlthough this book does not undertake to deal with the obscure problems\r\nconnected with the marine mammals, it may be noted in passing that one\r\nof these problems has been brought near to solution, if not actually\r\nsolved, by the discoveries in Egypt and that is the question concerning\r\nthe origin of the Sirenia. The order includes the existing Manatee or\r\nSea-Cow (_Manatus_) of the coast of Florida, northeastern South America\r\nand western Africa, and the Dugong (_Halicore_) of the Indian Ocean.\r\nThese are mammals which are adapted to a strictly marine habitat and are\r\nincapable of existence on land, having lost the hind limbs and converted\r\nthe fore limbs into swimming paddles. Unlike the whales, porpoises\r\nand other Cetacea, the Sirenia are herbivorous and feed upon seaweed\r\nand eel-grass and the aquatic plants of large rivers. The Egyptian\r\ndiscoveries tend very strongly to the conclusion that the Sirenia and\r\nProboscidea were both derived from a common stock and that the genus\r\n_†Mœritherium_ was not very far removed from the probable ancestor from\r\nwhich both of the orders descended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE †AMBLYPODA AND †CONDYLARTHRA\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are two orders of hoofed animals which long ago vanished from the\r\nearth and no member of either is known to have survived later than the\r\nEocene epoch; both were of great antiquity, dating back to the Paleocene,\r\nperhaps even to the Cretaceous. The last of the †Amblypoda are found in\r\nthe lowest Uinta or highest Bridger, but they were relatively abundant in\r\nall the more ancient beds. The following table gives the more important\r\nAmerican forms:\r\n\r\nOrder †AMBLYPODA. †Short-Footed Ungulates\r\n\r\n  Suborder †TALIGRADA\r\n\r\n    I. †PERIPTYCHIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Periptychus_, Paleoc.\r\n\r\n    II. †PANTOLAMBDIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        † _Pantolambda_, Paleoc.\r\n\r\n  Suborder †PANTODONTA\r\n\r\n    III. †CORYPHODONTIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Coryphodon_, Wasatch and Wind River.\r\n\r\n  Suborder †DINOCERATA\r\n\r\n    IV. †UINTATHERIIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _Bathyopsis_, Wind River. _†Elachoceras_, Bridger.\r\n        _†Uintatherium_, do. _†Eobasileus_, do.\r\n\r\nAs is shown in the table, the suborder †Taligrada is entirely Paleocene\r\nin distribution, the †Pantodonta are lower Eocene and the †Dinocerata\r\nchiefly middle Eocene, though persisting into the upper. The †Dinocerata\r\nwere the most striking and characteristic of Bridger mammals, and two\r\nor three phyla of them may be distinguished, though for our purposes\r\nthis is hardly necessary, for these strange and bizarre creatures\r\nwere all very much alike. From the commonest and best-known genus\r\n(_†Uintatherium_) they are called †uintatheres. They were large and\r\nponderous animals, the veritable giants of their time, far exceeding any\r\nof their contemporaries. In appearance they were among the most fantastic\r\nof the many curious beasts which the fossils have revealed.\r\n\r\nThe skull carried three pairs of bony protuberances, or horn-like\r\noutgrowths; one pair on the nasal bones suggest by their shape and\r\ncharacter that they formed the support of dermal horns like those of\r\nthe paired-horn rhinoceroses (_†Diceratherium_) of the Oligocene and\r\nlower Miocene. (See p. 239.) The second pair, which were moderately\r\nhigh and thick prominences, almost cylindrical in shape and tapering\r\nbut slightly to their bluntly rounded ends, were chiefly outgrowths of\r\nthe maxillaries, or upper jaw-bones. From their shape, it is likely\r\nthat these were not sheathed in horn, but were merely covered with\r\nskin, as were also the third pair, which arose from the parietals.\r\nThese were massive, club-shaped prominences, eight or ten inches high\r\nand broadening to the free ends, a shape which makes it impossible to\r\nsuppose that these were true horn-cores covered with horny sheaths. A\r\nhigh crest of bone, representing the occipital crest, enclosed the top\r\nand back of the cranium, connecting the posterior pair of “horns” and\r\ndying away in front of them. The top of the cranium had thus a deep,\r\nbasin-like character, such as is to be found in no mammal outside of this\r\nsuborder and was one of the most peculiar features of this extraordinary\r\nskull. The brain-cavity was absurdly small, the growth of the brain not\r\nhaving kept pace with that of the body; the cavity is hidden away in\r\nthe postero-inferior portion of the skull, the immense thickness of the\r\ncranial walls being somewhat lightened by the formation of sinuses, but\r\nthese were much less extensive and pervasive than in other very large,\r\nhorned or tusk-bearing mammals, such as elephants, rhinoceroses, etc.\r\nProbably, as in the case of the †titanotheres and †entelodonts, this\r\ndeficiency of brain-development was at least one of the factors which led\r\nto the early extinction of the group. The premaxillaries were slender\r\nand rod-like bones, which did not meet in the middle line and carried no\r\nteeth. The long and massive nasal bones and the position of the nasal\r\nopening show that these animals cannot have had a proboscis of any kind.\r\nThe lower jaw was remarkable for the great bony flange which, in the\r\nmales, descended on each side from the lower border, near the anterior\r\nend, and served to protect the great canine tusks from fracture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 230.—Skull of †uintathere (_†Uintatherium alticeps_),\r\nlower jaw supplied from another species. Princeton University Museum. For\r\nrestoration, see Fig. 231, p. 447.]\r\n\r\nThe female skull differed in two respects from that of the male: (1) the\r\nhorn-like protuberances were much more slender and less prominent; (2) as\r\nthe upper canine did not form a tusk, the lower jaw had no flanges. The\r\nskull of the artiodactyl _†Protoceras_ (p. 406) was remarkably similar to\r\nthat of the †uintatheres.\r\n\r\nThe dental formula was: _i_ 0/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 3/3, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 34.\r\nThe upper incisors were completely lost and the lower ones had the very\r\nunusual peculiarity of being bilobate, or having the crown separated\r\ninto two well-defined cusps. The upper canines in the males were very\r\nlarge, relatively thin, recurved and sabre-like tusks, with acute points\r\nand sharp edges, which must have been terrible weapons, though it is\r\ndifficult to see how they were used; probably the mouth was widely\r\nopened, so as to clear the points of the tusks, and the animal then\r\nstruck with them, as a snake does with its fangs. The lower canine was\r\nvery small and was included in the incisor series, the shape and function\r\nof which it had assumed. Thus, the †uintatheres, with their toothless\r\npremaxillaries and, to all appearances, eight lower incisors, formed a\r\ncurious parallel to the true ruminants (Pecora), and, as in the latter,\r\nthey must have had a firm elastic pad on the premaxillaries, against\r\nwhich the lower incisors could effectively bite, when cropping the soft\r\nplants which formed the diet of these great beasts. The grinding teeth\r\nwere low-crowned and surprisingly small in comparison with the size of\r\nthe skull. The premolars and molars were nearly alike and had two or more\r\ntransverse crests.\r\n\r\nAside from the altogether exceptional character of the skull, the\r\nskeleton was quite strikingly elephantine in appearance, so much so, in\r\nfact, that these animals have repeatedly been referred to the Proboscidea\r\nand some writers are still of the opinion that the two orders were\r\nrelated. There is, however, no sufficient ground for this view; the\r\nundeniable likenesses are much more probably to be ascribed to the\r\noperation of convergent development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231.—One of the elephantine †amblypods\r\n(_†Uintatherium alticeps_) of the Bridger stage. Male in foreground,\r\nfemale behind. Restored from specimens in the museums of Yale and\r\nPrinceton universities.]\r\n\r\nThe neck was of moderate length, sufficiently long to enable the\r\nanimal to reach the ground with the lips, a necessity in the absence\r\nof a proboscis. The body was very long and, as is shown by the length\r\nand curvature of the ribs and the great breadth of the hip-bones,\r\nextremely bulky. The limbs were very massive, and the long bones had\r\nlost the marrow-cavities, being filled with spongy bone, as in the\r\nelephants, †titanotheres and most other very heavy mammals. The bones\r\nof the fore-arm and lower leg were separate. The hip- and thigh-bones\r\nand shin-bones were remarkably elephantine in character and, if found\r\nisolated, might readily be referred to some unknown proboscidean, but the\r\nbones of the fore limb were quite different from those of the elephants.\r\nThe feet likewise had a very proboscidean appearance, notwithstanding\r\nimportant and significant deviations in structure; they had the same\r\nshortness and massiveness and a similar reduction in the size of the\r\nhoofs, and the presence of all five digits added to the resemblance.\r\nUndoubtedly, the feet had the same columnar shape and arrangement of\r\nelastic pads. The living animal must have had an appearance quite similar\r\nto that of a rather small elephant, not exceeding six or seven feet in\r\nheight at the shoulders and therefore not surpassing the largest modern\r\nrhinoceroses, the broad-lipped species of Africa (_Opsiceros simus_).\r\nOf course, the head must be excepted from the comparison, as that was\r\ntotally unlike the head of any existing creature; with its long and\r\nnarrow shape, its fantastic protuberances and its lack of a proboscis,\r\nit had no suggestion of likeness to any proboscidean. Whether the great\r\nbody was naked, or clothed with hair, it is of course impossible to\r\ndetermine with confidence, but, all things considered, it seems unlikely\r\nthat the hair should have been completely lost in any terrestrial mammal\r\nat so early a period. As we have seen in the preceding chapters, hairy\r\nelephants and rhinoceroses continued into and through the Pleistocene,\r\nnot only in the cold regions of the north, as is shown by the hair of\r\nthe American †Mastodon. In the tropics conditions were different, and in\r\nthat uniformly warm climate the loss of hair by the very large mammals\r\nprobably took place long before the Pleistocene. At all events, it is\r\na significant fact that no hairless land mammals are now known in any\r\nregion which has severe winters. It is true that the middle Eocene\r\nclimate over most of North America was warm-temperate or subtropical,\r\nand the †uintatheres may, in consequence, have been hairless, but there\r\nis no evidence of this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 232.—Skull of _†Elachoceras parvum_ (lower jaw\r\nrestored). Princeton University Museum.]\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of the †uintathere family, considerable modification\r\nand change may be traced, which, as in the case of the Proboscidea,\r\nprincipally affected the skull and the general stature. It is hardly\r\nworth while to deal separately with the two or more phyla which may\r\nbe distinguished, for the differences between them are relatively\r\nunimportant. In the uppermost part of the Bridger stage almost the latest\r\nrepresentatives of the family are found and the genus (_†Eobasileus_)\r\nwas of the largest size. These animals had remarkably long and narrow\r\nheads and very large, shovel-shaped nasal protuberances; in the males the\r\nupper canine tusks were very long and curved back nearly in a semicircle.\r\nIn the middle portion of the stage the species of _†Uintatherium_ were\r\nsomewhat smaller and had shorter, wider and higher heads, the tusks,\r\nthough well developed, were not quite so long, nor so strongly recurved;\r\nin some species they were nearly straight, with “hastate” or spear-head\r\npoint. In the same horizon is found a third genus (_†Elachoceras_)\r\nwhich was probably a survival persisting from the lower Bridger, in\r\nwhich none of these animals and little of anything else has yet been\r\nfound. _†Elachoceras_ was hardly half as large as the common species of\r\n_†Uintatherium_ and its skull might be described as a preliminary sketch\r\nfor that of the latter; the nasal horns were extremely small, or, more\r\nprobably, entirely absent; the median pair were mere low knobs, hardly\r\nan inch in height, and the posterior pair were simply thickenings of the\r\ncrest which enclosed the top of the cranium on three sides, scarcely\r\nrising above it. This crest itself was much less prominent than in\r\n_†Uintatherium_ and the basin-like top of the skull, in consequence, very\r\nmuch shallower. The upper incisors and the first premolar had already\r\nbeen lost and the upper canine enlarged into a sabre-like tusk, which,\r\nhowever, was relatively smaller than in the succeeding genera. The\r\ngrinding teeth were quite the same as in the latter. Unfortunately, the\r\nskull of _†Elachoceras_ is the only part of the animal which is known,\r\nbut, so far as that is concerned, it is precisely what we should expect\r\nthe forerunner of _†Uintatherium_ to be; an ancestor made to order could\r\nhardly be more diagrammatic. It might, of course, be objected that no\r\nsuch relation as that of ancestor and descendant could obtain between\r\nthese two genera, because they were contemporaries, but the case is like\r\nthat of the ancestral elephants described in the preceding chapter.\r\n_†Mœritherium_ and _†Palæomastodon_ are found together in the Egyptian\r\nOligocene, the former surviving for a considerable time after it had\r\ngiven rise to the latter, and in the upper Eocene only _†Mœritherium_\r\noccurs. Many similar instances might be given, just as grandfathers often\r\nlive long with their grandchildren.\r\n\r\nIn the Wind River stage, or upper division of the lower Eocene, lived the\r\nstill incompletely known _†Bathyopsis_, of which, however, sufficient\r\nmaterial has been obtained to show that it was much less specialized than\r\nany of the Bridger genera. This genus comprised animals much smaller\r\nthan its successor, _†Elachoceras_ of the middle Eocene, being smaller\r\nthan a tapir; it stood in much the same relation to _†Elachoceras_ as\r\nthe latter did to _†Uintatherium_. In the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory is a highly interesting skull of _†Bathyopsis_, which will\r\nshortly be described by Professor Osborn. The premaxillaries have not\r\nbeen preserved, and it is therefore impossible to say whether the upper\r\nincisors had already been suppressed or not, and though the upper canine\r\nhas not been found, there can be no reasonable doubt that it was a tusk.\r\nThe lower canine had not yet gone over to the incisor series, but was\r\na thin though large tusk. There was one more lower premolar, four in\r\nall, than _†Uintatherium_ possessed, and all the premolars were somewhat\r\nsmaller and simpler than the molars. The small skull had a broad and\r\nsomewhat concave cranial roof, with slightly raised enclosing crest,\r\nand the horn-like protuberances of the posterior and median pairs were\r\npresent in an incipient stage. Whether those of the nasal pair were also\r\nindicated is not known, but probably they were not. The lower jaw was of\r\nvery peculiar shape; the flange of the inferior border was not so well\r\ndefined as in _†Uintatherium_, but had no hinder margin and rose very\r\ngradually backward.\r\n\r\nThe series of genera in descending order, _†Eobasileus_, _†Uintatherium_,\r\n_†Elachoceras_ and _†Bathyopsis_, immediately impresses the observer\r\nas being a natural phylogenetic series of successive ancestors and\r\ndescendants. Unfortunately, only the skull is known in the two last\r\nnamed, but there is no ground for supposing that the discovery of the\r\nskeletons would require any alteration in the series as we now have\r\nit. No member of this series has yet been found in the Wasatch, but\r\nthere can be no doubt that it was represented in that stage, for a\r\nrecent expedition from the American Museum has collected teeth of a\r\n_†Bathyopsis_-like form in still older beds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER †PANTODONTA\r\n\r\nDuring the older part of the lower Eocene the †uintatheres must have\r\nbeen a rare and unimportant element of the fauna, at least in those\r\nparts of the continent whose history we know. Their place was taken by\r\nanother suborder, the †Pantodonta, which was not ancestral to them, but\r\ncollaterally related and descended from a common ancestry. The largest\r\nand most dominating of Wasatch mammals was the genus _†Coryphodon_, which\r\nalso occurred in the lower Eocene of Europe, and the species of which\r\nranged in stature from a tapir to an ox, though of much heavier form than\r\nthe latter. The latest surviving species lived in the Wind River stage as\r\na contemporary of _†Bathyopsis_, but then the suborder gave way to the\r\n†uintatheres.\r\n\r\nIn _†Coryphodon_ (see Fig. 142, p. 279) the number of teeth was\r\nunreduced, a fact which is recorded in the name of the suborder, the\r\ndental formula typical of all the primitive ungulates being applicable\r\nto the genus. This formula was: _i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 4/4, _m_ 3/3, ×\r\n2 = 44. The upper incisors were rather small, but functional, and the\r\ncanines of both jaws were formidable tusks, though not rivalling in\r\nsize the great sabres of the †uintatheres; the premolars had a simpler\r\nstructure than the molars, which resembled those of the †uintatheres in\r\na general way, but not closely. The skull differed greatly from that of\r\nthe †uintatheres in having no horn-like protuberances, and was relatively\r\nlarge and heavy, the cranium having a broad, flat roof and no sagittal\r\ncrest, and the lower jaw had no descending flange from the inferior\r\nborder; in every way this skull was more normal and less bizarre-looking.\r\nThe neck was proportionately longer than in the †uintatheres, the body\r\nlong and the tail of medium length; the trunk-vertebræ had surprisingly\r\nsmall and weak spines, perhaps an indication of aquatic habits. The limbs\r\nwere quite short and very heavy, and the bones, in comparison with those\r\nof the †uintatheres, were less proboscidean and more perissodactyl in\r\ncharacter. For example, the femur retained the third trochanter and the\r\nlong bones had marrow-cavities. The feet, on the contrary, were very like\r\nthose of the †uintatheres, being extremely short and five-toed and with\r\nreduced, nodular hoof-bones; even in the details of the wrist and ankle\r\njoints there was no important difference between the two groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER †TALIGRADA\r\n\r\nNone of the ungulate series considered in the foregoing chapters can be\r\ntraced back to a time earlier than the Wasatch, and many of them not\r\nso far, but in the case of the †Amblypoda the line may be carried down\r\nthrough the Paleocene. In the upper stage of that epoch (Torrejon) the\r\norder was represented by _†Pantolambda_ (Fig. 143, p. 285), a member of\r\nthe third suborder, †Taligrada. The best-known species of the genus was\r\nan animal with head and body somewhat smaller than those of a sheep and\r\nmuch shorter legs. The teeth were present in unreduced number, 44 in\r\nall; the canines were tusk-like, but very much smaller proportionately\r\nthan those of _†Coryphodon_; the premolars were smaller and simpler than\r\nthe molars, which closely represent the common starting point, whence\r\nthe curious tooth-patterns found in the subsequent genera of the various\r\nfamilies were derived. The skull was long and narrow and had a prominent\r\nsagittal crest; the neck was of ordinary length, about equal to that\r\nof the head; the body was long and the tail very long, much as in the\r\ngreat cats. The hip-bones were narrow and slender and not bent outward,\r\nhaving no such breadth as in _†Coryphodon_. The limbs were short and\r\nrelatively heavy, and the various bones were of such primitive character\r\nthat, if found isolated and not in association with teeth or foot-bones,\r\none would hardly venture to consider them as belonging to any hoofed\r\nanimal; the humerus had a very prominent deltoid crest and an epicondylar\r\nforamen, and the femur had the third trochanter. The five-toed feet\r\nwere very short, and the digits were arranged in a spreading manner and\r\nwere relatively much more slender than in _†Coryphodon_. Each digit\r\nterminated in a flat, pointed, well-developed hoof; evidently there was\r\nno elastic pad to bear the weight, such as recurs in nearly all very\r\nheavy ungulates. The gait of the animal was probably semi-plantigrade,\r\nthe hoofs being the principal points of support.\r\n\r\nWhile _†Pantolambda_ was an undoubted ungulate and a member of the\r\n†Amblypoda, there were many structural features in its skeleton which\r\npoint to a relationship with the primitive flesh-eaters. In the lower\r\nstage of the Paleocene, the Puerco, the genus _†Periptychus_ would seem\r\nto be the most ancient known member of the order, but it is still very\r\nimperfectly understood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the mode of evolution of the †Amblypoda, so far as that is recorded by\r\nthe fossils, there is much to recall the development of the Proboscidea,\r\nthough the story began and ended at far earlier dates and may be traced\r\nback to a much more primitive stage.\r\n\r\n(1) There was a rapid increase of stature, especially of bulk, in the\r\n†coryphodonts, but decidedly more gradual in the †uintatheres, which\r\neventually attained a far larger size.\r\n\r\n(2) The upper incisors were suppressed and the canines grew into\r\nformidable tusks, at first straight, then the superior one, enlarging\r\nstill farther, acquired a curved, scimitar-like shape, while the inferior\r\none dwindled and became functionally one of the incisors.\r\n\r\n(3) The grinding teeth remained low-crowned throughout, but acquired a\r\nmore complex pattern, and the premolars became almost like the molars.\r\n\r\n(4) The skull underwent a most remarkable transformation. Beginning with\r\na form that might have belonged to almost any of the ancient mammals,\r\nhoofed or clawed, having very prominent sagittal and occipital crests,\r\nlong cranium and short face, it became in _†Coryphodon_ flat-roofed,\r\nwith moderately elongated face, while in the †uintatheres the top of\r\nthe cranium gradually took on a deeply concave basin-shape and, with\r\nequal gradualness, three pairs of horn-like protuberances; the lower jaw\r\ndeveloped a great bony flange for the protection of the upper tusks.\r\nThese peculiarities grew more and more exaggerated and were most\r\nstriking in the terminal genus of the series, _†Eobasileus_.\r\n\r\n(4) Unfortunately, nothing is yet known of the skeleton of _†Bathyopsis_\r\nand _†Elachoceras_, so that it is not practicable to follow out all the\r\nstages of skeletal modification, though the general course of development\r\nis sufficiently plain. The neck did not change greatly, except to become\r\nvery strong and heavy and to grow shorter proportionately as the skull\r\nwas lengthened. The body remained long throughout the series, but gained\r\ngreatly in bulk, as the stature of the animal increased.\r\n\r\n(5) The limb-bones lost their primitive character, such as the\r\nepicondylar foramen of the humerus and the third trochanter of the\r\nfemur, and then, with the great increase of the weight to be supported,\r\nthe marrow-cavities were filled with spongy bone and the hip-bones\r\nincreased enormously in width; the femur lost its cylindrical shape\r\nand was flattened antero-posteriorly, which gave it a very elephantine\r\nappearance. None of the limb-bones was suppressed or greatly reduced in\r\nsize, nor was there any coössification between them.\r\n\r\n(6) The feet early gained their definitive character; at no time was\r\nthere any loss of digits, but the originally divided toes were, in the\r\ngenera of the Wasatch and subsequent stages, united into the columnar\r\nfoot, and the hoofs were reduced from their primitively pointed shape to\r\nnodular form.\r\n\r\nAs in the Proboscidea, therefore, there was comparatively little change\r\nin the skeleton after the massive and bulky proportions had been\r\nacquired, but great and continual modification of the skull. At the time\r\nwhen the †Amblypoda finally disappeared, no ungulate had acquired the\r\nhypsodont dentition. Had the group survived till the middle Miocene, a\r\ntime when the spread of grassy plains so profoundly affected the feeding\r\nhabits of many herbivorous mammals, the high-crowned teeth might have\r\nbeen developed in them also, and this, in turn, would have produced other\r\nchanges in the skull, making closer the parallel with the Proboscidea.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a few words may be said concerning the geographical\r\ndistribution of the †Amblypoda. In the Paleocene the only known\r\nrepresentatives of the order were those of North America, but the\r\n†coryphodonts of the lower Eocene migrated to the Old World; indeed, the\r\ngenus _†Coryphodon_ was first described and named from English specimens,\r\nbut there were no such abundance and variety of these animals in Europe\r\nas there were in the western United States. The †uintatheres were\r\nstrictly North American in distribution and no member of the suborder\r\nhas ever been found outside of this continent. Animals referred to the\r\n†Amblypoda by some authorities have been obtained in the Oligocene\r\nand Miocene of South America, but the assignment has been made upon\r\ninsufficient evidence. (See p. 508.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER †CONDYLARTHRA\r\n\r\nThe †Condylarthra were a group of exceedingly primitive ungulates, which\r\nserved to connect the hoofed and clawed mammals in quite an intimate\r\nmanner. So few indeed were the distinctively ungulate characters which\r\nthey had acquired, that it is still premature to make any positive\r\nstatements regarding their geographical distribution, because unusually\r\nwell-preserved specimens are required to make sure of their presence\r\nin any particular region. Concerning North America there is no room\r\nfor question, and there is hardly any doubt that they existed in the\r\nPaleocene of Europe. The South American remains which have been referred\r\nto this order may very well prove eventually to belong to it properly,\r\nbut until both feet and skulls have been obtained in unequivocal\r\nassociation, the reference can be only tentative. In North America they\r\nranged through the Paleocene and lower Eocene, but are not known from any\r\nsubsequent formation, and even in the Wind River only a few stragglers\r\nsurvived.\r\n\r\nThe principal American families and genera are as follows:\r\n\r\n    I. †MENISCOTHERIIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Meniscotherium_, Wasatch and Wind River.\r\n\r\n    II. †PHENACODONTIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Protogonodon_, Puerco. _†Euprotogonia_, Torrejon.\r\n        _†Phenacodus_, Wasatch and Wind River.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _†Phenacodontidæ_\r\n\r\nThe typical Wasatch genus _†Phenacodus_, which is very fully known from\r\nnearly complete skeletons, included species which varied in size from a\r\nfox to a small sheep; the same genus occurred in the Wind River, but not\r\nlater. _†Phenacodus_ had the unreduced dental formula: _i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1,\r\n_p_ 4/4, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 44.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 233.—Skeleton of the Wasatch †condylarth,\r\n_†Phenacodus primævus_. American Museum. For restoration, see Fig. 141,\r\np. 278.]\r\n\r\nThe incisors were small and simple, the canines tusk-like, but of no\r\nvery great size, the premolars smaller and simpler than the molars. The\r\nlatter were of the quadrituberculate pattern, of four simple, conical\r\ncusps arranged in two pairs, a pattern which is common to the earlier\r\nand less specialized members of many ungulate groups. The skull was\r\nlong, narrow and low, with long and well-defined sagittal crest. As\r\nin primitive skulls generally, the cranial region was long and the\r\nface short, the eyes being very far forward; this does not imply large\r\nbrain-capacity, indeed, the brain was very small, but merely that the\r\nportion of the skull behind the eyes was relatively long. The jaws were\r\nshort and shallow, in accordance with the small and low-crowned teeth\r\nwhich they carried. The neck was of medium length, but the body was\r\nelongate and the tail was very long and stout. The hip-bones were narrow\r\nand slender, as in primitive ungulates generally. The limbs were short\r\nand stout and retained many very primitive characteristics. The humerus\r\nhad a prominent deltoid crest and an epicondylar foramen; the fore-arm\r\nbones were separate and the ulna quite unreduced, being almost as stout\r\nas the radius. The femur had the third trochanter and the leg-bones were\r\ndistinct, though the fibula was slender. The feet, which were short, had\r\nfive digits each, but the third toe was enlarged, while the first and\r\nfifth were shortened, as though preparing to disappear and thus give rise\r\nto a three-toed perissodactyl foot. The ankle-bone (astragalus) had a\r\nrounded, convex lower end, fitting into the navicular, so that it might\r\nreadily be taken for that of a clawed mammal.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _†Meniscotheriidæ_\r\n\r\nA second family of Condylarthra was represented in the lower Eocene by\r\nthe genus _†Meniscotherium_ and was in some respects considerably more\r\nadvanced than the †phenacodonts. These were small animals, in which the\r\nmolars had acquired a crescentic pattern, recalling that seen in the\r\nearly horses and in the †titanotheres and †chalicotheres, and other\r\nperissodactyl families. In the upper molars the two external cusps\r\nhad been so extended as to form a continuous outer wall, each of the\r\ncusps having a concave external face and the two uniting in a prominent\r\nmedian ridge. The lower molars had two crescents, one behind the other,\r\nas in several families of both perissodactyls and artiodactyls. The\r\nbody and tail were long, the limbs relatively longer and lighter than\r\nthose of _†Phenacodus_ and the five-toed feet were so like those of\r\nthe modern conies, or klipdasses, of Africa and Asia Minor, that by\r\nsome investigators the family has been referred to the same order, the\r\nHyracoidea, but the suggestion is not a probable one. It is much more\r\nlikely that these problematical little †meniscotheres were merely a\r\nshort-lived branch of the †Condylarthra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 234.—Lower Eocene †condylarth, _†Meniscotherium\r\nterræ-rubræ_. Restored from a skeleton in the American Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe †condylarths were quite abundantly represented in the Paleocene,\r\nwhere the genus _†Euprotogonia_ was the forerunner of the Wasatch\r\n_†Phenacodus_, but had an even more primitive type of dentition. The\r\nupper molars were not quadritubercular, but tritubercular, the three\r\ncusps arranged in a triangle, the two outer ones forming the base and\r\nthe single inner one the apex. This type of upper molar was, or is\r\nstill, common to the primitive and unspecialized members of a great\r\nmany mammalian orders, marsupials, insectivores, rodents, carnivores,\r\nlemurs, artiodactyls, etc., and there is strong reason to believe that\r\nthe tritubercular molar was the common starting point for almost all\r\ntypes of mammalian dentition. However that may be, _†Euprotogonia_ is of\r\ngreat interest as materially helping to close the gap between the clawed\r\nand the hoofed mammals, belonging, as it did, to the latter and yet\r\nretaining in dentition, limbs and feet so many characteristics of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n†Condylarthra were probably present in the lowest Paleocene (Puerco\r\nstage), but the material so far obtained is so fragmentary that there can\r\nbe no certainty on this point.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all probable that any of the North American †Condylarthra\r\nshould be regarded as ancestral to any of the more advanced ungulate\r\ngroups; on the contrary, they would appear to have come to an end in\r\nthe Wind River, leaving no descendants behind them. It is further true,\r\nas was mentioned above, that the presence of †Condylarthra in other\r\ncontinents, while very probable, cannot be positively asserted, because\r\nthe evidence is incomplete. Yet it would be a great mistake to assume,\r\nfor this reason, that these most primitive of ungulates were devoid of\r\nevolutionary importance and interest. As is so often the case, where,\r\nin the absence of the direct ancestry, the collateral relations afford\r\nvery valuable information as to the course of descent and modification,\r\nthe †Condylarthra throw useful light upon the origin of the ungulate\r\ngroups. It is extremely probable that the †condylarths, or some very\r\nsimilar series of primitive hoofed mammals, had a very wide and perhaps\r\ncosmopolitan range at the end of the Cretaceous and beginning of the\r\nTertiary period, and that, in the still unidentified region, where the\r\nartiodactyls and perissodactyls arose, it was from a condylarthrous\r\nancestry. Possibly, all the other ungulate orders may yet be traced\r\nback to the same stock, but it is rather more likely that the ungulates\r\ninclude several series of quite independent origin. At all events, it is\r\nquite certain that the clawed mammals long antedated the hoofed types and\r\nthat the latter arose, either once or at several separate times, from the\r\nformer. The †Condylarthra show how one, at least, of these transitions\r\nwas effected, and thus, in principle, how all were accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE †TOXODONTIA (OR †NOTOUNGULATA)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a regrettable circumstance that, while the successive Tertiary\r\nfaunas are very fully represented in South America, approximately\r\ncomplete skeletons have, as yet, been obtained from only a few of the\r\nvarious stages; from the others the known material is very fragmentary\r\nand largely made up of teeth and jaws. No doubt, the history of\r\nfossil-collecting in North America will, in due course of time, be\r\nrepeated in the southern continent and more and more complete and\r\nsatisfactory specimens be obtained. At present, however, it is not\r\npossible to trace the modifications of structure in any given series\r\nwith such detail as in those which were developed within the limits of\r\nArctogæa. No such story as that of the horses, the rhinoceroses or the\r\ncamels, can yet be told of the South American groups, whatever future\r\nexploration may teach us. Nevertheless, much has already been learned\r\nconcerning the strange creatures that once inhabited the Neotropical\r\nregion and long ago vanished completely, leaving no trace in the modern\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs was mentioned in Chapter VI, on the present geographical distribution\r\nof mammals, South America is to-day the richest and, after Australia,\r\nthe most peculiar zoölogically of all the regions. All of the modern\r\nhoofed animals found in that continent at present, the tapirs, peccaries,\r\nllamas and deer, are immigrants derived at a comparatively late date from\r\nthe north, but throughout the Tertiary and the Pleistocene there were\r\nseveral indigenous types of ungulates, and of these the largest and most\r\nvaried assemblage was that included in the order †Toxodontia. The most\r\nimportant and best known of the families and genera are listed in the\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n  Suborder †TOXODONTA. †Toxodonts Proper\r\n\r\n    I. †TOXODONTIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Toxodon_, up.

For many years\r\n_†Toxodon_, of which hardly anything was known, save the skull and teeth,\r\nwas a zoölogical puzzle and no one was able to reach any satisfactory\r\nconclusion as to its systematic position and relationships, as all the\r\nattempts made to force it into one of the known ungulate groups were\r\nobvious failures. The discovery of complete skeletons, two of which\r\nare mounted in the La Plata Museum, showed the necessity of making a\r\nnew group for its reception, as Owen had originally proposed. Through\r\nthe exploration of Argentina and its Patagonian provinces, the history\r\nof the suborder was followed far back into the Tertiary period and its\r\nindigenous character demonstrated. This and all the other subdivisions\r\nof the †Toxodontia were exclusively Neotropical in distribution, and\r\nnone have been found farther north than Nicaragua and there only in the\r\nPleistocene.\r\n\r\nThe suborder was represented in the Pampean beds by several genera,\r\nwhich differed in size and in the complexity of the grinding teeth,\r\nbut only of _†Toxodon_ is the skeleton at all fully known. The Pampean\r\nspecies of this genus were massive, elephantine creatures, rivalling\r\nthe largest rhinoceroses in bulk, but not equalling them in height. The\r\nteeth were all thoroughly hypsodont and apparently continued to grow\r\nthroughout life without forming roots; the dental formula was: _i_ 2/3,\r\n_c_ 0/0, _p_ 3/3, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 34. The first upper incisor was broad\r\nand chisel-shaped, the second more tusk-like, but in some species these\r\nproportions were reversed; the lower incisors were procumbent, pointing\r\nstraight forward, and of these the third was the largest. The canines\r\nwere lost and there was a long, toothless gap behind the incisors. The\r\npremolars were smaller and simpler than the molars, and the anterior ones\r\nwere very small and were frequently shed at an early stage, making the\r\nnumber of these teeth variable in different specimens. The upper molars\r\nalso were of quite simple pattern; the broad and smooth external wall\r\nshowed no distinct signs of a division into cusps, and from it arose\r\ntwo oblique transverse ridges; the deep cleft or valley which separated\r\nthese ridges was divided and made Y-shaped on the grinding surface by a\r\nprominent spur from the outer wall between the two principal crests. The\r\nlower molars were composed of two crescents, one behind the other, of\r\nwhich the posterior one was very much longer, and both were very narrow\r\ntransversely.\r\n\r\nThe skull had shortened nasal bones, an indication that some sort of a\r\nproboscis or prehensile upper lip was present. There was no trace of a\r\nhorn, and the general aspect of the skull was not unlike that of one\r\nof the hornless rhinoceroses, except for its great vertical depth; the\r\nsagittal crest was very short and had almost disappeared. The auditory\r\napparatus was very extraordinary, though it can hardly be described\r\nwithout an undue employment of anatomical terms; suffice it to say that\r\nin addition to the usual outer ear-chamber, formed by the inflated\r\ntympanic bone, there was a second chamber in the rear wall of the skull,\r\ncommunicating with the first by a canal. This arrangement would seem to\r\nimply an unusual keenness in the sense of hearing. The external entrance\r\nto the ear was placed very high up on the side of the head, as in the\r\npigs and in many aquatic mammals, suggesting that _†Toxodon_ was more or\r\nless amphibious. The anterior, or symphyseal, region of the lower jaw was\r\nvery broad, flattened and shovel-like, hardly projecting at all below the\r\nplane of the lower incisors.\r\n\r\nThe neck was short and stout, the body long and extremely bulky, having\r\nan immense, almost hippopotamus-like girth; the spines of the anterior\r\ndorsal vertebræ were very long, making a high hump at the shoulders. The\r\nlimbs were short and very heavy, the bones very massive and with large\r\nprojections for muscular attachments. The fore leg was much shorter than\r\nthe hind, depressing the neck and head in very curious fashion. The\r\nshoulder-blade was rather narrow, the spine without acromion or distinct\r\nmetacromion; the hip-bones were greatly expanded and turned outward,\r\nquite in elephant-like fashion, a character which almost invariably\r\naccompanies great increase in bodily mass. The thigh-bone was also very\r\nelephantine in appearance, a likeness due to its shape and proportions,\r\nto the loss of the third trochanter and the flattening of the shaft, so\r\nthat the width much exceeded the antero-posterior thickness. All of these\r\ncharacters are, as a rule, associated with greatly augmented weight and\r\nhave been independently acquired in several series of large and massive\r\nanimals, elephants, †uintatheres, †titanotheres, and to this list should\r\nbe added the †toxodonts. In the fore-arm the bones were separate and the\r\nulna was quite unreduced and very stout, but in the lower leg, which\r\nwas very short in comparison with the thigh, the tibia and fibula were\r\ncoössified at the upper end, but not at the lower, a most exceptional\r\narrangement. The feet were surprisingly small and had but three digits,\r\nthe reduction from the original five having proceeded to that extent\r\nbefore the process was arrested by augmenting weight. The heel-bone\r\n(calcaneum) was so articulated with the other bones of the tarsus as to\r\nproject almost straight backward, nearly at a right angle to the position\r\nnormal in a digitigrade foot, a feature which is not known to occur in\r\nany other mammal. The hoof-bones were so small and nodular that the foot\r\nmust have been of the columnar type, the weight resting upon the usual\r\nelastic pad.\r\n\r\nThe restoration (Fig. 121, p. 217) shows _†Toxodon_ as a very heavy,\r\nslow-moving, water-loving animal; the aquatic habits are, of course,\r\nconjectural, but the general proportions are accurately given by the\r\nskeleton.\r\n\r\nFrom the Pleistocene, _†Toxodon_ may be followed back without notable\r\nchange to the Pliocene, but there it was in association with the last\r\nof a curious phylum, the genus _†Trigodon_ (Fig. 138, p. 263), as yet\r\nknown only from the skull. In these animals a very prominent bony knob\r\nor boss on the forehead clearly demonstrates the former presence of a\r\nlarge, rhinoceros-like, frontal horn. But very few of the indigenous\r\nSouth American ungulates possessed horns, or horn-like protuberances of\r\nthe skull, and all of these so far discovered belonged to the suborder\r\n†Toxodonta. _†Trigodon_ was, from present knowledge, the only horned\r\ncreature of its time and region, for the deer and antelopes which had\r\nprobably arrived in South America had not advanced so far south as\r\nArgentina. Another very peculiar feature of this genus was that the lower\r\nincisors were present in uneven number, two on each side and one in the\r\nmiddle. Nothing has been found of the skeleton, but it was doubtless that\r\nof a smaller and somewhat lighter _†Toxodon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 235.—Skull of _†Toxodon_, Pampean formation, the\r\nupper molars much broken. La Plata Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe material from the lower Pliocene adds nothing to our knowledge\r\nof this suborder, but in the Santa Cruz time of Patagonia, which was\r\nMiocene, it was very abundantly represented and preponderatingly by\r\nthe genus _†Nesodon_, which was the first discovered member of the\r\nmarvellous Santa Cruz fauna, named nearly 70 years ago by Sir Richard\r\nOwen. It also chanced that Owen’s specimen was the imperfect lower jaw\r\nof a young animal with the milk-teeth, which were mistaken for the\r\npermanent dentition, and when the latter was found long afterwards, it\r\nwas naturally supposed to belong to a different animal and received a\r\ndifferent generic name. Nor was this all; the changes which took place\r\nin the appearance and relative size of the permanent teeth within the\r\nlife-time of the individual were so remarkable, that the successive\r\nstages of development were by several investigators supposed to be\r\ndistinct genera and species and named accordingly. In this way nearly 30\r\ndifferent names have, at one time or another, been assigned to the common\r\nspecies, _†N. imbricatus_; and it was not until the late Dr. Ameghino had\r\nbrought together a complete series of skulls and jaws illustrating these\r\nchanges, and showing the gradual transition from one to the other, that\r\nthe confusion could be cleared up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 236.—Skull of Santa Cruz †toxodont, _†Nesodon_; same\r\nscale of reduction as Fig. 235.]\r\n\r\nThere was a long hiatus in time between _†Toxodon_ and _†Nesodon_ and\r\nso great was the structural difference between them, that there is much\r\ndoubt whether the latter was directly ancestral to the former; in any\r\nevent, _†Nesodon_ so nearly represents what the desired ancestor must\r\nhave been, as to serve for all practical purposes of the study.\r\n\r\nAll the species of this Santa Cruz genus were much smaller animals than\r\nthe species of _†Toxodon_, _†N. imbricatus_ being no longer than a tapir,\r\nwith considerably shorter legs, and of much slighter and more slender\r\nbuild than _†Toxodon_, though every tooth and every bone proclaims its\r\nrelationship to the latter.\r\n\r\nIn _†Nesodon_ the dental formula was unreduced; _i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_\r\n4/4, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 44, though several of the teeth were much reduced\r\nin size, so as to have lost their functional importance, and frequently\r\nindividuals are found in which one or more of these insignificant teeth\r\nare lacking. The first upper incisor was a broad, chisel-shaped tooth,\r\nwhich continued to grow for a period, then formed its root, and growth\r\nceased; the second incisor was a pointed, triangular tusk, which grew\r\nthroughout life, becoming longer with advancing age; while the third,\r\nwhich was lost in _†Toxodon_, was small and unimportant. In the lower\r\njaw the first and second incisors were chisel-like and had a limited\r\ngrowth; being rather narrow, they both bit against the broad first upper\r\nincisor; the third incisor was a persistently growing tusk, not so large\r\nas the upper one, against the posterior face of which it impinged and was\r\nobliquely truncated by wear, so that its length was limited, while the\r\nupper tusk continued to elongate and was made narrower and sharper by\r\nwear. All the lower incisors were far less procumbent than in _†Toxodon_,\r\nand were directed obliquely upward and forward. The remarkable changes\r\nof appearance which, as mentioned above, took place within the life-time\r\nof the individual, were largely due to the differential growth of the\r\nincisors. The milk-incisors were all nearly alike and formed no tusks;\r\nwhen the permanent incisors were first protruded, the first upper and\r\nthe first and second lower were large and the tusks were not visible,\r\nand, when the latter did appear, they were for some time smaller than the\r\nother incisors. These, however, formed roots and ceased to grow, actually\r\nbecoming smaller with advancing age, for the crowns narrowed to the roots\r\nand, the more they were worn down, the smaller they became. The tusks,\r\non the other hand, grew throughout life and became larger as the other\r\nincisors were reduced by wear, and thus the whole appearance of the\r\nanterior part of the jaw was totally changed.\r\n\r\nThis mode of forming the tusks by the enlargement of the second upper and\r\nthird lower incisor is an unusual one, though it was repeated in another\r\nSouth American ungulate order, the †Litopterna, and nearly so in the\r\nProboscidea, in which both upper and lower tusks were the second of the\r\nthree original incisors.\r\n\r\nIn both jaws, the canines of _†Nesodon_ were insignificant and sometimes\r\nabsent. The premolars, which were smaller and simpler than the molars,\r\nhad quite high crowns, but early ceased to grow and formed long roots.\r\nThe molars were truly hypsodont and formed no roots till late in life;\r\nthey were constructed on the same plan as those of _†Toxodon_, but were\r\ndecidedly more complex, the upper ones having several spurs and crests\r\ngiven off inward from the external wall, in addition to the two principal\r\ntransverse crests, and they had a certain superficial likeness to the\r\nteeth of a rhinoceros. As in _†Toxodon_, these upper molars were curved\r\ninward, so as almost to meet those of the opposite side above the palate.\r\nThe lower molars had the same bicrescentic plan as in _†Toxodon_, but\r\nwere more complicated, and in the concavity of the hinder crescent was a\r\nvertical pillar, which was well-nigh universal among the indigenous South\r\nAmerican ungulates.\r\n\r\nIf _†Nesodon_ was really the ancestor of _†Toxodon_, then the development\r\nof the grinding teeth must have been a process of completing the\r\nhypsodontism, until the teeth grew persistently, never forming roots,\r\nand, at the same time, of simplifying the pattern. This is contrary to\r\nthe usual course of evolution, in which the pattern grew more complex in\r\nthe successive stages; but such steadily increasing complexity was not\r\ninvariable, and several instances of undoubted simplification are known\r\namong mammals, though not yet in other ungulates. Only the recovery of\r\nthe intermediate genera will enable us to determine whether _†Nesodon_\r\nwas the actual ancestor of _†Toxodon_, or whether it was merely one of a\r\nshort-lived branch from the main stem, in which the teeth had acquired an\r\nunusual degree of complexity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 237.—_†Nesodon imbricatus_, Santa Cruz stage.\r\nRestored by C. Knight from a skeleton in the museum of Princeton\r\nUniversity.]\r\n\r\nA few years ago Dr. Ameghino announced the very surprising discovery\r\nthat, instead of having merely the normal arrangement of two dentitions,\r\nthe milk and the permanent, _†Nesodon_ developed three successive\r\ndentitions, one preceding the milk-series, and therefore called\r\n_pre-lacteal_. In certain other mammals traces of a pre-lacteal series\r\nhad already been found, in the shape of tooth-germs, which never attain\r\nfull development or even cut the gum; and quite recently Dr. Ameghino has\r\nshown that in the tapir at least one functional pre-lacteal premolar is\r\nformed. The significance of this fully developed pre-lacteal dentition in\r\n_†Nesodon_ is not yet clear, though it seems reasonable to suppose that\r\nit was the almost uniquely late retention of a primitive character.\r\n\r\nThe skull was closely similar to that of _†Toxodon_, on a smaller\r\nscale, but there were several minor differences, which were, in part,\r\nconditioned by the larger and much more completely hypsodont teeth of\r\nthe Pampean genus, as well as by its generally increased size and bulk.\r\nIn _†Nesodon_ the sagittal and occipital crests were much more prominent\r\nand the former was much longer, while the thickening of the cranial bones\r\nwas in only an incipient stage. The nasal bones were considerably longer.\r\nThe jaws were lower and shallower, in correlation with the less perfectly\r\nhypsodont teeth, and in the lower jaw the chin was much more erect and\r\nrounded. The entire head of this curious Santa Cruz animal had something\r\nremarkably rodent-like in its appearance, though it is quite inadmissible\r\nto suppose that the likeness was due to relationship.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton was far smaller and lighter and otherwise differently\r\nproportioned from that of _†Toxodon_, but there was, nevertheless, a\r\nclose agreement between the two genera. The neck was of moderate length\r\nand thickness, the body long and heavy, but with no such relative bulk\r\nas in the Pampean genus. The hump at the shoulders, as indicated by the\r\nspines of the anterior dorsal vertebræ, though already well defined,\r\nwas less prominent. The shoulder-blade (scapula) was relatively broader\r\nthan in _†Toxodon_, its spine had a distinct acromion and two very long\r\nand conspicuous processes given off backward from the spine, only one of\r\nwhich, and that a mere vestige, is indicated in _†Toxodon_. The hip-bones\r\nwere almost parallel with the backbone and were not nearly so broad or so\r\neverted as in the latter, a difference which is amply accounted for by\r\nthe great discrepancy in girth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 238.—Left pes of _†Toxodon_. La Plata Museum.\r\n_Cal._, calcaneum. _As._, astragalus. _N._, navicular. _Cn. 1_ and _2_,\r\ncoössified internal and middle cuneiforms. _Cn. 3_, external cuneiform.\r\n_Cb._, cuboid.]\r\n\r\nThe limbs were of nearly equal length and there was no such shortening\r\nof the fore-arm or elongation of the thigh as in _†Toxodon_, and so the\r\ndescent of the backbone forward, which gave such grotesqueness to the\r\nskeleton of the latter, was far less pronounced. The limb-bones were\r\nrather slender, in size and proportions not unlike those of a tapir,\r\nbut in structure very like the very much larger and more massive ones\r\nof _†Toxodon_. The bones of the fore-arm were separate, but those of\r\nthe lower leg were coössified in the same exceptional manner as in\r\nthe Pampean genus, that is, the upper ends, but not the lower, were\r\nfused together. The thigh-bone was not flattened, but had the normal\r\ncylindrical shaft and a conspicuous third trochanter. The feet, in which\r\nthe digits were already reduced to three, were extremely small in\r\ncomparison with the size of the animal; in structure, they were almost\r\nidentical with those of _†Toxodon_, but were far narrower and more\r\nslender. The heel-bone (calcaneum) articulated with the other bones of\r\nthe tarsus in a normal manner. The digits were well separated and the\r\nhoof-bones quite strongly developed, indicating that the hoofs were\r\nfunctional, supporting most of the weight. In short, the difference in\r\nthe external appearance of the feet between the two genera was much the\r\nsame as between the tapirs and rhinoceroses.\r\n\r\nThe species of _†Nesodon_, of which many have been named on very\r\nquestionable grounds, differed but little in size and were of such\r\nvariable and fluctuating character that a proper discrimination of them\r\nis exceedingly difficult. One of these species (_†N. cornutus_) gives\r\nindications of having possessed a small dermal horn on the forehead and\r\nwas thus a possible ancestor of _†Trigodon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 239.—Left pes of _†Nesodon_, Princeton University\r\nMuseum. Letters as in Fig. 238 and scale of reduction the same.]\r\n\r\nA second phylum of the suborder was represented in the Santa Cruz stage\r\nby the genus _†Adinotherium_, the species of which, not equalling a\r\nsheep in size, were very much smaller animals than those of _†Nesodon_,\r\nbut closely like them in other respects. The dentition, including the\r\npre-lacteal series, and the skull were almost identical in the two\r\ngenera, with the exception that a large proportion of the individuals\r\nof _†Adinotherium_ had the small frontal horn, while others had no\r\ntrace of it. While it is quite possible that the presence or absence\r\nof the horn, which was always inconspicuous, may have been a matter of\r\nspecific distinction, a more probable explanation is that it was a sexual\r\ncharacter, the males horned and the females hornless. Much the same thing\r\nis to be observed in the modern Javan Rhinoceros (_R. sondaicus_) in\r\nwhich the females have a very small horn, or none at all, and the males a\r\nlarge one.\r\n\r\nIn the skeleton also there were few differences, other than those of\r\nsize, between _†Adinotherium_ and _†Nesodon_; the former was not only\r\nsmaller, but also lighter and more slender proportionately, and there\r\nwas no hump at the shoulders, the spines of the dorsal and lumbar\r\nvertebræ all reaching the same level, so that the back must have been\r\nnearly straight in the living animal. From the more general and constant\r\npresence of the frontal horn, _†Adinotherium_ was more probably the\r\nancestor of the horned _†Trigodon_ than was _†Nesodon_, but until the\r\nintermediate forms shall have been recovered, no definite decision can be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 240.—_†Adinotherium ovinum_, small, horned †toxodont\r\nof the Santa Cruz. Restored from a skeleton in the museum of Princeton\r\nUniversity.—Note the minute horn on the forehead.]\r\n\r\nThe same or very nearly the same genera of the family †Toxodontidæ lived\r\nin the Patagonian and Deseado stages, but there the record breaks off\r\nand can, for the present at least, be followed no farther. It remains to\r\nbe determined whether the series originated in regions farther to the\r\nnorth, or whether the ancestral types will be found in Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe other two families are still very incompletely known, but\r\nsufficiently to justify their inclusion in the present suborder. In the\r\n†Leontiniidæ, which are known only from the Deseado stage (_†Leontinia_),\r\nwe have a curious variant of the †toxodont type. The tusks were decidedly\r\nsmaller than in the Santa Cruz members of the preceding family, the\r\ngrinding teeth with lower crowns and simpler structure. The skull was\r\nmuch like that of _†Nesodon_, but the anterior nasal opening was of quite\r\na different shape, being carried much farther back on the sides, so that\r\nthe nasal bones had a far longer portion which was freely projecting and\r\nunsupported; these bones were shorter and much thicker than in the Santa\r\nCruz genera and, to all appearances, supported a small, median horn on\r\ntheir anterior ends. The feet, so far as they have been recovered, did\r\nnot differ in any significant manner from those of the preceding family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 241.—Skull of _Adinotherium_, top-view, showing the\r\nrugosity on the forehead for the small frontal horn.—Princeton University\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nAnother imperfectly known family, that of the †Notohippidæ, occurred in\r\nthe Patagonian stage, but was most abundant in the Deseado, where several\r\ngenera of it have been found. These animals had mostly hypsodont teeth,\r\nforming roots in old age, and the teeth were in closed series, but there\r\nwas no tusk-like enlargement of the incisors. In the later genera, those\r\nof the Patagonian stage (_†Notohippus_, _†Argyrohippus_), the crowns of\r\nthe grinding teeth had a thick covering of cement, and those of the lower\r\njaw had some resemblance, though not at all a close one, to the teeth of\r\nhorses. The skull also had a certain suggestion of likeness to the horses\r\nand Dr. Ameghino was persuaded that these animals were ancestors of the\r\nhorses. The family went back to the Astraponotus stage, but can be traced\r\nno farther.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER †TYPOTHERIA. †TYPOTHERES\r\n\r\nThis suborder was composed of much smaller animals than the †Toxodonta\r\nand contained no large forms; some, indeed, were exceedingly small, no\r\nlarger than rabbits. It was much the most diversified of the suborders,\r\nas is made evident by the table of families and genera. Two of these\r\nfamilies, the †Typotheriidæ and the †Hegetotheriidæ, continued into the\r\nolder Pleistocene. Of the former there was the genus first named and\r\ndescribed, _†Typotherium_, which has given its name to the family and\r\nsuborder, and the species of which were much the largest of the entire\r\ngroup, almost equalling a large pig in size. At the first glance this\r\ngenus might easily be mistaken for a large rodent, and indeed it has\r\nactually been referred to that order, but the resemblance was a purely\r\nsuperficial one and involved no relationship.\r\n\r\nIn _†Typotherium_ the teeth were considerably reduced in number, the\r\nformula being: _i_ 1/2, _c_ 0/0, _p_ 2/1, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 24. The first\r\nincisor in each jaw was a broad, scalpriform, persistently growing tooth,\r\nwhich much resembled the corresponding tooth in the rodents, but was not,\r\nas it is in the latter, worn to a sharp chisel-edge by attrition, but was\r\nabruptly truncated. There was a second similar, but much smaller, tooth\r\nin the lower jaw; the other incisors and all the canines had been lost\r\nand the premolars reduced to two in the upper and one in the lower jaw.\r\nThe molars were large, persistently growing and thoroughly hypsodont; in\r\npattern they were very similar to those of _†Toxodon_. The skull without\r\nthe lower jaw was low and the cranial portion broad and flattened,\r\nbut retaining a long sagittal crest. The eye-sockets were nearly, but\r\nnot quite, closed behind by the very long and slender postorbital\r\nprocesses of the frontal bones. In front of the eyes the face was\r\nsuddenly constricted into a long, narrow rostrum, and it is this shape\r\nof the skull which, together with the persistently growing, scalpriform\r\nincisors, gave such a rodent-like appearance to the head. The auditory\r\nregion had the same remarkable structure as in the †Toxodonta. The lower\r\njaw had a short horizontal portion and very high vertical portion, which\r\ngave the head great vertical depth.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton, so far as it is known, was decidedly more primitive than\r\nthat of the contemporary _†Toxodon_, as is shown by the presence of\r\ncollar-bones (clavicles) and by the larger number of digits, five in the\r\nfront foot and four in the hind. The hoof-bones, or ungual phalanges,\r\nwere narrow, pointed and nail-like, though in the hind foot they were\r\nbroader and more hoof-like.\r\n\r\nLittle can be done as yet in tracing back the history of this family, the\r\nSanta Cruz beds having yielded no member of it. In the Deseado stage, the\r\ngenus _†Eutrachytherus_ differed surprisingly little from _†Typotherium_,\r\nin view of the long hiatus in time between them. The Deseado genus\r\nalready had thoroughly hypsodont and rootless teeth, and the molar\r\npattern was quite the same as in _†Typotherium_, but the teeth were much\r\nmore numerous, the formula being: _i_ 3/2, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 4/4, _m_ 3/3,\r\n× 2 = 42. Nothing is known of the skeleton. The family arose probably\r\nfrom one of the Eocene families (†Archæopithecidæ or †Acœlodidæ) with\r\nlow-crowned teeth, but the connection cannot be made out. Presumably, the\r\ndevelopment of this family ran its chief course in some part of South\r\nAmerica far to the north of the fossil-beds of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe second family which was represented in Pampean times was that of the\r\n†Hegetotheriidæ, and the sole genus of it which survived so late was\r\n_†Pachyrukhos_, a little creature no larger than a rabbit. The genus\r\nwent back without any noteworthy change to the Santa Cruz stage of the\r\nMiocene, from which complete skeletons have been obtained. The dental\r\nformula was nearly as in _†Typotherium_: _i_ 1/2, _c_ 0/0, _p_ 3/3, _m_\r\n3/3, × 2 = 30, and the enlarged, rootless and scalpriform incisors were\r\nsimilar. The grinding teeth were thoroughly hypsodont and had a thin\r\ncoating of cement; the molar-pattern was fundamentally like that of\r\n_†Nesodon_, in simpler form, but can be seen only in freshly erupted and\r\nunworn teeth.\r\n\r\nThe skull was very rodent-like in appearance, its flat top and narrow,\r\ntapering facial region, and the gnawing incisors adding much to the\r\nresemblance. The very large eye-sockets and the enormously developed\r\nauditory region suggest nocturnal habits, and, no doubt, the timid,\r\ndefenceless little creatures hid themselves by day, perhaps in burrows.\r\nThe enlargement of the accessory auditory chambers, which all of the\r\n†Toxodontia possessed, reached its maximum in _†Pachyrukhos_, and the\r\nchambers formed great, inflated protuberances at the postero-external\r\nangles of the skull. The neck was short, the body long and the tail very\r\nshort, much like that of a rabbit. Collar-bones were present, as they\r\nprobably were in all of the other members of the suborder †Typotheria,\r\nthough this has not been definitely ascertained in all cases. The limbs\r\nwere relatively long, especially the hind legs, and very slender; the\r\nbones of the fore-arm were separate, but those of the lower leg were\r\ncoössified at both ends. The feet, which had four digits each, were of\r\nunequal size, the posterior pair being much longer than the anterior,\r\nand the hoofs were long, slender and pointed, almost claw-like. The\r\nentire skeleton suggests a leaping gait and its proportions and general\r\nappearance were remarkably like those of a rabbit-skeleton. In the\r\nrestoration (Fig. 300, p. 639) Mr. Knight has followed these indications\r\nand drawn an animal which might readily be mistaken for a curious,\r\nshort-eared rabbit; and there is every justification for doing this,\r\nthough the character of the fur and the form of the ears are, of course,\r\nmerely conjectural. Perhaps the ears are too small.\r\n\r\nAssociated with _†Pachyrukhos_ in the Santa Cruz stage was another\r\ngenus of the family, _†Hegetotherium_, which, though it cannot possibly\r\nhave been ancestral to the former, yet serves to indicate, in general\r\nterms, what the ancestor must have been. This is another example of\r\nthe long-continued survival of the more primitive together with the\r\nmore advanced and specialized form. _†Hegetotherium_ persisted into the\r\nPliocene, but is not known from the Pleistocene. In this genus one upper\r\nand two lower incisors were already enlarged, rootless and scalpriform,\r\nbut none of the teeth had been lost; it is interesting to note, however,\r\nthat the teeth which were lacking in _†Pachyrukhos_ were all very small\r\nand ready to disappear. The Santa Cruz species of _†Hegetotherium_ were\r\nconsiderably larger and more robust animals than those of _†Pachyrukhos_.\r\n\r\nBoth of these genera were preceded by very similar, almost identical\r\nforms in the Patagonian, Deseado and Astraponotus stages, but the family\r\ncannot be definitely traced farther back than the lower Oligocene, but it\r\nvery probably arose from some one of the groups, with low-crowned teeth,\r\nof the Casa Mayor stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 242.—Santa Cruz †typothere (_†Protypotherium\r\naustrale_) and armadillo (_†Stegotherium tesselatum_). Restored by C.\r\nKnight from skeletons in the museum of Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nThe family †Interatheriidæ was, in most respects, more conservative and\r\nunderwent less change than either of the preceding groups. A persistently\r\nprimitive type was the genus _†Protypotherium_, which appeared for the\r\nlast time in the Pliocene of Monte Hermoso, but was much more abundant\r\nand better preserved in the Santa Cruz. The animal was small and had the\r\nfull complement of teeth, which were arranged in each jaw in a continuous\r\nseries, and were fully hypsodont and rootless, except incisors and\r\ncanine, which were rooted. None of the incisors was specially enlarged,\r\nbut there was a gradual transition of increasing size and complexity from\r\nthe incisors to the molars. A remarkable feature of this genus was the\r\ndeeply cleft form of the lower incisors, giving them a fork-like shape,\r\nsomewhat as in the modern Hyracoidea. The ulna and radius in the fore-arm\r\nand the tibia and fibula in the lower leg were separate, but the digits\r\nwere already reduced to four in each foot. This was one of the few Santa\r\nCruz ungulates which possessed a long and heavy tail. The limbs were\r\nrelatively long and the feet were armed with such slender hoofs that they\r\nlooked almost like claws. The restoration shows the animal to have had,\r\nlike nearly all of the †Typotheria, a very rodent-like appearance, a\r\nlikeness which may, perhaps, be unduly increased by the form given to the\r\nears.\r\n\r\nIn the allied genus, _†Interatherium_, from which the family is named,\r\nthe head was short, broad and deep, almost bullet-like; the first incisor\r\nwas enlarged and chisel-shaped, and the other incisors and the canines\r\nwere much reduced in size. It is an interesting fact, observed as yet\r\nonly in this genus, but probably true also of all the smaller members\r\nof the suborder which had hypsodont teeth, that the milk-premolars were\r\nrooted and comparatively low-crowned, while their permanent successors\r\nwere completely hypsodont and rootless. The limbs were considerably\r\nshorter than those of _†Protypotherium_ and the tail long and thick,\r\nexcept for which, the general appearance of the skeleton suggests that\r\nof the modern “conies” or “klipdases” (Hyracoidea) of Africa and Syria,\r\na suggestion which Mr. Knight has followed in the drawing (Fig. 297, p.\r\n636).\r\n\r\nThis family was represented in the Deseado stage by a genus\r\n(_†Plagiarthrus_) in which the teeth developed roots in old age, but is\r\nnot known from more ancient formations. Their probable ancestors of the\r\nEocene were very small animals, with brachyodont teeth, the premolars\r\nsmaller and of simpler pattern than the molars. The upper molars had\r\na continuous external wall, with indication of separate cusps, and\r\ntwo transverse crests, as in the †Toxodonta, and the lower molars\r\nwere composed of two incomplete crescents. The teeth were present in\r\nundiminished number and the anterior incisors were but little enlarged.\r\nNothing is known of the skeleton.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER †ENTELONYCHIA. †HOMALODOTHERES\r\n\r\nThis third suborder of the †Toxodontia was in some respects the most\r\npeculiar of all; no representatives of it have been found in formations\r\nlater than the Santa Cruz, and the group attained its culmination in the\r\nstill older Deseado stage, in which there were very large members of it.\r\nThese most extraordinary beasts are still incompletely known, and little\r\ncan be done as yet in the way of following out the steps of change which\r\nled up to their exceptional characters, though the suborder itself may be\r\ntraced back to the Eocene by means of jaws and teeth alone.\r\n\r\nThe Santa Cruz genus labours under the portentous name of\r\n_†Homalodontotherium_, which may be shortened to the vernacular form of\r\n†homalodothere. In this genus the dentition was unreduced in number,\r\nand the teeth, though having rather high crowns, were all rooted and\r\nplaced in continuous series, with a gradual transition in shape from\r\nthe incisors to the molars. The canines were tusks of very moderate\r\nsize, which projected but little above and below the plane of the other\r\nteeth; the premolars, except the last, which was nearly molariform, were\r\nsmaller and simpler than the molars, which had a pattern fundamentally\r\nthe same as in the †Toxodonta. Those of the upper jaw were, however,\r\nless complicated by spurs and accessory crests, and they had a somewhat\r\nstronger resemblance to the rhinoceros pattern, though the resemblance is\r\ndemonstrably superficial and not indicative of relationship.\r\n\r\nThe skull was very like that of the Santa Cruz †toxodonts, _†Nesodon_,\r\netc., and had the same unusual structure of the auditory region as was\r\nfound throughout the order, but differed in many details, which it is\r\nnot worth while to enumerate, though it may be said that the nasal bones\r\nwere so much shortened that some kind of a proboscis or prehensile upper\r\nlip was probably present. The head was quite small in proportion to the\r\nsize of the animal as a whole. Such of the vertebræ as are known were\r\nquite similar to those of _†Nesodon_, but the limbs were far longer and\r\nquite stout, though not massive. The humerus was remarkable for the great\r\ndevelopment of the ridges for the attachment of the deltoid and supinator\r\nmuscles and for the prominence of the epicondyles, all of which gave to\r\nthe bone the appearance of the humerus of a huge burrower, yet it is\r\nimpossible to believe that so large an animal could have had burrowing\r\nhabits. The fore-arm bones were separate and very long, the ulna almost\r\nas heavy as the radius; the latter is not known from a complete specimen,\r\nbut there would appear to have been some power of rotation, a power which\r\nis conditioned by the shape of the upper end of the radius, and its mode\r\nof articulation with the humerus in the elbow-joint. The thigh-bone was\r\nlong and heavy and its shaft was much flattened, having lost the normal\r\ncylindrical shape, but retained a small third trochanter. The bones of\r\nthe lower leg were separate and relatively short, and the fibula was\r\nuncommonly heavy.\r\n\r\nSo far, there was nothing very unusual, save in the shape of the humerus,\r\nabout the skeletal structure of the †Entelonychia, the remarkable\r\ncharacters having been confined to the feet. Were it not for these, the\r\ngroup might be included in the suborder †Toxodonta without difficulty.\r\nThe feet, which were five-toed, differed notably in size, the manus being\r\nmore than twice as long as the pes. In the former the metacarpals were\r\nvery long and, though actually stout, were slender in proportion to their\r\nlength; there was also a very unusual feature in an ungulate foot, that\r\nthe heaviest of the digits was the fifth, or external one. The mode of\r\narticulation of the metacarpals with the first row of phalanges was very\r\nexceptional, indicating an extraordinary mobility of the toes, and the\r\nhoofs had been transformed into large, bluntly pointed claws, somewhat\r\nlike those of the †chalicotheres, those aberrant perissodactyls (see p.\r\n354), but not so large or so sharp. In the pes, the ankle-bone had hardly\r\nany groove for the tibia, and its lower end was hemispherical, as in\r\nthe †Condylarthra and the clawed mammals generally. The toes were quite\r\ngrotesquely short in comparison with those of the fore foot, and, as in\r\nthe latter, the fifth was the heaviest of the series. The hind foot was\r\napparently plantigrade, the heel-bone and the entire sole being applied\r\nto the ground in walking, while the fore foot was probably digitigrade,\r\nthe wrist being raised and the metacarpals vertical. The weight was\r\ncarried upon the metacarpals and one or more pads under the phalanges,\r\nas in the digitigrade carnivores, such as dogs and cats. In describing\r\nthe †chalicotheres, it was pointed out that it was uncertain whether each\r\nfoot had a single large pad, or whether there was a separate one under\r\nthe phalanges of each digit, and a larger one, the “ball of the foot,”\r\nunder the metacarpals collectively. The same doubt applies to the manus\r\nof the †homalodotheres.\r\n\r\nThis is the third instance to be cited of the acquisition of claws by\r\na hoofed mammal and, as in the other two cases, the †chalicotheres and\r\n†agriochœrids (p. 383), we are confronted by the seemingly incompatible\r\nassociation of teeth which could have masticated only soft vegetable\r\ntissues with feet like those of a beast of prey. As in the other\r\ntwo groups, the problem as to the habits and mode of life of the\r\n†homalodotheres is an unsolved one, chiefly because no mammal now living\r\nis at all like these extraordinary creatures and one can therefore form\r\nbut vague conjectures as to the use of such feet to herbivorous animals.\r\nPossibly they subsisted largely upon roots and tubers and used the great\r\nclaws for digging up food, the principal employment that bears now make\r\nof their claws. This remarkable transformation of hoofs into claws\r\ntook place in three unrelated groups of hoofed animals and must have\r\noccurred independently among the Artiodactyla, the Perissodactyla and the\r\n†Toxodontia. By no possibility, so far as we are able to comprehend the\r\ncourse of evolutionary change, could this common characteristic have been\r\ndue to inheritance from a common ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe †homalodotheres were among the largest of Santa Cruz mammals, but\r\nthey were then already approaching extinction, while in the Deseado stage\r\nthey were more numerous and varied and some of them very much larger.\r\nThis is an exception to the more common rule, according to which the\r\nsuccessive members of a phylum increased in stature until the maximum was\r\nreached and this, in many cases, was followed by extinction. The rule is,\r\nhowever, by no means without exceptions and several have already been\r\nreferred to. The largest of American proboscideans was the †Imperial\r\nElephant (_Elephas †imperator_) of the upper Pliocene and Pleistocene\r\nand in many other phyla the Pleistocene species were much larger than\r\nthe Recent. So with the †homalodotheres; they reached their culmination\r\nin size and importance in the Deseado stage, fewer and smaller forms\r\nsurviving into the Santa Cruz, after which the entire suborder vanished.\r\nThe family may be traced back to the Eocene, where it is represented\r\nchiefly by a genus (_†Thomashuxleya_) which had larger canine tusks\r\nand much more brachyodont teeth, but there is no way of determining\r\nwhen the transformation of the hoofs took place. The other two families\r\n(†Notostylopidæ, †Isotemnidæ) flourished chiefly or exclusively in the\r\nEocene and were small animals still very imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER †PYROTHERIA. †PYROTHERES\r\n\r\nThis suborder was a remarkable group, still incompletely known, of\r\nelephant-like animals, which reached their culmination and died out in\r\nthe Oligocene, their last appearance being in the Deseado stage. The\r\ngenus _†Pyrotherium_ from the Deseado (also called the Pyrotherium Beds)\r\nwas the latest, largest and best known of the suborder. The dentition\r\nwas much reduced as is shown by the formula: _i_ 2/1, _c_ 0/0, _p_ 3/2,\r\n_m_ 3/3, × 2 = 28. The upper incisors were two downwardly directed\r\ntusks, the first quite small, the second considerably larger; the single\r\nlower incisor of each side was a stout, but not very long, horizontally\r\ndirected tusk, with the enamel confined to a longitudinal band; the other\r\nincisors and the canines had disappeared. The premolars, except the\r\nforemost one, had the molar-pattern, which very rarely occurred among\r\nthe indigenous South American ungulates. The grinding teeth were similar\r\nabove and below and each had two elevated, transverse crests, which,\r\nwhen quite unworn, carried a row of bead-like tubercles. These teeth\r\nare decidedly reminiscent of the dentition of the aberrant proboscidean\r\n_†Dinotherium_, from the Miocene and Pliocene of Europe (p. 435), and\r\nthis resemblance, together with the form of the tusks, has led to the\r\nreference of this group to the Proboscidea, but the assignment is\r\nundoubtedly erroneous, as is shown by the character of the skull and\r\nskeleton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 243.—Head of _†Pyrotherium_, showing the two pairs of\r\nupper tusks. Restored from a skull in the museum of Amherst College.]\r\n\r\nThe skull, hitherto unknown, was obtained by the Amherst College\r\nExpedition to Patagonia and its description by Professor F. B. Loomis is\r\nanxiously awaited. In advance of that, he has published a brief account,\r\nwith a figure. This skull was long and narrow, with very short facial\r\nregion and nasal bones so shortened that the nasal canal passed almost\r\nvertically down through the head, as in the elephants, and there must\r\nhave been a considerable proboscis. Despite this great modification, the\r\nskull was plainly of the †toxodont and not of the proboscidean type.\r\nThe legs were extremely massive and the fore legs were considerably\r\nshorter than the hind, with such a difference in length that the head\r\nmust have been carried low, as in the Pampean _†Toxodon_. The upper arm\r\nand thigh were much longer than the fore-arm and lower leg respectively.\r\nThe humerus was immensely broadened, especially the lower end, and\r\nthe processes for muscular attachment were extremely prominent. The\r\nfemur was long, with broad and flattened shaft, and had no trace of\r\nthe third trochanter, quite strongly resembling the thigh-bone of an\r\nelephant, which, as we have repeatedly seen, is the type more or less\r\nclosely approximated by all of the very heavy ungulates. In the standing\r\nposition, the femur was in nearly the same vertical line as the tibia\r\nand the whole leg must have been almost perfectly straight, with the\r\nknee-joint free from the body. The short and massive fore-arm bones were\r\ncoössified, at least in some individuals, as were the equally heavy bones\r\nof the lower leg, the fibula being exceptionally stout. Little is known\r\nof the feet, but that little renders probable the inference that they\r\nwere short, columnar and five-toed.\r\n\r\nThe Eocene representatives of the Pyrotheria are known only from very\r\nfragmentary material. _†Propyrotherium_, of the Astraponotus Beds, was\r\nsmaller than the Deseado genus and still smaller was _†Carolozittellia_\r\nof the Casa Mayor, which was not so large as a tapir. In the latter the\r\nmolars were of the same type as in the succeeding forms and small tusks\r\nhad already begun to develop. The older Eocene genus _†Paulogervaisia_\r\nwas probably a member of this suborder; if so, it shows that the molars\r\nwith transverse crests were derived from quadritubercular teeth, just as\r\nhappened in the Proboscidea and several other ungulate groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE †LITOPTERNA AND †ASTRAPOTHERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the four well-defined groups which make up the †Toxodontia (or\r\n†Notoungulata) there are two other extinct orders of indigenous South\r\nAmerican ungulates, which remain to be considered. These did not have\r\nthe exceptional development of the auditory region of the skull which\r\ncharacterized the †Toxodontia. The best known and most important genera\r\nof the †Litopterna are listed in the following table:\r\n\r\n  †LITOPTERNA. †Litopterns\r\n\r\n    I. †MACRAUCHENIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Macrauchenia_, Plioc. and Pleist.\r\n        _†Scalibrinitherium_, Paraná. _†Theosodon_, Santa\r\n        Cruz. _†Cramauchenia_, Patagonian. _†Protheosodon_,\r\n        Deseado.\r\n\r\n    II.

DIDOLODIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Didolodus_, Casa Mayor. _†Lambdaconus_, do.\r\n        _†Notoprogonia_, do. _†Proectocion_, do., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nOnly one of the families of this suborder survived into the Pampean\r\nstage, where it was represented by a single genus, _†Macrauchenia_. Like\r\nall the other large Pampean mammals of distinctly South American type,\r\nthis was a grotesque creature, from the modern point of view. The genus\r\nwas first discovered by Darwin, who says of it: “At Port St. Julian, in\r\nsome red mud capping the gravel on the 90-foot plain, I found half the\r\nskeleton of the Macrauchenia Patachonica, a remarkable quadruped, full as\r\nlarge as a camel. It belongs to the same division of the Pachydermata\r\nwith the rhinoceros, tapir, and palæotherium; but in the structure of\r\nthe bones of its long neck it shows a clear relation to the camel, or\r\nrather to the guanaco and llama.”[12] The views upon classification and\r\nrelationship here expressed have been superseded, but the passage is an\r\nimportant one in the history of scientific opinion.\r\n\r\n_†Macrauchenia_ (Fig. 120, p. 216), as Darwin says, was as large as\r\na camel; it had an unreduced dentition of 44 teeth and in each jaw\r\nthe teeth were arranged in continuous series and were quite decidedly\r\nhypsodont. Both in the upper and the lower jaws the incisors formed\r\na nearly straight transverse row and have a “mark,” or enamel pit,\r\nlike that seen in the horses; the canines were but little larger than\r\nthe incisors and did not form tusks. The premolars were smaller and\r\nsimpler than the molars. The upper molars had two concave and crescentic\r\nexternal cusps, connected by a median ridge, as in several families of\r\nperissodactyls; two transverse crests and several accessory spurs and\r\nenamel-pockets gave to the grinding surface, when somewhat worn, the\r\nappearance of considerable complexity. The lower molars had the two\r\ncrescents, one behind the other, which recurred in almost all the South\r\nAmerican types of ungulates; the vertical pillar which so generally in\r\nthese types arose in the inner concavity of the posterior crescent was\r\nwanting in the permanent teeth of _†Macrauchenia_, but present in the\r\nmilk-premolars.\r\n\r\nNo part of this remarkable animal was more curious than the skull, which\r\nwas quite small in proportion to the rest of the skeleton. It was long,\r\nnarrow and low, sloping and tapering forward to a blunt point at the end\r\nof the muzzle, though there was a slight broadening here to accommodate\r\nthe transverse row of incisors. The sagittal crest was replaced by a\r\nshort, narrow and flat area; the cranium was shortened and the face\r\nelongated, the orbits, which were completely encircled in bone, having\r\nbeen shifted behind the line of the teeth, as in the modern horses.\r\nThe nasal bones were reduced to a minimum, a mere vestige of their\r\noriginal length, the anterior nasal opening being directly over the\r\nposterior, making the nasal passage vertical. Such an arrangement is an\r\nalmost positive proof that in life the animal had a flexible proboscis,\r\na conclusion which is confirmed by the presence, on the top of the\r\nhead and behind the nasal opening, of deep pits for the attachment of\r\nthe proboscis-muscles. A very curious feature of this skull was that\r\nthe bones of the upper jaw, the maxillaries and premaxillaries of the\r\nopposite sides, united in the median line, making a long, solid, bony\r\nrostrum in front of the nasal opening, a character not found in other\r\nland mammals.\r\n\r\nThe neck was almost as long as in a camel and its vertebræ agreed with\r\nthose of the latter in the very exceptional character of having the canal\r\nfor the vertebral artery passing longitudinally through the neural arch,\r\ninstead of perforating the transverse process. As Darwin says in the\r\npassage quoted above, “it shows a clear relation to the ... guanaco and\r\nllama,” but this is founded on the postulate that such a likeness must,\r\nof necessity, imply relationship. As was shown in the chapters on the\r\nArtiodactyla and Perissodactyla, it is the general rule among long-necked\r\nungulates that the odontoid process of the axis assumes a spout-like\r\nshape, but _†Macrauchenia_ was an exception and had an odontoid which\r\nretained its primitive and peg-like shape; it was, however, relatively\r\nvery short and in cross-section was no longer circular, but oval. This\r\nmay be regarded as a step toward the assumption of the spout-like form,\r\nbut the extinction of the family put an end to further changes in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe body was rather short and the limbs very long, giving the animal\r\na stilted appearance, while the feet were relatively short. The\r\nproportionate lengths of the different limb-segments was unusual; the\r\nupper arm was short, the fore-arm very long, the thigh long and the\r\nlower leg quite short. The humerus was very heavy; the ulna and radius,\r\nwhich were firmly coössified, formed a very long compound bone, which\r\nwas broad transversely and thin antero-posteriorly. The long femur had\r\nonly a small and inconspicuous third trochanter and the shaft was broad\r\nand thin, being flattened, or “compressed” antero-posteriorly. The\r\ntibia and fibula were united at both ends; the former was very heavy at\r\nthe upper end, but diminished downward in width and thickness, and the\r\nfibula articulated with the calcaneum, as in the artiodactyls. The feet\r\nwere tridactyl and had mesaxonic symmetry; that is to say, the median\r\ndigit, or third of the original five, was symmetrical in itself and was\r\nbisected by the middle line of the foot, while the lateral toes (second\r\nand fourth), each of which was asymmetrical, formed a symmetrical pair.\r\nIt is this perissodactyl character of the foot to which Darwin refers\r\nwhen he says that _†Macrauchenia_ “belongs to the same division of the\r\nPachydermata with the rhinoceros, tapir and palæotherium.” On the other\r\nhand, the very significant structure of the ankle-joint was radically\r\ndifferent from that of the Perissodactyla; not only did the calcaneum\r\nhave a special facet for articulation with the fibula, but the lower end\r\nof the astragalus was a convex “head,” resting only on the navicular, as\r\nin the †Toxodontia, †Condylarthra, Hyracoidea and other very primitive\r\ngroups of hoofed animals and in clawed mammals generally. Such a\r\ncombination of characters is not known in any of the perissodactyls and\r\nprecludes the reference of the †Litopterna to that order, though such\r\na reference is strongly maintained by several authorities. The ungual\r\nphalanges were small and appear to suggest the presence of pads on the\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of _†Macrauchenia_ in life must have been sufficiently\r\nstrange. The small head with its proboscis and the long neck and legs\r\nshould probably be regarded as indicative of browsing habits, though\r\nthe hypsodont teeth show that grazing was at least an occasional mode\r\nof feeding. The long limbs and short feet gave to the extremities an\r\nappearance unlike that of any existing hoofed animal. The form and\r\nsize of the ears and the character of the hairy coat are, of course,\r\nconjectural.\r\n\r\nIn the later Pliocene the family was represented by forms which differed\r\nso little from the Pampean _†Macrauchenia_ as to call for no particular\r\nnotice, but in the presumably lower Pliocene of the Paraná stage,\r\noccurred several genera, all unfortunately but imperfectly known, which\r\nare of interest as being less specialized than _†Macrauchenia_ and as\r\nshowing the way in which some of the peculiarities of the latter were\r\nacquired. In _†Scalibrinitherium_, which may be taken as an example of\r\nthese genera, the teeth were brachyodont; the upper molars were rather\r\nless complex than those of _†Macrauchenia_, while the lower molars\r\nhad the pillar in the concavity of the posterior crescent, which the\r\nPampean genus retained only in the milk-teeth. As we have repeatedly\r\nfound, the milk-dentition is often conservative and retains primitive\r\nor archaic features which have been lost in the permanent teeth, and\r\n_†Macrauchenia_ is another illustration of the same principle. In the\r\nskull of _†Scalibrinitherium_ the nasal bones, though very short, had not\r\nsuffered such extreme abbreviation as in the succeeding genus, the nasal\r\nopening was farther forward and the maxillaries united in the superior\r\nmedian line for only a short distance, while the premaxillaries were\r\nfused together for their whole length. The orbit had not been shifted\r\nentirely behind the teeth, but was above the third upper molar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 244.—Santa Cruz †macrauchenid (_†Theosodon\r\ngarrettorum_) and predaceous marsupial (_†Borhyæna tuberata_). Restored\r\nby C. Knight from skeletons in the museum of Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nNext in the ascending series, to use the genealogist’s term, came\r\nthe genus _†Theosodon_ of the Santa Cruz, of which almost all the\r\nskeletal parts are known and thus make possible a full comparison with\r\n_†Macrauchenia_, which assuredly was its direct descendant. In view\r\nof the great lapse of time involved, the differences between the two\r\ngenera were less than might have been expected, though the more ancient\r\nanimal was in all respects the more primitive. _†Theosodon_ was, in the\r\nfirst place, considerably smaller, not much exceeding a llama in size;\r\nthe teeth had lower crowns than even those of _†Scalibrinitherium_ and\r\nthe incisors were arranged in line with the grinding teeth, not in\r\na transverse row, but curving inward slightly, so that those of the\r\nopposite sides nearly met in front. The incisors, canine and first\r\npremolar were simple, sharply pointed, conical teeth, which gave an\r\nalmost reptilian expression to the anterior part of the skull. The upper\r\nmolars were on the same fundamental plan as those of _†Macrauchenia_,\r\nbut in a less advanced stage of development, the transverse crests being\r\nincomplete and the internal cusps had a certain degree of separateness\r\nfrom the crests and from each other. It is evident that the upper\r\nmolars were derived from the quadritubercular type. The lower molars\r\nhad the vertical pillar in the concavity of the posterior crescent very\r\nprominently developed.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of the skull to that of _†Macrauchenia_ is obvious at\r\nthe first glance, but it was less specialized and departed less from the\r\nordinary ungulate type. The cranium was longer and the face shorter, the\r\norbit, which was incompletely closed behind, extending over the second\r\nmolar. There was a sagittal crest, the length of which differed much in\r\nthe various species; the nasal bones were already very short, though\r\ndecidedly longer than in the subsequent genus _†Scalibrinitherium_, and\r\nthe anterior nasal opening was extended forward as a long, narrow slit,\r\nbecause the maxillaries did not come into contact with each other in the\r\nsuperior median line, and the premaxillaries touched each other, but were\r\nnot coössified. The nasal canal, though very short, was horizontal, not\r\nvertical. The skulls of the three genera thus displayed three successive\r\nstages in the backward shifting of the orbit and of the anterior nasal\r\nopening, in the shortening of the nasal bones and in the formation of a\r\nsolid rostrum by the fusion of the upper jaw-bones. No doubt also the\r\nliving animals exhibited a corresponding gradation in the development of\r\nthe proboscis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 245.—Development of the skull in the †Macrauchenidæ,\r\nside views. _A_, _†Theosodon_, Santa Cruz. _B_, _†Scalibrinitherium_,\r\nParaná.

(After Ameghino.) _C_,\r\n_†Macrauchenia_. (After Burmeister.)]\r\n\r\nThe neck of _†Theosodon_ was even longer proportionately than in\r\n_†Macrauchenia_ and the transference of the canal for the vertebral\r\nartery from the transverse processes to the neural arch had already taken\r\nplace, except in the first, sixth and seventh vertebræ, and was thus\r\nless complete than in the Pampean genus, in which all the vertebræ of\r\nthe neck, save the seventh, had the canal in its exceptional position.\r\nThe odontoid process of the axis was less modified than in the latter,\r\nbeing relatively longer and more conical. The body was rather short, and\r\nthe spines of the trunk-vertebræ were proportionally higher and more\r\nprominent. No caudal vertebræ have been found, but, from the shape of\r\nthe sacrum, it is evident that the tail was short.\r\n\r\nThe limbs were long, but more slender and less elongate than in\r\n_†Macrauchenia_, in which the growth of the neck did not keep pace with\r\nthat of the limbs, the lengthening of the proboscis probably compensating\r\nfor this. The shoulder-blade had two conspicuous metacromia, very much as\r\nin the contemporary †toxodont, _†Nesodon_, but shorter and more widely\r\nseparated. The humerus was short and quite slender and the fore-arm\r\nbones, which were much longer, did not coössify. The femur had a more\r\nslender and rounded shaft than in _†Macrauchenia_ and a much larger\r\nthird trochanter; the leg-bones were also separate from each other.\r\nThe tridactyl feet were so like those of the Pampean genus, that no\r\nparticular account of them is necessary, and the proportions of the limb\r\nsegments were similar in both genera, short upper arm and lower leg, very\r\nlong fore-arm and thigh, and short feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 247. Left manus of _†Theosodon_. _S._, scaphoid.\r\n_L._, lunar. _Py._, pyramidal. _Tm._, trapezium. _Td._, trapezoid. _M._,\r\nmagnum. _U._, unciform. _V._, rudimentary fifth metacarpal.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the living animal, as shown in the restoration, was\r\nno doubt somewhat like that of _†Macrauchenia_, but less bizarre. That\r\nthere must have been some sort of a proboscis or prehensile upper lip,\r\nis indicated by the greatly shortened nasal bones, but this may not\r\nhave been longer than in the existing Moose or Saiga Antelope. The long\r\nneck, short body and tail and long limbs suggest an animal not unlike a\r\nGuanaco, but larger and heavier. The hair may or may not have had the\r\nwoolly character given to it in the drawing; upon such a point there can\r\nbe no certainty.\r\n\r\nIn the older formations preceding the Santa Cruz, the †macrauchenids are\r\nknown only from fragmentary material, though something of their history\r\nmay be made out even from these fragments. _†Protheosodon_, of the\r\nDeseado stage, was considerably smaller than the Santa Cruz genus and had\r\nmore primitive upper molars, in that the internal cusps and intermediate\r\ncuspules were isolated and conical, not forming transverse crests. Still\r\nsmaller were the several genera (_†Lambdaconus_, etc.) related to the\r\n†macrauchenids found in the Casa Mayor Eocene, which have been referred,\r\nperhaps correctly, to the †Condylarthra. In these the formation of the\r\nexternal wall of the almost bunodont upper molars was in progress, by the\r\nfore-and-aft extension and transverse thinning of the external cusps;\r\nthe internal pair of cusps and the cuspules were separate and conical.\r\nWith much confidence, it may be inferred that in these little animals\r\nthe skull was normal, the nasal bones were long and that the feet were\r\nfive-toed, but demonstration is lacking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second family of the †Litopterna, the †Proterotheriidæ, were\r\nremarkable for their many deceptive resemblances to the horses. Even\r\nthough those who contend that the †Litopterna should be included in the\r\nPerissodactyla should prove to be in the right, there can be no doubt\r\nthat the †proterotheres were not closely related to the horses, but\r\nformed a most striking illustration of the independent acquisition of\r\nsimilar characters through parallel or convergent development. The family\r\nwas not represented in the Pleistocene, having died out before that\r\nepoch, and the latest known members of it lived in the upper Pliocene\r\nof Monte Hermoso. In the still older Paraná formation more numerous\r\nand varied forms occurred, but only from the Santa Cruz have materials\r\nbeen obtained of sufficient completeness to furnish a full account of\r\nthe structure of these extraordinary animals. Not that this remarkable\r\ncharacter was due to grotesque proportions; on the contrary, they looked\r\nfar more like the ordinary ungulates of the northern hemisphere than\r\ndid any of their South American contemporaries; it is precisely this\r\nresemblance that is so notable.\r\n\r\nIn Santa Cruz times the family was represented by a large number of\r\nspecies, which have been grouped in four or five genera, which differed\r\nsufficiently to require generic separation, yet were closely similar.\r\nIn all of them the dental formula was: _i_ 1/2, _c_ 0/1, _p_ 4/4, _m_\r\n3/3, × 2 = 36. Except in one genus (_†Thoatherium_) a pair of small\r\ntusks was formed by the enlargement of the second upper and third lower\r\nincisors, as in the †toxodonts, but the first upper and lower and the\r\nthird upper incisors, which were retained in the †toxodonts, were lost\r\nin this family, as was also the upper canine, and the lower canine was\r\nvery small, of no functional use. The teeth were brachyodont and, except\r\nthe small tusks, displayed no tendency at any time toward the acquisition\r\nof high crowns. The premolars were less complex than the molars, though\r\nthe last one approximated the molar-pattern. The upper molars had two\r\ncrescentic outer cusps, meeting in a vertical ridge and together forming\r\nthe outer wall; the transverse crests were imperfect, especially the\r\nhinder one which was often merely the intermediate cuspule, and did not\r\nfuse with the external wall. The lower molars had the two crescents, one\r\nbehind the other, which recur in the †macrauchenids, all the suborders\r\nof the †Toxodontia, except the †Pyrotheria, and other South American\r\nungulates, but the pillar in the posterior crescent, which was so\r\ncharacteristic of the groups named, was reduced to very small proportions\r\nand sometimes suppressed altogether. It should be noted, however, that\r\nthis was the loss of an element which was formerly present.\r\n\r\nThe skull had a long cranium and rather short face, with long, high\r\nsagittal crest. The neck was short, the odontoid process of the axis\r\npeg-shaped, and the canal for the vertebral artery was in its normal\r\nposition. The body was rather short, like that of a deer or antelope; the\r\nnumber of trunk-vertebræ is not definitely known in any of the genera,\r\nbut was very probably 19 or 20, and the tail must have been short.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 248.—Skull of _†Diadiaphorus_, Santa Cruz. American\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nThe limbs were slender and of moderate length; there was no\r\ncoössification between the bones of the fore-arm or the lower leg. The\r\nfeet were three-toed, except in one genus (_†Thoatherium_) in which they\r\nwere single-toed, and nearly or quite the whole weight was carried upon\r\nthe median digit, the laterals being mere dew-claws. The shape of the\r\nhoofs and the whole appearance of the foot were surprisingly like those\r\nof the three-toed horses, but there were certain structural differences\r\nof such great importance as, in my judgment, to forbid the reference of\r\nthese animals, not merely to the horses, but even to the perissodactyls.\r\nIn studying the †Litopterna, one is continually surprised to note the\r\npersistence of archaic and primitive characters in association with a\r\nhigh degree of specialization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 249.—Three-toed †proterothere (_†Diadiaphorus\r\nmajusculus_), Santa Cruz. Restored by C. Knight, from skeletons in the\r\nAmerican Museum and Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nThe largest Santa Cruz representatives of the family were the species\r\nof _†Diadiaphorus_, animals considerably taller than a sheep and of\r\nheavier build. Their appearance was not unlike that of a short-necked,\r\nhornless antelope, but with the feet of the three-toed horses! These feet\r\nwere, however, merely superficially like those of the horses, differing\r\nin points of fundamental significance. In the horses, the reduction of\r\nthe digits was accompanied by a readjustment of the carpal and tarsal\r\narticulations, so that, in proportion as the median toe was enlarged\r\nand the laterals reduced, the weight was shifted more entirely upon\r\nthe former. This is the method of digital reduction which Kowalevsky\r\ncalled “adaptive” and is exemplified in all existing artiodactyls and\r\nperissodactyls and by none more perfectly than by the monodactyl horses.\r\nIn “inadaptive reduction,” the method followed by _†Diadiaphorus_ and\r\nthe other genera of this family, there was no readjustment, or a very\r\nimperfect one, of the articulations, the lateral digits, however small\r\nand rudimentary, retaining the connections which they had when they were\r\nof full size and function. This distinction may seem to be unimportant,\r\nbut its significance is shown by the fact that not a single ungulate with\r\ninadaptively reduced feet has survived to the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 250.—Left pes of _†Diadiaphorus_, from specimens in\r\nPrinceton University and the American Museum. _Cal._, calcaneum. _As._,\r\nastragalus. _N._, navicular. _Cn. 3_, external cuneiform. _Cb._, cuboid.]\r\n\r\nIn still another respect the feet of _†Diadiaphorus_ deviated markedly\r\nfrom those of the horses, viz. in the great proportionate length of\r\nthe phalanges, especially of the first one, and the shortness of the\r\nmetapodials, the three phalanges of the median digit together exceeding\r\nin length the metacarpal or metatarsal, while in the horses this\r\nproportion is reversed. The skull of this genus was short, deep and with\r\nan anterior taper; it had a long sagittal crest, but a brain-chamber of\r\ngood capacity, considering its geological date. The nasals were quite\r\nshort, though the degree of shortening was not such as to suggest the\r\nexistence of a proboscis. In general appearance the skull recalls that of\r\none of the larger †oreodonts (p. 372) of the North American Oligocene.\r\n\r\nTo the genus _†Proterotherium_, the type of the family, belonged a\r\ngreat number of Santa Cruz species, for at that time the genus was in\r\na state of most vigorous development and the species were so variable\r\nthat satisfactory discrimination of them is exceedingly difficult.\r\nThey were all much smaller and slighter animals than the species of\r\n_†Diadiaphorus_, but did not differ from them in any important structural\r\ncharacter. The skull in this genus closely resembled that of the one\r\nlast named, save for its smaller size and lighter and more slender\r\nproportions; the nasal bones were considerably longer and the occiput was\r\nsomewhat wider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 251.—Skull of _†Thoatherium_, Santa Cruz. Princeton\r\nUniversity Museum.]\r\n\r\nA more isolated position was held by the genus _†Thoatherium_, which\r\nwas very clearly demarcated from all of the other genera of the family.\r\nIts species were the smallest of the commoner Santa Cruz members of the\r\norder and were of very light and graceful form. The dental formula was\r\nthe same as in the other genera, but there were no tusks; the single\r\nupper and two lower incisors were of nearly the same size and simple,\r\nchisel-like form. The upper molars had the same elements as in the\r\npreceding genera, but somewhat differently connected, the two internal\r\ncusps and the anterior intermediate cuspule being united into a nearly\r\nlongitudinal ridge. The skull was light, slender and pointed; the nasals\r\nwere shortened, though less than in _†Diadiaphorus_; the sagittal crest\r\nwas shorter than in the latter and the occiput was far narrower. The neck\r\nwas short, the body of moderate length and the tail short. The limbs\r\nand especially the feet were proportionately more elongate and slender\r\nthan in any other known genus of the family, giving quite a stilted\r\nappearance to the skeleton. The fore-arm bones were not coössified, but\r\nthe ulna was much more reduced than in any of the other genera of the\r\nfamily, and the same is true of the fibula, which, though very slender,\r\nshowed no tendency to unite with the tibia. The limb-bones, especially\r\nthe femur, had a decided resemblance to those of _†Mesohippus_, the lower\r\nOligocene tridactyl horse of North America, with the smaller species of\r\nwhich, _†M. bairdi_, _†Thoatherium_ agreed well in size. Most remarkable\r\nof all were the feet, _which were more strictly monodactyl than those\r\nof any other known mammal_. The single functional digit, the third, had\r\non each side of its upper end a very small, scale-like nodule of bone,\r\nthe last vestiges of the lateral digits, corresponding to the immensely\r\nlarger splints of the horse. Despite the unrivalled completeness of\r\ndigital reduction which _†Thoatherium_ displayed, the mode of reduction\r\nwas inadaptive and the rudimentary metapodials retained the same carpal\r\nand tarsal connections that they originally had in the pentadactyl manus,\r\na very great difference from the horses. The ankle-joint also was of\r\nthe same primitive character as in the other †Litopterna. The feet were\r\nrelatively longer and more slender than in the other †proterotheres and\r\nthe metapodial of the single functional digit longer in proportion to the\r\nphalanges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 252.—Single-toed †proterothere (_†Thoatherium\r\nminusculum_), Santa Cruz. Restored by C. Knight from a skeleton in the\r\nmuseum of Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the living animal, aside from the character of the\r\nhair, colour-pattern, etc., may be closely inferred from the skeleton.\r\nIt was a much smaller and more graceful animal than its contemporary and\r\nrelative _†Diadiaphorus_, as light and agile as a gazelle. The head had\r\nsome resemblance to that of a small horse, but the neck was much shorter\r\nthan in the horses; the body also was shorter than in the latter, and\r\nthe proportions of the trunk and limbs were quite as in the smaller\r\nantelopes. But these likenesses to horses and antelopes were, it must\r\nagain be emphasized, superficial; the fundamental characteristics of\r\nstructure were more primitive than in the most ancient known artiodactyls\r\nand perissodactyls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 253.—Left pes of _†Thoatherium_. Princeton University\r\nMuseum. Letters as in Fig. 250.]\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the fragmentary material which alone represents the\r\n†proterotheres in the formations preceding and following the Santa\r\nCruz in time, it is not practicable to trace the development of the\r\nvarious phyla in a satisfactory manner. Two of the Santa Cruz genera,\r\n_†Diadiaphorus_ and _†Proterotherium_, continued into the lower Pliocene\r\n(Paraná), and two additional ones have been named, but little is known\r\nabout them. The latest known member of the family so far discovered is\r\na genus (_†Epitherium_) from the upper Pliocene of Monte Hermoso, a\r\ntridactyl form like _†Diadiaphorus_. It is a noteworthy fact that the\r\nmost advanced and specialized genus of the entire family ended with\r\nthe Santa Cruz, while the less differentiated types survived till a\r\nconsiderably later period. Possibly, it was the incoming of the highly\r\nefficient Carnivora from North America that led to the extermination of\r\nthe last †proterotheres.\r\n\r\nTurning backward from the Santa Cruz, the family may be traced without\r\nany question to the Deseado stage of the Oligocene, though nothing but\r\nteeth has yet been obtained, while in the Eocene it would appear to have\r\nbecome merged in the same group of small, †Condylarthra-like animals with\r\nquadritubercular molars, as those which are regarded as the probable\r\nancestors of the †macrauchenids. However likely this conclusion may seem\r\nto be, its confirmation must await the discovery of much more complete\r\nspecimens than are now available.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER †ASTRAPOTHERIA. †ASTRAPOTHERES\r\n\r\nIn the Santa Cruz another group of peculiar South American ungulates,\r\nthe †Astrapotheria, made its last recorded appearance. Though not at all\r\nuncommon in that formation, no complete or even partial skeleton has\r\nyet been found, but merely the skull and a few bones of the limbs and\r\nfeet. For this reason there is much doubt as to the systematic position\r\nand relationships of these animals, which were among the most curious\r\nof the many strange mammals which made up the Santa Cruz fauna. They\r\nwere mentioned in connection with the †Amblypoda (p. 456) as possible\r\nrepresentatives of that order in South America, but, as will be seen\r\nlater, this is an improbable conclusion, and the group appears to have\r\nbeen indigenous in the southern continent, in which, at all events, it\r\nhad a very long history. It has not been found in any formation later\r\nthan the Santa Cruz, unless the Friasian fauna, which contains it, should\r\nbe removed from that stage, of which it apparently forms the latest\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n    I. †ASTRAPOTHERIIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Astrapotherium_, Santa Cruz and Patagonian.\r\n        _†Astrapothericulus_, Patagonian.\r\n        _†Parastrapotherium_, Deseado. _†Astraponotus_,\r\n        Astraponotus Beds. _†Albertogaudrya_, Casa Mayor.\r\n\r\n    II. †TRIGONOSTYLOPIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Trigonostylops_, Casa Mayor. _†Edvardocopeia_,\r\n        Astraponotus Beds.\r\n\r\nThe genus _†Astrapotherium_, which was the only well-defined\r\nrepresentative of its family and order in the Santa Cruz stage, contained\r\nseveral species, some of them the largest animals of their time, as\r\nwell as the most grotesque in appearance. The dentition differed in\r\nsome important respects from that of all the other South American\r\nungulates, the formula being: _i_ 0/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 2/1, _m_ 3/3, × 2 =\r\n28. The upper incisors had completely disappeared, but the lower ones\r\nwere large and, what was an exceptional character, they were partially\r\ndivided into two lobes, somewhat as in the Eocene †uintatheres of North\r\nAmerica (p. 446). The canines were very large and formidable tusks, which\r\ngrew throughout life and apparently formed no root; the upper tusk was\r\nnearly straight and was obliquely truncated by the strongly curved and\r\nsharp-pointed lower tusk. This arrangement was very unusual among South\r\nAmerican hoofed mammals, many of which had no tusks at all; and in those\r\nwhich possessed them, such as the †toxodonts (p. 468), they were mostly\r\nincisors. Only in the †astrapotheres and †homalodotheres were there\r\ncanine tusks, and in the latter group they were small and of limited\r\ngrowth. All the teeth, except the canines, were brachyodont and, though\r\nrather high-crowned, formed roots before coming into use. The premolars\r\nwere small and greatly reduced in number (2/1), and in pattern were\r\nsimpler than the molars. The upper molars were constructed on essentially\r\nthe same plan as in the †Toxodonta; indeed, the first specimen of this\r\ngenus collected was referred to a large species of _†Nesodon_ by Owen.\r\nOn the other hand, the resemblance to the rhinoceros teeth is very\r\ndecided, and has led several writers to postulate a relationship between\r\nthe †astrapotheres and the rhinoceroses. The lower molars were of the\r\nbicrescentic pattern so frequently met with already; these teeth were\r\nvery narrow in proportion to their length and strongly suggest those of\r\n_†Metamynodon_, the supposedly aquatic rhinoceros of the North American\r\nOligocene (p. 346). It may be confidently inferred that so small a\r\nnumber of premolars was due to reduction from a full series, and this is\r\nconfirmed by the milk-dentition, in which the premolars were 4/3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 254.—Head of _†Astrapotherium magnum_. Santa Cruz.\r\nRestored from a skull in the museum of Princeton University.]\r\n\r\nThe skull was extremely peculiar, more so than in any other of the\r\ncontemporary genera of hoofed animals. The toothless premaxillaries were\r\nquite small, but thick, and must have supported an elastic pad, against\r\nwhich the lower incisors could effectively bite in cropping herbage. The\r\nnasal bones were extremely short and there must have been a proboscis or\r\ngreatly inflated snout, probably the former; the immense development of\r\nsinuses in the frontal bones elevated the whole forehead into a great,\r\ndome-like convexity, a feature which is not equalled in any other known\r\nmammal. The orbits were open behind and the brain chamber was small,\r\nso that the sagittal and occipital crests were very high and strong,\r\nto afford sufficient surface for the attachment of the great temporal\r\nmuscles. The horizontal portion of the lower jaw was shallow vertically,\r\nbut very thick and massive, and the symphyseal region was broad and\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the skeleton is still very incompletely known. Of the\r\nvertebræ, only the atlas and axis have been recovered, and these\r\nresembled those of the Santa Cruz †toxodont _†Nesodon_, on a larger\r\nscale. The scapula had a very thick spine, without the projections which\r\nwere found in most of the Santa Cruz ungulates. The limb-bones were long\r\nand comparatively slender, and the processes for muscular attachment\r\nwere singularly small and weak; the bones of the fore-arm and lower leg\r\ndid not coössify and were proportionately elongate, the tibia being but\r\nlittle shorter than the femur. The latter had the flattened shaft which\r\nrecurs in nearly all of the very heavy ungulates, but retained a remnant\r\nof the third trochanter. If the feet found isolated in the Santa Cruz and\r\nDeseado stages have been correctly referred to this order, then the genus\r\nwas five-toed and the feet were broad, short and heavy, quite elephantine\r\nin appearance, especially the fore foot. The ankle-joint was very\r\npeculiar and the calcaneum had no articulation with the fibula, which it\r\nhad in all the other indigenous South American ungulates.\r\n\r\nIncomplete as the material is, it is yet possible to form some general\r\nconception of this extraordinary animal when in life. The head was short,\r\nbroad and deep, rounded and very probably furnished with a proboscis; the\r\nneck was of moderate length, so that the mouth could not reach the ground\r\nwithout a straddling of the fore legs. The body was no doubt long, the\r\nlimbs long and rather slender, giving the animal a stilted appearance,\r\nthe feet very short, broad and columnar. Several species of the genus\r\nare known, which differed much in size, the largest (_†A. giganteum_)\r\nprobably exceeding any modern rhinoceros in height and length, and the\r\nsmallest (_†A. nanum_) not much larger than a Wild Boar.\r\n\r\n_†Astrapothericulus_, of the Patagonian stage, was smaller than the\r\naverage species of the Santa Cruz genus, and had teeth of the same\r\nnumber, but the canines were not capable of indefinite growth, and the\r\nlower molars had the pillar in the posterior crescent so characteristic\r\nof the South American hoofed animals. In the Deseado stage, on the\r\ncontrary, the †astrapotheres were of larger size, and in the commonest\r\ngenus, _†Parastrapotherium_, the grinding teeth had lower crowns and the\r\npremolars were more numerous, at least 3/2. In the still more ancient\r\n_†Astraponotus_, which gives its name to the upper Eocene (or lower\r\nOligocene) of Patagonia, the premolars were present in full series.\r\nIn the Casa Mayor the order was abundantly represented by still more\r\nprimitive genera, which assuredly had an undiminished number of teeth,\r\nthough this has not been proved. One of these genera, _†Albertogaudrya_,\r\nwas the largest animal of its time and the highly probable ancestor of\r\nthe series leading to the Santa Cruz _†Astrapotherium_.\r\n\r\nThe second family of the order, the †Trigonostylopidæ, did not survive\r\nbeyond the Eocene and is so imperfectly known that any account of it\r\nwould be to small profit.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the †Astrapotheria were an isolated group and their\r\nrelationships are problematical and are likely to remain so pending the\r\ndiscovery of much more complete specimens of the various genera which\r\nmade up the series. I am inclined to the opinion, however, that all of\r\nthe indigenous groups of South American ungulates, which inhabited that\r\ncontinent before the great immigration from the north, were derivatives\r\nof the same stock and more nearly related to one another than to any of\r\nthe orders which lived in other regions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn looking over the labyrinth of ungulate history, as recorded by the\r\nfossils, certain facts stand out clearly, while others are still very\r\nobscure. It is like trying to trace the plan of vast and complicated\r\nruins, which here are deeply buried in their own débris, there are fully\r\nexposed and in another place are swept away so completely that hardly a\r\ntrace remains. But the problem is far more complex than any which can\r\nbe presented by buildings, for the factor of repeated migrations from\r\ncontinent to continent comes in to obscure the evidence. Had each of the\r\ngreat land areas received its original stock of early mammals and then\r\nbeen shut off from communication with any other, many of the difficulties\r\nwould be removed, but the story would lose half its interest.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of the family, giving to that group the broad and\r\nelastic definition which has hitherto been employed, we have repeatedly\r\nfound it feasible to construct a phylogenetic series which very nearly\r\nrepresents the steps of structural modification as they occurred in\r\ntime. Much less frequently is it possible to trace allied families to\r\ntheir common starting point, and, so far as the hoofed animals are\r\nconcerned, in no case have we yet succeeded in doing this for the\r\nseparate orders. The obstacle lies in the fact that the ordinal groups\r\nwere already distinct, when they made their first appearance in the\r\nknown and accessible records, and the hypothetical ancestors common to\r\nthem all, or to any two of them, are to be sought in regions of which we\r\nknow little or nothing. Nevertheless, certain legitimate inferences may\r\nbe drawn from the available evidence. It remains to be proved whether\r\nthe assemblage of hoofed mammals, as a whole, was of single or multiple\r\norigin. Have all ungulates been derived from a common stock, or did they\r\narise independently from several groups of clawed mammals? While the\r\nrecords cannot be followed back to the point, or points, of origin of\r\nthe various orders, yet it is a noteworthy fact that, between several of\r\nthem, the differences grow less marked as the more ancient members are\r\nreached, as though they were converging to a common term; others again\r\nshow little such approximation, and the most probable conclusion from\r\nthe evidence now at hand is that the ungulate assemblage is composed of\r\nseveral independent series.\r\n\r\nOne such series is that of the Hyracoidea and Proboscidea, to which\r\nDr. Schlosser has given the name “Subungulata,” and has pointed out\r\nits relationship to the †Condylarthra, which, however, is not a close\r\none and may be illusory. Another apparently natural group is that of\r\nthe peculiarly South American forms, the †Toxodontia, with its four\r\nsuborders, the †Litopterna and the †Astrapotheria, which all appear\r\nto be traceable to closely allied families in the Eocene, whose teeth\r\nstrongly suggest derivation from the †Condylarthra; but the material does\r\nnot permit any positive statements. The Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla\r\nhave so many similarities that they have always been regarded as closely\r\nrelated groups, but the distinction between them was almost as sharply\r\ndrawn in their most ancient known members as it is to-day, and there was\r\nno distinct tendency to converge back into a common stem. Their mutual\r\nrelationships are thus obscure, but the Perissodactyla, at least, seem to\r\nbe derivable from a †condylarthrous ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe †Condylarthra, as a whole, were by far the most primitive of the\r\nungulates, which they connected with the clawed mammals. None of the\r\ngenera yet discovered can be regarded as ancestral to any of the higher\r\norders, but it is entirely possible that in the upper Cretaceous period\r\nthe †Condylarthra were spread over all the continents, except Australia,\r\nand that from them the other ungulate orders arose in different regions.\r\nAt all events, the †Condylarthra show how the transition from clawed to\r\nhoofed types may have occurred and perhaps actually did so, but it would\r\nbe premature to affirm this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CARNIVORA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the hoofed mammals, as sketched in brief outline in the\r\npreceding chapters (VIII-XIII), is a curious mixture of relatively full\r\nand satisfactory paragraphs, with scanty, broken and unintelligible ones,\r\nnot to mention those which have not yet been brought to light at all.\r\nWith all its gaps and defects, which inhere in the nature of things, the\r\nhistory of the various ungulate series is the best that the palæontology\r\nof mammals has to offer and constitutes a very strong and solid argument\r\nfor the theory of evolution. For the Carnivora the story is less complete\r\nand for obvious reasons. Individual abundance was a very large factor\r\nin determining the chances of preservation in the fossil state for any\r\ngiven species, and, as a rule, whole skeletons are found only when the\r\nspecies was fossilized in large numbers. In any region the Carnivora are\r\nless numerous than the herbivora upon which they prey, and while most\r\nungulates live in larger or smaller herds, the carnivores are mostly\r\nsolitary.\r\n\r\nThe Carnivora are divisible into three well-marked suborders, called\r\nrespectively the Pinnipedia, Fissipedia and †Creodonta. The Pinnipedia,\r\nseals, walruses, etc., which are almost purely marine in habitat, are not\r\ndealt with in this book, since so little can be learned of them from the\r\nfossils, and the †Creodonta, an extremely ancient and primitive group,\r\nwill be treated separately. The Fissipedia are chiefly terrestrial,\r\nthough they include the otters, and their subdivisions, so far as the\r\nAmerican forms are concerned, are shown in the following table, which,\r\nit should be observed, omits several genera. Unless otherwise noted, the\r\ngenera are North American.\r\n\r\n  Suborder FISSIPEDIA. Land Carnivora\r\n\r\n    I.

Oligo.\r\n\r\nTwo families, the hyenas (Hyænidæ) and civet-cats (Viverridæ), are\r\nomitted from the table because they apparently never reached the western\r\nhemisphere. The bears, of Old World origin, invaded America at a very\r\nlate period and are not certainly known here before the Pleistocene. The\r\nother four families were well represented in North American history,\r\nthough the great weasel tribe (Mustelidæ) went through the greater part\r\nof its history in the Old World. None of the families is indigenous\r\nin South America, and all of the five families which it now shares\r\nwith North America came in in the series of immigrations, of which the\r\nfirst recorded effects are found in the Pliocene and continued into the\r\nPleistocene.\r\n\r\nThe Fissipedia are adapted to a great variety of habits and modes of life\r\nand consequently there is considerable diversity of structure among them,\r\nthough they all form a homogeneous, natural group. The dogs (Canidæ)\r\nare terrestrial, neither swimmers nor climbers; some, like the foxes,\r\nare solitary, others, like the wolves, hunt in packs and nearly all are\r\nstrong, swift runners. The cats (Felidæ) which have a remarkable range of\r\nsize, are terrestrial or arboreal; they take their prey by stalking and\r\nleaping upon it, not by running it down. The bears (Ursidæ) are mostly\r\nomnivorous, not very often killing prey, and largely vegetarian in diet.\r\nThe raccoons (Procyonidæ) are chiefly arboreal and omnivorous. The very\r\nlarge and varied weasel family (Mustelidæ) have different habits, though\r\nnearly all are fierce and bloodthirsty. Otters and sea-otters are aquatic\r\nand prey chiefly on fish; minks and fishers are semi-aquatic; martens are\r\narboreal, skunks terrestrial and badgers fossorial.\r\n\r\nWhile there is thus much diversity of habit with corresponding\r\ndifferences of structure among the Fissipedia, there is a certain\r\nunity of plan recognizable among them all. With but few exceptions,\r\nthe incisors are present in full number and the canines are formidable\r\nlacerating weapons. Especially characteristic of the dentition are the\r\n“sectorial” or “carnassial” teeth, always the fourth upper premolar and\r\nfirst lower molar, which form a pair of shearing blades, the premolar\r\nbiting outside. In the bears and most of the raccoons the teeth are\r\ntuberculated, in adaptation to the omnivorous habit, and the carnassials\r\nhave lost the shearing form, though clearly derived from that type. The\r\nskull has powerful jaws, and the crests and ridges for the attachment\r\nof the jaw muscles are prominent except in very small animals, and the\r\nstout, boldly outcurving zygomatic arches are very characteristic. The\r\nface may be elongate, as in the dogs, or extremely short, as in the cats,\r\nor of intermediate length; the brain-case is relatively capacious, and\r\nthe orbits, except in the cats, are widely open behind. The neck is never\r\nvery long, but the body often is, and the tail varies greatly in length,\r\nas do also the limbs. There is great difference, too, between the various\r\nfamilies in the prominence of the processes on the limb-bones for the\r\nattachment of muscles, as expressive of the muscular development of the\r\nlimbs, and also in the extent to which the fore foot can be rotated and\r\nused for grasping. In all existing Fissipedia the femur has no third\r\ntrochanter, but many extinct genera possessed it. The bones of the\r\nfore-arm and lower leg are always separate and uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIn the wrist (_carpus_) there is always a large bone, the _scapho-lunar_,\r\nwhich is made up by the coalescence of three elements, the scaphoid,\r\nlunar and central, a feature which, though recurring in a few other\r\nmammals, is essentially characteristic of the modern Carnivora. The feet\r\nare armed with claws more or less sharp, which in some families, notably\r\nthe cats, are retractile and may be folded back into the foot. The gait\r\nmay be plantigrade, as in the raccoons and bears, or digitigrade, as in\r\nthe dogs and cats, or intermediate in character.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Paleocene and most of the Eocene, there were no\r\nFissipedia, the flesh-eaters all belonging to the extinct †Creodonta, and\r\nthe first clearly recognizable fissipedes occurred in the upper Eocene or\r\nUinta.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Canidæ. Dogs, Wolves, Foxes, etc._\r\n\r\nThis family, which may with convenience be called simply dogs, is at\r\npresent the most widely distributed of the families of Fissipedia,\r\noccurring in every continent, even Australia, and ranging through all\r\nclimates almost from pole to pole. They are a singularly homogeneous\r\nfamily and show few differences of structure; such differences as\r\nthere are affect chiefly the number and size of the teeth and external\r\ncharacters, such as the size of the ears, length and colouring of the\r\nhair, etc. The many domestic breeds are not here considered. Almost alone\r\namong the Fissipedia the dogs capture their prey by running it down,\r\nand they are endowed with remarkable speed and endurance. The entire\r\norganism, especially the limbs and feet, are adapted to cursorial habits.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of comparison with the extinct genera of the family, some\r\naccount of a wolf will suffice. The wolves, like most other members of\r\nthe family, have a larger number of teeth than is usual in the suborder,\r\nas appears from the formula: _i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 4/4, _m_ 3/3, × 2 =\r\n42, that is to say, only the third upper molar has been lost from the\r\ntypical number, though the third lower is very small and seemingly on the\r\npoint of disappearance (Fig. 44, p. 93). The upper sectorial tooth, the\r\nfourth premolar, has its shearing blade made up of two sharp-edged cusps,\r\none behind the other, and there is a small internal cusp carried on a\r\nseparate root; the upper molars are triangular and tritubercular and are\r\nused for crushing. The lower sectorial, the first molar, has an anterior\r\nblade of two shearing cusps, with the remnant of a third, and a low,\r\nbasin-like posterior “heel.”\r\n\r\nThe skull is characterized by the long face and jaws and by the structure\r\nof the auditory region; the tympanic bones are inflated into large\r\noval bullæ, which are hollow and undivided, and the external opening\r\nof each is an irregular hole, without tubular prolongation. There is\r\nan alisphenoid canal for the passage of the internal carotid artery.\r\nThe neck, body and tail are of moderate length and the vertebræ of the\r\nloins are not conspicuously large and heavy. There is no collar-bone.\r\nThe limb-bones have a distinct, though superficial, resemblance to those\r\nof hoofed animals; the humerus has no very prominent ridges for the\r\nattachment of muscles and no epicondylar foramen, and the femur no third\r\ntrochanter. The fore-arm bones are separate, but are so articulated\r\ntogether and with the humerus as to give the fore foot no power of\r\nrotation. The manus in all existing wild species has five digits, though\r\nthe pollex or first digit is very small, a mere dew-claw; the four\r\nfunctional digits are arranged in two symmetrical pairs, very much as in\r\nthe artiodactyls, a longer median pair, of which the metacarpals have\r\na nearly square cross-section, and a shorter lateral pair (2d and 5th)\r\nof more trihedral form. All the metacarpals are closely appressed and\r\nalmost parallel. The pes has four digits arranged in similar fashion.\r\nThe claws are blunt and non-retractile, and are of little use in seizing\r\nor lacerating prey, but are useful in digging. The ungual phalanges have\r\nno bony hoods reflected over the base of the claw. All modern forms are\r\ndigitigrade.\r\n\r\nMaterials are lacking for the construction of any such detailed\r\nphylogeny of the dogs as has been accomplished for many ungulates.\r\nMany of the extinct genera are known only from skulls, or even jaws,\r\nand the well-preserved skulls are too few to form distinctly defined\r\nand continuous series. On the other hand, there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that the canine genera of the successive geological stages did\r\napproximately represent the successive steps of development within the\r\nfamily, though it is difficult to distinguish between the phyla.\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene dogs, for the most part, differed little from the\r\nRecent ones; there were some very large species like the _Canis †dirus_\r\n(Frontispiece) of the Mississippi Valley and the Pacific Coast. Two very\r\npeculiar genera have been reported. One (_†Pachycyon_), from a cave in\r\nVirginia, had remarkably short, stout and strongly curved limb-bones,\r\nwhich suggest otter-like habits; the other (_†Hyænognathus_), from\r\nCalifornia, had a very short face and extremely massive lower jaw and\r\nvery heavy teeth; it was probably like a hyena in appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 255.—Skull of _†Cynodesmus thoöides_, a lower Miocene\r\nwolf. Princeton University Museum. Compare with Fig. 7, p. 62.]\r\n\r\nAs far back as the Blanco stage of the middle Pliocene, remains occur\r\nwhich are assigned to the modern genus _Canis_, though better preserved\r\nspecimens would probably require their removal from that genus. In\r\nthe lower Pliocene the phylum of the true wolves was represented by\r\n_†Tephrocyon_, which, so far as it is known, differed only in minor\r\ndetails from _Canis_, and _†Tephrocyon_ went back to the middle Miocene.\r\nWhat would appear to be its direct ancestor is _†Cynodesmus_, of the\r\nlower Miocene, which, in view of the long lapse of time involved,\r\ndiffered less from the modern wolves than one would have supposed, but\r\nthe differences are significant, as pointing back to a far more primitive\r\ntype of structure. _†Cynodesmus_ was a small animal, intermediate in size\r\nbetween a Red Fox and a Coyote. The dental formula was the same as in\r\n_Canis_, but the teeth were relatively smaller and more closely crowded,\r\nas the face and jaws were shorter and the cranium, though longer, had\r\na less capacious brain-chamber. The cast of this chamber, which very\r\nperfectly reproduces the form of the brain, shows that the latter was\r\nnot only smaller but less convoluted than in the modern animals, and\r\nthis, in turn, denotes a lower grade of intelligence. The limb-bones were\r\nlike those of wolves, but the feet were quite different. In the manus\r\nthe first digit, or pollex, was much less reduced, though considerably\r\nshorter than the other digits, which were not in two symmetrical pairs,\r\nbut were all of different lengths, not closely appressed, but arranged\r\nin radiating fashion; the metacarpals had not yet acquired the quadrate\r\nor trihedral form, but were more oval in cross-section. The pes was\r\nmore modernized, but had five digits, which is not true of any existing\r\nmember of the family. The claws were thin and sharp and were slightly\r\nretractile, a power which has been completely lost in all the modern\r\ncanids. Such an animal could hardly have been preëminently cursorial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 256.—Skull of primitive “bear-dog” (_†Daphœnus\r\nfelinus_). White River stage. (After Hatcher.)]\r\n\r\nOut of the crowd of dog-like creatures in the John Day Oligocene, it is\r\nnot yet practicable to select one which is to be taken as the ancestor\r\nof the Recent wolves through _†Cynodesmus_, nor can this be done with\r\nbetter assurance of success in the White River, though the beginning\r\n(_†Daphœnus_) of the †bear-dogs in that formation probably closely\r\nrepresents the ancestral stage sought for. It is likely that several of\r\nthe phyla into which the family was divided became blended in a common\r\nstock at that stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 257.—Upper teeth of _†Daphœnus felinus_. _p. 4_ =\r\nfourth premolar. (After Hatcher.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 258.—Right manus of _†Daphœnus felinus_. _Sl._,\r\nscapho-lunar. _Py._, pyramidal. _Ps._, pisiform. _U._, unciform. (After\r\nHatcher.) Compare with Fig. 32, p. 82.]\r\n\r\nA second phylum, now entirely extinct, is that of the †bear-dogs, which\r\nis not certainly recorded later than the middle Pliocene, though some\r\nhave been doubtfully reported from the older Pleistocene of the Great\r\nPlains and the remarkable Californian genus, _†Hyænognathus_, may have\r\nbeen an offshoot of the same stock. The phylum was characterized by the\r\nunusually large size of the molars and by certain other features, which,\r\nhowever, are not known to have persisted through the entire series from\r\nfirst to last. In the middle Pliocene lived some very large bear-dogs,\r\nof the genus _†Borophagus_, the teeth of which had a strong likeness\r\nto those of the hyenas and probably the animals had hyena-like habits,\r\nfeeding largely upon carrion and crushing the stoutest bones with their\r\nmassive teeth. The same, or a very similar, genus lived in the lower\r\nPliocene, but none of the species of that date is at all well known. In\r\nthe upper Miocene occurred several species which have been referred to\r\nthe European genera, _†Amphicyon_ and _†Dinocyon_. The latter was an\r\nenormous canid, equalling in size the largest of living bears, the great\r\nKadiak Bear of Alaska, and, though probably having a long and heavy tail,\r\nwas much like a bear in appearance. The teeth indicate a more exclusively\r\ncarnivorous habit than that of the bears and these may well have been\r\nsavage and terrible beasts of prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 259.—Lower Miocene “†bear-dog” (_Daphœnodon\r\nsuperbus_). Restored from a skeleton in the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh.]\r\n\r\n_†Amphicyon_, which had three upper molars, continued down through the\r\nmiddle Miocene, but was replaced in the lower by _†Daphœnodon_, which\r\nmay or may not have been its direct ancestor. The uncertainty as to\r\nthe exact relationship between the two genera will remain until more\r\ncomplete material shall have been obtained from the middle Miocene.\r\n_†Daphœnodon_ was the largest dog of its time, the contemporary wolves\r\n(_†Cynodesmus_) having been hardly half so large, but was much inferior\r\nin size to the huge †bear-dogs of the middle and upper Miocene. The skull\r\nresembled that of a large wolf, but the tympanic bullæ were smaller and\r\nmore loosely attached and the molar teeth were relatively much larger, a\r\npersistent characteristic of this phylum. The very long and heavy tail\r\nwas a cat-like feature. The limbs were comparatively short and stout;\r\nthe humerus had the epicondylar foramen and the femur retained a trace\r\nof the third trochanter, both of which are lost in the modern members of\r\nthe family. The feet were not at all canine in type, but rather resembled\r\nthose of the ancient and unspecialized flesh-eaters. There were five\r\ndigits in manus and pes and were not arranged in parallel pairs, but\r\ndiverging; the metapodials were of oval cross-section, not squared, and\r\ntheir lower ends, which articulated with the first row of phalanges, had\r\nhemispherical surfaces, not semicylindrical. The claws were sharp and a\r\nremnant of former retractility was to be observed. Such an animal could\r\nhardly have been a strong and enduring runner and its structure suggests\r\nthat it captured its prey by stalking and leaping upon it. The wolf-like\r\nhead, with cat-like body, tail and limbs, made a strange combination, not\r\nclosely paralleled by any existing carnivore.\r\n\r\nThrough the Oligocene the phylum was carried back by the several species\r\nof _†Daphœnus_, assuredly the ancestor of _†Daphœnodon_ and decidedly\r\nmore primitive in many respects. The Oligocene genus was a much smaller\r\nanimal than its lower Miocene successor, the larger species hardly\r\nequalling a Coyote; the teeth were smaller and more closely set, but\r\nthe molars were proportionately large, while the carnassials were less\r\nfinished and effective shearing blades. The skull was less distinctively\r\ndog-like and had a smaller brain-case, with very prominent sagittal and\r\noccipital crests, a longer cranium and shorter face; the tympanic bones\r\nwere very small and so loosely attached to the skull that they are rarely\r\nfound, a very striking difference from all existing dogs. The backbone\r\nwas remarkable for the unusually large size of the lumbar vertebræ, a\r\npoint of resemblance to the cats and suggesting that _†Daphœnus_ had\r\ngreat powers of leaping; there was a long, heavy, leopard-like tail,\r\nand the caudal vertebræ were very like those of the long-tailed cats.\r\nThe limbs and feet were similar in character and proportions to those\r\nof _†Daphœnodon_, but the astragalus was less grooved for the tibia,\r\nthe claws were rather more retractile and the gait was probably more\r\nplantigrade. There were so many cat-like features in the skeleton of\r\n_†Daphœnus_, that the observer cannot but suspect that these resemblances\r\nindicate a community of origin, but, until the Eocene ancestors of the\r\ncats are found, the question of relationship must remain an open one.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient member of the bear-dog phylum yet discovered appears to\r\nbe one of the †creodont family of the †Miacidæ, found in the Uinta Eocene.\r\n\r\nA short-lived branch of the canine stock was that of the so-called\r\n“†hyena-dogs,” a peculiar American type, which abounded in the upper\r\nMiocene and lower Pliocene and then became extinct. Traced backward,\r\nthis brief series of species would appear to have sprung from the true\r\nwolves (_†Tephrocyon_) of the middle Miocene. The upper Miocene and\r\nlower Pliocene genus _†Ælurodon_ had several species, which differed\r\nconsiderably in size; the commoner of these were large wolves with\r\nvery modern type of body, tail, limbs and feet, but having short and\r\nmassive heads. The premolars were extremely thick and heavy, with such\r\na resemblance to those of the hyenas, that these animals have sometimes\r\nbeen mistakenly regarded as ancestral to that family. The especial\r\ncharacteristic, however, of the series was in the form of the upper\r\nsectorial tooth, which was much more feline than canine in construction\r\nand has given occasion for the generic name which means “cat-tooth.”\r\n\r\nA fourth phylum of the Canidæ, which would seem to be represented\r\nin the modern world by the Indian Dhole, or Wild Dog (_Cyon_), and\r\nperhaps by the Brazilian Bush-Dog (_Icticyon_), was characterized by\r\nthe lower sectorial molar, the heel of which was not basin-like, as in\r\nthe typical dogs, but trenchant and consisted of a single sharp-edged\r\ncusp, the external one of the primitive basin. Although there is no\r\ninherent improbability in the view that the Dhole and the Bush-Dog are\r\nderivatives of this phylum, no positive statement can yet be made, for\r\nthe gap in the history is too great to be bridged with any assurance.\r\nThe fossil members of the series did not come down later than the middle\r\nor upper Miocene and it is quite possible that the trenchant heel of the\r\ncarnassial was developed more than once. The middle and lower Miocene\r\nmembers of the series are still very imperfectly known and it is only\r\nfrom the upper Oligocene (John Day) that well-preserved skeletons have\r\nbeen obtained. These pertain to an aberrant member of the phylum, the\r\ngenus _†Temnocyon_, in which not only does the sectorial have a trenchant\r\nheel, but the second lower molar also was trenchant, having lost the two\r\ninner cusps, while the upper molars were as large as in the †bear-dogs.\r\n\r\n_†Temnocyon_ was a comparatively large animal and its skeleton had a\r\nmixture of primitive and advanced characters, the latter predominating,\r\nso that this genus was not only the largest but also the most specialized\r\ncanid of its time. There was the long, heavy tail, which all of the known\r\nOligocene carnivores possessed, but the limbs were long and the gait was,\r\nit would seem, thoroughly digitigrade. While the epicondylar foramen was\r\nretained by the humerus and the third trochanter by the femur, those\r\nbones were otherwise very modern in form. The feet were five-toed, but\r\nthe functional metapodials were parallel, appressed and with something\r\nof the quadrate shape. In very notable degree, therefore, the feet of\r\n_†Temnocyon_ anticipated the characters which the true wolves acquired\r\nconsiderably later. The less specialized _†Mesocyon_, which was smaller,\r\nwas the ancestor of the Miocene forms and was, in turn, very probably\r\nderived from the White River _†Daphœnus_.\r\n\r\nStill a fifth phylum, that of the †short-faced dogs (_†Enhydrocyon_),\r\nis very imperfectly known and has, so far, been found only in the lower\r\nMiocene and upper Oligocene. These also may have been descended from\r\n_†Daphœnus_, but the connection is not clear, nor has the relationship\r\nof the American genus to the extremely †short-faced dogs of the European\r\nPliocene been determined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 260.—Small, fox-like dog (_†Cynodictis gregarius_)\r\nof the White River. Restored from a skeleton in the American Museum of\r\nNatural History.]\r\n\r\nFinally, so far as North America is concerned, there was a phylum of very\r\nsmall fox-like canids, which ranged from the lower Miocene to the upper\r\nEocene and were very abundant, relatively speaking, in the White River\r\nand John Day. The dental formula was the same as in _Canis_ and the skull\r\nwas narrow and slender, though the brain-chamber was proportionately\r\ncapacious, and the face was quite short. The tympanic bullæ were large\r\nand inflated. The body and tail were long and the limbs quite short and\r\nweak. The humerus had no epicondylar foramen and the femur no third\r\ntrochanter. The five-toed feet had the spreading arrangement of the\r\nmetapodials seen in the more primitive fissipedes generally and the\r\nclaws were sharp. In proportions and appearance these animals must have\r\nbeen more like civets or weasels than like dogs and it is evident that\r\nthey were not swift runners. The series had its earliest representatives\r\n(_†Procynodictis_) in the Uinta and was doubtless derived from the\r\n†creodont family †Miacidæ. The White River species are referred to the\r\nEuropean genus _†Cynodictis_, those of the John Day and lower Miocene to\r\n_†Nothocyon_, and it has been suggested that this series gave rise to the\r\nfoxes, a suggestion which may prove to be true, but the very long gap in\r\ntime between these animals and the most ancient known foxes prevents any\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nTo determine the mutual relationships of the six phyla of Canidæ which,\r\nfrom the Eocene onward, inhabited North America in such numbers, is a\r\ntask of great difficulty and only a tentative solution of the problem can\r\nbe offered. The central stock would seem to be nearly represented by the\r\nWhite River _†Daphœnus_, leading through _†Cynodesmus_ and _†Tephrocyon_,\r\nof the Miocene, to the wolves. A short-lived series, apparently given\r\noff from _†Tephrocyon_, was that of the †hyena-dogs, which flourished\r\ngreatly in the upper Miocene and lower Pliocene and then became extinct.\r\nAnother branch, that of the †bear-dogs, was derived from _†Daphœnus_,\r\nthrough _†Daphœnodon_ to _†Amphicyon_, _†Dinocyon_ and _†Borophagus_, the\r\ngigantic Miocene and Pliocene forms, ending perhaps in _†Hyœnognathus_ of\r\nthe California Pleistocene. A third branch, represented by _†Mesocyon_\r\nand _†Temnocyon_, is believed to be continued to-day by the Asiatic Dhole\r\nand the Brazilian Bush-Dog. The †short-faced dogs (_†Enhydrocyon_) are\r\nstill very obscure. The last phylum, that of _†Nothocyon_, _†Cynodictis_,\r\n_†Procynodictis_, had become distinct in the upper Eocene and possibly\r\ngave rise to the foxes, but this is highly conjectural.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Felidæ. Cats_\r\n\r\nThe only other fissipede group whose development in North America may\r\nbe followed for a long period is that of the _†Sabre-Tooth Tigers_,\r\nthe subfamily _†Machairodontinæ_, which have been extinct since the\r\nPleistocene; the history of the True Cats (Felinæ) is much more obscure.\r\nIn most respects the two subfamilies agreed closely and, as they became\r\nseparate at least in the early Oligocene, they furnish instructive\r\nparallel series. The †sabre-tooth cats were terrible beasts of prey,\r\nwhich in most of the Tertiary period ranged over the whole northern\r\nhemisphere and in the Pleistocene or late Pliocene extended throughout\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 261.—Skull of the Pleistocene †sabre-tooth tiger\r\n(_†Smilodon californicus_, after Matthew). _P. 4_, fourth upper premolar,\r\nsectorial.]\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene genus _†Smilodon_ (Frontispiece) belonged to nearly the\r\nwhole western hemisphere and its various species were distributed from\r\nCalifornia and Pennsylvania on the north, to the Argentine Pampas on the\r\nsouth. The most obvious and striking peculiarities of _†Smilodon_ were\r\nin the teeth, which were much reduced in number, the formula being: _i_\r\n3/3-2, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 2/2-1, _m_ 1/1. The upper canine was a great, curved,\r\nscimitar-like blade, eight inches or more in length, with broad inner\r\nand outer faces, but quite thin transversely, and with finely serrate\r\nposterior edge. It is difficult to understand how these great tusks,\r\nwhich would seem to have blocked the entrance to the mouth, could have\r\nbeen effectively used, unless the creature could open its mouth much\r\nmore widely than any existing mammal, so as to clear the points of the\r\ntusks, and would then strike with them as a snake does with its fangs.\r\nThere are great anatomical difficulties in the way of accepting this\r\nexplanation and the problem, which is the same as that presented by the\r\n†uintatheres (p. 446), is still unsolved. It is, however, quite certain\r\nthat no arrangement which was disadvantageous, or even inefficient,\r\ncould have persisted for such vast periods of time. The lower canine\r\nwas much diminished and hardly larger than an incisor. The two upper\r\npremolars were the third and fourth of the original series; the third\r\nwas small, but the fourth, the sectorial, was a very large and efficient\r\nshearing blade. In addition to the two external trenchant cusps of the\r\nblade, which are present in the Carnivora generally, the cats have a\r\nthird small, anterior cusp which in _†Smilodon_ was large; the internal\r\ncusp had almost disappeared. The single upper molar was very small and\r\nso overlapped by the great carnassial as to be invisible from the side.\r\nThe third lower premolar was small and unimportant and most specimens\r\nhad lost it, leaving only the fourth, which was larger and evidently of\r\nfunctional value. The single molar was the sectorial, a large, thin,\r\nflattened blade, consisting of only two cusps, one behind the other, the\r\ntrenchant edges of which met at nearly a right angle, and there was no\r\ntrace of a heel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 262.—Upper teeth of _†Smilodon_, left side. _P. 4_,\r\nfourth premolar. _m. 1_, first molar. (After Matthew.)]\r\n\r\nThe skull was in appearance closely similar to that of one of the\r\ngreat modern cats, such as the Lion or Tiger; with extremely shortened\r\nface, heavy and widely expanded zygomatic arches and very prominent\r\nsagittal crest. The tympanic bullæ were large and inflated, each divided\r\nby a septum into two chambers, but were not visible from the side,\r\nbeing covered externally by very large processes, which served for\r\nthe attachment of some of the great muscles of the neck. The short,\r\nrounded, bullet-head of the true cats was thus repeated, but there were\r\nin the skull several interesting differences of detail, which it is not\r\nworth while to enumerate here. Suffice it to say, that some of these\r\ndifferences were due to the retention of primitive characters in the\r\nskull of _†Smilodon_, which have been lost in the modern felines, and\r\nothers to special developments, in which the true cats did not share. The\r\nlower jaw had on each side a small, descending flange for the protection\r\nof the tusks, which, however, projected well below these flanges when the\r\njaws were shut. The neck was heavy and the structure of its vertebræ was\r\nsuch as to suggest the presence of unusually powerful muscles; the back\r\nand loins were also uncommonly stout, in the larger species heavier than\r\nin the Lion or Tiger, but, in marked distinction from those modern forms,\r\nthe tail was short. The limbs were shorter and much heavier in relation\r\nto the size of the body than in the great existing cats and must have\r\nbeen extremely powerful. The humerus usually had no epicondylar foramen,\r\nwhich all the true felines possess, though it was sometimes present.\r\nThe feet also were very stout and armed with large retractile claws;\r\nthe base of each claw was covered by a thin bony hood, an outgrowth of\r\nthe ungual phalanx, which is very characteristic of the entire family.\r\nThe hind foot had five digits, whereas no existing cat has more or less\r\nthan four. The appearance of these animals must have been very much like\r\nthat of the Lion or Tiger, aside from the unknown factors of mane and\r\ncolour-markings, but differed in the great tusks, the short tail and the\r\nshorter and more massive legs and feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 263.—Skull of a †sabre-tooth tiger (_†Machairodus\r\npalmidens_) from the Miocene of France. (After Filhol.) _P. 4_, fourth\r\nupper premolar, sectorial tooth.]\r\n\r\nOn account of the very incomplete preservation of the material so far\r\ncollected, little is known of the †sabre-tooth series in North America\r\nduring the Pliocene and Miocene epochs. Remains of very large cats have\r\nbeen found in the lower Pliocene and upper Miocene, but it is uncertain\r\nwhether they belong to the feline or the †machairodont subfamily. Some\r\nof the species have been referred to the genus _†Machairodus_, which\r\nranged from the lower Pleistocene to the middle Miocene of Europe, and\r\nthe reference may be correct, but is uncertain. However, the European\r\nrepresentatives of that genus, which are much better known, will serve\r\nto show the developmental stage from which _†Smilodon_ was undoubtedly\r\nderived. The dental formula was the same as in the American genus,\r\nthough there were generally two premolars in the lower jaw and in\r\n_†Smilodon_ generally but one; the individual teeth were formed on the\r\nsame plan as in the latter, but were relatively smaller, and the very\r\nsmall, rudimentary upper molar was visible externally and was not\r\noverlapped and concealed by the great carnassial; the sabre-like tusk\r\nhad not attained such great proportions. The skull of _†Machairodus_,\r\nthe only part of the skeleton which is definitely known, was like that\r\nof _†Smilodon_ on a much smaller scale, but more primitive in several\r\nrespects. It was longer and had a less capacious brain-case and less\r\nprominent sagittal and occipital crests. The large tympanic bullæ were\r\nconspicuous in the side-view of the skull, as the processes for the\r\nattachment of the neck-muscles had no such development as in _†Smilodon_.\r\nThe descending flanges of the lower jaw were larger than in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe upper Oligocene (John Day) contained a large variety of cat-like\r\nforms, of which no less than five genera have been described; one of them\r\n(_†Pogonodon_), nearly as large as a Lion, would seem to have died out\r\nhere without descendants, and two others, to which we shall return later,\r\nso combined the characters of true felines and †machairodonts as to be of\r\nuncertain reference. Two other genera, which are much commoner and better\r\nknown, from the White River, will be described from specimens of that\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nThe White River, or lower Oligocene, had three highly interesting genera\r\nof †machairodonts, two of them known from nearly or quite complete\r\nskeletons. One of these (_†Hoplophoneus_), which was, it can hardly be\r\ndoubted, the direct ancestor of the later typical †machairodonts, had\r\nseveral species, which are found in the various levels of the White\r\nRiver beds. The largest of these species was considerably smaller than\r\n_†Machairodus_, and the smallest and most ancient was inferior to the\r\nmodern Wild Cat. The number of teeth was variable, but normally greater\r\nthan in the genera above described, being _i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 3-2/3-2,\r\n_m_ 1/1, × 2 = 28-32. The foremost premolar in each jaw was very small\r\nand often absent. The upper canine was a long and curved, but very\r\nthin, scimitar, finely serrate on both edges, while the lower canine\r\nwas but little larger than the incisors. The carnassial teeth had a\r\nsignificant likeness to those of other fissipede families; the upper\r\none, the fourth premolar, was relatively smaller than in _†Machairodus_\r\nand its blade less effectively trenchant; the accessory antero-external\r\ncusp was present, though extremely small, and the internal cusp, which\r\nin _†Smilodon_ had almost disappeared, was quite large. The lower\r\nsectorial, the first molar, though already cat-like and consisting of\r\ntwo thin, broad and trenchant cusps in line, yet had vestiges of the\r\nheel and sometimes of the inner cusp. These vestiges were a connecting\r\nlink between the highly specialized sectorial of the cats and the type\r\nusual among the Fissipedia, which is exemplified by the dogs. The small\r\nupper molar was less reduced than in the Miocene and Pliocene genera and\r\nplainly consisted of a larger external and smaller internal cusp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 264.—White River †sabre-tooth tiger (_†Hoplophoneus\r\nprimævus_). Restored from a skeleton in the American Museum. †Oreodonts\r\n(_†Merycoidodon_) in the background.]\r\n\r\nCompared with that of other Fissipedia, the skull was short and broad,\r\nbut in comparison with that of the modern cats and of _†Smilodon_, it\r\nwas decidedly longer and narrower and the face was less abbreviated;\r\nthe resemblance to _†Smilodon_ was very marked in the form of the\r\ncranium, but, of course, the skull of _†Hoplophoneus_ was distinctly\r\nmore primitive in many respects. Thus, the orbit was much more widely\r\nopen behind, the tympanic bullæ were but imperfectly ossified, and\r\nthe perforations, or foramina, in the base of the skull, by which the\r\nnerves and blood-vessels communicated with the brain-chamber, were quite\r\ndifferent and had more resemblance to those of the ancient dogs (_e.g._\r\n_†Daphœnus_). In the classification of the Fissipedia much stress is\r\nlaid upon the number and arrangement of these cranial foramina, and it\r\nis very significant to find the primitive dogs and cats agreeing so much\r\nmore closely than do the modern members of these families. The lower jaw\r\nwas relatively much stouter than in _†Smilodon_ and the anterior flanges\r\nmuch more prominent, projecting downward so far that, when the jaws were\r\nclosed, the points of the tusks did not extend below the flanges. The\r\nanimal could have made no use at all of the sabre-tusks unless the mouth\r\ncould have been opened so widely as to clear their points.\r\n\r\nWith close general resemblance, allowing for the very inferior size, the\r\nskeleton of _†Hoplophoneus_ had many significant differences from that\r\nof _†Smilodon_. The neck was shorter and the body, especially the loins,\r\nlonger, lighter and more slender and the tail very much longer, equalling\r\nthat of the Leopard in relative length and surpassing it in thickness.\r\nThe limbs were much less massive and somewhat differently proportioned,\r\nthe upper arm being shorter and the fore-arm longer. The humerus, though\r\nfar more slender than that of _†Smilodon_, was remarkable for the great\r\ndevelopment of the deltoid and supinator ridges, the latter, together\r\nwith the shape of the radius, indicating very free rotation of the fore\r\npaw. The very prominent internal epicondyle was pierced by a foramen, and\r\nthe femur had a distinct remnant of the third trochanter. The five-toed\r\nfeet were comparatively small, but the claws were as completely\r\nretractile and as fully hooded as in any of the subsequent genera.\r\n\r\nThat _†Hoplophoneus_ was a fierce destroyer, is made evident by every\r\npart of its skeleton, and, like other cats, it no doubt subsisted upon\r\nwarm-blooded animals, which it killed for itself, the size of the prey\r\nbeing determined by the size and power of the particular species of the\r\n†sabre-toothed genus. In view of the probable extent of the Oligocene\r\nforests, the restoration (Fig. 264) gives the animal a spotted coat and\r\nthe general aspect is that of one of the modern spotted cats, but the\r\nprotruding ends of the tusks and the relatively long head distinguish\r\nit from any existing cat. “The presence of long, knife-like canines\r\nis correlated with powerful grasping feet possessing highly developed\r\nretractile claws. With its powerful feet the animal clung to its prey,\r\nwhile it struck repeatedly with its thin, sharp sabres” (J. C. Merriam).\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the White River stage lived one of the most highly\r\nspecialized of the †machairodonts, so far, at least, as the dentition\r\nis concerned, for only the skull is known. This genus, _†Eusmilus_,\r\nwhich also occurred in the Oligocene of Europe, was apparently an\r\nexample of premature specialization which led to nothing, for none of\r\nthe subsequent genera could have been derived from it. The teeth were\r\nreduced to a minimum in number: _i_ 3/2, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 2/1, _m_ 1/1, ×\r\n2 = 24, one lower incisor and at least one premolar less in each jaw\r\nthan had _†Hoplophoneus_. The canine tusk was very large and the flange\r\nof the lower jaw for its protection correspondingly elongated, being\r\nmore prominent than in any other †machairodont. The American species,\r\n_†E. dakotensis_, was the largest carnivore of its time and not greatly\r\ninferior in size to the Lion.\r\n\r\nStill another White River †machairodont, _†Dinictis_, differed in\r\nmany interesting ways from its contemporary _†Hoplophoneus_, being\r\nmore primitive and departing less from the ordinary fissipede type of\r\nstructure. This is shown by the greater number of teeth, which was\r\nnormally, _i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 3/3, _m_ 1/2, × 2 = 34. The upper\r\ncarnassial had a considerably larger internal cusp and the trenchant\r\nblade did not have the accessory anterior cusp, which is present in\r\nalmost all other cats and was thus more dog-like than cat-like. The lower\r\ncarnassial was more feline, but retained a remnant of the heel and of\r\nthe inner cusp, but the latter was variable, being sometimes present\r\nin one side of the jaw and not in the other, a sign that it was on the\r\npoint of disappearance. The upper molar was plainly a reduced form of\r\nthe tritubercular tooth, in plan like that of the dogs, while the second\r\nlower molar was a very small, single-rooted tooth. No other American cat\r\nhas such a primitive dentition as this, and, aside from the sabre-tusk,\r\nwhich was not nearly so long as in _†Hoplophoneus_, and the lower\r\ncarnassial, it might almost as well have belonged to a dog or musteline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 265.—Primitive †sabre-tooth (_†Dinictis felina_)\r\nfrom the White River. Restored from specimens in the American Museum and\r\nPrinceton University.]\r\n\r\nThe skull was very like that of _†Hoplophoneus_, but was still longer\r\nand somewhat different in shape, owing to the higher forehead and lower\r\nocciput. The primitive features of the cranial base, such as the\r\nforamina, the imperfectly ossified tympanic bullæ, etc., were repeated in\r\n_†Dinictis_, but the lower jaw had much less prominent flanges for the\r\nprotection of the tusks. The limbs differed considerably from those of\r\n_†Hoplophoneus_ in being relatively longer and more slender and retaining\r\nmore primitive features, such as the larger third trochanter of the\r\nfemur. The five-toed feet were decidedly small and weak, and the claws,\r\nthough retractile, were less so than in the other genus and were not\r\nhooded. The gait was probably plantigrade or semi-plantigrade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 266.—Skull of _†Dinictis squalidens_, White River.\r\n(After Matthew.) _p. 4_ = fourth upper premolar, sectorial.]\r\n\r\nThe relationships of _†Dinictis_ and _†Hoplophoneus_ are rather puzzling;\r\nnone of the known species of the former could have been ancestral to\r\nthe latter, for the two genera were contemporaneous. _†Dinictis_ was\r\napparently the somewhat modified survivor of the ancestral stage and\r\nrepresented very nearly the common starting point of both the feline and\r\n†machairodont subfamilies. Dr. Matthew has propounded the bold theory\r\nthat this genus was the actual ancestor of the felines, continuing the\r\nseries through _†Archælurus_ and _†Nimravus_ of the John Day to the\r\nunmistakable felines of the middle Miocene. This view runs contrary to\r\nthe supposed “law of the irreversibility of evolution,” a rule which\r\nmany authorities look upon as well established. The theory postulates\r\na different mode of development from anything that we have so far\r\nencountered in the series previously described and supposes that the\r\nupper canine first lost its original form, becoming a thin, elongate and\r\nscimitar-like tusk, while the lower canine was reduced almost to the\r\nproportions of an incisor and the lower jaw acquired a straight, flat\r\nchin and inferior flanges for the protection of the tusks. Then, after\r\nspecialization had advanced so far, it was reversed and the original\r\ncondition regained. This interesting hypothesis may possibly turn out to\r\nbe true, though personally I cannot accept it, and, should it do so, it\r\nwould necessitate a thoroughgoing revision of current opinions as to the\r\nprocesses of mammalian development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 267.—Left pes of _†Dinictis felina_. _Cal._,\r\ncalcaneum. _As._, astragalus. _Cb._, cuboid. Princeton University Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe only John Day cat which was assuredly derived from _†Dinictis_ was\r\nthe large _†Pogonodon_, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 268.—Skull of false †sabre-tooth (_†Nimravus\r\ngomphodus_) from the John Day. (After Matthew.) _p. 4_ = fourth upper\r\npremolar, sectorial.]\r\n\r\nAlso in the John Day stage lived _†Archælurus_ and _†Nimravus_, which,\r\nas was noted above (p. 249), have been called the “false sabre-tooths,”\r\nfor in them the upper canine was not much larger than the lower and the\r\nlatter, though smaller than in the felines, was yet very much less\r\nreduced than in the true †machairodonts. The skull closely resembled\r\nthat of _†Dinictis_, but the lower jaw was without flanges. The limbs\r\nwere long and slender and the feet long and digitigrade. The pes had\r\nonly four digits, of which the median pair was elongated and the lateral\r\npair shortened, so as to produce considerable resemblance to the pes of\r\nthe dogs, and the claws were partially retractile. The proportions of\r\nthe body, limbs and feet were suggestively like those of the Cheeta, or\r\nHunting Leopard (_Cynælurus jubatus_) of India, the generic name of which\r\nmeans “dog-cat,” and it is quite possible that the Cheeta may have been\r\nderived from some member of this “false †sabre-tooth” series, though\r\nthe connecting links are unknown. These cursorial cats quite displaced\r\nthe leaping †machairodonts of the _†Hoplophoneus_ type, at least in the\r\nOregon region at a time when, it will be remembered, that region had a\r\nremarkable variety of dogs. In other parts of the continent, of which we\r\nhave no record, the true †machairodonts must have been thriving, as may\r\nbe inferred from their comparative abundance in the later formations.\r\n\r\nConcerning the habits of these cursorial cats, Professor Merriam says:\r\n“When the canines are not developed to the dagger-like form for stabbing,\r\nthe premolar teeth serve a more definite purpose in the destruction of\r\nprey and would be less subject to reduction. The view suggested above\r\nfinds support in that such evidence as we have indicates that during\r\nthe deposition of the Middle John Day beds this region was in the main\r\na country of open plains, offering advantages to running types of\r\ncarnivores, and that during this epoch the _Archælurus-Nimravus_ type of\r\nfeline was by far the most common form [_i.e._ of cats].” The derivation\r\nof these cats is still obscure, but their likeness to certain forms of\r\nthe European Oligocene suggests that they were immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe true cats of the subfamily Felinæ include the great variety of\r\nliving forms, large and small, from the Lion and Tiger at one extreme\r\nto the Domestic Cat at the other. There is great difference among\r\nnaturalists with regard to the nomenclature of the Recent cats; some\r\nmake a considerable number of separate genera, while others include all\r\nthe species, except the lynxes and the Cheeta, in the genus _Felis_. For\r\nthe purposes of this book the latter practice is the more convenient and\r\nwill be followed. In _Felis_ the dental formula is: _i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_\r\n2-3/2, _m_ 1/1, × 2 = 28-30; the canines are large and strong, of oval\r\nsection, and the upper one is but little larger than the lower; there\r\nare two large and functional premolars in each jaw, and an additional\r\nvery small one may or may not be present in the upper jaw. The upper\r\nsectorial has a large shearing blade, with well-developed anterior\r\naccessory cusp, and the inner cusp, which in _†Smilodon_ had almost\r\ndisappeared, is quite large and carried on a separate root. The lower\r\nsectorial is composed of two cusps only, all traces of the heel and of\r\nthe inner cusp having disappeared. The single upper molar is very small\r\nand usually concealed by the sectorial. The skull is very short and\r\nbroad, and the shortening of the jaws gives great power to the biting\r\nmuscles, because of the more favourable leverage. The zygomatic arches\r\nare very stout and curve out boldly, contributing much to the rounded\r\nshape of the head; the orbits are almost encircled in bone. The large\r\ntympanic bullæ are two-chambered and there is no alisphenoid canal, but\r\nin several other respects the base of the cranium differs markedly from\r\nthat of _†Smilodon_. The lower jaw is without flanges and there is no\r\nangle between front and sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 269.—Dentition of Lynx (_L. rufus_), left side. _i.\r\n3_, external upper incisor. _i. 1_, first lower incisor. _c._ = canine.\r\n_p. 3_, _p. 4_, third and fourth premolars. _m. 1_, first molar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 270.—Upper teeth of Puma (_Felis concolor_), left\r\nside. _p. 4_, fourth premolar. _m. 1_, first molar.]\r\n\r\nThe neck is short, the body long and the tail is long in most of the\r\nspecies, but short in the lynxes. The limbs are relatively longer and\r\nless massive than in _†Smilodon_, and there are five toes in the manus,\r\nfour in the pes; the claws are hooded and retractile.\r\n\r\nThe western hemisphere at the present day contains none of the very large\r\nspecies, the Puma and Jaguar being the largest; but this was not true of\r\nthe Pleistocene, where a huge cat (_Felis †atrox_), surpassing the Lion\r\nin size, ranged over the southern half of North America. Enormous cats\r\nalso lived in the lower Pliocene and upper Miocene of the Great Plains\r\nregion, but are not sufficiently well known for reference to either\r\nsubfamily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 271.—Skull of Puma (_Felis concolor_). _p. 4_, upper\r\ncarnassial. The upper molar is concealed.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the true felines has been but partially deciphered,\r\nand can, as yet, be traced back only to the middle Miocene, the genus\r\n_†Pseudælurus_ representing the series both in Europe and North America.\r\nIn this genus the dental formula was nearly the same as in _Felis_, but\r\nthere was frequently an additional small premolar in the lower jaw and\r\nthe sectorials were more primitive, the upper one having the accessory\r\nanterior cusp in a merely incipient stage and in the lower one there was\r\na vestige of the heel. The upper canine was considerably longer than the\r\nlower, thinner and more blade-like than in _Felis_, which, so far as it\r\ngoes, is in favour of Dr. Matthew’s theory (p. 541). What little is known\r\nof the skull and skeleton of _†Pseudælurus_ agrees with the modern cats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 272.—Left manus of Domestic Cat (_Felis domestica_,\r\nafter Jayne). The horny claws are left in place, covering the ungual\r\nphalanges.]\r\n\r\nWhile it is not feasible to trace the series of true felines to an\r\nearlier stage than the middle Miocene, there can be no doubt that the\r\nsubfamily was derived from the same stock as the †machairodonts and it is\r\nprobable that the White River _†Dinictis_ nearly represents the common\r\nstarting point for both series; the resemblances between _†Dinictis_ and\r\nsuch primitive dogs as _†Daphœnus_ are suggestive of a common origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Procyonidæ. Raccoons, etc._\r\n\r\nAn almost exclusively American family of Fissipedia is that of the\r\nraccoons, which includes not only the latter (_Procyon_), but also the\r\ncoatis (_Nasua_), curious animals, with long, flexible, pig-like snouts,\r\nthe cacomistles (_Bassariscus_) and kinkajous (_Potos_). In addition\r\nto these American forms, there is an outlying Asiatic genus, the Panda\r\n(_Ælurus_) of the southeastern Himalayas, the last of a series which goes\r\nback to the European Pliocene.\r\n\r\nThe Procyonidæ are animals of small and moderate size, largely arboreal\r\nin habits and subsisting upon a mixed diet of fruit, eggs, insects and\r\nthe like; the teeth are adapted to this diet and the sectorials have\r\nmostly lost their shearing form and the molars are tuberculated for\r\ncrushing and grinding. The species generally have long tails, except\r\nin the raccoons proper, in which the tail is of medium length, and\r\nfive-toed, plantigrade feet, with naked soles. Fossil members of this\r\nfamily are very rare in Tertiary formations and its history is therefore\r\nbut scantily known; in the lower Pliocene have been found fragmentary\r\nremains with less specialized teeth, which appear to belong to the direct\r\nancestor of _Bassariscus_. The upper Miocene genus _†Leptarctus_ was an\r\nundoubted member of the family, and, while it would seem not to have been\r\nin the direct line of any of the modern forms, it was near to the common\r\nancestry of the American genera, so far as the imperfect specimens enable\r\nus to judge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 273.—Dentition of Raccoon (_Procyon lotor_), left\r\nside. _i. 3_, external incisor. _c._, canine. _p. 4_, fourth premolar.\r\n_m. 1_, first molar.]\r\n\r\nBy far the most primitive representative of the family yet discovered\r\nis the lower Miocene genus _†Phlaocyon_, which connected the Procyonidæ\r\nwith the Oligocene genus of dogs, _†Cynodictis_ (p. 529). The dentition\r\nresembled that of the latter, with several differences, which were all\r\nchanges toward the Procyonidæ. All the cusps were lower and blunter\r\nthan in _†Cynodictis_; the premolars were small, thick and closely\r\ncrowded together and the upper sectorial, while still trenchant, had a\r\npostero-internal cusp, which is found in none of the Canidæ and was a\r\nfirst step toward the tuberculated pattern of the raccoons, and the lower\r\nsectorial had a very low cutting blade and large heel; the other molars\r\nof both jaws were low, wide and of subquadrate shape. The skull was\r\nshort and broad, with the face as much shortened and the orbits as far\r\nforward as in _Procyon_, but the brain-case was narrower, less capacious,\r\nand the lower jaw had the curved form and much the same character as in\r\nthe modern genus. The limbs were relatively more slender than in the\r\nlatter and the five-toed feet were more canine than procyonine in the\r\nproportions of the digits.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of _†Phlaocyon_ by Dr. Matthew was an event of capital\r\nimportance, as showing the highly probable derivation of the raccoons\r\nfrom _†Cynodictis_ and thus bringing another fissipede family into\r\nrelationship with the dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Ursidæ. Bears_\r\n\r\nThe present distribution of the bear family is all but exclusively\r\nnorthern, as there is but one African species, confined to the\r\nnorthwestern corner of that continent, and one in the Andes of Peru and\r\nEcuador, all the others belonging to Eurasia and North America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 274.—Dentition of Black Bear (_Ursus americanus_).\r\n_i. 3_, external incisor. _c._, canine. _p. 1_, first premolar. _p. 4_,\r\nfourth premolar. _m. 1_, first molar.—Below is a view, on a larger scale,\r\nof the grinding surface of the fourth premolar and first molar, upper\r\njaw.]\r\n\r\nStructurally, the family is very distinct and the dentition is quite\r\npeculiar. The incisors and canines resemble those of other Fissipedia;\r\nthe three anterior premolars are very small, single-rooted and often\r\nshed early; the carnassials have lost their trenchant character; and the\r\nmolars, which are usually longer than wide, are tuberculated, somewhat\r\nresembling those of pigs. Almost all the bears live principally upon\r\nvegetable food, and even the Polar Bear, which feeds upon fish and seals,\r\nwill eat grass and berries in the brief Arctic summer; thus, the shearing\r\nteeth of the strictly carnivorous types are unnecessary to these animals.\r\nThe skull is not unlike that of the dogs in shape, but the tympanic bullæ\r\nare much flattened and the entrances to them are long, bony tubes, while\r\nthe cranial foramina are nearly as in the dogs. The body is very heavy\r\nand the tail always short. The limbs are short and thick; the humerus\r\nhas lost the epicondylar foramen in all existing species except the\r\nSouth American Spectacled Bear (_Tremarctos ornatus_). The plantigrade\r\nfeet have naked soles (except in the Polar Bear) and each foot has five\r\nwell-developed and functional digits, armed with very long, sharp and\r\nnon-retractile claws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 275.—Restored head of the †Short-faced Bear\r\n(_†Arctotherium bonæerense_). From a skull in the National Museum, Buenos\r\nAires.]\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene representatives of the family in America included species\r\nof the true bears (_Ursus_) and of the very large †short-faced bears\r\n(_†Arctotherium_) which ranged over both North and South America. In\r\n_†Arctotherium_ the dentition was less modified; the larger premolars\r\nwere very closely crowded together and the molars were nearly square;\r\nthe lower jaw was almost as much curved as in the raccoons. The humerus\r\nretained the epicondylar foramen. The family, which was of Old World\r\norigin, may have reached America in the lower Pliocene, but was rare\r\nuntil the late Pleistocene. _†Arctotherium_ has not been found in the\r\neastern hemisphere, but that, of course, is no proof that the genus\r\nwas not an immigrant from Asia. On the other hand, it may have been a\r\npeculiar American development from Pliocene immigrants. In the Old World,\r\nbears were first distinguishable in the upper Miocene, and may be there\r\ntraced back to forms which were unmistakably derivatives of the early\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Mustelidæ. Mustelines_\r\n\r\nThe last fissipede family, which has, or has had, representatives in\r\nthe western hemisphere is that which includes a great variety of small\r\ncarnivores, such as minks, martens, skunks, badgers, otters, etc., and\r\nwas likewise of Old World origin, though now of universal distribution,\r\nexcept in Australia and Madagascar. These are fierce and bloodthirsty\r\nbeasts of prey, most of them strictly carnivorous and often killing in\r\nmere wantonness more than they can devour. Though now quite numerous and\r\nvaried in North and South America, they are decidedly less so than in the\r\neastern hemisphere and comparatively few peculiar types have originated\r\nhere. Owing to the small size and fragility of the skeletons, they have\r\nnot been well preserved as fossils, and little can be done as yet in\r\ntracing out the genealogy of the various phyla.\r\n\r\nThe mustelines have shortened jaws and a reduced number of teeth, the\r\nmolars being 1/2 or even 1/1 and the premolars varying from four to two,\r\nthough three in each jaw is the usual number. The cranium is generally\r\nvery long and the facial part of the skull short, but the soft snout\r\nmay add considerably to the length of the face. The tympanic bullæ are\r\nsingle-chambered and little inflated, and the lower lip of the entrance\r\nis extended; the hard palate is usually continued well back of the teeth.\r\nThe body is very long and the tail variable and, in most of the genera,\r\nis short rather than long. The limbs are short, the feet, except in one\r\ngenus, five-toed and plantigrade or semi-plantigrade, and the claws are\r\nnon-retractile. Terrestrial, arboreal, burrowing, aquatic and marine\r\nforms are all represented in the family.\r\n\r\nSo far as North America is concerned, it is scarcely practicable to do\r\nmore than catalogue the genera of the successive geological epochs.\r\nPleistocene mustelines were very modern in character, differing\r\nlittle from those now inhabiting the continent, though in some cases\r\nwith different ranges, according to climatic fluctuations. Badgers,\r\nmartens, skunks and others occurred then very much as they do now and\r\nthe Boreal Wolverene extended down to Pennsylvania. Little is known of\r\nPliocene mustelines, the Blanco having yielded fragments of only one\r\ngenus of uncertain affinities and though several genera occurred in\r\nthe lower Pliocene, but one, a marten (_Martes_), can be identified.\r\nUnquestionably, North America had many more Pliocene members of the\r\nfamily, but the conditions of preservation were unfavourable.\r\n\r\nMuch the same is true of the Miocene stages. In the upper Miocene\r\nthere were a marten (_Martes_), a weasel (_Mustela_) and two otters\r\n(_†Potamotherium_ and the modern _Lutra_), of which the marten and the\r\nmore primitive otter went back to the middle Miocene. In the lower\r\nMiocene were several mustelines quite different from any now existing.\r\nOne of those, _†Megalictis_, was truly gigantic, with a skull nearly as\r\nlarge as that of a Black Bear and having heavy, pointed claws. This and\r\na similar genus, _†Ælurocyon_, were related to the Ratel (_Mellivora_)\r\nof India and Africa and, more closely, to the Wolverene. _†Oligobunis_,\r\na much smaller animal, was apparently of the same group. This genus was\r\nalso in the upper Oligocene, but there represented by a larger species,\r\nwhich was as large as a badger.\r\n\r\nThe White River beds have yielded but a single genus, _†Bunælurus_, which\r\nwas the most primitive of American mustelines and had four premolars\r\nand two molars in each jaw, though the second upper molar was extremely\r\nsmall. The face was much less shortened than in the modern weasels and\r\nthe tympanic bullæ were short and strongly inflated and had no tubular\r\nentrance, and were thus canine rather than musteline in form. The\r\nbony palate was not extended back of the teeth as it is in the modern\r\ngenera. The same primitive group was much more abundant in the European\r\nOligocene, migrating probably from Asia into Europe as well as into North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICAN FISSIPEDIA\r\n\r\nThe history of the South American carnivores is a comparatively brief\r\none; the southern continent has representatives of the same five families\r\nas the northern, but most of the genera are different, the time since the\r\ngreat southward migration having been sufficient for the development of\r\npeculiar forms in the new environment. Among the dogs, there are to be\r\nnoted the curious, close-haired, long-bodied and short-legged Bush-Dog\r\n(_Icticyon_) and the fox-like wolves (_Cerdocyon_), but there are no\r\ntrue foxes. Of the cats, the Puma differs little from that of North\r\nAmerica, and the Jaguar (_Felis onca_) and Ocelot (_F. pardalis_) also\r\nrange into the northern continent, but several small cats are confined to\r\nSouth America, which has no lynxes. There is but one bear (_Tremarctos\r\nornatus_) of Andean range. Of the Procyonidæ, the northern _Procyon\r\nlotor_ is replaced by the Crab-eating Raccoon, _P. cancrivorus_, while\r\nthe coatis (_Nasua_) and kinkajou (_Potos_) are chiefly Neotropical.\r\nExcept for the otters, the genera of Mustelidæ are nearly all different;\r\nthere are no badgers and a different genus of skunks (_Conepatus_)\r\nreplaces the northern _Mephitis_; the Grison (_Grison_), Tayra (_Tayra_)\r\nand the Patagonian _Lyncodon_ are peculiar.\r\n\r\nEven less can be done to trace the evolution of the South American\r\ngenera than for the forms of the northern continent, whence migrated\r\nthe more or less different ancestors of the former. The Pleistocene has\r\nyielded most of the modern genera, both existing and extinct species. An\r\nexample of the latter was _Procyon †ursinus_ from the Brazilian caverns,\r\na truly gigantic Raccoon, as large as a bear. The †sabre-tooth tigers\r\n(_†Smilodon_) and short-faced bears (_†Arctotherium_) were shared with\r\nNorth America. In the Pliocene a bear, a raccoon and a dog were the only\r\nknown fissipedes, and in the Miocene none have been found, their place\r\nbeing taken by flesh-eating marsupials.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the history of the Fissipedia, as outlined in the preceding\r\npages, is sadly incomplete as compared with that of many ungulates,\r\nit is nevertheless highly suggestive. In each family the advance of\r\nspecialization and adaptation to a narrow range of habits may be\r\nfollowed; generally speaking, the teeth were diminished in number and\r\nincreased in size and were either simplified by the loss of parts, as in\r\nthe cats, or complicated by the addition of new elements, as in the bears\r\nand raccoons. The brain grew larger and more convoluted and the cranium\r\nmore capacious; in most of the families, the face was shortened, notably\r\nin the cats and mustelines, while in others, especially the dogs, it was\r\nelongated. In all of the early types there was a long and heavy tail,\r\nbut in most series it underwent more or less reduction. There was little\r\nreduction of digits, and no fissipede has less than four. In modern dogs\r\nand cats there are five digits in the manus and four in the pes and the\r\nhyenas have four in each, as has one genus of mustelines; other modern\r\ngenera throughout the suborder are pentadactyl.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that the more ancient members of the various families\r\ndiffered less than do the modern ones; the various groups, as they are\r\ntraced back in time, would seem to be converging to a common ancestry, of\r\nwhich the lower Oligocene dogs were the least changed representatives,\r\nand it is probable that all the families of the Fissipedia were derived,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, from a single Eocene group of primitive\r\nflesh-eaters. The families, none of which is extinct, are not all of\r\nequal antiquity. So far as now appears, the dogs and viverrines are\r\nthe most ancient, having become distinct in the upper Eocene; in the\r\nOligocene were added the mustelines and cats; the raccoons branched\r\noff from the dogs in the lower Miocene, as did the bears in the upper\r\nMiocene. Finally, the hyenas appeared in the lower Pliocene, seemingly\r\nderived from the viverrines. The dogs passed through the greater part\r\nof their development in North America, where, during the Oligocene and\r\nMiocene, they were very abundant and varied, while at the same time they\r\nwere comparatively rare in Europe and belonged chiefly to the phylum of\r\nthe †bear-dogs. On the other hand, the remaining four families are of Old\r\nWorld origin, the bears and mustelines migrating to America, while the\r\nviverrines and hyenas did not.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER †CREODONTA. †PRIMITIVE FLESH-EATERS\r\n\r\nThis group long preceded the Fissipedia in time, for they began their\r\nrecorded history in the Paleocene and became extinct in the Oligocene.\r\nThrough one family, the †Miacidæ, the †creodonts were broadly connected\r\nwith the fissipedes, and it seems probable that that family was the\r\nancestral stock from which all the fissipede families were derived. The\r\nother †creodont families died out without leaving descendants.\r\n\r\nThere is some difference of practice as to the number of families to be\r\nadmitted; the table contains those listed in Professor Osborn’s book and\r\nalso adopted by Dr. Schlosser. I should prefer a somewhat larger number\r\nof family groups, but the matter is one of secondary importance.

Only seven genera\r\nare known from skeletons, and several more from skulls, but most are\r\nrepresented only by jaws and teeth; limb- and foot-bones, however, give\r\nus a conception of the general structure of a considerable number. As\r\na rule, the dentition was complete, according to the formula, _i_ 3/3,\r\n_c_ 1/1, _p_ 4/4, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 44, but the first premolar or the last\r\nmolar may be lost. The canines were always large, as was befitting for\r\nbeasts of prey. In only one family, the Miacidæ, were the carnassial\r\nteeth confined to a single pair and those the same as in the Fissipedia,\r\nthe fourth upper premolar and first lower molar; in all the other\r\nfamilies there were either no sectorial teeth, or else there was more\r\nthan one pair. In the Fissipedia the first is the largest of the lower\r\nmolars, while in the †Creodonta (except the †Miacidæ) it was usually the\r\nsmallest. The premolars were generally simple, compressed-conical teeth\r\nand the molars, with all their great variety, may be reduced to a common\r\nplan; those of the upper jaw were primitively tritubercular, with a\r\ntriangle of two external and one internal cusps, and those of the lower\r\njaw were in two distinct parts, an anterior, elevated triangle of three\r\ncusps and a low heel of two.\r\n\r\nThe skull was almost always very large in proportion to the size of the\r\nanimal; the cranium, though long, was of small capacity and the face\r\nvaried much in length in the different families. Primitively, the face\r\nand jaws were short in correlation with the small size of the teeth, and\r\nthis primitive condition was modified in two opposite directions; in\r\none the face and jaws were elongated, as the teeth enlarged, and in the\r\nother they were shortened still further. The zygomatic arches were stout\r\nand curved out strongly from the sides of the skull, making very wide\r\nopenings, and, in almost all cases, the sagittal and occipital crests\r\nwere very high, as would be necessary from the combination of powerful\r\njaws and small brain-case (see p. 63). The tympanic bullæ were not\r\nossified. The brain was extremely small, especially in the more ancient\r\ngenera, and the convolutions were almost always few and simple, which\r\nindicates a low grade of intelligence and very marked inferiority to the\r\nFissipedia.\r\n\r\nIn all the genera of which sufficient material has been obtained the body\r\nwas long and had 19 or 20 trunk-vertebræ: in the lumbar and posterior\r\npart of the dorsal regions the processes by which the successive\r\nvertebræ were articulated together (zygapophyses) were cylindrical and\r\ninterlocking, as in the artiodactyl ungulates (p. 360). To this general\r\nstatement, the †Miacidæ formed a partial exception. The tail was very\r\nlong and heavy in all the forms of which the caudal vertebræ are known,\r\nand this was probably true of all. The limbs were short and generally\r\nheavy; the femur had the third trochanter and the humerus, save in a few\r\nof the later genera, the epicondylar foramen, and the manus could, in\r\nnearly all, be freely rotated. Except in the most advanced forms of one\r\nfamily, the †Mesonychidæ, the feet were five-toed and plantigrade, or\r\nsemi-plantigrade, and of decidedly primitive structure. The scapho-lunar\r\nbone of the Fissipedia (see p. 519) was not formed, its three elements,\r\nwith very few exceptions, remaining separate. The astragalus nearly\r\nalways had a shallow groove, or none at all. The claws were thick\r\nand blunt and the ungual phalanges cleft at the end, except in the\r\n†Arctocyonidæ and †Miacidæ, which had sharp claws and uncleft phalanges.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief description, it is obvious that the †Miacidæ occupied\r\na very isolated position among the †creodonts and, in my judgment, it\r\nwould be better to transfer that family to the Fissipedia and include the\r\nothers in a separate order.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Paleocene and Eocene epochs the †Creodonta were numerous\r\nand varied, the first of the Fissipedia appearing in the upper Eocene.\r\nTill then the †creodonts were the only predaceous mammals in North\r\nAmerica and Europe, and they were especially abundant in the former.\r\nMost members of the suborder and all the Paleocene forms were of small\r\nor moderate size, but some of the Eocene species were very large. In the\r\nUinta the †creodonts were greatly decreased in numbers and in the White\r\nRiver there were only two genera of one family, the †Hyænodontidæ, and\r\nsince the Oligocene the suborder has been extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _†Miacidæ. Fissipede-like †Creodonts_\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that no member of this family is known from a complete\r\nskeleton, but the material collected is sufficient to give a fairly\r\nadequate conception of these most interesting animals. These were the\r\nonly †creodonts with a single pair of carnassials, the fourth upper\r\npremolar and first lower molar, but in some of the genera the carnassials\r\ndid not differ greatly from the other teeth. In the various genera the\r\nskull differed considerably in length and in the proportions of cranium\r\nand face; the brain-case was larger than in most other †creodonts and\r\nthe brain more advanced, though smaller than in the fissipedes, and the\r\nsagittal and occipital crests were very prominent; the tympanic bullæ\r\nwere not ossified. The humerus had the epicondylar foramen and the femur\r\nthe third trochanter; in the wrist the scaphoid, lunar and central were\r\nseparate, almost the only important difference from the Fissipedia and\r\nmerely the primitive stage of the latter. The feet were pentadactyl and\r\nthe digits were arranged in spreading fashion; the claws were small,\r\nsharp and partially retractile and the ungual phalanges not cleft at the\r\ntip.\r\n\r\nWithin the family several different phyla may be distinguished, one\r\nof which (_†Miacis_—_†Uintacyon_) led to the dogs, another to the\r\n†bear-dogs, or †amphicyons. A third phylum (_†Didymictis_—_†Viverravus_)\r\nis by several authorities regarded as ancestral to the civet family, or\r\nviverrines, of the Old World, and a fourth (_†Oödectes_, _†Vulpavus_)\r\nas the forerunner of the kinkajous (_Potos_). Except for the connection\r\nwith the dogs, the hiatus in time between the supposed ancestors and\r\ndescendants is too great to permit any confident statements. It seems\r\nvery probable, however, that the †Miacidæ represented the common\r\nstock, from which the fissipede families were all derived, directly or\r\nindirectly, though for most of them the details of the connection remain\r\nto be learned.\r\n\r\nWe find thus a group separating itself from the other †creodonts in the\r\nolder Paleocene and gradually assuming fissipede characteristics, at the\r\nsame time dividing into several phyla. In the upper Eocene this group\r\npassed almost imperceptibly into the Fissipedia, more obviously into\r\nthe dog family, which, as we have seen, represents the central line of\r\nfissipede development.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _†Mesonychidæ_\r\n\r\nThis family displayed, in certain respects, the highest degree of\r\nspecialization attained by any †creodonts, for they were the only\r\nones which acquired cursorial limbs and feet. The †mesonychids were\r\nprevailingly, but not exclusively, a North American family and their\r\nrange in time was through the Paleocene and Eocene.\r\n\r\nThe teeth, in the more advanced genera, had a curious mingling of\r\nprimitive and specialized characters and none were sectorial in the\r\nproper sense of the word. The incisors were small, the canines large\r\nand bear-like and the premolars simple. The upper molars were very\r\nprimitive, retaining the original tritubercular pattern, except that the\r\ntwo outer cusps were joined together, but the lower molars had lost all\r\nthe internal cusps, which gave them a carnassial appearance; they were\r\nnot sectorial, however, for their cusps wore directly against the upper\r\nteeth, not shearing past them, and were greatly blunted and worn down by\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe last of the family was _†Harpagolestes_, of the Uinta and Bridger,\r\none of the largest of the †creodonts. The skull, which was of\r\ndisproportionate size, exceeded that of the Grizzly Bear; the upper\r\nprofile of the skull had considerable resemblance to that of a bear in\r\nthe steep forward descent at the fore head. The teeth were more reduced\r\nthan in the other members of the family through the loss of the second\r\npremolar and third molar of the upper jaw. The skeleton is little known,\r\nbut the humerus had a long and prominent deltoid crest and an epicondylar\r\nforamen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 276.—Upper teeth, right side, of _†Mesonyx\r\nobtusidens_, showing the grinding surface.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle Bridger stage were closely allied and very similar genera,\r\n_†Mesonyx_ and _†Dromocyon_ (Fig. 139, p. 269), which were like small,\r\nbig-headed wolves, for the skull was as long as that of a Black Bear.\r\nThough the cranium was very long, the brain-chamber was very small and\r\nthe sagittal crest enormously high, to afford surface for the attachment\r\nof the powerful jaw-muscles. The tympanic bullæ were ossified and had\r\nquite long, tubular entrances, a feature which has been found in no other\r\n†creodont skull. The face and jaws were also elongate, giving the head\r\nquite a wolf-like appearance. The neck and body were of moderate length,\r\nbut the tail was extremely long, slender and whip-like.\r\n\r\nThe limbs and feet were more specialized than in any other †creodont and\r\nthe changes were all in the direction of adaptation to swift running. The\r\nhumerus was very smooth, with low ridges, and, alone among †creodonts,\r\nhad in these genera no epicondylar foramen, though the femur retained\r\nthe third trochanter. The radius was broad and so interlocked with the\r\nhumerus as to prevent any rotation of the manus. The feet were four-toed\r\nand much resembled those of the modern dogs and hyenas. In each foot\r\nthe metapodials were closely appressed and parallel, not spreading, but\r\narranged in two symmetrical pairs, a longer median and shorter lateral\r\npair, much on the artiodactyl plan; the ankle-bone (astragalus) also\r\nhad an artiodactyl look, with its deeply grooved surface for the tibia\r\nand pulley-like lower end. The ungual phalanges were so short and broad\r\nas almost to suggest hoofs rather than claws. It is clear that the\r\ngait was as fully digitigrade as in a modern wolf and these were the\r\nonly †creodonts of which this is known to be true. These were somewhat\r\npuzzling animals; the whole structure of the limbs and feet was that of\r\ncursorial types, but the broad, blunt claws do not suggest the running\r\ndown and capture of prey, nor were the teeth those of savage killers. The\r\nspeed may have been defensive, to escape from enemies, and the food may\r\nhave been largely vegetable.\r\n\r\nAncestors of these Bridger genera have not been found yet in the Wasatch,\r\na time when the family was represented by _†Pachyæna_, some of the\r\nspecies of which were very large, rivalling _†Harpagolestes_, which was\r\ndescended from one or more of them. _†Pachyæna_ had extremely massive\r\nteeth and was not improbably a carrion-feeder of hyena-like habits, and\r\nit retained the epicondylar foramen of the humerus and pentadactyl feet.\r\n\r\nMuch more primitive was _†Dissacus_, of the upper Paleocene, which was\r\nvery probably the direct ancestor of both the Wasatch and the Bridger\r\ngenera. The upper molars were substantially as in the latter, but the\r\nlower molars had the internal cusp of the primitive triangle, though\r\nthe heel was trenchant, and had lost its inner cusps. The feet had five\r\nwell-developed digits, which were arranged in spreading fashion, and the\r\ngait was plantigrade. The claws were longer, more pointed and much less\r\nhoof-like than in the Bridger genera. The Puerco genus _†Triisodon_ may\r\nor may not have been directly ancestral to _†Dissacus_; at all events, it\r\nwas very nearly what the desired ancestor must have been. The teeth were\r\nmuch less specialized than in _†Dissacus_; the tritubercular upper molars\r\nwere broader and their external cusps were more separated, while in the\r\nlower molars the anterior triangle was made up of three nearly equal\r\ncusps and the heel was low and basin-shaped. The skull had an extremely\r\nnarrow brain-case and a long, heavy sagittal crest.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature in the history of the †Mesonychidæ is the\r\ndemonstrable derivation of the cursorial, digitigrade, four-toed and\r\nalmost hoofed Bridger genera from the plantigrade, five-toed Torrejon\r\ngenus, which had sharp claws. To all appearances, this family was the\r\n†creodont analogue of the hyenas.\r\n\r\n\r\n3, 4. _†Arctocyonidæ and †Oxyclænidæ_\r\n\r\nThis second †creodont family which had no carnassial teeth has received\r\nthe not very happily chosen name of †Arctocyonidæ, or “bear-dogs,” though\r\nthey were not related to either bears or dogs. The family was a very\r\nancient one and has been found only in the Paleocene and lower Eocene\r\n(Torrejon and Wasatch) of North America and Europe. The molar teeth were\r\nvery low-crowned and quadritubercular, with numerous small tubercles in\r\naddition to the four principal cusps, a pattern which was rather pig-like\r\nthan bear-like. The Wasatch genus _†Anacodon_, known only from jaws and\r\nteeth, had reduced premolars, both in size and number, while in the\r\nTorrejon genus, _†Clænodon_, the premolars, though small, were present\r\nin full number. The skull was like that of _†Mesonyx_ in the relative\r\nlengths of cranium and face, the very small size of the brain-case and\r\nthe great prominence of the occipital and sagittal crests. The feet were\r\npentadactyl and plantigrade and the claws were long, thin and pointed,\r\nand the ungual phalanges were not cleft at the tip, the only †creodont\r\nfamily, except the †Miacidæ, of which this was true.\r\n\r\nOf the †Oxyclænidæ, very little is known and they may not have been\r\n†creodonts at all. They were quite small animals, with sharp-cusped\r\ntritubercular upper molars and lower molars with high anterior triangle\r\nand low heel. This is the type of dentition from which all the divergent\r\n†creodont types were doubtless derived. The family was Paleocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _†Hyænodontidæ_\r\n\r\nThis was the last of the †creodont families to survive, being quite\r\ncommon in the lower Oligocene of North America and Europe and in the\r\nupper Eocene of the latter also. The family became extinct in the upper\r\nEocene of North America and the White River genera were not of native\r\norigin, but migrants from the Old World. One of the more abundant\r\npredaceous genera of White River times was the European _†Hyænodon_;\r\nit was represented by several species which ranged in size from a fox\r\nto a Black Bear. In this genus the dentition was somewhat reduced,\r\nthe incisors often numbering 2/2 and the molars constantly 2/3; there\r\nwere three pairs of carnassial teeth on each side, of which the pair\r\nformed by the second upper and third lower molar was the largest and\r\nmost efficient, the other pairs being the first upper and second lower\r\nmolar, the fourth upper premolar and first lower molar, the latter the\r\nsmallest of the three. The upper molars had lost the internal cusp and\r\nthe remaining, external portion consisted of a flattened-conical anterior\r\ncusp and a posterior trenchant ridge; the milk-teeth of _†Hyænodon_, as\r\nwell as the permanent dentition of the ancestral genera, show that the\r\nanterior cusp was composed of the two external cusps of the primitive\r\ntritubercular tooth fused into one and that the trenchant ridge was a\r\nsuperadded element. The fourth upper premolar was a sectorial like that\r\nof the Fissipedia, but of an unfinished, ineffective sort. The third\r\nlower molar was very similar in shape to the carnassial of the cats and\r\nwas composed of only two large, thin and trenchant cusps, which made a\r\nshearing blade, having lost the inner cusp of the primitive triangle and\r\nthe heel. The first and second molars were like the third except in size\r\nand in retaining a vestige of the heel. The premolars were large and\r\nmassive, almost hyena-like, which suggested the generic name. The canines\r\nwere prominent and strong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 277.—_†Hyænodon horridus_, a White River †creodont:\r\nin the background, _†Leptomeryx evansi_. Restored from skeletons in the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nThe skull, as in almost all †creodonts, was relatively very large, but\r\nin the various species there was considerable difference of shape; more\r\ncommonly it was long and narrow, with elongate jaws, and was quite\r\nwolf-like in appearance, but in some of the species it was shorter\r\nand wider. The brain-case was more capacious and the brain more richly\r\nconvoluted than in any other known †creodont, but the sagittal and\r\noccipital crests were very prominent. The neck was rather short, not\r\nequalling the head in length, the body elongate and the loins very\r\nmuscular; the tail was fairly long and thick, but much less so than in\r\nmost †creodonts. The limbs were short and, in most of the species, quite\r\nslender, though in some they were much stouter; the primitive features,\r\nsuch as the third trochanter of the femur, the epicondylar foramen of the\r\nhumerus, the separate scaphoid, lunar and central in the carpus, were\r\nretained. The feet had five digits arranged in spreading fashion and were\r\nprobably semi-digitigrade; the claws were so thick and blunt that they\r\ncould hardly have served in seizing prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 278.—Skeleton of _†Hyænodon_. American Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe restoration gives the animal quite a near resemblance to the modern\r\nhyenas and perhaps errs in making the likeness so close. From the whole\r\nstructure of the skeleton and the form of the claws, it may be inferred\r\nthat _†Hyænodon_ was not a swift runner or very efficient in the capture\r\nof prey. While probably savage fighters, they doubtless subsisted chiefly\r\nas carrion-feeders and scavengers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 279.—Lower teeth, right side, of †hyænodontids. _A_,\r\n_†Sinopa_. _B_, _†Tritemnodon_. _C_, _†Pterodon_. _D_, _†Hyænodon_. _X_,\r\n_Oxyæna_. The dotted line connects the first molar of each, lost in\r\n_†Pterodon_. See explanation of Fig. 280. (After Matthew.)]\r\n\r\nAnother doubtfully distinct genus, _†Hemipsalodon_, was so closely like,\r\nif not identical with, the much better known European _†Pterodon_, that\r\nthe latter may be taken in place of it. _†Pterodon_ was similar in most\r\nrespects to _†Hyænodon_, but distinctly less advanced, and though not\r\nthe ancestor of the latter, serves to connect it with the older members\r\nof the series. _†Pterodon_ did not, so far as we know, penetrate North\r\nAmerica south of the Canadian border, occurring in the lower White River\r\nof Alberta. In this genus the upper molars retained a large internal\r\ncusp, and the third molar, though small and not sectorial, had not\r\nbeen lost; the two external cusps were connate, but not completely\r\nfused together and the posterior ridge was not so well developed as in\r\n_†Hyænodon_, nor was the fourth upper premolar so nearly a carnassial.\r\nThe lower molars were shearing blades, but distinct vestiges of the heel\r\nremained. So far as they are known, the skull and skeleton resembled\r\nthose of _†Hyænodon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 280.—Upper teeth of †hyænodontids, right side,\r\nshowing the grinding surface. _A_, _†Sinopa_, Wasatch and Bridger.\r\n_B_, _†Tritemnodon_, Bridger. _C_, _†Pterodon_, upper Eocene and lower\r\nOligocene of Europe. _D_, _†Hyænodon_, White River. The dotted line\r\nconnects the first molar of each. For comparison is added _X_, _†Oxyæna_,\r\none of the †Oxyænidæ. _C_ and _D_ are much larger than the others, but\r\nall, except _X_, are reduced to the same length. (After Matthew.)]\r\n\r\n_†Hyænodon_ and _†Pterodon_ were evidently derived from a group of small\r\n†creodonts which, in the lower and middle Eocene, were spread all over\r\nthe northern hemisphere, but it is not yet possible to select from the\r\ncrowd of allied genera those which formed the actual steps of descent.\r\nThese small animals were numerous and varied and are far better known\r\nin North America than in Europe and it is not at all improbable that\r\nsome of the lower Eocene genera migrated to the Old World and there gave\r\nrise, among other forms, to _†Hyænodon_ and _†Pterodon_, which eventually\r\nreturned to the land of their earlier ancestry. If confirmed, this will\r\nbe an exceptionally interesting case of back and forth migration. However\r\nthat may be, the American Eocene genera, _†Sinopa_ and _†Tritemnodon_,\r\nillustrate very well the ancestry of the Oligocene genera, as they must\r\nhave been similar to the actual progenitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 281.—_†Tritemnodon agilis_, a primitive †hyænodont,\r\nBridger stage. Restored from a skeleton in the American Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious difference from the Oligocene genera was the\r\nvery much smaller size of the animals, few of the Eocene forms equalling\r\na fox in height. The teeth were unreduced in number, and there were\r\nthree pairs of carnassials. The first and second upper molars were not\r\nfar removed from the primitive tritubercular form, but the two external\r\ncusps were close together and a small posterior cutting ridge was\r\npresent; the third molar was progressively reduced in size. The three\r\nlower molars were carnassials of a rather imperfect kind and the first\r\nwas the smallest of the series; the two outer cusps of the anterior\r\nprimitive triangle formed the shearing blade and there was a basin-shaped\r\nheel. The skull was long, narrow and low and the cranial portion, despite\r\nthe very small brain-case, was especially elongate, though face and jaws\r\nwere also long; the sagittal crest was very prominent. The neck was of\r\nmoderate length, the body long and slender and the tail extremely long.\r\nThe short and delicate limbs were of very primitive character, but\r\nthe radius had already lost the power of rotation; the feet had five\r\nspreading digits, armed with sharp claws. The †hyænodont relationships of\r\nthese small animals are obvious in every part of their structure and yet,\r\nas would be expected, they were far less specialized. Probably, too, they\r\nwere more active and successful hunters of prey, the smaller mammals and\r\nbirds, less given to carrion-feeding. The line probably originated in the\r\n†Oxyclænidæ of the Paleocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _†Oxyænidæ_\r\n\r\nThe genera of this family had such feline characters that more than one\r\nwriter has been misled into the belief that they were the ancestors of\r\nthe cats. In this family there were two pairs of sectorial teeth, of\r\nwhich the larger pair was composed of the first upper and second lower\r\nmolar, the smaller pair of the fourth upper premolar and first lower\r\nmolar, as in the fissipedes. Of the three phyla within the family, the\r\nmost specialized one ran a brief career, through the Wasatch, Wind River\r\nand Bridger, and then died out. The terminal member of this series, the\r\nBridger genus _†Patriofelis_, had a skull as large as that of a lion,\r\nbut the rest of the skeleton was not so large in proportion. The teeth\r\nwere considerably reduced in number, the formula being: _i_ ?/2, _c_\r\n1/1, _p_ 3/3, _m_ 1/2, a loss of at least twelve from the primitive total\r\nof 44. The single upper molar was a large sectorial, which was formed\r\nmuch as in the †hyænodonts, the two external cusps connate, but not\r\nindistinguishably fused together, and a long, trenchant ridge behind,\r\nwhile the inner cusp had almost vanished. The second lower molar was very\r\ncat-like; its cutting blade was formed of two shearing cusps; of the\r\ninner cusp no trace was left, and of the heel merely a vestige. The first\r\nlower molar was smaller and less specialized, since it retained a small\r\ninternal cusp and quite a large heel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 282.—_†Patriofelis ferox_, Bridger stage. Restored\r\nfrom a skeleton in the American Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe skull was very large and massive, with elongate cranium and\r\nshortened face, the muzzle broad and abruptly truncate, not tapering;\r\nthe brain-case was exceedingly small, with very long and prominent\r\nsagittal crest; the zygomatic arches were extremely heavy and curved\r\noutward boldly, so that the head was very wide, notwithstanding the\r\nabsurdly small brain-case. The lower jaw was very deep and heavy and\r\nthe chin abruptly rounded, with almost vertical front. The very unusual\r\nmassiveness of the zygomatic arches and the great development of the\r\ncrests and ridges for the attachment of the jaw-muscles, and the short,\r\nheavy lower jaw, all indicate a degree of power in the biting and\r\nshearing apparatus such as occurred in no other known †creodont.\r\n\r\nThe neck was of medium length, while the body, though actually elongate,\r\nwas rather short as compared with most other †creodonts; the loins were\r\nvery heavy and must have been extremely powerful in the living animal;\r\nin this region the articulations between the successive vertebræ were\r\nmore complex than in any other member of the suborder; resembling the\r\nstructure found in certain artiodactyls. The ribs were long and thick,\r\nthe chest deep and capacious. Even for a †creodont, the tail was long and\r\nuncommonly thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 283.—Right pes of _†Patriofelis ferox_. _Cal._,\r\ncalcaneum. _As._, astragalus. _Cb._, cuboid. _N._, navicular. _Cn. 1, 2,\r\n3_, internal, middle and external cuneiforms. (After Wortman.)]\r\n\r\nThe limbs, especially the anterior pair, were short and very stout; the\r\nhumerus had an immensely developed deltoid ridge, which extended down for\r\ntwo-thirds the length of the shaft, and a very prominent supinator ridge;\r\nthe fore-arm bones, particularly the ulna, were heavy and the radius had\r\nbut a limited power of rotation. The feet were short and broad, with five\r\ncomplete, spreading toes, ending in thick and blunt-pointed claws.\r\n\r\n_†Patriofelis_ was by far the most formidable of the Bridger Carnivora\r\nand, with the exception of _†Harpagolestes_, the largest. Its appearance\r\nmust have been very curious, judged from the modern standpoint, with its\r\ndisproportionately large, broad and rounded, leonine head, thick body\r\nand long, extremely heavy tail. The short, powerful limbs and broad feet\r\nmust have given it something of the appearance of an otter. As in the\r\ncase of so many other †creodonts, the combination of characters in the\r\nskeleton makes the question of habits a very puzzling one. The teeth\r\nhad a form suited only to seizing and devouring prey, but the short\r\nlegs and feet were not at all adapted to the swift movements, whether\r\nby long-continued running, or by stealthy approach and sudden leap,\r\nwhich are required in capturing agile prey, while the blunt claws could\r\nhave rendered no service in holding a struggling creature. The form of\r\nthe humerus and fore foot suggests burrowing habits, but it seems most\r\nunlikely that so large an animal could have lived in any such fashion.\r\nTerrestrial, arboreal and aquatic modes of life have all been suggested,\r\nand, all things considered, perhaps the least improbable conclusion is\r\nthat _†Patriofelis_ was more or less aquatic and preyed chiefly upon\r\nthe fishes and turtles with which the Bridger waters abounded. This\r\nhypothesis of Dr. Wortman’s is supported by the otter-like form of the\r\nanimal. Whatever the principal kind of food was, it must have been\r\nsomething that greatly abraded the teeth, which in old animals were mere\r\nstumps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 284.—_†Oxyæna lupina_, Wasatch stage. Restored from a\r\nskeleton in the American Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe Wind River representatives of the series are known only from\r\nfragments, which, so far as they go, are not separable from\r\n_†Patriofelis_. On the other hand, the Wasatch genus, _†Oxyæna_, is\r\nfairly well understood. This genus was very like its Bridger successor,\r\nbut differed from it in just such ways as would be expected in an\r\nimmediately ancestral form, that is to say, in smaller size and less\r\nadvanced specialization. The number of teeth was not so far diminished:\r\n_i_ 3/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 4/4, _m_ 2/2, × 2 = 40; the carnassial teeth were\r\nthe same, but they were less effective; the fourth upper premolar\r\nand first upper molar had large inner cusps, and in the latter the\r\npostero-external trenchant ridge was shorter. The second upper molar,\r\nlacking in _†Patriofelis_, was a transversely placed ridge, which\r\nengaged the heel of the second lower molar. The latter tooth, though\r\nlarger than the first molar, was much less completely trenchant than in\r\n_†Patriofelis_ and retained a small internal cusp and quite large heel.\r\nThe skull resembled that of the Bridger genus, but the face was not so\r\nmuch shortened, the zygomatic arches were not so widely expanded or so\r\nmassive, the lower jaw was not so heavy, nor the chin so steep. The body\r\nwas relatively longer and more slender, the ribs being thinner and the\r\nchest shallower; the tail was even longer, but not nearly so thick. The\r\narticulations of the lumbar vertebræ were less complex. Except for their\r\ngreater length and slenderness the limbs and feet were nearly identical\r\nwith those of _†Patriofelis_.\r\n\r\nIn appearance, _†Oxyæna_ must have been merely a smaller, lighter and\r\nless powerful variant of the Bridger genus, and, no doubt, its habits\r\nof life were substantially the same; but in the details of structure\r\nwere many minor differences, all of them in the direction of greater\r\nprimitiveness in the more ancient animal.\r\n\r\nThe second phylum of the family was represented in the Uinta and Bridger\r\nstages by a group of small species, which were survivors of still more\r\nancient and primitive progenitors of the family. In the typical genus,\r\n_†Limnocyon_, the dental formula was the same as in _†Oxyæna_: _i_ 3/3,\r\n_c_ 1/1, _p_ 4/4, _m_ 2/2, but the first upper molar had its two external\r\ncusps well separated and a much lower posterior cutting ridge, while the\r\ninner cusp was much larger. The second upper molar, though transversely\r\nplaced, had all the elements of the primitive tritubercular tooth, the\r\npattern from which all the varied types of †creodont upper molars were\r\nderived by the addition or suppression of parts. The two lower molars\r\nwere very primitive, having a high anterior triangle of three cusps,\r\nforming an imperfect shearing blade, and a low heel. This dentition was\r\non nearly the same plan as that of the small, contemporary †hyænodonts,\r\nbut the emphasis of development, so to speak, was differently placed.\r\nIn the †hyænodonts there were three pairs of sectorials and the\r\nbest-developed pair was made up of the second upper and third lower\r\nmolar; while in _†Limnocyon_ the third molar was lost, and there were but\r\ntwo pairs of sectorials, of which the largest pair was the first upper\r\nand second lower molar, as was also true of _†Oxyæna_ and _†Patriofelis_.\r\n\r\nThe skull of _†Limnocyon_ had a much longer facial region, and more\r\nelongate and slender jaws than in the last-named genera, and the feet\r\nmust have been quite different, with less spreading digits. _†Limnocyon_\r\nthus tends to indicate a common origin for the †oxyænids and †hyænodonts,\r\nthough these common ancestors are still unknown.\r\n\r\nA very interesting genus of this series, _†Machairoides_, of the\r\nBridger, shows another imitation of the cats, the flanges of the lower\r\njaw indicating sabre-like upper canines.\r\n\r\nAnother genus, _†Palæonictis_, of the Wasatch, found also in France,\r\nis sometimes referred to the †Oxyænidæ and sometimes made the type of\r\na distinct family, but is too incompletely known for final reference.\r\nIt had the same number of teeth as _†Oxyæna_, but the principal pair\r\nof carnassials was the fourth upper premolar and first lower molar, as\r\nin the Fissipedia, the first upper and second lower molar forming the\r\nsubsidiary pair. The first upper molar was hardly sectorial at all; its\r\ntwo outer cusps were long, sharp-pointed cones, and the posterior cutting\r\nridge was a mere tubercle. The skull had a short, cat-like face. The\r\ngenus left no successors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis concludes the long story of the Carnivora, so far as it has been\r\nrecovered from the rocks. Incomplete as it is, and full of unsolved\r\nproblems, it yet enables us to follow, somewhat vaguely, but with a\r\ngeneral kind of accuracy, the development of the various modifications\r\nwhich characterized the different families and genera of the group.\r\n\r\nThe more ancient and primitive suborder, the †Creodonta, made its first\r\nrecorded appearance in the lower Paleocene and was, no doubt, derived\r\nfrom Mesozoic ancestors, which cannot yet be distinguished among the\r\nvery imperfectly understood mammals of that era. In the upper Paleocene,\r\nif not before, the †creodonts had spread over the northern hemisphere\r\nand had begun to diverge into a number of families, which continued to\r\ndiverge more and more widely throughout the Eocene epoch, as they became\r\nmore specialized and adapted to different habits of life. From the most\r\nprimitive group, represented more or less accurately by the †Oxyclænidæ,\r\nmay be traced the several lines of diverging adaptations incorporated in\r\nthe various families, some of which had become distinctly recognizable\r\nin the lower Paleocene, others in the upper, while all were in existence\r\nin the lower Eocene. In one series, the †Mesonychidæ, the upper teeth\r\nunderwent comparatively little change, while the lower ones lost the\r\ninner cusps, but no carnassials were formed. The face and jaws were\r\nelongated and the limbs and feet became adapted to cursorial habits, and\r\nthe more advanced genera had four-toed, completely digitigrade feet,\r\nwith blunt, almost hoof-like claws. A second series, the †Arctocyonidæ,\r\nlikewise failed to develop sectorial teeth, the molars becoming\r\nquadritubercular, with many accessory tubercles, and assuming a bear-like\r\nor pig-like pattern, while the premolars were reduced in size. The\r\npentadactyl feet had sharp claws.\r\n\r\nIn the †Oxyænidæ two pairs of carnassial teeth were formed, of which the\r\nlarger and more effective pair were the first upper and second lower\r\nmolar, the smaller pair the fourth upper premolar and first lower molar.\r\nThe teeth were diminished in number, first by the loss of the last molar,\r\nthen the suppression of the first premolar and finally by that of the\r\nthird incisor and second upper molar; the remaining teeth were enlarged.\r\nThe upper carnassial molar (the first) was formed by the approximation\r\nand partial fusion of the two external cusps and the addition of a\r\ntrenchant ridge behind these, and by the reduction and eventual loss of\r\nthe internal cusp, thus becoming more exclusively shearing in function.\r\nThe second lower molar also lost the inner cusp and the heel, becoming\r\nremarkably cat-like in form; the first was similar, but less simplified.\r\nThe face and jaws were greatly shortened, which, with the widely expanded\r\nzygomatic arches, gave the head a very cat-like appearance. The body and\r\ntail were long, the limbs short and thick, and the feet had spreading\r\ntoes and blunt claws. Save for a notable increase in size and muscular\r\npower, the †oxyænids showed but little change within the family.\r\n\r\nThe †Hyænodontidæ differed from the †oxyænids in the retention of\r\nall or nearly all the teeth and in having three pairs of sectorials,\r\nof which the largest pair was the second upper and third lower\r\nmolar, but resembled them in the mode of forming these sectorials\r\nand in the cat-like form of the inferior ones. Although the\r\nactual line of descent was not through these genera, the series,\r\n_†Sinopa_—_†Tritemnodon_—_†Pterodon_—_†Hyænodon_, extending from the\r\nlower Eocene into the Oligocene, displays perfectly the successive steps\r\nin the transformation of the teeth. The skull underwent a corresponding\r\nseries of changes, ending in long-faced, long-jawed, wolf-like forms,\r\nwith larger brain-case than in any other †creodonts. The elongated form\r\nof body was retained, but the tail was reduced to moderate proportions.\r\nThe limbs and feet did not change greatly, except in size and in the\r\ngreater bluntness of the claws.\r\n\r\nThe †Miacidæ, if not actually referable to the Fissipedia, at least\r\nanticipated them in the mode of carnassial development. The upper molars\r\nchanged very little from the primitive tritubercular plan, but the fourth\r\nupper premolar was enlarged and acquired a trenchant ridge behind the\r\noriginal single outer cusp. The lower molars were at first all alike,\r\nexcept in size, the first being the largest; they had the primitive\r\npattern common to the earlier members of nearly all the †creodont\r\nfamilies, of an elevated anterior triangle of three subequal cusps and\r\nlow, basin-like heel. The first molar grew larger in the successive\r\ngenera and, by the enlargement of the two external cusps of the primitive\r\ntriangle and reduction of the inner one, gradually became an efficient\r\nsectorial, the fourth upper premolar keeping pace with it. In proportion\r\nas the first lower molar was elaborated, the second and third were\r\nreduced in size and the anterior triangle was lowered to the level of the\r\nheel, these teeth thus becoming tubercular. All the †Miacidæ were small\r\nanimals, none attaining the stature of a fox, though some had heads as\r\nlarge. From this family, as was pointed out above, probably arose all of\r\nthe Fissipedia, the history of which it is needless to repeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE PRIMATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis order embraces the lemurs, monkeys, man-like apes and Man, though in\r\nthe general account Man will be omitted from consideration. The Primates\r\nare clothed in dense fur or shaggy hair. The teeth are always low-crowned\r\nand rooted and reduced in number, the incisors generally to 2/2 and the\r\npremolars to 3/3-2/2; the molars are trituberculate or quadrituberculate.\r\nThe cranium is unusually capacious and the orbit is entirely encircled\r\nin bone. The tail varies much in length and may be entirely wanting.\r\nThe bones of the fore-arm and lower leg are separate and the radius has\r\nmuch freedom of rotation, in correspondence with the grasping power of\r\nthe hand. The pes is also a grasping organ and, with few exceptions,\r\nthe thumb and great toe are opposable to the other digits; the bones\r\nof the wrist do not coössify and frequently the central is present.\r\nThe feet are plantigrade and almost always pentadactyl and, with a few\r\nexceptions, have neither claws nor hoofs, but flat nails; the ungual\r\nphalanges are correspondingly modified and do not taper toward the free\r\nend, but expand at the tip. The Primates are characteristically arboreal\r\nin habit, but a few, such as the baboons, have become secondarily adapted\r\nto a terrestrial mode of life. They inhabit at present all the tropical\r\nregions of both hemispheres, Australia excepted. Extra-tropical North\r\nAmerica has no existing member of the order and, so far as we know, has\r\nhad none since the Eocene epoch. The most important of the genera of the\r\nwestern hemisphere are listed below.\r\n\r\n  Suborder LEMUROIDEA. Lemurs\r\n\r\n    I. †NOTHARCTIDÆ.\r\n\r\n        _†Pelycodus_, low. and mid.

LEMURS\r\n\r\nThe name _Lemur_, which Linnæus gave to a genus of this suborder,\r\nsignifies in Latin a spectre or ghost and was probably suggested by the\r\nvery strange appearance and nocturnal habits of these curious creatures.\r\nThe term has been adopted as the English name for the group, as there\r\nwas no vernacular word for it. The lemurs are very obviously the more\r\nprimitive division of the Primates. Omitting for the present the extinct\r\nforms, the dental formula is usually: _i_ 2/2, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 3/3, _m_\r\n3/3, × 2 = 36; the upper canine is a long, sharp, dagger-like tooth,\r\nbut the lower one, in nearly all of the genera, is like an incisor and\r\nits place is taken by the anterior premolar; the premolars are simple,\r\ncompressed and trenchant and the upper molars tritubercular. The skull\r\nusually has a long and tapering facial portion, so that the living head\r\nhas some resemblance to that of a raccoon. The orbits almost always have\r\na more or less lateral presentation, instead of being directed forward,\r\nas they are in the Anthropoidea; they are encircled in bone, but are not\r\nwalled in by a bony funnel; the lachrymal bone is extended on the face\r\nand the foramen is outside of the orbit. The hind legs are longer than\r\nthe fore; the humerus retains the epicondylar foramen and the femur has\r\na third trochanter; the feet are plantigrade, almost always five-toed,\r\nwith opposable thumb and great toe, and having a varying proportion of\r\nflat nails and sharp claws. The brain is of a primitive type and not much\r\nconvoluted.\r\n\r\nAll the existing and most of the fossil lemurs are small animals, some\r\nquite minute, and only in the Pleistocene of Madagascar have large ones\r\nbeen found. They are chiefly nocturnal and arboreal in habits, and\r\nfeed upon fruit and leaves, but vary their diet with insects, small\r\nreptiles, birds and eggs. Their present geographical distribution is very\r\nremarkable; more than two-thirds of the existing species are confined\r\nto Madagascar; the others are in tropical Africa, southern Asia and the\r\nAsiatic islands, as far east as Celebes and the Philippines. In the\r\nEocene epoch they extended all over the northern hemisphere, but have not\r\nbeen found in any subsequent formation outside of their present range.\r\n\r\nLemurs occurred in the Uinta stage, but were much more abundant in the\r\nBridger, of which the best-known genus is _†Notharctus_. These Eocene\r\nforms did not have the aberrant peculiarities of the modern lemurs, but\r\ndeparted less from the primitive stock common to both of the suborders.\r\nIn _†Notharctus_ the dental formula was: _i_ 2/2, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 4/4,\r\n_m_ 3/3, × 2 = 40, the dentition being reduced only to the extent of\r\nlosing one incisor on each side above and below; the lower canine was\r\nnot incisiform nor had the anterior premolar taken its place; the upper\r\nmolars were quadritubercular, and in the lower ones the anterior triangle\r\nwas hardly higher than the heel. The two halves of the lower jaw were\r\ncoössified at the symphysis, and the femur had lost the third trochanter.\r\nIt is not likely that _†Notharctus_ was ancestral to any of the existing\r\nlemurs, but may have been to the numerous forms of the European upper\r\nEocene.\r\n\r\nThe Wasatch genera are known from very fragmentary material, but it\r\nsuffices to show that some of the genera, at least (_e.g._ _†Pelycodus_),\r\nwere decidedly more primitive than those of the Bridger. The incisors had\r\nalready been reduced to 2/2, the well-nigh universal formula among the\r\nPrimates; the upper molars were tritubercular, but with a minute fourth\r\ncusp beginning to appear, and in the lower molars the anterior triangle\r\nwas elevated above the heel. The two halves of the lower jaw were\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\nThe Paleocene has yielded nothing that can be positively referred to\r\nthe Primates, but there was a group of genera (_e.g._ _†Indrodon_),\r\nknown only from jaws and teeth, which have been variously assigned to\r\nthe lemurs and the Insectivora and may have belonged to either order,\r\nor have represented the transition between them. This very uncertainty\r\nis in itself a significant fact, for it is another of the many examples\r\nof the way in which, at that early period, the mammalian orders were so\r\napproximated that it is often very difficult to distinguish them.\r\n\r\nIt was stated above that the distinction between existing lemurs and\r\nanthropoids was a very clear one, but to this statement there is one\r\npartial exception. The curious little Tarsier (_Tarsius spectrum_), an\r\nanimal about the size of the Grey Squirrel, an inhabitant of the Malay\r\nArchipelago, is thus described by Mr. Beddard: “The ears are large and\r\nthe eyes are extraordinarily developed. The fingers and toes terminate\r\nin large, expanded disks and are furnished with flattened nails, except\r\non the second and third toes, which have claws. The tail is longer\r\nthan the body and tufted at the end.... The Tarsiers are nocturnal and\r\nparticularly arboreal; they live in pairs, in holes in tree stems and\r\nare mainly insectivorous in their food.... Like so many Lemurs, this\r\nanimal is held in superstitious dread, which is the result of its most\r\nweird appearance.”[13] The skull is more anthropoid in character than is\r\nthat of any other lemur, the face being greatly shortened, the cranium\r\nenlarged and the orbit not merely encircled in a bony rim, but with a\r\nthin posterior wall of bone. There are also structural features in the\r\nsoft parts, which are more anthropoid than lemuroid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 285.—Head of monkey-like lemur (_†Anaptomorphus\r\nhomunculus_) from the Wasatch. Restored from a skull in the American\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nThe particular interest which _Tarsius_ possesses for the student\r\nof American mammals is its resemblance to the Wasatch genus\r\n_†Anaptomorphus_, the type of a family which was abundant and varied in\r\nthe lower and middle Eocene. This genus was remarkably advanced in view\r\nof its great antiquity. The dental formula was: _i_ 2/2, _c_ 1/1, _p_\r\n3/3-2, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 34-36; in the upper jaw the premolars were bicuspid\r\nand the molars tritubercular, while the lower premolars were simple. The\r\nface was very much shortened; the orbits were very large and encircled in\r\nbone, but without the posterior wall. This produces a decided likeness to\r\nthe Tarsier and is no doubt indicative of nocturnal habits. The cranium\r\nwas remarkably large, and no other Wasatch animal had a brain-case\r\nso capacious in proportion to its size. A lemurine character was the\r\nposition of the lachrymal foramen outside of the orbit. The two halves\r\nof the lower jaw were separate. It is hardly likely that these American\r\nlemurs were the actual ancestors of the anthropoids, but they closely\r\nrepresent what those ancestors must have been.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ANTHROPOIDEA. MONKEYS, APES, MAN\r\n\r\nThe specifically human characters will be omitted in defining the\r\nsuborder. The Anthropoidea are plantigrade, usually arboreal and\r\npentadactyl, with opposable thumb and great toe and thus the pes is\r\nlike a hand, hence the term “Quadrumana” formerly given to the apes and\r\nmonkeys. Except in the South American marmosets (Hapalidæ) all of the\r\ndigits have nails. The canines are generally more or less tusk-like,\r\nprojecting above (or below) the level of the other teeth; the premolars\r\nmostly have two tubercles, like the human bicuspids, the upper molars\r\nhave three, or more commonly four, cusps and the lower, four or five.\r\nSave in the baboons, the skull has a very short muzzle and a very large\r\ncranium, the capacity of which is relatively greatest in the large apes;\r\nthe brain is large and complexly convoluted. The orbits present directly\r\nforward and are deep, funnel-shaped cavities for the lodgment of the\r\neyeballs, a thin bony wall completely enclosing them externally and\r\nposteriorly. The lachrymal bone and its foramen are within the edge of\r\nthe orbit; the nasal bones are short and have a nearly vertical position.\r\nThe two frontal bones are early fused into one and usually there is no\r\nsagittal crest; the two halves of the lower jaw are coössified at the\r\nsymphysis. The tail is extremely variable in length and may be three\r\ntimes as long as the body, or entirely absent. The fore and hind legs are\r\nsometimes of nearly equal length, but far more frequently the anterior\r\npair are much the longer. The length of the legs in proportion to that of\r\nthe body is very different in the different families. The humerus is much\r\nlike that of Man and has no epicondylar foramen; the radius has a very\r\ncomplete movement of rotation; the femur never has the third trochanter\r\nand the lower leg bones are always separate. The thumb is more or less\r\nopposable to the other digits, except in the marmosets, but never so\r\nperfectly as in Man; the great toe is also opposable, but shorter than\r\nthe other digits.\r\n\r\nThe Anthropoidea are divisible into two sections, the Catarrhina,\r\ncharacteristic of the Old World, and the Platyrrhina, confined to the\r\nNew. In the Catarrhina, or Old World apes and monkeys, the dental formula\r\nis the same as in Man: _i_ 2/2, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 2/2, _m_ 3/3, × 2 = 32;\r\nthe nostrils are close together and the tympanic bullæ have tubular\r\nentrances. Many, but not all, have cheek-pouches opening into the mouth.\r\nThe tail is never prehensile and, except in most of the large, man-like\r\napes (Simiidæ), there are naked callosities on the buttocks. With these\r\nOld World forms we have no further concern, though it may be noted in\r\npassing that Dr. Schlosser has discovered in the Oligocene of Egypt\r\ncertain monkeys (_†Parapithecus_) which he thus describes: “The number\r\nand structure of the teeth, character of the jaws and bodily size make\r\ncomplete the transition from the Anaptomorphids and Tarsiids to the\r\nSimiids.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Section Platyrrhina. South American Monkeys_\r\n\r\nIn these animals the nostrils are separated by a broad septum, and\r\nthere are always three premolars above and below (_p_ 3/3). The tail\r\nis frequently prehensile and serves as a fifth limb, being capable of\r\nsupporting the whole weight of the body. There are no cheek-pouches and\r\nno callosities, and the tympanic bullæ have no bony tubes leading into\r\nthem. The thumb is but partially, or not at all, opposable and in some\r\ngenera is absent.\r\n\r\nThe New World monkeys are, in general, smaller and lighter than those\r\nof the eastern hemisphere; there are no very large ones and they are\r\nall arboreal and are confined to the forested parts of the Neotropical\r\nregion, except the West Indies, which have none. The marmosets\r\n(Hapalidæ), the first of the two families into which the Platyrrhina\r\nare divided, are little creatures, no longer than squirrels, with long,\r\nnon-prehensile tails. They are characterized by the dental formula: _i_\r\n2/2, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 3/3, _m_ 2/2, × 2 = 32, and are the only Primates which\r\nhave no third molar above or below. The thumb is not opposable, though\r\nquite long, and the hallux, or great toe, is very small; they are thus\r\ndeficient in grasping power. Instead of the flat nails common to all the\r\nother Anthropoidea, they have long, sharp claws. All other South American\r\nmonkeys are included in the family Cebidæ which, in turn, is divided into\r\nfour subfamilies. It is not necessary to consider these or do more than\r\ncite a few illustrative examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 286.—Common Marmoset (_Hapale_).—By permission of W.\r\nL. Berridge, London.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 287.—Sapajou (_Cebus_).—By permission of the New York\r\nZoölogical Society.]\r\n\r\nSome twenty species of the genus _Cebus_ are distributed from Central\r\nAmerica to Paraguay; they have long, prehensile tails completely covered\r\nwith hair, and well-developed thumbs. The monkeys of this genus are\r\nfamiliar to every one, as they are largely used by organ-grinders. The\r\nspider-monkeys (_Ateles_) are so called because of the great length\r\nand slenderness of their limbs; the tail is very long and perfectly\r\nprehensile, naked on the lower side near the end, which improves its\r\ngrasping power. The hand has lost the thumb, but is used very effectively\r\nas a hook. The species, ten or more in number, have a wider range than\r\nthose of _Cebus_ and extend from Uruguay to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe howling monkeys (_Alouatta_, more commonly, but improperly, called\r\n_Mycetes_) are gifted with most unusual vocal powers. Mr. Bates says of\r\nthem: “Morning and evening the howling monkeys make a most fearful and\r\nharrowing roar.” “The brief evening chorus of animals then began, the\r\nchief performers being the howling monkeys, whose frightful unearthly\r\nroar deepened the feeling of solitude which crept on as darkness closed\r\naround us.”[14] The tremendous volume of sound which these small\r\ncreatures are able to produce is due to a resonating apparatus, formed by\r\nthe great inflation of one of the hyoid bones (see p. 67), normally the\r\nbony support of the tongue. The tail is long and prehensile, with the end\r\nnaked beneath; the thumb is well developed.\r\n\r\nThe sakis (_Pithecia_) have long and non-prehensile tail and complete\r\nthumb. The species of this genus have a remarkable kind of distribution,\r\nwhich is rare among mammals, though not infrequent for insects and birds.\r\nEach species is limited to a definite area of forest along the Amazon and\r\nits tributaries, which it occupies to the exclusion of the others. The\r\nuakaris (_Cacajao_) are distinguished by the tail, which is much shorter\r\nthan in any other of the Cebidæ.\r\n\r\nFinally, may be mentioned the nocturnal douroucoulis (_Nyctipithecus_),\r\nwhich have long, non-prehensile tail and well-developed thumb. Mr. Bates\r\ndescribes them thus: “A third interesting genus of monkeys, found near\r\nEga, are the Nyctipitheci, or night apes, called Ei-á by the Indians....\r\nThey sleep all day long in hollow trees and come forth to prey on insects\r\nand eat fruits only at night. They are of small size, the body being\r\nabout a foot long and the tail fourteen inches, and are thickly clothed\r\nwith soft gray and brown fur, ... and the eyes are large and yellowish\r\nin colour, imparting the staring expression of nocturnal animals of\r\nprey.”[15]\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian caverns have preserved the remains of many Pleistocene\r\nmonkeys belonging to existing South American genera, and even several\r\nmodern species are represented, while others are extinct. There is also\r\none extinct genus (_†Eriodes_), a larger animal than any of the existing\r\nNeotropical monkeys. The Pampean deposits of Argentina, on the other\r\nhand, have yielded no remains of Primates, nor is this surprising, for\r\nthe Pampas would seem to have been open plains in the Pleistocene, as\r\nthey are to-day. Between the Pleistocene and the Santa Cruz Miocene\r\nthere is a long gap in the history. It is true that some bones have been\r\nfound in the Pliocene of Monte Hermoso which have been referred to the\r\nPrimates, but they are too few and imperfect to be of any real assistance\r\nin the inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn the Santa Cruz beds fossil monkeys are very rare, but that they were\r\npresent in Patagonia at all, is strong evidence that the climate was then\r\nfar milder than it is at present. These were essentially members of the\r\nmodern family Cebidæ. The best-known genus, _†Homunculus_, retained a few\r\nprimitive characters, which the existing genera have lost. For example,\r\nthe premolars were relatively smaller and of simpler form and the humerus\r\nhad the epicondylar foramen, though the femur no longer had the third\r\ntrochanter. The radius was very modern in form and evidently could rotate\r\nfreely upon the humerus.\r\n\r\nNo monkeys have been found in the Deseado formation, though too much\r\nstress should not be laid upon this fact, because of the general scarcity\r\nof small animals in those beds. But the same is true of the still more\r\nancient stages; despite an abundant and varied fauna of small mammals,\r\nthey have yielded no Primates, nor anything which could be seriously\r\nregarded as ancestral to them. The facts are essentially the same as we\r\nhave found them to be with reference to the South American rodents and\r\ninsectivores. All three of these orders appeared suddenly and unheralded\r\nin the Deseado (Rodentia) or Santa Cruz (Insectivora, Primates), and all\r\nof them were allied to African or European rather than to North American\r\ntypes. If we may assume the existence of a land-connection with Africa\r\nto account for the remarkable distribution of the hystricomorph rodents,\r\nthe same connection will equally well explain the introduction of the\r\nPrimates into South America.\r\n\r\nConcerning the relations of the Old and New World monkeys, Mr. Beddard\r\nremarks: “Not only are these two groups of the Primates absolutely\r\ndistinct at the present day, but they have been, so far as we know,\r\nfor a very long time, since no fossil remains of Monkeys at all\r\nintermediate have been so far discovered. This has led to the suggestion\r\nthat the Monkeys are what is termed diphyletic, _i.e._, that they have\r\noriginated from two different stocks of ancestors. It is hard, however,\r\nto understand on this view the very great similarities which underlie\r\nthe divergences that have just been mentioned. But, on the other hand,\r\nit is equally hard to understand how it is that, having been separated\r\nfrom each other for so long a period, they have not diverged further in\r\nstructure than they have.”[16]\r\n\r\nThe fossil monkeys of the Santa Cruz beds show that, as a matter of\r\nfact, the South American Primates have undergone little change in the\r\nessentials of structure since that remote period, and thus is removed\r\nthis objection to the conclusion that the Platyrrhina and Catarrhina\r\nwere derived from a common ancestry. In a certain sense also, the\r\ndiscovery of _†Parapithecus_ in Egypt has diminished the gap between\r\nthese two sections of the Anthropoidea. The evidence, though by no means\r\nconclusive, is distinctly in favour of the derivation of the South\r\nAmerican monkeys from Old World ancestors. The Catarrhina have developed\r\nand advanced from the point of divergence far more than have the South\r\nAmerican forms, which have changed relatively little since their invasion\r\nof the Neotropical region. So far as has been ascertained, South America\r\nnever had any of the lemurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE\r\n\r\nThough to most people this is undoubtedly the most interesting chapter\r\nof all the mammalian history, little space can be given to it here, for\r\nthe reason that the subject belongs rather in the domain of Anthropology\r\nand Ethnology than in that of Palæontology. There can be no question that\r\nMan originated in the eastern hemisphere and at a very remote period;\r\nabundant remains of his handiwork and of himself have been found in\r\nEurope as far back as the early Pleistocene, and recent discoveries in\r\nEngland have increased the already known length of the human habitation\r\nof Europe. So primitive and ape-like were some of these ancient men\r\nthat they have been named as species (_Homo †neanderthalensis_ and _H.\r\n†heidelbergensis_) distinct from the existing _H. sapiens_. Recently\r\ndiscovered and very ancient remains in England have even been referred to\r\na separate genus, _†Eoanthropus_.\r\n\r\nAs has been repeatedly pointed out in the preceding chapters, America\r\nreceived numerous successive waves of mammalian immigrants during the\r\nPleistocene epoch, at a time when there was a broad land-connection\r\nbetween North America and Asia, where now is Bering Strait; and to this\r\nlate connection is due the fact that the Boreal zone of North America\r\n(see p. 150) is zoölogically a part of the Old World and forms a division\r\nof the Holarctic region. Now, there is no known reason why Man, whose\r\npowers of dispersal are so superior to those of any other mammal, should\r\nnot have accompanied these migrations, and it is entirely possible that\r\nhe actually did so, but the fact has not been demonstrated. It is true\r\nthat discoveries of Pleistocene Man have been frequently reported from\r\nboth North and South America, but these have not stood the test of\r\ncritical examination, though such examination has by no means disproved\r\nthe presence of Pleistocene Man in America.\r\n\r\nDr. A. Hrdlička has recently concluded a series of exhaustive studies\r\nof the bones of early Man in both North and South America and of the\r\nlocalities where these bones were found. For both continents he has\r\nreached a negative result. As to North America he says: “Thus far on\r\nthis continent no human bones of undisputed geologic antiquity are\r\nknown.”[17] For South America the result is the same. “A conscientious,\r\nunbiased study of all the available facts has shown that the whole\r\nstructure erected in support of the theory of geologically ancient man\r\non that continent rests on very imperfect and incorrectly interpreted\r\ndata and in many instances on false premises, and as a consequence of\r\nthese weaknesses must completely collapse when subjected to searching\r\ncriticism.” “The conclusions of the writers with regard to the evidence\r\nthus far furnished are that it fails to establish the claim that in South\r\nAmerica there have been brought forth thus far tangible traces of either\r\ngeologically ancient man himself or any precursor of the human race.\r\n\r\n“This should not be taken as a categorical denial of the existence of\r\nearly man in South America, however improbable such a presence may now\r\nappear.”[18]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the coexistence in North America of Man with several\r\nextinct species of mammals has been made extremely probable, if not\r\ncertain. One of the most striking and best authenticated cases of this\r\nwas the discovery by Professor Williston in western Kansas of a flint\r\narrowhead beneath and in contact with the skeleton of the extinct _Bison\r\n†occidentalis_. Professor Russell found in lake deposits of Nevada an\r\nobsidian spear-head in association with the bones of an elephant or\r\n†mastodon, and other such instances have been reported. In these cases\r\nthe doubt is as to the geological antiquity of the “finds,” for the\r\nimplements are of the type made by the pre-Columbian Indians.\r\n\r\nIn brief, there is no convincing evidence that either North or South\r\nAmerica was ever inhabited in prehistoric times by races of men different\r\nfrom those first encountered by the European discoverers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE EDENTATA\r\n\r\n\r\nAs here employed, excluding the so-called edentates of the Old World, the\r\nEdentata form a highly variegated, but natural, assemblage of related\r\nforms. The order is at present exclusively American and almost confined\r\nto the Neotropical region, an armadillo which extends into Texas being\r\nthe sole exception. These animals are so peculiar and so isolated from\r\nother mammals, that it has been proposed to treat them as a separate\r\nsubclass; and there is much to be said in favour of this procedure,\r\nthough it would perhaps be premature, until more is learned concerning\r\nthese most curious and exceptional animals.

Almost all the genera have no teeth in\r\nthe front of the mouth and the teeth are nearly always alike, so that\r\nthe distinction of regions among them is entirely a matter of position\r\nin the jaws. In the tree-sloths and many †ground-sloths the foremost\r\ntooth in each jaw is a more or less enlarged, canine-like tusk. The\r\nteeth are always rootless, growing from permanent pulps, and are without\r\nenamel, made up of dentine, which is sometimes homogeneous and sometimes\r\nin layers of different hardness, and with a covering of cement, usually\r\nthin and film-like. The number of teeth varies from 4/4 to 10/10 or more,\r\nand their form usually approximates a simple cylinder, worn off flat at\r\nthe end, though the ends may be bevelled or grooved, differences which\r\nare in no way due to pattern but simply to the mode of wear. In the\r\n†glyptodonts the teeth were divided by deep vertical grooves into two\r\nor three pillars, connected by narrow necks. In most of the edentates\r\nthere is no change of teeth, the milk-dentition having been completely\r\nsuppressed, but in the 9-Banded Armadillo (_Tatu_) each of the permanent\r\nteeth is preceded by a two-rooted milk-tooth, and some other armadillos\r\nhave milk-teeth.\r\n\r\nThe skull varies much in form and proportions, according to the character\r\nof the food and method of feeding. The tree-sloths and †ground-sloths\r\nhave short, rounded heads; in the †glyptodonts, the skull was short and\r\nremarkably deep vertically; while the armadillos have long, shallow\r\nheads, with tapering muzzle, the length and slenderness of which differ\r\nin the various genera. In the anteaters the skull is extraordinarily\r\nelongate and slender. The sagittal crest is seldom present at all and\r\nnever prominent. The zygomatic arch may be complete or interrupted;\r\nin the tree-sloths, †ground-sloths, †glyptodonts and some extinct\r\narmadillos, there is a descending, plate-like process given off beneath\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\nThe backbone displays some of the most remarkable peculiarities of\r\nthe order. The neck in the tree-sloths has eight or nine vertebræ,\r\nthe only instances known among mammals in which the normal number of\r\nseven is departed from. In the armadillos and †glyptodonts several of\r\nthe neck-vertebræ are coössified into a single piece, but the atlas is\r\nalways free, so as to permit the movements of the head. In the posterior\r\npart of the dorsal and in the lumbar region the articulations between\r\nthe successive vertebræ are by far the most complex and intricate\r\nknown among mammals; in the tree-sloths these have degenerated, though\r\nstill plainly indicated. In the †glyptodonts, which were covered with\r\na huge, tortoise-like carapace, mobility of the backbone was needless,\r\nand so all of the dorsal vertebræ were united into one long piece and\r\nthe lumbars were coössified with one another and with the sacrum.\r\nThe sacrum consists, throughout the order, of a very large number of\r\nvertebræ and is attached to the hip-bones at two different points,\r\ninstead of only one, as in other mammals. The tail varies much in\r\nlength and thickness; in the tree-sloths it is extremely short and in\r\nthe anteaters very long and bushy, prehensile in the arboreal members\r\nof the group; in the †ground-sloths, especially the gigantic forms, it\r\nwas of immense thickness; while in most of the †glyptodonts a varying\r\nnumber of the terminal vertebræ were fused together. The sternal ribs\r\nare better developed than in any other mammals, and in the anteaters and\r\n†ground-sloths they articulate with the breast-bone by regular synovial\r\njoints, and each rib has head and tubercle like a vertebral rib.\r\n\r\nIn the limbs and feet there is great variety, according to the manner\r\nof their employment. The shoulder-blade has a very long acromion and\r\nvery large coracoid, which long remains separate from the scapula;\r\ncollar-bones are very generally present, though often in much reduced\r\ncondition. The hip-bones have in the tree-sloths, †ground-sloths and\r\n†glyptodonts a much expanded anterior element, which in the other groups\r\nis narrow. The humerus usually has very prominent deltoid and supinator\r\nridges and epicondylar foramen; the fore-arm bones are always separate,\r\nand there is generally much freedom of rotation of the manus. In the\r\nwrist there is no distinct central and usually there are the ordinary\r\neight separate bones. The tibia and fibula are frequently coössified.\r\nThe tree-sloths, which lead most strictly arboreal lives and are almost\r\nhelpless on the ground, are unique among mammals in that the body is\r\nhabitually _suspended_ from the limbs, not carried upon them; the feet\r\nare curved hooks, which fit over the tree-branches and support the weight\r\nwithout muscular exertion. The limb-bones are very long and slender,\r\nthe claws long, curved and sharp, and the metapodials of each foot, two\r\nor three in number, are fused into a single mass. In the †ground-sloths\r\nthere was much change in foot-structure during the course of their\r\nrecorded development; they were usually five-toed and the feet were armed\r\nwith one or more great claws; the later and larger representatives of the\r\nsuborder walked upon the outer edge of the feet.\r\n\r\nThe armadillos, which are largely burrowers, have five-toed feet and\r\nlong, heavy, pointed claws, but in some of them the pes has a varying\r\nnumber of flat, hoof-like nails. The immense †glyptodonts had very short,\r\nbroad feet, shod with hoofs, which, in some of the genera, were longer\r\nand more claw-like in the manus.\r\n\r\nThe recorded history of the edentates was developed almost entirely\r\nin South America. In the Casa Mayor formation there were numerous\r\narmadillos, but as only scutes of the carapace have been found, little is\r\nknown of them. The †ground-sloths (_†Protobradys_) have been reported,\r\nbut from such imperfect material that the reference is uncertain. The\r\nfirst assuredly determinable members of this suborder were in the\r\nAstraponotus beds and, associated with them, the most ancient known\r\n†glyptodonts. In the Deseado stage were many armadillos, some of them\r\nextremely peculiar, several †glyptodonts and †ground-sloths, some species\r\nof the latter very large. Edentates were far more numerous and varied\r\nin the Santa Cruz than in any of the preceding stages. Tree-sloths and\r\nanteaters have both been reported, but the evidence is insufficient,\r\nthough there can be little doubt that these suborders had begun their\r\nseparate existence in some part of South America other than Patagonia.\r\nThe three families of †ground-sloths were already distinguishable,\r\nthough much less clearly separated than they afterwards became; none\r\nof them were large animals, smaller even than some of the Deseado\r\nspecies and veritable pygmies in comparison with the giants of the\r\nPliocene and Pleistocene. The †glyptodonts were likewise far smaller\r\nthan their Pliocene and Pleistocene successors and in several respects\r\nmore primitive, approximating the armadillos more closely; nor was\r\nthere any such variety of forms as in the later stages. The armadillos\r\nwere extremely numerous and varied; they all belonged to extinct genera\r\nand most of them apparently have no descendants at the present day.\r\nThe tropical forests of Brazil and the Guianas must then, as now, have\r\nswarmed with mammals which did not extend their range to Patagonia and\r\nof which we consequently have no record. No doubt, it was in these\r\nforests that the ancestors of most modern armadillos, as well as of the\r\ntree-sloths and anteaters, lived in Miocene times.\r\n\r\nPliocene edentates were of the same suborders as those of the Santa\r\nCruz, but far larger in size. Most of them are known only from very\r\nincomplete specimens, but the Pleistocene has yielded an enormous mass\r\nof beautifully preserved material. Of the tree-sloths and anteaters,\r\nonly questionable remains have been found. That these tropical and\r\nforest-loving animals should not have occurred in the open Pampas of\r\nArgentina is not surprising, but it is difficult to account for their\r\nabsence from the extremely rich cave-faunas of Brazil. Nearly all the\r\nexisting genera of armadillos have been obtained, and with these were\r\nassociated several extinct genera, some of them (_†Chlamydotherium_,\r\n_†Eutatus_) relatively huge, as large as tapirs. There was a wonderful\r\nvariety of †glyptodonts, most of them enormous creatures, of which no\r\nless than five genera have been collected in Argentina and Brazil, and\r\nthe †ground-sloths were even more numerous and varied. Nine genera,\r\nwith many species, of these great beasts, which ranged in size from an\r\nelephant to a tapir, are already known and no doubt the list is still\r\nincomplete. These †glyptodonts and †ground-sloths must have been among\r\nthe most conspicuous elements of the Pleistocene fauna.\r\n\r\nAside from certain problematical Eocene forms, the first North American\r\nedentates, which were immigrants from the southern continent, appeared\r\nprobably in the middle Miocene of Oregon in the form of †ground-sloths,\r\nbut the specimen, as well as a similar one from the lower Pliocene of\r\nNebraska, is not sufficiently complete for positive reference. In the\r\nmiddle Pliocene the †ground-sloths and †glyptodonts were unquestionably\r\npresent, and in the Pleistocene these two suborders were numerously and\r\nconspicuously represented. Three or four genera of the huge, elephantine\r\n†ground-sloths coexisted in Pleistocene North America. _†Megalonyx_\r\nwas abundant in the forested regions east of the Mississippi, from\r\nPennsylvania southward, and on the Pacific coast; _†Mylodon_ was\r\ntranscontinental in distribution; while _†Megatherium_ was apparently\r\nconfined to the southern states. While all three genera undoubtedly\r\noriginated in South America, _†Megalonyx_ has not yet been found in that\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThis genus was originally named by President Jefferson in 1805 from an\r\nungual phalanx found in a cave in Virginia, and he imagined that it\r\nbelonged to a colossal lion which must still be living in the mountains\r\nof western Virginia. This was deduced from the assumption that no species\r\ncould become extinct, and the passage is of interest as showing the\r\nprevalent belief of the time, although Cuvier had already demonstrated\r\nthat many species had actually been extinguished. The passage is as\r\nfollows: “The movements of nature are in a never ending circle. The\r\nanimal species which has once been put into a train of motion is still\r\nprobably moving in that train. For, if one link in nature’s chain might\r\nbe lost, another and another might be lost, till this whole system of\r\nthings should evanish by piecemeal.”\r\n\r\nThe †glyptodonts were also southern in distribution, and only very\r\nimperfect remains of them have yet been recovered from the North American\r\nPleistocene, quite sufficient, however, to make the identification\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nThere were several genera of rather small †ground-sloths in the\r\nPleistocene of Cuba. The best known of these, _†Megalocnus_, had\r\nseveral peculiarities of structure, but was plainly a member of the\r\n†Megalonychidæ. The ancestors of this genus probably invaded Cuba in the\r\nPliocene, when the island was joined to Central America.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER †GRAVIGRADA. †GROUND-SLOTHS\r\n\r\nAs the †ground-sloths would appear to have had a more central position\r\nwithin the order than any of the other groups, our study of development\r\nmay well begin with them. In the Pleistocene there were three families\r\nof these gigantic brutes, which ranged through the western hemisphere\r\nfrom Pennsylvania and California to Patagonia. Unfortunately our\r\nknowledge of the developmental stages within the different families is\r\nvery unequal, and it is therefore impracticable to do more than sketch\r\nthe changes of the suborder as a whole and in a general way. In the\r\nsuccessive geological stages the proportionate representation of the\r\ndifferent phyla varied greatly; in the South American Pliocene and\r\nPleistocene the †Mylodontidæ and †Megatheriidæ were the abundant forms,\r\nwhile the †Megalonychidæ were but scantily represented. In the Santa\r\nCruz Miocene, on the other hand, the overwhelming preponderance was with\r\nthe †Megalonychidæ, the other two families being comparatively rare and\r\nincompletely known. From the still more ancient formations, the material\r\nso far collected is so fragmentary that family distinctions have little\r\nmeaning. After all, there was no very wide range of variation among the\r\ncontemporary members of the three families, and the differences were\r\nprincipally in size, in the form and number of the teeth, the shape of\r\nthe skull and the number of digits; in essentials they were all much\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nThe genus _†Megatherium_ (Fig. 122, p. 220) included the largest and\r\nmost massive members of the suborder, _†M. americanum_ being as large as\r\nan elephant, but very differently proportioned, as it was much longer\r\nand lower in stature, owing to the shortness of the extraordinarily\r\nheavy limbs; some of the skeletons measure 20 feet or more in length.\r\nThe teeth, which were 5/4 in number, formed an uninterrupted series on\r\neach side; all had the same quadrate form and by abrasion were worn into\r\ntwo transverse ridges, formed by the meeting of the harder dentine with\r\nthe thick coating of cement. The result was a form of tooth which much\r\nresembled the lower molars of a tapir, but it was not a tooth-pattern in\r\nany proper sense of the word, being due entirely to the mode of wear.\r\n\r\nThe skull was very small in proportion to the huge body and was low\r\nand narrow in shape; the cranium had a broad, flat roof, without\r\nsagittal crest; the orbit was completely encircled in bone, and the\r\ndescending process of the zygomatic arch beneath the eye was very long\r\nand conspicuous. The nasals were short, and the slender, toothless\r\npremaxillaries projected far in front of them, which makes the presence\r\nof some sort of a proboscis likely. The lower jaw had a long, narrow,\r\nspout-like symphysis, which was abruptly rounded at the free end,\r\nnot pointed; below the teeth, the lower margin of the jaw was very\r\nstrongly convex, descending in a great flange. The neck was short, the\r\nbody very long and enormously heavy, as was also the tail. The immense\r\nshoulder-blade had a very long acromion, which curved forward and inward,\r\nfusing with the coracoid and forming a bony loop or bridge. The hip-bones\r\nhad the anterior element (ilium) enormously expanded transversely, so as\r\nto support the huge mass of viscera in the semi-erect position which the\r\nanimal, it is believed, frequently assumed in feeding. Collar-bones were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe fore limb was very much more slender than the hind, but of nearly the\r\nsame length. The humerus had a comparatively slender upper portion and\r\nextremely broad lower end, due to the great development of the internal\r\nepicondyle and supinator ridge; there was no epicondylar foramen. The\r\nradius evidently had the power of very free rotation upon the humerus.\r\nThe femur was short, flattened antero-posteriorly, but excessively\r\nbroad and heavy, and had no third trochanter. The tibia and fibula\r\nwere likewise short and very massive and were extensively coössified\r\nat each end, leaving but a short interspace open between the bones.\r\nThe very peculiar feet were so connected with the limb-bones, that the\r\nanimal must have walked upon the outer edge of the foot, somewhat as the\r\nexisting Ant-Bear (_Myrmecophaga jubata_) uses the fore foot. The manus\r\nhad four functional digits, the first being a mere vestige; the fifth,\r\nupon which the weight rested in walking, had two very small phalanges\r\nand no claw, while the second, third and fourth had long, sharp claws.\r\nThe pes had but three functional digits, for the first and second were\r\nreduced to rudiments; digit III had an enormous claw and of this digit\r\nthe metatarsal was short and very heavy and the first two phalanges were\r\nfused together; the two external digits, Nos. IV and V, had no claws. The\r\nastragalus had a very peculiar shape, made necessary by the application\r\nof the external border of the foot to the ground and thus in both fore\r\nand hind feet the great claws were turned inward and, in the case of the\r\npes, it must have been impossible to rest the sole upon the ground. The\r\nheel-bone was enormous and club-shaped and formed the hinder portion of\r\nthe weight-carrying outer edge of the foot.\r\n\r\nAlmost all who have studied the structure of this extraordinary beast are\r\nagreed as to its habits. That it fed principally, if not exclusively,\r\nupon leaves, is indicated by the teeth. The general opinion as to its\r\nmanner of life is well summed up by von Zittel: “The hip-bones, hind legs\r\nand tail are characterized by enormous strength. The entire structure\r\nof the extremities proves that the gigantic sloth could move over the\r\nground but slowly and clumsily; on the other hand, the fore limbs\r\nserved as grasping organs and were presumably employed to bend down and\r\nbreak off twigs and branches and even to uproot whole trees, while the\r\nweight of the body was supported upon the hind legs and tail.”[19] It\r\nwould be quite absurd to suppose that such ponderous animals could have\r\nbeen climbers or burrowers, hence the function of the enormous claws,\r\nespecially the single one of the pes, is not obvious, though they may\r\nhave been merely the weapons of the otherwise defenceless monsters. The\r\ngreat claw in the fore foot of the Ant-Bear is a terrible weapon, with\r\nwhich the creature vigorously and successfully defends itself against\r\ndogs, and it may even be dangerous to men, if incautiously molested.\r\n\r\n_†Megatherium_ had no bony scutes, or other ossifications in the skin, so\r\nfar as is known, and was probably covered with long and coarse hair, as\r\nis known to have been the case in another †ground-sloth.\r\n\r\nLess specialized in many respects than the †megatheres was _†Mylodon_,\r\ntype of a family which was numerously and variously represented in the\r\nPleistocene of South America, much less so in that of North America.\r\n_†Mylodon_ was smaller and lighter, being from ⅓ to ¼ smaller in linear\r\ndimensions than _†Megatherium_, and the contemporary _†Scelidotherium_\r\nwas no bigger than a tapir. The teeth numbered 5/4 and the anterior one\r\nabove and below had a somewhat tusk-like form; the others were worn off\r\nevenly, with nearly horizontal grinding surface, but a vertical groove\r\non the inner side gave them a subtriangular, lobate form. The skull\r\nwas short and broad, with flat top, and orbit only partially enclosed\r\nbehind; the premaxillaries were very short and the muzzle very broad and\r\nabruptly truncated, the nasal opening very large. The lower jaw had a\r\nstraight inferior border, a short, very wide and shovel-shaped symphysis\r\nand square chin. Nothing indicates a proboscis, and the head must have\r\nbeen very different from that of _†Megatherium_.\r\n\r\nWithin the family of the †mylodonts there was some variety in the\r\ndentition and more in the shape of the skull. In _†Lestodon_, for\r\nexample, the first tooth in each jaw was a large, sharp-pointed tusk,\r\nthe muzzle was greatly broadened, and the whole animal was larger.\r\n_†Scelidotherium_, the smallest Pleistocene member of the family,\r\nhad a much narrower and more elongate skull than the others. In\r\n_†Glossotherium_, which also had an elongate skull, there was an arched\r\nbony bridge connecting the anterior end of the nasal bones with the\r\npremaxillaries and dividing the nasal opening into two parts.\r\n\r\nThe neck, body and tail of _†Mylodon_ did not differ materially from\r\nthose of _†Megatherium_, except in being smaller and less massive. The\r\nfore limb was relatively somewhat shorter and much stouter, but otherwise\r\nsimilar; the humerus had no epicondylar foramen and the femur no third\r\ntrochanter; the tibia and fibula were separate. The manus had five\r\ndigits, Nos. I, II and III carrying claws, that of III being especially\r\nlarge; IV and V had no claws and the outer edge of the manus rested on\r\nthe ground in walking, the sole turned inward. The pes had lost the first\r\ndigit, the second and third had claws, but not the fourth and fifth; the\r\nweight rested on the outer edge.\r\n\r\nThe skin is definitely known from large pieces belonging to the allied\r\ngenus _†Grypotherium_, found in a cavern near Last Hope Inlet, Patagonia,\r\nwhere it had been preserved by burial in dry dust. Externally, the skin\r\nwas thickly covered with coarse hair and in the deeper layers was a\r\ncontinuous armour of small ossicles, which were close set and in the\r\nLast Hope specimens show like a cobble-stone pavement on the inner side\r\nof the skin, the innermost layers of which have been destroyed; in life,\r\nthese small bones were not visible. Similar ossicles have been found\r\nin association with several skeletons of _†Mylodon_. The habits, diet\r\nand mode of feeding of the latter were no doubt essentially similar to\r\nthose of _†Megatherium_, but _†Scelidotherium_, which had a much shorter\r\nand lighter tail, was probably more quadrupedal and browsed upon low\r\nshrubbery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 288.—Gigantic †ground-sloth (_†Mylodon robustus_),\r\nPampean. Restored from Owen’s figure of the skeleton.]\r\n\r\nThe third family, the †Megalonychidæ, was scantily represented in the\r\nPleistocene of South America, but relatively common in North America.\r\n_†Megalonyx_ was, on the whole, less specialized than _†Mylodon_ or\r\n_†Megatherium_, but had a strong resemblance to both of them. The\r\nteeth, 5/4 in number, had the foremost one in each jaw separated by a\r\nconsiderable space from the others and more or less tusk-like in form;\r\nthe grinding teeth were worn smooth, without ridges, and of somewhat\r\ntrihedral shape. The skull was short, broad and deep, resembling in shape\r\nthat of the tree-sloths; there was a long, but feebly developed sagittal\r\ncrest, and the orbits were widely open behind, with hardly a trace of\r\nany posterior boundary. The muzzle was very short and broad and abruptly\r\ntruncated and the premaxillary bones were extremely small. The lower\r\njaw was short, thick and massive, with very broad symphysis and almost\r\nvertical chin. Neck, body, tail, shoulder and hip-bones did not differ\r\nsufficiently from those of _†Megatherium_ to require particular notice.\r\n\r\nThe fore limb was shorter and more slender than the hind; the humerus had\r\nthe epicondylar foramen and the very massive femur retained the third\r\ntrochanter; the tibia and fibula were separate. The feet had five digits,\r\nthree of which carried claws; the calcaneum was very peculiar, not at\r\nall like the massive, club-shaped bone of _†Megatherium_ and _†Mylodon_,\r\nbut long, comparatively thin and sickle-shaped. Nothing in the skeleton\r\nsuggests that the creature’s habits differed in any important way from\r\nthose of the genera last named.\r\n\r\n_†Megalocnus_, of the Cuban Pleistocene, a member of this family,\r\nwas apparently peculiar to the island and was probably derived from\r\nancestors which in the Pliocene migrated from Central America. Aside\r\nfrom certain remarkable peculiarities of the teeth, this animal was more\r\nprimitive, as well as smaller, than any other of the Pleistocene genera.\r\n\r\nAlthough remains of †Gravigrada are comparatively common in all of the\r\nfossiliferous formations between the Pampean and the Santa Cruz, the\r\nmaterial is too imperfect to throw any useful light upon the development\r\nof the various families. From the Santa Cruz beds, on the other hand, a\r\ngreat wealth of specimens has been obtained, and it is possible to give\r\nsome fairly adequate account of the †ground-sloths of that time. These\r\nanimals were then extremely abundant individually and of extraordinary\r\nvariety; evidently, they were in a state of rapid expansion and divergent\r\nevolution along many lines, for hardly any two specimens are alike\r\nand therefore the satisfactory discrimination of species is well-nigh\r\nimpossible. Yet, with all this remarkable variability, the range of\r\nstructural differences was not great; the group was a very homogeneous\r\nand natural one, and separation into families was not obvious. Two of the\r\nthree families were, however, unequivocally present in this fauna and\r\nthe third somewhat doubtfully so. The †Megalonychidæ, which in the South\r\nAmerican Pleistocene had dwindled to such insignificant proportions,\r\nformed the overwhelming majority of the Santa Cruz †Gravigrada;\r\nthe †Mylodontidæ were quite rare in comparison and are still very\r\nincompletely known; while the †Megatheriidæ, though probably present,\r\nhave not been identified beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\nAll of the Santa Cruz †ground-sloths were small animals, the largest not\r\napproximating the smallest Pleistocene species, those of Cuba excepted,\r\nand many of them were no larger than the modern tree-sloths. This was\r\na wonderful difference between the Santa Cruz and the Pampean, but a\r\ndifference which involved nearly all other groups of mammals. So far\r\nas the skeleton is concerned, this is known with completeness only for\r\nthe †Megalonychidæ, especially the genus _†Hapalops_; but enough has\r\nbeen learned of the others to show that there was far less difference\r\nbetween the families than had arisen in the later epochs. This backward\r\nconvergence of the three groups towards a common term plainly indicates\r\ntheir common origin, being exactly what might have been predicted in\r\nadvance of experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 289.—Santa Cruz †ground-sloth (_†Hapalops\r\nlongiceps_) and †glyptodont (_†Propalæohoplophorus australis_). Restored\r\nby Knight from skeletons in Princeton University and the museum of La\r\nPlata.]\r\n\r\nIn all the genera the teeth number 5/4; the teeth on each side were\r\nsometimes in continuous series, sometimes the first one was isolated\r\nand almost always more or less tusk-like, most so in _†Eucholœops_. The\r\nother teeth were usually of transversely elliptical shape and worn into\r\ntwo ridges, with a hollow between; the †mylodonts (_†Nematherium_, etc.)\r\nalready had the triangular, or lozenge-shaped, lobate form of teeth,\r\ncharacteristic of the family.\r\n\r\nThe skull varied considerably in its proportions; generally, it was long\r\nand narrow, with shortened face and elongate cranium; the sagittal crest\r\nwas seldom present, never prominent, and the orbit was always widely open\r\nbehind, without postorbital processes. The premaxillaries were always\r\nshort and toothless and in most of the genera they were slender rods, in\r\nothers (_e.g._ _†Hyperleptus_) broad and plate-like. The lower jaw had an\r\nelongate spout-like symphysis, in which the two halves were coössified,\r\ntapering forward to a blunt point and, though the length of this spout\r\ndiffered greatly in the various genera, in none was there a broad, abrupt\r\nchin such as _†Mylodon_ and _†Megalonyx_ had. In _†Prepotherium_, which\r\nis believed to be referable to the †Megatheriidæ, the lower jaw had the\r\nextremely convex inferior border, in less exaggerated degree, of its huge\r\nPampean successor; it would be premature to say descendant.\r\n\r\nWhile the long, slender skull was the prevailing type among the Santa\r\nCruz †Gravigrada, there was a group of small animals in which the skull\r\nwas shorter and more rounded and had a very suggestive likeness to that\r\nof the modern tree-sloths, as was likewise true of the teeth.\r\n\r\nDespite innumerable variations of detail, the skeleton of the Santa Cruz\r\n†ground-sloths may be described without distinction of genera, though\r\nit should be added that the skeleton is but partially known in many of\r\nthe genera, and fuller knowledge might require modification of some of\r\nthe statements. The neck was of moderate length, the body long, the\r\ntail long and heavy and, in some instances, very massive. The sternal\r\nribs were completely ossified and already had the same elaborate mode\r\nof articulation with the breast-bone as in the great Pampean forms, and\r\nthe vertebræ the same intricate connections. The shoulder-blade also had\r\nthe same characteristics as in the latter, but the hip-bones had but a\r\nmoderate transverse expansion, having no huge mass of viscera to support.\r\n\r\nThe limbs were stout and short, fore and hind legs of nearly equal\r\nlength; the humerus had the epicondylar foramen and the broad, flattened\r\nfemur retained the third trochanter. The radius had a discoidal upper\r\nend, which rotated freely upon the humerus; the tibia and fibula were\r\nalways separate. The feet were five-toed, all the digits complete and\r\nfunctional and all provided with claws; there was no coössification\r\nbetween the phalanges. The astragalus was little different from\r\nthe normal form, but in some genera (_e.g._ _†Prepotherium_) the\r\nhighly peculiar form of this bone characteristic of _†Mylodon_ and\r\n_†Megatherium_ was distantly foreshadowed. The gait must have been simply\r\nplantigrade, though some of the forms had probably begun to throw the\r\nweight upon the outer edge of the foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 290.—Left pes of _†Mylodon_, Pampean (after Owen).\r\n_Cal._, calcaneum. _As._, astragalus. _N._, navicular. _Cn. 2_, _Cn. 3_,\r\nmiddle and external cuneiforms. _Cb._, cuboid.]\r\n\r\nNo dermal armour has yet been found in association with any of the\r\ngenera, and, so far as the predominant †Megalonychidæ are concerned, of\r\nwhich so many skeletons have been collected, this negative evidence must\r\nbe allowed great weight. But the material of the other two families is\r\nso rare and incomplete, that the failure to find dermal ossicles is of\r\nno value in determining the question; probably, the †mylodonts possessed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThese small Santa Cruz †ground-sloths were not so clumsy and slow-moving\r\nas their gigantic successors of the Pampean, and must have been\r\ninoffensive plant-eaters, some of them perhaps more or less arboreal in\r\nhabits, but they could defend themselves with their long, sharp claws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 291.—Left pes of _†Hapalops_, Santa Cruz. Princeton\r\nUniversity Museum. Letters as in Fig. 290 and scale of reduction the\r\nsame.]\r\n\r\nIt would require far too much space and lead us into a labyrinth of\r\nanatomical technicalities to point out all the many resemblances to\r\nother edentate suborders which are to be noted in the skeleton of the\r\nSanta Cruz †Gravigrada, which thus justified their position as the most\r\nnearly central group of the entire order. Not only was the skeleton of\r\nthese Miocene †ground-sloths very much less specialized than in their\r\nPleistocene successors, but they were much closer to the anteaters\r\nthan were the latter. Aside from the skull, all parts of the skeleton\r\ndisplayed this resemblance in so marked a manner that the common\r\nderivation of the two suborders seems hardly open to question. Different\r\nas was the skull in the two groups, the differences were not such as\r\nto preclude the origin of both from the same type. Even more closely\r\nconnected were the †ground-sloths and the tree-sloths; the resemblance\r\nwas most clear in the teeth and skull, but there were also many points\r\nof likeness throughout the skeleton. In the tree-sloths the entire\r\nbony structure has been profoundly modified in adaptation to their\r\naltogether exceptional mode of life, in hanging _suspended_ from the\r\nbranches of trees; but, despite this modification, there are so many\r\nnotable resemblances between the Santa Cruz †Gravigrada and the existing\r\nTardigrada as irresistibly to suggest their community of origin, and thus\r\nthe former served to connect the anteaters, on the one hand, with the\r\ntree-sloths, on the other. This must not be construed as meaning that\r\nthe Miocene †ground-sloths were the ancestors of the other suborders,\r\nwhich were probably already in existence as distinct groups, but merely\r\nthat all three suborders had a common origin, from which the Santa Cruz\r\n†Gravigrada had departed less than have the sloths and anteaters.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that at least two of the †ground-sloth families, the\r\n†Megalonychidæ and the †Mylodontidæ, were distinguishable in the Deseado\r\nstage, but materials are still lacking to give us any real knowledge of\r\nthe suborder in that or the more ancient stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LORICATA. ARMOURED EDENTATES\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER DASYPODA. ARMADILLOS\r\n\r\nArmadillos are still an important and characteristic element of the\r\nNeotropical fauna, ranging from Texas to Patagonia and showing a\r\nconsiderable variety of structure and appearance. Existing species are\r\nall of small or moderate size, and the one which is by far the largest\r\n(_Priodontes gigas_) may somewhat exceed three feet in length, exclusive\r\nof the tail, and the smallest (_Chlamydophorus truncatus_) is hardly more\r\nthan five inches long. In most armadillos the hair is greatly diminished\r\nin quantity and the animal is sheathed in a conspicuous armour of bony\r\nscutes, covered with horny plates. There is a head-shield which covers\r\nthe top of the skull, and the tail is enclosed in a sheath; the back and\r\nsides are protected by the great carapace and the limbs by irregular\r\nscutes and scales, leaving only the under side of the body and the inside\r\nof the legs uncovered. In most existing genera, the carapace is in\r\nthree parts, an anterior and posterior buckler, in which the plates are\r\nimmovably fixed together by their edges, and between a varying number\r\nof transverse, overlapping bands, from 3 to 13, which permit sufficient\r\nflexibility of the body. The tail-sheath is made up of a series of rings.\r\nOne genus (_Tolypeutes_) has the power of rolling itself into a ball, the\r\nhead-shield exactly closing the anterior notch of the carapace and the\r\ntail-sheath filling the posterior notch. The animal is thus perfectly\r\nprotected against attack and does not seek refuge by digging, as other\r\narmadillos do and with astonishing rapidity. In the little Pichiciago\r\n(_Chlamydophorus_) the dermal ossifications are very thin and the\r\ncarapace is composed of twenty transverse bands of horny plates, without\r\nbucklers; the rump is covered with a broad and heavy shield of bone,\r\noverlaid with thin plates of horn, which is attached to the hip-bones\r\nand notched below for the short tail. In certain rare and little known\r\ngenera there is a greater development of hair; in one (_Praopus_) the\r\nwhole carapace is covered with a dense coat of hair, and in another\r\n(_Scleropleura_) the middle of the back has only a hairy skin and the\r\ncarapace is restricted to the sides.\r\n\r\nThe teeth vary in number and size in the different genera; in some (_e.g.\r\nDasypus_) there is one upper incisor on each side; the teeth are all\r\nsimple and of nearly cylindrical form. The skull is low and flattened,\r\nwith long tapering snout and orbits widely open behind; the zygomatic\r\narches are uninterrupted. Most of the vertebræ of the neck are fused into\r\na single piece; in the lumbar and posterior dorsal regions there are not\r\nonly the usual highly intricate articulations between the vertebræ, but\r\nalso high processes on each side for the support of the carapace. The\r\nfully ossified sternal ribs have movable joints with the breast-bone, but\r\nnot the double articulations found in the anteaters and †ground-sloths.\r\nThe shoulder-blade has a very long acromion, which does not form a bony\r\nloop with the coracoid, and the clavicles are complete. The anterior\r\nelement (ilium) of the hip-bone is narrow, very different from the\r\nbroad plate of the †Gravigrada. The humerus has prominent deltoid and\r\nsupinator ridges and an epicondylar foramen, and the femur has the third\r\ntrochanter. Though the fore-arm bones are separate, the radius has no\r\nfreedom of rotation; tibia and fibula are coössified at both ends.\r\n\r\nIn the hind foot there is no great variety of character; it is\r\nfive-toed and usually has claws, but may have broad, flat nails (_e.g.\r\nPriodontes_), but the manus, which is a burrowing organ, displays\r\ndifferent degrees of specialization, which is carried farthest in the\r\nGiant Armadillo (_Priodontes_). _Tatu_ has the fore foot of quite\r\ndifferent type. The armadillos feed chiefly upon insects and worms, but\r\nthey are omnivorous and eat roots and carrion and sometimes even capture\r\nand devour small rodents and lizards.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the †ground-sloths, the fossil armadillos so far\r\navailable are insufficient for tracing the history of the various phyla,\r\nor for doing more than making a very brief sketch of the development\r\nof the suborder as a whole. Nearly all of the modern genera have been\r\nfound in the Pleistocene together with several that are extinct, some of\r\nthe latter of very large size. One of these, _†Eutatus_, had a carapace\r\nwithout bucklers and made up of 33 movable, transverse bands. Another,\r\n_†Chlamydotherium_, as large as a rhinoceros and the largest known\r\narmadillo, had anterior and posterior bucklers, with several movable\r\nbands between; it was especially characterized by the teeth, which were\r\ndivided by a vertical groove into pillars or lobes, thus approximating\r\nthe teeth of the †glyptodonts. The genus went far back into the Pliocene,\r\nand the more ancient species were successively smaller.\r\n\r\nThough remains of armadillos abound in the formations between the\r\nPampean and the Santa Cruz, they are for the most part so fragmentary\r\nas to be of no service in deciphering the history of the group. In the\r\nSanta Cruz beds also they are very abundant and varied, and several of\r\nthe genera are very completely known. As a whole, this assemblage of\r\narmadillos was very different from that of the Pleistocene, and only a\r\nfew direct ancestors of the latter have been found in the Miocene of\r\nPatagonia; no doubt, like the ancestral tree-sloths and anteaters, they\r\nwere then living in the warmer regions of the north. Most of the Santa\r\nCruz armadillos belonged to aberrant types, of which no descendants\r\nhave survived; but, nevertheless, they throw welcome light upon the\r\ndevelopmental stages of the suborder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 292.—Skull of _†Peltephilus_, Santa Cruz. Ameghino\r\ncollection.]\r\n\r\nThese armadillos had the complete armour of head-shield, carapace and\r\ntail-sheath, but the carapace had no anterior buckler in any of the Santa\r\nCruz genera, and in some there was no posterior buckler, the carapace\r\nconsisting entirely of transverse, movable bands, as in the Pleistocene\r\n_†Eutatus_. In one especially peculiar genus, _†Peltephilus_, the\r\nhead-shield was remarkable; it was made up of large, polygonal plates,\r\nthe two anterior pairs of which were elevated into high, sharp points,\r\nwhich must have supported horns, that were quite large in proportion to\r\nthe size of the animal. A 4-horned armadillo, like a tiny rhinoceros in\r\narmour, must have been a sufficiently bizarre object.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the teeth of the Santa Cruz armadillos were of the same\r\nsimple, cylindrical form as in the modern genera and arranged in the same\r\nway, but there were some exceptions. In the horned _†Peltephilus_, the\r\nteeth of each jaw were so inserted as to form a continuous series around\r\nthe sides and front of the mouth; and, at first sight, it would seem that\r\nthis genus differed from all other known edentates in having a full set\r\nof incisors, but actually it had but one on each side above and below, as\r\nhas the modern _Dasypus_, with the difference that, in the latter, the\r\nincisors of the opposite sides are widely separated and in _†Peltephilus_\r\nwere brought close together. The anterior upper teeth were long and sharp\r\nand passed outside of the lower ones, when the jaws were closed, and\r\nall the teeth had an external layer of hard and shining dentine, which\r\nhad almost the appearance of enamel. Another variant in dentition was\r\n_†Proeutatus_, which was the largest of Santa Cruz armadillos and larger\r\nthan any existing forms except _Priodontes_ and _Cabassous_. It had teeth\r\nlike those of the huge Pliocene and Pleistocene _†Chlamydotherium_, of\r\nwhich it was a probable ancestor; the five posterior ones in each jaw\r\nwere of trihedral shape, and the two kinds of dentine, of which they were\r\ncomposed, were so arranged as to form a rough grinding surface. Probably\r\nthis animal subsisted largely upon vegetable food; at all events, the\r\nfood was of such a nature as to keep the teeth worn down more than in\r\nany of the associated genera. A fourth type of dentition was displayed\r\nby _†Stegotherium_ (Fig. 243, p. 480); the teeth were so few and small\r\nthat they can have had no functional value and were merely minute points\r\nalmost level with the gums. In all probability, _†Stegotherium_ was more\r\nexclusively insectivorous than the other genera.\r\n\r\nAmong the Santa Cruz armadillos may be distinguished four well-marked\r\ntypes of skull. (1) That which agrees closely with the modern form,\r\nespecially as exemplified by the genus _Dasypus_. (2) _†Proeutatus_ had\r\na higher and less flattened cranium and a very long, cylindrical muzzle.\r\n(3) In the horned _†Peltephilus_ the face was very short and broad,\r\nand the lower jaw was horseshoe-shaped, the two halves coössified at\r\nthe symphysis, which is not true of any other armadillo. (4) Quite the\r\nopposite extreme was displayed by _†Stegotherium_, in which the face was\r\ndrawn out into a very long, slender and tapering muzzle; the lower jaw\r\nwas extremely weak and thin, the posterior, ascending portion low and\r\nill-defined, the condyle and coronoid process much reduced. No other\r\nknown armadillo has such fragile jaws, and there was a distinct likeness\r\nin the skull to that of the Ant-Bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 293.—Skull of _†Proeutatus_, Santa Cruz. Princeton\r\nUniversity Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 294.—Skull of _†Stegotherium_, Santa Cruz. Princeton\r\nUniversity Museum.]\r\n\r\nAside from carapace and skull, the skeleton of the Santa Cruz armadillos\r\nwas surprisingly modern. The vertebræ of the neck were coössified,\r\nthose of the lumbar and posterior dorsal regions had the extremely\r\ncomplex articulations and the high processes for the support of the\r\ncarapace, just as in the Recent genera. The limb-bones did not differ\r\nin any significant way from those of the latter, and the feet closely\r\nresembled those of the modern _Dasypus_; none of the genera displayed\r\nthe specialization of the manus seen in _Cabassous_, _Priodontes_ or\r\n_Tolypeutes_. Whether these specializations have all been acquired since\r\nSanta Cruz times, or whether they had already appeared in some other\r\nregion of the continent, is a question that remains to be determined.\r\n\r\nLittle can yet be done in the way of tracing the history of the\r\narmadillos through the stages preceding the Santa Cruz times, because of\r\nthe fragmentary character of the material. The suborder was abundantly\r\nrepresented in the Deseado stage, in which some of the Santa Cruz genera\r\nexisted. Even in the most ancient of the Patagonian Tertiary formations\r\nare found scutes of the carapace essentially like those of the modern\r\narmadillos. The group is thus of very high antiquity, older than any\r\nother of the suborders is known to be.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the typical armadillos of South America, there were, in\r\nother continents, certain more or less doubtful forms, concerning which a\r\nword should be said. In the Bridger Eocene of North America was a genus\r\n(_†Metacheiromys_) of armadillo-like animals, the true relationships\r\nof which are far from clear. The teeth were mostly lost, leaving but\r\none on each side of each jaw, and this _was covered with enamel_, which\r\nis not true of any unquestioned edentate. However, this is not an\r\ninsuperable objection to the inclusion of these animals in the edentates,\r\nfor there can be no doubt that these were derived from ancestors with\r\nenamel-covered teeth. Even in modern armadillos the enamel-organ is\r\nformed in the embryo, though it does not perform its functions. The skull\r\nof _†Metacheiromys_ had something of the armadillo-shape, but was not\r\nespecially characteristic. The vertebræ of the neck were all separate,\r\nand those of the dorsal and lumbar regions did not have the complex\r\narticulations common to all known edentates, fossil and Recent; the\r\nsacrum had on each side but one point of contact with the hip-bones, and\r\nthe sternal ribs were not ossified. The shoulder-blade, hip-bones and\r\nhumerus were all armadillo-like. The plantigrade feet were five-toed\r\nand the metapodials were very edentate in form. No indication of bony\r\narmour has been found. While these curious animals may very possibly have\r\nbeen referable to the Edentata and, at all events, had several features\r\nsuggestive of relationship to that order, it can hardly be maintained\r\nthat they were unequivocal members of it. In the Oligocene of France have\r\nbeen obtained some very fragmentary fossils which were classified and\r\ndescribed as armadillos, but their character is quite problematical. It\r\nis thus possible, though far from certain, that in the early Tertiary,\r\narmadillo-like edentates were spread all over the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER †GLYPTODONTIA. †GLYPTODONTS\r\n\r\nIn the Pliocene and Pleistocene these huge armoured creatures ranged\r\nfrom the southern United States to Patagonia. That they were nearly\r\nrelated to the armadillos is clear, but they were so greatly modified and\r\nspecialized as to demand recognition as a distinct suborder.\r\n\r\nAside from their enormous size, the most striking feature of the\r\n†Glyptodontia is the extraordinary development of their defensive\r\narmour, which was far more complete and massive than in the armadillos.\r\nThe top of the head was protected by a thick head-shield, or _casque_,\r\ncomposed of several coössified plates; the body and much of the limbs\r\nwere enclosed in the immense carapace of elongate-oval, domed shape,\r\nwhich covered the neck and trunk and on the sides almost reached to\r\nthe ground. This tortoise-like carapace was composed of very thick,\r\npolygonal plates of bone (no doubt covered externally with horny plates)\r\nimmovably fixed together by their rough edges, and ornamented with an\r\nelaborate pattern of sculpture, which varied according to the genus.\r\nWith one or two exceptions, the plates of the carapace were not arranged\r\nin transverse rows, but formed a mosaic without discernible banding. In\r\nthe exceptions noted, the sides of the carapace were made up of bands,\r\nand near the margins were two or three overlapping transverse bands which\r\npermitted a minimal degree of flexibility. The tail-sheath was remarkable\r\nand differed much in appearance and make-up in the various genera. In\r\n_†Glyptodon_ the tail was comparatively short and the tail-sheath was\r\nmade up of a series of overlapping rings, each ring consisting of two\r\nrows of plates; those of the second row were ornamented, on the top and\r\nsides of the tail, with very prominent, conical projections, capped, in\r\nthe living animal, with still longer and sharper spines of horn, so that\r\nthe tail must have bristled with spikes. A more usual type of tail-sheath\r\nwas exemplified by _†Sclerocalyptus_, in which there were several\r\noverlapping rings at the root of the tail, but for much the greater part\r\nof its length the plates of the sheath were fused together into a long,\r\ntransversely oval tube, tapering very gently to the free end, where\r\nit was bluntly rounded. A modification of this type was the very long\r\ntail-sheath of _†Panochthus_, in which there were seven overlapping rings\r\nat the root, followed by a long, massive tube, the sides of which were\r\nset with three or more large and heavy, horn-like spines. In _†Dœdicurus_\r\nwas reached the maximum specialization of this type; the very long tube\r\nhad its free end greatly expanded and thickened into a huge, club-shaped\r\nmass, on the top and sides of which were fixed long and sharp horns.\r\n\r\nThe teeth, which in all the known genera numbered 8/8, were all very much\r\nalike; each was divided by two broad and deep vertical grooves on each\r\nside into three pillars, connected by narrow necks. Harder dentine in\r\nthe centre and on the periphery of the tooth, with a softer intermediate\r\nlayer, kept the grinding surface rough through differential wear. Teeth\r\nof this character are indicative of a vegetable diet and these great\r\ncreatures were, no doubt, as harmless and inoffensive as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 295.—Pampean †glyptodonts, _†Dœdicurus\r\nclavicaudatus_ and _†Glyptodon clavipes_. Restored from skeletons in the\r\nmuseums of La Plata and Buenos Aires.]\r\n\r\nThe skull was remarkably short, broad and high, the facial region being\r\nespecially abbreviated; the cranium, though forming the greater part\r\nof the skull, was yet small in comparison with the size of the animal;\r\nit had a distinct, though not prominent, sagittal crest. The occipital\r\nsurface was inclined forward and had a very elevated position, the\r\ncondyles being near the top of the head and raised very far above the\r\nlevel of the teeth. The orbits were relatively small, more or less\r\ncompletely encircled with bone and as near to the top of the head as\r\nthey could be brought; this was to make room for the extremely high\r\nteeth, which required a great depth of jaw; the elevation of the whole\r\ncranium left unlimited space for the jaws beneath it. The zygomatic\r\narches were strong and curved out widely from the sides of the skull;\r\nbeneath each eye was given off a very long descending process which\r\nprojected downward, outside of the lower jaw. In most of the species the\r\nupper profile of the skull was nearly straight, but in _†Panochthus_\r\nit descended very steeply from the forehead to the nose. The forehead\r\nwas dome-like and the nasals extremely short. Sinuses were extensively\r\ndeveloped, especially in the frontals, and in _†Sclerocalyptus_ the\r\nbones around the nostrils were grotesquely inflated. The two halves\r\nof the lower jaw were fused together, and the symphysis was prolonged\r\ninto a short, wide spout, which projected considerably in advance of\r\nthe upper jaw, showing that the soft parts of the muzzle must have had\r\na corresponding extension. The horizontal portion of the lower jaw,\r\ncarrying the teeth, was short and very deep; the posterior, ascending\r\nportion had a forward inclination and was very high.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the Pleistocene †glyptodonts was unique among mammals,\r\nthough evidently a modification of the armadillo type. The extreme\r\nmodification was conditioned by the enormous weight of the carapace,\r\nwhich the skeleton had to support. The neck was very short, made up of\r\nshort vertebræ, which were extensively coössified; the atlas was always\r\nfree, but the axis was fused with a varying number of the succeeding\r\nvertebræ; usually, the axis and the third to the sixth formed one mass,\r\nwhile the seventh was fused with the dorsals. The joint between the sixth\r\nand seventh vertebræ was such as to permit at least a partial downward\r\nbending of the head beneath the carapace, closing its anterior opening\r\nwith the head-shield. The seventh neck vertebra and all the dorsals,\r\nexcept the last one, were coössified into a heavy curved rod, the “dorsal\r\ntube”; the conjoined neural arches formed a tunnel for the spinal cord\r\nand the spines made a continuous ridge. As the hind legs were very much\r\nlonger than the fore, the back was strongly arched upward from the neck\r\nto the hips. The last dorsal, the lumbars and the sacrum were all fused\r\ntogether to form the “lumbo-sacral tube,” of which the coössified neural\r\nspines made a very prominent ridge, the principal support of the carapace\r\nin the median line; the anterior half of the trunk skeleton, comprising\r\nthe short, deep thorax, was free from the carapace, which in that region\r\nmust have rested upon the muscles of the back and shoulders. The number\r\nof neck and trunk vertebræ combined varied in the different genera from\r\n26 to 28, but fusion had reduced the number of separate parts to 4, or\r\nat most 5. Such greatly diminished flexibility of the back was rather\r\nan advantage. The tail differed much in length in the various genera,\r\nbut was always massive; the anterior vertebræ, usually 7 in number, were\r\nfree, the others were fused into a heavy, tapering rod; but for nearly\r\nits whole length the processes of the vertebræ were very prominent, each\r\nvertebra touching the tail-sheath at five points and thus giving it very\r\neffective support. In _†Glyptodon_ the tail-vertebræ were all free.\r\n\r\nIn most of the genera the scapula was very broad and had the very long\r\nacromion common to all the edentates; there were no clavicles. The\r\nhip-bones were very peculiar; the anterior element (ilium) stood almost\r\nvertically, at right angles to the backbone, and formed a broad plate,\r\nfacing forward, the top of which was roughened and thickened to support\r\nthe carapace. The posterior element (ischium) was also much expanded,\r\nbut faced outward, and its hinder end, curved upward and thickened,\r\nwas another point of strong support for the carapace. The two elements\r\ntogether formed an inverted arch, the crown of which rested on the head\r\nof the femur.\r\n\r\nThough less massive than those of the hind leg, the bones of the fore\r\nlimb were yet very heavy. The humerus was short and had reduced deltoid\r\nand supinator ridges and no epicondylar foramen; the short fore-arm bones\r\nwere separate and heavy, the ulna especially so. The femur was much the\r\nlongest of the limb-bones and was extremely strong, especially in its\r\ngreat breadth, the antero-posterior flattening, common to nearly all very\r\nheavy mammals, being well marked. A very unusual feature was the position\r\nof the third trochanter near the lower end of the shaft. The tibia and\r\nfibula were much shorter than the femur, extremely heavy and coössified\r\nat both ends. The very short and broad feet retained five digits; in the\r\nmanus the claws were sometimes comparatively long and sharp, sometimes\r\nblunt and hoof-like; those of the hind foot were always broad hoofs.\r\n\r\nAmong all the many strange and grotesque mammals which the study of\r\nfossils has brought to light, none can have been more remarkable than the\r\nPleistocene †glyptodonts; slow-moving hillocks they must have seemed, the\r\nlarger species 12 to 14 feet long and 5 feet or more in height. Those\r\nthat had claws on the fore feet probably used them to dig for roots and\r\ntubers, but all were plant-feeders. When attacked by the †sabre-tooth\r\ntigers (_†Smilodon_) or the great bears (_†Arctotherium_) they needed\r\nonly to squat down, bringing the edges of the carapace to the ground, and\r\ndraw in the head, to be perfectly protected, while a sweep of the spiny\r\nor club-like and horned tail would have been fatal to anything in its\r\npath.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of so many other groups, little has yet been learned\r\nregarding the history of the †glyptodonts during the interval between\r\nthe later Pliocene and the Santa Cruz; the intermediate formations have\r\nyielded many †glyptodonts, but not in such preservation as to be of any\r\nservice in this connection. We find, as might be expected, many and very\r\ngreat differences between the Pampean and the Santa Cruz representatives\r\nof the suborder, the latter being in all respects less modified and less\r\nwidely removed from the armadillos.\r\n\r\n(1) The most obvious and striking distinction was in size, the Santa Cruz\r\nforms being all small and some of them very small.\r\n\r\n(2) In all cases the carapace was made up of transverse bands, which\r\npermitted a slight degree of flexibility, and near the anterior end, at\r\nthe margins of the shell, were two or three overlapping bands. The plates\r\nwere thin and were but rarely coössified; the ornamentation was made by\r\nshallow grooves.\r\n\r\n(3) The tail-sheath, which was of very uniform character, consisted\r\nof two quite distinct portions; the anterior region consisted of 5 or\r\nmore freely movable, overlapping rings, each of two rows of plates, and\r\nin the posterior region the rings were closely fitted together, less\r\ndistinctly marked and not movable. This posterior portion was sometimes\r\nthick and ended abruptly, sometimes slender and tapering and in one genus\r\n(_†Asterostemma_) it was very armadillo-like. In none of the genera\r\nwere there any spines or horns, nor were the separate plates ever fused\r\ntogether to form a tube.\r\n\r\n(4) There was considerable variety in the head-shield, which was usually\r\nmade up of many separate plates, but in one genus (_†Eucinepeltus_) they\r\nwere coössified into a single heavy casque.\r\n\r\n(5) The teeth had a less extreme height and the four anterior ones of\r\neach jaw were much simpler than in the Pampean forms. An interesting\r\nsurvival was the retention of two minute incisors in each premaxillary\r\nbone, in one genus (_†Propalæohoplophorus_), but these were of no\r\nfunctional value and were early lost.\r\n\r\n(6) The skull was much longer, narrower and lower and had a relatively\r\nlonger facial portion; the occiput was higher and more erect, and the\r\ncondyles had no such elevation above the level of the teeth; the orbit\r\nwas widely open behind and the descending process given off from the\r\nzygomatic arch beneath the eye had no such exaggerated length; the bones\r\nwere not conspicuously inflated by sinuses. The lower jaw was shallower,\r\nthe symphysis and anterior spout shorter and the ascending portion far\r\nlower.\r\n\r\n(7) The backbone had a greater number of separate parts; the atlas, as\r\nalways, was free, the axis was fused with two or three of the following\r\nvertebræ; the sixth was free and the seventh fused with the first and\r\nsecond dorsals to form one piece, which was succeeded by two or three\r\nseparate vertebræ: the other dorsals, except the last one, were united in\r\nthe dorsal tube, and the lumbo-sacral tube was already complete. Thus,\r\ninstead of four or five, there were eight or nine distinct parts. None of\r\nthe tail-vertebræ were fused together.\r\n\r\n(8) There was the same disparity in the length of the fore and hind\r\nlimbs, but the bones were far more slender and armadillo-like; this\r\nwas especially true of the radius and humerus, the latter having\r\nwell-developed deltoid and supinator ridges and epicondylar foramen; the\r\nulna was more massive and glyptodont-like. The femur was very much more\r\nslender and rounded and the third trochanter was placed higher up the\r\nshaft; tibia and fibula were coössified at both ends and resembled those\r\nof the Pampean genera, except for their much greater slenderness.\r\n\r\n(9) The feet were much as in the latter, but relatively narrower, and the\r\nmanus had longer claws.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Santa Cruz †glyptodonts departed much less widely from\r\nthe armadillos than did the Pliocene and Pleistocene genera, and, to a\r\ncertain extent, bridged over the gap between the two suborders. Such\r\nbackward convergence in time is very strong evidence for the community of\r\norigin of the two groups.\r\n\r\nThe †glyptodonts of the more ancient formations, so far as they are\r\nknown, teach us little concerning the stages of modification in these\r\nextraordinary animals, because of their fragmentary condition. The oldest\r\nstage in which representatives of the suborder have been detected is the\r\nAstraponotus beds, which may be Oligocene or upper Eocene. On the face\r\nof the records, therefore, the †glyptodonts had no such antiquity as the\r\narmadillos.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has long been recognized that the Edentata occupy a very isolated\r\nposition among the placental mammals; their relationships to other orders\r\nand their point of departure from the main stem are unsolved problems.\r\nThe South American fossils have so far thrown little light into these\r\ndark places, but they bear very cogent witness to the unity of origin of\r\nthe five suborders, which were most probably all derived from a single\r\nearly Eocene or Paleocene group.\r\n\r\nIn the Paleocene and through most of the Eocene of North America there\r\nlived an order of mammals called the †Tæniodontia (or †Ganodonta)\r\nwhich many of the foremost palæontologists regard as an ancestral type\r\nof the Edentata, and Dr. Schlosser actually includes them in that\r\norder. That the †tæniodonts had certain striking resemblances to the\r\nedentates, especially to the †ground-sloths, is not to be denied, but\r\nthe interpretation of these resemblances is a very complex and difficult\r\nquestion. Unfortunately, no member of the order is known from an even\r\napproximately complete skeleton, and therefore a discussion of the matter\r\nhere would be unprofitable. My own conclusion, however, may be stated,\r\nto the effect that the supposed relationship of the †tæniodonts to the\r\nedentates is illusory and not real. Definite decision must await the\r\nfinding of more complete material both of the †tæniodonts and the most\r\nancient South American edentates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE MARSUPIALIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marsupials are a group of more primitive structure and greater\r\nantiquity than any which we have yet considered, so primitive, indeed,\r\nthat they are referred to a separate infraclass, the Didelphia or\r\nMetatheria. The order is one of very great variety in size, form,\r\nappearance, diet and habits, and mimics several of the higher orders in\r\nquite remarkable fashion. Herbivorous, insectivorous and carnivorous\r\nforms are all numerous, as well as arboreal, terrestrial, cursorial,\r\nleaping and burrowing genera. Some are like hoofed mammals in appearance\r\nand the Rodentia, Carnivora and Insectivora are also closely imitated in\r\nexternals. With all this diversity, most unusual within the limits of a\r\nsingle order, there is such a unity of structure, that a division of the\r\ngroup into two or more orders is impracticable.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, marsupials are very largely confined to Australia\r\nand adjoining islands, where they constitute nearly the whole mammalian\r\nfauna, and it is in the Australian region that the remarkable diversity\r\nalready mentioned is to be observed. There are found the phalangers,\r\nkangaroos, bandicoots, Tasmanian “devil” and “wolf,” and banded\r\nanteaters, not to mention many other curious creatures. In the western\r\nhemisphere only the opossums (_Didelphis_, _Chironectes_) and one very\r\ninteresting relic of a long vanished assemblage, _Cænolestes_ of Ecuador\r\nand Colombia, are in existence to-day. The opossums, of which some\r\ntwenty-three species are recognized, have their headquarters in South\r\nAmerica, to which nearly all of the species are confined, North America\r\nhaving but two or three.\r\n\r\nThe more important American marsupials are given in the table below:\r\n\r\n  Suborder POLYPROTODONTA\r\n\r\n    I.

There is a difference of opinion among\r\nnaturalists as to the proper interpretation of the marsupial dentition.\r\nAccording to one view, all except the replaced premolar belong to the\r\nmilk-series and the permanent series has been lost; the alternative\r\nand more probable belief is that the milk-dentition has been almost or\r\ncompletely suppressed. Whichever one of these interpretations be the\r\nright one, there is strong reason to maintain that the very limited\r\namount of change is not a primitive condition, but a secondary one,\r\nfor a series of rudimentary teeth is formed before those which are to\r\nbecome functional. The only reasonable explanation of such a condition\r\nis that it has been derived from one in which the normal succession and\r\nreplacement of the teeth took place. Something of the same sort has been\r\nobserved in the simplicidentate rodents. The marsupial dentition differs\r\nfrom the placental one in the usual number of four molars, instead of\r\nthree, and frequently also in exceeding the normal total number of 44.\r\nThe incisors are almost always of a different number in the upper and the\r\nlower jaw and are frequently more numerous than in the placentals.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton has several diagnostic characters, which are present\r\nthroughout the order, though one or other of these features may be absent\r\nin particular instances. The skull has a very small brain-capacity and\r\nelongate face and jaws. In the placental mammals, the sutures between\r\nadjoining bones of the skull tend to close by coössification, and the\r\nseparate bones are clearly distinguishable only in young animals; but\r\nin the marsupials the sutures remain open for a much longer period.\r\nThe lachrymal is expanded on the face and the foramen is outside of\r\nthe orbit. The tympanic is a mere ring and permanently separate from\r\nthe other bones of the cranium, while a false bulla is formed by the\r\ninflation of part of the alisphenoid. In almost all marsupials there\r\nare large openings or vacuities in the bony palate. One of the most\r\ncharacteristic and constant features of the marsupial skull is in the\r\nconformation of the angle of the lower jaw, which is turned inward, or\r\n_inflected_, at nearly a right angle with the body of the jaw. It is true\r\nthat one existing Australian genus has lost this character; and in some\r\nof the placental orders, especially the Rodentia, a somewhat similar\r\nstructure may occasionally be found, but it is never quite the same as in\r\nthe marsupials, in which it goes back to a remote antiquity.\r\n\r\nThere are very constantly 19 trunk-vertebræ, of which usually 13 are\r\ndorsals. The tail differs greatly in length in the various genera, but\r\nmost of them have well-developed tails. An additional pair of elements,\r\nbesides the three which are found in the placentals, enter into the\r\ncomposition of the hip-bones; these are the _marsupial bones_, slender,\r\nflattened rods, directed forward in the abdominal wall and diverging\r\nin V-shape. Save in a few genera, clavicles are present and of full\r\nsize. The humerus may or may not have the epicondylar foramen, but the\r\nfemur never has the third trochanter. The feet vary greatly in form and\r\nstructure, in accordance with the habits, but there is a very widespread\r\nadaptation to an arboreal life, and even in terrestrial and burrowing\r\nforms more or less distinct traces of this arboreal adaptation may be\r\nnoted. This fact has led to a generally accepted inference that all\r\nexisting marsupials had an arboreal ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe soft parts and more especially the organs of reproduction are\r\nlikewise very characteristic, and one or two of these peculiarities may\r\nbe mentioned. (1) In the female, the vagina is double and on the abdomen\r\nis the pouch, or _marsupium_ (which gives its name to the order), a\r\nhair-lined bag, opening either forward or backward, which serves to carry\r\nthe young and into which the teats open. A considerable number of species\r\nhave lost the marsupium, while other species of the same genera retain\r\nit, and there can be little question that its absence is a secondary\r\ncondition. (2) Except in one modern Australian genus, the marsupials\r\nhave no true placenta, and the young are born in a very immature state,\r\nincapable of even swallowing. The new-born young are transferred to the\r\nnipples of the mother and are attached to these and fed by the pumping\r\nof milk into their mouths by muscular action of the mother. A special,\r\nthough temporary, arrangement of the gullet and windpipe is provided, so\r\nthat the helpless young animal shall not be suffocated by the entrance of\r\nmilk into the lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER POLYPROTODONTA\r\n\r\nThis suborder, as is indicated by its name, is characterized by its\r\nnumerous incisors, which are 5/4, or 4/3, and none of them is especially\r\nenlarged; by the large canines in both jaws, simple premolars and\r\ntritubercular upper molars. The members of this group are carnivorous\r\nor insectivorous in habit, and all the existing ones are of small or\r\nmoderate size, though some very large extinct forms are known. Except\r\nin one Australian family, the feet are not “syndactyl,” a term which\r\nmeans the enclosure of two or more digits in one fold of skin. The only\r\nexisting American representatives of the suborder are the opossums, the\r\ngreat majority of which are Neotropical in distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Didelphiidæ. Opossums_\r\n\r\nIn this family the dental formula is: _i_ 5/4, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 3/3,\r\n_m_ 4/4, × 2 = 50. The incisors are small and closely crowded\r\ntogether, the canines large and tusk-like, the premolars simple and\r\nof compressed-conical form; in existing species, the upper molars are\r\ntriangular, each of the three main cusps is V-shaped and there are\r\nadditional minute cusps along the outer border; the lower molars have a\r\nhigh anterior triangle of three pointed cusps and a low heel with several\r\ndistinct cusps. The humerus has an epicondylar foramen and the feet are\r\nfive-toed; in the manus all the digits are armed with claws and the thumb\r\nis but partially opposable, while in the pes the hallux is without a claw\r\nand completely opposable, making the foot much like that of a monkey.\r\n\r\nThe division of the existing opossums into genera has caused much\r\ndifference of opinion and practice among naturalists; there are five\r\ngroups, which by some are regarded as genera, and by others as subgenera,\r\nall modern members of the family being very much alike. The species\r\n_Didelphis marsupialis_, which is common in the eastern United States\r\nand extends through temperate North America, Central America and\r\ntropical South America, has a complete pouch and is chiefly arboreal\r\nand insectivorous in habit. In the woolly opossums (_Caluromys_) there\r\nis no pouch, and the young, when sufficiently advanced, are carried on\r\nthe mother’s back, winding their tails around hers. In both of these\r\ngenera the tail is long, naked and prehensile, but in the tiny species\r\nof _Peramys_ the tail is short and hairy. Another Neotropical genus,\r\n_Chironectes_, the Yapock or Water Opossum, is the only existing instance\r\nof an aquatic marsupial. It has light grey fur, striped with brown, and\r\nwebbed hind feet; living chiefly in the water, it feeds upon crayfish,\r\nwater-insects and small fish.\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the modern North American opossums is a matter of\r\ngreat uncertainty. The present distribution of the family, with by far\r\nthe greater number of its species confined to the Neotropical region, is\r\ncertainly suggestive of a South American origin, but such considerations\r\nare very untrustworthy guides in tracing the history of animal groups.\r\nNo opossum has been found in any North American formation between the\r\nPleistocene and the lower Oligocene, though in the case of such small\r\nanimals, negative evidence must be accepted with caution. In the White\r\nRiver Oligocene many minute opossums have been found and referred to\r\nthe European genus _†Peratherium_, though it so closely resembles the\r\nmodern _Didelphis_ that many systematists do not make the distinction.\r\nIn the Eocene, Paleocene and upper Cretaceous, opossums were represented\r\ndoubtfully; the material is too incomplete for assured determination; in\r\nEurope they existed in the Oligocene and upper Eocene. In South America\r\nthe family went back uninterruptedly to the oldest mammal-bearing beds\r\nof Patagonia, which may be upper Cretaceous. The opossums are thus the\r\nremnants of an exceedingly ancient group, whose beginnings are to be\r\nsought in the Mesozoic era and which was probably spread over all the\r\ncontinents. To all appearances, the whole group vanished completely from\r\nthe northern hemisphere, but reëntered North America from the south\r\nat some time during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene and permanently\r\nestablished itself here.\r\n\r\nThe opossums are the most primitive of existing marsupials, especially\r\nthe little South American genus, _Marmosa_, and are regarded, by some\r\nof the most competent students of the order, as closely representing\r\nthe ancestral type of all the Recent families and genera, both of the\r\nPolyprotodonta and Diprotodonta.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Thylacynidæ. Predaceous Marsupials_\r\n\r\nBy many naturalists this group of flesh-eating forms is included in the\r\nDasyuridæ. The family never entered North America, but played a very\r\nimportant part in the Tertiary of South America. Three existing genera of\r\nthe Australian region throw considerable light upon the South American\r\ntypes, and therefore some account of them will not be out of place here.\r\n\r\nThe largest of modern predaceous marsupials is the animal (_Thylacynus\r\ncynocephalus_) erroneously, but very naturally, called the “Tasmanian\r\nWolf,” now confined to Tasmania, but occurring also in the Pleistocene\r\nof Australia. As “wolf” applied to a marsupial is misleading, it will\r\nbe less confusing to employ the anglicized form of the generic name\r\n“Thylacine.” This animal is of the size of the small Prairie Wolf or\r\nCoyote (_Canis latrans_) and has very wolf-like appearance and habits.\r\nThe muzzle is long and pointed, the ears erect and rather small, the tail\r\nlong, very thick at the base and tapering to the end, not bushy, but\r\ncovered with short, close-set hairs; the colour is greyish brown, with\r\ndark, transverse stripes on the posterior half of the back and base of\r\nthe tail. Apparently the creature is in process of losing its stripes and\r\nacquiring the solid body-colour. The dental formula is: _i_ 4/3, _c_ 1/1,\r\n_p_ 2/2, _m_ 4/4, × 2 = 46; the incisors are small, the canines large\r\nfangs, and the premolars simple; the upper molars are tritubercular,\r\nwith large inner cusp and postero-external cutting ridge, and the lower\r\nmolars are trenchant, with low heel. The whole dentition is remarkably\r\nlike that of many Eocene †creodonts, such as _†Sinopa_ and _†Tritemnodon_\r\n(see p. 566). The milk-premolar is small and functionless and is shed\r\nvery early. The skull is very wolf-like in appearance, but thoroughly\r\nmarsupial in structure, and has the large palatal vacuities common in\r\nthe order. The marsupial bones do not ossify and are evidently on the\r\npoint of disappearance. There are five digits in the manus, four in the\r\npes, the hallux being completely suppressed. In habits, the Thylacine\r\nis carnivorous and so destructive to sheep that the farmers have nearly\r\nexterminated it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 296.—Thylacine, or “Tasmanian Wolf” (_Thylacynus\r\ncynocephalus_).—By permission of W. S. Berridge, London.]\r\n\r\nThe other forms to be mentioned belong to the closely allied family of\r\nthe Dasyuridæ. The “Tasmanian Devil” (_Sarcophilus ursinus_) is now, like\r\nthe Thylacine, confined to Tasmania, but remains of it have been found in\r\nthe Australian Pleistocene; it has one less premolar in each jaw, giving\r\nthe formula: _i_ 4/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 2/2, _m_ 4/4, × 2 = 42; there is no\r\nmilk-tooth. The premolars are closely crowded and the molars resemble\r\nthose of the Thylacine in construction, but are broader and heavier. The\r\nskull is disproportionately large, with shorter and wider muzzle and jaws\r\nthan in the Thylacine; the tail is of only moderate length and somewhat\r\nshaggy; the hallux is wanting. In size and build, the Tasmanian Devil\r\nresembles a badger and has long and heavy fossorial claws on the fore\r\nfeet; the hair is rough and shaggy, black in colour with white patches.\r\nThe animal has received its name from its fierce and savage disposition\r\nand is almost as destructive to sheep as the Thylacine.\r\n\r\nThe five species of _Dasyurus_ are distributed through Tasmania,\r\nAustralia and New Guinea and are called “Native Cats”; they are much\r\nsmaller animals than the two preceding genera, not exceeding a domestic\r\ncat in size. As the Thylacine imitates a wolf and the Tasmanian Devil\r\na badger, the dasyures resemble the civets. In them the dental formula\r\nis the same as in _Sarcophilus_, but the teeth have higher and sharper\r\ncusps. The head has a narrow, tapering muzzle and narrow ears; the body\r\nis long and the tail of moderate length. The limbs are short and slender\r\nand a small hallux is present in some of the species. The fur is grey or\r\nbrown, with numerous white spots, and the tail is covered with long hair,\r\nbut not bushy. The dasyures are largely arboreal and prey upon small\r\nmammals, birds and eggs.\r\n\r\nUntil the arrival of the true Carnivora from the north, their rôle was\r\ntaken in South America by predaceous marsupials, which persisted as\r\nlate as the presumably Pliocene beds of Monte Hermoso. Little is known\r\nof them in that stage, however, or in the older Paraná, but abundant\r\nmaterial representing those of the Santa Cruz has been collected.\r\nAmong these there was a considerable range of size and some variety of\r\nstructure, and they all differed in certain respects from the modern\r\nAustralian genera, differences which have led some authorities to\r\ndeny the marsupial character of all these South American forms. The\r\ndifferences are of three kinds: (1) there are no vacuities in the bony\r\npalate; (2) the milk-dentition is less reduced, the canines and one or\r\ntwo premolars being changed; (3) the enamel of the teeth, in the only\r\ngenus (_†Borhyæna_) which has been examined microscopically, resembles\r\nin its minute features that of the placentals and lacks the marsupial\r\ncharacters. Though by no means unimportant, these differences are\r\naltogether outweighed by the thoroughly marsupial nature of all other\r\nparts of the skeleton, and I cannot but agree with Dr. Sinclair[20] in\r\nincluding them in the same family with the Tasmanian Thylacine.\r\n\r\nThe genus _†Prothylacynus_ was especially like the latter and must have\r\nhad a very similar appearance, though in the restoration (Fig. 297)\r\nthe colour-pattern is changed to one of longitudinal stripes, as more\r\nprobably pertaining to so ancient and primitive a form. The humerus had\r\nthe epicondylar foramen, and a large vestige of the hallux was retained,\r\nthough it could not have been visible in the living animal.\r\n\r\nA more specialized Santa Cruz genus was _†Borhyæna_ (Fig. 244, p. 494),\r\nan animal of about the same length and height as _†Prothylacynus_\r\nand the Thylacine, but much more massive and powerful. The skull was\r\nremarkable for the small size of the brain-case and the great spread of\r\nthe zygomatic arches, which gave a rounded and almost cat-like appearance\r\nto the head, as is shown in the restoration (Fig. 244). In this genus\r\nthe upper incisors were reduced to three, a very unusual thing among\r\nthe Polyprotodonta, and the humerus had lost the epicondylar foramen.\r\n_†Prothylacynus_ and _†Borhyæna_ were the largest of the Santa Cruz\r\nflesh-eaters and no doubt pursued the smaller and more defenceless\r\nungulates, but were hardly sufficiently powerful to attack successfully\r\nthe larger hoofed animals, which were probably well able to defend\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 297.—Santa Cruz predaceous marsupial (_†Prothylacynus\r\npatagonicus_) and †typothere (_†Interatherium robustum_). Restored by C.\r\nKnight from skeletons in the museum of Princeton University.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 298.—Skull of _†Borhyæna_, Santa Cruz. (After\r\nSinclair, Reports Princeton University Expeditions to Patagonia, Vol.\r\nIV.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 299.—Skull of small predaceous marsupial\r\n(_†Amphiproviverra manzaniana_), showing the punctured wound from a bite.\r\nPrinceton University Museum.]\r\n\r\nAssociated with these larger predaceous marsupials were several much\r\nsmaller kinds, ranging in size from a fox to a weasel, which must have\r\npreyed upon the abundant rodents and other small mammals and birds.\r\nOne of these (_†Amphiproviverra_) had an opposable hallux, somewhat as\r\nin the opossums, and was therefore probably arboreal. An interesting\r\nspecimen in the museum of Princeton University illustrates the pugnacity\r\nof these small creatures; it is a skull in which the left upper canine\r\nwas completely torn out, the circular puncture of the enemy’s bite being\r\nunmistakable and the healed edges of the wound proving that the loss of\r\nthe tooth was suffered during life. In structure, these smaller animals\r\ndiffered so little from the larger ones, that no particular description\r\nof them is needed. In the restoration of _†Cladosictis_ (Fig. 300) the\r\nspotted pattern of the Australian dasyures, or native cats, has been\r\ntaken as a model.\r\n\r\nIn the Deseado formation the predaceous marsupials have been less\r\nabundantly found than in the Santa Cruz and there can be little doubt\r\nthat the group is very inadequately represented by the material so far\r\ncollected. Only two genera, known from lower jaws, have been described,\r\nbut one of these (_†Proborhyæna_) is of interest because of its enormous\r\nsize, far surpassing any of the Santa Cruz forms and equalling the\r\nlargest modern bears. This is another illustration of the unusual\r\nrelationship between the Deseado and Santa Cruz faunas, the older stage\r\nso frequently having the larger animals.\r\n\r\nPredaceous marsupials of small size may be traced back to the Casa Mayor\r\nformation, but very little is yet known of them. There is no obvious\r\ndifficulty in the way of their derivation from opossum-like forms, such\r\nas are found in the Cretaceous of North America and probably of South\r\nAmerica also.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the South American to the Australian marsupials\r\noffers problems of unusual interest, a discussion of which would be\r\nimpracticable here. Several alternative solutions of the problem have\r\nbeen offered and great differences of opinion exist with regard to it.\r\nTo my mind the most probable suggestion is that a land-connection, by\r\nway of the Antarctic continent, existed in early Tertiary times, by\r\nmeans of which the ancestors of the Australian marsupials migrated, from\r\nSouth America, though this explanation is rejected by several eminent\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 300.—Small predaceous marsupial (_†Cladosictis\r\nlustratus_) and rabbit-like †typothere (_†Pachyrukhos moyani_), Santa\r\nCruz stage. Restored by C. Knight from skeletons in Princeton University\r\nand the American Museum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER DIPROTODONTA\r\n\r\nNorth America never had any representatives of this suborder, but South\r\nAmerica possessed many of them in the Santa Cruz Miocene and one genus\r\n(_Cænolestes_) has survived to the present time. Australia, on the other\r\nhand, has three well-defined families of the suborder, the kangaroos,\r\nphalangers and wombats, but no member of any of these has ever been found\r\noutside of the Australian region. So far as we know, therefore, the\r\nsuborder is and always has been confined to the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 301.—Skull of _Cænolestes obscurus_, enlarged. (After\r\nSinclair.)]\r\n\r\nThe modern South American genus _Cænolestes_ is a small, rat-like animal\r\nand very rare; it has been found only in Ecuador and Colombia. Its\r\ndentition is not at all typically diprotodont, but rather intermediate in\r\ncharacter between the latter and the Polyprotodonta. The dental formula\r\nis: _i_ 4/3, _c_ 1/1, _p_ 3/3, _m_ 4/4, × 2 = 46. The upper incisors are\r\nsmall and of subequal size, though the second is somewhat the largest\r\nof the series, and the canine is considerably larger and more prominent\r\nthan any of them. The foremost lower incisor is long and pointed and\r\ndirected almost straight forward; the other lower incisors and the canine\r\nare minute and can have little or no functional value. The premolars are\r\nsmall and simple and the upper molars quadritubercular, the third one\r\ntriangular, and the fourth very small and apparently about to disappear.\r\nSuch teeth would seem to indicate a vegetable diet, but it is reported\r\nthat the animal subsists chiefly upon small birds and their eggs. The\r\nskull, which is typically marsupial in all its characters, is most like\r\nthat of the smaller Australian native cats (Dasyuridæ) and the feet show\r\nno signs of the syndactyly which all the other diprotodonts display so\r\nclearly. Dr. Gregory is “inclined to regard _Cænolestes_ and its allies\r\nas an independent suborder, an offshoot of primitive Polyprotodonts\r\nwhich has paralleled the Diprotodonts in certain characters of the\r\ndentition.”[21]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 302.—Lower jaws of Santa Cruz cænolestids, enlarged.\r\n_A_, _†Garzonia patagonica_. _B_, _†Abderites crassignathus_. _C_,\r\n_†Callomenus ligatus_. (After Sinclair, in Reports Princeton University\r\nExpeditions to Patagonia, Vol. IV.)]\r\n\r\nEvidently, the animals of this series were extremely rare or absent in\r\nthe areas where the known South American deposits of the Pleistocene\r\nand Pliocene were laid down, for there is a very long hiatus in their\r\nhistory from the Recent to the Santa Cruz, during which none has yet\r\nbeen found, except one genus (_†Zygolestes_) in the Paraná. In the Santa\r\nCruz, however, there was a great abundance of these little marsupials,\r\nto which various generic names have been given and which displayed\r\nconsiderable variety in the forms of the teeth. Some (e.g. _†Garzonia_)\r\nagreed with _Cænolestes_ in having no trenchant shearing teeth; behind\r\nthe large, procumbent lower incisor, followed four or five very minute\r\nteeth, which must have been nearly or quite functionless, succeeded\r\nby the well-developed molars. Other genera (_e.g._ _†Abderites_) had\r\na similar dentition, with the important exception that the last upper\r\npremolar and first lower molar were enlarged and trenchant, together\r\nforming a shearing pair; these teeth were vertically fluted or ribbed in\r\nvery characteristic fashion. The Australian phalangers have very similar\r\ntrenchant and fluted teeth, but in that family the lower one of the pair\r\nis the last premolar, not the first molar. Marsupials of this type have\r\nnot been found in formations older than the Deseado.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of these South American genera to the Australian\r\nphalangers is a very interesting question from the standpoint of\r\nmammalian distribution, but is not likely to receive a positive answer\r\nuntil something is learned regarding the history of the Australian family.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER †ALLOTHERIA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 303.—Skull of Paleocene †allothere (_†Ptilodus\r\ngracilis_), enlarged, Fort Union stage. (After Gidley.)]\r\n\r\nThis extinct suborder is still very imperfectly understood, for it is\r\nknown almost exclusively from jaws and teeth; so far, the skull of one\r\ngenus and most of that of another have been obtained, but hardly anything\r\nof the skeleton. The †Allotheria were small or minute marsupials,\r\nherbivorous or omnivorous, which had lost all trace of the canines and\r\nhad one pair of incisors above and below, which grew from persistent\r\npulps and had a scalpriform, rodent-like character. The molars were\r\ncomposed of numerous tubercles (whence the name “†Multituberculata,”\r\noften applied to the group) arranged in two or three longitudinal rows,\r\nand the premolars were either like the molars, but of simpler pattern,\r\nor compressed, sharp-edged and trenchant. The †Allotheria were among the\r\nmost ancient of mammals and have been found in the Triassic of Europe,\r\nthe Jurassic of Europe and South Africa, the Jurassic and Cretaceous\r\nof North America and the Paleocene of both northern continents, while\r\nthe South American Eocene (Casa Mayor) had certain problematical genera\r\n(†Polydolopidæ), which may be referable to the †Allotheria or to the\r\n_Cænolestes_ series. The suborder was thus preëminently a Mesozoic one\r\nand, with the doubtful exception of South America, it is not known to\r\nhave passed beyond the limits of the Paleocene. There is not the least\r\nlikelihood that any existing mammals were derived from the †Allotheria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 304.—Head of _†Ptilodus gracilis_, about natural\r\nsize. Restored from a skull in the United States National Museum.]\r\n\r\nWhile the †Allotheria have an antiquity at least equal to that of\r\nany other mammals known, there were other groups in the Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous, which, so far as may be judged from teeth alone, would seem\r\nto have been ancestral to the other marsupials and to the placentals. It\r\nwould serve no useful purpose to describe these minute creatures, which\r\nare so very incompletely known, though to the specialist they are of the\r\nhighest interest. The genera found in the Triassic of North Carolina may\r\nor may not represent the primitive mammalian stock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin of the Mammalia is still involved in great\r\nobscurity, and the most divergent opinions are held concerning it. It\r\nremains an unsolved problem whether the mammals were all descended from\r\na common stock, or have been derived from two independent lines of\r\nancestry, or, in technical phrase, whether the class is monophyletic or\r\ndiphyletic. Assuming, as seems most probable from present knowledge,\r\nthat the mammals are monophyletic, the question next arises: From what\r\nlower vertebrates are they descended? A great controversial literature\r\nhas grown up around this problem, one party regarding the Amphibia\r\nand the other the Reptilia as the parent group. The palæontological\r\nevidence, while not conclusive, is decidedly in favour of the latter\r\nview. In the Triassic of South Africa is found a group of reptiles which\r\napproximated the mammals very much more closely than do any other known\r\nrepresentatives of the lower vertebrates. While it is not believed that\r\nany of these Triassic reptiles were directly ancestral to the mammals,\r\nthey did, to a very great extent, bridge the gap between the two classes\r\nand show us what the reptilian ancestors of the mammals were probably\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nWith perhaps the exception of certain Insectivora, the Paleocene faunas\r\ncontained few, if any, ancestors of modern mammals. These originated\r\nin some region which has not been identified, but may be plausibly\r\nconjectured to be central Asia, whence they migrated westward to Europe\r\nand eastward to North America, reaching both of those continents in\r\nthe lower Eocene. From that time onward they increased and multiplied,\r\nbecoming more and more differentiated through divergent evolution, until\r\nthe existing state of things was attained. From the lower Eocene we\r\nare on firm ground, and, though very much remains to be learned, much\r\nhas already been accomplished in the way of tracing the history and\r\ndevelopment of many mammalian orders. It has been my endeavour in the\r\nbody of this book to sketch the better established and more significant\r\nparts of this marvellous story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nMODES OF MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout this book the theory of evolution has been taken for granted,\r\nas it seemed superfluous to present an outline of the evidence upon\r\nwhich that theory rests. “Descent with modification” is now accepted\r\namong naturalists with almost complete unanimity, but, unfortunately\r\nor otherwise, this general agreement does not extend beyond the point\r\nof believing that the present organic world has arisen by descent from\r\nsimpler and simpler forms. The application of the theory to concrete\r\ncases is beset with grave difficulties and gives rise to the most\r\ndivergent views. The uninitiated reader who takes up a treatise upon\r\nsome animal group may well be surprised to see the apparently minute\r\naccuracy with which the genealogy of the series is set forth and the\r\ncomplex relationships of its members marshalled in orderly array. Another\r\ntreatise on the same subject, however, while agreeing perfectly with the\r\nfirst as to the facts, will contradict its conclusions in almost every\r\nparticular. Indeed, so notorious did this become, that “phylogenetic\r\ntrees” were rather a laughing-stock, and most naturalists lost interest\r\nin the problems of phylogeny and turned to fields that seemed more\r\npromising.\r\n\r\nTo some extent, this almost hopeless divergence is inherent in the very\r\nnature of the problem, which deals with the value of evidence and the\r\nbalancing of probabilities, as to which men must be expected to differ;\r\nbut there is another and more potent cause of the discrepancy. When the\r\ncontradictory schemes are analyzed, it is seen that each is founded upon\r\ncertain assumptions regarding the evolutionary process, assumptions\r\nwhich are generally implicit and often apparently unconscious. In the\r\npresent state of knowledge, these postulates are, for the most part,\r\nmatters of judgment, incapable of definite proof, and they appeal with\r\nvery different force to different minds; what to one seems almost\r\nself-evident, another regards as all but impossible. It will, however,\r\nbe of service to examine such of these postulates as are involved in\r\nmammalian history.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impracticable to construct a genetic series without making\r\ncertain assumptions as to the manner in which the developmental process\r\noperated and the kinds of modification that actually did occur. In the\r\npreceding chapters, which deal with the evolutionary history of various\r\nmammalian groups, it was repeatedly stated that, of two contemporary\r\ngenera, one was to be taken as the ancestor of some later form and the\r\nother regarded as a collateral branch, but it was also pointed out that\r\nin certain cases, palæontologists differed more or less decidedly as to\r\nthe proper interpretation of the facts; it is just this lack of agreement\r\nas to the modes and processes of change that forms the root of the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThere are instructive analogies between the history, aims and methods of\r\ncomparative philology, on the one hand, and zoölogy, on the other. In\r\nboth sciences the attempt is made to trace the development of the modern\r\nfrom the ancient, to demonstrate the common origin of things which are\r\nnow widely separated and differ in all obvious characteristics, and to\r\ndetermine the manner in which these cumulative modifications have been\r\neffected. At the present time zoölogy is still far behind the science of\r\nlanguage with regard to the solution of many of these kindred problems\r\nand has hardly advanced beyond the stage which called forth Voltaire’s\r\nfamous sneer: “L’étymologie est une science ou les voyelles ne font rien\r\net les consonnes fort peu de chose.” Many of the animal genealogies\r\nwhich have been proposed have no better foundation than the “guessing\r\netymologies” of the eighteenth century, and for exactly the same reason.\r\nJust as the old etymologists made their derivations upon the basis of\r\na likeness of sound and meaning in the words compared, so the modern\r\nzoölogist, in attempting to trace the relationships of animals, must\r\nproceed by balancing their similarities and differences of structure. The\r\netymologist had no sure test for distinguishing a true derivation from\r\na plausible but false one, and the zoölogist finds himself in the same\r\npredicament. How much weight should be allowed to a given likeness and\r\nhow far it is offset by an accompanying difference, there are no certain\r\nmeans of determining, and we are still in search of those laws of organic\r\nchange which shall render such service to zoölogy as Grimm’s law did to\r\nthe study of the Indo-European languages. Doubtless, the analogy may be\r\npushed still farther, and it may be confidently assumed that, just as\r\nsound principles of etymology were established by tracing the changes of\r\nwords step by step from their modern forms to their ancient origins, so\r\nthe existing animal forms must be traced back through the intermediate\r\ngradations to their distant ancestors, before the modes of organic\r\ndevelopment can be deduced from well-ascertained facts.\r\n\r\nThe evolutionary problem has been attacked by the aid of several distinct\r\nmethods, each of which has its particular advantages and its peculiar\r\nlimitations and drawbacks. Most of the methods suffer from the fact that\r\nthey deal only with the present order of things, and thus resemble the\r\nattempt to work out the derivations of languages that have no literature\r\nto register their changes.\r\n\r\n(1) Of necessity, the oldest of these methods is Comparative Anatomy,\r\nwhich had made great advances in pre-Darwinian days. It is the\r\nindispensable foundation of the whole inquiry, for an accurate knowledge\r\nof Comparative Anatomy is absolutely necessary to the use of the other\r\nmethods; in the hands of the great masters it has registered many notable\r\ntriumphs in determining the mutual relationships of animal groups; but\r\nfinality cannot be reached by this method, because it deals only with\r\nexisting forms and possesses no sure criterion for determining the value\r\nof similarities. It is thus unable to distinguish with certainty between\r\nthose resemblances which are due to inheritance from a common ancestry\r\nand those which have been independently acquired. It is a very frequent\r\nfallacy to assume that, because two allied groups, B and C, possess a\r\ncertain structure, their common ancestor, A, must also have possessed it.\r\nThis may or may not have been the case, and Comparative Anatomy offers no\r\nassured means of deciding between those alternatives or of confidently\r\ndistinguishing primitive characters from degenerative or retrograde\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n(2) Embryology, which is the study of the development of the individual\r\nanimal from the unfertilized egg to the adult condition, was long\r\nregarded as the infallible test of theoretical views in zoölogy. This\r\nwas on the assumption that individual development (_ontogeny_) is a\r\nrecapitulation in abbreviated form of the ancestral history (_phylogeny_)\r\nof the species, and was called by Haeckel “the fundamental biogenetic\r\nlaw.” It was soon learned, however, that the “recapitulation theory” was\r\nnot to be implicitly trusted, for structural features which could not\r\npossibly be a part of ancestral history were imposed upon or substituted\r\nfor those due to phylogenetic inheritance. Now the whole theory is\r\nstrongly questioned, and the absence of any universally accepted rules\r\nof interpretation, by which the contradictory embryological data may\r\nbe harmonized into a consistent whole, has deprived the method of that\r\nauthoritative character once so generally ascribed to it. It is like\r\ndealing with a literature which has been vitiated with many forgeries,\r\nonly the grossest of which can be readily detected. Embryology has\r\nrendered many great services in the solution of zoölogical problems and\r\nwill no doubt render many more, but it cannot, of itself, reach final\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n(3) Experimental Zoölogy, especially that part known as “Genetics,” one\r\nof the newest and most promising provinces of the science, has already\r\ntaught us much concerning the laws of inheritance and the manner in\r\nwhich new characters arise, and no one can venture to fix the limits of\r\nits possible results. On the other hand, it does not seem likely that\r\nthe larger problems of relationship and classification can be solved by\r\nthis method, because of the brief time which the shortness of human life\r\nallows for the experiments.\r\n\r\n(4) Palæontology suffers from the drawback that much of the past\r\nhistory of life is irretrievably lost, and even when the record is\r\nremarkably complete, as it is for certain chapters of the history, the\r\nmaterial is but partially preserved. With such rare exceptions as are of\r\nlittle practical importance, only the hard parts, bones, teeth, etc.,\r\nare retained and the soft parts completely destroyed. Nevertheless,\r\nPalæontology has the preëminent advantage of offering to the student\r\nthe actual stages of development, and thus, to recur to the simile of\r\nlanguage, has preserved original documents and in the true order of\r\nsuccession. It is true that it is well-nigh impossible to reconstruct a\r\nphylogenetic series of ancestor and descendant, unaffected by theoretical\r\npreconceptions, and the differences which arise in the interpretation of\r\nundisputed facts are caused by divergent beliefs concerning the actual\r\ncourse of the evolutionary process. If final and definitive results are\r\never to be reached, it must be through the coöperation of all the methods\r\nof research, and such results must be able to stand the tests applied by\r\nevery sound method. On the other hand, the study of those phylogenetic\r\nseries which are generally accepted as well established, should furnish\r\nus with some fairly definite information as to the modes in which\r\ndevelopment has operated in the past, since the order of succession in\r\ntime fixes a limit to the rearrangement of related series. Some of the\r\nconclusions thus suggested may be stated here.\r\n\r\nI. One of the most fundamental problems concerning the course of\r\ndevelopment is that which deals with _parallel_ and _convergent\r\nevolution_. The term _parallelism_ implies that forms having a common\r\norigin may independently run through a similar course of development and\r\narrive at similar results. Illustrations of this principle are given by\r\nthe many phyla of horses, rhinoceroses and camels, which persisted side\r\nby side through several geological stages, following independent, but\r\nparallel, courses of change. An even more striking case is that of the\r\ntwo subfamilies of the cats, the true felines and the †sabre-tooths.\r\nWhatever view may be taken of the relationships of these two groups, it\r\nis clear that, at least from the upper Oligocene to the Pleistocene, they\r\nwere separate, but kept remarkably even pace with each other in their\r\nadvance and specialization.\r\n\r\nBy _convergence_ is meant a similar result which is reached by two or\r\nmore independent lines having different starting points, so that the\r\ndescendants are more alike than were the ancestors, and is thus the\r\nopposite of _divergence_, the result of which is to make the descendants\r\nof common ancestors less and less alike with each succeeding stage.\r\nEither parallelism or convergence may be involved in the independent\r\nacquisition of similar characters, of which these are so many examples.\r\nIt is obvious that this problem is fundamental and that little real\r\nprogress is possible until a solution is reached. As to the correct\r\nsolution, there is much difference of opinion among naturalists. Some\r\ndeny altogether the reality and importance of these modes of development,\r\nbut such are almost exclusively concerned with the modern world; others\r\ngo to the opposite extreme, and looking upon every large group as\r\npolyphyletic, consider parallel and convergent development to be the\r\nrule of evolution. Few palæontologists are disposed to doubt that these\r\nmodes of evolution are very frequent; their difficulty is to determine\r\nwhat limits can be drawn, and this difficulty can be removed only by much\r\nwider and more exact knowledge than we now possess.\r\n\r\nSo far as single structures are concerned, the fossils demonstrate\r\nunequivocally that they have been independently acquired in a great many\r\ncases. The resultant similarity may be attained through the loss, the\r\nacquisition or the modification of parts. The reduction of toes from the\r\nprimitive number of five to four, three, two, or even one, has happened\r\nover and over again in the most diverse groups. There is good reason to\r\nbelieve that all the early and primitive placental mammals had the third\r\ntrochanter on the femur and the epicondylar foramen on the humerus, but\r\nin most of the modern groups these structures are lost; and the list of\r\nsuch similar reductions of parts might be almost indefinitely extended.\r\n\r\nOf much greater significance is the independent similar modification\r\nof parts and acquisition of new structures. Innumerable examples of\r\nthis kind of parallel and convergent development might be given, but a\r\nfew will be sufficient to illustrate the principle. (1) The odontoid\r\nprocess of the axis (second vertebra of the neck) was primitively\r\na bluntly conical peg, a form which is still retained in the great\r\nmajority of mammals, but in the true ruminants, the camels, the horses\r\nand the tapirs, the process is spout-shaped, concave on the upper side,\r\nconvex on the lower. By tracing the development of those groups, it\r\nhas been conclusively demonstrated that the change of form took place\r\nindependently in each of the four. (2) The ruminants have molar teeth\r\ncomposed of four crescentic cusps arranged in two transverse pairs,\r\nthe pattern called _selenodont_. The evidence is very strong that this\r\nhighly characteristic molar pattern has been several times independently\r\nrepeated, as in the true ruminants, the camels, the †oreodonts and\r\nprobably other groups also. (3) The family †Macrauchenidæ of the extinct\r\n†Litopterna shares with the camel tribe the remarkable peculiarity of\r\nhaving the canal for the vertebral artery running through the neural\r\narches of the neck-vertebræ. (4) A very striking instance is afforded by\r\nthe three widely separated groups of hoofed animals, members of which had\r\ntheir hoofs transformed into claws; the †chalicotheres arose from the\r\nnormal perissodactyls (p. 356), the †agriochœrids from the †oreodonts\r\nand the †Entelonychia from the †toxodonts. From time to time attempts\r\nhave been made to unite two or more of these groups, but in each case\r\nbetter material and fuller knowledge have demonstrated the unnatural\r\ncharacter of such association and the separate origin of the peculiar\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the reality and frequency of these modes of development, a\r\nfar more difficult problem is to determine the extent to which such\r\nindependent acquisition of similar structures has actually been carried,\r\nand it is at this point that the widest divergences of opinion are to be\r\nfound. As yet, our knowledge is far too imperfect to permit the making\r\nof positive statements, but there is no evidence which would justify the\r\nconclusion that the same genus, family or order of mammals ever arose\r\nindependently from radically different ancestors. We have no reason to\r\nbelieve that identical groups of mammals were ever separately developed\r\nin land areas which through long periods of time had no means of\r\nintercommunication. If such a thing ever happened, it must have been the\r\nrarest of exceptions. On the other hand, parallelism, by which _related_\r\nforms pass through similar stages of development, would seem to have\r\nbeen so exceedingly common, as fairly to deserve being called a normal\r\nmethod of evolution. As more and better material has been gathered, it\r\nhas grown increasingly clear that almost every large group of generic,\r\nfamily or higher rank, whose history is known in any adequate measure,\r\nconsists of several distinct, though related phyla, which pursued more or\r\nless closely parallel courses of modification, though diverging from one\r\nanother sufficiently to make the distinction of them comparatively easy.\r\nThe parallelism was thus not exact, however perfect it may have been\r\nin particular structures, and the longer the phyla persisted, the more\r\ndistinctly did they diverge.\r\n\r\nA typical problem, which involves these principles, is afforded by the\r\nvery curious and interesting group of South American hoofed animals\r\nknown as the †Litopterna (Chap. XIII). The many remarkable resemblances\r\nbetween these ungulates and the perissodactyls and, more specifically,\r\nbetween the family †Proterotheriidæ and the horses, have been very\r\ndifferently interpreted by palæontologists. Some have insisted that the\r\n†Litopterna should be merged in the Perissodactyla, on the ground that\r\nsuch a degree of likeness could not have been independently acquired.\r\nOthers hold that this is a remarkable case of parallelism or convergence,\r\nand the latter is, in my opinion, much the more probable view. Until\r\nthe ancestry of both groups, Perissodactyla and †Litopterna, shall have\r\nbeen definitely ascertained, it will not be practicable to make a final\r\ndecision between these alternatives, nor, if the similarities were really\r\nindependently acquired, to determine whether parallel or convergent\r\nevolution is involved. It is quite possible that both groups were rooted\r\nin the common ground of the †Condylarthra, and, if so, their relation\r\nis one of parallelism; but no such common ancestry has been proved, and\r\nit is equally possible that their ancestry was totally distinct. In the\r\nlatter case the resemblances were due to convergence.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the remarkable resemblances between the †Proterotheriidæ\r\nand the horses were separately acquired, it should be emphasized that\r\nthese similarities nowhere amount to identity. The likenesses are not\r\nconfined to a few structures, but are general throughout the skeleton and\r\nmay be noted in the teeth, skull, trunk, limbs and feet, but in every\r\nsingle one of these parts the similarities are offset by differences of\r\ngreat significance. No competent anatomist would mistake any of the bones\r\nof the †proterotheres for the corresponding parts of the horses, whatever\r\nview he might hold as to the relationship between the two groups. The\r\ncase is thus one of a very instructive kind, as tending to show that\r\nidentity of structure in so highly complex creatures as mammals is not\r\nindependently attained by widely separated or entirely unrelated forms.\r\nProbable as this conclusion is made by all the available evidence, it\r\ncannot be regarded as demonstrated; it is proverbially impossible to\r\nprove a negative.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is equally probable that nearly related forms do\r\nvery frequently, perhaps normally, pass through separate, but closely\r\nsimilar, courses of development. It is likely that a new species is\r\nusually formed through similar and simultaneous modification of many\r\nindividuals, rather than from a single individual or pair. It may be the\r\ngeneral rule, as almost certainly has often happened, that a new genus\r\narises by the separate assumption of the new character by several species\r\nof the ancestral genus, rather than through the rapid diversification of\r\na single species, though, no doubt, parallel and divergent modification\r\nare both very frequent and important processes. Dr. Eigenmann concludes\r\nfrom his study of South American fresh-water fishes that a certain\r\nnew genus is even now in process of origin through the transformation\r\nof several species of an older genus, which in different parts of the\r\ncontinent are simultaneously, but independently, taking on the new\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is possible to assign a definite reason for the independent\r\norigin of similar structures in different groups of mammals. Except\r\nfor the head, there is much similarity of appearance among the very\r\nmassive hoofed animals, such as the elephants, rhinoceroses, tapirs\r\nand hippopotamuses of the present time, a fact which induced Cuvier\r\nto unite them in one order, the “Pachydermata,” a term which has\r\npassed into vernacular, if metaphorical, usage. No doubt also, several\r\nextinct groups, such as the †Amblypoda and the perissodactyl family\r\nof the †Titanotheriidæ, would have been included, had they been\r\nknown in Cuvier’s day. In the largest and heaviest of these animals,\r\nthe elephants, †amblypods and †titanotheres, there are many close\r\ncorrespondences in all parts of the skeleton, which are clearly due to\r\nthe mechanical necessities imposed by the support of immense weight,\r\nand the developmental history of each group shows that the smaller and\r\nlighter ancestors were less similar than the larger and more massive\r\ndescendants. Such subsequently acquired likenesses are thus obvious\r\nexamples of convergence and were caused by adaptation to similar needs.\r\n\r\nFürbringer has shown that among birds size and weight of body determine\r\nmany resemblances between unrelated families, the largest forms\r\ndisplaying a more advanced grade of specialization.\r\n\r\nIt is thus extremely probable that evolution is a highly complex process,\r\nin which divergent, parallel and convergent modes of development are\r\nnormally concerned. This complexity greatly increases the difficulty of\r\ndetermining phylogenies, which would be very much easier could every\r\nnotable resemblance be at once accepted as proof of relationship. It\r\noften renders impossible the classification of some isolated group,\r\nwhich seems to have several incompatible affinities. It emphasizes the\r\nnecessity of founding schemes of classification upon the totality of\r\nstructure and the importance of determining the value of characters,\r\nwhether they are primitive or advanced, divergent, parallel or\r\nconvergent, before attempting to use them in classification.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the field of mammalian evolution, so far as that is\r\nrecorded by the fossils, the general impression received is that the\r\nmost important process is divergent development, one line branching out\r\ninto several. This process became especially vigorous and rapid at times\r\nof important change in the character of the environment, what Osborn\r\nhas called “adaptive radiation.” As we have repeatedly observed in the\r\nhistory of particular groups, _e.g._ the rhinoceroses, horses and camels,\r\nnumerous parallel phyla of the same family existed together in certain\r\ngeological stages, but as these phyla were traced back in time, they were\r\nfound to draw together and display themselves as branches of a single\r\nstem. This favours the inference that the mammalian orders, so far as\r\nthey are truly natural groups and not arbitrary assemblages, are each\r\nof single, or monophyletic, origin, and that the parallel and convergent\r\nmodes of development, while very frequent and important, are subordinate\r\nto divergence.\r\n\r\nII. A second problem is whether development among mammals is always\r\nby means of reduction in the number of parts, or whether that number\r\nmay not be increased. With this is involved the so-called law of the\r\n“irreversibility of evolution,” according to which organs once lost, or\r\nreduced to a vestigial condition, are never regained, or reëstablished\r\nin function. There can be no question that the usual mode of mammalian\r\ndevelopment is by reduction in the number of parts and the enlargement\r\nand elaboration of those which are retained, as, for example, in the\r\nreduction of five toes to one in the series of the horses; but there are\r\ncases which require a different explanation. The very numerous teeth of\r\nthe porpoises and dolphins and of the Giant Armadillo are not a primitive\r\nfeature, but must have arisen by a process of multiplication. In the\r\nvery curious Large-eared Wolf (_Otocyon_) of South Africa the number\r\nof molar teeth 3/4 exceeds that found in any other placental mammal.\r\nThis feature has been interpreted as a proof of marsupial relationship,\r\nbut, as the creature is a typical dog in all other respects, such a\r\nrelationship would involve a degree of convergence in development that\r\nis quite inadmissible without the most cogent evidence. Until something\r\nis learned regarding the descent of _Otocyon_, no positive statement can\r\nbe made as to the significance of its exceptional dentition, but much\r\nthe most likely supposition is that additional teeth have been developed\r\nin an otherwise normal canid. However that may be, the testimony of the\r\nfossils is unequivocally to the effect that the usual mode of development\r\namong mammals is by a reduction in the number of parts, accompanied by\r\nenlargement and specialization in those which are retained.\r\n\r\nIt is equally clear that the “law of irreversibility” holds good in\r\na very large number of cases, but whether it is always valid is very\r\ndoubtful. In the Guinea Pig, as in all its family (Caviidæ), there are\r\nfour toes in the front foot, three in the hind; but Professor Castle has\r\nlately succeeded in producing a race with four toes in the hind foot. To\r\ncall this a “monstrosity” or “abnormality” explains nothing; the fact\r\nremains that the four-toed race has been established and no reason can be\r\nassigned why the same thing might not happen in nature. If Dr. Matthew’s\r\nview concerning the origin of the American deer from _†Leptomeryx_ (p.\r\n409), should prove to be well founded, another example of the same\r\nkind would be furnished. In _†Leptomeryx_ of the Oligocene the upper\r\ncanine was reduced to minute, almost vestigial proportions, while in the\r\nancestral deer, _†Blastomeryx_ of the lower Miocene, it was a large,\r\nscimitar-like tusk. While I am unable to accept this derivation of the\r\ndeer, it may be true nevertheless and, if so, will be a most interesting\r\nexample of the rehabilitation of a vestigial organ. Decision must await\r\nthe discovery of the intermediate forms. Many such cases and instances\r\nof the addition of parts may be so far undetected, but the phylogenetic\r\nseries, as we have them before us, point decidedly to the conclusion that\r\nsuch rehabilitation or new addition is exceptional.\r\n\r\nIII. So far as we are able to follow it by the aid of the fossils,\r\ndevelopment among the mammals would appear to be a remarkably direct\r\nand unswerving process. When any long-lived phylum, made up of numerous\r\nwell-preserved members, is studied, the observer cannot fail to be\r\nimpressed by the straightforward course of the evolutionary process,\r\nas though the animals were consciously making for a predetermined\r\ngoal, which, needless to say, they were not. A minute cusp makes its\r\nappearance on a tooth, enlarges steadily in each succeeding genus, and\r\nultimately becomes a very important element in the pattern; and in this\r\nseries of changes there is no oscillation backward and forward. In the\r\nperissodactyls and a few other groups, the premolars in each family\r\ngradually and steadily assumed the size and complexity of molars;\r\nbeginning at the hinder end of the series, these teeth one by one become\r\nmolariform, not in irregular and haphazard fashion, but by perfectly\r\ngraded stages. The same gradual and direct process was maintained in the\r\noft-recurring reduction of digits among the hoofed animals, differing\r\nfor each group according to the symmetry of the foot. In the horses, for\r\nexample, the first digit became vestigial and disappeared, and then the\r\nfifth followed, leaving a three-toed foot, in which the median digit\r\nwas notably the largest and bore most of the weight. Throughout the\r\nOligocene and Miocene epochs the horses were all tridactyl, but there was\r\na gradual enlargement of the median digit and dwindling of the laterals,\r\nuntil these became mere dew-claws, not touching the ground, and the\r\nweight was carried entirely upon the median one. Finally, the laterals\r\nlost their phalanges and were farther reduced to splints, which is the\r\nmodern condition. In the same gradual and unswerving manner the higher\r\nartiodactyls went through a process of digital reduction from five to\r\ntwo, and numberless other instances of similar sort might be adduced.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the direction of change long followed may be departed\r\nfrom, the deviation being due to the introduction of a new factor. In\r\nthe earliest deer the males were hornless, but they developed effective\r\nweapons of defence by the enlargement of the upper canine teeth into\r\nlong and sharp, sabre-like tusks. When antlers appeared, the work of\r\ndefence was transferred to them, and the tusks began to dwindle, being\r\neventually suppressed in those deer which had large and complex antlers,\r\nthough persisting to the present time in the hornless Musk Deer and in\r\nthe small-antlered Muntjaks, which can defend themselves with their sharp\r\ntusks.\r\n\r\nIt would be inaccurate to say that fluctuations in the size and\r\neffectiveness of parts never occurred; on the contrary, there is evidence\r\nthat such fluctuations in details were not infrequent, and may have been\r\neven more common than we suppose. To give one instance, the very early\r\ncamels of the upper Eocene and lower Oligocene had small canines, which\r\nthough not at all functionless or vestigial, were yet little larger than\r\nincisors. Though the ancestral camels of the middle and lower Eocene are\r\nnot yet definitely known, there is strong reason to believe that in them,\r\nas in all of their contemporaries among the ungulates, the canines were\r\nenlarged and fang-like. If so, the canine teeth in the camels underwent\r\ndecided fluctuations in size, being first larger, then smaller and again\r\nenlarging. If Dr. Matthew’s interesting theory as to the origin of\r\nthe true felines from primitive †sabre-tooth cats (see p. 540) should\r\nbe confirmed, it would furnish a very striking example of fluctuating\r\ndevelopment. The acceptance of the theory involves the admission of the\r\nfollowing changes: (1) The upper canine was enlarged and changed into\r\na thin, recurved, scimitar-like tusk; (2) the lower canine was much\r\nreduced, becoming little larger than the incisors; (3) the lower jaw\r\ndeveloped a flange on each side from its inferior border, against which\r\nthe inner side of the upper canine rested, when the mouth was closed, and\r\nthe chin was nearly flat, meeting the outer surface of the jaw at a right\r\nangle. After these peculiarities had been fully established, the stock\r\ndivided into two series; in one, the †machairodonts, the specialization\r\ncontinued along the same lines, assuming more and more exaggerated forms,\r\nwhile in the true cats it was reversed. The upper canine grew shorter and\r\nthicker, the lower canine was very greatly enlarged, the lower jaw lost\r\nits flange, and its external and anterior surfaces no longer met at a\r\nright angle, but curved gradually into each other. As previously stated,\r\nsuch a reversal strikes me as improbable and not to be accepted without\r\nvery much more complete evidence than we now have, but it is perfectly\r\npossible that such evidence may be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nMaking the fullest allowance for all such cases of fluctuation, it\r\nremains true that in the great majority of the phyla whose history may\r\nbe followed in some detail, development has been remarkably direct and\r\nunswerving. Plasticity of organization and capacity for differentiation\r\nof structure in widely different directions would seem to be limited in\r\nthe mammals, especially among the more advanced groups.\r\n\r\nIV. A question that has been much debated and is still a centre of\r\ncontroversy deals with continuity and discontinuity in development. In\r\nother words, does evolution proceed by the cumulative effects of minutely\r\ngraded modifications, or is it a succession of leaps and sudden changes?\r\nThe difference is illustrated by many breeds and races of animals and\r\nplants under domestication, the history of which is known. Some have\r\narisen from “sports,” sudden and marked deviations from the parent stock,\r\nwhich “breed true” from the beginning. Of this character was the Ancon\r\nbreed of sheep, which was derived from a single short-legged ram that\r\nwas born of normal parents in 1791 and transmitted his peculiarities\r\nto his offspring. Professor Castle’s race of four-toed Guinea Pig\r\noriginated from one four-toed individual, which suddenly appeared in a\r\nlitter of normal ones. Other breeds have been formed by the careful and\r\nlong-continued selection of minute individual variations. Which of these\r\nmethods is the one that has been followed under natural conditions? or\r\nhas now one method been used and now another, according to circumstances?\r\nThe problem is one that has a profound and far-reaching importance for\r\nthe whole of evolutionary philosophy, which largely hinges upon it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, palæontology is not well fitted to give a decisive answer\r\nto these questions, for, however complete the record of any given series\r\nmay be, we never can be sure that it actually is so, and interruptions\r\nin the continuity of development might be due either to progress by\r\nabrupt changes, or to a failure to preserve all the gradations. For\r\nthat reason different observers have put divergent interpretations upon\r\nthe facts as we have them. The general impression that is made by the\r\nstudy of a well-preserved mammalian phylum is that of continuity, but a\r\ncloser analysis reveals numerous small breaks, and suggests, so far as\r\nthe record may be trusted, that the advance was made by separate steps,\r\nthough very short ones. Indeed, it has been objected that so completely\r\nrecorded a phylum as that of the horses must be illusory, because there\r\nis not perfect continuity between the successive genera, it being taken\r\nfor granted that such continuity is the normal mode of development.\r\n\r\nDr. Schlosser, on the other hand, is a disbeliever in perfect continuity.\r\n“I am of the opinion that we must reckon with development _per saltum_\r\nmore frequently than is usually done. We have been decidedly spoiled\r\nby the phylogenetic series of quiet successive development, such as\r\nwe meet with in the Oligocene and Miocene of North America in the\r\ntitanotheres, oreodonts, camels, etc., and in the upper Eocene of\r\nEurope in _Palæotherium_, _Paloplotherium_, etc., as well as from the\r\nOligocene into the Pleistocene, _e.g._, in the rhinoceroses, cervids,\r\nsuillines, amphicyonids. Even here we often make for ourselves artificial\r\ndifficulties by balancing, with an exaggerated scrupulousness, the\r\nindividual forms one against another, to see whether they really are\r\nexactly fitted to fill up any gaps. It is not the lack of suitable\r\nintermediate forms which so often renders difficult the establishment of\r\ngenetic series, but, quite on the contrary, the abundance of the forms\r\nat our disposal, among which we must make a choice. If, however, the\r\ndevelopment of phyla did not take place in the same region and under\r\nconstant climatic and topographical conditions, we must necessarily\r\nfind apparent gaps, for adaptation to a new environment occasions rapid\r\nchanges of organization, so that the immediate descendant will often\r\ndeviate considerably from its ancestor. But that must not mislead us into\r\ndenying the connection between such forms.”[22]\r\n\r\nBetter adapted to a solution of this problem than mammals are the fossil\r\nshells of Mollusca, the development of which may often be traced through\r\na thick series of strata, each step of modification being represented\r\nby innumerable individuals. In very many instances it appears that each\r\nspecies in a series of successive modifications had many contemporary\r\nfluctuating variations, but the change from one species to the next\r\nsucceeding one was by a small though abrupt mutation. The difference\r\nbetween two successive species may be no greater than that between two\r\ncontemporary variants of the same species, but it was a constant and not\r\na fluctuating difference. There is much reason to believe that such is\r\nat least a frequent mode of development, namely, that from species to\r\nspecies and genus to genus the transition has been by slight and sudden\r\nchanges. The possibility that such abrupt changes, however slight, are\r\nillusory and due to small gaps in the record, must be admitted, and\r\nthough this does not seem to be a very likely explanation, it is given\r\nplausibility by the almost perfect continuity between successive species\r\nwhich may sometimes be observed.\r\n\r\nThe extremely important and significant distinction between contemporary,\r\nfluctuating variations and successive, constant mutations was first drawn\r\nby Waagen, who says of them: “One must therefore distinguish strictly\r\nbetween varieties in space and those in time. To describe the former,\r\nthe long-used name ‘variety’ will suffice, for the latter, on the other\r\nhand, I would propose, for the sake of brevity, a new term, ‘mutation.’ A\r\nspecies as such, with reference to its connection with earlier or later\r\nforms, may be conceived and regarded as a mutation. But also in regard to\r\nthe value of these two concepts, just established (variety and mutation),\r\nan entirely different value is displayed on closer consideration. While\r\nthe former appears extremely vacillating, of small systematic value, the\r\nlatter, even though in minute characteristics, is extremely constant and\r\nalways to be recognized with certainty.”[23]\r\n\r\nThe same conception was adopted and elaborated by Neumayr: “Still other\r\ncharacteristics appear, which mark mutations as something different from\r\nvarieties, especially that, as a rule, there is a definite direction of\r\nmutation in each series, the same characters changing in the same sense\r\nthrough a considerable succession of strata.”[24]\r\n\r\nWhether development was continuous or discontinuous, there is no reason\r\nto suppose that the amount and rate of modification were always constant.\r\nOn the contrary, there is strong evidence that at times of great climatic\r\nor geographical changes, or when a region was invaded by a horde of\r\nimmigrants, widespread readjustments were accomplished with comparative\r\nrapidity. Indeed, such periods of relatively quick changes have long\r\nseemed to be implied by the facts of the palæontological records.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is only too clear that the principles as to the modes of mammalian\r\ndevelopment which can be deduced from the history of the various groups\r\nmust, for the most part, be stated in a cautious and tentative manner,\r\nso as not to give an undue appearance of certainty to preliminary\r\nconclusions, which should be held as subject to revision with the advance\r\nof knowledge. Much has, however, been already learned, and there is every\r\nreason to hope that Experimental Zoölogy and Palæontology, by combining\r\ntheir resources, will eventually shed full light upon a subject of such\r\nexceptional difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Memoirs of the University of California, Vol. I, pp. 209-211.\r\n\r\n[2] Voyage of a Naturalist, Amer. ed., pp. 133-134.\r\n\r\n[3] J.

To the future specialist such a preliminary\r\nsurvey of the whole field will afford the necessary orientation. To the\r\nnon-specialist the graphic presentation of the outlines of the subject\r\ncannot fail to prove both interesting and informing. The book aims\r\nto cultivate a proper scientific attitude by training the student to\r\ncarefully distinguish between fact and inference and between observation\r\nand hypothesis. He is taught to weigh his evidences carefully, and while\r\nbalancing probabilities suspend judgment where the data for decision are\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\nThe new edition incorporates the results of all the important advances\r\nmade in geological knowledge in recent years. The number of illustrations\r\nhas been greatly increased, thus adding to the admirable clearness of the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuide to the Study of Animal Ecology\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES C.

An ecological point of view is described more fully than\r\nother subjects, so that the student may see the need of familiarity with\r\nthose tests or criteria by means of which he may be able to determine\r\nfor himself ecological relations and the validity of ecological studies.\r\nThe other phases are treated less fully in the discussions and with more\r\ndetail bibliographically, so that this may be a useful source-book.\r\nIn fact, the very extensive and up-to-date bibliography is one of the\r\nimportant features of the entire book.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Age of Mammals in Europe, Asia, and North America\r\n\r\nBY HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN\r\n\r\nA.B., SC.D.

No\r\nzoölogist interested in mammals, birds, fishes, or reptiles can fail\r\nto find it of value. The geologist finds here the clearest exposition\r\nthat has been given of the succession of geological events in the\r\nmammal-bearing continental formations of the Tertiary and Quaternary of\r\nthe Western States. The anthropologist finds in the closing chapter on\r\nthe Pleistocene a key to most of the problems which confront him as to\r\nthe time of man’s first appearance. The botanist may refer to it for the\r\nsuccession and evolution of flora.\r\n\r\nTo the general reader it offers the first connected account of the\r\nhistory of life on the earth during the later geological epochs, a record\r\nembodying the very latest results of the active research going on in\r\nthis direction at the present time. In so far as science has succeeded\r\nin piecing together the fragmentary evidence of the rocks, this volume\r\ncontains glimpses into the remote past of the continental outlines, the\r\nclimate, vegetation, and animal life of the epochs preceding the “Age\r\nof Man.” The text is supplemented by a very original and suggestive\r\nseries of illustrations, notable among which are numerous half-tone\r\nreproductions from the famous restorations of extinct mammals by Charles\r\nR. Knight, many of which are published here for the first time. Moreover,\r\nthere is appended to the volume an invaluable Classification of the\r\nMammalia, which gives not only the systematic position but also the\r\ngeologic and geographic distribution and the popular names of all the\r\nimportant genera of mammals, both living and fossil.\r\n\r\n                      Comments on The Age of Mammals\r\n\r\n“Students of palæontology have awaited impatiently the past few years\r\na promised work on extinct mammals by Professor Osborn. In his ‘Age of\r\nMammals,’ expectations have been more than realized.”—S. W. WILLISTON, in\r\n_Science_, Feb. 17, 1911.\r\n\r\n“Dr. H. F. Osborn is a great palæontologist; in this book he has gathered\r\ntogether the work of a life-time, and that work, besides being original\r\nand constructive, is also critical and selective. The result is a great\r\nbook.” “While it is an incomparable text-book, a work of reference to the\r\nstudent, and, no doubt a fruitful field for the controversialist of the\r\nfuture, it is a work which can be read with interest and satisfaction by\r\nthe ‘genial omnivore,’ as Huxley called him, the general reader.”—_The\r\nField_, Jan. 7, 1911.\r\n\r\n“It is in the best sense a source book, for it gives at first hand, from\r\nthe original material, the ideas of an acknowledged master in mammalian\r\npalæontology.” “It has the clarity and directness of style so welcome,\r\nand rare, in such a book.”—E. C. CASE, in _Bulletin American Geographical\r\nSociety_, July, 1911.\r\n\r\n“A book of the utmost value to the student and teacher of mammalian life\r\nand likewise to the serious reader.”—_American Journal of Science_, Feb.,\r\n1911.\r\n\r\n“M. Osborn ... devait s’attacher a nous présenter le tableau aussi\r\ncomplet et aussi fidèle que possible des faunes de Mammifères fossiles\r\nqui se sont succédé dans l’hémisphère Nord pendant l’ère tertiaire. Et\r\nj’ai plaisir à dire tout de suite qu’il y a parfaitement réussi.”—M.\r\nBOULE, in _Mouvement Scientifique_, 1911, p. 569.\r\n\r\n“Professor Osborn has produced a book which will appeal to the learned\r\nspecialist and to the thoughtful general reader as well.” “The\r\nwork is well adapted to school and college use, and is abundantly\r\nillustrated.”—_Education_, Boston, Jan., 1911.\r\n\r\n“One of the most notable books on evolution since the appearance of\r\nDarwin’s ‘Origin of Species.’”—_Forest and Stream_, Dec. 10, 1910.\r\n\r\n“Nejlepší současný palæontolog americký, Henry Fairfield Osborn, vydal\r\nnedàvno s titulem tuto citovaným znamenitě psanou a pěkně vypravenou\r\nknihu o ‘věku ssavců.’”—F. Bayer in _Věstníku Ceské Akademie císaře\r\nFrantiška Josefa pro vědy, slovenost a umení_.—Ročník XX, 1911.\r\n\r\n“Written with clearness and vivacity, most admirably illustrated,\r\nespecially by the ‘restorations’ of Mr. Knight, and illuminated by maps,\r\nProfessor Osborn builds, page after page, his story-mosaic.... The reader\r\nwill soon discover that he is a brilliant generalizer, possessed of\r\nmaterial gathered from all around the globe, fructifying his knowledge\r\nby the exercise of a constructive imagination, and expressing his facts\r\nand ideas in a literary style, clear, vigorous, and entertaining.”—_The\r\nLiterary Digest_, Feb. 4, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge Natural History\r\n\r\nEDITED BY\r\n\r\nS.

He has lived with\r\nthe Eskimo for long periods; he knows their language; he has subsisted\r\non their food; he has heard their legends; he has seen them in their\r\ndaily lives as have few explorers. Consequently his remarks about this\r\nprimitive and matter-of-fact people are shrewd, true, and frequently\r\namusing.
