If the book seems to be\r\nsomewhat small for its object, it will, it is hoped, be found that this\r\nis due to care in the arrangement and wording.\r\n\r\nSources of information have been acknowledged in the text, but special\r\nmention may be made of lectures given by Professor Unwin at Coopers\r\nHill College, of Harcourt’s large work on _Rivers and Canals_, of the\r\npapers[1] by Binnie on rainfall, by Shaw on the closing of the river\r\nTista, by Harcourt on movable weirs and on estuaries, by Strange on\r\nreservoirs, and by Ottley and Brightmore, Gore and Wilson, and Hill\r\non the stresses in masonry dams; of the articles by Bligh[2] on weirs\r\nwith porous foundations and by Deacon[3] on reservoir capacity, of\r\nthe Indian Government paper by Spring on “River Control on the Guide\r\nBank System,” and of the Punjab Government paper containing Kennedy’s\r\nremarks on silting and scour in the Sirhind Canal. The two papers last\r\nmentioned are not easily accessible, and they contain matter of great\r\ninterest. The important points, often obscured by masses of detail or\r\nfigures, have been extracted.[4]\r\n\r\nSilting and scour (CHAP. IV.) had already been dealt with in\r\n_Hydraulics_,[5] but some further information has since come to light\r\nand the subject has been treated afresh and the matter re-written.\r\n\r\n  E. S. B.\r\n\r\nCHELTENHAM, _1st May 1913_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVER AND CANAL ENGINEERING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.=--River and Canal Engineering is that branch\r\nof engineering science which deals with the characteristics of streams\r\nflowing in open channels, and with the principles and methods which\r\nshould be followed in dealing with, altering, and controlling them.\r\nIt is not necessary to make a general distinction between natural and\r\nartificial streams; some irrigation canals or other artificial channels\r\nare as large as rivers and have many of the same characteristics. Any\r\nspecial remarks applicable to either class will be given as occasion\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Résumé of the Subject.=--CHAP. II. of this book deals with the\r\ncollection of information concerning streams, a procedure which is\r\nnecessary before any considerable work in connection with a stream can\r\nbe undertaken, and often before it can even be decided whether or not\r\nit is to be undertaken. CHAP. III. deals with rainfall, and describes\r\nhow rainfall figures and statistics can be utilised by the engineer in\r\ndealing with streams.\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV. explains the laws of silting and scouring action, a subject\r\nof great importance and one to which the attention ordinarily given\r\nis insufficient. The general characteristics of streams, being due\r\nentirely to silting or scouring tendencies, are included in this\r\nchapter. CHAP. V. describes how silting or scouring may be, under some\r\ncircumstances, artificially induced or retarded.\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI. deals with various methods of protecting banks against\r\nerosion or damage. CHAP. VII. treats of diversions or the opening\r\nout of new channels, and with the opposite of this, viz. the closing\r\nof channels, a feat which, when the stream is flowing, is sometimes\r\nvery difficult to achieve. This chapter also deals with dredging and\r\nexcavation.\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII. discusses the subject of the training of streams, a class\r\nof work which is generally undertaken in order to make them navigable\r\nor to improve their existing capacities for navigation, but may be\r\nundertaken for other reasons. The main features of this kind of work\r\nare the narrowing and deepening of the stream, often the reduction of\r\nthe velocity and slope, and generally the raising of the water-level.\r\nIn this kind of work a channel may be completely remodelled and even\r\nnew reaches constructed. CHAP. IX. deals with artificial channels of\r\nearth or masonry, and includes navigation canals.[6]\r\n\r\nIn CHAPS. X. and XI. the chief masonry works or isolated structures--as\r\ndistinguished from general works which extend over considerable\r\nlengths of channel--are dealt with, and those principles of design\r\ndiscussed which affect the works in their hydraulic capacities. General\r\nprinciples of design applicable to all kinds of works, such as the\r\nthicknesses of arches or retaining walls, are not considered; they can\r\nbe found in books on general engineering design.\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII. treats of storm waters and river floods, and shows how works\r\ncan be designed for getting rid of flood water and how floods can be\r\nmitigated or prevented, one of the chief measures, the widening of the\r\nchannel and the lowering of the water-level, being the opposite of that\r\nadopted for training works. Embankments for stopping flooding are also\r\ndealt with. CHAP. XIII. deals with reservoirs, including the design of\r\nearthen and masonry dams.\r\n\r\nCHAPS. XIV. and XV. deal with tidal waters, river mouths and estuaries,\r\nand works in connection with them, viz. the training of estuaries and\r\nthe methods of dealing with bars, the object being in all cases the\r\nimprovement of the navigable capacities of the channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Design and Execution of Works.=--After obtaining full information\r\nconcerning the stream to be dealt with, careful calculations are,\r\nin the case of any large and important work, made as to the effects\r\nwhich will be produced by it. These effects cannot always be exactly\r\nforeseen. Sometimes matters can be arranged so that the work can be\r\nstopped short at some stage without destroying the utility of the\r\nportion done, or so that the completed work can be altered to some\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nIn works for controlling streams there is, as will appear in due\r\ncourse, a considerable choice of types of work and methods of\r\nconstruction. In practice it will generally be found that there are,\r\nin any particular locality, reasons for giving preference to one\r\nparticular type or kind of work or, at all events, that the choice is\r\nlimited to a few of them, either because certain kinds of materials\r\nand appliances can be obtained more cheaply and readily than others,\r\nor because works of a particular type have already been successfully\r\nadopted there, or because the people of the district are accustomed to\r\ncertain classes of work or methods of construction. In out-of-the-way\r\nplaces it is often undesirable to avoid any type of work which cannot\r\nbe quickly repaired or readily kept in order by such means as exist\r\nnear the spot.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that perishable materials, such as trees,\r\nstakes, and brushwood, cannot produce permanent results. They can\r\nproduce results which will last for a long time and which may even be\r\npermanent. By the time the materials have decayed, the changes wrought\r\nmay have been very great, deposits of shingle or silt may have occurred\r\nand become covered with vegetation, and there may be little tendency\r\nfor matters to revert to their former condition. If the expense of\r\nusing more lasting materials had had to be incurred, the works might\r\nnever have been carried out at all. On the Mississippi enormous\r\nquantities of work have been done with fascines.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =The Hydraulics of Open Streams.=--When any reach of a stream\r\nis altered, say by widening, narrowing, or deepening, so that the\r\nwater-level is changed, there will also be a change in the water-level,\r\na gradually diminishing change, for some distance upstream of the\r\nreach. Also in the lowest portion of the reach the change will\r\ngradually diminish and it will vanish at the extreme downstream end\r\nof the reach. In the next lowest reach there is no change. Thus if it\r\nis desired that the change in the water-level shall take full effect\r\nthroughout the whole of a reach, the change in the channel must be\r\ncarried further down. If a weir is built there is no change in the\r\nwater-level downstream of it except such as may be due to loss of\r\nwater in the reach upstream of it. The above points are mentioned here\r\nbecause, although they are really questions of hydraulics, they are of\r\nmuch importance and of very general application.\r\n\r\nMatters connected with the hydraulics of open streams seem to lend\r\nthemselves in a peculiar way to loosely expressed remarks and\r\nfallacious opinions. The set of a stream towards a bank is sometimes\r\nsupposed to profoundly affect the discharge of a diversion or branch.\r\nIts effect is simply that of “velocity of approach,” which, as is\r\nwell known, is quite small with ordinary velocities, and is merely\r\nequivalent to a very small increase of head. Narrow bridges or other\r\nworks are sometimes said to seriously “obstruct” a stream without any\r\nobservations being made of the fall in the water surface through the\r\nbridge. This fall is the only measure of the real obstruction.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRAINFALL\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Rainfall Statistics.=--The mean annual rainfall varies very greatly\r\naccording to the locality. In England it varies from about 20 inches\r\nat Hunstanton in Cambridgeshire, to about 200 inches at Seathwaite in\r\nCumberland; in India, from 2 or 3 inches in parts of Scinde, to 450\r\ninches or more at Cherrapunji in the Eastern Himalayas.\r\n\r\nRain is brought by winds which blow across the sea. Hence the rainfall\r\nin any country is generally greatest in those localities where the\r\nprevailing winds blow from seaward, provided they have travelled a\r\ngreat distance over the sea. Rainfall is greater among hills than\r\nelsewhere, because the temperature at great elevations is lower.\r\nCurrents of moist air striking the hills are deflected upwards, become\r\ncooled, and the water vapour becomes rain. This process, if the hills\r\nare not lofty, may not produce its full effect till the air currents\r\nhave passed over the hills, and thus the rainfall on the leeward slopes\r\nmay be greater than elsewhere, but on the inner and more lofty ranges\r\nthe rainfall is generally greatest on the windward side.\r\n\r\nThus the rainfall may vary greatly at places not far apart. An extreme\r\ninstance of this occurs in the Bombay hills, where the mean annual\r\nfalls at two stations only ten miles apart are respectively 300 inches\r\nand 50 inches.\r\n\r\nIn temperate climates the rainfall is generally distributed over all\r\nthe months of the year; in the tropics the great bulk of the rain often\r\nfalls in a few months.\r\n\r\nThe fall at any one place varies greatly from year to year. To obtain\r\nreally reliable figures concerning any place, observations at that\r\nplace should extend over a period of thirty to thirty-five years. The\r\nfigures of the mean annual fall will then probably be correct to within\r\n2 per cent. The degree of accuracy to be expected in results deduced\r\nfrom observations extending over shorter periods is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  No. of years       25    20    15    10     5\r\n  Error per cent.     3    3¼     5     8    15\r\n\r\nThese figures were deduced by Binnie (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol.\r\ncix.) from an examination of rainfall figures obtained over long\r\nperiods of time at many places scattered over the world. The errors\r\nmay, of course, be plus or minus. They are the averages of the errors\r\nactually found, and are themselves subject to fluctuations. Thus the 15\r\nper cent. error for a five-year period may be 16 or 13, the 8 per cent.\r\nerror for a ten-year period may be 8½ or 7½, with similar but minute\r\nfluctations for the other periods.\r\n\r\nBinnie’s figures also show that the ratio of the fall at any place in\r\nthe driest year to the mean annual fall, averages ·51 to ·68, with a\r\ngeneral average of ·60, and that the ratio in the wettest year to the\r\nmean annual fall averages 1·41 to 1·75, with a general average of 1·51.\r\nFor India the general averages are ·50 and 1·75. These figures are\r\nuseful as a means of estimating the probable greatest and least annual\r\nfall, but they are averages for groups of places. The greatest fall at\r\nany particular place may occasionally be twice the mean annual fall. At\r\nsome places in India, in Mauritius, and at Marseilles it has been two\r\nand a half times the mean annual fall. The least annual fall may, in\r\nIndia, be as low as ·27 of the mean. In England the fall in a dry year\r\nhas, once at least, been found to be only ·30 of the mean annual fall.\r\nThe mean fall (average for all places) in the three driest years is,\r\nfrom Binnie’s figures, about ·76 of the mean annual fall. The figures\r\ngiven above, except when a particular country is mentioned, apply to\r\nall countries and to places where the rainfall is heavy, as well as to\r\nthose where it is light. But in extremely dry places the fluctuations\r\nare likely to be much greater. At Kurrachee, with a mean annual fall of\r\nonly 7·5 inches, the fall in a very wet year has been found to be 3·73\r\ntimes, and in a very dry year only ·07 times the mean annual fall.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom the probable rainfall at any place in the\r\ndriest year may be taken as ·63 of the mean annual fall. For periods\r\nof two, three, four, five and six consecutive dry years, the figures\r\nare ·72, ·77, ·80, ·82, and ·835. These figures are of importance in\r\ncalculations for the capacity of reservoirs (CHAP. XIII., _Art. 2_).\r\n\r\nWhen accurate statistics of rainfall are required for any work, the\r\nrainfall of the tract concerned must be specially studied and local\r\nfigures obtained for as many years as possible. Very frequently it is\r\nnecessary to set up a rain-gauge, or several if the tract is extensive\r\nor consists of several areas at different elevations. Sometimes there\r\nis only a year or so in which to collect figures. In this case the\r\nratio of the observed fall to that, for the same period, at the nearest\r\nstation where regular records are kept, is calculated. This ratio is\r\nassumed to hold good throughout, and thus the probable rainfall figures\r\nfor the new station can be obtained for the whole period over which\r\nthe records have been kept at the regular station. The volumes of the\r\nBritish Rainfall Organisation contain a vast amount of information\r\nregarding rainfall. For a large area there should be one rain-gauge for\r\nevery 500 acres, for a small area more. In the case of a valley there\r\nshould be at least three gauges along the line of the deepest part--one\r\nat the highest point, one at the lowest, and one midway as regards\r\nheight--and two gauges half way up the sides and opposite the middle\r\ngauge (_Ency. Brit._, Tenth Edition, vol. xxxiii.). Some extra gauges\r\nmay be set up for short periods in order to see whether the regular\r\ngauges give fair indications of the rainfall of the tract. If they do\r\nnot do so some allowances can be made for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Available Rainfall.=--The area drained by a stream is called its\r\n“catchment area” or “basin.” The available rainfall in a catchment area\r\nis the total fall less the quantity which is evaporated or absorbed\r\nby vegetation. The evaporation does not chiefly take place directly\r\nfrom the surface. Rain sinks a short distance into the ground, and\r\nis subsequently evaporated. The available rainfall does not all flow\r\ndirectly into the streams. Some sinks deep into the ground and forms\r\nsprings, and these many months later augment the flow of the stream and\r\nmaintain it in dry seasons. The available rainfall of a given catchment\r\narea is known as the “yield” of that area.\r\n\r\nEstimation of the available rainfall is necessary chiefly in cases\r\nwhere water is to be stored in reservoirs for town supply or\r\nirrigation. The ratio of the available to the total rainfall depends\r\nchiefly on the nature and steepness of the surface of the catchment\r\narea, on the temperature and dryness of the air, and on the amount\r\nand distribution of the rainfall. The ratio is far greater when the\r\nfalls are heavy than when they are light. Again, when the ground is\r\nfairly dry and the temperature high--as in summer in England--nearly\r\nthe whole of the rainfall may evaporate; but when the ground is soaked\r\nand the temperature low--as in late autumn and winter in England--the\r\nbulk of the rainfall runs off. In the eighteen years from 1893 to 1900\r\nthe average discharge of the Thames at Teddington, after allowing for\r\nabstractions by water companies, was in July, August, and September 12\r\nper cent. of the rainfall--6·9 inches--in its basin, and in January,\r\nFebruary, and March 60 per cent. of the fall which was 5·9 inches. The\r\ntotal fall in the year was 26·4 inches. Some rivers in Spain discharge,\r\nin years of heavy rainfall, 39 per cent., and in years of light\r\nrainfall 9 per cent. of the rainfall (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol.\r\nclxvii.). The discharge of a river is not always greatest in the month,\r\nor even the year, of greatest rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe table opposite gives some figures obtained by comparison of\r\nrainfall figures and stream discharges. The case of the area of 2208\r\nacres near Cape Town is described in a paper by Bartlett (_Min. Proc.\r\nInst. C.E._, vol. clxxxviii.), and it is shown by figures that part\r\nof the rainfall in the rainy season went to increase the underground\r\nsupply which afterwards maintained the flow in the dry season.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+-------------+-----------------+---------+---------------+-----------------------+\r\n  |        Place.          |  Catchment  |Period over which| Total   |   Available   |      Remarks          |\r\n  |                        |    Area.    |  Observations   |Rainfall |   Rainfall.   |                       |\r\n  |                        |             |    Extended.    |Observed.|               |                       |\r\n  +------------------------+-------------+-----------------+---------+---------------+-----------------------+\r\n  |                        |   Acres.    |                 | Inches. |Ratio to Total.|                       |\r\n  |Nagpur, Central India   |    4,224    |June to September|   44    |      ·40      |                       |\r\n  |                        |             |(Monsoon period).|         |               |                       |\r\n  |   ”          ”         |      ”      |      ”          |   30    |      ·27      |                       |\r\n  |Mercara, South India    |       48    | Whole year.     |  119    |      ·37      |Gravelly soil overlying|\r\n  |King William’s Town,    |             |                 |         |               |  granite.             |\r\n  |  Cape Colony           |   67,200    |     ”           |   27    |      ·21      |Hills with forest and  |\r\n  |Near Cape Town, Cape    |             |                 |         |               |  bush.                |\r\n  |  Colony                |      110    |May to October   |   31·5  |      ·51      |Bare hills.            |\r\n  |Near Cape Town, Cape    |             |(rainy season).  |         |               |                       |\r\n  |  Colony                |    2,208    |     ”           |   43    |      ·40      |    ”                  |\r\n  |Melbury Moor, Devonshire|     ...     | Whole year.     |   50·7  |      ·54      |                       |\r\n  |Newport, Monmouthshire  |     ...     |     ”           |   40    |      ·40      |                       |\r\n  |Newport, Isle of Wight  |     ...     |     ”           |   32    |      ·40      |                       |\r\n  |Basin of Nepean River,  |  284 sq.    |                 |         |               |                       |\r\n  |  N.S.W.                |   miles     |     ”           |   44·3  |      ·44      |Bare, broken ground.   |\r\n  |Basin of Cataract River,|             |                 |         |               |                       |\r\n  |  N.S.W.                | 70 sq. miles|     ”           |   54    |      ·45      |     ”      ”          |\r\n  +------------------------+-------------+-----------------+---------+---------------+-----------------------+\r\n\r\nThe following statement shows how the available rainfall may vary from\r\nyear to year.

These figures are only\r\nrough. The figures for rocks and pastures are too high. The loss from\r\nevaporation and absorption is not proportional to the rainfall. It is\r\nfar more correct to consider the loss as a fairly constant quantity\r\nin any given locality but increasing somewhat when the rainfall is\r\ngreat. The available rainfall in Great Britain has generally been\r\noverestimated. Sometimes it has been taken as being ·60 of the whole\r\nfall. More commonly the loss is taken to be 13 to 15 inches. This is\r\ncorrect for the western mountain districts, where the rainfall is\r\nabout 80 inches and the soil consists chiefly of rocks partly covered\r\nwith moorland or pasture. In other parts of the country, especially\r\nwhere flat, the loss is often 17 to 20 inches. All the above figures\r\nare, however, general averages. The proper estimation of the available\r\nrainfall at any place in any country depends a great deal on experience\r\nand judgment, and on the extent to which figures for actual cases of\r\nsimilar character are available. Regarding the “run-off” from saturated\r\nland during short periods, see CHAP. XII., _Arts. 1_ and _2_.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Measurement of Rainfall.=--A rain-gauge should be in open ground\r\nand not sheltered by objects of any kind. The ordinary rain-gauge is\r\na short cylinder. This is often connected by a tapering piece to a\r\nlonger cylinder of smaller diameter. In this the rain is stored safely\r\nand is measured by a graduated rod. The measurement can be made more\r\naccurately than if the diameter was throughout the same as at the\r\ntop. In other cases the water is poured out of the cylinder into a\r\nmeasuring vessel. If the rain-gauge was sunk so that the top was level\r\nwith the ground, rain falling outside the gauge would splash into it\r\nand vitiate the readings unless the gauge was surrounded by a trench.\r\nOrdinarily the top of the gauge is from 1 to 3 feet above the ground.\r\nWhen it is 1 metre above the ground the rain registered is said to be\r\non the average about 6 per cent. less than it should be, owing to the\r\nfact that wind causes eddies and currents and carries away drops which\r\nshould have fallen into the gauge. The velocity of the wind increases\r\nwith the height above the ground, and so does the error of the\r\nrain-gauge. Devices for getting rid of the eddies have been invented by\r\nBoernstein and Nipher (_Ency. Brit._, Tenth Edition, vol. xviii.), but\r\nthey have not yet come into general use. The Boernstein device is being\r\nused experimentally at Eskdalemuir. It would appear that much splashing\r\ncannot take place when the ground is covered with grass, and that in\r\nsuch a case the top of the gauge could be 1 foot above the ground, thus\r\nmaking the error very small.\r\n\r\nIf the ground is at first level, then rises and then again becomes\r\nlevel, a rain-gauge at the foot of the slope will, with the prevailing\r\nwind blowing up the slope, register too much, and a rain-gauge just\r\nbeyond the top of the slope will register too little (_Ency. Brit._,\r\nTenth Edition, vol. xxxiii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Influence of Forests and Vegetation.=--When the ground is covered\r\nwith vegetation, and especially forests, the _humus_ or mould formed\r\nfrom leaves, etc., absorbs and retains moisture. It acts like a\r\nreservoir, so that the run-off takes place slowly and the denudation\r\nand erosion of the soil is checked. The roots of the trees or other\r\nvegetation also bind the soil together. Vegetation and forests thus\r\nmitigate the severity of floods and reduce the quantity of silt brought\r\ninto the streams. They also shield the ground from the direct rays of\r\nthe sun and so reduce evaporation, and thus, on the whole, augment the\r\navailable rainfall. Forests render the climate more equable and tend to\r\nreduce the temperature, and they thus, at least on hills, increase the\r\nactual rainfall to some extent.\r\n\r\nIf a forest is felled and replaced by cultivation, the ploughing of\r\nthe soil acts in the same way as the _humus_ of the forest, and the\r\ncrops replace the trees; and it has been stated that in the U.S.A.\r\nthe cultivation is as beneficial as the forests in mitigating floods\r\nand checking denudation of the soil (_Proc. Am. Soc. C.E._, vol.\r\nxxxiv.). But when forests are felled they are not, at least in hilly\r\ncountry, always replaced by cultivation. Measures to put a stop to the\r\ndestruction of forests or to afforest or reforest bare land may enter\r\ninto questions of the régime of streams or the supply of water. On the\r\nRhine, increase in the severity of floods was distinctly traced to\r\ndeforestation of the drainage area.\r\n\r\nIt is usually said that forests act as reservoirs by preventing snows\r\nfrom melting. This is disputed in the paper above quoted, and it is\r\nstated that in the absence of forests the snow forms drifts of enormous\r\ndepth, and these melt very gradually and act as reservoirs after the\r\nsnow in the forests has disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Heavy Falls in Short Periods.=--When rain water, instead of being\r\nstored or utilised, has to be got rid of, it is of primary importance\r\nto estimate roughly--exact estimates are impossible--the greatest\r\nprobable fall in a short time. This bears a rough ratio to the mean\r\nannual fall. The maximum observed falls in twenty-four hours range,\r\nin the United Kingdom, generally from ·05 to ·10 of the mean annual\r\nfall--but on one occasion the figure has been ·20,--and in the tropics\r\nfrom ·10 to ·25. Actual figures for particular places can be extracted\r\nfrom the rain registers, but the probability of their being exceeded\r\nmust be taken into account. The greatest fall observed in twenty-four\r\nhours in the United Kingdom is 7 inches, and in India 30 inches in the\r\nEastern Himalayas.\r\n\r\nBut much shorter periods than twenty-four hours have to be dealt with.\r\nThe following figures are given by Chamier (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._,\r\nvol. cxxxiv.) as applicable to New South Wales, and he considers\r\nthat they are fair guides, erring on the side of safety, for other\r\ncountries:--\r\n\r\n  Duration of fall in hours     1     4    12   24\r\n  Ratio of fall to maximum\r\n    daily fall                  ¼     ½     ¾    1\r\n\r\nThe above figures are probably safe for England. For India the case is\r\nfar otherwise. The following falls have been observed there:--\r\n\r\n  +----------+-------+--------------+--------+\r\n  |  Period. | Fall. |Rate per Hour.|Remarks.|\r\n  +----------+-------+--------------+--------+\r\n  |          |Inches.|   Inches.    |        |\r\n  |7 hours   | 10    |      1·43    |        |\r\n  |4·5 hours |  7·7  |      1·7     |        |\r\n  |2 hours   |  8    |        4     |        |\r\n  |1 hour    |  5    |        5     |        |\r\n  |20 minutes|  1·6  |      4·8     |        |\r\n  |10 minutes|  1    |        6     |        |\r\n  +----------+-------+--------------+--------+\r\n\r\nThe falls of 1 inch in ten minutes were frequently observed near the\r\nhead of the Upper Jhelum Canal, a place where the annual rainfall is\r\nnot more than 30 inches (see also CHAP. XII., _Art. 1_). In some parts\r\nof the Eastern Himalayas, where 30 inches of rain has fallen in a day,\r\nit is possible that 8 inches may have fallen in an hour. In England 4\r\ninches has fallen in an hour. The heaviest falls in short periods do\r\nnot usually occur in the wettest years, and they may occur in very dry\r\nyears. Nor do they always occur on a very wet day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF INFORMATION CONCERNING STREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.=--The information which is required concerning\r\nstreams depends on the character of the stream and on the nature of the\r\nwork which is to be done. For the present let it be supposed that the\r\nstream is large and perennial. Other kinds of streams will be dealt\r\nwith in _Arts. 6_ and _7_. In dealing with a large perennial stream it\r\nis nearly always necessary to know the approximate highest and lowest\r\nwater-levels, and these can generally be ascertained by local inquiry,\r\ncombined with observations of water marks; but a higher level than the\r\nhighest known and a lower level than the lowest known are always liable\r\nto occur, and must to some extent be allowed for. If navigation exists\r\nor is to be arranged for, the highest and lowest levels consistent with\r\nnavigation must be ascertained. The highest such level depends chiefly\r\non the heights of bridges. A plan to a fairly large scale is also\r\nnecessary in most cases.\r\n\r\nIf an embankment to keep out floods is to be made along a river which\r\nis so large that its flood-level cannot be appreciably affected by the\r\nconstruction of the work, it may be necessary to obtain information\r\nonly as to the actual flood-levels, and as to the extent to which\r\nthe stream is liable to erode its bank. If a length of the bank of a\r\nstream has to be protected against scour, it is necessary to know of\r\nwhat materials the bed and bank are composed, and whether the channel\r\nis liable to changes and to what extent. It is also desirable to know\r\nto what extent the water transports solids, if any. In some kinds of\r\nprotective work these solids are utilised.\r\n\r\nBut in cases where the stream is to be much interfered with, it is\r\nnecessary to have full information concerning it, not only as regards\r\nwater-levels, changes in the channel, and transport of solids, but as\r\nregards the longitudinal profile and cross-sections, and the discharges\r\ncorresponding to different water-levels. The collection of some of this\r\ninformation, particularly as to the water-levels and discharges at\r\ndifferent times of the year and in floods, may occupy a considerable\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMethods of ascertaining the quantity of silt carried in the water of\r\na stream are described in CHAP. IV., _Art. 4_. Remarks regarding the\r\nother kinds of information required--the stream being still supposed to\r\nbe large and perennial--are given in _Arts. 2_ to _5_ of this chapter.\r\nThe degree of accuracy required in the information depends, however,\r\non the importance of the work, and sometimes the procedure can be\r\nsimplified. Detailed remarks on gauges and on the instruments used and\r\nmethods adopted for observing discharges and surface slopes, are given\r\nin _Hydraulics_, CHAP. VIII. and Appendix H.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Stream Gauges.=--Unless the stream being dealt with is an\r\nartificial one, it is unlikely that the flow in the reach with which\r\nthe work is concerned will be uniform. The rise and fall of the water\r\nat one place cannot therefore be correctly inferred from those at\r\nanother. It will be desirable to have two gauges, either read daily\r\nor else automatically, recording the water-level, one near each end\r\nof the reach concerned, with intermediate gauges if the reach is very\r\nlong. If, in or near the reach, there is already a gauge which has been\r\nregularly read, it may be sufficient to set up only one new gauge,\r\nand to read it only for such a period of time as will give a good\r\nrange of water-level, and to compare the readings with those of the\r\nold gauge. The readings of the new gauge for water-levels outside the\r\nrange of those observed can then be inferred, but if the stream is very\r\nirregular this may involve some trouble (_Art. 4_).\r\n\r\nIn the case of a large stream which shifts its course, the reading\r\nof a gauge does not give a proper indication of the water-level. In\r\nother words, the distance of the gauge from the two ends of the reach\r\nis subject to alteration. The case is the same as if the stream was\r\nstable and the gauge was shifted about. In such a stream there ought,\r\nif accuracy is required, to be a group of two or more gauges for each\r\npoint where there would be only one if the stream was not a shifting\r\none. Also, owing to erosion of the bank or the formation of a sandbank,\r\nit may often be necessary to shift the gauge. When possible it should\r\nbe kept in a fixed line laid down at right angles to the general\r\ndirection of the stream. When shifted, its zero level should be altered\r\nin such a way that the reading at the new site at the time of shifting\r\nis the same as it was before shifting. When the gauge is moved back\r\nto the original site its zero should be placed at its original level,\r\nthough this may give rise to a sudden jump in the reading for the\r\nreason given in the first sentence of this paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Plan and Sections.=--Making a survey and plan, and laying down on\r\nit the lines for longitudinal and cross-sections, and taking levels\r\nfor the sections, are ordinary operations of surveying. If any land\r\nis liable to be flooded, its boundaries should be shown on the plan\r\nand on some of the cross-sections. Unless the water is shallow, it is\r\nnecessary to obtain the bed levels from the water-level by soundings,\r\nthe level of a peg at the water-level having been obtained by\r\nlevelling. All the sections should show the water-level as it was at\r\nsome particular time, but the water-level will probably have altered\r\nwhile the survey was in progress, and allowance must be made for this.\r\nThe pegs at all the cross-sections and on both banks of the stream--for\r\nthe water-levels at opposite banks may not be exactly the same--may,\r\nfor instance, be driven down to the water-level when it is steady,\r\nand thereafter any changes in it noted and the soundings corrected\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain what changes are occurring in the channel it may\r\nbe necessary to repeat the soundings at intervals and, if there is much\r\nerosion of the bank, to make fresh plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Discharge Observations.=--For a large stream it is necessary to\r\nobserve the discharges by taking cross-sections and measuring the\r\nvelocity. If there is a sufficient range of water-levels, it will\r\nbe possible to make actual observations of a sufficient number of\r\ndischarges. If soundings cannot, owing to the depth or velocity, be\r\ntaken at high water, they must be inferred from those previously\r\ntaken, but this does not allow for changes in the channel, which are\r\nsometimes considerable and rapid. If there is not a sufficient range of\r\nwater-level, the discharges for some water-levels must be calculated\r\nfrom those at other water-levels. In this case observations of the\r\nsurface slope will be required, and the discharge site should be so\r\nselected that no abrupt changes in the channel will come within the\r\nlength over which the observations are to extend. This length should\r\nbe such that the fall in the water surface will be great enough to\r\nadmit of accurate observation. If the cross-section of the stream is\r\nnearly uniform throughout the whole of this length, or if it varies\r\nin a regular manner, being greatest at one end of the length and\r\nleast at the other end. the differences in the areas of the two end\r\nsections being not more than 10 or 12 per cent., then the velocity\r\nand cross-section of the stream can be observed in the usual manner\r\nat the centre of the length; but otherwise they should be observed at\r\nintervals over the whole length, or at least in two places, one where\r\nthe section is small and one where it is great, and the mean taken. Or\r\nthe velocity can be observed at only one cross-section and calculated\r\nfor the others by simple proportion and the mean taken. The coefficient\r\nC can then be found from the formula C = V/√(RS). To find the discharge\r\nfor a higher or lower water-level, the change in the value of C\r\ncorresponding to the change in R can be estimated by looking out the\r\nvalues of C in tables, and the discharge calculated by using the new\r\nvalues of C and R and the new sectional area, S remaining unaltered.\r\nBut if the channel is such that, with the new water-level, a change in\r\nS is likely to have occurred, this change must be allowed for. Any such\r\nchange will be due to the changed relative effects of irregularities,\r\neither in the length over which the observations extended or downstream\r\nof that length. The effect of irregularities in the bed is greatest at\r\nlow water. The effect of lateral narrowings is greatest at high water.\r\nSince a change of 10 per cent. in S causes a change of only 5 per cent.\r\nin V, it will usually suffice to draw on the longitudinal section the\r\nactual water surface observed and to sketch the probable surface for\r\nthe new water-level. If the whole channel is fairly regular for a long\r\ndistance downstream of the discharge site, no slope observations need\r\nbe made nor need several sections be taken in order to find V. The\r\nchanged value of C should, however, be estimated in the manner above\r\nindicated. For this purpose any probable value of S will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Discharge Curves and Tables.=--Ordinarily it will be possible,\r\nby plotting the observed discharges as ordinates, the gauge readings\r\nbeing the abscissæ, to draw a discharge curve and from it construct a\r\ndischarge table. Unless the channel is of firm material and not liable\r\nto change, there are likely to be discrepancies among the observed\r\ndischarges, so that a regular discharge curve will not pass through\r\nall the plotted points. If the discrepancies are not serious, they can\r\nbe disregarded and the curve drawn so as to pass as near as possible\r\nto all the points, but otherwise trouble and uncertainty may arise.\r\nThe soundings should be compared in order to see whether changes\r\nhave occurred in the channel. If such changes do not account for the\r\ndiscrepancies, the cause must be sought for in some of the recorded\r\nvelocities. If no sources of error in these can be found, such as\r\nwind, it is possible that the velocity has been affected by a change\r\nin the surface slope owing to some change in the channel downstream\r\nof the length. Failing this explanation, the discrepancies must be set\r\ndown to unknown causes. With an unstable channel and where accuracy\r\nis required, the sectional areas and velocities should be regularly\r\ntabulated or plotted so that changes may be watched and investigated.\r\nTo do this it may be necessary to take surface slope observations, or\r\nto set up extra gauges which will show any changes in the slope.\r\n\r\nIf, downstream of the discharge site, there is any place where\r\naffluents come in and bring varying volumes of water, or where gates\r\nor sluices are manipulated, and if the influence of this extends up to\r\nthe discharge site, the water-level there no longer depends only on\r\nthe discharge, and a discharge table must be one with several columns\r\nwhose headings indicate various conditions at the place where the\r\ndisturbances occur.\r\n\r\nIn order to show how the gauge readings and discharges vary from day to\r\nday throughout the year, a diagram should be prepared showing the gauge\r\nreadings and discharges as ordinates, the abscissæ being the times in\r\ndays starting from any convenient date as zero. Such a diagram, showing\r\nonly gauge readings, is given in fig. 56, CHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =Small Streams.=--Small streams will now be considered, those, for\r\ninstance, which are too small to be navigable and which occasionally\r\nrun dry or nearly dry. If the water of the stream is to be stored for\r\nwater supply, power or irrigation purposes, full information as to\r\ndischarges and silt carried will be required. If the stream is small\r\nenough the discharges can be ascertained by means of a weir of planks.\r\nThe discharge is then known from the gauge readings. Cross-sections\r\nand large scale plans will not be required unless the stream is to be\r\naltered or embanked. If the water, instead of being stored, is to be\r\ngot rid of, as in drainage work, the only information required as to\r\ndischarges is the maximum discharge. Large scale plans, sections, or\r\ninformation as to silt or water-levels (except as a means of estimating\r\nthe discharge) will not be required unless the stream is to be altered\r\nor embanked.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases of small streams the information required is\r\ngenerally, as has been seen, less than in the case of large perennial\r\nstreams, but it is generally more difficult to obtain. If the stream\r\nis ill-defined or its flow intermittent, especially if it is also very\r\nsmall and the place sparsely inhabited, it may be difficult to obtain\r\nany discharge figures except those based on figures of rainfall. The\r\nmethod of obtaining such figures has been stated in CHAP. II. The\r\nfigures required are those of the annual and monthly fall when the\r\nwater is to be stored, and those of the greatest fall in a short period\r\nwhen the water is to be got rid of. Of course a plan of the catchment\r\narea is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. =Intermittent Streams.=--In the case of large streams whose flow is\r\nintermittent, the information required will, as before, depend upon the\r\ncircumstances. Such streams occur in many countries. The difficulty\r\nin obtaining information is often very great. To obtain figures of\r\ndaily discharge a gauge must be set up in the stream and a register\r\nkept. The chief difficulty in an out-of-the-way place is likely to\r\nbe the obtaining correct information as to the maximum discharge.\r\nInformation, derived from reports or from supposed flood marks, as to\r\nthe highest water-level, may be inaccurate, and information based on\r\nrainfall figures may be extremely doubtful owing to the large size of\r\nthe catchment area, the absence of rain gauges, and the difficulty,\r\nespecially if the rain is not heavy, in estimating the available fall.\r\nAll sources of information must be utilised and, whenever possible,\r\nobservations should be made over a long period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. =Remarks.=--Very much remains to be done in collecting and\r\npublishing information concerning the ratio of the discharges to the\r\nrainfall. By observing a fall of rain and the discharge of a stream\r\nbefore and after the fall, it is possible to ascertain the figures\r\nfor that occasion, but they will not hold good for all occasions.\r\nContinuous observations are required. The chief obstacle is the\r\nexpense. Not only have measuring weirs and apparatus for automatically\r\nrecording the water-level to be provided, but the weirs would often\r\ncause flooding of land involving payment of compensation. The most\r\nsuitable places for making observations are those where reservoirs for\r\nwater-works exist or are about to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SILTING AND SCOURING ACTION OF STREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.=--When flowing water carries solid substances\r\nin suspension, they are known as “silt.” Material is also moved by\r\nbeing rolled along the bed of the stream. The difference between silt\r\nand rolled material is one of degree and not of kind. Material of\r\none kind may be rolled and carried alternately. The quantity of silt\r\npresent in each cubic foot of water is called the “charge” of silt.\r\nSilt consists chiefly of mud and fine sand; rolled material of sand,\r\ngravel, shingle, and boulders. When a stream erodes its channel, it is\r\nsaid to “scour.” When it deposits material in its channel, it is said\r\nto “silt.” Both terms are used irrespective of whether the material is\r\nsilt or rolled material. A stream of given velocity and depth can carry\r\nonly a certain charge of silt. When it is carrying this it is said to\r\nbe “fully charged.”\r\n\r\nIf a stream has power to scour any particular material from its\r\nchannel, it has power to transport it; but the converse is not true.\r\nIf the material is hard or coherent, the stream may have far more\r\ndifficulty in eroding it than in merely keeping it moving. And there is\r\ngenerally a little more difficulty even when the material is soft.\r\n\r\nSilting or scour may affect the bed of a channel or the sides or both.\r\nThe channel may thus decrease or increase in width or--if one bank is\r\naffected more than, or in a different manner to, the other--alter its\r\nposition laterally whether or not it is altering its bed level, and\r\n_vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThe cross-section of a stream is generally “shallow,” _i.e._ the width\r\nof the bed is greater than the combined submerged lengths of the sides,\r\nand the action on the bed is generally greater than on the sides.\r\n\r\nSilting and scouring are generally regular or irregular in their action\r\naccording as the flow is regular or irregular, that is, according as\r\nthe channel is free or not from abrupt changes and eddies. In a uniform\r\ncanal fed from a river, the deposit in the head reach of the canal\r\nforms a wedge-shaped mass, the depth of the deposit decreasing with\r\na fair approach to uniformity. Salient angles or places alongside of\r\nobstructions are most liable to scour, and deep hollows or recesses\r\nto silt. Eddies have exceptionally strong scouring power. Immediately\r\ndownstream of an abrupt change scour is often severe. An abrupt change\r\nis one, whether of sectional area or direction of flow, and whether or\r\nnot accompanied by a junction or bifurcation, which is so sudden as to\r\ncause eddies. The hole scoured alongside of an obstruction may extend\r\nto its upstream side, though there is generally little initial tendency\r\nto scour there. An obstruction is anything causing an abrupt decrease\r\nin any part of the cross-section of a stream, whether or not there is a\r\ndecrease in the whole cross-section, _e.g._ a bridge pier or spur.\r\n\r\nMost streams vary greatly at different times both in volume and\r\nvelocity and in the quantity of material brought into them. Hence the\r\naction is not constant. A stream may silt at one season and scour at\r\nanother, maintaining a steady average. When this happens to a moderate\r\nextent, or when the stream never silts or scours appreciably, it is\r\nsaid to be in “permanent régime,” or “stable.” Most streams in earthen\r\nchannels are either just stable and no more, or are unstable.\r\n\r\nWaves, whether due to wind or other agency, may cause scour, especially\r\nof the banks. Their effect on the bed becomes less as the depth of\r\nwater increases, but does not cease altogether at a depth of 21 feet,\r\nas has been supposed. Salt water possesses a power of causing mud, but\r\nnot sand, to deposit.\r\n\r\n_Arts. 2_, _3_, and _6_ of this chapter refer to action on the bed of a\r\nstream. Action on the sides will be considered in _Art. 7_.\r\n\r\nWeeds usually grow only in water which has so low a velocity that it\r\ncarries no silt to speak of, but if any silt is introduced the weeds\r\ncause a deposit. The weeds also thrive on such a deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Rolled Material.=--If a number of bodies have similar shapes, and\r\nif D is the diameter of one of them and V the velocity of the water\r\nrelatively to it, the rolling force is theoretically as V^2 D^2, and\r\nthe resisting force or weight as D^3. If these are just balanced, D\r\nvaries as V^2, or the diameters of similarly shaped bodies which can\r\njust be rolled are as V^2 and their weights as V^6. From practical\r\nobservations, it seems that the diameters do not vary quite so rapidly\r\nas they would by the above law, the weights being more nearly as V^5.\r\n\r\nLet a stream of pure water having a depth D, and with boulders on its\r\nbed, have a velocity V just sufficient to move them very slowly. Any\r\nlarger boulders would not be moved. Any smaller boulders would move\r\nmore quickly. Similarly, fine sand would be rolled more quickly than\r\ncoarse sand. If the velocity of the stream increases, larger boulders\r\nwould be moved. Streams are thus constantly sorting out the materials\r\nwhich they roll. If the bed is examined it will be found that large\r\nboulders exist only down to a certain point, smaller boulders, shingle,\r\ngravel, coarse sand and fine sand following in succession.\r\n\r\nIf the water, instead of being pure, is supposed to contain silt, this\r\nmay affect its velocity--it is not, however, known to do so--but, given\r\na certain velocity, it is not likely that the rolling power of the\r\nstream is much affected by its containing silt.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes supposed that increased depth gives increased rolling\r\npower, because of the increased pressure, but this is not so. The\r\nincreased pressure due to depth acts on both the upstream and\r\ndownstream sides of a body. It is moved only by the pressure due to the\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\nWhen sand is rolled along the bed of a stream there is usually a\r\nsuccession of abrupt falls in the bed. After each fall there is a long\r\ngentle upward slope till the next fall is reached. The sand is rolled\r\nup the long slope and falls over the steep one. It soon becomes buried.\r\nThe positions of the falls of course keep moving downstream. The height\r\nof a fall in a large channel is perhaps 6 inches or 1 foot, and the\r\ndistance between the falls 20 or 30 feet. A fall does not usually\r\nextend straight across the bed but zigzags.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said that the inclination of the bed of a stream,\r\nwhen high, facilitates scour, the material rolling more easily down a\r\nsteep inclined plane. The inclination is nearly always too small to\r\nhave any appreciable direct effect. The inclination of the surface of\r\nthe stream of course affects its velocity, and this is the chief factor\r\nin the case.\r\n\r\nA sudden rise in the bed of a stream does not necessarily cause rolled\r\nmaterials to accumulate there, except perhaps to the extent necessary\r\nto form a gentle slope. Frequently even this slope is not formed,\r\nespecially if the rolled material is only sand. The eddies stir it up\r\nand it is carried on. The above remarks apply also to weirs or other\r\nlocal rises in the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Materials carried in Suspension.=--It has long been known that\r\nthe scouring and transporting power of a stream increases with its\r\nvelocity. Observations made by Kennedy have shown that its power to\r\ncarry silt decreases as the depth of water increases (_Min. Proc. Inst.\r\nC.E._, vol. cxix.). The power is probably derived from the eddies which\r\nare produced at the bed. Every suspended particle tends to sink, if its\r\nspecific gravity is greater than unity. It is prevented from sinking by\r\nthe upward components of the eddies. If V is the velocity of the stream\r\nand D its depth, the force exerted by the eddies generated on 1 square\r\nfoot of the bed is greater as the velocity is greater, and is probably\r\nas V^2 or thereabouts. But, given the charge of silt, the weight of\r\nsilt in a vertical column of water whose base is 1 square foot is as D.\r\nTherefore the power of a stream to support silt is as V^2 and inversely\r\nas D. The silt charge which a stream of depth D can carry is as V^{½}.\r\nV is called the “critical velocity” for that depth, and is designated\r\nas V_{0}.\r\n\r\nThe full charge must be affected by the nature of the silt. The\r\nspecific gravity of fine mud is not much greater than that of water,\r\nwhile that of sand is about 1·5 times as great. Moreover, the particles\r\nof sand are far larger than the particles of mud. If two streams of\r\nequal depths and velocities are fully charged, one with particles of\r\nmud and the other with particles of sand, the latter will sink more\r\nrapidly and will have to be more frequently thrown up. They will be\r\nfewer in number. From some observations referred to by Kennedy (_Punjab\r\nIrrigation Paper_, No. 9, “Silt and Scour in the Sirhind Canal,” 1904),\r\nit appears that in a fully charged stream which carried 1/3300 of\r\nits volume of a mixture of mud and sand of various grades, sand of a\r\nparticular degree of coarseness formed only 1/35,000 of the volume of\r\nthe water, but that when the same stream was clear and was turned on to\r\na bed of the coarse sand it took up 1/15,000 of its volume. It would\r\nthus appear that the full charge of silt is less as its coarseness and\r\nheaviness are greater. This is in accordance with the laws mentioned\r\nabove (_Art. 2_, par. 1). See also CHAP. V., _Art. 2_, last paragraph.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that fine mud is carried almost equally into all\r\nparts of the stream, whereas sand is nearly always found in greater\r\nproportion near the bed and, as before remarked, some materials may\r\nbe rolled and suspended alternately. The charge of mixed silt which a\r\nstream can carry is, no doubt, something between the charge which it\r\ncan carry of each kind separately, but the laws of this part of the\r\nsubject are not yet fully known. From the observations above referred\r\nto, Kennedy concludes that a canal with velocity V_{0} will carry in\r\nsuspension 1/3300 to 1/5000 of its volume of silt, according as it is\r\ncharged with sand of all classes or only with the heavier classes.\r\n\r\nLet a stream be carrying a full charge of any kind of silt. Then if\r\nthere is any reduction in velocity, a deposit will occur--unless there\r\nis also a reduction of depth--until the charge of silt is reduced\r\nagain to the full charge for the stream. The deposit generally occurs\r\nslowly, and extends over a considerable length of channel. The heavier\r\nmaterials are, of course, deposited first. If a stream is not fully\r\ncharged, it tends to become so by scouring its channel. It is generally\r\nbelieved that a stream fully charged with silt cannot scour silt from\r\nits channel, or bear any introduction of further silt. This seems to\r\nbe correct in the main, but the remarks made in the latter part of the\r\npreceding paragraph must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated (_Art. 2_) that a weir or a sudden rise in the bed\r\ndoes not necessarily cause an accumulation of rolled material. It never\r\ncauses a deposit of suspended material unless it causes a heading up\r\nand reduction of velocity to below the critical velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Methods of Investigation.=--The quantity of silt in water is found\r\nby taking specimens of the water and evaporating it or, if the silt is\r\npresent in great quantity, leaving it to settle for twelve hours--an\r\nounce of alum can be added for every 10 cubic feet of water to\r\naccelerate settlement--drawing off the water by a syphon, and heating\r\nthe deposit to dry it. The deposit is then measured or weighed. It is\r\nbest to weigh it. If clay is filled into a measure, the volume depends\r\ngreatly on the manner in which it is filled in. When silt deposits in\r\nlarge quantities in a channel, or when heavy scour occurs, the volume\r\ndeposited or scoured is ascertained by taking careful sections of the\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nSilt is best classified by observing its rate of fall through still\r\nwater. A sand which falls at ·10 feet per second is, in India, called\r\nclass (·1), and mixed sand which falls at rates varying from ·1 to ·2\r\nfeet per second is called class ·1/·2. Fig. 1 shows a sand separator\r\ndesigned by Kennedy. The scale is ⅛. It has a syphon action, and the\r\nrate of flow can be altered by altering the length of the exit pipe.\r\nSuppose it is desired to measure the sand of class (·10) and all\r\nheavier kinds. The pipe is adjusted so as to give a velocity of ·1 foot\r\nper second to the upward flowing water, which then carries off all silt\r\nof class (·10) or finer. All heavier silt falls into the glass tube.\r\nIt can be separated again by being mixed with water and passed through\r\nthe instrument again, the velocity of flow through the instrument being\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of silt present at various depths can be found by pumping\r\nspecimens of water through pipes. At each change of depth the pipe,\r\ndelivery hose, etc., should be cleaned. Allowance must be made for the\r\nvelocity of ascent of the water up the pipe. Suppose this to be 1·4\r\nfeet per second. Then the velocity of sand of class (·2) would be 1·2\r\nfeet per second, and the quantity of sand actually found in the water\r\nwould have to be increased by one-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Quantity and Distribution of Silt.=--The quantity of silt present\r\nin water varies enormously. Fine mud, even though sufficient to\r\ndiscolour the water, may be so small in volume that it only deposits\r\nwhen the water is still, and even then deposits slowly. In the river\r\nTay, near Perth, the silt was found to be ordinarily 1/10,000 of the\r\nvolume of water, and at low water only 1/28,000. In the river Sutlej at\r\nRupar, near where it issues from the Himalayas, the silt in the flood\r\nseason is extremely heavy. Out of 360 observations, made at various\r\ndepths, during the flood seasons of four successive years, in water\r\nwhose depth ranged up to 12 feet, the silt was once found to be 2·1\r\nper cent. by weight of that of the water. It was more than 1·2 per\r\ncent. on four occasions, and more than 0·3 per cent. (or 3 in 1000)\r\non sixty-four occasions. Generally about one-half of the silt was\r\nclay and sand of classes finer than (·10), about one-third was sand\r\nof class ·1/·2, and the residue was sand of class ·2/·3. The sand of\r\nthe river Chenab is generally coarser than that of the Sutlej. There\r\nare very great differences in the degree of coarseness of river sand.\r\nThe sand in any river becomes finer and finer as the gradient flattens\r\nin approaching the sea. Sea sand has been found to be of class (·20).\r\nIn the Sirhind Canal, which takes out from the Sutlej at Rupar, the\r\nmaximum quantity of suspended silt observed in the four flood seasons\r\nwas 0·7 per cent., on one occasion out of 270, and it exceeded 0·3 per\r\ncent. on twenty-five occasions. About 80 per cent. of the silt was clay.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the paper quoted, it is stated that the silt\r\nsuspended in the canal water averaged, during the whole of one flood\r\nseason, about 1/1700 of the volume of the water. This would be about\r\n1/1200 by weight. The silt deposited in the bed of the canal, in a\r\nperiod of a few days, was sometimes as much as 1/1000 of the water\r\nwhich had passed along, and occasionally as much as 1/500. It was\r\nnearly all sand, only about 3 per cent. being clay. Silt of classes\r\nfiner than (·1) gave no trouble, and were to be eliminated in future\r\ninvestigations. In a canal, as in a river, the sand on the bed becomes\r\nfiner the further from the head.\r\n\r\nRegarding the distribution of the silt at various depths, in water 5 to\r\n17 feet deep, the quantity of silt near the bed may, when the charge is\r\nheavy and consists of mixed silt, be 1¼ to 3 times that at the surface.\r\nIf the charge is fine mud, there is likely to be as much silt at the\r\nsurface as near the bed, if sand, there may be none at the surface and\r\nlittle in the upper part of the stream.\r\n\r\nIn all cases single observations are likely to show extraordinarily\r\ndiscordant results; a number of observations must be made at each point\r\nand averaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =Practical Formulæ and Figures.=--A stream which carries silt\r\ngenerally rolls materials along its bed. The proportion between the\r\nquantities of material rolled and carried is never known, and this\r\nmakes it impossible to frame an exact formula applicable to such cases,\r\nbut Kennedy, from his observations on canals fully charged with the\r\nheavy silt and fine sand usually found in Indian rivers near the hills,\r\narrived at the empirical formula for critical velocities\r\n\r\n    V = ·84 D^{·64}\r\n\r\nThe observations were made on the Bari Doab Canal and its branches, the\r\nwidths of the channels varying from 8 feet to 91 feet, and the depths\r\nof water from 2·3 feet to 7·3 feet. The beds of these channels have,\r\nin the course of years, adjusted themselves by silting or scouring, so\r\nthat there is a state of permanent régime, each stream carrying its\r\nfull charge of silt, and the charges in all being about equal. From\r\nfurther observations referred to above (_Art. 3_, par. 2) it appears\r\nthat this kind of silt forms about 1/3300 of the volume of the water,\r\nand that on the Sirhind Canal, sand coarser than the (·10) class,\r\nformed 1/35,000 of the volume of water.\r\n\r\nThe formula gives the following critical velocities for various\r\ndepths:--\r\n\r\n   D =     1     2     3     4     5     6     7\r\n  V_{0} = ·84  1·30  1·70  2·04  2·35  2·64  2·92\r\n\r\n           D =      8     9    10\r\n          V_{0} = 3·18  3·43  3·67.\r\n\r\nIn Indian rivers not near the hills the silt carried is not so heavy,\r\nand the critical velocities are supposed to be about three-fourths of\r\nthe above. Thrupp (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. clxxi.) gives the\r\nfollowing ranges of velocities as those which will enable streams to\r\ncarry different kinds of silt. It does not appear that the streams\r\nwould be fully charged except at the higher figure given for each case.\r\n\r\n  D = 1·0              10·0\r\n  V = 1·5  to  2·3      3·5 to 4·5 (Coarse sand).\r\n  V =  ·95 to  1·5      2·3 to 3·5 (Heavy silt and fine sand).\r\n  V =  ·45 to   ·95     1·2 to 2·3 (Fine silt).\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the exact relations between D and V are yet\r\nknown, but it is of great practical importance to know that V must vary\r\nwith D. The precise manner in which it must vary does not, for moderate\r\nchanges, make very much difference. In designing a channel a suitable\r\nrelation of depth to velocity can be arranged for, and one quantity or\r\nthe other kept in the ascendant, according as scouring or silting is\r\nthe evil to be guarded against.\r\n\r\nThe old idea was that an increase in V, even if accompanied by an\r\nincrease in D, _e.g._ simply running a higher supply in a given\r\nchannel, gave increased silt-transporting power. In a stream of very\r\nshallow section this is probably correct, for V increases faster than\r\nD^{·64} (_Hydraulics_, CHAP. VI., _Art. 2_). In a stream of deep\r\nsection a decrease in D gives increased silt-transporting power.\r\nIf the discharge is fixed, a change in the depth or width must be\r\nmet by a change of the opposite kind in the other quantity. In this\r\ncase widening or narrowing the channel may be proper according to\r\ncircumstances. In a deep section widening will decrease the depth\r\nof water, and may also increase the velocity, and it will thus give\r\nincreased scouring power. In a shallow section, narrowing will increase\r\nthe velocity more than it increases D^{·64}. In a medium section it is\r\na matter of exact calculation to find out whether widening or narrowing\r\nwill improve matters.\r\n\r\nIf the water entering a channel has a higher silt-charge than can be\r\ncarried in the channel, some of it must deposit. Suppose an increased\r\ndischarge to be run, and that this gives a higher silt-carrying power\r\nand a smaller rate of deposit per cubic foot of discharge, it does not\r\nfollow that the deposit will be less. The quantity of silt entering\r\nthe channel is now greater than before. Owing to want of knowledge\r\nregarding the proportions of silt and rolled material, and to want of\r\nexactness in the formulæ, reliable calculations regarding proportions\r\ndeposited cannot be made.\r\n\r\nThe channels in which the observations above referred to were made have\r\nall assumed nearly rectangular cross-sections, the sides having become\r\nvertical by the deposit on them of finer silt; but the formula probably\r\napplies approximately to any channel if D is the mean depth from side\r\nto side, and V the mean velocity in the whole section.\r\n\r\nIf the ratio of V to D differs in different parts of a cross-section,\r\nthere is a tendency towards deposit in the parts where the ratio is\r\nleast, or to scour where it is greatest. There is a tendency for the\r\nsilt-charge to adjust itself, that is, to become less where the above\r\nratio is less, but the irregular movements of the stream cause a\r\ntransference of water among all parts, and this tends to equalise the\r\nsilt-charge.\r\n\r\nDubuat gives the following as the velocities close to the bed which\r\nwill enable a stream to scour or roll various materials. The bed\r\nvelocity is probably less than the mean velocity in the ratio of about\r\n·6 to 1 in rough channels, and about ·7 to 1 in smooth channels:--\r\n\r\n  Gravel as large as peas           ·70 feet per second\r\n    ”           ”    French beans  1·0   ”    ”    ”\r\n    ”  1 inch in diameter          2·25  ”    ”    ”\r\n  Pebbles 1½ inch in diameter      3·33  ”    ”    ”\r\n  Heavy shingle                    4·0   ”    ”    ”\r\n  Soft rock, brick, earthenware    4·5   ”    ”    ”\r\n  Rock of various kinds            6·0   ”    ”    ”\r\n                                     and upward.\r\n\r\nThe figures for brick, earthenware, and rock can apply only to\r\nmaterials of exceedingly poor quality. Masonry of good hard stone\r\nwill stand 20 feet per second, and instances have occurred in which\r\nbrickwork has withstood a velocity of 90 feet per second without injury\r\nso long as the water did not carry sand and merely flowed along the\r\nbrickwork. If there are abrupt changes in the stream, causing eddies,\r\nor if there is impact and shock, or if sand, gravel, shingle, or\r\nboulders are liable to be carried along, velocities must be limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. =Action on the Sides of a Channel.=--It has been seen that the laws\r\nof silting and scour on the bed of a channel depend on the ratio of the\r\ndepth to the velocity. The same laws probably hold good in the case of\r\na gently shelving bank, so that here again V ought to vary as D^{·64}.\r\nThe velocity near the angle where the slope meets the water surface\r\nseems to decrease faster than D^{·64}. At all events, silt tends to\r\ndeposit in the angle and the slope to become steep.\r\n\r\nWhen the slope is steep the law seems to be different, the tendency for\r\ndeposit or scour to occur on the bank depending on the actual velocity\r\nwithout much relation to the depth. The velocity very near to a steep\r\nbank is always low relatively to that in the rest of the stream. Thus\r\nthere is often a tendency for silt to deposit on the bank, especially\r\nin the upper part, and for the side to become vertical except for a\r\nslight rounding at the lower corner. A bank may receive deposits when\r\nthe bed may be receiving none, and it may have a persistent tendency\r\nto grow out towards the stream. The growth of the bank is generally\r\nregular, the line of the bank being preserved, but it may be irregular,\r\nespecially if vegetation, other than small grass, becomes established\r\non the new deposits.\r\n\r\nWhen scour of the sides of a channel occurs it may occur by direct\r\naction of the stream on the sides near the water-level, or by action\r\nat or near the toe of the slope, which causes the upper part of the\r\nbank to fall in. Such falling in is generally more or less irregular,\r\nand the bank presents an uneven appearance. The fallen pieces of bank\r\nmay remain, more or less intact, especially if they are held together\r\nby the roots of grasses, etc., where they fell, and prevent further\r\nscour occurring along the toe of the slope. Falling in of banks is most\r\nliable to occur in large streams and with light soils. It may be caused\r\nby the waves which are produced by steamers and boats or, especially in\r\nbroad streams, by wind. The action on the banks at bends is discussed\r\nin _Art. 8_.\r\n\r\nThus in designing a channel according to the principles laid down in\r\n_Art. 6_, the question of action on the sides of the channel has to\r\nbe dealt with as follows. Whether or not the velocity is to be low,\r\nrelatively to the depth, _i.e._ whether or not deposit on the bed\r\nis more likely to occur than scour, care can be taken not to make it\r\nactually too low, and not to make it actually too high, particularly if\r\nthe soil is light and friable. With ordinary soils a mean velocity of\r\n3·3 feet per second in the channel is generally safe as regards scour\r\nof the sides. Any velocity of more than 3·5 feet per second may give\r\ntrouble. A velocity of less than 1 foot per second is likely to give\r\nrise to deposit on the sides.\r\n\r\nIn channels in alluvial soils the falling in of banks is sometimes said\r\nto occur more when the stream is falling than at other times. This has\r\nbeen noticed on both the Mississippi and the Indus. The cause has been\r\nsaid to be the draining out of water which had percolated into the\r\nbank, the water in flowing out carrying some sand with it. The effect\r\nof this cannot however be great.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. =Action at Bends.=--At a bend, owing to the action of centrifugal\r\nforce and to cross-currents caused thereby, there is a deposit near the\r\nconvex bank and a corresponding deepening--unless the bed is too hard\r\nto be scoured--near the concave bank. The water-level at the concave\r\nbank is slightly higher than at the convex bank. The greatest velocity\r\ninstead of being in mid-stream is nearer the concave bank.\r\n\r\nAs the transverse current and transverse surface slope cannot commence\r\nor end abruptly, there is a certain length in which they vary. In\r\nthis length the radius of curvature of the bend and the form of the\r\ncross-section also tend to vary. This can often be seen in plans of\r\nriver bends, the curvature being less sharp towards the ends.\r\n\r\nWhen once a stream has assumed a curved form, be it ever so slight,\r\nthe tendency is for the bend to increase. The greater velocity and\r\ngreater depth near the concave bank react on each other, each inducing\r\nthe other. The concave bank is worn away, or becoming vertical by\r\nerosion near the bed, cracks, falls in, and is washed away, a deposit\r\nof silt occurring at the convex bank, so that the width of the stream\r\nremains tolerably constant. The bend may go on increasing, and it often\r\ntends to move downstream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIn fig. 2 the deep places are shown by dotted lines. Along the straight\r\ndotted line there is no deep place. Such a line would be used for a\r\nford. At low water it becomes a shoal. This is the chief reason why a\r\ntortuous stream at low water consists of alternate pools and rapids.\r\nIt is sometimes said that deep water occurs near to a steep hard bank.\r\nSuch deepening is due to bends or obstructions which give the current a\r\nset towards the bank, or it is due to irregularities in the bank which\r\ncause eddies. In a straight channel with even and regular banks there\r\nis no such deepening.\r\n\r\nWhen a bend has formed in a channel previously straight, the stream\r\nat the lower end of the bend, by setting against the opposite bank,\r\ntends to cause another bend of the opposite kind to the first. Thus\r\nthe tendency is for the stream to become tortuous and, while the\r\ntortuosity is slight, the length, and therefore the slope and velocity,\r\nare little affected; but the action may continue until the increase\r\nin the length of the stream materially flattens the slope, and the\r\nconsequent reduction in velocity causes erosion to cease. Or the stream\r\nduring a flood may find, along the chord of a bend, a direct route\r\nwith, of course, a steeper slope. Scouring a channel along this route\r\nit straightens itself, and its action then commences afresh. Short\r\ncuts of this kind do not, however, occur so frequently as is sometimes\r\nbelieved. In some streams the bends acquire a horse-shoe shape and the\r\nneck becomes very narrow and short cuts may then occur. Otherwise they\r\nare not common. V increases only as √(S), and if the country is covered\r\nwith vegetation it is not easy for a stream to scour out a new channel.\r\n\r\nThe effect of bends on the velocity of a stream is not well understood.\r\nIn case of a bend of 90° the increased resistance to flow when the bend\r\nis absolutely sudden (a sudden bend is known as an “elbow”) amounts\r\nperhaps to V^2/(2_g_). Whether it is greater or less in the case of\r\na gentle bend of 90° is not known. In the case of a pipe there is a\r\ncertain radius which gives a minimum resistance (_Hydraulics_, CHAP.\r\nV.). The increased resistance at a bend is due partly to the fact that\r\nthe maximum velocity is no longer in the centre of the stream, and\r\npartly to the fact that the velocities at the different parts of the\r\ncross-section have to be rearranged at the commencement of the bend and\r\nagain at its termination. Thus the effect of a bend of 45° is a good\r\ndeal more than half of that of a bend of 90°. Two bends of 45°, both\r\nin the same direction, with a straight reach between them, will cause\r\nmore resistance than a single bend of 90° with the straight reach above\r\nor below the bend. If the two bends of 45° are in different directions\r\nthe resistance will be still greater. A succession of sharp bends may\r\nproduce a serious effect, amounting to an increase in roughness of\r\nthe channel. A succession of gentle bends, of any considerable angle,\r\ncannot of course occur within a moderate length of channel.\r\n\r\nWhen there is head to spare there is clearly no objection to bends,\r\nexcept that the bank may need protection. At a place where the bank has\r\nin any case to be protected, _e.g._ at a weir, there is no objection to\r\nan elbow.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. =General Tendencies of Streams.=--Since the velocity is greater\r\nas the area of the cross-section is less, a stream always tends\r\nto scour where narrow or shallow, and to silt where wide or deep.\r\nThe cross-section thus tends to become uniform in size. Suppose\r\ntwo cross-sections to be equal in size but different in shape. The\r\nvelocities of the two sections will be equal. The tendency of the bed\r\nto silt will (_Art. 6_) be greater at the deeper section and, when\r\nsilting has occurred on the bed, the section will be reduced and there\r\nwill be a tendency to scour at the sides. Thus the cross-sections tend\r\nto become also uniform in shape. If a bank of silt has formed in a\r\nstream, the tendency is for scour to occur. There is also a tendency\r\nfor silt to deposit just below the point where the bank ends. Hence a\r\nsilt bank often moves downstream.\r\n\r\nOwing to the tendency to scour alongside of, or downstream of,\r\nobstructions (_Art. 1_), it is clear that a stream constantly tends to\r\ndestroy obstructions.\r\n\r\nThere is an obvious tendency for silt to deposit where the bed slope\r\nof a stream flattens, and for scour to take place where it steepens\r\n(_Hydraulics_, figs. 16 and 17, pp. 24 and 25), and thus the tendency\r\nis for the slope to become uniform.\r\n\r\nIn a natural stream flowing from hilly country to a lake or sea, the\r\nslope is steepest at the commencement and gradually flattens. There\r\nis thus a tendency for the bed to rise except at the mouth of the\r\nstream. This rising tends to increase the slope and velocity in the\r\nlower reaches, and this again enhances the tendency, described in the\r\npreceding article, of the stream to increase in tortuosity.\r\n\r\nWhen a silt-bearing stream overflows its banks the depth of water on\r\nthe flooded bank is probably small and its velocity very low, and a\r\ndeposit of silt takes place on the bank. When the deposit has reached\r\na certain height it acts like a weir on the water of the next flood,\r\nwhich flows quickly over it and, instead of raising it higher, deposits\r\nits silt further away from the stream. In this way a strip of country\r\nalong the stream gradually becomes raised, the raising being greatest\r\nclose to the stream. The country slopes downwards in going away from\r\nthe stream. In other words, the stream runs on a ridge. If the bank\r\nbecomes raised so high that flooding no longer occurs, the raising\r\naction ceases, but if, as is likely in alluvial country, the bed of the\r\nstream also rises, the action may continue and the ridge become very\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\nSome rivers have very wide and soft channels which are only filled\r\nfrom bank to bank in floods, if then. The deep stream winds about in\r\nthe channel, and the rest of it is occupied by sandbanks and minor\r\narms. The winding is the result of the velocity being too great for\r\nthe channel. The streams, especially the main stream, constantly shift\r\ntheir courses by scouring one bank or the other. Now and then the main\r\nstream takes a short cut, either down a minor arm or across an easily\r\neroded sandbank. This is a very different matter from a short cut\r\nacross high ground. The sandbanks receive deposits of silt in floods,\r\nbut are constantly being cut away at the sides. Such rivers frequently\r\nerode their banks to an extraordinary extent. The Indus sometimes cuts\r\ninto its bank 100 feet or more in a day, and it may cut for half a mile\r\nor more without cessation. The tortuosity of such a stream increases as\r\nit gets nearer the sea. The actual length of the Indus in the 400 miles\r\nnearest the sea is 39 per cent. greater than its course measured along\r\nthe bank. In the reach from the 600th to the 700th mile from the sea,\r\nthe difference is only 3 per cent. For a detailed description of some\r\nsuch rivers, see _Punjab Rivers and Works_.\r\n\r\nSometimes general statements are made regarding silting or scour in\r\nconnection, for instance, with a stream which is confined between\r\nembankments or training walls, or has overflowed its banks or is held\r\nup by a weir. It is impossible to say that any such condition, or any\r\ncondition, will cause silting or scour, unless the velocity depth and\r\nsilt charge are known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF INCREASING OR REDUCING SILTING OR SCOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.=--Most important works which affect the régime\r\nof a stream have some effect on its silting or scouring action, but\r\nthis is not generally their chief object. Such works will be dealt\r\nwith in due course, and the effects which they are likely to produce\r\non silting or scouring will be mentioned. In the present chapter only\r\nthose works and measures will be considered whose chief object is to\r\ncause a stream to alter its silting or scouring action. It does not\r\nmatter, so far as this discussion is concerned, whether the object\r\nis direct, _i.e._ concerned only with the particular place where the\r\neffect is to be produced, or indirect, as, for instance, where a stream\r\nis made to scour in order that it may deposit material further down the\r\nstream. The protection of banks from scour is considered in CHAP. VI.\r\nDredging is dealt with in CHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Production of Scour or Reduction of Silting.=--Sometimes the silt\r\non the bed of a stream is artificially stirred up by simple measures,\r\nas, for instance, by scrapers or harrows attached to boats which are\r\nallowed to drift with the stream, or by means of a cylinder which has\r\nclaw-like teeth projecting from its circumference and is rolled along\r\nthe bed, or by fitting up boats with shutters which are let down close\r\nto the bed and so cause a rush of water under them, or by anchoring\r\na steamer and working its screw propeller. It is thus possible to\r\ncause a great deal of local scour, but the silt tends to deposit again\r\nquickly, and it is not easy to keep any considerable length of channel\r\npermanently scoured. The system is suitable in a case in which a local\r\nshallow or sandbank is to be got rid of and deposit of silt a little\r\nfurther down is not objectionable. It may be suitable in a case in\r\nwhich the bed is to be scoured while a deposit of silt at the sides of\r\nthe channel is required, especially if some arrangement to encourage\r\nsilt deposit at the sides is used (_Art. 3_, par. 4; also CHAP. VI.,\r\n_Art. 3_).\r\n\r\nHolding back the water by means, for instance, of a regulator or\r\nmovable weir, and letting it in again with somewhat of a rush, will,\r\nif frequently repeated, have some effect in moving silt on in the\r\ndownstream reach. Regarding the upstream reach, it has been remarked\r\n(CHAP. IV., _Art. 3_) that a weir does not necessarily cause silt\r\ndeposit. If, in a stream which does not ordinarily silt, a regulator or\r\nmovable weir causes, when the water is headed up, some silt deposit,\r\nthe cessation of the heading up not only removes the tendency to silt,\r\nbut the section of the stream, at the place where the deposit occurred,\r\nis less than elsewhere, and there is thus a tendency to scour there. If\r\na regulator is alternately closed and opened, no permanent deposit of\r\nmuch consequence is likely to occur.\r\n\r\nA stream may be made to scour its channel by opening an escape or\r\nbranch. This causes a draw in the stream, and an increase in velocity\r\nfor a long distance upstream of the bifurcation (_Hydraulics_, CHAP.\r\nVII., _Art. 6_). This procedure is sometimes adopted on irrigation\r\ncanals. The escape is generally opened in order to reduce the quantity\r\nof water passing down, but it may be opened solely to induce scour or\r\nprevent silting. The floor of the escape head is usually higher than\r\nthe bed of the canal, but this does not interfere with operations\r\nexcept at low supplies. It may (CHAP. IV., _Art. 2_) have some effect\r\non the quantity of rolled material passed out of the escape.\r\n\r\nIf there is a weir in the river below the off-take of the canal, and\r\nif the escape runs back to the river and thus has a good fall, the\r\nscouring action in the canal may be very powerful.\r\n\r\nIf the main channel has a uniform slope throughout, the slope of its\r\nwater surface is greater upstream of the escape than downstream of the\r\nescape, and there is thus an abrupt reduction of velocity and possibly\r\na deposit of silt in the main channel below the escape. This may or\r\nmay not be objectionable. In the case of an irrigation canal, it is\r\nfar less objectionable than deposit in the head of the canal. The best\r\npoint for the off-take of any escape or scouring channel depends on\r\nthe position of the deposits in the main channel. The off-take should\r\nbe downstream of the chief deposits, but as near to all of them as\r\npossible. A breach in a bank acts of course in the same way as an\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nA stream of clear water when sent down a channel will scour it if the\r\nmaterial is sufficiently soft. In the case of the Sirhind Canal, it has\r\nalready been mentioned (CHAP. IV., _Art. 3_), that when the river water\r\nbecame clear after the floods the proportion of coarse sand, _i.e._\r\nsand above the (·10) class, carried by the canal water was about\r\n1/15,000 by volume. This was in the period from 22nd September to 7th\r\nOctober. From 8th to 23rd October the proportion averaged 1/32,000 from\r\n24th October to 8th November 1/44,000, and from 9th to 24th November\r\n1/85,000. The reason of this reduction was that the comparatively clear\r\nwater kept picking up the sand from the bed and moving it on, the finer\r\nkinds being moved most quickly. As the coarse sand left on the bed\r\nbecame less in quantity, the water took up less. It appears, however,\r\nthat the water also picked up some clay which was left, and that the\r\ntotal suspended silt in November was 1/9000 of the water. All the\r\nobservations mentioned in this paragraph appear to have been made at\r\nGarhi, 26 miles from the head of the canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Production of Silt Deposit.=--Works or measures for causing silt\r\ndeposit may be undertaken in order to cause silt deposit in specific\r\nplaces where it will be useful, or in order to free the water from\r\nsilt. Sometimes both objects are combined.\r\n\r\nIf a stream can be turned into a large pond or low ground--a bank being\r\nbuilt round it if necessary--it can be made to part with some or all of\r\nits silt whether rolled or suspended. Even if the pond is so large that\r\nthe velocity becomes imperceptible, the whole of the suspended matter\r\nwill not deposit unless it has sufficient time, but the matter which\r\nremains in the water is likely to be extremely small in amount. The\r\nsilting up of marshes, pools, borrow-pits, etc., is now being effected,\r\nor should be effected, in places where mosquitoes and malaria are\r\nprevalent.\r\n\r\nIn the upper or torrential part of a stream, a high dam, provided with\r\na sluice and a high-level waste weir, may be built across it. The space\r\nabove the dam becomes more or less filled with gravel, etc. This has\r\nbeen done in Switzerland (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. clxxi.). In\r\nthe U.S.A. long weirs have been built in order to stop the progress of\r\ndetritus from gold mines. Such detritus was liable to choke up rivers\r\nand damage the adjoining lands. The detritus from hill torrents can\r\nalso be reduced by afforestation of the hill sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nWhen a stream is in embankment--irrigation channels are frequently\r\nso--the bank can be set back (fig. 3), and suspended silt will then\r\ndeposit on the berms. The object of this arrangement is generally to\r\ncreate very strong banks in low ground. A similar plan can be adopted\r\nwhen the berm is only slightly below the water-level and even when it\r\nis only occasionally submerged. In this case the deposit of a small\r\nbank of silt along the edge of the berm next the stream will prevent\r\nthe access of fresh supplies of silt-bearing water to the parts further\r\naway. Gaps should be cut in the bank of silt at intervals, and cross\r\nbanks made to form “silting tanks,” as shown in fig. 4. The inlets to\r\nthe tank should be large, and the outlets small, so that the water in\r\nthe tank may have little velocity. It is not, however, correct to have\r\nthe outlet so small--unless the water contain very little silt--that\r\nthere is very little flow through the tank. The tanks will generally\r\nbe silted up most quickly by allowing a good flow through them, even\r\nthough only a small proportion of the silt in the water is deposited.\r\nRegular banks arranged to form tanks on the above principle can be made\r\nbehind the original banks of a canal in cases where the original banks\r\nwere not, for any reason, set back.\r\n\r\nWhen a channel is made in low ground and the excavation is not\r\nsufficient to make the banks, borrow-pits can be dug in the bed of the\r\nchannel. Such pits should not be long and continuous, but wide bars\r\nshould be left so that a number of short pits will result. These pits\r\nwill trap rolled material as well as suspended silt. The object in\r\nthis case is to free the water from silt and to reduce the size of the\r\nchannel and thus reduce the loss of water from percolation.\r\n\r\nOn the Indus, where it has a strong tendency to shift westwards, long\r\nearthen dams or groynes are run out from the west bank across the\r\nsandbanks. One object is to cause silt deposit, and so increase the\r\nquantity of material which the river will have to cut away, but whether\r\nthis result is achieved is doubtful. The sandbanks receive deposits in\r\nany case. A groyne may increase the deposit on its upstream side, but\r\nit cuts off the flood water from its downstream side and so reduces the\r\ndeposit there.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Arrangements at Bifurcations.=--At a bifurcation, as where a branch\r\ntakes off from a canal, it is possible to reduce the quantity of rolled\r\nmaterial entering the canal by raising its bed or constructing a\r\nweir or “sill” in its head. This arrangement may have great effect in\r\nexcluding boulders, shingle, or gravel. As regards rolled sand, it has\r\nmuch less effect than might be expected (CHAP. IV., _Art. 2_). If the\r\ncanal is reduced in width (fig. 5) there will be eddies below the bed\r\nlevel of the branch. They will stir up the sand and some of it will\r\nenter the branch. If the canal is not reduced in width, eddies will be\r\nproduced in the surface water, and they will affect the bed.\r\n\r\nThe above remarks apply also to the case of a canal taken off from a\r\nriver when there are no works in the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =A Canal with Headworks in a River.=--In the case of a canal taking\r\noff from a river and provided with complete headworks, it is possible\r\nto do a great deal more. The case of the Sirhind Canal, already\r\nreferred to (CHAP. IV., _Arts. 5_ and _6_), is a notable example. The\r\ncanal (fig. 6) is more than 200 feet wide, the full depth of water\r\n10 feet, and the full discharge about 7000 cubic feet per second. In\r\n1893 when the irrigation had developed, and it became necessary to run\r\nhigh supplies in the summer--July, August, and part of September--the\r\nincrease in the silt deposit threatened to stop the working of the\r\ncanal. In the autumn and winter, say from 25th September to 15th\r\nMarch, the water entering the canal is clear and much of the deposit\r\nwas picked up by it, but not all. In the five years 1893 to 1897\r\ninclusive, the following remedial measures were adopted. Increased\r\nuse was made of the escape at the twelfth mile. This did some good,\r\nbut there was seldom water to spare. In 1893 to 1894 the sill of the\r\nregulator was raised to 7 feet above the canal bed, and it was possible\r\nto raise it 3 feet more by means of shutters. This had little effect.\r\nThe coarsest class of sand was ·4, and the velocity of the water, even\r\nof that part of it which came up from the river bed and passed over\r\nthe sill, was over 2 feet per second, so that all sand was carried\r\nover. In 1894 to 1895 the divide wall, which had been only 59 feet\r\nlong, was lengthened to 710 feet, so as to make a pond between the\r\ndivide wall and the regulator,[8] but probably the leakage through the\r\nunder-sluices was often as much as the canal supply, and the water in\r\nthe pond was thus kept in rapid movement and full of silt. The canal\r\nwas closed in heavy floods. This did some good, but probably the canal\r\nwas often closed needlessly when the water looked muddy but contained\r\nno excessive quantity of sand. The above comments on the measures taken\r\nwere made by Mr Kennedy when chief engineer. The above measures did\r\nnot reduce the silt deposits, but the scour in the clear water season\r\nimproved, probably because higher supplies were run owing to increased\r\nirrigation. The deposit in the upper reaches of the canal, when at\r\nits maximum about the end of August of each year, was generally more\r\nthan twenty million cubic feet. From the year 1900 a better system\r\nof regulation was enforced, the under-sluices being kept closed as\r\nmuch as possible, so that there was much less movement in the pond and\r\nmuch less silt in its water. By 1904 the deposit in the canal had been\r\nreduced to three million cubic feet, and no further trouble occurred.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 20th September 1908 to 10th October 1908 the\r\nquantity of silt in the canal above Chamkour (twelfth mile) decreased\r\nfrom 19,325,800 cubic feet to 12,477,600 cubic feet. The quantity\r\nscoured away was 6,848,200 cubic feet. During this period no silt\r\nentered the canal. The quantity which passed out of the reach in\r\nquestion in suspension was 4,183,660 cubic feet, so that 2,664,540\r\ncubic feet of material must have been rolled along the bed. The rolled\r\nmaterial was 64 per cent. of the suspended material. During this period\r\nthe Daher escape, in the twelfth mile, was open, and the mean velocity\r\nin the canal just above the escape was about 4 feet per second, the\r\ndepth of water being about 10 feet. The velocity near the escape was\r\nthus greater than the critical velocity for mixed silt (CHAP. IV.,\r\n_Art. 6_), and even a long way up the canal it would be in excess of\r\nthe critical velocity. The water seems to have carried about 1/1800\r\nof its volume of silt. Whether the above proportions of rolled to\r\nsuspended matter would hold good in a fully charged stream flowing with\r\nthe critical velocity it is not easy to say.\r\n\r\nAs silt deposits in the pond, the velocity of the water in it, along\r\nthe course of the main current towards the canal, increases and\r\neventually the water begins to carry coarse sand dangerous for the\r\ncanal. In order to ascertain when this state of affairs has been\r\nreached, two methods of procedure are possible. One is to frequently\r\ntest specimens of the water in the pond along the course of the main\r\ncurrent and see when it contains more than 1/15,000 of its volume of\r\ncoarse sand. This plan would be troublesome and liable to error, and\r\nis rejected by Kennedy, who suggests that the depth and velocity of\r\nthe water in the pond be frequently observed along the course of the\r\nmain current. As soon as the velocity exceeds the critical velocity for\r\nmixed silt, it is time to close the canal and open the under-sluices\r\nand scour out the deposit from the pond. The period in which most silt\r\nis believed to have been deposited in the canal is the spring and early\r\nsummer, say from 15th March to 1st July. This is the time when the\r\nsnows are melting and the river water is clear. It can then carry more\r\nsand than in the rains--1st July to 15th September,--when it is muddy.\r\n\r\nKennedy also suggests that some under-sluices should be provided at\r\nthe far side of the river, _i.e._ at the right-hand side of the weir.\r\nIt would then be possible, by opening them, to let floods pass without\r\ninterfering with the pond.\r\n\r\nThe two spurs or groynes, shown in the plan, were constructed in 1897\r\nso as to cause the stream to flow along the face of the canal regulator\r\nand not allow deposits to accumulate there. The depth of silt deposited\r\nin a great part of the pond amounted at times to 8 or 10 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =Protection of the Bed.=--It is possible to afford direct protection\r\nfrom scour to the bed of a stream by constructing walls across it,\r\nbut unless the walls are near together the protection will not be\r\neffective. An arrangement used in some streams in Switzerland consists\r\nof tree trunks secured by short piles and resting on brushwood. But\r\nas long as the walls are not raised above the bed they cannot entirely\r\nstop scour, unless extremely close together. If raised above the bed\r\nthey form a series of weirs.\r\n\r\nThe weirs must be so designed that the depth of water in a reach\r\nbetween two weirs is great enough to reduce the velocity down to the\r\ncritical velocity, or less. The fall in the water surface at each\r\nweir being very small, the discharge over the weir can be found by\r\nconsidering it as an orifice extending up to the downstream water\r\nsurface, and the head being the fall in the surface at the weir.\r\n\r\nTo stop scour of the bed by direct protection without raising the\r\nwater-level, the bed can be paved, a plan adopted in artificial\r\nchannels with very high velocities. The paving can be of stones,\r\nbricks, or concrete blocks. The Villa system of protection, which has\r\nbeen used in Italy, France, and Spain, consists of a flexible covering\r\nlaid on the bed. Prisms of burnt clay or cement are strung on several\r\nparallel galvanized iron wires, which are attached to cross-bars so as\r\nto form a grid a few feet square. The grids are loosely connected to\r\none another at the corners, and the whole covering adjusts itself to\r\nthe irregularities of the bed (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. cxlvii.).\r\n\r\nThe special protection or paving required in connection with weirs and\r\nsuch-like works is considered in CHAP. X., _Arts. 2_ and _3_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWORKS FOR THE PROTECTION OF BANKS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.=--The protection of a length of bank from\r\nscour may be effected by spurs, which are works projecting into the\r\nstream at intervals, or by a continuous lining of the bank. A spur\r\nforms an obstruction to the stream (CHAP. IV., _Art. 1_), and when\r\nconstructed, or even partly constructed, the scour near its end may\r\nbe very severe, even though there may be little contraction of the\r\nstream as a whole. If the bed is soft a hole is scoured out. Into\r\nthis hole the spur keeps subsiding, and its construction, or even its\r\nmaintenance, may be a matter of the greatest difficulty. A high flood\r\nmay destroy it. If it does not do so, it may be because the stream has,\r\nfor some reason, ceased to attack the bank at that place. A continuous\r\nlining of the bank is not open to any objection, and is generally\r\nthe best method of protection. Spurs made of large numbers of rather\r\nsmall trees, weighted with nets filled with stones, have been used on\r\nthe great shifting rivers of the Punjab which swallowed up enormous\r\nquantities of materials. The use of spurs on such rivers has now, in\r\nmost cases, been given up. If L is the length of a spur measured at\r\nright angles to the bank, the length of bank which it protects is about\r\n7 L--3 L upstream and 4 L downstream,--but the spur has to be strongly\r\nbuilt, and its cost is, in many cases, not much less than the expense\r\nof protecting the whole bank with a continuous lining.\r\n\r\nWhatever method is adopted, a plan, large enough to show all\r\nirregularities, should always be prepared, and the line to which it is\r\nintended that the bank shall be brought marked on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nSometimes natural spurs exist as, for instance, where a tree projects\r\ninto a stream or has fallen into it, and the holes between the spurs\r\nmay be deep, so that a continuous protection would be expensive. Or\r\nthere may be trees standing in such positions that, if felled, they\r\nwill be in good places for spurs. In cases such as the above, spurs may\r\nbe suitable even in a stream with a soft channel.\r\n\r\nRegarding the use of spurs or groynes for diversion works or for\r\nreducing the width of a stream, see CHAP. VII., _Art. 1_, and CHAP.\r\nVIII., _Art. 3_.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Spurs.=--A spur may be made of--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Loose stone, which may be faced with rubble above low-water\r\n    level (fig. 7).\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Layers of fascines weighted with gravel or stones.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Earth or sand closely covered with fascines.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) A double line of stakes with fascines or brushwood laid\r\n    between them (fig. 8).\r\n\r\n    (_e_) A single line of stakes with planking or basket work on its\r\n    upstream side, or with twigs or wattle laid horizontally and passed\r\n    in and out of the stakes, as in fig. 20.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) A single tree with the thick end of the trunk on the bank and\r\n    with stakes, if necessary, to prevent the current from moving it.\r\n\r\n    (_g_) A number of small trees heaped together and weighted with\r\n    nets full of stones.\r\n\r\n    (_h_) A layer of poles and over them a layer of fascines on which\r\n    are built walls of fascine work so arranged as to form cells or\r\n    hollow rectangular spaces which become filled with silt.\r\n\r\n    (_i_) Large fascines running out into the stream and having their\r\n    inner ends staked to the bank while the outer ends float, other\r\n    fascines being added over them and projecting further into the\r\n    stream, and the whole eventually sinking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nCombinations of the above are also used, for instance, (_d_) or (_e_)\r\nmay be used for the upper portion, the foundation being (_a_) or (_c_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nInstead of running out at right angles to the bank a spur may be\r\ninclined somewhat downstream. This somewhat reduces the eddying and\r\nscour round the end. The ends of a system of spurs should be in the\r\nline which it is intended that the edge of the stream shall have\r\n(fig. 9). The tops of short spurs are usually above high flood level.\r\nSometimes spurs are made to slope downwards (fig. 10), and they then\r\ncause less disturbance of the water and less scour than if built to the\r\nform shown by the dotted line. Such spurs are sometimes combined with\r\na low wall running across the bed of the stream, the whole forming a\r\n“profile” of the cross-section to which it is intended to bring the\r\nchannel. Regarding such walls, see CHAP. V., _Art. 6_. When a spur is\r\nlong it may have small subsidiary spurs (fig. 11) to reduce the rush of\r\nwater along it; or its end may have to be protected in the same manner\r\nas the advancing end of a closure dam (CHAP. VII., _Art. 2_).\r\n\r\nThe following is a curious case of misconception of the action\r\nof spurs. In 1909 the river Indus was eroding its right bank and\r\nthreatening to destroy the town of Dera Ghazi Khan. A clump of date\r\npalms formed a promontory and resisted erosion to some extent. A\r\nsuggestion was made--by an engineer of eminence who had formerly been\r\nconsulted in the case--to the effect that the date palms be removed,\r\nthe reason given being that they caused disturbance and scour. On this\r\nprinciple spurs would have to be made not to protect a bank but to\r\ncause it to be eroded.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Continuous Lining of the Bank.=--The lining or protection of a\r\nbank may be of stone or brick pitching (figs. 12 and 13), loose stone\r\n(fig. 14), fascines (fig. 15), turfing, plantations, brushwood, or of\r\nother materials laid on the slopes. Before protecting a bank it is\r\nbest to remove irregularities and bring it to a regular line. This can\r\ngenerally be done most easily by filling in hollows, but sometimes it\r\nis done by cutting off projections. It is also necessary to make the\r\nside slope uniform. Where the slope is as shown by the dotted lines in\r\nfigs. 12 to 14, filling in can be effected, but cutting away the upper\r\npart of the slope is also feasible. Such cutting away has been proposed\r\nas a remedy in itself in cases where the steep upper part of the slope\r\nwas falling in, but it is not much of a remedy.\r\n\r\nStone pitching may rest, if boats are required to come close to the\r\nbank, on a toe wall of concrete, as in fig. 13,[9] or otherwise on a\r\nfoundation of loose stone, as in fig. 12. When concrete is used the\r\nbed is dredged to such a depth as will provide against undermining by\r\nscour. Sloping boards attached to piles are placed along the front face\r\nand the concrete is thrown in under water. The slope of stone or brick\r\npitching is usually from 2 to 1 to 1 to 1, but it may be as steep as\r\n½ to 1. The earth behind the pitching must be well rammed in layers.\r\nIn order to prevent the earth from being eaten away by the water which\r\npenetrates through the interstices of the stone or brick, a layer, 3\r\nto 6 inches thick, of gravel or ballast is placed over the earth and\r\nrammed. When loose stone is used, dredging is not necessary, but the\r\nstone is allowed to gradually sink down and more is added at the top. A\r\ncertain proportion of the stones should be of large size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nWhen fascining is used, long twigs are made into bundles and tied up\r\nat every 2 feet so as to form fascines about 4 to 6 inches thick, and\r\nthese are laid on the slopes and secured by pegs driven in at short\r\nintervals, between the fascines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the pitching or loose stone is not carried up to the top\r\nof the bank, or even up to high flood-level, and the bank above the\r\npitching is protected by turfing--the pieces of turf being placed on\r\nedge normally to the slope if very steep (fig. 14) or laid parallel to\r\nthe slope if it is not very steep--or, above ordinary water-level, by\r\nplantations of osiers or willows which obstruct the water and tend to\r\ncause silting, and whose roots bind the banks together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nAnother method of using fascines is to lay them on the slopes with\r\ntheir lengths normal to the direction of the stream. The upper end of\r\na fascine is above low water, and the lower end extends down to the\r\nbed of the stream. Sometimes large ropes made of straw, or rough mats\r\nmade of grass, are laid on the slopes and pegged down, or mattresses of\r\nfascines are laid on the slopes and weighted with stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nA deep recess in the bank (fig. 16) can be filled in, before the\r\nprotection is added, with earth well rammed. On the Adige the filling\r\nmaterial consisted (fig. 17) of faggots filled with stones, small cross\r\ndams being made at intervals, as shown by the dotted lines, to arrest\r\nflood water and cause it to deposit silt. At the back of the berm,\r\npoplar or willow slips were planted, and these grew up and their roots\r\nheld the bank together. This system succeeded well.\r\n\r\nA method of protection which is suitable when the water contains\r\nmuch silt is what is known in India as bushing. Large leafy branches\r\nof trees are cut and hung, as shown in fig. 18, by ropes to pegs.\r\nThey must be closely packed so as not to shake. At first they require\r\nlooking after, but silt rapidly deposits and the branches become fixed\r\nand no longer dependent on the ropes. If the work is carefully done,\r\nthe result is a smooth, regular, and tenacious berm, as per dotted line\r\nin the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\nAnother method, used on canals, is to make up the bank with earth and\r\nto revet it with twigs or reeds, as shown in fig. 19. The foundation\r\nmust be taken down well below bed-level, otherwise the work may slip.\r\nThis kind of work cannot be done except when the canal is dry.\r\n\r\nIf the bank consists of sand or of very sandy soil, it must in any\r\ncase have a flat side slope such as 3 to 1. If the sand is in layers\r\nalternating with firm soil, it is a good plan to dig out some of the\r\nsand and to replace it with clods of hard earth.\r\n\r\nStaking (fig. 20) may be used, the stakes being one or two feet apart\r\nfrom centre to centre, and long twigs laid horizontally being passed\r\nin and out of the stakes, or bushing filled in behind the stakes. But\r\nbushing alone is cheaper and nearly as good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nFor protecting the banks of the Indus it has been proposed (_Punjab\r\nRivers and Works_, CHAP. IV.) to use trees in exactly the same manner\r\nas bushing, the trees being grown in several rows parallel to the river\r\nso that whenever the river, by eroding its bank, comes up to the lines\r\nof trees the first row will fall in. The first row would be chained to\r\nthe second, which would take the place of the pegs used in bushing. The\r\nother rows would remain as a reserve.\r\n\r\nThe Villa system of bed protection (CHAP. V., _Art. 6_) has also been\r\nsuccessfully used for bank protection on the Scheldt, and on the\r\nBrussels-Ghent Canal, the prisms being about 10 × 10 × 4 inches, and\r\nhaving overlapping joints. The bands of prisms are placed in position\r\nby a boat, the bands unrolling over a drum. The boat is provided with\r\nan oscillating platform carrying rollers at its end. A thin layer of\r\ngravel is laid over the bank and is pressed down by the rollers before\r\nthe prisms are laid on it (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. cxxxiv., and\r\nvol. clxxv.).\r\n\r\nIn the case of the river mentioned in CHAP. XI., _Art. 3_, where\r\nextremely high velocities were met with, cylindrical rolls of\r\nwire-netting were made, each 50 feet long and 5 feet in diameter, and\r\nfilled with boulders. These rolls can be used for bank protection. The\r\nnetting was made by wires 6 inches apart, crossing each other at right\r\nangles and tied together at the crossings by short pieces of wire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\nOn ship canals a berm (fig. 21) is frequently made a few feet below the\r\nwater-level. It serves as a foundation for the pitching, which need\r\nnot usually extend down to more than 5 feet below the water-level.\r\nBelow that the wash has little or no effect on the banks. On ordinary\r\nnavigation canals a similar berm is sometimes made--one or two feet in\r\nwidth and a foot or less below the water-level--and rushes are planted\r\non it.\r\n\r\nSometimes a bank has been protected by a kind of artificial weed,\r\nconsisting of bushes or branches of trees attached to ropes. The end\r\nof the rope is fastened to the bank and the weeds float in the stream\r\nalongside the bank.\r\n\r\nTo protect a bank from ice, which exercises an uplifting force on\r\npitching, use has been made of a covering of a kind of reinforced\r\nconcrete consisting of slabs of concrete with wires embedded in it,\r\nand fastened to the bank by wires, 20 inches long, running into the\r\nbank, these wires being embedded in mortar so as to act like stakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Heavy Stone Pitching with Apron.=--On the great shifting rivers of\r\nIndia a system of bank protection is adopted, consisting of a pitched\r\nslope with an apron (fig. 22). The system is used chiefly in connection\r\nwith railway bridges or weirs, but it has been used in one instance,\r\nthat of Dera Ghazi Khan, for the protection of the bank near a town.\r\nWhen, as is usual, the flood-level is higher than the river bank, an\r\nartificial bank is made. In any case the bank is properly aligned. The\r\npitching has a slope of 2 to 1, and consists of quarried blocks of\r\nstone loosely laid, the largest blocks weighing perhaps 120 lbs. The\r\napron is laid at the time of low water on the sandbank or bed of the\r\nstream. If necessary, the ground is specially levelled for it. It is\r\nintended to slip when scour occurs. The following dimensions of the\r\napron are given by Spring (_Government of India Technical Paper_, No.\r\n153, “River Training and Control on the Guide Bank System,” 1904).\r\nThe probable maximum depth of scour can be calculated as explained\r\nin CHAP. XI., _Art. 3_. If this depth, measured from the toe of the\r\nslope pitching is D, and if T is the thickness considered necessary\r\nfor the slope pitching, then the width of the apron should be 1·5 D,\r\nand its thickness 1·25 T next the slope and 2·8 T next the river. It\r\nwill then be able to cover the scoured slope to a thickness of 1·25 T.\r\nThis thickness is made greater than T because the stone is not likely\r\nto slip quite regularly. The thickness T should, according to Spring,\r\nbe 16 inches to 52 inches, being least with a slow current and a\r\nchannel of coarse sand, and greatest with a more rapid current and fine\r\nsand; but since the sand is generally finer as the current is slower,\r\nit would appear that a thickness of about 3 feet would generally be\r\nsuitable. Under the rough stone there should be smaller pieces or\r\nbricks. Along the top of the bank there is generally a line of rails\r\nso that stone from reserve stacks, which are placed at intervals along\r\nthe bank, can be quickly brought to the spot in case the river anywhere\r\ndamages the pitched slope.\r\n\r\nFor the special protection to banks required near weirs and similar\r\nworks, see CHAP. X., _Arts. 2_ and _3_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDIVERSIONS AND CLOSURES OF STREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Diversions.=--When a stream is permanently diverted the new course\r\nis generally shorter than the old one, and the diversion is then often\r\ncalled a cut-off. The first result of a cut-off is a lowering of\r\nthe water-level upstream and a tendency to scour there, and to silt\r\ndownstream of the cut-off. Fig. 23 shows the longitudinal section of a\r\nstream after a cut-off _A B_ has been made. The bed tends to assume the\r\nposition shown by the dotted line. If both the diversion and the old\r\nchannel are to remain open, the water-level at the bifurcation will be\r\nlowered still more, and the tendency to scour in the diversion will be\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\nIf the material is soft enough to be scoured by the stream, it is often\r\npracticable to excavate a diversion to a small section and to let it\r\nenlarge itself by scour. This operation is immensely facilitated if\r\nthe old channel can be closed at the bifurcation. The question whether\r\nthe scoured material will deposit in the channel downstream of the\r\ndiversion must be taken into consideration; also the question whether\r\nthe diversion will continue to enlarge itself more than is desirable.\r\nThe velocity in the diversion will be a maximum if its section is\r\nof the “best form,” _i.e._ if its bed and sides are tangents to a\r\nsemicircle whose diameter coincides with the water surface, but this\r\nmay not (CHAP. IV., _Art. 6_) be the section which will give most\r\nscour. In order to prevent the enlargement of the diversion taking\r\nplace irregularly, the excavation can be made as shown in fig. 24,\r\nwater being admitted only to the central gullet. The side gullets\r\nshould not be quite continuous, but unexcavated portions should be left\r\nat intervals, so that if the water in scouring out the channel breaks\r\ninto the gullet, it will not be able to flow along it until it has\r\nbroken in all along.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\nIf a diversion is made, not with the object of lowering the water-level\r\nbut merely in order to shorten the channel, the increased velocity\r\ncaused by the steepened slope may be inconvenient. In this case a weir\r\nor weirs can be added (CHAP. VIII., _Art. 4_).\r\n\r\nIf the water contains sufficient silt to enable the abandoned loop to\r\nbe silted up within a reasonable time, it may be desirable to do this.\r\nThe silting up may, for instance, increase the value of the land. The\r\nloop should be closed at its upper end. Water entering the lower end\r\nwill cause a deposit there. When the lower end is well obstructed by\r\nsilt, the upper end should be opened.\r\n\r\nThe set of the stream, due, for instance, to a bend at the point\r\nwhere a diversion takes off has very little to do with the quantity\r\nof water which goes down the diversion. The only effect of the set of\r\nthe stream is a slight rise of the water-level as compared with the\r\nopposite bank. Similarly, the angle at which the diversion takes off\r\nis only of importance in giving, in some cases, a velocity of approach\r\nwhose effect is generally small. The distribution of the water between\r\nthe diversion and the old channel really depends on their relative\r\ndischarging capacities. If the required quantity of water does not flow\r\ndown a diversion it can be dredged.\r\n\r\nSometimes a long spur is run out to send the water towards the off-take\r\nof a diversion. The effect of this is very small--it merely causes a\r\nset of the stream,--unless its length is so great that it amounts to\r\nsomething like a closure dam. It is sometimes said that it is easier\r\nto lead a river than to drive it. This remark is probably based on the\r\nfact that spurs, such as those under consideration, generally produce\r\nlittle effect, whereas the excavation of a diversion or the deepening\r\nof a branch by dredging it, is more likely to produce some result.\r\nThere is, however, no certainty about this. Sometimes too much is\r\nexpected of such channels. Calculations are not always made as to the\r\nscouring power of the stream, nor is account always taken of the fact\r\nthat as the cut scours its gradient flattens.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Closure of a Flowing Stream.=--The closure of a flowing stream by\r\nmeans of a dam is usually attended with some difficulty and sometimes\r\nwith enormous difficulty. There may be little trouble in running out\r\ndams from both banks for a certain distance, but as soon as the gap\r\nbetween the dams becomes much less than the original width of the\r\nstream, the water on the upstream side is headed up and there is a rush\r\nof water through the gap, which tends to deeply scour the bed and to\r\nundermine the dams. The smaller the gap becomes the greater is the rush\r\nand scour.\r\n\r\nThe closure is most easily effected at or near to the place where the\r\nstream bifurcates from another. Then, as the gap decreases in width,\r\nsome of the water is driven down the other stream and it does not rise\r\nso much. Eventually all the water goes down the other stream, and\r\nthe total rise is only so much as will enable this other stream to\r\ncarry the increased discharge. If the closure is not effected near a\r\nbifurcation, the rise of the water will go on even after the closure is\r\ncompleted, and it will not cease, unless the water escapes or breaks\r\nout somewhere, until it has risen to the same level as that to which it\r\nwould have risen if the closure had been at the bifurcation, or perhaps\r\nnot quite to the same level, since there may still be a slight slope in\r\nthe water surface and a small discharge which percolates through the\r\ndam. Sometimes in such a case it is possible to arrange for temporary\r\nescapes or bifurcations, which will be shallow and therefore easily\r\nclosed, after the main closure has been completed.\r\n\r\nA closure is, of course, far more easily effected where the bed is hard\r\nthan where it is soft. Very often it is best to close temporarily at\r\nsuch a place or near a bifurcation, even if the permanent dam has to be\r\nelsewhere, and then to construct the permanent dam in the dry channel,\r\nor in the still water, and remove the temporary one or cut a gap in it.\r\n\r\nGenerally the best method to adopt in a closure is to cover the bed\r\nof the channel beforehand--unless it is already hard enough--with a\r\nmattress or floor, such that it cannot be scoured as the gap closes.\r\nA floor may consist of a number of stones or sandbags dropped in from\r\nboats or by any suitable means, and placed with care so that there\r\nshall not be gaps or mounds. Sandbags should be carefully sewn up. A\r\nmattress may be made of fascines laid side by side and tied together,\r\nfloated into position, weighted and sunk. Even a carpet made of matting\r\nor cloth and suitably weighted has sufficed in some cases. If the\r\nscour is likely to be such that stones or sandbags will be carried\r\naway, the stones may be placed in nets, baskets, or crates. Sandbags\r\nmay also be placed in nets. Probably the long rolls of wire-netting\r\nfilled with stones, described in CHAP. VI., _Art. 3_, would be better\r\nthan anything, and the diameter could be reduced somewhat. The floor or\r\nmattress need not usually extend right across the stream. It must cover\r\na width much greater than--perhaps twice as great as--the width of the\r\ngap is likely to be when scour begins. Its length, measured parallel\r\nto the direction of the stream, must be such that severe eddies in\r\nthe contracted stream will have ceased before the stream reaches its\r\ndownstream edge. It need not extend to any considerable distance\r\nupstream of the line of the dam.\r\n\r\nThe dams when started from the banks can generally be of simple earth\r\nor gravel, or loose stones, but before they have advanced far they\r\nwill probably require protection at the ends by stones, or by staking\r\nand brushwood, or by fascines. As soon as the dams have advanced well\r\nonto the mattress and their ends have been well protected, it is best\r\nto cease contracting the stream from the sides and to contract it\r\nfrom the bottom by laying a number of sandbags across the gap so as to\r\nform a submerged weir. In this way the rush of water is spread over\r\na considerable width of the stream. The weir is then raised until it\r\ncomes up above water. Leakage can be stopped by throwing in earth, or\r\ngravel, or bundles of grass on the upstream side. Sometimes it is best\r\nto construct the mattress over the whole width of the stream, and to\r\neffect the closure entirely by a weir, carrying each layer right across\r\nbefore adding another. The banks of the stream, if not hard, can be\r\nprotected by sandbags, stones, staking or fascining.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of failures of attempts to close flowing streams is\r\nneglect to provide a proper floor or mattress. The stones or other\r\nmaterials may be of insufficient weight or not closely laid, or the\r\nextent of the floor may be insufficient. In a soft channel and deep\r\nwater loose stones in almost any quantity may fail unless a mattress of\r\nfascines is laid under them. Another cause of failure is running short\r\nof materials, such as sandbags. Allowance should be made for every\r\ncontingency, including making good any failure of parts of the work.\r\nEnormous sums of money have been wasted, and vast inconvenience, loss\r\nand trouble incurred, in futile attempts to close breaches in banks, or\r\ngaps in dams.\r\n\r\nSometimes the gap is closed by sinking a barge loaded with stones, or\r\nby sinking a “cradle” or large mattress made of fascines, taken out to\r\nthe site by four boats, one supporting each corner, and then loaded\r\nwith stones and sunk. Another method is to run out a floating mattress\r\nof fascines from one side of the gap to the middle and sink it, then\r\nto proceed similarly on the other side, and so on.\r\n\r\nAn excellent plan, when it can be adopted, is to have more than one\r\nline of operations, so that the heading up of the water is divided\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nIn India closures of streams having depths of 6 or 8 feet are effected\r\nby means of rough trestles made from trunks of small trees and placed\r\nat intervals in the stream like bridge piers, one leg of the trestle\r\ninclined upstream and one downstream. Each pair of adjacent trestles\r\nis connected by a number of rough, horizontal poles. Against these are\r\nplaced bundles of brushwood. Earth is at the same time collected and\r\nis rapidly added at the last. The chief danger is the undermining of\r\nthe bed by scour. This is prevented by driving in stakes and placing\r\nbrushwood against them. Closures of small channels or of breaches in\r\nthe banks of canals are effected by means of staking and brushwood.\r\nWhere dangerous breaches are liable to occur, it is a good plan to have\r\na barge, fitted up with a small pile-driver and carrying a supply of\r\nsheet piles, ready at a convenient spot.\r\n\r\nHurdle dykes, first used on the Mississippi, were employed on the\r\nIndus in 1902 to close partially the main channel of the river.\r\nThere were to be three dykes, each dyke consisting of three lines of\r\nvery long piles--some were 60 feet long,--driven into the bed of the\r\nstream, which was to be protected with mattresses made of fascines and\r\nextending right across it, with their heads above flood-level. The\r\nidea was not to wholly stop the flow of the water, but to obstruct it\r\nso much that silt would deposit, the channel become choked up, and the\r\nwater find a course down another channel. The work was begun in March\r\n1902, and was in progress in May of the same year when an unusually\r\nearly flood put a stop to it. The dykes had at this time advanced\r\nconsiderable distances from the right bank of the stream, but none\r\nhad been completed. Two dykes out of the three were for the most part\r\ncarried away. The river, however, took a new course, starting from a\r\npoint far upstream, the western channel became a creek, and the remains\r\nof the dykes were soon embedded in silt.\r\n\r\nIn any case in which the provision of a proper mattress has been\r\nomitted, or when the mattress has been destroyed, or when a breach has\r\noccurred in an embankment, whenever, in short, it is evident that the\r\ngap cannot be closed until some other escape for the water is provided,\r\nit may be possible to provide such an escape by cutting partly through\r\nthe dam or embankment on the downstream side at another place, and\r\nthoroughly protecting the place and extending the protection downstream\r\nand away from the dam or embankment. The water can then be let in, and\r\nthe closure of the old gap attempted. If a closure is effected, the\r\nprotected gap can then be closed. Sometimes it may be desirable to make\r\nsuch a protected gap beforehand and with deliberation.\r\n\r\nDams for closing streams which are dry can be made similarly to flood\r\nembankments (CHAP. XII., _Art. 7_). Sand does very well, provided it is\r\nprotected by a covering of clay or by fascining.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Instances of Closures of Streams.=--In 1904 the Colorado River\r\nbroke into the Salton Sink--a valley covering 4000 square miles.\r\nUnsuccessful attempts were made to close the stream by two rows of\r\npiles with willows and sandbags between them, by a gate 200 feet long,\r\nsupported on 500 piles, and by twelve gates each 12 feet wide. A\r\n“rock-fill” dam was then constructed on a mattress 100 feet wide and\r\n1·5 feet thick. The river, which was 600 feet wide, broke through, but\r\nwas stopped by the construction of three parallel rock-fill dams in the\r\ngap (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. clxxi.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nAt the site of the railway bridge over the river Tista in Bengal, it\r\nwas necessary to close the main stream (fig. 25), which flowed at the\r\nleft side of the channel, while the bridge had been built at the right.\r\nThe bed was of sand, width 500 feet, depth 6 feet, and discharge 3700\r\ncubic feet per second. The first attempt to close the stream was made\r\nat M N, a floor of stone 200 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 2 feet\r\nthick, being laid in the middle of the stream, and dams of earth,\r\nsandbags, and stones being run out from each bank. As the gap decreased\r\nin width the bed was torn up and the work failed. The heading up was 3\r\nfeet 9 inches. It was recognised later that the site should have been\r\nat the bifurcation higher up, and that the stone floor should have been\r\nlaid on a mattress.\r\n\r\nIn the next working season the dams C D and E F G were made. The dam C\r\nD was of earth. Two walls, each consisting of a double line of bamboos\r\nwith the spaces between the lines filled with bundles of grass weighted\r\nwith earth, were run out 50 feet in advance of the earthwork near the\r\nlines of the toes of the slopes. Along the line of the upper wall a\r\nmattress of broken bricks 10 feet in width, and 1 foot thick, was laid,\r\nand was kept 50 feet in advance of the wall. A total length of 1000\r\nfeet of embankment was made in five months and pitched on its upstream\r\nside. The end was strongly protected by a mass of stone. The embankment\r\nF G was of earth. The dam E F consisted of three lines of piles driven\r\n10 feet into the bed. A mattress weighted with stones extended for 20\r\nfeet upstream of the dam and 40 feet downstream. A gap of 150 feet was\r\nleft at D E, and was not protected by a floor of any kind. A channel,\r\nparallel to F G and extending to K, had been dug to a width of 200\r\nfeet. During the floods the heading up at D E was about 2·5 feet, and\r\nthe water was 30 feet deep. The line E F was greatly damaged and was\r\nrepaired. The cut F G K gradually enlarged, and by the end of the\r\nfloods more water was going down it than down the main stream. The gap\r\nD E was finally closed by means of a line of bamboos and grass, the\r\nbed being protected by a carpet, 100 × 50 feet, made of common cloth\r\nweighted with sandbags. The success of the operations turned on the\r\nscouring out of the cut F G K. It is remarkable that the gap D E did\r\nnot become wholly unmanageable in the floods (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._,\r\nvol. cl.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING AND CANALISATION OF RIVERS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.=--When a stream is trained or regularised it\r\nis generally made narrower, but sometimes narrow places have to be\r\nwidened. Deepening has also very frequently to be effected. The object\r\nof training is generally the improvement of navigation, but it may be\r\nthe prevention of silt deposit. Some natural arms of rivers which form\r\nthe head reaches of canals in the Punjab are wide and tortuous, and\r\nthey are sometimes trained. Training often includes straightening or\r\nthe cutting-off of bends, as to which reference may be made to CHAP.\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Dredging and Excavating.=--When a flowing stream is to be deepened,\r\nthe work is usually done by dredgers. Dredgers can remove mud, sand,\r\nclay, boulders, or broken pieces of rock. The “bucket ladder” dredger\r\nis the commonest type. The “dipper” dredger is another. Both these\r\ncan work in depths of water ranging up to 35 feet. The “grab bucket”\r\ndredger can work up to any depth and in a confined space. The “suction\r\ndredger” drawls up mud or sand mixed with water. A dredger may be\r\nfitted with a hopper or movable bottom, by means of which it can\r\ndischarge the dredged material--this, however, involves cessation\r\nof work while the dredger makes a journey to the place where the\r\nmaterial is to be deposited--or it can discharge into hopper barges or\r\ndirectly on to the shore by means of long shoots. For small works in\r\ncomparatively shallow water the “bag and spoon” dredger, worked by two\r\nmen, can be used.\r\n\r\nWhen rock has to be removed under water it is blasted or broken up by\r\nthe blows of heavy rams provided with steel-pointed cutters.\r\n\r\nIn widening a channel the excavation can be carried down in the\r\nordinary way to below the water-level, a narrow piece of earth, like a\r\nwall, being left to keep the water out. If the channel cannot be laid\r\ndry, the work can be finished by dredging.\r\n\r\nRegarding methods by which the stream is itself made to deepen or widen\r\nits channel, reference may be made to CHAP. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Reduction of Width.=--If a channel which is to be narrowed is\r\nnot a wide one, the reduction in width can be effected by any of the\r\nprocesses described under bank protection (CHAP. VI.). But in a wide\r\nchannel, reduction of the width by any direct process is generally\r\nimpracticable. The expense would generally be prohibitive. Earth, if\r\nfilled in, is liable to be washed away unless protected all along.\r\nReduction in the width of a large channel is nearly always effected\r\neither by groynes (fig. 26) or by training walls (fig. 27). Spurs or\r\nshort groynes for bank protection have been already described (CHAP.\r\nVI., _Art. 2_). Groynes for narrowing streams are made in the same way\r\nand of the same materials, but are longer. They are at right angles\r\nto the stream or nearly so. Groynes in the river Sutlej have been\r\nmentioned in CHAP. V., _Art. 5_, and are shown in fig. 6, p. 55.\r\nWhether groynes or training walls are used, the object is to confine\r\nthe stream to a definite zone and to silt up the spaces at the sides.\r\nThese spaces when partly silted can be planted with osiers or with\r\nanything which will grow when partly submerged, and this will assist in\r\ncompleting the silting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nA training wall can be made of any of the materials used for groynes.\r\nIn order to silt up the spaces between each wall and the adjacent bank\r\nof the stream, other walls are run at intervals across them. Usually\r\nthe training walls and cross walls are carried up only to ordinary\r\nwater-level, sometimes only to low-water level. Floods can thus spread\r\nout and submerge the walls and deposit silt. If the walls are carried\r\nup too high it may be necessary, in order to give room for floods,\r\nto space them too far apart, and this, as will be seen below, is\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nThe difference between training walls and groynes is one of degree\r\nrather than one of kind. The material most commonly used is, in\r\neither case, loose stone--with pitching, if desired, above low-water\r\nlevel,--but it may be wattled stakes. If the water of the stream\r\ncontains silt at all stages of the supply, gaps can be left in training\r\nwalls so that silt deposit may occur at all times and not only in\r\nfloods. If the walls are of wattled stakes, water will pass through\r\nthem, and it may not be necessary to leave any gaps. Groynes are\r\nfrequently made with =T=-heads (fig. 26), and they are thus equivalent\r\nto training walls with long gaps in them. The edge of the narrowed\r\nchannel usually forms somewhat as shown in the figure. If the groynes\r\nare placed so near together as to give a regular channel, the cost is\r\nnot likely to be much less than that of training walls.\r\n\r\nThe alignment of training walls or groynes should be such as will give\r\nthe best channel consistent with economy in cost. The best channel is\r\ngenerally that which is most free from sharp bends. It is assumed for\r\nthe present that no cuts or diversions of such lengths as to materially\r\nalter the gradient are to be made, but that a certain amount of choice\r\nof alignment is afforded by the reduced width of the trained channel\r\nand by small diversions or easings of bends. It is sometimes said that\r\nstraight reaches are objectionable because the stream will tend to\r\nwander from side to side and cause shoals, whereas in a bend there will\r\nbe no such tendency. The difficulty as to shoaling will be greatest at\r\nlow water, but it is likely to be serious only when the width between\r\nthe training walls is too great. If the width cannot be reduced to such\r\nan extent as to do away with the trouble, it may be better to adopt a\r\ncurved course. The width between the training walls should generally be\r\nthe same throughout, whether the reaches are straight or curved, but\r\nin view of the preceding remarks it may be desirable, where a reach\r\ncannot be otherwise than straight and where shoaling is feared, to give\r\nthe straight portion a reduced width with of course a greater depth,\r\nand similarly to reduce the width at reverse changes of curvature. In\r\ncurves which are at all sharp the curvature should be rather sharper in\r\nthe middle of the curve than at the ends (CHAP. IV., _Art. 8_).\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Alteration of Depth or Water-Level.=--When the width of a stream\r\nis altered, the depth of water--the gradient being supposed to be\r\nunchanged--must alter in the opposite manner. A narrowing of the\r\nchannel by training necessitates an increase in the depth of water,\r\nand the same remark applies if an arm of the stream is closed. The\r\nincrease in depth may be effected either by raising the water-level or\r\nby lowering the bed--as may be convenient--or both. If the bed is to be\r\nlowered and is of hard clay, it may be necessary to dredge it and, when\r\nthis has been done, training may be unnecessary. If the bed is of soft\r\nmud, a dredged channel is likely to fill up again, and training alone\r\nwill be the method to adopt. If the bed is moderately hard, say compact\r\nsand, it may be suitable to train the channel first and then to dredge\r\nif necessary. In any case, shoals of hard material may have to be\r\ndredged or rocks, whether these form shoals or lateral obstructions,\r\nto be blasted or otherwise broken up (_Art. 2_). In cases where it\r\nis desired to raise the water-level without any lowering of the bed,\r\ntraining is of course necessary. In any case in which the bed is likely\r\nto scour to a lower level than is desired, or if the bed is to be\r\nraised, the measures described in CHAP. V., _Art. 6_, may be adopted,\r\nbut they are hardly likely to be suitable and satisfactory in all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Training and Canalising.=--The steps so far described, together\r\nwith any of those described in CHAPS. V. and VI., exhaust the list\r\nof what can be done so long as only the cross-section of a stream is\r\ndealt with. This is often called the “regulation” of a stream, though\r\n“training” is a more satisfactory term.[10]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nA mere alteration of the cross-section of a stream will not always\r\nafford a solution of the problem to be solved. Frequently a change\r\nof gradient is required. The gradient can be steepened by means of\r\nstraightenings, or flattened by introducing weirs, or perhaps by\r\nadopting a course somewhat more circuitous than was intended. This\r\nextended scope of operations is known as canalising in the case of a\r\nriver, and remodelling in the case of a canal.\r\n\r\nSuppose that it is desired to alter the cross-section of a stream,\r\nat ordinary water-level, so as to reduce the width and increase the\r\ndepth (fig. 28). If the mean depth is doubled, the new width will be\r\nabout equal to 1/(3·2) of the old width (_Hydraulics_, CHAP. VI.,\r\n_Art. 2_). If this gives too narrow a channel, it may be desirable to\r\nflatten the gradient. If it gives too wide a channel, the gradient can\r\nbe steepened or a greater depth adopted. While the width and depth of\r\nthe stream will be fixed so as to be suitable for the navigation, the\r\nratio of depth to velocity should be so arranged, if this is possible,\r\nas to minimise trouble connected with silting or scour (CHAP. IV.,\r\n_Art. 6_). A remodelled channel is, in short, designed in exactly the\r\nsame way as a new channel. The depth of water exercises the greatest\r\neffect on the discharge, and the gradient the least. The weak point in\r\na scheme which includes weirs is the difficulty of dealing with floods.\r\nA scheme perfect in all other respects may be vitiated because of the\r\nobstruction, caused by weirs, to the passage of floods. The difficulty\r\nis got over by means of movable weirs. The whole subject of weirs is\r\ndealt with in CHAP. X.\r\n\r\nTraining or canalising should not be effected in any reach of a\r\nstream without regard to other reaches. A mere local lowering of the\r\nwater-level by dredging may accentuate the effect of a shoal at the\r\nupper end of the reach.\r\n\r\nWhen the water-level is raised by a weir or by narrowing the\r\nchannel--though in the latter case the raising may not be permanent--it\r\nis generally best to commence the work from the upstream end. The\r\nraising of the water-level will then not interfere with the execution\r\nof the rest of the work. But in a case of widening, where the\r\nwater-level upstream of the work is lowered, the work can conveniently\r\nbe begun at the downstream end, and the remark applies also to a case\r\nof straightening, provided that the new channel is not so small that\r\nit at first causes no lowering. In any case in which there is a doubt\r\nwhether the whole of the scheme will be carried out, the reach to be\r\ndealt with first can be decided on according to circumstances. There is\r\nno general reason for selecting an upstream or downstream reach, except\r\nthat any raising or lowering of the water-level will extend upstream of\r\nthe reach and not downstream of it (CHAP. I., _Art. 4_).\r\n\r\nTraining walls and groynes, if made with stakes or fascines or any\r\nmaterials except stone, require careful watching and maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCANALS AND CONDUITS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Banks.=--All banks which have to hold up water should be carefully\r\nmade. The earth should be deposited in layers and all clods broken\r\nup. In high banks the layers should be moistened and rammed. The\r\ndotted lines in fig. 29 show two possible courses of percolation\r\nwater. The vertical height--from the water-level to the ground outside\r\nthe bank,--divided by the length of the line of percolation is the\r\nhydraulic gradient, as in the case of a pipe, and this gradient is\r\nmore or less a measure of the tendency to leakage. A bank which has\r\nwater constantly against it nearly always becomes almost water-tight in\r\ntime. The time is less or greater according as the soil is better, and\r\naccording to the amount of care with which the bank is made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe side slopes of banks vary with the soil. Generally they are 1½ to\r\n1, but they are sometimes 2 to 1 or even 3 to 1 if the soil is bad or\r\nsandy, or if great precautions against breaches are to be taken.\r\n\r\nLeakage can sometimes be stopped by throwing chaff or other finely\r\ndivided substances into the water at the site of the leak. In other\r\ncases it is necessary to dig up part of the bank, find the channel\r\nby which the water is escaping, and fill it up by adding earth and\r\nramming. On some navigable canals in France it was at one time the\r\ncustom to lay the reach dry, when a bad leak occurred, and to dig away\r\nthe bank and lay slabs of concrete or puddle over the place. This plan\r\nwas abandoned, and instead of it sheet piles are driven in. They are\r\nthen withdrawn one at a time and, if any leakage occurs, the space is\r\nfilled with concrete.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of a bank should depend to some extent on the head of\r\nwater against it and on the volume of the stream whose water it holds\r\nup. A breach is obviously more serious the greater the volume of the\r\nescaping water. This volume depends on the size of the stream and on\r\nits velocity. In navigation canals in England the bank on the side\r\nopposite the towing-path is usually 4 to 6 feet wide and 1½ feet above\r\nthe water. In irrigation canals in India the bank of a very large canal\r\nis 2 feet above the water and 20 feet wide, while that of a small canal\r\nwith 6 feet of water is 8 or 10 feet wide and 1½ feet above the water,\r\nand that of a small distributary channel with 3 feet of water is 4 feet\r\nwide and 1 foot above the water. The soil is often poor.\r\n\r\nFurther remarks, which apply to banks of special height or special\r\nimportance, are given under Embankments (CHAP. XII., _Art. 6_).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Navigation Canals.=--A navigation canal is sometimes all on one\r\nlevel, but generally different reaches are at different levels, the\r\nchange being made by means of locks. A “lateral” canal--the most common\r\nkind--runs along a river valley more or less parallel to the river. It\r\nis frequently cheaper to construct such a canal than to canalise the\r\nriver. A “summit” canal crosses over a ridge and connects two valleys.\r\nA navigation canal requires a supply of water to make good the losses\r\nwhich occur by lockage, leakage, or absorption and evaporation. A canal\r\nmay be of any size, according to the size of the boats which are to be\r\nused. There is always room, except in short reaches where the expense\r\nof construction has to be kept down, for two boats to pass one another.\r\n\r\nA lateral canal obtains water from the river or from the small\r\naffluents which it crosses. For a summit canal it may be necessary to\r\nprovide storage reservoirs. The canal crosses the ridge where it is\r\nlow, and the reservoirs are made on higher ground. Reservoirs may be\r\nrequired also for other canals to hold water for use in dry seasons or\r\nin order to fill the canal quickly when laid dry for repairs.\r\n\r\nIn tropical countries weeds grow profusely in canals which have still\r\nor nearly still water. Traffic tends to keep them down, but they have\r\nto be cleared periodically.\r\n\r\nIn designing a barge canal the chief considerations generally are that\r\nit shall not be in such low ground or so near a river as to be liable\r\nto damage by floods, that it shall not traverse very permeable soil or\r\ngravel--this is often found near a river,--that the material excavated\r\nshall be as nearly as possible equal to that required, at the same\r\nplace, for embankment, and that as far as possible high embankments,\r\nwhich are very expensive to construct and are more or less a source of\r\ndanger, shall be avoided. The side slopes of the banks of a navigation\r\ncanal depend on the nature of the soil. They are generally 1½ to 1, but\r\nthe inner slope may be 2 to 1. The banks are generally 1½ or 2 feet\r\nabove the water-level, the width of the bank on the towing-path side\r\nranging from 8 to 16 feet, but being generally 12 feet and the width\r\nof the other bank 4 to 6 feet. The width of a canal is made sufficient\r\nfor two boats to pass, and the depth is 1½ to 2 feet greater than the\r\ndraught of the boats used. In some cases the banks are protected by\r\npitching for short lengths, but generally they are merely turfed. The\r\nsides near the water surface wear away, so that the side slope becomes\r\nsteeper in the upper part and flatter in the lower part. The resistance\r\nof a boat to traction in a canal is given by the formula\r\n\r\n    R = _r_(8·46)/(2 + (A/_a_)),\r\n\r\nwhere _r_ is the resistance in a large body of water and A and _a_ are\r\nthe areas of the cross-sections of the canal and of the immersed part\r\nof the boat. When A is six times _a_, R is only 6 per cent. more than\r\n_r_. In practice A is never less than six times _a_.\r\n\r\nRegarding methods of protecting banks, see CHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nA ship canal is a barge canal on a large scale. The speed of ships has\r\nto be strictly limited to avoid damage to the banks.\r\n\r\nThe Manchester Ship Canal takes in the waters of the Irwell and the\r\nMersey, and conveys them for several miles. It is thus a canalised\r\nriver for part of its course. Below that it is a tidal stream, the tide\r\nbeing admitted at its lower end where it joins the estuary of the\r\nMersey, and passing out higher up where it leaves the estuary after\r\nskirting it. This circulation of water is beneficial to the estuary.\r\n\r\nThe Panama Canal might have been constructed at one level, but the cost\r\nof this, and the time occupied, would have been double that of making\r\nit a summit canal. The water of the river Chagres is to be impounded to\r\nform a lake of great extent that will not only supply water for lockage\r\nbut will itself form part of the high-level reach of the canal, and\r\nships will be able to traverse it at greater speed than in the rest of\r\nthe canal.\r\n\r\nSome Indian irrigation canals have been constructed so as to be\r\nnavigable. The increase in cost has usually been enormously in excess\r\nof any resulting benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Locks.=--An ordinary lock is shown in fig. 29A. The space above the\r\nhead gates is called the “head bay,” and that below the tail gates the\r\n“tail bay.” The floor of the lock is often an inverted arch. Sometimes\r\nthe floor is of cast-iron. The “lift wall” is generally a horizontal\r\narch. The gates when closed press at their lower ends against the\r\n“mitre sills”; and the vertical “mitre posts” at the edges of the\r\ngates meet and are pressed together. The gate, in opening and closing,\r\nrevolves above the cylindrical “heel post”--which stands in the “hollow\r\nquoin” of the lock wall--and when fully open is contained in the “gate\r\nrecess.”\r\n\r\nA lock is always strongly built, of masonry or concrete. The walls have\r\nto withstand the earth pressure when the lock is laid dry for repairs.\r\nThe floor has to withstand the scouring action from the sluices.\r\nRegarding the upward pressure of the water when the lock is empty,\r\nsee CHAP. X., _Art. 3_. The lift or difference in the water-levels of\r\nthe two reaches of a barge canal is generally from 4 to 9 feet, but\r\noccasionally it is much more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29A.]\r\n\r\nThe gates of small locks are generally of wood and are counterbalanced.\r\nThose of large locks are of wood or steel, and the weight is generally\r\ntaken by rollers. Ordinary wood should not be used if the _Teredo\r\nnavalis_ exists in the waters. An iron gate, if enclosed on all sides\r\nby plating, is buoyant, and the rollers and anchor straps which hold\r\nthe upper ends of the heel posts are thus relieved of much weight. The\r\ngates of the Panama Canal locks are 110 feet long and 7 feet thick, and\r\nthe height ranges from 48 feet to 82 feet.\r\n\r\nThe sluices for filling and emptying a lock are placed in the gates or\r\nin the walls. The gates and sluices are generally worked by hydraulic\r\npower or by electricity.\r\n\r\nLocks are frequently arranged in flights. There are, in a few\r\ninstances, 20 to 30 locks in a flight, the total lift being 150 to 200\r\nfeet. By this means the number of gates is reduced, the tail gates of\r\none lock being the head gates of the rest, and there is a saving in\r\nlabour in working the locks.\r\n\r\nLet L be the volume of water contained in a lock between the levels of\r\nthe upper and lower reaches, and let B be the submerged volume of a\r\nboat. The “lockage” or volume of water withdrawn from the upper reach\r\nof the canal is shown in the following statement:--\r\n\r\n  +---------+---------+------------+-----------+---------+-------------------------+\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |        Lockage.         |\r\n  |Reference| Number  | Direction  |  Lock or  | Lock or +-----------+-------------+\r\n  | Number  |of Boats.| of Travel. |   Locks   | Locks   |  Single   |  Flight of  |\r\n  | of Case.|         |            |   Found.  | Left.   |   Lock.   | _m_  Locks. |\r\n  +---------+---------+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------------+\r\n  |    1    |    1    |   Down.    |  Empty.   |  Empty. |   L - B   |    L - B    |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |    2    |    1    |     ”      |   Full.   |    ”    |     - B   |      - B    |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |    3    |    1    |    Up.     |  Empty.   |  Full.  |   L + B   |   _m_L + B  |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |    4    |    1    |     ”      |   Full.   |    ”    |   L + B   |    L + B    |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |    5    |  2_n_   |  Up and    | Going     |  Going  |  _n_L     |    _mn_L    |\r\n  |         |         |   down     |down, full.|  down,  |           |             |\r\n  |         |         |alternately.| Going up, |  empty. |           |             |\r\n  |         |         |            |   empty.  |Going up,|           |             |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |  full.  |           |             |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |    6    |   _n_   |   Down.    |   Empty.  |  Empty. | _n_L-_n_B | _n_L - _n_B |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |    7    |   _n_   |     ”      |   Full.   |    ”    |  (_n_-1)L | (_n_ - 1)L  |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |  - _n_B   |   -_n_B     |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |    8    |   _n_   |    Up.     |   Empty.  |  Full.  | _n_L+_n_B |(_m_+_n_-1)L |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |     +_n_B   |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |    9    |   _n_   |     ”      |   Full.   |    ”    | _n_L+_n_B | _n_L + _n_B |\r\n  |         |         |            |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |   10    | { _n_   |   Down.}   |           |         |           |             |\r\n  |         | { _n_   |   Up.  }   |     ”     |    ”    | (2_n_-1)L |(_m_+2_n_-2)L|\r\n  +---------+---------+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------------+\r\n\r\nIn the case of a single lock, if two boats are to pass through, one\r\ndescending and one ascending (cases 2 and 3), the descending boat would\r\nbe passed through first if the lock were full, and the ascending boat\r\nfirst if empty; in either case, the total lockage is L, or L/2 for\r\neach boat. This also appears from case 5. Cases 6 to 10 show that if\r\na long train of boats descends, even though the lock is full for the\r\nfirst boat or if a long train ascends even the lock is empty for the\r\nfirst boat, the total lockage is nearly L per boat. Thus in a single\r\nlock, boats should pass up and down alternately so far as this may be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a flight of _m_ locks, a single boat in descending uses\r\nno more water than if there were only one lock, the same water passing\r\nfrom lock to lock, but in ascending it uses more. In the case of a\r\nnumber (2_n_) of boats going up and down alternately (case 5), the\r\nlockage is _m_ _n_ L, the lockage per lock per boat being L/2, but in\r\nthe case of a long train of boats descending followed by an equal train\r\nascending (cases 7 and 8), the lockage is less. If _n_ is supposed to\r\nbe equal to _m_, the average lockage per boat is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _m_       =   1     2    3      4      5      6      Infinity\r\n\r\n  Lockage   =   L/2   L   7L/6   5L/4   13L/10  4L/3    3L/2\r\n  per boat\r\n\r\nThus in a case where _n_ and _m_ are very large, the average lockage\r\nper boat, when the boats pass up and down in trains, is to the lockage\r\nper boat, when the single boats pass up and down alternately through\r\n_m_ single locks all at different places, as 3 is to _m_. The reason\r\nfor the difference, which may appear puzzling, is that when the locks\r\nare at different places they are worked independently of one another.\r\n\r\nSometimes a lock is provided with intermediate gates which provide a\r\nshort lock for short vessels. In the Manchester Ship Canal, alongside\r\neach lock there is another of smaller size to be used for small vessels\r\nand thus save lockage. At the Eastham lock, where the Manchester Ship\r\nCanal descends into the estuary of the Mersey, there is, below the tail\r\ngates, an extra pair of gates opening towards the estuary, so that the\r\nlock can be worked when the water of the estuary is higher than that\r\nin the canal. Water can be economised by means of a “side-pond,” into\r\nwhich the upper portion of the water from a lock can be discharged and\r\nutilised again when the lock has to be filled. If two locks are built\r\nside by side, each acts as a side-pond to the other. Two flights of\r\nlocks can be built side by side.\r\n\r\nSometimes instead of a lock there is an inclined plane, up or down\r\nwhich are drawn on rails caissons containing water in which the boats\r\nfloat. The rails extend below the water-levels of the two reaches, and\r\nthe caissons can thus be run under the boats. “Lifts” have also been\r\nconstructed by which the boats can be lifted bodily and swung over from\r\none reach to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Other Artificial Channels.=--The method of calculating the\r\ndischarges of channels in which water is to flow is a question of\r\nhydraulics. The principles and rules to be followed, in the design of\r\nearthen channels, have been stated in CHAP. IV., _Art. 6_, and in CHAP.\r\nVIII., _Art. 5_. The design of banks has been dealt with in _Art. 1_\r\nof this Chapter. For conveying water for the supply of towns, or for\r\nother purposes, masonry conduits are often used. A usual form is shown\r\nin fig. 30. The curving of the profile of the cross-section gives an\r\nincreased sectional area and hydraulic radius, and hence an increased\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWEIRS AND SLUICES\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.=--Every structure which interferes at all\r\nwith a stream causes an abrupt change in the stream (CHAP. IV., _Art.\r\n1_). At an abrupt change there are always eddies, and these have a\r\npeculiar scouring effect. This effect is greatest where the velocity\r\nof the stream is abruptly reduced as where, for instance, after being\r\ncontracted by an obstruction, it expands again or where it falls over\r\na weir or issues from a sluice opening. In all cases of this kind the\r\nprotection of the structure from scour is of primary importance.\r\n\r\nThe site of a weir or other permanent structure should, if the stream\r\nis unstable, be in a fairly straight reach, or at least not be\r\nimmediately downstream of a bend. This is because of the tendency of\r\nbends to shift downstream (CHAP. IV., _Art. 8_). There is no particular\r\nadvantage in selecting a narrow place. A narrow place is likely to be\r\ndeep or it may be liable to widen. In a hard and stable stream there is\r\nno restriction as to site.\r\n\r\nWeirs are frequently constructed for purposes of navigation, as\r\nmentioned in CHAP. VIII. They are also used in streams which are not\r\nnavigable in order that the gradient may not be too steep, and in\r\nirrigation canals for the same reason. They are used both in rivers\r\nand canals in order that the water-level may be raised and water drawn\r\noff by branch channels for purposes of manufactures, water-power or\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nUpstream of a weir there is more or less tendency for silt to deposit,\r\nbut it by no means follows that there will be deposit (CHAP. IV., _Art.\r\n2_, last par., and _Art. 3_, last par.). When deposit of sand or mud is\r\nfeared, small horizontal passages, known as “weep holes,” may be left\r\nin the weir at the level of the upstream bed. In the old Nile barrages\r\niron gratings were provided, but they were needlessly large.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\nAn inherent defect of an ordinary weir is that it obstructs the passage\r\nof floods. The obstruction may or may not be of consequence. Sometimes\r\nit is of great consequence. Attempts have been made to partially remedy\r\nthe evil by placing the weir obliquely to the stream, thus giving it\r\na greater length. At ordinary water-levels the flow over the crest of\r\nthe weir is normal to its length, or nearly so. Supposing that the\r\nwater has to be held up to a given level, the crest of the weir must be\r\nhigher, because of its greater length, than if it were normal to the\r\nstream. In a flood the water has a high velocity and flows over the\r\nweir in a direction nearly parallel to the axis of the stream, so that\r\nthe effective length of the weir is not much greater than if it were\r\nnormal to the stream, and, its crest being higher, it obstructs the\r\nflood as much. Oblique weirs are usually made as in fig. 31. If made in\r\none straight line, there might be excessive action on the bank at the\r\nlower end.\r\n\r\nIf the weir is lengthened, not by being built obliquely but by a\r\nwidening of the stream at the site, the crest has to be raised and\r\nnothing is gained.\r\n\r\nThe only arrangement by which a weir can be made to hold up water when\r\na stream is low and to let floods pass freely, consists in having part\r\nof the weir movable, _i.e._ consisting of gates, shutters or horizontal\r\nor vertical timbers, which can be withdrawn to let floods pass, and\r\ncan be manipulated to any extent so as to regulate the amount of\r\nwater passing. A familiar instance of a movable weir is the one which\r\nis usually placed across a mill stream, the wooden gates working in\r\ngrooves in the masonry.\r\n\r\nAbove a weir in Java, 162 feet long, there was a great accumulation of\r\nshingle in the bed of the river, and the head of a canal taking off\r\nabove the weir became choked. The crest of the weir on the side away\r\nfrom the canal was raised 5¼ feet and the crest sloped gradually down,\r\na length of 43 feet on the side next the canal remaining as it was.\r\nThis was quite successful. It was practically a contraction of the\r\nriver near the canal off-take, and this must have caused scour, so that\r\nthe bed became lower than the floor of the canal head and the shingle\r\nwas not carried in. The shingle, however, is said to have been carried\r\nover the weir (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. clxv.).\r\n\r\nA lock is an adjunct to a weir, used when navigation has to be provided\r\nfor. The lock may be placed close to the weir or it may be in a side\r\nchannel, the upstream end of the lock being about in a line with the\r\nweir. Locks have already been discussed in CHAP. IX., _Art. 3_.\r\n\r\nFrequently a “salmon ladder” has to be provided. It consists of a\r\nseries of steps or a zigzag arrangement so that the velocity of the\r\nwater is not too great for the fish to ascend.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =General Design of a Weir.=--Unless the bed and sides of the channel\r\nare of rock, a weir has side walls and rests on a strong floor or\r\n“apron.” These need not extend far upstream, but must extend some way\r\ndownstream because of the scouring action of the water.[11] A common\r\ntype of weir is shown in fig. 32. The downstream face is made sloping,\r\nso that the water may not fall vertically and strike the floor below\r\nthe weir. The thickness and length of the floor depend on the volume\r\nof water to be passed and on the height which it will fall and on the\r\nnature of the soil, and are generally matters of judgment, though rules\r\nregarding them, applicable to certain special cases, are given in the\r\nnext article.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe upper corners of the weir should be rounded. This prevents their\r\nbeing worn away; but the rounding of the upstream corner has another\r\nadvantage. If the corner is sharp, the stream springs clear from it and\r\nthe weir holds up the water higher, especially in floods. With small\r\ndepths of water the difference is less, and it vanishes when there is\r\nonly a trickle of water. Thus a crest rounded on the upstream side\r\nholds up low-water nearly as well as a sharp-edged crest, but lets\r\nfloods pass more freely. Any batter given to the upstream face has a\r\nsimilar advantage. The rounding is of more importance as the batter is\r\nless. For similar reasons, the upstream wing walls should be splayed\r\nor even curved so as to be tangential to the side wall, and not built\r\nnormally to the stream. These advantages are sometimes lost sight of.\r\nThe downstream walls are splayed to reduce the swirl.\r\n\r\nThe body of the weir may be of rubble and the face-work of dressed\r\nstone. In large weirs the stones are sometimes dowelled together.\r\nWhere, as in many parts of India, stone is expensive, brick is used for\r\nsmall weirs, the crest and faces being brick on edge.\r\n\r\nDownstream of the floor, unless the channel is of very hard material,\r\nthere is paving or pitching of the bed and pitching of the sides, and\r\nthese may terminate in a curtain wall. The bank pitching may be of any\r\nof the kinds described in CHAP. VI., _Art. 3_, and the bed paving as\r\ndescribed in CHAP. V., _Art. 6_, but downstream of a weir the eddying\r\nis continuous and the lap of the water on the bank is ceaseless, and\r\ngood methods are necessary. Sometimes planking, laid over a wooden\r\nframing or attached to piles, is used instead of paving and pitching.\r\n\r\nIn case the height of a weir is great relatively to its thickness, the\r\ndanger of its being overturned must be considered. To be safe against\r\noverturning, the resultant of the pressure on the weir must pass\r\nthrough the middle third of its base (see fig. 62, CHAP. XIII.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Weirs on Sandy or Porous Soil.=--If the channel is very soft or\r\nsandy the weir may be built on one or more lines of wells. The wells\r\nare not so much to support the weir as to form a curtain and prevent\r\nstreams, due to the hydraulic gradient A E (fig. 33), from forming\r\nunder the structure and gradually removing the soil. It is assumed\r\nin the case represented by the figure that the maximum head occurs\r\nwhen the downstream channel is dry. Any removal of soil from under\r\nthe weir may cause its destruction. The wells should be as close\r\ntogether as possible, and the spaces between them carefully filled up\r\nwith brickwork or concrete to as great a depth as possible, and below\r\nthat by piles. Instead of wells, lines of sheet piling--cast-iron or\r\nwood--can be used. A good fit should be made, but it is not necessary\r\nthat the joints should be absolutely water-tight. The object is to\r\nflatten the hydraulic gradient by increasing the length travelled\r\nby the water from B E to B L G H E. Of course, no flattening occurs\r\nat a point where the curtain is not water-tight, but if only small\r\ninterstices exist, none but small trickles of water can pass, and\r\nthe interstices will probably soon be choked up, just as the sand in\r\na filter bed becomes clogged and has to be washed. In any case, no\r\nimportant stream could develop otherwise than round the toe of the\r\ncurtain. It has been stated that when a curtain is water-tight the\r\nwater follows the line B L M G H K E, but this requires proof. Another\r\nplan is to cover the bed and sides of the channel with a continuous\r\nsheet of concrete extending upstream of the weir from B to D--thus\r\nflattening the hydraulic gradient from A E to F E. Instead of concrete,\r\nclay puddle can be used with pitching over it. The choice between the\r\ndifferent methods depends largely on questions of cost and facility of\r\nconstruction. It has been said that a certain amount of leakage occurs\r\nunder structures such as the Okla weir (_Art. 4_), which nevertheless\r\nremains undamaged. There have, however, been cases in which failures of\r\nworks have occurred, especially when there has been a great difference\r\nbetween the water-levels of the upstream and downstream reaches, from\r\nno other apparent cause than the passage of water underneath the works.\r\n\r\nWeirs in porous soils have been discussed by Bligh (_Engineering\r\nNews_, 29th December 1910), who gives the following as safe hydraulic\r\ngradients (_s_) or ratio of the greatest head A B to the length B E:--\r\n\r\n  Fine silt and sand as in the Nile   1 in 18\r\n  Fine micaceous sand as in Colorado\r\n    and Himalayan rivers              1 in 15\r\n  Ordinary coarse sand                1 in 12\r\n  Gravel and sand                     1 in  9\r\n  Boulders, gravel and sand           1 in  4 to 1 in 6\r\n\r\nThese figures are probably quite safe enough even for the most\r\nimportant works and for those where the heading up is constant. For\r\nsmall works or for regulators (_Art. 5_) where the heading up is not\r\nconstant, steeper gradients are permissible. Much also depends on\r\nthe condition of the water. If it contains much silt, all interstices\r\nwill probably become choked up. The hydraulic gradient in the case of\r\nthe Narora weir across the Ganges was 1 in 11. The weir failed after\r\nworking for twenty years. It was rebuilt with a gradient of 1 in 16. In\r\nthe Zifta and Assiut regulators on the Nile the gradients are 1 in 16·4\r\nand 1 in 21.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NARORA WEIR AS ORIGINALLY BUILT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NARORA WEIR AS RECONSTRUCTED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUNDATION OF THE ZIFTA REGULATOR, RIVER NILE.]\r\n\r\nRegarding the upward pressure on the floor due to the hydrostatic\r\npressure from the head A B, there is a theory that the weight of a\r\nportion of the floor at any point P should be able to balance the\r\npressure due to a head of water P R. This, supposing the masonry to be\r\ntwice as heavy as water, would give a thickness of floor equal to half\r\nP R. According to Bligh, the theoretical thickness ought, for safety,\r\nto be increased by one-third. Practically the thickness need not, in\r\nmost cases, be made even so great as is given by the theoretical rule.\r\nOn canals in the Punjab it is certainly less. Water passing through\r\nsoil or fine sand does not exert anything like the pressure which it\r\nexerts when passing through a pipe. It acts in the same manner as in a\r\ncapillary tube. It is only in coarse sand or gravel or boulders that\r\nwater flows as in a pipe.[12] If the tail water covers the floor, the\r\nweight of a portion of floor is reduced by the weight of an equal\r\nvolume of water. If the foundation of any part of the floor is higher\r\nthan B E, the upward pressure on it is reduced because the water has to\r\nforce its way upwards through the soil.\r\n\r\nBligh also states as an empirical rule that in order to provide\r\nefficiently against scour the length of floor B E should be 4/_s_\r\n√(H/13), where H is the maximum head A B; and he points out that in a\r\ncase where this length is less--as it usually is--than that necessary\r\nto give a hydraulic gradient of the requisite flatness, according to\r\nthe rule previously quoted, it is better to add an upstream floor B\r\nD, which may be of puddle and therefore cheap, than to add to the\r\ndownstream floor a length E C which must be of masonry or concrete, and\r\nthat this arrangement, by shifting the line of hydraulic gradient from\r\nA E to F E, gives a reduced upward pressure on the downstream floor.\r\n\r\nThe length E N to which pitching, if of “rip-rap” type, should extend\r\nis given by Bligh as 10/_s_ √(H/10) √(_q_/75), where _q_ is the maximum\r\ndischarge in cubic feet per second passing over a 1-foot length of the\r\nweir, and H is the head A B.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Various Types of Weirs.=--The type of weir shown in fig. 32 may\r\nbe varied by steepening or flattening the slopes of one or both\r\nfaces. Flattening increases the cost but gives a greater spread for\r\nthe foundations. It may, however, be combined with a decrease in the\r\nwidth of the crest. Flattening of the downstream slope reduces the\r\nshock of the water on the floor, but the slope itself, especially\r\nthe lower portion, has to stand a good deal of wear, and the length\r\nexposed to this is increased. Flattening the upstream slope facilitates\r\nthe passage of floods. The same result is obtained by making the\r\ncrest slope upwards (fig. 34). In a small stream or in an irrigation\r\ndistributing channel, a weir may be a simple brick wall with both faces\r\nvertical and corners rounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\nWeirs in America are often built of crib-work filled with stones. Weirs\r\nare also made of sheet piling filled in with rubble, and the top may be\r\nprotected by sheet iron. A weir made on the Mersey in connection with\r\nthe Manchester Ship Canal works was so made. There were three rows of\r\npiles and the filling in the back part was of clay.\r\n\r\nSometimes the downstream faces of weirs used to be made curved (figs.\r\n35 and 36), the object being to reduce the shock of the falling water,\r\nbut the advantage gained is not very appreciable, and this type of weir\r\nis not very common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.]\r\n\r\nThe Okla weir (fig. 37) across the river Jumna near Delhi was built\r\nabout thirty-eight years ago on the river bed, which consisted of fine\r\nsand. The depth of water over the crest in floods is 6 to 10 feet. The\r\nmaterial, except the face-work and the three walls, is dry rubble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.]\r\n\r\nWhen the reach of channel downstream of a weir has a bed-level much\r\nlower than that of the upstream reach--this is often the case in\r\nirrigation canals,--the work is known as a “fall” or “rapid.” At a\r\nfall the water generally drops vertically, and a cistern (fig. 38) is\r\nprovided. The falling water strikes that in the cistern and the shock\r\non the floor is greatly reduced. An empirical rule for the depth of the\r\ncistern, measured from the bed of the downstream reach, is\r\n\r\n    K = H + ∛H √D,\r\n\r\nwhere H is the depth of the crest of the fall below the upstream\r\nwater-level, and D is the difference between the upstream and\r\ndownstream water-levels. At some old falls on Indian canals the water,\r\nas it begins to fall into the cistern, is made to pass through a\r\ngrating which projects with an upward inclination from the crest of the\r\nweir at the downstream angle. This splits up the water and reduces the\r\nshock, but rubbish is liable to collect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.]\r\n\r\nIn the usual modern type of canal fall in India the weir has no raised\r\ncrest, and the water is held up by lateral contraction of the waterway\r\njust above the fall. The opening through which the water passes is\r\ntrapezoidal (fig. 39), being wide at the water-level and narrow at\r\nthe bed-level. In a small channel there is only one opening, but in a\r\nlarge canal there are several side by side, so that the water falls in\r\nseveral distinct streams. The curved lip shown in the plan is added\r\nto make the water spread out and cause less shock to the floor. The\r\ndimensions of the openings are calculated so that however the supply\r\nin the canal may vary, there is never any heading up or drawing down.\r\nThe detailed method of calculation for finding C F and the ratio of\r\nA B to B C is given in _Hydraulics_, CHAP. IV. In cases where it is\r\nonly necessary for the notch to be accurate when the depth of water\r\nranges from B C to three-fourths B C, it will suffice to calculate\r\nas follows:--Let _b_ be the bed width of the canal, and let Q be the\r\ndischarge and B the mean width of the stream when the depth of water is\r\nB C. Decide on the number of notches, and let W be the width of a notch\r\ncalculated as if it were to be rectangular, _i.e._ by the ordinary\r\nweir formula. Increase the width to W´ = 1·05 W. Then make the notch\r\ntrapezoidal, keeping the mean width W´, and making the bottom width _w_\r\n(or C F), such that _w_/W´ = _b_/B. The top width of the notch is of\r\ncourse increased as much as the bottom width is reduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.]\r\n\r\nA rapid has a long downstream slope, which is expensive to construct\r\nand difficult to keep in repair, especially as the canals can only be\r\nclosed for short periods. Rapids exist in large numbers on the Bari\r\nDoab Canal in India, the face-work consisting in many cases of rounded\r\nundressed boulders--with the interstices filled up by spawls and\r\nconcrete--which stand the wear well. Rapids have again been used on the\r\nmore modern canals in places where boulders are obtainable, and where\r\ndeep foundations would have given trouble in unwatering. The upstream\r\nface of a rapid is vertical, or has a steep slope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Weirs with Sluices.=--The long weirs built across Indian rivers\r\nbelow the heads of irrigation canals generally extend across the\r\ngreater part of the river bed. In the remaining part--generally the\r\npart nearest the canal head--there is, instead of the weir, a set of\r\nopenings or “under-sluices” (fig. 40) with piers having iron grooves in\r\nwhich gates can slide vertically. The piers may be twenty feet apart\r\nand five feet thick. The gates are worked by one or more “travellers,”\r\nwhich run on rails on the arched roadway. The traveller is provided\r\nwith screw gearing to start a gate which sticks. When once started it\r\nis easily lifted by the ordinary gears. The gates descend by their own\r\nweight. The gate in each opening is usually in two halves, upper and\r\nlower, each in its own grooves, and both can be lifted clear of the\r\nfloods. In intermediate stages of the river these gates have to be\r\nworked a good deal. (See also CHAP. V., _Art. 5_.) Usually the weir\r\nhas, all along its crest, a set of hinged shutters, which lie flat at\r\nall seasons, except that of low water in the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe canal head consists of smaller arched openings, provided with gates\r\nworking in vertical grooves and lifted by a light traveller. If the\r\nfloor of the canal head is higher than the beds of the river and the\r\ncanal, it may be said to be a weir, but otherwise the canal head is\r\nmerely a set of sluices without a weir.\r\n\r\nThe barrage of the Nile at Assiut (fig. 41), and the old barrages of\r\nthe Rosetta and Damietta branches, consist of sets of sluices without\r\nweirs. At Assiut there are piers five metres apart and gates working in\r\ngrooves like those, above described, at Indian headworks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.]\r\n\r\nThe “dam” across the Ravi, at the head of the Sidhnai Canal in the\r\nPunjab, also consists of sluice openings without a weir. The piers are\r\nconnected by horizontal beams (fig. 42), against which, and against\r\na sill at their lower ends, rest a number of nearly vertical timber\r\n“needles,” fitting close together, which can be removed when necessary\r\nby men standing on a foot-bridge. In floods the needles are all removed\r\nand laid on the high-level bridge (not shown in the drawing), the\r\nfoot-bridge being then submerged. With needles the span between two\r\npiers can be greater than would be possible with a gate. Needles can\r\nbe used up to a length of 12 or 14 feet, excluding the handle which\r\nprojects above the horizontal beam. They can be of pine, about 5 inches\r\ndeep in the direction of the stream, and 4 inches thick.\r\n\r\nWhere a branch takes off from a canal in India there are usually no\r\nfixed weirs but two sets of piers--one in the canal and one in the\r\nbranch,--with openings and gates like those at the canal heads, or else\r\nwith wider openings and needles. These works are called regulators.\r\nThe gates are worked by travellers or by fixed windlasses or racks and\r\npinions. Very small gates for distributaries are often worked entirely\r\nby screw gearing. For the smaller branches the gates are replaced by\r\nsets of planks or timbers lying one above another and removed by means\r\nof hooks. They are replaced by means of the hooks or by being held in\r\nposition some little height above the water, and dropped. They are\r\nfinally closed up by ramming.\r\n\r\nIn the case of either planks or needles, leakage can be much reduced by\r\nthrowing shavings or chopped straw into the water upstream of them.\r\n\r\nNeedles can be provided on their downstream sides with eye-bolts just\r\nabove the level of the beam against which their upper ends rest. They\r\ncan then be attached by chains or cords to the beam or to the next\r\npier, and cannot be lost when released. They can be released by a lever\r\nwhich can be inserted under the eye-bolt. By pushing the head of a\r\nneedle forward and inserting a piece of wood under it, a little water\r\ncan be let through. In this way, or by removing needles here and there,\r\nthe discharge can be adjusted with exactness.\r\n\r\nAt a needle weir in an Indian canal all the needles in one opening are\r\nreported to have broken simultaneously. A possible explanation is that\r\none needle broke and that the velocity thus set up in the approaching\r\nstream caused the others to break. On another occasion when a canal was\r\ndry all the needles were blown down.\r\n\r\nSometimes the beam or bar against which the upper ends of the needles\r\nrest is itself movable. At Ravenna, in Italy, the bar between any two\r\npiers has a vertical pivot at one pier and can swing horizontally. Its\r\nother end is held by a prolongation of the next bar, near to its pivot.\r\nIf the end bar of the weir is released, each bar in turn is released\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\nAt Teddington on the Thames the oblique weir, 480 feet long, has\r\nthirty-five gates, which extend over half the length of the weir. They\r\nare worked by travellers which run on a foot-bridge. The openings do\r\nnot extend down to the river bed, but are placed on the top of a low\r\nweir. The other half of the weir is fixed. The gates are raised to let\r\nfloods pass.\r\n\r\nAt Richmond on the Thames the arrangements are similar, the gates being\r\ncounterbalanced to admit of easy and rapid raising. When raised they\r\nare tilted into a horizontal position so as not to obstruct the view.\r\n\r\nIn Stoney’s sluice gates a set of rollers is interposed between the\r\ngate and the groove. The rollers are suspended from a chain, one end\r\nof which is attached to the top of the gate and the other end to the\r\ngroove. The rollers thus move up or down at half the rate of the gate,\r\nand some of them are always in the proper position for taking the\r\npressure. Escape of water between the gate and the groove is prevented\r\nby a rod which is suspended on the upstream side of the gate close\r\nto its end, and is pressed by the water against the pier. Stoney’s\r\nsluice gates, with spans ranging up to 30 feet, have been used on the\r\nManchester Ship Canal for the sluices by which the water of the river\r\nWeaver is passed across the canal, and at locks for passing the flood\r\nwaters of the Irwell and Mersey down the canal. The gates are balanced\r\nby counterweights.\r\n\r\nFrame weirs,[13] used chiefly on rivers in France but also in Belgium\r\nand Germany, are a modification of the needle and plank arrangements\r\nabove described. For the masonry piers there are substituted iron\r\nframes or trestles, which are hinged at the floor-level so that, when\r\nthe timbers have been removed, the frame can be turned over sideways\r\nand lie flat on the floor, thus leaving the waterway absolutely clear\r\nfrom side to side of the stream. The foot-bridge which rests on the\r\nframes is removed piece by piece. The frames are raised again by means\r\nof chains attached to them. In order that the frames may not be too\r\nheavy they are spaced 3 to 4 feet apart, or very much nearer than when\r\nmasonry piers are used. Horizontal planks can thus be used of shorter\r\nlengths than the needles, and they can be made up into greater widths\r\nso that the leakage is less.\r\n\r\nA further modification consists in placing the bridge platform above\r\nflood-level, and in hinging the frames to it instead of to the floor.\r\nThe frame turns about a horizontal axis parallel to the length of the\r\nweir. A weir of this kind can be used for greater depths of water than\r\nthe ordinary frame weir.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the horizontal planks are connected together by hinges so\r\nthat they form a “curtain.” The curtain is raised by rolling it up by\r\nmeans of a traveller. It admits of rapid and accurate adjustment of the\r\nwater-level, but there is considerable scouring action below a curtain\r\nwhen it is somewhat raised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =Falling Shutters.=--In Thénard’s system, first used in France,\r\na shutter (fig. 43) is hinged at its lower edge and is held up by\r\na strut. When the lower end of the strut is pushed aside it slides\r\ndownstream and the shutter falls flat. To enable the shutter to\r\nbe raised again an upstream shutter, which ordinarily lies flat\r\nand is held down by a bolt, is released, and it is then raised by\r\nthe current to the extent permitted by a chain attached to it. The\r\ndownstream shutter is then raised. Thénard’s system was not much used\r\nin France because the river had to fall to a level somewhat too low\r\nfor navigation before the shutters could be raised. The sudden jerk\r\non the chain of the upstream shutter is also liable to do damage. The\r\nsystem has been adopted on some of the long weirs which cross Indian\r\nrivers downstream of the heads of irrigation canals. To prevent damage\r\nby shock, a hydraulic brake was designed by Fouracres. It consists of\r\na piston which travels along a cylinder and drives water out through\r\nsmall holes. The shutters are placed on the top of the fixed weir,\r\nwhere they usually lie flat, except in the low water season, any\r\nadjustments of the river discharge being effected by means of the\r\nunder-sluices.\r\n\r\nIn the Chanoine system of falling shutters (fig. 44), used first in\r\nFrance, the shutter is hinged at a point rather higher than the centre\r\nof pressure. The hinge is supported by a vertical trestle, which is\r\nhinged at its lower end and is supported by a strut which slides in\r\na groove and rests against a stop. When the water rises to a certain\r\nheight above the top of the shutter, it is turned by the force of\r\nthe water into a horizontal position. The struts can then be pushed\r\nsideways out of the stops by means of a “tripping bar,” which lies\r\nalong the floor parallel to the line of shutters and is worked from the\r\nbank. The struts, trestles, and shutters then fall flat. To close the\r\nweir the shutters are first raised into the horizontal position which\r\nthey occupied before falling, by means of a hook worked from a boat or\r\nby chains attached to a foot-bridge running across the river upstream\r\nof the weir. They can then be easily closed by a boat-hook. The water\r\ncloses them of itself if it falls low enough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.]\r\n\r\nWhen the shutters fall a great rush of water occurs. To obviate this\r\na valve is made in the upper half of the shutter. It consists of a\r\nminiature shutter on the same principle as the main shutter. The pivot\r\nof the main shutter is made at such a height that the shutter will not\r\nturn over when only a small depth of water flows over it. Instead of\r\nthis the valve comes into operation. The valve also facilitates the\r\nraising of the shutter. Again, instead of the tripping bar, which\r\nwould sometimes have to be of great length or be liable to damage owing\r\nto stones jamming in its teeth, the shutter can be released by pulling\r\nthe strut upstream so that it falls into a second groove, down which\r\nit slides. When a tripping bar is used, its teeth can be so arranged\r\nthat the shutters are released a few at a time, first singly, then\r\nin twos and threes. Sometimes there are gaps of a few inches between\r\none shutter and the next, and the gaps can be closed by needles if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nChanoine shutters can be very rapidly lowered, and they are used in\r\nFrance and in the U.S.A. in places where sudden floods occur. They\r\nare also used for navigation “passes” where most of the heavy traffic\r\nis downstream and where it is too heavy to be dealt with in a lock. A\r\nfoot-bridge across the stream or across the navigation pass is always\r\nan assistance, but sometimes it cannot be used when there is much\r\nfloating rubbish or ice. With a foot-bridge the cost is greater than\r\nthat of a needle weir.[14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.]\r\n\r\nIn the Bear Trap weir (fig. 45) the upstream shutter rests against\r\nthe downstream one. Both are raised by admitting water from the upper\r\nreach, by means of a culvert, through an opening in the side wall, and\r\nthey are made to fall by placing this opening in communication with\r\nthe downstream instead of the upstream reach. This kind of shutter is\r\nonly suitable for passes of moderate width, and it is rather expensive\r\non account of the culverts.[15]\r\n\r\nShutters with fixed supports are used on the Irwell and Mersey. A fixed\r\nframe is built across the stream (fig. 46) and the shutters are hinged\r\nto it. When the water rises to a certain height above its top, the\r\nshutter turns into a horizontal position, but as this causes a severe\r\nrush of water the shutter is usually raised by a chain attached to its\r\nlower end and worked from the bank. When in a horizontal position,\r\nit is held there by a ratchet. When the stream falls the ratchet is\r\nreleased and the shutter is closed by the stream. This kind of shutter\r\ncannot be used where there is navigation.\r\n\r\nOn the weir 4000 feet long across the river Chenab at Khanki in the\r\nPunjab, the falling shutters, 6 feet high and 3 feet wide, are hinged\r\nat the base and held up by a tie-rod on the upstream side. The trigger\r\nwhich releases the rod is actuated by means of a wire rope carrying a\r\nsteel ball, and worked by a winch from the abutment of the weir or from\r\none of the piers, which are 500 feet apart. A winch is fixed on the top\r\nof each pier, and communication with the piers is effected by means of\r\na cradle slung from a steel wire rope, which rests on standards and\r\nruns across the weir. The wire rope which carries the steel ball passes\r\nover a series of forks, one on each shutter. When one trigger has been\r\nreleased, that shutter falls and the ball hangs loose. A further haul\r\non the rope causes it to actuate the trigger of the next shutter, and\r\nso on. If it is desired to drop only some of the shutters, the rope\r\nis passed over the forks of those shutters only. The shutters can\r\nbe raised by means of a crane which runs along the weir on rails\r\ndownstream of the shutters or, if the water is too high to allow of\r\nthis, by a crane in the stern of a boat which is moored upstream of the\r\nweir and allowed to drop down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. =Adjustable Weirs.=--Drum weirs, invented by Desfontaines, have\r\nbeen used in France and Germany. Two paddles (fig. 47) are fixed on a\r\nhorizontal axis and can turn through about 90°, the lower paddle, which\r\nshould be slightly the larger, working in a “drum,” which is roofed\r\nover and can, by means of sluices, be placed in communication with\r\neither the upper or lower reach of the stream. According as the upper\r\npaddle is to be raised or lowered, water is admitted from the upper\r\nreach above or below the lower paddle, the water on its other side\r\nbeing at the same time placed in communication with the lower reach.\r\nOn the weirs first made on the Marne, the height of the upper paddle\r\nwas 3 feet 7½ inches, and there were, in a weir, a number of pairs of\r\npaddles, each being 4 feet 11 inches wide. By having sluices at both\r\nabutments communicating with both reaches, and by opening or closing\r\neach of them more or less, the various paddles can be made to take up\r\ndifferent positions, and thus perfect control over the discharge is\r\nobtained by simply turning a handle to control a sluice gate. A weir\r\nhas since been made with a single pair of paddles extending right\r\nacross the opening (33 feet), and the height of the upper paddle is\r\nover 9 feet.[16]\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to drum weirs is the necessity for the hollow or\r\ndrum, which renders the work very expensive, except when only a small\r\ndepth of water is held up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe old sluice gates of the Nile barrages were made segmental (fig.\r\n48), turned on pivots in the piers, and were raised by chains.\r\n\r\nIn some factories in Bavaria and Switzerland there are self-acting\r\nshutters which revolve on a horizontal axis at the lower edge, and\r\nare counterbalanced by cylindrical weights which roll on ways in the\r\nside wall. This arrangement is suitable when there is only one span,\r\nwhich can, however, be as great as 30 feet. An adjustable weir used\r\nat Schweinfurt on the Maine, consists of a hollow iron cylinder, 59\r\nfeet long and 10 feet in diameter, running across the stream. The\r\ncylinder is pear-shaped in cross-sections, and can be made, by means of\r\nmechanism, to revolve, the water passing over it. Another kind used at\r\nMulhausen on the Rhine consists of a hollow iron cylinder 85 feet long\r\nand 9·8 feet in diameter. The whole cylinder can be raised by winches\r\n(_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vols. cliii. and clvi.).\r\n\r\n\r\n8. =Remarks on Sluices.=--In all kinds of sluice openings or\r\nregulators, the principles of design as regards protection of the bed\r\nand sides, splaying and curving of walls and piers, thickness of floor,\r\nand prevention of the formation of streams under the structure are the\r\nsame as laid down for weirs.\r\n\r\nIn order that a pier may be safe from being overturned by the pressure\r\nof the water when the gates or timbers are down, the resultant of its\r\nweight, including that of anything resting on it, and of the water\r\npressure on it, must pass through the middle third of its length. This\r\ngenerally occurs when there is an arched roadway. Otherwise it must be\r\narranged for by prolonging the base of the piers downstream, and giving\r\nthe downstream side a batter or steps.\r\n\r\nThe floor should usually be placed at a level somewhat lower than the\r\nmean bed-level of the stream. The bed may possibly be lowered in course\r\nof time. Lowering the floor also gives a greater thickness of water\r\ncushion to take the shock of water falling over the gates or planks. It\r\nis convenient to build, on the floor, a low wall or sill, reaching up\r\nto the level of the bed or thereabouts, and running across from pier\r\nto pier under the line of gates or needles. The height of the gates\r\nor needles can thus be reduced, and there is little chance of silt or\r\nstones collecting and interfering with them. In the case of needles the\r\nwall must be strong enough to resist their horizontal pressure. If ever\r\nthe bed is lowered, the wall can easily be cut down or removed.\r\n\r\nSluices with gates are, of course, used in connection with works other\r\nthan weirs or regulators, as, for instance, in reservoirs or locks, or\r\ngenerally for communication between any two bodies of water. The gate\r\nmay or may not be wholly submerged. If it is not wholly submerged,\r\nplanks can be used. Needles can be used if the flow is always in one\r\ndirection and never in the reverse direction. In all cases protection\r\ndownstream of the opening is required.\r\n\r\nIn designing a set of sluice openings or regulators, it is sometimes\r\nthe custom to make the total area of waterway the same as that of the\r\nstream in its unobstructed condition. There is no particular reason why\r\nit should be the same. In a description of the Assiut Barrage (_Min.\r\nProc. Inst. C.E._, vol. clviii., p. 30), it is mentioned that one of\r\nthe reasons for placing the floor lower than the river bed was that\r\nthe width of the waterway of the barrage was less than that of the\r\nriver. The bed has to be heavily protected in any case, and the proper\r\nprinciple is to fix a velocity which is considered to be safe and, the\r\nmaximum discharge being known, to determine the area of the waterway\r\naccordingly. In the case of a very wide river like the Nile, with a\r\nwell-defined channel, it is inconvenient to make the distance between\r\nthe abutments of a work much less than the width of the channel, but\r\nso far as velocity is concerned, the floor need not usually be lower\r\nthan the bed. The protection given to the channel on the upstream side\r\nof the barrage (fig. 41) seems to be rather greater than necessary.\r\nThe thickness of the floor (9 feet 10 inches) seems excessive. The\r\nthickness originally proposed was much less.\r\n\r\nOf the many kinds of apparatus described in this chapter each\r\npossesses some advantages and disadvantages. Gates require a bridge\r\nwith powerful lifting apparatus, and are suitable for large bodies of\r\nwater and great depths. Comparing needles with planks, the former can\r\nbe worked by one man and admit of rapid removal, and require far fewer\r\npiers. Planks require two men, and are sometimes liable to jam, but\r\nobstruct floating rubbish less than needles, and in shallow water give\r\nrise to less leakage. Whether needles or planks are used, masonry piers\r\nare most suitable where sand or gravel are liable to accumulate on the\r\nfloor, or where there is much floating rubbish. The hinged frames are\r\nsuitable in other cases. Falling shutters of the Chanoine type admit of\r\nvery rapid lowering, and can be used without a foot-bridge. The drum\r\nweir is perfect in action, but its cost is high.\r\n\r\nAt any system of sluices the regulation should be so arranged as to\r\nminimise the chances of damage to the bed and banks where this is at\r\nall likely to occur. If the gates are opened only near one side of the\r\nstructure, there will be a rush of water on that side, and serious\r\ndamage may occur. The opening should be done symmetrically and, as far\r\nas possible, distributed along the whole length.\r\n\r\nUntil experience has shown it to be unnecessary, soundings should be\r\ntaken at regular periods of time downstream of every important work\r\nwhere scour can occur. When scour is found to have occurred at any\r\nparticular part of the work, the rush of water at such places should,\r\nas far as possible, be prevented, and a chance given for silting to\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nUnless experience shows that damage is not likely to occur, a stock\r\nof concrete blocks, sandbags, or other suitable materials should be\r\nkept on the spot ready for use. Life-buoys should be provided on any\r\nwork where large volumes of water are dealt with, especially if it is\r\nunfenced in any part, or if any of the men employed are casual workers.\r\n\r\nRegarding works for preventing a river from shifting its course so as\r\nto damage or destroy a weir or similar work, see CHAP. XI., _Art. 3_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nBRIDGES AND SYPHONS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Bridges.=--Bridges are of many kinds. In this book only those parts\r\nof them are considered which are exposed to the stream. If a bridge has\r\npiers, there must be some disturbance of the water. The disturbance\r\nwill be least when the area of the waterway of the bridge is at least\r\nas great as that of the stream, and when its shape is as nearly as\r\npossible the same. For small streams, a single span clearing the whole\r\nstream may be adopted, especially when the channel is of soft material,\r\nbut for a large stream the cost of intermediate piers, even with a\r\ncertain amount of protection for them or with deep foundations, will be\r\nmore than counterbalanced by the smaller thickness of arch or depth of\r\ngirder.\r\n\r\nGenerally a bridge has vertical abutments which limit the waterway,\r\nbut it may have land-spans, and in this case the stream as it rises\r\ncan spread out. Piers and abutments should be so designed that abrupt\r\nchanges in the section of the stream are, as far as possible, avoided,\r\nthe piers being rounded or boat-shaped at both ends and the abutments\r\nsuitably curved (fig. 49). Boat-shaped piers, besides presenting the\r\nneatest appearance, cause the least amount of disturbance.\r\n\r\nA bridge can be made safe against scour either by giving deep\r\nfoundations to the piers and abutments or by adding a floor and, if\r\nnecessary, pitching. The former course is usually adopted and is\r\nthe best. But in a case in which the discharge of a stream is to be\r\nincreased or has been underestimated, it is often far easier to add a\r\nfloor to an existing bridge than to increase the span of the bridge. In\r\norder to increase the waterway the floor can be “dished,” _i.e._ made\r\nat a level lower than the bed of the stream[17] and gradually sloped\r\nup--the slopes being pitched--both upstream and downstream of the\r\nbridge, to meet the bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.]\r\n\r\nIn any case in which the water rises above the crown of the arch, the\r\nbridge becomes a syphon, and a floor is probably necessary unless the\r\nfoundations are very deep, or unless the rise of water above the crown\r\nis temporary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of Indian rivers which have soft channels, and are\r\nordinarily of moderate width but are subject to occasional floods when\r\nthe width of the stream is multiplied several times and becomes very\r\ngreat, it is the rule to make the span of a railway bridge far less\r\nthan this greater width. The stream during floods scours out a deep\r\nchannel through the bridge with great rapidity, and no heading up worth\r\nmentioning occurs. The foundations of the piers are very deep, being\r\nfrequently 50 feet below the lowest point of the river bed which can\r\nbe found anywhere within several miles of the bridge. The span of the\r\nbridge can be arrived at by considering a general cross-section of\r\nthe river as it is when in high flood, and assuming that scour to the\r\ndepth of the lowest point, found as just explained, will take place in\r\none-third of the span of the bridge. The span can then be so fixed as\r\nto give no heading up. It is not assumed that there will be no increase\r\nin velocity through the bridge. The velocity in the deep scoured\r\nportions will be increased. The piers are protected by loose stone\r\n(fig. 50). The spans vary from 100 to 250 feet. The bridge over the\r\nriver Chenab at Wazirabad had originally sixty-four spans of 145 feet\r\neach. The number of spans has since been reduced to twenty-eight. With\r\na very long bridge, the current of the shifting stream is more likely\r\nto strike the bridge obliquely, though this is not the chief reason for\r\nreducing the length. Long spans, say 250 feet, have been found to be\r\nbetter than shorter spans; the cost of the stone protection round the\r\npiers is of course less (_Government of India Technical Paper_, No.\r\n153, “River Training and Control on the Guide Bank System,” by Sir F.\r\nJ. E. Spring, C.I.E., 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Syphons and Culverts.=--Syphons are used to pass drainage channels\r\nor other streams under canals or other lines of communication. In the\r\ncase of a masonry syphon under a stream which may be dry while the\r\nsyphon is full, the weight of the arch and its solid load must be not\r\nless than the upward pressure of the water passing through the syphon.\r\nThe channel sometimes has a vertical drop at the upstream side (fig.\r\n51) and a slope at the downstream side. The slope enables any solid\r\nmaterials to be carried through, and facilitates cleaning out and\r\nunwatering. The drop at the upstream side does not give rise to any\r\nshock on the floor when the syphon is full, but a slope is preferable\r\nif there is room for it, and it causes less loss of head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.]\r\n\r\nA culvert which is liable to run full and which has a steep approach\r\nchannel (fig. 52) may become suddenly drowned on the upstream side. As\r\nsoon as the water rises to the crown of the arch, the wet border of\r\nthe culvert increases and this reduces the velocity and discharge. The\r\nwater coming down the approach channel then rises abruptly, and the\r\nincreased section of the stream causes a reduced velocity of approach,\r\nand this further reduces the discharge through the culvert. The heading\r\nup continues until the difference in the upstream and downstream\r\nwater-levels is great enough to readjust matters (_Min. Proc. Inst.\r\nC.E._, vol. clxxxvi.). The possibility of this heading up occurring\r\nshould be attended to in the design. In the case of a culvert in a\r\nrailway embankment where heavy floods have to be passed, the culvert\r\nmay be made bell-mouthed by a curved embankment constructed on its\r\nupstream side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Training Works.=--The object of the upstream and downstream\r\nprotections already described (CHAP. X.) is to prevent damage to the\r\nstructure owing to the disturbance caused by the structure itself.\r\nWhen a river is given to shifting its course (CHAP. IV., _Art. 9_)\r\nand cutting away its banks, protection of another kind is required.\r\nThe stream, if left to itself, may cut away one bank upstream of the\r\nstructure for a long distance, and eventually damage, or destroy by\r\nundermining, the upstream pitching and the abutment itself. This is\r\nknown as outflanking. If in the neighbourhood of the line A B (fig.\r\n53) there is nothing for the river to damage,--if, for instance, the\r\nstructure is a weir with a canal, if any, only on the opposite bank of\r\nthe river,--and if the land is of no particular value, the case could\r\nconceivably be met by protecting the abutment on all sides, but even\r\nthen there might be a chance of the erosion of the bank continuing\r\nuntil the stream had formed a connection at C with the downstream\r\nreach. This, of course, in the case of a weir, would render the work\r\nuseless and might even destroy it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of a bridge carrying a road or railway, or of a syphon or\r\naqueduct carrying a canal or other stream, it is wholly inadmissible\r\nto allow the stream to cut away even as far as the point A for fear\r\nof its severing the line of communication. Thus in every case it is\r\npractically necessary to prevent any serious erosion of the bank\r\nupstream of the structure. In ordinary cases it is sufficient to\r\nprotect the bank C D by any of the methods given in CHAP. VI., _Art.\r\n3_, the protection being turned inwards, as shown at D, to prevent the\r\nend of it being damaged.\r\n\r\nIn the case of railway bridges across the great shifting rivers of\r\nIndia, protection used at one time to be afforded by various systems\r\nof spurs. This has now been abandoned in favour of Bell’s guide banks\r\n(fig. 54), which are found to be far more satisfactory. These guide\r\nbanks are discussed in the paper by Spring quoted above (_Art. 1_).\r\nThe spaces behind the guide banks become filled with water, at least\r\nduring floods, and are meant to be silted up. An opening in the\r\nrailway embankment should be provided at A, and another on the opposite\r\nside of the river, to ensure a constant flow of water (CHAP. V., _Art.\r\n3_), but they should not be large enough to cause high velocity. The\r\nchief danger to which a guide bank is liable is outflanking when the\r\nstream assumes the position shown. To guard against this danger it is\r\nnecessary to have very strong and massive heads to the guide banks.\r\nWhen the bank of the eroding stream, downstream of the guide bank head,\r\nbecomes a semicircle or thereabouts, the stream takes a short-cut\r\nacross the sandbank, and to encourage this an artificial cut can be\r\ndug, at the season of low water, on any suitable line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.]\r\n\r\nIf the guide banks were made with an increased width of opening at\r\nthe upper end, this would reduce the chance of outflanking but would\r\nincrease the danger from a direct attack such as indicated, in the\r\nfigure, on the left bank. It has been suggested that the width at\r\nthe upstream end should be less than at the bridge, but this seems\r\nundesirable. Probably the form shown in fig. 54 is the proper one. The\r\nlength of the guide bank upstream of the bridge is made about equal\r\nto the span of the bridge between the two guide banks. If made less\r\nthan this, the river might cut into the line of railway. The length of\r\nguide bank downstream of the bridge is generally 300 to 500 feet, being\r\ngreater as the velocity of the river is greater and the sand of its bed\r\nfiner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.]\r\n\r\nThe Bengal Dooars Railway runs near the foot of the Bhutan Himalayas,\r\nand crosses some broad river channels which, after the excessively\r\nheavy rains which occur, are filled by streams of very high velocities.\r\nOne such channel or set of channels (fig. 55), more than half a mile\r\nwide, is provided with a bridge whose waterway consists of ten spans\r\nof 60 feet each. The railway embankment across the remainder of the\r\nchannel having been breached in many places in 1903, protection was\r\nafforded by T-headed spurs and other groynes, the first arrangement,\r\nwhich withstood the floods of 1904, being as shown in the figure. The\r\ntriangular apex of the A-shaped groyne, south-east of the bridge, was\r\nadded in 1905 because, in its absence, the water struck the bridge\r\nobliquely. After the addition there was a great deposit of silt in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the four T-headed spurs. Next year the river,\r\nin a great flood, rose over the top of the railway embankment near\r\nthese spurs, and finally caused a breach 600 feet wide. The embankment\r\nwas afterwards raised. The velocity through the bridge seems to have\r\napproached 18 feet per second. The bridge had at first no floor. A\r\nfloor was added, but was much damaged by the floods (_Min. Proc. Inst.\r\nC.E._, vol. clxxiii.). The level of the floor is not given, but it\r\nwould seem to have been desirable to make it at a very low level. The\r\nrising of the stream over the railway embankment was attributed to the\r\nsilting up near the T-headed spurs. The addition of the triangular\r\nportion above referred to would seem to have somewhat assisted this\r\nprocess. If all the trouble could have been foreseen, it might have\r\nbeen best to build an additional bridge 2000 feet south-east of the\r\nexisting bridge. The groynes were composed of the wire-network rolls,\r\ndescribed in CHAP. VI., _Art. 3_, piled pyramid fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE AND FLOODS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.=--_Arts. 2_ and _3_ of this Chapter deal\r\nwith the calculation of flood discharges, _Art. 2_ dealing with small\r\nstreams, in which the water has to be got rid of, and _Art. 3_ with\r\nlarge streams. The remaining articles discuss the methods of predicting\r\nfloods and of preventing them from doing damage. When the discharge\r\nfigures have been arrived at in any case, the necessary masonry works\r\ncan be designed in accordance with the principles described in CHAPS.\r\nX. and XI. For remarks regarding the design of channels and banks, see\r\nCHAP. IX., _Art. 4_, and also _Art. 6_ of the present Chapter.\r\n\r\nIn England, land near a stream or flooded area is said to be “awash”\r\nwhen the flood water rises to within 3 feet of the surface of the\r\nground. The drainage of such land is apt to be unsatisfactory. If land\r\nis flooded or awash, it may be desirable to shift the outfall of a\r\nbranch drain to a point lower down in the main outfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Small Streams.=--In dealing with small streams, such as branch\r\ndrains or natural streams not far from their sources, the engineer\r\nis concerned only with their maximum discharges. He has to design\r\nculverts, bridges or syphons to pass the streams under roads or other\r\nworks, or to design channels or waste weirs for them. In a settled\r\ncountry there may be already some works in existence on the same\r\nstream, and these may form a guide, or it may be possible to obtain\r\nlocal information as to the height or volume of floods. Even in such a\r\ncase rainfall figures will be most useful. In districts where there is\r\nno settled population, and in any case where the stream is ill-defined,\r\nand the flow fitful, the rainfall figures may afford the only, or at\r\nleast far the best, means of estimating the discharge.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall to be considered in all these cases is the maximum likely\r\nto fall in a short period of time. The catchment areas dealt with are\r\nsmall, say 5 square miles or less. It must be assumed that the fall of\r\nrain extends to all parts of the catchment area, and that its duration\r\nis sufficient for the water from all parts of it to reach the site of\r\nthe work. The different valleys or divisions of the catchment area\r\nshould be considered separately, and regard must be had, not only to\r\nthe area of each division, but to its length and declivity measured\r\nalong the course of the stream which drains it. On these two factors\r\ndepend the time taken by the rain water to reach the site of the work.\r\nThe rate at which the rain water flows over the ground into rills or\r\nsmall subsidiary streams may be taken to be ¼ mile per hour in flat\r\nland, and 1 mile per hour on steep hill sides. The velocity of the\r\ncurrent in the rills and larger streams is generally 2 to 4 miles per\r\nhour. It can, when necessary, be calculated roughly from the size and\r\nslope of the stream. To be on the safe side, the highest probable\r\nfigure can be taken.\r\n\r\nThe time taken by the water to flow from the furthest points of the\r\ncatchment area to the site of the work having been arrived at as above,\r\nthe next thing is to estimate the probable maximum intensity of the\r\nrainfall during that time over the whole catchment area. The only\r\nfigures immediately available will be the mean annual rainfall, or\r\nperhaps the maximum fall in twenty-four hours, but it has been shown\r\n(CHAP. II., _Art. 5_) how the probable maximum fall over a shorter\r\nperiod may be estimated.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be calculated is the “run-off,” _i.e._ the probable\r\nproportion of the rainfall which will at once run off. This may be less\r\nthan the proportion which will eventually become “available,” because\r\nsome of it may go to feed the underground supply from which springs are\r\nfed. The proportion running off a small area in a short time would,\r\nunder most circumstances, be rather difficult to estimate, but in the\r\ncase under consideration, only the probable maximum figure is required.\r\nThis occurs when the ground is saturated. Under these circumstances the\r\nratio of the run-off to the total fall may be somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Steep rocky hillsides  ·70 to ·90\r\n  Ordinary hills         ·50 ”  ·75\r\n  Undulating country     ·40 ”  ·50\r\n  Flat country           ·30 ”  ·35\r\n\r\nThe figures can be increased when the surface is specially hard or\r\nfrozen, and decreased when it is soft, sandy, covered with woods or\r\nvegetation, or cultivated.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the above procedure is necessary in its entirety\r\ndepends chiefly on the size of the proposed work and on the degree\r\nof inconvenience likely to arise from any wrong estimation of the\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nIn designing syphons to carry torrents across the Upper Jhelum Canal\r\nin the Punjab, the discharge from a catchment area of ·79 square miles\r\nwas found to be about 4000 cubic feet per second. This is at the rate\r\nof about 5000 cubic feet per second per square mile, and is equivalent\r\nto a run-off of 7·8 inches in an hour. The catchment area was among\r\nlow hills, not far from the Himalayas, and the declivities of the\r\nrills were very steep. The superintending engineer, Mr R. E. Purves,\r\nstates[18] that the discharge observations were reliable, and that\r\nfalls of rain of an inch in ten minutes occur not infrequently, even\r\nthough the fall in twenty-four hours might not exceed 2 or 3 inches. In\r\norder to account for the discharge in the case under consideration, it\r\nwould at first seem to be necessary to assume not only that a fall at\r\nthe rate of 7·8 inches per hour had occurred, but that the whole of it\r\nhad run off. It is not, however, necessary to assume quite so much. The\r\nground being saturated, the rain falling in a period of five minutes\r\nmight be reaching the discharge site with little loss. A suddenly\r\nincreased fall at the rate of 6 inches per hour might then occur, and\r\nthe water travelling more quickly and with hardly any loss, would\r\novertake that already passing the site. This case seems to show that\r\nfor a very small catchment area the whole of the fall, and more, must\r\nbe allowed for.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Engineer of the Punjab did not accept the above figures.[19]\r\nHe remarked that observations taken under great difficulties as to time\r\nand place are liable to error, and he considered that an allowance\r\nof rainfall at the rate of 4·8 inches per hour--a rate which had\r\nbeen observed elsewhere--and a run-off of ·75 of the fall would be\r\nsufficient. He accepted a discharge of 2000 cubic feet per second for\r\ncatchment areas of less than 5 square miles, assuming the run-off to\r\nbe ·75 of the fall, but afterwards increased the figure to 2400 cubic\r\nfeet per second. The chief engineer did not overlook the fact that\r\nin the designs for the drainage aqueducts a free-board of 5 feet had\r\nbeen allowed, and perhaps this led to an acceptance of an estimated\r\ndischarge less than would otherwise have been accepted. It does not\r\nseem to be at all certain that the figure put forward by Mr Purves was\r\nfar wrong. When the original project estimate for the Upper Jhelum\r\nCanal was framed, the irrigation engineers had had no experience of\r\nsmall and steep catchments, and no one had suspected that the discharge\r\nper square mile would be anything like the above. The sums of money\r\nprovided for works for the passages of torrents had to be increased in\r\nratios varying from 2·5 to 1 to 6 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe following statement shows the figures for other small catchment\r\nareas in the neighbourhood of the Upper Jhelum Canal:--\r\n\r\n  +----------+------------------+---------+\r\n  |Catchment |   Discharge per  | Run-off.|\r\n  |  Area.   |    square mile.  |         |\r\n  +----------+------------------+---------+\r\n  |Sq. miles.| Cub. ft. per sec.| Inches. |\r\n  |          |                  |         |\r\n  |   .79    |        5000      |   7·8   |\r\n  |  1·47    |        3825      |   5·82  |\r\n  |  2·96    |        2214      |   3·46  |\r\n  +----------+------------------+---------+\r\n\r\nIn the south-east of New South Wales flood discharges of 135 and 84\r\ncubic feet per second have been found for catchment areas of ·91 and\r\n2·5 square miles respectively in broken country.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Rivers.=--It is possible to apply the methods of the preceding\r\narticle to large catchment areas, but the results would be quite\r\nunreliable. If the calculations were made so as to err on the side of\r\nsafety, the resulting discharges would often be enormous. The following\r\ntable shows some figures based on actual flood discharges. None of\r\nthe localities have excessive rainfalls, though most are liable to\r\noccasional very heavy falls. In mountainous districts in the North\r\nof England and in Scotland the flood discharges per square mile of\r\ncatchment area have been found to vary from 64 to 320 cubic feet per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n  +-----------+---------+-----------+---------+---------------+----------+\r\n  |           |         |           |         |Flood Discharge|          |\r\n  | Reference |Country. | Locality. |Catchment| per sq. mile  | Remarks. |        |\r\n  |  Number.  |         |           |  Area.  | of Catchment  |          |\r\n  |           |         |           |         |  Area.        |          |\r\n  +-----------+---------+-----------+---------+---------------+----------+\r\n  |           |         |           |Sq. miles|   Cub. ft.    |          |\r\n  |           |         |           |         |   per sec.    |          |\r\n  |      1    |  India. |  Upper    | 5 to 10 |     1613      |          |\r\n  |           |         | Jhelum.   |         |               |          |\r\n  |      2    |    ”    | Nagpur.   |    6·6  |      480      |          |\r\n  |      3    |  South  |Near Cape  |   34·5  |       78      |          |\r\n  |           | Africa. | Town.     |         |               |          |\r\n  |           |         |           |         |               |          |\r\n  |      4    |    ”    |Near Port  |   35    |      640      |Estimated.|\r\n  |           |         |Elizabeth  |         |               |          |\r\n  |      5    |New South|South-East |   49    |       37      |          |\r\n  |           |  Wales. | District. |         |               |          |\r\n  |      6    |  India. |  Upper    |   56    |     1000      |          |\r\n  |           |         | Jhelum.   |         |               |          |\r\n  |      7    |    ”    |    ”      |  174    |      550      |          |\r\n  |      8    |New South|South-East |  418    |       11·2    |          |\r\n  |           |  Wales. |District.  |         |               |          |\r\n  |      9    |  India. |Kali Nadi  | 2593    |       51      |Estimated |\r\n  |           |         |  Stream.  |         |     or more   |roughly.  |\r\n  +-----------+---------+-----------+---------+---------------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the figures in column 5 of the table is to decrease as\r\nthe catchment area increases. This tendency has long been known, and\r\nattempts have been made to found on it formulæ for calculating flood\r\ndischarges. One such formula is Q = _c_ M^{3/4} where Q is the flood\r\ndischarge in cubic feet per second and M is the area of the catchment\r\nin square miles. The formula is roughly correct, _c_ being a constant\r\nfor catchment areas of not dissimilar characters and with rainfalls\r\nnot differing much. But for other cases there is no knowing how _c_\r\nmay vary, and this renders the formula practically useless. The author\r\nof another such formula quotes cases Nos. 5 and 8 in the above table,\r\nand the two cases mentioned at the end of _Art. 2_ as agreeing fairly\r\nwell with the result of his formula. The tendency just mentioned is\r\ndue to the fact that every river is composed of tributaries which have\r\ntheir own small catchment areas but are, when measured to the general\r\noutlet or point where the discharge is under consideration, of very\r\ndifferent lengths, to the improbability of heavy rainfall occurring\r\nover all these small areas at such times as to cause the different\r\nflood waves to arrive simultaneously at the outlet, and to the facts\r\nthat in the case of the longer tributaries the flood waves flatten\r\nout (_Hydraulics_, CHAP. IX., _Arts. 3_ and _4_) so as to arrive more\r\ngradually, and that, unless rain is also falling all along their\r\ncourses, these longer tributaries undergo losses from evaporation and\r\nabsorption. But occasionally it happens that the various flood waves\r\ndo arrive at the outlet more or less simultaneously, and that the\r\nrainfall continues so long and is so widely distributed--though not\r\nnecessarily of the same intensity as that which caused the flood--that\r\nthe flood waves do not flatten out and that losses in the channels do\r\nnot occur. Floods can thus vary to an extraordinary degree in severity,\r\nand formulæ are quite useless. This is why floods occur surpassing all\r\nprevious records, as, for instance, the recent floods in Paris. However\r\nsevere a flood may be, it can never be said that the maximum has, even\r\nprobably, been attained unless it can be shown that the rainfall has\r\nbeen so heavy, so long continued, and so distributed that anything\r\nworse is not likely to occur.\r\n\r\nThe best method of estimating the flood discharge of a large perennial\r\nstream is to ascertain, by local inquiry, the height to which it is\r\nknown to have risen, and to take cross-sections of the channel and\r\ncalculate the discharge (CHAP. III., _Arts. 4_ and _5_). In designing\r\nworks, allowance can be made for a flood exceeding any known before.\r\nThis method applies also to a case in which a river is formed by the\r\njunction of two or more large tributaries. It is possible that the\r\ntributaries have not, within the memory of man, been in high flood\r\nsimultaneously. If so, the chances of this occurring are no greater and\r\nno less than if the stream was composed merely of a number of small\r\naffluents. Remarks regarding intermittent streams are given in CHAP.\r\nIII., _Art. 7_.\r\n\r\nSince an acre contains 43,560 square feet, and a twelfth of this is\r\n3630, it follows that a fall of 4 inches of rain, of which 1 inch runs\r\noff, in an hour, gives a discharge of 3630 cubic feet per hour, or\r\nabout 1 cubic foot per second. This is 640 cubic feet per second for a\r\nsquare mile. The figures in column 5 of the above table show that the\r\nrun-off was, in the cases quoted, generally far less than 1 inch. In\r\ncase No. 4 it was 1 inch, and in case No. 2 it was 3/4 inch.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Kali Nadi (No. 9 in the table) an aqueduct to carry\r\nthe Lower Ganges Canal over the stream was being designed. The flood\r\ndischarge, estimated from the supposed flood-level and cross-section of\r\nthe stream was (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. xcv.) 26,352 cubic feet\r\nper second. The discharge, estimated by assuming a fall of 6 inches of\r\nrain in twenty-four hours over the catchment area--then believed to\r\nbe 3025 square miles--and a run-off of ·25 of the fall, was 114,950\r\ncubic feet per second. This figure was rejected on the ground that the\r\nrainfall would not be continuous over so large an area as 3025 square\r\nmiles. An allowance of 7 cubic feet per second per square mile was made\r\nand, a fresh survey having shown that the catchment area was only 2593\r\nsquare miles, a discharge of 18,000 cubic feet per second was allowed\r\nfor. The aqueduct was built, about the year 1875, with five arched\r\nspans of 35 feet each, the total area of the waterway being about 3000\r\nsquare feet. The length of the piers and abutments was 212 feet, the\r\nwidth of the canal carried over the aqueduct being 192 feet. In 1884\r\nthe aqueduct was partly destroyed by a flood whose discharge was about\r\n44,000 cubic feet per second. In July 1885 it was wholly destroyed\r\nby a flood whose discharge was estimated at 132,475 cubic feet per\r\nsecond, but was probably more. The discharge must have been more than\r\n51 cubic feet per second per square mile. The aqueduct was rebuilt with\r\na waterway of about 15,000 square feet. Below the aqueduct there was a\r\nbridge which had been standing for a hundred years. Its waterway was\r\nonly 1146 square feet. It was not much damaged by the flood of 1884,\r\nbut much of the water passed round it, breaking through the embanked\r\nroadway or pouring over it. It is understood that the bridge was\r\ndestroyed by the flood of 1885.\r\n\r\nThis case shows the necessity for making every possible allowance in\r\ncalculating flood discharges for important works. The smallness of\r\nthe discharge, as calculated from the cross-section of the stream,\r\nwas probably owing to its being dry when the survey was made, so that\r\nthe velocity could not be observed, but it is probable that such a\r\ndischarge as wrecked the aqueduct had never before passed down the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Prediction of Floods.=--At any place high up on the course of a\r\nstream, the occurrence of a flood can often be predicted when rain\r\nstorms--often accompanied in the tropics by lightning--can be seen to\r\nbe occurring towards the sources of the stream. For any station lower\r\ndown the stream and for precise information in any case, the readings\r\nof gauges higher up the stream can be telegraphed. If the station is at\r\na great distance from the gauge and if there is railway communication,\r\nthe readings can be sent by post.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to predict the time of the arrival of a flood at\r\nthe lower station the reading of a gauge there, and also of that at the\r\nupper station, should be taken at frequent intervals. In the case of\r\nlarge rivers and distances of hundreds of miles, the interval may be\r\nsix or even twelve hours, but in other cases it should be much less.\r\nIf the readings are plotted, as in fig. 56, oblique lines can be drawn\r\nto connect the saliences and depressions, and the time taken by each\r\nchange can thus be readily seen. When the upper part of the stream is\r\nformed by two or more important tributaries there should be a gauge in\r\neach.\r\n\r\nAs to what constitutes a flood, the gauge diagram of a river (fig.\r\n56) is generally such that a line can be sketched as shown dotted.\r\nThe rises above this line are floods. The maximum flood discharge of\r\na Northern Indian river is estimated roughly as being 100 times the\r\nlow-water discharge. Leslie’s rule for floods in the British Isles\r\nis that if all the daily discharges of a stream during the year are\r\nranged in order of magnitude, the discharges of the upper quarter are\r\nconsidered to be floods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.]\r\n\r\nIn India it is sometimes arranged that a telegram shall, in the\r\nlow-water stage of the river, be sent from the upper station when a\r\nrise of 2 feet occurs in twenty-four hours or any less period, with\r\na further telegram for any such subsequent rise. The telegram states\r\nthe exact reading on the gauge and whether the water is rising steady\r\nor falling. This is given as indicating the procedure that may be\r\nfollowed where the telegraph has to be used, but when long and frequent\r\ntelegrams are not desirable.\r\n\r\nThe advancing end of a flood wave may, while the wave is rising and\r\nbeing formed, travel rapidly, but when the wave has been formed it\r\ntravels at the ordinary rate of flow of the risen stream. The advancing\r\nend of a trough may, while it is being formed, travel rapidly, but\r\nafter formation it travels at the ordinary rate of the fallen stream\r\n(_Hydraulics_, CHAP. IX., _Arts. 3_ and _4_). Thus the rate at which\r\na change in water-level travels down a stream depends at first on the\r\namount of the rise or fall, but afterwards on the water-level of the\r\nrisen or fallen stream.\r\n\r\nBy taking the above facts into consideration and noting the actual\r\ntimes obtained from the diagram, it will be possible to arrive at\r\nthe probable time that will be taken by any change. It will also be\r\npossible to predict the height of the flood. If it is worth while, an\r\nempirical formula can be got out. If there are tributaries, each with\r\na gauge, the matter will be more difficult. Probably the floods in the\r\ntributaries will arrive at different times, but even in such cases\r\nempirical formulæ have been arrived at, especially in France, and are\r\nmentioned in various volumes of the Proceedings of the Institution of\r\nCivil Engineers.\r\n\r\nIn all cases predictions are liable to be more or less upset if rain\r\nfalls in the tract between the upper and lower gauges. In very dry\r\nweather the speed of a flood wave may be somewhat reduced, and the\r\nheight to which it rises will almost certainly be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe full effect of a change will not be felt at the lower station\r\nunless the change at the upper station is maintained for a sufficiently\r\nlong period. A short wave or trough flattens out. Thus in any empirical\r\nformula or system of prediction, the time over which the change extends\r\nat the upper gauge must be taken into account, or else there must be\r\nseveral upper gauges and the readings of all of them be taken into\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIn mountainous districts landslips sometimes occur and block the\r\nvalley of a stream which then forms a lake. The water gradually rises\r\nand eventually flows over the dam and sweeps it away causing a flood,\r\nwhich is of great suddenness and height but decreases very quickly\r\nin height as it travels down the valley. In a case which occurred in\r\nthe Himalayas in 1888 the inhabitants of the valleys, from the dam to\r\nthe point where the river debouches from the hills, were compelled by\r\nGovernment to vacate all habitations below the probable level of the\r\nflood, and no loss of life occurred. Similar floods, but on a smaller\r\nscale, may be caused by the bursting of ordinary reservoir dams. In\r\nsome continental rivers ice may obstruct the stream and cause floods.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Prevention of Floods.=--The extended use of field drains has, in\r\nrecent years, done much to increase the severity of floods in England\r\nand other countries. One method of mitigating or preventing floods\r\nis the construction of reservoirs for storing the water. Reservoirs\r\nlocally known as “washes,” formed by setting back the embankments,\r\nexist on the Fen rivers. One wash, on the Nene, below Peterborough, is\r\n12 miles long and half a mile wide and is filled, in floods, to a depth\r\nof 7 feet and holds 1 inch of rainfall over the river basin, and this\r\nis found to be sufficient. Reservoir construction is, however, in most\r\ncases, impracticable owing to the expense. To store the water which is\r\ngiven by 1 inch of rain in the basin of the Thames, a reservoir would\r\nbe needed 50 feet deep and covering about 7 square miles. It might cost\r\n£7,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe afforestation or reforestation of river basins (CHAP. II.,\r\n_Art. 4_) is also occasionally undertaken, but is not generally\r\npracticable.[20]\r\n\r\nThe most practicable methods for preventing flooding are lowering the\r\nwater-level of the stream and constructing embankments along it. These\r\nwill be considered in the next two articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =Lowering the Water-Level.=--The water-level of a given length of\r\nstream can be lowered by lowering the bed, widening the channel or\r\nstraightening the channel. The efficiency of these processes is in\r\nthe order named. As stated in CHAP. I., _Art. 4_, the alteration to\r\nthe channel must in any case be continued to some point downstream of\r\nthe reach under consideration. Let the channel be supposed to be of\r\n“shallow” section with sloping sides. Let W be the mean width, D the\r\ndepth, and S the slope. Let it be required to lower the water-level by\r\nan amount equal to D/5. This can be effected by lowering the bed by\r\nabout 25 per cent. of D, or by increasing the width by about 50 per\r\ncent., or by increasing the slope by about 100 per cent. If the bed is\r\nlowered, V is not affected, and the mean width is reduced. Increase\r\nin W reduces D, and therefore reduces the hydraulic radius and the\r\nvelocity. Hence the large amount of widening necessary. When S is\r\nincreased the velocity, if R remains the same, is affected only as √S\r\n(_Hydraulics_, CHAP. VI., _Art. 2_), but the depth of water is reduced\r\nand R therefore reduced. Dressing the sides of a channel, so as to make\r\nit smoother, produces the same effect as a slight widening.\r\n\r\nIt does not, of course, follow that lowering the bed is always the\r\nbest plan and straightening the worst. Any one of the processes may be\r\nmore or less impracticable because, for instance, of the hardness of\r\nthe material to be removed, or the expense--including compensation--of\r\nremoving obstructions.\r\n\r\nA particular kind of widening consists in digging a new channel and\r\nkeeping both the new and the old channel open.\r\n\r\nIf a channel contains a weir, or a local raised portion of bed forming\r\na kind of submerged weir, or a contracted place or narrow bridge, the\r\nupstream water-level can be lowered by simply removing or reducing the\r\nobstruction. The lowering of the water-level will be greatest at the\r\nsite of the obstruction, and will be zero at some point far upstream\r\n(_Hydraulics_, CHAP. VII., _Art. 5_). If the raised portion forms a\r\nlong shoal, its removal--supposing its height above the general bed to\r\nbe the same--will have more effect than if it were short. If the height\r\nof the raised portion is small compared to the depth of water, or the\r\namount of contraction small compared to the width of the stream, the\r\nremoval may have much less effect than might appear (CHAP. I., _Art.\r\n4_).\r\n\r\nIn soft soils one advantage of the straightening system for lowering\r\nthe water-level is that short-cuts can be dug to a small section, and\r\nleft to enlarge themselves (CHAP. VII., _Art. 1_).\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is that after any diversions have enlarged themselves\r\nto the size of the rest of the channel--or have originally been so\r\nexcavated--the whole channel may scour, and the water-level continue to\r\nfall. This, of course, should be allowed for if likely to occur.\r\n\r\nThe same thing may occur in the case of the removal of a weir, shoal,\r\nor contracted piece of channel. The scour will act at first close to\r\nthe site of the obstruction, but it may work upstream.\r\n\r\nIn widening or deepening a channel for the purpose of mitigating\r\nfloods, it is a good plan to begin work at the downstream end, because\r\nthe lowering of the water-level will extend upstream beyond the reach\r\nin which work is done, and this may facilitate work further upstream.\r\nAs regards any tendency for a widened reach to silt up again, any such\r\nsilting is not likely to be great in a short period of time, and need\r\nnot prevent the carrying on of work in various reaches, if this is\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. =Flood Embankments.=--A flood embankment may be close to the edge\r\nof the river or it may be set back. If set back it need not follow all\r\nthe windings of the stream. The setting back of an embankment gives\r\nan increased waterway to the stream during floods, and therefore a\r\nlower flood-level, but the effect of this is trifling in cases where\r\nthe depth of the water on the flooded land is small, especially if\r\nsuch land is covered with vegetation, or is otherwise much obstructed.\r\nSetting back is generally necessary in cases where the stream is\r\nliable to erode the banks to any considerable extent. In such a case\r\nthe embankment should not be so near to the river as to be in much\r\ndanger from erosion, but the ground, as already stated (CHAP. IV.,\r\n_Art. 9_), generally falls, in going away from the river, so that when\r\nan embankment is set well back it is in lower ground, more expensive\r\nand more liable to breach. The most suitable alignment is a matter\r\nof judgment, and depends largely on the extent to which the river is\r\nlikely to shift.\r\n\r\nEmbankments should, where possible, be made in straight or properly\r\ncurved reaches. A flood embankment, at least at its upstream end,\r\nshould terminate in ground which is above flood-level. The top of an\r\nembankment should be, in the case of a large river, 2 or 3 feet above\r\nthe high flood-level of the river. It should, of course, be graded\r\nparallel to the general high flood-level, but neither the gradient nor\r\nthe height of the flood is usually known with accuracy (CHAP. II.,\r\n_Arts. 1_ and _2_). There is generally a record or mark of some high\r\nflood, and this is taken provisionally as the flood-level. Or the level\r\nis calculated approximately from the flood readings on the nearest\r\nriver gauge. If experience shows that the embankment is too low, it\r\nis raised. The cross-section of an embankment depends on the soil, on\r\nthe extent of damage which results if a breach occurs, on the funds\r\navailable, and on the value of the land which the embankment has to\r\noccupy.\r\n\r\nWhere an affluent enters the river it will probably be necessary to run\r\nout branch embankments. Sometimes cross embankments are run from the\r\nmain embankment to high land. Their object is to localise the damage if\r\na breach occurs. Along the back of the embankment there may be a drain\r\nand it can be made to discharge its water, when the river is not in\r\nflood, through the embankment by means of sluices or by pipes closed\r\nby flap valves which will not allow flood water from the river to pass\r\nthrough. There may be sluices in the embankment for the purpose of\r\nirrigating the land at the back.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the construction of flood embankments along a\r\nriver is to raise the water-level, because the floods can no longer\r\nspread out over the country, but this effect will not be great if the\r\nsectional area of the flood water was small or its velocity low. The\r\nriver may or may not tend, after the construction of flood embankments,\r\nto raise or lower its bed. It has already been remarked that questions\r\nof silting or scouring cannot be answered in a general manner. In the\r\ncase, however, of floods spilling over a piece of country, the depth\r\nof the flood water is generally small and the country more or less\r\nobstructed. Some deposit of silt generally occurs. The construction of\r\nan embankment reduces the area of the flood water, and thus generally\r\nreduces the silting and leaves more silt in the river proper. The depth\r\nand velocity in the river are increased. Everything depends on which\r\nis increased most. Most likely the stream is of shallow section and\r\nthe velocity is increased most (CHAP. IV., _Art. 6_, par. 6), and the\r\nincreased silt-supporting power may make up for the increased charge of\r\nsilt.\r\n\r\nSometimes when a main embankment is set far back, a subsidiary\r\nembankment of smaller section is constructed closer to the stream. This\r\nis often objectionable. The smaller embankment is liable to breach, and\r\nthe water then rises suddenly instead of gradually against the main\r\nembankment, which is thus endangered to some extent, especially as it\r\nis dry instead of being soaked.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that one effect of embanking a reach of a river is\r\nto increase the severity of floods further downstream. The importance\r\nof this is generally exaggerated. The narrowing of the flood stream\r\nin the embanked portion causes the flood to travel more quickly and\r\nrise higher in that particular reach. At a place further downstream\r\nthe same effect is produced, but in a less degree and only because\r\nof the increased velocity and consequent reduction in the flattening\r\nout of the flood wave, especially when the rise is soon succeeded\r\nby a fall. When there is a gradual rise lasting for a considerable\r\ntime--and this is most likely to cause a high flood--there is no rise\r\nof the flood-level downstream of the embanked reach, except such as is\r\ndue to the increase in the discharge of the stream consequent on the\r\nabsorption and evaporation being less than before, owing to the reduced\r\narea of flooding in the embanked reach. In the case of a long-continued\r\nrise, such as that just mentioned, it is the reach immediately upstream\r\nof the embanked reach which will, to some extent, share in the\r\nincreased height of the floods.\r\n\r\nAn embankment may suitably have side slopes of 4 to 1 on the river\r\nside and 3 to 1 on the land side, with a top 10 feet wide and 3 feet\r\nabove high flood-level. On the Irrawaddy the top width is generally 8\r\nfeet. For very high and very low embankments it is 10 feet and 3 feet\r\nrespectively. In Holland 1 foot above high flood-level was at one time\r\nsupposed to be the rule, but in practice it was usually 4 feet. With\r\nsandy soil the riverward slope prescribed was 6 to 1. Such flat slopes\r\nare not necessary if fascining or stiff soil is used as a protection.\r\nOn the Rhine the top width of embankments consisting of gravel and sand\r\nhas been made about 15 feet, but the side slopes were 1½ to 1 and 1 to\r\n1. The embankments had spurs to keep off the current.\r\n\r\nSand, protected as above, makes a good embankment, and rats do not\r\nburrow into it. Of course, if a breach occurs in an embankment\r\nconsisting mainly of sand, it will enlarge very quickly. In some cases\r\nan embankment has a core wall of sand or of clay puddle. In Holland,\r\non sandy soil, a trench 8 feet wide is made and taken down to the clay.\r\n\r\nEmbankments require to be made with great care. The earth should be\r\ndeposited in layers. In Holland, horses are driven up and down over\r\neach layer. In some parts of India the earth for embankments is brought\r\nfrom the borrow pits by scoops drawn by bullocks. The earthwork is of\r\nso excellent a character, owing to the earth being trodden down, that\r\nno settlement has to be allowed for. Where the soil is sand the top\r\nand faces of the embankment should be of good stiff soil, if it can be\r\nobtained, for a thickness of 9 inches or a foot, or else the face next\r\nthe river should be protected by fascining (CHAP. VI., _Art. 3_) for 2\r\nfeet above, and several feet below high flood-level. Such protection\r\nmay be necessary in any case where waves are liable to occur. In\r\nHolland embankments are turfed, and trees and shrubs are not allowed to\r\ngrow. In the Punjab the growth of all kinds of jungle is encouraged. It\r\nbinds the soil together and protects it from the wash of waves and from\r\nwinds which blow away sand and dust, and so wear the embankment slowly\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIn embanking a long reach of a river it is convenient to begin from\r\nthe upstream end, because otherwise floods may get behind the finished\r\npart of the embankment and, becoming impounded in a “pocket” formed by\r\nthe embankment and high land, rise to an abnormal height and, unless\r\ngaps in the embankment have been left or are subsequently made, cause\r\nbreaches.\r\n\r\nDuring high floods pegs should be driven in at frequent intervals,\r\nto mark the high flood-levels. If a higher flood occurs, the peg is\r\nshifted. The levels of the pegs can be observed at leisure.\r\n\r\nWhen a breach occurs in an embankment, the first thing to do is to\r\nprotect the ends so that the breach shall not lengthen. If the water\r\npassing through a breach becomes pocketed, the embankment may have to\r\nbe cut to let it out.\r\n\r\nRegarding the stoppage of leakages, see CHAP. IX., _Art. 1._ Regarding\r\nthe closure of breaches, see CHAP. VII., _Art. 2_.\r\n\r\nFor a description of flood embankments along the great shifting rivers\r\nof Northern India, see _Punjab Rivers and Works_.\r\n\r\n    _Note to Art. 5._--Floods can sometimes be mitigated by sinking\r\n    pits in the flooded area so that the flood water comes in contact\r\n    with permeable strata and is absorbed by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nRESERVOIRS AND DAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Reservoirs.=--The object of a reservoir is to store water for\r\ntown supply or for irrigation or other purposes. Reservoirs for the\r\nwater supply of towns are divided into “impounding reservoirs” and\r\n“service reservoirs,” the latter being of comparatively small size,\r\nand their object being to store, near to the town, a supply sufficient\r\nfor a short period. Instead of one impounding reservoir there may be\r\nseveral, formed by various dams and one discharging into another. When\r\na reservoir is mentioned without qualification, an impounding reservoir\r\nis meant. A reservoir is generally made by blocking up a valley by\r\nmeans of a dam of earth or masonry. The site of the dam should be\r\nselected at a place where the valley is narrow. The lowest portion or\r\n“bottom water” of a reservoir is usually not drawn upon, because it is\r\nless pure than the rest, and it has to be left, in dry weather, for the\r\nfish. It is not included in calculating the capacity of the reservoir.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, when the water of a stream is impounded,\r\n“compensation water” has to be given back to the stream lower down.\r\nThis compensation water is generally given in the form of a constant\r\nsupply, and amounts to perhaps a quarter of the available supply. It\r\nhas to be included in calculating the daily supply taken out of the\r\nreservoir. The advantage to the stream in having this addition to it\r\nduring dry weather is very great.\r\n\r\nIt has already been seen (CHAP. IX., _Art. 1_) that in an earthen bank\r\nwhich has to retain water the leakage generally decreases rapidly and\r\nthe bank becomes almost impermeable. The same is true of the surface of\r\na valley, in the case of most ordinary soils, provided that it is kept\r\nsubmerged. Any portions which become exposed to the sun and weather are\r\nlikely to crack and give rise to percolation. Thus a reservoir formed\r\nby the construction of a dam resting on the surface of the ground may\r\nbe more or less water-tight according to circumstances. There are many\r\nwhich are sufficiently water-tight. But in most cases the dam--or an\r\nimpervious core-wall--is carried down to an impervious stratum. A\r\nmasonry dam is carried down to rock.\r\n\r\nIn the case of dams of considerable height the soil should be examined\r\nby borings. If there is an inclined stratum not well connected with\r\nthat below it, unequal settlement of the dam may occur; and this\r\nmay also happen if there is a thick stratum of clay, owing to its\r\ncompressibility.\r\n\r\nExcept for very high dams--those, for instance, more than 110 or\r\n120 feet in height measured from the ground to the water-level--an\r\nearthen dam is cheaper than a masonry dam. It is also more easily\r\nraised and strengthened--though this operation has also been effected\r\non masonry dams--in case, for instance, of the silting up of the\r\nreservoir, a process which is slow in England, but not so slow when\r\nwater containing much silt is dealt with, as in the case of irrigation\r\nreservoirs in India. Sometimes a dam consists of a wall of masonry\r\nor concrete with earth behind it as a support. Whatever kind of dam\r\nis used, its construction always demands very great care. Serious\r\ndisasters, with much loss of life, have occurred owing to failures of\r\ndams.\r\n\r\nA reservoir with an earthen dam is provided with a waste weir for the\r\npurpose of passing off flood water, which might otherwise overtop the\r\ndam and destroy it. Generally the waste weir is a continuation of the\r\nline of the dam. Its crest has to be below the high-water level of\r\nthe reservoir, but not lower than can be helped, and its length has\r\ntherefore to be considerable. Sometimes it is provided with grooved\r\npiers between which planks are placed in the season when floods are not\r\nlikely to occur.\r\n\r\nIn connection with irrigation reservoirs in Western India, it has been\r\npointed out by Strange (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. cxxxii.) that\r\na long high-level waste weir is best suited to cases in which the\r\nreplenishment of the reservoir is uncertain, and that in cases where\r\nit is nearly certain, the high-level weir prevents the water-level in\r\nthe reservoir being quickly lowered in the case of an accident or for\r\nthe purpose of effecting repairs, impounds the earliest floods, which\r\nare most charged with silt, and causes the water area to be a maximum,\r\nand therefore gives all floods the maximum time in which to deposit\r\nsilt. He accordingly suggests that the crests of waste weirs in these\r\nreservoirs should be shortened and lowered and provided with falling\r\nshutters (this had been done in one reservoir and has since been done\r\nin another), and that sluices be added with sills at a still lower\r\nlevel than the lowered crest. These proposals seem to be entirely\r\nreasonable, though of course it would be necessary to have skilled\r\nsupervision over the working of the sluices. Sometimes the waste weir\r\nis made in a separate place, being separated from the dam by a saddle.\r\n\r\nA masonry dam may act as its own waste weir, the flood water flowing\r\nover the crest and down the rear slope; but in cases where heavy floods\r\nare liable to occur it is usual to provide a separate waste weir by\r\ncutting away the side of the gorge either close to the dam or at some\r\nother place.\r\n\r\nWhile a dam is in course of construction arrangements must be made to\r\ndeal with flood water. Generally the construction of some part of the\r\ndam has to be deferred to let the water pass. In the case of a masonry\r\ndam it does not much matter what part is thus deferred provided the\r\nusual procedure of stepping the work back is followed. In the case\r\nof an earthen dam it is best to defer a portion, not in the lowest\r\nground where the dam is highest, but to one side of it, thus allowing\r\nthe highest part of the dam to be brought up continuously. Temporary\r\nembankments and weirs can be constructed to cause the water to traverse\r\nthe desired route without doing damage. Stepping of the earthwork\r\nshould be avoided as far as possible. If it has to be adopted, the\r\nsteps should be small. Sometimes the flood water is conveyed away by\r\nmeans of a “by-wash,” by an entirely different route.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.]\r\n\r\nIn Indian reservoirs the discharge over the waste weir may at times\r\nbe great. The waste weir is sometimes in the position shown in fig.\r\n57, _a e_ being the weir. In such a case a special hydraulic problem\r\narises. In a case where a stream whose velocity is V issues from a\r\nreservoir or takes off at right angles from a larger stream there is\r\n(_Hydraulics_, CHAP. II., _Arts. 19_ and _20_) a fall in the water of\r\nabout V^2/2_g_. The same thing occurs downstream of a weir, at least\r\nwhen there is a clear fall which is vertical or nearly so, so that the\r\nwater after falling has no horizontal velocity. The water has to be\r\nstarted afresh on its course. In the case represented by the figure,\r\nthe width of the channel is often restricted because of high ground\r\nbeyond _f_, and the velocity in the channel may be very high. Suppose\r\nthe channel below _e f_ to be of brickwork with vertical sides, and\r\nto have a 20-foot bed, a slope of 1 in 500, and a depth of water of\r\n10 feet. The velocity may be 15 feet per second, and V^2/2_g_ is 3·49\r\nfeet. If the water has a clear fall over the weir at _e_, allowance\r\nmust be made for a depth of water of 13·49 feet, not 10 feet, in the\r\nchannel at _e_. Ordinarily the length _a e_ will be much greater,\r\nrelatively to _e f_, than shown in the figure. Suppose that _a e_ is\r\n300 feet and that the slope of the floor of the channel is carried on\r\nat 1 in 500 from _e f_ up to _a_, _b_, _c_, and _d_, following in each\r\ncase the lines marked on the figure which represent the directions of\r\nflow. The length _f a_ will be about 310 feet, and the floor level\r\nat _a_ will be about ·62 feet higher than at _e f_. The water-levels\r\nbelow the weir will be in each case 13·49 feet above the floor. This\r\nshould be allowed for in the design. It is true that the stream on\r\nfirst starting into horizontal motion below the weir moves more or\r\nless at right angles to it, and has thus a large sectional area and a\r\nlow velocity; but it very soon has to turn parallel to the weir and\r\nacquire the full velocity of 15 feet per second, and there must be the\r\nrequisite extra head to give this velocity. If the weir is drowned, the\r\nwater on passing over it may have a high horizontal velocity, but it\r\nwill be at right angles to the axis of the channel, and its effect will\r\nbe wasted in eddies.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Capacity of Reservoirs.=--A reservoir depends for its supply on\r\nthe yield of a particular valley or valleys which form its catchment\r\narea, and the capacity of the reservoir or reservoirs can be altered\r\nby altering the height or number of the dams. The need for a reservoir\r\nis entirely owing to the inequality in the distribution of the\r\nrainfall. If the rain fell in equal quantities week by week, the daily\r\nfluctuations could probably be equalised by the service reservoirs. The\r\nimpounding reservoir could be quite small. Actually, a reservoir is\r\nneeded to “equalise” the flow--that is, to give a steady flow for an\r\nintermittent one. The smaller the reservoir, the sooner it will go dry\r\nin a drought and the sooner it will overflow in wet weather and cause\r\nwaste of the water. In other words, the larger the reservoir the better\r\nit will fulfil its function of equalising the flow and the greater the\r\ndegree to which the catchment area will be utilised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.]\r\n\r\nIn the British Isles the distribution of the rainfall which is most\r\ntrying for a reservoir, occurs when the rain is heavy during the winter\r\nand very light in summer. Fig. 58 shows a diagram for a reservoir\r\nin the driest year, when the rainfall is (CHAP. II., _Art. 1_) ·63\r\nof the mean annual fall. The distribution of the fall is supposed\r\nto be unfavourable as just described. The lower part of the figure\r\nshows the water-level at the end of each month, the reservoir being\r\nsupposed to have vertical sides so that the quantity of water in it is\r\nproportional to the depth of water. The upper part of the figure shows\r\nthe water impounded (available fall multiplied by area of catchment)\r\nin full lines, and the consumption in a dotted line. The distance\r\nbetween the two lines in any month is the same as the rise or fall of\r\nthe reservoir in that month. There is supposed to be no overflow, and\r\nthe total consumption of water in the year is equal to the quantity\r\nimpounded in the year, so that the levels of the reservoir water\r\nsurface on 1st January and 31st December, as shown by the horizontal\r\nlines A, B at the left and right of the figure, are the same. Deacon,\r\nwho has investigated the subject, has found (_Ency. Brit._, Tenth\r\nEdition, vol. 33, “Water Supply”) that, in order to satisfy the above\r\nconditions, the capacity of the reservoir must be 30 per cent. of the\r\nwater impounded during the year, or about 110 days’ consumption. On\r\n1st January the reservoir must be about two-thirds full. At the end\r\nof February it is ready to overflow. At the end of August it is just\r\nbecoming dry. The daily consumption is supposed to be steady throughout\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nAs an instance, suppose the catchment area to be 1000 acres, the mean\r\nannual fall 60 inches, with a loss from evaporation and absorption\r\nof 14 inches. The available rainfall of the year is (see last column\r\nof table below) 23·8 inches, or 1·983̇ feet. The water impounded and\r\nconsumed during the year is 1000 × 43,560 × 1·983̇ × 6·25 = 539,962,000\r\ngallons. The reservoir capacity must be 3/10ths of this, or 161,988,600\r\ngallons. This is represented by the height C E. If the mean available\r\nrainfall in January and February is 6·3 inches, or ·525 feet, the\r\nwater impounded during those months is 1000 × 43,560 × ·525 × 6·25 =\r\n143,931,000 gallons, and the consumption is 539,962,000/6 = 89,993,667\r\ngallons. The difference, 53,937,333 gallons, represents the addition\r\nA C, to the reservoir. Similarly, the light summer rainfall causes\r\nthe depletion A E, and the heavy rainfall in the last four months of\r\nthe year the addition E B. If the height of the reservoir above A B\r\nwere less than A C, there would be overflow at the end of February;\r\nand if the depth below A B were less than A E, the reservoir would go\r\ndry before the drought ended. If the capacity of the reservoir were\r\nincreased either at the top or bottom, the cost would be increased and\r\nnothing would be gained. It is not meant that the highest and lowest\r\nlevels of any reservoir designed as above would always, in the driest\r\nyear, exactly correspond with the points of overflow and going dry, but\r\nthey would do so nearly. Deacon states that such a reservoir would fail\r\nonly once in fifty years, and then only for a short time.\r\n\r\nThe reservoir considered above does not, as already remarked, fully\r\nutilise the yield of the catchment area. In a wetter year there\r\nwould be overflow and the yield from the reservoir would not be much\r\nincreased. In order to equalise the flow of the two driest years\r\nthe capacity of the reservoir must be increased, its yield being\r\nalso increased, and so on for larger groups of years. By collecting\r\ninformation for large numbers of places in the British Isles, Deacon\r\nhas prepared diagrams and tables which show the capacities and yields\r\nof reservoirs. The following table gives the figures for the case where\r\nthe rainfall is 60 inches and the loss by evaporation and absorption 14\r\ninches:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+--------+---------+\r\n  | Number of |             |           |Column 2 ÷|        |         |\r\n  |   Driest  | Net Capacity|           | Column 3 |        |         |\r\n  |Consecutive| of Reservoir|           | or Number|Ratio of|         |\r\n  | Years the |    for a    |   Daily   | of Days’ |Rainfall|Available|\r\n  |  Flow of  |  Catchment  | Yield of  |  Supply  |to Mean |Rainfall.|\r\n  |   which   | Area of 100 |Reservoir. | contained| Annual |         |\r\n  |  is to be |   acres.    |           |  in the  | Fall.  |         |\r\n  | Equalised.|             |           |Reservoir.|        |         |\r\n  +-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+--------+---------+\r\n  |           |   Gallons.  |  Gallons. |          |        | Inches. |\r\n  |    1      | 166,000,000 | 1,475,000 |   113    |  ·63   |  23·8   |\r\n  |    2      | 258,000,000 | 1,815,000 |   142    |  ·72   |  29·2   |\r\n  |    3      | 329,000,000 | 1,987,000 |   165    |  ·77   |  32·2   |\r\n  |    4      | 390,000,000 | 2,103,000 |   190    |  ·80   |  34·0   |\r\n  |    5      | 441,000,000 | 2,187,000 |   201    |  ·82   |  35·2   |\r\n  |    6      | 487,000,000 | 2,255,000 |   216    |  ·835  |  36·1   |\r\n  +-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\nThe figures in the fifth column are those given in CHAP. II., _Art.\r\n1_. The figures in the last column show the corresponding available\r\nfalls, after deducting the loss of 14 inches. It will be seen that,\r\nowing to this deduction, the available falls for the shorter periods\r\nare reduced in a greater ratio than the figures in the fifth column.\r\n\r\nIn arranging for the supply of towns in the British Isles it is usual\r\nto design the reservoirs so as to equalise the flow of the three driest\r\nconsecutive years. Existing reservoirs, old and new, usually contain\r\nfrom 140 to 170 days’ supply, but some contain less. The above table\r\nshows that for the assumed fall of 60 inches and loss of 14 inches, the\r\ncapacity of a reservoir, to allow for a six-year dry period, has to be\r\n49 per cent. more than for a three-year dry period, while the daily\r\nsupply from it is only 13 per cent. greater.\r\n\r\nThe following statement gives Deacon’s figures for mean annual\r\nrainfalls ranging from 30 to 100 inches. The columns marked R show the\r\nreservoir capacities in millions of gallons, and those marked S the\r\ndaily yields of the reservoirs in thousands of gallons. The figures\r\nfor other falls can be interpolated. For a fall of, for instance, 50\r\ninches, the figures, whether of R or S, are practically a mean between\r\nthose for falls of 40 and 60 inches.\r\n\r\n  +----------+-----------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n  |  Number  |  F = 30.  |   F = 40.  |  F = 60.   |  F = 100.  |\r\n  | of Years |           |            |            |            |\r\n  |  whose   |           |            |            |            |\r\n  |  Supply  |           |            |            |            |\r\n  |is to be  +-----+-----+-----+------+-----+------+-----+------+\r\n  |Equalised.|  R. |  S. |  R. |  S.  |  R. |  S.  |  R. |  S.  |\r\n  +----------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+------+-----+------+\r\n  |    1     |  35 | 300 |  79 |  695 | 166 | 1475 | 345 | 3040 |\r\n  |    2     |  85 | 470 | 140 |  900 | 258 | 1815 | 495 | 3600 |\r\n  |    3     | 120 | 560 | 190 | 1050 | 329 | 1987 | 610 | 3900 |\r\n  |    4     | 150 | 620 | 230 | 1110 | 390 | 2103 | 710 | 4100 |\r\n  |    5     | 175 | 650 | 260 | 1170 | 441 | 2187 | 800 | 4230 |\r\n  |    6     | 195 | 680 | 290 | 1220 | 487 | 2255 | 887 | 4320 |\r\n  +----------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+------+-----+------+\r\n\r\nIn all cases the loss is supposed to be 14 inches annually. If it is\r\n15 or 13 inches, the reservoir capacity is less or more by about five,\r\nten, or fifteen million gallons, according as the number of years in\r\ncolumn 1 is 1, 3, or 6. And the daily yield is less or more by about\r\n50,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nWith a low rainfall the advantage of a large reservoir is somewhat\r\nincreased. The capacity of the six-year reservoir for a fall of 30\r\ninches is 63 per cent. more than that of the three-year reservoir, but\r\nthe supply is 22 per cent. greater.\r\n\r\nThe figures given above for reservoir capacities are suitable for the\r\nBritish Isles. They assume that the distribution of the rainfall is the\r\nleast favourable that is at all likely to occur. Deacon states that\r\nthe figures do not relieve the engineer of the exercise of judgment.\r\nAs regards the British Isles, the chief questions on which judgment\r\nhas to be exercised are whether to equalise the flow of three years or\r\nof another number, and how much to allow for loss. As already stated,\r\nthree years is the period usually taken. The figures are suitable for\r\nmost places in Europe, but in some places, _e.g._ on the Mediterranean\r\ncoast, the distribution of the rainfall is somewhat less favourable\r\nthan in the British Isles. In other parts of the world, and notably in\r\nor near the tropics, the distribution of the rainfall must be specially\r\nstudied, and a diagram be prepared on the same principle as in the case\r\nof fig. 58. The diagram should be extended to cover the desired number\r\nof years. In hot countries loss by evaporation from the surface of the\r\nreservoir should be allowed for. In India during the hot dry months\r\nthis loss may be half an inch in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIn the article above quoted it is shown that if, as commonly happens,\r\nthe consumption of water is, in summer, greater than the mean, and in\r\nwinter less, the conditions are still more trying for the reservoir;\r\nand that in the case where the summer consumption is 13 per cent.\r\ngreater than the mean, the capacity of the reservoir which impounds the\r\nwater of the driest year must be 33 per cent., instead of 30 per cent.,\r\nof the total supply impounded during the year. It would then contain\r\n121 days’ instead of 110 days’ mean supply. In the table on page 170\r\nthe number of days’ supply is 113. From this it appears that the tables\r\nfrom which extracts have been given are calculated on the basis of a\r\nconstant consumption. This, however, in the case where the number of\r\nyears whose supply is equalised is greater than one, makes, owing to\r\nthe increased size of the reservoir, no practical difference.\r\n\r\nThe calculations for the great reservoirs in Radnorshire for the supply\r\nof the city of Birmingham are as follows (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._,\r\nvol. clxxx.). The ratio of the mean fall in the three driest years to\r\nthe mean annual fall was taken as ·80 instead of ·77. There is some\r\ndifference of opinion as to the best figure:--\r\n\r\n  Mean annual fall determined from readings\r\n    of various gauges                          65 inches\r\n  Mean fall of three driest years              52   ”\r\n  Deduct loss from evaporation and absorption\r\n    and losses during floods                   15   ”\r\n  Available rainfall                           37   ”\r\n\r\nThis multiplied by 44,000 acres, the area of the catchment, gives 102\r\nmillion gallons per day. Of this, 27,000,000 gallons is compensation\r\nwater, leaving 75,000,000 gallons for Birmingham. Capacity of\r\nreservoirs, 17,250,000,000 gallons, or 169 days’ supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Earthen Dams.=--Before an earthen dam is made, any soft soil on the\r\nsite should be removed and the ground downstream of the site should\r\nbe drained. A few trenches, running parallel to the axis of the dam,\r\ncan be dug so as to give the dam a hold, though there is never any\r\ndanger of its being moved horizontally by the thrust of the water.\r\nIf the ground has a side-long slope it should be benched as shown in\r\nfig. 59. The front slope of an earthen dam is generally about 3 to 1,\r\nand the rear slope about 2 to 1. The top has a width of ⅓ to ½ the\r\ngreatest depth of water held up, and is 5 to 10 feet above the highest\r\nwater-level. The borrow pits from which the earth for the dam is got\r\nshould not be near enough to it to in any way affect its stability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.]\r\n\r\nIn England, and generally in other countries, an earthen dam has a\r\ncore-wall (fig. 60) which is carried down to an impervious stratum,\r\nand is keyed into it to a depth of a foot or more in the case of\r\nhard rock and several feet in the case of clay. On this core-wall\r\nthe impermeability of the dam chiefly depends. The core-wall may be\r\nof clay puddle, concrete, or masonry. In England it is generally of\r\nclay puddle. The core-wall sometimes extends down to a depth of 100\r\nor 200 feet. Its top is horizontal and about level with the highest\r\nwater-level. It is desirable not to make the foundation stepped,\r\nbut to let it follow the profile of the impervious stratum. The\r\nwall is keyed at its ends into the sides of the valley or gorge. A\r\ncore-wall of concrete or masonry is, in a high dam, necessarily a\r\ncomparatively thin structure, and it may be subjected to great strains\r\nby unequal pressures of the earth which surrounds it. It is therefore\r\nto some extent liable to crack. A core-wall of concrete used for the\r\nwater-works of Boston, U.S.A., is 100 feet high, 8 feet thick at the\r\nbase, and 4 feet thick at the top. A clay-puddle wall, being plastic\r\nand moist, at least during the period immediately succeeding the\r\nconstruction of the work, is not very liable to crack. The top width\r\nof a puddle wall may be 4 to 10 feet, and the batter of the sides from\r\n1 in 20 to 1 in 8. The clay used for the wall above the ground-level\r\nshould contain about 33 per cent. of sand and stones. This diminishes\r\nits shrinkage if it dries. It should not be given too much water in\r\nmixing. It should be thoroughly mixed and worked up and trodden down.\r\n\r\nThe clay puddle and the earth of the dam should be carried up\r\nuniformly. The allowance for settlement may be 1/30 to 1/50. The earth\r\nshould be deposited in thin layers, moistened and rammed, and all clods\r\nbroken. In India and some other countries, instead of the earth being\r\nrammed, cattle or sheep are driven over it repeatedly. This makes\r\nearthwork of most excellent quality, and the settlement, if any, is\r\nvery small.\r\n\r\nIn cases where, owing to a fissure in the rock below the bottom of the\r\npuddle trench, water comes through under the puddle, it is usual to\r\ncarry it away in a pipe running vertically in a groove up the side of\r\nthe trench and then horizontally till it emerges from the dam. Such\r\nwater, and any other leakage, can often in Great Britain be used as\r\npart of the compensation water. There is, however, a certain chance,\r\nwhen there are water-bearing fissures in the rock below the bottom of\r\nthe trench, that some percolating stream of water may wash away the\r\npuddle, and it is preferable to use a concrete core-wall in such cases,\r\ncarrying it up to about ground-level and keying it into a much thicker\r\nwall of puddle which is carried up to the water-level.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the clay puddle or other impervious layer\r\nshould be placed, not vertically and in the middle of the dam, but\r\nlying on the upstream face of the dam, so as to keep out water from\r\nthe whole dam instead of from only half of it. Objections to this, if\r\nclay puddle is used, are that vermin may bore holes in it, and that,\r\nwith some clays, it would slip. These objections might be overcome to\r\nsome extent by laying a pitching of concrete blocks over the puddle.\r\nOther objections, applying also when masonry or concrete is used, are\r\nthat the superficial area and cost are increased, and that cracks would\r\noccur from settlement of the earth and from changes of temperature when\r\nthe water in the reservoir was low. A good many cases have occurred in\r\nwhich an impervious layer laid on the slopes has failed from one cause\r\nor another. In France it is usual to rely on such a layer--concrete\r\nis used--and to dispense with a core-wall. The practice of having a\r\nvertical wall appears to be the best, and is the most widely adopted.\r\nWhen puddle is used the weight of the mass above it forces it to\r\ncompletely fill the trench, and when once it is in position and covered\r\nup it is not at all likely to be damaged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.]\r\n\r\nThe outer portion of a high embankment sometimes slips (fig. 61), and\r\nprecautions should be taken against this. A slip may occur if the site\r\nof the dam has not been carefully selected as to geological formation,\r\nor if there is unequal settlement owing to the work having been done at\r\ndifferent times. One cause of slips is sudden and partial changes in\r\nthe degree of saturation, and another cause is excessive saturation.\r\nSome clays when wet require extremely flat side slopes, and will\r\nnot stand even at 5 to 1. The outer parts of the embankment are not\r\nrequired for stopping percolation (this will be further considered in\r\nthe following paragraph), and, though they must be carefully laid and\r\nconsolidated, they should be of porous material, and the part on the\r\ndownstream side of the dam must be well drained. A series of surface\r\ndrains may be arranged and filled with loose stone and gravel. There is\r\nalso a distinct advantage in using heavy material such as small stone\r\nfor the lowest portion of the outer parts on both sides of the dam.\r\nWhen good material cannot be obtained, the side slope on the downstream\r\nside of the dam may be flattened. A side slope starting at the top\r\nwith 3 to 1 and becoming 4 to 1 lower down, and finally 5 to 1 at the\r\nbase, is a very good form for prevention of slipping and generally\r\nfor the safety of a dam. The part on the side next the reservoir is\r\nnot likely to slip. It becomes soaked, but it has the pressure of the\r\nwater against it and is pitched. In Madras, where reservoirs are very\r\nnumerous, the slope on the side next the water is generally only 1½ to\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThe different parts of an earthen dam fulfil two distinct functions.\r\nSome parts, which may be called the staunches, have to stop the\r\npercolation of water from the reservoirs. Other parts, which may\r\nbe called the supports, have merely to hold up the staunches. In\r\nthe British type of dam the portion nearest the core-wall on either\r\nside (fig. 60) is generally made of earth specially selected for\r\nimpermeability. The distance to which it extends from the wall depends\r\npartly on the quantity of such earth available. In any case it has to\r\nbe very carefully made and consolidated, to avoid unequal pressures\r\non the core-wall, or unequal settlement which might cause it to part\r\nfrom the wall. One of its functions is to keep the core-wall moist\r\nwhen the water-level in the reservoir falls. Whether it is also to\r\nbe considered as a staunch or a support might at first appear to be\r\nof no consequence, but it is of importance as affecting the question\r\nof drainage. The support on the downstream side of the dam must, as\r\nhas just been seen, be made of porous material and be well drained;\r\nbut obviously a staunch must not be porous, nor can it be penetrated\r\nby drains. The question must be decided in each case according to\r\njudgment. In a discussion which took place on the above-mentioned paper\r\nby Strange, at the Institution of Civil Engineers, much diversity of\r\nopinion was expressed among eminent engineers as to the desirability\r\nof draining the downstream half of the dam, _i.e._ the part downstream\r\nof the core-wall. By some it was urged that drainage is necessary to\r\nlessen the chance of the earthwork slipping. Others contended that any\r\ndrain which penetrates the dam must facilitate the percolation of water\r\nfrom the reservoir. It is clear that some of the speakers regarded\r\nthe dam downstream of the core-wall as being partly staunch, and some\r\nas being wholly support. If for any reason there seems a chance of\r\nwater leaking through the core-wall, it is desirable to regard the\r\nearth-filling next to it as staunch.\r\n\r\nIn Western India a kind of puddle is made by mixing three parts of\r\n“black cotton soil” with two of sand. The object of the puddle wall is\r\nonly to prevent water from finding its way along the surface of the\r\nground. It is carried down only to a fairly water-tight stratum and\r\nis carried up only to 1 foot above the ground. Above that the mass of\r\nthe dam is made of black cotton soil as a staunch, with more porous\r\nmaterial on both sides of it.\r\n\r\nIn order to afford full protection against waves and their splashes,\r\nthe pitching on the upstream face of a dam should extend up to a height\r\nof 5 feet, measured vertically, above the highest water-level. In the\r\ncase of a dam in which the “fetch” or distance over which the waves\r\nhave been in process of formation exceeds two miles, the above height\r\nshould be slightly increased.[21] The pitching is usually of stones\r\nroughly squared at their outer ends and laid on a layer of broken\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThe water from a reservoir is usually drawn off by means of pipes which\r\nare laid inside a masonry culvert built under the dam. The pipes can\r\nthus be inspected. The culvert is blocked at its upstream end by a\r\nthick masonry wall through which the pipes pass. Accidents which have\r\nhappened in the past have been due to weakness of the culvert or to\r\nwater finding its way along the outside of the masonry. The culvert can\r\nbe made of proper strength, and it should have a thick coating of clay\r\npuddle which is worked into the clay-puddle core-wall of the dam. If\r\nthe core-wall is of masonry or concrete, the masonry of the culvert is\r\nproperly joined to it. In many cases the culvert and pipes are taken\r\nthrough a cutting or tunnel and not under the dam.\r\n\r\nAt the upstream end of the culvert there is a masonry tower--access to\r\nit is obtained from the top of the dam by a foot-bridge,--and from it\r\nvalves for opening and closing the pipes are worked. If the reservoir\r\nis for the water supply of a town, it is arranged, by means of a\r\nvertical pipe, that the draw-off can be at various levels so that the\r\nsurface-water can always be used. In the case of some of the towers at\r\nthe reservoirs whence Birmingham is now supplied, the vertical pipe\r\nconsists of a number of steel cylinders with gun-metal faces which are\r\nso accurately made that the joint is water-tight when one cylinder\r\nmerely stands on another. The draw-off is obtained from a given level\r\nby lifting a particular number of cylinders. Sometimes the tower is\r\nmade of reinforced concrete. When it is lofty it should be strong\r\nenough to resist a strong wind, blowing when the reservoir is empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Masonry Dams.=--For heights much exceeding 110 or 120 feet a\r\nmasonry dam may be cheaper than an earthen dam; and in case a flood\r\noccurs while work is in progress the masonry might suffer little\r\ninjury, while earthwork might be swept away completely. Masonry dams\r\nare usually built of random rubble masonry with faces of dressed stone.\r\nSuch masonry weighs about 140 lbs. per cubic foot, and is ordinarily\r\nquite safe when subjected to pressures of 20 tons per square foot, but\r\nin a masonry dam a high factor of safety is necessary, and 15 tons per\r\nsquare foot may be allowed. In a wall of such masonry with both faces\r\nvertical, the pressure, owing to the weight of the wall, will reach the\r\nabove limit when the wall has attained a height of about 220 feet.\r\n\r\nIn a masonry dam, although the masonry is always of the best quality,\r\nit is a rule to calculate the dimensions so as to give no tension on\r\nany part of the masonry. Any crack or opening of a joint, occurring\r\nperhaps before the masonry had hardened, would let in water, and its\r\npressure would tend to gradually extend the crack and eventually to\r\noverturn the portion above the crack.\r\n\r\nFig. 62 shows the upper part of a masonry dam. The lines with arrows\r\nshow the vertical force due to the weight of the masonry above A B, the\r\nhorizontal force due to the water-pressure on it--acting at two-thirds\r\nof the depth,--and the resultant of these two. In order that there may\r\nbe no tension on the masonry, the resultant must always fall within\r\nthe middle third of the thickness of the dam. In order to prevent its\r\nfalling outside the middle third, the downstream face must be splayed\r\nout, and the splay will go on increasing somewhat. Suppose, now, that\r\nthe reservoir is laid dry. It will be found that in the case of a dam\r\nmore than 100 feet high the pressure due to the weight of the wall\r\nalone will fall outside the middle third--to the upstream side of it,\r\nof course--of the thickness of the wall, and a slight splay must be\r\ngiven to the upstream side. The vertical pressure of the water on this\r\nsplayed part must be taken into consideration. The limit of pressure,\r\n15 tons per square foot, may eventually be reached owing to the height\r\nof the dam, and additional splay may have to be given for this. When\r\nthe outside splay becomes considerable a further allowance is made\r\nfor it, because the stress at the edge of a horizontal section is\r\ntangential to the face. In order that the tangential stress may not\r\nexceed 15 tons per square foot, the vertical stress at the outer edge\r\nof a horizontal section of the dam must not exceed about 12 tons. By\r\nfollowing the above rules the section of the dam can be calculated,\r\nbeginning from the top and working downwards. The resulting profile of\r\nthe dam is somewhat as shown in fig. 63. If a masonry dam is designed\r\non the principles given above--that is, so as to be safe as regards\r\ncrushing and overturning--it will be safe as regards shearing or\r\nsliding horizontally, but a test calculation can easily be made for\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.]\r\n\r\nCalculations of the above kind do not, of course, enable all the\r\nstresses in a solid mass of masonry to be found. Great stresses are\r\ncaused by expansion and contraction owing to changes in temperature.\r\nOthers are caused by the connections of the dam with the rock on which\r\nit rests and with the sides of the gorge. The method of calculation\r\ndescribed above indicates a suitable form for the profile of a dam. The\r\nlarge factor of safety adopted allows for other stresses. The sections\r\nof the oldest dams, made in Spain, were somewhat as shown in fig. 64,\r\nand contained about twice as much material as was necessary. The object\r\nof the calculations is to save this needless expenditure.\r\n\r\nMasonry dams designed on the above principles have been constructed for\r\nheights ranging up to nearly 300 feet, measured from the foundation\r\nto the top. The foundation is always on hard rock free from fissures.\r\nGenerally a foundation trench is cut. The ends of the dam are carried\r\ninto the rock on the sides of the gorge. They should not, however,\r\nif the sides of the gorge are steep, be built in with mortar, but be\r\nallowed to expand and contract vertically, a water-tight joint being\r\nmade by means of asphalt (_Ency. Brit._, Tenth Edition, vol. 33, “Water\r\nSupply”). This obviously reduces the straining. A dam should be built\r\nin cool weather, so that any stresses to which it will eventually be\r\nsubjected owing to changes in temperature will be chiefly compressive.\r\nThe upstream face should be as water-tight as possible. There should\r\nnot, however, be too sudden a change in the character of the masonry\r\nfrom the face work to the inside work. If there are any springs, they\r\nmust be carefully connected to pipes and carried outside the dam. No\r\nwater must be permitted to get under or inside the dam, either from\r\nsprings in the sides of the gorge or from the water in the reservoir.\r\nMany existing dams leak slightly where they join the sides of the\r\nvalley, and most have developed some vertical cracks normal to the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.]\r\n\r\nOut of some hundred high masonry dams which have been erected, only\r\nthree are known to have failed. Of these, the Puentes dam was partly\r\nfounded on piles; and in two, the Habra and Bouzey dams, the rule of\r\nthe middle third was not attended to. Another dam, not so high, the\r\nAustin dam, in Texas, U.S.A., failed seven years after construction.\r\nIt was 65 feet high and founded on limestone, the width of the base\r\nbeing 66 feet. Springs in the bed and sides of the gorge had, during\r\nthe construction of the dam, given much trouble, and had, after its\r\ncompletion, forced their way through the underlying rock. At the time\r\nof failure 11 feet of water was passing over the dam, which sheared in\r\ntwo places, a length of 440 feet of it being pushed forward for 40 or\r\n50 feet without overturning, but subsequently breaking up. The dam was\r\nfounded in a trench cut in the rock. The rock on the downstream side of\r\nthe foundation trench appears to have been worn away by the water, so\r\nthat there was no longer a trench (_Scientific American_, 28th April\r\n1900). The above, however, does not seem to be sufficient to account\r\nfor failure. The horizontal water-pressure on a 1-foot length of the\r\ndam would be 180,000 lbs. and the weight of masonry to be moved perhaps\r\n320,000 lbs. It seems probable that water from upstream found its way\r\nunder the dam and exercised a lifting force on it and so caused it to\r\nslide.\r\n\r\nIf a masonry dam, instead of being straight, is made curved on plan,\r\nwith its convexity upstream, it acts as an arch, and its thickness\r\ncan, in the case of a fairly narrow gorge, be greatly reduced. This\r\ntype of dam is a suitable one to use when the sides of the gorge are\r\nof firm and solid rock and there is no doubt about their being able to\r\nstand the thrust without yielding. Several dams of very considerable\r\nsize have recently been built in this way. The thickness of the upper\r\npart of the dam and the ratio of the versed-sine of the arch to the\r\nspan can be decided on by the methods used for arches in general. The\r\nlower part of the dam is made thicker. The lowest part cannot act as\r\nan arch, because it is attached to the foundation. It is, however,\r\nassisted by the portion above it, which acts as an arch, and thus\r\nneed not be so thick as in a “gravity” section. The Bear Valley dam,\r\nwhich is 64 feet high, is only 3 feet thick at the top. The thickness\r\nincreases gradually to 8½ feet at 48 feet from the top. The chord\r\nof the curve is 250 feet and the radius of curvature 335 feet. If\r\nthe gorge is wide, the thickness of the arch comes out so great that\r\nnothing is saved by adopting the curved form. But in such a case, and\r\nin any case, a dam can be made slightly curved so as to offer a greatly\r\nincreased resistance to overturning. It need not act as an arch, and\r\ncan be prevented from so acting, in order that excessive stresses may\r\nbe avoided, by letting the ends of the dam, after they have entered the\r\ngrooves cut in the sides of the gorge, stop short of the ends of the\r\ngrooves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.]\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years much attention has been given to the\r\ninvestigation of the stresses to which a masonry dam is subjected. Some\r\ninvestigations have been theoretical and others practical, models of\r\nindia-rubber and other substances having been used for experiment. The\r\ninvestigations show that generally the stresses in a model of a dam are\r\nvery much the same as would be expected, but that there is a tensile\r\nstress, previously overlooked, near the point M (fig. 65), where the\r\ndam rests on its foundation. The tension is on the foundation, on the\r\nline M N, and is due to the horizontal thrust of the water. It is\r\nnatural that in an elastic model this stress should manifest itself\r\nby deformation. In the case of an actual dam resting on rock, matters\r\nare different; but this tensile stress deserves consideration. For the\r\npresent let it be supposed that there is no trench, the dam merely\r\nstanding on the rock. Suppose that the rock has only the thickness\r\nM R. There is tension in M N, and probably compression in N R. It\r\nis assumed that, along the base M P, there is perfect union between\r\nthe dam and the rock. The tension to which the rock is occasionally\r\nsubjected owing to changes of temperature may exceed any tension due to\r\nthe water-pressure, but it is conceivable that the tension occurring\r\nfrom both causes might cause a crack at M N, and that this might extend\r\nto R. This implies a minute sliding of the dam and of the rock below\r\nit, movement taking place on the plane R Q. The thrust of the water is\r\nnow resisted by the rock downstream of P Q. The dam, with the rock M\r\nR Q P adhering to it, tends to rotate about the point P. The tendency\r\nto rotate will be enhanced if water enters M R, and still more if it\r\nenters R Q. No rotation can, however, take place unless the rock at M\r\nR is splintered away. The rock would also have to fracture at P Q. It\r\nhas been suggested that the upstream face of the dam be made curved\r\nas shown by the dotted line. This would shift the chief tension to _m\r\nn_, and the dam, with the rock beneath it and the weight of the water\r\nabove the curved portion, would obviously offer an increased resistance\r\nto rotation about P. The cost of the dam would of course be increased.\r\nThe danger of a crack forming at M N seems to exist only when there is\r\na thin upper stratum of rock not firmly connected to rock below. When\r\nthis condition is believed to exist, a masonry dam, if built at all,\r\nshould have the upstream face curved as above described. In the case of\r\nany existing dam of great height, when the above condition is suspected\r\nto exist, the reservoir might be laid dry, and if any crack at M N is\r\ndiscovered a curved portion could be added; but in this case the union\r\nbetween the new and the old work would be imperfect, and the curve\r\nshould start from high up on the upstream face of the dam. It has been\r\nsuggested that asphalt or some impervious material be laid on the rock\r\nto prevent water from entering any crack. It would, however, not only\r\nhave to be laid upstream of the dam, but to extend under part of the\r\ndam, and thus weaken it to some extent.\r\n\r\nIn the case (fig. 63) in which the dam is founded in a deep trench,\r\nthe building up of the upstream triangular space and uniting the\r\nmaterial both to the dam and to the side of the trench, might be of\r\nsome use, but a crack might form in it. It would be desirable to add a\r\ncurved portion, as above described, on the top of the rock if sound,\r\nor to remove the unsound rock and widen the trench and then add the\r\ncurved portion. Adding material to the downstream triangular space,\r\nand uniting it well, would also increase the resistance of the dam to\r\noverturning, not so much because of the additional weight, as because\r\nof the raising of the point about which the dam would have to revolve\r\nin overturning.\r\n\r\nSeveral recent dams have been built of cyclopean concrete, blocks\r\nof rock as heavy as 10 tons being sometimes used in the work. Such\r\nblocks are laid on one of their flat faces. In the U.S.A. some\r\nreservoirs have been made with walls of reinforced concrete, backed\r\nby earth embankments (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. clxxxix.), and\r\nalso of cyclopean masonry reinforced with steel rods. Another kind\r\nof dam which has been used in the U.S.A. is the rock-fill dam with a\r\ncore--corresponding to the puddle wall in an earthen dam--of steel\r\nplates riveted together and made water-tight and inserted into the rock\r\nat each side. In the case of the East Canyon Creek Reservoir, Morgan,\r\nUtah, the dam is 110 feet high. The steel plates vary in thickness\r\nfrom 3/8-inch at the bottom to ¼-inch at the top, and are embedded in\r\nasphaltum concrete and rest on a concrete base. The dry-stone work\r\nof the dam is hand-packed on both faces, and also on both sides of\r\nthe core. The rest is thrown in. The upstream face is 1 to 1, and the\r\ndownstream face 2 to 1. The waste weir is at one end of the dam and is\r\ncontinued by a flume, so that the water falls clear of the dam. The\r\noutlet is a tunnel in the rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTIDAL WATERS AND WORKS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Tides.=--The tides or “tidal waves” are caused by the attraction of\r\nthe moon and the sun. The phenomena are complex, and a full discussion\r\nof their causes need not be given here. When the tide rises it is said\r\nto “flow,” and it is called the flood tide; when it falls it is called\r\nthe ebb tide. The period between one tide and the next, _e.g._ from\r\nhigh water to high water, is about twelve hours, twenty-five minutes.\r\nAt a spring tide the range of the tide is greater than usual; at a\r\nneap tide less. Where there are channels, as, for instance, the seas\r\nwhich surround the British Isles, the tidal waves run up them as the\r\ntide rises in the neighbouring ocean, and run back as it falls. At some\r\nplaces, as Southampton, the tide comes in from two directions, and\r\nthere is a double tide. The times and levels of high and low water at\r\nvarious places have been ascertained by observation, and are recorded.\r\nThe levels are, however, liable to be affected by winds. A wind blowing\r\ntowards the shore raises the level of both high and low water; a wind\r\nblowing off shore lowers both levels. A severe storm in the North Sea\r\nhas caused a double tide at London Docks, by accelerating the North Sea\r\ntidal wave.\r\n\r\nIn a funnel-shaped estuary, especially if it faces the direction of the\r\ntidal wave in the sea, the tide in going up the channel increases in\r\nvelocity, and the momentum of the water causes it to rise higher and\r\nhigher as the width decreases. At the upper end of the Bristol Channel\r\nthe range of the tide is double the range in the sea outside the\r\nchannel. The Bay of Fundy is another place where a similar phenomenon\r\noccurs. When a river or estuary is shallow and the range of the tide\r\nis great, so that its rise is rapid, the flood tide in some cases\r\nadvances in the form of a wave or “bore,” causing a sudden rise in the\r\nwater-level and a sudden reversal of the flow of the stream. A bore is\r\nmost pronounced at spring tides. That of the Severn is well known.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a tide running along a coast or up an estuary, the water\r\nof the flood tide, after it has ceased to rise, continues for a short\r\ntime, owing to its momentum, to flow in the same direction as before.\r\nThe same thing happens when the ebb tide ceases to fall. The tide also\r\nacquires special velocity, just as a river does, round any projecting\r\nheadland.\r\n\r\nThe rise and fall of the tide are least rapid near the turns of the\r\ntide. If the time from the beginning to the end of the flow be divided\r\ninto six equal parts, the proportional rise of the water will be\r\napproximately as follows. And similarly with the fall during the ebb.\r\n\r\n  Time             1    2    3    4    5   6\r\n  Rise of water  ·067  ·25  ·5  ·75  ·933  1\r\n\r\nTidal waters are frequently charged, more or less, with silt, obtained\r\nfrom the shore or from shallows near it, either by currents or tidal\r\nwaves sweeping along it, or by the action of ordinary waves. Tidal\r\nwaters flowing up and down the lower portions of rivers render them to\r\nan enormous degree more capable of carrying navigation and, especially\r\nif they become enlarged and form estuaries, more capable of being\r\naltered by training works.\r\n\r\nA tide-gauge is constructed on the same principle as a self-registering\r\nstream-gauge. The rise and fall of the water are reduced, by mechanism,\r\nto a convenient range, and are recorded on a band carried on a drum,\r\nwhich is caused to revolve by clockwork. Another kind, which depends on\r\nthe use of an inverted syphon filled with air and a syphon of mercury,\r\nis described in _Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. clxiv.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Tidal Rivers.=--Let A B (fig. 66) be the surface of the lower part\r\nor mouth of a river, supposed to be of uniform width, and let B be the\r\nmean sea-level. As the tide rises to D the water of the river is headed\r\nup and assumes the line A D. When the tide falls to F there is a draw,\r\nthe river surface taking the line A F. If the rise of the tide B H is\r\nso great that the discharge of the river cannot keep pace with it, so\r\nas to fill up the whole space between A and H to the level of H, there\r\nwill be a flow of sea water from H to some point M, and of river water\r\nfrom A to M. The point M will be lower than A and H. If the tide now\r\nturns and the water-level H begins to fall, there will still be a flow\r\nalong H M. For a brief period it will be due to momentum, but it will\r\ncontinue until, by the rise of the water-level at M and the fall at\r\nH, the surface has assumed the form indicated by the dotted line A N\r\nJ. While this is happening, the point corresponding to M--where the\r\nconcave curve of the upland water meets the convex curve of the tidal\r\nwater--rises higher and shifts seaward. The character of the two curves\r\nremains the same, but they become flatter and the surface N J nearly\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nThus the time of high tide at M is later than at H. It is later for\r\neach point passed in going up the river from H towards A. Eventually a\r\npoint A is reached where there is no tide, that is, no rise or fall.\r\nFar below this point, between A and B, there is a point above which\r\nthere is no upward current but only a slackening of the downstream\r\nflow. At H a diagram showing the rise and fall of the tide is\r\nsymmetrical, at N the rises and falls are less than at H, and the\r\nperiods of their occurrence later. In going up the river the duration\r\nof the flood tide decreases and that of the ebb tide increases. The\r\nflood tide attains its greatest velocity soon after its commencement,\r\nthe ebb tide towards its close. The distances to which the tidal\r\ninfluence extend are of course greater the greater the range of the\r\ntide and the flatter the slope of the river. The discharge of the\r\nriver of course varies. The greater the discharge the more the rise\r\nof the river tends to keep pace with that of the tide and the less\r\nthe distance to which the tidal influence extends. On a longitudinal\r\nsection of the river, the high-water line will be shown as A N H. This\r\nis merely done for convenience. It is never high water at all points\r\nsimultaneously. To show the actual state of affairs at various stages\r\nof the tide, series of lines must be drawn as in fig. 67, where the\r\nfirm lines show the flood, and the dotted lines the ebb tide.\r\n\r\nThe flow in the tidal reach of a river is the same as if the water\r\nwas alternately headed up by a movable weir and then allowed to flow\r\nfreely and be drawn down. If the water carries silt, the tendency for\r\ndeposit to occur is (CHAP. V., _Art. 2_) no greater than if there was\r\nno heading up or drawing down. The tendency depends chiefly on whether\r\nthere is, on the average, any reduction in velocity or increase in\r\ndepth as compared with the non-tidal upstream reach, and whether the\r\nwater in that reach is fully charged with silt. If both the answers are\r\nin the negative, no deposit due to river silt is likely to occur in the\r\ntidal reach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.]\r\n\r\nIf the sea water is charged with silt, it will of course carry silt\r\ninto the river as it flows up, but the whole volume of water which\r\nenters has to flow out again. On the whole, the tendency for silt to be\r\ndeposited in the river is due only to the period of “slack tide” near\r\nthe time when the flow ceases. The tendency is seldom marked.\r\n\r\nIf the sea water carries silt and the river water is clear, the latter\r\nassists of course in removing any deposit--that is, it tends to keep\r\nthe channel clear.\r\n\r\nIf the river channel is soft and if the sea water carries no silt, it\r\nmay, in passing up and down the river, become charged with silt and\r\nreturn to sea still carrying it. It thus has a scouring effect on the\r\nchannel, and may deepen or widen it. If, owing, for instance, to the\r\nflattening of the bed slope in its lower reaches, the river tends to\r\ndeposit its own silt in its tidal reach, the sea water may prevent this\r\ndeposit. Thus, as regards silting in the tidal reach of the river,\r\nthe tidal water of the sea has little prejudicial effect if it is\r\nsilt-laden, and a beneficial effect if it is not. Silt is likely to\r\ndeposit in the tidal reach of a river of uniform width, only in a case\r\nin which the river water carries much silt, and the slope is flat or\r\ncross-section great compared to that of the upper reach.\r\n\r\nSea water is heavier than fresh water by about 2·4 per cent., and this,\r\nto some extent, prevents their mixing. At all stages of the flood tide\r\nthe tendency at the point where the fresh water meets the salt water is\r\nfor the fresh water to accumulate towards the surface and the sea water\r\ntowards the bottom. When the tide begins to flow up the river there\r\nmay be a low-level salt water current moving landward and a high-level\r\nfresh water current moving seaward, but this is quite a temporary state\r\nof affairs. The surface slope is landward, and the water moving seaward\r\nis not moving in obedience to the surface slope. It is only moving as\r\na result of momentum previously acquired. The low-level current may\r\nhave some extra velocity and extra scouring power, but this cannot be\r\nmuch, because the mean landward velocity of the whole stream must,\r\nowing to the internal resistances caused by the two currents, be less\r\nthan it would be if there were not two currents. Moreover, the state of\r\naffairs is temporary. The two kinds of water mix eventually, and their\r\ntemporary separation has no considerable effect on the general tendency\r\nof the river in the tidal reach to scour or to silt.\r\n\r\nA body of water included at any moment between any two cross-sections\r\nof the tidal portion of a river may not reach the sea during the next\r\nebb tide. In this case it will flow back up the channel with the next\r\nflood tide, and so be kept moving up and down, getting nearer, however,\r\nto the sea at each tide.\r\n\r\nDe Franchimont has shown (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. clx.) how a\r\ndiagrammatic route-guide can be prepared for any tidal river to show\r\npilots or captains of vessels the best times for starting on voyages up\r\nor down the river, and for passing each point on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Works in Tidal Rivers.=--If any works are required in the tidal\r\nportion of a river, the principles to be followed in designing them\r\nare the same as if the river was non-tidal. All that has been said\r\nin CHAP. VIII., _Arts. 1_ to _3_, applies to them. The river may be\r\nstraightened or trained or dredged. Generally training and dredging\r\nare combined. Any dredging in the portion of the river nearest the sea\r\nwill not, of course, alter the water levels near the mouth, but it will\r\nalter them further up. The tide will come up in greater volume and will\r\nrise higher and extend further up. The ebb will be facilitated, and the\r\nlow-water level will be lowered. If any narrowing of the channel near\r\nits mouth is effected by training walls for the purpose of lowering\r\nthe bed, the effect on the volume of tidal water entering the river\r\nmust be taken into consideration. If the narrowing is confined to a\r\nreach near the mouth, and if the resulting deepening is not sufficient\r\nto counteract the effect of the narrowing, the volume of tidal water\r\nreaching the unnarrowed portions of the channel will be reduced, and\r\nthis may be injurious. Its scouring action may be insufficient. The\r\nproper course may be to continue the narrowing upstream. If this is\r\ndone, then it is obvious that the width of channel in which deep water\r\nis to be maintained at high water, or which is to be kept free from\r\ndeposit, is reduced in about the same proportion as the volume of tidal\r\nwater is reduced, and no harm is likely to result.\r\n\r\nAny weir or similar structure which abruptly stops the flow of the tide\r\nup a river checks it of course for a long distance back, perhaps to the\r\nmouth. Old London Bridge used to obstruct the tide, and its removal\r\nincreased the range of the tide, and was beneficial.\r\n\r\nTidal rivers generally widen out to some extent near their mouths, and\r\nare thus rather estuaries than rivers. The works in such rivers are\r\nmore fully discussed in _Art. 5_.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Tidal Estuaries.=--If, instead of a river of uniform width, there\r\nis an estuary whose width increases steadily towards the sea so that it\r\nis funnel-shaped, the conditions described in _Art. 2_ are modified. An\r\nestuary is formed first by the waves of the sea, which wear away the\r\nangles at the mouth of the river and allow the tide to enter in greater\r\nvolume, and then by the flow and ebb of the tides. The slope of the\r\nbed of the estuary is usually much flatter than that of the river, and\r\nthe water surface is as shown in fig. 67. The tidal movements extend\r\nfurther upstream than in the case of a river, not only because of\r\nthe greater difficulty experienced by the upland water in filling up\r\nthe wide channel of the estuary, but because of the momentum of the\r\ntidal water driving its way up the funnel-shaped channel (_Art. 1_).\r\nThe capacity of the estuary is of course much greater than is required\r\nfor the discharge of the upland water alone. If the sea-level remained\r\nalways at one height and if the upland water contained silt, it would\r\ntend to deposit in the estuary and would certainly deposit in it to\r\nsome extent. The action of the sea water is the same as described in\r\n_Art. 2_, scouring if it is clear when entering, of less account if\r\nit is not clear. Owing to the funnel shape of the estuary, the tide\r\nrises higher at its upper end than if the estuary were replaced by a\r\nriver channel, and the tide also extends further up. This may partly\r\nor wholly compensate for the greater tendency of silt to deposit in an\r\nestuary as compared with a river channel.\r\n\r\nThe ebb tide in an estuary does not always follow exactly the same\r\ncourse as the flood tide. Of course the lowest parts of the estuary are\r\nfilled first and emptied last, but the channels are not all continuous.\r\nA channel open at its lower end may have a dead end at its upper\r\ntermination, and _vice versa_. Also, at sharp bends in the channels,\r\nthe momentum of the water may cause differences in the paths traversed\r\nby the flowing and ebbing currents. Wherever there is a deep channel\r\nthe water from the adjacent sandbanks tends, towards the close of the\r\nebb, to flow cross-wise into the channel, and in doing this it to some\r\nextent washes down the banks into the channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Works in Tidal Estuaries.=--Estuaries, when shallow, offer great\r\nfacilities for training. It used at one time to be said that any\r\nchange which reduces the volume of tidal flow must be injurious. It\r\nwould be injurious to restrict the mouth of the estuary, unless it\r\nwere exceptionally wide, and leave the rest untouched. If the whole\r\nestuary is narrowed, and a suitable funnel shape preserved, the width\r\nto be kept open is, relatively to the size of the mouth, no greater\r\nthan before, and the tide may flow up as far as before, and rise to as\r\nhigh a level. The narrowing, if properly arranged, will improve the\r\nshape of the estuary and cause an increased scour. The effect of the\r\nupland water is also greater in the narrower channel. Improvements to\r\nestuaries are not, however, restricted to training. There is always\r\none or more deep channels, and the best of these can be selected and\r\nimproved by dredging. The channel should be one along which both the\r\nflood tide and the ebb tide will run. The above remarks as to training\r\ndo not apply to a case in which there is a bar outside the mouth of the\r\nestuary. Training might check the scour at the bar. Bars are treated of\r\nin CHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nIf an estuary is not funnel-shaped, if, for instance, it widens out\r\nvery rapidly, the tidal flow is much less effective in keeping the\r\nchannel open. In this case, training works, which would give the\r\nnecessary funnel shape, are indicated rather than dredging. If an\r\nestuary is narrow at the entrance, the flow is much less powerful,\r\nunless the narrow part is of greater depth, but even then the force of\r\nthe tide is reduced owing to the change in the shape of the channel.\r\n\r\nThe bed of an estuary may be of such soft or sandy material that a\r\ndredged channel would be likely to be quickly filled up again by the\r\nslipping in of material at the sides (_Art. 4_). In such a case an\r\nuntrained channel can only be kept open to its full depth by constant\r\ndredging, and probably the best course is to construct a trained\r\nchannel, although it may be more expensive than in the case of a\r\nharder channel, because of the depth to which the foundations of the\r\nwalls must be sunk into the soft bed. Also, if the bed of the estuary\r\nis constantly shifting, a dredged channel alone will not succeed,\r\nand training must be resorted to. Again, the bed may be of such hard\r\nmaterial that training walls would not cause it to scour. In this case\r\na channel should be dredged and need not be trained. For the great body\r\nof intermediate cases in which the deep channel can be formed either by\r\ndredging or training, both methods can be adopted. A common plan is to\r\ntrain the upper part and to dredge the lower part where the estuary is\r\nwider and the training walls would be more exposed to the waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.]\r\n\r\nWhen an estuary is thus partly trained, the deepening due to the\r\ntraining does not extend far beyond the point where the walls\r\nterminate. The deposit of material along the sides of the estuary\r\nmay, however, extend some distance further down in places where the\r\ntide can no longer have free play. This occurred in the Seine estuary\r\n(fig. 68). The authorities of Havre, which lies at one side of the\r\nestuary not far from its mouth, feared that if the training walls were\r\nbrought further down, the deposits might extend to their neighbourhood.\r\nThe reduction in the capacity of the estuary, due to the deposits,\r\ncaused it to become filled up more quickly, and the time of high water\r\nat Havre was advanced. The dotted lines show a good arrangement of\r\ntraining walls proposed by Harcourt.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that it is always feasible to carry training walls\r\nright through an estuary, or at least down to a point where deep water\r\nis reached, and if a proper funnel shape is given to the channel the\r\nreduction of the tidal flow and silting up of the spaces behind the\r\nwalls need not cause any trouble. Training the complete estuary was\r\ncarried out in the case of the Tees, where, however, the estuary was\r\nnot of great length, and was not of a good shape for keeping itself\r\nopen. Any affluents entering the estuary can be provided with separate\r\ntrained channels. Difficulty may, however, arise if there are towns\r\nwhich would be shut off from the estuary by the silt banks.\r\n\r\nGenerally the line selected for the trained or dredged channel should,\r\nthough it must be as short and direct as possible, coincide as nearly\r\nas possible with that which the water naturally tends to keep open.\r\nThis may be toward one side of the estuary or the other, according to\r\nthe direction from which the tidal wave approaches. In the case of\r\nthe Dee, the best line was not adopted, attention having been chiefly\r\ngiven to the question of silting up the spaces outside the walls and so\r\nreclaiming land, a matter which should always be treated as of quite\r\nsecondary importance. Training walls in estuaries are generally built\r\nonly up to half-tide level. Were it not for the expense they might be\r\nbuilt up to high-water level. In the Seine estuary the walls were made\r\nof blocks of chalk.\r\n\r\nWhether a trained channel will keep itself open or will need periodical\r\ndredging depends, of course, on the amount of silt in the water and on\r\nits velocity and depth. The question must be worked out and calculated\r\nas in the case of a non-tidal river.\r\n\r\nThe estuary of the Mersey differs from most others. Towards the mouth,\r\nnear Liverpool, it is narrow and it widens out further inland. The\r\ntides, running through the narrow portion, to fill up the large inland\r\nbasin and to empty it again, keep the narrow part scoured to a great\r\ndepth. It was proposed to train the wide portion for the Manchester\r\nShip Canal. The training would, no doubt, have succeeded, but, owing to\r\nthe silting up of the greater part of the estuary, the scouring near\r\nLiverpool would have been very greatly reduced and serious damage done\r\nto that port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nRIVER BARS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Deltaic Rivers.=--When a river flows into a tideless sea its silt\r\ndeposits and forms a shoal or bar. This shoal may in time extend and\r\nrise up to the water-level. The current of the river makes its way\r\nthrough it in various directions, and in this way a delta is formed\r\nand constantly extends seawards. This flattens the slope of the lower\r\nportions of the river, and causes raising of the bed in the reaches\r\nupstream, and this again may cause the water to break out further\r\nupstream and form fresh channels to the sea. The bars at the mouths\r\nof deltaic rivers are generally formed with great rapidity, and they\r\nare apt to form a complete hindrance to navigation. They are sometimes\r\npartly scoured away by floods in the river, but in this case the\r\nscoured material may deposit on the outer slopes of the bar. If a river\r\nwhich carries silt has no delta, it is probably because there is a\r\nlittoral current, which prevents the silt from depositing. On the other\r\nhand, if a river brings down very heavy sediment, a delta may be formed\r\neven when tidal flow is not wholly absent. This occurs in the case of\r\nthe Ganges.\r\n\r\nThe bars at the mouths of deltaic rivers cannot usually be kept down\r\nby dredging except at great expense. The usual method of dealing with\r\nthem is to run out two parallel jetties, in continuation of the river\r\nbanks, so as to bring the mouth of the river out to the bar. The river\r\nthen scours a channel through the bar and, if the walls are not too\r\nfar apart, the depth will probably become as great as in the river and\r\nsufficient for navigation. The river, however, tends to at once form a\r\nnew bar further out. The rapidity with which the new bar forms will be\r\ngreater or less as the specific gravity of the materials carried by the\r\nriver is greater or less, and as the strength of any littoral current\r\nis less or greater. Clay is spread far out while sand quickly sinks.\r\nAll deposits are, however, swept away if there is a strong littoral\r\ncurrent. The steeper the slope of the bed of the sea away from the\r\nbar the longer the new deposit will take in forming a fresh bar. Also\r\nthe less the discharge of the river the less the deposit will be. The\r\nbranch of a deltaic river selected for improvement by having the bar at\r\nits mouth removed, should be one which has a small discharge and whose\r\nmouth is in a position where there is a strong littoral current. In the\r\ncase of the Rhone, the branch selected was the eastern one, whose mouth\r\nwas not exposed to any littoral current. Moreover, the other branches\r\nof the river were closed, and this increased the discharge of the\r\nbranch which was left open. The work did not succeed. In other cases,\r\nthe parallel jetty method has succeeded, and notably in the case of the\r\nMississippi. In this case willow mattresses weighted with stones were\r\nused. The question of keeping down the discharge does not, however,\r\nappear to have always received sufficient attention. In the case of the\r\nMississippi the “South pass” was selected for improvement. In order to\r\nremove a shoal its upper end was narrowed and its discharge reduced.\r\nThe upper ends of the other “passes” were then obstructed so as to\r\nrestore the discharges of all the passes to their former amounts. The\r\nwisdom of this step is questionable. It is desirable to keep down the\r\ndischarge of the branch which is to be improved to the lowest limit\r\nconsistent with free navigation.\r\n\r\nIf the width of the river near its mouth is greater than is desirable\r\nfor the width between the jetties, the latter are sometimes made to\r\nconverge though their outer ends are made parallel.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Mississippi the jetties were made with a slight\r\ncurve to the right. It would seem desirable always to make the jetties\r\nwith quite a considerable curve. The jetty which was convex to the\r\nchannel could then probably be shortened. In a case where there is a\r\nlittoral current, say to the right, the curve of the jetties could be\r\nto the right, so that the stream on issuing would tend to merge into\r\nthe current and assist it.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Other Rivers.=--It often happens that the materials--sand, gravel,\r\nand shingle--of which a sea beach is composed shift gradually along\r\nthe shore. This is known as “littoral drift.” It is by some supposed\r\nto be due to the action of the tides, and by others to the action of\r\nwaves, the drift taking place in the direction of the prevailing winds,\r\nexcluding those which are off shore. The latter cause is the more\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nMost rivers have bars at their mouths. In the case of deltaic rivers\r\nthe bar, as already stated, is caused by the heavy silt carried by the\r\nriver, though it may be assisted by littoral drift. In the case of\r\nnon-deltaic rivers flowing into tideless seas, the quantity of silt is\r\nnot enough to form a bar, and the same is generally true in the case of\r\ntidal rivers where the volume of tidal water is usually much greater\r\nthan that of the upland water. In both these classes of rivers the\r\nformation of the bars is due chiefly to littoral drift or to sediment\r\nbrought in by the sea water. The bar, as in the case of deltaic rivers,\r\nmay be partly scoured away by a flood in the river, and the scoured\r\nmaterial may deposit on the seaward slope of the bar. Generally, the\r\nnavigation channel across a bar of this kind can be kept sufficiently\r\ndeep by dredging, but sometimes jetties, like those mentioned in the\r\npreceding article, have been constructed, and in this case there is\r\nthe great advantage that the bar is not liable to form further out. If\r\nlittoral drift tends to accumulate, the jetties, or at least the one\r\non the side whence the drift comes, can be lengthened. This was done,\r\nas mentioned by Harcourt (_Rivers and Canals_, CHAP. IX.), in the case\r\nof the rivers Chicago, Buffalo, and Oswego, which flow into the Great\r\nLakes of America. The same writer states that the jetties at the Swine\r\nmouth of the tideless river Oder were made to curve to the left, the\r\nconvex or left-hand jetty being the shorter, but that this exposed the\r\nmouth to littoral drift coming from the left. The river, upstream of\r\nthe jetties, had a slight curve towards the left, but this could have\r\nbeen corrected or, at all events, the jetties made to curve to the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nA case (fig. 69) where parallel jetties were recently constructed in a\r\ntidal sea is that of the mouth of the Richmond River, New South Wales\r\n(_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._, vol. clx.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of a bar at the mouth of an estuary, parallel jetties would\r\nbe too far apart. In such cases converging breakwaters (fig. 70)\r\nare sometimes made, especially if the tidal capacity of the estuary\r\nis small. The entrance is generally 1000 to 2500 feet wide. If made\r\nnarrow, it would reduce the tidal flow too much. The space inside the\r\nbreakwaters adds to the tidal capacity, and thus induces scour at the\r\nbar. The case is similar to that of the Mersey estuary (CHAP. XIV.,\r\n_Art. 5_), the breakwaters assisting scour at the bar, though perhaps\r\nslightly interfering with the tidal flow in the estuary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.]\r\n\r\nConverging breakwaters also tend to stop littoral drift, and the space\r\ninside them acts as a harbour of refuge in storms and as a sheltered\r\nplace where dredgers can work (_Rivers and Canals_, CHAP. XI.). They\r\nhave to be heavily built and are very expensive, and they are generally\r\nadopted only when there is an important seaport, and when they can be\r\nput to all the uses above indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fallacies in the Hydraulics of Streams= (CHAP. I., _Art. 4_, and CHAP.\r\nVI., _Art 2_).--In an inundation canal in India the supply during\r\nfloods was excessive. Orders were given that a flume be made at the\r\nhead, as shown in fig. 71. The sides were to be revetted, as shown\r\nin fig. 19 (CHAP. VI., _Art. 3_); the length, excluding the splayed\r\nparts, was to be 200 feet, and the floor was to be a mattress well\r\nstaked or pegged down. The order stated that “by this means we cannot\r\nget into the canal much more than its true capacity.” With 9 feet of\r\nwater, a surface fall of 4 inches in 300 feet would give a velocity\r\nof some 6·5 feet per second, and a further fall of about 8 inches\r\nwould be required at the head of the flume to impress this velocity on\r\nthe water. The flume would reduce the depth of water in the canal by\r\n1 foot, _i.e._ from 9 feet to 8 feet. This would not be in anything\r\nlike the proportion desired. Moreover the flume, unless the bed was\r\nextremely well protected, would be destroyed. The above is a case of\r\nexaggerating the effect of an “obstruction.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.]\r\n\r\nAgain, on a branch canal it was observed that “wherever cattle\r\ncrossings exist there is a deep silt deposit which practically blocks\r\nthe branch.” The deposit exists because the sides of the channel are\r\nworn down. A wide place always tends to shoal (CHAP. IV., _Art. 9_). If\r\nthe deposit obstructed the flow of water there would be a rush of water\r\npast it, and it could not exist.\r\n\r\nThe Gagera branch of the Lower Chenab Canal--the left-hand branch in\r\nfig. 72--was found to silt. It was proposed to make a divide wall (fig.\r\n72) extending up to full supply level. The idea is unintelligible. The\r\nsilt does not travel by itself but is carried or rolled by the water.\r\nAs long as water entered the Gagera branch, silt would go with it. The\r\nauthorities, who had apparently accepted the proposal, altered the\r\nestimate when they received it, and ordered the wall to be made as\r\nshown dotted and of only half the height. This was done. The idea seems\r\nto have been that the wall would act as a sill and stop rolling silt.\r\nThis is intelligible, but see CHAP. IV., _Art. 2_, last paragraph.\r\nMoreover, there was a large gap, A B, in the wall. The work is said to\r\nhave proved useless, and proposals have been made to continue the wall\r\nfrom A to B. In this form it is conceivable that it may be of use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.]\r\n\r\nIn a river, the rises and falls at different places are not, of\r\ncoarse, the same, even when they are long continued. In the river\r\nChenab, at the railway bridge at Shershah, the rise from low water to\r\nhigh flood is generally a foot or two more than the rise at a point 25\r\nmiles upstream. It has been suggested that the railway embankments,\r\nwhich run across the flooded area, cause a heading up of the stream. If\r\nthis were the case, to any appreciable extent, there would be a “rapid”\r\nthrough the bridge, which, if it did not destroy the bridge, would at\r\nleast be visible and audible.\r\n\r\nThe exaggerated ideas which often prevail regarding the tendency of a\r\nriver, when in flood, to scour out a new channel, have been mentioned\r\nin CHAP. IV., _Art. 8_. Spring, in his paper on river control, admits,\r\nwhen mentioning Dera Ghazi Khan, that there was little danger, but in\r\nmentioning the Chenab Bridge at Shershah he quotes, without disputing\r\nit, an opinion of the opposite kind (_Government of India Technical\r\nPaper_, No. 153, “River Training and Control on the Guide Bank System”).\r\n\r\nFor some other fallacies, see _Hydraulics_, CHAP. VII., _Arts. 9_ and\r\n_15_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pitching and Bed Protection= (CHAP. VI., _Art. 3_, and CHAP. X.,\r\n_Art. 2_).--Any scour upstream of a weir is merely due to the eddies\r\nformed upstream of the crest (_Hydraulics_, CHAP. II., _Art. 7_), and\r\nis not serious. And, similarly, as to scour upstream of a pier. A hole\r\nformed alongside a pier or obstruction, if there is no floor, may work\r\nupstream. The chief use of a floor extending far upstream is to flatten\r\nthe hydraulic gradient (CHAP. X., _Art. 3_).\r\n\r\nFor pitching of the sides, monolithic concrete is not very suitable,\r\nbecause it may settle unequally and crack. For heavy pitching, concrete\r\nblocks can be used. They can rest on a layer of 3 to 6 inches of\r\nrammed ballast or gravel. The toe wall, as shown in fig. 13, page 65,\r\nis sometimes dispensed with, the pitching being merely continued to a\r\nsuitable depth below the bed, and the bottom edge being at right angles\r\nto the slope instead of horizontal. The portion below the bed may be of\r\nconcrete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abrupt changes in streams, 28.\r\n\r\n  Alterations in a channel, upstream effect, 4.\r\n\r\n  Aqueduct, Kali
