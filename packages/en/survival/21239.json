So they are stuck.\r\n\r\nThey try various ingenious ideas for getting out, each of which appears\r\nas though it would work, but in the end does not, usually in a quite\r\nentertaining way.  Eventually they do think of a way, which I will not\r\ndivulge here, and they get out, but it had been a long nerve-racking\r\nperiod before their final release.\r\n\r\nThe copy of the book I worked from looked at first sight as though it\r\nhad been beautifully printed.  But this turned out to be a delusion, for\r\nthe type-setting had been truly awful.  It does seem sad that an author,\r\na well-known one at the time, could take the trouble to write a good\r\nbook, that he should use a good publisher, and a good illustrator, a\r\ngood book-binder, only to have the whole thing let down by very poor\r\ntype-setting.  And that goes on down to proof-reading, too, for the\r\npublisher should have checked all this as well.  NH\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTHE CLIFF CLIMBERS\r\nA SEQUEL TO \"THE PLANT HUNTERS\"\r\n\r\nBY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE HIMALAYAS.\r\n\r\nWho has not heard of the Himalayas--those Titanic masses of mountains\r\nthat interpose themselves between the hot plains of India and the cold\r\ntable-lands of Thibet--a worthy barrier between the two greatest empires\r\nin the world, the Mogul and the Celestial?  The veriest tyro in\r\ngeography can tell you that they are the tallest mountains on the\r\nsurface of the earth; that their summits--a half-dozen of them at\r\nleast--surmount the sea-level by more than five miles of perpendicular\r\nheight; that more than thirty of them rise above twenty thousand feet,\r\nand carry upon their tops the eternal snow!\r\n\r\nThe more skilled geographer, or _geognosist_, could communicate hundreds\r\nof other interesting facts in relation to these majestic mountains; vast\r\nvolumes might be filled with most attractive details of them--their\r\n_fauna_, their _sylva_, and their _flora_.  But here, my reader, we have\r\nonly space to speak of a few of the more salient points, that may enable\r\nyou to form some idea of the Titanic grandeur of these mighty masses of\r\nsnow-crowned rock, which, towering aloft, frown or smile, as the case\r\nmay be, on our grand empire of Ind.\r\n\r\nIt is the language of writers to call the Himalayas a \"chain of\r\nmountains.\"  Spanish geographers would call them a \"sierra\" (saw)--a\r\nphrase which they have applied to the Andes of America.  Either term is\r\ninappropriate, when speaking of the Himalayas: for the vast tract\r\noccupied by these mountains--over 200,000 square miles, or three times\r\nthe size of Great Britain--in shape bears no resemblance to a chain.\r\nIts length is only six or seven times greater than its breadth--the\r\nformer being about a thousand miles, while the latter in many places\r\nextends through two degrees of the earth's latitude.\r\n\r\nMoreover, from the western termination of the Himalayas, in the country\r\nof Cabul, to their eastern declension near the banks of the\r\nBurrampooter, there is no continuity that would entitle them to the\r\nappellation of a \"chain of mountains.\"  Between these two points they\r\nare cut transversely--and in many places--by stupendous valleys, that\r\nform the channels of great rivers, which, instead of running east and\r\nwest, as the mountains themselves were supposed to trend, have their\r\ncourses in the transverse direction--often flowing due north or south.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, to a traveller approaching the Himalayas from any part\r\nof the great plain of India, these mountains present the appearance of a\r\nsingle range, stretching continuously along the horizon from east to\r\nwest.  This, however, is a mere optical illusion; and, instead of one\r\nrange, the Himalayas may be regarded as a _congeries_ of mountain\r\nridges, covering a superficies of 200,000 square miles, and running in\r\nas many different directions as there are points in the compass.\r\n\r\nWithin the circumference of this vast mountain tract there is great\r\nvariety of climate, soil, and productions.  Among the lower hills--those\r\ncontiguous to the plains of India--as well as in some of the more\r\nprofound valleys of the interior--the flora is of a tropical or\r\nsubtropical character.  The palm, the tree fern, and bamboo here\r\nflourish in free luxuriance.  Higher up appears the vegetation of the\r\ntemperate zone, represented by forests of gigantic oaks of various\r\nspecies, by sycamores, pines, walnut, and chestnut trees.  Still higher\r\nare the rhododendrons, the birches, and heaths; succeeded by a region of\r\nherbaceous vegetation--by slopes, and even table-plains, covered with\r\nrich grasses.  Stretching onward and upward to the line of the eternal\r\nsnow, there are encountered the _Cryptogamia_--the lichens and mosses of\r\nAlpine growth--just as they are found within the limits of the polar\r\ncircle; so that the traveller, who passes from the plains of India\r\ntowards the high ridges of the Himalayas, or who climbs out of one of\r\nthe deeper valleys up to some snow-clad summit that surmounts it, may\r\nexperience within a journey of a few hours' duration every degree of\r\nclimate, and observe a representative of every species of vegetation\r\nknown upon the face of the earth!\r\n\r\nThe Himalayas are not uninhabited.  On the contrary, one considerable\r\nkingdom (Nepaul), with many petty states and communities (as Bhotan,\r\nSikhim, Gurwhal, Kumaon, and the famed Cashmere), are found within their\r\nboundaries--some enjoying a sort of political independence, but most of\r\nthem living under the protection either of the Anglo-Indian empire, on\r\nthe one side, or that of China upon the other.  The inhabitants of these\r\nseveral states are of mixed races, and very different from the people of\r\nHindostan.  Towards the east--in Bhotan and Sikhim--they are chiefly of\r\nthe Mongolian stock, in customs and manners resembling the people of\r\nThibet, and, like them, practising the religion of the Lamas.  In the\r\nwestern Himalayas there is an admixture of Ghoorka mountaineers, Hindoos\r\nfrom the south, Sikhs from Lahore, and Mahometans from the old empire of\r\nthe Moguls; and here, also, are to be found, in full profession, the\r\nthree great representative religions of Asia--Mahometan, Buddhist, and\r\nBrahmin.\r\n\r\nThe population, however, is exceedingly small compared with the surface\r\nover which it is distributed; and there are many tracts in the Himalayan\r\nhills, thousands of square miles in extent, where no human being\r\ndwells--where no chimney sends up its smoke.  Indeed, there are vast\r\ntracts, especially among the high snow-covered summits, that have either\r\nnever been explored, or only very rarely, by the adventurous hunter.\r\nOthers there are quite inaccessible; and it is needless to say, that the\r\nhighest peaks--such as Chumulari, Kinchinjunga, Donkia, Dawalghisi, and\r\nthe like--are far beyond the reach of even the most daring climber.\r\nPerhaps no one has ever ascended to the height of five miles above the\r\nlevel of the sea; and it is a question whether at that elevation a human\r\nbeing could exist.  At such a height it is probable that animal life\r\nwould become extinct, by reason either of the extreme cold or the rarity\r\nof the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThough the Himalaya mountains have been known from the earliest historic\r\ntimes--for they are the _Imaus_ and _Emodus_ of the ancient writers--it\r\nis only within the present century that we in Europe have obtained any\r\ndefinite knowledge of them.  The Portuguese and Dutch--the first\r\nEuropean colonists of India--have told us very little about them; and\r\neven our own Anglo-Indian writers were long silent upon this interesting\r\ntheme.  Exaggerated accounts of the hostility and cruelty of the\r\nHimalayan highlanders--more especially the Ghoorkas--prevented private\r\nexplorations; and with the exception of some half-dozen books, most of\r\nthem referring to the western section of the Himalayas, and\r\ncomparatively valueless, from the want of scientific knowledge on the\r\npart of their authors, this vast tract has remained almost a _terra\r\nincognita_ up to the present time.\r\n\r\nOf late, however, we have obtained a better acquaintance with this\r\ninteresting portion of the earth's surface.  The botanist, lured thither\r\nby its magnificent _flora_, has opened to us a new world of vegetation.\r\nRoyle and Hooker have ably achieved this task.  The zoologist, equally\r\nattracted by its varied _fauna_, has made us acquainted with new forms\r\nof animal life.  Hodgson and Wallich are the historians in this\r\ndepartment.  Scarcely less are we indebted to the sportsman and hunter--\r\nto Markham, Dunlop, and Wilson the \"mountaineer.\"\r\n\r\nBut in addition to these names, that have become famous through the\r\npublished reports of their explorations, there are others that still\r\nremain unrecorded.  The _plant-hunter_--the humble but useful\r\ncommissioner of the enterprising nurseryman--has found his way into the\r\nHimalayas; has penetrated their most remote gorges; has climbed their\r\nsteepest declivities; and wandered along the limit of their eternal\r\nsnow.  In search of new forms of leaf and flower, he has forded the\r\nturbid stream, braved the roaring torrent, dared the dangerous\r\navalanche, and crossed the dread crevasse of the glistening glacier; and\r\nthough no printed book may record his adventurous experience, not the\r\nless has he contributed to our knowledge of this great mountain world.\r\nHis lessons may be read on the parterre, in the flowers of the purple\r\nmagnolia, the deodar, the rhododendron.  They may be found in the\r\ngreenhouse, in the eccentric blossoms of the orchis, and curious form of\r\nthe screw-pine--in the garden, in many a valuable root and fruit,\r\ndestined ere long to become favourites of the dessert-table.  It is ours\r\nto chronicle the story of an humble expedition of this kind--the\r\nadventures of a young plant-hunter, the _employe_ of an enterprising\r\n\"seedsman\" well-known in the world's metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nA VIEW FROM CHUMULARI.\r\n\r\nOur scene lies in the very heart of the Himalayas--in that district of\r\nthem least explored by English travellers, though not the most distant\r\nfrom the Anglo-Indian capital, Calcutta.  Almost due north of this city,\r\nand in that portion of the Himalayan ranges embraced by the great bend\r\nof the Burrampooter, may be found the spot upon which our interest is to\r\nbe fixed.  Literally may it be termed a spot, when compared in\r\nsuperficies with the vast extent of wilderness that surrounds it--a\r\nwilderness of bleak, barren ridges, of glistening glaciers, of snow-clad\r\nsummits, soaring one above another, or piled incongruously together like\r\ncumuli in the sky.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this chaos of rock, ice, and snow, Chumulari raises his\r\nmajestic summit, crowned and robed in white, as becomes his sacred\r\ncharacter.  Around are other forms, his acolytes and attendants, less in\r\nstature, but mighty mountains nevertheless, and, like him, wearing the\r\nvestment of everlasting purity.\r\n\r\nCould you stand upon the top of Chumulari, you would have under your\r\neye, and thousands of feet below your feet, the scene of our narrative--\r\nthe arena in which its various incidents were enacted.  Not so unlike an\r\namphitheatre would that scene appear--only differing from one, in the\r\nsmall number of the _dramatis persona_, and the entire absence of\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of Chumulari, looking down among the foot hills of this\r\nmajestic mountain, you might behold a valley of a singular character--so\r\nsingular as at once to fix your attention.  You would note that it is of\r\na regular oval shape; and that instead of being bounded by sloping\r\ndeclivities, it is girt by an almost vertical cliff that appears to be\r\ncontinuous all around it.  This cliff of dark granitic rock you might\r\nguess with your eye to rise several hundred feet sheer from the bottom\r\nof the valley.  If it were in the season of summer, you might further\r\nobserve, that receding from its brow a dark-coloured declivity of the\r\nmountain rises still higher, terminating all around in peaks and\r\nridges--which, being above the snow-line are continually covered with\r\nthe pale white mantle that has fallen upon them from the heavens.\r\n\r\nThese details would be taken in at the first glance; and then your eye\r\nwould wander into the valley below, and rest there--fixed by the\r\nsingularity of the scene, and charmed by its soft loveliness--so\r\nstrongly contrasting with the rude surroundings on which you had been\r\nhitherto gazing.\r\n\r\nThe form of the valley would suggest the existence of the grand\r\nelliptical crater of some extinct volcano.  But instead of the black\r\nsulphuric _scoria_, that you might expect to see strewed over its base,\r\nyou behold a verdant landscape of smiling loveliness, park-like plains\r\ninterposed with groves and copses, here and there a mound of rock-work,\r\nas if piled artificially and for ornament.  Around the cliffs appears a\r\nbelt of forest of darker green; and occupying the centre a limpid lake,\r\non whose silver surface at a certain hour of the day you might see\r\nreflected part of the snow-crowned summit on which you are standing--the\r\ncone of Chumulari itself.\r\n\r\nWith a good glass you might distinguish quadrupeds of several _species_\r\nstraying over the verdant pastures; birds of many kinds upon the wing,\r\nand others disporting themselves upon the surface of the lake.\r\n\r\nYou would be tempted to look for a grand mansion.  You would send your\r\nglance in every direction, expecting to see chimneys and turrets\r\novertopping the trees; but in this you would be disappointed.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the valley, near to the base of its bounding cliff, you\r\nmight see a white vapour ascending from the surface of the earth.  It\r\nwould be an error to believe it smoke.  It is not that--only the _rime_\r\nrising over a hot-spring bubbling out from the rocks and forming the\r\nlittle rivulet, that, like a silver string, connects it with the lake.\r\n\r\nCharmed with the view of this lovely valley, you would desire to visit\r\nit.  You would descend the long slope of Chumulari, and straggling\r\nthrough the labyrinth of rugged foot hills that surround it, you would\r\nreach the brow of the bounding precipice; but there you must come to a\r\nhalt.  No path leads downward; and if you are still determined to set\r\nfoot on the shores of that smiling lake, you will have to make the\r\ndescent of the cliffs by means of a rope or rope-ladder several hundred\r\nfeet in length.\r\n\r\nWith comrades to help you, you may accomplish this; but once in the\r\nvalley, you can only get out of it by remounting your rope-ladder: for\r\nyou will find no other means of exit.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the valley you may perceive a gap in the cliffs; and fancy\r\nthat through this you may make your way out to the side of the mountain.\r\nThe gap may be easily reached, by going up a gentle acclivity; but\r\nhaving passed through it, you will discover that it only guides you into\r\na gorge, like the valley itself, bounded on both sides by precipitous\r\ncliff's.  This gorge is half filled by a glacier; on the surface of\r\nwhich you may pass for a certain distance downward.  At the end of that\r\ndescent you will find the glacier cut by a deep crevasse, a hundred feet\r\nin depth and a hundred in width.  Without bridging the crevasse, you can\r\ngo no further; and if you did succeed in bridging it, further down you\r\nwould find others deeper and wider, over which it would be impossible\r\nfor you to pass.\r\n\r\nReturn then, and examine the singular valley into which you have made\r\nyour way.  You will find there trees of many kinds, quadrupeds of many\r\nkinds, birds of many kinds, and insects of many kinds--you will find\r\nevery form of animal life, except that of the human being.  If you find\r\nnot man, however, you may discover traces of him.  Close to the\r\nhot-spring, and forming a sort of \"lean-to\" against the cliff, you may\r\nobserve a rude hut built with blocks of stone, and plastered with mud\r\nfrom the bed of the rivulet.  Enter it.  You will find it empty, cold,\r\nuntenanted by living thing.  No furniture.  Stone couches covered with\r\nsedge and grass, upon which men may have slept or lain; and two or three\r\nblocks of granite upon which they may have sat.  That is all.  Some\r\npieces of skin hanging around the walls, and the bones of animals\r\nstrewed over the ground outside, give a clue to the kind of food upon\r\nwhich the inhabitants of the hut may have subsisted.  Hunters they must\r\nhave been.  That will be your natural conjecture.\r\n\r\nBut how did they get into this valley, and how got they out of it?  Of\r\ncourse, like yourself, they descended into it, and then ascended out\r\nagain, by means of a rope-ladder.\r\n\r\nThat would be the explanation at which you would arrive; and it would be\r\na satisfactory one, but for a circumstance that just now comes under\r\nyour observation.\r\n\r\nScanning the _facade_ of the cliff, your eye is arrested by a singular\r\nappearance.  You perceive a serried line, or rather a series of serried\r\nlines, running from the base in a vertical direction.  On drawing nearer\r\nto these curious objects, you discover them to be ladders--the lowest\r\nset upon the earth, and reaching to a ledge, upon which the second is\r\nrested; this one extending to a second ledge, on which the third ladder\r\nfinds support; and so on throughout a whole series of six.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, it would appear to you as if the _ci-devant_ denizens of\r\nthe hut had made their exodus from the valley by means of these ladders;\r\nand such would be the natural conviction, but for a circumstance that\r\nforbids belief in this mode of exit: _the ladders do not continue to the\r\ntop of the cliff_!  A long space, which would require two or three more\r\nsuch ladders to span it, still intervenes between the top of the highest\r\nand the brow of the precipice; and this could not have been scaled\r\nwithout additional ladders.  Where are they?  It is scarcely probable\r\nthey had been drawn up; and had they fallen back into the valley, they\r\nwould still be there.  There are none upon the ground.\r\n\r\nBut these conjectures do not require to be continued.  A short\r\nexamination of the cliff suffices to convince you that the design of\r\nscaling it by ladders could not have succeeded.  The ledge against which\r\nrests the top of the highest must have been found too narrow to support\r\nanother; or rather, the rocks above and projecting over would render it\r\nimpossible to place a ladder upon this ledge.  It is evident that the\r\nscheme had been tried and abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe very character of the attempt proves that they who had made it must\r\nhave been placed in a desperate situation--imprisoned within that\r\ncliff-girt valley, with no means of escaping from it, except such as\r\nthey themselves might devise.\r\n\r\nMoreover, after a complete exploration of the place, you can find no\r\nevidence that they ever did escape from their strange prison; and your\r\nthoughts can only shape themselves into conjectures, as to who they were\r\nthat had wandered into this out-of-the-way corner of the world; how they\r\ngot into, and how out of it; and, finally, whether they ever succeeded\r\nin getting out at all.  Your conjectures will come to an end, when you\r\nhave read the history of the _Cliff-climbers_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANT-HUNTER AND HIS COMPANIONS.\r\n\r\nKarl Linden, a young German student, who had taken part in the\r\nrevolutionary struggles of 1848, had by the act of banishment sought an\r\nasylum in London.  Like most refugees, he was without means; but,\r\ninstead of giving himself up to idle habits, he had sought and obtained\r\nemployment in one of those magnificent \"nurseries\" which are to be met\r\nwith in the suburbs of the world's metropolis.  His botanical knowledge\r\nsoon attracted the attention of his employer, the proprietor of the\r\nnursery--one of those enterprising and spirited men who, instead of\r\ncontenting themselves with merely cultivating the trees and\r\nflowering-plants already introduced into our gardens and greenhouses,\r\nexpend large sums of money in sending emissaries to all parts of the\r\nearth, to discover and bring home other rare and beautiful kinds.\r\n\r\nThese emissaries--botanical collectors, or \"plant-hunters,\" as they may\r\nbe called--in the pursuit of their calling, have explored, and are still\r\nengaged in exploring, the wildest and most remote countries of the\r\nglobe--such as the deep, dark forests upon the Amazon, the Orinoco, and\r\nthe Oregon in America; the hot equatorial regions of Africa; the\r\ntropical jungles of India; the rich woods of the Oriental islands; and,\r\nin short, wherever there is a prospect of discovering and obtaining new\r\nfloral or sylvan beauties.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of the Sikhim Himalaya by the accomplished botanist,\r\nHooker--recorded in a book of travels not inferior to that of the great\r\nHumboldt--had drawn attention to the rich and varied _flora_ of these\r\nmountains; and in consequence of this, the enterprising \"seedsman\" who\r\nhad given Karl Linden temporary employment in his garden, promoted him\r\nto a higher and more agreeable field of labour, by sending him as a\r\n\"plant-hunter\" to the Thibetan Himalayas.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by his brother, Caspar, the young botanist proceeded to\r\nCalcutta; and, after a short residence there, he set out for the\r\nHimalayas--taking a direction almost due north from the city of the\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\nHe had provided himself with a guide, in the person of a celebrated\r\nHindoo hunter or \"shikaree,\" called Ossaroo; and this individual was the\r\nsole attendant and companion of the two brothers--with the exception of\r\na large dog, of the boar-hound species, which had been brought with them\r\nfrom Europe, and that answered to the name of Fritz.\r\n\r\nThe young botanist had come to India furnished with a letter of\r\nintroduction to the manager of the Botanical Garden of Calcutta--an\r\nestablishment of world-wide renown.  There he had been hospitably\r\nreceived on his arrival in the Oriental city; and during his sojourn he\r\nhad spent much of his time within its boundaries.  Moreover, the\r\nauthorities of the place, interested in his expedition, had given him\r\nall the information in their power as to the route he intended\r\npursuing--though that was not much: for the portion of the Himalayas he\r\nwas about to explore was at that time a _terra incognita_ to\r\nEnglishmen--even in the city of Calcutta!\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to detail the many adventures that befel our\r\nplant-hunter and his party, during the progress of their journey towards\r\nthe Himalayas, and after they had entered within the grand gorges of\r\nthese mountains.  Suffice it to say, that in pursuit of a beautiful\r\nlittle animal--a \"musk-deer\"--they had gone up a gully filled by one of\r\nthose grand glaciers so common in the higher Himalayas; that the pursuit\r\nhad led them far up the ravine, and afterwards conducted them into a\r\nsingular crater-like valley--the one already described; that once in\r\nthis valley, they could find no way out of it, but by the ravine through\r\nwhich they had entered; and that on returning to make their exit, they\r\ndiscovered to their great consternation that a crevasse in the glacier,\r\nover which they had passed, had opened during their absence, and to such\r\nan extent as to render their exit impossible!\r\n\r\nThey had endeavoured to span this crevasse; and had spent much time in\r\nmaking a bridge of pine-trees for the purpose.  They had succeeded at\r\nlength in getting across the chasm--but only to find others in the\r\nglacier below, which no ingenuity could enable them to get over.\r\n\r\nThey were compelled to abandon the idea, and return again to the valley;\r\nwhich, though lovely to the eye, had now become hateful to their\r\nthoughts: since they knew it to be their _prison_.\r\n\r\nDuring their residence in the place, many adventures befel them with\r\nwild animals of various kinds.  There chanced to be a small herd of\r\n\"yaks,\" or grunting oxen, in the valley; and these formed for a time the\r\nstaple article of their food.  Caspar, who, though younger than Karl,\r\nwas the more skilled hunter of the two, had a very narrow escape from\r\nthe old yak bull; though he succeeded at length in killing the dangerous\r\nanimal.  Ossaroo was very near being eaten up by a pack of wild dogs--\r\nevery one of which he afterwards succeeded in killing; and Ossaroo was\r\nalso in danger of being swallowed up by an enemy of a very different\r\nkind--that is by a _quicksand_, into which he had got his legs while\r\nengaged in taking fish out of a net!\r\n\r\nKarl was not without _his_ hair-breadth \"'scape\"--having been chased by\r\na bear along a ledge of the cliff, from which he was compelled to make a\r\nmost perilous descent.  The bear itself took refuge in a cave, where it\r\nwas afterwards pursued and killed, by all three acting in concert,\r\nmaterially assisted by the dog Fritz.  They had incurred great risk in\r\nthis chase of the bear: for although they had succeeded in destroying\r\nthe formidable animal they lost themselves in the great labyrinthine\r\ncavern, and were only able to find their way out by making a fire with\r\nthe stocks of their guns, and rendering the bear's-grease available for\r\ncandles--which fortunately enabled them to extricate themselves.\r\n\r\nDuring the pursuit of the bear, and their subsequent endeavours to find\r\ntheir way out, our adventurers had been struck by the enormous\r\ndimensions of the cavern in which the animal had taken refuge; and in\r\nthe hope that some of its great galleries might lead out through the\r\nmountain, and offer them a way of escape from the valley, they had made\r\ntorches, and explored it from end to end.  It was all to no purpose; and\r\nbecoming satisfied that there was no exit by way of the cavern, they had\r\nat length desisted from the search.\r\n\r\nFrom this point shall we continue, in more circumstantial detail, the\r\nhistory of their attempts to escape from their mountain prison; which\r\nthey were now convinced could only be done by _climbing the cliff_ that\r\nencircled it.\r\n\r\nThe Cliff Climbers--by Captain Mayne Reid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nHOME TO THE HUT.\r\n\r\nEmerging from the cave after their fruitless exploration, all three--\r\nKarl, Caspar, and Ossaroo--sat down upon the rocks in front of the\r\ncliff, and for some time remained silent.  The looks of all betokened a\r\ndeep and hopeless despair.  The same thought was passing in their minds.\r\nA painful thought it was--that they were completely cut off from all\r\ncommunication with the world, and might never again look on human faces,\r\nsave their own!\r\n\r\nCaspar was the first to give expression to this gloomy foreboding.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, brother!\" groaned he, addressing himself to Karl, who sat nearest\r\nto him, \"oh! it is an awful fate!  Here must we live, here must we die,\r\nfar away from home, far away from the world--alone--alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Karl, deeply moved by the distress of his brother, \"no,\r\nCaspar, not alone--God is with us.  Let Him be our world.\"\r\n\r\nHowever Caspar in his conscience might have acknowledged the justice of\r\nthe admonition, it failed to cheer him.  Indeed, he could not help\r\nperceiving, that Karl had uttered the speech half doubtingly, and with\r\nthe design of affording consolation.  Moreover, the effort which Karl\r\nwas making to look hopeful and cheerful was evidently constrained; and\r\nonly the more convinced his companions that neither hope nor joy was in\r\nhis breast.\r\n\r\nTo Karl's consolatory words his brother made no rejoinder.  Ossaroo,\r\nhowever, gave vent to his thoughts by an ambiguous shake of the head,\r\nand a brief speech characteristic of that belief in fatalism peculiar to\r\nhis race.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sahibs,\" said he, addressing himself to both, \"if the Great Sahib\r\nin the sky will we go out from here, we go--if He no will, we no go--\r\nnivvamore.\"\r\n\r\nOssaroo's speech, however compatible with a true faith, did not\r\ncontribute much towards cheering the spirits of the party; and for\r\nanother long interval all remained silent.\r\n\r\nCaspar and Ossaroo appeared completely prostrated by the new\r\ndisappointment.  Karl, on the other hand, seemed less disposed to view\r\nthings despairingly; and as he sate, was evidently engaged in active\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile his companions observed this; though neither made any\r\nattempt to rouse him from his reverie.  They guessed, that, whatever was\r\npassing in his mind would soon be communicated to them.\r\n\r\nThey were right in this conjecture: for in a few minutes Karl terminated\r\nthe silence by addressing them.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said he, speaking in a tone of encouragement, \"we are wrong in\r\nso soon yielding to despair.  Let us not give up, till we are beaten at\r\nall points.  I have told you what my object was, when I first mounted\r\nupon that ledge, and discovered the cave and its surly occupant, the\r\nbear.  I thought then, that, if we could find a series of ledges one\r\nabove another, and sufficiently near each other, we might plant ladders\r\nupon them, and so reach the top.  You see that there is such a\r\nsuccession of ledges--just before your faces there.  Unfortunately there\r\nis one of the spaces high up yonder--where the cliff is darkest--that\r\ncannot be less than sixty or seventy feet in width.  I have ascertained\r\nthat by comparing it with the height from the ground to the cave--which\r\nI had just finished measuring when I met the bear.  It would be\r\nimpossible for us to make a ladder that length--or even to hoist it up\r\nthere if made--so that all thought of scaling the cliff at this point\r\nmust be given up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" interposed Caspar, catching at Karl's idea, \"there may be\r\nsome other part of the precipice where the ledges are nearer to each\r\nother?  Did you examine it all around?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  I had got no further than this place, when I met Master Bruin;\r\nand, as you know, our adventures with him and our exploration of the\r\ncave have taken up our time ever since, and, indeed, driven the design\r\nof the ladders quite out of my head.  Now, however, we may return to it;\r\nand our next move will be to go all round, and see whether a better\r\nplace may not be discovered.  To-night it is too late.  It already\r\nbegins to darken; and we must have clear daylight for such a purpose.\r\nLet us home to our hut, and have some supper and then go to rest--having\r\nfirst prayed to Him for success.  We may rise in better spirits, and\r\ncontinue our examination in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nTo this proposal there was no objection on the part of either Caspar or\r\nOssaroo.  On the contrary, the mention of supper--both being very\r\nhungry--had caused them to start to their feet with remarkable alacrity;\r\nand Karl, taking the lead, they followed him, Fritz in turn following\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at their hut, supper was cooked and eaten, with that zest\r\nwhich hunger always gives, even to the coarsest viands; and, having\r\ncarried out the remaining part of the programme which Karl had\r\nsuggested--that is, the offering up a prayer for success on the morrow--\r\nthe trio sought their grass-covered couches with a feeling of renewed\r\nhopefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nA MIDNIGHT INTRUDER.\r\n\r\nThey had been asleep several hours, when all three were suddenly\r\nawakened by the barking of Fritz.  During night hours the faithful\r\ncreature stayed habitually within the hut--where he also had his bed of\r\ndry grass.  On hearing any unusual noise without, he would rush forth\r\nand prowl about for awhile; and, after satisfying himself that there was\r\nno enemy in the neighbourhood, would return quietly to his lair.\r\n\r\nFritz was far from being a noisy dog.  He had seen too much service, and\r\ngathered too much wisdom, to waste his breath in idle barking; and it\r\nwas only upon grand and important occasions that he condescended to give\r\ntongue.  Then, however, his bark--or bay, it should rather be termed--\r\nwas terrific.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion in question--which happened just about the hour of\r\nmidnight--the three sleepers were suddenly awakened by his expansive\r\n\"yowl,\" that filled the whole valley, and reverberating from the cliffs,\r\nappeared continuous.  The dog, after uttering this warning note, had\r\nrushed out of the hut--which had no door to it--and it was from some\r\nplace down near the lake that his barking appeared to proceed.\r\n\r\n\"What can it be?\" was the prompt and _very_ natural inquiry of the three\r\nindividuals, whom Fritz had so abruptly awakened from their slumbers.\r\n\r\n\"Something Fritz is frightened at,\" said Caspar, who knew the dog's\r\nnature better than either of the others.  \"He don't bark that way at any\r\nsort of game that he knows he can conquer.  It's some animal that's a\r\nmatch for him, I warrant.  If the old yak bull were still alive, I\r\nshould say it was he.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be tigers in this valley; I never thought of that,\" rejoined\r\nKarl.  \"Now that I do think of it,\" continued he, drawing upon the\r\nreminiscences of his zoological reading, \"it is quite probable.  People\r\nbelieve the tiger to be exclusively an inhabitant of tropical or\r\nsubtropical regions.  That is an error.  On this continent (the speaker\r\nwas in Asia) the royal Bengal tiger ranges at least as far north as the\r\nlatitude of London.  I know he is found on the Amoor as high as the\r\nfiftieth degree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy on us!\" broke in Caspar; \"it may be a tiger, and we have never\r\nthought of having a door to our hut!  If it should be one--\"\r\n\r\nHere the hypothetic speech of Caspar was abruptly brought to a\r\nconclusion, by a singular noise from without--which was heard mingling\r\nin chorus with the baying of Fritz.\r\n\r\nThe noise in question bore some resemblance to the sound of a trumpet,\r\nonly sharper and more treble in its character.  It was in effect more\r\nlike the squeak of a _penny trumpet_ than the real article; and yet,\r\nwithal, there was something terrifying in the sound.\r\n\r\nIt must have terrified Fritz: for the moment after it was heard, the dog\r\ncame rushing back into the hut, as if pursued by a legion of horned\r\nbulls; and, though he kept up his angry baying, he appeared altogether\r\ndisinclined to venture out again.\r\n\r\nJust then, the singular noise was heard outside the door--something\r\nbetween a shriek and a whistle--and this time with a far more terrifying\r\neffect: since, whatever produced it--bird, beast, or man--was evidently\r\nnear, and still approaching nearer.\r\n\r\nOf the three individuals within the hut, only one had ever before heard\r\na sound exactly similar to that.  Ossaroo was the one.  The old shikaree\r\nrecognised the noise the moment it reached his ears, and knew perfectly\r\nwell the sort of instrument that must have been producing it; but he was\r\nhindered for a time from proclaiming his knowledge, by surprise, as well\r\nas a strong feeling of terror at hearing such a sound in such a place.\r\n\r\n\"By de wheels ob Juggernaut car!\" he gasped out.  \"Can't be--can't be;\r\nno possible him be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?  What?\" demanded Karl and Caspar, in a breath.\r\n\r\n\"See, sahibs! it him--it him!\" hurriedly rejoined the Hindoo, in a sort\r\nof shrieking whisper.  \"We all perish--it him--it him--de god--de\r\nmighty--de terrible--\"\r\n\r\nThere was no light within the hovel, except a faint glimmer from the\r\nmoon shining brightly enough outside; but it did not require any light\r\nto tell that the shikaree was frightened pretty nearly out of his\r\nsenses.  His companions could discover by his voice that he had suddenly\r\nchanged position, and was retreating backward to that corner of the hut\r\nfurthest from the doorway.  At the same time his words reached them in\r\nwhispers, cautioning them to lie close and keep silent.\r\n\r\nBoth, without knowing what the danger was, of course obeyed injunctions\r\nthus emphatically delivered; and remained sitting up on their couches\r\nwithout uttering a word.  Ossaroo, after having delivered his cautioning\r\nspeeches, kept equally silent.\r\n\r\nOnce more the strange sound fell upon their ears--this time as if the\r\ninstrument that produced it had been thrust into the doorway of the\r\nhovel.  At the same instant the turf outside, hitherto glistening under\r\na bright moonlight, became darkened by the shadow of an enormous\r\ncreature--as if the queen of night had suddenly disappeared behind the\r\nblackest of clouds!  Still the light could be seen beyond, and the moon\r\nwas shining.  It was no cloud that had obscured her; but some vast body\r\nmoving over the earth, and which, having come up to the front of the\r\nhovel, was there halting.\r\n\r\nKarl and Caspar fancied they could see a gigantic living form, with huge\r\nthick limbs, standing outside; but, indeed, both were as much terrified\r\nby the apparition as Ossaroo himself, though perhaps for a different\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nFritz must have been as much frightened as any of the four; and fear had\r\nproduced upon him an effect exactly similar to that it had produced upon\r\nOssaroo.  It kept him silent.  Cowering in a corner, Fritz was now as\r\nquiet as if he had been born a voiceless _dingo_.\r\n\r\nThis speechless trance seemed to have its influence upon the\r\nawe-inspiring shadow outside the door: for, after giving utterance to\r\nanother specimen of shrill piping, it withdrew with as much silence as\r\nif it had been but the shadow it appeared!\r\n\r\nCaspar's curiosity had become too strong to be kept any longer under the\r\ncontrol of his fears.  As soon as the strange intruder was seen moving\r\naway from the hut, he stole forward to the entrance, and looked out.\r\nKarl was not slow in following him; and Ossaroo also ventured from his\r\nhiding-place.\r\n\r\nA dark mass--in form like a quadruped, but one of gigantic size--could\r\nbe seen going off in the direction of the lake.  It moved in majestic\r\nsilence; but it could have been no shadow, for on crossing the stream--\r\nnear the point where the latter debouched into the lake--the plashing of\r\nits feet could be heard as it waded through the water, and eddies could\r\nbe seen upon the calm surface.  A simple shadow would not have made such\r\na commotion as that?\r\n\r\n\"Sahibs!\" said Ossaroo, in a tone of mysterious gravity, \"he be one ob\r\ntwo ting.  He eider be de god Brahma, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or what?\" demanded Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"An ole rogue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nA TALK ABOUT ELEPHANTS.\r\n\r\n\"An old rogue?\" said Caspar, repeating the words of the shikaree.  \"What\r\ndo you mean by that, Ossy?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you Feringhee, sahib, call _rogue_ elephant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! an elephant!\" echoed Karl and Caspar--both considerably relieved at\r\nthis natural explanation of what had appeared so like a supernatural\r\napparition.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly the thing looked like one,\" continued Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"But how could an elephant enter this valley?\"\r\n\r\nOssaroo could not answer this question.  He was himself equally puzzled\r\nby the appearance of the huge quadruped; and still rather inclined to\r\nthe belief that it was some of his trinity of Brahminee gods, that had\r\nfor the nonce assumed the elephantine form.  For that reason he made no\r\nattempt to explain the presence of such an animal in the valley.\r\n\r\n\"It is possible for one to have come up here from the lower country,\"\r\nremarked Karl, reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"But how could he get into the valley?\" again inquired Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"In the same way as we got in ourselves,\" was Karl's reply; \"up the\r\nglacier and through the gorge.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the crevasse that hinders us from getting out?  You forget that,\r\nbrother?  An elephant could no more cross it than he could fly; surely\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely not,\" rejoined Karl.  \"I did not say that he could have crossed\r\nthe crevasse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you mean that he may have come up here before we did?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so.  If it be an elephant we have seen--and what else can it\r\nbe?\" pursued Karl, no longer yielding to a belief in the supernatural\r\ncharacter of their nocturnal visitant--\"it must of course have got into\r\nthe valley before us.  The wonder is our having seen no signs of such an\r\nanimal before.  You, Caspar, have been about more than any of us.  Did\r\nyou never, in your rambles, observe anything like an elephant's track?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.  It never occurred to me to look for such a thing.  Who would\r\nhave thought of a great elephant having climbed up here?  One would\r\nfancy such unwieldy creatures quite incapable of ascending a mountain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! there you would be in error: for, singular as it may appear, the\r\nelephant is a wonderful climber, and can make his way almost anywhere\r\nthat a man can go.  It is a fact, that in the island of Ceylon the wild\r\nelephants are often found upon the top of Adam's Peak--to scale which is\r\ntrying to the nerves of the stoutest travellers.  It would not be\r\nsurprising to find one here.  Rather, I may say, it _is_ not: for now I\r\nfeel certain what we have just seen is an elephant, since it can be\r\nnothing else.  He may have entered this valley before us--by straying up\r\nthe glacier as we did, and crossing the chasm by the rock bridge--which\r\nI know he could have done as well as we.  Or else,\" continued Karl, in\r\nhis endeavour to account for the presence of the huge creature, \"he may\r\nhave come here long ago, even before there was any crevasse.  What is\r\nthere improbable in his having been here many years--perhaps all his\r\nlife, and that may be a hundred years or more?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought,\" said Caspar, \"that elephants were only found on the plains,\r\nwhere the vegetation is tropical and luxuriant.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is another popular error,\" replied Karl.  \"So far from affecting\r\ntropical plains, the elephant prefers to dwell high up on the mountains;\r\nand whenever he has the opportunity, he climbs thither.  He likes a\r\nmoderately cool atmosphere--where he may be less persecuted by flies and\r\nother troublesome insects: since, notwithstanding his great strength and\r\nthe thickness of his hide, so small a creature as a fly can give him the\r\ngreatest annoyance.  Like the tiger, he is by no means exclusively a\r\ntropical animal; but can live, and thrive too, in a cool, elevated\r\nregion, or in a high latitude of the temperate zone.\"\r\n\r\nKarl again expressed surprise that none of them had before that time\r\nobserved any traces of this gigantic quadruped, that must have been\r\ntheir neighbour ever since the commencement of their involuntary\r\nresidence in the valley.  Of course this surprise was fully shared by\r\nCaspar.  Ossaroo participated in it, but only to a very slight degree.\r\nThe shikaree was still inclined towards indulging in his superstitious\r\nbelief that the creature they had seen was not of the earth, but some\r\napparition of Brahma or Vishnu.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to combat this absurd fancy, his companions continued\r\nto search for an explanation of the strange circumstance of their not\r\nhaving sooner encountered the elephant.\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" suggested Caspar, \"there is nothing so strange about it.\r\nThere are many large tracts of the valley we have not explored; for\r\ninstance, that wide stretch of black forest that lies at its upper end.\r\nNeither of us has ever been through there since the first two days, when\r\nwe followed the deer all round, and went afterwards to examine the\r\ncliff.  For myself, I never strayed that way while hunting--because I\r\nalways found the game in the open grounds near the lake.  Now the\r\nelephant may have his lair in that piece of forest, and only come out at\r\nnight.  As for tracks, no doubt there are plenty, but I never thought of\r\nlooking for them.  You know, brother, we have been too busy in making\r\nour tree-bridge, and afterwards exploring the cavern, to think of much\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\nKarl admitted the truth of these observations; for it was as Caspar had\r\nalleged.  During the whole time of their residence in the valley, the\r\nminds of all three, filled with anxiety about the future, had been\r\nkeenly bent upon devising some means of escape; and on this account they\r\nhad given very little attention to anything that did not in some way\r\ncontribute to that end.  Even Caspar, in his hunting excursions, had not\r\ngone over one-half of the valley; nor had these excursions been very\r\nnumerous.  In three or four days he had procured as much _meat_ as was\r\nnecessary.  This had been carefully cured by Ossaroo, and formed the\r\nstaple of their daily food.  Only upon rare occasions were the guns\r\nafterwards used to procure a little fresh provision--such as a brace of\r\nwild duets from the lake, or one of the smaller game animals which could\r\nbe found almost any morning within gunshot distance of the hut.  For\r\nthese reasons many parts of the valley had been left unvisited; and it\r\nwas deemed possible enough for even a great elephant to have been all\r\nthe time dwelling within its boundaries, unseen by any of the party.\r\nIndulging in these conjectures, all three remained awake for more than\r\nan hour; but as the subject of their speculations appeared to have gone\r\naltogether away, they gradually came to the conclusion that he was not\r\ngoing to return at least for that night--and their confidence being thus\r\nrestored, they once more betook themselves to sleep--resolved in future\r\nto keep a sharp lookout for the dangerous neighbour that had so\r\nunexpectedly presented himself to their view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nRE-STOCKING THE GUNS.\r\n\r\nNext morning all three were astir betimes, and out of the hut by the\r\nearliest light of day.  Karl and Caspar were anxious to obtain more\r\ndefinite information about the elephant, whose existence Ossaroo was\r\nstill inclined to doubt.  Indeed, with the exception of the three or\r\nfour shrieking whistles to which the animal had given utterance, so\r\nsilently and mysteriously had he come and departed, that they might\r\nalmost have fancied the whole thing a dream.\r\n\r\nBut such an immense creature could not move about, without leaving some\r\ntraces of his presence; and as he had crossed the stream, or rather a\r\nlittle embayment of the lake into which the stream emptied itself, no\r\ndoubt his tracks would be found on the sandy shore.\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as the day broke, all three started for the spot\r\nwhere the creature had been seen to cross.\r\n\r\nOn reaching it, they could no longer doubt that an elephant had paid\r\nthem a visit.  Huge footprints--nearly as big as the bottom of a bushel\r\nmeasure--were deeply indented in the soft sand; and looking across the\r\n\"straits\" (for so they were in the habit of calling the narrow mouth of\r\nthe bay), they could see other similar tracks on the opposite shore,\r\nwhere the animal had waded out.\r\n\r\nOssaroo was no longer doubtful as to the character of the creature that\r\nhad made those tracks.  He had hunted elephants in the jungles of\r\nBengal, and knew all the peculiarities of the grand quadruped.  Such\r\nfootmarks as were now under his eyes could not have been made by a mere\r\nvisionary animal, but only by a real elephant in the flesh.\r\n\r\n\"And one of the biggest kind,\" asserted the shikaree, now speaking in\r\nfull confidence, and declaring, at the same time, that he could tell its\r\nheight to an inch.\r\n\r\n\"How can you do that?\" asked Caspar, in some surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Me berra easy tell, young sahib,\" replied Ossaroo; \"only need takee\r\nsize ob de rogue's foot.  Dis way, sahibs.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, the shikaree drew forth from one of his pockets a piece of\r\nstring; and, choosing one of the tracks which had made the clearest\r\nimpression, he carefully applied the string around its outer edge.  In\r\nthis way the circumference of the elephant's foot was obtained.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sahibs,\" said Ossaroo, holding the string between his fingers--\r\nthat portion of it which had been applied around the footprint--\"_twice_\r\nthe length of dis reachee to the top of he shoulder; that how Ossaroo\r\nknow he biggee elephant.\"\r\n\r\nThe circumference of the foot thus measured being nearly six feet, it\r\nwould follow, from the rule laid down by the shikaree, that the elephant\r\nin question was nearly twelve feet high; and this Karl knew to be one of\r\nthe largest.  Nor did Karl question the correctness of the deduction:\r\nfor he had often heard, from hunters whose word was not to be doubted,\r\nthat the height of an elephant is exactly twice the circumference of his\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nOssaroo, having now yielded up his belief--that the elephant was one of\r\nhis gods in disguise--declared with full confidence that the animal was\r\na _rogue_.  Karl needed no explanation of what was meant by this.  He\r\nknew that the rogue elephant is an old male, who, for some reason or\r\nother--perhaps for bad behaviour--has had the cold shoulder given him by\r\nthe rest of the herd, and from whose association he has been driven\r\naway.  Thus _cut_ by his former acquaintances, he is compelled to lead a\r\nsolitary life--the consequence of which is, that he becomes exceedingly\r\nspiteful and morose in his disposition, and will not only attack any\r\nother animal that may chance to cross his path, but will even seek them\r\nout, as if for the mere purpose of indulging in a spirit of revenge!\r\nThere are many such in the jungles of India, as well as in Africa; and,\r\nsince man himself is not excepted from this universal hostility, a rogue\r\nelephant is regarded as an exceedingly dangerous creature in the\r\nneighbourhood where he takes up his abode.  There are many instances\r\nrecorded--and well authenticated too--where human beings have been\r\nsacrificed to the fury of these gigantic monsters: and cases are known\r\nwhere a rogue elephant has purposely placed himself in waiting by the\r\nside of a frequented path, with the object of destroying the unwary\r\ntraveller!  In the valley of the Dheira Doon an elephant of this class--\r\none, too, that had once been tamed, but had escaped from his servitude--\r\nis known to have taken the lives of nearly twenty unfortunate people\r\nbefore his destruction could be effected.\r\n\r\nWell knowing these proclivities on the part of the _rogue_, Ossaroo at\r\nonce counselled caution in the future movements of all--a counsel which\r\nKarl was too prudent to reject; and even the bold, rash Caspar did not\r\nthink it proper to dissent from.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved, therefore, before continuing their projected\r\nexploration of the cliffs, to set their weapons once more in proper\r\norder--against any chance of an encounter with the elephant.\r\n\r\nTheir guns had to be re-stocked, and a new handle put into the axe--as\r\nwell as a shaft into the boar-spear of Ossaroo--for all the woodwork of\r\nthese weapons had been broken up and burnt into ashes in the manufacture\r\nof the candles of bear's-grease that had lighted them out of the cave.\r\n\r\nThe search after the ledges must necessarily be postponed; until they\r\ncould go upon that errand properly armed and equipped, against any enemy\r\nthat might oppose their progress.\r\n\r\nHaving come to this wise determination, they returned to their hut;\r\nkindled a fire; cooked breakfast; and having despatched the meal, at\r\nonce set about selecting pieces of wood for the various purposes for\r\nwhich they were required.\r\n\r\nThey had no difficulty in procuring just what was wanted: for the valley\r\ncontained many valuable sorts of timber; and several kinds that had been\r\nalready cut for other purposes, now well seasoned and ready to hand,\r\nwere found lying about the hut.\r\n\r\nSetting about their work in earnest, and labouring diligently from\r\nmorning to night--and even into the night hours--they knew they would\r\nnot be long in accomplishing a task so trifling as the stocking of a\r\ngun, or putting the handle to a boar-spear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nINSPECTING THE CLIFFS.\r\n\r\nWorking diligently with their knives two days sufficed to make guns,\r\naxe, and spear as good as ever.  Ossaroo also made himself a new bow and\r\na full quiver of arrows.\r\n\r\nOn the third morning, after breakfasting, all three set out with the\r\ndetermination not to leave any portion of the cliff unexamined.\r\n\r\nThe part which lay between their hut and the cave, Karl had already\r\nscrutinised with great care; so they went direct to the point where he\r\nhad left off, and there commenced their new survey.\r\n\r\nIt is true they had already examined the cliffs all around; but this was\r\njust after they arrived in the valley, and the purpose of that\r\nexploration was very different from that of the present one.\r\n\r\nThen they were only looking for a place by which they might climb out;\r\nand the idea of making ladders had not occurred to them.\r\n\r\nNow that this scheme had suggested itself, they entered upon their\r\nsecond survey with the view of ascertaining whether it was practicable\r\nor possible.  Consequently, they went in search of facts of a different\r\nnature--viz., to see if there existed a series of ledges, one above\r\nanother, that could be spanned by an equal number of such ladders as\r\nthey might be able to construct.\r\n\r\nThat they could make ladders of a prodigious length--allowing sufficient\r\ntime for the execution of the work--all felt confident.  They knew that\r\nthe Thibet pine-trees--the same sort as they had used in making the\r\nbridge for the glacier crevasse--grew in great numbers not far from\r\ntheir hut; and by selecting some of the slenderest trunks of these, they\r\nwould have the sides of as many ladders as they might want, almost ready\r\nmade, and each forty or fifty feet in length.\r\n\r\nIf there should only be discovered a series of ledges, with not more\r\nthan forty feet space between each two, there would be a fair hope of\r\ntheir being able to escalade the cliff, and escape from a place which,\r\nalthough one of the pleasantest-looking spots in the world, had now\r\nbecome to them loathsome as the interior of a dungeon.\r\n\r\nSure enough, and to the great joy of all, such a set of shelves was soon\r\nafter presented to their eyes--having, at least in appearance, all the\r\nrequirements of which they were in search.  The spaces between no two of\r\nthem appeared to be greater than thirty feet, some were much nearer to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe part of the cliff where these terraces were found was not quite so\r\nlow, as that where Karl had made his measurement.  It did not appear,\r\nhowever, to be more than three hundred and fifty feet--a fearful height,\r\nit is true--but nothing when compared with other sections of the same\r\nprecipice.  To reach to its top, more than a dozen ladders would be\r\nrequired--each between twenty and thirty feet in length.  The labour of\r\nmaking these ladders, with such tools as they had, might be looked upon\r\nas something stupendous--sufficient, you might suppose, to deter them\r\nfrom the task.  But you must endeavour to realise the situation in which\r\nthey were placed--with no other hope of being delivered from their\r\nmountain prison--and with this idea in your mind, you will comprehend\r\nwhy they should have been willing to undertake even a far greater\r\nlabour.  Of course, they did not expect to complete it in a day, neither\r\nin a week, nor in a month: for they well knew that it would take several\r\nmonths to make the number of ladders that would be required.  And then\r\nthere would be the additional labour of getting each into its place: as\r\nall, after the first one, would have to be carried up the cliff to the\r\nledge for which it should be constructed.  Indeed, to raise ladders of\r\nthirty feet in the manner contemplated, would seem an impossibility--\r\nthat is, for such strength or mechanism as they could command.\r\n\r\nAnd so it might have proved, had they intended to make these ladders of\r\nthe ordinary weight.  But they foresaw this difficulty, and hoped to get\r\nover it by making them of the very lightest kind--something that would\r\njust carry the weight of a man.\r\n\r\nBecoming more than half satisfied that at this point the precipice might\r\nbe scaled in the manner contemplated, they remained upon the ground in\r\norder to give it a thorough examination.  That done, they intended to\r\nmake the complete circuit of the valley, and ascertain whether there\r\nmight not be some other place still easier of ascent.\r\n\r\nThe point where they had halted was behind the tract of heavily-timbered\r\nforest--of which Caspar had spoken, and which up to this time none of\r\nthem had entered.  Between the trees and the cliff they were now\r\ncontemplating, there was a narrow strip of ground destitute of timber;\r\nand covered with a shingle of loose stones which had fallen from the\r\nmountain above.  Several boulders of large dimensions rested upon the\r\nground, at short distances apart; and there was one of a pillar-shape\r\nthat stood some twenty-feet high, while it was only about five or six in\r\ndiameter.  It bore a sort of rude resemblance to an obelisk; and one\r\nmight easily have fancied that the hand of man had accomplished its\r\nerection.  For all that, it was a mere freak of Nature, and had probably\r\nbeen set up by ancient glacier ice.  Up one of its sides there was a\r\nseries of projections, by which an active man might climb to the top;\r\nand Ossaroo _did_ climb it, partly out of playfulness, and partly, as he\r\nsaid, to get a better view of the cliff.  The shikaree stayed only a few\r\nminutes on its top; and his curiosity having been satisfied, he had let\r\nhimself down again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nA RECONNOISSANCE INTERRUPTED.\r\n\r\nThough the three had set out that morning with a wholesome dread of the\r\nelephant, and a determination to go about their reconnoissance with\r\ncaution, their joy at the discovery of the ledges, and the eagerness\r\nwith which they were scanning them, had for the moment banished from\r\ntheir minds all thoughts of the great quadruped.  They were thinking\r\nonly of ledges and ladders, and talking loudly of how the latter might\r\nbest be made and placed upon the former.\r\n\r\nJust then, and just at the moment Ossaroo descended from the obelisk\r\nrock, Fritz, who had been prowling about among the trees, set up a\r\nfearful baying--such another as that to which he had given utterance on\r\nthe night when the elephant had paid its visit to the hut.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain intonation of terror in the dog's voice--as if\r\nwhatever called it forth was something that inspired him with fear.  The\r\napprehension that it was the elephant occurred to all three at once; and\r\nwith a simultaneous impulse they faced towards the spot whence the\r\nbaying of the dog appeared to proceed.  Simultaneously, too, they\r\nclutched more firmly their respective weapons--Karl his rifle, Caspar\r\nhis double-barrel, and Ossaroo his bow, with an arrow at the string.\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous to say, that there was a certain amount of\r\nconsternation visible in the countenances of all three; which was rather\r\nincreased than diminished by the sight of Fritz dashing suddenly out of\r\nthe underwood, and running towards them at full speed, with his tail\r\nconsiderably below the horizontal.  Fritz, moreover, was giving\r\nutterance to something that very closely resembled a howl.  The dog had\r\nevidently been attacked by some animal that had put him to flight; and\r\nhis masters knew that it must be a formidable creature that was causing\r\nthe variant Fritz to behave in such an ignominious manner.\r\n\r\nThey were not kept long in doubt as to the character of Fritz's\r\nconqueror and pursuer: for close behind his hips, almost touching them,\r\nappeared a long, cylindrical, or trumpet-shaped object, of a bluish-grey\r\ncolour, protruding between two yellowish crescents, like a pair of huge\r\nivory horns.  Behind those appeared a pair of large ears, like flaps of\r\nsole leather; and in the rear of these last appendages came the round,\r\nmassive form of an enormous elephant!\r\n\r\nCrashing through the underwood, the monstrous creature soon cleared his\r\nbody from the timber, and rushed straight across the open ground--\r\nwinding his terrible trumpet as he went.  He was following Fritz as\r\nstraight as he could go, and evidently enraged at the dog.\r\n\r\nThe latter, on escaping from the tangle of the thicket, made direct for\r\nthe spot occupied by his masters--thus directing the elephant upon them.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer a question of protecting Fritz from his formidable\r\npursuer; for the elephant, on seeing three adversaries more worthy of\r\nhis tusks, seemed to forget all about the puny four-footed creature who\r\nhad provoked him; and at once directed his attack upon the upright\r\nbipeds--as if resolved to punish them for the misbehaviour of their\r\nsubordinate.\r\n\r\nThe three, standing close together, saw at a glance that Fritz was no\r\nlonger the object of the elephant's animosity: for the massive monster\r\nwas now charging directly down upon them.\r\n\r\nThere was no time for concerted counsel--neither to take nor to give it.\r\nEach had to act upon his own instinct; and following this each acted.\r\nKarl sent the bullet from his rifle right between the tusks of the\r\nadvancing foe; while Caspar fired both barrels of his piece \"bang\" into\r\nthe forehead of the monster.  Ossaroo's arrow was seen sticking through\r\nthe elephant's trunk; and the moment after Ossaroo's heels were\r\npresented to the enemy.\r\n\r\nKarl and Caspar also ran: for it would have been sheer madness to have\r\nremained a moment longer in that perilous proximity.  Indeed, it is but\r\njustice to the shikaree to say, that Karl and Caspar ran first: for they\r\nhad been the first to deliver their fire; and as soon as they had done\r\nso, each scampered as he best could.  They ran together; and fortunately\r\nfor both a large tree was near, with low horizontal limbs, which\r\nfavoured a rapid ascent towards its top.\r\n\r\nThere was only a second of time between the commencement of their flight\r\nand that of Ossaroo; but short as it was, it decided the preference of\r\nthe pursuer, and Ossaroo became the sole object of pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe shikaree would fain have made for the tree, to which the others were\r\nretreating; but the proboscis of the elephant was already so far\r\nadvanced in that direction, that there was every probability it might\r\nget lapped upon him before he could climb beyond reach.  For a moment he\r\nwas in a dilemma, and his customary coolness seemed to have forsaken\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe elephant was advancing upon him, its little switch of a tail\r\noscillating rapidly in the air, and its trunk stretched horizontally\r\ntowards him, with Ossaroo's own arrow still sticking in it.  It seemed\r\nto know that it was he who had sent that skewer through its gristly\r\nsnout--perhaps giving it far more pain than the leaden missiles that had\r\nflattened against its thick skull; and for this reason it had chosen him\r\nas the first victim of its vengeance.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Ossaroo's position was one of extreme peril--so much so that\r\nKarl and Caspar--now perceiving themselves comparatively safe from the\r\npursuit--uttered a simultaneous cry: both believing that their faithful\r\nguide and follower was on the point of \"coming to grief.\"\r\n\r\nOssaroo seemed bewildered at the very imminence of the danger.  But it\r\nwas only for a moment--only while he hesitated as to whether he should\r\ntry to reach the tree.  On perceiving that he could not do this with a\r\nfair chance of safety, he turned and ran in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nWhither?  To the obelisk.  Yes, by good fortune, the pillar from which\r\nhe had just descended was only ten paces distant; and Ossaroo, in\r\nreturning towards it, measured the ground with less than five.  Flinging\r\naway his now useless weapons, he clutched hold of the prominent points\r\nof the rock, and \"swarmed\" up it like a squirrel.\r\n\r\nHe had good occasion to employ all his powers of agility.  A second--\r\nhalf a second more--and he would have been too late: for ere he had\r\nreached the summit of the pillar, the digit point of the elephant's\r\ntrunk was inserted under the skirt of his tunic; and had the garment\r\nbeen of tougher material; Ossaroo would have been jerked back to the\r\nground more rapidly than he had ascended.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the cotton fabric--frail from long wear and exposure--gave\r\nway with a loud \"screed;\" and although the shikaree was stripped of his\r\ncoat-tail, and suffered a rather ignominious exposure, still he had the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that to this circumstance he was indebted for\r\nthe safety of his skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nOSSAROO ON THE OBELISK.\r\n\r\nThe moment after, Ossaroo stood upon the summit of the obelisk.  But\r\neven there he was far from being confident of security: for the pursuer\r\nhad not abandoned the hope of being able to reach him.  On the contrary,\r\nthe infuriated animal, on finding itself baulked by the worthlessness of\r\nthe fabric composing the skirt of the shikaree, spitefully tossed the\r\npiece of cloth from its trunk; and, rearing itself on its hind-legs,\r\nthrew its body into an erect attitude, with its fore-feet resting high\r\nup against the rock.\r\n\r\nOne might have fancied that it was about to climb the obelisk; and this\r\nit would certainly have done had the thing been possible.  As it was,\r\nhowever, Ossaroo was not out of danger: for as the elephant stood on its\r\nhind-legs, with its prehensile proboscis extended to the full length,\r\nthe tip of the latter was not more than six inches from the soles of his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe shikaree stood upright like a statue on its pedestal--though unlike\r\nto a statue in his features, which were anything but unmoved.  On the\r\ncontrary, his countenance exhibited the utmost consternation.  And no\r\nwonder: for he could plainly perceive that should the elephant succeed\r\nin lengthening its carcase only another twelve inches, he himself would\r\nbe brushed from the summit like a fly.\r\n\r\nIn fearful suspense, therefore, did he stand, contemplating the monster\r\nwhich was making every effort to reach him.\r\n\r\nThese efforts were made with as much sagacity as energy.  Not only did\r\nthe quadruped erect itself to its greatest height--standing, as one\r\nmight say, upon its toes--but on finding that it was not tall enough, it\r\nfell back upon all fours, and then reared up afresh in an endeavour to\r\nstretch still higher.\r\n\r\nSeveral times did it repeat the attempt--on each occasion trying a\r\ndifferent side of the rock--as if in hopes that a greater elevation of\r\nthe ground around the base might give it that advantage of twelve inches\r\nwhich it required for seizing its victim.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Ossaroo, the elephant had reached its very highest on\r\nfirst rearing up; and though it kept going round and round the rock,\r\nfrom no side could it do more than just touch with the top of its trunk\r\nthe edge of the little flat space, upon which the feet of the shikaree\r\nwere resting.\r\n\r\nOssaroo was beginning to be satisfied with this fact; and probably might\r\nhave come to believe himself secure in his position, but for a\r\ncircumstance that was making him uneasy.  It was, that, standing upon\r\nsuch a limited surface--a pedestal whose diameter was but little over\r\nthe length of his own feet--he found it exceedingly difficult to keep\r\nhis balance.  Had he been on the ground, there would have been no\r\ndifficulty about it; but, perched as he was full twenty-feet aloft, the\r\nthing was quite different; and, with nerves unstrung by the fearful\r\ndanger that threatened him below, it was just as much as he could do to\r\nkeep his equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThough only a \"mild Hindoo,\" Ossaroo was possessed of a high degree of\r\ncourage; and, most of his life having been spent as a shikaree, he had\r\nbecome well inured to the risk of losing it.  Had he been a coward, or\r\nunused to such perils as at that moment surrounded him, he would in all\r\nlikelihood have succumbed through fear; and toppled helplessly over upon\r\nthe shoulders of the merciless monster that was threatening to destroy\r\nhim.  With all his bravery, however, it was just as much as he could do\r\nto keep his balance.  Unfortunately, in climbing up the rock, he had\r\nbeen compelled to abandon his boar-spear: else with that he might have\r\nsupported himself.  His long knife was still in his belt; and this he\r\ndrew forth--not with the design of using it upon his antagonist, but\r\nonly the better to balance himself.  It is true he would have been fain\r\nto take a chop or two at the gristly proboscis of the elephant; but he\r\ndared not bend his body into a stooping attitude, lest his centre of\r\ngravity might get beyond the supporting base, and thus bring about the\r\nresult he dreaded.\r\n\r\nNo other course remained for him, than to preserve his body in an\r\nupright attitude; and, conscious of this fact, he braced his nerves to\r\nthe utmost, and maintained himself erect and rigid as a statue of\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nA WHOLESALE TUMBLE.\r\n\r\nIn this attitude he remained for several minutes--the elephant all the\r\nwhile continuing its efforts to reach him Karl and Caspar, seated upon\r\nthe branches of the tree, to which they had retreated, were witnesses of\r\nthe whole scene from beginning to end.  The situation of Ossaroo would\r\nhave bean sufficiently ludicrous for Caspar to have laughed at it, but\r\nfor the danger in which the shikaree was placed.  This was so evident,\r\nthat instead of indulging in anything akin to levity, Caspar looked on\r\nwith feelings of deep anxiety, Karl being equally apprehensive about the\r\nresult.  Neither could do anything to aid or rescue him, as they were\r\nunarmed--both having dropped their pieces when ascending the tree.\r\n\r\nI have said that Karl was as uneasy about the result as his brother.  He\r\nwas even more so.  It was not that he liked Ossaroo better, or would\r\nhave more bitterly lamented his fate, had the latter perished by the\r\nproboscis of the elephant.  No, that was not the reason; but simply that\r\nKarl more clearly comprehended the danger in which the shikaree was\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nAfter watching the efforts of the elephant for a short time, Caspar had\r\nbecome convinced that the animal could not reach Ossaroo--so long as the\r\nlatter preserved his balance upon the summit of the rock.  Karl was\r\nequally satisfied of this; and both by their shouts kept encouraging the\r\nshikaree to stand firm.  But Karl soon noted another circumstance, which\r\nwas as yet unperceived by Caspar, and it was this that was inspiring him\r\nwith keener apprehension than that felt by his brother.  He had noticed\r\nthat, each time as the elephant erected himself against the obelisk, the\r\nrock seemed slightly to shake.  Ossaroo was himself well aware of the\r\ncircumstance--and more troubled at it than any of them--for it rendered\r\nit more difficult for him to preserve his equilibrium.  Caspar at length\r\nalso observed the trembling of the rock, but it gave him no particular\r\nuneasiness: as, after what had passed, he felt confident that Ossaroo\r\nwould be able to keep his place.  Nor was it the fear of his falling in\r\nthat way that was distressing the young botanist; but rather a deduction\r\nwhich he drew from the circumstance, not apparent to the less\r\nphilosophic mind of his brother.\r\n\r\nThe shaking of the rock had suggested to Karl a dangerous contingency.\r\nWhat was it?  The speech addressed by him at that moment to Caspar will\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, brother!\" he exclaimed, on perceiving the danger, \"if the rock\r\nshould fall--\"\r\n\r\n\"No danger of that,\" said Caspar, interrupting him; \"it stands firm\r\nenough.  True, I see it shake a little, but only a very little; and that\r\nonly when the brute springs up against it.  No danger, I should think!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I fear there is clanger,\" rejoined Karl, in a tone of undiminished\r\nanxiety.  \"Not,\" added he, \"so long as the elephant acts as he is doing;\r\nbut he may not continue thus.  These creatures are wonderfully\r\nsagacious; and if he only perceives that the pillar moves under his\r\nweight, a new idea may get into his brain, and then it will be all up\r\nwith Ossaroo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!  I begin to comprehend you,\" said Caspar, beginning to share the\r\nalarm of his brother.  \"There is danger in that.  What is to be done?\r\nIf we only had our guns up here, we might open fire on the brute.\r\nWhether we succeeded in killing him or not, we might at all events\r\ndivert his attention from Ossaroo, and perhaps hinder him from thinking\r\nof the plan you speak of.  We might go down and get our guns.  What is\r\nto hinder us?--the elephant is too busy to notice us.\"\r\n\r\n\"True--an excellent idea of yours, brother Caspar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, to put it in execution.  I shall slip down to the ground;\r\nyou follow to the lowest branch, and I can hand the guns up to you.\r\nKeep steady, and don't you fear, Ossy!\" added the young hunter in a\r\nlouder voice, addressing himself to the shikaree.  \"We'll fetch him away\r\nfrom you directly--we'll tickle him with an ounce or two of lead through\r\nthat thick hide of his.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Caspar commenced letting himself rapidly down from branch to\r\nbranch, Karl following more leisurely.\r\n\r\nCaspar had got upon the lowest limb of the tree, and Karl on that\r\nimmediately above it, when a loud crash, accompanied by a piercing\r\nshriek, arrested the progress of both, causing them suddenly to turn\r\ntheir faces towards the obelisk.  During the short time that their eyes\r\nhad been averted from it, a complete change had taken place in that\r\ncurious tableau.  Instead of a tall column of stone, standing\r\ntwenty-feet perpendicular, the same column was now seen lying along the\r\nearth in a nearly horizontal position, with a huge mass of broken boughs\r\nand branches of trees crushed under its top.  Near its base, now\r\nupturned and standing almost vertically, was the elephant, no longer on\r\nits hind feet, nor yet on all fours, but down upon its back, kicking its\r\nhuge hoofs in the air, and making the most stupendous efforts to recover\r\nits legs.  Ossaroo was nowhere to be seen!\r\n\r\nThe contingency dreaded by Karl had come to pass.  The elephant, finding\r\nit impossible to reach the shikaree with its trunk--and no doubt judging\r\nby the \"feel\" that the rock was not immobile--had at length dropped down\r\non all fours and, placing its broad shoulder against it, backed by the\r\nenormous weight of its bulky body, had sent the column crashing among\r\nthe tops of a chestnut tree growing near--the trunk of which, yielding\r\nto the weight, gave way with a crash, and trunk, limbs, and branches\r\nwere all borne downward to the earth!\r\n\r\nThe elephant itself, not calculating that it should find the task so\r\neasy of performance, had fallen at the same time--its cumbrous body\r\nlosing balance by the impetus which it had thrown into the effort.  In\r\nshort, of the four objects that formed the tableau--rock and tree,\r\nquadruped and man--not one was standing any longer in its place--for it\r\nis superfluous to say that Ossaroo had gone down with the obelisk.\r\n\r\nBut where was Ossaroo?  That was the question that occurred to both Karl\r\nand Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! brother!\" groaned Caspar, \"I fear he is killed!\"\r\n\r\nKarl made no reply; but for all that, Caspar's reflection, delivered in\r\na loud tone, was not left without rejoinder.  Directly after the phrase\r\nhad issued from his lips, an answer was heard proceeding from among the\r\nbranches of the fallen chestnut tree, in a voice and with words that\r\ncaused the hearts of the brothers to beat with joy.\r\n\r\n\"No, young sahibs,\" replied the unseen Ossaroo; \"me no killee, me no bit\r\ndamage.  If I only can get pass de old rogue, I safe and sound as ibber.\r\nHere go for run!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the shikaree was seen shooting out from among the\r\nbranches under which he had been for the time buried; and, then running\r\nwith all his might towards the tree upon which the brothers had found\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\nLong before the elephant could regain its feet, Ossaroo had reached a\r\nposition of perfect security among the upper branches of the great tree;\r\nwhich Karl and Caspar, no longer thinking of their guns, had also\r\nre-ascended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nA RING PERFORMANCE.\r\n\r\nAs the tree into which they had retreated was a very large one, there\r\nwas no longer any present fear of danger from the elephant, however\r\nfurious the latter might be; and they could look down upon it and watch\r\nits movements with a feeling of perfect security.  The only one of the\r\nparty that was in dangerous proximity to that dreaded proboscis was\r\nFritz; but Fritz had already been well warned of the wicked designs of\r\nthe great brute, and was sufficiently swift-footed and sage enough to\r\ngive the animal a wide berth.\r\n\r\nAs for the elephant itself, having recovered its feet, it stood for some\r\nseconds flapping its huge ears, and apparently in a kind of quandary--as\r\nif taken aback by the unexpected accident that had befallen it.  Not for\r\nlong, however, did it continue in this tranquil attitude.  The arrow\r\nstill sticking in its trunk reminded it of its purposes of vengeance.\r\nOnce more angrily elevating its tail, and sounding its shrill trumpet,\r\nit rushed towards the fallen tree, and buried its long proboscis among\r\nthe branches.  One by one it turned them over, as if in search of some\r\nobject.  It was searching for the shikaree.\r\n\r\nAfter a time it desisted from this manoeuvre, and looked around--\r\nevidently with a puzzled air, and wondering what had become of the man.\r\nIt had not seen him as he rushed towards the great tree: for his retreat\r\nhad been made while the creature was sprawling upon its back.  Just then\r\nFritz chanced to show himself--crouching under the branches upon which\r\nhis masters had taken refuge, and evidently envying them their secure\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe sight of Fritz was enough.  It was he who had first challenged the\r\nelephant on its approach through the woods, and had conducted it under\r\nthat terrible battery of bullets and arrows.  As soon, therefore, as the\r\nlatter set eyes upon the dog, its fury not only became rekindled, but\r\napparently redoubled; and, hoisting its tail on high, it charged full\r\ntilt upon its original adversary.\r\n\r\nHad the assailant been a boar, or even a bull, no doubt Fritz would have\r\nstood his ground, or only swerved to one side, the better to elude the\r\nonset, and make an attack in turn.  But with a quadruped as big as a\r\nhouse--and of which Fritz, not being of Oriental origin, knew so little;\r\nand of that little nothing that was good--one, too, evidently provided\r\nwith most formidable weapons, a tongue several feet long, and tusks in\r\nproportion--it is not to be wondered at, nor is it any great blot upon\r\nhis escutcheon, that Fritz turned tail and fled.  So fast fled he, that\r\nin less than a score of seconds he was out of sight--not only of his\r\nmasters in the tree, but of his pursuer, the elephant.  The latter only\r\nfollowed him for some half-dozen lengths of its own carcase; and seeing\r\nthat the pursuit was likely to be a wild-goose chase, declined following\r\nFritz any farther.\r\n\r\nThey in the tree, as the elephant started after the dog, were in hopes\r\nthat the pursuit might carry the dangerous animal to some distance, and\r\nthus give them time to get back to the ground, and make their escape\r\nfrom the spot.\r\n\r\nIn this, however, they were doomed to disappointment; for having\r\ndesisted from the chase of the dog, the great pachyderm returned to the\r\npoint from whence it had started; and, after once more tossing the\r\nbroken branches of the fallen chestnut tree upon the point of its\r\nproboscis, it commenced pacing round and round the fallen obelisk,\r\nkeeping in regular circles, as if it were training itself for some\r\nperformance in an amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour did the brute continue this circular promenade, at\r\nintervals stopping to give utterance to its shrieking note; but most of\r\nthe time moving on in sullen silence.  Now and then it directed its\r\neyes, and once or twice its trunk, towards the branches of the prostrate\r\ntree as if it had still some suspicion that he who sent that stinging\r\narrow was there concealed.  Indeed, it appeared by its movements to be\r\nkeeping guard over that particular spot, lest its enemy should escape.\r\nIt had long since extracted the arrow, by placing its great foot upon\r\nthe shaft, and drawing it forth.\r\n\r\nFritz had stolen back to the edge of the thicket, but kept cowering so\r\nclose that the elephant could not see him.\r\n\r\nThe parties perched above were more than annoyed by their imprisonment\r\nthus procrastinated, and began to think of how they might set themselves\r\nfree.  They talked of making a rush to possess themselves of their guns;\r\nbut to Karl this appeared too perilous to be attempted.  It was not\r\ntwenty yards from the tree to the spot where rested the dismounted\r\nmonolith; and the elephant, whose eye was in a state of continual\r\nactivity, could not fail to see them descending from the branches.  The\r\nmassive creature, though it moved about with apparently a gentle griding\r\nstep, could go almost as fast as a galloping horse; and should it espy\r\nthem in time, there would be but slight chance of eluding its prehensile\r\ntrunk.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the sight of them--even should they succeed in regaining the\r\ntree--would rekindle its rage, and cause it to prolong its stay upon the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another consideration that influenced them to remain\r\npatiently on their perch.  They knew that they had provided themselves\r\nwith only a very limited quantity of ammunition.  That article had\r\nbecome scarce with them; and they had prudently determined to economise\r\nit.  Karl had only two bullets left, with just powder enough to make two\r\ncharges; while Caspar's horn and pouch were not better filled.  They\r\nmight fire their whole stock of lead into the elephant, and still not\r\nsucceed in killing a creature that sometimes walks off triumphantly with\r\na score of bullets \"under his belt.\"  These shots might only have the\r\neffect of incensing it still more, and causing it to stay upon the\r\nground to an indefinite period.\r\n\r\nIt was a true _rogue_--Ossaroo had long since pronounced it one--and an\r\n\"old tusker\" at that.  It was therefore a most dangerous creature; and\r\nthough they knew they would never be safe in that valley until it should\r\nbe destroyed, it was agreed by all that it would be more prudent to\r\nleave it undisturbed until some more favourable opportunity occurred for\r\neffecting its destruction.\r\n\r\nFor these various reasons they resolved to remain quiet in the tree, and\r\npatiently await the termination of that curious \"ring performance,\"\r\nwhich the old tusker still continued to keep up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nAN ODD APPEARANCE.\r\n\r\nFor the full length of another hour did the trio in the tree have their\r\npatience tested.  During all that time the \"rogue\" remained upon the\r\nground, continuing his perambulations around the rock--until he had\r\ntrodden out a path that resembled the arena of a circus at the close of\r\na night's performance.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say that the time hung heavily upon the hands of\r\nthe spectators--to say nothing of Fritz, who would no doubt have been\r\nsatisfied with a much shorter programme.\r\n\r\nAs regards the former, the hour might have been spent less pleasantly\r\nthan it was; for it so chanced that an _interlude_ was introduced, of so\r\ninteresting a character to all, but more especially to the naturalist\r\nKarl, that for a while the proximity of their savage besieger was\r\nforgotten, and they scarcely remembered that they were besieged.\r\n\r\nFavoured by the accident of their situation, they became spectators of a\r\nscene--one of those scenes only to be viewed amid the wild solitudes of\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nNot far from the tree on which they had found shelter, stood another of\r\nequal dimensions, but of an entirely different species.  It was a\r\nsycamore, as even Caspar, without any botanical skill, could testify.\r\nIts smooth bark, piebald with white and green spots, its\r\nwidely-straggling limbs and leaves, left no doubt about its being one.\r\nIt was the sycamore, identical with its European congener, the _Platanus\r\norientalis_.\r\n\r\nIt is the habit of this fine tree to become hollow.  Not only does the\r\nlower part of its trunk exhibit the phenomenon of great cavities, but\r\nholes are found high up in its main shaft or in the larger limbs.\r\n\r\nThe tree in question stood within a few yards of that on which Karl,\r\nCaspar, and Ossaroo were perched.  It was just before their eyes,\r\nwhenever they looked in a horizontal direction; and occasionally, when\r\ntired with watching the monotonous movements of the elephant, one or\r\nother of them _did_ look horizontally.  The scanty foliage upon the\r\nsycamore enabled them to see its trunk and most of its larger limbs,\r\nwithout any obstruction of leaves or branches.\r\n\r\nCaspar had not cast his eyes more than twice in the direction of this\r\ntree, when he saw there was something peculiar about it.  Caspar was a\r\nyouth of quick sight and equally quick perception.  In the main stem of\r\nthe tree, and about six feet above its first forking, he perceived an\r\nobject that at once fixed his attention.  It looked like a goat's horn,\r\nonly that it was more like the curving tusk of a rhinoceros or a very\r\nyoung elephant.  It was sticking out from the tree, with the curve\r\ndirected downwards.  Altogether, it looked quite different from a branch\r\nof the sycamore, or anything belonging to the tree.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, while Caspar had his eyes upon it, he thought or fancied\r\nthat it moved; but not being sure of this, he said nothing, lest the\r\nothers might laugh at him.  It would not have been the first time that\r\nKarl, from his superior knowledge, had indulged in a laugh at his\r\nbrother's expense.\r\n\r\nCaspar's attention being now engrossed by the peculiar appearance he had\r\nnoted, he continued to scrutinise it; and soon perceived that around the\r\ncurved excrescence there was a circular disc some eight or ten inches in\r\ndiameter, and differing in colour from the bark of the sycamore--by\r\nbeing many shades darker.  This disc appeared composed of some substance\r\nthat was not ligneous: for it no more resembled wood than the curved\r\nivory-like object that protruded from its centre.  Had Caspar been asked\r\nwhat it did look like, he would have answered that it resembled the\r\nagglutinated mud used by swallows in building their nests--so like it,\r\nthat it might have been the same substance.\r\n\r\nCaspar continued to scrutinise these two curious objects--the tusk-like\r\nexcrescence, and the dark disc from which it protruded; and not until he\r\nbecame fully aware that the former had life in it, did he communicate\r\nhis discovery to his companions.  Of this fact he was convinced by\r\nseeing the crescent suddenly disappear--as if drawn within the tree,\r\nwhile in its place a dark round hole was alone visible.  Presently the\r\nyellowish horn reappeared through the hole, and protruded outside,\r\nfilling it up as before!\r\n\r\nCaspar was too much astonished by this exhibition to remain any longer\r\nthe sole proprietor of such a mysterious secret, and without more delay\r\nhe communicated his discovery to Karl, and indirectly to Ossaroo.\r\n\r\nBoth at the same time turned their eyes towards the tree, and bent them\r\nupon the indicated spot.  Karl was as much mystified by the strange\r\nappearance as had been Caspar himself.\r\n\r\nNot so Ossaroo.  The moment he saw the carving ivory and the\r\ndark-coloured disc, he pronounced, in a tone of careless indifference,\r\nthe simple phrase,--\r\n\r\n\"_Hornbill_--_de bird on him nest_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nA CURIOUS NEST.\r\n\r\nJust then the curved projection was observed to recede within the tree;\r\nand in its place appeared a small dark hole, apparently the entrance to\r\na larger cavity.  Karl, as Caspar had done the moment before, saw this\r\nwith surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Nest?\" repeated Caspar, astonished at the shikaree's statement.  \"A\r\nbird's nest?  Is that what you mean, Ossy?\"\r\n\r\n\"That just it, sahib.  Nest of great biggee bird.  Feringhees him call\r\n_horneebill_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" rejoined Caspar, not greatly enlightened by Ossaroo's\r\nexplanation, \"that's very curious.  We have seen something like a horn\r\nsticking out of the tree, though it looks more like ivory than horn.  It\r\nmay be the bill of a bird; but as to a bird itself, or the nest of one,\r\nwhere is that, pray?\"\r\n\r\nOssaroo intimated that the nest was inside the tree; and that the bird\r\nwas on the nest just behind its beak, where it ought to be.\r\n\r\n\"What! the bird is in that hole where we saw the white thing sticking\r\nout?  Why, it quite filled the hole, and if there's a bird there, and\r\nwhat we saw be its bill, I have only to say that its bill must be as big\r\nas its body--else how can it get out and in through so small an\r\naperture?  Certainly I see no hole but the one.  Oh! perhaps the bird is\r\na _toucan_.  I have heard there are some of that sort that can go\r\nthrough any place where they can pass their beaks.  Is it a toucan,\r\nOssaroo?\"\r\n\r\nOssaroo could not tell what a toucan was, never having heard of such a\r\nbird.  His ornithological knowledge went no further than to the birds of\r\nBengal; and the toucan is found only in America.  He stated that the\r\nbird in the tree was called by the Feringhees a \"hornbill,\" but it was\r\nalso known to some as the \"rhinoceros bird.\"  Ossaroo added that it was\r\nas large as a goose; and that its body was many times thicker than its\r\nbill, thick as the latter appeared to be.\r\n\r\n\"And you say it has its nest inside that hole?\" interrogated Caspar,\r\npointing to the little round aperture, which did not appear to be over\r\nthree inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"Sure of it, young sahib,\" was Ossaroo's reply.\r\n\r\n\"Well, certainly there is some living creature in there, since we have\r\nseen it move; and if it be a bird as large as a goose, will you explain\r\nto me how it got in, and how it means to get out?  There must be a\r\nlarger entrance on the other side of the tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sahib,\" confidently asserted Ossaroo; \"that you see before your\r\neye--that the only way to de horneebill nest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for you, Ossy!  So you mean to say that a bird as large as a\r\ngoose can go in and out by that hole?  Why, a sparrow could scarcely\r\nsqueeze itself through there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Horneebill he no goee in, he no goee out.  He stay inside till him\r\nlittle chickees ready for leavee nest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Ossy!\" said Caspar, in a bantering way; \"that story is too good\r\nto be true.  You don't expect us to believe all that?  What, stay in the\r\nnest till the young are ready to leave it!  And how then?  How will the\r\nyoung ones help their mother out of the scrape?  How will they get out\r\nthemselves: for I suppose they don't leave the nest till they are pretty\r\nwell grown?  Come! good shikaree; let us have no more circumlocution\r\nabout the matter, but explain all these apparently inexplicable\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\nThe shikaree, thus appealed to, proceeded to give the explanation\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nThe hornbill, he said, when about to bring forth its young, selects a\r\nhollow in some tree, just large enough conveniently to hold the nest\r\nwhich it builds, and also its own body.  As soon as the nest is\r\nconstructed and the eggs all laid, the female bird takes her seat upon\r\nthem, and there remains; not only until the eggs are hatched, but for a\r\nlong time afterwards--in fact, until the young are nearly fledged and\r\nable to take care of themselves.  In order that she may be protected\r\nduring the period of her incubation against weasels, polecats,\r\nichneumons, and all such vermin, a design exhibiting either wonderful\r\ninstinct or sagacity, is carried into execution by the male.  As soon as\r\nhis mate has squatted upon her eggs, he goes to work at the masonic art;\r\nand using his great horned mandibles, first as a hod, and afterwards as\r\na trowel, he walls up the entrance to the nest--leaving an aperture just\r\nlarge enough to be filled up by the beak of the female.  The material\r\nemployed by him for this purpose is a kind of agglutinated mud, which he\r\nprocures from the neighbouring watercourse or quagmire, and somewhat\r\nsimilar to that used by the common house-swallow for constructing _its_\r\npeculiar nest.  When dried, this mud becomes exceedingly hard--bidding\r\ndefiance to the teeth and claws of all would-be intruders, whether bird\r\nor quadruped; and with the horny beak of the old hen projected outward,\r\nand quite filling up the aperture, even the slippery tree-snake cannot\r\nfind room enough to squeeze his body through.  The female, thus free\r\nfrom all fear of being molested, quietly continues her incubation!\r\n\r\nWhen Ossaroo had got thus far with his explanation, Caspar interrupted\r\nhim with a query.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said he, \"sit all the time--for weeks, I suppose--without ever\r\ncoming out--without taking an airing?  And how does she get her food?\"\r\n\r\nAs Caspar put this question, and before Ossaroo had time to answer, a\r\nnoise reached their ears which appeared to proceed from the sky above\r\nthem.  It was a noise well calculated to inspire terror in those who had\r\nnever before heard it, or did not know what was causing it.  It was a\r\nsort of fluttering, clattering sound, or rather a series of sounds,\r\nresembling the quickly repeated gusts of a violent storm.\r\n\r\nThe moment Ossaroo heard it, he knew what it was; and instead of giving\r\na direct answer to Caspar's question, he simply said--\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit, sahib.  Here come old cockee horneebill; he show you how de\r\nhen getee her food.\"\r\n\r\nThe words had scarcely passed from the lips of the shikaree, when the\r\ncause of that singular noise became known to his companions.  The maker\r\nof it appeared before them in the form of a great bird, that with a\r\nstrong flapping of its wings flew past the tree in which they were\r\nseated, towards that which contained the nest.\r\n\r\nIn an instant afterwards, it was seen resting on a spur-like projection\r\nof the trunk, just below the aperture; and it needed not Ossaroo to tell\r\nthem that it was the cock hornbill that had there alighted.  The large\r\nbeak--the tip of it resembling that which they had already seen sticking\r\nout of the hole, and which was once more visible and in motion--\r\nsurmounted by an immense helmet-like protuberance, rising upon the\r\ncrown, and running several inches along the top of the upper mandible,\r\nwhich might have been taken for a second beak--this singular appendage\r\ncould belong to no other bird than the _hornbill_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE HORNBILL.\r\n\r\nKarl, although he had never seen one of these birds alive, had yet\r\nexamined stuffed specimens of them in museums, and he had no difficulty\r\nin recognising the bird.  He was able even to identify the species, for\r\nthere are many species of hornbill, known under the generic name,\r\n_Bucerus_.  That before their eyes was the _Bucerus rhinoceros_, or\r\n\"rhinoceros hornbill,\" called also the \"topau,\" and sometimes the\r\n\"horned Indian raven,\" from a sort of resemblance which it bears both in\r\nshape and habits to the well-known bird of this name.\r\n\r\nOssaroo had not exaggerated the size of these birds when he compared it\r\nto that of a goose.  On the contrary, he had rather moderated the\r\ndimensions: for the one in question looked much larger than either goose\r\nor gander.  It was rather more than three feet in length--reckoning from\r\nthe tip of its tail to the point of its curving beak, which of itself\r\nwas nearly a foot long!  Its colour was black above, and yellowish-white\r\nunderneath, the tail feathers being a clear white, with a broad black\r\nband crossing them near the middle.  Its bill, like that of its mate\r\nalready observed, was of a yellowish-white, the upper mandible being\r\nreddish around the base, while the casque-like protuberance exhibited a\r\nmottled surface of white and black.\r\n\r\nOssaroo had to tell them pretty nearly all he knew in relation to this\r\ncurious bird; for although there are several species of hornbills\r\nnatives of India, it is by no means a common creature, even at home in\r\nits own country.\r\n\r\nKarl could have told them much more about its species and habits, and no\r\ndoubt he would have done so had they been otherwise engaged.  But\r\nsituated as they were, with an angry elephant besieging them in the\r\ntree, and now for a while interested in observing the movements of the\r\nbird itself, Karl was in no humour to deliver an ornithological lecture.\r\nHe might have told them that ornithologists have differed much about\r\nthe classification of the hornbill--some of them placing it among the\r\ntoucans, while others assert that it belongs to the crow family.  Its\r\nimmense beak--out of all proportion to its body--is not the only point\r\nof resemblance it bears to the toucans.  Like them, it flings its food\r\ninto the air, catching and swallowing it as it comes down.  Unlike the\r\ntoucans, however, it cannot climb trees, and is therefore not of the\r\nScansorial order.  It is said to be omnivorous in its food; and in this\r\nit resembles the crows and ravens: but, indeed, as already stated, there\r\nare many species of hornbills, and the habits of the different kinds, by\r\nno means uniform or alike, have been confounded by most writers.  There\r\nare species in Africa, others in India and the Indian islands, and New\r\nGuinea is known to have one or two distinct species of its own.  All\r\nthese differ not only in size, colour, shape of their beak, and the\r\nprotuberance that surmounts it; but also in the kind of food which they\r\nlive upon.  For instance, the African hornbills, and one or more of the\r\nAsiatic species, are carnivorous, and some even carrion-eaters.  These\r\nare filthy birds, their flesh and feathers smelling rank as those of\r\nvultures.  On the other hand, there is a species in the Indian islands--\r\nthe Moluccas more particularly--whose sole food is the nutmeg, which\r\ngives to its flesh an exquisite aromatic flavour, causing it to be much\r\nrelished at the tables of Oriental epicures.  The bill of this species\r\nafter a certain time appears with a number of grooves or furrows in it.\r\nAs these furrows are observed only on the beaks of the old birds, the\r\nDutch colonists established in the Moluccas believe them to indicate\r\ntheir age, each wrinkle standing for a year.  Hence the hornbill has\r\nobtained among the colonists the name of _Yerrvogel_ (year bird).\r\n\r\nKarl, as I have said, was acquainted with all these facts in the natural\r\nhistory of the hornbill; but just then he did not think of making them\r\nknown to his companions--all three being too much occupied in watching\r\nthe movements of the male bird.  It was evident that he was not one of\r\nthe vegetable feeders: for on his alighting they could see hanging from\r\nhis beak a long cylindrical object, which they were able to identify as\r\na portion--the head and part of the body--of a dead snake.  It was\r\nequally evident that his mate was not accustomed to a vegetable diet:\r\nfor from the way in which he was manoeuvring, the spectators saw that\r\nthe mutilated reptile was intended for her.  No doubt it was her dinner,\r\nfor it had now got to that hour of the day.\r\n\r\nShe was not to be kept waiting any longer.  Almost on the instant her\r\nprovider alighted on the projecting spur, with a toss of his head he\r\njerked the piece of snake up into the air, and then caught it as it came\r\ndown again--not with the intention to swallow it, but only to get a\r\nbetter grip, in order that he might deliver it the more adroitly into\r\nthe mandibles of his mate--now protruding through the aperture, and\r\nopened to receive it.\r\n\r\nIn another instant the savoury morsel was transferred from the beak of\r\nthe male to that of the female; and then the ivory forceps of the\r\nlatter, with the snake held tightly between them, disappeared within the\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nThe old cock stayed not a moment longer upon the tree.  He had served\r\nhis mate with her dinner, and perhaps he had yet to bring on the\r\ndessert.  Whether or not, he rose immediately afterwards into the air,\r\nwith the same clangorous clapping of his wings; but this time the noise\r\nwas accompanied by the clattering of his horny mandibles, like a pair of\r\ncastanets, causing a sound not only singular, but, if heard by\r\nstrangers, calculated to beget within them a considerable feeling of\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nA FOUR-FOOTED BURGLAR.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the bird, that had taught our young adventurers\r\nso interesting a chapter of natural history, the elephant once more\r\nengrossed their attention.  Not that there was anything new in the\r\nmovements of the latter--for it was acting just as before--but simply\r\nbecause they knew that, so long as it remained upon the ground, they\r\nwould have to stay in the tree; and they naturally bent their eyes upon\r\nit, to see if it was showing any signs of moving off.  They could\r\nperceive none.  Not the slightest appearance to indicate its intention\r\nof departing from the spot.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in regarding the besieger, their eyes were of course\r\nremoved from the sycamore; nor might they have been again turned towards\r\nthat tree--at least, not for a good while--but for a sound that reached\r\ntheir ears, and which appeared to proceed from the direction of the\r\nhornbill's nest.  It was a soft and rather plaintive sound--unlike any\r\nthat had been made by the rhinoceros bird; nor was it at all like the\r\nvoice of a bird, of any kind.  It was more like the utterance of some\r\nfour-footed creature; or it might even have been a human voice\r\npronouncing the syllable \"wha,\" several times repeated.\r\n\r\nThat it was neither bird nor human being, Ossaroo could tell the moment\r\nhe heard the first \"wha.\"  Almost as soon were the others convinced that\r\nit was neither: for on turning their eyes to the sycamore, they saw upon\r\nthe projecting spur that had been so lately occupied by the hornbill, a\r\ncreature of a very different kind--in short, a quadruped.\r\n\r\nHad it been in an American forest, they might have taken the creature\r\nfor a racoon though a very large one.  On closer scrutiny, many points\r\nof resemblance, and also of difference, would have become apparent.\r\nLike the racoon, it had plantigrade feet, a burly, rounded body, and a\r\nvery thick hairy tail--ringed also like that of the American animal--but\r\nunlike the latter, its muzzle, instead of being long and slender, was\r\nshort, round, and somewhat cat-like; while its hair, or more properly\r\nits fur, formed a thick even coat all over its body, limbs, and tail,\r\nand presented a smooth and shining surface.  Its general colour was a\r\nvery dark brown, streaked and mottled with golden yellow; and Caspar\r\nremarked, upon the moment of seeing it, that it was one of the\r\nhandsomest creatures he had ever beheld.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist Cuvier had made the same remark long before Caspar's\r\ntime.  So said Karl, on hearing the observation escape from the lips of\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\nOssaroo knew that the animal was the \"wha,\" a name derived from its\r\nordinary call; and that it was sometimes known as the \"chetwa,\" and also\r\nthe \"panda.\"\r\n\r\nKarl, on hearing Ossaroo's name for it, and indeed, on hearing it\r\npronounced by the creature itself, was able to identify the animal, and\r\nto give it still another name--that which has been bestowed upon it by\r\nFrederick Cuvier--_ailurus_.  This is the generic name, of which, up to\r\nthe present time, it has been left in undisturbed possession.  Since\r\nonly one species has been discovered, it has the name all to itself; and\r\ntherefore would not require any specific appellation.  But for all that,\r\none has been given to it.  On account of its shining coat, it has been\r\ncalled the _ailurus fulgens_.\r\n\r\nThough the closet naturalists, in following out their pedantic\r\npropensities, have created a genus expressly for this animal, there is\r\nnothing either in its appearance or habits to separate it from the\r\nbadgers, the racoons, the coatimondis, and such other predatory\r\ncreatures.  Like them it preys upon birds and their eggs, as also on the\r\nsmaller kinds of quadrupeds, and like the racoon, it is a nimble\r\ntree-climber.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which the particular panda, of which we are writing,\r\nfirst appeared to the eyes of Karl and Caspar, proved this capacity, and\r\nits actions the moment after testified to its fondness for birds'-eggs.\r\nIt had not been a minute under the eyes of the spectators, when they saw\r\nthat it was after the eggs of the hornbill; perhaps, too, it might have\r\nhad a design of tasting the flesh of their owner.\r\n\r\nResting its thick plantigrade hind feet upon the projection of the tree,\r\nit erected itself like a little bear; and with its fore-paws commenced\r\nscraping at the barrier wall which the male bird had spent so much time\r\nand taken so much pains in building.  It is possible that if it had been\r\nleft to itself, it might in time have succeeded in forcing an entrance\r\ninto the nest, and highly probable too--or it would scarcely have\r\nentered upon the task.  But it was not left to itself.  Not that the\r\nsitter inside could have done much to hinder it: though it was evident\r\nfrom the way in which her beak was repeatedly projected and drawn back\r\nthrough the hole, and also from her angry hissing, that she knew there\r\nwas danger without, and that an enemy was assailing her citadel.\r\n\r\nMost likely after a time, and by constant scraping, the clay wall would\r\neventually have been pulled down; but before that event came to pass, a\r\nloud flapping and fluttering, and cracking and clattering, was heard\r\namong the tops of the trees; and in an instant afterwards the broad,\r\nshadowy wings of the old male hornbill were swashing about the ears of\r\nthe four-footed robber, where the long cutlass-like beak, armed at its\r\nedges, at once interrupted the intent.\r\n\r\nThe panda, taken by surprise, quailed at this first onset: for like any\r\nother _paterfamilias_ who on returning home finds a burglar breaking\r\ninto his house, the cock bird charged in the full tide of impetuous\r\nfury.\r\n\r\nThe robber, however, evidently used to this sort of thing, soon\r\nrecovered his self-possession; and instead of retreating from the tree,\r\nhe only planted himself more firmly upon the projection; and, facing\r\ntowards his feathery assailant, prepared to show fight.\r\n\r\nAnd fight was instantly shown on both sides--the bird swooping\r\nrepeatedly at its adversary, striking with its strong wings and\r\nthrusting with its ensiform beak; while the quadruped played back both\r\nwith teeth and claws--several times plucking a mouthful of feathers from\r\nthe breast of its winged adversary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nFRITZ INTERFERES.\r\n\r\nHow the affair might have ended had the panda and the hornbill been the\r\nonly parties to the combat, can but be guessed at.  In all likelihood\r\nthe quadruped would have triumphed over the biped: the entrance would\r\nhave been forced; the old hen dragged off her nest--perhaps killed and\r\neaten--and the eggs after her.\r\n\r\nBut it was not written in the book of destiny that this should be the\r\n_denouement_ of that little drama: for at that moment an incident\r\noccurred which changed the whole character of the contest--followed by a\r\nseries of other incidents which brought the affair to a termination\r\nunexpected by all parties engaged, as well as by those who witnessed it.\r\n\r\nThe first of these incidents--and that which formed the key to this\r\nchange in the circumstances of the combat, was one of a very ludicrous\r\ncharacter--so much so as to elicit laughter from the spectators in the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that the eyes of the panda, as the animal stood erect on its\r\nhind quarters, were directly opposite the little aperture that\r\nrepresented the entrance to the nest.  Not dreaming of any danger in\r\nthat direction, the robber only thought of guarding his \"daylights\"\r\nagainst the hornbill upon the wing.  But the hen bird inside the nest--\r\nwho could see well enough what was passing outside--had no idea of\r\nremaining a passive spectator; and perceiving her opportunity--for she\r\nwas within striking distance--she quietly drew back her long ivory beak,\r\nand, throwing all the strength of her neck into the effort--assisted by\r\nthe weight of her heavy helmeted head--as if with the blow of a\r\npick-axe, she struck the panda right in the eye--the sharp point\r\npenetrating almost to its skull.\r\n\r\nTerror-stricken, partly by surprise at this unexpected stroke, and\r\npartly by the pain caused by it, the quadruped uttered a shrill cry; and\r\nat once scrambling down from the tree, seemed only anxious to make his\r\nescape.  In this design he, no doubt, would have succeeded, with only\r\nthe loss of an eye; but the eye of still another enemy had been upon\r\nhim--one whom he had yet to encounter.  Fritz, from his position near\r\nthe bottom of the tree, attracted by the noise of the strife, had drawn\r\nnearer; and looking up, had been watching the combat throughout.  It is\r\nscarcely probable that the sympathies of honest Fritz could have been\r\notherwise than in favour of the innocent bird, and against the guilty\r\nbeast; but whatever way they may have been inclined, certain it is that\r\nas the panda came to \"grass,\" the dog \"jumped\" it upon the instant, and\r\ncommenced worrying it, as if the creature had been the oldest and\r\nbitterest of his enemies!\r\n\r\nDespite the suddenness of this new attack--equally unexpected as the\r\npeck in the eye--the fierce panda showed no signs of yielding without a\r\nstruggle; and, although far overmatched by its canine antagonist, it was\r\nlikely to give the latter a scratch or two, as souvenirs that he would\r\ncarry to his grave.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment a much greater danger was threatening Fritz than any\r\nharm he might suffer from the claws of the panda; and had chance not\r\nfavoured him, as he jumped about in the struggle, by turning his eyes in\r\na particular direction, he would have found himself in the clutches of\r\nan antagonist, that would have shown him as little mercy as he was\r\nhimself extending to the poor panda.\r\n\r\nBut he was favoured by chance: for it was nothing more that directed his\r\nglance towards his old pursuer, the elephant; and showed him the latter,\r\nat that moment advancing upon him at a charging pace, with eyes\r\nsparkling in silent vengeance, and trunk extended to seize him.  Under\r\nthe circumstances, it did not cost Fritz a moment's calculation as to\r\nwhat course he should pursue.  Suddenly dropping the panda--as if he had\r\ndiscovered the quadruped to be a lump of poison--he bounded from the\r\nspot in a direction the very opposite to that by which the elephant was\r\napproaching; and in less than a score of seconds the only part of him to\r\nbe seen was the tip of his tail just disappearing into the thicket.\r\n\r\nOf all the creatures that had borne part in this curious affray, the\r\npoor panda was perhaps the most to be pitied.  At all events he was the\r\nmost unfortunate: for with the drama ended also his life.  In every one\r\nencountered by him he had found an enemy; and in the last he met with a\r\ndread foe that soon made a finish of him.  This last was the elephant.\r\nThe great animal, rushing forward upon Fritz, seeing that the latter had\r\nescaped, was determined this time not to be baulked of a victim.\r\nInstead of carrying out the design it had only partially resolved upon--\r\nthat of following Fritz into the forest--it suddenly altered its plan,\r\nand transferred its hostility to the panda.  It saw that the latter was\r\nwithin reach: for half blinded by the beak of the bird, and half worried\r\nto death by the dog, the creature did not perceive, as Fritz had done,\r\nthe approach of the elephant.  It is possible it may have seen the\r\ndanger, but not until the elephant had got in such dangerous proximity\r\nas left it no chance of escape.\r\n\r\nBefore the panda could make the slightest effort to get away from the\r\nground, the elephant had lapped its prehensile proboscis around it, and\r\nlifted it into the air as if its body had been no heavier than a\r\nfeather.  Holding it aloft, the merciless monster took several long\r\nstrides in the direction of the fallen obelisk; and then, as if choosing\r\na spot suitable for its design, it placed the still struggling body of\r\nthe panda upon the ground, set its huge fore-feet upon it, and using\r\nthem alternately, continued to trample it until the only vestige left of\r\nthe crushed creature was a shapeless mass of fur and flesh!\r\n\r\nIt was a painful spectacle to those in the tree; but it was succeeded by\r\na sight that was pleasant to all three--the sight of the elephant's hind\r\nquarters as it walked off toward the woods, evidently with the intention\r\nof retiring from the ground.\r\n\r\nWhether its vengeance had been satisfied by the destruction of the\r\npanda, or whether it had gone off in search of Fritz, none of the three\r\ncould conjecture; but whatever may have been the motive, certain it is\r\nthat it guided the rogue from the spot, and raised a siege that was on\r\nthe point of becoming exceedingly irksome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\n\"DEATH TO THE ROGUE.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the elephant was fairly out of sight, the besieged took\r\ncounsel among themselves about descending to the earth.  They were\r\nsorely tired of the positions which they had been so long constrained to\r\nkeep; for, to tell the truth, sitting astride upon the hard branch of a\r\ntree, though easy enough for a short spell, becomes in time so painful\r\nas to be almost unendurable.  Caspar especially had grown impatient of\r\nthis irksome inaction; and highly exasperated at the _rogue_ who was\r\nforcing it upon them.  Several times had he been on the point of\r\nforsaking his perch, and stealing down for his gun; but Karl, each time\r\nperceiving his design, very prudently persuaded him to forego it.\r\n\r\nAll were anxious enough to get out of the tree; and they would have\r\nvacated their sents at once on the disappearance of their dreaded enemy,\r\nhad they been certain that he was gone for good; but they were\r\nsuspicious that it might be only a temporary absence--perhaps some\r\n_ruse_ of the rogue to decoy them down: for elephants of this character\r\nhave been known to practise tricks with almost as much cunning as rogues\r\namong men.\r\n\r\nWhile holding counsel as to how they had best act, Ossaroo cut short\r\ntheir deliberations by volunteering to descend first; and by stealing a\r\nshort way along the track which the elephant had taken, ascertain\r\nwhether he was really gone from the ground, or only tying in ambush near\r\nthe skirt of the forest.\r\n\r\nAs the shikaree could creep through underwood as silently as a snake,\r\nthere could be no great danger in his doing this, provided he did not go\r\ntoo far.  He could not fail to see the elephant before approaching too\r\nnear to it; and in the event of its turning and pursuing him, he could\r\nonce more flee to their tree-fortress.\r\n\r\nHe scarcely waited for the consent of his companions; but, immediately\r\nafter conceiving the idea, he let himself down among the branches; and\r\nonce on the ground, glided hurriedly, but cautiously, off in the\r\ndirection taken by the elephant.\r\n\r\nKarl and Caspar stayed some five minutes longer upon their perch; but\r\nthe shikaree not returning as soon as they had expected, they became\r\nimpatient, and also dropped down from the tree.\r\n\r\nTheir first act was to recover their guns, and reload them; and then,\r\ntaking stand in a position from which, in case of being suddenly\r\nattacked, they could easily spring back among the branches, they awaited\r\nthe return of Ossaroo.\r\n\r\nA considerable time elapsed, without their either seeing or hearing\r\naught of the shikaree.  Indeed they heard nothing: for a complete\r\nsilence reigned around them, broken only now and then by the fluttering\r\nof the wings of the old male hornbill--who was still keeping in the\r\nneighbourhood of the nest, apparently puzzled to make out by what\r\nmysterious combination of circumstances he had been so abruptly\r\ndisembarrassed of his adversary, the panda.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the bird had no longer any interest for Karl and\r\nCaspar--who were beginning to grow uneasy at the prolonged absence of\r\nOssaroo.\r\n\r\nSoon after, however, they were relieved from their suspense, by seeing\r\nthe shikaree emerging from the underwood, and advancing at a quick pace\r\nto the open ground.  They had the additional pleasure of beholding Fritz\r\nfollowing at his heels.  The dog had joined Ossaroo near the edge of the\r\ntimber--where he had been quietly secreting himself from the eyes of the\r\ndreaded elephant.\r\n\r\nAs Ossaroo drew near, both Karl and Caspar noticed an expression upon\r\nhis countenance, which, combined with his hurried advance, told that he\r\nhad something of an important nature to communicate.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ossy,\" asked Caspar, who was the first to speak, \"what news?\r\nHave you seen anything more of the rogue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, rogue indeed!\" replied Ossaroo, in a tone expressive of some secret\r\nfear.  \"You speakee true, sahib; the rogue, if he no worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what now?  Have you seen anything since you left us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seen, sahibs!  Where you tinkee he now gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hee go for de hut.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the hut?\"\r\n\r\n\"Straight trackee.  Ah, sahibs!\" continued the shikaree, speaking in a\r\nlow voice and with an air of superstitious terror; \"dat animal too wise\r\nfor dis world; he know too much.  I fear him be no elephan' after all,\r\nbut only de devil, who hab takee elephan' shape.  Why he go back there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! why, I wonder,\" inquired Caspar.  \"Do you think,\" added he, \"it is\r\nin the hope of finding us there?  If that's his purpose,\" he continued,\r\nwithout waiting for a reply, \"we shall have no peace so long as he\r\nremains alive.  We must either kill him, or he will do as much for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sahibs,\" observed the Hindoo, with a significant shake of the head, \"we\r\nno able killee him; that elephan' he nebba die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense, Ossy!  If that's what you mean,\" rejoined Caspar,\r\ndisdainfully repudiating the superstitious belief of the shikaree;\r\n\"there is not much doubt of our being able to kill him, if we once get a\r\nfair shot; and by my word, the sooner we set about it the better.  It's\r\nevident, from his having gone back to our hut, that he has some wicked\r\ndesign.  Very likely he remembers being first attacked there by Fritz;\r\nand as he may be under the belief that the dog has retreated there, he\r\nis gone in search of him.  Ho, Fritz, old fellow! you needn't be afraid.\r\nYou can easily get out of his way, whenever you like.  Your masters are\r\nin more danger than you, my boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure, Ossaroo,\" said Karl, who had stood for some time silently\r\nreflecting, \"you are sure he has gone to the hut?\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to this interrogation, Ossaroo would not state positively that\r\nhe had seen the elephant arrive on the very spot where the hovel stood;\r\nbut he had followed his track through the belt of heavy timber; and\r\nthen, having climbed a tree, had descried the great quadruped moving in\r\nthe direction of the hut.  He had no doubt it was for that point he was\r\nmaking, though with what design Ossaroo could not guess--his\r\nsuperstitious dread having hindered him from venturing upon any\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\n\"One thing is clear,\" said Karl, after another interval spent in\r\nreflection: \"it will be no list our attempting to continue the survey we\r\nhave commenced, until the elephant be got out of the way.  What you say,\r\nbrother Caspar, is quite true.  Now that he has become aware of our\r\npresence, and has, moreover, been roused to fury by the wounds we have\r\ngiven him, it is not likely he will forget what has passed; and we can\r\nhope for neither peace nor safety till we have succeeded in destroying\r\nhim.  There is no reason why we should not set about it at once, but\r\nevery reason why we should.  Our very lives depend upon his destruction;\r\nand they will not be safe till that has been accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us after him at once, then,\" cried Caspar; \"and be our motto,\r\n`_Death to the rogue_'!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nA HOME IN RUINS.\r\n\r\nWithout further delay, our adventurers took the back track towards the\r\nhut, which was exactly that which the elephant had taken--as they could\r\ntell by traces of the animal all along the route, which the experienced\r\neye of the shikaree had already discovered, and which he now pointed out\r\nto his companions as they passed on.  Here and there its great\r\nfootprints were visible in the turf, in places where the ground was\r\nsoft; and at other places where no tracks appeared, leaves and twigs\r\nfreshly strewn upon the earth, and also branches of considerable size\r\nbroken off from the trees, and borne for some distance before being\r\ndropped, clearly indicated to Ossaroo the route which the rogue had\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe shikaree had often followed the spoor of wild elephants through the\r\njungles of Bengal, and knew everything about their way of travelling.\r\nHe was therefore able to tell the others that the rogue had not been\r\nbrowsing as he went--for the leaves and twigs showed no signs of his\r\nteeth--but on the contrary, he had moved forward rapidly, and as if with\r\nsome special determination.  The broken branches which they saw were\r\nmore likely to have been torn off out of spite at the ill-usage he had\r\nreceived, and the disappointment at not having succeeded in his purposes\r\nof vengeance.\r\n\r\nIt did not need for Ossaroo to caution his companions to circumspection.\r\nThey knew as well as he that an elephant enraged as this one was,\r\nwhether a _rogue_ elephant or an _honest_ one, was anything but a safe\r\ncustomer to come in contact with; and that this particular rogue was\r\nmost particularly angry they had just had both ocular and auricular\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThey went forward, therefore, with unusual caution, taking care to keep\r\nboth their eyes and ears on the alert, and at the same time moving in\r\nperfect silence, or conversing only in whispers.\r\n\r\nThe path upon which they were returning was not that by which they had\r\ngone forth.  The reconnoissance of the cliffs had carried them a good\r\ndistance around the edge of the valley; but now they were following the\r\ntrack taken by the elephant, which, as already ascertained by Ossaroo,\r\nled almost in a direct line to the hut.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer to their rude habitation, they saw indications that\r\nthe enemy was still before them.  As they knew that in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the hot-spring, and consequently of the hut itself,\r\nthere were no large trees or other place of safety to which they might\r\nretreat in case of being again attacked, they began to advance with\r\nincreased caution.  From the direction in which they were approaching,\r\nthe hovel could not be seen until they should get within less than two\r\nhundred yards of it.  There was a belt of rather tall jungle to be\r\npassed through, and then it would be in sight.\r\n\r\nThrough this jungle they commenced advancing; and there, to their no\r\nslight uneasiness, they also observed fresh traces of the elephant.\r\nThey were now certain that he had passed through it before them, still\r\ngoing direct for the hut.\r\n\r\nWhat on earth can he want there? was the query that once more suggested\r\nitself to the minds of all three.  It certainly looked as if he had\r\nproceeded there in search of _them_!  As if, missing them from the scene\r\nof the encounter, he believed they had returned home, and was following\r\nup their acquaintance.\r\n\r\nFrom what they had observed, they could not help attributing to the\r\ngreat quadruped the possession of an intelligence something more than\r\nnatural; and this, though it may have been only an absurd fancy on their\r\npart, had the effect of begetting within their minds a very painful\r\nfeeling of apprehension.  What they saw on coming out on the other side\r\nof the jungle not only strengthened this feeling of apprehension, but\r\nincreased it all at once to a positive terror.\r\n\r\nThe hut, which should now have been before their eyes, and at a distance\r\nof not quite two hundred paces, _was no longer there_!  The ruins of it\r\nalone were visible.  The large boulders with which its walls had been\r\nbuilt, the beams and thatch that had composed its roof, the grass\r\ncouches upon which they had slept, the rude improvised utensils and\r\nother articles which had served them for furniture, were all strewed far\r\nand wide over the ground; and not the semblance of a house, or even\r\nhovel, remained to show that the spot had been occupied by a human\r\nhabitation!\r\n\r\nYes--in what had been their rude dwelling our adventurers beheld only a\r\nruder ruin--scarce one stone standing upon, another!\r\n\r\nThey beheld all this with feelings of fear--ay, something stronger--with\r\nawe.  The Pagan worshipper of Brahma or Vishnu was no longer alone in\r\nhis superstitious imaginings.  His young Christian companions were\r\nalmost equally victims to a belief in the supernatural.  They\r\ncomprehended well enough what had caused the destruction of the house.\r\nThough the author of that mischief was nowhere to be seen, they knew it\r\nwas the elephant.  There was no alternative but to accept that\r\nexplanation; and it was not the act itself that was awing them, but the\r\ncontemplation of the human-like, or rather demon-like, intelligence that\r\nhad guided the animal thither, and instructed it to this act of\r\nretribution, perhaps only preliminary to a still greater one.\r\n\r\nThough the work of devastation could not have been completed many\r\nminutes before their arrival, the elephant appeared to have gone away\r\nfrom the ground.  At east, it was not to be seen anywhere near the spot;\r\nand it is needless to say that it was carefully looked for.  Dreading\r\nits dangerous proximity, they had kept under cover of the bushes while\r\ncontemplating the ruin from a distance; and it was not until after a\r\nconsiderable interval had elapsed that they ventured forward over the\r\nopen space to ascertain the full extent of the damage.\r\n\r\nThis they at length did, and found that it was _total_ destruction.  So\r\nfar as the hut was concerned, not a vestige of construction remained--\r\nwalls and roof had been alike levelled with the ground.  But what was a\r\ngreater source of chagrin to the now homeless plant-hunters, was that\r\ntheir little store of ammunition--the gunpowder, which during all the\r\nperiod of their imprisonment they had been carefully hoarding--was\r\nspilled among the rubbish, and of course irrecoverable.  It had been\r\ndeposited in a large gourd-shell prepared for the purpose; and this,\r\namong other similar chattels, the enraged quadruped had crushed under\r\nits feet.  Their cured provisions had also been turned out from their\r\nplace of deposit, and trampled into the dust of the earth.  But this,\r\nthough also a chagrin, was one of less bitterness.  Other provisions\r\nmight be obtained--not now so easily, since the powder was destroyed--\r\nbut the latter they could not replace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nUP A TREE AGAIN!\r\n\r\nThey might have remained longer on the ground lamenting this irreparable\r\nloss, but that they were still apprehensive of the return of the\r\nelephant.  Whither had it gone?  That was the question which one was\r\naddressing to the other, while the eyes of all kept turning in different\r\ndirections, and with glances that betrayed their uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe rogue could not have been off the ground more than a very few\r\nminutes: the grass that he had trampled down was still wet with its own\r\nsap, crushed out by his ponderous weight.  And yet he might have been\r\nseen all around for nearly a quarter of a mile's distance.  There was no\r\ntimber within that distance that could have given concealment to an\r\nanimal so bulky as an elephant?\r\n\r\nSo thought Karl and Caspar; but Ossaroo was of a different opinion.  The\r\nbit of jungle through which they had passed would suffice to screen the\r\nrogue, said he: adding at the same time a piece of intelligence derived\r\nfrom his shikaree experience: that an elephant, large as it is, can hide\r\nin a slight cover with wonderful cunning; that its sagacity enables it\r\nto select the best place for concealment; and that, although it neither\r\ncrouches nor squats, it contrives, by keeping perfectly still--added to\r\nthe circumstance of its being a shapeless sort of mass--ofttimes to\r\nelude the eye of the most vigilant hunter.  Though Karl and Caspar could\r\nscarcely credit him, Ossaroo expressed his belief, not only that the\r\nelephant might be hid in the scant jungle they were talking about, but\r\nthat it actually _was_ there.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for them, Ossaroo's argument was too soon to be supported\r\nby facts which left no doubt of its accuracy.  As they stood scanning\r\nthe jungle with keen glances, and with ears acutely bent to catch every\r\nsound that might issue from it, a movement was perceptible among the\r\ntops of some tall saplings that grew near its centre.  In the next\r\nmoment a brace of the beautiful argus pheasants rose on whirring wing,\r\nat the same time giving forth their loud note of alarm.\r\n\r\nThe birds, forsaking the jungle, in their flight passed over the heads\r\nof our adventurers, and by their cries caused such a clangour as to set\r\nFritz off into a prolonged fit of baying.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that the enemy had been only lying in ambush, waiting for\r\na good opportunity to charge, or whether the voice of the dog--already\r\nknown and hated--had been just then heard by the elephant, stirring him\r\nto a fresh thirst for vengeance, certain it is, that before a sentence\r\ncould be exchanged among the terrified trio, the long conical trunk and\r\nbroad massive shoulders were visible through the scanty jungle; and it\r\nwas plain to all that the monster was making towards them with that\r\ndeceptive shamble which, though only a walk, carries the huge quadruped\r\nover the ground almost with the speed of a galloping horse.\r\n\r\nFor a moment our adventurers stood their ground--not, however, with any\r\nidea of awaiting the attack or attempting to repel it; but simply\r\nbecause they knew not in what direction to retreat.\r\n\r\nSo dismayed were they at the sight of the advancing enemy, that it was\r\nsome seconds before any of the three could suggest a plan that offered a\r\nprospect of escape.  Rather mechanically than otherwise did Karl and\r\nCaspar bring their pieces to the level, with the intention of firing in\r\nthe face of the foe: for they had but little hope that the lead from\r\ntheir guns, both of light calibre, would stop his impetuous charge.\r\nBoth fired at the same instant; and then Caspar delivered his second\r\nshot; but, just as they had expected, the elephant continued to charge\r\nonward.\r\n\r\nFortunately for them, the shikaree had not condescended to draw the\r\nstring of his bow.  Experience had taught him that under such\r\ncircumstances an arrow was an useless weapon.  He might as well have\r\nattempted to kick the elephant, or stick a pin into its trunk; either of\r\nwhich proceedings would have damaged the animal nearly as much, and\r\nperhaps irritated it a little less, than would one of Ossaroo's arrows.\r\nKnowing this, the shikaree, instead of bothering himself with his bow,\r\nor wasting time by any thoughts of resistance, had occupied the few\r\nseconds left for consideration in a rapid reconnoissance of the\r\nneighbourhood--to see if it offered any chance of escape.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, the vicinity appeared rather unpromising.  The cliffs\r\noffered no ledge upon which they might have climbed out of reach of the\r\nrogue, the jungle might have afforded them a temporary shelter; but\r\nalthough it had concealed the elephant from their eyes, it could not\r\nlong conceal them from the eyes of such a sagacious creature as their\r\nantagonist appeared to be.  Besides, the elephant was between them and\r\nit, and to retreat in that direction would be to run point blank upon\r\nits proboscis!\r\n\r\nFortunately in this moment of uncertainty and irresolution a point of\r\nsafety appeared to the eye of the shikaree, in the shape of a tree--the\r\nonly one near the spot.  It was a tree that had already been\r\ninstrumental in saving his life: for it was the same that stood by the\r\nlittle straits where Ossaroo had set his nets, and by means of which\r\nCaspar had been enabled to hoist him up out of the quicksand.\r\n\r\nThis tree was a very large one; and standing alone, its branches, free\r\nto extend their growth, had spread far out in every direction, almost\r\nstretching across the straits.\r\n\r\nOssaroo wasted not the precious moments in idle reflection, but shouting\r\nto the young sahibs, and signalling them to follow his example, he\r\nstruck off towards the tree with all the speed that lay in his legs; and\r\nnot till he had got up to the third or fourth tier of branches did he\r\nlook behind him, to see whether his advice had been taken.\r\n\r\nThe young sahibs had adopted his suggestion with alacrity, without\r\nstaying a moment to question its propriety; and both were up the tree\r\nalmost as soon as the shikaree himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nAN IMPLACABLE BESIEGER.\r\n\r\nFritz had retreated with his masters as far as the bottom of the tree;\r\nbut possessing only canine claws, he was not a climber; and of course\r\ncould follow them no further.  But if he could not ascend the tree, he\r\nhad no intention of remaining under it--when he saw no chance of\r\navoiding the vengeance of the elephant--and, without pausing for a\r\nmoment, he plunged into the water, and swam across the straits.  Then\r\nwading out on the the opposite bank, he scuttled off into a cover of\r\nreeds which grew along the shore of the lake, and there concealed\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThis time the elephant paid no attention to the dog.  It was upon the\r\nhunters alone that its eyes were fixed; and towards them its vindictive\r\ndesigns were now specially directed.  It had been close upon their\r\nheels, as they ran over the open ground, and distinctly saw them\r\nascending into the tree.  Indeed, so near was it, that both Karl and\r\nCaspar were once more obliged to let go their guns, in order that they\r\nmight have both hands free for climbing.  Otherwise they might have been\r\ntoo late to get out of reach, and the least delay on their part might\r\nhave been fatal to one or both.\r\n\r\nKarl was the last to climb up; and just as he lifted his feet from a\r\nbranch to set them on one higher up, the rogue twisted his trunk around\r\nthe former, and snapped it in two, as if it had been only a slender\r\nreed.\r\n\r\nBut Karl, with the others, was now beyond his reach; and all three\r\ncongratulated themselves on once more having escaped from a danger that\r\nwas nothing short of death itself.\r\n\r\nIf possible, the elephant was now more enraged than ever.  It had not\r\nonly been a second time baulked in its vengeance, but had received three\r\nfresh bullet-wounds; which, though mere scratches upon the skin of its\r\nhuge cranium, were sore enough to irritate it to an extreme degree.\r\nUttering its shrill, trumpet-like screech, it flourished its proboscis\r\nhigh in the air; and seizing the branches that were within its reach, it\r\nsnapped them off from the main stem as if they had been tiny twigs.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the tree, which had been furnished with low-spreading\r\nlimbs, was completely stripped of these to a height of nearly\r\ntwenty-feet from the ground; while the space underneath had become\r\nstrewn with twigs, leaves, and broken branches, crushed into a litter\r\nunder the broad, ponderous hooves of the mammoth as he kept moving\r\nincessantly over them.\r\n\r\nNot content with stripping the tree of its branches, the old tusker\r\nseized hold of its trunk--lapping his own _trunk_ as far as he could\r\naround it--and commenced tugging at it, as if he had hopes of being able\r\nto drag it up by the roots.\r\n\r\nPerceiving after trial that this feat was beyond his power, he relaxed\r\nhis hold, and then set about another experiment--that of pushing down\r\nthe tree with his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAlthough he succeeded in causing the tree to tremble, he soon became\r\nsatisfied that it stood firm enough to resist all his strength, great as\r\nit was: and under this conviction he at length desisted from the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nHe showed no sign, however, of any intention to leave the ground; but,\r\non the contrary, took his stand under the tree: since the very opposite\r\nwas the determination which he had formed in his mind.\r\n\r\nAlthough confident that they were in security, our adventurers were\r\nanything but exultant.  They saw that they were only safe for the time;\r\nand, that although their dreaded adversary might after a while withdraw\r\nand leave them free to descend, still there could be no security for the\r\nfuture.  They had now less hope of being able to destroy this powerful\r\nenemy: as they had only one charge left for their guns, and that might\r\nnot be sufficient to take away his life.  The spilling of their powder\r\nby the elephant itself seemed like a piece of strategy on his part,\r\nleaving them in a sad dilemma.\r\n\r\nInside any house they might build, they would be no better protected\r\nagainst him than on the open ground: for the rogue had proved himself\r\ncapable of demolishing the strongest walls they might construct; and to\r\nbe out of his reach, they would be obliged to keep eternally among the\r\ntops of the trees, and lead the life of monkeys or squirrels--which\r\nwould be a very disagreeable kind of existence.\r\n\r\nJust then an idea occurred to Caspar that offered them an alternative to\r\nthis unpleasant prospect of an arboreal life.  He bethought him of the\r\ncave in which they had killed the bear.  It could only be reached by a\r\nladder, and would of course be inaccessible to the elephant.  Once out\r\nof their present dilemma, they might seek refuge there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nDRAWING THEIR DRINK.\r\n\r\nThe idea about the cave was a good one, and gave them some little\r\ncomfort in the midst of their tribulation.\r\n\r\nStill, it was not much; for although they would be safe enough while in\r\nthe cavern, they could not accomplish anything there.  The want of light\r\nwould hinder them from working at the ladders; and while cutting the\r\ntimber out of which to make them, and every hour that they might be\r\nengaged upon them, they would be exposed to the attacks of their\r\nimplacable enemy.\r\n\r\nThe prospect was sufficiently discouraging--even with the knowledge that\r\nthe cave would offer them a safe asylum to which they could retreat\r\nwhenever pursued.\r\n\r\nAs the elephant remained comparatively tranquil for a length of time,\r\nthese thoughts of future operations had engaged their attention.\r\nConfident in their present security, they were not troubled by the fear\r\nof any immediate danger.\r\n\r\nVery soon, however, this confidence began to forsake them.  How long\r\nwere they going to be kept in the tree?  That was a question that now\r\npresented itself; and as the time passed, became a source of uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThough none of them could answer this question, yet all could understand\r\nthat the siege promised to be a long one--perhaps much longer than that\r\nwhich had so lately been raised: for the rogue, inspired by a rage\r\nprofound and implacable, exhibited in his sullen look a determination to\r\nstand his ground for an indefinite period of time.  Seeing this, our\r\nadventurers once more became uneasy.  Not only was their situation\r\nirksome--from the fact of their having to sit astride slender branches--\r\nbut should the siege be continued, they would be subjected to that\r\ndanger peculiar to all people besieged--the danger of starvation.  Even\r\nat the outset all three were as hungry as wolves.  They had eaten but a\r\nvery light breakfast, and nothing since: for they had not found time to\r\ncook dinner.  It was now late in the afternoon; and should the enemy\r\ncontinue there all night, they would have to go to bed supperless.  Ah!\r\nto bed indeed.  Perhaps there would be neither bed nor sleep that night:\r\nfor how could they slumber upon those hard branches?  Should they lose\r\nconsciousness for a moment, they would drop off, and tumble down upon\r\ntheir sleepless besieger!  Even should they tie themselves in the tree,\r\nto go to sleep upon such narrow couches would be out of the question.\r\n\r\nThus, then, they saw no prospect of either supper or sleep for that\r\nnight.  But there was another appetite now annoying them far worse than\r\neither hunger or longing for sleep.  It was the desire to drink.  The\r\nrough and varied exercise which they had been compelled to take since\r\nstarting in the morning--climbing trees, and skulking through pathless\r\njungles--combined with the varied emotions which their repeated perils\r\nhad called up--all had a tendency to produce thirst; and thirst they now\r\nfelt in an extreme degree.  It was not lessened by the sight of the\r\nwater shining beneath them.  On the contrary, this only increased the\r\ncraving to an extent that was almost unendurable.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time they bore the pain, without any hope of being\r\nable to get relieved of it; and with the lake glistening before their\r\neyes under the clear sunlight, and the current gently gliding through\r\nthe straits underneath, they could realise, in something more than\r\nfancy, what must have been the terrible sufferings of poor Tantalus.\r\n\r\nAfter submitting to this infliction for a considerable length of time,\r\nan exclamation escaping from Caspar drew upon him the attention of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"Dunder und blitzen!\" cried he; \"what have we been thinking about all\r\nthis time?  The three of us sitting here choking with thirst, and a\r\nriver of water within our reach!\"\r\n\r\n\"Within our reach?  I wish it were, Caspar,\" rejoined Karl, in rather a\r\ndesponding tone.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it is within our reach.  Look here!\"\r\n\r\nAs Caspar spoke, he held out his copper powder-flask, now nearly empty.\r\nKarl did not yet quite comprehend him.\r\n\r\n\"What is to hinder us from letting this down,\" he inquired, \"and drawing\r\nit up again full of water?  Nothing.  Have you a piece of string about\r\nyou, Ossy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sahib, I have,\" briskly replied the shikaree, at the same time\r\ndrawing a roll of hempen twist out of the breast of his cotton shirt,\r\nand holding it out towards the young hunter.\r\n\r\n\"Long enough, it is,\" said Caspar, taking the cord; which the next\r\nmoment he attached around the neck of the flask.  After pouring the\r\npowder into his bullet-pouch, he permitted the flask to drop down till\r\nit became immersed under the current.  Allowing it to remain there, till\r\nit had become filled with water, he drew it up again; and with a\r\ncongratulatory exclamation presented it to Karl, telling him to drink to\r\nhis heart's content.  This injunction Karl obeyed without the slightest\r\nreluctance.\r\n\r\nThe flask was soon emptied; and once more let down and re-filled, and\r\nagain emptied; and this series of operations was continued, until all\r\nwere satisfied, and there was no longer a thirsty individual in the top\r\nof that tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nA GIGANTIC SYRINGE.\r\n\r\nHaving by Caspar's ingenious artifice obtained as much water as they\r\nwanted, the besieged felt better able to endure their irksome situation.\r\nThey were resigning themselves with as much philosophy as they could\r\ncommand to bear it a little longer, when to their great astonishment\r\nthey were treated to more water than they wanted, and from a source as\r\ncurious as was unexpected.\r\n\r\nWhether the elephant had taken a hint from seeing the flask plunged down\r\ninto the water, or whether the idea had occurred to it without being\r\nsuggested by anything in particular, it would be difficult to say.\r\nCertain it is, that just after the last flask-full had been pulled up,\r\nand before the eddying ripples had subsided from the surface, the rogue\r\nwas seen to make a rush into the water, at the same time deeply\r\nsubmerging his proboscis, as if about to take a drink.\r\n\r\nFor some moments he remained in a stationary attitude, apparently\r\nfilling his capacious stomach with the fluid.\r\n\r\nThere was no reason why he should not be as thirsty as themselves; and\r\nthe spectators in the tree had no other thought, than that the great\r\nquadruped had waded into the pool simply for the purpose of quenching\r\nhis thirst.\r\n\r\nThere was something about his movements, however, and the style in which\r\nhe had set about sucking up the water, which betrayed a different\r\ndetermination; and it was not long before this was evinced by a\r\nperformance which, under other circumstances, might have evoked laughter\r\nfrom those who witnessed it.  In this instance, however, the spectators\r\nwere themselves the victims of the joke--if joke it might be termed--and\r\nduring its continuance, not one of the three felt the slightest\r\ninclination to indulge in mirth.  It was thus that the elephant acted:--\r\n\r\nHaving filled its trunk with the water of the stream, it raised it\r\naloft.  Then pointing it towards the tree, and even directing it with as\r\nmuch coolness and precision as an astronomer would have used in\r\nadjusting his telescope, it sent the fluid in a drenching stream into\r\nthe faces of the three individuals whom it was holding in siege.  All\r\nthree, who chanced to be sitting close together, were at the same\r\ninstant, and alike, the victims of this unexpected deluge; and before\r\nany of them could have counted half a score, they were wet from head to\r\nfoot, every rag upon their backs, and fronts too, becoming as thoroughly\r\nsaturated as if they had been exposed for hours to a drenching rain\r\nstorm!\r\n\r\nBut the elephant was not satisfied with giving them a single\r\nshower-bath.  As soon as its first supply was exhausted, it once more\r\nimmersed its pliant sucker, re-filled the reservoir, took a good aim,\r\nand ejected the fluid into their faces.\r\n\r\nIn this way the creature continued drawing up the water from the stream,\r\nand squirting it from its vast muscular syringe, until it had douched\r\nthem nearly a dozen times.\r\n\r\nTheir situation was anything but enviable; for the watery stream,\r\npropelled against them with as much force as from the hose-pipe of a\r\nfire-engine, almost washed them from their unstable seats; to say\r\nnothing of the great discomfort which the douche occasioned them.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to guess what could be the object of the elephant\r\nin this curious performance.  Perhaps it may have conceived a hope\r\neither of driving them out of the tree, or forcibly washing them from\r\nthe branches; or perhaps it merely designed to make their situation as\r\nuncomfortable as possible, and thus to some extent satisfy its spite.\r\n\r\nIt would be equally difficult to tell how long the performance might\r\nhave lasted.  Perhaps for hours longer--since the supply of water was\r\ninexhaustible; but it was brought to a conclusion which neither the\r\ngreat pachyderm himself foresaw, nor they who were the subjects of his\r\naqueous dispensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nSWALLOWED WHOLESALE.\r\n\r\nJust while it was in the midst of its performance, keeping its\r\n_water-battery_ in full play, and apparently with malicious enjoyment,\r\nit was seen all at once to desist; and then its huge body commenced\r\nrocking from side to side, one shoulder now upheaving, then the other,\r\nwhile the long trunk was swept in circles through the air, at the same\r\ntime emitting, instead of water, shrill sounds that proclaimed either\r\npain or terror.\r\n\r\nWhat could it mean?  The quadruped was evidently smitten with some\r\nsudden fear; but who and what was the enemy it dreaded?  So mentally\r\ninquired Karl and Caspar; but before either had time to shape his\r\nthought into an interrogative speech, the shikaree had answered it.\r\n\r\n\"He-ho!\" he exclaimed.  \"Goot! vair goot!--praise to the God of the\r\nGreat Gangee!  See, sahibs, the rogue he go down, down--he sinkee in de\r\nquicksand that near swalley Ossaroo; he-ho; sinkee! he sinkee!\"\r\n\r\nKarl and Caspar easily comprehended the meaning of Ossaroo's broken but\r\nexultant speeches.  Bending their eyes on the brute below, and watching\r\nits movements, they at once perceived that the shikaree had spoken the\r\ntruth.  The elephant was evidently sinking in the quicksand!\r\n\r\nThey had noticed that when it first entered the bed of the stream, the\r\nwater had not reached far above its knees.  Now it was up to its sides,\r\nand slowly but gradually rising higher.  Its violent struggles,\r\nmoreover--the partial and alternate raising of its shoulders, its\r\nexcited shrieks--and the proboscis, rapidly extended now to this side,\r\nnow to that, as if searching to grasp some support--all proved the truth\r\nof Ossaroo's assertion--the rogue was sinking in the quicksand.  And\r\nrapidly was the creature going down.  Before the spectators had been\r\nwatching it five minutes, the water lapped up nearly to the level of its\r\nback, and then inch by inch, and foot by foot, it rose higher, until the\r\nround shoulders were submerged, and only the head and its long\r\ntrumpet-like extension appeared above the surface.\r\n\r\nSoon the shoulders ceased to play; and the vast body exhibited no other\r\nmotion, save that gentle descent by which it was being drawn down into\r\nthe bowels of the earth!\r\n\r\nThe trunk still kept up its vibratory movement, now violently beating\r\nthe water into foam, and now feebly oscillating, all the while breathing\r\nforth its accents of agony.\r\n\r\nAt length the upturned head and smooth protuberant jaws sank beneath the\r\nsurface; and only the proboscis appeared, standing erect out of the\r\nwater like a gigantic Bologna sausage.  It had ceased to give out the\r\nshrill trumpet scream; but a loud breathing could still be heard,\r\ninterrupted at intervals by a gurgling sound.\r\n\r\nKarl and Caspar kept their seats upon the tree, looking down upon the\r\nstrange scene with feelings of awe depicted in their faces.  Not so the\r\nshikaree, who was no longer aloft.  As soon as he had seen the elephant\r\nfairly locked in the deadly embrace of that quicksand that had so nearly\r\nengulfed his own precious person, he lowered himself nimbly down from\r\nthe branches.\r\n\r\nFor some moments he stood upon the bank, watching the futile efforts\r\nwhich the animal was making to free itself, all the while talking to it,\r\nand taunting it with spiteful speeches--for Ossaroo had been\r\nparticularly indignant at the loss of his skirt.  When at length the\r\nlast twelve inches of the elephant's trunk was all that remained above\r\nthe surface, the shikaree could hold back no longer.  Drawing his long\r\nknife, he rushed out into the water; and, with one clean cut, severed\r\nthe muscular mass from its supporting stem, as a sickle would have\r\nlevelled some soft succulent weed.\r\n\r\nThe parted tube sank instantly to the bottom; a few red bubbles rose to\r\nthe surface; and these were the last tokens that proclaimed the exit of\r\nthat great elephant from the surface of the earth.  It had gone down\r\ninto the deep sands, there to become fossilised--perhaps after the lapse\r\nof many ages to be turned up again by the spade and pick-axe of some\r\nwondering quarry-man.\r\n\r\nThus by a singular accident were our adventurers disembarrassed of a\r\ndisagreeable neighbour--or rather, a dangerous enemy--so dangerous,\r\nindeed, that had not some chance of the kind turned up in their favour,\r\nit is difficult to conjecture how they would have got rid of it.  It was\r\nno longer a question of pouring bullets into its body, and killing it in\r\nthat way.  The spilling of their powder had spoiled that project; and\r\nthe three charges that still remained to them might not have been\r\nsufficient with guns of so small a calibre as theirs.\r\n\r\nNo doubt in time such gallant hunters as Caspar and Ossaroo, and so\r\ningenious a contriver as Karl, would have devised some way to circumvent\r\nthe rogue, and make an end of him; but for all that they were very well\r\npleased at the strange circumstance that had relieved them of the\r\nnecessity, and they congratulated themselves on such a fortunate result.\r\n\r\nOn hearing them talking together, and perceiving that they were no\r\nlonger in the tree, Fritz, who had all this while been skulking only a\r\nfew paces from the spot, now emerged from his hiding-place, and came\r\nrunning up.  Little did Fritz suspect, while swimming across the straits\r\nto rejoin his masters, that the huge quadruped which had so frequently\r\ngiven him chase was at that moment so very near him; and that his own\r\nclaws, while cutting the water, came within an inch of scratching that\r\nterrible trunk, now _truncated_ to a _frustrum_ of its former self!\r\n\r\nBut although Fritz had no knowledge of strange incident that had\r\noccurred during his absence--and may have been wondering in what\r\ndirection the enemy had gone off--while swimming across the straits, the\r\nred colour of the water at a particular place, or more likely the scent\r\nof blood upon it, admonished him that some sanguinary scene had\r\ntranspired; and drew from him a series of excited yelps as he buoyantly\r\nbreasted the wave.\r\n\r\nFritz came in for a share of the congratulations.  Although the faithful\r\ncreature had retreated on each occasion of his being attacked, no one\r\nthought of casting a slur upon his canine courage.  He had only\r\nexhibited a wise discretion: for what chance would he have stood against\r\nsuch a formidable adversary?  He had done better, therefore, by taking\r\nto his heels; for had he foolishly stood his ground, and got killed in\r\nthe first encounter by the obelisk, the elephant might still have been\r\nalive, and besieging them in the tree.  Besides, it was Fritz who had\r\nsounded the first note of warning, and thus given time to prepare for\r\nthe reception of the assailant.\r\n\r\nAll of the party regarded Fritz as worthy of reward; and Ossaroo had\r\nmade up his mind that he should have it, in the shape of a dinner upon\r\nelephant's trunk.  But in wading back into the stream, the shikaree\r\nperceived to his chagrin that the brave dog must be disappointed: since\r\nthe piece which he had so skilfully lopped off, had followed the\r\nfortunes of the part from which it had been severed, and was now far\r\nbelow the surface of the sand!\r\n\r\nOssaroo made no attempt to dig it up again.  He had a wholesome dread of\r\nthat treacherous footing; and treading it gingerly, he lost no time in\r\nreturning to the bank, and following the sahibs--who had already taken\r\ntheir departure from the water's edge, and were proceeding in the\r\ndirection of the ruined hut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE DEODAR.\r\n\r\nThe idea that had occurred to them--of making the cave their home--was\r\nno longer deemed worthy of being entertained.  The dangerous proximity\r\nof the elephant had alone suggested it; and this no longer existed.  It\r\nwas not likely that there was another _rogue_ in the valley.  Indeed,\r\nOssaroo was able to set their minds at rest on this point--assuring them\r\nthat two animals of the kind are never found occupying the same\r\ndistrict: since two creatures of such malignant dispositions would\r\ncertainly enact the tragedy of the Kilkenny cats--though Ossaroo did not\r\nillustrate his meaning by quoting this celebrated expression.\r\n\r\nPossibly there might be other animals in the neighbourhood as much to be\r\ndreaded as the elephant had been.  There might be panthers, or leopards,\r\nor tigers, or even another bear; but against any of these the cave would\r\nbe no safe asylum--not safer than their old hut.  They could reconstruct\r\nit more strongly than ever; and put a stout door upon it to keep out any\r\nmidnight intruder; and to this work did they apply themselves as soon as\r\nthey had eaten dinner, and dried their garments--so thoroughly saturated\r\nby the colossal syringe of the defunct elephant.\r\n\r\nSeveral days were spent in restoring the hovel--this time with\r\nconsiderable improvements.  The winter weather had now fairly set in;\r\nand household warmth had become an important object: so that not only\r\ndid they fill up the chinks with a thick coating of clay, but a\r\nfireplace and chimney were constructed, and a strong door was added.\r\n\r\nThey knew that it would take them a long time to make the ladders--more\r\nthan a dozen long ladders--each of which must be light as a reed and\r\nstraight as an arrow.\r\n\r\nDuring the milder days of winter they might work in the open air;\r\nindeed, the greater part of their work they must needs do outside the\r\nhut.  Still it would be necessary to have shelter not only during the\r\nnights, but in times of storm and severe weather.\r\n\r\nPrudence therefore counselled them to providence; and before proceeding\r\nfarther with their design of scaling the cliff, they made all snug\r\nwithin doors.\r\n\r\nThey had no fear of suffering from the winter's cold--either for want of\r\nclothing by day, or covering by night.  Some of the yak-skins were still\r\nin good preservation--with the pelts of several other animals that had\r\nfallen before the double-barrel of Caspar--and these would suffice for\r\nwarm clothing by day and bed-covering by night.\r\n\r\nAbout their winter's food they were a little more anxious.  The elephant\r\nhad succeeded not only in destroying their means of obtaining\r\nprovisions, but had also damaged the stock which was on hand, by\r\ntrampling it in the mud.  Those portions of the dried venison and\r\nyak-beef that the brute had not succeeded in completely spoiling, were\r\nonce more collected, and stored in a safe place; while it was resolved,\r\nin the event of their not being able to procure more, that they should\r\ngo on rations proportioned to the time which they might have to continue\r\nin their rock-bound prison.  Of course, though their ammunition was\r\nexhausted, they were not without hopes of being able to add to their\r\nstore of provisions.  The arrows of Ossaroo still existed, independent\r\nof either powder or lead.  Snares and traps would enable them to capture\r\nmany of the wild creatures that, like themselves, appeared to have found\r\na prison in that secluded and singular valley.\r\n\r\nWhen all the arrangements regarding their winter residence were\r\ncompleted, they returned once more to the survey of the cliffs, which\r\nhad been interrupted by the elephant.\r\n\r\nAfter a prolonged examination of the ledges, that had been discovered on\r\nthat eventful day, they continued on until they had made the circuit of\r\nthe valley.  Not a foot of the precipice was passed without the most\r\nelaborate inspection being bestowed upon it; and of course the twin\r\ncliffs which hemmed in the gorge of the glacier were examined with the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThere proved to be no place offering such advantages for an ascent by\r\nladders as that already discovered; and although there was no positive\r\ncertainty that they might be able to accomplish their formidable task,\r\nthey determined to make a trial, and without further delay set about\r\npreparing the ladders.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary step was to select and cut down a sufficient quantity of\r\ntimber of the right length.  They were about to have recourse to the\r\nbeautiful Thibet pine--the sort which had served them for bridging the\r\ncrevasse--when a new tree was discovered by them, equally beautiful, and\r\nmore suitable for their purpose.  It was the cedar (_Pinus deodara_).\r\nOssaroo once more lamented the absence of his beloved bamboos--alleging\r\nthat with a sufficient number of these he could have made ladders enough\r\nfor scaling the cliff, in less than a quarter of the time it would take\r\nto construct them out of the pines.  This was no exaggeration: for the\r\nculm of the great bamboo, just as it is cut out of the brake, serves for\r\nthe side of a ladder, without any pains taken with it, further than to\r\nnotch out the holes in which to insert the rounds.  Moreover, the bamboo\r\nbeing light, would have served better than any other timber for such\r\nladders as they required--enabling them with less trouble to get them\r\nhoisted up to the ledges--an operation in which they apprehended no\r\nlittle difficulty.  But although there was a species of cane growing in\r\nthe valley--that known to the hill people as the \"ringall\"--its culms\r\nwere neither of sufficient length nor thickness for their purpose.  It\r\nwas the great bamboo of the tropical jungles that Ossaroo sighed for;\r\nand which on their way up through the lower ranges of the Himalayas they\r\nhad seen growing in vast brakes, its tall stems often rising to the\r\nheight of a hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe deodar, under favourable circumstances, attains to vast dimensions,\r\ntrunks being often met with in the mountains upwards of ten feet in\r\ndiameter, and rising to the height of one hundred feet.  A few sticks of\r\nthis description would have made their labour both short and easy.\r\n\r\nFailing the bamboo, therefore, they selected the second best material\r\nwhich the forest afforded them--the tall \"deodar.\"  This tree, which is\r\nknown to the Anglo-Indian residents of the Himalayan countries as the\r\n\"cedar,\" has long since been introduced into English parks and\r\narboretums, under the name of _deodara_--its specific botanical\r\nappellation.  It is a true pine and is found in most of the hills and\r\nvalleys of the Himalayan chain, growing at almost any elevation and on\r\nany kind of ground--in the low warm valleys, as well as near the line of\r\neverlasting snow.  Its favourite habitat, however, is on the lower\r\nhills, and though by no means a beautiful tree, it is valuable on\r\naccount of the great quantity of tar which can be extracted from its\r\nsap.\r\n\r\nWhere many deodar trees are growing together, they shoot up in long\r\ntapering shafts, with short branches, and present the acute conical form\r\ncharacteristic of the pines.  When individual trees stand singly, or at\r\nsome considerable distance apart, their habit is different.  They then\r\nstretch out long massive arms in a horizontal direction; and as the\r\nseparate twigs and leaves also extend horizontally, each branch thus\r\npresents a surface as level as a table.  The deodar often reaches the\r\nheight of one hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the deodar is everywhere esteemed throughout the countries\r\nwhere it is found.  It is excellent for building purposes, easily\r\nworked, almost imperishable, and can be readily split into planks--an\r\nindispensable requisite in a country where saws are almost unknown.  In\r\nCashmere, bridges are built of it: and the long time that some of these\r\nhave been standing, affords a proof of its great durability.  A portion\r\nof these bridges are under water for more than half the year; and\r\nalthough there are some of them nearly a hundred years old, they are\r\nstill in good preservation, and safe enough to be crossed.\r\n\r\nWhen the deodar is subjected to the process by which tar is extracted\r\nfrom other pines, it yields a much thinner liquid than tar--of a dark\r\nred colour, and very pungent smell.  This liquid is known as \"cedar\r\noil;\" and is used by the hill people as a remedy for skin diseases--as\r\nalso for all scrofulous complaints in cattle.\r\n\r\nThe deodar is of very slow growth; and this unfits it for being\r\nintroduced into European countries--except as an ornamental timber for\r\nparks and pleasure grounds.\r\n\r\nIt was chiefly on account of its property of being easily split into\r\nplanks, or pieces of light scantling, that the deodar was selected for\r\nmaking the sides of the ladders.  To have cut down the trunks of heavy\r\ntrees to the proper thickness for light ladders--with such imperfect\r\nimplements as they were possessed of--would have been an interminable\r\nwork for our inexperienced carpenters.  The little axe of Ossaroo and\r\nthe knives were the only tools they possessed available for the work.\r\nAs the deodar could be split with wedges, it was just the timber wanted\r\nunder these circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in \"prospecting\" among the deodar trees, a pine of another\r\nspecies came under the observation of our adventurers.  It was that\r\nknown as the \"cheel.\"\r\n\r\nIt might have been seen by them without attracting any particular\r\nnotice, but for Karl; who, upon examining its leaves, and submitting\r\nthem to a botanical test, discovered that within the body of the \"cheel\"\r\nthere existed qualities that, in the circumstances in which they were\r\nplaced, would be of great value to them.  Karl knew that the \"cheel\" was\r\none of those pines, the wood of which, being full of turpentine, make\r\nmost excellent torches; and he had read, that for this very purpose it\r\nis used by all classes of people who dwell among the Himalaya mountains,\r\nand who find in these torches a very capital substitute for candles or\r\nlamps.  Karl could also have told his companions, that the turpentine\r\nitself--which oozes out of the living tree--is used by the people as an\r\nointment for sores--and that for chapped hands it is a speedy and\r\neffectual cure.  The \"cheel\" pine is nearly always found side by side\r\nwith the deodar--especially where the latter forms the chief growth of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nKarl could also have informed them that the deodar and the cheel are\r\nnot, the only pines indigenous to the Himalayas.  He could have\r\nmentioned several other species, as the \"morenda,\" a large and handsome\r\ntree, with very dark foliage, and one of the tallest of the\r\n_coniferae_--often rising to the stupendous height of two hundred feet;\r\nthe \"rye\" pine, of almost equal height with the morenda, and perhaps\r\neven more ornamental; and the \"Kolin,\" or common pine, which forms\r\nextensive forests, upon the ridges that rise from six to nine thousand\r\nfeet above sea-level.  The last thrives best in a dry, rocky soil and it\r\nis surprising in what places it will take root and grow.  In the\r\nperpendicular face of a smooth granite rock, large trees of this species\r\nmay be seen.  In the rock there exists a little crevice.  Into this a\r\nseed in some manner finds its way, vegetates, and in time becomes a\r\ngreat tree--flourishing perhaps for centuries, where, to all appearance,\r\nthere is not a particle of soil to nourish it, and probably deriving\r\nsustenance from the rock itself!\r\n\r\nIt was with no slight gratification that Karl beheld the \"cheel\" growing\r\nso near.  He knew that from it they would obtain brilliant torches--as\r\nmany as they might stand in need of; so that during the dark nights,\r\ninstead of sitting idle for the want of light, they could occupy\r\nthemselves till a late hour within the hovel, in making the \"rounds\" of\r\nthe ladders, and doing such other little \"chores\" as the occasion might\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SCALING LADDERS.\r\n\r\nThe cutting down of the trees did not occupy them a very long time.\r\nThey chose only those of slender girth--the more slender the better, so\r\nlong as they answered the requirements as to length.  Trees of about\r\nfifty feet in total height were the best: as these, when the weaker part\r\nof the tops was cut off, yielded lengths of thirty or more feet.  Where\r\nthey were only a few inches in diameter, there was very little trouble\r\nin reducing them to the proper size for the sides of the ladders--only\r\nto strip off the bark and split them in twain.\r\n\r\nMaking the rounds was also an easy operation--except that it required\r\nconsiderable time, as there were so many of them.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of the work--and this they had foreseen--would\r\nbe the drilling of the holes to receive the rounds; and it was the task\r\nwhich proved the most dilatory--taking up more time in its\r\naccomplishment than both the cutting of the timber, and reducing it to\r\nits proper shapes and dimensions.\r\n\r\nHad they owned an auger or a mortising chisel, or even a good gimlet,\r\nthe thing would have been easy enough.  Easier still had they possessed\r\na \"breast bit.\"  But of course not any of these tools could be obtained;\r\nnor any other by which a hole might be bored big enough to have admitted\r\nthe points of their little fingers.  Hundreds of holes would be needed;\r\nand how were they to be made?  With the blades of their small knives it\r\nwould have been possible to scoop out a cavity--that is, with much\r\ntrouble and waste of time; but vast time and trouble would it take to\r\nscoop out four hundred; and at least that number would be needed.  It\r\nwould be a tedious task and almost interminable, even supposing that it\r\ncould be accomplished; but this was doubtful enough.  The blades of the\r\nknives might be worn or broken, long before the necessary number of\r\nholes could be made.\r\n\r\nOf course, had they been possessed of a sufficient number of nails, they\r\nmight have done without holes.  The steps of the ladders could have been\r\nnailed upon the sides, instead of being mortised into them.  But nails\r\nwere a commodity quite as scarce with them as tools.  With the exception\r\nof those in the soles of their shoes, or the stocks of their guns, there\r\nwas not a nail in the valley.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be denied that they were in a dilemma.  But Karl had\r\nforeseen this difficulty, and provided against it before a stick of\r\ntimber had been cut.  Indeed, close following on the first conception of\r\nthe scaling ladders, this matter had passed through his mind, and had\r\nbeen settled to his satisfaction.  Only theoretically, it is true; but\r\nhis theory was afterwards reduced to practice; and, unlike many other\r\ntheories, the practice proved in correspondence with it.\r\n\r\nKarl's theory was to make the holes by fire--in other words, to bore\r\nthem with a red-hot iron.\r\n\r\nWhere was this iron to be obtained?  That appeared to offer a\r\ndifficulty, as great as the absence of an auger or a mortise-chisel.\r\nBut by Karl's ingenuity it was also got over.  He chanced to have a\r\nsmall pocket pistol: it was single-barrelled, the barrel being about six\r\ninches in length, without any thimbles, beading, or ramrod attached to\r\nit.  What Karl intended to do, then, was to heat this barrel red-hot,\r\nand make a boring-iron of it.  And this was exactly what he _did_ do;\r\nand after heating it some hundreds of times, and applying it as often to\r\nthe sides of the different ladders, he at last succeeded in burning out\r\nas many holes as there were rounds to go into them, multiplied exactly\r\nby two.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that this wonderful boring operation was not\r\naccomplished at a single \"spell,\" nor yet in a single day.  On the\r\ncontrary, it took Karl many an hour and many a day, and cost him many a\r\nwet skin--by perspiration, I mean--before he had completed the boring of\r\nthose four hundred holes.  Numerous were the tears drawn from the eyes\r\nof the plant-hunter--not by grief, but by the smoke of the seething\r\ncedar wood.\r\n\r\nWhen Karl had finished the peculiar task he had thus assigned to\r\nhimself, but little more remained to be done--only to set each pair of\r\nsides together, stick in the rounds, bind fast at each end, and there\r\nwas a ladder finished and ready to be scaled.\r\n\r\nOne by one they were thus turned off; and one by one earned to the foot\r\nof the cliff, up which the ascent was to be _attempted_.\r\n\r\nSad are we to say that it was still only an attempt; and sadder yet that\r\nthat attempt proved a failure.\r\n\r\nOne by one were the ladders raised to their respective ledges--until\r\nthree-fourths of the cliff had been successfully scaled.  Here, alas!\r\nwas their climbing brought to a conclusion, by a circumstance up to this\r\ntime unforeseen.  On reaching one of the ledges--the fourth from the top\r\nof the cliff--they found, to their chagrin, that the rock above it,\r\ninstead of receding a little, as with all the others, _hung over_--\r\nprojecting several inches beyond the outer line of the ledge.  Against\r\nthat rock no ladder could have been set; none would have rested there--\r\nsince it could not be placed even perpendicularly.  There was no attempt\r\nmade to take one up.  Though the projection could not be discerned from\r\nbelow, Karl, standing on the topmost round of the last ladder that had\r\nbeen planted, saw at once, with the eye of an engineer, that the\r\ndifficulty was insurmountable.  It would be as easy for them to fly, is\r\nto stand a ladder upon that ill-starred ledge; and with this conviction\r\nfully impressed upon his mind, the young plant-hunter returned slowly\r\nand sorrowfully to the ground to communicate the disagreeable\r\nintelligence to his companions.\r\n\r\nIt was no use for either Caspar or Ossaroo to go up again.  They had\r\nbeen on the ledge already; and had arrived at the same conviction.\r\nKarl's report was final and conclusive.\r\n\r\nAll their ingenuity defeated--all their toil gone for nothing--their\r\ntime wasted--their hopes blighted--the bright sky of their future once\r\nmore obscured with darkest clouds--all through that unforeseen\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nJust as when they returned out of the cavern--after that patient but\r\nfruitless search--just as then, sate they down upon the rocks--each\r\nstaggering to that which was nearest him--sad, dispirited, forlorn.\r\n\r\nThere sate they, with eyes now fixed upon the ground, now turning\r\ntowards the cliff and gazing mechanically upon that serried line, like\r\nthe stairway of some gigantic spider--those long ladders, planted with\r\nso much pains, climbed only once, and never to be climbed again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nAN EMPTY LARDER.\r\n\r\nLong sat they in this attitude, all three, observing a profound silence.\r\nThe air was keenly cold, for it was now mid-winter, but none of them\r\nseemed to feel the cold.  The deep disappointment, the bitter chagrin\r\nthat filled their minds, hindered them from perceiving bodily pain; and\r\nat that moment had an avalanche threatened to slide down upon them from\r\nthe snowy summit above, not one of the three would have much cared to\r\nescape out of its way.\r\n\r\nSo tired had they become of their aerial prison--so terrified by the\r\nprospect of its continuing for ever--or at least as long as they might\r\nlive--they could have contemplated even death without additional terror.\r\n\r\nThe straw, to which they had so long and so fondly clung, was snatched\r\nfrom their grasp.  Again were they drowning.\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour sat they thus, moody and desponding.  The\r\npurple-coloured tints, that began to play over the surface of the\r\neternal snows above, admonished them that the sun was far down in the\r\nheavens, and that night was approaching.\r\n\r\nKarl was the first to become conscious of this--the first to break\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, brothers!\" said he, under the impress of their common misfortune\r\nincluding Ossaroo in the fraternal appellation.  \"Come away!  It is\r\nuseless to stay longer here.  Let us go home!\"\r\n\r\n\"Home!\" repeated Caspar, with a melancholy smile.  \"Ah!  Karl, I wish\r\nyou had not spoken the word.  So sweet at other times, it now rings in\r\nmy ears like some unearthly echo.  Home, indeed!  Alas, dear brother! we\r\nshall ne'er go home.\"\r\n\r\nTo this pathetic speech Karl made no reply.  He could offer no word of\r\nhope or consolation; and therefore remained silent.  He had already\r\nrisen to his feet--the others following his example--and all three\r\nwalked moodily away from the spot, taking the most direct route towards\r\ntheir rude dwelling, which now more than ever they had reason to regard\r\nas their _home_.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the hut they found still another cause of inquietude.  Their\r\nstock of provisions, which had survived the destructive onset of the\r\nelephant, had been economised with great care.  But as they had been too\r\nbusy in making the ladders to waste time on any other species of\r\nindustry, nothing had been added to the larder--neither fish, flesh, nor\r\nfowl.  On the contrary, it had dwindled down, until upon that clay when\r\nthey issued forth to try their ladders against the cliff, they had left\r\nbehind them only a single piece of dried yak-beef--about enough to have\r\nfurnished them with a single meal.\r\n\r\nHungry after the day's fruitless exertion, they were contemplating a\r\nsupper upon it, and not without some degree of pleasant anticipation:\r\nfor nature under all circumstances will assert her rights, and the\r\ncravings of appetite are not to be stifled even by the most anguished\r\nsuffering of the spirit.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer to the hut, but more especially when they came in\r\nsight of it, and perceived its rude but hospitable doorway open to\r\nreceive them--as from the chill atmosphere through which they were\r\npassing they beheld its sheltering roof of thatch, and thought of its\r\nsnug, cosy interior--as, keenly experiencing the pangs both of cold and\r\nhunger, they beheld in fancy a bright faggot fire crackling upon the\r\nhearth, and heard the yak-beef hissing and sputtering in the blaze,\r\ntheir spirits began to return to their natural condition, and if not\r\nactual joy, something that very much resembled cheerfulness might have\r\nbeen observed in the demeanour of all.\r\n\r\nIt is ever thus with the mind of man, and perhaps fortunate that it is\r\nso.  The human soul finds its type in the sky--cloud and sunshine,\r\nsunshine and cloud.\r\n\r\nWith our adventurers the dark cloud had for the moment passed; and a\r\ngleam of light was once more shining upon their hearts.\r\n\r\nIt was not destined to shine long.  A light had been struck, and a fire\r\nkindled that soon blazed brightly.  So far one desire had been\r\nsatisfied.  They could warm themselves.  But when they came to think of\r\ngratifying an appetite of a far more craving character--when they\r\nessayed to search for that piece of yak flesh that was to furnish forth\r\ntheir supper--they found it not!\r\n\r\nDuring their absence, the burglar had also been abroad.  Their larder\r\nhad been assailed.  The _hung_ beef was hanging there no longer.\r\n\r\nSome wild animal--wolf, panther, or other predatory creature--had\r\nentered by the open doorway,--left open in the excitement of that\r\nhopeful departure--found open upon their return--but, like the door of\r\nthat oft-quoted stable, not worth shutting, since the steed had been\r\nstolen.\r\n\r\nNot a morsel, not a mouthful remained--either of yak-beef or food of any\r\nother kind--and all three, Fritz making the fourth, had to go supperless\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nGOING ABROAD FOR BREAKFAST.\r\n\r\nThe exertions which they had made in carrying and erecting the ladders\r\nhad so wearied them, that, despite their empty stomachs, all three were\r\nable to sleep.  Their slumber, however, was neither profound nor\r\nprolonged; and one and another of them awoke at intervals during the\r\nnight and lay awake, reflecting upon the miserable fate that had\r\nbefallen them, and the poor prospects now before them.\r\n\r\nThey were even without the ordinary consolation of knowing that they\r\nmight find something to eat in the morning.  Before they could have any\r\nbreakfast, they knew they would first have to find it in the forest.\r\nThey would have to search, find, and kill, before they could eat.\r\n\r\nBut they had reason now not only to be in doubt about procuring their\r\nbreakfast, but their dinner and supper--in short, their whole future\r\nsubsistence.  Circumstances had become changed.  The larder, hitherto\r\namply provided by Caspar's hunting skill, was now quite empty; and\r\nalthough he could soon have replenished it had their ammunition not been\r\ndestroyed, it was now quite a different thing.  Caspar's power was gone\r\nalong with his powder; and the deer and other quadrupeds, which were\r\nknown to be yet numerous in the valley--to say nothing of the winged\r\ncreatures that frequented it, could now smile at any attempt on the part\r\nof Caspar to trouble them any longer with his double-barrelled\r\ndetonator.  The gun would hereafter be as useless as a bar of iron.\r\n\r\nOnly one charge of powder for each barrel remained, and one more for\r\nKarl's rifle.  When these three should be fired off, not another shot\r\nmight ever again be heard ringing through that silent valley, and waking\r\nthe echoes of the surrounding cliffs.\r\n\r\nBut it had not yet entered their minds that they might be unable to kill\r\nany of the wild animals with which the place abounded.  Had they thought\r\nso, they would have been unhappy indeed--perhaps so anxious as not to\r\nhave slept another wink for that night.  But they did not yet\r\ncontemplate the future so despondingly.  They hoped that, even without\r\ntheir guns, they would still be enabled to procure sufficient game for\r\ntheir support; and as they all lay awake, just before the breaking of\r\nthe day, this became the subject of their conversation.\r\n\r\nOssaroo still felt full confidence in his bow and arrows; and should\r\nthese fail, there was his fishing-net; and if that also were to draw\r\nblank, the experienced shikaree knew a score of other schemes for\r\ncircumventing the beasts of the earth, the birds of the air, and the\r\nfinny denizens of the water.  Karl expressed his determination, as soon\r\nas spring should return, to commence cultivating certain edible roots\r\nand plants, which grew rather sparsely around, but, by the careful\r\npropagation of which, a crop might be procured of sufficient abundance.\r\nMoreover, they resolved that in the following year they should store up\r\nsuch wild fruits and berries as were fit for food; and thus insure\r\nthemselves against any chance of famine for months to come.  The failure\r\nof their late attempt with the ladders had reproduced within them the\r\nfirm though fearful conviction, that for the rest of their lives they\r\nwere destined to dwell within the mountain valley--never more to go\r\nbeyond the bounds of that stupendous prison-like wall that encircled\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWith this impression now freshly stamped upon their minds, they returned\r\nto speculate on the means of present existence, as also on that of their\r\nmore immediate future; and in this way did they pass the last hour of\r\nthe night--that which was succeeded by the daybreak.\r\n\r\nAs the first streaks of dawning day appeared upon the snowy summits--\r\nseveral of which were visible from the door of the hut--all three might\r\nhave been seen outside preparing themselves for the execution of some\r\nimportant design.  Their purpose might easily be told from the character\r\nof their preparations.  Caspar was charging his double-barrelled gun;\r\nand carefully too--for it was the \"last shot in his locker.\"\r\n\r\nKarl was similarly employed with his rifle, while Ossaroo was arming\r\nhimself in his peculiar fashion, looking to the string of his bow, and\r\nfilling the little wicker bag, that constituted his quiver, with\r\nsharp-pointed arrows.\r\n\r\nFrom this it was evident that the chase was the occupation immediately\r\nintended, and that all three were about to engage in it.  In truth, they\r\nwere going out in search of something for their breakfast; and if a keen\r\nappetite could ensure success, they could scarce fail in procuring it:\r\nfor they were all three as hungry as wolves.\r\n\r\nFritz, too, was as hungry as any of them; and looked as if he meant to\r\ndo his best in helping them to procure the material for a meal.  Any\r\ncreature, beast or bird, that should be so unfortunate as to come within\r\nclutching distance of his gaunt jaws, would have but little chance on\r\nthat particular morning of escaping from them.\r\n\r\nIt had been resolved upon that they should go in different directions:\r\nas by that means there would be three chances of finding game instead of\r\none; and as something was wanted for breakfast, the sooner it could be\r\nprocured the better.  If Ossaroo should succeed in killing anything with\r\nhis arrows, he was to give a shrill whistle to call the others back to\r\nthe hut; while if either of them should fire, of course the shot would\r\nbe heard, and that would be the signal for all to return.\r\n\r\nWith this understanding, and after some little badinage about who would\r\nbe the successful caterer, they all set forth, Caspar going to the\r\nright, Ossaroo to the left, and Karl, followed by Fritz, taking the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nCASPAR ON A STALK.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the three hunters had lost sight of one another, Karl\r\nand Caspar proceeding round the lake by opposite sides, but both keeping\r\nunder cover of the bushes; while Ossaroo wended his way along the bottom\r\nof the cliff--thinking he might have a better chance in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe game which Caspar expected first might fall in his way was the\r\n\"kakur,\" or barking-deer.  These little animals appeared to be more\r\nnumerous in the valley than any other creatures.  Caspar had scarcely\r\never been abroad upon a shooting excursion without seeing one; and on\r\nseveral occasions a kakur had constituted his whole \"bag.\"  He had\r\nlearnt an ingenious way of bringing them within range of his gun--simply\r\nby placing himself in ambush and imitating their call; which, as may be\r\ndeduced from one of their common names, is a sort of bark.  It is a\r\nsound very much resembling the bark of a fox, only that it is much\r\nlouder.  This the kakur sends forth, whenever it suspects the presence\r\nof an enemy in its neighbourhood; and keeps repeating it at short\r\nintervals, until it believes either that the danger has been withdrawn,\r\nor withdraws itself from the danger.\r\n\r\nThe simple little ruminant does not seem to be aware that this sound--\r\nperhaps intended as a note of warning to its companions--too often\r\nbecomes its own death-signal, by betraying its whereabouts to the\r\nsportsman or other deadly enemy.  Not only the hunter, man, but the\r\ntiger, the leopard, the cheetah, and other predatory creatures, take\r\nadvantage of this foolish habit of the barking-deer; and stealing upon\r\nit unawares, make it their victim.\r\n\r\nThe bark is very easily imitated by the human voice; and after a single\r\nlesson, with Ossaroo as instructor, not only could Caspar do the decoy\r\nto a nicety, but even Karl, who only overheard the shikaree instructing\r\nhis pupil, was able to produce a sound precisely similar.\r\n\r\nPresent hunger prompted Caspar to go in search of the kakur, as that\r\nwould be the game most likely to turn up first.  There were other\r\nquadrupeds, and some birds too, whose flesh would have served better, as\r\nbeing of superior delicacy: for the venison of the barking-deer is none\r\nof the sweetest.  In the autumn it is not bad--nor up to a late period\r\nin the winter--though it is never very delicious at any season.\r\n\r\nOn that morning, however, Caspar was not at all fastidious; and he knew\r\nthat neither were the others--hunger having robbed them of all delicacy\r\nof appetite.  Even kakur venison would be palatable enough, could he\r\nprocure it; and for this purpose was he going in a particular direction,\r\nand not wandering hither and thither, as sportsmen usually do when in\r\nsearch of game.\r\n\r\nHe knew of a spot where kakur were almost sure of being found.  It was a\r\npretty glade, surrounded by thick evergreen shrubbery--not far from the\r\nedge of the lake, and on the side opposite to that where the hut was\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nCaspar had never entered this glade--and he had gone through it several\r\ntimes--without seeing kakur browsing upon the grassy turf, or lying in\r\nthe shade of the bushes that grew around its edge.  It was but fair to\r\npresume, therefore, that on that morning, as upon others, the glade\r\nwould furnish him with this species of game.\r\n\r\nWithout making stop anywhere else, he walked on till he had got within a\r\nfew rods of the spot where he expected to procure the materials of the\r\nbreakfast; and then, entering among the underwood, he advanced more\r\nslowly and with greater caution.  To ensure success, he even dropped\r\nupon his knees, and crawled cat-like, using his arms as forelegs and his\r\nhands as paws!  After this fashion he worked his way forward to the edge\r\nof the opening--all the while keeping a thick leafy bush before his body\r\nto screen himself from the eyes of any creature--kakur or other animal--\r\nthat might be within the glade.\r\n\r\nOn getting close up behind the bush, he came to a halt; and then,\r\ncautiously raising his shoulders, he peeped through between the leafy\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nIt took him some seconds of time to survey the whole surface of the\r\nglade; but when he had finished his scrutiny, a shadow of disappointment\r\nmight have been seen passing over his countenance.  There was no game\r\nthere--neither kakur nor animals of any other kind.\r\n\r\nNot without a certain feeling of chagrin did the young hunter perceive\r\nthat the opening was empty: for, to say nothing of the annoyance he felt\r\non not being able to procure a joint of venison for breakfast, he had\r\nbeen flattering himself that, from his superior knowledge of the ground,\r\nhe would be the first to find the material for their matutinal meal--\r\nabout which he had some little feeling of hunter-pride and rivalry.\r\n\r\nHe did not permit this preliminary disappointment to rob him of all\r\nhope.  If there were no kakur within the glade, there might be some in\r\nthe bushes near its edge; and perhaps, by adopting the decoy he had\r\nseveral times already practised--that of imitating their call--he might\r\nentice one out into the open ground.\r\n\r\nActing upon this idea, he squatted close behind the bush, and commenced\r\nbarking, as near as he could, _a la kakur_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nTHE DOUBLE DECOY.\r\n\r\nIt was some considerable time before he heard any response to cheer him,\r\nor observed any sign that indicated the presence or proximity of an\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nHe repeated his bark many times, with intervals of silence between--and\r\nwas about yielding to the conviction, that not only the open ground, but\r\nthe bushes around it, were going to draw blank.\r\n\r\nHe had uttered his last bark, with all the alluring intonation that he\r\ncould throw into the sound; and was about starting to his feet to\r\nproceed elsewhere, when just then the real cry of the kakur responded to\r\nhis feigned one--apparently coming from out the thicket on the opposite\r\nside of the glade.\r\n\r\nThe sound was heard only faintly, as if the animal was at a great\r\ndistance off; but Caspar knew that if it was a response to his call--\r\nwhich he believed it to be--it would soon draw nearer.  He lost no time,\r\ntherefore, in giving utterance to a fresh series of barks of the most\r\nseductive character; and then once more strained his ears to listen for\r\nthe reply.\r\n\r\nAgain the barks of the kakur came back upon the breeze--repeated\r\nserially, and so resembling his own, that had Caspar not known that they\r\nproceeded from the throat of a deer, he might have fancied them to be\r\nechoes.  He did not allow many seconds to elapse before barking again,\r\nand again, with an equal straining at allurement.\r\n\r\nThis time, to the surprise of the young hunter, there was no response.\r\nHe listened, but not a sound came back--not even an echo.\r\n\r\nHe barked again, and again listened.  As before, silence profound,\r\nunbroken.\r\n\r\nNo--it was not unbroken.  Although it was not the call of the kakur,\r\nanother sound interrupted the stillness--a sound equally welcome to the\r\near of the young hunter.  It was a rustling among the leaves on the\r\nopposite side of the glade; just such as might indicate the passage of\r\nan animal through the bushes.\r\n\r\nDirecting his eye towards the spot where the sound appeared to proceed,\r\nCaspar saw, or fancied he saw, some twigs in motion.  But it was no\r\nfancy: for the moment after he not only saw the twigs move, but behind\r\nthe bush to which they belonged he could just make out a\r\ndarkish-coloured object.  It could be nothing else than the body of the\r\nkakur.  Although it was very near--for the glade was scarce twenty yards\r\nacross, and the deer was directly behind the line of low shrubs which\r\nformed a sort of selvedge around it--Caspar could not get a good view of\r\nthe animal.  It was well screened by the foliage, and better perhaps by\r\nthe absence of a bright light: for it was yet only the grey twilight of\r\nmorning.  There was light enough, however, to take aim; and as the\r\nintervening branches were only tiny twigs, Caspar had no fear that they\r\nwould interfere with the direction of his ballet.  There was no reason,\r\ntherefore, why he should delay longer.  He might not get a better\r\nchance; and if he waited longer, or barked again, the kakur might\r\ndiscover the decoy, and run back into the bushes.\r\n\r\n\"Here goes, then!\" muttered Caspar to himself; at the same time placing\r\nhimself firmly on one knee, raising his gun and cocking it.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid lock--that upon the right-hand barrel of Caspar's\r\ngun--one in which the cock, on being drawn to the full, gives tongue to\r\ntell that the spring is in perfect order.\r\n\r\nIn the profound stillness of the morning-air the \"click\" sounded clear\r\nenough to have been heard across the glade, and much further.  Caspar\r\neven feared that it might be loud enough to affright the deer; and kept\r\nhis eye fixed upon the latter as he drew back the cock.  The animal\r\nstirred not; but instead--almost simultaneous with the click of his gun,\r\nand as if it had been its echo--another click fell upon the hunter's\r\near, apparently coming from the spot on which the kakur was standing!\r\n\r\nFortunate was it for Caspar that his own spring had clicked so clear--\r\nand fortunate also he had heard that apparent echo--else he might either\r\nhave shot his brother, or his brother him, or each might have shot the\r\nother!\r\n\r\nAs it was, the second click caused Caspar to start to his feet.  Karl at\r\nthe same instant was seen hurriedly rising erect upon the opposite side\r\nof the glade, while both with cocked guns in their hands stood eyeing\r\neach other, like two individuals about to engage in a deadly duel of\r\nrifles!\r\n\r\nHad any one seen them at that moment, and in that attitude, their wild\r\nlooks would have given colour to the supposition that such was in\r\nreality their intent; and some time would have elapsed before any action\r\non the part of either would have contradicted this fearful belief: for\r\nit was several seconds before either could find speech to express their\r\nmutual surprise.\r\n\r\nIt was something more than surprise--it was awe--a deep tragical emotion\r\nof indefinable terror, gradually giving way to a feeling of heartfelt\r\nthankfulness, at the fortunate chance that had made them aware of each\r\nother's presence, and saved them from a mutual fratricide.\r\n\r\nFor some seconds I have said not a word was spoken; and then only short\r\nexclamations of similar import came trembling from the lips of both.\r\nBoth, as if acting under a common impulse, flung their guns to the\r\nground.  Then, rushing across the glade, they threw their arms around\r\neach other; and remained for some moments locked in a brotherly embrace.\r\n\r\nNo explanation was needed by either.  Karl, after passing round the lake\r\nby the other side, had strayed by chance in the direction of the glade.\r\nOn nearing it, he had heard the barking of a kakur--not dreaming that it\r\nwas Caspar acting as a decoy.  He had answered the signal; and finding\r\nthat the kakur still kept its place, he had advanced toward the opening\r\nwith the intention of stalking it.  On getting nearer he had ceased to\r\nutter the call, under the belief that he should find the deer out in the\r\nopen ground.  Just as he arrived by its edge, Caspar was mimicking the\r\nkakur in such an admirable manner, and so energetically, that Karl could\r\nneither fail to be deceived as to the character of the animal, nor\r\nremain ignorant of its position.  The darkish disc visible behind the\r\nevergreen leaves could be no other than the body of the deer; and Karl\r\nwas just about cocking his rifle, to bore it with a bullet, when the\r\nclick of Caspar's double-barrel sounding ominously in his ear,\r\nfortunately conducted to a far different _denouement_ than that fatal\r\n_finale_ which was so near having occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nThe signal of the Shikaree.\r\n\r\nAs if sent to cheer and distract their minds from the feeling of dread\r\nawe which still held possession of them, just then the shrill whistle of\r\nOssaroo came pealing across the lake, reverberating in echoes from the\r\ncliff toward which he had gone.  Shortly after the signal sounded again\r\nin a slightly different direction--showing that the shikaree had\r\nsucceeded in bagging his game, and was returning towards the hut.\r\n\r\nOn hearing the signal, Karl and Caspar regarded each other with glances\r\nof peculiar significance.\r\n\r\n\"So, brother,\" said Caspar, smiling oddly as he spoke, \"you see Ossaroo\r\nwith his despised bow and arrows has beaten us both.  What, if either of\r\nus had beaten him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or,\" replied Karl, \"what if we had both beaten him?  Ah! brother\r\nCaspar,\" added he, shuddering as he spoke, \"how near we were to making\r\nan end of each other!  It's fearful to think of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us think no more of it then,\" rejoined Caspar; \"but go home at once\r\nand see what sort of a breakfast Ossy has procured for us.  I wonder\r\nwhether it be flesh or fowl.\"\r\n\r\n\"One or the other, no doubt,\" he continued, after a short pause.  \"Fowl,\r\nI fancy: for as I came round the lake I heard some oddish screaming in\r\nthe direction of the cliff yonder, which was that taken by Ossaroo.  It\r\nappeared to proceed from the throat of some bird; yet such I think I\r\nhave never heard before.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have,\" replied Karl; \"I heard it also.  I fancy I know the bird\r\nthat made those wild notes: and if it be one of them the shikaree has\r\nshot, we shall have a breakfast fit for a prince, and of a kind Lucullus\r\ndelighted to indulge in.  But let us obey the signal of our shikaree,\r\nand see whether we're in such good luck.\"\r\n\r\nThey had already regained possession of their guns.  Shouldering them,\r\nthey started forth from the glade--so near being the scene of a tragical\r\nevent--and, turning the end of the lake, walked briskly back in the\r\ndirection of the hut.\r\n\r\nOn coming within view of it, they descried the shikaree sitting upon a\r\nstone, just by the doorway; and lying across his knee, a most beautiful\r\nbird--by far the most beautiful that either flies in the air, swims in\r\nthe water, or walks upon the earth--the peacock.  Not the half\r\nturkey-shaped creature that struts around the farmyard--though _he_ is\r\neven more beautiful than any other bird--but the wild peacock of the\r\nInd--of shape slender and elegant--of plumage resplendent as the most\r\npriceless of gems--and, what was then of more consequence to our\r\nadventurers, of flesh delicate and savoury as the choicest of game.\r\nThis last was evidently the quality of the peacock most admired by\r\nOssaroo.  The elegant shape he had already destroyed; the resplendent\r\nplumes he was plucking out and casting to the winds, as though they had\r\nbeen common feathers; and his whole action betokened that he had no more\r\nregard for those grand tail feathers and that gorgeous purple corselet,\r\nthan if it had been a goose, or an old turkey-cock that lay stretched\r\nacross his knee.\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word, when the others came up, there was that in\r\nOssaroo's look--as he glanced furtively towards the young sahibs, and\r\nsaw that both were empty-handed--that betrayed a certain degree of\r\npride--just enough to show that he was enjoying a triumph.  To know that\r\nhe was the only one who had made a _coup_, it was not necessary for him\r\nto look up.  Had either succeeded in killing game, or even in finding\r\nit, he must have heard the report of a gun, and none such on that\r\nmorning had awakened the echoes of the valley.  Ossaroo, therefore, knew\r\nthat a brace of empty game-bags were all that were brought back.\r\n\r\nUnlike the young sahibs, he had no particular adventure to relate.  His\r\n\"stalk\" had been a very quiet one--ending, as most quiet stalks do, in\r\nthe death of the animal stalked.  He had heard the old peacock\r\nscreeching on the top of a tall tree; he had stolen up within bow range,\r\nsent an arrow through his glittering gorget, and brought him tumbling to\r\nthe ground.  He had then laid his vulgar hands upon the beautiful bird,\r\ngrasping it by the legs, and carrying it with draggling wings--just as\r\nif it had been a common dunghill fowl he was taking to the market of\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\nKarl and Caspar did not choose to waste time in telling the shikaree how\r\nnear they had been to leaving him the sole and undisputed possessor of\r\nthat detached dwelling and the grounds belonging to it.  Hunger prompted\r\nthem to defer the relation to a future time; and also to lend a hand in\r\nthe culinary operations already initiated by Ossaroo.  By their aid,\r\ntherefore, a fire was set ablaze; and the peacock, not very cleanly\r\nplucked, was soon roasting in the flames--Fritz having already made\r\nshort work with the giblets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE IBEX.\r\n\r\nBig as was the body of the peacock, there was not much of it left after\r\nthat _dejeuner aux doigts_!  Only the bones; and so clean picked were\r\nthey, that had Fritz not already been made welcome to the giblets, he\r\nwould have had but a scanty meal of it.\r\n\r\nThe savoury roast did a good deal towards restoring the spirits of the\r\nparty; but they could not help dwelling upon the indifferent prospect\r\nthey now had of procuring a fresh stock of provisions--so much changed\r\nwere circumstances by their powder having been destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe bow and arrows of Ossaroo were still left, and other bows could be\r\nmade, if that one was to get broken.  Indeed, Caspar now determined on\r\nhaving one of his own; and practising archery under the tutelage of the\r\nshikaree, until he should be able to use that old-fashioned and\r\nuniversal weapon with deadly effect.\r\n\r\nOld-fashioned we may well term it: since its existence dates far beyond\r\nthe earliest times of historical record; and universal: for go where you\r\nwill into the most remote corners of the earth, the bow is found in the\r\nhands of the savage, copied from no model, introduced from no external\r\nsource, but evidently native to the country and the tribe, as if when\r\nman was first created the weapon had been put into his hands by the\r\nCreator himself!\r\n\r\nIndeed, the occurrence of the bow--with its necessary adjunct, the\r\narrow--among tribes of savages living widely apart, and who, to all\r\nappearance, could never have communicated the idea to one another--is\r\none of the most curious circumstances in the history of mankind; and\r\nthere is no other way of explaining it, than by the supposition that the\r\npropelling power which exists in the recoil of a tightly-stretched\r\nstring must be one of the earliest phenomena that presents itself to the\r\nhuman mind; and that, therefore, in many parts of the world this idea\r\nhas been an indigenous and original conception.\r\n\r\nThe bow and arrow is certainly one of the oldest weapons on the earth--\r\nas well as one of the most universally distributed.  It is a subject\r\nthat, in the hands of the skilled ethnologist, might become one of the\r\nmost interesting chapters in the history of the human race.\r\n\r\nI have said that after eating the peacock our adventurers were in better\r\nspirits; but for all that, they could not help feeling some little\r\napprehension as to how their food was to be obtained for the future.\r\nOssaroo's skill had provided their breakfast; but how about their\r\ndinner?  And after that their supper?  Even should something turn up for\r\nthe next meal, they might not be so fortunate in obtaining the next\r\nafter that; and this precarious way of subsistence--living, as it were,\r\nfrom hand to mouth--would be a constant exposure of their lives to the\r\nchances of starvation.\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as they had finished with the flesh of the peacock--\r\nand while Ossaroo, who continued eating longer than any of them, was\r\nstill engaged in polishing off the \"drumsticks\"--the point of\r\nreplenishing the larder became the subject of their conversation; and\r\nall agreed that to get up a stock of provisions had now become a matter\r\nof primary importance.  They resolved, therefore, to devote themselves\r\nentirely to this business--using such means as were in their power for\r\ncapturing game, and devising other means should these prove\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, then, what were they to have for dinner?  Was it to\r\nbe fish, flesh, or fowl?  They did not think of having all three: for in\r\ntheir situation they had no desire for a fashionable dinner.  One course\r\nwould be sufficient for them; and they would only be too thankful to\r\nhave one course assured to them.\r\n\r\nWhether they would choose to go fishing with Ossaroo's net, and have\r\nfish for their dinner, or whether they would try for another peacock, or\r\nan argus pheasant, or a brace of Brahminy geese; or whether they would\r\ntake to the woods and search for grander game, had not become a decided\r\npoint; when an incident occurred that settled the question, as to what\r\nthey were to have for dinner.  Without any exertion on their part--\r\nwithout the wasting of a single shot, or the spending of an arrow, they\r\nwere provided with meat; and in quantity sufficient, not only for that\r\nday's dinner, but to ration them for a whole week, with odds and ends\r\nfalling to the share of Fritz.\r\n\r\nThey had gone out of the hut again; and were seated, as oft before, on\r\nsome large stones that lay upon the ground in front.  It was a fine\r\nbright morning; and, although cold in the shade, the sun shining down\r\nupon them, reflected from the white snow on the mountains above, made it\r\nwarm enough to be pleasant.  For that reason, and because there was some\r\nsmoke inside the hut, where they had cooked their breakfast, they had\r\npreferred eating it in the open air; and here also they were holding\r\ncouncil as to their future proceedings.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged, a sound fell upon their ears that bore some\r\nresemblance to the bleating of a goat.  It appeared to come down from\r\nthe sky above them; but they knew that it must be caused by some animal\r\non the cliffs overhead.\r\n\r\nOn looking upwards, they beheld the animal; and if its voice had already\r\nappeared to them to be like that of a goat, the creature itself in its\r\n_personal_ appearance, to a very great extent, carried out the\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\nTo speak the truth, it _was_ a goat; though not one of the common kind.\r\nIt was an _ibex_.\r\n\r\nOnce more Karl had the advantage of his companions.  His knowledge of\r\nnatural history enabled him to identify the animal.  At the first glance\r\nhe pronounced it an ibex; although he had never seen a living ibex\r\nbefore.  But the goat-like shape of the animal, its shaggy coat, and\r\nabove all, the immense ringed horns curving regularly backward over its\r\nshoulders, were all characteristic points, which Karl was able to\r\nidentify by a comparison with pictures he had seen in books, and stuffed\r\nskins he had examined in a museum.\r\n\r\nOssaroo said it was a goat--some kind of a wild goat, he supposed; but\r\nas Ossaroo had never before been so high up the mountains, and therefore\r\nnever in the regions frequented by the ibex, he knew it not.  His\r\nconjecture that it was a goat was founded on the general resemblance\r\nwhich it bore to a goat; and this Caspar had observed as well as\r\nOssaroo.\r\n\r\nThey could see the creature from head to foot, standing in a majestic\r\nattitude on a prominent point of the cliff; but although it was in\r\nreality much larger than the common domestic goat, it was so distant\r\nfrom them as not to appear bigger than a kid.  It was _en profile_,\r\nhowever, to their eyes; and against the blue sky they could trace the\r\noutlines of the animal with perfect distinctness, and note the grand\r\nsweeping curvature of its horns.\r\n\r\nThe first thought of Caspar was to lay hold of his gun with the idea of\r\ntaking a shot at it; but both the others interposed to prevent this--\r\npointing out the impossibility of hitting at such a distance.  Although\r\nseemingly much nearer, the ibex was considerably more than a hundred\r\nyards from where they were seated: for the point of the precipice upon\r\nwhich it stood was quite four hundred feet above the level.\r\n\r\nCaspar, reflecting upon this, was easily dissuaded from his design; and\r\nthe next moment was wondering why he had been so near playing the fool\r\nas to throw away a shot--his penultimate one, too--at an animal placed\r\nfull fifty yards beyond the carry of his gun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nGOATS AND SHEEP.\r\n\r\nAs the ibex kept its ground, without showing any signs of retreating, or\r\neven moving a muscle of its body, they remained watching it.  Not,\r\nhowever, in silence: for as the animal was standing as if to have its\r\nportrait painted, Karl, in words addressed to his two companions, but\r\nchiefly intended for the instruction of Caspar, proceeded to execute\r\nthat very task.\r\n\r\n\"The ibex,\" said he, \"is an animal whose name has been long famous, and\r\nabout which the closet naturalists have written a great deal of\r\nnonsense--as they have about almost every other animal on the earth.\r\nAfter all that has been said about it, it is simply a goat--a wild goat,\r\nit is true, but still only a goat--having all the habits, and very much\r\nof the appearance characteristic of the domestic animal of this name.\r\n\r\n\"Every one knows that the common goat exists in as many varieties as the\r\ncountries it inhabits.  Indeed, there are more kinds of goats than\r\ncountries: for it is not uncommon to meet with three or four sorts\r\nwithin the boundaries of a single kingdom--as in Great Britain itself.\r\nThese varieties differ almost as much from each other as the `breeds' of\r\ndogs; and hence there has been much speculation among zoologists, as to\r\nwhat species of wild goat they have all originally sprung from.\r\n\r\n\"Now, it is my opinion,\" continued the plant-hunter, \"that the tame\r\ngoats found among different nations of the earth have not all descended\r\nfrom the same stock; but are the progeny of more than one wild species--\r\njust as the domesticated breeds of sheep have sprung from several\r\nspecies of wild sheep; though many zoologists deny this very plain\r\nfact.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are different species of wild goats, then?\" said Caspar,\r\ninterrogatively.\r\n\r\n\"There are,\" replied the plant-hunter, \"though they are not very\r\nnumerous--perhaps in all there may be about a dozen.  As yet there are\r\nnot so many known to zoologists--that is, not a dozen that have been\r\nidentified and described as distinct species; but no doubt when the\r\ncentral countries, both of Asia and Africa--with their grand chains of\r\nmountains--have been explored by scientific naturalists, at least that\r\nnumber will be found to exist.\r\n\r\n\"The speculating systematists--who decide about genera and species, by\r\nsome slight protuberance upon a tooth--have already created a wonderful\r\nconfusion in the family of the goats.  Not contented with viewing them\r\nall as belonging to a single genus, they have divided them into five\r\ngenera--though to most of the five they ascribe only _one species_!--\r\nthus uselessly multiplying names, and rendering the study of the subject\r\nmore complicated and difficult.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that the goats, both wild and tame--including the\r\nibex, which is a true wild goat--form of themselves a separate family in\r\nthe animal kingdom, easily distinguishable from sheep, deer, antelopes,\r\nor oxen.  The wild goats often bear a very close resemblance to certain\r\nspecies of wild sheep; and the two are not to be distinguished from each\r\nother, by the goats being covered with hair and the sheep with wool--as\r\nis generally the case with tame breeds.  On the contrary, both sheep and\r\ngoats in a wild state have _hairy_ coats--the sheep as much as the\r\ngoats; and in many instances the hair of both is quite as short as that\r\nof antelopes or deer.  Even where there are almost no external marks to\r\ndistinguish wild goats from certain kinds of wild sheep, there are found\r\n_moral_ characteristics which serve as guides to the genus.  The goat is\r\nbolder, and of a fiercer nature; and its other habits, even in the wild\r\nstate, differ essentially from those of the wild sheep.\r\n\r\n\"The ibex which we see above us,\" continued Karl, looking up to the\r\nquadruped upon the cliff, \"is neither more nor less than a wild goat.\r\nIt is not the only species of wild goat inhabiting the Himalayas; for\r\nthere is the `tahir,' a stronger and larger animal than it; and it is\r\nbelieved that when these great mountains have been thoroughly\r\n_ransacked_ [Karl here smiled at the very unscientific word he had made\r\nuse of], there will turn up one or two additional species.\r\n\r\n\"It is not the only species of ibex neither,\" continued he, \"for there\r\nis one found in the European Alps, known by the name of `steinboc;'\r\nanother, in the Pyrenees, called the `tur;' a third, in the Caucasus,\r\nthe `zac;' and one or two others in the mountains of Africa.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the animal now before, or rather above us,\" continued\r\nKarl, \"it differs very little from others of the same family; and as\r\nboth its appearance and habits have been very ably described by a noted\r\nsportsman, who was also an accomplished naturalist, I cannot do better\r\nthan quote his description: since it gives almost every detail that is\r\nyet authentically known of the Himalayan ibex.\r\n\r\n\"`The male,' writes this gentleman author, `is about the size of the\r\n_tahir_ [here he speaks of the other well-known species of Himalayan\r\nwild goat, and which is itself much larger than any of the domesticated\r\nkinds].  Except just after changing their coats, when they are of a\r\ngreyish hue, the general colour of the ibex is a dirty yellowish brown.\r\nI have, however, killed the younger animals, both male and female, with\r\ntheir coats as red as that of a deer in his red coat; but never saw an\r\nold male of that colour, for the reason, I imagine, that he lives much\r\nhigher, and sheds his hair much later in the season.  The hair is short,\r\nsomething in texture like that of the _burrell_ and other wild sheep;\r\nand in the cold weather is mixed with a very soft downy wool, resembling\r\nthe shawl-wool of Thibet.  This and the old hair is shed in May and\r\nJune; and in districts occupied by the flocks at that season the bushes\r\nand sharp corners of rocks are covered with their cast-off winter coats.\r\nThe striking appearance of the ibex is chiefly owing to the noble\r\nhorns: which nature has bestowed upon it.  In full-grown animals the\r\nhorns, which curve gracefully over the shoulders, are from three to four\r\nfeet in length along the curve, and about eleven inches in circumference\r\nat the base.  Very few attain a greater length than four feet; but I\r\nhave heard of their being three inches longer.  Their beards, six or\r\neight inches in length, arc of shaggy black hair.  The females, light\r\ngreyish-brown in colour, are hardly a third the size of the males; and\r\ntheir horns are round and tapering, from ten inches to a foot in length.\r\nTheir appearance upon the whole is clean-made, agile, and graceful.\r\n\r\n\"`In the summer they everywhere resort to the highest accessible places\r\nwhere food can be found--often to a part of the country several marches\r\ndistant from their winter haunts.  This migration commences as soon as\r\nthe snow begins to disappear; and is very gradually performed--the\r\nanimals receding from hill to hill, and remaining a few days upon each.\r\n\r\n\"`At this season the males keep in large flocks, apart from the females;\r\nand as many as a hundred may occasionally be seen together.  During the\r\nheat of the day they rarely move about, but rest and sleep--either on\r\nthe beds of snow in the ravines, or on the rocks and shingly slopes of\r\nthe barren hill-sides, above the limits of vegetation.  Sometimes, but\r\nvery rarely, they will lie down on the grassy spots where they have been\r\nfeeding.  Towards evening they begin to move, and proceed to their\r\ngrazing-grounds--which are often miles away.  They set out walking\r\nslowly at first; but, if they have any considerable distance before\r\nthem, soon break into a trot; and sometimes the whole flock will go as\r\nhard as they can lay legs to the ground.  From what we could gather from\r\nthe natives, we concluded that they remain in these high regions until\r\nthe end of October; when they begin to mix with the females, and\r\ngradually descend to their winter resorts.  The females do not wander so\r\nmuch or so far--many remaining on the same ground throughout the year--\r\nand those that do visit the distant hills are generally found lower down\r\nthan the males, seldom ascending above the limits of vegetation.  They\r\nbring forth their young in July, having generally two at a birth;\r\nthough, like other gregarious animals, many are frequently found barren.\r\n\r\n\"`The ibex are wary animals, gifted with very sharp sight and an acute\r\nsense of smell.  They are very easily alarmed, and so wild, that a\r\nsingle shot fired at a flock is often sufficient to drive them away from\r\nthat particular range of hills they may be upon.  Even if not fired at,\r\nthe appearance of a human being near their haunt is not unfrequently\r\nattended with the same result.  Of this we had many instances during our\r\nrambles after them, and the very first flock of old males we found gave\r\nus a proof.  They were at the head of the Asrung valley, and we caught\r\nsight of them just as they were coming down the hill to feed--a noble\r\nflock of nearly a hundred old males.  It was late in the day, and we had\r\na long way to return to camp.  Prudence whispered, \"Let them alone till\r\nto-morrow,\" but excitement carried the day, and we tried the stalk.\r\nHaving but little daylight remaining, we may have hurried, and\r\nconsequently approached them with less caution than we should have done\r\nhad we had time before us.  However it might be, we failed; for long\r\nbefore we got within range, some of them discovered us, and the whole\r\nflock decamped without giving us the chance of a shot.  Not having fired\r\nat, or otherwise disturbed them, more than by approaching the flock, we\r\nwere in great hopes of finding them the next day; but that and several\r\nsucceeding ones were passed in a fruitless search.  They had entirely\r\nforsaken that range of hills.\r\n\r\n\"`All readers of natural history are familiar with the wonderful\r\nclimbing and saltatory powers of the ibex; and, although they cannot (as\r\nhas been described in print) make a spring and hang on by their horns\r\nuntil they gain footing, yet in reality, for such heavy-looking animals,\r\nthey get over the most inaccessible-looking places in an almost\r\nmiraculous manner.  Nothing seems to stop them, nor to impede in the\r\nleast their progress.  To see a flock, after being fired at, take a\r\ndirect line across country, which they often do, over all sorts of\r\nseemingly impassable ground; now along the naked face of an almost\r\nperpendicular rock, then across a formidable landslip, or an inclined\r\nplane of loose stones or sand, which the slightest touch sets in motion\r\nboth above and below; diving into chasms to which there seems no\r\npossible outlet, but instantly reappearing on the opposite side; never\r\ndeviating in the slightest from their course; and at the same time\r\ngetting over the ground at the rate of something like fifteen miles an\r\nhour, is a sight not easily to be forgotten.  There are few animals, if\r\nany, that excel the ibex in endurance and agility.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nA BATTLE OF BUCKS.\r\n\r\nKarl had scarcely finished speaking, when, as if to illustrate still\r\nfurther the habits of the ibex, a curious incident occurred to the\r\nanimal upon, which their eyes were fixed.\r\n\r\nIt ceased to be a solitary individual: for while they were gazing at it\r\nanother ibex made its appearance upon the cliff, advancing towards the\r\none first seen.  The new comer was also a male, as its huge\r\nscimitar-shaped horns testified; while in size, as in other respects, it\r\nresembled the one already on the rock as much as if they had been\r\nbrothers.  It was not likely they were so.  At all events the behaviour\r\nof the former evinced anything but a fraternal feeling.  On the\r\ncontrary, it was advancing with a hostile intent, as its attitudes\r\nclearly proved.  Its muzzle was turned downward and inward, until the\r\nbearded chin almost touched its chest; while the tips of its horns,\r\ninstead of being thrown back upon its shoulders--their usual position\r\nwhen the animal stands erect--were, elevated high in the air.  Moreover,\r\nits short tail, held upright and jerking about with a quick nervous\r\nmotion, told that the animal meditated mischief.  Even at so great a\r\ndistance the spectators could perceive this: for the forms of both the\r\nibex were so clearly outlined against the sky, that the slightest motion\r\non the part of either could be perceived with perfect distinctness.\r\n\r\nThe new comer, when first observed, appeared to be approaching by\r\nstealth--as if he intended to play the cowardly assassin, and butt the\r\nother over the cliff!  Indeed, this was his actual design, as was\r\ndiscovered in the sequel; and had the other only remained for six\r\nseconds longer in the attitude in which he had been first seen, his\r\nassailant would no doubt have at once succeeded in his treacherous\r\nintent.\r\n\r\nWe are sorry to have to say that he _did_ succeed--though not without a\r\nstruggle, and the risk of being himself compelled to take that desperate\r\nleap which he had designed for his antagonist.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the voice of Caspar that hindered the immediate\r\nexecution of this wicked intention; though, alas! it only stayed it for\r\na short time.  Caspar, on seeing the treacherous approach, had\r\ninvoluntarily uttered a cry of warning.  Though it could not have been\r\nunderstood by the imperilled ibex, it had the effect of startling him\r\nfrom his dreamy attitude, and causing him to look around.  In that look\r\nhe perceived his danger, and quick as thought, took measures to avert\r\nit.  Suddenly raising himself on his hind-legs, and using them as a\r\npivot, he wheeled about, and then came to the ground on all fours, face\r\nto face with his adversary.  He showed no sign of any desire to retreat,\r\nbut seemed to accept the challenge as a matter of course.  Indeed, from\r\nhis position, it would have been impossible for him to have retreated\r\nwith any chance of safety.  The cliff upon which he had been standing,\r\nwas a sort of promontory projecting beyond the general line of the\r\nprecipice; and towards the mountain slope above his escape had been\r\nalready cut off by his challenger.  On all other sides of him was the\r\nbeetling cliff.  He had no alternative but fight, or be \"knocked over.\"\r\nIt was less a matter of choice than necessity that determined him upon\r\nstanding his ground.\r\n\r\nThis determination he had just time to take, and just time to put\r\nhimself in an attitude of defence, when his antagonist charged towards\r\nhim.  Both animals, at the same instant, uttered a fierce, snorting\r\nsound, and rising upon their hind-legs, stood fronting each other like a\r\nbrace of bipeds.  In this movement the spectators recognised the exact\r\nmode of combat practised by common goats; for just in the same fashion\r\ndoes the ibex exhibit his prowess.  Instead of rushing _horizontally_,\r\nhead to head, and pressing each other backwards, as rams do in their\r\ncontests, the ibex after rearing aloft, come down again, horns foremost,\r\nusing the weight of their bodies as the propelling power, each\r\nendeavouring to crush the other between his massive crest and the earth.\r\nSeveral times in succession did the two combatants repeat their\r\nrearings aloft, and the downward strokes of their horns; but it soon\r\nbecame evident, that the one who had been the assailant was also to be\r\nthe conqueror.  He had an advantage in the ground: for the platform\r\nwhich his adversary occupied, and from which he could not escape, was\r\nnot wide enough to afford room for any violent movements; and the\r\nimminent danger of getting a hoof over the cliff, evidently inspired him\r\nwith fear and constraint.  The assailant having plenty of space to move\r\nin, was able to \"back and fill\" at pleasure, now receding foot by foot,\r\nthen rushing forward, rising erect, and striking down again.  Each time\r\nhe made his onslaught with renewed impetus, derived from the advantage\r\nof the ground, as well as the knowledge that if his blow failed, he\r\nshould only have to repeat it; whereas, on the part of his opponent, the\r\nfailure of a single stroke, or even of a guard, would almost to a\r\ncertainty be the prelude to his destruction.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that the ibex attacked was the weaker animal of the two,\r\nor whether the disadvantage of the ground was against him, it soon\r\nbecame evident that he was no match for his assailant.  From the very\r\nfirst, he appeared to act only on the defensive; and in all likelihood,\r\nhad the road been open to him, he would have turned tail at once, and\r\ntaken to his heels.\r\n\r\nBut no opportunity for flight was permitted him at any moment from the\r\nbeginning of the contest; and none was likely to be given him until it\r\nshould end.  The only chance of escape that appeared, even to him, was\r\nto make a grand leap, and clear his adversary, horns and all.\r\n\r\nThis idea seemed at length to take possession of his brain: for all on a\r\nsudden he was keen to forsake his attitude of defence, and bound high\r\ninto the air--as if to get over his adversary's horns, and hide himself\r\namong the safer snowdrifts of the mountains.\r\n\r\nIf such was his intent it proved a sad failure.  While soaring in the\r\nair--all his four feet raised high off the ground--the huge horns of his\r\nadversary were impelled with fearful force against his ribs, the stroke\r\ntossing him like a shuttlecock clear over the edge of the cliff!\r\n\r\nThe blow had been delivered so as to project his body with a revolving\r\nimpetus into the air; and turning round and round, it fell with a heavy\r\nconcussion into the bottom of the valley; where, after rebounding full\r\nsix feet from the ground, it fell back again dead as a stone.\r\n\r\nIt was some seconds before the spectators could recover from surprise at\r\nan incident so curious, though it was one that may often be witnessed by\r\nthose who wander among the wild crags of the Himalayas--where combats\r\nbetween the males of the ibex, the tahir, the burrell or Himalayan wild\r\nsheep, and also the rams of the gigantic _Ovis ammon_, are of common\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThese battles are often fought upon the edge of a beetling precipice--\r\nfor it is in such places that these four species of animals delight to\r\ndwell--and not unfrequently the issue of the contest is such as that\r\nwitnessed by our adventurers--one of the combatants being \"butted\" or\r\npushed right over the cliff.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that the animal thus put _hors de combat_ is always\r\nkilled.  On the contrary, unless the precipice be one of stupendous\r\nheight, an ibex, or tahir, or burrell, will get up again after one of\r\nthose fearful falls; and either run or limp away from the spot--perhaps\r\nto recover, and try his luck and strength in some future encounter with\r\nthe same adversary.  One of the most remarkable instances of this kind\r\nis related by the intelligent sportsman, Colonel Markham, and by him\r\nvouched for as a fact that came under his own observation.  We copy his\r\naccount verbatim:--\r\n\r\n\"I witnessed one of the most extraordinary feats performed by an old\r\ntahir, that I, or any other man, ever beheld.  I shot him when about\r\neighty yards overhead upon a ledge of rocks.  He fell perpendicularly\r\nthat distance, and, without touching the ground or the sides of the\r\nprecipice, rebounded, and fell again about fifteen yards further down.\r\nI thought he was knocked to atoms, but he got up and went off; and\r\nalthough we tracked him by his blood to a considerable distance, we were\r\nafter all unable to find him!\"\r\n\r\nMy young readers may remember that many similar feats have been\r\nwitnessed in the Rocky Mountains of America, performed by the\r\n\"bighorn\"--a wild sheep that inhabits these mountains, so closely\r\nresembling the _Ovis ammon_ of the Himalayas, as to be regarded by some\r\nnaturalists as belonging to the same species.  The hunters of the\r\nAmerican wilderness positively assert that the bighorn fearlessly flings\r\nhimself from high cliffs, alighting on his horns; and, then rebounding\r\ninto the air like an elastic ball, recovers his feet unhurt, and even\r\nunstunned by the tremendous \"header!\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt there is a good deal of exaggeration in these \"hunter stories;\"\r\nbut it is nevertheless true that most species of wild goats and sheep,\r\nas well as several of the rock-loving antelopes--the chamois and\r\nklipspringer, for instance--can do some prodigious feats in the leaping\r\nline, and such as it is difficult to believe in by any one not\r\naccustomed to the habits of these animals.  It is not easy to comprehend\r\nhow Colonel Markham's tahir could have fallen eighty yards--that is, 240\r\nfeet--to say nothing of the supplementary descent of forty-five feet\r\nfurther--without being smashed to \"smithereens.\"  But although we may\r\nhesitate to give credence to such an extraordinary statement, it would\r\nnot be a proper thing to give it a flat contradiction.  Who knows\r\nwhether there may not be in the bones of these animals some elastic\r\nprinciple or quality enabling them to counteract the effects of such\r\ngreat falls?  There are many mechanical contrivances of animal life as\r\nyet but very imperfectly understood; and it is well-known that Nature\r\nhas wonderfully adapted her creatures to the haunts and habits for which\r\nshe has designed them.  It may be, then, that these wild goats and\r\nsheep--the Blondins and Leotards of the quadruped world--are gifted with\r\ncertain saltatory powers, and furnished with structural contrivances\r\nwhich are altogether wanting to other animals not requiring them.  It\r\nwould not be right, therefore, without a better knowledge of the\r\nprinciples of animal mechanism, to contradict the statement of such a\r\nrespectable authority as Colonel Markham--especially since it appears to\r\nbe made in good faith, and without any motive for exaggeration.\r\n\r\nOur adventurers had entered into no discussion of this subject on\r\nobserving the descent of the ibex.  Indeed, there was nothing to suggest\r\nsuch speculations; for the creature had fallen from such an immense\r\nheight, and come down with \"such a thump\" upon the hard turf, that it\r\nnever occurred to any of them to fancy that there was a single gasp of\r\nbreath left in its body.  Nor was there; for on reaching the ground\r\nafter its rebound, the animal lay with limbs loose and limp, and without\r\nsign of motion--evidently a carcass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE BEARCOOTS.\r\n\r\nOur adventurers were congratulating themselves on this unexpected\r\naccession to their larder; which, like the manna of old, had, as it\r\nwere, rained down from the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Our dinner!\" shouted Caspar, gleefully, as the \"thump\" of the falling\r\nibex sounded in their ears.  \"Our supper, too,\" he added.  \"Ay, more!\r\nIn such a large carcass there must be provision to last us for a week!\"\r\n\r\nAll three rose to their feet, and were about starting forward to secure\r\nthe prize; when a shrill scream twice repeated fell upon their ears--\r\ncoming down apparently from the top of the cliffs, or rather from the\r\nmountain that trended still higher above them.\r\n\r\nCould it be the cry of the conquering ibex--his slogan of triumph?  No;\r\nit was not his voice, nor that of a quadruped of any kind.  Neither did\r\nthe spectators for an instant believe it to be so.  On turning their\r\neyes upward, they saw the creature, or the creatures--for there were two\r\nof them--from whose throats those screams had proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe victorious ibex was still standing conspicuously upon the cliff.\r\nDuring the few seconds that the attention of the spectators had been\r\noccupied elsewhere, he appeared to have been contemplating the dire deed\r\nof destruction he had just accomplished, and perhaps indulging in the\r\ntriumph he had obtained over his unfortunate rival.  At all events he\r\nhad stepped forward upon the projecting point of the rock--to the very\r\nspot so lately occupied by his adversary.\r\n\r\nThe cry, however, which had been heard in the valley below had reached\r\nhis ears at the same time, and perhaps a little sooner: for as the\r\nspectators looked up, they saw that he had been startled by it, and was\r\nlooking around him with evident alarm.  In the air above and not many\r\nyards distant from him, were two dark objects, easily recognisable as\r\nbirds upon the wing.  They were of large size, nearly black in colour,\r\nand with that peculiar sharpness of outline and sweep of wing that\r\ndistinguish the true birds of prey.  There was no mistaking their kind--\r\nthey were eagles--of a species known in the Himalayas and the steppes of\r\nThibet as the \"bearcoot.\"\r\n\r\nThey were swooping in short, abrupt curves, at intervals repeating their\r\nshrill screams, both crying out together, and from their excited mien,\r\nand the character of their movements, no doubt could be entertained as\r\nto the object of their noisy demonstrations.  They were about to assault\r\nan enemy, and that enemy was no other than the ibex.\r\n\r\nThe animal appeared to be fully aware of their intent; and seemed for a\r\nmoment to be irresolute as to how it should act.  Instead of placing\r\nitself in a bold, defiant attitude--such as it had lately assumed\r\ntowards an antagonist of its own kind--it stood cowering, and apparently\r\nparalysed with fear.  It was this very effect which the eagles, by their\r\nscreaming, had designed to produce; and certainly the fierce birds were\r\nsucceeding to the utmost of their expectations.\r\n\r\nThe spectators kept their eyes fixed upon the actors of this new drama--\r\nwatching every movement, both of the birds and the beast, with intense\r\ninterest.  All were desirous of seeing the latter punished for the cruel\r\nact he had just committed, and which they regarded as savouring very\r\nstrongly of fratricide.\r\n\r\nIt was written in the book of fate that their desire should be\r\ngratified, and that the destroyer should himself be destroyed.  They\r\nwere expecting to witness a somewhat prolonged combat; but in this\r\nexpectation they were disappointed.  The duration of the conflict was as\r\nbrief as the preliminaries that led to it; and these were of the\r\nshortest kind: for scarce ten seconds had elapsed, after they had\r\nuttered their first scream, before the bearcoots swooped down to the\r\nlevel of the cliff, and commenced a joint attack upon the ibex, striking\r\nat him alternately with beak and claws.\r\n\r\nFor a short time the quadruped was shrouded--almost hidden--under the\r\nbroad, shadowy wings of the birds; but even when its figure could be\r\ntraced, it appeared to be making no very energetic efforts at defending\r\nitself.  The sudden attack made by such strange enemies seemed to have\r\ncompletely disconcerted the ibex; and it remained as if still under the\r\nparalysis of fear.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment or two had passed, the ibex appeared to recover\r\nself-possession; and then he, rearing up, struck out with his horns.\r\nBut the bearcoots were on the alert; and each time that the animal\r\nattempted a forward movement, they easily avoided the blow by shying to\r\none side or the other; and then quickly wheeling, they would swoop back\r\nupon it from behind.\r\n\r\nIn this way was the conflict progressing, the ibex holding the ground\r\nupon which he had been first attacked, turning round and round, with his\r\ntwo fore hoofs held close together, or else rearing aloft on his\r\nhind-legs, and using them as a pivot.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better for the ibex had he kept to his fore-feet\r\naltogether; as in that attitude he might have held his ground a little\r\nlonger--perhaps until he had either beaten off his winged assailants, or\r\nwearied them out by a prolonged defence.\r\n\r\nBut to fight on \"all fours\" did not chance to be his fashion.  It was\r\ncontrary to the traditions of his family and race--all of whose members,\r\nfrom time immemorial, had been accustomed, when battling with an enemy,\r\nto stand erect upon their hind-legs.\r\n\r\nFollowing this fashion, he had raised himself to his full perpendicular,\r\nand was about aiming a \"butt\" against the breast of one of the bearcoots\r\nthat was tantalising him in front, when the other, that had made a short\r\nretrocession in order to gain impetus, came swooping back with the\r\nvelocity of an arrow, and seizing the ibex under the chin, by a quick,\r\nstrong jerk of its talons, it struck the head of the animal so far\r\nbackward that it lost its balance, and went toppling over the cliff.  In\r\nanother instant the ibex was in mid-air--falling--falling--through that\r\nsame fearful space that had just been traversed by his own victim.\r\n\r\nThe spectators looked to see him strike the ground without receiving\r\nfurther molestation from his winged assailants.  Not so, however, did it\r\nresult.  Just as the ibex had got about half-way down the face of the\r\nprecipice, the second eagle was seen shooting after him with the\r\nvelocity of a flash of lightning; and before he could reach the ground,\r\nthe bearcoot was seen striking him once more, and causing him to diverge\r\nfrom his vertical descent.  The body came to the ground at length--but\r\nat a considerable distance from where the other was lying--the eagle\r\ndescending with it to the earth, and even remaining over it with wings\r\nand limbs extended, as if still clutching it in his talons!\r\n\r\nWhy the bearcoot was thus retaining the ibex in his clutch was not quite\r\nso clear: for the animal was evidently dead; and apparently had been so\r\nlong before reaching the earth.  There was something strange about this\r\nproceeding on the part of the bird--as there had also been in its mode\r\nof descent through the last forty or fifty yards of space.  From the\r\nmanner in which it had extended its wings after striking its prey, and\r\nfrom the way in which it still kept exercising them, the spectators\r\nbegan to think that its singular descent, and its remaining over the\r\ncarcass in that cowering attitude, were neither of them voluntary acts\r\non its part.\r\n\r\nThe truth was soon made clear--proving the contrary to be the case: for\r\nas the bearcoot continued to flap its wings, or rather, flutter them in\r\na violent irregular motion, it became evident that instead of desiring\r\nto remain by the fallen body of its victim, it was doing its very best\r\nto get away from it!  This was all the more easily believed, when it\r\ncommenced uttering a series of wild screams; not as before indicating\r\nrage or menace, but in tones expressive of the greatest terror!\r\n\r\nThe spectators, who had already risen from their seats, ran towards the\r\nspot--surmising that there was something amiss.\r\n\r\nOn getting close up to the still screaming and fluttering bird, they\r\nwere able to understand what had appeared so incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nThey saw that the bearcoot was in a dilemma; that its talons were buried\r\nin the body of the ibex, and so firmly fixed, that with all the strength\r\nof its sinewy legs, backed by the power of its elastic pinions, it was\r\nunable to free itself!\r\n\r\nIn striking the ibex in his descent, the bird had buried its crooked\r\nclaws deeply into the soft abdomen of the animal, but in attempting to\r\ndraw them out again, had found--no doubt to its great chagrin--that the\r\nthick coating of \"poshm\" which covered the skin of the ibex, had become\r\nentangled round its shanks; and the more it fluttered to free itself,\r\nturning round and round in the effort, the stronger and tighter became\r\nthe rope which it was twisting out of that celebrated staple--the\r\nshawl-wool of Cashmere!\r\n\r\nBeyond a doubt the bearcoot was in a bad fix; and, although it was soon\r\nrelieved from its tether of _poshm_, it was only to find itself more\r\nsecurely tied by a stronger string taken out of the pocket of Ossaroo.\r\n\r\nThe other bearcoot having followed close after, seemed determined upon\r\nrescuing its mate out of the hands of its captors; and uttering loud\r\nscreams, it flew, first at one, then at another of them--with its long\r\npointed talons menacing each of them in turn.\r\n\r\nAs all of them had weapons in their hands, they succeeded in keeping the\r\nangry bird at bay, but it might not have fared so well with Fritz--who\r\nin turn became the object of its furious attack, and who had no weapon\r\nbut his teeth.\r\n\r\nThese would scarce have been sufficient protection against the talons of\r\nan eagle; and Fritz would very likely have lost one of his eyes, or\r\nperhaps both of them, had it not been for an arrow springing from the\r\nbow of the shikaree; which, transfixing the great bird right through the\r\ngizzard, brought it down with a \"flop\" upon the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt was not killed outright by the arrow; and the dog, on seeing it bite\r\nthe dust, would fain have \"jumped\" it.  But perceiving the strong\r\ncurving beak and the sharp talons extended towards him, Fritz was easily\r\npersuaded to remain at a prudent distance, and leave the shikaree to\r\nmake a finish of the bearcoot with his long boar-spear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\r\n\r\nA HOPE BUILT UPON THE BEARCOOT.\r\n\r\nIn this unexpected supply of food--which might be said almost literally\r\nto have descended from heaven--Karl could not help recognising the hand\r\nof Providence, and pointing it out to his companions.  Even the less\r\nreflecting mind of Caspar, and the half-heathen heart of the Hindoo,\r\nwere impressed with a belief that some other agency than mere chance had\r\nbefriended them; and they were only too willing to join with Karl in a\r\nprayerful expression of their gratitude to that Being who, although\r\nunseen, was with them even in that lone valley.\r\n\r\nFor a time they stood contemplating with curiosity, not only the two\r\nibex, but also the eagles--interesting on account of the knowledge that\r\nall four animals had but lately been roaming freely beyond the\r\nboundaries of that mountain prison--and had just arrived, as it were,\r\nfrom the outside world, with which they themselves so eagerly longed to\r\nhold communication.  What would they not have given to have been each\r\nprovided with a pair of wings like that bearcoot--the one that still\r\nlived?  Furnished in that fashion, they would soon have sought escape\r\nfrom the valley--to them a valley of tears--and from the snowy mountains\r\nthat surrounded it.\r\n\r\nWhile reflecting thus, a thought shaped itself in the mind of the\r\nphilosophic Karl, which caused his face to brighten up a little.  Only a\r\nlittle: for the idea which had occurred to him was not one of the\r\nbrightest.  There was something in it, however; and, as the drowning man\r\nwill clutch even at straws, Karl caught at a singular conception, and\r\nafter examining it a while, communicated it to the others.\r\n\r\nIt was the bearcoot that had brought forth this conception.  The bird\r\nwas a true eagle, strong of wing and muscle like all of his tribe, and\r\none of the strongest of the genus.  Like an arrow, he could fly straight\r\nup towards the sky.  In a few minutes--ay, in a few seconds--he could\r\neasily shoot up to the summits of the snowy mountains that towered above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"What is to hinder him?\" asked Karl, pointing to the bird, \"to carry--\"\r\n\r\n\"To carry what?\" said Caspar, interrupting the interrogation of his\r\nbrother, who spoke in a hesitating and doubtful manner.  \"Not us, Karl?\"\r\ncontinued he, with a slight touch of jocularity in his manner--\"you\r\ndon't mean that, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not us,\" gravely repeated Karl, \"but _a rope_ that may carry _us_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Caspar, a gleam of joy overspreading his face as he\r\nspoke.  \"There's something in that.\"\r\n\r\nOssaroo, equally interested in the dialogue, at the same moment gave\r\nutterance to a joyous ejaculation.\r\n\r\n\"What do _you_ think of it, shikaree?\" inquired Karl, speaking in a\r\nserious tone.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Ossaroo did not bespeak any very sanguine hope on his part.\r\nStill he was ready to counsel a trial of the scheme.  They could try it\r\nwithout any great trouble.  It would only need to spin some more rope\r\nfrom the hemp--of which they had plenty--attach it to the leg of the\r\nbearcoot, and give the bird its freedom.  There was no question as to\r\nthe direction the eagle would take.  He had already had enough of the\r\nvalley; and would no doubt make to get out of it at the very first\r\nflight he should be permitted to make.\r\n\r\nThe scheme superficially considered appeared plausible enough; but as\r\nits details were subjected to a more rigorous examination, two grand\r\ndifficulties presented themselves--so grand that they almost obliterated\r\nthe hope, so suddenly, and with too much facility, conceived.\r\n\r\nThe first of these difficulties was, that the bearcoot, notwithstanding\r\nhis great strength of wing, might not be able to carry up a rope, which\r\nwould be strong enough to carry one of themselves.  A cord he might\r\neasily take to the top of the cliff, or even far beyond; but a mere\r\ncord, or even a very slender rope, would be of no use.  It would need\r\none strong enough to support the body of a man--and that, too, while\r\nengaged in the violent exertion of climbing.  The rope would require to\r\nbe of great length--two hundred yards or more; and every yard would add\r\nto the weight the eagle would be required to carry up.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that they intended to \"swarm\" up this rope hand\r\nby hand.  For the height of a dozen yards or so, any of them could have\r\naccomplished that.  But there would be a hundred and fifty yards of\r\n\"swarming\" to be done before they could set foot upon the top of the\r\ncliff; and the smartest sailor that ever crawled up a main-stay--even\r\nSinbad himself--could not have done half the distance.  They had\r\nforeseen this difficulty from the very first; and the ingenuity of Karl\r\nhad at once provided a remedy for it--as will be seen in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe second question that presented itself was:--admitting that the\r\nbearcoot might bear up a rope stout enough for the purpose, whether\r\nthere would be any possibility of getting this rope stayed at the top?\r\n\r\nOf course, they could do nothing of themselves; and that point would be\r\na matter of mere chance.  There was a chance--all acknowledged that.\r\nThe bird, in fluttering over the mountain to make its escape, might\r\nentangle the rope around a rock, or some sharp angle of the frozen snow.\r\nThere was a chance, which could be determined by trying, and only by\r\ntrying; and there were certain probabilities in favour of success.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty--that relating to the strength and weight of the\r\nrope--admitted of rational discussion and calculation.  There were\r\n_data_ to go upon, and others that might be decided conjecturally, yet\r\nsufficiently near the truth for all preliminary purposes.  They could\r\ntell pretty nearly what stoutness of rope it would take to _hang_ any\r\none of them; and this would be strong enough to carry them up the cliff.\r\nThe strength of the eagle might also be presumed pretty nearly; and\r\nthere was no doubt but that the bearcoot would do his very best to get\r\nout of the valley.  After the rough handling he had already experienced,\r\nhe would not require any further stimulus to call forth his very utmost\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nOn discussing the subject in its different bearings, it soon became\r\nevident to all, that the matter of supreme importance would be the\r\nmaking of the rope.  Could this be manufactured of sufficient fineness\r\nnot to overburden the bearcoot, and yet be strong enough to sustain the\r\nweight of a man, the first difficulty would be got over.  The rope\r\ntherefore should be made with the greatest care.  Every fibre of it\r\nshould be of the best quality of hemp--every strand twisted with a\r\nperfect uniformity of thickness--every plait manipulated with an exact\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nOssaroo was the man to make such a cord.  He could spin it with as much\r\nevenness as a Manchester mill.  There would be no danger that in a rope\r\nof Ossaroo's making the most critical eye could detect either fault or\r\nflaw.\r\n\r\nIt was finally determined on that the rope should be spun--Ossaroo\r\nacting as director, the others becoming his attendants rather than his\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to work, however, it was deemed prudent to secure\r\nagainst a hungry day by curing the flesh of the brace of ibex.  The dead\r\nbearcoot was to be eaten while fresh, and needed no curing.\r\n\r\nAnd so indeed it was eaten--the bird of Jove furnishing them with a\r\ndinner, as that of Juno had given them a breakfast!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE LOG ON THE LEG.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had hung the ibex-meat upon the curing strings, and\r\npegged out the two skins for drying, they turned their attention to the\r\nmaking of the rope by which they were to be pulled out of their prison.\r\nBy good fortune they had a large stock of hemp on hand all ready for\r\ntwisting.  It was a store that had been saved up by Ossaroo--at the time\r\nwhen he had fabricated his fish-net; and as it had been kept in a little\r\ndry grotto of the cliff, it was still in excellent preservation.  They\r\nhad also on hand a very long rope, though, unfortunately, not long\r\nenough for their present purpose.  It was the same which they had used\r\nin projecting their tree-bridge across the crevasse; and which they had\r\nlong ago unrove from its pulleys, and brought home to the hut.  This\r\nrope was the exact thickness they would require: for anything of a more\r\nslender gauge would scarcely be sufficient to support the weight of a\r\nman's body; and considering the fearful risk they would have to run,\r\nwhile hanging by it against the face of such a cliff, it was necessary\r\nto keep on the safe side as regarded the strength of the rope.  They\r\ncould have made it of ample thickness and strength, so as to secure\r\nagainst the accident of its breaking.  But then, on the opposite hand,\r\narose the difficulty as to the strength of the eagle's wing.  Should the\r\nrope prove too heavy for the bearcoot to carry over the top of the\r\ncliff, then all their labour would be in vain.\r\n\r\n\"Why not ascertain this fact before making the rope?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a suggestion of Karl himself.\r\n\r\n\"But how are we to do it?\" was the rejoinder of Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"I think we can manage the matter,\" said the botanist, apparently\r\nbusying his brain with some profound calculation.\r\n\r\n\"I can't think of a way myself,\" replied Caspar, looking inquiringly at\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy I can,\" said Karl.  \"What is to hinder us to ascertain the\r\nweight of the rope before making it, and also decide as to whether the\r\nbird can carry so much?\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are you to weigh the rope until it is made?  You know it's the\r\ntrouble of making it we wish to avoid--that is, should it prove useless\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! as for that,\" rejoined Karl, \"it is not necessary to have it\r\nfinished to find out what weight it would be.  We know pretty near the\r\nlength that will be needed, and by weighing a piece of that already in\r\nour hands, we can calculate for any given length.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, brother Karl, that we have no means of weighing, even the\r\nsmallest piece.  We have neither beam, scales, nor weights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" replied Karl, with that tone of confidence imparted by superior\r\nknowledge.  \"There's no difficulty in obtaining all these.  Any piece of\r\nstraight stick becomes a beam, when properly balanced; and as for\r\nscales, they can be had as readily as a beam.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the weights?\" interrupted Caspar.  \"What about them?  Your beam and\r\nscales would be useless, I apprehend, without proper weights?  I think\r\nwe should be `stumped' for the want of the pounds and ounces.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am surprised, Caspar, you should be so unreflecting, and allow your\r\ningenuity to be so easily discouraged and thwarted.  I believe I could\r\nmake a set of weights under any circumstances in which you might place\r\nme--giving me only the raw material, such as a piece of timber and\r\nplenty of stones.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how, brother?  Pray, tell us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, in the first place, I know the weight of my own body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted.  But that is only one weight; how are you to get the\r\ndenominations--the pounds and ounces?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the beam I should construct I would balance my body against a lot of\r\nstones.  I should then divide the stones into two lots, and balance\r\nthese against one another.  I should thus get the half weight of my\r\nbody--a known quantity, you will recollect.  By again equally dividing\r\none of the lots I should find a standard of smaller dimensions; and so\r\non, till I had got a weight as small as might be needed.  By this\r\nprocess I can find a pound, an ounce, or any amount required.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, brother,\" replied Caspar, \"and very ingenious of you.  No\r\ndoubt your plan would do--but for one little circumstance, which you\r\nseem to have overlooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are your data quite correct?\" naively inquired Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"My data!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--the original standard from which you propose to start, and on\r\nwhich you would base your calculations.  I mean the _weight of your\r\nbody_.  Do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Karl; \"I am just 140 pounds weight--to an ounce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, brother,\" replied Caspar, with a shake of the head, expressive of\r\ndoubt, \"you _were_ 140 pounds in London--I know that myself--and so was\r\nI nearly as much; but you forget that the fret and worry of this\r\nmiserable existence has reduced both of us.  Indeed, dear brother, I can\r\nsee that you are much thinner since we set out from Calcutta; and no\r\ndoubt you can perceive the like change in me.  Is it not so?\"\r\n\r\nKarl was forced to give an affirmative reply to the question, at the\r\nsame time that he acknowledged the truth of his brother's statement.\r\nHis data were not correct.  The weight of his body--which, not being a\r\nconstant quantity, is at all times an unsafe standard--would not serve\r\nin the present instance.  The calculation they desired to make was of\r\ntoo important a character to be based upon such an untrustworthy\r\nfoundation.  Karl perceived this plainly enough; but it did not\r\ndiscourage him from prosecuting his purpose to make the attempt he had\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, brother!\" said he, looking smilingly towards the latter, and\r\napparently rather pleased at Caspar's acuteness; \"I acknowledge you have\r\nhad the better of the argument this time; but that's no reason why I\r\nshould give up my plan.  There are many other ways of ascertaining the\r\nweight of an object; and no doubt if I were to reflect a little I could\r\nhit upon one; but as luck has it, we need not trouble ourselves further\r\nabout that matter.  If I mistake not, we have a standard of weight in\r\nour possession, that is just the thing itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What standard?\" demanded Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"One of the leaden bullets of your own gun.  They are ounce bullets,\r\nI've heard you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are exactly sixteen to the pound, and therefore each of them an\r\nounce.  You are right, Karl, that is a standard.  Certainly it will do.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject required no further sifting; and without delay they\r\nproceeded to ascertain the weight of two hundred yards of rope.  A\r\nbalance was soon constructed and adjusted, as nicely as if they had\r\nmeant to put gold in the scale.  Twenty yards of the rope already in\r\nhand was set against stones--whose weight they had already determined by\r\nreduplicating a number of bullets--and its quantity ascertained in\r\npounds and ounces.  Eight times that gave one hundred and sixty yards--\r\nthe probable amount of cord they should require.\r\n\r\nThis being determined upon, the next thing was to find out whether the\r\neagle could carry such a burden into the sky.  Of course, the bird would\r\nnot have the whole of it to carry at first, as part would rest upon the\r\nground; but should it succeed in reaching the top of the cliff--even at\r\nthe lowest part--there would then be the weight of at least one hundred\r\nyards upon its leg; and if it ascended still higher, a greater amount in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nIt was natural to suppose that the bearcoot in going out would choose\r\nthe lowest part of the precipice--especially when feeling his flight\r\nimpeded by the strange attachment upon his leg; and if this conjecture\r\nshould prove correct, there would be all the less weight to be\r\nsustained.  But, indeed, by the cord itself they could guide the\r\nbearcoot to the lowest part--since by holding it in their hands, they\r\ncould hinder him taking flight in any other direction.\r\n\r\nConsidering all these circumstances, and rather cheered by the many\r\npoints that appeared to be in their favour, they proceeded to make trial\r\nof the eagle's strength.\r\n\r\nIt would not take long to decide; but conscious of the great importance\r\nof the result, they set about it with due deliberation.\r\n\r\nA log of wood was procured, and chopped down, till it was exactly the\r\nweight of the rope to be used.  To this the piece of twenty yards--\r\nalready employed for a different purpose--was attached at one end--the\r\nother being tightly knotted around the shank of the eagle.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, the bird was stripped of his other fastenings; and\r\nthen all retired to a distance to give him space for the free use of his\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nFancying himself no longer under restraint, the bearcoot sprang up from\r\nthe rock on which he had been placed; and, spreading his broad wings,\r\nrose almost vertically into the air.\r\n\r\nFor the first twenty yards he mounted with a vigorous velocity; and the\r\nhopes of the spectators found utterance in joyful ejaculations.\r\n\r\nAlas! these hopes were short-lived, ending almost on the instant of\r\ntheir conception.  The rope, carried to its full length, became suddenly\r\ntaut--jerking the eagle several feet back towards the earth.  At the\r\nsame time the log was lifted only a few inches from the ground.  The\r\nbird fluttered a moment, taken aback by this unexpected interruption;\r\nand, after recovering its equilibrium, again essayed a second flight\r\ntowards the sky.\r\n\r\nOnce more the rope tightened--as before raising the log but very little\r\nfrom the ground--while the eagle, as if this time expecting the pluck,\r\nsuffered less derangement of its flight than on the former occasion.\r\nFor all that, it was borne back, until its anchor \"touched bottom.\"\r\nThen after making another upward effort, with the like result, it\r\nappeared to become convinced of its inability to rise vertically, and\r\ndirected its flight in a horizontal line along the cliffs.  The log was\r\njerked over the ground, bounding from point to point, occasionally\r\nswinging in the air, but only for a few seconds at a time.\r\n\r\nAt length the conviction forced itself upon the minds of the\r\nspectators--as it seemed also to have done upon that of the performer--\r\nthat to reach the top of the cliff--with a cord upon its leg, equal in\r\nweight to that log--was more than a bearcoot could accomplish.\r\n\r\nIn short, the plan had proved a failure; and, no longer hoping for\r\nsuccess, our adventurers turned their disappointed looks upon each\r\nother--leaving the eagle free to drag his wooden anchor whithersoever he\r\nmight wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nFURTHER EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe usual silence which succeeds a disappointment was for some time\r\npreserved by the three individuals who had been spectators of the\r\nunsuccessful attempt of the eagle.  Caspar seemed less cast down than\r\nthe others; but why it was so, neither of them thought of asking him.\r\n\r\nIt was not a silence of very long duration, nor was the chagrin that had\r\ncaused it of much longer continuance.  Both were evanescent as the\r\nsummer cloud that for a moment darkens the sky, and then glides off--\r\nleaving it bright and serene as ever.\r\n\r\nIt was to Caspar the party was indebted for this happy change of\r\nfeeling.  An idea had occurred to the young hunter--or rather a new\r\nscheme--which was at once communicated to his companions.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, Caspar's scheme could not be termed a _new_ one.  It\r\nwas only supplementary to that already set before them by Karl; and the\r\nbearcoot, as before, was to be the chief actor in it.\r\n\r\nWhile calculating the length of rope it would take to reach to the top\r\nof the cliff, Caspar had already bethought him of a way by which it\r\nmight be shortened--in other words, how it might be arranged, that a\r\nshorter rope would suffice.  He had for some time carried this idea in\r\nhis mind; but had declined communicating it, to the others, until after\r\nwitnessing the test of the eagle's strength.  Now that the bearcoot had\r\nbeen \"weighed and found wanting,\" you might suppose that the creature\r\nwould be no longer cared for--excepting to furnish them with a meal.\r\nThis was the reflection of Karl and Ossaroo; but Caspar thought\r\ndifferently.  He was impressed with a belief, that the bird might still\r\ndo them a service--the very one which he had undertaken so\r\nunsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nCaspar reflected, and very correctly: that it was the extra weight that\r\nhad hindered the eagle from ascending.  It was not so much beyond his\r\nstrength neither.  Perhaps had it been only half as heavy, or even a\r\nlittle more, he might have succeeded in carrying it over the cliff.\r\n\r\nWhat if the weight should be reduced?\r\n\r\nTo make the rope more slender did not enter into Caspar's calculations.\r\nHe knew this could not be done: since it was a point already discussed\r\nand decided upon.\r\n\r\nBut how if the rope were to be _shorter_, than that which had been\r\ntheoretically considered?  How if it were to be only fifty yards,\r\ninstead of one hundred and fifty?  Of course, then the eagle might fly\r\nwith it, to whatever height its length would allow.\r\n\r\nCaspar felt satisfied of this fact; nor did either of the others\r\nquestion its truth--but what then?\r\n\r\n\"What,\" inquired Karl, \"would be the use of a rope of fifty yards,\r\nthough the eagle might carry it up to the moon?  Even at the lowest part\r\nof the cliffs--should the bearcoot take one end over, the other would be\r\nfifty yards above our heads?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a yard, brother--not a foot.  The other end would be in our hands--\r\nin our hands, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Caspar,\" calmly rejoined the philosopher, \"you appear to be\r\nconfident enough; though I can't guess what you are driving at.  You\r\nknow this hideous precipice is at no point less than a hundred yards in\r\nsheer height?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" replied Caspar, still speaking in the same tone of confidence;\r\n\"but a rope of only fifty--ay, of not more than half that length--may be\r\nheld in our hands, while the other end is over the top of the cliff.\"\r\n\r\nKarl looked perplexed; but the shikaree, on this occasion quicker of\r\nperception than the philosopher, catching at Caspar's meaning, cried\r\nout:--\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha! young sahib meanee from top ob da ladder!  Dat meanee he.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so,\" said Caspar; \"you've guessed right, Ossy.  I mean just\r\nthat very thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! then, indeed,\" said Karl, in a drawling tone, at the same time\r\nlapsing into a reflective silence.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right, brother,\" he added, after a pause.  \"At all\r\nevents, it will be easy to try.  If your scheme succeed, we shall not\r\nrequire to make any more cord.  What we have will be sufficient.  Let us\r\nmake trial at once!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the bearcoot?\" asked Caspar, looking around to discover the\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n\"Yonner be he, young sahib,\" answered Ossaroo, pointing towards the\r\nprecipice; \"yonner sitee he--ober da rock.\"\r\n\r\nThe eagle was perceived, perched, or rather crouching, on a low ledge of\r\nthe cliff,--upon which it had dropped down after its unsuccessful\r\nattempt at flight.  It looked crestfallen, and as if it would suffer\r\nitself to be caught by the hand.  But as Ossaroo approached it with this\r\nintention, the bird seemed to fancy itself free, and once more rose,\r\nwith a bold swoop, into the air.\r\n\r\nIt was only to feel the check-string tighten afresh upon his leg.  It\r\ncame fluttering down again, first drawn back by the weight of the log,\r\nand afterwards by the strong arm of the shikaree.\r\n\r\nThe log was now removed; and the whole rope they had on hand--a length\r\nof rather more than fifty yards--was knotted in its place.\r\n\r\nThe bearcoot was again set free--Ossaroo taking care to keep the leash\r\nwell in hand; and now the beautiful bird of Jove rose into the air, as\r\nif not the summit of the cliff, but the proud peak of Chumulari, was to\r\nbe the limit of its flight.\r\n\r\nAt the height of fifty yards its soaring ambition was suddenly curbed,\r\nby the check-string of Ossaroo, reminding it that it was still a\r\ncaptive.\r\n\r\nThe experiment had proved successful.  Caspar's plan promised well; and\r\nthey at once proceeded to take the necessary steps for carrying it into\r\npractical effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE EAGLE'S ESCAPE.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done, was to look to the quality of the rope, and\r\ntest its strength.  The ladders were already in place, just as they had\r\nbeen left.  The rope once _proved_, there would be nothing further to\r\ndo, but make it secure to the shank of the bearcoot; ascend the cliff to\r\nthe highest ledge, reached by the ladders; and then fly the bird.\r\n\r\nShould they succeed in getting the creature to go over the cliff--and by\r\nsome means entangle the cord at the top--they might consider themselves\r\nfree.  The very thought of such a result--now apparently certain--once\r\nmore raised their spirits to the highest pitch.\r\n\r\nThey did not count on being able to \"swarm\" up a piece of slender cord\r\nof nearly fifty yards in length--a feat that would have baffled the most\r\nagile tar that ever \"slung the monkey\" from a topgallant stay.  They had\r\nno thoughts of climbing the rope in that way; but in another, long\r\nbefore conceived and discussed.  They intended--once they should be\r\nassured that the cord was secure above--to make steps upon it, by\r\ninserting little pieces of wood between the \"strands;\" and these, which\r\nthey could fix at long distances, one after the other, would form\r\nsupports, upon which they might rest their feet in the ascent.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, all this had been settled beforehand; and no longer\r\noccupied their attention--now wholly absorbed in contriving some way to\r\nprove the reliability of the rope, upon which their lives were about to\r\nbe imperilled.\r\n\r\nIt was not deemed sufficient to tie the rope to a tree, and pull upon it\r\nwith all their united strength.  Karl and Caspar thought this would be a\r\nsufficient test; but Ossaroo was of a different opinion.  A better\r\nplan--according to the shikaree's way of thinking--was one which had\r\ngenerated in his oriental brain; and which, without heeding the\r\nremonstrances of the others, he proceeded to make trial of.  Taking one\r\nend of the rope with him, he climbed into a tall tree; and, after\r\ngetting some way out on a horizontal branch--full fifty feet from the\r\nground--he there fastened the cord securely.  By his directions the\r\nyoung sahibs laid hold below; and, both together, raising their feet\r\nfrom the ground, remained for some seconds suspended in the air.\r\n\r\nAs the rope showed no symptoms either of stretching or breaking under\r\nthe weight of both, it was evident that it might, under any\r\ncircumstances, be trusted to carry the weight of one; and in this\r\nconfidence, the shikaree descended from the tree.\r\n\r\nWith the eagle carried under his right arm, and the coil of rope\r\nswinging over his left, Ossaroo now proceeded towards the place where\r\nthe ladders rested against the cliff.  Karl and Caspar walked close\r\nafter, with Fritz following in the rear--all four moving in silence, and\r\nwith a certain solemnity of look and gesture--as befitted the important\r\nbusiness upon which they were bent.\r\n\r\nThe new experiment, like the trial of the eagle's strength, did not\r\noccupy any great length of time.  Had it proved successful, our\r\nadventurers would have been longer occupied, and in the end would have\r\nbeen seen triumphantly standing upon the summit of the cliff--with Fritz\r\nfrisking up the snowy slope beyond, as if he intended to chase the great\r\n_ovis ammon_ upon the heaven-kissing crest of Chumulari.\r\n\r\nAh! how different was the spectacle presented on the evening of that\r\neventful day!  A little before sunset the three adventurers were seen\r\nslowly and sadly returning to their hut--that despised hovel, under\r\nwhose homely roof they had hoped never to seek shelter again!\r\n\r\nAlas! in the now lengthened list of their unsuccessful struggles, they\r\nhad once more to record a failure!\r\n\r\nOssaroo, bearing the bearcoot under his arm, had climbed the ladders up\r\nto the highest ledge that could be attained.  From it he had \"flown\" the\r\neagle--freely dealing out all the cord in his possession.  That was a\r\nperilous experiment for the shikaree to make; and came very near proving\r\nthe last act in the drama of his life.\r\n\r\nThinking that the bearcoot would rise upward into the air, he had not\r\nthought of anything else; and as he stood balancing himself on that\r\nnarrow shelf, he was but ill prepared for what actually came to pass.\r\nInstead of soaring upwards, the eagle struck out in a horizontal\r\ndirection, not changing its course till it had reached the end of its\r\ntether; and then not changing it, nor even pausing in its flight, but\r\nwith the fifty yards of rope trailing behind it--which, fortunately for\r\nOssaroo, he was himself no longer at the end of--it continued on across\r\nthe valley towards the cliffs on the opposite side--the summit of which\r\nit would have no difficulty in attaining by following the diagonal line\r\nin which it was making that unexpected escape from the clutches of the\r\nshikaree.\r\n\r\nNot without chagrin did Karl and Caspar behold the spectacle of the\r\nbearcoot's departure; and for a while they were under the impression\r\nthat Ossaroo had bungled the business with which he had been entrusted.\r\n\r\nOssaroo's explanations, however, were soon after received; and proved\r\nsatisfactory.  It was evident from these, that had he not let go in the\r\nright time, he would have been compelled to make a leap, that would have\r\nleft him no opportunity for explaining the nature of the eagle's escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY.\r\n\r\nFRITZ AND THE FALCONS.\r\n\r\nWith feelings of sad and bitter disappointment did our adventurers turn\r\ntheir backs upon these ladders--that had once more deluded them--and\r\nmake their way towards the hut.\r\n\r\nAs upon the former occasion, they walked with slow steps and downcast\r\nmien.  Fritz, by his slouching gait and drooped tail, showed that he\r\nshared the general despondency.\r\n\r\nThey had arrived nearly at the hut, before any of the three thought of\r\nspeaking; when the sight of that rude homestead, to which they had so\r\noften fancied themselves on the eve of bidding farewell--and to which as\r\noften had they been compelled to return--suggested a theme to Karl:\r\ncausing him to break silence as they advanced towards the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Our true friend,\" said he, pointing to the hovel, \"a friend, when all\r\nelse fails us.  Rough it is--like many a friend that is nevertheless\r\nworthy.  I begin to like its honest look, and feel regard for it as one\r\nshould for a home.\"\r\n\r\nCaspar said nothing in reply.  He only sighed.  The young chamois-hunter\r\nof the Bavarian Alps thought of another home--far away towards the\r\nsetting sun; and, so long as that thought was in his mind, he could\r\nnever reconcile himself to a forced residence in the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts of Ossaroo were equally absent from that spot.  He was\r\nthinking of a bamboo hut by the borders of some crystal stream,\r\novershadowed by palms and other tropical trees.  He was thinking still\r\nmore of rice curry and chutnee; but above all, of his beloved \"betel,\"\r\nfor which the \"bang\" of the _cannabis sativa_ was but a poor substitute.\r\n\r\nBut Caspar had another thought in his mind; one which proved that he had\r\nnot yet abandoned all hope of returning to the home of his nativity;\r\nand, after they had finished eating their supper of broiled venison, he\r\ngave utterance to it.\r\n\r\nHe had not volunteered to break the silence.  It was done in obedience\r\nto a request of Karl who, having noticed the abstracted air of his\r\nbrother, had asked for an explanation.\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking,\" said Caspar, \"ever since the eagle has escaped us,\r\nof another bird I know something about--one that might perform the\r\nservice we want quite as well, if not better, than a bearcoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another bird!\" inquired Karl; \"of what bird are you speaking?  Do you\r\nmean one of those Brahminy geese upon the lake?  We might catch one\r\nalive, it is true; but let me tell you, brother, that their wings are\r\nconstructed just strong enough to carry their own ponderous bodies; and\r\nif you added another pound or two, by tying a cord to their legs, they\r\ncould no more mount out of this valley than we can.  No--no.  I fancy we\r\nmay as well give up that idea.  There's no bird but an eagle with wing\r\nstrong enough to do what you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bird I was thinking of,\" rejoined Caspar, \"is of the same _genus_\r\nas the eagle.  I believe that's correctly scientific language.  Isn't\r\nit, my Buffon of a brother?  Ha! ha!  Well, shall I name it?  Surely,\r\nyou have already divined the sort of bird to which I allude?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Karl.  \"There are no other birds in this valley of\r\nthe same genus as the eagle--except hawks; and according to the closet\r\nnaturalists, they are not of the same genus--only of the same _family_.\r\nIf you mean a hawk, there are several species in this place; but the\r\nlargest of them could not carry anything over the cliff heavier than a\r\nstring of twine.  See, there's a brace of them now!\" continued Karl,\r\npointing to two birds that were circling in the air, some twenty yards\r\noverhead.  \"`Churk' falcons they are called.  They are the largest of\r\nthe Himalayan hawks.  Are these your birds, brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"A couple of kites, are they not?\" interrogated Caspar, turning his eyes\r\nupward, and regarding the two winged creatures circling above, and\r\nquartering the air as if in search of prey.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the naturalist, \"they are of that species; and,\r\ncorrectly described, of the same genus as the eagles.  You don't mean\r\nthem, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not exactly,\" replied Caspar, in a drawling tone, and smiling\r\nsignificantly as he spoke; \"but if they be _kites_--Ho! what now?\"\r\nexclaimed the speaker, his train of thought, as well as speech, suddenly\r\ninterrupted by a movement on the part of the falcons.  \"What the\r\nmischief are the birds about?  As I live, they seem to be making an\r\nattack upon Fritz!  Surely they don't suppose they have the strength to\r\ndo any damage to our brave old dog?\"\r\n\r\nAs Caspar spoke, the two falcons were seen suddenly to descend--from the\r\nelevation at which they had been soaring--and then sweep in quick short\r\ncircles around the head of the Bavarian boar-hound--where he squatted on\r\nthe ground, near a little copse, some twenty yards from the hut.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps their nest is there--in the copse?\" suggested Karl; \"That's why\r\nthey are angry with the dog: for angry they certainly appear to be.\"\r\n\r\nSo any one might have reasoned, from the behaviour of the birds, as they\r\ncontinued their attack upon the dog--now rising some feet above him, and\r\nthen darting downward in a sort of parabolic curve--at each swoop\r\ndrawing nearer and nearer, until the tips of their wings were almost\r\nflapped in his face.  These movements were not made in silence: for the\r\nfalcons, as they flew, kept uttering their shrill cries--that sounded\r\nlike the voice of a pair of angry vixens.\r\n\r\n\"Their young must be near?\" suggested Karl.\r\n\r\n\"No, sahib,\" said Ossaroo, \"no nest--no chickee.  Fritz he hab suppa--de\r\npiece ob meat ob da ibex.  Churk wantee take de dog suppa away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Fritz is eating something, is he?\" said Caspar.  \"That explains it\r\nthen.  How very stupid of these birds, to fancy they could steal his\r\nsupper from our valiant Fritz: more especially since he seems to relish\r\nit so much himself!  Why he takes no notice of them!\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite true that Fritz, up to this time, had scarcely noticed the\r\nbrace of winged assailants; and their hostile demonstrations had only\r\ndrawn from him an occasional \"yir.\"  As they swooped nearer, however,\r\nand the tips of their wings were \"wopped\" into his very eyes, the thing\r\nwas growing unbearable; and Fritz began to lose temper.  His \"yirs\"\r\nbecame more frequent; and once or twice he rose from his squatting\r\nattitude, and made a snap at the feathers that were nearest.\r\n\r\nFor more than five minutes this curious play was kept up between the\r\nboar-hound and the birds; and then the episode was brought to a somewhat\r\nsingular--and in Fritz's estimation, no doubt--a very unpleasant\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nFrom the first commencement of their attack, the two falcons had\r\nfollowed a separate course of action.  One appeared to make all its\r\napproaches from the front; while the other confined its attacks\r\nexclusively to Fritz's rear.  In consequence of these tactics on the\r\npart of his assailants, the dog was compelled to defend himself both\r\nbefore and behind: and to do this, it became necessary for him to look\r\n\"two ways at once.\"  Now, he would snarl and snap at the assailant in\r\nfront--anon, he must sieve himself round, and in like manner menace the\r\nmore cowardly \"churk\" that was attacking him in the rear.  Of the two,\r\nhowever, the latter was the more demonstrative and noisy; and at length,\r\nnot content with giving Fritz an occasional \"wop\" with its wing, it had\r\nthe daring audacity to strike its sharp talons into a part of his\r\nposteriors approximate to the seat of honour.\r\n\r\nThis was something more than canine flesh and blood could bear; and\r\nFritz determined not to submit to it any longer.  Dropping the \"quid\" he\r\nhad been chewing, he started up on all fours; wheeled suddenly towards\r\nthe kite that had clawed him; and bounded aloft into the air with the\r\ndesign of clutching it.\r\n\r\nBut the wary bird had foreseen this action on the part of the quadruped;\r\nand, ere the latter could lay a fang upon it, had soared off--far beyond\r\nthe highest leap that any four-footed creature might accomplish.\r\n\r\nFritz, with a disappointed growl, turned round again to betake himself\r\nto his piece of meat; but still more disappointed was his look, when he\r\nperceived that the latter was no longer within reach!  Churk falcon\r\nnumber one had clawed him over the croup, but churk falcon number two\r\nhad deprived him of his supper!\r\n\r\nThe last look Fritz ever had of that piece of ibex venison, was seeing\r\nit in the beak of the bird, high up in air, growing smaller by degrees\r\nand beautifully less--until it disappeared altogether in the dim\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY ONE.\r\n\r\nFRITZ OFFENDED.\r\n\r\nThis odd little episode, between the boar-hound and the churk falcons,\r\nhad interrupted the conversation of the two brothers on the subject\r\nwhich Caspar had introduced.  Nor was it resumed immediately, on the\r\ntermination of the affair: for the look with which Fritz regarded the\r\ndeparture of the bird, that had so adroitly bilked him out of his bit of\r\nvenison, was so supremely ludicrous, as to elicit long loud peals of\r\nlaughter from the spectators.\r\n\r\nFritz's \"countenance\" betrayed the presence of rare emotions.  Profound\r\nsurprise and chagrin--strongly blended with a feeling of concentrated\r\nrage--were visible not only in his eyes, but his attitude, and, for some\r\ntime, he stood with head erect and muzzle high in air, his glances\r\nspeaking unutterable vows of vengeance, as they followed the flight of\r\nthe falcons.\r\n\r\nNever in all his life--not even when the trunk of the elephant was\r\ntrumpeting at his tail--had Fritz so sensibly felt the want of wings.\r\nNever had he so regretted the deficiency in his structure that left him\r\nwithout those useful appendages; and had he been gifted with the \"wand\r\nof a fairy,\" the use to which he would at that moment have applied it\r\nwould have been to furnish himself with a pair, not of \"beautiful\r\nwings\"--for that was a secondary consideration--but of strong and long\r\nones, such as would have enabled him to overhaul those churk falcons,\r\nand punish them for their unheard-of audacity.\r\n\r\nFor more than a minute Fritz preserved the attitude to which we have\r\nalluded: the demeanour of a dog that had been regularly duped and \"sold\"\r\nby a brace of beings, for whose strength and capacity he had exhibited\r\nsupreme contempt; and it was this mingling of surprise and rage that\r\nimparted to him that serio-comic appearance that had set them all\r\na-laughing.  Nor was his countenance less ludicrous under the expression\r\nwith which, on turning round, he regarded his trio of human companions.\r\nHe saw that they were making merry at his expense; and his look of\r\nhalf-reproach half-appeal had no other effect than to redouble their\r\nmirth.  Glancing from one to the other, he appeared to seek sympathy\r\nfrom each in turn--from Karl, Caspar, and Ossaroo.\r\n\r\nIt was an idle appeal.  All three had equally surrendered themselves to\r\nhilarity--unsympathetic, as it was uncontrollable.  Fritz had not a\r\nfriend on the ground.\r\n\r\nFull ten minutes must have elapsed before any of them could check his\r\nloud cachinnations; but long before that time, the butt of their\r\nridicule had betaken himself out of sight--having moved away from the\r\nspot, where he had been robbed of his supper, and retired, with an\r\noffended and sneaking air, to the more friendly concealment of the\r\nhovel.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before our adventurers could recover their serious\r\nmood; but the subject of their mirth being now out of their sight, went\r\ngradually also out of their minds.\r\n\r\nIt might be wondered that, circumstanced as they were, they had thus\r\ngiven way to a fit of jollity.  But, indeed, there was nothing wonderful\r\nabout it.  On the contrary, it was perfectly natural--perfectly true to\r\nthe instincts of the human soul--to be thus stirred: joy and sorrow\r\nfollowing each other in periodic succession--as certainly as day follows\r\nnight, or fair weather succeeds to the storm.\r\n\r\nThough we know not the why and the wherefore of this, we can easily\r\nbelieve that a wise Providence has ordered it so.  A poet who has sung\r\nsweetly says, that:--\r\n\r\n  \"Spring would be but gloomy weather,\r\n  If we had nothing else but Spring;\"\r\n\r\nand our own experience proclaims the truth conveyed in the distich.\r\n\r\nHe who has lived in the tropical lands of ever-spring--where the leaves\r\nnever fall, and the flowers never fade--can well confirm the fact: that\r\neven spring itself may in time become tiresome!  We long for the\r\nwinter--its frost and snow, and cold bitter winds.  Though ever so\r\nenamoured of the gay green forest, we like at intervals to behold it in\r\nits russet garb, with the sky in its coat of grey, sombre but\r\npicturesque.  Strange as it may appear, it is true: the moral, like the\r\nnatural atmosphere, stands in need of the storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY TWO.\r\n\r\nA KITE!\r\n\r\nAs soon as their mirth had fairly subsided, Karl and Caspar resumed the\r\nconversation, which had been broken off so abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"And so, brother,\" said Karl, who was the first to return to the\r\nsubject, \"you say there is a bird of the eagle genus, that might carry a\r\nrope over the cliff for us.  Of what bird are you speaking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Karl, you are dull of comprehension this morning.  Surely the\r\npresence of the two _kites_ should have suggested what I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! you mean a kite, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, one with a very broad breast, a very thin body, and a very long\r\ntail: such as you and I used to make not so many years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"A _paper kite_,\" said Karl, repeating the phrase mechanically, at the\r\nsame time settling down, into a reflecting attitude.  \"True, brother,\"\r\nhe added, after a pause; \"there might be something in what you have\r\nsuggested.  If we had a paper kite--that is, a very large one--it is\r\npossible it would carry a rope over the summit of the cliff; but,\r\nalas!--\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not proceed further, Karl,\" said Caspar, interrupting him.  \"I\r\nknow what you are going to say: that we have no paper out of which to\r\nmake the kite; and that, of course, puts an end to the matter.  It's no\r\nuse our thinking any more about it: since we have not got the materials.\r\nThe body and bones we could easily construct; and the tail too.  But\r\nthen the wings--ah, the wings.  I only wish we had a file of old\r\nnewspapers.  But what's the use of wishing?  We haven't.\"\r\n\r\nKarl, though silent, did not seem to hear, or at all events heed, what\r\nCaspar had been just saying.  He appeared to be buried either in a\r\nreverie, or in some profound speculation.\r\n\r\nIt was the latter: as was very soon after made manifest by his speech.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said he, with a hopeful glance towards the wood, \"we may not\r\nbe so deficient in the material of which you have spoken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of paper, do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are in the very region of the world where it grows,\" continued Karl,\r\nwithout heeding the interrogation.\r\n\r\n\"What! where paper _grows_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Karl, \"I do not mean that the paper itself grows here; but\r\na `fabric' out of which that useful article may be made.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that, brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a tree, or rather a shrub, belonging to the order of the\r\n_Thymelaceae_, or `Daphnads.'  The plants of this order are found in\r\nmany countries; but chiefly in the cooler regions of India and South\r\nAmerica.  There are even representatives of the order in England: for\r\nthe beautiful `spurge laurel' of the woods and hedges--known as a remedy\r\nfor the toothache--is a true daphnad.  Perhaps the most curious of all\r\nthe Thymelaceae is the celebrated Lagetta, or lace-bark tree of Jamaica;\r\nout of which the ladies of that island know how to manufacture cuffs,\r\ncollars, and berthas, that, when cut into the proper shapes, and\r\nbleached to a perfect whiteness, have all the appearance of real lace!\r\nThe Maroons, and other runaway negroes of Jamaica, before the abolition\r\nof slavery, used to make clothing out of the lagetta; which they found\r\ngrowing in plenty in the mountain forests of the island.  Previous also\r\nto the same abolition of slavery, there was another, and less gentle,\r\nuse made of the lace-bark, by the masters of these same negroes.  The\r\ncruel tyrants used to spin its tough fibres into thongs for their\r\nslave-whips.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think that paper can be made out of these trees?\" asked Caspar,\r\nimpatient to know whether there might be any chance of procuring some\r\nfor the covering of a kite.\r\n\r\n\"There are several species of daphnads,\" replied the botanist, \"whose\r\nbark can be converted into paper.  Some are found at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, and others in the island of Madagascar; but the best kinds for the\r\npurpose grow in these very mountains, and in China.  There is the\r\n`Daphne Bholua,' in Nepaul; from which the Nepaulese make a strong,\r\ntough, packing-paper; and I have reason to believe that it also grows in\r\nthe Bhotan Himalayas--at no very great distance from our position here.\r\nBesides, in China and Japan, on the other side of these mountains, there\r\nare two or three distinct kinds of the same plant--out of which the\r\nChinese make the yellowish-coloured paper, you may have seen in their\r\nbooks, and pasted upon their tea-chests.  So then,\" added the botanist,\r\nlooking wistfully towards the woods, \"since the paper-yielding daphne\r\ngrows in China, to the east of us, and in Nepaul and Bhotan to the west,\r\nit is but reasonable to conclude that some species of it may be found in\r\nthis valley--where the climate is just that which it affects.  Its seed\r\nmay have been transported hither by birds: since many species of birds\r\nare fond of its berries, and eat them without receiving any injury;\r\nthough, strange to say, they are poisonous to all kinds of quadrupeds!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you would know the shrub, if you saw it, brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to say the truth, I do not think I could recognise it by its\r\ngeneral appearance; but if I had a flower of the _daphne_, I could no\r\ndoubt tell it by its botanical characteristics.  The leaves of the\r\npaper-yielding species are of a lanceolate form and purplish hue,\r\nglabrous and shining, like the leaves of laurels--to which genus the\r\n_daphne_ is closely allied.  Unfortunately, the shrub would not be in\r\nflower at this season; but if we can find one of the berries, and a leaf\r\nor two, I fancy I shall be able to identify it.  Besides, the bark,\r\nwhich is very tough, would help to guide us.  Indeed, I have some reason\r\nto think that we shall find it not far off; and that is why I speak with\r\nsuch confidence, in saying, that we might not be so deficient in the\r\nmaterials for paper-making.\"\r\n\r\n\"What reason, brother Karl?  Perhaps you have seen something like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.  Some time ago, when I was strolling about, I passed through a\r\nthicket of low shrubs--the tops of which reached up to my breast.  They\r\nwere then in flower--the flowers being of a lilac colour, and growing at\r\nthe tops of the branches in little cymes.  They had no corolla--only a\r\ncoloured calyx.  Now these characters correspond with those of the\r\ndaphne.  Besides, the leaves were lanceolate, velvety on the surface,\r\nand of purplish colour; and the flowers were of an exceedingly sweet\r\nscent--as is the case with all the daphnads.  I did not think of\r\nexamining them at the time; but, now that I recall these\r\ncharacteristics, I feel almost certain that the shrubs were of this\r\ngenus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you can find the thicket again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! yes, easily enough.  It is not very distant from the place, where\r\nwe were so near fighting that fearful duel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Caspar, in reply to the significant remark of the\r\nbotanist.  \"But, brother!\" continued he, \"suppose it should prove to be\r\nthe shrub you speak of, what good would there be in our finding it, so\r\nlong as we don't understand the process of manufacturing it into paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that we don't?\" said Karl, challenging the too positive\r\ndeclaration of Caspar.  \"I am not so sure that we don't.  I have read\r\nthe whole account of the process, as given by one of the old writers\r\nupon China.  It is very simple; and I think I remember enough to be able\r\nto follow it.  Perhaps not to make fine paper, that one might write\r\nupon; but something that would serve our purpose just as well.  We don't\r\nwant the best `cream-laid.'  Unfortunately, we have no post-office here.\r\nI wish we had.  If we can fabricate anything as fine as the coarsest\r\npacking-paper, it will do well enough for a kite, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied Caspar.  \"It would be all the better to be coarse and\r\nstrong.  But, dear Karl, suppose we go at once, and see if we can\r\ndiscover the trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just what we shall do,\" replied Karl, rising as he spoke, and\r\npreparing to set out in search of the daphne.\r\n\r\nAll, of course, went together: for Ossaroo was as much interested in the\r\nresult of the exploration as any of them; and Fritz, from within the\r\nhut, perceiving that they were about to depart upon some new expedition,\r\nmanaged partially to coax himself out of his ill-humour; and, sallying\r\nforth from his hiding-place, trotted silently after them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE PAPER-TREE.\r\n\r\nTo the great delight of the party, it turned out just as Karl had\r\nconjectured.  The thicket that he had spoken of was composed chiefly of\r\ndaphne shrubs--judging by the appearance of the fallen leaves, and some\r\nberries that still remained on the branches, Karl believed them to be of\r\nthis species.  But the bark was also a characteristic: being exceedingly\r\ntenacious, and moreover of a strongly acrid taste--so much so as to\r\ncauterise he skin of Ossaroo's mouth, who had been foolish enough to\r\nchew it too freely.\r\n\r\nAfter duly examining the leaves, berries, and bark, the botanist came to\r\nthe conclusion that the shrub must be a true daphne; and so in reality\r\nit was--that species known in Nepaul as the _Daphne Bholua_--from which,\r\nas already stated, the Nepaulese manufacture a coarse, but soft paper.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this point was determined to their satisfaction, they\r\nresolved upon carrying Caspar's hint into execution--by trying the\r\nexperiment of a paper kite.\r\n\r\nBut for Karl's practical education--which had made him acquainted not\r\nonly with the botanical characters of plants and trees, but also with\r\ntheir uses--and in some cases with the mode of using them--the mere\r\ndiscovery of the daphne would have availed them nothing.  As it stood in\r\nthe thicket, it was no more like paper than any of the trees that grew\r\naround it.  Indeed, there were many others that would have yielded bark\r\nin broader flakes than it, and much more resembling paper: for that of\r\nthe daphne, stripping off as it did in narrow pieces, looked like the\r\nlast thing in the world of which to make a kite out of.  But Karl knew\r\nthe process by which it could be metamorphosed into paper; and without\r\nfurther delay, he entered upon the performance--the others placing their\r\nservices at his disposal, and acting in obedience to his orders.\r\n\r\nThe knife-blades of all three were called into requisition; and in an\r\nincredibly short space of time, some scores of the little trees were\r\nstripped of their bark--from their roots up to the lower branches.  The\r\ntrees themselves were not cut down; as that was not necessary.  They\r\ncould be peeled more readily, as they stood; and for this reason they\r\nwere left standing.\r\n\r\nUp to the hour of sunset did these \"cascarilleros\" work--with only a few\r\nminutes of interruption, while they went back to the hut, and ate a\r\nhurried luncheon of ibex-meat--and just as the sun was sinking behind\r\nthe summit of the great Chumulari, they might have been seen trudging\r\nhomeward--each bearing a heavy bundle of bark, with Fritz following\r\ngleefully at their heels.\r\n\r\nThe thicket from which they had taken their departure, gave evidence of\r\nthe industry with which they had been working all day long.  Over a\r\nspace, of nearly half an acre in extent, the trees were seen standing,\r\neach with its tiny trunk completely divested of bark: as if a whole gang\r\nof goats had been browsing upon them!\r\n\r\nOn reaching the hovel, our bark-gatherers did not desist from their\r\nlabour.  They only entered upon a new branch of industry: by becoming\r\n_paper manufacturers_.\r\n\r\nIt was after night; and they had to work by the light of their torches\r\nof cheel-pine, already prepared.  But as these burnt with a clear steady\r\nflame, they served quite as well as candles would have done.\r\n\r\nThe first process in the paper-making did not require much nicety in its\r\nexecution; and, moreover, it could be performed as well inside the hut\r\nas in the largest room of a paper-mill.  All they had to do was to pick\r\nthe bark to shreds.  This occupied them the whole evening--during which\r\nthere was much conversation of a cheerful kind, with a joke or two about\r\noakum-picking in a prison; and of this, not only the task in which they\r\nwere engaged, but the situation in which they were executing it, did not\r\nfail to remind them.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished, they ate their frugal supper and retired to\r\nrest--full of the idea of continuing the paper manufacture in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, they had not much to do: for the next process was one\r\nwhich required the exercise of patience rather than of labour.\r\n\r\nWhen the bark of the daphne has been thoroughly picked to pieces, it is\r\nput into a large pot or cauldron filled with water.  A lixivium of\r\nwood-ashes is then thrown in along with it; and it is suffered to boil\r\nfor several hours.\r\n\r\nAs our manufacturers were without pot or cauldron of any kind, there\r\nwould have been here an interruption of an insurmountable kind: had it\r\nnot been that they had plenty of water already on the boil, and\r\nperpetually boiling--in the hot-spring near the hut.\r\n\r\nApparently all they should have to do would be, to immerse the prepared\r\nbark in the spring, and there leave it for a proper length of time.  But\r\nthen the water, where it was hottest, was constantly in motion--bubbling\r\nup and running off; so that not only would the strings of bark be\r\ncarried away, but the ashes would be separated from the mass, and\r\nconsequently of no service in aiding to macerate it.\r\n\r\nHow was this difficulty to be got over?  Easily enough.  They had not\r\nproceeded thus far without thinking of a plan; and this plan was, to\r\nplace the bark along with the ashes in one of the large yak-skins still\r\nin good preservation, and after making it up into a sort of bundle--like\r\nclothes intended for the laundry--to plunge the skin and its contents\r\ninto the spring, and there leave them--until the boiling water should\r\nperform its part.  By this ingenious contrivance, did they get over the\r\ndifficulty, of not being provided with a not.\r\n\r\nWhen Karl thought that the bark was sufficiently boiled, it was taken\r\nout of the water, and also out of its yak-skin wrapper.  It was then\r\nplaced, in mass, upon a flat rock near by--where it was left to drip and\r\nget dry.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that it was in the water--and also while it was dripping\r\nand drying on the rock--none of them were idle.  Caspar was engaged in\r\nfashioning a stout wooden mallet--a tool which would be needed in some\r\nafter operations--while Ossaroo was equally busy upon an article of a\r\nvery different kind.  This was a sort of sieve made of thin splints of\r\ncane, set in a frame of thicker pieces of the same cane--ringall bamboo.\r\n\r\nOssaroo had undertaken this special task: as none of the others knew so\r\nwell, how to fashion the bamboo into any required utensil; and although\r\nhe was now making something altogether new to him, yet, working under\r\nthe direction of Karl, he succeeded in making a sieve that was likely to\r\nserve the purpose for which plant-hunter designed it.  That purpose will\r\npresently be spoken of.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fibre was nearly dry, the mallet was brought into\r\nrequisition; and with this the mass was pounded upon the flat surface of\r\nthe rock--until it became reduced to a complete state of \"pulp.\"\r\n\r\nThis pulp was once more put into the yak-skin--which had been gathered\r\nup around the edges so as to form a sort of concavity or rude vat--and\r\nagain immersed under water--not of the boiling spring, but the cool\r\nwater of the lake--until the bag became full.  The pulp was next stirred\r\nwith a stick--which brought the coarse dirty parts to the surface.\r\nThese were skimmed off, and thrown away as refuse; and the process was\r\nrepeated with fresh water--until the whole substance, which was of a\r\nmucilaginous character, was rendered pure, and soft to the touch.  The\r\nnext and last operation was in fact the making of the paper; and was\r\nperformed by Karl himself.  It was simple enough, though requiring a\r\ncertain dexterity, or sleight of hand, to do it well.  It consisted in\r\nplacing a quantity of the pulp upon the sieve before mentioned; and\r\ncradling the frame about--all the time held under water--until the\r\nsubstance became equally and uniformly spread over the whole surface.\r\nThe sieve was then taken out of the water--being raised gently and kept\r\nin a horizontal position--so as not to derange the even stratum of pulp\r\nthat severed it.  This done, nothing more remained but to place the\r\nframe across a pair of bars, and leave the pulp to get drained and\r\neventually become dry.  When dry, it would be _paper_!\r\n\r\nOf course, with one sieve, the whole quantity required could not be made\r\nat a single cast; but, as soon as one sheet became sufficiently dry to\r\nbe taken off the frame, the sieve was again repulped; and so on, till\r\nthe whole of the boiled bark was converted into paper; and they found\r\nthemselves in possession of a sufficient number of broad sheets to make\r\na kite as big as a coach-house-door.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of their having to wait for the drying of each sheet, the\r\nprocess occupied them for several days; but during this time they had\r\nnot been either idle or inactive.  Karl and Caspar had been hard at\r\nwork, in getting up the \"bones\" of the kite; while Ossaroo had\r\nundertaken to fabricate the tail.\r\n\r\nThe rope with which it was to be \"flyed,\" occupied more time, and\r\nrequired more care, than any other portion of their work.  Every strand\r\nhad to be twisted with the greatest exactness; and almost every fibre\r\ntested, as to its strength and fitness.  Could they have used a rope of\r\nstouter build, it would not have been necessary to be so particular; but\r\na thick rope would have been too heavy for the kite to carry--just as it\r\nhad been too heavy for the strength of the eagle.  A slender cord,\r\ntherefore, like that they were obliged to make, required to be\r\nfaultless--else the life of some one of them might be sacrificed while\r\nattempting the ascent.\r\n\r\nWith a foreknowledge of this, it is hardly necessary to say that Ossaroo\r\ndid his best in the manufacture of that rope--every strand of it being\r\ntwisted between his index finger and his thumb, as smoothly and evenly\r\nas if he had been spinning it for a fishing-line.\r\n\r\nThe framework of the kite was made out of split culms of the ringall\r\nbamboo; which, on account of its strength, elasticity, and lightness,\r\nwas far superior for the purpose to any species of exogenous wood; while\r\nthe glue for laying on the paper was procured from the root of an arum--\r\ngrated, and then boiled into a glutinous starch.\r\n\r\nIn about a week after the notion of a kite had been \"hatched\" in the\r\nbrain of Caspar, the bird itself might have been seen outside the door\r\nof the hut--full-fledged and ready for flight!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nFLYING THE KITE.\r\n\r\nThe kite having been thus prepared, they only waited for an opportunity\r\nof flying it--for a day when the wind should be sufficiently strong, and\r\nblowing from the right quarter--that is, towards that portion of the\r\nprecipice over which it appeared best that the paper-bird should be\r\ndispatched.  This was the same place, where the ladders had been set,\r\nand where they had unsuccessfully endeavoured to send up the bearcoot.\r\n\r\nThey had already ascended one of the isolated cairns of rock, that stood\r\nwithin the valley nearly opposite this part of the cliff; and from its\r\ntop they had been able to get a view--though not a very good one--of a\r\nportion of the sloping declivity of the mountain above.  It appeared to\r\nbe covered with snow--here and there supporting huge masses of\r\nsomething, either boulders of rock, or dark-coloured lumps of ice.  The\r\neyes of our adventurers rested on these with the greatest interest: as\r\nthey had done upon a former occasion, when about to send the bearcoot\r\namong them.  Now they had conceived higher hopes than ever--founded upon\r\nthe presence of these masses.  If they should succeed in flying the kite\r\ninto their midst, and there dropping it, it was not only possible, but\r\nhighly probable, that it might either get the rope warped around one of\r\nthem, or itself become caught between two, so as to hold fast.  To\r\nrender this the more practicable, they had furnished its wings with\r\nspurs--in other words, they had left the cross-piece of bamboo to extend\r\non each side about a foot beyond the edge of the paper; and near the end\r\nof each extension, they had placed other pieces transversely, and lashed\r\nthem firmly--so that they might act as the flukes of an anchor.\r\n\r\nThey had spared neither pains nor ingenuity to ensure success.  They had\r\ndone all, that man could do, to deserve it.\r\n\r\nFortune was so far favourable, as not to keep them long in suspense.\r\nOnly two or three days had passed, when one came, on which the wind blew\r\nin their favour--exactly as they wanted it.  It was a stiff breeze,\r\nsteady in the right direction, and strong enough to carry up the largest\r\nof paper kites.\r\n\r\nProceeding to the place, where the ladders were set, with the huge bird\r\ncarried in the arms of Ossaroo, they made ready for its flight.  Karl\r\nwas to start the kite, and guide its ascent from the ground; while\r\nCaspar and the shikaree were to run out with the rope: as it would\r\nrequire the united strength of both to hold such a broad-breasted bird\r\nagainst the wind.  They had taken the precaution to cut away the bushes\r\nto a long distance backwards from the cliff, and so clear the track:\r\nthere was therefore nothing to impede them while paying out the string.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that Karl should have direction of the movement, and\r\ngive out the signal for them to start.\r\n\r\nIt was a moment of vivid emotion, as each of he three placed himself in\r\nthe position assigned to him--Karl by the kite, with its backbone in one\r\nhand, and its tail in the other--Ossaroo clutching the rope--and Caspar\r\nby his side, holding the great coil in readiness for delivery.\r\n\r\nKarl poised the creature upon the stump of its tail; and then, lifting\r\nwith all his strength--so as to raise it several feet from the ground--\r\nhe gave forth the signal at the highest pitch of his voice.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant, Caspar and the shikaree ran backward--tightening\r\nthe rope as they went; and like a vast vulture with outspread wings, the\r\nbird soared silently upward into the air.\r\n\r\nIt rose with a regular majestic motion, soon overtopping the trees that\r\ngrew near, and still mounting on towards the summit of the cliff.\r\n\r\nKarl cheered as he saw it ascend.  The others were too busy in the\r\nperformance of their parts to find time for this expression of triumph;\r\nand not until the kite had soared high into the heavens, and appeared\r\nmany yards above the brow of the beetling precipice, did Caspar and\r\nOssaroo respond to the cheering of Karl.  Then both together gave vent\r\nto their excited feelings in a long-continued hurrah!\r\n\r\n\"Let go now, Ossaroo!\" cried Karl, shouting so as to be heard above the\r\nwind.  \"You, Caspar, keep hold of the end of the cord.\"\r\n\r\nOssaroo, obedient to the order, suddenly slackened his hold--at the same\r\ntime springing towards Caspar, and prudently seizing the end along with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe kite, thus released, like some huge bird that had received its\r\ndeath-wound, turned head downwards towards the earth; and, after making\r\nvarious sinuous evolutions through the air, flouting its long tail first\r\nin one direction then in another--it was seen darting down towards the\r\nacclivity of the mountain.  At length, passing behind the summit of the\r\ncliffs, it was no longer visible to the eyes of those who had aided it\r\nin its lofty flight, and then left it helplessly to fall.\r\n\r\nSo far they had succeeded to the utmost of their expectations.  The kite\r\nhad alighted, just where they wanted it.\r\n\r\nBut now arose the question--would it stay there?  In other words, would\r\nit be caught among the rocks, and hold fast?\r\n\r\nIf not, they would have to fly it again and again, until it should get\r\nfastened above, or until the experiment should prove a failure.\r\n\r\nKarl stepped forward to decide the point--the others looking on with an\r\neagerness of glance, that betrayed how deep was their interest in the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nKarl's hand trembled as he laid hold of the cord.  At first he pulled\r\nupon it in a gentle way--hand over hand--so as merely to take in the\r\nslack.\r\n\r\nAt length it began to tighten, requiring greater strength to take it in:\r\nas if the kite was still free, and dragging over the snow.\r\n\r\nThis produced anything but a pleasant anticipation; and as the rope came\r\nto hand, foot after foot, and yard after yard, a shadow, that had stolen\r\nover the countenances of all three, became sensibly darker.\r\n\r\nOnly for a short while did this shadow remain.  It vanished, more\r\nsuddenly than it had arisen: when they saw the running cord become\r\nabruptly checked, and then tighten as Karl continued to draw it in.  He\r\npulled upon it, at first exerting only a part of his strength, as if\r\nafraid that it might again come loose.  After awhile, gaining\r\nconfidence, he pulled with all his power.  It still held fast!\r\n\r\nOssaroo and Caspar now joined their strength to his; and all three\r\npulled together.\r\n\r\nHurrah! the kite would not come!  The cord kept its place, stretching to\r\nthe bottom of the cliff, as taut as the main-stay of a ship!\r\n\r\nEjaculations of joy escaped from all three at the same instant of time:\r\nand for some moments they stood, tightly clutching the rope, and holding\r\nit firmly: as if in dread of its being dragged out of their grasp by\r\nsome hostile and invisible hand.\r\n\r\nAt length Karl suggested the propriety of making the cord secure, by\r\nfastening it to some object.  A large upright stone, close by the bottom\r\nof the cliff, appeared to be the most proper thing; and to this they\r\ndetermined upon tying it.\r\n\r\nStill keeping it taut--lest by slackening it they might disturb the\r\nanchor aloft--they moved hand over hand along the rope, until they had\r\ngot close to the bottom of the precipice.  Then, while Karl and Caspar\r\nstill held on, Ossaroo gathered up the slack; and, turning it several\r\ntimes round the stone, securely _belayed_ it.\r\n\r\nNothing more remained but to make the steps--which had been already\r\ndesigned--adjust them in their places--climb up to the top of the\r\ncliff--and be free as the mountain breeze, which would there be blowing\r\naround them!\r\n\r\nThe thought of such a lucky deliverance filled them once more with\r\njoyous imaginings; and they stood around the stone, to which the rope\r\nhad been attached--congratulating themselves, as if they had already\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nThey knew there would still be some time required to make the steps, and\r\nfix them in their places; but, since they no longer doubted their\r\nability to accomplish the ascent, the interval of time might be passed\r\ncheerfully enough; and, with this pleasant anticipation, they went back\r\nto their workshop in the best of spirits, and cooked themselves a more\r\ncareful dinner than they had eaten since the discovery of the daphne\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE ROPE-LADDER.\r\n\r\nIt took them another day--with their blades all busy from morning till\r\nnight--to prepare the pegs which were to constitute the \"rounds\" of\r\ntheir rope-ladder.  More than a hundred were required: as the cliff\r\nwhere the rope passed up was over a hundred yards in height; and the\r\nsteps were intended to be placed at equal distances of about two feet\r\napart.\r\n\r\nIt had been their design at first to insert the steps in the rope--\r\nbetween the strands of which it was composed; but, on reflection, a\r\nbetter plan suggested itself.  By opening the strands to let in the\r\npieces of wood, the rope might be weakened, so much as to endanger its\r\nbreaking; and this alone, above all things, was to be avoided.  It was\r\ndeemed more prudent to leave the cord untouched, and place the sticks\r\ncrosswise outside of it.  Whipped round with strong pieces of other\r\ncord, they could easily be made to keep their places--more especially\r\nas, with the hands of the climber grasping the rope above, no one stick\r\nwould have to carry the full weight of his body; and, even should one of\r\nthem slip a little out of place, there would be no great danger of an\r\naccident arising out of the circumstance.\r\n\r\nIt occupied them a second day in twining the pieces of string, required\r\nfor tying the sticks in their places; and, upon the morning of the\r\nthird, they returned to the cliff, with the intention of transforming\r\nthe cord, that the kite had carried up, into a rope-ladder.\r\n\r\nThe mode by which they intended to effect this purpose will be easily\r\nunderstood--after what has been already said respecting it.  The little\r\nsticks were to be laid transversely against the rope, and then so\r\ntightly tied in their places, as to prevent them from slipping down.\r\nThe first was to be attached about the height of a man's waist from the\r\nground; and the second on a level with his chin.  Then with the feet\r\nresting upon the first, and the left hand grasping the rope above, it\r\nwould be possible to fix another at the height of the chin, as it would\r\nthen be.  By climbing up to the second, a fourth could be placed at a\r\nlittle distance above; and thus in succession, till the top of the cliff\r\nshould be attained.\r\n\r\nIt was not supposed, that any one could continue the process of\r\nattaching the steps, till all were set in their places; nor did they\r\ncontemplate being able to complete the work in a little time.  On the\r\ncontrary, they expected it to occupy them for days; and they knew,\r\nmoreover, that long intervals of rest would be required by any one who\r\nshould have to execute it.  Standing upon such unstable footing, for any\r\nconsiderable length of time, would be both irksome and fatiguing; and\r\nthey were about to enter upon the task with a full knowledge of its\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the cord they at once set to work upon it.  Rather should it\r\nbe said, that one of them did so: for only one could work at a time in\r\nthis, the last labour, as they supposed, they would have to perform in\r\nthat lone valley.\r\n\r\nIn attaching the steps to the rope, Ossaroo was allowed to act as sole\r\noperator: since neither of the others understood the handling of cordage\r\nso well as he.  They could but act as spectators and the only purpose\r\nwhich their presence could serve, was to cheer the shikaree by their\r\ncompany and conversation.\r\n\r\nBy good fortune it was not necessary for Ossaroo to fix any steps to the\r\nfirst thirty feet of the kite cord.  One of the long ladders which they\r\nhad made enabled him to ascend that far without using the sticks; and,\r\nindeed, all of the ladders might have served in this way, had the kite\r\ncarried its cord up the cliff within reach of them.  Unfortunately, this\r\ndid not happen to be the case; and only the first ladder could be made\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nPlacing it nearly parallel with the rope, Ossaroo mounted up; and, when\r\nnear its top, commenced attaching the steps.  He had carried up along\r\nwith him about a dozen of the little sticks, with cords to correspond--\r\nin a sort of pouch, which he had formed with the skirts of his cotton\r\ntunic.\r\n\r\nKarl and Caspar below, seated upon stones, and Fritz squatted on the\r\nground, watched the movements of the shikaree with deep and speechless\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIt was not a very long time, before he had adjusted the first two pegs\r\nin their proper places; and, then letting himself off the ladder, and\r\nplacing both his feet upon the first cross-piece, in a way that they\r\nbalanced one another and kept the stick in a horizontal position--he\r\nproceeded to attach the third about the height of his chin.\r\n\r\nTo do this required, a good deal of adroitness; but Ossaroo was gifted\r\nwith this quality to a high degree; and, so far as his footing was\r\nconcerned, the Hindoo was as much at home upon a rope, as would have\r\nbeen one of those monkeys sacred to the believers in his Brahministic\r\ncreed.\r\n\r\nAny other feet would soon have become tired--resting upon such a slender\r\nsupport; but Ossaroo had been accustomed to climbing the tall lofty\r\npalms, until his toes had acquired a certain degree of prehensile power;\r\nand the smallest branch or protuberance on the trunk of a tree, or even\r\na knot on a rope, was footing enough to enable him to hold on for many\r\nminutes at a time.  He had no difficulty, therefore, in balancing\r\nhimself upon the sticks, which he had already attached; nor ascending\r\nfrom one to the other, as each was got into its place.  In this way he\r\nproceeded, until the stock which he had taken up with him was exhausted,\r\nand his apron hung empty.  Then, letting himself down from step to step,\r\nand cautiously returning to the wooden ladder, he descended to the\r\nbottom of the cliff.\r\n\r\nKarl or Caspar might have rendered his coming down unnecessary, as\r\neither could have carried so light a \"hod\" up the ladder; but there was\r\ngood reason why Ossaroo should make the descent--that was, to rest and\r\nrefresh himself.\r\n\r\nHe did not remain very long below--just long enough to let the blood\r\ncirculate along the soles of his naked feet--and then, with his apron\r\ndistended--being once more full of sticks--he reclimbed the ladder,\r\nswung himself out upon the cord, and clambered up the steps he had\r\nalready fixed in their places.\r\n\r\nHis second stock of sticks becoming exhausted as the first, he again\r\nrevisited the earth; again allowed himself an interval of rest; and then\r\nascended as before.\r\n\r\nWith Ossaroo proceeding in this fashion, the remainder of the day was\r\nspent--a long interval being allowed for dinner; which Karl and Caspar,\r\nhaving nothing else to do, had cooked with extra care.  They did not go\r\nhome to the hut to perform their culinary operations.  There would have\r\nbeen no advantage in doing so: since the kitchen accommodation there was\r\nnot a whit better than where they were at work; and the larder contained\r\nnothing more than what they had brought along with them--some dried\r\nibex-meat.  But Karl had not been idle for a portion of the time; and\r\nhad collected various roots and fruits that, when roasted, not only\r\nhelped out the meal, but rendered it sufficiently luxurious for stomachs\r\nlike theirs, no longer fastidious.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Ossaroo indulged in a long smoke of his favourite \"bang;\"\r\nand, stimulated by this, returned to his task with renewed energy.\r\n\r\nSo successful was he in its accomplishment, that, before sunset he had\r\nfull fifty steps in place; which, along with the wooden ladder, enabled\r\nhim to climb nearly a third of the way up the cliff.\r\n\r\nOf course darkness put an end to his operations for that day; and with\r\nthe intention of continuing them on the morrow, both the operator and\r\nspectators wended their way back to the hut--Karl and Caspar showing as\r\nmuch respect to Ossaroo, as if he had been the master architect, and\r\nthey only his assistants or labourers.  Even Fritz appeared to be\r\nimpressed with the belief that the shikaree was the most important\r\npersonage in the party: for every time that the latter descended from\r\nthe cliff the dog had paid his \"devoirs\" to him, frisking around,\r\nleaping up, and looking steadfastly in his face, as if congratulating\r\nhim on being their deliverer!\r\n\r\nOn the road home Fritz continued these demonstrations--springing against\r\nthe legs of the shikaree so as occasionally to impede his progress,\r\nevidently convinced--either from his own observation or from the respect\r\nwhich he saw the others were paying him--that the Hindoo was the hero of\r\nthe day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY SIX.\r\n\r\nOSSAROO MAKES A QUICK DESCENT.\r\n\r\nNext morning, as soon as they had despatched an early meal, they\r\nreturned to their work--that is, Ossaroo to work, the others to watch.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately on this day the weather was unfavourable for operations.\r\nThere was a high wind, not continuous, but blowing in short, quick\r\npuffs--gusty and violent.\r\n\r\nAs Ossaroo hung upon the rope half-way up the precipice, the wind acting\r\nupon his body, carried him at times several feet out from the face of\r\nthe cliff--causing him also to oscillate violently from side to side,\r\nnotwithstanding that the rope was fast at both ends.\r\n\r\nIt was fearful to look at him thus suspended, and swinging in mid-air.\r\nAt times the hearts of the spectators were filled with consternation,\r\nlest the brave shikaree should either have his brains dashed out against\r\nthe beetling cliff; or, being forced to let go his hold, be flung far\r\nout, and falling upon the rocks below, get crushed to atoms.\r\n\r\nOften during the earlier part of the day were the alarms of Karl and\r\nCaspar raised to such a height, that they shouted to Ossaroo to come\r\ndown; and when down, entreated him not to go up again until, by the\r\nlulling of the wind, the danger should become diminished.\r\n\r\nTheir entreaties, however, were of no avail.  The shikaree, accustomed\r\nall his life to braving the elements, felt no fear of them; but on the\r\ncontrary, seemed to feel a pride, if not an actual pleasure, in thus\r\ndaring danger.\r\n\r\nEven while swinging out from the cliff, and oscillating along its\r\n_facade_--like the pendulum of some gigantic clock--he was seen tying\r\nthe strings and adjusting the pieces of stick, as coolly, as if he had\r\nbeen standing upon _terra firma_ at the bottom!\r\n\r\nThus, nearly to the hour of noon, did Ossaroo continue his arduous\r\nundertaking--of course with the usual intervals of rest, during each of\r\nwhich Karl and Caspar reiterated their entreaties for him to desist and\r\nleave the work to be executed at a more favourable opportunity.  Fritz,\r\ntoo, while lavishing his caresses on the daring climber, seemed to look\r\npersuadingly into his face--as if he knew there was danger in what the\r\nHindoo was doing.\r\n\r\nIt was all in vain.  The shikaree, while resisting all their efforts to\r\nrestrain him, seemed to scorn the danger which they dreaded; and,\r\nwithout hesitation, returned to his perilous task.\r\n\r\nAnd no doubt he would have succeeded in accomplishing it, allowing due\r\ntime for its completion.  It was not the wind that would have shaken him\r\nfrom that rope, to which he clung with the tenacity of a spider.  Had\r\nthe support proved true, he could have held on, even though it had been\r\nblowing a hurricane!\r\n\r\nIt was not in this that his chief danger lay; nor from such source was\r\nit to come; but from one altogether unexpected and unthought-of.\r\n\r\nIt was near the hour of noon, and Ossaroo had already succeeded in\r\nsetting the steps up to about half the height of the cliff.  He had\r\ndescended for a fresh supply of sticks; and, having gone up the\r\ntree-ladder, and swung himself back upon the kite cord, was just\r\ncommencing to clamber up it--as he had already done nearly a score of\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Karl and Caspar were upon him, following his movements, as\r\nthey had been doing all along; for, despite his frequent repetition of\r\nthe ascent, it was always a perilous performance, and interesting to\r\nbehold.\r\n\r\nJust as he had got free from the ladder, and fairly out upon the rope, a\r\ncry came from his lips that thrilled the hearts of the spectators with\r\nalarm: for they knew that the utterance was one of terror.  They needed\r\nno explanation of that cry; for at the same moment that it reached their\r\nears, they perceived the danger that had caused Ossaroo to utter it.  He\r\nwas descending along the facade of the cliff--not gliding down the rope\r\nof his own free will, but as if the kite had got loose at the top, and,\r\nyielding to the weight of his body, was being dragged over the surface\r\nof the snow!\r\n\r\nAt first, he appeared to be descending only very slowly; and, but for\r\nthe cries he was putting forth, and the slackening of the rope below,\r\nthey upon the ground might not have been aware of what was going on.\r\nBut they had not regarded his movements for many seconds, before\r\nperceiving the true state of the case, and the fearful peril in which\r\ntheir faithful shikaree was now placed.\r\n\r\nBeyond doubt the kite had become detached above; and, yielding to the\r\nstrain upon the rope, caused by Ossaroo's weighty was being pulled\r\ntowards the edge of the precipice!\r\n\r\nWould the resistance be equal to the weight of the man's body?  Would it\r\nlet him down easily?  Or would the dragging anchor arrive at a place\r\nwhere the surface was smooth, and then gliding rapidly over it, increase\r\nthe velocity of the descent?  In other words, was the shikaree about to\r\nbe projected through a fall of thirty feet to the bottom of the cliff?\r\n\r\nThe spectators were left but little time to speculate on probabilities.\r\nNot a moment was allowed them to take measures for securing the safety\r\nof their companion.  Before they could recover from the surprise, with\r\nwhich his first shout had inspired them, they saw that his descent was\r\nevery moment becoming more accelerated: now in gradual declination, then\r\nin quick, short jerks--until he had got within about twenty-feet of the\r\nground.  They were in hopes that he might continue to descend in this\r\nfashion for a few yards further, and then the danger would be over; but,\r\njust at that moment, the broad breast of the kite was seen poising\r\nitself over the top of the cliff; and like a great living bird, it\r\nsprang off from the rocks, and soared out over the valley!\r\n\r\nOssaroo, still clinging to the cord, was carried some distance from the\r\ncliff; but, fortunately for him, the weight of his body overbalanced the\r\nresistance which the atmosphere offered to the broad surface of the\r\nkite; else he might have been carried much higher into the air.  Equally\r\nfortunate was it, that the amount of overbalance was exceedingly\r\nslight--otherwise he might have been dashed with violence to the earth!\r\n\r\nAs it was, he came down as gently as a dove, alighting upon his legs,\r\nand remaining erect upon them, like Mercury upon the top of his\r\n\"sky-kissing mountain.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment that the shikaree felt his feet touching _terra firma_, he\r\nsprang nimbly to one side, at the same instant letting go the rope, as\r\nif it had been a rod of red-hot iron!\r\n\r\nThe great kite, no longer held in poise against the wind, commenced\r\ndarting hither and thither; at each turn descending lower and lower--\r\nuntil by one last swoop, in which it seemed to concentrate all its\r\nfailing strength, it came down towards Ossaroo like a gigantic bird of\r\nprey descending upon its victim!\r\n\r\nIt was just as much as the shikaree could do to get out of the way; and,\r\nhad he not ducked his head in the very nick of time, he would certainly\r\nhave received a blow upon his skull, that would have endangered its\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE OF THE KITE.\r\n\r\nThe joy, which all felt at the miraculous escape of Ossaroo, more than\r\ncompensated for their chagrin at the circumstance of the kite having\r\nreturned to them: more especially, as they believed that the accident\r\nwas not without remedy.  It might be attributed to the wind: which no\r\ndoubt had lifted the kite from where it lay, detaching it from the rock,\r\nor whatever other object that had for the time entangled it.\r\n\r\nThey doubted not, but that they might again succeed in sending it up,\r\nand getting it fast as before; and this confidence hindered them from\r\ngrieving over the unfortunate occurrence, as they might otherwise have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAs the wind on that day was in the wrong quarter for flying a kite\r\ntowards the cliff, they determined to postpone the attempt, till a more\r\nfavourable opportunity; and, in order that their kite should not be in\r\ndanger of getting spoiled by the rain, they once more shouldered, and\r\ncarried it back, rope and all, to the shelter of the hut.\r\n\r\nNearly a week elapsed, before there was a breeze that blew in their\r\nfavour; but during this interval, they had not been altogether\r\nunemployed.  Still uncertain of the length of time they might be\r\ndetained in the valley, they had passed almost every hour of the\r\ndaylight in increasing their stock of provisions--so as not to encroach\r\nupon the cured venison of the ibex, of which a considerable quantity was\r\nstill to the good.\r\n\r\nTheir guns were no longer used for procuring food.  The last loads still\r\nremained in the barrels; and were not to be fired off--until every other\r\nmeans of capturing game should fail them.\r\n\r\nIndeed, they were now so confident of being able to get out of their\r\nprison, that at times they almost fancied themselves already on their\r\nway down the mountains; and talked of keeping their guns loaded, against\r\nany danger from large animals they might encounter on their homeward\r\njourney.  For procuring food they knew that firearms were not necessary.\r\nOssaroo's bow was sufficient weapon for that.  Often might it be heard\r\ntwanging among the trees; and as often did the shikaree's arrow pierce\r\nthe breast of some fine bird--a peacock, or argus pheasant, or one of\r\nthe beautiful Brahminy geese that frequented the waters of the lake.\r\n\r\nOssaroo's nets and lines, too, were not without their use.  Fish were\r\ncaught of various kinds, and excellent quality; and there was one sort\r\nin particular, should all else fail, that promised to furnish them with\r\nan inexhaustible supply.  This was a large species of eel, in which the\r\nlake abounded, to such an extent, that it was only necessary to cast in\r\na hook, with a worm upon it, and an eel of nearly six feet in length\r\nwould be instantly landed.\r\n\r\nAs they did not always relish to dine upon eels, but little of their\r\ntime was spent in procuring them.  For all that, they were gratified on\r\ndiscovering the abundance of these slippery creatures--knowing that,\r\nshould other resources fail, they would find in them a staple article of\r\nwholesome food, that could never become scarce, no matter how much they\r\nshould eat of it.\r\n\r\nA favourable wind at length came on to blow; and the kite was once more\r\nshouldered, and carried to the same place as before.  Just in the same\r\nway did they proceed to fly it; and in the same style it again rose\r\nsoaring above the cliff; and--the cord having been suddenly slacked--\r\nsank to rest upon the slope of the mountain.\r\n\r\nSo far were they once more successful; but alas! it proved to be just so\r\nfar and no farther.\r\n\r\nPulling upon the rope, to ascertain whether their anchor had \"bit,\" they\r\nwere chagrined to receive an answer in the negative.  The cord came back\r\nto them with scarce any resistance; or only such, as was caused by\r\nfriction over the edge of the cliff, and by the drag of the kite itself\r\nalong the snowy surface.\r\n\r\nHand over hand, they drew it back: foot by foot, and yard by yard, it\r\ncame yieldingly towards them--until they saw the broad curving breast of\r\nthe pseudo-bird projecting over the parapet edge of the precipice!\r\n\r\nOnce more was it launched out into the air; once more was rope given it,\r\ntill it had ascended to the full length of its tether; and once more was\r\nit allowed to alight.\r\n\r\nAgain the pull downward and inward--again the cord came freely to hand--\r\nand again was the rounded bow seen upon the brow of the precipice, and\r\noutlined against the blue sky above; not like the beautiful bow of the\r\niris--a thing of promise--but one of disappointment and chagrin.\r\n\r\nAgain the flight--again the failure--again and again; until the patience\r\nof the operators--to say nothing of their strength--was well nigh\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nBut it was no mere play for the sake of pastime.  They were not flying\r\nthat kite for their amusement; nor yet for the purpose of making some\r\nscientific experiment.  They were flying it as a means of obtaining\r\ntheir personal liberty; and they were all of them interested in the\r\nsuccess or failure of the attempt--almost as much as if their lives\r\nrested on the issue.\r\n\r\nHowever tried their strength, or worn out their patience, it would not\r\ndo to give up; and therefore--although at each unsuccessful effort, with\r\nhopes constantly becoming diminished--they continued their exertions.\r\n\r\nFor more than a score of times they had sent up the kite, and as often\r\ndragged it back to the brow of the cliff; not always at the same point:\r\nfor they had themselves changed their ground, and tried the flight in\r\ndifferent places.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the result was the same.  The bird refused to take hold\r\nwith its claws--either on rocks, or blocks of ice, or banks of frozen\r\nsnow--all of which lay scatter over the slope of the mountain.\r\n\r\nConsidering that it had caught hold on the very first trial, so many\r\nfailures were regarded by our adventurers with some surprise.  Had it\r\nnever held, there would have been no cause for this; and after so many\r\nattempts, they would have been the more inclined to yield up their plan,\r\ndeeming it impracticable.  But the fact of their first success sustained\r\nthem in the hope that success might again be obtained; and, in this\r\nbelief, they were encouraged to \"keep on trying.\"\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen additional flights were made, but fortune still declining\r\nto favour them, they desisted from their efforts, leaving the paper-bird\r\nwith its breast protruding over the cliff: as if perched there in\r\npreparation for a further flight.\r\n\r\nBy this time the kite had become sadly damaged--its _plumage_ having\r\nreceived rough usage by constant trailing over the rocks and sharp\r\nangles of ice.  While up in the air, daylight could be seen shining\r\nthrough it in several places; and it no longer exhibited that majesty of\r\nflight that had originally characterised it.  It was evident that\r\nrepairs would soon be needed; and to discuss this question, as also to\r\nconsider the propriety of proceeding to make trial at some other place,\r\nour adventurers, for a time, discontinued their efforts.\r\n\r\nAll three were standing together, but at several paces distant from the\r\nend of the rope; which they had for the moment abandoned, and which lay\r\nnegligently along the ground.\r\n\r\nThey had not taken the slightest precaution to secure it: for it had not\r\noccurred to them that there was any risk in leaving it loose.\r\n\r\nIt was only when too late, that they perceived the mistake they had\r\ncommitted--only when they saw the cord suddenly jerked up from the\r\nground, as if some invisible hand was lifting it aloft into the sky!\r\n\r\nAll three rushed towards it at the same instant.  They were too late.\r\nAlready the end of the rope was dangling at such a height above their\r\nheads, that even the tallest of them could not touch it with the tips of\r\nhis fingers.\r\n\r\nOssaroo leaped high into the air in an endeavour to clutch the string.\r\nCaspar ran to procure a pole which lay near, in hopes of retaining it in\r\nthat way: while Karl ran up the ladder that was resting against the\r\ncliff, near which the rope was yet trailing.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of all three were alike vain.  For a second or two, the end\r\nof the cord hung oscillating above their heads--just sufficiently out of\r\nreach to tantalise them; and then, as if the invisible hand above had\r\ngiven it another gigantic jerk, it was drawn rapidly and vertically\r\nupward, till it finally disappeared over the crest of the cliff!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nNO MORE PAPER-TREES!\r\n\r\nThere was nothing mysterious in the disappearance of the cord.  The kite\r\nwas no longer visible on the summit of the cliff.  The wind had carried\r\nit away; and, of course, its rope along with it.\r\n\r\nWhen the first moment of surprise had passed, our adventurers turned\r\ntowards each other with glances that spoke something more than\r\ndisappointment.  Notwithstanding the number of times that the kite had\r\nfailed to fix itself, still it had once taken a fast hold, and it was\r\nbut reasonable to suppose it would have done so again.  Besides, there\r\nwere other places where the precipice was as low, and even lower, than\r\nwhere they had made the trials; and at some of these they might have\r\nbeen more successful.  Indeed, there was every probability that, had\r\nthey not lost that kite, they would have been able in due time to have\r\nclimbed out of their rock-bound prison by a ladder of rope; but now all\r\nchance of doing so was gone for ever--swept off by a single puff of\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nYou may be fancying, that the misfortune was not irremediable.  Another\r\nkite, you will be saying, might be constructed out of similar materials\r\nas those used in making the one carried away.  But to say this, would be\r\nto speak without a full knowledge of the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe same thought had already passed through the minds of our\r\nadventurers, when they perceived that the kite they were flying was\r\ngetting torn and otherwise damaged.\r\n\r\n\"We can easily make another,\" suggested Caspar at that crisis.\r\n\r\n\"No, brother,\" was the answer of Karl; \"never another, I fear.  We have\r\npaper enough left to patch this one; but not enough to make another.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can make more paper, can we not?\" urged Caspar, interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" again replied Karl, with a negative shake of the head, \"no more--\r\nnot another sheet!\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?  Do you think there are no more daphne trees?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there are not.  You remember we stripped all there were in the\r\nthicket; and since then, thinking we might need more bark, I have gone\r\nall through the valley, and explored it in every direction, without\r\nmeeting with a single shrub of the daphne.  I am almost certain there\r\nare none.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation between the brothers had occurred, long before the\r\nlosing of the kite.  When that event came to pass, it was not necessary\r\nfor them to repeat it; and, both being thus acquainted with the fact\r\nthat it was impossible for them to construct another, they felt that\r\nthey had sustained an irreparable loss.\r\n\r\nIn what direction had the kite been carried off?  Might it not be blown\r\nalong the line of cliffs, and tossed back again into the valley?\r\n\r\nAs there appeared some probability that such a chance might arise, all\r\nthree ran outward from the rocks--in order to command a better view of\r\nthe precipice, on each side.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they stood watching--in hopes that they might see the\r\ngreat paper-bird returning to the scene of its nativity.  But it never\r\ncame back; and they became at length convinced, that it never would.\r\nIndeed, the direction of the wind--when they paused to consider it--\r\nrendered the thing not only improbable, but impossible.  It was blowing\r\n_from_ the cliffs, and _towards_ the snowy ridge.  No doubt the kite had\r\nbeen carried up the sloping acclivity; and had either passed clear over\r\nthe mountains, or become lodged in some deep defile, where the wind\r\ncould no longer reach it.  At all events, it was certain, that both kite\r\nand cord were lost to them for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Ach! how very unfortunate!\" exclaimed Caspar, in a vexed tone, when\r\nthey had finally arrived at this conviction.  \"What ill-starred luck we\r\nhave, to be sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! brother,\" remarked Karl, in a tone of reproval; \"do not chide\r\nFortune for what has happened just now.  I acknowledge it is a great\r\nmisfortune; but it is one for which we may justly blame ourselves, and\r\nonly ourselves.  By sheer negligence we have lost the kite, and along\r\nwith it, perhaps, the last chance of regaining our liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you speak truly,\" rejoined Caspar, in a tone of mingled regret and\r\nresignation.  \"It _was_ our fault, and we must suffer for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you quite sure, brother Karl,\" resumed he, after a pause, and\r\nreferring to the conversation that had already passed between them--\"are\r\nyou quite sure there are no more of these paper-bearing trees?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" replied the plant-hunter, \"I am not positive--though I fear\r\nit is as I have said--that there are no more.  It will be easy for us to\r\ndetermine the point, by making a complete exploration of the valley.  It\r\nmay be that something else might turn up which would answer the purpose\r\nequally as well.  There is a birch-tree indigenous to the Himalaya\r\nmountains, found both in Nepaul and Thibet.  Its bark can be stripped\r\noff in broad flakes and layers, to the number of eight or ten--each\r\nalmost as thin as common paper, and suitable for many purposes to which\r\npaper is usually applied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it would do for a kite?\" inquired Caspar, without waiting\r\nfor Karl to finish his explanation.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it,\" replied the botanist.  \"It would serve even better\r\nthan the daphne paper; and had I believed there was a chance of finding\r\nit here, I should have preferred it to that.  But I do not think we\r\nshall find it.  I have observed no species of birch; and I know that\r\nthis one, like most of the _Betulaceae_, affects a much colder climate\r\nthan there is in this valley.  Likely enough, it grows on the mountains\r\nabove; but there it is out of our reach.  Could we reach it there, we\r\nshould not need to be robbing it of its manifold envelope.  But let us\r\nnot despair,\" added Karl, endeavouring to appear cheerful; \"perhaps it\r\nmay be found growing down here; or, if not, we may still find another\r\ngrove of the daphne trees.  Let us proceed on and search!\"\r\n\r\nKarl was far from being sanguine in either conjecture; and it was as\r\nwell for him that he was not: for after a minute and careful exploration\r\nof the valley--which occupied nearly three whole days--neither the\r\nwished-for birch, nor the desired daphne trees--nor any other material\r\nout of which a kite might be manufactured--rewarded their search.\r\n\r\nIt was of no use, therefore, to think any longer of a kite; and the\r\nsubject was at length dismissed from their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY NINE.\r\n\r\nAEROSTATICS.\r\n\r\nIt is scarce possible to talk of a paper kite, without thinking of that\r\nother and greater aerostatic contrivance--a balloon.\r\n\r\nKarl had thought of it, long before this time; and so had Caspar, just\r\nas long: for the kite had suggested it simultaneously to the minds of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why they had not entertained the thought, and\r\nendeavoured to carry it into practical effect: since a balloon would\r\nhave been far more likely to have delivered them out of their \"mountain\r\nprison\" than a paper kite?\r\n\r\nBut they _had_ entertained the thought--at least, Karl had done so--and\r\nexamined it in all its bearings.  Caspar had permitted it to pass out of\r\nhis mind, under the impression that _they could not make a balloon_; and\r\nKarl had arrived at the same conclusion; but only from a belief that\r\nthey _had not the materials_ with which to make one.  Given the\r\nmaterials, Karl felt quite equal to the construction of a balloon--a\r\nrude one, it is true; but one which might have served the purpose for\r\nwhich they required it.\r\n\r\nDuring the days when they had been occupied in making the paper-bird, he\r\nhad given his thoughts a good deal to this subject; for, to say the\r\ntruth, he had never been very sanguine about the success of the kite\r\nexperiment.  He had pondered long and patiently on the subject of\r\nballoons--endeavouring to recall to mind what little he had studied of\r\naerostatics--and had mentally examined all the material objects within\r\nreach, in the hope of discovering some substance out of which one might\r\nbe constructed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he had not been able to think of anything that appeared\r\nto be suitable.  The daphne paper--even had it been in abundance--would\r\nnot do: for paper of itself, however close in texture, is not strong\r\nenough to withstand the pressure of the outside air--that is, in a\r\nballoon of sufficient size to carry any considerable weight.  But it was\r\nof no use to talk of paper: since there was not enough; and Karl had\r\ngiven over thinking of a balloon: because there was nothing within reach\r\nlikely to serve for its construction.\r\n\r\nHe knew that that great sphere would require to be air-proof.  He had\r\nthought of the skins of animals; but such of these as might have been\r\nobtained in sufficient quantity, were entirely too thick and heavy to\r\nmake the covering of a balloon.  The hemp, of which there _was_ an\r\nabundance, might be woven into a cloth, and then coated over by gum\r\nobtained from some tree; for in the valley were several species of\r\ngum-exuding trees.  But the question was, could they manufacture a cloth\r\nout of hemp that would be light enough when thus coated over?  It was\r\nvery doubtful whether they could--at all events they would have to\r\npractise the weaving trade for a long time, before they should arrive at\r\na sufficient expertness to accomplish such a feat.  The plan was too\r\nunpromising to be seriously entertained; and Karl had dismissed it,\r\nalong with the whole subject of the balloon.\r\n\r\nThat had been previous to the experiment of the kite, and its\r\nunfortunate ending.  But now that all hope from this quarter had been\r\nbrought to an end, the balloon once more began to shape itself in his\r\nmind, as well as in that of Caspar; and for the first time they\r\nproceeded to talk over the subject together.\r\n\r\n\"Cords we could have in plenty,\" remarked Caspar, \"but they'd be of no\r\nuse, without the stuff to cover the great globe.  They make it of silk,\r\ndon't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Karl, \"silk is the best material for the purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\" inquired Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"Because it combines the three properties of lightness, strength, and\r\ncloseness of texture, in a greater degree than any other known\r\nsubstance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would nothing else do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; many things would answer to make a balloon, that might carry\r\nup a certain amount of weight.  Even a paper balloon can be constructed\r\nto take up a few pounds--a cat, or a small dog; and people in many\r\ncountries have been cruel enough to dispatch such creatures into the\r\nair, not caring what became of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very cruel indeed!\" assented Caspar, who, although a hunter, was far\r\nfrom having an unfeeling heart.  \"Such people should be sent up\r\nthemselves in paper balloons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if paper balloons would carry them; which, unfortunately for us,\r\nthey wouldn't.  Even if we had an unlimited supply of paper, it would be\r\nof no use to us.  We require something stronger, and more tenacious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we not think of something?  Let us try, Karl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! dear brother, I have been trying for days, and in vain.  There is\r\nnothing within this valley at all suitable for the purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would canvas do?  Have you thought of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.  It would be too coarse and heavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, with great pains, could we not make it light enough?  We might\r\nchoose the finer fibres of the hemp; and spin and weave it with\r\nscrupulous care.  Ossaroo here is a perfect Omphale in his way.  I'll\r\nwarrant he could beat Hercules with the distaff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! brother!\" exclaimed Karl, a little astonished.  \"You are quite\r\nclassical in your speech this morning.  Where learnt you the history of\r\nHercules--you who have never seen the inside of a university?\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, brother Karl, that you yourself have been my instructor in\r\nthese classical themes, as you call them.  Though I must tell you that,\r\nwith the exception of their occasionally lending a little ornament to my\r\nspeech, I have derived not the slightest advantage from them; nor is it\r\nlikely I ever shall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Caspar,\" answered the botanist, \"I am not going to stand up for\r\nthe classics, as you are well aware.  Although I have taught you a\r\nlittle of their lore, it was when I had nothing to do, and you were\r\nequally idle; otherwise I should have considered that both of us were\r\nwasting time.  You already know my opinions on that subject--which are:\r\nthat a knowledge of what is usually termed `the classics' is of about as\r\nmuch use to a reasoning man as might be an equally profound knowledge of\r\nChinese _mnemonics_.  The time I have spent in the study of the _dead_\r\nlanguages has been sheer waste; and all I have learnt wont raise us a\r\nfoot higher here.  My knowledge of Jupiter and Juno is not likely to\r\ngain us the means of getting out of our difficulty, no more than my\r\nacquaintance with Mercury will help me to a pair of wings.  So a truce\r\nto classical ideas, and let us see whether scientific ones may not serve\r\nus better just now.  You have a quick invention, brother Caspar; can you\r\nthink of anything--I mean anything within our reach--that would make the\r\nair-bag of a balloon?\"\r\n\r\n\"But could you make the balloon, if you had the stuff?\" inquired Caspar,\r\nstill in doubt whether any other than an experienced aeronaut could\r\nconstruct so wonderful a machine.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" replied the philosopher, \"the making of a balloon is almost as\r\neasy as making a soap-bubble.  Any air-tight bag, filled with heated\r\natmosphere, becomes a balloon.  The question is, what weight it can be\r\nmade to carry--including the materials out of which it may be\r\nconstructed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are you to get the heated air into it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply by making a fire under an aperture left open below.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would not this air soon become cold again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and then the balloon would sink back to the earth from the air\r\ninside getting cooled, and becoming as heavy as that without.  Of\r\ncourse,\" continued the philosopher, \"you are aware that heated air is\r\nmuch lighter than the ordinary atmosphere; and that is why a balloon\r\nfilled with the former, rises, and will continue rising, till it has\r\nreached that elevation, where the rarefied atmosphere is as light as the\r\nheated air.  Then it can go no further, and the weight of the balloon\r\nitself will bring it down again.  A bladder of ordinary air sunk in\r\nwater, or a corked bottle, will illustrate this point to your\r\ncomprehension.\"\r\n\r\n\"I comprehend it well enough,\" rejoined Karl, rather piqued at being\r\ntreated too much _a l'enfant_ by his learned brother.  \"But I thought\r\nthat, in a balloon, it was necessary to keep a fire constantly burning--\r\na sort of grate or fire-basket suspended below.  Now, even if we had the\r\nsilk to make the great spherical bag, how could we make a fire-basket\r\nwithout iron?\"\r\n\r\n\"We should not need the fire-basket you speak of.  That is only\r\nrequired, when you design to keep your balloon some length of time in\r\nthe air.  If you only wish to make a short ascent, once filling the bag\r\nwith hot air is sufficient; as it would be for us here.  Even if we\r\nwanted a suspended grate, surely, brother, you have enough ingenuity to\r\nget over such a trifling difficulty as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not so sure that I could.  How would you get over it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, by making a common basket, and lining it with clay.  That would\r\ncarry fire, as well as a vessel of either cast or wrought iron--at least\r\nsufficient to serve for a short excursion such as we should care to\r\nmake.  Now-a-days, fire is not used for inflating balloons.  Inflammable\r\ngas has been found to be far superior for this purpose; but as we have\r\nno such thing in stock, we should have to proceed on the old original\r\nplan--that employed by the brothers Montgolfier--the first inventors of\r\nthe balloon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think, then, that the fire apparatus could be dispensed with, if we\r\ncould only discover some material that would make the great globe-shaped\r\nbag to contain the heated air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" replied Karl; \"think of something to do that, and I promise to\r\nmake you a balloon.\"\r\n\r\nThus challenged, Caspar set his wits to work; and for a long while he\r\nsat in silence, as if buried in some very profound speculation.\r\nProbably, there was no material substance in that valley that did not\r\npass in review before the retina of his mental vision; and all were\r\nconsidered in turn.\r\n\r\n\"It must be light, air-tight, and strong?\" asked he, at length, as if\r\nthere was something in his thoughts possessing these three requisites.\r\n\r\n\"Light, air-tight, and strong,\" answered Karl, simply repeating his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"The two last I am sure of,\" rejoined Caspar.  \"Of the first only have I\r\nmy doubts.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Karl, in a tone that betrayed his interest in what\r\nCaspar had said.\r\n\r\n\"Eel-skins!\" was the laconic answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY.\r\n\r\nTHE SKIN BALLOON.\r\n\r\n\"Eel-skins,\" said Caspar, repeating the phrase, as he saw that Karl\r\nhesitated before pronouncing an opinion.  \"Don't you think they would\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\nKarl had it on the tip of his tongue to cry out--\"The very thing!\" but\r\nsomething withheld him from making this unqualified declaration.\r\n\r\n\"They might--it is possible they might,\" said he, apparently debating\r\nthe question within himself--\"just possible; and yet I fear--\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you fear?\" asked Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think they would not be strong enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Strong enough,\" replied Karl.  \"That's not what I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"The air can't pass through an eel-skin?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not that.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the seams, perhaps?  We can stitch them neatly; and then gum them\r\nover at the joinings.  I'll warrant Ossaroo can sew like a shoemaker.\"\r\n\r\nThe shikaree could do all that.  Karl knew it.  It was not there the\r\ndifficulty lay.\r\n\r\n\"The weight, then?\" pursued Caspar interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely that,\" answered Karl; \"I fear they will be too heavy.  Bring\r\none, Ossaroo; and let us have a look at it.\"\r\n\r\nThe shikaree rose from his seat; and going into the hovel, returned\r\npresently--bringing back with him a long shrivelled object, which any\r\none could tell to be a dried eel-skin.\r\n\r\nThere were many like it inside: for they had carefully preserved the\r\nskins of the eels they had caught, induced to do so by a sort of\r\npresentiment, that some day they might find a use for them.  In this\r\ncase their prudent providence was likely to prove of service to them.\r\n\r\nKarl took the skin; and, holding it out on the palm of his hand,\r\nappeared to make an estimate of its weight.  Caspar watched his\r\nbrother's countenance, and waited to hear what he would say; but Karl\r\nonly expressed himself by a doubtful shake of the head, which seemed to\r\nshow that his opinion was _against_ the eel-skins.\r\n\r\n\"They might be made much lighter, I fancy,\" suggested Caspar: \"scraping\r\nwould do a deal for them; and by the way, why would not boiling make\r\nthem light enough?  It would take all the fatty, oily substance out of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's something in what you say,\" rejoined Karl, apparently impressed\r\nby the last suggestion.  \"Boiling might render them a good deal lighter.\r\nWe can easily try it.\"\r\n\r\nAs Karl said this, he proceeded to the boiling spring, and plunged the\r\neel-skin under the water.  There it was permitted to remain for about\r\nhalf an hour, when it was taken out; and, after being scraped with the\r\nblade of a knife, was spread upon a rock, under the sun, where it would\r\nsoon get thoroughly dry.\r\n\r\nThey all waited patiently for the completion of this process.  The\r\nresult was of too interesting a character to allow of their occupying\r\nthemselves with anything else.\r\n\r\nIn due time the eel-skin had become sufficiently dry, to be submitted to\r\nexamination; and Karl, once more taking it up, balanced it upon his\r\npalm.\r\n\r\nTested, even in this inexact fashion, it was evidently much lighter than\r\nbefore; and, by the gratified look with which the philosopher regarded\r\nit, he appeared to be much better satisfied with its weight.  Still,\r\nhowever, he was not sanguine: as his words testified.  They were almost\r\na repetition of what he had said before.\r\n\r\n\"It may do--it is just possible.  At all events, there can be no harm in\r\ntrying.  Let us try it, then.\"\r\n\r\nTo say, \"Let us try it,\" meant the same as to say, \"Let us make the\r\nballoon.\"  The others understood that; and of course acquiesced in the\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing to interfere with the immediate commencement of the\r\nwork, they resolved to set about it at once; and in fact did set about\r\nit without farther delay.\r\n\r\nThe number of eel-skins on hand, though very considerable, would not be\r\nnear enough for covering a balloon; and therefore Ossaroo went to work\r\nwith his hooks and lines to catch a few hundreds more.  Karl was able to\r\ntell how many it would take; or he could at least make an estimate\r\nsufficiently exact for the purpose.  He designed a balloon of twelve\r\nfeet diameter: for he knew that one of less size would not have power\r\nenough to carry up the weight of a man.  Of course, Karl knew how to\r\ncalculate the surface of a sphere whose diameter should be twelve feet.\r\nHe had only to multiply the diameter on the circumference; or the square\r\nof the diameter on the fixed number 3.1416; or find the convex surface\r\nof the circumscribing cylinder; or else find four times the area of a\r\ngreat circle of the said sphere.  Any one of these methods would give\r\nhim the correct result.\r\n\r\nOn making the calculation, he found that a sphere of 12 feet diameter\r\nwould have a surface of 452 square feet, within a trifling fraction.\r\nTherefore 452 square feet of eel-skins would be required to cover it.\r\nIn other words, that quantity would be required to make the balloon.\r\n\r\nAs the eels happened to be of large size--most of them being over a yard\r\nin length, and full four inches in average girth--the skin of one when\r\nspread out would yield about a square foot of surface.  Taking large and\r\nsmall together--and allowing for waste, the heads and tails that would\r\nhave to be chopped off--Karl calculated that he would get nearly a\r\nsquare foot each out of the eels; and that about five hundred skins\r\nwould make the balloon bag.  But as they would have to be cut\r\noccasionally with a slant, in order to get the globe shape, perhaps a\r\nfew more would be needed; and therefore Ossaroo was to keep his baits in\r\nthe water, until the requisite number of eels should be hooked out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOssaroo had another department assigned to him besides catching the\r\nfish; and one that took up more of his time: since the baiting of the\r\nhooks, and looking after them, required only his occasional attention.\r\nSpinning the thread by which the skins were to be sewed together, was a\r\nmuch more delicate operation: since in these both strength and fineness\r\nwere absolutely necessary.  But as Caspar had said, Ossaroo was an adept\r\nwith the distaff; and several large skeins of the finest twist were soon\r\nturned off from his nimble fingers.\r\n\r\nWhen enough thread had been thus produced, Ossaroo proceeded to making\r\nthe cords and stronger ropes, that would be needed for attaching the\r\n\"boat\"--as well as to hold the balloon in its place, while being got\r\nready for its ascent.\r\n\r\nCaspar's employment was--first, the skinning of the eels; and afterwards\r\nthe scraping, boiling, and drying of the skins; while Karl, who acted as\r\nengineer-in-chief, besides giving a general superintendence to the work,\r\noccupied himself in imparting the final dressing to the material, and\r\ncutting it into such shapes, that it could be closely and conveniently\r\nstitched together.\r\n\r\nKarl had also made an excursion into the forest, and brought back with\r\nhim large quantities of a gum, which he had extracted from a tree of the\r\ngenus _ficus_--a sort of _caoutchouc_--which is yielded by many species\r\nof _ficus_ in the forests of the Lower Himalayas.  Karl had gone in\r\nsearch of this substance, because he knew it would be required for\r\npaying the seams, and rendering them air-tight.\r\n\r\nWhen they had pursued their various avocations for about a week, it was\r\nthought that material enough of every kind was collected and made ready;\r\nand then Ossaroo was set to stitching.  Fortunately, they were provided\r\nwith needles: for these had formed a part of the _accoutrement_ of the\r\nplant-hunters--when originally starting upon their expedition.\r\n\r\nAs neither Karl nor Caspar had any experience in handling such sharp\r\ntools, the sewing had all to be done by Ossaroo; and it took another\r\nfull week to accomplish this Sartorean task.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that time, it was fully accomplished and complete; and the\r\nhuge bag was ready to receive its coat of gum varnish.  A day sufficed\r\nfor \"paying;\" and nothing more remained but to attach the \"boat,\" or\r\n\"car,\" that was to carry them aloft in their daring flight into the\r\n\"azure fields of air.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY ONE.\r\n\r\nMAKING READY FOR THE ASCENT.\r\n\r\nKarl was the only one of the three who knew anything about a balloon, or\r\nthe mode of inflating it.  Had it been their intention of navigating the\r\nair, an apparatus would have been required to carry up a fire.  This\r\nKarl could easily have contrived.  A basket of wicker-work, as he had\r\nsaid, well lined with clay, would have answered the purpose after a\r\nfashion; but as they did not intend to use the balloon for any purpose\r\nbeyond making the single ascent to lift them over the cliffs, a\r\ncontinuous fire would not be required.  The first inflation would answer\r\nthat end well enough; and therefore a grate or fire-basket was not\r\nthought of.\r\n\r\nThe car to carry the passengers--or boat, as it is sometimes styled:\r\nsince, for reasons easily understood, it is usually a boat--was quite\r\nanother affair; and had it been designed for more than a mere temporary\r\nuse, would have taken a considerable time in the making; but for what\r\nthey wanted almost anything would serve; and all that they intended\r\nemploying was a sort of wicker basket, or deep hamper, suspended by\r\nstout ropes.  This had been already prepared; and only needed to be\r\nattached to the bottom of the air-bag.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the \"bottom of the bag\" is quite a figure of\r\nspeech--_lucus a non lucendo_.  Strictly speaking, it had no bottom;\r\nbut, where this should have been, there was a round aperture, formed by\r\na stout hoop of ringall bamboo, to which the skin covering was lashed,\r\nand to which, also, the cords intended to sustain the afore-mentioned\r\nbasket, as also the stay-ropes, were to be attached.\r\n\r\nThe object of this aperture will be easily understood.  It was by it\r\nthat the hot air was to be admitted inside the balloon, for the purpose\r\nof inflating it.\r\n\r\nAnd how was this hot air to be obtained?  That was a question which Karl\r\nalone could answer.  Of course, fire was to be the agent for producing\r\nit: but how was it to be got into the bag?  Karl could tell that, and\r\nKarl only; and, now that the time had arrived for trying the experiment,\r\nhe condescended to explain to his coadjutors how he meant to proceed.\r\n\r\nThe bag was to be propped up between tall stakes set in the ground; its\r\nbottomless bottom turned towards the earth, so that the aperture would\r\nbe below.  Under this a fire was to be kindled--not, however, until\r\neverything else should be ready; and the hot air rising up into the\r\naperture would enter the balloon, and cause it to swell out to its full\r\nglobular dimensions.  More hot air being admitted, the cooler atmosphere\r\nwithin would be expelled, the balloon would become lighter than the\r\nsurrounding air, and by the simple principle of atmospheric pressure it\r\nwould ascend into the air.  It was expected it would do so--it was hoped\r\nit would.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, the hopes of the engineer were far from being high--\r\nhis expectations anything but sanguine.  He had observed all along,\r\nthat, notwithstanding the process employed for lightening the eel-skins,\r\nthey were still far heavier than silk; and perhaps, after all, the\r\nexperiment might not succeed.  There was another circumstance that had\r\nas much _weight_ on the mind of Karl as the eel-skins; and that was\r\nquite as likely to have a _bearing_ upon the balloon.  He had not\r\noverlooked the fact, that the spot, from which they proposed making the\r\nascent, was nearly ten thousand feet above the level of the sea.  He\r\nknew that the atmosphere in such a situation would be extremely\r\nrarefied, and that a balloon, which might easily ascend many thousand\r\nfeet into the air starting from the level of the sea, would not stir\r\nfrom the ground if carried to the top of a mountain ten thousand feet\r\nhigh.  This was the circumstance which preyed upon the spirit of the\r\nyoung philosopher, and hindered him from entertaining any very sanguine\r\nhopes of success in the experiment they were making.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical truth had been before his mind from the first, and at\r\ntimes had almost determined him to abandon the project.  But as he was\r\nnot sufficiently acquainted with the laws of aerostation as to be\r\ncertain of failure, he had worked on with the determination to seek\r\nsuccess, though it must be acknowledged with but faint hopes of finding\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThus stood matters on the morning when it was finally arranged to launch\r\ntheir great aerial ship, and ascertain whether it would swim.\r\n\r\nAll things were made ready at an early hour.  The huge bag was set up\r\nbetween the supporting stakes the _car_ was attached to it, as also\r\nseveral ropes to keep the balloon from being carried away; and these\r\nwere fastened at their other ends to stout pegs, driven firmly into the\r\nground; while a little furnace of stones was built underneath to hold\r\nthe fire, whose ascending caloric was to expand the balloon, and raise\r\nit into the air.\r\n\r\nThe fuel out of which this fire was to be made had been already\r\ncollected near the spot.  It was not wood, nor faggots of any kind; for\r\nalthough these might have served after a fashion, Karl was acquainted\r\nwith a better material.  He remembered that the Montgolfiers, and other\r\nearly aerostats--previous to the introduction of the inflammable gas--\r\nhad used chopped straw and wool, and regarded these materials to be the\r\nbest substances for inflating their balloons.  Karl had adopted their\r\nidea; and had provided chopped grass as a substitute for the chopped\r\nstraw, and in lieu of sheep's wool he had procured a quantity of the\r\n_poshm_ of the ibex, and other animals, that had been killed--the rich\r\nshawl-wool of Cashmere!\r\n\r\nThe car, which has already been described as a sort of deep hamper, was\r\nnot over three feet in diameter.  It was evidently not equal to the\r\nholding of three persons--to say nothing of a large dog--for it is\r\nhardly necessary to say that Fritz was not going to be left behind.  The\r\nfaithful creature had too long followed the fortunes of our adventurers\r\nto be abandoned by them now.\r\n\r\nBut there was not the slightest danger of that.  The dimensions of the\r\ncar were large enough for what the \"vehicle\" was intended to carry,\r\nwhich was only _one_.\r\n\r\nKarl believed that there would be little chance of the balloon having\r\nsufficient power to take up all three of them, their united weight being\r\nover four hundred pounds.  He would be but too contented if one should\r\nbe carried aloft; and if that one should succeed in effecting a landing\r\non the summit of the cliff, it was of no importance what afterwards\r\nbecame of the aerial ship.  Having completed that one voyage, it might\r\nmake another on its own account--either south to Calcutta or eastward to\r\nHong Kong, if it liked China better.\r\n\r\nOf course, if any one of them should succeed in surmounting the cliff,\r\nit would be an easy matter to get over the mountain; and as they had\r\npassed native villages on their way upward, these could be reached in a\r\nday or two, and a party of men, with a proper rope-ladder, brought to\r\nthe rescue of the others.\r\n\r\nEven had there been no prospect of assistance from any one outside, it\r\nwould not matter very much.  If only one of them could get to the top of\r\nthe cliffs, they could construct a rope-ladder of themselves--by which\r\nthe other two would be able to make the ascent.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say who was to make the attempt--Ossaroo was\r\nto be the aeronaut.  Ossaroo had voluntarily offered himself for this\r\nperilous performance; and his offer had been accepted.\r\n\r\nNot that either of the others were at all afraid to have run the risk.\r\nIt was from no desire to shirk the danger that they had appointed\r\nOssaroo to undertake it; but simply because, once outside, the shikaree\r\nwould be far better able to find his way down the mountains: and in his\r\nnative language could readily communicate with the villagers, and give a\r\ncorrect account of their situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY TWO.\r\n\r\nINFLATION AND FAILURE.\r\n\r\nAt length arrived the hour for making that important experiment--as to\r\nwhether their aerial ship would prove herself air-worthy.\r\n\r\nAll three stood around the spot where the chopped grass and shawl-wool\r\nwere to be set on fire.  This fuel itself appeared underneath--in a\r\nlittle heap lightly laid, and ready for the touch of the tinder.\r\n\r\nKarl had a piece of blazing torch in his hand; Caspar held one of the\r\nstay-ropes, to prevent the balloon from rising too rapidly; while\r\nOssaroo, equipped as if for a journey, stood by the hamper, in\r\nreadiness, when the proper time should arrive, to \"pack\" himself into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAlas! for the frailty of all human foresight!  The most careful\r\ncalculations often prove erroneous--not that in the present instance\r\nthere was any unforeseen error: for from the very first, Karl had been\r\ndistrustful of his data; and they were now to disappoint, rather than\r\ndeceive him.  It was not written in the book of destiny that Ossaroo\r\nshould ever set foot in that wicker car or ever make an ascent by that\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\nThe torch was applied to the chopped grass and shawl-wool.  Both blazed\r\nand smoked, and smouldered; and, more being thrown on, the blaze was\r\nkept up continuously.  The heated air ascended through the aperture,\r\ncausing the great sphere of stitched skins to swell out to its full\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nIt trembled and rocked from side to side, like some huge monster in\r\npain.  It rose to the height of a few inches from the ground, sank, and\r\nthen rose again, sank once more, and so kept on rising and sinking and\r\nbobbing about, but alas! never exhibiting sufficient ascending power, to\r\nraise the hamper even as high as their heads!\r\n\r\nKarl continued to feed the furnace with the chopped grass and poshm, but\r\nall to no purpose.  The air within was sufficiently heated to have\r\nraised it for miles--had they only been as low as the sea-level, and the\r\nballoon constructed of lighter materials.\r\n\r\nAs it was, all their efforts were in vain.  The gigantic globe could not\r\nbe raised above six feet from the ground.  It had not power enough to\r\ncarry up a cat--much less a man.  In short, it was a failure--one more\r\nadded to the long list of their dark disappointments!\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour Karl continued to keep his fire ablaze.  He even\r\ntried faggots of the resinous pine: in hopes that by obtaining a greater\r\nstrength of caloric he might still succeed in causing the balloon to\r\nsoar upward; but there was no perceptible difference in the effect.  It\r\nbobbed about as before, but still obstinately refused to ascend.\r\n\r\nAt length, with patience exhausted and hopes completely crushed, the\r\nengineer turned away from the machine which he had taken so much pains\r\nin constructing.  For a moment he stood irresolute.  Then heaving a sigh\r\nat the recollection of his wasted labour, with sad, slow step he\r\ndeparted from the spot.  Caspar soon followed him--fully participating\r\nin the feeling of grievous disappointment.  Ossaroo took leave of the\r\ninflated monster in a different fashion.  Drawing near to it, he stood\r\nfor some seconds contemplating it in silence--as if reflecting on the\r\nvast amount of seam he had stitched to no purpose.  Then uttering a\r\nnative ejaculation, coupled with a phrase that meant to say, \"No good\r\neither for the earth, the water, or the air,\" he raised his foot, kicked\r\nthe balloon in the side--with such violence that the toe of his sandals\r\nburst a hole in the distended eel-skins; and, turning scornfully away,\r\nleft the worthless machine to take care of itself.\r\n\r\nThis task, however, it proved ill adapted to accomplish: for the\r\ndisappointed aeronauts had not been gone many minutes from the ground,\r\nwhen the heated air inside, which had for some time been gradually\r\ngrowing cooler, reached at length so low a temperature, that the great\r\nsphere began to collapse and settle down upon the embers of the pine\r\nfaggots still glowing red underneath.  The consequence was that the\r\ninflammable skins, cords, and woodwork coming in contact with the fire,\r\nbegan to burn like so much tinder.  The flames ran upward, licking the\r\noily eel-skins like the tongues of fiery serpents; and when the\r\n_ci-devant_ aeronauts looked back from the door of their hut, they\r\nperceived that the balloon was ablaze!\r\n\r\nHad the accident occurred two hours before, they would have looked upon\r\nit as the saddest of calamities.  Now, however, they stood regarding the\r\nburning of that abandoned balloon, with as much indifference as is said\r\nto have been exhibited by Nero, while contemplating the conflagration of\r\nthe seven-hilled city!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY THREE.\r\n\r\nANOTHER SPELL OF DESPAIR.\r\n\r\nNever, during all the days of their sojourn in that \"Valley of Despond,\"\r\ndid our adventurers feel more despondence, than on the afternoon that\r\nsucceeded the bursting of their great air-bubble--the balloon.  They\r\nfelt that in this effort, they had exhausted all their ingenuity; and so\r\nfirmly were they convinced of its being the last, that no one thought\r\nabout making another.  The spirits of all three were prostrate in the\r\ndust, and seemed at length to have surrendered to despair.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was not that sort of despair which takes possession of one\r\nconscious of coming and certain death.  It was far from being so dire as\r\nthis; but for all it was a bitter feeling.  They knew they could\r\ncontinue to live, perhaps as long there, as elsewhere upon the earth;\r\nbut what would life be worth to them, cut off from all communication\r\nwith the world?--for now, to the fulness of conviction, did they believe\r\nthemselves thus isolated.\r\n\r\nIn disposition not one of the three had the slightest particle of the\r\nhermit.  Not one of them, but would have shuddered at the thought of\r\nbecoming a Simon Stylites.  You might suppose that, with books and\r\nNature to study, Karl could have made shift.  True, with such companions\r\nhe might have lived a less irksome life than either of the others; but\r\neven with these to occupy him, it is doubtful whether Karl could have\r\npassed the time; for it is not very certain, that a man--knowing himself\r\nalone in the world, and for ever to be alone--would care either for the\r\nbooks of men or the book of Nature.\r\n\r\nAs for Caspar, the thought that their lonely existence was to be\r\nperpetual, was enough at times to send the blood rushing coldly through\r\nhis veins.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoo felt the affliction as much as either of his companions in\r\nmisfortune; and sighed as much for his bamboo hut on the hot plains of\r\nHindostan, as they for their home in the far fatherland of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nIt is true their situation was not so bad as if each had been left alone\r\nby himself.  Many a poor castaway upon a desert island has been\r\ncondemned to a far more unhappy fate.  They knew and acknowledged this.\r\nEach had the other two for companions; but as they reflected thus, they\r\ncould not hinder their thoughts from casting forward into the future--\r\nperhaps not distant--when one of them might leave that valley without\r\nthe aid of either rope-ladders or balloons; and then another--leaving\r\nthe last of the three lonely and forlorn!\r\n\r\nWith such sad reflections did they pass the evening of that day, and the\r\nmorning and evening of that which followed.  They took no heed of time;\r\nand could scarce summon sufficient energy to cook their frugal meals.\r\nThe spirit to plan, and the energy to act, seemed both to have departed\r\nfrom them at once and for ever.\r\n\r\nThis state of things could not long continue.  As already said, the soul\r\nof man holds within itself a power of resuscitation.  So long as it\r\ncontinues to live, it may hope to recover from the heaviest blow.\r\nBroken hearts are more apparent than real; and even those that are worst\r\nshattered have their intervals in which they are restored to a perfect\r\nsoundness.  The slave in his chains, the prisoner within his dark\r\ndungeon, the castaway on his desert isle, all have their hours of joy--\r\nperhaps as vivid and lasting as those of the king upon his throne, or\r\nthe conqueror in his car of triumph.\r\n\r\nOn earth there is no happiness unmingled with alloy; and, perhaps, there\r\nis no sorrow that may not in time find solace.\r\n\r\nOn the second clay succeeding their last great disappointment, the\r\nspirits of all three began to revive; and those natural wants--which,\r\nwhether we will or not, force themselves upon our attention--commenced\r\nto claim their consideration.\r\n\r\nKarl was the first to recognise these necessities.  If they were to live\r\nthere for life, he reasoned,--and this seemed no longer a doubtful\r\nsupposition,--it would be of no use, giving way to despondency--moping\r\nout their days like mutes at a funeral.  Better far to lead an active\r\nlife; and live well too--by providing plenty to eat and plenty to\r\ndrink--which with industry they could easily do.  All this might not\r\nmake them cheerful; but they would certainly be less a prey to\r\nmelancholy while engaged in some active industry, than if they remained\r\nbrooding over their fate.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts, as we have said, arose on the morning of the second day\r\nsucceeding that on which the balloon had been abandoned.  Karl gave\r\nwords to them, in an attempt to cheer his brother Caspar--who had\r\nrelapsed into a state of unusual despondency.  Ossaroo equally required\r\ncheering; and therefore it devolved on the botanist to attempt\r\nenlivening the spirits of his companions.\r\n\r\nFor a time, he met with very slight success; but gradually the necessity\r\nof action forced itself upon the attention of all--if only to provide\r\nthe means to keep them from starving; and without further loss of time,\r\nthey resumed the various branches of industry, by which they had\r\nhitherto been enabled to supply their larder.\r\n\r\nTo Caspar, as before, the chase was entrusted; while Ossaroo attended to\r\nthe fishing; as he, better than either of the others, understood the\r\nmanagement of hooks, lines, and nets.\r\n\r\nThe botanist busied himself in the old way, exploring the valley, in\r\nsearch of such seeds, plants, and roots, as might be found wholesome for\r\nfood--not neglecting others of a medicinal character, that might serve\r\nin case of sickness.  Many such had the young plant-hunter encountered\r\nduring his early researches; and had made note of them against the\r\npossibility of their being required.\r\n\r\nFortunately, up to that time there had been no real need for any of the\r\nparty to make trial of the natural _Pharmacopoeia_ which the valley\r\nafforded: and it was to be hoped they should never have occasion to test\r\nthe virtues of the specifics which the plant-hunter had discovered.\r\nKarl nevertheless collected several kinds; and, after submitting them to\r\na process necessary for their preservation, had stored them away within\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\nOf those vegetable products adapted for food, the chief article obtained\r\nwas the nutritive seed yielded by the edible pine (_Pinus Gerardiana_).\r\nThe cones of this valuable tree were as large as artichokes; each\r\nyielding several seeds of the size and appearance of pistachio nuts.\r\n\r\nThe wild cockscomb (_Amaranthus Cruentus_) also furnished a portion of\r\ntheir supply.  Its seeds when parched, and crushed between two stones,\r\nproduced a kind of meal, of which cakes of bread were manufactured by\r\nOssaroo.  These, although very far inferior to the real home-bake, or\r\neven to the most ordinary production of the bakehouse, were nevertheless\r\nsufficiently palatable to those who had no other bread.\r\n\r\nThe lake, besides yielding fish to the nets of Ossaroo, also afforded a\r\nsupply of vegetables.  On searching it, the botanist discovered several\r\nedible kinds of plants; among others the curious _Trapa bicornis_, or\r\nhorned water-nut--known among the natives of the Himalayan countries by\r\nthe name _Singara_, and much used by them as an article of wholesome\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThere was also a splendid water-lily--with very broad leaves and large\r\nflowers of pink and white colour--the seeds and the stalks of which Karl\r\nknew to be edible; as he had read of their being used for this purpose\r\nby the poorer people in the country of Cashmeer.  The lily in question,\r\nviz. the _Nelumbium speciosum_, grows plentifully in the lakes of the\r\nfar-famed valley so named.\r\n\r\nOn first observing this beautiful plant growing luxuriantly, as it was,\r\nin their own little valley lake, Karl took occasion to inform his\r\nbrother--Ossaroo at the same time listening attentively to his\r\nstatement--of the various uses made of it by the inhabitants of\r\nCashmeer.  How the boys sailing about in their boats when the day\r\nchances to be very hot, are in the habit of plucking one of its large\r\nshining leaves out of the water, and spreading it over their crowns, to\r\nprotect them from the fervid rays of the sun; and how the petiole of the\r\nleaf, being hollow inside, serves them as a tube for drinking out of.\r\nMany such interesting particulars, in regard to the economy of this fine\r\naquatic plant, did the young botanist communicate to his companions; but\r\nnone more interesting than the fact that both its seeds and stalks are\r\nedible: since this promised them additional security against the danger\r\nof running short in their supply of vegetable food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE BEAN OF PYTHAGORAS.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the water-lily was not a thing of recent occurrence.\r\nThey had known of its existence before; and more than once had visited\r\nthe little embayment in the lake, where it chiefly grew.  In fact, it\r\nhad attracted their attention a few days after their first arrival in\r\nthe valley--not by its own conspicuousness, for its broad round leaves,\r\nspread horizontally upon the surface, could scarce be seen from the\r\nshore.  Only when its beautiful pink-white flowers were in bloom, could\r\nit be observed at any great distance.\r\n\r\nThat which had first led them to approach the place where it grew, and\r\nexamine the plant, was their having noticed a singular phenomenon\r\nconnected with it; and which for awhile had puzzled all three of them to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nThe _bed_ of lilies, at that time in full bloom, was visible from the\r\nplace where they had originally made their encampment; and every\r\nmorning, just after daybreak, and sometimes also during the day, they\r\nwere in the habit of seeing some birds disporting themselves near that\r\nplace in a singular manner--very singular indeed: since these birds\r\nappeared to _walk upon the water_!\r\n\r\nThey were tall, long-legged, slender-bodied creatures, and easily\r\ndistinguished by both Karl and Caspar, as belonging to the family of\r\n_rallidae_ or water-hens.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt that they were walking on the water--sometimes\r\nslowly, at other times in a quick run--and, what was even more\r\nunaccountable than this, they were seen at times to _stand still upon\r\nthe water_!  Ay, and, what might be considered more surprising still,\r\nthey performed this aquatic feat _upon only one leg_!\r\n\r\nThe thing might have been more mysterious, had not Karl from the first\r\nsuspected the reason why the laws of specific gravity appeared to be\r\nthus contradicted.  He suspected the existence of some plant, whose\r\nleaves, lying spread on the surface, perhaps offered a footing for the\r\nbirds, sufficiently firm to support the weight of their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe botanist was only reasoning from remembrance.  He had lately read\r\nthe account published but a few years before of the discovery of the\r\ngigantic water-lily of tropical America--the _Victoria Regia_--and\r\nremembered how its discoverers had spoken of large birds of the crane\r\nfamily making their perch upon its huge leaves, and thus supported,\r\nplaying about over the surface of the water, as if the firm earth had\r\nbeen under their feet.\r\n\r\nWith these facts fresh in his memory, Karl conjectured that the\r\nwater-hens seen by him and his companions were supported on a similar\r\npedestal, and playing themselves on a like platform.  His conjecture\r\nproved correct: for on visiting the place shortly after, the broad\r\norbicular leaves of the _Nelumbium speciosum_ were perceived--almost as\r\nlarge as those of their South American congener.\r\n\r\nOther interesting points relating to the great lily growing in the\r\nHimalayan lake, Karl had mentioned from time to time to his companions:\r\nfor he knew that the _Nelumbium speciosum_ was the celebrated\r\nPythagorean bean mentioned in the writings of the Greeks--more\r\nespecially by Herodotus and Theophrastes.\r\n\r\nIt is described by these writers as growing plentifully in Egypt; and no\r\ndoubt was cultivated in that country in their day; though it is not\r\nknown there at the present time.  It is found represented on the\r\nEgyptian sculptures, and so accurately has it been described by the\r\nGreek writers, as to leave no doubt as to the identification of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the plants supposed to be the celebrated \"lotus\" of\r\nantiquity; and this supposition is probable enough: since not only its\r\nsucculent stalk, but its seeds or \"beans,\" have been eaten in all times\r\nby the people in whose country it grows.  It is a food that produces a\r\nstrengthening effect upon the system; and is also very refreshing in\r\ncases of thirst.  The Chinese call it \"Lienwha,\" and its seeds with thin\r\nslices of its root, mixed with the kernels of apricots and walnuts, and\r\nplaced between alternate layers of ice, constituted one of the select\r\ndishes offered by the great mandarins to the British ambassadors on the\r\nvisit of the latter to the Celestial Empire.\r\n\r\nThese people store up the roots of the lienwha for winter use--\r\npreserving them in a pickle of salt and vinegar.  The Japanese also make\r\nuse of the plant as an esculent; and it is, moreover, regarded by them\r\nas sacred to their divinities--the images of which are often represented\r\nseated upon its large leaves.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the _Nelumbium speciosum_ when in full bloom, give out a\r\nmost fragrant odour--somewhat resembling that of anise; while the seeds,\r\nshaped like acorns, have a flavour equal in richness and delicacy to\r\nthat of the finest almonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nAN AQUATIC HARVEST.\r\n\r\nIt was not upon that occasion that Karl communicated to his companions\r\nall these interesting facts in relation to the great lily.  Many of them\r\nhe had made known long before--especially that the seeds of the plant\r\nwere eatable; and both Caspar and Ossaroo had often proved to their own\r\nsatisfaction that they were something more than eatable--in short, a\r\ngreat delicacy.\r\n\r\nIt was from a knowledge of this fact that the thoughts of all three were\r\nnow turned upon the lilies--whose huge roseate corollas, no longer seen\r\nglistening above the surface of the water, proclaimed that the \"beans\"\r\nwere ripe, and ready for \"shelling.\"\r\n\r\nThe three were about starting from the hut to reap this aquatic\r\nharvest--which, judging from the quantity of seed-pods that appeared\r\nabove the surface, promised to be abundant.\r\n\r\nEach had provided himself with a rush basket--which the shikaree had\r\nwoven, during the long winter nights, for other purposes; but as they\r\nwere of just the size and shape to hold the Pythagorean beans they were\r\nnow to be employed in that capacity.\r\n\r\nBoth Karl and Caspar had rolled up their trowsers to mid-thigh; so as\r\nnot to wet them while wading among the lilies; but Ossaroo, not being\r\nprovided with any nether garment entitled to the name of trowsers, had\r\nsimply tucked up the skirt of his cotton tunic, making it fast under his\r\ngirdle.\r\n\r\nIn this guise all three proceeded round the shore of the lake, to that\r\nside where they would be nearest the bed of lilies.  The water-hens,\r\nseeing them make their approach, rose from their perch upon the leaves,\r\nand fluttered off to seek a more secure shelter among the sedge.\r\n\r\nThe aquatic gleaners at once waded in; and commenced picking off the\r\npods, and shelling them into their rush baskets.  They had been there\r\nbefore, and knew there was no danger in the depth of the water.\r\n\r\nThey had nearly filled their respective sacks with the Pythagorean\r\nbeans, and were meditating a return to dry land, when a dark shadow\r\npassing over the tranquil surface of the lake--closely followed by\r\nanother of similar size and shape--attracted their attention.\r\n\r\nAll three saw the shadows at the same instant of time; and all\r\nsimultaneously looked up to ascertain what sort of creatures were\r\ncasting them.  In the sky above they beheld a spectacle, calculated to\r\ninspire them with feelings of a strange interest.\r\n\r\nRight above the lake, and also over their heads, a brace of large birds\r\nwas circling in the air.  Each was borne up by a pair of huge wings full\r\nfive yards from tip to tip; while from the body, between, a neck of\r\nenormous length was extended horizontally--prolonged into a\r\ntapering-pointed beak, in shape like the seed-pistil of a pelargonium.\r\n\r\nTheir beaks might well have been compared to the pistil of a\r\npelargonium; or rather the latter should be assimilated to them; since\r\nit is from this species of birds, the flower has derived its botanical\r\ncognomen.\r\n\r\nThe birds were _storks_.  Not the ordinary _Ciconia_, that makes its\r\nhome among the Hollanders--or finds a still more welcome hospitality on\r\nthe roof-tree of the Hungarian by the plains of the _Puszta_--but a\r\nstork of far grander dimensions; in short, a stork that is the _tallest_\r\nof his tribe--the _Adjutant_.\r\n\r\nOn looking up, Karl recognised the species; so did Caspar, and at a\r\nglance.  It required no lengthened scrutiny--no profound knowledge of\r\nnatural history, to identify the noted _adjutant_.  It only needed to\r\nhave seen him before either in _propria persona_, or in a picture; but\r\nboth brothers had seen specimens of the bird, in full flesh and feather,\r\non the plains of India--in the environs of Calcutta itself.\r\n\r\nAs to the shikaree, was it likely he should be mistaken about the\r\ncharacter of those winged giants--those tall scavengers he had seen\r\nthousands of times stalking pompously along the sandy shores of the\r\nsacred Ganges?  It was not possible for him, to have a doubt about the\r\nidentity of the birds, who were now throwing their shadows over that\r\nlone lake of the Himalayas.  He had no doubt.  The very certainty that\r\nthe birds above him were the gigantic cranes of the Ganges--the sacred\r\nbirds of Brahma--caused him to utter a sort of frenzied shout, and at\r\nthe same time, dropping his \"sack of beans\" into the water!\r\n\r\nHe needed not to look at the colour of the birds, to note that they were\r\nbrown black above, and white underneath.  The naked vulture neck with\r\nits pouch-like appendage of brick-red hue; the silken feathers of bluish\r\nwhite under the tail--those precious plumes well-known and worn by the\r\nladies of many lands under the appellation of _marabout feathers_--all\r\nwere recognised at a glance.\r\n\r\nEven quicker than either of his youthful comrades had the Hindoo\r\nidentified the birds.  A single glance sufficed, and simultaneously with\r\nthat glance had the cry fallen from his lips, and the sack of\r\nPythagorean beans from his grasp.\r\n\r\nThe birds were flying slowly, and to all appearance _laboriously_: as if\r\nwearied of wing.  They appeared to be in search of some roost on which\r\nto repose themselves.\r\n\r\nThat they had entered the valley with this intention was made evident a\r\nfew moments after: for having made a circuit round the little lake, both\r\nat the same instant ceased to ply their long pinions, and drawing their\r\nwings suddenly in to their bodies, they settled down upon the shore.\r\n\r\nThe spot upon which they had chosen to alight was the prominence\r\nterminating a little peninsula that protruded out almost to the bed of\r\nlilies, and from which the three waders had themselves descended into\r\nthe water.  As the latter now stood knee-deep among the aquatic plants,\r\nthey were distant not more than twenty paces from the point of this\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\nThe storks, after alighting, stood upon the shore in erect attitudes--\r\napparently as unconcerned about the presence of our three adventurers,\r\nas if the latter were only overgrown stalks of the Pythagorean bean--\r\nutterly incapable of doing them an injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE ADJUTANTS.\r\n\r\nThe brace of gigantic birds, that had thus alighted by the shore of the\r\nlittle lake, were, to say the least, uncouth creatures; for the whole\r\nornithological world might be ransacked without finding a greater oddity\r\nthan the _adjutant_.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it stands six feet upon its long, straight shanks;\r\nthough its actual length, measuring from the tip of its bill to the\r\ntermination of its claws, is full seven and a half.  The beak, of\r\nitself, is over a foot in length, several inches in thickness, with a\r\ngibbous enlargement near the middle, and having both mandibles slightly\r\ncurved downwards.\r\n\r\nThe spread of a full-grown adjutant's wing is fifteen feet, or five\r\nyards, from tip to tip--quite equalling in extent either that of the\r\nChilian condor or the \"wandering\" albatross.\r\n\r\nIn colour the adjutant may be described as black above and white\r\nunderneath, neither [that] being very pure.  The upper plumage is a\r\ndirty brownish black; while the belly and under parts present a dull\r\nwhite appearance,--partly from an admixture of greyish feathers, but\r\nalso from the circumstance that the bird is usually bedaubed with dirt--\r\nas mud from the marshes, where it feeds, and other filth, in which it\r\nseems to take delight.  But for this foulness, the legs of the adjutant\r\nwould be of a dark colour; but in the living bird they are never seen of\r\nthe natural hue--being always whitened by the dust shaken out of its\r\nplumage, and other excrement that attaches itself to the skin.\r\n\r\nThe tail is black above and white underneath--more especially the under\r\ncoverts, which are of a pure white.  These last are the plumes so highly\r\nprized under the name of \"marabout feathers,\" an erroneous title,\r\narising through a mistake--made by the naturalist Temminck in comparing\r\nthe Indian adjutant with another and very different species of the same\r\ngenus--the marabout stork of Africa.\r\n\r\nOne of the distinctive characteristics of the adjutant, or \"argala,\" as\r\nit is better known to the Indians,--and one, too, of its ugliest\r\n\"features,\"--is a naked neck of a flesh-red colour the skin shrivelled,\r\ncorrugated, and covered with brownish hairs.  These \"bristles\" are more\r\nthickly set in young birds, but become thinner with age, until they\r\nalmost totally disappear--leaving both head and neck quite naked.\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity causes a resemblance between the adjutant bird and the\r\nvultures; but indeed there are many other points of similarity; and the\r\nstork may in all respects be regarded as a vulture--the vulture of the\r\n_grallatores_, or waders.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the naked neck, the adjutant is furnished with an immense\r\ndew-lap, or pouch which hangs down upon its breast--often more than a\r\nfoot in length, and changing from pale flesh colour to bright red, along\r\nwith the skin of the throat.  At the back of the neck is found still\r\nanother singular apparatus--the use of which has not been determined by\r\nthe naturalist.  It is a sort of vesicular appendage, capable of being\r\ninflated with air; and supposed to serve as an atmospheric buoy to\r\nassist in sustaining the bird in its flight.  The inflation has been\r\nobserved to take place under exposure to a hot sun; and, therefore, it\r\nis natural to infer, that the rarefaction of the air has something to do\r\nin causing [the bird to use this organ].  As the adjutant often flies to\r\na great height, it is possible that this balloon-like apparatus is\r\nnecessary to sustaining it in the rarefied atmosphere found at such an\r\nelevation.  The annual migration of the bird over the lofty chain of the\r\nHimalayas might not be possible, or if possible, more difficult, without\r\nthis power of decreasing the specific gravity of its body.\r\n\r\nIt is scarce necessary to say that the adjutant--like all birds of the\r\nfamily to which it belongs--is a filthy and voracious feeder;\r\ncarnivorous in the highest degree; and preferring carrion and garbage to\r\nany other sort of food.  It will kill and swallow live kind--such as\r\nfrogs, snakes, small quadrupeds, and birds--the latter not so very small\r\neither: since it has been known to bolt a whole fowl at a single\r\n\"swallow.\"  Even a cat or a hare can be accommodated with a passage down\r\nits capacious gullet; but it will not attempt to kill either one or the\r\nother: since, notwithstanding its gigantic size, it is one of the\r\nveriest cowards in creation.  A child, with a bit of a switch, can at\r\nany time chase the adjutant away; and an enraged hen will put it to\r\nflight whenever it strays into the neighbourhood of her young brood.  It\r\ndoes not retreat, without first making a show of defiance--by placing\r\nitself in a threatening attitude--with reddened throat, and beak wide\r\nagape, from which latter proceeds a loud roaring, like that of a bear or\r\ntiger.  All this, however, is mere braggadocio; for, on the enemy\r\ncontinuing the attack, it immediately cools down, and betakes itself to\r\nignominious flight.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few peculiarities of the gigantic stork, known as the\r\n_adjutant_ or _argala_.  It only remains to be added, that there are at\r\nleast two, perhaps three, other species of storks of very large\r\ndimensions--though not so large as this one--that for a long time have\r\nbeen confounded with it.  One of these is the _marabou_; which inhabits\r\nthe tropical regions of Africa, and which also produces the plumes so\r\nmuch prized in the world of fashion.  The feathers of the African\r\nspecies, however, are far less beautiful and valuable than those from\r\nthe tail of the adjutant; and it is these last that are really best\r\nknown as _marabout feathers_, in consequence of the mistake made by\r\nTemminck, and propagated by the anatomist Cuvier.\r\n\r\nAnother great stork--differing both from the _argala_ of Asia and the\r\n_marabou_ of Africa--inhabits the Island of Sumatra.  It is known to the\r\nnatives as the \"Boorong Cambay;\" while in the neighbouring Island of\r\nJava is found either a fourth species of these gigantic birds, or the\r\nsame that belongs to Sumatra.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat singular that such creatures should have remained so long\r\nunknown to the scientific world.  It is not much more than half a\r\ncentury since travellers began to describe them with any degree of\r\nexactness; and even at the present time their history and habits have\r\nreceived but very slight elucidation.  This is the more surprising when\r\nwe consider that on the banks of the Ganges--even in Calcutta itself--\r\nthe adjutant is one of the most common birds--constantly stalking about\r\nthe houses, and entering the enclosures with as much familiarity, as if\r\nit was one of the regular _domestics_ of the establishment!\r\n\r\nIts services as a \"scavenger\" procure for it an immunity from\r\npersecution; and it is not only tolerated by the people, but encouraged,\r\nin its advances towards fellowship with them; notwithstanding that at\r\ntimes it becomes rather troublesome in its attentions to the young\r\nducklings, chicklings, and other denizens of the farmyard.\r\n\r\nSometimes they are not even contented with such fare as may be found\r\noutside; but have been known to enter the bungalow; snatch a smoking\r\njoint from the table; and swallow it, before either master or servant\r\ncould rescue the dainty morsel from between their long and tenacious\r\nmandibles!\r\n\r\nWhen seen in flocks, wading through the water,--with wings outstretched,\r\nas is their custom,--they may be taken for a fleet of small boats.  At\r\nother times, when stalking about over the sandy shores; and picking up\r\nthe _debris_ strewed along the banks of the sacred river; they resemble\r\na crowd of native women engaged in the like occupation.\r\n\r\nOfttimes may they be seen feeding voraciously upon the filthiest carrion\r\nof animals; and not unfrequently upon a human body in a state of\r\nputrefaction--the corpse of some deluded victim to the superstition of\r\nJuggernaut--which has been thrown into the so-styled _sacred_ river, to\r\nbe washed back on the beach, an object of contention between _pariah_\r\ndogs, vultures, and these gigantic cranes of the Ganges!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nThe standing sleepers.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the adjutants produced a vivid impression on the minds of\r\nall three of our adventurers--more vivid, perhaps, upon Ossaroo than\r\neither of the others.  To him they seemed like old friends who had come\r\nto visit him in his prison; and though it never occurred to the\r\nshikaree, that they could be in any way instrumental in obtaining his\r\nrelease, still the impression produced was one of a pleasant nature.  He\r\nsaw before him two creatures whose forms, however uncouth, were\r\nassociated with the scenes of his earliest childhood; and he could not\r\nhelp a passing fancy, that the pair, that had thus unexpectedly made\r\ntheir appearance, might be the same old cock and hen he had so often\r\nseen roosted on the branches of a huge banyan tree, that overshadowed\r\nthe bungalow in which he was born.\r\n\r\nOf course this could be only fancy on the part of Ossaroo.  Out of the\r\nthousands of storks, that annually make their migration from the plains\r\nof Hindostan to the northward of the Himalaya Mountains, it would have\r\nbeen a rare coincidence if the two that for years had performed the\r\noffice of scavengers in the shikaree's native village, should be\r\nidentical with those now hovering above his head--for it was while they\r\nwere yet upon the wing that Ossaroo had indulged in this pleasant\r\nspeculation.  Though scarce serious in his thought--and only\r\nentertaining it for an instant--he was nevertheless gratified by the\r\nsight of the two storks, for he knew they must have come from his native\r\nplains--from the banks of that glorious river in whose waters he longed\r\nonce more to wet his feet.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the huge birds suggested to Caspar a different train of\r\nthought.  As he beheld their immense wings, extended in slow but easy\r\nflight, it occurred to him that one or other of the great creatures\r\nmight have the power to perform that task which had proved too much for\r\nthe bearcoot; and for which the \"kite\" had been \"flyed\" in vain.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed he, as the idea came across his mind, \"don't you think,\r\nKarl, that either of those great creatures would be strong enough to\r\ncarry the line aloft?  They look as if they could lift even one of\r\nourselves to the top of the cliff.\"\r\n\r\nKarl made no reply; though his silence was only caused by Caspar's\r\nsuggestion--which he was proceeding to ponder upon.\r\n\r\nThe young hunter continued: \"If we could only catch one of them alive!\r\nDo you suppose they are going to alight?  They look as if they would.\r\nWhat do _you_ say, Ossaroo?  You know more of these birds than we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yees, youngee Sahib; ee speakee de true.  Dey go for come down.  You\r\nsavey dey make long fly.  Dey both weary on de wing--no able fly furder.\r\n'Sides, ee see, here am de lake--water--dey want drinkee--want eat too.\r\nDey sure come down.\"\r\n\r\nOssaroo's prediction was fulfilled, almost as soon as it was uttered.\r\nThe birds, first one and then the other, jerked in their spread wings;\r\nand dropped down upon the shore of the lake--as already stated, not over\r\ntwenty paces from the spot where the three waders were occupied among\r\nthe leaves of the lilies.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of all three were now directed with a fixed gaze upon the\r\nnew-comers,--in whose behaviour they observed something irresistibly\r\nludicrous.\r\n\r\nAlmost on the instant of their feet touching _terra firma_, instead of\r\nmoving about over the ground in search of food, or striding down towards\r\nthe water to drink--as the spectators were expecting them to do--the two\r\nlong-legged bipeds acted in an entirely different manner.  Neither of\r\nthem seemed to care either for food or drink.  If they did, both these\r\nappetites must have been secondary with them to the desire for rest; for\r\nscarce ten seconds had elapsed after their alighting, when each drew in\r\nits long neck, burying it between the shoulders as in a case, leaving\r\nvisible only the upper half of the head, with its huge scythe-shaped\r\nbeak--the mandibles resting against the prominence of the breast bone,\r\nand pointing diagonally downwards.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous with this movement, the spectators perceived another--\r\nequally indicative of a desire on the part of the birds to betake\r\nthemselves to repose.  This was the drawing up of one of their long\r\nfleshless legs, until it was entirely concealed under the loose feathers\r\nof the belly--a movement made by both so exactly at the same instant, as\r\nto lead to the belief that they were actuated by like impulses, by some\r\nspiritual union that existed between them!\r\n\r\nIn ten seconds more both birds appeared to be asleep.  At all events,\r\ntheir eyes were closed; and not a movement could be detected in the\r\nlimbs, wings, bodies, or beaks of either!\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a ludicrous sight to see these huge creatures--each\r\nsupporting itself on a single stalk, so straight and slender that\r\nnothing but the nicest balance could have ensured their equilibrium; and\r\nthis, too, while neither seemed conscious of any danger of toppling\r\nover--of which, indeed, there was not the slightest reason to be afraid.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoo had been too long accustomed to this sort of spectacle, to\r\nsee anything in it worthy of being laughed at.  Not so Caspar--whose\r\nmirth was at once excited to the point of risibility.  The unconcerned\r\nmanner in which the storks had come to a stand--along with the\r\npicturesque _pose_ in which they had composed themselves to sleep--was\r\neven too much for the stoical Karl; who at once echoed the laughter\r\nwhich his brother had inaugurated.\r\n\r\nTheir united cachinnations rang loudly over the lake--reverberating in\r\nrepeated peals from the adjacent cliffs.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the _fracas_ thus created would have alarmed\r\nthe new arrivals: and caused them once more to make an appeal to their\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nNothing of the sort.  The only effect perceptible on either, was the\r\nopening of their eyes, a slight protrusion of the neck, a shake of the\r\nhead, an upraising of the long beak, with a quick clattering of its\r\nmandibles--which soon becoming closed again, were permitted to drop into\r\ntheir original position of repose.\r\n\r\nThis cool behaviour of the birds only increased the hilarity of the\r\nboys; and for several minutes they remained in their places, giving way\r\nto loud and uncontrollable laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nFRITZ AMONG THE FEATHERS.\r\n\r\nTheir hilarity could not be continued for ever.  Even that of Caspar\r\ncame to a termination; though not until his ribs ached with the\r\nagreeable exercise.\r\n\r\nAs their bean-sacks had been already filled, it was determined that they\r\nshould first take them to the hut, and then return to the storks with\r\nthe design of capturing them.  Ossaroo was of the opinion, that they\r\nwould have no difficulty in effecting this; declaring the birds to be so\r\ntame, that he might walk straight up to them, and throw a noose over\r\ntheir necks.  This, in all probability, he might have done, had he been\r\nprovided with a piece of cord proper for the making of such a noose.\r\nBut there was no cord at hand--not even a bit of string--nothing but the\r\nrush baskets filled with the lotus beans.  To obtain a snare, it would\r\nbe necessary to make a journey to the hut.\r\n\r\nIn the minds of our adventurers there was no very clear conception of\r\nthe object of capturing the storks: unless it might have been that the\r\nthought, to which Caspar had given speech, was still entertained by\r\nhimself and his brother.  That indeed would have justified them in their\r\nattempt to take the birds.\r\n\r\nAnother idea may have suggested itself--more especially to Ossaroo.  If\r\nnothing else should come of it, there would be some pleasure in holding\r\nthe birds in captivity--as pets and companions.  Ossaroo had been\r\ninvoluntarily contemplating the prospect of a long lonely life in the\r\nsolitude of that mountain valley.  With such a prospect even the solemn\r\nstork might be regarded as a cheerful companion.\r\n\r\nStimulated by these thoughts--and some others of a more indefinite\r\nkind--our adventurers came to the determination to ensnare the\r\n_adjutants_!\r\n\r\nAll three commenced wading out of the lake--in a direction so as not to\r\ndisturb the sleepers.  Karl and Caspar--now that they had become\r\ninspired with a design--lifted their feet out of the water, and set them\r\ndown again, as though they ere treading upon egg.  Ossaroo sneered at\r\ntheir over-caution--telling them, that there was not the slightest fear\r\nof frightening the storks; and indeed there was truth in what he\r\naffirmed.\r\n\r\nIn most countries bordering upon the banks of the Ganges, these birds,\r\nprotected alike by superstitious fears and edicts of law, have become so\r\nused to the proximity of man, that they will scarce stir out of their\r\nway to avoid him.  It was possible that the brace in question might have\r\nbelonged to some of the wilder flocks--inhabiting the swamps of the\r\nSunderbunds--and therefore less accustomed to human society.  In that\r\ncase there might be some difficulty in approaching them; and it was for\r\nthis reason that Ossaroo had consented to adopt the precautions for\r\ntheir capture which Karl had insisted should be taken.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that Karl had conceived a deeper design than either of his\r\ncompanions.  It had occurred to him--while engaged with his brother in\r\nthat laughing duetto--and somewhat to the surprise of Caspar, it had\r\ncaused a sudden cessation of his mirth, or at least the noisy ebullition\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher had become silent and serious; as if the thought had\r\nsuddenly arisen, that hilarity under the circumstances was indecorous\r\nand out of place.  From that moment Karl had preserved a mysterious\r\nsilence--even refusing to explain it when interrogated by Caspar.  He\r\nwas only silent on this one theme.  Otherwise his speech flowed freely\r\nenough--in counsel to his companions--charging both to adopt every\r\nprecaution for ensuring the capture of the storks--and with an\r\neagerness, which puzzled them to comprehend.\r\n\r\nA few minutes' walk brought them back to the hut.  It was rather a run\r\nthan a walk--Karl going in the lead, and arriving before either of the\r\nothers.  The bean-sacks were flung upon the floor--as if they had been\r\nempty and of no value--and then the strings and lines that had been spun\r\nby Ossaroo were pulled out of their hidden places, and submitted to\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to make a running noose, which was accomplished by\r\nthe nimble fingers of the shikaree.  Easily also was it attached to the\r\nend of a long stem of the ringall bamboo; and thus provided, our\r\nadventurers once more sallied forth from the hut; and made their way\r\ntowards the sleeping storks.\r\n\r\nAs they drew near, they were gratified at perceiving the birds still in\r\nthe enjoyment of their meridian slumber.  No doubt they had made a long\r\njourney, and needed rest.  Their wings hung drooping by their sides,\r\nproclaiming weariness.  Perhaps they were dreaming--dreaming of a roost\r\non some tall fig-tree, or the tower of an antique temple sacred to the\r\nworship of Buddha, Vishna, or Deva--dreaming of the great Ganges, and\r\nits odorous waifs--those savoury morsels of putrefying flesh, in which\r\nthey delighted to dig their huge mattocks of mandibles.\r\n\r\nOssaroo being entrusted with the noose, did not pause to think, about\r\nwhat they might be dreaming; or whether they were dreaming at all.\r\nEnough for him to perceive that they were sleeping; and, gliding forward\r\nin a bent attitude, silent as a tiger threading his native jungle, the\r\nshikaree succeeded in making approach--until he had got almost within\r\n_snaring distance_ of the unconscious adjutants.\r\n\r\nThere is many a slip between the cup and the lip.  The old saw was\r\nillustrated in the case of the shikaree while endeavouring to ensnare\r\nthe storks; though it was not the snare, but the birds that now\r\nillustrated the adage.\r\n\r\nAfter the attempt had been made, the snare could be still seen in its\r\nplace, stiffly projecting from the point of the long bamboo rod; while\r\nthe adjutants were soaring in the air, mounting still higher upward,\r\ntheir slender necks outstretched, their beaks cracking like castanets,\r\nand their throats emitting an angry sound like the roaring of a brace of\r\nlions.\r\n\r\nThe failure was not to be attributed to Ossaroo; but to the imprudence\r\nof one of his companions--an individual of the party close treading upon\r\nhis heels.  That individual was _Fritz_!\r\n\r\nJust as Ossaroo was about casting his loop over the shoulders of a\r\nsleeping adjutant, Fritz--who had followed the party from the hut--now\r\nfor the first time perceiving the birds, rushed forward and seized the\r\ntail of one of them between his teeth.  Then, as if determined on\r\nsecuring the beautiful _marabout feathers_, he pulled a large mouthful\r\nof them clean out by the roots.\r\n\r\nThis was not exactly the motive that impelled Fritz to make such an\r\nunexpected attack--unexpected, because the well-trained animal would\r\nhave known better than to fright the game which his masters were in the\r\nact of stalking; and such imprudence had never before been displayed by\r\nhim.  It was the particular kind of game that had provoked Fritz to act\r\ncontrary to his usual habit of caution; for of all the creatures which\r\nhe had encountered, since his arrival in the counted there, was none\r\nthat had inspired him with a more profound feeling of hostility than\r\nthese same adjutants.  During Fritz's sojourn in the Botanic Gardens of\r\nCalcutta--where his masters, it will be remembered, were for some time\r\nentertained as guests--Fritz had often come in contact with a brace of\r\nthese gigantic birds, that were also guests of that justly celebrated\r\nestablishment: they habitually made their stay within the enclosure,\r\nwhere they were permitted to stalk about unmolested, and pick up such\r\nstray scraps as were cast out by the domestics of the _curator's_\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nThese birds had grown so tame, as to take food freely out of the hand of\r\nanyone who offered it to them; and with like freedom, to take it where\r\nit was not offered, but found within reach of their long prehensile\r\nbeaks.  Often had they pilfered provisions to which they were anything\r\nbut welcome; and, among other acts of their rapacity, there was one of\r\nwhich Fritz had been an interested spectator, and for which he was not\r\nlikely ever to forgive them.  That was, their robbing him of a dainty\r\npiece of meat, which one of the cooks had presented to Fritz himself;\r\nand upon which he had been going to make his dinner.  One of the birds\r\nhad the audacity to seize the meat in its mandibles, jerk it out of the\r\ndog's very teeth, and swallow it, before the latter had time to offer\r\neither interruption or remonstrance.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was, that, from that time, Fritz had conceived a most\r\nrancorous antipathy towards all birds of the genus _Ciconia_--and the\r\nspecies _Argala_ in particular; and this it was that impelled him, on\r\nfirst perceiving the adjutant--for being by the hut on their arrival he\r\nhad not seen them before,--to rush open-mouthed towards them, and seize\r\nthe tail of one of them between his teeth.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to add that the bird, thus indecorously assailed,\r\ntook to instant flight, followed by its more fortunate though not less\r\nfrightened mate--leaving Fritz in a temper to treat Marabout feathers as\r\nthey had never been treated before--even when by the hands of some\r\nscorned and jealous vixen they may have been torn from the turban of\r\nsome hated rival!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY NINE.\r\n\r\nCAPTURING THE STORKS.\r\n\r\nOur adventurers witnessed the uprising of the birds with looks that\r\nbetokened disappointment and displeasure; and Fritz was in danger of\r\ngetting severely castigated.  He merited chastisement; and would have\r\nreceived it on the instant--for Caspar already stood over him with an\r\nupraised rod--when an exclamation from Karl caused the young hunter to\r\nhold his hand, and saved Fritz from the \"hiding\" with which he was being\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nIt was not for this that Karl had called out.  The exclamation that\r\nescaped him was of a different import--so peculiarly intoned as at once\r\nto draw Caspar's attention from the culprit, and fix it on his brother.\r\n\r\nKarl was standing with eyes upraised and gazing fixedly upon the\r\nretreating stork--that one with whose tail Fritz had taken such an\r\nunwarrantable liberty.\r\n\r\nIt was not the ragged Marabout feathers, hanging half plucked from the\r\nposterior of the stork, upon which Karl was gazing; but its long legs,\r\nthat, as the bird rose in its hurried flight, hung, slantingly downward,\r\nextending far beyond the tip of its tail.  Not exactly these either was\r\nit that had called forth that strange cry; but something attached to\r\nthem--or one of them at least--which, as it came under the shining rays\r\nof the sun, gleamed in the eyes of Karl with a metallic lustre.\r\n\r\nIt had a yellowish sheen--like gold or burnished brass--but the\r\nscintillation of the sun's rays, as they glanced from its surface,\r\nhindered the spectators from making out its shape, or being able to say\r\nexactly what it was.\r\n\r\nIt was only Caspar and Ossaroo who were thus perplexed.  Karl knew that\r\nglittering meteor, that for a moment had flashed before his eyes like a\r\nbeam of hope--now slowly but surely departing from him, and plunging him\r\nback into the old misery.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! brother!\" he exclaimed, as the stork flew upward, \"what a\r\nmisfortune has happened!\"\r\n\r\n\"Misfortune! what mean you, Karl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you know not how near we were to a chance of being delivered.\r\nAlas! alas! it is going to escape us!\"\r\n\r\n\"The birds have escaped us, you mean?\" inquired Caspar.  \"What of that?\r\nI don't believe they could have carried up the rope anyhow; and what\r\ngood would it be to catch them?  They're not eatable; and we don't want\r\ntheir feathers valuable as they may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" hurriedly rejoined Karl; \"it is not that--not that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then, brother?\" inquired Caspar, somewhat astonished at the\r\nincoherent speeches of the plant-hunter.  \"What are you thinking of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look yonder!\" said Karl, now for the first time pointing up to the\r\nsoaring storks.  \"You see something that shines?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! on the leg of one of the birds?  Yes; I do see something--like a\r\npiece of yellow metal--what can it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what it is!\" rejoined Karl, in a regretful tone; \"right well do\r\nI know.  Ah! if we could only have caught that bird, there would have\r\nbeen a hope for us.  It's no use grieving after it now.  It's gone--\r\nalas! it's gone; and you, Fritz, have this day done a thing that will\r\ncause us all regret--perhaps for the rest of our lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't comprehend you, brother!\" said Caspar; \"but if it's the escape\r\nof the storks that's to be so much regretted, perhaps it will never take\r\nplace.  They don't appear to be in such a hurry to leave us--\r\nnotwithstanding the inhospitable reception Fritz has given them.  See!\r\nthey are circling about, as if they intended to come down again.  And\r\nsee also Ossaroo--he's holding out a lure for them.  I warrant the old\r\nshikaree will succeed in coaxing them back.  He knows their habits\r\nperfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Father!\" exclaimed Karl, as he looked first at the flying\r\nstorks and then at Ossaroo; \"be it permitted that he succeed!  You,\r\nCaspar, lay hold upon Fritz, and give Ossaroo every chance!  For your\r\nlife don't let the dog get away from you; for your life--for the lives\r\nof all of us!\"\r\n\r\nCaspar, though still under surprise at the excited bearing of his\r\nbrother, did not allow that to hinder him from obeying his command, and\r\nrushing upon Fritz, he caught hold of the dog.  Then placing the hound\r\nbetween his legs, he held him with both hands and knees as tightly as if\r\nFritz had been screwed in a vice.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of all--the dog included--were now turned upon Ossaroo.  Caspar\r\ncontemplated his movements with an undefined interest; while Karl\r\nwatched them with feelings of the keenest anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe cunning shikaree had not come to the spot unprepared.  Having\r\nanticipated some difficulty in getting hold of the storks, he had\r\nprovidentially provided a lure, which, in the event of their proving\r\nshy, might attract them within reach of his _ringall_.  This lure was a\r\nlarge fish--which he had taken out of the larder before leaving the hut,\r\nand which he was now holding out--as conspicuously as possible, to\r\nattract their attention.  He had gone some distance apart from the\r\nothers, and especially from Fritz, whom he had scolded away from his\r\nside; and, having stationed himself on a slight eminence near the edge\r\nof the lake, he was using all his wiles to coax back the birds that had\r\nbeen so unwittingly compelled to take wing.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to Ossaroo--as well as to the others--that the flight of\r\nthe storks had been against their will; and that they had reluctantly\r\nascended into the air.  They were no doubt wearied, and wanted rest.\r\n\r\nWhether this desire would have brought them to the earth again, Ossaroo\r\ndid not stay to determine.  As soon as by their actions he became\r\nconvinced that they saw the fish held out in his hand, he flung the\r\ntempting morsel to some distance from him, and then stood awaiting the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIt proved a success--and almost instantaneously.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the appearance or attitude of Ossaroo to excite the\r\nsuspicion of the adjutants.  His dark skin and Hindoo costume were both\r\nwell-known to them; and though now observed in an odd, out-of-the-way\r\ncorner of the world, that was no reason for regarding him as an enemy.\r\n\r\nFritz was alone the object of their fear, but Fritz was a good way off,\r\nand there appeared no longer any reason for dreading him.\r\n\r\nReasoning thus--and perhaps with empty stomachs to guide them to a\r\nconclusion--the sight of the fish--lying unguarded upon the grass--put\r\nan end to their fears; and, without further hesitation, both dropped\r\ndown beside it.\r\n\r\nBoth at the same instant clutched at the coveted prize--each\r\nendeavouring to be the first in securing it.\r\n\r\nAs one of the birds had got hold of the fish by the head and the other\r\nby its tail, a struggle now arose as to which should be the first to\r\nswallow its body.  Each soon passed a portion of it down its capacious\r\nthroat, until its mandibles met in the middle, and cracked against each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAs neither would yield to the other, so neither would consent to\r\ndisgorge, and let go; and for some seconds this curious contention was\r\nkept up.\r\n\r\nHow long it might have continued was not left to the determination of\r\nthe parties themselves; but to Ossaroo, who, while they were thus\r\noccupied, rushed upon the spot; and, flinging wide his arms, enfolded\r\nboth the birds in an embrace, from which they vainly struggled to get\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of Karl and Caspar--who had in the meantime tied\r\nFritz to a tree--the huge creatures were soon overpowered, and pinioned\r\nbeyond the possibility of escaping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY.\r\n\r\nA LABELLED LEG.\r\n\r\n\"It is! it is!\" cried Karl, stooping suddenly down, and grasping the\r\nshank of one of the birds.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" inquired Caspar.\r\n\r\n\"Look, brother!  See what is there, round the stork's leg!  Do you not\r\nremember having seen that bit of jewellery before?\"\r\n\r\n\"A brass ring!  Oh yes!\" replied Caspar; \"now I do remember.  In the\r\nBotanic Gardens there was an adjutant with a ring round its ankle; a\r\nbrass ring, too--just like this one.  How very odd!\"\r\n\r\n\"Like!\" echoed Karl.  \"Not only like, but the very _same_!  Stoop down,\r\nand examine it more closely.  You see those letters?\"\r\n\r\n\"_R.B.G., Calcutta_,\" slowly pronounced Caspar, as he read the\r\ninscription graven upon the ring. \"`_R.B.G_.'  What do these initials\r\nstand for, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not difficult to tell that,\" knowingly answered Karl.  \"_Royal\r\nBotanical Garden_!  What else could it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing else.  For certain, these two birds must be the same we used to\r\nsee there, and with which we so often amused ourselves!\"\r\n\r\n\"The same,\" asserted Karl.  \"No doubt of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Fritz must have recognised them too--when he made that unprovoked\r\nattack upon them!  You remember how he used to quarrel with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.  He must not be permitted to assail them any more.  I have a use\r\nfor them.\"\r\n\r\n\"A use?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, a most important one; so important that these birds, ugly and\r\nunamiable as they are, must be cared for, as if they were the prettiest\r\nand most prized of pets.  We must provide them with food and water; we\r\nmust tend them by day, and watch over them by night--as though they were\r\nsome sacred fire, which it was our duty to keep constantly burning.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Verily, brother!  The possession of these storks is not only\r\nimportant--it is essential to our safety.  If they should die in our\r\nhands, or escape out of them--even if one of them should die or get\r\naway--we are lost.  Our last hope lies in them.  I am sure it is our\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what hope have you found in them?\" interrogated Caspar--puzzled to\r\nmake out the meaning of his brother's words, and not without wonder at\r\ntheir apparent wildness.\r\n\r\n\"Hope?  Every hope.  Ay, something more than hope: for in this singular\r\nincident I cannot fail to recognise the finger of a merciful God.\r\nSurely He hath at length taken compassion upon us!  Surely it is He who\r\nhas sent these birds!  They are messengers from Heaven!\"\r\n\r\nCaspar remained silent, gazing earnestly in the eyes of his brother,\r\nthat were now sparkling with mingled gratitude and joy.  But although\r\nCaspar could perceive this expression, he was utterly unable to\r\ninterpret it.\r\n\r\nOssaroo was alike puzzled by the strange looks and speeches of the Sahib\r\nKarl; but the Hindoo gave less heed to them--his attention being almost\r\nwholly taken up by the adjutants, which he fondled in turns--talking to\r\nthem and embracing them, as if they had been his brothers!\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cord had been looped round their ankles, and there was no\r\nlonger any danger of their getting away, Ossaroo cut up the fish into\r\nslices convenient for their gullets; and proceeded to feed them with as\r\nmuch fondness as he could have shown to a brace of human beings, who had\r\narrived from a long journey in a state of starvation.\r\n\r\nThe storks exhibited no signs of shyness--not the slightest.  It was not\r\nin their nature to do so.  They gobbled up the morsels flung before\r\nthem, with as much avidity and unconcern, as if they were being fed by\r\nthe side of the great tank in the Garden at Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThe sight of Fritz alone had a disturbing influence upon them; but, by\r\nthe command of Karl, the dog was kept out of view, until they had\r\nfinished the meal with which Ossaroo had provided them.\r\n\r\nCaspar, still in a cloud, once more interrogated the plant-hunter as to\r\nhis purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, brother!\" answered Karl, \"you are not wont to be so dull of\r\ncomprehension.  Can you not guess why I am so joyed by the presence of\r\nthese birds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I cannot--unless--\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless what?\"\r\n\r\n\"You expect them to carry a rope up the cliff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carry a rope up the cliff!  Nothing of the sort.  Yes; perhaps it is\r\nsomething of the sort.  But since you have made such a poor guess, I\r\nshall keep you in suspense a little longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, brother!--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I shall not tell you.  It is news worth guessing at; and you and\r\nOssaroo must make it out between you.\"\r\n\r\nThe two hunters, thus challenged, were about entering upon a series of\r\nconjectures, when they were interrupted by Karl.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said he, \"there is no time now.  You can exercise your ingenuity\r\nafter we have got home to the hut.  We must make sure of the storks,\r\nbefore anything else be attended to.  This cord is too slight.  They may\r\nfile it in two with their bills, and get free.  The very strongest rope\r\nwe have got will not be more than sufficient.  Come, Ossaroo, you take\r\none.  Lift it up in your arms.  I shall carry the other myself; while\r\nyou, Caspar, see to Fritz.  Lead the dog in a leash.  From this time\r\nforward he must be kept tied up--lest any misfortune should happen to\r\nspoil the best plan that has yet offered for our deliverance.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Karl flung his arms around one of the adjutants.  Ossaroo at\r\nthe same instant embraced the other; and, despite the roaring that\r\nproceeded from their throats, and the clattering made by their\r\nmandibles, the huge birds were borne home to the hut.\r\n\r\nOn arriving there, they were carried inside, and fastened with strong\r\nropes--carefully attached to their legs, and tied to the heavy beams\r\nforming the rafters of the roof.  The door was to be kept shut upon them\r\nat all times when the eyes of the captors were not watching them: for\r\nKarl, knowing the importance of having such guests, was determined to\r\nmake sure of his \"game.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY ONE.\r\n\r\nMAIL-CARRIERS ON WINGS.\r\n\r\nIt was only after they had gone back for their baskets of beans, and\r\nonce more returned to the hut, that Caspar and Ossaroo found time to\r\nindulge in their conjectures.  Then both of them set to work in\r\nearnest--seated upon the great stones outside the door, where often\r\nbefore they had conjured up schemes for their deliverance.  Neither\r\ncommunicated his thoughts to the other; each silently followed the\r\nthread of his own reflections--as if there was a rivalry between them,\r\nas to who should be the first to proclaim the design already conceived\r\nby Karl.\r\n\r\nKarl was standing close by, apparently as reflective as either of his\r\ncompanions.  But his thoughts were only occupied in bringing to\r\nperfection the plan, which to them was still undiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe storks had been brought out of the hut, and tied to a heavy log that\r\nlay near.  This had been done, partly to accustom them to the sight of\r\nthe place, and partly that they might be once more fed--the single fish\r\nthey had swallowed between them not being deemed sufficient to satisfy\r\ntheir hunger.\r\n\r\nCaspar's eyes wandered to that one that had the ring upon its leg; and\r\nthen to the ring itself--_R.B.G., Calcutta_.\r\n\r\nThe inscription at length proved suggestive to Caspar, as the ring\r\nitself, on first seeing it, had to his brother.  On that bit of brass\r\nthere was information.  It had been conveyed all the way from Calcutta\r\nby the bird that bore the shining circlet upon its shank.  By the same\r\nmeans why might not information be carried back?  Why--\r\n\r\n\"I have it!  I have it!\" shouted Caspar, without waiting to pursue the\r\nthread of conjecture that had occurred to him.  \"Yes, dear Karl, I know\r\nyour scheme--I know it; and by Jupiter Olympus, it's a capital one!\"\r\n\r\n\"So you have guessed it at last,\" rejoined Karl, rather sarcastically.\r\n\"Well, it is high time, I think!  The sight of that brass ring, with its\r\nengraved letters, should have led you to it long ago.  But come! let us\r\nhear what you have got to say, and judge whether you have guessed\r\ncorrectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly!\" assented Caspar, taking up the tone of jocular badinage\r\nin which his brother had been addressing him.  \"You intend making a\r\nchange in the character--or rather the calling--of these lately arrived\r\nguests of ours.\"  Caspar pointed to the storks.  \"That is your\r\nintention, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are now soldiers--_officers_, as their title imports--adjutants!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will have no reason to thank you for your kind intentions.  The\r\nappointment you are about to bestow on them can scarce be called a\r\npromotion.  I don't know how it may be with birds, but I do know that\r\nthere are not many men ambitious of exchanging from the military to the\r\ncivil service.\"\r\n\r\n\"What appointment, Caspar?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I'm not mistaken, you mean to make _mail-carriers_ of\r\nthem--_postmen_, if you prefer the phrase.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Karl, in a tone expressive of gratification at the\r\nclever manner in which Caspar had declared himself.  \"Right, brother!\r\nyou've guessed my scheme to the very _letter_.  That is exactly what I\r\nintend doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"By de wheeles ob Juggannaut coachee,\" cried the shikaree, who had been\r\nlistening, and understood the figurative dialogue; \"dat be da goodee\r\nplan.  Dese stork go back Calcutt--surely dey go back.  Dey carry letter\r\nto Feringhee Sahibs--Sahibs dey know we here in prison--dey come d'liva\r\nwe vey dey affer get de letter--ha! ha! ha!\"  Then _delivering_ himself\r\nof a series of shrill ejaculations, the Hindoo sprang up from the stone\r\nupon which he had been sitting, and danced around the hut, as if he had\r\nsuddenly taken leave of his senses!\r\n\r\nHowever imperfectly spoken, the words of Ossaroo had disclosed the whole\r\nplan, as conceived by the plant-hunter himself.\r\n\r\nIt had vaguely defined itself in Karl's mind, on first seeing the storks\r\nabove him in the air; but when the lustre of metal flashed before his\r\neyes, and he perceived that yellow band encircling the shank of the\r\nbird, the scheme became more definite and plausible.\r\n\r\nWhen at length the storks were taken captive, and Karl deciphered the\r\ninscription--by which they were identified as old acquaintances of the\r\nR.B.G.--he no longer doubted that Providence was in the plot; and that\r\nthese winged messengers had been sent, as it were, from Heaven itself,\r\nto deliver him and his companions from that prison in which they had so\r\nlong been pining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY TWO.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThe deliverance came at length; though it was not immediate.  Several\r\nmonths more, of that lonely and monotonous life, were our adventurers\r\ncalled upon to endure.\r\n\r\nThey had to wait for the return of the rainy season; when the rivers\r\nthat traverse the great plains of Hindostan became brimful of flood--\r\nbearing upon their turbid bosoms that luxuriance, not of life, but of\r\ndeath, which attracts the crane and the stork once more to seek\r\nsubsistence upon their banks.  Then the great adjutant returns from his\r\nsummer tour to the north--winging his way southward over the lofty\r\nsummits of Imaus.  Then, too, did Karl and his comrades believe that\r\n_their adjutants_ would be guided by a like instinct, and go back to the\r\nR.B.G.--the Royal Botanic Garden of Calcutta.\r\n\r\nKarl felt confident of their doing so, as certain almost as if he had\r\nstood on the banks of the sacred stream in the R.B.G. itself, and saw\r\nthem descending from their aerial flight and alighting within the\r\nenclosure.  This confidence arose from the remembrance of his having\r\nheard--while sojourning with the Curator--that such had been their habit\r\nfor many years; and that the time, both of their departure and arrival,\r\nwas so periodically regular, that there was not an employe of the place\r\nwho could not tell it to a day!\r\n\r\nFortunately, Karl remembered the time, though not the exact day.  He\r\nknew the week, however, in which his guests might be expected to take\r\ntheir departure; and this was enough for his purpose.\r\n\r\nDuring their stay in the valley the birds had been cared for, as if they\r\nhad been sacred to some deity, adored by those who held them in charge.\r\n\r\nFish and flesh had they a plenty--with Ossaroo as their provider.  Food\r\nand drink, whenever they stood in need of either; freedom from\r\nannoyance, and protection from enemies of every kind--even from Fritz,\r\nwho had long since ceased to be their enemy.  Nothing had been wanting\r\nto their comfort; everything had been granted--everything but their\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThis, too, was at length restored to them.\r\n\r\nOn a fair morning--such as a bird might have chosen for its highest\r\nflight--both were set free to go whithersoever they listed.\r\n\r\nThe only obstruction to their flight was a pair of small skin sacks, one\r\nattached to the neck of each, and prudently placed beyond the reach of\r\nits mandibles.  Both were furnished with this curiously-contrived bag;\r\nfor Karl--as the spare leaves of his memorandum-book enabled him to do--\r\nhad determined that each should be entrusted with a letter and lest one\r\nshould go astray, he had sent his _despatch in duplicate_.\r\n\r\nFor a time the birds seemed reluctant to leave those kind companions--\r\nwho had so long fed and cherished them; but the instinct that urged them\r\nto seek the sunny plains of the South at length prevailed; and, giving a\r\n_scream_ of adieu--reciprocated by the encouraging shouts of those they\r\nwere leaving behind, and a prolonged baying from the throat of the\r\nboar-hound Fritz--they soared aloft into the air; and in slow, solemn\r\nflight ascended the cliff--soon to disappear behind the crest of the\r\nencircling ridge.\r\n\r\nTen days after, on that same cliff stood a score of men--a glad sight to\r\nKarl, Caspar, and Ossaroo.  Even Fritz barked with joy as he beheld\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nAgainst the blue background of the sky, it could be perceived that these\r\nmen carried coils of rope, pieces of wood, and other implements that\r\nmight be required for scaling a cliff.\r\n\r\nOur adventurers now knew, that, one or other, or both copies of their\r\nduplicate despatch, must have reached the destination for which they had\r\ndesigned it.\r\n\r\nAnd the same destination was soon after reached by themselves.  By the\r\nhelp of their rescuers, and the long rope-ladders which they let down,\r\nall three succeeded in _climbing the cliff_--Fritz making the ascent\r\nupon the shoulders of the shikaree!\r\n\r\nAll three, amidst a company of delighted deliverers--with Fritz\r\nfollowing at their heels--once more descended the southern slope of the\r\nHimalayas; once more stood upon the banks of the sacred Ganges; once\r\nmore entered within the hospitable gates of the R.B.G.--there to renew\r\ntheir acquaintance, not only with hospitable friends, but with those\r\nwinged messengers, by whose instrumentality they had been delivered from\r\ntheir living tomb, and once more restored to society and the world!\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Cliff Climbers, by Captain Mayne Reid",
