JEFFERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nHomesteading days are here again. The present movement of people back to\r\nthe land is of a different type and has different objectives from those\r\nwhich prevailed when a continent was to be conquered and exploited. Today\r\nwe know that many urban industries will operate on a seasonal basis and we\r\nknow too that periods of unemployment and shorter working days will\r\nprovide more leisure and probably lower incomes for hundreds of thousands\r\nof families. The utilization of this leisure time to supplement incomes,\r\nto raise the standards of living and of health, and to attain some measure\r\nof economic security will tend more and more to settlement on the land.\r\n\r\nIn these days of rapid transportation and all the attributes and\r\nconveniences of modern country life, the hardships of the earlier period\r\nof land development are non-existent. Although urban industrial\r\ndevelopment has reached a point which will not be exceeded for many years\r\nto come, the individual who needs additional income may adjust himself to\r\nsuch circumstances by establishing a country homestead. Industrial\r\nactivity is tending to decentralize, largely as the result of widespread\r\npower distribution, and a home in the country accessible to some form of\r\nmanufacturing or business employment offers undeniable attractions.\r\n\r\nThis book is prepared primarily for the family that is inexperienced in\r\ncountry living and in soil culture. Such a family should know about the\r\nnature of the soil on which it lives, how to make it serve the family's\r\nneeds and purposes, what to do, and what to avoid in order that success\r\nmay be attained and failure averted. Students of agriculture as a vocation\r\nand practical farmers may find, beyond the elementary facts presented,\r\ninformation of value and help to them. To know and to understand the\r\nscience and practice of agriculture is to have power to cope with and to\r\nenjoy soil culture and animal husbandry. If this little volume helps to\r\nanswer clearly and definitely the many inquiries that are in the minds of\r\nprospective and active homesteaders, it will have served its purpose.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of many practical people and the resources of agricultural\r\ninstitutions and agencies have been drawn upon for this book. Grateful\r\nacknowledgment is made to those who have contributed constructive\r\ncriticism and have helped in the preparation of material. Especial credit\r\nis due to the personnel of the New Jersey and New York colleges of\r\nagriculture and to my associates in the New Jersey Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM B.

The early settlers\r\ntilled the soil and derived from it the simple things that they needed.\r\nNecessity compelled them to be self-reliant, courageous and resourceful.\r\nThe establishment of a home in early days meant the clearing of land, the\r\nerection of a house for human habitation and the building of shelters for\r\na few farm animals. Each farm home became practically self-sufficient so\r\nfar as the family needs were concerned. Clothing was made there for each\r\nmember of the family. After clearing and subduing the land, the settlers\r\nwere able to produce their cereal foods. Animals were slaughtered and the\r\nmeat processed to provide sustenance throughout the year. Through the\r\nexchange of commodities and ideas with neighbors, advances in living\r\nconditions were made.\r\n\r\nThe family that was not resourceful in those days failed to survive.\r\nNeighbors were too busy working out their own existence problems to\r\nsuccor the incompetent. Resourcefulness was called upon in meeting\r\nonslaughts of beasts or human marauders. Thus there was built up a\r\ntradition of seeking and utilizing resources that has gone on to make our\r\ncountry great and the wonder of the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nSince pioneer days we have built a great industrial, commercial and\r\nfinancial machine. American inventive genius, coupled with the best brains\r\nof the civilized world, attracted by resources and opportunities on every\r\nhand, has invaded every field and created a great industrial\r\nsuperstructure.\r\n\r\nWith the genesis and development of a great industrial era in the United\r\nStates there started a movement of population from farms to established\r\ncenters of population. The application of the sciences to the problems of\r\nfilling human wants gave this movement greater impetus. Mining and the\r\nrefining of metal ores, the exploiting of coal deposits, the building of\r\nrailroads, the construction of buildings for business and residential\r\npurposes, as well as dozens of other great enterprises, served to draw\r\nfrom the country the best of its human resources.\r\n\r\nInventive genius began to concentrate on the solution of engineering and\r\nconstruction problems created by congestion of population and successive\r\nsteps in industrialization. This same technical genius was applied also to\r\nfarm operations which required laborious effort by men and work animals.\r\nThat this development itself progressed rapidly is demonstrated by the\r\nfact that while in 1810 the effort of nearly every person was required to\r\nproduce enough food to sustain the population, in 1910 the efforts of\r\none-third of the people were sufficient to provide food for the nation and\r\nexport vast quantities to other countries.\r\n\r\nWhile the nation continued to grow rapidly in population and sought to\r\napply to ordinary practices the newer labor-saving devices, all was well.\r\nIt was inevitable, however, that the great industrial machine should\r\nbecome over-developed, at least temporarily. Instead of machinery being a\r\nservant of mankind it became an octopus that could not be checked.\r\nIndividual initiative, the wellspring of earlier developments in the\r\nprocess, became atrophied. There came about such a high degree of\r\nspecialization in human effort as to make men dependent upon others for\r\nwork to do. Consequently, even a slight throwing out of gear of the\r\nmachine created unemployment, which reduced buying power for the\r\nmachine-made products and started a vicious downward spiral accompanied by\r\nevery form of economic distress.\r\n\r\nWhen such partial or complete breakdown of the superstructure occurs,\r\nthoughtful people are brought \"down to earth,\" both collectively and very\r\nintimately in thousands of individual cases. They begin to get back to\r\nfundamentals and to seek means of becoming so reestablished as to avoid\r\nfuture cataclysms. The family attracted to the city by the lure of high\r\nindustrial wages and by crowded avenues finds in such a breakdown that it\r\nhas lost its moorings.\r\n\r\nIn seeking means of reestablishment free of the terrifying complications\r\nof industrial life, the mind turns to the country, to the soil, to growing\r\nthings that are not visibly affected by economic cycles. The open country\r\nseems ready to welcome back her errant children graciously and to enfold\r\nthem within her protecting bosom. We cannot go back, however, to pioneer\r\ndays. Free land is not available and we have not the arts or the patience\r\nto practice the means of livelihood of those days. To make the new or\r\nrenewed relationship with the soil a success, it is necessary to\r\nunderstand that country life, too, has changed during industrial\r\nrevolutions. Mother Earth is now, as ever, a generous but exacting parent.\r\nTo try to reestablish relationships in a blind and haphazard manner is\r\nlikely to lead to further disaster. Such a debacle is quite needless,\r\nprovided some fundamental principles and practices are understood and\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, the open country is now making the greatest appeal as a\r\nplace of residence that it has made at any time in the history of the\r\nnation. To list the conveniences which now exist in the country is to\r\nduplicate those which many people have considered as available only in\r\ncities. In most areas of the country, for example, there are daily mail\r\ndelivery, telephone service, some measure of fire protection, and\r\ntransportation by automobile, bus or train. It is quite possible, for\r\nexample, to step into a bus at one's dooryard and be carried to any part\r\nof the United States by the same method of transportation.\r\n\r\nThe development of the radio has brought to the country home all the\r\nsurging activities of national life and varied educational and\r\nentertainment programs. The spread of electric light and power lines\r\nthrough the country constitutes a boon that makes possible the use of all\r\nkinds of electrical appliances known in the city, including refrigerators,\r\ncooking ranges, washing machines, water pumps, water heaters and hundreds\r\nof other machines and appliances, some of which are in their infancy. No\r\ngreat difficulty is experienced in locating in the open country where such\r\nelectrical facilities are available.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy U. S. Department of Agriculture_)\r\n\r\nAn attractive farmstead offering requisites of a home in the open\r\ncountry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy U. S. Department of Agriculture_)\r\n\r\nFloor plan of house shown on opposite page.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the main highways in the northern sections of the country a heavy fall\r\nof snow used to mean isolation for weeks. Today the snow is removed as\r\nrapidly as it falls, and these highways are kept open. The problems and\r\nperils of isolation are thus removed.\r\n\r\nTradesmen of all kinds are directing their sales toward country homes, and\r\nsupplies of ice and all kinds of food can be obtained almost daily at the\r\nfarm doorstep. There is also a tendency to develop factories in the\r\ncountry away from the high-rent areas of cities and to utilize the\r\nservices of persons living in the vicinity of the factory for full or\r\npartial time in the plants. The cost of living can be reduced by living in\r\nthe country, and opportunities for purchasing foods and other products at\r\nwholesale prices and storing them against the time of need make further\r\neconomies possible.\r\n\r\nThe greatest asset that the country has to offer relates to the health and\r\ncharacter of those who live close to nature. It has long been recognized\r\nby many European countries that the ownership of even a small tract of\r\nland, no larger than a city lot, perhaps, is a definite asset in building\r\na nation and in building individual character. In Germany, in Denmark and\r\nin many other nations, the government lends its aid toward the\r\nestablishment of people in the country and makes it possible for them to\r\nacquire and retain small holdings of land which they may call \"home.\" It\r\nis on these small tracts that one sees veritable bowers of pastoral\r\nindustry and beauty.\r\n\r\nResidence in the open country, in contact with the soil, contributes to\r\nphysical strength and to mental health. When a man lives in the country,\r\nhis house, his way of living and his contribution to the community stand\r\nout where all may see them. These latter assets have always been inherent\r\nin country life. When to these are added the conveniences and the\r\nopportunities for community enjoyment that are now a part of rural life,\r\nits appeal is not difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nAnyone who intends to live in the country has his individual problems to\r\nmeet and to solve. In the solution of these problems there are many\r\nresources and avenues to which he may turn in the present day for help and\r\nfor guidance. The tragic mistakes that have been made in the past can and\r\nshould be largely eliminated in the future. A clearer understanding should\r\nbe gained as to what one may obtain in the country in the form of a better\r\nway of living, serving as an anchor to the windward even under favorable\r\neconomic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ II\r\n\r\nGETTING ESTABLISHED IN THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the selection of a residence in the country, the settler must decide\r\nwhether he wishes to locate on a farm of considerable acreage or whether\r\nhe wants to have a relatively small tract ranging from 2 to 15 acres. In\r\nthe latter case, he is thinking primarily of a place of residence with\r\nsufficient acreage to make it possible to secure a partial living from the\r\nland immediately surrounding the home. The trend in such purchases is\r\ntoward the smaller place for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\nA large farm acquired by a relatively inexperienced person means a very\r\nconsiderable burden in the development and maintenance of the land itself\r\non a producing basis. Capital is required for the purchase of equipment\r\nand power. Parts of the land may need to be drained, and taxes must be\r\npaid whether the land is productive or not. A person acquiring a farm of\r\n50 or more acres will find that the major portion of his time, thought and\r\ncapital will be called upon to make it a success. If he has definitely\r\ncut off his city connections and the idea of having a job there, and has\r\nhad experience in farming, then he may be in a position to take over a\r\nlarge acreage so that his full time and possibly that of other members of\r\nhis family can be spent on various projects on the land he acquires.\r\n\r\nWe are here primarily concerned, not with those who desire to enter upon\r\nfarming on a large scale, but with the family which would like to live in\r\nthe country, secure a partial living from the land surrounding the home\r\nand still have the opportunity of gaining a livelihood from some\r\nindustrial or commercial activity located in a near-by city or town. It is\r\nquite likely that we shall have a shorter working week and probably\r\nperiods of unemployment for hundreds of thousands of ambitious people.\r\nTherefore, a place in the country that is well located with respect to\r\nhard-surfaced highways and accessible to urban centers offers\r\nopportunities for combining the advantages and economic assets of country\r\nlife with urban employment.\r\n\r\n_Getting Started Right._--Too much emphasis cannot be laid upon getting\r\nthe right start, particularly with respect to location. This is not only\r\nessential for the satisfaction of the present occupant of the premises,\r\nbut also gives definite sales value in case circumstances make a change\r\nof location desirable or necessary.\r\n\r\nIt will often appear that the best location is on the outskirts of a city\r\nor town and from some angles this is good reasoning. There are some\r\nfactors, however, that make such a location undesirable. For one thing,\r\nthe tax rate is likely to be higher in such areas than in the open\r\ncountry, thus adding to overhead without compensating advantages. In the\r\nsecond place, urban centers develop without regard to soil type and this\r\nis an essential factor to the family that expects to engage in some\r\nagricultural pursuit. Again, the type of inhabitants that live on the\r\nfringe of towns and cities may not make good neighbors or associates for\r\nchildren, especially. None of these disadvantages may be present in\r\nlocations close to centers of population, but the prospective settler\r\nshould give all these factors full consideration. The sales argument\r\nfrequently advanced that such locations will grow in value due to growth\r\nof population may be fallacious.\r\n\r\nMany have found that the higher costs of living in these areas often\r\nprevent the owner from holding on until the slow growth of population\r\noutward makes a worth-while profit possible from his real estate.\r\nFurthermore, the growth of cities and towns is definitely slowing down.\r\nThe expansion of city areas is greatly curtailed and is not likely to be\r\nresumed soon.\r\n\r\nThe most important time to get expert opinion as to location is at the\r\nbeginning and not after purchasing. There are available in every locality\r\npersons whose advice is useful in such matters. The county agricultural\r\nagent located in nearly every county seat knows the countryside and his\r\nadvice on the subject of definite location should be sought once one has\r\ndecided upon the general area which seems attractive. In determining on\r\nspecific location the bank which has a clientele in the country will often\r\nbe found a helpful guide through suggestions or through ability to refer\r\nthe questioner to reputable and informed persons with more definite\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAnother source of information is the local dealer in farm supplies. He\r\nwill be found to know general soil types in the vicinity, especially those\r\ntypes which bring business to him because they are productive. Owners of\r\nsuch land are able to buy and use to advantage the supplies he has to\r\noffer to the grower.\r\n\r\n_Size of Tract._--There is the possibility that a person who goes back to\r\nthe land may acquire too little land as well as too much. Inadequate land\r\nresources may seriously hinder possibilities of revenue from the place and\r\ncramp facilities for his enterprises. In this connection it may be\r\nhelpful to point out that an acre of land comprises 43,560 square feet. A\r\ncity lot measuring 50 by 100 feet contains 5,000 square feet. An acre\r\ntherefore would comprise about eight and one-half such city lots. A 5-acre\r\ntract is usually a minimum area for a small agricultural enterprise and\r\nmany have found it entirely adequate.\r\n\r\nThe size of the tract to be acquired and the enterprises that can be\r\nengaged in will depend in considerable measure upon the size of the\r\noccupant's family--whether they can assist in its operation and whether\r\nthe owner himself intends to put in all or only a part of his time. The\r\npossibility of securing extra labor should also be looked into before\r\nlarger operations are attempted. No definite formula can be set down for\r\ndesirable area and enterprises in relation to time available for\r\noperating. However, the owner will realize that one pair of hands can do\r\nonly so much work. To try to operate beyond the capacity of his own time\r\nand that of others available is to become involved in striving to keep up\r\nwith exigencies that may make country life a struggle instead of a\r\npleasurable existence. It may result, too, in losses due to inability to\r\nget things done on time, and nature deals harshly with those who neglect\r\nthe seasonable operations that come in any agricultural enterprise.\r\n\"Bulling through\" or skimping or cutting corners simply will not work when\r\none is dealing with plant and animal life and only failure will come to\r\nhim who undertakes to bluff nature.\r\n\r\nThe successful operator of a farming endeavor must always be on top of his\r\nwork, that is, able to plan and direct his energies in the most productive\r\nway at the right time. This is really managing and is likely to lead to\r\nsuccess and satisfaction. To have so much to do that one emergency after\r\nanother must be met brings the operator down under his farming projects.\r\nHe ceases to manage under these conditions and becomes driven by his own\r\ncreations. To avoid this unhappy state, which is entirely unnecessary,\r\nplanning must be effectively done and operations undertaken in a gradual\r\nway up to one's capacity.\r\n\r\n_Cost of Land._--The price one should pay for land in a relatively small\r\ntract cannot be arbitrarily fixed. Those who own large farms or tracts\r\nexpect to receive a bonus for the acres located along a highway as\r\ncompared with an average price for the entire place. It should be possible\r\nto buy a 5- or 10-acre tract of land in the open country with highway\r\nfrontage for from $150 to $250 an acre, depending on location. If the land\r\nis located near town or city where speculative operations have enhanced\r\nvalues, the cost will be considerably more. Where an entire farm is\r\ndesired, the buildings are frequently given no value, the cost being the\r\nprice of the land only. As has been stated, it is quite possible to\r\nacquire too much land as well as too little. A few acres selected from a\r\ntract of good, productive soil will usually be found a better investment\r\nthan a large farm that has been abandoned because of lack of fertility.\r\n\r\n_Accessibility to Cities._--In deciding upon the location of a farm,\r\nmethods of transportation that are available are as important as nearness\r\nto cities. A location near a railroad station offers the possibility of\r\nlow commutation rates to a point of industrial or commercial employment. A\r\nlocation abutting upon an improved highway means that transportation by\r\nbus or by personally owned automobile can be utilized at the least expense\r\nand trouble the year round. The recent development of bus lines covering\r\nalmost every main artery of travel offers facilities for quick and\r\neconomical transportation unknown to country residents even a few years\r\nago. Furthermore, the selection of a place of residence accessible to\r\ntransportation to and from it is a factor to be borne in mind in\r\nconnection with the possible resale of the property, should that at any\r\ntime be desirable or necessary.\r\n\r\n_The Soil._--The type of soil is a highly important factor in determining\r\nupon location; also important is its crop-producing capacity. For all\r\ngeneral purposes, a soil which is loamy in texture is desirable. Types to\r\nbe avoided are the extremes of clay and sand. A heavy clay soil,\r\nparticularly where the land is in a depression, not only inhibits plant\r\ngrowth of all kinds but is often undesirable as a place of residence from\r\nthe standpoint of healthfulness. A condition of extreme muddiness in wet\r\nweather creates an unpleasant reaction on those forced to live near it. On\r\nthe other hand, areas which are so sandy in character as to furnish no\r\nfertility for the growth of plants will be found undesirable in making the\r\nsurroundings of the home attractive and in growing the vegetables and\r\nfruits which should constitute a part of the living.\r\n\r\nOne method of judging the soil consists of examining the vegetation that\r\nis already growing upon it and determining on that basis whether it is\r\nlikely to be favorable for the growth of desirable plants. For this\r\nreason, the selection of a site during the growing season is recommended,\r\nrather than during a dormant season when it is difficult to form an\r\nestimate of the vegetation that the soil will support.\r\n\r\n_Availability of Electricity._--While it is possible to secure individual\r\nelectrical generating plants, it is far preferable to establish a home\r\nwhere electric lines may be tapped. The obtaining of electrical energy\r\nfrom a commercial line is desirable because of its greater dependability,\r\ngenerally lower cost and the fact that unlimited use of electricity may be\r\nobtained without the overloading that frequently occurs where individual\r\nplants are set up. Probably the availability of public utility lines is\r\nthe greatest asset of comfortable country life and one of the most\r\nimportant factors in creating genuine resale value. These lines bring to\r\nthe country dweller most of the advantages that are enjoyed by city\r\nresidents. This is true not only because of the advantages of electric\r\nlights, but also because electricity makes possible the use of such modern\r\nappurtenances to the home as electric refrigerators, washers, radios,\r\nwater pumps and various devices and machines for use in connection with\r\npoultry keeping and vegetable growing.\r\n\r\n_Type of Buildings._--Especial attention should be given to the\r\nadaptability to the buyer's needs of the residence and the other buildings\r\nthat may already be in existence. If the plot being considered is on a\r\nmain highway, it is highly desirable to have the residence located back\r\nfrom the highway a hundred feet or more as a means of eliminating noise\r\nand promoting safety especially if children are in the family. The\r\nlocation of a home directly on one of the main arteries of traffic\r\ndestroys many of the advantages of country life, owing to the distracting\r\nnoises that accompany intensive truck and passenger traffic.\r\n\r\nThe age of buildings and their previous care have a direct relation to\r\ntheir value, particularly if they are of frame construction. If the\r\nbuildings have been standing for a number of years, full allowance must be\r\nmade for depreciation and repairs incident to weathering and long usage.\r\nThe actual investment represented in a building erected under war or\r\npost-war conditions may not be in line with present values. In measuring\r\nthe value of the principal buildings that are already on a tract, careful\r\nconsideration should be given to the cost of replacement. Consideration\r\nshould be given also to the outbuildings that may be on such a place.\r\nInstead of being an asset to the property, they may be a distinct\r\nliability if they are not directly useful to the intending purchaser. From\r\nthe standpoint of economy of maintenance and generally good appearance, it\r\nis much better to have one building serve a number of purposes than to\r\nhave a number on different parts of the property, adding to the cost of\r\nmaintenance and multiplying steps.\r\n\r\n_Educational Facilities._--Where there are children in the family, the\r\nlocation of schools and the facilities which they offer should be\r\ninvestigated by the prospective buyer. It is desirable to locate as near\r\nto schools as possible. In recent years there has been a strong tendency\r\nthroughout the country to do away with local schools and to consolidate\r\neducational facilities in one building. Coupled with this trend is the\r\nfree transportation of pupils to consolidated schools. Therefore, it is\r\nhighly important to locate either near a school which will be kept in\r\noperation or where transportation facilities are available to and from the\r\nhome and the school. It should be said that the trend toward consolidation\r\nof schools has carried with it great benefits to children who live in the\r\nopen country by affording them educational facilities that are not\r\nexceeded by most city schools.\r\n\r\n_Community Advantages._--The community, in addition to educational\r\nfacilities that are available, should include those opportunities that\r\nappeal especially to the family. The accessibility of the church of one's\r\npreference should not be overlooked, and the general type of community\r\nlife is highly important too. Some communities are known for the\r\nlaw-abiding proclivities of their residents while others do not have a\r\nsavory reputation from the standpoint of the peace and security of their\r\nmore respectable inhabitants. One should establish a residence in the\r\ncommunity with the thought that he is to become a factor in the life of\r\nthat community. He should be sure that there is a genuine spirit of\r\nhealthy and cooperative activity which constantly tends to upbuild the\r\nneighborhood, by keeping out or suppressing undesirable elements and by\r\ndeveloping a concerted feeling of responsibility for the welfare of all\r\nwho live within its boundaries.\r\n\r\nA resident of a city moving to the country frequently finds a difference\r\nin his neighbors' viewpoint that surprises him. There is, and must be, in\r\nthe rural community a closer relationship between the people in that\r\ncommunity than ever exists in an apartment dwelling in the city. In the\r\ncountry, one's neighbors are apt to show a surprising amount of friendly\r\ninterest in one's doings, since the whole trend of the community is based\r\nupon the actions and attitude of the relatively few people who live within\r\nit. It should be repeated, therefore, that the type of community and the\r\nfacilities which the people of that community have developed should be\r\ngiven careful attention by the prospective resident and he should\r\ndetermine for himself whether the particular community that he has in\r\nmind is in accord with his ideas and ideals. To be out of step with the\r\ncommunity in which one lives is apt to create dissatisfactions and a\r\ncritical attitude on both sides that is not conducive to happiness.\r\n\r\nA home in the country has more of the attributes of genuine ownership than\r\nhas a home anywhere else. The country home must be established with an\r\nidea of permanence and of becoming really rooted in the soil where one\r\nlocates, if the true benefits of rural home ownership are to be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do's_\r\n\r\nDecide either on large farm or on house and small acreage.\r\n\r\nDetermine accessibility at all times of the year.\r\n\r\nPurchase soil of loam texture, mixture of sand and clay.\r\n\r\nDetermine whether electricity is available.\r\n\r\nLocate back from highway.\r\n\r\nIf present buildings are to be used, be sure of their condition and need\r\nof repair.\r\n\r\nFind out type and accessibility of schools and other community buildings.\r\n\r\nPrepare to be _of_ the community as well as _in_ it.\r\n\r\nRemember there are advantages of small tract over large farm where\r\navailable time is an important element.\r\n\r\nUse local sources of information as to desirability of tract before\r\npurchasing.\r\n\r\nWork out a plan of management that fits into the time available for the\r\nfarm duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don'ts_\r\n\r\nDon't overlook intrinsic values of the location, such as soil, low tax\r\nrate and good neighbors.\r\n\r\nAvoid excessive capital outlay.\r\n\r\nAvoid extra heavy or extra sandy soils or evidently unproductive ones.\r\n\r\nDon't overlook advantages of electric light and power.\r\n\r\nDon't buy a place just because it has buildings. They may not be adapted\r\nto your needs.\r\n\r\nDon't buy too much land. It can be a burden.\r\n\r\nDon't let the farm become your master.\r\n\r\nDon't pay too much for land. There is plenty of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ III\r\n\r\nFINANCING AND PROTECTING THE INVESTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquiring land for residence and for subsistence calls for the exercise of\r\ngood business judgment. Not only must the site and general location be\r\nacceptable to the family, but the investment involved should be within the\r\ncapacity of the owner to finance without undue strain on his resources. It\r\nshould be recognized that there will be ordinary living expenses to be met\r\nin the country and perhaps some extraordinary demands resulting from\r\nemergencies. Consequently, adequate thought and preparation must be made\r\nfor financing the investment and making sure, as far as that is possible,\r\nthat the investment in a country home will not be lost through inability\r\nto meet possible contingencies.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the capital investment should be kept as low\r\nas possible. Wherever feasible, the cash available should take care of the\r\nfull investment without the necessity for additional financing. This\r\nreduces the drain upon resources through obviating the necessity of\r\nmeeting interest payments on mortgages and makes possible the use of any\r\nsurplus funds for improvement, for education and for giving the family the\r\nadvantages which country life offers. If it is necessary to borrow funds\r\nfor financing the purchase, special attention should be given to the type\r\nof mortgage which is obtained.\r\n\r\n_Mortgage Financing._--One of the most desirable types of financing is\r\nthrough a financially sound building and loan association whereby the\r\ninterest and the amortization of the mortgage are taken care of through\r\nmonthly payments. Such building and loan mortgages are available in most\r\nlocalities throughout the country. A series of monthly payments can be\r\nmade which will take care of the interest payments and the mortgage itself\r\nso that within a period of from ten to twelve years, in most cases, the\r\nmortgage is amortized and the owner has the advantages of a home that is\r\nfree of encumbrance. For example, if the mortgage amounts to $3,000,\r\nsubscription to fifteen shares of a building and loan association at $1 a\r\nshare per month would make it possible to clear off the mortgage in about\r\neleven years. This would call for the payment to the association of $15\r\nper month and interest. Through the compounding of interest, the mortgage\r\ncan be lifted at less expense than any other procedure.\r\n\r\nAnother satisfactory plan is to place the mortgage with a bank or\r\nfinancing company or insurance company that will not call the mortgage so\r\nlong as the payments are met, and at the same time start saving through a\r\nbuilding and loan association so as to complete the payments over a series\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nThere is a far greater sense of security in having no mortgage or in\r\nsetting up a definite and practical procedure for eliminating it than in\r\nalways having a mortgage encumbrance with its interest payments and the\r\npossibility of having it called at an inopportune moment. A home that is\r\nfree from mortgage can be carried at small cost, especially where the\r\nowner is willing to make most of the repairs and attend to the upkeep\r\nhimself. The demand for outlay of cash for mortgage interest may be\r\nfinancially embarrassing, especially where income is not guaranteed or may\r\nbe jeopardized through a drastic reduction at critical periods or as the\r\nresult of emergency expenses in the family, such as are entailed by\r\nserious illness.\r\n\r\n_Taxes._--One of the factors that is frequently overlooked in the purchase\r\nof a residence in the country is the cost of meeting taxes. Since taxes\r\nmust be met if the property is to be held, it is highly important that\r\nthe location be one in which tax rates are not excessive. On the other\r\nhand, an exceedingly low tax rate may indicate lack of progressiveness in\r\nthe community and lack of facilities which from many angles would lessen\r\nthe value of the tract as a place of residence. In most localities, the\r\ntax rate is based principally upon the costs of building and maintaining\r\nhighways and schools. Good facilities in both of these respects are highly\r\ndesirable, and yet excessive expenditures in either direction may so\r\nadvance the tax rate as to make them expensive luxuries.\r\n\r\nIn many rural communities, taxing districts are burdened with the costs of\r\nbuilding monumental schools or a very elaborate system of roads,\r\nundertaken at some time through the flotation of bond issues. The\r\nestablishment of a sinking fund for payment of interest and amortization\r\nof these bonds frequently constitutes a very heavy drain upon the\r\nresidents of the district. It is, therefore, necessary to determine not\r\nonly the tax rate in the locality under consideration, but also to know\r\ndefinitely what are the current charges for maintenance of government.\r\nTaxing methods vary so widely, even in adjoining districts, that the only\r\nmethod of determining the annual charges for taxes is to secure from the\r\npresent owner or from the local tax assessor the definite payments that\r\nmust be made.\r\n\r\nAs a means of saving trouble later, an investigation should be made of the\r\nproperty under consideration to make sure that taxes have been paid to the\r\ndate of purchase. This is distinctly the obligation of the owner. Unpaid\r\ntaxes constitute a lien on the property, and an investigation of the\r\nstatus of the tax payments is essential in protecting the proposed\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n_The Title and Survey._--A great deal of possible trouble can be\r\neliminated by making sure that the title is clear. An investigation should\r\nbe made along this line by an attorney or agency equipped to secure\r\ninformation from appropriate county offices. Very often the owner has had\r\na recent search made and is willing to pass this on to the purchaser, thus\r\nsaving expense and delay in tracing back the records over a long period of\r\nyears. Such study will show whether there are encumbrances or liens of any\r\nkind on the property, and these, of course, must be cleared up before any\r\ntransaction is entered into.\r\n\r\nThe potential buyer should also have a survey made by a competent engineer\r\nto definitely fix the boundaries of the property. Stakes can then be\r\nplaced, indicating the corners and any irregularities in the outline of\r\nthe area under consideration, showing the new owner exactly where his\r\nproperty extends. In many sections of the country the buyer is in a\r\nposition to demand of the owner that such a survey be made at the owner's\r\nexpense. This survey is particularly important where an area of\r\nconsiderable size has been cut up into parcels for sale to individuals.\r\n\r\nThe steps that have been outlined to protect the investment are only those\r\nwhich a prudent purchaser will insist upon before transfer of ownership\r\ntakes place. Frequently a buyer becomes so enamored with a property that\r\nhe hopes nothing will interfere with his acquisition of it, and he is apt\r\nto mentally minimize the possibilities of a cloud on the title or the\r\nexactness of the property lines. So many people have suffered serious\r\nlosses from failure to look thoroughly before leaping that emphasis is\r\ngiven to these points as a means of securing ample protection for the\r\nbuyer.\r\n\r\n_An Income from the Investment._--It is presumed that in most cases the\r\nowner of even a small tract expects to secure some financial returns from\r\nthe land as a means of adding to his income. The plan that is proposed as\r\na means of securing an income from the land should not be too complicated\r\nand should be of a type that can be carried on when the owner is\r\nnecessarily engaged in other work. This, of course, may run the gamut from\r\na small home garden to supply the vegetable needs of the household to the\r\noperation of a larger tract on a commercial basis. Furthermore, as we get\r\ninto the commercial type of production, that may be planned as a means of\r\nmaterially supplementing an income or eventually supplying the entire\r\nfamily income.\r\n\r\nEspecial attention has been given in recent years to the use of poultry as\r\na means of supplying an income to the family which is willing to use its\r\nown resources for taking care of the flock. Another means of securing an\r\nincome is the growing of vegetables and the sale of these vegetables at a\r\nstand erected near the house for the convenience of the traveling public.\r\nMany who engage in vegetable growing or egg production on a relatively\r\nsmall scale will find an outlet for their products through associates in\r\nsome other line of work, who will be glad to buy from their country\r\nfriends on the basis of quality and freshness that may not be obtainable\r\nthrough their community stores.\r\n\r\nIt should be pointed out that where the area under cultivation is small,\r\nthe production must be intensive. In other words, it would be uneconomic\r\nfor the owner of a small tract to try to supplement his income through the\r\ngrowth of staple crops. He must specialize in some particular phase of\r\nagriculture, horticulture or animal industry that will bring the largest\r\npossible net returns per acre even though that implies a considerably\r\nlarger labor cost per unit of operation than would be the case in the\r\ngrowing of the staple crops, such as the cereals. The successful\r\nproduction of vegetable crops or poultry products, for example, and their\r\nsuccessful merchandizing, rest primarily on the interest and the\r\nadaptability of the individual.\r\n\r\n_Avoiding Causes of Failure._--To know what procedures to avoid is to be\r\nfortified against failure and to be prepared to take advantage of those\r\nconstructive measures which are conducive to success. A recent survey has\r\nbeen made in an eastern state on the causes of failure in farming,\r\nfrequently followed by necessitous abandonment of the farm and home. This\r\nsurvey shows that one of the principal causes of failure is the effort to\r\nmanage a farm that is too large for the operator's capacity; his\r\ninexperience and lack of knowledge constitute too great a handicap on a\r\nlarge acreage. Best results can be secured in farming only by seeding,\r\ncultivating and harvesting at the proper time in each case. To a greater\r\nextent than is usually realized, success depends upon good management,\r\nwhich means doing the things that need to be done at the right time.\r\n\r\nIf the farm is large there is a necessity for employing hired labor, and\r\nthe costs of this labor, especially under inexperienced management, are\r\nlikely to be out of line with the value of the products raised. In many\r\ninstances the lack of technical experience can be corrected by dependence\r\nupon governmental agencies, such as experiment stations, county\r\nagricultural agents and departments of agriculture. These services are\r\navailable to every farmer, in most cases without cost, and all that he\r\nneeds is the will to avail himself of such expert help. In the cases of\r\nfarms that have been abandoned, we find that the operators did not make\r\ncontacts with dependable sources of information, an indication of the\r\nnecessity of cooperating with the agricultural agencies or with\r\nexperienced and successful neighboring farmers.\r\n\r\nStill another cause of failure lies in the purchase of a farm at a price\r\nwhich requires the assumption of a mortgage which is too high in relation\r\nto the income from the farm. In short, an attempt to operate on an\r\novercapitalized basis will, sooner or later, lead to disaster. Failure to\r\nlocate on a productive type of soil may easily lead to loss of the\r\ninvestment. If the local conditions, including good roads, school\r\nadvantages and a healthy community spirit, are lacking, there will develop\r\na feeling of discouragement and mental dissatisfaction which destroys\r\nmorale and creates the desire to get out from under at any cost.\r\n\r\n_The Stocked Farm._--The question is frequently raised as to whether a\r\nfarm should be bought already stocked with work and domestic animals and\r\nwith farm equipment or whether it should be stocked by the operator\r\nhimself. This will depend, of course, upon the type of equipment which may\r\nbe available in the individual case. Sometimes fairly good equipment will\r\nbe sold with the farm as a means of facilitating a sale, but the value of\r\neach item should be determined by someone experienced in prices of such\r\nlivestock or commodities as may be sold with the farm.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the buyer has loaded himself with animals or equipment that\r\nare ill adapted to the farm or that are of no particular value, and in\r\nstruggling to get along with them he may seriously handicap the efficiency\r\nof his labors. In most cases it will be found a better practice to add\r\nstock and equipment as the need becomes definite and the finances of the\r\noperator make it possible for him to add them to the farm. In this way he\r\nwill be fairly sure of acquiring only those items which will be of direct\r\nuse and benefit to him and will avoid an accumulation of worn-out or\r\nantiquated articles which will not meet the requirements he must observe\r\nin selecting tools for his work.\r\n\r\n_Avoiding Fire Loss._--Possibility of loss by fire is an ever-present\r\nreality to the owner of a country place. There are two methods of\r\npreventing loss, and the observance of both will contribute to the peace\r\nof mind of the owner.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he should make sure that adequate insurance is carried\r\non his buildings and equipment so that in case of loss through fire there\r\nwill be sufficient indemnity to permit the rebuilding of the destroyed or\r\ndamaged structures. Lightning heads the list of the causes of farm fires\r\nand is frequently not reckoned with by urban residents who have seen\r\nlittle evidence of its destructiveness. In cities, points of electrical\r\nconcentration are avoided by diffusion through piping, metal poles and a\r\nnumber of other conductors of electricity. The owner of a country home can\r\nsecure quite complete protection from damage through lightning by the use\r\nof electrical conductors, usually called lightning rods, properly\r\ninstalled. Such equipment does away with 90 per cent of the risk caused by\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nIn installing a system of lightning rods, it is well to observe a few\r\nsimple precautions. The most exposed parts of a building should be\r\nprovided with rods and the rod points should extend 3 to 4 feet above the\r\nstructure. Conductors from the rod point should go in the most direct line\r\npossible to the ground and sharp bends in the conductors should be\r\navoided. One of the most essential precautions is to thoroughly ground the\r\nconductors. Water pipes on the buildings furnish excellent grounding. The\r\ngrounds for the conductors must be deep enough in the soil to reach\r\npermanent moisture. Lightning rods that are not properly constructed or\r\nproperly grounded may be a worse menace than if no such protection is\r\nattempted. Specific methods of protecting farm buildings from lightning\r\ndamage can be secured from state agricultural agencies or from reliable\r\ncommercial firms which make a practice of erecting them.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of fires lies in unsound chimney construction. By using care\r\nand the proper materials in the building of chimneys, fire may be avoided.\r\nChimney bricks should be laid flat rather than on edge, thereby\r\npractically eliminating the development of chimney cracks through which\r\nsparks can escape into floor spaces, attics and roofs.\r\n\r\nFire risks to residences and other buildings can be reduced by building\r\nthe roof of fireproof or fire-resistant materials. Wooden shingles, while\r\nattractive and inexpensive, may become so dry at certain seasons of the\r\nyear as to furnish tinder for sparks that may rise from a brush fire or\r\nfrom burning buildings in the vicinity. The use of slate or asbestos\r\nshingles is recommended for roofs and there are other materials now on the\r\nmarket which have fire-resistant qualities and can be safely utilized.\r\nFlying sparks carried along on high winds constitute little menace to\r\nthose who have equipped their roofs with non-inflammable materials.\r\n\r\nIt is important to see that electrical wiring has been properly installed,\r\nand for this purpose it is safest to secure expert help. If the menace of\r\nfire is properly evaluated by the owner, he will naturally take suitable\r\nprecautions to cope with it, both through utilizing adequate preventive\r\nmeasures and through having available equipment to make possible the\r\nsmothering of accidental fires which may develop. The application of these\r\navailable common-sense methods of fire prevention will practically\r\neliminate the fire risk. An ounce of such prevention effort is to be\r\nstressed rather than placing dependence on means of fire suppression after\r\nthe combustion occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do's_\r\n\r\nKeep capital investment as low as possible.\r\n\r\nIf part of capital must be borrowed, select type of mortgage that can be\r\npaid off most conveniently.\r\n\r\nDetermine tax rate before buying.\r\n\r\nMake sure that title is clear and the property lines definitely fixed.\r\n\r\nIf some income is expected, check on possibilities of location with that\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\nPlan to secure income from intensive crop and animal projects, _e.g._,\r\nvegetables and poultry.\r\n\r\nUse governmental aids to the fullest extent.\r\n\r\nCarry adequate insurance on buildings, equipment and furniture as\r\nprotection against fire loss.\r\n\r\nInstall protection against lightning.\r\n\r\nBe sure electrical wiring is properly installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don'ts_\r\n\r\nDon't become heavily involved with fixed financial obligations at outset.\r\n\r\nAvoid localities with heavy bonded indebtedness, resulting in excessive\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nDon't expect to get an income from growing staple crops such as grains.\r\n\r\nDon't become dependent on hired labor if it can be avoided.\r\n\r\nAvoid unproductive soil and top-heavy investment of capital.\r\n\r\nDon't buy a stocked farm unless the stock is adapted to needs and properly\r\nvalued.\r\n\r\nDon't neglect to take every precaution against fire.\r\n\r\nDon't forget chimney flues are potential risks.\r\n\r\nAvoid roofs of inflammable materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ IV\r\n\r\nATTRIBUTES OF A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of selecting a home is always a serious one. Success in\r\nchoosing a satisfactory location and home in the country calls for careful\r\nstudy and good judgment throughout the procedure. In urban centers many\r\nservices are taken for granted, such as water supply, sewerage, public\r\nutility connections and delivery systems. The establishment of a home in\r\nthe country calls for the consideration of all these services. Some may\r\nnot be available and preparations must be made to do without them or to\r\nset up such procedures as will take care of the family's needs on the\r\nbasis of the individual home.\r\n\r\n_The Rural Home._--To give the elements of satisfactory living under\r\nmodest circumstances, the country home should be so located and serviced\r\nas to give the maximum of comfort and convenience for the money invested.\r\nThe location, type of construction and interior arrangement of the home\r\nare important factors in attaining these objectives.\r\n\r\nUnless the location selected already has buildings on it which meet the\r\nneeds of the purchaser and his family, there will be the immediate problem\r\nof building the home or remodeling the structure already in existence. In\r\nrecent years a great deal of attention has been given to rural homes,\r\nstimulated no doubt by the very evident trend of population from the city\r\nto the country. These homes should have attributes distinctly their own\r\nand should harmonize with the purpose and the location in mind. A house\r\nwith lines that look well in town or city may be only a blot on the\r\nlandscape when set in the open country. Many excellent recommendations\r\nhave been made for country houses by the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, the President's Conference on Home Building and Home\r\nOwnership (December, 1931) and by architects who have given this problem\r\nthe specific attention it deserves.\r\n\r\nIn general, we may say that the exterior of the house should have simple\r\nlines and should not be ostentatious or covered with inappropriate\r\ndecorative effects. This is especially the case where the house is\r\ncomparatively small and is located in the open country where there is a\r\nsimple and pleasing natural background. The country house should be low\r\nand broad, rather than tall and narrow. The windows and doors should be\r\nof a size and shape that will meet utilitarian requirements and be so\r\nsituated as to give a pleasing and attractive appearance to the whole\r\nstructure. The materials used should be selected to meet the needs of\r\neconomy in the original construction and should be of long-lasting type,\r\nassuring economy in maintenance.\r\n\r\n_Essential Requirements._--In planning the house there are certain minimum\r\nrequirements which should be kept in mind. For example, the sleeping\r\nfacilities should include at least one bedroom for every two persons and\r\nshould contain not less than 100 square feet per room. All sleeping rooms\r\nshould be provided with cross ventilation, that is, with a window on each\r\nof two sides, and sufficient closet or wardrobe space should be provided,\r\nequipped with shelves and hangers for taking care of clothing. Ordinary\r\nlighting facilities for each room include at least one window, with the\r\nkitchen, living room and sleeping areas preferably having two. Windows\r\nshould be so placed as to permit direct sunlight to enter at least\r\nthree-fourths of the rooms. There should be daylight and artificial lights\r\non all work surfaces such as the stove, the sink, work tables and in the\r\nfamily reading center.\r\n\r\nEspecial attention given in advance to the kitchen will be more than\r\nrepaid by the convenience and efficiencies secured. There should be ample\r\nbuilt-in kitchen equipment for small and large utensils, kitchen tools and\r\nlinens. Ample lighting devices should be employed and step-saving\r\narrangements provided so as to eliminate as much effort as possible in\r\ncarrying out the daily duties that are conducted in this important part of\r\nthe country home.\r\n\r\nWhere the funds available for construction or remodeling are limited, it\r\nis important to know what the cost will be before the job is started. This\r\nprocedure calls for a plan which will show the exterior appearance, the\r\ninterior arrangement, and the cost of the completed job. Plans can be\r\nsecured from many sources in addition to those already mentioned. Persons\r\nwith architectural experience and ability may often be employed directly\r\nto plan the house and to supervise its construction. If the prospective\r\nbuilder wishes to select his own plans and to know in advance the complete\r\ncost, he can secure from processors of lumber a catalog of plans which are\r\naccompanied by costs of every item needed. Such processors cut the\r\nmaterial to fit at the factory and identify each piece so that the\r\nmechanically minded man can do much of the work himself with help he may\r\nemploy. These companies will also quote prices on the cost of erection by\r\ntheir own employees in addition to the cost of materials. The outlay\r\nneeded for lighting, plumbing and heating facilities can also be obtained\r\nfrom the same source.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy U. S. Department of Agriculture_)\r\n\r\nA modest country home.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy U. S. Department of Agriculture_)\r\n\r\nFloor plans of house shown on opposite page.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother method of procedure is to draw a plan of the house that contains\r\nthe rooms considered necessary, submit such plans to a lumber merchant and\r\nget quotations on costs of various types of material necessary to\r\nconstruct it. Such construction will usually require the services of a\r\nskilled carpenter and mason but permits of more latitude in most cases\r\nthan is available under a set building arrangement.\r\n\r\n_Types of Country Houses._--Illustrations of small houses suitable for the\r\ncountry are shown on pages 8 and 44. The floor plans of these houses are\r\nshown on the facing pages. There are many other types of small houses\r\nadapted to use in the country and the selection of any one is largely a\r\nmatter of individual preference and ability to finance.\r\n\r\nBecause of the variation in prices of material in different locations, the\r\nkind and quality of material that the owner may desire and also the amount\r\nof labor that may be furnished by the owner, it is difficult to give in\r\ndefinite terms the cost of various types of buildings. Estimates of costs\r\nof materials and construction may easily be obtained from contractors in\r\nthe vicinity.\r\n\r\nSimply with the idea of giving approximate costs, the Conference on Home\r\nBuilding gives the following cost bases for building frame dwellings,\r\nobtained roughly by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.\r\nNaturally the cost will vary in different sections of the country, and the\r\nlevel of artistry that is set up by the builder himself will be a factor.\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE COSTS PER CUBIC FOOT FOR FRAME DWELLINGS\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------\r\n                                                | Southern  |  Northern\r\n  ----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  First recommended level--2, 3 or 4 rooms with |           |\r\n   masonry base, fire-resistive flue, both sides|           |\r\n   of studs covered, painted exterior, interior |           |\r\n   finish.                                      |   *10-15c |  *12-18c\r\n  Second level--Bathroom space, better finish   |    12-18  |   15-21\r\n  Medium level--5-6 rooms, with plumbing        |    16-23  |   20-26\r\n  Fourth level--Adequate standard plumbing and  |           |\r\n   hardwood floors                              |    19-27  |   23-30\r\n  Fifth level--Comparable to better type of     |           |\r\n   middle-class city home                       |    25-35  |   28-35\r\n  ----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  * The cheapest type of shelter (shack) may be built for perhaps half\r\n    this cost.\r\n\r\n_Pre-fabricated Houses._--The field of house construction has been\r\noccupied almost exclusively by the individual architect or builder who has\r\nwrought according to the general ideas of the intending occupant or the\r\nreal estate developer. When the plans are completed and approved, the\r\ncontractor assembles the necessary materials from local sources, builds\r\nand equips the house and turns it over to the buyer in completed\r\ncondition. Under such a procedure there is little application of mass\r\nproduction measures which have reduced costs and raised quality standards\r\nin many industries, notably in automobile construction, for example.\r\n\r\nThousands of houses built to sell in the recent construction era of the\r\n1920's have proved unsatisfactory and costly to the occupants as the\r\nresult of shoddy building methods. Such methods seem to be typically\r\nAmerican as distinguished from the far more solid and permanent Old World\r\nprocedure. It now seems likely that the problem of economical and\r\nsubstantial housing will be met in the method that is also\r\nAmerican--namely, by the pre-fabricated house to which various natural\r\nresources of the country contribute. The parts of such houses are made\r\nunder mass production methods and easily assembled on the owner's lot. The\r\nsame idea can be applied with ease to apartment house construction in any\r\nlocation. The first step in this direction has already been mentioned in\r\nthe case of mail-order companies which cut the lumber to fit and supply\r\nevery needed accessory to the last detail.\r\n\r\nThe next step, and the one that bids fair to inaugurate an entirely new\r\nhouse-building procedure, is now in the making, although as yet it is in\r\nthe experimental and testing stage. Examples of such construction made\r\ntheir first public appearance at the Century of Progress Exposition at\r\nChicago in 1933.\r\n\r\nMaterials that enter into the construction of these new-type houses\r\ninclude steel, asbestos, aluminum and cement. As a rule, the buildings\r\nhave a steel frame erected on cement foundations and without a cellar; the\r\nwalls and partitions are of asbestos composition and the roof constructed\r\nof steel sheets with aluminum insulation. Such a building is fireproof and\r\nproof also against vermin, lightning, wind and earthquake. The house is\r\nalso adapted to and equipped with heating, lighting, plumbing and air\r\nconditioning facilities. The whole building is pre-planned and\r\npre-fabricated as a unit with its component parts constructed under\r\neconomical and interchangeable mass production methods.\r\n\r\nModifications of the construction above mentioned include the use of\r\nsound-proofed steel panels or insulation board for partitions and walls\r\nwith an exterior of painted steel. Many other modifications are being\r\ndeveloped to insure individuality, stability, insulation and economy in\r\nfirst cost and maintenance. The lines of most of these houses are severe\r\nand modernistic in design, although decorative and unique effects are\r\neasily obtainable.\r\n\r\nThe costs of the complete house unit range from $600 for a one-room type\r\nto $3,500 to $6,000 for a complete home of modest size. The principal\r\nfabricators of these houses and their addresses are: General Houses, Inc.,\r\nChicago, Illinois; American Houses, Inc., New York City; American Rolling\r\nMill Company, Cleveland, Ohio; American Radiator and Standard Sanitary\r\nCompany, New York City; Columbian Steel Tank Company, Kansas City,\r\nMissouri, and National Steel Homes, Inc., Los Angeles, California.\r\nInformation on types and costs can be obtained by addressing these\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n_Rural Home Life._--To have a successful experience in country life, one\r\nmust become identified with one's surroundings and become a part of the\r\ncommunity. Those who seek to establish a country residence simply as a\r\nplace from which to commute to city attractions will not only miss the\r\ngreatest asset in country living but will probably find this existence\r\nunsatisfactory. To become interested in the growing plants and animals at\r\nhome, to do with one's own hands the things that make the home more\r\nattractive and to develop a contact with the community that helps to\r\nincrease its normal activities mean the attainment of pleasure and\r\nsatisfaction so far beyond that obtainable in congested urban quarters\r\nthat there is no comparison. In many cases this direct affinity with one's\r\nsurroundings will come gradually and not always easily. It can be\r\ncultivated and should be a part of the plan of every family expecting to\r\nreside in the country.\r\n\r\n_Trees as Assets._--One of the greatest assets that can be secured in the\r\ncountry is well-developed shade. If the house under consideration is\r\nalready built and has around it trees that serve as a softening and\r\nbeautifying factor, as well as for shade purposes, the value is decidedly\r\nenhanced. If the home is to be newly built and a site is available where\r\ntrees are already well grown, the house can often be placed in the midst\r\nof such trees, thereby gaining a number of years in the benefits that\r\ntrees give and for which there is no substitute.\r\n\r\nFew persons can resist the charm of trees. That they also have a definite\r\neconomic value is shown by the added desirability we all attach to an\r\nattractively landscaped home where trees of various kinds and sizes\r\nfurnish the motif. In acquiring a place in the country the newcomer will\r\nat once wish to plant trees, shrubs and ornamentals to beautify his\r\nholdings. If this is carefully planned at the beginning, succeeding years\r\nand a little care will add to the attractiveness and intrinsic value of\r\nthe home. The saying, \"a house is not a home until it is planted,\" has a\r\ngreat deal of truth behind it. Most nurserymen will be glad to render\r\nassistance in properly planning and setting the ornamental landscaping of\r\nthe home, helping the owner avoid mistakes and costly movings and\r\nreplacements later.\r\n\r\n_Commercial Horticulture._--In addition to the plantings around his home,\r\nthe owner of a few acres can at slight expense start small trees for later\r\nornamental use or for sale at a roadside stand, for example. Such small\r\ntrees and ornamental plants can often be purchased at wholesale prices\r\nfrom nursery companies which have \"laying out\" stock, as it is called, for\r\nsale. The standard large-growing evergreens and deciduous shade trees can\r\nbe thus transplanted to one's own acres, as can the popular dwarf types of\r\nevergreens and flowering shrubs. These may be planted in one area where\r\nthey can be cared for as a growing crop, or they may be planted in groups\r\nfor beautifying the premises while they are growing. Again, single plants\r\nmay be set by themselves and given special attention, later becoming\r\n\"specimens\" which are much in demand by admirers of the species.\r\n\r\nAn appreciation of tree habits can be thus developed by all the members of\r\nthe family, and considerable income may be obtained in later years, as\r\nthe trees become \"of age,\" through their sale. We are entering upon an era\r\nof making homes attractive as places in which to live and not as houses to\r\ngo away from. All forms of plant life that contribute to this end will be\r\nadmired and sought after in the years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do's_\r\n\r\nGive special consideration to location, type of construction and interior\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nIf building a home, select a type that fits surroundings.\r\n\r\nStrive for simplicity of lines and full utilization of every cubic foot of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nRemember pre-fabricated houses are practical and likely to supplant some\r\nother types of construction.\r\n\r\nIn buying a pre-fabricated house, be sure plans and construction fit needs\r\nof family and materials used are adapted to the climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nGive special attention to convenience and cheerfulness of kitchen.\r\n\r\nDevelop a plan of planting ornamental plants and trees to be carried out\r\nin due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don'ts_\r\n\r\nDon't try to build a city house in the country.\r\n\r\nDon't neglect windows in number or size.\r\n\r\nDon't overlook costs of completed job before commencing building or\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nDon't neglect the asset value of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ V\r\n\r\nSERVICING THE HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nMany types of services are available to the country home owner, including\r\nrural mail delivery, the telephone and electricity. Rural mail delivery in\r\nparticular is so common that, on practically every highway, mail service\r\nis secured by the placing of a mail box along the highway at the entrance\r\nto the residence. Telephone service is available along practically all the\r\nmain-traveled highways and on a majority of the other types of roads.\r\nWhere the lines are not already installed, extensions may be obtained to\r\nnew locations, and this is facilitated when more than one residence is to\r\nbe served by the same line. The majority of families accustomed to city\r\nconveniences will want to have electricity available so as to use electric\r\nlights and the labor-saving devices that are operated by electric power.\r\nWith the expansion that has taken place in the development of rural\r\nelectric lines in recent years, there is not a great deal of difficulty in\r\ngetting a location which will give the housewife the advantages that\r\nelectricity offers.\r\n\r\nTelephone service and electrical facilities may fall into the class of\r\nluxuries for those with limited resources. It may be pointed out in this\r\nconnection that millions of farm homes are still using petroleum products\r\nfor lighting purposes and are finding it no hardship. Practically all\r\nwould, of course, use electricity if it were available and financially\r\npossible. The new home owner in the country will find it advantageous to\r\nlocate where electric service is obtainable.\r\n\r\nOther services for the country residents are pretty largely up to the\r\nowner as to their utilization and type. It is necessary, of course, to\r\nhave an ample water supply, to maintain sanitary conditions through\r\nsewerage of some description, to provide a method of heating the home\r\nduring cold weather and to provide storage facilities for food during the\r\ndormant season.\r\n\r\n_The Water Supply._--Perhaps the most important attribute of the country\r\nhome is an adequate supply of water. This is particularly true where\r\nfamilies have been accustomed to utilizing municipal water supplies which\r\nare safe and pure as to quality and unlimited in amount. In most country\r\nhomes it is necessary to construct a water-supply system, which means\r\nreaching a supply of underground water, pumping it to the surface and\r\npiping it to locations where it is wanted. Higher standards of living\r\ncreate new and increased demands for water.\r\n\r\nWater for domestic use should be clear, colorless, odorless, soft, neither\r\nstrongly acid nor alkaline, with a temperature averaging 50 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. Such water supplies can be obtained in nearly every section of\r\nthe country. Hot water is necessary in every home and there must be a\r\nheater of some type, using coal, petroleum products, natural or artificial\r\ngas or electricity for fuel. For this purpose a hot-water storage boiler\r\nor tank must be installed.\r\n\r\n_The Dug Well._--A dug well is one of the older types of wells. It should\r\nbe large enough in diameter to permit ingress and egress to all parts of\r\nit for repairs or for cleaning. Most dug wells require cleaning\r\noccasionally, due to the entrance of dirt at the top and to the washing in\r\nof clay and silt with the ground water. Many of these wells contain\r\nharmful gases which have proved fatal to those entering them. Before an\r\nattempt is made to clean such a well or to make any repairs, a lighted\r\ncandle should be lowered into it. If the candle is extinguished, it will\r\nbe dangerous to enter until the well has been thoroughly ventilated.\r\n\r\nA dug well will vary in depth from 20 to 60 feet, depending upon the\r\ndistance it is necessary to dig for an adequate supply of water. Types\r\nof pumping apparatus are on the market to cope with any depth in digging\r\nsuch a well. If dug wells are shallow, the water supply depends very\r\nlargely upon current rainfall and in times of prolonged drouth there may\r\nbe a serious shortage. Fairly deep wells of this type are usually very\r\nsatisfactory and will supply surprisingly large amounts of water when the\r\ndemand is made upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Well drilling--an early step in locating in the country. In\r\nthe foreground may be seen part of the excavation for the house.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artesian Water Supply._--Artesian wells have distinct advantages over dug\r\nwells although they are more expensive to construct. The water from such\r\nwells is absolutely pure and it never fails. This is because subterranean\r\nstreams have been tapped which are not subject to possible surface\r\ncontamination, nor are they dependent upon showers for replenishment.\r\n\r\nSpecial power apparatus is necessary for constructing an artesian or\r\ndrilled well. The drilling costs from $3 per foot up, depending upon the\r\nnature of the subsoil and whether rock is encountered. Unless such a well\r\nhas been drilled in the immediate vicinity it is not possible to hazard\r\neven a guess as to when water will be struck. The consolation that such an\r\nundertaking has for the owner is in knowing there will be no doubt as to\r\nquantity or purity when the strike occurs.\r\n\r\n_Water Pumps._--Pumps are now available which operate automatically by\r\nelectricity and constantly supply the home with fresh water drawn from the\r\nearth as needed. The requirements for the pump and the motor will vary\r\nwith the depth of the well and the water requirements of the family. In\r\nall such cases, therefore, it is desirable to call in for consultation\r\nengineers or competent representatives of pump manufacturers or\r\ndistributors. It should be borne in mind that adequacy of supply is most\r\nimportant and that economy in first cost, achieved at the sacrifice of an\r\nadequate supply, may be a definite handicap to necessary home services.\r\n\r\n_Heating Facilities._--The type of heating apparatus that is used will\r\ndepend upon the size of the house and its arrangement as well as upon the\r\nfunds available. The simplest type of heaters are those which do not have\r\na complete system of extending radiation through the home but depend upon\r\ncirculation of the air within the house to equalize the temperature. In\r\ndeciding upon the type of apparatus, it is necessary to make sure that the\r\nsystem is as low in original cost as possible; that it will probably have\r\na long life, thereby spreading the first cost over a period of years; that\r\nit be economical in operation through efficient consumption of fuel, and\r\nthat the system be easily controlled. The health of the family and the\r\nability to live in a satisfactory manner will depend to a considerable\r\nextent upon the method of heating the home, especially in cold climates.\r\n\r\nParticular care should be taken to make sure that whatever type of heating\r\nis employed is adequate in size. It is more economical to operate a heater\r\nthat is somewhat oversized than to \"rush\" one which cannot easily maintain\r\na comfortable temperature in cold weather. Heating engineers and\r\ncontractors are available to furnish information on heating costs in every\r\nlocality. The generally used types of heating include stoves, circulator\r\nheaters, warm air, hot water and steam systems, and fireplaces.\r\nSpecialists of the United States Department of Agriculture have developed\r\na great deal of information to enable the home owner to cope with the\r\nheating problems in a practical manner. It is estimated by the department\r\nthat if a two-pipe hot-water system for a six-room house costs $500, the\r\nother systems for the same house ordinarily would cost about as follows:\r\n\r\n  Two-pipe vapor system               $600\r\n  One-pipe steam system               $400\r\n  A piped warm air furnace            $260\r\n  Pipeless furnace                    $140\r\n  Circulator heater or stove          $ 60\r\n\r\nOf course, these systems vary in efficiency and in providing comfort as\r\nmuch as they vary in cost, but these estimates will provide the home\r\nowner with an idea of the outlay for taking care of the heating problem.\r\n\r\nThe ability to maintain a satisfactory temperature depends as much upon\r\nthe construction of the house as upon the heating apparatus itself. Heat\r\nis readily lost through walls, roofs and windows. Most houses can be made\r\nmore comfortable at small cost by applying insulation or by correcting\r\ndefects in construction. The use of storm doors or storm vestibules where\r\ndoors are frequently opened to the out-of-doors will prevent drafts and\r\nconserve heat. Metal weather stripping is the most effective means of\r\npreventing air leaks around windows and doors and making the entire house\r\nweather-tight.\r\n\r\nThe fuel that is used will depend upon the type of furnace and the\r\nrelative prices prevailing for different kinds. Recent developments in oil\r\nheating bring this fuel in close competition from the standpoint of\r\neconomy with coal or coke. Oil is particularly adaptable as a source of\r\nfuel in homes in the country since tank trucks can readily deliver oil to\r\nthe home owner. Improvements in securing the maximum efficiency from all\r\ntypes of fuel are being developed continually; and there are now on the\r\nmarket furnaces, using anthracite or bituminous coal as fuel, which offer\r\nmany advantages that were unknown to older types.\r\n\r\n_Fireplace Construction._--An open fireplace where wood can be used as\r\nfuel is a great source of satisfaction and pleasure, as well as a comfort,\r\nin country homes. Wood of proper length for fireplace burning can be\r\nreadily secured in the country and there is ample room for storing it.\r\nWhere the house is small in size, such wood fires can be used for heating\r\nthe house satisfactorily in spring and fall and can be used to supplement\r\nother types of heating when desired.\r\n\r\nNo country home can be considered complete without a fireplace. The\r\ncomfort and homelike atmosphere that it gives make it a general asset for\r\nthe enjoyment of the family circle. Fireplaces should be constructed so as\r\nto insure a good draft with a maximum of heat radiation. It is desirable\r\nto build in the fireplace flue a damper which can be open when the fire is\r\nburning and can be shut when it is desired to keep heat from escaping from\r\nthe room via the chimney. It is also a convenience to have a trap opening\r\nplaced in the back of the fireplace on the floor so that ashes may be\r\nremoved in this manner, eliminating the labor of carrying them from the\r\nfireplace.\r\n\r\n_Sewerage of Farm Homes._--All wastes from the farm home coming under the\r\nterm of sewage should go direct to a septic tank. Here the sewage is held\r\nin a quiet state for a period of time, and through bacterial processes,\r\nthe organic matter is destroyed. A septic-tank installation consists of\r\nfour parts: first, the house sewer from house to tank; second, the sewage\r\ntank, consisting of one or more chambers; third, the sewer from tank to\r\ndistribution field; fourth, the distribution field where the sewage is\r\ndistributed, sometimes called the absorption field. Plans for sewerage\r\nconstruction may be obtained from state and local boards of health and\r\nfrom federal health and agricultural agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy New Jersey Agricultural Extension Service_)\r\n\r\nAn adequate sewage disposal plant is essential and inexpensive. A\r\npractical one is shown here.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rural Engineering Department of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation recommends that the septic tank have a capacity adequate to hold\r\nall the water used by the family for two entire days. For a family of six\r\npersons the inside dimensions of the tank should be 4 feet in width with a\r\nlength of 4 feet in the first chamber and 3 feet in the second chamber.\r\nThe depth of water should be 4 feet, giving the tank a capacity of over\r\n600 gallons, thus allowing 100 gallons for each person during the\r\nforty-eight-hour period. The entire tank will be 4 feet wide, 8-1/2 feet\r\nlong and 6-1/2 feet deep.\r\n\r\nSeptic tanks are usually built of solid concrete, concrete blocks or\r\nbrick, waterproofed on the inside to prevent escape of the contents except\r\nthrough the outlets described. These outlets should be 100 to 150 feet\r\naway from any source of water supply to prevent contamination of potable\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nLeading from the outlet of the second chamber, several lines of tile 10 to\r\n14 inches in depth should be laid at a gentle slope away from the tank,\r\npermitting escape of the effluent at each joint. For a family of six\r\npersons a total length of 150 feet of tile pipe will be sufficient in most\r\ntypes of soil.\r\n\r\n_Food Storage._--Every country home should have a basement in which a room\r\ncan be set apart for cold storage. Such a place is suitable for keeping\r\nsupplies of potatoes and other root crops, as well as commodities that\r\ndeteriorate under conditions of warmth. Surplus supplies of food from the\r\ngarden can be placed in such storages and be readily available for use\r\nduring the winter. With the surplus of perishable food products in cans\r\nand with a good supply of non-perishable products in such a type of\r\nstorage room, economies in food purchase can be effected and the\r\nhealthfulness of the family maintained through their use when fresh\r\nproducts are difficult to secure or are unseasonable and expensive.\r\n\r\nIf a basement is not available for food storage, root crops can be stored\r\noutside the house and kept during the winter. These products should be\r\npiled in a heap, covered with straw or other clean, loose material and\r\nthe mound then covered with earth. In this manner, potatoes and similar\r\ncrops can be kept throughout the winter and until late in the spring\r\nwithout serious deterioration. It is important to select a site for such\r\noutdoor storage that is well drained so that water will not collect and\r\nfreeze in the storage area.\r\n\r\n_Services Available to the Country Resident._--Public agencies are\r\navailable for help in solving the problems of country residents, varying\r\nfrom agricultural and horticultural practices to building construction,\r\nwater supply and sewage disposal. As a rule, these services are of advice\r\nand suggestion, are free of cost and may be utilized freely by those\r\nliving in the country.\r\n\r\nMost of the counties in the United States have a county agricultural\r\nagent, who is located at the county seat and whose territory covers only\r\nthe county in which he resides. The costs of such service are paid by\r\nfederal and state appropriations, frequently supplemented by county\r\nappropriations, and also frequently through annual individual\r\nsubscriptions. The county agricultural agent is really a field\r\nrepresentative of the United States Department of Agriculture and of the\r\nstate agricultural college in the state where he works. There is hardly a\r\nproblem of the country resident for which he cannot obtain aid from the\r\ncounty agricultural agent. In many of the more thickly populated areas the\r\nproblems of the family getting a location on the land for a home are\r\nalready well known to the agricultural agent and he is therefore in a\r\nposition to guide the newcomer and help him to prevent mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn many counties there is also a home economics service connected with the\r\noffice of the county agricultural agent and supported in the same general\r\nmanner. This service, along the lines which the name implies, is available\r\nto the country home maker. Groups of women are organized and meet at\r\nintervals for discussions on food preparation, canning and storage and the\r\nmaking of clothing for the family.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every state there is a state department of agriculture with\r\nregulatory and promotional activities and dealing especially with law\r\nenforcement provisions passed by the respective legislatures. These\r\nagencies are also concerned with development of marketing facilities in\r\nmany states. They are supported by state and federal funds and carry on\r\nsuch projects as the testing of cattle for tuberculosis, treatment in\r\nprevention of communicable animal diseases and the control of insect and\r\nfungous pests through quarantine and inspection activities. These\r\ndepartments are located at the state capitols and information on the\r\nservices available can be secured by addressing the department in the\r\nstate where one resides.\r\n\r\nBecause there is a lack of understanding among newcomers to the country of\r\nthe services that are available through these agencies without cost, this\r\nparticular mention of them is made. It is recommended that each family get\r\nin touch with the county agricultural agent, the college of agriculture\r\nand the department of agriculture and learn definitely of the help that\r\ncan be secured without cost in meeting the problems of country life.\r\n\r\n_Electric Wiring Principles._--Public utilities are organized to furnish\r\nelectric service and it will be found that they are ready to assist\r\ncustomers in securing the most satisfactory use of electricity. Such\r\nknowledge, based on experience, will be valuable in helping owners to\r\navoid costly mistakes and to provide for a wiring system that will be\r\neconomical and yet complete. When the plans and specifications of the\r\nwiring system have been worked out, it is important to secure bids from\r\nreliable contractors. Only those contractors who can do the work in a\r\ncapable manner should be employed and it should be determined in advance\r\nthat the installation will be in strict compliance with the National\r\nElectrical Code. For wiring work it is necessary to know the number of\r\namperes the wire is to carry. This may be determined by dividing the load\r\nin watts by the voltage which is to be used.\r\n\r\nThe service lateral is a system of wires which form a path over which\r\nelectricity is carried from the main line to the house. This is generally\r\nbuilt by the utility company and its cost will depend upon the distance of\r\nthe residence from the main line and whether the owner furnishes poles,\r\nlabor, etc.\r\n\r\nWires should be of such size as to give sufficient mechanical strength to\r\nstand up under sleet conditions. Usually three entrance wires are used to\r\ncarry the electric energy from the utility connection to the house. The\r\nlateral is the electrical doorway to the farm and is the most essential\r\npart of the wiring system. The wires should be of adequate size so as to\r\nprovide proper voltage and give complete electrical service for all\r\nordinary requirements of current.\r\n\r\nIt is important to see that the electrical equipment is properly\r\n\"grounded,\" that is, the connecting to earth of certain metallic objects\r\nwhich are near power conductors. The purpose is to carry to the earth any\r\nheavy electrical charge which might exist on such objects and cause\r\nelectrical shocks when they are touched. Grounding may be secured by\r\nconnecting with water pipes that reach some depth under ground, or driven\r\npipe may be used as a means of securing intimate contact with moist earth.\r\n\r\nRecommendations for outlets from the electrical wires in the house call\r\nfor centering ceiling lighting outlets, and placing wall brackets about\r\n5-1/2 feet above the floor. Convenient outlets in the kitchen and bathroom\r\nshould be about 33 inches above the floor. In other locations they are\r\nusually best placed in the baseboard. Wall switches are usually located 4\r\nfeet above the floor. A switch should be located at each door to a room or\r\nentrance to a hall and in many cases three-way switches can be used to\r\nadvantage, since these afford control over the same lighting from two\r\nseparate locations.\r\n\r\nWith these general observations on a rather complicated subject, most of\r\nwhich are based on the excellent recommendations of the National Committee\r\non the Relation of Electricity to Agriculture, the home owner should be in\r\na position to take care of his needs properly, bearing in mind that the\r\nsystem of wiring should be adequate in every respect and the number of\r\noutlets sufficiently numerous to provide easy and convenient service\r\nthroughout the house. An official check-up should be made of all\r\ninstallations after completion. The method of securing such inspection\r\ncan be obtained through a local electrical contractor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy New Jersey Agricultural Extension Service_)\r\n\r\nGround floor plan of a house, showing the number, the type, and the\r\nlocation of electrical current outlets.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tank Gas Supply._--A service of supplying compressed gas in portable\r\ntanks has recently been developed for country homes located away from\r\npublic gas lines. This gas can be used either with a specially adapted\r\nrange which is supplied as part of the service or in some cases with an\r\nordinary gas range. Companies offering this service are located in most\r\ncities and are understood to be willing to supply residences anywhere with\r\ngas. The cost of first installation of the system is about $40. Renewals\r\ncost approximately $12 per cylinder of gas. Each cylinder will supply a\r\nfamily of four with gas for three to four months, making a monthly bill of\r\nfrom $3 to $4, which compares favorably with artificial gas supply through\r\na meter from pipe lines. This gas may be used for any purpose for which\r\nany other gas is adapted. The gas and the servicing of it constitute a\r\nboon to country residents from the standpoint of utility and economy. It\r\nis especially desirable for those previously accustomed to city gas\r\nsupplies and to whom the use of any other type of fuel is strange and\r\nsomewhat of a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do's_\r\n\r\nRemember that important service factors include mail delivery, telephone,\r\nelectricity, water supply and sewage disposal.\r\n\r\nBe sure of adequate water supply of good quality.\r\n\r\nObtain artesian water supply wherever possible.\r\n\r\nProvide for such heating facilities as the budget can stand.\r\n\r\nSelect the heating system in relation to fuel costs.\r\n\r\nMake sure that the sewerage system is adequate for waste disposal.\r\n\r\nUse fully such governmental agencies as county agents, home demonstration\r\nagents, experiment stations and agricultural colleges, state and federal\r\ndepartments of agriculture.\r\n\r\nProvide storage space for surplus food products.\r\n\r\nRemember electric wiring requires skilled workmanship.\r\n\r\nInvestigate advantages and costs of tank gas as a cooking fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don'ts_\r\n\r\nDon't forget that services automatically available to urban residents must\r\nbe planned for in the country.\r\n\r\nDon't neglect construction defects that prevent full benefits from heating\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nDon't overlook the advantages of a well-built fireplace.\r\n\r\nDon't install electrical service without full attention to principles of\r\nconvenience, safety and economy involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ VI\r\n\r\nMAKING THE SOIL PRODUCE CROPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many treatises available that deal with the soil, its\r\ncomposition and its treatment. No attempt will be made here to go\r\nexhaustively into that subject. There are a few fundamental factors,\r\nhowever, which the potential owner should know regarding soil treatment,\r\nfor that is the base upon which he will build his income-producing\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe particles of soil have had their genesis in rock. The rock has become\r\ndisintegrated and decomposed through natural processes. The action of the\r\nweather is the most important factor in creating soil. Water falling on\r\nrock not only wears it away mechanically, but through certain mild acid\r\nelements which it acquires, disintegrates the binding materials that hold\r\nrock segments together. In addition, there is the action of frost and\r\nfreezing, too, making the moisture in rock expand and contract and thereby\r\ncausing the breaking down of the segments. With this action is coupled\r\nthat of hot suns which cause expansion and breaking up of the rock as it\r\nbecomes heated and cooled under atmospheric influence.\r\n\r\nA great deal of the soil surface in many sections of the country is the\r\nresult of glacial action. These glaciers not only eroded the surface,\r\nthereby creating millions of rock particles, but they also carried large\r\ndeposits of the rock particles to more distant areas and deposited them\r\nover a subsoil that may be totally different in character from the surface\r\nsoil thus deposited.\r\n\r\n_How Tillable Soil Is Made._--The action of plants themselves has a great\r\neffect in adding to our supply of tillable soil. Seeds of plants or seeds\r\nof trees become established in some slightly weathered rock areas and\r\nbegin to grow. The roots penetrate wherever there is any loose soil, and\r\npartly by their pressure and partly through the acidity accompanying\r\ndecomposing plant tissue, complete a further breaking down of the rock.\r\nThere is a continuous process of destruction of rocks and leveling off of\r\nmountains and hills to fill the valleys below.\r\n\r\nMany groups of deep-rooted plants tend to increase the depth of the\r\nsurface soil by growth of the roots in the subsoil and by creating therein\r\na condition approaching that which already exists on the surface. The\r\naction of earth worms and similar forms of life in bringing subsoil to\r\nthe top and in opening channels through which water and surface air can\r\npenetrate constitutes another continually operating force in the creation\r\nof a productive soil. A deeper layer of productive soil can also be\r\ncreated through a plan of consistently deeper plowing, bringing up with\r\neach annual plowing operation a small portion of subsoil which, when mixed\r\nwith the surface soil, tends to become like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy New Jersey Department of Conservation and\r\nDevelopment_)\r\n\r\nSoil is created from rock by nature's weathering processes and by plant\r\ngrowth. At the bottom may be seen solid rock; just above are\r\ndisintegrating rock fragments, and at the top, the soil.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery type of real soil contains all the elements of plant growth. This\r\nplant food results from a breaking down of soil particles and the setting\r\nfree of chemical elements which, either singly or in combination, serve as\r\nfood for plants.\r\n\r\nWhatever the type of soil may be, it will be found that certain crops will\r\nmake better growth in it than others. As a general rule, it may be said\r\nthat the only way to determine which plants will grow best on a given soil\r\nis by the trial-and-error method. However, by observation of the growth on\r\nsimilar types of soil we can learn something of a soil's crop\r\nadaptability. There are some crops that will grow in almost any soil and\r\nthere are others that need an exactness of texture, moisture and plant\r\nfood which makes them highly specialized products. The operator must learn\r\nhow to work in harmony with the peculiarities of his own soil before he\r\ncan hope to get the best results.\r\n\r\nIn acquiring a tract for the growing of plants of any kind it is desirable\r\nto get a soil type that will meet the requirements of most plants. As a\r\ngeneral rule, this type contains enough clay to be retentive of moisture,\r\nenough sand to be easily worked and is generally suitable for bacterial\r\ngrowth. In other words, what is commonly called a loam is the ideal type\r\nfor general agricultural and horticultural purposes. This may be a heavy\r\nloam, in which clay predominates, or a so-called light loam, in which sand\r\nparticles predominate. An examination of a handful of soil by a person\r\nexperienced in farming will indicate its nature and its adaptability to\r\nordinary crop production.\r\n\r\n_Essential Elements of Plant Food._--Countless scientific experiments in\r\nplant growth show that potassium, lime, phosphorus, magnesium, iron,\r\nsulphur, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are essential to normal\r\ndevelopment. The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen elements make up nearly 99\r\nper cent of the entire composition of the plant and are derived from the\r\natmosphere. All of the other elements are derived from the soil except in\r\nthe case of peas, beans, clovers and other legumes which secure most of\r\ntheir nitrogen from the air.\r\n\r\nThe mineral elements are not needed in large amounts but well-balanced\r\nplant growth is strictly dependent upon their presence in available form.\r\nOf these elements, those most likely to be deficient either in total\r\namount or in availability are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium.\r\nIt is entirely feasible and economical to apply concentrated chemical\r\nfertilizers containing the first three elements so that their lack will\r\nnot constitute a limit to size of crops harvested. In many cases it is\r\nnecessary to apply chemical fertilizers to get satisfactory yields, even\r\nwhere natural manures are available and can be applied as well.\r\n\r\nIn addition to supplying essential plant food, nitrogen, phosphorus and\r\npotassium perform specific functions in plant growth. The application of\r\nnitrogen in one of its readily available forms (e.g., nitrate of soda and\r\nsulphate of ammonia) will stimulate vegetative growth. If too much of this\r\none element is applied, leaf and branch development may occur at the\r\nexpense of the crop. Good results follow the use of nitrogen on grass sods\r\nand on leafy vegetables like spinach. On the other hand, corn, peas, beans\r\nand other seed-forming crops need to have the nitrogen balanced with\r\nphosphorus. Potatoes, in common with other tuber and root crops, will\r\nutilize plenty of potassium in the development of starch.\r\n\r\n_Sources of Plant Food._--Chemical fertilizers can be purchased at supply\r\nstores in ready mixed condition and of analyses that will meet general\r\ncrop needs. A good formula for such a general purpose fertilizer is 4 to 5\r\nper cent nitrogen, 7 to 9 per cent phosphoric acid and 7 to 10 per cent\r\npotash to the ton. It is known that such a mixture will supply the food\r\nneeds of a large variety of plants in balanced amounts. Highly\r\nconcentrated mixtures are now on the market providing double the amount of\r\nplant food in the example quoted, costing nearly twice as much but\r\neffecting a saving by cutting in half the material handled to get the same\r\nresult. Care should be taken, in using these highly concentrated\r\nfertilizers, to avoid contact with tender roots. A mixture for general\r\nfarm and garden purposes may contain the following ingredients:\r\n\r\n    100 pounds nitrate of soda\r\n    230 pounds sulphate of ammonia\r\n    250 pounds animal tankage (7 per cent nitrogen)\r\n  1,140 pounds superphosphate (16 per cent phosphoric acid)\r\n    280 pounds muriate of potash (50 per cent potash)\r\n  -----\r\n  2,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis mixture will have a formula of 4-9-7 (4 per cent nitrogen, 9 per cent\r\nphosphoric acid and 7 per cent potassium). The individual who wishes to\r\nmix his own fertilizer may do so by purchasing the finely ground\r\ningredients separately, and by means of a shovel, integrate them all into\r\na mixture. Home mixing will not be found profitable where small amounts of\r\nfertilizer are used. Those who practice home mixing for the first time\r\nshould realize that most combinations of ingredients will \"set\" or harden\r\nif not used immediately, necessitating the breaking up and pulverizing of\r\nthe mass. When it is broken up after curing, no further difficulty should\r\nbe experienced with \"setting\" if the mixture is kept in a dry place. The\r\nadvantages of home mixing for the large user lie in lower cost per ton of\r\nplant food as a rule; confidence in the quality of the ingredients which\r\nhe should purchase on the basis of guaranteed analysis; and the setting up\r\nof a mixture which study of his soil and the plant requirements has\r\nconvinced him is best suited for his individual case.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Soil Analysis Not Helpful._--There is a mistaken notion that it\r\nis necessary to analyze soils chemically in order to fertilize them\r\nintelligently. Such an analysis of a reasonably fertile soil will show the\r\npresence of the essential elements of plant food, though perhaps not all\r\nin sufficient amounts, to produce ordinary crops for centuries to come.\r\nOnly a small amount of the elements become available for root absorption\r\neach year and a chemical analysis will not bring out this most important\r\nfactor--availability. The use of a few simple tests, mainly of a physical\r\nnature by a competent soils specialist, will prove of some assistance in\r\nthe treatment of the soil. Such tests will show the presence of adequate\r\namounts of humus, and indicate the acidity content. The soil texture will\r\ngive some index of its crop adaptability and thereby serve as a basis for\r\nfertilizing treatment that will meet the needs of both soil and crop. The\r\npractical man will not expect any considerable aid from a highly technical\r\nand costly chemical analysis of his soil.\r\n\r\nAnother factor that militates against worth-while benefits of chemical\r\nsoil analysis is the great variation in soil types frequently occurring in\r\nthe same field. To attempt to draw a representative sample by mixing soil\r\nfrom several areas might result in a specimen that would not be really\r\ntypical of any area. For the purpose of ordinary physical examination and\r\ntesting for acidity, representative soil samples should be taken from\r\nseveral parts of the same soil type, mixed together and a composite sample\r\nfor testing drawn from the mixture, weighing not less than a pound in each\r\ncase. If the soil is quite apparently variable it may be necessary to draw\r\ntwo or more composite samples from the same area. Very helpful service in\r\nintelligent soil treatment may be secured from the county agricultural\r\nagent and the state college of agriculture in the county or state of\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n_Legumes as Soil Improvers._--A means of soil improvement that is well\r\nunderstood by progressive farmers is the use of legumes to improve the\r\nsoil. The legumes include a large family of plants of which the bean, the\r\npea and the clovers are outstanding examples. Such plants have on their\r\nroots nodules which house nitrogen-gathering bacteria. These bacteria\r\nabsorb nitrogen from the air in the soil and, in the ordinary process of\r\ngrowth, death and decay, make this nitrogen available to the host plants,\r\nleaving a residue in the soil for the roots of plants that are to follow.\r\nThus this group of plants, known as legumes, have been used for\r\ngenerations as a method of increasing the nitrogen content of soils.\r\nNitrogen, incidentally, is the most costly element to buy in commercial\r\nfertilizers. The soil-improving benefits of legumes may be secured by\r\ngrowing them either for harvest as a source of animal food or for plowing\r\nunder as a means of utilizing them entirely for the development of soil\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nIn reading of the studies of soil fertility that were made by George\r\nWashington at Mount Vernon, we learn of the improvement that he made in\r\nthe relatively poor soils of that area by growing plants of the legume\r\nfamily. The actual reason why such improvement was brought about was not\r\nknown in Washington's time, but the results were apparent. Today, the\r\nvalue of legumes as soil builders is well recognized and we understand\r\nmuch more definitely than Washington did the reasons for their being so\r\nhelpful in increasing crop production.\r\n\r\nMany soil areas do not contain the particular type of bacteria necessary\r\nto the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by legumes. This is frequently the\r\ncause of failure in growing alfalfa, soybeans, cowpeas and less well known\r\nmembers of the legume family. Each legume has its own type of\r\nnodule-forming bacteria. In order to assure the presence of the proper\r\nbacterial family, means often must be employed to add them to the soil\r\nwhere the specific crop is to be grown. This may be accomplished by adding\r\nsoil from an area where the legume does well to the new area, or the seed\r\nmay be inoculated with commercial cultures before seeding. Either method\r\nis effective. If soil is used it should be drilled in or spread on a\r\ncloudy day to prevent the destructive action of the sun's rays on the\r\nexposed minute forms of plant life we call bacteria.\r\n\r\nIf it is not known that the legume to be planted has been grown\r\nsuccessfully in a given field within the previous several years, the\r\nprecaution of adding the proper bacteria should be taken. In some\r\nsections, such legumes as red, alsike, crimson and white clovers have been\r\ngrown for many years and the bacteria for these plants are well\r\ndistributed. There, inoculation is not necessary for these crops, but it\r\nprobably should be practiced if other legumes such as alfalfa, cowpeas or\r\nsoybeans are to be grown on land for the first time.\r\n\r\n_The Value of Humus._--In addition to the chemical elements of plant food,\r\nall productive soils contain decaying vegetable matter, generally\r\nclassified under the term \"humus.\" Humus serves as a source of\r\nacid-generating material which further breaks down soil particles and,\r\nmost important of all, serves as a food for millions of microscopic plants\r\nwhich develop and die quite beyond the scope of human vision. These\r\nconstitute a type of bacteria which are distinctly beneficial and\r\nessential to human life since they make possible the growth of larger\r\nplants that serve as human food.\r\n\r\nGreen plants, straw or leaves, when plowed under or spaded in the soil,\r\nare attacked by bacterial agencies which gradually turn these products\r\ninto humus. The same process occurs when a \"compost\" is set up. This is\r\nmade of leaves, manure, soil, straw and other materials thrown into a\r\nheap and allowed to decay. Such compost is excellent for placing around\r\nplants when setting them out, since it holds moisture, supplies fertility\r\nand creates optimum conditions for young root growth. Under practical\r\nfield conditions, humus may be added to soils by spreading animal manures,\r\nfollowed by plowing them down, or by the growing of heavy green crops such\r\nas wheat, rye, cowpeas or vetch and turning the entire mass under with the\r\nplow when they are at their height.\r\n\r\n_Lime and Its Application._--Reference has been made to the fact that\r\ncalcium is an essential plant food and is frequently deficient in soils.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the great majority of soils are deficient in calcium\r\nand their productiveness is inhibited thereby. Lime supplies calcium and\r\nalso magnesium as food for plants. Its application accomplishes many other\r\ndesirable things such as correcting soil acidity. The growth of beneficial\r\nbacteria is greatly stimulated in a soil that has had its acidity\r\nneutralized by the application of lime. This product, therefore, creates a\r\nmore congenial condition for the growth of bacteria, which, in turn, make\r\nfor better crop production. Lime is also beneficial through furnishing the\r\nelement calcium with which other plant foods combine chemically and\r\nthereby become soluble in the soil water. Unless plant foods are in a\r\nstate of solution, they cannot be absorbed by plant roots. Lime is a\r\npotent force in creating chemical reactions in the soil, resulting in the\r\nstimulation of growth through increased absorption of essential elements\r\nin solution.\r\n\r\nLime also benefits soils of a clayey nature through its ability to cement\r\ntogether the fine clay particles and in that way create air spaces so\r\ngreatly needed in tight clay soils. Lime is beneficial, too, in the case\r\nof soils which have a large proportion of sand or large particles, and\r\nserves as an agent in creating a better condition of tilth and of moisture\r\nretention.\r\n\r\nIt makes little difference in what form lime is applied. It may be\r\npurchased and applied in the form of ground limestone, a rock rich in\r\ncalcium which has been mechanically ground to a very great degree of\r\nfineness. It can also be applied in the form of hydrated lime. This is\r\nobtained by heating ground limestone and slaking it by adding water. A\r\ncommon example of this is the slaking of lime for whitewashing purposes.\r\nAnother good source of lime is finely ground shells of oysters or other\r\nforms of sea life which collect the calcium from sea water and deposit it\r\nin their shells.\r\n\r\n_Adjusting the Water Content of Soils._--Aside from the supplying of water\r\nby irrigation, a rather costly process under most conditions, the water\r\nresources of most soils can be greatly increased by adding to their humus\r\ncontent. Humus, which, it has been pointed out, is decaying vegetable\r\nmatter, serves as a sponge for the absorption of soil water and for\r\nunderground water supplies. Therefore, the more humus that can be plowed\r\ninto the soil, other conditions being equal, the greater is the ability of\r\nthe plants growing in that soil to withstand drouth. As soils are\r\ncultivated, the tendency is for the humus to become \"burned out\" and to\r\nhave a reduced moisture-holding capacity. To overcome this tendency, it is\r\nnecessary to add vegetable matter to the soil whenever it is possible.\r\nIncidentally, the incorporation of large quantities of humus in the soil\r\ncreates a condition of acidity which may call for the application of lime\r\nas a corrective.\r\n\r\nThere are many acres of land which contain too much water in the area that\r\nroots should penetrate to permit of optimum plant growth. Roots of most\r\nplants will not penetrate where there is an excess of water, and air\r\ncannot circulate where moisture is superabundant. Usually these conditions\r\nexist where the soil is of a clayey nature. The abundance of water may be\r\ncaused by the inability of surface water to percolate through the soil. It\r\nmay take so long, due to the nature of the soil, for this water to pass\r\nthrough the lower depths of subsoil that the roots of plants are destroyed\r\nby lack of oxygen. In such cases the application of lime, increasing the\r\nhumus content, and deeper plowing will be found helpful. Occasionally, the\r\ndischarge of dynamite or blasting powder in the area, if it appears to be\r\nin the form of a pocket, will break up the hard pan subsoil and permit the\r\nwater to escape. Less dependence is now being placed on this means of\r\ncorrecting a wet condition of the soil than was the case some years ago.\r\n\r\nA similar condition of overabundant water in soil may be due to the\r\npresence of springs or to a high water table. Little can be done to\r\ncorrect a condition where the water table itself is so close to the\r\nsurface as to inhibit plant growth and this is assuredly one of the\r\nfactors to be looked into before a tract is purchased. Where the surplus\r\nwater is evidently being supplied by a spring, an underdrain made of tile\r\npipe, 3 or 4 inches in diameter, can be laid as a means of conducting the\r\nwater into a ditch or adjoining drain. In laying such a drain, it should\r\nbe placed above the area where the wet soil surface is most evident. If\r\nsuch a drain is laid 18 inches to 3 feet deep above the wet area, it will\r\ncut off the water seeping down underground and carry it away. Good results\r\ncannot be secured if the drain is laid directly in the area of extreme\r\nwetness or if it does not cut off the flow of water before it reaches the\r\narea that is consistently too wet for plant growth.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said in this brief description of soil treatment and\r\nsoil improvement, it is evident that one must live with his soil for some\r\ntime in order to understand it and to be able intelligently to correct its\r\ndeficiencies, overcome its weaknesses and make it capable of supporting\r\nplants which are desirable from the owner's point of view. In the great\r\nmajority of cases, the improvement process, while a slow one, is far from\r\nhopeless and almost any soil that is not extremely sandy or clayey can be\r\nso intelligently treated as to make it productive.\r\n\r\n_Cultivation._--Any discussion of soil treatment is not complete without\r\nmention of cultivation. Intelligent cultivation is an essential factor in\r\nsecuring adequate crops. It is interesting to recall that the word\r\n\"manure,\" which has come to mean fertilization or fertilizer, is derived\r\nfrom the Latin word \"_manus_\" meaning \"hand\" and implying \"manipulation\"\r\nof the soil, which we now call cultivation. Cultivation has been most\r\nfrequently practiced as a method of destroying weeds, thereby making all\r\nof the available plant food subject to absorption by the roots of the\r\ndesired plants and not by the intruders we call weeds. Cultivation does\r\nmore than destroy weeds, however. It opens up the soil so that air\r\ncontaining atmospheric nitrogen can penetrate it and so that the bacteria\r\nrequiring air for their best growth may have it available. Furthermore,\r\ncultivation conserves moisture and is more essential during dry periods in\r\nthe growing season than at any other time.\r\n\r\nWe know that in entering the soil the rain water follows certain channels\r\nin and around the soil particles on its way to the subsoil. When the rain\r\nhas ceased and the top layer of soil becomes dry, the tendency is for the\r\nwater to work up through these same channels to the surface, where it\r\nevaporates. Cultivation, by breaking up these channels, or capillary\r\ntubes, checks the escape of moisture into the air. It creates a blanket of\r\ndry surface soil which insulates the soil moisture from the air above. The\r\ntendency of soil moisture to reestablish capillary methods of escape makes\r\nrecultivation necessary from time to time in dry weather. Care must, of\r\ncourse, be taken that the cultivation is not harmful to roots of growing\r\nplants. If these roots are disturbed or destroyed through cultivation,\r\nmore harm than good may result because of the damage to the root systems.\r\n\r\n_Farm Power and Equipment._--Where the land area to be cultivated is\r\nlarger than the family garden some type of equipment for working the land,\r\npropelled by horse or motor, will be found desirable and in larger areas\r\nessential. One or more horses may be used where there are stabling\r\nfacilities and where arrangements can be made for the daily care and\r\nfeeding that these animals require. A horse suitable for work purposes may\r\nbe obtained for less than $200. The price will, of course, depend upon the\r\nage and physical soundness of the animal, but should not exceed $150 for a\r\nphysically sound animal under ten years old. A person unskilled in the\r\nassessing of animal values should obtain the services of a veterinarian or\r\nan experienced horseman in making a selection. A horse for this purpose\r\nshould be of quiet, tractable disposition, bred and broken for work\r\npurposes. The cost of caring for a horse for one year will approximate\r\n$125, including feed and bedding, but without labor charge.\r\n\r\nLeather harness costing $25 to $50 will be required and in addition tools,\r\nincluding a plow, a harrow, and a cultivator costing about $15 each. Other\r\nspecial equipment such as a mower will cost considerably more, depending\r\nupon the type used.\r\n\r\nIf the members of the family are fond of animals and willing to assume the\r\nresponsibility for their daily care, the horse will be found an efficient\r\nand useful source of power for tilling the land. In this connection it\r\nshould be pointed out that flies breed with great rapidity in the strawy\r\nmanure of the stable, and such wastes should be spread upon the land\r\nalmost daily or treated to prevent fly-breeding.\r\n\r\n_Tractor Power._--Just as large tractors have supplanted horses and\r\nhorse-drawn equipment on thousands of farms in the United States, the\r\nso-called garden tractor has become increasingly popular for the tilling\r\nof small acreages. The tractor requires \"feed\" only when it is working, is\r\nnot subject to the ills that beset animals, and may be used for\r\ntwenty-four hours a day if necessary. It makes an appeal to the\r\nmechanically minded members of the household and, if properly cared for,\r\nwill give economical and lasting service.\r\n\r\nThe usual type of garden tractor consists of two large wheels with lugs on\r\nthem to give traction and is driven by a one- or two-cylinder motor. A\r\nplow, a cultivator, or mower may be attached to the drawbar, the operator\r\nwalking behind and regulating the speed and guiding the outfit by handles\r\nprovided for the purpose. Earlier types of these machines were not always\r\nsatisfactory owing to construction weaknesses and occasionally balky\r\nmotors. Those now on the market, however, are greatly improved, require\r\nless attention, and rival their big brothers, the powerful farm tractors,\r\nin dependability.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of types and makes of garden tractors now on the\r\nmarket, ranging in price from $175 or less to $400, the cost depending\r\nlargely upon the size and capacity of the motor. In selecting a\r\nsatisfactory garden tractor attention should be directed to the simplicity\r\nand power of the motor, the type of bearings, the method of lubrication of\r\nall moving parts, the working speed and the economy of fuel. Bearings\r\nought to be of standard, long-wearing type since these are subject to hard\r\nservice. Two speeds are desirable, a slow one for heavy duty and a faster\r\none for lighter work. The tractor should operate all day on about 2\r\ngallons of gasoline and a quart of oil. In addition to power applied at\r\nthe drawbar where special tools are attached, a pulley will be found a\r\ndesirable accessory for operating belt machinery such as small feed mills,\r\npumps, and cream separators. The rating of the motor should be not less\r\nthan 3 horsepower at the drawbar for the ordinary tasks it will be called\r\nupon to perform.\r\n\r\nAll types of attachments are available for the garden tractor. These\r\ninclude plows, disks, harrows, cultivators, mowers, fertilizer\r\ndistributors, planters, sowers and seeding accessories. The prices of\r\nthese vary according to make and quality. Levers are provided for\r\nadjusting the depth of plowing, cultivating and seeding. Some of the large\r\ntype garden tractors are equipped with a seat on a sulky attached to the\r\nmachine so that the operator can ride and have complete control over speed\r\nand the type of work he wishes to do. A modern garden tractor will be\r\nfound very useful in taking care of a lawn or garden. In the case of\r\nlarger areas under cultivation, but not of field size, this type of\r\nmachine is rapidly gaining popularity for performing efficiently and\r\neconomically the numerous jobs that are to be done on every small farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do's_\r\n\r\nSelect a soil type that is inherently productive, fertile, retentive of\r\nmoisture and easily cultivated.\r\n\r\nSupplement soil fertility by adding chemical fertilizers either singly or\r\nin combination.\r\n\r\nBuy mixed fertilizers on the basis of guaranteed analyses.\r\n\r\nUse legumes (peas, beans, etc.) to add nitrogen to soils and increase\r\nhumus content.\r\n\r\nAdd specific bacteria for the production of various legumes.\r\n\r\nUse manure and green crops to supply humus.\r\n\r\nApply lime when soil test shows need for it as plant food and general soil\r\nimprover.\r\n\r\nPractice methods that make soils absorptive of moisture and permit escape\r\nof excess water.\r\n\r\nCultivate the soil to check escape of moisture and to kill weeds.\r\n\r\nUse a horse or garden tractor for cultivation of areas larger than the\r\nfamily garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don'ts_\r\n\r\nDon't buy land that is continually wet and swampy.\r\n\r\nDon't expect to produce satisfactory crops on soils that are extremely\r\nheavy or clayey or so sandy as to quickly lose moisture and fertility.\r\n\r\nDon't try to produce crops without maintaining the humus supply in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nDon't neglect cultivation as a means of conserving moisture, destroying\r\nweeds and stimulating root growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ VII\r\n\r\nFOOD FROM THE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home vegetable garden should supply an important part of the food for\r\nevery family living in the country. Vegetables that are of the right\r\nvarieties and that are fresh and properly prepared are nutritious,\r\nwholesome and economical. Not only does the well-organized home garden\r\nreduce the cost of feeding the family, but it constitutes an effective\r\nmethod of maintaining better health among all members of the household.\r\nEven common vegetables that are grown from the best varieties and served\r\nfresh will be a revelation to those accustomed to buying them in stores.\r\nDeterioration in quality and palatability begins immediately in vegetables\r\nwhen they are harvested. The more perishable the commodity, the greater is\r\nthe rate of deterioration.\r\n\r\nThe commercial vegetable grower usually inclines toward varieties that are\r\ncapable of producing a heavy yield per acre or that stand shipment and\r\ntemporary storage with the least apparent loss from deterioration. In\r\norder to have his products reach the consumer in an attractive condition,\r\nthe commercial grower usually must harvest them before they are at their\r\nbest. The channels through which vegetables and fruits pass on their way\r\nto the city consumer are devious, slow and costly. Such a consumer\r\ntherefore usually receives so-called fresh products that have been removed\r\nfrom the plant or the soil before maturity is attained and after such\r\nalready poor quality has deteriorated through aging processes.\r\n\r\nAll these disadvantages of vegetables purchased in the city are eliminated\r\nby the possessor of a garden where he may produce his family's needs (and\r\nthey are genuine needs) in the way of fresh vegetables. These products are\r\nessential in supplying such necessary elements as minerals, vitamins,\r\nacids, and cellulose. Dietary authorities advise that leafy vegetables,\r\nsometimes called \"greens,\" contain food elements not found in root\r\nvegetables. For the maintenance of health, the diet should include a\r\nvariety of vegetables besides potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Assets of a Garden._--A garden is a source of recreation, pleasure and\r\nsatisfaction to every member of the family. Real enjoyment can be had by\r\nworking in it a little time each day. To those whose work may be sedentary\r\nand of a routine nature, the garden furnishes a source of inspiration\r\nand adventure. Daily evidences of plant growth and the novelty of having\r\nvegetables of one's own growing stimulate interest in it. The garden is an\r\naid in maintaining health through physical exercise and the liberal\r\nconsumption of the fruits of labor. There is no other avenue of activity\r\nthat can afford so much in the way of health, economical recreation and\r\npleasure as a well-planned garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy New Jersey Agricultural Extension Service_)\r\n\r\nThe well-planned garden furnishes food throughout the year for the entire\r\nfamily.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving decided on a garden, the question immediately arises as to the\r\nprocedure to be followed to get the most out of it. Special attention has\r\nbeen given to this problem by experts throughout the country and specific\r\nrecommendations are now available on the subject at state agricultural\r\ncolleges. These cover varieties, planting dates, adequate area,\r\nfertilization, rotation of crops and storage. Typical recommendations\r\nalong these lines are given here for the north-central and eastern states.\r\nReaders living elsewhere may wish to check them with the practices\r\nrecommended by authorities in their home states.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable Growing by Rule._--The most effective method of presenting the\r\nstory of recommended vegetables, desirable varieties, seed required,\r\naverage yields and other pertinent data is in tabular form, such as that\r\nused in Table I, which has been prepared for the aid of home vegetable\r\ngardeners by the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, and which is\r\nbased on years of study of the subject. Table II, prepared by the Michigan\r\nState College of Agriculture, shows the amount of seed that should be\r\npurchased to supply an adequate quantity and variety of important\r\nvegetables for a family of six persons.\r\n\r\nExamination of the planting table will show that the setting of plants or\r\nroots is occasionally recommended instead of the use of seed. This is\r\ndesirable in some cases to get quicker results and in other cases is\r\nessential if a crop is to be secured during a normal growing season. While\r\nit is possible for the grower to raise these plants, or sets, himself,\r\nusually more satisfactory results can be obtained through buying them from\r\na capable plant grower. The growing of sets is a specialized business\r\nrequiring conditions of heat, moisture, fertility and skill, frequently\r\nbeyond the patience and capacity of the amateur. There are plant growers\r\nin nearly every neighborhood who will grow the needed plants at small\r\ncost. Arrangements should be made in advance for growing the varieties or\r\nstrains that are wanted, and usually the grower can furnish his own seed\r\nfor the plants if that seems desirable to him. One desiring to grow one's\r\nown plants from seed can secure full information from a practical grower\r\nor from state and county agricultural agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\nPLANTING TABLE FOR VEGETABLES[1]\r\n\r\n  -----------------+----------------------+-------+-------+------------+\r\n                   |                      |       |       |  Distance  |\r\n                   |                      |       |       |  between   |\r\n                   |                      |  Seed | Depth |  rows for  |\r\n    Name of        |        Variety       |  for  |to sow |cultivation,|\r\n    vegetable      |                      |  100- | seed, |  inches    |\r\n                   |                      |  row  |inches |            |\r\n                   |                      |       |       +------+-----+\r\n                   |                      |       |       |Horse | Hand|\r\n  -----------------+----------------------+-------+-------+------+-----+\r\n  Asparagus        |Washington, Palmetto  |1-yr.- |8-10   | 5 ft.|4 ft.|\r\n                   |                      |old    |roots  |      |     |\r\n                   |                      |roots  |       |      |     |\r\n  Beans            |                      |       |       |      |     |\r\n    Green bush     |Stringless Green Pod, |1/2 pt.|1-1-1/2|   30 |  18 |\r\n                   |Bountiful             |       |       |      |     |\r\n                   |                      |       |       |      |     |\r\n    Yellow bush    |Currie's Rust Proof,  |1/2 pt.|1-1-1/2|   30 |  18 |\r\n                   |Davis' White Wax      |       |       |      |     |\r\n                   |                      |       |       |      |     |\r\n    Pole green     |Kentucky Wonder,      |1/2 pt.|1-1-1/2|   36 |  30 |\r\n                   |Old Homestead         |       |       |      |     |\r\n    Bush lima      |Fordhook              |1/2 pt.|1-1-1/2|   30 |  30 |\r\n                   |                      |       |       |      |     |\r\n    Pole lima      |King of the Garden    |1/2 pt.|1-1-1/2|   48 |  36 |\r\n  Beets--early     |Crosby's Egyptian     |1 oz.  |   1   |   28 |  15 |\r\n         Late      |Detroit Dark Red      |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Cabbage--early   |Jersey Wakefield,     |1 pkt. |    1/2|   30 |  30 |\r\n                   |Copenhagen Market     |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Cabbage--late    |Danish Ball Head,     |1 pkt. |    1/2|   36 |  30 |\r\n                   |Succession,           |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Cantaloupe       |Early Knight,         |1/2 oz.|   1   |54-60 |  40 |\r\n                   |Fordhook              |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Carrots          |Chantenay,            |1 oz.  |    1/2|   30 |  15 |\r\n                   |Oxheart               |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Celery           |Golden Self-blanching,|1 pkt. |    1/4|   36 |  30 |\r\n                   |Easy Blanching        |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Corn--early      |Golden Bantam,        |1/4 lb.|   1   |    36|   30|\r\n                   |Howling Mob           |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Corn--late       |Golden Bantam,        |1/4 lb.|   1   |    36|   30|\r\n                   |Evergreen             |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Cucumber         |White Spine,          |1/2 oz.|1/2-1  | 48-60|   48|\r\n                   |Davis Perfect         |       |       |      |     |\r\n                   |                      |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Eggplant         |New York Improved,    |1 pkt. |    1/2|    48|   48|\r\n                   |Black Beauty          |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Endive           |Green Curled, Broad   |1 pkt. |    1/2|    30|   18|\r\n                   |Leaved Batavian       |       |       |      |     |\r\n  Kale             |Scotch Curled,        |1 pkt. |    1/2|    30|   18|\r\n                   |Siberian (over winter)|       |       |      |     |\r\n  Kohlrabi         |White Vienna          |1 pkt. |    1/2|    30|   15|\r\n  Lettuce          |                      |       |       |      |     |\r\n    Spring and fall|Green-leaved Big Bos. |1 pkt. |    1/2| 18-20|   15|\r\n    Summer         | N.

are a few essential points to be kept in mind. The time to\r\nplan the garden is in winter when adequate consideration can be given to\r\nthe selection of those vegetables that the family likes best and can use\r\nin large amounts. Seeds required should be ordered early for the entire\r\ngarden. By drawing the plan of the garden on paper and following it, the\r\nprocedure is simplified and the most efficient results attained.\r\n\r\nVegetables should be planted in rows rather than in beds, and those\r\nmaturing at about the same time should be grouped together to facilitate\r\nsuccession planting. After the early-maturing crops have been harvested,\r\nother crops can be sown on the same area, thus fully utilizing the land\r\nthroughout the growing season. Perennial crops, including asparagus and\r\nrhubarb, should be kept by themselves.\r\n\r\nA practical farmer wanting to express perfection in soil preparation is\r\napt to say, \"It is just like a garden.\" This implies good fertility,\r\noptimum moisture conditions and proper tilth. To attain these conditions\r\nin garden soil it is desirable to cover it with strawy manure some time\r\nprevious to plowing, in order that rains may carry the soluble fertility\r\nelements into the surface inches of the soil. In the early spring a\r\nthorough job of plowing or spading should be done to reasonable depth,\r\ncompletely covering the surface straw or dead plants. Every two or three\r\nyears lime should be applied after plowing and worked into the top soil at\r\nthe rate of 1 pound of hydrated lime to every 25 square feet of soil.\r\n\r\n_Fertilizing and Culture._--The fertility supplied through application of\r\nmanure should be supplemented by the use of commercial fertilizer. This\r\ncan be purchased in burlap bags from local supply agencies and should\r\ncontain about 5 per cent nitrogen, 8 per cent phosphoric acid and 7 per\r\ncent potash. Moderate variations in analysis from 5-8-7, as above, are not\r\nimportant so long as the amounts of each element are well balanced. The\r\nfertilizer should be broadcast over the garden after plowing, at the rate\r\nof 1 pound to every 25 square feet and worked into the soil before\r\nplanting. Poultry or sheep manure may be used as top dressing to alternate\r\nwith commercial fertilizer. It should be borne in mind that such animal\r\nmanures are richer in nitrogen than in other elements and if used to\r\nexcess may stimulate leaf growth at the expense of yield and quality.\r\n\r\nFrequent shallow cultivations are desirable. The ordinary wheel hoe will\r\nbe found helpful in the cultivating procedure. It should be well\r\nunderstood that cultivation is essential to prevent weed growth and\r\nconserve moisture.\r\n\r\nIf watering or irrigating is necessary in dry weather, it should be\r\nthoroughly done. One soaking of the soil to a depth of 4 to 6 inches is\r\nfar more effective than frequent light sprinklings. The latter may be more\r\nharmful than beneficial through reestablishing capillary movement,\r\npermitting the escape of subsoil moisture. Water should be applied under\r\nthe same conditions that apply when rain falls--on cloudy days or after\r\nsunset to prevent \"baking\" or encrusting of the surface soil as well as to\r\nconserve the amount of water needed.\r\n\r\n_Meeting the Insect Problem._--The sponsor of a garden in which\r\ndiversified vegetables are grown must be prepared to meet the onslaught of\r\nequally diversified insect species. While it is true that insects are\r\nmultiplying as to species and voraciousness, it is equally true that\r\nmethods of control are becoming available to cope adequately with most of\r\nthem. One unfamiliar with our insect infestations will be amazed to find\r\nthat certain species apparently have had advance notice of his intentions\r\nand are sitting about the planted rows awaiting the appearance of the\r\ntender shoots.\r\n\r\nOne of the best methods of combating insects is to create ideal conditions\r\nfor plant growth. Plants that are underfed through inadequate soil\r\nfertility or are weakened by other causes suffer severely from insect\r\nattack, while vigorous plants will come through with much less damage. It\r\nis advisable to insure rapid germination of seed through careful soil\r\npreparation, to seed at the proper time for a quick and vigorous start and\r\nto have sufficient available fertility to stimulate growth once the plants\r\nhave started.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct classes of insects, the division being based upon\r\ntheir feeding habits. The larger group, both in the size of the insects\r\nthemselves and in the number of species, is the leaf-chewing group. These\r\ncan be destroyed by the application of stomach poisons to the plants under\r\nattack. The other group consists of the sucking insects, which penetrate\r\nthe veins carrying nourishment to the leaves and appropriate it for\r\nthemselves. Such insects multiply with extreme rapidity, generally feed on\r\nthe underside of the leaves and may cause complete wilting of the plant\r\nbefore their presence is suspected. In such cases a \"contact\" spray or\r\ndust must be used. This is based on the principle of causing the insect to\r\n\"inhale\" the material through breathing pores along its body. The\r\ninsecticide must be composed of extremely fine particles or must be of\r\nsuch an oily nature that it will readily penetrate such pores. In\r\naddition to these, certain repellent materials are being developed which\r\ncause the insect to seek food where the disagreeable conditions do not\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL INSECTS AND REMEDIES[3]\r\n\r\n  -----------------+--------------+---------------+---------------------\r\n   Plants attacked |   Chewing    |   Character   |      Treatment\r\n                   |   insects    |   of damage   |\r\n  -----------------+--------------+---------------+---------------------\r\n  Tomato, pepper,  |Flea Beetles  |They gnaw or   |Dust or spray with\r\n  eggplant, turnip,|              |eat small holes|a prepared nicotine\r\n  cabbage, etc.    |              |in the leaves. |or pyrethrum mixture.\r\n                   |              |               |Bordeaux mixture\r\n                   |              |               |sprayed, or dusting\r\n                   |              |               |for disease is also\r\n                   |              |               |effective as\r\n                   |              |               |a repellent.\r\n                   |              |               |\r\n                   |              |               |\r\n  Asparagus        |Asparagus     |Feeds on the   |Dust with either\r\n                   |Beetle        |shoots and     |arsenate of lead or\r\n                   |              |brush.         |calcium arsenate,\r\n                   |              |               |mixed with 1 part of\r\n                   |              |               |wheat flour.

Where\r\nno fruit trees are growing the best plan is to set out individual trees or\r\nbush fruits of the standard types and varieties, adding to the collection\r\nlater as the needs of the family develop and the adaptability of the area\r\nfor varieties manifests itself through crop production.\r\n\r\nAll fruits thrive best on a deep, well-drained soil. It is difficult to\r\nsecure good results where the area is depressed and air drainage is poor.\r\nElevation of the area planted is desirable therefore from the standpoint\r\nof both water and air drainage.\r\n\r\nA number of questions confront the prospective grower of fruits. He needs\r\nto know, among other things, the kind of fruit to plant, the necessary\r\ndistance between the trees or plants and the probable yield. The following\r\nplanting guide will be found helpful in answering these questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME FRUITS AND BEES\r\n\r\nPLANTING GUIDE[4]\r\n\r\n  -------+----------------+--------+--------+-------------------------\r\n  Average|                |        |        |\r\n  number |                |        |        |     Estimated yield\r\n    of   |                |Distance|Distance|       at maturity\r\n  plants |  Kind of fruit |between |between +------------+------------\r\n    to   |                |  rows, | plants,|  Average   |   Average\r\n    the  |                |  feet  | feet   |  per acre  |  per plant\r\n   acre  |                |        |        |            |\r\n  -------+----------------+--------+--------+------------+------------\r\n      27 |Apples          |  40    |   40   |135 bushels |  5 bushels\r\n      90 |Pears           |  22    |   22   |90 bushels  |  1 bushel\r\n     200 |Quinces         |  16    |   16   |100 bushels |1/2 bushel\r\n      90 |Peaches         |  22    |   22   |90 bushels  |  1 bushel\r\n      90 |Nectarines      |  22    |   22   |90 bushels  |  1 bushel\r\n      90 |Plums           |  22    |   22   |90 bushels  |  1 bushel\r\n      90 |Cherries (sour) |  22    |   22   |90 bushels  |  1 bushel\r\n      48 |Cherries (sweet)|  30    |   30   |50 bushels  |  1 bushel\r\n   6,000 |Strawberries    | 3-1/2  |    2   |2,250 quarts|  3/4 pint\r\n         | (matted row)   |        |        |            |   per stool\r\n   1,800 |Raspberries     |   8    |    3   |2,000 quarts|  1 quart\r\n   1,800 |Blackberries    |   8    |    3   |2,400 quarts|1-1/4 quarts\r\n   1,200 |Dewberries      |   6    |    6   |1,800 quarts|  1 quart\r\n         | (hill system)  |        |        |            |\r\n   1,800 |Gooseberries    |   8    |    3   |5,400 quarts|  3 quarts\r\n   1,800 |Currants        |   8    |    3   |3,600 quarts|  2 quarts\r\n     680 |Grapes          |   8    |    8   |4,000 pounds|  6 pounds\r\n  -------+----------------+--------+--------+------------+------------\r\n\r\nThe selection of varieties of tree fruits is highly important. Some sorts\r\nare preeminently adapted to home use because of their high quality of\r\nedibility while others are preferred for commercial production on account\r\nof their good shipping qualities and high yields per acre. It is advisable\r\nfor the grower to inquire of his state agricultural college regarding\r\nvarieties to plant. Responsible nursery firms will also advise on\r\nvarieties that will best meet the needs of the purchaser from the\r\nstandpoint of family use and adaptability to soil and climatic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe following varieties are recommended for general home use in\r\nnorth-central areas of the United States, subject to check by local\r\nauthorities. The apple and peach varieties are given in the order of\r\nripening.\r\n\r\n  Apples:\r\n    William\r\n    Wealthy\r\n    McIntosh\r\n    Rome\r\n    Stayman\r\n  Peaches (all freestone):\r\n    Golden Jubilee\r\n    Georgia Belle\r\n    Elberta\r\n    J. H. Hale\r\n  Pears:\r\n    Bartlett\r\n    Seckel\r\n  Cherries:\r\n    Montmorency or Early Richmond (sour)\r\n    Black Tartarian (sweet)\r\n  Plums:\r\n    Damson (blue)\r\n    Burbank (red)\r\n\r\nAbout fifty strawberry plants will be needed for a row 100 feet long.\r\nBecause of weed infestations in old beds, it will be more satisfactory to\r\nset a new row each year and destroy the old one. The plants during the\r\nseason of setting should be trained to form a matted row about 2 feet\r\nwide. Mulching the plants after a freeze in the fall with straw or other\r\nsimilar material will prevent injury caused by \"heaving\" of the soil.\r\n\r\nCurrants and gooseberries should be pruned annually and only the one- or\r\ntwo-year-old wood retained for production. Thinning out in this manner\r\nwill give better size and quality. Where the currant worm is troublesome\r\nthe foliage should be dusted with arsenate of lead or Paris green as soon\r\nas it is well developed and before the fruit is started. About thirty\r\ncurrant or gooseberry plants will be needed for a 100-foot row, and they\r\ncan be planted along a fence or other boundary line.\r\n\r\nBlackberries and raspberries should be set 3 feet apart in the row, 100\r\nfeet requiring thirty to thirty-five plants. Old canes should be pruned\r\nout after fruiting and the weaker new canes should be removed when\r\ndormant, leaving 6 or 8 inches between the standing canes. Lateral\r\nbranches should be cut back in early spring to about 1 foot in length and\r\nthe upright canes cut back to uninjured wood, thus removing about\r\ntwo-thirds of the growth.\r\n\r\nGrapes need severe pruning to produce satisfactory yields of good quality.\r\nThis is best done in late winter. It is a good plan to prune so that from\r\n15 to 30 or possibly 40 buds are left on each mature vine, depending upon\r\nthe vitality of the plant. Two or three clusters of fruit will develop on\r\nthe shoot that grows from each bud. A 100-foot row of grapes will require\r\ntwelve plants. There are many fine varieties of grapes and several can be\r\nused in a single row.\r\n\r\nIn ordering stock for planting, care should be exercised in making sure of\r\nthe reliability of the nursery. As a general rule it is better to order\r\nfrom a nursery in the vicinity, thus eliminating losses due to shipping\r\ngreat distances and also making sure that the varieties or strains were\r\ngrown for use in the area in question. Upon the arrival of the stock from\r\nthe nursery, it should be \"heeled in\" at once. That is, the roots should\r\nbe covered in a trench so that they will not dry out before they can be\r\nplanted in the desired location. In the case of a few trees that can be\r\nset immediately, this is not necessary.\r\n\r\nNearly all country places have sufficient area for planting small fruits\r\nand, as is the case with vegetables, freshness and fine-flavored varieties\r\nwill compensate for the labor involved in growing them. Strawberries,\r\ncurrants, gooseberries, blackberries, red and black raspberries and grapes\r\nare especially desirable for home plantings. Some high-quality varieties\r\nare given for the choice of the home owner, subject to confirmation by\r\nauthorities acquainted with specific conditions and intended primarily for\r\nhome use.\r\n\r\n  Strawberries (in order of ripening):\r\n    Howard 17\r\n    Fairfax\r\n    Aberdeen\r\n    Joe\r\n    Chesapeake\r\n    Mastodon is recommended for the everbearing type.\r\n  Currants:\r\n    Fay\r\n    Wilder\r\n  Gooseberries:\r\n    Chautauqua\r\n    Poorman\r\n  Blackberries:\r\n    Russell\r\n    Ward\r\n    Eldorado for bush types\r\n    Black Diamond for the trailing type requiring a trellis and\r\n     ripening late in the season.\r\n  Red Raspberries (in order of ripening):\r\n    Ranere\r\n    Viking\r\n    Latham\r\n  Black Raspberries:\r\n    Cumberland\r\n    Quillen\r\n  Grapes (general list, in order of ripening):\r\n    Ontario (white)\r\n    Fredonia (black)\r\n    Delaware (red)\r\n    Brighton (red)\r\n    Golden Muscat (white)\r\n    Concord (blue)\r\n    Sheridan (black)\r\n    For those desiring a succession of blue-black varieties,\r\n      Fredonia, Concord and Sheridan are recommended.\r\n\r\n_Controlling Insect and Fungous Pests._--Plant pests of various kinds\r\ninfest tree fruits and small fruits. In general, the best method of\r\ncontrolling leaf-chewing insects is by applying arsenate of lead on the\r\nfoliage. Care must be taken to avoid staining the fruit with poisonous\r\nspray or thorough washing will be necessary before it is safe to consume.\r\nThe control of other insect pests and fungous plant diseases has been well\r\nworked out by agricultural experiment stations throughout the country, and\r\nthese methods should be sought before attempting any campaign of\r\nsuppression. A barrel spray pump, mounted on a hand truck or on a vehicle,\r\nequipped with plenty of hose will be found satisfactory for spraying\r\nplantings of modest size.\r\n\r\n_Rejuvenating an Old Orchard._--The purchaser of an old-established farm\r\nwill usually find he has acquired some apple trees of uncertain age and\r\nhealth. In many instances these trees can be renovated and rejuvenated so\r\nthat they will again bear fruit. If the trees have several sound limbs and\r\nare making some growth each year, they may be considered worth saving. On\r\nthe other hand, broken tops and limbs accompanied by large rotted cavities\r\nwill create too great an expense if an attempt is made to restore them to\r\nusefulness. The varieties should be determined before serious efforts at\r\nrenovation are undertaken, so that the strenuous work necessary for\r\nrestoration may not be wasted on undesirable fruit.\r\n\r\n_Steps in Renovation._--The first operation in renovation is pruning. Most\r\nof this should be done in early spring during the dormant season and\r\nsupplemented in June or July when the trees are in leaf. Large broken\r\nlimbs and dead wood should be removed, together with interfering branches,\r\nand those reaching too high should be headed back. At about the same time\r\nthat pruning is started the loose bark should be thoroughly scraped off\r\nand burned, thus destroying insects and fungi that attack the fruit.\r\nHarboring places for further infestations are also thus removed. If the\r\ntrees are badly in need of pruning, it is best to do the job over a period\r\nof two or three years rather than all at one time, due to the tendency of\r\ntrees to \"sucker\" and develop a multiplicity of small non-bearing\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nSpraying, fertilizing and cultivation, where that is possible, should\r\nfollow the pruning and scraping jobs. Spray schedules and cultural\r\npractices best adapted to the region can be obtained without cost by\r\napplying to state or county agricultural agencies. Ordinarily two or three\r\nyears are required to rejuvenate these trees and begin to secure a crop.\r\nProduction will then increase in quantity and quality during succeeding\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n_Bees as Pollinators._--The production of fruits of all kinds is dependent\r\nupon pollination of their blossoms by bees and other winged insects. Bees\r\nof many species are useful in pollen distribution, but the most important\r\nis the honey bee, which is available in larger numbers just at flowering\r\ntime, seeking nectar from the flowers. In large commercial orchards\r\ncolonies of honey bees are set at regular intervals to insure adequate\r\npollination, usually one hive per acre.\r\n\r\nA practical method of adding to county life enjoyment and adding to income\r\nas well is the keeping of bees for honey production.\r\n\r\n_Securing a Honey Crop._--Bee husbandry can be carried on successfully as\r\na specialized side line where only small areas of land are available.\r\nColonies can be located at one side of the garden or placed under trees\r\nwhere they will not be disturbed either through accident or by cultivation\r\nof the plot immediately surrounding them. The activity of the bees during\r\nthe nectar-gathering season, accompanied by the well-known hum as they\r\ndart in and out of the hive, makes a genuine appeal to the country\r\ndweller. This appeal is heightened by the fact that they are working for\r\nhim, in part at least, and without his having to pay for their raiding the\r\nnectar from the flowers around. He knows that his efforts in providing\r\nfavorable working conditions for the bees will be repaid by a harvest of\r\nsalable honey. A colony at full strength just at the right time will\r\ninvariably gather a surplus.\r\n\r\n_First Principles in Beekeeping._--The beginner in bee husbandry should\r\npurchase established colonies from a reputable business concern or from\r\nbeekeepers in the neighborhood of his home. He should begin in a small way\r\nwith a few colonies, learn the business with a small investment and then\r\nincrease as his liking for the work develops and the market for the\r\nproduct expands. Being able to read the signs at the entrance to the hive\r\nis the surest way to success. Too much manipulation is just as harmful as\r\nneglect. The novice in beekeeping who is really interested and follows\r\ncarefully a few details gained from a reliable bee book should harvest at\r\nleast 30 pounds of honey a year from each colony. Experts get much larger\r\nyields and have been known to secure 200 pounds per colony and 200\r\nsections of comb honey from one hive. The deciding factor in producing\r\nhoney is the skill of the watchful beekeeper, assuming of course that\r\nthere is a sufficient supply of nectar-secreting blossoms in the area.\r\n\r\nThe cost of engaging in bee husbandry is nominal. An established colony of\r\nthe preferred Italian bees should cost about $8. The equipment should\r\ninclude two fitted supers for each colony in which the bees may store the\r\nhoney, costing about $3 each; a veil to protect the head and face,\r\nlinseed-oil-soaked canvas gloves, a bee smoker, a hive tool and a bee\r\nescape (needed for removing the bees from filled supers), each item\r\ncosting less than a dollar. An additional piece of apparatus, a queen\r\n\"excluder,\" is needed for each hive, to keep the queen in the lower\r\nchamber and prevent the mixing of stored honey surplus and developing\r\nbees.\r\n\r\nThe principal nectar-secreting plants are the clovers, sumac, buckwheat,\r\ncranberry and blueberry blossoms, goldenrod, asters and mallows. Since\r\nthese plants bloom at varying periods during the growing season, the\r\nbeekeeper will find it necessary to adjust his operations in accordance\r\nwith the nectar-producing capacity of his own region. The experience of\r\nsuccessful beekeepers will be found helpful as a guide in taking the\r\nsuccessive and orderly steps necessary to secure maximum honey crops. In\r\nmany states there are associations of beekeepers formed for mutual\r\nadvantage and the promotion of the industry. The novice can hardly expect\r\nto learn unless he affiliates himself with such groups and attends their\r\nmeetings. Subscription to a good bee journal is also desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonies of honey bees located near the source of nectar\r\nsupply.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Selling the Product._--Honey can be marketed in the comb or in glass jars\r\nin the extracted or crystal form. Many suburban beekeepers dispose of\r\ntheir crop in their own neighborhood or at roadside stands. Many food\r\nproducts are being promoted which contain honey as one ingredient, and\r\nthis opens an attractive field to the resourceful beekeeper. The healthful\r\nqualities of honey for human consumption are being given greater\r\nrecognition and it appears that the market for locally produced honey of\r\nhigh quality is steadily expanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do's_\r\n\r\nFruit trees should be included in every country homeowner's plan.\r\n\r\nBe sure varieties are such as will yield, plentifully, good quality fruit.\r\n\r\nUse bush fruits as ornamentals and sources of food to be put in cans.\r\n\r\nSeek advice on fruit problems from the state agricultural college.\r\n\r\nOld orchards may be rejuvenated under proper systems of management.\r\n\r\nUse colonies of bees to pollinate fruit blossoms and to produce honey.\r\n\r\nBegin bee husbandry in a small way at first and get advice from\r\nexperienced bee culturists.\r\n\r\nSell surplus honey in home markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don'ts_\r\n\r\nDon't plant varieties of fruits that are ill adapted to climatic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nDon't overlook the necessity of preparing for insect attacks in advance of\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nDon't establish bee colonies without making sure that proper care of them\r\ncan be taken.\r\n\r\nDon't try to practice horticulture or bee husbandry without frequently\r\nobtaining expert advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ IX\r\n\r\nPOULTRY AS A SOURCE OF INCOME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of the owners of small farm properties are interested in the\r\npossibilities of poultry keeping as a means of adding to the family\r\nincome. Efforts in this direction are logical from a number of angles. For\r\nexample, the keeping of poultry appeals to them as an interesting line of\r\nwork for the sake of the activity itself. Furthermore, the cost of housing\r\na comparatively large number of laying hens is not expensive, as compared\r\nwith the investment required in other agricultural enterprises. Again,\r\nthere is a ready market for the eggs and for the poultry in the\r\nneighborhood where the enterprise is carried on. No doubt, too, the more\r\nor less fabulous stories of easy profits have stimulated a desire to get\r\ninto this business and to make it a rather important source of income.\r\nAgain, there is the thought that the work involved in feeding and caring\r\nfor the flock can be carried on by another member of the family when the\r\nowner or principal bread-winner is engaged in some other activity\r\ntemporarily.\r\n\r\nAll these factors have tended to develop in the mind of the settler in the\r\ncountry a pretty definite idea that he can supplement the family income\r\nwith poultry. Sometimes this idea is erroneous and there is apt to be\r\nlittle definite knowledge on the part of the new owner as to costs,\r\nproblems and profits that are likely to accrue. It is the thought of the\r\nwriter to outline some definite recommendations for the prospective\r\npoultryman which will enable him to safeguard his investment and prevent\r\nthe very serious losses that have occurred to many who have not taken into\r\nconsideration all of the factors involved.\r\n\r\n_Soil Type._--The prospective poultryman will, if he is wise, make sure\r\nthat the soil is adapted to the project. The ideal soil for poultry\r\nraising is sufficiently porous to furnish good water drainage and yet not\r\nso open or sandy as to be incapable of crop production. A porous soil is\r\nwarmer than a clay soil and is more conducive to good sanitation through\r\npermitting moisture and debris to be carried quickly to the subsoil. If\r\nthe subsoil is of a gravelly nature the natural condition will be\r\nimproved. Presumably the same type of soil that will bear the poultry\r\nplant should be capable of producing garden crops, growing shade or fruit\r\ntrees satisfactorily and producing grass and short-rooted crops that can\r\nbe used in conjunction with the poultry plant or the beautification of the\r\nhome surroundings. Consequently, the soil type must be productive and\r\ncapable of improvement while being well drained and conducive to good\r\nsanitation. Heavy clay soils or those with rock strata close to the\r\nsurface are to be avoided.\r\n\r\nSuccessful poultry farms are operated on both level and rolling lands.\r\nExtremely flat topography should be avoided and also precipitous slopes.\r\nIf the site is on rolling land the poultry plant should be located on a\r\nslope with southern exposure to secure warmth, quicker drying conditions\r\nand protection from cold north winds.\r\n\r\n_Breeds of Poultry._--Fowls have been domesticated and bred for ages all\r\nover the world. As the result of various crossings a large number of types\r\nor breeds of poultry are available for present-day use and propagation.\r\nSome of these breeds are maintained for show or novelty purposes only and\r\nfurnish an interesting field for the fancier.\r\n\r\nFor the person who is engaging in the commercial poultry business the\r\nchoice of breed narrows to a very few utility types. For purely\r\negg-producing purposes or for broilers weighing slightly over a pound at\r\nkilling time, the light Mediterranean breeds are the most efficient. Less\r\nfeed is needed for maintaining the egg machine itself and less room per\r\nbird required. Of these so-called egg breeds, the White Leghorn is in a\r\nclass by itself. This breed is noted for its large white-shelled eggs\r\nwhich top the markets where this color egg is in demand. In the most\r\nintensive egg-producing areas of the country the White Leghorn\r\npredominates. On the other hand, this breed is not a good meat producer,\r\nthe mature birds being light in weight.\r\n\r\nFor the dual purpose of egg and meat production the American breeds are\r\nthe most popular. The principal commercial types of this general purpose\r\ngroup are Plymouth Rocks, Wyandottes and Rhode Island Reds. In some\r\ninstances crosses of these breeds are proving good layers and highly\r\nefficient meat producers.\r\n\r\nThe Rocks, Wyandottes and Reds have bright yellow skin, shanks and beak\r\nwhich are desired in market poultry. They are good winter layers,\r\nparticularly, and some strains have been developed that rival the Leghorn\r\nin the number of eggs per bird. Both the White and the Barred Plymouth\r\nRocks are popular among those seeking a dual purpose breed, and being\r\nslightly heavier than White Wyandottes and Rhode Island Reds they are\r\npreferred by many poultrymen. The latter two breeds are rapidly increasing\r\nin popularity and their best qualities are being brought out more\r\nuniformly by careful selection of breeding stock in each case. All of\r\nthese American breeds lay brown eggs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the egg and the dual purpose types of poultry epitomized by\r\nthe Leghorn and the Plymouth Rock, respectively, there are breeds which\r\nare primarily meat producers. Less attention is paid to the egg-producing\r\nability of these than is the case with the others mentioned. The Brahmas,\r\nCochins and Langshans stand in high regard as economical meat producers.\r\nThe Jersey Black Giant is a more recent addition to the popular heavy\r\nbreeds, especially for the capon trade.\r\n\r\nThese Asiatic types grow slowly and are phlegmatic in movement so that\r\nthey utilize feed for the economical development of high quality meat and\r\nattain great weight. For broilers of more than 1-1/2 pounds each, for\r\nroasting chickens and for capons, the dual purpose breeds are becoming\r\nmore popular than the extremely heavy breeds due to their more rapid\r\ngrowth and more popular weight average at marketing time.\r\n\r\n_Buying Stock._--The advantages of buying and maintaining definite breeds\r\nof poultry are now so well understood that the mixed or mongrel flock is\r\nfast disappearing. Having decided which type of fowl is best adapted to\r\none's market and ideas, there is no difficulty in finding a breed that\r\nwill fit the need. As has been pointed out, the attributes of high egg\r\nproduction or fine quality of meat are inherent in certain breeds. A\r\nsingle breed means uniformity in color, size and shape of the eggs which\r\nincreases their marketability. More attractive appearance of the flock and\r\ngreater efficiency from feeding without additional cost are other\r\nadvantages pertaining to standardizing the flock as to breed.\r\n\r\nStock may be acquired as day-old chicks, as ten- to twelve-week-old\r\npullets or as adult birds ready to lay. Hatching eggs may also be bought\r\nif desired, but it will be found more satisfactory and just as economical\r\nfor the inexperienced person to buy the hatched chick or the more mature\r\nbirds. The hatching and brooding processes are fraught with difficulties\r\nwhich may be especially acute for the amateur. The greatest demand at the\r\npresent time, and properly so, is for day-old chicks. A highly specialized\r\nindustry has been developed for the purpose of supplying this demand and a\r\nreputation for reliability has been established by many concerns catering\r\nto this trade.\r\n\r\n_Poultry House Construction._--Where flocks of poultry are to be kept for\r\negg production, special laying houses must be provided in addition to\r\nbrooder houses that will be needed in any case.\r\n\r\nOne of the best types of brooder house is the two-room type developed by\r\nCornell University, Ithaca, New York. Such a house should be about 8 by 14\r\nfeet, and mounted on skids for convenience in moving. A movable partition\r\ndivides the house into two rooms. Thus a cold room is provided for\r\nexercising and a warm room for sleeping. The marked difference in\r\ntemperature between the two rooms helps to harden the chicks, while the\r\nreduced space about the hover conserves the heat.\r\n\r\nA great deal of study has been given to the construction of laying houses\r\nfor poultry. The purposes in mind have been to obtain maximum sunlight\r\nthroughout the day, protection from storms and from dampness, and adequate\r\nventilation.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of a modern laying house, 1 square foot of glass\r\nshould be provided for every 20 square feet of floor space. The windows\r\nshould be hinged so that they may be opened in warm weather. One of the\r\ncommercial glass substitutes that are now on the market may be used\r\ninstead of ordinary glass to allow violet light rays to reach the\r\nbirds. The other openings permit free circulation of air through the\r\nhouse. They should be equipped with muslin curtains to be used during\r\nstorms and in extremely cold weather. Such a house can be used the year\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy of Poultry Tribune_)\r\n\r\nThis sketch shows an end view of a practical and inexpensive shed-roof\r\nlaying house. Detailed blue prints for use in constructing such a house\r\ncan usually be obtained from county agricultural agents or state\r\nagricultural colleges.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A fine flock of layers. The hoppers furnish laying mash and\r\nthe fountains supply drinking water. Scratch grain is thrown in the\r\nlitter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe floor of the laying house must be dry at all times if vigor and health\r\nare to be maintained. During the winter there should be about 10 inches of\r\ndry litter in the form of straw, peat moss or shavings mixed with the\r\nstraw. Small windows in the rear wall will make for better distribution of\r\nthe litter, since the birds scratch away from the light.\r\n\r\n_Equipment and Appliances._--A great deal of hand labor and daily drudgery\r\ncan be eliminated by equipping the house with properly constructed\r\nappliances. These will not only save labor but will also supply the birds\r\nwith their needs at the time the need for certain materials is felt and\r\nthus contribute to health and flock efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe best method of feeding dry mash is from a hopper. This should be so\r\nconstructed as to hold a reserve supply at all times that will run into\r\nthe feed trough as it is consumed. Care should be taken in construction to\r\nprevent the birds from throwing out the mash with their beaks and thus\r\nwasting it.\r\n\r\nWater fountains of a standard type that will furnish the birds with a\r\nconstant amount of fresh water are available at poultry supply houses.\r\nReceptacles should also be provided for grit, ground oyster shell and\r\ncharcoal which can be easily filled. A sloping board should be placed over\r\nthese receptacles to prevent the birds from roosting on them and soiling\r\nthe contents.\r\n\r\nBins so constructed as to be vermin-proof and moisture-proof should be\r\navailable for storing the scratch grain and other concentrated feeds.\r\nProvision for storing litter where it can be kept clean and dry will be\r\nnecessary. If long straw is to be used, a cutter operated by hand or by a\r\nmotor will prove useful in fining the straw. The scratch grain will be\r\nspread through the litter on the floor, compelling the birds to scratch\r\nfor it and thus obtain needed exercise.\r\n\r\n_Artificial Lighting._--Modern laying houses are equipped with electric\r\nlights that are turned on and off automatically. Artificial lighting\r\nprolongs the hen's working day when the days are short, resulting in\r\ngreater food consumption and more exercise which will increase egg\r\nproduction and give better health and stamina at seasons when more eggs\r\naugment profits. A 40-watt bulb should be placed in one receptacle with\r\nreflector for each 200 square feet of floor space, located midway between\r\nthe front wall and the front line of perches.\r\n\r\n_Investment Needed for the Start._--The prospective poultryman should be\r\nfamiliar with the principal items of cost before engaging in the business.\r\nTo be thus forewarned is to be forearmed. The scale upon which one takes\r\nup commercial poultry production should depend upon experience in coping\r\nwith the industry's peculiar problems and upon the amount of capital\r\navailable. Success depends, of course, both upon skill in handling the\r\npoultry and upon the capitalization of the plant. It should be recognized\r\nthat costs can be only approximate and are usable as guides only. They\r\nwill vary according to geographical location, general economic conditions,\r\nlabor costs and the bargaining power of the individual. The figures here\r\ngiven are for a plant comprised of 1,500 laying hens--the minimum number\r\nfrom which a living can be obtained and probably the maximum number that\r\ncan be cared for by one person.\r\n\r\nThe houses for the flock will necessarily include a laying house of the\r\nmultiple unit or other similar type, which should cost about $1,000. In\r\naddition, eight brooder houses will be needed to care for the chicks and\r\ngrowing stock, costing about $100 each, or a total of $800. The growing\r\nstock when on range will need shelters for protection against hot sun and\r\nrain, and these should be built for about $25 each, or a total of $200,\r\nmaking a total cost for buildings and the necessary interior equipment\r\nabout $2,000. In addition to this item, there will be needed about $1,500\r\nfor the purchase of pullets at $1.00 each, making a grand total of $3,500.\r\n\r\nIf baby chicks are purchased, it will be necessary to buy not less than\r\n4,000 of these if the operator is to obtain 1,500 desirable laying birds.\r\nThe cost of these chicks will depend upon the breeding that is behind\r\nthem, upon whether they are blood-tested to eliminate bacillary white\r\ndiarrhea (a scourge of young chicks) and the general care that has been\r\ntaken in the hatchery to produce good, livable chicks. This care,\r\nincidentally, must extend to flocks from which the hatching eggs are\r\nsecured, as well as to the final incubating process. Chicks sold at\r\nextremely low prices are rarely bargains. Quality is far more important\r\nthan low first cost. Assuming a cost of 14 cents per chick as an average\r\nfor chicks that will produce virile, productive layers, the initial\r\ninvestment for this item will be between $500 and $600. Therefore, if\r\nchicks are purchased, it will reduce the item for stock from the amount of\r\n$1,500 given above, which would represent the cost of partly grown\r\npullets.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the complete poultry plant already stocked will cost $3,500,\r\nwe must add to the budget of the prospective poultryman a sum for the\r\npurchase of a farm of from 5 acres upward, including a residence. In most\r\nlocalities a small tract with a modest house can be purchased for about\r\n$4,000. If only the land is purchased, that should be available at $200 an\r\nacre as a subdivision of a larger tract. Assuming that a house costing\r\n$3,000 will be suitable for the operator and his family, the total outlay\r\nwill be in the neighborhood of $7,500. Experienced poultrymen estimate\r\nthat a modest poultry farm of the type above described can be put into\r\noperation for an investment of $5 per bird. If it is planned to begin with\r\na smaller flock than 1,500 individual layers, the same figures can be\r\napplied in proportion to the number of birds to be kept. In short, the\r\npoultry house and equipment should be estimated on the basis of not less\r\nthan $1.50 per bird and the cost of the farm, residence and stock will be\r\nin addition to such a charge. The allowance of $1.50 per bird provides\r\nonly for simple housing facilities for the flock.\r\n\r\nUsing these figures, it will be easy to understand the reason for the\r\ngeneral recommendation that a total investment of $10,000 is a requisite\r\nfor a poultry establishment from which a modest living can be obtained.\r\nWhile the investment in housing, land, residence and stock may not exceed\r\n$7,500, there will need to be sufficient capital for paying the living\r\nexpenses of the family until the flock begins laying and to enable the\r\noperator to purchase feed and other necessary adjuncts to his\r\nestablishment before an income is obtained.\r\n\r\nFor a flock of smaller size than the so-called maximum one-man type above\r\ndescribed, the costs per bird for the various items will apply in most\r\ncases. It is, in fact, advisable to begin with a smaller flock if the\r\nowner is inexperienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do's_\r\n\r\nPoultry keeping must be efficiently carried on to yield returns to the\r\ncountry home owner.\r\n\r\nSelect well-drained soil that is free of infection.\r\n\r\nFor egg production, use the Leghorn; for both meat and egg purposes, the\r\nAmerican breeds are best.\r\n\r\nStandardize on one breed if possible.\r\n\r\nBuy the best chicks or mature stock available.\r\n\r\nUse a brooder house for the young birds.\r\n\r\nThe laying house must be well ventilated, fully lighted and easily\r\ncleaned.\r\n\r\nUse latest mechanical feeding and watering devices to save labor.\r\n\r\nEmploy artificial lighting to lengthen the hen's working day.\r\n\r\nWork toward the \"one-man plant\"--a total of 1,500 laying hens--for most\r\nefficient results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don'ts_\r\n\r\nDon't try to raise poultry in buildings that may still carry infection.\r\n\r\nDon't economize by buying cheap chicks or breeding stock.\r\n\r\nDon't overlook importance of health factors and productive qualities in\r\ndetermining value of stock purchased.\r\n\r\nDon't try to operate a poultry plant with ill-adapted buildings and\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ X\r\n\r\nSUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF POULTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe successful poultryman will have set up his establishment with due\r\nattention to adequate housing, good stock, facilities for maintaining\r\nsanitation and for creating generally favorable conditions for egg\r\nproduction. His next problem will be that of adopting successful methods\r\nof management so that he may obtain a satisfactory net income from the\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n_Feeds and Feeding._--There are two groups of materials that are essential\r\nin food rations for all ages of poultry. The organic feeds include grains\r\nand grain by-products, hays, grasses and vegetables. The inorganic feeds\r\ninclude salt to increase palatability and digestibility of the ration;\r\nlime, to aid in building bone and body tissue as well as to furnish the\r\nshell material; bone ash, especially for growing chicks, and water in\r\nliberal amounts supplied by a fountain as well as from succulent green\r\nfoods. The fact that a dozen eggs contain approximately one pint of water\r\ndemonstrates the necessity of having drinking water before the flock at\r\nall times.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of baby chicks, young stock and laying hens has been\r\nscientifically worked out by research and practical experience over a\r\nperiod of many years. The poultryman, especially if he is a novice, will\r\ndo well if he carefully observes the recommendations of competent\r\nauthorities. The ration for each of the three ages will consist of a grain\r\nfeed and a dry mash composed of grain by-products reinforced with\r\nmaterials that supply the birds' daily nutrition requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following rations and recommendations for management have been\r\nprepared by the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, New Brunswick,\r\nNew Jersey:\r\n\r\n     CHICK RATION\r\n\r\n         Baby Chick Grain\r\n\r\n         200 pounds finely cracked yellow corn\r\n         100 pounds cracked wheat\r\n\r\n     Fed morning and evening, beginning when chicks are 36 hours old.\r\n\r\n         Baby Chick Mash\r\n\r\n         20 pounds ground yellow corn\r\n         20 pounds wheat bran\r\n         20 pounds flour middlings\r\n         20 pounds pinhead oats\r\n         10 pounds meat scrap (50 per cent protein)\r\n          5 pounds dried buttermilk or skim-milk\r\n          2 pounds oyster shell meal or limestone flour or bone meal\r\n          2 pounds cod liver oil (mixed with the pinhead oats)\r\n          1 pound table salt\r\n\r\n     This mash is fed to the chicks as soon as they are placed under the\r\n     brooder stove. It may be placed in hoppers. Let the chicks have all\r\n     they want to eat; some of the mash should be before them at all\r\n     times.\r\n\r\n     Teach the chicks where to find the warmth by enclosing them for a few\r\n     days with a 1/2 inch mesh wire one foot high and set from 10 to 12\r\n     inches from the edge of the hover.\r\n\r\n     Put some clean grit on bits of cardboard in several places around the\r\n     hover when the chicks are first brought from the incubator.\r\n\r\n     A little sour skim-milk or semi-solid buttermilk, diluted 1 to 7 in\r\n     founts should be available from the beginning.\r\n\r\n     After the chicks are 60 hours old or when you are sure they are\r\n     hungry, begin to feed, using cardboard in the same manner as before.\r\n     Follow the feeding chart.\r\n\r\n     Feed little and often. Keep the chicks slightly hungry.\r\n\r\n     Watch for dead chicks and remove them as soon as they are noticed.\r\n\r\n     Attend to heaters early and late; be sure at all times that they are\r\n     in good working order.\r\n\r\n     Clean out litter, particularly beneath the hover as often as it\r\n     becomes soiled.\r\n\r\n     Induce exercise and keep the youngsters occupied.\r\n\r\n     Get them out-of-doors as early as possible, even if only for a few\r\n     minutes in the warmer part of the day.\r\n\r\n     Feed green feed. Feed early and late. Keep the chicks growing.\r\n\r\n_Growing Stock Ration._--The baby chick mash can be used for feeding the\r\ngrowing birds, omitting the cod liver oil if they are on range. The baby\r\nchick grain ration can be used also during this period but it need not be\r\nso finely cracked. Plenty of grain should be available at all times.\r\n\r\n_Laying Ration._--When the birds are getting ready to lay, the ration\r\nshould be changed so that during the winter laying season the mash will\r\ninclude equal amounts of yellow corn meal, wheat bran, wheat middlings,\r\nground heavy oats and meat scrap. Twenty-five per cent of dried buttermilk\r\nor skim-milk may be substituted for an equal amount of meat scrap.\r\n\r\nThe grain ration should consist of equal amounts of cracked or whole\r\nyellow corn and wheat. This should be fed in the late afternoon, giving\r\nsufficient to satisfy the appetites of the birds between the time of going\r\nto roost and a light morning meal. It should be fully consumed by eight\r\no'clock in the morning. Adequate consumption of mash is a prime requisite\r\nin egg production. The feeding of semi-solid buttermilk at the rate of 3\r\nto 5 pounds to 100 hens daily is recommended. Ten pounds of mangel beets\r\nper 100 hens or 1 square inch of well-sprouted oats per bird will supply\r\nneeded green food during the winter.\r\n\r\nIn many cases it will be found more satisfactory to purchase ready mixed\r\nrations from a local dealer who handles reliable and scientifically\r\ncompounded feeds for poultry. This is particularly applicable where the\r\nnumber of birds is of ordinary proportions. Little, if any, economy will\r\nbe found in purchasing small quantities of each ingredient and attempting\r\nto thoroughly mix them at home. If the flock is very large there may be\r\nworth-while economy in home-mixing of the ration. The efficient poultryman\r\nwill compare the cost of branded feeds with ingredient costs to guard\r\nagainst being overcharged.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the standard rations the growing stock and laying birds\r\nshould have access at all times to grit, shell and charcoal, kept in\r\nsuitable containers. These may be obtained of the local dealer.\r\n\r\n_Sanitation._--When growing stock and laying hens are kept under modern\r\nintensive conditions the observance of the rules of sanitation is\r\nessential. Failure to observe them is likely to result in loss of\r\nproduction, serious sickness of the flock and the nullifying of all other\r\nconstructive factors.\r\n\r\nDropping boards beneath the roosts must be cleaned frequently and\r\nregularly to prevent accumulation of filth. If the dropping boards are\r\nconstructed of matched lumber with the boards running in the direction in\r\nwhich they are to be scraped it will facilitate the cleaning process.\r\n\r\nBefore the birds are placed in winter quarters the laying house should be\r\nthoroughly cleaned of all litter and debris. The interior may then be\r\nthoroughly sprayed with a disinfectant composed of some good coal tar\r\npreparation, and this repeated in the spring. The surface will need to be\r\npainted with a good disinfectant, of which there are a number of\r\ncommercial preparations on the market. A close watch should be made for\r\nvermin in the house and on the birds, and if lice or similar parasites are\r\ndiscovered, immediate action should be taken to destroy both the adults\r\nand the eggs, since these parasites will debilitate the flock and prevent\r\ntheir development and may seriously check their ability to lay.\r\n\r\n_Management of Artificial Lights._--The electric lights mentioned in the\r\nprevious chapter should be turned on about four-thirty in the morning and\r\nkept on until daylight or used for an hour in the late evening. When\r\nlights are used there should be plenty of food and water available to\r\nenable the birds to take advantage of the additional feeding period. The\r\nscratch grain should be increased by 2 pounds daily for each hundred birds\r\nwhen lights are used. Many poultrymen find it advantageous to have a low\r\nwattage light burning all night so that hungry individuals may get a meal\r\nand return to the perches at all times. Three to five kilowatt hours per\r\nmonth for each hundred birds represents the average current consumption\r\nwhere lights are used.\r\n\r\n_Practical Suggestions for Efficient Management._--A number of successful\r\npoultrymen were recently asked to state the requisites for success in the\r\npoultry industry, with particular reference to what is known as the\r\none-man poultry flock. Such a flock is of adequate size to take\r\npractically the full time of one person in its operation. As the result of\r\nthe development of standardized feeding practices, improved equipment and\r\nbetter methods of management, the maximum number of birds that can be\r\nsuccessfully managed by one person has greatly increased in recent years.\r\nLikewise, the problems of proper feeding, adequate disease control and\r\nsuccessful selling have increased as the size of the unit has grown and as\r\ngreater intensiveness is practiced.\r\n\r\nAll of the successful men questioned advised that the keeping of poultry\r\nshould be begun in a small way in order that experience can be gained\r\nwithout the risk of losing the initial investment, or that the intending\r\noperator should gain practical knowledge of the business by working on a\r\npoultry farm for a year. Valuable knowledge can also be gained by\r\nattending short courses in poultry husbandry that are being offered at\r\nmost agricultural colleges with a very moderate expenditure of funds.\r\n\r\nOne of these successful men writes as follows: \"We are working with a man\r\nnow who was let out of a position recently but who has some savings and\r\nwho desires to go into the poultry business. He has purchased six acres of\r\nground, has built a bungalow on it and has the foundations in for three\r\nlaying houses of 500 birds' capacity each. He will have ample range for a\r\ntwo-yards system for each laying house, and, in addition, will have two\r\nranges to alternate yearly for growing his young stock. His program calls\r\nfor putting out about 2,400 chicks yearly from which he should have at\r\nleast 1,000 pullets, which he will house in two of the laying houses. The\r\nfollowing year he will carry over about 500 of these birds and can fill up\r\nwith 1,000 pullets. This is to be a one-man plant with possibly some\r\nassistance in the spring.\r\n\r\n\"I feel that 1,500 birds is the minimum required from which one man can\r\nmake a living, and five acres devoted to poultry, properly laid out, is\r\nsufficient area for this purpose. If more land is available, so much the\r\nbetter. These are minimum requirements, as I see it, and with regular feed\r\ndeliveries directly to the poultry house, running water and other\r\nlabor-saving devices, there is no reason why one man cannot successfully\r\ntake care of this number of birds, particularly where a man is starting on\r\nnew ground where there have never been any chickens and therefore less\r\nchance of disease. We advise buying baby chicks rather than partly grown\r\nor mature stock. If he follows a definite economic and sanitary program\r\nright from the start, there is no reason why his plant should not carry on\r\nprofitably, indefinitely.\"\r\n\r\nThis practical man says further: \"It is our experience that the majority\r\nof the people going into the poultry business go in 'blind.' Their chicken\r\nhouses are put up irrespective of range facilities and then after two or\r\nthree years when they begin to run into trouble they find their mistakes.\r\nI would suggest that you point out to prospective poultrymen the\r\nadvisability of first, buying land and developing their own poultry plant\r\nrather than trying to make over someone else's plant; second, buying in a\r\nlocation where buying and selling facilities have been developed; third,\r\ngetting in touch with a reliable local poultryman for guidance in laying\r\nout his plant and following only one advisor. By hooking up with only one\r\npoultryman he is presented with one way of doing things which this\r\npoultryman has found successful in his own business.\"\r\n\r\nAnother successful man states that the most economical time to start the\r\nbusiness is in the spring when day-old chicks can be secured and purchased\r\nat a lower cost than is possible in the buying of laying stock at other\r\nseasons of the year. He further advises that the greatest mistake made by\r\nmany starting in the poultry business is the lack of adequate capital. Too\r\nmany invest all of their money before any income can be secured, according\r\nto this man. Should there be a set-back during the first year or two,\r\nthere is no way of continuing and the whole investment may be lost.\r\n\r\nStill another practical man states that \"Site is, in my opinion, the most\r\nimportant factor to be considered after the decision is made that a person\r\nwishes to go into the poultry business. Successful poultry keeping\r\nprobably requires more careful selection of a farm than any other\r\nagricultural industry. There should be light soil with good air and water\r\ndrainage and an area of sufficient size to permit shifting the poultry on\r\ndifferent areas as a means of preventing disease infection and as a means\r\nof securing vigor in the birds.\" He, too, points out that old poultry\r\nfarms should not be considered by prospective poultrymen unless they have\r\nbeen approved by an expert in these lines, for the reason that these farms\r\nare frequently offered for sale because of persistent disease infection\r\nwhich it is very difficult to eliminate, or because of some fundamental\r\ndifficulty, such as poor soil drainage.\r\n\r\n\"In the construction of buildings,\" continues this experienced poultryman,\r\n\"sufficient housing should be provided to prevent overcrowding and the\r\ndifficulties that come in the train of that condition. About three square\r\nfeet of floor space per bird is required for the lighter breeds such as\r\nLeghorns, and four to five square feet per bird for the heavier breeds.\r\nFor the one-man plant, the recommendation is for a maximum of about 1,500\r\nbirds. This would require from 4,500 to 5,250 square feet of floor space\r\nsuitably arranged for the lighter breeds of the Leghorn type. For the\r\nyoung stock to be used as replacements, seven to ten brooder houses, 10 by\r\n12 feet in size, would be required and about the same number of range\r\nshelters, usually 6 by 8 feet, for the purpose of sheltering growing young\r\nstock from hot sun and heavy rains when they are out on range.\"\r\n\r\n_Probable Net Income._--Many persons who have started in the poultry\r\nbusiness have been misled as to the amount of net income they will be\r\nlikely to receive from a one-man plant. It is pretty well established that\r\nin normal times a net income of from $1,500 to $2,500 annually can be\r\nsecured from a plant housing 1,500 birds. A great deal depends, of course,\r\nupon the skill of the operator, and a plant of this size requires the full\r\ntime of one competent person. It should be borne in mind that this net\r\nincome is in addition to the residence and such food as would be taken in\r\nthe form of poultry products and from the garden.\r\n\r\n_Sales Management._--Every prospective poultry keeper should determine the\r\nmarketing possibilities for the product in the area under consideration\r\nbefore he makes a choice of location. There are at least four methods of\r\nmarketing eggs and poultry meat, any one of which can be used exclusively\r\nor two or more used in combination as a means of disposing of the product\r\nto the best advantage. The system that he will adopt will depend largely\r\nupon his location, as well as upon his individual preference, and upon the\r\nfacilities that are available in the area where he operates.\r\n\r\nIn many sections of the country there are cooperative egg marketing\r\nassociations where the eggs are received in bulk from the producers, are\r\ngraded and marketed in large quantities, the producer receiving the full\r\nselling value less, of course, the costs of operating the distributing\r\nagency. In the northeastern states, egg auctions have been very\r\nsuccessfully developed. Under this system the individual producer brings\r\nhis eggs to the auction market where they are graded and sold on the basis\r\nof weight, size and other factors pertaining to quality. In this method of\r\nselling the producer receives a definite price for his eggs less a small\r\ncharge per case made by the selling agency.\r\n\r\nA successful type of direct marketing is through roadside stands. This is\r\nespecially successful in or near large centers of population where eggs\r\ncan be purchased, together with other farm commodities, at the same stand.\r\nAnother method is the operation of a retail route in which the producer\r\nsells the eggs by the door-to-door method in a near-by city. This method\r\nis followed successfully by many poultrymen who deliver eggs as regularly\r\nas the milk distributor or the baker deliver their products.\r\n\r\nStill another method is the use of mail or express as a means of\r\ntransporting the eggs to consumers in urban centers. This method, while\r\nlargely in use some years ago, has not proved so generally successful as\r\nhave some of the other methods previously given.\r\n\r\nA well-organized program of work is essential in successful poultry\r\nkeeping. The following schedule is followed by many successful poultrymen\r\nas a means of distributing their time to the best advantage during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nA POULTRYMAN'S DAILY TIME TABLE\r\n\r\n  Based on a One-man 1,500-bird Farm Producing Market Eggs\r\n  7:00-8:00 A.M.--Feed and water all stock.\r\n  8:00-9:00 A.M.--Fill mash hoppers and clean dropping boards.\r\n  9:00-11:00 A.M.--Two hours for cleaning houses, cultivating yards,\r\n                   repairing of buildings, preparation of egg cases,\r\n                   packing eggs and miscellaneous jobs.\r\n  11:00-12:00 M.--Feed green feed and collect eggs.\r\n  12:00-1:00 P.M.--Lunch hour.\r\n  1:00-2:00 P.M.--Water all stock.\r\n  2:00-4:00 P.M.--Same work as from 9:00 to 11:00 A.M.\r\n  4:00-5:00 P.M.--Feed and collect eggs.\r\n\r\n_Ducks, Geese, Turkeys and Other Fowl._--While the raising and keeping of\r\nchickens occupy the largest and most important part of the general\r\noperation of poultry keeping, there is a growing interest in the\r\nproduction of other types of fowl, including ducks, geese, turkeys, and in\r\nsome instances, guinea fowl and pheasants. Each of these really\r\nconstitutes a separate and distinct poultry industry, requiring specific\r\nfeeding, breeding and management practices. Some of the fundamental\r\nfactors in the care of these types of poultry are given for the beginner.\r\nIn the case of these fowl, as in chickens, it is essential to start in a\r\nsmall way and develop as experience dictates.\r\n\r\n_Ducks._--From a rather obscure and unknown source of poultry meat, the\r\nduck and the duckling have become common to restaurants and the home\r\ntable. This has been accomplished through the operations of large\r\ncommercial duck farms which sell hundreds of thousands of birds annually.\r\nThe selection of breed types, proper feeding and management and skillful\r\nmarketing have made it possible to attract a wide public interest and an\r\nappetite for these fowls on a permanent basis.\r\n\r\nThe best known varieties of ducks are the Indian Runner, a small type and\r\nprimarily an egg producer; the Muscovy and the Pekin, both of which are\r\nused for meat purposes, the former being best adapted to general farm use\r\nand the latter to intensive breeding on large establishments devoted\r\nsolely to the purpose of duck raising. The old simile, \"Like a duck takes\r\nto water,\" implies the fondness of ducks for the aquatic element. However,\r\nducks will do well without swimming facilities.\r\n\r\nIncubation of duck eggs can be carried on in the same manner as chicken\r\neggs, except that more moisture is essential to good hatches. The period\r\nof incubation is 28 days for all types, except for the Muscovy, for which\r\nit is 33 to 35 days. The growing birds, like mature ducks, are hardy and\r\nordinarily show a much lower mortality percentage than chickens. If only a\r\nfew ducks are kept, they will follow the habits of a flock of chickens and\r\nneed be given no special attention. When they are raised without other\r\npoultry an open shed is all that is necessary for winter quarters and\r\nsome shade arrangement for protection against hot summer sun.\r\n\r\nThe feed rations that have been given for baby chicks and growing stock\r\ncan be used for ducks, or any standard commercial feed for the respective\r\nages. It is recommended that the chick and growing mashes be mixed with\r\nfine, chopped greens such as cabbage or lawn clippings, and sufficient\r\nwater added to the mixture to make it moist. One pound of sand or grit may\r\nbe added to furnish the duck with grinding material. Fresh water in\r\nshallow dishes should be available during the feeding periods which ought\r\nto be three times a day. For the mature birds, the laying mash, previously\r\ngiven, and moistened, will be found satisfactory with fresh greens added,\r\nunless grass is available on range. Hoppers containing sand or grit should\r\nbe available if a number of ducks are kept.\r\n\r\n_Geese._--Geese can be raised successfully wherever other types of poultry\r\nwill grow. That they are not so popular as ducks is shown by the fact that\r\nonly about one-third as many geese as ducks are raised in this country.\r\nThe most popular breeds, in order of popularity, are Toulouse, Embden,\r\nAfrican and Chinese. The Toulouse is the largest and most favored, the\r\nmature gander weighing 26 pounds and the adult goose about 20 pounds.\r\n\r\nGeese are usually kept in small numbers in areas where there is an\r\nabundance of grass and a supply of water for swimming. They, like ducks,\r\nare hardy and are rarely affected with diseases or parasites. A plentiful\r\nsupply of grass is sufficient feed for the growing goslings. The demand\r\nand prices for geese are lower than for most other types of poultry. For\r\nhousing, only a shed in winter and a sun-shade in summer are required.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation varies from 30 to 35 days, depending upon the\r\nsize of the breed. The young goslings are easily killed by excessive\r\nmoisture or may become lost and therefore they require considerable\r\nattention during the early stages. A good food for the goslings is stale\r\nbread soaked in milk or water, fed after they are 48 hours old. Scalded\r\ncracked corn may also be given or a mash made of four parts corn meal and\r\none part grain middlings. Plenty of drinking water is essential. Whole\r\ngrain may be fed after the goslings are well feathered. When the geese\r\nnear the marketing period they should be kept in confinement and fed a\r\nmoist mash made of one part grain shorts and two parts corn meal. A\r\nbedding of short straw will keep the fattening pens clean and provide\r\nroughage. Best prices are obtainable during the late fall and early winter\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_Turkeys._--Because the turkey is such a popular form of meat during the\r\nholidays and so much attention is directed to it as an indigenous native\r\nbird, it rivals the American eagle as a national emblem. Turkey raising on\r\na commercial scale has had its ups and downs for a great many years. One\r\nof the principal scourges has been the so-called black-head disease and\r\nthis has destroyed the industry in many areas. It is now known that this\r\ndisease is carried by a small parasitic worm common to chickens, which,\r\nhowever, it apparently does not seriously injure. The black-head germ,\r\ncarried by this worm, clogs the blood in the head of the turkey and causes\r\nquick death. For this reason, it has been found impracticable to raise\r\nturkeys where chickens are present, unless they are kept entirely separate\r\nby confinement.\r\n\r\nThe principal varieties of domesticated turkeys are the Bronze, White\r\nHolland, Bourbon Red, Black, Narragansett and Slate. All are large,\r\nhandsome birds, each breed having a following of admirers. The Bronze is\r\nthe largest and heaviest and most popular, the mature adult male weighing\r\n36 pounds and the mature hen 20 pounds. Under ordinary conditions turkeys\r\ndo not require much in the way of housing, except in cold weather when\r\ncovered roosting sheds should be available. The period of incubation is\r\n28 days and they may be hatched under the same conditions as chickens. The\r\nday-old young birds, or poults as they are called, can be shipped in the\r\nsame manner as day-old chicks.\r\n\r\nFor feeding the poults, the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nrecommends fine-chopped hard-boiled eggs, including the shell, mixed with\r\ngreen feed for the first ten days. This may be followed by feeding the\r\nchick ration previously mentioned. Milk, especially buttermilk, is\r\nexcellent for the poults, and grit must be provided if it is not available\r\non range. Cod liver oil will be found helpful if added to the ration.\r\nTurkeys are great rangers and travelers if they have the opportunity and\r\nwill pick up enough insects to keep them going through the day. A grain\r\nration should be fed just before they go to roost. Where they are raised\r\nin confinement, or semi-confinement, more food must be given and under\r\nthese conditions the strictest sanitation must be practiced.\r\n\r\nBoth old and young turkeys should be protected from dampness, and the\r\ngrowing birds, especially, kept free from lice. The turkey grower who\r\npractices the best systems of management and feeding will be successful\r\nand will find a ready market for his product at Thanksgiving and during\r\nthe Christmas holidays. A few birds may be successfully kept in\r\nconfinement and used as a home-raised source of high quality meat during a\r\nconsiderable portion of the year.\r\n\r\n_Guinea Fowl._--The guinea is known for its watch-dog proclivities, making\r\na characteristic raucous noise when strangers appear; for the rich quality\r\nof the eggs which are produced in good quantity; and for the delectability\r\nof the breast meat when properly prepared. The young guinea may be fed as\r\nhas been recommended for young chicks. The older birds are excellent\r\nforagers and require little attention. The country home owner, if he does\r\nnot object to their noise, will find a few of these unusual birds an\r\ninteresting and valuable asset.\r\n\r\n_Pheasants._--Many persons with a flair for the new and unusual are\r\nsuccessfully raising pheasants, the Ring Neck variety being the most\r\npopular. While they are not so hardy as chickens and must be given some\r\nadded care for that reason, they may be fed in the same manner and kept\r\nsuccessfully in confinement. Pheasants may be used as an additional source\r\nof income since they are nearly always in demand for meat. The eggs may be\r\nhatched in incubators or by hens and the young pheasants brooded like\r\nchicks. The period of incubation is 21 days. Shelter is not necessary\r\nexcept in extremely cold weather and not then if trees or shrubs are\r\navailable.

The transportation of milk from the farm and its\r\ndistribution in the city constitute a costly process under present\r\nmethods, and this limits consumption. Furthermore, the ordering in advance\r\nof a definite quantity each day means as a rule that only the milk\r\ndelivered will be consumed. A maximum amount of milk is thereby set, based\r\nupon factors that may be alien to real needs of the family for this food\r\nbeverage. Using milk and dairy products freely from a near-by supply will\r\ncontribute much to the health of the entire family and especially of the\r\nchildren. The term \"family\" is used in this case to denote two or three\r\nadults and the same number of children.\r\n\r\nNutritional experts declare that milk is the most important of the\r\n\"protective\" foods. Scientists agree that milk protects by providing in\r\nthe best form those necessities which are often lacking in other foods.\r\nMilk supplies calcium so necessary for sound bones and teeth, phosphorus,\r\neasily digested protein, butter fat and milk sugar. Most important of all\r\nare the vitamins found in milk. Milk acquires these properties from the\r\ncow, a living factory manufacturing milk from raw products, which are the\r\nfoods the cow eats--the pasture grasses and the cured hay, supplemented\r\nwith carefully blended grain rations. Nutrition authorities recommend at\r\nleast a quart of milk daily for every child and ample amounts for adults\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n_Sources of Milk Supply._--The country resident will have little\r\ndifficulty in securing an adequate supply of wholesome milk at low cost.\r\nHe may obtain it from a neighbor who is in the dairy business or he may\r\nmaintain a cow or two where the area is large enough to provide some\r\npasturage and where a building for stabling is available.\r\n\r\nIf the milk is bought from some near-by farm it is important that the\r\npurchaser assure himself of the health of the cows producing the milk and\r\nof the sanitary conditions surrounding production and handling. Quality in\r\nmilk is much more than cream content. Cleanliness in production and\r\nhandling is far more important, and this the country resident can\r\npersonally determine by occasional visits to the source of supply, an\r\nadvantage difficult for the urban resident to attain. Quality in milk is\r\nnot necessarily measured by the investment in the milking barn or the\r\nshowy external features of the producing and handling plant.\r\n\r\nThe essential factors in the production of clean, wholesome milk are\r\nhealthy, clean cows; healthy milkers; clean, sterile utensils; and\r\nsanitary stables and premises. These conditions can be attained by any\r\ncareful dairyman and can be checked by any layman interested in securing a\r\ndependable supply of safe milk. The purchaser should insist that the cows\r\nbe tested regularly under government supervision for tuberculosis and the\r\nreactors to the test removed from the herd. This is important in all\r\ncircumstances and particularly so where the milk is consumed in the\r\nunprocessed state by children.\r\n\r\n_Producing Milk at Home._--It is entirely feasible for the rural family to\r\nproduce at home an ample supply of milk at low cost. To do this it is only\r\nnecessary to have stabling facilities for one or two cows and to have a\r\nmember of the family sufficiently interested to feed, care for and milk\r\nthe cow or cows. If this plan is to be followed the owner, if he is\r\ninexperienced, should enlist the aid of a neighbor or friend in making the\r\npurchase. The animal should be fresh, that is, just starting the period of\r\nlactation, and preferably not more than four or five years of age. A cow\r\nthat is fresh can be judged as to ability to produce good milk from all\r\nfour quarters of the udder in adequate amount.\r\n\r\n_Selecting the Family Cow._--The breed to be selected is not important,\r\nexcept that for family use a cow of the so-called Channel breeds (Guernsey\r\nor Jersey) is considered better adapted because of the higher butter fat\r\ncontent of the milk as compared with the Holstein-Friesian, for example,\r\nwhich usually produces a larger total quantity of milk with less butter\r\nfat. It is not necessary to purchase a pure-bred animal of any of the\r\nbreeds, so far as milk production is concerned. On the other hand, a\r\npure-bred registered cow may often be purchased at moderate cost. The\r\nowner will undoubtedly take greater pride in such an animal and her\r\noffspring will have higher selling value.\r\n\r\nIn making a purchase the new owner should insist upon having a tuberculin\r\ntest chart delivered with the animal, and certification as to freedom from\r\ncontagious abortion (B. abortus) should also be obtained if possible. If\r\nproduction records have been kept during the animal's previous lactation\r\nperiods, these should be secured, as they will definitely indicate\r\nmilk-producing ability over a considerable period of time. For family use\r\na cow that produces milk steadily in uniform amounts over eight or ten\r\nmonths is far more desirable than one which produces a large volume\r\nfollowing freshening and then slumps off rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Desirable types of utensils for a small dairy. _A._ Crock\r\nfor temporary milk storage or for gravity separation of cream. _B._\r\nMilking stool. _C._ Twenty-quart milk can and cover. _D._ Strainer. _E._\r\nStirrer. _F._ Circulating water cooler for freshly drawn milk (not\r\nessential for a one- or two-cow dairy if other cooling practices are\r\nfollowed). _G._ Sanitary covered-top milk pail. _H._ Measuring rod. _I._\r\nSmall churn for family butter making.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Importance of Pasture._--Pasturage plays so important a part in\r\neconomical milk production and in contributing to the health of the animal\r\nthat it is unwise to consider keeping one's own cow unless 3 or 4 acres of\r\npasture land per animal are available. When the cow is on pasture from May\r\nuntil November no other roughage is required, provided of course the\r\ngrasses and clovers are plentiful. Plenty of water is essential, and if\r\nthis is not made available by a stream in the pasture, it will be\r\nnecessary to furnish drinking water three times daily.\r\n\r\n_Stabling and Feeding._--From early November until May it will be\r\nnecessary to provide stabling facilities, roughage in the form of hay,\r\nensilage or beet pulp, and concentrated feed to keep the animal producing.\r\nAbout 3 tons of good timothy-and-clover hay or alfalfa will be needed per\r\nanimal during these six months. Storage room will be needed in the\r\nbuilding for the hay and for the concentrated feed. A good practice is to\r\nkeep the cow in a box stall 12 by 14 feet in size. Ample bedding should be\r\nprovided, consisting of straw, wood shavings, shredded corn stalks, peat\r\nmoss or dried leaves. These will absorb the liquid manure and after such\r\nuse should be applied to the garden or other land areas for fertilizing\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe daily ration of the cow when stabled will consist of from 15 to 25\r\npounds of hay daily and 1 pound of concentrated feed for each 3-1/2 pounds\r\nof milk being produced. (A quart of milk weighs about 2.2 pounds.) Milk\r\nflow can be stimulated and the health of the cow conserved by feeding\r\nmoistened beet pulp, where silage is not available. This may be purchased\r\nlocally at the feed store, where the grain concentrate may also be\r\nobtained. The latter can be bought in bags and a mixture analyzing about\r\n20 per cent protein is recommended. When the cow is on pasture the grain\r\nration may be reduced by one-third or one-half, depending upon the quality\r\nof the pasture available.\r\n\r\n_Cost of Milk Production._--Where all of the feed mentioned above is\r\npurchased, the cost per quart of the milk will approximate 3 cents,\r\nexcluding labor and overhead costs of buildings, etc. This cost can be\r\nreduced if pasture does not have to be rented and if some of the other\r\nfood requirements are raised at home.\r\n\r\n_Management._--Feeding the cow twice daily and milking at the same\r\ninterval will give the best results. Morning and evening are usually the\r\nmost convenient times for milking and the same hourly routine should be\r\nobserved daily. Feeding the grain ration after milking is desirable. A\r\ngood practice is to furnish hay and beet pulp between milkings.\r\n\r\nTo insure cleanliness of the milk, the udder and teats may be wiped with a\r\ndamp cloth before milking. Flanks and the udder should be clipped of hair,\r\nthus facilitating a clean condition of the animal at all times. Soiled\r\nbedding should be removed and clean material substituted as required.\r\n\r\nThe normal cow should produce an average of 10 quarts of milk daily over a\r\nperiod of ten months. In the remaining two months the cow will not be\r\nproducing milk but will be resting and building up body reserves for the\r\ncoming period of lactation. The cow should be bred about nine months\r\nbefore it is desired to have her bear a calf. The time of year when such\r\nfreshening should occur is not important, although either spring or fall\r\nmonths are considered best, to avoid weather and temperature extremes at\r\nthe critical calving period. Under this plan it will be noted that the\r\nfamily will not have milk from home sources for two months during the\r\nyear. The alternative is to have two cows, one freshening in April and the\r\nother in October, ensuring a continuous supply, or to purchase milk during\r\nthe \"dry\" period.\r\n\r\n_Utilizing a Large Supply of Milk._--The urban consumer of milk accustomed\r\nto 1 or 2 quarts daily may wonder how an average of 10 quarts or more per\r\nday can be utilized. Plenty of uses will be found for the product. Milk\r\nwill be used more often as a beverage; cream will be found delightful in\r\nmany ways, in the form of butter and home-made ice cream, for example; and\r\ncheeses will provide an outlet for surplus whole or skimmed milk. Milk of\r\ngood quality can be disposed of readily to neighbors. If two families own\r\none cow each, a plan may be worked out for furnishing each other with milk\r\nwhen one cow or the other is not producing. Wherever facilities are\r\navailable and there is a willingness to care for a family cow or two, the\r\navailability of large amounts of milk will compensate for the trouble and\r\nbring health and vigor to the rural family.\r\n\r\n_The Goat as a Source of Milk Supply._--The milk goat is especially useful\r\nto those who desire a smaller quantity of milk than that produced by a cow\r\nand where the space is inadequate for keeping a larger milk-producing\r\nanimal. In composition, goat's milk closely resembles that of the cow, the\r\nbutter fat ranging from 3.2 per cent to 4.4 per cent with total solids of\r\nnearly 12 per cent. The average production of a good milk goat is about 2\r\nquarts of milk daily, sufficient for many a family. The milk is pure\r\nwhite in color and the cream rises very slowly. If goat's milk is properly\r\nproduced and handled, the bad odor, associated with the animal in the\r\npublic mind, should not be present. Keeping dirt or hair out of the milk\r\nwhen it is being drawn, and clean quarters, are essential in eliminating\r\nodor in the milk. It has been proved that goat's milk is especially\r\nvaluable for children and invalids and exceeds cow's milk in ease of\r\ndigestibility.\r\n\r\nGoats are in their prime at about five years of age, but will continue to\r\nproduce milk for several years after that. They should be bred twice a\r\nyear. The usual number of kids is two, although occasionally four are born\r\nat one time. The period between breeding and giving birth is about five\r\nmonths. Goats may be successfully fed with the same rations as the dairy\r\ncow. Although they consume only about one-seventh as much feed as the cow,\r\nthe common impression that the goat can produce milk on practically no\r\nfeed is erroneous. A ration for winter feeding, suggested by the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture, consists of 2 pounds of alfalfa or\r\nclover hay, 1-1/2 pounds of silage or roots and from 1 to 2 pounds of a\r\nconcentrated grain ration, composed of 100 pounds of corn, 100 pounds of\r\noats, 50 pounds of bran and 25 pounds of linseed meal. In the summer when\r\npasture is available they should be fed 1 to 1-1/2 pounds of the grain\r\nmixture. Data from experiment stations indicate that the annual feed cost\r\nof a milk goat is about $11 and the feed cost per quart of milk produced,\r\nabout 1-1/2 cents.\r\n\r\nGood milk goats bring good prices and in most instances will cost almost\r\nas much as a cow. They are much more prolific, however, permitting more\r\nrapid additions and offering greater revenue from the sales of young\r\nanimals, wherever there is a market for them. The two principal breeds are\r\nthe Toggenburg and the Saanen, both originating in Switzerland, and the\r\nSpanish Maltese whose original home was in the island of Malta. Goats are\r\nthoroughly domesticated, are contented with a small grazing area and may\r\nbe easily handled. They are subject to stomach worms, indicated by loss of\r\nflesh and weakness, and to Malta fever, which can be transmitted to man,\r\nin whom it is evidenced by recurring high temperatures. The former can be\r\ncontrolled by using, as a drench, a copper sulfate solution of 1 ounce to\r\n3 quarts of water. Where the latter trouble is present the milk should be\r\npasteurized or scalded before it is consumed. As an economical source of\r\neasily digested milk, the goat is recommended, especially to those\r\nfamilies with rather small acreage. They can make the most of poorer\r\npasturage, are clean in habits and docile.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do's_\r\n\r\nUse milk freely for its food value to every member of the family.\r\n\r\nMake sure of the quality of the milk purchased.\r\n\r\nAcquiring a family cow is the best and cheapest source of an adequate milk\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nManagement of the right kind will make the family cow an invaluable asset.\r\n\r\nLearn to use surplus milk in nutritious and palatable ways.\r\n\r\nDetermine the possibilities of securing from the goat an adequate milk\r\nsupply for a small family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don'ts_\r\n\r\nDon't use canned milk except as supplement to liberal, fresh supply.\r\n\r\nDon't overlook the need of pasturage for economical milk production.\r\n\r\nDon't supply family with milk of doubtful sanitary quality.\r\n\r\nDon't neglect to have a veterinarian make health tests of the cow or\r\ngoat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ XII\r\n\r\nMARKETING FARM PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distribution of farm products on an efficient basis is one of the most\r\ndifficult problems in agriculture. Because of the demand of the consumer\r\nfor small quantities of products at each purchase, the breaking up of\r\nwholesale packages, involving additional labor and containers and the\r\nelimination of unfit specimens, increases handling costs and delays the\r\narrival of the product from the farm to the consumer. In recent years the\r\nproducer has sought various means of eliminating some of these costs of\r\ndistribution so that he could get a larger share of the consumer's dollar,\r\nand the consumer has welcomed the opportunity of buying products direct\r\nfrom the producer.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, one of the best means of selling farm commodities is\r\nthrough the medium of roadside markets that have now become so common\r\nalong the principal highways of the country. These range in type from the\r\ndisplay of a few baskets of farm commodities on the ground or on a table,\r\nwith sales of $100 a year or less, to those of a more pretentious nature\r\nin which buildings and equipment are erected suitable to the purpose. That\r\nthere are great possibilities of developing a successful business in\r\nselling products in this manner is evidenced by some of the more elaborate\r\nmarkets, transacting an annual business of $30,000 or more. In most cases\r\nthese have been developed from small beginnings and the facilities have\r\nincreased as the good reputation of the market has spread.\r\n\r\n_Advantages of Roadside Marketing._--From the standpoint of the producer\r\nor the operator of the roadside stand, there are certain advantages that\r\nhave contributed to the growth of the movement. For example, there is no\r\nexpense or time involved in delivering the products to a distant market,\r\nsince the produce is sold by a member of the household, or by the\r\noperator's employees in the larger types of markets. It is possible\r\nthrough such a market to build up a clientele of buyers who will return\r\nfor further purchases. They will tell their friends about the good\r\nquality, dependable produce which they have been able to purchase at some\r\nparticular stand. Furthermore, a wide variety of products can be sold in\r\nthis way at one stand, which might have to be segregated and shipped to\r\ndifferent markets if some other method of marketing were being followed.\r\nThis would add considerably to the expense of selling, especially where\r\nthe volume of each commodity is small. Furthermore, in such a method of\r\nselling, the producer comes in direct contact with the consumer. Ideas are\r\nexchanged, mutual confidence is developed and both should share\r\nfinancially in the advantages accruing from eliminating ordinary means of\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n_Problems in Roadside Marketing._--On the other hand, there are certain\r\ndisadvantages of roadside selling which operate against successful\r\nmerchandising in such a manner. These should be fully considered in\r\ndeciding how the surplus farm products are to be disposed of. Due to the\r\ndifficulty experienced by many potential buyers in getting satisfactory\r\nproduce, they have become discouraged and will often drive by all roadside\r\nmarkets rather than take a chance on buying commodities that may be\r\nmisrepresented. Naturally, this works against the development of adequate\r\nbusiness and makes it necessary for the individual to spend considerable\r\ntime and effort in selling himself and his market to the public and in\r\ncreating confidence and good will.\r\n\r\nThere is necessarily some loss due to depreciation in the quality of\r\nperishable commodities. In many cases it is necessary to expose these\r\ncommodities to the sun and weather, and if they are not sold promptly\r\nthey will not long maintain the standard of quality which the operator\r\nmust have identified with his market. The operator has no knowledge of the\r\nnumber of customers he will have when he displays his products, nor does\r\nhe know the whims of the individuals who may patronize his market that\r\nday. To avoid the losses resulting from unsold products it is desirable to\r\nhave some other outlet which will absorb unused quantities, even though\r\nthe price is not so good as would be secured from ordinary sales at the\r\nmarket. Many of the commodities can be delivered to some wholesale market\r\nto be sold for what they will bring. Another outlet that is available is\r\nthrough canning or preserving the commodities and selling them later in\r\nthe season under the label carried by the roadside stand.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the business of operating a roadside\r\nmarket has its own peculiar problems and success in it depends upon\r\nfollowing good merchandising principles, to which are added those finer\r\npoints which pertain to direct selling. The attitude of the public must be\r\nstudied and plans for promoting sales must be adopted which will result in\r\nattracting and holding customers. Beyond doubt, the two most important\r\nfactors in the operation of a successful roadside market are\r\nattractiveness of the stand itself and the quality of the products that\r\nare offered for sale.\r\n\r\n_Plans for a Roadside Market._--A roadside market need not be expensive to\r\nbe attractive. The thought motivating the whole project should be to\r\ncreate in the buyer's mind a farm scene, laying emphasis upon such factors\r\nas are easily associated in the public mind with farming. These include\r\nneatness of the establishment, cleanliness and honesty in every phase of\r\nthe operation. One should not undertake to run a roadside market in\r\ncompetition, so far as appearance goes, with the corner grocery store in\r\nthe city. It should have an individuality of its own and be _of_ the\r\ncountry as well as _in_ the country.\r\n\r\nThe location of the market has a great deal to do with its attractiveness.\r\nIt is well to locate it a short distance from the house, so that it stands\r\nout as a market, and it should be placed back from the highway to permit\r\nmotorists to drive off the highway in making stops for purchases. In some\r\nstates, highway regulations require that such stands be located far enough\r\nfrom the highway to permit all four wheels of a standing vehicle to be off\r\nthe road surface. If the stand can be located under some good shade trees,\r\nthat in itself constitutes an invitation to the sun-blinded traveler to\r\nstop and partake of the commodities offered for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A wayside market that meets every need and attracts\r\nbuyers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as the design of the market itself is concerned, there are endless\r\nopportunities for one's genius to be brought into operation. It should be\r\nborne in mind that, while there are certain standard requirements in the\r\nway of display shelves and facilities for keeping reserve stocks\r\nimmediately available, as well as a safe container for funds, originality\r\nin design attracts attention. Here again, the design should not be\r\nobtrusive, but one that blends with the atmosphere of the place where the\r\nstand is set up. It must convey the impression that the owner of the\r\nproperty is himself the operator of the stand and has transferred to the\r\nstand the same interest which is manifested in his home and its immediate\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nMost purchasers at roadside stands want to see the whole display without\r\nhaving to stumble over baskets and other articles to find out what is\r\noffered, and they expect prompt attention. As a general rule, the more\r\nnearly the stand can supply the complete needs of the purchaser in that\r\nfield, the more likely are buyers to stop and become regular patrons. In\r\naddition to the display of seasonable fruits and vegetables, it is\r\ndesirable to have eggs and dairy products, including butter, cottage\r\ncheese, canned fruits or jellies that have the home-made farm atmosphere\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, ice is available or electric refrigeration can be utilized\r\nfor keeping cold milk, buttermilk, cider and other products available for\r\nimmediate consumption for the hot and thirsty traveler in the summertime.\r\nHot coffee or hot chocolate can be made available for service in colder\r\nweather. Very often the road-stand operator destroys the genuine sales\r\nappeal that such stands have by specializing in manufactured concoctions\r\nthat have no relation whatever to the location where they are sold. Too\r\noften the stands are covered with advertisements of such commodities, and\r\nthis immediately creates sales resistance so far as the promotion of fresh\r\nfarm products is concerned.\r\n\r\n_Origin of Products Offered._--The ordinary purchaser at a roadside market\r\nlikes to think that he is buying products raised or processed on the place\r\nwhere they are sold, and believes that he is thereby securing fresher and\r\nbetter commodities in which the seller has had an interest from planting\r\ntime to harvest. Certainly some of the commodities sold should come\r\ndirectly from the tract where the market is located, and visual evidence\r\nshould be given of that fact. On the other hand, there is no objection to\r\nthe addition of other commodities so long as they are in accord with what\r\na producer might be expected to have for sale at that season of the year.\r\nMany operators have found that the sale of gasoline and lubricating oil\r\nand tobacco in various forms can be offered for sale to good advantage\r\nsimply as a part of the service being offered by the market to the public.\r\n\r\n_Quality the Keystone._--The fundamental basis for success in the\r\noperation of any roadside market lies in the quality of the products that\r\nare offered for sale. This is a rather difficult condition for the\r\noperator to maintain consistently, but it is fundamental in securing\r\ncustomers and in keeping them. Products that have become stale,\r\nunattractive or unpalatable for any reason should never be offered for\r\nsale and should be discarded, made into some by-product or sold through\r\nsome channel which will not identify the article with the stand itself. A\r\nsatisfied customer who develops confidence in the integrity and good faith\r\nof the stand operator is a decided asset, and no effort spent in\r\ncultivating such confidence is wasted.\r\n\r\nEvery successful roadside stand operator has built his business on honest\r\ndealing and a personal interest in seeing that the buyer is satisfied.\r\nThis contact between the owner of a small business and a buyer is one that\r\ncan be capitalized to a very great extent. It is one of the handicaps\r\nwhich a chain-store organization has to face and one that must be\r\ndeveloped by the person who wishes to establish a permanent and\r\nsatisfactory business in this merchandising field. Very often the sale of\r\nfarm products can be supplemented to the advantage of the stand by\r\noffering small ornamental plants or by the display of pet animals,\r\nparticularly for the younger members of the traveling public.\r\n\r\n_Success Factors._--A definite program of advertising can be developed\r\nwith many original features that apply directly to the type of business.\r\nIf the operator has pride in his products he will be glad to have his name\r\non every package of commodities that he sells. This is good sales\r\npropaganda even if it only indicates the confidence of the seller in his\r\nproducts and his willingness to stand behind them. Besides that, however,\r\nit creates a knowledge of his name or the designation of his farm or stand\r\namong purchasers who will then have a means of identifying it to their\r\nfriends. A small leaflet, describing the products that are offered for\r\nsale and the intention of the operator to give the customer service, can\r\nbe put in each package at very small cost with good results. It is also\r\npossible to prepare leaflets dealing with methods of cooking or of\r\npreparation of the commodities sold that will build good will on the part\r\nof customers.\r\n\r\nThe most successful operators, again, are those who do not depend upon\r\ncasual visitors for their trade but who make of the casual visitor a\r\nregular customer and one who will speak a good word to others. In other\r\nwords, genuine effort must be made to identify the location as a place to\r\nwhich buyers will wish to return as they do to any other place of business\r\nthat gives satisfactory service. In this way the operator distinguishes\r\nhimself from his fly-by-night competitors who exist during a week or two\r\nwhen surpluses of commodities are available at low prices and who have no\r\nthought beyond that of the immediate sale.\r\n\r\nWherever possible, the attention of the passing consumer should be\r\ndirected to the stand before he reaches it so that he will be prepared to\r\nstop when he comes upon it. Signs of this type on either side of the\r\nstand, but some distance each way from it, are more important than is\r\ngenerally recognized. They constitute invitation cards and should be so\r\nworded as to excite curiosity and create a feeling in the intending\r\npurchaser's mind that he will make no mistake in stopping to fill his\r\nwants at the stand. It goes without saying that both the advertising and\r\nthe stand itself must be so planned as to attract the purchaser, and every\r\neffort should be concentrated on the psychology of such an appeal,\r\navoiding any appearance of slouchiness, which would be more repellent than\r\nattractive. The purchaser forms a quick opinion of the stand from the way\r\nin which it is conducted and from the appearance of the one who is there\r\nto make sales. An attitude of cordial cooperation on the part of the\r\nattendant, who is, of course, appropriately dressed and in the right\r\nmental attitude, is a factor that must not be overlooked in the effort to\r\ncreate a favorable impression.\r\n\r\n_Meal Service Amid Farm Surroundings._--Many operators, located at\r\nstrategic points near main highways, have found that maximum profits are\r\nobtained by serving meals prepared from the vegetables supplemented by\r\npoultry or other products of the little farm. These meals may be served in\r\na booth or building adjoining the roadside stand or in a room of the house\r\nturned into a seasonal dining room. Persons who are city residents quickly\r\nlearn to appreciate the virtues of fresh vegetables and freshly killed\r\npoultry that may be thus served. A schedule of reasonable prices must be\r\nmaintained if trade is to be built up. Usually special dinners or lunches\r\ncan be prepared from available products in season, thereby giving the\r\ncustomer more for his money at the least cost and trouble to the operator.\r\n\r\nThis small home restaurant business can be handled frequently by members\r\nof the operator's household and countless examples can be given of real\r\nfinancial success following such ventures. Expansion can take place as\r\nconsumer demand develops. Cleanliness, good home cooking, generous\r\nportions and prompt and courteous service will work wonders in such a\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n_Tourist Guest Houses._--A large number of country homes are now open to\r\nthe public as tourist guest houses, their owners finding that they can\r\nobtain a modest but worth while supplement to other forms of income from\r\nthem. These tourist guest houses are largely a development of the past\r\nseveral years. Their popularity with automobile travelers appears to be\r\nincreasing, and there is genuine opportunity for the housewife on a small\r\nfarm to operate one of these establishments.\r\n\r\nIt should be kept in mind by the housewife who thinks of opening her home\r\nto tourists that the proposition has its drawbacks as well as its\r\nadvantages. Only a modest fee, often $1.00 for a room and 30 or 35 cents\r\nfor breakfast, is obtained from each tourist guest. However, a great\r\nnumber of American women have found that the work and trouble occasioned\r\nby taking in tourists are worth while and actually enjoy their contacts\r\nwith the traveling public.\r\n\r\nThe tourist guest house, obviously, should be located on a road that is\r\nwell traveled by tourists. A simple and attractive \"Tourists\r\nAccommodated\" sign and a neat and pleasing front yard are needed to\r\ninterest passers-by in the place. The porch should be neat and attractive\r\nand the interior of the house should give the appearance of restfulness,\r\nsimplicity and comfort.\r\n\r\nTourists usually inquire about prices and look over a place before\r\ndeciding to stop there; if there are women in the party, one of them\r\nusually makes the inquiry. The family should be courteous in answering\r\nquestions and showing the prospective customers about. They should not be\r\nindifferent, and yet must not seem to be too anxious for business. When\r\nthe travelers decide to stay, the family should endeavor at once to make\r\nthem feel at home. The guests will frequently ask questions about roads,\r\nlocal resorts and near-by recreational facilities, and the family will\r\nfind it useful to be informed on these matters.\r\n\r\n_Dog Breeding as a Source of Income._--Many persons who have located in\r\nthe country, and who have a liking for domestic animals, have found dog\r\nbreeding an interesting and frequently profitable enterprise. By placing a\r\nwire cage along the highway the attention of the traveling public is\r\nattracted to the puppies. Some of the more popular breeds of dogs include\r\nthe Airedale; the Boston, Fox and Irish Terriers; the Chow Chow; the\r\nCollie, and the English and Irish Setters.\r\n\r\nThe breeding of dogs is a highly specialized activity, particularly where\r\nit is carried on under intensive conditions and with little range. Dogs\r\nare subject to external and internal parasites requiring preventive and\r\ncurative measures. As in the case of all other animals, sanitation is an\r\nessential factor to success and feeding methods must be adjusted to the\r\nage and the breed.\r\n\r\nThe beginner in dog raising should consult a recognized veterinarian who\r\nspecializes in small animal practice, and observe his recommendations.\r\nSuch professional men are located in most communities and their advice\r\nwill be found most helpful.\r\n\r\nThe prices obtainable for male and female young animals vary with the\r\nlocality. There is usually an established scale of prices which may easily\r\nbe obtained and which it will pay to observe. Dog shows are growing in\r\npopularity and exhibitions at these expositions will serve to advertise\r\nthe breeder's stock. Advertising in local papers is effective in bringing\r\nto the public the availability of stock of distinctive breeds. Fashions in\r\ndog breeds change with the times and the public must be catered to along\r\nthe lines of current interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do's_\r\n\r\nUse the roadside market or near-by outlets for disposing of excess farm\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nFully utilize the possibilities of roadside stands in building a permanent\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nRoad stands, as well as the products on display, must have sales appeal.\r\n\r\nProduce at home all farm products offered for sale, if possible, and make\r\nthe growing area the background of the market.\r\n\r\nStress quality of products and the responsibility of the operator.\r\n\r\nAdvertising of the right type will multiply sales.\r\n\r\nOffer meal service with farm surroundings wherever possible.\r\n\r\nIf considerable traffic passes the premises, try out possibilities of\r\naccommodating tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don'ts_\r\n\r\nDon't try to dispose of miscellaneous surplus of farm commodities by\r\nshipment to market if a roadside market can be set up.\r\n\r\nDon't ruin standing of roadside market by selling inferior or stale\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nDon't try to run a city fruit stand with a farm background.\r\n\r\nDon't destroy country home life by over-commercialization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED REFERENCE LIST\r\n\r\n\r\nTimely and valuable publications of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, state departments of agriculture and state agricultural\r\ncolleges and experiment stations are available to country residents.\r\nCopies of them may be obtained by writing to the agencies mentioned. To\r\nsupplement them and also to supplement advice received from county\r\nagricultural agents, a number of useful books are listed below. Those\r\ninterested in them may, in many cases, obtain them from local libraries,\r\nor may find it useful to own certain of them themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Author              Title                            Year  Publisher\r\n\r\n  Agee, Alva          \"First Steps in Farming\"         1923  Harper\r\n\r\n  Arnold, Schuyler    \"Wayside Marketing\"              1929  De La Mare\r\n\r\n  Auchter, E.
