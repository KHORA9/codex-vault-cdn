RILEY, ESQ., THEIR AGENT IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK:\r\n  1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1852, by\r\n\r\n  SOLON ROBINSON,\r\n\r\n  in the Clerks Office of the District Court of the United States for\r\n  the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapidly increasing use of guano, in the United States, and the\r\ngrowing conviction upon the public mind, that it is the cheapest and\r\nbest purchasable manure in the world, together with the fact of a great\r\nwant of information among American farmers, as to the best mode of\r\napplying it to the soil, has induced the agents of the Peruvian\r\nGovernment for the sale of guano in the United States, to employ the\r\nauthor of this pamphlet to collect and publish such information.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped the favorably and well known name of the author, as an\r\nagricultural writer and traveller, together with his extended\r\nopportunities of witnessing the application and effect of guano upon the\r\nvarious soils and climates of this country, will give this work such a\r\ncharacter, as to induce every improving farmer, gardener, or\r\nhorticulturist, in America to give it a careful perusal. The author\r\nbelieves it will be found to contain all and much more than its title\r\nimports, and be of great value to every person using or dealing in\r\nguano; as the analysis, not only of the pure article is given, but that\r\nof several specimens of adulterated samples, so as to enable the farmer\r\nto avoid being cheated by base counterfeits.\r\n\r\nThe author will be much obliged to any gentleman who will furnish him\r\nfor publication in future editions of this work, or in the columns of\r\nTHE AGRICULTOR, any details of experiments in the use of\r\nPeruvian guano, which will be useful to the farmers of this country, as\r\nit is his desire, as well as the guano agents, to give them useful\r\nfacts; not only to increase the sale, but the fertility of the land, and\r\nwealth of the owners.\r\n\r\nWith assurances to my friends that I have no other interest in the\r\nincreased consumption of guano, I am most sincerely and respectfully\r\n\r\n  Your old Friend,\r\n\r\n  SOLON ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n  _New York, October 1852._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TREATISE ON GUANO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERUVIAN GUANO--ITS USES AND BENEFITS.\r\n\r\nOf all manures procurable by the American Farmer, guano from the\r\nrainless islands of Peru, is perhaps not only the most concentrated--the\r\nmost economical to the purchaser--but by its composition, as we will\r\nshow by analysis, the best adapted to all the crops cultivated in this\r\ncountry requiring manure. For wheat, especially, it is the one thing\r\nneedful. The mineral constituents of cultivated plants, as will also be\r\nshown by analysis, are chiefly lime, magnesia, potash, soda, chlorine,\r\nsulphuric and phosphoric acid; all of which will be found in Peruvian\r\nguano. Nitrogen, the most valuable constituent of stable or compost\r\nmanures, exists in great abundance in guano, in the exact condition\r\nrequired by plants to promote rapid vegetation. The concentration of all\r\nthese valuable properties in the small bulk of guano, renders it\r\nparticularly valuable to farms situated in districts unprovided with\r\nfacilities of cheap transportation. In some hilly regions, it would be\r\nutterly impossible to make any ordinary manure pay for transportation.\r\nWith guano the case is very different--one wagon will carry enough with\r\na single pair of horses to dress 12 or 16 acres; while of stable manure\r\nit would require as many or more loads to each acre to produce the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the greatest advantage in the use of this fertilizer;\r\nthe first application puts the land in such condition, that judicious\r\nafter cultivation renders it continuously fertile by its own action of\r\nproductiveness and reproductiveness of wheat, clover and wheat, by\r\nturning in the clover of one year for the wheat of the next, and by\r\nreturning the straw back to the ground where it grew, spread open the\r\nsurface to shade the plants of clover and manure its roots, which in\r\nturn manure the corn or wheat.\r\n\r\nAs a source of profit alone, we should recommend the continuous\r\napplication of Guano; knowing as we do, from our extensive means of\r\nobservation, that no outlay of capital ever made by the farmer, is so\r\nsure and certain to bring him back good returns for his money, as when\r\nhe invests it in this invaluable fertilizer for his impoverished soil.\r\nIn proof of this, we shall give the reader of this little work a number\r\nof experiments made by some of the most improving farmers in Virginia\r\nand other States.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE USE OF GUANO IN VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nIn no other part of the world, perhaps, can the beneficial effects of\r\nGuano be more plainly seen than in the tide-water region of Virginia. In\r\nthe counties of King George, Westmoreland, Richmond, Northumberland,\r\nLancaster, in the northern neck, as the peninsula between the Potomac\r\nand Rappahanock is termed; thousands of acres of land so poor and\r\nworthless a few years ago, it was barely rated as property, are now\r\nannually producing beautiful crops of wheat, corn and clover, solely by\r\nthe application of Guano. In the meantime, the discovery of such an easy\r\nmeans of improving a worn out and barren soil, has increased the money\r\nvalue of land three or four hundred per cent. This is not all.\r\nHeretofore, the only part of this district considered worth cultivation\r\nwas the bottom land bordering the rivers and creeks; the forest land\r\nyielding scanty crops for two or three years after being cleared,\r\nscarcely paying for the labor, while its value was rated at from $1 to\r\n$4 per acre, and unsaleable at that. Since the introduction of Guano, it\r\nis found these forest lands, which are of a sandy, loamy character, and\r\nmuch more pleasant than the bottom lands to till, can be cultivated with\r\nequal or greater profit than the stiff lands upon the bottoms. The\r\nwriter has seen repeatedly in the counties mentioned, luxuriant fields\r\nof wheat, corn and clover, while directly alongside of such crops, the\r\nground was almost as bare of vegetation as the sea-shore sands, too\r\npoor, as the common expression is there, to bear poverty grass. And what\r\nproduced this change? Simply a dressing of 200 lbs. of Guano to the\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. FAIRFAX'S EXPERIMENTS WITH GUANO.\r\n\r\nIn April 1850 the writer was on the farm of Dr. Fairfax of King George\r\ncounty, who was one of the first, if not quite the first person in that\r\npart of the State who ever made use of this substance as a manure; and\r\nhis wheat was then so large that a good sized dog was hidden from view\r\nin running through the field; while upon a neighboring piece of land of\r\nexactly the same quality, sowed at the same time, the ground scarcely\r\nlooked green; in fact, it was remarked at the time by way of contrast to\r\nthe one field hiding a dog, that the other would not hide a\r\nchicken--indeed, an egg might have been seen as far as though no wheat\r\nwas growing upon the ground. Both fields were just alike, both plowed\r\nand sowed alike, without manure, except 200 lbs of Peruvian guano upon\r\none, and that sure to bring fifteen or twenty bushels to the acre, while\r\nthe other would not exceed three bushels.\r\n\r\nOne of his first trials was with the African, of which he applied 400\r\nlbs. to the acre upon 27 acres, which would not produce three bushels of\r\nwheat to the acre, in its natural condition, but with this application,\r\nnotwithstanding it was 32 per cent. water, and, consequently, had lost\r\nmuch of it ammonia, he made an average of 12-3/4 bushels to the acre on\r\nthe whole field. Upon another, he increased the usual average yield from\r\n8 to 18 bushels, while, in his opinion, the permanent improvement of the\r\nland was of greater value than the increased yield of the first crop;\r\nfor now clover will grow where none would grow before; another advantage\r\narising from guano is, the wheat ripens so much earlier (15th of June)\r\nit escapes the rust, so apt to blight that which is late coming to\r\nmaturity. He now sows wheat in the fore part of September, three pecks\r\nto the acre, after having previously plowed in 200 lbs. of Peruvian\r\nguano to the acre, and after the first harrowing sows the clover seed.\r\nThe land is a yellow clay loam, uneven surface, very much worn; in fact,\r\nwithout the guano, and with all the manure that could be made upon the\r\nfarm--for no straw no manure--not worth cultivating. Dr. F. had been\r\nusing guano three years, at the date of our visit, and thought his\r\nprospect good for a thousand bushels of wheat upon the same ground,\r\nwhich, without guano would not produce one hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. NEWTON'S EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Willoughby Newton, of Westmoreland County, was one of the\r\nearliest and most successful experimenters in the use of guano in\r\nVirginia. He owns large and productive farms on the Potomac, but on\r\naccount of the forest land being more healthy for a residence, he bought\r\na tract of it for that purpose; not having any design of ever putting it\r\ninto cultivation. In fact, it was so poor he could not. The manure of\r\nthe farm, if it had not been wanted there, was several miles\r\ndistant--too far to haul; and so the land lay an uncultivated,\r\nunprofitable barren waste around his fine mansion; but it did not lay so\r\nvery long after he discovered the renovating power of guano. It is now\r\nannually covered with broad fields of wheat, from which he has realized\r\nupwards of twenty bushels to the acre; and the most luxuriant growths of\r\nclover upon which he can pasture any amount of stock he pleases, where\r\nthree years previous a goat would have found difficulty in sustaining\r\nlife. Mr. Newton's first experiment--what was then an experiment is now\r\na certainty--was made with African guano. But we will give the account\r\nof his operations in his own straight-forward, easily understood,\r\nfarmer-like language.\r\n\r\n\"In the effect of _guano_, especially the Peruvian, I have never been\r\ndisappointed. I have used it now for four years, with entire\r\nsatisfaction having each year been induced to enlarge my expenditure,\r\nuntil last year it reached eight hundred dollars, and for the crop of\r\nwheat this fall it exceeds one thousand. I have observed with\r\nastonishment its effect in numerous instance on the poor \"forest lands\"\r\nalluded to in a former part of this address. What the turnip and sheep\r\nhusbandry have done for the light lands of Great Britain, the general\r\nuse of guano promises to do for ours. Lands a few years ago deemed\r\nentirely incapable of producing wheat, now produce the most luxuriant\r\ncrops. From 15 to 20 bushels for one sowed, is the ordinary product on\r\nour poorest lands, from the application of 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano. I\r\nmay remark, it is not usual, in Eastern Virginia, to sow more than a\r\nbushel of wheat to the acre, and that I deem amply sufficient. Upon this\r\nsubject I hope a few details may not be considered tedious or\r\nuninteresting. I applied last fall $350 worth of guano, partly Peruvian\r\nand partly Patagonian, on a poor farm \"in the forest,\" which cost a few\r\nyears ago four dollars an acre, and reaped 1089 bushels of beautiful\r\nwheat from 78 sowed. Forty-six bushels were sowed on fallow, (both guano\r\nand wheat put in with the cultivator, followed by a heavy harrow,) and\r\nyielded 790 bushels or over 17-1/4 for one. A considerable part of this\r\nwas dressed with Patagonian guano, and was much inferior to the other\r\nportion. A lot on which 15 bushels was sowed, and dressed with Peruvian\r\nguano, was threshed separately, and yielded 301 bushels, or over 20 for\r\none. The whole cost of the farm was $1520, and I have good reason to\r\nexpect with a favorable season from the crop now sowed and dressed with\r\nguano, a bushel of wheat for every dollar of the prime cost of the farm.\r\nMany other instances of profit from the use of guano, equally striking\r\nhave occurred among my neighbors and friends, but I confine myself to\r\nthose stated, because having come under my immediate observation, I can\r\nvouch for their entire accuracy. It has been frequently objected to the\r\nuse of guano, that it is not permanent. It would be unreasonable to\r\nexpect great permanent improvement from a manure so active, and which\r\nyielded go large a profit on the first crop. Yet I have seen some\r\nstriking evidences of its permanency in heavy crops of clover,\r\nsucceeding wheat, and in the increase of the crop of wheat on a second\r\napplication. As an instance, I may mention that two years ago I sowed\r\nupon a single detached acre of \"forest land,\" one bushel of wheat and\r\ndressed it with a barrel of African guano, costing $4, and the yield was\r\nseventeen bushels. Last fall the same land, after remaining one year in\r\nclover, was again sowed with one bushel of wheat and dressed with 140\r\nlbs. of Peruvian guano, costing $3, and the product was 22 bushels. Yet\r\nI would advise no one to rely upon guano exclusively. Its analysis shows\r\nthat it contains salts of ammonia, alkaline phosphates and the other\r\nmineral elements necessary to produce the grain of wheat, but is\r\ndeficient in most of the elements of the straw and roots of the plants.\r\nHence, (says Liebig) 'a rational agriculturist, in using guano, cannot\r\ndispense with stable dung.' We should, therefore, be careful not to\r\nexhaust the soil of organic manures, but by retaining the straw of the\r\nwheat, and occasionally a crop of clover, which plant contains a large\r\npercentage of the alkaline carbonates, which are entirely wanting in\r\nGuano, furnish all the elements necessary to the entire wheat plant. In\r\nthis view of the subject, and for many other reasons that I cannot stop\r\nto enumerate, there cannot be, when guano is extensively used, a more\r\njudicious rotation than the Pamunky five field system, in which clover\r\noccupies a prominent place. I have now enumerated some of the most\r\nprominent means by which you may \"keep your land rich.\" I would not\r\ndiscourage the use of others. Science is daily making discoveries in the\r\nart of enriching the earth, and we should discard nothing, without a\r\ntrial, which promises to be useful; always bearing in mind that the\r\nwisest economy is entirely consistent with the most liberal expenditure,\r\nin the purchase of manures, provided we take care, by judicious\r\nexperiments and observation, to ascertain their efficacy, and that we\r\nget back our capital, with an actual _net_ profit _in cash_, on all our\r\ninvestments. This latter caution is indispensable, in our country, where\r\nnew lands are so abundant and cheap, that highly improved farms can\r\nnever be rated in the market at their true value.\"\r\n\r\n\"The various manures compounded by chemists and manufacturers, should\r\nalso engage your careful attention. They should not be recklessly thrown\r\naside as humbugs, without trial or investigation, nor adopted and\r\nextensively used with blind confidence in their efficacy. I have used\r\nmany of these manures by way of experiment, and the profit realized upon\r\nthem has not justified me in enlarging my operations. Poudrette,\r\nmanufactured in Baltimore; Bommers manure, Chappel's fertilizer and\r\nKentish & Co.'s prepared guano, (used, it is true, upon a small scale,)\r\nhave not realized the promises made in their behalf. Yet I would by no\r\nmeans discourage the praiseworthy efforts of the manufacturers, and hope\r\nthey will persevere until, by lessening the bulk and increasing the\r\npower of their compounds, they may be able to prepare an article that\r\nfor cheapness, convenience of application and efficacy, shall equal or\r\nsurpass the best Peruvian guano.\"\r\n\r\nThat desideratum, Professor Mapes believes he has already attained by\r\nthe addition of superphosphate of lime to the Guano, making a compound\r\nof two-thirds of the latter to one of the former, more valuable by\r\nweight than the pure article. That being the case will greatly increase\r\nthe consumption of Guano, and greatly improve the condition of all that\r\nclass of farmers who desire to make their poor lands rich.\r\n\r\nOf the use of lime, Mr. Newton has the following testimony, which we\r\nembody here for its great practical value.\r\n\r\n\"Calcareous matter is the great want of most of our lands, and in some\r\nform is essential to permanent improvement. It should be regarded as the\r\nbasis of all our operations, and never to be dispensed with for any\r\nsubstitute. From long experience in the use of lime, I am satisfied that\r\nthe French plan, of light and frequent dressings, is not only much more\r\neconomical, but much safer, in our climate, than the heavy dressings\r\ncommon in Great Britain. Fifty bushels of slaked lime to the acre, I\r\nhave found amply sufficient for any of our lands, and a greater quantity\r\noften attended with injury to the soil and crops, whilst twenty-five\r\nbushels will answer every purpose on thin lands, deficient in vegetable\r\nmatter. Ashes, bone dust, and the various marine manures that abound on\r\nthe shores of the Chesapeake and its tributaries, will be found\r\nimportant auxiliaries in the work of 'keeping your lands rich,' whilst\r\nthe necessity of clover and the proper grasses, to any system of\r\npermanent improvement, is too obvious to require comment.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough caustic lime should never be used in connection, or so as to\r\ncome in contact with the Guano, there is no doubt of its being a\r\nvaluable auxiliary. Upon land limed this year, Guano may be used next,\r\nand if mixed with charcoal or plaster, or plowed in and thoroughly\r\nincorporated with the soil, especially if it contains a considerable\r\nportion of clay, no loss of ammonia will occur, in consequence of the\r\naction of the lime. On the contrary, the effect will be to make the\r\naction of the Guano more active, and the immediate benefit greater;\r\nthough, of course the succeeding crops would not receive as great a\r\nshare. But, as Mr. Newton says, ought we to ask for great advantages to\r\nsucceeding crops, from a manure which gives us such great profits from\r\nthe present one.\r\n\r\nFrom our notes taken upon the spot, we give a few items more in detail\r\nof Mr. Newton's operations, than he has done in the preceding\r\nquotations. The tract of land he speaks of is gently undulating; of a\r\nsandy loam, with a greater amount of clay in the subsoil; had been\r\nliterally _worn out_ in former years by the shallow plowing, skinning\r\nsystem of farming, until it would produce no more, when it was abandoned\r\nand suffered to grow up again in forest timber, principally pine of the\r\n\"old field\" species. No land could offer less inducements to the\r\ncultivator or give smaller hope of renovation, than these old fields of\r\nVirginia. Such was the conviction of impossibility to raise a crop upon\r\nthis kind of land, that Mr. Newton's first essay was looked upon by his\r\nneighbors with a conviction that the fool and his money would soon part\r\ncompany. One sensible old servant told us he thought his master \"for\r\nsartain was done gone crazy, cause he nebber seed no nothing grow on dat\r\nland, no how could fix him.\" The negroes, wherever guano has been\r\nintroduced, have been violently opposed to using it; not alone from its\r\ndisagreeable odor and effect upon the throat and nostrils while handling\r\nit in a dry state; but because they could not be persuaded that such a\r\nsmall measure of stuff--200 lbs. measures about three bushels--could\r\npossibly produce any effect upon the crop. Their astonishment and\r\nconsequent extravagant laudation of the effect produced, has often\r\nafforded us hours of amusement while listening to their recital of\r\n\"massa's big crop,\" of perhaps ten bushels to the acre, which was at\r\nleast double that of any one ever seen upon the same field, \"fore he put\r\ndem little pinch of snuff on him.\"\r\n\r\n_The increase of wheat from guano_ may be safely calculated upon at five\r\nbushels for each hundred weight of guano used, one year with another,\r\nand up to what may be considered a fair judicious amount to be applied,\r\nwhich may be set down at an average of 200 lbs to the acre, upon all\r\nlight soils, similar to those of that part of the country we are writing\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUANO vs. MANURE--EFFECTS UPON HEAVY LAND.\r\n\r\nMr. Newton related to us an anecdote of some value upon this point. On\r\none of his Potomac farms, a portion of the land is exceedingly\r\nheavy--pewtery land, as it is termed from its tendency when wet to run\r\ntogether, presenting a glistening appearance somewhat resembling that\r\nmetal. His overseer was about as unbelieving as the negroes, and\r\ndeclared he could beat the guano by expending the same value in manure\r\nupon a given quantity of surface. To test this and also to try its\r\neffect upon the stiff land, he applied a little short of one ton of\r\nPeruvian, which cost $50 upon ten acres, and promised a premium to the\r\noverseer if he could make a greater crop by the use of all the manure,\r\nmen and teams he saw fit to apply to another ten acres lying right along\r\nside, and of the same quality of soil. Of course he spared no labor,\r\nusing both lime and manure freely, but in the spring finding the\r\nappearance of his crop unequal to that guanoed, he gave it a top\r\ndressing of fine manure and a good working with the harrow. At harvest\r\nthe guanoed portion was ready for the sickle several days earlier than\r\nthe other, and yielded 135 bushels of a quality so very superior, it was\r\nall reserved for seed for himself and neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe product of the other was 55 bushels; difference in favor of the\r\nguano, 80 bushels--8 bushels to the acre--while the value of extra\r\nmanuring, probably exceeded the cost of guano, without any material\r\nadvantage in the effect upon succeeding crops. In fact, it is probable,\r\nthat the additional growth of straw and clover would be worth more to\r\nthe next crop on the guanoed portion, than the undecomposed manure and\r\nlime would be in the other. It is needless to say both overseer and\r\nservants, were fully convinced of the virtue of guano after this\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nAccording to our notes, Mr. Newton first used guano in 1846--one ton of\r\nIchaboe at $30, on 8 acres, with 8 bushels of seed, upon land so deadly\r\npoor, that an old negro we conversed with said; \"him so done gone massa,\r\nwouldn't grow poverty grass nuff to make hen's nest for dis nigger.\" No\r\nattempt had been made for years to grow any crop, not even oats or rye,\r\nthe last effort of expiring nature to yield sustenance to man upon one\r\nof those old worn out Virginia farms. Think of the astonishment of the\r\npoor negro, who thought his master crazy to sow wheat there _without\r\nmanure_, to see 88 bushels harvested from the 8 acres.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, he used $100 worth of Patagonian upon same kind of land and\r\nreaped 330 bushels. In 1848, $200 worth of Patagonian and Chilian at $40\r\nand $30 a ton, gave 540 bushels, which sold at $1 25, mostly for seed,\r\non account of its superior quality. In each case the advantage to the\r\nland of equal value as to the crop. In 1849, he applied 10 tons Peruvian\r\nat $47, and 11 tons Patagonian at $30, upon 260 acres, from 75 to 250\r\nlbs. to the acre. When we saw this crop the next spring, the appearance\r\nin favor of the Peruvian, was fully 50 per cent. upon the same cost of\r\neach kind per acre.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 he applied 30 tons, of course, all Peruvian, with equal success\r\nto former years.\r\n\r\nMr. Newton says, the second application of guano to the same land\r\nproduces the best result--that notwithstanding the profit of the first\r\napplication in the increased crop, the profit to the land is always\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Mr. Newton, we will place on record one expression highly\r\ncreditable to him, and convincing in its palpable truth of the value put\r\nupon this fertilizer, by a gentlemen of sound judgment and candor of\r\nspeech, equal to any other within the circle of our acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"I look upon the introduction of guano and the success attending its\r\napplication to our barren lands, in the light of a special interposition\r\nof Divine Providence, to save the northern neck of Virginia from\r\nreverting entirely into its former state of wilderness and utter\r\ndesolation. Until the discovery of guano--more valuable to us than the\r\nmines of California--I looked upon the possibility of renovating our\r\nsoil, of ever bringing it up to a point capable of producing\r\nremunerating crops as utterly hopeless. Our up-lands were all worn out,\r\nand our bottom lands fast failing, and if it had not been for guano, to\r\nrevive our last hope, a few years more and the whole country must have\r\nbeen deserted by all who desired to increase their own wealth, or\r\nadvance the cause of civilization by a profitable cultivation of the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nWe are satisfied that the above opinion will be considered of more\r\nvalue--more conclusive in favor of guano, by all who are acquainted with\r\nthe character of Willoughby Newton, than all else contained in the pages\r\nof this pamphlet.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER WITNESSES IN VIRGINIA IN FAVOR OF GUANO.\r\n\r\nAs our principal object is to convince the skeptical, or induce\r\nunbelievers in its efficacy and value, to try experiments themselves by\r\nwhich they will be convinced and enriched, we offer the names of a few\r\nmore gentlemen of high standing, who have been very fortunate in the use\r\nof this essential element of successful cultivation in Virginia, as\r\nwitnesses, whose testimony ought to be, and will be, where they are\r\nknown entirely conclusive.\r\n\r\n_Col. Robert W. Carter, of Sabine Hall_, on the Rappahanock, whose land\r\nis principally of that kind of clayey loam common upon that river, once\r\nrich but badly worn by cultivation, is so well satisfied that it is\r\nprofitable to make rich lands still more rich, he buys annually 30 or 40\r\ntons of the best in market. He says he cannot afford to sow wheat\r\nwithout guano--it is foolish and unprofitable. He sows it broad cast,\r\n200 lbs. to the acre, with no other preparation than breaking the lumps;\r\nplows it in; sows wheat and harrows that; in some cases has sown clover,\r\nand in others, followed wheat after wheat with increasing productiveness\r\nevery year; clearly proving the effect of one application, to be\r\nbeneficial to the succeeding crop. Without guano, or very high manuring,\r\nwheat will deteriorate year after year, if sown upon the same soil,\r\nuntil the product would not pay for the labor of sowing and harvesting.\r\n\r\nUpon one upland field, which without manure would not pay for\r\ncultivation, he sowed one bushel of wheat and 200 lbs. Peruvian guano\r\nand made fifteen bushels. Plowed down the stubble with same application,\r\nand when we saw the crop, should have been willing to insure it at\r\ntwenty-five bushels. Col. C. has nearly 2,000 acres in cultivation,\r\nwhich within his recollection was cultivated entirely with hoes--his\r\ngrandfather would not use a plow--was as much set against that great\r\nland improver as some modern, but no more wise farmers, are against\r\nguano. Col. C. uses the best of plows; sows 200 lbs. guano to the acre\r\nand plows it in six inches deep, and sows one bushel of wheat and\r\nharrows thoroughly, but not deep enough to disturb the guano. His gain\r\nhas been eight bushels average upon 210 lbs. guano. Thinks Peruvian at\r\n$50 a ton preferable to any other at current prices. His land is mostly\r\nclayey loam and was so much exhausted by a hundred years hard usage, it\r\nwas barely able to support the servants, until the Colonel commenced his\r\nsystem of improvements by draining, deep plowing, rotation of crops,\r\nlime, plaster, clover, and guano; the latter of which he looks upon as\r\nthe salvation of lower Virginia; while his large sales of eight or ten\r\nhundred acres of corn and wheat, sufficiently attest its value upon that\r\nlocation. His actual annual profits upon the use of guano, cannot be\r\nless than two thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nDoctor Brockenborough, Doctor Gordon, Messrs. Dobyn, Micou, Garnett and\r\nothers of Tappahannock and vicinity, have all found the application even\r\nupon the bottom lands, profitable, though not to so great an extent as\r\nupon the poor old field-pine lands of Mr. Newton; but simply from the\r\nreason that his land was utterly worthless before, but after the\r\napplication of the guano, was increased in value more than its whole\r\ncost, besides the profit derived from the crop.\r\n\r\nWm. D. Nelson, a neighbor of Mr. Newton, bought a tract of land for a\r\nresidence, at $4 an acre, which in its natural condition was not worth\r\ncultivating; but with guano will pay all expenses of that and the\r\ncultivation and the cost of the land the first crop.\r\n\r\nUpon a portion of this land, a poor sandy loam, he applied 200 lbs.\r\nPeruvian guano and one bushel of wheat per acre, and made 12 bushels,\r\nwhile a strip through the field, purposely left without guano, did not\r\nproduce the seed, and remained as destitute of clover as though it never\r\nhad been sown, forming a very striking contrast to the luxuriant growth\r\nupon each side. In another trial he made 10 bushels from one sowed, with\r\n200 lbs. of Patagonian guano, of a very good quality. This is about in\r\nproportion to the current price of the two kinds, though the latter\r\ncannot be so certainly depended upon for good quality as the Peruvian.\r\nAnother trial was made with 1,100 lbs. Peruvian and 1,100 lbs.\r\nPatagonian, and 11 bushels of seed upon 11 acres which made 160 bushels\r\nof wheat of very fine quality, and large growth of straw. Upon 36 acres,\r\nsame kind of soil, well manured in the previous crop of corn, sowed 36\r\nbushels and made 162. The first had not been manured. The evidence in\r\nfavor of guano in this case, needs no comment. By an outlay of $40, a\r\nmuch more valuable crop was made from the 11 acres than from the 36; the\r\npermanent improvement to the land from guano was much greater than from\r\nthe manure. In this case the guano was plowed in about four inches deep.\r\n\r\nMr. Nelson thinks the yield of wheat will average in that neighborhood,\r\nan increase of 16 bushels for 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano.\r\n\r\nH. Chandler, Westmoreland Court House, bought a farm at a price for the\r\nwhole below the cost of the mansion house alone, because the land was so\r\nutterly and hopelessly worn out, as to be past the ability of supporting\r\nthose engaged in its tillage. When we saw it, we should have been\r\nwilling to insure the growing crop of wheat at 20 bushels, the result of\r\n210 lbs. of Peruvian guano to the acre; while the clover upon the\r\nstubble of the previous year could not be excelled in point of\r\nluxuriousness upon the richest field in the State of New York, where the\r\nland was valued at $100 an acre.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler first commenced with 250 lbs. African guano, measuring\r\n3-1/2 bushels, to the acre, upon which he sowed one bushel of wheat. The\r\nresult 17 bushels to the acre upon land which only gave 5-1/2 bushels in\r\nany previous crop. Cost of guano $5; profit, $6 50. The next year he\r\ngained an increase of 12 bushels to the acre over previous years, by the\r\nuse of 250 lbs of Patagonian guano; while the clover, Mr. Chandler\r\nthinks, worth more than the whole cost of the application. A still\r\nbetter result was produced last year from 210 lbs. of Peruvian. The soil\r\nis a yellow clayey loam, which in its unimproved condition looks about\r\nas unpromising for a crop, as the middle of a hard beaten road.\r\n\r\nMr. C. tried guano upon river bottom land, but the improvement was not\r\nso remarkable.\r\n\r\nWe were assured by Mr. C., that many persons who had long been\r\naccustomed to look upon the hopeless barrenness of this land, were wont\r\nto stop as they rode past this field of clover, and look at it with\r\nutter astonishment. Some could not be satisfied with looking, but would\r\ndrive to the house to inquire what magical power had been used to\r\nproduce such a strange metamorphosis in the appearance of the place.\r\nWhen assured it was all effected by guano, they went away--not\r\nsatisfied--but unbelieving.\r\n\r\nWhat tends much to increase the effect of this improvement, is the fact,\r\nthat directly opposite lies another tract, still in its barren\r\ncondition, lately purchased by Dr. Spence, a very enterprising\r\ngentleman, imbued with the spirit of improvement, which will soon be\r\nbrought into the same condition, notwithstanding its unforbidding\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nMr. S. B. Atwell who owns an adjoining farm, has been equally successful\r\nin the use of guano. Before using it, his wheat upon 20 acres was hardly\r\nsufficient to pay for harvesting. The first crop after using it, 400\r\nbushels. He has also increased the crop of corn from 20 to 260 barrels\r\nby lime, guano and clover. In the meantime, the land has increased in\r\nvalue in about the same ratio.\r\n\r\nIn Lancaster County, we saw a field of wheat on the farm of Dr. Leland,\r\nsown upon corn ground, one part with 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano to the\r\nacre, the other with a full dressing of hog-pen manure, by the side of\r\nwhich the ground was seen in its natural barrenness, scarcely making a\r\nshow of greenness; while the rank growth of the guanoed portion made as\r\ngreat a contrast with that manured upon the opposite side.\r\n\r\nGuanoed wheat upon the farm of Col. Downing in the same county showed as\r\ngreat a contrast with land both limed and manured; while directly\r\nalongside of this luxuriant growth, the land was as destitute of\r\nvegetation as a brick pavement.\r\n\r\nThe effect of guano upon strawberries, Col. D. found to excel anything\r\nelse ever tried.\r\n\r\nA neighbor of Col. Downing had a fine show for a wheat crop on\r\nexceedingly poor land from the application of only 90 lbs. Peruvian\r\nGuano to the acre.\r\n\r\nCapt Wm. Harding, Northumberland, C. H., assured us he made 27 bushels\r\nper acre upon only tolerably fair land, by the use of 200 lbs. Peruvian\r\nguano, plowed in and followed by clover, worth more than the guano cost.\r\n\r\nCol. Richard A. Claybrook, in the same neighborhood, made 15\r\nbushels--the land along side almost as bare as the surface of the guano\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nWe might mention a dozen others in the same place, in fact in most of\r\nthe places mentioned, whose testimony would be as strong as those we\r\nhave named.\r\n\r\nCol. Edward Tayloe of King George Co., having been very successful in\r\nthe use of guano, induced his neighbor, Wm. Roy Mason, Esq. to test its\r\npowers by the most severe experiment we have ever known it subjected to.\r\nHe selected a point of a hill, from which every particle of soil had\r\nbeen washed away, until nothing in the world would grow there. It would\r\nnot produce, said he, a peck of wheat to the acre, but with a dressing\r\nof 300 lbs. African guano, it gave me thirteen bushels, and now while\r\nthat is covered with clover, other, so called, rich parts of the field\r\nare almost bare. A field which had never produced for years, over four\r\nbushels of wheat to the acre, was dressed with 250 lbs. of guano and one\r\nbushel of plaster at a cost of $7 to the acre, which gave thirteen\r\nbushels of a quality greatly improved, and a very large growth of straw,\r\nwhich he esteems highly as a top dressing for the clover, which far\r\nexceeded upon the guanoed land that which was highly manured. The\r\nsuccess of Mr. Mason was so flattering, he immediately purchased six\r\ntons for the next experiment.\r\n\r\nIf all the faithless would pursue the course indicated in the following\r\n_experiment with guano_, by Mr. Richard Rouzee of Essex Co. Va., they\r\nwould probably be as well convinced as he, that the greatest\r\n\"humbugging\" about guano, is in neglecting to profit by its use. He\r\nsays:--\"I must confess that I have been skeptical in relation to the\r\nvarious accounts of the fertilizing properties of guano, especially in\r\nthese times of humbuggery, and therefore determined to subject it to the\r\nmost rigid test.\" In view of this, on the 3d of October last, I selected\r\ntwo acres of land by actual measurement, proverbially poor, never having\r\nyielded in a course of ten years cultivation more than three bushels per\r\nacre, and in consequence, was called by way of derision, \"Old Kentuck.\"\r\nTo the two acres 560 lbs. of guano were applied in the most injudicious\r\nmanner by strewing it on the top of the corn bed--the consequence was,\r\nwhen the wheat was ploughed in, and came up, a small girth was only seen\r\non the top and a space between each row at least one third of its width;\r\nin this condition it remained until about the middle of November, when\r\nit had so sensibly disappeared, that it attracted the attention of one\r\nof my neighbors, who remarked to me, that at least one half of it had\r\nbeen destroyed, in which opinion I concurred; in examining that which\r\nremained, we were of opinion that three-fourths of it had from three to\r\nten flies in the maggot state on each stalk; in this state of things I\r\nsurrendered all hope of any tolerable return, more especially as the\r\nrust made its appearance in it a short time before it ripened.--Now for\r\nthe result--\r\n\r\n  The 2 acres of land yielded me 32 1/4 bushels of wheat at $1 per\r\n  bushel,                                                       $32 25\r\n  Deduct for average yield of the above, 2 acres, 6 bushels\r\n  at $1 per bushel,                                       $6 00\r\n  Deduct for Cost of 560 lbs. Guano,                     $12 70\r\n                                                         -------\r\n                                                                $18 70\r\n                                                               -------\r\n                                                                $13 55\r\n  Add for additional straw,                                         50\r\n                                                               -------\r\n                              Clear profit,                     $14.05\r\n\r\nHere is a clear profit of $14 upon $12.70 invested, and acknowledged to\r\nbe applied in the most injudicious manner. It is easy to judge what\r\nwould have been the profit under different circumstances. In the\r\nvicinity of this city where straw sells for $5 per hundred little\r\nbundles, instead of a credit of 50 cents it would have been at least\r\nhalf the cost of the guano.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUANO IN NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n_Henry K. Burgwyn's first trial with guano. Its effect on grass sown\r\nwith wheat._--The name and farm of this gentleman is so widely known as\r\na successful renovator of miserably poor worn out fields, that we are\r\ndelighted to have it in our power to have his testimony to our\r\nimpregnable array of witnesses in favor of the most valuable substance\r\nfor the improvement of such land, ever given by an overruling power for\r\nthe benefit of those who ought to be exceedingly thankful for so good a\r\ngift. But hear what this writer has to say upon this interesting\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"Having about 150 acres of my wheat, this year sown upon last year's\r\ncorn ground, and the land being rather light and not too rich, I feared\r\nlest I should fail with my grass sown on _this_ wheat, because of the\r\ntwo successive cereal crops; I therefore bought guano, mixed it with its\r\nbulk of plaster, then added fine charcoal, the same, and to this mixture\r\ndouble the whole bulk of deposit of the Roanoke river, a rich alluvial\r\nearth, and sowed the whole broadcast in February and March, and harrowed\r\nit in, on the top of the wheat I sowed at the rate of 200 lbs. of guano\r\nto the acre; the value of which, no doubt, was doubled by the mixture\r\nwith the absorbents of the ammonia, which is so exceedingly volatile\r\neven when left for a few hours, is easily dissipated by the March winds.\r\nOn this land, I had sown in October previous, clover, timothy, Kentucky\r\nblue grass, and Italian ray grass. My harvest has now been over, three\r\nweeks, and I have never had a finer stand of all these, even on our rich\r\nbottoms. The ray grass matured its seed, rather sooner than the wheat\r\nwas two-thirds as tall, and where _very thickly sown_, materially\r\ninjured the product of the wheat, _I have reaped an increased product\r\nfrom my wheat, amply sufficient to repay my outlay for the guano,\r\nplaster, &c., and have my grass as my profit on the investment_; this in\r\nturn will shade and improve my land, fatten my stock, increase my crops,\r\nand cheer my eye with 'grassy slopes,' in place of 'galled hill sides;'\r\nthis is profit sufficient for the most greedy if turned to a proper\r\naccount;--be it remembered, too, this was a light and rather poor soil,\r\nbut based on a good clay subsoil.\"\r\n\r\nTo this we beg leave to add from our own knowledge of this land, which\r\nis situated on the Roanoke river 6 or 7 miles below Halifax, that it was\r\nbefore being improved by Mr. Burgwyn, about as unpromising a tract as\r\ncan be found upon all the \"cottoned to death,\" poor old fields of that\r\nsadly abused State. In the condition it was when we first saw it, while\r\nundergoing the operation of putting a four horse plow through the broom\r\nstraw and old field pines, notwithstanding our strong faith in the\r\nability of such men as the Messrs. Burgwyns to redeem such land from its\r\ncondition of utter and apparently hopeless barrenness, we must own, that\r\nif Mr. B. had made the assertion while we were riding over this very\r\ntract, that within two years he would reap a remunerating crop of wheat\r\nfrom the barren waste, and coat the ground with a carpet of luxuriant\r\ngrass, we should have told him the day of miracles had passed away. But\r\nwe had not then seen as much as we have since of the miraculous power of\r\nPeruvian guano.\r\n\r\nWe might continue to cite hundreds of similar cases but propose to pass\r\nover into Maryland, and after showing its application there has produced\r\nequally beneficial results, travel northward, calling here and there a\r\nwitness as we proceed. Among others, we may call to the stand in\r\nMaryland, will be the editor of the American Farmer, whose testimony we\r\nconsider almost invaluable, having devoted much attention to the\r\nsubject, and to whom, and his able correspondents, we desire to award\r\nfull credit, in this general manner, to save repetition, for much of the\r\ninformation we shall give the readers of several of the succeeding\r\npages. The testimony of witnesses of such high standing, cannot be too\r\nhighly estimated by those who are anxious to learn how to renovate their\r\nworn out farms, or make the rich ones richer.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS IN MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n_Effects of guano upon the crop to which it is applied._--Edward\r\nStabler, in the American Farmer, thus speaks of an experiment he made in\r\n1845, soon after the introduction of guano to any extent into this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"In a field of some 10 acres, one acre was selected near the middle, and\r\nextending through the field, so as to embrace any difference of soil,\r\nshould there be any. On this acre 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano, at a cost\r\nof about $5 was sown with the wheat. Adjoining the guano on one side,\r\nwas manure from the barn yard, at the rate of 25 cart loads to the acre;\r\nand on the opposite side (separated by an open drain the whole\r\ndistance;) ground bones were applied on the balance of the field, at a\r\ncost of $6 to the acre; the field equally limed two years preceding.\r\nThere was no material difference in the time or manner of seeding;\r\nexcept that the manure was lightly cross-ploughed in, and the guano and\r\nbones harrowed in with the wheat.\r\n\r\n\"The yield on the guanoed acre was 35 bushels; the adjoining acre with\r\nbone, as near as could be estimated by dozens, and compared with the\r\nguano, was about 27 bushels; and the manured, about 24 bushels. The\r\nseason was unusually dry; and the manured portion suffered more from\r\nthis cause than either of the others; the land being considerably more\r\nelevated, and a south exposure.\"\r\n\r\nIn our opinion Mr. S. is in error in regard to the manured land\r\nsuffering most from drouth. In our experience we have always found the\r\nbest effects from Guano, in wet seasons, or upon irrigated land. He says\r\nalso, \"This is one of the most active of all manures; and although he\r\nthinks the effect evanescent, it might aid materially in renovating worn\r\nout lands.\" Since that time a great many other Maryland farmers have,\r\nundoubtedly come to the same conclusion, for notwithstanding the price,\r\nwhich he thinks too high to justify its extensive use, has not been\r\nmaterially reduced, there is more guano sold in Baltimore than any, or\r\nperhaps all the ports in the United States; and the benefits derived\r\nfrom its use upon the worn out lands of Maryland, have been of the most\r\nsatisfactory character.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the after crop of grass upon the land above mentioned, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The field has since been mowed three times; the first crop of grass was\r\nevidently in favor of the boned part; the second, and third, were fully\r\ntwo to one over the guano, and also yielding much heavier crops of\r\nclover seed. On a part of one land, 18 bushels to the acre of the finest\r\nof the bone were used; on this, the wheat was as heavy as on the\r\nguanoed, and the grass generally lodges before harvest, as it also does\r\non much of the adjoining land with 12 bushels of bone.\"\r\n\r\nThis is all right; it should never be mixed with lime, and it should be\r\nplowed in. In his experiments, the lime in the soil had the effect to\r\ndisengage the ammonia, and not being sufficiently buried or mixed up\r\nwith the earth to prevent its escape during a very dry season, much of\r\nits value went afloat in the atmosphere. If he had given a bushel of\r\nplaster as a top dressing, there is no doubt the effect upon the grass\r\ncrop would have been entirely different. The action of guano is very\r\nvariable upon different soils, as well as upon the same kinds of soil in\r\ndifferent seasons, or from the different manner of applying it; but\r\nthere is one thing in its favor, it seldom fails to pay for itself, as\r\nMr. Newton remarks, in the first crop; and if properly applied, that is,\r\nplowed in with wheat, upon poor, sandy, \"worn out land,\" and followed by\r\nclover, and that dressed with plaster, it will pay far better in the\r\nsucceeding years than the first. This has been fully proved in a hundred\r\ncases, since Mr. Stabler tried his experiments; for two years after, in\r\nwriting upon the same subject, he says \"Harrowing in the guano with the\r\nwheat will generally produce a better crop; but its fertilizing\r\nproperties are more evanescent. I prefer plowing it in for all field\r\ncrops; and when attainable, would always use it in conjunction with\r\nground bones, for the benefit of succeeding grass crops. This is\r\npre-supposing that you determine to improve more land than the resources\r\nof the farm will accomplish, and are willing to do it by the aid of\r\nforeign manures; and being 'far removed from lime.' If the object is to\r\nrealize the most in a single crop, and to obtain the quickest return for\r\nthe outlay, use the guano alone, and harrow it in with the wheat; but\r\nthe land, according to my experience, will derive but little benefit\r\nfrom the application, unless the amount is large. By plowing it in,\r\nparticularly if mixed with one third its bulk of plaster, the effect is\r\ndecidedly more durable; nor is it then necessary that the seeding should\r\nso immediately follow its application. If, however, the object is to\r\nimprove the land at the same time; and surely it should be a primary\r\nobject with every tiller of the soil--and lime, from your location, or\r\nthe price, is unattainable, I would advise about half the amount\r\ndetermined on, to be expended for ground bones. This may be harrowed in\r\nwith the wheat.\"\r\n\r\nIt is surprising what an effect a few bushels of ground bones to the\r\nacre will produce; reference is made to a single experiment, and not an\r\nisolated one either. Some six years since, we applied ten to twelve\r\nbushels of coarsely ground bones to the acre, on about half of a twelve\r\nacre field; on two lands adjoining, was guano, at the rate of 200 pounds\r\nto the acre, (the cost of each about the same,) and extending nearly\r\nthrough the field; both were applied in the spring, on the oat crop--and\r\nwhich was decidedly better, by the eye, on the two lands with guano. In\r\nthe fall, the field was sown with wheat, manuring heavily from the barn\r\nyard, adjoining the guano, but not spread on the two lands, or on the\r\nboned portion of the field.\r\n\r\nThere was but little difference perceived in the wheat, except from the\r\nmanure, which was the best--the field having been limed for the\r\npreceding corn crop, 80 bushels to the acre. The experiment was made to\r\ntest the comparative durability of the three kinds of manure; the guano,\r\nground bones, and manure from the barn yard; and the ultimate profit to\r\nbe derived from each, in a full rotation. After the first crop of grass,\r\nand perhaps the second, which was in favor of the manured portion, the\r\nsucceeding crops of hay and clover seed, have been decidedly better on\r\nthe boned part of the field. At the present time, and also the past\r\nseason, this being the fourth year in grass, the guanoed lands present\r\nabout the same appearance, that does a small adjoining space, purposely\r\nleft without manure of any kind, lime excepted. The manured part affords\r\ngood pasture, but is quite inferior to the boned, which would give a\r\nfair crop of hay, and probably three times as much grass as the two\r\nlands with guano. It is believed that the increased crop of clover seed\r\non the boned, over the guanoed portion, paid for the former; and that\r\nthe two crops of clover since taken from the field, have paid, or nearly\r\nso, for the lime or other manures applied.\r\n\r\nThis evidence corresponds with the opinion of Professor Mapes; that is,\r\nthat the value of an application of guano is greatly enhanced by the\r\naddition of phosphate of lime, in some shape; the guano acting\r\nimmediately and producing a direct profit, while the slow action, for\r\nwhich some farmers cannot wait, keeps up the fertility for years, or\r\nuntil the owner may find time to profit by another application of guano.\r\n\r\nWe quote again a few more of the very sensible remarks of friend\r\nStabler. \"I am an advocate for the liberal use of all kinds of manure,\r\nguano included, if the price will justify it. A farmer had better buy\r\nmanure than to buy grain, if compelled to do either; for we cannot\r\nexpect much from nothing, or reasonably calculate upon improving very\r\npoor land without manure of some description, unless plaster will act\r\nwith effect; nor is this generally the case without the land possesses\r\nnaturally, some particular source of fertility, not wholly exhausted by\r\nbad or improvident tillage.\r\n\r\n\"It is probable those will be disappointed who expect to do everything\r\nwith guano--make fine crops and improve the land, while they take\r\neverything off, and dispense almost, if not entirely, with the more\r\npermanent manures, all equally within their reach. True, we may exist\r\nfor a time, only half fed and half clothed; but it is just as reasonable\r\nto expect to improve under such a regimen, as to calculate upon\r\ncontinued, not to say increased fertility of the soil, without an ample\r\nsupply, of the right kind of manure.\r\n\r\n\"With all its acknowledged advantages, it may be questioned whether there\r\nis not one drawback to the introduction of guano. It is used with less\r\nprofit in direct connexion with lime, than with most kinds of manure;\r\nand its facility of application, and quick return, has induced many to\r\ngive up the lime entirely, if not also to some extent, to neglect the\r\nresources of the farm. Others again, in improving poor land, advise the\r\nguano first, and the lime afterwards. This may do very well; but is\r\noften better in theory than in practice, for the lime is omitted\r\naltogether, and perhaps at some risk of loss, in both time and money, as\r\nregards permanent improvement. To use a figure of speech--the prudent\r\narchitect will first secure a solid foundation to build upon, and with\r\nmaterials of known durability; this accomplished, he need have no fears\r\nof the stability of the structure, and may, at pleasure add thereto,\r\neither for ornament or utility.\"\r\n\r\n\"That thin lands may be brought to a very productive state, by the\r\nliberal and repeated applications of guano, there is no doubt; but at\r\nwhat cost and how durable the improvements might be, I am not prepared\r\nto say. In two instances, from 700 to 800 lbs. were applied at one time\r\nto an acre; but in neither did the results correspond with the expense,\r\nor induce a repetition of the experiment. My own experience so far, is\r\nin favor of more limited applications, say 100 to 200 lbs. to the acre,\r\n(taking in consideration the price of both grain and guano,) and also\r\nused in connection with other manures, which is found to be the most\r\nprofitable, and probably more durable in its effect; in two experiments,\r\nwith from 50 to 150 lbs. of guano to the acre applied three years since\r\nwith barnyard manure, for wheat, the effect on the grass crop at this\r\ntime, is quite marked; applied in this way, it hastens maturity--thus,\r\nin a degree, guarding against rust--renders the grain more perfect, and\r\nis believed to be one of the most profitable modes of using guano.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more sensible than the advice of this gentleman, not to\r\nrely upon guano alone. To waste or neglect stable and home made manures,\r\nor throw away bones or other valuable fertilizers, because we could buy\r\nguano, would be as insensible as it would for a man to throw away a\r\nhandful of bank bills, because he happened to have just then a pocket\r\nfull of gold and silver coin.\r\n\r\nWe never have, nor shall we recommend guano to the exclusion of\r\neverything else; but we do recommend every farmer in America, to whom an\r\nadditional quantity of manure would be an object, to buy guano; because\r\nhe will be almost sure to derive a certain and immediate profit from the\r\ninvestment. It will make poor lands rich, and rich lands richer.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF THE DURABLE EFFECTS OF GUANO.\r\n\r\nUpon this point, we have the following testimony of Thomas P. Stabler,\r\nof Montgomery County, Md., a gentleman of the highest degree of\r\nintelligence and integrity; one of the society of Friends, who are\r\nrather noted for not being extravagant in their expressions or encomiums\r\nof an article, without good grounds therefor. We make these remarks,\r\nbecause, as every good lawyer will tell you, the character and standing\r\nof your witnesses is of more importance than their language, to make a\r\nstrong impression in your favor.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the means within reach of farmers, by which they can\r\nrenovate their worn out lands, of which Maryland has an ample share,\r\nfriend Stabler says, \"In some districts the distance from lime is so\r\ngreat, that the man with small means can scarcely be expected to use it\r\nupon a large scale--but in regions of country where bone, guano and\r\npoudrette act favorably, none need be without important aid from their\r\nuse. Under a judicious system of cultivation and correct management,\r\neither of these will make bountiful returns the first year, and the\r\nstrongest and most conclusive evidence exists of their durability as\r\nmanures. Proofs of this abound in my neighborhood. Reference to the\r\n'facts' in a single case in point may suffice for an example. In the\r\nsummer of 1845, I prepared seventeen acres and a few perches of land for\r\nwheat About five sixths of this was extremely poor--upon a portion of\r\nthe field, was put 112 ox-cart loads of manure from the barn yard and\r\nstable, on what I considered about an average quality of the land. On\r\nthe 12th of the 9th month, (September,) I sowed seven bushels of wheat\r\non this part of the ground and plowed the manure and wheat in together\r\nwith the double shovel plow--very soon after the balance was sowed with\r\n270 pounds of good African guano per acre, for which I paid $40 per ton,\r\nand plowed this in with the wheat, immediately after sowing, in the\r\nsame manner as the other. During the succeeding winter and spring, the\r\nappearance of my wheat field became the subject of much notice and\r\nremark on the part of my neighbors, as well as others from several\r\nadjoining counties who saw it, many of whom supposed that this\r\napplication of guano could not possibly produce such a crop as its then\r\npresent appearance indicated--in this, however, they were\r\ndisappointed--there were two small pieces left without manure of any\r\nkind. One of these upon the best part of the field, and the other upon a\r\npart of medium quality.\r\n\r\n\"It may be recollected that the crop of wheat that season was generally\r\nmost inferior, both in quality and quantity. Upon the parts left without\r\nmanure, it was scarcely worth cutting, and men of integrity and good\r\njudgment, were of the opinion that without the aid of the guano, I could\r\nnot have saved more than 60 or 70 bushels of wheat from the field. The\r\nproduct was 320 bushels, that weighed 64 lbs. to the bushel. The guanoed\r\nportion continued at harvest to be decidedly better than that manured\r\nfrom the barn yard and stable. This field was sown with clover in the\r\nspring of 1846, and to this time its appearance affords as strong\r\nevidence of great improvement in the land, as it did during the growth\r\nof wheat. It has now been pastured freely during two summers, and been\r\nexposed to the action of the frosts of two winters, and upon the guanoed\r\nportion I have not yet seen a single clover root thrown out of the\r\nground, while from the part manured from the barn yard, it has almost\r\nentirely disappeared. Good farmers have frequently remarked during the\r\npresent summer that the appearance of this field warrants the conclusion\r\nthat it is now capable of producing largely of any crop common to our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Thus 'worn out land' is renovated, and ample means produced for\r\nincreasing its fertility. Similar instances of improvement exist in very\r\nmany examples that can be seen in this portion of our country, resulting\r\nfrom the application of lime, bone and poudrette, as well as from\r\nguano.\"\r\n\r\n_Guano prevents clover from being thrown out by frost._--We wish to call\r\nback the attention of the reader to this reliable statement of Mr.\r\nStabler, not only for its importance to farmers, but because the same\r\nthing has been remarked by other gentlemen who have used guano. It can\r\nonly be accounted for from the fact, that guano seems to be peculiarly\r\nadapted, more than any other manure, to give the young clover a vigorous\r\nstart, so that in its early stages it acquires a growth too strong to be\r\naffected by the usual course of freezing and thawing, by which less\r\nvigorous plants are thrown out. For this reason alone, if guano had no\r\nother value, farmers in some sections of the country where the soil is\r\npeculiarly affected by this difficulty, would find their account in the\r\nuse of an article which would enable them to grow clover, for clover is\r\nmanure, and it should be a sine qua non with every farmer to avail\r\nhimself of all the means within his reach to increase the supply of\r\nmanure from the products of his farm. Let him not depend alone upon the\r\npurchase of guano, but rather upon the means which that brings within\r\nhis reach of increasing his home supply by the growth of clover, and\r\nlargely increased production of straw. Those who are interested\r\npecuniarily, which the writer is not, in the increased sale of guano in\r\nthe United States, have no fears that our recommendations to make manure\r\nat home--to use lime, plaster, bones, clover, and every other source of\r\nfertility within their reach, will decrease the sale of guano. On the\r\ncontrary, those who are most disposed to use all these sources of\r\nfertility, are the very men most disposed to use a substance which all\r\nexperience has proved superior to all others. Besides, there is, and\r\nprobably always will be, enough \"worn out lands\" which can be profitably\r\nrenovated, to use up all the guano which will ever find its way into\r\nthis country. So our earnest recommendation is, where lime is available,\r\nlet no man claiming the honorable title of farmer, fail to make the\r\napplication. Let him also gather up all the fragments--let nothing be\r\nlost--make all the manure at home he possibly can, and then he will not\r\nonly have the means, but a disposition also to buy that which a\r\nbeneficent Providence sends him from the coast of Peru; of the good\r\neffect of which we will prove by further testimony--that of the Hon.\r\nJames A. Pearce, Senator from Maryland, and a farmer of no small note in\r\nthat State. He says--\"In April 1845, I applied 350 lbs., probably of\r\nAfrican or Patagonian guano to an acre of growing wheat, the land being\r\nentirely unimproved and very poor. It was applied as a top dressing, of\r\ncourse, but mixed with plaster.\" (In what proportion he does not say,\r\nbut we will by and bye; but he does say)--\"_The wheat was doubled in\r\nquantity at least_--fine clover succeeded it--and in two crops, one of\r\ncorn and one of small grain, three and four years afterwards, the\r\neffects are still apparent.\" Now this effect was produced by the use of\r\nthe guano as a top dressing; a method universally acknowledged to be the\r\nmost unfavorable to the development of the full value of the\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Farmer in answer to an inquiry whether a combination\r\nof charcoal, plaster, and guano would make a profitable _top dressing_\r\nin spring for wheat, says, \"yes\"--but thinks if it had been plowed in\r\nwith the seed in the fall, the result would have been much better.\r\nHowever, says he, \"we entertain not the slightest doubt, that, if his\r\nwheat field be top dressed with the mixture next spring, it will greatly\r\nincrease the yield of his wheat crop, unless the season should prove a\r\nvery dry one, as the charcoal, and plaster, will each tend to prevent\r\nthe escape of the ammoniacal gases of the guano, and as it were, offer\r\nthem up as food to the wheat plants.\r\n\r\n\"In April 1845, I applied 350 lbs. of guano to an acre of growing wheat,\r\nthe land being entirely unimproved and very poor. Of course it was\r\napplied as a top-dressing, _mixed, however, with plaster_. The wheat was\r\ndoubled in quantity at least; fine clover succeeded it; and in two\r\ncrops, one of corn, and the other of small grain, last year and the\r\npresent, the effects are still apparent.\"\r\n\r\nIf our correspondent would _mix_, in the proportion of 200 lbs. of\r\n_guano_, one bushel of _charcoal_, and half a bushel of plaster per\r\nacre, and sow the mixture on his wheat field next spring, after the\r\nfrost is entirely out of the ground, then seed each acre with clover\r\nseed, and roll his land, we have no doubt that his wheat crop would be\r\nincreased five or six bushels to the acre, perhaps more, and that he\r\nwould have a good stand of clover plants, and a luxuriant crop of the\r\nlatter next year.\r\n\r\n\"Our opinion is, that _guanoed_ land should always be sowed to clover, or\r\nclover and orchard grass.\"\r\n\r\nIn this, particularly the opinion of the last paragraph, we fully\r\nconcur--to obtain the full value of guano it must either be mixed with\r\nplaster or charcoal, or what is better, plowed in and thoroughly\r\nincorporated with the soil, and the land always sown with clover, peas\r\nor some other plant of equal value for green manure. It is true Col.\r\nCarter has been successful with wheat after wheat; while many continue\r\nsuccessful, by carefully retaining all the straw; the guano being\r\nsufficient to keep up the everlasting ability of the soil to produce an\r\nannual crop of grain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIVE FIELD SYSTEM AND GUANO.\r\n\r\nWe look upon this as the most preferable of all other systems of farming\r\never adopted in the South--it is the system of Edmund Ruffin, to whom\r\nVirginia owes a debt of gratitude beyond her power to pay. It will be\r\nseen from the following extract from a letter of Mr. Newton that that\r\neminent agriculturist is of opinion that improvement of poor land is\r\nunlimited, if guano in connection with this system is perseveringly\r\napplied. He says--\"The \"five field System,\" which is now rapidly extending\r\nover all the poor and worn lands that are now under improvement by marl,\r\nlime, or guano, originated, or at least was first extensively\r\nintroduced in lower Virginia, on the Pamunkey, and has there wrought\r\nwonders, aided by marl and judicious farming. The rotation is\r\ncorn,--wheat,--clover--wheat, or clover fallow,--and pasture, and after\r\npasture one year, commencing the round again with corn. This system, if\r\nguano be applied to both crops of wheat, on corn land and fallow, or\r\nalternately with lime or marl, when calcareous manures are required,\r\nwill readily increase the crops and permanent improvement of the land.\r\nIn the commencement of the rotation, lime had better be applied with the\r\nputrescent manures to the corn crop, to be followed by guano on wheat.\r\nIf this system be perseveringly, pursued, I can scarcely see any\r\nreasonable limits to the improvement of poor lands and the increase of\r\nthe profits of agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nDisappointment will result from the application of lime, marl, salt\r\npotash, guano, or any special and highly concentrated substance as a\r\nfertilizer, to the neglect of organic manures. We lay down this fact as\r\nincontrovertible, that no soil, however fertile it may be made for the\r\ntime being by any of these special manures, can remain permanently so,\r\nunless care is used to maintain a healthful supply of organic\r\nmatter,--rich mould--good soil upon the land cultivated. If this is\r\ndone, we never shall hear of guano failing to bring increased crops or\r\nof the \"land running out,\" where it has been applied. Special manures of\r\nany kind may fail to produce crops, where this essential requisite to\r\ngood farming is neglected. Guano, in our opinion, should always be\r\nfollowed by crops of clover, grass, peas, or some crop that will shade\r\nthe earth, and can be turned under with the plow, to keep up the\r\nnecessary supply of nitrogenous food for cereal crops.\r\n\r\n_The effect of Lime and Salt_ upon land is to _dissolve_ the inert\r\nportions of organic matters in the soil, so that plants can suck up\r\ntheir substance into their own composition. Both are highly beneficial,\r\nbut insufficient to add permanent fertility.\r\n\r\n_The effect of guano_, is greater than any other highly concentrated\r\nmanure ever discovered and applied to any soil. Its benefits are\r\nimmediate continuous, and unlike lime, without exhausting the soil of\r\nits organic matter. Yet its benefits will be increased by the addition\r\nof organic manures derived from green crops, straw, or the stable, and\r\nthe value of these will be greatly increased by the addition of lime,\r\nsalt and plaster, while any deficiency of phosphates must be supplied by\r\npowdered bones or another application of guano.\r\n\r\n_The effect of plaster with guano_ is to arrest the excursive\r\ndisposition of the volatile parts of the guano, and imprison them in the\r\nearth until called forth by the growing plants to do the State some\r\nservice. The following question to the Editor of the American Farmer,\r\nand his reply, are to the point in this matter:--\r\n\r\nA correspondent says--\"As to the question of mixing plaster with guano,\r\nthere is one question I should like to propose to the editor,\r\nviz.--'what will be the effect of sowing guano upon land by itself, and\r\nthen, the seed being in the ground, giving it a heavy top-dressing of\r\nplaster, so as to arrest the 'excursion,' of which so much is said?\"\r\n\r\n_Reply by the editor._--\"The effect of such application of guano and\r\nplaster would be, to prevent the waste of the ammonia of the former, as\r\nevery rain would decompose more or less of the plaster, separate the\r\nsulphuric acid from the lime, and the sulphuric acid when liberated,\r\nwould unite with the ammonia, form a sulphate of ammonia, and hold the\r\nlatter in reserve to be taken up by the roots of the plants. The\r\npresence of plaster with all _organic_ manures, either directly mixed\r\nwith them, or broadcasted after they may be applied, tends to prevent\r\nthe escape of their volatile parts. We prefer them together for two\r\nreasons,--_first_, because, by bringing the two into _immediate\r\ncontact_, the action of the plaster is more direct; and _secondly_,\r\nbecause the time and expense of one sowing is thereby saved. We go for\r\nsaving every way, as time and labor costs money, and we look upon\r\neconomy as a virtue, which should be practised by all, and especially by\r\nhusbandmen.\"\r\n\r\nIf the plaster and guano is mixed together, 25 lbs. of the former to 100\r\nlbs. of the latter, will be found a proper proportion, and sufficient to\r\nprevent the ammonia from making an \"excursion.\" Unless the soil be very\r\npoor, 200 lbs. of good Peruvian guano is as much as we should recommend\r\nfor wheat. In this we have the concurrence of the editor of the Farmer,\r\nand perhaps a hundred gentlemen whom we have conversed with upon this\r\nsubject. All agree in the opinion, whether mixed with plaster or not,\r\nthat a judicious application of guano will more certainly restore\r\nproductiveness to worn out land, or add fertility to that already\r\nproductive, than any other substance ever applied.\r\n\r\n_Want of Faith in the efficacy of guano._--Whatever doubts may have\r\nexisted in the minds of careful men, there is no room for doubts now,\r\nthat Peruvian guano possesses regenerating properties beyond belief,\r\nwithout evidence, and capacity to increase the productiveness of lands\r\nin sound condition, in such an eminent degree, that any farmer who has\r\nthe power to obtain it, evinces great folly and perverse obstinacy, if\r\nhe continue to cultivate his land without applying it; either for want\r\nof faith, or pretended disbelief in its efficacy; or because he thinks\r\nthe price fixed upon it by the Peruvian Government, \"unjustifiably\r\nhigh;\" or because although he has no doubt it will answer in the moist\r\nclimate of England, is sure it will never answer in this dry climate; or\r\nbecause he is afraid the luxuriant crops produced by the application of\r\nguano will exhaust his land; or because his neighbor Jones killed all\r\nhis seed corn by putting only a handful in the hill; while Mrs. Jones\r\nkilled all her flowers and fifty kinds of roses with the \"pisen stuff;\"\r\nand therefore he don't want any more to do with it; or because it has\r\nfailed to give remuneration under the most injudicious application, made\r\ncontrary to all instructions or experience of those who have used it; or\r\nfor any and all the other thousand and one objections raised by those\r\nwho have never used it, and seem determined they never will; probably\r\nbecause when the almost miraculous accounts of its operations were first\r\npublished, they had cried out \"humbug\" so loudly they are determined no\r\nafter evidence shall convince them the only humbug in the case was in\r\ntheir own disbelief. It is for the benefit of these unbelievers we are\r\nnow writing. Our object is to present such an array of facts guaranteed\r\nby such respectable names, they shall have no hook to hang a doubt\r\nupon--no reason--no justifiable excuse for any sane man longer to\r\nneglect to apply an article of such positive, certain benefit to his\r\nhungry soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nED. REYNOLDS ESQ., OF BALTIMORE, ON THE VALUE OF GUANO.\r\n\r\nWriting on the subject of \"bought manures,\" as everything is termed not\r\nproduced upon the farm, and how dubiously they are looked upon by some\r\npersons calling themselves good farmers, for fear of being humbugged,\r\nMr. Reynolds says, in a letter dated July, 1850, \"Since 1843, I have\r\nbeen trying to find out which is the best of all these 'new things,' and\r\nhave now, after having been very considerably humbugged, settled down\r\nupon bones and guano--although, even the last named in a very dry year,\r\nhas also 'cheated me'; but this is by no means its character, as I am\r\nconstrained to admit, that after having tried it on all sorts of soil,\r\nand perhaps as long if not longer than any other person in the State, it\r\nis my opinion that when properly applied, with an average fair season,\r\nit is a very powerful fertilizer. My mode of using it is, when applied\r\nto tobacco, to mix one and a half bushels of the Peruvian, (which is\r\nordinarily 100 lbs.) with one bushel rich earth, and one bushel of\r\nplaster, which admits about the fifth part of a gill of the mixture to\r\neach hill for every 5,000 hills--and putting it in the center of the\r\ncheck before being scraped--so that when the hill is made, it lies\r\nbeneath the plant. On wheat, I apply three bushels of Peruvian guano\r\nequal to 200 lbs. mixed with one bushel of plaster, one bushel rich\r\nearth to the acre, sowing on the surface and plowing it in as soon and\r\nas deep as possible, after it is sowed. The past spring I have put 300\r\nlbs. to the acre, on 30 acres of corn, being half of a field, on a farm\r\nin Calvert, mixing with it the same quantity of rich earth and plaster,\r\nand sowing on the surface, plowing in at once very deep, using the\r\ncultivator only in working it afterwards. I do not intend to use it at\r\nall with corn, hereafter, but not because I do not think it also a good\r\nfertilizer with this crop, (as my corn on my Calvert farm, upon which it\r\nhas been used, now shows very fair,) but only because it has never\r\nfailed to pay me three fold better on wheat, than on anything else. In\r\norder to test its virtue, it is essentially necessary to plow it in\r\ndeeply, and stir it as little as possible afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n_Bones._--Of these I have used both ground and crushed, and always to\r\nadvantage at ten to twelve bushels per acre; bought from manufacturers\r\nhere, and agents of houses in New York; but I am using the crushed\r\ndissolved by oil of vitriol, as prepared by myself on my farm in Calvert\r\nin the following way: The bones, (which we buy in the neighborhood at 50\r\ncents per 112 lbs.) after breaking them with a small sledge hammer on an\r\nold anvil, we put at the rate of three bushels in half a hogshead, and\r\napply to that quantity 75 lbs. oil of vitriol, filling up the half\r\nhogshead to within eight inches of the top with water, letting them\r\nremain, (but stir the contents occasionally with a stick,) say two to\r\nfive weeks, according to the quality and strength of the vitriol; then\r\nstart the contents of the half hogshead into a large iron kettle, apply\r\na slight fire and the whole contents will in less than an hour be\r\nreduced to a perfect jelly. We use two half hogsheads at once, to\r\nprepare it expeditiously. We then mix the contents of each kettle, with\r\na horse cart load of rich earth, or ashes, throwing in a half barrel of\r\nplaster, mix or compost it handsomely, and use at pleasure, on an acre\r\nof land with any crop you choose, and you will have permanently improved\r\ntwo acres at the following cost, viz: Bones, $1.50, vitriol, $3.75,\r\nplaster, $1.12, making $6.37, or $3.18 per acre, and this may be\r\nrepeated so as with proper attention, as much lasting improvement may be\r\nmade each year as many farmers derive from their barn yards. Bones in\r\nany form never fails to show their striking effects on clover and other\r\ngrasses--but either bones or guano will scarcely ever fail to produce a\r\nbetter crop of clover, which, with the increased quantity of straw,\r\n(particularly when guano is used,) will enable and encourage the saving\r\nof larger quantities of barn yard manure, and which must inevitably\r\ncause a lasting improvement.\r\n\r\nThis coincides with our views exactly, as we have in all these pages\r\nendeavored to impress upon our readers, that the increased growth of\r\nstraw from the use of guano, will increase the manure pile, and\r\n\"inevitably cause a lasting improvement.\"\r\n\r\n_Poudrette._--\"I have used also, to good advantage, particularly on\r\nclayey lands, at the rate of six to eight barrels per acre. It is a\r\nfirst rate top dressing on young clover in spring, at two to three\r\nbarrels per acre; this article has been prepared so badly heretofore,\r\nthat a great quantity of it was really worthless.\"\r\n\r\nWe also concede to poudrette as much credit as Mr. Reynolds but as will\r\nbe seen, it will cost more to improve land with it than with guano.\r\n\r\n_Prepared Guano--Agricultural Salts--Generators and Regenerators._--Of\r\nthese, the testimony of Mr. Reynolds is exactly to the point, concise\r\nand strong, and exactly in accordance with all the facts we have been\r\nable to collect upon the same subject. He says, \"I have tried them on\r\ncorn, wheat, oats, clover and tobacco; but have yet to discover that\r\nthey ever generated anything for me, though I have heard them sometimes\r\nwell spoken of.\"\r\n\r\nWant of room in this pamphlet alone prevents us from inserting the names\r\nand operations of many other gentlemen in this rapidly improving\r\nState--a State now undergoing the process of renovation by the use of\r\nguano, to a greater extent, perhaps, than any other in the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUANO IN DELAWARE.\r\n\r\n_Hon. John M. Clayton's Farm._--No one who looks upon this highly\r\nimproved farm now, with its most luxuriant crops, can be made to believe\r\nit was a barren waste seven years ago--hardly worth fencing or\r\ncultivating. This great change, so far beyond the power of human belief,\r\nhas been effected by lime, plaster and guano. The railroad from\r\nFrenchtown to New Castle, passes through this farm, four miles from the\r\nlatter place. It is well worthy a visit from any one anxious to make\r\npersonal observations of the effects of \"bought manures,\" upon a soil\r\ntoo poor to support a goose per acre.\r\n\r\n_Effect of Guano on Oats._--During a visit to Mr. Clayton, in 1851, we\r\nsaw the most luxuriant growth of oats upon one of the fields of this\r\nfarm, which we have ever witnessed, and it has been our fortune to see\r\nsome tall specimens of this crop on the bottom lands of Ohio, Indiana,\r\nand Illinois. The seed he had obtained from England, and the means of\r\nmaking it grow, from Peru. The guano was plowed in with the oats, at the\r\nrate of 350 lbs. to the acre. The soil is a yellow clayey loam. The\r\neffect upon other crops had been equally beneficial. The growth of\r\nclover was so great he had purchased thirty bullocks to fatten, for the\r\npurpose of trying to consume some of his surplus feed. The effect upon\r\nwheat, corn, potatoes, turnips, garden vegetables and fruit trees, was\r\nalmost as astonishing as upon the oats and grass.\r\n\r\n_C. P. Holcomb_, Esq., one of the most improving farmers of one of the\r\nmost improving counties in the U.S., has met with great success in the\r\nuse of lime, plaster, and guano. His beautiful highly improved home farm\r\nis near Newcastle; but that upon which he has met with great success in\r\nthe use of guano, lies about four miles from Dover. Before he purchased\r\nit had become celebrated for its miserable poverty. It is now equally\r\ncelebrated for its productiveness. The use of guano in that part of the\r\nState has now reached a point far beyond what the most sanguine would\r\nhave dared to predict four years ago; and the benefits are of the most\r\nflattering kind. Lands have been increased in value to a far greater\r\nextent than all the money paid for guano; while the increased profit\r\nfrom the annual crops, has produced corresponding improvements in the\r\ncondition and happiness of the people.\r\n\r\nNo greater blessing, said an intelligent gentleman to me, ever was\r\nbestowed upon the people of Delaware.\r\n\r\n_Extensive use of Guano by a Delaware farmer._ Maj. Jones, whose name is\r\nextensively known as a very enterprising farmer, purchased in the summer\r\nof 1851, of Messrs. A.B. Allen & Co. New York, sixty tons of Peruvian\r\nguano, for his own use. With this he dressed 300 acres of wheat, upon\r\nthe farm at his residence on the Bohemia manor; plowing in part of it\r\nand putting in part of it by a drilling machine at the rate of 200 lbs.\r\nto the acre, sowing the wheat all in drills. Part of the ground was\r\nclover, part corn, and perhaps one half wheat and oat stubble. The earth\r\nat the time of sowing was so dry, doubts were entertained whether it\r\nwould ever vegetate; and that and other causes extended the work so\r\nlate, upon a portion of the ground, there was scarcely any appearance of\r\ngreenness when it froze up. With all these disadvantages, the crop was\r\nestimated at harvest at twenty bushels to the acre. Without guano no one\r\nacquainted with the farm would have estimated the crop at an average of\r\nten bushels. This gives an undoubted increase of five bushels for each\r\nhundred weight of guano; and as the soil contains a good deal of clay\r\nwith which the guano was well mixed, it will retain much of the value of\r\nthe application, for the next crop. Maj. Jones has heretofore derived\r\nvery great benefits from the use of guano, as might safely be adjudged\r\nfrom the fact of his risking $3,000 in one purchase of the same article.\r\n\r\n_Lasting effects of Guano._--Maj. Jones is well satisfied upon this\r\npoint. In 1847, he used 16 tons, half Peruvian and half Patagonian,\r\nsowed with a lime-spreading machine and plowed in deep, say eight inches\r\non clayey loam--planted corn and made 60 bushels per acre on 100 acres;\r\nwhich was an increase of 12 bushels per acre over any former year. Next\r\nspring the weeds grew as high as his head on horseback. Rolled them down\r\nand plowed under and sowed wheat, five pecks to the acre, and made a\r\nheavier crop than ever before made on same land, which he attributes\r\nentirely to the guano. Thinks the third crop of wheat is benefitted from\r\nguano plowed in three years previous.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which guano is used in the State of Delaware may be\r\ninferred from the fact that it is not at all unusual for merchants in\r\nsmall country villages to purchase from 50 to 200 tons at a time for\r\ntheir retail trade.\r\n\r\nAmong other successful users of guano in that State, we may mention\r\nGovernor Ross, who, if as good a ruler as he is farmer, ought to be\r\ncontinued in office to the end of life.\r\n\r\nThe soil to which guano has been mostly applied in this State is a sandy\r\nloam, and the process of applying it, by sowing broadcast from 200 to\r\n350 lbs. per acre, and plowing in from four to six inches deep, previous\r\nto sowing wheat, which is always followed by clover, by every one who\r\nunderstands his own true interest; for wherever that course has been\r\npursued, there has been a certain profit derived from the application,\r\neven when the wheat has failed.\r\n\r\nThe improvements in farming in Delaware within the last ten years, will\r\nprobably exceed in proportion to acres and people, any other State in\r\nthe Union. Nearly all the northern part of the State has been whitened\r\nwith lime, and the southern part is rapidly following the same path;\r\nwhile the sale of guano in all parts will exceed any other section of\r\nthe country, if not in quantity, certainly in numbers of persons making\r\nuse of this sure means of restoring the lands of an almost ruined State,\r\nto their pristine fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUANO IN PENSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\nThere has probably been less guano used in this great State, than in her\r\nlittle sister, of which we have just been speaking. This may be owing to\r\nthe fact that great improvements have been made by the use of lime, and\r\nthat Pensylvania farmers generally are not much inclined to leave the\r\npath their fathers trod before them; or that they are skeptical as to\r\nwhat they hear of the miraculous powers of guano; hence, its use has\r\nbeen in a great measure confined to market gardeners, or experiments in\r\na small way; the sales at Philadelphia, for home consumption, so far as\r\nwe have noticed, are mostly in small lots of one to ten bags. Among all\r\nwith whom we have conversed, however, who have used Peruvian guano in\r\nthat State, we have never heard a doubt expressed of its value, though\r\nthe idea, strangely enough seems to prevail, that it will only be\r\nprofitable for gardners and small farmers, and that it is of no benefit\r\nto succeeding crops. No doubt the progress of improvement by the use of\r\nguano in that vicinity has been greatly retarded, in consequence of the\r\nsale of considerable quantities of \"cheap guano,\" which however low in\r\nthe scale of prices, is still lower in the scale of values. In fact,\r\nthere is but one thing connected with the spurious stuff, lower in any\r\nscale, and that is the honesty of those who manufacture or knowingly\r\nsell such a villainous compound to farmers, who are utterly ignorant\r\nupon the subject, under solemn assurances, that it \"is equal to any\r\nguano in market, and only a little more than half price.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Landreth, the celebrated seedsman of Philadelphia, applied $500\r\nworth of Peruvian guano last spring, principally on the bean crop--he\r\nthinks guano admirably adapted to all the Brassica tribe, including\r\nturnips, cabbages, rutubaga, radishes and all cruciform plants. Upon a\r\nlawn which appeared to be running out, he applied guano, and the grass\r\nis now green and vigorous. The character of his soil may be judged from\r\nits location; it is on the Delaware river above Bristol, and had been\r\nawfully skinned before he came in possession. Now, with a liberal\r\nexpenditure for manures, he gets two crops a year.\r\n\r\n_Guano for grass lands._--The Germantown Telegraph says: \"The\r\napplication of guano broadcast to grass lands has been found to produce\r\na decided difference in the crop. In several instances this season,\r\nwhere Peruvian guano has been applied at the rate of 200 lbs. per acre,\r\nabout the middle of April, the yield of hay has been double in quantity,\r\nover the intermediate lands not so treated; and in every instance\r\nnoticed, it is believed that the difference in quantity produced will\r\namply repay the cost of the guano.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGUANO IN NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\nGuano has not been extensively used in New Jersey, owing to the\r\nabundance of green sand marl, which is a very valuable fertilizer,\r\nabounding in that part of the State most in need of artificial manures.\r\nGuano has, wherever used, produced the most astonishing results. One of\r\nthese we witnessed upon the farm of Mr. Edward Harris, a gentleman well\r\nknown for his enterprising spirit of improvement and intelligence in\r\nagriculture, who resides at Moorestown, which lies in the sandy region\r\neast of Philadelphia. He sowed 400 lbs. to the acre, plowed in with\r\ndouble plow, sowed oats and seeded with timothy, which upon similar soil\r\noften \"burns out\" for want of shade, after the oats are harvested. Not\r\nso in this case. The shattered oats from a remarkably fine crop,\r\nvegetated and grew with such a dark green luxuriance, there was more\r\ndanger of the young grass being smothered out; so he had to put the\r\nmowers at work, who cut heavy swaths of this second crop of oats, for\r\nhay. If it had been situated so it could have been fed off, the amount\r\nof pasture would have been almost incalculable. It is needless to say\r\nthe effect of guano upon this land, was not evanescent. Other trials\r\nmade by Mr. Harris, have convinced him of its value to Jersey farmers,\r\nand that good as \"Squankum marl\" undoubtedly is, farmers would do better\r\nto expend part, at least, of their money in guano.\r\n\r\nThe name of James Buckalew is known, perhaps, more extensively than any\r\nother in New Jersey, as one of her most enterprising, rapidly improving,\r\nmoney making farmers, whose testimony in favor of guano may be easily\r\nobtained by any one who will take the trouble to go and see what\r\nbeautiful farms he has made out of the barren sands near the Jamestown\r\nstation, on the Camden & Amboy railroad, by the use of lime, plaster,\r\nmarl, manure and guano. It is a pity that every one who doubts the\r\nfeasibility of profitably improving the worst land in that State, by the\r\npower of such an agent as Peruvian guano, could not see what has been\r\ndone by Mr. Buckalew. Let them also look at what were once bare sand\r\nhills around the residence of Commodore Stevens, at South Amboy, a\r\ngentleman who ought to be more renowned for his improvements on land\r\nthan water, notwithstanding his world wide reputation, in connection\r\nwith the yacht America. Go ask how it is that these drifted sand hills\r\nhave been covered with rank grass, clover, corn, turnips and other\r\nluxuriant crops; the very echo of the question will be, guano.\r\n\r\nLook at the astonishing crops of Professor Mapes, at Newark. Peruvian\r\nguano, in combination with his improved superphosphate of lime, hath\r\nwrought the miracle, aided as it has been, by the deepest plowing ever\r\ndone in that State.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Allen, at Morristown, has now growing upon a poor barren,\r\ngravelly knoll, a crop of corn which might put to blush the owner of a\r\nrich and well manured field, and which ought to put to blush some of the\r\nunbelievers in the power of guano to produce such a growth upon such a\r\nsoil; rather where there was no soil, hardly enough to grow a\r\nrespectable crop of mullen stalks. Mr. Allen has tried guano for several\r\nyears upon every kind of garden vegetable, with the most wonderful\r\nsuccess. A crop of Lima beans now growing exhibit its wonderful power in\r\nthe strongest manner. The application has been made by a small dose at\r\nplanting and two sprinklings hoed in during their growth.\r\n\r\nA great many other persons in this State have produced most wonderful\r\neffects upon land almost utterly worthless, while in the immediate\r\nbenefits, those who have applied it to lands in good condition, have\r\nprofited more than with double the cost of manure.\r\n\r\n_Guano for Peach Trees._--A New Jersey nurseryman assured us of his firm\r\nconviction in the power of guano to cure the yellows in peach\r\ntrees--that no grub or worm can be found alive in the roots of a tree\r\nwhere guano is applied--that young trees can be brought into bearing by\r\nthe use of guano, a year earlier than by any other forcing process with\r\nwhich he is acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUANO ON LONG ISLAND.[1]\r\n\r\nOne gentleman assures us he tried an experiment very carefully, and\r\nfound an application of guano at two and a half cents a pound, 300 lbs.\r\nto the acre, more economical than hauling his own manure one mile. The\r\nfair value of team work and cost of labor hired, was more to the acre\r\nthan the guano, and the first crop quite inferior, the second no\r\ndifference, and the third slightly in favor of the manure. He thinks\r\nbuying city manure, particularly street sweepings, about the poorest use\r\nto which he could put his money, as he certainly could make 50 per ct.\r\nmore upon the same amount expended in Peruvian guano. Professor Mapes\r\nentertains the same opinion, about hauling manure, where guano, or\r\nrather with him, guano improved by the addition of his \"improved\r\nsuperphosphate of lime,\" can be procured.\r\n\r\nDr. Peck, a gentleman well known for his philanthropic motives in\r\nsettling and improving the \"Long Island barrens,\" has proved that every\r\nacre of that long neglected, and until quite recently considered\r\nworthless portion of the Island, can be rendered fertile, so as to be\r\ncultivated with great profit, either in farms or market gardens, by the\r\naid of this greatest blessing ever bestowed by Providence upon an\r\nunfertile land.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Messrs. Smith, of Smithtown, could show any Long Island\r\nfarmer who still has doubts upon the subject, that guano is the greatest\r\nworker of miracles in this age--that it is just as capable of producing\r\ngreat crops on the barren sands of the Island, as it is on the tide\r\nwater shores of Virginia, upon soil of the same character.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said in deprecation of the waste of fertilizing\r\nmatters in the city of New York, in which the writer of this pamphlet\r\nhas conscientiously joined; because, he thought it wicked to commit such\r\nwaste, while we were surrounded by lands lying idle, for the want of\r\nthese very substances. Precious, however, as they would be to the\r\nfarmer, he cannot afford to use them. That is, it would be poor economy\r\nfor a Long Island farmer, no matter how near the city, to expend money\r\nin the hire of men, vessels and teams, to save, carry, haul and apply to\r\nhis farm, the immense amount of fertilizing substances now wasted;\r\nbecause the same capital expended in purchasing and applying guano, will\r\nproduce a much greater profit. The difference in cartage is enough to\r\nastonish one who has never thought upon the subject. One man with a pair\r\nof horses can easily carry guano enough in one day, thirty miles into\r\nthe country, to manure ten acres of ground. To carry an equivalent of\r\ncity manure, in the same time, would require 300 pair of horses and 350\r\nmen. Who can wonder that barren lands have remained barren? Who will not\r\nwonder if they still continue so, with such fertilizers as their owners\r\nmight possess to render them otherwise? But few of the residents in the\r\ninterior of Long Island, if the manure was given to them, can afford the\r\ntime and team work to haul 300 loads for ten acres, while all can afford\r\nthe time for one load; and they may be morally certain the capital\r\ninvested in that load will be returned in the first crop. The great\r\nadvantage of guano over all other manures is, the concentration of\r\nimmense fertilizing power in such small bulk.\r\n\r\n_Guano in New York and Connecticut_, generally, has been less used than\r\nany sound reason will justify. A comparatively small portion of the\r\nmarket gardeners--a few gentlemen in the improvement of rural homes, and\r\nhere and there a nurseryman, have derived immense benefits; but the bulk\r\nof the farmers are still either faithless, or ignorant; in most cases\r\nthe latter, of the benefits they might derive from a liberal expenditure\r\nin the means, and the only means within their reach, of rendering their\r\nlands productive.\r\n\r\n_Effect of Guano on Garden Seeds._--From the society of Shakers, at\r\nLebanon, so justly celebrated for growing garden seeds, we receive the\r\nmost positive assurance that no manure ever applied by them, has had\r\nsuch an effect as guano. The production of seeds of all descriptions, is\r\nnot only increased, but the quality is improved to an astonishing\r\ndegree. The same effect has been noted upon wheat, particularly in our\r\naccount of Mr. Newton's operations. So also has it in England. This view\r\nof the case should give an additional value to guano to the farmer, as\r\nnot only an improver of the quantity of his products, but by the gradual\r\nimprovement in the quality of the seed, calculated to be of vast benefit\r\nto him in that respect. Garden seeds raised by guano, as soon as their\r\nsuperiority becomes known, will be in such demand that no other can be\r\nsold. Another advantage will arise from the fact that such seeds will be\r\nfound entirely free from weeds, as none grow after a few years upon land\r\nmanured only with guano.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful residence of Mr. Edwin Bartlett, near Tarrytown, exhibits\r\nstrong evidence of the fertilizing power of guano upon the poor,\r\nunproductive hill sides of Westchester Co. That place, now so luxuriant,\r\nwas noted a few years ago, as too poor to support grasshoppers. It was\r\nthe poverty stricken joke of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For interesting letters from Long Island, see appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGUANO IN MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nWe have heard a good many assertions that guano, however valuable it\r\nmight be upon the warm sandy soils of the south, would not answer in the\r\ncold land and climate of the New England States. To refute this fallacy,\r\nwe have some strong testimony. Seven years ago, while the very name of\r\nguano, and much more its virtues were unknown to half the farmers of\r\nAmerica, Mr. S. S. Teschemacher, of Boston, a gentleman of science and\r\npractical skill in gardening, became so fully convinced of its value to\r\nthe cultivators of American soil, he published a pamphlet for the\r\npurpose of inducing others to profit by its use. From that pamphlet we\r\nmake a few extracts. He says--\"One of the numerous objections to this\r\nmanure is, that, although it may answer well in the humid atmosphere of\r\nEngland, it cannot produce equal benefit in the hot, sandy soils of this\r\ncountry. In reply to this, it may be observed, that the sandy soils of\r\nSouth America are more hot than they are here; and, on the coast of\r\nPeru, where it is most used, it scarcely ever rains at all. The truth\r\nis, that it certainly requires moisture to decompose it, and enable it\r\nto enter into the juices of the plant; by no means, however, so much as\r\nis usually supposed; but, once absorbed by the roots and plants, it\r\nimparts that strength and solidity which enable them to resist both\r\ndrought and cold.\r\n\r\n\"It is beyond dispute that guano contains the chief ingredients required\r\nfor the growth of plants. The instances hereafter adduced will show that\r\nthe combination and form of these ingredients are such as to promote not\r\nonly its immediate action, but clearly to accelerate considerably the\r\nprogress of vegetation.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief ingredients, then, of guano, are,\r\n\r\n  Ammonia, in various forms and combinations;\r\n  Phosphate and oxalate of lime and magnesia;\r\n  Salts of potash and soda;\r\n  Animal organic matter;\r\n  Sand and moisture.\r\n\r\nBesides the evidence we have given of the value of an application of\r\nsuch a compound, it contains evidence within itself to every mind embued\r\nwith any knowledge of agricultural chemistry, that it will not only\r\npromote immediate growth of vegetation, but produce a lasting benefit to\r\nthe soil. It contains all the materials necessary for the growth of\r\ncereal or esculent vegetation in the exact form required--that is an\r\nimpalpable powder--to promote rapid, certain, large growth, and abundant\r\nfruitfulness, and consequent profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS BY MR. TESCHEMACHER.\r\n\r\nTo Indian corn, applied one teaspoonful to the hill, well mixed with\r\nearth, at time of planting. When twelve or fifteen inches high, hoed in\r\nthree tea spoons full around the corn, and covered two inches deep and\r\nwatered. Soil--a poor, sandy, sterile one. Product--one seed produced\r\nthree main stalks with eight perfect ears and five suckers, weighing\r\n8-1/4 lbs. The best plant without guano, weighed 1-1/4 lbs. and only had\r\none ear.--\"I find the best mode of applying guano is to hollow out the\r\nhill, put in one teaspoonful and a half of guano, and mix it well with\r\nthe soil. Spread even, then put on this about one or one and a half inch\r\ndepth of light soil, on which sow the seed and cover up. When the corn\r\nis about twelve inches high, or the time of first hoeing, begin with the\r\nhoe about four inches from the stems, and make a trench the width of the\r\nhoe about two or three inches deep. Spread in this trench about three or\r\nfour teaspoonfuls guano, stir it in, and cover the trench as quickly as\r\npossible. If this last operation can be performed just before or during\r\nrain, the action will be quicker and more effectual.\"\r\n\r\nFour or five teaspoonfuls of dry powder producing such an effect, is\r\nwhat staggers the belief of those who see with their own eyes.\r\n\r\nSo great is the luxuriance of growth from such an insignificant\r\napplication, it is necessary to increase the space nearly double between\r\nthe hills. In a country where fodder is so valuable as it is in\r\nMassachusetts, the great increase of stalks is of equal importance with\r\nthe increase of grain. Indian corn requires both phosphate of lime and\r\nmagnesia which it finds in guano, in combination with ammonia, in a\r\nstate just ready to be absorbed by the growing plant, wherever brought\r\nin contact, with its roots.\r\n\r\nMr. T. found the guanoed corn planted May 22d, ripened sooner than that\r\nplanted May 1st. with manure. This alone on account of the difficulty\r\nfrom frost, is sufficient to give it great claim upon northern farmers.\r\n\r\n_Effect on Grass._--\"The application of this manure to grass land\r\nalready laid down is for many reasons often attended with uncertain\r\nresults. The best mode is, to spread broadcast about 250 lbs. per acre\r\nof the Peruvian guano as soon as the snow is off the ground. It would be\r\nvery advantageous if, after it was spread on, some light loam could be\r\nput over it, in the manner of a top dressing. I state the Peruvian guano\r\nis the best for this operation, as it contains what Dr. Ure calls\r\n_potential ammonia_, or ammonia in a more permanent form; whereas the\r\nammonia from the Ichaboe guano evaporates more easily, and this valuable\r\ningredient is therefore lost in the atmosphere when it is spread on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\"Most excellent crops have been obtained, where the grass is sown and\r\nlaid down in the autumn, on light, sandy soils, by sowing the guano\r\nevenly broadcast, then harrowing twice, sowing the grass seed, and\r\nrolling.\"\r\n\r\nThe best mode of applying it, however, is to sow broadcast and plow it\r\nin--at the south, on sandy soils, no matter how deep--at the north on\r\nsoils more clayey, plow it in about four inches deep--the real object\r\nbeing to so mix it with the soil as to prevent the escape of ammonia,\r\nwhich is exceedingly volatile. Remember, _Guano_ should never be used as\r\na top dressing, except in combination with plaster, or some other\r\nsubstance which will prevent the escape of the most valuable portion of\r\nits composition.\r\n\r\nIn several case, where sods have been laid down for lawns or\r\nembankments round houses, the most surprising growth has been obtained\r\nby strewing the surface with guano previous to laying on the sod.\r\n\r\nE. Baylies, of Taunton, sowed 460 lbs. African guano per acre, with\r\ngrass seed, which yielded, this year, one ton per acre more than that\r\nwithout; and the appearance of the guanoed grass is now much more thick,\r\nluxuriant, and promising, for next year than the other.\r\n\r\n\"Another friend of mine sowed grass in sandy soil with a full quantity\r\nof manure, and an adjoining acre, with 400 lbs. Ichaboe guano. The\r\nguanoed acre grew stronger, and retained its full verdure the whole\r\nwinter; the manured piece, on the contrary, became, as usual, brown by\r\nthe action of the frost.\"\r\n\r\nMr. T. as well as nearly all the English writers upon the subject, has\r\nnoticed the improvement in quality as well as quantity of grain and\r\ngarden vegetables. It is a well authenticated fact, that birds wont\r\ntouch the manured wheat, while they can obtain that which is much more\r\nplump and rich where guano has been applied.\r\n\r\n_Effects on Trees and Grape Vines._--\"The experiments with guano on\r\ntrees which have come under my observation, including exotics number\r\nabout one hundred and fifty. The action has invariably been to produce\r\nlarge foliage, of a deep healthy green.\"\r\n\r\nThe best mode of applying guano to fruit-trees, or flowering shrubs, is\r\nto dig it into the earth at such distance from the trunk as will be\r\nlikely to meet the largest number of fibrous roots.\r\n\r\n\"For instance, round an apple-tree of ten years' standing, dig a trench\r\none or one and a half foot deep, at about the same distance from the\r\nstem that the branches extend; let this trench be about one foot wide;\r\nthen put at the bottom one and a half inch depth of guano, dig it well\r\nin, and incorporate it with the soil; then cover up carefully and press\r\nthe earth down. The effect of this application will unquestionably be\r\nfelt for several years.\"\r\n\r\nOn grape vines, the action of guano has been proved exceedingly\r\nbeneficial; increasing the growth of vines and fruit, improving the\r\nflavor and hastening the ripening, so as to escape early frosts.\r\n\r\nIn planting young trees, put about a pint in the bottom of the hole\r\ncovering with soil so the roots will not touch it. No insects or grubs\r\nwill disturb the roots of such a tree.\r\n\r\n\"Several friends, who have tried guano this year on their pear-trees,\r\nhave reported to me the result to be greater crops, and of a much larger\r\nsize, than they ever had previously.\"\r\n\r\n_Guano on Peas_--_Method of Applying._--The kinds on which I\r\nexperimented were Prince Albert, Shilling's early grotto, (a dwarf pea,)\r\nblue imperial, and marrowfat. Draw a deep trench with a hoe, strew guano\r\nin the trench, mix it up with the soil, over this put about one inch and\r\na half of earth, then sow the seed, and cover up. The quantity used\r\nshould about equal the quantity of seed. The produce of the three first\r\nkinds of peas, was five full pecks to the quart of seed, besides a full\r\nquart of seed gathered for next year. From the marrowfats I obtained\r\nonly four pecks and a half, and no seed. The growth of all was extremely\r\nluxuriant. The marrowfats were six and a half feet high, the stems from\r\none to one and a quarter inch in circumference. Guano should be placed\r\nat such a depth that the natural moisture of the earth will decompose it\r\nand render it fit for the plant. In the lightest soils--plow and bury\r\nguano a little deeper than in others more heavy; the guano itself\r\nretains moisture, and absorbs it naturally.\r\n\r\n_Guano on Beans_, doubled the yield of a paralel row, while the improved\r\nflavor was perceptible to those who had no idea of the cause which\r\nproduced it. In drouth, the power given plants by guano, to resist the\r\nscorching rays of the sun, is remarkable.\r\n\r\n_On Melons_, the effect was equally favorable, giving a large increase\r\nof highly flavored fruit.\r\n\r\n_On Potatoes._--We give out of many equally favorable, only one\r\nexperiment, just to show the ability of farmers to grow this crop in the\r\nmost unsuitable soil, by a small expenditure for guano, twenty per cent.\r\nbetter than with manure. Here it is. \"Soil, very sandy and light;\r\nquantity, 800 lbs. African (per ship Samos) to the acre; cost, $20. Same\r\nsoil, with twenty-two loads fine compost manure, cost $22. Yield, as\r\neleven to nine, or twenty-two per cent. in favor of guano, the potatoes\r\nwith which were larger than the others.\"\r\n\r\n_On Turnips_, no manure is equal to guano. The crop has been doubled in\r\nnumerous instances. Mr. T. says of one experiment he made, \"The plants\r\non this portion are now twice as large as those which have not had any.\r\nIt is perfectly beautiful to see the luxuriance of all these guanoed\r\nvegetables compared with the others.\"\r\n\r\n_On Strawberries_, nothing has ever been applied equal to guano,\r\nprovided the plants are plentifully watered. The best mode of\r\napplication is in solution. One pound is enough for ten gallons of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_On Cauliflowers._--Two experiments, one with guano, the other with a\r\nsolution. The first are fine strong plants, particularly one to which I\r\ngave a larger share than the other; it is heading finely. But those with\r\nthe solution are much larger and finer. I have been accustomed to\r\nobserve the cultivation of this vegetable, and never saw such a\r\nluxuriant growth. They are now, (Sept. 15th) beginning to show flower;\r\nand, if the season is favorable, I expect the heads will be very fine.\r\nThe plants are at least four times larger than those on the same piece\r\nwithout guano, or any manure at all, planted on the same day, from the\r\nsame seed bed.\r\n\r\n_On Rhubarb or Pie Plant_, guano has the most decided beneficial effect,\r\nincreasing the size, flavor and tenderness of the stalk; besides the\r\nvery great advantage of bringing it forward some two or three weeks\r\nearlier in the spring. Fork it in all over the bed, just as early as the\r\nfrost will permit, at the rate of 600 lbs. to the acre.\r\n\r\n_On Asparagus_, the same treatment will more than double the quantity of\r\nthis excellent, healthy vegetable. In the fall, give a dressing of\r\nsalt equal to 15 or 20 bushels to the acre. With the guano, nothing\r\nelse need be applied, if it is thoroughly mixed with the soil.\r\n\r\n_For Vegetables, Plants, Trees, and Shrubbery generally_, where fruit is\r\nan object, apply the guano as above, in powder. Where flowers of rare\r\nsize and beauty are desired, apply it in solution, or by frequently\r\nstirring in small dressings just before a shower. Another important\r\nobservation on this subject is, that guano, or its solution, should\r\nnever be applied except at that period of the season when the growth of\r\nwood is proper and natural.\r\n\r\n_In forcing houses_, nothing can be equal to guano. One thing, it\r\nproduces no weeds, or insects; this is enough to insure its favor\r\nwherever it may be tried.\r\n\r\n_On roses_, the beneficial effect is already well known. If tea roses\r\nare cut down when the bloom is over, repotted in fresh earth, and well\r\nwatered twice or thrice a week, with guano water, they will immediately\r\nthrow out luxuriant shoots, and be covered with their fragrant blossoms.\r\nThe cactus tribe will bear a larger quantity and stronger solution of\r\nguano, without injury, than most other plants.\r\n\r\n\"During the progress of my experiments,\" says Mr. T., \"I have been\r\ndelighted with the unfailing and extraordinary luxuriance of growth and\r\nproduce on a miserable spot of land, induced by the use of this manure,\r\nand struck with the numerous instances which have come to my knowledge\r\nof erroneous applications of it. On a stiff clay, guano would be of\r\nlittle value, except on the surface, or an inch or two deep, unless it\r\nwere considerably lightened by the addition of sand, or well broken up\r\nby exposure, in ridges, to frost, as every clay soil should be. A light,\r\nporous, sandy soil would require 300 lbs. Peruvian, or 400 lbs. best\r\nIchaboe; and for this soil I think the Peruvian best adapted, as it\r\nretains the ammonia longer, and, being less soluble in water than the\r\nIchaboe, its qualities are not so soon washed out.\"\r\n\r\nIn a soil already much enriched with manure, and at the same time\r\nabounding in phosphate of lime, I have found the guano to produce less\r\nvisible effects than on a poor, sandy soil.\r\n\r\nMost excellent effects have been produced by steeping seeds in guano\r\nwater of moderate strength for eight to twelve hours, dependent on the\r\nkind of seeds, and then planting with one to three inches soil between\r\nthe seed and the guano. The steep encourages the growth of the young\r\nplant, whose roots, in a more advanced stage, find the guano, which\r\ncontinues the stimulus.\r\n\r\n_Quantity for a Steep._--Put one, one and a half, or two teaspoonfuls of\r\nguano, according to quality, in a quart bottle, shake up, and when\r\nsettled, use; then refill and use two or three times, previous to\r\nputting in fresh guano. Or, in the large way, from fifteen to twenty\r\ngallons of water to one pound; mix in a barrel, stir up and leave it to\r\nsettle, taking care, however, to put a cover on, to prevent the escape\r\nof ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS AS TO QUANTITY AND MANNER OF APPLYING GUANO TO VARIOUS CROPS\r\nAND SOILS.\r\n\r\nThe best action of guano is undoubtedly upon naturally poor or worn out\r\nlight sandy soils. Next sandy loam--then loam proper--then clayey loam\r\nor exhausted gravelly soil, and lastly cold stiff clay, or land\r\nnaturally wet. Upon the first particularly at the south, it should\r\nalways be plowed in from four to six inches deep; and will always afford\r\nthe greatest profit when applied to wheat land and that sown with\r\nclover.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of guano for use._--Until some ingenious Yankee invents a\r\ncheap mill by which he will make a fortune and the lumps be easily\r\nground, the following method may be pursued. Take the bags on the barn\r\nfloor or in some close room with tight floor and sift the guano over a\r\nbox, through a 3/8 mesh sieve, putting the fine back in the bags and\r\nlumps on the floor. These may be mashed with a stout hoe or shovel, or\r\nwith a block like a pavier's rammer. Sift and break again until all is\r\nfine. Lay the dust with a very slight sprinkle from the nose of a\r\nwatering pot; of a solution of copperas, at the rate of 10 lbs. to the\r\ncwt. of guano, or with plaster or loamy earth--woods mould or dry fine\r\nclay. Many persons prefer to mix plaster with the guano in the first\r\ninstance at the rate of a peck of plaster to a bushel of guano--others\r\nuse an equal weight of each. Where plaster is not to be had, from five\r\nto ten bushels of pulverized charcoal or dust from the coal pit, or\r\npulverized peat, to each hundred weight of guano may be used to fix the\r\nammonia and prevent loss. Sulphuric acid 1 lb. to 10 of water, with\r\nwhich to sprinkle the mass may be used as a fixer. But if it is kept in\r\nthe bags, in a dry room, until ready for use, and then prepared, sown\r\nand plowed in at once with as little exposure to the air as possible,\r\nvery little of the ammonia will escape. The true axiom to be observed in\r\nthe use of guano, is to plow it in as soon as possible after it is sown\r\nand before it is moistened with dew or rain; and to plow it in deep, or\r\nin some way thoroughly incorporate it with the soil, so that rains will\r\nnot wash it away, or hot sunshine cause it to evaporate. We hold all\r\ntop-dressings with guano, to be wasteful, on account of its volatile\r\ncharacter, and because it needs the moisture in the earth to fit the\r\nsubstance of which it is composed so its fertilizing properties can be\r\ntaken up by the roots of the plants. If spread upon the surface, it must\r\nwait for a dissolving shower to carry it down to the roots; in the\r\nmeantime, it is moistened by dews and evaporated by the sun, and carried\r\noff to enrich your neighbor's crops half as much as your own.\r\n\r\n_Preparing Land and Sowing._--When ready to plow the land for wheat,\r\nmeasure an acre and lay it off in lands 18 feet wide; put the guano in a\r\npail and walk up one side and down the other with a moderate step\r\nthrowing handfulls across at each step, and you will find you do not\r\nvary much from two hundred pounds to the acre. Never sow in a windy day\r\nif it can be avoided, nor faster than it can be plowed in the same day.\r\n\r\n_To prevent guano from getting into the mouth and nostrils._--Take a\r\nthin piece of sponge and wet it and tie over the mouth and nose.\r\nWhenever the dust accumulates, wash it out. If you must sow while the\r\nwind is blowing, mix earth enough with guano to prevent blowing away.\r\n\r\n_Depth it should be plowed in._--On light sandy land, there is no danger\r\nof its ever being plowed in too deep. On sandy loam, it ought to be\r\nplowed under at least six inches--eight inches would be better. On true\r\nloam, a less depth will answer, though we are strong advocates of deep\r\nplowing. On clayey loam, four inches will answer, and on clay,\r\nparticularly in the Northern States, if well harrowed or put in with the\r\ncultivator, there will be no great loss of ammonia, as the clay is a\r\ngreat absorber of that volatile substance. This rule may in general be\r\nobserved; upon the light lands of the south, it cannot be too deeply\r\nburied; in the clay lands, or in the more heavy, cold, or moist lands of\r\nthe north, it may be covered too deep to benefit the first crop; but, if\r\nthe after cultivation is good, whatever is planted will be sure to be\r\nbenefitted. Upon granite soils, it will be of less value than silicious\r\nor aluminous ones. Though most valuable on poor sandy or worn out old\r\nfields like those of Virginia, already described, still it must not be\r\nrejected by the owner of any land which can be improved by manure,\r\nbecause this is a manure of the very best and most concentrated kind;\r\ncontaining more of the ingredients necessary to promote vegetable\r\ngrowth, in the exact proportion and combination, ready prepared for use,\r\nthan any other substance in the known world. It is a fertilizing\r\nsubstance which none will reject who once learn its value, unless very\r\ndeeply prejudiced. It is idle to reject it because the Peruvian\r\nGovernment wont let us have it at our own price, because we can profit\r\nby it at theirs. It is nonsense to say, it will answer in the moist\r\nclimate of England, but not in our dry one. Truth deduced from\r\nexperience, in several States, in various climates and soils, refutes\r\nall such sayings. Besides, it has been used with continued success in\r\nthe burning sun and soils of Peru, ever since the conquest by the\r\nSpaniards, and, according to tradition for ages untold previous to that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Guano on Wheat._--We repeat, sow broadcast and plow in upon all light\r\nlands, _deep_; at the rate of 200 to 600 lbs. to the acre, as you can\r\nafford, or as the land requires--we believe in the small quantity and\r\nrepeat the next sowing, to be by far the most judicious. On heavy lands\r\nyou may harrow or cultivate it in, but the plow is better. It will do\r\nwell on lands previously limed, but should never be mixed with lime or\r\nashes, unless mixed with plaster or charcoal. If you must use it as a\r\ntop dressing in the spring, mix a bushel of plaster with every hundred\r\nof guano, sow and harrow in--don't be afraid of injuring the wheat\r\nAlways sow clover or grass on guanoed grain.\r\n\r\n_On Indian Corn._--Follow the same directions as for wheat, or if the\r\nland is already rich, and you wish to give the corn an early start,\r\nscatter at the rate of 100 to 200 lbs. guano in the furrow, and cover it\r\ntwo inches deep with another furrow and then drill the corn. Be sure and\r\nnever let the seed come in contact with the guano, or you will kill it\r\nmost certainly. Guanoed corn should be sowed in wheat, particularly\r\nwhenever it has been dressed with a large quantity.\r\n\r\n_To growing Corn_, if it is desirable to apply it, turn a furrow away\r\nfrom the row on each side and scatter in the bottom at the rate of 300\r\nlbs. per acre, and turn back the earth immediately.\r\n\r\n_Green Corn_--roasting ears--are improved in taste by guano beyond\r\nanything ever conceived of by the lovers of this luscious food.\r\n\r\n_Quantity per acre._--Thomas S. Pleasants of Petersburg, Va., a\r\nwell-known writer upon agriculture, and who has had much practical\r\nexperience ever since the first introduction of guano into this country,\r\nsays:--\"_Corn_ is a gross feeder and will take up a greater quantity of\r\nguano than perhaps any other crop. I have known as much as 600 lbs.\r\napplied to the acre and the product was in proportion. Each hundred\r\npounds will give an average product of ten bushels as various\r\nexperiments have proved From the above mentioned application of 600 lbs.\r\na product of 73 bushels was obtained, which left 13 bushels as the\r\nproduct of the soil alone. For corn, guano may be spread broadcast on\r\nthe land and ploughed in as deeply as it is desirable to break the soil;\r\nor it may be strewed along deep furrows to be afterwards ridged over and\r\nthe cultivation to be in only one direction. The best result I ever\r\nobtained was from this latter mode, when from land not capable of\r\nproducing five bushels, I harvested a crop that could not have been less\r\nthan 35 bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\n\"The furrows were opened deep and wide by passing the plow both ways and\r\nthe guano strewed along these at the rate 1 lb. per every ten yards.\r\nThey were then covered over and the land thereby thrown into beds. But\r\nin whatever way it is used, the roots of the corn will be sure to find\r\nit all, and between these two modes, I think there is little or no\r\nchoice. I would certainly advise against putting it in the hill, though\r\nI have sometimes seen good results. It is difficult, however, in such a\r\ncase, to prevent the guano and seed from coming into close contact;\r\nand, unless there are two or three inches of earth interposed between\r\nthem the seed will be certainly destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n_For wheat_, the guano should be spread broadcast at the time of\r\nseeding the wheat, at the rate of 200 lbs. to 250 lbs. per acre and\r\nploughed in. If the land has been previously fallowed, it will be\r\nsufficient to plow it in with a one horse plow; if broken up for the\r\nfirst time, there will be no objection to using a larger plough. The\r\nbest depth for getting it in, however, is, I think, from four to six\r\ninches. It always acts more powerfully on clean land; indeed if there is\r\nmuch crude vegetable matter in the soil, there is frequently little or\r\nno advantage derived from its application. Experience, therefore goes to\r\nshow that the most economical application is to corn land; that is, to\r\nland that has just produced a crop of corn, no matter how poor it may\r\nbe. If it is intended to be put on land that has been lying in grass, it\r\nwould be advisable to fallow it as early in the season as practicable,\r\nand afterwards to get it in with a small plow as already suggested.\r\n\r\nThe same direction will apply to oats and also to rye. But for oats, 125\r\nto 150 lbs of guano will be as much as can be used to advantage.\r\n\r\nA. B. Allen of New York, one of the earliest, and most strenuous\r\nadvocates of using guano, who, long before he ever thought of being\r\nengaged in its sale, used to distribute small parcels among farmers and\r\ngardeners to enable them to try experiments and learn its value, in a\r\nletter to the Southern Cultivator, says:--\"Never put guano in the hill\r\nwith corn, no matter if covered two or three inches deep; for the roots\r\nwill be certain to find it, and so sure as they touch the guano, so\r\ncaustic is it, that it will certainly kill the corn; the same with peas,\r\nbeans, melon vines, in fact most vegetable crops. Wheat and other small\r\ngrains have so many roots, and tiller so well, there is no danger of\r\nguano killing them, when sown directly with the seed. Still, as before\r\nremarked, it is better to plough it in before sowing the seed.\r\n\r\n\"After corn is up, you may apply a table spoonful, at the first time\r\nhoeing; dig it an inch or two deep six inches from each stalk. A table\r\nspoonful to the hill will take 250 to 350 lbs., per acre, according to\r\nthe distance the hills are apart. If the soil be rather poor, a second\r\ndose at the time the corn first shows its silk, will add considerably to\r\nthe yield in grain, if followed by rains, but little or nothing to the\r\ngrowth of stalk. Guano increases the size of grain more than stalks;\r\nhence one must be content to wait till the grain is fully matured before\r\ngiving an opinion of the virtues of guano.\r\n\r\n\"Before applying the guano, it is better to mix it well with an equal\r\nquantity of plaster of Paris or charcoal dust. Either of these\r\nsubstances help to retain the ammonia and prevent its evaporation.\r\n\r\n\"The genuine unadulterated Peruvian guano, is so much superior to any\r\nother kind, it is in reality the _cheapest_, though the price is\r\nconsiderable higher than that of the other qualities.\"\r\n\r\n_Guano on Oats._--Mr. Allen says, \"I am satisfied from experience and\r\nobservation in the use of guano, for the past twelve years, that the\r\nbest method, decidedly, of applying it to crops in our dry climate, is\r\nto plow or spade it into the ground; and autumn is the best time for\r\ndoing this, as it gives time for the pungent salts contained in the\r\nguano, to get thoroughly mixed with the soil before spring planting. Do\r\nnot fear to loose the guano by plowing it in as deep as you please--it\r\nwill not run away, depend upon it. At the south, it loses half its\r\nvirtue if not plowed in at least three inches deep; six or twelve inches\r\nwould be still better.\"\r\n\r\nBecause \"autumn is, for many reasons, the best season\" for applying\r\nguano, as a general thing, we do not recommend an application to this\r\ncrop, notwithstanding our full conviction it will increase the product\r\nupon any light, poor soil, from ten to twenty bushels to the acre, for\r\neach cwt. applied. As some however, will find it more convenient and\r\nprofitable to manure the oat than wheat crop, we recommend them to plow\r\nin from 200 to 300 lbs. to the acre, on ground that was clean tilled the\r\nprevious year, and sow the oats in drills, three or four bushels to the\r\nacre and seed with clover, herds, or ray grass. If not to be followed\r\nwith grass, we would use a much less quantity; say 125 or 150 lbs. to\r\nthe acre. As may be seen in the account of Mr. Harris' crop, not one\r\nhalf of the 400 lbs. was taken up by the oats. With wheat, on the\r\ncontrary, the guano is dissolved more slowly by winter rains, giving the\r\ncrop a vigorous growth in fall, and sometimes all winter, so it sends\r\nout double the number of stalks in spring. The sun too, is so much less\r\npowerful at that season, evaporation does not take place so easily as in\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n_Great Crops from Guano._--In England, 48 bushels of wheat and 100 of\r\noats have been made from an acre dressed with 200 lbs. of guano. A late\r\nEnglish writer, in detailing his own experiments, and urging others to\r\nthe same course, says; \"The reason guano is serviceable to all plants\r\narises from its containing every saline and organic matter required as\r\nfood. It is used beneficially on all soils; for, as it contains every\r\nelement necessary to plants, it is independent of the quality of the\r\nsoil. So far as the experiments in England and Scotland may be adduced,\r\none cwt. of guano is equal to about five tons of farm-yard manure, on an\r\naverage; but it is much higher for turnips than for grass.\"\r\n\r\n_Guano on Grass._--As we are opposed to using it as a top dressing, of\r\ncourse we shall not recommend its application to this crop. Generally,\r\nby using it on wheat and other crops, the farmer will save manure enough\r\nto top dress his meadows. Nevertheless, in combination with proper\r\ningredients, we do say it is a good and profitable manure for grass. For\r\neach acre mix from 200 to 400 lbs. with as many bushels of plaster, or\r\nten to one of charcoal, or twenty to one of dry swamp muck or peat,\r\nwoods mould or fine clay, and sow upon the meadow or pasture early in\r\nspring. If the season is moist, the benefit will be very great; if dry,\r\nit will probably be said, as it has been before; \"Oh, this guano is good\r\nfor nothing--I tried it once on grass and it never done a bit of good.\"\r\n\r\n_On potatoes_, 400 lbs. to the acre, broadcast, may be used to good\r\nadvantage, if it is plowed in deep enough, on clean land. As it is a\r\ncaustic manure, and requires a good deal of moisture, as well as\r\npotatoes, it is not suitable for the hill or surface dressing. A less\r\nquantity will pay a greater profit to the immediate crop, without much\r\nafter benefit, if it is drilled in the bottom of a deep furrow and then\r\ncovered by turning two furrows, one from each side, so as to leave a\r\nslight depression between them, and directly over the guano. Upon these\r\nbeds plant the tubers in drills. After hoeing, scatter a mixture of\r\nequal parts of lime, salt, ashes and plaster, a large handful every\r\nyard, all over the rows, and we will warrant the crop free from the\r\npotato rot.\r\n\r\n_On turnips_, nothing can exceed guano, unless the phosphate of lime in\r\nbones could be rendered equally pulverulent. Use 3 to 600 lbs. per acre,\r\nand plow it in at the last plowing, and top dress with five bushels of\r\nashes and two of salt as soon as the turnips are up. Follow with wheat\r\nor rye and grass. One half the above quantity and five bushels of bone\r\ndust dissolved in sulphuric acid, will produce a wonderful crop of\r\nturnips, or ruta bagas. Guano may be used to equal advantage upon all\r\nkinds of root crops.\r\n\r\n_Benefits to the Dairy Farmer._--The beneficial use of guano in the\r\nmanufacture of butter and cheese, is unquestionable. In many districts\r\nin England, and in some in this country, the continual cropping of grass\r\nand conversion of it into cheese, has so exhausted the soil of its\r\nphosphates, the milk will no longer produce the quantity of casein\r\nnecessary to make cheese making profitable. When this is the case, you\r\nwill find the cows seeking to supply the deficiency by eating bones.\r\nWherever guano has been used upon pasture land, it is found that cows\r\neat the increased luxuriant grass most greedily, and improve not only in\r\nquantity but quality of their milk. We cannot, therefore, recommend too\r\nearnestly, to all dairy farmers, to give their pasture lands an\r\nimmediate dressing of guano. If you have not full faith in what we are\r\ntelling you, try an experiment for yourself. Mix 200 or 300 lbs. of\r\nguano with two or three bushels of plaster, and that with two or three\r\nloads of charcoal dust from the bottom of some coal pit, or from burnt\r\npeat, or swamp muck; or, if the charcoal is not attainable, use woods\r\nmold, or powdered clay or fine loam, to any extent you can afford; and\r\nif you can afford nothing but the guano and plaster, don't fail to\r\nafford a dressing of that, because it will afford you a rich return. No\r\nother manure can be used upon pasture land, to produce the same effect.\r\nCattle never reject the grass of guanoed land, as they do that lately\r\nmanured.\r\n\r\n_On Flax._--Experiments in England have proved guano superior to any\r\nother substance ever applied to this crop. With the aid of this manure,\r\nfarmers will never complain of flax exhausting the soil. With 300 lbs.\r\nper acre, successive large crops can be grown upon the same ground. It\r\nshould be plowed in, but not so deeply as for some other crops, as it is\r\nnot expected to benefit succeeding ones as much as the present. As soon\r\nas the \"flax cotton\" movement now progressing is fully understood, there\r\nwill be immense fields of flax grown for that purpose, and the best and\r\nmost economical fertilizing material, and for which there will be a\r\nlarge demand, will be Peruvian guano; for no good farmer will attempt to\r\ngrow a crop without it. A top dressing of 25 or 30 bushels of ashes to\r\nthe acre will be found beneficial; but farmers ought to try which is\r\nbest, more guano and less or no ashes, or the reverse. We cannot advise\r\nrotation with this crop, where guano is used, because the ground becomes\r\nso clean and free from weeds, it is of great advantage, and so far as we\r\nare informed, continuous good crops result from the annual application\r\nof the same quantity of guano, year after year.\r\n\r\n_On Cabbages._--Field culture. After the ground is well prepared, lay it\r\noff in checks three to four feet square. With a spade, throw out a deep\r\nspit at each check and put in a spoonful of guano, or at the rate of 400\r\nlbs. per acre, and cover with soil. Set the plants immediately and water\r\nif possible. After the first hoeing, throw a handful of ashes on each\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n_For Carrots, Beets and Parsnips_, plow in 500 lbs. per acre, twelve to\r\neighteen inches deep. Top dress with ashes, salt, and fine manure in\r\ncompost, to assist the young plants; the long roots will find the guano\r\nand it will produce such a crop as you never saw before.\r\n\r\n_On Hops._--Make a mixture of three cwt. of guano, one of salt, one and\r\na half of saltpetre, and one of gypsum, for each acre; sow broadcast and\r\nplow in about four inches deep, and you will find your manure well paid\r\nfor, and no exhaustion of the soil, as is usually the case wherever this\r\ncrop is cultivated, as it is a very gross feeder, and requires very rich\r\nland or great deal of manure; for which reason it is not as much\r\ncultivated as it will be as soon as the virtues of the above application\r\nbecome fully known.\r\n\r\n_For Tobacco_, guano has been found to possess superior qualities,\r\nparticularly in obviating the difficulty heretofore experienced in\r\ngetting plants sufficiently early. We have the testimony of several\r\nwitnesses to prove that burning a seed bed is quite unnecessary, if\r\nguano at the rate of 400 to 600 lbs. to the acre be mixed with an equal\r\namount of ashes, and plaster and well raked in previous to sowing. Of\r\nthe effect upon the crop, we give the testimony of a Virginia planter.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of 1850, I applied 200 lbs. to the acre, on eight acres\r\nof land, which had been manured three years before for tobacco, and the\r\nsame quantity, on three acres which had never been manured, and was very\r\npoor. On the last I also turned in some half rotted straw, raked up in\r\nthe barn yard, after all the farm yard manure had been hauled out.\r\nBetween these two pieces of land, 19 acres were heavily manured. The\r\nwhole 30 acres had been well broken with four horses, early in the\r\nwinter. The last year was the worst I have ever known for tobacco.\r\nNevertheless, the first eight acres produced a very fine crop--the last\r\nthree acres brought much better tobacco than the adjoining manured land,\r\nI should say not less than 600 lbs. to the acre.\"\r\n\r\n_Wheat on Guanoed Tobacco Land._--This field was sown with wheat, and\r\nthe writer says--\"I measured from these 30 acres next year upwards of\r\n600 bushels of wheat of very fine quality; both pieces of guanoed land\r\nbeing _above_ the average of the whole lot. Adjoining the _three_ acres\r\nis an equal quantity of land of the same quality, which did not yield\r\nfive bushels to the acre.\"\r\n\r\nOf the effect upon another crop of wheat, the same gentleman says--\"Two\r\nyears ago I purchased three tons, two of which I applied to 20 acres of\r\na James River hill, which though not gullied, had been a good deal worn\r\nby hard croppings, or bad cultivation, or both combined. The Guano was\r\nsowed _dry_, and on the wide rows laid off for sowing wheat, and\r\nploughed in with two horses, the wheat then harrowed in. I forgot to say\r\nthat the land had been fallowed in with three horses in the month of\r\nAugust, and the wheat sowed in October. In consequence of the dryness of\r\nthe guano, and the width of the rows, the wheat was very much striped,\r\nbeing very luxuriant where the guano fell in the largest quantities. The\r\nproduct did not exceed 200 bushels, or 10 bushels to the acre, but the\r\nquality was so superior that I saved it all for seed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The land sowed two years ago, is now _striped with clover_, as it was\r\nwith wheat.\"\r\n\r\nThis land is a tenacious red clay formation, from which the soil we\r\npresume has all been washed away \"long time ago.\" No planter, he says,\r\nwould have put such land in tobacco without heavy manuring; and yet it\r\nproduced a fair crop of tobacco. Owing to distance from navigation, he\r\ncould not use lime, or any heavy manure, and without guano he could not\r\nmake crops, and, consequently could not make manure at home.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the American Farmer, in a note says--\"Our correspondent\r\nappears to desire that his land should be brought to a state of\r\nfertility by the _quickest_ practicable process, and from the beautiful\r\nresults of his experiments with guano, we know of no agent to which he\r\ncould look with so much certainty of success as to that very manure.\"\r\n\r\n_The quantity per acre for Tobacco._--We should recommend at least 400\r\nlbs. sown broadcast and plowed in, on such land as described, not over\r\nfour inches deep. The tobacco to be followed with wheat, the wheat with\r\nclover, the clover after one year with corn and then tobacco and guano\r\nagain. The clover should have a bushel of plaster fall and spring.\r\nWhoever tries this will find the benefit of guano on tobacco. But there\r\nis one still greater benefit; we have been assured that the tobacco worm\r\nwhich it was supposed from his natural taste, nothing could nauseate,\r\nactually gets sick of guano, and refuses his accustomed food.\r\n\r\n_Another mode of applying_ it to tobacco has been practised successfully\r\nas follows:--Mark off the land in checks and put a small spoonful in\r\neach check, and cover up directly under the bed where the plant is to\r\nstand, three or four inches deep. To this a handful of ashes and plaster\r\nmay be advantageously added. Guano does not give tobacco the rank flavor\r\nthat is often acquired from high manuring.\r\n\r\nMr. Pleasants, although many experiments have failed, principally, as he\r\nbelieves, from improper application, says in a recent letter--\"There is\r\nno actual reason why guano should not act as well on tobacco as any\r\nother crop. The failures are doubtless to be ascribed to the injudicious\r\nmanner in which it has been applied. I can conceive of only one mode in\r\nwhich it can be used to advantage, and that is by strewing it along a\r\ndeep furrow as described for corn; then bedding upon it and confining\r\nthe cultivation to one direction. This has been my way of cultivating\r\ncabbages for the market for several years, and the guano has always\r\nacted promptly and powerfully. If chopped in at the base of the hill it\r\nwould require a great quantity of rain to dissolve it and make it\r\navailable to the young plants, for the conical shape of the hill has a\r\ntendency to shed the rain instead of absorbing it. I expect soon to\r\nreceive very accurate results of a crop grown with guano, which Judge\r\nNash represented to me as splendid. If I cultivated tobacco, I should\r\nhave every confidence of success by planting it on ridges with the Guano\r\nburied at a considerable depth, say from four to six inches beneath the\r\nsurface of the ridge--1 lb. to ten yards would be a sufficient quantity.\r\n\r\n\"In short, I consider guano good for any crop. For potatoes (that is\r\nIrish potatoes) I regard it as a specific manure. The quantity I apply\r\nis 3/4 lbs. to every ten yards put in the furrows as recommended for\r\ncorn and tobacco, and then covered over about one inch with earth drawn\r\nfrom the sides of the furrows. After this the potato cuttings are\r\nplanted and covered over with the plough or hoe. The quantity\r\nrecommended is about right as far as my experience goes (which is of\r\nseveral years duration) if the cuttings are placed about two inches\r\napart.\"\r\n\r\n_Guano for Cotton._--But few trials upon this crop have come to our\r\nknowledge, but such as have, indicate that it will prove one of the most\r\nvaluable promoters of the growth of this staple product of America ever\r\ndiscovered. The analysis of cotton--stalk, seed and lint--compared with\r\nthat of guano, is sufficient to prove the latter to be the very matter\r\nrequired to produce the former. We are assured upon the most reliable\r\nauthority that guano will give an average increase of pound for pound\r\nupon any soil producing less than a bale per acre so that every pound of\r\nguano costing two and a half cents, will give a pound of cotton\r\naveraging at least 6-1/4 cents.\r\n\r\n_Mode of applying on Cotton Land._--Open a deep furrow and drill in the\r\nbottom at the rate of 400 lbs. to the acre, upon land usually producing\r\n300 to 500 lbs. seed cotton, and less for a better quality of land, down\r\nto one-fourth the quantity. Bed on this as deep as you please; the\r\nmoisture of the earth will disengage the ammonia and phosphates, and\r\nsend their fertilizing properties up to the roots. Never use guano as a\r\ntop-dressing for cotton. The seed will be found better matured, and\r\nconsequently more valuable to manure another crop, besides being so much\r\neasier separated from the lint, which will be found as much improved in\r\nquality as quantity. For Sea Island planters, where manure is so\r\nvaluable and so hard to obtain, we would earnestly recommend a thorough\r\ntrial of guano. As the land for this crop is mostly prepared with hoes,\r\ncare must be taken that the servants do not neglect to bury it at the\r\nvery bottom of a good bed.\r\n\r\nFrom the knowledge the writer has of the culture and value of long\r\nstaple cotton, and the price and value of guano, he has no hesitation in\r\nexpressing his honest conviction that a clear profit of two to four\r\nhundred per cent. may be made upon every dollar expended in the purchase\r\nand proper application of guano to that crop.\r\n\r\nGuano, for all staple crops in the United States, is no longer an\r\nexperiment. It has been clearly demonstrated, to be the cheapest and\r\nmost valuable fertilizer, particularly for all poor, worn out, hard used\r\nand exhausted soils ever discovered; which no sensible man will neglect\r\nto profit by, as soon as he learns its value, unless prevented by deep\r\nprejudice or strong circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Application to Miscellaneous Crops._--Under this head we will give the\r\nexperience of several individuals in various sections, soils and\r\nclimates, in hopes it may encourage the doubtful, and direct those who\r\nare disposed to emerge from darkness into the light of scientific\r\nagriculture. A gentleman from Warsaw, Virginia, where the soil is\r\ngenerally a sandy loam, badly worn by long years of bad tillage, says,\r\n\"My wheat looks finely, especially where I applied guano last fall. I\r\nput it in with the seed furrow about three inches deep, and also with\r\ndouble plow six inches deep, harrowing in the wheat frequently side by\r\nside. At this time I can see no difference in the wheat crop. I use a\r\nlarge wooden toothed harrow extending over the bed of ten feet, and an\r\neven soil, free from stone; they do admirable work and drill the wheat\r\nas if put in with the drill.\"\r\n\r\nWilloughby Newton, whose operation we have already spoken of, says; \"I\r\ndo not believe it possible to improve a farm, on the old three shift\r\nsystem, of corn, wheat and pasture, without a large supply of foreign\r\nmanures. If clover can be substituted for pasture in the summer, then\r\nthe land, if not naturally poor, may be rapidly improved by the use of\r\nlime alone, in addition to the putrescent manures that may, by proper\r\ncare, be made on the farm. On other land of less fertility, and drier, I\r\ngreatly prefer the five field system, under which, with the use of lime,\r\nguano and clover, a rapid improvement may be effected at the same time\r\nthat heavy crops of wheat are reaped.\"\r\n\r\nAnother writer in speaking of how to improve worn out lands, says; \"Let\r\nwhatever little surplus he can spare from supplying the necessary wants\r\nof his family be laid out in the purchase of some one of the reliable\r\nconcentrated manures. [Guano is by far the cheapest, and therefore the\r\nbest for him, if he will plow it in well]. And my observation and\r\nexperience have convinced me that he may make such improvement as will\r\nbring him a quick return, and soon enable him to get his farm well set\r\nin grass. This once effected, his facilities for its further improvement\r\nwill assuredly increase in a ratio just in proportion as he is careful\r\nto pursue the course indicated. If a farmer can succeed in getting his\r\nfields well set in grass, a large and long array of facts and experience\r\nhave proved that he may then, under a judicious course of management,\r\nrender them more and more fertile without foreign aid of any kind\r\nwhatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe editor of the American Farmer, in deprecating the price of guano\r\nsays, \"Of the efficacy of guano, in restoring worn out lands to\r\nproductiveness--of its capacity to increase the yield of any lands in a\r\nsound condition--there cannot be a doubt; but even with all its\r\nregenerating properties, we do think that its market value is too high.\r\nForty-eight dollars for a ton of 2,000 lbs. of Peruvian guano is more\r\nthan it is intrinsically worth, and should it be continued thus high,\r\nmust, we should think, limit its use, for the obvious reason, that\r\nfarmers cannot afford to pay a price for it which is so disproportionate\r\nto its real value.\"\r\n\r\nYet they do continue to pay, and make it pay a greater profit than any\r\nother manure ever purchased. We hold to have done as much as any other\r\nindividual to reduce the price of guano, and wish as heartily as does\r\nthe editor of the Am. Farmer, it was only half the price it now is; yet,\r\nwe must counsel our readers not to wait for that cheap time coming. It\r\nis now cheaper than it was then, and probably as low as it will be for\r\nyears; and in the hands of the present agents, the public may depend\r\nupon a regular supply, and of genuine quality, at what the Peruvian\r\ngovernment deem a fair price.\r\n\r\n_Guano for Melons and other Vines._--Mr. Pleasants, of whom we have\r\nbefore spoken, and whose long experience in the use of guano in\r\nconnection with a market garden, entitle him to a high degree of credit,\r\nsays, \"I have been in the habit of using it for several years, and can\r\ntestify to its value, not only using it for melons, but for the whole\r\ntribe of cucurbitacæ. The mode of application which I prefer is this;\r\nwhen the ground is prepared and checked off, remove the loose soil at\r\nthe intersections of the furrows, leaving clear spaces on the substratum\r\nof not less than eighteen inches in diameter. Upon these spaces sprinkle\r\nguano, at the rate one pound to eight hills. Follow with a hilling or\r\ngrubbing hoe, and incorporate the guano with the subsoil; then draw the\r\nloose earth back, and finish by chopping a small quantity, a spadeful or\r\nless, of well rotted manure into the hill near the surface. Guano placed\r\nnear the surface, will remain almost inert, and buried deep, as I\r\nrecommended, it will be too remote from the seed to give the young\r\nplants the quick start which is indispensable to an early crop of\r\nmelons. The small quantity of manure near the top of the hill answers\r\nthe purpose of immediate forcing, and enables the roots to strike\r\nrapidly into the guano, when the growth of the vines will be stimulated\r\nto such a degree as to cause them to mature their fruit a week or ten\r\ndays earlier than they would do from either guano or manure alone.\r\nMelons equally fine may be raised from nothing but guano, applied in the\r\nmanner directed; but they will not be an early crop, from the fact that\r\nthe plants remain almost stationary until the roots reach the guano.\r\nLast year, from such a preparation as is now recommended, I had as fine\r\na crop of melons as I ever saw; and they began to ripen at a very early\r\nperiod in the season. Two years ago, I had them nearly or quite as good\r\nfrom guano alone; but they were late. This year the crop was almost a\r\nfailure, from the wetness of the season, which caused the vines to die.\r\nCantelope melons, however, have produced abundantly, grown entirely with\r\nthe aid of guano. Where manure is scarce, I have no doubt an admirable\r\ncompost might be prepared, consisting of guano and rich earth. It\r\nshould be made several weeks, or even months, before it is wanted for\r\nuse; and the heap worked over frequently in order to bring it into a\r\nsuitable condition. Such a compost would doubtless supply the place in\r\nthe hill which I have assigned to the manure. For pumpkins, squashes,\r\ncymblins and cucumbers, when it is not particularly desirable to have\r\nthem early, nothing more is necessary than to prepare the hills with\r\nguano.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter of E. G. Booth, to F. C. Stainbrook,\r\nwritten in that plain familiar style of one friend to another, which\r\ncharacterises the man, with an evident intent to do good; though it was\r\nnot designed for publication, we give it because we believe it will do\r\nothers good, as well as the recipient. Mr. Booth confirms our opinion\r\noften expressed, that the poor old barren fields of lower Virginia, are\r\nreally more valuable than the rich lands of the west; because, owing to\r\nfacilities of intercourse with commercial cities by water, these lands\r\ncan be bought, and cultivated by aid of guano, with more profit than the\r\nrichest prairie farm in Illinois. Mr. Booth's testimony upon the\r\ndurability of this manure, is enough to contradict all the assertions\r\nthat \"it is of no use for only one crop.\" On his land, strangers can\r\neasily tell where guano was applied four years previous.\r\n\r\n\"Yours of the third has been received, and it affords me pleasure to\r\ngive you any information in my power. The wheat crop during the the\r\nwinter was very unpromising. There was a general complaint that it was\r\ntoo thin. The Poland wheat (most generally sown in this neighborhood,)\r\nis said to branch more than other kinds, and I regard the present\r\nprospect of the wheat crop as flattering, particularly where guano was\r\nused. It is now a fixed fact, that no poor land ought to be cultivated\r\nwithout guano, by any person who can command the money or credit to buy\r\nit. It is remarkable that it pays a much better profit, or per cent. on\r\nthe investment, on poor land, than rich. I was inclined for some time to\r\nbelieve that the difference was really in appearance alone. The\r\ndifference of five bushels increase on land which without it would bring\r\nonly fifteen--or in other words, an increase from fifteen to twenty\r\nbushels to the acre, would not be very perceptible, while an increase of\r\nfive bushels on land previously making only five, would be very evident.\r\nStill, the real increase would be five bushels in each case. I am now\r\nhowever, decidedly of the opinion that it pays a much larger per cent.\r\non poor than rich land; because it supplies that in which poor land is\r\ndeficient, and of which rich land may have enough. I have it now in\r\nstrips on a clover fallow, scarcely showing any difference. I last\r\napplied it on about the poorest land on my plantation, and the product\r\nwas remarkable. This circumstance much reduces the difference between\r\nthe value of poor and rich land, and admonishes us that there is not a\r\nplot in our wide extended surface, which need be abandoned or neglected.\r\nWe can, if we manage properly, support a population which will out vote\r\nthe West in 1865. There is another fact which experience confirms, that\r\nis it is much more durable than at first supposed. My visitors have been\r\nable to point out the strips of land on which it was sown, four years\r\nafter its application. I noticed a very evident effect on the farm of\r\nMr. William Fitzgerald, a few days ago. He last year put it in drills,\r\nand hilled on them for tobacco, in the fall the whole surface was sown\r\nin wheat, which is now growing in ridges corresponding with the furrows\r\nwhere it was placed.\r\n\r\n\"While on the subject I will mention another fact different from first\r\nimpressions, viz: that it is more productive, (the first crop, at\r\nleast,) when harrowed in with the grain, on the surface, than when\r\nturned in very deep. I have yet to satisfy myself which is most durable.\r\nIn the experiment which lasted four years, I think it was turned in. The\r\npurchases the ensuing fall will be very large. Those who were most\r\nincredulous are now going in largely. A very intelligent and\r\nenterprising friend of mine, who has been improving his land judiciously\r\nand profitably in this way, related to me an anecdote which occurred to\r\nhim. He had two neighbors remarkable for their judgment and success in\r\nfarming as well as other things, who, however, were inclined to\r\nunderrate his expenditure of money in these elements of improvement.\r\nThey knew he had purchased and used a ton of guano, and thought they\r\nknew where he had used the whole of it. They went, not exactly by night,\r\nbut rather privately, to examine into the result. They made their\r\nobservations and calculations, and agreed that he had got his money\r\nback, but no profit worthy consideration, and were only confirmed in\r\ntheir opposition to such an expenditure. The truth was, however, that\r\nonly about one eighth of the ton had been used where they calculated for\r\nthe whole. One of these gentlemen, I am informed, is now about the\r\nlargest purchaser of such articles in the county; and perhaps the other\r\nalso, though I have not been informed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPLASTER WITH GUANO.\r\n\r\nA Virginia farmer, in a letter of December 1847, in speaking of using\r\nplaster with guano, and the effect says--\"I am a firm believer in the\r\nmerits of the mixture, and always use it. I have used it on turnips with\r\ndecided effect, as decided as that following any application of guano I\r\never saw. Several farmers of my acquaintance used the mixture of guano\r\nand plaster, and stable manure and plaster habitually, like myself, and\r\none told me he used it half and half, producing the most marked effect\r\non wheat, and that a neighbor of his had used it in the same proportion\r\nwith the same effect--the usual surprising effect of guano. For myself,\r\nI used some $400 worth of guano on wheat this fall, the whole of it\r\nmixed with plaster. I believe the effect of the mixture will not be so\r\nvigorous on the first crop, as guano by itself--the plaster husbanding\r\nthe ammonia for succeeding crops, upon which the mixture, (if the theory\r\nbe correct,) will have more effect than guano unmixed, that being\r\nexhausted by the first crop.\"\r\n\r\nA gentleman after making sundry careful experiments with plaster and\r\ncarbonate of ammonia, thus expresses his conclusions--\"These experiments\r\nprove to me that no matter in what state, (whether _wet_, _moist_, or\r\n_dry_,) plaster is presented to guano, or any other manure from which\r\nthe carbonate of ammonia is escaping, it must retain a certain amount of\r\nammonia that would otherwise be lost in the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nThe editor of the American Farmer says--\"If the soil be poor, and it be\r\ndesired to permanently improve it, at least four hundred pounds of\r\nguano, without respect to the fixer used, should be spread _broadcast_,\r\non every acre of it, and plowed in to the full depth of the furrow. If\r\nthe land be in moderate heart, three hundred pounds will be enough per\r\nacre. Where the soil may be good, two hundred will be sufficient. These\r\nquantities, as the reader will observe, have relation to broadcast\r\napplications, as all should be where general improvement is\r\ncontemplated; if compelled to confine his experiments on corn to\r\napplications in the hill, a form of manuring, we have ever disapproved,\r\ntwo hundred pounds, or even one hundred of guano, will manure an acre,\r\nmixed with a bushel of plaster, five bushels of slaked ashes, and a\r\ndouble horse cart of wood mould more effective than ten loads of manure\r\napplied in the hill.\"\r\n\r\nYes, as has been proved by careful experiment made in England, more than\r\nfourteen tons of manure. The editor also says, what we have so often\r\nrepeated--\"We hold these to be agricultural truths--that guano is most\r\nbeneficially applied, when ploughed in as spread on the the earth, never\r\nless than four inches deep--and better, for permanent effect, to be\r\nploughed in deeper, say six to eight inches--where it may be desirable\r\nonly to bury it four inches deep, the land should be previously ploughed\r\nas deep as the furrow can be turned up, and the guano applied at a\r\nsecond ploughing--that all top-dressings with guano are wasteful,\r\ninasmuch, as from the volatile nature of the more active parts of the\r\nmanure, great loss must inevitably result from all such applications,\r\nand because, more moisture than is to be found on the surface, is\r\nnecessary to excite, and carry on, that healthful progressive state of\r\ndecomposition, which is required to render guano most available for\r\npresent production and future improvement.\r\n\r\n\"We do not hesitate to express the opinion, that when properly used, as\r\nan adjunct to lime or marl, that it will bring up any sound worn out\r\nland, to at least its original degree, if not a greater degree of\r\nfertility; provided its application be followed by clover. We believe\r\nthat, when properly applied to land, either limed or marled the previous\r\nyear, it will add twenty-five, thirty, and, in some instances, forty per\r\ncent. to the product of wheat; besides infusing into the soil, the\r\ncapacity to grow luxuriant crops of clover, and thus fit it for\r\nprofitable future culture. If it will do this, and we are certain it\r\nwill, then it will achieve all that any agriculturist can reasonably\r\nexpect of it, or of any other fertilizing agent; and we are very sure\r\nthere is no other manure equally efficacious, within the reach of\r\nfarmers and planters.\r\n\r\n\"Guano differs much in quality; that from Peru, is confessedly best of\r\nany which has yet been submitted to actual experiment by agriculturists,\r\nor tested by the analysis of chemists, being much richer in its\r\nnitrogenous element, than either the Patagonian or African variety.\"\r\n\r\nHe also says--\"400 lbs. of guano and 1 bushel of plaster, will ensure a\r\ngood crop of corn, so will 200 lbs. guano and eight bushels of bone\r\nearth, or 20 bushels of bone earth, 10 bushels of ashes and 1 bushel of\r\nplaster. Each to be ploughed in.\"\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said in favor of using plaster with guano, or some\r\nother fixer of ammonia, wherever it is exposed, on or near the surface.\r\nWe add a few more extracts mainly to show that deep ploughing, and\r\nplentiful manuring, are the sure guarantee of bountiful crops.\r\nBone-dust, except when used in the drill, should always be harrowed in.\r\nIt should be put in bulk with other matters, and excited into an\r\nincipient state of decomposition before being used.\r\n\r\nGuano should always be ploughed in, if practicable. Harrowing and\r\ncultivating in guano \"have been practised both in this country and in\r\nEngland, by intelligent farmers; and in various instances have been\r\nspoken approvingly of, success having attended such applications in\r\nsingle crops; but we doubt whether much, if any permanent benefit were\r\ndone to the soil, in qualifying it for the production of the subsequent\r\ncrops of a course of rotation. In Peru it is used topically, but such\r\napplications are always followed by immediate irrigations of the soils\r\nto which it is applied, the Peruvians acting upon the philosophical\r\nprincipal, whether they comprehend its theory or not, that to secure the\r\nnutrient properties of this active fertilizer to their growing crops, it\r\nis essential that they provide an absorbent, and that they find in the\r\nwater furnished by their processes of irrigation. Experience, practice,\r\nand irrigation have taught them, that unless they cause the carbonate of\r\nammonia, and the various compound substances with which it exists in the\r\nguano, to descend speedily to the roots of their plants, that from the\r\nvolatility of its more active and efficient elements, they will be\r\nexpelled by the heat of the sun, escape into the air, and be lost for\r\nall the purposes of vegetable growth.\r\n\r\n\"But in view of the whole ground, taking into consideration the\r\nevanescent nature of any ammonia in guano in the compounds in which it\r\nexists, to be converted into that form, we honestly believe, that so far\r\nas lasting benefit to the land may be concerned, guano should be\r\nploughed in.\r\n\r\n\"In all tolerably good Guano, there is a sufficiency of the carbonate\r\nalready formed to carry on healthful vegetation, and therefore, it is\r\nbest to place it sufficiently deep to prevent the waste of an element so\r\nessential to the growth of plants, and so liable to loss.\r\n\r\n\"It is possible where the soil had been, by repeated harrowings, reduced\r\nto a state of very fine tilth, that guano may be covered sufficiently\r\ndeep with the Cultivator to become mixed with, and consequently be\r\nabsorbed by the vegetable remains of the earth, and thus be prevented\r\nfrom loss by escape of its volatile gases; especially would this be the\r\ncase, if the process of cultivating it in, were soon after followed by\r\npenetrating rains. In admitting this, we still adhere to the opinion,\r\nthat so far as permanent benefits are concerned, the most economical\r\nmode of applying guano to the earth, is by the plough.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the guano is ploughed in, the wheat should be sowed and\r\nharrowed in, in the usual way. In our climate we can sow wheat on the\r\npoorest corn ground late in November and have as fine a crop, and\r\nharvest it as soon, as we can obtain from well prepared and fallowed\r\nwithout guano sowed early in the season, For every 100 lbs. of guano,\r\nnot exceeding 250 lbs. we calculate on reaping of an average season from\r\nsix to seven bushels, sometimes eight. From a greater quantity though\r\nthe product will be increased, yet it will not be increased in the same\r\nproportion, and 200 lbs will also be sufficient for the production of\r\ntwo good grass crops following the wheat and will then leave the land in\r\nan improved condition.\"\r\n\r\n_Charcoal and Guano._--The benefit of charcoal with guano will be\r\nunderstood from the following extract from \"Scientific Agriculture,\" on\r\nthe nature of charcoal and its use as a manure.--\"Charcoal on account of\r\nits power of absorbing gases and destroying offensive odors, is a\r\nvaluable addition to the soil; its operation as a manure is not so\r\ndirect as some other manures; that is, it is not so useful on account of\r\nany element it furnishes to plants, as by the intermediate office which\r\nit performs, of absorbing and retaining in the soil those volatile\r\nmatters which plants require, and which would otherwise escape and be\r\nlost. It is beneficial as a top-dressing, and as an ingredient in\r\ncomposts; it evolves carbonic acid in its decomposition, and is in this\r\nway directly useful to plants. Its powerful antiseptic properties\r\nrender it very useful to young and tender plants, by keeping the soil\r\nfree of putrifying substances, which would otherwise destroy their\r\nspongioles and prevent their growth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd its capacity to absorb many times its bulk of gaseous matter, will\r\nalways give it value as an absorbent of escaping ammonia from surface\r\ndressings of guano.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Farmer also says--\"In our climate, we should be\r\nopposed to all topical applications of any strongly concentrated manure\r\nlike guano by itself,--and, indeed we should, under all circumstances,\r\nprefer to have it ploughed in, if practicable; but as we presume our\r\ncorrespondent has been prevented by circumstances, from using guano at\r\nthe time of ploughing for wheat; and of course, must avail himself of\r\nthe next best plan of deriving benefit from its use, we would advise,\r\nhim next spring, as soon as the frost is out of the ground, and it is in\r\na state to bear a team; to mix, in the proportion of 100 lbs. of guano,\r\none bushel of fine charcoal, and one peck of plaster per acre, then to\r\nsow the mixture over his wheat field, lightly harrow the ground, and\r\nfinish by rolling; and we have no hesitation in saying, that his wheat\r\ncrop will be benefitted more than twice the cost of the manure. We say\r\nto him farther that he need not fear injuring his wheat plants by the\r\noperation of harrowing and rolling; for, on the contrary, it will act as\r\na working, and prove of decided advantage. We feel very certain that the\r\nadmixture of charcoal and plaster with guano, together with the covering\r\nit will receive by the harrowing, will prevent any material loss of the\r\nammoniacal principles of the latter; as independent of the affinity\r\nexisting between charcoal, plaster, and all nitrogeneous bodies, they\r\nwill be greatly aided by the vital principle of the plants themselves.\r\nWe are not, however, left to the lights of theory alone, in this matter,\r\nbut have the experience of the Honorable Mr. Pearce, of Kent county, of\r\nthis State, to guide us to a practical result,--he used, some years\r\nsince, a top-dressing of guano and plaster upon his wheat field, and was\r\nrewarded by a large increase of crop.\"\r\n\r\nA correspondent says--\"I am satisfied from experience and observation in\r\nthe use of guano for the last twelve years, that the best method,\r\ndecidedly, of applying it to our crops in this dry climate, is to plow\r\nand spade it into the ground; and autumn is the best season for doing\r\nthis, as it gives time for the pungent salts contained in the guano to\r\nget thoroughly mixed with the soil before spring planting. Do not fear\r\nto lose the guano, by plowing it as deep as you please--it will not run\r\naway, depend upon it. At the south it loses half its virtue if not\r\nplowed in at least three inches deep; six to twelve inches would be\r\nstill better.\r\n\r\n\"Spread broadcast on grass land, late in the fall or early in the spring,\r\nif not plowed in before sowing buckwheat, rye or wheat, then spread it\r\nbroadcast after sowing the grain, and harrow well and roll the land.\r\nThis last operation is quite important.\"\r\n\r\n_Value of Guano on account of its Phosphates._--He who wishes to have\r\nthe best grazing grounds, where he can present the richest and most\r\nnutritious herbage to his cattle, will keep his ground well supplied or\r\nmanured with guano that abounds in phosphates, knowing that it will\r\nsupply the needed nutriment to the grass, and by the grass to the\r\ncattle; and thus his stock will be kept in a high condition and full\r\nflesh, either for the farm or the market.\r\n\r\nAgain; he who raises wheat, corn, or other grains, has an equal\r\ninducement to look to it that his manures are abundantly impregnated\r\nwith these essential elements. Phosphates, so available to the raiser of\r\nstock, are equally so to the producer of grain; because the size,\r\nrichness, and nutritious qualities of the grain depend largely on the\r\npresence of these in the soil. A farmer, therefore, has a vital interest\r\nin this matter, and should obtain what best suits his purpose. The most\r\nintelligent English farmers are so well convinced on this point, that\r\nsubstances containing only ten per cent. of phosphate of lime, are\r\nsought after, dissolved in sulphuric acid and water, and sprinkled on\r\nthe soil. Bone dust also is used, and to a certain extent, is available,\r\nbecause one of the principal constituents of bones, is phosphate of\r\nlime. But the article in which the phosphates are the most convenient,\r\nbecause the most minutely distributed, is guano; and this, when\r\njudiciously used, must find favor wherever it can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThat which contains a large proportion of phosphates, in combination\r\nwith ammonia, nitrogen and alkaline salts, apparently in the exact\r\nproportion required by nature, such as analysis and experience proves is\r\nthe case with Peruvian guano, will be sought after by every farmer who\r\nreads the evidence of its value which we have given in these pages.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to talk of bones to restore the waste of phosphates in the\r\nsoil that is being constantly carried away in grass and grain, beef,\r\npork, mutton, milk and cheese, much of which passes into the sea from\r\nthe sewers of cities, to be there retained in that great reservoir for\r\nthe future use of men. It is from that we are now drawing our present\r\nsupplies. Happily for mankind in all civilized countries, the discovery\r\nof guano has, in a providential manner, met the very wants of the times,\r\nin reference to the reinvigoration of certain kinds of soil, since this\r\nmanure furnishes the elements most needed to supply the waste arising\r\nfrom cultivation, and to develop vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of procuring bones enough to supply the wants of the\r\ncomparative few now engaged in using guano, may be readily learned by\r\nany farmer who uses ten tons of guano per annum, if he will undertake to\r\n\"pick up bones\" enough to furnish him the same amount of phosphates\r\ncontained in that quantity of guano. Then if all who are now using it,\r\nwould drop guano and take to bones, it would soon be found to be hard\r\npicking. Save all the bones and apply them to the soil, is a standing\r\ntext with us; upon the same soil use all the guano your can procure and\r\nyou will not need to pick bones--you will grow bones to pick. It may be\r\nvery patriotic to talk about expending the money at home, for bones,\r\ninstead of sending it to Peru, for guano; but that talk is all for\r\nBuncombe, there is not a particle of sound reason in it. If all the\r\nbones in the United States could be saved and applied to the land again,\r\nwe should still fall short of a supply, and be obliged to do as England\r\ndid before the introduction of guano; go about and ransack grave yards\r\nof great battlefields, for more bones. With all the guano imported, or\r\nthat will be imported, and all the bones that will be saved, there will\r\nstill be room for more phosphates in the millions of acres of hungry\r\nsoil in America. What would be the effect if a few such farms as\r\nWilloughby Newton's, and Col. Carter's, who each use 30 to 40 tons per\r\nannum of guano, should come all at once into the bone market for their\r\nsupplies. In our opinion there would be such a rattling among the dry\r\nbones, we should hear no more about substituting them for guano. The\r\nfact is an incontrovertible one, that nothing on earth nor under the\r\nearth, or in the sea, has ever been discovered, which can be used as a\r\nsubstitute for guano. Its small bulk is alone sufficient to commend it\r\nto favor.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Agricultural Society of England offers a prize of £1,000 and\r\nthe gold medal of the society, for the discovery of a manure with equal\r\nfertilizing properties to the guano, of which an unlimited supply can be\r\nfurnished in England, at £5 per ton.\r\n\r\n\"_Analogy between Bones and Guano._--There is a striking analogy in\r\ncomposition between bones and guano, which is, for other reasons\r\ninteresting to the practical man.\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits the composition of bones compared with\r\nguano, supposing both in the dry state. Bones, as they are applied to to\r\nthe land contain about 18 per cent. of water. Ichaboe guano from 20 to\r\n25 per cent.\r\n\r\n                                  _Bones._      _Guano._\r\n\r\n  Organic animal matter,             33            56\r\n  Phosphates of lime and magnesia,   59            26\r\n  Carbonate of lime,                  4             6\r\n  Salts of soda,                      4            10\r\n  Salts of potash,                 trace         trace\r\n  Silicious matter                    0             2\r\n                                    ----          ----\r\n                                    100            100\"\r\n\r\nAnd these substances are found in guano already in a pulverulent state,\r\nwhile bones have to be reduced by mechanical or chemical means to the\r\nsame condition before they are of any use as manure. Do not, we again\r\nrepeat most emphatically, do not waste a bone; dissolve all you can get\r\nin sulphuric acid and mix with guano--save and make all the manure\r\npossible, both by the stable, compost heap and green crops, and then you\r\nwill have money to buy guano, by which you can save the immense labor of\r\nhauling to distant fields, and still have the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthem as fertile as those highly manured near home.\r\n\r\nWhen the farmer raises crops for sale, and removes his grain and grasses\r\nfrom the land, he sells a portion of his soil; and if he does not renew\r\nin some way the saline matters taken away in his crops, he invariably\r\nimpoverishes his farm. This work of exhaustion is now going on to an\r\nalarming extent, and the prolific wheat lands are to be searched for\r\nfarther and farther westward as the operation proceeds.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the superiority of wheat grown on newly cultivated\r\nlands, and most farmers are aware of the fact that soils become\r\nexhausted of something, they know not what, but of something essential\r\nto the most favorable production of grain. This something is found in\r\nguano, and by it the original fertility of land can be more easily, more\r\ncertainly and cheaply restored than by any other means as yet\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mapes in one of his letters of advice says; \"As no farm, under\r\nordinary usage, will supply as much manure as may be used upon it with\r\nprofit, I am glad you intend to use guano, as it is an admirable manure,\r\nreplete with many requirements of plants. The ammonia of the guano is in\r\nthe form of a carbonate, and therefore so volatile as to escape from the\r\nsoil into the atmosphere before plants can use it.\r\n\r\n\"You will readily perceive, therefore, that the sulphuric and phosphoric\r\nacids require amendments, and the ammonia should be changed from a\r\ncarbonate to a sulphate of ammonia, which is not volatile. All this may\r\nbe readily done by dissolving bone dust in dilute sulphuric acid, mixing\r\nit with the guano, and then with a sufficient amount of charcoal dust to\r\nrender the mass dry and pulverulent. The more charcoal dust the better,\r\nas it absorbs and retains ammonia, and after it is in the soil, will\r\ncontinue to perform similar offices for many years, only yielding up\r\nammonia as required by plants, and receiving new portions from rains,\r\ndews, &c.\"\r\n\r\nIf used as a top dressing, this change from a carbonate to a sulphate\r\nmay be necessary; but not so if well mixed with the soil, particularly\r\none in which clay predominates. In such a soil it is not even necessary\r\nto adhere to the direction to plow the guano deeply under. If it is but\r\nslightly harrowed in, the nature of the clay is such it will prevent\r\nthe escape of the ammonia. If you require phosphates, more than\r\nammonia, add the superphosphate of lime; but in no case omit the guano.\r\n\r\n_Use of Salt with Guano._--Common salt at the rate of a bushel to 100\r\nlbs. of guano, well mixed, may be used to good advantage either as a top\r\ndressing, or when plowed in. The effect of the muriatic acid of the salt\r\nupon the guano will be, as both are dissolved in the earth, or by dews\r\nand rains, to form muriate of ammonia, which is not volatile;\r\nconsequently the salt prevents loss by exhaustion, which is sure to take\r\nplace when the guano is used as a top dressing, unless prevented by\r\nsomething to act as a fixer of the ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of this law of nature in making the most precious saline\r\nmanure a fixed and difficultly soluble salt, is at once obvious; for it\r\nis thus kept always ready in the soil for the plants to act upon\r\naccording to their need. If we cut plants down before the seeds form, we\r\nhave all the phosphates the plants contain diffused throughout them, and\r\nif we allow the seed to ripen, the phosphates, as before observed, will\r\nbe found mostly in the seed. We find them in the state of phosphate of\r\npotash, phosphate of soda, phosphate of magnesia, and phosphate of lime,\r\nand probably, also, phosphate of ammonia. Now all these salts are\r\nessential to the growth and sustenance of animals, and without them\r\ngrain would cease to be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of restoring inorganic substances to the soil, may be\r\nbetter understood by examining the following table:\r\n\r\nMr. Prixdeaux states that the following quantities (of inorganic\r\nmatters) are removed from an acre of soil by a crop of wheat, of 25\r\nbushels of grain, and 3000 lbs. of straw--\r\n\r\n                   _By the grain._       _By the straw._          _Total._\r\n                             lbs.                  lbs.              lbs.\r\n  Potash,                    7.15                 22.44             29.59\r\n  Soda,                      2.73                  0.29              3.02\r\n  Magnesia,                  3.63                  6.99             10.62\r\n  Phosphoric acid,           15.02                 5.54             20.56\r\n  Sulphuric acid,             0.07                10.49             10.56\r\n  Chlorine                    0.00                 1.98              1.98\r\n                              ----                 ----              ----\r\n                             28.60                47.73\r\n\r\n  Gross weight to be returned to an acre,                           76.33\r\n\r\nProfessor Johnson says--\"Soils are barren either from the presence of a\r\nnoxious principle or the absence of a necessary element. It is therefore\r\nhighly important to be able to distinguish between the two cases.\r\n\r\n\"The art of culture is almost entirely a chemical art. Its processes are\r\nexplained on chemical principals in part, but partly on mechanical and\r\nnatural ones.\r\n\r\n\"All forms of matter may be divided into one of the two great\r\ngroups--organic or inorganic matter.\"\r\n\r\nIn Peruvian guano, both these substances exist in a better and cheaper\r\nform than can be obtained from any other source.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Genesee farmer, whose scientific information none can\r\ndispute, strongly corroborates this opinion. In a late number he\r\nsays--If we admit that phosphate of lime is a necessary ingredient in a\r\nspecial manure for wheat--Peruvian guano would at present be much the\r\ncheapest source of it; for, in addition to the 16 per cent. of ammonia,\r\nit contains 20 per cent. of phosphate of lime in first-rate condition\r\nfor assimilation by the plant, as well as other fertilizing ingredients\r\nof minor importance.\r\n\r\nAs a manure for wheat, therefore, we greatly prefer good Peruvian guano,\r\neven to the _improved_ superphosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n_Difference in favor of Guano over Bone dust._--Robert Monteith,\r\nEngland, dressed oat ground with 276 lbs. guano per acre, cost 31\r\nshillings, produce 59 bushels, value £7 7s 6d. Same quality of land with\r\n10 bushels bone dust, cost 23 shillings and fourpence, produced 43\r\nbushels value £5 7s 6d, which gives a balance in favor of guano of £1\r\n12s 4d, or about $7 50 per acre.\r\n\r\n_Difference in favor of Guano over Manure._--The Yorkshire Agricultural\r\nSociety of England, instituted a series of experiments several years ago\r\nfor the purpose of working out practical facts in relation to guano,\r\nthrough a series of crops, upon different soils, by different persons,\r\nupon whose report the utmost reliance might be placed, so as to\r\ndetermine the value, or advantage to British farmers, who might use this\r\nextraordinary fertilizer. This report has just been published, and the\r\nfollowing is a synopsis of the results. The experiments were arranged\r\nunder the following heads--\r\n\r\n1. To show the natural produce of the land, one part was to have no\r\nmanure whatever.\r\n\r\n2. Was to have twelve tons per acre of farm-yard dung.\r\n\r\n3. Was to have six tons of dung, and one cwt. each of guano and\r\ndissolved coprolites; and\r\n\r\n4. Was to have two cwt. of guano and two cwt. of the coprolites.\r\n\r\nOther substances might be tried as additions, but these were to be the\r\nstandard experiments.\r\n\r\nMr. Cholmeley's turnips, grown on a loamy soil had the heaviest crop on\r\nNo. 3, the dung, coprolite, and guano, beating the farm-yard manure by\r\nsome 5-3/4 tons per acre.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson's experiments were tried with various manures singly; and\r\nhis Peruvian guano gave the greatest weight of the class of substances\r\ntried; but 10 cubic yards of farm-yard manure had previously been\r\napplied to the whole land.\r\n\r\nMr. Maulevere's heaviest weight, also applied singly, was with the 12\r\ntons of dung; but only 14 cwt. more than the dressing with 2 cwt. of\r\ncoprolites. This soil was a light clay.\r\n\r\nMr. Newham's on a limestone soil, were the heaviest with No. 3--the\r\nsame as Mr. Cholmeley's--and were 16 cwt. heavier than an application of\r\ndung alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Outhwaite's, on a hungry gravel, were the heaviest, with 9-3/4 tons\r\nof dung and 2 cwt. of guano, for all the land had been dunged at this\r\nrate, and exceeded 14-1/2 tons of dung by 2 tons 9 cwt. per acre.\r\n\r\nMr. Scott's were the heaviest on No. 4,--the guano and coprolites, and 1\r\nton 7 cwt. more than 20 tons of dung,--his soil was a strong loam.\r\n\r\nMr. Wailes's were the heaviest, with 4 cwt. of coprolites, showing an\r\nincrease over 20 tons of dung of 2 tons 9 cwt. per acre; the soil is a\r\nuseful loam.\r\n\r\nThe first fact which strikes the observer, is, that as a general rule,\r\nthere is not only an addition to the crop by the addition of those\r\nartificial manures, but there is, in some cases, more absolute crop\r\nproduced by them than by farm-yard manure alone.\r\n\r\nNow to bring this to the test of figures, the coprolites at £5 per ton,\r\nand the guano at £10 per ton, will be at the rate of 2 cwt of each, £1\r\n10s per acre. Now assuming this to be equal to 20 tons of dung per acre,\r\nwe should require to be able to produce the dung at 1s 6d per ton to\r\ncost us the same money. But it can be neither produced nor purchased at\r\nany such money. In the whole of the cases referred to, the manure is\r\nmost costly, and yet we find hardly any case where there is not an\r\naddition to the crop, of say two to three tons of turnips per acre, by\r\nsuch an increase of manure as the guano. Now, if a ton of turnips be\r\nworth 10s., or even 9s, there is at once an element of repayment; for,\r\nif a soil be in a condition to give a large crop of turnips, it is\r\nalmost certain to be capable of giving a large crop of any other plant\r\nto succeed.\r\n\r\nMr. Charnock gives it as the result of his practical experience, that 4\r\ncwt. of Peruvian guano, without manure, is the cheapest and best mode of\r\ngrowing turnips; but the general testimony seems to be decidedly in\r\nfavor of what all farmers find it the best and easiest to do, viz., to\r\nadd a small quantity of artificial manure to that which the farm will\r\nsupply, and so to spread the whole over the land, rather than put all\r\nthe dung in one place, and all the artificial manure in another.\r\n\r\nNo one can doubt the true statement of this report, which proves $7 50.\r\nworth of guano equal to 20 tons of manure--reducing the worth of that\r\nto one shilling and sixpence--about 34 cents--per ton, or one dollar a\r\ncord. Now, as manure is often estimated in this country by the cord, and\r\nvalued at about $4, and applied at the rate of 6 cords per acre, it\r\nfollows that a saving of $14 50 per acre may be made by using 250 lbs.\r\nof guano instead of purchasing the manure. This Yorkshire experiment\r\nexactly corresponds with those made in this country, some of which we\r\nhave detailed, and which proves that a farmer cannot buy manure at the\r\ncommon selling prices; and if he hauls his own the distance of a mile,\r\nhe will expend more value of time, than it is worth to him on the land;\r\nbecause the same value of time--\"time is money\"--expended for guano,\r\nwill bring him better returns. In this, as before stated, we are\r\nconfirmed by Professor Mapes; and here is the opinion of Mr. Hovey of\r\nBoston, the eminent horticulturist, which we find in the August No. of\r\nhis magazine, as follows--\r\n\r\n\"If, after such evidence as this, farmers will continue to buy ashes at\r\neight cents a bushel, or manure at three to six dollars a cord,\r\nincluding carting, and use them alone, then let them do so, but they\r\nshould not complain that their crop cost more than it comes to. To\r\norchardists and fruit growers, this information is of the greatest\r\nvalue, and we trust they will not let it pass unheeded.\"\r\n\r\nThis opinion is valuable because it has been stoutly asserted, that\r\nhowever well guano might answer at the South, it was of no use in the\r\nhard soil and cold climate of New England. This is a fallacy which will\r\nsoon be cured by knowledge, and self-interest is a very strong prompter\r\ntowards the acquisition of the knowledge, that guano is the best,\r\ncheapest, most suitable, convenient and productive manure ever used by a\r\nNew England farmer, and just as suitable for that climate and soil as it\r\nis for Virginia. We assert, without fear of successful contradiction,\r\nthat there is not a farm--not a field--covered with five-finger vines\r\nand mullens, in the State of Massachusetts, which may not be made to\r\nproduce as profitable crops, by the use of guano, as any Connecticut\r\nriver farm. Farmers are about the hardest class of men in the world to\r\nlearn new doctrines; or that science has anything to do with the\r\nbusiness of this life, and what all other life in a civilized country is\r\ndependent upon. Yet science teaches, by unerring truths, that the plants\r\nthe farmer cultivates, are composed of carbon, obtained by plants\r\nchiefly from the soil and atmosphere; oxygen and hydrogen, obtained by\r\nplants chiefly from water, carbonic acid, &c.; nitrogen obtained by\r\nplants chiefly from manure, and also from rain and snow; silicium, in\r\ncombination with oxygen, called _silicia_ or sand; lime in combination\r\nwith phosphoric and other acids; potash and soda in combination with\r\nacids; magnesia, in combination with acids, and various oxides of\r\nmetals, the presence of which, however, is not very important, as they\r\nexist in an exceedingly small quantity. And that guano is composed of\r\nammonia (formed of nitrogen and hydrogen,) combined with carbonic,\r\noxalic, phosphoric, and other acids; lime, combined with phosphoric\r\noxalic, and other acids; potash and soda, combined with muriatic and\r\nsulphuric acids; magnesia, combined with phosphoric and other acids;\r\nanimal organic matter, containing carbon, and also nitrogen.\r\n\r\nNow, is it not enough to prove that all the ingredients, with the\r\nexception of the metallic oxides, exist in guano, which are required by\r\nthe plants grown for the sustenance of man.\r\n\r\nPutting guano into the soil, therefore, as a manure, is clearly\r\nrestoring to the earth those substances which plants abstract from it,\r\nand which are absolutely necessary for their growth.\r\n\r\nThe questions, then, which the farmer should now ask are, \"which is best\r\nfor me to buy, guano or coarse manure?\" The evidence just given answers\r\nthat question. \"I have manure, teams, and men to haul it; my fields are\r\nfrom one to three miles distant, is it economy for me to let my teams\r\nlay idle and buy guano?\" By no means. But you can probably employ men\r\nand teams in other improvements to much better advantage. With your\r\nmanure make all your home lots exceedingly rich. With your men and teams\r\nclear off stones, dig ditches to put them into, drain your land, or\r\nbuild fence--bring bog meadows and swamps into dry cultivation--send\r\nevery little brook through artificial channels for irrigation--send\r\nwater up from lowland springs and streams by hydraulic rams for the same\r\npurpose, and for stock on the hills; or bring it down from hillsides if\r\nyou are so situated; and buy guano for those distant fields, instead of\r\nwasting time in the laborious operation of hauling manure. Those who use\r\nguano, are enabled by the saving of time, to say nothing of their\r\nincreased profits, to make improvements which are utterly impossible to\r\naccomplish under the old system.\r\n\r\n_How to choose Guano._--As we are satisfied no sensible reader can have\r\nperused the preceding pages, without having come to the determination to\r\nmake a trial for himself, we will give him some general instructions\r\nabout buying guano.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we lay it down as an incontrovertible axiom, that\r\nthe Peruvian guano, at the current price for years of that and all\r\nother, is the cheapest and best, because it contains the largest amount\r\nof ammonia, in a perfectly dry state; as a carbonate, true, but because\r\ndry, it is permanent and not likely to loose by volatilization by long\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\nIf other varieties contain a larger proportion of phosphates, and are\r\nsold at a less price, experience proves they are not cheaper. If an\r\nadditional quantity of phosphates is desirable, it can be obtained in a\r\ncheaper form from dissolved bones, or bone dust and shavings of bone\r\nworkers; or from mineral phosphates of lime. Recollect, guano under no\r\nother name, has ever equalled the Peruvian, in the results as compared\r\nwith the quality or cost.\r\n\r\nTherefore buy none but Peruvian. To guard against deception, be careful\r\nof whom you buy. If you cannot buy directly from the agents, be sure the\r\ncharacter of your merchant is a sufficient guarantee against\r\nadulteration.\r\n\r\n_To test the quality of Guano._--The best test is the price. Unlike\r\nother merchandise, this article is not subject to fluctuations. Being a\r\ngovernment monopoly, the price at which the agents are to sell here is\r\nfixed in Peru, and that price may be easily known; therefore, if any\r\ndealer offers you Peruvian guano at \"a reduced price,\" you may be sure\r\nthe quality is reduced also. Remember, that the lowest price by the ship\r\nload, it can be procured for of the agents in Baltimore or New York is\r\n$46 per ton of 2240 lbs. To this, every fair, honest dealer, must add\r\nfreight, insurance and profit. Every man who sells without such\r\naddition, you may be sure will make his profit by short weight or\r\nadulteration.\r\n\r\nThe next best test is its appearance. Good Peruvian guano is an\r\nimpalpable powder, perfectly dry to the touch, of a uniform brownish\r\nyellow color, with a strong smell, like that of spirits of hartshorn,\r\ncontained in ammoniacal smelling bottles. But the smell is no test; that\r\nwhich smells strongest may be worst, as the ammonia may be disengaged by\r\nmoisture or by the addition of lime or salt.\r\n\r\n_The adulteration of guano_ is carried to a great extent in England, and\r\nprobably will be in this country. The principal adulterations are made\r\nby the addition of loam, marl, sand, plaster, old lime, ashes, chalk,\r\nsalt, moisture, and by mixture with other guano of a cheaper quality.\r\nThe farmer need not depend upon the assertion, \"this is a genuine\r\narticle--here is the inspector's certificate.\" We would not give a straw\r\nfor a corn basket full of certificates of analysis. The buyer must\r\nanalyse for himself. Mr. Nesbit, analytical chemist, London, has just\r\npublished a pamphlet from which we have condensed some very plain,\r\nshort, simple rules for testing the quality of guano. As the\r\nadulterating substances are generally heavier than the guano, they may\r\nbe detected by a comparison of weight and measure. To do this, get a\r\nsmall glass tube closed at one end, and weigh accurately an ounce of\r\npure guano, put it in the tube and carefully mark the hight it\r\nfills--try several samples--if there is any difference, mark it. Now\r\nweigh an ounce from a sample adulterated with one fourth its bulk of any\r\nor all the preceding list of articles used for that purpose, and you\r\nwill find the difference of bulk between that and the genuine, very\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\n_Test by Burning._--Guano burnt to ashes at a red heat will leave an ash\r\nof a pearly white appearance, not varying in weight from 30 to 35 per\r\ncent. of the quantity burnt. If it is adulterated with marl, sand, clay,\r\n&c., the ash will be about 60 or 65 per cent, of the weight tested, and\r\nbe colored with the iron always present in the adulterating substances,\r\nand which is never found in pure guano. This test, to be accurate, must\r\nbe done with a nice pair of scales and a platinum cup, which may be\r\nheated over a spirit lamp. Ten grains of the guano are placed in the\r\nplatinum cup, which is held by the tongs in the flame of the spirit lamp\r\nfor several minutes, until the greater part of the organic matter is\r\nburnt away. It is allowed to cool for a short time, and a few drops of a\r\nstrong solution of nitrate of ammonia added, to assist in consuming the\r\ncarbon in the residue. The cup is again heated, (taking care to prevent\r\nits boiling over, or losing any of the ash,) until the moisture is quite\r\nevaporated. A full red heat must then be given it, when, if the guano be\r\npure, the ash will be pearly white, and will not exceed 3-1/2 grains in\r\nweight. If adulterated with sand, marl, &c., the ash will always be\r\ncolored, and will weigh more than 3-1/2 grains. Even the simple burning\r\nof a few grains of guano, on a red hot shovel, will often indicate by\r\nthe color whether a fraud has been committed; but we cannot particularly\r\nrecommend this method, as the iron of the shovel itself will sometimes\r\ngive a tinge to the ash. This might be obviated by burning the sample on\r\na common earthen plate.\r\n\r\nIf the adulteration of guano has been made by sand, it can be detected\r\nby dissolving the ashes in muriatic acid. The sand will remain--if it is\r\nmore than one per cent., it has probably been added fraudulently. As\r\niron exists in loam, it will show in the color of the ash if that is the\r\nsubstance used for adulteration. If lime has been added, it can be\r\ndetected by dissolving the ash in muriatic acid and separating the sand,\r\nloam and iron, if present, by filtration, and then adding oxalate of\r\nammonia to the liquid. If it shows more than a mere trace of lime, it\r\nhas been falsified.\r\n\r\n_Test by salt._--Saturate a quart of water and strain it; pour some in a\r\nsaucer and sprinkle guano upon the surface. Good guano sinks\r\nimmediately, leaving only a slight scum. If it has been adulterated by\r\nany light or flocculent matters, they will be seen upon the surface of\r\nthe brine.\r\n\r\n_Test by Acid._--Put a teaspoonful of guano in a wine glass and add a\r\nlittle vinegar or dilute muriatic acid. If ground limestone or chalk\r\nhave been added, the effervessence will show it. A genuine article will\r\nonly show a few bubbles.\r\n\r\n_Test by Water._--The following simple plan will easily detect all the\r\nordinary adulterations of guano. Procure a wide mouthed bottle, with\r\nsolid glass stopper; fill with water and insert the stopper; let the\r\nexterior be well dried. In one pan of accurate scales, place the\r\nbottle; counterpoise by shot, sand or gravel. Pour out two thirds of\r\nthe water, and put in four ounces avoirdupois of guano. Agitate the\r\nbottle, add more water; let it rest a couple of minutes, and fill with\r\nwater, so the froth all escapes; insert the stopper, wipe dry, and\r\nreplace the bottle in the scale. Add now to the counterpoised scale, one\r\nand a half ounces avoirdupois, and a fourpenny piece; if the bottle\r\nprove the heavier, the guano is, in all probability, adulterated. Add in\r\naddition a three-penny piece, and if the bottle is still heaviest the\r\nguano is undoubtedly adulterated. By this simple experiment, a very\r\nsmall amount of sand, marl, &c., is detected.\r\n\r\nIf farmers will not use some of these simple tests, or employ a chemist\r\nto detect suspected adulteration; or if they will buy guano of men who\r\nhave no character to lose, and who offer to sell below a price to afford\r\nthem a living profit, they cannot be pitied if they are cheated.\r\n\r\n_Prepared Guano._--Never buy anything bearing that name, unless you wish\r\nto verify the adage of \"the fool and his money are soon parted.\"\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Prepared Guano._--We give an analysis of one sample of\r\ndomestic manufacture, and two British. No. 1. was offered in London and\r\nactually sold as Peruvian guano, to farmers in the south of England;\r\njust because they were so neglectful of their own interests as not to\r\ninform themselves that an article sold for $35 a ton, could not be\r\ngenuine, while the regular government price remained fixed at $47. It\r\nmay readily be seen by the analysis, how they were cheated into paying\r\nthat price for an article of which 74 per cent. is plaster, and only\r\nhalf of one per cent. ammonia.\r\n\r\n  No. 1. Gypsum,      74.05\r\n\r\n  Phosphate of lime,  14.05\r\n\r\n  Sand,                2.64\r\n\r\n  Moisture and loss,   9.26\r\n                     ------\r\n                     100.00\r\n                     ------\r\n  Ammonia,             0.51\r\n\r\nThe other sample is still worse. This was sold as Saldana Bay guano, at\r\n$15 to $20 a ton. It was composed of\r\n\r\n  Sand,               48.81\r\n\r\n  Phosphate of lime,  10.21\r\n\r\n  Gypsum,              5.81\r\n\r\n  Chalk,              22.73\r\n\r\n  Moisture,           12.44\r\n                     ------\r\n                     100.00\r\n                     ------\r\n  Ammonia,          a trace\r\n\r\nIt would have been dear at half the price. But why? perhaps you inquire,\r\ndo you give these samples of rascality in England? Just to show you what\r\nmen are capable of doing there, they will probably do here--nay, have\r\ndone. Here is the analysis of an article which was sold in the city of\r\nNew York, under the name of _prepared guano_. The analysis was made by\r\nthe lately deceased, highly respected, and eminent analytic chemist,\r\nProfessor Norton, of Yale College, showing the following result.\r\n\r\n  Water,                          4.35\r\n\r\n  Alumina and phosphate of lime,  7.82\r\n\r\n  Organic matter,                32.58\r\n\r\n  Insoluble matter,              26.05\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of lime,             28.76\r\n\r\n  Magnesia, alkalies, and loss,   0.43\r\n                                 ------\r\n                                100.00\r\n\r\nThis analysis was made by the request of the editor of the Genesee\r\nFarmer, by whom it is not only endorsed, but proof given of its utter\r\nworthlessness upon the land where it was applied. Professor Norton made\r\nthe following remarks upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\"This is indeed a _prepared_ article. You will observe that three tenths\r\nof the whole are water, or matter insoluble in acid, or nothing more\r\nthan water and sand. More than another three tenths is organic matter;\r\nthis contains scarcely a trace of ammonia or nitrogen in any form, being\r\nworth no more than common muck from a swamp. Thus we have six tenths of\r\nthe guano made up of a mixture that as a gift, would not be worth\r\ncarting. Nearly another three tenths is carbonate of lime, a valuable\r\narticle it is true, but one which can be bought far more cheaply by the\r\nbarrel, bushel or ton, than as guano. The remaining tenth contains a\r\nsmall quantity of phosphates, but not enough to make the mixture of much\r\nvalue. The parties engaged in this manufacture, should be widely\r\nexposed, for it is one of the most outrageous impositions I have ever\r\nknown. Farmers should avoid everything of this nature unless it is\r\ncertified to be equal to a copy of analysis shown. This stuff is not\r\nworth transporting any distance for your land. J. P. NORTON.\"\r\n\r\nWe will now give the analysis of Peruvian, Patagonian, and Chilian\r\nguano, as determined by Dr. Anderson, chemist of the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety of Scotland, to be a fair average deduced, from a careful\r\nexamination of many samples. The same results have been obtained in this\r\ncountry by such eminent chemists as Professor Norton, Dr. Antisell, and\r\nDr. Higgins. We only give analysis of these three kinds, for the reason,\r\nno other of any consequence is now offered for sale in this country.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF GUANO.\r\n\r\n                     Peruvian.   Chilian    Chilian   Patagonian\r\n                                  Fine.

As the principal value of\r\nguano consists of the ammonia and phosphates, it is easily calculated.\r\n\r\n  17 per cent. of ammonia is equal to 340 lbs. in\r\n  a ton of 2,000 at 12-1/2 cents,                        $42.50\r\n\r\n  23.48 per cent. of phosphates is equal to 470 lbs.\r\n  in a ton at 1-1/2 cents,                                 7.05\r\n\r\n  Alkaline salts,                                          5.00\r\n                                                         ______\r\n  Value of a ton of Peruvian guano,                      $54.55\r\n\r\nTo this may be added the advantage of having these valuable substances\r\nin the best possible condition, so finely pulverized they are ready\r\nprepared for the use of plants.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken as an incontrovertible fact then, that guano is a cheap\r\nand good manure for any land and any crop which would be benefitted by\r\nthe best quality of farm yard manure and ground bones. It is most\r\nbeneficial on poor sandy loam, absolutely unproductive; and most\r\nprofitable when applied to any land which cannot be otherwise manured on\r\naccount of distance and transportation of grosser articles. The better\r\nthe land is kept in tilth, the better will be the effect of an\r\napplication of guano. The public may also be assured of another fact; if\r\nthe guano is bought direct from the agents of the Peruvian government in\r\nthis country, or of reliable merchants, who get their supplies direct\r\nfrom them, it will be of a uniform quality and value, as indicated by\r\nthe analysis just given.\r\n\r\nThey may also rest assured, and the author of this pamphlet believes his\r\nreputation will warrant the assertion and belief, that he could not be\r\nhired to puff an unworthy article, or write a book to induce American\r\nfarmers, to purchase an article which would not prove highly beneficial\r\nto their best interests.\r\n\r\nThe author does know that the introduction of guano into this country is\r\na blessing to the nation. Its general use will not only increase the\r\nwealth of individuals, but that of the body politic. Let us illustrate\r\nthis point by a statement of an English writer of its advantages to that\r\ncountry. He says--\"The importance of this question may be easily\r\nillustrated. We grow in this country about 4,000,000 acres of wheat\r\nannually. An application of two hundred weight of guano to each acre\r\nwould increase the produce by six bushels, or raise the average of\r\nEngland from 26 to 32 bushels an acre, giving a total increase to our\r\nhome produce of 3,000,000 quarters of wheat, which is of itself\r\nequivalent to a larger sum than the whole diminution of rent stated by\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to have been occasioned by free trade in\r\ncorn. But this is only one use to which guano would be applied, for its\r\neffects are even more valuable to green crops than to corn.\"\r\n\r\nThe proportionate advantage to this country would be almost\r\ninconceivably greater as our average product is far less, and the\r\nincreased number of bushels per acre, far more; the produce of land as\r\nstated by Mr. Newton and others, having been raised from 3 to 15 or 20\r\nbushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThe estimation in which it is held by some of the best farmers in the\r\nworld may be judged by the increased demand in England.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of Peruvian guano annually imported has risen from 22,000\r\ntons in 1846 to 95,000 tons in 1850, but has increased during the last\r\nyear to about 200,000 tons. If the price were reduced by £2 to £3 a ton,\r\neven the present large supply would be found greatly short of the\r\nincreased demand. In a single season, in 1845, when the price of Ichaboe\r\nguano ranged from 6£ to 7£ a-ton, the importation with an open trade\r\nrose to 220,000 tons. A reduction of 2£ to 3£ a ton would be followed by\r\nan extraordinarily increased consumption. Twice the present importation\r\nmight be taken advantageously for the wheat crops alone. It seems to be\r\nheld by the Government that the right of Peru to the Lobos Islands is\r\nunquestionable. It is, in that case, only by friendly negotiation that\r\nanything can be done. Considerations should be pressed on the present\r\nMinistry, pledged as they are to promote the landed and shipping\r\ninterests. If they can persuade the Peruvian Government, by friendly\r\nnegotiation, that the interests of that country as well as ours will be\r\nbenefited by opening the guano trade, they will confer an important\r\nservice on this country; a full supply would contribute materially to\r\nrestore the prosperity of the landed interest by increasing their\r\nproduce at diminished cost; and it would give regular employment to\r\nabout one-tenth of the whole mercantile navy of England.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly! an increased supply, or rather an increased consumption,\r\nwould tend materially to restore, in England and in America, to build up\r\nthe landed interest, by increasing the product of the land at diminished\r\ncost. If farmers could buy guano at lower prices, it is argued all would\r\nuse it. Undoubtedly again! Because their profits would be greater. So\r\ngreat in fact, the temptation to make money out of the purchase and use\r\nof guano few could withstand \"such a chance for a speculation.\"\r\n\r\nBut as they cannot induce the Peruvians to let them have it at a lower\r\nprice, and as they can make money out of it at the present price, is it\r\nnot a suicidical measure upon the part of the owners of unprofitable\r\nland, to refuse to use guano, because they cannot get it at their own\r\nprice, while they can certainly profit by its use at present prices.\r\n\r\n_The Guano Monopoly._--Much prejudice has been excited against the\r\nagents and principal dealers in this country by the cry of monopoly. Are\r\nthose who cry _wolf_ the loudest, entirely clear themselves, of a\r\nfondness for fat mutton? The following extract from a letter of Edward\r\nStabler of Maryland, gives a more fair, impartial view of the subject.\r\nHe says; \"Odious and grinding as monopolies usually become, and hard as\r\nthis one seems to bear upon the agriculturist's interests, it still\r\nappears to be about as fair as ordinary mercantile transactions. The\r\nPeruvians may be considered the producers, and like our farmers and\r\nplanters, may at times require advances from the commission merchant;\r\nand in proportion to the prices obtained, are his profits increased; nor\r\ndoes any one censure the merchant for selling at the highest price he\r\ncan. Dealers, or speculators, if you please, are always censured for\r\nraising the price of guano. Is not the same thing done every day, and\r\nevery hour in the day, by the purchase and sale of flour, wheat, corn,\r\nand tobacco--and is not the price of almost every article of commerce\r\nregulated in a great degree by the supply and demand? Most certainly;\r\nand so long as there is a probability of profit by the purchase and sale\r\nof this article, and just so long, and no longer, will the 'trade in\r\nsecond hands' continue. If the present supply is inadequate to the\r\ndemand, by an almost undeviating rule in commerce, the price is\r\nenhanced, until at a point to drive the consumer from the market. This\r\nhowever, is not quite so soon attained with guano, under the present\r\nexcitement, as with many other things. I have viewed this matter in a\r\ndifferent light from some others, though erroneous as some may suppose,\r\nand do not think that censuring the dealers will cover the true ground\r\nof complaint, or at all tend to remove the existing difficulty. Their\r\nagency is, if I may use the term--but in no offensive sense--a kind of\r\nnecessary evil; for the importer will not retail, and it suits but few\r\nof the consumers comparatively, to club together, and purchase in large\r\nquantities. The price of guano is owing mainly, if not entirely, to this\r\nmonopoly in the import trade; and it would be the same thing, and a\r\nmonopoly still, whether in the hands of English or American merchants;\r\nwith also, about the same amount of liberality to be looked for, from\r\none as from the other.\"\r\n\r\nIs there anything so unfair in this, that we should cry out \"wicked\r\nmonopoly.\" The Peruvian government, after the revolution, finds itself\r\ndeeply in debt, and greatly in want of money, and in possession of one\r\nof the most valuable fertilizing substances in the world, which the\r\npeople of other governments are in want of, or rather, may profit by the\r\nuse of, which she offers to sell at what she deems a fair price; and for\r\nthe purpose of enabling her to borrow money for immediate necessities,\r\nas well as to pay the war debt, she has given some of her citizens--rich\r\nmerchants, who can advance money, certain privileges and advantages in\r\nthe guano trade, upon condition that they will send a supply to all the\r\ncountries where it can be sold, and in as great quantities as they will\r\nbuy at fixed prices. This is the monopoly. A parallel case can be found\r\nnearer home. The government of the United States, also incurred a\r\nrevolutionary war debt, and also came in possession of an article which\r\nthe people of all other countries want, and unlike that possessed by\r\nPeru, an article which they must have. Upon this necessity of life, our\r\ngovernment has fixed a price, which any one may pay or let it alone--buy\r\nor not, just as he pleases. The government will neither sell to citizens\r\nor strangers at half price, nor let them have the use of it without pay;\r\nin fact, will not let us carry away anything of value from this\r\nproperty, although it might not materially injure the sale of the\r\nprincipal and most valuable portion, which is immovable. Such is the\r\n\"guano monopoly\" of one government, and such is the \"land monopoly\" of\r\nthe other. Which is most wicked?\r\n\r\nOf the right of each government, no honest man will dispute. That Peru\r\nhas as much right to the guano upon her desert islands, as the United\r\nStates has to the live oak timber in the deserts of Florida; or as\r\nEngland has to the codfish in the waters of Newfoundland, seems to be as\r\nclear as any right ever exercised by any power on earth. Each protect\r\ntheir own by hired agents, so far as they are able, to prevent dishonest\r\nmen from carrying away that which each considers valuable.\r\n\r\nIf English and United States citizens have a right to go and seize upon\r\nthe guano and bring it off in defiance of Peru, because the guano\r\nislands are not inhabited, then have we a right to seize all the codfish\r\nin the waters of the sea, because nobody lives there--they cannot live\r\nthere--they only live on the lands adjacent, and therefore have no\r\nright to anything except what they stand upon. Then by the same rule\r\nmay the lands of the United States be seized upon, because they are\r\nunoccupied.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of decrees now in force, no vessel, either under the national\r\nor any foreign flag, has a right to go to the Peruvian guano deposits,\r\nwithout first obtaining permission from the Peruvian Government under\r\npenalty of confiscation.\r\n\r\nForeign vessels, furnished with government licences, are allowed to load\r\nat the Chinche Islands only.\r\n\r\nFinally, any attempt to load vessels without the proper licences, would\r\nsubject them to be seized by the Government vessels appointed to cruise\r\noff, and visit the different guano deposits, in order to prevent not\r\nonly the illegal extraction of guano by foreign trading vessels, but\r\nalso to prevent the natives of Peru from violating the Government orders\r\nagainst visiting those localities, and destroying or disturbing the\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this cuts off the free trade in the article, it goes to\r\nshow what we have always endeavored to impress upon the minds of\r\nAmerican farmers, that the supply is inexhaustible--at least in this age\r\nand generation--and as every one grows wiser and wiser, it is probable\r\nthe next will have no occasion to use such an old fashioned article as\r\nbird dung for manure. During the present, however, our advice is to\r\nevery person occupying land which needs something to improve its\r\nfertility, to use guano--genuine Peruvian guano--purchased of reliable\r\nmerchants--and the fewer the better between the importer and consumer.\r\n\r\n_The Quantity inexhaustible._--By those surveys, the quantity was\r\nascertained to be upwards of TWENTY MILLIONS OF TONS. As this must\r\nappear so enormous as to be almost incredible, we present the annexed\r\ncut, supposed to represent a vertical section of one of the Chincha\r\nislands and the depth of the deposit according to the government\r\nsurveys. The paralel lines at the bottom represent the level of the\r\nwater--the crooked line above, the surface of the rock; its position\r\nhaving been ascertained by boring and observations of the surveyors. The\r\nrounded line is the surface of the island as it now appears; all between\r\nthat and the rock being guano. The almost perpendicular line at the left\r\nhand, 100 feet high, is the rock at which ships lay to take in cargo.\r\nThe space under the dotted line show a comparison of the quantity taken\r\naway, as it relates to the whole upon the island. The well hole\r\nrepresented in that section was dug some fifty feet deep to prove the\r\nguano was of equal quality at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe Chincha Islands are three in number; not remote from each other or\r\ndiffering very materially in size or general feature. The Geological\r\nformation presents the appearance of masses of rock jutting out above\r\nthe surface of the ocean--and occasionally rising nearly perpendicularly\r\nto a height of from 50 to 100 feet. At a distance, the islands present\r\nto the eye a somewhat conical form; owing probably to the greater\r\ndeposits of guano in the centre; and all appear equally rich in quantity\r\nand quality.\r\n\r\nThe \"North Island\" is estimated to be about 300 feet at its greatest\r\nelevation; it is about 1-1/2 miles in length, and from 1/2 to 3/4 of a\r\nmile average width. In sailing round them, the guano appears to many\r\nplaces to extend to the water's edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTIONAL VIEW OF THE NORTH CHINCHA ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nAll the guano islands are uninhabited, except by the laborers, mostly\r\nIndians or poor Chinamen, who are employed in the work of digging,\r\ncarrying and loading the guano into the ships. When a vessel is ready to\r\ntake in cargo, she is moored alongside of the rocks almost mast head\r\nhigh, from the top of which the guano is sent down through a canvass\r\nshute directly into the hold of the ship. Thus several hundred tons can\r\nbe put on board in a day. The trimming of the cargo is a very unpleasant\r\npart of the labor. The dust and odor is almost overpowering; so the men\r\nare obliged to come often on deck for fresh air. The rule is to remain\r\nbelow as long as a candle will burn; when that goes out, the air is\r\nconsidered unfit for respiration. If the labor had to be performed by a\r\nYankee, he would think it unfit at first; and thereupon set his ready\r\nwit at work to construct a machine to spread the guano as it fell, from\r\none end of the hold to the other. The guano in position upon the island,\r\nis so compact it has to be dug up with picks. It is then carried to a\r\ncontrivance made of cane, at the edge of the rock, which conveys it into\r\nthe canvass conductors. The mass is cut down in steps, receding and\r\nrising from the point of commencement, and has not yet attained a depth\r\nof 100 feet, and with all the labor of hundreds of men digging, and\r\nnumerous ships carrying away to the several countries using it, there is\r\nbut a bare beginning of removal made upon the mass upon one island only,\r\nas may be seen by reference to the diagram.\r\n\r\nSupposing like many others, the supply of Peruvian guano was like the\r\nIchaboe, destined to run out--that is all be dug up and carried away; we\r\ninquired of an intelligent captain of a ship just returned with a load,\r\nhow long it would be before the supply would be exhausted. \"Exhausted!\"\r\nsaid he, with a look over the gangway, as much as to say how long would\r\nit take to exhaust the ocean with a pint cup; \"why not in one hundred\r\nyears, if every ship afloat should go into the trade, and load and\r\nunload as fast as it would be possible to perform the labor; no, not\r\nfrom the Chincha islands alone. Exhausted! they never will be\r\nexhausted.\" With due allowance for the captain's enthusiasm, we may be\r\nvery certain from the government surveys, the quantity is so great, that\r\nno probability exists of the supply being exhausted until all the\r\npresent inhabitants of this earth have ceased to move upon its surface.\r\nWe may be certain of another fact; that unless we commit a great\r\nnational wrong upon Peru, by seizing upon some of her guano territory; a\r\nthing which the sober second thought of this nation will never sanction;\r\nwe shall not be able to obtain the article only through her government\r\nagents, at such prices as her rulers think proper to affix to it. While\r\nthe demand and the result of the use of guano continues as at present,\r\nthere is not much probability of any material change.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian Government are, of course, anxious to sell all that the\r\nworld want, and are willing to pay for at remunerating prices. The\r\nPeruvian minister, in reply to the Secretary of State at Washington\r\nsays:--\"The Peruvian Government, in leasing out its rights and\r\ninterests, as a proprietor of the article, adopted the only system that\r\nwas supposed likely to create a demand for guano; while, on the other\r\nside, it was bound to leave the consignment as security, in the hands of\r\nthose persons who had hazarded their capital in meeting the heavy\r\nexpenses attending the process of freighting, and in making the advances\r\nwhich were required to facilitate the exportation and construct the\r\ndepots. Far from establishing a selfish monopoly, which would have\r\nproved injurious to its own interests, or fix a high, deliberate, and\r\nconventional price upon the article, it has only aimed to secure a net\r\nprofit, reduced to the lowest possible standard, exceeding very little\r\nthe actual amount of expenses; and there have been accounts of sales\r\nrendered exhibiting both loss and damage.\r\n\r\n\"The guano, therefore, is not monopolized; the government as the\r\nproprietor, has forwarded it, on its own responsibility, to those\r\nmarkets where it was in demand; selecting as consignees, as it was\r\nnatural and proper it should do, those persons or houses who have\r\nadvanced the capital necessary to defray the expenses; and, as these are\r\nmuch greater in all cases of remittances to England, and it follows that\r\nthe sale of the article in this country is at the rate of ten pounds\r\nsterling per ton, the net profit has been less than what is realized in\r\nthe United States, where the farmers obtain it at lesser prices. Nor has\r\nmy government imposed any restrictions, duties, or determinate value on\r\nthe exportation of guano, although it might and could do so with perfect\r\npropriety; because such action would have militated to the detriment of\r\nits own interests as the proprietor of the article. Its object has been\r\nto send it to those markets where it was in demand; because, as it had\r\nnot yet become an object of decided and positive interest to the\r\nconsuming world, and there being no certainty of its attaining saleable\r\nprices, to create a market as it was impossible for individuals to send\r\nto Peru for supplies, with any prospect of even moderate profit.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a fair statement of the case; and ought to be perfectly\r\nsatisfactory to the consumers. The disposition of some men to create\r\nprejudice against the government of Peru, or the agents who sell guano\r\nin this country, because the price is too high, is a wicked one. Men can\r\nmake money by purchasing at the present prices; and the owners of the\r\narticle think they cannot make it by selling at a lower price. We have\r\nheard it urged as a reason why it should be sold at lower prices, that\r\nthe agents and merchants engaged in its sale are making fortunes. So are\r\nflour merchants--so are farmers who grow the wheat--but that is no\r\nreason why it should be sold lower.\r\n\r\nWith all our heart, we wish the Peruvians would give us guano at half\r\nprice; but because they will not, there is no reason why the people of\r\nthis country should refuse to use an article which will most assuredly\r\nmake them grow rich faster than those who are engaged in selling it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS GUANO?--ITS HISTORY AND LOCALITY.--AMOUNT AND VALUE.\r\n\r\nGuano is the concentrated essence of fish-eating birds excrements. It,\r\nis found in the condition of a dry powder, of a brownish yellow color,\r\nnot unlike in appearance to Scotch snuff; with a pungent strong smell of\r\nammonia, distinguishing it from any other substance. It is found in\r\nvarious parts of the world, upon desert headlands and islands of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans, where the birds have had undisputed\r\npossession for countless ages of time. The island of Ichaboe, on the\r\nCoast of Africa, furnished a good many cargoes, a few years since, most\r\nof which were taken to England; a small supply was imported into the\r\nUnited States, and sold and known as African guano. The quality was fair\r\nThe deposit upon that island is quite exhausted--in fact it was all\r\ncarried away within a few months after it became generally known--some\r\nof the last cargoes being of little more value than rich earth. It is\r\nsaid that a new deposit, which is nothing more than dry bird dung, has\r\nalready been gathered and taken to England. No doubt cargoes of similar\r\nmanure might gathered from the Florida keys; and although it would be a\r\nvaluable manure, it is not guano--that is formed by the chemical action\r\nof a dry atmosphere, during time's long ages.\r\n\r\n_Anagamos Guano._--This is also of a character similar to \"new Ichaboe.\"\r\nIt is rich in ammonia, but contains no lime or sulphuric acid, and less\r\nphosphates and alkaline substances than Peruvian, and more sand. The\r\nsupply of this must be very limited, as it is a recent deposit and has\r\nto be gathered by hand from the rocks.\r\n\r\n_Bolivian Guano._--This as its name indicates, is from the coast of\r\nBolivia, on the west side of South America. It was thought at one time\r\nto be fully equal in value to Peruvian, but some subsequent importations\r\nof almost worthless cargoes, have proved the deposit to be very variable\r\nin quality, or else purposely adulterated, which has had the effect to\r\ndestroy confidence in all bearing that name. The belief of the writer\r\nis, that it was not adulterated, but owing to the fact that it is found\r\nin a latitude where it does sometimes rain, or where it is liable to be\r\ndrenched by sea spray, that portions of it are injured in that way; so\r\nthat a ship may have one portion of her cargo of the best kind, while\r\nthe remainder is hardly worth the freight. The deposit is not large.\r\n\r\n_Chilian Guano._--The most of that imported into this country under this\r\nname, has been of a very inferior quality, and having been recommended\r\nby those interested in its sale, as having come from the same coast as\r\nthat of Peru, and of equal value, and proving almost worthless, has\r\ndeterred many from making another trial. Although there is a small\r\nsupply of Chilian Guano, which is gathered from the rocks in pale yellow\r\nmasses, some of which has been sent to England and this country, which\r\nis equal to any ever discovered in any part of the world, yet the great\r\nbulk of the deposit is so inferior that Chilian guano will never meet\r\nwith universal favor. In fact, some of the stuff which has been sold\r\nunder that name, is unworthy to be called guano.\r\n\r\n_Patagonian Guano._--Of this kind, larger quantities have been imported\r\nthan any other beside Peruvian; and it has generally been sold at higher\r\nprices than its value as a fertilizer would warrant. Owing to the fact\r\nof its being deposited in a latitude of sunshine and showers, both of\r\nthe utmost intensity; it never comprises the valuable qualities always\r\nfound in that where rain never was known to fall. Besides the\r\ndeterioration of the elements, samples of some cargoes of this guano\r\nhave been found to contain upwards of 30 per cent of sand--in one case\r\n38 per cent. It is said, however, that some of the deposits contain\r\nconsiderable quantities of crystalized salts of ammonia, magnesian\r\nphosphates, rich in ammonia, but which have been rejected by masters of\r\nvessels taking in cargoes, under the supposition of its being sea salt\r\nand calculated to injure the sale and value of the guano. It is believed\r\nthat there is a a larger supply of this than any other guano, except\r\nPeruvian, but as no certain reliance can be placed upon its quality or\r\nvalue, it never will be extensively imported into the United States.\r\n\r\n_Saldana Bay Guano._--Considerable quantities of guano under this name\r\nhave been taken to England, and upon land and crops requiring phosphates\r\nmore than ammonia, has been pronounced a superior article. But the fact\r\nis, it is found in a climate similar to the Patagonian, and,\r\nconsequently, like that, must have a great portion of its ammonia washed\r\nout, leaving almost its only value as fertilizer, in its phosphates;\r\nwhich undoubtedly exist in large proportions, but not as cheap as may be\r\nprocured from other sources. The foregoing comprises all the kinds of\r\nguano known in commerce, except the Peruvian, to which we shall devote\r\nan entire chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERUVIAN GUANO--ITS LOCATION--OWNERSHIP--QUANTITY--VALUE--HOW PROCURED.\r\n\r\nThis is not only the most valuable, but is found in the largest\r\nquantities of any other guano known. That which has been sent to this\r\ncountry and England, in such quantities within the last ten years, was\r\ntaken from the Chincha Islands, which are situated between latitude 13°\r\nand 14°, and at about twelve miles from the coast of Peru, in the bay of\r\nPisco. The great value of the Peruvian guano, arises from the fact,\r\n_that rain never falls upon the islands where guano is found_. The air\r\nis always dry, and the sun shines with intense power, sufficient to\r\nevaporate all the juices from flesh, so that meat can be preserved sweet\r\nwithout salt. The waters surrounding these islands may be said to be\r\nliterally alive, so full are they of fish. Almost as numerous as the\r\nfish, are the birds which satisfy their voracious appetites upon this\r\nfinny multitude, until they can gorge no more, when they retire to the\r\nislands to deposit their excrement, composed of the oily flesh and bones\r\nof their only food, until the mass which has been accumulating for\r\nthousands of years, is so great as almost to exceed human belief.\r\n\r\nHumbolt, in his history of South America, states, some of these deposits\r\nare 50 or 60 feet thick. Many have thought this the \"romance of\r\nhistory,\" but the actual surveys made by the Peruvian government five or\r\nsix years ago, have proved that the guano in many places is more than\r\ntwice that depth; and as there is good reason to believe, and as may be\r\nseen by the diagram on page 79, it is probably 300 feet thick in some of\r\nthe depressions of the natural surface. And this has been accumulated by\r\nan annual aggregation, so slow as to be scarcely visible from year to\r\nyear, until the quantity now exceeds 20,000,000 of tons.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the Chincha islands are three in number; the Lobos\r\nislands two; these are situated off the north part of the coast of\r\nPeru.\r\n\r\nIf the right of Peru to the guano is to be disputed, let it be done by\r\nnational vessels and not by armed privateers. If farmers are convinced\r\nthat we have made true statements of the value of guano in renovating\r\nthe poor and worn out fields of America, let them purchase at once. The\r\nonly question to ask is not whether we can go to the Lobos Islands to\r\nget guano--nor whether it would be better to buy it of government\r\nagents, or speculators on private account, but\r\n\r\n\r\nDOES GUANO PAY?\r\n\r\nBecause, if it does pay, that is, if the farmer can buy guano at present\r\nprices, and realise an increase of crops more than enough to pay the\r\nexpense, it does pay. We think we have shown this fact by\r\nincontrovertible evidence. If the first crop pays for the guano and no\r\nmore, the farmer has a certain profit in the improved condition of the\r\nland. If the first crop does not pay, the land will be enough better to\r\npay cost. Upon this point, Mr. Mechi, of England, whose name has become\r\nworld wide known as an improver of the soil, says; \"Whether guano will\r\npay, depends upon the condition of the soil. On poor exhausted soil it\r\nis a ready and cheap mode of restoring fertility. I used it extensively\r\nwhen I first began farming, and when applied to the grain crops at the\r\nrate of two to three cwt. per acre, it paid well; but now it has lost\r\nfavor with my bailiff, which is easily accounted for; my land being at\r\npresent so well filled with manure, nitrogen or ammonia, that we can\r\ngrow ample crops without it. When the land only yielded two to two and a\r\nhalf quarters of wheat per acre, it was grateful for guano; but now,\r\nwith a produce of five quarters, there is no necessity for its use. Or\r\nrather, the increased supply of farm manure supplies that necessity.\"\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what we have aimed to impress upon our readers; that it\r\nwill pay in the crop to which it is applied--it will more than pay in\r\nthe soil, because it will bring it into a condition of permanent\r\nfertility. It will pay best upon the poorest soil; because that which\r\nwas absolutely barren, becomes fruitful as soon as dressed with guano.\r\nIt will always pay whenever and wherever applied to any soil in a fit\r\ncondition to be benefitted by manure. It will make not only the soil\r\nrich, but whoever uses it to any considerable extent. It will pay best\r\nwhen used in the condition in which you buy it, with no additional labor\r\nor expense except breaking the lumps. If it is sown broadcast, not to\r\nexceed 400 lbs. per acre, and plowed in so deep it will not be disturbed\r\nby any subsequent cultivation of the crop to which it is applied, it\r\nwill most certainly pay in that crop or the succeeding one. It will pay\r\nupon all plants to which it has ever been applied. Notwithstanding it\r\nwill pay best _in_ the soil, it will pay well _on_ it as a top\r\ndressing, if combined with absorbents of ammonia as directed in these\r\npages.[2] That it has paid in ninety nine cases out of every hundred\r\nwhere it has been used, the author is well convinced, and equally well\r\nconvinced that many may profit by reading what he has here said upon the\r\nsubject, and with that feeling, these pages are commended to all the\r\ncultivators of American soil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Upon this point, see Mr. Burgwyn's letter in the appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS WITH GUANO ON LONG ISLAND.\r\n\r\nSince the body of this work was in type, the following letters have been\r\nplaced in our hands.

I., Sept. 13, 1852._\r\n\r\n     MR. THEO. RILEY, ESQ., Dear Sir:--In reply to your inquiry\r\n     relative to the use of Peruvian guano on Long Island, I would say,\r\n     forming my opinion from experience and observation that the mode of\r\n     tillage--the rotation of crops, and the way of applying guano--are\r\n     about as follows: Commence with corn, which is usually on green\r\n     sward, after being mowed and pastured from four to six years.\r\n     First, plow in the spring as soon as the frost is out of the\r\n     ground, which is generally about the 20th of March. Prepare the\r\n     ground for planting the 1st of May, by harrowing well two or three\r\n     times. Before the last time harrowing, apply about 250 or 300 lbs.\r\n     of guano to the acre, sown broadcast, and then mark out with plow,\r\n     or lace, about four and a half feet apart, each way; apply a small\r\n     quantity to the hill, one third of a gill is as much as will be\r\n     safe, and that should be in the form of a ring about a foot in\r\n     diameter, and the corn dropped in the center, otherwise it will be\r\n     likely to kill the corn by the sprouts coming in contact with the\r\n     guano when they first start. It will not do to put the guano in the\r\n     hill and plant the corn upon it. It was not uncommon for farmers to\r\n     have to plant their corn all over before they become acquainted\r\n     with its effects; but as using it in the hill, in a pure state, is\r\n     generally attended with some risk, it is the practice in this\r\n     vicinity to use yard manure, at the rate of one third or half a\r\n     shovelful to the hill; but as that manure is generally weak, they\r\n     have adopted the very excellent plan of sprinkling say 50 lbs. of\r\n     guano to a wagon load (30 bushels) of manure. As we cart the manure\r\n     in the fall to the field where it is intended to be used the\r\n     following spring, (1) the guano can be mixed through it with but\r\n     little trouble, when it is turned and broken up just before use. It\r\n     adds very much to the value of the manure, as the difference of\r\n     harvesting plainly shows. Muck or pond dirt could be used in the\r\n     same way, in place of manure. Some apply it about the hill at the\r\n     time of hoeing. It should not be thrown on top, but sprinkled\r\n     around the corn at the rate of half a gill per hill. After corn, we\r\n     sow oats, or barley, or plants potatoes; if oats, plow once, sow\r\n     150 or 200 lbs. of guano, and two bushels of oats to the acre, and\r\n     harrow in together. It pays well to use guano for oats, as the crop\r\n     of oats will be doubled on ordinary lands; 50 and 60 bushels is\r\n     frequently obtained, and the difference in the straw, is worth the\r\n     expense of the guano.[2] Barley is not much sown; it would require\r\n     a little more guano, say 50 lbs. additional. Potatoes, (Mercers) we\r\n     plant from middle of March to first of May, after sowing broadcast\r\n     from 400 to 600 lbs. of guano per acre, plowed in and harrowed\r\n     over; then mark out with plow three feet apart, drop in drills\r\n     about a foot apart. Some prefer it in the drills, at the rate of\r\n     what they can grasp in one hand to a pace of two and a half feet;\r\n     it should be sprinkled so too much will not come in contact with\r\n     the seed. After oats or potatoes, sow wheat, about first of\r\n     October; if on oats, plow as soon as the oats are off; when ready\r\n     to sow, apply from 500 to 700 lbs. of guano per acre, cross plow,\r\n     and your ground is ready for the seed. As to the varieties of\r\n     wheat, there are several kinds used; the Mediterranean is the most\r\n     popular at present--one and a half bushels is generally sown to the\r\n     acre, and the land laid down to grass, with timothy and clover.\r\n     Some apply less at time of sowing, and add 100 or 150 lbs. per acre\r\n     in the spring, just as the grass is starting, say first of April.\r\n     If wheat is sown after potatoes, about the same treatment is given,\r\n     except 100 lbs. less guano will answer. Some harrow in guano,\r\n     instead of plowing it under; but experience shows that it is much\r\n     the best to plow it in, as the virtue remains in the ground much\r\n     longer, by being covered deep. Peruvian guano will produce the best\r\n     wheat of anything we can use, even if we should go to double the\r\n     expense with other manures. Crops of 30 and sometimes 40 bushels\r\n     have been obtained to the acre with guano. The average crop of\r\n     wheat on the Island, is not over 18 bushels per acre, and with 700\r\n     lbs. of guano plowed in pretty deep, the land can be mowed about as\r\n     long as from an application of stable manure. But as hay is a most\r\n     important crop, after it has been mowed for two or three years, it\r\n     is considered profitable to top dress with about 150 lbs. per acre;\r\n     this will increase the crop from one ton to two per acre, if a fair\r\n     season, and can be mowed two or three years longer. Rye is sown in\r\n     many instances, in place of wheat; it gets the same treatment,\r\n     except half the quantity of guano is only used. Buckwheat requires\r\n     about 100 lbs. of guano to the acre, more or less, according to the\r\n     state of the land.\r\n\r\n     For ruta baga turnips, there should be 600 lbs. sown to the acre;\r\n     plow twice and harrow well after sown. After you have hoed them\r\n     out, give them a light top dressing of more guano. I have raised at\r\n     the rate of 700 bushels, managed in that way, to the acre. We have\r\n     had one of the most extreme drouths the present season I ever\r\n     remember. Crops on which guano was used, have suffered less, and\r\n     are now yielding better than where stable manure has been used.\r\n     This is quite different from the opinion that some have formed, as\r\n     to guano requiring a wet season. To prepare guano for use, it\r\n     should first be sifted, to separate the lumps, so that they may be\r\n     pulverized, then dampen by sprinkling with water, and mixed through\r\n     with a shovel. This should be done a few days before you wish to\r\n     use it, so as to allow the dampness to strike through uniform. (3)\r\n     I have not had any experience with compost, or using it on garden\r\n     vegetables, or plants, except I know it should be used in\r\n     homeopathic doses, or it will destroy more than it will produce. As\r\n     to the soil, guano answers well anywhere on Long Island, although\r\n     some parts of the Island has a very different soil from others,\r\n     with one exception; that is, it is all hungry for manure. I\r\n     therefore do not know the kind of soil it is most applicable to,\r\n     since it seems to suit all kinds.\r\n\r\n     SETH CHAPMAN.\"\r\n\r\nNOTE 1. This practice of hauling manure to the field in the\r\nfall, is the worst of all the foolish old fashions of farmers. To\r\npreserve the virtue, of manure, it requires housing about as much as\r\nhay. In fact, it is doubtful which would lose virtue fastest, a pile of\r\nhay or a pile of manure, exposed to the storms of winter. It is no\r\nwonder that it becomes necessary to mix guano with it, to replace that\r\nwhich has evaporated during its long exposure to sun and storm.\r\n\r\nNOTE 2. This increase of straw, is seldom taken into account in\r\nspeaking of the advantage of an application of guano; yet, as Mr.\r\nChapman says, it is worth enough in the vicinity of a market, to pay the\r\nwhole expense. It is also valuable in the interior for forage and\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nNOTE 3. This is an error. Guano should not be damped unless\r\nwith water saturated with salt, copperas, or a liberal sprinkle of\r\nplaster over the pile.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM SETH RAVNOR, OF MANORVILLE TO MR.\r\nCHAPMAN.--Successful experiments on grass, oats, corn, wheat and\r\nrye.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_Manorville, Sept._ 8, 1852.\r\n\r\n     S. CHAPMAN, ESQ.--Dear Sir;--I have received your circular\r\n     proposing to gather information from practical farmers of the\r\n     results from the use of guano, and to have the same published for\r\n     general circulation. Conceiving the object to be a very laudable\r\n     one, I will give the result of a few experiments tried with\r\n     Peruvian guano by myself, and others which have come under my\r\n     observation; but in doing so I think it would be of great utility\r\n     to state what kind of soil the guano was applied to. Not being a\r\n     professor of geology, I can only use such terms as are familiar\r\n     with farmers generally. The soils in this vicinity are heavy loam,\r\n     sandy loam, sandy, and occasionally some heavy clayey soils.\r\n\r\n     First, as to the nature of guano. It is generally considered to be\r\n     more of a stimulant than an enricher of the soil, if applied in its\r\n     natural state, and much more durable to be plowed in than to be\r\n     harrowed in; and as far as I have tried it, I have not found it to\r\n     be injurious to soils--or as some call it, 'kill the soil.' In the\r\n     year '49 I applied on the first of April, 176 lbs. per acre on\r\n     sandy loam grass ground--yield, about half a ton more than the acre\r\n     adjoining. Same year applied about 150 lbs. to the acre, on four\r\n     acres of oats, same kind of soil, and the estimated increase was 20\r\n     bushels to the acre. In 1850 plowed under 400 pounds per acre, for\r\n     corn, estimated increase, 15 bushels of ears. The season was rather\r\n     unfavorable for corn. In '51 composted six bushels charcoal dust to\r\n     100 lbs. guano, and plowed under for wheat, at the rate of 500 lbs.\r\n     of guano so composted, to the acre, and top dressed with 100\r\n     bushels of leached ashes--yield, 20 bushels. One of my neighbors\r\n     applied for three years in succession, 100 lbs. harrowed in with\r\n     rye, on two acres light sand--yield, 14 bushels to the acre; 10\r\n     bushels more than the acre adjoining. On the fourth year he sowed\r\n     the same ground without guano--- yield, 4 bushels to the acre. We\r\n     see by this, that the crop used the whole strength of the guano.\r\n     Another neighbor applied one ton to two acres, heavy loam; plowed\r\n     under and sowed with turnips (common Russian)--yield, 1,300\r\n     bushels--estimated increase from the guano, 600 bushels. People in\r\n     this section of the Island are agreed in this--plow under guano for\r\n     durability, and harrow in for present benefit, or present crop. For\r\n     wheat, 500 lbs. plowed in is considered a full dressing per acre.\r\n     The same for corn. For oats, 200 lbs. harrowed in. For buckwheat,\r\n     100 lbs., and 200 for barley. One tablespoonful applied in a hill,\r\n     for corn, is quite enough, and that requires to be put some six\r\n     inches from the seed; otherwise it will kill it. Some have lost\r\n     acres by putting their corn on that little quantity; the only safe\r\n     way to apply in the hill for potatoes, is the same as for corn. I\r\n     have come to the conclusion from what experience I have had with\r\n     the article, that it answers the best purpose to use it for spring\r\n     crops, in the manner above stated, or compost it with charcoal\r\n     dust, or well decomposed pond mud, to absorb and retain the\r\n     ammonia, it being very volatile in its nature.

Increase, seven bushels for each 100 lbs--Thirty\r\nbushels of wheat per acre on an old worn out buckwheat field--Advantage\r\nof guano in drouth--astonishing effects from top dressing grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Cherrywood, Sept. 11th, 1852._\r\n\r\n     MR. SETH CHAPMAN--Dear Sir,--I forward according to\r\n     request, the results of several years use of Peruvian Guano, upon\r\n     my farm at Jerusalem, Long Island.\r\n\r\n     The first decisive benefit from guano that I shall notice, was\r\n     obtained from using it for wheat, as a top-dressing. In 1847,\r\n     October 1st, I took a field containing 6 acres of oat stubble, on\r\n     which I used some manure, all over the field; top-dressed with\r\n     Peruvian guano, at the rate of 300 lbs. per acre, sown (fortunately\r\n     just before a storm,) upon the furrow and harrowed in with the\r\n     wheat. Four acres of the field were sown with the old-fashioned red\r\n     flint wheat, which requires more manure than any other kind among\r\n     us. The rest of the field was sown with a soft white hulled wheat,\r\n     the name of which I do not remember. July 5, 1848.--Harvested said\r\n     field--Red wheat yielded well from straw, 14 sheaves to the\r\n     bushel--white wheat 20 sheaves to the bushel--straw very large and\r\n     thick. Had 164 bushels of wheat, or 41 bushels per acre; and 58\r\n     bushels of white wheat or 29 bushels per acre; without the guano I\r\n     think I could not have obtained much over 20 bushels per\r\n     acre.--1848, Oct. 2. Again sowed wheat upon a six acre lot of oat\r\n     stubble; seed red flint wheat--manured about the same as previous\r\n     year--used 300 lbs. guano per acre, as top-dressing for 4 acres and\r\n     moss bunker fish dirt at the rate of 10,000 per acre upon the two\r\n     acres, sowed upon the furrow, and harrowed in just previous to a\r\n     storm--Harvested the 10th of July 1849. The straw very large, and\r\n     wheat heads long, but grain very much injured by fly or\r\n     weevil--very little difference between fish and guano top-dressing;\r\n     yield 188 shocks--175 bushels; not quite 30 bushels per acre. Same\r\n     ground would not have produced more than 18 to 20 bushels wheat per\r\n     acre without the guano--or some other more expensive manure. 1849.\r\n     Oct. 3. Sowed wheat upon oat stubble field; soil thin and gravelly\r\n     upon part of the field--used some barnyard manure, but not as much\r\n     as previous year. Top-dressed with 300 lbs. guano and 12 bushels\r\n     ground bones per acre--Harvested 12th July 1850--Yield of 5-1/2\r\n     acres 160 shocks; injured some by weevil, and shrunken, but had 145\r\n     bushels or twenty-six bushels per acre. This ground would not have\r\n     yielded fifteen bushels per acre without the guano. But the most\r\n     decisive result was obtained the next year, upon an oat stubble\r\n     field of six acres, a part of which had been cropped, for perhaps\r\n     15 years, nearly alternately with rye and buckwheat; (sometimes a\r\n     crop of each in one year.) The whole field seemed so far exhausted\r\n     that we had failed to get a crop of corn or oats from it after two\r\n     different trials; and I underwent no small share of ridicule from\r\n     my neighbors, while preparing it for wheat. Remarks like the\r\n     following were of daily occurrence--\"Ah! Seaman you will fail this\r\n     time.\" \"You have not got your old highly manured fields to exhaust\r\n     this time by your stimulating stuff!\" \"We shall now see whether\r\n     guano is good for anything--this will be a fair test, because the\r\n     land will not produce anything without it, &c.\" \"You may get about\r\n     12 bushels of wheat per acre; we shall see.\" All agreed however,\r\n     that if wheat did grow, guano should have the credit for it.\r\n\r\n     Well, we prepared the ground in about the usual manner, except\r\n     perhaps plowing a little deeper than in former years. A small\r\n     quantity of manure was plowed under, and a top dressing of ground\r\n     bones given and sowed about the last of September--2 acres with\r\n     Mediterranean and 4 acres with the red flint wheat--but owing to a\r\n     scarcity of the article, could only get about 420 lbs. of guano,\r\n     which was sown across the field upon not quite 3 acres, covering\r\n     some of each kind of wheat; it was sown upon the furrow, and\r\n     harrowed in with the wheat as usual. In 1851, April 11th, top\r\n     dressed the whole field with guano, at about 200 lbs. per acre;\r\n     harvested about the 8th July. The 2 acres of Mediterranean yielded\r\n     61 bushels; flint wheat straw very large, and thick upon the\r\n     ground, but grain much injured by the weevil; yielding an average\r\n     of 23 bushels per acre. I may remark, that where the guano was\r\n     applied in the autumn, the crop was quite one third greater than\r\n     where it only received the spring dressing. The last year I managed\r\n     much in the same way, except that I fell short of manure, and\r\n     depended entirely upon guano and bone upon a part of the field,\r\n     from which part, though I have not yet threshed it, I think I shall\r\n     get 18 to 20 bushels. The rest of the field was very large and\r\n     considered the best between this place and Brooklyn, on a road of\r\n     25 miles in length.\r\n\r\n     My _good luck_(1) at wheat growing is now a conceded point. Now for\r\n     other crops--for corn I have not been very successful; generally\r\n     mixing some guano with earth in the hill at the time of planting\r\n     and getting but few plants to stand; these, however, generally have\r\n     been heavily eared. By mixing previously with charcoal dust I think\r\n     this burning of the seed might be avoided.(2)\r\n\r\n     For buckwheat, I used 120 to 150 lbs. per acre, sown upon the\r\n     furrow and harrowed in with the grain. For barley, 150 to 200 lbs.\r\n     per acre; oats 100 to 120 lbs; turnips, 600 to 700 lbs. plowed\r\n     under a short depth, previously to forming the drill; and I find a\r\n     decided profit in using guano for all the above crops. I have seen\r\n     a field of corn the present season very greatly improved in earing\r\n     by the application of about 150 lbs. of guano, mixed with 5 parts\r\n     charcoal dust, and thrown around the hills a few weeks since during\r\n     a rain storm.\r\n\r\n     I have also used guano and charcoal dust, five parts coal to one of\r\n     guano, in my garden, the past season, and found the beds thus\r\n     dressed stood the extreme drought better than other parts of the\r\n     garden. One more case of my own and I am done. In 1851, I sowed\r\n     about 90 lbs. of guano, on a piece of meadow or mowing ground,\r\n     covering a little more than half an acre, from which the timothy\r\n     and clover was nearly gone; I took 3 lands across the lot, leaving\r\n     about 20 feet between each land. Where the guano was sown, the\r\n     timothy grew large and thick and bore the drought, and yielded\r\n     about one and a half tons per acre; while the rest of the field did\r\n     not produce more than half that amount, and that of an inferior\r\n     quality of grass. The corn upon the same field the present season,\r\n     shows plainly a better yield from the above top-dressing. From\r\n     observation and experience, I would recommend the mixing of guano\r\n     with charcoal dust, equal parts, or five parts coal to one guano,\r\n     It is much more pleasant to handle when thus mixed, being\r\n     completely deodorized and rendered much more enduring as a manure,\r\n     by retaining the ammonia for several years, instead of allowing the\r\n     greater part to pass off the first season, as is the case when\r\n     applied in a crude state, especially as a top dressing.\r\n\r\n     Prepared or decomposed muck if used with guano as a retainer of the\r\n     volatile gases, in all cases where it can be conveniently obtained\r\n     especially in soils where evaporation is so rapid as it is in most\r\n     parts of Long Island, will pay.\r\n\r\n     That like produces like, is a favorite maxim with me--that it is\r\n     necessary to replace the matter, both organic and inorganic, which\r\n     we take from the soil in the form of crops, of various kinds--that\r\n     by supplying the necessary chemical ingredients, we shall be able\r\n     to draw a great proportion of our crops from atmospheric\r\n     agents--that the necessity for using such an immense amount of\r\n     organic matter as we now use in the shape of barn yard and stable\r\n     manure will be partially overcome--that a great saving of expense\r\n     will thereby ensue--that guano is one of the most active agents to\r\n     effect such a result I am fully satisfied, not sufficient perhaps\r\n     of itself, but highly useful even in a crude state--and capable\r\n     when skillfully combined with others, to effect an entire\r\n     revolution in our system of agriculture.\r\n\r\n     If you think the above worth an insertion in the pamphlet you spoke\r\n     of, you are at liberty to insert it--if not, you will please return\r\n     the letter to me, as soon as convenient, and if you think it will\r\n     pass off any better, you may affix the following signature to the\r\n     communication.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD H. SEAMAN, Recording Secretary,\r\n  Queen's Co. Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\n     NOTE 1.--Yes, that is the word--_good luck_--it is all\r\n     good luck. It is astonishing how many farmers there are in this\r\n     country who will stand with their hands in their breeches pockets,\r\n     fumbling idle dollars, while a neighbor expends his for guano, and\r\n     produces a fine crop of wheat upon an old worn out buckwheat field;\r\n     at which they stare in stupid wonder at the good luck of the thing.\r\n\r\n     What a pity it had not been the good luck of such men to have been\r\n     born with common sense enough to profit themselves by their\r\n     neighbors good luck.\r\n\r\n     NOTE 2.--It would be far better to sow the guano broadcast\r\n     and plow it in, or scatter it in drills and turn a light furrow on\r\n     it before planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_Hempstead, Aug.27, 1852._\r\n\r\n     SETH CHAPMAN, ESQ.--Dear Sir:--I believe I was the first\r\n     person in Queens County using guano; having imported some from\r\n     England in the ship Yorkshire, in 1842. This was from the Ichaboe\r\n     Islands. I have since used nearly all the varieties, and consider\r\n     the Peruvian the cheapest and best.\r\n\r\n     In applying guano, I think by making a compost, the greatest\r\n     benefit is derived; say one peck of plaster, one bushel of loam,\r\n     two of saw dust, mixed up a month or six weeks before using. From\r\n     100 to 200 lbs. of guano is enough for a crop of oats or buckwheat.\r\n     I have not found it to succeed with corn or potatoes; probably from\r\n     being accompanied by a dry season. The best wheat I ever raised was\r\n     from using 350 lbs. to the acre, composted. This was on a light\r\n     soil, and returned 31 bushels to the acre, on seven acres, weighing\r\n     62 lbs. The grass was poor after it. As a top dresser, I have used\r\n     200 lbs. per acre, very early in the spring, on half a lot, which\r\n     mowed more than half as much again as the part not dressed. One of\r\n     my neighbors has used 300 lbs. per acre, plowed in for potatoes;\r\n     the yield, good, so far, having just commenced digging.\r\n\r\n     JOHN HAROLD.\"\r\n\r\nWe might give much more evidence of the same kind, to prove that every\r\nbarren acre upon Long Island, might be made productive by a judicious\r\nand profitable application of guano; but if there are any persons, who,\r\nafter reading these pages, are still doubting, we must say they are most\r\nincorrigably determined not to profit by the experience of others. To\r\nsuch it would be useless to say more.\r\n\r\n_Successful Experiment with Guano as a Top Dressing on Wheat, in North\r\nCarolina._--On page 17, we gave some account of the application of guano\r\nby Henry K. Burgwyn, Esq., since which, we have been favored with the\r\nfollowing letter from his brother, T. Pollock Burgwyn, written, as will\r\nbe seen, not for publication, but simply to give the party from whom he\r\npurchased the guano, a detail of his success.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_New York, Sept._ 20, 1852.\r\n\r\n     MESSRS. A. B. ALLEN &. Co.--Dear Sir:--Having promised\r\n     that I would furnish you with the result of my application of the\r\n     21 tons of guano which I purchased of you last winter, I proceed\r\n     now to do so, and give you full liberty to quote my experience in\r\n     favor of the use of that most invaluable manure, to all who are\r\n     anxious to profit by the experience of others without incurring any\r\n     risk of their own. My object, and it should be that of every one\r\n     who has used guano, is to extend the knowledge of its great value\r\n     to any owner of poor soil, like the worn out plantations of North\r\n     Carolina. I applied 20 tons of this guano as a top dressing to a\r\n     field of 200 acres, which had been seeded in wheat under most\r\n     unfavorable circumstances. At the time of application, so\r\n     unpromising was the appearance of the growing wheat, that my\r\n     manager and myself thought it almost a waste of money and labor to\r\n     try this experiment,(1) but as the rest of my crop did not require\r\n     any manure, I resolved to see what would be the effect. I am\r\n     confident the field would not have averaged, without the top\r\n     dressing, seven bushels per acre--it yielded rather over 13\r\n     bushels, besides securing to me a full setting of clover.(2)\r\n\r\n     My mode of application was as follows; to each 200 lbs of guano I\r\n     added two bushels of ashes and a bushel of plaster mixed\r\n     intimately, and then sown broadcast, at the rate of six and a half\r\n     bushels per acre, harrowed in with a light harrow. This application\r\n     was made in March, and the early part of April, and in less than\r\n     three weeks after the application, the wheat had undergone an\r\n     entire change, from a yellow, sickly color, to a dark luxuriant\r\n     green. The application had evidently infused new life and vigor\r\n     into the plants, and as the result proved, very nearly or quite\r\n     doubled its product. So much for the crop of wheat; but what was\r\n     still more valuable to me, in my system of farming, it likewise\r\n     secured for me a full crop of clover, which would certainly have\r\n     failed but for this application. I also applied one ton of this\r\n     guano mixed in the same way, to a small field of oats. I plowed\r\n     this under with a small plow, together with the oats; the result\r\n     was equally gratifying. My chief object in this last experiment,\r\n     was to secure me a small field of clover, near my stables, and in\r\n     this I fully succeeded; which I feel assured I should not have done\r\n     but for the guano. My brother and myself have made various\r\n     experiments of late years, with guano, and concur in the testimony\r\n     of all those who have tested its value, carefully and judiciously,\r\n     in pronouncing it to be the most expeditious renovater of the soil\r\n     within the farmer's reach; and exclusive of the farm yard, the most\r\n     economical of all manures. In proof of my conviction of its value\r\n     to me, I shall this fall give you an order for 20 or 30 tons more.\r\n     I will only add that I consider every wheat grower who would study\r\n     his own interest, will find it by trying similar experiments.\r\n\r\n  T. POLLOCK BURGWYN.\"\r\n\r\nNOTE 1. In a subsequent conversation with Mr. Burgwyn, he\r\nstated a fact which makes this point much stronger. After ordering the\r\nguano, he left home, giving his farm manager orders to apply if to that\r\nparticular piece of wheat as soon as it arrived. Owing to the fact that\r\nthe seed was injured--that the land was in a very unfit condition from\r\npoverty and drouth to produce a crop of wheat, it had assumed such a\r\nmiserable appearance before the arrival of the guano, that the manager\r\nwrote to Mr. B. his opinion of the utter folly of applying anything so\r\nexpensive to a crop already struck with death. Not imagining how very\r\nunpromising was the prospect of success, Mr. B. immediately wrote to him\r\nto go ahead as directed. Before the application was completed he\r\nreturned home, and his first impression was to stop the work at once and\r\ngive up the field as lost; but on examining the effect upon that part\r\nwhere the guano was first applied, he found it had already infused new\r\nvigor into the plants, for they had put off their sickly yellow color,\r\nand taken on a vigorous green; and therefore he decided at once to go\r\non, which as will be seen by the result, was a most valuable decision.\r\n\r\nNOTE 2. From personal knowledge of this very field, we are\r\nconfident it would not have yielded without the guano, one half of seven\r\nbushels. It is a flat surface, clayey loam, and badly affected by winter\r\nrains, and such freezing and thawing as it had during the last severe\r\nwinter. Besides it was a few years since, when it came into the\r\npossession of Mr. Burgwyn, one of those old worn out, skinned-to-death\r\nplaces, so common in that State, which all the deep plowing and good\r\nfarming of that gentleman had not been able to restore, until he luckily\r\nhit upon guano; which notwithstanding the most unfavorable\r\ncircumstances, has given him conclusive proof of its inestimable value.\r\nTo say nothing of the ten bushels of wheat per acre, which we are\r\nconfident he gained, the clover is worth more than the guano cost; and\r\nwithout it, one might almost as soon expect to grow clover upon Coney\r\nIsland beach, as upon that field.\r\n\r\nThis letter contains testimony of inestimable value. It comes from a\r\ngentleman of intelligence and careful observation, who is devoted to his\r\nprofession of a farmer, and who has been one of the most successful\r\nrenovators of worn out plantations in the south, and it comes very\r\nopportunely to give our work an appropriate FINALE.",
