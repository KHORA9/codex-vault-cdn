This area is located a few miles north of\r\nPlymouth, Vermont, and is easily reached via State Route 100A from\r\neither Plymouth or Bridgewater Corners (See index map of Vermont,\r\ngeological map). The excellent camping and recreational facilities\r\ncoupled with the natural scenic beauty of this region provide many\r\nvisitors with an irresistible urge to return, summer after summer, to\r\nthis same spot. This pamphlet is designed for all those who visit\r\nCoolidge Forest Park and especially for those who possess questioning\r\nminds and a general desire to learn more about the world around them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why the present mountains and valleys are where\r\nthey are and how and when they got there? Has the thought passed through\r\nyour mind that the very rocks on which you stand or see nearby have a\r\ndefinite story to tell? The geologist not only wonders about such\r\nthings, but through his training attempts to answer questions of this\r\nnature. His everyday job includes the reconstruction of ancient land and\r\nsea areas through a careful study of the rock record. He looks at the\r\nrock layers as you might the pages of a history book. The professional\r\ngeologist, however, commands many basic geological principles and “tools\r\nof the trade” which permit him to read more accurately the records\r\npreserved in stone.\r\n\r\nFirst, the basic geological principles will be explained and you will be\r\ngiven the proper “tools” for your adventure. Then, you are invited to\r\ntravel back through 550 million years of time to see just why Coolidge\r\nState Forest Park is as it is today and what it was like in the distant\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BASIC PRINCIPLES AND “TOOLS”\r\n\r\n\r\nTo many of you rocks are just “rocks” and very little thought has been\r\ngiven to any history which might be gained from their study. Probably\r\neven fewer of you realize that literally billions of years of Earth\r\nhistory can be derived directly from the rock record. Most geologists\r\nconsider the Earth to be nearly four billion years old with man entering\r\nthe picture a mere million or so years ago. No human was present to\r\nrecord the events of billions of years of changing land and seas,\r\nviolent earth movements or the gradual evolution of life through the\r\nlast 500 million years. The study of rocks and their contained evidence\r\nof past life offers the only clarification for the extremely long past\r\nhistory of the Earth. In order to unravel this past history the\r\ngeologist accepts, with some reservations, three basic principles or\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThe Law of Uniformitarianism provides an extremely important link with\r\nthe past. This law states that the physical and chemical forces which\r\nare attacking or building up the surface of the earth today have\r\noperated in much the same way during past geological time. This means\r\nthat our observations of present day environments, such as streams,\r\ndeltas, lakes and oceans can be applied, after slight modification, to\r\nthe past as recorded in the rocks. For example, study of present day\r\ndeltas, such as the Nile or Mississippi River delta, has led to the\r\ndiscovery of many past deltaic deposits now preserved as layers and\r\nlenses of rock. This distribution pattern of sands and muds, the nature\r\nof the life forms within each environment and many other such criteria\r\naid the geologist in his interpretations.\r\n\r\nThe Law of Superposition provides a physical order to the many layers of\r\nrock which form the geological record. Compare, for the moment, the vast\r\nnumbers of rock layers (strata) with the layers of a layercake. As a\r\nlayercake is built up each individual layer is placed one over another,\r\nwith the bottom or base layer the first to be positioned and followed by\r\nsuccessively overlying layers. If you think of the development of this\r\ncake in terms of time, the base layer is the oldest, the uppermost the\r\nyoungest. The Law of Superposition follows this example and states that\r\nthe lowermost stratum in a sequence of rock strata is the oldest or the\r\nfirst to form, while the stratum above is younger and formed at a later\r\ntime. Some reservations do exist; however, in the Forest Park under\r\nimmediate consideration this general law does apply.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1. Igneous dike cutting the Pinney Hollow\r\n    formation. The dike is the darker rock which trends toward the upper\r\n    left of the photograph. This dike is located approximately 100 yards\r\n    south of the Pinney Hollow Historical Monument and on the east side\r\n    of State Highway 100A.]\r\n\r\nThe third basic principle to command is known as the Law of Faunal\r\nSuccession. In generalized form this law states that each stratum of\r\nrock contains its own distinct group of animal or plant remains, termed\r\nfossils, and that these same remains can be recognized throughout the\r\nworld wherever they occur. Since plants and animals changed through time\r\nand because their remains are found throughout the world, it is possible\r\nto erect a worldwide time scale based upon animal and plant evolution.\r\nIn short, the fossils found in particular rock are characteristic\r\nrepresentatives of the life at the time that rock originated and the\r\nfossils found could have been entombed only at that time. One stratum,\r\ntherefore, would have a total fossil assemblage quite different from the\r\nstratum above or below. Without this time reference chart it would be\r\nimpossible to reconstruct what did happen during any one time interval\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these three basic laws it is necessary to mention the\r\nrudiments of rock classification. The geologist divides _rocks_[1] into\r\nthree major groups which are termed Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic\r\nrocks. Igneous rocks are those formed by the solidification of molten\r\nmaterial. This molten material was thrust into the outer crust of the\r\nearth from below and after cooling became a solid igneous rock such as\r\ngranite, or in other cases it flowed out over the surface of the earth\r\nin the form of volcanic lava. Some small igneous bodies, termed dikes,\r\ncan readily be seen along State Highway 100A adjacent to Calvin Coolidge\r\nState Forest Park (See photograph, Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nSedimentary rocks are formed in quite a different manner and differ in\r\ngeneral appearance. These are what might be considered second-hand\r\nrocks. They are composed of particles derived from other rocks, igneous,\r\nmetamorphic or older sedimentary, which have been carried by streams,\r\nwind or ice to a place of rest and there cemented into rock. Perhaps you\r\ncan visualize a river which, throughout its course, runs over rocks of\r\nmany types. This river would pick up particles of rock from its bed and\r\nbanks and transport these to a lake or perhaps the sea, where the\r\nvarious transported materials would settle to the bottom in distinct\r\nlayers. The first layer deposited would become buried under thousands of\r\ntons of overlying layers of sediment whose weight and resultant\r\npressure, together with the presence of adequate rock-cementing material\r\nsuch as calcium carbonate or silica, would cause the bottom layer to\r\nharden into rock. The layered appearance of sedimentary rocks is one of\r\ntheir most characteristic features and these rocks are said to be bedded\r\nor composed of many individual beds of sedimentary rock. Sandstone,\r\ncomposed of sand size particles; shale, originally mud; and limestone,\r\nonce lime-rich mud, are examples of sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nMetamorphic rocks result when igneous or sedimentary rocks are subjected\r\nto abnormal heat and pressure. Folding or _faulting_[2] of rocks within\r\nthe earth’s crust or deep burial beneath overlying rocks or sediments\r\ncommonly produce metamorphism. The introduction of hot fluids during\r\nfolding and faulting greatly increase the speed and degree of\r\nmetamorphic conversion. When igneous or sedimentary rocks are subjected\r\nto metamorphism they tend to lose their original appearance as some\r\nminerals are completely changed or altered into new minerals and most of\r\nthe original minerals are oriented in one or more preferred directions.\r\nThe degree of heat and pressure, type and amount of hot fluids provided\r\nand the type of rock undergoing metamorphism will determine the nature\r\nof the metamorphic rock to develop. Perhaps the most unfortunate effect\r\ncaused by the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks, especially when\r\nconsidering the history recorded in the rocks, is that in the majority\r\nof cases all fossils originally present are either destroyed or\r\ndistorted beyond recognition. The absence of fossils makes age\r\ndetermination quite difficult and hinders definition of previous\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\nThe rocks seen in and adjacent to Coolidge State Forest Park, with very\r\nfew exceptions, are metamorphic rocks which were originally sedimentary\r\nrocks. Luckily the metamorphism is slight and several pages of geologic\r\nhistory can still be read. Schists, phyllites and _quartzites_[3], all\r\nmetamorphic rocks, are well displayed in the Forest Park region.\r\n\r\nThe parallel arrangement of mica plates and segregation of the darker\r\nminerals into distinct layers in the schists and phyllites together with\r\nthe inherited sedimentary layering in the quartzites, impart a\r\ndistinctly visible orientation to the rocks seen in the Forest Park. The\r\nparallelism of the mica and segregation of the darker minerals in the\r\nschists and phyllites is directly related to metamorphic processes and\r\nthe measurable orientation is called foliation. The original sedimentary\r\nlayering of the quartzites, little changed through the metamorphism, is\r\nreferred to as bedding. From all indications the foliation and bedding\r\nare practically parallel in this region and since most of the rocks\r\nrepresented are of the metamorphic type, all orientation features will\r\nbe referred to as foliation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2. Block diagram illustrating the dip and\r\n    strike of foliation. The top of the block is considered an\r\n    “imaginary horizontal plane.”]\r\n\r\nThe geologist uses the terms dip and strike to describe foliation and\r\nuses conventional symbols for plotting purposes (See geologic map). The\r\ndip of the foliation is the angle between an imaginary horizontal line\r\nand the tilt or downward slope of the foliation. The strike is the\r\ncompass direction of a line formed by the dipping foliation plane and\r\nits intersection with an imaginary horizontal plane (See block diagram,\r\nFig. 2). A glance at the geological map will show that the rocks of the\r\nPark area consistently strike north to northwest and dip to the east. If\r\nyou look at the foliation symbols which are plotted on the geologic map,\r\nthe straight line of the symbol indicates the strike and the black\r\ntriangle points in the direction of the dip. The angles of dip have not\r\nbeen included on the map; however, they average forty-five degrees down\r\nfrom the horizontal and toward the east or right margin of the\r\ngeological map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n THE ROCKS OF CALVIN COOLIDGE STATE FOREST PARK AND THE STORY THEY TELL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks of Calvin Coolidge State Forest Park can be divided into four\r\ndistinct units or _formations_[4]. The geologic map shows these\r\nformations as distinct bands, each band representing a different\r\nformation and its intersection with the ground surface. Each formation\r\nis, so to speak, stacked upon the next older with the oldest forming the\r\nwestern band and the youngest on the east. Remember that these\r\nmetamorphic rock formations were originally sedimentary in nature and\r\nwere deposited in a nearly horizontal position on the floor on an\r\nancient sea. The fact that they are now tilted indicates that earth\r\nmovements have taken place sometime after the sedimentary rocks hardened\r\nbut before the present time.\r\n\r\nThe _Pinney Hollow formation_, the oldest formation of rocks seen in the\r\nForest Park, was named for the excellent exposures of this formation in\r\nPinney Hollow, a valley located along the western border of Coolidge\r\nForest. You can readily see this formation, in its most typical\r\ndevelopment, along State Highway 100A about three-tenths of a mile south\r\nof the Park entrance road. Here, a historical monument which\r\ncommemorates the naming of Pinney Hollow, is embedded in this formation\r\n(See photograph, Fig. 3). The lean-to, tent platform and picnic areas\r\nare situated on this formation and its rocks are easily observed. It is\r\ninteresting to note that some of the Pinney Hollow rocks seen in these\r\ncamping and picnicking spots differ from the typical rocks seen along\r\nState Highway 100A. In fact, some of the rocks which are dark and are\r\nclassed as phyllites, can be confused with the overlying Ottauquechee\r\nrocks. A transition zone, several hundred feet wide, exists between\r\nthese two formations and in which the two distinct rock types are\r\nintermingled. This “mixture” zone indicates that there was no break in\r\nthe original deposition of these two formations and therefore the rock\r\nrecord during this time is complete.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:   GEOLOGIC MAP OF CALVIN COOLIDGE STATE\r\n                                  FOREST PARK\r\n                              INDEX MAP OF VERMONT]\r\n\r\n  EXPLANATION\r\n    TRAIL\r\n    SECONDARY ROAD (GOOD)\r\n    SECONDARY ROAD (POOR)\r\n    STATE ROUTE 100A\r\n    STATE PROPERTY LINE\r\n    CONTOUR LINE WITH ELEV.\r\n    STREAM\r\n    FOLIATION\r\n  {FORMATIONS}\r\n    MISSISQUOI FORMATION\r\n    BETHEL FORMATION\r\n    OTTAUQUECHEE FORMATION\r\n    PINNEY HOLLOW FORMATION\r\n  TOPOGRAPHY FROM U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MAP\r\n  GEOLOGY BY H. W. DODGE, JR.\r\n\r\nThe Pinney Hollow formation, which is an estimated 2,300 or more feet\r\nthick, is primarily composed of pale-green _schist_[5] with abundant\r\nwhite quartz layers and lenses sandwiched between the dominantly\r\ngreenish colored rock. Originally these metamorphic rocks were sand, mud\r\nand sandy mud deposited on a relatively shallow sea floor. After burial\r\nthese sediments hardened into thin layers and lenses of sandstone,\r\nshale, and sandy shale. Metamorphism has since converted many of the\r\nshale minerals into mica flakes and some of the sandy shales produced\r\ncrystals of the mineral garnet. The pale-green color of the Pinney\r\nHollow schist is caused by the presence of the green mica-like mineral,\r\nchlorite, which developed during the process of metamorphism.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3. The Pinney Hollow Historical Monument\r\n    embedded in the Pinney Hollow formation. The darker rock consists of\r\n    pale-green schist and the white areas are quartz layers and lenses.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NORTH 20 WEST 25 RODS\r\n                             FROM THIS SPOT\r\n                         STOOD THE LOG CABIN OF\r\n                            Jonathan Pinney\r\n                                   &\r\n                        Priscilla Grover Pinney\r\n                            WHO SETTLED HERE A.D.\r\n                         1800.

This dates\r\nthese rocks as approximately 500 million years old.\r\n\r\nThe _Ottauquechee formation_, next above the Pinney Hollow formation and\r\ntherefore younger in age, was named for the Ottauquechee River along\r\nwhich this formation is well exposed and was first studied in detail.\r\nThe Ottauquechee River is located just north of Calvin Coolidge State\r\nForest Park where it flows through the towns of Bridgewater and\r\nBridgewater Corners. You can see this formation along State Highway 100A\r\napproximately nine-tenths of a mile north of the Park entrance road.\r\nHere, the formation crops out on the west side of the road, or on your\r\nleft if traveling toward Bridgewater Corners (See photograph, Fig. 4). A\r\nhike along the recently diamond-blazed Coolidge Forest trail, which\r\nleads from behind the Ranger’s cabin to the Picnic area, affords an\r\nalmost continuous view of this formation. The highly resistant quartzite\r\nlayers within the Ottauquechee formation are very conspicuous features\r\nalong this trail as they form several ridges trending across the\r\nfootpath.\r\n\r\nThe Ottauquechee formation, estimated to be 3,000 feet thick, contains\r\nrocks which contrast sharply with the underlying pale-green schists. The\r\nformation consists of alternating black phyllite and layers, up to\r\nseveral feet thick, of dark- to light-colored quartzite. The black\r\ncarbonaceous color of the phyllites and dark quartzites indicate the\r\npresence of life, either animal or plant, during the original deposition\r\nof the sediments forming these rocks. The phyllite was, before\r\nmetamorphism, a black shale which formed from black muds rich in organic\r\nmatter. From studies done in areas where black muds are accumulating\r\ntoday it seems quite probable that the ocean waters of Ottauquechee time\r\nwere of a restricted nature, that is to say, the waters were stagnant\r\ndue to the lack of oxygen. Pinney Hollow shallow marine water conditions\r\nremained, but for some reason, such as a barrier of islands or shallow\r\nwater sand bars, the circulation of ocean waters was hindered, leading\r\nto the accumulation of stagnant organic matter on the ocean bottom. This\r\norganic matter gives the Ottauquechee phyllite and some quartzites a\r\ndark to black color.\r\n\r\nNo fossils have been found in the Ottauquechee formation of the Coolidge\r\nForest Park, but, as with the Pinney Hollow formation, evidence from\r\nother areas indicates a Cambrian or perhaps Ordovician age for this\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4. The Ottauquechee formation as exposed\r\n    approximately nine-tenths of a mile north of the Park entrance road\r\n    and on the west side of State Highway 100A. Note the massive\r\n    quartzite layers above, the black phyllite below.]\r\n\r\nAbove the Ottauquechee rocks lie those of the _Bethel formation_.\r\nApproximately 2,000 feet thick, this formation is composed mainly of\r\npale-green schist with interlaminated thin layers of white to greenish\r\nquartzite. The rock presents a distinct banded appearance and contains\r\nconspicuous crystals of garnet and the black mica, biotite. The best\r\nview of this schist is found along State Highway 100A and slightly over\r\ntwo miles north of the Park entrance road. The relatively steep rock\r\ncliffs which line the west side of this road are composed of the\r\nresistant Bethel formation. In the northeast portion of Coolidge Forest\r\nPark several excellent exposures of this formation in contact with the\r\nunderlying Ottauquechee formation can be seen, but, to reach these areas\r\nyou would have to leave the beaten trail. If you are interested in\r\nvisiting these contact locations it would be best to consult the\r\ngeologic map for approximate directions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5.

Shale,\r\nsandy shale and thin-bedded sandstones formed under shallow water marine\r\nconditions; however, restriction with accompanied organic accumulation\r\ndid not occur. This formation is thought to be of either Cambrian or\r\nOrdovician age.\r\n\r\nThe easternmost, and therefore youngest formation to be found in the\r\nPark area is known as the _Missisquoi formation_. This formation, which\r\nis only partially represented here, is made up of dark phyllite, light\r\nblue-gray schist with conspicuous crystals of garnet and biotite, and\r\ngray quartzite. The rocks of this formation can be seen along Broad\r\nBrook which flows north along the eastern border of Coolidge State\r\nForest Park.\r\n\r\nThis formation is considered Ordovician in age with the conditions of\r\ndeposition being quite similar to those which existed during\r\nOttauquechee time. Once again the ocean waters were restricted and\r\norganic-rich black muds accumulated in quantity on the ocean floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE GEOLOGIC HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early geologic history of Calvin Coolidge State Forest Park is known\r\nfrom the rock formations discussed in the previous section of this\r\npamphlet. The Pinney Hollow, Ottauquechee, Bethel and Missisquoi\r\nformations of Cambrian and Ordovician age were deposited, essentially\r\nhorizontally, from the shallow seas which covered this area 550 to 450\r\nmillion years ago (See cross section A, Fig. 5). During some of this\r\ntime these seas were at least partially restricted as evidenced by the\r\nOttauquechee and Missisquoi black phyllites. Other Ordovician formations\r\nwere deposited on top of these four formations, but have been completely\r\nstripped away by erosion during the millions of years since their\r\ndeposition. Some of these later Ordovician sediments contain great\r\nthicknesses of volcanic rocks which probably covered the Coolidge Park\r\narea.\r\n\r\nSometime after these later Ordovician rocks formed, great stresses\r\nwithin the earth’s crust folded and in some places faulted these older\r\nrocks. The pressure and resultant heat created during these earth\r\nmovements converted the rocks into metamorphic schists, phyllites and\r\nquartzites which are seen today (See cross section B, Fig. 5). Exactly\r\nwhen these diastropic events took place is still open to question, but\r\nthey probably occurred near the end of Ordovician time or perhaps\r\nmillions of years later during the last phases of the Devonian Period.\r\n\r\nProbably since late Paleozoic time the Coolidge Park area has been\r\nsubjected to breaking-down rather than building-up processes. Eventually\r\nthis whole region was reduced to a flat plane with only a few hills,\r\ncalled monadnocks, rising above the general flatness of the landscape.\r\nStill later in the history of Coolidge State Forest Park this flat plane\r\nwas lifted high above its former position and streams began to shape the\r\nland into its present form. The more resistant rocks were lowered by the\r\nforces of erosion at a much slower rate than the less resistant types.\r\nThe hills and valleys which you see today are primarily the result of\r\nthis general uplift followed by the wearing away of the softer rocks at\r\na more rapid rate than the harder rock types. Since the formations trend\r\nin a north-north-west direction, the hills and valleys are also oriented\r\nin this general direction, as the different resistive qualities of the\r\nrocks are presented in this pattern.\r\n\r\nThe story is not complete without mention of the last modifying\r\ninfluence to affect this region. Approximately one million years ago the\r\nfirst of perhaps three glacial advances began. These large glacial\r\nmasses, termed continental glaciers, slowly advanced southward over the\r\nnorthern sections of the United States and covered a vast region with a\r\nthick sheet of ice. As these ice masses rode over the Coolidge Park\r\nregion they tended to round-off irregular features of the landscape and\r\nto fill in certain low regions with their transported rock debris. The\r\nrather smooth outlines of the hills in Coolidge Forest Park and the sand\r\nand gravel deposits so apparent adjacent to nearby streams tell the\r\nstory of these glacial advances and subsequent withdrawals. Other\r\nevidence of the overriding ice is seen in the presence of scratch marks,\r\ntermed glacial striae, which were produced by fragments of rock as they\r\nwere dragged by the moving ice across the underlying rocks. Along the\r\neast bank of Broad Brook and approximately two hundred yards south of\r\nthe bridge at Five Corners, abundant glacial striae are clearly\r\ndisplayed. The orientation of these striae indicates that the glacier\r\nproducing them moved from north north-west to the south south-east.\r\n\r\nSince the recession of the last ice sheet, which took place several\r\nthousand years ago, the general appearance of the Coolidge Park region\r\nhas changed very little. The streams have cut their valleys somewhat\r\ndeeper and some of the glacial sands and gravels have been\r\nredistributed. A few thousand years ago Coolidge State Forest Park\r\nlooked quite the same as it does today (See cross section C, Fig. 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SIDE TRIPS OF GEOLOGICAL INTEREST\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gold Panning_\r\n\r\nThere are several locations immediately adjacent to the Calvin Coolidge\r\nState Forest Park where some gold can still be obtained from stream\r\nsands and gravels. The abandoned town of Five Corners offers the park\r\nvisitor ample chance to “try his luck.” In fact, several local people\r\nstill obtain small gold nuggets and a good deal of gold dust from the\r\nstreams in the vicinity of Five Corners (See geologic map for geographic\r\nlocation). Other possible “panning” locations would include Reading Pond\r\nBrook, Buffalo Brook and Kingdom Brook. The gold which is found is\r\nprobably derived from nearby gold-bearing quartz veins.\r\n\r\nThe equipment needed for an afternoon of panning is relatively simple to\r\nobtain. A wide, rather shallow pan with gently sloping sides is really\r\nall that is needed. Gravel and sand, which you find concentrated on the\r\nupstream side of natural rock riffles in the stream bed should be placed\r\ntogether with water in your pan. Then the pan should be rotated and the\r\nlighter rock materials decanted. The heavy gold will be concentrated in\r\nthe bottom of the pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Asbestos and Talc_\r\n\r\nFor you who might be interested in mineral collecting it is suggested\r\nthat a trip to an old pit near Five Corners might prove rewarding. Walk\r\ndown Broad Brook from the bridge at Five Corners until you locate the\r\nfirst small tributary entering on your left. Turn left up this tributary\r\nand continue to walk for approximately one hundred yards. On your left\r\nyou will see the remains of a pit dug into the side of the stream bank\r\nwhich, at this location, is lined with rocks of the Ottauquechee\r\nformation. You will quickly note the fibrous asbestos in the walls of\r\nthis pit; however, if you wish to collect specimens of this mineral be\r\nextremely careful and avoid standing beneath any overhanging rock\r\nmaterial. Talc, which feels “soapy” to the touch, is also abundant in\r\nthis immediate area. This asbestos and talc occur in a lenticular-shaped\r\nbody which is perhaps eight hundred feet wide and of an undetermined\r\nlength. It is not certain when these minerals formed; however, it was\r\nprobably in the early history of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Garnet_\r\n\r\nGood specimens of garnet can be found in the rocks of the Bethel\r\nformation. These garnets are not of gem quality but still offer good\r\ncollecting for the amateur mineralogist. Good collecting localities\r\nexist along State Highway 100A and at several different spots within the\r\nPark itself. A hike along the northern boundary of the Park would\r\nintersect several excellent collecting spots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vermont Marble Company Exhibit, Proctor, Vermont_\r\n\r\nIf time permits, or a rainy day arrives, a visit to the Vermont Marble\r\nCompany Exhibit in Proctor, Vermont, is highly recommended. Marble is a\r\nmetamorphic rock which was originally sedimentary in nature. Lime muds\r\nhardened into limestones and then, converted by metamorphism, became\r\nmarble. The marble exhibit at Proctor, termed “The largest Marble\r\nExhibit in the World,” displays over 100 varieties of marble and igneous\r\nrock, granite. Fossils can be seen in some of the varieties of marble,\r\nwhich demonstrates that under certain conditions recognizable fossils do\r\noccur in metamorphic rocks. Most of the marble seen in this exhibit is\r\nquarried nearby; however, for safety reasons visitors are not allowed to\r\nenter the quarries. It is interesting to note that these marbles are\r\nabout the same age as the rocks seen in Coolidge State Forest Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Footnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]A rock, for those desiring a more technical definition, is any\r\n    relatively hard, naturally occurring, combination of minerals which\r\n    form an essential part of the earth. Minerals are composed of one or\r\n    more chemical elements, such as oxygen or silicon, that form in\r\n    nature.\r\n\r\n[2]A fault is a break or fracture in the rocks of the earth’s crust\r\n    where one side of the fracture moves in some direction relative to\r\n    the other side. Some recent earthquakes in California and Nevada\r\n    have produced visible faults where, for instance, roads were cut and\r\n    one side displaced several yards from the other.\r\n\r\n[3]Most of the mineral grains which make up a schist, a metamorphosed\r\n    shale or sandy shale, can be seen with the naked eye, and the\r\n    parallel to subparallel arrangement of platy or flaky minerals, such\r\n    as the abundant mica, is the most obvious feature. In bright\r\n    sunlight a schist presents a very shiny, almost silvery appearance\r\n    which is caused by the reflection of sunlight from the many parallel\r\n    mica plates. A phyllite has much the same mineral composition as\r\n    that of a schist; however, the individual mineral grains are too\r\n    small to be seen without the aid of a magnifying glass. As with the\r\n    schist, a phyllite when viewed in direct sunlight, appears shiny.\r\n    Quartzites are metamorphosed sandstones which have been fused into\r\n    great hardness through the application of heat and pressure.\r\n\r\n[4]A geologic formation consists of a group of similar rocks, or\r\n    sequence of rocks, which can be easily distinguished from adjacent\r\n    rocks and whose distribution can be plotted on a map.\r\n\r\n[5]More technically this schist is termed a chlorite-sericite-quartz\r\n    schist.\r\n\r\n[6]The geologist divides geologic time into four major sections,\r\n    designated Eras. These Eras are in turn subdivided into Geologic\r\n    Periods which are of shorter time duration. The Cambrian Period is\r\n    the oldest of the Paleozoic Era and began some 550 million years\r\n    ago. The Ordovician Period is the next oldest of the Paleozoic Era\r\n    and started about 440 million years ago and ended close to 360\r\n    million years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
