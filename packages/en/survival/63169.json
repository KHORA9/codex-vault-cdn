A. Hollowell, _senior agronomist, Division of Forage Crops and\r\nDiseases, Bureau of Plant Industry_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Growth and Distribution=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover (_Trifolium incarnatum_) is the most important winter\r\nannual legume of the central section of the Eastern States (fig. 1).\r\nBesides being an excellent hay plant and furnishing an abundance of\r\nearly spring pasture, it affords protection to the soil during the fall,\r\nwinter, and spring, prevents soil washing, and provides green manure for\r\nsoil improvement. This legume has the distinct advantage of being a heavy\r\nproducer of seed, which can be easily harvested and sown without the use\r\nof expensive machinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--Principal crimson clover region of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is a native of Europe and is widely grown in France,\r\nHungary, and other central and southern European countries. Seed was\r\nintroduced into this country as early as 1819, but it was not until 1880\r\nthat the plant became of agricultural importance. During the last 6 years\r\nthe annual commercial consumption of seed in the United States has ranged\r\nfrom 2 to 4 million pounds. In addition, large quantities of home-grown\r\nseed are used and handled from farm to farm.\r\n\r\nThe common name of this clover is derived from the distinctive bright\r\ncrimson color of the blossoms. Other common names, such as German clover\r\nand scarlet clover, are frequently heard in different localities. In\r\ngeneral the leaves and stems of crimson clover resemble red clover, but\r\nare distinguished by the rounding of the tips of the leaves and a greater\r\ncovering of hair on both leaves and steins. When it is planted in the\r\nfall the leaves develop from the crown and form a rosette, which enlarges\r\nwhenever weather conditions are favorable. In late spring flower stems\r\ndevelop rapidly and terminate their growth with elongated flower heads.\r\nSeed forms and the plant dies with the advent of hot summer weather. The\r\nseed is yellow, slightly larger, and more rounding than red clover seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adaptation=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is adapted to cool, humid weather and is tolerant of winter\r\nconditions where the temperature does not become severe or too variable.\r\nIn this region (fig. 1) it should be planted in late summer or early fall,\r\nsince early establishment and growth are favorable to its winter survival.\r\nIt will thrive on both sandy and clay soils and is tolerant of ordinary\r\nsoil acidity. On extremely poor soils, stands are difficult to obtain and\r\nthe growth is stunted. The use of manure and phosphate fertilizers on such\r\nsoils will improve the chances of obtaining good stands.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may also be successfully grown as a summer annual in Maine,\r\nnorthern Michigan, and Minnesota. The winter culture of this clover\r\nmay be extended into Kentucky, southern Missouri, and southern Indiana\r\nprovided the seed is sown in fertile soil early in August. Production may\r\nbe successfully extended southward with an increase of soil fertility and\r\nwith seeding delayed until soil-moisture conditions are favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seedbed Preparation=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important and difficult phase of successful production of crimson\r\nclover is getting a stand. Sufficient soil moisture to germinate the seed\r\nand to establish the seedlings is the greatest factor in obtaining a\r\nstand, which when established usually produces a good crop.\r\n\r\nSeedings are usually made in late August or early September between\r\nthe rows of cultivated crops. Under such conditions an ideal seedbed\r\nis difficult to prepare, therefore careful preparation is necessary.\r\nFurthermore, the crop plants in the row shade the clover seedlings and\r\nseriously compete with them for the available moisture. Increasing the\r\ndistance between the rows and planting the row crop more thinly will\r\nafford better opportunity for the establishment of the clover. When\r\nplanted between the rows of other crops, the seed is usually broadcast on\r\nthe surface and covered by cultivating or harrowing (fig. 2). Drilling\r\nthe seed after the soil surface has been stirred will usually give more\r\ncomplete stands than broadcasting, and it may be done with a small\r\none-horse drill. The seed should not be planted more than one-half to\r\nthree-fourths of an inch deep, respectively, in clay and sandy soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Seeding crimson clover in corn.]\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is often seeded following a grain crop, and this is a\r\nsurer method of establishing a stand than planting between the rows of\r\ncultivated crops, providing the seedbed is well prepared. After the grain\r\ncrop is removed the soil is plowed or disked and allowed to settle. This\r\nis followed by light harrowing or disking when necessary to kill weed\r\nseedlings. Before the clover is seeded the soil should be firmly packed,\r\nbecause a loose cloddy seedbed is the forerunner of failure. The seed may\r\nbe either drilled or broadcast, but drilling will give more uniform stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fertilizers=\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the crop is planted on extremely poor soils, good stands and\r\ngrowth cannot be expected. Such soil conditions may be improved by the\r\napplication of manure and phosphate fertilizers or by turning under such\r\ncrops as cowpeas, soybeans, or lespedeza. In many soils of low fertility\r\nthe use of 50 to 100 pounds per acre of a nitrogen fertilizer will\r\nencourage early seedling growth and establishment. On the fertile soils of\r\nthis region crimson clover may be successfully grown without fertilizer,\r\nbut on most soils applications of 200 pounds of phosphate fertilizer per\r\nacre are profitable in obtaining stands and vigorous growth (fig. 3). The\r\nuse of potash is recommended when a deficiency is known to exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Effect of phosphate application on good soil:\r\nTreated (left); untreated (right).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seed Sources=\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the total amount of seed normally used approximately 60 percent is\r\nof foreign origin, coming principally from Hungary and France. Most of\r\nthe domestic crimson clover seed offered on the market is produced in\r\nsouth-central Tennessee. While white-flowered strains and others differing\r\nin maturity have been isolated, they are little used. Claims have been\r\nmade that locally grown seed is superior to seed from other sources\r\nincluding that of foreign origin. Further experiments are needed to\r\ndetermine whether such differences actually exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rate and Time of Seeding=\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary conditions 15 to 18 pounds of hulled seed will give good\r\nstands unless there is a deficiency of soil moisture. Depending upon the\r\namount of foreign material 45 to 60 pounds of unhulled seed is comparable\r\nto a 15-pound seeding rate of hulled seed. Crimson clover may be sown from\r\nthe middle of August until October 1 with the expectation of securing a\r\ngood stand. The later it is seeded the less growth can be expected and\r\nthe more readily winterkilling occurs. The early establishment of the\r\nplants becomes more important as plantings are extended northward. Seeding\r\ncrimson clover, if possible, either immediately before or following heavy\r\nrains will increase its chances of making a stand. The spring planting of\r\ncrimson clover in or south of the Corn Belt usually results in a short,\r\nstunted growth followed by meager blossoming and an unprofitable yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Inoculation=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the crimson clover region it is not necessary to\r\ninoculate the seed; but if clover has not been successfully grown on a\r\nsoil, inoculation of the seed is good insurance. If the plants are not\r\ninoculated they will develop slowly, become yellow, and die. Inoculated\r\nplants are able to obtain about two-thirds of their nitrogen from the air\r\nthrough their root nodules. The plants may be artificially inoculated by\r\napplying pure cultures of the bacteria to the seed or by scattering soil\r\nfrom a field where inoculated crimson clover has been grown. Two hundred\r\nto three hundred pounds per acre of such soil evenly distributed at\r\nseeding time is sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Unhulled Seed=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of unhulled seed offers the distinct advantage of increasing\r\nthe chance of obtaining thick stands. With the prevalence of dry soil\r\nconditions, light rainfall does not cause the unhulled seed to germinate,\r\nbut hulled seed germinates readily and the seedlings may die from lack of\r\nmoisture before they can become established.\r\n\r\nIts bulky nature makes unhulled seed more difficult to distribute\r\nuniformly than hulled seed. It must be broadcast and may be harrowed in.\r\nIt is also difficult to market and is not generally handled by the seed\r\ntrade. But farmers can harvest seed for their own use and save the expense\r\nof having it hulled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Companion Crops=\r\n\r\n\r\nRye, vetch, Italian ryegrass, and fall-sown grain crops are often seeded\r\nwith crimson clover. Besides making a valuable addition to the clover\r\n(fig. 4), these companion crops help bolster up a thin stand. Such crops\r\nare seeded from one-half to one-third the normal crop rate and the crimson\r\nclover is seeded at the normal rate. Planting is done at the same time,\r\nbut, as a greater depth is required for most of the seed of the companion\r\ncrops, two seeding operations are necessary. In Tennessee, farmers often\r\nuse a mixture of 5 pounds of red clover and 10 pounds of crimson clover\r\nper acre with excellent results. The first growth of the mixture may be\r\ngrazed or harvested for hay or for crimson clover seed, while the second\r\ncrop is wholly red clover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Crimson clover and rye, an excellent\r\ngreen-manure combination.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diseases and Insects=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only serious disease that affects crimson clover is stem rot. The\r\neffect of this disease is seen in the early spring and is characterized by\r\nthe plants dying in patches. The stems rot at the surface of the soil or\r\nwhere they join the crown. The occurrence of continued damp cool weather\r\nduring early spring favors the development of the disease. Exclusion of\r\nclover and other legumes from the rotation for a period of 2 to 5 years is\r\nthe best control method.\r\n\r\nSandy soils in the southern part of the crimson clover belt are often\r\ninfested with nematodes. Nematode injury results in a stunting and\r\nyellowing of the plants and is most prevalent in the southern part of the\r\nregion. While the clover-seed chalcid, the pea aphid, and other insects\r\nsometimes become numerous in crimson clover, insects do not ordinarily\r\ncause appreciable damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Utilization=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover grows rapidly in early spring and furnishes an abundance\r\nof early grazing (fig. 5). If planted early and an abundant fall growth\r\nis made, the clover may also be grazed during the fall and winter months.\r\nSuch a practice has been successfully followed in Tennessee, where crimson\r\nclover has provided the winter pasturage. The grazing, however, should be\r\nrestricted to periods when the soil is relatively dry, otherwise damage\r\nmay result from trampling. Animals grazing on crimson clover seldom bloat;\r\nhowever, it is advisable not to turn them into clover fields for the\r\nfirst time when they are hungry. Bloat is less likely to occur when a\r\nmixture of clover and grass or grain is grazed than when the clover alone\r\nis grazed. As crimson clover reaches maturity the hairs of the heads and\r\nstems become hard and tough. When grazed continuously or when fed as\r\nhay at this stage of maturity large masses of the hairs are liable to\r\nform into hair balls in stomachs of horses and mules. Occasionally the\r\nhair balls are responsible for the death of animals. If small amounts of\r\nother feeds, particularly roughages, are fed along with the clover, the\r\nformation of these balls will be reduced. Cattle, sheep, and swine do not\r\nseem to be affected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--Crimson clover provides an abundance of early\r\nspring grazing.]\r\n\r\nCrimson clover makes excellent hay when cut at the early bloom stage\r\nalthough the yield may be slightly reduced. For maximum yields it should\r\nbe harvested in full bloom. The hay is easily cured either in the swath\r\nor in the windrow. Fewer leaves are lost and less bleaching occurs in\r\nwindrowed hay. Although yields as high as 2½ tons per acre are not\r\nuncommon on fertile soil, 1½ to 2 tons is an ordinary production.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is an ideal green-manure crop. For the best result it\r\nshould be plowed under 2 to 3 weeks before planting the succeeding crop.\r\nThis gives sufficient time for decomposition, which is rapid unless the\r\ncrop is mature when plowed under. Occasionally, strips are plowed in which\r\nrow crops are planted, allowing the clover between the plowed strips\r\nto mature. Seed may be harvested by hand from the clover between the\r\nrow crop, and the remaining clover straw allowed to mat and serve as a\r\nmulch, or the entire plant may be permitted to form a mulch. A volunteer\r\nseeding may be secured in this way, especially in the northern part of\r\nthis region, but attempts to follow such a practice should be tried on a\r\nsmall scale until experience is gained. When used in orchards, crimson\r\nclover is often allowed to mature, after which it is disked into the soil.\r\nOccasionally a volunteer seeding may be obtained in the fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seed Production=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is a prolific seed-producing plant and yields of 5 to\r\n10 bushels per acre are common, depending upon the thickness of the\r\nstand, the amount of growth that is produced, and the care exercised in\r\nharvesting the seed. The florets are self-fertile, but bees are effective\r\nin tripping and transferring the pollen, with a consequent increase in the\r\nnumber of seed per head. The placing of colonies of honeybees adjacent\r\nto blooming fields will effectively increase pollination. More seed is\r\nusually produced on soils of medium fertility than on rich soils, since\r\nfertile soils seem to stimulate the growth of stems and leaves at the\r\nexpense of flower-head development.\r\n\r\nLarge yields and ease of harvesting crimson clover seed are the principal\r\nreasons why crimson clover is such an ideal legume crop. Farmers may save\r\nseed with very little expense other than their own labor. When the seed\r\nheads are mature they readily shatter and are easily harvested either by\r\nhand stripping or by using horse-drawn homemade strippers. One bushel of\r\nunhulled seed contains about 2 pounds of hulled seed, and although bulky\r\nin nature, it can be easily stored on the farm until fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--Cutting a crimson clover seed crop with a mower\r\nequipped with a bunching attachment.]\r\n\r\nWhen the seed is mature the crop is cut with a mower, which may be\r\nequipped with a bunching or windrowing attachment (fig. 6) or it may be\r\nharvested with a combine. During wet seasons difficulties in combining the\r\nseed from standing plants may be experienced. Under such conditions the\r\nplants may be cut and windrowed and then threshed by the combine from the\r\nwindrow. As crimson clover shatters easily when ripe, cutting with the\r\nmower when the heads are damp with dew or rain is recommended. If allowed\r\nto stand too long after it is ripe a beating rain will shatter much of\r\nthe seed. After a few days of curing, the seed is hulled with an ordinary\r\nclover huller or a grain separator equipped with hulling attachments. The\r\nless the clover is handled, the less seed will be lost by shattering.\r\n\r\nTroublesome weeds are encountered in growing crimson clover seed; field\r\npeppergrass (_Lepidium campestre_) and wintercress (_Barbarea praecox_)\r\nare probably the worst, as their separation from the clover seed is\r\ndifficult. Little barley (_Hordeum pusillum_) is objectionable in unhulled\r\nseed, and the use of unhulled seed will naturally increase the prevalence\r\nof this weed.\r\n\r\n\r\nU. S.
