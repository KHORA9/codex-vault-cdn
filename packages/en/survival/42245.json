ELLARD GORE, F.R.A.S.\r\n              With 3 Plates and 288 Illustrations.\r\n\r\n     \"The six books into which the book is divided give a very\r\n     lucid and accurate description of the knowledge which has\r\n     been acquired of the moving bodies of space, both as respects\r\n     their motions and physical constitutions. Of the translation\r\n     we can only speak in terms of praise. Not only does it well\r\n     represent the original, but Mr. Gore has added useful notes\r\n     for the purpose of bringing the information up to date, and\r\n     has also increased the number--already very considerable--of\r\n     the excellent illustrations, so that the work is likely to\r\n     become as popular in England as it has been in\r\n     France.\"--ATHENÆUM.\r\n\r\n     \"The work which Mr. J. E. Gore has translated into English\r\n     has made for itself a name and reputation in France ... and\r\n     has gone into general circulation to the number of a hundred\r\n     thousand copies. This last fact is proof how well within the\r\n     bounds of possibility it is to make the latest discoveries of\r\n     science comprehensible and fascinating to the common mind. M.\r\n     Flammarion has attained this triumph through the grasp of his\r\n     knowledge, the lucidity of his style, and his power of\r\n     bringing home the most stupendous and complicated of the\r\n     things revealed to us in the depths of space. M. Flammarion's\r\n     pages should find almost as great acceptance in this country\r\n     as in his own. Simplicity of arrangement and of statement are\r\n     part of his charm and of his success.\"--SCOTSMAN.\r\n\r\n     \"M. Flammarion's latest volume, if it does not displace its\r\n     English rivals, may well take a high place in the rank to\r\n     which they belong. It is full, lucid, and, thanks to Mr.\r\n     Gore's careful revision, well up to date.... Mr. Gore's\r\n     edition is so carefully brought abreast of the latest\r\n     discoveries that the English student may now congratulate\r\n     himself on being in an even better position than the\r\n     countrymen of M.

Never before has the science of the heavens been\r\n     treated with such fulness and interest as in this fascinating\r\n     book; for Flammarion is a man of letters as well as a man of\r\n     science--a man of letters, too, endowed with the wondrous\r\n     gifts of lucidity and charm which distinguish the best French\r\n     writers....

Perhaps in this way we should succeed one day in\r\ndetermining the still mysterious nature of these elusive forces. I,\r\nfor my part, have been engaged upon the task for many years past. It\r\nhas produced a big accumulation of records, and in this volume I can\r\nfind room but for a _résumé_ of them, as varied as possible. In my\r\nfirst chapter I shall present a few characteristic examples, just to\r\ngive my readers some hint of this variety.\r\n\r\nNot to go too far back, let us begin with a harmless--I might almost\r\nsay playful--fireball performance, of which M. Schnaufer, Professor at\r\nMarseilles, has given me the particulars.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1898, the fireball in question made its appearance in a\r\nroom and advanced towards a young girl who was seated at the table,\r\nher feet hanging down without touching the floor. The luminous globe\r\nmoved along the floor in the girl's direction, began to rise quite\r\nnear her and then round and round her, spiral fashion, darted off\r\ntowards a hole in the chimney--a hole made for the stove-pipe, and\r\nclosed up with glued paper--made its way up the chimney, and, on\r\nemerging into the open air, gave out upon the roof an appalling crash\r\nwhich shook the entire house. It was a case of coming in like a lamb\r\nand going out like a lion!\r\n\r\nA similar occurrence is recorded as having been observed in Paris, on\r\nJuly 5, 1852, in a tailor's room, including the same curious detail of\r\nthe departure through the hole in the chimney, closed up with paper.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Rue Saint Jacques, near the Val de Grâce. The fireball\r\nburst into the room from the chimney, knocking over the paper guard in\r\nfront of the fireplace. In appearance it suggested a young cat,\r\ngathered up into a ball, as it were, and moving along without using\r\nits paws. It approached the tailor's legs as though to play with them.\r\nThe tailor moved them away to avoid the contact, of which he naturally\r\nwas in terror. After some seconds, the globe of fire rose vertically\r\nto the height of the man's face as he sat, and he, to save himself,\r\nleaned quickly back and fell over. The fireball continued to rise,\r\nand made its way towards a hole which had been made at the top of the\r\nchimney for the insertion of a stove-pipe in the winter, but which, as\r\nthe tailor put it afterwards, \"the fireball couldn't see,\" because it\r\nwas closed up with paper. The ball stripped off the paper neatly,\r\nentered the chimney quite quietly, and having risen to the summit,\r\nproduced a tremendous explosion, which sent the chimney-top flying,\r\nand scattered it in bits all over the neighbouring courtyard and\r\nsurrounding roofs.\r\n\r\nThere we have a unique occurrence, recorded for us by Babinet and\r\nArago, and of which I have given here the exact particulars. In both\r\nthese cases we have to note the attraction of the hole in the chimney\r\nand the explosion of the thunderbolt on getting to the top. But it is\r\nnot easy to detect the law underlying these phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn one of the latest volumes of the Association Française a somewhat\r\nsimilar case is dealt with.\r\n\r\n\"A violent storm,\" says the writer, M. Wander, \"had descended upon the\r\ncommune of Beugnon (Deux-Sèvres). I happened to be passing through a\r\nfarm, in which were two children of about twelve and thirteen. These\r\nchildren were taking refuge from the rain under the door of a stable,\r\nin which were twenty-five oxen. In front of them extended a\r\ncourtyard, sloping downwards towards a large pond, twenty or thirty\r\nyards away, beside which grew a poplar-tree. Suddenly there appeared a\r\nglobe of fire, of the size of an apple, near the top of the poplar. We\r\nsaw it descend, branch by branch, and then down the trunk. It moved\r\nalong the courtyard _very slowly_, seeming almost to pick its way\r\nbetween the pools of water, and came up to the door where stood the\r\nchildren. One of them was bold enough to touch it with his foot.\r\nImmediately a terrible crash shook the entire farm to its foundations,\r\nthe two children were thrown to the ground uninjured, but eleven of\r\nthe animals in the stable were killed!\"\r\n\r\nWho is to explain these anomalies? The child who touched the fireball\r\nescapes with a fright, and a few feet behind him eleven animals out of\r\ntwenty-five perish on the spot!\r\n\r\nDuring the storm which broke out at the town of Gray, on July 7, 1886,\r\nmy friend M. Vannesson, President of the Tribunal, saw a fireball of\r\nfrom thirty to forty centimetres in diameter, which exploded on the\r\ncorner of a roof, cutting clean off the end portion of the central\r\nbeam to the length of about half a yard (like a bundle of matches, but\r\nwithout setting it on fire), scattering the splinters over the upper\r\nstory and loosening the plaster upon the walls below. It then\r\n_rebounded_ on the roofing of a little outside staircase, made a hole\r\nin it, smashing and sending flying the slates, came down upon the\r\nroad, and rolling right in the midst of some passers-by--who, like the\r\nchild in the farm, escaped with a fright--disappeared.\r\n\r\nMy learned fellow-member of the Astronomical Society of France, Dr.\r\nBougon, has discovered an account of one of the most remarkable\r\nfireballs ever recorded in _La Gloire des Confesseurs_, a work written\r\nby Gregory of Tours, the twentieth bishop of that town.\r\n\r\nOn the dedication day of an oratory which he had constructed in one of\r\nthe outer buildings of the episcopal palace, all the participants in\r\nthe procession from the cathedral, while approaching the oratory with\r\nthe sacred relics and singing the litanies, saw a globe of fire, so\r\nintensely brilliant that their eyes were dazzled, and they could\r\nscarcely keep them open. Seized with terror, priests, deacons,\r\nsub-deacons, choristers, together with the distinguished citizens of\r\nthe town, who were carrying the relics upon their shoulders, all with\r\none accord threw themselves on the ground, face downward. Then\r\nGregory, remembering that on the occasion of the death of St. Martin,\r\nsome of whose bones were among the relics being carried from the\r\ncathedral, a globe of fire was said to have been observed to leave the\r\nsaint's head and ascend heavenwards, believed himself to be in the\r\npresence of a miracle, vouchsafed as evidence at once of St. Martin's\r\nsanctity and the genuineness of his relics. This globe of fire did no\r\ndamage and burnt nothing. _Discurrebat autem per totam cellulam_,\r\nTANQUAM FULGUR, _globus igneus_.\r\n\r\nThere is to be seen at the Louvre a picture by Eustache Lesueur,\r\nentitled \"La Messe de Saint Martin,\" which seemed to me at first to\r\nillustrate this narrative, but the spectators are shown in silent\r\nwonder instead of being prostrated as in the story. Moreover, Gregory\r\nof Tours tells us in his life of St. Martin, that one day during Mass\r\na globe of fire was seen to appear above the head of the bishop, and\r\nthen to rise heavenwards, to the great edification of the devout. It\r\nwas this \"miracle,\" evidently, that Lesueur intended to represent.\r\n\r\nHere is another case of a remarkably harmless fireball which is often\r\ncited.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Spallanzani it is who tells the story. On August 29, 1791, a\r\nyoung peasant woman was in a field during a storm, when suddenly there\r\nappeared at her feet a globe of fire of about the size of a billiard\r\nball. Slipping along the ground, this little fireball reached her\r\nfeet, caressed them, as it were, made its way up under her clothes,\r\nand issued again from the middle of her bodice, and, still keeping its\r\nglobular form, darted off into the air and exploded noisily. When it\r\ngot under her petticoats, they blew out like an umbrella, and she fell\r\nback. Two witnesses of the scene ran to her assistance, but she was\r\nunhurt. A medical examination revealed only a slight erosion of the\r\nskin, extending from the right knee to the middle of her breast; her\r\nchemise had been torn in two along the same line, and there was a hole\r\nthrough her bodice where the thunderbolt had got out.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Memoirs of Du Bellay\" the following very curious narrative is\r\nto be found. In all probability it is a fireball that is in\r\nquestion:--\r\n\r\n\"On March 3, 1557, Diane of France, illegitimate daughter of Henri\r\nII., then the Dauphin, married François de Montmorency. On the night\r\nof their wedding, an oscillating flame came into their bedroom through\r\nthe window, went from corner to corner, and finally to the nuptial\r\nbed, where it burnt Diane's hair and night attire. It did them no\r\nother harm, but their terror can be imagined.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be as well to take with a pinch of salt the statement\r\nthat the lady's attire was burnt in this way without harm to her\r\nperson, yet there are other authentic stories of a similar kind almost\r\nas curious.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, at Linguy (Eure-et-Loire), a man and his wife were sleeping\r\nquietly, when suddenly a terrible crash made them jump out of bed.\r\nThey thought their last hour had come. The chimney, broken to pieces,\r\nhad fallen in and its wreckage filled the room, the gable-end was put\r\nout and the roof threatened to come down. The effects of the\r\nthunderbolt in the room itself were less alarming than its effects\r\noutside, but were very curious. For instance, bricks from one wall had\r\nbeen dashed horizontally against the wall opposite, with such\r\nextraordinary force that they were to be seen imbedded in it up above\r\na dresser upon which pots and pans, etc., were ranged, and within a\r\nfew inches of the ceiling, while the windows of the room had been\r\nsmashed into bits, and a looking-glass, detached from the wall, stood\r\non end whole and entire upon the floor, delicately balanced. A chair\r\nnear the bed, upon which articles of clothing had been placed, had\r\nbeen spirited away to a spot near the door. A small lamp and a box of\r\nmatches were to be found undamaged upon the floor. An old gun,\r\nsuspended from a beam, was violently shaken and had lost its ramrod.\r\n\r\nThe thunderbolt actually frolicked over the bed, leaving its occupants\r\nmore dead than alive from terror but quite unhurt. It passed within a\r\nfew inches of their heads and passed through a fissure in a partition\r\ninto an adjoining dairy, where it carried a whole row of milk-cans,\r\nfull of milk, from one side of the room to another, breaking the lids\r\nbut not upsetting a single can. It broke four plates out of a pile of\r\na dozen, leaving the remaining eight intact. It carried away the tap\r\nfrom a small barrel of wine, which emptied itself in consequence.\r\n\r\nIt ended by passing out through the window without further breakage,\r\nleaving the husband and wife unscathed but panic-stricken.\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest tricks to which lightning is addicted is that of\r\nundressing its victims. It displays much more skill and cleverness in\r\nsuch diversions than is to be found in animals or even in many human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nHere is one of the most curious instances of this on record, as\r\nnarrated by Morand:--\r\n\r\n\"A woman in man's costume. A storm suddenly comes on. A flash of\r\nlightning strikes her, carries off and destroys her clothes and boots.\r\nShe is left stark naked, and she has to be wrapped up in a cloth and\r\ntaken thus to the neighbouring village.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1898, at Courcelles-les-Sens, Mlles. Philomène Escalbert, aged 19,\r\nAdèle Delauffre, aged 22, and Madame Léonie Legère, aged 44, were\r\nstanding round a reaping-machine, when a flash of lightning struck\r\nMadame Legère and killed her on the spot. The two young girls were\r\nstripped to the skin, even their boots being torn from their feet.\r\nOtherwise they were left safe and sound--and astonished.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, 1868, seven persons took refuge during a storm under a\r\nhuge ash-tree near the village of Bonello, in the Commune of Perret\r\n(Côtes-du-Nord), when suddenly the tree was struck by lightning, and\r\none of them--a woman--was killed. The six others were knocked to the\r\nground without being seriously damaged. The clothes of the woman who\r\nhad been killed were torn into shreds, many of which were found\r\nclinging to the branches of the tree.\r\n\r\nOn May 11, 1869, a farmer at Ardillats was tilling the ground with his\r\ntwo oxen, not far from his dwelling-place, about four in the\r\nafternoon. The air was close and heavy, and the sky covered with black\r\nclouds. Suddenly there was a great thunderclap, and a flash of\r\nlightning struck both man and beasts dead on the spot. The man was\r\nfound stripped to the skin, and his boots had been carried thirty\r\nyards away.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1896, at Epervans (Saône-et-Loire), a young man named Petiot,\r\nwho was mowing in a meadow, was struck dead by lightning while\r\nlighting a cigarette, and left in a state of complete nakedness.\r\n\r\nOn August 11, 1855, a man was struck by lightning near Vallerois\r\n(Haute-Saône), and stripped naked. All that could be found afterwards\r\nof his clothes was a shirt-sleeve, a few other shreds, and some pieces\r\nof his hobnailed boots. Ten minutes after he was struck he regained\r\nconsciousness, opened his eyes, complained of the cold, and inquired\r\nhow he happened to be naked.\r\n\r\nThere is no telling what lightning will not do.\r\n\r\nSometimes it will snatch things out of your hand and carry them right\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThere is a case of a mug being thus spirited away from a man, who had\r\njust been drinking out of it, and deposited undamaged in a courtyard\r\nnear--the man himself suffering no injury. A youth of eighteen,\r\nholding up a missal from which he is singing, has it torn out of his\r\nhands and destroyed. A whip is whisked out of a rider's hand. Two\r\nladies, quietly knitting, have their knitting-needles stolen. A girl\r\nwas sitting at her sewing-machine, a pair of scissors in her hand; a\r\nflash of lightning, and her scissors are gone and she is sitting _on_\r\nthe sewing-machine. A farmer's labourer is carrying a pitchfork on his\r\nshoulder; the lightning seizes it, carries it off fifty yards or so,\r\nand twists its two prongs into corkscrews.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1878, at Gien (Nievre), a woman while sprinkling her house\r\nwith holy water during a storm, saw her holy-water bottle smashed\r\nactually in her fingers by the lightning, which at the same time\r\nsmashed up the tiled pavement of the room.\r\n\r\nIn a church at Dancé (Loire) during vespers, one day in June, 1866, a\r\nflash of lightning killed the priest and all the congregation, knocked\r\nover the monstrance on the altar, and buried the Host in a heap of\r\n_débris_.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 1885, the cupola of the Javisy Observatory, which was not\r\nthen provided with a lightning conductor, was struck by lightning. An\r\nenormous piece of oak from _un angle de construction_ was torn to\r\nshreds, and one splinter was lodged in the hinge of a window behind\r\nthe _pivot_, in the part between the _pivot_ and the frame, hardly a\r\ntwenty-fifth of an inch apart, and this without breaking the glass.\r\n\r\nIn other cases lightning has been known to split men in two, almost as\r\nwith a huge axe. On January 20, 1868, this happened to a miller's\r\nassistant in a windmill at Groix. The lightning struck him, and split\r\nhim from his head downwards in two.\r\n\r\nIn the course of July, 1844, four inhabitants of Heiltz-le-Maurupt,\r\nnear Vitry-le-Françoise, took refuge under trees during a storm, three\r\nof them under a poplar, and the fourth under a willow, against which\r\ndoubtless he leaned. In a few minutes this one was struck by\r\nlightning. A bright flame was observed to be issuing from his clothes,\r\nbut he remained standing, and seemed unconscious of what had happened.\r\n\"You're on fire! You're on fire!\" exclaimed his friends. Getting no\r\nreply, they went up to where he was, and found to their horror that he\r\nwas a corpse.\r\n\r\nA clergyman named Butler was a witness of the following incident,\r\nwhich took place at Everdon. Ten harvest-men took refuge under a lodge\r\non the approach of a storm. There was a thunderclap, and in a moment\r\nfour of them were killed by lightning. One of them was found dead,\r\nstill holding between finger and thumb a pinch of snuff he had been in\r\nthe act of taking. A second had one hand upon the head of a small dog,\r\nalso killed, and still sitting upon his knees, and in the other hand a\r\npiece of bread; a third was sitting, his eyes open, facing in the\r\ndirection from which the storm came.\r\n\r\nAt Castellane, in August, 1898, during a violent storm, a flock of\r\nsheep was struck by lightning while crossing the mountain of Peyresy.\r\nSeventy-five of them were killed. The shepherd escaped. The sheep\r\nprobably were all wet from the rain, and clinging together in one\r\ngreat mass. In the same month a pond at Vauxdîmes (Côte-d'Or) was\r\ndemolished, and all the fish in it killed.\r\n\r\nQuite recently, a young man at Franxault (Côte-d'Or) was killed by\r\nlightning on his way home from work. All the nails were found to have\r\nbeen torn out of his shoes, and the links of his silver watch-chain\r\nwere all moulded together. To fuse silver in this way a heat of 957\r\ndegrees is needed!\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 1883, at Buffon (Côte-d'Or), a woman had one of her\r\nearrings melted in the same way, but she was not killed. On the same\r\nday at Void (Meuse) two workmen, who had taken shelter under a willow,\r\nwere thrown a distance of four yards without being killed.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, of the same year, at Chanvres (Yonne), a vine-dresser\r\nwas struck by lightning and killed, but his heart continued to beat\r\nfor thirty hours.\r\n\r\nDr. Gaultier de Claubry was struck by lightning, with the\r\nextraordinary result that his beard was taken off him, roots and all,\r\nso that it never grew again.\r\n\r\nAt Fresneaux (Oise), a young girl of twenty, Mlle. Laure Leloup, had\r\nher head shorn by lightning. A wide furrow was to be traced on the\r\ncrown of her head, caused by the electric fluid. Her hair was removed\r\nright down to the skin as though by a razor.\r\n\r\nOn September 4, 1898, a flash of lightning lit up all the electric\r\nlamps in the Prefecture of Lyon.\r\n\r\nReally it is extraordinary the queer things lightning will do! Death\r\nin one case, an innocent practical joke in another! I have hundreds of\r\nquaint records before me. Impossible to deduce any kind of law from\r\nthem all. You are tempted to believe that the electric current has a\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nA young woman was picking cherries off a rather tall cherry-tree. A\r\nyoung man stood underneath. The young woman was struck by lightning,\r\nand fell dead. This was in July, 1885.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1898, at Remaines, near Ramerupt (Aube), a certain M.\r\nFinot, an innkeeper, was standing on his doorstep looking out at a\r\nstorm, when a flash of lightning followed by a thunderclap sent him\r\nflying back into the hall. He remained unconscious for a time, and\r\nhis sight was affected for ten hours. The extraordinary thing,\r\nhowever, in his case was that he had been a victim of rheumatism until\r\nthen, and walked with difficulty and only with a stick, and that ever\r\nsince this occurrence he has been able to do without the stick, and to\r\npursue his avocations quite comfortably. He feels that he has no\r\nreason to regret his experience, though he is not anxious to go\r\nthrough anything of the kind again. This kind of electrical phenomenon\r\nmight be catalogued under the title \"Medicinal Lightning.\"\r\n\r\nNow for a case of \"Judicial Lightning.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 20, 1872, a negro named Norris was hanged in the State of\r\nKentucky for having killed a mulatto, a fellow-workman of his. At the\r\nmoment of his setting foot upon the scaffold, there was a terrible\r\nclap of thunder, and the condemned man was struck dead by lightning.\r\nThe sheriff was so much moved by the occurrence that he resigned his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nLet us wind up this little collection of strange cases with another\r\noccurrence reported from the United States.\r\n\r\nAn immense grange had been built by a man named Abner Millikan, an\r\nardent republican, who adorned the front walls of his farm with\r\nportraits of MacKinley and Hobart. During a violent storm that broke\r\nout, the building was struck by lightning several times, and it\r\nlooked as though it were enveloped in great sheets of flame. Millikan,\r\nwho had been at some distance from the spot, rushed thither much\r\nalarmed, and found to his relief that no damage had been done. The\r\nportraits alone had been destroyed, and--here is the strange\r\ndetail--the lightning had traced the politicians' features upon the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nCertainly lightning plays queer pranks. And I have said nothing yet of\r\nthe photographs lightning sometimes takes.\r\n\r\n_Pranks_ they seem to us, but we may be sure there is some method in\r\ntheir mischievousness. It is the same with women. Women in their\r\ncaprices are but obeying some law of nature. They are not so\r\ncapricious as they seem.\r\n\r\nThese strange facts teach us, anyway, not for the first time, that our\r\nknowledge of the universe is still very incomplete, and that its study\r\nis worth following up in all its chapters.\r\n\r\nWe may be certain that electricity exercises a much more important\r\ninfluence in nature than is generally supposed, and that it plays a\r\n_rôle_ in our own lives which is still practically unrecognized. In\r\nthe oppression we feel before the coming of a storm, and the sense of\r\nrelief we experience when it has passed, we have an instance of the\r\nway in which physical and moral influences are apt to blend or\r\noverlap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY AND STORM-CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith such strange facts before us--facts the strangeness and diversity\r\nof which baffle all hypotheses and forbid all definite conclusions--we\r\ncan but keep adding to our observations and accumulating other facts\r\nwhich may tend to elucidate the mystery. The terrible ravages caused\r\nevery year by lightning make it necessary for us to find some means of\r\npreventing the recurrence of certain memorable catastrophes. It is\r\nonly in the actual investigation of the phenomenon, in the study of\r\nall its smallest manifestations, that we can hope to discover the\r\nmethods of the mysterious power.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times mankind has devoted much thought to the\r\nsubject. If we glance back towards past centuries we find that thunder\r\nand lightning have ever been regarded as a terrible agent of the will\r\nof the powers above.\r\n\r\nThe strongest and subtlest brains of antiquity, Anaxagoras, Aristotle,\r\nSeneca, were unable to form any kind of reasonable view regarding the\r\nfantastic phenomena resulting from the force of nature and held so\r\nmysterious to us moderns. Thunder and lightning were generally\r\nbelieved by them to be due to emanations from the earth or to vapours\r\ncontained in the air.\r\n\r\nThe Etruscans, who flourished fifteen hundred years before Christ, and\r\nwho were much given to the study of nature, are said to have observed\r\nthe tendency of lightning to make for points, but no theory upon the\r\nsubject has come down to us from them.\r\n\r\nElectricity for the ancients was an unplumbed ocean, whose slightest\r\nfluctuations affected them in ways they could not understand. In vain\r\nthey appealed to their gods to help them to explain the enigma.\r\nOlympus turned a deaf ear to their prayers.\r\n\r\nTheir imagination exhausted itself in researches into the nature of\r\nsuch things as amber, in which they recognized the curious attribute\r\nof attraction and repulsion for objects of slight weight. The poets\r\nattributed it to the tears of Phaëton's sisters, lamenting over the\r\ndreams of Eridan. Certain naturalists regarded it as a kind of gum\r\nissuing from trees during the dry days. No one gave any thought to\r\nelectricity, by whose subtle fluid the earth and everything upon it is\r\npenetrated and enveloped.\r\n\r\nThe superstitions connected with lightning would furnish forth\r\nmaterial in themselves for a very curious volume of stories--half\r\ncomic, half tragic.\r\n\r\nWith the Romans the fall of a thunderbolt was always taken as an omen.\r\nIn the reign of Domitian, thunder was to be heard once so constantly\r\nduring a period of eight months that the tyrant, frightened by the\r\nbombardment from on high, at last cried out in his terror: \"Let the\r\nblow come, then, where it will!\" The stroke fell upon the capitol, and\r\nupon the temple of the Flavian family, as well as upon the emperor's\r\npalace and the very room in which he slept. The inscription beneath\r\nthe triumphal statue was even torn away by the tempest and thrown into\r\na neighbouring garden.\r\n\r\nOtto de Guérike, burgomaster of Magdeburg and inventor of the\r\nair-pump, was the first person to discover the means of producing the\r\nelectric spark, about 1650. About the same time, Dr. Wall, while\r\nwatching electricity being released from a roll of amber, noticed a\r\nspark and a sudden sharp report, suggestive of a minute flash of\r\nlightning, followed by a minute peal of thunder. The analogy was\r\nstriking. This discovery opened out a new horizon to physicists, and\r\nalmost immediately the feeble electric light produced by the hand of\r\nman came to be associated with the monstrous sheaves of fire let loose\r\nin space by unknown forces.\r\n\r\nL'Abbé Nollet, considered in the France of his time as an oracle in\r\nregard to natural philosophy, expressed himself as follows upon this\r\nsubject:--\"If some one, after comparing the phenomena, were to\r\nundertake to prove that thunder is in the hands of nature what\r\nelectricity is in ours, that those electrical wonders with which we\r\nare now able to make so much play are petty imitations of those great\r\nlightning effects which frighten us; that both result from the same\r\nmechanism; and if he could make it evident that a cloud produced by\r\nthe action of the winds, by heat, and by the mingling of exhalations,\r\nbears the same relation to a terrestrial object as an electrified body\r\nbears to an unelectrified body in its close proximity, I admit that\r\nthe idea, if well worked out, would captivate me greatly; and, to work\r\nit out, how many plausible arguments there are at the disposal of a\r\nman who is properly versed in electricity!\"\r\n\r\nThe invention of the Leyden jar in 1746, and Franklin's brilliant\r\ninvestigations, make these conjectures the more probable. Since then\r\nelectricity has gone ahead and become one of the most important\r\nbranches of modern natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nWhen Franklin demonstrated that the air is in a permanent condition of\r\nelectrification even when the sky is clear, people began to study not\r\nthunder alone but the general electrical state of the atmosphere. And\r\never since meteorological observatories have made it a practice to\r\nregister every day the degree and nature of atmospheric electricity by\r\nthe use of very ingenious instruments.\r\n\r\nBut the records obtained up till now leave us in doubt upon many\r\npoints. The subject is still full of new surprises.\r\n\r\nWhence come those masses of electricity which move about in the\r\nclouds, sometimes escaping from them in thunderclaps and causing such\r\ntremendous ravages upon this earth of ours? The evaporation of the sea\r\nis one of their principal causes.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is continually impregnated with electric effluvia which\r\nflow silently through the soil through the medium of all bodies,\r\norganized or not, attached to the earth's surface. Plants afford an\r\nespecially welcome pathway to this fluid. The green leaves you see\r\nrustling in the wind are often being traversed by electrical currents,\r\nluckily harmless, of precisely the same nature as those of the deadly\r\nlightning. On the other hand, the earth itself emits a certain\r\nquantity of electricity, and it is from the attraction exerted by\r\nthese two fluids upon each other that thunder comes into existence. To\r\nput it in another way, thunder is a sudden striking of a balance\r\nbetween two different masses of electricity.\r\n\r\nMinute researches have established the fact that in ordinary\r\nconditions the terrestrial globe is charged with resinous, or negative\r\nelectricity, while the atmosphere holds in suspension _vitrée_, or\r\npositive electricity.\r\n\r\nIn two words, our planet and its aerial envelope are two great\r\nreservoirs of electricity, between which take place continual\r\nexchanges which play a _rôle_ in the life of plants and animals\r\ncomplementary to that which is played by warmth and moisture.\r\n\r\nThe aurora borealis, which sometimes illumines, with a brilliancy as\r\nof fairyland, the darkness of night in the Arctic and all the regions\r\nof the North, finds its explanation in the same phenomenon. It also is\r\na striking of a balance, silent but visible, between two opposing\r\ntensions of the atmosphere and the earth; thus the apparition of the\r\naurora borealis in Sweden or Norway is accompanied by electric\r\ncurrents moving through the earth to a distance sufficiently great to\r\ncause the magnetic needle to record the occurrence in the Paris\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the electricity which pervades the earth, silently and\r\ninvisibly, is identical with that which moves in the heights of the\r\nenveloping atmosphere, and, whether it be positive or negative, its\r\nessential unity remains the same, these qualities serving only to\r\nindicate a point, more or less in common, between the different\r\ncharges. The heights of the atmosphere are more powerfully electrified\r\nthan the surface of the globe, and the degree of electricity increases\r\nin the atmosphere with the distance from the earth.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric electricity undergoes, like warmth, and like atmospheric\r\npressure, a double fluctuation, yearly and daily, as well as\r\naccidental fluctuations more considerable than the regular ones. The\r\nmaximum comes between six and seven in the morning in summer, and\r\nbetween ten and twelve in winter; the minimum comes between five and\r\nsix in the afternoon in summer, and about three in the afternoon in\r\nwinter. There is a second maximum at sunset, followed by a diminution\r\nduring the night until sunrise. This fluctuation is connected with\r\nthat of the hygrometric condition of the air. In the annual\r\nfluctuation the maximum comes in January, and the minimum in July; it\r\nis due to the great atmospherical circulation; the winter is the time\r\nwhen the equatorial currents are most active in our hemisphere, and\r\nwhen the aurora borealis is to be seen most often.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the water of oceans and rivers is continually\r\nevaporating under the influence of solar heat, and rises into the\r\natmosphere, where it remains in the form of an invisible gaseous\r\nvapour. Soon it becomes cold again, and, in the process of\r\ncondensation, transparent gaseous molecules become transformed into\r\nminute drops, which accumulate into a cloud.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, clouds are, like the atmosphere, charged with\r\npositive electricity. Sometimes, however, there are negative clouds.\r\nYou may frequently see, on the summits of mountains, clouds which seem\r\nto cling to the peaks for a while, as though drawn to them by some\r\nforce of attraction, and then move away to follow the general\r\ndirection of the winds. It often happens that in this case the clouds\r\nhave lost their positive electricity in thus coming in contact with\r\nthe mountains, and have derived from them in its place the negative\r\nelectricity which, instead of holding them, has a tendency to drive\r\nthem off. A mass of clouds lying between the negative earth and a mass\r\nof positive clouds above is almost neutral; the positive electricity\r\naccumulates towards its lower surface, and the first drops of rain\r\nwill make it disappear. This mass will, from that moment, become like\r\nthe surface of the soil--that is to say, it will become negative under\r\nthe influence of the mass above it, endowed with a strong positive\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\nThe cloud remains suspended in space until the moment when, under the\r\ninfluence of the ambient medium, it dissolves in rain.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the instability of clouds are very numerous. My readers\r\nare aware that the atmosphere is being constantly agitated by vast\r\ncurrents which pass from the equator to the poles, and from which the\r\ndifferent winds result.\r\n\r\nThe clouds take part in this universal whirl of atmospheric waves.\r\nTransported from one point to another--often far beyond the region\r\nwhere they came into existence--subjected to every vicissitude of\r\natmosphere, and blown about by contrary currents, they follow the\r\ngigantic movements which take the form sometimes of cyclones and\r\ntempests.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of warmth, and probably also by its\r\ntransformation, these movements engender great masses of electricity,\r\nand presently, when the clouds have become saturated with it, the\r\nelectricity breaks out, and there is a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nThe electric fluid, escaped from the cloud in which it has been\r\nimprisoned, flies to unite itself, either with the negative\r\nelectricity stored in the surface of the earth, or else with the\r\nelectricity in other neighbouring clouds. Almost always the cloud torn\r\nopen by the electric discharge dissolves in rain or hail.\r\n\r\nThus a storm is the outcome of violent movements produced by the force\r\nof electricity when this has reached its maximum of intensity.\r\nThunderstorms are generally heralded by certain premonitory signs. The\r\nbarometer goes down steadily. The air, calm and heavy, is pervaded by\r\na bitter sulphurous odour. The heat is stifling. An abnormal silence\r\nreigns over the land. All this has a remarkable effect upon certain\r\norganisms, and produces nervous complaints, a buzzing in the ears, a\r\nsense of painful oppression, a sort of good-for-nothingness that we\r\ncombat in vain.\r\n\r\nIn most cases storms come to us in France ready made, so to speak,\r\nfrom the sea, borne in by the currents from the south-west; they are\r\nthe off-shoots of the cyclones, and are born in the tropics, moving in\r\nlines from the south-west to the north-east. Ordinarily they lose part\r\nof their strength _en route_ and come to an end suddenly with us.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, home-made storms also, so to speak, especially\r\nin France during our hot summers, when the sun is shining all the day,\r\nand thus promoting the rapid evaporation of our seas and rivers.\r\n\r\nThe air is charged with a heavy mist which veils the horizon; the\r\nbarometer is going down, the thermometer going up. The sun looks\r\nleaden though there are no clouds. When it approaches the meridian and\r\nits rays are most scorching, columns of vapour ascend and become\r\ncondensed into the light clouds termed _cirri_. At the end of some\r\nhours these clouds become attracted to each other, descend a little,\r\nand become grouped together into what look like great masses of\r\ncotton-wool. These are termed _cumuli_. Presently a small grey cloud\r\njoins the others. It looks innocent and harmless, but very often this\r\nis the beginning of the battle. First there ensues, perhaps, a\r\ndischarge or two of lightning without casualties, but soon the\r\nbombardment becomes general, and long blinding fusillades flash\r\nthrough space. The heavens, darkened over, seem to have sunk quite\r\nlow, and to have become a great black mass, from which the lightning\r\nescapes in sudden jets. Rain and hail pelt down upon the earth to an\r\naccompaniment of the rumbling of thunder. Confusion has fallen upon\r\nthe entire universe.\r\n\r\nThen, finally, the fight comes to a close. The clouds disperse and\r\nallow us to see once again a wide expanse of sunlit blue. The birds,\r\ntheir hearts freed again from terror, begin to sing again. Flowers and\r\nfoliage and soil, refreshed by the rain, give out sweet perfumes. An\r\nimmense joy takes the place of the sense of melancholy and oppression.\r\nIt is good to see the sun again! Alas, though, there are grim\r\nrealities to be faced presently. The hailstones have destroyed the\r\ncrops and begotten famine--the lightning has sown death and plunged\r\nwhole families into mourning. It is with these misfortunes before us\r\nthat we make up our minds to do what in us lies to diminish the\r\ndestructiveness of this terrible force.\r\n\r\nHow are storm-clouds to be detected?\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, their shape is very clearly defined, and they have\r\na look of solidity about them.\r\n\r\nTheir lower surface is often unbroken, presenting a level plain from\r\nwhich there rise huge ragged protuberances like great plumes.\r\nSometimes, on the other hand, they have great projections underneath,\r\ntrailing quite near the ground.\r\n\r\nStorm-clouds move generally in large numbers, and are generally\r\ncomposed of two separate masses, differently electrified--the lower\r\none giving out negative electricity, the higher positive electricity.\r\nThe flashes of lightning occur generally between these two masses,\r\nthough also, less frequently, between the lower mass and the earth.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that, generally speaking, storms are the result of the\r\nmeeting of two masses of clouds differently electrified.\r\n\r\nFor long, physicists refused to admit the validity of any other\r\ntheory, and combated in particular the idea that lightning could issue\r\nfrom a single isolated cloud.\r\n\r\nThis has, however, been established now as a fact, and in such cases\r\nthe flashes have always, of course, taken place between the cloud and\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nMarcorelle, of Toulouse, reports that on September 12, 1747, the sky\r\nbeing then pure and cloudless but for one round speck, there was\r\nsuddenly a thunderclap and a flash which killed a woman on the spot,\r\nburning her breast but doing no damage to her clothes.\r\n\r\nHere is another interesting case. Two priests of the Cathedral of\r\nLombey, who were standing in the area of their chapter-house, busy\r\nwinnowing, saw a small cloud approaching them little by little. When\r\nit was immediately above them a flash of lightning broke out and\r\nstruck a tree just beside them, splitting it from top to bottom. They\r\nheard no thunderclap. The weather was quite fine. There was no wind,\r\nand this was the only cloud in the sky.\r\n\r\nStorms are far more prevalent in some countries than in others.\r\nAccording to Pliny, thunder was unknown in Egypt, and, according to\r\nPlutarch, in Abyssinia. This could not be said now, however, perhaps\r\nbecause these lands have grown unworthy of their exemption. It might\r\nbe said, however, of Peru, whose pure and limpid skies are never\r\ntroubled by tempest. _Jupiter tonans_ must be a myth indeed to a\r\npeople who know nothing of thunderclaps or wet days.\r\n\r\nStorms diminish in number in high latitudes, but there are local\r\nconditions which affect their distribution. Then they are particularly\r\nfrequent in countries that are thickly wooded and in mountainous\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nArago came to the conclusion, after a considerable number of\r\nobservations, that, out in the open sea or among islands, there is no\r\nthunder in the north beyond the 75th degree of latitude. This is not\r\nabsolutely so, but it is a fact that storms are very much rarer in the\r\npolar regions. They become more and more frequent towards the equator,\r\nand are very numerous in the tropics.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the equator storms come year after year with\r\nremarkable regularity in the wet season, and at the time of the\r\nmonsoons.\r\n\r\nAt Guadeloupe and Martinique there is never any thunder in December,\r\nJanuary, February, or March.\r\n\r\nIn temperate climates there are scarcely any storms in winter; they\r\nbegin in the spring, and attain their maximum of intensity in the heat\r\nof summer.\r\n\r\nIn Italy there are thunderstorms at almost all times of the year.\r\n\r\nIn Greece they come chiefly in spring and autumn.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that in all latitudes they come most often in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FLASH AND THE SOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Romans attributed a mysterious influence to each manifestation of\r\nelectricity. They divided lightning into individual and family\r\nlightning, lightning of advice, monitory, explanatory, expostulatory,\r\nconfirmatory, auxiliary, disagreeable, perfidious, pestiferous,\r\nmenacing, murderous, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThey adapted it to every taste and circumstance, but modern science\r\nhas come to put order into this Capharnaum.\r\n\r\nWhen a cloud is superabundantly charged with electricity, this\r\nelectricity, which is compressed in the cloudy envelope, tries to\r\nescape in order to join the electricity accumulated either in another\r\ncloud or on the ground. An electric deflagration ensues, and a long\r\nignited dart precipitates itself into space, showing us on a large\r\nscale what our experience of physics has taught us in a small way in\r\nour laboratories. This luminous and often dazzling trail constitutes\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nLightning is not always the same, and in order to classify the\r\ndifferent forms it takes more easily, it can be divided into three\r\ngroups--diffused lightning, linear lightning, and fireballs. This last\r\nis the most curious of the three. The variety and eccentricity of\r\nfireballs are celebrated in the history of lightning, and I propose to\r\ndevote the following chapter to their vagaries.\r\n\r\nDiffused lightning is the commonest of all. You can count hundreds of\r\nflashes on a stormy night. Occasionally they succeed one another with\r\nsuch rapidity that the sky is momentarily entirely illumined with a\r\nfantastic brightness. At these times great sombre clouds can be seen\r\nsurging from the darkness of the night, to shine suddenly with an\r\nephemeral brightness of a diffused red, blue, or violet tinge. Their\r\nirregular shapes, with their jagged edges of light, are visible\r\nagainst the dark background of the heavens, and the thunder growls\r\nmonotonously. Whether the exchange of electricity is produced on a\r\nvast stretch between two rows of clouds, or whether it is manifested\r\nby a long thin spark launched like an arrow and veiled by the curtain\r\nof clouds, all that can be seen is a strange light, vague, diaphanous,\r\ninstantaneous, which sometimes spreads itself like a sheet of fire all\r\nover the horizon.\r\n\r\nIt is diffused lightning which gives us the finest storm effects on\r\nthose heavy summer evenings when the air is breathless and saturated\r\nwith electricity. Suddenly the clouds are illumined, nebulous veils\r\nof light on which can be seen, in sombre fantastic, fugitive vision,\r\nthe outlines of the trees, houses, and other landmarks. Then, all at\r\nonce, heaven and earth fall back into a darkness deeper than before,\r\nowing to the contrast.\r\n\r\nLinear lightning is more terrible. It is regarded by astronomers as\r\nthe most perfect form of destructive lightning. It is a strong\r\nflash--a thin trail of light--very clear, and extraordinarily rapid,\r\nwhich shoots from an electric cloud to the earth, or from one cloud to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nLike a supple and undulating serpent of fire, it twists itself\r\nluminously into space, spreading itself menacingly in the heavens with\r\nits long spirals of light.\r\n\r\nSometimes--in a hurry, no doubt, to reach its prey--it effects its\r\npassage in a straight line, but as a rule it follows a sinuous track,\r\nand forms itself into a zigzag at an obtuse angle. The different forms\r\nwhich this lightning takes are no doubt attributable to various\r\ncauses. One of the chief of these seems to be the unequal distribution\r\nof humidity in the air, which renders it a more or less good\r\nconductor. In fact, fulminic matter is strongly attracted towards damp\r\nregions, and goes quickly from one point to another, guided in its\r\nchosen way by the hygrometrical conditions of the atmosphere; and it\r\nis these constant changes of direction which determine the meanderings\r\nof its course. Thus the lightning would trace a sort of plan of the\r\nhygrometrical state of the air for a certain portion of the\r\natmosphere. For it, the short road is hardly ever the straight line.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the variability of the overloading of electricity\r\nhas something to say to the form it takes.\r\n\r\nSometimes lightning forms itself into two or three branches, and\r\nbecomes forked lightning. Or it even divides itself into a number of\r\npoints from a principal branch, out of which a great many sparks burst\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nThese incandescent sheaves move through space with extraordinary\r\nagility. It has not been possible to measure their speed with absolute\r\naccuracy, but their rapidity is such that their transit appears to be\r\ninstantaneous. The latest researches seem to have proved that their\r\nspeed is superior to that of light, which is 300,000 kilometres a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nLightning is not always of a dazzling whiteness, it is often yellow,\r\nred, blue, violet, or green. Its colour depends on the quantity of the\r\nelectricity thrown on the atmosphere by the discharge; on the density\r\nof the air at the time of the passage of the ignited matter; on its\r\nhygrometrical state, and on the substances which it contains during\r\nsuspension. It has been remarked in the study of physics that the\r\nelectric spark is white in the open air, but that it gets a violet\r\ntinge in the vacuum of a pneumatic machine.\r\n\r\nThis proves that violet lightning comes from the far-off regions of\r\nthe atmosphere. It traverses a bed of rarified air, and shows the\r\ngreat height of the storm-clouds from which it emanates.\r\n\r\nThe fulminating spark is so fugitive that it is difficult to form an\r\nidea of its length. One could easily take it to be a yard or so long,\r\nso illusory and deceptive are our impressions. As a matter of fact, it\r\nis proved that flashes of lightning cover a distance of several\r\nkilometres.\r\n\r\nThere are various methods to which one can have recourse in these\r\nscientific researches. The first, which gives the length of horizontal\r\nlightning, is based on a minute comparison between the trajectory\r\ndescribed by the meteor and the known distance of the terrestrial\r\npoints between which it travels. In order to gauge the extent of\r\nvertical lightning, you must estimate approximately the height of the\r\nclouds from which it comes, based on the irregularities of the earth\r\nof which the height is known.\r\n\r\nBut there is a still simpler method for approximate measurement within\r\nthe reach of every one. It consists in multiplying 337 (the number of\r\nyards traversed by sound in a second) by the number of seconds during\r\nwhich the thunder lasts.\r\n\r\nThese methods all give the same result, and prove that lightning is\r\noften 1, 5, and 10 kilometres in length. The greatest length proved up\r\nto the present has been 18 kilometres. When one thinks of the\r\ninstantaneousness of these flashes, one marvels at their incomparable\r\nagility, and we can only be lost in admiration of the magic force of\r\nthe heavenly sling, which is capable of hurling these whole rivers of\r\nfire to roll in their sinuous course right through space, and in a\r\nspace of time almost inappreciable to our senses.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of the extreme rapidity of the lightning, it has been\r\npossible to determine that these meteors do not last the thousandth\r\npart of a second. To prove this, we take a circle of cardboard,\r\ndivided from the middle into black and white sections. This circle can\r\nbe turned like a wheel almost as quickly as one can wish. We know that\r\nluminous impressions remain on the retina the tenth part of a second;\r\nthus, if we imitate the childish game of turning a lighted coal--if\r\nthe turn is made in the tenth of a second, each successive position of\r\nthe coal remaining impressed on the retina for the same length of\r\ntime--we have a continuous circle. In turning our cardboard wheel with\r\nthe black and white spokes, if each spoke passes before our eyes in\r\nless than the tenth of a second, we can no longer distinguish between\r\nthe sections, but can only see a grey circle. But we can make it\r\nrotate a hundred turns or more in a second; this being done, if we\r\ncontinue to observe the circle, we can no longer see the lines, they\r\nsucceed each other more quickly in our eyes than the impression they\r\nproduce. But if the circle turns before us in the darkness, and it is\r\nsuddenly lighted up and as suddenly darkened, the impression produced\r\non our eyes by each of the sections would last less than the tenth of\r\na second, and the circle would appear to us as if it were stationary.\r\nIn applying a calculated rotation to this contrivance, Charles\r\nWheatstone has proved that some lightning does not last the thousandth\r\npart of a second. This measure is probably a minimum; in the majority\r\nof cases the duration of lightning is longer than this.\r\n\r\nOften during the hot, transparent summer nights, we see a considerable\r\nnumber of flashes, which furrow the firmament with their gentle,\r\nbluish light. These fugitive gleams remind us in the sky of the\r\nwill-o'-the-wisps, which come forth silently from marshy ground. The\r\natmosphere is pure; there are no apparent traces of a storm, and yet\r\nthe sky is glistening with thousands of small flames. The flashes\r\nsucceed one another almost without interruption. These electric\r\nsparks are known as heat-lightning, but this is quite inaccurate, and\r\nhas no meaning in the language of modern science.\r\n\r\nIn a great number of cases an astronomer would be able to discover\r\ncertain characteristic signs indicating that a storm is taking place\r\nunder the horizon at a very great distance from the point of\r\nobservation. It is only at the moment when the sky is lighted up that\r\none can see the ridge of clouds lying low on the horizon. At other\r\ntimes there is no sign of a storm, as far as the eye can see. The\r\natmosphere is quite clear, and yet the sky is swept with a number of\r\nelectric flashes. But afterwards you hear that a violent storm has\r\ndevastated the region over which the gleams have appeared, and that it\r\nis to this that they are attributable. They are only reflected lights.\r\n\r\nA sailor tells us that once when he was out at sea, more than 100\r\nkilometres from Lima, he saw a number of bright flashes, without any\r\nthunder, to the east and north-east of the horizon. The weather was\r\nperfect, and the sky absolutely serene. Now we know that storms, and\r\nthe electric phenomena which they produce, are unknown upon that\r\ncoast; but this immunity does not extend for more than 100 kilometres\r\nto the interior of this country, so that this lightning which was\r\nobserved at sea, 100 kilometres from the shore, must have taken place\r\nmore than 200 kilometres away.\r\n\r\nOne of our correspondents, M. Soleyre of Constantine, sent us word, in\r\n1899, of an interesting case of lightning without thunder.\r\n\r\n\"In August,\" he says, \"I noticed it in the valley of the Arve above\r\nSalambes; when I came back to Algiers I saw it again on September 16,\r\nand on October 19.\r\n\r\n\"It was not sheet lightning, but ordinary lightning concentrated in\r\nvery thin lines. This lasted long, and was very near. Another thing,\r\nthere was no hail. This is not very rare in Algiers.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 1, 1901, I happened to be in Geneva at about 6 p.m. The\r\nweather was heavy but very fine. I noticed a good deal of lightning on\r\nthe south-west of the horizon. It went on almost without interruption\r\nabove the Savoy Alps. Each flash illuminated at the same time the\r\nridge of the mountains and the fringed edge of the great sombre clouds\r\nlying low on the horizon. This lightning was silent; the noise of the\r\nthunder did not reach Geneva. The next day I learnt that a terrible\r\nstorm had devastated the neighbourhood of Chambéry and Aix-les-Bains.\r\n\r\nMoreover, apart from storms, there have been other records of this\r\nlighting up of the sky being observed at great distances.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1803, a service of luminous communications was established on\r\nMount Brocken in the Hartz Mountains in order to determine the\r\ndifferences of longitude. The combustion of 180 to 200 grammes of\r\npowder, burnt in the open air, for each of the signals, produced a\r\nlight which was observed by astronomers stationed on Mount Kenlenberg,\r\nalthough they were 240 kilometres from Brocken, which is itself\r\ninvisible from Kenlenberg.\r\n\r\nOn certain fête-days, July 14, for example, when the principal\r\nmonuments in Paris are illuminated, at a distance of 20 and 30\r\nkilometres we can see a sort of luminous vapour which floats above the\r\ntown and reflects the lights of the boulevards, although the lights\r\nthemselves are invisible from the point of observation.\r\n\r\nHere is another example which any Parisian can verify: the captive\r\nballoon of the Aërodrome at Porte-Maillot, which soars some hundreds\r\nof yards above Paris during the spring and summer, as seen from the\r\ndark paths of the Bois de Boulogne, appears against the azure of the\r\nsky like a magnificent globe bathed in light, resembling an enormous\r\nmoon. Well, this gentle, pale light is only the reflection of the\r\nlights of Paris which are invisible from the Bois de Boulogne.\r\n\r\nThe earth and all the planets which are dark in themselves, shine in\r\nspace lighted up by the sun.\r\n\r\nThe silent lightning which flashes in the sky is only the reflection\r\nof a distant storm. Whether on account of the spherical shape of the\r\nearth or on account of the irregularities of the land, the clouds are\r\ninvisible, but the effluvium which escapes from them can be seen at a\r\ngreat distance.\r\n\r\nThese poetic and ephemeral flames which glide through the sky, appeal\r\nto the imagination of the dreamer, and yet they are quite as terrible\r\nas the flashes which are accompanied by thunder. If the noise which\r\naccompanies these is not perceptible, it is because the sound of the\r\nthunder does not carry far, and has been lost in space before reaching\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with the silent lightning which gleams in a stormy sky.\r\nThis phenomenon is particularly frequent in the Antilles. Either the\r\nstorm breaks too far from the observer, or the discharge has taken\r\nplace between two beds of clouds, the lower of which intercepts the\r\nwaves of sound without preventing the escape of the electric spark,\r\nand the thunder is not heard.\r\n\r\nAs a rule we imagine that lightning always descends, that it comes to\r\nus from the higher celestial regions to be lost in the common\r\nreservoir. But this is quite inaccurate. Lightning sometimes ascends.\r\nSometimes it descends and reascends. That is to say, after it reaches\r\nthe ground, either there is no attraction there, or a stronger force\r\ndraws it back to the aerial regions, and it flies back to the clouds\r\nwhence it came.\r\n\r\nAs a rule we only fear the direct lightning. This is a great mistake.\r\nThere are many cases of lightning striking from a distance.\r\n\r\nFor example, at the end of May, 1866, an English coastguard was making\r\nhis rounds on the coast of one of the Shetland Isles, when a flash of\r\nlightning passed near him, striking a great rock. The unfortunate man\r\nwas completely blinded, and plunged into darkness thus suddenly, he\r\nwould inevitably have fallen down an abyss, if his companions,\r\nattracted by his cries, had not come to the rescue and taken him home.\r\n\r\nHere is another case:--\r\n\r\nOn September 24, 1826, a terrible storm burst over Versailles,\r\naccompanied by a great deal of thunder and lightning. At the moment\r\nwhen the lightning struck Galli's farm, an old man who was in a street\r\nin Versailles, at a distance of two kilometres from the farm, suddenly\r\nfelt a violent shock, accompanied by a feeling of oppression and\r\ngiddiness and a semi-paralysis of the tongue and the whole of his left\r\nside. Next morning this had passed away, but in the evening at the\r\nsame time as the shock had occurred, he felt similar sensations of\r\nfainting, and it was the same to the end of the week. It would be well\r\nto remark here that at the moment of the accident, M. B---- happened\r\nto be near the wall of a house, not far from the metallic tube which\r\nconducted the rain-water into the level of the pavement.\r\n\r\nThe following phenomenon, to which we have already alluded, is no less\r\ncurious:--\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1868, at about 7 o'clock in the evening, at Gien-sur-Cure\r\n(Nièvre), the thunder had been growling violently for some time, when\r\nall of a sudden the lightning struck a thatched house, which it set on\r\nfire. At the same time a woman who was in a house ten yards away, felt\r\na shock, and saw the tiled floor rise beneath her. Her two sabots were\r\nbroken on her feet, and a bottle of Holy Water with which she was\r\nblessing the house was broken in her hand, only the neck remained in\r\nher fingers. She herself suffered nothing but the shock. Nineteen of\r\nthe tiles were flung in all directions.\r\n\r\nHere is another very remarkable case of _ascending lightning_,\r\npublished in the _Comptes Rendus_ of the Academie des Sciences:--\r\n\r\nAt Porto-Alegre, on June 9, 1870, at 2 a.m., during a violent storm,\r\non the property of M. Laranja e Oliveira, at Brazil, a servant was\r\nentering the house; he was about ten yards away, when a flash of\r\nlightning illuminated it; at the same moment he felt a great tingling\r\nin the flesh of his feet, then in his legs, then all over his body,\r\nand finally in his head, on which the hair stood on end to such an\r\nextent that _he was obliged to hold his hat on_ in order to prevent\r\nits falling off. At the same time, a white flame burst from the ground\r\nabout two yards in front of him, accompanied by a shower of sparks.\r\nTerrified by such a phenomenon, which he attributed to souls from\r\nanother world, he thought he was petrified to the spot; finally, he\r\nran away. Anything metallic which he had about him at the time of this\r\noccurrence became magnetized. A key which was in his pocket remained\r\nmagnetic for two days.\r\n\r\nThus, as well as the ordinary fulguration, in which the lightning\r\n(which we imagine descends from the clouds) acts directly on the body,\r\nand the lightning which strikes indirectly, there are other electric\r\nshocks which can be experienced by men and animals. Notable among\r\nthese is the _striking from the earth_, commonly known as _choc de\r\nretour_, and which is in reality only an instance of the ascending\r\ncurrent, or of lightning striking from a distance. We must also\r\ndescribe the striking _by a man who has been struck_.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Richard, in his _Histoire de l'Air_, tells the following\r\nstory:--\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the village of Rumigny, in Picardy, on August\r\n20, 1769, at six o'clock in the morning, there was a sudden irruption\r\nof fulminating matter from the bosom of the earth in such quantities\r\nas to produce the most violent results. The sky was cloudy, and looked\r\nlike a storm. A young farmer and his wife were following, at some\r\ndistance, a vehicle drawn by four horses. Suddenly the driver of this,\r\n_without seeing the lightning or hearing the thunder_, was thrown to\r\nthe earth. His four horses were stretched dead on the ground near the\r\ncarriage. There was a _smoking hole_ in the ground, from which the\r\neffluvium came forth and killed the young man and his wife at ten\r\npaces off and separated from each other by twenty paces. The current\r\nalso knocked down, at a hundred paces, the father of the young man in\r\nthe same fashion as it had done the driver, but without injuring one\r\nor the other.\r\n\r\nThe bodies showed no signs of a wound, only a considerable swelling\r\nand a great deformity of the features. The woman, who was young and\r\npretty, became hideous; the whole of her body as well as that of her\r\nhusband was absolutely yellow. The four horses had their intestines\r\ndrawn from their bodies. They were all thrown on the same side. The\r\nman's hat was pierced and his hair burnt, but he had no bruise on his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThis account, in which we must not be surprised to find the ideas and\r\nlanguage of the time (let us observe in passing that the man who was\r\nstruck did not hear the thunder, and had not even time to see the\r\nlightning of which he was the victim)--this account, I say, gives us\r\nan instance of ascending lightning. Here is another.\r\n\r\nThe traveller Brydone gives the following example, which he himself\r\nobserved:--\r\n\r\nOn July 19, 1785, a storm burst near Coldstream between 12 and 1 a.m.\r\nA woman who was cutting hay on the banks of the Tweed _fell\r\nbackwards_. She at once called to her companions, and said she had\r\njust received a violent blow on her foot for which she could in no way\r\naccount. At the time there was no thunder or lightning in the sky. The\r\nshepherd of a farm at Lennel Hill saw a sheep fall near him, which a\r\nfew minutes before appeared to be in perfect health; he found it stone\r\ndead. The storm then appeared very far off. Two carts laden with coal,\r\nand each driven by a young driver seated on a small seat in front,\r\ncrossed over the Tweed. They had just climbed a small hill near the\r\nbanks of this river when they heard a great detonation round about,\r\nsimilar to that which would be produced by the discharge of several\r\nguns. At the same instant the driver of the second cart saw the first,\r\nwith his companion and the two horses, fall to the ground. _The driver\r\nand horses were stone dead. The ground was pierced with three circular\r\nholes at the very spot where the wheels had touched it when the\r\naccident happened._ Half an hour after this event the holes emitted an\r\nodour which Brydone compared to that of ether. The two circular iron\r\nbands which covered the felloes of the wheels showed evident signs of\r\nfusion in the two spots which rested on the ground at the moment of\r\nthe detonation, and in no other place. The skin of the horses had been\r\nburnt, particularly about the legs and under the stomach. The body of\r\nthe driver had marks of burning here and there. His clothes, his\r\nshirt, and, above all, his hat, were reduced to shreds, and gave out a\r\nstrong smell.\r\n\r\nOrioli gives an example of two men who were surprised by a violent\r\nstorm near the village of Benvenide. They lay down on the ground to\r\nlet the meteor pass. Some moments later one of them got up feeling\r\nvery tired, but the other was dead. The bones of the latter were so\r\nsoft that it was easy to bend them; his whole body was of the\r\nconsistency of paste. The tongue had been torn from the roots, and no\r\none knew what had become of it.\r\n\r\nNow, just as the earth can strike, so can the human body become\r\nfulminating and act like lightning. After having been struck, it can\r\neffectively acquire the power to strike in its turn.\r\n\r\nFor instance, on June 30, 1854, a man named Barri was killed by\r\nlightning near the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, and his body lay for\r\nsome time exposed to a beating rain. After the storm had passed, two\r\nsoldiers from the neighbouring guard-house tried to remove the body,\r\nand each received a violent blow when they touched it. They got off\r\nwith a shock, perhaps because the body had been drenched with rain,\r\nwhich acted as a conductor to the electricity, and thus it had had\r\ntime to lose a part of the fluid.\r\n\r\nWhat a mysterious world is that of atmospheric electricity! It is\r\ntruly the New World for the scientific mind--a mine, fruitful in\r\nunknown and even unsuspected marvels, which is perpetually disclosing\r\nits riches for our admiration.\r\n\r\nOne of our most valued collaborators in our researches on the nature\r\nof lightning is photography. Faithfully and unhesitatingly it\r\nregisters an indestructible document of the fugitive lightning, which\r\nimprints itself on the sensitized plate, and the astronomer can\r\nafterwards examine the smallest details of the sudden apparition\r\ncomfortably and at his leisure. We have already a considerable number\r\nof plates of the outline of the lightning in flight. An examination of\r\nthese electric pictures is very interesting.\r\n\r\nWho knows whether, later on, when phonography is brought to\r\nperfection, it will not also register the noisy accompaniment to the\r\nelectric flash? Then, with the help of the cinematograph, we could\r\nhave dramatic representations of sensational storms. While the\r\nphotograph unrolls all the phases of the lightning, from its emerging\r\nfrom the cloud to its fall to earth, before the gaze of the\r\nspectators, the phonograph will repeat the sonorous accents of the\r\nterrorizing voice of thunder.\r\n\r\nThunder, as all the world knows, is the noise which accompanies\r\nlightning. It is produced when a change of electricity--a\r\nneutralization--takes place between two points more or less distant.\r\nThe causes which provoke it are still somewhat of a mystery.\r\n\r\nThe luminous rocket which flings itself precipitately from a cloud\r\nsaturated with electricity, spreads itself like a trail of flames in\r\nthe atmosphere where an infinity of invisible molecules are floating;\r\nthese it repels. The passage of this whirlwind of fire in a centre\r\nwhich is greatly compressed produces a momentary void into which the\r\nsurrounding air at once rushes, and it is the same all the way along\r\nthe route followed by lightning.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the equilibrium of the atmosphere, which is\r\nmomentarily disturbed by the intrusion of the ignited matter, hastily\r\nre-establishes itself by a rush of the air which the lightning has\r\nejected, and which is swallowed up with a crash in the opening which\r\nhas been made. It is, on a large scale, a similar phenomenon to that\r\nwhich is produced by opening a case which has been hermetically\r\nsealed. The air rushing in makes a dull noise.\r\n\r\nPouillet objects to this very natural explanation on the ground that\r\nthe flight of a cannon-ball ought to produce a similar noise. But\r\nthis objection errs in its basis, because, as regards velocity, a\r\ncannon-ball is as a tortoise as compared with the arrow of lightning,\r\nand as regards size, who can compare a few grammes of powder to the\r\ntorrents of fire launched into space by the prodigious force of\r\nelectricity?\r\n\r\nThe lightning discharge produces a violent concussion in the cloud,\r\nand very often a shower of rain immediately follows it. The electric\r\nconditions of the different clouds which make a storm being separately\r\nliable the one to the other, the discharge of one must lead to that of\r\nseveral others more or less distant. In all cases the noise is caused\r\nby the expansion of the air where a more or less partial void has been\r\nmade. It is the same with firearms, _crève-vessie_, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief characteristics of thunder is the rolling, which is\r\noften prolonged, and reverberates on the sides of steep mountains.\r\nThis voice, with its lugubrious tone, becomes grave and sometimes\r\nsinister in the revolution of space--this voice, celestial and\r\ninfernal, seems to momentarily dominate the world, while the clouds\r\nare enveloped with a thousand diabolical flames. Sometimes it rings in\r\nthe air with fierce calls, at others it spreads itself in dull,\r\nlanguorous complaints.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the intenseness of thunder undergoes a thousand\r\nfluctuations, and presents astonishing variations. Generally it\r\nstrikes and frightens, but the curious thing is that, for the ear, in\r\nreality it is less strong than the crinkling noise of a piece of paper\r\ntorn close to it.\r\n\r\nOften, too, it may be compared to the discharge of firearms, a pistol\r\nor a cannon.\r\n\r\nThus, when the lightning penetrated Volney's apartments at Naples, the\r\npeople present, among whom was Saussure, had the impression of a\r\npistol-shot in the next room.\r\n\r\nThere is a case given of M. and Mme. Boddington, who were seated on\r\nthe back seat of their coach in order to enjoy the view of the\r\ncountry, and had given the inside seats to two servants. Suddenly\r\nthere was a flash of lightning, which struck M. and Mme. Boddington\r\nand flung the postillion to a great distance. The servants were\r\nuntouched, and escaped with a fright. When they got over their terror,\r\none of them said that a very brilliant flash of lightning had been\r\nimmediately followed by a noise similar to that of a heavily charged\r\nmusket. He thought some one had shot the horses. His fright had\r\nstunned him so that he hardly knew what had happened.\r\n\r\nAt other times thunder is accompanied by a whistling noise, but as a\r\nrule it is the rolling which predominates.\r\n\r\nWe ask ourselves to what it is due that this rolling lasts so long.\r\nThere are several causes. The first is due to the length of lightning\r\nand the difference in speed between sound and light. Let us suppose,\r\nfor example, a flash of lightning, AE, 11,000 metres long. The\r\nobserver stationed at O, underneath extremity E of the lightning\r\n(which is one kilometre high), will see the lightning in its full\r\nlength in one indivisible instant. The sound will form itself also at\r\nthe same instant all along the line of lightning, but the sound-waves\r\nwill only reach the ear of the observer at different times. That which\r\nstarts at point E, the nearest, will arrive in 3 seconds, sound\r\ntravelling about 337 metres a second. That which is formed at the same\r\nmoment at point D, 2000 yards from point O, will take double the time\r\nto arrive. That which comes from point C will not arrive for 12\r\nseconds. The sound formed at B will not arrive until the time\r\nnecessary to cover 8 kilometres--that is to say, not for 23\r\nseconds--and the sound formed at A will only reach after 32 seconds.\r\nThus the rolling will have lasted more than half a minute from start\r\nto finish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM EXPLAINING THE DURATION OF THE SOUND OF\r\nTHUNDER.]\r\n\r\nAnd if, which is very often the case, the astronomer is not exactly\r\nunder one of the extremities of the lightning, but at some other point\r\nin its course, he first hears a clap, then an increased noise, then a\r\ndiminution. In fact, in this case, the sound which leaves point D just\r\noverhead, which is 1000 metres off, arrives alone in 3 seconds, but\r\nthe sounds formed from D to E on one side, and from C to D on the\r\nother, arrive at the same time, having joined each other, taking 9\r\nseconds, which is the necessary time to come from 1000 to 3000 metres.\r\nThe sounds beyond C arrive and depart according to distance, as in the\r\npreceding example, and the thunder has lasted 23 seconds instead of 32\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMENCEMENT, AUGMENTATION, AND DIMINUTION OF THE\r\nINTENSITY OF THUNDER.]\r\n\r\nI must add that lightning is never straight, but always crooked.\r\n\r\nThe length of time the thunder rolls has nothing to do with the\r\ndistance of the cloud where the phenomenon begins. It is proportionate\r\nto the length of the lightning with which it is associated. The\r\nrolling is often still more prolonged by a succession of small\r\ndischarges, which follow each other very rapidly between the stormy\r\nclouds; by the zigzags and ramifications of the lightning caused by\r\nthe hygrometrical diversity of the different beds of air; by the\r\nechoes repeated by the mountains, the earth, the water, and the clouds\r\nthemselves--to all which must be added also the interferences caused\r\nby the encounter of the different systems of sound-waves.\r\n\r\nIts duration is extremely variable, however; it rarely exceeds 30\r\nseconds, though the noise may sometimes seem to last much longer, so\r\nthat an observation of this kind may have any value--one must take\r\ninto consideration the echo, and isolate a single clap from the series\r\nof discharges which take place in the bosom of the storm. The longest\r\nverified duration of a single discharge is 45 seconds. That is\r\ntremendous if we think of the instantaneousness of the lightning, and\r\nreflect that the flash and the sound are produced in reality at the\r\nsame moment, that they are dependent the one on the other, and that in\r\ntheir various manifestations there is only the difference of motion.\r\n\r\nSound moves like a tortoise behind the swift lightning, whose\r\nvibrations spread in the air with inconceivable rapidity.\r\n\r\nHence these 45 seconds correspond to a flash of lightning more than 15\r\nkilometres in length, but we know that there are even longer ones.\r\n\r\nI have already said that we can calculate the distance of the\r\ncelestial cannon from which the fulminating discharge comes by\r\ncounting the number of seconds which separate the apparition of the\r\nlightning from the first growls of the thunder. Thus the longest\r\ninterval that has been proved between the appearance of the lightning\r\nand the noise it produces is 24 kilometres. This, however, is a\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\nNumerous observations have proved that thunder is never heard beyond\r\n20 or perhaps 25 kilometres. Lightning pierces the cloudy veil, but\r\nthe voice of thunder does not carry so far. In this the great Jupiter\r\nshows himself inferior to the ingenuity of human pigmies, whose\r\ndestructive and barbarous art has been able to invent infernal\r\nmachines the noise of which can be heard much further.\r\n\r\nCannon can easily be heard at a distance of 40 kilometres. Sometimes,\r\nin sieges and big battles the cannonades can be heard muttering\r\nlugubriously more than 100 kilometres away.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Paris, Krupp's cannon--that most expeditious of\r\nall vehicles of civilization in the eyes of the statesmen of this\r\nplanet!--could be heard as far as Dieppe, 140 kilometres away, during\r\nthe nights when they were bombarding. The cannonade of March 30, 1814,\r\nwhich crowned the First Empire, as it crowned the Second, was heard\r\nbetween Lisieux and Caen, a distance of 175 kilometres. Arago even\r\nalleges that the cannon at Waterloo could be heard as far as Creil,\r\nwhich is 200 kilometres away. Thus man's thunder can be heard at a\r\ngreater distance than that of nature. It is true that it is\r\nincomparably more vicious, and that it has a great many more victims.\r\n\r\nIn its natural state, if we might explain it thus--left to itself--it\r\ncomes directly to us from the high regions of the atmosphere, and is\r\nthe most terrible of aerial messengers--a subtle messenger, malicious\r\nand violent, it is the terror of the human race. But ruled by the\r\ngenius of man, it becomes a powerful agent towards modern\r\ncivilization, and we cannot sufficiently admire its many advantages.\r\n\r\nIf we could tame lightning and guide it safely, its services would\r\nprobably become innumerable. Lightning as man's right hand! Why not?\r\nWas it not the auxiliary of the gods in the dark ages? To-day, is it\r\nnot regarded by astronomers as one of the most important forces of\r\nnature? Why should it not be the collaborator of man's intelligence\r\nto-morrow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFIREBALLS\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we penetrate into what is, perhaps, the most mysterious, and\r\ncertainly the least understood domain of thunder and lightning.\r\n\r\nAmong all the electrical phenomena to be observed in the atmosphere,\r\nthere is nothing stranger than those fireballs of which we have\r\nalready spoken, and which in form and size recall the electric lights\r\nin our Paris boulevards. Curious the contrast between electricity\r\ntamed and civilized and electricity running wild! Between the arc\r\nlights fulfilling their peaceful and useful function as substitutes\r\nfor the sun, and these dread engines of destruction sowing death and\r\nhavoc!\r\n\r\nIt is not long since the existence of these fireballs has been\r\nacknowledged by scientists as an actual fact. Until quite recent times\r\nthey were regarded as the figment of excited imaginations, and wise\r\nmen smiled at the wild stories of their ravages. Their reality has now\r\nbeen established, however, beyond the possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nIn shape they are not always quite spherical, though this is their\r\nnormal appearance; and although their contours are usually clearly\r\ndefined, they are sometimes encircled by a kind of luminous vapour,\r\nsuch as we often see encircling the moon. Sometimes they are furnished\r\nwith a red flame like a fuse that has been lit. Sometimes their course\r\nis simply that of a falling star. Sometimes they leave behind them a\r\nluminous trail which remains visible long after they themselves have\r\ndisappeared. They have been described as looking like a crouching\r\nkitten, an iron bar, a large orange--so harmless apparently, that you\r\nwere tempted to put out your hand to catch it. There is record of one\r\nbeing seen as large as a millstone.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable thing about them is the slowness with which they move,\r\nand which sometimes enables their course to be watched for several\r\nminutes. In our first chapter we gave several instances of the\r\noccurrence of fireballs. Let us look at some more. Here is one taken\r\nfrom Arago's learned treatise upon thunder. The record is from the pen\r\nof Batti, a marine painter in the service of the Empress of Austria\r\nand resident at Milan.\r\n\r\n\"In the month of June, 1841, I was staying at the Hôtel de l'Agnello\r\nin a room on the second floor, overlooking the Corso dei Servi. It was\r\nabout six in the afternoon. The rain was coming down in torrents, and\r\nthe darkest rooms were lit up by the lightning flashes better than our\r\nrooms generally are by gas. Thunder broke out every now and again with\r\nappalling violence. The windows of the houses were closed, and the\r\nstreets were deserted, for, as I have said, there was a steady\r\ndownpour, and the main road was turned into a torrent. I was sitting\r\nquietly smoking, and looking out at the rain, which an occasional ray\r\nof sunlight set flashing like threads of gold, when I suddenly heard\r\nvoices in the street calling out 'Guarda, guarda!'--'Look, look!' and\r\nat the same moment a clatter of hob-nailed boots. After half an hour\r\nof absolute silence, this noise attracted my attention. I ran to the\r\nwindow, and looking to the right, in the direction of the clamour, I\r\nsaw a fireball making its way down the middle of the road on a level\r\nwith my window, in a noticeably oblique direction, not horizontally.\r\nEight or ten persons, continuing to call out 'Guarda, guarda!' kept\r\npace with it, walking down the street, stepping out quickly. The\r\nmeteor passed my window, and I had to turn to the left to see what\r\nwould be the end of its caprice. After a moment, fearing to lose sight\r\nof it behind some houses which jutted out beyond my hotel, I went\r\nquickly downstairs and into the street, and was in time to see it\r\nagain and to join those who were following its course. It was still\r\ngoing slowly, but it was now higher up, and was still ascending--so\r\nmuch so that after a few minutes it hit the cross upon the clock tower\r\nof the Chiesa dei Servi and disappeared. Its disappearance was\r\naccompanied by a dull report like that of a big cannon twenty miles\r\naway when the wind carries the sound.\r\n\r\n\"To give an idea of the size and colour of this globe of fire, I can\r\nonly compare it to the appearance of the moon as one may see it\r\nsometimes rising above the Alps on a clear night in winter, and as I\r\nmyself have seen it at Innsbrück--that is to say, of a reddish yellow,\r\nwith patches on it almost of red. The difference was that you could\r\nnot see the contours of the meteor distinctly as you could the moon,\r\nand that it seemed to be enveloped in a luminous atmosphere of\r\nindefinite extent.\"\r\n\r\nThis fireball was an innocuous one. We may take next, by way of\r\ncontrast, the case of one which wreaked terrible damage and loss of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nOn July 27, 1789, at about three o'clock in the afternoon, a fireball\r\nof about the size of a cannon-ball, fell in a great hall at Feltri\r\n(Marche Trevisane) in which six hundred people were seated, wounded\r\nseventy and killed ten, putting out all the lights.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 1809, about eleven o'clock in the morning, a fireball\r\npenetrated into the church of Chateauneuf-les-Moustiers (Basses-Alpes)\r\njust as the bell was ringing and a large congregation had taken their\r\nseats. Nine persons were killed on the spot and eighty-two others were\r\nwounded. All the dogs that had got into the church were killed. A\r\nwoman who was in a hut on a neighbouring hill saw three fireballs\r\ndescend that day, and made sure they would reduce the village to\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nMüsschenbroek recounts the following incident which took place at\r\nSolingen in 1711. M. Pyl, the Pastor at Duytsbourg, was preaching one\r\nSunday, when in the middle of a storm a fireball fell into the church\r\nthrough the clock tower and exploded. The sanctuary was set on fire\r\nand became thick with smoke. Three persons were killed and more than a\r\nhundred were wounded.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Bulletin_ of the Société Astronomique de France the\r\nfollowing narrative contributed to it by Mlle. de Soubbotine, a member\r\nof this society, has been taken:--\r\n\r\n\"A terrible storm broke out at Ouralsk on May 22, 1901. It was a\r\n_fête_ day and the streets were thronged with people. Towards five in\r\nthe afternoon some young men and girls, twenty-one in all, had taken\r\nrefuge in the vestibule of a house, and a girl of seventeen, Mlle. K.,\r\nhad sat down on the threshold, her back turned towards the street.\r\nSuddenly there was a violent clap of thunder, and in front of the door\r\nthere appeared a dazzlingly brilliant ball of fire, gradually\r\ndescending towards where they were all grouped. After touching Mlle.\r\nK.'s head, who bowed down at once, the fireball fell on the ground in\r\nthe middle of the party, made a circuit of it, then forcing its way\r\ninto the room of the master of the house, whose boots it touched and\r\nsinged, it wreaked havoc with the apartment, broke through the wall\r\ninto a stove in the adjoining room, smashed the stove-pipe, and\r\ncarried it off with such violence that it was dashed against the\r\nopposite wall, and went out through the broken window.\r\n\r\n\"After the first feeling of fright, this is what transpired. The door\r\nnear which Mlle. K. was seated had been thrown back into the court,\r\nand in the ceiling there were two holes of about 18 centimetres each.\r\n\r\n\"The young girl, still seated with her head bowed down, looked as\r\nthough she were asleep. Some of the people were walking in the\r\ncourtyard, having seen and heard nothing, and the others were all\r\nlying in the vestibule in a dead faint. Mlle. K. was dead. The\r\nfireball had struck her on the nape of her neck and had proceeded down\r\nher back and left hip, leaving a black mark all along. There was a\r\nsore on one hand, with some blood on it, and one of her shoes was torn\r\ncompletely off, and there was a small hole in one of the stockings.\r\n\r\n\"All the victims became deaf.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 10, 1845, at about two in the afternoon, in the course of\r\na violent storm, a fireball came down the chimney into a room in a\r\nhouse in the village of Salagnac (Creuse). A child and three women who\r\nwere in the room suffered no harm from it. Then it rolled into the\r\nmiddle of the kitchen, and passed near the feet of a young peasant who\r\nwas standing in it. After which it went into an adjoining room, and\r\ndisappeared without leaving any trace. The women tried to persuade the\r\nman to go in and see whether he could not stamp it out, but he had\r\nonce allowed himself to be electrified in Paris, and thought it\r\nprudent to refrain. In a little stable hard by, it was found\r\nafterwards that the fireball had killed a pig. It had gone through the\r\nstraw without setting fire to it.\r\n\r\nOn July 12, 1872, a new form of fireball made its appearance in the\r\nCommune of Hécourt (Oise). It was of the size of an egg, and it was\r\nseen burning upon a bed. Efforts were made in vain to extinguish it,\r\nand presently the entire house, together with the neighbouring\r\ndwellings and barns, became a prey to the flames.\r\n\r\nOn October 9, 1885, at 8.25 p.m., during a violent storm, a globe of\r\nfire of the size of a small apple was seen coming into a ground-floor\r\nroom in a house at Constantinople through an open window, the family\r\nbeing at table in this room at the time. It first played round a\r\ngas-jet, then, moving towards the table, it passed between two guests,\r\nwent round a lamp hanging over the centre of the table, and then\r\nprecipitated itself into the street, where it exploded with an\r\nappalling crash, but without having caused any damage or hurt anybody.\r\nNot far from the scene of this phenomenon there are a number of\r\nbuildings provided with lightning conductors. The fireball left no\r\ntrace of smell behind it.\r\n\r\nHere is another curious narrative of a fireball.\r\n\r\nA party of five women took refuge during a storm in the entrance to a\r\nhouse in order to escape from the rain and the lightning.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely gained the doorway when there was a tremendous\r\nthunderclap which sent them flying backward--and two girls who had\r\njoined them--knocked senseless by lightning in the form of a fireball.\r\nOne of the girls remained unconscious for a long time; all the others\r\nwere more or less seriously injured, but all recovered. The strangest\r\ncircumstance in connection with this affair, however, still remains to\r\nbe told.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINGULAR CASE OF THREE FIREBALLS OBSERVED IN PARIS ON\r\nJUNE 10, 1905, BY M. H. RUDAUX.\r\n\r\nThey were seen to descend in this way upon the lightning conductor\r\nabove the Palais Royal electric-power station. This engraving, after a\r\nsketch made at the time by M. Rudaux, appeared in _La Science\r\nIllustrée_, for August, 1905.]\r\n\r\nOn the same side of the street as the passage, in a neighbouring\r\nhouse, nine or ten yards away, in a ground-floor room of which the\r\ndoor was shut, a young woman was working at a sewing-machine. At\r\nthe moment of the thunderclap, she experienced a violent shock\r\nthroughout her whole body, and a fierce burning sensation in the\r\nhollow of her back. It was found afterwards that between the\r\nshoulder-blades and also on her leg, she had been badly scorched, but\r\nthe wounds quickly healed. Now, in the room of this victim, no trace\r\nwas to be found of the passing of the fireball, neither on the\r\nceiling, nor on the floor, nor on the walls. There was absolutely\r\nnothing to show how the electric fluid could have made its way in from\r\nthe spot in which the fireball had exploded in the neighbouring house,\r\nseparated from it by two thick walls.\r\n\r\nMysterious, is it not? The fireball seems to dwindle out of sight. In\r\nsome cases, it seems to reduce itself into vapour in order to pass\r\nfrom one place to another.\r\n\r\nWith animals these fireballs seem deadlier and more merciless than\r\nwith human beings.\r\n\r\nThus, on February 16, 1866, a thunderstorm descended upon a farm in\r\nthe Commune of Chapelle-Largeau (Deux-Sèvres), and the circumstances\r\nattending its explosion are too remarkable to be overlooked. After a\r\ntremendous thunderclap, a young man who was standing near the farm saw\r\nan immense fireball touch the ground at his feet, but it did him no\r\ndamage, but passed, still harmlessly, through a room in the farmhouse\r\nin which there were nine persons. The only effect it produced was the\r\nflaring up of some matches upon the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\nIt proceeded towards the stables, which were divided into two\r\ncompartments. In one there were two cows and two oxen: the first cow,\r\nto the right of the entrance, was killed, the second was uninjured;\r\nthe first ox was killed, the second was uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe same effect was found to have been produced in the other\r\ncompartment, in which there were four cows; the first and the third\r\nwere killed, the second and fourth were spared: the odd numbers taken\r\nand the even numbers left.\r\n\r\nSimilar freaks have been recorded in connection with piles of plates\r\nstruck by lightning--holes being found in alternate plates. How are\r\nthese things to be explained?\r\n\r\nThe following story is very extraordinary, though it does not help to\r\nclear up the mystery of lightning's strange ways:--\r\n\r\nOn August 24, 1895, about ten in the morning, in the midst of a storm\r\nof wind and rain, several persons saw descending to the ground a\r\nwhitish-coloured globe of about an inch and a half in diameter, which,\r\non touching the ground, split into two smaller globes. These rose at\r\nonce to the height of the chimneys on the houses close by and\r\ndisappeared. One went down a chimney, crossed a room in which were a\r\nman and a child, without harming them, and went through the floor,\r\nperforating a brick with a clean round hole of about the size of a\r\nfranc. Under this room there was a sheepfold. The shepherd's son,\r\nseated at the doorway, suddenly saw a bright light shining over the\r\nflock of sheep, while the lambs were jumping about in alarm. When he\r\nwent up to them, he was startled to discover that five sheep had been\r\nkilled. They bore no trace of burning, or of wound of any kind, but\r\nabout their lips was a sort of foam, slightly pink in colour.\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining house, the second fireball had also gone down a\r\nchimney, and had exploded in the kitchen, causing great damage.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, a young farmer was working on a plot of ground, two or three\r\nmiles from Montfort-l'Amaury. A storm breaking out, he stood up\r\nagainst his horses to take refuge from the rain; moving away a few\r\nyards in order to get his whip, there was seen, when he returned, a\r\nball of fire almost touching the ear of one of his horses. A moment\r\nlater it exploded with a deafening noise. The two horses fell--one of\r\nthem unable to get up again. The farmer himself was dashed to pieces.\r\n\r\nOn other occasions the meteor is hardly more devastating than the\r\nordinary bomb.\r\n\r\nOn April 21, at Lanxade, near Bergerac, a storm had been raging\r\nalready for some hours, when suddenly--simultaneously with a small\r\nthunderclap--a ball of fire, of the size of the opening of a sack of\r\ncorn, fell slowly on one of the banks of the Dordogne, spoiling some\r\nfruit trees, and then crossing the river, it raised a waterspout\r\nseveral yards high as it went.\r\n\r\nIt disappeared finally on the other side of a field of corn.\r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1887, a very curious instance of a fireball was\r\nnoticed on the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIt was at midnight, near Cape Race. An enormous fireball was seen to\r\nrise slowly out of the sea to the height of sixteen or seventeen\r\nmetres. It travelled against the wind, and came quite near the vessel\r\nfrom which it was being watched. Then it turned towards the south-east\r\nand disappeared. The apparition lasted about five minutes.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1902, in the course of a violent storm, and immediately after\r\na loud peal of thunder, a fireball of about the size of a toy balloon\r\nwas seen to make its appearance suddenly in the Rue Veron at\r\nMontmartre. After moving along, just above the ground, in front of a\r\nwine-merchant's shop, it exploded like a bomb, most fortunately\r\nwithout hurting any one, or doing any damage.\r\n\r\nThe little village of Candes, situated by the confluence of the Vienne\r\nand the Loire, was the scene of the appearance of a fireball in June,\r\n1897. Three persons were sitting in the verandah of a house during a\r\nstorm, when they suddenly saw a fireball travelling past them through\r\nthe air for a distance of thirty yards or so. Then it exploded with a\r\nloud noise, striking sparks from the ironworks of the verandah. At the\r\nsame moment, the servants saw another fireball cross a garden at the\r\nother side of the house, and drop into a small pond. A gardener was\r\nknocked over, but not hurt.\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 1894, M. Dandois, professor of surgery at the University\r\nof Louvain, went to the neighbouring town of Linden, by railway, to\r\nsee a patient. On his return, on foot, the sky suddenly so darkened\r\nover, that he made for the nearest dwelling-place, avoiding, as he did\r\nso, the telegraph poles along the road. Suddenly a ball of fire came\r\nagainst him and threw him over a ditch into a field, where he lay\r\nunconscious.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, having regained his senses and finding\r\nhimself undamaged save for a numbness in one arm and one leg, the\r\ndoctor set out again, congratulating himself on the fact that his\r\numbrella had acted as a sort of portable lightning conductor, for the\r\nsteels were all twisted, and showed signs of having borne the brunt of\r\nthe fray. Had the handle been of steel also, the electric current\r\nwould have run down it into his hand, doubtless, and killed him.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a fireball fell upon the door of a house, pushed\r\nit violently open, and made its way into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of this strange visitor, the cook bolted from the room. A\r\nsempstress, who was at work near the window, received a small burn on\r\nher forehead, of about the size of half a franc, with a slight weal a\r\ncouple of inches long--like the tail of a comet.\r\n\r\nAfter bursting, the fireball made its way up the chimney, from which\r\nit removed a mass of soot, smelling somewhat of sulphur.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance more curious still--\r\n\r\nA violent storm was raging near Marseilles, when seven persons, seated\r\ntogether in the ground-floor drawing-room of a country house, saw a\r\nfireball as big as a plate appear in their midst.\r\n\r\nIt directed its course towards a young girl of eighteen, who,\r\nfrightened out of her life, had fallen on her knees. Touching her\r\nshoes, it rebounded to the ceiling, then came down to her feet again,\r\nand so on two or three times, with mysterious regularity, the girl\r\nexperiencing, it seems, no other sensation than that of a slight cramp\r\nin her legs. Eventually the fireball made its exit from the room\r\nthrough a keyhole!\r\n\r\nThe girl could not get up at once after it had gone. For a fortnight\r\nor so she could not walk without assistance, and it was two years\r\nbefore she got over a liability to sudden weakness in her legs,\r\ncausing her suddenly to fall.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to reflect that these diminutive fireballs, produced by\r\nthe actual atmosphere we breathe, are less understood by us than that\r\nenormous globe which we call the sun, and to which is due the\r\nflowering of the entire life of our planet. If we are still in doubt\r\nas to the nature of the sun's spots, at least we have been able to\r\nanalyse its own elements. And we know its dimensions, its weight, its\r\ndistance from us, its rate of rotation, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nYet these electric spheres that make their escape from the clouds in\r\ntimes of storm, baffle our investigations altogether.\r\n\r\nAccording to records which seem authentic, fireballs have been seen\r\nactually to come into existence upon the surface of a ceiling, at the\r\nmouth of a well, and upon the flagstones of a church.\r\n\r\nIn 1713, at the château of Fosdinaro, in the neighbourhood of Massa\r\nCarrara, in the course of a storm and heavy downpour of rain, there\r\nwas seen to appear suddenly upon the ground a very vivid flame, white\r\nand blue in colour. It seemed to flare fiercely, but did not move\r\napparently from the one spot, and after growing quickly in volume it\r\nsuddenly disappeared. Simultaneously with its going, one of the\r\nobservers felt a curious sort of tickling behind his shoulder, moving\r\nupwards; several bits of plaster from the ceiling under which he stood\r\nfell upon his head, and there was a sudden crash quite unlike an\r\nordinary thunderclap.\r\n\r\nIn 1750, on the 2nd of July, at about three in the afternoon, the Abbé\r\nRichard happened to be in the church of St. Michel at Dijon during a\r\nstorm. \"Suddenly,\" he tells us, \"I saw between two pillars of the nave\r\na bright red flame floating in the air about three feet above the\r\nfloor. Presently it rose to a height of twelve or fifteen feet,\r\nincreasing in volume. Then, after having moved some yards to one side,\r\nwhile still rising diagonally to the height almost of the woodwork of\r\nthe organ, it disappeared at last with an explosion like the report of\r\na cannon.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 21, 1745, a violent storm broke out in Boulogne, and the tower\r\nof a convent was struck by a fireball. It was of great size, and was\r\nseen to emerge from one of the sewers of the town and to move along\r\nthe surface of the road until it hit against this tower, of which a\r\npart subsided. No one was hurt. A nun affirmed that some years before\r\nshe had seen just such another fireball emerge from the same spot and\r\nprecipitate itself with a crash against the summit of the tower\r\nwithout doing any damage.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of a violent storm, Dr. Gardons saw several fireballs\r\nflying in different directions, not far from the ground, making a\r\ncrackling sort of noise. One of them was seen by witnesses to come out\r\nof an excavation full of stagnant water. They killed one man, several\r\nanimals, and did much damage to the trees and houses in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1767, at Presbourg, a blue, conical flame escaped\r\nsuddenly with a detonating noise from a brasier, breaking it to\r\npieces, and scattering the glowing cinders all around. It then went\r\ntwisting about the room, burnt the face and hands of a child, escaped\r\npartly through the window, partly through the door, broke into a\r\nthousand pieces a second brasier in another room, and disappeared\r\nfinally up a chimney, carrying up with it and discharging from the\r\nchimney-top into the street several hams which had been hung under the\r\nchimney-piece. For several days afterwards the atmosphere of the house\r\nretained a smell of sulphur.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, fireballs have been seen to come down from the sky\r\napparently, and then, after almost reaching but not actually touching\r\nthe ground, to ascend again. Thus on a hot day in summer 1837, M.\r\nHapoule, a landed proprietor in the department of the Moselle,\r\nstanding in front of the entrance to his stables under the shelter of\r\na porch during a storm, saw a fireball about the size of an orange\r\nmoving in the direction of a dung-heap not far from him. But instead\r\nof going right into it, it stopped about a yard off, and changing its\r\nroute, it went off at an angle, keeping the same level for some\r\ndistance, when it suddenly seemed to change its mind again, and rose\r\nperpendicularly till it disappeared in the clouds.\r\n\r\nThese sudden changes, as we have seen, are strangely characteristic of\r\nthe habits of fireballs.\r\n\r\nThe Garde Champêtre of the village of Lalande de Libourne (Gironde)\r\nwas traversing the country one evening about half-past ten, engaged in\r\norganizing a _garde de surveillance_, when he suddenly found himself\r\nsurrounded by a bright and penetrating light. Astonished, he looked\r\nbehind him, and saw a fireball, just broken loose from a cloud,\r\ndescending quickly to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe light vanished presently, but he made his way towards where the\r\nfireball seemed to be falling. When he had gone about two hundred\r\nyards, he saw another brilliant light breaking out from the top of a\r\ntree and spreading itself into a sheaf of rays, every point of which\r\nseemed to emit electric sparks.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour the light became weaker, and then\r\ndisappeared. The tree was afterwards cut down, and it was found that\r\nthe lightning had gone down the centre to a distance of three yards,\r\nand had then passed down outside to the soil, leaving trace of a\r\nsemi-circular route; and finally, after rising again on the opposite\r\nside of the tree to a height of four yards, tearing off two narrow\r\nstrips of bark, had disappeared. At the foot of the tree a small hole,\r\nabout an inch and a quarter in diameter, retained a certain degree of\r\nwarmth for an hour and a half afterwards.\r\n\r\nFireballs often keep within the frontiers of cloud-land. They may be\r\nseen passing sometimes from one cloud to another in the high regions\r\nof the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOn September 22, 1813, at seven in the evening, M. Louis Ordinaire saw\r\na fireball leave a cloud at the zenith--the sky being very much\r\nlowering at the time--and go towards another. It was of a\r\nreddish-yellow and extremely brilliant, lighting up the ground with a\r\nbright radiance.\r\n\r\nHe was able to follow its movements for at least a minute, and then\r\nsaw it disappear into the second cloud. There was an explosion\r\nfollowed by a dull sound like the firing off of a cannon in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAfter a violent storm which broke out near Wakefield on March 1, 1774,\r\nthere remained only two clouds in the sky, just above the horizon.\r\nBalls of fire were observed gliding from the higher of the two into\r\nthe lower, like falling stars.\r\n\r\nIn high mountainous districts--in the Alps, for instance--you may\r\noften look down from above upon a storm. It is fascinating thus to\r\nwatch the grandiose spectacle of the elements at war. Here from the\r\npen of Père Lozeran du Fesch is a striking picture of such a scene--\r\n\r\n\"It was on the 2nd of September, 1716, about three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. A traveller was making his way down towards Vic from the\r\nsummit of Cantal, accompanied by a guide.\r\n\r\n\"The weather was calm and very warm, but down below, about the middle\r\nof the mountain, a vast sea of mist stretched out in wavelike clouds.\r\n\r\n\"These clouds were furrowed continually by lightning flashes, some\r\ngoing quite straight, some zigzag, some taking the shape of fireballs.\r\nWhen the two men came near this region of clouds, the mist grew so\r\nthick they could hardly see the bridles of their horses.\r\n\r\n\"The air became gradually more cold and the darkness more dense as\r\nthey proceeded downwards. Now they were in the midst of the fireballs\r\nflying in every direction all round them, revolving as they went,\r\nreddish in colour, like saffron lit up.\r\n\r\n\"They were of all sizes--some quite small on their first appearance,\r\nseeming to grow immensely in volume in a few moments. Drops of rain\r\nfell when they passed. Up to this point the sight had been curious but\r\nnot terrifying, but suddenly now, one of these fireballs, about two\r\nfeet in diameter, burst open near the traveller and emitted streams\r\nof a bright and beautiful light in every direction, and there was a\r\ndull report followed by a tremendous crash. The two men were much\r\nshaken and the air all round them seemed polluted. After a minute or\r\ntwo, however, all trace of the explosion had been dissipated, and they\r\nproceeded on their way.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 6, 1850, near Merlan, about six in the afternoon, a\r\nfireball burst above the heads of two men, enveloping them in a bluish\r\nlight, without hurting them or even damaging their clothes, but giving\r\nthem a momentary thrill as from an electric battery. It left no traces\r\nof any kind, not even a smell.\r\n\r\nMr. G. M. Ryan records an instance which he witnessed at Karachi in\r\nScinde. While in his drawing-room one day with two friends who were\r\ntaking refuge from a storm, he rose from his chair and went to the\r\ndoor to open it, the windows as well as the door being shut at the\r\ntime. Returning, he saw in the air and between his friends, a ball of\r\nfire of about the size of a full moon. At the same time there was a\r\nterrible clap of thunder. Two of the spectators were slightly wounded;\r\none felt a sharp pain on the left side of the face, the other, a\r\nsensation in one arm with a feeling as if his hair were burning. There\r\nwas a strong smell of sulphur. In the next room there were two rifles\r\nin a case; one was intact but the other was broken, and there was a\r\nhole in the wall at the point where the muzzle leant against it, and\r\nthere were two holes in the same wall a story higher.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, August 19, 1900, several people were assembled in a room in\r\nthe château of the Baron de France at Maintenay (Pas-de-Calais), when\r\nthere was a violent storm raging over the country.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there appeared in the midst of the eleven people who were\r\nthere, a globe of blue fire about the size of an infant's head, which\r\nquietly crossed the room, touching four people on its way. None of\r\nthem were injured. An awful explosion was heard at the moment when the\r\nelectric ball disappeared through an open door in front of the great\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nOn August 3, 1809, a fireball struck the house of a Mr. David Sutton,\r\nnot far from Newcastle-on-Tyne. Eight people were having tea in the\r\ndrawing-room when a violent clap of thunder knocked down the chimney.\r\n\r\nImmediately after they saw on the ground, at the door opposite the\r\nfireplace, the brilliant visitor which announced itself in the\r\nsonorous voice of Jupiter the thunderer. It remained discreetly at the\r\nentrance of the room, no doubt waiting for the sign to advance. No one\r\nmaking a move, it came into the middle of the room, and there burst\r\nwith a crash, throwing out fiery grains like aeroliths.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle must have been magnificent--but, we must acknowledge,\r\nrather disquieting.\r\n\r\nOn September 27, 1772, at Besançon, a voluminous fireball crossed over\r\na corn-shop and the ward of a hospital full of nurses and children.\r\nThis time again the lightning was merciful--it spared nurses and\r\nchildren, and went and drowned itself in the Doubs.\r\n\r\nNearly thirty years before, in July, 1744, it showed the same regard\r\nfor an honest German peasant woman. She was occupied in the kitchen\r\nsuperintending the family meal, when, after a terrible clap of\r\nthunder, she saw a fireball the size of a fist come down the chimney,\r\npass between her feet without hurting her, and continue on its course\r\nwithout burning or even upsetting the spinning-wheel and other objects\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\nMuch frightened, the young woman tried to escape; she threw herself\r\ntowards the door and opened it, when the fireball at once followed\r\nher, played about her feet, went into the next room, which opened\r\nout-of-doors, crossed it, and through the door into the yard.\r\n\r\nIt went round the yard, entered a barn by an open door, climbed the\r\nwall opposite, and reaching the edge of the roof, burst with such a\r\nterrific noise that the peasant woman fainted. The barn at once took\r\nfire and was reduced to cinders.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the last century, March 3, 1835, the steeple of\r\nCrailsheim was set on fire by lightning. The guardian's daughter, aged\r\ntwenty years, was at this moment in her room and had her back turned\r\nto the window, when her young brother saw a fireball enter by the\r\nwindow-sill and descend on to his sister's back, giving her a sudden\r\nshock all over her body. The young girl then saw at her feet a\r\nquantity of small flames, which went towards the kitchen, the door of\r\nwhich had been opened, and set fire to a pile of mossy wood. There was\r\nno further damage than this attempt at incendiarism, which was easily\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a fireball seems to take a malignant pleasure in hurling\r\nitself like a fury against lightning conductors; but instead of\r\nquietly impaling itself like the linear lightning, and breathing its\r\nlast sigh in a prolonged roar, it struggles, and comes forth\r\nvictorious from this curious contest.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases of fireballs playing about the lightning\r\nconductors without being caught.\r\n\r\nIn 1777, a fireball shot from the clouds on to the point of the\r\nlightning conductor on the Observatory of Padua. The conductor, which\r\nconsisted of an iron chain, was broken at its junction with the stem.\r\nHowever, it sent on the discharge.\r\n\r\nSome years later, in 1792, a huge ball of lightning struck one of the\r\ntwo conductors on the house of M. Haller at Villiers la Garenne. This\r\nconductor was much injured by the audacious assailant, and so was the\r\nframework of the house; the keen fluid had damaged the metallic\r\ngutters.\r\n\r\nAt this point I must add that lightning conductors are of recent\r\ncreation. Nor would it be surprising if there were defective ones\r\nwhich could not assure an efficient protection.\r\n\r\nHowever, much later, on December 20, 1845, the same phenomenon was\r\nobserved at the château of Bortyvon, near Vire. There, again, the\r\nfireball, ignoring the danger to which it was exposing itself, flung\r\nitself on a lightning conductor placed in the centre of the château.\r\nIt was spared, but the château suffered greatly. The electric ball\r\ndescended from both sides of the metallic stem, causing a great deal\r\nof damage along its path. On touching the ground it expanded, and many\r\npersons affirm that they saw what was like a huge cask of fire rolling\r\nalong the ground.\r\n\r\nIn truth, ball lightning seems in a certain measure to escape the\r\ninfluence of lightning conductors.\r\n\r\nOn September 4, 1903, towards ten o'clock in the evening, M. Laurence\r\nRotch, director of the Observatory of Blue Hill (U.S.), happening to\r\nbe in Paris, made the following curious observation from the\r\nRond-point of the Champs Elysées.\r\n\r\nLooking in the direction of the Eiffel Tower, he saw the summit of the\r\nedifice struck by white lightning coming from the zenith. At the same\r\nmoment a fireball, less dazzling than the lightning, slowly descended\r\nfrom the summit to the second platform. It appeared to be about one\r\nyard in diameter, and to be situated in the middle of the tower,\r\ntaking less than two seconds to cover a distance of about 100 yards.\r\nThen it disappeared. The next day the observer ascertained, on\r\nvisiting the tower, that it had actually been struck by lightning\r\ntwice on the previous day.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the meteor did not follow the conductor; but,\r\nafter all, is not the whole tower itself the most powerful conductor\r\nimaginable? Would not the enormous masses of iron used in its\r\nconstruction neutralize the attraction of the thin metallic rods,\r\neffectual for the protection of ordinary buildings, but incapable, one\r\nwould think, of competing with the attractive force of this immense\r\nmetallic framework?\r\n\r\nHere are some cases where globular lightning has struck bells or\r\ntelegraph wires, which it has followed with docility.\r\n\r\nSeveral times it has been seen poised like a bird on a telegraph wire\r\nnear a railway-station, and has then quietly disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EIFFEL TOWER AS A COLOSSAL LIGHTNING CONDUCTOR.\r\n\r\nPhotograph taken June 3, 1902, at 9.20 p.m., by M. G. Loppé. Published\r\nin the _Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France_ (May, 1905)]\r\n\r\nWe see that it is not absolutely inimical to points, nor to metals,\r\nbut it prefers its independence, and he must get up early who would\r\ncatch it in a snare.\r\n\r\nIt is an anarchist--it acknowledges no rule.\r\n\r\nBut we must confess that if spheroidal lightning seems particularly\r\ncapricious, it is because we are still ignorant of the laws which\r\nguide it. Our ignorance alone is the cause of the mystery.\r\n\r\nWe try to discover the enigma in the silence of the laboratories,\r\nwhere physicians question science without ceasing; we try to reproduce\r\nfireballs artificially, but the problem is complicated, and its\r\nsolution presents enormous difficulties.\r\n\r\nHypotheses are not wanting. Some years ago, M. Stéphane Leduc recorded\r\nan interesting experiment, producing a moving globular spark.\r\n\r\nWhen two very fine and highly polished metallic points, each in\r\naffinity with one of the poles of an electro-static machine, rest\r\nperpendicularly on the sensitive face of a gelatine bromide of silver\r\nphotographic plate, which is placed on a metallic leaf, the two points\r\nbeing 5 to 10 centimetres the one from the other, an effluvium is\r\nproduced round the positive point, while at the negative point a\r\nluminous globule is formed.\r\n\r\nWhen this globule has reached a sufficient size, you can see it detach\r\nitself from the point, which ceases to be luminous, begin to move\r\nforward slowly on the plate, make a few curves, and then set off for\r\nthe positive point; when it reaches this, the effluvium is\r\nextinguished, all luminous phenomenon ceases, and the machine acts as\r\nif its two poles were united by a conductor.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which the luminous globe moves is very slight. It takes\r\nfrom one to four minutes to cover a distance of 5 to 6 centimetres.\r\nSometimes, before reaching the positive point, the globe bursts into\r\ntwo or more luminous globules, which individually continue their\r\njourney towards the positive point.\r\n\r\nOn developing the plate, you will find traced on it the route followed\r\nby the globule, the point of explosion, the routes resulting from the\r\ndivision, the effluvium round the positive point. Also, if you stop\r\nthe experiment before the arrival of the globule at the positive\r\npoint, the photograph will only give the route to that point.\r\n\r\nThe globule makes its course the conductor. If during its journey you\r\nwere to throw powder on the plate--sulphur, for example--the course it\r\nfollowed will be marked by a line of little aigrettes, looking like a\r\nluminous rosary.\r\n\r\nOf all the known electric phenomena, this is the most analogous with\r\nglobular lightning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF THE POSITIVE POLE OF AN ELECTRIC SPARK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF THE NEGATIVE POLE OF AN ELECTRIC SPARK.]\r\n\r\nBut the really complicated part of the question is when ball\r\nlightning loses part of its fluidity and becomes a semi-solid body, as\r\nin the following instance:--\r\n\r\nOn April 24, 1887, a storm burst over Mortrée (Orne), and the\r\nlightning literally chopped the telegraph wire on the route to\r\nArgentan for a distance of 150 yards. The pieces were so calcinated\r\nthat they might have been under the fire of a forge; some of the\r\nlonger ones were bent and their sections welded together. The\r\nlightning entered by the door of a stable in the form of a fireball,\r\nand came near a person who was preparing to milk a cow; then it\r\n_passed between the legs of the animal_, and disappeared without\r\ncausing any damage. The terrified cow raised itself on its hind legs\r\nwith frantic bellowing, and its master ran away, frightened out of his\r\nwits, but there was no harm done.\r\n\r\nThe inexplicable phenomenon was that at the precise moment when the\r\nlightning crossed the stable, a great quantity of incandescent stones\r\nfell before a neighbouring house. \"Some of these fragments, of the\r\nsize of nuts,\" wrote the Minister of Post and Telegraphs at the\r\nAcademy, \"are of a not very thick material, of a greyish-white, and\r\neasily broken by the fingers, giving forth a characteristic odour of\r\nsulphur. The others, which are smaller, are exactly like coke.\r\n\r\n\"It would perhaps be useful to say here, that during this storm the\r\nthunderclaps were not preceded by the ordinary muttering, they burst\r\nquickly like the discharge of musketry, and succeeded one another at\r\nshort intervals. Hail fell in abundance, and the temperature was very\r\nlow.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only by a semblance of disbelief that one can get the peasants\r\nto tell us the stories of what they pretend to have seen of the fall\r\nof aeroliths during storms. They have christened the uranoliths\r\n\"thunder-stones.\"\r\n\r\nThese substances have evidently no relation to uranoliths, but they\r\nprove none the less that ponderable matter may accompany the fall of\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nHere are two more examples--\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1885, a storm burst over Sotteville\r\n(Seine-Inférieure); lightning furrowed the sky, the thunder muttered,\r\nand the rain fell in torrents. Suddenly, in the Rue Pierre Corneille,\r\nseveral small balls, about the size of a common pea, were seen to\r\nfall; these burned on touching the ground, sending out a little violet\r\nflame. People counted more than twenty, and one of the spectators, on\r\nputting her foot on one of them, produced a fresh flame. They left no\r\ntrace on the ground.\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 1880, in Paris, during a rather violent storm, in broad\r\ndaylight, M. A. Trécul, of the Institute, saw a very brilliant\r\nvoluminous body, yellowish-white, and rather long in shape, being\r\napparently 35 to 40 centimetres in length, by about 25 in width, with\r\nslightly conical ends.\r\n\r\nThis body was only visible for a few seconds; it seemed to disappear\r\nand re-enter a cloud, but in departing--and this is the chief\r\npoint--it dropped a little substance, which fell vertically like a\r\nheavy body under the sole influence of gravity. It left a trail of\r\nlight behind it, at the edges of which could be seen sparks, or rather\r\nred globules, because their light did not flash. Near the falling\r\nsubstance the luminous trail was almost vertical, while in the further\r\npart it was sinuous. The small substance divided in falling, and the\r\nlight went out soon after, when it was on the point of reaching the\r\ntops of the houses. When it was disappearing, and at the moment of the\r\ndivision, no noise was heard, although the cloud was not far away.\r\n\r\nThis fact incontestably proves the presence of ponderable matter in\r\nclouds, which is not violently projected by an explosion in the bolis,\r\nnor accompanied by a noisy electric discharge.\r\n\r\nWe are still far from understanding the interesting problem of the\r\nformation and nature of ball lightning. Instead of denying it, men of\r\nscience ought to study it, because it is certainly one of the most\r\nremarkable of the curiosities of atmospheric electricity.\r\n\r\nWe must begin by finding out the exact facts, which are extraordinary\r\nenough to captivate our attention. The theories will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF LIGHTNING ON MANKIND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe destructive work of lightning in every form is immense. A\r\nformidable and invisible world skirts the earth--an enchanted world,\r\nmore wonderful than any Eastern legend--an unknown ocean, whose\r\nimmaterial presence is constantly brought before us by the most\r\nfearful electric conflagrations.\r\n\r\nEven to-day the brilliancy of lightning hides itself from us in the\r\ndarkness of impenetrable mystery. But we feel that there is an\r\nimmeasurable power, an unimaginable force which rules us.\r\n\r\nWe are, in fact, but puny beings in comparison with this magic force,\r\nand the ancients were wise when they made the King of the Gods\r\nresponsible for the actions of lightning. He alone in His splendour\r\nand sovereignty could exercise such an empire over our modest\r\nplanet--above all, over man's imagination.\r\n\r\nScience slowly follows the centuries in their ascending march towards\r\nprogress. At present our knowledge of ball lightning is limited, and\r\nwe have only the principal facts of nature to contribute to the\r\nelucidation of the problem.\r\n\r\nIn increasing our observations, and in comparing those which are\r\nanalogous, we may hope, if not to arrive at an immediate conclusion,\r\nat least to help in the work of discovering what laws govern this\r\nsubtle and imponderable fluid.\r\n\r\nHere it will strike a man dead without leaving a trace; there it will\r\nonly attack the clothes and insinuate itself as far as the skin\r\nwithout even grazing it. It will burn the lining of a garment, and\r\nleave the material of which it is made intact. Sometimes it profits by\r\nthe bewilderment caused by its dazzling light to entirely undress a\r\nperson, and leave him naked and inanimate, but with no external wound,\r\nnot even a scratch.\r\n\r\nWe find as many peculiarities as facts.\r\n\r\nSome of the actions of lightning remind one of the fantastic stories\r\nof Hoffmann and Edgar Poe, but nature is more wonderful than the\r\nimagination of man, and lightning remains supreme in its\r\nphantasmagoria.\r\n\r\nThunder seems to play with the ignorance of man; its crimes and jests\r\nwould have been ascribed to the devil in olden days. We submit to the\r\neffects without being able to determine the cause which directs them.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if lightning were a subtle being--a medium between\r\nthe unconscious force which lives in plants and the conscious force\r\nin animals. It is like an elemental spirit, keen, capricious,\r\nmalicious or stupid, far-seeing or blind, wilful or indifferent,\r\npassing from one extreme to another, and of a unique and terrifying\r\ncharacter. We see it twisting into space, moving with astonishing\r\ndexterity among men, appearing and disappearing with the rapidity ...\r\nof lightning ... it is impossible to define its nature.\r\n\r\nAt all events, it is a great mistake to trifle with it. It means\r\nrunning great risks. It resents being interfered with, and those who\r\ntry to probe into its domain are generally rather cruelly put in their\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt was an indiscretion of this kind which cost Dr. Richmann his life.\r\n\r\nHe had fixed an insulated iron rod from the roof of his house to his\r\nlaboratory; this conducted the atmospheric electricity to him, and he\r\nmeasured its intensity every day. On August 6, 1753, in the middle of\r\na violent storm, he was keeping at a distance from the rod in order to\r\navoid the powerful sparks, and was waiting for the time to measure it,\r\nwhen, his engraver entering suddenly, he took a few steps towards him\r\nwhich brought him too near the conductor. A globe of blue fire, the\r\nsize of a fist, struck him on the head and stretched him stone dead.\r\n\r\nThis beginning to the study of physics was hardly encouraging.\r\n\r\nThe visitations of lightning are so numerous that it would naturally\r\nbe impossible to describe them all in this small collection. We must,\r\ntherefore, choose among them, but here we encounter a great\r\ndifficulty. Among the thousands of _tours de force_ and of dexterity\r\naccomplished by lightning, which should we take and which leave? The\r\nselection is very difficult, as it means leaving out a large number of\r\ncurious examples with a good many very interesting observations.\r\n\r\nWe will choose the most important--those of which the authenticity\r\nappears incontestable, and which contain the most precise details. We\r\nwill group together those among them which present points of\r\nresemblance. This approximate classification will give us a\r\nsufficiently complete picture for the harmony of this study.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most astonishing actions of lightning is certainly that of\r\nleaving the victim in the very attitude in which he was surprised by\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nCardan gives an extraordinary example of this kind.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a violent storm, eight reapers, who were taking their\r\nmeal under an oak, were struck, all eight of them, by the same flash\r\nof lightning, the noise of which could be heard a long way off. When\r\nthe passers-by approached to see what had happened, the reapers thus\r\nsuddenly petrified by death, appeared to be continuing their peaceful\r\nmeal. One held his glass, another was carrying the bread to his mouth,\r\na third had his hand on the dish. Death had seized them all in the\r\nposition which they occupied when the explosion occurred.\r\n\r\nWe hear of many similar cases to this.\r\n\r\nHere is one of a young woman who no doubt was struck by lightning in\r\nthe position in which she was found after the accident. It was during\r\na violent storm on July 16, 1866; she was alone in the house at\r\nSaint-Romain-les-Atheux (Loire), and outside the thunder rolled\r\nfearfully. When her parents came back from the fields, they found a\r\nsad sight. The young woman had been killed by lightning. They found\r\nher kneeling in a corner of the room with her head buried in her\r\nhands; she had no trace of a wound. Her child of four months, who was\r\nin bed in the same room, was only lightly touched.\r\n\r\nQuite recently, on May 24, 1904, at Charolles (Saône-et-Loire), a\r\ncertain Mlle. Moreau, who lived at Lesmes, was waiting for the end of\r\na storm in a grocer's shop where she had been making some purchases.\r\nSeveral people were gathered round the fireplace. They felt a great\r\nmovement following a violent clap of thunder. The sensation having\r\npassed, every one prepared to go. Mlle. Moreau alone remained seated,\r\nand did not move. She had been struck by the fluid, which had made a\r\nhole under her right ear and come out by the left!\r\n\r\nThe petrifying action of the electric fluid is so rapid that horsemen\r\nwho have been struck have remained on horseback and been carried a\r\nlong way from the place of the accident without being unsaddled.\r\n\r\nAccording to Abbé Richard, towards the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nthe procurator of the Seminary of Troyes was coming home on horseback\r\nwhen he was struck by lightning. A brother who followed him, not\r\nperceiving this, thought that he was asleep when he saw him reeling.\r\nWhen he tried to awaken him, he found he was dead.\r\n\r\nThe following observation is very remarkable on account of the special\r\nattitudes preserved by the bodies which had been struck:--\r\n\r\nA vessel which was at Port Mahon was struck at the time when the crew\r\nwere dispersed over the yards to furl the sails. Fifteen sailors who\r\nwere scattered on the bowsprit were killed or burned in the twinkling\r\nof an eye. Some were thrown into the water; others, bent dead across\r\nthe yard-arm, remained in the position they had occupied before the\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nOften the corpses of people who have been struck have been found\r\neither sitting or standing.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of a storm a vine-dresser was seated under a nut tree\r\nwhich was planted near a hedge: soon afterwards, when it had ceased\r\nraining and the thunder was quiet, his two sisters, who had been\r\ntaking shelter under the hedge, saw him sitting, and called to him to\r\ngo back to work, but he did not reply; on going up to him, they found\r\nhim dead.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, in the neighbourhood of Asti, a priest who was struck while\r\ndining remained in his place.\r\n\r\nIn 1698, a ship was struck at about four o'clock in the morning, not\r\nfar from Saint-Pierre. At daybreak a sailor was found sitting stone\r\ndead at the bow of the ship, with his eyes open and the whole body in\r\nsuch a natural attitude that he seemed to be alive. He had suffered no\r\ninjury either external or internal.\r\n\r\nDr. Boudin describes a still more surprising case. A woman was struck\r\nwhile she was in the act of plucking a poppy. The body was found\r\nstanding, only slightly bent and with the flower still in her hand. It\r\nis hard to understand how a human body could remain standing, slightly\r\nbent, without a support to prevent its falling. This case is a\r\ncontradiction to all the laws of equilibrium. But with such a\r\nfantastic agent as that with which we are dealing, nothing is\r\nsurprising--we may expect anything. Thus--\r\n\r\nOn August 2, 1862, lightning struck the entrance pavilion of the\r\nPrince Eugene barracks in Paris just when the soldiers were going to\r\nbed. All those who were lying down suddenly found themselves\r\nstanding, and those who were standing were thrown on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding examples the victims struck dead are not disfigured\r\nby the fulgurant force. They preserve a deceptive appearance of life.\r\nThe catastrophe is so sudden that the face has no time to assume a sad\r\nexpression. No contraction of the muscles reveals a transition in the\r\npassage of life and death. The eyes and mouth are open as though in a\r\nstate of watching. When the colour of the flesh is preserved, the\r\nillusion is complete. But when we approach these statues of flesh--so\r\nlately animated with vital fire, now mummified by celestial fire--we\r\nare surprised on touching them to find that they crumble to ashes.\r\n\r\nThe garments are intact, the body presents no difference, it keeps the\r\nattitude it had at the supreme moment, but it is entirely burnt,\r\nconsumed. Thus--\r\n\r\nAt Vic-sur-Aisne (Aisne) in 1838, in the middle of a violent storm,\r\nthree soldiers took shelter under a lime tree. Lightning struck them\r\nall dead at one blow. All the same, they all three remained standing\r\nin their original positions as though they had not been touched by the\r\nelectric fluid: their clothes were intact! After the storm some\r\npassers-by noticed them, spoke to them without receiving an answer,\r\nand went up to touch them, when they fell pulverized into a heap of\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nThis experience is not unique, and even the ancients remarked that\r\npeople who were struck crumbled to dust.\r\n\r\nHere is a similar case, no less curious--\r\n\r\nOn June 13, 1893, at Rodez, a shepherd named Desmazes, seeing that a\r\nstorm was threatening, collected his beasts and drove them quickly\r\ntowards the farm. When he was just there, he was struck by lightning.\r\nHis body, which was completely incinerated, preserved a natural\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nIt is by this complete incineration and the probable volatilization of\r\nthe cinders that certain authors explain the sudden disappearance of\r\nsome of those who have been struck.\r\n\r\nLegend attributes the mysterious death of Romulus to a similar cause.\r\nAccording to Livy, the illustrious founder of Rome was reviewing his\r\narmy in a plain near the marsh of Capra. Suddenly a storm accompanied\r\nby violent claps of thunder enveloped the king in a cloud so thick\r\nthat it hid him from sight. From that moment Romulus was seen no more\r\non earth.\r\n\r\nIt is true, Livy adds, that some of the witnesses suspected the\r\nsenators of having torn him to pieces: kings have sometimes been\r\nsubject to all kinds of surprises on the part of their \"courtiers.\"\r\n\r\nIn most cases the electric matter produces burns more or less severe.\r\nThese, when they do not attack the whole organism as in the preceding\r\nexamples, are localized to certain parts of the body. Sometimes they\r\nare quite superficial and only attack the epidermis. Often without\r\nabsolute carbonization, they penetrate deep into the flesh and cause\r\ndeath after the most fearful suffering.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of different sorts of burns--\r\n\r\nIn 1865, in the Rue Pigalle in Paris, a man had his eyes burnt by\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nA young soldier of the 27th Battalion of Chasseurs was armed, mounting\r\nguard at the Col de Soda. It was in the month of July, 1900. Suddenly\r\nhe was surrounded by the dazzling glare of lightning, which was almost\r\nimmediately succeeded by an awful explosion of thunder. The sentinel,\r\nleaving his arms, fell backwards screaming. People ran to him, and saw\r\nthat the fluid, attracted by the point of the bayonet, had struck it,\r\nand, gliding down, the metal had burnt his feet rather severely.\r\n\r\nAt Malines, in Belgium, a mill was reduced to splinters by the fire of\r\nheaven. The miller and two of his customers were there at the time of\r\nthe accident. Not one of the three men was killed, but the miller was\r\nseriously burnt in the head, on the chin and the cheeks. He was deaf\r\nand blind for twenty-four hours. One of the others was burned in the\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nOn June 19, 1903, at about six in the evening, during a bad storm,\r\nfive farmers were crossing the Champ de Gentillerie near Saint-Servan,\r\nin order to take shelter. Three of them were walking abreast, the two\r\nothers, of whom one was leading an ass, were some paces behind, when\r\nsuddenly the five men and the ass were thrown on the ground by a\r\nviolent clap of thunder. Three of the farmers, recovering their\r\nconsciousness after the shock, observed that their two companions were\r\nstruck; the head of one was carbonized, and the left side of the other\r\nwas burnt as though by a red-hot iron.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon, no less appalling--\r\n\r\nA woman who was struck had her leg so horribly burnt that, on removing\r\nthe stocking, some particles of flesh adhered to it. From the knee to\r\nthe end of the foot the skin was black as though carbonized, and the\r\nwhole surface was covered with a species of blister full of a\r\nsero-purulent liquid. The burns were very serious but not mortal, and\r\nwere localized in the leg.\r\n\r\nLightning also sometimes produces wounds which are more or less\r\nsevere. It perforates the bones. The injuries it causes are similar to\r\nthose inflicted by firearms.\r\n\r\nIt can also cause partial or total paralysis, the loss of speech or\r\nsight, temporary or permanent. Its action is manifold on the human\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nA more extraordinary phenomenon still is that people who are struck\r\nshow no sign of the slightest injury on a minute medical examination.\r\nThe ancients remarked this, as we see in the charming passage from\r\nPlutarch: \"Lightning struck them dead without leaving any mark on the\r\nbodies nor any wound or burn--their souls fled from their bodies in\r\nfright, like a bird which escapes from its cage.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the smell of fulminated air and of ozone. In\r\nsome cases there is more than that.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 1895, lightning struck a low house at Moulins in the\r\ncourse of a violent storm. The fluid, eccentric as usual, attacked the\r\nouter chimney, the bricks of which were loose and projected slightly.\r\nIt broke some tiles on the roof, the length of one rafter, and inside\r\nthe corn-loft it broke the wooden handle of an iron rake to splinters.\r\nOn the ground floor, bricks were both loosened and torn out near where\r\nthe pipe of the stove went into the wall of the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\nA dozen plates were broken in a cupboard to the left of the hearth,\r\nand a woman who happened to be near it at the time of the explosion,\r\nsaid she had felt her legs warmed by the burning air which came from\r\nthe cupboard. The room was afterwards filled with a thick infected\r\nsmoke, a veritable poison.\r\n\r\nSometimes the victims are nearly asphyxiated by the fulminic\r\neffluvium, and only owe their preservation to the extreme care which\r\nis lavished on them.\r\n\r\nVery often the bodies and the clothes of people who have been struck\r\ngive forth a nauseous smell--generally similar to that of burning\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1879, a woman who had been struck at\r\nMontoulieu, in the Champ Descubert quarter, had her skull perforated\r\nas though a big ball had passed through it, and her burnt clothes gave\r\nforth insupportable emanations.\r\n\r\nDr. Minonzio relates how three persons were wounded by lightning on\r\nboard the Austrian frigate _The Medée_. \"I remember,\" he says, \"the\r\nsensation which was caused in the locality by the stench which came\r\nfrom the bodies and clothes of these people who were struck--a stench\r\nnearly as offensive as that of burnt sulphur mingled with\r\nempyreumatical oil.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent and good-natured effects of lightning on man\r\nis to shave his hair and beard, to scorch them, or even to depilate\r\nthe whole body.\r\n\r\nGenerally the victim may consider himself lucky if he leaves a handful\r\nof hair as a ransom to the lightning, and escapes with a fright.\r\n\r\nThere is even a case given of a young girl of twenty who had her hair\r\ncut as though by a razor, without perceiving it or feeling the least\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nOn May 7, 1885, two men who were in a windmill were struck by\r\nlightning. They were both struck deaf, and the hair and beard and\r\neyebrows of one were burnt. In addition to this, their clothes\r\ncrumbled to the touch.\r\n\r\nA man, who must have been very hairy, was struck by lightning near\r\nAix. The electric current raised the hairs of his body in ridges from\r\nthe breast to the feet, rolled them into pellets, and incrusted them\r\ndeeply in the calf of the leg.\r\n\r\nVery often the injury to the hair, instead of being spread all over\r\nthe body, limits itself to certain places where it is thicker or\r\ndamper on the body of a man, and more especially on that of a woman.\r\nHere are some curious examples.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Sestier's learned work, vol. ii. p. 45, we read the following\r\ncase observed at Montpellier:--\r\n\r\n\"Accidit apud Monspelienses ut fulmen cadens in domum vicarii\r\ngeneralis de Grassi pudendum puellae ancillae pilos abraserit ut\r\nBartassius in muliere sibi familiari olim factum fuisse.\"\r\n\r\nToaldo Richard has described similar experiences, and d'Hombres Firmas\r\nhas described several others:--\r\n\r\nA number of people were assembled at Mas-Lacoste, near Nîmes, when\r\nlightning penetrated to where they were. A girl of twenty-six was\r\nthrown over and became unconscious; when she came to her senses, she\r\ncould hardly support herself or walk, and felt a great deal of pain\r\nin the centre of her body. When she was alone with her friends, they\r\nexamined her, and they saw \"non sine miratione pudendum perustum\r\nruberrimum, labia tumefacta pilos deficientes usque ad bulbum\r\npunctosque nigros pro pilis, inde cutim rugosissimam; ejus referunt\r\namicae primum barbatissimam et hoc facto semper imberbem esse.\"\r\n\r\nLightning is indeed a joker, but so it has always been.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the hair grows again, but sometimes the system is\r\ncompletely destroyed, and the victim must either wear a wig or go\r\nbald.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken further back of the case of Dr. Gaultier, of\r\nClaubry, who was struck one day by globular lightning, near Blois, and\r\nhad his beard shaved off and destroyed for ever; it never grew again.\r\nHe nearly died of a curious malady, his head swelled to the size of a\r\nmetre and a half in circumference.\r\n\r\nWe also hear of corpses of people who have been struck, which show no\r\nother injury than a complete or partial epilation.\r\n\r\nFor example, a woman who was struck in the road had the hair\r\ncompletely pulled out of the top of her head.\r\n\r\nOn July 25, 1900, a farm servant, Pierre Roux, was killed while in the\r\nact of loading a waggon of hay. The only trace the lightning left\r\nbehind it was to completely scorch the beard of its victim.\r\n\r\nNow, here is a case the complete opposite of the preceding ones and\r\nstill more curious, in which the capricious and fantastic lightning\r\nattacked the epidermis without burning the hair which covered it.\r\n\r\nAt Dampierre thunder broke over a house belonging to M. Saumois. His\r\narm, one leg, and the left side of his body were burnt, and the\r\nextraordinary thing is that the skin of the arm was burnt leaving the\r\nhair intact.\r\n\r\nA little further on we shall have cases where the lightning has proved\r\nsalutary in certain forms of illness.\r\n\r\nGenerally the people who are struck fall at once without a struggle.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved by a great number of observations that the man who\r\nhas been struck by lightning so as to lose consciousness immediately\r\nfalls without having seen, heard, or felt anything. This is easy to\r\nbelieve, since electricity is animated by a movement much quicker than\r\nthat of light, and still more so than that of sound. The eye and ear\r\nare paralyzed before the lightning and the thunder could have made an\r\nimpression on them; so much so that the victims, when they recover\r\nthemselves, are unable to explain what has happened to them.\r\n\r\nPeople struck by lightning nearly always sink on the very spot where\r\nthey have been struck. Besides this, we have already remarked several\r\ncases where the people struck have preserved the exact positions they\r\nhad at the moment of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, we can quote some examples, rarer, but\r\ndiametrically opposed to these.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 1839, lightning struck an oak near Triel (Seine-et-Oise),\r\nand also struck two quarrymen, father and son. This last was killed\r\ndead, raised, and transported twenty-three yards away.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon Brillouet was surprised by a storm near Chantilly, and was\r\nraised by the lightning and deposited twenty-five paces from where he\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nOn August 18, 1884, at Namur (Belgium), a man was flung ten yards from\r\nthe tree under which he had been struck by lightning.\r\n\r\nThe following notice was in the papers in August, 1900:--\r\n\r\n\"Brousses-et-Villaret (Aude), August 20. During the storm which burst\r\nover that region the lightning killed two cows belonging to M.\r\nBouchère. It also struck, but without hurting him, a young man of\r\ntwenty-three years of age, Bernard Robart, artilleryman, who was\r\ntaking a holiday. He was walking to a neighbouring farm when he was\r\nsuddenly carried through the air for fifty yards. He got up again\r\nwithout any hurt, only he was dazzled by the lightning which had\r\nflashed before his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nOn writing to the victim to verify this fact, I received the following\r\nanswer:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have the honour to inform you that the article relating to\r\n     the incident which happened to me during the lightning, on\r\n     the 17th, is absolutely true.\r\n\r\n     \"I was on leave at Brousses, Canton of Saissac (Aude). I left\r\n     my uncle's house at about 8 p.m. There had been a heavy\r\n     storm. The rain had nearly stopped for about two or three\r\n     minutes, but it still fell a little. There had been a good\r\n     deal of thunder during the storm. I was sleeping at home, the\r\n     house being about two hundred yards away. It was very dark,\r\n     and seeing that the rain was going to begin again with\r\n     violence, I started to run. I went very quick. I was crossing\r\n     the Place, and when I arrived in front of M. Combes' house, I\r\n     suddenly felt myself stopped, and without being able to\r\n     explain how, I found myself in the same instant at the other\r\n     side of the Place, lying on the ground against the wall of M.\r\n     Maistre's house. I was astounded; I waited a good minute\r\n     without knowing where I was. When I got home I felt a severe\r\n     pain in the right knee, and I perceived that my trousers were\r\n     torn and that I had a big scar on my knee, and that my hands\r\n     were slightly scorched. It must have happened against the\r\n     wall where there were some loose stones. I was transported\r\n     about fifty yards, and I cannot tell you if it thundered at\r\n     the same time, but there had been a big clap about a minute\r\n     before. Two people who were leaving M. Combes' house were\r\n     witness of the fact. The lightning penetrated into M.\r\n     Bouchère's stables two hundred yards away, and killed two\r\n     cows and broke the leg of another. As it went in it broke the\r\n     cover of the doorway, which was of freestone, in two, and\r\n     knocked over a chair and seven or eight bottles which were on\r\n     a shelf.\r\n\r\n         \"Believe me, etc.,\r\n\r\n                \"BERNARD ROBERT,\r\n                \"Artilleryman, Fort Saint Nicholas,\r\n                \"Marseilles.\"\r\n\r\nThus we have several examples of people being transported 20, 30, and\r\n50 yards from the point where the lightning has struck them.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bodies of people who are struck are as stiff as iron and\r\nretain their stiffness.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1854, a waggoner, thirty-five years of age, was struck in\r\nParis. The next day Dr. Sestier saw his corpse at the Morgue: it was\r\nperfectly stiff. The next day, forty-four hours after the death, this\r\nstiffness was still most marked.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, in the Commune of Hectomare (Eure), lightning struck\r\na man named Delabarre, who was holding a piece of bread in his hand.\r\nThe contractility of the nerves was so strong that it could not be\r\ntaken from him.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the bodies very often remain flexible after death,\r\nas in life.\r\n\r\nOn September 17, 1780, a violent storm burst over Eastbourne. A\r\ncoachman and footman were killed. \"Although the bodies remained from\r\nSunday to Tuesday unburied,\" remarked an observer, \"all their limbs\r\nwere as flexible as those of living people.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes the corpses soften and decompose rapidly, leaving an\r\nunbearable odour.\r\n\r\nOn June 15, 1794, lightning killed a lady in a ballroom at Fribourg.\r\nThe corpse rapidly gave forth a curious odour of putrefaction. The\r\ndoctor could hardly examine it without fainting. The inhabitants of\r\nthe house were obliged to go away thirty-six hours after the death,\r\nthe odour was so penetrating. It was with difficulty that they were\r\nable to put the fetid corpse into a coffin. It fell to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe flabbiness often observed in the bodies of people who are struck\r\nis due, no doubt, to the fact that in the case of enormous discharge,\r\nthe stiffness of a dead body develops so quickly, and is of such a\r\nshort duration, that it may escape observation.\r\n\r\nNumbers of experiments made on animals justify this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the majority of cases, bodies which have been struck\r\ndecompose rapidly, which explains quite naturally the softness of\r\nbodies killed by lightning.\r\n\r\nThe colouration of these presents numerous varieties; sometimes the\r\nface is of a corpse-like paleness, at others it preserves its natural\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, the face is livid, red, violet, violet-bronze, black,\r\nyellow, and even covered over with brown or blue spots.\r\n\r\nThe colouration of the face may be extended over all or nearly all the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe eight reapers who were killed under an oak, quoted by Cardan in\r\nour first example, were quite black.\r\n\r\nThat the subtle fluid accumulated in great masses in the clouds should\r\nkill a man, deprive him of movement, annihilate his faculties, or\r\nslightly wound him--this ought not to astonish us when we contemplate\r\nthe marvellous results and the prodigies of strength accomplished by\r\nthe much more feeble electricity of our laboratories.\r\n\r\nBut the extraordinary point about lightning is its variety of action.\r\nWhy does it not invariably kill those it strikes? and why does it\r\nsometimes not even wound them?\r\n\r\nThere are inexplicable subtleties in the world.\r\n\r\nOne knows of many examples of people who are struck whose garments\r\nremain absolutely intact. The imponderable fluid insinuates itself\r\nthrough the garments, leaving no trace of its passage, and may cause\r\ngrave disorders in the body of a man without any exterior mark to\r\nreveal it to the most perspicacious observer.\r\n\r\nWe hear of the case of a man who had nearly the whole of his right\r\nside burnt from the arm to the foot, as though it had been for a long\r\ntime too near a quick fire, but his shirt, his pants, and the rest of\r\nhis clothes were untouched by the fire.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Pinel gives the case of a man who, amongst other injuries,\r\nhad his right foot very badly lacerated, while the left was untouched;\r\nthe right sabot was untouched, and the left was broken.\r\n\r\nOn June 10, 1895, at Bellenghise, near Saint-Quentin, a lady was\r\nkilled under a tree: she had deep marks of burning on the breast and\r\nstomach, but her clothes remained intact. Lightning is very\r\nmystifying.\r\n\r\nTh. Neale cites a case where the hands were burnt to the bone in\r\ngloves which remained intact!\r\n\r\nAt other times, garments, even those nearest the skin, are perforated,\r\nburnt, and torn, without the surface of the skin being injured.\r\n\r\nThus the boot of a man who had been struck was so torn that it was\r\nreduced to ashes, while there was no trace of a wound on the foot.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary case in point happened at Vabreas (Vaucluse) in July,\r\n1873. A peasant was in the fields when there was a violent clap of\r\nthunder. The electric fluid struck his head, shaved the left side, and\r\ncompletely burnt his hat. Then, continuing its route, it tore his\r\ngarments, penetrated the length of his legs, and tore his trousers\r\nfrom top to bottom. Finally, it transported the unfortunate man,\r\nnearly naked, six or seven yards from his original place, and laid him\r\non his stomach on a bush with his head hanging over the edge of a\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the garments are seriously injured, we find slight\r\ninjuries under the skin which do not always correspond to the places\r\nwhere the garment is most seriously affected.\r\n\r\nLichtenberg quotes the case of a man who had his clothes cut as by the\r\npoint of a knife from the shoulders to the feet, without the sign of a\r\nwound except a small sore on the foot under the buckle of the shoe.\r\n\r\nAccording to Howard, a man had his clothes torn to atoms without\r\nshowing any trace of the action of the electric fluid on the surface\r\nof his body, except a light mark on the forehead.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as we have already said, the inner garments are burnt while\r\nthe outer ones are respected.\r\n\r\nA woman had her chemise scorched by the fire of heaven, while her\r\ndress and petticoats were spared.\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 1774, lightning fell at Poitiers in a yard where a young\r\ncooper was working. It went under his right foot, burning his shoe,\r\npassed between his stocking and leg, singed the stocking without\r\nwounding the leg, burned the lining of his trousers, raised the\r\nepidermis of the abdomen, tore off a brass button which fastened his\r\ngarment, and went off to twist a carpenter round in a neighbouring\r\nlane. Neither one nor the other felt the effects of this stroke of\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nFinally, the clothes, above all the shoes, are unsewn carefully and\r\nwithout a tear, as though by the hand of a clever workman.\r\n\r\nHere are two cases in a thousand--\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1872, at Grange Forestière, near Petit-Creusot, a man had\r\nhis trousers unsewn from top to bottom and his shoes taken off.\r\n\r\nIn the department of Eure-et-Loire, some peasants were engaged in\r\nbinding sheaves, and their daughter, aged nine, was playing near them\r\nwhen a storm broke with great violence.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go in, I am frightened,\" she cried, running to take refuge\r\nbetween her parents.\r\n\r\n\"We will go in immediately, but we must finish binding before the rain\r\ncomes on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will beg of the Good God to keep the thunder from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while the father and mother continued their work, the child went\r\ndown on her knees, and with her hands over her eyes commenced her\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without hearing or seeing anything, the father felt the\r\nstraw move under his feet; he turned mechanically, and gave a great\r\ncry on seeing his little daughter stretched motionless on the ground.\r\nShe was dead. Her little corset was unsewn and her chemise burnt.\r\n\r\nBut of all the fantastic actions of lightning, the most extraordinary\r\nand incomprehensible is the mania it has for undressing its victims,\r\nand leaving them dead or fainting in the primitive costume of our\r\nfirst parents--or in a dress too simple to be allowed by our civilized\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nThis deplorable and quite inexplicable habit has given lightning a\r\nlarge scientific _dossier_, from which we have already cited examples\r\nin the first chapter, and from which we will again extract some\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nNear Angers, on May 12, 1901, a farm lad named Rousteau, aged\r\ntwenty-three, was killed by lightning in the middle of the fields. The\r\ncorpse was found nearly naked.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 1869, at Pradettes (Ariège), the Mayor was unfortunate\r\nenough to take shelter under a very high poplar. Soon after he had\r\ndone so, there was a burst of lightning which split the tree and\r\nstruck him. In one of its diabolical freaks it entirely undressed him,\r\nthrowing his various garments round about him, reduced to rags, with\r\nthe exception of one shoe.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1903, at Saint-Laurent-la-Gatine, thunder broke over M.\r\nFromentin while he was working a plough drawn by three horses.\r\nLightning killed the leader, and completely undressed M. Fromentin\r\nafter burning his hat.\r\n\r\nThe same day, at Limoges, a farm servant named Barcelot was struck\r\nunder an oak. His corpse was completely naked and he had a severe\r\nwound on his left side.\r\n\r\nOn August 20 of the same year, a violent storm burst over the Isle of\r\nRe. A farmer, who was on his way to the station at Finaud, was struck\r\nfifty yards from his own house. The lightning removed all his clothes.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the keeper of the Commune of Saint-Cyr-en-Val, near Orleans,\r\nwas struck while on his rounds; the fluid deprived him of his clothes\r\nand removed all the nails from one of his shoes.\r\n\r\nOn July 1903, at Aseras, near Nice, during a violent storm with\r\nhailstones 350 grammes in weight, a Mme. Blanc was on her way to meet\r\na servant who was in the fields. She had only taken a few steps when\r\nshe was struck by lightning and completely undressed. Her body was\r\nuninjured, but the poor woman became dumb.\r\n\r\nHow fantastic and extravagant it is! It is impossible to assign any\r\nrule to the capricious advance of lightning.\r\n\r\nHow are we to explain the following facts of nature?\r\n\r\nOne night in April, at about 6 p.m., near Ajaccio, a peasant named J.\r\nB. Pantaloni was leaving the fields and hurrying home to escape from a\r\nstorm. He had hardly reached his house when it was set on fire by an\r\nelectric discharge, and the unfortunate man was killed dead and\r\ncarbonized. At the same time his two sons and a daughter, who were in\r\nthe same room, were completely undressed and their garments\r\ndisappeared. These last were not hurt in any way.\r\n\r\nVery often clothes, which have been torn and tattered, are taken a\r\nlong way off.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, 1868, seven people were seeking shelter under an\r\nenormous beech near the village of Bonello in the Commune of Perret\r\n(Côtes-du-Nord), when, suddenly, lightning struck the tree and killed\r\none of them. The six others were thrown to the ground without being\r\nmuch hurt. The clothes of the one who had been struck were reduced to\r\ntatters; several of these were found hanging on the branches of the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nOne day a workman was sheltering under the shed of a kiosque in which\r\nthere were five men playing cards. He was grazed by lightning. The\r\nfluid, after having passed between the players without hurting them,\r\nleft the kiosque, and removed a shoe from the poor workman, who was\r\npetrified with fright. They searched for the shoe which had been\r\nconfiscated by the fulminant matter, but in vain.\r\n\r\nMoreover, lightning seems to have a special predilection for shoes; it\r\nseldom respects them, even when it spares the other garments. Sabots,\r\nshoes, and even boots are removed, unsewn, un-nailed, cut to pieces,\r\nand thrown far away with extraordinary violence. Very often the\r\ndischarge penetrates into the human body by the head and leaves it by\r\nthe feet.\r\n\r\nDuring a violent storm (June 8, 1868) a workman was passing near the\r\nJardin des Plantes, when he felt a great oppression on his stomach. He\r\nwas then knocked down roughly by an irresistible force, and deprived\r\nof the use of his senses at the moment of the fall. He was picked up\r\nand taken home, and on being examined, his body bore no trace of a\r\nwound, and he escaped with a fright. But some days after, when he had\r\nrecovered from the shock, he remembered that he had worn boots at the\r\ntime of the accident. These had disappeared, the lightning had stolen\r\nthem from him, though it acted from a distance. The boots were found\r\nin the street, and the soles had the nails completely removed,\r\nalthough they were screwed in and the boots were nearly new.\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 1904, at Villemontoire (Aisne), a workman was killed on a\r\nhay-cock, his clothes were reduced to fragments, and his shoes were\r\nnot to be found. Two other workmen were wounded, and the cock was set\r\non fire.\r\n\r\nOn May 11, 1893, lightning broke over the Commune of Chapelle-en-Blezy\r\n(Haute-Marne). A young shepherd, who was watching his flock in the\r\nfields, was knocked over by the fluid and lost consciousness. When he\r\ncame to himself he found that his sabots and cap had disappeared.\r\n\r\nArago states that a workman was struck under a pavilion, and that the\r\npieces of his hat were found embedded in the ceiling.\r\n\r\nBiot gives the case of a hat which was flung ten paces without a\r\nbreath of wind.\r\n\r\nWe could multiply these very curious observations, but we must\r\nrestrain ourselves so as to remain within the limits of this little\r\nbook. Did I not say just now that lightning has sometimes--though very\r\nrarely--exercised a beneficial influence on sick people it strikes?\r\n\r\nYes; we hear of several cases where thunder has shown itself a rival\r\nto the noblest disciples of Esculapius, and where it has worked\r\nveritable miracles.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a person who had been paralyzed thirty-eight years,\r\nsuddenly, at the age of forty-four, recovered the use of her legs,\r\nafter a stroke of lightning.\r\n\r\nA paralytic had been taking the curative waters of Tunbridge Wells for\r\ntwenty years, when the spark touched him and cured him of his terrible\r\ninfirmity.\r\n\r\nLightning has sometimes worked marvels on the blind, deaf, and dumb,\r\nto whom it restores sight, hearing, and speech.\r\n\r\nA man who had the whole of his left side paralyzed from infancy was\r\nstruck in his room on August 10, 1807. He lost consciousness for\r\ntwenty minutes, but after some days he gradually and permanently\r\nrecovered the use of his limbs. A weakness of the right eye also\r\ndisappeared, and the invalid could write without spectacles. On the\r\nother hand, he became deaf.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if we are to believe stories which appear to be authentic, a\r\ncold, a tumour, and rheumatism have been cured by lightning. We have\r\ngiven an example in our first chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to explain in what manner the subtle fluid\r\naccomplishes these wonderful cures. Are they to be attributed to the\r\nshock, to a general upheaval which brings back the circulation to its\r\nnormal course? Or are we to attribute to the electric substance--still\r\nunknown to physicians and physiologists--an action capable of\r\novercoming the most inveterate evils?\r\n\r\nThe science of Therapeutics already makes excellent use of the\r\nelectricity of the machines. Can we, then, marvel much that lightning\r\nshould rival our feeble electric resources? No! What a number of\r\nservices might it not render if it were not for its mad independence!\r\nWhat an amount of lost power there is in the gleam of lightning!\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, we owe no gratitude to lightning. There are too\r\nmany miseries for a few happy results. The balance is really too\r\nunequal.\r\n\r\nSome lightning strokes have proved veritable disasters, on account of\r\nthe number of the victims and the havoc which has been caused.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary of these are the following:--\r\n\r\nOn a feast-day lightning penetrated into a church near Carpentras.\r\nFifty people were killed or wounded or rendered imbecile.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 1717, lightning struck a church at Seidenburg, near Zittau,\r\nduring the service; forty-eight people were killed or wounded.\r\n\r\nOn June 26, 1783, lightning struck the church of Villars-le-Terroy,\r\nwhen its bells were being rung; it killed eleven people, and wounded\r\nthirteen.\r\n\r\nOn board the sloop _Sapho_, in February, 1820, six men were killed by\r\na stroke of lightning and fourteen seriously wounded.\r\n\r\nOn board the ship _Repulse_, near the shores of Catalonia, on April\r\n13, 1813, lightning killed eight men in the rigging and wounded nine,\r\nof whom several succumbed.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 1857, three hundred people were assembled in the church at\r\nGrosshad, a small village, two miles from Düren, when lightning struck\r\nit; one hundred people were wounded, thirty of them seriously. Six\r\nwere killed, and they were six hardy men.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, 1865, lightning fell on the territory of Coray\r\n(Finisterre) in a warren where sixteen people were weeding. Six men\r\nand a child were killed by the same stroke, and three others were\r\nseverely wounded. Several were stripped naked, their garments being\r\nscattered in rags over the ground; their shoes were cut to pieces and\r\nall broken. A curious point is that the workers were struck at a\r\ndistance of 100 yards from each other.\r\n\r\nOn July 12, 1887, at Mount Pleasant (Tennessee, U.S.A.), lightning\r\nkilled nine people who were taking refuge under an oak during a storm.\r\nThese formed part of a procession which was conducting a negress to\r\nher last home.\r\n\r\nHere is another very curious and complex case--\r\n\r\nOn the last Sunday in June, 1867, during Vespers, lightning struck a\r\nchurch at Dancé, Canton of Saint-Germain-Laval (Loire). A deathlike\r\nsilence succeeded the noise of the explosion, then a cry was heard,\r\nthen a hundred more. The curé, who thought that he alone had received\r\nthe whole electric discharge--and was in reality unhurt--left his\r\nplace, where he was enveloped in a cloud of dust and smoke, and spoke\r\nto his parishioners from the Communion rails, to reassure them. \"It is\r\nnothing,\" he said. \"Keep your places; there is no harm done.\"\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken; twenty-five to thirty people had been more or less\r\nstruck. Four were carried away unconscious, but the worst treated of\r\nall was the treasurer. In raising him they perceived that his eyes\r\nwere open, but dull and veiled, and he gave no sign of life. His\r\nclothes were burnt, and his shoes, which were torn and full of blood,\r\nwere removed from his feet.\r\n\r\nThe Monstrance, which had been exposed, had been thrown down on the\r\nground, and was battered and pierced in the stem, and the Host had\r\ndisappeared. The priest searched for it for a long time, and finally\r\ndiscovered it on the altar in the middle of the corporal, on a thick\r\nbed of rubbish.\r\n\r\nThree or four yards of the wainscoting of the choir had burnt into\r\natoms. Outside, the arrow of the belfry had been carried off, and its\r\nslates were scattered about in the neighbouring fields.\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 1902, lightning struck, the church of Pineiro (Province of\r\nOrense, Spain) during a funeral. There were twenty-five dead and\r\nthirty-five severely wounded.\r\n\r\nThese are cases of destruction on a large scale, but we can give\r\nparallel cases where the terrible fluid seems only to amuse itself.\r\n\r\nIn fact, some people appear to enjoy the privilege of particularly\r\nattracting lightning, and of frequently receiving its visits without\r\nsuffering much from its reiterated attacks.\r\n\r\nThey say that Mithridates was twice touched by lightning. The first\r\nstroke was when he was in his cradle, his swaddling clothes were\r\nsinged, and the scar of a burn which he received on his forehead was\r\ncovered with hair afterwards.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Abbé Richard, a lady, who lived in a château on an\r\nelevation near Bourgogne, saw the lightning several times enter her\r\nroom, divide itself into sparks of different sizes, of which the\r\ngreater part attached themselves to her clothes without burning them,\r\nand left livid traces on her arms and even on her thighs. She said,\r\nwhen speaking on this subject, that thunder had never done her more\r\nharm than to whip her two or three times, though it fell pretty often\r\non her château.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a sort of relative immunity in women and children.\r\nThese are seldom struck. We have even several examples of children\r\nremaining safe and sound in the arms of their mothers who are struck.\r\n\r\nFracastor's mother had her child to her breast when she was struck by\r\nlightning. The child itself was spared.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1853, at Georgetown (Essex), Mrs. Russel, wife of the\r\nProtestant minister, was killed by lightning, while a small child\r\nwhich she had in her arms was unhurt.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if lightning pitied the feeble--the women and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWe hear of cases where people were struck several times during the\r\nsame storm without succumbing to its manifold attacks.\r\n\r\n\"In two similar situations,\" says Arago, \"one man, according to the\r\nnature of his constitution, runs more risk than another. There are\r\nsome exceptional people who are not conductors to the fulminating\r\nmatter, and who neither receive nor pass on a shock. As a rule, they\r\nmust be ranked among the non-conductor bodies that the lightning\r\nrespects, or, at least, that it strikes rarely. Such decided\r\ndifferences could not exist without there being finer shades. Thus\r\neach degree of conductibility corresponds during the time of a storm\r\nto a certain degree of danger. The man who conducts like a metal will\r\nbe struck as often as a metal, while the man who cuts off the\r\ncommunication in the chain, will have almost as little to fear as if\r\nhe were made of glass or resin. Between these limits there will be\r\nfound individuals whom lightning might strike as it would strike wood,\r\nstones, etc. Thus, in the phenomena of lightning, everything does not\r\ndepend on the place that a man may occupy; his physical constitution\r\nwill have something to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe phantasmagoria of lightning leaves us perplexed. All these\r\nobservations are extraordinary and very disconcerting. The facts\r\ncontradict each other, and lead us to no actual conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe _Gazette de Cologne_ gave the following case in June, 1867:--\r\n\r\nAt Czempin, a young girl of eighteen was struck by lightning while she\r\nwas working near a hearth. She remained unconscious, in spite of all\r\nthe efforts made to revive her. At last, acting on the advice of an\r\nold man, they placed her in a freshly dug ditch, and covered her body\r\nwith earth, but in such a way as to avoid stifling her. After some\r\nhours she recovered consciousness, and was restored to health.\r\n\r\nSometimes lightning amuses itself nicely and innocently. It mixes in\r\nthe society of men without doing them harm, or leaving any remembrance\r\nbut a great fear.\r\n\r\nOne day lightning entered by the chimney into the middle of a lively\r\ndance at M. Van Gestien's, the innkeeper at Flone (Belgium). At the\r\nsight of it the dancers were petrified with terror, and not one could\r\ntry and escape. But they misunderstood the intentions of the\r\nlightning, which were of the most straightforward; it only wanted to\r\nbe a spoil-sport. It also had the good taste to depart quietly.\r\n\r\nAfter the first excitement a profound stupefaction seized hold of the\r\npersons present; they were all transformed into niggers. The lightning\r\nhad swept the chimney, and cast the soot into the ball-room, powdering\r\nall the faces and toilettes.\r\n\r\nLightning might be the daughter of goblins rather than a messenger\r\nfrom Olympus. The following facts might confirm this impression:--\r\n\r\nAt Bayonne, on June 6, 1873, lightning knocked over a gas-burner, and\r\nthrew a person down, after making her turn round three times. A family\r\nof twelve were gathered together at a table, sixty yards, at least,\r\nfrom the point where it burst. They were all knocked down, but without\r\nsustaining any injury.\r\n\r\nDuring a violent storm, lightning entered a country house by the\r\nchimney; it lifted two big stones from the hearth, and carried them\r\nover to near the head of a child who was asleep, and placed one on\r\neach side, without grazing it or hurting the child.\r\n\r\nAnd this same lightning, whose almost maternal delicacy is quite\r\nexquisite, entered another time, also by the chimney, into a house,\r\nhit a man savagely on the head, wounded him severely, and left him\r\ndead in the middle of a pool of blood. Then it took a quantity of this\r\nblood which was accumulated round his head, and went and stuck it on\r\nthe ceiling of the higher story. A child who was present at this\r\ntragic scene was unhurt.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1901, an electric spark penetrated into a house in the\r\nvillage of Porri, near Ajaccio, and started to make the tour of the\r\nproperty. First it visited the second-floor rooms, without doing much\r\ndamage there; then it went down to the first floor, where there were\r\ntwo young girls, turned them round, and burnt their legs. It continued\r\non its course as far as the cellar, where its dazzling brightness\r\nterrified three young children who had taken refuge there. It spared\r\ntwo, but burned the third rather severely.\r\n\r\nLet us finish this series of electric pictures, which\r\ndepict--sometimes in a very tragic manner--the different modes of\r\nactivity of one of the grandest of Nature's phenomena, by two facts,\r\nthe strangeness of which surpasses everything that one can imagine.\r\n\r\nPliny gives the case of a Roman lady, who, having been struck by\r\nlightning during her confinement, had a stillborn child, without\r\nherself suffering the least harm.\r\n\r\nAnother:--\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Richard, in his _Histoire de l'Air_, gives a more\r\nextraordinary case still. At Altenbourg, in Saxony, in July, 1713,\r\nlightning struck a woman who was expecting her confinement. She was\r\ndelivered some hours afterwards of a child who was half burnt, and\r\nwhose body was all black. The mother recovered her health.\r\n\r\nWe can neither define nor delimit the power of lightning. Sometimes\r\nmerciful, often cruel, it constitutes in the universality of its\r\nactions, one of Nature's most terrible scourges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF LIGHTNING ON ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimals, even more than mankind, attract the fire of heaven. Lightning\r\nhas a certain regard for human beings, which it seems to lose entirely\r\nwhen it is a case of the humble and faithful servants that Nature has\r\ngiven us.\r\n\r\nAnd, between ourselves, thunder is not always as absurd as it appears.\r\nIts proceedings are sometimes even very tactful. Though it may often\r\nstrike innocent victims blindly and ferociously; yet it seems at times\r\nto show a certain amount of intelligence. Thus we find among our many\r\nexamples a strange fact, which will serve to reconcile our thoughts a\r\nlittle to thunder.\r\n\r\nOn June 20, 1872, in Kentucky State, we have already cited the case of\r\nthe nigger Norris, who was going to be hanged for the murder of a\r\nmulatto companion, and who, just as he was putting his foot on the\r\nfatal platform, was struck by lightning, and thus spared the sheriff\r\nthe trouble of hurling him into eternity.\r\n\r\nHere was a case where thunder was full of justice, and we cannot\r\npraise it too much.\r\n\r\nArago gives another case where a chief of brigands was shut up in a\r\nBavarian prison, together with his accomplices. No doubt he was\r\nencouraging their arrogance by his blasphemies--the stone to which he\r\nwas attached acting as a tribune for him--when he was suddenly struck\r\nby lightning while haranguing his disciples. He fell dead. The iron\r\nmanacles had brought on the disaster, but the brigands did not stop to\r\nthink of this natural cause; they were just as terrified as if the\r\niron had not been there, and the lightning had chosen its victim with\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nHere is another instance--\r\n\r\nThe favourite of a prince had obtained from him a written recognition\r\nof her son. She counted on this to give trouble to the State after the\r\ndeath of her benefactor. She enclosed it carefully in a chest, and\r\nwent and buried it deep in a wood, hoping to render all search\r\nuseless, if the prince should change his mind.\r\n\r\nBut behold, the lightning intervened; the tree was struck, and the\r\nopen chest was thrown on the highway, where it was found by a peasant.\r\n\r\nAnimals are worse treated than men, but better than plants and\r\ninorganic bodies. What are the causes of this difference? Can we\r\nattribute it to physical predisposition? But this has not yet been\r\nproved. Experience shows that sparks directed on the vertebral column\r\nare particularly dangerous. Now, the backs of quadrupeds are greatly\r\nexposed to mortal strokes from the celestial fire.\r\n\r\nTheir fur or their plumage, which form an intrinsic part of their\r\nbodies, put them more or less in the situation of a man who, to\r\nprotect himself from inclemency, should envelop himself in his hair,\r\nsupposing this to be long enough and rich enough to cover him\r\ndecently.\r\n\r\nAnimals rarely survive when struck. When they do not die on the spot,\r\nthey succumb soon after to their wounds. The ancients have remarked on\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\"Man,\" says Pliny, \"is the only animal that lightning does not always\r\nkill; all the others die on the spot. It is a prerogative granted to\r\nhim by Nature, though so many animals surpass him in strength.\" And,\r\nfurther on, he adds that amongst birds the eagle is never struck. This\r\nhas given it the name of _porte foudre_.\r\n\r\nBut these assertions are slightly exaggerated, and we can quote a\r\ncertain number of examples of animals which have resisted the baneful\r\ninfluence of the electric current.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, a horse was touched by lightning, which was certainly\r\nattracted by the iron of his shoe. It traced two deep trails right\r\nalong the animal's leg, where the skin was abrased, and appeared as\r\nthough it were cauterized. These two lines joined together at the fold\r\nof the ham, and then formed a single furrow, all sign of which was\r\nlost in the abdominal region. The rest of the body was unhurt, and the\r\nanimal sustained no further harm after being struck than it would have\r\ndone if an incompetent veterinary surgeon had fired him too severely.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1884, at Castres, ten persons and nine horses were struck\r\nby lightning; all survived the accident.\r\n\r\nOn June 9, 1886, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, three cows and a\r\nlittle girl, who was in charge of them, were knocked over by a violent\r\nshock. The child and the beasts soon got up. Only an ox was killed\r\nsome distance from there.\r\n\r\nVery often horses are stunned by the discharge on animals which are\r\nkilled, but after a time they recover. This phenomenon has also been\r\nobserved in other animals. For instance, five or six pigs which were\r\nin a cage in the prow of a ship were killed by an electric discharge,\r\nwhilst others which were only separated from them by a cloth were\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nBut the cases are rare in which animals do not succumb to lightning.\r\nThey nearly always perish. At present we will only discuss animals as\r\na body, equal, or superior to man. The others, the smaller ones,\r\noffer a still more convincing generality.\r\n\r\nAll animals seem to be greatly exposed to the wrath of Jupiter;\r\nnevertheless, some species appear to be peculiarly sensitive to\r\nlightning--the gentle sheep, for example, which huddle together\r\nfraternally during a storm, and fall in a mass, struck by the fire of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nI have before me a list of animals which have been struck. There are\r\nsome of every kind. We might divide them thus--\r\n\r\n    Several hundred rams, sheep, and ewes.\r\n    73 horses, mares, and colts.\r\n    71 oxen, cows, or bulls.\r\n    9 dogs.\r\n    4 asses.\r\n    3 goats.\r\n    3 cats.\r\n    3 mules.\r\n    2 pigs.\r\n    1 hare.\r\n    1 squirrel.\r\n\r\nA prodigious quantity of geese, chickens, pigeons, and small birds.\r\n\r\nFish also contribute a respectable contingent to lightning.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, large groups of animals are dangerous when there is\r\nthunder, as they seem to exercise a strong attractive influence to the\r\nelectric fluid.\r\n\r\nOften entire herds are destroyed by lightning. Dr. Boudin gives the\r\nfollowing example:--\r\n\r\nOn May 11, 1865, at about 6.30 p.m., Hubert Wera, a shepherd who was\r\nsurprised in the fields when a storm overtook him, was hurrying home\r\nwith his flock. On coming to a narrow and difficult road, the sheep\r\nformed themselves into two groups. The shepherd took shelter behind a\r\nbush, when a terrible clap of thunder was heard. Lightning struck him\r\nand his flock. The unfortunate man was struck on the top of his head.\r\nAll his hair had been taken from the nape of his neck, and the\r\nelectric fluid had traced a ridge on his forehead, his face, and\r\nbreast. His body was quite naked; all his clothes were reduced to\r\nrags. Moreover, there was no trace of blood. The iron of his crook had\r\nbeen detached from the handle and thrown several yards away, and the\r\nhandle itself was broken to pieces. A small metal crucifix and a\r\nscapular belonging to the unfortunate shepherd were found fifteen\r\nyards away.\r\n\r\nOf the flock of 152 sheep, 126 were killed. They were covered with\r\nblood, and their wounds were as varied as they were peculiar. Some had\r\ntheir heads chopped, others had them pierced from side to side, others\r\nhad their legs fractured. As to the dog, he was not to be found.\r\n\r\nOn May 13, 1803, near Fehrbellin (Prussian States), one clap of\r\nthunder killed a shepherd and 40 sheep.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1826, thunder killed 64 hairy beasts in a field at Gulpin\r\n(Limbourg).\r\n\r\nAt Prades, on July 28, 1890, 340 sheep were struck at one blow.\r\n\r\nDuring a violent storm which burst over Montmaur in the Isère,\r\nlightning struck a flock of 90 sheep, and killed 53.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April, 1869, thunder burst over a sheepfold in which\r\nthere were 80 sheep.\r\n\r\nFifty of these were found entirely carbonized, the thirty others were\r\ncovered with sores, on the head, in the eyes, and on the back, and\r\nhalf asphyxiated by the fulminant fluid. The poor sheep were all\r\ncowering together.\r\n\r\nOn August 11, 1905, a flock of sheep were carbonized, and cattle of\r\nevery kind were struck.\r\n\r\nAt Limoges, on July 4, 1884, 42 cows or oxen were struck by the spark.\r\nThey were all joined together by an iron chain.\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 1822, near Hayengen (Wurtemberg), a shepherd and 216 sheep\r\nout of 288, were struck in the open field.\r\n\r\nLastly, according to Abbadie, a storm in Ethiopia killed in one single\r\nstroke, 2000 goats and their shepherd. These figures are, I think,\r\nsufficiently eloquent, and if it were not for fear of fatiguing my\r\nreaders, who might become bored, we could add a great many similar\r\nexamples to this list. But it would be superfluous to expatiate\r\nfurther on the dangers incurred in a storm by large agglomerations of\r\nanimals. In their terror, beasts, particularly sheep, press closely\r\ntogether, and are soaked by the rain. In this way they offer a large\r\nsurface, which absolutely conducts the lightning. Also the column of\r\nvapour which rises from these living masses, affords an excellent\r\npassage for the fluid to pass through while crossing over the bodies\r\nof the poor beasts. It would be better to disperse the flock, rather\r\nthan form a compact group of them, during a storm.\r\n\r\nOne sometimes wonders also what would be the effect of lightning on\r\nanimals arranged in a file. Would it act the same with atmospheric\r\nelectricity as with that in our laboratories? Would the influence of\r\nthe electric matter be more dangerous in the extremities than in the\r\nmiddle?\r\n\r\nWhen lightning meets a metallic bar, it does no harm except on\r\nentering and departing. On the other hand, when several people form a\r\nchain, holding hands, if the first touches the body of a Leyden\r\nelectrical jar and the last touches the top, the whole circle will\r\ninstantaneously receive a shock. Only those in the middle receive a\r\nless violent one than those who touch the jar. Well, the discharges\r\nfrom the clouds produce similar effects on men and animals.\r\n\r\nArago supports this by the following facts:--\r\n\r\nAt Flavigny (Côte-d'Or), five horses were in a stable when the\r\nlightning penetrated. The two first and the two last perished, the\r\nfifth, which was in the middle, was unhurt.\r\n\r\nOne day lightning fell on an open field on five horses in a line and\r\nkilled the first and last; the three others were spared.\r\n\r\nBut we should require a much larger number of proofs before we could\r\nbe sure of this.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, lightning, always fantastic and extraordinary, seems\r\nto make a fastidious choice of its victims. It kills one, spares\r\nanother, strikes a third, does good to a fourth--what a strange game!\r\nhow fantastic!\r\n\r\nMadame la Comtesse Mycielska, of the Duchy of Posen, wrote to me\r\nrecently--\r\n\r\n\"During a storm which took place in the month of August, 1901,\r\nlightning entered by a half-open door into a stable where there were\r\ntwenty cows, and killed ten. Beginning with that which was nearest the\r\ndoor, the second was spared, the third killed, the fourth was\r\nuninjured, and so on. All the uneven numbers were killed, the others\r\nwere not even burnt. The shepherd who was in the stable at the time of\r\nthe shock, got up unhurt. The lightning did not burn the building,\r\nalthough the stable was full of straw.\"\r\n\r\nWe have given a similar case in the chapter on Fireballs. _A propos_\r\nof this, M. Elisee Duval, of Criquetot l'Esneval (Seine-Inférieure),\r\nrelates a very remarkable case. On June 20, 1892, lightning fell on\r\nthe telegraph poles of Havre and Étretat. A dozen were thrown over,\r\nand the curious part is that every second one was knocked down.\r\n\r\nHere is a more extraordinary case still. We were not aware that\r\nthunder could distinguish between colours, and that it has its\r\npreferences amongst them. Well, we need no longer be surprised at\r\nthis. Here we have a case where the fluid declares itself distinctly\r\nin favour of black. It was at Lapleau in Corrèze. One day thunder fell\r\non a grange full of hay and straw, and covered with thatch, without\r\nsetting it on fire. Then it went to the sheepfold and killed seven\r\nblack sheep, and left the white alone.\r\n\r\nThis choice is categorical, and people who fear lightning might follow\r\nthis example by wearing long white garments in a storm. Unfortunately,\r\nlightning is so eccentric and uncertain, that we must not defy it; it\r\nis not to be trusted.\r\n\r\nWho can explain why it sometimes glides into a stable full of cows\r\nwithout injuring one? This extraordinary thing happened in the Commune\r\nof Grignicourt (Marne).\r\n\r\nAfter a great clap of thunder, all the cows that were in a shed became\r\nunfastened, without one of them being hurt.\r\n\r\nThere, again, the lightning only seemed to want to make itself useful.\r\n\r\nIf, in some cases, by a providential chance, cattle have been saved,\r\nit is none the less true that an animal very rarely survives a\r\ndischarge which has caused the death of a human being.\r\n\r\nBut, as there is no rule without exceptions, we will give the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nThe sky was dark and lowering, and a shepherd, seeing that there was\r\nabout to be a storm, ran to his flock to drive it to the shed. Just at\r\nthe same moment, lightning burst and knocked him down, together with\r\nthirty sheep. The beasts all got up soon, but the poor shepherd was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, on June 13, 1893, a shepherd was killed by\r\nlightning, and the remarkable thing was that only one sheep out of the\r\nhundred of the flock was struck.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1883, thunder entered a sheepfold, containing one hundred\r\nsheep. Only four perished. One of them was marked on the back with a\r\ncross, formed of two rectilinear grooves, penetrating to the skin;\r\nonly the wool was removed.\r\n\r\nSometimes, but very rarely, men and animals survive the discharge.\r\n\r\nThus, Dr. Brillouet's horse was thrown into a ditch, and remained\r\nthere without moving for three-quarters of an hour, after which he\r\nwas able to get up. Later on he became very feeble in the legs.\r\n\r\nVery often the same stroke kills men and animals simultaneously. We\r\nhave already given several cases of this kind. Here are some more--\r\n\r\nA terrible storm burst at La Salvetat, on August 26, 1900. A shepherd\r\nand his flock, composed of twenty-three sheep, were all killed by\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 1887, a young boy, fifteen years of age, living at\r\nMontagnat (Ain), was struck while fastening oxen to the door of a\r\nstable; an ox was also killed.\r\n\r\nAt Lagraulière (Corrèze), on August 15, 1862, three girls were looking\r\nafter their flocks. A violent storm burst at about five o'clock, and\r\nthe thunder growled terribly. The shepherdesses, taken by surprise,\r\nhad no time to take their flocks in. The two first took shelter under\r\na big chestnut, the third under an oak twenty-five yards away from\r\nthem. Suddenly lightning struck the chestnut and enveloped the two\r\nlittle refugees. They fell dead. The third fainted, half asphyxiated\r\nby the smell of the sulphur. The clothes of the two unfortunate girls\r\nwho had been struck were burnt, their sabots were broken. Near them\r\nthere were five sheep, a pig, and a she-ass, which had also been\r\nkilled by the fluid. The shepherdess's dog had been cut in two.\r\n\r\nSometimes, also, the clap of thunder, when striking men and animals,\r\nproves more murderous for the latter than the former, who, however,\r\nhave sometimes succumbed.\r\n\r\nA diligence was slowly mounting an incline, when suddenly a stroke of\r\nlightning interrupted its ascent. An electric ball burst over the\r\nheads of the horses, and threw the whole five down, stone dead. The\r\npostillion was struck, but not one other person was touched, though\r\nthe carriage was full of women and children.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity about this incident which ought to attract\r\nour attention--the terrible meteor was not accompanied by any emission\r\nof light, nor followed by any reverberation of sound.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1872, at about two in the afternoon, a farmer at\r\nGrange-Forestière was trying a couple of oxen, which he had just\r\nbought at the fair, in a field. Lightning knocked over the man and the\r\nanimals. Some hours after, the poor farmer was picked up in a pitiable\r\nplight. His hair was burnt in parts, also hair on his chest, he was\r\nquite deaf, and in a state of absolute prostration. His trousers were\r\nunsewn from top to bottom in all four stitchings, his hat was riddled\r\nwith holes, and his shoes torn off. All the same, he survived the\r\naccident. The oxen were killed on the spot.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as we have already said, when the spark strikes men and\r\nanimals at the same time, only the former can resist the shock.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1855, thunder burst over a flock of sheep in the Commune of\r\nSaint-Leger-la-Montagne (Haute Vienne); seventy-eight sheep and two\r\nwatch-dogs were killed on the spot. A woman who was looking after the\r\nflock was slightly touched.\r\n\r\nOn September 26, 1820, lightning struck a labourer who was driving\r\nnear Sainte Menehould. His two horses were killed; the man escaped\r\nwith a temporary deafness.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1852, two out of four oxen were killed, the third was\r\nparalyzed on the left side. As to the farmer, he came off with a\r\nnumbness of the left leg.\r\n\r\nVery often a man feels nothing, not even a shock, while the animals\r\nbeside him fall dead.\r\n\r\nHere are some facts--\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 1859, a herd of pigs were surprised by a water-spout\r\nnear Liége. One hundred and fifty of these animals perished by the\r\naction of the electric fluid, their guides felt nothing.\r\n\r\nIn 1715, lightning fell on the Abbey of Noirmoutiers, near Tours, and\r\nkilled twenty-two horses without doing any harm to 150 monks, whose\r\nrefectory it visited and upset the 150 bottles containing their ration\r\nof wine.\r\n\r\nIn the year IX., lightning killed a horse and a mule near Chartres,\r\nsparing the miller who conducted them.\r\n\r\nOn July 17, 1895, four cows were going along a road, when suddenly\r\nthey were pushed and thrown roughly to the edge of the road. The old\r\ndrover who was with them felt nothing except the sensation of a strong\r\nand very characteristic odour which he could not define.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, a fulgurant discharge took place near Mr. Cowen's and killed\r\nhis dog beside him, without doing him any harm.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1900, lightning penetrated into a cart-shed, where twelve\r\nchickens were taking shelter. The poor things were killed, but a lady\r\nwho was feeding them was unhurt.\r\n\r\nOne often asks if lightning strikes birds in flight. This question, so\r\noften put, would seem to find an answer in the following facts:--\r\n\r\nA lady was looking out of her window, when there was a flash of\r\nlightning, accompanied by a great clap of thunder. At the same time\r\nshe noticed on the grass a dead gull which she had not seen before.\r\nThe people who picked up the bird, affirmed that they found it still\r\nhot, and they added that there was a strong smell of sulphur.\r\n\r\nExamples of this kind are rare: we have two more--\r\n\r\nOne day, Mr. W. Murdochs with two friends was looking on at a very\r\nviolent storm, which spread itself over the Valley of the Ayr. Just\r\nthen his dog dislodged a flock of ducks which had been sheltered\r\nbehind an old building. One of the birds began to fly, and as it was\r\ncutting through the air, it was struck by lightning and killed as\r\nthough by a gun.\r\n\r\nDuring a storm in the United States, Mr. Burch saw a flock of wild\r\ngeese flying by. Suddenly there was a flash of lightning which threw\r\nthe flock into disorder; six birds fell dead to the ground.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that the absence of all communication with the\r\nground ought to protect the graceful winged tribe from lightning; but\r\nno, the poor birds have received no mercy from this terrible\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nAll the same, lightning is less redoubtable for them than the\r\nsportsman's gun. It is very seldom that the kings of the air are the\r\nvictims of the fire of Heaven, but they have another enemy, barbarous,\r\nunpardonable Man. Yes, the little earthly Jupiters are infinitely more\r\nterrible for the bird-world than the giant of the gods. They are\r\nrarely softened by the seductive grace, the elegance, and the\r\ndelightful twittering of the charming inhabitants of space.\r\n\r\nIn truth, one of the reasons why birds are so rarely struck in their\r\nflight is that they foresee the storm, and have the prudence to take\r\nshelter before it bursts.\r\n\r\nAmongst birds, sparrows are those which suffer most from the electric\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes find them hanging by their shrivelled claws from\r\ntelegraph wires or from the branches of trees. But this latter is\r\nrather rare. They generally nest high in the trees, and lightning\r\naffects the branches much less than the trunk.\r\n\r\nWe also hear of little caged birds being killed in their iron prison.\r\nOne day a canary was in a cage with five others and was killed; the\r\nrest were unhurt. The spark was attracted by the metallic bars, and\r\nstruck the canary, which was no doubt resting on iron.\r\n\r\nFishes in their dark dwellings are no more privileged than other\r\nanimals. They also frequently receive visits from the lightning, and\r\ntheir sad fate has often proved how dangerous it is to remain near a\r\npool or pond during thunder.\r\n\r\nMoreover, why are we recommended always to put the conductor into a\r\nwell, damp earth, or even into a small pond? It is because water\r\nconducts the electric substance admirably.\r\n\r\nWe can understand that a vast space of liquid would be a good refuge\r\nfor lightning, when, after having made several victims on earth, and\r\nfearing the vengeance of the conductors, it hurls itself into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nMore often it drowns itself, and in this it follows the example of the\r\nimmortal Gribouille; but enough of that. The logic of lightning is\r\nstill contestable.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, many examples show us the dangers to which the\r\ndenizens of rivers, and of the liquid element generally, are exposed.\r\nNot only are fishermen and sailors unanimous in attesting to the\r\nravages wrought by lightning, but the history of electricity has\r\npreserved the recollection of memorable disasters, of veritable\r\nhecatombs of fish, which they attribute to the fire of heaven.\r\n\r\nArago recounts that on September 17, 1772, lightning fell on the Doubs\r\nand killed all the pike and trout which were in the river. The water\r\nwas soon covered with their corpses which floated, stomach upwards.\r\n\r\nA century before, during the year 1672, the lake in the subterranean\r\npart of Zirknitz was the theatre of a similar event, even more\r\nterrible, on account of the number of victims. The inhabitants of the\r\nneighbourhood collected such a number of fish that were struck, that\r\nthey were able to fill eighteen carts.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, during a violent storm at night, the electric discharge fell\r\non a little fish-pond in which a number of fish sported. The next\r\nmorning they were all found floating dead on the surface of the water.\r\nThey had the appearance of boiled fish, and their flesh fell to pieces\r\non being touched, just as it would if it had been cooked. There was no\r\ninjury to be seen, external or internal. The scales and the swimming\r\nbladder, which was full of air, had been preserved. The water of the\r\npond remained troubled and muddy the day after the storm, as though\r\nthe agitation of the tempest had been quite recent.\r\n\r\nHere is an observation, similar to the last:--\r\n\r\nIn 1894, lightning fell on two poplars near Ignon, in the territory of\r\nSaulx-le-Duc (Côte-d'Or). A neighbouring pond, which measured 10 yards\r\nin length by 5 in width, was also struck. The owner states that all\r\nthe fish, to the number of about a thousand, were killed.\r\n\r\nAnother more curious case still:--\r\n\r\nOne day the fish in an aquarium placed in a drawing-room were struck.\r\nThey were all found lying dead on the floor. The glass which formed\r\nthe bottom of the vessel was twisted and coated with a thick bed of\r\nyellowish substance.\r\n\r\nIf we study the effects of lightning on animals from the point of view\r\nof the injuries which it produces, we can make some very interesting\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nMore often the hair of animals is injured or burnt. Sometimes the\r\nspark acts on the skin over a large surface of the body of the animal.\r\nThus, two horses had their hair singed nearly all over their bodies,\r\nand more particularly on the leg and under the stomach. At other times\r\nthe hair is only burnt in certain places.\r\n\r\nLightning struck a young four-year-old ox which was red with white\r\nspots. It burnt and removed all the white spots and left the red\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nBut generally we find one or more furrows of different kinds. The skin\r\nis seldom intact under injured hair. It is nearly always more or less\r\nburnt. And one often notices extravasations of blood which correspond\r\nto the injuries of the epidermis, in the subcutaneous cellular tissue.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the fulminant fluid only attacks the colour of the hair\r\nof the animal.\r\n\r\nThe fracture of the bones or the ablation of a limb is often observed\r\non animals which have been struck.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, a violent storm broke near Nimegue, and several oxen were\r\nkilled in the meadows and their bones were broken.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, 1718, in the Marche de Priegnitz, eight sheep\r\nwere struck. They could not be used as food, because all their bones\r\nhad been broken as though in a mortar, and the fragments were\r\nintermingled in the flesh. These, however, remained intact.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the preceding chapter that fulguration often leaves no\r\nparticular sign on men who are struck. It is the same with animals.\r\nThe electric fluid entirely absorbs the source of life and only leaves\r\ninsignificant traces of its passage. Sometimes even we can find no\r\nexterior injury.\r\n\r\nOn July 7, 1779, near Hamburg, lightning killed two horses in their\r\nstable. They showed no exterior trace of a burn, though both had a\r\nrupture of the auricles.\r\n\r\nIn the month of September, 1787, at Ogenne, two cows and a heifer were\r\nstruck in their stable; no exterior wound was to be found on their\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nAnother observation is given by the Abbé Chapsal in his remarkable\r\ndescription of the effects of lightning. A pig fell dead, struck by a\r\nclap of thunder, and no indication could be found of the electric\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nWe see that lightning does not always make a great distinction between\r\nthe blows which it inflicts on men and those which it inflicts on\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nSometimes, also, the corpses of beasts which are struck are completely\r\nincinerated. At the first sight, the body appears intact, but when you\r\ntouch it, it falls to pieces.\r\n\r\nAt Clermont (Oise) on June 2, 1903, several animals were entirely\r\ncarbonized in their stable.\r\n\r\nWe have also heard of animals being transported by the meteor a long\r\nway from the place of the catastrophe. Others have suffered from grave\r\nnervous troubles, following on the strokes of lightning which they\r\nhave received. Sometimes partial or total paralysis results. Thus, a\r\ncow which had been struck by lightning, was knocked over, and remained\r\na quarter of an hour motionless, after which it was seized with\r\nviolent convulsions, then it got up quickly looking terrified.\r\n\r\nHere is a case of a severe shock which brought on an access of\r\ndelirium.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a terrible storm on September 4, 1849, a butcher,\r\naccompanied by a dog, took refuge under a beech at the edge of the\r\nroad. Suddenly lightning fell on the tree and struck the dog, which\r\nbecame mad, and threw itself on its master, bit him in the thigh, and\r\nonly let go when the butcher dragged the animal with him into a\r\nneighbouring house and cut his tail. The dog died in the night.\r\n\r\nThere are some examples of injuries wrought on animals which are\r\nbarely perceptible. For instance, when it makes a transparent horn,\r\nopaque, and when it burns the mucous membrane of the nose.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the foetus which sleeps under the frail covering of\r\nthe egg, is exposed to the pitiless blows of the most terrible meteor,\r\nas is the baby in its mother's womb. Chickens have often been struck\r\nbefore they ever saw the light of day.\r\n\r\nOften the noise of thunder, and the fear which results from it, causes\r\nthe miscarriage of hinds, and particularly of lambs.\r\n\r\nAn animal which has been struck generally sinks instantly, without a\r\nstruggle. All the same, we hear of the case of a horse which was\r\nstruck by the flame, and which struggled for a long time against an\r\ninevitable death.\r\n\r\nThe corpses of animals, like those of men, are sometimes very rigid;\r\nat others they are soft and flaccid, and decompose rapidly.\r\n\r\nThus all the sheep of a flock which were together under a tree in\r\nScotland, were killed by a great clap of thunder. The next morning the\r\nowner, wishing to get some advantage out of their remains, sent his\r\nmen to skin them, but the bodies were already in such a state of\r\ndecomposition, and the stench was so abominable, that it was\r\nimpossible for the servants to execute his orders. They hurried to\r\nbury the sheep in their skins.\r\n\r\nOn September 10, 1845, at about 2 p.m., lightning fell on a house in\r\nthe village of Salagnac (Creuse). Amongst other accidents it killed a\r\npig in a stable; three hours after the body was completely decomposed.\r\n\r\nWhen animals are killed, not by the atmospheric fluid, but by the\r\nlightning of our machines, decomposition always comes on very rapidly.\r\n\r\nBrown Sequard made the following very curious experiment on this\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\nHe took the hearts away from five rabbits of the same kind, the same\r\nage, and about the same strength. He put one aside without touching\r\nit, and he submitted the four others to the passage of an electric\r\ncurrent, of a different strength for each animal. Here are the\r\ndifferent results obtained--\r\n\r\nThe first animal became rigid after ten hours, and its rigidity, which\r\nwas excessively marked, lasted eight days. The rigidity of the four\r\nothers was feebler, and lasted a shorter time in proportion to the\r\nstrength of the electric current. Thus, the one which received the\r\nweakest current, became rigid at the end of seven hours, and this\r\nlasted six days. The one which received the strongest current became\r\nrigid in seven minutes, and its body softened after a quarter of an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThis experiment explains the absence, or the shortness in duration, of\r\ncorpselike stiffness in subjects which have been subjected to the\r\nterrible discharge of lightning.\r\n\r\nAnimals are not only the frequent victims of lightning, but, as this\r\nexperiment shows, they are still oftener the martyrs of science.\r\nLaboratories are sometimes transformed into small cemeteries, where\r\nlie poor guineapigs, frogs which have been quartered, and mutilated\r\nrabbits. But what is the ordinary lot of these last when science\r\nspares them? The chief point is not to let the innocent victims\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nCan we eat with impunity the flesh of animals which have been struck?\r\nSeveral people say Yes, many say No. Both are right.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the question of the rapid putrefaction to which these\r\nbodies are nearly always subjected, the flesh of animals killed by\r\nfulguration has often been found unhealthy and uneatable.\r\n\r\nA veterinary surgeon who was commissioned to examine the bodies of two\r\ncows and an ox which had been struck in a stable, declared that their\r\nflesh could not be eaten without danger.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Franklin recounts how some people ate fowls which\r\nhad been killed by the electric spark--\"this funny little\r\nlightning\"--and cooked immediately after death. The flesh of these\r\ncapons was excellent and particularly tender, and the illustrious\r\ninventor of lightning-conductors concluded by proposing that we should\r\nfollow this proceeding in order to ensure our fresh meat being as\r\nclean as possible when served at table.\r\n\r\nWe think, however, that it is more prudent to sacrifice the meat which\r\nhas been struck, as it has been proved that in certain cases the\r\ndecomposition is very rapid.\r\n\r\nUp to now we have seen all animals, man included, as victims of\r\nlightning: it is the general rule.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we often meet beings in this world, men, animals, or\r\nplants, which try to distinguish themselves from others by some sort\r\nof originality. This appears to be the case with the electric fish,\r\nwhose existence seems to be dedicated to the worship of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThese curious fish have received the gift from Nature of being able to\r\nhurl lightning to a certain distance.\r\n\r\nThis is how they set to work. A little fish in search of food goes too\r\nnear this terrible enemy, who at once sets his living tail in motion.\r\nFascinating it with his eye, he renders it immovable, and lets fly\r\nrepeated discharges to it. After a minute, the poor fish is overcome,\r\nand allows itself to be snapped up by its pitiless adversary without\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nCertain rivers in Asia and Africa and the depths of the Pacific Ocean,\r\nin which these curious animals live, are often the scenes of terrible\r\ndramas, caused by the presence of these lightning fish, which are\r\ndivided into five species: the tetrodon, the trichiure, the silurus,\r\nthe raie torpille (cramp-fish), and the gymnote (electric eel). These\r\naquatic lightnings work terrible havoc among the inhabitants of\r\nNeptune's kingdom. They use their influence over men as well as fish.\r\nIf you touch a torpille, you feel a shock strong enough to benumb and\r\nparalyze the arm for some minutes.\r\n\r\nA curious experiment was tried: eight people formed a chain, and one\r\nof them, with a piece of metallic wire, touched the back of a torpille\r\nwhich had been imported. They all felt the shock.\r\n\r\nIf thunder had elected to be domiciled anywhere but in its own\r\nclouds, it would seem as if it would be in the organism of these\r\ncurious fish.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in our international relations, humanity has invented a\r\nmuch more dangerous torpille (torpedo)!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF LIGHTNING ON TREES AND PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly two thousand years ago, Pliny wrote, \"As regards products of\r\nthe earth, lightning never strikes the bay tree.\" And this is why the\r\nRoman emperors, in fear always of the fire of heaven, crowned\r\nthemselves with laurels. This belief was almost universal in ancient\r\ntimes, and survived for many centuries.\r\n\r\nBut every new century has proclaimed the immunity from lightning of\r\nsome one member of the vegetable world, though impartial research has\r\nnow established the fact that there is no such absolute privilege. If\r\ncertain trees are rarely struck, that is, perhaps, due less to its\r\nspecies than to its size, its hygrometrical condition, and to other\r\ninfluences which it is still difficult to specify; for lightning, as\r\nwe have seen, has capricious habits which we have not yet succeeded in\r\nexplaining.\r\n\r\nThus the bay tree has lost its proud position in this respect, and has\r\nhad to take its place amongst the ordinary run of trees, subject to\r\nthe unjust anger of Jupiter. Many bay trees of some size have been\r\nseen to fall victims to the electric fluid.\r\n\r\nThe fig tree, the mulberry tree, and the peach tree have also been\r\nreputed to enjoy safety, but this also is not the case. There is an\r\ninstance on record of a fig tree being struck by lightning and\r\ncompletely withered, and another of a mulberry-tree, eighty years old,\r\nbeing partly destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn our own days, the beech is believed to go uninjured. In the State\r\nof Tennessee, in the United States, the opinion is so deeply rooted\r\nthat beech tree plantations are often resorted to as a refuge in times\r\nof storm. But it would be a mistake to place too much trust in them.\r\nThere are records of beech trees being struck by lightning and\r\ndestroyed, just like bay trees, fig trees, and the rest.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, an old beech tree was struck in the forest of\r\nVillers-Cotterets. This venerable patriarch was more than three\r\nhundred years old. Of its upper branches, which were wide and strong,\r\nfour of the finest were destroyed; a fifth, stripped of its bark to a\r\ngreat extent, was not torn off the trunk. The trunk was split where\r\nthe other four branches were torn from it. The interior of it was\r\nblackened and slightly carbonized.\r\n\r\nOn July 15, 1868, at Chéfresne, canton de Percy (Manche), an oak and\r\nan ash were struck by lightning within five minutes of each other.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 1886, at Haute-Croix, in Brabant, an ash was struck and\r\ndestroyed. On August 23, in the same year, an ash was struck also at\r\nNamur.\r\n\r\nThe box tree and the Virginian creeper used to be regarded as\r\nsafeguards against lightning. The same virtue was attributed to the\r\nhouse-leek, a thick herbaceous plant, which grows usually upon walls\r\nand roofs, and which the Germans call Donnerblatt or Donnerbarb,\r\nThunder-leaf or Thunder-beard.\r\n\r\nAccording to some authors, again, lightning never strikes resinous\r\ntrees, such as pines or firs. But this also is disproved by the facts,\r\nespecially in regard to firs.\r\n\r\nAmong the many particulars I have collected of recent years, is the\r\nfollowing list of sixty-five different kinds of trees, with the record\r\nof the number of times each species has been struck by lightning\r\nwithin a given period:--\r\n\r\n    54 oaks.\r\n    24 poplars.\r\n    14 elms.\r\n    11 walnut trees.\r\n    10 firs.\r\n    7 willows.\r\n    6 pine trees.\r\n    6 ash trees.\r\n    6 beech trees.\r\n    4 pear trees.\r\n    4 cherry trees.\r\n    4 chestnut trees.\r\n    3 catalpas.\r\n    2 lime trees.\r\n    2 apple trees.\r\n    1 mountain ash.\r\n    1 mulberry tree.\r\n    1 alder.\r\n    1 laburnum.\r\n    1 acacia.\r\n    1 pseudo-acacia.\r\n    1 fig tree.\r\n    1 orange tree\r\n    1 olive tree.\r\n    0 birch.\r\n    0 maple.\r\n\r\nHeight obviously accounts for a good deal. It is incontestable that,\r\nin the case of a clump of trees standing in the middle of a plain,\r\nlightning will in most cases pick out the tallest. But this is not an\r\nabsolute rule. The isolation of trees, their qualities as conductors,\r\nthe degree of moisture in the soil in which they are rooted, their\r\ndistance from the storm clouds, the character of their foliage and of\r\ntheir roots--all these things are important factors.\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments have been made with a view to ascertaining the\r\namount of resistance offered to the electric spark by different kinds\r\nof wood. Similar pieces of beech and oak have been exposed lengthwise\r\nto the electric spark given out by one of Holtz's machines, with the\r\nresult that the oak wood was pierced by the electric fluid after one\r\nor two revolutions of the machine, whereas for the beech wood a dozen\r\nor twenty were needed. Black poplar wood and willow offer a moderate\r\nresistance: a few revolutions suffice to penetrate them.\r\n\r\nIn all instances the susceptibility of the wood depends on the sap. It\r\nhas been proved by analysis that the woods which contain starch with\r\nbut little oil, such as the oak, poplar, willow, maple, elm, and ash,\r\noffer much less resistance to the electric current than those trees\r\nwhich are richer in fatty matter, as the beech tree, walnut tree, lime\r\ntree, birch tree, and so on.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions are corroborated by the case of the pine tree, the\r\nwood of which has a great quantity of oil in winter, but in summer\r\nlacks it as much as those trees which contain more starch.\r\n\r\nExperiments have proved that in summer this wood is quite as likely to\r\nserve as a conductor as the oak; while in winter its resistance to the\r\nelectric spark equals that of the beech and other trees which are\r\nrarely struck by lightning. Decayed trees are excellent conductors of\r\nelectricity; those in full vigour being much more rarely struck.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it has been proved that the effects of lightning are\r\nparticularly severe in the vegetable world. It has been pointed out\r\nelsewhere in this little book to what dangers those persons are\r\nexposed who take shelter beneath the trees during a thunderstorm;\r\nthere are innumerable examples of the imprudence of taking refuge from\r\nthe rain under thick foliage, people having been killed by a\r\nfireball--for lightning does not always take the trouble to make a\r\nselection, sparing neither the protector nor the protected.\r\n\r\nWe shall give some more instances, chosen from a considerable number\r\nof similar observations.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, ten reapers, surprised by drops of rain and distant rumbling\r\nof thunder, left their work and took refuge beneath a big walnut tree.\r\nBut one of them having questioned the security of this retreat, all\r\nimmediately fled in the direction of a neighbouring wood, except one\r\nyoung girl of fourteen years. Several who returned to advise her to\r\nfollow them, saw her smilingly throw her arms round the trunk of the\r\ntree, and almost at once fall backwards, her arms extended. She was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of August in the same year, four labourers, returning from\r\nwork, were overtaken by a thunderstorm. Three of them stopped under an\r\nelm, the fourth prudently continued on his way. Well it was for him.\r\nSeveral minutes later, the lightning struck the tree, killing two of\r\nthe labourers outright, and grievously wounding the third. The latter\r\nwas found almost completely naked; his garments, burnt and tattered,\r\nwere scattered round him. When he came to himself, he was in such a\r\nviolent delirium that it was necessary for several men to bring the\r\nunfortunate victim to his home, where he died shortly afterwards in\r\nthe most horrible agony.\r\n\r\nAbout six o'clock, on the 23rd of June, seven men employed on the farm\r\nof Puy-Crouel, were working in a field of beet-root. Overcome with the\r\nheat, they went into the shade of a walnut tree. All at once, a flash\r\nof lightning illumined the sky; the seven workmen were thrown down,\r\none of them being hurled several yards away. Three of them were able\r\nto get up and go to the farm, the others were severely burnt, and half\r\nasphyxiated. One of the victims had his back skinned the whole length\r\nof the vertebral column; the other had his face scratched, as if torn\r\nby fingernails. All had lost their memory. The walnut tree under which\r\nthey had sheltered was cleft from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nHere is another example no less terrible--\r\n\r\nSeven children, belonging to Ahrens, were caught in a thunderstorm as\r\nthey were coming home from the fields, and took shelter under a tree.\r\nThe lightning killed the seven little people.\r\n\r\nAnother time, four young men taking refuge under an oak, were struck\r\nand thrown down. One of them was killed instantly, his companions were\r\ncruelly injured.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of July, in Belgium, a woman gathering cherries was killed\r\non a tree which attracted the fluid. A young man standing beneath it\r\nwas paralyzed.\r\n\r\nWe might multiply these tragic tales; each year a number of similar\r\ncases happen. The imprudence of human beings is truly incorrigible!\r\n\r\nEverybody, however feeble his instinct of self-preservation, should\r\nflee the vicinity of trees during a thunderstorm, and allow himself\r\nto be drenched on the road, rather than offer his life as a too\r\ngenerous burnt-offering to the lightning, for the oak's robust trunk,\r\nor that of the poplar, elegantly plumed with its graceful foliage, may\r\nbe the altar on which the sacrifices in honour of Jupiter are made.\r\n\r\nThe wood of trees is not so good a conductor of electricity as the\r\nhuman body. For this reason, a person leaning against a tree receives\r\nthe full discharge; at times the tree is splintered, because it did\r\nnot serve as a perfect conductor.\r\n\r\nYet the conductive power of certain species is so remarkable, that the\r\nneighbourhood of particular trees may be regarded as a protection\r\nagainst lightning (this, however, without coming in contact with\r\nthem!).\r\n\r\nThe tips of the branches pointing towards the clouds, and the moisture\r\nthey receive, undoubtedly influence the electricity of the atmosphere;\r\nand, moreover, by means of these graceful branches, an inaudible but\r\ncontinual exchange is effected between the electricity of the earth\r\nand sky, thus holding the balance between two opposite charges.\r\n\r\nColladon asserts that poplars planted near houses may, in favourable\r\nconditions, act as lightning conductors, on account of their height\r\nand powers of conducting. He adds that it is necessary to take other\r\ncircumstances regarding the situation of the dwelling into account,\r\nwhich are not always easy to define. Their protection of the\r\nneighbourhood is not constantly the same. For it to be effectual, the\r\nfoliage should be very low, and they should be at least two metres\r\ndistant from the roof and walls. Their roots, too, should be in a damp\r\nsoil, and metal should not enter largely into the construction of the\r\nneighbouring houses. In these conditions, poplars may fulfil the\r\nuseful functions of lightning conductors.\r\n\r\nAt times, during a storm, several trees are struck by the same flash.\r\nFor instance, on May 23, 1886, in Belgium, three poplars were blasted\r\nby a single thunderbolt.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, trees planted in lines are sometimes struck\r\nalternately. A case occurred where the lightning seemed to have taken\r\naim and touched all the odd numbers in a row without striking the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nCertain plantations act on the fluid with an extraordinary intensity.\r\n\r\nAt Lovenjoul, in Belgium, a wood of undergrowth and big trees, planted\r\nin marshy ground, seems to possess this singular privilege, and the\r\nagriculturists of the country declare that no storm ever passes their\r\nway without lightning falling there. In the middle of this wood one\r\ncan count seven oaks, near to one another, struck by it. Not far off,\r\na huge ash, and a little farther away two poplars, likewise blasted.\r\n\r\nAll the trees have not been struck in the same way; some are scorched\r\nor stripped of their leaves; the others have their trunks perforated,\r\nor split in different parts. Usually trees are cleft from top to\r\nbottom; in some cases the furrow is horizontal or perpendicular in the\r\ndirection of the branches.\r\n\r\nPieces of bark or of wood are sometimes torn off lengthwise, and only\r\nadhere to the trunk in strips here and there. But that does not prove\r\nconclusively that the lightning struck upwards from the ground; it may\r\nhave rebounded (?) after striking from above.\r\n\r\nCertain effects, however, can only be explained by an ascending\r\nmovement of the fluid. The following cases for example:--\r\n\r\n\"During the summer of 1787, two men were sheltering under a tree at\r\nTancon, Beaujolais, when they were struck by lightning. One of them\r\nwas killed on the spot, the other felt no ill effects other than\r\nmomentary suffocation. Their horses were caught up to the top of the\r\ntree. An iron ring which bound the wooden shoe belonging to one of the\r\nmen, was found hanging from a high branch of the same tree. Now, at a\r\nlittle distance, there was a tree which had also suffered greatly by\r\nthe passage of the electric fluid. In the soil at its base a round\r\nhole was to be seen, shaped like a funnel. Directly above it the bark\r\nhad been loosened and slit into slender thongs. As for the tree\r\nbeneath which the men had sheltered, it also had half its bark off,\r\nand long splinters were to be seen hanging only by the upper parts. On\r\none side of the tree the leaves were withered, on the other they were\r\nstill quite green.\"\r\n\r\nIn this most remarkable instance the lightning had come out of the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn the cleft of a willow tree blasted by lightning its roots were\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nBesides, the soil is often undulating, and thrown up around trees\r\nwhich have been struck.\r\n\r\nVegetables do not always succumb, any more than men, to these attacks.\r\nThey may be lightly struck in a vital part, in which case they recover\r\nfrom their wounds. Very often they are merely stripped of their\r\nnatural garments, in other words, of their bark and foliage. This is\r\none of those superficial injuries to which they are most subject.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of this kind of fulguration:--\r\n\r\nOn July 16, 1708, two oaks were struck at Brampton. The larger\r\nmeasured about ten feet around the base. They were both split asunder,\r\nand the bark peeled off from the summit to the soil, a length of\r\ntwenty-eight feet. Completely detached from the trunk, it hung in long\r\nstrips from the top.\r\n\r\nBoussingault witnessed the destruction by lightning of a wild pear\r\ntree at Lamperlasch, near Beekelleronn. At the moment of the explosion\r\nan enormous column of vapour arose, like smoke coming out of a chimney\r\nwhen fresh coal has been put on the fire. The lightning flashed in all\r\ndirections, great branches gave way, and when the vapour cleared off,\r\nthere stood the pear tree, its trunk a dazzling white: the lightning\r\nhad taken the bark completely off. Sometimes the bark is only\r\npartially stripped off one side, or left on, in more or less regular\r\nbands, either on the trunk or on the branches.\r\n\r\nDuring a violent storm at Juvisy, on May 18, 1897, an elm five hundred\r\nmetres distant from the Observatory was struck by lightning, which\r\ntook the bark off lengthwise in a strip, four centimetres wide and\r\nfive centimetres deep. This band of bark was cut clean off. There was\r\nno trace of burning.\r\n\r\nSometimes only the mosses and lichens are whisked off the sides of the\r\ntrees, which escape with light scratches. Two great oaks which had\r\nbeen struck by fireballs, only bore traces of two punctures which\r\nmight have been made by small shot.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is not uncommon to see the bark riddled with a multitude\r\nof little holes, like those made by worms.\r\n\r\nTwo men were struck by lightning near Casal Maggiore on August 15,\r\n1791, beneath an elm tree. One of them had his elbow on the tree at\r\nthe moment, and amongst other injuries were a number of little holes\r\nin the arm. There was a twist in the tree at the part where the elbow\r\nrested, and a hole penetrated the centre of it to the core of the\r\nwood. The surrounding bark looked as if it had been mite-eaten.\r\nSeveral scars started from this point and ascended almost\r\nperpendicularly towards the top of the trunk. There was no damage done\r\nto the branches.\r\n\r\nLightning cut through a chestnut tree, five metres high, on the\r\nroadside at Foulain (Haute-Marne), burning several leaves, then struck\r\nsome water-pipes at a depth of a metre and a half, and finally passed\r\ninto the dike through two holes a metre deep by a decimetre in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe bark is often reduced to thin splinters scattered on the soil, or\r\nhanging from the neighbouring trees, or even thrown to a considerable\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nOn June 25, a fireball fell near Jare (Landes) on a pine tree, which\r\nit shivered into a myriad slender strips, about 2 metres long, many of\r\nwhich were caught on the branches of pines within a distance of 15\r\nmetres. Only a stump, 2-1/2 metres in height, remained standing. At\r\nthe same time three other pines, which stood 18 and 25 metres away\r\nfrom the first, were destroyed. The bark had been stripped off each,\r\nbut only as far as the incision made for extracting the resin.\r\n\r\nFurrows, of varying width, and running in different directions, may at\r\ntimes be seen on trees, some short, others reaching to the top of the\r\ntree, and occasionally to the roots. These marks show the passing of\r\nthe lightning.\r\n\r\nSir John Clark has seen a huge oak in Cumberland, at least 60 feet\r\nhigh and 4 feet in diameter, from which the lightning had stripped a\r\npiece of bark, about 10 centimetres wide and 5 centimetres thick, the\r\nwhole length of the trunk in a straight line.\r\n\r\nThe furrow is not always single, it may be double, and either stretch\r\nin two parallel lines or diverge.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier de Louville observed in the park of the castle at\r\nNevers, a tree struck at the top of the trunk by lightning which,\r\ndividing in three shafts, hollowed three furrows that might have been\r\nmade by three rifle shots fired towards the roots. These three furrows\r\nfollowed the irregularities of the trunk, always slipping, gliding\r\nbetween the wood and the bark, and curiously enough the former was not\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\nBut these bands are not invariably straight either; in the above\r\nexample they followed the caprices of the vegetable body. They are to\r\nbe found oblique in certain cases, but more often they surround the\r\ntrunk in long spirals of varying width, showing that the lightning\r\nclasped the tree in the form of a serpent of fire.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:--\r\n\r\nDuring a violent storm on July 17, 1895, a poplar was blasted on the\r\nroad through the forest of Moladier, 160 metres north-west of the\r\ncastle of Valliere. The tree was 25 metres high, and in full leaf from\r\nbase to summit; it was struck halfway up by the discharge, and a\r\nspiral furrow 10 centimetres wide twisted round the trunk to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nI noted a similar case, August 25, 1901.\r\n\r\nLightning struck one of the highest trees in the park at Juvisy, a\r\nmagnificent ash, stripping off and destroying the bark where the\r\nelectric fluid curved round and round down the full length of the\r\ntrunk, which was shattered by the meteor a few metres above the roots.\r\nEnormous fragments lay all round the trunk, some hurled to such a\r\ndistance that it was obvious the explosive force of the phenomenon\r\nmust have been of extraordinary violence.\r\n\r\nI was able to trace the course of the lightning to the foot of the\r\ntree, along its roots to a great depth, by a black furrow.\r\n\r\nThe tree is not dead. The ivy which clung to it is dead.\r\n\r\nThe vast and splendid forest of Saint Germain often witnesses the\r\npresence of the lightning, and the magnificent trees which adorn and\r\nbeautify this charming and celebrated place are, unfortunately, too\r\noften the victims of these inopportune visitations.\r\n\r\nLightning has no respect for old memories. It demolished with a single\r\nflash a superb giant whose long branches, laden with perfumed leaves,\r\nhad given shade to many generations. The splendid tree, which had\r\nsurvived the severity of several centuries, fell beneath the arrow of\r\nthe pernicious fluid. Such was the fate of an oak near l'Etoile du\r\nGrand-Veneur. Struck on the top, its upper branches were violently\r\ntorn off.... A spiral furrow beginning at the top ended within a metre\r\nof the ground. But, wonderful to relate, the whole mass of the tree\r\nappeared to have been twisted mightily by a force which worked with so\r\nmuch power that the tree could never regain its original position. The\r\nfibre, instead of growing vertically, followed the furrow made by the\r\nlightning, and became twisted like a corkscrew. There exist certain\r\nsingular trees, the fibre of which grows in spiral fashion, and is\r\ncalled twisted wood by carpenters and cabinet-makers. Pines and firs\r\nin mountainous countries are fairly often affected in this curious\r\nfashion. One can no more account for it than one can define the cause\r\nof the curved form of some flashes of lightning. One does not know\r\nexactly if they should be attributed to their following the direction\r\ntaken by the fibre, or whether, on the contrary, the tree had been\r\nstruck in its infancy by a spiral flash, and, submitting to that\r\ninfluence, continued to grow up corkscrew fashion.\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that the fall of the thunder-ball on the trees in\r\nthis manner is governed by the laws of electricity. We may even note\r\ncasually that traces of similar spirals have been remarked on objects\r\nas well as on the dead bodies of those struck by lightning, thus\r\npreserving the ceraunic likeness of the mortal blow.\r\n\r\nOther observers, besides, have declared that they saw distinctly the\r\nspiral lightning flash through the atmosphere. But these observations\r\nwould need to be confirmed by photographs of indisputable accuracy. In\r\nthese circumstances, as in many others, the dark room is worth a\r\nhundred human eyes!\r\n\r\nIn some cases the curved furrow turns several times. For instance, in\r\nMay, 1850, Grebel saw an alder nearly twenty metres high struck by\r\nlightning on the right bank of the Elster below Zeitz. On the lower\r\npart of its trunk were two spiral bands which had carried away bark\r\nand sap-wood, leaving no trace of combustion.\r\n\r\nThe depth and width of the twist are very variable; at times the\r\nfurrow is deeper in the veined parts than at the edges; again it\r\nreaches the core.\r\n\r\nTwo oaks were struck in June, 1742, in the park at Thornden. One was\r\nmarked with a spiral for a length of forty feet to within a little\r\ndistance of the ground. The band was five inches wide, but became\r\nnarrower as it descended, and was finally no more than two inches\r\nwide. The wood was incised and even torn in places, but the branches\r\nwere not hurt. The rest of the bark seemed to have been riddled by\r\nsmall shot.\r\n\r\nAll the injuries of which we have spoken (excoriation, stripping off\r\nthe bark, furrows), are not necessarily mortal. But there are other\r\nmore serious wounds from which the tree rarely recovers. We allude to\r\ndeep fissures and breaks produced by lightning. When the fracture\r\ntouches only a portion of the topmost part of the tree, the result of\r\nthe accident is not necessarily fatal. But this is not always so.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 1865, a poplar was split in two by lightning at\r\nMontigny-sur-Loing. One half to the full height continued standing.\r\nThe other half was chopped up in small fragments and thrown to a\r\ndistance of a hundred metres. These pieces, which were brought to me\r\nby M. Fouché, are so dried up and fibrous that they might be taken for\r\nhemp instead of wood.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of these cases the tree is split from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 1884, in Belgium, a poplar, the biggest of a group of trees\r\nof the same species, was struck and split down its full length.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1853, on the side of the road from\r\nVille-d'Avray to Versailles, a poplar of about twenty years old was\r\ncleft from the topmost bough to its roots; one half remained in its\r\nplace, the other fell on the road. A black line, about a millimetre\r\nwide, ran down the centre of the tree.\r\n\r\nSometimes the tree is divided into several parts by vertical fissures.\r\nFor example, in 1827, near Vicence, a pear tree, three feet in\r\ndiameter, was split into four parts, from the top down.\r\n\r\nHow often one has remarked great tree trunks in the forests, decayed\r\nand desolate, standing sadly, like poor headless bodies? Very often\r\nlightning has been the executioner of these trees.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, 1867, in the forest of Fontainebleau, a\r\nmagnificent oak, about two metres in circumference, was completely\r\ndecapitated by lightning; its branches fell on the ground. The part of\r\nthe trunk left standing was barked to the roots and splintered into\r\nfragments of varying sizes. They were scattered on the ground or hung\r\nfrom the branches of the surrounding trees. Several pieces of\r\nconsiderable size were hurled more than thirty metres away, much to\r\nthe injury of the bark of the trees which they struck.\r\n\r\nIn numerous cases, the tree struck by lightning is broken in several\r\nplaces, and fragments of it thrown far and wide.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 1871, at the farm of Etiefs, near Rouvres, canton of\r\nAuberive (Haute-Marne), lightning struck an Italian poplar, sixty\r\nyears old, thirty metres high, and three metres round at a height of\r\none metre from the ground, splintering off enough wood to make a heap\r\nsixty-five centimetres round, and fifty centimetres high.\r\n\r\nAn ash was struck by lightning on July 17, 1895, on the road to\r\nClermont. This tree, ten metres high, was broken at a point 3-1/5\r\nmetres from the ground, and the crown, still hanging by a shred from\r\nthe trunk, lay on the embankment. The violence of the explosion threw\r\npieces thirty centimetres wide and 3-1/2 metres in length, into a\r\nfield from twenty-five to thirty metres off.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1884, in Belgium, a willow was reduced to a heap of atoms\r\non the ground. In March, 1818, at Plymouth, a fir more than a hundred\r\nfeet high and forty feet in circumference, the admiration of the\r\ncountryside, disappeared, literally shattered into bits. Some\r\nfragments were thrown two hundred and fifty metres away.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious effects of lightning is to divide the interior\r\nof the tree into concentric layers, fitting them perfectly one into\r\nthe other, but at the same time separating them with extraordinary\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\n_Arbres roulés_ (thus are the trees called which are victims of this\r\nodd phenomenon), as a rule, do not show any injury on the outside. But\r\nthe body, dissected by the electric fluid, soon succumbs.\r\n\r\nAn oak, twenty-five metres high, having been struck on August 25,\r\n1818, was opened to be examined carefully, and it was stated that the\r\nconcentric layers were as detached from one another as the tubes of an\r\nopera-glass.\r\n\r\nThe fireball sometimes hollows a canal through the centre of the trees\r\nfrom the top to the bottom, the sides of which are burnt black. The\r\nfollowing is a curious example:--\r\n\r\nIn June, 1823, at Moisselles, lightning fell upon a great elm, and\r\nstriking against an enormous knob, rebounded on to a neighbouring elm\r\nhalf its own height, pierced it through and through, shivering it to\r\ntatters; the trunk was burst open to the roots, it looked as if it had\r\nbeen bored through from one end to the other by a red-hot bullet that\r\nblackened and charred it.\r\n\r\nDoes it not seem as if the lightning plays with the lives of the trees\r\nas with man? It threatens, changes, apparently spares, returns to the\r\ncharge and finally annihilates. And this sport is accompanied, at\r\ntimes, by inconceivable effects.\r\n\r\nBut records are still more eloquent than reflections: Nature, in her\r\nown mute speech, tells us of a thousand marvels.\r\n\r\nIs not the following phenomenon enough to make lightning more\r\nmysterious in its fantastic and varied mode of action?\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of April, lightning struck an oak in the forest of Vibraye\r\n(Sarthe), cut this tree, measuring a metre and a half in\r\ncircumference, at two-thirds of its height, pulverized the lower\r\nparts, strewed the shreds over a circuit of fifty metres, and planted\r\nthe upper part exactly on the spot from which the trunk had been\r\nsnatched, with all the rapidity of a flash.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the annual concentric circles were separated by the sudden\r\ndrying up of the sap so effectually, that, the strips only remained\r\nwelded together where the knots made too great an obstacle to their\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nHow was the lightning able to plant in the earth, with such\r\ninconceivable rapidity, the top of the tree where the roots had been?\r\nThis is something which no one can explain. It alone is capable of\r\ncreating such situations.\r\n\r\nBut it has done better still! Two years later, in 1868, it took the\r\nopportunity of playing a good trick on two trees of different species,\r\nan English oak and a forest pine, which, without race jealousy,\r\nfraternized in the forest of Pont-de-Bussière (Haute-Vienne). These\r\ntwo trees were about ten yards apart, and were simultaneously hit by\r\nthe explosive matter, and in the twinkling of an eye, their leaves\r\nwere changed. The pine needles found themselves on the oak, and the\r\nleaves of the oak went to brighten the austerity of the pine with\r\ntheir delicate verdure. There was nothing commonplace about the\r\nmetamorphosis. Accordingly all the inhabitants went in crowds to the\r\nscene of this miracle to contemplate the unusual spectacle of a\r\npine-oak and an oak-pine.\r\n\r\nAnd the unexpected happened: both trees appeared to thrive very well\r\nin these new conditions: the pine continued to be agreeably adorned\r\nwith its festival foliage, whilst the oak agreed perfectly with the\r\nsombre needles of the pine.\r\n\r\nAfter such marvels, my readers will not be surprised to learn that\r\nlightning sometimes shatters the living wood, or decayed wood, into a\r\nthousand morsels without setting it on fire.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a bundle of faggots lying on the hearth has been reduced\r\nto atoms by lightning, without any trace of combustion being visible.\r\n\r\nA fireball fell on a sheaf of barley in the open field without setting\r\nit on fire, and buried itself in the ground without doing other\r\nfurther damage.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases the electric fluid chars wood at varying depths: the\r\nblackened layer is often very slight; sometimes, on the contrary,\r\ncombustion is complete.\r\n\r\nAs for the leaves, they are unhurt as a rule. When they are attacked\r\nthey shrivel up; an autumnal shade takes the place of their charming\r\ngreen tints; they turn brown and dry up quickly.\r\n\r\nOne of the trees in the Champs-Élysées having been struck, it was\r\nproved that all round it the ground was full of little holes. In two\r\nor three places the bark was raised from beneath; the leaves were\r\nyellow and shrivelled up as parchment would be by the fire; the upper\r\npart remained green. Everything seemed to prove that the lightning\r\ncame out of the ground.\r\n\r\nAt other times the same effect may be observed on the leaves, when the\r\ntrunk and roots are apparently uninjured. It is not unusual to see the\r\ntree instantly stripped of its leaves as if by some mysterious power.\r\n\r\nThe lightning acts also on the roots, as we have seen in the preceding\r\nexamples. They have been seen uncovered where the ground was much\r\ndisturbed, torn in strips, or cleft in more or less regular pieces.\r\n\r\nWe see that lightning does not make more ado about exhaling its\r\nbaleful breath on the life of plants, than on animals and men. And\r\nmoreover, that it often strikes these latter with sudden death without\r\nleaving a trace of its passing, just as sometimes it strikes the trees\r\nwithout leaving any exterior injury. Now and then life is not\r\ncompletely extinguished, and little by little the tree recovers its\r\nhealth. Often the vitality is not changed, one sees the tree which was\r\nstruck bear fruit as before the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nHas it not been asserted that lightning may exert a benign influence\r\non vegetation?\r\n\r\nThis was the opinion of the ancients.\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of this, Pliny said, \"That thunder is rarely heard in\r\nwinter, and that the great fertility of the soil is due to the\r\nfrequency of thunder and rain in spring; for the countries where it\r\nrains often and in good earnest during the spring, as in the island of\r\nSicily, produce many and excellent fruits.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been proved in our times that the ancients were right in\r\nextolling rainwater as nourishment for the products of the earth, and\r\nscience has discovered the cause to be the presence of great\r\nquantities of nitrogen and ammonia in the thunder-rain and in hail.\r\nPerhaps electricity has a similar effect.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Castres, on April 13, 1781, an old poplar was\r\nstripped of its bark in several places. Now, shortly afterwards it\r\nburst into leaf, although the neighbouring poplars were much later\r\nthan it.\r\n\r\nThe ravages caused in the fields by the electric meteor to forage and\r\nvegetables are sometimes considerable. This is especially so with\r\ngrass when cut, to haycocks, ricks of straw, barley, etc. We have a\r\ncollection of records of men or animals who, when leaning against\r\nhaystacks, were struck.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the haystack is burnt; sometimes, however, the grass is\r\nsimply scattered and thrown to a distance.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, a very curious occurrence was observed at Vayres\r\n(Haute-Vienne).\r\n\r\nThe lightning struck a field of potatoes at the village of\r\nPuytreuillard; some of the stalks were burnt to cinders; but most\r\nremarkable of all, _the potatoes were done to a turn_, just as if they\r\nhad been cooked beneath hot ashes.\r\n\r\nA belief which was very general in ancient times and derived without\r\ndoubt from a recollection of the circumstances which were said to\r\naccompany the birth of Bacchus, gave the vine the privilege of\r\nprotecting the neighbourhood from the fatal effects of lightning. But\r\nthis again is only a legend. The following observation proves it:--\r\n\r\nOn July 10, 1884, at Chanvres (Yonne), fifty vine-stocks were frizzled\r\nup by lightning.\r\n\r\nIt used to be supposed, too, that the electric fluid held the lily in\r\nparticular respect. But here is a note which shows us that the white\r\nflower is visited by the burning flashes. During a violent\r\nthunderstorm on June 25, 1881, at Montmorin (Haute-Garonne)----But let\r\nM. Larroque, who witnessed the curious phenomenon, describe it: \"In a\r\nclump of lilies in my garden,\" says he, \"I see the highest of them\r\nsurrounded by a violet glimmer, which formed an aureola round the\r\ncorolla. This glimmer lasted for eight or ten seconds. As soon as it\r\ndisappeared, I went close to the lily, which, to my great surprise, I\r\nfound had been deprived of its pollen, while the surrounding flowers\r\nwere laden with it. So the electric fluid must have scattered or\r\ncarried off the pollen.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Jupiter thunders, he still seems to dominate our world, as in the\r\ndays when the graceful legends of mythology flourished.\r\n\r\nAnd not only does he work above ground, but, contrary to the belief of\r\nthe ancients, his influence extends beneath the soil.\r\n\r\nA great number of men were working in the mines at Himmelsfurth on\r\nJuly 5, 1755. They were, as often happens, working at various points\r\nalong the vein of metal, and never dreaming of the events which might\r\ntake place on the surface of the ground. All at once they were\r\nconscious of several very violent shocks, given in the oddest and most\r\nextravagant fashion. Some felt the shock in their backs, while their\r\nneighbours received them on their arms or legs. They might have been\r\nshaken by a mysterious invisible hand, stretching now up from below,\r\nnow from above, now from the sides of the galleries. One of the\r\nminers found himself hurled against the wall, two others, whose backs\r\nwere turned, almost came to blows, each believing that his mate had\r\nthumped him.\r\n\r\nThe real culprit was the thunder, of whom they might well demand an\r\nexplanation of these strange proceedings.\r\n\r\nHere is another example which bears out the foregoing:--\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of May, the watchman on guard at the pit mouth of one of\r\nthe principal mines at Freyberg, perceived an electric glimmer run\r\nalong the wire rope going to the bottom of the mines, and used by the\r\nminers to exchange signals with the men employed in working the lifts.\r\nSuddenly all the pits were brilliantly lit up. At the same moment the\r\nwatchman saw a clear vivid flame shoot out at the other end of the\r\nchain. On this occasion the lightning behaved with due discretion, and\r\nshone through the mine without giving any one the slightest shock.\r\n\r\nIn vain the monster Tiberius, and the infamous Caligula, sought a\r\nsubterranean refuge from lightning. Their impure consciences, laden\r\nwith crimes, dreaded the chastisement of heaven. By fleeing from the\r\nlightning flash, they believed themselves saved from death. Lightning\r\ndogs our footsteps, and works even when the criminals believe\r\nthemselves in safety. It is conceivable that the ancients should have\r\ndreaded it as an instrument of celestial justice.\r\n\r\nUsually lightning strikes the ground with a vertical stroke, but at\r\ntimes obliquely, when it traces long, horizontal lines. Often the\r\nground may be seen turned up at the foot of trees which have been\r\nstruck, the sod is torn, and stones thrown to a great distance.\r\nSometimes, too, an excavation may be seen in the ground near the\r\nobject struck, of varying breadth and height. This opening may be like\r\na funnel or hemispherical.\r\n\r\nIn a case observed on June 6, 1883, at Côte (Haute-Saône), a circular\r\nhole, having a depth of 1·20 metres, has been seen in a dyke on the\r\ndeclivity of the road, below a coach which was not struck.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the hole is but the beginning of a canal, hollowed rather\r\ndeeply and perpendicularly in the ground, the sides of which serve as\r\na sheath to the fulgurite. But before treating of fulgurite tubes,\r\nwhich constitute the most curious phenomena in the world connected\r\nwith lightning, we shall discuss certain remarkable effects observed\r\non the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nFalling on solid rocks, the electric spark can break them, cut them,\r\nor pierce them in one or more places. Often instead of spoiling or\r\ncutting off pieces of the stone, it covers the surface instantaneously\r\nwith a vitreous coat, having blisters of various colours. This\r\nvitrification is often to be seen on mountains.\r\n\r\nDe Saussure found rocks of schistous amphiboles covered with vitreous\r\nbubbles, like those seen on tiles where struck by lightning. Humboldt\r\nmade similar observations on porphyritic rocks at Névada de Toluca, in\r\nMexico, and Ramond, at the Sanadoire rock in Puy-de-Dôme.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the spark, on reaching the surface, melts it more or\r\nless completely over a varying extent, and this fusion, worked upon by\r\nan extraordinary heat, produces a coat having a peculiar appearance,\r\nbut in which microscopical analysis finds the elements of the body it\r\ncovers.\r\n\r\nThus the vitreous layer deposited over chalk is of chalky origin; that\r\ncovering granite is of the nature of granite, etc.\r\n\r\nThis does not apply to certain deposits found on rocks, and even on\r\ntrees, which have been struck by lightning, and which are of very\r\ndifferent origin.\r\n\r\nWhilst the former is only the stone in a fused or vitrified condition,\r\nthe latter is caused by the presence of foreign bodies, some fragments\r\nof which have been detached by the ray and travel with it. This\r\ntransport of solid substances by lightning has often been observed.\r\nHere are two examples of this strange phenomenon:--\r\n\r\nOn July 28, 1885, at Luchon, on the Bigorre road a passer-by saw\r\nlightning fall twenty yards away from him. Recovered from the shock,\r\nhe went out of curiosity to look at the result, and saw the wall at\r\nthe edge of the road, the schistous and chalky rocks, even the trees\r\nthemselves, coated over with layers of brown. It was certainly a case\r\nof the lightning having effected a deposit. This latter was very\r\ncurious. Lines could be traced on it with the finger-nail, it fell to\r\npowder under slight pressure, became soft with gentle rubbing, caught\r\nfire from a candle, and then gave off a resinous odour with much\r\nsmoke. What is this resinous matter? That is what no one yet can say.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, 1885, on the day following a violent\r\nthunderstorm which had struck the telegraph-office in the station of\r\nSavigny-sur-Orge, I myself picked up a little black powder off the\r\ntelegraph poles, which had been left by the lightning, and which had a\r\nsulphurous smell.\r\n\r\nThe production of this ponderable matter has often been attributed to\r\nbolides, but direct observation proves beyond a doubt that the\r\nelectricity carries various solid substances found on earth after a\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nLightning is truly the most venerable of glass-makers. Long before the\r\nmost remote peoples of antiquity appeared, whose glasswares encrusted\r\nwith marvellous iridescent tones by the passing of the centuries, are\r\nunearthed by scientific excavations, and displayed in national\r\ncollections; long before man could have learnt to make use of the\r\nresources of nature, lightning, burrowing in the sand, there fashioned\r\ntubes of glass that hold the hues of the opal, and are called\r\nfulgurites.\r\n\r\nThe ancients seem to have known of these fulgurite tubes, but we owe\r\nthe first precise description and the first specimen of these\r\nextraordinary vitrifactions to Hermann, a pastor at Massel in Silesia.\r\nHis fulgurite, found in 1711, is in the Dresden Museum.\r\n\r\nSince this discovery, fulgurites have often been sought for and found.\r\nThe tubes, contracted at one end, and ending in a point, are to be\r\nseen in sandy soils.\r\n\r\nTheir diameter varies from 1 to 90 millimetres, and the thickness of\r\ntheir sides from half to 24 millimetres. As to the length, it\r\nsometimes exceeds 6 metres. Vitrified inside, they are covered outside\r\nwith grains of sand agglutinated and apparently rounded as if they had\r\nbeen subjected to a beginning of fusion. The colour depends on the\r\nnature of the sand in which they have been formed. Where the sand is\r\nferruginous the fulgurite takes a yellowish hue, but if the sand is\r\nvery clean, it is almost colourless or even white. As a rule, the\r\nfulgurites penetrate the ground vertically, Nevertheless, they have\r\nbeen found in an oblique position. At times, also, they are sinuous,\r\ntwisted, or even zigzag if they have met with pebbles of considerable\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for the fulgurite tube to divide in two or three\r\nbranches, each of which gives birth to little lateral branches of 2 or\r\n3 centimetres long, and ending in points.\r\n\r\nThere are also solid fulgurites and foliated fulgurites. The former,\r\nno doubt, had a canal originally, which has been stopped up by matter\r\nin fusion. The latter, instead of being stretched out in cylindrical\r\nform, are composed of slender layers like the leaves of a book.\r\n\r\nThe scientific museum at the Observatory of Juvisy possesses a very\r\ncurious fulgurite which was offered to me some years ago by M. Bernard\r\nd'Attanoux, and found by him in Sahara. It is not a tube ending in a\r\npoint. The lightning penetrating the sand, vitrified it on its\r\npassage, and branched irregularly in three principal directions. One\r\nmight say it was slag formed by the juxtaposition, irregular and\r\ncrumpled, of three blades of vitrified sand, which would be pressed\r\ntogether by leaving a narrow opening to their central vertical axis.\r\nThis fulgurite, which is extremely light, measures six centimetres in\r\nlength. It was found in the sand of Grand-Erg, at a depth of several\r\ncentimetres. It has been found possible to produce miniature\r\nfulgurites by means of our electrical machines. By adding ordinary\r\nsalt to the sand, and directing a strong current into it, complete\r\nvitrification of a tube of several millimetres is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF LIGHTNING ON METALS, OBJECTS, HOUSES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen lightning strikes the earth, it makes straight for metals. Their\r\nperfect conducting powers place them in the first rank of conductors,\r\nand the innumerable cases of lightning with which they are associated\r\nhave gained them a certain celebrity in the annals of thunder.\r\n\r\nWe know, indeed, the preference of the spark for metals; we know it\r\nnurses a veritable passion for nails, wire, bell-pulls, that it dotes\r\non rain-spouts, leaden pipes, and telegraph wires, that it is very\r\nfeminine in its adoration of jewels, which it sublimates sometimes\r\nwith a truly fantastic dexterity.\r\n\r\nNow and then lightning deviates from its path, and performs acrobatic\r\nfeats, elfin capers to reach the objects it covets. On April 24, 1842,\r\nit struck the church of Brexton, springing on the cross of the steeple\r\nat first and running down the stem, but, arrived at the masonry which\r\nsupported it, broke it into pieces; then with one bound it fell upon\r\na second conductor, whose support was also broken. Finally, it struck\r\na third conductor much lower down.\r\n\r\nThe fluid often searches for metals hidden beneath non-conductors,\r\nwhich it breaks or pierces. It avoids the mattress to pursue the iron\r\nof the bed, glances off the windows to glide over the curtain-rods, or\r\nthe lead of the sash. It has been seen to penetrate thick walls to\r\nreach the iron safes hidden behind them.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the case of the woman who, without having\r\nbeen killed, had her ear-ring split. Well, we have a certain number of\r\nsimilar examples to that.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1809, in a boarding-school for young ladies, at Bordeaux, a\r\ngold chain, worn by one of the young ladies, was melted by the\r\nlightning, which left a black indented line in its place, which,\r\nhowever, soon passed off. The lady was struck, but recovered\r\nconsciousness within a few hours, being none the worse. Her slender\r\nchain, worn in three rows round her neck, had been cut into five\r\npieces. Some of the fragments showed signs of fusion, and had been\r\ncarried to a distance.\r\n\r\nOther examples, in which the consequences were more dramatic, will\r\nshow ladies the dangers of a love of adornment.\r\n\r\nOn September 21, 1901, during a violent thunderstorm which burst over\r\nthe region of Narbonne, a fireball fell in the domain of Castelou. A\r\nyoung girl of fourteen was fatally struck by the meteor. The gold\r\nchain which she wore round her throat was completely evaporated. There\r\nwas not a trace of it to be found.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual to see gold chains broken, melted, partially or\r\ncompletely, in the pocket which had held them.\r\n\r\nThus, lightning melted a watch and chain into a single lump in the\r\npocket of a man killed on board a passenger boat.\r\n\r\nBracelets, hairpins, and even precious stones are sometimes very\r\nstrangely altered.\r\n\r\nAs for watches, without speaking of the magnetization observed after a\r\nviolent electrical discharge, it has been remarked that the movement\r\nbecame slower. In some cases they stopped short, and marked the exact\r\ninstant when the lightning stopped them.\r\n\r\nWhen the ship _Eagle_ was struck by lightning, none of the passengers\r\nwere injured, but all their watches stopped at the moment the shock\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nAt other times there are peculiarities in the works which are\r\nabsolutely inexplicable. The following observation, related by Biot,\r\nis a curious case in point.\r\n\r\nA young man was slightly struck by lightning in the street of\r\nGrenelle-Saint-Germain. His watch was in no wise hurt outside, but,\r\nalthough it was only a quarter-past eleven, the hands pointed to a\r\nquarter to five.\r\n\r\nConvinced that it was in need of repair, the young man placed it on\r\nhis table, intending to take it to the watchmaker; but next day,\r\nthinking he would wind it up to make sure of the extent of the damage,\r\nhe saw, to his amazement, the hands moved and kept regular time.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the case of the watch is seriously injured, while\r\nthe works are none the worse.\r\n\r\nA man wore a watch with a double cap attached to a gold chain. The\r\nchain was broken, some of the links soldered together. The cap had\r\nbeen perforated, and the gold spilt in his pocket. The watch itself\r\nhad not been altered.\r\n\r\nBut if lightning sometimes stops the works of watches, it also\r\nproduces the contrary effect.\r\n\r\nBeyer relates that a flash of lightning, having entered a room and\r\nbroken the corner of a glass, set a watch going which had been stopped\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\nI find the following note amongst my papers: \"M. Coulvier-Gravier,\r\ndirector of the meteoric observatory of the palace of Luxembourg, told\r\nme yesterday that on Sunday, April 8, at 9.35 in the evening, a watch\r\n(wound up), which had stopped a week previously, went on at the moment\r\nlightning struck the lightning conductor on the Luxembourg above\r\nthese rooms.\"\r\n\r\nOften enough the case is badly injured: the polish is rubbed off the\r\nmetal, it is melted, bored through, and even dented, without any trace\r\nof fusion.\r\n\r\nA case of the latter is rare. Here is an example, however.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, 1853, a man from Aigremont having been killed by\r\nlightning, his silver watch was found in his watch-pocket completely\r\nsmashed.\r\n\r\nIndeed, one of the most common effects of lightning on watches is the\r\nmagnetization to which the various pieces of steel are subjected. We\r\nhave a considerable number of records concerning these magnetic\r\nproperties. In one case the balance had its poles so well pointed\r\nthat, when placed on a raft, it served as a compass.\r\n\r\nWe may observe, by the way, that clocks and chronometers are sometimes\r\nas much injured also by the spark. It often gives an energetic twist\r\nto the needles, or to the spring for regulating the strokes, or it\r\neven melts the wheel-works, either partially or completely.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to form any idea of the various operations of\r\nlightning; here it hurls itself down like a fiery torrent, there it\r\nmakes itself so tiny that it can pass through the smallest apertures.\r\n\r\nDoes it not even slip under women's corsets, melting the busks and the\r\nlittle knobs which serve to hook them.\r\n\r\nIt even attacks the various metal articles which set off our garments,\r\neven to the shoe-buckles, buttons, etc.\r\n\r\nKeys are, as a rule, very ill-treated by the fire of heaven: they are\r\ntwisted, flattened, melted or soldered to the ring from which they\r\nhang.\r\n\r\nOn May 12, 1890, a man living at Troyes returned to his house while a\r\nviolent storm was raging. The moment he put his key into the lock, the\r\nwhite gleam of a dazzling flash of lightning surrounded him, the ring\r\nholding his keys was broken in his hand, and they were scattered on\r\nthe threshold.\r\n\r\nAt times, too, scissors, needles, etc., are snatched out of the hands\r\nof the workers, and carried some distance off when they are not\r\nreduced to vapour.\r\n\r\nAt Saint-Dizier (Haute-Marne) in July, 1886, lightning fell on the\r\nworkshop of M. Penon, a chain-maker. Five or six workmen were\r\nfinishing their work or getting ready to leave.\r\n\r\nEntering by the window near which M. Penon--who was absent at the\r\ntime--usually worked, the fluid grazed the bellows which were\r\nopposite, and caught up a piece of it, which one would have thought\r\nwas cut off with a knife. Turning to the left, and passing behind a\r\nchain-maker, who felt a violent shock, it passed to a heap of chains\r\nwhich it did not damage much. All the links in a chain of about a\r\nmetre long were, however, soldered together; the whole chain seemed\r\nto be galvanized, and the soldering was not easily broken by hand.\r\nPieces of iron which had been cut and prepared for the manufacture,\r\nwere found twisted and soldered together in the same way. Finally the\r\nlightning snatched the iron hoops from a tub, and, returning the same\r\nway, broke a piece of wood from a board, so as to go through the lower\r\npart of a partition, the masonry of which was carried away for a\r\nlength of fifty centimetres.\r\n\r\nVery often lightning rivals the most skilful cabinet-makers: iron or\r\ncopper nails are pulled out of a piece of furniture with a most\r\namazing skill, without doing any harm to the material they kept in\r\nplace. Ordinarily they are thrown far away. Here are two examples of\r\nthis curious phenomenon:--\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 1824, lightning penetrated a house at Campbeltown;\r\nthe copper nails in the chairs were pulled out very precisely, without\r\nthe stuff being spoiled. Some were conveyed to the corner of a box\r\nstanding at the opposite end of the room, others were so solidly fixed\r\nin the partitions, that it was only with great difficulty that they\r\nwere pulled out (Howar). At another time, close to Marseilles,\r\nlightning slipped into a drawing-room, one might say, like a robber,\r\none evening, and pilfered all the nails out of a couch covered with\r\nsatin. Then it departed by the chimney through which it had entered.\r\nAs for the nails, they were found, two years afterwards, under a tile!\r\n\r\nLocks, screws, door-knobs are frequently pulled out by the fluid.\r\n\r\nSometimes metal objects of much larger size, such as forks or\r\nagricultural instruments, share the same fate. Violently torn out of\r\nthe hands of their owners, they start upon an aerial voyage, borne on\r\nthe incandescent wings of the wrathful lightning.\r\n\r\nWorkers in the fields have often been warned of the dangers to which\r\nthey expose themselves beneath a thundery sky, by carrying their\r\nimplements with the point in the air. Each year the same accidents\r\noccur in precisely similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe electric fluid, invited by the metal point which acts like a\r\nlittle lightning conductor, darts from the clouds upon this centre of\r\nattraction, and runs into the ordinary reservoir by the intermedial\r\nbody of the man, who plays the _rôle_ of conductor.\r\n\r\nTwo labourers were spreading manure in a field, when a storm came on.\r\nIt was at the beginning of May, 1901. Obliged to give up work, they\r\nwere thinking of returning home. Each carried an American fork over\r\nhis shoulder. They had come within 150 metres of the village, when a\r\nformidable burst of flame took place over their heads. Instantly the\r\ntwo labourers fell, never to rise again.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 I made notes of several cases of this kind, from which I shall\r\nquote the two following:--\r\n\r\nOn June 2, a labourer from the hamlet of Pair, commune of Taintrux\r\n(Vosges), aged forty, was sharpening a scythe in an orchard close to\r\nhis house. Suddenly a terrific clap of thunder was heard, and the\r\nunfortunate man fell down stone dead.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, in the same region, at Uzemain, not far from\r\nEpinal, a young man, twenty-eight years of age, went to get grass in\r\nthe country. All at once he was struck by lightning, and his horse,\r\nwhich he was holding by the bridle, as well. The poor fellow had been\r\nguilty of the imprudence of putting his scythe on the cart with its\r\npoint in the air.\r\n\r\nOn May 27, in the Vosges, the lightning fell on a labourer, Cyrille\r\nBégin, who was driving a cart to which were yoked four horses. The\r\nunhappy man was struck, as well as two of the horses.\r\n\r\nSome authorities have attributed a doubly preservative influence to\r\numbrellas. The first is undoubtedly to shelter us from the rain; the\r\nsecond, more doubtful, is the gift of preserving us to a certain\r\nextent from the strokes of the terrible meteor. Silk, having the\r\nproperty of a veritable repulsion to lightning, one might really\r\nbelieve that umbrellas, whose covers are often made of this fabric,\r\nare protectors against the fire of heaven. But the records which we\r\npossess are not conclusive; if, now and then, the discharge becomes\r\ndistributed by means of the ribs, it also very often happens that it\r\nruns along the metal parts of the handle to whatever pieces of metal\r\nmay be on the person, finally striking the soil through the human\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nOn July 13, 1884, in the province of Liége, a man and a woman\r\nsheltering under the same umbrella were struck by lightning. The man\r\nwas killed instantly. His garments were in tatters, and the soles torn\r\nfrom his shoes. His pipe was thrown twenty yards away, as well as the\r\nartificial flowers in his companion's hat. The latter, who was\r\ncarrying the umbrella, was stunned.\r\n\r\nAt a season when, as a rule, thunder is not dreaded--December 9, 1884,\r\nto wit--two men, who were walking on either side of a schoolboy\r\nholding an umbrella, were killed by lightning. The child was merely\r\nthrown down, and got off with a few trifling wounds.\r\n\r\nIn each of these cases, the person who carried the umbrella suffered\r\nless from the electric discharge, but did not escape altogether,\r\nnevertheless. It may be remarked, also, that the chief victims were\r\njust under the points of the frame, and that in all probability the\r\nelectricity passed through these points.\r\n\r\nThe fusion of metals is one of the lightning's most ordinary\r\nperformances; it has occurred at times in considerable quantities.\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 1807, a fulminant discharge struck the windmill at Great\r\nMarton, in Lancashire. A thick iron chain, used for hoisting up the\r\ncorn, must have been, if not actually melted, at any rate considerably\r\nsoftened. Indeed, the links were dragged downwards by the weight of\r\nthe lower part, and meeting, became soldered in such a way that, after\r\nthe stroke of lightning, the chain was a veritable bar of iron.\r\n\r\nHow, one asks, can this truly formidable fusion take place during the\r\nswift passage of the electric spark, which disappears, it may well be\r\nsaid, \"with lightning speed.\"\r\n\r\nWhat magic force gives the fiery bolt from the sky the power to\r\ntransform the atmosphere into a veritable forge, in which kilos of\r\nmetal are melted in the thousandth part of a second!\r\n\r\nGreat leaden pipes melt like a lump of sugar in a glass of water,\r\nletting the contents escape.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, June 19, 1903, lightning broke tempestuously into a kitchen,\r\nand, melting the gaspipes, set fire to the place.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, the meteor breaking into the workshop of a\r\nlocksmith, files and other tools hanging from a rack on the wall were\r\nsoldered to the nails with which the iron ferrules of their handles\r\ncame in contact, and were with difficulty pulled apart.\r\n\r\nA house at Dorking, Sussex, received a visit from lightning on July\r\n16, 1750. Nails, bolts, and divers small objects were soldered\r\ntogether in groups of six, seven, eight, or ten, just as if they had\r\nbeen thrown into a crucible.\r\n\r\n\"Money melts, leaving the purse uninjured,\" says Seneca. \"The\r\nsword-blade liquifies, while the scabbard remains intact. The iron in\r\nthe javelin runs down the handle, which is none the worse.\"\r\n\r\nWe could add other examples, quite as unheard of, as those enumerated\r\nby the preceptor of Nero.\r\n\r\nA hat-wire melted into nothing, though the paper in which it was\r\nwrapped was not burnt.\r\n\r\nKnives and forks were melted without the least injury being done to\r\nthe linen which enveloped them, by the presence of the fluid.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings give proof of exquisitely delicate feelings; it is a\r\npity the lightning does not always behave in the same way.\r\n\r\nWires, and particularly bell-wires, make the most agreeable playthings\r\nfor the lightning, judging from the frequency with which they are\r\nstruck.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the middle of a fearful thunderstorm, the doorbell is\r\nviolently rung; the porter rushes to open the door for the impatient\r\nvisitor, only to receive a shock of lightning by way of salvo. The\r\nmysterious hand which pulled the bell is already far away; but it has\r\nleft its impress on the bell, and the guiding ray follows the metal\r\nwire in all its windings, passing through holes no bigger than the\r\nhead of a pin. The wires are often melted into globules, and scattered\r\naround in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Richard has seen globules from a bell-wire fall into coffee\r\ncups, and become embedded in the porcelain, without the latter being\r\nany the worse.\r\n\r\nMetal wires supporting espaliers and vines are often compromising to\r\nthe safety of their neighbourhood, especially when they are against a\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nWithout renouncing the succulent peach, or the golden chasselas\r\ngrapes, propped on espaliers, we ought to see that they are so\r\narranged that they do not act as lightning-conductors to our\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1868, in a farm amongst the mountains near Lyons, lightning\r\nfell at a distance of about fifteen metres from a dwelling where there\r\nwere four people; the meteor, conducted by the wire supporting a vine\r\non a trellis, followed it into the house, and knocked the four people\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nOne could almost believe that lightning takes a certain pleasure in\r\nlooking at its diaphanous and fugitive form in the mirrors hung as\r\nornaments in our drawing-rooms.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, a very coquettish flash of lightning rushed to a mirror,\r\nbreaking more than ten openings in the gilt frame. Then it evaporated\r\nthe gilding, spreading it over the surface of the glass, while on the\r\nsilvered back the evaporation of this latter metal produced the most\r\nbeautiful electric traceries.\r\n\r\nSometimes the tinfoil or pieces of melted glass are thrown to a great\r\ndistance; and at times the fusion of the glass is so complete that the\r\n_débris_ hangs down like little stalactites.\r\n\r\nAs for the gilding of the frames, it is often carefully removed by the\r\nlightning to a distance, and applied to the gilding of objects which\r\nwere never intended to receive this style of decoration.\r\n\r\nIt is just the same with the gilding on clocks, cornices, church\r\nornaments, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are innumerable examples coming under this category. Here are a\r\nfew:--\r\n\r\nOn March 15, at Naples, lightning flashed through the rooms of Lord\r\nTylney, who was holding a reception that evening. More than five\r\nhundred were present; without any person being injured, the lightning\r\ntook the gilding clean off cornices, curtain-poles, couches, and\r\ndoor-posts; then it shook its booty in a fine gold dust over the\r\nguests and the floor.\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 1797, lightning struck the steeple of Philippshofen in\r\nBohemia, and went off with the gold of the clock, to gild the lead in\r\nthe chapel window.\r\n\r\nIn 1761, it went into the church of the Academical College in Vienna,\r\nand took the gold from the cornice of one of the altar pillars to put\r\nit on a silver vase.\r\n\r\nIt seems difficult for lightning to resist the attraction of gildings.\r\nIt was reported that when a house in the Rue Plumet in Paris was\r\nstruck in 1767, among several frames hanging in a room, the spark only\r\ntouched one which was gilt. None of the others were struck.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this extraordinarily independent behaviour, lightning has\r\nnot so much liberty of action as we might be tempted to believe; it\r\nobeys certain laws which are not yet defined, and its gestures,\r\nalthough apparently wild and capricious, are not the result of\r\nfortuitous circumstances. To allude to it as chance may serve as a\r\nrefuge from ignorance, but it does not, any more than we can, explain\r\nthe extraordinary phenomena.\r\n\r\nWhy are certain organic or non-organic bodies visited repeatedly by\r\nlightning? We need not have recourse to magic to explain.\r\n\r\nIt is simply because they serve as favourable conductors for the fluid.\r\nOne of the best-known examples of this kind is that of the church of\r\nAntrasme. It was struck by lightning in 1752. It melted the gold of\r\nthe picture frames adorning the sanctuary, blackened the edges of the\r\nniches in which the images stood, scorched the pewter vases enclosed in\r\na press in the sacristy; then, lastly, it made two very neat holes at\r\nthe end of a side chapel, by which it took its departure. The traces of\r\nthis disaster were removed with all haste, but twelve years later, on\r\nJune 20, 1764, the lightning returned to the charge. It penetrated the\r\nchurch for the second time, but the most remarkable fact is, that it\r\nworked havoc similar to that done on its first visit. Again the sacred\r\npicture-frames were despoiled of their gilding, the niches of the\r\nsaints blackened, the pewter vases scorched, and the two holes in the\r\nchapel reopened. What demon guided the lightning in these scenes of\r\npillage? The end of the story gives us the clue. Soon after the\r\ncatastrophe the use of the lightning-conductor became general\r\nthroughout the whole world. The church was put under the protection of\r\na rod of iron, after the principles of Franklin, and ever since\r\nlightning allows the faithful to pray in peace within the sanctuary,\r\nand has never returned to profane the church at Antrasme.\r\n\r\nSuch incidents are of fairly frequent occurrence; they give us a\r\nchance of understanding the supposed preferences of lightning.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we shall see curious cases of \"galvanoplasty,\" of\r\nthe nature of the following: amongst others, that of a piece of gold\r\nin a purse, which was silvered over with silver taken out of another\r\npart of the purse, through the leather of the compartment.\r\n\r\nWhat a trick of prestidigitation! On our music-hall stages this turn\r\nwould have a great success.\r\n\r\nBut our last word has not been said about lightning. Just a few more.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious effects produced on metals, is the magnetic\r\npolarity communicated to objects in steel and iron, no matter what\r\nthey be. We have already quoted a remarkable case, that of the\r\nascending lightning.\r\n\r\nA tailor was slightly touched by the spark; the day after the accident\r\nhe found his needles were magnetized: they clung closely to each other\r\nas they were taken out of the case.\r\n\r\nAnother case of magnetization has been recorded, where certain\r\nobjects, which were struck by lightning, had power to raise three\r\ntimes their own weight.\r\n\r\nThis magnetization is almost always temporary. Examples are known,\r\nhowever, where objects preserved the magnetic powers that they\r\nacquired in the moment of the shock. And one can understand the terror\r\ninspired by lightning in uncultured minds, when, after the passing of\r\nthe meteor, they see common things suddenly animated by a fantastic\r\nvitality, fine needles attract and raise very much larger bodies than\r\nthemselves, and impart a feverish agitation to any pieces of steel or\r\niron that may be placed near them.\r\n\r\nWhat a lively impression these curious phenomena must have made on the\r\nminds of men in the days when sorcery was in fashion, and when\r\nlightning was, according to the belief then popular, at the service of\r\nheaven and hell! But, nowadays, sorcery is fallen into disuse; the\r\nmagnetization of metal bodies, even when the result of lightning, is\r\nsomething too well known to be attributed to any connection with\r\nSatan.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the gambols of electricity are truly extraordinary.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, 1873, the electric fluid penetrated into a\r\nbutcher's shop, quite calmly followed the iron bars from which the\r\nquarters of meat were hanging. From one of the hooks a whole ox was\r\nsuspended. All at once the skinned carcase was galvanized by the\r\nelectric current, and during several instants it was seen convulsed by\r\nthe most frightful contortions.\r\n\r\nAgain, on June 28, 1879, a concierge in the Avenue de Clichy was\r\nsweeping his courtyard when the lightning broke at one metre above his\r\nhead. The poor man escaped with the fright. The fluid ran up the\r\nleaden pipes and entered a room, where it broke the mirrors and a\r\nclock, injured the ceiling, and got off by breaking the panes in the\r\nwindow. On the upper storey it got into a lodging occupied by two old\r\nwomen, where it caused the following damage: one of the women was\r\nholding a bowl of milk, the bottom of the bowl was cracked and the\r\nmilk spilled on the floor; some money which was in a wooden bowl\r\ndisappeared and could not be found. The clock was stopped at half-past\r\nsix, the pendulum unhooked; and a hole made in a glass globe the size\r\nof a five-shilling piece. Finally, a woman in bed on the same landing\r\nsaw the bed split in two by the lightning, which disappeared in the\r\nwall. None of these persons were injured.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, indeed, when lightning breaks into houses, although\r\nit often does a great deal of harm, it almost always spares the people\r\nwho may be there. One is safer there than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nSometimes the walls are pierced or merely hollowed. This perforation\r\nof the walls is one of the most common effects of the meteor on\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the perforated walls is very variable.\r\n\r\nAt the Castle of Clermont, in Beauvaisis, there was a formidable old\r\nwall, built in the time of the Romans, so tradition has it, which was\r\nten feet thick, and the cement was as hard as stone, so that it was\r\nalmost impossible to break it. \"One day,\" says Nollet, \"a flash of\r\nlightning struck it, and instantly a hole, two feet deep and equally\r\nwide, was made in it, the _débris_ being thrown more than fifty feet\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1883, at Louvemont (Haute-Marne), the wall of a bakehouse,\r\nfifty-five centimetres wide, was broken in by lightning.\r\n\r\nThe church at Lugdivan was struck by lightning in 1761. Two furrows\r\nlike those made by a plough were to be seen on the wall.\r\n\r\nOne of the most dreadful acts of which lightning is capable is that of\r\nhurling considerable masses of stone and rock, broken or intact, to\r\ngreat distances. We have numerous examples of this terrible\r\nphenomenon. Here are a few:--\r\n\r\nOn August 23, 1853, thunder burst over the belfry of Maison-Ponthieu.\r\nThe explosion scattered the slates and beams of the roof, and shot a\r\nstone, measuring thirty-five centimetres, to a distance of twenty\r\nmetres. Rough stones, weighing more than forty pounds, were torn up\r\nand thrown almost horizontally as far as an opposite wall thirty feet\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAt Fuzie-en-Fetlar, in Scotland, towards the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, lightning broke, in about two seconds at most, a mica-schist\r\nrock of one hundred and fifty feet long, by ten broad, and in some\r\nparts four feet thick; this it split into great pieces. One, measuring\r\ntwenty-six feet long by ten broad, and four in thickness, fell on the\r\nground twenty centimetres off. Enormous stones are thrown, at times,\r\nin different directions.\r\n\r\nIn 1762 lightning struck the belfry of Breag Church in Cornwall, broke\r\nthe stone pinnacle of the edifice, and threw one of the stones,\r\nweighing at least a hundred-weight and a half, on the roof of the\r\napsis, in a southerly direction, fifty-five metres away.\r\n\r\nIn a northerly direction another huge stone was found at 365 metres or\r\nso from the belfry; and a third, still larger, to the south-east of\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases the lightning unites a fantastic skill with this\r\nexcessive brutality. For instance, a wall has been removed intact\r\nwithout being broken in any part. Here is a record of one such\r\nextraordinary occurrence:--\r\n\r\nOn August 6, 1809, at Swinton, near Manchester, during a deluge of\r\nrain, the lightning all at once filled a brick building, in which coal\r\nwas stored, full of pestilential, sulphureous vapour. Above it was a\r\ncistern half full. Suddenly the edifice, the walls of which measured\r\nthirty centimetres in thickness, were torn out of the ground, the\r\nfoundations being sixty centimetres deep, and was transported in an\r\nupright position to a distance of ten metres.\r\n\r\nThe weight of this mass, so oddly and so rapidly moved by lightning,\r\nwas estimated at ten thousand kilograms.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, on the contrary, the subtle fluid has pulverized a\r\nhard stone on the spot and reduced it to powder.\r\n\r\nTiles and slates are very often torn off the roofs: the lightning\r\nmakes them fly through the air. Sometimes it is content to perforate\r\nthem with a multitude of little holes.\r\n\r\nAs for chimneys, they are generally very ill-treated by the meteor.\r\nThe blows of which they are victims are to be accounted for easily,\r\nfor they offer perfect powers of conducting to the fulminant matter,\r\nfirstly, because of their prominence on the summit of the building,\r\nespecially when they are surmounted by a vane. Again, the flue is\r\noften in cast-iron, and if it is bricked it is supported by bars of\r\niron. The surface of the interior is covered with a layer of soot, an\r\nexcellent conductor, and a stove-pipe often opens into it. Then, too,\r\nthe hearth and its surroundings are more or less made of metal.\r\nFinally, the column of smoke and of hot, damp air rising into the air,\r\nshows the lightning the way.\r\n\r\nThe latter often accepts this invitation, and very frequently gets\r\ninto a house by the chimney, where everything seems ready for its\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nRafters and doors are sometimes bored through with one or two holes by\r\nthe spark, and split or furrowed more or less deeply. A curious fact\r\nis that it is rare to find the slightest trace of combustion round\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1887, lightning struck the belfry of the\r\nchurch at Abrest (Allier), carrying off part of the roof.\r\n\r\nIt destroyed the walls of the porch, and in both sides of the swing\r\ndoors bored two holes, each as big as a pigeon's egg, and as\r\nsymmetrically as if they had been made by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nThe cleavage of beams is amongst the most extraordinary injuries to be\r\nobserved on woodwork. Lightning works with wrought wood just as it\r\ndoes when the tree is in full sap: it reduces it to rags, and follows\r\nthe direction of the fibres.\r\n\r\nWith what crimes lightning is charged! When it is a question of\r\nrobbing a house, it spares nothing in its way.\r\n\r\nThe window-panes fly in pieces, and sometimes are thrown a long way\r\noff. Often they are melted and disappear totally.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1783, at Campo Sampiero Castello (Padua), lightning struck a\r\nbuilding full of hay; the windows had glass in them, and the panes\r\nwere melted _without the hay catching fire_!\r\n\r\nA still more astonishing phenomenon is that of the total disappearance\r\nof the glass panes, observed at the Castle of Upsal, on August 24,\r\n1760. Lightning visited this edifice and then took flight, carrying\r\noff sixteen panes out of a window. Not the smallest fragment of them\r\nwas ever found.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, as often happens, terrific heat was generated, and the glass\r\nevaporated.\r\n\r\nIf we follow the track of lightning through rooms, very singular\r\neffects may be seen on the furniture. Chests of drawers and wardrobes\r\nare gutted, and the contents pulled out and strewn about the room. In\r\nthe middle of August, 1887, a house at Francines, near Limoges, was\r\nstruck by lightning. It fell in a room where the master of the house\r\nwas in bed. He felt a terrific shock, and saw his eiderdown pierced\r\nthrough and through by the perfidious fluid, and a chest of drawers\r\nwith all its contents broken. Continuing on its way, the lightning\r\ndemolished the door and entered another room.\r\n\r\nA man who was asleep in it was killed. His wife by his side and his\r\nlittle girl felt nothing, but _a pillow on which one of them had her\r\nhead was thrown to a distance_. Finally, the meteor went through the\r\nfloor, broke a large clock on the ground floor, setting fire to\r\neverything on its way.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1903, a fulminant ray fell on the church of\r\nCussy-la-Colonne (Côte d'Or). To start, it turned the clock tower\r\nupside down, broke a clock, then opened a cupboard in the sacristy in\r\nwhich there were various articles, and broke them all.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1886, lightning did great damage in the church at Montredon\r\n(Tarn). It demolished the steeple to an extent of three metres,\r\nseveral bells, and carried the enormous iron bar which supported them\r\na long way off. The roof of the church was burst in and the tiles were\r\npulverized in several places by the falling masonry. In the interior a\r\nbench was broken, an image of Christ reduced to powder, and a metal\r\nimage of St. Peter twisted.\r\n\r\nWe may remark, by the way, that churches are very often struck by\r\nlightning, doubtless owing to the height of the steeple above the\r\nedifice.\r\n\r\nWe have innumerable notes about ruined steeples, turrets knocked off,\r\nthe plundering of priestly objects. Sculptures and pictures adorning\r\nthe sanctuary are often destroyed, and the altar itself shattered.\r\nCases of priests struck while officiating are not uncommon. As for the\r\nfaithful killed while at church, they may be counted by the hundred.\r\n\r\nWithout wishing to call lightning a miscreant or an infidel, one is\r\nobliged to confess it fails in respect for holy places.\r\n\r\nHowever, the quips and cranks of lightning observed in dwellings are\r\nno less varied and curious.\r\n\r\nHere are some remarkable accounts:--\r\n\r\nOne night during a terrible thunderstorm, lightning came down the\r\nchimney of a room where two people were asleep. The husband awoke with\r\na start and, believing the house to be on fire, groped his way to the\r\nmantelpiece to get a candle, but was stopped by a heap of rubbish.\r\nEverything, in fact, of which the chimney had once consisted was\r\nheaped up in the middle of the room. The mantelshelf, violently torn\r\noff, had been partly melted, the clock had had the door of the case\r\npulled off, and all the window-panes were broken. On the lower storey,\r\nanother clock was similarly demolished, the floor was torn up and the\r\ntiles thrown with such force against the ceiling that there were\r\nsplinters sticking all over it.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April, 1866, at Bure (Luxembourg), the thunder, which\r\nhad been rumbling for some time, suddenly crashed down all at once\r\nabout midnight with the most appalling violence, so that the ground\r\nseemed to tremble and the houses rock on their foundations.\r\n\r\nAll the inhabitants, aroused in terror; instinctively several of them\r\nsprang out of bed, thinking that their dwellings must be annihilated.\r\nEvery one had the presentiment of disaster, which was only too real:\r\nthe fluid had just struck the house of a poor workman, and left a\r\nscene of frightful destruction behind it.\r\n\r\nThe roof had been carried off, the chimney destroyed, the windows\r\nreduced, so to speak, to atoms, the principal door smashed and hurled\r\nto a distance; of the furniture there was nothing left but shapeless\r\nwreckage. But what was most extraordinary is, that this catastrophe\r\nonly cost the life of one person, while all that were in the house\r\nmight well have been killed.\r\n\r\nThree children, sleeping in an upper storey, found themselves thrown\r\noutside the house without knowing how they got there, but _safe and\r\nsound_, though the bed was broken to pieces. The father and mother\r\nwere asleep on the ground floor, with two little children, one of whom\r\nwas at the breast. This latter was flung out of his cradle and thrown\r\nagainst the wall, without being hurt.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the mother sprang out of bed to succour those dear to\r\nher, but while the poor woman was in the act of lighting a candle, the\r\nlightning struck her lifeless on the floor. The husband, who was in\r\nthe bed with another child, only felt a severe shaking. The lightning,\r\nhaving accomplished its work of destruction, finally broke an opening\r\nin the lower part of the wall, went into the stable adjoining the\r\nhouse, and there killed the only cow that was in it.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1868, at Liége, Rue du Calvaire, at the point\r\nwhere the mountain of St. Laurent is highest, lightning first of all\r\nstruck two earthenware chimney-pots which were higher than the roofs.\r\nOne of these pots was thrown to the ground and broken, the other\r\ndisappeared. Then the electric spark ripped off a great part of the\r\nroof. All the tiles were scattered round the house. A young servant\r\nslept in a garret under the roof; the lightning penetrated into the\r\ngarret through a little hole in the wall just above the head of the\r\nmaid's bed; the latter was flung into the middle of the room without\r\nthe slightest bruise, though the wood of the bed was bored through in\r\ntwo places.\r\n\r\nFrom there, the spark going through the wall again, went down to the\r\nground floor, following the gutter pipe, which it broke. It re-entered\r\nthe house by making a little hole in the wall, pulled off the plaster\r\nwhich was round two nails holding up a mirror, broke part of the\r\nframe; again left the room, entered a little room adjoining where six\r\npeople were sleeping--the father, the mother, and four young children;\r\npierced the wall to enter a locksmith's, scattered all the tools, tore\r\nout a drawer, broke it into a thousand pieces, and threw the contents\r\non the floor, broke all the panes of glass; again went through the\r\nwall, went to a hutch with a rabbit in it, killed the animal, and at\r\nlast went into the garden, where it dug a double trench several feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe house was occupied by two families of ten persons, none of whom\r\nwere struck. Terrified by the report they rose instantly; the smell of\r\nsmoke filling all the rooms told them of the danger they had just\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion one sees the woodwork of the chimney burnt, as\r\nwell as a press, a looking-glass, and a clock badly injured by the\r\nlightning; which before retiring, and by way of being a good joke,\r\nturns a felt hat upside down, and unscrews the andirons.\r\n\r\nExamples of this kind are very numerous. We constantly speak of the\r\ncaprices of the lightning, but what name could one give to anything so\r\nburlesque or incomprehensible as the following:--\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, 1896, lightning fell in the village of Boulens,\r\non a cottage almost covered with thatch. Entering through the chimney,\r\nwhich it destroyed, it first threw down a rack, pulling out the hinge\r\nwhich held it up, and making in the place of the said hinge a hole\r\nright through the wall. Afterwards it lifted a pot and the lid from\r\nthe hearth over to the middle of the floor, tearing up some tiles as\r\nit went. It broke the latch of the hall door, as well as the key which\r\nwas in the lock; this latter was found afterwards in a wooden shoe\r\nwhich was under the sideboard. Two canes that were beside the\r\nmantelpiece, were laid on the said mantelpiece as if placed there by\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nA meat chopper and a copper basin used for ladling water out of a\r\npail, and attached to either end of the stove, were likewise thrown\r\ninto the middle of the room. But the oddest part was that these two\r\narticles were fastened together, the twine which served to hang up the\r\nchopper being rolled round the handle of the basin. Finally, the\r\nflash divided, and zigzagged off, one part carrying off a piece of the\r\noak jamb of the hall door, the other part piercing a hole above the\r\nstove in a mud wall. Through this it threw fragments of laths and\r\nmortar into a window eleven metres off, near which two people were\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nThis little dance, in which so many and various articles took part,\r\ndoes not lack piquancy!\r\n\r\nThis is how lightning joins in the National Fête of France!\r\n\r\nOn July 14, 1884, in the village of Tourettes (Vaucluse), lightning\r\nstruck a house, carrying off a corner of the roof. It knocked off the\r\nlower part of the roof, and broke through a wall at least fifty\r\ncentimetres thick.\r\n\r\nIn a press built half into the wall, and in which there were about\r\nfifteen bottles containing various kinds of liqueur, only one bottle\r\nof spirits was broken, and this was done in such a manner that no\r\ntrace could ever be found either of the glass or the liquid.\r\n\r\nFrom thence it sprang to the pictures hanging above the head of a\r\nlittle girl of five, who was sound asleep. Three pictures were torn\r\nfrom their frames, engravings and mirrors were ground to powder, but\r\nthe child was not hurt. Then the electric current made an opening in\r\nthe ceiling, which was about forty-five centimetres thick, broke a\r\ngreat many tiles as it left the house, but soon returned by way of\r\nthe chimney, three parts of which it demolished. Then it explored the\r\nkitchen on the ground floor, where there were three men by a fire.\r\nOne, standing up, was thrown violently against the opposite wall;\r\nanother was hurled against the door; the third, seated, was raised\r\nfrom his chair to a height of at least fifty centimetres, and then\r\ndropped. To crown all, the spark tore away half the butt-end of a gun,\r\nand carried it into the next room, where there were eleven people who\r\ngot off with nothing worse than the fright. Then going up the chimney,\r\nit exploded at a height of 1·50 metre, throwing bits of plaster and of\r\nthe pothanger in all directions.\r\n\r\nWhat frantic and almost childlike fury!\r\n\r\nYet somewhere else the very brother of this ray may caress the little\r\nhead of a sleeping child, and not do it the slightest harm; may scoop\r\na hole in the little cot, and then depart quietly without giving any\r\nfurther cause for talk. Or this same lightning, terrible and\r\nungovernable at times, will snatch something out of a person's hand\r\nwith so much dexterity, one might almost say delicacy, that one would\r\nhardly dare to reproach him with his lack of ceremony.\r\n\r\nAt Perpignan on August 31, 1895, lightning fell on the mountains of\r\nNyer, near Olette. Twenty-five out of a flock of sheep were struck.\r\nThe shepherd was enveloped by a flash, yet escaped, but the knife he\r\nwas holding in his hand disappeared--and likewise his dog.\r\n\r\nAnother time it fell on a house at Beaumont (Puy-de-Dôme), flashed\r\nthrough every part of it, blew up the stone staircase, and did\r\nconsiderable damage. It grazed a woman who was sitting with a cup in\r\nher hand, but she was not hurt, though the cup was rudely torn out of\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1886, a labourer was in the act of mowing, when lightning\r\ncoming on unawares, stole his scythe and threw it 10 metres away. The\r\nman was not in the least hurt.\r\n\r\nThe following example is truly amazing from this point of view.\r\n\r\nA woman was busy milking a cow, when suddenly she saw a tongue of fire\r\nshoot into the stable and round it, pass between a cow and the wall at\r\na place where there was not more than 30 or 35 centimetres of space,\r\nand finally go out of the door without leaving any marks, or hurting\r\nany living thing.\r\n\r\nVery often lightning contents itself with making a frightful hubbub,\r\nand breaking any china or glass it may come across.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1886, thunder burst over a house at Langres. It was at\r\nbreakfast-time. The fluid came down the chimney, which it swept\r\nthoroughly, came near the table, ran between the legs of an astounded\r\nguest, and then knocked a hole as big as a shilling in the neck of a\r\nbottle which was being filled at the pump. Then it took itself off to\r\nthe courtyard, which it swept clean, and disappeared without hurting\r\nany of the witnesses of this strange phenomenon.\r\n\r\nOn August 3, 1898, two women were in the dining-room of their house at\r\nConfolens, when lightning broke a pane of glass in the window, and\r\npassing within a few metres of them, went through the kitchen, and\r\ndisappeared through the wall, after having broken several cooking\r\nutensils and the mantelpiece into atoms.\r\n\r\nAt Port-de-Bouc, on August 21, 1900, lightning struck the custom\r\nhouse, went into the room of one of the officials, and cut clean in\r\ntwo a china vase, which was on the mantelpiece, without separating the\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later, on August 26, the mysterious fluid came to disturb\r\nthe peaceful repast of two honest labourers. Having taken refuge from\r\nthe storm in a hut, they had set out their provisions for breakfast.\r\nAll at once the thunderstorm burst into the humble dining-room,\r\nsnatched up the bread, cheese, etc., overturned the bottles and other\r\narticles, covered everything with straw, as if by a violent gust of\r\nwind. The labourers felt nothing but stupefaction.\r\n\r\nWas not it a veritable farce?\r\n\r\nIn another place it bursts open a cupboard, throwing the door away,\r\nand damaging the crockery in the most systematic fashion: it breaks\r\nthe first plate, leaves the second intact, cracks the next, spares the\r\nfourth, and so on to the bottom of the pile. Then its task finished,\r\nit becomes quite diminutive, like some little gnome out of a fairy\r\nstory, and flees through the keyhole, but without making the key\r\nspring out of the lock.\r\n\r\nOn August 19, 1866, at Chaumont, lightning, having played havoc in a\r\nhouse in various ways, espied a pile of plates in a cupboard, china\r\nand earthenware plates being mixed, it broke all the china ones,\r\nleaving the others untouched.\r\n\r\nWhy this preference? The lightning does not explain. It is for us to\r\nfind out.\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 1903, at Tillieu-sous-Aire (Eure), during a thunderstorm, a\r\nnumber of china plates were filled with a kind of sticky water. The\r\nearthenware plates beside them were not even wet. I received a little\r\nflask of this water sent me by the parish priest, but analysis\r\nrevealed nothing unusual.\r\n\r\nThe following case gives a formal denial to the ancient prejudice\r\nwhich attributes a cabalistic influence to the number thirteen.\r\n\r\nThere were thirteen people in the dining-room of a house at Langonar\r\nwhile the thunder rumbled outside. Suddenly a flash of lightning\r\nstruck a plate in the middle of the table, threw dishes, glasses,\r\nplates, knives, and forks in all directions--in a word, cleared the\r\ntable, not forgetting the tablecloth.\r\n\r\nNone of the thirteen guests were touched.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens, indeed, that glasses or bottles are altogether\r\nor partly melted. Boyle gives a very curious instance of the kind.\r\n\r\nTwo large drinking glasses were side by side on a table. They were\r\nexactly alike. Lightning seemed to pass between them, yet neither was\r\nbroken; one was slightly distorted, however, and the other so much\r\nbent by an instantaneous softening that it could hardly stand.\r\n\r\nWhen firearms are struck by lightning, their injuries are often of the\r\nmost varied kind. Sometimes the wood, particularly of the butt-end, is\r\nsplit, or broken to pieces, the metal parts torn out, or thrown right\r\naway.\r\n\r\nOn July 27, 1721, the meteor struck a sentry-box at Fort Nicolai,\r\nBreslau, and pierced the top to get at the sentry and his gun. The\r\nbarrel was blackened; the butt-end broken and thrown to a distance.\r\nThe shot had been discharged and pierced the roof of the sentry-box.\r\n\r\nThe man got off with a few scratches.\r\n\r\nHowever, firearms when carried by men appear to attract the lightning.\r\nSoldiers are often enough struck when in the exercise of their\r\ncalling, when they are carrying arms.\r\n\r\nBut, curiously enough, many cases are known in which lightning has\r\nstruck a loaded gun, melting the bullet and part of the barrel,\r\nwithout setting fire to the powder.\r\n\r\nThus, at Prefling, lightning penetrated the room of a gamekeeper, yet\r\nnone of the many firearms hanging up went off. The wall was damaged\r\nbetween each rifle. One was standing in a corner of the room; the wall\r\nwas injured on a level with the lower end, and above it a hole was to\r\nbe seen in the woodwork.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1761, near Nimburg, lightning burst into the house of a\r\nhorse-keeper, where it struck a loaded carbine leaning against a wall\r\non the ground floor. The muzzle was slightly melted by the spark,\r\nwhich ran along the barrel to the trigger, and which it soldered\r\ntogether in parts. There were five bullets melted and soldered\r\ntogether in the magazine and the wads much scorched. However,\r\nincredible as it may seem, there was no explosion.\r\n\r\nIn another case the lightning went the whole length of a rifle, both\r\ninside and outside, leaving a direct line of fusion, and yet,\r\nincredible though it may seem, no shot was fired though the fusion\r\nreached the powder.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena appear quite extraordinary, and altogether\r\nincompatible with the usual theory of the combustibleness of\r\ngunpowder. To what cause can the invulnerability of the explosive\r\nmatter be due?\r\n\r\nDoubtless to the quickness of the lightning, which does not leave the\r\npowder time enough to ignite.\r\n\r\nPowder magazines are frequently struck by lightning, and this subject\r\nis one of very great interest; they are not always blown up, in spite\r\nof the vast quantities of explosive materials which they contain.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples which go to prove this statement:--\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 1755, lightning fell near Rouen on the Maromme powder\r\nmagazine, and split one of the beams of the roof. Two barrels of\r\npowder were reduced to atoms without exploding. The magazine contained\r\neight hundred of these barrels.\r\n\r\nCan it be that man's thunder can repulse that of Jupiter?\r\n\r\nNot always, as numerous examples prove the contrary. The following\r\nobservations are extracted from a collection of similar facts:--\r\n\r\nLightning struck the tower of St. Nazaire, Brecia, on August 18, 1769.\r\nIt stood above an underground magazine containing a million\r\nkilogrammes of powder belonging to the Republic of Venice. The whole\r\nedifice was blown up, the stones falling in showers. Part of the town\r\nwas thrown down; three thousand people perishing.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon of October 6, 1856, lightning\r\npenetrated the vaults of the church of St Jean, at Rhodes, setting\r\nfire to an enormous quantity of powder. Four or five thousand people\r\nlost their lives in the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe power of lightning is immeasurable. Well, it sometimes enjoys\r\nitself after the following manner:--\r\n\r\nIn 1899 it lit a candle which had just been put out. The person who\r\nheld it was not struck, but the shock sent him to sleep for four days;\r\nthen he awoke, only to go mad, and then slept for seven consecutive\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAt Harbourg it put out all the lights at a ball; the room was plunged\r\nin darkness, and filled with thick and fetid vapour.\r\n\r\nMany a time, too, has a fire, burning brightly in a grate, been\r\nsuddenly extinguished by lightning; and the same thing has happened\r\nwith pottery and tile-making furnaces. As a rule, it is extremely\r\ndifficult to re-light candles or fires thus extinguished. In some\r\ninstances it takes on itself to light the gas.\r\n\r\nOn August 3, 1876, near the Observatory in Paris, Rue Leclerc, towards\r\nthe corner of the Boulevard Saint Jacques, a gas jet was lit by\r\nlightning. The latter was twenty centimetres from a long gutter, and\r\nwas in the gap, so to speak, of an electric circuit formed by it and\r\nthe damp wall communicating with the ground. A violent explosion took\r\nplace at the moment the gas caught alight, the gas meter, on the wall\r\ntwo metres above it, was dislodged, when a second explosion was heard.\r\nThe thunderclap was truly terrific, and immediately followed the\r\nlightning flash. The chronometer in the meteorological bureau in the\r\nObservatory was stopped suddenly. The keeper of the square of the\r\nLuxembourg saw a ball of red fire explode with great violence, and\r\nscatter in all directions. The plate belonging to the Pères was,\r\naccording to M. de Fonvielle, broken to a thousand pieces, and the\r\nouter part of an iron bar was volatilized. There were no deaths or\r\ninjuries to record, although several people were thrown down by the\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nSometimes great disasters are indirectly caused by lightning. Thus in\r\nJuly, 1903, it set fire to an old house at Muda, Paluzzo. Under other\r\ncircumstances, the accident might have been insignificant. But, fanned\r\nby a violent wind, the flames increased, and, approaching nearer and\r\nnearer, burned a hundred houses, or in other words, the whole village.\r\n\r\nA similar catastrophe took place at the village of Ochres, in\r\nDauphine, on August 27, 1900. Lightning set fire to twenty thatched\r\ncottages, which, out of thirty-two composing the village, were in\r\nashes within less than an hour. Three persons were burnt alive, and\r\nfour others seriously injured.\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 1881, lightning struck the village of Saint Innocent, at\r\nthree o'clock in the morning. Seven houses were totally burnt, and\r\nthree women perished in the flames.\r\n\r\nA fire caused by lightning burst out on June 24, 1872, at Perrigny,\r\nnear Pontailler (Côte d'Or). Seventeen houses were burnt, and\r\nseventy-eight people found themselves homeless. Sometimes these\r\ndisasters attain terrifying proportions.\r\n\r\nDuring an awful thunderstorm, the electric spark set fire to eighteen\r\nparishes in Belgium; ruin spread over an area of 160 kilometres.\r\n\r\nBut could anything be more dreadful than the fate of certain ships\r\nthat have been struck by lightning?\r\n\r\nHere is the case of one which was literally cut in two.\r\n\r\nOn August 3, 1862, the ship _Moses_, on her passage from Ibraila to\r\nQueenstown, was overtaken in sight of Malta by a violent thunderstorm.\r\nTowards midnight lightning struck the mainmast, and then downwards\r\nalong it to the hold, cutting the vessel in two. She filled\r\nimmediately. Crew and passengers were lost. Captain Pearson was on the\r\nbridge, and had just time to catch a floating spar, which supported\r\nhim during seventeen hours. The ship sank in three minutes.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of last century, the ship _Royal Charlotte_ being\r\nin Diamond Harbour, on the Hoogley, was struck by lightning and blown\r\ninto a thousand pieces, through the explosion of her powder magazine.\r\nThe report was heard a great distance off, and the shock was felt for\r\nmiles around.\r\n\r\nThe form and position of the masts exposes them particularly to the\r\nattacks of the dread meteor. Several examples are known of sailors\r\nbeing struck by the electric current while aloft in the rigging, and\r\neven being thrown from there into the sea.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 1900, the steamer _Numidie_, sailing from Bone, was\r\nstruck by lightning. The fluid fell on the mizzen-mast, and went down\r\nthe standing jib, to which the second officer was clinging. The\r\nunfortunate man had had both his hands paralyzed and fallen; but if he\r\nhad fallen on the outside of the draille, death would have been\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nThe _Rodney_ was under weigh before Syracuse when it was struck. This\r\nwas on December 7, 1838. The top-gallant-mast went first; it weighed\r\neight hundred pounds, and such was the violence of the stroke that it\r\nwas instantly reduced to shavings, which hung the whole length of the\r\nvessel, like rubbish in a carpenter's shop. The topmast was very much\r\ndamaged and shattered here and there. As for the mainmast, with its\r\nironwork weighing more than a ton, it was wrecked for a length of some\r\nseventeen metres.\r\n\r\nAt times the masts are split from top to bottom, broken or cut\r\ntransversely in fragments, and flung to a distance. Sometimes they\r\nare planed, like the beams and trees of which we have already spoken.\r\n\r\nThe _Blake_ was struck by lightning in 1812. The top-gallant-mast was\r\nin green pine, which was split into long fibres in every direction,\r\nlike branches of a tree.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual for lightning to creep into the heart of a mast and\r\ndo it all kinds of injuries, without in any way hurting the outside;\r\nin a word, there may be single or double furrows, longitudinal or\r\nzigzag, sometimes curved, and of varying depth. Sometimes also, the\r\nelectric current, far more powerful than the blast of the wind, seizes\r\nthe rigging and carries it off. This phenomenon was observed on the\r\n_Clenker_, December 31, 1828; the topmast and sails were torn off and\r\nthrown into the water. Neither are the sails spared by the terrible\r\nmeteor; they are torn, riddled with holes, or set on fire. But as a\r\nrule the yards are spared.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frightful effects of thunder on ships is fire, which\r\nit drives from one part of the vessel to another. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances it is usually local, and easily extinguished; but when\r\nit seizes on various parts of the ship at once, as when struck by\r\nlightning, then destruction becomes inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 the _King George_ from Bombay was sailing up the river at\r\nCanton, when an electric spark, followed by a violent clap of thunder,\r\ngrazed the mizzen-mast, and disappeared in the hold, after killing\r\nseven men. Seven hours later it was discovered with consternation that\r\nthe hold, full of an inflammable cargo, was on fire. It spread rapidly\r\nover the whole ship, which it burned to the water's edge.\r\n\r\nThe ship _Bayfield_ from Liverpool was struck by lightning November\r\n25, 1845. Instantly the deck was seen covered with globes of fire and\r\nlarge sparks, which set fire to the vessel. As it threatened the\r\npowder-magazine, the captain decided to abandon the ship. A rush was\r\nmade for the boats, but as only thirty pounds of bread could be saved,\r\nmany perished of hunger and thirst.\r\n\r\nOften, indeed, the explosion of the powder-magazine makes the\r\ncatastrophe even more terrible. Thus, in 1798, the English vessel the\r\n_Resistance_, was blown up in the Straits of Malacca. Only two or\r\nthree of the crew were saved.\r\n\r\nBut lightning plays more tricks with the compass than with anything\r\nelse when it visits a ship. The vibrating, quivering, magnetic needle\r\nis often paralyzed by the electric current; sometimes its poles are\r\nreversed, or the points, disturbed by the passage of the spark,\r\ndeviate, and no longer responding to the magnetic pole, mislead and\r\nmove hither and thither.\r\n\r\nSometimes they even lose all their magnetic properties.\r\n\r\nThese changes in the compass often lead to disastrous consequences.\r\nMany cases are known of ships being steered to destruction through the\r\ndeviation of the compass. Arago tells of a Genoese ship which, about\r\nthe year 1808, sailing for Marseilles, was struck a little way off\r\nAlgiers. The needles of the compasses all made half a revolution,\r\nalthough the instruments did not appear to be injured, and the vessel\r\nwas wrecked on the coast when the pilot believed he could round the\r\ncape to the north. This may account for the total disappearance of\r\ncertain ships.\r\n\r\nSome ships, like certain individuals and certain trees, appear in\r\nparticular to attract the electric fluid. We have many records of\r\nvessels struck several times in the course of a single electric storm.\r\nHere are a few:--\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1750, the _Malacca_ was struck repeatedly.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, the _Competitor_ was struck twice within an hour.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of December, 1770, between Mahon and Malta, the ship\r\nof a Russian admiral was struck three times in a single night.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 1830, in the Straits of Corfu, the _Madagascar_ received\r\nfive destructive discharges in two hours.\r\n\r\nWe could add many others to this list. But enough. And yet we have\r\nnot said the last word on the subject. We have to discuss the\r\ninterchange of sympathetic currents, and those which are the reverse,\r\ntaking place between the electricity of the skies and that of the\r\ntelegraph.\r\n\r\nLightning often comes incognito to visit the earth's surface, or even\r\nthe depths of the ocean. These little excursions to our terrestrial\r\ndominions usually pass unperceived; however, in certain cases the\r\ntelegraph wires commit the indiscretion of revealing them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we know that the wires entrusted with carrying our\r\nthoughts round the world, are almost inconceivably sensitive. Without\r\nbeing conscious of the fact, they are in correspondence with the sun,\r\n149 millions of kilometres away, and any agitation on the surface of\r\nthis luminary may cause them indescribable agitation, as we witnessed\r\nat the close of the year 1903.\r\n\r\nDuring the formidable magnetic tempest of the 31st October,\r\ntelegraphic and telephonic communication were interrupted in many\r\nparts of the world. In fact, the phenomenon was observed all over the\r\nsurface of the globe. From nine o'clock in the morning, till four in\r\nthe afternoon, the old world and the new were strangers to one\r\nanother. Not a word nor a thought crossed the ocean; the submarine\r\ncables were paralyzed on account of solar disturbances. In France,\r\ncommunication between the principal towns and the frontiers was\r\ninterrupted. During this time the sun was in a condition of violent\r\nagitation, and its surface vibrated with intense heat. In such times\r\nthe subtle fluid profits by the confusion to glide noiselessly along\r\nthe paths which are open to it. But he does not always wait for these\r\nfavourable opportunities.\r\n\r\nLet a thunder-cloud pass over the telegraph wires, either noiselessly\r\nor hurling petards in all directions, the line will be affected. The\r\nfluid imprisoned in the sky will act by induction on the electricity\r\nof the wires which will result in the vibration of the latter,\r\naccompanied sometimes by a flash of lightning. These phenomena may\r\ncause grave accidents to the telegraph clerks, unless they are on\r\ntheir guard against the treachery of the lightning. These mute\r\ndischarges happen frequently, but the spark strikes the telegraph\r\nwires often, too, as well as the apparatus in the office. All sorts of\r\naccidents result from these repeated attacks.\r\n\r\nWe know, for instance, how the birds fall victims to the lightning\r\nwhen they alight on the telegraph wires after a thunderstorm; they are\r\noften found dead hanging by their claws.\r\n\r\nBut the fluid acts on man also, through the medium of the wires.\r\n\r\nThus, on April 13, 1863, a telegraph clerk was engaged with several\r\nother employees repairing some telegraph wires in the station at\r\nPontarlier, when all at once they felt, at the knee-joints more\r\nparticularly, a violent shock which made them bend their legs as if\r\nthey had been struck with a stick; one of them was even thrown down.\r\nNo doubt the fluid reached the wires, which in those remote parts was\r\nin charge of the clerks.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 1848, during a violent thunderstorm, two telegraph\r\npoles were thrown down at Zara in Dalmatia. Two hours later, as they\r\nwere being set up again, a couple of artillerymen, having seized the\r\nwire, felt slight electric shocks, then suddenly found themselves flat\r\non the ground. Both had their hands burnt; one indeed, gave no sign of\r\nlife; the other, in trying to raise himself up, fell back as soon as\r\nhis arm came in contact with that of one of his comrades, who ran to\r\nhis assistance on hearing him cry for help. The latter thrown down in\r\nturn, felt his nerves tingle, and giddiness seize him, with singing in\r\nhis ears. When his arm was uncovered, there was a superficial burn\r\njust on the spot where he had been touched.\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 1867, lightning fell on the road from Bastogne to Houffalize\r\n(Luxembourg), attracted by the telegraph wire, which it destroyed for\r\nabout a kilometre. At a certain part, and over a length of about\r\ntwenty metres, the wire was cut in small pieces, three or four\r\ncentimetres long, which were scattered over the ground, and were as\r\nblack and as fragile as charcoal. The poles which supported them, and\r\nseveral poplars planted on the same side of the road, were more or\r\nless damaged.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that trees planted on the same side as a\r\ntelegraph line were sometimes blasted on a level with the wires. It is\r\nthe same with houses near the copper threads along which human\r\nthoughts take wing. Thus, at Chateauneuf-Martignes, on August 25,\r\n1900, lightning destroyed the telegraph poles on the outskirts of the\r\nrailway-station. A severe shock, like an electrical discharge, was\r\nfelt at the same moment by two people who were in bed, not far from\r\nwhere the wire was fixed in the wall of the house, which was a very\r\nlow one. The same phenomenon had been felt there already.\r\n\r\nIn the railway-stations, as well as in the telegraph and telephone\r\noffices, curious results of the spark passing at a certain distance,\r\nor even in the immediate neighbourhood, are sometimes observed.\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1852, towards five o'clock, the sky looking overcast, the\r\nstation-master at Havre warned his colleague at Beuzeville that it\r\nwould be well to put his apparatus in connection with the ground.\r\nBeuzeville is twenty-five kilometres away from Havre, and at the\r\nformer station the weather then did not look at all threatening. But\r\nclouds soon piled up, driven before a violent wind. Suddenly three\r\nawful peals of thunder succeeded each other in quick succession. With\r\nthe last, lightning struck a farm about a kilometre from the station,\r\nand at the same moment a globe of fire of a reddish brown, and\r\napparently about the size of a small bomb-shell, rose as if out of a\r\nclump of trees. It glided through the air like an aerolite, and\r\nleaving behind it a train of light. At a hundred metres or so from the\r\nstation, it alighted like a bird on the telegraph wires, then\r\ndisappeared with the rapidity of lightning, leaving no trace of its\r\npassage, either on the wires or the station. But at Beuzeville several\r\ninteresting phenomena were observed. Firstly, the needles turned\r\nrapidly, with a grating noise like that of a turnspit suddenly running\r\ndown, or like a grindstone sharpening iron, which emits sparks. A\r\ngreat number, indeed, flew out of the apparatus. One of the needles,\r\nthat on the Rouen side, went out of order; all the screws on that part\r\nof the instrument were unscrewed, and on the copper dial near the axis\r\nof the needle, there was a hole through which one could pass a grain\r\nof corn.\r\n\r\nThe instruments at Havre were unaffected. The needle remained as\r\nusual, also the dial, screws, and so on.\r\n\r\nOne of our correspondents has sent me the following very interesting\r\ncommunication:--\r\n\r\n\"On June 26, 1901, having rung up at the central telephone-office at\r\nSt. Pierre, Martinique, a harsh noise was heard, which was almost\r\nimmediately succeeded by the appearance of a ball of fire, having an\r\napparent diameter of twenty centimetres, and the brilliancy of an\r\nelectric light of twenty candle power. This voluminous globe followed\r\nthe telephone wire towards the instrument. Arrived near the receiver,\r\nit burst with a terrific explosion. The witness of this phenomenon\r\nfelt a severe shock, and dizziness. Recovered from his stupefaction,\r\nhe noted the following facts: the telephone apparatus was completely\r\nburnt, the relay of Morse's installation was slightly damaged. The\r\nelectrical tension must have been enormous, for the wire of the\r\nbobbins was, to a great extent, melted.\"\r\n\r\nThis latter effect, however, occurs very frequently. Not only does the\r\nlightning melt and break the telegraph wires, but it injures the poles\r\nwhich support them.\r\n\r\nThese are sometimes broken, split, thrown down, burst, or splintered,\r\nsometimes into threads or shavings. Poles which have been blasted are\r\noften to be seen alternating with others which are uninjured. Thus, on\r\nthe line from Philadelphia to New York, during a great storm, every\r\nalternate pole up to eight was broken or thrown down; the odd numbers\r\nwere uninjured. We have mentioned a similar case already.\r\n\r\nThere are several accounts, too, of lightning in pursuit of trains.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1903, travellers by train from Carhaix to Morlaix, between\r\nSorignac and Le Cloistre, saw lightning follow the train over a course\r\nof six kilometres, breaking or splitting several telegraph poles.\r\n\r\nThis feat has been observed more than once. The train is escorted by\r\nlightning flashes which succeed each other almost without cessation,\r\nand the travellers seem to be whirled through an ocean of flame.\r\n\r\nLightning rarely strikes the carriages; only on one occasion did it\r\nactually wreck one, by breaking a wheel. The mutilated coach, however,\r\ncontinued to hobble along until the injury was discovered.\r\n\r\nGenerally the fluid is content to wander about the rails, to the great\r\nterror of the passengers who witness this display of rather alarming\r\nmagic. It spreads itself over masses of iron, as for instance the\r\nroofs and balconies in Paris, without striking any particular point.\r\n\r\nThe danger would be greater to a cyclist on a road. In the suburbs of\r\nBrussels, on July 2, 1904, a cyclist named Jean Ollivier, aged\r\ntwenty-one years, was riding during a violent storm, when suddenly he\r\nwas struck and killed on the spot.\r\n\r\nWe shall end this description of the whims and caprices of lightning\r\nby a notice of the blasting of a German military balloon. It\r\nhappened in June, 1902. The aeronaut, whose car was steered by a\r\nsub-lieutenant, was held captive, and soared at a height of about 500\r\nmetres above the fortifications at Lechfeld, near Ingolstadt. All at\r\nonce the aerial skiff was touched by an electric spark, caught fire,\r\nand began to descend, slowly at first, then swiftly. The aeronaut had\r\nthe good luck to get off with a broken thigh. The five assistants, who\r\nworked the windlass and the telephone, also received shocks\r\ntransmitted through the metal wires of the cable. They fell\r\nunconscious, but were quickly restored. This phenomenon, which is\r\nexcessively rare, fittingly closes this odd collection of stories,\r\nfantastically illustrated by lightning.\r\n\r\nA communication from Berlin also mentions that the captive balloon of\r\nthe battalion of aeronauts was struck by lightning on the exercise\r\nground at Senne. Two under-officers and a private were wounded by the\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLIGHTNING CONDUCTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively recent times, as we have seen, all that was known\r\nabout thunderstorms was that they occurred pretty well all over the\r\nworld, and generally in either spring or summer.\r\n\r\nWhile efforts were being made on our old continent to establish by\r\nlong and ingenious dissertations the exact degrees of relationship\r\nbetween lightning and the sparks given out by machines, in America\r\npractical experiments were being set about towards solving the\r\nproblems of electricity.\r\n\r\nFranklin it was who hit upon the idea of extracting electricity from\r\nthe clouds for the purpose of investigation.\r\n\r\nThis man of immortal genius, who by his achievements in science, his\r\nnoble character, and his devotion to his country, has won the\r\nadmiration and gratitude of posterity, was of humble origin.\r\n\r\nThe son of a soap manufacturer in a small way of business, Benjamin\r\nFranklin was born at Boston in 1706. His parents had intended him to\r\ngo in for science. He was successively an apprentice to a candle\r\nmanufacturer, a journeyman printer, the head of a big printing firm in\r\nPhiladelphia, deputy to Congress, an ambassador, and finally President\r\nof the Assembly of the States of Pennsylvania. His political record\r\nwas a great one. No one ever rendered greater services to his country\r\nthan the diplomatist who signed the peace of 1783, and insured the\r\nindependence of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the age of forty that Franklin began his study of\r\nelectricity. Here is his own account of the memorable experiments to\r\nwhich he owed the greater part of his immense fame:--\r\n\r\n\"In 1746 I met at Boston a certain Dr. Spence, who came from Scotland.\r\nHe performed some electrical experiments before me. They were not very\r\nperfect, as he was not a man of great ability; but as the subject was\r\nnew to me they surprised me and interested me in an equal degree.\r\nShortly after my return to Philadelphia, our librarian received as a\r\ngift from Pierre Collinson, a member of the Royal Society of London, a\r\ntube of glass, together with certain written instructions as to the\r\nway in which it should be used for experiments. I seized eagerly on\r\nthe chance of reproducing what I had seen done at Boston, and with\r\npractice I acquired a great facility in performing the experiments\r\nindicated to us from England and in devising other ones. I say 'with\r\npractice,' because many people came to my house to witness these\r\nmarvels.\"\r\n\r\nAfter making several discoveries in regard to electricity, Franklin\r\ntook it into his head to extract the fluid direct from the clouds. He\r\nhad established the fact that a stem of pointed metal, placed at a\r\ngreat height--on the summit of a building, for instance--served as an\r\nattraction to lightning and guided it into the way prepared for it. He\r\nhad been looking eagerly to the erection of a clock-tower which was\r\nbeing built at this time at Philadelphia; but, tired of waiting and\r\nanxious to carry out experiments which should solve all doubts, he had\r\nrecourse to a more expeditious instrument, and one, as events proved,\r\nnot less efficacious, for getting into touch with the region of\r\nthunder--a kite such as children play with.\r\n\r\nHe prepared two sticks in the form of a cross, with a silk\r\nhandkerchief stretched upon them, and with a string attached of\r\nsuitable length, and set forth on his mission the first time there was\r\na storm. He was accompanied only by his son. Fearing the ridicule that\r\nis showered upon failure, he did not take any one else into his\r\nconfidence. The kite was set flying. A cloud which looked promising\r\npassed without result. Others followed, and the excitement with which\r\nthey were awaited can be imagined.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no spark and no sign of electricity. Presently some\r\nfilaments of the string began to move, as though they had been pushed\r\nout, and a slight rustling could be heard. Franklin now touched the\r\nend of the string with his finger, and instantly a spark was given\r\nout, followed quickly by others. Thus for the first time the genius of\r\nman may be said to have come to grips with lightning, and begun to\r\nlearn the secret of its existence.\r\n\r\nThis experiment took place in June, 1752, and made an immense\r\nsensation throughout the world, and was repeated in other countries,\r\nalways with the same success.\r\n\r\nA French magistrate, named de Romas, making use of Franklin's idea as\r\nsoon as it was known in France, took it into his head to use a kite\r\nwith raised cross-bars, and in June, 1753, before the full results of\r\nFranklin's experiments were made public, secured still more remarkable\r\nsigns of electricity, having inserted a thread of metal throughout the\r\nwhole length of the string, which was 260 metres. Later, in 1757, de\r\nRomas repeating his experiments during a storm, secured sparks of a\r\nsurprising size. \"Imagine before you,\" he said, \"lances of fire nine\r\nor ten feet in length and an inch thick, and making as much noise as\r\npistol shots. In less than an hour I had certainly thirty lances of\r\nthis length, without reckoning a thousand shorter ones of seven feet\r\nand under.\" Numbers of people, ladies among them, were present at\r\nthese experiments. They were not without danger, as may be imagined;\r\nde Romas was once knocked over by an unusually heavy discharge, but\r\nwithout being seriously hurt.\r\n\r\nFranklin was the first to turn his experiments to practical account,\r\nattaching lightning-conductors to public and private buildings for\r\ntheir protection, and achieving marvellous results; the lightning\r\nbeing caught by the metallic stem and following it obediently into the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, lightning-conductors came into almost universal use,\r\nand their value was not long in being generally recognized. Curiously\r\nenough, France, which had been ahead of all other countries in the\r\nstudy of electricity, was not one of the earliest to go in for\r\nlightning-conductors. There were, indeed, signs of strong hostility to\r\ntheir introduction. It was held even that they went against the\r\ndesigns of Providence. In 1766, the Abbé Poncelet, in his work\r\nentitled \"La Nature dans la formation du tonnerre et la reproduction\r\ndes êtres vivants,\" in which he sets out to demonstrate that the force\r\nwhich produces lightning is the same as that which causes the earth to\r\nfructify, makes a strong protest against the construction of\r\nlightning-conductors.\r\n\r\nIn 1782, nevertheless, at the reiterated request of Le Roi, a member\r\nof the Academie des Sciences, and friend and admirer of Franklin, the\r\nLouvre was endowed with the first lightning-conductor put up on a\r\npublic building in France. Soon afterwards they became common.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 the Academie des Sciences drew up the first set of rules for\r\nthe construction of lightning-conductors. It was revised and corrected\r\nin 1823, in accordance with the various improvements that had been\r\nintroduced up till then, and it has been further added to in 1854,\r\n1867, and 1903. These instructions point out that the most important\r\nmetallic portions of the building should be placed in communication\r\nwith the conductor, and this should sink into a well. Conductors that\r\nare not perfectly constructed are a source of danger, instead of being\r\na protection, for the electric current is apt, instead of running down\r\ninto the earth, to make for any kind of metallic substance, and cause\r\ngreat havoc.\r\n\r\nThe conductor ought really to communicate with a large body of\r\nwater--a body of water of greater extent than the storm cloud from\r\nwhich the lightning comes. When the flow is insufficient, the water\r\nitself is apt to become electrically charged. It is dangerous to bury\r\nthe conductor in merely damp soil; first, because one generally does\r\nnot know whether there is enough of this soil; secondly, because one\r\ncannot be sure that the humidity will be sufficient at times of great\r\ndrought--the very times when storms are most to be feared. Failing a\r\nriver or great pond, the conductor should be put into wells issuing or\r\nhaving their source in inexhaustible supplies of water deep down in\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nIn his table of statistics showing the number of cases in which\r\nlightning has struck either lightning-conductors, or buildings, or\r\nships furnished with conductors, Quebelet gives a hundred and\r\nsixty-eight cases in which the conductor has been struck, and in only\r\ntwenty-seven instances of these (one-sixth of the whole) have the\r\nconductors, from some grave flaw in their construction, failed to\r\nfulfil their office. These results are the best proof possible of the\r\nefficacy of conductors, and the best answer to those who decry them.\r\n\r\nThe area of protection covered by the conductor is not so great as is\r\ngenerally supposed. It is limited to a distance about three or four\r\ntimes the length of the conductor above the roof. Thus a conductor\r\nstanding out five yards will protect an area stretching only about\r\nfifteen or twenty yards away. This depends also to some extent upon\r\nthe nature of the place and the materials of which the house is\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nBuildings are often struck by lightning because the number of\r\nconductors has been insufficient for the extent of the edifice to be\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this defect, conductors are made with a number of separate\r\nstems--veritable wire traps in which to catch the lightning. This\r\nsystem, the invention of a Belgian physicist, M. Melsens, decreases\r\nconsiderably the risks of destruction, and is much more economical\r\nthan the erection of a number of separate conductors.\r\n\r\nA conductor of this kind has been installed on the Hotel de Ville at\r\nBrussels, which has been well protected from lightning ever since,\r\nwhereas previously this building had been struck by lightning several\r\ntimes in spite of the single conductors with which it was supplied.\r\nThe metallic trellis is in communication with the sewers.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter-houses of La Villette, the Hôtel Evigné, and other\r\nbuildings in Paris, are provided with similar defences.\r\n\r\nThe Eiffel Tower boasts several such multiplex conductors. It has\r\noften been struck by lightning, but no one who has happened to be up\r\nit at the time has ever suffered any damage therefrom. The lightning\r\nstrikes the conductor sometimes from out the actual cloud--curious\r\nphotographs have been taken of this. The Eiffel Tower is in itself a\r\ngigantic lightning-conductor.\r\n\r\nPortable conductors have been invented from time to time--silk\r\numbrellas without iron ribs, and clothes of indiarubber and\r\nsuch-like; but they have all been childish things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithout allowing one's self to get lightning, so to speak, on the\r\nbrain, it is well to take certain precautions during a storm.\r\n\r\nThe first and principal one is not to get under a tree.\r\n\r\nThe second is to give a wide berth to telegraph posts, so as to avoid\r\ncontact with the sparks that may issue from them.\r\n\r\nMovements of the air having the effect of preparing an excellent route\r\nfor the fluid, it is well not to run in a storm. It is well also not\r\nto ring a bell.\r\n\r\nIt is well, also, to avoid being in the neighbourhood of animals, in\r\nview of their attraction for lightning.\r\n\r\nIn houses, doors and windows should be closed in order to avoid\r\ndraughts. It is well to keep away from the chimney, too, as well as\r\nfrom metallic objects.\r\n\r\nBut lightning always has its caprices. It is this that makes its study\r\nso interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPICTURES MADE BY LIGHTNING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this last chapter I would like to group together a series of\r\ninstances of pictures made by lightning, some of them very curious and\r\nattributed, it would seem, to flashes of a special character, which we\r\nmay perhaps term Ceraunic Rays, from _Keraunos_, lightning. These\r\ninstances are of great variety, and doubtless admit of many different\r\nexplanations. Here, then, is a selection worth looking into.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as in so many others, it is extremely difficult to get\r\nat the exact truth.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it is from the newspapers that we get the\r\nfacts--more or less accurately observed, more or less accurately\r\nrecorded. I have made great efforts to inform myself personally as to\r\nthe incidents whenever this has been practicable.\r\n\r\nThe _Petit Marseillais_ of June 18, 1896, published the following:--\r\n\r\n\"A correspondent writes to us from Pertius, June 17:--\r\n\r\n\"'In the course of the storm here yesterday, two day-labourers of our\r\ntown, Jean Sasier and Joseph Elisson, took refuge in a cabin\r\nconstructed of reeds. They were standing at the entrance when they\r\nwere struck by lightning and thrown violently to the ground. Elisson,\r\nwho was not much hurt, soon recovered his senses and called for help.\r\nPeople ran up at once and carried the two men to where they live,\r\nwhere all necessary attention was given to them.\r\n\r\n\"'Sasier's condition, though serious enough by reason of a burn on his\r\nright side, is not causing anxiety. The curious part of the incident\r\nis the effect the electric fluid has produced upon Elisson. The\r\nlightning cut open one of his boots and tore his trousers; but over\r\nand above this, like a tattooer making use of photography, _it\r\nreproduced admirably_ on the artisan's body a representation of a pine\r\ntree, of a poplar, and of the handle of his watch. It is an undoubted\r\ncase of photography through opaque materials; most luckily the\r\nsensitive plate--Elisson's body--merely took the impression and\r\nreceived no injury.'\"\r\n\r\nOn reading this narrative, I wrote to the Mayor of the Commune of\r\nPertius to ask him for confirmation of it, and for a photograph, if\r\npossible, of the picture on Elisson's body. By a fortunate\r\ncircumstance, the Mayor happened to be the doctor who had attended the\r\nvictim. Here is his reply:--\r\n\r\n     \"M. Joseph Elisson, of Pertius, aged about thirty-eight, was\r\n     struck by lightning on June 17. Called to attend to him at\r\n     about two in the afternoon, I found some superficial burns\r\n     forming a trail, which began near the teat of his left\r\n     breast, at the level of his waistcoat pocket, in which there\r\n     was a watch (which had not stopped), and went down towards\r\n     the navel, then turned boldly to the right towards the iliac\r\n     spine and down the outer side of his right leg as far as the\r\n     ankle, at the level of which his boot, made of strong\r\n     leather, had been split open.\r\n\r\n     \"To the right, a little outside the vertical line passing the\r\n     teat, there was imprinted in vivid red--the red of the\r\n     burn--a picture of a tree. The foot of it was on a level with\r\n     the edge of the ribs, the top went slightly above the teat.\r\n     This picture was absolutely vertical. Its outlines stood out\r\n     very distinctly from the white skin. It was composed of bold,\r\n     clearly defined lines, about a demimillimetre in width.\r\n     Neither waistcoat nor shirt were burnt or marked in any way\r\n     to correspond with it. Other representations of tree branches\r\n     were reproduced higher up on the breast, but not so\r\n     distinctly in the midst of a uniform redness. Not having by\r\n     me my camera, I made a sketch of the tree, which was\r\n     marvellously distinct, leaving the taking of a photograph\r\n     until next day. Next day, when I returned with my camera, the\r\n     picture was still clearly visible, but it had faded a good\r\n     deal, lost in the colour of the skin, and no longer to be\r\n     reproduced by photography. I regretted bitterly not having\r\n     taken it the day before. I regret this all the more now that\r\n     you have done me the honour of writing to me on the subject,\r\n     and I am glad to be able to send you my sketch of the\r\n     picture, which is correct as to dimensions, and which\r\n     represents what I saw as accurately as I could make it.\r\n\r\n                \"DR. G. TOURNATOIRE.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a facsimile of the sketch enclosed by the doctor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat like the shape of a poplar. There is nothing to suggest\r\nthat we have here a case of swollen veins, or arteries made\r\nconspicuous by a flow of blood, nor of a tree-like form due to blood\r\nvessels, in which the blood has taken on a more or less marked aspect.\r\nOn the other hand, it is certainly not much easier to recognize in it\r\na photograph of a more or less distant tree. In this state of\r\nuncertainty on the subject, I wrote again to Dr. Tournatoire, and\r\nbegged of him to go to the scene of the incident and to make a plan of\r\nthe ground, and take a photograph of the view. Here is the doctor's\r\nreply:--\r\n\r\n\"This plan can be reproduced by a few typographical lines in such a\r\nway as to show clearly how things happened--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"The square represents the cabin in which the two workmen took refuge.\r\nThey were sitting almost opposite each other on the seats marked A and\r\nB. There is a flash of lightning. One of the men is knocked over, and\r\nbears on his right side a picture of the poplar P, which stands one\r\nhundred metres away, and is visible by A through the door O, of which\r\nthe width is one metre. Behind this poplar stands a big pine, a branch\r\nof which is also depicted on the man's body. By this same stroke of\r\nlightning the other worker, seated at B, is thrown out of the cabin\r\nthree metres by an opening D, about forty centimetres wide. The two\r\nmen are alive, and have come out of it with a few days' rest. They saw\r\nnothing, heard nothing, and can remember nothing.\"\r\n\r\nIn the photographs taken by Dr. Tournatoire it is not clear which is\r\nthe tree, for the poplar, P, does not stand out alone. As the cabin\r\nstands under the shade of a pine tree, one is disposed to ask whether\r\nthe lightning did not strike this pine? But judging by the position of\r\nthe trees relatively to the man struck, the most likely hypothesis is\r\nthat the electric discharge came from the point P towards A, and that\r\nthe poplar as well as the adjacent pine formed a sort of screen, and\r\nreproduced their reflection by the agency of some unknown constituent\r\nof these Ceraunic Rays, which enable them to photograph things in this\r\nway through clothes on to the human body.\r\n\r\nThis assuredly is a more extraordinary effect than those obtained by\r\nthe cathodic rays or anti-cathodic rays, of which science seems\r\nequally unable to give any explanation.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed with our studies. It is important above all never to\r\ntake the newspaper narratives on trust without verification. In the\r\nmonth of June, 1897, the following appeared in the newspapers:--\r\n\r\n\"PHOTOGRAPHIC LIGHTNING.--A _chasseur_ of the 15th battalion, in\r\nbarracks at Remiremont, was struck by lightning. He was standing upon\r\na mound not far from a grove of pines, in the midst of ferns. Curious\r\nto relate, on the occasion of recording the fact of the man's being\r\ndead, it was discovered that his body was covered with punctures\r\nimprinted on it by the lightning, and representing the nature and\r\naspect of the branches and plants all round him at the time when he\r\nwas struck.\"\r\n\r\nI wrote at once to the _chef de bataillon_ for a precise confirmation\r\nof this, and received the following reply:--\r\n\r\n     \"M. le Commandant Joppé, commanding officer of the 15th\r\n     Battalion of Chasseurs, has handed me your letter of June\r\n     14th, and asked me to reply to it.\r\n\r\n     \"It is the case that a _chasseur_ of the battalion was struck\r\n     by lightning on the afternoon of June 4, but it is quite\r\n     untrue that there was found on his body a photograph of the\r\n     trees adjoining the spot of the accident. The man's clothes\r\n     were not affected in any way, and the only traces left by the\r\n     passage of the lightning, consisted in some slight\r\n     irregularly shaped burns on the upper part of the hollow of\r\n     the right temple of linear formation, save for one circular\r\n     burn measuring from three to four millimetres in diameter,\r\n     and depressing the skin into the shape of a saucer. There was\r\n     no lesion on the whole surface of the body.\r\n\r\n                \"MAUNY,\r\n                \"Surgeon-Major 15th Battalion of Chasseurs.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply was covered by a note which ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I thought it desirable that the reply to your letter of the\r\n     14th inst. should be made by the surgeon-major of my\r\n     battalion in order that it might be the more scientifically\r\n     accurate and authoritative.\r\n\r\n                \"JOPPÉ,\r\n                \"Chef de bataillon breveté,\r\n                \"Commanding Officer of the 15th Battalion of the\r\n                    Chasseurs des Vosges.\"\r\n\r\nClearly, the student of natural phenomena cannot take too many\r\nprecautions. And yet ... an officer of high rank confided to me\r\nrecently that \"surgeon-majors hardly ever take the trouble to examine\r\nbodies thoroughly,\" and that it is possible that in this case \"the\r\nexamination may have been very superficial.\" If this be a general\r\nrule, there must have been an exception here, as also in the fifth\r\ncase, to which we shall be coming just now.\r\n\r\nThe problem is far from being solved, and we can but seek to study it\r\nas set forth in a number of instances. Here is a third case:--\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, August 23, 1903, a certain number of riflemen were\r\npractising at the Charbonnières range, near the village of Le Pont, in\r\nthe valley of Lalle Joux (Canton de Vaud, Suisse), five targets out of\r\nsix were in use. The targets, distant 300 metres from the firing-line,\r\nare placed to the side of a grove of pines. Between stretches an\r\nundulating rock-strewn meadow-land. Only the butts are provided with a\r\nlightning-conductor, and in it are five markers. _There are six\r\ntelephone wires along the line of fire_; they come as far as the stand\r\nand go down to within about 50 centimetres of the scorers' seats.\r\n_Each target has its own telephone bell._\r\n\r\nThe weather was not stormy, though the sky was somewhat overcast.\r\nFiring was going on. At about 3.30 there was a clap of thunder, and\r\nlightning struck the electric wires. In the stand twenty-eight men,\r\nriflemen, scorers, and spectators, are thrown to the ground in every\r\ndirection and in every position. Some are quite inert, apparently\r\ndead; others, looking as though they were asphyxiated, give out a\r\npainful rattling noise from their throats. At the bar, to the side of\r\nthe stand, no one felt anything--it was not even noticed that there\r\nhad been a violent stroke of lightning. A kilometre away the band,\r\nwhich had been giving a concert in front of the Hotel de la Triute on\r\nthe bridge, continued to play. Presently a man reaches them with the\r\nreport that twenty of the riflemen have been killed. Consternation\r\nbecomes general, and relief parties are organized. Fortunately the\r\ndamage done was much less than was supposed.\r\n\r\nLet us describe the men actually engaged in firing, and placed in a\r\nline, A, B, C, D, and E, their scorers are behind them.\r\n\r\nLet us give our attention, first, to these men and their scorers.\r\nPresently we shall come to the others awaiting their turn, then to\r\nthe spectators, and finally to the markers at the targets.\r\n\r\nThe men were firing, either kneeling or lying.\r\n\r\nA remained in position, kneeling \"like a statue,\" unable to move. He\r\nturned right over as soon as he was touched. Killed.\r\n\r\nB had _a pine tree depicted on his breast_--upside down, its roots\r\nindicated by some outlines up at the top; the picture was of a\r\nbrownish rather than a blueish shade. It was suggested that it\r\nresembled a pine, because of a pine being ten metres away from the\r\nstand, but really it was more like a branch of fern. Killed.\r\n\r\nC felt hardly anything apart from a certain heaviness in his limbs\r\nwhen picking himself up.\r\n\r\nD had some slight burns, which were healed within two or three days.\r\n\r\nE was holding his rifle with the barrel vertically. He found himself\r\nabout 2-1/2 metres from his position on the ground, with a stone in\r\nhis hands; his rifle had been bent in two below the trigger.\r\n\r\nA's scorer held the pear-shaped handle of the electric bell between\r\nhis fingers, his elbows upon the table. Saw nothing, heard nothing.\r\nFelt himself suddenly bent up double, his face buried in the gravel;\r\nlost consciousness while he was being carried away; when he came to\r\nhimself again he began to ramble in his speech; his pencil was broken\r\nlengthwise into four pieces. The wire of his bell had been\r\nelectrified. By way of wound, he had a picture of a pine branch on his\r\nback; water issued from it as from a blister; there were no traces of\r\nblood. The picture disappeared at the end of two days. For a certain\r\ntime the young man had a pain in his loins; he still limps somewhat;\r\nprobably what he now suffers from is sciatic lumbago, the result of\r\npartial and temporary paralysis.\r\n\r\nB's scorer had only some insignificant burns.\r\n\r\nC's scorer only came to himself twenty minutes later as the result of\r\nartificial respiration. At the moment of the lightning he was pressing\r\nthe electric button with his thumb in order to give the signal,\r\n\"Change the target;\" he had a small hole in his thumb. This burn bled\r\nlater, and the wound took four weeks to heal. He had also some burns\r\non his legs.\r\n\r\nD's scorer was holding the handle of the bell against his left cheek,\r\non a level with his eye. The handle, made of wood, burst. The sight of\r\nhis left eye is still affected, being very weak--the retina was\r\nprobably torn away. The day after the accident, the young man's face\r\nbecame all inflamed, especially the part round the eyes. These were\r\nquite hidden. This inflammation, of a bluish tint, is due to the\r\ndilation of the small veins or of the capillaries.\r\n\r\nDr. Yersin, who attended several of the victims, attributes this\r\ndilation to a paralysis of the vasomotor nerves, \"_which would also\r\nexplain the tree-like form of the pictures seen upon the skin_,\" and\r\nthe transudation (?) of water across the small blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nE's scorer had time to see the men on his left fall, in a green or\r\nviolet light. He had heard a general death-rattle-like chorus,\r\n\"Aôôô\"--then, before he could make out what was happening, he found\r\nhimself driven up against the wall of the stand. He had a wound under\r\nhis feet; his thumb torn also, probably in trying to hold himself up\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\nBehind the scorers were a dozen other riflemen and some spectators. To\r\nthe left the electric current left intact the rifles standing on the\r\nrack. Quite near this, a man awaiting his turn fell, clinging on to\r\nthe neck of one of his comrades, also struck. Later he found his purse\r\nin the middle of the stand.\r\n\r\nIn the case of several of the spectators, the burns were to be found\r\nin separate sores. One had his hair burnt on one spot of about the\r\nsize of a five franc piece; others, who had burns upon their feet and\r\nlegs, are under the impression they saw a small blue flame at the tips\r\nof their shoes.\r\n\r\nThe general feeling was at first merely that of stupefaction. Terror\r\ndid not come until afterwards. \"Those who did not lose all\r\nconsciousness were half stunned.\" A young boy was noticed jammed up\r\nagainst the wall, incapable of moving, but bewailing his inability to\r\nget to his father, who lay dead upon the ground. Two men took flight\r\nwithout throwing aside their guns; another ran as far as the village,\r\nand some hours afterwards he was found asleep in a house \"to which\r\nthere was nothing to take him.\" One young spectator, a stranger to the\r\nneighbourhood, was seized with a partial paralysis of the brain; he\r\ncould not keep his balance when walking, and when questioned he would\r\nrecite the names of stations on a Swiss railway. He is better now.\r\n\r\nThis event will not be soon forgotten in the Joux valley. But Dr.\r\nYersin's explanation of the Ceraunic pictures does not seem to me to\r\nbe justified.\r\n\r\nHere is a fourth instance, given me long ago by one of the most\r\nlearned physicists of last century, Hoin, of the Institute.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to tell you,\" he wrote to me in July, 1866, \"of a stroke\r\nof lightning which was very curious in its effects. It occurred at\r\nmidday on June 27, at Bergheim, a village situated to the north of\r\nLogelbach at the foot of the Vosges. It struck two travellers who had\r\ntaken refuge under the tree and knocked them over senseless--one of\r\nthem was lifted to a height of more than a yard and thrown upon his\r\nback. It was thought they must be dead, but thanks to the attention\r\ngiven to them at once, they were brought to themselves, and they are\r\nnow out of danger. But here is the strange feature of the accident.\r\nBoth travellers have on their backs, extending down to their thighs,\r\n_the imprint, as though by photography, of the leaves of a lime tree_;\r\naccording to the statement of the Mayor, M. Radat, _the most skilful\r\ndraughtsman could not have done it better_.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a fifth instance which I find among my records. The incident\r\nhappened at Chambéry, May 29, 1868.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a violent storm, a soldier of the 47th Regiment was\r\nstruck by lightning underneath a chestnut tree. In a memorandum drawn\r\nup on June 18 by a learned doctor of Chambéry, an eyewitness of the\r\noccurrence, the following facts are recorded:--\r\n\r\n\"The man who was killed had been standing in the centre of a group of\r\neight soldiers, who had their guns in their hands, without bayonets.\r\nStruck in the region of the heart, he did not succumb for about a\r\nquarter of an hour, after saying a few words. The corpse bore an oval\r\nplate, so to speak, of about 13 to 14 centimetres in length, by 4 to 5\r\nin width, occupying largely the precordial region, and presenting the\r\nparchment-like aspect of a vesicatory that had become rapidly dried\r\nup. The clothes were neither torn nor burnt.\r\n\r\n\"Two hours after his death an examination of the body resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of a phenomenon already recorded by several observers--the\r\nreproduction of photo-electric pictures.\r\n\r\n\"On the right shoulder were three bunches of leaves of a more or less\r\ndeep reddish violet hue, reproduced minutely with the most absolute\r\nphotographic precision. The first, situated on the lower part of the\r\ninside of the forearm, represented a long branch of leaves like those\r\nof a chestnut tree; the second, which seemed to be formed by two or\r\nthree such branches twisted together, was in the middle of the outside\r\nof the arm; and the third, in the middle of the shoulder, larger and\r\nrounder, showed only some leaves and small branches at the top and at\r\nthe borders, the centre presenting a red stain diminishing towards the\r\ncircumference. The body, when dissected, bore no sign of any interior\r\nlesion.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a sixth instance:--\r\n\r\nIn June, 1869, a Trappist was struck by lightning at the monastery of\r\nScourmant, near Chimay in Belgium. It was the afternoon, and the monks\r\nwere busy mowing. The storm coming along obliged them to seek shelter.\r\nOne of them, who was following the mowing machine worked by two\r\nhorses, directed it towards an ironwork enclosure, and knelt down\r\nbeside this trellis. There was a terrible thunderclap, the horses\r\nbolted in their fright, and the monk remained with his face to the\r\nground. The others, who saw him fall, ran up to his assistance, only\r\nto find him dead. The medical attendant of the monastery, sent for at\r\nonce, discovered on the body two large and deep burns, identical in\r\nshape, and placed symmetrically to each side of the breast; he pointed\r\nout also to those who were present a white spot under the left armpit,\r\n_presenting a very distinct picture of the trunk of a tree with\r\nbranches on it_.\r\n\r\nOut of these six cases, five may be taken as fully authenticated.\r\n\r\nDr. Lebigne, Mayor of Nibelle (Loiret), published the following\r\nnarrative in the _Moniteur_ of September 7, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday, September 4, 1864, at about 10.30 a.m., three men were\r\nbusy gathering pears about 200 metres out of Nibelle, when the pear\r\ntree was struck by lightning, and was distorted from top to bottom in\r\nthe form of a screw; the lightning carried away the bark and about a\r\ncentimetre of the wood beneath; then quitting the tree, it struck the\r\nhead of one of the workmen, who was eating some bread at the time, and\r\nkilled him, as well as a dog by his side. The head was burnt behind\r\nfrom top to bottom and was impregnated with a strong smell of sulphur.\r\n\r\n\"The two other workmen who were on the tree were thrown to the ground,\r\nand remained for some time senseless. When they came to themselves\r\nthey could not move their legs. They were taken to their homes, and it\r\nwas found that both had been in contact with the electric fluid. The\r\nastonishing thing about them is, that _one of them had the branches\r\nand leaves of the pear tree clearly imprinted on his breast as though\r\nby daguerreotype_. The terrible photographer had been merciful,\r\nhowever, for that evening both the men were up again and able to\r\nwalk.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Comptes rendus_ of the Academie des Sciences for the year 1843\r\n(xvi. p. 1328) records that in July, 1841, in the department of\r\nIndre-et-Loire, a magistrate and a miller's boy were struck by\r\nlightning in the vicinity of a poplar. It was found that both of them\r\nhad on their breasts stains exactly like the leaves of a poplar. These\r\nmarks, in the case of the magistrate, went away gradually as the blood\r\nbegan to circulate again. In the case of the boy, who was killed on\r\nthe spot, they had faded somewhat by the day after, when decomposition\r\nhad begun to set in.\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of this case, very similar to those preceding, Arago\r\nrecalled the fact that in 1786 Leroy, a member of the Academie des\r\nSciences, declared that Franklin had several times told him how a man\r\nwho was standing at a door during a storm had seen a tree struck by\r\nlightning opposite him, and that a representation of this tree was\r\nfound imprinted upon his breast. Arago recalled, too, in this\r\nconnection a report made to the old Academy in August 2, 1786, by\r\nBossuet and Leroy, in which there was question of a man killed by\r\nlightning on May 10, 1585, in the Collegiate School of Riom in\r\nAuvergne; in this case the electric fluid had entered by the heel and\r\ngone out by the head, leaving on the body singular marks, described in\r\nthe report. It was thought that the lightning on its way, through\r\nhaving forced the blood into all the vessels in the skin, must have\r\nmade all the ramifications of these vessels sensitive to impressions\r\nfrom without. Extraordinary though this may appear, they go on to say,\r\nit is not new; Père Beccaria cites a similar case; and Franklin's case\r\nis cited here also as analogous. Besile, the author of the record of\r\nthe Riom case, \"did not hesitate,\" he tells us, \"to attribute the\r\neffect to an eruption of the blood in the vessels of the skin,\r\nproducing a result similar to that of an injection.\" The statement in\r\nthe _Comptes rendus_ is entitled \"Strange appearance of Ecchymoses\r\nformed by lightning upon the skin of two persons.\"\r\n\r\nThat is just the question. Was there in these pictures nothing but\r\necchymoses--infiltrations of the blood into the cellular tissue?\r\nPerhaps that may be so in some cases, but not in all. Photography, the\r\nphoto-electric pictures produced in the laboratories of physicists,\r\nMoses's _figures_(?), the Lichtenberg flowers, cathodic rays, Rontgen\r\nrays, radiography-all these things open new horizons for us. And even\r\nif we do not find any explanation satisfactory, we should not be\r\njustified in accepting the first offered to us as being so, if in fact\r\nit be not.\r\n\r\nHere are four interesting cases recorded by Poey in his \"Rélation\r\nHistorique des images photo-electriques de la foudre.\"\r\n\r\nMme. Morosa, of Lugano, seated near a window during a storm,\r\nexperienced a shock from which she is not stated to have suffered any\r\nill effects; but a flower, which had stood in the route of the\r\nelectric current, was found perfectly _drawn_ on her leg, and this\r\npicture lasted the rest of her days.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1853, a young girl in the United States of America was\r\nstanding at a window facing a nut tree at the moment of a dazzling\r\nflash of lightning; a complete picture of the tree was reproduced on\r\nher body.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1857, a peasant woman of Seine-et-Marne, who was minding\r\na cow, was struck by lightning under a tree. The cow was killed, and\r\nthe woman was thrown on the ground insensible. She was, however, soon\r\nrevived. In loosening her clothes to attend to her, the people who\r\ncame to her assistance found perfectly reproduced on her breast _a\r\npicture of the cow_.\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1860, a mill at Lappion (Aisne), belonging to M.\r\nCarlier, was struck by lightning. On the back of a woman of\r\nforty-four, who was also struck, the lightning left a reproduction (of\r\na reddish hue) of a tree--_trunk_, _branches_, _foliage_, _and all_.\r\nHer clothes bore no trace of the passage of the lightning.\r\n\r\nUnless we are to suppose that all these have been inaccurately\r\nobserved, it seems to me that we must admit that there is something\r\nelse besides ecchymoses, something else besides the workings of veins\r\nand arteries in these pictures wrought by lightning.\r\n\r\nCertain of these tree-like pictures resemble the patterns we get in\r\nphotographing electrical discharges upon sensitized plates. Might they\r\nnot be produced by this discharge upon the surface of the body--or by\r\nthe emission of electricity from the body struck?\r\n\r\nThe pictures we shall now hear of, to be distinguished from those\r\nalready dealt with, are easier to explain, and about their genuineness\r\nthere can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1865, a doctor from the neighbourhood of Vienna, Dr.\r\nDerendinger, was returning home by train. On getting out at the\r\nstation he found that he had not got his purse on him--some one\r\nprobably had stolen it.\r\n\r\nThis purse was made of tortoise-shell, and had on one side of it a\r\nsteel plate marked with the doctor's monogram--two D's intermingled.\r\n\r\nSome time after, the doctor was called to attend to a stranger who\r\nhad been found lying insensible under a tree, having been struck by\r\nlightning. The first thing that he noticed on examining the man's body\r\nwas that on his thigh there was a reproduction, as though by\r\nphotography, of his own monogram. His astonishment may be imagined. He\r\nsucceeded in reviving the stranger, who was taken to a hospital. The\r\ndoctor remarked that in his clothes his lost tortoise-shell purse\r\nwould probably be found. So it proved. The individual struck by\r\nlightning was the thief. The electric fluid had been attracted by the\r\nsteel plate, and had imprinted the monogram upon the man's body.\r\n\r\nIn this case we are set thinking of electro-metallurgy, all the more\r\nbecause there are a number of other instances which certainly belong\r\nto this category. Thus, for instance, on July 25, 1868, at Nantes, a\r\nstranger near the Pont de l'Erdre, on the Quai Flesselles, was\r\nenveloped by a flash of lightning, but proceeded on his way without\r\nexperiencing any ill effects. He had on him a purse containing two\r\npieces of silver in one compartment and a ten-franc piece in gold in\r\nanother. On taking out his purse he found that a coating of silver\r\ntaken from one of the silver pieces--a franc--had been transferred to\r\nboth sides of the ten-franc piece. The franc, slightly thinner,\r\nespecially over the moustache of Napoleon III., was in parts slightly\r\nbluish. This transference of the silver on to gold was made through\r\nthe skin of the partition of the compartments![1]\r\n\r\nAnother case. In Gilbert's \"Annalen der Physik\" (1817) we read that a\r\nflash of lightning struck the tower of a chapel near Dresden and took\r\nthe gilt off the framework of the clock and transferred it to the\r\nleaden runs of the window-panes in such a way as to leave no sign of\r\nhow these had been gilded.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the analogy with galvano electro-metallurgy is evident.\r\nBut in the earlier cases this was not so; the trees contained no\r\nmetallic element. It was not a case of transference. They seem to have\r\nbeen photographed by the ceraunic rays.\r\n\r\nOn October 9, 1836, a young man was killed by lightning. The corpse\r\nbore in the middle of the right shoulder six rings of flesh-colour,\r\nwhich seemed the more distinct in that the rest of the man's own skin\r\nwas very dark. These rings, overlapping each other, were of different\r\nsizes, corresponding exactly with those of the gold coins which he had\r\non him on the right side of his belt, as the public official who\r\nexamined his body and all the witnesses were able to testify.\r\n\r\nThis makes us think of radiography.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of Poey, the astronomer, told him that he had known a\r\nTrinidad lady who had been struck by lightning in her youth and on\r\nwhose stomach the lightning had imprinted a metallic comb which she\r\ncarried in her apron.\r\n\r\nIn these instances there was some kind of contact of the objects with\r\nthe persons struck. Here are others in which the objects reproduced\r\nare further removed, but still of metallic substance and still\r\nreminding us therefore of electro-metallurgy.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1825, the brigantine _Le Buon-Servo_, at anchor in the\r\nBay of Armiro, was struck by lightning. A sailor seated at the foot of\r\nthe mizzen-mast was killed. On his back was found a light yellow and\r\nblack mark, beginning at his neck and going down to his loins, where\r\nthere was discovered an exact reproduction, in facsimile, of a\r\nhorseshoe nailed to the mast.\r\n\r\nThe mizzen-mast of another brigantine was struck by lightning in the\r\nroadstead of Zaube. Under the left breast of a sailor who was killed\r\nwas found imprinted the number 44, which his mates all declared was\r\nnot there before. These two figures, large and well formed, with a\r\nfull stop between them, were identical with the same numbers in metal\r\naffixed to the rigging of the ship, and placed between the mast and\r\nthe sailor's bunk, in which he was lying asleep when struck.\r\n\r\nMay it not have been a tattoo-mark in spite of what his companions\r\ndeclared?\r\n\r\nM. José Maria Dau, of Havana, records that in 1838, in the province of\r\nCandaleria, in Cuba, there was found on the right ear and on the right\r\nside of the neck of a young man struck by lightning, the reproduction\r\nof a horseshoe, which had been nailed up at a short distance from him\r\nagainst a window.\r\n\r\nThese various records lead us to the reflection: first, that\r\nceraunography should form a new branch of physics, well meriting\r\nstudy; secondly, that the facts set forth are sufficiently inverse in\r\ntheir nature to show us that we have before us several quite distinct\r\nspecimens of phenomena.\r\n\r\nHowever, these matters have been a subject for study long before our\r\nday.\r\n\r\nA priest, P. Lamy, of the Congregation of Saint Maur, published in\r\n1696 an excellent little work,[2] informed by the most lucid common\r\nsense upon the curious effects of lightning--then a text for the most\r\nsuperstitious commentaries. Voltaire could not have reasoned the thing\r\nout better. He deals with two very extraordinary cases among others.\r\n\r\nThe first had for scene the Abbey of Saint Médard, at Soissons, on\r\nApril 26, 1676. A flash of lightning struck the tower of the abbey,\r\nwent into the clock, penetrated a wall eight feet thick, by a hole\r\nconducting an iron rod _à l'aiguille de cadran_, detached two planks,\r\nfour feet high, and threw them to the extreme end of the dormitory,\r\nfollowed a brass wire stretched along the whole length of the wall,\r\nsetting fire to it and spreading it out like a ribbon painted to\r\nrepresent a furrow of flames. Here is the author's own description:--\r\n\r\n\"The most surprising effect, and one which has aroused the curiosity\r\nof an immense number of people, is a kind of frieze of all kinds of\r\ncolours extending along the wall of the dormitory and just above the\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\n\"The depth of this frieze is about two feet; its length is almost\r\nequal to that of the dormitory; the designs upon it are of flames\r\ndarting up and down from a kind of wide band which occupies the centre\r\nof the frieze throughout its length.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a portion of this frieze copied, so as to give the reader\r\nan idea of it, but it must be admitted that it is difficult to suggest\r\nthe variety of _nuances_ in the original. Some people declare that in\r\nthe midst of all the colours in the flames, faces of men may be\r\ndescried as well as of marmosets and demons; but those who are less\r\nrichly endowed with imagination can see nothing of all this.\"\r\n\r\nOn p. 274 is a copy of the design by P. Lamy.\r\n\r\nAt this period, physicists were of the belief that lightning was \"an\r\nexhalation of nitre and sulphur,\" acting something after the fashion\r\nof powder, and able to burn up or throw over everything encountered on\r\nits route. In this girdle traced by the lightning, the author sees a\r\nscattering of all the constituents of the brass wire, transformed into\r\nall kinds of colours due to the dilation of the copper, melted and\r\nvaporized over the width of two feet, the colours, in which yellow\r\npredominates, varying according to the thickness and the inequalities\r\nof the \"projection.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second case examined into by P. Lamy, was that of what happened in\r\nthe church of Sauveur at Lagny, when it was struck by lightning on\r\nJuly 18, 1689. This is one of the most astounding in the entire\r\nhistory of the subject. Let us see what our author has to tell us:--\r\n\r\n\"If we were to look for some excuse for the strangeness and diversity\r\nof the people's sayings and doings in connection with the Lagny case\r\nof lightning, we should assuredly find it in the extraordinary nature\r\nof the case itself.\r\n\r\n\"For what would naturally be the effect upon minds accustomed to see\r\nmysteries in the most transparently natural events, minds whose\r\nphilosophy never goes beyond the senses, when they learn--\r\n\r\n\"1. That the lightning had not only descended upon the clock-tower of\r\nthe church, and carried off the slates from its roof, but had struck\r\nand overthrown nearly fifty persons inside the edifice, and wrought\r\ngreat havoc on the high altar.\r\n\r\n\"2. That it knocked over and broke the pedestal on which the figure of\r\nChrist was raised to the level of the altar-screen, though this figure\r\nremained miraculously suspended in the same place--for this is what is\r\nreported.\r\n\r\n\"3. That it carried off the curtain covering the panels of the altar\r\nand threw it to the ground without breaking or melting any of its\r\nrings, which were made only of copper, and without displacing the rod\r\nabove the ring-bolts on which they hung.\r\n\r\n\"4. That it upset the oil-lamp burning before the high altar.\r\n\r\n\"5. That it broke into two pieces the stone upon which the priest\r\nconsecrates the Host.\r\n\r\n\"6. That it tore into four pieces the card on which the canon of the\r\nMass was printed.\r\n\r\n\"7. That it tore the altar-cloth and the cloth which was over it--both\r\nof them in an extraordinary way, namely, in the form of a cross of St.\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\n\"8. That the high altar was seen to be burning.\r\n\r\n\"9. That it burnt a part of the communion-cloth and of the tabernacle,\r\nupon which it formed several black waves.\r\n\r\n\"10. Finally that it imprinted upon the altar-cloth the sacred words\r\nof the consecration, beginning with _Qui pridie quam pateretur_, and\r\ngoing down to _Hæc quotiescumque feceretis in mei memoriam facietis_,\r\ninclusive; only omitting those which are usually set forth in special\r\ncharacters, namely, _Hoc est Corpus meum_; _et Hic est Sanguis meus_.\r\n\r\n\"What, I repeat, can you expect unphilosophical minds to make of so\r\nastonishing an affair as this? How account for the choice, the\r\ndiscernment, and the mysterious preference for some words over others.\r\nWhich shall we consider the privileged words--those taken or those\r\nleft? What is one to think of the extraordinary way in which the\r\nfigure of the Saviour was left hanging? And of that strange imprint of\r\nthe cross? How resist all the thousand delusions and uncertainties and\r\nfears the entire thing calls forth?\r\n\r\n\"I wonder whether the unfortunate Balthasar, when his eyes beheld the\r\nterrible sight of the unknown hand inscribing upon the walls of his\r\nbanqueting-room the announcement of his doom, can have been a prey to\r\na greater variety of fears and tremors than those who witnessed or who\r\neven heard of the effects of the lightning at Lagny. For no doubt was\r\nfelt that they were the outcome of supernatural forces--spirits alone\r\ncould have worked these marvels; it was a question only whether they\r\nwere the work of evil spirits or good. Some believed them to be the\r\nwork of good spirits, deducing this from the omission of the words,\r\n_Hoc est Corpus_, etc., which they set down to a spirit of reverence\r\nfor the sacred mystery.\r\n\r\n\"Others believed them to be the work of evil spirits, but here again\r\nthere were different theories. Some held that bad spirits had\r\nperpetrated these things out of sheer wickedness, wilfully profaning\r\nthe holy objects and suppressing out of contempt, or some other evil\r\ndesign, the words so essential to the mystery; others held that mere\r\nimps had been at work, actuated more by mischief than sinfulness, and\r\nwishing only to give amusement to themselves and others by the\r\nquaintness of their pranks. I myself do not share any of those\r\ntheories.\"\r\n\r\nLamy's narrative proceeds to an examination of all the effects\r\nrecorded, which he explains in the simplest way in the world, without\r\nhaving to have recourse to any occult causes. He comes, finally, to\r\nthe last of all and the most extraordinary.\r\n\r\n\"Not wishing to put trust in anything but my own eyes, I went to the\r\nchurch myself, and the effects of the lightning I saw there repaid me\r\nfor the trouble.\r\n\r\n\"I examined carefully the new imprint on the cloth. I found it very\r\nclear and fine, the letters well finished, but the ink a little\r\nindistinct, perhaps I should say faded. As M. le Curé de Saint-Sauveur\r\n(who was kind enough to show me everything) assured me that at the\r\nmoment of the lightning the three-leaved card which contains the canon\r\nof the Mass lay between the altar-cloth and the small mat upon the\r\nstone on which the consecration takes place, folded in such a way that\r\nthe printed side was next to the altar-cloth, I compared the\r\ncharacters printed by the lightning with the original lettering, and\r\nfound that they corresponded exactly, except that they went from right\r\nto left, backwards, so that they had to be read with the help of a\r\nmirror, or else through the cloth from behind.\r\n\r\n\"I observed that the words which the lightning had not printed on the\r\ncloth, but had omitted, were done in red letters on the card, and were\r\nno more favoured nor ill-used than certain other marks without any\r\nsignificance also printed in red upon the card, and leaving no trace\r\nupon the altar-cloth.\"\r\n\r\nThe author proceeds to explain the so-called mystery, ascribing it to\r\nthe difference between the two inks--the thick black ink and the thin\r\nred ink. He examines also into the other phenomena, explaining them\r\nin the same way, like the sagacious and enlightened observer he was.\r\nIt is clear, then, that the study of the phenomena of lightning is no\r\nnew thing, and that it has been followed conscientiously for many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the canon of the Mass printed by the lightning at\r\nLagny, the reproduction was by contact and pressure--it was not a case\r\nof reproducing distant objects as though by photography. Here is\r\nanother case hardly less remarkable. The narrative is from the pen of\r\nIsaac Casaubon, in his _Adversaria_:--\r\n\r\n\"On a summer's day, about 1595, while divine service was in progress\r\nin the Cathedral at Wells, two or three thunderclaps were heard, of so\r\nterrible a nature that the whole congregation threw themselves down on\r\nthe ground. Lightning followed at once, but no one was hurt. The\r\nastonishing thing about the affair lies in the fact that crosses were\r\nafterwards found to have been imprinted upon the bodies of some of\r\nthose present at the service. The Bishop of Wells assured the Bishop\r\nof Ely that his wife told him she had a cross thus imprinted upon her;\r\nand that on his being incredulous, she had shown it to him, and that\r\nhe himself found afterwards that he, too, was thus adorned--on his\r\narm, if I remember right. Some had it on their breast, some on their\r\nshoulders. It is from the Bishop of Ely I have these facts, which he\r\ntells me are well authenticated.\"\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say now of the photographing of a landscape on the\r\ninside of the skin of sheep which had been struck by lightning? The\r\nrecord of this seems well authenticated.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, near the village of Combe-Hay, four miles from Bath, there\r\nwas a wood composed largely of oaks and nut trees. In the middle of it\r\nwas a field, about fifty yards long, in which six sheep were struck\r\ndead by lightning. When skinned, there was discovered on them, on the\r\ninside of the skin, a facsimile of part of the adjacent landscape.\r\nThese skins were exhibited at Bath.\r\n\r\nThis record was communicated by James Shaw to the Meteorological\r\nSociety of London at its session of March, 1857. Here are his own\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n\"I may add that the small field and its surrounding wood were familiar\r\nto me and my schoolmates, and that when the skins were shown to us we\r\nat once identified the local scenery so wonderfully represented.\"\r\n\r\nAndrès Poey tells us of these other curious cases:--\r\n\r\nIn the province of Sibacoa, Cuba, in August, 1823, lightning imprinted\r\non the trunk of a big tree a picture of a bent nail, which was to be\r\nfound, bent in the opposite direction, embedded in one of the upper\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 1852, in a plantation at St. Vincent in Cuba, a palm tree\r\nwas struck by lightning, and engraved on its dried leaves was a\r\npicture of pine trees which surrounded it at a distance of nearly 400\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nDr. Sestier tells us that after the 1850 meeting of the American\r\nAssociation, a person was killed by lightning while standing up near a\r\nwhitewashed wall, and that his silhouette was fixed upon the wall in a\r\ndark colour.\r\n\r\nWith such facts before us, we seem bound to believe in the existence\r\nof some kind of especial rays, ceraunic rays, emitted by lightning,\r\nand capable of photographing alike on the skin of human beings,\r\nanimals, and plants, more or less distinct pictures of objects far and\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nDecidedly, we have much to learn in this as well as in all the other\r\nbranches of knowledge.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Academie des Sciences, Août 3, 1868.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Conjectures physiques sur les plus extraordinaires effets du\r\nTonnerre.\" Paris, MDCXCVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED, LONDON AND BECCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors were corrected.\r\n\r\nDuplicate title at the beginning was deleted.\r\n\r\nHyphenation and accent variants were changed to the most frequently\r\nused in the original.
