No. VIII.\r\n\r\n                Thou only know'st\r\n    That dark meandering maze\r\n    Where wayward Falsehood strays,\r\n    And, seizing swift the lurking sprite,\r\n    Forces her forth to shame and light[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] Ode to Truth, from Mason's Caractacus.\r\n\r\nMan has been in all ages and countries, in a greater or less degree,\r\nthe victim of imposture and superstition. Their origin can every\r\nwhere be traced to rude and uncultivated periods of society; but\r\nsubsequent stages of comparative elegance and refinement have also\r\nministered to the support of their dominion. Egypt, Greece and\r\nRome were successively the seats of learning and science; yet in\r\nthese celebrated regions, the human mind was enveloped in darkness\r\nand loaded with chains. The Egyptians have this ancient proverb:\r\n\"It is easier to find a deity than a man.\"--Apotheosis must have\r\nbeen carried to an extraordinary length indeed when this was the\r\ncase. Among these deities, Isis was prominently distinguished, and\r\nuniversally worshipped. On her statues, these words were impudently\r\ninscribed: \"I am all that has been, that shall be, and none among\r\nmortals has hitherto taken off my veil!\" Who but would blush for\r\nthe credulity which listened with reverential awe to the oracular\r\nresponses at Delphi, a town situate in the neighbourhood of Mount\r\nParnassus, believed by every one at that time to be the centre of\r\nthe earth! And concerning this precious object, the wars denominated\r\nthe \"_sacred_ wars,\" were so furiously and destructively waged. The\r\nGrecians were compelled, under pain of death, rigidly to observe\r\nthe mysteries of Eleusis; and the wisest of the Romans were seen\r\nconsulting the flight of birds and the entrails of animals, for\r\ninfallible prognostics of future events. Where the footsteps of\r\n_true_ philosophy can be traced, her triumphs have been signal;\r\nand having found most of these and many other errors exploded, we\r\nlay claim in this enlightened age and country, to an extraordinary\r\nexemption from the influence of imposture and superstition. Although\r\nthe darkness and gloom of former ages have in a great degree fled\r\nat the approach of the light of knowledge, still here and there\r\nthe skirts of a black cloud remain, to indicate the failure of an\r\nabsolute conquest. And the presence of these potent adversaries of\r\nhuman happiness, should inculcate the duty on every friend of his\r\nspecies of lending his aid in advancing the cause of TRUTH.\r\n\r\nAmong the reprehensible customs which now obtain in the United\r\nStates, none are more affrontful to the good sense of the community,\r\nand few more pernicious in their effects on youth and inexperience,\r\nthan LOTTERIES, and the disgusting advertisements connected with\r\nthem, which daily appear in the public journals. The funds which\r\nconstitute a lottery, are principally derived from the pockets of\r\nthose whose straitened circumstances, prompt them to grasp at the\r\nglittering phantoms, paraded before their eyes by professional\r\njugglers.--Their minds become unsettled; a love of idleness and\r\nextravagance is excited; and their attention diverted from the true\r\nsources of prosperity--industry, frugality and sound morals. This\r\ncautionary advice may be deduced from the best and brightest of\r\nbooks; \"Make not haste to be rich.\"[2] Experience and observation\r\nunite in confirming its wisdom. We need but contemplate the\r\nconsequences, which have almost universally resulted to those who\r\nhave been so _fortunate_ as to draw large prizes! Nine times perhaps\r\nout of ten, bankruptcy and ruin have trodden close on the heels of\r\nthe dissipation and thoughtlessness they have occasioned. Lotteries\r\nare made by legislation, (which ought to be much better employed,)\r\na species of legalized gambling, altogether destitute, in every\r\npoint of view, of the slightest recommendation, to the countenance\r\nand patronage of the public. Being thus prejudicial to individual\r\nand social happiness, is it not to be lamented, that respectable\r\neditors instead of branding it as they ought, with its proper\r\ncharacteristics; should, to augment the profits of their papers,\r\ngive to this system of deception, the widest circulation, among all\r\nclasses of readers. These gentlemen should remember, that pecuniary\r\nsacrifices should sometimes be made at the shrine of virtue.\r\n\r\n  [2] Proverbs ch. xxviii. 22d verse.\r\n\r\nAnother source of imposture may be traced to the venders of QUACK\r\nMEDICINES. Few persons are, perhaps, aware of the amount of this\r\ntax, levied by unprincipled charlatans, on the afflicted and\r\ncredulous portion of the community. But it is not their money\r\nonly that is sacrificed, but frequently their constitutions and\r\ntheir lives. He, whose constant companions have long been Pain and\r\nDisease, is easily persuaded to listen to the confident promises of\r\nimpudent pretenders to medical science. He indulges the flattering\r\nbut false anticipation of returning health, until his symptoms\r\nassume an incurable character, and nature gives him the \"signal\r\nfor retreat.\" It is not to be expected, that for all the multiform\r\nshapes which vice is constantly assuming, remedies can be furnished\r\nby statutory provision. For many evils, and some of them of a\r\npositively mischievous character, no other cure can be relied on\r\nwith certainty, than the virtue and intelligence of the public. In\r\nproportion as these shall be cultivated, will be the augmentation\r\nof social enjoyment, and the increasing splendour of the orb of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by an eminent writer, that although all\r\nargument is against the existence of GHOSTS, all opinion is in its\r\nfavour.--The celebrated JOHN WESLEY, it is said, believed in them;\r\nand EDWARD CAVE asserted confidently, though he avoided dwelling\r\non the subject, that he had himself seen an apparition.--The\r\nstory of Mrs. VEAL, prefixed to Drelincourt on Death, though not\r\nconclusive, tended to strengthen such opinions. Few of those who\r\nheld them, were countenanced by stronger evidence than that detailed\r\nin the following authentic narrative. In the earlier periods of\r\nthe settlement of Pennsylvania, public houses of entertainment\r\nwere few and distant from each other. A farmer, who resided in\r\nMontgomery then Philadelphia county, was returning from market at\r\na late hour, of a cold winter night. As he was passing a meeting\r\nhouse, he discovered through the interstices of the door, a light\r\nwhich proceeded from a fire-place; there having been public worship\r\nheld there during the preceding day. Having dismounted and hitched\r\nhis horse, he proceeded to the door, and having opened it, beheld\r\na large fire burning, a man laying before it, and between this\r\nmysterious personage and the door, a coffin! He instinctively shrunk\r\nback, as the time, the place, and the circumstances he witnessed,\r\nwere well calculated to produce considerable excitement.--Summoning\r\nhis resolution, however, he advanced to the fire-place, where he\r\nfound a person asleep, and a new coffin along side of him. The man\r\ninformed him, that being a joiner, he was employed to make a coffin\r\nfor a relation who died a few miles above, and that he was taking\r\nit up from Germantown where he resided. It appeared that they had\r\nboth turned in with the same object, to warm themselves; and the\r\nhonest farmer was pleased to find the spectral apparition subside\r\ninto a sober reality. How fortunate would it be if on all occasions,\r\ninvestigation were equally honest and determined. Then, indeed,\r\nwould error and falsehood frequently be forced to \"SHAME AND LIGHT.\"\r\n                                                                 ☞\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy favourite occupation between school hours, during the Spring\r\nand Summer, is GARDENING. The munificence of some village Lorenzo\r\nhas bequeathed, for the use of the schoolmaster, several acres of\r\nground, well situated for tillage or ornamental purposes. Since\r\nI have been the incumbent, I have taken much pains to improve it\r\nby surrounding the chief part with hedges of cedar and thorn, and\r\nplanting a good selection of fruit and forest trees. The lower part\r\nof the field is in grass, and a winding gravel walk leads from one\r\ngroup of trees to another. Here, according to their various tastes\r\nand habits, may be seen the magnolias of our own and the southern\r\nstates, the walnut, the locust, the elm, the tulip tree, and the\r\ndifferent varieties of pine, and larch, and fir, which it has been\r\nmy study to arrange so as to diversify the view, and exhibit as\r\nmuch as my slender means would allow, the great families into which\r\nthe vegetable kingdom is divided. A brook as clear as crystal\r\nbabbles along through an adjoining lot, and enters mine towards the\r\nlower end. I have conducted it to a natural hollow in the ground,\r\nand have thus, at a trifling expense, formed a fish-pond, which adds\r\ngreatly to the beauty of my little domain, and furnishes me not only\r\nwith wholesome food for my own and my friends' tables, but is well\r\nsuited, from the natural moisture of its banks, for the cultivation\r\nof many of our beautiful ferns and aquatic plants. The middle of\r\nthe lot I have planted with the various fruit trees in which our\r\nclimate is so rich, if, indeed, it may not challenge a competition\r\nin this respect with the world. The upper and smaller portion of the\r\nlot, I have appropriated to what is called gardening in the stricter\r\nsense of the word. In marking out the walks, I have endeavoured to\r\nfollow, as nearly as I could, what the painters, perhaps a little\r\nfantastically, call the line of beauty, so as to have but few sharp\r\ncorners or square beds. At the prominent angles and the centres\r\nof the beds, are planted the Rhododendron; the two Kalmias; the\r\nscarlet, the tri-coloured and the flowering Azaleas; the Clethra\r\nand the Philadelphus, mingling with the most beautiful of the\r\ndomesticated foreign shrubbery--the different Roses, Honeysuckles,\r\nand Jessamines. Underneath, and among this shrubbery, are seen\r\nthe blue and scarlet Lobelias, the native Lily, the Gerardia, the\r\nArethusa, the Orchis, the Bartsia, the Epigea, and all those\r\nbeautiful flowers that spring up in our woods and meadows, and so\r\nfrequently bloom and die unseen or unappropriated. These native\r\nflowers make a fine show and not an unfavourable comparison even\r\nwith those beauties of Europe and the East that I have been able to\r\ncollect and arrange by their side.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular and egotistical in describing my garden,\r\nperhaps from vanity, but partly from a wish that the plan may be\r\nfollowed. Our native shrubbery and flowers are not surpassed in\r\nbeauty and splendour by those of any region in the temperate zone,\r\nand many of them in magnificence of foliage and colours are truly\r\ntropical. They are sought for abroad with great eagerness, and form\r\nan indispensable part of every gentleman's collection. I wish it\r\nwere more the custom for our farmers and cottagers to domesticate\r\nthem in their gardens and around their houses.--They improve\r\nmaterially by cultivation, and new varieties are frequently formed.\r\nWhat can be a more beautiful ornament to the front of a farm-house,\r\nor a neat white-washed cottage, than a Sweet-briar, winding between\r\nthe windows and over the door? or the Carolina Passion flower, the\r\nAlleghany Vine, the Clematis, or the scarlet Trumpet flower? These\r\nrural decorations add more than one would imagine, who had not tried\r\nthem, to the innocent pleasures of a family; they have no small\r\ninfluence in forming the taste of children; they form a favourite\r\nretreat for the birds; and they fling over the whole country an air\r\nof peace, and contentment, and innocent enjoyment, which no one,\r\nwho has not travelled in the more beautiful and retired parts of\r\nEngland, can fully appreciate.\r\n\r\nI recollect once in riding through the valley of Chester county with\r\nsome foreign gentlemen, that they were struck with the nakedness and\r\nrudeness of the farm-houses. It appeared to them the most beautiful\r\nregion they had ever seen, and they exclaimed, with one voice, that\r\nthe inhabitants did not seem worthy of possessing it. On the side\r\nof some sloping hill and in front of a lawn as smooth as velvet, or\r\nladen with the riches of the harvest, would be seen a barn and a\r\nhouse that looked as if the master and horse had changed lodgings,\r\nboth of rude unhewn stone, without a single tree, or shrub, or a\r\ntrailing vine, for shade or ornament. Such an insensibility to the\r\nbeauties of rural decoration, in a region where every thing seems\r\ncalculated to call out and quicken the taste, is unnatural, and can\r\nonly arise from sordid habits or ignorance.\r\n\r\nIf these hasty remarks should call the attention of our farmers to\r\nthe subject, and induce them to devote some of their leisure hours\r\nto the ornamenting of their grounds, I shall be richly rewarded;\r\nand I can promise to them also a rich reward.--Their houses will be\r\nmore cool and healthful, and they will find that by encouraging in\r\ntheir children a taste for gardening, and for observing the native\r\nbeauties of our forests, their fondness for the innocent pleasures\r\nof home and for reading will be increased, together with that\r\nunambitious ease and industry which form the distinguishing traits\r\nin the character of a virtuous peasantry.\r\n\r\nI began this paper with a design to eulogise the art of gardening,\r\nand investigate its effects on the mind. I have been diverted,\r\nhowever, from my purpose, and must, in a future number, resume the\r\ndisquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE AFRICAN PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that sufficient consideration is given to the\r\ncase of those black people, who have been rendered free by or under\r\nthe laws of the states and old provinces, from the earliest period.\r\nWe have established in the city and county of Philadelphia, in\r\nPennsylvania, _a system professing to be for the universal education\r\nof the poor_, at the public expense, to which the black people, by\r\nthe taxes upon their real property, consumption taxes, and all the\r\ntaxes of the whites (except the little personal or occupation tax,)\r\nactually contribute. It cannot be denied, that many of them are as\r\ntruly among the poor, as the most and least poor of the white heads\r\nof families, whose children are admitted to this _constitutional_\r\nand legal provision. The blacks also pay all the consumption duties\r\non imported foreign articles, so far as they consume them.\r\n\r\nWe ought to consider the very low state of the proper blacks in\r\nAfrica, where their uncivilized condition has long been most\r\nunhappily made worse by the neighbourhood of the four Saracen or\r\nMoorish piratical States of Barbary, devoted to military plunder,\r\nthe slavery of the whites and blacks, and the imposter superstitions\r\nof Mahomet, sacrilegiously pretending to add himself to the Almighty\r\nin the government of his church and his earth. Besides these, the\r\nslave dealers of the world have resorted to the African ports and\r\nislands, and have combined with powerful, avaricious, and inhuman\r\nprinces and dealers, in that country, to make out a course of slave\r\ntraffic with every nation, in whose system of industry African\r\nslaves are more profitable and efficient than white labourers. From\r\nthe islands of Bourbon, Mauritius and Madagascar, round by the Cape\r\nof Good Hope and up to the Saracen or Moorish kingdom of Morocco,\r\nthis system has long prevailed. It is unhappily true, that the\r\ngreat collection of proper Negro districts of Africa, remain now\r\nin the darkest state of irreligion, immorality and incivilization.\r\nIt is also true, that this is so rooted in their system, that the\r\nactual transfer, since the year 1620, of a number of Africans\r\nto this country now amounting, with their descendants, to about\r\none million and a half of the unmixed and mixed breeds, is to be\r\nconsidered as _a great and complicated dispensation of Divine\r\nProvidence_, drawing that numerous people into the bosom and body of\r\nan enlightened nation, averse to the traffic, from the date of the\r\n_first_ act of Virginia of 1778, _abolishing the slave trade_, to\r\nthe present consummation of that prohibition, under the laws of the\r\nUnion. We have gone, _first_ in Pennsylvania, one step further by\r\nour act of 1780, which, while it unhappily recognized _the slavery\r\nof all the living_, instead of emancipating three or four thousand\r\nat the public expense, or at the expense of the holders, confined\r\nits operation to establishing the freedom of those who should be\r\n_thereafter_ born of the slaves held and continuing to be held among\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIn order, so far as in us lies, humbly to justify and bless the\r\ndispensation of Providence, which has drawn these people out of the\r\ngloomy abyss of the human family in the vast African black-peopled\r\ndistrict, stained as it unhappily partially is even by the awful\r\ncannibal practice, and by human sacrifices, let us, of Pennsylvania,\r\nwho have been first to make their native American _posterity_\r\nfree, be the most distinguished, _in justice to their submissive\r\nand patient early labours in forming our fair old province_, in\r\ndispensing to them the benefits of that religious, moral, scholastic\r\nand professional education, without which they cannot live in the\r\ngood hopes of this their earthly residence or of the world beyond\r\nthe grave.--It is well understood, that our city and county school\r\nsystem is not practically and effectually extended to the poor black\r\npeople. An appeal is respectfully made to the friends of religion,\r\nmorals, useful knowledge, and general industry, whether we ought not\r\nto dispense to them a more generous, just and civilized freedom.\r\nIf we mean to avoid arguments against the gradual and ultimate\r\nabolition of slavery, let us endeavour to instruct them in all those\r\nthings, which will enable them to labour with advantage, to get\r\ntheir own living in the progressive station on this continent, to\r\nwhich it has pleased God to suffer them to be transferred. To the\r\nblack people themselves, it is proper to recommend a very modest and\r\ngood conduct in all things, without which _they_ cannot succeed, nor\r\ncan the endeavours of _their best friends_ be availing and effectual.\r\n\r\n_A Friend of all the Poor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nON GIMCRACKERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invention of new instruments and machines is among the noblest\r\nexertions of the human faculties. It is said to be considered by\r\nsome philosophers as the most striking distinguishing character\r\nbetween our species and the brute creation, that man is a\r\n_tool-making_ animal. He is certainly the only one who selects his\r\ninstruments with care and adapts them to his purposes, by altering\r\ntheir shape and structure. At any rate, the temporal advantages\r\nwhich we possess over the beasts, are universally, perhaps,\r\nobtained through this medium. As this is the case, one might suppose\r\nthat they who invent and improve these engines of superiority,\r\nwould receive the homage of their fellow men to their talents and\r\nthanks for their benefit to the human race. Why, then, what is\r\ncalled Gimcrackery should fall into disrepute, is an inquiry of some\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nWe cannot well deny the truth of the very common remark, that\r\ninventors are very apt to fail of realizing, by their ingenuity, a\r\nsolid provision for life; nor can we well avoid concluding, that\r\nof the many contrivances daily offered to the public, that the\r\nprobability of any one becoming permanently useful is very small\r\nindeed. When we consider, however, that the great mass of these\r\ninventions are designed for the attainment of wealth, and that such\r\nan amount of skill and ingenuity are employed, the above conclusions\r\ncannot fail to appear singular. One would think inventors could not,\r\nwith these acknowledged talents, well fail of at least securing\r\ntheir own independence, although their schemes may not be profitable\r\nto others. If, however, we analyse the motives by which such persons\r\nare guided, we shall find, I think, some explanation.\r\n\r\nThere are few if any men who are not more or less influenced by a\r\ndesire of some species of fame or distinction, although, in many\r\nof the common situations of life, this does not interfere with the\r\npursuit of wealth, and only shows itself in moments of relaxation\r\nfrom the toils of necessity. For one who wishes to signalize himself\r\nin his trade or profession, and who is swayed by that desire as a\r\nruling passion, there are probably many who seek to gratify their\r\npride, by the pursuit of eminence in other things. People aim at\r\ndistinction in conversational wit, in politics, philosophy or even\r\ndrinking or gaming; while the hours devoted to business are guided\r\nby the wish for property alone, undisturbed by the love of fame.\r\nIn the persons of whom we are speaking, this feeling, inseparable\r\nfrom the nature of man, has a powerful influence on their serious\r\nbusiness. They are not to get wealth only, but distinction, by their\r\ntalents; and I question much whether they are not more under the\r\ninfluence of a wish for the latter than the former. Praise is most\r\ngenerally, at least in this instance, gained by a single exertion,\r\nand by the study of a short time. The invention once made, and its\r\napplicability rendered plausible, all further contemplation of the\r\nsubject is accompanied by an exulting hope that fills and occupies\r\nthe mind. But applying either inventions or any other means to the\r\ncommon business of life, is a more monotonous, common-place labour,\r\nthat affords no high and exhilarating excitement to persevere. The\r\nconsequence too often is that the inventor quits one hopeful scheme\r\nbefore it is half reduced to practice, to fly to something still\r\nmore new; showing by this that he is fonder of the act of inventing\r\nthan of making money by the results. Of this preference of fame to\r\nwealth, a striking instance is often afforded by those illiterate\r\npersons who follow this pursuit. These often voluntarily abstain\r\nfrom studying the scientific labours of their predecessors, of which\r\nI have known instances, in order to preserve the originality of\r\ntheir projects, though frequently at the expense of their perfection\r\nand utility. If, then, the larger portion of the labour of these men\r\nis devoted to the attainment of celebrity, they can hardly quarrel\r\nwith results of their own making, nor expect fortune to come to\r\ntheir hands unsought.\r\n\r\nPersons who wish to acquire wealth, or, in fact, to achieve any\r\npermanent end, are generally obliged to use steady perseverance, and\r\nto apply all the talents they are masters of for a length of time.\r\nPrecisely the same is the case with inventors. That inventor meets\r\nwith very extraordinary success indeed, who is not obliged, in the\r\napplication of his plans to a useful purpose, to employ prudence\r\nand economy, and all those qualities which enable a man to conduct\r\nbusiness to advantage and to influence the minds of others. Hence it\r\nis that inventions so often lie for a length of years, forgotten or\r\nneglected, till some one of less originality, but more perseverence,\r\ninfluence and mercantile calculation, carries them into effect with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe want of being acquainted with the efforts and discoveries of\r\npredecessors is the cause of prodigious waste of time and talent.\r\nHence the thousand schemes for perpetual motion, and a variety of\r\nother attempts scarce less extravagant, because made with equal\r\nignorance. And, in fact, there is a strong tendency in having\r\nacquired the knowledge of the labours of others, to clip the wings\r\nof invention, and render men of learning much less apt to attempt\r\nnovelties than while they knew less.\r\n\r\nExtravagance in pecuniary matters is another frequent cause of the\r\nruin of ingenious artists and of those who trust in them. This is\r\nshown, both in imprudently investing considerable sums of money\r\nwithout a reasonable probability of a return, and in the general\r\nlavish style in which such men often live and experiment.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to turn inventions to advantage, requires the singling\r\nout of one good, feasible plan, mercantile prudence in calculating\r\nprobabilities, and mercantile economy in the conduct of the\r\nbusiness, together with perseverence enough to prevent marring one\r\nscheme by prematurely beginning another. These qualities are so\r\nrarely found in combination with mechanical originality, or, indeed\r\nwith that restless versatility which keeps men on the search for its\r\nproductions, that it will perhaps always continue to be generally\r\nthe case; that one man shall invent and persuade another to make\r\nexperimental trials, but a third, and one totally unconnected with\r\neither, if any one, shall reap the increase.\r\n\r\n  S. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTIONS OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo subject can more deeply interest the planters and farmers of\r\nthis country. Our merchants can export every American production\r\nwithout duty, tax or impediment. We have all the benefits of a\r\nforeign, coasting, and interior trade, free as to our own laws, and\r\nthe national government are constantly engaged in negotiations and\r\nregulations calculated to soften or remove the inconveniences of\r\nforeign monopolies in commerce and navigation. Such measures are\r\npending now with Britain and France.\r\n\r\nWhen trade has exhausted its power to find a profitable market,\r\nabroad or at home, the conversion of our unsaleable surplus produce\r\ninto new forms, commonly denominated _domestic manufactures_,\r\nbecomes an object of reasonable consideration. It is well known,\r\nthat the cultivated soil and the bowels of the earth give us the\r\nfollowing principal objects as the fruits of the culture of the\r\nland, or as its spontaneous productions. 1, Hemp; 2, Flax; 3, Wool;\r\n4, Iron; 5, Silk; 6, Hides and Skins; 7, Sugar; 8, Indigo, Woad,\r\nMadder; 9, Grass; 10, Grain; 11, Wood; 12, Tobacco, and 13, Cotton.\r\nSuch has long been the unforced state of our manufacturing industry,\r\nthat in 1797, in 1810, and in 1819, we did not export any surplus\r\nor quantity, however small, of the first eight of those valuable\r\nproductions. Our manufacturers, without the war or double, or\r\npresent duties, bought at home and worked up the whole. The returns\r\nof exports prove, that we did not ship any part of several of\r\nthose articles, and if we shipped a little of some, we imported a\r\ngreater weight and value of the same kinds of foreign produce or raw\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nOf the 9th article, Grass or Hay, we shipped very little, screwed\r\ninto compact bundles for the West Indies.\r\n\r\nOf the 10th, Grain, with some Fruit and Molasses, we have a brewery\r\nand distillery, a cider and general liquor manufacture, equal to\r\nforty millions of gallons, and requiring a quantity of produce equal\r\nto the value of sixteen millions of bushels of grain, of which above\r\nseven-eighth parts are drawn from our own lands. This is equal to\r\nthe value of seven millions of barrels of flour, and we did not\r\nship to foreign countries, in 1819, more than 750,000 barrels. It\r\nis plain, that the liquor manufactories of the United States (to\r\nwhich we are adding wine, worth to France 100,000,000 dollars,)\r\nare a very principal support of our agriculture.--We also make of\r\ngrain, quantities of starch, hair-powder, sizing, paste, ship bread,\r\nwafers and vermicelli, hominy, firmity, soft bread, pastry and\r\nother preparations of grain. It is converted into fatted cattle,\r\nhogs and poultry. Ingenuity is and should be on the stretch to\r\nemploy and profitably consume grain. Pork and beef maintain better\r\nprices abroad than the grain (or meal thereof,) with which we feed\r\ncattle and hogs. The prohibition of spirits, and the distillation of\r\nmolasses, in St. Domingo, will cut off our supply of molasses.\r\n\r\nOf the 11th article, Wood, we have now one manufacture (our sea\r\nvessels, coasters, river and other boats,) worth 40 or 50 millions\r\nof dollars. We manufacture, for exportation, from 120 to 180\r\nmillions of staves, heading, hoops, boards, scantling, plank, and\r\nwe have an immense cooperage for foreign and domestic sale and\r\nuse. Besides buildings, fences, cabinet ware, carriages, ploughs,\r\nharrows, handspikes, turnery, boxes, cases, faggots, cord-wood, &c.\r\n&c., to a vast amount, profiting the owners and clearers of wood\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n12. Tobacco, of which we manufacture nearly all we consume, and\r\nfabricate as much for exportation, probably, as we import in a\r\nmanufactured state for our consumption. We could manufacture a\r\nquantity of tobacco equal to the supply shipped by all Europe.\r\n\r\nOf Cotton, we are supposed to manufacture 30,000,000 of pounds,\r\nshipping above three times that weight to foreign countries. We\r\nyearly increase in the goodness, fineness, utility, variety and\r\nvalue of our cotton manufactures. The looms of the United States\r\nwere, in A. D. 1810, 325,000, of which North Carolina and Virginia,\r\ncotton and wool states, had the most, being each nearly 41,000\r\nlooms. The water and steam are well established, and work lower than\r\nthe cheapest hand looms of Europe or Asia.\r\n\r\nThe plain instruction, of these genuine facts, to our planters\r\nand farmers, is, to encourage household manufactures, and all\r\nother manufactures on the estates, at the doors, in the townships,\r\nvillages, and counties in which they live, consuming raw materials,\r\nbuilding materials, food for man and beast, fuel, drinks, and other\r\nproductions of the earth. This system of adjacent manufactures saves\r\nall the cost of transportation of our productions to the sea-ports,\r\nand the expense of carrying foreign goods from the sea-ports to the\r\ninterior, more profitable than canals and turnpike roads.\r\n\r\nEvery judicious member of the agricultural body must be a friend\r\nto the freedom and encouragement of our foreign commerce, as\r\naffording a constant and sure market for a considerable portion of\r\nthe productions of the earth. But, that manufactures afford also\r\na very great and sure market for a larger variety, quantity and\r\nvalue of our landed productions, is no less manifest and certain.\r\nThe nail mill, the paper mill, the screw mill, the brewery, the\r\nspinning and weaving mills, the calico printing mill, the pottery,\r\nand many other works and arts to fabricate useful necessary supplies\r\nout of our raw materials, will (including all our manufactures) be\r\nworth, in the whole of 1820, more than five times the value of our\r\nexported goods for sale in foreign countries. Let every farmer,\r\nplanter, iron-master, &c., therefore, encourage manufactures in his\r\nhousehold, on his estate, and in his neighbourhood, as the surest\r\nmethod of making a profitable home demand, without the expense\r\nof transportation, for the fruits of his labour, and the natural\r\nproductions of his forests, mines and quarries. We purposely avoid\r\nto urge forcing and protecting duties, referring only to those\r\nexisting, which have been ordained principally for the purpose\r\nof raising the requisite public revenue. We do not interfere in\r\nthe agitation of the question about protecting duties. We believe\r\nthe cheapness of produce and labour and improved machinery and\r\nlabour-saving processes, will occasion manufactures to prosper and\r\nincrease, and thus to support the growers of produce and the owners\r\nof the land, beyond even our free and valuable trade. To this, the\r\nduties laid for revenue, for defence, and for the encouragement of\r\nagriculture, will materially contribute; such as the impost upon\r\nEast India cotton goods, of 27½ to 62½ and even 80 and 90 per\r\ncent., as made entirely of foreign cotton, rival to our cotton,\r\nflax, hemp, wool and silk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTED FROM THE MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS OF C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _On the increase of the Domestic Sugar of the United States._\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be a great acquisition to our country, if we could\r\nproduce from our own soil whatever sugar might be necessary for\r\nour own consumption, without having recourse to foreign Islands\r\nor nations; it will therefore be satisfactory, I apprehend, to all\r\nlovers of their country to find that we are already making rapid\r\nadvances, as will appear to any person who attentively weighs the\r\nfollowing items of information, collected at different times from\r\nour public newspapers; from whence it may be inferred, that before\r\nmany years have expired a supply sufficient for our own use will be\r\nfurnished within our own territories.\r\n\r\n1812, January 10--Albert Gallatin, Esq. then Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, informed the Committee of Ways and Means, in a letter,\r\nthat the Western States were then entirely supplied with salt of\r\ndomestic produce; and that they consumed annually seven millions of\r\npounds of sugar, made from the Sugar Maple tree, which, says he, is\r\nnearly all they use. Now, if in 1812 the _Western_ States produced\r\n7,000,000 pounds of sugar from such trees, it is probable that in\r\n1820, _they_ would produce not less than 10,000,000 in a year. If to\r\nthis we add what is yielded in the states of Vermont, New York, and\r\nPennsylvania, it seems likely that the whole amount of such sugar,\r\nnow made annually in the United States, is not less than 15 millions\r\nof pounds.\r\n\r\nBy a publication in a late newspaper, it appears that there were\r\nexported from New Orleans, in six months preceding 1st May, 1820,\r\n15,652 hogsheads of sugar; all this no doubt was of their own growth\r\nand produced from the Sugar Cane. I am informed by a dealer in\r\nsugar, that the sugar hogsheads of New Orleans do not average less\r\nthan 1000 pounds to each hogshead, making, in six months, 15,652,000\r\npounds, and in the whole year probably 20,000,000 pounds; total of\r\nsugar from the Sugar tree and Cane, 35,000,000 pounds annually.\r\nThis exhibits a very rapid increase in the amount of sugar made,\r\nas I think Secretary Gallatin, in an older communication, not 20\r\nyears ago, stated that New Orleans at that time exported only about\r\n2,000,000 of pounds of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe supply now furnished as above will probably be greatly augmented\r\nin future years, from the same sources.\r\n\r\nAdd to these the prospect of sugar to be raised or produced from the\r\nCane in Carolina and Georgia, as may be collected from the following\r\nitems, selected from the newspapers also, viz.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, Thomas Spalding made on Sapelo Island, in lat. 31½, as\r\nmuch as 95 hogsheads of excellent sugar, equal to Jamaica, from\r\nCanes he had planted there.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, Major Butler, on his plantation in South Carolina, produced\r\nby the labour of seventeen hands, off of 85 acres of land, 140,000\r\npounds of sugar, and 75 hogsheads of molasses.\r\n\r\nAlso, John M'Queen, off of 18 acres, had 20,000 Canes per acre,\r\nworked by five or six hands; 5,000 Canes, the produce of one quarter\r\nof an acre, yielded 600 gallons of juice, which boiled down made\r\n672 pounds sugar, and may lose 50 pounds in draining, leaving 622\r\npounds; or per acre, of sugar, 2,488 pounds.\r\n\r\nAgain, as to the Sugar Maple tree, or as some say it is more\r\nproperly styled, \"The Sugar Tree;\" in 1815, 64,000 pounds of sugar\r\nwere made in the town of Plattsburgh, Clinton county, New York. In\r\n1818, 22,000 pounds were made by 80 families, in one township in\r\nBradford county, Pennsylvania, which is on an average 275 pounds to\r\neach family.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt but that arrangements might be made by\r\nsome of the merchants of Philadelphia, to procure a regular supply\r\nof the best Sugar Tree sugar, for the accommodation of such persons\r\nas are religiously scrupulous of using sugar made from the Cane,\r\nwhich is produced by the labour of slaves.\r\n\r\nI have seen Maple sugar with which sufficient pains had been taken\r\nin the making and draining, that was as handsome in its appearance\r\nand as well tasted and good in every respect, I thought, as any West\r\nIndia sugar I had ever seen, and when refined equal to any loaf\r\nsugar. Of which, I remember H. D. of this city, merchant, since\r\ndeceased, about the year 1789, sent some boxes as a present to\r\ngeneral Washington, then president of the United States, residing in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nNear twenty years ago, when little domestic sugar was made in the\r\nUnited States, I computed from the duties paid, that the whole\r\nconsumption of sugar annually in our country, then, was about\r\nten pounds for every individual, on an average. There are now, I\r\nsuppose, ten millions of inhabitants in the United States, who, at\r\nthe above ratio, would consume annually 100,000,000 pounds sugar, of\r\nwhich we now make 35,000,000 lbs. per annum, as above calculated.\r\n\r\nLast winter there was an account in some of the newspapers, that\r\na person in Virginia had obtained a patent for making sugar from\r\nwheat, rye or Indian corn; that it was good sugar, and that each\r\nbushel yielded fifteen pounds. I have heard no more of it, but\r\nif well founded, this would be the greatest acquisition of all,\r\nbecause, in every part of our country, sugar, without the use\r\nof slaves, could be made in the greatest abundance, and might\r\nbeneficially supplant the practice of making so much pernicious\r\nwhiskey, in places remote from sea-ports.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been now stated, there seems to be scarce room for a\r\ndoubt, but that in a few years, we can be supplied from domestic\r\nsources with all the sugar we shall want for our own consumption.\r\n\r\nBy an account of Joseph Cooper's native Grape Vine, published in\r\nyour Rural Magazine, No. 7, page 247 as little doubt can exist but\r\nthat with proper care by the farmers, our country may also be\r\nsupplied with good wine, sufficient for our own use, and probably\r\nwith more profit to the growers, than they can find by pursuing the\r\nold beaten track of adhering almost entirely to grain which is now\r\nso low in price.\r\n\r\nThe southern and western parts of our territories would, probably,\r\nwith proper encouragement, yield all the coffee and silk we might be\r\nable to consume.\r\n\r\nAll these, and many other objects of culture, are proper for the\r\nattention, recommendation and encouragement of state legislatures,\r\nof agricultural societies, and of all patriotic members of society.\r\nThus we may become, in time, really independent; and from the extent\r\nof our country, and the variety of its climates, come to consider\r\nour own dominions as a world of our own, producing nearly all that\r\nis necessary for the use of man, as Sir George Staunton, in his\r\nEmbassy, says the Chinese consider their vast extensive empire. This\r\nconsideration, probably, makes them in a great measure, regardless\r\nof foreign trade.\r\n\r\n  C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nENCOURAGEMENT FOR FARMERS ON POOR LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is believed, that many productions possess a delicacy in their\r\nqualities, when raised on light soils, which they have not, when\r\ngrown on rich and fat soils. The wool produced on the poor South\r\nDown soils of Great Britain is far superior to the wool raised on\r\nthe rich alluvion lands of Lincolnshire in that country. The wines\r\nproduced among the gravels and pebbles of the _Medoc_ district near\r\nBordeaux are much superior to the wines produced on the _palus_ or\r\nalluvion lands between the two rivers Lot and Garonne in the same\r\nvicinity. The Tesamum produces the most delicate oil from light\r\nsoils. This suggestion is worthy of consideration and experiment\r\nin respect to animals, fruits, grains, and gardeners and farmers'\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the July No. of the North American Review.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letters écrites d'Italie en 1812 et 13, à M. Charles Pictet,\r\n     l'un des Rédacteurs de la Bibliothéque Britannique par Fréderic\r\n     Sullin de Chateauvieux. A Paris et à Genéve._ 1816, 2 vols.\r\n     12mo. pp. 576.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there are none of our natural advantages which it still\r\nremains for us fully to appreciate and avail ourselves of, so much\r\nas those which respect the agriculture of our country.\r\n\r\nWithout running into all the errors of the economists or adopting\r\ntheir entire theory, we trust that we may assert the paramount\r\nimportance of this pursuit, particularly to the United States. To\r\nevery country it affords at least a partial, and often a complete\r\nsubsistence for its population; it gives a constant and healthful\r\nemployment to sometimes more than half and never less than a fifth\r\nof the community; its profits though not so large, are more certain\r\nthan those in other employments of captal; and while it replaces the\r\nannual advance invested, a surplus profit has accrued, which can be\r\nemployed as private interest and the public good may require.[3]\r\nBut in the United States the cultivation of the soil has these\r\nand many more advantages; nay, it is intimately connected with our\r\nnational character, because it powerfully acts upon the morals\r\nand constitution of our citizens. If it be true, that the torch\r\nof liberty has always burned with a purer and brighter lustre on\r\nthe mountains than on the plains, it is still more true, that the\r\nsentiments of honour and integrity more generally animate the rough\r\nbut manly form of the farmer, than the debilitated body of the\r\nartisan. There is in that primitive and honourable occupation, the\r\nculture of the earth, something which, while it pours into the lap\r\nof the state an increase beyond every other employment, gives us\r\nmore than the fabled stone, not only a subsistence, but a placid\r\nfeeling of contentment; not only creates the appetite to enjoy, but\r\nguarantees its continuance by a robust constitution, fortified with\r\nthe safeguards of temperance and virtue.\r\n\r\n  [3] 'Farmers and country labourers, on the contrary, may enjoy\r\n  completely the whole funds destined for their own subsistence,\r\n  and yet augment at the same time the revenue and wealth of their\r\n  society. Over and above what is destined for their own subsistence,\r\n  their industry annually affords a neat produce, of which the\r\n  augmentation necessarily augments the revenue and wealth of their\r\n  society.' _Smith's Wealth of Nations,_ Vol. 111. p. 178.\r\n\r\n  'Farmers and country labourers, indeed, over and above the stock\r\n  which maintains and employs them, reproduce annually a neat produce,\r\n  a free rent to the landlord.' _Ibid_, p. 186.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of our countrymen to possess in fee a spot of ground\r\nhowever small, and the consequent paucity of leases, is a fact no\r\nless curious than it is solitary. This is not the case, or at least\r\nin any considerable degree, in any other country. Such indeed in\r\nBritain were formerly those small proprietors called franklins, who\r\npossessed a keen spirit of independence and a determined opposition\r\nto oppression; feelings which, with the alienation of their farms,\r\nhave gradually departed from the breasts of their descendants.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, however, the ease with which the pride of\r\nindependent possession may be gratified, it is not the less true\r\nthat agriculture, instead of being a favoured, has been a degraded\r\nand unpopular pursuit; that instead of cherishing every motive\r\nwhich might lead to its honourable extension, we have endeavoured\r\ngradually to weaken its legitimate efforts. It is indeed a singular\r\ninquiry, why the cultivation of the soil among us should have been\r\nso little encouraged, when every state in Europe, since the peace\r\nof Aix-la-Chapelle, has turned its most assiduous attention to\r\nthis most important department of domestic economy, and ultimately\r\nborrowed from it the resources which have carried them through the\r\nprodigious conflicts of the last generation.\r\n\r\nThere have been many causes, certainly not all of equal efficacy,\r\nwhich have co-operated against the interests of agriculture. But\r\nthere is a prominent one to which we can but just allude. During\r\na very considerable period, since the peace of '83, the peculiar\r\nsituation of Europe has afforded opportunities for commercial\r\nenterprise too tempting to be resisted.--American merchants\r\nreceived, in the lapse of a very few years, the most astonishing\r\naccessions of wealth; and fortunes, ordinarily the fruit of a\r\nlaborious life, and never the portion of many, were amassed with\r\nunparalleled rapidity, and by large numbers. Our domestic prosperity\r\nmore than equalled the extension of our trade. It was then that the\r\ncompting-houses of our merchants were filled with youth from the\r\ncountry, who forsook the slower but surer emoluments of agriculture,\r\nfor the mushroom but unsubstantial fortunes of commerce; nay, who\r\npreferred the meanest drudgery behind the counter of a retail\r\ndealer, to the manly and invigorating toil of the cultivator of\r\nhis paternal acres. Unfortunately this spirit of migration was\r\nencouraged by too great a success in trade. Feelings of vulgar\r\npride contracted in town caused the manual labour of the farmer\r\nto be regarded as degrading; this unworthy sentiment spread with\r\nbaleful influence, and when the compting-houses became overstocked\r\nand afforded no longer a resource, it was no uncommon thing to see\r\na young man with no qualifications but a little bad Latin picked up\r\nat a miserable village school, forsake a large and fertile farm and\r\napprentice himself to a poor country attorney.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the depressed state of agriculture, mentioned in\r\nlate publication,[4] is the constant emigration to the west. There\r\nmust necessarily be a tendency to a most empoverishing system of\r\ncultivation, where people feel that after having extracted all\r\nthe richness of the soil, they may throw it up and remove to a\r\ncountry, which offers them an untouched surface, and needs no\r\nartificial aid of composts or manure. The land, besides suffering\r\nfrom negligence consequent on the prospect of departure, will be\r\nworn out by successive crops, and long be rendered unfit for the\r\nmost valuable dispositions of the agriculturist. Indeed we have been\r\ninformed, that in many instances, when the land is almost ruined\r\nby the continued culture of tobacco, it is sold by the planter to\r\nsome enterprizing and laborious individual, who may restore it by\r\nhis patience and attention, while he himself removes to another\r\nspot, where the same wretched system of exhaustion may again be\r\nrenewed.--There are other causes we might mention, such as the\r\nunwieldy size of our farms, and particularly the want of a regular\r\nenlightened farming system. But we cannot now stop to enter on these\r\ntopics, but may notice them hereafter.\r\n\r\n  [4] Letters on the Eastern States.\r\n\r\nIf then agriculture be so important an item in a nation's resources,\r\naffording such subsistence to its population, and a surplus\r\ncapital to be employed in the various objects of national industry\r\nand enterprise, it would seem to follow, that nothing but very\r\nimperious circumstances should induce any government to repress its\r\nvigour, or palsy the exertions of those devoted to it. Immediately\r\nconnected with such an attempt was the late bill before Congress,\r\nestablishing a new tariff of duties. But why go back to a bill\r\nwhich was rejected? We answer, that it is not to be forgotten that\r\nprivate interest is one of the most powerful incentives to action,\r\nthat the manufacturing interest is large and increasing, that one\r\ndefeat will not discourage its partisans, and lastly, extraordinary\r\nas the fact may seem, that the bill in question, fraught with such\r\nvaried evil, was thrown out by a majority of only _one_ vote in the\r\nsenate. The tendency of this project was not only to introduce an\r\nunequal system of taxation, but first, by the destruction of a large\r\npart of our foreign commerce, to diminish very materially the market\r\nfor our home products, and secondly, to divert a large portion of\r\nagricultural industry into the service of the loom and spinning\r\njenny.\r\n\r\nBut it will be asked, are manufactures then to be entirely\r\nneglected? Most certainly not. Still there is a certain limit, in\r\na newly settled country with a thin population, beyond which their\r\nestablishment is not only useless to government, but a burden to\r\nthe people. It is undoubtedly true that the manufacture of articles\r\nof immediate necessity or very general circulation ought to be\r\nencouraged by a wise and provident people; but it ordinarily happens\r\nthat these need no extraordinary patronage; their extended use\r\nsoon gives a facility to the artist, which enables him to enter\r\ninto competition with the foreigner, provided the raw material is\r\nto be found at home in any tolerable abundance. Thus we find that\r\nhats were manufactured in the colonies at a very early period;\r\ntogether with household furniture, saddlery, &c. they have long\r\nsince ceased to be an article of importation. It is necessary for\r\nthe well-being and security of a nation, that certain articles,\r\nshould be manufactured within its limits, such as gunpowder, coarse\r\nclothing, and some others of a similar discription.--But the moment\r\npeople attempt to force by means of high duties on foreign imports\r\nthe production of a commodity, which, by reason of the extravagance\r\nof the wages of labour and other causes, must necessarily be sold at\r\na much greater price than the imported one, their conduct would seem\r\nno less an affront to common sense, than a solecism in political\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe United States possess a very restricted capital; and as the\r\ntilling of the soil requires comparatively much fewer advances than\r\nany other department of industry, that capital became immediately\r\ninvested in agriculture. Land, cheap, and fertile, constituted\r\na fund which gave a certain profit. And as the productions of\r\nthe labour of more than five eighths of our population went to\r\npurchase foreign articles either of luxury or necessity, a great and\r\nprofitable intercourse was constantly maintained with Europe. Under\r\nan equitable system of foreign duties, arising from this commerce,\r\nthe expenses of government were defrayed, our debt gradually\r\nextinguished, and by a powerful but necessary re-action our\r\nagriculture improved and extended. But the tariff bill restricted a\r\nlarge and valuable commerce principally with Britain. It is not to\r\nbe supposed that, while we refused the broadcloths and hardware of\r\nEngland, she would still continue to buy the same proportion of our\r\ncotton and tobacco. Our market then for these articles would be so\r\nfar lost; and if we now feel the effects of a diminished demand for\r\nour produce in consequence of the establishment of peace in Europe,\r\nhow can it be thought a wise policy to suffer other embarrassments\r\nand losses, by excluding ourselves entirely from every foreign port\r\nwhere we might calculate upon its sale? Where then is our produce\r\nto find a vent? For assuredly the most enthusiastic friend of\r\ndomestic manufactures could never imagine, that the most extensive\r\nestablishment of them could ever give an adequate consumption for\r\nthe present amount of our agricultural productions.\r\n\r\nThe bill then imposing heavy duties on foreign articles, besides\r\ndiminishing the number of the cultivators of the soil, would in some\r\ndegree operate as a tax on its fruits, because, while the price of\r\nmanufactures was enormously increased, the value of produce would\r\nbe more than proportionally diminished. For the cultivator, not\r\nonly deprived of the benefit of a competition between the domestic\r\nand foreign consumer in the sale of his articles, is obliged to\r\npurchase those of his neighbour, at any price which his cupidity\r\nand the tariff may determine. The expenses of the state being still\r\nthe same and its usual resources dried up, a general but unequal\r\nsystem of taxation would be adopted, which in fact, the farmer\r\nbending under the weight of this partial policy, is less able to\r\npay whatever contribution may be levied. These assertions are by\r\nno means novel, they are mere corollaries from the plainest and\r\nmost undoubted principles of political economy. Dr. Adam Smith, the\r\ngreat father of the science, and all whose views on this subject,\r\nthough not acted upon in a country whose domestic policy was too\r\nfirmly established to be changed without a most serious revolution,\r\nought to have great weight with us in the adoption of any permanent\r\nsystem, speaks in this decided manner in his \"Wealth of Nations,\"\r\nvol. iii. p. 201. \"It is thus that every system which endeavours,\r\neither by extraordinary encouragements, to draw towards a particular\r\nspecies of industry a greater share of the capital of the society,\r\nthan what would naturally go to it; or by extraordinary restraints,\r\nto force from particular species of industry some share of the\r\ncapital which would otherwise be employed in it; is in reality\r\nsubversive of the great purpose which it means to promote. It\r\nretards instead of accelerating the progress of the society towards\r\nreal wealth and greatness; and diminishes instead of increasing\r\nthe real value of the annual produce of its land and labour. All\r\nsystems either of preference or restraint therefore, being thus\r\ncompletely taken away, the obvious and simple system of natural\r\nliberty establishes itself of its own accord. Every man, as long as\r\nhe does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free to\r\npursue his own interest his own way, and to bring both his industry\r\nand capital into competition with those of any other man or order of\r\nmen.\" M. Say, a man no less remarkable for his practical knowledge\r\nof manufacturing industry, than his profound acquaintance with every\r\nbranch of economical science, has given his marked disapprobation\r\nof that system which we are discussing. \"Lorsqu'au travers de cette\r\nmarche naturelle des choses,\" says he, \"l'autorité se montre et dit:\r\nle produit, qu'on veut créer, celui qui donne les meilleurs profits,\r\net par conséquent celui qui est le plus recherché, n'est pas celui\r\nqui convient, il faut qu'on s'occupe de tel autre; elle dirige\r\névidemment une partie de la production vers un genre, dont le besoin\r\nse fait sentir davantage.\" Traité d'Economic Politique, tom. i. p.\r\n168. We can only refer to pages 172 and 201 for the expansion of\r\nthese ideas. It is thus we find that the arguments adduced in favour\r\nof this system neither accord with the convictions of fact nor the\r\nsuggestions of reason. Whenever the increasing capital devoted to\r\nthe land can no longer be profitably employed, then manufactures\r\nwill flourish and the surplus profits of agriculture be legitimately\r\ndevoted to their support.\r\n\r\nDuring the late war, the prospect of large gains caused by the\r\nextravagant price of all European commodities, caused many persons\r\nin our country to embark their fortunes in cotton and woollen\r\nfactories.--These factories were brought into being by a temporary\r\nand unnatural state of things. On the return of the peace of 1814,\r\nmany of these manufacturing establishments came of necessity to an\r\nend. Some establishments remain and ought to succeed, because they\r\nprove that the profits of their capital may enter into competition\r\nwith that employed in agriculture. In this case the transfer is not\r\nonly natural but conducive to national wealth.\r\n\r\nBut we are asked to patronise manufactures at the expense of\r\nagriculture, on the ground of our being rendered really more\r\nindependent by them. This is, however, but an attempt to conceal\r\nprivate interest under the garb of patriotism,[5] and ought at least\r\nto awaken suspicion. We are not to be called _dependant_ merely\r\nbecause a state of war might give rise to many inconveniences. We\r\ncan do without silks or broadcloths while we possess the real means\r\nof sustenance and defence. But these factories once established,\r\nsay the advocates of this interest, the citizens ought to support\r\nthem in their present languishing condition, and therefore ought\r\nnot to buy, even at a much less price, foreign articles in\r\npreference to our own. The force and propriety of such reasoning\r\nwould appear to be similar to that of a gardener, who having in\r\nwinter devoted himself to the cultivation of flowers, &c., by means\r\nof artificial heat, should in the spring apply for an act of the\r\nmunicipal authority, forbidding all persons to pluck a daisy or\r\nviolet in the field, and requiring them to resort to his hot-house.\r\nSo far from there being a necessity for any interference on the\r\npart of government, we believe we may assert that our manufactures\r\nnever were so flourishing as since the peace. It is true that\r\nmany establishments have been broken up and much capital sunk,\r\nbut it is a fact that those factories which are in the hands of\r\nindividuals, have generally been successful, while those conducted\r\nby incorporated companies wanting the circumspection and prudence\r\nof private interest, have as often become bankrupt. In the western\r\nstates this branch of business has greatly improved, and recent\r\ninformation enables us to affirm, that the profits which are now\r\nrealised are nearly as large as those during the war. In the east,\r\nwe might cite an instance, which must put down all cavil on this\r\nsubject. The cotton factory at Waltham near Boston, begun when\r\nmanufactures were by no means in so promising a situation as at\r\npresent, is a triumphant answer to every one who demands additional\r\nencouragement for the loom, and a new tax on his brethren to extend\r\nits operations.\r\n\r\n  [5] \"Qui est-ce qui solicite des prohibitions ou de forts droits\r\n  d'entrée dans un état? ce sont les producteurs de la denrée dont il\r\n  s'agit de prohiber la concurrance, et non pas les consommateurs.\r\n  Ils disent, c'est pour l'intérêt de l'état; mais il est clair\r\n  que c'est pour le leur uniquement.--N'est-ce pas la même chose,\r\n  continuent-ils, et ce que nous gagnons n'est-il pas autant de\r\n  gagné pour notre pays? point de tout:--ce que vous gagnez de cette\r\n  manière est tiré de la poche de votre voisin, d'un habitant du même\r\n  pays; et si l'on pouvait compter l'excédant de dépense fait par les\r\n  consommateurs, en consequence de votre monopole, on trouverait qu'il\r\n  surpasse le gain que le monopole vous a valu.\" Traité d'Economie\r\n  Politique par Jean-Baptiste Say, tom. i. p. 203.\r\n\r\nBut we hasten to return from our wanderings, and to introduce our\r\nreaders to the work, of which we have prefixed the title to this\r\narticle. It is in the form of letters addressed to Professor Pictet\r\nof Geneva, from various places in Italy, and contains the author's\r\nremarks upon that country. He dwells not on the palaces of Venice,\r\nneither worships at the altar of Roman genius in the Pantheon,\r\nbut taking his silent way through the fields, he describes that\r\nwhich gave birth to both: he informs us of the processes of Italian\r\nfarming, of the effects of irrigation, and of the general state\r\nof Italian agriculture. And, in our opinion, he has shewn as much\r\ntaste in the execution of his design, as those travellers who have\r\nemployed themselves upon inquiries commonly thought as interesting,\r\nbut certainly not as useful. M. de Chateauvieux appears to be an\r\nenthusiastic admirer of the subject on which he writes, as well\r\nas to have a practical knowledge of all its details. His book is\r\nvery little known among us, though it has lately been translated\r\nin England, and formerly occupied the attention of a celebrated\r\ncritical journal of that country. It is our intention in this\r\narticle to put our readers in mind of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe author divides Italy into three regions, distinguished by\r\ntheir different systems of cultivation.--The first extends from\r\nmount Cenis and the Alps of Suza to the shores of the Adriatic.\r\nThe fertility of Lombardy is proved by the constant succession of\r\nits crops, and to this province he has given the name of \"Pays de\r\nCulture par assolement,\" or the district of culture by rotation of\r\ncrops. The second of the regions reposes on the southern declivity\r\nof the Appenines, from the frontiers of Provence to the boundaries\r\nof Calabria. This is called the District of Olive trees, or, by\r\nan association somewhat forced, of Canaanitish culture. The third\r\nregion is that of _Malaria_, or patriarchal cultivation, from a\r\nsupposed resemblance, which we are still less able to enter into,\r\nbetween the shepherds of the older and the present time. It is found\r\nfrom Pisa to Terracina, and comprehends the plain between the sea\r\nand the first ridge of the Appenines.\r\n\r\nLombardy has been often called the garden of Europe, and seems\r\nabundantly entitled to the appellation. The soil is not only rich\r\nand alluvial, but deep and perfectly level. The climate is humid,\r\nand the system of irrigation supplies water to almost every field.\r\nThese circumstances, united to the heat of a southern sun, cause a\r\nmost rapid and luxurious vegetation. Nothing can be more important\r\nin the economy of a farm than the situation of the farm-house\r\nand its out-buildings. In this respect our American farmers are\r\nlamentably deficient, and though we would not recommend as a model\r\nthe one described by de Chateauvieux as common in Lombardy, still we\r\nthink it would afford some valuable hints. The buildings raised on\r\nthe four sides of a square, present on one side a central elevation\r\nof two stories. The lower part for the farmer, the upper story for\r\nhis grain. Adjoining this, at each end, is a stable plastered so\r\nas not to let the dust descend, for the cows and oxen; the other\r\nthree sides of the square are enclosed by a sort of portico, open\r\nwithin and supported by columns, which serves as a depository for\r\nstraw, hay, &c.--This structure is about twenty-four feet broad, and\r\nfifteen high. Half the court is paved, the remainder is used for\r\nthreshing out the corn, which, in the primitive way, is still done\r\nby horses. The place for manure is outside of the court. This plan\r\npresents the most space with the least building, and assures the\r\npreservation of every product.\r\n\r\nThe farms in Lombardy are small, and do not often contain sixty\r\narpents;[6] notwithstanding M. de Chateauvieux asserts against\r\nArthur Young, that they bring more to market than the large farms,\r\nand that there is no country in the world which can dispose of so\r\nlarge a portion of its productions as Piedmont. If the fact be so,\r\nit may possibly arise from the peculiar character of the persons\r\nwho cultivate the land.--Our author, however, remarks, that this\r\nsystem of small farms can never take place till the advances of\r\ncapital have carried agriculture to its highest point. Lombardy is\r\ncultivated by a species of farmers, called _metayers_. They pay a\r\nsmall fixed rent, valued at one half the produce of the meadow,\r\nor forty francs the arpent. The clover belongs to them entirely;\r\nthe crops of wheat, Indian corn, and flax, and the wine and silk\r\nare equally divided between them and their landlord. The latter\r\nadvances nothing but the taxes, and of course must find such an\r\narrangement singularly advantageous. Father and son continue the\r\nsame engagement, without the formality of a lease or any registry\r\nof the contract. M. Say regards this system as unfavourable to\r\nagriculture, and in his treatise on Political Economy, book ii.\r\nchap. 9, vol. 2, says, \"il y a des cultivateurs qui n'ont rien, et\r\nauxquels le propriétaire fournit le capital avec la terre: on les\r\nappelle des Métayers. Ils rendent communément au propriétaire la\r\nmoitié du produit brut. Ce genre de culture appartient à un état peu\r\navancé de l'agriculture, et il est le plus défavorable de tout aux\r\naméliorations des terres; car celui des deux, du proprietaire ou du\r\nfermier, qui ferait l'améliarition à ses frais, admettrait l'autre à\r\njouir gratuitement de la moitié de l'interêt de ses avances.\"\r\n\r\n  [6] An arpent is to an acre nearly as five to four.\r\n\r\n(To be concluded in next Number.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SOUTHWICK,\r\n\r\nI have stated in my former communications, the result of my\r\nexperience in the cultivation of potatoes. So long as I practised\r\nsetting my crop with small potatoes, the cullings of my potato bins,\r\nmy crops degenerated, grew less and less for several years, and\r\nfinally run entirely out.--I changed my practice, and the result has\r\nbeen a continued improvement for near ten years, both in quantity\r\nand quality. My practice has been to select the largest, soundest,\r\nand best potatoes for seed, to cut them into 4 quarters, and plant\r\n4 pieces in each hill in a square of about 9 inches. The results\r\nhave been every way satisfactory. My potatoes have been large,\r\nconstantly improving in size, earlier, better, and more abundant\r\nfrom year to year. I have never been nice enough to weigh my seed,\r\nto ascertain exactly whether a potato of one ounce or two ounces be\r\nas perfect a root as one of 6 or 12 ounces. My experience both in\r\nplanting and in distillation has left on my mind a strong impression\r\nthat small unripe seed is very improper, and very unprofitable. I\r\nam aware that many farmers hold firmly that small seed potatoes are\r\nas good as large ones; but I also know that I have sold potatoes to\r\nthese men at 5 and 6 shillings per bushel, and some of them have\r\nbeen convinced that good seed was an object even at those prices.\r\nIn the south I am aware that it is the practice almost uniformly to\r\nplant small sweet potatoes. But I am fully persuaded it is an error.\r\nTo this cause I think may be justly attributed the decrease and\r\ndeterioration in the crops of this valuable root.\r\n\r\n_Middlesex, August 3, 1820._\r\n\r\n  [_Plough Boy._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMY IN FUEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile economy is the order of the day, it may not be amiss to point\r\nout an item of which it is believed a general ignorance prevails. It\r\nis well known to philosophers that when water commences to boil in\r\nthe open air no additional fire can make it any hotter. A contrary\r\nopinion prevails, and those employed in cooking victuals, in order\r\nto accelerate the operation think that they cannot make the fire\r\ntoo intense. The fuel added for this purpose is, in fact, not only\r\na wanton waste, but by causing a violent ebulition, it forces from\r\nthe victuals, with the steam its finest flavour. How much fuel in\r\nfamilies might be saved if, in cooking, no more were used than to\r\nkeep the water that is used just at the boiling point, and it is\r\ncertain the victuals would be the better for it.\r\n\r\n  [_Ib._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING CIDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Directions for making sweet, clear Cider, that shall retain its\r\n     fine vinous flavour, and keep good for a long time in casks,\r\n     like wine.\r\n\r\nIt is of importance in making cider, that the mill, the press, and\r\nall the materials be sweet and clean, and the straw clear from\r\nmust. To make good cider, fruit should be ripe, (but not rotten)\r\nand when the apples are ground, if the juice is left in the pummice\r\ntwenty-four hours, the cider will be richer, softer, and higher\r\ncoloured; if fruit is all of the same kind, it is generally thought\r\nthat the cider will be better; as the fermentation will certainly be\r\nmore regular, which is of importance. The gathering and grinding of\r\nthe apples, the pressing out of the juice, is a mere manual labour,\r\nperformed with very little skill in the operation; but here the\r\ngreat art of making good cider commences; for as soon as the juice\r\nis pressed out, nature begins to work a wonderful change in it.\r\nThe juice of fruit, if left to itself, will undergo three distinct\r\nfermentations, all of which change the quality and nature of this\r\nfluid. The first is the vinous; the second the acid, which makes it\r\nhard and prepares it for vinegar; by the third it becomes putrid.\r\nThe first fermentation is the only one the juice of apples should\r\nundergo, to make good cider. It is this operation that separates the\r\njuice from the filth, and leaves it a clear, sweet, vinous liquor.\r\nTo preserve it in this state is the grand secret; this is done by\r\nfumigating it with sulphur, which checks any further fermentation,\r\nand preserves it in its fine vinous state. It is to be wished that\r\nall cider makers would make a trial of this method; it is attended\r\nwith no expense, and but little trouble, and will have the desired\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nI would recommend that the juice as it comes from the press, be\r\nplaced in open headed casks or vats: in this situation it is most\r\nlikely to undergo a proper fermentation, and the person attending\r\nmay with correctness ascertain when this fermentation ceases; this\r\nis of great importance, and must be particularly attended to. The\r\nfermentation is attended with a hissing noise, bubbles rising to\r\nthe surface and there forming a soft spongy crust over the liquor.\r\nWhen this crust begins to crack, and white froth appears in the\r\ncracks level with the surface of the head, the fermentation is about\r\nstopping. At this time the liquor is in a fine, genuine, clear\r\nstate, and must be drawn off immediately into clean casks: and this\r\nis the time to fumigate it with sulphur. To do this, take a strip of\r\ncanvas or rag, about 2 inches broad and twelve long; dip this into\r\nmelted sulphur, and when a few pails of worked cider are put into\r\nthe cask, set this match on fire and hold it in the cask, till it\r\nis consumed, then bung the cask and shake it, that the liquor may\r\nincorporate with and retain the fumes; after this fill the cask and\r\nbung it up. The cider should be racked off again the latter part\r\nof February or first of March; and if not as clear as you wish it,\r\nput in isinglass to fine it, and stir it well; then put the cask\r\nin a cool place, where it will not be disturbed, for the fining to\r\nsettle. Cider prepared in this manner will keep sweet for years.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly of great importance to the people of America to\r\ncultivate the fruit that is natural to the soil of their country,\r\nand to make the most of the fruit which the soil produces;\r\nespecially, when its produce is an article of value and of great\r\nconsumption in this country.\r\n\r\n  A LOVER OF GOOD CIDER.\r\n\r\n_Am. D. Adv._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGES FOR CATTLE.\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving been in England, I have had an opportunity of observing many\r\nimprovements in agriculture, which, if I were to see them adopted\r\nhere, would give me the sincerest pleasure. Among the number of\r\nthem, I think the culture of cabbages for fattening of cattle stands\r\nin the first rank. From strong soils, it may fairly be questioned\r\nwhether any kind of winter provision can be raised of such weight\r\nand quality per acre, as the larger kind of cabbages. For cows, they\r\nsurpass all other kinds of vegetables, and probably some method may\r\nbe thought of, by which they may be conveniently preserved through\r\nour long winters. The colewort cabbage used to be in most esteem,\r\nbut I understand that a variety of the large red kind is coming into\r\nuse, and bids fair to drive out the Scotch drumhead, it being much\r\nmore hardy. They are exceedingly well adapted to wet land, and will\r\nprove very productive where turnips cannot be raised to any good\r\npurpose. It is, unquestionably, a crop of far more use and value\r\nthan the mangel wurzel, which has, in England, within these few\r\nyears, been in such fashionable culture.\r\n\r\nIn England and Scotland, I have seen the _parings of potatoes_\r\nplanted as seed; and at the same time I was told that they yielded\r\nquite as plentifully as cuttings with three eyes, or even whole\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nI never had an opportunity of witnessing the result, but it may be\r\nworth while for some experimental agriculturist to plant some in\r\nthis way, in order to prove or shew the fallacy of the assertion. I\r\nshould recommend that they cut the parings about two-tenths of an\r\ninch in thickness, as those parings which I saw planted always had\r\nthe eye left in them entire, and the root of the germ not in the\r\nleast wounded.\r\n\r\n  [_St. John's paper._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATE OF POMPEII.\r\n\r\nFrom William's Travels in Italy, Greece, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nPompeii, which was entombed in a softer substance, is getting\r\ndaily disencumbered, and a very considerable part of this Grecian\r\ncity is unveiled. We entered by the Appian way, through a narrow\r\nstreet of marble tombs, beautifully executed, with the names of\r\nthe deceased plain and legible. We looked into the columbary below\r\nthat of Marius Arius Diomedes, and perceived jars containing the\r\nashes of the dead, with a small lamp at the side of each. Arriving\r\nat the gate, we perceived a sentry box in which the skeleton of a\r\nsoldier was found with a lamp in its hand: proceeding up the street\r\nbeyond the gate, we went into several streets, and entered what\r\nis called a coffee house, the marks of cups being visible on the\r\nstone; we came likewise to a tavern, and found the sign (not a very\r\ndecent one) near the entrance. The streets are lined with public\r\nbuildings and private houses, most of which have their original\r\npainted decorations fresh and entire. The pavement of the streets\r\nis much worn by carriage wheels, and holes are cut through the side\r\nstones, for the purpose of fastening animals in the market place;\r\nand in certain situations are placed stepping stones, which give us\r\nrather unfavourable ideas of the state of the streets. We passed\r\ntwo beautiful little temples; went into a surgeon's house, in the\r\noperation room of which chirurgical instruments were found; entered\r\nan ironmonger's shop, where an anvil and hammer were discovered; a\r\nsculptor's and a baker's shop, in the latter of which may be seen\r\nan oven and grinding mills, like old Scotch querns. We examined\r\nlikewise an oilman's shop, and a wine shop lately opened, where\r\nmoney was found in the till; a school in which was a small pulpit\r\nwith steps up to it, in the middle of the apartment; a great\r\ntheatre; a temple of justice; an amphitheatre, about 220 feet in\r\nlength; various temples; a barrack for soldiers, the columns of\r\nwhich are scribbled with their names and jests; wells, cisterns,\r\nseats, tricliniums, beautiful Mosaic; altars, inscriptions,\r\nfragments of statues, and many other curious remains of antiquity.\r\nAmong the most remarkable objects were an ancient wall, with a part\r\nof a still more ancient marble freze built in it as a common stone;\r\nand a stream which has flowed under this once subterraneous city,\r\nlong before its burial; pipes of Terra Cotta to convey the water\r\nto the different streets; stocks for prisoners, in one of which a\r\nskeleton was found. All these things incline one almost to look for\r\nthe inhabitants, and wonder at the desolate silence of the place.\r\n\r\nThe houses in general are very low, and the rooms are small, I\r\nshould think not above ten feet high. Every house is provided with\r\na well and a cistern. Every thing seems to be in proportion; the\r\nprincipal streets do not appear to exceed 16 feet in width, with\r\nside pavements of about three feet; some of the subordinate streets\r\nare from 6 to 10 feet wide, with side pavements in proportion; these\r\nare occasionally high, and are reached by steps. The columns of\r\nthe barracks are about 15 feet in height; they are made of tuffa\r\nwith stucco; one third of the shaft is smoothly plastered, the rest\r\nfluted to the capital. The walls of the houses are often painted\r\nred, and some of them have borders and antique ornaments, masks,\r\nand imitations of marbles, but in general poorly executed. I have\r\nobserved, on the walls of an eating room, various kinds of food and\r\ngame tolerably represented; one _woman's_ apartment was adorned\r\nwith subjects relative to love; and a _man's_ with pictures of a\r\nmartial character. Considering that the whole has been under ground\r\nupwards of seventeen centuries, it is certainly surprizing that\r\nthey should be as fresh as at the period of their burial. The whole\r\nextent of the city, not half of which is excavated, may be about\r\nfour miles. It is said that Murat employed no less than 2000 men in\r\nclearing Pompeii, and that Madame Murat attended the excavations in\r\nperson every week. The present government have not retained above\r\n100.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting this extraordinary place, which certainly is the most\r\ninteresting of all the wonders of Naples, we examined the museum of\r\nantiquities at Purtici. The collections of ancient paintings are\r\ncurious and instructing, some of them containing exquisite pieces of\r\nart; one room is filled with representations of fruit and flowers,\r\nwell painted and freely handled; some grapes in particular are\r\nremarkable for execution, quite transparent, with the touches of\r\nlight on them judiciously placed to give effect and clearness. A\r\nsecond room contains various ornaments painted in a masterly manner,\r\nand with considerable ingenuity in the design. A third is covered\r\nwith various animals and birds. Another apartment is filled with\r\nlandscapes, but these are all extremely bad, having no perspective,\r\nnor any truth of colouring: indeed it would seem that the ancient\r\npainters had never given their mind to that delightful branch of\r\nthe art. One landscape, however, with all its faults, interested me\r\ngreatly, and that was a view of ancient Puteoli, (now Pozzuolo,)\r\nabout six miles from Naples, supposed to have been painted before\r\nSt. Paul landed there. The picture is, of course, very different\r\nfrom the present state of the city, but still a likeness may be\r\ntraced, if we keep in view the site of the various temples and other\r\nobjects, the foundations of which are still visible.\r\n\r\nAmong the innumerable pictures which are crowded in several rooms, I\r\nshall mention the following, which, on slight examination, appeared\r\nto be among the best: _Sophonisba drinking the juice of Hemlock_,\r\nadmirable in expression; _an Infant Hercules strangling Serpents_;\r\n_Jove_; _Leda and the Swan_; _the Graces_; _a Venus_; _Education\r\nof Bacchus_; _a Medusa's Head_:--these are all slight, but it is\r\nthat slightness which conveys character and refinement of taste; a\r\n_Theseus_ as large as life, in a fine attitude and good expression:\r\nTwo allegorical figures, representing the river _Nile and Egypt_;\r\n_the Education of Achilles_; _a beautiful Female suckling an\r\naged Man_, (corresponding to the Roman Charity,) most delicately\r\nexpressed: An _Academy of Music_, the figures small, exquisitely\r\npainted; harps and flageolets are the only instruments. Among the\r\ncurious pictures is the interior of a school, in which the master is\r\nrepresented flogging a boy, who is upon another boy's back; so that\r\nthe practice of _horsing_ is sanctioned by very ancient authority.\r\nOur attention was likewise attracted by a shoemaker's and a cook's\r\nshop; these last are but indifferently designed and painted; a\r\nWilkie or an Allan would smile at such productions. All these\r\nare in fresco, on stucco grounds, and with a considerable polish\r\non the surface. It does not seem that any glazing colours have\r\nbeen used, the effect being produced entirely by body colour. The\r\nancients, however, as Pliny informs us, had a dark, yet transparent\r\nmixture, which they laid over their highly finished works, to give\r\nthe delusion required. From the freshness and clearness of the\r\ncolouring, they seem to have had the advantage of painting in oil,\r\nso far, at least, as durability is of advantage.\r\n\r\nThe museum at Portici likewise contains many statues and busts of\r\nconsiderable merit; besides a great variety of culinary articles,\r\nand specimens, of calcined barley, beans, paste for bread, part\r\nof a roll, mustard-seed, straw, rye, pine tops, figs, cloth like\r\ntinder, fish nets, with corks attached to them, spunge, soap, rings,\r\nearrings, combs, thimbles, looking-glasses of polished metal, and\r\na variety of emblems of luxury and taste, admirably executed. We\r\nexamined them all with the keenest interest, though the impression\r\nwould have been more gratifying, had they been left in the ancient\r\ntowns in which they were discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Pennsylvania Gazette, Nov. 18, 1736.\r\n\r\nWASTE OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nBY. DR. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnergus was a gentleman of a good estate, he was bred to no\r\nbusiness, and could not contrive how to waste his hours agreeably;\r\nhe had no relish for any of the proper works of life, nor any taste\r\nat all for the improvements of the mind; he spent generally ten\r\nhours of the four and twenty in bed; he dozed away two or three\r\nmore on his couch, and as many were dissolved in good liquor every\r\nevening, if he met with company of his own humour. Five or six of\r\nthe rest he sauntered away with much indolence: the chief business\r\nof them was to contrive his meals, and to feed his fancy beforehand,\r\nwith the promise of a dinner and supper; not that he was so very a\r\nglutton, or so entirely devoted to appetite; but chiefly because he\r\nknew not how to employ his thoughts better, he let them rove about\r\nthe sustenance of his body. Thus he had made a shift to wear off\r\nten years since the paternal estate fell into his hands: and yet,\r\naccording to the abuse of words in our day, he was called a man of\r\nvirtue, because he was scarce ever known to be quite drunk, nor was\r\nhis nature much inclined to lewdness.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as he was musing alone, his thoughts happened to take\r\na most unusual turn, for they cast a glance backward, and began to\r\nreflect on his manner of life. He bethought himself what a number\r\nof living beings had been made a sacrifice to support his carcase,\r\nand how much corn and wine had been mingled with those offerings. He\r\nhad not quite lost all the arithmetic that he learned when he was\r\na boy, and he set himself to compute what he had devoured since he\r\ncame to the age of man.\r\n\r\n\"About a dozen feathered creatures, small and great, have one week\r\nwith another (said he) given up their lives to prolong mine, which\r\nin ten years amounts to at least six thousand.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty sheep have been sacrificed in a year, with half a hecatomb\r\nof black cattle, that I might have the choicest part offered weekly\r\nupon my table. Thus a thousand beasts out of the flock and the\r\nherd have been slain in ten years' time to feed me, besides what\r\nthe forest has supplied me with. Many hundreds of fishes have, in\r\nall their varieties, been robbed of life for my repast, and of the\r\nsmaller fry as many thousands.\r\n\r\n\"A measure of corn would hardly afford fine flour enough for a\r\nmonth's provision, and this arises to above six score bushels; and\r\nmany hogsheads of ale and wine, and other liquors, have passed\r\nthrough this body of mine, this wretched strainer of meat and drink.\r\n\r\n\"And what have I done all this time for God or _man_? What a vast\r\nprofusion of good things upon a useless life, and a worthless liver!\r\nThere is not the meanest creature among all these which I have\r\ndevoured, but hath answered the end of its creation better than I.\r\nIt was made to support human nature, and it hath done so. Every crab\r\nand oyster I have eat, and every grain of corn I have devoured, hath\r\nfilled up its place in the rank of beings with more propriety and\r\nhonour than I have done: O shameful waste of life and time!\"\r\n\r\nIn short, he carried on his moral reflections with so just and\r\nsevere a force of reason, as constrained him to change his whole\r\ncourse of life, to break off his follies at once, and to apply\r\nhimself to gain some useful knowledge, when he was more than thirty\r\nyears of age; he lived many following years with the character of\r\na worthy man, and an excellent Christian; he performed the kind\r\noffices of a good neighbour at home, and made a shining figure as a\r\npatriot in the senate-house; he died with a peaceful conscience, and\r\nthe tears of his country were dropped upon his tomb.\r\n\r\nThe world, that knew the whole series of his life, stood amazed at\r\nthe mighty change. They beheld him as a wonder of reformation, while\r\nhe himself confessed and adored the divine power and mercy, which\r\nhad transformed him from a brute to a man.\r\n\r\nBut this was a single instance; and we may almost venture to write\r\nMIRACLE upon it. Are there not numbers of both sexes among our young\r\ngentry, in this degenerate age, whose lives thus run to utter waste,\r\nwithout the least tendency to usefulness!\r\n\r\nWhen I meet with persons of such a worthless character as this, it\r\nbrings to my mind some scraps of Horace,\r\n\r\n    Nos numerus sumus, & fruges consumere nati.\r\n    ----Alcinoique Juventus\r\n    Cui pulchrum fuit in Medios dormire dies, &c.\r\n\r\nPARAPHRASE.\r\n\r\n    There are a number of us creep\r\n    Into this world, to eat and sleep;\r\n    And know no reason why they're born,\r\n    But merely to consume the corn,\r\n    Devour the cattle, fowl, and fish,\r\n    And leave behind an empty dish:\r\n    Though crows and ravens do the same,\r\n    Unlucky birds of hateful name;\r\n    Ravens or crows might fill their places,\r\n    And swallow corn and carcases.\r\n    Then, if their tombstone, when they die,\r\n    Ben't taught to flatter and to lie,\r\n    There's nothing better will be said,\r\n    _Than that they've eat up all their bread,  }\r\n    Drank all their drink, and gone to bed._    }\r\n\r\nThere are other fragments of that heathen poet, which occur on such\r\noccasions; one in the first of his satires, the other in the first\r\nof his epistles, which seem to represent life only as a season of\r\nluxury.\r\n\r\n    ----Exacto contentus tempore vitæ\r\n    Cedat uti convivia statur----\r\n    Lusisti satus, edisti satis atque babisti;\r\n    Tempus abire tibi.\r\n\r\nWhich may be thus put into English:\r\n\r\n    Life's but a feast; and when we die\r\n    Horace would say, if he were by,\r\n    Friend, thou hast eat and drank enough,\r\n    'Tis time now to be marching off:\r\n    Then like a well-fed guest depart,\r\n    With cheerful looks, and ease at heart;\r\n    Bid all your friends good night, and say,\r\n    _You've done the business of the day._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS ON THRIFT.\r\n\r\nPublished for general benefit, by a Member of the Save-all Club.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caprice of men at different periods has delighted to make much\r\nof some darling qualities idolized as virtues, while others, which\r\ncould not be mistaken for vices, have been tacitly scorned as only\r\nfit to occupy grovelling minds, and avert reproach from those who\r\ncould not aspire to praise.\r\n\r\nAmong the latter we discover Frugality. What writer has ever\r\nthought of making his hero an economist? With a disposition to\r\navoid unnecessary expense, it has long been assumed that a sordid\r\nand despicable parsimony must invariably be found, and the world\r\nhas been accustomed to bestow its tenderest sympathies on the gay,\r\nflorid, open-hearted rake, who having manifested a disposition to\r\ngive, where he had nothing of his own to bestow, ruined those honest\r\ntradesmen who were credulous enough to trust him, and qualified\r\nhimself for genteel society by visiting the King's Bench or the\r\nFleet; while the man who disdained to be generous at the expense\r\nof others, who would not affect splendour which his means were\r\ninadequate to sustain, in fine, who denied himself enjoyments for\r\nwhich he could not honestly pay, has been treated with unsparing\r\nridicule as a mean and pitiful plodder. Our citizens and traders\r\nhave wisely joined to laugh this character out of countenance, and\r\nto applaud the swindling pleasantries of a profligate. Let them look\r\nto the effects of this--let them look to their legers, and see if\r\nthey have not been merry _at their own expense_.\r\n\r\nIf there be any truth in the remark dropped by one of the greatest\r\nornaments of British literature, that \"it would be well if fewer\r\npossessed the superfluities, and more the comforts of life;\" in\r\ntimes like the present, it is desirable that mankind should be\r\nweaned from the admiration of that which ought never to have been\r\ndefended--that madness and dishonesty should no longer be depicted\r\nas the gracefully irregular flow of youthful gayety; and that the\r\nmodest virtues which find a friend in the author of \"Lessons on\r\nThrift,\" should be recalled from that exile to which they were\r\ndoomed by sordid dissipation and unreflecting folly.\r\n\r\nBut we must explain, as we proceed, to guard against mistake or\r\nrepresentation. We do not wish to return to that enviable state,\r\nwhich we suppose some of our radical neighbours contemplate, when\r\nthey talk of a \"state of nature;\" namely, that in which the first\r\ninhabitants of this island found themselves embowered in their\r\nnative woods. We do not sigh for that economical simplicity which,\r\naccording to Richard de Cirencester, made blue paint, applied to\r\nthe human body, a substitute for clothing; nor do we even lift\r\nour voices against that most effeminate piece of luxury, as it\r\nwas considered by some at the commencement of Queen Elizabeth's\r\nreign--the introduction of _chimneys to houses_. The votaries of\r\nluxury may think that, in the last instance, we make but a very\r\nslight concession; but the frightful effects of that departure\r\nfrom old English habits was once thought very alarming. We read\r\nin Hollingshed:--\"Now have we many chimneys; and yet our tender\r\nlimbs complain of rheums, catarrhs, and pozes; then had we none but\r\nreredosses, and our heads did never ache. For as the smoke in those\r\ndays was supposed to be a sufficient hardening for the timber of the\r\nhouse, so it was reputed a far better medicine to keep the good man\r\nand his family from the quack or poze, wherewith, as then, very few\r\nwere acquainted.\"\r\n\r\nWith all our reverence for economy, assuredly there are\r\npractitioners of the present day whom we would prefer to _Dr.\r\nSmoke_; even though calling in the former, we must submit to the\r\ninconvenience of offering a fee. We do not sigh for the return of\r\nthose golden days, when our wise progenitors made the same aperture\r\nact the double part of a window and a chimney, and when a log of\r\nwood was considered an excellent pillow; but sometimes when our\r\nreluctant hands are a little embarrassed to find the expected fee,\r\nor our purses feel most _awkwardly convenient_ for the pocket, after\r\nsettling the lengthened bill, we do regret that those who prescribe\r\nfor us, when indisposed, must at the same time prescribe for their\r\nown horses and carriages, and that the period is gone by when a\r\nsufferer could hope for relief from the pill of a pedestrian.\r\n\r\nOur author, to show the evil effects of luxury and extravagance,\r\neven in a national point of view, gives the following narrative:\r\n\r\n\"The Seven United Provinces were at the height of their power and\r\nprosperity about 1650, before England, recovering from a destructive\r\ncivil war, began to reclaim the dominion of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"But in their successful periods the private virtues had also their\r\nshare, and parsimony, as usual produced wealth and industry. In a\r\nconversation at Rotterdam this subject was discussed; and as the\r\nparties mostly imputed the decline of their republic to political\r\ncauses, an opulent merchant said, that if the company would dine\r\nwith him on such a day, he would convince them that there were other\r\ncauses more in their power.\r\n\r\n\"The invitation was accepted, and it was hoped that the merchant\r\nwould explain his sentiments, by which they might improve their\r\nspeculations in commerce over a glass of wine, after an elegant\r\nrepast as he was accustomed to give. But what was their surprise to\r\nfind nothing on the table but salted herrings and table beer! They\r\nate, however, a morsel in silence and dissatisfaction, which the\r\nmaster seemed not to observe, praying them repeatedly to eat and\r\npush the glass. At length, when they began to look at their watches,\r\nthe master ordered in the dinner. At this word they brightened up,\r\nwhen in came a leg of mutton, boiled with turnips, and a pot or two\r\nof strong beer. This dish was little more satisfactory than the\r\nother, as they expected very different fare in such a magnificent\r\nhouse. There was, however, a great sacrifice of conscience and\r\nveracity in praising the mutton and the beer. But some yawned,\r\nand half the _gigot_ remained even among a numerous company, when\r\nthe master, seeing their distress, nodded unnoticed to an old\r\nhoary-headed domestic, who alone had appeared along with the mutton,\r\nand who stood respectfully at the sideboard to serve the bread\r\nor the beer. He went out, and the company was left to a languid\r\nconversation; their eyes saying more than their tongues.\r\n\r\n\"On a sudden the folding doors opened, and a train of twelve\r\nservants entered, bearing on massy plate the choicest fish, flesh,\r\nfowl, all the delicacies of the season. Two without livery took\r\ntheir places behind their master; the others in splendid uniform\r\nbehind the guests. The number of wines presented was computed\r\nat fifteen, and even the richest guests were astonished at the\r\nsplendour and variety of the festival.\r\n\r\n\"When an equal dessert was served, and the wine began to circulate,\r\na prudent and wary guest thought it was time to request our opulent\r\nmerchant to explain his sentiments, as he had promised. All were\r\nfixed in mute attention when he made this memorable answer:\r\n'Gentlemen, my sentiments are already explained; the lesson is\r\nalready given. When our ancestors were gradually rising to wealth\r\nunder the yoke of Burgundy, Austria, Spain, their frugality was\r\ncontented with our first dish, and they even blessed the inventor.\r\nIn their second period, when the noble house of Orange, when Maurice\r\nof Nassau was establishing our power in the East and West Indies,\r\nand commercial wealth began to overflow all our ports and canals,\r\nstill habits of prudence occasioned economy, and our rich senators\r\ndined on plain mutton, and drank wholesome beer. The dinner I have\r\nhad the honour to give you is a very moderate specimen of our\r\npresent existence. Add the luxury and pomp of houses, furniture\r\nand equipages, and judge, as you well can, of the difference of\r\nexpense--a difference which, I would venture to say, would have,\r\neven for one year, been regarded as a fortune by our bearded\r\nancestors.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUTIES OF THE MICROSCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing can be more curious than the appearance exhibited by\r\n_mouldiness_, when viewed through a microscope. If looked at by the\r\nnaked eye, it seems nothing but an irregular tissue of filaments;\r\nbut the magnifying glass shows it to be a forest of small plants,\r\nwhich derive their nourishment from the moist substance which\r\nserves them as a base. The stems of these plants may be plainly\r\ndistinguish; and sometimes their buds, some shut and some open.\r\nThey have much similarity to mushrooms, the tops of which, when\r\nthey come to maturity, emit an exceedingly fine dust which is their\r\nseed. Mushrooms, it is well known, are the growth of a single\r\nnight; but those in miniature, of which we are speaking, seem to\r\ncome to perfection in a much less space of time than that; hence we\r\naccount for the extraordinary progress which mouldiness makes in a\r\nfew hours. Another curious observation of the same kind is, that\r\nM. Ahlefeld, seeing some stones covered with a sort of dust, had\r\nthe curiosity to examine it with a microscope, and he found that it\r\nconsisted of small microscopic mushrooms, raised on pedicles, the\r\nheads of which, round the middle, were turned up at the edges. They\r\nwere striated also from the centre to the circumference, as certain\r\nkinds of mushrooms are. He further remarked, that they contained,\r\nabove their upper covering, a multitude of small grains shaped like\r\ncherries somewhat flattened, which he suspected were the seeds; and\r\nfinally he observed, among the forest of mushrooms, several small\r\nred insects, which probably fed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe _lycoperdon_, or puff-ball, is a plant of the fungus kind, which\r\ngrows in the form of a tubercle, covered with small grains, very\r\nlike chagreen. If pressed, it bursts, and emits an exceedingly fine\r\nkind of dust, which flies off under the appearance of smoke. If some\r\nof the dust be examined with the microscope, it appears to consist\r\nof perfectly round globules, of an orange colour, the diameter of\r\nwhich is only about the 1-50th part of the thickness of a hair,\r\nso that each grain of this dust is but the 1-125000th part of a\r\nglobule, equal in diameter to the breadth of a hair.\r\n\r\nThe _farina of flowers_ is found to be regularly and uniformly\r\norganized in each kind of plant. In the mallow, for example, each\r\ngrain is an opaque ball, covered over with small points. The farina\r\nof the tulip, and of most of the liliaceous kind of flowers, bears a\r\nstriking resemblance to the seeds of a cucumber: that of the poppy\r\nis very like grains of barley, with a longitudinal groove in them.\r\n\r\nThere are certain plants, the leaves of which seem to be pierced\r\nwith a multitude of small holes. Of this kind is the _hypericum_, or\r\nSt. John's wort. Now, if a fragment of this be viewed with a good\r\nmicroscope, the supposed holes are found to be vesicles, contained\r\nin the thickness of the leaf, and covered with an extremely thin\r\nmembrane; and these are thought to be the receptacles which contain\r\nthe essential and aromatic oil peculiar to the plant.\r\n\r\nThe view exhibited by those plants which have down, such as borage,\r\nnettles, &c. is exceedingly curious.--When examined by a microscope,\r\nthey appear to be covered with spikes. Those of borage are, for\r\nthe most part, bent so as to form an elbow; and though really very\r\nclose, they appear by the microscope, to be at a considerable\r\ndistance from each other. The entire appearance is very similar to\r\nthat of the skin of the porcupine.\r\n\r\nIf a needle be viewed through a microscope, though exceedingly fine,\r\nit is well known the point will appear quite blunt, more like a peg,\r\nbroken at the end, than a sharp pointed steel needle. The edge of\r\nthe finest set razor, when seen through a microscope, will appear\r\nmore like the back of a penknife, full of irregularities, than what\r\nit really is. In these respects the works of art, when carried to\r\nthe highest pitch of perfection, will not bear to be compared with\r\nthe operations of nature. The latter, exposed to the microscope,\r\ninstead of losing their lustre and high polish, appear so much the\r\nmore beautiful and perfect in regularity and order. When the eyes\r\nof a fly are illuminated by means of a lamp or candle, and viewed\r\nthrough this instrument, each of them shows an image of the taper\r\nwith a precision and vivacity which nothing can equal.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of _sand_, viz. the calcareous and the\r\nvitrifiable: the former, examined with a microscope, resembles\r\nlarge irregular fragments of rock; but the latter appears like so\r\nmany rough diamonds. In some instances, the particles of sand seem\r\nto be highly polished and brilliant, like an assemblage of diamonds,\r\nrubies, and emeralds.\r\n\r\nCharcoal is a fine object for the microscope. It is found full of\r\npores, regularly arranged, and passing through its whole length.\r\n\r\n  [_English Magazine._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following melancholy letter alludes to Accum's \"Treatise on\r\nAdulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER\r\n\r\n_From an elderly Gentlewoman to Mr. Christopher North._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. North--I much fear that this is the last letter you\r\nwill ever receive from your old friend. \"I'm wearin' awa, Kit!\r\nto the land o' the leal!\" and that, too, under the influence\r\nof a complication of disorders, which have been undermining my\r\nconstitution (originally a sound and stout one) for upwards of half\r\na century. Look to yourself my much respected lad--and think no more\r\nof your rheumatism. That, believe me, is a mere trifle; but think\r\nof what you have been doing, since the peace of 1763, (in that year\r\nwere you born,) in the eating and drinking way, and tremble. I know,\r\nmy dear Kit, that you never were a gormandizer, nor a sot; neither\r\nsurely was I--but it matters not--the most abstemious of us all\r\nhave gone through fearful trials, and I have not skill in figures\r\nto cast up the poisonous contents of my hapless stomach for nearly\r\nthreescore years. You would not know me now; I had not the slightest\r\nsuspicion of myself in the looking-glass this morning. Such a face!\r\nso wan and wobegone! No such person drew Priam's curtains at dead of\r\nnight, or could have told him half his Troy was burned.\r\n\r\nWell--hear me come to the point. I remember now, perfectly well,\r\nthat I have been out of sorts all my lifetime; and the causes\r\nof my continual illness have this day been revealed to me. May\r\nmy melancholy fate be a warning to you, and all your clear\r\ncontributors, a set of men whom the world could ill spare at this\r\ncrisis. Mr. Editor--I HAVE BEEN POISONED.\r\n\r\nYou must know that I became personally acquainted a few weeks ago,\r\nquite accidentally, with that distinguished chymist, well known in\r\nour metropolis by the name of \"Death in the Pot.\"[7] He volunteered\r\na visit to me at breakfast, last Thursday, and I accepted him. Just\r\nas I had poured out the first cup of tea, and was extending it\r\ngraciously towards him, he looked at me, and with a low, hoarse,\r\nhusky voice, like Mr. Kean's, asked me if I were not excessively\r\nill? I had not had the least suspicion of being so--but there was\r\na terrible something in \"Death in the Pot's\" face which told me I\r\nwas a dead woman. I immediately got up--I mean strove to get up, to\r\nring the bell for a clergyman--but I fainted away. On awaking from\r\nmy swoon, I beheld \"Death in the Pot\" still staring with his fateful\r\neyes--and croaking out, half in soliloquy, half in tête-a-tête,\r\n\"There is not a life in London worth ten year's purchase.\" I\r\nimplored him to speak plainly, and for God's sake not to look at\r\nme so malagrugorously--and plainly enough he did then speak to be\r\nsure--\"Mrs. TROLLOPE, YOU ARE POISONED.\"\r\n\r\n  [7] Frederick Accum, Operative Chymist, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Who,\" cried I out convulsively, \"who has perpetrated the foul\r\ndeed? On whose guilty head will lie my innocent blood? Has it been\r\nfrom motives of private revenge? Speak, Mr. Accum[8]--speak! Have\r\nyou any proofs of a conspiracy?\" \"Yes, Madam, I have proofs,\r\ndamning proofs. Your wine merchant, your brewer, your baker, your\r\nconfectioner, your grocer, aye, your very butcher, are in league\r\nagainst you; and, Mrs. Trollope, YOU ARE POISONED!\"--\"When!--Oh!\r\nwhen was the fatal dose administered? Would an emetic be of no\r\navail? Could you not yet administer a----\" But here my voice was\r\nchoked, and nothing was audible, Mr. North, but the sighs and sobs\r\nof your poor Trollope.\r\n\r\n  [8] Death in the Pot.\r\n\r\nAt last I became more composed--and Mr. Accum asked me what was, in\r\ngeneral, the first thing I did on rising from bed in the morning.\r\nAlas! I felt that it was no time for delicacy, and I told him at\r\nonce, that it was to take off a bumper of brandy for a complaint\r\nin my stomach. He asked to look at the bottle. I brought it forth\r\nfrom the press in my own number, that tall square tower-like bottle,\r\nMr. North, so green to the eye and smooth to the grasp. You know\r\nthe bottle well--it belonged to my mother before me. He put it to\r\nhis nose--he poured out a driblet into a teaspoon as cautiously as\r\nif it had been the black drop--he tasted it--and again repeated\r\nthese terrible words, \"Mrs. TROLLOPE, YOU ARE POISONED. It has,\"\r\nhe continued, \"a peculiar disagreeable smell, like the breath of\r\nhabitual drunkards.\" \"Oh! thought I, has it come to this! The smell\r\never seemed to my unsuspecting soul most fragrant and delicious.\"\r\n\"Death in the Pot\" then told me, that the liquid I had been\r\ninnocently drinking every morn for thirty years was not brandy at\r\nall, but a vile distillation of British molasses over wine lees,\r\nrectified over quick lime, and mixed with saw-dust. And this a sad,\r\nsolitary, unsuspecting spinster had been imbibing as brandy for so\r\nmany years! A gleam of comfort now shot across my brain--I told\r\nMr. Accum that I had, during my whole life, been in the habit of\r\ntaking a smallish glass of Hollands before going to bed, which I\r\nfain hoped might have the effect of counteracting the bad effects\r\nof the forgery that had been committed against me. I produced the\r\nbottle--the white globular one you know. \"Death in the Pot\" tried\r\nand tasted--and alas! instead of Hollands, pronounced it vile\r\nBritish malt spirit, fined by a solution of sub-acetate of lead, and\r\nthen a solution of alum--and strengthened with grains of paradise,\r\nGuinea pepper, capsicum, and other acrid and aromatic substances.\r\nThese are learned words--but they made a terrible impression upon\r\nmy memory. Mr. Accum is a most amiable man, I well believe--but he\r\nis a stranger to pity. \"Mrs. Trollope, YOU HAVE BEEN POISONED,\" was\r\nall he would utter. Had the brandy and Hollands been genuine, there\r\nwould have been no harm--but they were _imitation_, and \"YOU ARE\r\nPOISONED.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling myself very faint, I asked, naturally enough for a woman in\r\nmy situation, for a glass of wine. It was brought--but Mr. Accum was\r\nat hand to snatch the deadly draught from my lips. He tasted what\r\nused to be called my genuine old port,\r\n\r\n    \"And in the scowl of heaven his face,\r\n    Grew black as he was sipping.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is spoiled elder wine--rendered astringent by oak-wood,\r\nsaw-dust, and the husks of filberts--lead and arsenic, madam,\r\nare----\" but my ears tingled, and I heard no more. I confessed to\r\nthe amount of six glasses a day of this hellish liquor--pardon my\r\nwarmth--and that such had been my allowance for many years. My\r\nthirst was now intolerable, and I beseeched a glass of beer. It\r\ncame, and \"Death in the Pot\" detected at once the murderous designs\r\nof the brewer. Coculus indicus, Spanish juice, hartshorn shavings,\r\norange powder, copperas, opium, tobacco, nux vomica--such were the\r\nshocking words he kept repeating to himself--and then again, \"Mrs.\r\nTROLLOPE IS POISONED.\"--\"May I not have a single cup of tea, Mr.\r\nAccum,\" I asked imploringly, and the chymist shook his head. He\r\nthen opened the tea-caddy, and emptying its contents, rubbed my\r\nbest green tea between his hard horny palms. \"Sloe-leaves, and\r\nwhite-thorn leaves, madam, coloured with Dutch pink, and with the\r\nfine green bloom of verdigris! Much, in the course of your regular\r\nlife, you must have swallowed!\" \"Might I try the coffee?\" Oh! Mr.\r\nNorth, Mr. North, you know my age, and never once, during my whole\r\nexistence, have I tasted coffee. I have been deluded by pease and\r\nbeans, sand, gravel, and vegetable powder! Mr. Accum called it\r\nsham coffee, most infamous stuff, and unfit for human food! Alas!\r\nthe day that I was born! In despair I asked for a glass of water,\r\nand just as the sparkling beverage was about to touch my pale\r\nquivering lips, my friend, for I must call him so in spite of every\r\nthing, interfered, and tasting it, squirted out of his mouth, with\r\na most alarming countenance. \"It comes out of a lead cistern--it\r\nis a deadly poison.\" Here I threw myself on my knees before this\r\ninexorable man, and cried, \"Mr. Death in the Pot, is there in\r\nheaven, on earth, or the waters under the earth, any one particle of\r\nmatter that is not impregnated with death? What means this desperate\r\nmockery? For mercy's sake give me the very smallest piece of bread\r\nand cheese, or I can support myself no longer. Are we, or are we\r\nnot, to have a morsel of breakfast this day?\" He cut off about an\r\ninch long piece of cheese from that identical double Gloucester that\r\nyou yourself, Mr. North, chose for me, on your last visit to London,\r\nand declared that it had been rendered most poisonous by the anotta\r\nused to colour it. \"There is here, Mrs. Trollope, a quantity of\r\nred lead--Have you, madam, never experienced after devouring half\r\na pound of this cheese, an indescribable pain in the region of the\r\nabdomen and of the stomach, accompanied with a feeling of tension,\r\nwhich occasioned much restlessness, anxiety, and repugnance to food?\r\nHave you never felt, after a Welsh rabbit of it, a very violent\r\ncholic?\" \"Yes! yes!--often, often!\" I exclaimed. \"And did you use\r\npepper and mustard?\" \"I did even so.\" \"Let me see the castors.\" I\r\nrose from my knees--and brought them out. He puffed out a little\r\npepper into the palm of his hand, and went on as usual. \"This,\r\nmadam, is spurious pepper altogether--it is made up of oil cakes,\r\n(the residue of linseed, from which the oil has been pressed,)\r\ncommon clay, and, perhaps, a small portion of Cayenne pepper,\r\n(itself probably artificial or adulterated,) to make it pungent. But\r\nnow for the mustard\"--at this juncture the servant maid came in, and\r\nI told her that I was poisoned--she set up a prodigious scream, and\r\nMr. Accum let fall the mustard pot on the carpet. But it is needless\r\nfor me to prolong the shocking narrative. They assisted me to get\r\ninto bed, from which I never more expect to rise. My eyes have been\r\nopened, and I see the horrors of my situation. I now remember the\r\nmost excruciating cholic, and divers other pangs which I thought\r\nnothing of at the time, but which must have been the effect of the\r\ndeleterious solids and liquids which I was daily introducing into\r\nmy stomach.--It appears that I have never, so much as once, either\r\neat or drank a real thing--that is, a thing being what it pretended\r\nto be. Oh! the weight of lead and copper that has passed thro' my\r\nbody! Oh! too, the gravel and the sand! But is impossible to deceive\r\nme now. This very evening some bread was brought to me--Bread! I\r\ncried out indignantly--Take the vile deception out of my sight.\r\nYes, my dear Kit, it was a villanous loaf of clay and alum! But\r\nmy resolution is fixed, and I hope to die in peace. Henceforth, I\r\nshall not allow one particle of matter to descend into my stomach!\r\nAlready I feel myself \"of the earth, earthy.\"--Mr. Accum seldom\r\nleaves my bedside--and yesterday brought with him several eatables\r\nand drinkables, which he assured me he had analyzed, subjected to\r\nthe test-act, and found them to be conformists. But I have no trust\r\nin chymistry. His quarter-loaf looked like a chip cut off the corner\r\nof a stone block. It was a manifest _sham loaf_. After being deluded\r\nin my Hollands, bit in my brandy, and having found my muffins a\r\nmockery, never more shall I be thrown off my guard. I am waxing\r\nweaker and weaker--so farewell!

For my own satisfaction, I have\r\nfor some years past been endeavouring to ascertain the truth of the\r\nfact, and my observations for the last ten years past require only\r\n20' to be added to strike the former object. It is well known that\r\nformerly surveyors made an allowance to the west or left hand, of\r\none degree, for every 10 or 11 years for variation, and it now comes\r\nshort 40' of the common allowance, so that from the result of my\r\nobservations it appears evidently that the variation is not on the\r\nreturn, but still increasing, but so slow and variable every year,\r\nthat it cannot be ascertained, unless by a series of experiments. To\r\ncorroborate the following observations, I would remark, that I have\r\nlately read (I think in the Encyclopædia) of a curious gentlemen in\r\nLondon, who with a nice instrument, monthly for a number of years,\r\nmade observations upon the variation, and he seldom found the needle\r\ncut the same degree and minutes, but varying sometimes to the right,\r\nothers to the left: sometimes more, sometimes less, which shows that\r\nthe attractive power is variable.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of July, 1810, an object on the North mountain, 3 and a\r\nhalf miles off, bore\r\n\r\n                    N. 61° 00' W.\r\n\r\n  8th July, 1811, the same\r\n  object bore          60  50\r\n\r\n  14th July, 1812, do. 60  50\r\n\r\n  10th July, 1813, do. 60  50\r\n\r\n  8th July, 1814, do.  61  10\r\n\r\n  12th July, 1815, do. 61  15\r\n\r\n  13th July, 1816, do. 61  15\r\n\r\n  15th July, 1817, do. 61  15\r\n\r\n  14th July, 1818, do. 61  30\r\n\r\n  15th July, 1819, do. 61  25\r\n\r\n  10th July, 1820, do. 61  20\r\n\r\nFrom whatever cause the variation of the needle arises, it evidently\r\nis affected by a something within our earth; but whether from the\r\nmotion of two attractive poles, or four, as has been maintained by\r\ngreat men, or whether by a concentric globe of elementary particles\r\ncomposed of electricity and refined iron, adjusted and organized\r\nin a particular way, are all hypotheses. The phenomenon of the\r\ndipping needle is a curiosity, and sufficient to satisfy us that\r\nthe power of attraction is about the centre of the earth, for let\r\na needle be truly balanced on a centre pin in our latitude, then\r\ngive it the polarity necessary, the north end will dip about fifty\r\ndegrees;--move it to the equator it will become again level;--carry\r\nit still southward, the south end will dip.\r\n\r\nWhen effects are obvious, man more curious than wise,\r\nendeavours to search out the cause, and in some things we may\r\nbe successful,--others are beyond our knowledge, and hid in the\r\nmysteries of Nature's God.\r\n\r\n  JOHN KING.\r\n\r\n_Mercersburgh, (Penn.)_ } _July 18, 1820._ }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE MORALITY OF DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN ENGLAND AND WALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following interesting table is copied from Mr. Myers' \"New\r\nSystem of Geography,\" a work now publishing in monthly parts, and\r\nwhich, from the manner of its execution, promises to supply an\r\nimportant desideratum, in that branch of literature, created by the\r\nrecent political changes upon the continent of Europe.\r\n\r\n     A Table, showing the proportion which the number of persons\r\n     committed to prison in each county of England and Wales, bears\r\n     to the whole population; and thus illustrating the influence of\r\n     local circumstances on the morals of the people.

In Dieppe, every\r\nvariety of shop and trade had a woman assisting in it, who, from her\r\nappearance, might generally be considered as the mistress of the\r\nfamily. At a blacksmith's shop, for instance, I saw a neatly dressed\r\nwoman, with a very clean cap shoeing a horse; and, passing a second\r\ntime, I saw her filing at a vice. I expressed my astonishment to the\r\nneighbours, but they seemed rather disposed to laugh at me, than\r\nto join in my laugh at the woman. I learnt that she was a widow,\r\nand thus kept up her husband's trade, to rear a large family. In\r\nParis, I complimented a pretty wife of an eminent bookseller for\r\nher knowledge of the prices of paper, printing, and engraving, in\r\nwhich she several times corrected errors of her husband. I remarked,\r\nthat the French ladies must have great talents thus to learn a\r\ntrade in the honey moon, which had employed their husbands during\r\nan apprenticeship of seven years; and that I supposed she would be\r\nequally expert at any other trade, if, on becoming a widow, she\r\nmarried a husband in some other line. \"Ah! Monsieur,\" said she, \"we\r\nendeavour to assist our spouses in every way in our power;--it is\r\nour only pleasure; their cares are our cares, and their interests\r\nare ours; and, if it is our calamity to become widows, and we meet\r\nwith another good husband, we do the best we can for him also.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy\r\ndies; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate\r\ndesire forsakes me; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a\r\ntombstone, my heart melts with compassion; when I see the tombs of\r\nthe parents themselves, I feel how vain it is to grieve for those\r\nwhom we must quickly follow; when I behold rival kings lying side by\r\nside, or the holy men who divided the world with their contests and\r\ndisputes, I reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the frivolous\r\ncompetitions, factions, and debates of mankind; when I read the\r\nseveral dates of the tombs,--of some who died yesterday, and some\r\nsix hundred years ago, I am reminded of that day when all mankind\r\nwill be contemporaries, and make their appearance together.\r\n\r\n  ADDISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF EUROPE.\r\n\r\nFrom a French paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nEurope contains in superfices, 153,559 square geographic miles,\r\nof 15 to a degree, or only 1116 of the continental superfices\r\nof the whole earth. Its population is estimated at 180 millions\r\nand a half; which gives, one with another, 1177 inhabitants to\r\neach square geographic mile. It should always be remembered, that\r\nthis population is very unequally divided; for if in the lowest\r\ncountries, for example, we reckon 4550 inhabitants to a square mile,\r\nRussia contains but 447; Sweden, 362; and Norway only 118.\r\n\r\nEurope contains 17 nations: 1st nations, speaking the dialect\r\nderived from the Latin language, 61 millions; 2d, Teutonic nations,\r\n54 millions; 3d, Sclavonian, 46 millions; 4th, Celts, 3,720,000;\r\n5th, Tartars, 3,500,000; 6th, Magvans, 5,250,000; 7th, Greeks,\r\n2,100,000; 8th, Finns, 1,800,000; 9th, Cimmerians, 1,610,000; 10th,\r\nBasques, 630,000; 11h, Arnauts, 300,000; 12th, Maltese, 80,000;\r\n13th, Circassians, 8,000; 14th, Samoides, 2,100; 15th, Jews,\r\n2,660,000; 16th, Gipsies, 340,000; and 17th, Armenians, 150,000.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholics are in number about 100 millions; the\r\nProtestants of different communions about 42 millions; the\r\nschismatic Greeks, 32 millions; the Mennonists 240,000; the\r\nMethodists 190,000; the Unitarians 50,000; the Quakers 40,000; the\r\nMohammedans 2,630,000; the Jews 2,600,000; and the Herrnhutters\r\n(Moravians) 40,000.\r\n\r\nIn classing out each state according to its superfices, its\r\npopulation, its ordinary revenues, and the contributive proportion\r\nof each individual towards the public burdens, we find that they\r\nshould occupy the following order.\r\n\r\n_Superfices._--1st, Russia; 2d, Sweden; 3d, Austria; 4th, France;\r\n5th, Turkey; 6th, Spain; 7th, Great Britain; 8th, Prussia; 9th,\r\nGermany; 10th, Denmark; 11th, the Two Sicilies; 12th, Portugal;\r\n13th, Sardinia; 14th, the Netherlands; 15th, Switzerland; 16th, the\r\nEcclesiastical States; and 17th, Tuscany, &c.\r\n\r\n_Population._--1st, Russia; second, France; 3d, Austria; 4th, Great\r\nBritain; 5th, Germany; 6th, Spain; 7th, Prussia; 8th, Turkey; 9th,\r\nthe Two Sicilies; 10th, the Netherlands; 11th, Sardinia; 12th,\r\nPortugal; 13th, Sweden; 14th, the Ecclesiastial States; 15th,\r\nSwitzerland; 16th, Denmark; 17th, Tuscany, &c.\r\n\r\n_Revenue._--1st, Great Britain; 2d, France; 3d, Russia; 4th,\r\nAustria; 5th, Germany; 6th, the Netherlands; 7th, Prussia; 8th,\r\nSpain; 9th, Turkey; 10th, Portugal; 11th, the Two Sicilies; 12th,\r\nSardinia; 13th, Sweden; 14th, Denmark; 15th, the Ecclesiastical\r\nStates; 16th, Tuscany; and 17th, Switzerland, &c.\r\n\r\n_Contributive Portion on each Individual towards the public\r\ncharges._---This last calculation is the most curious. It\r\ndemonstrates what each individual pays annually one with\r\nanother,--namely, in England, 52f. 5c.; in the Netherlands, 38f.\r\n5c.; in France, 19f. 71c.; in Germany, 16f. 6c.; in Russia, 15f.\r\n88c.; in Denmark, 14f 60c; Portugal, 13f. 85c.; in Spain, 17f. 60c;\r\nin Sardinia, 12f. 5c; in Austria, 11f. 68c.; in the Ecclesiastical\r\nStates, 9f. 40c. in Sweden, 9f. 31c. in Tuscany, 9f. 12c; in Turkey,\r\n9f. 4c.; in the Two Sicilies, 7f. 97c.; and in Switzerland, 5f. 47c.\r\nThis last is the weakest of all European states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mode of engraving union steel and then transferring the same to\r\nsteel or other metals._--This invention deservedly demands while\r\nit receives the admiration of every lover of the Fine Arts; and\r\nat the same time it presents the means of perpetuating whatever\r\nis beautiful in the art of engraving, and will probably produce\r\na general refinement in the state of the public by furnishing\r\nengravings of the most beautiful kinds, at the same cost as those of\r\ninferior execution.\r\n\r\nThis invention promises to be of great advantage to some of our\r\nmanufacturers, particularly that of pottery, which may now be\r\nembellished with beautiful engravings, so as to place the successful\r\ncompetition of other nations at a more distant period. It may also\r\nbe applied with great advantage to _calico_ printing, by producing\r\nentire new patterns upon the cylinders from which they are printed,\r\nan object of great importance to our manufacturing interest. These\r\nare among its obvious applications; but as a means of rendering\r\nforgery _impracticable_, it claims the attention of statesmen and\r\nthe gratitude of philanthropists, who shudder at the hundreds of\r\nvictims which are now immolated to the laws by the facility with\r\nwhich they may be violated.\r\n\r\nThe association of Mr. Charles Heath with the American inventors is\r\na fortunate circumstance, as it affords a pledge, that all which\r\nis exquisite in art will be combined with the ingenious mechanical\r\ninventions of Mr. Perkins, and the perseverance of Mr. Fairman;\r\nand the means of conferring every desirable perfection on various\r\napplications of the Siderographic process.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Britain and the U. States._--(A Contrast.)--A correspondent\r\nobserves, that from an article in the last Inquirer, taken from a\r\nLondon paper, it is computed that the expense of the approaching\r\ncoronation of his Britannic Majesty, George IV., will exceed eight\r\nhundred thousand pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nThis, at $4 44 cents the pound sterling, amounts to the moderate sum\r\nof three millions five hundred and fifty two thousand dollars, of\r\nthe currency of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis sum would pay the salaries of the President of the U. States\r\nfor a succession of _one hundred and forty-two years_,--and leave a\r\nbalance of two thousand dollars remaining.\r\n\r\n  [_Richmond Com._\r\n\r\n\r\n_English Churn._--An improvement has been made in England in the\r\nconstruction of the dasher of the churn, which \"is made to turn on\r\na pivot, fixed in the lower end of the handle, and consists of two\r\npieces set crosswise, so as to form four wings, diagonally shaped,\r\nand something similar to those of a windmill. Let the wings be about\r\ntwo inches wide, proportioned in length to the dimensions of the\r\nchurn, and of such a level as gives them an inclination of about\r\nforty-five degrees.\r\n\r\nThe pivot on which the wings turn to be of iron, otherwise it will\r\nsoon wear out.\"\r\n\r\nThe above plan is more efficacious than any other, and requires the\r\noperation to be moderately performed lest the butter come too soon,\r\nand therefore become swetted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Watermelon Sirup._--Those of our readers who may not be acquainted\r\nwith the fact, but yet are friendly to domestic economy, are\r\ninformed, that one gallon of watermelon-juice will, by boiling,\r\nafford one pint of pure sirup, preferable either to honey or\r\nmolasses, for domestic or medical purposes. The trial is easily\r\nmade, and the expense trifling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Patent Churn._--A churn has been invented by a young man in\r\nVermont, which answers every purpose with a very trifling labour. It\r\nstands perpendicularly, and is perfectly tight.--The operation is\r\nperformed by a person sitting near the churn and working the machine\r\nby each hand, as you work a pump. The dasher is turned by means of\r\ntwo leather straps, which are fastened at one end of the upright\r\ncylinder, and passing each once round it in opposite directions, are\r\nfastened at the other end of the handle on each side of the upright.\r\nSo that the stroke with one hand turns the dasher once round, and\r\nthat with the other turns it back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Socrates._--One day when Alcibiades was boasting of his wealth\r\nand the great estates in his possession, (which generally blow\r\nup the pride of young people of quality,) Socrates carried him\r\nto a geographical map, and asked him to find Attica. It was so\r\nsmall, it could scarcely be discerned upon the draft; he found it,\r\nhowever, though with some difficulty. But, upon being desired to\r\npoint out his own estate there--\"It is too small,\" says he, \"to be\r\ndistinguished in so little a space.\"\r\n\r\n\"See then,\" replied Socrates, \"how much you are affected about an\r\nimperceptible point of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Georgetown, (Ky.) August 3._--A white crow was lately shot by\r\nCol. Rhodes Thompson, at his residence, on Elkhorn, about two and\r\na half miles from this town. It was examined by several scientific\r\ngentlemen, and pronounced to be of the crow species; it resembled\r\nthe common black crow in every thing but its colour, which was of a\r\ndingy white.--Col. Thompson had observed it for some time among a\r\nflock of black crows, and had ascertained its note to be the same as\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scotch Adventurers._--The character which the Scotch have acquired,\r\nbeyond almost any other people, for the art of pushing their fortune\r\nabroad, was never perhaps more singularly illustrated than by the\r\nfollowing anecdote, which Dr. Anderson relates in his \"Bee,\" on the\r\nauthority of a baronet of scientific eminence.\r\n\r\nThe Russians and Turks, in the war of 1739, having diverted\r\nthemselves long enough in the contest, agreed to treat for peace.\r\nThe commisioners, for this purpose, were marshal Gen. Keith, on\r\nthe part of Russia, and the grand vizier on that of the Turks.\r\nThese personages met, and carried on their negotiations by means\r\nof interpreters. When all was concluded, they rose to separate:\r\nthe marshal made his bow, with his hat in his hand, and the vizier\r\nhis salam, with his turban on his head. But when these ceremonies\r\nof taking leave were over, the vizier turned suddenly, and coming\r\nup to marshal Keith, took him cordially by the hand, and in the\r\nbroadest Scotch dialect, declared warmly that it made him \"unco\r\nhappy to meet a countryman in his exalted station.\" Keith started\r\nwith astonishment, eager for an explanation of the mystery, when\r\nthe vizier added, \"Dinna be surprised, mon, I'm o' the same country\r\nwi' yoursel'. I mind weel seeing you and your brother, when boys,\r\npassin by to the school at Kirkaldy; my father, Sir, was _bellman\r\nof Kirkaldy_.\" What more extraordinary can be imagined, than to\r\nbehold in the plenipotentiaries of two mighty nations, two foreign\r\nadventurers, natives of the same mountainous territory; nay, of the\r\nvery same village!--What indeed more extraordinary, unless it be the\r\nspectacle of a Scotchman turned Turk for the sake of honours, held\r\non the tenure of a caprice from which even Scotch prudence can be no\r\nguarantee!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Garrick._--Mr. Twiss, a romancing traveller, was talking of a\r\nchurch he had seen in Spain which was a mile and a half long. \"Bless\r\nme, (cried Garrick,) how broad was it?\" \"About ten yards,\" said\r\nTwiss. \"This is, you'll observe, gentlemen, (said Garrick to the\r\ncompany,) not a round lie, but differs from his other stories, which\r\nare generally as broad as they are long.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Franklin Donation Fund._--The trustees of the fund established by\r\nDr. Franklin, for the benefit of young married mechanics, in Boston,\r\ngive notice, that they will make loans, in sums not exceeding 200\r\ndollars to one individual, on the terms prescribed by Dr. Franklin,\r\nviz.\r\n\r\n\"The applicant must be a married mechanic, under the age of 25\r\nyears, who has faithfully served an apprenticeship of five years\r\nat least, in the town of Boston. He must produce a certificate of\r\nhis moral character, from at least two respectable citizens of said\r\ntown, who are willing to become bound with him, to the trustees, for\r\nthe repayment of the sum loaned, by annual instalments of 10 per\r\ncent. with interest annually, at the rate of 5 per cent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flour._--Flour has recently been sold at Cincinnati for $2.25 per\r\nbbl. \"good money.\" The crops of grain have been exceedingly heavy in\r\nthe western country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Herculaneum Manuscripts._--Sir Humphrey Davy has had great success\r\nin unrolling the manuscripts of Herculaneum and Pompeii. In a short\r\ntime the contents of each roll will be known, as well as its title,\r\nwhich is generally found in the interiour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whaling!_--It would seem by the following articles from the Boston\r\nPatriot, that the invention of the torpedo by the late Robert\r\nFulton, to destroy enemies' ships in the late war, is about to be\r\nmade use of for another valuable purpose, viz. blowing up whales!\r\n\r\n\"It was hardly to have been expected, that these destructive engines\r\nshould have been adopted in the prosecution of one of the most\r\nthriving branches of business in which navigation is now employed.\r\nYet, we are informed that a vessel has recently been fitted at New\r\nBedford, bound on a whaling cruise, with an apparatus on board for\r\nthe purpose of taking whales by _blowing them up_.\r\n\r\n\"Torpedoes, of arrow form, are thrown from a gun on board the\r\nvessel, which are calculated to sink into the body of the whale, and\r\nthere explode. As the experiment has not yet been fully tested, we\r\nthink its success, to say, the least, is problematical.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York school fund, &c._--We have a long and interesting\r\nstatement in the New York papers, of the funds set apart for\r\nliterary purposes. They chiefly consist of bonds and mortgages, for\r\nmoney loaned, a considerable quantity of bank stocks, and sundry\r\nvaluable tracts of land. The amounts are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe fund for the support of \"common schools\" is equal to $1,232,908,\r\nand its annual product about $78,964.\r\n\r\nThe fund for the \"promotion of literature\" amounts to $201,439,\r\nand its income is $5,288. This fund is divided among the colleges,\r\nin proportion to their scholars. Both of these funds are on the\r\nincrease as to value and product.\r\n\r\nBesides,--the occasional grants of the legislature for literary\r\npurposes since 1790, amounts to $1,189,056. And the general\r\naggregate of appropriations, for the last thirty years, including\r\nescheated lands, schools lots, fees, &c., but excluding the annual\r\nrevenue derived from the permanent funds, is estimated to amount to\r\n3,000,000 of dollars!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Premiums._--At a meeting of the Merino Society in London, 12th\r\nMay, after awarding the prizes to the best show of sheep and\r\nsuperfine broadcloth, the premium of ten guineas for worsted yarn,\r\nwas adjudged to Mr. J. Head, of Kirkstall, near Leeds, for one\r\npound of wool spun by a newly invented machine, which was superior\r\nin fineness to any heretofore seen, and peculiarly adapted for the\r\nfinest bombazeens, &c. It produced 95 hanks of 530 yards each in\r\nlength, equal to 30 miles and 400 yards, to a pound of wool.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt mines of Meurthe._--The researches for the discovery of rock\r\nsalt, which commenced in July last, at Moyenire, in the department\r\nof La Meurthe, in France, are carried on to advantage. After\r\nexploring to the depth of 200 feet, and reaching the first layer,\r\nwhich is 11 feet in thickness, the workmen had to perforate a bed\r\nof gypsum and clay of five hundred and forty-six feet, when they\r\ncame to a second stratum of salt, eight feet in thickness. It is\r\nintended to remove the researches to two other neighbouring points,\r\nto ascertain the breadth and magnitude of the whole bed. The two\r\npoints form a triangle nearly equilateral, each side of which may\r\nbe about 6 or 700 toises in length. One of these points is the city\r\nof Vic, and the other to the south of it. On this latter point they\r\nhave already pierced to the depth of 26 feet of vegetable earth:\r\nthe orifice of each bore is 3½ inches, which constantly fills\r\nup with fresh water. The salt of the first bed is extremely white,\r\nand transparent as rock crystal. It is likewise very pure, and free\r\nfrom every noxious or terrene substance. The second appears to be\r\nintermixed with gypseous or argillaceous substance, but a very\r\nsmall proportion. This salt is brown, not unlike a clouded flint;\r\nboth the kinds are very compact, well crystallized, the fractures\r\ncubical, and the saline taste superior to that of any salt obtained\r\nby evaporation. It contains but very little of muriate of magnesia,\r\nor of sulphate of lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_More silver!_--We have the following account of the discovery of\r\na silver mine, in a paper printed at Salem, Indiana, July 10.--\"We\r\nhave been informed by gentlemen of credibility, that there has been\r\na silver mine lately discovered in the late purchase in this state.\r\nThe circumstances relating to it are these: A few months ago, a\r\ngentleman near the boundary line, was informed by an Indian, that\r\nthere was a mine of this kind somewhere, but refused to tell him\r\nwhere it was, unless the man would pay him fifty dollars, a horse,\r\na gun and several blankets, which the man did, and was taken to the\r\nplace, and brought away several pounds of the ore. He has since, we\r\nare told, brought away about 300 pounds. He refuses to tell where\r\nit is, but says there is at least three wagon loads already cast\r\ninto bars by the Indians, which he intends to bring away. We have\r\nseen (so have several citizens of Salem) some of the ore, and should\r\nsuppose it at least two-thirds silver. The ore is so pure that it\r\ncan be drawn out with the hammer into bars of almost any size, and\r\nit is thought by some to be sufficiently pure in its natural state.\r\nFrom the representation of it, the mine is inexhaustible, and in a\r\nsituation difficult to be discovered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIED,\r\n\r\n\r\nIn England, on the 19th June, at his house, Spring-grove, near\r\nHounslow, the venerable president of the Royal Society, the Right\r\nHon. Sir JOSEPH BANKS, G. C. B. &c. &c. &c. The loss to science by\r\nthe demise of this excellent man and liberal patron will be long and\r\nseverely felt. Sir Joseph had been for a long time labouring under a\r\nmost distressing illness; for some years he had been deprived of the\r\nuse of his lower extremities, and rendered so feeble as to be lifted\r\nfrom his room to his carriage. He possessed a princely fortune, of\r\nwhich he assigned a large portion to the encouragement of science,\r\nparticularly natural history, private and public charities, and\r\ndomestic hospitality.--Also, on the 31st May, I. BRADLEY, the\r\nYorkshire giant:--when dead he measured nine feet in length, and\r\nthree feet over the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nOf JOHN LOGAN, the author of the following touching stanzas, it is\r\nwell observed by his biographer CHALMERS, that it would be difficult\r\nto produce, from the whole range of English poetry, any thing more\r\nexquisitely tender and pathetic, than some of his productions.--He\r\ndied in London, December, 1788, in the fortieth year of his age.\r\nHis end is described as edifying. When he became too weak to hold a\r\nbook, we are told he employed his time in hearing such young persons\r\nas visited him read the Scriptures.\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRAES OF YARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Thy braes were bonny, Yarrow stream!\r\n      When first on them I met my lover,\r\n    Thy braes how dreary, Yarrow stream!\r\n      When now thy waves his body cover!\r\n    For ever now, O Yarrow stream!\r\n      Thou art to me a stream of sorrow;\r\n    For never on thy banks shall I\r\n      Behold my love, the flower of Yarrow.\r\n\r\n    \"He promised me a milk-white steed,\r\n      To bear me to his father's bowers;\r\n    He promised me a little page,\r\n      To 'squire me to his father's towers;\r\n    He promised me a wedding ring,--\r\n      The wedding day was fix'd to-morrow;--\r\n    Now he is wedded to his grave,\r\n      Alas, his watery grave, in Yarrow!\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet were his words when last we met;\r\n      My passion I as freely told him!\r\n    Clasp'd in his arms, I little thought\r\n      That I should never more behold him!\r\n    Scarce was he gone, I saw his ghost;\r\n      It vanish'd with a shriek of sorrow;\r\n    Thrice did the water-wraith ascend,\r\n      And gave a doleful groan thro' Yarrow!\r\n\r\n    \"His mother from the window look'd,\r\n      With all the longing of a mother;\r\n    His little sister weeping walk'd\r\n      The green-wood path to meet her brother:\r\n    They sought him east, they sought him west,\r\n      They sought him all the forest through;\r\n    They only saw the cloud of night,\r\n      They only heard the roar of Yarrow!\r\n\r\n    \"No longer from thy window look,\r\n      Thou hast no son, thou tender mother;\r\n    No longer walk thou lovely maid;\r\n      Alas, thou hast no more a brother!\r\n    No longer seek him east or west,\r\n      And search no more the forest through;\r\n    For wandering in the night so dark,\r\n      He fell a lifeless corse in Yarrow.\r\n\r\n    \"The tear shall never leave my cheek,\r\n      No other youth shall be my marrow;[9]\r\n    I'll seek thy body in the stream,\r\n      And then with thee I'll sleep in Yarrow.\"\r\n    The tear did never leave her cheek,\r\n      No other youth became her marrow;\r\n    She found his body in the stream,\r\n      And now with him she sleeps in Yarrow.\r\n\r\n  [9] Mate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IVY.\r\n\r\nFrom Barton's Poems.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dost thou not love, in the season of spring,\r\n      To twine thee a flowery wreath,\r\n    And to see the beautiful birch-tree fling\r\n      It shade on the grass beneath?\r\n    Its glossy leaf and its silvery stem;\r\n    Oh!
