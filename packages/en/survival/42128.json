There\r\nis a prevailing opinion, which ascribes to all living beings upon\r\nearth one common centre of origin, from which it is supposed they, in\r\nthe course of time, spread over wider and wider areas, till they\r\nfinally came into their present state of distribution; and what gives\r\nthis view a higher recommendation, in the opinion of most men, is the\r\ncircumstance, that such a method of distribution is considered as\r\nrevealed in our sacred writings. We hope, however, to be able to shew\r\nthat there is no such statement in the Book of Genesis; that this\r\ndoctrine of a unique centre of origin, and successive distribution of\r\nall animals is of very modern invention; and that it can be traced\r\nback for scarcely more than a century in the records of our science.\r\n\r\nThere is another view to which, more recently, naturalists have seemed\r\nto incline; viz., the assuming several centres of origin, from which\r\norganized beings were afterwards diffused over wider areas, in the\r\nsame manner as according to the first theory, the difference being\r\nonly in the assumption of several centres of dispersion instead of a\r\nsingle one.\r\n\r\nWe have recently been led to take a very different view of the\r\nsubject, and shall presently illustrate the facts upon which the view\r\nrests. But before we undertake to introduce more directly this\r\nsubject, there is another point which requires preliminary\r\ninvestigation, which seems to have been entirely lost sight of by all\r\nthose, without exception, who have studied the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals, and which seems to us to be the keystone of\r\nthe whole edifice, whenever we undertake to reconstruct the primitive\r\nplan of the geographical distribution of animals and plants. The\r\ndistribution of organized beings over the surface of our globe in its\r\npresent condition cannot be considered in itself; and without an\r\ninvestigation, at the same time, of the geographical distribution of\r\nthose organized beings which have existed in former geological\r\nperiods, and had become extinct before those of the present creation\r\nwere called into being. For it is well ascertained now that there is a\r\nnatural succession in the plan of creation--an intimate connection\r\nbetween all the types of the different periods of the creation from\r\nits beginning up to this day; so much so, that the present\r\ndistribution of animals and plants is the continuation of an order of\r\nthings which prevailed for a time at an earlier period, but which came\r\nto an end before the existing arrangement of things was introduced.\r\n\r\nThe animal kingdom, as we know it in our days, is therefore engrafted\r\nupon its condition in earlier periods; and it is to the distribution\r\nof animals in these earlier periods that we must look, if we would\r\ntrace the plan of the Creator from its commencement to its more\r\nadvanced development in our own time.\r\n\r\nIf there is any truth in the view that animals and plants originated\r\nfrom a common centre, it must be at the same time shewn that such an\r\nintimate connection between the animals existed at all periods; or, at\r\nleast, we should, before assuming such a view for the animals living\r\nin our days, discover a sufficient reason for ascribing to them\r\nanother mode of dispersion than to the animals and plants of former\r\nperiods. But there is such a wonderful harmony in all the great\r\nprocesses of nature, that, at the outset, we should be carefully on\r\nour guard against assuming different modes of distribution for the\r\norganized beings of former periods, and for those which at present\r\ncover the globe. Should it be plain that the animals and plants did\r\nnot originate from a common centre at the beginning of the creation,\r\nand during the different successive geological periods, we have at\r\nonce a strong indication that neither has such been the case with the\r\nanimals of the present day; and, on the other hand, if there were\r\nsatisfactory evidence that the animals and plants now living\r\noriginated from a common centre, we should consider the matter\r\ncarefully before trusting to the views derived from geological facts.\r\nLet us, therefore, examine first the value of the evidence on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nWe have already expressed, and we repeat here, our earnest belief that\r\nthe view of a unique centre of origin and distribution rests chiefly\r\nupon the supposed authority of the Mosaic record; and is in no way\r\nsustained by evidence derived from investigations in natural history.\r\nOn the contrary, wherever we trace the animals in their present\r\ndistributions, we find them scattered over the surface of our globe in\r\nsuch a manner, according to such laws, and under such special\r\nadaptations, that it would baffle the most fanciful imagination to\r\nconceive such an arrangement as the mere results of migrations, or of\r\nthe influence of physical causes over the dispersion of both animals\r\nand plants. For we find that all animals and plants of the arctic\r\nzones agree in certain respects and are uniform over the three\r\ncontinents which verge towards the northern pole, whilst those of the\r\ntemperate zone agree also in certain respects, but differ somewhat\r\nfrom each other within definite limits, in the respective continents.\r\nAnd the differences grow more and more prominent as we approach the\r\ntropical zone, which has its peculiar Fauna and Flora in each\r\ncontinent; so much so, that it is impossible for us to conceive such a\r\nnormal arrangement, unless it be the result of a premeditated plan,\r\ncarried out voluntarily according to predetermined laws.\r\n\r\nThe opinion which is considered as the Biblical view of the case, and\r\naccording to which all animals have originated in a common centre,\r\nwould leave us at a loss for any cause by which to account for the\r\nspecial dispersion of animals and plants beyond the mere necessity of\r\nremoving from the crowded ground to assume wider limits, as their\r\nincreased number made it constantly more and more necessary and\r\nimperative. According to this view, the animals of the arctic zone as\r\nwell as those of the tropics,--those of America as well as those of\r\nNew Holland,--have been first created upon the high lands of Iran, and\r\nhave taken their course in all directions, to settle where they are\r\nnow found to be strictly limited. It does not appear how such\r\nmigrations of polar animals could have taken place over the warmer\r\ntracts of land which they had to cross, and in which they cannot even\r\nbe kept alive, in our days, with the utmost precautions: nor how the\r\nterrestrial animals of New Holland, which have no analogies in the\r\nmain continents, could have reached that large island, nor why they\r\nshould have all moved thither. And, indeed, it is impossible, with\r\nsuch a theory, to account, either for the special adaptation of types\r\nto particular districts of the earth's surface, or for the limited\r\ndistribution of so many species which are found only over narrow\r\ndistricts in their present arrangement. It is inconsistent with the\r\nstructure, habits, and natural instincts of most animals, even to\r\nsuppose that they could have migrated over any great distances. It is\r\nin complete contradiction with the laws of nature, and all we know of\r\nthe changes our globe has undergone, to imagine that the animals have\r\nactually adapted themselves to their various circumstances during\r\ntheir migration, as this would be ascribing to physical influences as\r\nmuch power as to the Creator himself.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, the regular distribution, requiring precise laws, as we\r\nfind it does, cannot be attributed either to the voluntary migration\r\nof animals, or to the influence of physical causes, when we see so\r\nplainly that this distribution is in accordance with the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals and plants in former geological periods. But\r\nabout this presently. We will only add, that we cannot discover in the\r\nMosaic account anything to sustain such a view, nor even hints leading\r\nto such a construction. What is said of animals and plants in the\r\nfirst chapter of Genesis, what is mentioned of the preservation of\r\nthese animals and plants at the time of the deluge, relates chiefly to\r\norganized beings placed about Adam and Eve, and those which their\r\nprogeny had domesticated, and which lived with them in closer\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the results of geological investigations respecting\r\nthe origin of earlier races of animals and plants. It is\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained at present, that there have been many\r\ndistinct successive periods, during each of which large numbers of\r\nanimals and plants have been introduced upon the surface of our globe,\r\nto live and multiply for a time, then to disappear and be replaced by\r\nother kinds. Of such distinct periods, such successive creations, we\r\nnow know at least about a dozen, and there are ample indications that\r\nthe inhabitants of our globe have been successively changed at more\r\nepochs than are yet fully ascertained. But whether the number of these\r\ndistinct successive creations be twelve or twenty, the fact stands in\r\nfull light and evidence, that animals and plants which lived during\r\nthe first period disappeared, either gradually or successively, to\r\nmake room for others, and this at often-repeated intervals; and that\r\nthe existence of animals and plants which live now is of but recent\r\norigin, is equally well ascertained.\r\n\r\nThere is another series of phenomena, not less satisfactorily\r\nestablished, which go to shew that the extent of dry land rising above\r\nthe surface of the ocean has neither been equally extensive at all\r\ntimes, nor has it had the same outline at all periods. On the\r\ncontrary, we know that, early in the history of our globe, there has\r\nbeen a period, when but few low groups of islands existed above the\r\nsurface of the ocean, which, through successive elevation and\r\ndepression, have gradually enlarged and modified the extent and form\r\nof the mainland.\r\n\r\nAgain, in examining the remains of organized beings preserved in the\r\ndifferent strata constituting the solid crust of our globe, we find\r\nthat at each period, animals and plants were distributed in the ocean\r\nand over the mainland in a particular manner, characteristic of every\r\ngreat epoch. A closer uniformity in their distribution is found in the\r\nearlier deposits, so much so that the oldest fossils discovered in the\r\nsouthern extremity of Africa, on the eastern and southern shores of\r\nNew Holland, and in Van Diemen's Land, in North America, or in various\r\nparts of Europe, are almost identical, or at least so nearly related,\r\nthat they resemble each other much more than the animals and plants\r\nwhich at present live in the same countries; shewing that uniformity\r\nin the aspect of the surface of the globe, as well as in the nature of\r\nanimals and plants, was at first the prevailing rule, and that,\r\nwhatever was the primitive region of these animals and plants, their\r\ntypes occupied much more extensive districts than any race of living\r\nbeings during later periods. Are we to infer from this fact, that, at\r\nthat period, these animals and plants originated from one common\r\ncentre, and were distributed equally all over the globe? By no means.\r\nThough slight, we find nevertheless such differences among them in\r\ndistant parts of the world as would rather sustain the view of an\r\nadaptation in the earliest creations to more uniform circumstances,\r\nthan that of one centre of origin for all animals and plants of those\r\ndays. During later periods, indeed, we find from geological evidence\r\nthat large islands had been formed, more extensive tracts of land\r\nelevated above the surface of the ocean, and the remains both of the\r\nanimals and plants derived from these different regions present\r\nalready marked differences when we compare them with each\r\nother,--varieties similar to those which exist between the respective\r\ncontinents at present, though perhaps less marked. Shall we here again\r\nassume that animals and plants originated from another centre, or from\r\nthe same centre as those of former periods, to migrate over those\r\ndifferent parts of the world, through the sea as well as over land? It\r\nis impossible to arrive at such a conclusion, when we consider the\r\ndistribution of fossil remains in the more recent geological deposits,\r\nor in those strata which were formed during the latest geological\r\nperiods, immediately before the present creation. For we find in these\r\ncomparatively modern beds a distribution of fossil remains which\r\nagrees in a most remarkable manner with the present geographical\r\narrangement of animals and plants. For instance, the fossils of modern\r\ngeological periods in New Holland are of the same types as most of the\r\nanimals now living there. Again, the recent fossils of Brazil belong\r\nto the same families as those prevailing at present in Brazil; though,\r\nin both cases, fossil species are distinct from living ones. If,\r\ntherefore, the organized beings of the recent geological periods had\r\narisen from one central point of distribution, to be dispersed and\r\nfinally to become confined to those countries where their remains are\r\nfound in a fossil condition, and if the animals now living had also\r\nspread from a common origin over the same districts, and had then been\r\ncircumscribed within equally distinct limits, we should be led to the\r\nunnatural supposition, that animals of two distinct creations,\r\ndiffering specifically throughout, had taken the same lines of\r\nmigration, had assumed finally the same distribution, and had become\r\npermanent in the same regions, without any other inducement for their\r\nremoval and final settlement than the mere necessity of covering more\r\nextensive ground after they had become too numerous to remain any\r\nlonger together in one and the same district. This were to ascribe to\r\nthe animals themselves, or to the physical agents under which they\r\nlive, and by which they may be influenced, as much wisdom, as much\r\nprovidential forethought, as is evinced throughout nature, both in the\r\ndistribution of animals, and in their special adaptation to particular\r\nportions of the globe in which they are closely circumscribed at\r\npresent, and to which they were limited under similar circumstances\r\nduring those periods which preceded immediately the present\r\narrangement of things. Now these facts in themselves leave not the\r\nshadow of a doubt in our mind, that animals were primitively created\r\nall over the world, within those districts which they were naturally\r\nto inhabit for a certain time. The next question is--were these\r\norganized beings created in pairs, as is generally thought and\r\nbelieved? The opinion, that all animals must be referred to one\r\nsingle, primitive pair, is derived from evidence worthy of\r\nconsideration, no doubt, but the value of which may fairly be\r\nquestioned by naturalists; since this point, at least if we except\r\nAdam and Eve, is entirely of human construction, and only assumed\r\nbecause it is thought to shew a wise economy of means in the\r\nestablished order of things which exists. It is supposed, that, if one\r\npair were sufficient, there is no reason why the Creator should have\r\nintroduced at one time a greater number of each kind, as economy of\r\nmeans is always considered an indication of high wisdom. But are not\r\nthese human considerations? And if they are, and if we are entitled to\r\nquestion their value, let us see how they answer the object which was\r\nintended, namely, the peopling of the whole world with various races\r\nof organized beings.\r\n\r\nWhenever we consider the economy of nature, we observe great varieties\r\nin the habits of different animals. There are, indeed, some which live\r\nconstantly in pairs, and which by nature are designed to perpetuate\r\ntheir races in that way, and to spread generation after generation\r\nover their natural boundaries, thus mated. But there are others to\r\nwhich it is equally natural to live in herds or shoals, and which we\r\nnever find isolated. The idea of a pair of herrings, or of a pair of\r\nbuffaloes, is as contrary to the nature and habits of those\r\nanimals, as it is contrary to the nature of pines and birches to\r\ngrow singly, and to form forests in their isolation.\r\n\r\nBut we can go further. There are animals in which the number of\r\nindividuals of different sexes is naturally unequal, and among which\r\nthere are either constantly more males or constantly more females\r\nborn, as the result of their peculiar nature and habits in the\r\ncreation. A bee-hive never consists of a pair of bees; and never could\r\nsuch a pair preserve the species, with their habits. For them it is\r\nnatural to have one female and many males devoted to it, and thousands\r\nof neutral bees working for them. And this is the natural original\r\nmode of existence among that species of animals, which it would be\r\nutterly contrary to the laws of nature to consider as derived from a\r\nsingle pair. There are a number of birds, on the contrary, in which\r\nonly a few males are universally found with many females, living\r\ntogether in companies, such as the pheasants, and our domesticated\r\nfowls. It were easy to multiply examples in order to shew that a\r\ncreation of all animals in pairs would have been contrary to their\r\nvery nature, as we observe it in all. To assume that they have changed\r\nthis nature would be to fall back upon the necessity of ascribing to\r\nphysical influences a power which they do not possess,--that of\r\nproducing changes in the very nature of organized beings, and of\r\nmodifying the primitive plan of the Creator.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are animals which, by nature, are impelled to feed upon\r\nother animals. Was the primitive pair of lions to abstain from food\r\nuntil the gazelles and other antelopes had sufficiently multiplied to\r\npreserve their races from the persecution of these ferocious beasts?\r\nWere all animals, and the innumerable tribes of ferocious fishes which\r\nlive upon smaller ones, to abstain from food till these had been\r\nmultiplied to a sufficient extent to secure their preservation? Or\r\nwere, perhaps, the carnivorous animals created only at a later period?\r\nBut we find them everywhere together. They constitute natural,\r\nharmonious groups with the herbivorous tribes, both in the waters and\r\non land, preserving among each other such proportions as will maintain\r\nfor ages an undisturbed harmony in the creation.\r\n\r\nAgain, we find animals and plants occurring in distinct districts,\r\nunconnected with each other, in such ways that it would seem almost\r\nimpossible for either to migrate from any point of their natural\r\ncircle of distribution over its whole surface. Have, for instance,\r\nsuch animals as are found identical both in America and Europe been\r\ncreated either in Europe or in America, and wandered from one of the\r\ncontinents over to the other? Have those species which occur only in\r\nthe far north, and upon the higher summits of the Alps, been created\r\neither in the Alps or in the north, and wandered from one place to the\r\nother? We are at a loss for substantial arguments for believing that\r\neither one or the other place has been the primitive location of such\r\nanimals, or for denying their simultaneous creation in both.\r\n\r\nEvidence could be accumulated to shew, we will not say the\r\nimprobability only, but even the impossibility, of supposing that\r\nanimals and plants were created in single pairs, and assumed\r\nafterwards their present distribution. But the facts mentioned will be\r\nsufficient to introduce our argument, and from all we know of the laws\r\nof nature and of the distribution of animals, we conclude that they\r\ncould neither originate from a single pair, nor upon a single spot.\r\nAnd as for plants, we would ask naturalists whether it were not\r\nsuperfluous to create more than a single stalk of most plants, as\r\nvegetables, with a few exceptions, may multiply extensively from a\r\nsingle stem. But if it is granted that animals could not originate\r\nfrom a single pair, nor upon a single spot, what is the more natural\r\nview to take of the subject?\r\n\r\nWithout entering fully into this question, we may as well state that\r\nwe have been gradually led to the conclusion, that most animals and\r\nplants must have originated primitively over the whole extent of their\r\nnatural distribution. We mean to say that, for instance, lions, which\r\noccur over almost the whole of Africa, over extensive parts of\r\nSouthern Asia, and were formerly found even over Asia-Minor and\r\nGreece, must have originated primitively over the whole range of these\r\nlimits of their distribution. We are led to these conclusions by the\r\nvery fact, that the lions of the East Indies differ somewhat from\r\nthose of Northern Africa; these, again, differ from those of Senegal.\r\nIt seems more natural to suppose that they were thus distributed over\r\nsuch wide districts, and endowed with particular characteristics in\r\neach, than to assume that they constituted as many species; or to\r\nbelieve that, created anywhere in this circle of distribution, they\r\nhave gradually been modified to their present differences in\r\nconsequence of their migration. We admit these differences to be\r\nprimitive and contemporaneous, from the fact, that there are other\r\nanimals of different genera extending over the same tracts of land\r\nwhich have different representatives in each, circumscribed within\r\nnarrower bounds, and this particular combination in each special\r\ndistrict of the wider circle covered by the lion, seems, in our\r\nopinion, the strongest argument in favour of the view, that the\r\nparticular districts of distribution have been primitively ascribed,\r\nwith definite limits, to each species. Why should the antelopes north\r\nof the Cape of Good Hope differ from those of Arabia, or those of the\r\nSenegal, or those of the Atlas, or those of the East Indies, if they\r\nwere not primitively adapted with their special modifications to those\r\ndistricts, when we see the lion cover the whole range? And why should\r\nthe varieties we notice among the lions within these boundaries not be\r\nprimitive, though not constituting distinct species, when we see the\r\nherbivorous species of the same genus differ from one district to\r\nanother? And why should the differences in that one species of lion be\r\nthe result of changes in its primitive character, arising from its\r\ndistribution into new districts, when we see that the antelopes are at\r\nonce fixed as distinct species over the same ground?\r\n\r\nThis argument cannot be fully appreciated by those who are not\r\nextensively acquainted with natural history, but we may, perhaps, make\r\nit plainer by alluding to some other similar facts. Our fresh waters\r\nteem everywhere with animals and plants. Fishes and mollusca are among\r\nthe most prominent of their animals. Let us compare for a moment the\r\ndifferent species which occur in the Danube, in the Rhine, and in the\r\nRhone, three hydrographic basins entirely unconnected with each other\r\nthroughout their whole extent. They spring from the same mountain\r\nchain, as we may take the Inn as the source of the Danube. These three\r\ngreat rivers rise within a few miles of each other. Nevertheless, most\r\nof their fishes differ, but there are some which are common to the\r\nthree. We find the pickerel,--the European pickerel, in the three\r\nbasins. The eel is also common to them all. One kind of trout occurs\r\nin the three. But how strange the distribution of some others!--for\r\ninstance, the perches. In the Rhine we find _Perca fluviatilis_, and\r\n_Acerina cernua_; in the Rhone, _Perca fluviatilis_, and _Aspro\r\nvulgaris_; in the Danube, _Perca vulgaris_, _Lucio-perca Sandra_,\r\n_Acerina cernua_, _A. Schraitzer_, _Aspro vulgaris_, and _A. Zingel_.\r\nIf these animals had not originated in these rivers separately, why\r\nshould not such closely-allied species, some of which occur in the\r\nthree basins, have all spread equally into them? and if they\r\noriginated in the separate basins, we have within close limits a\r\nmultiple origin of the same species.\r\n\r\nAnd that this multiple origin must be admitted as a fact is shewn by\r\nthe following further evidence. Among the carpes we find, for\r\ninstance, _Barbus_, _Gobio_, _Carpio_, common to the three. But the\r\nDanube has three _Gobios_, whilst the others have but one, one of the\r\nDanube being identical with the one of the other two rivers. The most\r\nstriking fact, however, occurs in the genus _Leuciscus_. _Leuciscus\r\ndobula_ is common to the three; but in addition to it, the Danube has\r\nseveral species which occur neither in the Rhine nor in the Rhone. The\r\nbasin of the Rhone, again, has several species which occur neither in\r\nthe Danube nor in the Rhine; and in the Rhine, there are species which\r\nbelong neither to the Rhone nor to the Danube. Now, we ask, could all\r\nthese species of _Leuciscus_ have been created in one of the\r\nbasins,--in the Danube for instance,--and have migrated in such a way,\r\nthat a certain number of the species should remain solely in the\r\nDanube, while some others left the Danube altogether to settle finally\r\nonly in the Rhone, and others to settle only in the Rhine; that one\r\naccompanying those species peculiar to the Rhone, remained in the\r\nDanube with those species peculiar to it, and settled also in the\r\nRhone, with those species peculiar to that river, and also in the\r\nRhine with the species peculiar to the Rhine? And whether we assume\r\nthe Rhone as the primitive centre, instead of the Danube or the Rhine,\r\nthe argument holds equally good. We have one species common to the\r\nthree rivers, and several species peculiar to each, which could never\r\nhave migrated (if migration took place) in such a manner as to assume\r\ntheir present combinations. But if, on the contrary, we suppose that\r\nall the species originated in the rivers where they occur, then we\r\nhave again a multiple origin of that species which is common to the\r\nthree, for it were wonderful if that one alone had migrated, when they\r\nare all so closely allied. Here, again, we arrive at the conclusion,\r\nthat the same species can have a multiple origin, in the same manner\r\nas, from the considerations alluded to before, we have decided that\r\nspecies do not originate from single pairs, but in their natural\r\nproportion with the other species with which they live simultaneously\r\nover the whole ground which they cover. And this is the view which we\r\ntake of the natural distribution of animals, that they originated\r\nprimitively over the whole extent of their natural distribution; that\r\nthey originated there, not in pairs, but in large numbers, in such\r\nproportions as suits their natural mode of living, and the\r\npreservation of species; and that the same species may have originated\r\nin different unconnected parts of the more extensive circle of their\r\ndistribution. We are well aware that there are very many species which\r\nare known to have spread beyond what we would call their natural\r\nlimits; species which did not occur in North America before the\r\nsettlement of the whites, that are now abundant here over very\r\nextensive tracts of country; other species which have been introduced\r\nfrom America into Europe, and also into other parts of the world, in\r\ndifferent ways. But these are exceptional facts; and, what is more\r\nimportant, these changes in the primitive distribution of organised\r\nbeings, both animals and plants, have taken place under the influence\r\nof man,--under the influence of a being acting not merely from natural\r\nimpulses, or under the pressure of physical causes, but moved by a\r\nhigher will. So that these apparent exceptions to the rule would only\r\ngo to confirm it; as, within the limits of these secondary changes, we\r\nsee a will acting, just as we consider that the primitive distribution\r\nof all organized beings has been the result of the decrees of the\r\nCreator, and not the result of mere natural influences.\r\n\r\nHaving thus led the way to what we would consider as a fairer ground\r\nfor investigating the natural geographical distribution of animals and\r\nplants, let us now examine the natural lines which seem to regulate\r\nthis distribution. Nothing can be more striking to the observer than\r\nthe fact, that animals, though endowed with the power of locomotion,\r\nremain within fixed bounds in their geographical distribution,\r\nalthough an unbounded field for migration is open to them in all\r\ndirections, over land, through the air, and through the waters. And no\r\nstronger argument can be introduced to shew that living beings are\r\nendowed with their power of locomotion to keep within general\r\nboundaries, rather than to spread extensively. There is another fact\r\nwhich shews that animals are made to remain within these natural\r\nlimits. We would allude especially to the difficulty we experience\r\nwhenever we attempt to transport animals from their native country\r\ninto other countries, even if we secure for them as nearly as can be\r\nthe same conditions in which they used to live. Again, observe the\r\nchanges which animals undergo when they are once acclimatized to\r\ncountries different from their native land. There can be no more\r\nstriking evidence of this than the endless variety of our domestic\r\nanimals, and there is no subject which more requires a renewed and\r\ncareful investigation than this. We do not, however, feel competent to\r\nintroduce this point more fully to the notice of our readers. Some\r\nfacts bearing upon the question may best be mentioned in a reference\r\nto the different animals which man has thus made subservient to his\r\nsocial condition. We shall here allude only to the laws of\r\ndistribution of wild animals in their natural condition.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated, that the present distribution of animals\r\nagrees with the distribution of extinct types belonging to earlier\r\ngeological periods, so that the laws which regulate the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals seem to have been the same at all times,\r\nthough modified in accordance with the successive changes which the\r\nanimal kingdom has undergone from the earliest period of its creation\r\nto the present day. The universal law is, that all animals are\r\ncircumscribed within definite limits. There is not one species which\r\nis uniformly spread all over the globe, either among the aquatic races\r\nor among the terrestrial ones. Of the special distribution of man, who\r\nalone is found everywhere, we shall speak hereafter. The special\r\nadaptation of animals to certain districts is not merely limited to\r\nthe individual species. We observe a similar adaptation among genera,\r\nentire families, and even whole classes. For instance, all _Polypi_,\r\n_Medusæ_, and _Echinoderms_, that is to say all _Radiata_, without\r\nexception, are aquatic.[1] That large group of animals has not a\r\nsingle terrestrial representative upon any point of the surface of the\r\nglobe; and during all periods of the history of our earth, we find\r\nthat they have always been limited to the liquid element. And they are\r\nnot only aquatic, they are chiefly marine, as but exceedingly few of\r\nthem are found in fresh waters. Among _Mollusca_ we find almost the\r\nsame adaptation. Their element also is the sea. The number of\r\nfresh-water species is small, compared with that of marine types; and\r\nwe find terrestrial species in only one of their classes. In former\r\nperiods, also, _Mollusca_ were chiefly marine; fluviatile and\r\nterrestrial types occurring only in more recent periods.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 1: The following statements have been strictly\r\n     considered, and are made in reference to a revised classification\r\n     of the animal kingdom, the details of which must, however, be\r\n     omitted here, as they would extend this article beyond our\r\n     allotted bounds.\r\n\r\nWith the _Articulata_, we find another state of things. Two of their\r\nclasses, the worms and _Crustacea_, are chiefly marine, or at least\r\naquatic, as we have a number of fresh-water worms, and some\r\nfresh-water _Crustacea_. But insects are, for the most part, chiefly\r\nterrestrial, feeding upon terrestrial plants, at least in their\r\nfull-grown condition; though a large number of these animals are\r\nfluviatile, and even some marine, during their earlier periods of\r\nlife. In the _Vertebrata_, the adaptations are more diversified. Only\r\none class of these animals is entirely aquatic--the fishes; and the\r\nnumber of the marine species is far greater than that of the\r\nfresh-water kinds. Among reptiles there are many which are aquatic,\r\neither throughout life, or through the earlier period of their\r\nexistence. But, as if animal life rose to higher organization, as it\r\nleaves the ocean to inhabit dry land or fresh waters, we find that the\r\ngreater number of the aquatic reptiles are fluviatile, and but a few\r\nmarine. This fact agrees wonderfully with the natural gradation of the\r\nclasses already mentioned. The lower type of animals, the _Radiata_,\r\nis almost exclusively marine. Among _Mollusca_, we have a greater\r\nnumber of marine types, a large number of fluviatile species, and\r\nfewer terrestrial, and these are the highest in their class. Again,\r\namong _Articulata_, the lower classes, worms and _Crustacea_, are\r\nmarine, or at least fluviatile, whilst the highest class, that of\r\ninsects, is chiefly terrestrial or fluviatile, during the earlier\r\nperiods of their growth. Among the _Vertebrata_ we see the lowest\r\nform, that of fishes, entirely aquatic, and the same rule applies\r\npartially to the reptiles; but as the class rises, the number of the\r\nfluviatile species is greater than that of the marine types. Next,\r\namong birds, which by their structure are exclusively adapted to live\r\nin the atmospheric air, we find the larger number to be terrestrial,\r\nand only the lower ones to live upon water, or dive occasionally into\r\nit, always seeking the surface, however, to breathe and to perform\r\ntheir most important vital functions. It is, nevertheless, not a\r\nlittle strange, that this class should by nature be adapted to rise\r\ninto the air, just as if the first tendency towards liberating them\r\nfrom the aquatic element had been carried to an excess, and gave them\r\na relation to the earth which no other class, as a whole, holds to\r\nthat degree, except, perhaps, the insects, which are placed among the\r\n_Articulata_ in the same relation to the lower classes and the natural\r\nelement, which the class of birds maintains among _Vertebrata_. The\r\nhighest class of _Vertebrata_ affords us examples of these three modes\r\nof adaptation, the lowest of these being entirely aquatic, and even\r\nabsolutely marine; next, we have fluviatile types of the large\r\nterrestrial mammalia, in the family of _Manatees_, again, a swimming\r\nfamily among Carnivora, another flying, most of them however walking\r\nupon their four extremities on solid ground, but at the head of all,\r\nman, standing upright, to look freely upwards, and to contemplate the\r\nwhole universe.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful adaptation of the whole range of animals, as it exists\r\nat present, shews the most intimate connection with the order of\r\nsuccession of animals in former geological periods. The four great\r\ntypes, _Radiata_, _Mollusca_, _Articulata_, and _Vertebrata_, were\r\nintroduced at the beginning simultaneously. However, the earliest\r\nrepresentatives of these great types were all aquatic. We find in the\r\nlowest beds which contain fossils, _Polypi_, together with\r\nstar-fishes, bivalve shells, univalves, chambered shells, cases of\r\nworms, and _Crustacea_, being representatives of at least seven out of\r\nnine classes of invertebrate animals, if we are not allowed to suppose\r\nthat _Medusæ_ existed also, and if insects were still wanting for a\r\ntime. But, in addition to these, fishes among _Vertebrata_ are\r\nintroduced, but fishes only, all of which are exclusively marine. At a\r\nsomewhat later period insects come in. We find next reptiles in\r\naddition to fishes--the lower classes, or invertebrates, continuing to\r\nbe represented through all subsequent epochs, but by species changing\r\ngradually at each period, as all classes do after they have been once\r\nintroduced. The first representatives among reptiles are marine, next\r\nhuge terrestrial ones, some, perhaps, flying types, and with them, and\r\nperhaps even before them, birds, allied to the wading tribes: still\r\nlater, _Mammalia_, beginning again with marine and huge terrestrial\r\ntypes, followed by the higher quadrupeds; and, last only, Man,--at the\r\nhead of the creation, in time as well as in eminence, by structure,\r\nintelligence, and moral endowments.\r\n\r\nBesides the general adaptation of animals to the surrounding media,\r\nthere is a more special adaptation, which seems not less important,\r\nthough it is perhaps less striking. Animals, as well as plants, do not\r\nlive equally at all depths of the ocean, or at all heights above its\r\nsurface. There must be a deep influence upon the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals in a vertical direction derived from\r\natmospheric pressure above the surface of the waters, and from the\r\npressure of the water itself at greater and greater depths,--the level\r\nof the ocean, or a small elevation above its surface, or a shallow\r\ndepth under its surface, being the field of the most extensive and\r\nintensive development of animal life. And it is not a little\r\nremarkable that in the same classes we should find lower types at\r\ngreater depths in the ocean, and also lower types at greater heights\r\nabove. We will quote a few examples, to shew how much we may expect\r\nfrom investigations pursued in this direction, for at present we have\r\nbut little information which can aid us in ascertaining the\r\nrelationship between atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure and the\r\nenergies of animal life.\r\n\r\nAmong _Polypi_, the higher forms, such as _Actiniæ_, are more abundant\r\nin shallow water than the lower coral-forming types. Among _Medusæ_,\r\nthe young are either attached to the bottom, or grow from the depth,\r\nwhile the perfect free forms of these animals come to the surface.\r\nAmong _Echinoderms_, the _Crinoids_ are deep-water forms; free\r\nstar-fishes and _Echini_, and, above all _Holothuriæ_, living nearer\r\nthe surface. Among _Mollusca_, the _Acephala_, which are lowest, have\r\ntheir lower types,--the _Brachiopods_, entirely confined to deep\r\nwaters; the _Monomyarians_ appear next, and, above them, the\r\n_Dimyarians_; among these latter, the highest family, the _Nayades_,\r\nrises above the level of the ocean into the fresh waters, and extends\r\neven to considerable heights above the sea, in lakes and rivers. A\r\nnumber of examples of all classes should be mentioned, to shew that\r\nthis is the universal case; as, for instance, among _Crustacea_ the\r\n_Macrura_ are, in general species of deeper water than the true crabs,\r\nof which some come even upon dry land. Again, on the slopes of our\r\nmountains, the highest forms among _Mammalia_ which remain numerous\r\nare the _Ruminants_ and _Rodents_. There are no _Carnivora_ living in\r\nhigh regions. Among birds of prey, we have the vultures, rising above\r\nthe highest summits of mountains, while eagles and falcons hover over\r\nthe woods and plains, by the water sides, and along the sea-shores.\r\nAmong reptiles, salamanders, frogs, and toads occur higher than any\r\nturtles, lizards, &c. But the same adaptation may be traced with\r\nreference to the latitudes under which animals are found. Those of the\r\nhigher latitudes, the arctic and antarctic species, resemble both the\r\nanimals of high, prominent mountain chains, and those of the deep\r\nsea-waters, which there meet in the most unexpected combinations (and\r\nit is surprising to see how extensively this is the case); while, in\r\nlower latitudes, towards the tropics, we find everywhere the higher\r\nrepresentatives of the same families. For instance, among _Mammalia_\r\nwe observe monkeys only in warm latitudes, and they die out in the\r\nwarmer parts of the temperate zone. The great development of\r\n_Digitigrades_--lions, tigers, &c., takes place within the tropics,\r\nsmaller species, like wolves and foxes, weasels, &c., occurring in the\r\nnorth, whilst the _Plantigrades_, which come nearer and nearer to the\r\nseal, follow an inverse progression, the largest and most powerful of\r\nthem being the arctic ice bear, which meets there his family\r\nrelations, the _Pinnipedia_, that are so numerous in the polar\r\nregions. Again, the families of _Ruminants_ and _Pachyderms_ seem to\r\nform an exception, for though belonging to the lower types of\r\n_Mammalia_, they prevail in the tropical zone; but let us remember\r\nthat they were among the earlier inhabitants of our globe, and the\r\nfact of their occurring more extensively in warm climates is rather a\r\nreminiscence of the plan of creation in older times, than an\r\nadaptation to the law regulating at present the distribution of\r\norganized beings. The gradation of animals among birds being less\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained, we do not venture to say anything\r\nrespecting their geographical distribution, in relation to climates.\r\nBut among reptiles, we cannot overlook the fact, that the crocodiles,\r\nwhich are the highest in structure, are altogether tropical, and\r\nthe _Batrachians_, which rank lowest, especially the salamandroid\r\nforms, are rather types of the colder temperate zone than of the warm,\r\n&c. From these facts it is plain, that the geographical distribution\r\nof all groups has a direct reference to atmospheric and hydrostatic\r\npressure on one side, and also to the intensity of light and heat over\r\nthe surface of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe special adaptation of minor groups begins very early in the\r\nhistory of our globe, and extends at present all over its surface. In\r\nthe same manner as animals are adapted to natural limits in their\r\nlarge primitive groups which we call classes, we find also the minor\r\ndivisions more closely adapted to particular circumstances of the\r\nphysical condition of all parts of the globe. Among _Mammalia_, the\r\ngreat type of _Marsupialia_ is placed in New Holland, and extends\r\nlittle beyond that continent into the adjacent islands. A very few\r\nrepresentatives of that family are found in America. Asia, Africa, the\r\ncolder parts of North America, and its southern extremity, are\r\nentirely deprived of this type. The family of _Edentata_, again, has\r\nits centre of development in South America, where the sloth, dasypus,\r\nant-eaters, &c., form characteristic types, of which a few analogues\r\noccur in Africa, along its southern extremity and western coast. Now\r\nit is a fact upon which we cannot insist too strongly, that the same\r\ndistricts of New Holland and South America were, during an earlier\r\ngeological period comparatively recent, the seat of an equally wide\r\ndevelopment of the same animals in the same extensive proportion as at\r\npresent. We need only refer to the beautiful investigations of Dr\r\nLund, upon the fossil mammalia of Brazil, and to those, no less\r\nimportant, of Professor Owen, upon the fossil remains of mammalia of\r\nNew Holland, to leave not a shadow of doubt upon this adaptation,\r\nwhich indicates distinctly these two regions, at two distinct periods\r\nremote from each other, as the points of development of two distinct\r\nfamilies, which have never spread over other parts of the globe at any\r\nperiod since the time of their existence, indicating at least two\r\ndistinct foci of creation, with the same characters, at two successive\r\nepochs; a fact which, in our opinion, can never be reconciled to the\r\nidea of a unique centre of origin of the animals now living. But\r\nthough other families have never been and are not now localized in so\r\nspecial a manner, we nevertheless find them circumscribed within\r\ncertain limits, in particular districts, or, at least, in particular\r\nzones.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, the monkeys are entirely tropical. But here,\r\nagain, we notice a very intimate adaptation of their types to the\r\nparticular continents, as the monkeys of tropical America constitute a\r\nfamily altogether distinct from the monkeys of the Old World, there\r\nbeing not one species of any of the genera of _Quadrumana_, so\r\nnumerous on this continent, found either in Africa or in Asia. The\r\nmonkeys of the Old World, again, constitute a natural family by\r\nthemselves, extending equally over Africa and Asia; but the species of\r\nAfrica differ from those of Asia; and there is even a close\r\nrepresentative analogy between those of different parts of these two\r\ncontinents; the orangs of Africa, the chimpanzee and gorilla,\r\ncorresponding to the red orang of Sumatra and Borneo, and the smaller\r\nlong armed species of continental Asia. And what is not a little\r\nremarkable is the fact, that the black orang occurs upon that\r\ncontinent which is inhabited by the black human race, whilst the brown\r\norang inhabits those parts of Asia over which the chocolate-coloured\r\nMalays have been developed. There is again a peculiar family of\r\n_Quadrumana_ confined to the Island of Madagascar--the makis--which\r\nare entirely peculiar to that island, and the eastern coast of Africa\r\nopposite to it, and to one spot on the western shore of Africa. But in\r\nNew Holland, and the adjacent islands, there are no monkeys at all,\r\nthough the climatic conditions seem not to exclude their existence any\r\nmore than those of the large Asiatic islands, upon which such high\r\ntypes of this order are found. And these facts more than any other,\r\nwould indicate that the special adaptation of animals to particular\r\ndistricts of the surface of our globe is neither accidental, nor\r\ndependent upon physical conditions, but is implied in the primitive\r\nplan of the creation itself. Whatever classes we may take into\r\nconsideration, we shall find similar adaptations, and though, perhaps,\r\nthe greater uniformity of some families renders the difference of the\r\ntypes in various parts of the world less striking, they are none the\r\nless real. The _Carnivora_ of tropical Asia are not the same as those\r\nof tropical Africa, or those of tropical America. Their birds and\r\nreptiles present similar differences. The want of an ostrich in Asia,\r\nwhen we have one, the largest of the family, in Africa, and two\r\ndistinct species in Southern America, and two cassowaries, one in New\r\nHolland, and another in the Sunda Islands, shews this constant process\r\nof analogous or representative species repeated over different parts\r\nof the world to be the principle regulating the distribution of\r\nanimals, and the fact that these analogous species are different,\r\nagain, cannot be reconciled to the idea of a common origin, as each\r\ntype is peculiar to the country where it is now found. These\r\ndifferences are more striking in tropical regions than anywhere else.\r\nThe rhinoceros of the Sunda Islands differs from those of Africa, and\r\nthere is none in America. The elephant of Asia differs from that of\r\nAfrica, and there is none in America. One tapir is found in the Sunda\r\nIslands, there is none in Africa, but we find one in South America,\r\n&c. Everywhere special adaptation, particular forms in each continent,\r\nan omission of some allied type here, when in the next group it occurs\r\nall over the zone.\r\n\r\nAs we ascend into the temperate zone, we find, however, the similarity\r\ngreatly increased. The difference between the species of the same\r\nfamily in temperate Asia, temperate Europe, and temperate America is\r\nmuch less than between the corresponding animals of the tropical zone,\r\nand no doubt it is to this great assemblage of more uniform animals,\r\nliving originally within the main seat of human civilization, that we\r\nmust ascribe the idea of their common origin, which has so long\r\nprevailed and been so serious an obstacle to a real insight into these\r\nnatural phenomena. What, indeed, could be more natural for man, when\r\nfor the first time reflecting upon nature around him,--when seeing, as\r\nfar as he could extend his investigations, all things alike,--than to\r\nimagine that every thing arose from a common centre, and spread with\r\nhim over the world, as it has been the fate of the white race, and of\r\nthat only, to extend all over the globe, and that, influenced by the\r\nphenomena of the zone in which he lived and wandered, and from which\r\nhe extended farther, he took it for granted that all animals followed\r\nthe same laws. But now that we know the whole surface of our globe so\r\nsatisfactorily, there can no longer be a question about the difference\r\nbetween animals and plants in the lower latitudes in all continents.\r\nBesides, we see them equally striking in the southernmost extremities\r\nof the three great continents, so that there can no longer be any\r\ndoubt about the primitive adaptation of these various types to the\r\ncontinents where they live, as we do not find a single one naturally\r\ndiffused everywhere over all continents. Notwithstanding, therefore,\r\nthe slighter differences we notice between the animals of different\r\ncontinents in the temperate zone, we are thus led step by step to\r\nascribe to them also a special origin upon those continents where they\r\nnow occur.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as we rise to the highest latitudes, the uniformity\r\nbecomes so close, that there is no longer any marked difference\r\nnoticed between the animals about the arctic regions, either in\r\nAmerica, Europe, or Asia; and we are naturally led to restrict the\r\nidea of a common centre of origin, or at least of a narrow circle of\r\nprimitive development, to those animals which spread equally over the\r\nicy fields extending around the northern pole upon the three\r\ncontinents which meet in the north. The phenomena of geographical\r\ndistribution which we observe there among the terrestrial animals are\r\nrepeated in the same manner among the aquatic ones. The fishes in the\r\narctic seas do not materially differ on the shores of Europe, Asia,\r\nand America, and through the northern Atlantic and through Behring's\r\nStraits they extend more or less towards the colder temperate zone, or\r\nmigrate into it at particular seasons of the year, as do most birds of\r\nthe arctic regions also. But in the temperate zone we begin to find\r\nmore and more marked differences between the inhabitants of different\r\ncontinents, and even between those of the opposite shores of the same\r\nocean; as, for instance, the fishes of Europe (some of the northern\r\nspecies excepted) are not identical with those of the temperate shores\r\nof North America, notwithstanding the very open field left for their\r\nuniform distribution across the Atlantic. Such is also the case\r\nbetween the fishes of Western Africa and those of Central America, and\r\nbetween those of the southern extremities of these continents. The\r\nfishes of the Indian Ocean, and the fishes of the Pacific vary\r\ngreatly, and, though some families have a wider range, there are many\r\nwhich are circumscribed within the narrowest limits. It is one of the\r\nmost striking phenomena in the geographical distribution of\r\naquatic animals, to find entire families of fishes completely\r\ncircumscribed within particular groups of islands, such, for instance,\r\nas the _Labyrinthici_, which are peculiar to the Sunda Islands, and\r\nthe family of _Goniodonts_, which are found only in the rivers of\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nA similar narrow limitation occurs also among the terrestrial animals,\r\nas the family of _Colubris_ is entirely circumscribed within the\r\nboundaries of the warmer parts of the American continent. The\r\nappearance during the warmer season of the year of a few species of\r\nthat family in the Northern States, does not make this case less\r\nstrong. Examples might be multiplied without end to shew everywhere\r\nspecial adaptation, narrow circumscription, or representative\r\nadaptation of species in different parts of the world; but those\r\nmentioned will be sufficient to sustain the argument that animals are\r\nnaturally antochthones wherever they are found, and have been so at\r\nall geological periods; that in northern regions they are most\r\nuniform; that their diversity goes on increasing through the temperate\r\nzone till it reaches its maximum in the tropics; that this diversity\r\nis again reduced in the aquatic animals towards the antarctic\r\npole, though the physical difference between the southernmost\r\nextremities of America, Africa, and New Holland, seems to have called\r\nfor an increased difference between their terrestrial animals.\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to distinguish special provinces in the natural\r\ndistribution of animals, and we may adopt the following division as\r\nthe most natural: _First_, the _arctic province_, with prevailing\r\nuniformity. _Second_, the temperate zone, with at least three distinct\r\nzoological provinces--the _European temperate zone_, west of the Ural\r\nMountains, the _Asiatic temperate zone_ east of the Ural Mountains,\r\nand the _American temperate zone_, which may be subdivided into two,\r\nthe _eastern_ and the _western_--for the animals east and west of the\r\nRocky Mountains differ sufficiently to constitute two distinct\r\nzoological provinces. Next, the tropical zone, containing the _African\r\nzoological province_, which extends over the main part of the African\r\ncontinent, including all the country south of the Atlas and north of\r\nthe Cape Colonies; the _tropical Asiatic province_, south of the great\r\nHimalayan chain, and including the Sunda Islands, whose _Fauna_ has\r\nquite a continental character, and differs entirely from that of the\r\nIslands of the Pacific, as well as from that of New Holland; the\r\n_American tropical province_, including Central America, the West\r\nIndies, and tropical South America. _New Holland_ constitutes in\r\nitself a special province, notwithstanding the great differences of\r\nits northern and southern climate, the animals of the whole continent\r\npreserving throughout their peculiar typical character. But it were a\r\nmistake to conceive that the _Faunæ_ or natural groups of animals are\r\nto be limited according to the boundaries of the mainland. On the\r\ncontrary we may trace their natural limits into the ocean, and refer\r\nto the temperate European _Fauna_ the eastern shores of the Atlantic,\r\nas we refer its western shores to the American temperate _Fauna_.\r\nAgain, the eastern shores of the Pacific belong to the western\r\nAmerican _Fauna_, as the western Pacific shores belong to the Asiatic\r\n_Fauna_. In the Atlantic Ocean there is no purely oceanic _Fauna_ to\r\nbe distinguished, but in the _Pacific_ we have such a _Fauna_,\r\nentirely marine in its main character, though interspread with\r\ninnumerable islands extending east of the Sunda Islands and New\r\nHolland to the western shores of tropical America. The islands west of\r\nthis continent seem, indeed, to have very slight relations in their\r\nzoological character with the western parts of the mainland. South of\r\nthe tropical zone we have the _South American temperate Fauna_, and\r\nthat of the _Cape of Good Hope_, as other distinct zoological\r\nprovinces. Van Diemen's Land, however, does not constitute a\r\nzoological province in itself, but belongs to the province of New\r\nHolland, by its zoological character. Finally, the antarctic circle\r\nencloses a special zoological province, including the _antarctic\r\nFauna_, which, in a great measure, corresponds to the arctic _Fauna_\r\nin its uniformity, though it differs from it in having chiefly a\r\nmaritime character, while the arctic _Fauna_ has an almost entirely\r\ncontinental aspect.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the principal races of man, in their natural\r\ndistribution, cover the same extent of ground as the great zoological\r\nprovinces, would go far to shew that the differences which we notice\r\nbetween them are also primitive; but for the present we shall abstain\r\nfrom further details upon a subject involving so difficult problems as\r\nthe question of the unity or plurality of origin of the human family,\r\nsatisfied as we are to have shewn that animals, at least, did not\r\noriginate from a common centre, nor from single pairs, but according\r\nto the laws which at present still regulate their existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Additional Illustrations of the Geographical Distribution of\r\n                             Animals._\r\n\r\n         I.--_Geographical Distribution of Sturgeons._[2]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 2: Agassiz's Lake Superior, p. 264.\r\n\r\nThe sturgeons are generally large fishes, which live at the bottom of\r\nthe water, feeding with their toothless mouths upon decomposed\r\norganized substances. Their movements are rather sluggish, resembling\r\nsomewhat those of the cod-fish.\r\n\r\nTheir geographical distribution is quite peculiar, and constitutes\r\none of their prominent peculiarities. Located as they are, in the\r\ncolder portions of the temperate zone, they inhabit either the fresh\r\nwaters or the seas exclusively, or alternately both these\r\nelements,--remaining during the larger part of the year in the sea,\r\nand ascending the rivers in the spawning season. Although adapted to\r\nthe cold regions of the temperate, they do not seem to extend into the\r\narctic zone, and I am not aware that they have been observed in any of\r\nthe waters of the warmer half of the temperate zone. The great basin\r\nof salt-water lakes or seas which extends east of the Mediterranean,\r\nseems to be their principal abode in the Old World, or at least the\r\nregion in which the greater number of species occur; and each species\r\ntakes a wide range, extending up the Danube and its tributaries, and\r\nall the Russian rivers emptying into the Black Sea. From the Caspian\r\nthey ascend the Wolga in immense shoals, and are found further east in\r\nthe lakes of Central Asia, even as far as the borders of China. The\r\ngreat Canadian lakes constitute another centre of distribution of\r\nthese fishes in the New World, but here they are not so numerous, nor\r\ndo they ever occur in contact with salt water in this basin.\r\n\r\nNorthwards, there is another great zone of distribution of sturgeons,\r\nwhich inhabit all the great northern rivers emptying into the Arctic\r\nSea, in Asia as well as in America. They occur equally in the\r\nintervening seas, being found on the shores of Norway and Sweden, in\r\nthe Baltic and North Seas, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean, from\r\nwhich they ascend the northern rivers of Germany, as well as those of\r\nHolland, France, and Great Britain. Even the Mediterranean and the\r\nAdriatic have their sturgeons, though few in number. There are also\r\nsome on the Atlantic shores of North America, along the British\r\npossessions as well as the northern and middle United States. They\r\nseem to be exceedingly numerous in the Northern Pacific, being found\r\neverywhere from Behring's Straits and Japan to the northern shores of\r\nChina, and on the north-west coast of America, as far south as the\r\nColumbia River. Again, the so-called western waters of the United\r\nStates have their own species, from the Ohio down to the lower portion\r\nof the Mississippi, but it does not appear that these species ascend\r\nthe rivers from the Gulf of Mexico. I suppose them to be rather\r\nentirely fluviatile, like those of the great Canadian lakes.\r\n\r\nBeyond the above limits southwards there are nowhere sturgeons to be\r\nfound, not even in the Nile, though emptying into a sea in which they\r\noccur; and as for the great rivers of Southern Asia and of tropical\r\nAfrica, not only the sturgeons, but another family is wanting\r\nthere,--I mean the family of _Goniodonts_, which in Central and\r\nSouthern America takes the place of the sturgeons of the north. Again,\r\nall the species in different parts of the world are different.\r\n\r\nIt is a most extraordinary fact, which will hereafter throw much light\r\nupon the laws of geographical distribution of animals and their mode\r\nof association, viz., that certain families are entirely circumscribed\r\nwithin comparatively narrow limits, and that their special location\r\nhas an unquestionable reference to the location of other animals; or,\r\nin other words, that natural families, apparently little related to\r\neach other, are confined to different parts of the world, but are\r\nlinked together by some intermediate form, which itself is located in\r\nthe intermediate track between the two extremes. In the case now\r\nbefore us, we have the sturgeons extending all around the world in the\r\nnorthern temperate hemisphere, in its seas as well as in its fresh\r\nwaters, all closely related to each other. Neither in Asia nor in\r\nAfrica is there an aberrant form of that type, or any representative\r\ntype in the warmer zones; but in North America we have the genus\r\n_Scaphirhynhus_, which occurs in the Ohio and Mississippi, and which\r\nforms a most natural link with the family of _Goniodonts_, all the\r\nspecies of which are confined exclusively to the fresh waters of\r\nCentral and South America. The closeness of this connection will be at\r\nonce perceived by attempting to compare the species of true\r\n_Sonicariæ_ with the _Scaphirhynhus_. I know very well, that the\r\naffinities of _Goniodonts_ and _Siluroids_ with sturgeons are denied,\r\nbut I still strongly insist upon their close relationship, which I\r\nhope to establish satisfactorily in a special paper, as I continued to\r\ninsist upon the relation between sturgeons and gar-pikes, at one time\r\npositively contradicted and even ridiculed. I trust then to be able to\r\nshew, that the remarkable form of the brains of _Siluridæ_ comes\r\nnearer to that of sturgeons and _Lepidostei_ than to that of any other\r\nfamily of fishes. This being the case, it is obvious that there must\r\nbe in the physical condition of the continent of America some\r\ninducement not yet understood, for adaptations so special and so\r\ndifferent from what we observe in the Old World. Indeed, such\r\nanalogies between the organized beings almost from one pole to\r\nanother, occur from man down to the plants in America only, among its\r\nnative products; while, in the Old World, plants as well as animals\r\nhave more circumscribed homes, and more closely characterized\r\nfeatures, in the various continents, at different latitudes.\r\n\r\nAs for the species of sturgeons which occur in the Canadian lakes, I\r\nknow only three from personal examination, one of which was obtained\r\nin Lake Superior, at Michipicotin, another at the Pic, and the third\r\nat the Sault; though I know that they occur in all other Canadian\r\nlakes, yet it remains to be ascertained how the species said to be so\r\ncommon in Lake Huron, compared with those of Lake Superior, and with\r\nthose in the other great lakes and the St Lawrence itself. As for the\r\nAtlantic species, ascending the rivers of the United States west and\r\nsouth of Cape Cod, I know them to differ from those of the lakes, at\r\nleast from those which I possess from Lake Superior. The number of\r\nspecies of this interesting family which occur in the United States\r\nis, at all events, far greater than would be supposed from an\r\nexamination of the published records. Upon close comparison of the\r\nspecimens in my collection from different parts of the country,\r\nand in different museums, as those of the Natural History Society of\r\nBoston, of Salem, of the Lyceum of New York, my assistant, Mr Charles\r\nGiran, and myself, have discovered several species not described. For\r\nthis comparison I was the better prepared, as I had an opportunity in\r\nformer years of studying almost all the European species in a fresh\r\ncondition, during a prolonged visit in Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\n   II.--_Fishes of Lake Superior compared with those of the other\r\n        great Canadian Lakes._\r\n\r\nBesides the interest there is everywhere in studying the living\r\nanimals of a new country, there is a particular interest to a\r\nnaturalist in ascertaining their peculiar geographical distribution,\r\nand their true affinities with those of other countries. It is only by\r\nfollowing such a course, that we can hope to arrive at any exact\r\nresults as to their origin. In this respect the fresh-water animals\r\nhave a peculiar interest, as from the element they inhabit, they are\r\nplaced under exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\nMarine animals, as well as those inhabiting dry land, seem to have a\r\nboundless opportunity before them to spread over large parts of the\r\nearth's surface, and their locomotive powers would generally be\r\nsufficient to carry them almost anywhere; but they do not avail\r\nthemselves of the possibility; notwithstanding their facilities for\r\nlocomotion, they for the most part remain within very narrow limits,\r\nusing their liberty rather to keep within certain definite bounds.\r\nThis tendency of the higher animals especially, to keep within\r\nwell-ascertained limits, is perhaps the strongest evidence that there\r\nis a natural connection between the external world and the organised\r\nbeings living upon the present surface of our globe. The laws which\r\nregulate these relations, and those of geographical distribution in\r\nparticular, have already been ascertained to a certain extent, and\r\nwill receive additional evidence from the facts recorded during our\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water animals are placed in somewhat different\r\ncircumstances. Their abode being circumscribed by dry land, within\r\nlimits which are often reduced to a narrow current of water, and being\r\nfurther, for the most part, prevented by structural peculiarities from\r\npassing from the rivers into the ocean, they are confined within\r\nnarrower limits than either terrestrial or marine types. Within these\r\nlimits again they are still further restricted; the shells and fishes\r\nof the head waters of large rivers, for instance, being scarcely ever\r\nthe same as those of their middle or lower course, few species\r\nextending all over any fresh-water basin from one extreme of its\r\nboundary to the other; thus forming at various heights above the level\r\nof the sea, isolated groups of fresh-water animals in the midst of\r\nthose which inhabit the dry land. These groups are very similar in\r\ntheir circumscription to the islands and coral reefs of the ocean;\r\nlike them, they are either large or small, isolated and far apart, or\r\nclose together in various modes of association. In every respect they\r\nform upon the continents, as it were, a counterpart of the\r\nArchipelagos.\r\n\r\nFrom their circumscription, these groups of lakes present at once a\r\npeculiar feature in the animal kingdom, their inhabitants being\r\nentirely unconnected with any of the other living beings which swarm\r\naround them. What, for instance, is there apparently in common between\r\nthe fishes of our lakes and rivers, and the quadrupeds which inhabit\r\ntheir shores, or the birds perching on the branches which overshadow\r\ntheir waters? Or what connection is there between the few hermit-like\r\nterrestrial animals that live upon the low islands of the Pacific and\r\nthe fishes which play among the corals, or in the sand and mud of\r\ntheir shores? And nevertheless there is but one plan in the creation;\r\nfresh-water animals under similar latitudes are as uniform as the\r\ncorresponding vegetation, and however isolated and apparently\r\nunconnected the tropical islands may seem, their inhabitants agree in\r\ntheir most important traits.\r\n\r\nThe best evidence that in the plan of creation animals are intended to\r\nbe located within circumscribed boundaries, is further derived from\r\ntheir regular migrations. Although the arctic birds wander during\r\nwinter into temperate countries, and some reach even the warmer zones;\r\nalthough there are many which, from the colder temperate climates,\r\nextend quite into the tropics, there is nevertheless not one of these\r\nspecies which passes from the northern to the southern hemispheres;\r\nnot one which does not return at regular epochs to the countries\r\nwhence it came from. And the more minutely we trace this geographical\r\ndistribution, the more we are impressed with the conviction that it\r\nmust be primitive; that is to say, that animals must have originated\r\nwhere they live, and have remained almost precisely within the same\r\nlimits ever since they were created, except in a few cases, where,\r\nunder the influence of man, those limits have been extended over large\r\nareas. To express this view still more distinctly, I should say the\r\nquestion to be settled is, whether for instance the wild animals which\r\nlive in America originated in this continent, or migrated into it from\r\nother parts of the world; whether the black bear was created in the\r\nforests of New England and the northern states, or whether it is\r\nderived from some European bear, which by some means found its way to\r\nthis continent, and being under the influence of a new climate,\r\nproduced a new race; whether the many peculiar birds of North America\r\nwhich live in forests composed of trees different from those which\r\noccur either in Europe or Asia, whether these birds, which themselves\r\nare not identical with those of any other country, were or were not\r\ncreated where they live; whether the snapping turtle, the alligator,\r\nthe rattlesnake, and other reptiles which are found only in America,\r\nhave become extinct in the Old World after migrating over the\r\nAtlantic, to be preserved in this continent; whether the fishes of the\r\ngreat Canadian lakes made their appearance first in those waters, or\r\nmigrated thither from somewhere else? These are questions which such\r\nan inquiry into the geographical distribution of animals involves; it\r\nis the great question of the unity or plurality of creations; it is\r\nnot less the question of the origin of animals from single pairs or in\r\nlarge numbers; and, strange to say, a thorough examination of the\r\nfishes of Lake Superior, compared with those of the adjacent waters,\r\nis likely to throw more light upon such questions, than all\r\ntraditions, however ancient, however near in point of time to the\r\nepoch of creation itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to proceed methodically in this investigation, our first step\r\nmust be to examine minutely, whether the fishes of Lake Superior are\r\nthe same as those of other lakes, in this or any other country; and,\r\nif not, how they differ. To satisfy ourselves in this respect, we\r\nshall successively examine all the families of fishes, which have\r\nrepresentatives in those great fresh-water seas. (_Agassiz on Lake\r\nSuperior_, p. 246.) Professor Agassiz, after admirable histories of\r\nthe fishes of Lake Superior, concludes with the following excellent\r\nobservations:--[3]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 3: \"Lake Superior,\" p. 373.\r\n\r\n\r\n  III.--_General Observations; all Fresh-water Fishes of North America\r\n        different from those of Europe--Lake Superior and the\r\n        Lakes north of it constitute a distinct Zoological District--These\r\n        Fishes have been created where they now live--Deductions\r\n        from this fact._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a critical revision of the fishes of Lake Superior, and the other\r\ngreat Canadian lakes, was the first necessary step in the\r\ninvestigation I am tracing, in order to ascertain the natural\r\nprimitive relations between them and the region which they inhabit.\r\nBefore drawing the conclusions which follow directly from these facts,\r\nI should introduce a similar list of the fishes living in similar\r\nlatitudes, or under similar circumstances, in other parts of the\r\nworld; and more particularly of the species of Northern Europe. But\r\nsuch a list, to be of any use, should be throughout based upon a\r\ncritical comparative investigation of all the species of that\r\ncontinent, which would lead to too great a digression. The comparison\r\nof the fresh-water fishes of Europe, which correspond to those of\r\nNorth America, has been carried so far, that I feel justified in\r\nassuming, what is really the fact, that all the species of North\r\nAmerica, without a single exception, differ from those of Europe, if\r\nwe limit ourselves strictly to fishes which are exclusively the\r\ninhabitants of fresh water.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the salmon which runs up the rivers of Northern\r\nand Central Europe, also occurs on the eastern shores of the northern\r\npart of North America, and runs up the rivers emptying into the\r\nAtlantic. But this fish is one of the marine arctic fishes, which\r\nmigrates with many others, annually further south, and which migratory\r\nspecies is common to both continents. Those species, however, which\r\nnever leave the fresh waters, are, without exception, different on the\r\ntwo continents. Again, on each of the continents, they differ in\r\nvarious latitudes; some, however, taking a wider range than others in\r\ntheir natural geographical distribution.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water fishes of North America, which form a part of its\r\ntemperate fauna, extend over very considerable ground; for there is no\r\nreason to subdivide into distinct faunæ the extensive tracts of lands\r\nbetween the arctics and the Middle States of the Union. We notice over\r\nthese, considerable uniformity in the character of the fresh-water\r\nfishes. Nevertheless, a minute investigation of all their species has\r\nshewn that Lake Superior proper, and the fresh waters north of it,\r\nconstitute in many respects a special zoological district,\r\nsufficiently different from that of the lower lakes and the northern\r\nUnited States, to form a natural division in the great fauna of the\r\nfresh-water fishes of the temperate zone of this continent.\r\n\r\nWe have shewn that there are types, occurring in all the lower lakes,\r\nwhich never occur in Lake Superior and northwards, and that most of\r\nthe species found in Lake Superior are peculiar to it; the Salmonidæ\r\nonly taking a wider range, and some of them covering almost the whole\r\nextent of that fauna, while others appear circumscribed within very\r\nnarrow limits.\r\n\r\nNow, such differences in the range which the isolated species take in\r\nthe faunæ, is a universal character of the distribution of animals;\r\nsome species of certain families covering, without distinction,\r\nextensive grounds, which are occupied by several species of other\r\nfamilies, limited to particular districts of the same zone.\r\n\r\nBut after making due allowance for such variations, and taking a\r\ngeneral view of the subject, we arrive, nevertheless, at this\r\nconclusion; that all the fresh-water fishes of the district under\r\nexamination are peculiar to that district, and occur nowhere else in\r\nany other part of the world.\r\n\r\nThey have their analogues in other continents, but nowhere beyond the\r\nlimits of the American continent do we find any fishes identical with\r\nthose of the district, the fauna of which we have been recently\r\nsurveying. The lamprey eels of the lake district have very close\r\nrepresentatives in Europe, but they cannot be identified. The\r\nsturgeons of this continent are neither identical with those of Europe\r\nnor with those of Asia. The cat-fishes are equally different. We find\r\na similar analogy and similar differences between the perches,\r\npickerels, eelpouts, salmons, and carps. In all the families which\r\noccur throughout the temperate zone, there are near relatives on the\r\ntwo continents, but they do not belong to the same stock. And in\r\naddition to these, there are also types which are either entirely\r\npeculiar to the American continent, such as Lepidosteus and Percopsis,\r\nor belong to genera which have not simultaneous representatives in the\r\ntwo worlds, and are therefore more or less remote from those which\r\nhave such close analogues. The family of Percoids, for instance, has\r\nseveral genera in Europe, which have no representatives in America;\r\nand several genera in America which have no representatives in Europe,\r\nbesides genera which are represented on both continents, though by\r\nrepresentatives specifically distinct.\r\n\r\nSuch facts have an important bearing upon the history of creation; and\r\nit would be very unphilosophical to adhere to any view respecting its\r\nplan, which would not embrace these facts, and grant them their full\r\nmeaning. If we face the fundamental question which is at the bottom of\r\nthis particular distribution of animals, and ask ourselves, where have\r\nall these fishes been created, there can be but one answer given which\r\nwill not be in conflict and direct contradiction with the facts\r\nthemselves, and the laws that regulate animal life. The fishes, and\r\nall other fresh-water animals of the region of the great lakes, must\r\nhave been created where they live. They are circumscribed within\r\nboundaries over which they cannot pass, and to which there is no\r\nnatural access from other quarters. There is no trace of their having\r\nextended further in their geographical distribution at any former\r\nperiod, nor of their having been limited within narrower boundaries.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be rational to suppose that they were created in some other\r\npart of the world, and were transferred to this continent, to die away\r\nin the region where they are supposed to have originated, and to\r\nmultiply in the region where they are found. There is no reason why we\r\nshould not take the present evidence in their distribution as the\r\nnatural fact respecting their origin, and that they are, and were from\r\nthe beginning, best suited for the country where they are now found.\r\n\r\nMoreover, they bear to the species which inhabit similar regions, and\r\nlive under similar circumstances in Europe and Asia, and the Pacific\r\nside of this continent, such relations, that they appear to the\r\nphilosophical observer as belonging to a plan which has been carried\r\nout in its details with reference to the general arrangement. The\r\nspecies of Europe, Asia, and the Pacific side of this continent,\r\ncorrespond in their general combination to the species of the eastern\r\nand northern parts of the American continent, all over which the same\r\ngeneral types are extended. They correspond to each other on the\r\nwhole, but differ as to species.\r\n\r\nAnd again, this temperate fauna has such reference to the fauna of the\r\narctic, and to that of the warmer zones, that any transposition of\r\nisolated members of the whole plan would disturb the harmony which is\r\nevidently maintained throughout the natural distribution of organized\r\nbeings all over the world. This internal evidence of an intentional\r\narrangement, having direct reference to the present geographical\r\ndistribution of the animals, dispersed over the whole surface of our\r\nglobe, shews most conclusively, that they have been created where they\r\nare now found. Denying this position were equivalent to denying that\r\nthe creation has been made according to a wise plan. It were denying\r\nto the Creator the intention of establishing well-regulated natural\r\nrelations between the beings he has called into existence. It were\r\ndenying him the wisdom which is exemplified in nature, to ascribe it\r\nto the creatures themselves,--to ascribe it even to those creatures in\r\nwhich we hardly see evidence of consciousness, or, worse than all, to\r\nascribe this wonderful order to physical influence or mere chance.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this general conclusion is granted, there are, however,\r\nsome further adaptations which follow as a matter of course. Each\r\ntype, being created within the limits of the natural area which it is\r\nto inhabit, must have been placed there under circumstances favourable\r\nto its preservation and reproduction, and adapted to the fulfilment of\r\nthe purposes for which it was created. There are in animals peculiar\r\nadaptations which are characteristic of their species, and which\r\ncannot be supposed to have arisen from subordinate influences. Those\r\nwhich live in shoals cannot be supposed to have been created in single\r\npairs. Those which are made to be the food of others cannot have been\r\ncreated in the same proportions as those which feed upon them. Those\r\nwhich are everywhere found in innumerable specimens, must have been\r\nintroduced in numbers capable of maintaining their normal proportions\r\nto those which live isolated, and are comparatively and constantly\r\nfewer. For we know that this harmony in the numerical proportions\r\nbetween animals is one of the great laws of nature. The circumstance\r\nthat species occur within definite limits where no obstacles prevent\r\ntheir wider distribution, leads to the further inference that these\r\nlimits were assigned to them from the beginning and so we would come\r\nto the final conclusion, that the order which prevails throughout the\r\ncreation is intentional,--that it is regulated by the limits marked\r\nout on the first day of creation,--and that it has been maintained\r\nunchanged through ages, with no other modifications than those which\r\nthe higher intellectual powers of man enable him to impose upon some\r\nof the few animals more closely connected with him, and in reference\r\nto those very limited changes which he is able to produce artificially\r\nupon the surface of our globe.[4]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 4: The above view of the geography of animals appeared\r\n     partly in an American periodical and partly in Professor\r\n     Agassiz's beautiful and important work (just received) on Lake\r\n     Superior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      _On the Geography and Geology of the Peninsula of Mount\r\n                Sinai, and the adjacent Countries._\r\n                By JOHN HOGG, M.A., F.R.S., F.L.S.;\r\n            Honorary Secretary of the Royal Geographical\r\n              Society, &c.

On the shore is placed\r\nthe town _Aïlas_, where, the sea ending, it is contracted into a very\r\nnarrow bay.\"\r\n\r\n     Footnote 5: _Procopii_ de Bell. Pers., lib. i., cap. 19.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 6: _Procop._ de Ædificiis Justiniani, lib. v., cap, 8.\r\n     Tom. ii. Edit. _Par._ 1663.\r\n\r\nEdrisi, in the 12th century, terms the steep descent from the Desert\r\nEl Tyh by El Nakb to Akaba--\"Akaba Ailah\"--_i.e._, the \"Descent of\r\nAilah;\" and Makrisi, in the 14th century, as cited by Burckhardt (p.\r\n511), speaks of \"the _Akaba_, or steep mountain _before Aila_.\"\r\nConsequently, I take it to be correct that these _mounds_ indicate the\r\nformer position of _Elath_,[7] on the shore of the Sea of Edom or\r\nIdumea--an arm of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 7: Ailah was in the middle ages considered (Robinson,\r\n     i., p. 252, and Lepsius' Tour, p. 20), as _Elim_, the sixth\r\n     station of the Israelites after they passed the Red Sea. But I\r\n     apprehend that the error very likely arose from the word Ailam\r\n     occurring in the _Alexandrine MS._, (2 Kings xvi. 6; and 2 Chron.\r\n     viii. 17), for Ailath, which is used in the LXX., in those\r\n     verses. So Ailam had here been _mistaken_ for Aileim, _Elim_, the\r\n     word which is found in Exodus, xvi. 1; of the LXX.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from them, but westward, a large space, like a\r\nmarsh, seemed to be impregnated with _nitre_, which is left incrusted\r\nin some spots upon their surface. From hence, going up the extensive\r\nvalley El Araba, it is found to be full of sand drifts, with here and\r\nthere a few trees scattered about; the torrents, after rain, flow\r\nalong the west side, and their waters, which are _not absorbed_ by the\r\n_sand_, enter the sea at the north-west angle. The width of this part\r\nof the Wadi is near 5 miles, but in advancing farther to the north it\r\nbecomes wider. The mountains on the east are high--from 2000 to 2500\r\nfeet; being of _granitic_, or rather _porphyritic_ formation, they are\r\nhighly picturesque, and have fine, lofty, jagged peaks: but those on\r\nthe west, which are _sandstone_ and _chalk_, are lower; rising to\r\nabout a level with the desert El Tyh, they do not exceed 1500, or in\r\nplaces 1800 feet in elevation.\r\n\r\nNot far from Wadi Ghadyan,[8] towards the west side, a great\r\nmarsh-like tract, apparently impregnated with _nitre_, exhibits an\r\nincrustation on its surface. And the water in the spring itself is,\r\naccording to _M. De Bertou_, strong of _sulphur_.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 8: How Robinson could suppose that this might afford a\r\n     _trace_ of Eziongaber, I cannot imagine. See Bib. Res., vol. i.,\r\n     pp. 251, 268.\r\n\r\nPassing the opening of Wadi Beianeh, and still ascending, the most\r\nelevated table-land or small plateau of the Wadi-El-Araba is reached\r\nat about the line of 30° north latitude, and 35° 15' east longitude\r\nnearly, which is very near 500 feet higher than the level of the Gulf\r\nof Akaba, according to _Herr Schubert_. About that point the\r\n_water-shed_ occurs; some of the waters of the Araba flow south into\r\nthe sea of Akaba, but most are carried off north by the tributaries of\r\nthe Wadi-el-Jeib into the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nThe same traveller (_Schubert_) found the depression of the bed of\r\nthat deep Wadi at about 4 miles south of El Weibeh (\"hole with\r\nwater,\") to be 91 Paris feet, or 97 English feet _below_ the level of\r\nthe Red Sea; the commencement, or most southern limit of that\r\ndepression taking place at about 15 miles northward of Gebel Harun in\r\nWadi-el-Araba. Consequently, the Dead Sea, Asphaltic Lake (_Bahr\r\nLut_)--the \"Sea of Lot\"--must lie considerably _lower_ than the level\r\nof the Gulf of Akaba; indeed, _Herr Schubert_ gives the level of the\r\n_Dead Sea_ as being 598 Paris feet, and M. Russegger even more than\r\n1300 English feet _below_ that of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThese geographical facts then afford, as some authors have supposed,\r\nsufficient evidence that the River Jordan, although taking its source\r\nat an elevation of 1800 feet in the north Syrian mountains--_has not_\r\nflowed through the entire valley _El Araba_ into the Gulf of Akaba; or\r\nrather, into the Red Sea, beyond what is now the Strait of Tiran. And\r\ncertainly these facts are _decisive_ that it _never has done so_--if\r\nthe natural conformation of this region has _always_ been the _same_,\r\nas it now exists with regard to _depth_ and _height_. But against its\r\nhaving continued the _same_, _ab initio_, up to the present time, much\r\nreasonable hypothesis, and several remarkable appearances may be\r\nfairly advanced.\r\n\r\nOf the latter, some are the _volcanic_ phenomena apparent around the\r\nDead Sea and El Ghor,[9] on the north; in the basaltic cliffs and\r\ncreeks nearly opposite the Isle of Kureiyeh; the frequent\r\ndisplacements of strata and rocks in many places on the north-west\r\nside of the Gulf of Akaba; the coincidences exhibited by the strata in\r\nthe Isle of Tiran, with those of the Arabian and Sinaic shores; and\r\nthe volcanic remains and crater-like hills between them and Sherm on\r\nthe south. Moreover, it may be collected from Scripture, that certain\r\n_changes_ had actually been _effected_ in the vicinity of the _Dead\r\nSea_ (Gen. xix. 25); and that they were caused by _fire_ (_Ibid._\r\nxxiv. 28); if then, at that period, the southern part of the valley of\r\nthe Jordan, the plain of the Dead Sea, and El Ghor had, through\r\nigneous, or volcanic, or other agency, _sunk_ much _below_ their\r\nformer levels, it is possible that a corresponding _elevation_ of the\r\nland in _Wadi-el-Araba_ might have taken place at the same (or perhaps\r\nat another) time, by the same (or by a subsequent similar) agency.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 9: _Ghor_ signifies \"a long _valley_ between two\r\n     mountains.\" Refer to some of these _volcanic_ indications, p. 122\r\n     of _Dr Kitto's_ \"Physical Geography of the Holy Land.\" El Ghor,\r\n     on the south of the Dead Sea, abounding in _salt_, is most\r\n     probably \"the _valley_ of salt\" mentioned in 2 Kings xiv. 7.\r\n\r\nAgain, it seems probable from Scripture, that the _Dead Sea_ and\r\n_Wadi-el-Araba_ had been once continued, or more connected in their\r\nlevels; because in Joshua iii. 16, and xii. 3, the former is called\r\n\"the _sea of the plain_ (even) the Salt Sea;\" and in Deut. iv. 49,\r\nonly \"the _sea of the plain_;\" the original Hebrew expression in all\r\nthree verses is, \"Yam ha Arabah;\" that is, the _Sea of the Araba_; and\r\nthe Septuagint renders it hê thalassa Araba. \"Ha Arabah,\" in Hebrew,\r\nsignifies the same as _El Arabah_ in Arabic--a \"desert-plain,\" or a\r\n\"plain.\" So, likewise, we find in Deut. ii. 8, \"the children of Edom\"\r\ndescribed as dwelling \"in Seir, through the way of the _Plain_ from\r\nElath, and from Eziongaber;\" the Hebrew and Greek words for _the\r\nplain_ are here also the same, viz., \"_Arabah_.\" Consequently, these\r\npassages from Scripture, shewing that _both extremes_, north and\r\nsouth, of this great _plain_ or _Wadi_, bore the _same_ appellation,\r\nprove that it was esteemed one _entire_ valley in its _whole extent_,\r\nfrom the Dead, or Salt Sea, to Elath and Eziongaber on the Red Sea, or\r\nÆlanitic Gulf, in the land of Edom (1 Kings ix. 26, and 2 Chron. viii.\r\n17.) And, indeed, according to Dr Robertson, _no_ such _division_ of\r\nit, as _M. De Bertou_ and some other travellers assert, into\r\n_Wadi-el-Akaba_, and _Wadi-el-Araba_,[10] at this day exists.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 10: See _M. De Bertou's_ paper in the \"Journal of the\r\n     Royal Geographical Society,\" vol. ix., p. 282.\r\n\r\nAfter having attained the highest point, or short table-land of the\r\nWadi-el-Araba, the descent in fact begins in a direct line nearly due\r\nnorth to the Dead Sea; it is in places more elevated, rougher, and\r\nmore sandy than in others; and its width also becomes greater.\r\nGebel-el-Beianeh appears the _loftiest_ of the chain on the west; but\r\nthis is scarcely two-thirds as _high_ as the east range,\r\nGebel-el-Shera (_Mount Seir_); the former is entirely sterile and\r\narid, whilst the latter is covered with herbs and occasional trees,\r\nand seems to have a sufficiency of rain. The east _Wadis_ also, which\r\nare numerous, are filled with trees, shrubs, and flowers; and their\r\neastern and _higher_ portions, being well cultivated, yield good\r\ncrops. So Strabo, calling the district \"Nabathæa,\" states it _abounded\r\nin pastures_; hê Nabataia polyandros ousa hê chôra kai eubotos;[11]\r\nand being the country of Esau, it was \"of the fatness of the earth,\r\nand of the dew of heaven from above.\"--_Gen._ xxvii. 39.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 11: _Strabo Geog._, vol. ii., lib. 16-35, p. 1103. Edit.\r\n     _Falconer_.\r\n\r\nThe range of Mount Seir, _Gebel-el-Shera_, _i.e._, the mountains of a\r\n\"region\" or \"tract,\" under which I have only included those mountains,\r\ncommencing with Mount _Seir_ itself on the north, and extending to\r\nGebel-el-Ithm on the south. On the eastern side is now _sandstone_,\r\nveined with _oxide of iron_; and those mountains still further to the\r\neast, forming a part of the Nabathæan chain, are _limestone_ with\r\n_flints_, of the same _cretaceous_ series as that of the Sinaic\r\nPeninsula; they present many varied forms and shapes.\r\n\r\nEl Araba, in the approach to Wadi Gharandel, is more covered with\r\nshifting sands, broken by innumerable undulations, and low hills; into\r\nthese sands the waters of Wadi Gharandel, which, according to\r\nBurckhardt, have a _sulphureous_ taste, lose themselves. In the ascent\r\nof this Wadi (Gharandel) towards Gebel Kula, a mountain is climbed\r\nwhich is composed of _calcareous_ rocks, _sandstone_ and _flints_,\r\nlying over each other in horizontal layers. Gebel Kula is covered on\r\nits summit, with a _chalky_ surface. But in Wadi Dalegheh the\r\nmountains are _calcareous_, with some _flints_, and perfectly bare.\r\n\r\nEast of these valleys, and distant about six miles, are said to be the\r\nvestiges of a Roman road, which probably led near Usdaka--the\r\n_Szadeke_ of Burckhardt--to Petra. Near that place is a hill with some\r\nconsiderable ruins, very possibly the remains of what the Peutingerian\r\nTable calls _Zadagasta_; which word seems to have been corrupted into\r\n_Zadeka_, and _Sudaka_, or _Usdaka_. A fine spring, or _Ain_, is there\r\nmuch noted. Also, further north five or six miles, at Ain Mefrak, some\r\nruins are visible. And the same traveller noticed, a few miles north\r\nof the present picturesque village of Eljy--situate a little east of\r\nPetra, in a more fertile spot--the substructions of walls and paved\r\nroads, all constructed of flints. The present road, traversed by the\r\n_Hadj_, or pilgrims, from Syria to Mecca, passes about five miles more\r\neastwards, through Maan (_Maon_, Judges x. 12), placed in a rocky\r\ndistrict. This town is divided by two hills, on each of which stands a\r\nportion of it. The fruits, especially pomegranates, peaches, apricots,\r\nand grapes, are there excellent, and are much sought after by the\r\nSyrian pilgrims. Burckhardt (p. 436), says here, \"are several\r\n_springs_, to which the town owes its _origin_;\" and I presume the\r\nword itself, Ma'an, is abbreviated by use from _Mayan_, signifying a\r\n\"fountain.\"\r\n\r\n_Fourthly._--\"Petra,\" the Greek appellation of the capital of the\r\nancient _Nabathæa_, or territory of the Nabathæi, and the _Edom_ of\r\nScripture, was called in Hebrew, _Sela_; both words meaning a \"rock,\"\r\nand the first of which gave _its name_ to the country--\"Arabia\r\n_Petræa_.\" It is also called _Joktheel_, in 2 Kings xiv. 7. Strabo has\r\ndistinctly recorded that \"Petra was the capital of the _Nabathæans who\r\nwere Idumæans_.\" (Lib. xvi.) The former appellation having been\r\nbestowed upon this people as descendants of _Nebaioth_, (1 Chron. i.\r\n29), or _Nebajoth_ (Gen. xxv. 13), who was Abraham and Hagar's\r\ngrandson, and Ishmael's first-born son. Petra is correctly described\r\nby the same Greek geographer, as well as by the Roman naturalist. The\r\nshort account of the last I here transcribe: \"Nabatæi oppidum\r\n_includunt Petram_ nomine in _convalle_, paulo minus duum mill.\r\npassuum amplitudinis, _circumdatum montibus_ inaccessis _amne\r\ninterfluente_.\"[12] I will not add here any description of the very\r\nmagnificent remains of this remarkable city, the city of the\r\n_Rock_--or rather excavated and carved out of the _natural\r\nrock_--whose dwellings are said to have been \"in the clefts of the\r\n_rock_,\" (Obadiah 3), since they are now so well known.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 12: _Plin._ Nat. Hist., Lib. vi., cap. 28.\r\n\r\nComing to Petra from Eljy, on the east, the body of the regular\r\nmountain on that side is limestone, and higher than the red sandstone,\r\nwhere the tombs in Wadi Mousa are excavated. The cliffs at Petra are\r\nof _red sandstone_, which is soft and easily cut, causing the\r\nsculptures to decay quickly, unless where they may have been\r\n_protected_ from the weather. This formation extends far to the north\r\nand south, and rests on the lower masses of porphyry.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the _sandstone_ rocks in Wadi Mousa is not a dull\r\nmonotonous _red_, but a variety of bright hues, \"from the deepest\r\ncrimson,\" as Dr Robinson writes (vol. ii., p. 531), \"to the softest\r\npink; verging also sometimes to orange and yellow. These varying\r\nshades are often distinctly marked by waving lines, imparting to the\r\nsurface of the rock a succession of brilliant and changing tints, like\r\nthe hues of watered silk, and adding greatly to the imposing effect of\r\nthe sculptured monuments.\"\r\n\r\nThe site of Petra, in the high ravine, is called by the Arabs, Wadi\r\n_Mousa_; most likely corrupted from _Moseroth_, or _Mosera_ (Deut. x.\r\n6), \"where Aaron died and was buried.\" It is extremely interesting,\r\nand is well watered by a flowing stream--the _El Syk_ of Burckhardt.\r\nThe _sandstone_ rocks, with their craggy and precipitous sides, have\r\ntheir summits resembling rounded peaks; peaks, probably owing to the\r\nsoftness of the stone, rounded by the effects of weather. The height\r\nof this _Wadi_ is estimated at near 2200 feet above the adjoining\r\nWadi-el-Araba. To the west of Petra, Mount Hor, Gebel _Harun_\r\nconstitutes the loftiest point of this _sandstone_ tract. It stands\r\nout conspicuously, and is a _cone_ irregularly truncated with three\r\nrugged peaks, of which that to the NE. is the _highest_, and has upon\r\nit the Mahommetan _Wely_; or the tomb of _Aaron_, called _Neby Harun_.\r\nThis peak rises to about 2700 feet above Wadi _Mousa_, or to 5300 feet\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nCaptains Irby and Mangles, the _first_ Europeans who ascended Gebel\r\n_Harun_, thus describe \"the view from the summit.\" It \"is extremely\r\nextensive in every direction; but the eye rests on few objects which\r\nit can clearly distinguish, and give a name to, although an excellent\r\nidea is obtained of the general face and features of the country. The\r\nchain of Idumean mountains, which form the western shore of the Dead\r\nSea, seem to run on to the south, though losing considerably in their\r\nheight. They appear in this point of view, barren and desolate. Below\r\nthem is spread out a white sandy plain, seamed with the beds of\r\noccasional torrents, and presenting much the same features as the most\r\ndesert parts of the Ghor. Where this desert expanse approaches the\r\nfoot of Mount Hor, there arise out of it, like islands, several lower\r\npeaks and ridges, of a purple colour, probably composed of the same\r\nkind of _sandstone_ as that of Mount Hor itself, which, variegated as\r\nit is in its hues, presents in the distance one uniform mass of dark\r\npurple. Towards the Egyptian side there is an expanse of country\r\nwithout features or limit, and lost in the distance. The lofty\r\ndistrict which we had quitted in our descent to Wadi Mousa, shuts up\r\nthe prospect on the south-east side; but there is no part of the\r\nlandscape which the eye wanders over with more curiosity and delight\r\nthan the crags of Mount Hor itself, which stand up on every side, in\r\nthe most rugged and fantastic forms, sometimes strangely piled one on\r\nthe other, and sometimes as strangely yawning in clefts of a frightful\r\ndepth.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the term _Nabathæan Chain_, or the chain of the mountains of\r\nEdom, I have restricted those mountains beginning north of 30° N.\r\nLat., and which then tend round northward, by the east of Petra. They\r\nare the loftiest on the east, attaining probably to an altitude of\r\n3000 feet above the Wadi-el-Araba. This chain presents to the view, on\r\nthe east, long elevated ranges of _limestone_, sometimes with\r\n_flints_, but of more easy slopes, _without_ precipices, being smooth\r\nand rounded. Further still to the east, the high plateau of the Great\r\nEastern Desert--of which _El Nejd_ is a portion--stretches out to an\r\nalmost indefinite extent. To the west and north, and around Mount\r\n_Hor_, lofty party-coloured _sandstone_ ridges and cliffs prevail;\r\nthen succeed high masses of _porphyry_, constituting the body of the\r\nmountains, but _lower_ than the _sandstone_. And, lastly, more\r\nnorthwards, the chain sinks down into low hills of _argillaceous_\r\nrock, or of _limestone_.\r\n\r\nThe entire breadth of the _Seir_ range seems not to exceed eighteen\r\nEnglish miles, between Wadi-el-Araba and the Eastern Desert; whilst\r\nthat of the more northern, or _Nabathæan chain_, does not exceed\r\ntwenty-two miles between those districts.\r\n\r\nGoing west from Petra, the valley of the _Araba_ is again entered,\r\nwhere the deeper _Wadi-el-Jeib_ is seen to wind along, very near the\r\nmiddle of it, from the south, then sweeping off NW., it meets the\r\n_Wadi-el-Jerafah_, which comes in from the SW. Afterwards, it is\r\ncalled only _Wadi-el-Jeib_; and being a deep valley within a larger\r\nvalley, it forms the chief water-course of the greater portion of the\r\nAraba, and carries down to the Dead Sea, in the wet season, an immense\r\nbody of water.\r\n\r\nEl Araba, more to the north of Gebel Harun, is much wider; in parts of\r\nit there are _gravel_ hills; and here and there, masses of _porphyry_\r\nlie about in the sand, having been washed down by the torrents. Eleven\r\nor twelve miles north of that Mount (_Hor_), occurs the pass of\r\n_Nemela_ among low hills of _limestone_, or rather a yellowish\r\n_argillaceous_ rock, the dark steep mass of the mountain being\r\n_porphyry_, as before described; thence the Wadi ascends between the\r\nporphyry and limestone formations; and on the top is a little basin of\r\n_yellow sandstone_ capping the _porphyry_.\r\n\r\nComing back southward through the Wadi-el-Araba, as far as\r\nthe _embouchure_ of the valley of the _Jerafah_--meaning\r\n\"gullying,\"--which is about a mile wide, the mountains on this west\r\nside are found to be composed of _chalk_ and _limestone_; and, in many\r\nplaces, with large pieces of black _flint_.\r\n\r\nOn the north, and to the east of Lussan, the mountains of Idumæa are\r\nlofty, consisting of precipitous _limestone_ ranges; the solitary\r\nconical mount, about 600 feet above the plain, named _Gebel\r\nAraif-el-Naka_--\"the crest of a she-camel,\" forms a conspicuous\r\nobject; it is _calcareous_, and strewed with _flints_. Low ridges\r\nextend from it westward and eastward; the latter terminating in a\r\nheadland or bluff, called Gebel _Makrah_.\r\n\r\nThe wide sandy _Wadi-el-Ghudhagidh_--the _Ghudhaghidh_ of Robinson--is\r\nprobably the _Gudgodah_; or, as it is written in Hebrew, _Ghudghodah_,\r\nmentioned in Deut. x. 7, whither the Israelites journeyed from Mosera\r\n(_Wadi Mousa_) after Aaron's death. After this valley were some low\r\n_chalky_ cliffs, and then succeeded a barren _flinty_ tract.\r\n\r\nTowards the NW. and W., a broad open district stretches out apparently\r\nto _Gebel Jaraf_, said to be 1300 feet above the sea level, through\r\nwhich is the course of the _Wadi Khereir_, elevated about 1000 feet at\r\nits nearest point to that mount, and flowing northward into the large\r\n_Wadi-el-Agaba_,--upon one side, and to _Gebel Yelak_, the \"white\r\nmountain,\" on the other side; but it is broken in some places by\r\n_limestone_ or _chalk_ hills.\r\n\r\nThe Wadi Ghudhagidh, and the more southern tributaries of the Jerafah,\r\nflow to the NE. to the Dead Sea, as already explained; and they, with\r\nsome smaller winter torrents that unite with them, are the only\r\nwater-courses in this part of _Arabia Petræa_ which supply that sea.\r\nOn the SE. of the upper Jerafah, some low _limestone_ ridges present\r\nthemselves; but, on the other side is the _sandy_ plain _El Adhbeh_:\r\nbeyond this, northwards, follows a level plain covered with pebbles\r\nand black _flints_. The high West Desert, called by the Arabs El Tyh,\r\nthe \"wandering,\" and so named in Edrisi and Abul-feda, near its centre\r\nat _Nakhl_, signifying \"date trees\" (at which station there exists a\r\ngrove of those trees), at an elevation of near 1500 feet above the\r\nsea, consists of vast plains, or _plateaux_ of varying, mostly higher,\r\naltitudes, a sandy, flinty, or gravelly soil, and limestone hills of\r\nthe _cretaceous_ or secondary formation, having very irregular ridges\r\ndisposed in different directions.\r\n\r\nThe numerous _Wadis_, or water-courses, and winter torrents of this\r\nenormous desert, all run to the N. or NW., and pour their waters into\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea; while those _Wadis_ that lie on the other side\r\nof the Great Mountain range, which bounds the desert in its western\r\nand southern extremities--_Gebel-el-Rahah_ and _Gebel-el-Tyh_--divide\r\ntheir waters, and so supply, in part, the Gulf of _Suez_, and in part\r\nthe Gulf of _Akaba_. Of the former _Wadis_, two are the principal;\r\nnamely, _Wadi-el-Agaba_, which rises somewhat to the east of the line\r\nof 34° E. long.; and _Wadi-el-Arish_, which Russegger and later\r\nauthors affirm as springing to the _west_ of it, and of _Gebels_\r\nHeiyalah, Yelak, and Mishea, and of which _Wadi Nesil_ seems to me to\r\nbe only a tributary.\r\n\r\nThe chain called _Gebel-el-Egmeh_, or _El Odjme_ by Burckhardt,\r\nappears, as he says, _chalky_; and such, also, is the soil of the\r\nplain, and frequently covered with _black_ pebbles (_flints_); it\r\nunites with the higher chain of the Gebel-el-Tyh, about the centre of\r\nthe Peninsula,--that is to say, of the _Peninsular Triangle_, and\r\nwhere the branches North-el-Tyh and South-el-Tyh separate. There the\r\nheight of the summit of _El Tyh_ is given by Russegger as 4322 Paris\r\nfeet, or 4615 English feet, above the sea; descending thence by the\r\npass of Mureikhi, into the sandy plain of _Debbet-el-Ramleh_, the\r\nelevation of that plateau, just about the middle of it, and about half\r\nway to the head of _Wadi-el-Sheikh_, is near 4000 feet above the sea\r\nlevel; Alahadar being a little to the east.\r\n\r\nIn the Wadi _El Sheikh_, meaning the \"Valley of the Elder,\" or\r\n\"Chief,\" which is one of the principal valleys in the Peninsula,\r\nbefore coming to \"Moses' seat\" (_Mokad Seidna Mousa_), occurs a range\r\nof low hills of a substance called _Taffal_, chiefly a detritus of the\r\n_felspar_ of _granite_, like pipe clay. The easiest approach to the\r\npresent Sinaic district is by the east side of this Wadi, which leads\r\ninto the wider Wadi, or plain _El Raha_, _i.e._, a \"plain surrounded\r\nby hills.\" The view of Gebels _El Deir_ (\"The Convent\"), the\r\nnow-termed _Horeb_, _Humer_ (red), and others, from thence is very\r\nstriking. The lower granitic mountains of the present _Sinai_ are more\r\nregularly shaped than the upper; being less rugged, they have _no_\r\ninsulated _peaks_; and their summits terminate in smooth _curves_.\r\nWhilst in the ascent to the higher mountains, _peaks on peaks arise_,\r\nof the form of sharp cones, and of various altitudes. _Gebel Mousa_,\r\nor \"Moses' Mount,\" is of _red granite_ for about half-way up; all the\r\nrest being a _yellowish granite_, with small _black_ grains, and from\r\n_Wadi Leja_ (\"asylum\"), these colours appear most distinct. The height\r\nof the apex of G. _Mousa_ peak, which does not exceed fifty yards in\r\nwidth, was ascertained by Lieutenant Wellsted, from the _mean_ of\r\nobservations, to be 7505 feet above the sea of Akaba; and that late,\r\nable, and lamented officer, who was upon that summit in _January_, and\r\n\"enjoyed the advantage of a clear serene atmosphere,\" which, in a more\r\nadvanced season of the year, would have been hazy, with a blue mist,\r\narising from the powerful sun, \"was thereby enabled, by means of\r\nangles taken to the hills on the Arabian coast, ninety miles distant,\r\nto correctly fix the geographical position of the mountain.\" He has\r\nalso well described the most extensive view from that peak, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  \"The Gulfs of Suez and Akaba are distinctly visible; from the\r\n  dark-blue waters of the latter, the island of _Tiran_, considered\r\n  by the ancient geographers as sacred to _Isis_,[13] rears itself.\r\n  Mount Agrib (_Garib_), on the other hand, points out 'the land of\r\n  bondage.' Before me is St _Catherine_, its bare, conical peak now\r\n  capped with snow. In magnificence and striking effect, few parts\r\n  of the world can surpass the wild, naked scenery everywhere met\r\n  with in the mountain-chain which girds the sea-coast of Arabia.\"\r\n  ... The monkish \"Mount _Sinai_ itself, and the hills which compose\r\n  the district in its immediate vicinity, rise in sharp, isolated,\r\n  conical peaks. From their steep and shattered sides huge masses\r\n  have been splintered, leaving fissures rather than valleys between\r\n  their remaining portions. These form the highest part of the range\r\n  of mountains that spread out over the Peninsula, and are very\r\n  generally, in the winter months, covered with snow, the melting of\r\n  which occasions the torrents which everywhere devastate the plains\r\n  below. The peculiarities of its _conical_ formation, render this\r\n  district yet more distinct from the adjoining heights that appear\r\n  in successive ridges beyond it, while the valleys which intersect\r\n  them are so narrow that few can be perceived. No villages and\r\n  castles, as in Europe, here animate the picture; no forests,\r\n  lakes, or falls of water, break the silence and monotony of the\r\n  scene. All has the appearance of a vast and desolate wilderness,\r\n  either grey, darkly-brown, or wholly black.\"[14]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 13: _Isis_ is supposed to be the same as _Io_, and the\r\n     island of Tiran is evidently, as I have already stated in a\r\n     preceding note, that which Procopius names Iôtabê, _Iotabe_. This\r\n     word is probably derived from Ious ta abata,--the _shrine_, or\r\n     sacred place, of _Io_.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 14: Travels in Arabia, vol. ii., p. 97.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr Lepsius remarks on this mountain, that--\r\n\r\n  \"Although it is certainly a high mountain, still it is a\r\n  _secondary_ one, and almost eclipsed by others of the Great\r\n  Southern Chain, the geographical centre of which is neither in\r\n  _Gebel Mousa_, nor the loftier _Gebel Katherin_, but in the more\r\n  southern, and considerably more elevated _Gebel-um-Schomar_.\"\r\n\r\n_Gebel Katherin_, composed principally of a coarse _red granite_,\r\npresents the same _conical peaks_. But in Wadi _Owasz_, S. by W., from\r\nthe last mountain, Burckhardt noticed \"a small chain of _white_ and\r\n_red sandstone_ hills in the midst of _granite_.\"\r\n\r\n_Gebel-um-Schomar_ (\"Mount Mother _Schomar_\"), also consists chiefly\r\nof _granite_; the lower part _red_, but the top is almost _white_. In\r\nits middle, between the granite, occur broad layers of brittle _black\r\nslate_, mixed with veins of _quartz_ and _felspar_, and with\r\n_micaceous schist_. Its extreme _peak_, about 8800 feet above the sea,\r\nis sharp pointed, and seems to be inaccessible, owing to its\r\nperpendicular and smooth sides. Burckhardt, in his attempt to ascend\r\nit, was obliged to halt at about 200 feet below it. This was, until\r\nrecently, esteemed the _highest_ point in the Peninsula; but,\r\naccording to Herr Russegger, two or three other peaks, to the south of\r\nit, are about 500 feet more lofty; the _extreme_ elevation of this\r\nlast group, which seems not to bear any distinct appellation, he\r\nestimates at 9300 English feet.\r\n\r\nI here add, after the latter author, a sketch of the _granite peaks_\r\nof the high Modern-Sinaic mountains, from north to south, as they\r\npresent so interesting and remarkable an appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sketch of granite peaks]\r\n\r\nIn the narrow valley, a little south of _Gebel Mohala_, which is all\r\ngranite, on the east side of, or opposite to, the Schomar, is a spring\r\nnamed _Tabakat_, where beautiful porphyry is observed.\r\n\r\nThe south side of Mount _Schomar_ is very abrupt, and there is _no_\r\nsecondary chain between it and the other lofty southern mountains, and\r\nthe long gravelly plain _El Kaa_.\r\n\r\nFrom that plain, entering _Wadi Hebron_--a ravine about 100 yards\r\nwide--fragments of rocks, principally of _granite_ and _porphyry_\r\nwashed down by torrents, are frequent; a small stream is seen flowing\r\namong them; in spots, some date trees occur, and likewise the\r\nmanna-producing tamarisk. Continuing to ascend, a moderately-steep\r\npass is reached; afterwards, a descent of about 700 feet leads into\r\nthe sandy _Wadi Solaf_ \"wine valley;\" and then, gaining, with some\r\ndifficulty, the summit of a steeper pass, the north-west angle of the\r\nextensive _Wadi Raha_ is come to. Here, again, the present Sinaic\r\ngroup, beyond the plain, exhibits its rugged mountains of dark\r\n_granite_, with \"stern, naked, splintered _peaks_, and ridges of\r\nindescribable grandeur.\"\r\n\r\nNext, turning to the north down the narrow declivity called _Nakb\r\nHawi_, the \"windy pass,\" of which the stupendous _granite_ walls or\r\ncliffs elevate themselves to about 800 feet, passing to the west end\r\nof _Wadi Solaf_, where it meets _Wadi Firan_ and _Wadi-el-Sheikh_, and\r\nfollowing the last valley as far as _El Szaleib_, that ascent is\r\nattained. There the formation consists of _granite_, on the upper beds\r\nof which run layers of _red felspar_. North-east of _Wadi-el-Ush_ is\r\nsituate _Gebel Sheyger_, which affords some native _cinnabar_. The\r\nthree principal passes leading from the sandy Debbet-el-Ramleh on to\r\nthe great desert over the Tyh range, are, _El Mureikhi_ near the\r\ncentre and near _Gebel-el-Egmeh_; then _El Warsah_, said to be of too\r\nrapid an ascent for caravans; and the third, which is most to the\r\nwest, _El Rakineh_ (the painted.) Afterwards, at some distance to the\r\nNW., is the valley opening past _Ras Wadi Gharandel_, that has already\r\nbeen described.\r\n\r\nProceeding, again, across the plain El Ramleh, and over the pass\r\nMureikhi on to the Desert-el-Tyh, in the approach to the castle of\r\n_Nakhl_, on the east, a few miles off, low _chalky_ hills appeared;\r\nand in places there were holes wherein _rock-salt_ had been dug. The\r\nwater at Nakhl is brackish, and the ground chalky, covered with loose\r\npebbles. _Wadi Nesil_ was observed to be overgrown with green shrubs.\r\n_Gebel-el-Thughar_, signifying \"the mouths,\" presents a mountainous\r\ntract, in which followed a valley with _calcareous_ hills: here deep\r\nsands were lodged, and large insulated rocks of a porous _tufa_,\r\ncalled by Burckhardt _tufwacke_, lie scattered in many places.\r\n\r\n  \"The termination of the vast gravelly plain we had been crossing\r\n  from _Nakhl_ was now at hand; but we could yet see it spreading\r\n  out wide to our left, the mirage giving its distant portions the\r\n  appearance of a succession of blue lakes; directly in front were\r\n  the mountains which close it in; and far to the right we could\r\n  see, stretching away, a still higher range running to the north,\r\n  and on the left the tops of the mountains about Wadi Gharandel,\r\n  the _Taset_ (cup) _Soddur_ being conspicuous afar. We entered\r\n  these mountains by a slight ascent, which struck soon after the\r\n  head of a long winding valley descending towards Suez: the immense\r\n  plain we had traversed, floated away in mist, and we had now done\r\n  with the plateau of the Great Desert.\"[15]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 15: _Bartlett's_ \"Forty Days in the Desert,\" p. 167.\r\n\r\nThence a plain, which is below the level of the Desert-el-Tyh, and\r\ncovered with moving _sands_, extends as far as the sea-shore. These\r\n_sands_ are collected by the winds, in many spots, into hills 30 or 40\r\nfeet high. The wells at _Mabuk_ afford good water by digging to the\r\ndepth of 10 or 12 feet.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly_, Once more leaving Suez; after having passed over a small\r\npiece of marine and alluvial formation near the sea, and taking a\r\nwesterly direction, a narrow tract of _tertiary sandstone_, so\r\ndesignated by Russegger, is observed; it is a plain which gradually\r\nascends from the shore of the Gulf, and in it is placed the Castle of\r\n_Ajroud_; the water obtained there is very bitter. Beyond this to the\r\nwest, the plain becomes _sandy_, and covered with black flints.\r\n\r\nBut the soil and hills at _Wadi Emshash_, which signify the \"Valley of\r\nthe Waterpits,\" near Ajroud, are calcareous: the well there, called\r\n_Bir Emshash_, yields after rain good drinking water. The hills around\r\nAjroud consist of _tertiary limestone_ and _marl_. More to the south,\r\nGebel Ataka divides this formation, itself being a _secondary\r\nlimestone_ belonging to the _cretaceous_ series, and, according to Dr\r\nRobinson, is strewed thickly with _flint_ pebbles. It terminates in\r\n_Ras Ataka_, or \"Cape Deliverance,\" on the Gulf. The sandy and\r\ngravelly plain, _El Baidea_, the _Wadi Tawarik_ of others, has been\r\nnamed by some, the \"Valley of Moses,\" Wadi Mousa; it communicates on\r\nthe west with _Wadi-el-Tyh_.\r\n\r\n_Gebel Deraj_ (steps) is limestone of the same cretaceous series as\r\nMount Ataka; and this formation stretches out southwards to a great\r\ndistance, constituting a large portion of the East Egyptian Desert.\r\n\r\nThen on the south of the former mountain, a band of granite, which\r\nforms the northern ridge of _Gebel Kallala_, is observed, wherein\r\nthere exist remains of old _copper_ mines. Those called\r\n_Reigatamerih_, situate among low hills, \"have evidently been worked\r\nby the ancients, as well from the quantity of pottery and _scoriæ_\r\nthere, as from the remains of miners' houses, and the regular manner\r\nin which the caverns have been cut, following up the veins.\"[16]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 16: _Mr J. Wilkinson_ on the Eastern Desert of Upper\r\n     Egypt, p. 32, vol. ii. Journal of the Royal Geographical Society.\r\n\r\nNear, on the SE., there is a well (_bir_) named _Horreh_, whose water\r\nis bad, owing to the _sulphur_ which it contains. This is placed in\r\n_Wadi Araba_, an extensive valley, running in a direction nearly due\r\nW. and E., and descending from _Wadi Chaderat_ very rapidly to the\r\nshore of the gulf, which is here termed by the Arabs _Mersa Zafraneh_,\r\n_i.e._, \"Harbour of Saffron.\" The coast itself is flat and marshy. The\r\nheadlands on the south are a conglomerate, or _breccia_ rock, of the\r\n_Tertiary_ formation, composed of shells, stones, and other\r\nsubstances, held together by a calcareous cement. The Arabs report,\r\nthat a carriage-road anciently existed through the Wadi Araba, and led\r\nto the Bay of Zafraneh. This, I conceive, might have been the road of\r\ncommunication to the Egyptian colonies and copper mines on the\r\nopposite Sinaic peninsula, in _Wadi Maghara_, _Sarbut-el-Chadem_, &c.,\r\nand over which the produce of those mines, having been shipped from\r\nthe harbour of Zelime to the Mersa Zafraneh, might have been conveyed\r\nin waggons to the Nile. But, whether or not the _Araba_ mountains that\r\nrise a little to the south of the opposite coast of the Peninsula had\r\nreceived the _same_ appellation from _this valley_, there seems to be\r\nno testimony to decide. The \"Monastery of St Antony\"--_Deir\r\nAntonios_--distant about 17 miles from the sea, is a fortified convent\r\nof Copts, surrounded by a strong wall, of about 35 feet in height, the\r\nentrance to which is by a trap-door, wherefrom a rope descends, as in\r\nthe present Sinaic convent. The keep, or place of safety, is an\r\ninsulated tower, defended by a drawbridge. According to common\r\nstatement, this was the abode and place of burial of _St Antony_, the\r\nfounder of Monachism. The mountains to the south, at the northern end\r\nof which stands the convent, are _calcareous_ (of the same\r\n_cretaceous_ formation), containing in places a great deal of _salt_.\r\nThey are known to the Arabs by the term of _Gebel Kallala_, and, in\r\nfact, constitute the southern ridge of that chain. Another large and\r\nsimilarly protected convent, called _Deir Bolos_ (Paul), distant from\r\nthe former[17] about 15 miles in a direct SE. line, is situate in a\r\npicturesque place, and about 10 miles from the nearest point of the\r\nGulf of Suez. An adjoining garden abounds in date and other\r\nfruit-trees. On the east, between this convent and the sea, _Wadi\r\nGirfeh_ is approached, among low hills: on the tops of some of these\r\nthe substructions of houses are visible, having been built with\r\nuncemented stones. Also some chambers, or catacombs, are cut in the\r\nrock: in the larger were found crystals of _rock-salt_; the strata are\r\ncomposed of _limestone_, and contain many fossils. Broken pieces of\r\n_terra cotta_ vases, chiefly red, are everywhere observed; and they,\r\nwith other vestiges, probably point out the site of a Roman colonial\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 17: See the Views of the Convents of St Paul and St\r\n     Anthony, plate 51, p. 128, chap. vi., book ii., vol. i., in\r\n     _Pococke's_ \"Description of the East.\"\r\n\r\nProceeding from St Paul's to the SE., for near 15 miles, the line of\r\nthe _primitive_ mountains is reached on the left, whilst the\r\n_secondary_ chain of Gebel Kallala, consisting of limestone with\r\nammonites, is continued on the right, or west. South of Wadi Dthahal\r\n_micaceous schist_ approaching to _gneiss_ occurs, and a little\r\nfurther, the primitive and _sandstone_, or _gritstone_ rocks join.\r\nThence the secondary, or _cretaceous_ mountains, diverging to the\r\nsouth and south-west, gradually decrease in altitude.\r\n\r\nAgain, southwards, some more ancient copper-works are noticed; and\r\nthen, _Gebel Horvashia_, whose formation is _granite_, rises a few\r\nmiles off to the SE.; in its natural basin much good water is retained\r\nafter rain. _Wadi Abu Hadth_ next attracts attention from its\r\npossessing a good deal of fine herbage, and many gum-arabic trees. Of\r\nthe granite mountains in this region, _Gebel Agrib_, or _Garib_, or\r\n_Gharib_ (\"camel's hump\") is the loftiest, as it elevates itself to\r\nabout 6000 feet above the sea level; and from its position it forms a\r\nconspicuous landmark far out at sea.\r\n\r\nThe ascent of this majestic mountain, from its steepness and numerous\r\nravines, is found to be fatiguing. Mr J. Wilkinson[18] describes it as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  \"The first evening we reached the base of the highest cone, where we\r\n  slept, and ascended the next morning to the summit, from which we\r\n  had a view of the mountains on either side of the sea, and the\r\n  different plains. We tracked the gazelles very nearly to the summit,\r\n  and every now and then in the ravines found some solitary plants\r\n  growing under the shade of a projecting stone. The peaks of this\r\n  mountain resemble the _Aiguilles_ near Mount Blanc; but, to equal\r\n  that mountain in beauty, it requires the lower parts to be covered\r\n  with the woods and verdure of the Alps, and the desert plain below\r\n  to be exchanged for the green meadows of Switzerland. I calculate\r\n  the height to be 5513 feet above the ravine in the plain below,\r\n  which is a few hundred feet above the level of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n     Footnote 18: Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. ii.\r\n     p. 39.\r\n\r\nAbout ten miles southward, _Bir-el-Dara_--the \"Well of Dara,\" below\r\nthe mountain of that name, occurs; there, likewise, copper _scoriæ_,\r\nsmelting furnaces, and miners' houses, are observed.\r\n\r\nFurther south, more _copper mines_ are seen in a bare place, among low\r\nhills, all of which have been examined for the ore.\r\n\r\nAdvancing south-eastwards by the plain, some _calcareous_ rocks are\r\npassed, and afterwards a line of _sandstone_,[19] with limestone over\r\nit, running parallel to, and nearly equidistant between the _two\r\nprimitive_ ridges. _Wadi-el-Enned_ succeeds to the eastward, where a\r\nbeautifully clear rivulet is found; but its water is too bad for the\r\nuse of animals, being chiefly serviceable for the nourishment of\r\nnumerous date palms. This spot lies at the foot of some _limestone_\r\nhills of the _cretaceous_ series that join the eastern _granitic_\r\nridge.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 19: Mr J. Wilkinson (_ibid_, Note, p. 41), says,\r\n     \"Judging from the angle of its dip, it formerly rose _over_ the\r\n     lower, or eastern primitive range, from which, however, it is now\r\n     separated by a valley, or bed of a torrent.\"\r\n\r\nNext, on the south, comes _Gebel Kuffra_, where the water is so _salt_\r\nas only to be drunk by camels. _Gebel Dochan_, (smoke)--the \"Mons\r\nPorphyrites\" of the ancients--rising about eleven miles more\r\nsouthward, and in the same line with the supposed site of _Myos\r\nHormus_, Myos Hormos, the \"mouse harbour,\" is too distant from our\r\nproposed limits, to receive a full description in the present Memoir.\r\nI will only remark that at Mount _Dochan_, there exist some\r\ninteresting ruins, and \"those vast _quarries_, from which Rome took so\r\nmany superb pieces of _porphyry_, to adorn her baths and\r\nporticoes.\"[20] On its southern side, Mr J. Wilkinson adds, \"we met\r\nwith some _Breccia Verde_; and of other kinds of _Breccia_ we had\r\nobserved great quantities and varieties at Dochan.\" The sea-shore,\r\nabout Myos Hormus, is bare and deserted; to the west, at some distance\r\nfrom the harbour, the _granitic_ chain extends; on the east, between\r\nit and the sea, a low ridge of _limestone_ hills, which unites with\r\nthe primitive rocks on the north, comes down towards the shore. \"And,\r\nin the distance, on the north, is seen the mountain _El Zeit_, so\r\ncalled from the quantity of _petroleum_ found there; whence project\r\ntwo small headlands, forming two gulfs, at the entrance of which are\r\nmany long _sandbanks_. May not this be the '_mons Eos_' of Pliny?\"[21]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 20: _Ibid_, p. 42.--Pliny writes of the _quarries_,\r\n     \"quantis libet molibus cædendis sufficiunt _Lapidicinæ_.\" Lib.\r\n     36, cap. 7. They produced _red porphyry_ of a most beautiful,\r\n     close-grained kind; so Pliny says, \"_rubet porphyrites_ in eadem\r\n     OEgypto.\"\r\n\r\n     Footnote 21: Ibid., p. 51.\r\n\r\nThis _Gebel Zeit_, or \"Mount of Oil,\" runs out into a promontory on\r\none side of the Strait of Jubal; at its foot a copious supply of\r\n_Petroleum_, or rock oil, is obtained. It is about as liquid as\r\nturpentine, of a black or dark-brown colour, and is collected by the\r\nGreek Christians of Tur, who take it there and sell it, for rheumatism\r\nand for healing sores. The Arabs call it _Zeit-el-Gebel_--\"oil of the\r\nmountain.\"\r\n\r\nSouth of this promontory the sea is studded with a number of small\r\nislands, some of which are described by Strabo; all, however, I\r\nbelieve, except _Shadwan_, which is of secondary limestone, are of\r\nrecent marine formation--chiefly of _Coral_.\r\n\r\n                (_Conclusion in our next Number._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Climate of Whitehaven_\r\n\r\n  _Synopsis of Meteorological Observations made at the Observatory,\r\n                Whitehaven, Cumberland, in the Year 1849._\r\n      BY JOHN FLETCHER MILLER, Esq., F.

and I think every meteorologist must\r\n     feel himself greatly indebted to Mr Glaisher for this valuable\r\n     compilation, which is also based on observations made under his\r\n     own superintendence at the National Observatory.\r\n\r\n     In eight months of the year 1847, the difference between the\r\n     observed and the deduced Dew-point at Whitehaven, is 0°·10; and\r\n     in 1848, it is only 0°·07, the mean of the two periods comprising\r\n     1220 observations, amounting to the comparatively evanescent\r\n     fraction of 8/100ths of a degree. Such satisfactory proofs of the\r\n     perfection of Mr G.'s tables have induced me to abandon Daniell's\r\n     Dew-point Apparatus, for that more simple, less costly, and\r\n     equally correct form of Hygrometer, the combination of the dry\r\n     and wet bulb thermometers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL RADIATION.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note:  Key to abbreviations in

was on Cork throughout the\r\n     year. It is here reduced to the Standard of Raw Wool.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 27: In 1846, the Thermometer was placed on Cork in\r\n     cloudy and wet weather.  The results are reduced to the Standard\r\n     of Raw Wool, by adding 0°·25 to the _recorded_ annual mean.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 28: Difference between the mean maximum in the Sun's\r\n     rays, and the mean maximum in the shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Form, &c. of Instruments._\r\n\r\nThe Barometer (the frame of which is brass) is a standard made by\r\nBarrow, under the direction of James Glaisher, Esq., of the Greenwich\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment for the difference of capacity of tube and cistern is\r\neffected previous to every observation, and the correction for\r\ncapillarity and reduction to the temperature of 32° is made at the\r\nclose of each month.\r\n\r\nThe difference between its readings and those of the Greenwich\r\nstandard is scarcely appreciable, being only 0·002 inch.\r\n\r\nThe Dry and Wet Bulb Thermometers, also made by Barrow, are considered\r\nto have identical readings under similar circumstances, and both, too,\r\nagree with the Greenwich standard thermometer. The Dew-point\r\napparatus, now discontinued, approximates very closely in its readings\r\nto the dry and wet bulb thermometers.\r\n\r\nThe Self-registering Thermometer is a large Six made by Dollond in\r\n1840, and its average difference from the standard is within 2/10ths\r\nof a degree. A duplicate and precisely similar thermometer (which has\r\nalso been repeatedly compared with a standard at every part of the\r\nscale) is fixed by its side, so that in case of No. 1 getting out of\r\norder, No. 2 can be resorted to without detriment to the results.\r\n\r\nThese instruments all have a northern aspect, and are placed about 4\r\nfeet above the ground. The naked thermometers employed for indicating\r\nthe relative amount of solar and terrestrial radiation, are precisely\r\nsimilar to those in use at the Government Observatories.\r\n\r\nThe Rain and Evaporation Gauges are 8 inches in diameter, and the\r\nmetres are graduated to the 1/1000th part of an inch. Both are read\r\noff daily. The aperture of the rain-gauge is about 7 feet above the\r\nground. The evaporation dish is mounted on a moveable stand, 4 feet 4\r\ninches in height, and the circular shelf on which the vessel rests, is\r\njust large enough to hold it. The gauge receives a fair proportion of\r\nwind and sunshine, and is always exposed in the open air during the\r\nday, except when _rain is falling_. At night and in wet weather, it is\r\nplaced under a capacious shed, 9 feet in height, and open in front.\r\nThus, it is conceived that the evaporating surface is freely acted\r\nupon by all the circumstances concerned in promoting this important\r\nnatural process.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the wind is taken twice daily, and its force is\r\nregistered on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 6; the highest number is\r\nreserved for storms approaching the hurricane in violence, and is very\r\nrarely recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Remarks on the Weather in 1849._\r\n\r\n_January._--A damp wet month, except the first week, when sharp frost\r\nprevailed. The mean temperature is 0°·68 _above_ the average. On the\r\nnight between the 2d and 3d, a naked thermometer on the grass fell to\r\n4°, and one on raw wool to 2°·8 below zero, being the lowest\r\ntemperature I have recorded. The radiation indicated by raw wool was\r\n21°·5. Between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 10th, a\r\nterrific thunder-storm burst suddenly over the town, and spread great\r\nalarm amongst the slumbering inhabitants. Seven or eight dazzling\r\ndischarges of the electric fluid, followed by deafening crashes,\r\nsucceeded each other in about as many minutes. The storm was almost\r\nvertical; and between several of the flashes and the accompanying\r\nthunder, there was scarcely an appreciable interval, certainly not\r\nmore than a single second of time. The war of the elements ceased as\r\nsuddenly as it commenced, and altogether, the storm did not last more\r\nthan ten minutes. The wind, which previously blew a heavy gale, lulled\r\nalmost to a calm as the last peal died away. The storm was followed by\r\na heavy fall of rain and hail. It appears to have been pretty much\r\nconfined to this town and neighbourhood. Thunder was also heard on the\r\nevening of the 14th, and lightning was seen on the nights of the 21st,\r\n26th, and 29th. Saturn's ring was perceived at this Observatory on the\r\nnight of the 31st, after a long continuance of damp, wet weather. As\r\nthis singular appendage was readily seen, and was well and sharply\r\ndefined, I have no doubt the instrument would have shewn it ten or\r\nfourteen days earlier, had the nights been at all favourable. The ring\r\nwas also seen on the night of the 11th of September 1848, during its\r\ntemporary reappearance.\r\n\r\n_February._--A fine, dry, and mild month. The temperature 3°·49\r\n_above_ the average of twelve years. On the 11th, the barometer\r\nattained the remarkably high point of 30·82 at this Observatory, which\r\nis about 90 feet above the sea level. At the Royal Observatory,\r\nGreenwich (40 feet above sea), the maximum was 30·85, being greater\r\nthan any reading since January 1825, when the barometer at the Royal\r\nSociety's apartments attained to 30·841, at 81 feet above the sea\r\nlevel; and there is no other instance recorded in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions of a reading so high as 30·8, from the commencement of\r\nthe series in 1774. The maxima of pressure recorded on the 11th in\r\nvarious parts of the country, were all found to give a reading of\r\n30·90 at the mean sea level.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, primroses were in flower on the cliffs between Panton and\r\nHarrington.\r\n\r\n_March._--Similar to February. Temperature 2°·29 _above_ the average,\r\nand the complement of the dew-point 2°·40 _below_ the mean of the two\r\npreceding years.\r\n\r\nFIRST QUARTER.--The temperature of the first quarter of 1849 is 2°·16\r\n_above_ the average of twelve years, and the complement of the\r\ndew-point is 1°·52 _below_ that of the corresponding quarter in the\r\nunhealthy years 1847 and 1848.\r\n\r\nThe average fall of rain is 11·593 inches; in 1849, we have had 8·565,\r\nor 3·02 inches _below_ the usual quantity.\r\n\r\nThe deaths in the quarter ending March 31, in the town and suburb of\r\nPreston Quarter, are 168, being 16 _above_ the corrected quarterly\r\naverage, which is 152. In the corresponding quarters of 1848 and 1849,\r\nthe deaths were 250 and 187 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe deaths exceed the births by 25 in number.\r\n\r\n_April._--A fine, dry, but cold month. The temperature 1°·95 below the\r\naverage. On the 23d the cuckoo was heard, and on the following day the\r\nswallow was seen in this neighbourhood. On Good Friday, the 6th, two\r\nparhelia, accompanied by a halo, were seen by a friend who was fishing\r\nby the river Calder. The sky was covered with a thin cirro-stratus, so\r\nthat the images did not present any defined outline or disc, but\r\nconsisted of three circular patches of light of nearly equal\r\nintensity, so much so, that it was difficult to distinguish the real\r\nfrom the phantom suns. The phenomena were first noticed about 5 P.M.,\r\nand they remained visible till near six. The ring or halo passed\r\nthrough the centres of the parhelia, one of which was to the left, and\r\nthe other to the right of the sun, with which they formed a straight\r\nline.\r\n\r\n_May._--A fine month, with an average mean temperature. The sun shone\r\nout on 29 days. The depth of rain is about an inch _above_ the average\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n_June._--A very dry month, and by far the coldest June I have recorded\r\nin the last seventeen years. The mean temperature is no less than\r\n3°·67 below the average. The hay harvest began in this neighbourhood\r\nabout the 20th.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer on the grass, on raw wool, was below the freezing\r\npoint on eight nights; on the nights of the 8th and 10th it fell to\r\n27°·5, and on that of the 19th and 20th, to 25°. On several mornings\r\nice was seen in the immediate vicinity of the town, and on the 3d of\r\nthe month there was a somewhat heavy fall of snow amongst the\r\nmountains. Highbell, Kentmere, High Street, and the mountains around\r\nMardale, were covered with the mantle of winter to the depth of 6\r\ninches. Such an incident has not occurred, it is said, since 1827,\r\nwhen several sheep were lost and smothered in snow-drifts on Mosedale\r\nand Helvellyn; and Skiddaw was covered with snow. Both snow and hail\r\nare recorded on the 10th in the register kept for me at Bassenthwaite\r\nHalls, at the foot of Skiddaw.\r\n\r\nWhat is most remarkable, this unusual coldness does not appear to have\r\nbeen experienced at all in the southern counties of England. At\r\nGreenwich, the temperature is stated to be of the same value as that\r\nof the average from 70 years, but less than that of the preceding\r\neight years, by 1°·9. According to Mr Glaisher's tables, published in\r\nthe Registrar-General's Report for the June quarter, the mean\r\ntemperature in Cornwall and Devonshire _exceeds_ that of the\r\ncorresponding month in 1847, by 0°·7, and south of lat. 52°, it is in\r\nexcess 9/10ths of a degree. Between the parallels 52° and 53°, the\r\ntemperature is 1°·2 _below_ that of June 1847; between 53° and 54°, it\r\nis 2°·1, and at Whitehaven, in lat. 54½°, it is 2°·7 below that of\r\nJune 1847.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary depression in the temperature has therefore been\r\nunparticipated in, by places situated south of the parallel of 53°.\r\n\r\nSECOND QUARTER.--The mean temperature of the quarter ending June 30,\r\nis 1°·92 _below_ the average of twelve preceding years; and the\r\ndifference between the air and dew-point temperatures is 1°·32 _above_\r\nthat of the corresponding quarter in the years 1847 and 1848.\r\n\r\nThe average fall of rain is 8·15 inches; in the second quarter of\r\n1849, the fall is 5·74 inches, or 2·40 inches under the normal\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nThe deaths in the town and suburb are 139, being 21 above the\r\ncorrected average number, which is 117. In the June quarters of 1847\r\nand 1848 the deaths were 177 and 147 respectively. The births exceed\r\nthe deaths by 59.\r\n\r\n_July._--Cold and wet. Temperature 1°·82 _below_ the average. The hay\r\nharvest began in this neighbourhood about the 20th June; meadow hay\r\nwas rather light on the ground, but the crop generally was well\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n_August._--Average temperature and depth of rain, with a serene and\r\nstagnant atmosphere. The complement of the dew point is 1°·78 _below_\r\nthe average of the month in the two preceding years.\r\n\r\n_September._--A fine, mild, and rather dry month, with serene\r\natmosphere. At the close of the month, several of the public fountains\r\nwere dry, and most of the pumps in the town had ceased to yield their\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nTHIRD QUARTER.--The temperature of the quarter ending September 30th\r\nis 0°·37 _below_ the average, and the complement of the dew-point, as\r\ncompared with the two previous years, is 0°·5 _below_ the mean. The\r\ndepth of rain is 0·36 inch under the average quantity, which is 12·42\r\ninches. The deaths in the third quarter of 1849, in the town and\r\nsuburb, are 168, or 47 above the corrected average number; and, except\r\nin 1846, a greater number than has occurred in any September quarter\r\nsince the register was begun in 1839. In the September quarter of the\r\nlast four years, the deaths are as under: 1846, 255; 1847, 148; 1848,\r\n142; and 1849, 168. The births exceed the deaths by six in number.\r\nDuring this quarter we had a few cases of Asiatic cholera in this\r\ntown, chiefly in the month of September; and at the adjacent seaport\r\nof Workington the disease was of a most malignant character, and\r\nexceedingly fatal. The total number of deaths from the commencement of\r\nthe epidemic on the 13th of August, till it entirely ceased on the 6th\r\nof November, was 172. In 1841, the population was 6041, which gives a\r\nmortality of 2·8 per cent., or one death in every 35 persons, from\r\ncholera. It is, however, believed that the population of Workington\r\nhas decreased since the last census was taken; and at the time the\r\nepidemic was raging, most of the respectable inhabitants had left the\r\nplace; so that the ratio of mortality amongst the then residents must\r\nhave been considerably greater than is here stated. A singular fact\r\nconnected with the disease is its sudden cessation for several days,\r\nat the expiration of which it returns with increased virulence. In the\r\nweek between the 25th and 31st of August, the deaths were 65; from the\r\n31st August to the 8th September there were none; on the 8th, 12; 9th\r\nand 10th, none; on the 11th, 13; and on the 12th only one death; 13th,\r\n11; from the 14th to the 19th inclusive, the deaths averaged 2·5\r\ndaily, but on the 20th they rose to 13; and between the 21st and the\r\nend of September there were only eight deaths, which occurred on the\r\n21st, 22d, 25th, and 27th.\r\n\r\nBetween the 1st and 20th of October the deaths were 32, and during\r\nthat period there were frequently none for three or four consecutive\r\ndays. There was only one death after the 20th October. It occurred on\r\nthe 6th of November, when the pestilence ceased. I am informed by a\r\nresident medical gentleman, that at the commencement of the disease\r\nthe cases were rapidly fatal, many of them after eight or ten hours'\r\nillness, and it was then almost entirely confined to the lower\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe proximate cause of the exceedingly fatal character of the disease\r\nat this seaport is probably to be found in the effluvia engendered by\r\nthe extensive tract of marshy land, called the \"Cloffocks,\" adjoining\r\nthe river Derwent, and in the immediate vicinity of the town. What is\r\nmost remarkable, the first case of cholera at Workington occurred on\r\nthe same day of the same month, in the same house, and even in the\r\nsame room in the said house, where the epidemic first broke out in the\r\nsummer of 1832. There is no peculiarity in the situation of the house,\r\nnor can any reason be assigned for this most singular coincidence. I\r\nam informed that very few insects were seen about the river, and,\r\nduring the height of the disease, the rooks entirely forsook their\r\nold-established quarters in the grounds adjoining the Hall.[29]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 29: The cause of this fearful epidemic is still a\r\n     mystery. The meteorological conditions of the atmosphere,\r\n     although slightly abnormal, are wholly inadequate to account for\r\n     its induction. It is most probably induced by some gaseous poison\r\n     diffused through the atmosphere, but of a nature so subtle that\r\n     the most delicate analysis fails to detect its presence.\r\n     According to the experiments of Dr Dundas Thompson of Glasgow, no\r\n     solid matter existed in the air, but ammonia was obtained from it\r\n     in the proportion of 0·319 grain of caustic ammonia, or 0·731\r\n     grain of carbonate of ammonia, to 1000 pounds of air.\r\n\r\n_October._--Cold, with an average fall of rain (5¼ inches.) The mean\r\ntemperature is 2°·5 _below_ the average. The grain crops were above an\r\naverage in point of quantity, and they were got under cover in\r\nexcellent condition. Garden fruit, as pears, apples, &c., were not so\r\nplentiful as usual. On the evening of the 28th, that rare phenomenon a\r\nlunar rainbow, was seen from the grounds at Tarn Bank, near\r\nCockermouth, by Isaac Fletcher, Esq., to whom I am indebted for the\r\nfollowing description of it:--\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the evening the sky was clear, but at 8h 30m a\r\ndense mist rose from the river Derwent and entirely overspread a large\r\nsegment of the northern horizon; whilst to the south, the atmosphere\r\ncontinued comparatively clear, the moon, within four days of full,\r\nshining brightly near the meridian. About 9h 10m, there was a faint\r\nluminous arch in the north, which was evidently a lunar rainbow, or\r\nrather a fog-bow, for no rain whatever was visible at the time. The\r\nlight reflected by the arch was white, and perfectly free from\r\nprismatic colour. Its breadth was considerable, perhaps 4° or 5°, and\r\nits centre or highest part, passed close under the star beta Ursæ\r\nMajoris, so that the extreme altitude of the arch was probably about\r\n18° or 20°. The edges were not sharply defined, but gradually shaded\r\noff. It was noticed that the denser the fog became, the more apparent\r\nwas the arch, and _vice versa_, so that the phenomenon could not have\r\nbeen of an auroral character. The phenomenon was watched for ten or\r\nfifteen minutes, when the gradual dispersion of the fog, by destroying\r\nthe refracting medium, put an end to this interesting appearance.\r\n\r\n_November._--As usual, a very dull, damp month, with but little\r\ndifference between the temperature of the days and nights. Temperature\r\n1°·20 _above_ the average.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 2d, a swallow was seen on the wing in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of this town. The maximum temperature of the day\r\nwas 55°. Between the 9th and 12th inclusive, the extremes of day and\r\nnight temperature only varied 2 degrees.\r\n\r\n_December._--A fine dry month with occasional frosty nights.\r\nTemperature 2°·15, and rain 2·19 inches _below_ the average. Two loud\r\npeals of thunder and much lightning on the night of the 14th.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable meteor observed at Edinburgh on the evening of the\r\n19th, and minutely described by Professor Forbes who witnessed it, was\r\nalso seen at Whitehaven under the same circumstances and at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLAST QUARTER.--The mean temperature of the last quarter of 1849 is\r\n1°·15 _below_ the average, and the complement of the dew-point is\r\n0°·87 _below_ the mean of the two preceding years. The average depth\r\nof rain for the quarter is 14·64 inches; in 1849 the quarterly fall is\r\n12·62 inches, or 2·02 inches _under_ the normal quantity. The deaths\r\nin this quarter, in the town and suburbs, are 131, being 4 _below_ the\r\naverage number.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to have to announce a favourable change in the sanitary\r\ncondition of this town, and to record the termination of an excessive\r\nmortality, which uninterruptedly prevailed for a period of two years\r\nand a half; for this is the only quarterly period wherein the deaths\r\nhave not exceeded the average since March 1846.\r\n\r\nIn the corresponding quarters of 1846, 1847, and 1848, the deaths were\r\n215, 161, and 176 respectively. The births exceed the deaths by 34.\r\n\r\nTHE AURORA BOREALIS.--There have been seven exhibitions of the aurora\r\nborealis during the year 1849, two of which were sufficiently\r\nremarkable to merit something more than a passing notice.\r\n\r\nThe first occurred on the evening of January 14th. At 10 P.M., a\r\nwell-defined auroral arch, about 5° in width, extended from NNE. to\r\nW., its highest part reaching nearly to Arided in Cygnus. At 11h there\r\nwas one complete arch, and segments of two other arches, all\r\nbrilliant, crossing each other in the NW., and throwing off intensely\r\nbright streamers, some of which reached the altitude of the Pointers.\r\nThe aurora was now exceedingly beautiful, and emitted considerable\r\nlight. The streamers appeared to have a duplex lateral motion, running\r\nalong the upper edge of the arch from west to north, and then\r\nbackwards from north to west. The clear sky beneath the arches was\r\nalmost black, from contrast. At 11h 30m the arches had broken up, and\r\nthe streamers appeared to emanate from the horizon.\r\n\r\n_February 18._--At 9 P.M. there was a brilliant band of auroral light\r\nin the east about 6° in width, which shot upwards towards the zenith,\r\nthrowing off short lateral streamers. At times, a complete arch of\r\nvarying width extended from the eastern to the western horizon; at\r\nothers, it was broken up into two or more detached portions. At 9h\r\n45m, a magnificent rainbow-like arch about 2° in width, spanned the\r\nheavens from ENE. to WSW. The altitude of the centre was apparently\r\nabout 75°; the lower edge, at or near the highest point of the arch,\r\nwas bounded by the star Castor. The arch was beautifully defined, and\r\nof perfectly even width throughout its entire extent; it disappeared\r\nin a few minutes after my attention was called to it, and soon after\r\nthe sky became overcast. But for the absence of the moon, it might\r\neasily have been mistaken for a lunar rainbow. A precisely similar\r\narch made its appearance here on the evening of the 21st of March\r\n1833, and as far as my observation goes, these perfect rainbow-like\r\narches are of exceedingly rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe following phenomenon though unconnected with auroræ, is probably\r\nof electric origin; and, as an unusual atmospheric appearance, is\r\nworthy of being placed on record:--_September 16._--The sky was mostly\r\novercast throughout the day, except a segment extending from WSW. to\r\nENE., which was bright and clear to an altitude of about 15°. The\r\nupper boundary of the clear blue space was an elliptical segment\r\nformed by a sheet of white cloud, which was partially illuminated\r\ntowards the western extremity, and somewhat resembled an auroral arch.\r\nI first noticed this blue arch about 3 P.M., and from that time until\r\nit disappeared, about six o'clock, there was not the slightest\r\napparent change, either in its altitude or position. It was observed\r\nas early as 7 o'clock in the morning, when it was, nearer to the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS.--The year 1849 is the driest we have had since 1844;\r\nthe fall of rain (39 inches) is 7·9 inches under the average annual\r\ndepth, which is 47 inches nearly. From some cause, the annual quantity\r\nof rain at this place is evidently on the decrease, and the diminution\r\nis, I believe, general all over the north of England. Probably the\r\nlarge amount of moor and waste marshy land brought into cultivation of\r\nlate years, and the more efficient drainage of the country generally,\r\nby diminishing the evaporating surface, and so interfering with that\r\ninvisible process of nature which is the source of every kind of\r\natmospheric deposition, may have led to this and other changes which\r\nappear to have occurred in the climate of England within the last half\r\ncentury. In the first seven years (1833-39) after I began to keep a\r\nmeteorological record, the average annual depth of rain was 49·93\r\ninches, or 50 inches nearly; in the last seven years, ending with\r\n1848, the average is reduced to 43·74 inches. The greatest quantity in\r\nthe last 17 years is 59 inches, in 1836; the least, 34·69 inches in\r\n1842. The three driest years in the period are 1842, 1844, and 1849,\r\nwhich yielded 34·69 inches, 36·72 inches, and 39 inches.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the past year (48°·69) is about half a degree\r\n_below_ the climatic mean, which is 49°·02. The coldest year of the\r\nlast 17 was 1845, and the mildest, 1846; the mean temperatures of\r\nthese years were 47°·49 and 50°·85 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe naked thermometer on the grass, placed on raw wool, has been at or\r\nbelow the freezing point in every month of 1849; viz., in January, on\r\n19 nights; in February, on 14; in March, on 13; in April, on 18; in\r\nMay, on 11; in June, on 8; in July, on 1; in August, on 2; in\r\nSeptember, on 5; in October, on 16; in November, on 13; and in\r\nDecember, on 24 nights. The amount of radiant heat thrown off from the\r\nearth's crust at night, in the year 1849, as indicated by naked\r\nthermometers placed on raw wool and on grass, is much greater than\r\nusual. The evaporation exceeds the fall of rain in five months of\r\n1849; viz., in March, April, May, June, and September. In 1849, we\r\nhave had 12 perfectly clear days; 163 days more or less cloudy but\r\nwithout rain; 190 wet days; 261 days on which the sun shone out; 33\r\ndays of frost; 13 of hail; 7 of snow; 10 of thunder and lightning; and\r\n7 days in which lightning occurred without thunder. There have also\r\nbeen three lunar halos, one lunar rainbow, a double parhelion, and\r\nseven appearances of the aurora borealis.\r\n\r\nThe clear days are 14, the days of sunshine are 13, and the wet days\r\nare 8 _less_ than the average number. The past year has therefore\r\nafforded a smaller share of blue sky and a less amount of sunshine\r\nthan usual, although the depth of rain and the number of wet days are\r\nboth _below_ the average for the locality.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of electricity in the air was extremely small down to the\r\nend of July, after which it was restored to its average amount.\r\n\r\nThis fact is strikingly exhibited by the following table of continuous\r\nobservations taken by M. Quetelet with Peltier's electrometer:--\r\n\r\n                  Average    Mean\r\n                 1844-1848.  1849.\r\n                     °        °\r\n     January,        53       39\r\n     February,       47       36\r\n     March,          38       27\r\n     April,          27       20\r\n     May,            21       16\r\n     June,           18       13\r\n     July,           19       14\r\n     August,         21       21\r\n     September,      24       24\r\n\r\nIn 1849, the deaths exceed the calculated average number by 79, and\r\nthe births exceed the deaths by 74.\r\n\r\nIn the seven years ending with 1845, the mean annual number of deaths\r\nin the town and suburb, with an assumed population of 17,867, is 410,\r\nbeing 22·9 per thousand, or one death in every 43·5 persons. In 1846,\r\n1847, and 1848 (assumed average population 18,329), the mean annual\r\nnumber is 694, being 37·8 deaths per thousand, or 1 in every 26·4\r\npersons in those three most unhealthy years. In 1849 the deaths are\r\n606, which, assuming the population to be the same as in 1848, give\r\n32·2 deaths per 1000, or 1 death in every 31 persons. The average\r\nannual number of deaths in the ten years 1839-48 is 495, which, with\r\nan assumed population of 17,713, gives 27·9 per 1000, or 1 death in\r\nevery 35·7 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSo that the mortality in 1849, although still above the average, shews\r\na marked improvement in the health of the town as compared with any of\r\nthe three preceding years; and, in the last quarter, the deaths are\r\nbelow the average for the period.\r\n\r\n  THE OBSERVATORY, WHITEHAVEN,\r\n  _13th March 1850_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _The Completed Coral Island._\r\n                    By JAMES D. DANA, Geologist\r\n           to the American Exploratory Expedition, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coral Island, in its best condition, is but a miserable residence\r\nfor man. There is poetry in every feature; but the natives find this a\r\npoor substitute for the bread-fruit and yams of more favoured lands.\r\nThe cocoa-nut and pandanus are, in general, the only products of the\r\nvegetable kingdom afforded for their sustenance, and fish and crabs\r\nfrom the reef their only animal food. Scanty, too, is the supply; and\r\ninfanticide is resorted to in self-defence, where but a few years\r\nwould otherwise overstock the half-dozen square miles of which their\r\nlittle world consists.\r\n\r\nYet there are more comforts than might be expected on a land of so\r\nlimited extent, without rivers, without hills, in the midst of salt\r\nwater, with the most elevated point but ten feet above high tide, and\r\nno part more than 300 yards from the ocean. Though the soil is light\r\nand the surface often strewed with blocks of coral, there is a dense\r\ncovering of vegetation to shade the native villages from a tropical\r\nsun. The cocoa-nut--the tree of a thousand uses--grows luxuriantly on\r\nthe coral-made land, after it has emerged from the ocean; and the\r\nscanty dresses of the natives, their drinking-vessels and other\r\nutensils, mats, cordage, fishing-lines, and oil, besides food, drink,\r\nand building material, are all supplied from it. The_ Pandanus_, or\r\nscrew-pine, flourishes well, and is exactly fitted for such regions:\r\nas it enlarges and spreads its branches, one prop after another grows\r\nout from the trunk and plants itself in the ground; and by this means\r\nits base is widened and the growing tree supported. The fruit, a large\r\novoidal mass, made up of oblong dry seed, diverging from a centre,\r\neach near two cubic inches in size, affords a sweetish-husky article\r\nof food, which, though little better than prepared corn-stalks, admits\r\nof being stored away for use when other things fail. The extensive\r\nreefs abound in fish which are easily captured; and the natives, with\r\nwooden hooks, often bring in larger kinds from the deep waters. From\r\nsuch resources a population of 10,000 persons is supported on the\r\nsingle Island of Taputeouea, whose whole habitable area does not\r\nexceed six square miles.[30]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 30: There are a few islands better supplied with\r\n     vegetable food, though the above statements are literally true of\r\n     a large majority.\r\n\r\nWater is usually to be found in sufficient quantities for the use of\r\nthe natives, although the land is so low and flat. They dig wells five\r\nto ten feet deep in any part of the dry islets, and generally obtain a\r\nconstant supply. These wells are sometimes fenced around with special\r\ncare; and the houses of the villages, as at Fakaafo, are often\r\nclustered about them. On Aratica (Carlshoff) there is a watering-place\r\n50 feet in diameter, from which our vessels in a few hours obtained\r\n390 gallons. The Tarawan Islands are generally provided with a supply\r\nsufficient for bathing, and each native takes his morning bath in\r\nfresh water, esteemed by them a great luxury.\r\n\r\nThe only source of this water is the rains, which, percolating through\r\nthe loose surface, settle upon the hardened coral rock that forms the\r\nbasis of the island. As the soil is white, or nearly so, it receives\r\nheat but slowly, and there is consequently but little evaporation of\r\nthe water that is once absorbed.\r\n\r\nThese islands, moreover, enclose ports of great extent, many admitting\r\neven the largest class of vessels; and the same lagoons are the pearl\r\nfisheries of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAn occasional log drifts to their shores; and at some of the more\r\nisolated atolls, where the natives are ignorant of any land but the\r\nspot they inhabit; they are deemed direct gifts from a propitiated\r\ndeity. These drift-logs were noticed by Kotzebue, at the Marshall\r\nIslands, and he remarked also that they often brought stones in their\r\nroots. Similar facts were observed by us at the Tarawan group, and\r\nalso at Enderby's Island, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe stones at the Tarawan Islands, as far as we could learn, are\r\ngenerally basaltic, and they are highly valued for whetstones,\r\npestles, and hatchets. The logs are claimed by the chiefs for canoes.\r\nSome of the logs on Enderby's Island were forty feet long, and four in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nFragments of pumice and resin are transported by the waves to the\r\nTarawan Islands. We were informed that the pumice was gathered from\r\nthe shores by the women, and pounded up to fertilize the soil of their\r\ntaro patches; and it is so common, that one woman will pick up a peck\r\nin a day. Pumice was also met with at Fakaafo. Volcanic ashes are\r\nsometimes distributed over these islands, through the atmosphere; and\r\nin this manner the soil of the Tonga Islands is improved, and in some\r\nplaces it has received a reddish colour.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the \"Vincennes\" observed several large masses of\r\ncompact and cellular basalt on Rose Island, a few degrees east of\r\nSamoa: they lie two hundred yards inside of the line of breakers. The\r\nisland is uninhabited, and the origin of the stories is doubtful; they\r\nmay have been brought there by roots of trees, or perhaps by some\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great number of coral islands in the Paumotu\r\nArchipelago, the botanist finds there, as Dr Pickering informs me,\r\nonly twenty-eight or twenty-nine native species of plants. The\r\nfollowing are the most common of them: _Portulacca_, two species;\r\n_Scævola Konigii_. _Pisonia?_ one species; _Tournefortia sericea_;\r\n_Pandanus odoratissimus_; _Lepidium_, one species; _Euphorbia_, one\r\nspecies; _Morinda citrifolia_; _Boerhavia_, two species; _Cassytha_,\r\none species; _Heliotropium prostratum_, _Pemphis acidula_, _Guettarda\r\nspeciosa_, _Triumphetta procumbens_, _Sauriana maritima_;\r\n_Convolvulus_, one species; _Urtica_, one or two species; _Asplenium\r\nnidus_; _Achyranthus_, one species; a species of grass. One or two\r\nrubiaceous shrubs. _Polypodium_.\r\n\r\nOn Rose Island, Dr Pickering found only the _Pisonia_ and a\r\n_Portulacca_. The _Triumphetta procumbens_, a creeping plant, takes\r\nroot, like the _Portulacca_, in the most barren sands, and is very\r\ncommon. The _Tournefortia_ and _Scævola_ are also among the earliest\r\nspecies. The _Pisonia_, a tree of handsome foliage, the _Pandanus_, or\r\nscrew-pine, and the cocoa-nut (always an introduced species),\r\nconstitute the larger part of the forests. In the Marshall group,\r\nwhere the vegetation is more varied, Chamisso observed fifty-two\r\nnative plants, and, in a few instances, the banana, taro, and\r\nbread-fruit.\r\n\r\nThe language of the natives indicates their poverty, as well as the\r\nlimited productions and unvarying features of the land. All words,\r\nlike those for mountain, hill, river, and many of the implements of\r\ntheir ancestors, as well as the trees and other vegetation of the land\r\nfrom which they are derived, are lost to them; and as words are but\r\nsigns for ideas, they have fallen off in general intelligence. It\r\nwould be an interesting inquiry for the philosopher, to what extent a\r\nrace of men, placed in such circumstances, are capable of mental\r\nimprovement. Perhaps the query might be best answered by another: How\r\nmany of the various arts of civilized life could exist in a land where\r\nshells are the only cutting instruments? The plants, in all but\r\ntwenty-nine in number,--but a single mineral,--quadrupeds, none, with\r\nthe exception of foreign mice,--fresh water barely enough for\r\nhousehold purposes,--no streams, nor mountains, nor hills! How much of\r\nthe poetry or literature of Europe would be intelligible to persons\r\nwhose ideas had expanded only to the limits of a coral island,--who\r\nhad never conceived of a surface of land above half a mile in breadth,\r\nof a slope higher than a beach, of a change of seasons beyond a\r\nvariation in the prevalence of rains? What elevation in morals should\r\nbe expected upon a contracted islet, so readily overpeopled that\r\nthreatened starvation drives to infanticide, and tends to cultivate\r\nthe extremest selfishness? Assuredly, there is not a more unfavourable\r\nspot for moral or intellectual development in the wide world than the\r\nCoral Island, with all its beauty of grove and lake.\r\n\r\nThese islands are exposed to earthquakes and storms, like the\r\ncontinents, and occasionally a devastating wave sweeps across the\r\nland. During the heavier gales the natives sometimes secure their\r\nhouses by tying them to the cocoa-nut trees, or to a stake planted for\r\nthe purpose. A height of ten or twelve feet, the elevation of their\r\nland, is easily overtopped by the more violent seas; and great damage\r\nis sometimes experienced. The still more extensive earthquake waves,\r\nsuch as those which have swept up the coast of Spain, Peru, and the\r\nSandwich Islands, would produce a complete deluge over these\r\nislands.--(_United States' Exploring Expedition.--Geology._--_By James\r\nDana_, p. 75.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Biographical Notice of Leopold Pilla, the Geologist._\r\n           By H. COQUAND.[31] Communicated by the Author.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 31: Read to the Geological Society of France, at their\r\n     meeting on the 16th of April 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, to bring to your recollection the numerous works which have\r\nplaced Pilla among the most eminent geologists of Italy, is to do\r\nhonour to the memory of an associate, whose recent loss we lament, by\r\nbestowing well-merited praises on the greatness of mind in a citizen,\r\nwho nobly sacrificed a life already illustrious, and which the future\r\npromised to render still more so, to the good of his country. Yes,\r\nItaly has always been _tellus magna virum!_ The chances of war, the\r\nrage of civil discord, the insults of foreign domination, may have\r\neclipsed its political name, but they could not extinguish its genius.\r\nThe blast of revolutions has respected the triple halo with which the\r\nsciences, letters, and the arts, have adorned its brow. By entrusting\r\nto one of his friends the task of enumerating his scientific labours,\r\nthe Society imposes on him a very painful duty; but he undertakes it\r\nwith feeling and gratitude; for the public homage rendered to the\r\nvirtues of those whom we have loved, seems to bring them back to us,\r\nand softens the awards of destiny, which has too soon snatched them\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\nLeopold Pilla was born in the kingdom of Naples. While still young,\r\nthe exciting scenes of Vesuvius attracted his attention, and\r\ndetermined his scientific career. In 1832, he undertook to write the\r\nannals of this volcano, and gave its history in two periodical\r\ncollections.[32] It was at this period that he proved the production\r\nof flames in volcanic eruptions, and deduced from thence the ingenious\r\nconclusions which you judged worthy of a place in your memoirs.[33]\r\nThis remarkable work, which of itself would have been sufficient to\r\nestablish his scientific reputation, was soon followed by numerous\r\nothers, which shed a new lustre on his name. The study of the extinct\r\nvolcano of Rocca Monfina,[34] in the Campania, illustrated the theory\r\nof craters _de soulevement_, and enriched it with facts of the highest\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 32: Spettatore del Vesuvio et Bulletino del Vesuvio.\r\n     Napoli, 1832.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 33: Sopra la produzione delle fiamme nei vulcani, e\r\n     sopra le consequenze che se ne possono tirare.

His love for geology amounted to enthusiasm; he was\r\ntherefore so zealous in propagating his views, that certain jealous\r\nminds could not pardon him, and led him to atone for his fault, by a\r\nvoluntary exile. The apostle of the science, he likewise was its\r\nmartyr; thus nothing was wanting to his fame. It is the privilege of\r\nmen of genius to be persecuted. Obliged to yield to the storm, Pilla\r\nleft Naples, but by his writings he belonged to Italy at large; and\r\nthe unanimous acclamation which greeted him in the chair formerly\r\noccupied by Galileo, conferred on him by the liberality of the Grand\r\nDuke of Tuscany, formed at once his triumph and revenge.\r\n\r\nBesides the works mentioned, we owe to him a Mineralogical Treatise on\r\nRocks;[35] an Introduction to the Study of Mineralogy;[36] and a\r\nGeological Itinerary from Naples to Vienna.[37] Thus, by approving the\r\nnew productions which his activity produced, and which caused him to\r\nbe better appreciated by the nation which had adopted him, the Tuscans\r\nhad only to sanction the judgment they had already given of our\r\n_savant_, founded on his reputation and works.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 35: Trattato mineralogico delle Roccie, Napoli.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 36: Introduzione allo studio della geologia, Napoli.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 37: Osservazioni Geologiche che si possono fare lungo la\r\n     strada da Napoli a Vienna.\r\n\r\nPilla left his heart at Naples. That city contained all the objects of\r\nhis affections--a father, who had guided his first attempts in the\r\nfield of science, and his family--a classical soil which had revealed\r\nto him the secret of its revolutions, a majestic landscape, which he\r\ncould not find among the monotonous plains of Pisa, and above all _his\r\nown_ Vesuvius. It was in this way that he recalled to his mind the\r\nmountain which had been the subject of his daily study, and from whose\r\nsummit nature presented herself to his eyes in the most striking\r\ncontrasts, revealing to his view its subterranean convulsions,\r\nconnected with the delightful picture of the Gulf of Baia. All his\r\nthoughts brought him back to Naples. When, from the height of the\r\nterraces of Campiglia our view extended from the peaks of Mount Amiata\r\nto the banks of the Popolonia, and from the Tuscan Archipelago to the\r\ndistant horizons of Corsica and Sardinia, my poor friend often\r\ninterrupted our reveries by saying,--\"It is almost as beautiful as\r\nNaples, but my Vesuvius is wanting;\" and then adding, \"How unfortunate\r\nit is that Werner did not lay the foundation of geology at Naples; _he\r\nwould have made it Plutonian_.\" Thus the love of his country, and the\r\nrecollection of its wonders, were confounded in his mind with the\r\ncultivation of the science, and gave to his animated and poetical\r\nconversation a touching melancholy which agreeably tempered his\r\nvivacity.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of his professorship at Pisa, Pilla published, in\r\nsuccession, a comparative Essay on the formations which compose the\r\nsoil of Italy;[38] a Collection of the Mineral riches of Tuscany;[39]\r\ntwo Memoirs on the Etrurian Formation;[40] History of an Earthquake\r\nfelt in Tuscany, in 1846;[41] many notices respecting the\r\nCalcare-rosso, and on the temperature observed in the wells of\r\nMonte-Massi;[42] lastly, the first volume of his Treatise on\r\nGeology.[43] The entire work would have formed four octavo volumes.\r\nThe materials were prepared, but death left the work incomplete. As\r\nthese various writings are in the hands of all geologists, we give no\r\nanalysis of them; which indeed would only be a faint reflection from\r\nthe pictures present to your memory. I may merely say, that the\r\nelevated considerations of the general physics of the globe to which\r\nhe has risen in appreciating and investigating the causes of\r\nearthquakes, the comprehensive and methodical plan on which he has\r\nprojected this geological treatise, by affording us a proof of the\r\nfertility and maturity of his mind, shew us, at the same time, the\r\nimportance of the part reserved for a philosopher, whom death has\r\nremoved from the present scene before he had reached his thirty-sixth\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 38: Saggio comparative dei terreni che compongono il\r\n     suolo de l'Italia, Pisa.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 39: Breve cenno sopra la richezza mineralogica della\r\n     Toscano, Pisa.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 40: Sulla vera posizione del terreno di macigno in\r\n     Italia, Pisa; and Memoires de la Société geologique de France,\r\n     2me serie, t. ii.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 41: Storia del tremuoto che ha devastuto i paesi della\r\n     costa Toscana, il di 14 Agosto 1846, Pisa.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 42: Miscellanee di fisica e di Storia naturale di Pisa,\r\n     anno 1, Nos. 7 and 8.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 43: Trattato di geologia, t. i., Pisa, 1847.\r\n\r\nThe war of independence raged at the time when Pilla was about to\r\nvisit the north of Europe, in order to complete his studies in\r\npractical geology, by comparing the different formations. Every\r\ngenerous heart in Italy beat high at the report of the insurrection of\r\nMilan; and the Universities of Pisa and Sienna, by demanding arms and\r\nfirst flying to the scene of danger, shewed that hearts, proved in the\r\nfire of science, are prepared for great things. Pilla marched at the\r\nhead of his pupils, and led them in the path of glory, as he had done\r\nin that of philosophy. The love of country and thirst for\r\nindependence, by subjugating his heart, had stifled the calculation of\r\nreason under the impulse and delirium of enthusiasm. He had foreseen\r\nthe issue of the struggle; for he said to me some days before setting\r\nout for the plains of Lombardy, \"the hour of our fall has struck.\r\nItaly loses by fourteen ages of servitude the splendour of her early\r\ndays. They are leading us to slaughter; but we must teach our children\r\nhow to die, in order that they may know how they may one day become\r\nfree.\"\r\n\r\nThe University legion formed a small corps which was placed on the\r\nright wing of the Piedmontese army, and occupied the positions of\r\nCurtatone and Montanara. The principal effort of the Austrian army was\r\ndirected against these lines, in the affair of the 29th May 1848.\r\nAttacked by 13,000 imperial troops, the Tuscans resisted courageously,\r\nand did not fall back till they had left 250 of their men on the field\r\nof battle.

BRONGNIART.\r\n\r\n                 (_Continued from p. 330 of Volume 48._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"II. _Permian Period._--The nature of the vegetables which appear\r\npeculiar to this epoch, is far from being determined in a positive\r\nmanner; for the few localities where the fossils we consider as\r\nbelonging to it, have hitherto been found, are not perhaps really of a\r\nformation very identical and truly contemporaneous. For it may be\r\nasked, whether the bituminous and copper slates of the county of\r\nMansfield, classed by all geologists with the zechstein, and the\r\nsandstone of Russia, placed by M. M. Murchison and Verneuil in their\r\nPermian formation, are really contemporaneous? Finally, is there\r\ngreater reason for classifying the slates of Lodève, considered by M.\r\nM. Dufresnoy and Elie de Beaumont as depending on the variegated\r\nsandstone, but so different from the same sandstone of the Vosges in\r\nits _flora_, in this period, which would thus be a kind of passage\r\nfrom the coal period, so well characterised, to the vosgian or\r\nvariegated sandstone, which differs from it in so decided a manner?\"\r\n\r\nOn account of these doubts, M. Brongniart indicates these three floras\r\nseparately; _1st_, The Flora of the bituminous slates of Thuringia,\r\ncomposed of algæ, ferns, and coniferæ; _2d_, The Flora of the Permian\r\nsandstones of Russia, which comprehends ferns, equisetaceæ,\r\nlycopodiaceæ, and noeggerathiæ; _3d_, The Flora of the slates of\r\nLodève, which is composed of ferns, asterophylliteæ, and coniferæ.\r\n\r\n\"We perceive that there are great specific differences between the\r\nplants of these localities, and that hitherto no species common to\r\nthem has been found. Must we ascribe these differences to the\r\ninfluence of the great diversity of geographical position, or is\r\nthere, besides, a difference in the period of their origin among these\r\nformations? The only character which tends to bring these two latter\r\nFloras near each other, is the relation which both of them bear to the\r\ncoal-formations, of which they seem to be a kind of extract, reminding\r\nus more especially of the most recent beds.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the plants of the bituminous slates of the Mansfeld\r\ndistrict, they are so few in number, and appear to have been deposited\r\nin conditions so different, that we can with difficulty compare them\r\nwith the two other Floras. Yet the species of Sphenopteris are\r\nextremely like each other in the three formations, and an exact\r\ncomparison would perhaps establish the identity of many of them. The\r\nPecopteris crenulata of Ilmenau, is only perhaps an imperfect state of\r\nthe Pecopteris abbreviata of Lodève; lastly, the Callipteris of the\r\nPermian formation of Lodève have a very close connection between\r\nthemselves and the Callipteris of the coal-formation.\r\n\r\n\"We may add, with regard to the bituminous slates of Thuringia, that\r\nmany of these fossils appear to be marine plants, whose numbers would\r\nbecome much more considerable if we did not suppress all the imperfect\r\nimpressions which have been described as such, and which are nothing\r\nmore than fragments of ferns or altered coniferæ.\r\n\r\n\"II. REIGN OF THE GYMNOSPERMS.--During the preceding periods, and\r\nparticularly during the Carboniferous period, the Acrogenous\r\ncryptogams predominated, and the Gymnospermous dicotyledons, less\r\nnumerous, shewed themselves in unusual forms, and sometimes so\r\nanomalous that we are in doubt whether to place them in this or the\r\npreceding department; such are the Asterophylliteæ. At a later period,\r\non the contrary, these anomalous and ambiguous forms, whose\r\nclassification is often obscure, disappear; Acrogenous cryptogams and\r\nGymnospermous dicotyledons evidently enter into families still\r\nexisting, differing from them only in generic forms; the Ferns and\r\nEquisetaceæ, which represent the acrogens, are less numerous; the\r\nConiferæ and Cycadeæ almost equal them in number, and usually exceed\r\nthem in frequency, especially in the second period; by their abundance\r\nand size they afford the essential character of all these formations;\r\nlastly, the Angiospermous dicotyledons are wholly wanting, and the\r\nmonocotyledons are in very small numbers.\r\n\r\n\"This reign of the Gymnospermous dicotyledons is divided into two\r\nperiods; the first, in which the Coniferæ predominate, and in which\r\nthe Cycadeæ scarcely appear; the second, in which this family becomes\r\npredominating in the number of species, in frequency and variety of\r\ngeneric forms. The latter may be divided into many epochs, each\r\npresenting peculiar characters.\r\n\r\n\"III. _Vosgian Period._--This period, which does not appear to have\r\nbeen of long duration, and comprehends only the _variegated_ sandstone\r\nproperly so called, presents the following characters; _1st_, The\r\nexistence of ferns, pretty numerous, of forms very often anomalous,\r\nevidently constituting genera now extinct, and which are not found\r\neven in the most recent formations; such are the Anomopteris and the\r\nCrematopteris. Stems of arborescent ferns are more frequent than\r\nduring the Jurassic period; true Equisetums are very rare; the\r\nCalamites, or rather perhaps the Calamodendrons, are abundant. _2d_,\r\nThe Gymnosperms are represented by two genera of Coniferæ, _Voltzia_\r\nand _Haidingeria_, of which the species and specimens are very\r\nnumerous. The Cycadeæ, on the contrary, are very rare. M. Schimper\r\nmentions only two species founded on two unique specimens of a very\r\nimperfect character, and the determination of which may be considered\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n\"This consideration appears to me to separate completely, in a\r\nbotanical point of view, the period of the variegated sandstone from\r\nthat of the Keuper, although both are placed by geologists in the\r\ntrias-formation. For the Cycadeæ become very abundant in the Keuper,\r\nare perfectly characterised, and often analogous to those of the\r\nJurassic period; while the Coniferæ of the variegated sandstone are,\r\non the contrary, wanting in this formation.\r\n\r\n\"IV. _Jurassic Period._--This period is one of the most extensive by\r\nthe formations which it comprehends, and the variety of different\r\nspecial epochs of vegetation which it embraces; although we cannot\r\nrefuse to comprehend, under a common title, epochs during which very\r\nanalogous forms have succeeded each other. It thus comprehends from\r\nthe Keuper inclusively, up to the Wealdean formations. In fact, we\r\nfind the Pterophyllum of the Keuper appear anew, with slight specific\r\ndifferences in the Wealdean formations. The _equisetites_ of the\r\nKeuper extend to the mean oolithic formation; the _baiera_ of the Lias\r\nlikewise recurs in the Wealdean beds of the north of Germany; the\r\nSagenopteris and the Camptopteris likewise appear in the Keuper, Lias,\r\nand Oolite.\r\n\r\n\"Yet these common characters, which indicate a great analogy between\r\nthe Floras of each of these epochs of formation, do not prevent each\r\nof them having characters of its own, and often an assemblage of\r\nspecies, almost all peculiar to each particular epoch. We ought,\r\ntherefore, to distinguish here those various subdivisions, the number\r\nof which will perhaps be afterwards multiplied, when we become better\r\nacquainted with the vegetables of each of the stages of the Jurassic\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n\"_Keupric Epoch._--M. Brongniart then gives an enumeration of the\r\nvegetables of the Keupric epoch, which, in regard to the Amphigenous\r\ncryptogams, consist of Algæ; in regard to the Acrogenous cryptogams,\r\nof Ferns and Equisetaceæ; in the case of the Gymnospermous\r\ndicotyledons of Cycadeæ and Coniferæ; lastly, of two doubtful\r\nmonocotyledons (_Palæoxyris_ and _Preisleria_.)\r\n\r\n\"On comparing this Flora with that of the variegated sandstone of the\r\nVosges, and with that of the Lias, we perceive that it has nothing in\r\ncommon with the first except the palæoxyris, which appears very nearly\r\nrelated to that of the variegated sandstone; on the contrary, it\r\nresembles the Flora of the Lias or Oolite in the ferns, many of which\r\nare specifically identical, or nearly allied in the _Nilsonia_ and\r\n_Pterophyllum_, which are likewise either identical, or very nearly\r\nconnected specifically with the Lias.\r\n\r\n\"_Lias Epoch._--The Liasic epoch furnishes Amphigenous cryptogams,\r\nconsisting of Algæ, mushrooms, and lichens; Acrogenous cryptogams,\r\nsuch as Ferns, Marsileaceæ, Lycopodiaceæ, and Equisetaceæ;\r\nGymnospermous dicotyledons, represented by the Cycadeæ and Coniferæ;\r\nfinally, doubtful monocotyledons, consisting of _Proacites_ and\r\n_Cyperites_.\r\n\r\n\"The essential characters of this epoch are therefore, _1st_, The\r\ngreat predominance of Cycadeæ, already well established, and the\r\npresence of numerous genera in this family, particularly _Zamites_ and\r\n_Nilsonia_; _2d_, The existence of many genera among the ferns with\r\nreticulated nerves, which scarcely shew themselves, and under forms\r\nnot greatly varied, in the most ancient formations; but some of which,\r\nnotwithstanding, already begin to appear in the epoch of the Keuper.\r\nSuch are the _Camptopteris_ and _Thaumatopteris_.\r\n\r\n\"_Oolitic Epoch._--The Oolitic epoch furnishes, among Amphigenous\r\ncryptogams, the Algæ; among the Acrogenous cryptogams, Ferns,\r\nMarsileaceæ, Lycopodiaceæ, and Equisetaceæ; among the Gymnospermous\r\ndicotyledons, Cycadeæ and Coniferæ; lastly, among the doubtful\r\nmonocotyledons, Podocarya and Carpolithes.\r\n\r\n\"This list is chiefly founded on the fossils, so varied in character,\r\ncollected on the coasts of Yorkshire, near Whitby and Scarborough, in\r\nbeds which are referred to different parts of the inferior oolite, and\r\nparticularly to the great oolite. It likewise contains a small number\r\nof species found in the slaty limestone of Stonesfield, near Oxford,\r\ndepending on these same beds.\r\n\r\n\"In France, the fossils of this formation have been collected in the\r\nneighbourhood of Morestel, near Lyon, by Dr Lortet; at Orbagnoux and\r\nAbergemens, near Nantua, in the department of the Ain, by M. Itier; in\r\nthe vicinity of Chateauroux, near Châtillon-sur-Seine, by Colonel\r\nMoret; at Mamers, in the department of Sarthe, by M. Desnoyers; and,\r\nlastly, in the greatest quantity by M. Moreau, in beds of oolithic\r\nlimestone of a very pure white, in the neighbourhood of Verdun, and\r\nnear Vaucouleurs. Some species have likewise been found at other\r\npoints of the Jura, in Normandy, near Valogne, in the neighbourhood of\r\nAlençon, in each of these localities in very small number. But the\r\ngreater part of these species are not yet described and figured, and\r\nthey generally differ as species from those of England. The ferns are\r\ngenerally less numerous, and not so well preserved; we must, however,\r\nexcept the _Hymenophyllites macrophyllus_, found in a perfect state at\r\nMorestel, and likewise observed at Stonesfield, and in Germany. The\r\nCycadeæ, the species of which are not greatly varied, are referrible\r\nto the genera _Otozamites_ and _Zamites_; Ctenis, Pterophyllum, and\r\nNilsonia have not yet been observed; lastly, the Coniferæ of the genus\r\n_Brachyphyllum_ are there particularly abundant, and more frequent\r\nthan in the other localities.\r\n\r\n\"In Germany, it is more especially in the slaty limestone of\r\nSolenhofen, near Aichstædt, that these fossils have been observed, and\r\nparticularly those of the family of Algæ. M. Gæppert likewise notices\r\nmany Cycadeæ in the Jurassic formation of Ludwigsdorf, near Kreuzburg,\r\nin Silesia.\r\n\r\n\"But these localities, so diverse, are referrible to very different\r\nstages of the Oolithic series, and perhaps will constitute, when they\r\nare better known, and more fully explored, distinct epochs.\r\n\r\n\"The distinctive characters of this epoch, comprising the whole extent\r\nwe have assigned to it, from the Lias to the Wealdean formation\r\nexclusively, are; among the Ferns, the rarity of ferns with\r\nreticulated nervures, so numerous in the Lias; among the Cycadeæ, the\r\nfrequency of _Otozamites_ and _Zamites_, properly so called; that is\r\nto say, Cycadeæ most analogous to those of the existing period, and\r\nthe diminution of _Ctenis_, _Pterophyllum_, and _Nilsonia_, genera\r\nmuch more remote from living species; finally, the greater frequency\r\nof Coniferæ, viz., _Brachyphyllum_ and _Thuites_, much rarer in the\r\nLias.\r\n\r\n\"_Wealdean Epoch._--This epoch affords, Amphigenous cryptogams, the\r\nAlgæ; among Acrogenous cryptogams, Ferns, _Marsileaceæ_, and\r\n_Equisetaceæ_; among Gymnospermous dicotyledons, _Cycadeæ_ and\r\n_Coniferæ_; lastly, some Carpolithes as plants of a doubtful class.\r\n\r\n\"This enumeration results principally from discoveries made, in recent\r\nyears, in the Wealdean formations of the north of Germany, at\r\nOsterwald, Schaumberg, Buckeburg, Oberkirke, &c., of which the fossil\r\nplants were first described by M. Ræmer, and afterwards in a more\r\ncomplete manner by M. Dunker, in his monograph of these formations. To\r\nthese species must be added others, less numerous and varied,\r\npreviously discovered in the _Wealds_ of England, near Tilgate Forest,\r\nand Hastings in Sussex, and which are so well described by M.\r\nMantell.\"\r\n\r\nThis same formation has likewise been found in France, near Beauvais,\r\nby M. Graves, who observed there _Lonchopteris Mantelli_, and some\r\nother plants, of which M. Brongniart has not seen specimens, and which\r\nhe quotes from Graves on the geology of the department of the Oise.\r\n\r\n\"These species, 61 in number, enumerated above, appear to be all\r\npeculiar to this formation, with the exception, perhaps, of _Baiera\r\nHuttoni_, which seems to be identical with the species of the Bayreuth\r\nLias and Scarborough Lias; but their generic forms are almost all the\r\nsame as those of the Lias and Oolitic formations. The Cycadeæ,\r\nhowever, already appear less numerous relatively to the ferns.\r\n\r\n\"We further observe, that this fresh-water formation, which, according\r\nto our view, terminates the reign of the Gymnosperms is connected, by\r\nthe whole of its characters with other epochs of the vegetation of the\r\nJurassic formation, and is distinguished from the Cretaceous epoch,\r\nwhich succeeds it, by the complete absence of every species which\r\ncould be arranged among the Angiospermous dicotyledons, both in France\r\nand England, as well as in the deposits of northern Germany, so rich\r\nin varied species. On the contrary, in the lower chalk, cretaceous\r\n_glauconia_, the quadersandstein or planerkalk of Germany, we\r\nimmediately find many kinds of leaves evidently belonging to the great\r\ndivision of Angiospermous dicotyledons, as well as some remains of\r\npalms, of which no trace is observable in the Wealdean deposits.\r\n\r\n\"I class among the Cycadeæ the stems of the Tilgate forest, formerly\r\ndesignated by the name of _Clatharia Lyellii_, and which I have\r\nconsidered as a stem related to the _Dracæna_. The whole of its\r\ncharacters, although the almost entire absence of the tissues prevents\r\nus examining its anatomy, appear to me to render this connection most\r\nprobable, and particularly to indicate the relations between this stem\r\nand that of _Zamites gigas_ found at Scarborough.\r\n\r\n\"The abundance of Lonchopteris Mantelli is a character of the Wealdean\r\nformations of the south of England and the department of the Oise,\r\nwhere this fossil seems to make its appearance, at least in fragments,\r\nin the greater number of localities, where these beds are exposed by\r\nthe excavation of potter's clay in this formation, near Savignies. In\r\nGermany, on the contrary, this species is wanting, and _Abietites\r\nLinkii_ becomes the predominating plant. With regard to Brachyphyllum,\r\nI have not yet had it in my power to study them in a natural state;\r\nbut the figures given of them leave little doubt as to their analogy\r\nwith the species of the Oolitic epoch.\r\n\r\n\"The abundance of the Cycadeæ likewise forms a distinctive character\r\nof the Wealdean formations of Germany. Still there are, as has been\r\nseen, many species common to the two basins; and I may add, that\r\nprobably the Sphenopteris Goepperti, _Dunk._, does not differ from\r\nSphenopteris Phillipsii, _Mant._\r\n\r\n\"I have not included in this list some marine plants mentioned as\r\nbelonging to the beds of this epoch; _1st_, because it appears to me\r\ndoubtful whether they really belong to the Wealdean and not to the\r\nGlauconian epoch; _2dly_, because it still appears to me uncertain,\r\nwhether the species mentioned, Chondrites æqualis and intricatus, are\r\nquite identical, specifically with the species of this name belonging\r\nto the fucoidal sandstone lying above the chalk.\r\n\r\n\"III. REIGN OF THE ANGIOSPERMS.--The dominating character of this last\r\ntransformation of the vegetation of the globe, is the appearance of\r\nAngiospermous dicotyledons, those vegetables which actually constitute\r\nmore than three-fourths of the vegetable creation of our epoch, and\r\nwhich appear to have acquired this predominance from the commencement\r\nof the Tertiary formations. For a long period I was of opinion that\r\nthese vegetables did not begin to appear till after the chalk, with\r\nthe earliest beds of the Tertiary formations; but more recent\r\ninvestigation has shewn that beds belonging to the Chalk formation\r\npresent some very distinct examples.\r\n\r\n\"These vegetables appear even at the beginning of the Chalk formation;\r\nfor it is certain that many well-determined species exist in the\r\nquadersandstein and planerkalk of Germany, which appear to correspond\r\nto the green sandstone of France, or green sand of English geologists;\r\nalthough this formation in France and England has never yielded any of\r\nthem, but only some examples of Cycadeæ, Coniferæ, and marine plants.\r\nBut in southern Sweden, at Kopingue in Scania, some specimens of\r\ndicotyledonous leaves appear associated with a species of Cycadeæ, in\r\nbeds which have been referred to the greensand; so that the whole\r\nChalk formation would appear to constitute a first period in the reign\r\nof the Angiosperms, forming, so to speak, the passage between the\r\nvegetation of the Secondary and that of the Tertiary formations, still\r\npresenting, as the first, a few Cycadeæ, as the following, some\r\nAngiospermous dicotyledons, and thus paving the way to the\r\nconsiderable development of these vegetables in the succeeding period.\r\nThis period is besides characterised by many Coniferæ peculiar to it,\r\nand which appear very distinct from those of the Wealdean formations,\r\nand from those of the Eocene epoch of the Tertiary formations; and\r\nsuch in particular are the _Cunninghamites_.\r\n\r\n\"We can therefore distinguish two great periods in the reign of the\r\nAngiosperms:\r\n\r\n\"_1st_, The Cretaceous period, a kind of period of transition.\r\n\r\n\"_2dly_, The Tertiary period, presenting all the characters arising\r\nfrom the predominance of Angiosperms, Dicotyledons, and\r\nMonocotyledons, and divisible into many epochs, the characters of\r\nwhich will not be well established until we have removed all doubts as\r\nto the agreement of the different local series of the Tertiary\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n\"V. _Cretaceous Period._--The Cretaceous period, properly so called,\r\ncomprehends perhaps many distinct epochs; but the beds where fossil\r\nvegetables have been observed, not having been always classified with\r\nprecision in the different subdivisions of this formation, it is\r\nimpossible to establish their chronology with certainty. Besides, we\r\nmust distinguish an epoch which appears immediately to precede this\r\nformation, and one which follows it, and yet differs from the Eocene\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\"We are acquainted with fossil vegetables of the Cretaceous period:--\r\n\r\n\"_1st, Sub-Cretaceous Epoch_.--In the subcretaceous marine lignites of\r\nthe Isle of Aix, near La Rochelle, and of Pialpinson, in the\r\ndepartment of the Dordogne; these are the most ancient beds of the\r\nCretaceous formation, or the last of the Jurassic period. Here have\r\nbeen found only marine plants, wood, and branches of Coniferæ.\r\n\r\n\"_2d_, In the chloriteous chalk or greensand of southern England, the\r\nneighbourhood of Beauvais and Maus; only Cycadeæ and marine plants\r\nhave been observed there.\r\n\r\n\"_3d_, In the same formation in Scania, where M. Nilson has observed\r\nleaves of Dicotyledons mixed with leaves of Cycadites.\r\n\r\n\"_4th_, At Niederschoena, near Freyberg, in Saxony, beds, analogous to\r\ngreensand or quadersandstein, containing fossils of considerable\r\nvariety, Cycadeæ, Coniferæ, and Dicotyledons, particularly\r\n_Credneria_.\r\n\r\n\"_5th_, In the quadersandstein of Bohemia and Silesia, at Blankenburg,\r\nat Teifenfurth, Teschen, &c., where this sandstone is characterised by\r\nthe presence of dicotyledonous leaves of the genus _Credneria_, by\r\nCyeadeæ, and particularly by Coniferæ of considerable variety,\r\ndescribed by M. Corda in Reuss' work on the Chalk of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n\"_6th_, In France, in the iron sands connected with the green\r\nsandstones, near Grand-Pré, in the department of Ardennes, where M.\r\nBuvignier has found two fossil vegetables of a very remarkable\r\ncharacter, a stalk of an arborescent fern, and a cone previously\r\nobserved in England in the same formation.\r\n\r\n\"But in other places, and in beds belonging to epochs certainly\r\ndifferent, this period has presented only marine vegetables; such more\r\nespecially are those fucoidal sandstones or macigno, characterised by\r\nChondrites targionii, æqualis, intricatus, &c., now designated by the\r\nname of fucoidal sandstone or flysch--the geological epoch of which\r\nhas long been doubtful, but which observers seem to agree in\r\nconsidering as a distinct formation, superior to the chalk, and\r\ninferior to the most ancient beds of the Tertiary formations.\r\n\r\n\"These fucoidal sandstones form a very distinct epoch, which hitherto\r\nappears to be characterised only by marine vegetables, and what, at\r\nleast in a botanical point of view, would form the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the Cretaceous and Tertiary formations; for it is remarkable\r\nthat the fuci found there in such great numbers have little connection\r\nwith those of the Chalk, properly so called, and none whatever with\r\nthose of the most ancient beds of the Tertiary formations, such as\r\nthose of Monte-Bolca.\r\n\r\n\"From the study and comparison of these fossils, derived from such\r\nvarious sources, we may divide the Cretaceous period into three\r\nepochs, of which the middle one is the true Cretaceous epoch. The\r\nothers, characterised almost exclusively by marine vegetables, are\r\nsomewhat doubtful with regard to their true geological position; the\r\none, more ancient than the Chalk, contains only the subcretaceous\r\nlignites of the neighbourhood of La Rochelle, and the Department of\r\nDordogne; the other, superior to the Chalk, corresponds to the\r\nSandstone with fucoides.\"\r\n\r\nThe _subcretaceous_ epoch comprehends Algæ, Naiadeæ, and Coniferæ.\r\n\r\n\"This small Flora is almost entirely founded on fossil plants,\r\ncollected among the marine lignites of the Isle of Aix, near La\r\nRochelle, long since described by M. Fleureau de Bellevue.\r\n\r\n\"The difference of the vegetables does not appear to admit of\r\nconnecting this Flora with that of the inferior chalk or greensand;\r\nbut it would require to be more completely examined, both with regard\r\nto its precise geological epoch and the entire amount of vegetable\r\nspecies which it contains. The most abundant and characteristic of\r\nthese species is the _Rhodomelites strictus_, whose branches, crossed\r\nand mingled with _Zosterites_, constitute the mass of these lignites\r\nwith the wood of Coniferæ, which have not yet been studied, and small\r\nbranchlets, very rare, of _Brachyphyllum orbignianum_.\r\n\r\n\"I have referred to this period the two _Cystoseirites_, described by\r\nM. de Sternberg, and mentioned by him as found in the beds between the\r\njurassic slates and the chalk in Transylvania.\r\n\r\n\"Does this fossil Flora correspond to a formation almost entirely\r\nmarine, but cotemporary with the Wealdean epoch? New investigations\r\ncan alone determine this, but we may suppose an analogy between the\r\nBrachyphyllum of the epochs.\"\r\n\r\n_2d_, _Cretaceous Epoch_.--The Cretaceous epoch presents us, among the\r\namphigenous cryptogams, with Algæ, some of which are doubtful; among\r\nthe Acrogenous cryptogams, with ferns; the Monoctyledons are here\r\nrepresented by two species of palms; the Gymnospermous dicotyledons by\r\nthe cycadeæ and coniferæ; the Angiospermous dicotyledons by a species\r\nof Acerineæ, a betulaceæ, a cupulifera, salicineæ, an acerineæ, and a\r\njuglandeæ; lastly, a few dicotyledons remain, but the determination of\r\nthe families to which they belong is uncertain.\r\n\r\n\"We ought, moreover, to notice at least from ten to twelve species of\r\ndicotyledonous leaves, indeterminate, and often imperfect, figured by\r\nGeinitz, Reuss, Corda, and Goeppert, or existing in collections.\r\n\r\n\"This Flora, which contains from sixty to seventy species, is, as we\r\nperceive, remarkable in this respect, that the Angiospermous\r\ndicotyledons nearly equal the Gymnospermous dicotyledons, and in the\r\nexistence of a pretty considerable number of well characterised\r\nCycadeæ, which cease to appear at the Eocene epoch of the Tertiary\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n\"The genus _Credneria_, containing dicotyledonous leaves, with a very\r\npeculiar nervation, but the affinities of which are doubtful, is\r\nlikewise one of the characteristic forms of this epoch, in a pretty\r\nconsiderable number of localities. With regard to the species of\r\ndicotyledonous leaves, referred to determined families, I may remark\r\nthat these supposed relations, founded on very imperfect specimens,\r\nand very few in number, are still very uncertain, and incapable of\r\nfurnishing a basis for comparison with the other Floras, nor any\r\ncertain conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"_3d_, _Fucoidian Epoch_.--This epoch, which seems to me to form the\r\nmost natural limit between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods, is\r\ncharacterised by those deposits, so rich in Algæ, of a very peculiar\r\nform, that they have been called the sandstones or macignos à\r\nfucoïdes, or the flysch of Switzerland,--a formation very widely\r\nspread, especially in southern Europe, from the Pyrenees, as far as\r\nthe vicinity of Vienna, and even to the Crimea.\r\n\r\n\"I have not hitherto found land plants mingled with these marine\r\nspecies. I do not believe that fossil woods have been met with.\r\n\r\n\"Almost all these Algæ appear to belong to the same group, the genus\r\n_Chondrites_; and although the species are pretty numerous, they pass\r\nfrom one to another by almost insensible shades. The Algæ of the\r\nneighbourhood of Vienna, placed in the genus _Munsteria_, are very ill\r\ncharacterised, and perhaps are not congenerous with those of the\r\njurassic limestone of Solenhofen; but they appear to me to have been\r\nfound in the same formation, designated by the name of gray calcareous\r\nslate, of the sandstone of Vienna, as the Chondrites of the same\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe Flora of the fucoidean sandstone is constituted by twelve species\r\nof Algæ (_Chondrites_ and _Munsteria_.)\r\n\r\n\"What is remarkable in this series of species is, that they have\r\nnothing in common, either with the Algæ of the Subcretaceous epoch, or\r\nwith those of the Eocene epoch, and particularly of Monte-Bolca, with\r\nwhich this Flora should be almost cotemporary, according to many\r\ngeologists. The identity of these species of Algæ is likewise\r\nremarkable in all the localities, however distant from each\r\nother--localities so numerous, in regard to the greater number of\r\nthese species, that I have been unable to enumerate them.\r\n\r\n\"The Chondrites targionii, or perhaps a distinct species, but very\r\nnearly related, is the only one presented in another formation, in the\r\ngreensand and gault of the Isle of Wight, in England, according to M.\r\nFitton; and in this same formation, in the department of the Oise,\r\naccording to M. Graves.\r\n\r\n\"M. Kurr has likewise described and figured, under the name of\r\n_Chondrites bollensis_, a fucus of the Lias--the very varied forms of\r\nwhich are almost identical with the Chondrites targionii, æqualis, and\r\ndifformis.\r\n\r\n\"VI. _Tertiary Period._--Considered as a whole, the vegetables of this\r\nperiod, cotemporary with all the Tertiary deposits, and continued even\r\nin the vegetation which now covers the earth's surface, is one of the\r\nbest characterised. The abundance of Angiospermous dicotyledons, that\r\nof the monocotyledons of diverse families, but especially the Palms,\r\nduring a part at least of this period, immediately distinguish it from\r\nthe most ancient periods. Yet the observations made on the Cretaceous\r\nepoch have established a kind of transition between the forms of the\r\nSecondary epochs and those of the Tertiary epochs, which was not\r\nsuspected a few years ago. But while, at this period, the Angiosperms\r\nappear nearly to equal the Gymnosperms, in the Tertiary period, they\r\ngreatly exceed them; while at the Cretaceous epoch, there are still\r\nCycadeæ and Coniferæ allied to the genera inhabiting tropical regions;\r\nduring the Tertiary period, the Cycadeæ appear to have been completely\r\nwanting in Europe, and the Coniferæ belong to the genera of the\r\ntemperate regions.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding this assemblage of characters common to the whole\r\nTertiary period, there are evidently notable differences in the\r\ngeneric and specific forms, and in the predominance of certain\r\nfamilies at different epochs of this long period; but here we often\r\nexperience serious difficulties in establishing a uniformity as to\r\ntime among the numerous local formations which constitute the\r\ndifferent Tertiary formations. In assigning the different localities\r\nwhere fossil vegetables have been observed to the principal divisions\r\nof the Tertiary series, I have not followed exactly the bases admitted\r\nby M. Unger in his Synopsis; I have approached nearer to the\r\ndistribution adopted by M. Raulin, in his Memoir on the\r\nTransformations of the Flora of Central Europe during the Tertiary\r\nperiod (Ann. Sc. Nat., t. x., p. 193, Oct. 1848), which refers many of\r\nthe formations, classified by M. Unger in the Miocene division, to the\r\nPliocene, or most recent epoch. Yet, according to the advice of M.\r\nElie de Beaumont, I have not placed all the Lignite formations of\r\nGermany in the Pliocene division, as M. Raulin has done, nor all of\r\nthem in the Miocene division, like M. Unger; but, conformably to the\r\nold opinion of my father, I have left the Lignites from the shores of\r\nthe Baltic, which include amber, in the inferior division of the old\r\nbasins of Paris, London, and Brussels, considering them cotemporary\r\nwith the Soisson Lignites. Those of the banks of the Rhine, of\r\nWetteravia and Westphalia, are arranged in the Miocene division; those\r\nof Styria, and part of Bohemia, on the contrary, are placed among the\r\nrecent or Pliocene formations.\r\n\r\n\"This distribution agrees pretty generally with the nature of the\r\nvegetables contained in them. One important point only leaves me in\r\ndoubt: this relates to the Lignites of the environs of Frankfort or\r\nWetteravia, the plants of which are pretty generally analogous to\r\nthose of OEningen or Partschlug in Styria; although their geological\r\nposition seems to call upon us to refer them to a more ancient\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n\"It is probable that a more complete knowledge of these diverse\r\ndeposits would lead to a division into distinct epochs more numerous;\r\nbut I think that, in the meantime, the division into three principal\r\nepochs, which I shall designate, with the majority of geologists, by\r\nthe names Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene, is sufficient for a\r\ncomparison of the successive changes of the vegetable kingdom. I shall\r\npoint out for each of them the localities which I think should be\r\ncomprehended under these different designations.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the general characters which result from the\r\ncomparative examinations of these Floras, we find that the number of\r\nspecies, in the great divisions, are thus distributed in these three\r\nFloras:--\r\n\r\n                     Eocene         Miocene       Pliocene\r\n                     Epoch.          Epoch.        Epoch.\r\n                    --------       --------       --------\r\n  Cryptogams,       33   ...        10  ...        13  ...\r\n    Amphigenous,    ...   16       ...    6       ...    6\r\n    Acrogenous,     ...   17       ...    4       ...    7\r\n  Phanerogams,      ...  ...       ...  ...       ...  ...\r\n    Monocotyledons,  33   33        26   26         4    4\r\n    Dicotyledons,   143  ...        97  ...       195  ...\r\n    Gymnosperms,    ...   40       ...   19       ...   31\r\n    Angiosperms,    ...  103       ...   78       ...  164\r\n                   ---------       --------       --------\r\n  Total,            209  ...        209 ...       212  ...\r\n\r\n\"It may only be remarked that, in the first column, or Eocene\r\nformation, the fossil fruits of the Isle of Sheppey--a part only of\r\nwhich have been described by M. Bowerbank--have a great influence on\r\nthe numbers of the different divisions of Phanerogams, and that this\r\nlocality appears altogether exceptional, and is, perhaps, an example\r\nof the effect of currents conveying exotic fruits from remote\r\nclimates, and accumulating them on a point of the shores of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"In this point of view, the enumeration of the plants of this first\r\nepoch is in no way comparable to that of the other epochs, where I\r\nhave refrained even from introducing the small number of fossil plants\r\nfrom the Tertiary formations of the equatorial regions that are known,\r\nin order to confine myself to a comparison of the Tertiary Floras of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the characters drawn from vegetable forms during these\r\nthree epochs, the most remarkable appear to me, 1_st_, In the Eocene\r\nperiod, the presence, but rarity, of the palms, limited to a small\r\nnumber of species.\r\n\r\n\"The predominance of Algæ and marine Monocotyledons, which must be\r\nascribed to the great extent of marine formations during this epoch.\r\n\r\n\"The existence of a great number of extra European forms, resulting\r\nespecially from the presence of the fossil fruits of Sheppey.\r\n\r\n\"2_d_, In regard to the Miocene epoch, the abundance of palms in the\r\ngreater number of localities belonging, without doubt, to this epoch;\r\nthe existence of a considerable number of non-European forms, in\r\nparticular of the genus _Steinhauera_, which appears to me to be a\r\nrubiaceæ allied to _nauclea_, found in many localities of these\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n\"3_d_, In regard to the Pliocene epoch, the great predominance and\r\nvariety of Dicotyledons, the rarity of Monocotyledons, and, above all,\r\nthe absence of Palms; lastly, the general analogy of the forms of\r\nthese plants with those of the temperate regions of Europe, North\r\nAmerica, and Japan.\r\n\r\n\"A remarkable character of the Floras of these three epochs, but which\r\nis most striking in regard to the last, in which the dicotyledonous\r\nplants are most numerous, is the absence of the most numerous and\r\ncharacteristic families of the division of Gamopetalis. Thus, among\r\nthe numerous impressions of Partschlug, OEningen, Hoerring, Radoboj,\r\n&c., there is nothing to indicate the existence of the Compositæ,\r\nCampanulaceæ, Personneæ, Labiaceæ, Solaniæ, Boraginaæ, &c.\r\n\r\n\"The only Monopetales mentioned in great numbers are the Ericaceæ,\r\nIlicineæ, some Sapotaceæ, and Styraceæ, families which belong almost\r\nas much to the Dialypetales as to the Gamopetales.\r\n\r\n\"In the Miocene flora only have been pointed out many Apocyneæ, and\r\nRubiaceæ, which I have mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\"1. _Eocene Epoch._--This epoch, in the most precise limits,\r\ncomprehends plastic clay with its lignites, the coarse Parisian\r\nlimestone and gypsum which lie above it in the same basin; but I have\r\nnot thought it worth while, in the meantime, to separate from it some\r\nformations which, according to the investigations of modern\r\ngeologists, are placed between the Cretaceous formations and the\r\ninferior parts of the formations mentioned; such are the Nummulitic\r\nformations of the Vicentin, comprehending the celebrated locality of\r\nMonte-Bolca, and probably some others near it, such as Salcedo, in the\r\nVicentin. I have likewise joined to this Flora of the Eocene\r\nformations a very remarkable locality of the basin of Paris, the\r\nrelations of which with the Tertiary beds are not yet perfectly\r\ndetermined,--these are the beds of a species of ancient Travertin\r\nwhich, near Sezanne, contain numerous fossil vegetables still\r\nundescribed, and of which I shall here notice the most remarkable.\r\nThese plants have very peculiar remains, and belong probably to a\r\nspecial Flora, unless the differences can be ascribed to a diversity\r\nof station.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the different members of the Eocene formation, properly so\r\ncalled, of the Paris basin, I comprehend in this Flora the fossils of\r\nthe same formation in England, at the Isle of Wight, and Isle of\r\nSheppey in the London basin. These latter fossils, consisting almost\r\nsolely of fruits transformed into pyrites, constitute a whole which\r\nhas no analogue in any other of the Tertiary basins of Europe; not\r\nonly in the number and diversity of these fruits, but in their\r\npeculiar characters, which remove them widely from the plants whose\r\nleaves occur in the other beds of the same geological epoch.\r\nEverything, therefore, would lead us to suppose that these fruits,\r\nalthough belonging to plants cotemporaneous with the Eocene deposits\r\nof Europe, have been brought from distant countries by marine\r\ncurrents, just as fruits are still brought from the equatorial regions\r\nof America to the coasts of Ireland or Norway by the great current of\r\nthe Atlantic. The deposit in the Isle of Sheppey appears therefore to\r\nbe an accidental case in the Eocene deposits, and the Paris basin\r\npresents none of these fossils.\r\n\r\n\"The Tertiary basin of Belgium, which follows that of London, has\r\nyielded, near Brussels, some fossil fruits in very small numbers, but\r\nwhich appear identical with one of the genera most abundant at\r\nSheppey. This is the _Nipadites_, considered at first as a species of\r\nCoco, under the name of _Cocus burtini_.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, following the advice of my learned associate, M. Elie de\r\nBeaumont, I have included in the same Flora the plants contained in\r\nthe Lignites of the shores of the Baltic and Pomerania, so rich in\r\namber, in which these vegetables have often been preserved. It is to\r\nthe labours of M. Goeppert that we are indebted for a knowledge of\r\nthese vegetables, most frequently represented by very small fragments,\r\nthe relations of which he has determined with much skill and\r\naccuracy.\"\r\n\r\nWith materials collected in these various localities, but of which the\r\ngreater part are still unpublished, we may construct the Flora of the\r\nEocene epoch; but the list, comprehending only the species described,\r\nor at least determined, is only a mere sketch.\r\n\r\nM. Brongniart then gives the names of the vegetables belonging to the\r\nEocene epoch; these are, for the Amphigenous cryptogams, algæ, and\r\nmushrooms; for the Acrogenous cryptogams, hepatici, mosses, ferns,\r\nequisetaceæ, and characeæ. The Monocotyledons present Naiades,\r\nNipaceæ, and palms. The Gymnospermous dicotyledons are represented by\r\nConiferæ (Cupressinæ, Abietineæ, Taxineæ, and Gnetaceæ.) Lastly, among\r\nthe Angiospermous dicotyledons, we find examples of Betulaceæ,\r\nCupuliferæ, Juglandeæ, Ulmaceæ, Proteaceæ, Leguminosæ, OEnothereæ,\r\nCucurbitaceæ, Sapindaceæ, Malvaceæ, Ericaceæ, and three doubtful\r\nfamilies (Phyllites, Antholithes, and Carpolithes.)\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable characters of this Flora are,--\r\n\r\n\"1_st_, The great quantity of Algæ and marine Naiades, characters\r\nowing to the extent and thickness of the marine formations of this\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\n\"2_d_, The great number of Coniferæ, the greater part belonging to\r\ngenera still existing, but among which the Cupressineæ appear to\r\npredominate, especially if we admit as positively belonging to this\r\nfamily the various fruits of the Isle of Sheppey, which M. Bowerbank\r\nhas described under the name of Cupressinites, and of which M.\r\nEndlicher has formed the genera Callitrites, Frenelites, and\r\nSolenostrobus. If these fruits really belong to European vegetation,\r\nthey indicate very peculiar generic forms, probably now wholly\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\n\"3_d_, The existence of many large species of palm, equally shewn by\r\nthe occurrence of their leaves and stems.\r\n\r\n\"2. _Miocene Epoch._--This Eocene or middle epoch of the Tertiary\r\nformations appears to me to comprehend the following localities among\r\nthose which have furnished materials for the study of the vegetation\r\nof the Tertiary period: 1_st_, In the environs of Paris, the superior\r\nsandstones, or those of Fontainebleau and the _Meulieres_, or\r\nBuhrstone, which crown our coasts; 2_d_, The sandstone, with\r\nimpressions, in the environs of Mans and Angers, and probably those of\r\nBergerac, in the department of the Dordogne; 3_d_, A part of the\r\nTertiary formations of Auvergne, and particularly those of the\r\nmountain Gergovia, formations which, by their impressions, appear more\r\nancient than those of Menat, but which perhaps all belong to different\r\nstages of the Pliocene epoch; 4_th_, The fresh-water formations of\r\nArmissan, near Narbonne, the Gypsum of Aix in Provence, the Lignites\r\nof Provence, whose vegetable fossils are scarcely known; finally, the\r\nLacustrine formations, rich in the wood of palms, and in stems of\r\nMonocotyledons, from Upper Provence, near Apt and Castellane; 5_th_, A\r\npart of the Tertiary formations of Italy, and particularly those of\r\nSuperga, near Turin; 6_th_, The Mollasse of Switzerland, with its\r\nLignites, at Lausanne, Koepfnac, and Horgen, containing the remains of\r\npalms; 7_th_, The Lignites of the banks of the Rhine near Cologne and\r\nBonn, at Friesborf, Liblar, &c., sometimes enclosing wood of palms,\r\nand those of Wetteravia at Nidda, near Frankfort, and other places; as\r\nwell as those of Weisner near Cassel, which all appear to be of the\r\nsame epoch, although those of Wetteravia, by the abundance of certain\r\ngenera of Dicotyledons, such as _juglans_ and _acer_, and even by many\r\ncases of specific identity, seem to make a nearer approach to the\r\nPliocene flora; 8_th_, A part of the Lignites of Bohemia, and\r\nparticularly those of Altsattel, whose fossils, described by M. de\r\nSternberg and M. Rossmæssler, generally agree with those of the other\r\nlocalities already mentioned. The other Lignites of Bohemia, those of\r\nBilin and of Comothau in particular, enter completely into the\r\nPliocene flora; 9_th_, Hoerring in the Tyrol, and Radoboj in Croatia,\r\nof which M. Unger has so well described the numerous impressions in\r\nhis _Chloris Protogæa_, and which have almost become the type of the\r\nMiocene flora.\r\n\r\n\"With the exception of the Lignite formations of the neighbourhood of\r\nCassel and Frankfort--the species of which have often numerous points\r\nof connection with those of OEningen and Parschlug, and which enter\r\nrather into the Pliocene flora--the different localities I have\r\nmentioned have numerous relations between them as to their fossil\r\nvegetables. Thus, the Nymphea Arethusæ is found in the _Meulières_ or\r\nBuhrstone of Paris, and in the marls of Armissan; the Flabellaria\r\nrhapifolia and maxima recur at Hoering in the Tyrol, at Radoboj in\r\nCroatia, and in the superior sandstones of the environs of Angers and\r\nPerigneux.\r\n\r\n\"The Callitrites Brongniartii, Endl., is likewise met with in the\r\nformations of Armissan, Aix, in Provence, at Hoering and Radoboj.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, the Steinhauera globosa of the Altsattel Lignites in Bohemia,\r\nis likewise found in the sandstone of the vicinity of Maus; and the\r\nPlatanus Hercules of Radoboj, in Croatia, has been sent to me from\r\nArmissan, near Narbonne, by M. Toumal.\r\n\r\n\"These facts would probably multiply by a more attentive study of the\r\ndifferent localities; but as it is, they leave little doubt as to the\r\nsynchronism of the greater part of these local formations.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Flora of the Miocene formations, Amphigenous cryptogams occur,\r\nrepresented by Algæ and mushrooms; Acrogenous cryptogams, represented\r\nby mosses, ferns, and Characeæ; Monocotyledons, among which we find\r\nNaiades, Gramineæ, Liliaceæ, and Palms; of the Gymnospermous\r\ndicotyledons, Coniferæ; and Angiospermous dicotyledons, among which\r\noccur Myriceæ, Betulineæ, Cupuliferæ, Ulmaceæ, Moreæ, Plataneæ,\r\nSalicineæ, Lawrineæ, Umbelliferæ, Karolangeæ, Combretaceæ,\r\nCalycantheæ, Leguminosæ, Anacardiæ, Xanthoxyleæ, Juglandeæ, Rhamneæ,\r\nAcerineæ, Nympheaceæ, Apocyneæ, and Rubiaceæ.\r\n\r\n\"The most striking characters of this epoch consist of the mixture of\r\nexotic forms at present peculiar to regions warmer than Europe, with\r\nvegetables growing generally in temperate countries; such as the\r\npalms, a species of bamboo, Lawrineæ, Combretaceæ, Leguminosæ of warm\r\ncountries, Apocyneæ, analogous, according to M. Unger, to the genera\r\nof equatorial regions, a Rubiaceæ altogether tropical, united with\r\n_erables_, walnuts, birches, elms, oaks, _charmes_, &c., genera proper\r\nto temperate or cold regions. The presence of equatorial forms, and\r\nparticularly of palms, appears to distinguish this epoch essentially\r\nfrom the following one. Lastly, we likewise observe the very small\r\nnumber of vegetables with a monopetalous corolla, limited to species\r\nreferred to the family of Apocyneæ by Unger, and to the genus\r\nSteinhauera, founded on a fruit which has much relation to that of\r\nNauclea among the Rubiaceæ.\r\n\r\n\"3. _Pliocene Epoch._--This epoch, embracing all the Tertiary\r\nformations superior to the _fahluns_ of Touraine, comprehends pretty\r\nnumerous localities rich in fossil vegetables, and whose position in\r\nthese formations is determined as much by the _ensemble_ of the\r\nvegetables they contain, as by their other geological characters. The\r\nTertiary basins which, it appears to me, must serve as the basis of\r\nthis Flora, both by their identity, and the numerous and\r\ncarefully-studied vegetables they contain, are: 1st, That of OEningen,\r\nnear Shaffouse, the species of which have been long since studied and\r\nwell determined by M. Alex. Braun, whose work, though unpublished, has\r\nbeen communicated to many naturalists, and particularly to M.\r\nUnger.[44] 2_d_, That of Parschlug, in Styria, the numerous\r\nimpressions of which M. Unger has collected, studied, and determined,\r\npartly published by him in his _Chloris Protogæa_, and presented\r\naltogether in a special enumeration of these species recently\r\npublished under the title of _Flora of Parschlug_. In this locality\r\nalone, M. Unger has recognised and classified 140 different species;\r\nit is the most numerous local Flora with which we are acquainted, and\r\nthe identity of a great number of species with those of OEningen,\r\nindicates well the synchronism of these two local formations. Such\r\nother points in Styria appear likewise to be of the same epoch, as\r\nwell as many localities in Hungary so rich in silicified wood. In\r\nBohemia, the tripoli slates of Bilin and Comothau, which contain a\r\npretty considerable number of plants described by M. de Sternberg, are\r\nno doubt referrible to this epoch, according to the nature of these\r\nplants. Lastly, the Tertiary hills, called the sub-appennine hills of\r\nPlaisantin, of Tuscany, and a part of Piedmont, as well as the\r\ngypseous formation of Stradella, near Pavia, so rich in impressions of\r\nleaves, form part of this epoch; but, with the exception of this\r\nlatter point, these formations contain, in general, few vegetables.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 44: The following interesting observations on the\r\n     OEningen formation are by Professor Agassiz, who refers it to the\r\n     Miocene not to the Pliocene class:--\r\n\r\n     \"This picture would be incomplete did I not institute a farther\r\n     comparison between the present vegetation of those regions and\r\n     the fossil plants of modern geological epochs. If we compare,\r\n     namely, the Tertiary fossil plants of Europe with those living on\r\n     the spot now, we shall be struck with the differences of about\r\n     the same value as those already mentioned between the eastern and\r\n     western coasts of the continents under the same latitudes.\r\n     Compare, for instance, a list of the fossil trees and shrubs from\r\n     OEningen, with a catalogue of trees and shrubs of the eastern and\r\n     western coasts, both of Europe, Asia, and North America, and it\r\n     will be seen that the differences they exhibit scarcely go beyond\r\n     those shewn by these different Floræ under the same latitudes.\r\n     But what is quite extraordinary and unexpected is the fact, that\r\n     the European fossil plants of that locality resemble more closely\r\n     the trees and shrubs which grow at present in the eastern parts\r\n     of North America, than those of any other part of the world;\r\n     thus, allowing us to express correctly the differences already\r\n     mentioned between the vegetation of the eastern and western\r\n     coasts of the continents, by saying that the present eastern\r\n     American flora, and I may add, the fauna also,[A] and probably\r\n     also that of eastern Asia, have a _more ancient character_ than\r\n     those of Europe and of western North America. The plants,\r\n     especially the trees and shrubs growing in our days in this\r\n     country and in Japan, are, as it were, old fashioned; they bear\r\n     the mark of former ages--a peculiarity which agrees with the\r\n     general aspect of North America; the geological structure of\r\n     which indicates that this region was a large continent long\r\n     before the extensive tracts of land had been lifted above the\r\n     level of the sea in any other part of the world.\r\n\r\n     \"The extraordinary analogy which exists between the present Flora\r\n     and Fauna of North America, and the fossils of the Miocene period\r\n     in Europe, would also give a valuable hint with respect to the\r\n     mean annual temperature of that geological period.\r\n\r\n     \"_OEningen_, for instance, whose fossils of all classes have\r\n     perhaps been more fully studied than those of any other locality,\r\n     could not have enjoyed, during that period, a tropical or even a\r\n     subtropical climate, such as has often been assigned to it, if we\r\n     can at all rely upon the indications of its Flora; for this is so\r\n     similar to that of Charleston, South Carolina, that the highest\r\n     mean annual temperature we can ascribe to the Miocene epoch in\r\n     central Europe must be reduced to about 60° Fah.; that is to say,\r\n     we infer from its fossil vegetation that OEningen had, during the\r\n     Tertiary times, the climate of the warm temperate zone, the\r\n     climate of Rome, for instance, and not even that of the northern\r\n     shores of Africa. We are led to this conclusion by the following\r\n     argument:--The same isothermal line which passes at present\r\n     through OEningen, at the 47th degree of northern latitude, passes\r\n     also through Boston, lat. 42°. Supposing now (as the geological\r\n     structure of the two continents and the form of their respective\r\n     outlines at that period seem to indicate), that the undulations\r\n     of the isothermal lines which we notice in our days existed\r\n     already during the Tertiary period, or, in other words, that the\r\n     differences of temperature which exist between the western shores\r\n     of Europe and the eastern shores of North America, were the same\r\n     at that time as now, we shall obtain the mean annual temperature\r\n     of that age by adding simply the difference of mean annual\r\n     temperature which exists between Charleston and Boston (12° Fah.)\r\n     to that of OEningen, which is 48° Fah., as modern OEningen agrees\r\n     almost precisely with Boston, making it 60° Fah.; far from\r\n     looking to the northern shores of Africa for an analogy, which\r\n     the different character of the respective vegetations would\r\n     render still less striking. The mean annual temperature of\r\n     OEningen, during the Tertiary period, would not therefore differ\r\n     more from its present mean than that of Charleston differs from\r\n     that of Boston.\"--_Agassiz_, _on Lake Superior_, p. 150.\r\n\r\n          Footnote A: The characteristic genera Lagomys, Cheldyra, and\r\n          the large Salamanders with permanent gills, remind us of the\r\n          fossils of OEningen, for the present fauna of Japan, as well\r\n          as the Liquidambar, Carya, Taxodium, Gleditschia, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\"In France, the Pliocene epoch probably comprehends a part of the\r\nfresh-water deposits of Auvergne and Ardêche. Thus, the slates of\r\nMenat and those of Rochesauve appear to me to furnish a Flora very\r\nsimilar to those of OEningen and Parschlug. With regard to the marls\r\nof Gergovia and Merdogne, near Clermont, I think they ought rather to\r\nbe classed in the Miocene epoch; but this question can be settled only\r\nby a more attentive determination of the species. The Flora, which\r\nrecapitulates all that has been described or named in these\r\nformations, is, however, essentially founded, as may be seen by the\r\nindication of localities, on the two basins of Parschlug and OEningen.\r\n\r\n\"The Flora of the Pliocene formations is constituted by Amphigenous\r\ncryptogams, comprehending algæ and mushrooms; by Acrogenous\r\ncryptogams, including a muscite, ferns, lycopodiaceæ, and equisitaceæ;\r\nby Monocotyledons, naiades, gramineæ, cyperaceæ, and liliaceæ; by\r\nGymnospermous dicotyledons, coniferæ, represented by cupriessineæ,\r\nabietineæ, and taxineæ; finally, by Angiospermous dicotyledons,\r\ncomprehending myriceæ, betulaceæ, cupuliferæ, ulmaceæ, balsamifluæ,\r\nsalicineæ, laurineæ, thymaleæ, santalaceæ, corneæ, myrtaceæ,\r\ncalycantheæ, pomaceæ, rosaceæ, amygdaleæ, leguminosæ, anacardeæ,\r\njuglandeæ, rhamneæ, celastrineæ, sapindaceæ, acerineæ, tiliaceæ,\r\nmagnoliaceæ, capparideæ, sapoteæ, styraceæ, oleaceæ, ebenaceæ,\r\nilicineæ, and ericaceæ.\r\n\r\n\"The Pliocene epoch, considered in relation to Europe, for I have\r\nintentionally excluded from the preceding list some fossils of the\r\nAntilles referred to these formations, offers as peculiar characters\r\nan extreme analogy to the existing Flora of the temperate regions of\r\nthe northern hemisphere; I do not say of Europe, for this Pliocene\r\nflora comprehends many genera strangers in the present time to Europe,\r\nbut proper to the vegetation of America or temperate Asia. Such are,\r\nif we admit the accuracy of the generic relations established by the\r\nbotanists to whom these determinations are owing, taxodium,\r\nsalisburia, comptonia, liquidambar, nyssa, robinia, gleditschia,\r\nbauhinia, cassia, acacia, rhus, juglans, ceanothus, celastrus,\r\nsapindus, liriodendron, capparis, sideroxylon, achras, and symplocos,\r\nall genera foreign to temperate Europe, but in which they have been\r\nfound in a fossil state, but which, for the most part, still occur in\r\nthe temperate regions of other parts of the globe.\r\n\r\n\"As to other genera still existing in Europe, but which contain only a\r\nsmall number of species, we find many more of them in a fossil state;\r\nsuch are the _Erables_, of which 14 species are enumerated in this\r\nFlora of the Pliocene epoch, and the Oaks, which are 13 in number. It\r\nought to be remarked, that these species come from two or three very\r\ncircumscribed localities which, in the present time, probably would\r\nnot furnish, in a circuit of many leagues, more than three or four\r\nspecies of these genera. Lastly, another character, which I have\r\nalready spoken of, and which makes this Flora to differ still further\r\nfrom that of our epoch, is the absence, or at least the small number\r\nand nature of the plants with Gamopetalous corollas.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, there are only twenty plants of this Flora arranged in the\r\nfamilies of this division, and all are referrible to this group of\r\nHypogynous gamopetales, which I have distinguished by the name of\r\nIsogynes; in the general organization of the flowers, they approach\r\nnearest to the dialypetales.\r\n\r\n\"Is this absence of Anisogynous gamopetales, and with irregular\r\novaries, the result of chance; or does it arise from this, that many\r\nof these plants, particularly among the species of temperate regions,\r\nare herbaceous, and that herbaceous plants are generally in conditions\r\nless favourable for passing into a fossil state? Or, lastly, did those\r\nfamilies, which some botanists have been led to consider the most\r\nelevated in organization, not yet exist? These are points which cannot\r\nbe positively determined in the present state of our knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"We may however remark, that at the Miocene epoch, these plants were\r\nstill less numerous, but belonging to other families; and that at the\r\nEocene period, no one is mentioned by the authors who have shewn the\r\nconnection between the fossil and living plants, without having any\r\npreconceived idea on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Another fact to be noticed, but which likewise probably depends on\r\nthe herbaceous nature of these vegetables, and their leaves not being\r\nshed, is the almost complete absence of Monocotyledons, ferns, and\r\nmosses, which establishes, in regard to these families, a very great\r\ndifference between the Pliocene flora and that of modern Europe.\r\n\r\n\"A difference not less important distinguishes this Flora from that of\r\nthe most ancient epochs; namely, the absence, in all these formations,\r\nof the family of Ferns, which, on the contrary, furnishes so prominent\r\na feature in the Miocene epoch. No trace of them occur in Europe in\r\nthe Pliocene formations I have enumerated; while the woods of this\r\nfamily are very abundant in the formations of the West Indies, which\r\nis considered as an epoch at least as recent as the Pliocene\r\nformation, which appears to indicate that at this period the zones of\r\nvegetation were distributed nearly as at present.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, in these modern formations of the Antilles, we find among the\r\nfossil woods, the only portions of their vegetables that have hitherto\r\nbeen collected, specimens which indicate the existence, not only of\r\nnumerous and varied palms, but of many other families of the\r\nequatorial zone, such as Lianes, nearly related to Bauhinia and\r\nMenispermeæ, Pisonia, &c. The vegetation of the Antilles had therefore\r\nat this period the characters of the equatorial zone, as in Europe it\r\nhad then the characters of the temperate zone.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, and to terminate our observations on this Flora of the latter\r\ngeological epoch which preceded the present one, we would remark that,\r\nnotwithstanding the general analogies which exist between the\r\nvegetables of these formations and those now living in the temperate\r\nregions, no species appears to be identical, at least with the plants\r\nthat still grow in Europe; and if, in some rare cases, complete\r\nidentity appears to exist, it is between these vegetables and American\r\nspecies. Thus the Flora of Europe, even at the most recent geological\r\nepoch, was very different from the European Flora of the present\r\nday.\"--_L'Institut._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Glacial Theory of the Erratics and Drift of the New\r\n                        and Old Worlds_.[45]\r\n                      By Professor L.

Without\r\nbeing taxed with partiality, I may, at the outset, insist upon this\r\ndifference in the part taken by the two contending parties. For, since\r\nthe publication of Sefstroem's paper upon the drift of Sweden, in\r\nwhich very valuable information is given respecting the phenomena\r\nobserved in that peninsula, and the additional data furnished by De\r\nVerneuil and Murchison upon the same country and the plains of Russia,\r\nthe classical ground for erratic phenomena has been left almost\r\nuntouched by all except the advocates of the glacial theory. I need\r\nonly refer to the investigations of M. de Charpentier, Escher, Von\r\nDerlinth and Studer, and more particularly to those extensive and most\r\nminute researches of Professor Guyot in Switzerland, without speaking\r\nof my own and some contributions from visitors,--as the Martins, James\r\nForbes, and others, to justify my assertion, that no important fact,\r\nrespecting the loose materials spread all over Switzerland, has been\r\nadded by the advocates of currents since the days of Sanssure, De Luc,\r\nEscher and Von Buch; whilst Professor Guyot has most conclusively\r\nshewn that the different erratic basins in Switzerland are not only\r\ndistinct from each other, as was already known before, but that in\r\neach the loose materials are arranged in well-determined regular\r\norder, shewing precise relations to the centres of distribution, from\r\nwhich these materials originated; an arrangement which agrees in every\r\nparticular with the arrangement of loose fragments upon the surface of\r\nany glacier, but which no cause acting convulsively could have\r\nproduced.[46]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 46: A comparison of the maps, shewing the arrangement of\r\n     the moraines upon the glacier of the Aar, in my _Système\r\n     Glaciaire_, with the maps which Professor Guyot is about to\r\n     publish of the distribution of the erratic boulders in\r\n     Switzerland, will shew more fully the identity of the two\r\n     phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe results of these investigations are plainly that the boulders\r\nfound at a distance from the Central Alps, originated from their\r\nhigher summits and valleys, and were carried down at different\r\nsuccessive periods in a regular manner, forming uninterrupted walls\r\nand ridges, which can be traced from their starting-point to their\r\nextreme peripheric distribution.\r\n\r\nI have myself shewn that there are such centres of distribution in\r\nScotland, and England, and Ireland; and these facts have been since\r\ntraced in detail in various parts of the British islands by Dr\r\nBuckland, Sir Charles Lyell, Mr Darwin, Mr M'Laren, and Professor\r\nJames Forbes, pointing clearly to the main mountain groups as to so\r\nmany distinct centres of dispersion of these loose materials.\r\n\r\nSimilar phenomena have been shewn in the Pyrenees, in the Black\r\nForest, and in the Vosges, shewing beyond question, that whatever\r\nmight have been the cause of the dispersion of erratic boulders, there\r\nare several separate centres of their distribution to be distinguished\r\nin Europe. But there is another question connected with this local\r\ndistribution of boulders which requires particular investigation, the\r\nconfusion of which with the former has no doubt greatly contributed to\r\nretard our real progress in understanding the general question of the\r\ndistribution of erratics.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Northern Europe is strewed with boulders,\r\nextending over European Russia, Poland, Northern Germany, Holland, and\r\nBelgium. The origin of these boulders is far north in Norway, Sweden,\r\nLapland, and Liefland; but they are now diffused over the extensive\r\nplains west of the Ural Mountains. Their arrangement, however, is such\r\nthat they cannot be referred to one single point of origin, but only\r\nin a general way to the northern tracts of land which rise above the\r\nlevel of the sea in the arctic regions. Whether these boulders were\r\ntransported by the same agency as those arising from distinct centres,\r\non the main Continent of Europe, has been the chief point of\r\ndiscussion. For my own part, I have indeed no doubt that the extreme\r\nconsequences to which we are naturally carried by admitting that ice\r\nwas also the agent in transporting the northern erratics to their\r\npresent positions, has been the chief objection to the view, that the\r\nAlpine boulders have been distributed by glaciers.\r\n\r\nIt seemed easier to account for the distribution of the northern\r\nerratics by currents; and this view appearing satisfactory to those\r\nwho supported it, they at once went further, and opposed the glacial\r\ntheory even in those districts where the glaciers seemed to give a\r\nmore natural and more satisfactory explanation of the phenomena. To\r\nembrace the whole question it should be ascertained:\r\n\r\n_First_, Whether the northern erratics were transported at the same\r\ntime as the local alpine boulders, and if not, which of the phenomena\r\npreceded the other; and again, if the same cause acted in both cases,\r\nor if one of the causes can be applied to one series of these\r\nphenomena, and the other cause to the other series. An investigation\r\nof the erratic phenomena in North America seems to me likely to settle\r\nthis question, as the northern erratics occur here in an undisturbed\r\ncontinuation over tracts of land far more extensive than those in\r\nwhich they have been observed in Europe. For my own part, I have\r\nalready traced them from the eastern shores of Nova Scotia, through\r\nNew England and the north-western States of North America and the\r\nCanadas as far as the western extremity of Lake Superior, a region\r\nembracing about thirty degrees of longitude. Here, as in Northern\r\nEurope, the boulders evidently originated farther north than their\r\npresent location, and have been moved universally in a main direction\r\nfrom south to north.\r\n\r\nFrom data which are, however, rather incomplete, it can be further\r\nadmitted that similar phenomena occur further west across the whole\r\ncontinent, everywhere presenting the same relations. That is to say,\r\neverywhere pointing to the north as to the region of the boulders,\r\nwhich generally disappear about latitude 38°.\r\n\r\nWithout entering at present into a full discussion of any theoretical\r\nviews of the subject, it is plain that any theory, to be satisfactory,\r\nshould embrace both the extensive northern phenomena in Europe and\r\nNorth America, and settle the relation of these phenomena to the\r\nwell-authenticated local phenomena of Central Europe.\r\n\r\nWhether America itself has its special local circumscribed centres of\r\ndistribution or not, remains to be seen. It seems, however, from a few\r\nfacts observed in the White Mountains, that this chain, as well\r\nas the mountains of north-eastern New York, have not been\r\nexclusively,--and for the whole duration of the transportation of\r\nthese materials,--under the influence of the cause which has\r\ndistributed the erratics through such wide space over the continent of\r\nNorth America. But, whether this be the case or not (and I trust local\r\ninvestigations will soon settle the question), I maintain that the\r\ncause which has transported these boulders in the American continent,\r\nmust have acted simultaneously over the whole ground which these\r\nboulders cover, as they present throughout the continent an\r\nuninterrupted sheet of loose materials, of the same general nature,\r\nconnected in the same general manner, and evidently dispersed at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is no ground, at present, to doubt the simultaneous\r\ndispersion of the erratics over Northern Europe and Northern America.\r\nSo that the cause which transported them, whatever it may be, must\r\nhave acted simultaneously over the whole tract of land west of the\r\nUral Mountains, and east of the Rocky Mountains, without assuming\r\nanything respecting Northern Asia, which has not yet been studied in\r\nthis respect; that is to say, at the same time, over a space embracing\r\ntwo hundred degrees of longitude.\r\n\r\nAgain, the action of this cause must have been such, and I insist\r\nstrongly upon this point, as a fundamental one, the momentum with\r\nwhich it acted must have been such, that after being set in motion in\r\nthe north, with a power sufficient to carry the large boulders which\r\nare found everywhere over this vast extent of land, it vanished, or\r\nwas stopped, after reaching _the thirty-fifth degree of northern\r\nlatitude_.\r\n\r\nNow it is my deliberate opinion that natural philosophy and\r\nmathematics may settle the question, whether a body of water of\r\nsufficient extent to produce such phenomena can be set in motion with\r\nsufficient velocity to move all these boulders; and nevertheless stop\r\nbefore having swept over the whole surface of the globe. Hydrographers\r\nare familiar with the action of currents, with their speed, and with\r\nthe power with which they can act. They know also how they are\r\ndistributed over the globe. And, if we institute a comparison, it will\r\nbe seen that there is nowhere a current running from the poles towards\r\nthe lower latitudes, either in the northern or southern hemisphere,\r\ncovering a space equal to one-tenth of the currents which should have\r\nexisted to carry the erratics into their present position. The widest\r\ncurrent is west of the Pacific, which runs parallel to the equator,\r\nacross the whole extent of that sea from east to west, and the\r\ngreatest width of which is scarcely fifty degrees. This current, as a\r\nmatter of course, establishes a regular rotation between the waters\r\nflowing from the polar regions towards lower latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream, on the contrary, runs from west to east, and dies out\r\ntowards Europe and Africa, and is compensated by the currents from\r\nBaffin's Bay and Spitzbergen emptying into the Atlantic, while the\r\ncurrent of the Pacific, moving towards Asia, and carrying floods of\r\nwater in that direction, is maintained chiefly by antarctic currents,\r\nand those which follow the western shore of America from Behring's\r\nStraits. Wherever they are limited by continents, we see that the\r\nwaters of these currents, even when they extend over hundreds of\r\ndegrees of latitude, as the Gulf Stream does in its whole course, are\r\ndeflected where they cannot follow a straight course.\r\n\r\nNow, without appealing with more detail to the mechanical conditions\r\ninvolved in this inquiry, I ask every unprejudiced mind acquainted\r\nwith the distribution of the northern boulders, whether there was any\r\ngeographical limitation to the supposed northern current to cause it\r\nto leave the northern erratics of Europe in such regular order, with a\r\nconstant bearing from north to south, and to form, on its southern\r\ntermination, a wide, regular zone from Asia to the western shores of\r\nEurope, north of the fiftieth degree of latitude, before it had\r\nreached the great barrier of the Alps? I ask, whether there was such a\r\nbarrier in the unlimited plains which stretch from the Arctic seas\r\nuninterrupted over the whole northern continent of America as far down\r\nas the Gulf of Mexico?\r\n\r\nI ask, again, why the erratics are circumscribed within the northern\r\nlimits of the temperate zone, if their transportation is owing to the\r\naction of water currents? Does not, on the contrary, this most\r\nsurprising limit within the arctic and northern temperate zones, and,\r\nin the same manner, within the antarctic and southern temperate zones,\r\ndistinctly shew that the cause of transportation is connected with the\r\ntemperature or climate of the countries over which the phenomena were\r\nproduced? If it were otherwise, why are there no systems of erratics\r\nwith an east and west bearing, or in the main direction of the most\r\nextensive currents flowing at present over the surface of our globe?\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of fact, of undeniable fact, for which the theory has\r\nto account, that, in the two hemispheres, the erratics have direct\r\nreference to the polar regions, and are circumscribed within the\r\narctics and the colder part of the temperate zones. This fact is as\r\nplain as the other fact, that the local distribution of boulders has\r\nreference to high mountain ranges, to groups of land raised above the\r\nlevel of the sea into heights, the temperature of which is lower than\r\nthe surrounding plains. And what is still more astonishing, the extent\r\nof the local boulders, from their centre of distribution, reaches\r\nlevels, the mean annual temperature of which corresponds, in a\r\nsurprising manner, with the mean annual temperature of the southern\r\nlimit of the northern erratics.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, in this agreement, a strong evidence in favour of\r\nthe view that both the phenomena of local mountain erratics in Europe,\r\nand of northern erratics in Europe and America, have probably been\r\nproduced by the same cause.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty is in conceiving the possibility of the formation\r\nof a sheet of ice sufficiently large to carry the northern erratics\r\ninto their present limits of distribution; but this difficulty is\r\ngreatly removed when we can trace, as in the Alps, the progress of the\r\nboulders under the same aspect from the glaciers now existing, down\r\ninto regions where they no longer exist, but where the boulders and\r\nother phenomena attending their transportation shew distinctly that\r\nthey once existed.\r\n\r\nWithout extending further this argumentation, I would call the\r\nattention of the unprejudiced observer to the fact, that those who\r\nadvocate currents as the cause of the transportation of erratics,\r\nhave, up to this day, failed to shew, in a single instance, that\r\ncurrents can produce all the different phenomena connected with the\r\ntransportation of the boulders which are observed everywhere in the\r\nAlps, and which are still daily produced there by the small glaciers\r\nyet in existence. Never do we find that water leaves the boulders\r\nwhich it carries along in regular walls of mixed materials; nor do\r\ncurrents anywhere produce upon the hard rocks _in situ_ the peculiar\r\ngrooves and scratches which we see everywhere under the glacier and\r\nwithin the limits of their ordinary oscillations.\r\n\r\nWater may polish the rocks, but it nowhere leaves straight scratches\r\nupon their surface; it may furrow them, but these furrows are sinuous,\r\nacting more powerfully upon the soft parts of the rocks or fissures\r\nalready existing; whilst glaciers smooth and level uniformly the\r\nhardest parts equally with the softest, and, like a hard file, rub to\r\nuniform continuous surfaces the rocks upon which they move.\r\n\r\nBut now let us return to our special subject, the erratics of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of drift are more complicated about Lake Superior than I\r\nhave seen them anywhere else; for, besides the general phenomena which\r\noccur everywhere, there are some peculiarities noticed which are to be\r\nascribed to the lake as such, and which we do not find in places where\r\nno large sheet of water has been brought into contact with the erratic\r\nphenomena. In the first place, we notice about Lake Superior an\r\nextensive tract of polished, grooved and scratched rocks, which\r\npresent here the same uniform character which they have everywhere. As\r\nthere is so little disposition, among so many otherwise intelligent\r\ngeologists, to perceive the facts as they are, whenever they bear upon\r\nthe question of drift, I cannot but repeat, what I have already\r\nmentioned more than once, but what I have observed again here over a\r\ntract of some fifteen hundred miles, that the rocks are everywhere\r\nsmoothed, rounded, grooved and furrowed in a uniform direction. The\r\nheterogeneous materials of which the rocks consist are cut to one\r\ncontinuous uniform level, shewing plainly that no difference in the\r\npolish and abrasion can be attributed to the greater or less\r\nresistance on the part of the rocks, but that a continuous rush cut\r\ndown everything, adapting itself, however, to the general undulations\r\nof the country, but nevertheless shewing, in this close adaptation, a\r\nmost remarkable continuity in its action.\r\n\r\nThat the power which produced these phenomena moved in the main from\r\nnorth to south, is distinctly shewn by the form of the hills, which\r\npresent abrupt slopes, rough and sharp corners towards the south,\r\nwhile they are all smoothed off towards the north.\r\n\r\nIndeed, here, as in Norway and Sweden, there is on all the hills a\r\nlee-side and a strike-side. As has been observed in Norway and Sweden,\r\nthe polishing is very perfect in many places, sometimes strictly as\r\nbrilliant as a polished metallic surface, and everywhere these\r\nsurfaces are more or less scratched and furrowed, and both scratches\r\nand furrows are rectilinear, crossing each other under various angles;\r\nhowever, never varying many points of the compass on the same spot,\r\nbut in general shewing that where there are deviations from the most\r\nprominent direction, they are influenced by the undulations of the\r\nsoil. It has been said, that the main direction of these striæ was\r\nfrom north-west to south-east, but I have found it as often strictly\r\nfrom north to south, or even from north-east to south-west; and if we\r\nare to express a general result, we should say that the direction,\r\nassigned by all our observations to the various scratches, tends to\r\nshew that they have been formed under the influence of a movement from\r\nnorth to south, varying more or less to the east and west, according\r\nto local influences in the undulations of the soil. It is, indeed, a\r\nvery important fact, that scratches which seem to have been produced\r\nat no great intervals from each other, are not absolutely parallel,\r\nbut may diverge for ten, fifteen, or more degrees. There is one\r\nfeature in these phenomena, however, in which we never observe any\r\nvariation. The continuity of these lines is absolutely the same\r\neverywhere. They are rectilinear and continuous, and cannot be better\r\ncompared than with the effects of stones or other hard materials\r\ndragged in the same direction upon flat or rolling surfaces; they form\r\nsimple scratches extending for yards in straight lines, or breaking\r\noff for a short space to continue again in a straight line in the same\r\ndirection, just as if interrupted by a jerk. There are also deeper\r\nscratches of the same kind, presenting the same phenomena, only,\r\nperhaps, traceable for a greater distance than the finer ones. These\r\nscratches, instead of appearing like the tracing of diamonds upon\r\nglass, as the former do, would rather assume the appearance of a\r\ndeeper groove, made by the point of a graver, or perhaps still more\r\nclosely resemble the scratches which a cart-wheel would produce upon\r\npolished marble, if the wheel were chained, and coarse sand spread\r\nover the floor. The appearance of the rock, crushed by the moving\r\nmass, is especially distinct in limestone rocks, where grooves are\r\nseldom nicely cut, but present the appearance of a violent pressure\r\ncombined with the grooving power, thus giving to the groove a\r\ncharacter which is quite peculiar, and which at once strikes an\r\nobserver who has been familiar with its characteristic aspect. Now, I\r\ndo not know upon what the assertions of some geologists rest, that\r\ngravel, moved by water under strong heavy currents, will produce\r\nsimilar effects. Wherever I have gone since studying these phenomena,\r\nI have looked for such cases, and have never yet found modern gravel\r\ncurrents produce any thing more than a smooth surface, with undulating\r\nfurrows following the cracks in the rocks, or following their softer\r\nparts; but continuous straight lines, especially such crushed lines\r\nand straight furrows, I have never seen.\r\n\r\nWhen we know how extensive the action of water carrying mud and gravel\r\nis on every shore and in every water-current,--when we can trace this\r\naction almost everywhere, and nowhere find it similar to the phenomena\r\njust described, I cannot imagine upon what ground these phenomena are\r\nstill attributed to the agency of currents. This is the less rational\r\nas we have at present, in all high mountain chains of the temperate\r\nzone, other agents, the glaciers, producing these very same phenomena,\r\nwith precisely the same characters, to which therefore a sound\r\nphilosophy should ascribe, at least conditionally, the northern and\r\nalpine polished surfaces, and scratched and grooved rocks, or at least\r\nacknowledge that the effect produced by the action of glaciers more\r\nnearly resembles these erratic phenomena than does that which results\r\nfrom the action of currents. But such is the prejudice of many\r\ngeologists, that those keen faculties of distinction and\r\ngeneralization, that power of superior perception and discrimination,\r\nwhich have led them to make such brilliant discoveries in geology in\r\ngeneral, seem to abandon them at once as soon as they look at the\r\nerratics. The objection made by a venerable geologist, that the cold\r\nrequired to form and preserve such glaciers, for any length of time,\r\nwould freeze him to death, is as childish as the apprehension that the\r\nheavy ocean-currents, the action of which he sees everywhere, might\r\nhave swept him away.[47]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 47: Berlin Academy, 1846.\r\n\r\nNow that these phenomena have been observed extensively, we may derive\r\nalso some instruction from the limits of their geographical extent.\r\nLet us see, therefore, where these polished, scratched, and furrowed\r\nrocks have been observed.\r\n\r\nIn the first place they occur everywhere in the north within certain\r\nlimits of the arctics, and through the colder parts of the temperate\r\nzone. They occur also in the southern hemisphere, within parallel\r\nlimits, but in the plains of the tropics, and even in the warmer parts\r\nof the temperate zone we find no trace of these phenomena, and\r\nnevertheless the action of currents could not be less there, and could\r\nnot at any time have been less there than in the colder climates. It\r\nis true, similar phenomena occur in Central Europe, and have been\r\nnoticed in Central Asia, and even in the Andes of South America, but\r\nthese always in higher regions, at definite levels above the surface\r\nof the sea, everywhere indicating a connection between their extent\r\nand the colder temperature of the places over which they are traced.\r\n\r\nMore recently, a step towards the views I entertain of this subject\r\nhas been made by those geologists who would ascribe them to the agency\r\nof icebergs. Here, as in my glacial theory, ice is made the agent;\r\nfloating ice is supposed to have ground and polished the surfaces of\r\nrocks, while I consider them to have been acted upon by terrestrial\r\nglaciers. To settle this difference we have a test which is as\r\nirresistible as the other arguments already introduced.\r\n\r\nLet us investigate the mode of action, the mode of transportation of\r\nicebergs, and let us examine whether this cause is adequate to produce\r\nphenomena for which it is made to account. As mentioned above, the\r\npolished surfaces are continuous over hills, and in depressions of the\r\nsoil, and the scratches which run over such undulating surfaces are\r\nnevertheless continuous in straight lines. If we imagine icebergs\r\nmoving upon shoals, no doubt they would scratch and polish the rocks\r\nin a way similar to moving glaciers. But upon such grounds they would\r\nsooner or later be stranded; and if they remained loose enough to\r\nmove, they would, in their gyratory movements, produce curved lines,\r\nand mark the spots where they had been stranded with particular\r\nindications of their prolonged action. But nowhere upon arctic ground\r\ndo we find such indications. Everywhere the polished and scratched\r\nsurfaces are continuous in straight juxtaposition.\r\n\r\nPhenomena analogous to those produced by icebergs would only be seen\r\nalong the sea-shores; and if the theory of drifted icebergs were\r\ncorrect, we should have, all over those continents where erratic\r\nphenomena occur, indications of retreating shores as far as the\r\nerratic phenomena are found. But there is no such thing to be observed\r\nover the whole extent of the North American continent, nor over\r\nNorthern Europe and Asia, as far as the northern erratics extend. From\r\nthe arctics to the southernmost limit of the erratic distribution, we\r\nfind nowhere the indications of the action of the sea as directly\r\nconnected with the production of the erratic phenomena. And wherever\r\nthe marine deposits rest upon the polished surfaces of ground and\r\nscratched rocks, they can be shewn to be deposits formed since the\r\ngrooving and polishing of the rocks, in consequence of the subsidence\r\nof those tracts of land upon which such deposits occur.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we take for a moment into consideration the immense extent\r\nof land covered by erratic phenomena, and view them as produced by\r\ndrifted icebergs, we must acknowledge that the icebergs of the\r\n_present period_ at least, are insufficient to account for them, as\r\nthey are limited to a narrower zone. And to bring icebergs in any way\r\nwithin the extent which would answer for the extent of the\r\ndistribution of erratics, we must assume that the northern ice-fields,\r\nfrom which these icebergs could be detached and float southwards, were\r\nmuch larger at the time they produced such extensive phenomena than\r\nthey are now. That is to say, we must assume an ice period; and if we\r\nlook into the circumstances, we shall find that this ice period, to\r\nanswer to the phenomena, should be nothing less than an extensive cap\r\nof ice upon both poles. This is the very theory which I advocate; and\r\nunless the advocates of an iceberg-theory go to that length in their\r\npremises, I venture to say, without fear of contradiction, that they\r\nwill find the source of their icebergs fall short of the requisite\r\nconditions which they must assume, upon due consideration, to account\r\nfor the whole phenomena as they have really been observed.\r\n\r\nBut without discussing any farther the theoretical views of the\r\nquestion, let me describe more minutely the facts, as observed on the\r\nnorthern shores of Lake Superior. The polished surfaces, as such, are\r\neven, undulating, and terminate always above the rough lee-side turned\r\nto the south, unless upon gentle declivities, where the polished\r\nsurfaces extend in unbroken continuity upon the southern surfaces of\r\nthe hills, as well as upon their northern slopes. On their eastern and\r\nwestern flanks, shallow valleys running east and west are as uniformly\r\npolished as those which run north and south; and this fact is more and\r\nmore evident, wherever scratches and furrows are also well preserved\r\nand distinctly seen, and by their bearings we can ascertain most\r\nminutely, the direction of the onward movement which produced the\r\nwhole phenomena. Nothing is more striking in this respect than the\r\nvalleys or depressions of the soil running east and west, where we see\r\nthe scratches crossing such undulations at right angles, descending\r\nalong the southern gentle slope of a hill, traversing the flat bottom\r\nbelow, and rising again up the next hill south, in unbroken\r\ncontinuity. Examples of the kind can be seen everywhere in those\r\nnarrow inlets, with shallow waters intersecting the innumerable\r\nhighlands along the northern shores of Lake Superior, where the\r\nscratches and furrows can be traced under water from one shore to the\r\nother, and where they at times ascend steep hills, which they cross at\r\nright angles along their northern slope, even when the southern slope,\r\nnot steeper in itself, faces the south with rough escarpments.\r\n\r\nThe scratches and furrows, though generally running north and south,\r\nand deviating slightly to the east and west, present, in various\r\nplaces, remarkable anomalies, even in their general course along the\r\neastern shore of the lake. Between Michipicotin and Sault St Marie, we\r\nmore frequently see a deflection to the west than a due north and\r\nsouth course, which is rather normal along the northern shore proper,\r\nbetween Michipicotin and other islands, and from the Pic to\r\nFort-William; the deep depression of the lake being no doubt the cause\r\nof such a deviation, as large masses of ice could accumulate in this\r\nextensive hollow cavity before spreading again more uniformly beyond\r\nits limits. To the oscillations of the whole mass in its southerly\r\nmovement, according to the inequalities of the surfaces, we must\r\nascribe the crossing of the straight lines at acute angles, as we\r\nobserve also at the present day under the glaciers, as they swell and\r\nsubside, and hence meet with higher and lower obstacles in their\r\nirregular course between the Alpine valleys.\r\n\r\nIn deep, narrow chasms, however, we find now and then greater\r\ndeviations from the normal direction of the striæ, where considerable\r\nmasses of ice could accumulate, and move between steep walls under a\r\nlateral pressure of the masses moving onwards from the north. Such a\r\nchasm is seen between Spar Island and the main land opposite Prince's\r\nLocation, south of Fort-William, where the furrows and scratches run\r\nnearly east and west. But here also, there is no tumultuous\r\ndisturbance in the continuation of the phenomena, such as would occur\r\nif icebergs were floated and stranded against the southern barrier.\r\nThe same continuity of even, polished surfaces, with their scratches\r\nand furrows, prevails here as elsewhere. The angles which these\r\nscratches form with each other are very acute, generally not exceeding\r\n10°; but at times they diverge more, forming angles of 15°, 20°, and\r\n25°. In a few instances, I have even found localities where they\r\ncrossed each other at angles of no less than 30°; but these are rare\r\nexceptions. It may sometimes be noticed that the lines running in one\r\ndirection form a system by themselves, varying very little from strict\r\nparallelism with each other, but crossing another system, more or less\r\nstrongly marked, of other lines equally parallel with each other. At\r\nother times, a system of lines, strongly marked and diverging very\r\nslightly, seem to pass over another system, in which the lines form\r\nvarious angles with each other. Again, there are places,--and this is\r\nthe most common case, where the lines diverge slightly, following,\r\nhowever, generally one main direction, which is crossed by fewer\r\nlines, forming more open angles. These differences, no doubt, indicate\r\nvarious oscillations in the movement of the mass which produced the\r\nlines, and shew probably its successive action, with more or less\r\nintensity, upon the same point at successive periods, in accordance\r\nwith the direction of the moving force at each interval. The same\r\nvariations within precisely the same limits may be noticed in our day\r\non the margin of the glaciers produced by the increase or diminution\r\nof the bulk of their mass, and the changes on the rate of their\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe loose materials which produced, in their onward movement under the\r\npressure of ice, such polishing and grooving, consisted of\r\nvarious-sized boulders, pebbles, and gravels, down to the most minute\r\nsand and loamy powder. Accumulations of such materials are found\r\neverywhere upon these smooth surfaces, and in their arrangement they\r\npresent everywhere the most striking contrast when compared with\r\ndeposits accumulated under the agency of water. Indeed, we nowhere\r\nfind this glacial drift regularly stratified, being every where\r\nirregular accumulations of loose materials, scattered at random\r\nwithout selection, the coarsest and most minute particles being piled\r\nirregularly in larger or smaller heaps, the greatest boulders standing\r\nsometimes uppermost, or in the centre, or in any position among\r\nsmaller pebbles and impalpable powder.\r\n\r\nAnd these materials themselves are scratched, polished and furrowed,\r\nand the scratches and furrows are rectilinear as upon the rocks _in\r\nsitu_ underneath, not bruised simply, as the loose materials carried\r\nonward by currents or driven against the shores by the tides, but\r\nregularly scratched, as fragments of hard materials would be if they\r\nhad been fastened during their friction against each other, just as we\r\nobserve them upon the lower surface of glaciers where all the loose\r\nmaterials are set in ice, as stones in their setting are pressed and\r\nrubbed against underlying rocks. But the setting here being simply\r\nice, these loose materials, fast at one time and moveable another, and\r\nfixed and loosened again, have rubbed against the rock below in all\r\npossible positions; and hence, not only their rounded form, but also\r\ntheir rectilinear grooving. How such grooves could be produced under\r\nthe action of currents, I leave to the advocates of such a theory to\r\nshew; as soon as they shall be prepared for it.\r\n\r\nI should not omit here to mention a fact which, in my opinion, has a\r\ngreat theoretical importance, namely, that in the northern erratics,\r\neven the largest boulders, as far as I know, are rounded, and\r\nscratched and polished; at least, all those which are found beyond the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the higher mountain ranges, shewing that the\r\naccumulations of ice which moved the northern erratics covered the\r\nwhole country; and this view is sustained by another set of facts\r\nequally important, namely, that the highest ridges, the highest rugged\r\nmountains, at least, in this continent and north of the Alps in\r\nEurope, are as completely polished and smoothed as the lower lands,\r\nand only a very few peaks seem to have risen above the sheet of ice;\r\nwhilst, in the Alps, the summits of the mountains stand generally\r\nabove these accumulations of ice, and have supplied the surface of the\r\nglaciers with large numbers of angular boulders, which have been\r\ncarried upon the back of glaciers to the lower valleys and adjacent\r\nplains without losing their angular forms.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the irregular accumulation of drift-materials in the\r\nnorth, I may add, that there is not only no indication of\r\nstratification among them, such, unquestionably, as water would have\r\nleft, but that the very nature of these materials shews plainly that\r\nthey are of terrestrial origin; for the mud which sticks between them\r\nadheres to all the little roughnesses of the pebbles, fills them out,\r\nand has the peculiar adhesive character of the mud ground under the\r\nglaciers, and differing entirely in that respect from the gravels, and\r\npebbles, and sands washed by water-currents, which leave each pebble\r\nclean, and never form adhering masses, unless penetrated by an\r\ninfiltration of limestone.\r\n\r\nAnother important fact respecting this glacial draft consists in the\r\nuniversal absence of marine, as well as fresh-water fossils in its\r\ninterior--a fact which strengthens the view that they have been\r\naccumulated by the agency of strictly terrestrial glaciers; such is,\r\nat least, the case everywhere far from the sea-shore. But we may\r\nconclude that these ancient glaciers reached, upon various points, the\r\nsea-shore at the time of their greatest extension, just as they do at\r\npresent in Spitzbergen and other arctic shores; and that therefore, in\r\nsuch proximity, phenomena of contact should be observed, indicating\r\nthe onward movement of glacial material into the ocean, such as the\r\naccumulation within these materials of marine fossil remains, and also\r\nthe influence of the tidal movements upon them. And now such is really\r\nthe case. Nearer the sea-shores we observe distinctly, in some\r\naccumulations of the drift, faint indications of the action of the\r\ntide, reaching the lower surface of glaciers, and the remodelling to\r\nsome extent of the materials which these poured into the sea. A\r\nbeautiful example of the kind may be observed near Cambridge, along\r\nCharles River, not far from Mount Auburn, where the unstratified\r\nglacial drift (_a_) presents in its upper masses strictly the\r\ncharacters of true terrestrial glacial accumulation, but shews\r\nunderneath faint indications (_b_) of the action of tides. Above,\r\nregular tidal strata (_c_) are observed, formed probably after the\r\nmasses below had subsided. The surface of this accumulation is covered\r\nwith soil (_d_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sketch of river bank stratification]\r\n\r\nThe period at which these phenomena took place cannot be fully\r\ndetermined, nor is it easy to ascertain whether all glacial drift is\r\ncontemporaneous. It would seem, however, as if the extensive\r\naccumulation of drift all around the northern pole in Europe, Asia,\r\nand America was of the same age as the erratic of the Alps. The\r\nclimatic circumstances capable of accumulating such large masses of\r\nice around the north pole, having no doubt extended their influence\r\nover the temperate zone, and probably produced, in high mountain\r\nchains, as the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Black Forest, and the Vosges,\r\nsuch accumulations of snow and ice as may have produced the erratic\r\nphenomena of those districts. But extensive changes must have taken\r\nplace in the appearance of the continents over which we trace erratic\r\nphenomena, since we observe in the Old World, as well as in North\r\nAmerica, extensive stratified deposits containing fossils which rest\r\nupon the erratics; and as we have all possible good reasons and\r\nsatisfactory evidence for admitting that the erratics were transported\r\nby the agency of terrestrial glaciers, and that, therefore, the tracts\r\nof land over which they occur stood at that time above the level of\r\nthe sea, we are led to the conclusion that these continents have\r\nsubsided since that period below the level of the sea, and that over\r\ntheir inundated portions, animal life has spread, remains of organized\r\nbeings have been accumulated, which are now found in a fossil state in\r\nthe deposits formed under those sheets of water.\r\n\r\nSuch deposits occur at various levels in different parts of North\r\nAmerica. They have been noticed about Montreal, on the shores of Lake\r\nChamplain, in Maine, and also in Sweden and Russia; and what is most\r\nimportant, they are not everywhere at the same absolute level above\r\nthe surface of the ocean, shewing that both the subsidence and the\r\nsubsequent upheaval which has again brought them above the level of\r\nthe sea, have been unequal; and that we should therefore be very\r\ncautious in our inferences respecting both the continental\r\ncircumstances under which the ancient glaciers were formed, and also\r\nthe extent of the sea afterward, as compared with its present limits.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the unstratified drift and the subsequently\r\nstratified deposits is so great, that they rest everywhere\r\nunconformably upon each other, shewing distinctly the difference of\r\nthe agency under which they were accumulated. This unconformable\r\nsuperposition of marine drift upon glacial drift is so beautifully\r\nshewn at the above-mentioned locality near Cambridge (see diagram, p.\r\n114.) In this case the action of tides in the accumulation of the\r\nstratified materials is plainly seen.\r\n\r\nThe various heights at which these stratified deposits occur, above\r\nthe level of the sea, shew plainly, that since their accumulation the\r\nmain land has been lifted above the ocean at different rates in\r\ndifferent parts of the country; and it would be a most important\r\ninvestigation to have their absolute level, in order more fully to\r\nascertain the last changes which our continents have undergone.\r\n\r\nFrom the above mentioned facts, it must be at once obvious that the\r\nvarious kinds of loose materials all over the northern hemisphere,\r\nhave been accumulated, not only under different circumstances, but\r\nduring long-continued subsequent distinct periods, and that great\r\nchanges have taken place since their deposition, before the present\r\nstate of things was fully established.\r\n\r\nTo the first period,--the ice period, as I have called it,--belong all\r\nthe phenomena connected with the transportation of erratic boulders,\r\nthe polishing, scratching, and furrowing of the rocks, and the\r\naccumulation of unstratified, scratched, and loamy drift. During that\r\nperiod the mainland seems to have been, to some extent at least,\r\nhigher above the level of the sea than now; as we observe, on the\r\nshores of Great Britain, Norway, and Sweden, as well as on the eastern\r\nshores of North America, the polished surfaces dipping under the level\r\nof the ocean, which encroaches everywhere upon the erratics proper,\r\neffaces the polished surfaces, and remodels the glacial drift. During\r\nthese periods, large terrestrial animals lived upon both continents,\r\nthe fossil remains of which are found in the drift of Siberia, as well\r\nas of this continent. A fossil elephant, recently discovered in\r\nVermont, adds to the resemblance, already pointed out, between the\r\nnorthern drift of Europe and that of North America; for fossils of\r\nthat genus are now known to occur upon the northern-most point of the\r\nwestern extremity of North America, in New England, in Northern\r\nEurope, as well as all over Siberia.\r\n\r\nTo the second period we would refer the stratified deposits resting\r\nupon drift, which indicate, that during their deposition the northern\r\ncontinent had again extensively subsided under the surface of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, animals, identical with those which occur in the\r\nnorthern seas, spread widely over parts of the globe which are now\r\nagain above the level of the ocean. But, as this last elevation seems\r\nto have been gradual, and is even still going on in our day, there is\r\nno possibility of tracing more precisely, at least for the present,\r\nthe limit between that epoch and the present state of things. Their\r\ncontinuity seems almost demonstrated by the identity of fossil-shells\r\nfound in these stratified deposits, with those now living along the\r\npresent shores of the same continent, and by the fact, that changes in\r\nthe relative level between sea and mainland are still going on in our\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIndications of such relative changes between the level of the waters\r\nand the land are also observed about Lake Superior. And here they\r\nassume a very peculiar character, as the level of the lake itself, in\r\nits relation to its shores, is extensively changed.[48]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 48: An interesting account of the natural terraces\r\n     around Lake Superior is given at p. 413-416 of \"Lake Superior.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Description of the Marine Telescope._\r\n    By JOHN ADIE, F.R.S.E., F.R.S.S.A. Communicated by the Author.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instrument which has been popularly named the Water, or Marine\r\nTelescope, from the power given by its use to see into the water,\r\nconsists of a tube of metal or wood, of a convenient length, to enable\r\na person looking over the gunnel of a boat to rest the head on the one\r\nend, while the other is below the surface of the water; the upper end\r\nis so formed, that the head may rest on it, both eyes seeing freely\r\ninto the tube. Into the lower end is fixed (water-tight) a plate of\r\nglass, which, when used, is to be kept under the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: sketch of marine telescope]\r\n\r\nA very convenient size for the instrument represented in the above\r\nfigure, is to make the length AC, 3 feet, and the mouth A, where the\r\nface is applied, of an irregular oval form, that both eyes may see\r\nfreely into the tube, with an indentation on one side, that the nose\r\nmay breathe freely, not throwing the moisture of the breath into the\r\ntube. B is a round plate of glass, 8 inches diameter, over which is\r\nthe rim or edge C; this rim is best formed of lead, ¼ of an inch\r\nthick, and 3 inches deep; the weight of the lead serves to sink the\r\ntube a little into the water. Holes must be provided at the junction\r\nof B to C, for the purpose of allowing the air to escape, and bring\r\nthe water into contact with the glass; on each side there is a handle\r\nfor holding the instrument. This size and form is very much that of\r\nthe instrument brought from Norway by John Mitchell, Esq., Belgian\r\nConsul, of Mayville, with the improvement for excluding the breath,\r\nand allowing the water to get into contact with the glass, which was\r\nnot provided for in that instrument.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we so seldom see the bottom of the sea, or of a pure\r\nlake, where the depth is not beyond the powers of natural vision, is\r\nnot that the rays of light reflected from the objects at the bottom\r\nare so feeble as to be imperceptible to our sense, from their passage\r\nthrough the denser medium of the water, but from the irregular\r\nrefractions given to the rays in passing out of the water into the\r\nair, caused by the constant ripple or motion of the surface of the\r\nwater, where that refraction takes place. Reflections of light from\r\nthe surface also add to the difficulty; and before we can with any\r\njust hope expect to see the objects distinctly at the bottom, these\r\nobstructions must be removed.\r\n\r\nThis is done to a very great extent by the use of the instrument which\r\nforms the subject of this notice; the tube serves to screen the eyes\r\nfrom reflections, and the water being in contact with the glass plate,\r\nall ripple is got rid of, so that the spectator, looking down the\r\ntube, sees all objects at the bottom, whose reflective powers are able\r\nto send off rays of sufficient intensity to be impressed on the\r\nretina, after suffering the loss of light caused by the absorbing\r\npower of the water, which obeys certain fixed laws, proportionate to\r\nthe depth of water passed through; for as light passing through pure\r\nsea-water loses half its intensity for each 15 feet through which it\r\npasses,[49] we must, from this cause alone, at a certain depth lose\r\nsight of objects of the brightest lustre. The perfect purity of the\r\nwater, and its freedom from all muddy particles floating in it, form\r\nan important element in the effective use of the water-telescope; for\r\nexample, in the Frith of Forth, and similar estuaries, where the\r\ninflux and reflux of the tide keep particles of mud in constant\r\nmotion, the instrument is of little or no use; for these act in\r\nexactly the same way in limiting our vision through water, as a fog\r\ndoes through the air: it is therefore only in the pure waters of our\r\nnorthern and western shores that this contrivance is applied with any\r\nadvantage; and in such situations we can speak of its powers with\r\nconfidence. In a trial made with the instrument last autumn on the\r\nwest coast of Scotland, the bottom was distinctly seen (a white\r\nbottom) at a depth of 12 fathoms; and on a black, rocky bottom, at 5\r\nfathoms under water, objects were so distinctly seen that the parts of\r\na wreck were taken up--the exact place of which was not known previous\r\nto its use. In these experiments a lenticular form of glass was made\r\nuse of at the bottom of the tube, having a plane surface to the water,\r\nbut no great or marked advantage was observable from this\r\nconstruction. With respect to the history of this contrivance for\r\nviewing the bottom of the sea, we are unable to assign any particular\r\ndate: so far as our information goes, it has been in use from a very\r\nremote period. We are informed that it is in general use in\r\nseal-shooting along our northern and western islands, where, sometimes\r\nin the form of an ordinary washing-tub, with a piece of glass fixed in\r\nits bottom, the shot-seal was looked for, and the grappling-hook let\r\ndown to bring him to the surface. It may not be generally known, that\r\nin seal-shooting, the shot or wounded seal always seeks the bottom,\r\nfrom which he never rises after death, till washed ashore by the\r\naction of the sea: it is only when the fatal ball deprives him of the\r\npower of diving that he is ever found at the surface. In such\r\nemployments, therefore, the use of this instrument, however modified,\r\nmust form an important auxiliary to the best rifle. Throwing oil over\r\nthe surface of the water is used in the same pursuits; but this only\r\nso far stills the ripple, leaving the reflections. Our eminent\r\nengineer, Mr Robert Stevenson, made use of the water-telescope more\r\nthan 30 years ago, in works connected with harbour improvement in the\r\nnorth of Scotland; it has also been used to examine the sand-banks,\r\n&c., at the bottom of the River Tay, but in this case the mud\r\nprevented its use in any considerable depth of water. To obviate this\r\ndifficulty, the construction was modified thus: by making the tube of\r\nconsiderable length, and placing the glass at the lower end, this tube\r\nwas thrust through the water till within a few feet of the bottom,\r\nacting as a cofferdam to set aside the dirty water, and enable the\r\nbottom to be seen; but in this method of application it was found very\r\ndifficult to hold the tube down in the water from its buoyant power,\r\nand we are informed by Mr Thomas Stevenson, C. E., that, he understood\r\nfrom this cause its use had been discontinued. He suggested a simple\r\nremedy; viz., to fill up the empty tube with pure water. We are\r\nindebted to Mr Mitchell, the gentleman already mentioned, for having\r\nbrought this instrument into notice in the public prints, under the\r\nname of Norwegian water-telescope, on the shores of which country it\r\nis stated to be much used in fishing--in particular, that of the\r\nherring; but the herring-fishers on the east coast of Scotland inform\r\nus, that they require no such auxiliary, as, from the surrounding\r\nelevated grounds, they can tell the position of the shoal, and, from\r\ntheir motions seen from such situations, they know where they are to\r\nbe found when they go out a-fishing.[50]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 49: Leslie's Elements of Nat. Phil., p. 19.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 50: _Norwegian Water-Telescope._\r\n\r\n     The water-telescope is thus noticed in a very promising\r\n     periodical, the American Annual of Scientific Discovery, just\r\n     published, of which a copy reached us a few days ago.--ED. _Phil.\r\n     Journal_.\r\n\r\n     The water-telescope is an instrument which the people of Norway\r\n     have found of so great utility, that there is scarcely a single\r\n     fishing-boat without one of three or four feet in length, which\r\n     they carry in their boats with them when they go a-fishing. When\r\n     they reach the fishing-grounds, they immerse one end of this\r\n     telescope in the water, and look through the glass, which shews\r\n     objects some ten or fifteen fathoms deep as distinctly as if they\r\n     were within a foot of the surface. When a shoal of fish comes\r\n     into their bays, the Norwegians instantly prepare their nets, man\r\n     their boats, and go out in pursuit. The first process is minutely\r\n     to survey the ground with their glasses, and where they find the\r\n     fish swarming about in great numbers, they give the signal, and\r\n     surround the fish with their large draught-nets, and often catch\r\n     them in hundreds at a time. Without these telescopes their\r\n     business would often prove precarious and unprofitable; as the\r\n     fish, by these glasses, are as distinctly seen in the deep, clear\r\n     sea of Norway, as gold-fish in a crystal jar. This instrument is\r\n     not only used by the fishermen, but is also found aboard the navy\r\n     and coasting-vessels of Norway. When their anchors get into foul\r\n     ground, or their cables warped on a roadstead, they immediately\r\n     apply the glass, and, guided by it, take steps to put all to\r\n     rights, which they could not do so well without the aid of the\r\n     rude and simple instrument, which the meanest fisherman can make\r\n     up with his own hands, without the aid of a craftsman. This\r\n     instrument has been lately adopted by the Scotch fishermen on the\r\n     Tay, and, by its assistance, they have been enabled to discover\r\n     stones, holes, and uneven ground, over which their nets travel,\r\n     and have found the telescope answer to admiration, the minutest\r\n     object in twelve feet of water being as clearly seen as on the\r\n     surface. We see no reason why it could not be used with advantage\r\n     in the rivers and bays of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Experimental Investigations to Discover the Cause of the Change\r\n      which takes place in the Standard Points of Thermometers._\r\n                By JOHN ADIE, F.R.S.E., F.R.S.S.A.\r\n                   Communicated by the Author.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been known to experimentalists that, in thermometers\r\nconstructed with the greatest care, a change takes place after a lapse\r\nof time in the standard points, as given by the melting of ice and\r\nboiling of water under a fixed pressure; on this account it has been\r\nrecommended by most writers, where the employment of thermometers is\r\ntreated of, that they should from time to time be compared one with\r\nanother, and also at the freezing point. This change is a rising of\r\nthe mercury in the tube, so that, after a length of time, the mercury\r\nwill not sink to the point laid off in the construction of the\r\ninstrument. To investigate to what cause this change was due, formed\r\nthe object of my experiments: Was it a change in the glass of which\r\nthe bulbs are formed, or in the mercury with which they are filled? I\r\nwas aware that thermometers filled with alcohol were not subject to\r\nthis change, which would lead to the inference, that the change was in\r\nthe mercury and not the glass; but then, in the spirit-thermometer,\r\nair is left above the column of spirit, whereas, in those constructed\r\nwith mercury, the air is expelled, and there is a vacuum above the\r\ncolumn; consequently, the bulb is pressed together with the force of\r\nan atmosphere on all sides; might not this force, acting for a length\r\nof time, cause some small alteration in the arrangement of the\r\nparticles forming the glass of the bulb?\r\n\r\nThis is the explanation accepted by most of the Italian and French\r\nwriters on this subject. Some suppose that the mercury may contain air\r\nand moisture within its particles; but such a hypothesis I think\r\ninadmissible, as in the case of a vacuum over the mercury, these\r\nparticles would seek the void, and cause rather a depression than a\r\nrising of the freezing point. Mr Daniell, in his Essay on Climate,\r\nadopts the same view; and Sir John Herschel, in his article \"Heat,\" in\r\nthe Encyclopædia Metropolitana, says: \"The freezing point upon the\r\nmercurial thermometer has been supposed to undergo some slight\r\nvariation, so as to appear too low upon the scales of those\r\ninstruments which have been long made; and it is said that, in such\r\ncases, the just indication was again recovered by breaking off the end\r\nof the stem, so as to admit atmospheric air.\" But, as I had observed\r\nthat the change went on for a time only, after which it ceased, and\r\nthat it affected thermometers sealed with air over the mercury, as\r\nwell as those with a vacuum, I undertook the following experiments:--\r\n\r\nIn September 1848 I made four thermometers having long degrees,--such\r\nthat 1/10° might be easily noted, constructed of the same draft of\r\nglass tube; two of these I placed in boiling water, and kept them at\r\nthat temperature for a week: my object in this was to learn if any\r\nchange in the form of the bulb would take place from this slow process\r\nof annealing, as glass is known to undergo some change from such\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nThe four thermometers were now filled with pure mercury: two of these\r\nwere sealed with a vacuum over the mercury; one tube that had been\r\nboiled, and the other not: the other two tubes were sealed with air\r\nover their columns, and the freezing points of all were marked on the\r\ntubes; after which they were placed in a window freely exposed to\r\nlight, where they were left till January 1849--a space of four\r\nmonths--when they were again placed in melting ice, and the freezing\r\npoints marked; they had risen ·24°, ·24°, ·20°, ·06° parts of a\r\ndegree. The whole four thermometers were now placed in boiling water,\r\nand kept there for a week, when the freezing points were again\r\nobserved to have risen respectively ·48°, ·41°, ·50°, ·45°.\r\n\r\nThe instruments were now left exposed to light as at first; and, in\r\nJanuary 1850, the freezing points were again observed, when they were\r\nfound to have farther risen ·12°, ·18°, ·20°, ·13°; and, lastly, they\r\nwere observed in May 1850, when no change from last observation was\r\nnotable.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount of rising of the freezing point in these four\r\nthermometers, after a lapse of eighteen months, is respectively ·84°,\r\n·83°, ·90°, ·65°; and these changes may be the full amount that would\r\ntake place were the instruments observed after a greater lapse of\r\ntime. From my experience, I know that there is a period after which no\r\nchange takes place; but, from the method in which these experiments\r\nhave been conducted, I am not at present in a condition to assign a\r\ntime; moreover, it is evident that this period will be much modified\r\nby circumstances. The results above stated form the following Table:--\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | No.| Description | Value of | Observed  | Rise after |          |       |\r\n  |    |     of      |one Degree|rise, Jan. |  having    | Rise at  | Total |\r\n  |    |Thermometer. | of Fahr. |   1849.   |been boiled |Jan. 1850.| rise. |\r\n  |    |             |          |           |for a week. |          |       |\r\n  |----+-------------+----------+-----------+------------+----------+-------|\r\n  |  { |  Sealed in  | }        |           |            |          |       |\r\n  |1.{ |   vacuum,   | } 0·166  |   0·24    |    0·48    |   0·12   | 0·84  |\r\n  |  { | not boiled. | }        |           |            |          |       |\r\n  |----+-------------+----------+-----------+------------+----------+-------|\r\n  |  { | Sealed in   | }        |           |            |          |       |\r\n  |2.{ | vacuum and  | } 0·168  |   0·24    |    0·41    |   0·18   | 0·83  |\r\n  |  { |   boiled.   | }        |           |            |          |       |\r\n  |----+-------------+----------+-----------+------------+----------+-------|\r\n  |  { | Sealed with | }        |           |            |          |       |\r\n  |3.{ |  air, not   | } 0·199  |   0·20    |    0·50    |   0·20   | 0·90  |\r\n  |  { |   boiled.   | }        |           |            |          |       |\r\n  |----+-------------+----------+-----------+------------+----------+-------|\r\n  |  { |Sealed with  | }        |           |            |          |       |\r\n  |4.{ |air, boiled. | } 0·154  |   0·06    |    0·45    |   0·13   |  0·65 |\r\n  +----+-------------+----------+-----------+------------+----------+-------+\r\n\r\nFrom inspection of the Table, no very remarkable difference is\r\nobservable in the rising of these four instruments. No. 4 appears to\r\nhave risen less during the first period, but goes along with the\r\nothers afterwards. The effect of exposure to the temperature of\r\nboiling water shews that, under high temperature, the change goes on\r\nmuch faster than at the ordinary temperature of the air; from the\r\nTable it will be observed, that about twice the amount of change was\r\ncaused by the boiling of the thermometers for a week, than had taken\r\nplace between the first and second observations, a period of four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the boiling of the thermometer tubes for eight\r\ndays, previous to their being filled with mercury, had produced any\r\nchange on the form of the bulbs; we should at least infer this from\r\nthe change in their freezing points keeping pace so nearly with those\r\nwhich had not been boiled.\r\n\r\nI now come to the concluding experiment with these instruments, and,\r\nit appears to me most interesting and anomalous. The four tubes being\r\nplaced in pounded ice, the columns stood at the points indicated in\r\nthe last column of the Table; in this situation the tops of the tubes\r\nwere broken off, so as to admit the free pressure of the air, and\r\ninstantly the thermometers fell, in the order of their numbers, ·54,\r\n·43, ·40, ·35 of a degree, now indicating on their scales +·30, +·40,\r\n+·50, +·35. The remarkable features shewn by this experiment are;\r\nfirst, that the two thermometers sealed with vacuum, and the two\r\nhaving air over their columns, should have risen nearly equally, when\r\ntwo had their bulbs pressed with the whole force of an atmosphere,\r\nwhile the other two had no pressure externally, farther than that\r\ncaused from changes in the pressure of the atmosphere. Next, that on\r\nbeing opened, those with air over them should have started down nearly\r\nas much as those with a vacuum; and on all these appears a permanent\r\nchange from three to five-tenths of a degree. I confess that I am very\r\nmuch at a loss to account for these singular changes; atmospheric\r\npressure on the bulbs would account for the change in those sealed\r\nwith a vacuum; for we can easily suppose that a permanent form had\r\nbeen taken from long exposure to that pressure by the glass forming\r\nthe bulbs: besides this permanent form, there appears to have been a\r\nspring inwards, which instantly sprung out on removal of the pressure\r\nby the admission of air over the mercury; but the same reasoning will\r\nnot apply to the thermometers having air over the mercury; and before\r\nI attempt to make any suggestions as to the cause of these changes, I\r\npropose to institute the following experiments. Having had three\r\nthermometers blown and filled with mercury, I shall make one with a\r\nperfect vacuum over the mercury, the next with air over it, and the\r\nthird with air condensed over it; and, noting the changes that may go\r\non in these, I hope to be able to assign a cause or causes for the\r\nchange. It is argued by some continental writers on this subject that\r\nthe reason why we do not perceive any change in the freezing point in\r\nspirit-thermometers is from the great expansion of spirit above\r\nmercury, volume for volume, thereby requiring a much smaller mass of\r\nfluid to give the same length of a degree: this I propose to test by\r\nmaking a thermometer with the same size of tube and bulb as those to\r\nbe experimented on with mercury. In mentioning these experiments to\r\nProfessor Forbes, he kindly put me in possession of some\r\nspirit-thermometers, one of these, made in 1837, having a very large\r\nbulb--this, with three others, shewed no change in the places of their\r\nfreezing points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Observations on the Discovery, by_ Professor LEPSIUS, _of Sculptured\r\n    Marks on Rocks in the Nile Valley in Nubia; indicating that,\r\n    within the historical period, the river had flowed at a higher\r\n    level than has been known in Modern Times_.\r\n       By LEONARD HORNER, Esq., F.R.S.S. L. & E., F.G.S., &c.\r\n             Communicated by the Author. With a Plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent archaeological researches of Professor Lepsius in Egypt,\r\nand the Valley of the Nile, in Nubia, have given a deserved celebrity\r\nand authority to his name, among all who take an interest in the early\r\nhistory of that remarkable portion of the Old World. While examining\r\nthe ruins of a fortress, and of two temples of high antiquity at\r\nSemne, in Nubia, he discovered marks cut in the solid rocks, and in\r\nthe foundation-stones of the fortress, indicating that, at a very\r\nremote period in the annals of the country, the Nile must have flowed\r\nat a level considerably above the highest point which it has ever\r\nreached during the greatest inundations in modern times. This\r\nremarkable fact would possess much geological interest with respect to\r\nany great river, but it does so especially in the case of the Nile.\r\nIts annual inundations, and the uniformity in the periods of its rise\r\nand fall, have been recorded with considerable accuracy for many\r\ncenturies; the solid matter held in suspension in its waters, slowly\r\ndeposited on the land overflowed, has been productive of changes in\r\nthe configuration of the country, not only in times long antecedent to\r\nhistory, but throughout all history, down to the present day. Of no\r\nother river on the earth's surface do we possess such or similar\r\nrecords; and moreover, the Nile, and the changes it has produced on\r\nthe physical character of Egypt, are intimately associated with the\r\nearliest records and traditions of the human race. Everything,\r\ntherefore, relating to the physical history of the Nile Valley must\r\nalways be an object of interest; but the discovery of Professor\r\nLepsius is one peculiarly deserving the attention of the geologist;\r\nfor he does not merely record the facts of the markings of the former\r\nhigh level of the river, but he infers from these marks, that since\r\nthe reign of Moeris, about 2200 years before our era, the entire bed\r\nof the Nile, in Lower Nubia, must have been excavated to a depth of\r\nabout 27 feet; and he further speculates as to the process by which he\r\nbelieves the excavation to have been effected.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient, before entering upon the observations I have to\r\noffer upon the cause assigned by Professor Lepsius for the former\r\nhigher levels of the Nile indicated by these marks, that I should give\r\nthe description of the discovery itself, by translating Dr Lepsius's\r\nown account of it, in letters which he addressed to his friends,\r\nProfessors Ehrenberg and Böckh of Berlin, from the island of Philæ, in\r\nSeptember 1844.[51]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 51: Bericht über die zur Bekantmachung geeigneten\r\n     Verhandlungen der Königl. Preuss. Akademie der Wissenshaften zu\r\n     Berlin. Aus dem Jahre 1844.\r\n\r\n  \"You may probably remember, when travelling to Dongola on the\r\n  Lybian side of the Nile, and in passing through the district of\r\n  Batn el hagér, that one of the most considerable of the cataracts\r\n  of the country occurs near Semne, a very old fortress, with a\r\n  handsome temple, built of sandstone, in a good state of\r\n  preservation; the track of the caravan passing close to it, partly\r\n  over the 4000-year-old artificial road. The track on the eastern\r\n  bank of the river is higher up, being carried through the hills;\r\n  and you must turn off from it at this point in order to see the\r\n  cataract. This Nile-pass, the narrowest with which I am\r\n  acquainted, according to the measurement of Hr. Erbkam, is 380\r\n  metres (1247 English feet) broad;[52] and both in itself, and on\r\n  account of the monuments existing there, is one of the most\r\n  interesting localities in the country, and we passed twelve days\r\n  in its examination.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 52: The breadth of the river itself. See Letter to Hr.\r\n     Böckh, p. 27.\r\n\r\n  \"The river is here confined between steep rocky cliffs on both\r\n  sides, whose summits are occupied by two fortresses of the most\r\n  ancient and most massive construction, distinguishable at once\r\n  from the numerous other forts, which, in the time of the Nubian\r\n  power in this land of cliffs, were erected on most of the larger\r\n  islands, and on the hills commanding the river. The cataract (or\r\n  rapid) derives its name of Semne from that of the higher of the\r\n  two fortresses on the western bank; that on the opposite bank, as\r\n  well as a poor village lying somewhat south of it, is called\r\n  Kumme. In both fortresses the highest and best position is\r\n  occupied by a temple, built of huge blocks of sandstone, of two\r\n  kinds, which must have been brought from a great distance through\r\n  the rapids; for, southward, no sandstone is found nearer than\r\n  Gebel Abir, in the neighbourhood of Amara and the island of Sai\r\n  (between 80 and 90 English miles), and northward, there is none\r\n  nearer than the great division of the district at Wadi Haifa (30\r\n  miles distant.)\r\n\r\n  \"Both temples were built in the time of Tutmosis III., a king of\r\n  the 18th dynasty, about 1600 years before Christ; but the\r\n  fortresses in which they stand are of a more ancient date. The\r\n  foundations of these are granite blocks of Cyclopian dimensions,\r\n  resting on the rock, and scarcely inferior to the rock itself in\r\n  durability. They were erected by the first conqueror of the\r\n  country, King Sesuatesen III., of the 12th dynasty, in order to\r\n  command the river, so easily done in so narrow a gorge. The\r\n  immediate successor of this king was Amenemha III., the Moeris of\r\n  the Greeks: he who accomplished the gigantic work of forming the\r\n  artificial lake of Moeris, in the Fayoum, and from whose time--the\r\n  most flourishing of the whole of the old Egyptian kingdom--the\r\n  risings of the Nile in successive years, doubtless by means of\r\n  regular markings, as indeed Diodorus tells, remained so well\r\n  known, that, according to Herodotus, they were recorded in\r\n  distinct numbers from the time of Moeris. It appears that this\r\n  provident king, occupied with great schemes for the welfare of his\r\n  country, considered it of great importance that the rising of the\r\n  Nile on the most southern border of his kingdom should be\r\n  observed, and the results forthwith communicated widely in other\r\n  parts of the land, to prepare the people for the inundations. The\r\n  gorge at Semne offered greater advantages for this object than any\r\n  other point; because the river was there securely confined by\r\n  precipitous rocky cliffs on each side. With the same view he had\r\n  doubtless caused Nilometers to be fixed at Assuan and other\r\n  suitable places; for without a comparison with these, the\r\n  observations at Semne could be of little use.\r\n\r\n  \"The highest rise of the Nile in each year at Semne, was\r\n  registered by a mark, indicating the year of the king's reign, cut\r\n  in the granite, either on one of the blocks forming the foundation\r\n  of the fortress, or on the cliff, and particularly on the east or\r\n  right bank, as best adapted for the purpose. Of these markings\r\n  eighteen still remain, thirteen of them having been made in the\r\n  reign of Moeris, and five in the time of his two next successors.\r\n  These last kings discontinued the observations; for, in the\r\n  meantime, the irruption of the Asiatic pastoral tribes into Lower\r\n  Egypt took place, and wellnigh brought the whole kingdom to ruin.\r\n  The record is almost always in the same terms, short and simple:\r\n  _Ra en Hapi em renpe_ ... mouth or gate of the Nile in the\r\n  year.... And then follows the year of the reign, and the name of\r\n  the king. It is written in a horizontal row of hieroglyphics,\r\n  included within two lines--the upper line indicating the\r\n  particular height of the water, as is often specially stated--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: sketch of hieroglyphics]\r\n\r\n  \"The earliest date preserved is that of the sixth year of the\r\n  king's reign, and he reigned 42 years and some months. The next\r\n  following dates are, the years 9, 14, 15, 20, 22, 23, 24, 30, 32,\r\n  37, 40, 41, and 43; and include, therefore, under this king, a\r\n  period of 37 years. Of the remaining dates, that only of the 4th\r\n  year of his two successors is available; all the others, which are\r\n  on the west or left bank of the river, have been moved from their\r\n  original place by the rapid floods which have overthrown and\r\n  carried forward vast masses of rock. One single mark only, that of\r\n  the 9th year of Amenemha, has been preserved in its original place\r\n  on one of the building stones, but somewhat below the principal\r\n  rapid.[53]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 53: See Plate I.\r\n\r\n  \"We have now to consider the relation which these--the most\r\n  ancient of all existing marks of the risings of the Nile--bear to\r\n  the levels of the river in our own time. We have here presented to\r\n  us the remarkable facts, that the highest of the records now\r\n  legible; viz., that of the 30th year of the reign of Amenemha,\r\n  according to exact measurements which I made, is 8·17 metres (26\r\n  feet 8 inches) higher than the highest level to which the Nile\r\n  rises in years of the greatest floods; and further, that the\r\n  lowest mark, which is on the east bank, and indicated the 15th\r\n  year of the same king, is still 4·14 metres (13 feet 6½ inches);\r\n  and the single mark on the west bank, indicating the 9th year, is\r\n  2·77 metres (9 feet) above the same highest level.\r\n\r\n  \"The mean rise of the river, recorded by the marks on the east\r\n  bank, during the reign of Moeris, is 19·14 metres (62 feet 6\r\n  inches) above the lowest level of the water in the present day,\r\n  which, according to the statements of the most experienced\r\n  boatmen, does not change from year to year, and therefore\r\n  represents the actual level of the Nile, independently of its\r\n  increase by the falls of rain, in the mountains in which its\r\n  sources are situated. The mean rise above the lowest level, at the\r\n  present time, is 11·84 metres (38 feet 8 inches); and, therefore,\r\n  in the time of Moeris, or about 2200 years before Christ, the mean\r\n  height of the river, at the cataract or rapid of Semne, during the\r\n  inundation, was 7·30 metres (23 feet 10 inches) above the mean\r\n  level in the present day.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts recorded by Dr Lepsius; and then follow, in the\r\nsame letter, his views as to the cause of the remarkable lowering of\r\nthe level of the river.\r\n\r\n  \"There is certainly no reason for believing,\" he says, \"that there\r\n  has been any diminution in the general volume of water coming from\r\n  the south. The great change in the level can, therefore, only be\r\n  accounted for by some changes in the land, and these must also\r\n  have altered the whole nature of the Nile Valley. There seems to\r\n  be but one cause for the very considerable lowering of the Nile;\r\n  namely, the washing out and excavations of the catacombs\r\n  (_Answaschen und Aushölen der Katakomben_); and this is quite\r\n  possible from the nature of the rocks themselves, which, it is\r\n  true, are of a quality that could not well be rent asunder, and\r\n  carried away by the mere force of the water, but might be acted\r\n  upon directly by the rising of the water-level, and the consequent\r\n  effects of the sun and air on the places left dry, causing cracks,\r\n  into which earth and sand would penetrate, which would then give\r\n  rise to still greater rents, until, at last, the rocks would of\r\n  themselves fall in, by having been hollowed out, a process that\r\n  would be hastened in those parts of the hills where softer and\r\n  earthy beds existed, and which would be more easily washed away.\r\n  But that, in historical times, within a period of about 4000\r\n  years, so great an alteration should take place in the hardest\r\n  rocks, is a fact of the most remarkable kind,--one which may\r\n  afford ground for many other important considerations.\r\n\r\n  \"The elevation of the water-level at Semne must necessarily have\r\n  affected all the lands above; and, it is to be presumed, that the\r\n  level of the province of Dongola was at one time higher, as Semne\r\n  cannot be the only place in the long tract of cliffs where the bed\r\n  of rock has been hollowed out. It is to be conceived, therefore,\r\n  that not only the widely-extended tracts in Dongola, but those of\r\n  all the higher country in Meroë, and as far up as Fasogle, which,\r\n  in the present day, are dry and barren on both sides of the river,\r\n  and are with difficulty irrigated by artificial contrivances, must\r\n  then have presented a very different aspect, when the Nile\r\n  overflowed them, and yearly deposited its fertile mud to the\r\n  limits of the sandy desert.\r\n\r\n  \"Lower Nubia also, between Wadi Haifa and Assuan, is now arid\r\n  almost throughout its whole extent. The present land of the\r\n  valley, which is only partly irrigated by water-wheels, is, on an\r\n  average, from 6 to 12 feet higher than the level to which the Nile\r\n  now rises; and although the rise at Semne might have no immediate\r\n  influence upon it, yet what has occurred there makes it more than\r\n  probable, that at Assuan there was formerly a very different level\r\n  of the river, and that the cataracts there, even in the historical\r\n  period, have been considerably worn down. The continued\r\n  impoverishment of Nubia is a proof of this. I have no manner of\r\n  doubt that the land in this lower part of the valley, which, as\r\n  already stated, is at present about 10 feet above the highest rise\r\n  of the Nile, was inundated by it within historical time. Many\r\n  marks are also met with here, that leave no doubt regarding the\r\n  condition of the Nile Valley antecedent to history, when the river\r\n  must have risen much higher; for it has left an alluvial soil in\r\n  almost all the considerable bays, at an average height of 10\r\n  metres (32 feet 9 inches) above the present mean rise of the\r\n  river. That alluvial soil, since that period, has doubtless been\r\n  considerably diminished in extent by the action of rain. On the\r\n  17th of August Hr. Erbkam and I measured the nearest alluvial\r\n  hillock in the neighbourhood of Korusko, and found it 6·91 metres\r\n  (22 feet 7 inches) above the general level of the valley, and\r\n  10·26 metres (33 feet 7 inches) above the present mean rise of the\r\n  river. That rise, which at Semne, on account of the greater\r\n  confinement of the stream between the rocks, varies as much as\r\n  2·40 metres (7 feet 10 inches) in different years, varies at\r\n  Korusko less than 1 metre (3 feet 3 inches).\r\n\r\n  \"Near Abusimbel, on the west bank, I found the ground of the\r\n  temple 6·50 metres (21 feet 2 inches) above the highest\r\n  water-level. This temple, it is well known, was built under\r\n  Rameses the Great, between 1388 and 1322 years before Christ. Near\r\n  Ibrim there are, on the east bank, four grottoes excavated in the\r\n  vertical rock that bounds the river, which belong partly to the\r\n  18th and partly to the 19th dynasties; the last, under Rameses the\r\n  Great, is also the lowest, and only 2·50 metres (8 feet 1 inch)\r\n  above the highest inundation; the next in height is 2·70 metres (8\r\n  feet 9½ inches) above the former, and was made 250 years earlier,\r\n  under Tutmes III. Although I only measured the present level of\r\n  the valley near Korusko, nevertheless it appears to me that,\r\n  during the whole of the new kingdom, that is, from about 1700\r\n  years before Christ to this time, the Nile has not reached to the\r\n  full height of the low land of the valley.\r\n\r\n  \"It is, however, conceivable that, at the time when the present\r\n  low land of the Nubian Valley was formed, the cataracts at Assuan\r\n  were in a totally different state; one that would, in some degree,\r\n  justify the overcharged descriptions of the ancients, according to\r\n  whom they made so great a noise that the dwellers near them became\r\n  deaf. The damming up of the inundation at Assuan could have no\r\n  material influence on Egypt, any more than that at Semne, or the\r\n  land from thence to Assuan.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears therefore, from the above statements, that at the time\r\nmentioned, the Nile, during the inundations, stood 26 feet 8 inches\r\nhigher than the highest level to which it now rises in years of the\r\ngreatest floods; and that, to account for this, Professor Lepsius\r\nconceives that, between the time of Moesis and the present day, the\r\nbed of the Nile, from a considerable distance above Semne to Assuan,\r\nmust have been worn down to that extent. In the index to the volume of\r\nthe Berlin Monatsbericht, in which the letters of Professor Lepsius\r\nare inserted, there is the following line:--\r\n\r\n  \"NIL, _senkung seines Bettes um 25 Fuss seit 4000 Jahren_.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_Nile_, sinking of its bed about 25 feet (Paris) within the last\r\n  4000 years.\"\r\n\r\nRivers are, undoubtedly, among the most active agents of change that\r\nare operating on the earth's surface; the solid matter which renders\r\ntheir waters turbid, and which they unceasingly carry to the sea,\r\nafford indisputable proof of this agency. But the power of rivers to\r\nabrade and wear down the rocks over which they flow, and to form and\r\ndeepen their own bed, depends upon a variety of circumstances not\r\nalways taken into account; and although the great extent of that\r\npower, in both respects, is shewn in the case of many rivers, to\r\nconclude, as some have done, from these instances, that all rivers\r\nhave excavated the channels in which they flow, is a generalization\r\nthat cannot be safely assented to. The excavation of the bed of a\r\nriver is one of those problems in geological dynamics which can only\r\nbe rightly solved by each particular case being subjected to the\r\nrigorous examination of the mathematician and the physicist. The solid\r\nmatter which rivers carry forward is in part only the produce of their\r\nown abrading power; and the amount of it must be proportional to that\r\npower, which is mainly dependent on their velocity; they are the\r\nrecipients of the waste of the adjoining lands by other combined\r\nagencies, and the carriers of it to the lower districts and to the\r\nsea. They often afford the strongest evidence of the vast lapse of\r\ntime that must be included between the beginning and close of a\r\ngeological period; and, when they flow through countries whose remote\r\npolitical history is known to us, they supply a scale by which we may\r\nmeasure and estimate that lapse of time. This is especially so in the\r\ncase of the Nile.\r\n\r\nWhen so startling an hypothesis as that now referred to, viz., that\r\nthe entire bed of so vast a river as the Nile, for more than 250\r\nmiles, from Semne to Assuan, has been excavated, within historical\r\ntime, to a depth of 27 feet, is made by a person whose name carries so\r\nmuch weight in one department of philosophical inquiry, the statement\r\ninvolves such important geological considerations, that it becomes the\r\nduty of the geologist to examine, and thoroughly test the soundness of\r\nthe explanation, in order that the authority of Professor Lepsius, for\r\nthe accuracy of the facts observed, may not be too readily admitted as\r\nconclusive for the correctness of his theory of the cause to which\r\nthey owe their existence. That there has been such an undoubting\r\nadmission, appears from the following passage in the work of one of\r\nthe latest writers on Nubia:--\r\n\r\n  \"The translation of the name of this town (Aswán) is 'the\r\n  opening;' and a great opening this once was, before the Nile had\r\n  changed its character in Ethiopia, and when the more ancient races\r\n  made this rock (at the first cataract) their watch-tower on the\r\n  frontier between Egypt and the south. That the Nile has changed\r\n  its character, south of the first cataract, has been made clear by\r\n  some recent examinations of the shores and monuments of Nubia. Dr\r\n  Lepsius has discovered water-marks so high on the rocks and\r\n  edifices, and so placed as to compel the conviction that the bed\r\n  of the Nile has sunk extraordinarily by some great natural\r\n  process, either of convulsion or wear. The apparent exaggerations\r\n  of some old writers about the cataracts at Syene may thus be in\r\n  some measure accounted for. If there really was once a cataract\r\n  here, instead of the rapids of the present day, there is some\r\n  excuse for the reports given from hearsay by Cicero and Seneca.\r\n  Cicero says, that 'the river throws itself headlong from the\r\n  loftiest mountains, so that those who live nearest are deprived of\r\n  the sense of hearing, from the greatness of the noise.' Seneca's\r\n  account is: 'When some people were stationed there by the\r\n  Persians, their ears were so stunned with the constant roar, that\r\n  it was found necessary to remove them to a more quiet place.'\"[54]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 54: Miss Martineau's Eastern Life, vol. i., p. 99.\r\n\r\n_Note._--The learned author of an article on Egyptian Chronology and\r\nHistory in the \"Prospective Review\" for May 1850, in referring to the\r\ncontributions of Professor Lepsius to Egyptian history, says, \"He has\r\ndiscovered undescribed pyramids, equal in number to those known\r\nbefore; has traced the Labyrinth, and ascertained its founder. _He has\r\ndetected inscriptions on the banks of the Nile, which show that its\r\nbed has subsided many feet in historic times.\" 9th June 1850_.\r\n\r\nIn the assumption of an excavation of the bed of the river, we have no\r\nsmall amount of wear to deal with, for the distance from Semne to\r\nAssuan, following the course of the river, is not less than 250 miles;\r\nand if, as Professor Lepsius supposes, the excavation extended to\r\nMeroë, we have a distance, between that place and Assuan, of not less\r\nthan 600 miles.\r\n\r\nAlthough these records of a former high level of the Nile at Semne had\r\nnot been noticed by any traveller prior to Professor Lepsius, we may\r\nrest fully assured of the accuracy of his statements, from the\r\nhabitual care and diligence, and the established character for\r\nfidelity, of the observer. The silence of other travellers may be\r\nreadily accounted for by this, that none of them appear to have\r\nremained more than a very short time at this spot--not even the\r\ndiligent Russegger--whereas we have seen that Professor Lepsius passed\r\ntwelve days in the examination of this gorge in the Nile Valley.\r\n\r\nThe theory of a lowering of the bed of the river by wearing, involves\r\ntwo main considerations, viz., the power of the stream, and the degree\r\nof hardness of the rocks acted upon. The power depends upon the volume\r\nand velocity of the river--the velocity on its depth, and the degree\r\nof inclination of the bed: the hardness of the rocks we can form a\r\ntolerable estimate of when we know their nature. To judge, therefore,\r\nof the probability of the hypothesis of Professor Lepsius, we must\r\ninquire into the physical and geological features of the Nile Valley,\r\nin Nubia.\r\n\r\nIn the observations I have now to offer, my information has been\r\nderived of course entirely from the works of other travellers,\r\nparticularly those of Burckhardt, Rüppell, and Russegger,[55] and\r\nespecially the latter, who travelled in Nubia in 1837; for he not only\r\nenters far more into the details of the natural history of the\r\ncountry, but he is the only traveller in Nubia who appears, from\r\nprevious acquirements, to have been competent to describe its natural\r\nhistory with any degree of accuracy--I refer more particularly to the\r\nphysical and geological features of the country. Besides full\r\ndescriptions in his volumes, he has given a geological map of Nubia,\r\nand also several sections, or what may more properly be called\r\n_vertical sketches_--a term that would, perhaps, be a more appropriate\r\ndesignation for all sections that are not drawn to a true scale, or at\r\nleast when the proportion of height to horizontal distance is not\r\nstated.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 55: Reisen in Europa Asien und Afrika, in der Jahren\r\n     1835, bis 1841.--Stuttgart 1841-1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _The Physical Geography of Lower Nubia._[56]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 56: With reference to the object of this paper.\r\n\r\nRussegger informs us,[57] that he believes he was the first traveller\r\nwho had succeeded in making a series of barometrical measurements\r\nalong the Nile Valley, from the Mediterranean to Sennaar and Kordofan,\r\nand thence to the 10th degree of north latitude.

Korusko being 115 feet above the head of the cataract\r\nof Assuan, at Philæ, we have an average fall of the river between\r\nthese two places of a foot in a mile.\r\n\r\nBetween Korusko and Wadi-Halfa there is no rapid. The distance being\r\n20 German, or 96 English miles, and the difference of altitude being\r\n42½ feet, we have an average fall throughout that part of the river's\r\ncourse of not more than 5·3 inches in a mile.\r\n\r\nThis very inconsiderable fall need not surprise us; for the average\r\nfall of the Nile in Lower Egypt, at the lowest water, is little more\r\nthan one-third of that now stated. At the time of the highest water\r\nthe surface of the Nile, at Boulak, near Cairo; that is, about 116\r\nmiles in a direct line from the coast is only 43·437 English feet\r\nabove the level of the Mediterranean, and at the time of the lowest\r\nwater, only 17·33 feet. Thus, in the first case, there is an average\r\nfall of about 5·00 inches; in the second, of not more than 1·80 inches\r\nin a mile.[59]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 59: Russegger, Reisen, Bd. i., 258.\r\n\r\nBetween Wadi Halfa and Dale, a distance of about 94 miles, six\r\ncataracts, or schellals, as they are called in the language of the\r\ncountry, are marked in Russegger's map. And here, it may be as well to\r\nnotice, that there are no cataracts, in the ordinary sense of the\r\nterm, on the Nile; no fall of the river over a precipice; all the\r\nso-called cataracts are rapids, where the river rushes through rocks\r\nin its bed; the rapids varying in their length and degrees of\r\ninclination. We have no measurements of their lengths or of their\r\nfalls, except as regards the first and second cataracts. The former,\r\naccording to Russegger, has a fall of about 85 English feet in a\r\ndistance of about 8 miles; and he describes the latter as extending\r\nfrom 5 to 6 _stunden_; that is, from 12 to 14½ miles, but he does not\r\ngive the height. Speaking of the schellals above Semne, Russegger\r\nsays, that all may be passed in boats without difficulty for about six\r\nweeks, or two months in the year. This is the case also, at the\r\ncataract or rapid of Assuan. But between Wadi-Halfa and Dale, with\r\nsome inconsiderable spaces of free navigable water, in the ordinary\r\nstate of the river, there is an almost uninterrupted series of rapids.\r\nWe have no measurement of the height of Dale above Wadi-Halfa, near to\r\nwhich the second great cataract of the Nile occurs; but this is the\r\npart of the river's course where the fall is greatest, and from Semne\r\nto Dale there are about 45 miles of this more rapid fall.\r\n\r\nFrom Dale to New Dongola, a distance of 35 German, or about 168\r\nEnglish miles, only three rapids are marked on Russegger's map--the\r\nhighest being at Hannek, about 26 English miles below New Dongola. New\r\nDongola being 806 English feet above the sea, and the distance from\r\nthat place to the rapid of Hannek being 26 miles only, we may with\r\nprobability estimate the surface of the river at the rapid of Hannek\r\nat 780 feet above the sea. Now, Wadi-Halfa being 522 feet, we have a\r\ndifference of height, between these two last-named places, of 258\r\nfeet; and the length of the river's course between them being 236\r\nmiles, we have an average fall of 13·12 inches in a mile; that is, in\r\nthe part of the river's course where nine rapids occur, in the\r\nprovinces of Batn-el-Hadjar, Sukkot, and Dar-el-Mahass, where the\r\nriver flows over granite and other plutonic rocks; gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, and other hard rocks, which Russegger considers to be\r\nmetamorphic. But between Semne and the head of the second cataract at\r\nWadi-Halfa, there is not a continuous rapid stream; for Hoskins says,\r\nthat about two miles above that cataract, the river has a width of a\r\nthird of a mile, and, when he passed it the water was scarcely\r\nruffled.[60]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 60: Travels in Ethiopia, p. 272.\r\n\r\nFrom the rapid of Hannek to Abu Hammed, the distance is 329 English\r\nmiles, and the difference of altitude is 246 English feet. We have\r\nthus an average fall in that distance of 9·00 inches in a mile.\r\n\r\nThus, in the 776 miles between Abu Hammed and Philæ, we have an\r\naverage fall of the Nile\r\n\r\n  Of 9·00 inches in a mile, for a distance of 329 miles.\r\n  Of 13·12   .........         .........      236 ...\r\n  Of 5·30    .........         .........       96 ...\r\n  Of 12·00   .........         .........      115 ...\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of the Breadth, Depth, and Velocity of the Nile, in Nubia._\r\n\r\nOur information is very scanty respecting the breadth and depth of the\r\nriver, either at the time of lowest water or during the inundations.\r\nAbout two miles above Philæ, it is stated by Jomard[61] to be 3000\r\nmetres, or nearly two English miles wide. At the second cataract, or\r\nrapid of Wadi-Halfa, it spreads over a rocky bed of nearly two miles\r\nand a-quarter in width (2000 klafter),[62] but contracts above the\r\nrapid to a third of a mile. Russegger also states, that the Nile, near\r\nBoulak, in Lower Egypt, is 2000 toises, nearly two-and-a-half English\r\nmiles in breadth, and yet that it is considerably wider in some parts\r\nof Southern Nubia; but Burckhardt says, that the bed of the Nile in\r\nNubia is, in general, much narrower than in any part of Egypt. Near\r\nKalabsche, about 30 miles above Philæ, the river runs through a gorge\r\nnot more than 300 paces wide, and its bed is full of granite blocks.\r\nIt shortly afterwards again widens for some distance; but near Sialla,\r\n78 miles above Philæ, it is contracted by the sandstone hills on both\r\nsides coming so near each other, that the river's bed is again not\r\nmore than from 250 to 300 paces wide. It is about 600 yards broad\r\nabout two miles above the second cataract near Wadi-Halfa, but is\r\nagain very much contracted in the rocky region of Batn-el-Hadjar. At\r\nAulike it is only 200 paces broad.[63]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 61: Description de l'Égypte.--Separate Memoir entitled,\r\n     \"Description de Syène et des Cataractes.\"\r\n\r\n     Footnote 62: Russegger, Bd. ii., 3 Thl. 85.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 63: Russegger, Bd. ii., 3 Thl. 76.\r\n\r\nI have not met with any measurements of the depth of the river in any\r\npart of its course in Nubia; but Hoskins describes it as being so\r\nshallow at the island of Sais, 327 miles above Philæ, on the 9th of\r\nJune, which would be before the commencement of the inundation, as\r\nonly to reach the knees of the camels.[64] Near Derr, about 86 miles\r\nbelow the Cataract of Wadi-Halfa, Norden, in January, found the river\r\nso shallow that loaded camels waded through it, and his boat\r\nfrequently struck the ground. In May, Burckhardt found the river\r\nfordable at Kostamne, 53 miles above Philæ; and Parthey states, that\r\nbetween Philæ and the island of Bageh, to the west of it, the river is\r\nso shallow before the commencement of the inundation, that it may be\r\nwaded through.[65] Burckhardt says, that from March to June the\r\nNile-water, in Nubia, is quite limpid.[66] Miss Martineau, who visited\r\nNubia in December and January, speaking of the river above Philæ says,\r\nthat it \"was divided into streamlets and ponds by the black islets.\r\nWhere it was overshadowed it was dark-gray or deep blue, but when the\r\nlight caught it rushing between a wooded island and the shore, it was\r\nof the clearest green.\"[67] At the second cataract she describes the\r\nriver as \"dashing and driving among its thousand islets, and then\r\ngathering its thousand currents into one, proceeds calmly in its\r\ncourse.\"[68]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 64: Travels, p. 257.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 65: Wanderungen durch das Nilthal, von G.

In the year 1794, the late Mr Rennie\r\nfound the velocity of the Thames at Windsor two miles and a half per\r\nhour.\"[69]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 69: Rennie, Report on Hydraulics, in the Fourth Report\r\n     of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1834,\r\n     p. 487.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the velocity of the Nile is probably greatly\r\ninferior to that of the Thames; for it appears that, except during the\r\ninundation, for more than half the year the depth is inconsiderable.\r\nThe average fall when greatest, that is, including the province of\r\nBatn-el-Hadjar, where the rapids chiefly occur, is considerably less\r\nthan that of any part of the above course of the Thames; so that there\r\nmust be long intervals between the rapids where the fall must be far\r\nless than 13 inches in a mile. The breadth of the Nile is vastly\r\ngreater; but supposing the depth of the water to be the same as that\r\nof the Thames, on account of the friction of the bed, the greater\r\nbreadth would add very little to the velocity. If we assume the\r\naverage depth of the Thames in the above distance to be 5 feet, and\r\nthat it flows with an average velocity of 2 miles in an hour, and if\r\nwe assume the average depth of the Nile in that part of its course\r\nwhere the fall is 13·12 inches to be 10 feet, when not swollen by the\r\nrise, the velocity would be 2 miles nearly in an hour,[70] if the\r\nfall were equal to that of the Thames. We shall probably come near the\r\ntruth, by assuming the velocity of the Nile on this part at 2 miles in\r\nan hour. That it must be considerably less in the other divisions of\r\nthe course I have named, and especially in that part immediately below\r\nthe second cataract, where the average fall is only 5·30 inches for a\r\ndistance of 96 miles, is quite evident.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 70: I state this on the authority of my friend, W.\r\n     Hopkins, Esq., of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe power of a river to abrade the soil over which it flows, so far as\r\nwater is by itself capable of doing so, must depend upon its volume\r\nand velocity, and the degree of hardness of the material acted upon.\r\nThe power is increased when the water has force enough to transport\r\nhard substances. But even transported gravel has little action on the\r\nrocks with which it comes in contact, when it is free to move in\r\nrunning water, unless the fall be considerable, and, consequently, the\r\nvelocity and force of the stream great. When stones are firmly set in\r\nmoving ice, they then acquire a great erosive power, cutting and\r\nwearing down the rocks they are forcibly rubbed against; but this\r\ncondition never obtains in Lower Nubia, as ice is unknown there.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Geological Structure of Lower Nubia._\r\n\r\nOne kind only of regularly stratified rock occurs in the 776 miles\r\nfrom Abu Hammed to Philæ; viz. a silicious sandstone, similar to that\r\nwhich occurs to a great extent on both sides of the Nile in Upper\r\nEgypt, and which Russegger, after a very careful examination of it\r\nthere, considers to be an equivalent of the greensand of the\r\ncretaceous rocks of Europe. The tertiary nummulite limestone, so\r\nabundant in Egypt, has not hitherto been met with in Nubia.\r\n\r\nThe Nile flows over this sandstone for nearly 426 miles of the entire\r\ndistance, but not continuously. At Abu Hammed, it flows over granitic\r\nrocks, and these continue from that place for about 120 miles. There\r\nis then about 215 miles of the sandstone, which is succeeded by\r\nigneous and metamorphic rocks, that continue for 195 miles without any\r\ninterruption, except a narrow stripe of sandstone of about 15 miles\r\nnear Amara. It is in this region of hard igneous rocks that nearly all\r\nthe rapids occur, between that of Hannek and the great or second\r\ncataract at Wadi-Halfa. From the latter place there is sandstone\r\nthroughout a distance of about 196 miles, and then commences the\r\ngranitic region of the Cataract of Assuan, through which the Nile\r\nflows about 35 miles. Thus we have about 350 miles of igneous and\r\nmetamorphic rocks, and about 426 of sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe general hard nature of the igneous and metamorphic rocks, over\r\nwhich the Nile flows for about 155 miles above Semne, and for about 40\r\nimmediately below it, will be recognised by my naming some of the\r\nvarieties described by Russegger, viz. granites of various kinds,\r\noften penetrated by greenstone dykes; sienite, diorite, and felspar\r\nporphyries; gneiss, and clay slate, penetrated by numerous quartz\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nThe siliceous sandstone is very uniform in its character; and in\r\nNubia, as in Egypt, the only organic bodies which it has as yet been\r\nfound to contain, are silicified stems of wood. Occasionally, as in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Korusko, interstratified beds of marly clay are\r\nmet with.[71]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 71: Russegger, Bd. ii., 1 Thl. 569 to 584.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we take into account the hard nature of the siliceous\r\nsandstone, the durability of which is shewn by the very ancient\r\nmonuments of Egypt and Nubia, that are formed of it, and the still\r\ngreater hardness of the granites and other crystalline rocks, it is\r\nmanifest that the wearing action of a river flowing over so gentle a\r\nfall, can scarcely be appreciable. If the occasional beds of marly\r\nclay occur in the bank of the river, they may be washed out, and\r\nblocks of the superincumbent sandstones may fall down; but such an\r\noperation would have a tendency to raise rather than deepen the bed of\r\nthe river at those places; unless the transporting power of the stream\r\nwere far greater than can exist with so moderate a fall, especially in\r\nthat part of the river below Semne, where, for 96 miles, it is not\r\nmore than 5·3 inches, and for 115 miles below that, not more than 12\r\ninches in a mile. Even if we suppose the river to have power to tear\r\nup its bed for some distance above Semne and below it, as far as the\r\nrapid of Wadi-Halfa, it is evident that the materials brought down\r\nwould be deposited, except the finest particles, in that tranquil run\r\nof 96 miles, which may be almost compared to a canal. The drains in\r\nLincolnshire are inclined 5 inches to a mile.[72] When the annual\r\ninundations commence, the water of the Nile comes down the rapid at\r\nAssuan of a reddish colour, loaded with sand and mud only; whatever\r\ndetrital matter of a larger and heavier kind the Nile may have brought\r\nwith it, is deposited before it reaches that point.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 72: Rennie, Report cited above, p. 422.\r\n\r\nFrom all these considerations, therefore, I come to the conclusion,\r\nthat the bed of the Nile cannot have been excavated, as Professor\r\nLepsius supposes, since the date of the sculptured marks on the rock\r\nat Semne. He says, \"Es lässt sich kaum eine andere Ursache für das\r\nbedentende Fallen des Nils denken, als ein Answaschen und Aushölen\r\n_der Katakomben_.\" By the word _Katakomben_ he can only mean natural\r\ncaverns in the rock; but such caverns are rarely, if ever, met with in\r\nsandstones, and only occasionally in limestones. If the course of the\r\nNile were over limestone instead of sandstone, we could not for a\r\nmoment entertain the idea of a succession of caverns for 200 miles\r\nbeneath its bed, sometimes two miles in width, the roofs of which were\r\nto fall in; and where the igneous rocks prevail, this explanation is\r\nwholly inapplicable.\r\n\r\nBut besides the objections arising from the nature of the rocks, and\r\nthe inconsiderable fall of the river, there is still another\r\ndifficulty to overcome. It is to be borne in mind, that this lowering\r\nof the bed of the Nile, from Semne to Assuan, is supposed to have\r\ntaken place within the last 4000 years. Between the first cataract at\r\nAssuan and the second at Wadi-Halfa, there are numerous remains of\r\ntemples on both banks of the Nile, some of very great antiquity. \"From\r\nWadi-Halfa to Philæ,\" says Parthey, \"there is a vast number of\r\nEgyptian monuments, almost all on the left bank of the river, and so\r\nnear the water that most of them are in immediate contact with\r\nit.\"[73] We may rest assured that the builders of these would place\r\nthem out of the reach of the highest inundations then known. Although\r\nwe have many accurate descriptions of these monuments, the heights of\r\ntheir foundations above the surface of the river are not often given;\r\nthey are, however, mentioned in some instances. I shall describe the\r\nsituations of some of these buildings relatively to the present state\r\nof the river's levels, and shall begin with those on the island of\r\nPhilæ.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 73: Parthey, 318.\r\n\r\nThis island, according to the measurements of General von Prokesh, is\r\n1200 Paris feet (1278 English) in length, and 420 (447) in breadth,\r\nand is composed of granite. Lancrot informs us, that, \"à l'époque des\r\nhautes eaux, l'île de Philæ est peu élevé audessus de leur surface,\r\nmais lorqu'elles sont abaissées elle les surpasse de huit metres.\" It\r\nwas formerly surrounded by a quay of masonry, portions of which may be\r\ntraced at intervals, and in some places they are still in good\r\npreservation. The south-west part of the island is occupied by\r\ntemples. According to Wilkinson, the principal building is a temple of\r\nIsis commenced by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who reigned from 283 to 247\r\nyears before Christ; and he adds, that it is evident an ancient\r\nbuilding formerly stood on the site of the present great temple.\r\nLancrot, in referring to this more ancient building, says:--\"Il y a\r\ndes preuves certaines d'une antiquité bien plus reculeé encore,\r\npuisque des pierres qui entrent dans la construction de ce même grand\r\ntemple, sont des débris de quelque construction antérieure.\"\r\nRossellini considers that it was built by Nectanabis. The first king\r\nof Egypt, of the Sebennite dynasty of that name, ascended the throne\r\n374 years B.C., the second and last ceased to reign about 350 years\r\nB.C.[74]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 74: Russegger, Reison, Bd. ii. 300 and 320.

Ptolemy,\r\n     Ph. and Nectanabis.\r\n\r\nRossellini[75] informs us, that on the island of Bageh, opposite to\r\nPhilæ, there are the remains of a temple of the time of Amenophis II.,\r\nand a sitting statue of granite representing him. He was a king in the\r\nearlier years of the 18th dynasty, which, according to the Chevalier\r\nBunsen,[76] began in the year 1638, and ended in 1410 B.C.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 75: P. 187.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 76: Egyptens Stelle in der Weltgeschichte.--Drittes\r\n     Buch, 122.\r\n\r\nGAU,[77] in describing a temple at Debu, about 12 miles above Philæ,\r\nwhich he visited in January, and consequently during the time of low\r\nwater, states that he discovered under the sand, at the edge of the\r\nriver, the remains of a terrace leading towards a temple.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 77: Antiquités de la Nubie, p. 6.\r\n\r\nA short distance north of Kalabsche, about 30 miles above Philæ, at\r\nBeil-nalli, Rossellini[78] speaks of a small temple in the following\r\nterms:--\"Among the many memorials that still exist of Ramses II., the\r\nmost important, in a historical point of view, is a small temple or\r\ngrotto excavated in the rock;\" and Wilkinson mentions it \"as a small\r\nbut interesting temple excavated in the rock, of the time of Rameses\r\nII., whom Champellion supposes to be the father of Sesostris or\r\nRameses the Great.\"[79] He was the first king of the 19th dynasty,\r\nwhich began in the year 1409 B.C.[80]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 78: Tome III., Parte II., p. 6.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 79: Thebes, &c., p. 482.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 80: Bunsen, as above.\r\n\r\nGau[81] thus describes a monument at Gerbé Dandour:--\"La chaine de\r\nmontagnes qui borde le Nil est, dans cet endroit, si approchée du lit\r\nde ce fleuve, qu'il ne reste que très peu d'espace sur la rive. Cet\r\nespace est presque entièrement occupé par le monument, et la rivière,\r\ndans ses débordemens, arrive jusqu'au pied du mur de la terrasse.\"\r\n\r\n     Footnote 81: P. 9.\r\n\r\nParthey informs us that the temple of Sebua is about 200 feet distant\r\nfrom the river, in which distance there are two rows of sphinxes, and\r\nthat the road between them, from the temple, ends in wide steps at the\r\nwater's edge; and he adds, that Champellion refers this temple to the\r\ntime of Rameses the Great.[82]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 82: Warnderungen, &c., 334.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that monuments exist close to the river, some of which\r\nwere constructed at least 1400 years before our era; so that taking\r\nthe time of Amenemha III. to be, as Professor Lepsius states, 2200\r\nyears B.C., the excavation of the bed of the Nile which he supposes to\r\nhave taken place, must have been the work, not of 4000 years but of\r\n800. If the erosive power of the river was so active in that time, it\r\ncannot be supposed that it then ceased; it would surely have continued\r\nto deepen the bed during the following 3000 years.\r\n\r\nAt all events, the buildings on the island of Philæ demonstrate that\r\nthe bed of the Nile must have been very much the same as it is now,\r\n2200 years ago; and even a thousand years earlier it must have been\r\nthe same, if the foundation of the temple on the island of Begh,\r\nopposite to Philæ, be near the limit of the highest rise of the Nile\r\nof the present time; so that there could be no barrier at the Cataract\r\nof Assuan to dam up the Nile when they were constructed; and thus the\r\ndeafening sound of the waterfall recorded by Cicero and Seneca must\r\nstill be held to be an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nThe existence of alluvial soil, apparently of the same kind as that\r\ndeposited by the Nile, in situations above the Cataract of Assuan, at\r\na level considerably above the highest point which the inundations of\r\nthe river have reached in modern times, to which allusion is made by\r\nProfessor Lepsius, has been noticed by other travellers, and even at\r\nstill higher levels than those he mentions. Whether that alluvial soil\r\nbe identical with, or only resembles the Nile deposit, would require\r\nto be determined by a close examination, and especially with regard to\r\norganic remains, if any can be found in it. There is no evidence to\r\nshew that it was deposited during the historical period, and it may be\r\nan evidence of a depression and subsequent elevation of the land\r\nantecedent to that period. It may not be of fresh-water origin, but\r\nthe clay and sand, or till, left by a drift while the land was under\r\nthe sea. For remote as is the antiquity of Nubia and Egypt, in\r\nrelation to the existence of the human race, it appears to be of very\r\nmodern formation in geological time. The greater part of Lower Egypt,\r\nprobably all the Delta, is of post-pliocene age, and even late in that\r\nage; and the very granite of the Cataract of Assuan, that of which the\r\noldest monuments in Egypt are formed, and which, in the earlier days\r\nof geology, was looked upon as the very type of the rock on which the\r\noldest strata of the earth were founded, is said to have burst forth\r\nduring the later tertiary period. We learn from Russegger, that the\r\nlow land which lies between the Mediterranean and the range of hills\r\nthat extends from Cairo to the Red Sea at Suez, and of which hills a\r\nnummulite limestone constitutes a great part, is composed of a\r\nsandstone which he calls a \"Meeresdiluvium,\" a marine diluvial\r\nformation, and considers to be of an age younger than that of the\r\nsub-appennines.[83] This sandstone he found associated with the\r\ngranite above Assuan, and covering the cretaceous sandstone far into\r\nNubia. It appears, therefore, that, in the later ages of the tertiary\r\nperiod, this north-eastern part of Africa must have been submerged,\r\nand that very energetic plutonic action was going forward in the then\r\nbed of the sea. The remarkable fact of the granite bursting through\r\nthis modern sandstone is thus described by Russegger:--\r\n\r\n  \"We arrived at a plateau of the Arabian Chain south-east of\r\n  Assuan. It is about 200 feet above the bed of the Nile, and\r\n  consists of the lower and upper sandstone, which are penetrated by\r\n  innumerable granite cones from 20 to 100 feet in height, arranged\r\n  over the plateau in parallel lines, very much resembling volcanic\r\n  cones rising from a great cleft. The sandstone is totally altered\r\n  in texture near the granite, and has all the appearance as if it\r\n  had been exposed to a great heat. 'I cannot refrain,' he says,\r\n  'from supposing that the granite must have burst, like a volcanic\r\n  product, through long wide rents in the sandstone, and that, in\r\n  this way, the conical hills were formed.'\"[84]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 83: Reisen, Bd. I., s. 273.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 84: Id., Bd. II., I. Thl. s. 328.\r\n\r\nAn eruption of a true granite during the period of the sub-appennine\r\nformations, one possessing the same mineral structure as that we\r\nknow to have been erupted during the period of the palæozoic rocks,\r\nwould be a fact of so extraordinary a kind, that its age would\r\nrequire to be established on the clearest evidence, and especially\r\nby that of organic remains in the sandstone.\r\n\r\nHaving thus ventured--I trust without any want of the respect due to\r\nso eminent a person--to reject the hypothesis proposed by Professor\r\nLepsius for the high levels of the Nile at Semne, indicated by the\r\nsculptured marks he discovered, it may perhaps be expected that I\r\nshould offer another more probable explanation. If in some narrow\r\ngorge of the river below Semne, a place had been described by any\r\ntraveller, where, from the nature of the banks, a great landslip, or\r\neven an artificial dam, could have raised the bed to an adequate\r\nheight; that is, proportionate to the fall of the river, as it was\r\nmore distant from Semne, a bar that, in the course of a few\r\ncenturies, might have been gradually washed away, I might have\r\nventured to suggest such a solution of the problem. But without any\r\ninformation of the existence of such a contraction of the river's\r\nchannel, or any exact knowledge of the natural outlets and dams to\r\nrunning water along the 250 miles of the Nile Valley, from Semne to\r\nAssuan, it would be idle to offer even a conjecture. These marks are\r\nunquestionably very difficult to account for, in the present\r\nimperfect state of our knowledge of the structure of that portion of\r\nthe Nile Valley; and any competent geologist, well versed in the\r\nquestions of physical structure involved, who may hereafter visit\r\nNubia, would have a very interesting occupation in endeavouring to\r\nsolve the difficulty.\r\n\r\n  _7th April 1850._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Marks of the Levels of the Nile near the Cataracts of\r\nSemne in the time of King Amenemha III. (Moeris) about 2200 Years B.C.\r\ncompared with the present levels._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                _On the Salmon Tribe (Salmonidæ.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nSo long as the family _Salmonidæ_ remains circumscribed as it was\r\nestablished by Cuvier, it seems to be a type almost universally\r\ndiffused over the globe, occurring equally in the sea and in\r\nfresh-water, so that we are left almost without a clue to its natural\r\nrelations to the surrounding world. Joh. Muller, working out some\r\nsuggestions of Prince Canino, and introducing among them more precise\r\nanatomical characters, had no sooner subdivided the old family of\r\n_Salmonidæ_ into his _Salmonidæ_, _Characini_, and _Scopelini_, than\r\nlight immediately spread over this field. Limited now to such fishes\r\nas, in addition to the mere general character of former _Salmonidæ_,\r\nhave a false gill on the inner surface of the operculum, the\r\n_Salmonidæ_ appeared at once as fishes peculiar to the northern\r\ntemperate region, occurring in immense numbers all around the Arctic\r\nSea, and running regularly up the rivers at certain seasons of the\r\nyear to deposit their spawn, while some live permanently in fresh\r\nwater. We have thus in the true _Salmonidæ_ actually a northern family\r\nof fishes, which, when found in more temperate regions, occurs there\r\nin clear mountain rivers, sometimes very high above the level of the\r\nsea, near the limits of perpetual snow, or in deep, cold lakes. That\r\nthis family is adapted to the cold regions is most remarkably\r\nexemplified by the fact that they all spawn late in the season, at the\r\napproach of autumn or winter, when frost or snow has reduced the\r\ntemperature of the water in which they live nearly to its lowest\r\nnatural point. The embryos grow within the egg very slowly for about\r\ntwo months before they are hatched; while fecundated eggs of some\r\nother families which spawn in spring and summer, give birth to young\r\nfishes a few days after they are laid. The _Salmonidæ_, on the\r\ncontrary, are born at an epoch when the waters are generally frozen\r\nup; that is at a period _when the maximum of temperature is at the\r\nbottom of the water_, where the eggs and young salmons remain among\r\ngravel, surrounded by a medium which scarcely ever rises above thirty\r\nor forty degrees.\r\n\r\nIt is plain from these statements, and from what we know otherwise of\r\nthe habits of this family, that there is no one upon the globe living\r\nunder more uniform circumstances, and nevertheless the species are\r\nextremely diversified, and we find peculiar ones in all parts of the\r\nworld, where the family occurs at all. Thus we find in Lake Superior\r\nspecies which do not exist in the course of the Mackenzie or\r\nSaskatchewan, and _vice versa_; others in the Columbia river which\r\ndiffer from those of the Lena, Obi, and Yenisei, while Europe again\r\nhas its peculiar forms.\r\n\r\nWhoever takes a philosophical view of the subject of Natural History,\r\nand is familiar with the above stated facts, will now understand why,\r\nnotwithstanding the specific distinctions there are between them, the\r\ntrouts and white fishes are so uniform all over the globe. It must be\r\nacknowledged that it is owing to the uniformity of the physical\r\ncondition in which they occur, and to which they are so admirably\r\nadapted by their anatomical structure, as well as by their instinct.\r\nRunning up and down the rapid rivers and mountain currents, leaping\r\neven over considerable waterfalls, they are provided with most\r\npowerful and active muscles; their tail is strong and fleshy, and its\r\nbroad basis indicates that its power is concentrated; it is like the\r\npaddle of the Indian who propels his canoe over the same waters. Their\r\nmouth is large, their jaw strong, their teeth powerful, to enable them\r\nto secure with ease the scanty prey with which they meet in these\r\ndeserts of cold water; and, nevertheless, though we cannot but be\r\nstruck by the admirable reciprocal adaptation between the structure of\r\nthe northern animals and the physical condition in which they live,\r\nlet us not mistake these adaptations for a consequence of physical\r\ncauses; let us not say that trouts resemble each other so much because\r\nthey originated under uniform conditions; let us not say they have\r\nuniform habits because there is no scope for diversity; let us not say\r\nthey spawn during winter, and rear their young under snow and ice,\r\nbecause at that epoch they are safer from the attacks of birds of\r\nprey; let us not say they are so intimately connected with the\r\nphysical world, because physical powers called them into existence;\r\nbut let us once look deeper, let us recognise that this uniformity is\r\nimparted to a wonderfully complicated structure: they are trouts with\r\nall their admirable structure, their peculiar back-bones, their\r\nornamented skull, their powerful jaws, their moveable eyes, with their\r\nthick, fatty skin and elegant scales, their ramified fin rays, and\r\nwith all that harmonious complication of structure which characterizes\r\nthe type of trouts, but over which a uniform robe, as it were, is\r\nspread in a manner not unlike an almost endless series of monotonous\r\nvariations upon one brilliant air, through the uniformity of which we\r\nstill detect the same melody, however disguised under the many\r\nundulations and changes of which it is capable.\r\n\r\nThe instincts of trouts are not more controlled by climate than those\r\nof other animals under different circumstances. They are only made to\r\nperform at a particular season, best suited to their organization,\r\nwhat others do at other times. If it were not so, I do not see why all\r\nthe different fishes, living all the year round in the same brook,\r\nshould not spawn at the same season, and finally be transformed into\r\none type; have we not, on the contrary, in this diversity under\r\nidentical circumstances, a demonstrative evidence that there is\r\nanother cause which has acted, and is still acting, in the production\r\nand preservation of these adaptations; a cause which endowed living\r\nbeings with the power of resisting the equalizing influence of uniform\r\nagents, though at the same time placing these agents and living beings\r\nunder definite relations to each other?\r\n\r\nThat trouts are not more influenced by physical conditions than other\r\nanimals is apparent from the fact that there are lakes of small extent\r\nand of most uniform features, in which two or three species of trout\r\noccur together, each with peculiar habits; one more migratory, running\r\nup rivers during the spawning season, &c., while the other will never\r\nenter running waters, and will spawn in quiet places near the shore;\r\none will hunt after its prey, while the other will wait for it in\r\nambuscade; one will feed upon fish, the other upon insects. Here we\r\nhave an example of species with different habits, where there would\r\nscarcely seem to be room for diversity in the physical condition in\r\nwhich they live; again, there are others living together in immense\r\nsheets of water, where there would seem to be ample scope for\r\ndiversity, among which we observe no great differences, as is the case\r\nbetween the Siscowet and the lake trout in the great northern lakes.\r\n\r\nIf these facts, statements, and inductions were not sufficient to\r\nsatisfy the reader of the correctness of my views, I would at once\r\nrefer to another material fact, furnished us by the family of\r\n_Salmonidæ_, namely, the existence of two essential modifications of\r\nthe true type of trouts, occurring everywhere together under the same\r\ncircumstances, showing the same general characters, back-bones, skull,\r\nbrain, composition of the mouth, intestines, gills, &c., &c., but\r\ndiffering in the size of the mouth, and in the almost absolute want of\r\nteeth, these groups being that of the white fishes, _Coregoni_, and\r\nthat of the true trouts, _Salmones_.\r\n\r\nNow, I ask, where is there, within the natural geographical limits of\r\ndistribution of _Salmonidæ_, a discriminating power between the\r\nphysical elements under which they live, which could have introduced\r\nthese differences?--a discriminating power which, allotting to all\r\ncertain characters, should have modified others to such an extent as\r\nto produce apparently different types under the same modification of\r\nthe general plan of structure. Why should there be, at the same time,\r\nunder the same circumstances, under the same geographical\r\ndistribution, white fishes with the habits of trouts,--spawning like\r\nthem in the fall, growing their young like them during winter,--if\r\nthere were not an infinitely wise Supreme Power, if there were not a\r\npersonal God, who, having first designed, created the universe, and\r\nmodelled our solar system, called successively, at different epochs,\r\nsuch animals into existence under the different circumstances\r\nprevailing over various parts of the globe, as would suit best this\r\ngeneral plan, according to which man was at last to be placed at the\r\nhead of creation? Let us remember all this, and we have a voice\r\nuttering louder and louder the cry which the external world equally\r\nproclaims, that there is a Creator, an intelligent and wise Creator,\r\nan omnipotent Creator of all that exists, has existed, and shall\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nTo come back to the _Salmonidæ_, I might say, that when properly\r\nstudied, there is not a species in nature, there is not a system of\r\norgans in any given species, there is not a peculiarity in the details\r\nof each of these systems, which does not lead to the same general\r\nresults, and which is not on that account equally worth our\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nA minute distinction between species is again, above all, the\r\nfoundation of our most extensive views of the whole, and of our most\r\nsublime generalizations. The species of _Salmonidæ_ call particularly\r\nour attention, from the minuteness of the characters upon which their\r\ndistinction rests. Their number in the north of this continent (North\r\nAmerica) is far greater than would be supposed from the mere\r\ninvestigation of those of the great lakes; but I shall, for the\r\npresent, limit myself to these.--_Agassiz, Lake Superior_, p. 366.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Results of Observations made by the_ Rev.

AIRY, Esq., Astronomer Royal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis important work, containing the earliest fruits of the Cape\r\nObservatory; and, while the first, at the same time some of the\r\nmost valuable contributions to Southern Astronomy,--has been\r\nreceived too late to allow us to do more than barely mention the\r\ntitles in the present number.\r\n\r\nWe are tempted, however, to extract the following short notice of\r\na remarkable meteor; because it tends to establish the connection\r\nso very much wanted between _shooting-stars_ on the one hand, and\r\n_meteorites_, or _meteor-stones_, on the other hand. The\r\nphenomenon in question had a something of the characteristics of\r\neach, but was more of the nature of the latter body, in which\r\ncase the mere fact of its appearing at the epoch of the\r\nshooting-stars, maybe considered in some degree significant of a\r\nconnection, more especially when confirmed by a second instance\r\nin another year; while, moreover, the November period of\r\nshooting-stars had not then been suspected; and these two\r\nobservations not only serve to confirm that period, but also to\r\ngive the retrogression of the nodes of the orbit, which has been\r\nsuspected.

R.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Discovery of the Great Lake \"Ngami\" of South Africa._\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographical discovery in Africa has even excited more interest than\r\nsimilar explorations in any other part of the world, and with\r\nreason--for, while it is one of the oldest and earliest peopled of\r\nlands; while the human race first attained there a high degree of\r\ncivilization, and a high degree of knowledge in the arts of peace and\r\nwar, of science and literature; with a grandeur in some things, and a\r\nskill in others never since equalled; yet it is now the country of all\r\nothers on the face of the globe concerning which we know least. In\r\nother continents there are undoubtedly parts not yet visited by\r\nEuropeans, or worthy of being more fully explored; but they are but\r\ninconsiderable spots compared with the almost boundless spaces of\r\nCentral Africa, where no foot of a white man has ever yet trod, and of\r\nthe greater part of which no semi-fabulous native accounts even have\r\never reached us. So that age after age the civilization of the\r\nenlightened nations of the world is gradually losing the hold which it\r\nonce had, at least along the northern shores of this vast continent;\r\nand the land of Ham is gradually reverting to a state of primeval\r\nwilderness, fenced in from all the rest of the world by the\r\nobstructive power of ignorance and position.\r\n\r\nAnd yet to no other part of the world has so continued a stream of\r\ngeographical explorers been poured, and is even pouring still; but\r\ninvariably either the deadly climate of the more fertile parts, or the\r\npassive but all-powerful impediments offered by the more desert\r\nportions, as well as the active opposition of natives, more savage and\r\nsanguinary than in any other part of the world, have invariably, by\r\ndeath or otherwise, put an untimely stop to the progress of the\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it must be highly encouraging to all\r\ninterested in the prosecutions of African geography, to hear that an\r\nactual and tangible discovery, and one of the most important kind for\r\nthe country in which it was effected, and for the prosecution of still\r\nfurther research, has just been made, in the fact of the Rev. David\r\nLivingston, a missionary of the London Society, having at least\r\nreached the great lake[87] of South Africa.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 87: This lake must not be confounded with the smaller\r\n     one, supposed by the Portuguese to exist on the coast of\r\n     Zanzibar.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance requires perhaps something more than mere notice, and\r\nto have more names mentioned in connection with it, from its being\r\npart of a general system of co-operation in which many have borne a\r\npart, and a very important and necessary part, towards the result\r\nwhich has been finally achieved; and at the very least, the name of\r\nthe Rev. Mr Moffat, the fellow missionary of Mr Livingston, deserves\r\nmention whenever the great lake is spoken of.\r\n\r\nIts existence had been suspected long since, and its discovery has\r\nbeen a constant theme of conversation for many years past at the Cape.\r\nBut yet the information of its whereabout, and size, and nature, were\r\nso very scanty, as to throw more doubt over the matter, the further\r\nthat it was examined into. Up to a very recent date, the only persons\r\nwho had ever been able within the colony to bear testimony to the fact\r\nof the existence of the great lake, from personal knowledge, were two\r\nyoung Bechuana brought down by D. A. Smith's expedition. They said,\r\nthat when they were children, and their tribe was flying from their\r\nenemies, they had been at one period close to the great lake; but,\r\nafter the closest cross-questioning, they left the matter more\r\nuncertain than ever, for from the length of time that their tribe was\r\nflying about in the desert in various directions, it would have been\r\nquite possible to have reached the sea either to the east or west, or\r\nthe colony to the south; and nothing certain could be made out as to\r\nthe mean resulting direction of the marching and countermarching.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, many were the ardent explorers who endeavoured to reach\r\nthis consummation, so greatly to be desired, amid the arid plains of\r\nSouth Africa. The last which started, and by far the most important of\r\nall that were ever organized in South Africa, was that of the Cape\r\nTown \"Association for Exploring Central Africa,\" and which started in\r\n1834, and returned in 1836. The party consisted of about seven\r\nEuropeans, as many waggons, and about thirty natives. The whole was\r\nunder the direction of Dr Andrew Smith, staff-surgeon, who had\r\nadmirably qualified himself for the command, by the experience of very\r\nmany years spent chiefly in the interior, and amongst the natives.\r\nAmong the members of the expedition, were an astronomer, well supplied\r\nwith instruments, and two artists, and Mr Charles Bell for landscape,\r\ntopography, and the manners and customs of the natives; and another,\r\nMr Ford, for the natural history department. Dr Smith took upon\r\nhimself especially the zoology, the ethnology, and geology; and the\r\nothers all contributed according to their powers, while the whole of\r\ntheir notes and journals of every kind were to be made over to the\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nThe expedition started in 1834, reached at length the Rev. Mr Moffat's\r\nresidence at Kuruman, then the outpost of the Missionary stations; by\r\nhim it was carried on further into the Zoolah country, to the abode of\r\nthe great chief Umsiligas. This seemed for various reasons the\r\nfurthest northing that the expedition could make, but a small party\r\nwent on in light marching order a little further, so as to be just\r\nable to say that 23° south latitude had actually been reached, before\r\nthe retrograde movement was begun.\r\n\r\nThe chief result of this expedition has been the publication of Dr A.\r\nSmith's beautiful and valuable zoological work, for the publication of\r\nwhich the government granted a sum of money.\r\n\r\nThe personal journal, the astronomical, geographical, geological, and\r\nmeteorological observations, have still to come; likewise Dr Smith's\r\nown observations touching the history, language, and other particulars\r\nof the various tribes of aborigines whom he met with; as well as Mr\r\nCharles Bell's inimitable drawings of the manners, customs, and\r\nappearances of the natives, and his expressive landscape scenery.\r\n\r\nThis degree or measure of success seemed to put the great lake further\r\noff than ever. Europeans despaired of their ever finding or beholding\r\nit, and none but traders and huntsmen subsequently traversed that part\r\nmerely of the road towards it, which the expedition did pass over;\r\nwhile the only scientific mission which has acted since in South\r\nAfrica, viz., that of Captain Sir J. E. Alexander, sent out by the\r\nRoyal Geographical Society of London,--hopeless, apparently, of doing\r\nanything by following Dr Smith's route, travelled and explored along\r\nthe western coast.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked long since by the North American Indians and other\r\naborigines, that the \"black-robe chiefs of the mission\" had always\r\npreceded the daring hunter and the crafty trader; and in no country\r\nhas the _preceding_ spirit of the missionaries been more evident than\r\nin South Africa. While pushing their stations continually further and\r\nfurther into the interior, they christianize and civilize the tribes\r\nas they go, and so leave the way paved and open behind them; a most\r\nimportant condition, when it is remembered what excessive distances a\r\ntraveller is there from his resources, and in what an impracticable\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSilently, but surely, has this operation been going on, until as it\r\nwere, almost by natural causes, a point has been reached, within which\r\nthe lake was but at a moderate distance. Starting from Mr Moffat's\r\nadvanced post of Kuruman, Mr Livingston had founded the station of\r\nKolobeng further north; and then it only required a small advance of\r\nmoney to pay the expense of the long contemplated journey. That sum\r\nwas furnished by two lay gentlemen, Messrs Murray and Oswell,--and\r\nthis great cynosure of South African geography, fell, in the ripeness\r\nof time, an easy prize.\r\n\r\nBut if we have this much to say for the effective lever which the\r\nmissionary system affords for geographical discovery, we cannot say so\r\nmuch as we should like in favour of the manner in which it has been\r\nworked in this instance, though it may be better than in the\r\ngenerality of cases.\r\n\r\nThere has been of late, it must be confessed, rather a decline of the\r\ntrue scientific spirit of geographical exploration; and men have too\r\nfrequently been contented with filling their books with accounts\r\nmerely of what they shot and what they eat; unable to give any more\r\nintelligent account of the country than the natives themselves.\r\n\r\nHardly any better, the Rev. Mr Rebman, who is supposed to have\r\ndiscovered in 5° S. lat., and 3 or 400 miles within the eastern coast\r\nof Africa, a mountain reaching above the limits of perpetual snow, and\r\nwhich may be the source of the Nile on the one hand, and of the rivers\r\nwhich feed the great lake Ngami on the other; for though he has been\r\ntwice to the mountains, yet he has sent home such puerile statements,\r\nthat the fact of its being snow at all which was _thought_ to have\r\nbeen seen, is now contested; and the height, latitude, longitude, &c.,\r\nof the mountain are quite uncertain.\r\n\r\nMr Livingston has done much better than this, though there is almost\r\neverything for the geographer, the botanist, &c., to do; but no fault\r\nis to be imputed to him, he had a higher object in view: we mention\r\nthe case so prominently here, rather to incite scientific men to go\r\nand do their part. We append Mr Livingston's letter to the end of this\r\nnotice, and will merely condense here the principal notabilia.\r\n\r\nThe latitude of the E. corner of the lake at its junction with the\r\neffluence the Zonga, was measured with a sextant, to be 20° 20´ S. The\r\nlongitude was estimated at 24° E., consequently about midway between\r\nthe E. and W. coasts. The height above the level of the sea was\r\nthermometrically determined at 2200 feet. The length and breadth were\r\nstated by the natives at 70 and 15 miles; Mr Livingston saw in the\r\nformer direction an uninterrupted horizon of water.\r\n\r\nThe feeder of the lake coming down from the north was described only\r\nby the natives; but its water being very clear, even during its annual\r\nrisings, and these being incomprehensible to the inhabitants of that\r\npart of the country, this course may be expected to be long, and not\r\nimprobably rising from a snowy mountain.\r\n\r\nThe effluent of the lake, the Zonga, was travelled along by Mr L. for\r\n300 miles; as the water was clear, the stream placid, the banks\r\nthickly clothed with beds of reeds, and the height above the sea 2200\r\nfeet,--it may be presumed that this river does _not_ communicate with\r\nthe ocean, and that it is gradually dissipated like other rivers there\r\nby evaporation and absorption.\r\n\r\nThe banyan, the palmyra, and the baobab, taking the place of the\r\ncactus, aloe, euphorbia and acacia, indicate the arrival in a better\r\nwatered country and a totally different botanical region than any\r\npreviously reached from the Cape.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the lake \"Bayeiye,\" seem to be a new race; their\r\nlanguage was unknown; and they possess several remarkable habits and\r\ncustoms totally at variance with the characteristics of all the South\r\nAfrican tribes, Hottentots, Bushmen, Caffres, Bechuana, Zoolahs, &c.,\r\nsouth of the tropics; as for instance, their having _canoes_, killing\r\nthe hippopotami with harpoons attached to ropes, and catching fish in\r\nnets.\r\n\r\nThe head of a fish which abounds in the lake, as well as a fearful fly\r\nwhich stings the oxen to death, have been sent home, and are declared\r\nto be new.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we have the pleasure of adding that although the\r\nGeographical Society could not exactly award with propriety their\r\nRoyal gold medal to discoveries in their science; made in a secondary\r\npoint of view, and but indifferently described, when it should be\r\nreserved for a Bruce or a Humboldt,--yet they have with great\r\nsatisfaction and alacrity awarded the value of the medal in money; and\r\nit is devoutly to be hoped that Mr L. may be spared to continue the\r\nexploration which he has thus auspiciously begun.               P. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Letter from the Rev. David Livingston, addressed to the\r\n  Rev. Arthur Tidman, Foreign Secretary, London Missionary Society._\r\n\r\n                      _Banks of the River Zonga, 3rd September 1849._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--I left my station, Kolobeng (situated 25° South lat.,\r\n  26 East long.), on the 1st of June last, in order to carry into\r\n  effect the intention, of which I had previously informed you, viz.\r\n  to open a new field in the North, by penetrating the great\r\n  obstacle to our progress, called the Desert, which, stretching\r\n  away on our West, North-West, and North, has hitherto presented an\r\n  insurmountable barrier to Europeans.\r\n\r\n  A large party of Griquas, in about thirty waggons, made many and\r\n  persevering efforts at two different points last year; but, though\r\n  inured to the climate, and stimulated by the prospect of much gain\r\n  from the ivory they expected to procure, want of water compelled\r\n  them to retreat.\r\n\r\n  Two gentlemen, to whom I had communicated my intention of\r\n  proceeding to the oft-reported lake beyond the desert, came from\r\n  England for the express purpose of being present at the discovery,\r\n  and to their liberal and zealous co-operation we are especially\r\n  indebted for the success with which that and other objects have\r\n  been accomplished. While waiting for their arrival, seven men came\r\n  to me from the Batavana, a tribe living on the banks of the lake,\r\n  with an earnest request from their chief for a visit. But the path\r\n  by which they had come to Kolobeng was impracticable for waggons;\r\n  so, declining their guidance I selected the more circuitous route,\r\n  by which the Bermangueato usually pass, and, having Bakwains for\r\n  guides, their self-interest in our success was secured by my\r\n  promising to carry any ivory they might procure for their chiefs\r\n  in my waggon; and right faithfully they performed their task.\r\n\r\n  When Sekhomi, the Bermangueato chief, became aware of our\r\n  intentions to pass into the regions beyond him, with true native\r\n  inhumanity he sent men before us to drive away all the bushmen and\r\n  Bakalihari from our route, in order that, being deprived of their\r\n  assistance in the search for water, we might, like the Griquas\r\n  above mentioned, be compelled to return. This measure deprived me\r\n  of the opportunity of holding the intercourse with these poor\r\n  outcasts I might otherwise have enjoyed. But through the good\r\n  providence of God, after travelling about 300 miles from Kolobeng,\r\n  we struck on a magnificent river on the 4th of July, and without\r\n  further difficulty, in so far as water was concerned, by winding\r\n  along its banks nearly 300 miles more, we reached the Batavana, on\r\n  the lake Ngami, by the beginning of August.\r\n\r\n  Previous to leaving this beautiful river on my return home, and\r\n  commencing our route across the desert, I feel anxious to furnish\r\n  you with the impressions produced on my mind by it and its\r\n  inhabitants, the Bakoba or Bayeiye. They are a totally distinct\r\n  race from the Bechuanas. They call themselves Bayeiye (or men),\r\n  while the term Bakoba (the name has somewhat of the meaning of\r\n  \"slaves,\") is applied to them by the Bechuanas. Their complexion\r\n  is darker than that of the Bechuanas; and, of 300 words I\r\n  collected of their language, only 21 bear any resemblance to\r\n  Sitchuana. They paddle along the rivers and lake in canoes\r\n  hollowed out of the trunks of single trees; take fish in nets made\r\n  of a weed which abounds on the banks; and kill hippopotami with\r\n  harpoons attached to ropes. We greatly admired the frank, manly\r\n  bearing of these inland sailors. Many of them spoke Sitchuana\r\n  fluently, and, while the waggon went along the bank, I greatly\r\n  enjoyed following the windings of the river in one of their\r\n  primitive craft, and visiting their little villages among the\r\n  reed. The banks are beautiful beyond any we had ever seen, except\r\n  perhaps some parts of the Clyde. They are covered, in general,\r\n  with gigantic trees, some of them bearing fruit, and quite new.\r\n  Two of the Baobab variety measured 70 to 76 feet in circumference.\r\n  The higher we ascended the river, the broader it became, until we\r\n  often saw more than 100 yards of clear deep water between the\r\n  broad belt of reed which grows in the shallower parts. The water\r\n  was clear as crystal, and as we approached the point of junction\r\n  with other large rivers _reported to exist_ in the North, it was\r\n  quite soft and cold. The fact that the Zonga is connected with\r\n  large rivers coming from the north awakens emotions in my mind,\r\n  which make the discovery of the lake dwindle out of sight. It\r\n  opens the prospect of a highway, capable of being quickly\r\n  traversed by boats, to a large section of well-peopled territory.\r\n\r\n  One remarkable feature in this river is its periodical rise and\r\n  fall. It has risen nearly three feet in height since our arrival,\r\n  and this is the dry season. That the rise is not caused by rains\r\n  is evident from the water being so pure. Its purity and softness\r\n  increased as we ascended towards its junction with the Tamunakle,\r\n  from which, although connected with the lake, it derives the\r\n  present increased supply. The sharpness of the air caused an\r\n  amazing keenness of appetite, at an elevation of little more than\r\n  2000 feet above the level of the sea (water boiled at 207½°\r\n  thermometer), and the reports of the Bayeiye, that the waters came\r\n  from a mountainous region, suggested the conclusion that the\r\n  increase of the water, at the beginning and middle of the dry\r\n  season, must be derived from melting snow.\r\n\r\n  All the rivers reported, to the north of this, have Bayeiye upon\r\n  them, and there are other tribes on their banks. To one of these,\r\n  after visiting the Batavana, and taking a peep at the broad part\r\n  of the lake, we directed our course; but the Batavana chief\r\n  managed to obstruct us, by keeping all the Bayeiye near the ford\r\n  on the opposite bank of the Zonga. African chiefs invariably\r\n  dislike to see strangers passing _them to tribes beyond_.\r\n  Sebitoane,--the chief who in former years saved the life of\r\n  Sechele our chief,--lives about ten days north-east of the\r\n  Batavana. The latter sent a present as a token of gratitude. This\r\n  would have been a good introduction; the knowledge of the\r\n  language, however, is the _best_ we can have. I endeavoured to\r\n  construct a raft, at a part which was only fifty or sixty yards\r\n  wide, but the wood, though sun-dried, was so heavy it sunk\r\n  immediately; another kind would not bear my weight, although a\r\n  considerable portion of my person was under water. I could easily\r\n  have swam across, and fain would have done it; but, landing\r\n  without clothes, and then demanding of the Bakoba the loan of a\r\n  boat, would scarcely be the thing for a messenger of peace, even\r\n  though no alligator met me in the passage. These and other\r\n  thoughts were revolving in my mind as I stood in the water,--for\r\n  most sorely do I dislike to be beaten,--when my kind and generous\r\n  friend Mr Oswell, with whom _alone_ the visit to Sebitoane was to\r\n  be made, offered to bring up a boat at his own expense from the\r\n  Cape, which, after visiting the chief, and coming round the north\r\n  end of the lake, will become missionary property. To him and our\r\n  other companion Mr Murray, I feel greatly indebted,--_for the\r\n  chief expense of the journey has been borne by them_. _They_ could\r\n  not have reached this point without my assistance; but, for the\r\n  aid they have rendered in opening up this field, I feel greatly\r\n  indebted; and, should any public notice be taken of this journey,\r\n  I shall feel obliged to the directors if they express my\r\n  thankfulness.\r\n\r\n  The Bayeiye or Bakoba listened to the statements made from the\r\n  Divine Word with great attention, and, if I am not mistaken,\r\n  seemed to understand the message of mercy delivered better than\r\n  any people to whom I have preached for the _first_ time. They have\r\n  invariably a great many charms in the villages; stated the name of\r\n  God in their language (without the least hesitation) to be\r\n  \"Oreeja;\" mentioned the name of the first man and woman, and some\r\n  traditionary statements respecting the flood. I shall not,\r\n  however, take these for certain, till I have more knowledge of\r\n  their language. They are found dwelling among the reed all round\r\n  the lake, and on the banks of all the rivers to the north.\r\n\r\n  With the periodical flow of the rivers great shoals of fish\r\n  descend. The people could give no reason for the rise of the\r\n  water, further than that a chief, who lives in a part of the\r\n  country in the north, called Mazzekiva, kills a man annually and\r\n  throws his body into the stream, after which the water begins to\r\n  flow.\r\n\r\n  The sketch which I enclose is intended to convey an idea of the\r\n  river Zonga and the lake Ngami. The name of the latter is\r\n  pronounced as if written with the Spanish ñ, the _g_ being\r\n  inserted to shew that the ringing sound is required. The meaning\r\n  is \"Great Water.\" The latitude, taken by a Sextant on which I can\r\n  fully depend, was 20° 20´ south, at the north-east extremity,\r\n  where it is joined by the Zonga; longitude about 24° east. _We do\r\n  not, however, know it with certainty._ We left our waggon near the\r\n  Batavana town, and rode on horseback about six miles beyond it to\r\n  the broad part. It gradually widens out into a Firth about 15\r\n  miles across, as you go south from the town, and in the\r\n  south-south-west presents a large horizon of water. _It is\r\n  reported_ to be about 70 miles in length, bends round to the\r\n  north-west, and there receives another river similar to the Zonga.\r\n  The Zonga runs to the north-east. The thorns were so thickly\r\n  planted near the upper part of this river, that we left all our\r\n  waggons standing about 180 miles from the lake, except that of Mr\r\n  Oswell, in which we travelled the remaining distance; but for this\r\n  precaution our oxen would have been unable to return. I am now\r\n  standing at a tribe of Bakurutse, and shall in a day or two\r\n  re-enter the desert.\r\n\r\n  The breadth marked is intended to show the difference between the\r\n  size of the Zonga, after its junction with the Tamunakle and\r\n  before it. The farther it runs east, the narrower it becomes. The\r\n  course is shewn by the arrow-heads. _The rivers not seen, but\r\n  reported by the natives_, are put down in dotted lines. The dotted\r\n  lines running north of the river and lake, shew the probable\r\n  course of the Tamunakle, and another river which falls into the\r\n  lake at its north-west extremity. The arrow-heads shew also the\r\n  direction of _its_ flow. At the part marked by the name of the\r\n  Chief Mosing it is not more than 50 or 60 yards in breadth, while\r\n  at 20° 7´ it is more than 100, and very deep.\r\n\r\n  The principal disease reported to prevail at certain seasons\r\n  appears, from the account of the symptoms the natives give, to be\r\n  pneumonia and not fever. When the wind rises to an ordinary\r\n  breeze, such immense clouds of dust arise from the numerous\r\n  dried-out lakes called salt-pans, that the whole atmosphere\r\n  becomes quite yellow, and one cannot distinguish objects more than\r\n  two miles off. It causes irritation in the eyes, and, as wind\r\n  prevails almost constantly at certain seasons, this impalpable\r\n  powder may act as it does among the grinders in Sheffield. We\r\n  observed cough among them, a complaint almost unknown at Kolobeng.\r\n  Musquitoes swarm in summer, and the Banyan and Palmyra give in\r\n  some parts an Indian cast to the scenery.\r\n\r\n                                         (Signed) DAVID LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          _A Brief Sketch of the Geology of the West Indies,\r\n         from_ Dr DAVY'S _Lectures on the Study of Chemistry,\r\n       drawn up chiefly from the Author's own Observations_.[88]\r\n             Communicated for the Philosophical Journal.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 88: Lectures on the Study of Chemistry, in connection\r\n     with the Atmosphere, the Earth and the Ocean, and Discourses on\r\n     Agriculture, with Introductions on the present State of the West\r\n     Indies, and on the Agricultural Societies of Barbados. By JOHN\r\n     DAVY, M.D., F.R.S., &c. London, Longmans. 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding lecture, I brought under your notice the antagonist\r\nand compensating, or correcting influences of animal life in\r\npreserving the uniformity of composition of the atmosphere. In the\r\nearth we witness influences of the like kind, as it were opposed to\r\neach other, and producing opposite effects. Water, in its operation,\r\naided by air, may be considered as destructive, wearing away rocks and\r\nmountains, and carrying their comminuted parts to lower levels, and\r\neven into the sea, to be buried in its depths. Fire may be considered\r\nas restorative; acting below the surface, it melts and also\r\nconsolidates, according to its degree of intensity, tending to\r\nreproduce crystalline rocks in one instance, and stratified in the\r\nother. Even when it appears most eminently to act according to our\r\nordinary notions of its operation as a devastating and destroying\r\nagent, for example, in the eruption of a volcano, the ashes which are\r\ndischarged into the atmosphere, and are widely scattered by the winds,\r\neven when they fall on the adjoining countries, may help to supply the\r\nplace of the old surface-materials, carried away by streams and\r\nfloods, and to renovate the soil with new elements of fertility. And\r\nacting in another form and manner, the same power which occasions\r\nvolcanic eruptions appears to be productive of another effect, viz.,\r\nthe gradual elevation of the bed of the sea, tending to the formation\r\nof new land, of which we seem to have examples in the extension of\r\ncertain coasts, and the appearance of rocks and dry land above the\r\nwaves, preceded by a gradual diminution of the water over the spots\r\nwhere these remarkable phenomena occur.\r\n\r\nOf most of the geological changes alluded to in the preceding remarks,\r\nthe West Indies afford well marked instances.\r\n\r\nFrom the continent of America are to be seen vast rivers flowing into\r\nthe sea, turbid with the detritus of the country through which they\r\nhave descended in a course of thousands of miles, and discolouring and\r\nfreshening the waters with which they mix at an extraordinary distance\r\nfrom land. Between their mouths on the coasts and their rapids in the\r\nboundary hills of the interior, immense level, or almost level tracts\r\noccur,--marsh, morass, and sandbank, neither land nor water, covered\r\nchiefly with aquatic plants,--tracts formed by deposits from the great\r\nrivers, and commonly of materials somewhat coarser and heavier than\r\nthose which are longer suspended and are carried out into the sea in\r\nconsequence of their greater fineness.\r\n\r\nIn many of the islands not only are there rocks to be seen evidently\r\nof volcanic origin--columnar basalt, trachyte, and many varieties of\r\ntufa, but also craters from whence eruptions have taken place, and in\r\nwhich the fires are hardly yet extinct that once acted, as is\r\nindicated by the hot steams and exhalations still proceeding from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in some of these islands, rocks of volcanic origin,\r\ncrystalline in their structure, and totally destitute of organic\r\nremains, are associated with others of a perfectly different\r\ncharacter, stratified and abounding in organic remains,--various\r\nspecies of sea shells and of coral; and it is worthy of notice, that,\r\nin one of the instances in which the appearance is best observed,\r\nviz., at Brimstone Hill, in St Christopher's, the volcanic rock,\r\nflanked by the stratified rock, and the latter--an aggregate of\r\nshells, coral, and calcareous marl, has its strata highly inclined,\r\ntilted up as it were by the former.\r\n\r\nOther islands, or parts of islands, occur, in which there are only\r\npartial volcanic traces, and these not so much of volcanic action and\r\ndisturbance on the spot, as of materials, such as ashes, thrown up by\r\nvolcanoes, and those distant ones. The island Barbados is an example.\r\nComposed in great parts of a calcareous aggregate, in which organic\r\nremains abound, it has very much the character, in its peculiar\r\nfeatures, of having been raised from the bed of the ocean (where it is\r\ncertain it was formed), by some mighty force, slowly acting, and\r\nwhich, it is probable, is acting still.\r\n\r\nNor is there wanting in these seas instances of islands, in which\r\nalmost every variety of formation is exemplified. Barbados, in its\r\nsmaller portion--the Scotland district, exhibits some interesting\r\nvarieties, such as beds of chalk abounding in the remains of\r\nmicroscopic animalcules, strata of sandstone, some siliceous, some\r\ncalcareous; the one without organic remains, containing, however,\r\ndeposits of coal and bitumen; the other--the latter having included in\r\nthem organic remains, and of a kind to connect them with the\r\ncalcareous rock of which the larger portion of the island is formed,\r\nfor instance, the spines of echini and the teeth of squali. The larger\r\nislands, Trinidad and Jamaica, Port Rico, and Cuba, yield examples,\r\nstill more in point. In Trinidad I am not aware that any volcano, or\r\ncrater of one, has been discovered, or any rocks evidently volcanic in\r\ntheir origin; but from the imperfectly crystalline rocks, destitute of\r\norganic remains and distinct stratification, to clays and marls, to\r\nmud eruptions or volcanoes as these are sometimes called, through\r\nlimestones and sandstones stratified, and containing organic remains,\r\na tolerably well-marked series may be traced. In the adjoining and\r\nsmaller island Tobago some of the same series are observable, but in a\r\nbroken manner, not a little interesting and instructive. There, highly\r\ncrystalline rocks, destitute of organic remains, are in juxtaposition\r\nwith others abounding in these remains; coral rock is even found\r\nresting on granite; and in another situation the latter rock is\r\ncontiguous to mica slate, in which quartz in mass is not of rare\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _On the Differences between Progressive, Embryonic, and Prophetic\r\n         Types in the Succession of Organized Beings through\r\n                the whole Range of Geological Times._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a great improvement in our zoological investigations when the\r\ndifferences in their relations, according to the various degrees of\r\naffinity or analogy which exist between animals, were pointed out, and\r\nsuccessively better understood. In earlier times, zoologists made no\r\ndistinction between the different relations which existed among\r\nanimals. Affinity and analogy, so dissimilar in their essential\r\ncharacters, were constantly mistaken one for the other; and upon the\r\npeculiarities which struck the observer most at first sight, animals\r\nwere brought together, sometimes upon the ground of true affinity,\r\nsometimes, also, upon the ground of close analogy; and though\r\ncomparative anatomy did put the mistakes arising from such confusion\r\nright, by showing that external appearances were sometimes deceptive,\r\nand that a more intimate knowledge of internal structure was necessary\r\nfully to understand the real relations between animals, there\r\nremained, nevertheless, a degree of uncertainty in many cases, as\r\nlong as the principles of affinities and of analogies were not\r\nfully distinguished. Every naturalist now knows that true\r\nrelationship--affinity--depends upon a unity in structure, however\r\ndiversified the forms may be under which their fundamental structure\r\nis displayed. For instance, the affinity of whales and the other\r\nmammalia was not understood before it was shown that, under the form\r\nof fishes, these animals had truly the same structure as the highest\r\n_vertebrata_.\r\n\r\nAgain, the forms of _cetacea_ exemplify the analogy there is between\r\nwhales and fishes. They are _related_ to mammalia; they are\r\n_analogous_ to fishes; they bear close affinity to the mammals which\r\nnurse their young with milk; they have rather close analogy to the\r\ngill-breathing fishes.\r\n\r\nSince the fossil animals which have existed during former periods upon\r\nthe surface of our globe, and which have successively peopled the\r\nocean and the dry land, have been more carefully studied than they\r\nwere at the beginning of these investigations; since they are no\r\nlonger considered as mere curiosities, but as the earlier\r\nrepresentatives of an order of things which has been gradually and\r\nsuccessively developed throughout the history of our globe, facts have\r\nbeen brought to light which now require a very careful examination,\r\nand will lead to a more complete understanding of the various\r\nrelations which exist between these extinct types and those which\r\nstill continue to live in our days. Upon close comparison of these\r\nfacts, I have been led to distinguish two sorts of relations between\r\nthe extinct animals, and those of our days, which seem to me to have\r\nbeen either overlooked or not sufficiently distinguished. Indeed, the\r\ngeneral results derived from Palæontological investigations, seem\r\nscarcely to have gone beyond showing that the animals of former ages\r\nare specifically and frequently also generically distinct from those\r\nof the present creation; and also to establish certain graduation\r\nbetween them, agreeing more or less with the degree of perfection\r\nwhich we recognise between the living animals according to their\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nIt is now pretty generally understood that fishes, which rank lowest\r\namong the _Vertebrata_, have existed alone during the oldest periods;\r\nthat the reptiles which, in the gradation of structure, rank next\r\nabove them, have followed at a later period; that still later the\r\nbirds, which, according to their anatomy, rank above reptiles, have\r\nnext made their appearance; and that mammalia, which stand highest,\r\nhave been introduced last, and even among these the lower families\r\nseem to have been more numerous, before the higher ones prevailed over\r\nthem. Man, at last, has been created, only after all other types had\r\nacquired their full development. These facts which, in such generality\r\nare fully exemplified in every country in the order of succession of\r\nthe different fossil characteristics of the various geological\r\ndeposits, shew plainly that a gradation really exists in this\r\nsuccession, and constitutes one of the most prominent characters of\r\nthe development of the animal kingdom as a whole.\r\n\r\nIf we investigate, however, this gradation, and the order of\r\nsuccession of animals more closely, we cannot but be struck with the\r\ndifferent relations which exist between the fossils and the living\r\nanimals. Many extinct types have been pointed out as characteristic of\r\ndifferent geological periods, which combine, as it were, peculiarities\r\nwhich at present are found separately in different families of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nI may mention as such, the _Ichthyosaur_, with their fish-like\r\nvertebræ, their dolphin or porpoise-like general form, and several\r\nspecial characters reminding us of their close relation to the\r\nCrocodilian reptiles; thus combining characters of different classes\r\nin the most extraordinary manner.\r\n\r\nAgain, the _Pterodactyli_, in which reptilian characters are combined\r\nwith peculiarities reminding us both of birds and bats.\r\n\r\nAgain, the large carnivorous  fishes of the coal period, combining\r\npeculiarities of the _Saurians_, with true fish characters; and so on.\r\n\r\nThese relations are of an entirely different kind from those which I\r\nhave pointed out between some of the older fossils and the early stage\r\nof growth of the living representatives of the same families.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the fossil fishes with a heterocercal tail, found below\r\nthe new red sandstone, down to the lowest deposits, reminds us of the\r\npeculiar termination of the vertebral column in all fish embryos of\r\nspecies living in the present period, to whatever family they may\r\nbelong, indicating a similarity of structure in the oldest\r\nrepresentative of this class, with the earliest condition of the germs\r\nof those animals in our days.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine whether we can properly understand the bearings of\r\nthese relations, and the meaning of such differences.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I have mentioned the gradual progress, which is\r\nobserved in the succession of the different classes of _Vertebrata_.\r\nThis progress is exemplified by a series of types which differ from\r\neach other, but which shew, when arranged in a series, a gradation\r\nwhich agrees in general with the structural gradation, which we may\r\nestablish upon anatomical evidence. For instance, the salamanders,\r\nwith their various forms, rank below the tailless _Batrachians_.\r\n\r\nAnd where we have a succession of those animals in the tertiary\r\ndeposits as they occur in various parts of Europe, we may fairly say\r\nthat the fossils form, in their succession, a series of progressive\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nAnother example may perhaps illustrate the point more fully. The\r\n_orthocera_ of the oldest periods precede the curved lituites, which,\r\nin their turn, are followed by the circumvolute nautilus. Here, again,\r\nwe have a natural gradation of a series of progressive types. Again,\r\namong _crinoids_, we find, in the older deposits, a variety of species\r\nresting upon a stem, while free crinoids begin to appear only during\r\nthe secondary deposit and prevail, in the present creation, over those\r\nattached to the soil. Here, again, we have a series of progressive\r\ntypes developed successively, which are apparently independent of each\r\nother and seem to bear no other relation to each than that arising\r\nfrom the general character of the group to which they belong. Such\r\ntypes exemplify simply in the groups to which they belong, a real\r\nprogress in the successive development of the peculiarities which\r\ncharacterise them as natural divisions among animals. Such forms I\r\nshall call _Progressive Types_.\r\n\r\nThe relations, however, which are exemplified in the oldest fishes, in\r\nthe ichthyosaurians, in the pterodactyls or in the megalosaurians,\r\nseem to me to be clearly of a different character, and to differ from\r\nsimple progressive types, inasmuch as those which appear earlier,\r\ncombine peculiarities which, at a later period, appear separately in\r\ndistinct forms. For instance, the reptilian characters which we\r\nrecognise in the sauroid fishes, are developed at a later period in\r\nanimals no longer belonging to the class of fishes, but constituting\r\nby themselves new types, provided with additional peculiarities which\r\nseparate them fully from the fishes in general, as well as from those\r\nfishes in which we recognise some relation to reptiles during a period\r\nwhen no reptile existed.\r\n\r\nAgain, the ichthyosaurians, though true reptiles appearing long after\r\nfishes had been called into existence, and during an early period of\r\nthe history of the reptiles, still shew their relation to fishes by\r\nthe character of their vertebral column, and foreshadow, as it were,\r\nin their form, the cetacea of later ages, as well as many forms of the\r\ngigantic saurians of the secondary period. The same may be said of the\r\npterodactyls, which are also true reptiles, but, in which the anterior\r\nextremity foreshadow peculiarities characteristic of birds and bats.\r\nSuch types I shall call _Prophetic Types_.\r\n\r\nTo an analytic mind the examination of the peculiarities of such\r\nanimals may foretell a higher progress of development, carried out in\r\nreal existence, only during a later period, even if he had never seen\r\nthe later ones; for in such types the germs of a future development\r\nmay be recognised, and upon close examination, truly referred to the\r\npeculiarities of other higher groups, even if the intermediate links\r\nremained unknown, which, however, as the matter now stands, can leave\r\nno doubt in our mind that these prophetic types really foreshadowed\r\nthat diversity of forms which has been created since they have gone\r\nby. We may also say that these prophetic types lay before us the\r\ncourse of thoughts which has been carried out in the plan of creation\r\nby the Supreme intelligence, who called them into existence in rich\r\norder of succession, and in so diversified relations. The recognition\r\nof this prophetic character of certain types of extinct animals is not\r\nonly important in a philosophical point of view; I have no doubt it\r\nwill ultimately and rapidly lead to a better, fuller, higher, and\r\ndeeper understanding of the various relations which exist between\r\nanimals. Let me at once point to some of these relations which might\r\nnever have been understood but for this appreciation.\r\n\r\nAmong Crinoids, we have not only progressive types, as I have already\r\nquoted, but we have also prophetic ones. The Cystidæ are truly\r\nprophetic of the Echini proper. I may only mention the genus\r\nEchinocrinus to shew the link.\r\n\r\nThe Pentremites, again, are the prophetic type foreshadowing the\r\nstar-fishes. And often in subordinate groups we may find such close\r\nrelations between genera of the same minor divisions; such, for\r\ninstance, as the genus Encrinus, in which the genera Apiocrinus and\r\nPentacrinus, are simultaneously foreshadowed. Perhaps, in this case, a\r\ndistinction might be introduced between truly prophetic types and\r\nsynthetic types, in which the characters of later groups are rather\r\nmore combined than really foreshadowed.\r\n\r\nAs for the relation between older types and the embryos of the living\r\nrepresentatives of the same families which are so extensively observed\r\nin almost all groups of the animal kingdom, which have existed during\r\nearlier periods, it may best be expressed if we call those fossils\r\nwhich exemplify, in full grown animals, forms which exist at present\r\nonly in the earliest stages of growth of our living animals,\r\n_Embryonic Types_, in counterdistinction from the progressive types,\r\nand from the prophetic types. These embryonic types may be purely\r\nsuch, or they may be at the same time either progressive types, or\r\neven prophetic types. I shall call purely embryonic types those in\r\nwhich we recognise peculiarities characteristic of the embryo of the\r\nsame family. For instance, the older Sauroids, which have the upper\r\nlobe of the tail prolonged, or the common Crinoids provided with a\r\nstem, which resemble the young Comatulæ, &c., &c. I shall distinguish,\r\nas progressive embryonic types, those in which we recognise\r\nsimultaneously a relation to the embryo of the same family, when they\r\nform besides a link in the natural chain of progressive development.\r\nSuch, for instance, as the oldest Salamanders, or the earliest\r\nSirenoid Pachyderm. Finally, I shall call prophetic embryonic types\r\nthose in which we have embryonic characters, combined with the\r\npeculiarities which stamp the type as a prophetic one, such, for\r\ninstance, as the Echinoid and Asteroid Crinoids of the former ages.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these different types may thus present complications of\r\ntheir character, or appear more or less pure and typical, goes further\r\nto shew how deeply diversified the plan of creation is, and how many\r\nrelations should be simultaneously understood before we are prepared\r\nto have a full insight into the plan of creation. There we see one\r\ntype forming simply, and alone, the first link of a progressive\r\nseries. There we see another which foreshadows types, which appear\r\nisolate afterwards. There we see a third, which, in its full\r\ndevelopment, exemplifies a state which is transient only in higher\r\nrepresentatives of the same family. And then, again, we see these\r\ndifferent relations running into each other, and reminding us that,\r\nhowever difficult it may be for us to see at one glance all this\r\ndiversity of relations, there is, notwithstanding, an intelligence\r\nwhich not only conceived these various combinations, but called them\r\ninto real existence in a long succession of ages.--_L. Agassiz in the\r\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science_, August 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     _On a new Analogy in the Periods of Rotation of the Primary\r\n  Planets discovered by Daniel Kirkwood of Pottsville, Pennsylvania._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the recent meeting of the Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, an announcement was made, which, if it is found to be\r\ncorrect, will be regarded as relating to one of the most important\r\ndiscoveries which have been made in astronomy for years. It is no less\r\nthan a new law of the solar system, closely resembling those of\r\nKepler, which form the groundwork of many of the problems of\r\nastronomy. Mr S. C. Walker read to the Association a letter from Mr\r\nDaniel Kirkwood, of Pottsville, Pa., the discoverer of this new law,\r\nfrom which we make some extracts, omitting all that refers to the\r\nhigher branches of mathematics.\r\n\r\n\"While we have in the law of Kepler a bond of mutual relationship\r\nbetween the planets, as regards their revolutions around the sun, it\r\nis remarkable that no law regulating their rotations on their axes has\r\never been discovered. For several years I have had little doubt of the\r\nexistence of such a law in nature, and have been engaged, as\r\ncircumstances would permit, in attempting its development. I have at\r\nlength arrived at results, which, if they do not justify me in\r\nannouncing the solution of this important and interesting problem,\r\nmust at least be regarded as astonishing coincidences.\"\r\n\r\nAfter stating some equations, he gives the following tables as the\r\ndata on which he has proceeded:--\r\n\r\n  +---------+---------------+-------------+-----------+----------------+\r\n  |         |   Mean dist.  |             |   Square  |No. of rotations|\r\n  |Planet's |  from the sun |    Mars.    |   root of |   in one sid.  |\r\n  | name.   |   in miles.   |             |    Mars.  |     period.    |\r\n  +---------+---------------+-------------+-----------+----------------+\r\n  |Mercury, |    36,814,000 |     277,000 |    526·3  |      87·63     |\r\n  |Venus,   |    68,787,000 |   2,463,836 |  1·569·6  |     230·90     |\r\n  |Earth,   |    95,103,000 |   2,817,409 |  1·678·5  |     366·25     |\r\n  |Mars,    |   144,908,000 |     392,735 |    626·7  |     669·60     |\r\n  |Jupiter, |   494,797,000 | 953,570,222 | 30·879·8  |  10·471·00     |\r\n  |Saturn,  |   907,162,000 | 284,738,000 | 16·874·1  |  24·620·00     |\r\n  |Uranus,  | 1,824,290,000 |  35,186,000 |  5·931·5  |                |\r\n  +---------+---------------+-------------+-----------+----------------+\r\n\r\nFrom these data he deduces the following law:--\"The square of the\r\nnumber of a primary planet's days in its year, is as the cube of the\r\ndiameter of its sphere of attraction in the nebular hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\n\"The points of equal attraction between the planets severally (when in\r\nconjunction), are situated as follows:--\r\n\r\n                               Miles from the   Miles from the\r\n                                  former.          latter.\r\n\r\n  Between Mercury and Venus,      8,029,600       23,943,400\r\n     \"    Venus and the Earth,   12,716,600       13,599,400\r\n     \"    Earth and Mars,        36,264,600       13,540,400\r\n     \"    Jupiter and Saturn,   266,655,000      145,710,000\r\n     \"    Saturn and Uranus,    678,590,000      238,538,000\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen from the above, that the diameter of the earth's\r\nsphere of attraction is 49,864,000 miles. Hence the diameters of the\r\nrespective spheres of attraction of the other planets, according to my\r\nempirical law, will be found to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n                  Diameter of sphere\r\n                    of Attraction.\r\n  Mercury,            19,238,000\r\n  Venus,              36,660,000\r\n  Mars,               74,560,000\r\n  Jupiter,           466,200,000\r\n  Saturn,            824,300,000\r\n\r\n\"The volumes of the sphere of attraction of Venus, Mars, and Saturn in\r\nthis table, correspond with those obtained from the preceding one;\r\nthat of Mars extending 61,000,000 miles beyond his orbit, or to the\r\ndistance of 206,000,000 miles from the sun. This is about 2,000,000 or\r\n3,000,000 miles less than the mean distance of Flora, the nearest\r\ndiscovered asteroid. That of Mercury extends about 11,000,000 miles\r\nwithin the orbit; consequently, if there be an undiscovered planet\r\ninterior to Mercury, its distance from the Sun, according to my\r\nhypothesis, must be less than 26,000,000 miles. Jupiter's sphere of\r\nattraction extends only about 200,000,000 of miles within his orbit,\r\nand leaving 89,000,000 miles for the asteroids. It is only in the most\r\ndistant portion of this space, where small bodies would be likely to\r\nbe detected, that none have yet been discovered.\"\r\n\r\nMr Kirkwood then modestly concludes:--\r\n\r\n\"The foregoing is submitted to your inspection with much diffidence.\r\nAn author, you know, can hardly be expected to form a proper estimate\r\nof his own performance. When it is considered, however, that my\r\nformula involves the distances, masses, annual revolutions, and axial\r\nrotations of all the primary planets in the system, I must confess I\r\nfind it difficult to resist the conclusion, that the law is founded in\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this letter had been read, Mr Walker said, that, induced by the\r\nimportance of the subject, he had at once proceeded to verify the data\r\nand conclusions of Mr Kirkwood, and had found that there was nothing\r\nin them requiring modification, except, perhaps, the substitution of\r\nsome more recent values for the masses of Mercury and Uranus. This\r\ntheory and that of Laplace, with reference to nebulæ, mutually\r\nstrengthen each other; although the latter has been a mere\r\nsupposition, while the former rests upon a mathematical basis. In a\r\nlater letter, which was also read, Mr Kirkwood says that he has\r\npursued this subject for the last ten years, it having been first\r\nsuggested to him by the nebular hypothesis, which he thought could be\r\nestablished by some law of rotation.\r\n\r\nMr Walker then entered into a lengthened examination of the data on\r\nwhich the law rests, and seemed to come to the conclusion, that, as\r\nfar as we know at present, everything is in favour of the truth of the\r\nlaw, except that it requires the assumption of another planet between\r\nJupiter and Mars.\r\n\r\nMr Walker closed his examination by saying, \"We may, therefore,\r\nconclude, that, _whether Kirkwood's analogy is or is not the\r\nexpression of a physical law, it is, at least, that of a physical fact\r\nin the mechanism of the universe_. The quantity on which the analogy\r\nis based has such immediate dependence upon the nebular hypothesis,\r\nthat it lends strength to the latter, and gives new plausibility to\r\nthe presumption that this, also, is a fact in the past history of the\r\nsolar system.\r\n\r\n\"Such, then, is the present state of the question. Thirty-six elements\r\nof nine planets (four being hypothetical) appear to harmonize with\r\nKirkwood's analogy in all the four fundamental equations of condition\r\nfor each planet.\r\n\r\n\"To suppose that so many independent variable quantities should\r\nharmonize together by accident, is a more strained construction of the\r\npremises than the frank admission that they follow a law of nature.\r\n\r\n\"If, in the course of time, the hypotheses of Laplace and Kirkwood\r\nshould be found to be the laws of nature, they will throw new light on\r\nthe internal organization of the planets in their present, and in any\r\nmore primitive, state through which they may have passed.\r\n\r\n\"For instance, we may compute the distance from the centre at which\r\nany planet must have received its projectile force, in order to\r\nproduce, at the same time, its double movement of translation and\r\nrotation.\r\n\r\n\"If the planet, in a more primitive state, existed in the form of a\r\nring revolving round the Sun, having its present orbit for that of the\r\ncentre of gravity of the ring, the momentum of rotation must, by\r\nvirtue of the principle of conservation of movement, have existed in\r\nsome form in the ring. It is easy to perceive that this momentum is\r\nprecisely the amount which must be distributed among the particles of\r\nthe ring, in order to preserve to all the condition of dynamical\r\nequilibrium, while those of each generating surface of the ring were\r\nwheeling round with the same angular velocity.\r\n\r\n\"If the planets have really passed from the shape of a revolving ring\r\nto their present state, the prevalence of Kirkwood's analogy shews a\r\nnice adaptation of parts in every stage of the transition.\r\n\r\n\"If the primitive quantity of coloric (free and latent) had undergone\r\na very great change beyond that now indicated in the cooling of their\r\ncrusts; if the primitive quantity of movement of rotation had been\r\ndifferent from its actual value for any planet; if the law of\r\nelasticity of particles for a given temperature and distance from each\r\nother varied from one planet to another in the primitive or present\r\nstate; in either of these cases, the analogy of Kirkwood might have\r\nfailed. As it is, no such failure is noticed; we are authorised,\r\ntherefore, to conclude, that the primitive quantity of coloric, the\r\nlaw of elasticity, the quantity of movement of rotation, the past and\r\npresent radii of percussion, the primitive diameter of the generating\r\nsurface of the rings, and the present dimensions and density of the\r\nplanets, have been regulated by a general law, which has fulfilled for\r\nall of them the four fundamental conditions of Kirkwood's hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\"We may extend the nebular hypothesis and Kirkwood's analogy to the\r\nsecondary system. If they are laws of nature, they must apply to both.\r\nIn the secondary systems, the day and month are the same. This fact\r\nhas remained hitherto unexplained. Lagrange shewed that if these\r\nvalues were once nearly equal, a libration sets in round a state of\r\nperfect equality; but he offered no conjecture as to the cause of the\r\nprimitive equality. On the nebular and Kirkwood's hypothesis, it would\r\nonly be necessary that, upon the breaking up of the ring, the\r\nprimitive diameter of the generating figure and law of relative\r\ndensity of layers should be preserved.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Peirce, whose opinions will probably be regarded as of more\r\nvalue on such a subject than that of any other man in this\r\ncountry,--especially since his successful discussion with\r\nLeverrier,--remarked, that Kirkwood's analogy was the only discovery\r\nof the kind since Kepler's time that approached near to the character\r\nof his three physical laws. Bode's law, so called, was at best only an\r\nimperfect analogy. Kirkwood's analogy was more comprehensive, and more\r\nin harmony with the known elements of the system. The diameter of the\r\nsphere of attraction, a fundamental element in this analogy, now for\r\nthe first time gave an appearance of reality to Laplace's nebular\r\nhypothesis which it never had before. The positive testimony in its\r\nfavour would now outweigh the former negative evidence in the case,\r\nhowever strong it may have been. It follows at least from Kirkwood's\r\nanalogy, that the planets were dependent upon each other, and\r\ntherefore connected in their origin, whatever may have been the form\r\nof the connection, whether that of the nebular hypothesis, or some\r\nother not yet imagined.\r\n\r\nAt a later period of the meeting, M. B. A. Gould junior, stated that\r\nhe had gone through the necessary calculations, using different\r\nquantities, and had come to the same conclusions as Mr Walker. He\r\nexpressed his opinion, that at some future day the world will \"speak\r\nof Kepler and Kirkwood as the discoverers of great planetary laws.\"\r\n\r\nThe members generally expressed the opinion, that Laplace's nebular\r\nhypothesis, from its furnishing one of the elements of Kirkwood's law,\r\nmay now be regarded as an established fact in the past history of the\r\nsolar system.--_American Annual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 335.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Such, at least, is rather a representation of American opinions\r\nthan of our own. We are inclined to compare it more with Bode's law\r\nthan with Kepler's. The former is a mere arithmetical accident,\r\napplying indifferently well to a portion only of the planets, and\r\nhaving nothing of reason to advance for its establishment. The latter\r\nare essential parts of mechanics and gravitation, and precisely and\r\nperfectly, and necessarily true, not only in every part of the solar\r\nsystem, but through the whole universe.\r\n\r\nThe fact of axial rotations being the groundwork of Kirkwood's analogy\r\nseems fatal to it, for gravitation takes no more account of the time\r\nof rotation of a planet than it does of specific gravity; all\r\ncalculations of the movement of the body in space are equally\r\nindependent of the one and the other.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the degree of accuracy with which it may be\r\nfound to apply is the only saving clause. Messrs Walker and Gould\r\ninvestigating the subject independently, and with better constants of\r\nmass and distance than Kirkwood had been able to procure, declare that\r\nit appears _perfectly_! We are sorry that the late hour at which we\r\nhave received this paper has prevented us either from giving it in\r\nfull, or from testing the theory rigidly.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, according to Kirkwood's theory, in order to\r\ncompute the time of axial rotations of any planet, it is necessary to\r\nhave its mass and mean distance, together with the same quantities for\r\nthe planets on either side of it. Now, these quantities are only\r\nobtainable for Venus, the Earth, Saturn, and Uranus (a planet being\r\nlost between Mars and Jupiter); and the rotation of Uranus not having\r\nbeen obtained as yet, there remains only the three first by which the\r\ntheory can be tested.\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary calculation which we have instituted, we do not find\r\nthe results so accordant as we had been led to expect, but still\r\nsufficiently so to give a certain probability of the approach to\r\ntruth, in a case where the quantity had not been observed.\r\n\r\nViewed in this light, some very interesting results are obtained.\r\n\r\n_1st_, The idea entertained by Bianchini and other observers, that the\r\nrotation of Venus is nearly 24 times as long as hitherto supposed, is\r\nutterly untenable.\r\n\r\n_2d_, The time of rotation of Uranus, a quantity never yet observed\r\n(but doubtless capable of being observed by a telescope of Lord\r\nRosse's calibre, _removed to a table-land in a tropical country_) is\r\ngiven; and appears so very different from any other yet observed,\r\nespecially so from those of its neighbours Saturn and Jupiter, being =\r\n1·396779, earth's = 0·997270 (sidereal rotation in mean solar days.)\r\n\r\n_3d_, Knowing the rotations of Jupiter and Mars, we may supply, by\r\nusing the analogy conversely, the _diameters of their spheres of\r\nattraction_, and thus get at the elements of the lost planet between\r\nMars and Jupiter, and these appear to be:--mean distance = 2·9085111\r\n(earth unity), mass in terms of Sun 1/1353240, sidereal rotation in\r\nearth's mean solar days 2·406104, and diameter of sphere of attraction\r\n0·830951, in terms of earth's distance. The size is thus a little\r\nlarger than Mars. The slowness of rotation is remarkable, especially\r\nin the case of a planet which is supposed since to have burst into\r\npieces: the Americans have called it Kirkwood.                  P.

Lavini of\r\nTurin, in a letter to the editor of _L'Institut_ at Paris, makes the\r\nfollowing curious observation, which, if confirmed, may prove to be of\r\ngreat importance:--\"When there is a fog between two corresponding\r\nstations, so that the one station can with difficulty be seen from the\r\nother, if the observer passes a coloured glass between his eye and the\r\neye-piece of his telescope, the effect of the fog is very sensibly\r\ndiminished, so that frequently the signals from the other station can\r\nbe very plainly perceived; when, without the coloured glass, even the\r\nstation itself is invisible. The different colours do not all produce\r\nthis effect in the same degree, the red seeming to be the best. Those\r\nwho have good sight prefer the dark-red, while those who are\r\nshort-sighted like the light-red better. The explanation of this\r\neffect seems to depend upon the fact, that the white colour of the fog\r\nstrikes too powerfully upon the organ of sight, especially if the\r\nglass have a somewhat large field. But by the insertion of the\r\ncoloured glass, the intensity of the light is much diminished by the\r\ninterception of a part of the rays, and the observer's eye is less\r\nwearied, and, consequently, distinguishes better the outlines of the\r\nobject observed.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Ozone._--Chemists are not yet fully agreed concerning the nature\r\nor production of this singular substance, ozone. To Schonbein and\r\nWilliamson we are indebted for most of our knowledge concerning it.\r\nThe latter has supposed it to be a compound of oxygen and hydrogen,\r\nfrom the fact, that, when the ozone completely freed from moisture was\r\npassed over ignited copper, water was produced. De la Rive produced it\r\nby passing a current of electricity through pure dry oxygen gas\r\ncontained in a receiver. It is also obtained in large quantities by\r\npassing oxygen gas over moistened phosphorous, and afterwards drying\r\nit. Thus prepared, it is a powerful chemical agent, possesses\r\nbleaching properties, oxidises the metals with rapidity, and destroys\r\nIndia-rubber. The hydrogen acids of sulphur are decomposed by it,\r\nwater being formed by uniting with the hydrogen of the acid, and\r\nsulphur being set free. Professor Horsford has observed that ozone,\r\nsubjected to a heat of 130° Fah., entirely loses its properties.\r\nOzone, like chlorine, precipitates iodine, colouring a solution of\r\niodide of potassium, and starch a deep blue colour. The peculiar\r\nsmell, prevalent in the vicinity of objects struck by lightning, as\r\nwell as that occasioned by the excitation of an electrical machine,\r\nand by the striking of two pieces of silica together, it is believed\r\nto be occasioned by ozone.--_Editors._--_Annual of Scientific\r\nDiscovery_, p. 219.\r\n\r\n_Method of Determining the Amount of Ozone in the Atmosphere._--At the\r\nmeeting of the American Association, an instrument for determining the\r\nrelative quantity of ozone in the air was presented by Professor\r\nHorsford. It consisted of a tube, containing at one end a plug of\r\nasbestus, moistened with a solution of iodide of potassium and starch.\r\nThis plug within the tube, attached to an aspirator, would, as air\r\npassed over it, become blue. If much water flowed from the aspirator,\r\nand of course much air flowed over the asbestus before it became blue,\r\nthe quantity of ozone indicated would be small. If but little water\r\nflowed (and this could be measured), the quantity of ozone indicated\r\nwould be greater. The quantities of ozone would be inversely as the\r\nvolumes of air passing through the tube before blueness is\r\nproduced.--_Annual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 219.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HYDROGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n3. _On the Phenomena of the Rise and Fall of the Waters of the\r\nNorthern Lakes of America._--At a meeting of the American Academy,\r\nFebruary 1849, Mr Foster, of the United States Mineral Survey in the\r\nNorth-west Territory, presented the result of some observations,\r\nundertaken with a view of determining whether the waters of the\r\nnorthern lakes are subject to any movements corresponding to tidal\r\naction. The result of these observations had convinced him that these\r\nwaters do not rise and fall at stated periods, corresponding to the\r\nebb and flow of the tide, but are subject to extraordinary risings,\r\nwhich are independent of the influence of the sun and moon. These\r\nrisings attracted the attention of the earliest _voyageurs_ in these\r\nregions. Charlevoix, who traversed the lakes nearly a century ago,\r\nsays, in reference to Lake Ontario:--\"I observed that in this lake\r\nthere is a sort of reflux and flux almost instantaneous; the rocks\r\nnear the banks being covered with water, and uncovered again several\r\ntimes in the space of a quarter of an hour, even if the surface of the\r\nlake was very calm, with scarce a breath of air. After reflecting some\r\ntime on this appearance, _I imagined it was owing to springs at the\r\nbottom of the lake, and to the shock of their currents with those of\r\nthe rivers which fall into them from all sides, and thus produce those\r\nintermitting motions_.\" The same movements were noticed by Mackenzie\r\nin 1789; by an expedition under Colonel Bradstreet in 1764; on Lake\r\nErie in 1823, and at various later periods. In the summer of 1834, an\r\nextraordinary retrocession of the waters of Lake Superior took place\r\nat the outlet of Sault St Marie. The river at this place is nearly a\r\nmile wide, and in the distance of a mile falls 18·5 feet. The\r\nphenomena occurred about noon. The day was calm, but cloudy. The water\r\nretired suddenly, leaving the bed of the river bare, except for a\r\ndistance of thirty rods, and remained so for nearly an hour. Persons\r\nwent out and caught fish in pools formed in the depressions of the\r\nrocks. The return of the waters is represented as having been very\r\ngrand. They came down like an immense surge, and so sudden was it,\r\nthat those engaged in catching fish had barely time to escape being\r\noverwhelmed. In the summer of 1847, on one occasion the water rose and\r\nfell at intervals of about fifteen minutes during an entire afternoon.\r\nThe variation was from twelve to twenty inches, the day being calm and\r\nclear; but the barometer was falling. Before the expiration of\r\nforty-eight hours, a violent gale set in. At Copper harbour, the ebb\r\nand flow of the water through narrow inlets and estuaries has been\r\nrepeatedly noticed when there was not a breath of wind on the lake.\r\nSimilar phenomena occur on several of the Swiss lakes. Professor\r\nMather, who observed the barometer at Copper harbour during one of\r\nthese fluctuations, remarks:--\"As a general thing, fluctuations in the\r\nbarometer accompanied fluctuations in the level of the water; but\r\nsometimes the water-level varied rapidly in the harbour, while no such\r\nvariations occurred in the barometer at the place of observation.\"\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, these variations in the water-level indicate the\r\napproach of a storm, or a disturbed state of the atmosphere. The\r\nbarometer is not sufficiently sensitive to indicate the sudden\r\nelevations and depressions, recurring, as they often do, at intervals\r\nof ten or twelve minutes; and the result of observations at such time\r\nmay, in some degree, be regarded as negative. Besides, it may not\r\nunfrequently happen, that, while effects are witnessed at the place of\r\nobservation, the cause which produced them may be so far removed as\r\nnot to influence the barometer. We are, therefore, led to infer that\r\nthese phenomena result, not from the prevalence of the winds acting on\r\nthe water, accumulating it at one point and depressing it at others,\r\nbut from sudden and local changes in the pressure of the atmosphere,\r\ngiving rise to a series of barometric waves. The water, conforming to\r\nthe laws which govern two fluids thus relatively situated, would\r\naccumulate where the pressure was the least, and be displaced where it\r\nwas the greatest. It has been remarked by De la Beche, that a sudden\r\nimpulse given to the particles of water, either by a suddenly\r\nincreased or diminished pressure, would cause a perpendicular rise or\r\nfall, in the manner of a wave, beyond the height or depth strictly due\r\nto the mere weight itself. The difference in the specific gravity of\r\nthe water of the lakes and the ocean may cause these changes to be\r\nmore marked in the former than in the latter.--_American Annual of\r\nScientific Discovery_, p. 245.\r\n\r\n4. _Water Thermometer._--Lieut. Maury states that he has been very\r\nmuch assisted in developing his theory of winds and currents by means\r\nof the thermometer used by some vessels for determining the\r\ntemperature of the water. It was by means of these observations on the\r\ntemperature of the water that he was enabled to prove that, off the\r\nshores of South America, between the parallels of 35° and 40° south,\r\nthere is a region of the ocean in which the temperature is as high as\r\nthat of our own Gulf stream, while in the middle of the ocean, and\r\nbetween the same parallels, the temperature of the water is not so\r\ngreat by 22°. Now, this very region is noted for its gales, being the\r\nmost stormy that the as yet incomplete charts of the South Atlantic\r\nindicate. Lieut. Maury says, however, that very few navigators make\r\nuse of the water thermometer, so that he has experienced some\r\ninconvenience in his undertaking. He is the more surprised at this,\r\nfrom the fact that New York owes much of her commercial importance to\r\na discovery that was made by this thermometer. At the time when Dr\r\nFranklin discovered the Gulf Stream, Charleston had more foreign trade\r\nthan New York and all the New England States together. Charleston was\r\nthen the half-way house between New and Old England. When a vessel, in\r\nattempting to enter the Delaware or Sandy Hook, met a north-west gale\r\nor snow storm, as at certain seasons she is apt to do, instead of\r\nrunning off for a few hours into the Gulf Stream to thaw and get warm,\r\nas she now does, she used to put off for Charleston or the West\r\nIndies, and there remained till the return of spring before making\r\nanother attempt. A beautiful instance this of the importance and\r\nbearings of a single fact, elicited by science from the works of\r\nnature.--_Annual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 160.\r\n\r\n5. _On the Falls of Niagara._--If we follow the chasm cut by the\r\nNiagara river, down to Lake Ontario, we have a succession of strata\r\ncoming to the surface of various character and formation. These strata\r\ndip south-west or towards the Falls, so that, in their progress to\r\ntheir present position, the Falls have had a bed of very various\r\nconsistency. Some of these strata, as the shales and medina sandstone,\r\nare very soft, and, when they formed the edge of the Fall, it probably\r\nhad the character of rapids; but, wherever it comes to an edge of hard\r\nrock, with softer rock-beds below, the softer beds, crumbling away,\r\nleave a shelf projecting above, and then the fall is perpendicular.\r\nSuch is the case at present; the hard Niagara limestone overhangs in\r\n_tables_ the soft shales underneath, which at last are worn away to\r\nsuch an extent as to undermine the superincumbent rocks. Such was also\r\nthe case at Queenston, where the Clinton group formed the edge, with\r\nthe medina sandstone below. This process has continued from the time\r\nwhen the Niagara fell directly into Lake Ontario to the present time,\r\nand will continue so long as there are soft beds underneath hard ones;\r\nbut, from the inclination of the strata, this will not always be the\r\ncase. A time will come when the rock below will also be hard. Then,\r\nprobably, the Falls will be nearly stationary, and may lose much of\r\ntheir beauty from the wearing away of the edge rendering it an\r\ninclined plane. I do not think the waters of Lake Erie will ever fall\r\ninto Lake Ontario without any intermediate cascade. The Niagara shales\r\nare so extensive that possibly, at some future time, the river below\r\nthe cascade may be enlarged into a lake, and thus the force of the\r\nfalling water diminished; but the whole process is so slow, that no\r\naccurate calculations can be made. The Falls were probably larger, and\r\nstationary for a longer time at the \"Whirlpool\" than anywhere else. At\r\nthat point there was no division of the cataract, but at the \"Devil's\r\nHole\" there are indications of a lateral fall, probably similar to\r\nwhat is now called the American Fall. At the Whirlpool, the rocks are\r\nstill united beneath the water, shewing that they were once continuous\r\nabove its surface also.[89]--_Agassiz on Lake Superior_, p. 15.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 89: The data on which these and the previous remarks on\r\n     the geology of the Falls are founded, are derived from Professor\r\n     James Hall's investigations in the New York State Survey. A.\r\n\r\n6. _On the Existence of Manganese in Water._--At a meeting of the\r\nAmerican Academy, in January 1849, Dr Charles T. Jackson stated that\r\nhe had discovered the presence of manganese in the water of streams,\r\nlakes, &c., almost universally. He detected it in water from the\r\nmiddle of Lake Superior, in Cochituate water, and in water from\r\nvarious sources. It has usually been regarded as iron in previous\r\nanalyses. He considered the observation as having an important bearing\r\nin accounting for the deposits of bog manganese at the outlets of\r\nponds, lakes, and in bogs, as well as for the source of the oxide of\r\nmanganese in the blood.--_Annual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 202.\r\n\r\n_On the Presence of Organic Matter in Water._--The following facts\r\nrelative to the presence of organic matter in water were presented to\r\nthe British Association, by Professor Forchhammer, as the result of\r\nextended observations on the water, near Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n_1st_, The quantity of organic matter in water is greatest in summer.\r\n_2d_, It disappears, for the most part, as soon as the water freezes.\r\n_3d_, Its quantity is diminished by rain. _4th_, Its quantity is\r\ndiminished if the water has to run a long way in open channels. The\r\nhypermanganate of potash or soda is recommended by the Professor as a\r\nmost excellent test for the presence of organic matter in water.\r\n\r\n7. _Arsenic in Chalybeate Springs._--Since the discovery of arsenic in\r\nthe deposits from certain chalybeate springs, it has been asked\r\nwhether the poisonous properties of this substance are not neutralized\r\nby the state in which it is found. M. Lassaigne has finished a series\r\nof experiments connected with this subject, for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the proportion of arsenic contained, in what state of\r\ncombination it exists, and the nature of the action which these\r\narseniferous deposits exert in the animal economy. The following are\r\nM. Lassaigne's conclusions:--1. In the natural deposits of the mineral\r\nwaters of Wattviller, arsenic exists to the amount of 2·8 per cent. 2.\r\nA portion of these deposits, representing 1·76 grains of arsenic acid,\r\nor 1·14 grains of arsenic, produced no effect upon the health of a\r\ndog. 3. This non-action shews that the poisonous property of the\r\narsenic is destroyed by its combination with the peroxide of iron, and\r\nthus confirms what has been before asserted, that peroxide of iron, by\r\ncombining with arsenious and arsenic acid, destroys their poisonous\r\nproperties, and consequently becomes an antidote for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n8. _The Coal Formation of America._--The coal regions of America are,\r\nfrom the explorations which have thus far been made, supposed to be\r\ndivided into three principal masses; the great central tract,\r\nextending from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to the west of Pennsylvania, and\r\nbeing apparently continued to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; the\r\nsecond tract strikes north-westward from Kentucky, crosses the Ohio,\r\nand stretches through Illinois to the Mississippi River; a third\r\nregion, smaller than the others, lies between the three great\r\nlakes--Erie, Huron, and Michigan. Competent geologists affirm that,\r\nfrom a comparison of the coal strata of contiguous basins, these are\r\nno more than detached parts of a once continuous deposit.\r\n\r\nThe extent of this enormous coal field is, in length, from north-east\r\nto south-west, more than 720 miles, and its greatest breadth about 180\r\nmiles; its area, upon a moderate calculation, amounts to 63,000 square\r\nmiles! In addition to these, there are several detached tracts of\r\nanthracite in Eastern Pennsylvania, which form some of the most\r\nremarkable coal tracts in the world. They occupy an area of about 200\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nThe strata which constitute this vast deposit comprehend nearly all\r\nthe known varieties of coal, from the dryest and most compact\r\nanthracite to the most fusible and combustible common coal. One of the\r\nmost remarkable features of these coal-seams is their prodigious bulk.\r\nThe great bed of Pittsburgh, extending nearly the entire length of the\r\nMonongahela River, has been traced through a great elliptic area, of\r\nnearly 225 miles in its longest diameter, and of the maximum breadth\r\nof about 100 miles, the superficial extent being 14,000 square miles,\r\nthe thickness of the bed diminishing gradually from 12 or 14 feet to 2\r\nfeet. In 1847 the anthracite coal regions of Pennsylvania furnished\r\n3,000,000 tons, and 11,439 vessels cleared from Philadelphia in that\r\nyear, loaded with the article. The produce in 1848 and the present\r\nyear, is of course larger.\r\n\r\nThe bituminous coal area of the United States is 133,132 square miles,\r\nor one 17th part of the whole. The bituminous coal area of British\r\nAmerica is 18,000 square miles, or one 45th part; Great Britain, 8139\r\nsquare miles; Spain, 3408 square miles, or one 52d part; France, 1719\r\nsquare miles, or one 118th part; and Belgium, 518 square miles, or one\r\n122d part. The area of the Pennsylvania anthracite coal formations is\r\nput down at 437 square miles; and that of Great Britain and Ireland\r\nanthracite and culm, at 3720 square miles. The anthracite coal of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, however, is not nearly so valuable an\r\narticle of fuel as the anthracite coal of Pennsylvania, nor does a\r\ngiven area yield so much as the latter.--_New York Express._ _American\r\nAnnual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 271.\r\n\r\n9. _River Terraces of the Connecticut Valley._--At the meeting of the\r\nAmerican Association in August, President Hitchcock of Amherst\r\nCollege, read a paper \"On the River Terraces of the Connecticut\r\nValley, and on the Erosions of the Earth's Surface.\" He stated that\r\nhis paper must be considered as containing a few facts and suggestions\r\nand not a finished theory. He has examined the valley from its mouth\r\nto Turner's Falls, and carefully measured the heights of the terraces.\r\n\"As you approach the river you find plains of sand, gravel, or loam,\r\nterminated by a slope sometimes as steep as 35°, and a second plain,\r\nthen another slope and another plain, and so on, sometimes to a great\r\nnumber. I find that these terraces occur in successive basins, formed\r\nby the approaches of the mountains upon the banks at intervals.\r\nSometimes the basin will be 15 or 20 miles in width, but usually much\r\nnarrower; and it is upon the margins of these basins that the terraces\r\nare formed. I have rarely found terraces more than 200 feet above the\r\nriver, which would be in Massachusetts, about 300 feet above the\r\nocean, and at Hanover, N.H., about 560 feet. Nowhere do they exist\r\nalong any river, unless that river has basins. As to the materials of\r\nwhich they are formed they appear exceedingly artificial. The outer or\r\nhighest terrace is generally composed of coarser materials than the\r\ninner ones. They are all composed of materials which are worn from the\r\nrocks, but the outer terrace oftener is full of pebbles, some of them\r\nas large as 12 inches, while the materials of the inner seem reduced\r\nto an impalpable powder, like the soil of a meadow which is overflowed\r\nduring high water. Whence did these materials originate? The materials\r\nwere first worn from solid rocks, and afterwards brought into these\r\nvalleys. The outer terrace appears to have been often in part the\r\nresult of the drift agency. Afterwards, the river agency sorted the\r\nmaterials, and gave them a level surface, the successive basins having\r\nat that time barriers. The inner terrace appears to have been, at\r\nleast in its upper part, the result of deposition from the river\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"I will now mention a few facts which I have observed. The terraces do\r\nnot generally agree in height upon the opposite sides of the valley.\r\nThe higher ones oftener agree, perhaps, than the lower ones. If\r\nformed, as I suppose, from the rivers, we should expect this. The\r\nterraces slope downwards in the direction of the stream. The same\r\nterrace which, near South Hadley, is 190 feet above the river, slopes\r\nuntil, at East Hartford, it is only 40 feet above the river, thus\r\nsloping 150 feet more than the slope of the river itself, in a\r\ndistance of 40 or 50 miles. This shows that they could not have been\r\nformed by the sea or by a lake, for they would then have been\r\nhorizontal. The greatest number of terraces observed is eight or nine.\r\nGenerally there are but two or three.\" President Hitchcock then gives\r\nhis view of the precise mode in which these terraces were formed,\r\nillustrating them by references to other parts of our country, and\r\nconcludes by a notice of the erosions of the earth's surface.--_Annual\r\nof Scientific Discovery_, 1850, p. 229.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\n10. _Fossil Crinoids of the United States._--At the meeting of the\r\nAmerican Association, 1849, a paper on the fossil crinoids of\r\nTennessee, by Professor Troost, was read by Professor Agassiz.[90] The\r\nspecies embraced are not less than eighty-eight in number, of which\r\nonly half a dozen have been described. It is the opinion of Professor\r\nHall that all the silurian formations of New York, previous to the\r\nbeginning of the geological survey, did not afford more than four or\r\nfive. Now, about sixty species have been ascertained. Professor Hall\r\nmentioned the fact, that all the crinoids of the lower silurian rocks,\r\nwith the exception of one species, have five pelvic plates, and we\r\nnever find one with three, or any other number of these plates, before\r\nwe reach the highest deposits. In Tennessee, the crinoids are so\r\nabundant, that Professor Troost states that he had been able to\r\ncollect some 300 or 400 good specimens of seven or eight different\r\nspecies in a single morning. In relation to the abundance of these\r\nfossils in the United States, Professor Agassiz remarked, that it is\r\nnot, perhaps, sufficiently appreciated of what importance, and of what\r\nimmense value the study of these fossil crinoids may be for the\r\nprogress of palæontology. American students should be proud of these\r\nmaterials, by which they will be able to throw so much light upon\r\nthese almost extinct families by their personal investigations, which\r\nwill not only render them independent of the palæontologist from\r\nabroad for information with regard to the succession of types, and the\r\nfull illustration of these structures, but really afford correct\r\nstandards for comparison. It is the more desirable that all these\r\nfossils should be made known, as the family of crinoids is so reduced\r\nin our days that we can form no idea of the living animals of that\r\ngroup, of their diversity of form, modification of character, and\r\npeculiarity of position, from the living type only. He doubted whether\r\nthe number of crinoid heads of all species found in Europe, now\r\nexisting in the Museums of Europe, is one-third the number of those\r\nwhich have been found by a single gentleman in Tennessee in one\r\nmorning. Now, with such materials, consider what precise and what\r\nminute investigations could be made. And if these facts could be once\r\nfully ascertained and well illustrated, there is no doubt that the\r\nseries of crinoids, and their succession in former ages, will be\r\nestablished from American standards, and will no longer rest upon the\r\nEuropean evidence, which has often been derived from the examination\r\nof small fragments of those ancient fossils, found in unconnected\r\nbasins for the most part, so that their geological succession could be\r\nascertained only with great doubt and difficulty. In conclusion,\r\nProfessor Agassiz would venture to say, that geologists who have had\r\nany opportunity to compare the position of the ancient rocks on this\r\ncontinent of North America with the corresponding deposits of Europe,\r\nwould agree with him in saying that the geology proper, the\r\nstratography of North America, will afford the same precise and well\r\nauthenticated standards for the appreciation of the order of\r\nsuccession of rocks, as fossils will for the order of succession of\r\nliving beings.--_American Annual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 282.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 90: These fossiliferous remains were discovered in the\r\n     carbonaceous and silurian strata of the State, and shew a\r\n     wonderful development of that form of animal on the shores during\r\n     the palæozoic period. Thirty-one genera, sixteen of which are\r\n     considered by Professor Troost as new, are enumerated.\r\n\r\n11. _Discovery of Coral Animals on the Coast of\r\nMassachusetts._--Professor Agassiz, while on an expedition in one of\r\nthe vessels of the coast survey during the past summer, obtained by\r\nmeans of a dredge, from a depth of seventy-two feet, in the Vineyard\r\nSound off Gay Head, several specimens of a coral with its animals. By\r\ngreat care and attention they were preserved alive in glass jars for\r\nmore than six weeks, and afforded an excellent opportunity for an\r\nexamination and observation of their structure and habits. These\r\ncorals belong to the genus _Astrangia_, and have been named by\r\nProfessor Agassiz, in honour of Professor Dana, geologist of the\r\nexploring expedition, Astrangia Dana.\r\n\r\nThis species presents two varieties. Some are of a pink or rose\r\ncolour, others are white. The general form of the animal is a cylinder\r\n(as of all Polypi) resting on its base, and expanded on the upper\r\nmargin; thus expanded it is about two lines in diameter. The number of\r\ntentacles is definite, but it is not always the same absolute number.\r\nIt never exceeds twenty-four; in earlier periods of life there are\r\nonly twelve, and there is even an epoch when there are only six.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, a matter of surprise that the coral animal should have\r\nbeen found in this latitude. They teem in the warm latitudes; but\r\nthere are very few species in the more temperate regions, and but for\r\nthe opportunity afforded by the coast survey, the existence of these\r\nanimals could not have been suspected on these shores. For many years,\r\nhowever, dead fragments had been found along the shores; but whether\r\nthey lived there naturally or not had not been ascertained.--_American\r\nAnnual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 311.\r\n\r\n12. _On the Circulation and Digestion of the Lower\r\nAnimals._--Professor Agassiz states, that the circulation of the\r\ninvertebrata cannot be compared to that of the vertebrata. Instead of\r\nthe three conditions of chyme, chyle, and blood, which the circulating\r\nfluid of the vertebrata undergoes, the blood of that class of the\r\ninvertebrata which he had particularly studied, the annelida or worms,\r\nis simple coloured chyle. The receptacles of chyle in different parts\r\nof the body are true lymphatic hearts, like those found in the\r\nvertebrata; this kind of circulation is found in the articulata and\r\nmollusks, with few exceptions, and in some of the echinoderms. In the\r\nmedusæ and polyps, instead of chyle, chyme mixed with water is\r\ncirculated; this circulation is found in some mollusks and intestinal\r\nworms. Professor Agassiz thinks, that the embryological development of\r\nthe higher animals shews a similar succession in the circulating\r\nfunction. As regards the connection between respiration and\r\ncirculation in vertebrata, the gills are found between branches of the\r\nblood system; in invertebrata, the chyliferous system is acted on by\r\nthe respiration. The gills of fishes, therefore, cannot be compared to\r\nthe gills of crustacea, articulata, and mollusks. In fact, no gills\r\nare connected with the chymiferous circulation. Animals having this\r\ncirculation, have no true respiration. They have only tubes to\r\ndistribute freshly aërated water to different parts of the\r\nbody.--_Proc. Bost. Nat. Hist. Soc._\r\n\r\n13. _Distribution of the Testaceous Mollusca of Jamaica._--The great\r\nnumber of species is remarkable. A few miles of coast, without the aid\r\nof storms, and without dredging, yielded 450 species. In the small bay\r\nof Port Royal, 350 marine species were found. A pint of sand, taken\r\nfrom a surface three yards long, contained 110 species. Probably there\r\nare 350 or 400 specimens of land shells, and two or three times as\r\nmany of marine species. Extensive districts occur, however, which are\r\nnearly destitute of land or marine shells. They are accumulated in\r\nfavourable stations.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the extent of the distribution of the marine and of\r\nthe terrestrial species is remarkable. A majority of the marine\r\nspecies are known to occur in the other islands; probably not more\r\nthan 10 or 15 per cent. of them will be found to be peculiar to\r\nJamaica. But of the land shells, 95 per cent. are peculiar to the\r\nisland. The limited distribution of the terrestrial species is\r\nremarkable. A few are generally distributed, but a large number are\r\nlimited to districts of a few miles in diameter; and several, although\r\noccurring abundantly, could be found only within the space of a few\r\nrods. Only seventeen fresh-water species were found. Favourable\r\nstations for fresh-water species are rare.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the number of individuals of mollusca in Jamaica, as\r\ncompared with more northern latitudes, the rule so obvious in the\r\nclass of fishes is not applicable to the same extent. Of fishes, the\r\nspecies are much more numerous, but individuals much less so. Of the\r\nmollusca, the total number of individuals is about the same as in this\r\nlatitude, and the number of species represented by a profusion of\r\nindividuals is about the same. But the number of species not occurring\r\nabundantly is much greater, so that the average of individuals to all\r\nthe species is less than in this latitude. From a comparison of the\r\nlaws of distribution of the marine and terrestrial species in the\r\nAntilles, it follows that the number of the latter must exceed that of\r\nthe former. With the insular distribution of the terrestrial species\r\nmay be associated the fact, that the coral reefs are all fringing, for\r\nboth facts are connected with the geological fact, that these islands\r\nare in a process of elevation.--Professor ADAMS before the American\r\nAssociation.--_American Annual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 334.\r\n\r\n14. _Metamorphoses of the Lepidoptera._--Professor Agassiz said that\r\nhe had, during the past season, been studying the metamorphoses of the\r\nLepidoptera, and, to his great surprise, he had found that one stage\r\nin the transformation of these insects has been overlooked by\r\nnaturalists. We knew the Lepidoptera in three conditions,--that of the\r\nworm, furnished with jaws and jointed, the chrysalis, and the perfect\r\ninsect with four wings. The change not before described, which he had\r\nnoticed, is somewhat concealed under the skin of the caterpillar. The\r\nanimal at a certain period swells at the thoracic region, and becomes\r\nextremely sensitive to the touch in this part, the skin being, in\r\nfact, in a state of inflammation. On cutting open the skin at this\r\nplace, Professor Agassiz found beneath it a four-winged insect, before\r\nit had passed into the chrysalis state. The wings were long enough to\r\nextend half the length of the perfect insect. The posterior pair he\r\nfound to be membraneous bags, somewhat flattened, like the respiratory\r\nvesicles of marine worms, with distinct ribs, which are blood-vessels.\r\nThe anterior pair are also bags, with their upper half stiff and\r\ninflexible, like the elytra of coleoptera. The legs are tubular, but\r\nnot joined, as in the perfect insect. The jaws are changed into two\r\nlong tubes, which are bent backwards, as are also the antennæ. In the\r\nchrysalis, the wings are flattened and soldered together, as are the\r\nlegs and sucking-tubes, which are bent backwards. The order of\r\ndevelopment of the different parts and the coleopterous condition at\r\nan incomplete stage, show that naturalists have been in error in\r\nplacing chewing insects, as the coleoptera, above the sucking insects.\r\nThe order should be reversed. Professor Agassiz said that he had\r\nconfirmed his observations in many specimens, by examining them just\r\nat the moment when the skin begins to split on the back.--_American\r\nAnnual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 327.\r\n\r\n15. _On the Zoological Character of Young Mammalia._--At the meeting\r\nof the American Association for the Promotion of Science, Professor\r\nAgassiz remarked, that zoologists have, in their investigations,\r\nconstantly neglected one side of their subject, which, when properly\r\nconsidered, will throw a great amount of new light on their\r\ninvestigations. Studying animals, in general, it has been the habit to\r\ninvestigate them in their full grown condition, and scarcely ever to\r\nlook back for their characters in earlier periods of life. We scarcely\r\never find, in a book of natural history, a hint as to the difference\r\nwhich exists in the young and old. Perhaps in birds, the colour of the\r\nyoung may be noticed; and it is generally known, that the young\r\nresemble the female more than the male; but as to precise\r\ninvestigation of the subject, we are deficient. But if the early\r\nstages of life have been neglected, there is one period in the history\r\nof animals which has been thoroughly investigated, for the last\r\ntwenty-five years,--embryology. The changes which take place within\r\nthe egg itself, and which give rise to the new individual, have been\r\nthoroughly examined; but, after the formation of the new being, the\r\nchanges in its form which it passes through, up to its full grown\r\ncondition, have been neglected. It had been his object to investigate\r\nthis subject, because he had been struck with the deficiency there is\r\non this point in our works; and in making this investigation, he had\r\nfound that the young animals, in almost all classes, differ widely\r\nfrom what they are in their full-grown condition. For instance, a\r\nyoung bat, a young bird, or a young snake, at a certain period of\r\ntheir growth within the egg, resemble each other so much, that he\r\nwould defy the most able zoologist of our day to distinguish between a\r\nrobin and a bat, or between a robin and a snake. There is something of\r\nhigh significance in this fact. There is something common to all\r\nthese. There is a thought behind these material phenomena, which shews\r\nthat they are all combined under one rule, and that they only come\r\nunder different laws of development, to assume, finally, different\r\nshapes, according to the object for which they were introduced.\r\n\r\nThere is a period of life, in which, whatever may be the final form of\r\ntheir organs of locomotion, whatever may be the final difference\r\nbetween the anterior and posterior extremities, vertebrated animals\r\nhave uniform legs, in the shape of little paddles or fins. This is the\r\ncase with lizards as well as birds. A robin's wing and a robin's leg,\r\nwhich are so different from a bat's wing and a bat's leg, do not\r\nessentially differ when young from the leg and arm of a bat. Wherever\r\nwe observe combined fingers preserving this condition, we have a\r\ndecided indication that such animals rank lower in the group to which\r\nthey belong. This is all-important, as we are enabled at once to group\r\nanimals which are otherwise allied, in a natural series, as soon as we\r\nknow whether they have combined or divided fingers. And the degree of\r\ndivision to which the legs rise in their development is a safe guide\r\nin our classification. Look, for instance, at the legs of dogs and\r\ncats, in which the fingers are completely separated, and so elongated,\r\nthat the animals walk naturally upon tip-toe, and compare them with\r\nothers, bears, for instance, which walk upon the whole sole of the\r\nfoot; and, again, with those of seals or bats, which remain united,\r\nand constitute either fins or a wing.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons sufficient to convince us that the order of\r\narrangement which he had assigned them, according the development of\r\nthe fingers, is justified by the state of development of the other\r\norgans of the mammalia, and especially of their higher organs and\r\nintellectual faculties and instincts. And I will also add, says\r\nProfessor Agassiz, that mankind are not excluded from this connection,\r\nbut, in common with other vertebrata, we are all at one stage of\r\nexistence provided with paddles or fins, which are afterwards\r\ndeveloped into legs and arms.--_American Annual of Scientific\r\nDiscovery_, p. 324.\r\n\r\n16. _The Manatus or Sea Cow, the Embryonic Type of the\r\nPachydermata?_--Professor Agassiz thinks that the Manati have been\r\nimproperly considered cetaceans: they differ from them in the form of\r\nthe skull, which is elongated, and in the position of the nostrils,\r\nwhich are in front. On the other hand, the skull resembles that of the\r\nelephant in front (particularly when seen from above), in some of the\r\ndetails of the facial bones, which are not like those of the cetacea,\r\nin the palatine bones, the arrangement of the teeth, and in the curve\r\nof the lower jaw. Professor Agassiz, believed this to be the true\r\nembryonic type of the Pachydermata.--_American Annual of Scientific\r\nDiscovery_, p. 313.\r\n\r\n17. _Fossil Elephant and Mastodon from Africa._--M. Gervais\r\ncommunicated to the French Academy, on March 12th, that he had just\r\nreceived from Algiers, a drawing of the molar tooth of a fossil\r\nelephant, whose genus is very easily recognised, and which indicates a\r\nspecies more resembling those found in a fossil state in Europe, than\r\nthe present African elephant. This tooth was found at Cherchell, in\r\nthe province of Oran. Sicily has hitherto been the southernmost point\r\non the Mediterranean where the fossil elephant has been found.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he also mentioned the discovery, near Constantine,\r\nof some fossil remains of mastodons. Though fossil remains of this\r\nanimal have been previously found in all the other portions of the\r\nworld, these are the first discovered in Africa. The remains found are\r\na tooth and a rib, and, as far as can be judged from a drawing, they\r\nbelonged to an animal more resembling the mastodon brevirostris, or\r\nthe arvernensis, than the mastodon angustodens.--_American Journal of\r\nScientific Discovery_, p. 287.\r\n\r\n18. _Cauterization in the case of Poisonous Bites._--In the _Comptes\r\nRendus_ for January 8th, we find an article by M. Parchappe,\r\ncontaining the result of his observations on the question, whether the\r\nspread of poison produced by a bite can be prevented by cauterizing.\r\nHe was induced to examine into this subject, because M. Renard had\r\nstated that cauterization was found to have no effect when applied\r\neven within five minutes after the bite in the cure of one sort of\r\nvirus, and within one hour in that of another. These results, he was\r\naware, though derived from experiments upon animals, would weaken the\r\nconfidence of physicians and patients in the only mode that medicine\r\npossesses of preventing the bad effect of a bite from any poisonous\r\nanimal, where, as is generally the case, some considerable time must\r\nelapse before the remedy can be applied. M. Parchappe, accordingly,\r\nmade several experiments upon dogs, with an extract of nux vomica, all\r\nof which go to confirm him in ascribing to cauterization, a power even\r\ngreater than that commonly allowed it.--\"From these experiments it\r\nresults, that the immediate amputation or destruction in the living\r\nportion with which the extract of nux vomica has come in contact, has\r\nthe power of preventing the bad effects of the poison, even when it\r\nhas been in contact for some time.\" The author is aware, that there is\r\nconsiderable difference between the virus of animals, and the\r\nsubstance used by him, with reference to their direct and remote\r\neffects, but thinks that every one must admit that there is a great\r\n_analogy_ between them, is of the opinion, that in both cases the\r\npoison remains in the bitten part for a considerable time before it is\r\ntransmitted to the rest of the body, and that cauterizing should be\r\nadopted in all cases where a poisonous bite is even suspected.\r\n\r\n19. _Dental Parasites._--At a meeting of the American Academy,\r\nDecember 1849, a paper was read by Dr H. J. Bowditch, on the animal\r\nand vegetable parasites infesting the teeth, with the effects of\r\ndifferent agents in causing their removal and destruction.\r\nMicroscopical examinations had been made of the matter deposited on\r\nthe teeth and gums of more than forty individuals, selected from all\r\nclasses of society, in every variety of bodily condition, and in\r\nnearly every case animal and vegetable parasites in great numbers had\r\nbeen discovered. Of the animal parasites there were three or four\r\nspecies, and of the vegetable one or two. In fact, the only persons\r\nwhose mouths were found to be completely free from them cleansed their\r\nteeth four times daily, using soap once. One or two of these\r\nindividuals also passed a thread between the teeth to cleanse them\r\nmore effectually. In all cases the number of the parasites were\r\ngreater in proportion to the neglect of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the application of various agents was also noticed.\r\nTobacco juice and smoke did not impair their vitality in the least.\r\nThe same was also true of the chlorine tooth-wash, of pulverized bark,\r\nof soda, ammonia, and various other popular detergents. The\r\napplication of soap, however, appeared to destroy them instantly. We\r\nmay hence infer that this is the best and most proper specific for\r\ncleansing the teeth. In all cases where it has been tried, it receives\r\nunqualified commendation. It may also be proper to add, that none but\r\nthe purest white soap, free from all discolorations, should be\r\nused.--_American Annual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 320.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ARTS.\r\n\r\n20. _The Steamboat New World._--Every year sees some new steamboat\r\nconstructed, which surpasses in size, magnificence, or speed those\r\npreviously made. There is no doubt that the mechanics of this country\r\nexcel those of any other in their inland steamboats, and it is also\r\nprobable that in a few years the same can be said of our sea-going\r\nsteamships, though it must be allowed that those hitherto produced\r\nare, with few exceptions, decided failures. During the present year,\r\nthe new steamboat \"New World\" has commenced running. She is said to be\r\nthe longest boat ever put on the stocks in this country, and the\r\nlongest afloat in the world. Her length is 337 feet; extreme width, 69\r\nfeet; the engine is 76 feet in cylinder, 15 feet in stroke, and the\r\nwheels of iron, 46 feet in diameter. She draws 4½ feet of water. The\r\nengine is a low pressure one, and though the boat is so very long she\r\nobeys the helm with great readiness. Her decorations are all of the\r\nmost superb and costly character.\r\n\r\nIf we even attain any greater speed either in our inland or sea-going\r\nsteam-vessels, it will be principally by enlarging their size. Though\r\nsome improvements will doubtless be made in the engines and in the\r\nmodels of the vessels, yet the great gain will be by increasing the\r\ntonnage, for the reason that the size, and consequent room for engines\r\nand coal, increases much faster than does the opposition caused by the\r\nwater and the air.--_American Annual of Scientific Discovery_, p. 30.\r\n\r\n21. _Use of Parachutes in Mines._--It is well known that vertical\r\nladders for descending into deep mines are very fatiguing, so that the\r\nminers prefer to trust themselves to baskets suspended by ropes, and\r\nin many cases the baskets are the only means provided for descending\r\nand ascending. But accidents frequently occur from the breaking of the\r\nropes, in spite of all the precautions that can be taken to prevent\r\nit. The _Brussels Herald_ states that some experiments have lately\r\nbeen made on a large scale in Belgium with a contrivance intended to\r\nremedy this evil. The basket or cuffert is so made, that, in case the\r\nrope breaks, it immediately springs open, forming a sort of parachute,\r\nwhich is held suspended in the air by means of the strong current\r\nwhich, it is well known, is always rushing up from mines, owing to the\r\ntemperature below being higher than that above. The effect of this\r\napparatus was shown before a numerous company, several miners\r\nentrusting themselves to the basket, which was so arranged that at a\r\ncertain point the rope broke; they were sustained in the air by the\r\nopen basket, so that the experiments were entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\n22. _Adulteration of Drugs._--At a meeting of the New York Academy of\r\nMedicine, June 1849, an elaborate report was presented by Dr M. J.\r\nBailey, on the practical operation of the law prohibiting the\r\nimportation of adulterated and spurious drugs, medicines, &c.\r\n\r\nThe report states, that since the law took effect, July 1848, over\r\n90,000 lbs. of drugs of various kinds have been rejected and condemned\r\nin the ports of the United States. Of these, 34,000 lbs. was included\r\nunder the comprehensive title of Peruvian bark, 16,343 lbs. rhubarb\r\nroot, 11,707 lbs. jalap root, about 2000 lbs. senna, and about 15,000\r\nlbs. of other drugs. The agitation of the bill which preceded the\r\npassage of the law had its effect abroad, and the supply of\r\nadulterated drugs from foreign markets has greatly decreased. The\r\ndomestic supply, has on the contrary increased. Within a recent\r\nperiod, quinine in considerable quantities has been found in the\r\nmarket, adulterated to the extent of some twenty or twenty-five per\r\ncent. These frauds were undoubtedly perpetrated by or among our own\r\npeople. The material used for the adulteration of the quinine was\r\nfound, on analysis, to be _mannite and sulphate of barites_, in nearly\r\nequal weights. The latter article has long been used for this purpose,\r\nbut not until lately has _mannite_ been detected in the sulphate of\r\nquinine. It seems to have been ingeniously substituted for salicine,\r\nand a somewhat similar substance prepared from the poplar bark; which\r\narticles have heretofore been extensively used for like purposes. The\r\ningenuity consists in the fact, that it is much more difficult to\r\ndetect the adulterations when effected by the admixture of _mannite_,\r\nthan when by the admixture of salicine, &c., while the former can be\r\nfurnished for less than one-fourth of the expense of the latter.\r\n\r\nFor some years past an extensive chemical establishment has been in\r\noperation at Brussels, in Belgium, built up at great expense and care,\r\nand expressly designed for the manufacture, on a large scale, of\r\nimitations of all the most important foreign chemical preparations\r\nused in medicine; while, at the same time, an agent was travelling in\r\nthis country making sales, and soliciting orders in all the principal\r\ntowns on our sea-board. The articles were prepared and put up with\r\nconsummate skill and neatness; and the imitation was so perfect that\r\nit was impossible for the unsuspecting purchaser to distinguish them\r\nfrom the genuine, notwithstanding that, in some instances, they did\r\nnot contain over five per cent. of the substances represented by the\r\nlabel. Since the law went into effect at the port of New York, not a\r\nsingle package has been presented for entry. Dr Bailey states,\r\nhowever, that he has been informed that the persons formerly connected\r\nwith the Brussels firm, are now in this country engaged in the same\r\niniquitous business; hence the adulterations spoken of.--_Annual of\r\nScientific Discovery_, p. 188.\r\n\r\n23. _To restore Decayed Ivory._--Mr Layard, in his explorations among\r\nthe ruins of Nineveh, discovered some splendid works of art carved in\r\nivory, which he forwarded to England. When they arrived there, it was\r\ndiscovered that the ivory was crumbling to pieces very rapidly.\r\nProfessor Owen was consulted to know if there was any means of\r\npreventing the entire loss of these specimens of ancient art, and he\r\ncame to the conclusion that the decay was owing to the loss of the\r\nalbumen in the ivory, and therefore recommended that the articles be\r\nboiled in a solution of albumen. The experiment was tried, with\r\ncomplete success, and the ivory has been rendered as firm and solid as\r\nwhen it was first entombed.\r\n\r\n24. _Ivory as an Article of Manufacture._--There are several sorts of\r\nivory, differing from each other in composition, durability, external\r\nappearance, and value. The principal sources from which ivory is\r\nderived are the western coast of Africa and Hindostan: Camaroo ivory\r\nis considered the best, on account of its colour and transparency. In\r\nsome of the best tusks the transparency can be discovered even on the\r\noutside. The manufacturers have a process by which they make poor\r\nivory transparent, but it lasts only for a short time. A third kind of\r\nivory, called the Egyptian, has lately been introduced, which is\r\nconsiderably lower in price than the Indian, but in working there is\r\nmuch waste. By an analysis, the African ivory shows a proportion of\r\nanimal to earthy matter of 101 to 100; the Indian, 76 to 100; and the\r\nEgyptians, 70 to 100. The value of ivory consumed in Sheffield, where\r\nit is much used in making handles for cutlery, is very great, and\r\nnearly 500 persons are employed in working it up. To make up the\r\nweight of 180 tons consumed in that place, there must be about 45,000\r\ntusks, whose average weight is nine pounds each, though some weigh\r\nfrom 60 to 100 pounds. According to this, the number of elephants\r\nkilled every year is 22,500; but allowing that some tusks are cast,\r\nand some animals die, it may be fairly estimated that 18,000 are\r\nkilled every year merely for their ivory, which is contrary to the\r\nusual belief that the ivory used comes from the tusks cast by living\r\nelephants. These estimates, it will be seen, are for Sheffield merely.\r\n\r\n25. _Flexible Ivory._--M. Charriere, a manufacturer of surgical\r\ninstruments in Paris, has for some time been in the habit of rendering\r\nflexible the ivory which he uses in making tubes, probes, and other\r\ninstruments. He avails himself of a fact which has long been known,\r\nthat when bones are subjected to the action of hydrochloric acid, the\r\nphosphate of lime, which forms one of their component parts, is\r\nextracted, and thus bones retain their original form and acquire great\r\nflexibility. M. Charriere, after giving to the pieces of ivory the\r\nrequired form and polish, steeps them in acid alone, or in acid\r\npartially diluted with water, and they thus become supple, flexible,\r\nelastic, and of a slightly yellowish colour. In the course of drying,\r\nthe ivory becomes hard and inflexible again, but its flexibility can\r\nbe at once restored by wetting it either by surrounding it with a\r\npiece of wet linen, or by placing sponge in the cavities of the\r\npieces. Some pieces of ivory have been kept in a flexible state in the\r\nacidulated water for a week, and they were neither changed, nor\r\ninjured, nor too much softened, nor had they acquired any taste or\r\ndisagreeable smell.\r\n\r\n26. _Air-Whistle._--Mr C. Daboll, of New London, Connecticut, has\r\ninvented a whistle that speaks with a most \"miraculous organ\" whenever\r\nits services are required for the purpose of alarm or warning. It is\r\ndesigned for the use of vessels at sea or on the coast, as on our\r\neastern shores, where dense fogs prevail, and vessels are liable to\r\ncome in collision before they are conscious of each other's approach.\r\nIts great advantage is its power of communicating sounds for a\r\ndistance of from 4 to 5 miles, far exceeding the largest bells. An\r\nexperimental one has been placed on Bartlett's Reef, and the pilot of\r\nthe \"Lawrence\" states that he has heard it when about 4 miles off from\r\nBartlett's Reef, _against the wind_, which was blowing quite fresh at\r\nthe time. This was on a clear day, and when the whistle was blown at\r\nhis request, and also by advice of the inventor, so that the distance\r\nmight be marked. It is probable that, under the same circumstances,\r\nthe tones of a bell could not have been heard more than from one half\r\nto three-fourths of a mile. The pilot of the steamer \"Knickerbocker\"\r\nreports, that he _made the whistle_ during a dense fog, thirteen\r\nminutes' running-time of the steamer, before coming up with the\r\nstation where it is located. He therefore must have been some four or\r\nfive miles distant from it when he heard it.\r\n\r\nThis whistle consists of an air chamber or condenser, of boiler iron\r\nsufficiently strong to resist almost any pressure, an air-pump, and a\r\nwhistle similar to the ordinary ones used on locomotives. By means of\r\nthe air-pump operating into this chamber, a pressure of air is\r\nobtained in it of any required amount,--say one, two, or three hundred\r\npounds to the square inch. When the air is so compressed, it is made\r\nto operate the whistle by simply opening a valve, and gives a distinct\r\nclear sound.\r\n\r\nA memorial has been presented to the Treasury Department, signed by\r\nmost of the commanders and pilots of the steamboats running through\r\nLong Island and Fisher's Island Sounds, setting forth the advantages\r\nto be derived to navigation from this whistle, and urging that it be\r\nintroduced into the light vessels, and at all stations where the\r\ngovernment intends to afford protection to navigation.--_Annual of\r\nScientific Discovery_, p. 70.\r\n\r\n27. _Curious Electrical Phenomenon._--We learn from a letter from a\r\ngentleman connected with the Bay State Mills, at Lawrence,\r\nMassachusetts, some facts with reference to a new and curious\r\napplication of electricity which has been introduced in those mills.\r\nThe electricity is generated by the motion of the machinery, and is\r\nemployed for lighting up the gas burners. It exists in large\r\nquantities in the card-rooms, where there are many belts running on\r\niron pulleys, and, in the cold dry atmosphere of winter, often\r\nproducing serious damage to the quality of the cording. The manner in\r\nwhich it was discovered that this electricity could be applied to\r\n\"lighting up,\" is somewhat curious. When the gas was first let into\r\nthe pipes in the mills, one of the overseers discovered fire setting\r\nout from one of the pipes near a belt, and on examination it was\r\nascertained that a small stream of gas was escaping. It was surmised\r\nthat it had been ignited by the electricity, and to prove it, an\r\nexperiment was tried. Near a large belt in the carding-room was a\r\ngas-burner, and on a bench between them there was placed a small\r\nquantity of wool, which is a non-conductor of electricity. If a person\r\nstood upon this wool, reaching one hand within two or three inches of\r\nthe belt, and touching the gas-burner with one finger of the other,\r\nthe escaping gas was at once ignited with an explosion like that of a\r\npercussion-cap,--the body of the operator thus being made the medium\r\nfor conducting the electricity.\r\n\r\nThe writer adds,--\"We shall be able to make a great saving of expense\r\nin the woollen manufacture, as soon as we can discover an effective\r\nmethod of conducting the electricity away from the cards, as we shall\r\nthen be able to dispense entirely with the use of oil on the wool, we\r\nshall save at least $30,000 per annum, when the mills are in full\r\noperation.\"--_American Annual of Scientific Discovery_ p. 117.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       _List of Patents granted for Scotland from 22d March to\r\n                          22d June 1850._\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
