Before 1870 it was inferior to the harbor at Havre, but now it\r\nfar surpasses the same. The river Scheldt, which is about 1,500 ft.\r\nwide, was badgered out up to the vertical walls of the basin, so that\r\nthe largest ships can land at the docks. The river was deepened by the\r\nuse of caissons, in the lower parts of which the workmen operated in\r\ncompressed air. The annexed cut shows that part of one of the caissons\r\nwhich projects above the surface of the water. The depth of the river at\r\nlow tide is about 26 ft., and at high tide about 39 ft. Some of the old\r\nsluices, channels, basins, etc., which were rendered useless by the\r\nimprovements made in the river Scheldt have been filled up, and\r\nthereby the city has been enriched by several handsome and elegant\r\nsquares.--_Illustrirte Zeitung_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF ANTWERP.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntwerp is now the chief port on the Continent. Since 1873 the progress\r\nhas continued, and made very rapid advances. In 1883 the tonnage of the\r\nport reached 3,734,428 registered tons. This marvelous development is\r\npartly due to the position of Antwerp as the embarking point from the\r\nContinent of Europe to America, and partly also to the recent additions\r\nand changes which have been carried out there, and which, now nearly\r\ncompleted, have made this cosmopolitan port one of the best organized in\r\nthe world. This is so well known that vessels bound for Switzerland with\r\na cargo of corn from Russia pass Marseilles and go two thousand miles\r\nout of their way for the purpose of unloading at Antwerp. No other port,\r\nin fact, offers the same facilities. There is not another place in the\r\nworld where fifty vessels of 3,000 tons can come alongside as easily as\r\nthe penny boats on the Thames run into the landing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAISSONS FOR DEEPENING THE RIVER AT ANTWERP.]\r\n\r\nSince the opening of the St. Gothard Tunnel nearly all the alimentary\r\nprovisions that Italy sends to the British Isles pass through Antwerp.\r\nIn 1882 82,000,000 eggs and 30,000 pounds of fruit were shipped there\r\nfor England. The greater part of these came from Italy. Antwerp has\r\nbecome also an important port for emigrants; 35,125 embarked in 1882,\r\nout of which number 3,055 were bound for New York. The city was always\r\ndestined, from its topographical position, to be at the head of a very\r\nconsiderable traffic; political reasons alone for many years prevented\r\nthis being the case. These have happily now disappeared, and, since\r\n1863, when the \"Scheldt was liberated,\" the progress of commerce has\r\nbeen more rapid than even the most ardent Antwerp patriot dared hope. At\r\nthat date the toll of 1s. 11d. on all vessels going up the river, and of\r\n7½d. on vessels going down, was abolished, and reforms were introduced\r\namong the taxes on the general navigation; the tax on tonnage in the\r\nport itself was abolished, and the pilot tax was lowered. The results of\r\nthese measures became immediately apparent. Traffic increased with\r\nsuch rapidity that in 1876 the crowding on the quays was such that the\r\nrelation of the tonnage to the length of the quay was about 270 tons per\r\nyard, which is four times as great as at Liverpool.\r\n\r\nA few words now, briefly, as to the nature of the important works[1]\r\ncompleted at Antwerp. They were commenced in 1877, and have opened for\r\nthe port an era of prosperity such as was never experienced even during\r\nthe sixteenth century, the zenith of her splendor. These works have\r\ncost £4,000,000, and have necessitated the employment of 12,000 tons\r\nof wrought iron, of 490,000 cubic yards of brickwork and concrete, of\r\n32,000 cubic yards of masonry, and of more than 3,300,000 cubic yards\r\nof earthwork in filling and dredging, etc. The quay walls run the whole\r\nlength of the town, a distance of rather more than two miles. It rests\r\non a foundation laid without timber footings, and giving a depth of\r\ntwenty-six feet at low water, sufficient drawing for the largest ships\r\nafloat. Beyond this wall are the real quays, which consists of first a\r\nline of rails reserved for hydraulic cranes serving to unload vessels\r\nand deposit their cargo railway trucks; secondly, a second line of rails\r\nparallel with the first, on which these trucks are stationed; thirdly,\r\nsheds extending toward the town for a width of one hundred and fifty\r\nfeet, and covered with galvanized iron sheetings. A third line of rails\r\nparallel with the two others runs from end to end of these sheds, and a\r\nnumber of lines placed transversely with this one connect it by means of\r\nspring bridges with, fourthly, four more lines also parallel with the\r\nquays, whence the goods start for the different stations, and thence to\r\ntheir destinations. The total width of these immense constructions is\r\nabout three hundred and twenty feet. Such is their magnitude that about\r\nsix hundred houses had to be pulled down to make place for them. A\r\nrailing running along their entire length cuts them off from the town.\r\n\r\n[Transcribers note 1: changed from 'words']\r\n\r\nDuring the course of last year 4,379 vessels entered the port of\r\nAntwerp, gauging a total of 3,734,428 tons, which places Antwerp, as I\r\nhave already stated, at the head of European ports. In 1882 the tonnage\r\nof Havre was only 2,200,000, that of Genoa 2,250,000, and of Bilboa\r\n315,000, owing to its iron ore exports. Among the English ports a few\r\nonly exceed Antwerp. London is still the first port in the world, with\r\na tonnage of 10,421,000 tons, and Liverpool the second, with 7,351,000\r\ntons; Newcastle follows with 6,000,000 tons, also in excess of Antwerp,\r\nbut both Hull and Glasgow are below, with respectively 1,875,000 and\r\n2,110,000 tons.--_Pall Mall Gazette_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBICYCLES AND TRICYCLES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A recent lecture before the Society of Arts, London.]\r\n\r\nBy C.V. BOYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this paper is one of such wide interest, and of such\r\ngreat importance, that it is quite unnecessary for me to make any\r\napology for bringing it to your notice. Exactly two months ago, I had\r\nthe honor of dealing with the same subject at the Royal Institution. On\r\nthat occasion I considered main principles only, and avoided anything in\r\nwhich none but riders were likely to take an interest, or which was in\r\nany way a matter of dispute. As it may be assumed that the audience here\r\nconsists largely of riders, and of those who are following those matters\r\nof detail, the elaboration, simplification, and perfection of which\r\nhave brought the art of constructing cycles to its present state of\r\nperfection, I purpose treating the subject from a totally different\r\npoint of view. I do not intend, in general, to describe anything,\r\nassuming that the audience is familiar with the construction of the\r\nleading types of machines, but rather to consider the pros and cons\r\nof the various methods by which manufacturers have striven to attain\r\nperfection. As a discussion on the subject of this paper will doubtless\r\nfollow--and I hope makers or riders of every class of machine will\r\nfreely express their opinion, for by so doing they will lend an interest\r\nwhich I alone could not hope to awaken--I shall not consider it\r\nnecessary to assume an absolutely neutral position, which might be\r\nexpected of me if there were no discussion, but shall explain my own\r\nviews without reserve.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of cycles may be grouped under the following heads:\r\n\r\n  1. The Bicycle unmodified.\r\n  2. The Safety bicycle, a modification of 1.\r\n  3. The Center-cycle.\r\n  4. The Tricycle, which includes five general types:\r\n  (a.) Rear steerer of any sort.\r\n  (b.) Coventry rotary.\r\n  (c.) Front steerer of any sort (except e).\r\n  (d.) Humber pattern.\r\n  (e.) The Oarsman.\r\n  5. Double machines: sociables and tandems.\r\n  6. The Otto.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly obvious that not one machine is superior to all others\r\nin every respect, for if that were the case, the rest would rapidly\r\nbecome extinct. Not one shows any signs of becoming extinct, and,\r\ntherefore, it may be assumed that each one possesses some points in\r\nwhich it is superior to others, the value of which is considered by\r\nits riders to far outweigh any points in which it may be inferior. The\r\nwidely varying conditions under which, and purposes for which, machines\r\nare used and the very different degrees of importance which differently\r\nconstituted minds attach to the peculiarities of various machines, will,\r\nprobably, prevent any from becoming extinct. Nevertheless, the very\r\ngreat advantages which some of these possess over others will, no doubt,\r\nin time become evident by the preponderance of the better class of\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nThe bicycle, which surpasses all other machines in simplicity,\r\nlightness, and speed, will probably, for these reasons, always remain a\r\nfavorite with a large class. The fact that it requires only one track\r\nplaces it at a great advantage with respect to other machines, for it is\r\ncommon for a road which is unpleasant from mud or stones to have a hard,\r\nsmooth edge, a kind of path, where the bicyclist can travel in peace,\r\nbut which is of little advantage to other machines. Again, the bicycle\r\ncan be wheeled through narrow gates or door ways, and so kept in places\r\nwhich are inaccessible to tricycles. One peculiarity of the bicycle,\r\nand to a certain extent of the center-cycle, is that the plane of the\r\nmachine always lies in the direction of the resultant force, that the\r\nmachine leans over to an amount depending on the velocity and the\r\nsharpness of the curve described. For this reason all lateral strain on\r\nthe parts is abolished, and if we except the slipping away of the wheel\r\nfrom under the rider, which can hardly occur on a country road, an upset\r\nfrom taking a curve too quickly is impossible. This leaning to either\r\nside by the machine and rider gives rise to that delightful gliding\r\nwhich none but the bicyclist or the skater can experience. In this\r\nrespect the bicycle has an enormous advantage over any machine, tricycle\r\nor Otto, which must at all times remain upright, and which must,\r\ntherefore, at a high speed, be taken round a curve with discretion.\r\n\r\nThe perfect and instantaneous steering of the bicycle, combined with\r\nits narrowness, counteract, to a great extent, the advantage which the\r\ntricyclist has of being able to stop so much more quickly, for\r\nthe bicyclist can \"dodge\" past a thing for which the rider of the\r\nthree-wheeler must pull up. In one other respect the bicyclist has an\r\nadvantage which, though of no real importance, has great weight with\r\nmany people. The bicycle well ridden presents a picture of such perfect\r\nelegance that no one on anything else need expect to appear to advantage\r\nin comparison.\r\n\r\nThe chief disadvantage of the bicycle is the fact that a rider cannot\r\nstop for any purpose, or go back a little, without dismounting. For town\r\nriding, where a stoppage is frequently necessitated by the traffic, this\r\nperpetual mounting and dismounting is not only tiresome, but wearying,\r\nso much so that few bicyclists care to ride daily in town.\r\n\r\nThe position of the rider on a bicycle, with respect to the treadles,\r\nis by no means good, for if he is placed sufficiently far forward to be\r\nable to employ his weight to advantage without bending himself double,\r\nhe will be in so critical a position that a mere touch will send him\r\nover the handles. He has, therefore, to balance stability and safety\r\nagainst comfort and power; the more forward he is, the more furiously he\r\ncan drive his machine, and the less does he suffer from friction and the\r\nshaking of the little wheel; the more backward he is, the less is he\r\nlikely to come to grief riding down hill, or over unseen stones. The\r\nbicyclist is no better off than the rider of any other machine with a\r\nlittle wheel, the vibration from which may weary him nearly as much as\r\nthe work he does. The little wheel as a mud-throwing machine engine is\r\nstill more effective on the bicycle than it is on any tricycle, for in\r\ngeneral it is run at a higher speed.\r\n\r\nI now come to the usual complaint about the bicycle. There is a fashion\r\njust now to call it dangerous and the tricycle safe. But the difference\r\nin safety has been much exaggerated. The bicyclist is more likely to\r\nsuffer from striking a stone than his friend on three wheels, but then\r\nhe should not strike one where the tricyclist would strike a dozen.\r\nProperly ridden, neither class of machine can be considered dangerous;\r\nan accident should never happen except it be due to the action of\r\nothers. People, carts, cattle, and dogs on the road are liable to such\r\nunexpected movements, that the real danger of the cyclist comes from the\r\noutside; to danger from absolute collapse, due to a hidden flaw in\r\nthe materials employed, every one is liable, but, the bicyclist more\r\nremotely than the tricyclist, owing to the greater simplicity of his\r\nmachine. The bicyclist, though he has further to fall in case of an\r\naccident from any of these causes, is in a better position than the\r\ntricyclist, for he is outside instead of inside his machine; he can in\r\nan instant get clear.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that many tricyclists consider accidents of the kind\r\nnext to impossible, for in several machines the rider is so involved\r\nthat an instantaneous dismount without a moment's notice, at any speed,\r\nis absolutely impossible. There remains one objection, which, however,\r\nshould be of next to no importance--the difficulty of learning the\r\nbicycle prevents many from taking to the light and fast machine, because\r\nthey are afraid of a little preliminary trouble.\r\n\r\nThe chief objections to the bicycle, then, are the liability of the\r\nrider to go over the handles, the impossibility of stopping very\r\nquickly, and the inability to remain at rest or go backward, and the\r\ndifficulty of learning.\r\n\r\nThe first two of these are, to a large extent, overcome in the safety\r\nbicycles, but not without the introduction of what is in comparison a\r\ncertain degree of complication, or without the loss of the whole of the\r\ngrace or elegance of the bicycle. On almost all of these safety bicycles\r\nthe rider is better placed than on the unmodified bicycle, but though\r\nsafer, I do not think bicyclists find them complete in speed, though, no\r\ndoubt, they are superior in that respect to the tricycle. Though they do\r\nnot allow the rider to stop without dismounting, the fatigue resulting\r\nfrom this cause is less than it is with a bicycle, owing to the fact\r\nthat with the small machines the rider has so small a distance to climb.\r\nOf these machines, the Extraordinary leaves the rider high up in the air\r\non a full-sized wheel, but places him further back and more over the\r\npedals. The motion of these is peculiar, being not circular, but oval, a\r\nform which has certain advantages.\r\n\r\nIn the Sun and Planet and Kangaroo bicycles a small wheel is \"geared\r\nup,\" that is, is made to turn faster than the pedals, so as to avoid the\r\nvery rapid pedaling which is necessary to obtain an ordinary amount\r\nof speed out of a small wheel. In each of these the pedals move in a\r\ncircular path, and their appearance is in consequence less peculiar than\r\nthat of the Facile, which, in this respect, does not compare favorably\r\nwith any good machine. The pedal motion on the Facile is merely\r\nreciprocating. Riders of machines where circular motion is employed,\r\namong them myself, do not believe that this reciprocating motion can\r\nbe so good as circular, but I understand that this view is not held by\r\nthose who are used to it. Of course, the harmonic motion of the Facile\r\npedal is superior to the equable reciprocating motion employed in some\r\nmachines where speed is an object, especially with small wheels.\r\n\r\nIf I have overlooked anything typical in the modified bicycle class,\r\nI hope some one will afterward supply the omission, and point out any\r\npeculiarities or advantages.\r\n\r\nThat very peculiar machine, the center-cycle, seems to combine many of\r\nthe advantages of the bicycle and tricycle. On it the rider can remain\r\nat rest, or can move backward; he can travel at any speed round curves\r\nwithout an upset being possible; he can ride over brickbats, or\r\nobstructions, not only without being upset, but, if going slowly,\r\nwithout even touching them. As this machine is very little known, a few\r\nwords of explanation may be interesting.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the rider is placed over the main wheel, as in the\r\nbicycle, but much further forward. There are around him, on or near the\r\nground, four little wheels, two before and two behind, supported in a\r\nmanner the ingenuity of which calls for the utmost admiration. Turning\r\nthe steering handle not only causes the front and rear pairs to turn\r\nopposite ways, but owing to their swiveling about an inward pointing\r\naxis, the machine is compelled to lean over toward the inside of the\r\ncurve; not only is this the case, but each pair rises and falls with\r\nevery inequality of the road, if the rider chooses that they run on the\r\nground; but he can, if he pleases, arrange that in general they ride in\r\nthe air, any one touching at such times as are necessary to keep him on\r\nthe top of the one wheel, on which alone he is practically riding. He\r\ncan, if he likes, at any time lift the main wheel off the ground and run\r\nalong on the others only. The very few machines of the kind which I have\r\nseen have been provided with foot straps, to enable the rider to pull as\r\nwell as push, which is a great advantage when climbing a hill, but this\r\nis on every machine except the Otto, of which I shall speak later,\r\nconsidered a dangerous practice.\r\n\r\nSome of the objections to the bicycle to which I have referred were\r\nsufficient to prevent many, especially elderly men, from dreaming of\r\nbecoming cyclists. So long as the tricycle was a crude and clumsy\r\nmachine, there was no chance of cycling becoming a part, as it almost is\r\nand certainly soon will be, of our national life. The tricycle has been\r\nbrought to such a state of perfection that it is difficult to imagine\r\nwhere further progress can be made.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be well to mention what is necessary in order that a\r\nthree-wheeled machine may be made to roll freely in a straight line, and\r\nalso round curves. At all times each wheel must be able to travel in\r\nits own plane in spite of the united action of the other two. To run\r\nstraight, the axes of all the wheels must obviously be parallel. To run\r\nround a curve, the axis of each must, if continued, pass through the\r\ncenter of curvature of the curve. If two wheels have a common axis, the\r\nintersection of the two lines forming the axes can only meet in one\r\npoint. To steer such a combination, therefore, the plane of the third\r\nwheel only need be turned. If the axis of no two are common, then the\r\nplanes of two of the wheels must be turned in order that the three axes\r\nmay meet in a point.\r\n\r\nNot only does free rolling depend on the suitable direction of the\r\nplanes of the wheels, each wheel must be able to run at a speed\r\nproportional to its distance from the point of intersection of the three\r\naxes, i.e., from the ever-shifting center of curvature.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious way, then, of contriving a three wheeler is to drive\r\none wheel, steer with another, and leave the third, which must be\r\nopposite the driver, idle. The next in simplicity is to drive with one\r\nwheel, and steer with the other two, having one in front and the other\r\nbehind. So far then, the single driving rear-steerer and the Coventry\r\nrotary pattern are easily understood. The evils of single driving,\r\nminimized, it is true, to a large extent, in the Coventry rotary, have\r\nled to the contrivance of means by which a wheel on each side may be\r\ndriven without interfering with their differential motion in turning a\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nThree methods are commonly used, but as only two are employed on\r\ntricycles, I shall leave the third till I come to the special machine\r\nfor which it is necessary. The most easy to understand is the clutch,\r\na model of which I have on the table. If each main wheel is driven by\r\nmeans of one of these, though compelled to go forward by the crankshaft,\r\nit is yet free to go faster without restraint. By this means \"double\r\ndriving\" is effected in several forms of tricycle.\r\n\r\nDifferential gear, which is well understood, and of which there are\r\nseveral mechanically equivalent forms, divides the applied driving\r\npower, whether forward or backward, between the main wheels, equally if\r\nthe gear is perfect, unequally if imperfect. To understand the effect\r\nof the two systems of driving, and of single driving, let us place on\r\ngrooves a block which offers resistance to a moving force. If we wish\r\nto move it, and apply our force at the end of one side, it will tend to\r\nturn round as well as move forward, and much friction will be spent on\r\nthe guides by their keeping it straight.\r\n\r\nThis is the single driver. If, instead of applying force at one side, we\r\npush the block bodily forward by a beam moving parallel to itself, then\r\nso long as the guides are straight no strain will be put upon them,\r\neven though one side of the block is resisted more than the other; if,\r\nhowever, the guides compelled the block to travel round a curve, then\r\nthe power, instead of being divided between the two sides in such\r\nproportion as is necessary to relieve the guides of all strain, is\r\nsuddenly applied only to the inside, and the effect is that of a single\r\ndriver only. This is the clutch. Lastly, if the last-mentioned beam,\r\ninstead of being pushed along parallel to itself, were pivoted in the\r\nmiddle, and that pivot only pushed, the same power would be applied to\r\neach side of the block, and no strain would be thrown on the guides,\r\nwhether straight or curved, so long as the resistance opposed to the\r\nblock on the two sides were equal; if, however, one side met with more\r\nresistance than the other, then the guides would have to keep the block\r\nstraight. This is the differential gear.\r\n\r\nI have assumed that in the last case the force was applied to the middle\r\nof the beam; this corresponds to every evenly-balanced gear. In the gear\r\nemployed by Singer, which is not evenly balanced, but which derives its\r\ngood qualities from its simplicity, the same effect is produced as\r\nif the beam were pivoted on one side of the center instead of on the\r\ncenter. Thus, though both sides are driven, one is driven more than the\r\nother. On the whole, there is no doubt that the balanced gear gives a\r\nsuperior action to the clutch, for except when the two sides of the\r\nmachine meet with very different resistance, and then only when running\r\nstraight, the clutch will not compare with the other. The clutch also\r\ngives rise to what is considered by most riders a grave defect, the\r\ninability to back treadle, while the free pedal, which is an immediate\r\nconsequence, is considered by others a luxury.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this same free pedal can be obtained on\r\ndifferentially driven machines to which speed and power gear have been\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nOf the relative merits of different forms of differential gear there is\r\nlittle to be said. Perhaps it will not be thought I am unduly thrusting\r\nmyself forward, if I refer to a scheme of my own, in which no toothed\r\nwheels are employed, but in which two conical surfaces are driven by a\r\nseries of balls lying in the groove between them, and jambed against\r\nthem by a recessed ring.\r\n\r\nI have here a large wooden diagrammatic model, and a small working\r\nmodel in steel, which shows that the new principle employed is correct,\r\nnamely, that a ball while jambed is free to turn, or if turning is able\r\nto jamb. All Humbers, and most front steerers, employ differential\r\ngearing; in some front steerers the clutch of necessity is used.\r\n\r\nNeglecting for the present the different modes of transmitting power\r\nfrom the pedals to the main wheels, it is possible now to consider the\r\nfour typical builds of tricycle. The only advantage that a rider can\r\nfind in a rear-steerer is the open front, so that in case of accident\r\nhe can more easily clear himself of his machine; as I have already\r\nremarked, this power of instantly escaping seems to be considered by\r\nmany as of no importance.\r\n\r\nIn a rear-steerer which has not an open front, whether driven by a\r\nclutch or by differential gear, I fail to discover any good quality.\r\nThe steering of a rear-steerer is so very uncertain, that such machines\r\ncannot safely be driven at anything like a high speed, because any wheel\r\nmeeting with an obstruction will, by checking the machine, diminish the\r\nweight on the steering wheel just at the time when a greater weight than\r\nusual should be applied. It is for the corresponding reason that the\r\nsteering of a front-steerer is so excellent; the more the machine is\r\nchecked by obstruction, by back treading, or by the brake, the greater\r\nis the weight on the front wheel.\r\n\r\nFor shooting hills, or for pulling up suddenly, no machine of any kind\r\nwill compare with a good front-steerer. In all respects it is superior\r\nto the rear-steerer if we except the open front, but against this may\r\nbe set the fact that on many the rider can mount from behind, or can\r\ndismount in the same manner while the machine is in motion. Experience\r\nshows that the front-steerer is for general excellence, safety, easy\r\nmanagement, and light-running, the best all-round tricycle that is to be\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nThe Humber build, which departs less from the ordinary bicycle than any\r\nothar, is far superior to all others for speed; it is, however, somewhat\r\ndifficult to manage, for the steering is not only delicate, but\r\ncritical, requiring constant care lest a stone or other obstruction\r\nshould take the rider unawares, and steer the machine for him.\r\n\r\nThe control which a skillful rider of the Humber has over his machine is\r\nwonderful; the elegance of the machine among tricycles is unequaled.\r\nSo great a favorite is this form, especially among the better class of\r\nriders, that almost every firm have brought out their own Humber, each\r\nwith a distinguishing name.\r\n\r\nThe only improvement or change, whichever it may be, that has been made\r\nby others with which I am acquainted, is the triple steering, in which\r\nthe hind wheel moves the opposite way to the others. The corresponding\r\nchange in the bicycle was soon discarded; I do not know what advantage\r\ncan result from the increased delicacy of steering here. I should have\r\nthought it delicate enough already.\r\n\r\nOne noticeable change in the front-steering tricycle, which has been\r\nlargely made, lately, is the substitution of central for side gearing,\r\nin consequence of which bicycle cranks can be employed, instead of\r\nthe cranked axle, with its fixed throw. This gives an appearance of\r\nlightness which the older types of machine do not possess.\r\n\r\nI now come to that very difficult and all-important subject, the method\r\nof transmitting power from the body of the rider to the main axle. Next\r\nto the structural arrangement, this is most important in distinguishing\r\none type of machine from another.\r\n\r\nThe first to which I shall refer is the direct action employed on the\r\nNational and the Monarch tricycles. It is obvious that by having no\r\nseparate crank shaft, much greater simplicity and cheapness and less\r\nfriction are attained than can be possible when the extra bearings and\r\ngear generally used are employed. In this respect the direct action\r\nmachines undoubtedly have an advantage, but an advantage of any kind may\r\nbe too dearly bought, as it certainly is here.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the direct action can only be applied to a\r\nrear-steering, clutch-driven machine, or single driver, for if the\r\nwheels were not free to run ahead, it would be impossible to go round a\r\ncurve. In the second place, the rider must be placed at such a height\r\nfor his feet to work on the axle that the machine, of necessity, is very\r\nunstable, and is likely to upset if ridden without great caution round\r\na curve. Thirdly, to diminish as far as possible this last objection,\r\nmiserable little wheels must be employed, which cannot be geared up,\r\nthat is, made to travel faster than the treadles, and so be equivalent\r\nto larger wheels. Therefore, though it is likely that at such low speeds\r\nonly as it is safe to run such a machine it may move more easily than a\r\nmachine of a recognized type, and though direct action would undoubtedly\r\nbe advantageous if it did not entail defects of a most serious order of\r\nmagnitude, we may dismiss this at once from our consideration. It is\r\ntrue that in the Monarch a few inches of height are gained by the\r\nhanging pedals, but I question very much whether one machine is much\r\nbetter than the other.\r\n\r\nThe chain which is used on almost every make of machine cannot be\r\nconsidered perfect; it is, on the whole, a dirty and noisy contrivance,\r\ngiving rise to friction where the links take and leave the teeth of\r\nthe pulleys; stretching, or rather lengthening, by wear, and, finally,\r\nallowing back lash, which is most unpleasant. In spite of all this, it\r\naffords a convenient and reliable means of transmitting power, which is\r\napplicable to every type of tricycle, except one.\r\n\r\nInstead of a chain, an intermediate or idle wheel has been tried, but\r\nthis has not been found advantageous. The intermediate wheel has been\r\nremoved, and the crank and wheel pulley allowed to gear directly\r\ntogether, making reverse motion of the feet necessary, and possibly\r\nreducing friction.\r\n\r\nThe crank and connecting rod are employed in some machines. If there are\r\ntwo only, they must not be placed in opposite positions, but be fixed at\r\nan angle, so that there are times when each rod is under compression,\r\na strain which delicate rods cannot stand. In the three-throw crank,\r\nemployed in the Matchless tricycle, this objection is obviated, for one,\r\nat least, is at all times in such a position as to be in tension. The\r\nobjection to the crank is the fact that it weakens the shaft, and that\r\nit can only be used with a clutch, not with a differential gear.\r\n\r\nThe most silent, neatest, and cleanest driver, the one of which the\r\nworking friction is least, is the endless steel band, so well known in\r\nconnection with the Otto bicycle. This is not, as far as I am aware,\r\nemployed on any tricycle, makers probably fearing lest it should slip.\r\nThe Otto shows that it can safely be employed.\r\n\r\nI have devised a scheme, of which I now show a model, which seems to me\r\nto be free from the objections which may be urged against other methods;\r\nbut I, of course, cannot be considered in this respect a judge.\r\nEccentrics are well known as equivalent to cranks, but if used in the\r\nsame way, with a connecting rod, either fatal friction or enormous\r\nball-bearings would be necessary. Instead of these, I connect two pair\r\nof equal eccentrics by an endless band embracing each, so that the band\r\nacts like a connecting rod without friction, and, at the same time,\r\nacts by its turning power as on the Otto, thus making two eccentrics\r\nsufficient instead of three, and carrying them over the dead points.\r\n\r\nThere is one more system of transmitting power employed on a few\r\nmachines. In these, a band or line passes over the circumference of a\r\nsector or wheel, and the power is directly applied to it. The motion of\r\nthe feet in the omnicycle, and of the hands and body in the Oarsman, is\r\ntherefore uniform. There would be no harm in this if it were not for the\r\nstarting and the stopping, which cannot be gradual and at the same time\r\neffective in machines of this type. For this reason, a high speed cannot\r\nbe obtained; nevertheless, these machines are better able to climb hills\r\nthan are tricycles with the usual rotary motion, for, at all parts of\r\nthe stroke--which may be of any length that the rider chooses--his\r\ndriving power on the wheels is equal. The ingenious expanding drums on\r\nthe omnicycle make this machine exceptionally good in this respect, for\r\nincreased leverage is effected without increased friction, which is the\r\nresult of \"putting on the power\" in some of the two-speed contrivances.\r\n\r\nHaving spoken of the Oarsman tricycle, I must express regret that I have\r\nnot been able to find an opportunity to ride on or with the machine, so\r\nthat I cannot from observation form an opinion of its going qualities.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the enormous amount of work that can be got\r\nfrom the body in each stroke on a sliding seat in a boat must, applied\r\nin the same manner on the Oarsman tricycle, make it shoot away in a\r\nsurprising manner; whether such motion, when continued for hours, is\r\nmore tiring than the ordinary leg motion only, I cannot say for certain,\r\nbut I should imagine that it would be. The method by which the steering\r\nis effected by the feet, and can with one foot be locked to a rigidly\r\nstraight course, is especially to be admired.\r\n\r\nThere is much difference of opinion with respect to the most suitable\r\nsize for the wheels of machines. Except with certain machines, this has\r\nnothing to do with the speed at which the machine will travel at a given\r\nrate of pedaling, for the wheels may be geared up or down to any extent,\r\nthat is made to turn more quickly or slowly than the cranks. Thus the\r\nmost suitable speeding is a separate question, and must be treated by\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nLarge wheels are far superior to small wheels in allowing comfortable,\r\neasy motion, a matter of considerable importance in a long journey. They\r\nare also far better than small for running over loose or muddy ground,\r\nfor with a given weight upon them they sink in less, from the longer\r\nbearing they present, and this, combined with their less curvature,\r\nmakes the everlasting ascent which the mud presents to them far less\r\nthan with a smaller wheel. On the other hand, the large wheel is\r\nheavier, and suffers more from air resistance than the small wheel. For\r\nracing purposes a little wheel, geared up of course, is certainly better\r\nthan a high wheel; for comfortable traveling, and in general, the high\r\nwheel is preferable. Though this is certainly the case, it does not\r\nfollow that large wheels are worth having on a machine when there is\r\nalready one little wheel. If the rider is to be worried with the evils\r\nof a little wheel at all, it is possible that any advantage which large\r\nwheels would give him would be swamped by the vibration and mud-sticking\r\nproperties of the small steering wheel. One firm, in their endeavors\r\nto minimize these evils, have designed machines without any very small\r\nwheels; all three wheels are large, and a steadier and more comfortable\r\nmotion no doubt results.\r\n\r\nHigh and low gearing are the natural sequel to high and low wheels. Of\r\ncourse the lower the gearing the greater is the mechanical advantage in\r\nfavor of the rider when meeting with much resistance, whether from wind,\r\nmud, or steepness of slope. In spite of this, for some reason which I\r\ncannot divine, the machines with excessively low gear do not seem to\r\nobtain so great an advantage in climbing hills as might be expected. To\r\nmake such a machine travel at a moderate speed only, excessively rapid\r\npedaling is necessary, and the rider is made tired more by the motion of\r\nhis legs than by any work he is doing. The slow, steady stroke by which\r\na rider propels a high-geared machine is far more graceful and less\r\nwearying than the furious motion which is necessary on a low-geared\r\nmachine. The height up to which the driving-wheels are usually geared\r\nmay be taken as an indication of the ease with which any class of\r\nmachines runs. A rider on a low-geared machine can start his machine\r\nmuch more quickly than an equal man on one that has high gearing, and\r\ntherefore in a race he has an advantage at first, which he speedily\r\nloses as his rapid pedaling begins to tell. For ordinary riding the\r\nslight loss of time at starting is a matter of no importance whatever.\r\n\r\nThere are several devices which enable us to obtain the advantages of\r\nhigh and low gearing on the same machine, which at the same time give\r\nthe rider the benefit of a free pedal whenever he wishes. On some single\r\ndriving rear-steering tricycles the connection on one side is for speed,\r\nand that on the other for power, either being in action at the wish of\r\nthe rider, or both speed and power combinations are applied on the same\r\nside. To drive with a power gear a single wheel only seems to me to be\r\nthe height of folly; in my opinion no arrangement of this type is worthy\r\nof serious attention. Among the better class of machines there are three\r\nmethods by which this change is effected--first, that employed on the\r\nomnicycle, to which I have already referred; secondly, an epicyclic\r\ncombination of wheelwork which moves as one piece when set for speed,\r\nthus adding nothing to the working friction except by its weight, but\r\nwhich works internally when set for power, thus reducing to a small\r\nextent, by the additional friction, the gain of power which the rider\r\ndesires; thirdly, a double set of chains and pulleys, each set always in\r\nmovement, so that, whether set for speed or power, there is rather more\r\nfriction than there would be if there were no additional chains, but\r\nthese are free from that increased friction due to toothed wheel\r\ngearing, from which the epicyclic contrivances suffer only when set\r\nfor power. There is much difference of opinion whether any of these\r\narrangements are worth carrying, for perhaps nine miles, for the sake of\r\nany advantage that may be obtained in the tenth. It is on this account\r\nthat the drums on the omnicycle are so excellent; whether expanded or\r\nnot, there is, on their account, no loss of work whatever, for there is\r\nno additional friction. The subject of these two speed gears will, I\r\nhope, be discussed; it is one which, though not new, is coming more to\r\nthe front, and about which much may be said.\r\n\r\nHaving now dealt with the means by which tricycles are made to climb\r\nhills more easily, I wish to leave the subject of bicycles and tricycles\r\naltogether for a few minutes, to say a few words which may specially\r\ninterest those who are fond of trying their power in riding up our best\r\nknown hills. The difficulty of getting up depends to a large extent on\r\nthe surface and on the wind, but chiefly on the steepness. The vague\r\nmanner in which one hill is compared with another, and the wild ideas\r\nthat many hold who have not made any measurements, induces me to\r\ndescribe a method which I have found specially applicable for the\r\nmeasurement of steepness of any hill on which a cyclist may find\r\nhimself, and also a scheme for the complete representation of the\r\nsteepness and elevation of every part of a hill on a map so as to be\r\ntaken in at a glance. The force required to move the thing up a slope is\r\ndirectly proportional not to the angle, but to the trigonometrical sine\r\nof that angle. To measure this, place the tricycle, or Otto--a\r\nbicycle will not stand square to the road, and therefore cannot be\r\nused--pointing in direction at right angles to the slope of the hill, so\r\nthat it will not tend to move. Clip on the top of the wheel a level, and\r\nmark that part of the road which is in the line of sight. Take a string\r\nmade up of pieces alternately black and white, each exactly as long as\r\nthe wheel is high, and stretch it between the mark and the top of the\r\nwheel. If there are n pieces of string included, the slope is 1 in n,\r\nfor by similar triangles the diameter of the wheel is to the length of\r\nthe string as the vertical rise is to the distance on the road. This\r\ngives the average steepness of a piece sufficiently long to be worth\r\ntesting, because an incline only a few feet in length, of almost any\r\nsteepness, can be mounted by the aid of momentum.\r\n\r\nThere is only one process, with which I am acquainted, which supplies a\r\nmethod of representing on a map the steepness of a road at every part.\r\nContours, of course, show how far one has to go to rise 50 or 100 feet,\r\nbut as to whether the ascent is made uniformly or in an irregular\r\nmanner, with steep and level places, they tell us nothing. Let the\r\ncourse of a road be indicated by a single line where it is level, and by\r\na pair of lines where inclined. Let the distance between the lines be\r\neverywhere proportional to the steepness, then the greatest width will\r\nshow the steepest part, and an intermediate width will show places\r\nof intermediate steepness; the crossing of the lines, which must be\r\ndistinguishable from one another, will show where the direction of the\r\nslope changes. Further, the size of the figure bounded by the two lines\r\nwill show the total rise; a great height being reached only by great\r\nsteepness or by great length, a large figure being formed only by great\r\nwidth or by great length. Those who are mathematically inclined will\r\nrecognize here that I have differentiated the curve representing the\r\nslope of the bill, and laid the differential curve down in plan.\r\n\r\nHaving wandered off my subject, I must return to more mechanical things,\r\nand give the results of some experiments which I have made on the balls\r\nof ball bearings. There is no necessity to argue the case of ball vs.\r\nplain bearings, the balls have so clearly won their case, that it would\r\nbe waste of time to show why. Of the wear of the twelve balls forming\r\none set belonging to the bearings of the wheels of my Otto, I have on a\r\nprevious occasion spoken; I may, however, repeat that in running 1,000\r\nmiles, the twelve balls lost in weight only 1/20.8 grain, or each ball\r\nlost only 1/250 grain. The wear of the surface amounted to only 1/158000\r\ninch; at the same rate of wear, the loss in traveling from here to the\r\nmoon would amount to only 1/34.3 of their weight. I examined each ball\r\nevery 200 miles, and was surprised to find that on the whole the wear of\r\neach, during each journey, varied very little. The balls experimented on\r\nwere a new set obtained from Mr. Bown. I also had from him one ball of\r\neach of each of the following sizes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 16ths of an inch\r\nin diameter, as I was curious to know what weight they would suppport\r\nwithout crushing. As as preliminary experiment, I placed a spare 5/16\r\nball between the crushing faces of the new testing machine at South\r\nKensington, and applied a gradually increasing force up to 7 tons 9½\r\ncwt., at which it showed no signs of distress. On removing it I found\r\nthat it had buried itself over an angle of about 60° in the hard steel\r\nfaces, faces so hard that a file would not touch them. Those marks will\r\nbe a permanent record of the stuff of which the ball was made. The ball\r\nitself is sealed in a tube, so that any one who is curious to see it can\r\ndo so. Finding that the crushing faces were not sufficiently hard, I\r\nmade two anvils of the best tool steel, and very carefully hardened\r\nthem. These, though they were impressed slightly, were sufficiently good\r\nfor the purpose. In the following table are the results of the crushing\r\nexperiments:\r\n\r\n3/16 ball at 2 tons 13 cwt. did not break, but crushed on removing part\r\nof the weight.\r\n\r\n¼ ball at 3 tons 15 cwt. did not break, but crushed on removing part of\r\nthe weight.\r\n\r\n5/16 ball at 4 tons 9 cwt. broke.\r\n\r\n3/8 ball at 8 tons 6 cwt. did not break, crushed under another 120 lb.\r\n\r\n7/16 ball crushed before 3 tons, with which I was starting, had been\r\napplied. Examination showed that the steel bar of which it was made had\r\nbeen laminated.\r\n\r\nThese experiments do not tell much of importance; they are curious,\r\nand perhaps of sufficient interest to bring before your notice. The\r\nfragments are all preserved in tubes, and labeled, so that any one who\r\nlikes to see them can do so.\r\n\r\nOf the advantage which a machine which will collapse or fold up when\r\ndesired, but retain its form on the road, offers in convenience, it is\r\nunnecessary for me to speak.\r\n\r\nOf double machines, the Rucker tandem bicycle seems to me to be in every\r\nrespect the best, but I should add that I speak only from imagination\r\nand not from experience. The independent steering, the impossibility of\r\ncapsizing forward or sideways, the position of the rider over his work,\r\nthe absence of any little wheel with its mud throwing and vibrating\r\ntendencies, combine to make a machine which ought to be superior in\r\nalmost every desirable quality to any other; what it may be in practice\r\nI hope to hear in the discussion.\r\n\r\nOf double tricycles, the Sociable has been tried by many, and is\r\npractically a failure in so far as traveling quickly and easily\r\nis concerned. The Tandem, though it presents so objectionable an\r\nappearance, seems likely to become a favorite, for it surpasses any\r\nsingle tricycle, and rivals the bicycle in speed. How it may compare in\r\ncomfort or in safety with the single machine, perhaps those few who are\r\nwell acquainted with them will say; at any rate, in the case of the\r\nHumber, greater stability is given to the steering, owing to the weight\r\nof the front rider.\r\n\r\nTime will not allow me to say more of these machines, or to attack the\r\nsubject of steam, electric, or magic tricycles, which I had hoped to do.\r\nWith steam and electricity we are well acquainted; by magic tricycles, I\r\nmean those driven by a motor which, without any expense, will drive one\r\ntwenty miles an hour, up or down hill, with perfect safety. Highway\r\nregulations, and certain reasons not well understood, have at present\r\nprevented these contrivances from making a revolution.\r\n\r\nThere remains one machine which must be considered separately, for it\r\ncannot be classed with any other. This is the Otto bicycle. My opinion\r\nof this machine is so pronounced that I do not care to state it fully. I\r\nshall merely give the reasons why I prefer it to anything else, and in\r\nso doing I shall be taking the first step in the discussion, in which it\r\nwill be interesting to hear from riders of other machines the reasons\r\nfor their preference.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the evils of a third or little wheel, the cause of\r\ntrouble in all tricycles, are avoided. There is none of the vibration\r\nwhich makes all other machines almost unbearable to Ottoists, vibration\r\nwhich tricyclists have learnt to consider a necessary accompaniment of\r\ncycling, but which has, no doubt, been diminished by the use of the\r\nspring support of the front steering Humber. It would be presumptuous\r\nin me to make any remarks on the effect of this vibration on the human\r\nsystem; we shall all be anxious to hear what our Chairman has to say on\r\nthis point. By having only two wheels, we have only two tracks, so that\r\nwe can travel at a fair speed along those places in the country called\r\nroads, which consist of alternate lines of ruts and stones, where a\r\nthree-track machine could not be driven, and where, from the quantity\r\nof loose limestone in the ruts, a little wheel of a two-track tricycle\r\nwould be likely to suffer. By having no little wheel, we can ride in\r\ndirty weather without having the rest of our machine pelted with mud, so\r\nthat cleaning takes less time than it does with anything else. As I have\r\nalready remarked, the small wheel is the culprit which makes the bicycle\r\nand tricycle drive so heavily on a soft road. The ease with which the\r\nOtto can therefore be run through the mud astonishes every one. Having\r\nno little wheel, we can obtain the full advantage of the high 56\r\ninch wheel, which almost every one prefers. As I have ridden all\r\ncombinations, from a 50 inch geared up to 60 inch, to a 60 inch geared\r\nlevel, I can speak from experience of the increased comfort to be\r\nderived from these large wheels, though for speed only they do not\r\ncompare with the smaller and lighter wheels geared up. A further point\r\ngained by the use of two wheels only is the fact that the whole weight\r\nof machine and rider is on the driving-wheel, as it is also on the\r\nsteering-wheel, so that by no possibility can the wheels be made to slip\r\nin the driving, or to fail in steering from want of pressure upon them.\r\n\r\nThe most important consequence, however, is the absence of any fixed\r\nframe. In all machines, bicycles and tricycles, with the usual fixed\r\nframe, a position is found for the saddle which is, on the whole, most\r\nsuitable. For some particular gradient it will be perfect; on a steeper\r\ngradient the treadles will be further in advance, but with a steeper\r\ngradient the rider should be more over the front of the treadles. To get\r\nhis weight further to the front, he has to double up in the middle, and\r\nassume a position in which he cannot possibly work to advantage. The\r\nswinging frame of the Otto carries the treadles, of necessity, further\r\nback, so that the Ottoist, when working at his hardest, is still\r\nupright, with his hands in the line between his shoulders, and his feet\r\nand his arms straight, so that he can hold himself down, and employ his\r\nstrength in a perfectly natural position. On going down a slope, the\r\nfixed frame of a bicycle or tricycle leans forward, and places the rider\r\nin such a position that extra weight is thrown on his arms and his\r\nshoulders, whereas the swing frame of the Otto goes back, and the rider\r\nof necessity assumes that position in which his arms are relieved of all\r\nstrain. In so far as the general position taken by the automatic Otto\r\nframe is concerned, nearly the same effect can be obtained by using the\r\nswing frame of the Devon tricycle, which can be shifted and locked in\r\nany position which the rider wishes, or by the sliding saddle, which can\r\nbe slid backward or forward and locked so as to place the rider in one\r\nof three positions. Though the rider can by these devices assume nearly\r\nthat position with respect to the treadles which is most advantageous,\r\nhe cannot obtain that curious fore and aft oscillation made use of by\r\nthe Ottoist in climbing hills, which, as the model on the table shows,\r\nenables him to get past the dead points without even moving, and which,\r\ntherefore, makes the Otto by far the best hill-climbing machine there\r\nis, if account is taken of the high speeding with which all Ottoists\r\nride. This is a proposition which none who knows the machine will\r\nquestion for one moment.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of motion resulting from the swing of the frame of the Otto\r\ngives a pleasurable sensation, which those who have only experienced the\r\nconstrained motion of a three-wheeler cannot even understand.\r\n\r\nThe very peculiar method of driving and steering, which seems so\r\npuzzling to the novice, especially if he is a good rider of other\r\nmachines--for in that case he is far worse off than one who has never\r\nridden anything--give the rider, when he is familiar with them, a\r\ncontrol over the machine which is still surprising to me. In the first\r\nplace, the machine will run along straight, backward or forward, so\r\nlong as the handles are let alone. This automatic straight running is a\r\nluxury, for until a deviation has to be made, the steering handles need\r\nnot be touched, and the rider may, if sufficiently confident, travel\r\nwith his arms folded or his hands in his pockets. The rigid connection\r\nbetween the cranks and the wheels does away with all the backlash,\r\nwhich is so unpleasant with chain or toothed wheel gearing. There is no\r\ndifferential gear or clutch, but the machine possesses the advantage\r\nof the clutch over the differential gear when meeting with unequal\r\nresistance on a straight course, for each wheel must travel at the same\r\nspeed; but, in turning a corner, instead of driving the inner wheel\r\nonly, which is done by the clutch or both wheels equally, which is the\r\ncase with differential gear, each wheel is driven, but the outer one\r\nmore than the inner. At high speeds, the steering of the Otto has this\r\nadvantage, that whereas, with a given action on a tricyle, the same\r\ndeviation will be effected in the same _space_ at high as at low speeds,\r\nthe same action on the Otto will, at high speeds, produce the same\r\ndeviation in the same _time_ as it does at low speeds; and so instead of\r\nbecoming more sensitive at high speeds, as is the case with the tricyle,\r\nthe steering of the Otto remains the same. This is because the steering\r\nof the tricycle depends on a kinematical, that of the Otto on a\r\ndynamical principle.\r\n\r\nIn another respect, no machine can approach the Otto; at almost any\r\nspeed the rider can, if there is reason, instantly dismount, by which\r\naction he puts on the brakes, and the machine will save him from\r\nfalling, stopping with him almost instantly. As is well known, we can\r\nmove backward and forward, we can twist around and around in our own\r\nwidth, or can ride over bricks with impunity.\r\n\r\nOne objection to the machine is the difficulty of learning, which is\r\nconsiderable, but which presents no danger. This difficulty has been\r\nmuch exaggerated, for before the present powerful brake was applied it\r\ndid require considerable skill to ride it down a steep hill. The way\r\nto do this must still be learnt, but it is now comparatively easy. For\r\ngoing down steep hills, the front steering tricycle is without a rival;\r\nI do not know what other machine will do this better than the Otto.\r\nLastly, the foot straps, which would be a great advantage on any\r\nmachine, if only they were safe, are not--though none but riders will\r\nbelieve it--in any way a source of danger on the Otto. Having ridden\r\nthis machine for close upon 10,000 miles, I can speak with more\r\nauthority on this point than can those who are not able to sit upon it\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage which the machine presents is the fact that it is\r\nimpossible to remove the feet from the pedals while running, without\r\ndismounting; but though they must at all times follow the pedals, the\r\nOttoist is not, as is generally thought, working when descending a hill.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic terms in which every one who has mastered the\r\npeculiarities of the Otto speaks of it would be considered as evidence\r\nin its favor, if we were not all considered by other cyclists to be in\r\nvarious stages of lunacy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANAL IRON WORKS, LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome interest is awakened in engineering circles in London, just now, by\r\nthe approaching close of the old engineering works so well known as the\r\n\"Canal Ironworks,\" at the entrance to the Isle of Dogs, London, E. This\r\nnotable establishment stands second in priority in London--that of\r\nMessrs. Maudslay, Sons & Field being the oldest--for the manufacture of\r\nmarine engines. It was founded by the late Messrs. Seawards, above sixty\r\nyears ago. Here was originated Seaward's hoisting \"sheers\" with the\r\ntraveling back leg, a modern example of which, 100 feet high, in iron,\r\nstands on the wharf. An interesting tool, also, is the large vertical\r\nboring machine for largest size cylinders; Seaward spent £5,000 upon\r\nthis, and it is certainly an admirable tool. There is also the large\r\nvertical slotting machine, with a stroke up to 5 feet 2 inches, a\r\nwonderfully powerful and compact machine. The extensive collection of\r\nscrewing tackle is, perhaps, unsurpassed, and extends up to 8 inches\r\ndiameter. There is a peculiar erecting shop roof, which will still repay\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINONI'S ROTARY PRINTING PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest progress that has been made in recent years in the art\r\nof printing is in the invention of the high speed press provided with\r\ncontinuous paper.\r\n\r\nThree French constructors, Messrs. Marinoni, Alauzet, and Derriey, have\r\nbrought this kind of apparatus to such a degree of perfection that\r\nthe majority of foreign journals having a large circulation buy their\r\npresses in France. We reproduce in Fig. 1 a perspective view of the\r\nMarinoni press, and in Fig. 2 a diagram showing the parts of the same.\r\nIn order to give a complete description of it, we cannot do better than\r\nto reproduce the very interesting study that has been made of it by Mr.\r\nMonet, a civil engineer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--MARINONI'S ROTARY PRINTING PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe roller, J (Fig. 2), is placed in the machine in the state in which\r\nit is received from the paper manufactory. The paper unwinds, runs over\r\nthe rollers, e and e', which serve only for tautening it, and then\r\npasses between the two cylinders, A and B. The cylinder, A, carries the\r\nform, and B carries the blanket, and the paper thus receives its first\r\nimpression. It afterward passes between the cylinders, A' and B', and\r\nreceives an impression on the other side, the cylinder, A', carrying the\r\nform, and B' the blanket. Being now printed on both sides, it passes\r\nbetween the cylinders, KK', which cut it off and allow the sheet to\r\nslide between the cords of the rollers. These latter lead the sheets\r\nover the rollers, g h, on which they wind, one over the other, when the\r\nrollers, a a', are in the position shown by unbroken lines in the cut.\r\n\r\nThe part of the machine that holds the rollers, g h, and the different\r\ncords that wind over them, is the _accumulator_, and it is in this part\r\nof the press that the sheets accumulate, one over the other, to any\r\nnumber desired.\r\n\r\nThe size of the rollers, g h, and their distance apart are so regulated\r\nthat when the sheet reaches the accumulator, it falls exactly on those\r\nthat have preceded it. When the proper number of sheets is in the\r\naccumulator (4 or 5 being the number most employed for afterward\r\nfacilitating the separation into packets on the receiving table), the\r\ntwo small rollers, a a', advance over the rack, N, and the sheets,\r\ninstead of continuing to roll over into the accumulator, fall on the\r\nrack and are deposited by it upon the receiving table, O.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--MARINONI'S PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe rack having fallen twenty times, and deposited five sheets each\r\ntime, or one hundred in all, the table moves in such a way as to prevent\r\nthe sheets subsequently deposited from getting mixed with them. When the\r\nrack has fallen twenty times, the table returns to its initial position.\r\n\r\nThe distributing rollers, D, come in contact with the inking rollers, I,\r\nonce during each revolution of the printing cylinders, and are mounted\r\non racking levers provided with regulating screws that permit of easily\r\nregulating the amount of ink taken up. The supports of the inking\r\nrollers are movable and can be made to approach or recede from the\r\ndistributing rollers, so as to still further vary the amount of ink\r\ntaken up by them.\r\n\r\nThe distributing rollers supply the ink to a roller, E, of large\r\ndiameter, which, having a backward and forward motion, begins to\r\ndistribute the ink and to transmit it to a second roller, F, of the same\r\ndiameter. This latter then spreads it over a metallic cylinder, G, which\r\nis of the same diameter as the printing cylinders, and against which\r\nrevolve three distributing rollers, H, that have a backward and forward\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nBetween the cylindrical inking table, G, and the type cylinder, there\r\nare situated inking cylinders, T, of large diameter, that constantly\r\ntake up ink from the inking table and distribute it over the types.\r\n\r\nThe machine here described, when designed for printing large sized\r\njournals, has cylinders whose circumference corresponds to the size of\r\npaper for two widths of pages, and whose length is sufficient to allow\r\nit to receive two forms. Each cylinder, then, carries four forms, or\r\neight in all, and prints two complete copies at each revolution.\r\n\r\nThe large sheet cut off by the cylinders, K K', contains, then, two\r\ncopies; and this sheet, on passing under the roller, f is again cut in\r\ntwo by a disk which separates it in a direction perpendicular to the\r\ncylinders.\r\n\r\nTo this press there may be added a mechanical folder of Mr. Marinoni's\r\ninvention, capable of folding a journal five times.--_Annales\r\nIndustrielles_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHENOT'S ECONOMIC FILTER PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. E. Chenot, who is occupied in the manufacture of wine from dry\r\ngrapes, has been led to devise a new style of filter, which by reason of\r\nits mode of action and its construction, he calls the \"Economic Filter\r\nPress.\"\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, which is shown in the accompanying cut, consists of flat\r\nbags whose mouth may be at the top, as usual, or at the side. Through\r\nthis orifice there is introduced a flat piece of wood or metal, which,\r\nlike the bag, has an aperture through the center. The whole is suspended\r\nfrom a distributing pipe that is fixed at one end to the frame and is\r\nfree at the other. This pipe is slotted beneath, and the pieces of wood\r\nor metal contain, opposite the slot, a number of small apertures that\r\nput the distributer in communication with the interior of the bags.\r\nBetween these latter there are placed wire cloth frames which hold them\r\nin position and facilitate the flow of the filtered liquid. The cut\r\nshows the filter provided with a portion of its bags and frames. When\r\nall the frames are in place they are locked by causing the movable plate\r\nto move forward by means of two screws connected with an endless chain\r\nand actuated by a hand wheel. The pressure of this plate closes up the\r\nbags hermetically. Then, the feed cock being opened, the liquid flows\r\ninto all the bags, deposits therein what it holds in suspension, and the\r\nclarified product flows to the inclined bottom of the filter and from\r\nthence to the exterior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHENOT'S ECONOMIC FILTER PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus may be supplied either through an upper reservoir, a juice\r\nelevator, or a pump. The discharge is proportional to the square root\r\nof the pressure. When the bags are full of residuum, the feed cock is\r\nclosed, the filter is unscrewed, and the bags and frames are taken out.\r\nWith fresh bags and the same frames, it is possible to at once set the\r\napparatus in operation again.\r\n\r\nBefore the filter is taken apart, the residuum may be exhausted by\r\nwashing it either with water or steam, or by pressure. To effect the\r\noperation by pressure, the pieces of wood or metal are removed, the\r\nmouths are closed by making a fold in the top of the bags, and the\r\nlatter are then put back into the apparatus or into an ordinary press\r\nand submitted to another squeezing.\r\n\r\nTo render the maneuvering of it easier, the apparatus has been given a\r\nhorizontal position.--_Revue Industrielle_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[American Engineer]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEEL CHAINS WITHOUT WELDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe take the following description, together with the illustrations, of\r\na method and machine for making steel chain without welding, from our\r\nvalued contemporary, _Le Genie Civil_, of Paris:\r\n\r\nWhen we regard an ordinary oval-linked chain endwise, it presents itself\r\nin the form of a metal cross, and it was this that gave the cue to M.\r\nOury, of the Government Arsenals, to construct chain without welding. By\r\na series of matrices and punches, etc., he contrives, with small loss of\r\nmetal, to model a chain out of cross-shaped steel bar.\r\n\r\nSteel is the better material for such usage, from its homogeneity, both\r\nas to composition and strength.\r\n\r\nReferring to the plate below, Figs. 1 to 10 explain the successive steps\r\nfrom the bar to the finished chain.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows in plan and section the steel bar, whose length may be some\r\n40 feet, and which would make a chain say 50 feet long. The shape of the\r\nbar presents no difficulties in the way of rolling.\r\n\r\nFigs. 2 and 3 give, in side elevations of the two faces and sections,\r\nthe first rough form of the links. These first begin to take the\r\nexterior shape with the rounding of the angles.\r\n\r\nThe operations following, represented by Figs. 4 and 5, is the piercing\r\nof the center of the links, which can later be furnished with a stay for\r\nsuch chains as require special strength. The point now is to detach the\r\nlinks, which is accomplished by oblique piercings, as shown in Fig. 6.\r\nIn the operation represented by Fig. 7, the oval shape is imparted to\r\nthe link, and the operation finishes as shown in Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nActually, the links are circular and separate. This separation is\r\nretarded as much as possible, for it is plain that it is easier\r\nto operate a rigid bar than a chain, above all when the operation\r\nnecessitates its being pushed forward.\r\n\r\nBy means of a good system of heating, analogous to that employed on the\r\nlarge parts entering into ship construction, it is hoped to perform a\r\nmajor part of the operations, of which we have given but an idea, at a\r\nsingle heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINE FOR MAKING CHAIN WITHOUT WELDING.]\r\n\r\nThese operations require work on both faces alternately--this presents\r\nno difficulties; but what appears to us most difficult to realize is\r\n_continuous work_, the bar passing through several machines which\r\nsuccessively impress upon it the steps of progress toward the finished\r\nchain. If the machines are end on to each other in a direct line, there\r\nwill necessarily be a fixed place for each tool; the rough cut chain\r\nmust accurately reach the point where another tool is ready to continue\r\nthe modeling. This appears to us practically impossible, the more so as\r\nthe elongation which the bar takes at each stamp varies with its initial\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nWhat is more admissible is that with one heat and in the same machine an\r\noperation could be performed on the two faces perpendicularly. The bar\r\ncould then be taken from one furnace and put in another immediately,\r\nto pass at once to another machine to again undergo the operations\r\nfollowing. The work could then be done rapidly, submitting the bar to\r\nseveral heats.\r\n\r\nA few words on the tools as they exist.\r\n\r\nThe most important principle to note, and on which the different\r\nmachines employed are designed, is this: The punches or matrices acting\r\non the chain at its different points of progress are put in motion by\r\nspiral springs worked by means of tappets or cams distributed over the\r\ncircumference of a cylinder, having a rotary movement imparted to it by\r\npulleys and belts.\r\n\r\nThe figures on our plate show with sufficient clearness the working of\r\none of these machines. It will be seen that the bar traverses through\r\nand through the machine for stamping, and that it can be disengaged for\r\na reheating before passing to subsequent operations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bog peat of Mexico is now being used on a considerable scale as fuel\r\nfor locomotives, stationary engines, smelting purposes, smiths' fires,\r\nand househould use.

H. BUNGENER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle that is definite is known of the substance or substances to\r\nwhich the hop owes its bitterness. Lermer has succeeded, it is true, in\r\nseparating from hops a crystallized colorless substance, insoluble in\r\nwater, an alkaline solution of which has a marked bitter flavor, and\r\nwhich easily changes on exposure to the air, assuming a resinous form.\r\nAccording to Lermer, the formula of this substance is C_{32}H_{50}O_{7};\r\nit possesses the properties of a weak acid and forms a characteristic\r\ncopper salt, which is soluble in ether. This hop bitter is, however,\r\nproduced from the hop by a very roundabout process, by treatment of the\r\nextract with alkalies; it is not therefore regarded by many as present\r\nin this form in the hop, and they hold that it is only produced by\r\nthe action of the alkalies. On the other hand, however, Etti, by a\r\ncomplicated extracting process, but without using an alkali, succeeded\r\nin producing a bitter substance from hops, which is, however, soluble in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nSeveral experiments convinced me that there really existed in hops a\r\ncrystallizable substance, insoluble in water, the alcoholic and alkaline\r\nsolution of which had a bitter flavor, in short, which possessed all\r\nthe properties of Lermer's hop bitter acid. Petroleum ether is the best\r\npractical solvent in use for its isolation, as it does not dissolve\r\nthe majority of the remaining constituents of the hop, especially the\r\nhop-resin, which they contain in considerable quantity. Still, the\r\nextraction of hop-bitter acid from hops is a troublesome and thankless\r\njob, the petroleum ether taking up certain substances which add greatly\r\nto the difficulty of purifying the crystals. On the other hand, we can\r\nreadily and quickly attain our object, if we employ for our original\r\nmaterial fresh lupuline from unsulphured hops.\r\n\r\nThe following process has furnished me the best results:\r\n\r\nThe lupuline is first freed from gross impurities (hop-seed leaves,\r\netc.), and then covered with petroleum ether boiling at a low\r\ntemperature (40° to 70°) in stoppered flasks. The mixture is shaken up\r\nfrom time to time. After twenty-four hours, by means of a Zullowsky\r\nfilter immersed in the mass, and with the aid of a suction-pump, the\r\ndark brown solution is drawn off; then fresh ether is poured on to the\r\nlupuline, and it is allowed to stand for another twenty-four hours.\r\nAfter this process has been three times repeated, nearly everything the\r\npetroleum will dissolve has probably been extracted. The solutions are\r\nput together, and the petroleum ether distilled off _in vacuo_ at a low\r\ntemperature, until there remains in the flask a dark brown sirup, which\r\non cooling solidifies into a crystalline mass. This is pulverized and\r\nturned on to a filter composed of a large funnel, in which a smaller\r\nfunnel covered with muslin is inserted. With the aid of a suction-pump,\r\nthe greater portion of the thick, crude solution can be filtered\r\nthrough. There remains on the filter a highly colored crystalline\r\n\"cake,\" which should be pulverized with a small quantity of petroleum\r\nether and again filtered. After this operation has been repeated three\r\nor four times, we obtain an almost colorless mass, consisting of\r\nhop-bitter acid, contaminated by small quantities of a fatty substance,\r\nand a substance which I could not isolate, and which I had at first\r\ngreat trouble in separating from the hop-bitter acid.\r\n\r\nIf we do not wish to utilize this crude substance at once, it will be\r\nnecessary to melt it in the water bath and pour it into a bottle under\r\nclose seal, where it will at once crystallize and solidify. If it\r\nremains exposed to the atmosphere, it will soon become sticky and\r\nturn partly into resin. Six kilos of lupuline, which included a large\r\nproportion of sand, furnished 400 grammes of crude hop-bitter acid. The\r\nfirst experiments in crystallization with petroleum ether gave poor\r\nresults; it is difficult to produce the acid pure in large quantities\r\nby this process, as a small quantity of the above substance obstinately\r\nclings to it, and it readily assumes a non-crystallizable form. Our\r\nobject is more readily attained if we crystallize it once from alcohol,\r\nfor which purpose we dissolve it in a little lukewarm alcohol, then\r\nquickly cool the solution; flakes of a fatty substance will be\r\nseparated, which are removed by filtration with the aid of a\r\nsuction-pump. Then we throw a few small crystals of the acid into the\r\nsolution, and after a short time crystallization commences. As soon as\r\nit appears to be ended, the mother solution is removed with the aid of a\r\nplatinum cone, and the crystals washed with a little cold alcohol. The\r\nalcoholic mother solution, which still contains the chief part of the\r\nbitter acid, must be quickly evaporated, and the residue consigned to\r\na flask. The acid crystallized from the alcohol is then recrystallized\r\nseveral times from petroleum-ether. In order to quickly dissolve the\r\nbitter substance, it should be carefully melted in a flask, and double\r\nits volume of ether gradually added; on its cooling, we obtain beautiful\r\nprismatic crystals, which attain a length of 1 cm., and become perfectly\r\npure after four or five crystallizations. The mother solutions must be\r\nspeedily evaporated if we still wish to obtain crystals; after a time\r\nthey will only furnish a resinous residue.\r\n\r\nThe hop-bitter acid melts at 92° to 93°. It is easily soluble in\r\nalcohol, ether, benzol, chloroform, sulphide of carbon, and vinegar; to\r\na lesser extent in cold petroleum ether, and not at all in water.\r\n\r\nIn the analysis I obtained figures which correspond best with those\r\ncalculated from the formula C_{25}H_{35}O_{4}.\r\n\r\n                                     Obtained.\r\n  Calculated.  ------------------------^-----------------------\r\n  -----^-----  2.

It is difficult to obtain in a pure state, as the\r\nsolutions are readily subject to slight decomposition, accompanied by a\r\nsmall deposit of copper oxide. This combination is readily soluble in\r\nalcohol, to a lesser extent in ether, and is insoluble in water.\r\n\r\nIn the course of analysis, I obtained the following figures:\r\n\r\n   C    69.4 per cent.        69.3  per cent.\r\n   H     7.95     \"            7.98     \"\r\n   Cu    7.20     \"            7.18     \"\r\n\r\nIf we suppose that the copper combines with two molecules of hop-bitter\r\nacid, by the decomposition of one of its atoms, H, we obtain the formula\r\nC_{50}H_{68}O_{8}Cu. This combination will contain 69.87 per cent. C,\r\n7.91 per cent. H, and 7.33 per cent. Cu. The figures obtained do not\r\nperfectly coincide with those calculated; it is nevertheless probable\r\nthat the formula is correct, and the combined substance analyzed was not\r\nperfectly true.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the fact that solutions of hop-bitter acid,\r\nif left standing too long, assume a yellow color, and on evaporation\r\nleave only a yellow resinous residue. This, as its reaction shows,\r\nevinces a complete analogy with the crystallized acid. The dark-colored\r\nmother solution, from which the crystalline cakes of bitter acid are\r\nobtained, contains a large proportion of this resinous compound, which\r\ncan be isolated by treatment with a weak soda-lye; this substance, like\r\nthe crystallized acid, is soluble in alkalies, and can be precipitated\r\nfrom an alkaline solution by an acid. Old hops furnish far less\r\ncrystallizable acid than new hops; from some samples I have been able to\r\nobtain only a few crystals; the remainder had been transformed into the\r\nresinous modification.\r\n\r\nIf pure hop-bitter acid be pulverized and exposed to the atmosphere, it\r\nsoon turns yellow and the surface assumes a resinous consistency. At\r\nthe same time, a more pronounced odor of fatty acids and aldehydes is\r\napparent. Still more rapidly will this oxidation occur if a thin layer\r\nof an alcoholic solution of the acid is allowed to evaporate in the air.\r\nOn the other hand, we can allow hop-oil to stand for days without its\r\nodor being perceptibly changed; it appears to me more than probable that\r\nthe peculiar smell of old hops is due far more to the oxidation of the\r\nbitter substance than to the oxidation of oil.\r\n\r\nHop-bitter acid appears to possess the character of an aldehyde and of\r\na weak acid; for the present I am not in a position to state its\r\nconstitution more clearly. Most of the oxidizing processes have an\r\nenergetic effect on it, forming also considerable quantities of\r\nvalerianic acid.\r\n\r\nThe question as to whether the hop owes chiefly to this acid and its\r\nresinous modifications the property of imparting a pronounced bitter\r\nflavor to a solution, I must for the present leave unanswered. The acid\r\nand its isomer are both insoluble in water; they are, on the other hand,\r\nvery readily dissolved in hop oil; they also furnish a tolerably bitter\r\nsolution, if boiled for a long time in water, probably on their account\r\nof their gradual decomposition. I will not for the present go further\r\ninto the subject, as I hope soon to be in a position to give more\r\ndefinite information.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

The investigator who\r\nfirst explores an unknown region is content if he can in some measure\r\ndelineate its grand features--its rivers, its mountain chains, its\r\nplains; if he be a geologist, he attempts no more than broadly to\r\nobserve its most important rock formations; if a botanist, its more\r\nstriking forms of vegetation. So with the scientific investigator. The\r\nchemist or physicist who discovers a new law seldom succeeds in doing\r\nmore than testing its general accuracy by experiments; it is reserved\r\nfor his successors to note the divergence between his broad and sweeping\r\ngeneralization and particular instances which do not quite accord with\r\nit. So it was with Boyle's law that the volume of a gas varies in\r\ninverse ratio to the pressure to which it is exposed; so it is with the\r\nDarwinian theory, inasmuch as deterioration and degeneration play a part\r\nwhich was, perhaps, at first overlooked; and similar instances may be\r\nfound in almost all pure sciences.\r\n\r\nI conceive that the parallel from the technical point of view is a\r\ndouble one. For just as every technical process cannot be considered\r\nto be beyond improvement, there is always scope for technical\r\ninvestigation; but the true residual phenomena of which I would speak\r\nto-night are waste products. There is, I imagine, no manufacture in\r\nwhich every substance produced meets with a market. Some products are\r\nalways allowed to run to waste, yet it is evident that every effort\r\nconsistent with economy should be made to prevent such waste; and it has\r\nbeen frequently found that an attempt in this direction, though at first\r\nunsuccessful, has finally been worked into such a form as to remunerate\r\nthe manufacturer.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to-night to bring under your notice methods by which\r\nsaving can be effected in the cloth industry. I am aware that these\r\nmethods have not much claim to novelty; but I also know that there are,\r\nunfortunately, few works where they are practiced.\r\n\r\nThe first of these relates to the saving and utilization of the soap\r\nused in wool scouring and milling. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to\r\nexplain that woolen goods are scoured by being run between rollers,\r\nafter passing through a bath of soap, and this is continued for several\r\nhours, the cloth being repeatedly moistened with the lye, and repeatedly\r\nwrung out by the rollers. The process is analogous to ordinary washing;\r\nthe soap dissolves the greasy film adhering to the fibers, and the\r\n\"dirt\" mechanically retained is thus loosened, and washed away. Now, in\r\norder to dissolve this greasy matter, a considerable amount of soap must\r\nbe employed; and in the course of purification of the fabric, not merely\r\nwhat may be characterized as \"dirt\" is removed, but also short fibers,\r\nand various dye-stuffs with which the fabric has been dyed, many of\r\nwhich are partially soluble in alkaline water; moreover, it invariably\r\nhappens that some dye does not combine with the fiber and mordant, thus\r\nbecoming fixed, but merely incrusts the fiber; hence this portion is\r\nwashed off when the retaining film of grease is removed from the fiber.\r\nThe suds, therefore, after fulfilling this purpose, are no longer a pure\r\nsolution of soap, but contain many foreign matters; and the problem is\r\nso to treat these suds as to recover the fat in some condition available\r\nfor re-conversion into soap.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose wooden runnels are placed beneath the rollers, through\r\nwhich the cloth passes in the scouring machine, so as to collect the\r\nsuds after they have been spent. These runnels lead to a wooden pipe or\r\nrunnel, which receives the spent suds from all the scouring machines,\r\nand the whole of the waste, instead of being let off into the stream,\r\npolluting it, delivers into a tank or trough, which may also be\r\nconstructed of wood, but, as it has to withstand the action of acid, is\r\nbetter lined with lead. This tank is necessarily proportioned in size\r\nto the number of scouring machines and the quantity of spent suds to\r\nbe treated. When a sufficient quantity has collected, oil of vitriol,\r\ndiluted with twice its bulk of water, is added, one workman pouring it\r\nin gradually while another stirs the contents of the tank vigorously. At\r\nshort intervals, the liquid is tested by means of litmus paper, and\r\nwhen it shows a faint acid reaction, by turning the blue paper red, the\r\naddition of acid is stopped. The acid has then combined with the alkali\r\nof the soap, while the fatty acids formerly in combination with the\r\nalkali are liberated, and float to the surface of the liquid, carrying\r\nwith them the impurities in the shape of short fibers and dye stuffs;\r\nthe sand and heavier impurity, should any be present, sinks to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nAfter standing for some hours, the separation is complete. In order to\r\nseparate the two layers, the tank is provided with an exit in the side,\r\nnear the bottom, closed by a sluice or valve. This valve is opened, and\r\nthe watery portion is allowed to escape into a sand filter bed.\r\n\r\nThe filter serves to retain any solid impurities which may still remain\r\nsuspended in the water; but it will be found that the escaping water is\r\nnearly pure.\r\n\r\nThe dark brown fatty acid is mixed with a large amount of impurity, such\r\nas short wool fibers, burrs, sand, and dye stuffs washed from the wool.\r\nTo remove water more completely, the semi-fluid mass is pumped from the\r\ntank, and delivered into hair-cloth filters; the liquid which drains\r\nfrom these bags finds its ways to the sand filters joining the drainage\r\nwhich formerly passed out from the tank through the sluice. After being\r\nturned over in the filter several times, the residue is transferred to\r\ncanvas sacks. These sacks are placed in a filter press, where they are\r\nexposed to pressure while heated to a temperature sufficient to melt\r\nthe fat. The solid impurities remain in the bags, while the fatty acids\r\nescape, and are received in a barrel or tank for the purpose. The fatty\r\nacids, when cold, are of a deep brown color, and of the consistency\r\nof butter. The residue is kept, and the method of treating it for the\r\nrecovery of indigo will afterward be described.\r\n\r\nThe fatty acids are now ready for conversion into soap. It may here be\r\nremarked that, on distillation, they yield a nearly white fatty mass,\r\nwhich, when treated with soda-lye, is capable of yielding a perfectly\r\nwhite soap. But, for the clothworker's purpose, this purification is\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe conversion into soap is a very simple matter. As the fats are\r\nacids--a mixture of palmitic, oleic, and stearic acids--and not the\r\nglycerine salts of these acids, like ordinary fats, soap is made by\r\ncausing them directly to unite with caustic soda. The fats are melted\r\nin a copper, by means of a steam-jacket, or coil of steam-pipe in the\r\ncopper, and the soda-lye is run in until complete union has taken place.\r\nThe exact point of neutralization can easily be found by taking out\r\na small sample after stirring, and dissolving it in some methylated\r\nspirits. A few drops of alcoholic tincture of phenol-phthalein are then\r\nadded, and as soon as a faint red color appears, addition of soda is\r\nstopped. This shows that the fatty acids have been over-saturated.\r\nAddition of a little more fat renders them perfectly neutral, and the\r\nsoap is then ladled out into wooden moulds, lined with loose sheets of\r\nzinc.\r\n\r\nThe resulting soap is of a brown color, but is perfectly adapted for the\r\npurpose of wool-scouring. It should here be mentioned that, in practice,\r\nthe soap is always made somewhat alkaline; in point of fact, it contains\r\nabout 2 per cent. of free alkali. This is found to assist in scouring; I\r\npresume that the free alkali forms a soap with the oil added to the wool\r\nduring spinning, and if no free alkali be present, this oil would not be\r\nso thoroughly removed.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in this simple method of soap-making, there is\r\nno salting out to separate the true soap from the watery solution of\r\nglycerine, for no glycerine is present. The apparatus may be of the\r\nsimplest nature, and on any required scale, proportionate to the size of\r\nthe mill. It is a process which requires no specially skilled labor; in\r\nany works some hand may be told off to conduct the process as occasion\r\nrequires; and as a very large proportion of the fatty matter is\r\nrecovered, the soap-bill is reduced to a very small fraction of the\r\namount which would be paid were recovery not practiced. And lastly, the\r\nstreams are not polluted; the only waste is a little sulphate of soda,\r\nwhich can hardly be regarded as a nuisance, inasmuch as it is a not\r\nunfrequent constituent of many natural waters.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the solid matter from which the fatty acids have\r\nbeen removed by pressure. This brown, earthly-looking cake consists of\r\nvegetable impurity washed off from the cloth, of short fibers, and of\r\nvarious dye stuffs. It is divided into two lots: That which contains\r\nindigo, and that which contains none, or which contains too small a\r\nquantity for profitable extraction. And it may here be remarked, that it\r\nis advisable to collect the suds from cloth dyed with indigo separate\r\nfrom that to dye which no indigo has been employed. The residue from\r\nindigo-dyed cloth has always a more or less blue shade, and if much\r\nindigo is present, the well-known copper-color is evident. Of course,\r\nthe amount of indigo must greatly vary, but it may rise to 8 or 10 per\r\ncent. of the total weight of the refuse.\r\n\r\nTo recover the indigo from this refuse, the somewhat hard cakes are\r\nbroken up, placed in a tank, and allowed to steep in water. When quite\r\ndisintegrated, they are transferred to another tank--a barrel may be\r\nused for small quantities--and thus this refuse is exposed to the\r\nreducing action of copperas and lime. The indigo is converted into\r\nindigo-white, and is rendered soluble, and it oxidizes on the surface,\r\nforming a layer of blue froth on the top of the liquid, while the\r\nremainder of the impurities sinks. This process of reduction may last\r\nfor twenty-four hours, and is helped by frequent stirring.\r\n\r\nThe indigo scum is preserved, and placed in filter cloths, where it is\r\nthoroughly washed with water two or three times. The residue which has\r\nsunk to the bottom is removed, dried, and forms a valuable manure,\r\nowing to the amount of the nitrogen which it contains. Its value may be\r\nincreased by addition of weak vitriol, which exercises a decomposing\r\naction on the nitrogenous matter, forming with it sulphate of ammonia.\r\nThe original residue from the filter-press, if it does not contain\r\nindigo, may be at once put to similar use.\r\n\r\nIn large works, which dye their own goods, it is well known that the\r\n\"fermentation vat\" is in general use for indigo-dyeing. But this vat\r\nrequires constant superintendence, and must be kept in continual action;\r\nbesides, it is successful only on a comparatively large scale. And,\r\nmoreover, it requires skilled labor. Small works, or works in which\r\ndyeing is only occasionally practiced, find it more convenient to use\r\nSchützenberger and Lalande's process. Although this process is well\r\nknown, a short description of it may not here be out of place.\r\n\r\nThe process depends on the reduction of indigo to indigo-white, or\r\nsoluble indigo, by means of hyposulphite, or, as it is generally termed\r\nto avoid confusion with antichlore, rightly named thiosulphate of soda,\r\nhydrosulphite of soda. The formula of this substance is NaHSO_{2}, as\r\ndistinguished from what is commonly known as hyposulphite of soda,\r\nNa_{2}S_{2}O_{3}. It is produced by the action of zinc-dust on the acid\r\nsulphite of soda. The zinc may be supposed to remove oxygen from the\r\nacid sulphite, NaHSO_{3}, giving hyposulphite, NaHS0_{2}. The reduction\r\nof the acid sulphite is best performed in a cask, which can be closed at\r\nthe top, so as to avoid entrance of air. The acid sulphite of soda, at a\r\nstrength of 50 or 60 Twaddell (specific gravity 1.26 to 1.3), is placed\r\nin the cask, and zinc-dust is added, with frequent stirring. The liquid\r\nis then mixed with milk of lime, and after again thoroughly stirring,\r\nthe liquid is allowed to settle, and the clear is decanted into the\r\ndyeing-copper. The indigo, in the frothy state in which it is skimmed\r\nfrom the purifying barrels or tanks, is then added, with sufficient lime\r\nto dissolve it when it has been reduced. It is heated gently by a steam\r\ncoil, to about 90° Fahr., and the goods are dyed in it. The colors\r\nobtained by means of this indigo are light in shade, and the goods must\r\nbe dipped several times if dark shades are required. But it is found\r\nbetter in practice not to attempt to dye dark shades by this process;\r\nthe ordinary indigo-vat is better adapted for such work. The object of\r\nnot wasting indigo is sufficiently attained by employing it for the\r\npurpose to which it is best adapted. Of course the recovered indigo may\r\nbe used in the ordinary manner. I merely mention the most convenient way\r\nof disposing of it in works where only a small quantity is recovered,\r\nand which do not practice dyeing on an extensive scale.\r\n\r\nI have now to ask you to turn to a different subject, namely, the\r\nscouring of wool, not by the usual agent, water, but by a liquid,\r\nbisulphide of carbon, made by the action of sulphur vapor on red hot\r\ncoke or charcoal.\r\n\r\nThis, again, is not wholly a new process, for various attempts have\r\nbeen made to dissolve out the yolk, or _suint_, or greasy matter from\r\nunwashed wool, as it comes from the back of the sheep. Fusel oil\r\nhas been patented for this purpose. Carbon disulphide has also been\r\npatented, but, as will afterward be shown, the old method of removing it\r\nfrom the wool injured the color and quality of the fiber, so as to make\r\nthe application of this scouring agent a failure.\r\n\r\nWool in its unwashed state contains a considerable proportion of what is\r\ntermed _suint_. This consists of the fatty matter exuded as perspiration\r\nfrom the sheep, along with, or in some form of combination with, potash\r\nderived from the grass on which the sheep feed. _Suint_ was first\r\ninvestigated by Vauquelin. He obtained it by evaporating, after\r\nfiltration, the water in which raw fleeces had been washed. The residue\r\nis of a brown color, and has a saline, bitter taste. On addition of an\r\nacid to its solution in water, it coagulates, and a fatty matter rises\r\nto the surface. It is, in fact, a potash soap, to a great extent\r\ncontaining carbonate and acetate of potash, along with chloride of\r\npotassium and lime, probably in combination also with fatty acids. It is\r\nusually mixed with sand and carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, M. Chevreul, who is still alive in Paris, although nearly a\r\ncentury old, published an analysis of merino wool. It consisted of:\r\n\r\n                                 Per cent.\r\n  Pure wool                        31.23\r\n  Soluble _suint_                  32.74\r\n  Insoluble                         8.57\r\n  Earthy matter                    27.46\r\n                                  ------\r\n                                  100.00\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen that _suint_ forms a very important constituent of raw\r\nwool. Its proportion varies, of course, according to the nature of the\r\npasture on which the sheep are fed, the climate, etc. Wool from Buenos\r\nAyres, for example, contains much less than that analyzed by M.\r\nChevreul; its amount is only 12 per cent. of the weight of the raw wool.\r\n\r\nThis _suint_ contains always about 52 per cent. of residue when ignited.\r\nThe composition of this residue is:\r\n\r\n                                 Per cent.\r\n  Carbonate of potash              86.78\r\n  Chloride of potassium             6.18\r\n  Sulphate of potash                2.83\r\n  Silica, alumina, etc.             4.21\r\n                                  ------\r\n                                  100.00\r\n\r\nIn 1859, MM. Maumene and Rogelet patented the use of the water in\r\nwhich wool has been washed as a source of potash, and at present the\r\nextraction of potash from _suint_ is practiced in France on a large\r\nscale. The wool is washed in a systematic manner, in casks, with cold\r\nwater, which runs out of the last cask with specific gravity 1.1. These\r\nwashings are evaporated to dryness, and the residue is calcined in iron\r\nretorts, the gas evolved being used for illuminating purposes. The\r\nremaining cinder, consisting of a mixture of charcoal and carbonate of\r\npotash, is treated with water, whereby the latter is dissolved out.\r\nThe residue left on evaporation of this water consists largely--almost\r\nentirely--of white carbonate of potash. At present there are works at\r\nRheims, Elboeuf, Fourmier, and Vervier, which yield about 1,000 tons of\r\ncarbonate of potash annually. Now, only 15,000 tons are made per annum\r\nby Leblanc's process. In 1868, 62,000 tons of wool were imported into\r\nBritain from Australia alone, and from this 7,000 to 8,000 tons of\r\ncarbonate of potash might have been recovered, the value of which is\r\n£260,000. Yet it was all wasted! And this estimate does not include the\r\nfats of the _suint_, which are worth an even greater sum.\r\n\r\nNow, it is evident that there is here a profitable source of economy. So\r\nfar as I am aware, no work in this country saves its washings. The water\r\nall goes to pollute the nearest river.\r\n\r\nThe use of carbon disulphide has again been introduced, and it is to be\r\nhoped with better success, for methods have been devised whereby the\r\nwool is not injured by it, but is even rendered better than when scoured\r\nby the old process of washing with carbonate of soda and water, or by\r\nsoap. The process is due to Mr. Thomas J. Mullings. Briefly described,\r\nit consists in exposing the wool, placed in a hydro-extractor, to the\r\naction of bisulphide of carbon; the machine is then made to revolve, and\r\nthe excess of solvent is expelled, carrying with it the fatty matters;\r\nthe solvent finds its way into a tank, from which it flows into a still,\r\nheated with steam; the carbon disulphide, which boils at a very low\r\ntemperature, distills over, and is again ready for use, while the\r\nresidue in the still consists of _suint_ washed from the wool. To\r\nremove the last trace of carbon disulphide from the wool in the\r\nhydro-extractor, cold water is admitted, and when the wool is soaked,\r\nthe machine again revolves. On expulsion of the water, the wool is ready\r\nfor washing in the ordinary machines, but with cold water only instead\r\nof hot soapsuds.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing features of Mr. Mullings' process are, method by\r\nwhich loss of carbon disulphide is avoided, and the extraction of\r\nthat solvent by means of cold water. The apparatus consists of a\r\nhydro-extractor or centrifugal machine of special construction, fitted\r\nwith a bell-shaped cover, which can be lifted into and out of position\r\nby means of a weighted lever. The rim of this cover fits into an annular\r\ncup filled with water, which surrounds the top of the machine, forming\r\nan effective seal or joint. Upon the spindle of this machine is\r\nsuspended, as in ordinary forms of the hydro-extractor, a perforated\r\nbasket, and in this basket is placed the wool to be treated. The cover\r\nbeing closed, the carbon disulphide is admitted, and passing through the\r\nwool, the greasy matter is dissolved, and along with the solvent enters\r\na reservoir. The machine is now set in motion, and the bulk of the\r\nsolvent is drawn off. Cold water is then admitted, and the machine being\r\nagain caused to rotate, the whole of the bisulphide is expelled. It is\r\na curious fact that, although wool soaks remarkably easily with carbon\r\ndisulphide, and at once becomes wet, cold water expels and replaces\r\nalmost all that liquid. This operation takes about twenty minutes, and\r\nat one operation about 1½ cwt. of raw wool may be treated. The wool is\r\nthen washed in suitable washing machines of the ordinary type, but with\r\ncold water, no soap or alkali being employed. The bisulphide of carbon,\r\nmixed with water, flows into a reservoir, provided with diaphragms to\r\nprevent splashing, and consequent loss by evaporation. From its gravity\r\nit sinks, forming a layer below the water; it is then separated and\r\nrecovered by distillation, and may be used in subsequent operations.\r\n\r\nThe point in which this process differs from the old and unsuccessful\r\nones formerly tried, is in the expulsion of the carbon disulphide. It\r\nwas imagined that it was necessary to expel it by means of heat or\r\nsteam. Now, when wool moist with bisulphide is heated, it invariably\r\nturns yellow. No heat must, therefore, be employed. As already remarked,\r\nthe solvent is expelled with cold water.\r\n\r\nThe residue, after distillation of the carbon disulphide, is a grayish\r\ncolored, very viscous oily matter, still retaining a little bisulphide,\r\nas may be perceived from the smell. It has not the composition of\r\nordinary _suint_, inasmuch as it contains no carbonate of potash, and\r\nindeed little mineral matter of any kind. A sample which I analyzed\r\nlost in drying 36.2 per cent., the loss consisting of water and carbon\r\ndisulphide. It gave a residue on ignition amounting only to 1.6 per\r\ncent. of the original fatty matter, or 2.5 per cent. of the dried fat.\r\nThe oil appears, from some experiments which I made, to be a mixture of\r\na glycerine salt and a cholesterine salt of fatty acids. It distills\r\nwithout much decomposition, giving a brown-yellow oil, which fluoresces\r\nstrongly, and has a somewhat pungent smell. The molecular weight was\r\ndetermined by saponification with alcoholic potash, and subsequent\r\ntitration of the excess of potash employed. This was found to equal\r\n546.3. This would correspond to a mixture of 18.7 parts of stearate,\r\npalmitate, and oleate of glycerine, with 81.3 parts of the same acids\r\ncombined with cholesteryl. But this is largely conjecture. The\r\nboiling point of the oil is high, much above the range of a mercurial\r\nthermometer, so that it is difficult to gain an insight into its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nAn objection which has been raised to this process is that the use of\r\nsuch an easily inflammable substance as bisulphide of carbon is attended\r\nby great risk of fire. Were the bisulphide to be exposed to free air,\r\nthere might be force in this objection; but there is no reason why it\r\nshould ever be removed from under a layer of water. The apparatus, to\r\nmake all safe, should not be under the same roof as the mill; and no\r\nopen fire need be used in the building set apart for it. It is easy to\r\nrotate the centrifugal machine by a belt from the mill, but better by a\r\nsmall engine attached, the power for which can be conducted by a small\r\nsteam-pipe, and the distillation of the bisulphide can also be conducted\r\nwithout danger by the use of steam, as its boiling point is a very low\r\none. The question may be naturally asked, \"How do the wool and fabric\r\nmade from the wool scoured by this process, compare with that scoured in\r\nthe usual way?\" To answer this question I may refer to a test made by\r\nMessrs. Isaac Holden & Co., at their works at Roubaix. A sample of wool\r\nwas divided into two portions, one of which was scoured by the usual\r\nmethod, and the other by the turbine or Mullings' process. Skilled\r\nworkers then span each sample to as fine a thread as possible. Now\r\nthe thinness to which a wool can be spun is evidence of its power of\r\ncohesion--in other words, its strength. The weight of 1,000 meters of\r\nthe wool cleaned by the new process bore to that scoured by the old\r\nprocess the proportion of 1,015 to 1,085, showing that a considerably\r\nfiner thread had been produced. And in total quantity, 67.53 kilos.\r\nof the former corresponded to 71.77 kilos. of the latter, showing\r\na proportionately less waste. Such fine yarn had never before been\r\nobtained from similar wool. The yarn of the soap-washed wool could not\r\nbe spun, for it could not withstand the strain; whereas, that scoured by\r\nthe new process gave an admirable thread.\r\n\r\nAnother test to which it was subjected may be cited. It is the custom in\r\nFrance, before the wool is scoured, to put it through a sorting process,\r\nby which all the short lengths are weeded out. On a quantity exceeding\r\n11,000 kilogrammes, half of which was scoured by the turbine process,\r\nand half by the ordinary process, the former in scouring lost in weight\r\n2 per cent. less than the latter, although the short length extracted\r\nfrom the moiety thus treated weighed only 10 kilogrammes, while that\r\ntaken from the other weighed over 150 kilogrammes. This saving, even\r\nwith the unequal treatment, amounted in value to from 30 to 40 centimes\r\nper kilogramme.\r\n\r\nIn order that the importance of this application may be realized, I\r\nshall conclude with some figures:\r\n\r\nThe raw wool imported into England, in the year 1882, amounted to\r\n1,487,169 bales, its total value being about £22,000,000. The cost of\r\nwashing this wool by the old process, with carbonate of soda, amounts to\r\nabout ½d. per lb. of the raw material. The cost for the total quantity\r\nof wool imported is at least £1,214,000. But it is customary to wash\r\nwool with soap, especially for the combing trade, and the cost is then\r\nabout 1d. per lb. The cost of scouring by the new process is about £1\r\n5s. per ton, or 0.13d. per lb. Taking the least favorable comparison,\r\nwere all the imported wool (home-grown wool is here left out of the\r\ncalculation, for want of sufficient returns) cleansed by the turbine\r\nprocess, the actual saving would be £1,214,500 _minus_ £315,700, or\r\nnearly £900,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that there is room for a very important economy in\r\nthe treatment of wool. I have endeavored to show how economy may be\r\npracticed in scouring by the old process with soap, and how one dye\r\nstuff may be profitably recovered. It is to be hoped that means of\r\nextracting other dyes from the residue may soon follow. Unless the\r\nprocess were too costly to repay the trouble of extraction, it would\r\nbe well worth practicing; for it would not merely be a solution of the\r\nproblem of how to avoid waste, but would at the same time prevent the\r\npollution of our streams, now, unfortunately, only too rarely pellucid;\r\nand were the last process to have as successful a future as I hope it\r\nmay have, a very important saving of expense would result, and a large\r\nquantity of valuable fatty matter would no longer be thrown away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGGESTIONS IN DECORATIVE ART.--DESIGNS FOR IRON GATES.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL AND ITS USES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a paper lately read before the Association of Foremen\r\nEngineers.]\r\n\r\nBy JAMES PYKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe records from which geologists draw their information can scarcely be\r\ncompared to written or printed histories. There are, however, nations\r\nof whom no written account exists, who perhaps never had any written\r\nhistory, but about whom we are still able to gather from other sources\r\na vast amount of information. Their houses, their monuments, their\r\nweapons, and their tools have survived, and these tell us the kind of\r\nlife, the state of civilization, and the skill of the men to whom they\r\nbelonged; from the contents of their tombs we learn what manner of men\r\nthey were physically; sometimes a sudden change in the appointments and\r\nbelongings of the folk indicates that tribes which had for a long time\r\ninhabited a district were driven out and replaced by a new race. Thus,\r\nthen, from waifs and strays we can piece together a fairly connected\r\naccount of the events of a period long antecedent to any written\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Dr. Schliemann on the supposed site of the city of\r\nTroy furnish a good example of this method of research. He found lying,\r\none on the top of another, traces of the existence of five successive\r\ncommunities of men, differing in customs and social development, and was\r\nable to establish the fact that some of the cities had been destroyed by\r\nfire, and that later on other towns had grown up over the buried remains\r\nof the earlier settlements. The lowest layers were, of course, the\r\noldest, and the position of each layer in the pile gives its date, not\r\nin years, but with regard to the layers above and below it.\r\n\r\nNow, from time immemorial nature has been at work building up monuments\r\nand providing tombs which tell us what were the events going on,\r\nand what kind of inhabitants the earth had long before man made his\r\nappearance on its surface. The monuments are the rocks which compose the\r\nground under our feet, and these, like many ancient monuments of human\r\nconstruction, are the tombs of the creatures that lived while they were\r\nbeing built.\r\n\r\nMany facts testify that the earth's crust did not come into existence\r\nexactly as we find it now, but that its rocks have been built up by the\r\nslow action of natural agencies. These rocks constantly inclose the\r\nremains of plants and animals, and as it is evident that neither plant\r\nnor animal could have lived in the heart of a solid rock, this fact\r\nshows that the rock must in some way have gathered round the remains\r\nthat are now found in it. Again, many of these remains, or fossils,\r\nbelonged to animals that lived in water, the larger part, indeed, to\r\nmarine creatures. This indicates that the rock was formed beneath the\r\nsea, and when we examine the way in which the constituents of the rock\r\nare arranged, we frequently find it to correspond exactly with the\r\nmanner in which the sand and mud that rivers sweep down into the sea or\r\nlakes are spread out over the bottom of the water. In a pile of rocks\r\nformed in this way it is clear that the lowest is the oldest of all, and\r\nthat any one stratum lying above is younger than the one beneath it.\r\nFurther, the occurrence of rocks inland containing marine fossils far\r\nabove the sea level shows that the sea and land have changed places.\r\nWhen, again, we find that the fossils of one group of rocks differ\r\nentirely from those of a group lying above them, we learn that one race\r\nof creatures died out and was supplanted by a new assemblage of animal\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThese general remarks will, I trust, give some notion of the evidence\r\nwhich is available for reconstructing the history of those remote\r\nperiods with which geology deals, and of the kind of reasoning which the\r\ngeologist employs for interpreting the records that are submitted to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWe will now briefly examine, by aid of these methods, the group of rocks\r\nin which coal occurs in Great Britain, and see how far we can read the\r\nstory they have to tell.\r\n\r\nThe group with which we have to deal is called the carboniferous or\r\ncoal bearing system, and it includes four classes of rocks, viz.: 1,\r\nsandstone; 2, shale or bind; 3, limestone; 4, coal and underclay.\r\n\r\nWe will take the sandstones and shales first. They are grains of sand\r\nknown to mineralogists as quartz, and consisting of a substance called\r\nsilica by chemists. The grains of sand are bound together by a cement\r\nwhich in some few cases is identical in composition with themselves, and\r\nconsists of pure silica, but usually is a mixture of sandy, clayey, and\r\nother substances. The shales are made up very largely of clay, mixed,\r\nhowever, usually with sand and other substances, forming a conglomerate.\r\nBoth sandstones and shales are divided into layers or beds, and are said\r\nto be stratified. It is this stratified or bedded structure that gives\r\nus the first clew to the way in which these rocks were formed. Rivers\r\nare constantly carrying down sand and mud into the sea or lakes, and\r\nwhen their flow is slackened on entering the still water the materials\r\nthey bring down with them sink and are spread out in layers over the\r\nbottom. The structure of the sandstones and shales shows that they were\r\nformed in this way; they often inclose the remains of plants that have\r\nbeen carried down from land, and occasionally of animals that lived in\r\nthe water where they were deposited.\r\n\r\nThe next we have to consider is limestone, which is mainly made up of a\r\nsubstance known to chemists as calcium carbonate, or carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nIn some districts, especially in volcanic countries, springs occur very\r\nhighly charged with carbonate of lime. The warm springs of Matlock are\r\na case in point; they are probably the last vestige of volcanic action\r\nwhich was in operation in that neighborhood during carboniferous times.\r\nLimestone is chiefly formed by the agency of small marine creatures of\r\nlow organization. By the aid of these animals the carbonate of lime is\r\nbrought back to a solid form; at their death their hard parts fall to\r\nthe bottom and accumulate in a mass of pure limestone, which afterward\r\nbecomes solidified into limestone rock.\r\n\r\nThe information that limestone gives us is this:\r\n\r\nWhen we find, as is often the case, a mass of limestone hundreds of feet\r\nthick, and composed of little else but carbonate of lime, we know that\r\nthe spot where it occurs was, at the time it was formed, far out at sea,\r\ncovered by the clear water of mid ocean; and when we find that this\r\nlimestone grows in certain directions earthy and impure, and that layers\r\nof shale and sandstone, thin at first, but gradually thickening out in\r\na wedge-shape form, come in between its beds, we know that in those\r\ndirections we are traveling toward the shore lines of that sea whence\r\nthe water was receiving from time to time supplies of muddy and sandy\r\nsediment.\r\n\r\nThe next class of rocks are the clays that are found beneath every\r\nbed of coal, and which are known as _underclays_, or _warrant_, or\r\n_spavins_. They vary very much in mineral composition. Sometimes they\r\nare soft clay; sometimes clay mixed with a certain portion of sand; and\r\nsometimes they contain such a large proportion of silicious matters that\r\nthey become hard, flinty rock, which many of you know under the name\r\nof _gannister_. But all underclays agree in two points: they are all\r\nunstratified. They differ totally from the shales and sandstones in this\r\nrespect, and instead of splitting up readily into thin flakes, they\r\nbreak up into irregular lumpy masses. And they all contain a very\r\npeculiar vegetable fossil called _Stigmaria_.\r\n\r\nThis strange fossil was for a long time a sore puzzle to fossil\r\nbotanists, and after much discussion the question was fairly solved by\r\nMr. Binney by the discovery of a tree embedded in the coal measures,\r\nand standing erect just as it grew, with its roots spread out into the\r\nstratum on which it stood. These roots were Stigmaria, and the stuff\r\ninto which they penetrated was an underclay. Sir Charles Lyell mentions\r\nan individual sigillaria 72 feet in length found at Newcastle, and a\r\nspecimen taken from the Jarrow coal mine was more than 40 feet in length\r\nand 13 feet in diameter near the base. It is not often these trees are\r\nfound erect, because the action of water, combined with natural decay,\r\nhas generally thrown them down. They are, however, found in very large\r\nnumbers in the roof of the coal, evidently having been tossed over, and\r\nlying there flat and squeezed thin by the pressure of the measures that\r\nlie above them.\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to coal itself--a rock which constitutes a small portion\r\nof the whole bulk of the carboniferous deposits, but which may be fairly\r\nlooked upon as the most important member of that group, both on account\r\nof its intrinsic value and also from the interest that attaches to its\r\nhistory. That coal is little else but mineralized vegetable matter is a\r\npoint on which there has for a long time been but small doubt. The\r\nmore minute investigations of recent years have not only placed this\r\ncompletely beyond question, but have also enabled us to say what the\r\nplants were which contributed to the formation of coal, and in some\r\ncases even to decide what portions of those plants enter into its\r\ncomposition. It is a thing so universally admitted on all hands, that I\r\nshall take it for granted you are all perfectly convinced that coal has\r\nbeen nothing in the world but a great mass of vegetable matter. The only\r\nquestion is: How were these great masses of vegetable matter brought\r\ntogether? And you must realize that they were very large masses indeed.\r\nJust to take one instance. The Yorkshire and Derbyshire coal field is\r\nsomewhere about 700 to 800 square miles in area, and Lancashire about\r\n200. Well, in both these coal fields you have a great number of beds of\r\ncoal that spread over the whole of them with tolerable regularity and\r\nthickness, and very often with scarcely any break whatever. And this is\r\nonly a very small portion of what must have been the original sheet of\r\ncoal, so that you see we have to account for a mass of vegetable matter\r\nperfectly free from any admixture of sand, mud, or dirt, and laid down\r\nwith tolerably uniform thickness over many hundreds of square miles.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was supposed that coal was formed out of dead trees and\r\nplants which were swept down by rivers into the sea, just in the same\r\nway as shales and sandstones were formed out of mud and sand so swept\r\ndown. The fatal objection to this theory, however, is that rivers would\r\nnot bring down dead wood alone, but they would bring down sand and mud,\r\nand other matters, and that in the bottom of the sea the dead wood would\r\nbe mixed with these matters, and instead of getting a perfectly unmixed\r\nmass of vegetable matter, we should get a mixture of dead plants, sand,\r\nmud, and other things, which would give rise to something like coal, but\r\nsomething very different, as any one who tries to burn such coal will\r\nsoon find out, from really good, pure house coal. So that this theory,\r\nwhich is generally known as the \"drift\" theory, was totally inadequate\r\nto account for the facts as we know them.\r\n\r\nThe other theory was that coal was formed out of plants and trees that\r\ngrew on the spot where we now find coal itself. On this supposition it\r\nis easy to account for the absence of foreign admixtures of sand, mud,\r\nand clay in the coal; and we can also understand very much better than\r\nby the aid of the drift theory how the coal had accumulated with such\r\nwonderful uniformity of thickness over such very large areas. This\r\ntheory was for some time but poorly received; but after the discovery\r\nof Sir William Logan, that every bed of coal had a bed of underclay\r\nbeneath, and the discovery of Mr. Binney, that these underclays were\r\ntrue soils on which plants had undoubtedly grown, there was no doubt\r\nwhatever that this was the real and true explanation of the matter.\r\n\r\nI dare say many of you have had occasion to walk across peat bogs.\r\nThe peat bog is a great mass of vegetable matter, which is every year\r\ngrowing thicker and thicker; and underneath it there is almost always a\r\nbed of thin clay, in look very much like the underclays, and this thin\r\nclay is penetrated by the rootlets of the moss forming the peat, exactly\r\nthe same way as the underclays of the coal measures are penetrated by\r\nthe stigmaria and its rootlets. But you must not suppose that the plants\r\nout of which coal was formed were exactly the same low type of moss\r\nwhich forms our present peat bogs. However, it is pretty certain that\r\nthey were for the most part of a loose, succulent texture, and that they\r\ngrew very rapidly indeed.\r\n\r\nYou will have noticed that there is one step more wanted to make good\r\nthis theory of the growth of coal on the spot where we now find it.\r\nThe coal is found, as already described, interbedded with shales and\r\nsandstones. These shales and sandstones, as shown, were formed beneath\r\nthe water of the sea, and as long as they remained there of course no\r\nplants could grow upon them. The question is, How was the land surface\r\nformed for the growth of plants? It must have been formed in some way or\r\nother by the sea bottom having been raised above the level of the water.\r\nNow, we have distinct proof in many cases that elevation of the sea\r\nbottom and depression of the land is now going on in many parts of the\r\nearth's surface. And, therefore, we shall be assuming nothing beyond the\r\nrange of experience if we say that such elevations and depressions went\r\non during coal measure times. The coal measure times must have been\r\ntimes during which the same spot was now below the sea, and now dry\r\nland, over and over again. There was a land surface on which plants grew\r\nfast and multiplied rapidly, and as they died fell and accumulated in\r\na great heap of dead vegetable matter. After a time this layer of\r\nvegetable matter was slowly and gently let down beneath the waters of\r\nthe sea--so slowly that the water flowing over it did not, as a rule,\r\ndisturb the loose, pasty mass; and then, by the method I have described\r\nto you, shales and sandstones were deposited on the top of this mass\r\nof dead vegetable matter. By their weight they compressed it, and\r\nby certain chemical changes (which we have not time to go into this\r\nevening) this dense mass of vegetable matter became converted into coal.\r\nAfter a time the shales and sandstones which had been piled above this\r\nstuff, which was to form coal for the future, were again elevated to\r\nform a land surface; upon this another forest sprang up, and by its\r\ndecay produced another mass of vegetable matter fit to form coal. This\r\nagain was let down below the water, more shales and sandstones were\r\ndeposited on the top, and this process went on over and over again till\r\nthe whole mass of our present coal measures was formed. You will now see\r\nhow it is that trees are so seldom found in an upright position in the\r\ncoal beds. As the land went down, they would in very many cases be\r\ntoppled over by the water as it flowed against them, or their base would\r\nbe rotted, and they would then either fall or be blown over; that is the\r\nreason why in most cases they are found lying flat on the roof of the\r\ncoal bed. But in a few cases, when the depression was very gentle and\r\ngradual, the trees were not overthrown, and the shales and sandstones\r\naccumulated round them and preserved them in the position in which they\r\ngrew.\r\n\r\nI do not know that I can point out to you anything nowadays that exactly\r\nresembles the state of things that must have gone on during the times\r\nthese coal measures were being formed; but there are a great many cases\r\nstrikingly analogous to them. I shall not attempt to describe them to\r\nyou, but may just mention the mangrove swamps that very often fringe the\r\ncoasts in the tropics, and the cypress swamps of the Mississippi, which\r\nare so well described by Sir Charles Lyell in his recent works; also\r\nthe great Dismal Swamp of Virginia, which appears to me to furnish the\r\nnearest analogue to the state of things that existed during coal measure\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nHaving explained the way in which coal measures have been formed, we\r\nwill now take a brief sketch of its uses and products. The year 1259 is\r\nmemorable in the annals of coal mining. Hitherto the mineral had not\r\nbeen raised by authority, but in that year Henry III. granted a charter\r\nto the freemen of Newcastle-on-Tyne for liberty to dig coal, and a\r\nconsiderable export trade was established with London, and it speedily\r\nbecame an article among the various manufacturers of the metropolis. But\r\nits popularity was but short lived. An impression became general\r\nthat the smoke arising therefrom contaminated the atmosphere and was\r\ninjurious to public health. Years of experience have proved the fallacy\r\nof the imputation; but in 1306 the outcry became so general that a\r\nproclamation was issued by Edward I forbidding the use of the offending\r\nfuel, and authorizing the destruction of all furnaces, etc., of those\r\npersons who should persist in using it. Prejudice gradually gave way as\r\nthe value of the fossil fuel became better known, and from that time\r\ndownward its use has become more and more extended down to the enormous\r\nextent of our present trade. The annual increase in the production of\r\ncoal in the British Isles since the year 1854 is over 2½ million tons.\r\nIn that year the coal produce was about 65 million tons, and it has\r\ngrown up to the year 1880 to the grand total of 135 million tons.\r\n\r\nWe will now deal with some of the uses that this valuable black diamond\r\nis now being put to. It is, in the first place, the center of all our\r\nenterprise and prosperity, and upon it depends our chief success as a\r\nmanufacturing nation for the future. When it is exhausted we shall have\r\nto look forward to the condition of things which now obtains in those\r\nregions where there is no coal--that is to say, instead of our being a\r\nnation full of manufacturing and mercantile enterprise, a great nation\r\nto which all the people of the earth resort, we shall be merely a people\r\nwho live for ourselves by the cultivation of the ground. The duration of\r\nour coal fields has been ascertained within certain limits. Mr. Hall, an\r\naccomplished geologist, tells us that in England at the present time we\r\nhave a stock of coal sufficient for our consumption for no less than\r\n1,000 years. On the other hand, Professor Jevons, whose opinion is\r\nworthy of the very greatest weight on such questions, calculates that\r\n100 years is about the tenure of our coal fields, according to the\r\npresent rate of increase in the consumption. Whichever view we take,\r\nsooner or later the end must ultimately come when the coal will be\r\nexhausted; when the great mainspring of our commercial enterprise will\r\nbe gone, and we shall revert to that condition in which we were before\r\nthe coal fields were worked. In this point of view, therefore, coal has\r\nan especial interest to us as engineers. If coal is important in this\r\ndirection, it is no less important in a purely scientific point of view,\r\napart from any mercantile end.\r\n\r\nThe chemist or physicist will tell you the wondrous story that the black\r\nsubstance which you burn is simply so much light and heat and motion\r\nborrowed from the sun and invested in the tissues of plants. He will\r\ntell you that when you sit round your firesides the flame which enlivens\r\nyou, and the gas which enables you to read, and which civilizes you, is\r\nnothing in the world but so much sunlight and so much sunheat bottled up\r\nin the tissues of vegetables, and simply reproduced in your grates and\r\ngas burners. Very few persons, I am afraid, realize this, which is one\r\nof the many stories which science in its higher teachings shows us--one\r\nof those fairy tales which are the result of the most careful scientific\r\ninvestigation. Of the hundred and odd million tons of coal which we in\r\nthis country burn in the course of a year, about 20,000,000 tons are\r\nthrown on our house fires; 30,000,000 tons find their way into our blast\r\nfurnaces, or are otherwise used in the smelting and manufacture of\r\nmetals; about 48,000,000 are burnt under steam boilers; 6,000,000 are\r\nused in gas-making; while the remainder is consumed in potteries, glass\r\nworks, brick and lime kilns, chemical works, and other sundries which I\r\nneed not speak of.\r\n\r\nTo go into the chemistry of coal is quite sufficient to take up more\r\ntime than I have at my disposal this evening, therefore I will briefly\r\ntouch on a few of the main points. Coal gas is made, as you are all\r\naware, by heating coal or cannel, which is the special form of coal\r\nmost valued for the purpose, on account of the high quality of gas it\r\nproduces in cylindrical fireclay retorts.\r\n\r\nThe by-products obtained in the manufacture of coal gas, the tar and the\r\nammonia water, are nowadays scarcely less important than the coal gas\r\nitself. The ammonia water furnishes large quantities of salts to be\r\nused, among other applications, as food for plants. We thus restore\r\nto-day to our vegetation the nitrogen which existed in plants of\r\nprimeval times. The tar, black and noisome though it be, is a marvelous\r\nproduct, by the reason of scores of beautiful substances which are\r\nconcealed within it.\r\n\r\nCoal tar when distilled yields three main products: naphtha, dead oil,\r\nand pitch or asphalt. The naphtha on redistillation yields benzine, from\r\nwhich are prepared some of our most beautiful dyes; the dead oil, as\r\nthe less volatile portion is termed, furnishes carbolic acid, used as a\r\ndisinfectant and antiseptic, together with anthracene and naphthaline;\r\nall three substances the starting points of new series of coloring\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThis discovery of these coloring matters marks an era in the history\r\nof chemical science; it exercised an extraordinary influence on the\r\ndevelopment of organic chemistry. Theoretical and applied chemistry were\r\nknit together in closer union than ever, and dye followed dye in quick\r\nsuccession; after mauve came magenta, and in close attendance followed a\r\nbrilliant train of reds, yellows, oranges, greens, blues, and violets;\r\nin fact, all the simple and beautiful colors of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nBut there is still another story of coal tar to be told. Among the\r\nmany curious substances that wonderful fluid contains is the beautiful\r\nwax-like body called paraffine, the development of which chiefly owes\r\nits origin to the genius and energy of Mr. James Young. As early as\r\n1848, Mr. Young had worked a small petroleum spring in a coal mine in\r\nDerbyshire, and had produced oils suitable for burning and lubricating\r\npurposes, but the spring gave out, and then Mr. Young sought to obtain\r\nthese oils by distilling coal. After many trials, in conjunction with\r\nother gentlemen connected therewith, he proved successful, and the\r\npresent magnitude of this industry is without parallel in the history of\r\nBritish manufactures.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland alone there are about sixty paraffine oil works, one alone\r\noccupying a site of nearly forty acres. Here about 120,000 gallons of\r\ncrude oil are produced weekly, and among the various works in Scotland\r\nabout 800,000 tons of shale are distilled per annum, producing nearly\r\n30,000,000 gallons of crude oil, from which about 12,000,000 gallons of\r\nrefined burning oil are obtained in addition to the large quantities\r\nof naphtha, solid paraffine, ammonia, and other chemical products.\r\nTwenty-five years ago scarcely a dozen persons had seen this paraffine,\r\nand now it is turned out by the ton, fashioned into candles delicately\r\ntinted with colors obtained from coal tar.\r\n\r\nI might dwell on this subject until it becomes wearisome to you,\r\ntherefore I will not trespass too much on your time. But from every\r\npoint we look we reach this fact, that our coal trade is one which\r\ndevelops itself according to laws that we are perfectly powerless to\r\ncontrol; if it seems to promise a less rapid increase here, it is only\r\nthat it may spread abroad with accelerated vigor elsewhere; if it is our\r\nslave in some aspects, it seems as if it were our master in others.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have to ask, What of our export coals? Rapid as has been the\r\ngrowth of our total production during the last twenty-three years, the\r\ngrowth of our export of coals has been greater still. Beginning at\r\n4,300,000 tons in '54, we find it reaching 16,250,000 tons in '76, and\r\nan increase at a corresponding ratio up to the present date as far as\r\nstatistics will carry us. At such a rate of increase it would seem as\r\nif our whole annual production would be ultimately swallowed up in our\r\nexports, and it is not, perhaps, impossible that after we have ceased to\r\nbe to any great extent a manufacturing people, a certain export trade\r\nin coal may still continue. Just the same as the export trade in coal\r\npreceded by centuries our own uses for it other than domestic, so may\r\nit also survive these by a period as prolonged. If our descent from\r\nour present favored position be a gradual one, much may be done in the\r\ninterval to adapt ourselves to the future outcome, but it is certain\r\nthat nothing will be done except under the stern persuasion of\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nWhen our coal fields become exhausted, be it soon or late, he would be\r\na wise or, perhaps, a rash speculator who fixed himself to a year or a\r\ngeneration. Being inevitable, the best philosophy is to make our decline\r\nmore gradual and less bitter. Sentimental regrets that these hills and\r\nvalleys will no longer resound with the din of labor, or be blackened by\r\nthe smoke of the factory, would surely be out of place. What we might\r\nregret is that Britain, which we know and are proud of, the Britain\r\nof great achievements in politics and literature, of free thought and\r\nself-respecting obedience, of a thousand years of high endeavor and\r\nconstant progress, was indeed to perish when these factories and\r\nfurnaces whirled and blazed their last. But, it is not so. This\r\ncountry's fortunes are gradually being merged into those of a Greater\r\nBritain, which largely, through the aid of coal, whose prospective\r\nloss we are lamenting, has grown beyond the limits of these islands to\r\noverspread the vastest and richest regions of the earth; and we have no\r\nreason to fear that the great inheritance that America and Australia\r\nand New Zealand have accepted from us will in their hands be dealt\r\nunworthily with in the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTON PLANTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis eminent scientist was born in Orthez (Department of\r\nBasses-Pyrénées) on the 22d of April, 1834; at present in his fiftieth\r\nyear.

His parents were\r\npoor, and \"Warren\" was, during his childhood, frequently employed in\r\ndifferent manufacturing establishments to aid the family by his small\r\nearnings.\r\n\r\nIn early boyhood he manifested an unusual taste for mathematics, and\r\nin the common district school was regarded as remarkable in this\r\ndepartment. He learned the trade of a machinist, studying winters, until\r\nhe was over twenty-two years of age, when he began to fit for Harvard\r\nCollege, which he entered in 1817 and graduated with high honors in\r\n1820. He taught school in the winter months, while in college, in\r\nBoston, Leominster, and in Canton, Mass. From 1820 to 1823 he taught a\r\nselect school in Boston.\r\n\r\nWhile in college he was regarded as by far the best mathematician in his\r\nclass, and during this period thought there was the necessity for such a\r\nbook as his \"First Lessons in Intellectual Arithmetic.\" This conviction\r\nhad been forced upon his mind by his experience in teaching. In the\r\nautumn of 1821 he published his \"first edition.\" His plan was well\r\ndigested, although he was accustomed to say that \"the pupils who were\r\nunder his tuition made his arithmetic for him;\" that the questions they\r\nasked and the necessary answers and explanations which he gave in reply\r\nwere embodied in the book, which has had a sale unprecedented for\r\nany book on elementary arithmetic in the world, having reached over\r\n2,000,000 copies in this country, and the sale still continues, both in\r\nthis country and in Great Britain. It has been translated into most of\r\nthe European languages and by missionaries into many Asiatic languages.\r\n\r\nAfter teaching in Boston about two and one-half years, he was chosen\r\nsuperintendent of the Boston Manufacturing Company's works at Waltham,\r\nMass., and accepted the position; and in August, 1824, owing to the\r\nmechanical genius he displayed in applying power to machinery, combined\r\nwith his great administrative ability, he was appointed superintendent\r\nof the Lowell Merrimac Manufacturing Co., at Lowell, Mass. Here he\r\nprojected a system of lectures of an instructive character, presenting\r\ncommerce and useful subjects in such a way as to gain attention and\r\nenlighten the people.\r\n\r\nFor several years he delivered gratuitous lectures on the Natural\r\nHistory of Animals, Light, Electricity, the Seasons, Hydraulics,\r\nEclipses, etc. His knowledge of machinery enabled him admirably to\r\nillustrate these lectures by models of his own construction; and his\r\nsuccessful experiments and simple teaching added much to the practical\r\nknowledge of his operatives.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to occupy the space between the common schools and the\r\ncollege halls by carrying, so far as might be practicable, the design of\r\nthe Rumford Lectures of Harvard into the community of the actual workers\r\nof common life.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time he discharged his official duties efficiently, and the\r\nsuperintendence of the schools of Lowell was also added to his labors.\r\nHe never relinquished, during these busy years, the design formed in his\r\ncollege days of furnishing to the children of the country a series of\r\ntext-books on the _inductive plan_ in mathematics.\r\n\r\nHis \"Algebra upon the Inductive Method of Instruction,\" appeared in\r\n1825, and his \"Sequel to Intellectual Arithmetic\" in 1836. He regarded\r\nthe \"Sequel\" as a book of more merit and importance than the \"First\r\nLessons.\"\r\n\r\nHe also published a series of selections from Miss Edgeworth's stories,\r\nin a suitable form for reading exercises for the younger classes of\r\nthe Lowell schools, in the use of which the teachers were carefully\r\ninstructed.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1827, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of\r\nSciences. For several years he was a member of the Examining Committee\r\nfor Mathematics at Harvard College.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the Superintending School Committee of Lowell; and so\r\nbusy were he and his coworkers that they were repeatedly obliged to hold\r\ntheir meetings at six o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nWarren Colburn was ardently admired--almost revered--by the teachers who\r\nwere trained to use his \"Inductive Methods of Instruction\" in teaching\r\nelementary mathematics.\r\n\r\nIn personal appearance Mr. Colburn was decidedly pleasing. His height\r\nwas five feet ten, and his figure was well proportioned. His face\r\nwas one not to be forgotten; it indicated sweetness of disposition,\r\nbenevolence, intelligence, and refinement. His mental operations were\r\nnot rapid, and it was only by great patience and long continued thought\r\nthat he achieved his objects. He was not fluent in conversation; his\r\nhesitancy of speech, however, was not so great when with friends as\r\nwith strangers. The tendency of his mind was toward the practical in\r\nknowledge; his study was to simplify science, and to make it accessible\r\nto common minds.\r\n\r\nMr. Colburn will live in educational history as the author of \"Warren\r\nColburn's First Lessons,\" one of the very best books ever written, and\r\nwhich, for a quarter of a century, was in almost universal use as a\r\ntext-book in the best common schools, not only in the primary and\r\nintermediate grades, but also in the grammar school classes.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the method of this famous book, the pupils were\r\ntaught in a natural way, a knowledge of the fundamental principles of\r\narithmetic. By its use they developed the ability to solve mentally and\r\nwith great facility all of the simple questions likely to occur in the\r\nevery day business of common life.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Pestalozzi first conceived the idea of the true \"inductive\r\nmethod\" of teaching numbers; but it was Mr. Colburn who adapted it to\r\nthe needs of the children of the common elementary schools. It has\r\nwrought a great change in teaching, and placed Warren Colburn on the\r\nroll as one of the educational benefactors of his age.\r\n\r\nHe died at Lowell, Mass., Sept. 13, 1883, at the age of 90\r\nyears.--_Journal of Education_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURY'S DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThury's dynamo-electric machine, which presents some peculiarities,\r\nhas never to our knowledge been employed outside of Sweden and a few\r\nneighboring regions; but this is doubtless due to some personal motive\r\nor other of its constructors, since it has, it would seem, given\r\nexcellent results in every application that has been made of it. It is\r\nrepresented in perspective in Fig. 1, and in longitudinal section and\r\nelevation in Figs. 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, it is a multipolar (6-pole) machine in which an attempt\r\nhas been made to utilize magnetically, as far as possible, all the iron\r\nused in the frame. For this reason the system has been given the form of\r\na hexagonal prism, whose faces are formed of flat electro-magnets, A, A,\r\nxxx, constituting the inductors.\r\n\r\nThe internal angles of this prism are filled by polar expansions, P, P,\r\nxxx, alternately north and south, that thus form in the interior of the\r\napparatus an inscribed cylinder designed to receive the armature. This\r\nlatter belongs to the kinds that are wound upon a cylinder in which the\r\nwire is external thereto.\r\n\r\nThe conductors are placed upon the iron drum longitudinally and parallel\r\nwith its axis. But instead of being connected with each other at the\r\nposterier end of the armature, as in the Siemens system, they are\r\nconnected according to chords that correspond to a fourth, a sixth,\r\nor any equal fraction whatever of the circumference. Fig. 4 gives a\r\nperspective view of the cylinder, upon which the conductors 1, 2, 3,\r\n4, and so on, are placed according to generatrices. The armature is\r\nsupposed to be divided into six parts, each conductor passing over the\r\nbases of the drum through a chord equal to the radius, that is to say,\r\ncorresponding to a sixth of the circumference.\r\n\r\nThree conductors are all connected together in such a way as to form\r\nbut a single circuit closed upon itself. Conductor 1, for example, is\r\nconnected with No. 6 in such a way that the end issuing from 1 becomes\r\nthe end that enters No. 6. Conductor No. 3 is connected in the same way\r\nwith No. 8, and so on, up to the last conductor, which is connected in\r\nits turn with the end that enters the first.\r\n\r\nAs the figure shows, the conductor before passing from 3 to 8, for\r\nexample, returns several times upon itself in following 6 and 3, and the\r\nsame is the case with all the rest of the winding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF THE THURY MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nIn this way the cylinder becomes inclosed within nine rectangular wire\r\nframes, each of which is connected with the following one by a conductor\r\nthat is at the same time connected with one of the nine plates of\r\nthe collector. The number of the rubbers corresponds to that of the\r\ninducting poles. They may be coupled in different ways, but they are in\r\nmost cases united for quantity.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Thury armature resembles, in the system of\r\nwinding, those of the Siemens machines and their derivatives. But it\r\ndiffers from these, however, in the details connected with the coupling\r\nof the wires, from the very fact that the features of a two-pole machine\r\nare not found exactly in a multipolar one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 2 AND 3.]\r\n\r\nThis latter kind of machine is considered advantageous by its inventors,\r\nin that there is no need of revolving it with much velocity. It must not\r\nbe forgotten, however, that although we reduce the velocity by this mode\r\nof construction, we are, on another hand, obliged to increase the size\r\nof the machine, so that, according to the circumstances under which we\r\nchanced to be placed, the advantage may now be on the one side and now\r\non the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 4 AND 5.]\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that Fig. 4 is essentially diagrammatic, and is\r\ndesigned to give a clearer idea of the mode of winding the armature. In\r\npractice the number of the frames, and consequently that of the plates\r\nof the conductor, is much greater, and the arrangement that we have\r\ndescribed is repeated a certain number of times, the conducter always\r\nforming a circuit that is closed upon itself.\r\n\r\nThe Thury machines are constructed in different styles. No. 1 is a\r\n100-lamp (16 candles and 100 volts) machine, and Nos. 2 and 3 are\r\nnominally 250-lamp ones, but may be more. Their weight is 1,100\r\nkilogrammes, and their velocity, for 100 volts, is from 400 to 500\r\nrevolutions, according to the mode of coupling.\r\n\r\nA later type, now in course of construction, is to furnish from 750 to\r\n2,000 lamps, with 250 revolutions, for 100 volts, and is not to weigh\r\nmore than 2,000 kilogrammes. Let us add that Messrs. Meuron and Cuenod,\r\nthe manufacturers, have likewise applied their mode of winding to\r\nconductors arranged radially upon the surface of a circle. Fig. 5 shows\r\nthis arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn this case the inductors will, it is unnecessary to say, be arranged\r\nlaterally as in all flat ring machines. The arrangement will recall, for\r\nexample, that of the Victoria machines (Brush-Mordey).\r\n\r\nWe do not think that the inventors have applied this radial arrangement\r\npractically, for it does not appear to be advantageous. The parts of\r\nconductors which are perpendicular to the radius, and which can be only\r\ninert (even if they do not become the seat of disadvantageous currents),\r\nhave, in fact, too great an importance with respect to the radial\r\nparts.--_A. Guerout, in La Lumiere Electrique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREGUET'S TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. G. Forbes gives the following description: The instrument which\r\nI call Breguét's telephone is founded upon the instrument which was\r\ndescribed by Lipmann, called the capillary electrometer. The phenomenon\r\nmay be shown in a variety of ways. One of the easiest methods to show it\r\nis by taking a long glass tube and bending it into two glasses of dilute\r\nacid, and, the tube being filled with acid itself, a piece of mercury\r\nis placed in the center of the tube. Then if one pole of a battery is\r\nconnected with one vessel of acid, and the other pole of the battery is\r\nconnected with the other vessel of acid, at the moment of connection the\r\nbit of mercury will be seen to travel to the right or left, according to\r\nthe direction of the current. M. Lipmann explained the action by showing\r\nthat the electro-motive force which is generated tends to alter the\r\nconvexity of the surface of the mercury. The surface of the mercury,\r\nlooked at from one side, has a convex form, which is altered by the\r\nelectro-motive force set up when connection is made with the battery.\r\nThe equilibrium of the mercury is dependent upon the convexity, and\r\nconsequently when the convexity is disturbed the mercury moves to one\r\nside or the other. Lipmann also showed that if a tube containing a bit\r\nof mercury, and tapering to a point, is taken and dipped into acid, and\r\nthen the tube filled with acid, on one pole of a battery being dipped\r\ninto the tube and another into the acid the mercury will move up or\r\ndown, showing similar action to that which I have just described.\r\n\r\nLipmann further showed the reverse effect, that if a piece of mercury be\r\nforcibly pressed, so as to alter the convexity of its surface, such\r\nas by bringing it into a narrower part of the tube, then there is an\r\nelectro-motive force produced.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me, and no doubt it did to Breguet also, that if we speak\r\neither against the surface of the glass tube, and caused the tube to\r\nvibrate, or if the mercury were caused to vibrate in the manner I have\r\nshown, we ought to be able to introduce a varying current in the wires\r\nwhich might have sufficient electro-motive force to produce audible\r\nspeech in a Bell telephone. Further, the same instrument, since varying\r\nelectro-motive force affected the drop of mercury and produced varying\r\ndisplacement, ought also to act as a receiving instrument, and should\r\nvibrate in accordance with the currents that arrive. My experiments\r\nhave only been in the way of using the instrument as a transmitter; but\r\nBreguét, I find, used it as a receiver as well as a transmitter, though\r\nI am not aware that M. Breguet made any actual experiments so as to\r\nproduce articulate speech. I presume that this was done, although I have\r\nnot come across any description of the experiments, and it was for that\r\nreason that I thought possibly some account of my own experiments might\r\nbe interesting to the members of the Society. The first tubes that I\r\nused were bits of glass tube about a centimeter diameter, and simply\r\ndrawn out to a tapering point. I have the tubes here. The first\r\nexperiment I tried was by tapping the glass tube so as to mechanically\r\nshift the position of the mercury, and by listening on the telephone for\r\nthe effect. For a long time, at least an hour, I could get no effect at\r\nall. At last I got a sound, but could not understand how it was that at\r\none time of tapping I could not hear, while at another time it was quite\r\nloud.\r\n\r\nAt the top I always got sound, but at the side I got no sound, although\r\nthe mercury was shaking. I then tried to see how feeble a current was\r\naudible in the telephone. An assistant tapped the tube while I stood out\r\nof the way, and where I could not see. I got him to tap it gentler and\r\ngentler, and could hear the most feeble tap. A pellet of paper was next\r\ndropped from various heights down to an inch, and each tap was perfectly\r\naudible in the telephone. I tried many methods, and one, purely\r\naccidentally chosen, was a piece of glass tube which I had drawn out\r\ninto a tube about 2 mm. diameter, and then nearly closed the end of\r\nit. I have that tube here, and you will see what an ill-shapen and\r\nugly-looking tube it is, but it is one of the best tubes I ever got; and\r\nfinally, I found that small bits of thermometer tube, which were simply\r\nclosed at their ends with a blow-pipe, gave very good results, and I was\r\nable to make them useful for various purposes. I then tried mounting a\r\ntube on the end of a speaking-trumpet and speaking to the mercury, but\r\ngot no effect. In every place where I attached the glass tube itself\r\nto a sounding-board I got a very accurate reproduction. I put one on a\r\npiece of ferrotype plate, and that gave really the best result I ever\r\ngot. The tube was fastened with sealing-wax, and with it I got excellent\r\nspeech heard in a Bell receiver. I tried putting in a large number of\r\nthese tubes, all in quantity, on the bottom of a ferrotype plate, but\r\nwith no advantage. I have not yet tried putting them in series, one\r\nbehind the other, so as to increase the electro-motive force, but I\r\nthink that probably would be an improvement; of course it would require\r\nmany vessels of acidulated water to dip into. The most distinct\r\narticulate speech was obtained from an ordinary ferrotype telephone\r\nplate, secured at the edges, and one of the glass tubes you see here\r\nattached to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUNRO'S TELEPHONIC EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. J. Munro, whose name is well known not only as a very clear writer\r\nupon electrical subjects, but as an original investigator, has recently,\r\nwith the assistance of Mr. Benjamin Warwick, been conducting a most\r\ninteresting experimental investigation of the action of the microphone\r\nas a telephonic transmitter, with the result of proving that metals may\r\nadvantageously be employed in the place of carbon in a transmitting\r\ninstrument, a practical development of one of the very earliest of\r\nProfessor Hughes' microphones. The fact that metallic electrodes can\r\npractically be employed in microphonic transmitters has been denied of\r\nlate with so much assurance and in such high quarters, that Mr. Munro's\r\nsuccessful applications of that portion of Professor Hughes' discovery\r\npossess an especial interest, and must to a considerable extent affect\r\nthe aspect of litigation in future contests in which the discovery of\r\nthe microphone and the invention of the carbon transmitter are vital\r\npoints at issue.\r\n\r\nIn investigating the properties of metallic conductors employed in the\r\nconstruction of microphones, Mr. Munro's first experiments were made\r\nwith wires. These, in some cases, were caused by the action of a\r\ndiaphragm, to rub the one on the other in such a manner as to make the\r\npoint of contact vary (under the influence of the vibrations of the\r\ndiaphragms) on one side or other of a position of normal potential, so\r\nthat by the movement of a wire attached to a vibrating tympan along a\r\nfixed wire conveying a current from a battery, and thereby shunting the\r\ncurrent at various positions along the length of the fixed wire, the\r\nstrength of the current in the derived circuit, in which was included a\r\nsuitable receiver, was varied accordingly. In other experiments mercury\r\nwas employed, either as a sliding-drop, inclosing the fixed wire, or as\r\nan oscillating column; but these experiments, though instructive and\r\ninteresting, did not for various reasons give encouraging results with a\r\nview to the practical application of the principle.\r\n\r\nThey, however, led Mr. Munro to proceed with compound wire structures,\r\nsuch as gratings resting upon or rubbing against one another, and one of\r\nthe first experiments in this direction proved very successful, and led\r\nMr. Munro to the construction of his gauze telephone, which is the most\r\ncharacteristic and efficient of his practical apparatus.\r\n\r\nThis instrument consists essentially of two pieces of iron-wire gauze,\r\nthe one fixed in a vertical plane, and the other resting more or less\r\nlightly against it, the pressure between them being regulated by an\r\nadjustable spring or weight. These gauze plates are so connected in a\r\ntelephonic circuit as to constitute the electrodes of a microphone; for\r\ntouching one another lightly in several points, they allow the current\r\nto be transmitted between them in inverse proportion to the resistance\r\noffered to it in its passage from one to the other. Under the influence\r\nof sonorous vibrations the one plate dances more or less on the other,\r\nthus varying the resistance; and very perfect articulation is produced\r\nin a telephonic receiver included in the circuit. The gauze transmitter\r\nso constructed may be fixed within a wall-box with or without a\r\nmouthpiece; but as the sound waves acting directly upon the gauze plates\r\nset them into agitation through their sympathetic vibration or by direct\r\nimpact, no sort of diaphragm or equivalent device is necessary, and none\r\nis employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nA convenient form of this apparatus is shown in Fig. 1, and to which the\r\nname of \"The Lyre Telephone\" has been given from its resemblance to that\r\nimpossible musical instrument. In this apparatus, G¹ is a plate of iron\r\nwire gauze stretched vertically between two horizontal wires attached to\r\na lyre-shaped framework of mahogany; against the plate rests the smaller\r\nplate, G², the normal pressure between them being regulated by an\r\nadjustable spring acting in opposition to a weighted lever, W. The two\r\nplates are connected respectively with the attachment screws, X and\r\nY, by which the instrument is placed in a circuit with a battery and\r\ntelephonic circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nA modification of this apparatus is shown in the diagram sketch, Fig.\r\n2, which will probably be a more practical form. In this instrument the\r\nelectrodes consist of two circular disks of iron wire gauze of different\r\ndiameters, the larger disk, G¹, which is fixed, being pierced with holes\r\nof smaller diameter than the smaller disk, G². In the diagram the two\r\ndisks are shown separated for the purpose of explanation, but in reality\r\nthey rest the one against the other; the smaller and movable disk,\r\nG², is held up against G¹ with greater or less pressure by the spiral\r\nspring, S, the tension of which can be adjusted by a screw or other\r\nsuitable device at N. This form of the apparatus is more suitable for\r\ninclosure in a wall box with or without a mouthpiece, but it does not\r\nrequire the employment of any kind of diaphragm or tympan. Mr. Munro\r\ncan employ with all his instruments an induction coil for installations\r\nwhere the resistance of the line wire makes it desirable to do so; the\r\nmicrophone and battery being included in the primary circuit and the\r\ntelephones in the secondary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nFig. 3 is an ingenious arrangement devised by Mr. Munro, in which the\r\nadjusting spring or weight is substituted by a magnet which may be\r\neither a permanent or an electro-magnet. The figure shows an arrangement\r\nin which the fixed gauze, g¹, is perforated as in the apparatus\r\nillustrated in Fig. 2, and the movable electrode, g, is bent or dished\r\nso as to press upon g¹ around its edge. E is a magnet which by its\r\nattractive influence upon g holds t up against g¹ with a pressure\r\ndependent upon its magnetic intensity and upon its distance from the\r\ngauze. By making E an electro-magnet, and including its coil in the\r\ntelephonic circuit, an instrument may be constructed in which the normal\r\npressure between the electrodes can be automatically adjusted to the\r\nstrength of the current, and in cases where an induction coil is\r\nemployed the magnet, E, may be the core of such a coil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nFig. 4 illustrates an apparatus devised by Mr. Munro, and to which the\r\nname thermo-microphone might be given, as it is a microphone in which\r\nthermo-electric currents are employed in the place of voltaic currents,\r\nits special feature of interest lying in the fact that the heated\r\njunction of the thermo-electric couple is identical with the microphone\r\ncontacts of the two electrodes. In this very elegant experiment a piece\r\nof iron wire gauze, G, is supported in a horizontal position by a light\r\nmetallic support, B. To another support. A, is loosely hinged a frame,\r\nwhich at its further extremity carries a little coil of German silver\r\nwire, C, which by its weight rests upon the center of the gauze plate,\r\nG; and in contact therewith, and to increase the pressure of contact, a\r\nlittle bar weight is laid within the convolutions of the core. The\r\ntwo electrodes, the gauze, and the coil are connected, as shown, to a\r\nreceiving telephone, T. Upon the application of heat, as from the flame\r\nof a spirit lamp placed below, a thermo-electric current is set up\r\nthroughout the circuit; in this condition the apparatus becomes a very\r\nperfect microphone, and when the pressure between the electrodes is\r\nproperly adjusted it is a very efficient telephonic transmitter,\r\ntransmitting articulate speech and musical sounds with remarkable\r\nclearness and fidelity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\r\n\r\nMr. Munro is, with the aid of Mr. Warwick's manipulative skill,\r\nextending this portion of his investigation further by experimenting\r\nwith gauzes and coils of various metals forming other couples in\r\nthe thermo-electric series, as well as with iron and other gauzes\r\nelectrotyped with bismuth and other metals, and we hope in due time to\r\nlay the results of those experiments before our readers.\r\n\r\nMr. Munro has, moreover, observed that if two pieces of gauze of\r\nidentical material and in microphonic contact be heated, a peculiar\r\nsighing sound is heard in a telephone connected with them and with a\r\nbattery, and he attributes this phenomenon to the electrical discharge\r\nbetween the gauze plates being facilitated and increased by the\r\naction of heat, but we are rather inclined to trace the effect to the\r\nmechanical action of the one gauze moving over the other under the\r\ninfluence of expansion and contraction of the metals by the variable\r\ntemperature of the flame and convection currents of heated air, such\r\nmovement producing the sounds just as would be produced if one of the\r\nelectrodes of an ordinary microphone were as delicately moved by the\r\nhand or other agent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6]\r\n\r\nFigs. 5 and 6 illustrate another and distinct form of metallic\r\nmicrophone transmitter designed by Mr. Munro and Mr. Warwick, in which\r\na small chain, preferably of iron, forms the microphonic portion of the\r\napparatus. In Fig. 5, A is a plate of sonorous wood forming a diaphragm\r\nor collector of the sonorous waves; to the back of this is attached a\r\nshort length of chain, C, the opposite ends of which are by the wires, X\r\nand Y, included in the telephonic circuit. The points of junction of the\r\nlinks with one another constitute the variable microphonic contacts, and\r\nthe normal pressure between them is adjusted by the spiral spring, S,\r\nthe tension of which may be varied by the cord and winding pin, B. Fig.\r\n6 is the section of a transmitter constructed upon this principle, and\r\nin which two chains, c and c', are employed attached at one end by a\r\nwire, f, to a diaphragm mouthpiece, N, and at their opposite extremities\r\nto the adjusting springs, s and s'; an induction coil, D, may be\r\nemployed if the resistance of the line render it advantageous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7]\r\n\r\nFig. 7 is a form of pencil microphone experimented with by Mr. Munro,\r\nwhich differs from some of the Hughes' transmitters adopted by Crossley,\r\nGower, Ader, and many others only in the material of which it is\r\ncomposed, Mr. Munro's being of cast iron, while the others to which we\r\nhave referred are of carbon rods such as are used in electric lighting.\r\nIn Fig. 7 a light cast-iron bar, i², of the form shown, is supported in\r\nholes drilled in two blocks of cast iron, i i', and the pressure between\r\nthe bar and the blocks can be adjusted by a regulating spring, s. In\r\nconnection with this apparatus Mr. Munro has observed that rust has no\r\nappreciable effect upon the efficiency of the instrument unless it be\r\nto such an extent as to cause the two to adhere, or to be \"rusted up\"\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8]\r\n\r\nWe now come to another class of metallic transmitters with which Mr.\r\nMunro and his associate have been making experiments, and to which he\r\nhas given the name \"Grain transmitter,\" since it consists of a box\r\nhaving metallic sides, e e', to which terminal screws, t t', are\r\nattached and filled in between with iron or brass filings, granules of\r\nspongy iron, or indeed small metallic particles in any form; one of the\r\nmost efficient transmitters being a box such as is shown in Fig. 8,\r\nfilled with a quantity of ¼ in. screws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9]\r\n\r\nThe results of Mr. Munro's experiments have led him to the opinion\r\nthat the action of the microphone must be attributed to the action\r\nof sonorous vibrations upon the air or gaseous medium separating the\r\nso-called contact-points of the electrodes, and that across these\r\nspaces, or films of gaseous matter, silent electrical discharges take\r\nplace, the strengths of which, being determined by the thickness of the\r\ngaseous strata through which they pass, vary with the motion of the\r\nelectrodes; and as, according to this hypothesis, the distances of the\r\nelectrodes from one another is determined by the sound-waves, the sound\r\nin that way controls the current.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR MANEUVRING BICHROMATE OF POTASSA PILES FROM A DISTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBichromate of potassa piles, especially those single liquid ones that\r\nare applied to domestic lighting, all present the grave defect of\r\nconsuming almost as much zinc in open as in closed circuit, and of\r\nbecoming rapidly exhausted if care be not taken to remove the zinc from\r\nthe liquid when the battery is not in use. This operation, which is a\r\npurely mechanical one, has hitherto required the pile to be located near\r\nthe place where it was to be used, or to have at one's disposal a system\r\nof mechanical transmission that was complicated and not very ornamental.\r\n\r\nIn order to do away with this inconvenience, which is inherent to all\r\nbichromate piles, Mr. G. Mareschal has invented and had constructed an\r\ningenious system that we shall now describe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--BICHROMATE OF POTASSIUM PILE, WITH MANEUVERING\r\nAPPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nMr. Mareschal's plan consists in suspending the frame that carries all\r\nthe battery zincs (Fig. 1) from the extremity of a horizontal beam, and\r\nbalancing them by means of weights at the other extremity.\r\n\r\nThe system, being balanced, the lifting or immersion of the zincs then\r\nonly requires a slight mechanical power, such as may be obtained from\r\nan ordinary kitchen jack through a combination that will be readily\r\nunderstood upon reference to Fig. 2. The axis, M, of the jack,\r\non revolving, carries along a crank, MD, to which is fixed a\r\nconnecting-rod, A, whose other extremity is attached to the horizontal\r\nbeam that supports the zincs and counterpoises. If the axle, M, be given\r\na continuous revolution, it will communicate to the rod, A, an upward\r\nand downward motion that will be transmitted to the beam and produce an\r\nalternate immersion and emersion of the zincs.\r\n\r\nUpon stopping the jack at certain properly selected positions of the\r\nrod, MD, the zincs may, at will, be kept immersed in the liquids, or\r\n_vice versa_. This is brought about by Mr. Mareschal in the following\r\nway: The jack carries along in its motion a horizontal fly-wheel, V,\r\nagainst whose rim there bears an iron shoe, F, placed opposite an\r\nelectro-magnet, E. In the ordinary position, this shoe, which is fixed\r\nto a spring, bears against the felly of the wheel and stops the jack\r\nthrough friction. When a current is sent into the electro-magnet, E, the\r\nbrake shoe, F, is attracted, leaves the fly wheel, and sets free the\r\njack, which continues to revolve until the current ceases to pass into\r\nthe electro.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--PRINCIPLE OF THE APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe problem, then, is reduced to sending a current into the electro and\r\nin shutting it off at the proper moment. This result is obtained very\r\nsimply by means of an auxiliary Leclauche pile. (The piles got up for\r\nhouse bells will answer.) The current from this pile is cut off from\r\nthe electro, F, by means of a button, B, when it is desired to light or\r\nextinguish the lamps. In a position of rest, for example, the crank, MD,\r\nis vertical, as shown in the diagram to the right in Fig. 2. The circuit\r\nis open between M and N through the effect of the small rod, C, which\r\nseparates the spring, R, from the spring, R'. As soon as the circuit has\r\nbeen closed, be it only for an instant, the crank leaves its vertical\r\nposition, the rod, C, quits the bend, S, and the spring, R, by virtue of\r\nits elasticity, touches the spring, R', and continues its contact until\r\nthe crank, MD, having made a half revolution, the rod, C', repulses the\r\nspring, R, and breaks the circuit anew. The brake then acts, and the\r\ncrank stops after making a revolution of 180°, and immersing the\r\nzincs to a maximum depth. In order to extinguish the lamp, it is only\r\nnecessary to press the button, B, again. The axle, M, will then make\r\nanother half revolution, and, when it stops, the zinks will be entirely\r\nout of the liquid. The depth of immersion is regulated by fixing the\r\ncrank-pin. D, in the apertures, T1, or T2, of the connecting rod. This\r\npermits the travel, and consequently the degree of immersion, to be\r\nvaried.\r\n\r\nThe device requires three wires, two for connecting the lamp with the\r\nbattery, and one for maneuvering the apparatus through a closing of the\r\ncontact, B.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Mareschal's system, bichromate of potassa piles may be utilized\r\nin a large number of cases where a light of but short duration is\r\nrequired until the battery is exhausted, without the tedious maneuvering\r\nof a winch and without inconvenience. The jack permits of a large number\r\nof lightings and extinctions being effected before it becomes necessary\r\nto wind up its clockwork movement. This operation, however, is very\r\nsimple, and may be performed every time the battery is visited in order\r\nto see what state it is in.\r\n\r\nWe regard Mr. Mareschal's apparatus as an indispensable addition to\r\nevery case of domestic electric lighting in which bichromate of potassa\r\npiles are used, and, in general, to all cases where the pile becomes\r\nuselessly exhausted in open circuit. It will likewise find an\r\napplication in laboratories, where the bichromate pile is in much demand\r\nbecause of its powerful qualities, and where it is often necessary to\r\norder it from quite a distant point.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC ROTATIONS.\r\n\r\nBy E. L. VOICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remarkable researches and experiments of Professor Hughes clearly\r\nshow that magnetism is totally independent of iron, and that its\r\nmolecules, particles, or polarities are capable of rotation in that\r\nmetal. It would also appear that by reason of the friction between\r\nmagnetism and iron, the molecules of the latter are only partially\r\nmoved, such movement being the result of the tendency of iron to retard\r\nmagnetic change.\r\n\r\nI have found that the magnetic molecules also possess inertia, that they\r\nare capable of acquiring momentum, and that their rotation continues\r\nfor a considerable time after the exciting cause of their rotation has\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nThese facts may be proved in a very evident manner, inasmuch as induced\r\nelectric currents are generated by this _after_ rotation, which may be\r\nmade to light incandescent lamps.\r\n\r\nIn this case the magnetic rotations are produced in an electro magnet by\r\nmeans of alternate currents supplied by alternating Gramme machine.\r\n\r\nIn order to better explain the action, it will be necessary to refer\r\nto a new electro-motor, which was the subject of an article in the\r\n_Electrical Review_ of February 19 last. It is of that type of motor in\r\nwhich the field magnet and armature poles are alternately arranged, and\r\nwhich requires a periodical reversibility of magnetism in the armature\r\nto cause the latter to revolve, as in the Griscom motor. The insulating\r\nstrips in the commutator are sufficiently wide to demagnetize the whole\r\nof the machine before reversibility in the armature takes place, and\r\nthis demagnetization sets up a _direct_ induced current, which is caught\r\nin a shunt circuit by the aid of a second commutator, which only comes\r\ninto action when the first commutator goes out.\r\n\r\nWhen this motor is supplied by a continuous current, it is easy to\r\nunderstand that the induced current which passes through the shunt\r\ncircuit, and which is caused by the demagnetization, is proportional\r\nto the mass of iron and wire of which the machine is composed, or\r\nproportional to its inductive capacity. This current is purely a\r\nsecondary effect, of short duration, and only occurs once at each break\r\nof the commutator.\r\n\r\nThe motor is of such a size that when supplied with a continuous current\r\nof proper strength the induced electrical effect in the shunt circuit\r\nwill light one incandescent lamp. If, however, it is supplied with an\r\nalternating current of the same power, it will light eight lamps, and\r\nthe mechanical power given off is even more than with a continuous\r\ncurrent, provided that the alternations from the dynamo do not exceed\r\n6,000 a minute.\r\n\r\nAt first I was considerably puzzled by this great difference, because in\r\nboth cases it is impossible for the lamp circuit to be acted upon by the\r\nmain current. It occurred to me, however, that the rapid alternations\r\nof the exciting current from the dynamo, and the consequent speed of\r\nmagnetic molecular rotation, gave the latter a certain momentum, and\r\nthat by widening the insulating strips of the first or main current\r\ncommutator, and proportionately increasing the width of conducting\r\nsurface in the shunt commutator up to certain limits, this effect would\r\nbe increased. I found such to be the case, from which I inferred that\r\nthe increase of induced current in the shunt circuit was on account of\r\nits longer duration, by reason of the acquired momentum of the magnetic\r\nmolecular rotations _after_ the alternating exciting current had ceased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThose who have facilities for carrying out experiments may prove it in\r\nthe following manner:\r\n\r\nE, in the inclosed drawing, is an electro-magnet whose brushes press on\r\ntwo metallic bands, B and B¹, fixed to but insulated from the spindle,\r\nA. The band, B, is in electrical circuit with the shunt commutator, S,\r\nand the main commutator, M; while the band, B¹, is in contact with\r\nshunt commutator, S¹, and main commutator, M¹. This contact is made\r\nby conducting rods, as indicated. The commutators, as regards their\r\nbrushes, are so arranged that when M and M¹ are in action, S and S¹ are\r\nout of action, and _vice versa_. The spindle and commutators are rotated\r\nby the pulley, P. L is an incandescent lamp in the shunt circuit.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose the apparatus at rest, and the brushes in electrical\r\ncontact with the main commutators, M and M¹. The current from an\r\nalternating dynamo passes into the magnet, E, and rapidly reverses its\r\npolarity. By actuating the pulley, P, the commutators are rotated, when\r\nM and M¹ go out of, and the shunt commutators, S and S¹, come into\r\naction, enabling the _after_ current set up in the magnet to light the\r\nlamp, L, in the shunt circuit.\r\n\r\nIn order to make comparative tests, the same apparatus may be supplied\r\nwith continuous instead of alternating currents. The after current in\r\nthe former case, however, is much smaller, consisting of one electrical\r\nimpulse only at each break of the commutator, whereas in the alternating\r\nsystem these impulses are practically continued; the result being that,\r\nall things being equal, a far greater number of lamps may be used in the\r\nshunt than when supplied by continuous current only, and it would\r\nappear that this difference can only be attributed to the fact that the\r\nrotatory motion of magnetic molecules, or polarity of the magnet, E,\r\nacquires momentum when acted upon by a suitable physical cause, such as\r\nalternating currents of electricity; this momentum lasting a sensible\r\ntime after the cessation of the acting cause.\r\n\r\nIf we had the gift of magnetic sight, and could see what is going on in\r\nthe electro-magnet when it is excited by alternating currents, we should\r\nprobably see the molecules or polarities tumbling over each other at an\r\nenormous rate. I do not think, however, that we should see anything but\r\na vibratory motion as regards the iron molecules.--_Elec. Review_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[AMER. MICROSCOP. JOUR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTON'S IMMERSION ILLUMINATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extremely simple plan for an immersion illuminator was\r\nfirst brought to the notice of microscopists a few years ago, and,\r\nin the absence of the inventor, was kindly described by Prof. Albert\r\nMcCalla, at the meeting of the American Society of Microscopists, at\r\nColumbus, O. It consists of a small disk of silvered plate glass, c,\r\nabout one-eighth of an inch thick, which is cemented by glycerine\r\nor some homogeneous immersion medium to the under surface of the\r\nglass-slide, s. Let r represent the silvered surface of the glass disk,\r\nb, the immersion objective, f, the thin glass cover. It will be easily\r\nseen that the ray of light, h, from the mirror or condenser above the\r\nstage will enter the slide and thence be refracted to the silvered\r\nsurface of the illuminator, r, whence it is reflected at a corresponding\r\nangle to the object in the focus of the objective. A shield to prevent\r\nunnecessary light from entering the objective can be made of any\r\nmaterial at hand, by taking a strip one inch long and three-fourths\r\nof an inch wide and turning up one end. A hole not more than\r\nthree-sixteenths of an inch in diameter should be made at the angle. The\r\nshield should be placed on the upper surface of the slide, so that the\r\nhole will cover the point where the light from the mirror enters the\r\nglass. With this illuminator Möller's balsam test-plate is resolved\r\nwith ease, with suitable objectives. Diatoms mounted dry are shown in\r\na manner far surpassing that by the usual arrangement of mirror,\r\nparticularly with large angle dry objectives.\r\n\r\nOttumwa, Ia.\r\n\r\nWM.

PROCTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nScience owes to M. Foucault the suggestion that the motions of a\r\npendulum so suspended as to be free to swing in any vertical plane\r\nmight be made to give ocular demonstration of the earth's rotation. The\r\nprinciple of proof may be easily exhibited, though, like nearly all of\r\nthe evidences of the earth's rotation, the complete theory of the\r\nmatter can only be mastered by the aid of mathematical researches of\r\nconsiderable complexity. Suppose A B (Fig. 1) to be a straight rod in a\r\nhorizontal position bearing the free pendulum C D suspended in some such\r\nmanner as is indicated at C; and suppose the pendulum to be set swinging\r\nin the direction of the length of the rod A B, so that the bob D remains\r\nthroughout the oscillations vertically under the rod A B. Now, if A B be\r\nshifted in the manner indicated by the arrows, its horizontality being\r\npreserved, it will be found that the pendulum does not partake in this\r\nmotion. Thus, if the direction of A B was north and south at first, so\r\nthat the pendulum was set swinging in a north and south direction, it\r\nwill be found that, the pendulum will still swing in that direction,\r\neven though the rod be made to take up an east and west position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nNor will it matter if we suppose B (say) fixed and the rod shifted by\r\nmoving the end A horizontally round B. Further, as this is true whatever\r\nthe length of the rod, it is clear that the same fixity of the plane\r\nof swing will be observed if the rod be shifted horizontally as though\r\nforming part of a radial line from a point E in its length. In these\r\ncases the plane of the pendulum's swing will indeed be shifted _bodily_,\r\nbut the direction of swing will still continue to be from north to\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nNow, let P O P' represent the polar axis of the earth; a b a horizontal\r\nrod at the pole bearing a pendulum, as in Fig. 1. It is clear that if\r\nthe earth is rotating about P O P' in the direction shown by the arrow,\r\nthe rod a b is being shifted round, precisely as in the case first\r\nconsidered. The swinging pendulum below it will not partake in its\r\nmotion; and thus, through whatever arc the earth rotates from west to\r\neast, through the same arc will the plane of swing of the pendulum\r\nappear to travel from east to west under a b.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot set up a pendulum to swing at the pole of the earth. Let\r\nus inquire, then, whether the experiment ought to have similar results\r\nif carried out elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSuppose A B to be our pendulum-bearing rod, placed (for convenience of\r\ndescription merely) in a north and south position. Then it is clear that\r\nA B produced meets the polar axis produced (in E, suppose), and when,\r\nowing to the earth's rotation, the rod has been carried to the position\r\nA' B', it still passes through the point E. Hence it has shifted through\r\nthe angle A E A', a motion which corresponds to the case of the motion\r\nof A B (in Fig. 1) about the point E,[1] and the plane of the pendulum's\r\nswing will therefore show a displacement equal to the angle A E A'. It\r\nwill be at once seen that for a given arc of rotation the displacement\r\nis smaller in this case than in the former, since the angle A E A' is\r\nobviously less than the angle A K A'.[2] In our latitude a free pendulum\r\nshould seem to shift through one degree in about five minutes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In reality A E moves to the position A' E over the surface\r\nof a cone having E P' as axis, and E as vertex; but for any small part\r\nof its motion, the effect is the same as though it traveled in a plane\r\nthrough E, touching this cone; and the sum of the effects should clearly\r\nbe proportioned to the sum of the angular displacements.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In fact, the former angle is less than the latter, in the\r\nsame proportion that A K is less than A E, or in the proportion of the\r\nsine of the angle A E P, which is obviously the same as the sine of the\r\nlatitude.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that a great deal depends on the mode of suspension. What\r\nis needed is that the pendulum should be as little affected as possible\r\nby its connection with the rotating earth. It will surprise many,\r\nperhaps, to learn that in Foucault's original mode of suspension the\r\nupper end of the wire bearing the pendulum bob was fastened to a metal\r\nplate by means of a screw. It might be supposed that the torsion of\r\nthe wire would appreciably affect the result. In reality, however, the\r\ntorsion was very small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nStill, other modes of suspension are obviously suggested by the\r\nrequirements of the problem. Hansen made use of the mode of suspension\r\nexhibited in Fig. 3. Mr. Worms, in a series of experiments carried out\r\nat King's College, London, adopted a somewhat similar arrangement, but\r\nin place of the hemispherical segment he employed a conoid, as shown in\r\nFig. 4, and a socket was provided in which the conoid could work freely.\r\nFrom some experiments I made myself a score of years ago, I am inclined\r\nto prefer a plane surface for the conoid to work upon. Care must be\r\ntaken that the first swing of the pendulum may take place truly in one\r\nplane. The mode of liberation is also a matter of importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.3.]\r\n\r\nMany interesting experiments have been made upon the motions of a\r\nfree pendulum, regarded as a proof of the earth's rotation, and when\r\ncarefully conducted, the experiments have never failed to afford the\r\nmost satisfactory results. Space, however, will only permit me to dwell\r\non a single series of experiments. I select those made by Mr. Worms in\r\nthe Hall of King's College, London, in the year 1859:\r\n\r\n\"The bob was a truly turned ball of brass weighing 40 lb.; the\r\nsuspending medium was a thick steel wire; the length of the pendulum was\r\n17 feet 9 inches. The amplitude of the first oscillation was 6° 42', and\r\nduring the time of the experiment--about half an hour--the arcs were\r\nnot much diminished. As I had to demonstrate to a large number of\r\nspectators, I encountered considerable difficulty,\" says Mr. Worms, \"in\r\nrendering the small deviations of the plane of oscillation visible to\r\nall. I accomplished it in three different ways.\" These he proceeds\r\nto describe. He had first a set of small cones set up, which were\r\nsuccessively knocked down as the change in the plane of the pendulum\r\nslowly brought the pointer under the bob to bear on cone after cone.\r\nSecondly, a small cannon was so placed that the first touch of the\r\npendulum pointer against a platinum wire across the touch-hole completed\r\na galvanic circuit, and so fired the cannon. Lastly, a candle was placed\r\nso as to throw the shadow of the pendulum bob upon a ground-glass\r\nscreen, and so to exhibit the gradual change of the plane of swing.\r\n\r\nThe results accorded most satisfactorily with the deductions from the\r\ntheory of the earth's rotation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.4.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW LUNARIAN.\r\n\r\nBy Prof. C. W. MACCORD, Sc.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe construction of apparatus for illustrating the motions of the\r\nheavenly bodies has often occupied the attention of both mathematicians\r\nand mechanicians, who have produced many very ingenious, and in some\r\ncases very complicated, combinations. These may be divided into two\r\nclasses; the object of the first being to represent _exactly_ what\r\noccurs--to reproduce the precise movements of the various bodies\r\nrepresented in their true proportions and relations to each other, in\r\nrespect to distances, magnitudes, times, and phases. When the absolute\r\ncomplexity of the movements of the bodies composing the solar system\r\nis considered, it is not so much a matter of wonder that a planetarium\r\nwhich shall thus imitate them is a very delicate and complicated machine\r\nas that it should lie within the limits of human ingenuity.\r\n\r\nIn the second class, the object is to show the nature and the causes\r\nof specific phenomena, without regard to others perhaps, and without\r\nnecessarily paying attention to exact proportions of distances and\r\ndimensions. Indeed, it is often the case that the illustration is made\r\nclearer by exaggerating some of these and reducing others; thus, for\r\nexample, the causes of the variation in the lengths of the days and\r\nnights, and of the changes in the seasons, can be exhibited to much\r\nbetter advantage by an apparatus in which the diameter of the sun and\r\nits distance from the earth are enormously reduced than they possibly\r\ncould be were they of their proper proportionate magnitudes; nor is the\r\npresence of any other planet, or the attendance of a satellite, at all\r\nnecessary or even desirable for the purpose named.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that machines of this class can be made much more simple\r\nthan those of the first, while at the same time it may safely be\r\nasserted that for educational purposes they are far more useful.\r\n\r\nIn both classes, the action involves the use of some sort of epicyclic\r\ntrain, since the motions to be explained are both orbital and axial. The\r\nplanetary body is carried round by a train-arm, and its rotation about\r\nits axis is usually given it by a train of gearing, the inner or\r\ncentral wheel of which is stationary, being fastened to the fixed frame\r\nsupporting the whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN IMPROVED LUNARIAN.]\r\n\r\nThe lunarian which we herewith present belongs to the second of the\r\nclasses above named; in its construction an attempt has been made to\r\nshow by as simple means and in as clear a manner as possible the nature\r\nof the following phenomena, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. Apogee and perigee.\r\n\r\n2. The moon's phases.\r\n\r\n3. The rotation on her axis, by reason of which she always presents\r\nnearly the same face to the earth.\r\n\r\n4. The inclination of her axis to the plane of her orbit, and her\r\nconsequent libration in latitude.\r\n\r\n5. Her varying angular velocity, and consequent libration in longitude.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism consists of a train-arm, T, which turns upon the vertical\r\npivot, P, fixed in the stand. In this arm, T, are the bearings of two\r\ncranks, B and C. equal in length to each other and to a third crank, A,\r\nwhich is stationary, being fixed to the pivot, P, by a pin, p. To the\r\ncrank-pin of A is secured a reverted arm, A', which supports the earth,\r\nE, and keeps it also stationary. The three cranks are connected by the\r\nrod, R, like the parallel rod of a locomotive: to which is fastened by a\r\nsteady-pin, o, the bevel wheel, D, concentric with the crank-pin, b. The\r\nhead of this crank-pin is first made spherical, then faced off at an\r\nangle with the axis of b, and in the sloping face is firmly fixed the\r\nlong screw, S, forming the support for the moon, M, which is caused\r\nto rotate about the axis of S, by means of the wheel, F, equal to\r\nand engaging with D. The upper end of S projects slightly through a\r\nperforation in the moon, and to it the hemispherical black shell or cap,\r\nG, is fixed by the screw, K; this cap represents the unilluminated part\r\nof the moon, and since G, s, b, and B, are in effect but one piece, the\r\ncap moves precisely as the crank does.\r\n\r\nNow as the train-arm, T, is carried round, the cranks, B and C, will\r\nturn in their bearings; but by their connection with A, they are\r\ncompelled to remain always parallel to themselves, and thus the axis of\r\nthe moon receives a motion of translation. But since during this action\r\nthe wheel D turns relatively to the pin b, the moon evidently rotates\r\nabout its axis with an angular velocity precisely equal to that of its\r\norbital motion.\r\n\r\nThe black shell however has the motion of translation only, and thus\r\nexhibits the phases of the moon, on the supposition that the source\r\nof light is infinitely remote and the rays come always in the same\r\ndirection, which is not strictly true, of course; but the reasons of the\r\nvarying appearance are as clearly shown as if it were absolutely exact.\r\nThe same may be said in regard to the phenomena of libration; the\r\ninclination of the moon's axis to the plane of her orbit is really\r\nsmall, but is purposely exaggerated in this apparatus in order to make\r\nthe results apparent; in the position represented, it is quite obvious\r\nthat an observer upon the earth can see a little past one pole, and\r\ncannot quite see the other, as well as that this condition will be\r\nreversed after half a revolution.\r\n\r\nThe action in reference to the phases is clearly shown in the small\r\ndiagram on the right. The one on the left illustrates the manner in\r\nwhich the libration in longitude is made apparent. It will be noted that\r\nthe center of M is not directly over the axis of the bearing of the\r\ncrank, B, so that after half a revolution the moon will be farther from\r\nthe earth than she is here shown. Her orbit here is circular, whereas,\r\nin fact, it is an ellipse; but the earth not being in the center, her\r\nangular velocity in relation to the earth is variable, the result\r\nof which is that, when she is near her quadrature, the actual force\r\npresented to the earth is slightly different from that presented when in\r\nconjunction or opposition.\r\n\r\nThus these various peculiarities of the motion of our satellite are\r\nexhibited by comparatively simple means--the number of moving parts\r\nbeing, it is believed, as small as it can be made; and the substitution\r\nof a crank motion for the usual train of wheels, we think, is a new\r\ndevice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UPRIGHT ATTITUDE OF MANKIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one must have heard or have read of the supposed perfect\r\nadaptation of the human frame to bipedal locomotion and to an upright\r\nattitude, as well as the advantages which we gain by this erect\r\nposition. We are told, and with perfect truth, that in man the occipital\r\nforamen--the aperture through which the brain is connected with the\r\nspinal cord--is so placed that the head is nearly in equilibrium when he\r\nstands upright. In other mammalia this aperture lies further back, and\r\ntakes a more oblique direction, so that the head is thrown forward,\r\nand requires to be upheld partly by muscular effort and partly by the\r\nligamentum nuchæ, popularly known in cattle as the \"pax-wax.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, the relative lengths of the bones of the hinder extremities in\r\nman form an obstacle to his walking on all-fours. If we keep the legs\r\nstraight we may touch the ground in front of our feet with the tips of\r\nthe fingers, but we cannot place the palms of the hands upon the ground\r\nand use them to support any part of our weight in walking. Not a few\r\nother points of a similar tendency have been so often enlarged upon, in\r\nworks of a teleological character, that there can be no need even to\r\nspecify them at present.\r\n\r\nBut till lately it has never been asked, \"Is man's adaptation to\r\nan upright posture perfect?\" and \"Is this posture attended with no\r\ndrawbacks?\" These questions have been raised by Dr. S. V. Clevenger in a\r\nlecture delivered before the Chicago University Club, on April 18, 1882,\r\nand recently published in the _American Naturalist_. This lecture,\r\nwe may add, cost the speaker the chair of Comparative Anatomy and\r\nPhysiology at the Chicago University!\r\n\r\nDr. Clevenger first discusses the position of the valves in the veins.\r\nThe teleologists have long told us that the valves in the veins of\r\nthe arms and legs assist in the return of blood to the heart against\r\ngravitation. But what earthly use has a man for valves in the\r\nintercostal veins which carry blood almost horizontally backward to the\r\nazygos veins? When recumbent, these valves are an actual obstacle to\r\nthe free flow of the blood. The inferior thyroid veins which drop their\r\nblood into the innominate are obstructed by valves at their junction.\r\nTwo pairs of valves are situate in the external jugular, and another\r\npair in the internal jugular, but they do not prevent regurgitation of\r\nblood upward.\r\n\r\nAn anomaly exists in the absence of valves from parts where they are\r\nmost needed, such as the venæ cavæ, the spinal, iliac, hæmorrhoidal, and\r\nportal veins.\r\n\r\nBut if we place man upon all-fours these anomalies disappear, and a law\r\nis found regulating the presence or absence of valves, and, according to\r\nDr. Clevenger, it is applicable to all quadrupeds and to the so-called\r\nQuadrumana. Veins flowing toward the back, i.e., against gravitation in\r\nthe all-fours posture--are fitted with valves; those flowing in\r\nother directions are without. For the few exceptions a very feasible\r\nexplanation is given.\r\n\r\nValves in the hæmorrhoidal veins would be useless to quadrupeds; but to\r\nman, in his upright position, they would be very valuable. \"To their\r\nabsence in man many a life has been and will be sacrificed, to say\r\nnothing of the discomfort and distress occasioned by the engorgement\r\nknown as piles, which the presence of valves in their veins would\r\nobviate.\"\r\n\r\nA noticeable departure from the rule obtaining in the vascular system of\r\nmammalia also occurs to the exposed situation of the femoral artery in\r\nman. The arteries lie deeper than the veins, or are otherwise protected,\r\nfor the purpose--as a teleologist would say--of preventing serious loss\r\nof blood from superficial cuts. Translating this view into evolutionary\r\nlanguage, it appears that only animals with deeply placed arteries can\r\nsurvive and transmit their structural peculiarities to their offspring.\r\nThe ordinary abrasions to which all animals are exposed, not to mention\r\ntheir onslaughts upon each other, would quickly kill off species with\r\nsuperficially placed arteries. But when man assumed the upright posture\r\nthe femoral artery, which in the quadrupedal position is placed out of\r\nreach on the inner part of the thigh, became exposed. Were not this\r\ndefect greatly compensated by man's ability to protect this part in ways\r\nnot open to brutes, he, too, might have become extinct. As it is, this\r\nexposure of so large an artery is a fruitful cause of trouble and death.\r\n\r\nWe may here mention some other disadvantages of the upright position\r\nwhich Dr. Clevenger has omitted. Foremost comes the liability to fall\r\ndue to an erect posture supported upon two feet only. Four-footed\r\nanimals in their natural haunts are little liable to fall; if one foot\r\nslips or fails to find hold, the other three are available. If a fall\r\ndoes occur on level ground, there is very little danger to any mammal\r\nnearly approaching man in bulk and weight. Their vital parts, especially\r\nthe heart and the head, are ordinarily so near the ground that to them\r\nthe shock is comparatively slight. To human beings the effects of a\r\nfall on smooth, level ground are often serious, or even deadly. We need\r\nmerely call to mind the case of the illustrious physicist whom we have\r\nso recently and suddenly lost.\r\n\r\nThe upright attitude involves a further sourge of danger. In few parts\r\n(if any) of the body is a blow more fatal than over what is popularly\r\ncalled the \"pit of the stomach.\" In the quadruped this part is little\r\nexposed either to accidental or intentional injuries. In man it is quite\r\nopen to both. A blow, a kick, a fall among stones, etc., may thus easily\r\nprove fatal.\r\n\r\nAnother point is the exposure and prominence of the generative organs,\r\nwhich in most other animals are well protected. Leaving danger out of\r\nthe question, it may be asked whether we have not here the origin of\r\nclothing? The assumption of the upright posture may have made primitive\r\nman aware of his nakedness.\r\n\r\nReturning to the illustrations furnished by Dr. Clevenger, we are\r\nreminded that another disadvantage which occurs from the upright\r\nposition of man is his greater liability to inguinal hernia. In\r\nquadrupeds the main weight of the abdominal viscera is supported by the\r\nribs and by strong pectoral and abdominal muscles. The weakest part of\r\nthe latter group of muscles is in the region of Poupart's ligament,\r\nabove the groin. Inguinal hernia is rare in other vertebrates because\r\nthis weak part is relieved by the pressure of the viscera. In man the\r\npelvis receives almost the entire load of the intestines, and hence Art\r\nis called in to compensate the deficiencies of nature, and an immense\r\nnumber of trusses have to be manufactured and used. It is calculated\r\nthat 20 per cent. of the human family suffer in this way. Strangulated\r\nhernia frequently causes death. The liability to femoral hernia is in\r\nlike manner increased by the upright position.\r\n\r\nNow, if man has always been erect from his creation--or, if that term be\r\ndisliked, from his origin--we have evidently nothing to hope from the\r\nfuture in the way of an amendment of this and other defects. But if we\r\nhave sprung from a quadrupedal animal, and have by degrees adopted\r\nan upright position, to which we are as yet imperfectly adapted, the\r\nmuscular tissues of the abdomen will doubtless in the lapse of ages\r\nbecome strengthened to meet the demand made upon them, so that the\r\nliability to rupture will decrease. In like manner the other defects\r\nabove enumerated may gradually be rendered less serious.\r\n\r\nA most important point remains; the peritoneal ligaments of the uterus\r\nfully subserve suspensory functions. The anterior, posterior, and\r\nlateral ligaments are mainly concerned in preventing the gravid uterus,\r\nin quadrupeds, from pitching too far forward toward the diaphragm. The\r\nround ligaments are utterly unmeaning in the human female, but in the\r\nlower animals they serve the same purpose as the other ligaments.\r\nProlapsus uteri, from the erect position and the absence of supports\r\nadapted to the position, is thus rendered common, destroying the health\r\nand happiness of multitudes.\r\n\r\nAs a simple deduction from mechanical laws, it would readily follow that\r\nany animal or race of men which had for the longest time maintained an\r\nerect position would have straighter abdomens, wider pelvic brims with\r\ncontracted pelvic outlets, and that the weight of the spinal column\r\nwould force the sacrum lower down. This, generally speaking, we find to\r\nbe the case. In quadrupeds the box-shaped pelvis, which admits of easy\r\nparturition, is prevalent. Where the position of the animal is such as\r\nto throw the weight of the viscera into the pelvis, the brim necessarily\r\nwidens, these weighty organs sink lower, and the beads of the\r\nthigh-bones acting as fulcra permit the crest of the ilium to be\r\ncarried outward, while the lower part of the pelvis is at the same time\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\nIn the innominate bones of a young child the box-shape exists, while its\r\nprominent abdomen resembles that of the gorilla. The gibbon exhibits\r\nthis iliac expansion through the sitting posture which developed his\r\nischial callosities. Similarly iliac expansion occurs in the chimpanzee.\r\nThe megatherium had wide iliacal expansions due to its semi-erect\r\nhabits; but as its weight was in great part supported by the huge tail,\r\nand as the fermora rested in acetabula placed far forward, the leverage\r\nnecessary to contract the lower portion of the pelvis was absent.\r\n\r\nProf. Weber, of Bonn, quoted in Karl Vogt's \"Vorlesungen ueber den\r\nMensohen,\" distinguishes four chief forms of the pelvis in mankind--the\r\noval in Aryans, the round among the Red Indians, the square in the\r\nMongols, and the wedge-shaped in the Negro. Examining this question\r\nmechanically it would seem that the longer a race had remained in\r\nan upright position the lower is the sacrum, and the greater is the\r\ntendency to approximate to the larger lateral diameter of the European\r\nfemale. The front to back diameter of the ape's pelvis is usually\r\ngreater than the measurement from side to side. A similar condition\r\naffords the cuneiform, from which it may be inferred that the erect\r\nposition in the Negro has not been maintained so long as in the Mongol,\r\nwhose pelvis has assumed the quadrilateral shape owing to persistence\r\nof spinal axis weight for a greater time. This pressure has finally\r\nculminated in forcing the sacrum of the European nearer the pubes, with\r\nconsequent lateral expansion and contraction of the diameter from\r\nfront to back. From the marsupials to the lemurs the box-shaped pelvis\r\nremains. With the wedge-shape occasioned in the lowest human types there\r\noccurs a further remarkable phenomenon in the increased size of the\r\nfoetal head accompanying the contraction of the pelvic outlet. While the\r\nmarsupial head is about one-sixth the size of the narrowest part of the\r\nbony parturient canal, the moment we pass to erect animals the greater\r\nrelative increase is there seen in cranial size, with a coexisting\r\ndecrease in the area of the outlet. This altered condition of things\r\nhas caused the death of millions of otherwise perfectly healthy and\r\nwell-formed human mothers and children. The palæontologist might tell us\r\nif some such case of ischial approximation by natural mechanical causes\r\nhas not caused the probable extinction of whole genera of vertebrates.\r\n\"If we are to believe that for our original sin the pangs and labor\r\nof childbirth were increased, and if we also believe in the\r\ndisproportionate contraction of the pelvic space being an efficient\r\ncause of the same difficulties of parturition, the logical inference is\r\nthat man's original sin consisted in his getting upon his hind legs.\"\r\n\r\nThis subject is not without direct applications. Accoucheurs cause their\r\npatients to assume what is called the knee-chest position, a prone one,\r\nfor the purpose of restoring the uterus to something near a natural\r\nposition. Brown-Sequard recommends, in myelitis, or spinal congestion,\r\ndrawing away the blood from the spine by placing the patient on his\r\nabdomen or side, with hands and feet somewhat hanging down. The\r\nliability to _spina bifida_ is greatest in the human infant, through\r\nthe stress thrown on the spine. The easy parturition in the lower human\r\nraces is due to the discrepancy between cranial and pelvic sizes not\r\nhaving been as yet reached by those races. The Sandwich Island mother\r\nhas a difficult delivery only when her child is half white, and has\r\nconsequently a longer head than the unmixed native strain.\r\n\r\nAt present the world goes on in its blindness, apparently satisfied\r\nthat everything is all right because its exists, ignorant of the evil\r\nconsequences of apparently beneficial pecularities, vaunting man's\r\nerectness and its advantages, while ignoring the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe observation that the lower the animal the more prolific (not\r\nuniversally true!) would warrant the belief that the higher the animal\r\nthe more difficulties encompass its propagation and development. The\r\ncranio-pelvic difficulty may perhaps settle the Malthusian question as\r\nfar as the higher races of men are concerned by their extinction.\r\n\r\n[If the facts brought forward by Dr. Clevenger cannot be controverted,\r\nthey seem to prove that man must have originated by gradual development\r\nfrom a four-footed being. Had he been created an erect, bipedal animal,\r\nas we find him, his structure would have been not in partial, but in\r\nperfect, adaptation to the conditions of that attitude. That some of the\r\npeculiarities of his structure are better in harmony with a horizontal\r\nthan a vertical position of the spinal column, is perhaps the strongest\r\nargument against the theory of direct creation and the radical _toto\r\ncoelo_ distinction between man and beast that has yet been advanced. We\r\ncannot at the moment lay our hands upon any thorough and trustworthy\r\naccount of the valves in the veins of the sloth: as that animal spends\r\nits life hanging, back downward, the structure of the veins would be\r\ninteresting in this connection.--ED.

Let us now examine our enemies, for they are numerous.\r\nEverywhere frequent--in the air, in the earth, in the water--they only\r\nawait an occasion to introduce themselves into our body in order to\r\nengage in a contest for existence with the cells that make up our\r\ntissues; and, often victorious, they cause death with fearful rapidity.\r\nWhen we have named charbon, septicæmia, diphtheria, typhoid fever, pork\r\nmeasles, etc., we shall have indicated the serious affections that\r\nmicrobes are capable of engendering in the animal organism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: SUPPLEMENT, No. 446, page 7125.]\r\n\r\nWe call those diseases \"parasitic\" that are occasioned by the\r\nintroduction of a living organism into the bodies of animals. Although a\r\nknowledge of such diseases is easy where it concerns parasites such as\r\nacari and worms, it becomes very difficult when it is a question of\r\ndiseases that are caused by the Bacteriaceæ. In fact, the germs of these\r\nplants exist in the air in large quantities, as is shown by the analysis\r\nof pure air by a sunbeam, and we are obliged to take minute precautions\r\nto prevent then from invading organic substances. If, then, during an\r\nautopsy of an individual or animal, a microscopic examination reveals\r\nthe presence of microbes, we cannot affirm that the latter were the\r\ncause of the affection that it is desired to study, since they might\r\nhave introduced themselves during the manipulation, and by reason of\r\ntheir rapid vegetation have invaded the tissues of the dead animal in\r\na very short time. The presumption exists, nevertheless, that when\r\nthe same form of bacteria is present in the same tissue with the same\r\naffection, it is connected with the disease. This was what Davaine was\r\nthe first to show with regard to _Bacillus anthracis_, which causes\r\ncharbon. He, in 1850, having examined the blood of an animal that had\r\ndied of this disease, found therein amid the globules (Fig. 1), small,\r\nimmovable, very narrow rods of a length double that of the blood\r\ncorpuscles. It was not till 1863 that he suspected the active role of\r\nthese organisms in the charbon malady, and endeavored to demonstrate it\r\nby experiments in inoculation. Is the presence of these little rods in\r\nthe blood of an animal that has died of charbon sufficient of itself to\r\ndemonstrate the parasitic nature of the affection? No; in order that\r\nthe demonstration shall be complete, the bacteria must be isolated,\r\ncultivated in a state of purity in proper liquids, and then be used\r\nto inoculate animals with. If the latter die with all the symptoms\r\nof charbon, the demonstration will be complete. Davaine did, indeed,\r\nperform some experiments in inoculation that were successful, but his\r\nresults were contradicted by the experiments of Messrs. Jaillard and\r\nLeplat, and those of Mr. Bert concerning the toxic influence of oxygen\r\nat high tension upon microbes. As Davaine was unable to explain the\r\ncontradiction between his results and those of Messrs. Jaillard, Leplat,\r\nand Bert, minds were not as yet convinced, notwithstanding the support\r\nthat his ideas received from Mr. Koch's researches.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Mr. Pasteur took up Davaine's experiments, and confirmed his\r\naffirmations step by step by employing the method of culture that he had\r\nused with such success in his studies upon fermentation. He isolated\r\nDavaine's bacterium by cultivating it in a decoction of beer yeast that\r\nhad been previously sterilized (Fig. 2); and after from ten to twenty\r\ncultures, he found that a portion of the liquid containing a few\r\nbacteria, when used for inoculating a rabbit, quickly caused the latter\r\nto die of charbon, while the same liquid, when filtered through plaster\r\nor porcelain, became harmless.\r\n\r\nDavaine's bacterium develops exclusively in the blood, and is never\r\nfound at any depth in the tissues. This is due to the fact that the\r\nalga, having need of oxygen in order to live, borrows its flow from the\r\nblood, and thus extracts from the globules that which they should have\r\ncarried to the tissue. The animal therefore dies asphyxiated. It is on\r\naccount of the absence of oxygen in the blood that the latter assumes\r\nthe blackish-brown color that characterizes the malady, and that has\r\ngiven its name of _charbon_ (coal).\r\n\r\nThe parasitic nature of charbon was therefore absolutely demonstrated,\r\nfirst, by the constant presence of _Bacillus anthracis_ in the blood of\r\nanthracoid animals, and second, by the pure culture of the parasite and\r\nthe inoculation of animals with charbon by means of it.\r\n\r\nDavaine began the demonstration in 1863, and Pasteur finished it in\r\n1877. These facts are now incontestable; yet, to show how slowly truth\r\nis propagated, even in these days of telegraphs and telephones, there\r\nmight have been read a few months ago, in an interesting article on\r\nmicrobes, by Dr. Fol, a distinguished savant, the statement that charbon\r\nand tuberculosis were discovered by Dr. Koch!\r\n\r\nNew parasitic affections, whose existence was suspected, were soon\r\ndiscovered and scientifically demonstrated, such, for example, as\r\nsepticæmia, or the putrefaction which occurs in living animals, which in\r\nambulances causes so fearful havoc among the wounded, and which proceeds\r\nfrom _Bacillus septicus_. This parasite exhibits itself under the form\r\nof little articulated rods that live isolated from oxygen in the mass of\r\nthe tissues, and disorganize the latter in disengaging a large quantity\r\nof putrid gas. Other parasites of this class are the _micrococcus_ of\r\nchicken cholera (Fig. 3), the _micrococcus_ of hog measles, and the\r\n_Spirochoete Obermeieri_ of recurrent fever, discovered by Obermeier\r\n(Fig. 5).\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are a certain number of maladies that seem as if\r\nthey must be due to the Bacteriaceæ, although a demonstration of the\r\nfact by the method of cultures and inoculation has not as yet been\r\nattempted. Among such, we may cite typhoid fever, diphtheria, murrain,\r\ntuberculosis (Fig. 4), malarial fever (Fig. 6), etc.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, the list is already a long one, and it tends every day\r\nto still further increase. All the progress that has been made in so\r\nfew years in our knowledge of contagious or epidemic diseases is due\r\nexclusively to M. Pasteur and the scientific method that he introduced\r\nthrough his remarkable labors on fermentation. Now that we know our most\r\nformidable enemies, how shall we defend ourselves against them?\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, bacteria exist everywhere, mixed with the dust that\r\ninterferes with the transparency of the air and covers all objects; and\r\nthey are likewise found in water.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, our body is closed to these organisms through\r\nthe epidermis and epithelium, and, as has been shown by Mr. Pasteur, no\r\nbacteria are found in the blood and tissues of living animals. But let a\r\nrupture or wound occur, and bacteria will enter the body, and, when once\r\nthe enemy is in place, it will be too late. One sole chance of safety\r\nremains to us, and that is that in the warfare that it is raging against\r\nour tissues the enemy may succumb. M. Pasteur has shown that the blood\r\ncorpsucles sometimes engage in the contest against bacterides and\r\ncome off victorious. In fact, chickens are proof against poisoning by\r\ncharbon, because, owing to the high temperature of their blood, the\r\nbacterides are unable to extract oxygen from the corpuscles thereof.\r\nBut, if the chickens be chilled, the conditions are changed, and they\r\nwill die of charbon just as do cattle and sheep; but, as the result of\r\nthe contest cannot always be foreseen, it is necessary at any cost to\r\nprevent bacterides from entering the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I. Bacteria of charbon (_Bacillus antracis_.) II. The\r\nsame cultivated in yeast. III. The _Micrococcus_ of chicken cholera. IV.\r\nThe _Bacillus_ of tuberculosis. V. The _Spirillun_ of recurrent fever.\r\nVI. The _Bacillus_ of malaria.]\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances a severe hygiene will suffice to preserve\r\nus; if a wound is received it should be washed with water mixed with\r\nantiseptics, such as phenic acid, borax, or salicylic acid. If water is\r\nimpure, it must be boiled and then aerated before it is drunk. If the\r\nair is the vehicle of the germs of the disease, it will have to be\r\nfiltered by means of a muslin curtain kept wet with a hygroscopic\r\nsolution, glycerine for example. Finally, when, after an epidemic,\r\ncontaminated apartments are to be occupied, the walls and floor and the\r\nclothing must be washed with antiseptic solutions whose nature will vary\r\naccording to circumstances--steam charged with phenic acid, water mixed\r\nwith a millionth part of sulphuric acid, boric acid, ozone, chlorine,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThese preventives only prove efficient on condition that they be used\r\npersistently. Let our vigilance be lacking for an instant, and the enemy\r\nwill enter to work destruction, for it only requires a spore less than\r\na hundredth of a millimeter in diameter to produce the most serious\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nFortunately, and it is again to Mr. Pasteur that we owe these wonderful\r\ndiscoveries, the parasitic microbes themselves, which sow sickness and\r\ndeath, may, through proper culture, become true vaccine viri that are\r\ncapable of preserving the organism against any future attack of the\r\ndisease that they were capable of producing; such vaccine matters have\r\nbeen discovered for charbon, chicken cholera, the measles of swine, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the _micrococcus_ of chicken cholera (Fig. 3.) is cultivated, it\r\nis seen that the activity of the microbe in cultures exposed to the air\r\ngradually diminishes. While a drop of the liquid would, in twenty-four\r\nhours, have killed all the chickens that were inoculated with it, its\r\neffect after two, three, or four days considerably diminishes, and an\r\ninoculation with it produces nothing more than a slight indisposition in\r\nthe animal, and one that is never followed by a serious accident. It is\r\nthen said that the virulence of the microbe is attenuated.\r\n\r\nThe air is the agent of this transformation that gradually renders the\r\nbacteria benign, for in cultures made under the same circumstances as\r\nthe preceding, but with the absence of air, the activity of these algæ\r\nis preserved for days or weeks, and they will then cause death just as\r\nsurely as they would have done at the end of one day.\r\n\r\nWhat is remarkable is that animals inoculated with the attenuated\r\n_micrococcus_ become for a varying length of time refractory to the\r\naction of the most formidable parasites of this kind. Mr. Pasteur has\r\ndiscovered two such vaccine viri--one for chicken cholera and the other\r\nfor charbon. His results have not been accepted without a struggle, and\r\nit required nothing less than public experiment in vaccination, both in\r\nFrance and abroad, to convince the incredulous. There are still people\r\nat the present time who assert that Mr. Pasteur's process of vaccination\r\nhas not a great practical range! And yet, here we have the results; more\r\nthan 400,000 animals have been vaccinated since 1881, and it has been\r\nfound that the mortality is ten times less in these than in those that\r\nhave not been vaccinated!\r\n\r\nAn impetus has now been given, and we can look to the future with\r\nconfidence, for, if our enemies are numerous, the use of a severe\r\nhygiene and preventive vaccination will permit us to gradually free\r\nhumanity from the terrible scourges that sap the sources of fortune and\r\nlife.--_Science et Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINE FLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting of the New York Microscopical Society, a paper\r\nwas read by Dr. Samuel Lockwood, secretary of the New Jersey State\r\nMicroscopical Society. His subject was the Wine Fly, _Drosophila\r\nampelophila_. The paper was a contribution to the life-history of this\r\nminute insect. He had given in part three years to its study, beginning\r\nin September, 1881, when nothing whatever of its life-history seemed to\r\nhave been known. In October the flies attacked his Concords. He found\r\nupon a grape which he was inspecting with a pocket-lens an extremely\r\nsmall white egg; but lost it. The grapes when brought on the table were\r\ninfested by the flies, which proved to be the above mentioned species.\r\nWhen driven from the grapes they would fly to the window, where he\r\ncaptured two of them These were placed in a jar with a grape for food.\r\nIn two days he found one egg on the outer skin of the grape. The laying\r\nwas kept up for four or five days, until there were about thirty, some\r\non the outside of the grape and some at an opening where the two flies\r\nhad fed. The egg had a pair of curious suspenders near the end where\r\nthe mouth of the larva would develop. These suspenders were attached at\r\ntheir ends to the grape, but where the egg was laid in the soft part of\r\nthe fruit the suspenders were spread out at the surface; thus the larva\r\nwould emerge clean from the shell. The egg was 0.5 mm. in length, and\r\nabout a fourth of that in width. The larva when grown was at least four\r\ntimes as long as the egg. As the larva burrowed in the juices of the\r\nfruit, two quite prominent breathing tubes at the posterior end were\r\nkept in the air. Between these cardinal tubes were several teat-like\r\npoints, much smaller, but having a similar function.\r\n\r\nThe larvae appeared in five days after the eggs were laid. In about as\r\nmany more days the puparium state would be entered, and in about six\r\ndays more the fly or imago would appear. In ovipositing the suspensors\r\nwould leave the oviparous duct last. The paper claimed that the curious\r\nshape of the egg compelled the female to oviposit slowly, as it took\r\ntime for the egg to assume its form; hence, the eggs were not laid in\r\nstrings or masses, but singly and at considerable intervals.\r\n\r\nThe flies are very hairy, especially the females. The neck and even the\r\neyes are very hirsute. The eyes are red, quite large and pretty, though\r\nsomewhat _outre_ under the microscope, for from between the little\r\nlenses are projecting, straight, stiff hairs. As the insect is quite\r\nactive, it must be that this fringing of the tiny eyelets with hair does\r\nnot materially obscure its vision. When the minuteness of this singular\r\narrangement is considered, it is surely remarkable. This general\r\nhairiness of the female especially, and that about the head, neck, and\r\nforward part of the thorax, stands correlated to a beautiful structure\r\nfound only in the male, which has on the tarsus of each leg in the\r\nforward pair what the lecturer called a sexual comb. It is a beautiful\r\ncomb of a very dark brown color, each comb having ten pointed and strong\r\nteeth. In the nuptial embrace these combs are fixed in the hairy front\r\nof the thorax of the female, thus becoming little grapnels.\r\n\r\nThe flies love any vegetable substance in fermentation, whether acetic\r\nor vinous. Hence it will abound about cider mills, swarm on preserves in\r\nthe pantry, and in cellars or places where wine is being made or stored.\r\nThe paper showed the tendency of the glucose in the over-ripe grape\r\nto the vinous ferment, and that the fly delighted in it. A singular\r\naccident showed how they loved even the very high spirits. In making\r\nsome of the mounts shown to the society, Dr. Lockwood had left a bottle\r\nof 90 per cent. alcohol uncorked over night. Next morning he was\r\nastonished to find his alcohol of a beautiful amethystine color, and the\r\ncork out. Inspection showed a number of these tiny creatures, which,\r\nwhen filled with the purple juice of the grape, had smelt the alcohol\r\nin the open bottle, and had gone in to drink. They had ignominiously\r\nperished, and had given color to the liquid.--_Micro.

The apparatus\r\nwas designed to do away with certain sources of error in Sachs'\r\nolder form of the instrument, described in his \"Experimental\r\nPhysiologie\"--errors chiefly due to the continual alteration of pressure\r\nduring the progress of the experiment.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the diagram, the \"potetometer\" consists essentially of a\r\nglass tube, a d, open at both ends, and blown out into a bulb near the\r\nlower end; an aperture also exists on either side of the bulb at or\r\nabout its equator. The two ends of the main tube are governed by the\r\nstopcocks, a and d, and the greater length of the tube is graduated. A\r\nperforated caoutchouc stopper is fitted into one aparture of the bulb,\r\ne, and the tube, g k, fits hermetically to the other. This latter tube\r\nis dilated into a cup at h to receive the caoutchouc stopper, into which\r\nthe end of the shoot to be experimented upon is properly fixed.\r\n\r\nThe fixing of the shoot is effected by caoutchouc and wire or silk, as\r\nshown at i, and must be performed so that the clean-cut end of the\r\nshoot is exactly at the level of a tube passing through the perforated\r\nstopper, e, of the bulb; this is easily managed, and is provided for by\r\nthe bending of the tube, g h. The tube, f, passing horizontally through\r\nthe caoutchouc stopper, e, is intended to admit bubbles of air, and so\r\nequalize the pressure and at the same time afford a means of measuring\r\nthe rapidity of the absorption of water by the transpiring shoot. This\r\ntube (see Fig. 2, f) is a short piece of capillary glass tubing, to\r\nwhich is fixed a thin sheath of copper, b', which slides on it, and\r\nsupports a small plate of polished copper, a', in such a manner that the\r\nlatter can be held vertically at a small distance from the inner opening\r\nof the tube, and so regulate the size of the bubble of air to be\r\ndirected upward into the graduated tube, a b.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is filled by placing the lower end of the main tube under\r\nwater, closing the tubes, f and i (with caoutchouc tubing and clips),\r\nand opening the stopcocks, a and d. Water is then sucked in from a, and\r\nthe whole apparatus carefully filled. The cocks are then turned, and the\r\ncut end of the shoot fixed into i, as stated; care must be taken that no\r\nair remains under the cut end at i, and the end of the shoot must be at\r\nthe level, k l. This done, the tube, f, may then be opened.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the shoot transpire water, which is replaced through the\r\nstem at the cut end in i from the water in the apparatus. A bubble of\r\nair passes through the tube, f, and at once ascends into the graduated\r\ntube, a c. The descent of the water-level in this tube--which may\r\nconveniently be graduated to measure cubic millimeters--enables the\r\nexperimenter at once to read off the amount of water employed in a given\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell on obvious modifications of these\r\nessentials, nor to speak of the slight difficulties of manipulation\r\n(especially with the tube, f). Of course the apparatus might be mounted\r\nin several ways; and excellent results for demonstration in class could\r\nbe obtained by arranging the whole on one of the pans of a sensitive\r\nbalance.

The competition of India\r\nand Ceylon in supplying the markets has had also the effect of inducing\r\nmore care in collecting and also of revisiting old spots, often with the\r\nresult of a rich harvest of bark which had been left on partly denuded\r\ntrunks, and the opening up of new localities. The new shoots springing\r\nup from the old stumps have yielded much quill bark, and the root bark\r\nof the old stumps has also been utilized.\r\n\r\nThe replanting entails very little expense. The Indian tenant on an\r\nestate has a house and land from the owner (hacienda) of the estate. For\r\nthis he binds himself to work for two to four days a week, at from 28 to\r\n36 cents per day, women and children obtaining 16 to 21 cents per day.\r\nThus the planting, weeding, etc., during the first two years is\r\nbut nominal in expense; after this period the trees may be left to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOn Government land the expense is greater, as, after an application\r\nbeing made, the land is put up to public auction, and may fetch a\r\nvery low or higher price according to the bidding. The land secured,\r\ncontracts are made with natives of the lower class to clear the forest\r\nand plant cinchona. The contracts are often sublet to Indians. The\r\nyoung plants are planted from five to six feet apart, with banana trees\r\nbetween, on account of their rapid growth and the shade the latter\r\nafford. From March to June, after the wet season is over, is the best\r\ntime for planting, and the contractor keeps the plantation free from\r\nweeds and in good order for twelve months, when it is handed over to the\r\nowner. The following is given as the cost of the Mapiri River plantation\r\nof an area from 60 or more miles in extent:\r\n\r\n  Ground.                                   $1,200\r\n  300,000 plants at $0.14.                  42,000\r\n  Superintendent, buildings, etc.            4,400\r\n  Interest.                                  4,800\r\n                                           -------\r\n  Total.                                   $52,400\r\n\r\nTill the plants are above two years of age, they are liable to die from\r\ndrought or the attacks of ants, and during 1878 many thousands died from\r\nthese causes. At the end of the fourth year some proprietors begin to\r\ncollect the quill bark by the method of coppicing.\r\n\r\nIt is feared by some that, should this new venture be successful, it\r\nwill prove a dangerous rival to the plantations of India, Ceylon, and\r\nJava, and lower the price of bark considerably.--_Jour.

Davallioides Furcans._--Among the many crested ferns in cultivation,\r\nthis, of which the annexed is an illustration, is one of the most\r\ndistinct; so different indeed it is from the type, that it is\r\nquestionable if it really is a form of it; the most essential\r\ncharacteristic, that of the fructification at the extreme edge of the\r\nlobes of the pinnæ, is altogether absent, and the whole habit of the\r\nplant is also thoroughly distinct. It is of equally robust growth,\r\nbut its handsomely arching fronds, which are from 3 feet to 4 feet\r\nin length, are produced in great abundance from a central tuft or\r\nagglomeration of crowns. Its most distinct characteristic is the\r\nfurcation of the pinnæ, which are all of the same dimensions, whether\r\nsterile or fertile; they are all opposite and closely set along the\r\nmid-rib, whereas those of N. davallioides are set much further apart.\r\nIn the barren pinnæ which are only situated on the lower portion of the\r\nfrond, and which generally are only few in number, the furcation is\r\nrudimentary; in the fertile pinnæ it is twice and even three times\r\nrepeated in the extremities of the first division, becoming more complex\r\ntoward the point of the frond, where it often forms quite a large\r\ntassel, whose weight gives the fronds quite an elegant, arching habit.\r\nOn that account this plant is valuable for growing in baskets of large\r\ndimensions, in which it shows itself off to good advantage, and never\r\nfails to prove attractive. Although it produces spores freely, it is\r\nbest to propagate it by means of the young plants produced from rhizomes\r\nin the ordinary way, on account of the extreme variations which take\r\nplace among the seedlings, a small percentage only of which are\r\npossessed of the true character of the parent plant. Stove.--_The\r\nGarden._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEPHROLEPIS DAVALLIOIDES FURCANS.]\r\n\r\n_N. Duffi_.--This pretty, neat-habited species, of which an\r\nillustration, kindly lent us by Mr. Bull, appears in another place, is a\r\nnative of the Duke of York's Island, in the South Pacific Ocean, and is\r\nundoubtedly one of the most interesting of the whole genus. Its compact\r\nhabit, its comparatively small dimensions, and the bright, glossy color\r\nof its beautifully tasseled fronds render it a most welcome addition to\r\na group of ferns naturally rich in decorative plants. Its curiously and\r\nirregularly pinnate fronds are borne on slender stalks, terete toward\r\nthe base, and covered with reddish brown, downy scales, instead of being\r\nproduced loosely, as in most other Nephrolepises; these are densily\r\ncrowded, and the outcome of closely clustered crowns. They measure from\r\n15 inches to 18 inches long, and are terminated by very handsome massive\r\ncrests, which vary in size according to the temperature in which the\r\nplant is grown. We have at different times heard complaints of these\r\nfronds being simply furcate, when the same plant, after being subjected\r\nto a greater amount of heat and moisture, produced fronds very heavily\r\ntasseled, and partaking of an elegant vase-shaped appearance. In fact,\r\nnothing short of the moist heat of a stove will induce it to show its\r\ncharacters in their best condition. The pinnæ, which are small, of\r\ndifferent sizes, rounded and serrated at the edges, are produced in\r\npairs, one overlying the other, and, curiously enough, those on the top\r\nare the largest. The pairs are sometimes opposite, but mostly alternate,\r\ndistant toward the base, approximate higher up, and crowded and\r\nquite overlapping in the crested portion of the frond. This, being\r\na thoroughly barren kind, can only be propagated by division of the\r\ncrowns, an operation easily done at any time of the year, but most\r\nsafely in early spring and by young plants produced from the rhizomes,\r\nwhich, however, are produced much more sparingly than in any other\r\nspecies. It is also one of the best adapted for pot or pan culture, its\r\nsomewhat upright habit making it less suitable for baskets, brackets,\r\nand wall covering than other species.

Aimé Girard before the Paris Academy of Sciences. By comparative\r\ninvestigations of the amount of cane sugar and grape sugar in different\r\nparts of the sugar-cane in the afternoon and before sunrise, the author\r\nhas found that only in the substance of the leaves does this quantity\r\nvary, and that the quantity of cane sugar sinks during the night to\r\none-half, while the quantity of reducing sugar remains almost unaltered.\r\nHe finds further that the quantity of sugar-cane in the leaves increases\r\nwith the illumination, on very bright days reaching nearly one per\r\ncent., considerably less on dull ones, and in either case diminishing\r\nduring the night by one-half. From this the author concludes that the\r\nformation of saccharose from glucose takes place entirely in the leaves\r\nunder the influence of sunlight, and that the saccharose thereupon\r\nascends the cane through the petioles, etc., and collects there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
