The information utilised by me in this book as far\r\nas the Upper Nile is concerned is obtained from Sir William’s Report;\r\nfor the Blue Nile and Atbara I am indebted to M. Dupuis’ interesting\r\nappendix at the end of Sir William’s Report; and for the river north of\r\nKhartum to my own studies and surveys. As Sir William employed Capt.\r\nH.G. Lyons, R.E. to collaborate with him, the references to the works of\r\nprevious writers and geographical details may be accepted without any\r\nmisgivings. To M. Chélu Bey, Director of the Government Press, I am\r\nindebted for his ever ready aid; to Mr. Hansard of the Survey Department\r\nfor the plates accompanying this work; and to Mr H.G.F. Beadnell, F.G.S,\r\nF.R.G.S, for having kindly written the description of the Egyptian oases\r\nand the geology of Egypt which form the fifth chapter of this book.\r\n\r\n  W.

The most interesting river of the\r\nancient world, it is still the most interesting river of our time; and,\r\nin spite of all that ancient and modern discoveries have unfolded, its\r\ndischarges are to-day more difficult to unravel and weave together than\r\nthose of any other stream in either hemisphere. These discharges are\r\nstill a mystery, and it will need years and years of patient observation\r\nand study, at the hands of the Sudan Irrigation Department, to enable us\r\nto state with exactitude why its floods rise and fall with such regular\r\nand stately precision, why they are never sudden and abrupt, and why its\r\nsummer supplies can never be completely cut off even in their traverse\r\nof over 3000 kilometres through the burning and parched Sahara. Though\r\nthe mystery of the Nile is far from being solved to-day, still an\r\nenormous step in advance has been made by the publication of Sir William\r\nGarstin’s Report on the Basin of the Upper Nile[2]. This Report not only\r\ncontains the results of three years’ observations of the Egyptian Survey\r\nDepartment in the Sudan, of Sir William Garstin’s own observations and\r\nstudies, but also a mass of information of the Nile and its tributaries\r\ncollected by Capt. H. G. Lyons. R. E., through four years of\r\nuninterrupted study. Those who know the intelligence and method with\r\nwhich Capt. Lyons works, will rate this information at its proper value.\r\n\r\n  [1] _Saggio idrolico sul Nilo_, by ELIA LOMBARDINI, Milan 1865.\r\n\r\n  [2] _Report on the Basin of the Upper Nile_ by SIR WILLIAM GARSTIN.\r\n  Blue Book Egypt (2) 1904.\r\n\r\nLombardini gathered together all the information available at the time\r\nthat Sir Samuel Baker announced the existence of the Albert Nyanza\r\nshortly after Speke and Grant had proclaimed to the world that the\r\nVictoria Nyanza was the true source of the Nile. From the information\r\nthen available he deduced the laws and operations of the great river.\r\nAbout twenty years later, just before the rebellion in the Sudan closed\r\nthe Nile to the civilized world, a German savant, Joseph Chavanne[3], in\r\nhis book on the rivers of Africa, collected and tabulated on clear and\r\nmethodical lines much of the information available in 1883. Though many\r\nof his facts are erroneous, his method is clear and his ideas just. Sir\r\nWilliam Garstin, in his Report, has developed the information at his\r\ndisposal on such practical lines as are needed to study the question of\r\ninsuring an abundant supply of water to the Nile in Egypt during the\r\ntimes of low supply.\r\n\r\n  [3] “_Afrikas Ströme und Flüsse_” by JOSEPH CHAVANNE. Wien 1883.\r\n\r\nHaving myself studied the Nile for fifteen years in order to solve the\r\nproblems of water storage and flood control on the Nile, and having\r\ndevoted the whole of my life to this very science of Hydraulics, I have\r\nbeen encouraged to attempt the continuation of Lombardini’s work; and,\r\nto the utmost of my ability, to bring it to the level of the knowledge\r\nof our day.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Nomenclature.=--The nomenclature of the tributaries of the Nile is\r\ndifficult to follow. In this book I shall call the river _the Victoria\r\nNile_ from Lake Victoria to Lake Albert; _the Albert Nile_ from Lake\r\nAlbert to the Sobat mouth (this reach is known generally as the Bahr el\r\nGebel); _the White Nile_ from the Sobat mouth to Khartoum; and _the\r\nNile_ from Khartoum to the sea. _The Blue Nile_ stretches from Lake\r\nTsana in Abyssinia to Khartoum.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Description of the course of the Nile.=--Chapters II and III contain\r\ndetailed descriptions of the Nile and its main tributaries, and this\r\nparagraph is a short epitome of what is written there about the course\r\nof the Nile. The Nile drains nearly the whole of north-eastern Africa,\r\nan area comprising 3 million square kilometres. Its main tributary, the\r\nWhite Nile, has its furthest sources in south latitude 4°, near Lake\r\nTanganyika. Known as the Kagera, it is one of the feeders of Lake\r\nVictoria, and has a course of 600 kilometres before it reaches the lake.\r\nLake Victoria, covering 60,000 square kilometres, is the first reservoir\r\nof the Nile. The Victoria Nile leaves Lake Victoria by the Ripon Falls\r\nand after a course of 400 kilometres enters Lake Albert at its northern\r\ncorner. At its southern end Lake Albert is fed by the Semliki river\r\nwhich has its sources in Lake Edward. Its own area is 4,500 square\r\nkilometres. The Albert Nile leaves Lake Albert at its northern end and\r\nhas a course of 1280 kilometres to the mouth of the Sobat river. Of this\r\nlength, the first 200 kilometres up to Dufile have scarcely any slope,\r\nthe next 150 kilometres are down a series of severe cataracts. From the\r\nfoot of these cataracts to its tail the Albert Nile has a gentle slope\r\nand traverses the Sudd region where the bed of the stream is often\r\nbarred by blocks of living vegetation. In this latter region the stream\r\ndivides into two, of which the right hand one is known as the Bahr\r\nZeraf. After a course of 270 kilometres the Bahr Zeraf joins the Albert\r\nNile again. In the interval the Albert Nile receives as a left-hand\r\nfeeder the Bahr Gazelle. The Sobat river has its sources in Gallaland\r\nand joins the Albert Nile at the termination of the Sudd region. From\r\nthe junction of the Albert Nile and the Sobat, the river is known as the\r\nWhite Nile, which, after a course of 840 kilometres, with an exceedingly\r\ngentle slope, joins the Blue Nile at Khartoum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\nTHE NILE\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.]\r\n\r\nThe Blue Nile is the true parent of the land of Egypt. The deposits of\r\nits muddy waters have made Egypt. The Atbara has added its quota, but\r\nthe Blue Nile is incomparably the chief contributor; fed by the timely\r\nand plentiful rains of southern and south-eastern Abyssinia, it\r\ncontributes 65 per cent of the waters which pass Assuân. The furthest\r\nsources are those of the Abai, which, after a course of 110 kilometres\r\nfalls into Lake Tsana. This lake has an area of 3,000 square kilometres\r\nand lies about 1,760 metres above sea level. The Blue Nile leaves it at\r\nits south-eastern corner and hurries down to the Sudan, fed by numerous\r\nAbyssinian rivers. At Rosaires, after a course of 750 kilometres, it has\r\nfallen 1,260 metres; and below the Rosaires cataract enters the plain\r\ncountry south of Khartoum. For its remaining 615 kilometres on to\r\nKhartoum, where it meets the White Nile, it is navigable for the greater\r\npart of the year. North of Sennaar it is fed by the Dinder and Rahad\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nBetween Khartoum and El Damer, on a length of 320 kilometres, the Nile\r\nhas its even passage broken by the 6th cataract at Shabluka. At El Damer\r\nthe Nile receives the Atbara as a right hand tributary.\r\n\r\nThe Atbara is a very muddy torrent fed by the rains of north-eastern\r\nAbyssinia. It runs for 4 months per annum and is dry for 8 months.\r\nRising within a few kilometres of Lake Tsana, it falls 1500 metres in\r\nits first 300 kilometres, and is then joined by the Salaama, and, 100\r\nkilometres lower down, by the Settit river. After the junction with the\r\nSettit, the Atbara flows for 480 kilometres and joins the Nile at El\r\nDamer, contributing a fair quantity of water and a very considerable\r\nquantity of Nile mud to the river.\r\n\r\nFrom the Atbara junction to the sea, the Nile has a course of 2,700\r\nkilometres. In its first length of 1480 kilometres to Assuân it\r\ntraverses the 5th and 4th cataracts between Berber and Dongola, the 3rd\r\nand 2nd cataracts between Dongola and Wady Halfa, and the 1st cataract\r\nat Assuân. All these cataracts are navigable in flood, but not so in\r\nsummer. From Assuân to the Barrage at the head of the Delta north of\r\nCairo, the Nile has a length of 970 kilometres and traverses Egypt\r\nwithout a cataract or interruption of any kind. At the Barrage, the Nile\r\ndivides into the Rosetta and Damietta branches, and after a further\r\ncourse of about 240 kilometres in either branch, flows into the\r\nMediterranean sea. Its greatest length from the sources of the Kagera\r\nriver to the sea is 6350 kilometres, constituting it one of the longest\r\nrivers in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =The Slopes and velocities of the Nile in its different\r\nreaches.=--Table 2 of Appendix B and Plate II comprise all the\r\ninformation available under this head which I have been able to collect.\r\nFor the slopes I have adopted the following data:\r\n\r\n  R. L. of Lake Victoria      1129 metres above mean sea\r\n     „     Fowera             1060   „          „\r\n     „     Lake Albert         680   „          „\r\n     „     Khartoum (flood)    389   „          „\r\n\r\nFrom Khartoum to Wady Halfa I have adopted the generally accepted levels\r\nof the original Soudan railway survey. From Wady Halfa to the sea I have\r\nlevelled myself. Upstream and downstream from the adopted levels I have\r\ncarried the levels by the aid of slopes calculated from velocity and\r\nhydraulic mean depth data. It seems to me absurd to adopt a level for\r\nLake Choga 50 metres above that for Fowera, and then to add, that in the\r\n140 kilometres between the two places the Victoria Nile has a gentle\r\nslope, wide bed and gentle velocity. By a strange fatality, this very\r\nerror has crept into the figures under Lake Choga on Plate II. The error\r\nis noted in the corrigenda attached to the Plate. The Section is drawn\r\ncorrectly but these wrong figures have been interpolated by an\r\noversight.\r\n\r\nThe Victoria Nile Falls 450 metres in 400 kilometres, but has four\r\nreaches; the first ¹⁄₁₂₀₀, the second ¹⁄₂₀₀₀₀, the third ¹⁄₁₈₀ past the\r\nMurchison Falls, and the fourth ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀.\r\n\r\nThe Albert Nile falls 277 metres in 1290 kilometres. The first reach\r\npast Wadelai has a slope of ¹⁄₂₅₀₀₀, the second over the Fola and\r\nfollowing cataracts has a slope of ¹⁄₇₀₀, the third ¹⁄₁₂₀₀₀, the fourth\r\n¹⁄₂₀₀₀₀, the fifth ¹⁄₂₅₀₀₀, and the last below lake No of ¹⁄₇₅₀₀₀ in\r\nflood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\n  ERRATUM.\r\n\r\n  Erase the two figures under Lake Choga in the “Height” column.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION OF THE NILE,\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE NILE, THE WHITE NILE, THE ALBERT NILE, THE VICTORIA NILE & THE\r\nSEMLIKI RIVER\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.]\r\n\r\nThe White Nile falls 14 metres in 840 kilometres and has two slopes in\r\nflood; ¹⁄₅₀₀₀₀ in its upper reach, and then ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Nile falls 1370 metres in 1370 kilometres, which may roughly be\r\ndivided into three reaches. The first from Lake Tsana to Rosaires on a\r\nlength of 750 kilometres ¹⁄₆₀₀, the second Rosaires to Sennaar ¹⁄₄₅₀₀,\r\nand the third ¹⁄₇₀₀₀. These are very approximate indeed.\r\n\r\nThe Atbara falls 1640 metres in 880 kilometres. In the first 300\r\nkilometres the slope is ¹⁄₂₀₀; in the next 300 kilometres the slope is\r\n¹⁄₂₅₀₀, and in the last reach of 280 kilometres it is ¹⁄₆₀₀₀. These are\r\napproximate.\r\n\r\nThe Main Nile from Khartoum to Assuan falls 295 metres in 1810\r\nkilometres; the so-called six cataracts occupy 565 kilometres with a\r\nslope of ¹⁄₃₀₀₀; and the ordinary channel occupies 1245 kilometres and\r\nhas a slope of ¹⁄₁₂₀₀₀. From Assuân to the Barrage, on a length of 970\r\nkilometres, the Nile falls 76 metres with a mean slope of ¹⁄₁₃₀₀₀. The\r\nRosetta and Damietta branches are each about 240 kilometres long and\r\nhave a slope in flood of ¹⁄₁₃₀₀₀, and of ¹⁄₁₂₅₀₀ in extraordinarily high\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nFrom the sources of the Kagera river to the sea, on a length of 6350\r\nkilometres, the Nile falls 2000 metres, or has a slope of ¹⁄₃₂₀₀. From\r\nLake Victoria to the sea the length is 5535 kilometres and the fall 1129\r\nmetres, or the slope is ¹⁄₅₀₀₀.\r\n\r\nTable III of Appendix C. gives the velocities of the river in flood and\r\nlow supply, in metres per second and kilometres per day, and also the\r\ntime occupied in traversing the different reaches. There are two breaks.\r\nThe first is at Lake Choga and the second is at Lake Albert. As the\r\nVictoria Nile traverses the eastern arm of the many-armed and peculiar\r\nLake Choga with a perceptible current, and as, moreover, the lake is\r\nvery shallow, we may give some figure to the velocity and make it half\r\nthat of the Bahr Gazelle which is ·20 metres per second and is\r\nconsidered perceptible. With a velocity of ·10 metres per second or 8\r\nkilometres per day, the 80 kilometres of the lake would be traversed in\r\n10 days. The time of traverse from Lake Victoria to Lake Albert would be\r\n15 days. With Lake Albert it is very different. A reference to Plate V\r\nwill show that it takes the Victoria Nile 5 months to fill up Lake\r\nAlbert before the Albert Nile can carry off the waters of the Victoria\r\nNile, gauge for gauge. Under these conditions it will be wise to stop at\r\nLake Albert and begin a new calculation from this lake.\r\n\r\nThe Albert Nile takes 22 days in flood and 25 days in low supply to\r\ntraverse the distance from Lake Albert to the Sobat mouth. The White\r\nNile takes 21 days in flood and 28 days in low supply to reach\r\nKhartoum. Consequently from Lake Albert to Khartoum we have 43 days in\r\nflood and 53 days in low supply.\r\n\r\nFrom Khartoum to Assuân the Nile takes 11 days in flood and 22 days in\r\nlow supply, and consequently from Lake Albert to Assuân we have 54 days\r\nin flood and 75 days in low supply.\r\n\r\nFrom Assuân to Cairo we have 6 days in flood and 12 days in low supply.\r\n\r\nTable III is very interesting and well worth study. Through the Sudd\r\nregion we have a velocity of ·6 metres per second, but only of ·35\r\nmetres per second in the White Nile. In Egypt the Nile in flood has a\r\nvelocity of 1·75 metres per second, and in low supply of ·85 metres per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Catchment basins of the Nile and its tributaries.=--Table I, of\r\nAppendix A gives the areas of the catchment basins of the Nile. The\r\ntotal area according to the table is 3,007,000 square kilometres. The\r\nlimits of the basin are depicted on Plate I, and, with rare exceptions,\r\nthey are now fairly well known everywhere. North of the 20th parallel of\r\nlatitude the watershed on the west of the Nile is not far removed from\r\nthe edge of the plateau skirting the Nile valley. The plateau falls away\r\nto the west, and occasional ravines find their way to the Nile down the\r\nreverse slope. On the east of the Nile the crest of the hills skirting\r\nthe Red sea is the watershed. South of the 20th parallel of latitude the\r\neastern watershed follows the crest of the hills on the west of the Red\r\nsea as far as Suakin. South of Suakin the watershed leaves the Red sea,\r\nto allow the Khor Barraka to flow into this sea. From the south east of\r\nKassala, round by Addis Ababa, the watershed follows the crest of the\r\nhigh hills forming the eastern backbone of Abyssinia, and dividing the\r\nwaters of the Nile from those flowing into the Indian Ocean. South west\r\nof Abyssinia the watershed travels in a south-westerly direction to the\r\neast of Gondokoro, and divides the Sobat from the rivers draining into\r\nLake Rudolf. The watershed then moves due south to the western\r\nescarpment east of Lake Victoria. Mounts Kenia and Kilmanjaro are not\r\nwithin the basin of the Nile. Sweeping in a rough curve round Lake\r\nVictoria and nearly touching Lake Tangangyika in 4° south latitude, the\r\nwatershed keeps close to the western shores of Lakes Edward and Albert\r\nto nearly opposite Wadelai. All the slopes of the Ruenzori mountains\r\ndrain into the Nile.\r\n\r\nFrom near Wadelai the watershed moves in a north-westerly direction\r\nalong the hills dividing the waters of the tributaries of the Gazelle\r\nriver from the Welle. Due west of the Sudd region the watershed has\r\nreached its most westerly position and from there turns northwards along\r\nthe Marrah hills in Darfur, dividing the scanty waters of the\r\nBahr-el-Arab and its tributaries from the rivers draining into Lake\r\nChad. From the Marrah hills the watershed travels in a north-easterly\r\ndirection to a point close to the Nile on the 20th parallel of latitude\r\nnear Hannek.\r\n\r\nOf the lands enclosed within this watershed, all that are drained\r\ndirectly into the Main Nile are desert. There are occasional showers,\r\nand some of the valleys and ravines carry water for a few hours every\r\nyear, others every second, third or fourth year, but they contribute\r\npractically nothing to the volume of the Nile. The rains generally come\r\nin the winter when the Nile is falling every day, and the steady fall of\r\nthe Nile is never arrested by the waters of any or all of these\r\nwatercourses. The country west of the White Nile past Kordofan and\r\nDarfur to the Marrah hills is steppe land producing scanty grasses and\r\nforests of low accacias in the south, and rising to a general height of\r\nabout 600 metres at the Marrah hills. The lands drained by the Gazelle\r\nriver and the Albert Nile north of Gondokoro are flat plains or swamps\r\nin the north and east, and wooded and broken ground in the west and\r\nsouth-west, where the tributaries of the Gazelle river rise in the Blue\r\nmountains at a general height of 1500 metres. The upper waters of the\r\nSobat and its tributaries drain the well wooded and cultivated mountain\r\nmasses of Gallaland and then traverse the marshes and flat lands which\r\nlie east of the Sudd region. The Blue Nile and its upper tributaries\r\ndrain the choicest portions of the high Abyssinian mountain plateau\r\nlying over 2000 metres above sea level, and rising in places to 2500\r\nmetres and upwards. The lower courses of the Blue Nile, the Rahad and\r\nthe Dinder are through the black cotton soil plains of the eastern\r\nSudan, which are either wooded or covered with dense grass in the south.\r\nThe Atbara and its tributaries in their upper courses drain the northern\r\nslopes of the Abyssinian plateau, and traverse the level plains of the\r\neastern Sudan in a direction parallel to the Blue Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Albert Nile and its tributaries between Gondokoro and Lake Albert\r\ntraverse the broken and hilly country which is cut through by the Albert\r\nNile at the Fola and succeeding rapids. The catchment basins of Lakes\r\nVictoria and Albert are the undulating hills, the flat marshy valleys,\r\nthe great lakes and, in parts, high hills which constitute the\r\nhighlands of Central Africa. The general level of the area may be taken\r\nas 1400 metres above sea level.\r\n\r\nThe area draining into Lake Victoria is 240,000 square kilometres. At\r\nthe outlet of Lake Albert this has increased to 380,000, and at\r\nGondokoro to 470,000. The Gazelle river drains 470,000 square\r\nkilometres, and the Sobat 160,000. The White Nile drains altogether\r\n1,690,000 square kilometres, or more than half the total area of the\r\ncatchment basin of the Nile. The Blue Nile drains 300,000 square\r\nkilometres and the Atbara 240,000. The Nile below the Atbara junction is\r\ndraining 2,290,000 square kilometres. Between the Atbara mouth and the\r\nsea, the Nile drains whatever falls on a desert area of 720,000 square\r\nkilometres.\r\n\r\nIf we take 3,000 cubic metres per second as the average annual flow past\r\nAssuân we may say that the White Nile supplies 24% off more than half\r\nthe area of the whole basin, the Blue Nile 65% off ¹⁄₁₀ the area, and\r\nthe Atbara 11% off ¹⁄₁₂ the area. The Gazelle river drains about ¹⁄₆ the\r\ntotal area and adds practically nothing to the discharge. Table 24\r\nshould be very carefully studied by any man who wants to understand the\r\nNile. It does not pretend to exactitude, but embodies the best\r\ninformation I have been able to obtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =The climate of the Nile valley.=--This paragraph would have been\r\nmuch more complete if Capt. Lyons’ monograph on the Meteorology of the\r\nNile valley had been published. In considering the climate I shall\r\nfollow the subdivisions of the catchment basin of the Nile contained in\r\nTable I.\r\n\r\nIn the catchment basins of Lakes Victoria and Albert, the mean annual\r\nrainfall may be taken as 1.25 metres, with great fluctuations between\r\ngood and bad years. Neglecting here and through this paragraph, the\r\nlight occasional falls of rain which are trying to travellers but which\r\nhave no effect on the rivers, it may be said that in these basins there\r\nare two rainy seasons, the greater in March, April and May, and the\r\nlesser in October, November and December. The former are followed by dry\r\nsouthern winds, while north winds blow in the winter.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole of the Albert Nile, the mean annual rainfall may be\r\ntaken as 1 metre, with severe famines in occasional years and heavy\r\nrainfall in others. The principal rains are between May and November,\r\nwith the maximum between August 15 and September 15. In years of\r\ndeficient rainfall, the June, July and August rains seem to fail. The\r\ncatchment basin of the Gazelle river may be credited with a mean annual\r\nrainfall of 75 centimetres between May and October, while the mean\r\nannual rainfall on the Arab river cannot be more than 30 centimetres\r\nbetween June and September. The Sobat river in its upper reaches enjoys\r\nan annual rainfall of about 1.25 metres and of ·75 metres in its lower\r\nreaches. The time of rain is between March and September. The lands\r\ndraining into the White Nile north of Tewfikieh have an annual rainfall\r\nof about 20 centimetres between June and September.\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinian part of the catchment basin of the Blue Nile enjoys a\r\ngood rainfall throughout nine months of the year from February to\r\nOctober, with generally heavy rain between May and September, and very\r\noccasionally in October. The rainfall here may be taken as 1.25 metres\r\nper annum. In the plains of the eastern Sudan traversed by the lower\r\nreaches of the Blue Nile and the Atbara the rainfall is very much\r\nlighter and may be considered as 30 centimetres between July and\r\nSeptember; fairly constant and heavier in the south, and very inconstant\r\nand lighter in the north. The Atbara and its tributaries in their upper\r\nreaches on the northern slopes of Abyssinia, have rain from May to the\r\nend of August and occasionally into September. There are great\r\nfluctuations in the rainfall. The mean annual rainfall may be taken as\r\n75 centimetres.\r\n\r\nThe desert area between Khartoum and Cairo has occasional winter rains\r\nespecially in the parts near the Red sea, but as these rains are nearly\r\nall soaked up by the desert, and very little, here and there, reaches\r\nthe Nile, we may neglect them altogether. Railways have to be provided\r\nwith culverts and bridges where they cross the terminal reaches of the\r\nkhors and wadis which run considerable bodies of water for a few hours\r\nafter rain; but the effect on the Nile is practically nothing. Along the\r\nsea-board of the Mediterranean there are a few inches of rain every\r\nwinter, sufficient as a rule to raise poor crops of barley.\r\n\r\nIn the catchment basins of Lakes Victoria and Albert the direction of\r\nthe winds may be taken as north-east in winter and south-east in summer.\r\nThe maximum monthly temperature may be taken as 35° and the minimum as\r\n12°, with a mean for the year of 21°.\r\n\r\nAlong the Albert Nile the north wind blows through the winter, and\r\nsoutherly winds prevail from about the 15th of April to October. The\r\ntemperature may be taken as ranging from a monthly maximum of 38° to a\r\nmonthly minimum of 16°, with a mean of 27°.\r\n\r\nTables 75 to 81 give the principal meteorological data for many places\r\nin the Nile valley and compare the Bombay rainfall with the Assuân\r\ngauges. The latter show how closely the Assuân gauge in flood follows\r\nthe rainfall at Bombay.\r\n\r\nAt Addis Ababa in the highlands of Abyssinia, the mean monthly\r\ntemperature ranges between 19° and 15°, with a mean of 17°. The winds\r\nare south-east and east through the year. In 1902 the rainfall was 980\r\nmillimetres, and in 1903 it was 1340 millimetres. (Table 75).\r\n\r\nAt Wad Medani in the Grezireh south of Khartoum, the mean monthly\r\ntemperature ranges between 35° and 24°, with a mean of 30°. The winds\r\nfrom October to April are from the north and from May to September from\r\nthe south. In 1902 there were 350 millimetres of rain and in 1903 there\r\nwere 310. (Table 76).\r\n\r\nAt Khartoum the mean monthly temperature ranges between 34° and 19°,\r\nwith a mean of 28°. The winds from October to April are from the north\r\nand from May to September from the south. In 1902 there were 120\r\nmillimetres of rain and in 1903 there were 70. (Table 77).\r\n\r\nFor Alexandria, Cairo and Assuân, representing the Nile valley in Egypt,\r\nI have prepared the following table:--\r\n\r\n  =========+====================+====================+====================\r\n           |     ALEXANDRIA     |       CAIRO        |      ASSUAN\r\n           +--------------+-----+--------------+-----+--------------+-----\r\n    MONTH  |  THERMOMETER |Rain-|  THERMOMETER |Rain-|  THERMOMETER |Rain-\r\n           |  Centigrade. |fall.|  Centigrade. |fall.|  Centigrade. |fall.\r\n           +----+----+----+     +----+----+----+     +----+----+----+\r\n           |Max.|Min.|Mean|     |Max.|Min.|Mean|     |Max.|Min.|Mean|\r\n  ---------+----+----+----+-----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+----+-----\r\n           |    |    |    |MILL.|    |    |    |MILL.|    |    |    |MILL.\r\n  January  |25·0| 5·4|24·1|  54 |26·6|-0·7|12·4|   6 |32·5| 4·0|14·8|  ..\r\n  February |29·7| 6·2|14·8|  22 |35·3| 1·2|14·2|   3 |37·0| 5·0|22·0|  ..\r\n  March    |37·0| 5·5|16·1|  17 |41·2| 3·2|16·9|   5 |42·0| 8·0|24·3|  ..\r\n  April    |38·9|11·0|18·5|   2 |42·6| 5·7|20·9|   2 |46·6|11·0|27·3|  ..\r\n  May      |38·9|13·3|21·3|  13 |44·2| 9·0|24·4|   2 |46·0|17·0|29·6|  ..\r\n  June     |39·4|13·8|24·0|  .. |45·2|13·7|27·3|  .. |47·0|20·0|34·2|  ..\r\n  July     |37·0|20·5|26·1|  .. |44·3|17·4|28·5|  .. |46·0|23·0|33·6|  ..\r\n  August   |35·0|20·3|26·6|  .. |41·6|16·5|27·7|  .. |46·0|21·0|35·1|  ..\r\n  September|40·0|18·7|25·6|  .. |40·6|14·0|25·3|  .. |47·0|17·0|31·0|  ..\r\n  October  |37·8|15·0|23·7|   9 |42·1|12·1|23·2|   1 |42·0|18·0|28·7|  ..\r\n  November |32·2|10·8|20·0|  38 |33·6| 3·5|18·1|   6 |40·0|11·0|23·1|  ..\r\n  December |28·9| 6·8|16·0|  80 |29·4| 1·3|14·4|   6 |34·0| 6·0|19·0|  ..\r\n  ---------+----+----+----+-----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+----+-----\r\n  Year     |40·0| 5·5|20·6| 235 |45·2|-0·7|21·1|  31 |47·0| 4·0|26·9|   0\r\n  =========+====+====+====+=====+====+====+====+=====+====+====+====+=====\r\n\r\nFrom the above table we may conclude that at Alexandria, Cairo and\r\nAssuân the absolute maximum thermometers may be taken as 40°, 45° and\r\n47° Centigrade; or 104°, 113°, 116°, Farenheit. The minimum thermometers\r\nas 5·5°, -0·7°, 4·0° Centigrade; or 42°, 31°, 39° Farenheit. The\r\nrainfall at Alexandria, Cairo and Assuân respectively may be taken as\r\n235, 31, and 0 millimetres; or 9, 1¹⁄₄, and 0 inches. The heaviest\r\nrainfall in any individual year at Alexandria and Cairo respectively has\r\nbeen 308 and 55 millimetres; or 12 and 2 inches. The lightest rainfall\r\nat Alexandria and Cairo respectively in any individual year has been 108\r\nand 7 millimetres; or 4¹⁄₄ and ¹⁄₄ inches. Assuân is practically\r\nrainless. It does rain sometimes at Assuân, but there has been no rain\r\nduring the last three years while meteorological observations have been\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. =The Geology of the Nile Valley.=--South of Gondokoro along the\r\nVictoria and Albert Niles, and at the lakes, the rocks are generally\r\ngranites, crystalline schists and quartzites. The hills of Uganda are\r\ncovered with red clay and marl on the higher lands, while the valleys\r\nconsist of a rich black loam. All the cataracts are granites and\r\ngranitic rocks or diorites. The Ruenzori range consists of lofty\r\nvolcanoes. The surface of the ground is covered with a fine Kankar\r\n(nodulated limestone) in many places. North of Gondokoro the plains are\r\nformed of sandy deposits mixed with coarse peat in places. The hills of\r\nthe Bahr-el-Gazelle and Arab river are all crystalline. Abyssinia is a\r\nvolcanic plateau. It is the detritus of this rich volcanic soil swept\r\ndown by the Blue Nile and Atbara which constitutes the richness of the\r\nsoil of Egypt and of the water of the Nile. Those parts of the eastern\r\nSudan south of Khartoum and El-Damer and at Kassala, which are the\r\ndeltas of the Blue Nile, the Dinder, the Rahad, the Atbara, and the\r\nGaäsh, are possessed of a soil in every sense similar to that of Egypt\r\nitself. At Khartoum and in the bed of the Blue Nile at Kamlin are\r\nextensive deposits of nodular limestone corresponding to the Kankars of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe main Nile from Khartoum to Assuân flows between low hills and tables\r\nof Nubian sandstone overlying crystalline rocks of gneiss, mica schists,\r\nhornblendic granite and red granite. Where the crystalline rocks come to\r\nthe surface we have cataracts; where the Nubian sandstone is at the\r\nsurface we have reaches of unbroken water.\r\n\r\nFrom Assuân[4] to near Edfu the Nile flows between hills of Nubian\r\nsandstone, the best known of which is Gebel Silsila. From Edfu to near\r\nLuxor, the Nubian sandstone which overlies the crystalline rocks dips\r\nunder the Nile and its place along the Nile Valley is taken by green and\r\ngrey clays containing nitrate and phosphate deposits. The former are\r\ninexhaustible and have constituted the manure of this part of the valley\r\nfor thousands of years. With these deposits are thick banks of soft\r\nwhite limestone.\r\n\r\n  [4] Condensed from a description of the geology of the Nile Valley in\r\n  Egypt written by Capt. Lyons for the second edition of “Egyptian\r\n  Irrigation”.\r\n\r\nFrom Luxor northwards the clays dip under the Nile and the Nile Valley\r\nis bounded by the superposed white eocene limestone up to Cairo.\r\n\r\nThe Nubian sandstone is always soft and porous. The limestone is\r\ngenerally soft, though hard siliceous beds are sometimes met with. North\r\nof Cairo there is no building stone of any value except the siliceous\r\nsandstone of Gebel Ahmar near Cairo and the basalt of Abu Zabel, a\r\nrecent outcrop furnishing a black rock of great durability. The area\r\ncovered by this rock is small.\r\n\r\nThick deposits of sand and gravel underlie the Nile mud deposits of the\r\nNile Valley. All along the Nile, but especially south of Luxor, river\r\ndeposits of dark sandy mud exist on either side of the Nile Valley\r\nconsiderably above the level of the deposit of to-day. The best known of\r\nthese is the plain of Kom Ombos. The thickness of the layer of Nile mud\r\nin the valley is as much as 18 metres in places, but the average depth\r\nis, I should say, 10 metres.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. =The discharges of the Nile and its tributaries.=--Reference should\r\nbe made to tables 24 and 25 which embody the results of an exhaustive\r\nexamination of the observed discharges, the cross sections, the gauges\r\nof the Nile Valley, and the calculated discharge tables made for these\r\ngauges. Many of these tables are founded on only two or three discharges\r\nand some on only one, but they have been prepared with the greatest care\r\nand referred to all the existing gauge observations, and are good\r\nworking tables, which can be modified and improved as time places more\r\ninformation at our disposal. Until then they may be used as about the\r\nbest approximations available to-day.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the Albert Nile discharged 600 cubic metres per second as\r\nagainst 520 discharged by the Victoria Nile. In 1903 the Victoria Nile\r\ndischarged 730 cubic metres per second and the Albert Nile 800. Leaving\r\na poor year like 1902 which was much below the average, and taking 1903\r\nwhich was all round a good average year and only slightly below the\r\nmean, we have the following results:--\r\n\r\nThe Victoria Nile was at its highest in July with 840 cubic metres per\r\nsecond, while the Albert Nile at its head was at its highest in December\r\nwith 1,060 cubic metres per second. Lake Albert took 5 months to fill\r\nup. At Gondokoro the Albert Nile was at its lowest in April when it\r\ndischarged 700 cubic metres per second as against 550 cubic metres in\r\nthe previous year. Swollen by timely and good rains south of Gondokoro\r\nthe discharge at Gondokoro rose to 2,100 cubic metres per second in\r\nSeptember after the river had scoured out its bed over a metre in depth.\r\nThe mean discharge for the year at Gondokoro was 1,200 cubic metres per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe Gazelle river gave no discharge in the first half of the year and\r\nabout 30 cubic metres per second in the latter half. Its mean discharge\r\nwas 10 cubic metres per second for the year.\r\n\r\nThe Albert Nile at its tail above the Sobat junction gave as a minimum\r\n350 cubic metres per second in March, which discharge rose to 430 cubic\r\nmetres per second in September, but could not rise higher as the Saubat\r\nriver was then in flood and the White Nile could not carry off much more\r\nthan the discharge of the Sobat without putting the northern part of the\r\nSudd region under 2 metres of water. This held back water helped later\r\nto maintain the discharge of the White Nile in January and February.\r\n\r\nThe Sobat river gave as a minimum a discharge of 40 cubic metres per\r\nsecond in April, and then rose to a maximum in November of 1,080 cubic\r\nmetres per second.\r\n\r\nAt its tail, the Albert Nile gave a mean discharge for the year of 390\r\ncubic metres per second and the Sobat of 550.\r\n\r\nThe White Nile at its head was at its lowest in April with 400 cubic\r\nmetres per second and at its highest in December with 1,460 cubic metres\r\nper second, with a mean discharge of 940 cubic metres per second. At its\r\ntail near Khartoum the White Nile was at its lowest in May with 420\r\ncubic metres per second and at its highest in October with about 1,700\r\ncubic metres per second. As this latter figure was about 400 cubic\r\nmetres per second more than it was receiving at its head, the additional\r\nwater represented Blue Nile water which had run up the valley of the\r\nWhite Nile, been stored there while the Blue Nile was high and then been\r\ndischarged into the Main Nile when the Blue Nile had fallen. The mean\r\ndischarge at the tail of the White Nile was 830 cubic metres per second.\r\nThis figure was much below that at the head and was due to the fact that\r\nin July, August and September the Blue Nile water was flowing up the\r\nWhite Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Nile was at its lowest in April when it was discharging 120\r\ncubic metres per second. During its maximum in August and September it\r\nwas discharging 8,200 cubic metres per second. Of the discharge of the\r\nBlue Nile in July, August and September, a considerable part flowed up\r\nthe White Nile which here has a slope of ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀ and a bed from 3,000\r\nto 1,500 metres wide. It is for these reasons that the Blue Nile water\r\ndoes not hurry on to Assuân in its full strength. The mean discharge of\r\nthe Blue Nile for the year was 2,350 cubic metres per second. Gauges and\r\ndischarge tables at Kamlin on the Blue Nile, and north of Omdurman on\r\nthe Main Nile, would be very much better than the Khartoum or Duem\r\ngauges of to-day which are both in back waters.\r\n\r\nThe Atbara river was dry from January to May, in June the discharge was\r\n200 cubic metres per second, rising to 2,300 cubic metres per second in\r\nAugust. In October, November and December it was dry. The mean discharge\r\nfor the year was 380 cubic metres per second. When the Atbara river\r\nrises in flood it cannot flow down the Nile to Egypt in its strength\r\nuntil it has filled up the trough of the Nile as far as the 6th\r\nCataract. Gauges up and down stream of the 6th Cataract and at Shendy\r\nwould be interesting when compared with Berber.\r\n\r\nThe minimum combined discharges of the White Nile, Blue Nile and Atbara\r\nriver were 540 cubic metres per second in April. The maximum combined\r\ndischarges of 10,900 cubic metres per second were in August. The mean\r\ncombined discharges for the year were 3,560 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\nThe minimum discharge of the main Nile above Assuân was 440 cubic metres\r\nper second in May and the maximum of 8,600 cubic metres per second was\r\nin September. The mean discharge for the year was 2,650 cubic metres per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nTable 25 gives the actual daily minimum and maximum discharges during\r\n1902 and 1903 for each stream, with their dates. For the Blue Nile in\r\n1903 they were 100 and 9,600 cubic metres per second; for the White Nile\r\n380 and 1,470; for the Atbara 0 and 3,100; and for the Nile above Assuân\r\n420 and 9,000 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\nTable 26 compares the discharges for a maximum year like 1878, a minimum\r\nyear like 1877, and a mean year, at Khartoum, Assuân and Cairo. The\r\nmaximum discharges in 1877 were 5,300, 5,900 and 4,400 cubic metres per\r\nsecond, at Khartoum, Assuân and Cairo. In 1878 they were 12,500, 12,100\r\nand 10,300 cubic metres per second respectively, while for a mean year\r\nthey are 8,500, 9,200 and 7,200 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\nThe modulus of the river at Assuân is 3,040 cubic metres per second, and\r\nat Cairo 2,640. After the very high flood of 1878, the lowest discharge\r\nin May 1879 at Assuân was 1,500 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the Nile after passing Assuân and entering Egypt may be\r\ndescribed as follows:--of the mean discharge of 3,040 cubic metres per\r\nsecond which passes Assuân 400 cubic metres per second are utilised in\r\nUpper Egypt in the irrigation of 2,320,000 acres and 2,640 cubic metres\r\nper second pass Cairo. Of these again 540 cubic metres per second are\r\nutilised in the irrigation of 3,430,000 acres in Lower Egypt, and only\r\n2,100 cubic metres per second reach the Mediterranean sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe tributaries of the Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. =Lake Victoria Nyanza.=--Lake Victoria, the true source of the Nile,\r\nlies on the Equator, and fed by abundant rains and numerous streams,\r\ndischarges its surplus waters over the Ripon Falls, and gives birth to\r\nthe Victoria Nile. Its most important feeder, the Kagera, whose\r\nsouthernmost tributary rises in the Kangosi hills 2000 metres above sea\r\nlevel in south latitude 4°, has a length of some 600 kilometres. The\r\ndirect line across the lake from the mouth of the Kagera to the Ripon\r\nFalls is 220 kilometres, so that in academical language the length of\r\nthe Nile at the Ripon Falls is already 820 kilometres. Lake Victoria\r\nlies 1129 metres above sea level, and has an area of 60,000 square\r\nkilometres; though until the parallels of longitudes are definitely\r\nsettled, the lake may be credited with an area of between 60,000 and\r\n65,000 square kilometres, constituting it the largest fresh water lake\r\nin the old world. Its waters are beautifully clear and perfectly sweet.\r\nThe depth of the lake is not great and it is covered with many islands.\r\nThe greatest depth found by Commander Whitehouse in the northern half of\r\nthe lake has been 73 metres, while the bays are shallow. The northern,\r\nsouthern and eastern shores of the lake, as described by Sir William\r\nGarstin, are generally clear, while the western shore, especially at the\r\nmouth of the Kagera, is flat, marshy and covered with papyrus. The\r\ncountry surrounding the lake is undulating or hilly and rises to a\r\nheight of 700 metres above the lake at the south-east corner. The rocks\r\nare generally granites, chrystalline schists and quartzites, etc. The\r\nhills are covered with red clay and marl on the higher lands, while the\r\nvalleys consist of a rich black loam.\r\n\r\nThe catchment basin of the lake is 244,000 square kilometres of which\r\n60,000 are water. Most of the important streams feeding the lake\r\ntraverse extensive marshes and swamps and must lose a great part of\r\ntheir waters by evaporation. According to Capt Lyons (Appendix III of\r\nSir William Garstin’s report), the climate of the lake basin is\r\ntypically that which is known as equatorial; two rainy seasons and two\r\ndry seasons make up the year, the rains coinciding more or less with the\r\nequinoxes and the dry seasons with the solstices, except that the second\r\nminor rains are delayed about 1 to 2 months after the autumn equinox. As\r\nCapt. Lyons hopes soon to publish a monograph on the meteorology of the\r\nNile valley, I shall say little about the details of rainfall of the\r\ndifferent catchment basins, contenting myself with broad principles and\r\nmain features. March, April and May form the greater rainy season, and\r\nOctober, November and December the lesser. The rainfall of the former\r\nseason may be considered twice as heavy as that of the latter, but it is\r\nthe latter which practically decides the height of the lake in the\r\nfollowing year. This, according to Capt. Lyons, is due to the fact that\r\nin the summer months, when the rainbelt lies to the north of the lake,\r\nthe dry south winds must blow across the lake basin even though the\r\ndiurnal reversal of winds on the lake is not mastered by them. These dry\r\nwinds greatly increase the evaporation, and there is a marked diminution\r\nof the water between July and November, which must be primarily due to\r\nthe increased evaporation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nRIPON FALLS\r\n\r\nPLAN AND SECTION\r\n\r\nScale 1 : 6.000\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.\r\n\r\nVictoria Nile upstream of Ripon Falls]\r\n\r\nThe rainfall in the catchment basin may be taken as 1250 millimetres per\r\nannum on the average. As the evaporation off the lake is probably the\r\nsame, the area of the lake may be left out of the catchment altogether.\r\nThe balance of the catchment basin amounts to 184,000 square kilometres,\r\non which there is a mean annual rainfall of 230 cubic kilometres. The\r\nmean discharge of the Victoria Nile over the Ripon Falls appears to the\r\napproximately 580 cubic metres per second or 18 cubic kilometres per\r\nannum. This represents about ¹⁄₁₂ the mean rainfall. The greatest\r\ndischarge of the lake seems to be about 850 cubic metres per second and\r\nthe lowest 450. As the lake has risen in a single year 80 centimetres,\r\nwhich represents an increase of water of 48 cubic kilometres, and has\r\nfallen 60 centimetres which represents a decrease of water of 36 cubic\r\nkilometres, it will be seen that the discharges from the lake are\r\nfactors of less importance in determining the level of the lake than the\r\nheavier rainfall and diminished evaporation in a year of good rain, and\r\nthe lighter rainfall and increased evaporation in a year of poor rain.\r\nThe great function of Lake Victoria in the economy of the Nile supply is\r\nthe insuring of a nearly constant discharge of water into the Victoria\r\nNile, and providing much of the evaporation which comes down in the\r\ncatchment basin itself in the shape of rain.\r\n\r\nThe principal feeders of Lake Victoria are the following streams:--\r\n\r\n  on the north (1) Lukos or Yala,\r\n               (2) the Nzoia 250 kilometres long,\r\n               (3) the Sio.\r\n  on the east  (1) the Nyando,\r\n               (2) the Inyayo,\r\n               (3) the Gori,\r\n               (4) the Mara Dabash,\r\n               (5) the Rawana.\r\n  on the south (1) the Symiya,\r\n               (2) the Moame.\r\n  on the west  (1) the Lohungati,\r\n               (2) the Kagera, with its branches the Nyavarongo, the\r\n                   Akanyaru and the Ruvuvu, with a maximum length of 600\r\n                   kilometres and a discharge varying between 140 and\r\n                   some 600 cubic metres per second.\r\n               (3) the Ruizi with a length of 280 kilometres traversing\r\n                   much marshy ground in its course.\r\n           and (4) the Katonga 250 kilometres long.\r\n\r\nThe northern and western feeders are generally perennial streams, while\r\nmany of the southern and eastern are torrents.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. =The Victoria Nile.=--From the Ripon Falls to Lake Albert, the\r\nVictoria Nile has a length of 400 kilometres. The first 64 kilometres\r\nare down a steep slope, in a stream varying from 300 to 500 metres in\r\nwidth. Any project for a regulator at the Ripon Falls should contemplate\r\ndevelopment of electricity for working a railway along these 64\r\nkilometres. The next 237 kilometres are through a flat marshy land,\r\npartly lake, partly swamps, but with the water never more than 4 to 6\r\nmetres deep. In this reach the Nile is navigable. This many-armed swamp\r\nis known as Lake Choga, whose western end is traversed for some 80\r\nkilometres by the Nile with a perceptible current. These large sheets of\r\npapyrus and water, which cover an area of over 2000 square kilometres,\r\nmust cause as much loss by evaporation as they receive by direct\r\nrainfall. The Victoria Nile leaves the lake in a broad stream some 900\r\nmetres wide, past Mruli station, on to Fowera. In the longitudinal\r\nsection on Plate II, I have considered Fowera as 1060 metres above sea\r\nlevel, and the slope upstream of it as ¹⁄₂₀₀₀₀. From Fowera to the foot\r\nof the Murchison Falls, the Nile falls 377 metres on a length of 68\r\nkilometres, and then in the next 30 kilometres reaches Lake Albert.\r\nConsiderable quantities of floating pistea weeds pass down the Victoria\r\nNile from Lake Choga. They are well churned up between Fowera and the\r\nMurchison Falls, but finally enter Lake Albert. It would be easy to\r\ndevelop electricity to work a railway along these 68 kilometres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nCROSS SECTIONS of the NILE & its TRIBUTARIES\r\n\r\n_Horizontal Scale 1 : 2.000_\r\n\r\n_Vertical Scale 1 : 600_\r\n\r\nLith.

And on the left bank; the lake-like Sensiwa; the Kafu with its\r\nnumerous feeders, large catchment basin but generally insignificant\r\ndischarge; and the Titi. The Uganda rivers are more like sponges than\r\nrivers, and in all probability the tail of the Victoria Nile has a\r\ndischarge only slightly in excess of that at the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. =The Semliki River.=--The Semliki river has its sources in Lake\r\nEdward just south of the Equator and flows into the southern end of Lake\r\nAlbert, just as the Victoria Nile flows into the northern end. Lake\r\nEdward with the addition of Lake Dueru has an area of some 2500 square\r\nkilometres and lies about 965 metres above sea level. Its waters as\r\ndescribed by Sir William Garstin, are green in colour and brackish. The\r\nSemliki river discharges the surplus waters of the lake, and may be\r\nconsidered as having a discharge of 100 cubic metres per second as a\r\nminimum and 400 cubic metres per second as a maximum. In some 120\r\nkilometres of its length this river traverses the eastern end of the\r\nCongo forest, and the day may not be far distant when this timber will\r\nbe floated down the Semliki, towed across Lake Albert and sent down the\r\nAlbert Nile to Gondokoro and Khartoum. The fall of the Semliki,\r\naccording to accepted levels is 285 metres in 260 kilometres. The\r\nfeeders of Lake Edward are the following:--\r\n\r\n  On the west, none.\r\n\r\n  On the south, the Rutshuru and Ruendu.\r\n\r\n  On the east, the Msalala, the Wampuna, the Chambura, and the Mpanga\r\n  which has its sources on the slopes of Ruenzori.\r\n\r\n  On the north, numerous glacier-fed torrents from the slopes of\r\n  Ruenzori, the Nyamgasha and the Dibirra. The dry season discharges of\r\n  all these rivers are small. The largest is under 10 cubic metres per\r\n  second. The flood discharges are considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. =Lake Albert Nyanza.=--Lake Albert has an area of 4500 square\r\nkilometres and lies about 680 metres above sea level. We have left the\r\nhigh lands of Uganda and are in the stifling heat of tropical Africa.\r\nThere are considerable deposits of salt along the east shore of Lake\r\nAlbert, as there are also around Lake Edward. According to Sir William\r\nGarstin, the waters of Lake Albert are brackish near the shores, but\r\nperfectly sweet and clear in the middle of the lake. It is due to the\r\nwaters of Lake Victoria that those of Lake Albert are sweet. The\r\ncatchment basin of the Albert Nile at its head where it leaves Lake\r\nAlbert is about 379,000 square kilometres of which 244,000 square\r\nkilometres discharge into Lake Victoria. The rainfall over the\r\nadditional 135,000 square kilometres may be considered as 1250\r\nmillimetres per annum, with seasons similar to those on Lake Victoria.\r\nThe evaporation from Lake Albert must be greater than that from Lake\r\nVictoria, but if we exclude the joint areas of Lakes Victoria, Albert,\r\nEdward and Choga, and taking them as 70,000 square kilometres, consider\r\nthat their rainfall is equalized by their evaporation, there remains\r\nfrom the 379,000 square kilometres of catchment basin about 309,000\r\nsquare kilometres. An annual rainfall of 1250 millimetres means for\r\n309,000 square kilometres a total rainfall of 380 cubic kilometres. The\r\ndischarges of Lake Albert may be taken as varying from 500 cubic metres\r\nper second to 1100, with a mean of 800 cubic metres per second. This\r\nlatter figure represents in one year 26 cubic kilometres or ¹⁄₁₅th the\r\nannual rainfall. We may compare with this the mean discharge of Lake\r\nVictoria of about 580 cubic metres per second and ¹⁄₁₂th of the annual\r\nrainfall of its catchment basin excluding the lake area.\r\n\r\nA reference to Plate V will show how great is the regulating effect of\r\nLake Albert on the Nile. Owing to the fact that an increase in the\r\ndischarge of the Victoria Nile cannot pass down the Albert Nile before\r\nthe whole area of Lake Albert has risen, the floods of the Victoria Nile\r\nare delayed nearly 5 months in their passage down the Albert Nile; a\r\nrise of 1 metre on Lake Albert meaning an increased cube of\r\n4,500,000,000 cubic metres. If this takes place in one year, it\r\nrepresents an increased discharge of 150 cubic metres per second\r\nirrespective of what passes down the channel of Lake Albert.\r\n\r\nIf it were considered necessary to insure 1200 cubic metres per second\r\nas the discharge of the Albert Nile from the 15th January to the 15th\r\nMay, it would mean adding 400 cubic metres per second to the mean\r\ndischarge for 4 months, and deducting 200 cubic metres per second from\r\nthe mean discharge for the remaining 8 months. By storing the surplus\r\nwaters of good years by means of a weir capable of holding up 3 or 4\r\nmetres of water at the outlet of the lake, it would be possible to\r\ninsure this discharge every year during the four months which decide the\r\nsummer contingent of the White Nile to the Nile in Egypt during the\r\nmonths of April, May, June and July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\nGAUGE & DISCHARGE DIAGRAM of LAKES VICTORIA & ALBERT\r\n\r\n_Luba (subsequently Jinja) gauge, near the Ripon Falls, represents Lake\r\nVictoria._\r\n\r\n_Wadelai gauge (60 km. below Lake Albert) represents Lake Albert._\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.]\r\n\r\nThe shores of Lake Albert are generally steep and barren, though in\r\nplaces they are shelving and covered with papyrus, notably at the inlets\r\nof the Semliki river and the Victoria Nile. The Lake is fairly deep and\r\nadmirably suited for a reservoir. At the outlet of the lake enormous\r\nquantities of pistea weeds, especially in high floods, enter the Albert\r\nNile. The passage of these weeds through the future regulator of Lake\r\nAlbert will be an exceedingly interesting engineering problem.\r\n\r\nThe principal feeders of the lake are:--\r\n\r\n  On the north, the Victoria Nile.\r\n\r\n  On the east, the Waiga, the Wakki, the Hoima, the Wahamba, the Horo,\r\n  the Ngusi and Msisi, discharging between them under 20 cubic metres\r\n  per second in the dry season, though good streams in flood.\r\n\r\n  On the south, the Semliki; and no streams worth mentioning on the\r\n  west.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. =The Albert Nile.=--The Albert Nile, or the Bahr-el-Gebel, has a\r\nlength of 1280 kilometres from Lake Albert to the mouth of the Sobat\r\nriver. For 218 kilometres, past Wadelai to Dufile, it has a broad stream\r\nwith a sluggish current as a rule, and covered with islands and papyrus\r\nmarshes. This reach of the Nile is navigable. The fall here must be very\r\nlittle, and it may be considered as 8 metres. In high floods enormous\r\nquantities of pistea weeds float down this reach of the Nile. Papyrus\r\nand ambatch are very common along the shores and on the islands.\r\n\r\nAt Dufile begin the Fola rapids followed by numerous cataracts up to\r\nFort Berkeley. In this reach of 155 kilometres the river falls 223\r\nmetres. Sir William Garstin states that some of the falls have a width\r\nof only 12 metres. The depth must be extraordinary, while the velocity\r\nis terrific. The green water of the upper reaches is purified in its\r\npassage through these cataracts. The rock is granite. If the regulator\r\nfor Lake Albert were constructed near Dufile, it should contemplate\r\ndevelopment of electricity for working a railway along these 155\r\nkilometres.\r\n\r\nSouth of Dufile the principal tributaries of the Albert Nile are on the\r\nright bank viz: the Achua and Umi. In the dry season they are dry, but\r\nafter rains they may add some 50 cubic metres per second to the river.\r\nBetween Dufile and Fort Berkeley many rivers flow into the Albert Nile.\r\nThe Asua, the Atappi, the Umi, the Karpetu, the Kweh and many others\r\nfrom the right bank bring down water in flood well laden with sand. In\r\nthe dry season all but the Asua are dry. The left bank tributaries are\r\nnumerous but insignificant. The volume discharged by these streams in\r\nthe rainy season is very considerable, as will be seen if the discharges\r\nat Gondokoro north of Fort Berkeley are compared with those at Wadelai.\r\nThey are between them capable of increasing the discharge of the Albert\r\nNile for short intervals of time by 1500 cubic metres per second. All\r\nthese streams are torrential. They rise and fall quickly.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Berkeley to Khartoum, the Albert and White Niles are\r\nnavigable.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Berkeley to Bor past Gondokoro on a length of 206 kilometres\r\nthe Albert Nile falls some 18 metres and has a good velocity and slope,\r\nand though the river is divided into two and more channels, it is within\r\nits banks and may be considered an ordinary river. The maximum discharge\r\nis about 2600 cubic metres per second and the minimum 550. In high\r\nfloods the river scours out its bed and sides very considerably. The\r\nreal flat lands begin at Gondokoro a little to the north of Fort\r\nBerkeley. The soil is light and sandy and capable of offering little\r\nresistance to the stream. Between Gondokoro and Bor the Albert Nile can\r\nlose some 30 per cent of its discharge when the river is high and\r\ncapable of overflowing most of the islands and a great part of the\r\nvalley. The main channel has a width of about 230 metres and depth of 3\r\nor 4 metres when the discharge is below 600 cubic metres per second and\r\nwell within banks. The main tributaries of the Albert Nile in this reach\r\nare on the east bank, the Kit, second only to the Asua, and the\r\nLokadero; and on the west bank a number of unimportant torrents which\r\nhowever help to swell the river in flood.\r\n\r\nFrom Bor to Ghaba Shambe on a length of 196 kilometres, the main stream\r\nof the Albert Nile flows between banks lower than those further south\r\nand more heavily inundated in flood, with a width of some 60 metres and\r\ndepth of water of 5 metres. According to Sir William Garstin, the grass\r\nswamps end half way down this reach and the papyrus swamps begin. About\r\n10 kilometres to the east of the main stream is another branch known as\r\nthe Atem river fed by artificially maintained and natural spills from\r\nthe main stream itself. These spills are kept open by the Dinkas living\r\nalong the Atem river. They were noted by Werne in 1842. The Atem river\r\nat its tail apparently divides into two branches, of which one feeds the\r\nZeraf river and the other returns to the Nile at Ghaba Shambe.\r\n\r\nCapt. Lyons has pointed out to me that all this course of the river is\r\nextraordinarily like the course of the Mississippi south of Vicksburg,\r\nwith its severe curves and oxrings which correspond to the mayahs of the\r\nAlbert Nile. Such mayahs or lagoons can be seen in the last 20\r\nkilometres of the Rosetta branch of the Nile. Placed as they are between\r\nBor and Ghaba Shambe, they mean that while south of Bor, the Albert Nile\r\nhas more or less formed its delta; north of Bor, the delta is in a more\r\nembryonic stage, with probably the Atem river the more ancient of the\r\ntwo streams. North of Ghaba Shambe, the Zeraf river leaves the Albert\r\nNile, and fed by the Atem Nile, takes off its water eastwards through\r\nmarsh and swamp to again tail into the Albert Nile below Lake No. About\r\n30 kilometres further north is the cut made by Sir Samuel Baker to\r\nenable him to enter the Albert Nile from the Zeraf river.\r\n\r\nThe real Sudd region lies between Ghaba Shambe and Lake No, on a length\r\nof 380 kilometres. Between Fort Berkeley and Gondokoro, the flood as\r\nwell as the summer supplies are within banks. Between Gondokoro and Bor,\r\nthe summer supply is well within banks, but the floods overflow the\r\nvalley. Between Bor and Ghaba Shambe the summer supply is just within\r\nbanks, but the floods overflow freely. Between Ghaba Shambe and Lake No\r\nthe summer supply overflows the banks, and hence there result the\r\nperiodical barrings or sudds of the Nile by the floating vegetation so\r\ncommon in this region. While the summer supply is within banks it can\r\ninsure a clear waterway; but when not only the floods but the summer\r\nsupplies ordinarily overflow the banks, the stream must be aided\r\nartificially if it is to keep its waterway clear.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary width of the river south of Hillet-el-Nuer is between 50\r\nand 60 metres, but in the reach of the old sudd blocks numbers 16 to 19\r\nit diminishes in places to 25 metres, and in the reach blocked by sudd\r\nblock number 15 increases to 200. North of Hillet-el-Nuer, the width\r\nvaries from 60 to 150 metres, but the mean width may be taken as from 75\r\nto 80 metres. The velocity is about 75 centimetres per second, which is\r\na good velocity for clear water; and Sir William Garstin remarks at one\r\nplace that since the sudds were cleared the channel of the Albert Nile\r\nseems to be deepening and widening itself, and he states in another\r\nplace that the extent of overflow over the mayahs or side depressions is\r\ndecreasing.\r\n\r\nWith proper training works and dredging it should be possible to reduce\r\nthe length of the main channel of the Albert Nile between Gondokoro and\r\nBor from 175 kilometres to 160; between Bor and Ghaba Shambe from 206\r\nkilometres to 145; and between Ghaba Shambe and Lake No from 380\r\nkilometres to 305. Or the length of channel from Gondokoro to Lake No\r\nmight be reduced from 761 kilometres to 610. Some of the curves are\r\nnearly complete circles, needing but little work to cut off extensive\r\nlengths.\r\n\r\nBetween Ghaba Shambe and Lake No there were 19 sudd blocks of which all\r\nbut one were removed by Major Peake, R. A., and Lieut. Drury, R. N., in\r\n1900 and 1901. Their positions are indicated on Plate VI. South of\r\nHillet-el-Nuer is sudd block No. 15, the only one remaining to be\r\nremoved. Owing to this block, the Albert Nile leaves its true channel,\r\nwhich is from 5 to 6 metres deep, and, on a length of 43 kilometres,\r\nfollows a series of mayahs, pools and marshes with a depth of from 1¹⁄₄\r\nto 2 metres. The original channel was closed by a boat laden with ivory\r\nsinking in the true channel during the Dervish domination. The boat has\r\nbeen found, the ivory recovered and the work of sudd clearing commenced,\r\nbut the work has not yet been completed.\r\n\r\nThe maximum discharge of the Albert Nile at Hillet-el-Nuer may be taken\r\nas 450 cubic metres per second, and into Lake No as 320 cubic metres per\r\nsecond. The water of the river is dark-coloured and contains no\r\nsediment. Very little ambatch is met with north of Ghaba Shambe.\r\n\r\nBetween Ghaba Shambe and Lake No on the left bank, in the first 120\r\nkilometres, three channels carrying very appreciable quantities of water\r\nflow into the Albert Nile. These are considered to be the tails of the\r\nriver Yei. At Hillet-el-Nuer, about 170 kilometres north of Ghaba\r\nShambe, a branch takes off from the west side of the Albert Nile, known\r\nas Gage’s channel, with 35 metres of clear waterway, 1 metre depth and\r\n0·60 metre per second velocity, discharging 20 cubic metres per second.\r\nThis stream flows westwards and is lost in the swamps. On the right\r\nbank, downstream of Ghaba Shambe, are the two heads of the Bahr Zeraf,\r\none natural and the other artificial made by Sir Samuel Baker. About 90\r\nkilometres north of Ghaba Shambe a few spills take water towards the\r\nZeraf river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ALBERT NILE.\r\n\r\nFROM GONDOKORO TO THE SOBAT JUNCTION\r\n\r\nScale 1 : 2,000,000\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.\r\n\r\nPart of Albert Nile\r\n\r\n_South of Sudd No. 15_]\r\n\r\nFrom Lake No to the Sobat mouth, on a length of 134 kilometres is the\r\ntail reach of the Albert Nile. The Albert Nile flows into Lake No in its\r\nsouth-eastern corner and leaves it on its east side. On the west side\r\nthe Gazelle river flows into the lake. Lake No has an area of some 20\r\nsquare kilometres in times of low supply and 100 square kilometres in\r\nflood. In low supply the depth is between 1·50 and 2·50 metres. In the\r\nreach between Lake No and the Sobat mouth, the river is very fairly\r\nstraight; the summer channel is about 170 metres wide and as a rule\r\nabout 5 metres deep upstream of the mouth of the Lolle, though in one\r\nplace about 8 kilometres from Lake No it becomes only 50 metres wide for\r\na short distance. Between the tail of the Lolle river and the mouth of\r\nthe Sobat river, the summer width widens out to about 400 metres with 3\r\nmetres depth of water. However extensive the marshes may be, the high\r\nland forming the limit of the inundation is everywhere in this reach\r\nvisible from the main stream. The Gazelle river, which flows into Lake\r\nNo, has a discharge varying from 0 to 40 cubic metres per second. The\r\nLolle river which flows in on the left bank upstream of the Sobat mouth\r\nis probably an arm of the Albert Nile or an overflow of the Gazelle and\r\nhas a discharge varying from 0 to 40 cubic metres per second. On the\r\nright bank, the Zeraf river flows into the Albert Nile, with a discharge\r\nvarying from 30 to 160 cubic metres per second. The Megahid river flows\r\nin 30 kilometres below the tail of the Zeraf river and adds an\r\nundetermined quota of water.\r\n\r\nAt its junction with the Sobat river, the Albert Nile discharges from\r\n300 to 450 cubic metres in summer; it does not discharge much more in\r\nflood as the waters of the Sobat river in flood hold up the Albert River\r\nand make it overflow the low lands up to Lake No and beyond for a depth\r\nof 3 metres in high floods. This reach of the Nile is a flood reservoir,\r\nwhich empties itself ordinarily by the end of winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. =The Gazelle River.=--The Gazelle river, which flows into Lake No,\r\nhas a catchment basin of 240,000 square kilometres, with an annual\r\nrainfall of 75 millimetres; and an additional catchment basin of 230\r\nsquare kilometres with an annual rainfall of 30 millimetres; and yet the\r\nriver discharges nothing in summer and about 40 cubic metres per second\r\nin flood. It is the most extraordinary river in the world, often blocked\r\nby sudd and invisible. It has practically no banks in flood or in times\r\nof low supply, while the waterway varies in width from 6 metres to 90\r\nand in depth from 2 metres to 6 metres. It makes its way between\r\ninterminable marshes of papyrus and water grasses. The Gazelle river is\r\na deltaic river in a still more embryonic stage than the Albert Nile\r\nnorth of Ghaba Shambe. It, however, performs one good function. It keeps\r\nthe swamps of the Sudd region full of water, year in and year out; and\r\nwithout it, the water of the Albert Nile would doubtless be lost by\r\npercolation in the Sudd region and the White Nile be left high and dry\r\nfor 3 months every year.\r\n\r\nSchweinfurth was the first to ascend and describe this river and its\r\ntributaries. Beginning from the east, its principal tributaries\r\nare:--the Rohl, the Dyow, the Tondy, the Kit, the Dyûr, the Dembo, the\r\nHumr and the Bahr el Arab. With courses of between 450 and 750\r\nkilometres in length, the tributaries fall from 500 to 700 metres in\r\ntheir upper courses of from 300 to 500 kilometres, and in their\r\nremaining courses they traverse swamps. Certain of the tributaries may\r\nbe discharging 10 cubic metres per second in summer and 250 cubic metres\r\nper second in flood, but the main stream of the Gazelle seems never to\r\nadd more than 40 cubic metres per second to the Albert Nile. The whole\r\nof the water is evaporated from the weeds, papyrus, watergrasses and\r\nopen sheets of water which cover a desolate area of 70,000 square\r\nkilometres. Evaporation and rainfall balance each other. If the\r\n«Singhara» or Indian water nut could be induced to grow in this waste of\r\nwaters, some profit might be got out of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. =The Bahr Zeraf.=--The Bahr Zeraf is the right hand branch of the\r\nAlbert Nile which leaves the latter river north of Ghaba Shambe and\r\njoins it again midway between Lake No and the Sobat river. It is fed\r\nlargely by the escape water of the Atem river brought down in a\r\ntraceable channel and in flood by torrents from the hilly region east of\r\nGondokoro. Beginning with a series of marshes and swamps, it gradually\r\nestablishes its right to be called a river and finally after a tortuous\r\nand meandering course of about 270 kilometres tails into the Albert\r\nNile. In its lower reaches it is about 50 metres wide and from 2 to 4\r\nmetres deep in summer and 6 to 8 metres deep in flood. Its discharges\r\nvary from 30 cubic metres per second in summer to 160 cubic metres per\r\nsecond in flood. In its lower reaches the banks consist of solid earth,\r\nproving that at one time it carried water other than that brought down\r\nby the Albert Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. =The Sobat River.=--This river drains 156,000 square kilometres\r\nlying between the catchment basins of Lake Rudolf and the Blue Nile. The\r\nrainfall in the mountainous region of Gallaland is plentiful and\r\nespecially heavy in autumn, and were it not for the extensive lakes and\r\nmarshes in its middle course, it would be a torrent in flood. Regulated\r\nand restrained by the lakes and marshes, this river has an\r\nextraordinarily even rise and fall, as a reference to Table 24 will\r\ncertify. It is unfortunate that the Nasser gauge has been read so\r\ninterruptedly. The Doleb Hilla gauge is in the back water of the Albert\r\nNile and not very reliable. The discharges of the last four years have\r\nvaried from 40 cubic metres per second in low supply to 1000 cubic\r\nmetres in flood, though there have been years when the discharges have\r\nfallen to zero in summer and when the flood must have exceeded 1500\r\ncubic metres per second. April is the month of low supply and November\r\nof maximum flood.\r\n\r\nIn its last 50 kilometres, the river has a deep, well defined channel\r\nbetween high banks, which are never topped in the highest floods. The\r\nwidth of waterway is about 110 metres and the depth 7 metres in summer\r\nand about 10 to 11 metres in flood.\r\n\r\nThe principal tributaries of the Sobat are the Baro from the north-east\r\nand east, and the Akobo and Pibor from the south-east and south. All the\r\ntributaries meet and form extensive swamps from which the Sobat has its\r\norigin. The village of Nasser is situated on the Sobat near its origin.\r\nA gauge has been erected here.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. =The Sudd region.=--The Sudd region of the Albert Nile lies north of\r\nGhaba Shambe and corresponds to that part of the river where not only do\r\nthe floods overflow the banks, but the summer supplies can do so in many\r\nplaces. It is the delta of the river in a very embryonic stage. There\r\nare two main branches to the river, the Albert Nile proper and the\r\nZeraf, which have both been already described. Both these rivers are\r\nliable to be blocked by sudd or blocks of living vegetation. These\r\nblocks are sometimes as much as 5 metres thick and capable of turning\r\nnearly the whole supply of the river out of its course. They are formed\r\nof papyrus, weeds and watergrasses, which grow on the half sandy half\r\npeaty banks of the lagoons and marshes traversed by the river, and\r\nwhich, under the double action of a rising flood and strong winds, are\r\ntorn up and driven into the channels wherever they are confined in\r\nwidth, and there jammed into solid masses of floating weeds, filling the\r\nwhole width of the river, very nearly the whole depth, and sometimes\r\nover a kilometre in length. In addition to the local weeds and grasses,\r\nthere are always at hand in high floods dense masses of pistea weeds\r\nwhich have come from the upper waters of the Albert Nile south of\r\nDufile. While the sudd floats it is not so bad as when it sinks, as it\r\nhas done at block No. 15 north of Gaba Shambe, where the Nile has left\r\nits course for 37 kilometres owing to sunken sudd. When the sudd sinks,\r\nits becomes putrid and especially loathsome.\r\n\r\nThe Sudd region is unmistakably, as Lombardini pointed out years ago, an\r\nold lake which has silted up and become full of peat and sand deposits.\r\nAt one time the lake must have had an extreme length of 400 kilometres\r\nand width of 400 kilometres and been a larger sheet of water than lake\r\nVictoria. The Sobat river flowed into it, and the Blue Nile may have\r\nflowed backwards up the bed of the present White Nile for tens of\r\nthousands of years. The north-east corner has been better filled with\r\ndeposit than any other part.\r\n\r\nThe dense masses of papyrus and water-grasses which shut out the horizon\r\nin every direction intimidated the expedition sent up the Nile by Nero,\r\nand it returned northwards without having accomplished anything. From\r\nNero’s time to that of Mehemet Ali little was known of these regions.\r\nMehemet Ali made a determined effort to discover what lay beyond these\r\ninhospitable regions, and sent up a well-equipped expedition under\r\nD’Arnaud.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest descriptions of the Nile between the fifth and tenth\r\nparallels of latitude is by Werne, who accompanied D’Arnaud’s expedition\r\nsent by Mehemet Ali in 1840-1841. The expedition found the channel of\r\nthe White Nile and Albert Nile easily navigable between December and\r\nMarch. The Albert Nile between 7° and 9° N. lat. had apparently a mean\r\nwidth of 120 metres, depth of 5 metres, and velocity of about 60\r\ncentimetres per second, giving a discharge of some 400 cubic metres per\r\nsecond. In this first description of the river the fact that strikes one\r\nmost forcibly is the omission of the Bahr Zeraf. Neither the inlet nor\r\nthe outlet are mentioned, though the Sobat, the Gazelle, and numerous\r\ninsignificant streams are minutely recorded. Practically the whole of\r\nthe water was confined to one stream, and that a good one. The water\r\nlevel in winter was found to be some 50 centimetres below the general\r\nlevel of the berm, and about 60 centimetres above this level in flood.\r\nThe swamps contained offensive and fetid water, which mixed with the\r\nwaters of the rising flood and helped to pollute the stream on the first\r\nrise of the river. Between the river and the swamps in its southern\r\nreaches were numerous cuts and openings, some natural and some\r\nartificial, made by the aborigines for fishing purposes. While\r\ntraversing the swamps, the waters of the river in flood lost their silt\r\nand became quite clear. On page 100 of Vol. II of Werne’s work there is\r\nthis significant sentence: “The report that the natives below (i.e. in\r\nlatitude 5° to 7°) had blocked the river to cut off our retreat, turned\r\nout to be unfounded.” From the above it will be noticed that the\r\naborigines in 1840-1841 spoke of their ability to block the course of\r\nthe river, while the training works in the side channels and spills for\r\nfishing purposes were described as solid works regulated by rows of\r\nstrong stakes driven into the ground.\r\n\r\nBetween 1841 and 1863 the expeditions up the Nile considerably\r\nincreased, while the aborigines were being brutally treated by the slave\r\ntraders. What could be more natural than that, as a measure of\r\nprotection, the aborigines should have widened and deepened the side\r\nchannels and spills which took off from the river between latitudes\r\n5¹⁄₂° and 7¹⁄₂°, so that they might escape from the traders.\r\nSubsequently, when the main river was patrolled by Government boats, the\r\nslave-traders themselves used these side channels for prosecuting their\r\ntraffic. All the channels and spills tailed into the Bahr Zeraf, which\r\nnow began to form an appreciable stream, and which was navigated over\r\nthe lower part of its course by Petherick between 1853 and 1862. The\r\nBahr Zeraf was however always described as sudded, while the Albert Nile\r\nwas open to navigation. This action of dissipating the waters of the\r\nriver went on increasing till 1863, when there occurred a very high\r\nflood indeed; the floating weeds brought down from the south were\r\nexcessive, the waters escaped everywhere from the main stream, while the\r\nfloating masses of creepers were confined by the grasses and papyrus to\r\nthe main channel, and sudded it downstream of Lake No.\r\n\r\nOn ascending the White Nile and Albert Nile in January 1863, Sir Samuel\r\nBaker found the passage clear to the south. On returning in April 1865,\r\nhe found the sudd of the flood of 1863 still in the Albert Nile\r\ndownstream of Lake No. The sudd was 1000 metres long and had a passage 3\r\nmetres wide cut through the middle of it, down which the river ran like\r\na mill race.\r\n\r\nIn February 1869, Dr. Schweinfurth and his party, on their way to the\r\nGazelle, took six days to get through this sudd, though the main\r\nobstruction was now only 200 metres long. In July 1872, Dr. Schweinfurth\r\non his way back found the sudd to the downstream of Lake No as before,\r\nand described the opening through it as “a narrow stream of water which\r\nrushed along as a wild brook. The depth of the fairway varied from 2 to\r\n3 metres, and the boat nowhere touched the bottom.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1870 Sir Samuel Baker found the sudd in the Albert Nile\r\nimpossible for his expedition of heavily laden boats and steamers. He\r\nfound the Zeraf sudded in its southern 100 kilometres, and tried to cut\r\nhis way through but failed. And yet the slave traders had means of\r\ngetting slave boats down the Bahr Zeraf (“Ismailia” pages 61, 62 and\r\n29). Baker returned in January 1871 to the Zeriba Kutchuk Ali on the\r\nBahr Zeraf and had before him the 100 kilometres of sudded channel. With\r\nthe aid of 1200 men he completed the work by March 13. The final\r\noperation was a canal through stiff clay 600 metres long (known to-day\r\nas Baker’s cut). The fall from the Albert Nile into the Bahr Zeraf was\r\nso great that, in order to get the boats and steamers across the final\r\ndistance, Baker made a dam 120 metres long across the Zeraf by means of\r\na double row of piles, sand bags and fascines of the tall grasses. He\r\nthus secured the necessary depth of water, and the flotilla sailed into\r\nthe Albert Nile. On his way back in June 1873, he thus describes the\r\nappearance of the head of the Ziraf river where he had made the cut in\r\nMarch 1871:--\r\n\r\n“On arrival at the Bahr Zeraf cut, we found that the canals which we had\r\nformerly cut were much improved by the force of the stream. Although\r\nthese passages were narrow, they had become deep and we progressed with\r\ncomparatively little trouble.” The rest of the journey down the Bahr\r\nZeraf was easily performed.\r\n\r\nIn January 1874, when the river was low, the sudd in the Albert Nile was\r\nremoved by Ismail Pacha Ayoub, Governor General of the Soudan.\r\n\r\nFrom 1874 to 1878, while Gordon was Governor General, the Albert Nile\r\nwas clear of sudd, but the wide stream of 1840 had dwindled down to a\r\nclear waterway free of weeds on a width of 6 metres over long reaches.\r\nThe escape of water down numerous spills had deprived the Albert Nile of\r\nthe power of keeping its channel clear and when the heavy flood of 1878\r\ncame down, the river was sudded.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Gessi was blocked in the Bahr Gazelle. The sudd in this Bahr was\r\ncut by Marno, who also cut the sudd in the Albert Nile in April 1880.\r\n\r\nEmin Pasha mentions the fact that the Albert Nile was free of sudd and\r\nnavigated from 1880 to 1883. In 1884 he states that no steamers reached\r\nLado, but he attributed that to the Mahdi’s rebellion.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the Mahdi’s and Khalifa’s rule there was no\r\nsudd. In the Khalifa’s time a boat laden with ivory sank in the stream\r\nwhere sudd block No. 15 is, south of Hillet-el-Nuer, and caused the\r\nblock to form.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Lord Kitchener found the Albert Nile sudded south of Lake No,\r\nand in March 1899 Sparkes bey, of the Egyptian Army, steamed up the Bahr\r\nZeraf to within 30 kilometres of its head.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Sir William Garstin thought the Bahr Zeraf a stronger\r\nstream than the Albert Nile.\r\n\r\nDescending the Albert Nile from Uganda, Colonel Martyr found the Albert\r\nNile sudded 30 kilometres north of Ghaba Shambe.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 and 1901 Major Peake, C. M. G., R. A., and Lieut. Drury, R. N.,\r\nremoved sudd blocks Nos. 1 to 14, and 16 to 19, between Lake No and\r\nGhaba Shambe. There now remains only block No. 15 south of\r\nHillet-el-Nuer.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the channel to-day has been described under the heading\r\nof the Albert Nile. It is a very fair channel except at the diversion\r\nround block No. 15, which Sir William Garstin is very eager to see\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. =The White Nile.=--The White Nile stretches from the Sobat mouth to\r\nKhartoum and has a length of 838 kilometres and very little fall. It\r\neverywhere bears traces of having been the channel of the Blue Nile when\r\nin ancient times the Gebel-Royan hill had not been cut through by the\r\nNile, and the Blue Nile itself flowed south into the great lake which is\r\nto-day the sudd region of the Albert Nile. If the Blue Nile discharged,\r\nas it does to-day, about 2500 cubic metres per second throughout the\r\nyear, the Sobat 600 cubic metres, the Albert Nile 1000, the Gazelle\r\ntributaries 700, and the rainfall on the lake itself was 1 metre per\r\nannum, while the evaporation was 2¹⁄₂ metres, (all reasonable figures),\r\nthe water entering the lake was 300 cubic kilometres per annum and the\r\nevaporation was the same, provided the lake had an area of 120,000\r\nsquare kilometres, which is, moreover, reasonable when we examine the\r\nplan. During the whole of this period, the valley of the Nile in Egypt\r\nreceived its water from the Atbara alone.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Sobat river in flood give its name to the White Nile.\r\nAt Tewfikieh, near the head of the White Nile, is a gauge. For the first\r\n500 kilometres the river is described by Sir William Garstin as having a\r\nwaterway of from 300 to 500 metres in width with numerous islands. The\r\ndepth of water in summer is 5 metres and 7 metres in flood. On either\r\nside of the waterway is a low ridge swamped in flood, and beyond that on\r\neither side is a deep depression, deep in the centre and rising to the\r\nridge on one side and to the high land and forest on the other. Each\r\ndepression may be 3 kilometres in width where it is wide and a few\r\nhundred metres where it is narrow, so that the flooded valley may have a\r\nwidth of 6 kilometres in places. The ridges are about 3 metres wide, and\r\nbroken by openings through which the water passes in and out of the side\r\nmarshy depressions. The depressions are covered by a dense growth of\r\nreeds and papyrus. When the reeds are burnt one can traverse the marshes\r\non foot. South of Kaka (200 kilometres north of the Sobat mouth) the\r\ndepressions are lower than they are further north, which, to me, goes to\r\nprove that the channel of to-day is formed within the channel of old\r\ndays when the Blue Nile was flowing south into the Sudd region. At\r\nGebelain (250 kilometres north of Kaka) the side depressions contract\r\nand the forests come nearer the river. At the Abu Zeid ford, 50\r\nkilometres further to the north, is a serious obstacle to navigation\r\nwhen the river is low, in the shape of a very broad sheet of shingle\r\nstudded thick with fresh-water oysters. This bar is 6 kilometres long,\r\nas hard as stone, and has in very low summer supplies a depth of water\r\nover it of only 50 centimetres. It is a wonder that a channel has not\r\nbeen blasted through it. The swamping now visibly decreases and the\r\nwidth of the river varies from 700 to 900 metres. Some 25 kilometres\r\nnorth of Abu Zeid the papyrus and sudd grasses disappear, and though\r\nthere is flooding there are no swamps. We have now some well cultivated\r\nislands in the river for the negroes have come to an end and the Arabs\r\ninhabit the country. The summer channel may be now considered as 700\r\nmetres wide and the flood channel as 1300 metres. The summer depth of\r\nwater is 4 metres. At Duem, 220 kilometres south of Khartoum, the width\r\nof the channel widens from 900 to 1000 and further north to 1500 metres,\r\nand finally to 3000 metres. We are in a lake rather than in a river, and\r\nin flood when the waters of the Blue Nile travel 300 kilometres up the\r\nWhite Nile, and wait for a fall in the Blue Nile to discharge themselves\r\ninto the Nile, we are indeed in a pulsating lake and not in a river. It\r\nmust have been in September, when the discharge of the Blue Nile had\r\nfallen from some 11,000 to 6,000 cubic metres per second, and the\r\nstored-up waters in the valley of the White Nile were forcing themselves\r\ndown to take the place of those cut off from the Blue Nile, that Linant\r\nPasha took his discharges of the Blue and White Niles and found them\r\nsome 6000 and 5000 cubic metres per second respectively. The same remark\r\nmay be made about M. Chélu’s discharge of the White Nile at Khartoum of\r\n4000 cubic metres per second in September 1876 and mentioned in his book\r\n“_Le Nil, le Soudan, l’Égypte_,” page 17.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\nCROSS SECTIONS OF THE NILE & ITS TRIBUTARIES\r\n\r\n_Horizontal Scale 1 : 2.000_\r\n\r\n_Vertical Scale 1 : 500_\r\n\r\nLith.

Table 24 gives the behaviour of the\r\nriver. The minimum discharge of the White Nile at Khartoum may be taken\r\nas 300 cubic metres per second. The preceding paragraph will explain how\r\ndifficult it will be to know its maximum discharge until a gauge and\r\ndischarge table are established for the Blue Nile 100 kilometres above\r\nKhartoum well above back water, and a gauge and discharge table in the\r\nMain Nile north of Omdurman. The difference between these two discharges\r\nwill be the true discharge of the White Nile which, with its slope of\r\n¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀ in flood, is not a river but a flood reservoir. The discharges\r\ntaken at Duem on the White Nile and at Khartoum on the Blue Nile in 1902\r\nand 1903 are interesting, but of little value for anything except the\r\nvery date on which they were taken. They were all in backwaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. =The Blue Nile.=--Compared to any river we have yet described, the\r\nBlue Nile is a true mountain stream. Draining the southern and more\r\nrainy half of Abyssinia, it is the principal source of the Nile in\r\nflood. Whatever waters it receives, it carries to the Nile and it is the\r\ntrue parent of the land of Egypt, for the deposit from its muddy waters\r\nis that Nile mud which has made Egypt. The Atbara carries waters which\r\nare probably more muddy than those of the Blue Nile, but compared to the\r\nBlue Nile the Atbara is a small river, and its quota is insignificant by\r\nthe side of that of the larger stream. The principal tributary of the\r\nBlue Nile, the Abai, rises at a height of about 2,700 metres above sea\r\nlevel and after a course of 110 kilometres falls into Lake Tsana. Lake\r\nTsana lies at a level of about 1,760 metres above sea level, and has an\r\narea of about 3,000 square kilometres and catchment basin of about\r\n14,000 square kilometres irrespective of the lake area. On the 31st of\r\nJanuary 1903, after a very poor rainfall, Mr. C. Dupuis found the\r\ndischarge 42 cubic metres per second. Calculating from his cross\r\nsection, it seems that the maximum discharge may be 200 cubic metres per\r\nsecond. As at Lake Victoria, possibly not more than ¹⁄₁₂th the rainfall\r\nfinds its way into the lake; and, once there, the greater part is\r\nevaporated. Little seems to leave the lake, which would consequently\r\nmake a very poor reservoir. The land rises from the lake in gently\r\nundulating downs as a rule. Wherever observed by Mr. Dupuis, the lake\r\nwas shallow. There are many islands and some of them considerable ones.\r\nThe rivers feeding the lake are the following:--the Abai discharging 9\r\ncubic metres per second in January 1903, the Reb 2 cubic metres, the\r\nGumara 2, the Magetch 0·3, the Arno Garno 0·3, the Gelda 0·5, the Unfraz\r\n1·2, and many smaller streams say 1·7, or 17 cubic metres per second in\r\nall. This of course was in the dry season. Mr. Dupuis considers the\r\nevaporation as 4 millimetres per day.\r\n\r\nBetween Lake Tsana and Rosaires, on a length of about 750 kilometres the\r\nBlue Nile falls some 1260 metres; between Rosaires and Sennar, on a\r\nlength of 270 kilometres, it falls about 60 metres, and between Sennar\r\nand Khartoum on a length of 345 kilometres it falls about 50 metres. The\r\ncross sections of the river at Wad Medani, 200 kilometres above\r\nKhartoum, and at Khartoum are given on Plate IX.\r\n\r\nIn flood and early winter the river is navigable up to the Rosaires\r\ncataract. The width of channel may be considered as varying between 350\r\nand 700 metres with an average width of 500 metres. The river rises from\r\n9 to 12 metres in flood and has a velocity in high floods of 3 metres\r\nper second. Rivers with such velocities scour out their beds very\r\nseverely in high floods and deposit silt in low floods, and for the\r\ndischarges below 5 metres, cross sections should be annually established\r\nand discharge tables made depending on the sections. The summer\r\ndischarge varies from 100 to 300 cubic metres per second and the flood\r\nfrom 7,500 to 12,500 cubic metres per second. The behaviour of the river\r\nis shown in Tables 24 and 25. The beginning of May is generally low\r\nwater and the beginning of September high water. The winter discharge\r\nmay be taken as 500 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\nThe tributaries south of Rosaires are the following:--on the right bank,\r\nthe Folassa, the Durra, the Fatsam, the Bir and the Temsha, veritable\r\ntorrents; and on the left bank, numerous streams from north and\r\nnorth-west of Addis Ababa, the Anjur, and the Didessa, the latter from\r\n100 to 150 metres wide. North of the last is the Tumat. The Didessa is\r\nabout 350 kilometres long and the Tumat 200. It is not at all improbable\r\nthat in the valley of the Didessa far better reservoir sites could be\r\nfound than at Lake Tsana. Capt. Lyons tells me that there are important\r\nreaches here with very little slope. North of Rosaires there are two\r\nimportant tributaries on the right bank, the Dinder, north of Sennar,\r\nand the Rahad, just north of Wad Medani. Both these streams run only in\r\nflood and are dry in winter and summer. The Dinder has a bed width of\r\nabout 120 metres, depth 4 metres in good flood and a velocity of 2\r\nmetres per second, which gives a discharge of about 1000 cubic metres\r\nper second in a high flood. The Rahad has a bed width of 60 metres,\r\ndepth of 3 metres in a good flood and a velocity of 2 metres per second,\r\nwhich gives a discharge of 400 cubic metres per second in a good flood.\r\nThe deltas of the Blue Nile, the Dinder and the Rahad are formed of the\r\nrichest Nile mud. Such soil is rich in lime, potash and phosphates, but\r\nis poor in nitrates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII\r\n\r\nLith. Sup. Dep. Cairo.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLET OF LAKE TSANA\r\n\r\n_From a rough Survey_\r\n\r\nScale 1 : 30.000]\r\n\r\nThe velocity of the Blue Nile may be taken as 75 centimetres per second\r\nin low supply and 3 metres per second in high flood.\r\n\r\n\r\n20. =The Atbara.=--The Atbara river flows into the Nile at El-Damer,\r\nsouth of Berber. It is essentially a torrent fed by the rains of\r\nnorth-eastern Abyssinia. The rains here begin early and end early, so\r\nthat the Atbara is in high flood in August and falls quickly through\r\nSeptember. Its floods last from June to October and the river is dry for\r\nthe remaining months of the year. By dry it is meant that there is no\r\nrunning water, for the bed of the river contains numerous pools of\r\nwater, which are nearly always deep and often very extensive.\r\n\r\nMr. Dupuis has given a rough longitudinal section of the Atbara river.\r\nRising within 16 kilometres of Lake Tsana, at a height of about 2000\r\nmetres above sea level, in its first 300 kilometres it falls 1500 metres\r\nto 530 metres above sea level, where it is met by the Salaam river. In\r\nthe next hundred kilometres it falls 40 metres and is joined by the\r\nSettit river, a larger and more permanent stream than the Atbara itself.\r\nSixty kilometres lower down is the Khasm-el-Girba gauge, just upstream\r\nof Fasher and about 420 kilometres from the Nile. Two hundred kilometres\r\nbelow the Settit junction and about 280 kilometres from the Nile is\r\nGosrejeb, and 150 kilometres lower down Adarma. Finally, after a total\r\nlength of about 880 kilometres, the Atbara flows into the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Settit junction is about 490 metres above sea level, Fasher 470\r\nmetres, Gosrejeb 410, Adarma 380, and El-Damer about 365 metres above\r\nsea level. In the last 280 kilometres there is therefore a fall of 45\r\nmetres or about ¹⁄₆₀₀₀. In this reach the river has a width of about 330\r\nmetres and depth in flood of 6 metres.\r\n\r\nTables 24 and 25 give the behaviour of the river. In 1902 and 1904, two\r\nvery low years, the maximum discharge was about 2000 cubic metres per\r\nsecond, and in 1903 about 3000 cubic metres. In high floods the Atbara\r\ncan discharge 5000 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\nThe principal tributaries of the Atbara are the Salaam and Settit\r\nalready mentioned. On its right bank between Gosrejeb and Adarma it is\r\njoined by the Gaash river, which flows past Kassala and loses itself in\r\nthe deserts. In years of extraordinary rainfall the Gaash reaches the\r\nAtbara. The Gaash at Kassala has a width of 150 metres, depth of 1 metre\r\nand approximate discharge of 300 cubic metres per second in an ordinary\r\nflood. It has a course of about 160 kilometres before it disappears in\r\nthe desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. =The Nile from Khartoum to Assuân.=--The Nile begins its course\r\nwithout any gauge to record its varying height. A gauge north of\r\nOmdurman, another upstream of the 6th cataract and a third downstream of\r\nthe cataract are badly needed. Until these three gauges are erected and\r\nrecorded, and another erected and recorded on the Blue Nile at Kamlin,\r\nabout 100 kilometres above Khartoum, the behaviour of the Nile and its\r\ntributaries at their junction will never be exactly understood. Making\r\nuse of the information which is obtainable, we may say that the Blue\r\nNile is generally at its lowest between the 15th April and 15th May with\r\na mean low-water discharge of about 200 cubic metres per second, falling\r\nto nearly zero in certain years; it is at its highest between the 15th\r\nAugust and 15th September with a mean maximum discharge of some 10,000\r\ncubic metres per second, rising to 13,000 and falling to 6,500 in\r\nmaximum and minimum years. If the larger figure is correct, the Blue\r\nNile bank at Khartoum is over a metre too low, and the town is liable to\r\nbe flooded out. If reference is made to Plate VIII it will be seen that\r\nthe flood of the Blue Nile in July, August and September travels up the\r\nWhite Nile, holds back its waters and converts the valley of the White\r\nNile into a flood reservoir. When the Blue Nile falls rapidly in October\r\nand November, the discharge of the Nile is maintained by the stored-up\r\nwaters in the White Nile and by the White Nile flood which has slowly\r\ntravelled down its almost level bed. Table 24 shows this more clearly\r\nthan any description could. I do not think that the maximum discharge of\r\nthe Main Nile on any given day is ever equal to the maximum discharge of\r\nthe Blue Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Nile between Khartoum and Berber has a channel wider and deeper than\r\nthat between Wady Halfa and Assuân and a gentler current. I have not\r\ntaken, or seen any discharges which have been taken in this reach, but\r\njudging from what I saw I should say the channel was 800 metres wide on\r\nthe average. At a distance of 86 kilometres from Khartoum is the\r\nShabluka or 6th cataract. Here the Nile descends 6 metres on a length of\r\n18 kilometres. Two hundred and twenty kilometres below the cataract the\r\nAtbara flows into the Nile and repeats on a very small scale what the\r\nBlue Nile does at Khartoum. The Atbara is a flood torrent and is dry\r\nfrom October to May. In flood it discharges from a low maximum of 1,700\r\nto a high maximum of 5,000 cubic metres per second, with a mean maximum\r\nof 3,500 cubic metres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nBLUE & WHITE NILE GAUGES\r\n\r\nFLOOD OF 1903.\r\n\r\nBLUE & WHITE NILE GAUGES\r\n\r\nFLOOD OF 1904.\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.]\r\n\r\nIn this reach the Nile has a maximum range of 8¹⁄₂ metres and an\r\nordinary range of 7 metres.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four kilometres downstream of the Atbara junction is Berber, and\r\n45 kilometres downstream of Berber is the beginning of the 5th cataract,\r\nwhich has a length of 160 kilometres and a drop of 55 metres with three\r\nprincipal rapids, the Solimania, Baggâra and Mograt. The village of Abu\r\nHamed is situated at the foot of this Cataract. Between Abu Hamed and\r\nDongola is the 4th Cataract, which begins at a point 97 kilometres\r\ndownstream of Abu Hamed, and has a length of 110 kilometres with a drop\r\nof 49 metres. In this series of rapids are the Um Dâras and Guerendid.\r\nBetween the 4th and 3rd Cataracts is a reach of 313 kilometres on a\r\nslope ¹⁄₁₂₀₀₀. On this reach is the town of Dongola. The 3rd Cataract\r\nhas a length of 72 kilometres and a drop of 11 metres with the Hannek\r\nand Kaibâr rapids, surveyed and levelled by De Gottberg in 1857.\r\nUpstream of the Hannek rapid, on the left bank of the Nile, is the\r\ntermination of the long depression in the deserts which goes by the name\r\nof the Wady-el-Kab and is considered by many as lower than the Nile\r\nvalley. Between the 3rd and 2nd Cataracts is an ordinary reach of 118\r\nkilometres. West of this part of the Nile are the Selima Wells and\r\naccording to some travellers an old abandoned course of the Nile\r\nslightly above the present high level of the river. This waterless river\r\nis said to terminate in the Oasis of Berys which is separated from the\r\nKhargeh Oasis by a limestone ridge.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd Cataract, known as the “Batn-el-Haggar” or “Belly of Stone,” has\r\na length of 200 kilometres and a drop of 66 metres with the rapids of\r\nAmâra, Dal, Semna and Abka. At Semna are the rocks where Lepsius\r\ndiscovered the Nile gauges cut by one of the Pharaohs some 4,000 years\r\nago. The Nile flood recorded there is 8 metres higher than any flood of\r\nto-day. As the Nile at Semna could be very easily barred by a dam, it\r\nstruck me when I was there in 1892 that probably King Amenemhat (of Lake\r\nMœris fame) had tried to bar the river with a dam in the hope of\r\ncreating a reservoir. At Wady Halfa, near the foot of the 2nd Cataract,\r\na masonry gauge divided into metres has been erected and read since\r\n1877. Its accidental zero is R. L. 116.69 and the mean low-water level,\r\nor true zero, is R. L. 117.89. Between the 1st and 2nd Cataracts, the\r\nNile has a length of 345 kilometres and a slope of ¹⁄₁₂₅₀₀. The mean\r\nwidth of the river is 500 metres, and the mean depths in flood and\r\nsummer are 9 and 2 metres. The velocity in summer falls to 50\r\ncentimetres per second and rises to 2 metres per second in flood. The\r\nriver in this reach is generally within sandstone, and the greater part\r\nis provided with gigantic spurs on both banks. These spurs perform the\r\ndouble work of collecting soil on the sides in flood and training the\r\nriver in summer. They were probably put up by the great Rameses 3,000\r\nyears ago, as some of the most massive of them have evidently been\r\nconstructed to turn the river on a curve out of its natural channel on\r\nto the opposite side in order to secure deep water in front of Rameses’\r\ntemple of Jerf Husain (“Jerf” means steep, scoured bank). The spurs have\r\nbeen constructed with care, and as the courses of roughly-dressed stone\r\ncan be examined at fairly low water (I have never seen them at\r\nabsolutely low water) it is evident that there has been no great\r\ndegradation of the bed during the last 2,000 or 3,000 years. The first,\r\nor Assuân Cataract, has a drop of 5 metres on a length of 5 kilometres.\r\n\r\nFrom Khartoum to Assuân, on a total length of 1809 kilometres, there are\r\n565 kilometres of so-called cataracts with a total drop of 192 metres,\r\nand 1,244 kilometres of ordinary channel with a total drop of 103\r\nmetres.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the 1st Cataract is the Assuân dam, regulated on for the\r\nfirst time in October 1902. It has 140 openings of 2 metres × 7 metres\r\nand 40 openings of 2 metres × 3¹⁄₂ metres.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the 1st Cataract, opposite the town of Assuân, on the\r\nIsland of Elephantine, has stood a Nile gauge from very ancient times.\r\nAn officer belonging to the Roman garrison in the time of the Emperor\r\nSeverus marked an extraordinarily high flood on the gauge. The maximum\r\nflood-mark at the time of the visit of Napoleon’s French savants was\r\nhowever 2.11 metres higher than the above. As the middle of Severus’\r\nreign was A.D. 200, and the visit of French savants A. D. 1800, they\r\nconcluded that the bed and banks of the Nile had risen 2.11 metres in\r\n1600 years or 0.132 metres per 100 years. The new gauge divided into\r\ncubits and twenty-fourths was erected in 1869 and has been recorded\r\ndaily since then (a cubit = 54 centimetres). The accidental zero of the\r\ngauge is R. L. 84.16. The mean low-water level or true zero is R. L.\r\n85.00.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION OF THE NILE FROM WADY HALFA TO GEBEL SILSILAH\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.\r\n\r\nCROSS SECTION OF THE NILE VALLEY NEAR IBRÎM\r\n\r\nCROSS SECTION OF THE NILE VALLEY NEAR ASSUÂN\r\n\r\nTYPICAL CROSS SECTION UPSTREAM OF ASSUÂN DAM]\r\n\r\n\r\n22. =The Nile from Assuân to the Barrage.=--From Assuân to the Barrage,\r\nthe length of the river is 973 kilometres in summer and 923 in flood.\r\nThe slope in summer is ¹⁄₁₃₀₀₀ and in flood ¹⁄₁₂₂₀₀ The mean fall of the\r\nvalley is ¹⁄₁₀₈₀₀. The slopes vary in the different mean reaches, the\r\nleast being ¹⁄₁₄₈₀₀ in the Kena Mudiria and the greatest ¹⁄₁₁₄₀₀ in Beni\r\nSuef. In a high flood with a rise of 9 metres at Assuân, the rise in\r\nKena will be 9.5 metres and only 8.2 in Beni Suef. Table 42 gives the\r\nmean areas of cross sections of the Nile, while table 44 gives the mean\r\nwidths. Neglecting spill channels, we may state that in a high flood the\r\nmean area of the section of the Nile is 7,500 square metres and the mean\r\nwidth 900 metres. In the Kena Mudiria, the area is 7,000 square metres\r\nand the width 800 metres, while in Beni Suef the mean area is 8,000\r\nsquare metres and the mean width 1,000 metres. Speaking generally it may\r\nbe stated that where the Nile valley is narrow the slope of the river is\r\nsmall, its depth great and width contracted; while where the valley is\r\nbroad the slope is great, the depth small and the width enlarged. The\r\nmean velocity in flood ranges between 2.0 metres and 1.0 metre per\r\nsecond, while the velocity in summer varies from 0.5 to 0.9 metre per\r\nsecond. We may say that the Nile in soil has a natural section whose\r\nwidth in flood is 110 times its depth, while its mean velocity is 1.50\r\nmetres per second.\r\n\r\nThe natural canals, which take off the river and which never silt, have\r\na mean velocity of some 65 centimetres per second, while the proportion\r\nof width to depth is about 12 to 1. Artificial canals of this section do\r\nnot silt if their velocities are 80 centimetres per second, while\r\nsilting takes place as readily when the velocity is greater as when it\r\nis less than the above. In muddy streams, like the Nile in flood,\r\ncertain velocities demand certain proportions of width to depth, and if\r\nthese are not given to it, they will make it for themselves by eating\r\naway the sides if they can, or, if they cannot eat away the sides, by\r\nsilting up and raising the bed.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Assiout is situated the Assiout weir or barrage across\r\nthe Nile with 111 openings of 5 metres and 10 metres depth of water in\r\nhigh flood. It was regulated on for the first time in August 1902.\r\n\r\nOn Roda island, opposite Cairo, has stood a gauge from the earliest\r\ntimes. It has been frequently reconstructed. The present gauge is\r\nreputed to have been erected in A.D. 861 with its zero at the same level\r\nas a more ancient one whose readings have been preserved since A.D. 641.\r\nWhen the gauge was constructed, a reading of 16 cubits meant the lowest\r\nlevel at which flood irrigation could be insured everywhere. The level\r\nto-day is 20¹⁄₂ cubits on the gauge and the difference between them is\r\n1.22 metres. As 1,026 years have elapsed since the construction of the\r\ngauge it means a rise of 12 centimetres per 100 years. This is slightly\r\nunder the rise calculated at Assuân by the French savants.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the means of the maximum flood and low water\r\nlevels per century:--\r\n\r\n   7th century 17.5 R. L. flood 11.0 R. L. low water 6.5 Difference.\r\n   8th    „    17.4     „       11.1        „        6.3      „\r\n   9th    „    17.5     „       11.2        „        6.3      „\r\n  10th    „    17.5     „       11.3        „        6.2      „\r\n  11th    „    17.5     „       11.4        „        6.1      „\r\n  12th    „    17.7     „       11.5        „        6.2      „\r\n  13th    „    17.7     „       11.6        „        6.1      „\r\n  14th    „    17.9     „       11.7        „        6.2      „\r\n  15th    „    18.2     „       11.8        „        6.4      „\r\n  16th    „    18.4     „       11.9        „        6.5      „\r\n  17th    „    18.8     „       12.0        „        6.8      „\r\n  18th    „    19.1     „       12.1        „        7.1      „\r\n  19th    „    19.5     „       12.2        „        7.3      „\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above that the head of the Delta, or the\r\nbifurcation of the Nile, was much nearer to Cairo in early days than\r\njust now, and the last three centuries have seen great changes. The fall\r\nof watersurface is very considerable at every bifurcation, and the\r\ndifference between mean high and low supply at the Barrage to-day is 6.0\r\nmetres against 7.2 metres at Cairo. Judging from the above figures, I\r\nshould say that from the 7th to the 13th century the bifurcation was\r\ngradually approaching Cairo, while since the 13th it has been\r\nreceding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION OF THE NILE FROM ASSUAN TO CAIRO\r\n\r\nALONG CENTRE LINE OF FLOOD\r\n\r\nLith.

The\r\nhigh supply varies between 13,200 and 6,500 cubic metres per second,\r\nwith a mean of 10,000 cubic metres per second, while the low supply\r\nvaries between 350 and 1400 cubic metres per second with a mean of 590\r\ncubic metres per second. September is generally the highest month and\r\nMay the lowest. The mean low water level is R. L. 85.00.\r\n\r\nAt Cairo the Nile has a mean range of 7.00 metres with a maximum of 9.6\r\nmetres and a minimum of 5.3 metres. The high supply varies between\r\n12,000 and 4,800 cubic metres per second with a mean of 7,600 cubic\r\nmetres per second, while the low supply varies between 1,300 and 250\r\ncubic metres per second, with a mean of 500 cubic metres per second.\r\nOctober is the highest month and June the lowest. The mean low water\r\nlevel is at R. L. 12.25.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nCROSS SECTIONS OF THE NILE & ITS TRIBUTARIES\r\n\r\n_Horizontal Scale 1 : 2.000_\r\n\r\n_Vertical Scale 1 : 500_\r\n\r\nLith.

If, for example, it is known\r\nthat the water surface at any time of the year at Assiout is R. L.\r\n50.80, we know the mean low water by the Irrigation Department levels is\r\n45.05. The gauge is therefore 5.75, and by turning to Table 37 we know\r\nthe discharge.\r\n\r\nTable 37 gives the discharges of the river for gauges referred to the\r\nmean low water level. Between Esna and Kena the table is in excess of\r\nthe truth, and between Assiout and Beni-Suef it is slightly under. Taken\r\nall round the table is reliable, calculated from the means of hundreds\r\nof discharges and carefully prepared.\r\n\r\nTable 45 gives the slope of the water surface of the Nile in flood and\r\nin summer between Assuân and Cairo. Owing to the more winding track of\r\nthe low supply than of the flood waters, the former is 948 kilometres\r\nand the flood 900. The slope in summer is ¹⁄₁₃₀₀₀ and in high flood\r\n¹⁄₁₂₂₀₀.\r\n\r\nThe other tables need no explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. =The Rosetta and Damietta Branches.=--Plates XVII and XVIII give\r\nlongitudinal sections of the two branches of the Nile and their cross\r\nsections are given on Plate XI.\r\n\r\nDuring winter, summer, and low floods, regulation at the Barrage\r\ninterferes with the natural discharges of the two branches. The Damietta\r\nbranch is gradually silting up and decreasing in size, while the Rosetta\r\nbranch scours in high floods. The mean width of the Rosetta branch is\r\n500 metres, and the mean area of the section in flood is 4000 square\r\nmetres. The mean width of the Damietta branch is 270 metres and the mean\r\nsection 2700 square metres. The mean velocity of the floods range from\r\n1.00 metre to 1.60 metres per second. In summer the branches are\r\nhermetically closed at their heads and receive only the water which\r\nfilters into them from the subsoil. This in the Rosetta branch amounts\r\nto 20 cubic metres per second, and less in the Damietta branch. It may\r\nbe noted here that at Cairo the girder bridge at Kasr-el-Nil is 403\r\nmetres between the abutments and the smaller bridge is 178 metres,\r\nmaking a total width of 581 metres. The width of the Kafr Zayat bridge\r\non the Rosetta branch is 530 metres, while the old Benha bridge on the\r\nDamietta branch is 285 metres. The average depth of water in flood in\r\nthe two branches may be taken as 7 metres.\r\n\r\nThe barrage at the head of the Rosetta branch has 61 openings of 5\r\nmetres each and one lock 15 metres wide and the other 12 metres. They\r\nare all open in high flood. The Damietta barrage has 61 openings of 5\r\nmetres and one lock of 12 metres. The depth of water in a high flood is\r\n9 metres. The Rosetta barrage has 10 openings too few, and the Damietta\r\nbarrage 15 openings too many.\r\n\r\nBefore the construction of the Barrage in the middle of the 19th\r\ncentury, the maximum discharges of the two branches at the head of the\r\nDelta were nearly the same. A little lower down, however, the Rosetta\r\nbranch had considerably more water than the Damietta. About 2 kilometres\r\nbelow the Barrage there was a branch called the Shalakan branch which\r\nflowed from the Damietta into the Rosetta branch. About 20 kilometres\r\nbelow the Barrage, the Bahr Ferounieh took about ¹⁄₃ the total discharge\r\nof the Damietta branch and led it into the Rosetta branch. Both these\r\nwere closed by Mehemet Ali, while at the same time the Bahrs Sirsawiah,\r\nBaguria, Shebin, Khadrawiah, Moes, Um-Salama, Bohia and Sogair were also\r\ncompletely closed or provided with regulating heads, which very\r\nconsiderably diminished their discharge. During the time that they had\r\nbeen open the Damietta branch had lost water at every kilometre as it\r\napproached the sea, and though 400 metres wide at the head it had a\r\nchannel only 200 metres wide in its lower reaches. The Rosetta branch on\r\nthe other hand received the tail waters of many Bahrs and had only one\r\nescape, the Bahr Saidi near its tail.\r\n\r\nThe closing of so many escapes on the Damietta branch has caused this\r\nbranch in its upper reaches to carry so much water that its tail reaches\r\ncan not carry it without having the surface of the water raised\r\ninordinately and dangerously above the level of the country. An\r\nexamination of the longitudinal sections will show that while the\r\nRosetta branch in its middle reaches is from 1.50 to 2.00 metres above\r\nthe level of the country in a high flood, the Damietta branch is from\r\n2.50 to 3.00 metres. They will also show how the slope in the early\r\nreaches of the Damietta branch is considerably less than that in the\r\nearly reaches of the Rosetta branch, which results in the gradual\r\nsilting up of the former as already noted. The Karanain regulator at the\r\nhead of the old Bahr Shebin, taking from the Damietta branch below the\r\nBahr Ferouniah, was built in 1842 by Linant Pasha, with its wing wall 60\r\ncentimetres higher than any previous flood. By 1870 the Damietta branch\r\nhad risen 70 centimetres above the wing wall as measured by Linant\r\nPasha. In 1878, though the Damietta branch was relieved by the Gizeh\r\nbreach in the left bank of the Main Nile which drained into the Rosetta\r\nbranch, the flood water surface of the Damietta branch at Karanain was\r\n1.50 metres above the wing wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION OF THE ROSETTA BRANCH\r\n\r\n_Longitudinal Scale 1 : 100,000_\r\n\r\n_Vertical Scale 1 : 1,000_\r\n\r\n_Measurement along the right bank_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION OF THE DAMIETTA BRANCH\r\n\r\n_Longitudinal Scale 1 : 100,000_\r\n\r\n_Vertical Scale 1 : 1,000_\r\n\r\n_Measurement along the left bank_]\r\n\r\nThe maximum, minimum and mean floods in the Rosetta branch are 6,500,\r\n2,600 and 4,000 cubic metres per second. In the Damietta branch they are\r\n4,600, 1,300 and 2,300 cubic metres per second respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe utilisation of the Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. =The Nile in flood.=--We are now in a position to apply our\r\nknowledge of the Nile and its tributaries to an examination of the\r\nbehaviour of the rivers in flood and in time of low supply. Lake\r\nVictoria, the Victoria Nile, and Lake Albert may all be considered as\r\nthe great equatorial regulators of the Nile. The river, as a river,\r\nbegins at the outlet of Lake Albert, i.e., at the head of the Albert\r\nNile. Generally at its lowest in April, it rises gradually and reaches\r\nits maximum in November. The mean minimum of 600 cubic metres per second\r\nis gradually increased to its mean maximum of 900 cubic metres. The\r\nregulating effect of the lakes is very evident.\r\n\r\nBetween Lake Albert and Gondokoro the heavier rains begin late in April\r\nand with a break in June and July continue to November. The mean minimum\r\ndischarge of 600 cubic metres per second in April is increased by\r\nalternating rises and falls to the mean maximum of 1600 cubic metres per\r\nsecond in September, which has disappeared by the end of November, when\r\nthe water of Lake Albert alone remains in the river.\r\n\r\nThe Gazelle river in no way affects the flood or the low supply. Its\r\ngreat function is to maintain the levels of the great swamps between\r\nlatitudes 7° and 9°, saturate the soil, and prevent the complete\r\ndisappearance of the waters of the Albert Nile between January and May.\r\nThe functions this river performs are humble ones, but deprived of its\r\naid, the Nile north of Khartoum would frequently be dry in April and\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nThe Albert Nile at its tail just upstream of the mouth of the Sobat is\r\nat its lowest in April and May with a mean low discharge of 375 cubic\r\nmetres per second, when it is joined by the Sobat river with an\r\napproximate mean low discharge of 125 cubic metres per second; making a\r\njoint discharge for the head of the White Nile of 500 cubic metres per\r\nsecond as a mean minimum. Now begins one of the most interesting\r\noperations of any in the whole valley of the Nile, exceeded only in\r\ninterest by what happens at Khartoum lower down. The Albert Nile and the\r\nSobat river both rise together, the Albert Nile on a very gentle slope\r\nfreely overflowing its banks in the Sudd region, and the Sobat river\r\nconfined within its channel during its highest floods. The White Nile\r\nhas a very gentle slope, little carrying capacity and is quite incapable\r\nof taking on both floods. The water rises at the junction and the Sudd\r\nregion becomes a reservoir flooded to a depth of 3 metres. As the Sobat\r\nriver increases its discharge gradually from 75 cubic metres per second\r\nin April to 1000 cubic metres per second in October and November (for it\r\nis confined to its channel), the Albert Nile decreases the actual\r\ndischarge it sends down the White Nile and increases what it spreads\r\nover the Sudd region. The Albert Nile, having increased its quota for\r\nthe White Nile from 375 in April to 450 cubic metres per second in\r\nSeptember, gives less in October and November and gradually passes on\r\nits waters in December, January and February when the Sobat has fallen.\r\n\r\nThe White Nile at its head near Tewfikieh has its mean minimum of 500\r\ncubic metres per second in April, and increases slowly to its mean\r\nmaximum of 1500 cubic metres per second in December. During this\r\ninterval its water surface is raised by 3·50 metres. This water travels\r\nvery slowly on to Khartoum, where the mean minimum is 450 cubic metres\r\nper second in May, the slope is very insignificant, and the trough of\r\nthe river is 1500 metres wide.\r\n\r\nAt Khartoum the White Nile meets the Blue Nile. No greater contrast\r\nexists in the world. If maximum discharges are alone considered, the\r\nlittle finger of the Blue Nile is thicker than the loins of the White\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Nile is at its lowest on the 1st May with a mean minimum supply\r\nof 200 cubic metres per second rising to a mean maximum flood of 10,000\r\ncubic metres per second on the 1st September. The flood has fallen to\r\n2000 cubic metres per second by the middle of November.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of July the Blue and White Niles keep increasing their\r\ndischarges steadily at Khartoum, but after that date the Blue Nile gauge\r\nand discharge rise rapidly together, and the Blue Nile not only feeds\r\nthe Main Nile, but flows up the White Nile and arrests its discharge, so\r\nthat at Duem, 200 kilometres above Khartoum, the White Nile discharge\r\ndecreases in July and August while the Blue Nile is steadily flowing up\r\nthe White Nile valley and converting it into a reservoir for the Nile in\r\nwinter. It is only after the 15th September, when the Blue Nile has\r\nbegun to fall steadily and continuously that the White Nile discharge\r\nreally commences and reaches its mean maximum of some 2000 cubic metres\r\nper second in October.\r\n\r\nThe mean minimum discharge of the Nile of 650 cubic metres per second at\r\nKhartoum is obtained on the 1st May and the mean maximum of 9000 cubic\r\nmetres per second on the 1st September. Fed by the White Nile reservoir\r\nthe river falls comparatively slowly. Whether this peculiar relation of\r\nthe two rivers to each other could not be taken advantage of to increase\r\nthe supply in December, January and February, and decrease it in October\r\nand November by means of a regulating dam built across the White Nile at\r\nKhartoum is worthy of study.\r\n\r\nI greatly prefer the idea of storing the flood waters of the White Nile\r\nat Khartoum to any storage of the Albert Nile water above the junction\r\nof the Sobat river. A regulator above the Sobat junction would store up\r\na very considerable quantity of water, but the quality would be very\r\ndoubtful and possibly dangerous to health.\r\n\r\nAt El Damer, south of Berber, the Atbara flows into the Nile. Dry from\r\nJanuary to May, the flood begins in June and is at its maximum as a rule\r\nin the last week of August; with a mean high flood discharge of 3500\r\ncubic metres per second. This water cannot come on to Assuân without\r\nfilling up the 200 kilometres downstream of the 6th cataract where the\r\nslope of the Nile is gentle and the river lends itself to being used as\r\na reservoir. It is owing to the fact that none of the main feeders of\r\nthe Nile flow in immediately below cataracts that the rise and fall of\r\nthe Nile in Egypt, is so regular and constant. If the Sobat, Blue Nile\r\nand Atbara all flowed into the White or Main Niles below cataracts we\r\nshould have floods in Egypt whose sudden changes of level and\r\nfluctuations would be an unending source of danger to the country.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to the earliness of the Atbara high flood and the\r\ncomparative lateness of the Nile high flood, that the ordinary maximum\r\ndischarge of the Nile at Assuân is only 10,000 cubic metres per second.\r\nThis is generally on the 5th September. When the monsoon is early the\r\nmaximum at Assuân is reached before or on the 5th September; when the\r\nmonsoon is late the maximum is reached about the 20th September. An\r\nearly maximum at Assuân is generally followed by a low summer, while a\r\nlate maximum is generally followed by a high summer supply. Only once\r\nhas this rule been broken and that was in 1891 when there were two\r\nmaxima, one on the 4th September and another on the 27th. In this year\r\nthere must have been an extraordinary fall of rain in Abyssinia in\r\nSeptember, for the flood of the 27th September was very muddy, while as\r\na rule the river at Assuân is very muddy in August, less so in\r\nSeptember, still less so in October and much less in November when the\r\nWhite Nile is the ruling factor in the supply of the river.\r\n\r\nIf the September rains in Abyssinia are very heavy, an ordinary flood\r\npasses Assuân at the end of September and is disastrous for Egypt. This\r\nhappened in 1878. Table 26 contains details of this flood, of the\r\nminimum flood year 1877 and the mean of the 20 years from 1873 to 1892.\r\n\r\nAt Assuân the Nile enters Egypt, and it now remains to consider it in\r\nits last 1,200 kilometres. The mean minimum discharge at Assuân is 590\r\ncubic metres per second and is reached about the end of May. The river\r\nrises slowly till about the 20th July and then rapidly through August,\r\nreaching its maximum about the 5th September, and then falling very\r\nslowly through October and November. The deep perennial irrigation\r\ncanals take water all the year round, but the flood irrigation canals\r\nare closed with earthen banks till the 15th August, and are then all\r\nopened. These flood canals, of which there are some 45, are capable of\r\ndischarging 2,000 cubic metres per second at the beginning of an\r\nordinary year, 3,600 cubic metres per second in a maximum year, and have\r\nan immediate effect on the discharge of the Nile. The channel of the\r\nNile itself and its numerous branches and arms consume a considerable\r\nquantity of water (the cubic contents of the trough of the Nile between\r\nAssuân and Cairo are 7,000,000,000 cubic metres), the direct irrigation\r\nfrom the Nile between Assuân and Cairo takes 50 cubic metres per second,\r\n130 cubic metres per second are lost by evaporation off the Nile, and\r\n400 cubic metres per second by absorption. Owing to all these different\r\ncauses, there is the net result that, from August 15th to October 1st,\r\nthe Nile is discharging 2,400 cubic metres per second less at Cairo than\r\nAssuân. During October and November the flood canals are closed, and the\r\nbasins which have been filled in August and September discharge back\r\ninto the Nile, and in October the Nile at Cairo is discharging 900 cubic\r\nmetres per second in excess of the discharge at Assuân and 500 cubic\r\nmetres per second in excess in November.\r\n\r\nThe mean minimum discharge at Cairo is 500 cubic metres per second and\r\nis attained on the 15th of June; the river rises slowly through July and\r\nfairly quickly in August, and reaches its ordinary maximum on the 1st\r\nOctober when the basins are full and the discharge from the basins is\r\njust beginning. The ordinary maximum discharge at Cairo is about 7,600\r\ncubic metres per second. Through October the Nile at Cairo is\r\npractically stationary, and falls rapidly in November.\r\n\r\nNorth of Cairo are the heads of the perennial canals which irrigate the\r\nDelta proper. The canals, with their feeders lower down, discharge 1,200\r\ncubic metres per second, and the ordinary maximum flood at Cairo of\r\n7,600 cubic metres per second is reduced by this amount between Cairo\r\nand the sea. Of the 6,400 cubic metres per second which remain, 4,100\r\ncubic metres per second find their way to the sea down the Rosetta\r\nbranch, and 2,300 cubic metres per second down the Damietta branch.\r\nDuring extraordinary floods the Damietta branch has discharged 4,300\r\ncubic metres per second and the Rosetta branch 7,000 cubic metres per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. =The Nile in low supply.=--We have so far considered the Nile in\r\nflood, it now remains to quickly dispose of the low supply. After\r\nreaching its maximum, the Atbara, which is a torrential river, falls\r\nmore rapidly than others, and by the end of September has practically\r\ndisappeared; after the middle of September the Blue Nile falls quickly,\r\nwhile the White Nile with its large basin, gentle flow and numerous\r\nreservoirs, falls very deliberately. The mean minimum discharge of the\r\nWhite Nile at Gondokoro in an ordinary year, at the time of low supply,\r\nis 600 cubic metres per second. Of the Sobat river it is 100 cubic\r\nmetres per second. By the time the water reaches Khartoum it is reduced\r\nto 450 cubic metres per second. The mean low supply of the Blue Nile is\r\n200 cubic metres per second, giving a mean low supply to the Nile at\r\nKhartoum of 650 cubic metres per second. The Atbara supplies nothing.\r\nBetween Khartoum and Assuân there is a further loss of 60 cubic metres\r\nper second, and the mean low supply delivered at Assuân is 590 cubic\r\nmetres per second. In very bad years the discharge at Assuân has fallen\r\nto 400 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\nLombardini was no untrue prophet when he wrote that he was convinced\r\nthat the more carefully the discharges were taken and the results known,\r\nthe more would engineers be astonished at the extraordinary amount of\r\nthe subsoil water which filtered into the Nile from the head of the\r\nWhite Nile to the sea, and which gave back to the Nile in the months of\r\ndeflux of the river, the water which had percolated into the soil during\r\nthe afflux. He predicted that heavy as the evaporation was in April, May\r\nand June in the Nile valley, the influx of subsoil water would be found\r\nto counterbalance it. When we calculate the extent of the water used in\r\nirrigation along the course of the Nile, and compare the discharges at\r\nTewfikieh, Khartoum, Assuân, Cairo and at the tails of the Rosetta and\r\nDamietta branches during the time of low supply we can only admire the\r\nperspicacity of the greatest hydraulic engineer of the last century.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. =Nile water.=--For the following information I am principally\r\nindebted to M. J. Barois’ “Les irrigations en Egypte” just published,\r\nand to an article by Mr G. P. Foaden in the Journal of the Khedivial\r\nAgricultural Society for January 1903. The colour of Nile water is\r\ngenerally a pale yellow, but in June, when the first indications of the\r\ncoming flood are given by a continuous gentle rise of the river from its\r\nminimum gauge, the water changes to green and remains so for two or\r\nthree weeks. This green water has a very disagreeable taste and odour,\r\nand is especially objectionable when the Nile has been very low and the\r\nrise is a slow one. In June 1900 it was extraordinarily bad, and the\r\nriver water was so poor in oxygen that standing on Kasr-el-Nil bridge at\r\nCairo one could see the surface of the water covered with fish which\r\napparently could only live near the surface. In the deep reaches near\r\nKalabsha in Nubia, the fish died in myriads. This green water is\r\nattributed by some to the immense amount of vegetable matter brought\r\ndown by the White Nile from the Sudd region. Some say that it comes\r\nprincipally with the first rise of the Sobat river. But the generally\r\naccepted theory to-day is that the green water is the result of\r\nvegetable growths from germs is the water itself, and that wherever or\r\nwhenever the current becomes exceedingly slack they multiply greatly.\r\nUpstream of the Assuân dam in June 1903 the water was extraordinarily\r\ngreen and exceedingly objectionable. As it was shot out of the upper\r\nsluices of the dam and broken up into spray on the downstream side of\r\nthe dam it became so purified that I found it difficult to understand\r\nthat the water flowing past Elephantine Island was what I had seen at\r\nShellal. The green water is followed by the red water of the Nile flood,\r\nwhich has always thoroughly established itself at Cairo by the 1st of\r\nAugust. This red water comes from the scourings of the volcanic plateau\r\nof Abyssinia by the Blue Nile and the Atbara. Rich in mud and rich in\r\nmanures, this red water is the creator of Egypt. Egypt is nothing more\r\nthan the deposit left by the Nile in flood. The water is most heavily\r\ncharged with detritus in August, less in September, and still less in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nMany analyses have been made of Nile water. Following M. Barois, I place\r\nside by side the analysis of Dr. Letheby of 1874⁄75 and Dr. Mackenzie\r\nof 1896/97/98. The year 1874 was an extraordinarily high flood.\r\n\r\n  =========+==============================\r\n   Month.  | PARTS IN 100,000 OF WATER\r\n           +----------+--------+----------\r\n           |    Dr.   |   Dr.  |The Mean\r\n           |Mackenzie.|Letheby.|of the two\r\n  ---------+----------+--------+----------\r\n  January  |   31·0   |  16·7  |   27·4\r\n  February |   25·3   |  12·6  |   22·1\r\n  March    |   12·7   |   5·3  |   10·9\r\n  April    |   15·8   |   6·6  |   13·5\r\n  May      |   14·7   |   4·8  |   12·2\r\n  June     |   14·1   |   6·9  |   12·3\r\n  July     |   13·9   |  17·8  |   14·8\r\n  August   |  159·0   | 149·2  |  156·6\r\n  September|  156·1   |  53·3  |  130·4\r\n  October  |  110·0   |  37·8  |   92·8\r\n  November |   70·8   |  34·4  |   61·7\r\n  December |   47·0   |  28·9  |   42·4\r\n  ---------+----------+--------+----------\r\n    Mean   |   56·0   |  31·3  |   49·8\r\n  =========+==========+========+==========\r\n\r\nFrom this last column M. Barois concludes that in high floods\r\n100,000,000 tons of solid matter pass Assuân, and 88,000,000 in mean\r\nfloods. It is unfortunate that we have no analyses of low floods like\r\n1877, 88, 99, 1902 and 1904 which were extraordinarily muddy. The water\r\nhad little sand but much mud. The sand is scoured out of the bed of the\r\nriver itself in high floods.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Letheby the composition of Nile deposit is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  =========================+=========+==============\r\n                           |In flood.|In low supply.\r\n                           +---------+--------------\r\n  Organic matter           |  15·02  |    10·37\r\n  Phosphoric acid          |   1·78  |      ·57\r\n  Lime                     |   2·06  |     3·18\r\n  Magnesia                 |   1·12  |      ·99\r\n  Potash                   |   1·82  |     1·06\r\n  Soda                     |    ·91  |      ·62\r\n  Alumina and oxide of iron|  20·92  |    23·55\r\n  Silica                   |  55·09  |    58·22\r\n  Carbonic acid and loss   |   1·28  |     1·44\r\n  -------------------------+---------+--------------\r\n         Total             | 100·00  |   100·00\r\n  =========================+=========+==============\r\n\r\nComparative analyses of subsoil water in Egypt and Nile water in time of\r\nlow supply are given below.\r\n\r\n  =================================+========================\r\n                                   |    PARTS IN 100,000\r\n      Dissolved matter.            +-----------+------------\r\n                                   |Well water.|Summer water\r\n                                   |           |  in Nile.\r\n  ---------------------------------+-----------+------------\r\n  Lime                             |   16·56   |   4·24\r\n  Magnesia                         |    4·53   |   1·00\r\n  Soda                             |    8·20   |   6·20\r\n  Potash                           |     ·37   |   1·44\r\n  Chlorine                         |   13·60   |    ·67\r\n  Sulphuric acid                   |    5·93   |   2·16\r\n  Nitric acid                      |     ·17   |   --Traces\r\n  Silica, alumina and oxide of iron|    1·80   |    ·97\r\n  Organic Matters                  |     ·60   |   1·75\r\n  Carbonic oxide and loss          |   12·26   |   4·03\r\n  ---------------------------------+-----------+------------\r\n                                   |   64·02   |  22·46\r\n  =================================+===========+============\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Nile water in the time of low supply consists\r\nin a very appreciable part of subsoil water which has filtered into the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nMr. Foaden states that, speaking in round numbers, we may say that Nile\r\ndeposit in flood contains\r\n\r\n  Nitrogen           ·1 per cent\r\n  Phosphoric acid    ·2    „\r\n  Potash             ·6    „\r\n\r\nHe values the manure deposited by the Nile annually in a well irrigated\r\nbasin at £·75. He concludes that Nile water in flood is rich in potash,\r\nfairly rich in phosphoric acid and poor in nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n27. =The soil of the Nile valley.=--According to numerous analyses made\r\nof Egyptian soil in 1872 by MM. Payen, Champion and Gastinel, the soil\r\nof Egypt consists of\r\n\r\n  Silica              45         per cent\r\n  Argile              53            „\r\n  Magnesia             ·2 to 1·6    „\r\n  Lime                1·3 to 4·9    „\r\n  Nitrogen            ·03 to ·10    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid     ·03 to ·32    „\r\n\r\nSome stiff soils contain 84 per cent argile and some light soils contain\r\n68 per cent sand. As one approaches the Mediterranean the quantity of\r\nchloride of soda increases and runs from a fraction to 4, 5, and even 10\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nFrom the means of ten samples of soil from Kena Mudirieh analysed for me\r\nin May by Mr. Frank Hughes of the Agricultural Society we gather that\r\nthe constituents of the soil are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  =====================================+======+======+=======\r\n  Ingredients.                         |Max %.|Min %.|Mean %.\r\n  -------------------------------------+------+------+-------\r\n  Silica etc., insoluble in strong acid|66    |53    |60\r\n  Total Lime                           | 3·80 | 2·50 | 3·34\r\n  Total Potash                         | 1·19 |  ·46 |  ·74\r\n  Total Potash available               |  ·072|  ·020|  ·042\r\n  Total Phosphoric Acid                |  ·49 |  ·20 |  ·35\r\n  Total Phosphoric available           |  ·090|  ·029|  ·066\r\n  Carbonic Acid = Chalk                | 3·52 | 1·79 | 2·69\r\n  Nitrogen                             |  ·106|  ·056|  ·084\r\n  =====================================+======+======+======\r\n\r\nWe have here a general sufficiency of phosphoric acid, plenty of potash\r\nand lime, and a low proportion of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe salts of the soil, when in excess, are chlorides and sulphates of\r\nsoda: the carbonates are present in very small quantities indeed.\r\n\r\nThe following selection from a paper by Mr. Lang Anderson in the\r\nDecember 1903 number of the Journal of the Khedivial Agricultural\r\nSociety is interesting.\r\n\r\n“Voelcker’s analyses of the two samples of soil taken from the drained\r\nbed of what was Lake Edku near Alexandria give the following results:--\r\n\r\n  ============================+=======+=======\r\n                              | No. 1.| No. 2.\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------\r\n  Oxide of iron               | 11·69 | 11·04\r\n  Iron pyrites                |  0·08 |  0·11\r\n  Aluminium                   |  6·36 | 10·88\r\n  Lime                        |  2·08 |  7·73\r\n  Magnesia                    |  1·79 |  0·93\r\n  Soda                        |  0·79 |   ..\r\n  Sodium chloride             |  8·11 |  8·56\r\n  Potash                      |  0·65 |  1·23\r\n  Sulphuric acid              |  2·23 |  2·56\r\n  Carbonic acid               |  0·19 |  4·75\r\n  Phosphoric acid             |  0·16 |  0·19\r\n  Insoluble silicates and sand| 62·23 | 45·81\r\n  Organic matter              |  3·64 |  6·21\r\n                              |       |\r\n                       Total  |100·00 |100·00\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------\r\n  Containing nitrogene        |  0·035|  0·070\r\n      „      ammonia          |  0·042|  0·079”\r\n  ============================+=======+=======\r\n\r\n\r\n28. =Basin irrigation.=--Considering the times of flood and low supply,\r\nthe climate of Egypt, the turbidity of the Nile flood, and the deltaic\r\nformation of the Nile valley, no better system than basin irrigation as\r\npracticed in Egypt could possibly have been devised. If the flood had\r\ncome in April and May and been followed by a burning summer, or if the\r\nactual autumn floods had been followed by the frozen winters of Europe\r\nor the warm winters of the Sudan, basin irrigation would have been a\r\nfailure or a very moderate success; but, given the Egyptian climate,\r\nbasin irrigation has stood without a rival for 7000 years.\r\n\r\nBasin irrigation, as it has been practised in Egypt for thousands of\r\nyears, is the most efficacious method of utilising existing means of\r\nirrigation which the world has witnessed. It can be started by the\r\nsparsest of populations. It will support in wealth a multitude of\r\npeople. King Menes made his first dyke when the Egyptian nation was in\r\nits infancy. Egypt, in Roman times, supported a population twice as\r\ndense as that of to-day. The direct labour of cultivation is reduced to\r\nan absolute minimum.\r\n\r\nShakespeare’s genius has crystallised the system for all time:--\r\n\r\n        “They take the flow o’ the Nile\r\n    By certain scales in the Pyramid; they know,\r\n    By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth\r\n    Or foizon follow: the higher Nilus swells,\r\n    The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman\r\n    Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,\r\n    And shortly comes to harvest.”\r\n\r\nIf we cast back our view to the dawn of Egyptian history, we can picture\r\nthe Nile Valley as consisting of arid plains, sand dunes, and marshy\r\njungles, with reclaimed enclosures on all the highest lands. Every eight\r\nor ten years the valley was swept by a mighty inundation. The seeds of\r\nfuture success lay in the resolve of King Menes’ engineers to confine\r\ntheir attention to one bank of the river alone. It was the left bank of\r\nthe river which history tells us was first reclaimed. A longitudinal\r\ndyke was run parallel to the stream, and cross dykes tied it to the\r\nLybian hills. Into these basins or compartments the turbid waters of the\r\nflood were led by natural water-courses and artificial canals and\r\nallowed to deposit their rich mud and thoroughly saturate the soil; and\r\nmeantime the whole of the right bank and the trough of the river itself\r\nwere allowed to be swept by the floods. It must have been on this wild\r\neastern bank that were conducted all the hippopotamus hunts which are\r\ncrowded on the wall pictures of buildings of the early dynasties. In all\r\nprobability, the first six dynasties contented themselves with\r\ndeveloping the left bank of the Nile. As, however, the population\r\nincreased, and with it the demand for new lands, it became necessary to\r\nreclaim the right bank of the river as well. The task now was doubly\r\ndifficult, as the river had to be confined to its own trough. This\r\nmasterful feat was performed by the great Pharaohs of the XIIth Dynasty,\r\nthe Amenemhats and the Usartsens, who, under the name of Sesostris,\r\nusurped the place of Menes in the imagination of the ancient world. They\r\nwere too well advised to content themselves with repeating on the right\r\nbank what Menes had done on the left. By suddenly confining the river\r\nthey would have exposed the low-lying lands of Memphis and Lower Egypt\r\nto disastrous inundations. To obviate this, they widened and deepened\r\nthe natural channel which led to the Fayoum depression in the Lybian\r\nhills, and converted it into a powerful escape to carry off the excess\r\nwaters of high floods; and so successful were they in their undertakings\r\nthat the conversion of the Fayoum depression into Lake Mœris was long\r\nconsidered by the ancient world as one of its greatest wonders. They led\r\nthe flood into the depression when it was dangerously high, and provided\r\nfor its return to the river when the inundation had come to an end. By\r\nthis means, they insured the lake against being at a high level during a\r\nperiod of flood. The gigantic dykes of entry and exit were only cut in\r\ntimes of emergency, and were reconstructed again at an expense of labour\r\nwhich even an Egyptian Pharaoh considered excessive. To understand how\r\ncapable Lake Mœris was to control the floods, and turn a dangerous into\r\na beneficial inundation, I should recommend a study of Sir Hanbury\r\nBrown’s “Fayoum and Lake Mœris.” As years rolled on the Nile widened and\r\ndeepened its own trough, to which it was now confined; and, eventually,\r\nthe time came when Lake Mœris could be dispensed with without danger. It\r\nwas gradually reclaimed and converted into the Fayoum with its 350,000\r\nacres of cultivated land.\r\n\r\nBasin irrigation holds the flood waters for some 45 days per annum over\r\nthe whole of the valley. The water is in places 3 metres deep, and in\r\nothers only 30 centimetres deep, while the average depth is about 1\r\nmetre. Now the retention of this water over the land for a period of six\r\nweeks permits of the thorough saturation of the subsoil in places where\r\nthe subsoil is of proper consistency; and this water can be drawn on, in\r\nwinter and summer, for maturing certain crops and growing others. It was\r\nwhere the subsoil gave a plentiful supply of water, and permitted of\r\nintense cultivation throughout the year, that we find all the ancient\r\ncapitals of Egypt. Abydos has the finest subsoil water in the Nile\r\nValley; Memphis has an excellent supply; while Thebes has the only good\r\nsubsoil water on the whole of the right bank. Good subsoil water was to\r\nthe ancient Egyptian world what the presence of a rich gold mine is to\r\none of our new colonies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN XIV\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH SOHAG SYSTEM OF BASINS\r\n\r\n_Scale 1 : 200,000_\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.]\r\n\r\nSubsoil water supplies the link between basin and perennial irrigation.\r\nIt explains the reason why modern Egypt is not satisfied with the\r\nirrigation which has come down from the remotest antiquity, but is\r\ndesirous of conferring on the length and breadth of the Nile Valley\r\nthose advantages which gave Abydos, Memphis, and Thebes their\r\npre-eminence in the past. Any country which possesses rivers and streams\r\nwhose waters are in flood for six weeks per annum at a suitable season\r\nof the year can betake itself to basin irrigation with more or less\r\nprofit. The science of dams, weirs, and regulators has received such\r\ndevelopment during recent years that there can be no problem so\r\ndifficult that it cannot be solved by experience and originality. Basin\r\nirrigation allows of the thorough development of countries whose streams\r\nhave short and turbid floods which precede a fairly cool season; whether\r\nsuch irrigation be the stately irrigation of the Nile Valley, perfected\r\nby the science and experience of 7,000 years; or the less perfect, but\r\nstill highly developed and river-fed tank systems of Madras; or the\r\nprimitive, but effective basins of Bundelkund, where the impounded water\r\nirrigates the crops on the down-stream sides of the basins for one\r\nseason, and then allows of the basins themselves being dried and\r\ncultivated in the next.\r\n\r\nThe Nile in high flood rises 10 metres above its bed, in a mean flood 9\r\nmetres and in a poor flood 7¹⁄₂ metres. The beds of the main basin\r\ncanals are about 4¹⁄₂ metres, and the cultivated land at the river’s\r\nedge about 9 metres above the river-bed. The basins have an average area\r\nof 7,000 acres. Where the valley is narrow, they average 2,000 acres\r\neach, and where it is wide 20,000 acres; while some of the tail basins\r\nare 40,000 acres in extent. Each canal has about seven or eight basins\r\ndepending on it, of which the last is always the largest. There are\r\nmasonry regulators at the canal heads, at each crossing of the cross\r\nbanks, and at the tail escapes into the river. In the more perfect\r\nbasins the canals and escapes syphon under one another and overlap and\r\nsupply each other’s deficiencies, so as to meet the requirements of\r\nevery kind of flood which Egypt can experience. Colonel Ross’s work on\r\nthe basin irrigation of Egypt is a monument of patient observation and a\r\nstorehouse of information. Some of the canals like the Sohagia on Plate\r\nXIV are veritable rivers, discharging 450 cubic metres per second; but a\r\ngood average canal discharges 30 cubic metres per second. The largest\r\ncanal has a width of 75 metres, while the average width is 9 metres.\r\nGood basin canals discharge in an average year one cubic metre per\r\nsecond per 700 acres. Forty-five days suffice for a perfect irrigation.\r\nThe cost of providing basin irrigation in Egypt for basins of 10,000\r\nacres may be taken at £3 per acre thus made up:--Banks, £1·50.; canals,\r\n£·75.; masonry works, £·50.; and bank protection, £·25. If the basins\r\nare under 5,000 acres, the cost will be nearly double this. The annual\r\ncost of maintenance is £·10 per acre; while the lands themselves are\r\nrented at £3 per acre. In well irrigated basins no manures are needed,\r\nand alternate crops of cereals and legumins have been reaped for\r\ncenturies without the land having been exhausted in any way whatever.\r\nWhere the subsoil water is good and double cropping resorted to, then\r\nmanures have to be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n29. =Perennial Irrigation.=--The foundation-stone of the conversion of\r\nthe whole of Egypt from basin to perennial irrigation was laid by\r\nMehemet Ali in 1833, when he began the construction of the Barrages\r\nacross the Nile branches north of Cairo. These weirs were intended to\r\nraise the summer level of the Nile by 3 metres. As the ordinary summer\r\nlevel of the Nile was 1.50 metres above its bed, the weirs were expected\r\nto raise it 4.50 metres above the Nile bed. The old basin canals had to\r\nbe considerably deepened to take in the summer supplies; while in other\r\nparts new perennial canals were dug. Perennial irrigation requires\r\ncanals capable of discharging 1 cubic metre per second per 3500 acres,\r\nas against 700 acres for basin irrigation. Some of the perennial canals\r\nare very capacious. The two largest discharge 700 and 450 cubic metres\r\nper second respectively. There are no artificial canals in the world\r\nlike them. All the canals are liberally provided with regulators and\r\nlocks. The energies of the Irrigation Department during the last ten\r\nyears have been chiefly directed to the provision of sufficient drains\r\nto meet that over-saturation of the soil, which all but the best\r\nregulated perennial irrigation invariably entails. After many years’\r\nexperience in India and Egypt, we are convinced that the construction of\r\ndrains and escapes should precede, and not follow the canals. It seems\r\nfatuous for engineers to be always over-saturating and half-ruining tens\r\nof thousands of acres of low-lying lands, during the improvement of\r\nhundreds of thousands of acres of high-lying lands, when it would be\r\nperfectly easy, with a little foresight, to secure all the advantages\r\nwithout piling up disadvantages. The drains have generally one-third the\r\ncapacity of the canals. Dry crops require 1 cubic metre per second per\r\n3500 acres; and rice requires the same per 2000 acres. The drains in\r\ndry-cropped lands provide for 1 cubic metre per second per 10,000 acres,\r\nand in rice lands 1 cubic metre per second per 6000 acres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\nPERENNIAL CANAL SYSTEM OF LOWER EGYPT\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.]\r\n\r\nWhile basin irrigation is followed by the winter crops of wheat, beans,\r\nclover, barley, flax, lentils, vetches and onions, perennial irrigation\r\nallows of all the above winter crops and in addition the summer crops of\r\ncotton, sugar-cane, oilseeds, gardens and orchards. It will readily be\r\nunderstood that all this double cropping necessitates a very free use of\r\nmanures.\r\n\r\nIt would be a healthy innovation indeed, if the provision of suitable\r\nmanures were to be considered as an essential part of a project for\r\nproviding perennial irrigation. The day is not far distant, I believe,\r\nwhen governments which provide irrigation works will also provide\r\nmanures, and sell the water and the manures together, one being as\r\nessential as the other; I know well, from observation, that a\r\nwell-manured field needs only half the water that a poorly manured field\r\ndoes; and in years of drought and scarcity manures almost take the place\r\nof irrigation. Why should there not be a manure-rate as well as a\r\nwater-rate? Here in Egypt, the numerous ruins of old-world cities have\r\nhitherto provided manure for a great part of the perennially irrigated\r\nlands; but these are being fast worked out, and other sources must be\r\nsought for. Farm-yard manure will never suffice for the intense\r\ncultivation in this country. In connection with this subject, I can\r\nrecommend the study of a remarkably able paper on “Nile Cultivation and\r\nNitrates,” read by Mr. J. B. Fuller, C.I.E., before the Agricultural\r\nSociety of England, and embodied in the 3rd Series, Vol. VII., Part 4,\r\n1896. Egypt possesses, in the vicinity of Luxor, natural beds of\r\nnitrates of unlimited extent, which come down to the river’s edge. These\r\nnitrate beds have been used from time immemorial, but were brought to\r\nthe notice of the general public by Mr. Floyer. They contain only about\r\n6 per cent. of pure nitrates, but as they are on the edge of the Nile,\r\nin a perfectly cloudless and very dry country, it might be possible,\r\nwith the aid of the plentiful supply of water always at hand to\r\nprofitably extract pure nitrates. The demand for nitrates is without\r\nlimit in the Nile Valley, as Nile water, though rich in everything else,\r\nis exceedingly poor in nitrates.\r\n\r\nThe perennial canals and collateral works have cost £4.50 per acre, and\r\nthe maintenance charges are £·10 per acre. The perennially irrigated\r\nlands are let at £5 to £8 per acre per annum as against £3 to £5 for the\r\nbasins lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n30. =Flood protection in Egypt.=--The Nile during high floods is\r\nconsiderably above the level of the country, which is protected by\r\nembankments stretching from Assouân to the sea. In Upper Egypt, a very\r\nhigh flood is one metre above the country; in Middle Egypt it is 2\r\nmetres, and the same on the Rosetta branch of the Nile. On the Damietta\r\nbranch it is 3·50 metres in places.\r\n\r\nIn parts of Upper Egypt, but nearly everywhere in Lower Egypt, the Nile\r\non curves is protected by stone spurs. These spurs contain each from\r\n4,000 to 250 cubic metres. They are very effective where the Nile bank\r\nhas been well thrown back below them to a distance of some 50 metres on\r\na length of at least 100 metres. This allows the waters of the flood to\r\nswirl harmlessly in whirlpools below the spurs while the banks are far\r\nremoved from their action.\r\n\r\nWhen we first came to Egypt, we found that the policy was to spread the\r\nflood into as many channels as possible and protect the whole of them\r\nwith tens of thousands of corvée, in addition to the corvée on the Nile\r\nbanks. We changed that and concentrated our energies on the Rosetta and\r\nDamietta branches.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, 1863, 1866, 1869, 1874, and 1878 the Damietta branch was badly\r\nbreached, There has been only one serious breach on the Rosetta branch,\r\nand that was in 1863. The great breach of 1878 on the Damietta branch\r\nwas attended with serious loss of life; but far more serious was the\r\nbreach of 1863 on the Rosetta branch not far from its head. The whole\r\nwestern half of the Delta proper was swept by the river, and as the\r\ncanals there have not got good high banks, the people had no place of\r\nshelter to flee to and were drowned in very great numbers. The same\r\nthing would happen again if a breach were to occur now, only the damage\r\nwould be far more serious. The country is covered with villas and rich\r\nplantations and the low lands to the very edges of Lake Borrilos are\r\nbeing reclaimed and inhabited. The loss of life which would occur\r\nnowadays would be truly appalling. A breach anywhere within 100\r\nkilometres of the Barrage on the east bank of the Rosetta branch or the\r\nwest bank of the Damietta branch during a very high flood would be a\r\nnational disaster.\r\n\r\nThe terror reigning over the whole country during a very high flood is\r\nvery striking. The Nile banks are covered with booths at intervals of 50\r\nmetres. Each booth has two watchmen, and lamps are kept burning all\r\nnight. Every dangerous spot has a gang of 50 or 100 special men. The\r\nNile is covered with steamers and boats carrying sacks, stakes, and\r\nstone; while the banks along nearly their entire length are protected by\r\nstakes supporting cotton and Indian corn stalks, keeping the waves off\r\nthe loose earth of the banks. In a settlement of a culvert in the Nile\r\nbank north of Mansourah in 1887 I witnessed a scene which must have once\r\nbeen more common than it is to-day. The news that the bank had breached\r\nspread fast through the village. The villagers rushed out on to the\r\nbanks with their children, their cattle, and everything they possessed.\r\nThe confusion was indescribable. A narrow bank covered with buffaloes,\r\nchildren, poultry, and household furniture. The women assembled round\r\nthe local saint’s tomb, beating their breasts, kissing the tomb, and\r\nuttering loud cries, and every five minutes a gang of men running into\r\nthe crowd and carrying off the first thing they could lay hands on\r\nwherewith to close the breach. The fellaheen meanwhile, in a steady,\r\nbusiness-like manner, plunged into the breach, stood shoulder to\r\nshoulder across the escaping water, and with the aid of torn-off doors\r\nand windows and Indian corn stalks, closed the breach. They were only\r\njust in time. This is the way the fellaheen faced a breach. And this is\r\nhow the old Governors of Egypt faced them. During the flood of 1887 I\r\ncomplimented an official on the Nile bank, whose activity was quite\r\ndisproportionate to his apparent age. He told me that he was a\r\ncomparatively young man, but he had had charge of the Nile bank at Mit\r\nBadr when the great breach occurred in 1878, and that Ismail Pasha had\r\ntelegraphed orders to throw him and the engineer into the breach. He was\r\ngiven 12 hours’ grace by the local chief, and during that interval his\r\nhair had become white; subsequently he was pardoned. These were the\r\nsenseless orders which used to petrify officials into stupidity.\r\n\r\nThe following estimate was made by me of the cost of protecting the\r\nDelta proper between the two branches of the Nile during the high flood\r\nof 1887:--\r\n\r\nCost of protection for 432 kilometres of bank or 1,200,000 acres of\r\ncultivation:--\r\n\r\n                  {Sand bags    60,000 @ £ ·03             = £  1,800\r\n  _Materials_     {Stone         5,000 @ „ ·50             = „  2,500\r\n  _paid for_      {Stakes       55,000 @ „ ·06             = „  3,300\r\n                                                             --------\r\n                                                             £  7,600\r\n                                                             ========\r\n\r\n                  {Camel loads of stalk for 42 kilometres,\r\n  _Materials_     {  14,000  @ £ ·15                       = £  2,100\r\n  _not paid for_  {                                          --------\r\n                                      Total materials        £  9,700\r\n                                                             ========\r\n\r\n                   15 engineers @ £80                      = £  1,200\r\n                   Unpaid corvee, 1,374,079 men @ £ ·03    = „ 41,222\r\n                                                             ========\r\n                                            Total labour     £ 42,422\r\n                                                             ========\r\n                              Total materials and labour     £ 52,122\r\n\r\nThis works out to £120 per kilometre of bank, or £·045 per acre of land\r\nprotected. It is a very cheap insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nProjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n31. =Projects.=--No account of the Nile in 1904 would be complete\r\nwithout an enumeration and slight examination of the projects before the\r\npublic for the provision of sufficient water to the Nile in times of low\r\nsupply to insure the perennial irrigation of the whole of Egypt; to\r\nutilise these perennial waters by converting basin tracts into\r\nperennially irrigated ones; to protect the country from the dangers\r\naccompanying high floods; and to permit of the reclamation of the low\r\nsalted lands of Lower Egypt which border the Mediterranean sea.\r\n\r\nEgypt has a total irrigable area of 6¹⁄₄ millions acres. Of this area,\r\n¹⁄₄ of a million acres, which are to-day inundated in flood and lie\r\nalong the edge of the deserts, must continue to be inundated in flood\r\nfor all time, to prevent the sands of the desert from spreading over the\r\nNile Valley. Their value is £5,000,000. Four million acres are\r\nperennially irrigated. They have a mean value of £55 per acre, and have\r\na total value of £220,000,000. Of the remaining two million acres,\r\ntwo-thirds are irrigated only in flood and one-third is not irrigated at\r\nall. These 2 million acres have a mean value of £25 per acre, and are\r\nworth £50,000,000. The land of Egypt may be considered as worth\r\n£275,000,000 to-day. If it were possible to perennially irrigate the 2\r\nmillion acres which are without such irrigation, their value would be\r\nincreased by £30 per acre, or by £60,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe problem before us is how to provide perennial irrigation to these 2\r\nmillion acres and so add £60,000,000 to the wealth of the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that each milliard of cubic metres of water\r\nstored in reservoirs situated in Egypt itself is sufficient to insure\r\nthe conversion of half a million acres from flood to perennial\r\nirrigation. Egypt therefore requires reservoirs capable of storing 4\r\nmilliards of cubic metres of water.\r\n\r\nIn Mehemet Ali’s time, the great preoccupation of the Government was the\r\npressing on of the cultivation of cotton, and as this crop needed\r\nperennial irrigation, the securing of an abundant supply of water all\r\nthe year round was the problem of the day.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the ancient Lake Mœris had made a profound impression on the\r\nmind of Mehemet Ali, and he urged on his chief engineer the necessity of\r\nundertaking similar works. Linant Pasha first set himself to discover\r\nthe site of the ancient lake, and then estimated roughly the cost of\r\nreconstructing it, but considered the cost prohibitive. He recommended\r\nSilsila as a suitable site for a weir and a canal head. The failure of\r\nthe Barrage discouraged the Government from undertaking new works and\r\nthe question dropped. In 1880 Count de la Motte proposed a dam at\r\nSilsila and a reservoir to the south of it. He also proposed putting a\r\ncapacious depression to the east of Kalabsha in communication with the\r\nNile by the aid of a dam at Kalabsha.\r\n\r\nAbout two years later Mr. Cope Whitehouse suggested utilising the Wadi\r\nRayan depression as a reservoir. This depression had been already\r\nmentioned by Linant Pasha in his book and located by him on his\r\nhydrological map. Financial difficulties prevented Sir Colin\r\nScott-Moncrieff from immediately considering the question of reservoirs.\r\nThe success of the Barrage repairs in 1887 however gave new life to the\r\nquestion of reservoirs and Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff deputed Col.\r\nWestern to give scope to the suggestion made by Mr. Cope Whitehouse, to\r\nmake plans of the Wady Rayan and the deserts between it and the Nile, to\r\nfind out the capacity of the reservoir, and see if it could be utilised.\r\nCol. Western’s report, plans and estimates were printed by the Egyptian\r\nGovernment in 1888. At the same time I was deputed to examine the other\r\nprojects of Count de la Motte. In 1889 and 1891 I reported unfavourably\r\non them, because I could find no depression near Kalabsha to put in\r\ncommunication with the Nile, and could find no rock at Silsila on which\r\nto build a dam. The Bergat Takham pan was the only depression near\r\nKalabsha which could have been used as a reservoir and it was over 100\r\nmetres above the level of the Nile flood; while both in the Silsila pass\r\nand the Silsila gate I bored for rock and was everywhere still in sand\r\n10 metres below the level at which the existence of rock was assumed by\r\nthe Count’s engineers. On my report reaching Cairo, M. Prompt proposed\r\nusing the trough of the Nile itself at Kalabsha as a reservoir in place\r\nof the depression which did not exist. Col. Western left the country in\r\n1890 and I became Director General of Reservoir Studies. M. Prompt had\r\nsupposed that rock could be met with at Kalabsha at a depth of 4 metres\r\nbelow low-water level. I could not find it at a depth of 26 metres.\r\nAfter sounding and boring at every possible site on the Nile and\r\nsurveying, boring, and levelling in the desert between Wadi Halfa and\r\nthe Fayoum, I submitted my report in 1894, proposing an open dam at\r\nAssouan of a type which I trusted would meet the requirements of a Nile\r\nreservoir dam. Sir William Garstin approved of the site and the design,\r\nand the dam was built between 1898 and 1902 with Mr. Maurice Fitzmaurice\r\nC.M.G, as resident engineer.\r\n\r\nThe Assouan Reservoir at its present level contains one milliard of\r\ncubic metres of water which will suffice for the conversion of half a\r\nmillion acres to perennial irrigation, adding £15,000,000 to the wealth\r\nof the country. But though the dam was only completed at the end of\r\n1902, already the whole of the water has been devoted to special tracts,\r\nand the Government is reluctantly compelled to refuse all applications\r\nfor water.\r\n\r\n\r\n32. =The raising of the Assuân dam.=--Egypt already possesses the germ\r\nof all the storage works she needs. Six years ago a few far-seeing men\r\nsaw clearly what all of us understand to-day; but among the few, no man\r\nhad greater faith in the future of the country than Sir Ernest Cassel.\r\nThe Assouân Reservoir project had been lying buried for four years in\r\nofficial pigeon holes, when in 1898 Sir Ernest came forward with the\r\nfunds, and with Sir John Aird & Co., as contractors, and Sir Benjamin\r\nBaker as Consulting Engineer, undertook to complete the Assouân dam and\r\nthe Assiout weir by December 1903. The Egyptian Government, advised by\r\nSir William Garstin, accepted his offer, and received the completed\r\nworks by December 1902.\r\n\r\nThe Assouân dam is a granite structure 2,000 metres long which crosses\r\nthe head of the Assouân cataract of the Nile in one continuous straight\r\nline. The dam is pierced by 140 under sluices of 7 metres by 2 metres\r\nfor passing floods, and by 40 upper sluices of 3¹⁄₂ metres by 2 metres\r\nfor passing the high level water of the reservoir. The sluices are\r\nregulated by “Stoney” gates worked by winches at the roadway level.\r\n\r\nWhile the red, muddy waters of the Nile flood are pouring down the\r\nriver, the whole of the sluices are open and the river discharges itself\r\nthrough them without parting with its silt. This is the real object of\r\nthe sluices, for if the dam were solid and the river forced to flow over\r\nthe top, the reservoir would soon be filled with deposit and\r\nobliterated, while Egypt, deprived of this rich mud, would be\r\nconsiderably the poorer. This is the great feature of the dam. While the\r\ndam holds together, the reservoir will be free of silt.\r\n\r\nWhen the turbid flood has passed and the comparatively clear winter\r\nsupply of the river has begun to arrive, the sluices are gradually\r\nclosed and the reservoir filled. Beginning about the 1st December, the\r\nreservoir is filled in 100 days. It will ordinarily be full on the 1st\r\nMarch. No additional water is needed for irrigation between March 1st\r\nand May 1st as the river naturally has enough for the requirements of\r\nthe area at present under crop at this season. As the area under\r\nperennial irrigation will be gradually increased, the demand for water\r\nfor the new lands will begin about the 1st of April. The demand\r\nincreases through May and June, and the reservoir will then be aiding\r\nthe river with its supplement. If the flood is very late, water may be\r\nrequired from the reservoir till the 10th July; if the flood is early no\r\nwater will be needed after the 20th of June, as in 1903, the first year\r\nof the reservoir. The earlier the flood the more effective the\r\nreservoir. By the time the flood has begun to get turbid, the under and\r\nupper sluices will all be open and the muddy waters of the Nile will\r\nsweep through the dam without impediment.\r\n\r\nThe dam has worked for two years and given satisfaction. When the Nile\r\nwas at its lowest in May 1903, the natural discharge of the river,\r\nsupplemented by all the subsoil infiltration water which enters the\r\nriver between Assouân and the sea, was 400 cubic metres per second. The\r\nreservoir was adding 200 cubic metres per second to the supply, raising\r\nthe total supply available for irrigation to 600 cubic metres per\r\nsecond. The reservoir was supplying one-third of the water which was\r\nbeing utilized in Egypt. This water will suffice for an increase to the\r\nperennially irrigated area of ¹⁄₂ million acres.\r\n\r\nAt the time of designing the dam it was intended that it should be of\r\nsuch a section that it could be raised 6 metres in height and hold up\r\nanother milliard of cubic metres of water. Such an operation, if\r\nperformed to-day, would mean: the whole length of dam being raised 6\r\nmetres, the winches working the sluice gates being raised 6 metres and\r\nprovided with new wire ropes; and new copings being given to the\r\nparapets. It would necessitate two more locks and three more lock gates,\r\nand nothing else. The expenditure incurred would be about £500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n33. =The Wady Rayan Reservoir Project.=--When the Assouân dam will have\r\nbeen raised, we shall be standing on the threshold of what it will be\r\nable to do. The projected Wady Rayan reservoir, or the modern Lake\r\nMœris, will be well able to supply the two remaining milliards of cubic\r\nmetres of water when working in conjunction with the Assuân Reservoir.\r\nThe great weakness of this projected lake has lain in the fact that _by\r\nitself_ it could give a plentiful discharge in April and May, less in\r\nJune, and very little in July, and it was for this reason that in my\r\nreport of 1894 to the Egyptian Government I had reluctantly to recommend\r\nthat it be not carried out. But when the Assouân reservoir is capable of\r\nsupplying two milliards of cubic metres of water it will be possible to\r\nutilise the Mœris Lake to its utmost capacity. The Assouan Reservoir,\r\nbeing high above the level of the Nile can give its supply at the\r\nbeginning or end of the summer; it can give it slowly or with a rush;\r\nwhile the projected Lake Mœris, being directly in communication with the\r\nNile, and only slightly above low Nile level, its discharge would depend\r\nentirely on the difference of level between it and the Nile, and\r\nconsequently as the summer advanced its level would gradually fall and\r\nthe lake would not be able to give at the end of the summer a quarter of\r\nthe discharge it could give at the beginning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV\r\n\r\nPROPOSED WADI RAYAN RESERVOIR\r\n\r\nSHOWING THE FAYOUM\r\n\r\n  _All R. L.^{s} in metres, above or below mean sea._\r\n                              +        -\r\n\r\n_Desert._\r\n\r\n_Scale 1 : 500,000_\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.]\r\n\r\nBut let us imagine that the reservoir and the lake are both completed\r\nand full of water, and that it is the first of April. Lake Mœris will be\r\nopened on to the Nile and give all the water needed in that month, while\r\nthe Assouan Reservoir will be maintained at its full level. In May, Lake\r\nMœris will give nearly the whole supply and the reservoir will give a\r\nlittle. In June the lake will give little and the reservoir much; while\r\nin July the lake will give practically nothing and the reservoir the\r\nwhole supply. Working together in this harmonious manner, the reservoir\r\nand the lake, which are the true complements of each other, will easily\r\nprovide the whole of the water needed for Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe Wady Rayan is a depression in the deserts to the south of the Fayoum\r\nand separated from the Fayoum by a limestone ridge. In 1888 Col. Western\r\nrecommended it very strongly as a reservoir. In this he was supported by\r\nCol. Ross, the first Inspector General of irrigation. On Col. Western’s\r\nleaving Egypt, the study was entrusted to me, and Messrs. Hewat and\r\nClifton deputed to make a final project. The Wady Rayan project, with\r\nits plans and estimates, was published by the Egyptian Government in\r\n1894. As I said before, I was reluctantly compelled to reject its\r\nadoption owing to the one radical defect already described. That defect\r\nwill have been completely removed by the completion of the Assouân\r\nReservoir, when it will be possible to undertake the construction of the\r\nmodern lake Mœris.\r\n\r\nThe question of Lake Mœris has interested the world for centuries. For\r\nthe ancients it was one of the world’s seven wonders. Sir Hanbury Brown,\r\nin his book on the “Fayoum and Lake Mœris,” has collected all the\r\ninformation available about the lake, and after a thorough examination\r\nof the question has declared in favour of the Wady Rayan being converted\r\ninto a modern Lake Mœris.\r\n\r\nHerodotus, writing about B.C. 450, was the first to describe the lake:\r\n“Now the Labyrinth being such as I have described, the lake named that\r\nof Mœris, causes still greater astonishment, on the bank of which the\r\nLabyrinth was built.\r\n\r\n“The water in the lake is not derived from local sources, for the earth\r\nin that part is excessively dry and waterless, but it is brought in from\r\nthe Nile by a canal. It takes six months filling and six months flowing\r\nback. During the six months of the return flow, it yields a talent of\r\nsilver every day to the treasury, and during the flow twenty minæ for\r\nthe fish.”\r\n\r\nStrabo, writing in B. C. 20, remarks: “It has also a remarkable lake\r\ncalled the Lake of Mœris, large enough to be called a sea, and\r\nresembling the open sea in colour.\r\n\r\n“Thus the Lake of Mœris is, from its size and depth, capable of\r\nreceiving the overflow of the Nile at its rising, and preventing the\r\nflooding of houses and gardens; when the river falls, the lake again\r\ndischarges the water by a canal at both mouths, and it is available for\r\nirrigation. There are regulators at both ends for controlling the inflow\r\nand outflow.”\r\n\r\nDiodorus Siculus, writing at the same time, says:--“King Mœris dug a\r\nlake which is amazingly useful and incredibly large. For as the rising\r\nof the Nile is irregular, and the fertility of the country depends on\r\nits uniformity, he dug the lake for the reception of the superfluous\r\nwater, and he constructed a canal from the river to the lake 80 furlongs\r\nin length and 300 feet in breadth. Through this he admitted or let out\r\nthe water as required.”\r\n\r\nAt one time there was much discussion as to what was Lake Mœris, but\r\nsince the publication of Sir Hanbury’s book there can be but one\r\nopinion. The lake covered the whole of the modern Fayoum below the level\r\nof the contour which is 22¹⁄₂ metres above mean sea level. The common\r\nNile shells are to be met in myriads at any point on this contour round\r\nthe Fayoum that one cares to look for them. The ordinary high flood\r\nlevel of Kushesha basin to-day is 26¹⁄₂ metres above mean sea. In\r\nAmenemhat’s time, which was 4,000 years ago, the level was 4 metres\r\nlower, or at 22¹⁄₂ metres above mean sea. This was the highest possible\r\nlevel the lake could have attained in his day. In the course of time the\r\nlevel of the Nile valley rose by about 10 centimetres per century, but\r\nthe frequent occasions on which the canal was kept closed during poor\r\nand low floods gradually silted up the channel and made it less\r\ncapacious. As there are no Nile shells above the contour of 22¹⁄₂ metres\r\nabove mean sea (except a few on the south side of the lake which have\r\nevidently been blown up by the north west winds in sand drifts) it is\r\nevident that the gradual silting up of the channel more than kept pace\r\nwith the rising level of the Nile. Eventually the silting up exceeded\r\nthe rise, and that at an accelerated rate, the canal became weaker and\r\nweaker, and the Fayoum Province gradually occupied the site of the lake.\r\nLake Mœris had lasted over 2,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the Nile and the germ of the future Lake Mœris\r\nwas in existence in King Menes’s time, as I have been informed by\r\nprofessor Sayce, but it was King Amenemhat, of the XIIth dynasty, who\r\nwidened and deepened the canal, cleared away the rocky barriers, and\r\nconverted the trifling lake of King Menes’s time into the mighty inland\r\nsea which controlled the highest floods of the Nile. Those ancient\r\nPharaohs were giants in hydraulic engineering. They were, moreover, as\r\nwise as they were courageous.\r\n\r\nSir Hanbury Brown has well described the action of the lake. It had a\r\nsurface of 2,500 square kilometres, and being drained back into the Nile\r\nand kept at a low level it was able to take from a very high flood 20\r\nmilliards of cubic metres of water. It was quite capable of reducing a\r\nvery high flood to moderate dimensions; and if injudiciously or\r\nmaliciously opened in a low flood, it was capable of depriving Lower\r\nEgypt of any flood irrigation at all; and in those days they had\r\npractically no irrigation except flood irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe Wady Rayan, as already stated, is a depression in the Lybian hills\r\nimmediately south of the Fayoum. It has, at a level of about 29 metres\r\nabove the sea, a surface of 700 square kilometres, or about one quarter\r\nthe area of the ancient lake. Like the ancient lake, the lowest point of\r\nthe Wady is 41 metres below sea level. When filled with water the\r\ngreatest depth will be 70 metres. The uppermost four or five metres only\r\nwill be utilised annually, or some 3 milliards of cubic metres of water\r\nout of a total volume of 20 milliards. Just as the great size of the\r\nancient lake was of inestimable value to a work whose principal use lay\r\nin moderating high floods, so the smaller area of the modern lake will\r\nrender it far more useful as a work for feeding the low Nile. This lake,\r\nwill render no mean aid in time of dangerous floods, but, in its early\r\nyears, its main use will be the provision of water in summer. It will\r\nsupply the two milliards which are needed to convert the whole of Egypt\r\nfrom basin to perennial irrigation.\r\n\r\nIn my book on “The Assuân Reservoir and Lake Mœris” I have worked out\r\nthe cost of the project and estimated it at £2,600,000.\r\n\r\nThe rates I have allowed for the excavation work are considered too low\r\nby some critics. If the earthwork in the Nile Valley had to be excavated\r\nwithin 30-day rotations as on the running canals, I should be the first\r\nto agree; but the work will last three years and the contractors will be\r\nable to concentrate all the spare labour of the country on the works\r\nwhen demand for labour is slack, and in this way the rate of P.T. 3 per\r\ncubic metre which I have allowed will be found to be ample. In the hill\r\nof salted marl it will be possible to employ the American system of\r\nexcavating by the aid of water issuing from nozzles under pressure. By\r\nthis method it will be possible to do much work at P.T. 2 and P.T. 3 per\r\ncubic metre as it is done in America. I have allowed P.T. 5 per cubic\r\nmetre. To this hydraulic pressure work the salted marls will be\r\nspecially suited, and indeed the recollection of the ease with which\r\nAmenemhat dug his canal though this very material lasted long in the\r\nmemory of Egyptians. Some 1,600 years after the canal was excavated,\r\nHerodotus was informed that the excavated material was thrown into the\r\ncanal and transported by the running water. A 12-inch pump on the Yusufi\r\ncanal lifting water on to the top of the hill, a number of spade men\r\nhelping the water as it coursed down the hill and leading the liquid mud\r\nalong wooden troughs into side ravines and depressions, and a steep\r\nslope on the western half of the hill where the rock had been blasted\r\naway would soon remove all the material required at a very low cost. I\r\nhave allowed P.T. 10 per cubic metre for the soft limestone. Here it\r\nwill be easy to work on a vertical face of some 7 metres, blast out the\r\nrock, carry it away on four lines of railway running down hill, deposit\r\nthe rubble on the desert; and as each 7 metres depth is completed, to\r\nbegin the next 7 metres in depth in the same way.\r\n\r\nIn my 1894 Report I had anticipated difficulties with the canal running\r\nthrough the salted marl. Since then I have thoroughly inspected the\r\nravines in the Fayoum and seen the El-Bats ravine where it cuts through\r\nmany kilometres of this very salted marl. The sides are absolutely\r\nvertical and deposits of mud and self-sown tamarisk bushes protect the\r\nvertical sides at places where the running water is nearly touching the\r\nmarl. Such natural protection will be far superior to the masonry lining\r\nI proposed and far more effective. It will moreover cost nothing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PL. XVI.\r\n\r\nWADI RAYAN RESERVOIR\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION OF PROPOSED CANAL\r\n\r\n_Horizontal Scale 1 : 150.000_\r\n\r\n_Vertical Scale 1 : 600_\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION OF THE FAYOUM]\r\n\r\nTo those critics who suggest that the waters of the lake might become\r\nsalted or leak into the Fayoum I have to reply as follows: When the old\r\nLake Mœris, or the present Fayoum, was full of water and 63 metres\r\nhigher than the bottom of the Wady Rayan, and remained so for thousands\r\nof years, there was no question of the waters having become salted or\r\nhaving escaped into the Wady. The Wady was as dry as it is to-day and\r\nthe great inland sea was always fresh. If there had been any serious\r\ninfiltration from the ancient Lake Mœris into the Wady Rayan, there\r\nwould have resulted a lake which could not have escaped the notice of\r\nthe numerous travellers who visited the lake. No mention was ever made\r\nof such a lake. This body of water moreover would have been inhabited by\r\nfresh-water animals whose remains would have strewn its shores. No such\r\nremains are to be seen to-day. If therefore the ancient Lake Mœris with\r\na head of 63 metres on to the Wady Rayan could not leak into the Wady,\r\nit is not likely that the Wady Rayan reservoir with a head of from 27 to\r\n29 metres on the Garak side of the Fayoum will leak into that part of\r\nthe area covered by the ancient lake. Any leakage into the Lake Kurun\r\nside is never contemplated by anybody, since many kilometres of compact\r\nlimestone lie between the Wady Rayan and it, while about one or two\r\nkilometres of the same limestone lie between the Wady Rayan and the\r\nGarak depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n34. =Lake Albert reservoir project and project for training the Albert\r\nNile and the Zeraf River.=--If we wish not only to irrigate the whole of\r\nEgypt, but to include the Sudan in the sphere of operations we must\r\nregulate the supply issuing from Lake Albert Nyanza and ensure its\r\npassage through the great swamp regions. To my mind no work in the Sudd\r\nregions will be of any substantial value unless the Albert reservoir dam\r\nis first built. Tabulating the information collected in the gauges and\r\ndischarge tables we may state that the discharge of the Albert Nile in\r\ncubic metres per second between the 15th January and 15th May was as\r\nfollows in:--\r\n\r\n                                =1901=  =1902=  =1903=  =1904=\r\n  Discharge at Gondokoro          600     600     700    1000\r\n  Discharge above Sobat mouth     300     300     350     435\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the discharge at Gondokoro was as low as 500 cubic metres per\r\nsecond. It will be seen that, in spite of the great waste, there is an\r\nincrease at the northern end of the Sudd region even under present\r\nconditions when the discharge at the south end is increased in the\r\ninterval between the 15th January and 15th May. The water which enters\r\nthe White Nile during these months represents the summer contingent of\r\nthe White Nile to the Nile in Egypt.\r\n\r\nNow though an increase in April at the south end of the Sudd region is\r\nfelt at the north end, no such increase is felt in September and\r\nOctober, and the reason has been given in Chapters II and III.\r\n\r\nIn April the Sobat river is discharging practically nothing, and the\r\nwhole supply available in the Albert Nile can pass down the White Nile\r\npast the Sobat mouth. In September the Sobat river may be discharging\r\n750 to 1,000 cubic metres per second, and as the White Nile cannot\r\ndischarge the combined waters of the two rivers, the water of the Albert\r\nNile is headed up and accumulated in the lowlands between Lake No and\r\nthe Sobat mouth. This is greatly to the advantage of Egypt, for it is\r\nthe discharge at the head of the White Nile between January 15 and May\r\n15 which decides the White Nile contingent to the summer supply of the\r\nNile in Egypt, and the greater the quantity of water above the head of\r\nthe White Nile, in the absence of a regulator or barrage at Wadelai or\r\nDufilé, the better the summer supply of Egypt. After the abnormally high\r\nflood of 1878, when Gordon was up the Nile, so great was the\r\naccumulation that the discharge at Assuân never fell below 1500 cubic\r\nmetres per second in the summer of 1879. The Barrage was not regulated\r\nupon and yet all the Lower Egypt canals were full of water, and the\r\ncotton crop of Egypt for that year was quite abnormal for the seventies\r\nof the last century.\r\n\r\nNow an expenditure of between £400,000 and £1,000,000, say £800,000,\r\ncould secure a regulator for Lake Albert at any point between the outlet\r\nand Dufilé. Such a regulator would insure 1200 cubic metres per second\r\nevery year to the Albert Nile at Gondokoro between the 15th January and\r\nthe 15th May. With this supply insured, the training works in the Sudd\r\nregion would soon begin to affect the discharge at the north end of this\r\nregion where the White Nile begins.\r\n\r\nThe way in which this work of training should be carried out has been\r\nadmirably laid down in page 174 of Sir William Garstin’s Report. “Alter\r\nthe flood conditions of the Albert Nile (Bahr-el-Gebel) as little as\r\npossible, let the excess flood water escape on both sides, but keep the\r\nsummer supply in its channel.” This is, to my view, the soundest\r\nstatement from an engineering point of view in the whole report.\r\nHitherto we have always assumed a vast expenditure for keeping the flood\r\nsupply in one channel; but with our attention devoted to the summer\r\nchannel, we should have before us all the advantages of summer training\r\nworks without any fear of inundations. The very wildness of the regions\r\nwould be in our favour. To be able to train a river in summer without\r\nany nervousness about floods, is given to few engineers. I had never\r\nthought that any good thing could come out of the sudd region, but\r\nlooked at from this point of view, we can, even in this inhospitable\r\nwaste of waters, confirm Shakespeare’s saying that “there is some soul\r\nof goodness in things evil.”\r\n\r\nThe Lake Albert reservoir could easily insure 1200 cubic metres per\r\nsecond every year between the 15th January and the 15th May. To pass\r\nthrough the Sudd regions as much as possible of the 1200 cubic metres\r\nper second received at Gondokoro, the following works would be\r\nnecessary:--\r\n\r\nThe first work to be done would be the removal of sudd block No. 15\r\nwhich for 37 kilometres south of Hillet-el-Nuer has turned the Albert\r\nNile out of its course. The importance of this is strongly insisted on\r\nby Sir William Garstin on page 55 of Appendix VI of his Report, which is\r\nthe very last thing he wrote. With this block removed, the Albert Nile\r\nwould be given a good opportunity of working out its own salvation.\r\n\r\nThe next point is one to which I attach the greatest importance. Indeed,\r\nI look upon it as the key of the whole region. The Albert Nile enters\r\nthe south-east corner of Lake No and almost immediately afterwards\r\nleaves its east corner. Now Lake No is the final evaporating basin of\r\nthe Bahr-el-Gazelle, probably the most unsatisfactory river in the whole\r\nworld; and it is open to doubt whether in a year of deficient rainfall\r\non its own catchment basin and a year of good supply down the Albert\r\nNile, it does not evaporate a considerable quantity of the water of the\r\nAlbert Nile. If the discharge of the Albert Nile north of Hillet Nuer\r\nwas brought to 450 cubic metres per second in April, this lake might\r\nwaste much of it. Such being the case, a cut of a maximum length of some\r\n5 kilometres should be dredged south of the south-east corner of the\r\nlake, and the waters of the Albert Nile separated from those of the\r\nGazelle. A cheap wooden lock and regulator would allow boats to pass,\r\nand take in any water from the Gazelle river when it had it to give.\r\nThe maximum water we have to deal with is zero in summer and 40 cubic\r\nmetres per second in flood. If the Albert Nile were separated from the\r\nGazelle, it might be found that the waters of the Gazelle river found\r\ntheir way into the Albert Nile through that mysterious and\r\nunsatisfactory river the Lolle. Some use might even be found for it. I\r\nhave, since I wrote this, been informed by Capt. Lyons that Marno in\r\n1881 proposed this cut round the south-east corner of Lake No. (Pet.\r\nMitheil, 1881, page 425 and plate 20).\r\n\r\nThe Albert Nile to-day at Hillet-el-Nuer is capable of carrying 450\r\ncubic metres per second. North of Hillet-el-Nuer, the Albert Nile has a\r\nmean width of 75 metres, but owing to want of training and papyrus\r\nswamps, the discharge dwindles down to 320 cubic metres per second. The\r\nAlbert Nile has in this reach a very good section indeed and by\r\nbeginning with the west bank and dredging round corners and closing\r\nspills by dredged earth, an improvement of section and slope, backed up\r\nby a permanent discharge of 450 cubic metres per second at\r\nHillet-el-Nuer, might speedily result in this very discharge of 450\r\ncubic metres per second being obtained south of Lake No. We are here in\r\nsuch swamped land that percolation would be practically zero. There are\r\nonly 200 kilometres of channel with all its curves, or 160 kilometres of\r\ntrained channel to work at, in which 75 per cent of the work is to hand;\r\nand we have to confine our attention to the low supply without worrying\r\nover the flood supplies.\r\n\r\nNow the Bahr-el-Zeraf could be made capable of carrying 150 cubic metres\r\nper second by an improvement of the inlet at Baker’s channel and by\r\ndredging north of Ghaba Shambe, as will be seen by examining the\r\nmeasured discharges of the Bahr. With the Bahr-el-Zeraf carrying 150\r\ncubic metres per second and the Albert Nile carrying 450 cubic metres\r\nper second, we should have ensured 600 cubic metres per second. As time\r\nwent on, improvements in the channels would make themselves felt, as\r\nthey are even doing to-day, and we might even have 700 and 800 cubic\r\nmetres per second at the head of the White Nile below the Sobat mouth.\r\nWe must always remember that it is assumed that the lake Albert\r\nreservoir dam has been constructed and a supply of 1,200 cubic metres\r\nper second assured at Gondokoro from January to May. If the Sobat river\r\nwere capable of regulation downstream of the Pibor marshes, we might get\r\nan increase from that direction as well. The possibility of a good site\r\nfor a reservoir upstream of Nasser is very great. The Nasser gauge rises\r\nand falls so slowly that there must be very great natural accumulations\r\nof water upstream of it, which might be improved. The question of\r\nquality needs study.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of 435 cubic metres per second, which the rivers in their\r\npresent state, aided by the Lake Albert reservoir, could deliver into\r\nthe White Nile, would thus see itself gradually increased to 500, 550,\r\nand 600 cubic metres per second and even more, and would enter the White\r\nNile past the Sobat mouth in February, March, April and May. During\r\nthese months the whole of the supply would pass down the White Nile\r\nwithout throwing backwater on the rivers. Later on, when the Sobat river\r\ncame down in flood and filled up the channel of the White Nile, the\r\nAlbert Nile would have its waters reduced at the Albert regulator, and\r\nthe waters of Lake Albert would again be stored for the day when the\r\nSobat floods had fallen and the White Nile channel was free and ready to\r\ntake in the waters of the Albert Nile.\r\n\r\nWhile I had contemplated the training of the flood waters of the Albert\r\nNile through the Sudd regions I had estimated the cost at £100,000 per\r\nannum, for 25 years, or at £2,500,000. Now, however, that Sir William\r\nGarstin has shown how we need only attend to the summer supplies, the\r\nsum may be reduced to half the former figure or to £1,200,000, and be\r\nmore than ample. With £2,000,000 devoted to the Lake Albert reservoir\r\nand the training works in the Sudd region, the summer supply of Egypt\r\nand the northern Sudan would be put on a firm base.\r\n\r\nDr. Schweinfurth, the eminent African traveller and savant, was the\r\nfirst to call the attention of the Egyptian Government to the necessity\r\nof closing the spills from the White Nile to the north of Gondokoro, and\r\nso beginning the training of the river. He very rightly said:--“Many\r\nyears would elapse before the desired result would be obtained by the\r\nstrengthening of the banks, but the works would be increasingly felt\r\nevery year in Egypt as the works progressed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n35. =Flood protection for Egypt.=--In paragraph 30 it was stated that\r\nthe floods in the Delta or in Lower Egypt can rise to a height of from 2\r\nto 3¹⁄₂ metres above the level of the country. Such floods are really\r\ndangerous and means should be found for moderating them.\r\n\r\nThe Wady Rayan reservoir, when converted into the modern Lake Mœris and\r\nacting as a reservoir, will have one great advantage, it will be able to\r\nlower a high flood 30 centimetres for 50 days. This will give relief to\r\nthe Nile, a relief which will be much appreciated by the whole country\r\nfrom Beni Suef to the sea, and especially by Cairo.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the Damietta branch is especially dangerous\r\nand unfit to act as an escape under existing conditions. That branch\r\ncould be regulated on at its head and treated like a canal. Thanks to\r\nSir Hanbury Brown’s initiative the Barrages can be regulated on in flood\r\nas well as in summer, and by lowering the supply in the Damietta branch\r\nand turning the surplus down the Rosetta branch, the latter would become\r\nthe flood escape of the Nile. It might be trained as Mr. Eads suggested\r\nthat rivers should be treated.\r\n\r\nMr. Eads’ argument is very clear. He insists that rivers eat away their\r\nbanks in places, not owing to the direct action of the water but by the\r\nalterations in the velocity of the current. When the river water is\r\ncharged with sediment to its full carrying capacity it cannot take up\r\nmore unless the rate of current be increased. If the channel be nearly\r\nuniform the river water cannot eat away any of its banks. If, however,\r\nthe channel is varying, the silt deposits in the wide sections, and the\r\nwater, free of some of its sediment, is ready to eat more. It is this\r\nalternate dropping silt and eating away of earth which does the harm. To\r\ntreat the Rosetta branch according to Mr. Eads it would be necessary to\r\nfix the top width to be worked to, at say 550 metres. The river could be\r\nbrought to this uniform top width by building light inexpensive\r\npermeable spurs on the sandy shoals. The land between the spurs would\r\nbecome cultivated and such river training would pay the Government,\r\nwhich taxes all cultivated land; it would even pay handsomely for any\r\ncompany to undertake the work once the rule about foreshores was\r\nunderstood. The Government would, however, always succeed; when it could\r\nnot sell, it could always tax. Such training would permanently lower the\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above it would be necessary to complete the system of\r\nspurs begun in 1884, and to throw back the banks as already recommended.\r\nIt has been estimated that the completion of this work would cost\r\n£900,000 for spurs and banks, while the training works would pay for\r\nthemselves in addition to greatly improving the channel and lowering the\r\nlevel of the flood.\r\n\r\nIt may be humiliating to make the confession, but from B.C. 2,200 to the\r\nArab invasion of Egypt in A.D. 640, while Lake Mœris performed its\r\nallotted task and the Nile possessed training works such as those we\r\ncan see to-day in Nubia, Egypt was better protected from inundation, and\r\nthe Nile better trained, than it is to-day. And yet we have many\r\nadvantages which no Pharaoh possessed. By the aid of telegraphy we have\r\nknowledge of a coming flood a full fifteen days before it arrives in the\r\nDelta; the Khartoum gauge allows us to anticipate its very height.\r\nMeteorology is aiding us still further. In a paper I read at the Chicago\r\nInternational Exhibition I stated that years of heavy rainfall in India\r\nare years of high flood in Egypt, while years of poor rainfall in India\r\nare years of low flood in Egypt. Sir John Eliot, the Director General of\r\nthe Meteorological Department of India, corrected this statement. He\r\nsaid that though this was not true of the Bengal monsoon, it was true of\r\nthe Bombay monsoon. Years of heavy rainfall in Gujerat and Bombay are\r\nyears of high flood on the Nile, and vice versà. As the rain falls in\r\nBombay a month earlier than the Nile flood reaches Cairo, we have\r\ninformation of a high flood a month before it arrives, if we receive\r\ntelegraphic information from Bombay.\r\n\r\n\r\n36. =Complete project for water storage and flood protection for\r\nEgypt.=--The complete project for water storage and flood protection for\r\nEgypt as proposed by me, contemplates the following works:--\r\n\r\n  Raising the Assuân reservoir (2 years)              £   500,000\r\n  Wady Rayan reservoir (4 years)                      „ 2,600,000\r\n  Training the Rosetta branch                         „   900,000\r\n                                                      -----------\r\n  Total                                               £ 4,000,000\r\n                                                      ===========\r\n\r\nTo these have to be added the approximate estimates of the proposed\r\nworks on the Upper Nile:--\r\n\r\n  Regulator for Lake Albert (4 years)                  £  800,000\r\n  Dredging and training works in the Albert Nile and\r\n    the Zeraf river (12 years)                        £ 1,200,000\r\n                                                      -----------\r\n  Total                                               £ 2,000,000\r\n                                                      ===========\r\n  Grand total of works on the Upper and Lower Nile    £ 6,000,000\r\n                                                      ===========\r\n\r\nThe total expenditure amounts to £6,000,000 spread over 12 years.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of undertaking all those works together may be thus\r\nsummarized. The increased supply from the Assuân reservoir will be felt\r\nin Egypt after a period of two years. Five years later the waters of the\r\nWady Rayan will be added to those of the Assuân reservoir, and it will\r\nbe possible to increase the cotton crop of Egypt from 6 million to 10\r\nmillion cwt. It will be possible to allow the Sudan to thoroughly\r\ndevelop its agricultural resources, and with the aid of the 25,000 horse\r\npower as a minimum which the 6th cataract near Khartoum can supply, to\r\nutilise for its own consumption the waters which can be stored at that\r\ncataract; and, in addition to those, the available supplies from Lake\r\nTsana provided that that lake is furnished with an outlet tunnel.\r\n\r\nWhile all this life and activity will be developing themselves in Egypt\r\nand the Sudan, the effects of the regulator of Lake Albert and the\r\ntraining of the Albert Nile in the Sudd regions will be gradually\r\nasserting themselves; and, if the works are being steadily and\r\nperseveringly carried out, it is well within the range of possibility\r\nthat before 10 or 12 years will have passed, the additional supplies\r\nfrom the upper waters of the White Nile will have become so ample, that\r\nit will be possible to dispense with the Wady Rayan as a reservoir. When\r\nthis will have happened, the Wady Rayan with its canal will become the\r\ntrue flood escape of Egypt, like the ancient Lake Mœris, and will, with\r\nthe Rosetta branch, afford complete protection to Egypt against the\r\ndangers of a high flood. Egypt, in the fullest meaning of the term, will\r\nbe enjoying perennial irrigation and flood protection.\r\n\r\nIn my book on the “Assuân Reservoir and Lake Mœris” I had recommended a\r\nmore extended programme, but the reading of Sir William Garstin’s Report\r\nhas convinced me that useful as the Lake Victoria reservoir dam may be,\r\nits postponement as recommended by Sir William is sound, until all the\r\nother works have been executed. The really essential work is the Lake\r\nAlbert reservoir dam, of which the study might indeed be commenced\r\nimmediately. Sir William’s proposal to train the summer supply of the\r\nAlbert Nile and allow the overflow of the floods to find its way through\r\nthe Sudd region is so sound and convincing that the necessary training\r\nworks in the Sudd region are greatly reduced. With these reductions the\r\nestimated cost of the project for water storage and flood protection for\r\nEgypt is reduced from £8,200,000 to £6,000,000. I have left the Wady\r\nRayan estimate as it was in my original programme. Mr. Webb’s criticism\r\nof the project was based on facts which are outside the project. He\r\nsupposed that the Wady Rayan was to remain a reservoir for all time and\r\nthat it was not to be aided by the works on the Upper Nile. Now the\r\nproject I proposed and which I propose now, presupposes that the Wady\r\nRayan will be a temporary reservoir and final flood escape for the Nile,\r\nand that it will be aided in years of very deficient flood by the\r\ngradual improvement of the Upper Nile owing to the works undertaken\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n37. =Sir William Garstin’s programme for water storage and flood\r\ncontrol.=--In the first appendix to his Report on the Upper Nile, Sir\r\nWilliam Garstin, G.C.M.G., Adviser to the Ministry of Public Works, has\r\ndrawn up a programme of works for water storage and flood control in the\r\nNile valley. He approves of the raising of the Assuân dam for £500,000,\r\nand the conversion of the Rosetta branch of the Nile into a flood escape\r\nfor £900,000. He then conditionally approves of a proposal suggested by\r\nMr. J. S. Beresford, C.I.E., for making a straight cut from Bor on the\r\nAlbert Nile to the mouth of the Sobat river at the tail of the Albert\r\nNile. The line would be 340 kilometres in length and is estimated to\r\ncost £5,500,000, and carry 600 cubic metres per second in summer. In\r\ncase of the line being found impracticable when it was surveyed and\r\nlevelled, Sir William proposed abandoning the Albert Nile and thoroughly\r\nwidening and deepening the Zeraf river for £3,400,000.\r\n\r\nAs a criticism of the Bor cut project I cannot write anything more\r\nconvincing from my point of view than a letter written by me and\r\npublished by “The Engineer” in October of this year.\r\n\r\n“In your issue of the 16th September Sir Hanbury Brown has reviewed the\r\nscheme suggested by Mr. J. S. Beresford, C.I.E., and conditionally\r\napproved by Sir William Garstin, for diverting the waters of the Albert\r\nNile (known as the Bahr-el-Gebel) from Bor to the mouth of the Sobat\r\nriver, on a length 340 kilometres, and sending them down a canal capable\r\nof carrying 600 cubic metres per second, at an estimated cost of\r\n£5,500,000. In his review Sir Hanbury puts his finger on the weak point\r\nin the project, viz., the difficulty and loss of water entailed at the\r\ncrossing of the Albert Nile just upstream of the Sobat mouth. The\r\ndifficulty will be got over, as Sir Hanbury himself suggests, by an\r\nearthen embankment provided with a regulator. The loss of water cannot\r\nbe got over.\r\n\r\n“I have taken the following figures from Sir William’s report and from\r\nthe gauge records of the Public Works Ministry:--\r\n\r\nDISCHARGE IN CUBIC METRES PER SECOND DURING FEBRUARY, MARCH, AND APRIL\r\nOF THE ALBERT NILE.\r\n\r\n                                           1901.  1902.  1903.  1904.\r\n\r\n  At Gondokoro above Bor                    600    600    700  1,000\r\n  Upstream of the mouth of the Sobat river  300    300    350    435\r\n\r\n“Now, in a year like 1901 or 1902, with 600 cubic metres per second\r\npassing Gondokoro, the diversion canal might be allowed to take in 500\r\ncubic metres per second, leaving 100 cubic metres per second for the\r\nAlbert Nile, Atem river, and all the Nuer, Dinka, and Shillook country\r\nbetween Gondokoro and the Sobat mouth. An allowance of 100 cubic metres\r\nper second would not be liberal, and would probably result in the water\r\nbecoming stagnant and very impure; but we shall leave that alone.\r\nStarting with 500 cubic metres per second of clear water the high level\r\ndiversion canal would never lose less than 50 cubic metres per second\r\nthrough percolation and evaporation before it reached the Sobat mouth.\r\nMany authorities would put the loss at 40 per cent., but we shall say 10\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n“We should then have 450 cubic metres per second entering the White Nile\r\nat its head, just at the end of the Albert Nile and at the mouth of the\r\nSobat river. At this point, however, under normal conditions the Albert\r\nNile would have been discharging 300 cubic metres per second. This\r\nsupply, after the opening of the diversion canal, would have failed\r\nutterly, as the waters of the Albert Nile would have been diverted down\r\nthe diversion canal. Whatever water there was in the Albert Nile would,\r\nmoreover, have been at so low a level that it could not have flowed down\r\nthe White Nile together with the high level water of the diversion\r\ncanal. We should therefore have had in a year like 1901 and 1902 a net\r\ngain of 450 less 300 cubic metres per second, or 150 cubic metres per\r\nsecond at the head of the White Nile. By the time this extra water\r\nreached Assuân it would have become 100 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\n“If this project, or any other project of any kind, is ever to be\r\ncarried out on the upper waters of the White Nile, the very first thing\r\nto be done will be to construct a weir or barrage at the outlet of the\r\nAlbert Lake, at Wadelai, or lower down at Dufile. I should say, judging\r\nfrom the map and the cross section, that Wadelai itself would be an\r\nexcellent site for a weir. I have advocated this project in season and\r\nout of season these ten years, and now that actual discharges and\r\nfigures are before me I am more than ever convinced that I was no untrue\r\nprophet when I wrote in my book on “The Assuân Reservoir Dam and After”\r\nthat “the point where Lake Albert ends and the Albert Nile begins to\r\nhave a rapid and contracted stream will be the site of the future great\r\nregulator or barrage of the upper waters of the Nile. This work will be\r\nhere or at Dufile.” Such a work would cost anything between £400,000 and\r\n£1,000,000.\r\n\r\n“If such a work were carried out it would be possible to insure every\r\nyear a discharge of between 1,000 and 1,500 cubic metres per second at\r\nGondokoro from the 15th of January to the 15th of May, _i.e._, during\r\nthe months which determine the summer water supply of the White Nile for\r\nEgypt. Such a quantity of water would insure 435 cubic metres per second\r\nat the head of the White Nile, as it has done this year, even under\r\nexisting conditions; while with training and dredger work in the Albert\r\nNile and Bahr Zeraf between Gondokoro and Lake No, it might be increased\r\nto 600 cubic metres per second, and even more. The way in which this\r\nwork of training should be carried out has been admirably laid down on\r\npage 174 of Sir William’s Report”.\r\n\r\nThere are moreover other reasons I think for condemning the excavation\r\nof a straight cut 340 kilometres in length across the eastern corner of\r\nthe Sudd regions. The reasons are to be found in Sir William Garstin’s\r\nReport itself. One of the most interesting features of this report is\r\nthe number of actually measured discharges at different sites. Of all\r\nthese sites Gondokoro, the southern key of the Sudd region, is the most\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident from an examination of Sections Nos. 18, 19, 26 and\r\n27, Plate VIII of Sir William’s Report, that the Albert Nile at\r\nGondokoro scours out its bed very severely after a high flood like that\r\nof 1903. The width of the section is about 230 metres with vertical\r\nsides, and yet while a gauge of ·50 metres on the 1st April 1903 (after\r\nthe low year of 1902) gave a section of 615 square metres; on the 9th\r\nSeptember 1903 (after a good year), the section was 1,347 square metres\r\nfor a gauge of 2.33 metres. In other words, a rise of 1.83 metres gave\r\nan increased section of 732 square metres; while, if the bed had not\r\nscoured, it would have been 421 square metres. We have here an increase\r\nof 311 square metres, or more than 1 metre of scour. All this happened\r\nin 5 months, and proves that the clear water of the lakes, when in\r\nvolume, has a fine cutting edge.\r\n\r\nIn footnote (2) of page 116 of his Report, Sir William Garstin says that\r\nin the parts of the river where the sudd has been cleared there are\r\nindications that a scour of the bed has set in. Again, on page 55 of the\r\nappendix, he says that the removal of the sudds has caused the levels of\r\nthe shallow lakes to fall. All this proves that if the spills and\r\nescapes from the Albert Nile were closed with ambatch, as proposed by\r\nSir William Garstin on page 175, and a few dredgers put into the Albert\r\nNile and the Zeraf river the expenditure of a sum of money very moderate\r\nindeed compared with £5,500,000 would in all probability result in the\r\ntwo rivers being so widened and deepened that they could carry the full\r\nsummer supply of the lakes, and so there would be a resulting economy of\r\nover £4,500,000 in the new channel from Bor which, when it began\r\nworking, might introduce on an aggravated scale all the difficulties of\r\nto-day in the Albert Nile.\r\n\r\nA good description of certain spills is given on page 112 of the Report,\r\na good idea of scour in Plate XXIX., opposite page 110, while on page\r\n181 Sir William Garstin makes the remark that the experience of American\r\nengineers has taught us that though in theory it may be possible to\r\nshorten or straighten a great river, in actual practice it is\r\naccompanied with almost insurmountable difficulties. If the new channel\r\nwere dug and set working, in a few years it might be as crooked as the\r\nAlbert Nile itself, unless it were protected with stone along its entire\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nIn my project for deepening and widening both the Albert Nile and the\r\nZeraf river to enable them to carry 600 cubic metres per second, I think\r\nI have given very solid reasons against abandoning the Albert Nile and\r\nsending the whole supply down the Zeraf river at a cost of £3,400,000.\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that Sir William Garstin’s recent objections to the\r\nAlbert Nile are founded on an oversight. He has, apparently, not kept\r\nthe flood discharges of the Albert Nile at Gondokoro and above the Sobat\r\nmouth sufficiently apart from those of low supply. It is the Sobat\r\nflood, combined with the poor carrying capacity of the White Nile, which\r\nis the disturbing factor, and not any inherent viciousness in the\r\nAlbert Nile itself. The Albert Nile has a good section, and, if it were\r\ntrained in conjunction with the Zeraf river, would, I feel confident,\r\ndischarge all the water required with a very moderate expenditure of\r\nmoney. This, I always understood, was Sir William’s own opinion. In such\r\nprojects it is wise to remember Horace’s saying, “Naturam furcâ expellas\r\ntamenusque recurrit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n38. =Project for converting the basin irrigated lands of Upper Egypt\r\ninto perennially irrigated lands.=--No consideration of this question\r\nwould be complete without first examining into the changes which would\r\nbe made in the regimen of the Nile flood by the contemplated conversion\r\nof basin irrigation into perennial irrigation. This question was\r\nexamined very thoroughly by me in 1892 and 1893 and I give here my\r\narguments for not anticipating any serious difficulties.\r\n\r\nWe have to consider the effect of the introduction of perennial\r\nirrigation on the regime of the Nile. The perfection of the perennial\r\nirrigation of the Delta north of Cairo will in no way affect the Nile in\r\nflood. The canals will continue to run as they do at present, and the\r\nquestion of conversion in Lower Egypt is therefore quite independent of\r\nthe subject of flood protection. In Upper Egypt, however, we have\r\n1,460,000 acres of basin irrigation; and as each acre receives in a low\r\nflood 80 cubic metres of water per day, in an ordinary flood 130 cubic\r\nmetres per day, and in an extraordinary flood 170 cubic metres per day,\r\nwhile the demands of perennial irrigation are only 25 cubic metres per\r\nacre per day, it will readily be understood that we are dealing with a\r\nquantity of water which demands the greatest attention.\r\n\r\nTo foretell with exactitude the anticipated changes in the regime of the\r\nNile, it is necessary to know first the daily gauges of the Nile at\r\nAssuân and Cairo for a period of at least twenty years, and the\r\ndischarges corresponding to these gauges. The difference between these\r\ndischarges represents the consumption of water. We have next to\r\ndetermine the amount of water which passes into the canals, the amount\r\nutilised in filling up the trough of the Nile and covering the berms,\r\nand the amounts evaporated and absorbed. We know that the last three\r\nitems are constant while the canal discharges are variable and depend on\r\nthe system of irrigation and, if our data are correct, we can tell with\r\nmoderate certainty what changes in the level of the Nile will follow\r\ncertain changes in the system of irrigation.\r\n\r\nTables 65 and 67 of Appendix L contain the Assuân and Cairo gauges for\r\ntypical years in a period of twenty years from 1873 to 1892, and the\r\nmean gauges of these twenty years. Finding it impossible to understand\r\nthe Nile without first referring every gauge to some uniform standard, I\r\nhave had to choose the line of reference. The mean high water level and\r\nthe mean low water level are both available. In Egypt the mean high\r\nwater level varies very considerably whether we take it in August and\r\nthe early part of September when the basin canals are running full\r\nsupply, or in the latter half of September when the canals are running\r\nonly half supply, or in October when the basins are discharging back\r\ninto the Nile. Early and quick rising floods have a different series of\r\nlevels from slow and late floods; while again the recent works carried\r\nout in Upper Egypt by Col. Ross have so increased the discharging\r\ncapacity of the canals that the flood gauges have been appreciably\r\naffected. All this points to the conclusion that the mean high flood is\r\nno satisfactory standard. The mean low flood on the other hand is much\r\nless liable to change and is very fairly constant from year to year.\r\nHigh floods are certainly followed by scouring out of the bed, and low\r\nfloods by a silting up of the channel, but the changes are very moderate\r\ncompared to those in high flood. I have chosen the mean low water level\r\nas the line of reference, and referred all gauges to it. From the mean\r\nof twenty years’ observations, this level at Assuân is R. L. 85 metres.\r\nBy observations along the Nile generally, and by calculations at Cairo,\r\nI have fixed it at all important places north of Assuân. Table 46 of\r\nAppendix K gives the Reduced Levels at different places, while it is\r\nalso drawn on the longitudinal section of the Nile in Plate XII. It was\r\non this system that the ancient Egyptian engineers worked the Nile. They\r\nhowever chose the mean high water level during the early part of the\r\nflood as their standard of reference and consequently made the so called\r\ncubits in the flood reaches of the Cairo gauge half cubits. This means a\r\ndischarge of 1600 cubic metres per second and fairly represents the\r\ndischarges of the basin canals in flood. When it is considered that the\r\nlevel of the Nile valley is raised by about 10 centimetres per 100 years\r\nit will be seen that the old Cairo gauge, which was a living record 1500\r\nyears ago, is to-day a meaningless anachronism. It has also to be\r\ncompared with the Assuân gauge which was erected in Ismail Pasha’s time\r\nwith an arbitrary zero some 90 centimetres below mean low water level,\r\nand which may be reading 17 cubits while Cairo may be recording 25\r\ncubits. The Cairo gauges in winter and summer are no records of\r\ndischarge as the afflux from the Barrage affects them. To find the\r\ndischarge at Cairo during these months, I have added those of the\r\nRosetta and Damietta branches and the Delta canals upstream of the\r\nBarrage. When the Nile falls below mean low water level, the gauges are\r\nrecorded as minus quantities.\r\n\r\nDischarge sites having been chosen for the Assuân, Assiout and Cairo\r\ngauges on the Nile, a continuous series of surface velocity\r\nobservations, cross sections and slope measurements were made during\r\n1892 and 1893 and the resulting discharges recorded. Curves of discharge\r\nhave been drawn and referred to the gauges of twenty years and modified\r\nuntil finally a curve has been found which will suit any year whether it\r\nis a maximum or a minimum. In connection with this subject, it must be\r\nremembered that the Nile bed is raised by silt during low floods and\r\nscoured out during high floods and that consequently August and\r\nSeptember discharges vary considerably at times from October and\r\nNovember discharges for the same gauge. In addition to this, it must\r\nalso be borne in mind that the slope of water surface and that\r\nconsequently the discharge of a flood during the rise is far greater\r\nthan during the fall for the same gauge reading. Indeed the Nile often\r\ndischarges more when it is 30 centimetres below its maximum and rising\r\nfast than when it has reached its maximum and begun to fall. It is owing\r\nto this fact that we often see the discrepancy of the Assuân gauge\r\nreaching its maximum a day before Halfa which is 350 kilometres higher\r\nup the river. The discharge depends on gauge and slope, and the gauge\r\nonly records one element. Keeping these facts in my mind, I saw that it\r\nwas of no use recording the gauges to two places of decimals and\r\ncovering paper with useless figures, and consequently I have chosen the\r\nhigher unit for a rising gauge and the lower for a falling gauge when I\r\nhave been dealing with discharges.\r\n\r\nFlood discharges have been taken of all the canals in Upper Egypt\r\nthrough 1892 and 1893 and have been recorded in Tables 48 and 49 of\r\nAppendix K. From these tables, Table 47 has been compiled which gives\r\nrough approximate discharges of the canals corresponding to the Assuân\r\ngauges in the first half of the flood.\r\n\r\nTo obtain information about the trough of the Nile, the area exposed to\r\nevaporation and the area of absorption, a longitudinal section of the\r\nNile from Assuân to Cairo has been levelled, and cross sections taken at\r\nevery 3 kilometres. The kilometrage on Plate XII counts from the Assuân\r\ngauge and is measured down the centre of discharge of the flood, since\r\nit is with flood discharges that we are principally dealing. As the Nile\r\nwinds about considerably and is often broken into numerous channels, the\r\nareas of the cross sections vary very appreciably according as they are\r\ntaken at right angles to the centre line of discharge or of the deep\r\nchannel of the river. The former gives the more reliable results. I have\r\ntaken 8 millimetres per day as the evaporation during flood in Upper\r\nEgypt. The absorption has been calculated from the water consumption\r\nduring the floods of 1892 and 1893, and found to be about 300 cubic\r\nmetres per second between Assuân and Assiout, where there is practically\r\nno perennial irrigation. Between Assiout and Cairo, where there is a\r\nconsiderable length of perennial irrigation on one bank and limestone\r\nrock on the other, the absorption is about 100 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\nWhen perennial irrigation has once established itself in Upper Egypt, we\r\nmay assume that the absorption during flood will be halved in quantity\r\nfor the reasons given above, and become 150 cubic metres per second\r\nbetween Assuân and Assiout, and 50 cubic metres per second between\r\nAssiout and Cairo. The amount of water expended in irrigation will be\r\nabout 700 cubic metres per second. The evaporation during flood will be\r\napproximately 120 cubic metres per second. The quantity of water needed\r\nto fill the trough of the Nile will depend on the gauges and may be\r\ncalculated from table 43 of Appendix K. The last item will be the only\r\nvariable one and the others may be approximately tabulated as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Expenditure of water in flood in cubic metres per second_:\r\n\r\n                         BETWEEN ASSUÂN  BETWEEN ASSIOUT    TOTAL\r\n                          AND ASSIOUT.

were discharged on a\r\nfalling Nile, still they raised the Cairo gauge to 8·7 metres on the 5th\r\nOctober while it would have risen to 8·5 on the 15th September with\r\nperennial irrigation. The flood of 1878 was an exceedingly late one and\r\nthe basins had to be discharged while the river was still very high. By\r\nthe 10th October, the river had risen to 8·7 metres at Cairo when the\r\nbanks were breached and all future rise stopped. With perennial\r\nirrigation, the maximum gauge of 8·6 metres would have been reached on\r\nthe 10th October. The flood of 1892 was at Assuân 10 centimetres below\r\nthat of 1874 and 20 centimetres below that of 1878, and midway between\r\nthem in point of time. It was also under complete control owing to the\r\nnew regulating works on the basins. It rose to 8·4 metres at Cairo on\r\nthe 5th October and fell exceedingly slowly. With perennial irrigation,\r\nit would have risen to 8·4 at Cairo on the 30th September and then\r\nfallen rapidly.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, we may say that with perennial irrigation the very\r\nhigh floods at Cairo will be 15 days in advance of what they are at\r\npresent, that they will not rise higher, and that they will fall 15 days\r\nearlier than what they do now. With low floods there will be no\r\nappreciable difference as to date, but the floods will be slightly\r\nhigher at Cairo. In ordinary floods, there will be an advance of from 20\r\nto 25 days in the date of the maximum flood, and a maximum gauge at\r\nCairo 50 or 60 centimetres under the maximum gauge at Assuân. We have so\r\nfar considered Cairo only, as the Delta proper depends on the Cairo\r\ngauge. We now turn to the Nile in Upper Egypt itself: south of Sohag,\r\nthere will be no serious change in levels, but the Sohagia and Ibrahimia\r\ncanals between them carry at present 750 cubic metres per second in\r\nexcess of what they would carry if there were perennial irrigation in\r\nEgypt, and the greater part of this water is not returned to the Nile\r\nuntil the Kushesha escape is reached. The reach of the Nile from Sohag\r\nto Kushesha is the one which will experience the greatest changes, and I\r\ncalculate that there will be a rise of 40 centimetres as compared with\r\nthe maximum gauges under basin irrigation.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that at the beginning of this paragraph I stated that\r\n“the perfection of the perennial irrigation of the Delta north of Cairo\r\nwill in no way affect the Nile in flood.” This had reference only to the\r\nquantity of water taken from the Nile in high floods. There is however\r\none very serious aspect of this question. The regulation on the Barrage\r\nin low floods, which has gone on steadily since 1899 when Sir Hanbury\r\nBrown used the Barrages in flood for the first time, has enormously\r\nincreased the value of the works, but it has certainly caused the Main\r\nNile to silt, and probably also the branches, owing to a reduced\r\ndischarge and velocity of the silt-bearing water, whose capacity to\r\ncarry on that quantity of silt depends on its velocity. It seems to me\r\nthat unless steps are taken to insure the scouring out of this silt by\r\nthe clear water of November, December and January the consequences will\r\nbe very serious. High floods scour out their beds, but if a very high\r\nflood were to come early before the silt had been scoured out, it might\r\noverflow the banks near Cairo or in the middle reaches of the Nile\r\nbranches in the Delta.\r\n\r\nSir William Garstin has estimated the cost of converting the existing\r\nbasins of Upper Egypt into perennially irrigated land at £7,000,000,\r\nthus made up:--\r\n\r\n  Conversion of Upper Egypt basins            £ 5,000,000\r\n  Two barrages between Assyut and Kena        „ 2,000,000\r\n                                              -----------\r\n                                        Total £ 7,000,000\r\n                                              ===========\r\n\r\nThe resulting land tax from the improved irrigation in Upper or Lower\r\nEgypt he has estimated as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Upper Egypt. {Basin land converted    750,000 acres @ £ ·50 = £ 375,000\r\n               {Land irrigated by pumps 100,000   „   @ £ ·30 = „  30,000\r\n  Lower Egypt.

With these railways and especially the former\r\nin working order, we can arrange for irrigation works for the production\r\nof cotton and wheat for export, knowing that they can be exported at a\r\ncost of transport which will not be absolutely prohibitive. The soil of\r\nthe Sudan along the Blue Nile, the Atbara, the Main Nile and a great\r\npart of the White Nile is the same as that of Egypt itself. It has all\r\ncome from Abyssinia. When at Khartoum last February, I collected\r\nspecimens of typical Gezireh soil from points 10 miles south of Khartoum\r\nand from near Khartoum itself. They were analysed by Mr. Frank Hughes\r\nand reported on by Mr. Foaden.\r\n\r\nThe specimens were numbered as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Typical Gezireh soil from a point 10 miles south of Khartoum near\r\nthe Blue Nile.\r\n\r\n(2) Typical Gezireh soil from a point 2 miles south of Khartoum near the\r\nWhite Nile.\r\n\r\n(3) White Nile side under cultivation in 1904.\r\n\r\n(4) White Nile side below flood level.\r\n\r\n(5) Blue Nile side, not so common as (1).\r\n\r\n(6) The sandy soil generally within 5 miles of Khartoum.\r\n\r\nNos. 1, 2, 5, and 6 are above high flood level of both Niles.\r\n\r\n“The nitrogen and salt were determined in the samples, as received,\r\nwithout drying.\r\n\r\n        Nos.    1     2     3     4     5     6\r\n\r\n  Nitrogen    0·078 0·059 0·062 0·057 0·056 0·052\r\n  Common salt 0·050 0·020 0·010 0·090 0·170 0·020\r\n\r\n“All contain abundance of carbonate of lime; Nos. 1 and 2 might almost\r\nbe called calcareous. All gave a strong reaction for phosphoric acid,\r\nand there is therefore every reason to believe that they are rich in\r\nthis ingredient. So far as the texture of the soils is concerned, little\r\ncan be said except that they differ from those previously examined for\r\nKena Mudirieh, in containing a large amount of coarse sand 1-3 m.m.,\r\nwhich is entirely absent in most Egyptian soils; No. 6 would probably be\r\ntoo light for agricultural purposes in its present condition.\r\n\r\n“The nitrogen is as high as one would expect but is lower than is\r\nnecessary for fertile soils. It would be necessary therefore to\r\nencourage the growth of leguminous crops to increase the quantity of\r\nnitrogen in the soil and to employ nitrogenous manures. It must be borne\r\nin mind that in soils of this class the nitrogen is usually in a highly\r\ninsoluble and un-nitrifiable form.\r\n\r\n“The salt is in no case high; 0.25% is usually considered to be the\r\nlimit for satisfactory growth; all the samples are well below this\r\nlimit.”\r\n\r\nI had complete analyses made of numbers (1) and (2). The results were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                       No. 1    No. 2\r\n\r\n  Silica etc. insol in mineral acid    74.76    73.85\r\n  Lime (Ca.O.)                          6.07     4.56\r\n  Carbonic Acid (C.O.₂)                 3.64     2.40\r\n  Equal to Chalk (Ca.C.O.³)             8.27     5.46\r\n  Potash                                0.23     0.34\r\n  Phosphoric Acid                       0.14     0.12\r\n  Organic Matter                        2.88     4.07\r\n  Nitrogen                              0.075    0.062\r\n      Calculated on soil dried at 100°.\r\n\r\nThough none of these specimens contained salt in excess, Nile deposit in\r\ncertain localities has very large proportions of common salt and\r\nsulphate of soda. The dark soil near the Atbara mouth at El-Damer is\r\nlargely exploited for common salt, while similar soil south of Khartoum\r\nis free from it.\r\n\r\nThe extent of this Nile deposit soil is very great indeed and if\r\nirrigation could be assured, there would be a great future before the\r\nSudan.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Dupuis’s Report which is the last appendix to Sir William\r\nGarstin’s Report, he speaks of this soil as being met with on the Blue\r\nNile, on the Rahad, on the Atbara and on the Gaash. From Khartoum\r\nnorthwards the main Nile flows between berms of this soil.\r\n\r\nThe extent and quality of this soil may therefore be considered as an\r\nundisputed asset of the Sudan. We have next to consider the seasons.\r\n\r\nA reference to tables 76, 77, and 80 will show how much warmer the Sudan\r\nis than Egypt, and any attempt to introduce Egyptian methods into the\r\nSudan without modifications will not at once turn the Sudan into Egypt.\r\nI allow that extensive plains of irrigated land greatly moderate the\r\nheat as they have already done in Middle Egypt; but we have to begin\r\nfrom the beginning in the Sudan, and there are no extensive plains of\r\nirrigated land. Basin irrigation will be a failure in the Sudan unless\r\nit is supplemented by two or three waterings in the winter, for all\r\ncrops except the cheapest and coarsest leguminous crops. Wheat must be\r\nirrigated in winter whether sown in a basin or on the Nile berm, except\r\nin a few choice, low and damp localities. Cotton, on the other hand,\r\nwhich has to be sown in spring in Egypt and reaped in autumn will need\r\nsuch an extraordinary quantity of water to pull it through the summer\r\nthat it will be found preferable to grow it in June with the rising\r\nflood and reap it at the end of the winter. Irrigation therefore from\r\nJune to October for Indian corn, from June to February for cotton, and\r\nfrom November to February for wheat will be essentials of a good harvest\r\nin the Sudan.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the question of the water supply. Unless permits are\r\ngiven for pumps to work from the 15th June to the 15 February, the\r\ncultivation of cotton and wheat on any scale in the northern part of the\r\nGezireh, along the main Nile between Khartoum and Dongola, and on the\r\nlower reaches of the Atbara will be out of the question. Maize and\r\nmillets and some of the coarser leguminous plants might be developed by\r\npumps with permits to work from 15th June to 15th October, but it would\r\npay no one to put up pumps on these terms.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the joint interests of Egypt and the Sudan, though Egypt\r\ncannot spare water between the 15th March and 30th June, which would\r\ncorrespond to 1st March and 15th June in the Sudan; she has enough to\r\nspare for pumps at other times, though she has not always enough to\r\nspare for large free flow schemes in the Sudan. Free flow schemes in the\r\nSudan, except during high and good floods, have however yet to be found.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally we may say that the agricultural success of the Sudan\r\nwill depend on permits for pumping engines to work between the 1st June\r\nand the end of February. There should be no difficulty in the way of\r\nsuch permits being given. We have spoken so far of schemes within the\r\npower of individuals and companies. Of schemes which the Government\r\nalone could carry out by itself or in conjunction with powerful\r\ncompanies, the most promising seem to be those which are connected with\r\nthe 6th cataract. This cataract seems well suited for the construction\r\nof a solid dam to create power and develop electricity to work pumps\r\nbetween it and Khartoum, and some 30 kilometres up the Blue Nile; and if\r\npossible to allow of a canal down the left bank of the Nile as far as\r\nBerber. This project might be studied with advantage and a greater\r\namount of water storage for summer use be also obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX\r\n\r\nSKETCH PLAN OF\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY ABOUT DELGI\r\n\r\nN.W. OF L. TSANA\r\n\r\n_Scale 1 : 50.000_\r\n\r\nLith. Sur. Dep. Cairo.]\r\n\r\nAnother scheme is the construction of a double barrage and weir near Wad\r\nMedani on the Blue Nile, with canals irrigating the Gezireh and the\r\nright bank of the Blue Nile and the Nile to Shabluka. Unfortunately no\r\ncross sections have been taken of the Blue Nile showing how high the\r\nGezireh is above the bed and water surface of the Blue Nile at Wad\r\nMedani. A weir further south would, as Mr. Dupuis states, entail very\r\nexpensive canals to irrigate the lands south of Khartoum.\r\n\r\nMr. Dupuis’s report on the Atbara is not very hopeful. Without\r\nreservoirs this torrential river could insure no crop except millets and\r\nIndian corn. The same may be said for the Gaash. Basins without winter\r\nirrigation would, I think, be most unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nExamining Mr. Dupuis’s figures and sections for the outlet of lake\r\nTsana, I calculate that this reservoir would not supply a fraction of\r\nthe water estimated by Mr. Dupuis. If I were wrong, and I should be\r\npleased indeed to be wrong here, a tunnel along the alignment roughly\r\nsurveyed by Mr. Dupuis, Plate XX, leading the waters of Lake Tsana into\r\nthe Rahad river, and from there under the Blue Nile by a syphon, and\r\nbranch canals irrigating both banks of the Rahad and both banks of the\r\nBlue Nile to Khartoum, would be one of the boldest projects in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that no mention has been made of the tracts between the\r\nfoothills of Abyssinia and Wad-el-Medani which can produce good crops of\r\nIndian corn, millets and even cotton in nine years out of ten with the\r\naid of rain without irrigation. If the land could lend itself to basins\r\nsimilar to those of Bundelkund or to river fed pans as in Madras, a\r\ndevelopment of this country would be possible. Ordinary Egyptian basin\r\nirrigation would be, I think, of no use.\r\n\r\nThe following quotations from a letter written by Messrs. Choremi,\r\nBenachi and Co., of Alexandria, to Mr. Foaden on the 8th February 1904,\r\nwill give an idea of the estimation in which Sudan grown cotton is held\r\nin Alexandria:--\r\n\r\n“The cotton generally is good and superior to any Sudan cotton I have\r\nyet seen. Last year the best I saw was sent by the Sudan Government and\r\ngrown in Miralai Stanton Bey’s garden, with artificial irrigation and\r\nquality was (first picking) class “good”, equal to Beni-Suef or Minieh\r\ncotton, but more woolly. In any case it is saleable cotton for coarse\r\nNos. of Yarn, not what we call Bolton Spinners’ cotton.\r\n\r\n“I now give you the following classification and values compared to\r\nStandard of Full Good Fair Lower Egypt which is the basis of “Futures”\r\nin our Market and Liverpool.\r\n\r\n“On Upper Egypt the outturn in ginning on basis 315 lbs. per cwt. in\r\nseed runs from 100 to 104, and Lower Egypt 105-110 according to province\r\ngrown and quality of seed.\r\n\r\n  No. 1 Outturn  96     Class “good”, value P.T. 5 over Delta fully good\r\n                        fair--colour rather light--good staple, better\r\n                        than Beni-Suef Ashmouni or even Afifi.\r\n\r\n  No. 2   „      98¹⁄₂  Long staple and finish does not look grown from\r\n                       afifi seed but from superior quality, value about\r\n                       P.T. 15 over F.G.F.\r\n\r\n  No. 3   „      99     Class “good”, the seed of this is from\r\n                        Delta because mixed--there is also some\r\n                        Abassi in and does not look as from afifi\r\n                        seed because finer than any afifi grown in\r\n                        Minieh and Beni-Suef, value 5 to 10 over\r\n                        F.G.F.\r\n\r\n  No. 4   „     102¹⁄₂  “Good” in class, from mixed seed--some looks\r\n                        afifi, other better, probably Yannovich\r\n                        seed.

The seed from the non\r\nirrigated Sudan (I suppose near Khartoum) though from good Afifi seed,\r\nalmost becomes unfit for sowing and the quality of this cotton had a\r\nvery poor outturn of about 73%.\r\n\r\n“Rain crops cannot be depended on, because if no rain for some time the\r\nquality will be totally spoilt.\r\n\r\n“I fail to find any trace of sand in the samples--though the common\r\nSudan non-irrigated cotton was very dirty and sandy.”\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from a letter written to me by Ibrahim Effendi\r\nFahmy, originally a student of the Cairo Agricultural College and at the\r\ntime of writing Government agriculturist at Khartoum and on leave in\r\nCairo, will be found interesting.\r\n\r\n“There are three seasons in the Sudan, which are different from those in\r\nEgypt. The seasons are:--1st the winter which extends from the 1st\r\nNovember to the end of February, in this season wheat, beans, barley,\r\nonions, Indian corn and millets are planted: 2nd, the summer which\r\nextends from 1st March to the 15th June, in this season, practically\r\nspeaking, nothing is planted except a small quantity of millets, and in\r\nthe middle of the season from the 1st May to the 15th June all\r\nagricultural work is stopped owing to the great heat and deficiency of\r\nwater: and 3rd, the flood season or “Demera” from the 15 June to the end\r\nof October; in this season the rains fall, the Nile rises and the heat\r\nis decreased, two crops of millets can be taken and cotton, sesame and\r\nearthnuts are sown.\r\n\r\n“Manures are the same as in Egypt.\r\n\r\n“Cotton sown in March, April and May needs so much water through the\r\nsummer that its cost is prohibitive. In the really hot weather it must\r\nbe irrigated every three days. High winds and rain hurt the first open\r\npods, and the pickings are on the 20th August, 20th September and 15th\r\nOctober. After 22 waterings a good field will give 4¹⁄₂ cwt. per acre.\r\n\r\n“Cotton sown in June and July has an even, regular growth. The rains and\r\nmoisture in the air encourage the growth of the plant. The height of\r\nthe flood permits of easy irrigation even when it is lift. The plants\r\ngrow to a great size but have many bolls.

J. L. Beadnell,\r\nF. G. S., F. R. G. S._\r\n\r\n\r\n40. =The Oases.=--The chief oases[6] of the Libyan desert--Dakhla,\r\nKharga, Baharia and Farafra,--occupy extensive depressions cut down\r\nthrough the horizontal Eocene strata[7] to the underlying saddle of\r\nCretaceous rocks; some of the more porous beds of the latter are\r\nwater-bearing and from them, either through natural passages or through\r\nartificial borings, the water rises to the surface, often under\r\nconsiderable pressure. The floor level varies considerably but the\r\ncultivated lands in general lie between 70 and 115 metres above sea\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n  [6] See Geological Survey reports, P.W.M., Cairo.\r\n\r\n  [7] With the exception that Dakhla is almost entirely cut out in\r\n  Cretaceous strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n41. =Dakhla oasis.=--This, by far the most important and prosperous of\r\nthe Egyptian oases, lies three days’ march west of Kharga, or about 300\r\nkilometres due west of Armant in the Nile valley. The site is a\r\ndepression lying at the foot of the great east and west Cretaceous\r\nescarpment, bounded to the south by the undulating desert of Nubian\r\nsandstone, which stretches unchanged almost to the heart of the\r\ncontinent. The inhabitants of Dakhla, numbering over 17,000, are\r\ndistributed among 12 villages and form a practically self-supporting\r\ncommunity. The cultivable land within the oasis (400 square kilometres)\r\namounts to nearly 50,000 acres, of which one half is under cultivation;\r\nin addition several extensive areas of alluvium covered ground exist\r\noutside the oasis proper, notably on the Gabbari road between Dakhla and\r\nKharga. Owing to the difficulty of drainage, salines, saltyland, marshes\r\nand pools occupy some 7,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThere are nearly 130,000 adult palm trees in Dakhla, a large export\r\ntrade in dates being carried on with the Nile valley; the finest crops\r\nof wheat and barley are raised, while the fruits of the oasis, oranges,\r\napricots, mulberries, etc., are abundant and of excellent quality.\r\n\r\nTaxes are levied as follows:--(1) Mature date-palms are taxed 1¹⁄₂\r\npiastres each per annum; (2) Modern wells (i.e. biyâr, made with the\r\nexisting boring plant) pay 50 piastres per annum per qirat of water; (3)\r\nAncient wells (aiyûn) pay the same, except that in some cases those used\r\nfor irrigating palmgroves are exempt. There are 7¹⁄₂ trees and 1¹⁄₂\r\nacres per inhabitant, and the total tax paid by the community is about\r\n£E. 2,500.\r\n\r\nThe water-supply of the oasis is derived from an underground bed of\r\nsandstone, 55 metres thick, underlying a dense impervious red clay 45\r\nmetres in thickness; the upper part of the latter is conspicuous\r\nthroughout the oasis, underlying the alluvium and forming the base of\r\nthe surrounding escarpments in many localities. Below the water-bearing\r\nsandstone lies a black clay, never yet penetrated by the boring rods; it\r\nis probable that other water-tables exist below and such would be\r\ninvaluable for the irrigation of those parts of the oasis where the\r\npresent supply is unsatisfactory. There seem to be no natural springs\r\nextant at the present day, the whole of the water-supply being through\r\nboreholes, both ancient and modern. The old wells, known as _ain_,\r\n_aiyûn_, appear to be mostly of early Egyptian and Roman construction,\r\nand number over 400; exactly similar wells have been sunk by boring\r\nplant during the last few decades and are called _bîr_, _biyâr_; there\r\nare over 160 of these; all are true artesian wells. At the present day\r\nthe method in vogue is as follows:--a two metre square timbered shaft is\r\nsunk by hand to the base of the red clay and within this is built up a\r\nwatertight wooden pipe, 35 cm. in diameter, made of ‘sunt’ (a species of\r\nthorny acacia), the surrounding space being packed with clay. Sinking is\r\ncontinued in the sandstone with the boring machine until a satisfactory\r\nflow of water is obtained. Many of the older wells in the oasis have\r\nbecome choked up, and although some have been successfully cleaned out\r\nby the inhabitants, but the process is costly and laborious and\r\nfrequently fails. The work is done by divers, a small but hardy class\r\nonly found in Dakhla and Farafra.\r\n\r\nThe output of wells is determined in a somewhat rough and ready manner\r\nby measuring the depth of water passing over a weir fixed in the stream.\r\nIt is reckoned in qirats, one qirat being a water-section of 64 square\r\ncentimetres; from some test observations in Kharga Dr. Ball deduced the\r\naverage value of a qirat, as measured in that oasis, as 230 litres a\r\nminute. The total water-output in Dakhla (1096 qirats) may thus be taken\r\nas approximately representing a discharge of 132 million cubic metres\r\nper annum, and taking the cultivated lands as 25,500 acres the duty is\r\n6,130 acres per cubic metre per second. That the water-supply could be\r\nlargely increased, and the limits of cultivation greatly extended, admit\r\nof no doubt, but with the free hand accorded the natives during the last\r\nfew decades a considerable amount of damage has been done throughout the\r\noasis by the injudicious sinking of wells. Promiscuous boring is fatal,\r\nand strict and efficient control of all boring operations imperative.\r\nConsidering the number of wells abandoned owing to a slight fall in the\r\nwater-level having caused them to cease running at the surface, the\r\nimportance of lifting appliances, in the shape of shadûfs, saqias, or\r\nwindmills, is evident, but until a few years ago the oasis was destitute\r\nof such appliances; a number of saqias have recently been fixed in the\r\nvillage of Mushîa and have met with success, but it is not an easy\r\nmatter to persuade the inhabitants to have recourse to lifting\r\nappliances of any description.\r\n\r\nSome of the Dakhla wells are of considerable depth; Bir-el-Dinaria, the\r\nmost northerly in the oasis, is 144 metres deep and its water emerges\r\nwith a temperature of 39·5° C. The best wells yield 9 or 10 qirats,\r\nthough before the modern boring operations the output of some was as\r\nmuch as 16. The terms ‘artesian’ and ‘thermal’ may fairly be applied to\r\nthe Dakhla wells, and it is noteworthy that the temperatures as a whole\r\nincrease from south to north. The thermal character of the springs may\r\nbe considered to be due to the great depths from which the water is\r\nderived, the actual temperature at the point of exit being dependent on\r\nlocal conditions, such as the depth of the well and the rate at which\r\nthe water finds its way to the surface. It is probable that the\r\nwater-bearing table has its outcrop in the rainy regions of Darfur,\r\nalthough some of its water may be derived by direct infiltration from\r\nthe Nile in its upper reaches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE EGYPTIAN OASES\r\n\r\nScale 1 : 6.000.000]\r\n\r\n\r\n42. =Kharga oasis.=--Kharga, the easternmost of the two southern oases,\r\nis a north and south lying depression, mostly bounded by steep and lofty\r\nescarpments but open to the south and south-west. A great part of its\r\nfloor, which is composed of the Nubian sandstone, is buried under sand\r\naccumulations. There are seven principal villages, besides numerous\r\nhamlets and smaller settlements, with a total population of under 8,000.\r\nTaxes are levied as in Dakhla and amount to slightly over £E. 1000. The\r\nadult palm trees in the oasis number about 60,000 and the cultivated\r\nlands have an area of some 4,500 acres, or half an acre and eight palm\r\ntrees per inhabitant. The crops raised do not appear to be sufficient to\r\nsupport the population, as a certain amount of grain is imported from\r\nDakhla. Dates are exported to the Nile valley, though in less quantities\r\nthan from Dakhla and Baharia.\r\n\r\nThe general level of the floor of the oasis lies between 50 and 130\r\nmetres above sea level, though near Qasr Zaiyan a limited area appears\r\nto lie below sea level. Water is met with in most localities on digging\r\nto a moderate depth, but the best supplies are from deep wells; as in\r\nDakhla the majority of the wells are of considerable antiquity, though\r\nsome have been recently made with modern boring plant. With an increased\r\nwater-supply cultivation could be very much extended, as there are large\r\nareas of unoccupied alluvium covered land within the oasis. The same\r\ndifficulties exist in Kharga as in the other oases, though here perhaps\r\naggravated by the encroachments and movements of blown sand, namely, the\r\nlack of control of the wells and water-supply and the apathy of the\r\ninhabitants generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n43. =Baharia oasis=, lying 180 kilometres west of Minia, is a large\r\nnatural excavation 150 metres deep and entirely surrounded by\r\nescarpments. The cultivated lands bear a very small proportion to the\r\ntotal oasis-area; their general level is 110-115 metres above sea level,\r\nrising to 155 metres at Ain-el-Haiss in the southern part of the\r\ndepression. There are four chief villages with a population, inclusive\r\nof outlying settlements, of just over 6,000. The standard of public\r\nhealth in this oasis is low, mainly owing to febrile disorders. The\r\ntotal area of cultivated land is about 2,500 acres (barely ¹⁄₂ an acre\r\nper inhabitant), largely made up of palmgroves; rice, wheat and barley\r\nare grown, but the area sown with cereals has of late years being\r\ndecreasing in extent owing to a diminished output from the springs.\r\nBaharia is _par excellence_ the date-producing oasis of Egypt and very\r\nlarge quantities are annually exported to the Nile valley; besides\r\ndate-palms the gardens contain numbers of olive, apricot and other fruit\r\ntrees. Taxation is on palm trees and land.\r\n\r\nThe water-supply is derived from the Cretaceous sandstones forming the\r\nfloor of the depression, the water rising naturally to the surface of\r\nthe lowest areas. In numerous cases long adits have been driven into the\r\nrock to obtain an increased supply; these tunnels communicate with the\r\nsurface of the ground by a series of air shafts; they mostly date from\r\nearly times. No deep wells appear to exist in the oasis and certainly no\r\nborings have been made in modern times. The fall of the water-level is\r\nprobably due to the gradual choking of the passages; an unsatisfactory\r\nand laborious method of cleaning out wells is in vogue but little\r\ntrouble is taken to prevent the deterioration of the water-supply\r\ngenerally. Practically all the available land in this oasis is under\r\ncultivation, although with the reduced output of the springs the supply\r\nis barely sufficient for efficient irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n44. =Farafra oasis= occupies a large semicircular depression 300\r\nkilometres west of Assiut. The floor is formed of the white chalk at the\r\ntop of the Cretaceous, but at Ain-el-Wadi, a spring in the north part of\r\nthe depression at 26 metres above sea level, the underlying beds are\r\nlocally exposed. The solitary village of Qasr Farafra is situated on the\r\nwestern side at 76 metres above sea level, and contained 542 inhabitants\r\nat the last census. In the entire area there are some 20 springs, mostly\r\ngrouped round the village, each irrigating a small patch of cultivated\r\nground; the total area of the latter, including the few palmgroves,\r\nprobably does not amount to 500 acres. Wheat, barley, durra, rice,\r\nonions and some fruit are grown, and small quantities of dates and\r\nolives are exported; formerly the olives of Farafra were celebrated for\r\ntheir quality, but of late years the trees have deteriorated.\r\n\r\nThe water rises as springs from the white chalk and does not necessitate\r\nthe use of lifting appliances, though the output appears to be\r\ndecreasing through natural causes. There are a few examples of\r\nhorizontal conducting channels of ancient date and two or three of the\r\nsprings appear to have deep vertical shafts as in the ancient wells of\r\nDakhla. Sweet and brackish water-holes occur in several outlying\r\nlocalities within the depression, as well as in the neighbouring little\r\nknown oasis of Iddaila to the west. Owing to the absence of waste pools\r\nand marshy land the climate of Farafra is more healthy than that of the\r\nother oases.\r\n\r\n\r\n45. =The Geology of Egypt=[8]. The north-east corner of Africa, lying\r\nbetween the Red Sea on the east and the sand merged portion of the\r\nLibyan Desert on the west, and stretching from the Mediterranean to the\r\n22nd parallel of north latitude, both in its topographical and\r\ngeological characters is distinctly tripartite, as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) A rugged broken undulating sandstone desert, forming the southern\r\npart of the country;\r\n\r\n(2) Elevated plateaux, for the most part of limestone, stretching from\r\nlat. 25° N. (approximately) to the Mediterranean;\r\n\r\n(3) The mountainous igneous range of the Red Sea Hills, with peaks over\r\n1800 metres (6000 feet) in height.\r\n\r\n  [8] In writing this note at the request of Sir William Willcocks I\r\n  have made free use of all sources, of information, but am chiefly\r\n  indebted to the publications of Schweinfurth and the late Professor\r\n  Zittel, Capt. Lyons, and my past and present colleagues on the\r\n  Geological Survey of Egypt.\r\n\r\nAs a whole one of the most waterless and desolate areas in the world,\r\nthe country is traversed from south to north by a narrow highly\r\ncultivated and thickly populated strip of alluvial land, formed and\r\nwatered by the Nile. In the southern sandstone country the river\r\noccupies only a shallow valley, but to the north flows over the floor of\r\na deep gorge cut down from the surrounding limestone plateaux. On either\r\nside of the river are alluvial plains of varying extent, composed of the\r\nfinest loam, a fertile soil for the most part formed by the\r\ndisintegration of the volcanic rocks of the Abyssinian highlands,\r\nannually denuded by rains and brought down by the Atbara and Blue Nile\r\nfloods and deposited in the lower courses of the river. Unlike most\r\ncountries therefore, the soil of Egypt has no connection with the\r\nunderlying rocks, being entirely of extraneous origin and owing its\r\nexistence absolutely to the peculiar conditions of rainfall in Abyssinia\r\nand the direction of drainage from the watersheds of that country.\r\n\r\n\r\n46. =Igneous rocks.= The most ancient rocks in Egypt are found in the\r\ncentral igneous ranges of the Red Sea Hills and in the crystalline floor\r\nunderlying the sandstones in the southern part of the country.\r\n\r\nIn Nubia the crystalline rocks consist largely of granite and gneiss,\r\nwith associated diorites and schists, traversed by basaltic and felsitic\r\ndykes. Cataracts have been formed at those points where the river\r\ncrosses the hard igneous belts, which may be regarded as the summits of\r\nthe higher ridges of an old eroded continental land surface.\r\n\r\nIn the Red Sea Hills the most ancient rocks are the gneisses, schists,\r\nand slates, constituting the metamorphic series of Jebel Meeteq. Next in\r\nsuccession is a volcanic group, consisting of dolerite and sheared\r\ndiabases in the south and of dolerites, andesites, tuffs and\r\nagglomerates in the north. These volcanic rocks are underlaid and\r\nintruded by still younger quartz-diorites and grey granites, and like\r\nthem are pierced by masses of red granite and dykes of quartz felsite\r\nand dolerite. The red granite is itself traversed by dykes of diabase,\r\nwhich are thus the youngest of all, except for the still more recent\r\nandesitic intrusions into the Eocene limestones (occasional occurrences\r\nof which are met with on the plateaux on both sides of the Nile valley),\r\nand the basaltic sheets which commonly mark the base of the Oligocene\r\nsandstones in the north of the country.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Red Sea Hills igneous complex has been planed down by\r\nmarine erosion, the oldest sedimentary deposits being laid on to the\r\nsmoothed denuded surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n47. =Sedimentary rocks.= Geologically the sedimentary deposits of Egypt\r\nare not of great age. Broadly they consist of a great development of\r\nUpper Cretaceous and Eocene strata, followed by more restricted deposits\r\nof Oligocene and Miocene age, the still younger formations being\r\nrepresented only by comparatively local though important, accumulations.\r\nAs a general rule the different members of the Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\nsucceed each other in regular order from south to north, the strata\r\nbeing undisturbed and dipping northwards at a very low angle.\r\n\r\n\r\n48. =Upper Cretaceous.= The Cretaceous system in Egypt is divisible into\r\nthree main groups, (1) a great thickness of freshwater arenaceous\r\nsediments known as the Nubian Sandstone, of Senonian age in the south\r\n(Dakhla, Nile valley, and southern part of Eastern Desert), and\r\nCenomanian age in the north (Baharia, Abu Roash(?), and Wadi Araba); (2)\r\n300 metres of argillaceous deposits with bone-beds near the base, of\r\nSenonian age; (3) a deep water foraminiferal white chalk (Danian) 60 to\r\n100 metres thick, especially developed in the region of the oases to the\r\nwest of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Nubian Sandstone, the oldest sedimentary deposit in Egypt, occupies\r\na very large area, especially in the south; wherever its base is exposed\r\nand has been critically examined, the sandstone is found to be laid on\r\nto the denuded surface of the underlying crystalline rocks. Thinner\r\nargillaceous bands are almost everywhere associated with the sandstones\r\nand the latter vary much in colour, texture, and hardness. In its widest\r\nsense the term “Nubian Sandstone” includes deposits of much greater age\r\nthan Upper Cretaceous, undoubted Carboniferous fossils having been\r\ndetected in some localities. The formation must be regarded as\r\nrepresenting the slow accumulation of sediment in immense inland lakes\r\nduring a great lapse of time. Although temporary marine invasions left\r\ntheir mark at intervals, it was not until the Cenomanian that continued\r\ndepression caused a steady recession of the shore line from north to\r\nsouth, so that in Senonian times practically the whole of the country\r\nwas occupied by the Cretaceous sea.\r\n\r\nNorth of Silsila in the Nile valley the sandstones gradually give way to\r\na series of flaggy ripple-marked sandstones alternating with sandy\r\nshales and clays, at the top of which are beds rich in bones and\r\ncoprolites of fish, associated with hard oyster-limestones, overlain in\r\nWadi Hammama, E.-N.-E. of Qena, by a limestone containing abundant\r\nremains of cephalopoda; these beds are of Upper Senonian (Campanian)\r\nage. East of Sabaia, in the Nile valley, they are followed by a 200\r\nmetre series of finely laminated clays, separated by bands of marly\r\nlimestone, the greater part of which is of Cretaceous age and homotaxial\r\nwith the _Exogyra_ clays and white chalk (of Campanian--Danian age)\r\nwhich in the southern oases follow on the rich bonebeds overlying the\r\nNubian Sandstone.\r\n\r\nAnterior to and during the deposition of these clayey beds in the south,\r\nthick accumulations of limestone were being formed in the more open sea\r\nto the north and are visible to-day in the Cretaceous area of Abu Roash\r\nnear the pyramids of Giza, (and to a lesser extent in Jebel Shebrewet on\r\nthe Gulf of Suez), where a great complex of limestones of Turonian and\r\nSenonian ages occurs. Finally a deep sea deposit of white chalk forms\r\nthe summit of the Cretaceous throughout the Western Desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n49. =Eocene.= Our knowledge of the junction of the Cretaceous and Eocene\r\nin several parts of the country leaves much to be desired. Where the\r\nEocene is most fully developed its basal member consists of a group of\r\ngreen argillaceous deposits, known as the Esna shales, well seen at the\r\nbase of the cliffs throughout the Esna-Qena reach of the valley. These\r\nbeds everywhere pass conformably upwards into the Lower Eocene (Libyan)\r\nlimestones above, but in the Nile Valley and the Eastern Desert the\r\nexact line of demarcation between them and the lithologically similar\r\nCretaceous clays below is still somewhat obscure. In Kharga and Farafra\r\nthey form a well-marked band between the White Chalk (and associated\r\nclays) at the top of the Cretaceous and the Libyan limestone of the\r\nLower Eocene. The Esna shales may in fact be regarded as passage beds,\r\nand where they exist appear to bridge over the lapse of time which is\r\nrepresented by a decided unconformity between the Cretaceous and Eocene\r\nin the north of the country, as in Baharia Oasis and at Abu Roash.\r\n\r\nThe thick mass of limestone which forms the plateaux and cliffs on both\r\nsides of the valley from lat. 25° N. to Cairo is of Lower Eocene (Libyan\r\nstage) and Middle Eocene (Mokattam stage) age. These limestones,\r\nfrequently nummulitic and typically marine calcareous accumulations,\r\nexceed 500 metres in thickness, and over a wide area are unrelieved by a\r\nsingle band of clay or sandstone. Towards the summit of the Middle\r\nEocene, however, terrigenous deposits were laid down, the Upper Mokattam\r\nconsisting of an alternating series of impure limestones, clays, and\r\nsandstones. In the Fayûm the Middle Eocene is followed by a great\r\nthickness of fluvio-marine deposits of Upper Eocene age, in which the\r\nremains of the animals that inhabited the land to the south and the\r\nadjoining seas at the time are abundantly preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n50. =Oligocene and Miocene.= Throughout Oligocene and Miocene times\r\nconditions similar to those which led to the deposition of the Upper\r\nEocene formation in the Fayûm prevailed, accompanied by a continual\r\nretreat of the sea to the north. In the littoral area marine beds were\r\nintermingled with the sediments brought down by rivers from the land to\r\nthe south; and throughout these deposits the remains of land animals and\r\ngreat quantities of large silicified trees are common. A considerable\r\npart of the deserts east and west of the valley north of lat. 29° 30´ is\r\ncovered with deposits of this age, and shallow water Miocene beds,\r\nunconformably overlying the Eocene, form marked flanking plateaux to\r\nsome of the igneous ranges of the Red Sea Hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n51. =Pliocene, Pleistocene and Recent.= In Pliocene times the relative\r\nareas of land and sea approximated to those of to-day and powerful\r\nearth-movements initiated the formation of the lower part of the Nile\r\nValley. The determining faults and the huge blocks of displaced rock are\r\nvisible along the cliff walls in many parts of the valley, and at\r\nGebelain isolated ridges of highly tilted limestone protrude above the\r\nfloor of the trough, though as a rule, except near the cliffs, the\r\nfaulted rocks are invisible, being buried under great thicknesses of\r\nlacustrine and fluviatile deposits. A few kilometres south of Jebel\r\nSilsila, however, Eocene and Cretaceous limestones are met with at river\r\nlevel in the centre of the valley and point to the Kom Ombo plain being\r\nlet down by a fault of over 400 metres throw.\r\n\r\nThe Nile Valley trough or “grab” became a marine fiord in later Pliocene\r\ntimes, sea-beaches being formed up to 70 metres above present sea level.\r\nExtensive terraces of gravel, perched up on the surrounding slopes of\r\nthe Fayûm, prove that the sea, or a great inland lake, stood at 180\r\nmetres in latest Pliocene or early Pleistocene times. From this time\r\nalso dates the Red Sea (in its modern aspect), the highest Older\r\nPleistocene coral reefs being now found at some 200 metres above\r\nsea-level; younger reefs associated with later Pleistocene gravels occur\r\nat a lower level. In later Pleistocene and early pre-human times, under\r\nthe very moist climate which preceded the present desert conditions, the\r\nNile Valley north of latitude 24° was occupied by a series of deep\r\nfreshwater lakes, perhaps co-existent with that in which the Fayûm\r\ngravel terraces were accumulated. The denudation of the surrounding\r\ncountry was rapid, and tributary streams from the plateaux on either\r\nside brought down fine limestone detritus, which was deposited along the\r\nmargins of the lakes in the form of compact beds of re-made limestone,\r\ninterbedded with frequent layers of conglomerate and gravel, washed down\r\nby the larger streams and by torrential floods. In the quieter parts of\r\nthese lakes clays and calcareous tufas were laid down and are visible\r\nto-day from Kom Ombo to Heluan. Subsequently, owing to the breaking down\r\nof the dividing barriers, or as the result of a general slight\r\nelevation, drainage became more pronounced and the river cut its way\r\ndown through these lacustrine deposits. It was probably at this time\r\nthat, following the partial removal of the gravel ridge between the\r\nFayûm and the valley, part of the drainage obtained access to the Fayûm\r\ndepression and a lake, the precursor of the historical Mœris, was\r\nformed. Subsequently, under climatic conditions similar to those of\r\nto-day, the accumulation of Nile alluvium commenced within the wide\r\ntrough cut out in the older lake beds. Flood plains were formed on\r\neither side of the river, and by successive deposits, at the rate of\r\nabout twelve centimetres a century, were built up to their present\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\n52. =Economic products.= Limestones for building and other purposes are\r\nabundant in the Lower and Middle Eocene formations, though as a rule of\r\nonly medium quality. The chief quarries are those of Jebel Mokattam,\r\nTura, Heluan, Abu Foda, Harîdi, and el-Tarif. At Isawia, near Tahta, a\r\nfine tough freshwater tufaceous limestone of Pleistocene age occurs, and\r\nwas largely used in the construction of the Assiut barrage. Clays of\r\ngood quality are not widely extended, though certain bands of the Esna\r\nshales are very largely used near Qena in the manufacture of pottery.\r\nFor bricks the Nile alluvium is used throughout the country.\r\n\r\nSandstone is quarried for local purposes at J. Ahmar near Cairo and in\r\nseveral localities in the south part of the country; it was formerly\r\nextensively quarried at J. Ahmar for the temples of the Delta, at J.\r\nSilsila for those of Upper Egypt, and at Girtassa, south of Assuân, for\r\nthe Nubian monuments. Although a fairly hard and good weather-resisting\r\nstone when carefully selected, the frequent presence of soft uncemented\r\nand clayey laminae gives it an unreliable character, and a good deal of\r\nthe decay of many of the ancient Egyptian monuments is attributable to\r\nthis cause.\r\n\r\nNumerous rocks in the Red Sea Hills and the Nile Valley were worked in\r\nEgyptian and Roman times for ornamental purposes; among them may be\r\nspecially mentioned the purple imperial porphyry of J. Dokhan, the green\r\nbreccia of Wadis Hammamat and Dib, the dolerite of Wadi Esh, and the\r\nhornblende granite of the first cataract. In modern times local granite\r\nwas used throughout the Assuân dam and an Oligocene basalt is quarried\r\nat Abu Zabel and used for road-metal in the capital and other towns.\r\n\r\nOld workings and mining camps are of common occurrence in many parts of\r\nthe Eastern Desert and there is no doubt that considerable quantities of\r\ngold were extracted by convict labour. The quartz lodes traverse not\r\nonly the metamorphic rocks but also some of the granites. Iron\r\n(hematite, limonite), copper (chrysocolla, copper pyrites) and lead\r\n(galena) bearing veins also occur, and turquoise, jasper and chrysolite\r\nare found in certain localities. Petroleum and sulphur occur sparsely\r\nnear J. Zeit, and gypsum in large quantities in many parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nPhosphate deposits in the form of accumulations of bones, teeth and\r\ncoprolites of fish in compact beds, have a wide distribution in the\r\nEastern Desert, the Nile Valley and the southern oases, though these\r\nbeds have not yet received the attention their importance deserves.\r\nBetter known are the nitrate bearing clays which are so highly valued\r\nand largely used by the fellahin throughout the country. The chief\r\nhorizons are the Esna shales and the underlying cretaceous clays, but\r\ndisintegrated clays of every age are worked throughout the country,\r\nthough their nitrate content may be very low and their salt content\r\nhigh; more prized still is the material from the middens marking the\r\nsites of ancient towns.\r\n\r\nNatron (carbonate of soda) and salt are associated in considerable\r\nquantities in Wadi Natrun, and the latter is widely distributed in\r\nlimited quantities throughout the country, the main supply being however\r\nobtained by evaporation from the shore lagoons along the coast of the\r\ndelta. Rock salt of fine quality occurs in many localities, notably in\r\nthe Eocene limestones three to four days east of Assiut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n                TABLES                                             PAGES\r\n\r\n  A.
