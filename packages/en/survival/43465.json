The restless, inquiring\r\nspirit of youth craves, from its first development, food for the\r\nimagination, and even the simplest nursery rhymes owe their principal\r\ncharm to their wonderful improbability. To these succeed the\r\never-interesting tales of Fairies and Enchanters; and the ardent boy\r\nonly forsakes Ali Baba and Sindbad for the familiar and lifelike\r\nfictions of \"Robinson Crusoe,\" and the hundred pleasant tales on the\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" model which have succeeded that popular romance.\r\n\r\nIt is the nature of man to soar above the common prose of every-day life\r\nin his recreations; from the weary school-boy, who relieves his mind,\r\nafter arithmetical calculations and pages of syntax, by fanciful\r\nadventures amidst scenes of novelty and peril, and returns to his labors\r\nrefreshed, to the over-tasked man of study or science, who wades through\r\nhis days and nights of toil, cheered by the prospect of a holiday of\r\nvoyaging or travelling over new scenes.\r\n\r\nThis spirit of inquiry has usually the happiest influence on the\r\ncharacter of the young and old, and leads them--\r\n\r\n                \"To know\r\n    The works of God, thereby to glorify\r\n    The great Work-Master.\"\r\n\r\nIn this belief, we are encouraged to continue to supply the young with\r\nbooks which do not profess to be true, though they are composed of\r\ntruths. They are doubtless romantic, but cannot mislead the judgment or\r\ncorrupt the taste; their aim being to describe the marvellous works of\r\ncreation, and to lead the devout mind to say with the divine poet,--\r\n\r\n          \"Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite\r\n    Thy power; what thought can measure thee, or tongue\r\n    Relate thee?\"\r\n\r\nA.

Mission to\r\nIndia.--The Orphans of Wendon.--Ruth the Unlucky.--Jack's Project.--The\r\nAddition to the Mayburn Establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am a selfish creature, O'Brien,\" said Mr. Mayburn, the rector of\r\nWendon, to his invalid friend. \"I cannot forbear from coming once more\r\nto annoy you with my lamentations, and to ask your counsel, for I am\r\nmost unhappy. Every object I behold, every word I hear, recalls to my\r\nmind my bereavement. I cannot remain in this place after the loss of my\r\nbeloved wife. She was the moving power of my household. It was she, in\r\nfact, who was the pastor and director of the parish, the skilful tutor\r\nof her children, the guide and the guardian of her weak and erring\r\nhusband. Alone, I am unfit for my responsible office; I shudder over the\r\nconviction that I am faithless to my vows; I know, O'Brien, that I do\r\nnot fulfil my duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is an easy remedy for your distress, my good friend,\" answered\r\nCaptain O'Brien; \"my advice is, do your duty, and be comforted.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is physically impossible, O'Brien,\" said the mourner. \"My nerves are\r\nshattered; my health is completely destroyed. I shrink from communion\r\nwith society; and though I exert myself to give my boys their daily\r\nlessons, I would afterwards gladly enclose myself in my study, and live\r\namongst my books.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you would,\" replied O'Brien; \"but God did not send us into\r\nthis world to vegetate in solitude, and bring forth no fruit. Act,\r\nMayburn, I beseech you, man; power comes with action, you know well; and\r\nwhatever man has done, may be done. Work! work! is the counsel of the\r\nworn-out dying soldier to him who has yet the labors of life spread\r\nbefore him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have no idea how feeble my bodily powers are,\" groaned the\r\nrector.\r\n\r\n\"I can form a very tolerable idea of your strength,\" said the captain;\r\n\"for the last time I was out I saw you plunged up to the knees in the\r\ngreen marsh, regardless of a cold north-east March wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember the day well,\" answered Mr. Mayburn, with animation, \"for I\r\nwas fortunate enough to obtain the eggs of the crested grebe in the\r\nmarsh. You will not have forgotten that the preceding summer I got a\r\nfine specimen of the bird.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said his friend; \"now, if you were able thus to toil and to\r\nendure to save the eggs of a bird, you may surely exert yourself still\r\nmore to save the soul of a Christian. Go more among your poor; talk to\r\nthem, help them with your knowledge, and teach them to live happily and\r\ndie happily. I am not without experience in such work, Mayburn; as long\r\nas I was able, I had a little flock of my own; and in secular matters at\r\nany rate, was a sort of parish priest among my soldiers. I felt an\r\ninterest in the history and in the daily life of every man in my\r\ncompany, and was never more at home than in the nooks and corners where\r\nmy poor fellows dwelt. It was this pleasant and profitable work that\r\nMrs. Mayburn ably accomplished for you, and I see Margaret is treading\r\nin her steps; go with her, Mayburn, support her in her virtuous course,\r\nand you will discover that life has still its pleasures for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not here! not here! my dear O'Brien,\" answered Mr. Mayburn. \"Sometimes\r\nI determine to relinquish this parish, and accept one of smaller\r\npopulation, where the responsibility would be less; at other moments I\r\nam prompted to adopt an entirely opposite course, and to make up for my\r\npast wasted life by devoting my remaining days to missionary labors in\r\ndistant lands, where I might be more stimulated to exertion, in the\r\nnecessity of action. Give me your advice, O'Brien, on which of these two\r\nplans to decide. On the one hand, I have the temptation offered me to\r\nexchange for a small living on the north-eastern coast, where I should\r\nmeet with many ornithological novelties; on the other hand, I know I\r\nhave still sufficient interest among my old friends to obtain the\r\nappointment to some mission in the colonies. I should prefer Northern\r\nIndia or South Australia, both affording rich fields to the naturalist.\"\r\n\r\n\"A matter of secondary consideration,\" said O'Brien, smiling. \"But wait\r\na month or two, my good friend; we must not decide hastily on such an\r\nimportant step; and before that time has elapsed, you will have\r\nfulfilled the last pious offices for me. Do not be agitated, Mayburn. I\r\nknow that I am dying; these old wounds have slowly, but successfully,\r\nundermined the fortress; it cannot hold out long. But be comforted; I am\r\nresigned and calm, nay, I am happy, for I know in whom I trust. Now,\r\nMayburn, to you and to your sweet daughter I must bequeath my wild,\r\nhalf-taught boy. Give him all the book-lore he can be made to imbibe;\r\nabove all, Mayburn, make him a Christian. To Margaret I intrust his\r\nphysical education. I should wish him to be fitted to perform such work\r\nin this world as it may please God to call him to. I am thankful that I\r\nmust leave him poor, as he will thus be exempt from the grand\r\ntemptation, and forced into healthy action. May God direct his labors to\r\nthe best and wisest end.\"\r\n\r\nThe words of his dying friend had for some time a salutary influence\r\nover the amiable but vacillating Mayburn. With remorse and shame he\r\nlooked on his own discontent, and with a brief gleam of energy he turned\r\nto the duties of his office; but long habits of self-indulgence in\r\nliterary pursuits and literary ease were not to be suddenly overcome;\r\nand when the grave closed over his faithful friend and wise counsellor,\r\nO'Brien, he soon shrunk back into morbid, solitary musings, and\r\ngradually sunk into his accustomed indolence. But a waking of remorse\r\ninduced him to write to his old college friend, the Bishop of ----, to\r\npray that he might be allowed to resign his living, and be appointed to\r\nsome distant mission.\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn, though upright in principle and amiable in disposition, was\r\nyet unfitted, from his deficiency in firmness, for the responsibilities\r\nof his office; but his constitutional timidity and indolence had escaped\r\nnotice during the lifetime of his valuable and energetic wife, who had\r\ndirected his actions and concealed his feeble nature. But it was the\r\nwill of God that she should be suddenly called from him; and, stunned\r\nwith his loss, he abandoned himself to sorrow and inaction. The death of\r\nhis valuable friend and counsellor, Captain O'Brien, cut away the last\r\nprop of the feeble man, who was now alternately sunk in useless grief or\r\nhaunted with the horrors of neglected duties.\r\n\r\nPious and eloquent, his people declared he was an angel in the church;\r\nbut in their humble dwellings his visits, like those of angels, \"were\r\nshort and far between.\" In his family, it was his pleasure to\r\ncommunicate to his children the rich treasures of learning that he\r\npossessed; but the lessons of life, the useful preparation for the\r\nbattle of the world, he had not the skill or the energy to teach.\r\n\r\nHis daughter, now sixteen years of age, had been ably instructed by her\r\nexcellent mother, and possessed good sense and prudence beyond her\r\nyears. Arthur, the eldest son, one year younger, had benefited by his\r\nmother's advice and example equally with his sister, whom he resembled\r\nin disposition. His brother Hugh, not yet thirteen years old, was too\r\nyoung to have profited much by instruction, and was more volatile than\r\nMargaret and Arthur. But the children were all frank, true, and\r\nconscientious; and had yet escaped the temptations and perils of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nGerald, the orphan son of the faithful and attached friend of Mr.\r\nMayburn, Captain O'Brien, was the most weighty charge of his timid\r\nguardian; though but twelve years old, he was bold, independent, and\r\nforever in mischief; and hourly did Mr. Mayburn groan under his\r\nresponsibility, for he had solemnly promised to fulfil the duties of a\r\nfather to the boy, and he trembled to contemplate his incapacity for\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\n\"Margaret,\" said he to his daughter, \"I request that you or Jenny will\r\nnever lose sight of that boy after he leaves my study. I am continually\r\ndistracted by the dread that he should pull down the old church tower\r\nwhen he is climbing to take the nests of the harmless daws, or that he\r\nshould have his eyes pecked out by the peacocks at Moore Park, when he\r\nis pulling the feathers from their tails.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not think, papa,\" answered Margaret, \"that you are partly\r\nresponsible for his mischievous follies? You have imbued him with your\r\nornithological tastes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has no taste, Margaret,\" replied her father hastily. \"He has no\r\njudgment in the science. He has never learned to distinguish the\r\n_Corvidæ_ from the _Columbidæ_; nor could he at this moment tell you to\r\nwhich family the jackdaw he makes war with belongs. He is negligent\r\nhimself, and, moreover, he allures my son Hugh from his serious studies,\r\nto join him in rash and dangerous enterprises. He is totally deficient\r\nin the qualities of application and perseverance. I have a dim\r\nrecollection, Margaret, of a childish hymn, written by the pious Dr.\r\nWatts, who was no great poet, but was really an observer of the habits\r\nof the animal creation. This hymn alludes prettily to the industry of\r\nthe bee, and if you could prevail on Gerald to commit it to memory, it\r\nmight suggest reflections on his own deficiencies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Papa,\" said Margaret laughing, \"Gerald could repeat 'How doth the\r\nlittle busy bee,' when he was four years old, and I do not think that a\r\nrepetition of it now would make any serious impression on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has no taste for the higher range of poetry,\" said his distressed\r\nguardian; \"and has too much levity to seek knowledge in the direct\r\npaths. What would you think of giving him to learn an unpretending poem\r\nby Mrs. Barbauld, which describes the feathered tribes with tolerable\r\naccuracy. It commences,\r\n\r\n    'Say, who the various nations can declare,\r\n    That plough, with busy wing, the peopled air!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Gerald is not lazy, papa, he is only thoughtless,\" said Margaret. \"Let\r\nus hope that a few years will bring him more wisdom; then he will learn\r\nto admire Homer, and to distinguish birds like his good guardian.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn sighed. \"But what shall I do with the boy,\" he said, \"when\r\nmy duties summon me to distant lands? I am bewildered with doubts of the\r\nfuture. Will it be right, Margaret, to remove you and my promising boys\r\nfrom country, society, and home, perhaps even from civilization?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, papa, you are not fitted for a missionary to savages,\" answered\r\nMargaret, \"you must choose some more suitable employment. And if you are\r\nbent on quitting England, surely you cannot suppose, whatever may be\r\nyour destination, that we should consent to be separated from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid that it should be so!\" exclaimed the father. \"But I cannot\r\nbut feel, my child, that I have been selfish and negligent. Give me some\r\nconsolation--tell me that you think I may yet do some good in a strange\r\nland. I am persuaded that I shall be better able to exert myself among\r\ncomplete heathens than I am among these cold, dull, professed\r\nChristians.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you feel this conviction, papa,\" said Margaret, \"it is sufficient.\r\nWhen we earnestly desire to do right, God always provides us with work.\r\nWe must all try to aid you. And Gerald is now our brother, papa; he must\r\naccompany us in our wanderings. The boys anticipate with great delight\r\nthe pleasures of a sea-voyage, and I myself, though I regret to leave my\r\npoor people, enjoy the idea of looking on the wonders of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Margaret,\" added Mr. Mayburn, \"I must trust you and Jenny to\r\nwatch that giddy boy, Gerald. Warn him of the dangers that surround him.\r\nI should never survive if he were to fall overboard. I promised O'Brien\r\nmuch; but, alas! I have done little.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret engaged to use all needful watchfulness, though, she assured\r\nher father, Arthur would care for the young boys; and being now\r\nconvinced that her father's resolution to leave England was earnest and\r\nunchangeable, the young girl, assisted by Jenny Wilson, the old nurse,\r\nset about the serious preparations for this important change; and when a\r\nmission to a remote part of India was proposed to Mr. Mayburn, he found\r\nthe whole of his family as ready as he was himself to enter into this\r\nnew and hazardous undertaking.\r\n\r\n\"I looked for nothing better, Miss Marget, my darling,\" said nurse\r\nJenny; \"and my poor mistress, lying on her death-bed, saw it all\r\nplainly. Says she to me, 'Nurse,' says she, 'your good master will never\r\nsettle after I'm gone. He'll be for shifting from this place; but mind\r\nthis, nurse, you'll stick to my childer.' And then and there I said I\r\nwould never leave ye; 'specially you, Miss Marget; where you go, I must\r\ngo, and I hope God will spare me to nurse childer of yours. Though\r\nwhere you are to meet with a suiting match I cannot see, if master will\r\nchoose to go and live among black savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad as that, nurse,\" said Margaret, smiling. \"I trust that our\r\nlot may be cast on a more civilized spot, where we may find many of our\r\nown countrymen living among the benighted people we are sent to teach;\r\nand even they, though ignorant and degraded, are not absolutely savage,\r\nneither are they blacks, my dear nurse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my child, you know best,\" answered Jenny. \"But there's a sore\r\ntask laid out for you, that will have all the work to do. Not but what\r\nmaster is a grand hand at preaching, and can talk wonderful, nows and\r\nthens, to poor folks; but he cannot get round them as you can. He never\r\nseems to be talking to them as it were face to face, but all like\r\npreaching to them out of his pulpit; and somehow he never gets nigh hand\r\nto them. But it's God will, and, please Him, we must all do our best; we\r\nshall be missed here; and oh, Miss Marget, what will come of poor Ruth\r\nMartin? and we promising to take the lass next month, and make a good\r\nservant of her. Here's Jack, too; just out of his time, a fair good\r\nworkman, and a steady lad, and none but you and master to look up to,\r\npoor orphans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be distressed, nurse,\" replied Margaret, \"I have thought of all\r\nmy scholars; I have prepared a list of those I wish papa especially to\r\nrecommend to his successor; and perhaps Mrs. Newton will take Ruth on\r\ntrial.\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't do it, Miss Marget,\" answered Jenny. \"I tried her before, and\r\nshe flounces, and flames, and says all sorts of ill words again the\r\nlass, as how she's flappy and ragged, and knows nothing; and when I\r\nasked her what she could expect from childer as was found crying over\r\ntheir poor father and mother lying dead under a hedge; she said\r\noutright, she should expect they would turn out vagabonds, like them\r\nthey belonged to. Yes, she said that; after you had given the poor\r\nthings schooling for six years.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not the least of Margaret Mayburn's pangs, on leaving Wendon,\r\nthat she must be compelled to abandon the poor children of the parish,\r\nwhom she had long taught and cared for; and she sighed over the\r\nincapacity of the rough orphan girl that she now set out with her\r\nfaithful nurse to visit.\r\n\r\nRuth and Jack Martin had been found one cold morning of winter in a lane\r\nleading to the village of Wendon, sitting by the side of the hedge,\r\nweeping over the dead bodies of their parents, who had perished from\r\nfamine and fever, exposed to the storm of the previous night. The\r\nchildren were conveyed to the workhouse, and from their story, and\r\nfurther inquiries, it was made out that their mother had left a tribe of\r\ngipsies to marry a railway _navvy_, as the children called their father.\r\nHe was a reckless, drunken profligate; and after losing his arm from an\r\naccident which originated in his own carelessness, was dismissed from\r\nhis employment, and driven to wander a homeless vagrant. The children\r\nsaid they had lived by begging, and had often been nearly starved; but\r\ntheir mother would never let them steal or tell a lie, and she had often\r\ncried when their father came to their lodging very drunk, speaking very\r\nbad words, and holding out silver money, which their mother would not\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nBut at last he was seized with a bad fever on the road, and, houseless\r\nand penniless, they crept under a haystack; from thence the children\r\nwere sent to the road-side to beg from passengers, or to seek some\r\nfarmhouse, where charity might bestow on them a little milk or a few\r\ncrusts of bread; but the poor wife sickened of the same disease which\r\nwas carrying off her husband, and in their desperation the wretched\r\nsufferers dragged themselves to the road which led to the village, in\r\nhopes of reaching it, and finding shelter and aid. But it was too late.\r\nIn the midst of the beating snow, and in the darkness of a winter's\r\nnight, the man sank down and died. The wretched woman cast herself down\r\nbeside him, and, overcome by sorrow and long suffering, did not survive\r\nto see the morning light.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy created by this melancholy event procured many warm friends\r\nfor the orphans. They were fed and clothed, sent to school, and\r\ncarefully instructed in that pure religion of which they had formerly\r\nhad but vague notions. Jack, the boy, who was about eleven years of age\r\nwhen they were orphaned, was a thoughtful, industrious lad; for three\r\nyears he made useful progress at school, and in the last three years,\r\nunder a good master, he had become a skilful carpenter. Ruth, who was\r\ntwo years younger than her brother, had inferior abilities; she was\r\nrough, boisterous, and careless; and was ever the dunce of the school,\r\ntill at length the schoolmistress begged she might be put to something\r\nelse, for she declared she made \"no hand at learning.\" She was then\r\nplaced with an old woman, who daily complained that \"the lass was of no\r\nuse; she was willing enough; but if she was set to wash the cups, she\r\nbroke them; and she could not even stir the fire but she would poke it\r\nout.\" At fifteen years old, Ruth was a strong, active girl, extremely\r\ngood-natured, true, and honest, fondly attached to her brother, and\r\ndevoted to her kind friends at the rectory; yet, certainly, Ruth was no\r\nfavorite with the wives of the neighboring farmers, who unanimously\r\nagreed that she must have \"two left hands,\" she was so awkward in all\r\nher undertakings. Under these untoward circumstances, it had been\r\narranged that Ruth should undergo an apprenticeship in the rectory\r\nestablishment, to fit her for household service. This event was looked\r\nforward to by the girl with great delight, and it was with much regret\r\nthat Margaret set out to announce to her their plan of leaving Wendon,\r\nwhich must necessarily extinguish her hopes of preferment.\r\n\r\nThere was still another who would deeply feel their loss; and Margaret\r\nwas accompanied by her brothers, who were anxious to see their untiring\r\nassistant, Jack. It was he who gave his useful aid to them in the\r\nconstruction of bows, bats, leaping-bars, and all the wooden appliances\r\nof school-boy sports; and above all the people of the village, the boys\r\nmurmured most that they must part with Jack.\r\n\r\nThey found the industrious lad busily engaged in making a new crutch for\r\nNanny, the old woman with whom the orphans lived. \"You see, Master\r\nHugh,\" said he, \"poor Ruth happened to throw down Nanny's crutch, and\r\nthen the careless lass fell over it, and snapped it. I reckon it had\r\nbeen a bit of bad wood; but this is a nice seasoned stick I've had laid\r\nby these two years for another purpose, and it comes in nicely; for\r\nNanny was cross, and poor Ruth was sadly put about, and this will set\r\nall straight.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Ruth, who had been sent out to milk Nanny's cow,\r\nentered in woful plight. She had neglected to tie Brindle's legs\r\nproperly, and the animal, irritated by the teasing bark of an ill-taught\r\nlittle dog, had struggled to extricate itself, kicked Ruth into the mud,\r\nand the milk-pail after her, and then run off, pursued by its tormentor;\r\nand the girl returned with her dress torn and dirty, and her milk-pail\r\nempty. Nanny scolded, Jack shook his head, Margaret gently remonstrated\r\nwith her for her carelessness, and, worst cut of all, the young\r\ngentlemen laughed at her. Then Ruth fairly sat down and cried.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Nanny,\" said Margaret, \"you must look over Ruth's fault this\r\ntime, for we have some sad news for you all. We are going to leave\r\nWendon.\"\r\n\r\nJack threw down his work, and Ruth, forgetting her own vexation, held up\r\nher hands, crying out, \"Not without me, please, Miss Marget. You\r\npromised to try and make me good for something; please do, Miss Marget,\r\nand I'll pray God to make me of some use to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Ruth,\" said Hugh, \"we are going far away from here, across the\r\nwide sea, and among people who neither talk, nor look, nor live as we\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many legs have they, Master Hugh?\" asked the awe-struck girl.\r\n\r\n\"Only two legs, and one head, Ruth,\" answered he, laughing; \"and we feel\r\npretty sure that they will not eat us; but, for all that, I am afraid\r\nthey are a little bit savage, if they be roused.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be so kind as to tell me, Mr. Arthur,\" said Jack, \"where you\r\nmay be going really.\"\r\n\r\nArthur then explained to Jack the plans of Mr. Mayburn, and assured him\r\nthey all felt a pang at leaving Wendon; and especially they regretted\r\nthe parting from the children they had themselves assisted to teach.\r\n\r\n\"Then let us go with you,\" cried Ruth vehemently.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot we both work and wait on you? If I stay here I shall be sure to\r\nturn out a bad lass. Jack, honey, we'll not be left behind, we will run\r\nafter Miss Marget and Mr. Arthur.\"\r\n\r\nJack was thoughtful and silent, while Margaret said to the weeping\r\ngirl,--\"If we had only been removing to any part of England, Ruth, we\r\nwould have taken you with us, if it had been possible; but we dare not\r\npropose such an addition to the family in a long voyage, which will cost\r\na large sum of money for each of us; besides this, we are going to a\r\ncountry where your services, my poor girl, would be useless; for all the\r\nservants employed in cooking, house-work, and washing, are men, who bear\r\nthe labor, in such a hot climate, better than women could.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, Miss Margaret,\" said Jack, eagerly, \"I have thought of\r\nsomething. Will you be kind enough to tell me the name of the ship you\r\nare to go in, and I will get my master to write me out a good\r\ntestimonial, and then I will seek the captain, to offer to work for my\r\npassage and for that of poor Ruth, if you will agree to try her; for you\r\nsee, Miss Margaret, we must never be parted. And when once we're landed,\r\nplease God, we'll take care to follow you wherever you may go.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret was deeply affected by the attachment of the orphans; and\r\nthough she felt the charge of Ruth would be a burden, she promised to\r\nconsult her father about the plan, and the brother and sister were left\r\nin a state of great anxiety and doubt.\r\n\r\nAs they walked home, Margaret and Arthur talked of Jack's project till\r\nthey satisfied themselves it was really feasible; and Arthur believed\r\nthat, once landed in India, the lad might obtain sufficient employment\r\nto enable him to support himself and his sister.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack will be a capital fellow to take with us,\" said Hugh. \"I know\r\npapa will consent, for he could always trust Jack to find the birds'\r\nnests, and bring away the right eggs, as well as if he had gone himself.\r\nThen he is such an ingenious, clever fellow, just the man to be cast\r\naway on a desolate island.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust we shall never have occasion to test his talents under such\r\nextreme circumstances,\" said Arthur; \"but, if we can manage it, I should\r\nreally like Jack to form a part of our establishment. As to that\r\nluckless wench, Ruth, I should decidedly object to her, if we could be\r\ncruel enough to separate them, which seems impossible. But I shall\r\nalways be haunted with the idea that she may contrive, somehow, to run\r\nthe ship upon a rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! do let us take Ruth, Meggie,\" exclaimed Gerald; \"it will be such\r\nfun. Isn't she a real Irish girl, all wrong words and unlucky blunders.\r\nWon't she get into some wonderful scrapes, Hugh?\"\r\n\r\n\"With you to help her, Pat Wronghead,\" replied Hugh. \"But mind, Meggie,\r\nshe is to go. Papa will say what you choose him to say; and I will\r\ncajole nurse out of her consent.\"\r\n\r\nAnd serious as the charge was likely to become, it was at length agreed\r\nthat Jack and Ruth should be included in the party with the Mayburns;\r\nand the girl was immediately transferred to the rectory, to undergo a\r\nshort course of drilling previous to the momentous undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDeparture from Wendon.--Embarkation in the _Amoor_.--Ruth's\r\nAdventures in London.--The Deverell Family.--The Pleasures of the\r\nVoyage.--Tropical Wonders.--The Flying-fish.--The Stormy Petrel.--The\r\nAlbatross.--Deverell's Plans.--The Indian Ocean.--A Storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally the successor of Mr. Mayburn arrived, was initiated in his\r\noffice, introduced to his new parishioners, and had promised to supply,\r\nas well as he was able, the loss which the mourning poor must sustain in\r\nthe departure of the charitable family. Mr. Mayburn's old friend, the\r\nBishop of ----, himself accompanied the family to London, directed them\r\nin the mode of fitting out for the voyage, and for their new residence,\r\nand supplied them with letters of instruction as well as of introduction\r\nbefore he left them. Some weeks of delay followed, and several\r\ndisappointments; but at length they were induced to embark, with nurse\r\nWilson, Ruth, and Jack, on board the _Amoor_, a good sailing vessel\r\nbound to Melbourne, with many passengers; and from thence to Calcutta,\r\nwith cattle and merchandise; Captain Barton, who commanded the ship,\r\nbeing an old acquaintance of Mr. Mayburn. Established in a large and\r\ncommodious cabin, Margaret begged that nurse would keep Ruth always with\r\nthem, for the girl was distracted with the strange objects around her.\r\n\r\n\"Sit ye down, lass, and hem that apron,\" said Jenny, in a tone of\r\nauthority. \"Truly, Miss Margaret, I wouldn't go through the last week\r\nagain to be Queen Victoria herself, God bless her; and all owing to that\r\nunlucky lass. Jack is a decent lad, and it's unknown what a help he was\r\nabout getting the things here safe; but all the folks in London seemed\r\nof one mind that _she_ was fitter for a 'sylum than for a creditable\r\ngentleman's family. It's no good blubbering about it now, girl; just see\r\nand mind what you are about, for there's no police here to look after\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the police really get hold of her, nurse?\" asked Gerald. \"What\r\nfun!\"\r\n\r\n\"I never took her out for a walk, Master O'Brien,\" answered Jenny, \"but\r\nthey had their eye on her; they marked her at once as one that needed\r\nwatching--a simpleton! Why, it was no later than yesterday morning when\r\nshe worked on me, fool-body as I was, to go with her to see St. Paul's;\r\nand what did she do then but start from my arm and run right across a\r\nstreet thronged with cabs, and wagons, and omnibuses. I just shut my\r\neyes and screamed, for I never thought to see her again living; and\r\nthere was such a hallooing among coachmen and cabmen, and such screaming\r\nof women, as was never heard. How they got all them horses to stop is\r\njust a miracle; but when I looked again, there was a lot of police\r\nholding horses' heads, and one man was hauling Ruth right across; and he\r\nhad his trouble, for when she heard all that hullabaloo, she was for\r\nturning back to me through the thick of it. Oh! Miss Marget, wasn't I\r\nshamed out of my life when they fetched her back to me at last, and one\r\nfine fellow said I had better lead my daughter in a string.\"\r\n\r\nRuth giggled hysterically at the recital of her adventure, and when\r\nMargaret said to her gravely,--\"You behaved very improperly, Ruth, why\r\ndid you leave your kind friend, Mrs. Wilson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please Miss Marget,\" sobbed the girl; \"it was a window full of bonnie\r\nbabbies.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's just a babby herself, Miss Marget,\" said Jenny, wrathfully. \"It\r\nwas a fine toyshop she saw, and she had no more sense but run among\r\ncarriages to it. She's hardly safe shut up here; see if she doesn't\r\ntumble into the sea some of these days.\"\r\n\r\nBut when Ruth's curiosity and astonishment had somewhat subsided, the\r\nquiet and firm government of Margaret, and the watchful care of Jack,\r\nhad great power over her; though still the wild boys Hugh and Gerald\r\nsometimes tempted her to pry into forbidden places, or to join them in\r\nsome mischievous frolic.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the accommodation of the _Amoor_ was given up to a\r\ngentleman of good birth and property, who was emigrating to Australia.\r\nHe had obtained a grant of an immense tract of land in the very midst of\r\nthe country, further north than the steps of the colonists had yet\r\nreached. To this remote district he was taking his mother, his young\r\nsister, and a younger brother who had studied medicine; and besides\r\nthese, a number of male and female servants, carpenters, smiths,\r\nbuilders, drainers, shepherds, and various workmen likely to be useful\r\nin a new colony. These men were accompanied by their wives and children,\r\nforming a considerable clan, all depending on their worthy and energetic\r\nchieftain. The vast amount of goods brought out by all these emigrants,\r\nmuch that was useless, as must ever be the case, among the useful, had\r\nheavily laden the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe Mayburns and Deverells were drawn together as much by kindred taste\r\nas by inevitable circumstances, and they soon became as true friends as\r\nif they had been intimately acquainted for years. Edward Deverell, with\r\npromptness and practical knowledge, managed the affairs and smoothed the\r\ndifficulties of the Mayburns; while Mr. Mayburn instructed the ignorant,\r\nand, at the desire of the captain, a right-minded man, daily read the\r\nmorning and evening services publicly--a most beneficial practice,\r\nproducing order and decorum, and implanting in the minds of the young\r\nthe seeds of future blessing.\r\n\r\n\"How truly I should rejoice, dear Margaret,\" said Deverell, \"if we could\r\ninduce your excellent father to join our expedition. I would then\r\nundertake to build a church; and might hope for a blessing on my new\r\ncolony, if the foundation were so happily laid. The climate is declared\r\nto be exceedingly salubrious, much more likely to suit you all than the\r\nunhealthy air of India. It would be an inestimable advantage to my dear\r\nsister Emma; she has never known the care and tenderness of a sister;\r\nshe needs a more cheerful companion than her good mother, who has\r\ndelicate health; and you, Margaret Mayburn, are the model I should wish\r\nher to imitate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need a sister quite as much,\" answered Margaret, \"to soften my rough\r\npoints, and your gentle, gay little Emma charms and interests me; but,\r\nalas! papa has accepted a duty which he must not relinquish without a\r\ntrial to fulfil it. I regret that it should be in such a locality for\r\nthe sake of my brothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, my dear friend,\" replied he; \"observe how happily they\r\nare now engaged. Arthur has looked over the dried plants, and he is now\r\ndissecting rabbits with my brother. Hugh and your ingenious Jack\r\nare at work with my carpenters, making models of broad-wheeled\r\ntravelling-wagons and canoes for the rivers. Even the mischievous urchin\r\nO'Brien is out of danger when he is engaged with my grooms and herdsmen,\r\nin attendance on my valuable horses and cattle. What can these ardent\r\nboys find to interest and amuse them in the arid and enfeebling plains\r\nof India?\"\r\n\r\nMargaret knew that if her father heard these arguments, they would\r\ncertainly agitate him, and might even shake his determination to proceed\r\nin the undertaking, which she and Arthur were of opinion he was bound to\r\ncomplete. She therefore begged Deverell to use no further persuasions;\r\nbut she promised him, that if the Indian mission was beyond the physical\r\nor mental strength of her father, she would try to induce him to return\r\nto Melbourne, and from thence they would endeavor to make their way to\r\nthe station of Mr. Deverell, who had promised to leave directions for\r\ntheir progress with his banker at Melbourne, which he proposed to make\r\nhis mart for business.\r\n\r\nIt was truly the fact, that in pleasant employment no one found the long\r\nvoyage tedious. Jack was especially charmed with his increase of\r\nknowledge. \"You see, sir,\" said he to Arthur, \"I was qualified to make a\r\nfour-post bedstead, or a chest of drawers, as well as the best of these\r\nchaps; but they tell me them sort of things isn't much needed in them\r\nforrin parts. But what they've brought along with them is quite another\r\nthing: frames for wooden houses, ready to nail up in no time; mills and\r\nthreshing machines; great, broad-felloed wagons for their rough roads,\r\nand boats of all makes. Just look, Mr. Arthur, I've made bits of models\r\nof all them things, you see. We can't say but they may turn up useful\r\nsome day.\"\r\n\r\nEven Ruth the unlucky lost her cognomen, and became popular among the\r\nemigrant women; for when kept quietly at regular employment, she could\r\nbe steady and useful; it was only when she was hurried, or thrown upon\r\nher own responsibility, that she lost her head, and blundered into\r\nmischief. She nursed the babes tenderly and carefully, helped the poor\r\nwomen to wash their clothes, and for the first time in her life began to\r\nbelieve she might be of some use in the world. Gerald, who always\r\ninsisted on it that Ruth was not half so bad as she was represented,\r\nassured Jenny that all the girl's errors arose from improper management.\r\n\"You do not appreciate her talents justly, nurse,\" said he. \"She is\r\nquite a genius, and ought to have been Irish, only she was born in\r\nEngland. You have wronged poor Ruth; you see she has never drowned a\r\n_babby_ yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Master O'Brien, wait a bit, we're not through our voyage yet,\"\r\nsaid Jenny, oracularly.\r\n\r\n\"The Ides of March are not gone, she would say,\" said Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean to say no such thing, Master Hugh,\" replied she; \"you're\r\nso sharp with one. I'm not so daft, but I know March is gone, and\r\nMay-day ought to be at hand; not that we can see any signs of it,\r\nneither leaves nor flowers here, and I cannot see days get any longer.\r\nHow is it, Master Arthur? Is it because we're atop of the water?\"\r\n\r\nArthur endeavored to make Jenny comprehend the natural consequences of\r\ntheir position, now within the tropics, and daily drawing nearer to the\r\nequator; but he only succeeded in agitating the mind of the old woman,\r\nwithout enlightening her.\r\n\r\n\"God help us!\" she exclaimed. \"Nigher and nigher to the sun! It's\r\ndownright temptation and wickedness, my dears; and my thought is, one\r\nought to stay where it has pleased Him to plant us. And think ye, Master\r\nArthur, we shall all turn black, like them niggers we saw in London\r\nstreets.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; certainly not, nurse,\" answered Arthur. \"It requires hundreds of\r\nyears, under a tropical sun, to change the color of Europeans. Besides,\r\nthe negroes, although we are all children of Adam, are of a distinct\r\nrace from us. We are certainly not, like the thick-lipped negroes, the\r\ndescendants of Ham.\"\r\n\r\n\"Likely he had been the plainest of Noah's family,\" said Jenny, \"for\r\nbeauty runs in the blood, that I'll stand to,\" continued the attached\r\nnurse, looking round with complacency on her handsome young nurslings.\r\n\r\nTo the young voyagers there was an indescribable charm in the novelties\r\nwhich the sea and the air offered to them in the tropical region they\r\nhad now entered. Now for the first time they beheld the flying-fish rise\r\nsparkling from the waves, to descend as quickly; escaping for a short\r\ntime from its enemies in the waves to expose itself to the voracious\r\ntribes of the air, who are ready to dart upon it. And sometimes the\r\nelegant little Stormy Petrel, with its slender long legs, seemed to walk\r\nthe waters, like the fervent St. Peter, from whom it derives its name.\r\n\r\n\"But is not this bird believed to be the harbinger of storms?\" asked\r\nMargaret of her father, as he watched with delight the graceful\r\ncreature he had so often desired to behold.\r\n\r\n\"Such is the belief of the sailors,\" answered he, \"who have added the\r\nill-omened epithet to its name. It is true that the approach, or the\r\npresence, of a gale, has no terror to this intrepid bird, the smallest\r\nof the web-footed tribe. It ascends the mountainous wave, and skims\r\nalong the deep hollows, treading the water, supported by its expanded\r\nwings, in search of the food which the troubled sea casts on the\r\nsurface:\r\n\r\n            'Up and down! up and down!\r\n    From the base of the wave to the billow's crown,\r\n    Amidst the flashing and feathery foam,\r\n    The Stormy Petrel finds a home,'\r\n\r\nas a poet who is a true lover of nature has written. Yet it is not\r\nalways the harbinger or the companion of the storm, for even in the\r\ncalmest weather it follows a vessel, to feed on the offal thrown\r\noverboard, as fearless and familiar in the presence of man as the pert\r\nsparrow of London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, papa!\" cried Hugh, \"here is a new creature to add to your\r\ncollection. I know him at once,--the huge Albatross.\"\r\n\r\nWith the admiration of a naturalist, Mr. Mayburn looked on the gigantic\r\nbird, continuing its solemn majestic flight untiringly for hours after\r\nthe ship, its keen eye ever on the watch for any floating substance\r\nwhich was thrown from the vessel, and then swooping heavily down to\r\nsnatch the prize voraciously, and circling round the ship, again to\r\nresume its place at the wake.\r\n\r\n\"I see now,\" said he, \"why Coleridge wrote,--\r\n\r\n    'The Albatross did follow,\r\n      And every day, for food or play.\r\n    Came to the mariner's hollo!'\r\n\r\nBut the poet mistook the habits of the bird entirely when he added, that\r\n'on mast or shroud it perched.' The difficulty of expanding its wing of\r\nfive joints, so immensely long, would impede its rising from the mast of\r\na ship; it scrambles along the waves before it can rise above them; and\r\nit has been well said, 'The albatross is the mere creature of the wind,\r\nand has no more power over itself than a paper kite or an air balloon.\r\nIt is all wing, and has no muscle to raise itself with, and must wait\r\nfor a wind before it can get under sail.'\"\r\n\r\nThe family were assembled on deck in the close of the evening, after the\r\nfervid heat of an equatorial sun, and they beheld with enjoyment the\r\nwonders of the deep; but the old nurse seemed disturbed and awe-struck.\r\n\r\n\"Every thing seems turned topsy-turvy here,\" said she. \"Days far hotter\r\nnor ever I mind them, and May-day not come; fishes with wings, flying as\r\nif they were birds, and birds walking atop of the water, as if it were\r\ndry land. It's unnatural, Miss Marget, and no good can come on it, I\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! if you were but going with us, Mrs. Wilson,\" said Charles Deverell;\r\n\"then I would engage you should see wonders. You should see beasts\r\nhopping about like birds, and wearing pockets to carry their young ones\r\nin; black swans and white eagles; cuckoos that cry in the night, and\r\nowls that scream by day; pretty little birds that cannot sing, and bees\r\nthat never sting. There the trees shed their bark instead of their\r\nleaves, and the cherries grow with the stone outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, just hold your tongue, Mr. Charles,\" answered nurse, angrily.\r\n\"Your brother would scorn to talk such talk; but you're no better than\r\nMaster Gerald, trying to come over an old body with your fairy stories.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite true, Mrs. Wilson,\" said Emma Deverell, \"and I wish you\r\nwere all going with us into this land of enchantments. Then, Margaret,\r\ndear Margaret, how happy we should be. You should be queen, and we all\r\nyour attendant sylphs, and\r\n\r\n    'Merry it would be in fairy-land,\r\n    Where the fairy birds were singing.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Merry for you, little wild goose,\" said her brother Edward; \"but\r\nCharles has told you the fairy birds do not sing; and our sylph-life\r\nwill be one of hard labor for many months before we make our fairy-land\r\nand court lit to receive our queen. Then we must try and lure her to us.\r\nHow shall we contrive it, Emma?\"\r\n\r\nMargaret smiled and shook her head. \"Too bright a dream,\" said she, \"to\r\nbe safely indulged in. But you must tell us all you propose to do, and\r\nwe will watch your progress in fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do tell us all about it, Edward,\" said Hugh. \"But, first of all,\r\nmake a dot upon my map, that we may know where you are when we come to\r\nseek you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very prudent, Hugh,\" answered Edward, \"though I doubt the accuracy of\r\nmy dot on this small map; but I suppose I shall not be more than a\r\nhundred miles wrong, and that is nothing in the wilds of Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I see you will be close on this great river that falls into the\r\nDarling,\" said Hugh; \"so if we only follow up the rivers, we must find\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not find that so easy a task as it seems, my boy,\" replied\r\nEdward. \"Neither are we, as you suppose, close on that river, but fifty\r\nmiles from it; but we have a charming little river laid down on our\r\nplan, which we must coax and pet in the rainy season, that it may\r\nprovide us with water in the drought.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a most extensive tract,\" said Arthur, looking on the plan.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Charles, \"we propose, you know, to build a castle for\r\nourselves, and a town for our vassals.\"\r\n\r\n\"There lies my castle,\" said Edward, pointing to some large packages\r\nwhich contained the frame of his future abode. \"As for the town, I am\r\nnot without hopes to see it rise some time, and do honor to its name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deverell, I conclude?\" observed Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"So my mother wishes the station to be called,\" replied he; \"but my own\r\n'modest mansion,' I should wish to name Daisy Grange.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never understood that the daisy was indigenous in Australia,\" said\r\nMr. Mayburn.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it is not, sir,\" answered Edward; \"but we have fortunately\r\nbrought out a number of roots of this dear home flower, and will try to\r\ndomesticate them in our new country; though I fear they will be apt to\r\nforget their native simplicity, and learn to flaunt in colors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know why you wish to call your house Daisy Grange, Edward,\" said\r\nEmma, nodding sagaciously at Margaret, and the general laughter showed\r\nthe little girl had surmised correctly.\r\n\r\n\"A very pretty and delicate compliment,\" said Mr. Mayburn: \"our own\r\nglorious Chaucer speaks of the daisy as--\r\n\r\n              'La belle marguerite,\r\n    O commendable flower, and most in minde;'\r\n\r\nand the noble Margaret of Valois, a Christian and a scholar, had the\r\ndaisy, or _marguerite_, worn in honor of her name, and is herself\r\nremembered as the 'Marguerite of Marguerites'.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus they amused themselves till, without storm or delay, they had\r\ncrossed the equator, and entered the South Sea, when a new source of\r\nenjoyment was opened to Mr. Mayburn, who had long desired to view the\r\nconstellations of the south; and favorable weather enabled them to study\r\nastronomy every night. Never for a moment did the voyage seem tedious in\r\nthe cheerful society of the happy families, and all things concurred to\r\nrender it agreeable. The provisions were excellent, fresh meat and\r\nbread, with milk in abundance, prevented them from suffering from change\r\nof diet; and constant employment made the moments fly. In the morning\r\nthe young Mayburns, with Emma Deverell, read with Mr. Mayburn, and\r\nstudied Hindostanee; and in the evening they walked on deck, listening\r\nto the pleasant anecdotes told by Edward Deverell, who had been a great\r\ntraveller. Then they had music, and occasionally dancing; and if\r\nsometimes a light gale tossed the vessel, or swept the dinner from the\r\ntable, the _contretemps_ caused mirth rather than wailing. Mr. Mayburn\r\nhimself, busily engaged in teaching, lecturing, or in writing and\r\ndelivering simple sermons to the poor emigrants, recovered his\r\ncheerfulness, and once more began to confide in himself.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in good time, they reached the Cape, and Jenny discovered that\r\nnow, \"when May-day was turned,\" it was far colder than any May-day in\r\nEngland, and put on her warm shawl to land with her young charge to see\r\nthe town, and to look after that \"feckless Ruth.\" It was a great\r\npleasure to the ardent young people to set their feet on the shores of\r\nAfrica, to see the vessels of many nations crowding the harbor, and the\r\npeople of many countries thronging the busy streets, to make excursions\r\nto the mountains and vine-covered hills around, and to collect the\r\nbotanical treasures of a new and fertile region. Mr. Deverell was more\r\nusefully engaged with his herdsmen and shepherds, in completing his\r\nstock of cattle and sheep, and in making other purchases for his great\r\nundertaking; and thus many days were spent pleasantly and profitably.\r\n\r\nOnce more embarked, a shade of melancholy was perceptible--among the\r\nyoung especially--as they daily approached nearer to the shores where\r\nthey must be separated; for the two families, so kindred in taste and\r\ndisposition, had become truly attached during their long voyage; and\r\nnotwithstanding the pleasant prospect of new scenes and pursuits, they\r\nwere less cheerful every day. Even Edward Deverell, with his mind\r\ncrowded with plans for clearing, draining, cultivating, sheep-shearing,\r\nand tallow-melting, felt deep regret at the prospect of separation from\r\nthe lively, intelligent boys, and their amiable and sensible sister; and\r\nMargaret herself, usually so composed and contented, sighed to think she\r\nmust lose the valuable counsel of Edward, the friendly protection of his\r\nmild invalid mother, and the warm affection of the sprightly Emma; and\r\nevery evening, as they walked on deck, they indulged hopes, and sketched\r\nplans of meeting again.\r\n\r\nAfter they had entered the Indian Ocean, they had no longer the\r\nfavorable and pleasant breezes they had so long enjoyed, and while Hugh\r\nand Gerald were anxiously looking out for pirates, and talking of\r\nMalays, of prahus, and of kreeses, the sailors were watching the signs\r\nof the sky, wrestling with contrary winds, and guarding against sudden\r\ngales.\r\n\r\n\"How vexatious,\" said Hugh, \"to be drifted about every way but the right\r\nway, and to have all this noise and splashing and dashing, and yet\r\nnothing to come of it. Now if we had a grand regular storm, and a\r\nshipwreck, and were all cast away on an uninhabited island, it would be\r\nan adventure; there would be some life in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"More likely there would be death in it,\" said Margaret. \"Do not be so\r\npresumptuous, unthinking boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should enjoy the thing amazingly myself, Margaret,\" said Gerald; \"so\r\ndon't you look grave about it. Or what would you think, Hugh, if a great\r\nfleet of prahus were to surround us and try to board us, while we, armed\r\nand ready for them, were to pour our shots into them, and put the rogues\r\nto flight. But first we would take care to capture the fierce pirate\r\ncaptain, and take possession of all his treasures. Then wouldn't we\r\nenter Melbourne in triumph, and have the robber hauled up to the\r\ngallows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pirates do not usually carry their treasures about in their prahus,\"\r\nsaid Arthur; \"nor do I think it is at all desirable that we should\r\nencounter a piratical fleet. Where are your guns to pour down\r\ndestruction on the foe, Master Gerald?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, murther!\" cried the wild boy, \"wasn't I forgetting the guns! Now,\r\nwhat for did we come in a merchantman, as quiet and dull as a quaker?\r\nWell, well, Arty, we have plenty of brave fellows, and our own rifles\r\nand pistols, besides knives and dirks. We should defend ourselves like\r\nBritons, I'll be bound.\"\r\n\r\nBut the next day there was no cause to complain of dulness, for a real\r\ngale came on, and all was confusion. The wind roared, the waves rose\r\ntremendously, the ship rolled fearfully in a heavy sea, and before night\r\nthe maintop-gallant was carried away. Then sail was reduced; but louder\r\nand stronger grew the tempest amid the darkness of night. Mast after\r\nmast was rent away, and the crippled vessel continued to drift\r\nhelplessly for twenty-four hours, when the violence of the gale began to\r\nabate. Signals of distress were made, but long in vain. At length a\r\nvessel appeared in sight, and distinguishing their signals, made up to\r\nthem. It was bound to Melbourne, which was now within a few days' sail,\r\nand, with as much kindness as difficulty, the stranger succeeded in\r\ntaking the disabled _Amoor_ in tow, and bringing her into port in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMelbourne.--The Squatters.--The Two Convicts.--A Painful\r\nSeparation.--The _Golden Fairy_.--Ruth's Misfortunes.--A Nocturnal\r\nAlarm.--Ruth's Confession.--The Ship on Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeary, distressed, and suffering, the passengers on the _Amoor_ gladly\r\nlanded on the busy wharf, and were conveyed to Melbourne, where Mr.\r\nMayburn and his daughter, Mrs. Deverell and Emma, were settled in a\r\nhandsome hotel; but Mr. Deverell and his people, with the young\r\nMayburns, remained at the port to land the cargo and inspect the damage\r\ndone by the storm. It was soon ascertained that the loss must be\r\nconsiderable--a number of sheep and cattle, besides a valuable horse,\r\nhad been swept into the sea; and all that had been saved were in bad\r\ncondition; but it was to be hoped a short rest at Melbourne might\r\nrestore these, and fit them for their long journey into the interior.\r\nThen Deverell had to search for experienced drovers to guide and assist\r\nhis own men; and finally, he undertook to inquire for the first vessel\r\nto Calcutta that could accommodate Mr. Mayburn and his family, as some\r\nmonths must elapse before the disabled _Amoor_ could be prepared to\r\nresume the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe girls looked out from the windows of the hotel with admiration at\r\nthe broad and peopled streets, the handsome churches, and the European\r\naspect of a town on the spot which, but a few years before, had been a\r\nlonely wilderness; but the pious Mr. Mayburn called them away to unite\r\nwith him in thanksgiving for this their first experience of the progress\r\nof divine and social knowledge, even into the farthest regions of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"The spirit which has clothed the desert with the blessings of peace and\r\nabundance,\" said he, \"and has planted the gospel of life in a\r\nnewly-discovered world, will by God's blessing spread onwards like a\r\nfertilizing river till the word of the Lord be accomplished; for the\r\nblessed day draweth nigh when the scattered people of God shall be\r\ngathered into one fold, and the great shepherd shall say, 'Well done.'\"\r\n\r\n\"God speed the day, dear papa,\" said Margaret. \"But we must not be mere\r\nwatchers; we must all be workers. Wherever we go, we shall find an\r\nuntilled field, and we must all put our shoulders to the plough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, my child,\" replied he, with a sigh; for though ever\r\nwilling to fulfil the duty lying before him, Mr. Mayburn wanted\r\nresolution to seek out the hard work of the fervent missionary of\r\nChristianity. Evening brought to them the fatigued young men with\r\nsatisfactory news. A vessel, the _Golden Fairy_, which had landed a\r\nparty of gold-diggers from England, was going forward to Calcutta with\r\nsheep and merchandise. The captain, very glad to obtain passengers,\r\nreadily agreed to accommodate Mr. Mayburn's family; he was to sail in\r\nthree days, so no time must be lost in making preparations.\r\n\r\n\"As to my own affairs,\" added Edward Deverell, \"I have succeeded in\r\nfinding quarters for all my live-stock. The cattle, horses, pigs, and\r\nsheep were certainly somewhat unruly; but the women and children ten\r\ntimes more troublesome. Such an amount of bundles, bags, baskets,\r\ncradles, and cats as they have brought! How we have housed them all is a\r\nmiracle; and how we are to get them up the country is a puzzling\r\nproblem. Finally, I have bought a train of wagons, and engaged two\r\ngentlemen as guides, who are her majesty's prisoners, released on\r\n_parole_; in fact, two ticket-of-leave convicts.\"\r\n\r\nA scream from Emma, and a groan from her mother, followed this\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\"Surely you have not been so rash, Edward,\" said Mrs. Deverell. \"Let us\r\nmake our way rather with our own people only. Consider the contamination\r\nof such society for our poor virtuous followers. Besides, it is but too\r\nprobable we may be robbed and murdered by such wretches.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an inevitable evil, mother,\" answered Edward, \"for we cannot\r\nattempt the journey without guidance. These men have behaved well since\r\ntheir transportation; they are brothers--poachers--who, like many in\r\ntheir situation, have erred rather through ignorance and weakness than\r\ndepravity. At least, such is the report of the overlooker who\r\nrecommended them. They have been out before in the interior with\r\nsquatters, and know the valleys of the Murray and the Darling, beyond\r\nwhich our ultra-frontier tract is spread. I have been to the Colonial\r\nOffice, and have obtained the necessary forms for taking possession of\r\nfifty thousand acres of _waste land_, as it is called, for a long lease\r\nof years. And now, mother, we are, according to the legalized and\r\nelegant form, _squatters_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Colonists_, my son; I cannot bear the strange, uncouth word\r\n_squatters_,\" said Mrs. Deverell.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, mamma,\" said Edward, laughing, \"it is official language.\r\nWe may call ourselves, if we choose, landed gentry; but the world of\r\nAustralia will rank us only as part of the _squattocracy_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I a squatter?\" asked little Emma, in dismay; and great was the mirth\r\nof her favorite friends, Hugh and Gerald, when Emma was pronounced to be\r\nlegally a squatter.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the two convict guides were admitted to receive their\r\nfinal directions from Mr. Deverell, and were regarded with some\r\nuneasiness and much curiosity. One was a rough country lad, dressed in a\r\nfustian suit and a fur cap, rude in manner, but of pleasing, open\r\ncountenance: the other, who was older, had a shabby-genteel appearance;\r\nhe had discarded his convict's habit, and had expended the earnest-money\r\nreceived from Mr. Deverell in an old suit of black clothes, and a very\r\nbad English hat, which he had placed on his head in a jaunty style.\r\n\r\n\"Please to show me your district by map, sir,\" said he, bowing at the\r\nsame time in a very conceited manner to the ladies. \"You must look to\r\nme, _cartee blank_, sir; for you see, sir, my brother is not\r\nintelligible; he has not had the blessing of eddication.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your education, my friend,\" said Edward Deverell, \"has not been a\r\nblessing to you, I fear. Have you not rather turned it to evil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite the _contrairy_, sir,\" said the man. \"I look forrard to its\r\nhelping me up-hill in this free country. Why, sir, a man born anunder an\r\nhedge may top over quality and ride in his carriage here, if he can only\r\ncome round his parts of speech rightly. But Davy will stick where he is,\r\nfor he never could tell an X from an _anpassy_.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all true,\" said the rough rustic, \"I'se no scholar like Bill,\r\nmaster, but I'se do my best for ye, and glad to get out from amang yon\r\nrogues. It's hard for a lad to be sorted with such company for just\r\nsniggling a hare.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ensnaring_, David,\" said his brother, pompously; \"_sniggling_ is\r\ncolloquial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sniggling, you know, Bill,\" answered David, \"our lads call it in t'\r\nnorth country; and little harm is there in't I say, that they should\r\nsend a poor lad amang thieves and cut-throats. But, please God, I'se out\r\nof their way, and it will be mony a day afore I come nigh them again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem a simple, though ignorant youth,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"and I\r\ncannot understand how it happened you were so severely punished for\r\npoaching; though doubtless it is an offence against the law.\"\r\n\r\nBill laughed contemptuously as he replied for his brother,--\"You see,\r\nsir, Davy was always a fool, or we need not both have been expostulated\r\nto this place. Our master always called him David Simple, and sure\r\nenough, if it had not been for his downright idiosyncrasy, we might have\r\ngot clear off; but nothing would serve him but to show fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, just be quiet, Bill, man,\" said David; \"it was for thee I stood\r\nout. You'se hear all, master; I'se tell t' truth. Bill had his gun, and\r\nbrought down a few birds, and I were knocking a few rabbits over, and it\r\nchanced to be a moonshiny night, when out pops a keeper, and fells Bill\r\ndown with a club; and I heard him shout out to me, as how his arm was\r\nbroken. That aggravated me bitter, and up I ran, and leathered t' fellow\r\nwell with my stick. Then Bill got up and ran off, but I was fain to\r\nstop, and give t' keeper a hiding; but he roared out so loud that two\r\nmore chaps came up, and first took me, and then went off after Bill.\r\nWhen they got to our lodging, he made as how he knew nought about it,\r\nbut they found birds and his gun underneath t' bed; and there was his\r\narm all black and blue, but not broken, as he said. So off they carried\r\nus to prison, and Bill wanted me to say as how he that were with me were\r\nJack Kay, an auld poacher; but I couldn't swear away a man's\r\n_charackter_, and t' keeper took his oath Bill wanted to shut him, and I\r\nwere no better; so they sent us both over t' water. It's a thousand\r\npities for Bill, for he's a scholar, cute as he is about sniggling.\"\r\n\r\nDavid was the favorite of the family, who did not admire the flowery\r\nlanguage and cunning look of _cute_ Bill; but among a horde of lawless\r\nmen, Edward Deverell congratulated himself that he had been fortunate\r\nenough to obtain two men less depraved than might have been expected.\r\n\r\nIt was with a sinking heart, oppressed with strange forebodings, that\r\nMargaret looked on the large, dark, dirty and gloomy ship honored by the\r\ninappropriate name of the _Golden Fairy_. She grieved for the separation\r\nfrom the new friends that the whole family had learned to love so well,\r\nand she shrunk from the prospect of unknown difficulties and dangers,\r\nwhen all decision and responsibility would be thrown upon her, from the\r\nhelpless character of her beloved but irresolute parent. During the\r\nfirst voyage, the powerful and energetic character of Edward Deverell\r\nhad swayed the judgment of Mr. Mayburn; but in future, Margaret felt she\r\ncould only look to her young brother Arthur for aid.\r\n\r\n\"Yet have I not a greater aid?\" she repeated to herself. \"Forgive me, my\r\nheavenly Father! Thou art my friend and my counsellor! Let me ever turn\r\nto Thee in my trials, and I must be in safety.\" And thus, with a heart\r\never recognizing the presence and relying on the love of a watchful God,\r\nMargaret Mayburn walked on her way steadily and fearlessly.\r\n\r\nThe parting of the two families was very painful, yet they cheered\r\nthemselves with the hope so unquenchable in the young. They talked\r\nconfidently of their future meeting, the boys traced over and over again\r\non the map the route they proposed to take to Daisy Grange; and, but for\r\nMargaret's firmness, even Mr. Mayburn, at the last moment, would have\r\nrelinquished his hopes of spreading the gospel in the East, to follow\r\nthe new colonists into the dreary untrodden deserts.\r\n\r\nThere was an appearance of neglect and disorder in the _Golden Fairy_\r\nthat was repugnant to the taste of the Mayburns, after being accustomed\r\nto the trim, orderly arrangements of the _Amoor_; Edward Deverell\r\npointed out to Captain Markham several necessary changes which must be\r\nmade for the comfort of passengers who paid him so handsomely, and was\r\nannoyed to perceive that his suggestions were received slightingly and\r\nalmost contemptuously. He himself procured more conveniences for the\r\ncabin of his friends, and he besought Margaret and Arthur to be firm and\r\ndetermined with Markham, who seemed careless, and, he suspected,\r\naddicted to drinking. Now, when too late, he regretted that he had not\r\ninduced the family to remain at Melbourne for the sailing of the mail\r\npacket; but Arthur had been anxious for his father to hasten to his\r\nmission, lest his vacillating nature should lead him to relinquish it.\r\nBesides which, the throng of gold-diggers made the cost of living at\r\nMelbourne a serious consideration.\r\n\r\nFinally, with tears and sorrowful hearts, the friends took leave of each\r\nother, with the remote chance that favorable circumstances might bring\r\nthem together again; and it was not till the fair sunny shores of\r\nAustralia had faded from their sight, that the voyagers retired to their\r\ncabin to endeavor to resign themselves to their changed circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe want of order in their new home was particularly trying to the\r\nscarcely-reclaimed Ruth. She had learned to be useful among the emigrant\r\nwomen in the neatly-ordered _Amoor_; but she soon relapsed into her\r\nusual heedless habits, amidst the scattered packages and general\r\nconfusion in the _Golden Fairy_. She stumbled over boxes which were not\r\nstowed in their proper places, she was thrown down by some terrified\r\nsheep that had escaped from its pen, she trod to death some rambling\r\nchicken that had found its way into the cabins, or she destroyed the\r\ncups and plates by officiously spreading the table in the midst of a\r\ngale, though she had been warned of the consequences.\r\n\r\n\"Margaret,\" said Mr. Mayburn, who had been uneasily watching the girl's\r\nunlucky movements, \"I am of opinion that poor Ruth should be subjected\r\nto some restraint I observe that the inevitable result of her\r\nundertakings is destruction. She is a curious study; nor can I solve the\r\nmystery why she should always do wrong when she designs to do right I am\r\nalarmed, Margaret; I eat my food in terror, lest she should have poured\r\nlaudanum into the curry, or scattered arsenic over the pudding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have no fear, papa,\" answered Margaret. \"Ruth is never intrusted with\r\nculinary preparations: the cook is too cross to allow her to touch any\r\nof his dishes, nor has she the means of procuring any of those dreaded\r\npoisons. I do not fear that she will harm any one but herself with her\r\nheedlessness; but, poor girl, she is covered with bruises and cuts from\r\nfalls. Nor is she entirely to blame, for the cabins are filled up with\r\npackages which Arthur says ought to be stowed in the hold. We must,\r\nhowever, make up our minds to be inconvenienced for the short time I\r\ntrust we shall be shut up in this prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I could do, my child,\" answered he; \"but I fear Markham is not a\r\nman of understanding to depend on in emergency. This is a sea of perils,\r\nof storms and pirates. What would become of us if any of these dangers\r\nassailed us? Arthur, you look disturbed; you think with me, that Markham\r\nis unfit for his situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly, papa, I have some doubts of him,\" replied Arthur. \"I think he\r\nmust be an experienced sailor, for he has made this voyage many times;\r\nand I should not have lost confidence in him, if I had not actually seen\r\nhim intoxicated. And I fear he is utterly unprincipled, for he wanted us\r\nto join him in his nightly revels. Now, Margaret, if a storm should come\r\non in the night, I feel assured that he would be incapable of giving\r\norders.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a pretty set of queer-looking boys he has fished up at Melbourne,\"\r\nsaid Gerald, \"to man the ugly ship. Hugh and I have marked our men, and\r\nhaven't they _rogue_ written on their black brows!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Gerald, is it not somewhat unkind to form so hasty a judgment?\"\r\nsaid Margaret. \"These sailors are strangers; why do you class them as\r\nrogues?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, Meggie,\" said Hugh, \"Gerald saw with his own eyes a lot of\r\nfellows in their yellow convict dress brought up for Markham to choose a\r\ncrew from, for all his own men had deserted to go to the diggings. And\r\nwe both agree that he must have picked out the most villanous-looking of\r\nthe lot. Now, just come up with us, Meggie, and take a look at the\r\nfellows, and you shall hear what Jack says.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret went on deck with her brothers, to walk round the disorderly\r\nplace; and, under the pretext of examining the various parts of the\r\nship, she carefully marked the faces of the men she encountered, and\r\ncould not deny that they were not only coarse and bold, but that most of\r\nthem had the fierce, sinister, lowering expression which usually\r\ndistinguishes the convict. She stopped to speak to Jack, who was busily\r\nengaged finishing a model he had begun at Melbourne, of one of the\r\nlight-hung, commodious, broad-wheeled travelling wagons Mr. Deverell had\r\nbought at that place.\r\n\r\n\"I could easily make one for you, Miss Margaret,\" said Jack, \"if it were\r\nneeded; but they tell me you'll want no wheeled-carriages yonder. More's\r\nthe pity. I wish master had been persuaded to stay with Mr. Deverell. I\r\ndon't half like this, for, oh! Miss Margaret,\" added he, looking around,\r\n\"we've got among a bad lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have we to fear, Jack?\" asked she, pale with fear.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be down-hearted, miss,\" said the lad; \"but I doubt we may have\r\nawkward work; for when Captain Markham is in his cups, everybody's\r\nmaster. But please God to send us fair winds, we shall soon get through\r\nthe voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must pray for His help, Jack,\" said Margaret; \"and let us avoid\r\nthese men as much as possible. You, Jack, as well as my brothers, must\r\nremain below; better endure confinement than encounter wickedness.\"\r\n\r\n\"And please, Miss Margaret,\" continued Jack, \"would you ask Mrs. Wilson\r\nto mind and keep Ruth close; for these saucy fellows amuse themselves\r\nwith sending her on some foolish errand, and getting her into mischief.\r\nI near had a fight with that big brute, the mate, for pitching her over\r\na hencoop; but Wilkins, that little sharp fellow at the masthead, got me\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret and Arthur had many long and serious conversations on their\r\nuncomfortable position, particularly when their voyage was retarded by\r\nthe contrary winds of that uncertain sea. Then the family secluded\r\nthemselves in the two crowded cabins appropriated to their use, and\r\nendeavored, by prayer and regulation of the mind, to prepare themselves\r\nfor the dangers into which such an ill-ruled vessel might be hurried.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of great vexation, occasioned by the carelessness of Ruth,\r\nwho had, by some mischievous device of the sailors, let all the poultry\r\nloose, and had been compelled by the violent captain to hunt them up\r\nfrom every corner of the vessel, the girl had been summoned before\r\nMargaret and Jenny, to be rebuked for her thoughtless conduct. She wept,\r\nand promised to improve, and was sent to her berth, Nurse declaring that\r\nshe had made up her mind never to lose sight of her all the next day.\r\nThen, after meeting for prayers in Mr. Mayburn's cabin, they returned,\r\nto seek such repose as their close, uncomfortable berths afforded.\r\n\r\nIt might have been two or three hours after this, when Margaret awoke\r\nwith a strange feeling of oppression and fear, which she vainly\r\nattempted to shake off. At length, she called out from her berth,\r\n\"Nurse, are you awake? Will you go on deck with me for a few minutes? I\r\nlong for the refreshment of the night air, for the cabin is more\r\nsuffocating than usual to-night. Surely a storm must be at hand, for the\r\nair is positively scorching.\"\r\n\r\nJenny yawned and murmured, till at length, becoming aware of the request\r\nof her young mistress, she scrambled from her awkward berth; but no\r\nsooner was she on her feet, than, thoroughly awakened, she exclaimed,\r\n\"God have mercy on us! for there must be something on fire. I smell and\r\nfeel it must be so!\"\r\n\r\nMargaret sprang up, trembling in every limb, but firm in heart, to rush\r\nthrough the door that separated the cabins, and arouse her father and\r\nbrothers. Jenny, in the mean time, opened the outer door, and then the\r\nsmell of burning wood was plainly perceptible. While Mr. Mayburn and his\r\nsons hastily got ready, Margaret proceeded to the cabin of Capt.\r\nMarkham, and knocked loudly in her fright, crying out almost\r\nunconsciously as she knocked, \"Fire! fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who calls fire?\" cried Markham, with a bitter oath. \"Who dares to say\r\nthat?\" and his head appeared from the cabin door. His voice was husky\r\nand broken, and Margaret feared he was intoxicated and might not\r\ncomprehend her, as she rapidly narrated her observations and her fears.\r\nDeep and horrible were the curses of the wicked man, as he staggered\r\nforward, screaming and yelling for the watch. That there was any watch\r\nin this disorderly establishment, Margaret doubted. She hurried back to\r\nher father; and they were soon alarmed by the sounds of dreadful curses,\r\nthe trampling of many feet, the ringing of bells, and the cries of the\r\ndisturbed and terrified sheep. Arthur and Hugh were sent up to ascertain\r\nthe fact of danger, and they found the lazy crew effectually roused to\r\naction; lanterns were flying about in different directions; and at\r\nlength the fatal cry was heard, \"Fire in the after-hold!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nInsubordination of the Sailors.--Rapid Progress of the Fire.--The Boats\r\nlowered.--Ruth's Prize.--A Man saved.--Black Peter.--The Adventure of a\r\nReprobate Crew.--A Dangerous Comrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the harsh voice of Markham was heard pouring out orders, loud, but\r\nalmost inarticulate with rage and drunkenness; while, regardless of his\r\nawful situation, with fearful blasphemy he imprecated curses on the\r\nnegligence which had caused the accident, and on the tardiness of action\r\namong his insubordinate crew. At length the fire-engine was got to work;\r\nlengths of leather hose were stretched down to the burning hold; buckets\r\nwere rapidly passed from hand to hand; and the splashing of water was\r\nfollowed by the hissing of the flames.\r\n\r\nThe four young men joined the sailors and worked manfully at the engine\r\nor with buckets, while Mr. Mayburn, alternately trembling, weeping, and\r\ndespairing, and then, in earnest prayer, regaining his firmness and\r\nresignation, occupied the care and attention of Margaret almost\r\nentirely. Jenny, with practical good sense, was collecting the most\r\nvaluable part of their property.\r\n\r\n\"If we be not burnt to death first, Miss Marget,\" she said; \"Jack tells\r\nme we shall be took off in boats, God help us! so it's time to be making\r\nready. Come, lass!\" to Ruth, \"and tie this bag. What ails ye, you\r\nsimpleton? What are you staring round in that fashion for?\"\r\n\r\nRuth was gazing about with a wild expression of terror in her eyes, and,\r\nunmindful of the injunctions of Mrs. Wilson, she suddenly threw down the\r\nbag, and fell on her knees before Mr. Mayburn, crying out, \"Ah, master,\r\nwill they hang me? I didn't think it would burn us all alive! I couldn't\r\nfind it again, try all I would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunate girl,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"have you lost your senses, or\r\nwhat have you done? Speak the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell truth, master,\" sobbed the girl. \"It was when I were lating\r\nup them bonnie chickens as had got out, and big Peter tied a rope across\r\nin yon passage for me to tummel ower, and I rolled down t' ladder into\r\nthat big, dark place where they keep great bales and barrels, and all\r\nmanners of things; my lantern was broken and my candle was lost. I got\r\nmysel' gathered up, and I groped about for t' candle, but I couldn't\r\nfind it, and I got sadly flayed in that dark hole, so I climbed up and\r\nsaid nought to nobody; but, oh, master, I couldn't get to sleep, for it\r\ncame into my head, may be my candle might have set some of them bundles\r\nin a low, and we might all be burned in our beds, and me not saying a\r\nword alike, for fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"God forgive you, Ruth,\" said her master. \"Pray for mercy; and if it\r\nplease Him to save us in this fearful hour of peril, never forget the\r\nmisery and destruction your carelessness has caused.\"\r\n\r\nThe penitent and affrighted girl shook in every limb, and Margaret\r\nkindly soothed and prayed with her till she calmed her agitation. Then\r\nthe young and thoughtful daughter said,--\r\n\r\n\"Papa, we must not remain inclosed in this suffocating cabin. Let us go\r\non deck, and if no other hope remains, we will demand a boat, that we\r\nmay escape from a horrible death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lead the way, my child,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"and I will follow you, as I\r\never do; for I feel utterly helpless alone.\"\r\n\r\nThey proceeded to the deck, followed by Jenny and Ruth loaded with\r\npackages; and when they reached the scene of terror and confusion, they\r\nwere embarrassed among piles of boxes, barrels, and bales, which were\r\ncontinually drawn up from below, the bales which were blazing being\r\nimmediately thrown overboard.\r\n\r\nBy the light of the torches, Margaret discovered among the throng her\r\nyoung brothers, busily employed in hauling ropes and carrying buckets;\r\nthey were heated with exertion and blackened with smoke. O'Brien had\r\neven got his hair singed with the flames. Still untired, they would have\r\ncontinued their efforts, but all seemed ineffectual, from the total want\r\nof subordination and unanimity among the sailors. Mr. Mayburn walked up\r\nto Captain Markham, who stood aloof from the rest, in a perfect state of\r\nfrenzy, from fear, anger, and intoxication. He continued to shout aloud\r\ncontradictory and absurd orders, which were utterly unheeded by the\r\nlawless crew; each man doing what he chose, and nothing being done\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\n\"The fire is certainly progressing, Captain Markham,\" said Mr. Mayburn.\r\n\"Let me entreat you to issue orders for some means of providing for the\r\nsafety of so many human beings all unfit for death. We, who are your\r\npassengers, demand the means of escape.\"\r\n\r\nWith a fearful oath, the wretch said his passengers might care for\r\nthemselves; he had enough to do to save his ship; and save it he would,\r\nif it cost him half the crew.\r\n\r\n\"I'll pitch the dogs into the fire,\" said he, \"if they do not soon\r\nextinguish it; and not a man shall leave the _Golden Fairy_ living.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's not many will do that,\" cried the audacious mate, \"if they do\r\nnot look sharp. The fire has just reached the tallow hogsheads, man, and\r\nwhere will your ship be then? Come along, lads, we can do no more; so\r\nlet every fellow lay his hands on what he likes best, and lower the\r\nboats now or never.\"\r\n\r\nThe call was readily responded to, in spite of the threats of the\r\ninfuriated captain; and though the flames were now heard roaring below,\r\nand were even visible in some parts, the after-deck was still uninjured;\r\nand from thence the boats were lowered. Arthur and Jack went up to the\r\nmen to request that a boat, or at all events seats in one of the boats,\r\nmight be given to their party, who would be willing to reward the men\r\nfor any trouble they occasioned. The insolent mate, who seemed to have\r\nassumed the command of the rest, laughed at the request.\r\n\r\n\"Charity begins at home!\" cried he. \"We have no places to spare. Come\r\non, my lads! lower the biscuit and the brandy casks. I'll manage the\r\nstrong box. Out of my way, gentry. If you say another word we'll pitch\r\nyou all into the sea--men and women.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no hope of our getting a boat to ourselves, Mr. Arthur,\" said\r\nJack, \"for they 're all afloat now, and they'll soon have them off; so I\r\nwould say, if you'd help a bit, we should set about getting up a raft as\r\nfast as we can--here are plenty of spare spars about.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Markham saw the men preparing to forsake the vessel, he became more\r\nfurious than ever, and seizing the mate by the collar, he swore he would\r\nhave him put in irons. But his attempts were useless against the\r\npowerful villain, who flung him on one side like a noxious reptile; and\r\nthe rest of the remorseless wretches, to rid themselves at once of the\r\nopposition of the violent drunkard, hurled him down into the flames,\r\nwhich were already bursting through the crevices of the deck.\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand that,\" cried Wilkins, one of the sailors, coming up to\r\nJack; \"I'se not the chap to turn my back on my comrades; but I've never\r\ncommitted wilful murder, and I'll just cut away from a gang of such\r\ndeep-dyed rogues, and join ye, my honest fellow. Come, I'se ready to\r\nlend a hand.\"\r\n\r\nA helping hand was truly desirable in their extremity of distress; but\r\nMr. Mayburn shrank from the fierce, rough aspect of the convict sailor,\r\nand besought Arthur, in a low tone, to reject any association with crime\r\nand infamy.\r\n\r\n\"Be satisfied, my dear father,\" answered he, \"I will do nothing\r\nunadvisedly; but if this man shrinks from evil and turns to good, how\r\nshall we excuse ourselves if we force him back to destruction? Besides,\r\nit is now too late; see, the first boat has already deserted the ship.\"\r\n\r\nWith loud cheers, the most daring of the crew headed by the mate, rowed\r\noff in the long boat, and were soon lost in the darkness that shrouded\r\nall except the fearful space around the burning ship. The second boat\r\nfollowed, the hardened men turning a deaf ear to the entreaties of the\r\npassengers whom they had abandoned on the wreck. They refused even to\r\naid them in lowering their hastily-constructed and unsafe raft, but\r\nlaughed and sneered at the rude workmanship.\r\n\r\nBut the flames, fed by the hogsheads of tallow in the hold, now blazed\r\nup through the cabin windows, and bursting through the decks, ran along\r\nwith fatal rapidity, momentarily threatening the distressed family with\r\na dreadful fate. It was now that the cool prudence and skill of their\r\nfaithful friend Jack rescued them. His observing eye had noted the means\r\nadopted by the sailors; he had tools and appliances; he arranged and\r\ndivided the labor, of which even the women had their share; and the rude\r\nraft was at length successfully lowered. A few necessaries were hastily\r\nthrown upon it, including a cask of biscuit and one of water, which\r\nWilkins at great hazard had obtained; he had also brought up a small\r\nbarrel of rum, but Arthur peremptorily refused to take it, and, to end\r\nall discussion, flung it into the sea, and firmly told Wilkins, he would\r\nrather leave him to perish on the burning ship, than carry him away with\r\nsuch a temptation to evil.\r\n\r\nThe man grumbled unavailingly, but at last returned to his duty. Nothing\r\nmore could be secured, except a few ropes, and spars, with some tools to\r\nrepair the raft. Then a spare sail was cast over the stowage, and, one\r\nafter another, Mr. Mayburn and the trembling women were let down; the\r\nactive boys quickly followed. Jack and Wilkins were the last to descend\r\nfrom their perilous position, where they had been so surrounded by the\r\nflames, now crawling up the masts, that Margaret dreaded every moment\r\nthey should fall victims; but they happily alighted on the lumbering\r\nraft in safety. Then oars were taken up, and no time was lost in\r\npushing off as far as possible from the ill-fated _Golden Fairy_; nor\r\ndid they pause even to look round till they were at a safe distance,\r\nwhen they stood off for a few minutes to contemplate the splendid and\r\nfrightful spectacle.\r\n\r\nWilkins now confessed to them that there were some barrels of gunpowder\r\nconcealed in the vessel, which the reckless sailors had smuggled from\r\nMelbourne for their own purposes; for it had been their fixed intention,\r\nat a favorable opportunity, to murder the captain and passengers, or\r\nland them on some desert island; and to take possession of the ship for\r\npiratical enterprises in the Indian Ocean. The knowledge that this\r\npowder was in the ship had hastened their flight from the certain\r\nconsequences, and Wilkins was surprised that the catastrophe had been so\r\nlong averted. But now, as they watched the blackened ribs of the vessel,\r\nthrough which the intense flame glowed, while clouds of smoke, myriads\r\nof sparks, and burning flakes, rose from the wreck, a loud explosion\r\nalmost deafened them; another and another succeeded; then blazed up a\r\nmass of flame, which seemed to rise to the very clouds for a few\r\nminutes, followed by utter darkness and silence.\r\n\r\n\"May God, in his infinite mercy, still preserve the weak creatures he\r\nhas so miraculously delivered,\" said Mr. Mayburn, devoutly. \"We were\r\nface to face with death, and never, my children, can the crackling,\r\nroaring sound of that fierce and unconquerable conflagration fade from\r\nmy recollection. We had not the consolation of the martyrs who suffered\r\nfor the faith, and who could look on the flames as the brief path to\r\neternal glory. We were summoned in the midst of life's cares and\r\nfrailties, unwillingly, fearfully, to be dragged to doom; and He spared\r\nus, that we might better prepare to appear before His tribunal. Blessed\r\nforever be His holy name!\"\r\n\r\nSolemnly and earnestly rose the Amen from the rescued. Even the hardened\r\nconvict lowered his voice as he said, with levity, to Jack, \"That was a\r\ncanny bit prayer; will 'it help us ony, think ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Wilkins,\" said Jack, \"I do believe that God never fails to help\r\nthem who pray to Him. And some day, my man, you will be glad to believe\r\nit too.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins said no more, but he often remembered the new, strange words he\r\nhad heard poured out amidst that horror of darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Captain Arthur,\" cried out Hugh, \"please to say where we are, and\r\nwhither we are to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could determine where we are,\" answered Arthur; \"but we have\r\nbeen so tossed about for the last two days, that I have no idea of our\r\nposition. Certainly we are out of our regular course.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Bully Dan were right,\" said Wilkins, \"we ought to be now a good bit\r\nnorth of Swan River, and among islands and reefs puzzling enough at\r\nnoonday; and in this black darkness it's odd that we ever see land\r\nagain. If any on ye had thought of an anchor, we might have laid off\r\ntill day.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing but patience and resignation for the voyagers. The sea\r\nwas less agitated than it had been during the day, and they drifted\r\nsteadily over the waves; but in what direction they could not determine;\r\nfor such was the confusion of their embarkation, and such the darkness\r\nthat enveloped them, that no one could pronounce from what point the\r\nwind was blowing.\r\n\r\n\"What is that fluttering sound I hear?\" asked Mr. Mayburn, in a voice of\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nA moment's silence followed, then every one distinctly heard the\r\nfluttering. At length Ruth said, \"Oh! if you please, master, it was only\r\nme. I couldn't bide that they should be burned alive, bonnie things; it\r\nwere not their fault! It's them bits of chickens as I were hunting up\r\nwhen all this bad work were done--God forgive me!--and I gathered them\r\ninto a basket; and if ye please, Miss Marget, dinnot let them be eaten,\r\nthey're so bonnie.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret readily granted the noisy little prisoners their life, and\r\napplauded the humanity of Ruth, whose struggles to keep her restless\r\ncharge in order created some mirth, and diverted them for a time from\r\nthe contemplation of their own troubles.\r\n\r\nBut another sound was now heard above the monotonous rumbling of the\r\nunquiet ocean. It was surely, they thought, a human cry! It was again\r\nrepeated; and Wilkins said very coolly, \"It'll be some of our chaps.\r\nLike enough they'll have capsized yon big crazy boat. They'd a keg of\r\nbrandy to fight about; and I'll be bound they'd never settle as long as\r\nthere were a drop left in't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we not show them a light?\" said Mr. Mayburn: \"that was a cry of\r\ndistress, and humanity calls on us to aid them.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no room here for any more hands,\" muttered Wilkins. \"Drunken\r\nrogues! they'd kick these few shaking clogs to bits in no time: and then\r\nwhere are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, Margaret, we must do our duty. Arthur, what do you say?\"\r\nasked Mr. Mayburn anxiously.\r\n\r\nA loud and dismal scream, at no great distance, decided the question\r\nwithout further discussion. Gerald produced a match-box; and though the\r\nwind had got up rather boisterously, they succeeded in lighting and\r\ndisplaying a long splinter of wood. Then a voice was heard to cry,\r\n\"Help! help!\" and Wilkins, with a suppressed curse, said, \"It's that\r\ndesp'rate rogue, Black Peter, and no mistake. Better let him drown, I\r\ntell ye, comrades; but I've heared 'em say, water won't haud him.\r\nThey're all alike bad dogs to let loose among us; they've guns and\r\npowder, and they're up to ony sort of bloody work.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn groaned at this speech, and said, \"What shall we do,\r\nArthur?--we are wholly defenceless against those bad men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think of that, sir,\" said O'Brien; \"Hugh and I looked after\r\nthat. We brought off a pair of first-rate rifles, with lots of powder\r\nand shot. We are the boys to manage the defences. We left the nautical\r\nmatters to our captain, Arthur; Jack sought up the spars and hammers,\r\nand such matters; and Margaret did the commissariat. Division of labor,\r\nyou see, sir--all regular.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not think your giddy brain could have arranged so well,\" said Mr.\r\nMayburn: \"I am ashamed to say I have not been so thoughtful.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, papa,\" said Hugh; \"Gerald is taking more credit than is due to\r\nus. It was Margaret who arranged what each should do, and allowed us to\r\nadd to our duties as we chose; in consequence of which, you see, Gerald\r\nand I thought of destroying life, and Ruth of preserving it.\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus talking, the young rowers had been endeavoring laboriously to\r\nforce the heavy raft, against the wind, towards the spot from whence the\r\ncries seemed to proceed. The darkness was so intense that it was in vain\r\nthe eye sought to penetrate it; but the cry, still heard at intervals,\r\nseemed to approach nearer, probably directed by the light. Still it was\r\nnot without an involuntary shudder, and a half-uttered shriek, that they\r\nfelt and saw a hand grasp the raft, and heard a hoarse voice demand\r\nhelp. This was immediately given; Arthur and Jack, with much difficulty,\r\ndrew upon the raft the almost lifeless form of a tall, powerful man, who\r\nlay gasping many minutes before he was able to reply to the anxious\r\ninquiries of his preservers if any of his companions yet survived.\r\n\r\n\"Every rogue among 'em gone to his reckoning,\" said he, with a\r\ndiabolical laugh. \"A good riddance! If we'd only saved the gold and the\r\nbrandy! But hand me a sup of something, good folks.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have nothing but water,\" said Arthur gravely.\r\n\r\nThe man made a wry face, and said, \"I've had more nor enough of that.\r\nWell, then, what are ye bound after in this queer craft? It'll not stand\r\nmuch weather, I take it. And,\" with an oath, \"Wilkins, man, how came you\r\nto drop in among these saints?\"\r\n\r\nWilkins gave the man a fiery glance, as he answered, \"It were a bit\r\nsafer to-night among saints nor amang sinners, it's like; and I guess ye\r\nwere thinking so a bit sin' yersel'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never heed that that's gone, man,\" said the careless villain: \"I'm in\r\nas good a place as they are now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Peter,\" said Wilkins, \"it's all true as how neither fire nor water\r\nwill touch thee. We'se see what thou was born to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep a civil tongue in thy head,\" replied Peter, \"for thou and me must\r\nchum together, and see what we can pick up.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the cause of your accident, unhappy man?\" said Mr. Mayburn,\r\ncoming up to him.\r\n\r\n\"None so unhappy now,\" answered the surly fellow; \"better off nor I have\r\nbeen for a few years past, if it were not for want of brandy. I'se free\r\nand idle, and can have plenty of grub, I reckon,\" looking at the casks;\r\n\"so I'se do now. We might have kept together; but, ye see, we began ower\r\nsoon with our brandy, and had only one drinking-cup among us, and\r\neverybody wanted it first; and so we chaps got to words, and then to\r\nhard hits, and then out came our knives. We were badly crowded; and,\r\nsomehow, in our scrimmage, we all fell atop of one another, and capsized\r\nour boat, and away we all went down. Then, when we came up, such cursing\r\nand yelling never was heard on earth or sea, and, dark as it was, none\r\ncould catch hold on aught to save him. It was soon settled, however; for\r\nall our chaps were over far gone in drink to help themselves, and they\r\nwent down, shouting out, one after another. I had the luck to catch hold\r\nof the brandy-keg, and I took care to keep hold; but I could not stop it\r\nfrom leaking, and it vexed me sore that so much good liquor should be\r\nmade into salt-water grog, and no time to get a sup. I shouted as loud\r\nas I could, and let myself float, till I got sight of your signal, and\r\nthen I thought there was a bit of a chance; so I managed to swim a few\r\nstrokes, keeping one hand on my barrel; but I made little way, if the\r\nsea and the wind hadn't brought me right up to you. When my barrel\r\nbumped again the raft, I lost hold, and I hardly know how it was I\r\nclutched the spars; but here I be snug and safe in harbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for your preservation, reckless man,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"He,\r\nwho is all mercy to His sinful creatures, has granted you a respite,\r\nthat you may learn to know and serve Him. Cast not away the precious\r\nboon, but in this awful hour, turn to Him, repent, and pray.\"\r\n\r\nThe good man kneeled down beside the reprobate, and offered up an\r\nearnest prayer for the wretched sinner, who was sound asleep before Mr.\r\nMayburn had concluded; and it was with a sigh he turned from the man,\r\nsorrowful, but not hopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAfloat on an Unknown Sea.--The insubordinate Sailor.--The Coral\r\nReefs.--An Island in view.--The Perilous Landing.--Peter's\r\nRebellion.--The First Night on Shore.--Ruth among the Crockery.--A\r\nvaluable Prize.--The March from the First Encampment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the morning light dawned on the distressed voyagers, they became\r\naware of their perilous situation. Around them lay the wide restless\r\nocean, now agitated by a south-west wind, which drove them onward,\r\nwashed and drenched by the waves, which threatened destruction to their\r\nfrail vessel, in the midst of which the little knot of united friends\r\nwere now gathered, their unwelcome guest still lying asleep apart from\r\nthem. As soon as the light permitted him, Jack began steadily and\r\ncarefully to repair and strengthen the raft. The spare spars he now\r\nlashed round to form a sort of gunwale, to protect them from the spray;\r\nand after taking out a supply of biscuit for use, he nailed over the\r\nwhole of the packages the large sail they had brought away, to steady\r\nand preserve them from any injury from the waves.\r\n\r\nThe man they had rescued from death now awoke, and joined the rest: he\r\nwas a tall, powerful, savage-looking man, still wearing the convict\r\nuniform, so offensive to the taste of the civilized; and his manners\r\nwere rude and insolent.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no better prog than this poor stuff?\" said he, as his portion\r\nof biscuit and cup of water were offered to him. \"The Queen allows us\r\nbetter rations nor this, after your grand laws have made us out to be\r\nrogues.\"\r\n\r\n\"You fare as we do,\" answered Arthur, mildly. \"As long as we have\r\nbiscuit, you are welcome to share it. We make no distinctions in our\r\ncommon distress.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were a pack of fools,\" said the man, \"not to bring away something\r\nworth freightage, when you had space enough. Had you sense to fetch a\r\ncompass?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had no opportunity to secure chart or compass,\" replied Arthur.\r\n\"Besides, we were too thankful for the means God gave us to save our\r\nlives, to have many thoughts or cares about where we should go. We are\r\nin His hands, and I trust, by his mercy, may reach some safe harbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's as well to tell you beforehand,\" said the sailor, \"that you'd\r\nbetter not get it into your heads that you are going to give me up to\r\nhard labor and irons again. Wherever I set my foot on land I mean to be\r\nmy own master, and the first among you that peaches on me shall rue it.\"\r\nHere the man drew from his breast a brace of pistols, and added,--\"You\r\nsee I managed to keep my barkers safe. What would you say, man, to a\r\nball right through your ugly head?\"--and he presented the muzzle of the\r\npistol to Wilkins, who shrank behind Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"You must mean that threat for a jest, Peter,\" said Arthur, in a tone of\r\ndispleasure. \"If you are in earnest, I can only remind you that we also\r\nhave arms. I am commander here, and the first man on the raft that shows\r\nany signs of insubordination, I shall certainly shoot dead.\"\r\n\r\nPeter stared scornfully and vindictively at Arthur, but seeing his\r\nunmoved countenance, he turned off with a sort of laugh, and withdrew to\r\nthe stern of the raft.\r\n\r\n\"What a capital fellow Arty is, Hugh!\" whispered Gerald. \"See how he has\r\ncowed that huge bully. Are we not proud of our captain?\"\r\n\r\nTowards noon the heat of the sun became excessive, and was most\r\ndistressing to the voyagers exposed to its beams; Margaret and her\r\nfather especially suffered from it, till Jack contrived an ingenious\r\ncanopy for them by raising some spars, over which he spread the\r\nboat-cloaks, which the boys had fortunately worn to protect them from\r\nthe flames in the burning ship. As evening came on, the wind increased\r\nalarmingly, and they looked round anxiously to obtain some idea of their\r\nposition, till at last Wilkins pointed out some hazy dots on the wide\r\nocean desert, which he pronounced to be small islands.\r\n\r\n\"O Arthur,\" said Margaret, \"if it be possible, let us land on an island;\r\nI long to feel my feet on firm ground. Have you any idea what islands\r\nthese are?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ken'em,\" said Wilkins, \"and can tell ye they're all alike quite\r\ndissolute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I pray, Arthur,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"that we may avoid them. We had\r\nbetter continue to float on the solitude of the ocean, than seek the\r\nhaunts of the wicked.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys laughed; they understood better than their father the\r\npeculiarities of Wilkins's language, and Arthur said,--\"I have read,\r\npapa, that these north-western islands of Australia are generally small,\r\nbarren, and uninhabited. If we could safely land on one of them, it\r\nwould be desirable, that we might rest and improve our raft before we\r\nsought the mainland; but I fear they will be difficult of approach,\r\nfrom the coral reefs that surround them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which I long to behold, Arthur,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"and I beseech you\r\nto endeavor to reach one of these reefs. I have ever desired to look\r\nupon the work of those toiling, wonderful insects; minute agents of the\r\nOmniscient for mighty purposes, laboring incessantly to carry out the\r\nplans of creative wisdom.\r\n\r\n    'As the kings of the cloud-crowned pyramid\r\n    Their noteless bones in oblivion hid,\r\n    They slumber unmarked 'mid the desolate main,\r\n    While the wonder and pride of their works remain.'\"\r\n\r\nWilkins stared at the enthusiastic naturalist, and, turning to Arthur,\r\nsaid, \"Does he want us to land among them reefs, think ye? A bonnie\r\nclash we should have with this log float. If we'd had a few of them bark\r\nboats as them black fellows has up country, we might have made a shift;\r\nbut, ye see,\" indicating the fair sex by a finger pointed towards them,\r\n\"they'd make no hand of swimming among breakers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, they would not,\" answered Arthur; \"we must contrive some safer\r\nmethod for them, Wilkins. But if we could, by using our oars, draw near\r\nto these isles, I should like to inspect them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye cannot suspect 'em, sir,\" answered Wilkins, \"without ye were right\r\natop on 'em. Why, they're all dry and bare, and clear of aught but a few\r\nbirds but I'se willing to use an oar, if ye'd like to see 'em.\"\r\n\r\nIt was hard work rowing that heavy raft, and the ungrateful Peter\r\nrefused to assist, but sat apart, smoking cigars, of which, it appeared,\r\nhe had contrived to bring a box about his person; still before night\r\nthey had approached within a mile of a rocky island. Then the sudden\r\ndarkness of a tropical region surprised them, and compelled them to wait\r\nfor day, uneasy at the dangerous proximity of the coast, towards which,\r\nWilkins pointed out, a current seemed to be urging them.\r\n\r\n\"We must have all hands at work, captain,\" said he, \"to keep off them\r\nugly rocks. Come, Peter, man, take up an oar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" said the savage, \"I'se take a snooze; and when we're drifted a\r\nbit nigher hand, rouse me up, and I'll make a swim to shore. I've no\r\nmind for another capsize.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a service of toil and danger, and the active young men plied the\r\noars vigorously for hours, trusting they were standing safely off the\r\ndangerous reefs, till at last, worn out with fatigue, one after another\r\nthey dropped asleep.\r\n\r\nJack and Wilkins held out till a pale light showed them breakers close\r\nat hand, and they felt the current carrying them into the danger. It was\r\na moment of deep anxiety. \"See,\" said Wilkins, \"yon uncovered\r\nreef--let's try to get a bit nigher to it; then we'll knot a rope to our\r\nraft, and I'll swim off and find a way to moor it. If three on us were\r\natop on yon reef we might haul up t' rest on 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAll the youths were now roused, and anxious to share this service of\r\nperil, for all could swim: but Wilkins was strong, and the most\r\nexperienced; so while he tied one end of the rope round him, Arthur and\r\nJack secured the other end to the raft, and then they continued to hold\r\noff against the current as they watched the bold swimmer till they saw\r\nhim standing safely on the dry reef. In five minutes more they felt, by\r\nthe strain, that the rope was fast to the rock. Then Arthur went off\r\nwith a second rope, secured from danger by having the first to hold by\r\nif necessary. When he reached Will, he found the reef was broader and\r\nsafer than he had dared to hope, while beyond it the water was not more\r\nthan a foot deep to a shingly beach.\r\n\r\n\"If we had 'em all here, ye see,\" said Wilkins, \"they could easy wade\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what shall we do, Wilkins? what is our next step?\" asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"We must get more hands,\" answered he. \"And here's a canny opening,\r\nclear of breakers; we'll try to bring her in here.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after he had, with sailor's skill, secured the ropes to two huge\r\nfragments of rock, he continued,--\"Now, let's be off again, and see how\r\nwe can manage it. If we could get that big lubberly Black Peter to lend\r\na hand, he's a powerful chap at a tug.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he shall work or starve,\" said Arthur, firmly.\r\n\r\n\"That's the text, captain; stick to that,\" said Wilkins, as they plunged\r\ninto the water again.\r\n\r\nTheir return to the raft was easier than they had expected, for the tide\r\nwas ebbing, and already some of the rocks were bare which an hour before\r\nhad been covered with breakers; besides, the stretched ropes afforded a\r\nrest for the hands when they needed it. Arthur explained his plan to his\r\nfriends on the raft, and called on all hands to aid in propelling or\r\nhauling the raft towards the smooth opening in the reef.\r\n\r\n\"You must assist in hauling the ropes,\" said Arthur to Peter.\r\n\r\nThe man swore violently that he would never submit to be ordered by a\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\"I have the management of the party,\" answered Arthur, \"and all are\r\nwilling to obey me except you. Take your choice: if you refuse to share\r\nthe work, most assuredly you shall not share the rations.\"\r\n\r\nThe wretch darted a furious glance at Arthur, and put his hand into his\r\nbreast; but observing the little band had their eyes on him, he muttered\r\nwith a sneer, \"A parcel of fools!\" and plunged after Wilkins and Arthur\r\nto the reef, to tug at the ropes.\r\n\r\nThe raft had drifted among scattered rocks, and there was much\r\ndifficulty in preventing it from being dashed against them; but those\r\nleft upon it used long poles to push off from these dangers, while the\r\nmen on the reef continued to haul the ropes, in hopes of drawing the\r\nraft to the opening they wished it to enter, belaying the rope anew as\r\nthey gained a few yards. Slowly and painfully the work progressed;\r\nsometimes they snatched a moment for food and rest; sometimes the\r\nfaint-hearted threw down an oar or pole, as a strong wave cast them\r\nback, after they hoped they had made some way.\r\n\r\nAt length, wedged between two reefs that ran out to sea, they found they\r\ncould make no further progress, though there was yet a hundred yards of\r\ndeep water between the raft and the dry rocks to which the ropes were\r\nattached.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur saw this, he called out, \"Haul taught and belay the ropes;\r\nand now, how shall we convey the weak to the shore, Wilkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad job!\" growled he. \"We might swim out and trail 'em after us; but\r\nlikely they'd be flayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halloo! Arthur,\" called out Hugh, \"come over and see what we are\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur had reached the raft, he saw that Jack, with the help of the\r\nboys, had lashed together three or four light spars to form a sort of\r\n_catamaran_, large enough for one person to sit upon. To each end of\r\nthis they had attached a long rope, with one end of which Jack proposed\r\nto swim to the reef of refuge, ready to draw over in this float, one at\r\na time, those who were unable to swim; and he engaged, if the voyager\r\nonly kept quiet, there would be no danger; and though the raft was now\r\nfirmly fixed, it was probable it would be dashed to pieces at\r\nhigh-water, so no time must be lost to make the trial, that the lading\r\nas well as the passengers might be saved; and Jack set off with the rope\r\nround him.\r\n\r\nNow the question was, who would venture on this frail float the first?\r\nThe water looked dark and deep, and all shrunk back. At length it was\r\narranged that they should test the safety of it by first sending over a\r\npart of the freightage of the raft, as less valuable than human life.\r\nStill, these slender necessaries were precious to them, and they firmly\r\nlashed a part of the packages to the float, and anxiously launched and\r\nwatched the light raft until they saw it safely drawn to the reef and\r\nunladed by Jack. It was then hauled back, and Margaret, to encourage her\r\nfather, ventured next, her brothers having lashed her firmly down, and\r\ncharged her to be calm and motionless.\r\n\r\nAfter her safe arrival, Mr. Mayburn gained courage to follow her, and\r\nwas succeeded by Nurse Wilson. Ruth begged to carry her basket of fowls;\r\nbut was not permitted, which was fortunate for the chickens, for the\r\nterrified and restless girl, attempting to change her position, capsized\r\nthe frail bark; but Wilkins and Arthur swam out to her assistance, and\r\nsoon righted it, and, half-dead with fright and the salt water she had\r\nswallowed, she was turned over to Jenny, and the young men returned to\r\nthe raft to assist at the removal of the most valuable part of the\r\ncargo--the provisions, guns, and ammunition.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Peter had roused himself to take a trip to the raft,\r\nand when Arthur and Wilkins reached it, they found the ferocious man\r\nholding Hugh by the throat, and threatening to shoot him if he did not\r\ngive up one of the guns, which the boy held in the case firmly grasped\r\nin his hand, while Gerald was releasing the other gun from the covering,\r\nthat he might defend Hugh, and protect the powder and shot, which he\r\nguarded behind him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Wilkins and Arthur stepped out on the raft, the savage\r\nrelinquished his grasp of the boy; but called out in an insolent manner,\r\n\"Give me one of the guns, and my share of the powder and shot you\r\nbrought off. They are as much mine as yours, and I claim my right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, Peter,\" said Arthur; \"the guns are our own private\r\nproperty. The powder is not legally yours or ours; but the necessity of\r\nthe occasion caused us gladly to save it from destruction; at some\r\nfuture day we may be able to account for it to the owners. In the mean\r\ntime, I choose to keep possession of such a dangerous material; nor will\r\nI allow you to commit deeds of violence. We have saved your life, and\r\nsupplied you with food. If your nature does not prompt you to be\r\nthankful, at least be neutral; do not return evil for good.\"\r\n\r\nThe man did not answer, but there was a dogged look of ferocity in his\r\neyes, that plainly spoke his feelings; and Wilkins whispered to Arthur,\r\nas they were tying on the packages,--\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind our twisting a rope round his arms and legs, and giving\r\nhim a shove overboard? he's dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Wilkins,\" answered Arthur. \"Let the man live; we have no right to\r\nbe his executioners, though I believe he deserves death. If we all reach\r\nland safely, we must watch and guard against him; and, above all,\r\nWilkins, do you take care that he does not tempt you back to evil\r\ncourses.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'se see,\" answered the man, \"I'se not to reckon on; but I fancy I'd\r\nas lief take service with ye, as turn rogue again, with a cut-throat dog\r\nlike him.\"\r\n\r\nArthur earnestly hoped that they might be able to reclaim this\r\ngood-natured but ignorant man. He conversed kindly with him, as they\r\ncarefully and successfully managed the transit of the whole lading,\r\nincluding Ruth's chickens; and then, Wilkins taking the charge of the\r\ntwo young boys as they swam to the reef, Arthur remained a few minutes\r\nto cut away the ropes, which were too valuable to be abandoned, after\r\nwhich he signified to the apparently careless Peter that he must look to\r\nhis own safety.\r\n\r\n\"I see all that,\" said the man in a surly tone; \"depend on't, I shall\r\nnot stay here; you haven't got rid of me yet. So mind your own business,\r\nyoung fellow, and I'll mind mine.\"\r\n\r\nArthur left him and soon rejoined his friend; and Peter, drawing his\r\nknife and severing the cords that had lashed together the spars of the\r\nraft, he allowed them to float, and grasping one piece to support\r\nhimself, he swam to the dry reef.\r\n\r\nThe tide having now left the beach uncovered as far as this reef, the\r\nfamily went forward to the lofty cliffs which rose from the narrow\r\nshingly strand, and immediately began to remove their property to a\r\nsecure place above high-water mark.\r\n\r\n\"We may surely find a better spot for a night's encampment than this,\"\r\nsaid the indefatigable Arthur, when, resting from his labors, he looked\r\nup at the rocky heights. \"There appears to be a belt of trees further\r\nnorth, that might possibly afford more shelter. Can you walk as far,\r\npapa?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot exert myself more, my son,\" answered Mr. Mayburn. \"Let us\r\nremain here; in this delicious climate, from what I have read, the night\r\nwill produce no noxious vapor to harm us. Let us therefore offer our\r\nevening prayer to God, and rest calmly under the canopy of His skies,\r\nafter this day of trial and toil.\"\r\n\r\nThe word of the father was the law of his children; and after they had\r\nmade a sort of tent of the poles and sail from the raft, under which the\r\nboat-cloaks were spread, they joined in prayer and lay down to rest; but\r\nstill apprehensive of the evil disposition of Peter, each took an hour\r\nof watching to guard the packages till daylight. The brilliant light of\r\na tropical sun disclosed to the thoughtful castaways a smooth sea but a\r\nbarren coast, and they looked round in vain for the means of subsistence\r\nor escape. They saw Peter at some distance, dragging out of reach of the\r\ntide the timbers of the raft, which had been thrown upon the beach.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad he is so usefully employed,\" observed Mr. Mayburn. \"I trust\r\nhe feels ashamed of his ingratitude, and means to build us a hut with\r\nthese planks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not he,\" replied Wilkins; \"I ken him better nor that. He'd never fash\r\nto pick up them spars; but he wants 'em to use for his own purposes. But\r\nlet him be, let him be. Chaps like him is always twining a rope for\r\ntheir own necks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Wilkins,\" answered Margaret, \"we ought not to 'let him be;' we\r\nought to try and induce him to undertake some happier and more\r\nprofitable undertaking; do, Arthur, speak to the man.\"\r\n\r\nArthur and Jack walked down to the beach, while Ruth made a fire and\r\nboiled some water from the casks, to make tea, a supply of which, and a\r\nconsiderable quantity of sugar, being among the provisions they had\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Peter,\" said Arthur, \"you will need some breakfast, and such as\r\nwe have, we offer to you. What are you going to do with these spars?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are my property, by the laws of wrecking,\" grumbled the man, \"so\r\nkeep your mouth shut about them. I'll come to your breakfast, if I can\r\nget nought better nor your poor stuff.\"\r\n\r\nFinding all their approaches to intimacy with this sullen creature\r\nrepelled, they returned to the tent, where they found nurse in a state\r\nof great anger with Ruth the unlucky, who had literally _walked into_\r\nthe China breakfast service, which the considerate Jenny had herself\r\nbrought away from the ship, guarded on the wreck, and had just spread\r\nout on a clean napkin on the beach, when the girl being sent to summon\r\nMr. Arthur, had rushed through the midst of the crockery, of which only\r\nthe teapot and two cups escaped destruction. It was not in the nature of\r\nan Irish boy to be serious at such an accident, and O'Brien had laughed\r\nso provokingly, that Jenny was roused almost to distraction.\r\n\r\n\"A vagabond lass, as she is!\" she exclaimed. \"I blame myself, Miss\r\nMarget; I knew what was in her, and I ought to have seen to have had her\r\nshut up in one of them Union prison-houses. Nothing's safe where she\r\ncomes; and see now, we may just drink tea, sup and sup round.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we may be thankful we have tea, nurse,\" said Margaret. \"And see,\r\nhere is a tin cup we used for the water, may do duty instead of our\r\npretty Staffordshire ware.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we may meet with a china-shop before long, nurse,\" said Hugh. \"We\r\nare not so very far from the great Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Master Hugh,\" replied nurse, \"I don't pretend to know where we\r\nmay be; but there's little signs of shops or houses round us.----If that\r\ndoesn't beat all!\" exclaimed she, as Peter took up the cup of tea she\r\nhad prepared for her master, drank it scalding hot at once, and then\r\ncoolly sat down, drew out his knife and began to open and swallow\r\noysters, with which he had filled his cap.\r\n\r\n\"Shares!\" cried Wilkins, good-humoredly, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Seek them for yourself,\" said the churl, continuing his repast; on\r\nwhich Wilkins, calling on O'Brien to follow him, took his biscuit, and\r\nset out to search along the rocks. Margaret felt alarmed to see Gerald\r\naccompany this man; but Arthur assured her he believed Wilkins might be\r\ntrusted.\r\n\r\nIn a short time Gerald came running up to them, and throwing down a cap\r\nfilled with oysters, he cried out, \"Give us a rope, Jack! we have got a\r\nturtle, and turned him on his back, that he may not get back to the\r\nwater; but he is such a monstrous fellow that I don't know how we shall\r\nget him dragged all the way to this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then our best plan will be to go to him,\" answered Arthur; \"we have no\r\ntemptation to remain in this barren spot; and you seem to have found a\r\nland of plenty; therefore I propose we should march at once.\"\r\n\r\nEach took up some burthen to carry, leaving the casks and heavy packages\r\nfor the present, and moved forward to encamp in a new spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nA Pleasant Resting-place.--The Turtle.--A Knavish\r\nTrick.--Destitution.--An Exploring Expedition.--Lake Scenery.--A Wrecked\r\nVessel.--Strange Footsteps.--A Prudent Retreat.--Return of the\r\nExplorers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter walking about a quarter of a mile towards the north, they reached\r\na nook, surrounded by mangrove-trees, which, like the banyan-tree,\r\nformed bowers propped by pillars of successive trunks and stems, and\r\ninterwoven with roots and branches. At the part nearest to the sea, the\r\nlower branches were without leaves, and had been evidently laid bare by\r\nthe visits of the sea. These branches were now at low tide uncovered,\r\nand clustered with oysters. The mangrove-wood, spreading up the steep\r\ncliff, was backed by some loftier trees; and it appeared as if an\r\nimpenetrable barricade was formed by nature to forbid approach to the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nA niche formed by the up-rooting of some aged tree, of which few\r\nremnants remained, offered a shady retreat, much more attractive than\r\ntheir late exposed encampment. Then Jenny was shown the enormous turtle\r\nlying on its back, waiting for execution, the innumerable oysters\r\nclinging to the mangroves, the crabs crawling on the uncovered rocks,\r\nand the clouds of sea-birds sailing overhead or sitting stupidly on the\r\nrocks fishing; and, charmed with the promise of plenty, she said:\r\n\r\n\"We may do a bit here, Miss Marget, while this fine weather lasts, if we\r\ncan light on any fresh water. Birds and fish may serve us well enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where all those tall green trees grow,\" said Arthur, pointing to the\r\nheights, \"there must be water to be found; and, in the mean time, we\r\nhave a large cask, which we must bring up if we make an encampment\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have brought the kettle full,\" said Jenny, \"and a bag of biscuits\r\ntoo. We might have got more here, but nought would serve Ruth but hug\r\nthem weary chickens with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will die, shut up in that basket, Ruth,\" said Gerald. \"Come, Hugh,\r\nwhile Jack and Wilkins are killing that poor turtle, let us make a\r\npoultry-coop under the roots of the mangrove.\"\r\n\r\n\"Above high-water mark, remember, Gerald,\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, botheration! Arty,\" answered he; \"and you fancy I can't make a\r\nhencoop without a blunder; but you shall see.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys selected a space among the arched roots, out of reach of the\r\ntide, and interwove the sides with branches, making a snug and airy\r\ndwelling for the fowls, which rejoiced in their emancipation from the\r\nbasket; and the tropical shades were startled with the novel sound of\r\nthe crowing of a cock.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Jack and Wilkins had killed the turtle, cut the flesh\r\ninto pieces, and cleaned the strong back shell, which they proposed\r\nshould be useful; and, after a fire had been made, a portion of the\r\nturtle was cooked in its recent habitation, to the wonder and delight of\r\nJenny, who was in despair for cooking-vessels. Then the rest of the meat\r\nwas placed under the trees, in the most shady situation, and scattered\r\nover with the portion of salt they could spare from the small store\r\nthey had brought; but, in that sultry climate, they feared they should\r\nnot be able to preserve it more than one day.\r\n\r\n\"We could easily knock down a few of those boobies, if you would like\r\nthem, nurse,\" said Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, Hugh,\" said his father; \"with the abundance of food we\r\npossess, it would be merciless to destroy more life; and I am able to\r\nstudy the form and habits of the sluggish bird as conveniently while it\r\nis seated on that rock as if it lay dead on the beach.\"\r\n\r\nThe mosquitoes were so numerous among the trees in their new\r\nresting-place, that Mr. Mayburn, who suffered remarkably from the\r\nattacks of insects, was greatly distressed; and Margaret said to her\r\nbrothers:\r\n\r\n\"It will be impossible for papa to remain among these mosquito-haunted\r\ntrees; we must either try to penetrate further into the island, or we\r\nmust return to the bare and quiet rocky strand we have quitted. At all\r\nevents, we must have the sail brought to make a tent.\"\r\n\r\nIt was finally decided that after their dinner they would, for one night\r\nat least, return to their landing-place; and the turtle being cooked as\r\nwell as turtle could be cooked under such adverse circumstances, with\r\nNurse Wilson as _chef de cuisine_, they sat down to enjoy it. Knives and\r\nforks they possessed; plates they had not; but the shells of some of the\r\nlarge oysters tolerably well supplied the want. After they had dined,\r\nsultry as it was, they were glad to resume their burdens, and flee from\r\nthe venomous mosquitoes which followed them for some distance; but,\r\nunwilling to forsake the trees, their tormentors abandoned them when\r\nthey reached the bare cliffs.\r\n\r\nA cry of dismay from Hugh and Gerald, who had preceded the rest,\r\nannounced some vexatious catastrophe, and hurried them forward to see\r\nwith bitter mortification the disappearance of the casks and the various\r\npackages they had left on the spot where they landed.\r\n\r\n\"I mistrusted that rogue,\" exclaimed Wilkins, \"specially when he didn't\r\nturn up to his dinner. He's a deep un, and no mistake.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys went to the sea, now flowing over the reefs, and saw that the\r\nspars of the broken-up raft, which had been thrown on shore, were also\r\ngone. It was plain the artful villain had constructed another raft, and\r\nset out on it, carrying off their provisions, one of the guns, and the\r\npowder and shot.\r\n\r\n\"And worst of all,\" said Jack, \"my tool-chest, and my axe, which he\r\nborrowed from me this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"More fool you to lend it to him,\" said Wilkins, furiously enraged. \"It\r\nseems to me as how roguery thrives better nor aught, say what ye will\r\notherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak so foolishly, Wilkins,\" said Margaret. \"Wickedness can\r\nnever thrive, even on this earth. This bad man has probably run into\r\ngreater distress than he has left, with the added torment of a bad\r\nconscience. It is only when we walk in truth and honesty that we can\r\nhope for the protection of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where can the fellow mean to steer to?\" asked Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"With a light raft,\" answered Arthur, \"he may perhaps work round to the\r\neast of the island, if it be an island, and from thence he probably\r\nhopes to reach the mainland. We have sustained a heavy loss from his\r\nknavery; but we shall sleep sounder to-night from the knowledge that he\r\nis not near us.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a good night's rest, they arose to look round them and consider\r\nwhat was the best course in their destitute situation. Mr. Mayburn was\r\ndejected, Margaret was anxious, but the boys were full of hope and\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\"Hugh and Gerald,\" said Arthur, \"I call on you to listen seriously to\r\nme. It is all very well to hunt turtles, and I do not object to your\r\nknocking down a few boobies, for we must have the means of supporting\r\nlife; but we have a great object in view at present. We must ascertain\r\nwhere we are, and what step we are next to take. We cannot yet be sure\r\nthat this is, as we suspect, an island.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a desolate spot,\" said Margaret, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than Robinson Crusoe's island, Meggie,\" said Hugh, \"for we have\r\nnot even the goats. Not a four-footed animal have I set eyes on yet, and\r\nthe bipeds are few and ugly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we may not find some bipeds,\" said Arthur, \"that are more\r\noffensive than the gulls and boobies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, botheration!\" said Gerald. \"Sure you won't mean the savages, Arty.\r\nWhat jolly fun if we had an invasion! Wouldn't we drub them like British\r\nheroes as we are?\"\r\n\r\n\"And pray, most valiant knight of Ireland,\" answered Arthur, \"where are\r\nyour weapons of warfare?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, murder! what a blunderer I am!\" replied the boy; \"I had forgotten\r\nthe state of our armory. Let us consider. We have one rifle, with a\r\nsmall amount of ammunition, one bowie-knife, two penknives, one capital\r\nstick-knife, the table-knives, and----has anybody else any dangerous\r\nweapons?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a silver fruit-knife and a pair of scissors,\" said Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"Quite useless,\" replied he. \"Now, nurse, turn out your pockets.\"\r\n\r\nJenny produced a housewife, containing needles, thread, and scissors,\r\nthimble, a nutmeg-grater, a cork-screw, and the half-dozen useful forks.\r\nJack, always prudent, still retained in his pockets a large clasp-knife,\r\na hammer, and a few nails. Mr. Mayburn had a small microscope, forceps,\r\na case of delicate instruments of surgery, some blotting-paper, and a\r\nsketching-book and pencils; all of which were regarded with contempt by\r\nthe warrior Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"we must just set to work to make bows and arrows,\r\npikes and clubs. Those trees we saw yesterday will supply us with\r\nmaterials.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will trouble you, then,\" said Arthur, \"to take your axe and cut down\r\na tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you are caught again, Pat,\" said Hugh. \"Another blunder! Poor\r\nunhappy fellows we are; destitute of means, we can neither fight nor run\r\naway, if this be an island we have been thrown on.\"\r\n\r\n\"That brings us to the point again,\" said Arthur. \"That is the thing\r\nnecessary to be known; so, without further delay, we three will set out\r\nand make a careful inspection of the coast. We will leave Wilkins and\r\nJack to guard the encampment; I will carry the rifle and the few charges\r\nwe have left, but I trust I may not be called on to use them, for I\r\nshould grudge them exceedingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shed no blood, I beseech you, my son,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"We are\r\nintruders; do not let us become invaders. If we can obtain immunity for\r\nourselves, let us be satisfied. Even if we should be attacked, we have\r\nno right to retaliate, but should rather take to flight.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, dear papa,\" answered Hugh, \"we cannot fly without wings. We are at\r\nbay here, and must fight or fall. But, depend on it, we shall be\r\ncautious, with Arthur the prudent to lead us; and remember, this is only\r\nan exploring and foraging expedition.\"\r\n\r\nThe bold little party then set out towards the mangrove-wood, through\r\nwhich, with much toil and many windings, they forced their way, and\r\ngained more open ground. They crossed the bed of a river, which was now,\r\nhowever, but a series of muddy pools, from which, though anxious to have\r\na draught of fresh water, they felt no inclination to drink. Beyond this\r\nspot some low bare sandhills rose, which they crossed, and thence to a\r\nsteep eminence. They climbed up this, and found themselves among vast\r\npiles of rocky fragments mixed with tall wiry grass.\r\n\r\nThey looked round; all was silence and desolation, the barren chaotic\r\nscenery being varied only by the tall bare trunks of a species of\r\nacacia, which here and there broke the monotony of the prospect; and now\r\nthe boys felt convinced that they were placed on a truly desert island.\r\n\r\nStill they moved forwards, though depressed and silent, over the dismal\r\nwilderness; till at length they were cheered by the sight of vegetation,\r\nand hailed with pleasure some tall trees. Arthur recognized the\r\ncabbage-palm, the slender stem sixty feet in height, with the round tuft\r\nof edible leaves at the summit. Hugh would willingly have tried to climb\r\nthe tree to procure the leaves, but his brother persuaded him to defer\r\nthe exploit till a more favorable opportunity, and pointed out to him a\r\nfringe of the graceful casuarina, which promised the blessing of water.\r\nThey made up to it, and found it bordered a broad and glittering lake,\r\nin the clear waters of which they distinguished multitudes of large\r\nfish, while on the banks the noisy water-fowl were building their nests.\r\nThe edge of the lake was stuck over with fresh-water mussels; and but\r\nfor the flies and mosquitoes which haunted the trees, this spot appeared\r\na terrestrial paradise compared with the dreary bay they had left.\r\n\r\n\"This is the place for our camp and fortress,\" said Hugh; \"let us bring\r\nup our rear-guard at once. We shall have the lake for our water-tank,\r\nand its feathered and finny inhabitants for our rations.\"\r\n\r\n\"And these winged monsters for our besieging foes,\" added Gerald,\r\nstriking a mosquito from his nose.\r\n\r\n\"It is a pleasant and tempting situation, certainly,\" said Arthur; \"and\r\nwe might select a spot sufficiently distant from the water to avoid\r\nthese bloodthirsty insects. But we must be certain that we shall have no\r\nneighbors more dangerous than the mosquitoes. We had better explore to\r\nthe coast.\"\r\n\r\nHugh and Gerald had contrived to knock down two pairs of ducks, which\r\nthey slung across their shoulders, and marched forward towards more\r\nfertile plains, where high grass and low bushes spread a verdant\r\ncovering over the soil, till they reached a thick wood, sloping\r\ndownwards, through which they penetrated, and found themselves on a\r\nnarrow strand, similar to that on which they had landed.\r\n\r\nA rocky promontory ran out to the sea at a little distance; the broken,\r\nrugged, rocky sides were clothed with brushwood, and a lofty headland\r\njutted out at the summit. Their further progress would have been cut off\r\nhad it been quite high water; but the tide was still low enough to\r\npermit them, with some care, to turn round the promontory, and gain a\r\nbroader strand, which was strewed with huge fragments of rock, amongst\r\nwhich they saw, with great astonishment, the wreck of a large vessel\r\nlying. The hull was divided; the forecastle-deck was in one place, and\r\nat a distance lay part of the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\nAt first the boys were struck speechless with this unexpected sight;\r\nthen they began to climb over the rocks to reach the wreck, and Gerald\r\nbreathlessly asked: \"Will we find any of them alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alive, man!\" exclaimed Hugh. \"You may see at once this is no recent\r\naffair; look at this chain, the sea must have washed over it some\r\nhundreds of times, for it is covered with rust.\"\r\n\r\nThe sea was even now breaking over the scattered rocks, making the\r\napproach to the wreck at once difficult and dangerous; but the boys made\r\nout that the vessel must have been first thrown on the rocks, and\r\nafterwards broken up by the sea. It now remained a melancholy spectacle;\r\ntimbers, decks, masts, and yards, scattered or piled in confused heaps,\r\napparently untouched by man for weeks or months. The upper parts of the\r\nstern and hull as far forward as the mizen chains were entire, lying on\r\nthe stern-frames; but no bodies were found, and the boats being missing,\r\nArthur suggested that the crew must have got off, carrying with them the\r\nuseful articles they might need; for little could be seen except the\r\nmere timbers, except that where the marks of an axe were found on the\r\nmizen-mast, the axe itself, though much rusted, was lying near, and\r\ngladly seized by the boys.\r\n\r\n\"Margaret will become alarmed,\" said Arthur, \"if we delay our return;\r\nbut to-morrow we must examine this wreck more closely. Much has\r\ndoubtless been carried off by the boats or the waves; but even the yards\r\nand chains may be useful to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could find any thing to eat,\" sighed Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Depend on it, Gerald,\" said Hugh, \"the greedy sea will have devoured\r\nthe provisions. I cannot even see an empty cask which might be useful.\r\nBut, halloo! captain, our retreat is cut off; the sea is washing the\r\nheadland, and we may be glad to use the old hull as an ark now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we may be able to turn the next point,\" said Arthur, pointing\r\nto another jutting rock of the indented coast which stood out about a\r\nhundred yards in the opposite direction, and where a sort of shelf a few\r\nfeet from the water afforded an unsafe pass. \"Be quick, boys; we must\r\nbeat the waves if we would escape before next tide.\"\r\n\r\nAway the daring boys darted among the windings and over the barriers of\r\nbroken rock, till they reached the second promontory, and with the waves\r\ndashing close below them, rounded it, coming out on an almost impassable\r\nnarrow hem of encumbered beach, which stretched before them for several\r\nhundred yards. Crawling close to the cliffs, they found at length the\r\nstrand grew broad and level, and they sprang forward to enjoy more\r\nfreedom, when they were suddenly startled by the sight of the shell of\r\na turtle, which they could not but suspect the hand of man had removed\r\nfrom the back of the rightful proprietor.\r\n\r\nThey looked intently on it, then Arthur said, \"This shell has\r\nundoubtedly been roughly cut from the animal. The important question is,\r\nwho cut it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the crew of the wrecked vessel,\" suggested Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"It may have been so,\" answered Arthur, somewhat relieved.\r\n\r\nThen O'Brien shouldered the large shell, and they moved forward\r\nthoughtfully for a few minutes; till a dark spot at some distance from\r\nthe water attracted the attention of Arthur; they hastened towards it,\r\nand saw to their great consternation, not only the traces of a recent\r\nfire, but the naked footmarks of men, the head of a turtle still bloody,\r\na long wooden spear, plainly hardened by fire, and an instrument which\r\nArthur recognized from description to be a throwing-stick for the spear,\r\nas it had a hook at one end which fitted a notch at the heel of the\r\nspear, which the holders were thus enabled to project with great force.\r\n\r\n\"We must carry away these curious arms,\" said Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, I think,\" replied Arthur. \"In the first place, we have\r\nno right to take them, since they have been left here in good faith, as\r\nwe might have left our spades in our own grounds at home; and next we\r\nshould thus place ourselves in the position of invaders and marauders,\r\nand incur the enmity of dangerous foes. We had better obliterate all\r\ntraces of our visit, and, like prudent fellows, retreat quietly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Run away! Arthur,\" exclaimed O'Brien. \"You may as well speak plainly.\r\nAnd won't Margaret think us a set of poltroons?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will talk of that as we retreat,\" said Arthur, laughing; \"but we\r\nmust carefully examine the way we came, that we may leave no footsteps.\"\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the vivacity and restless curiosity of the boys had\r\ninduced them to keep close to the cliffs, leaping from rock to rock,\r\npeeping into crannies for nests, so that no traces were left, except\r\nwhere the tide would soon wash them away, and Arthur resolved now to\r\nascend the cliffs at once, instead of going round the island, to escape\r\nany risking of meeting the savages. He calculated that they had reached\r\na part of the shore nearly opposite to that on which they had first\r\nlanded; and by directly crossing the island, which he felt could not be\r\nmore than three miles over, they might safely and speedily rejoin their\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think it probable,\" he said, \"that this barren island has any\r\npermanent inhabitants. The people who have left their traces on the\r\ncoast may come over from some more productive soil, solely to catch the\r\nturtles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think they came from the mainland?\" asked Hugh; \"I fancied from\r\nthe heights of the east cliffs, I could make out a gray line, which was\r\ndoubtless Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely can fancy,\" answered Arthur, \"that a people whom we have\r\nseen described as so deficient in intelligence should be able to\r\nconstruct canoes to come such a distance. It is more likely they are\r\ninhabitants of one of the hundred dangerous islands of this sea. It\r\nwill be prudent, at all events, to avoid them if we can.\"\r\n\r\nAs they rapidly made their way directly across the island, O'Brien\r\nwished there had been a boat left on the wreck, and Hugh said, \"Couldn't\r\nwe build a boat, Arthur? Jack is up to any work of that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have not tools or time, Hugh,\" answered Arthur. \"Only consider how\r\nlong it would take, even if we had the means, to complete a boat to be\r\nuseful to us. No; at present we must content ourselves to make the best\r\nof our situation; and as I do not think the savages have found the bay\r\nof the wrecked vessel, I shall propose that we move our encampment into\r\nthat snug nook.\"\r\n\r\n\"What capital fun,\" cried Gerald. \"We will bring them off directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Softly, good youth!\" said Arthur. \"We must hold a council on such an\r\nimportant matter. But see Jack perched on yon tall tree, to watch for us\r\nand give notice; and here comes Meggie to meet us and hear the news.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe Results of the Expedition.--The Long Vacation.--Removed from the\r\nLanding-place.--Birds and their Nests.--Fishing.--Tapping a Cask of\r\nPotatoes.--Tent-making.--The Shell Spades.--Digging a Tank.--A Grand\r\nAttempt at Boat-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Get all into marching order, Meggie,\" said Hugh. \"We have found out a\r\nbetter site for a settlement than our present encampment, and Gerald and\r\nI mean to build a shealing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And not a mangrove or a mosquito to be seen near it,\" added Gerald;\r\n\"nothing but a ship at anchor.\"\r\n\r\n\"A ship!\" exclaimed Margaret, in astonishment. \"What does the wild boy\r\nmean, Arthur?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will only see the remains of a ship, Meggie,\" answered Arthur; \"and\r\nthough you may think the scene of a shipwreck a melancholy spot to\r\nselect, yet it seems a convenient, sheltered cove, and a desirable\r\nretreat for a short time, till we arrange our plans for the future.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the encampment, and the adventures of the day had\r\nbeen told, Jack heard with especial interest the account of the wrecked\r\nvessel; and as he examined the rusty axe, he planned great undertakings\r\nwith the aid of his new tool; while Jenny looked with much satisfaction\r\non the ducks, which she declared were \"more Christian meat than them\r\nslimy, fat turtles;\" and Ruth, smoothing the beautiful plumage with her\r\nhands, and thinking, with foreboding dread, of the fate of her\r\nfavorites, said--\r\n\r\n\"Bonnie things! what a sham' to kill 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"And see what papa and I have found,\" said Margaret, producing a basket\r\nhalf-filled with the eggs of the turtle, while Jenny served up to them\r\nsome roasted in the ashes, which the hungry ramblers thought delicious.\r\n\r\nThen a consultation was held on the project of removal. Margaret shrunk\r\nfrom any risk of meeting with the savage islanders; but Arthur\r\nconsidered they should be safer from any encounter with them in the\r\nsecluded nook they had discovered, which was guarded by coral reefs,\r\ndangerous even to such light canoes as these people usually had, and\r\nhidden by the jutting promontories, than they should be to remain in\r\ntheir present exposed encampment, or even in the more fertile regions of\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn had some shadowy fancies of civilizing and converting the\r\nwhole horde at once; but Arthur argued that the time was not favorable\r\nfor the undertaking, and that they must try to establish themselves in a\r\nmore independent position before they indulged any hopes of reclaiming a\r\nlarge body of heathens.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, papa,\" added he, \"we must look forward to some plan of leaving\r\nthis dull and desolate island, and we may have an opportunity of\r\nsignalling some passing sail if we establish ourselves on the beach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll not see mony ships amang yon reefs,\" said Wilkins, \"barring\r\nthey're drove there in a gale, and then, as ye've seen, there's poor\r\nchance of they're getting off again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we might build a boat with the remains of the wreck,\" suggested\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n\"There's some sense in that,\" answered the man; \"but when ye've gotten\r\nyour boat fettled up, what port would ye be making for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am pledged to go to India, Wilkins,\" said Mr. Mayburn.\r\n\r\n\"Pledged to a fiddlestick,\" replied he, with contempt. \"Think ye now ye\r\ncan sail to Indy in a crazy bit boat like what we chaps can put\r\ntogether. Ye'll have to make right across for t' mainland; and mind what\r\nI tell ye: I'se stick to ye, and work for ye, and fight for ye, but\r\nye're not to be 'liv'ring me up at Sydney yonder to be shackled and\r\ndrove like a nigger slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear, Wilkins,\" answered Arthur, \"there is little probability of our\r\nreaching Sydney; but we are all too grateful for the services of a\r\nfaithful adherent, to think of returning evil for them; and you may be\r\nsatisfied we shall continue to protect you to the utmost of our power.\r\nAnd, my dear father, you must no longer distress yourself with the idea\r\nof fulfilling your appointment in India. We shall be reported lost in\r\nthe _Golden Fairy_, and the mission will be filled up. You must resign\r\nyourself to accept any safe refuge that is accessible, and wait for\r\nhappier circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time, papa,\" said Margaret, \"God will surely provide us\r\nwith work. And till we have more extended opportunities our own hearts\r\nrequire our labor. We must not neglect our duty at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, my child,\" answered he, \"for reminding me of my wasted\r\nhours. It is indeed full time that I should resume the active duties of\r\nmy profession. I have a weighty responsibility. Do you not think that I\r\nshould begin at once, by recalling my boys to their daily studies?\"\r\n\r\nO'Brien looked piteously at Hugh, who laughed at his mournful\r\ncountenance, and Margaret replied,\r\n\r\n\"The boys are not idle, papa. They are studying in the great book of\r\nNature. Every hour shows to them some new wonder of creation, and raises\r\ntheir thoughts to the mighty Creator. Every sight and sound develops a\r\nnew idea; and all you are called on to do, papa, is to watch and to\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all I am fit to do,\" answered he. \"I want the energy and\r\nfirmness that you possess--a blessed boon from God. The deep sorrow that\r\never haunts me is, that my life has been spent in vain purposes, never\r\naccomplished.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, conscientious father,\" said Margaret, \"be comforted; I trust\r\nthe hour may yet come when you will have a field for your pious labors:\r\ntill then, have no remorse in following your simple and blameless\r\namusements. I have no merit in my duties of attending, governing, and\r\nlecturing these wild boys. I love the office; I was certainly not born\r\nfor any sphere more elevated. But you, papa, whose sole enjoyment is to\r\nsit in an easy-chair before a table laden with books and a cabinet\r\nfilled with eggs and wings, were wrenched violently from your nature\r\nwhen you were doomed to pass days in forcing these unwilling boys to\r\nlearn the rules of syntax, or the crabbed mysteries of Euclid. We are\r\nshaken from our proprieties here; you cannot teach Latin or work out\r\nproblems without books; so you must take your ease, and consider this\r\nthe long vacation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the girl for knowing a few things, Meggie!\" said O'Brien,\r\nadmiringly. \"Be sure, sir, Hugh and I will work to any amount to help\r\nyou in your ornithology and oology, if you will spare us the philology\r\na bit. There's no running about with a conjugation in one's mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And as Arthur has demonstrated his problem on the best position for the\r\nencampment,\" said Hugh, \"I conclude we had better move at once. No\r\noccasion to send forward notice about well-aired beds.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no occasion, Hugh Harebrain,\" said Arthur, \"to be overtaken by\r\ndarkness on our journey. Let us be deliberate. Jenny must roast the\r\nducks for our breakfast in the morning, Jack must collect his valuable\r\nwork-tools, Ruth must again imprison those luckless chickens, and then\r\nwe must all have a night's rest. It will be time enough to set out in\r\nthe morning, and we must take care to start before the sun blazes out in\r\nall its fervor.\"\r\n\r\nAll obeyed orders; and, with the first ray of light, the whole camp was\r\nalive. It was very important this time that nothing should be left\r\nbehind. Peter had relieved them from the charge of biscuit and water,\r\nwhich he had carried off with the tool-chest and gun; but there was\r\nstill a little tea and sugar, which was carefully preserved. The\r\nsail-cloth was rolled up; even the oars used for tent-poles were taken;\r\nand, after morning prayers, they set out slowly along the beach, and\r\nthrough the mazy, ascending woods, till they reached the table-land of\r\nthe rocky isle. They crossed it this time at the head of the lake which\r\nthey had discovered the preceding day, and found this part of the island\r\nstill more fertile and lovely than any they had yet seen. Mr. Mayburn\r\nwas in ecstasy; he stopped continually to point out some new and\r\nbeautiful grass, some bright nameless flower, or some strange tree;\r\nwhile the notes, harsh, musical, or merry, of thousands of birds, filled\r\nhim with amazement and delight.\r\n\r\n\"From this moment, my boys,\" said he, \"I release you from the severe\r\nstudies which, Margaret truly observes, are unfitted to our\r\ncircumstances and the relaxing climate. I merely require from you to\r\nobtain me specimens--single specimens only--of the eggs and nests of\r\nthese birds; and, if it were not cruel, I should long to possess some of\r\nthese rare creatures in all their beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear, papa,\" observed Margaret, \"that you have no means of preserving\r\nbirds; therefore it would be useless to take them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Margaret,\" he answered. \"I will be content with a nest\r\nand an egg of each species.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind about having the nest and egg of that fellow, sir?\"\r\nasked O'Brien, pointing to a majestic black swan sailing on the lake.\r\n\r\n\"_Rara avis!_\" exclaimed he; then added, with a sigh, \"no, no, Gerald,\r\nwe have no means. The animal is weighty, therefore the nest must be\r\nlarge, and not of a portable nature. I relinquish the precious\r\npossession. But let us linger on the borders of the lake, to examine its\r\nwild charms. Would that I had saved my botanical library, that I might\r\nhave made out the species of these broad flags and thick bamboos!\"\r\n\r\n\"These round reeds will make capital arrows,\" said Hugh, cutting down a\r\nbundle of them; \"and I doubt not but some of them would be elastic\r\nenough for the bows. We may surely, with all our learning, succeed\r\nbetter in making them than untaught savages. Then we may bring down our\r\nbirds noiselessly, and defy the thievish tricks of Black Peter.\"\r\n\r\n\"But first, Hugh,\" said O'Brien, \"we must have a trial with some of\r\nthese big fellows in the lake,\" pointing to some large perch-shaped\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nJack sharpened some of the reeds to a point, and the boys were soon\r\nplunging about in the clear bright lake, pursuing and striking the fish;\r\nand after fifty vain attempts, they succeeded at length in spearing two,\r\nwhich, though young, were of large size, and Arthur concluded they must\r\nbe the river cod (_Grystes Peelii_), so much praised by Australian\r\ntravellers. Then, regardless of wet garments, which the hot sun soon\r\ndried, the boys triumphantly proceeded on with their spoil. Jack, in the\r\nmean time, had struck off from the edge of the lake a cluster of\r\nfresh-water mussels of various sizes, and emptied them, to serve for\r\nspoons and drinking-cups.\r\n\r\nThence they moved forward, anxious now to seek some shelter from the\r\nincreasing heat of the day, and gladly entered the wood, from which,\r\nwith some difficulties in the descent, they reached the wreck-encumbered\r\nbay. All were at once attracted to the side of the vessel; Jack,\r\nespecially, examined it with intense interest, considering its future\r\nservice to him. Margaret and her father were moved to tears, as they\r\ncontemplated the shattered fabric, and thought on the brave but probably\r\nunprepared men who might have been hurried into eternity before the\r\nfinal catastrophe.\r\n\r\nWhile Hugh and Gerald climbed the sides to explore the interior of the\r\nwreck, Arthur observed that some of the timbers had been carried away by\r\nthe tide even since the previous day, and he consulted with Jack about\r\nthe possibility of breaking up and endeavoring to save such parts as\r\nmight be useful to themselves; and in order to lose no time they\r\ngrasped a loosened plank, to draw it away beyond the reach of the tide.\r\nNo sooner had they removed it, than a large cask rolled from the\r\nopening, which they concluded led into the hold. The cask broke open\r\nwith the fall, and a number of potatoes ran out. Every hand was quickly\r\nsummoned to collect and save the valuable contents; the cask was righted\r\nand carefully removed up the beach, and it was great amusement to the\r\nboys to pursue the straggling potatoes, and save them from being swept\r\naway by the next tide.\r\n\r\n\"I say, O'Brien, my boy, I wonder your Irish nose did not scent the\r\n_pratees_ yesterday,\" said Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"Now isn't it luck, Arty,\" said Gerald. \"Will we plant some? and then we\r\nshall never want as long as we stay here.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret looked alarmed at the plan of planting potatoes for future\r\nprovision; but Arthur replied, he hoped they should be able to leave the\r\nisland before the potatoes were exhausted; nevertheless, he approved of\r\nthe provident project of Gerald, and promised to seek a favorable spot\r\nto plant some, for the benefit of future visitors to this unproductive\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\"But do not be afraid, nurse,\" added he, \"to boil us a large _shell_ of\r\npotatoes to-day; we have abundance; and in our scarcity of bread, we\r\ncould not have found a more valuable prize.\"\r\n\r\nRuth had been in the wood to seek for a convenient place for a hencoop,\r\nand now rushed out with torn garments, exclaiming,--\"Oh! Miss Marget,\r\ncome and see what a bonnie beck there is.\"\r\n\r\nA _beck_, or stream of water, was, indeed, a valuable discovery; and,\r\nconducted by Ruth, Arthur and Jack forced their way through entangled\r\nroots and brushwood, till they reached a narrow rivulet of clear water,\r\nprobably flowing from the lake by some unseen channel beneath the grassy\r\nregion they had crossed; and after trickling down the rocks, it again\r\ndisappeared in the sand and shingles of the beach.\r\n\r\n\"This is but a slender supply, Jack,\" said Arthur; \"I fear it might fail\r\nus in a drought.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must dig a tank, Mr. Arthur,\" he answered; \"that is, if we can raise\r\na spade.\"\r\n\r\nJack considered for a few minutes. He was not to be checked by apparent\r\ndifficulties in his undertakings. \"What do you think, Mr. Arthur, of one\r\nof those big oyster or mussel shells? I could tie one to a stick with\r\nsome of these stringy fibres of creeping plants; or, better far, there's\r\na tree up above, that seems to have a bark you might ravel out into\r\nstrings; and there's another tree, with a stiff, regular sort of gum, as\r\ngood as glue, oozing out of it. Now, with all these, I'll be bound to\r\nmake a spade or two that will turn up this light soil fast enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the sooner we set about it the better, Jack,\" answered Arthur. \"We\r\ncannot do better than remain in this spot, if we meet with no\r\ndisturbance, until we can make some canoe or raft to take us off; and it\r\nis absolutely necessary to secure a supply of water. Let us go and\r\nchoose our shells.\"\r\n\r\nBut when they returned to the beach, they found Mr. Mayburn so much\r\novercome by the scorching heat of the sun, that their first care was to\r\nget up a tent or shelter of some kind for him. They selected a deep\r\nniche in the cliff, where the rocks formed a complete angle, and having\r\nprocured from the wreck some suitable spars, they fixed them in the\r\ncrevices of the rocks, to form the rafters of the roof, which they\r\ncovered with the long grass which grew above the cliffs. The sail was\r\nthrown over the front, as a curtain, and they were thus provided with a\r\nshady and convenient apartment.\r\n\r\nAt low tide, Hugh and Gerald amused themselves with searching for nests\r\nin the extremity of the promontory, and finding an opening, they had\r\npenetrated into a spacious cave, the mouth of which would be covered at\r\nhigh-water; but as it shelved upwards to a considerable distance in the\r\nrocks, the back part was safe and dry.\r\n\r\n\"Just think, Hugh, my boy,\" said O'Brien, \"what a fortress this would be\r\nfor us if we were invaded. One man could defend the entrance with the\r\ngun, even at low-water; and how we should defy the rogues when the tide\r\nwas up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it would be horribly dismal, Gerald,\" answered Hugh. \"We could\r\nnever bear to live in it long; and, you know, we need no sleeping-rooms\r\nor houses to cover us in this fine climate; so we will leave it\r\nuninhabited, at least in peaceful times. But we will show it to Arthur,\r\nand ask him if it would not make a good storehouse.\"\r\n\r\nArthur congratulated the boys on their discovery, and the timid father\r\nwas highly gratified at the thoughts of such a secure retreat; after he\r\nhad satisfactorily ascertained that it could always be accessible at\r\nlow-water, and never dangerous at the highest tide; and Margaret\r\nproposed that the cookery should be accomplished within the cave, that\r\nthe smoke might not attract the observation of the dreaded natives. So\r\nJenny established her kitchen here, and prepared an excellent dinner of\r\nfish, and potatoes boiled in the shells of the turtle, while Margaret\r\nkept watch for the returning tide, though Jenny said, \"It's all little\r\nuse, Miss Marget; it has to be, I feel. Ruth's sartain to be catched and\r\nfastened up in this eerie place.\"\r\n\r\nJack made a careful inspection of the remains of the vessel, and from\r\nthe stern cabin, which was still uninjured, he drew out, with the help\r\nof the boys, a rough bench and a table,--useful acquisitions; and still\r\nbetter, a good-sized empty cask, which had contained brandy, and was now\r\nconveniently employed as a water-cask. Then, after a long survey of the\r\nstate of the timbers, Jack announced that, with the help of Wilkins's\r\nstrong arm, and Arthur's judgment and perseverance, he would undertake\r\nto build a sort of boat.\r\n\r\nWilkins shrugged up his shoulders at the prospect of hard work under a\r\nburning sun, and said, \"Why, one had as lief be working in irons down\r\nyonder; where one was safe of full rations, and bacca, and rum into t'\r\nbargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And ruin to body and soul, you may add, unhappy man,\" said Mr. Mayburn.\r\n\"Be not discontented that the mercy of God has rescued you from evil,\r\nand cast you among true friends, who ask you to do no more than they do\r\nthemselves; to fare simply, and to work. You were not placed in this\r\nworld to live like the beasts, who eat, and drink, and perish for ever.\r\nYour life is here but the beginning of eternity; the hour of death is\r\nclose at hand to all, when those who have done evil shall receive their\r\npunishment, and those who have listened to God shall find a blessed home\r\nin a new and glorious world.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins never replied to any of Mr. Mayburn's _preachings_, as he called\r\nthese admonitions; but he scoffed less than formerly, and Margaret\r\nobserved that his manners were somewhat softened; and she daily prayed\r\nto God that they might be permitted to aid in reclaiming, at least, one\r\nsinful soul.\r\n\r\nThe next day Jack succeeded in binding two large shells to stout\r\nhandles, and fixing them with gum; then, while he left them to harden,\r\nhe set to work to clean the rusty axe with sand and stones, and at\r\nlength rendered it serviceable. He was thus enabled to break up the\r\nwreck, and to select such timber as would be useful for his projected\r\nundertaking; he extracted all the large nails that were uninjured, and\r\nafter many days' labor, had accumulated materials to begin his great\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut the first employment of the youths was to be digging the well; they\r\nwent every morning to the lake to procure fish, birds, or eggs, for the\r\nprovision of the day, and then returned to assist in digging, the spades\r\nbeing now available, as the gum had become as hard as the shell. After\r\nthey had sunk the tank sufficiently deep, they lined it with flat\r\nstones; and saw with great satisfaction, that they need never be without\r\na supply of fresh water, if they remained at this cove.\r\n\r\nSome time passed, and they saw no more traces of visitors to the island,\r\nand they ventured to ramble to some distance along the beach, bringing\r\nin occasionally a turtle, or a basket of turtles' eggs, to vary their\r\ndiet. They also used daily a small quantity of potatoes, but they were\r\neconomical with these valuable roots, of which they hoped to raise a\r\ncrop in the island, and, should they ever reach it, on the main land as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nAfter the tank was completed, Jack selected a spot conveniently near\r\nhigh-water mark, and seriously set about boat-building. He had carefully\r\nexamined the boats during their voyages, and while in the _Amoor_ he\r\nmade many inquiries of the obliging ship-carpenter; but though bold and\r\nsanguine in all his enterprises, he did sometimes feel that he had\r\nundertaken a stupendous task.\r\n\r\nThe planks that would best have suited his purpose were more or less\r\ninjured by the sea; he had no means of forming iron bolts or screws, yet\r\nthe indefatigable youth persevered; but the month of August, the early\r\nspring of that climate, was advanced before the boat assumed a form of\r\npromise. It was then caulked with matted cordage found in the vessel,\r\nand with gum, of which they had abundance. Now, though rough and clumsy,\r\nJack declared it \"looked like work;\" and after two pair of oars had been\r\nmade with little difficulty, to the great delight of the young workmen,\r\na day was fixed for launching the boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Launch of the Boat.--An Alarming Catastrophe.--Disappointed\r\nHopes.--Jack's Perseverance.--A Peep at the Old Encampment.--Black Peter\r\nagain.--The Loss of the Boat.--Canoe-building.--The Luggage-van.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to carry the boat fairly out to deep water, to test its\r\nperfect security; but the reefs were impassable before the cove, and\r\nthey were aware they should be compelled to row to some distance within\r\nthem till they found an opening. A roller, left in the wreck, enabled\r\nthem at high-water to run out the boat, and Wilkins and Arthur\r\nvolunteered to make the first trial in it. Jack was detained on shore,\r\nwhere he was always usefully employed, and the two boys were considered\r\ntoo wild to be risked in the first trip--an arrangement which they would\r\ngladly have rebelled against.\r\n\r\nThe anxious watchers stood on shore to mark the boat first float on the\r\nwater, and then the strokes of the oars, which carried it round the\r\npromontory at the south out of their sight. Then Jack and the two boys\r\nascended through the wood to the heights, and crossed the cape, to watch\r\nthe further progress of the precious vessel. But what was their\r\nconsternation to see no traces of it. They hurried down to the beach\r\nbeyond the promontory, and gazed wildly around, uttering cries of\r\ndistraction. A few minutes of horror succeeded: then they saw the heads\r\nof the two swimmers, who appeared to be struggling violently against\r\nthe receding waves.\r\n\r\nThe two boys would have plunged at once into the water; but Jack, in a\r\ntone of authority, commanded them to remain still, and throwing off his\r\nown light frock, he rapidly cut a long branch of mangrove, and swam out,\r\nholding it out towards Arthur, who seemed nearly exhausted, and who\r\neagerly clutched the branch as soon as it was within his reach. Then\r\nJack turned round, and swimming with one hand, drew the almost senseless\r\nArthur, still firmly grasping the branch, after him into shallow water,\r\nwhere Hugh was waiting to receive him. Still fresh and unfearing, Jack\r\nset out again towards Wilkins, who had grasped an oar and was supporting\r\nhimself with it, when, just as he saw his friend coming up to aid him,\r\nhe either dropped the oar from exhaustion, or some unseen rock dashed it\r\nfrom his hand, and he immediately disappeared.\r\n\r\nA great cry rose from the boys on the beach; but the minute after, he\r\nrose again, lying on his back, and apparently insensible. This enabled\r\nJack to approach him with greater safety, and catching hold of his long\r\nhair, he drew the senseless body of the poor man towards the shore. But\r\nHugh perceived Jack could not long hold out, and throwing off his\r\nclothes, he struck out to meet him, compelled him to relinquish the\r\ncharge of Wilkins; and thus they were all enabled at length to reach the\r\nshore. But all were greatly exhausted, and Wilkins was apparently dead\r\nwhen they drew him on the beach.\r\n\r\nO'Brien hastened through the woods, and by cries and signals brought\r\nMargaret and Jenny to their assistance, by whose prudent care and\r\napplications the poor man was restored to consciousness. No sooner was\r\nhe recovered, than, trembling excessively, he looked wildly round, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord! it is a terrible thing to die in one's sins!\"\r\n\r\n\"How glad I am to hear you say these words, Wilkins!\" said Margaret;\r\n\"and now let all our words and thoughts be thanks to Him who has given\r\nyou time to turn from these sins, and lead a new life. Pray to Him\r\nopenly. We are all your friends, and we will join you;\" and kneeling\r\ndown by the side of the convict, Margaret offered up a simple and short\r\nthanksgiving for the two men happily rescued from death, and a prayer\r\nfor continued mercy for their souls. For the first time the lips of\r\nWilkins moved in prayer, and he audibly uttered \"Amen.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to remove the anxiety of Mr. Mayburn, they returned to the\r\nencampment as soon as the exhausted swimmers were able to walk. Then\r\nArthur related to his friends that as soon as they had got the boat into\r\ndeep water, they suspected there was something wrong about her, and were\r\nendeavoring to make to shore, when she whirled round and was swamped in\r\na moment, and the labor of weeks and the hopes of escape were at once\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe whole party were greatly dejected; but Jack, who was at first deeply\r\nmortified, was the first to shake off his chagrin, and to declare boldly\r\nthat he would make another experiment. \"We have plenty of materials\r\nquite handy,\" said he; \"and it cannot be so far to the coast of the main\r\nland. If you will let me try again, sir, I feel quite certain I could\r\nmake two bark canoes that would take us all, and, if we were once\r\nfairly over the reefs, could be paddled across without danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good boy,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"I am but an indifferent judge of\r\nnautical affairs; but you must allow your first adventure has been\r\nsignally discouraging. Nevertheless, I admire that perseverance which\r\nmust in the end subdue obstacles and command success, and I do not\r\nobject to your continuing your experiments; but I would advise you to\r\ntry your next boat on the lake, where, in case of accidents, no fatal\r\nconsequences need be feared.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will make a canoe at once,\" answered he; \"but I will risk no lives. I\r\nwill paddle it across to the mainland myself, and then return to\r\nconvince you of its security. This time I have no fears, provided we do\r\nnot overload our vessels. I will set out to seek a tree immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will eat your dinner first, my man,\" said nurse; \"and if you had a\r\nbit of sleep after your swimming, before you set off to cut down trees,\r\nthere would be more sense in it. Here's some good roast duck for you; a\r\ngrand dinner it might have been if we had only had sage and onions.\"\r\n\r\nJack found Jenny was right. He was not equal to a long walk after his\r\nexertions and vexations; so he sat down to eat his roast duck, and then\r\nset about making models of canoes, prahus, and catamarans, from the\r\nrecollection of what he had seen or read of. But next morning, leaving\r\nWilkins, who was much bruised, and still weak, and subdued by mental and\r\nbodily suffering, in the care of Margaret and her father, the young men\r\nset out to explore the island for a tree of proper height and girth to\r\nmake use of for their first attempt at a canoe.\r\n\r\n\"After all, Mr. Arthur,\" said Jack, \"if this should fail, we could try\r\ncatamarans. That would be easy enough, and we have mangroves close at\r\nhand that would answer exactly for making them. But then I have my\r\ndoubts if the master, or Miss Margaret, could be brought round to trust\r\nthemselves on such bits of floats for a voyage that far. Here's a grand\r\ntree! Now, if we can only peel it clean, it will set us up.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a tall fine tree of the _Eucalyptus_ or gum species, with a thick\r\nrough bark, which seemed as if it might be easily removed. Arthur began\r\nby making a deep incision round the trunk at the bottom, and also in a\r\nperpendicular line as high as he could reach. By standing on a fragment\r\nof rock, he was able to carry it up to the height of twelve feet, and to\r\nfinish it by another circular incision. Hugh and Gerald stood at the\r\nfoot of the tree to receive the bark, which, when gently raised from the\r\ntrunk, was easily separated, and let down in one piece without any\r\ninjury, to the great delight of the boys. Jack was anxious to have it\r\ntransported to the cove immediately; but the boys wished to take a peep\r\nat their first landing-place before their return, and they all turned\r\ntheir steps in that direction. Hugh and Gerald had distanced the two\r\nelder youths, who had not reached the cliffs, when they saw the two boys\r\nreturning in haste, with dismay on their faces.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Arthur,\" cried Gerald, \"such a vexation! We are in for a battle,\r\nand we have no arms! The savages are ready for us on the beach.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are not ready for them,\" replied Arthur, \"and must therefore\r\nkeep out of sight. Do you two hasten homewards with the bark, while Jack\r\nand I reconnoitre.\"\r\n\r\nThen cautiously creeping along to the edge of the cliffs, they looked\r\ndown on the narrow strand below, and saw a number of the dark natives\r\ngathered round some object close to the water, which seemed to have\r\nexcited their curiosity. Jack, with a muttered exclamation of vexation,\r\nrecognized this to be his unfortunate boat which had doubtless drifted\r\non shore here.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Mr. Arthur,\" whispered the lad, in great agitation; \"as sure as you\r\nare living, I see that rogue, black Peter, that got all my tools, among\r\nthe savages; depend on it he has brought them here to seek for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"To seek for the remainder of our property, I suspect, Jack,\" replied\r\nArthur. \"They are probably not very anxious to encounter our fire-arms;\r\nand we should be no prize to them, even if they could capture us. But we\r\nhad best decamp now, as we are quite unarmed, and it might be dangerous\r\nto be detected; and, Jack, we must set to work directly. I am anxious\r\nnow to get away as soon as possible, for these fellows will be\r\nconstantly in our way on this small isle.\"\r\n\r\nThey withdrew with the same caution with which they had approached, and\r\nthen hurried to overtake the boys, who were moving slowly along,\r\ncarrying the bark; and with the additional hands they soon brought it\r\nsafely into harbor, to the admiration of Mr. Mayburn, who was, however,\r\ngreatly distressed to hear of another visit of the savages. Then, as\r\nthey measured and arranged the work, they discussed with wonder the\r\nappearance of black Peter among the natives, and the cause of his\r\ndisturbing their quiet seclusion.\r\n\r\n\"Peter's in his reet place amang 'om,\" said Wilkins, \"and it's time for\r\nus to be off when he shows his black, ugly face. As sure as we're here,\r\nmaster, if he cannot 'tice me off to join his crew, and start\r\nbush-ranging, he'll take my life. He's a reg'lar black-hearted un for a\r\nbit of vengeance.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, surely, Wilkins,\" said Margaret, \"there can be no fear that you,\r\nwho have now learnt to know good from evil--you, who have seen the\r\nwickedness of your past life, should ever go back to such sin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, ye see, miss,\" answered the man, \"it's little that such as ye\r\nknow, what a queer tempting a chap feels for a free, roving life. Why!\r\nhalf of our biggest rogues _did_ know good from evil; and what of that?\r\nThey liked evil better nor good. I reckon there's a bad spirit as is\r\nalways tugging at a fellow's heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Wilkins,\" replied Mr. Mayburn. \"It is the power of the\r\nPrince of Darkness that you feel in your heart, dragging you to the pit\r\nof perdition. But if you pray to God, my poor man, he will send you\r\nstrength to resist the evil one.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins groaned, and his friends felt true pity for the unfortunate man,\r\nwho was sensible of his own weakness; and while all deeply regretted\r\nthat the infamous Peter had chosen to pursue them, they resolved\r\ncontinually to watch and pray for the complete reformation of Wilkins.\r\nNeither could the family feel in safety while they believed the savages\r\nremained on the island; it was therefore arranged that Arthur and\r\nJack--the most prudent heads--should return to the cliffs above the\r\nlanding-place of these unpleasant visitors, to watch their proceedings,\r\nand endeavor, if possible, to discover their plans, and the motives that\r\nbrought them to the island.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the other boys transferred the bark to the capacious\r\ncave; the tent was also stowed there, with every other trace of their\r\nhabitation; and it was arranged that, if there was likely to be any\r\ndanger of detection, the two sentinels were to announce it by a sharp\r\nwhistle, when the whole family would be ready to take shelter in the\r\ngloomy but secure fortress.\r\n\r\nConcealing themselves as much as possible among the tangled mangroves,\r\nArthur and Jack went round to the spot from whence they had previously\r\nseen the strangers, and beneath the abundance of brushwood above the\r\ncliffs they made for themselves a complete hiding-place, with loopholes\r\nfor observation. They saw the men still assembled round the boat, but\r\nthe sound of the hammer induced them to conclude that Peter was engaged\r\nrepairing some damage in it; and, to the great vexation of Jack, he saw\r\nhis own tool-chest, which he valued so highly, standing on one side, and\r\nat a little distance lay the boughs of a large mangrove tree, and the\r\naxe with which they had been felled.\r\n\r\nArthur suggested that Peter had brought these men to the island, hoping\r\nto find the remainder of their property, and bringing the tools to cut\r\ndown a tree and make a raft to carry away the spoils; for the light\r\ncanoes which were lying on the beach were only fit to contain one\r\nperson, or, at the most, two in each; and that, finding the boat, Peter\r\nhad thought it more convenient than a raft for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think, Mr. Arthur,\" said Jack, \"they will be leaving any of the\r\ncanoes behind them? I should like to see how they finish them off at the\r\nends. But surely they'll never start off in that unlucky boat; I could\r\nhardly bide to see them enter her, knowing what we know.\"\r\n\r\nBut Arthur was of opinion that they were not called upon to risk their\r\nown lives and the lives of their friends, by going forward to report the\r\ncharacter of the boat. Besides, Peter, the only person who would be able\r\nto understand their language, would probably not believe them.\r\n\r\nSo they continued to watch till Peter had completed his work, and then,\r\nby the efforts of the natives, the boat was launched, the whole party\r\ncelebrating the event by dancing, singing, and flinging about their arms\r\nwith childish delight. Peter selected three of the men to accompany him\r\nin the boat, which, with the aid of some long poles and paddles from\r\ntheir canoes, they pushed off and forced over the rocks. The rest of the\r\nnatives leaped into their canoes, and followed with shouts of\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nIn deep anxiety the two young men continued to watch the boat, which\r\nthey expected every moment to see disappear; but whether Peter had found\r\nout its defects and remedied them, or the water had swelled the wood and\r\nrendered it fit for service, it was impossible to say. One thing only\r\nwas clear, that as long as they could observe it, till it had passed\r\ntowards the south, out of their view, it continued to move slowly, but\r\nwith apparent security.\r\n\r\nLeaving their position, they crossed over to a high point at the south\r\nof the island, from whence they could perceive the little fleet--the\r\ncanoes now diminished to mere specks--proceeding towards a dark object,\r\nwhich they judged to be a distant island.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that the people had all departed, they descended to the beach\r\nto inspect the scene of their visit, Jack remaining for some time silent\r\nfrom the mortification of seeing the product of his labors appropriated\r\nso successfully by the unscrupulous Peter; and almost disappointed that\r\nhe had not witnessed the boat go down, as he expected. But when they\r\nreached the strand, he recovered his spirits at the sight of a canoe\r\nwhich they had not been able to carry off conveniently after manning the\r\nboat. It was not useful as a prize, for it would only contain one person\r\nin comfort; but he was able, as he wished, to examine the workmanship.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we carry it off, Mr. Arthur?\" he said. \"A fair exchange is no\r\nrobbery; and you know, sir, this is poor payment for my good boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we had better leave it, Jack,\" answered Arthur. \"The blacks\r\nwill certainly return for it; and when they find it removed, they will\r\nbe convinced that we are still concealed on the island. If we remain\r\nunsuspected, Peter will naturally conclude from the sight of the wrecked\r\nboat, that we are all drowned; and will then think no more about us. You\r\nsee the simple construction of the canoe, closed at the ends by the\r\nstringy bark, which we can easily procure; or better still, we can use\r\nhempen ropes, of which we have still some; and we must strengthen the\r\nbottom by an extra layer of bark, or by thin planks.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not badly put together,\" said Jack, with a critical air; \"but it\r\nwill be strange if a regular taught English carpenter cannot beat it.\r\nI'm not daunted, Mr. Arthur, after all my vexations. And here's\r\nsomething that pleases me better; and, say what you will, sir, this is\r\nmy own, and I'll take it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a small saw, which had been left beneath the lopped branches of\r\nthe mangrove; and Arthur, prudent as he was, not only agreed that Jack\r\nhad a perfect right to carry away his own property; but he thought he\r\nmight do it with safety; for, in the place where it was lying, it would\r\ncertainly be washed away by the next tide, if it was left behind; and,\r\ncharmed with their prize, they hastened home to report that the\r\nintruders had departed.\r\n\r\nHugh and Gerald were in a high state of indignation at the audacity of\r\nPeter in carrying off their boat; and Wilkins was furious, upbraiding\r\nJack for his professional unskilfulness; when a fellow like Black Peter\r\ncould make the boat fit to stand a voyage.\r\n\r\n\"We do not know yet how the voyage ended,\" said Margaret. \"It may be the\r\nboat has again foundered where help could not be had.\"\r\n\r\n\"God send it may!\" said Wilkins. Mr. Mayburn reproved the thoughtless\r\nman for the exclamation, telling him he ought rather to pray that the\r\nsinful man might be long spared, that he might have opportunity to\r\nrepent.\r\n\r\n\"Him repent!\" cried Wilkins; \"bless you, master, ye might as lief look\r\nto Miss here turning bush-ranger! It's not in him. He were just born for\r\nnought but to die a rascal, and that he'll do, and no mistake!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a mistake, rash man!\" replied Mr. Mayburn. \"God sent no man into\r\nthe world marked for perdition. There is ever a door open that the\r\nvilest may enter. Let us all pray that he may find that door; and if God\r\npermit me, I would gladly use my humble efforts to reclaim the wretched\r\nsinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all I can say is, sir,\" answered Wilkins, \"God send ye may never\r\nhave a chance. Ye're a deal ower good to be thrawn away in running\r\nefter such a rogue, and ten to one he'd twist yer neck if ye said a word\r\nto him.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins could not be convinced that there was any hope for Black Peter;\r\nand Margaret besought her father henceforth to talk to the ignorant man\r\nof his own peril, rather than of that of his worthless comrade; of whom\r\nhe was not yet in a frame of mind to tolerate the mention.\r\n\r\nThe bark canoe was now begun in earnest. It was twelve feet in length,\r\nand broad enough to admit two persons seated on the bottom, for benches\r\nthey did not venture to introduce. The ends were closed firmly with the\r\nstringy fibres of the tree named the \"stringy bark tree,\" as the tough\r\nfibres of this bark seemed more suitable for the purpose than the\r\nhemp-twisted ropes found in the ship.\r\n\r\nTen days completed the first canoe, and hardened the gum used to coat\r\nit. Paddles and oars were added, and then the workmen fondly looked upon\r\nit as a success, and Jack was sanguine in his expectation that in fair\r\nweather it must reach the mainland safely. But it was not large enough\r\nto contain the whole party, and a second visit to the interior was\r\nnecessary, and a second gum-tree was barked. At this visit, and on\r\nseveral occasions, the younger boys looked out on the coast for traces\r\nof the natives, but all continued so tranquil that they began to hope\r\nthey should not again be disturbed.\r\n\r\nBefore they began to make the second canoe they made a trial of the\r\nfirst, by carefully conveying it over the reefs, and launching it beyond\r\nthem. Wilkins offered to take it alone; but Jack chose to accompany him,\r\nthat he might note any imperfection and correct it. It floated\r\nbeautifully, was easily governed, and the workmen were full of pride and\r\nhope as they deposited their canoe in the cave, and turned to work at\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"If we can but succeed as well with the next,\" said Jack, \"we shall have\r\nnothing to dread but a gale, or too heavy a loading. Let us consider,\r\nMr. Arthur; we shall be four in the first boat, and five in the second.\r\nFive will be too many for it, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my clothes,\" said Margaret, \"the gun, knives, and axe, with all our\r\ntable utensils, besides necessary provisions. How are they to be\r\nstowed?\"\r\n\r\nAll were silent; for to stow all these things besides the four\r\npassengers, would be more dangerous than even the fifth person.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Jack, my lad,\" said Wilkins, \"ye'll have to rig up a catamaran,\r\nlike them they have down yonder, to land folks over a high surf. I'se\r\nsee and manage it myself, and then ye'll be shot of me. Ye ken I'se a\r\ngood-to-nought; and maybe I'd be bringing down a storm on ye all, like\r\nthat Jonah as master was reading on.\"\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Mayburn assured Wilkins God would not pour his vengeance on\r\nthem for protecting a man who had shown some hopes of amendment, the\r\nsuggestion of Wilkins was fully approved. A catamaran was obviously\r\ndesirable, and as soon as the second canoe was completed, they set to\r\nwork, lopped the stems of the mangrove, and lashed them together to form\r\nas large a raft as they required. This they surrounded with a frame of\r\nthin wood, and the catamaran was completed to the satisfaction of the\r\nworkmen, ready for the cargo to be tied to it. Gerald named it the\r\nluggage-van, and declared he would certainly take his passage on it.\r\n\r\nWhen all was finished, it became an object of consideration what might\r\nbe the nature of the coast they should land upon. They had read that\r\nmany parts of the west coast of Australia were mere deserts, arid and\r\nbarren, without food or water, and they knew not but they might be\r\ndriven on such an inhospitable shore. It was therefore advisable, before\r\nthey abandoned the plenty that now surrounded them, that they should\r\ncollect stores for possible contingencies. The brandy cask they had\r\nfound in the wreck was large; this, before they embarked, they proposed\r\nto fill with fresh water from the tank, the most important provision for\r\nthe voyage. And for the rest, one fine morning the whole party set out\r\nwith bags and baskets on a foraging expedition to obtain food to victual\r\ntheir fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThe Foray.--Young Potatoes.--More Intruders.--Ruth's Introduction to the\r\nSavages.--The Sailing of the Fleet.--The Desert Shore.--The Giant\r\nAnt-hill.--Once more at Sea.--A Storm, and the Loss of the Catamaran.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the lake, they found the margin crowded with the\r\nnests of aquatic birds, built among the reeds, and a dozen fine ducks\r\nwere soon taken. Ruth filled a large basket with eggs, and finally a\r\nquantity of fish was procured. With this ample provision they turned\r\nhomewards; but passing the plot they had sowed with potatoes on their\r\nfirst arrival at the cove, they were astonished to see how forward the\r\nplants were; and on digging they found young potatoes, of which they\r\ncarried away a small bag; but as they still had a large supply of those\r\nfound in the wreck, they left the greater part for the benefit of\r\nsucceeding visitors.\r\n\r\nWhen they came near the height above the beach, on which they had first\r\nseen the footsteps of the natives, Hugh and Gerald went to the cliff to\r\nlook over once more on the well-remembered spot, but started back\r\nimmediately, for, to their deep distress, they beheld a considerable\r\nnumber of naked savages, painted with white chalk in a most frightful\r\nmanner, dancing, singing, and throwing up their arms as if they were\r\nfrantic.\r\n\r\nThe boys made a signal of silence to the rest; but Ruth, who was\r\nalways, as Jenny said, in the wrong place, had followed the boys to the\r\ncliff, and, curious to know what they had seen below, she leaned forward\r\nto look down through an opening in the bush. O'Brien, alarmed lest she\r\nshould be seen darted forward to seize her arm and draw her back; but\r\nstartled by the action, and terrified by the scene below, she lost her\r\nbalance, and, encumbered with the heavy basket, tottered over the edge,\r\nrolled down the steep cliff through the crackling, thorny brushwood, and\r\nalighted amidst the strange wild crew on the beach.\r\n\r\nSpringing up and looking round, the distracted girl uttered a succession\r\nof shrill screams, and the natives, in equal terror and amazement, gazed\r\non the strange creature that had so suddenly descended amongst them. Her\r\nhair, which was very long, and of a fiery red color, was flying loose\r\nover her scarlet cloak, her wild eyes were starting from her head, and\r\nher pallid face was streaming with blood from the scratches she had\r\nreceived in her descent. For a moment the savages appeared paralyzed;\r\nthen, without looking round, they fled to their canoes; and the next\r\nminute were seen paddling with all speed from the shores haunted by such\r\na frightful spectre.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Jack, in great alarm about his sister, had descended to\r\nthe beach, and was immediately followed by the rest of the young men;\r\nand the distressed, woe-begone aspect of Ruth, who continued to sob and\r\ngroan even after her fears were subdued, made Gerald laugh heartily, in\r\nspite of the tragic consequences that might have ensued from the\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, girl,\" said Jack, kindly. \"Thank God you are not much\r\nworse; so what have you to cry about now?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the eggs, Jack,\" she sobbed out. \"What must I do? They're all\r\nbroken, and what will Jenny say to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that,\" answered he; \"take up your basket, and come away with\r\nme to the lake, where you can wash your face and fill your basket again,\r\nand make the best of a bad job.\"\r\n\r\nJack's practical philosophy consoled the weeping girl, who collected\r\nmore eggs, and soon recovered from the distress of her adventure. The\r\nboys found that the timid natives had left behind them in their fright\r\nspears, boomerangs, and some excellent cordage, twisted of the fibres of\r\nthe stringy bark tree. Wilkins would gladly have carried off these, and\r\nunwillingly relinquished them at the command of Mr. Mayburn. \"What\r\nmatters,\" said he, \"standing on ceremony with them there black fellows.\r\nWhy, they would niver ax your leave to snatch t' bite out of yer mouth!\"\r\nwhich observation drew down on Wilkins a rebuke from Mr. Mayburn, and an\r\nexposition of the law of honesty, as established by God and man.\r\n\r\nAll the property of the natives was therefore left untouched, and the\r\nfamily returned to their own quiet nook, now more anxious than ever to\r\nleave a place to which curiosity, or the desire to recover their\r\nweapons, might at any moment bring back the late undesirable visitors.\r\n\r\nEvery one was now busily employed: a small number of potatoes were again\r\nplanted, and the remainder of their store packed in sail-cloth bags. The\r\nducks and fish were cooked; the eggs of the wild-fowl, as well as a\r\nquantity which Ruth's poultry had produced, were boiled hard, and packed\r\nwith soft grass in a box. The water-cask was filled; and then all the\r\npackages and provisions were lashed securely to the raft, which they had\r\nfinished by a mast and sail made from some rent remains of canvas on the\r\nmasts of the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe large sail which had formed the tent cover was spread over the whole\r\nof the freightage and nailed down. Then the bottoms of the canoes were\r\nspread with fine grass for seats, and after a thanksgiving to God, who\r\nhad given them the power and the means to accomplish this important\r\nundertaking, the family lay down in the balmy, dry, spring air of that\r\ndelicious climate, to take their last night's rest on the friendly isle.\r\n\r\nThe first dawn of morning roused them to action. Spies were sent to the\r\nheights to ascertain that the coast was quiet; then the first canoe,\r\ncontaining Mr. Mayburn and Margaret, Arthur and Hugh, was launched, and\r\ncarried safely over the reefs. Jack and O'Brien, with Jenny and Ruth,\r\nfilled the second, and Wilkins followed, paddling the heavy raft.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not easy in my mind, Jack,\" said nurse, \"for Master Gerald is up to\r\nany mischief; and if he sets Ruth on, we'se all be drowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your eyes on her, Mrs. Wilson,\" answered Jack; \"and if she will\r\nnot sit still, we'll have her tied upon Wilkins's catamaran.\" O'Brien's\r\nlaughter at the idea of Ruth being stowed with the luggage, made the\r\npoor girl shed tears; but she was comforted with the care her chickens\r\nrequired, she having persisted in retaining the charge of her pets.\r\n\r\nFor an hour they labored steadily, without any rest, till a westerly\r\nbreeze got up, and Wilkins, to his great relief, was able to hoist his\r\nsail; for he had previously been crying out for a helping hand. Then the\r\ncatamaran floated briskly over the waves, which were, however, a little\r\nmore raised by the wind than was pleasant for the slender canoes. But\r\neven the most timid took courage when the long line of low coast became\r\nplainly visible. No threatening rocks or foaming breakers appeared to\r\ncreate terror; and all seemed so favorable to the voyage of the\r\nunskilled mariners, that they began to be fastidious in their choice of\r\na landing-place.\r\n\r\n\"Let us coast awhile, Arty,\" said Hugh, \"till we come to the mouth of a\r\nriver, which will insure us a fertile coast. There is no occasion for us\r\nto land on a desert.\"\r\n\r\n\"There would only be one danger in such a choice,\" replied Arthur,--\"The\r\nnatives may also prefer the fertile coast, and would be likely to oppose\r\nthe landing of intruders. I think I should prefer to land at first on an\r\nuninhabited spot. We could then examine the country, and determine our\r\nfuture course. It appears to me, as we draw nearer, and can observe the\r\nlow coast opposite to us, that the landing would suit our canoes. What\r\ndo you say, papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are right, Arthur,\" answered he. \"I see trees above the\r\nbeach; and surely I distinguish large birds on the shore, a still more\r\nencouraging prospect.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret looked intently for some time in silence; then, turning to her\r\nbrother, she said, \"Are those figures we see really birds, Arthur?\"\r\n\r\nArthur looked round once more towards the coast, and then, calling out\r\nto the other boats, \"South! south!\" he altered the direction of the\r\ncanoe, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"After all, papa, we must coast a few miles, at least; for those figures\r\nare the natives, who are, as I now see, armed with spears, and will\r\nprobably resist our landing, regarding us as foreign invaders. We must\r\nnot begin our pilgrimage by going to war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think Peter is with them?\" asked Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"I do not suspect that he is,\" said Arthur. \"I fancy Peter's associates\r\nwere islanders; but we must avoid all intercourse with the natives as\r\nlong as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"How glad I am, brother,\" said Margaret, \"that we are sailing south. How\r\nhappy we should all be if we could ever reach the dear Deverells.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sister,\" answered Arthur, laughing, \"you surely do not expect\r\nthat we can voyage along the whole coast of West Australia in these\r\nshells. If we ever purpose to meet the Deverells again, we must have\r\nstout vessels for the sea, and wagons and horses for the land journey;\r\nwhich could only be obtained by the influence of some powerful fairy in\r\nour present desolate position.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, Arthur,\" said his father, \"if God permits us to set our\r\nfeet on that continent in safety, my aim shall be to discover, if\r\npossible, the estate of that estimable young man; and to offer myself to\r\nundertake the church of his new colony. I now despair of ever reaching\r\nmy destination in India, and my heart and my wishes point to Daisy\r\nGrange.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of his children sparkled as they listened to the speculations\r\nof their father; though Arthur smiled and shook his head, and Margaret\r\nsighed, as they thought on the difficulties of so prodigious an attempt.\r\n\r\n\"Never despair, Meggie,\" said Hugh; \"we'll do it. We are all strong\r\nfellows, in sound health, and I flatter myself tolerably ingenious. I\r\nfeel full of resources, and Jack is a mine of wealth. If we succeed in\r\ncrossing the sea in these slender toy boats, I do not see why we should\r\nnot traverse the whole continent of Australia, with our stout frames and\r\nbold hearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"it would be the realization of a\r\nlong-indulged dream to set my foot in a new and lovely world,\r\n\r\n    'To slowly trace the forest's shady scene,\r\n    Where things that own not man's dominion dwell,\r\n    And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been.'\r\n\r\nYes, my children, I also believe that, by God's help, we may penetrate\r\nthe wilderness, and look on wonder hidden since the day of creation. I\r\nam content to encounter hardships. Let us go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, papa,\" answered Arthur, \"_c'est le premier pas qui coûte_; and\r\nthis first step we have yet to make--the step upon _terra firma_.\r\nMargaret thinks that must be very easy; but we poor mariners, who know\r\n'the dangers of the seas,' have some notion of the difficulties of\r\nlanding a bark canoe on an unknown coast, without rudder, lead, anchor,\r\nor any nautical appliance; and not one amongst us, as you know, papa,\r\nfar advanced in the study of the grand science of navigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is wholly my fault, my boys,\" answered Mr. Mayburn. \"I ought to\r\nhave arranged that the charming science of navigation should form one of\r\nyour mathematical recreations; but I never dreamed that you would be\r\ncalled upon to make use of a branch of knowledge so rarely cultivated in\r\nthe quiet life of retirement to which we were called. But are we not\r\nsome miles from those threatening savages now, Arthur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite far enough, sir,\" said Arthur. \"They may have watched, and\r\nintend to follow us. We will put a dozen miles between us before we make\r\nfor the shore. But I see poor Wilkins is quite worn out, and, as his\r\nsail is useless now, I must spare you to help him, Hugh, and papa will\r\ntake an oar.\"\r\n\r\nThey approached near enough to mark the variations of the coast, now\r\nflat and sandy, then rugged, and occasionally bristling with rocks,\r\nwhich would have torn their little bark to shivers if they had\r\nencountered them. At last every arm was exhausted, and the opposite\r\ncoast being low and untenanted, they rowed up to it with caution, looked\r\nkeenly round for reefs and hidden rocks, of which they were in great\r\ndread.\r\n\r\n\"Let us run in first,\" shouted Wilkins from his raft. \"We can bide a\r\nshock better nor ye, and likely we may help ye out of yer troubles a\r\nbit, when we've gotten this ugly craft landed.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret felt some alarm for Hugh; but Arthur reminded her that Wilkins\r\nwas, in fact, the only sailor amongst them; besides, rough as he was, he\r\nwas too much attached to the boy to lead him into any danger. So the\r\ncanoes lay to, watching the clumsy catamaran paddled into shallow water.\r\nThen they saw Wilkins wade to shore, towing in his raft with a rope,\r\ntill at length, by the aid of Hugh, it was safely drawn on a low, broad,\r\nsandy beach.\r\n\r\nWilkins then hailed Arthur, pointed out the mode of bringing in the\r\ncanoes; and wading out breast-high in the water to assist him, finally\r\nall were happily landed.\r\n\r\n\"There's an ugly sand-bank just out yonder,\" said Wilkins, \"and I were\r\nfeared ye might run atop on it. Now ye niver thought, master, these bits\r\nof cockle-shells should turn out grand sailers as they are. I say, Jack,\r\nman, ye'll try a three-decker next, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins was in high good-humor, tired as he was, with his successful\r\nvoyage; and declared Hugh was a clever little chap, and he liked him\r\nbetter than any other lad he had ever seen. And now Margaret saw, with a\r\nhopeful heart, that the man was really changed; his rough and lowering\r\ncountenance began to look brighter; and the desperate convict was thus\r\nprovidentially led into the path of reformation.\r\n\r\n\"Now that we are really landed,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"I would ask what we\r\nare to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should answer, papa,\" said Hugh, \"let us eat, and rest; for you have\r\nno idea how tired and hungry Wilkins and I are.\"\r\n\r\nAll declared the suggestion was excellent, and while the provisions were\r\ngot from the catamaran, Arthur walked a little way from the beach to\r\ninspect the country, and saw before him only a wide bare plain, skirted\r\ntowards the sea by a few mangroves, and apparently devoid of all\r\ninhabitants, rational or brute. This was not a promising prospect; all\r\nthat could be said of it was, that it was quiet; though they were\r\ndreadfully annoyed by the mosquitos when they sat down to dinner\r\nunder the shade afforded by the mangroves.\r\n\r\nAs they ate their wild duck, they seriously discussed the future. They\r\nwere reluctant to set out over the plains and abandon their little\r\nfleet, lest circumstances should render it necessary to resume their\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\n\"What say you, Hugh, my boy,\" said Gerald, \"if you and I were to take a\r\nrun across these downs, and look out for a pleasant place for an\r\nencampment, out of the way of these rascally stinging beasts?\"\r\n\r\n\"What say you, Arthur,\" asked Hugh, \"will your excellency permit two of\r\nyour humble servants to set out on an exploring expedition?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be more prudent for his excellency to command the\r\nexpedition in person,\" said Arthur; \"I dare not trust you, my\r\nthoughtless lads, and we can leave a safe protection for the garrison in\r\nour two heroes, Jack and Wilkins; therefore let us march at once. Take\r\nthe gun out of its case, and give it into my charge; and you can carry\r\nthe spears and throwing-sticks.\"\r\n\r\nThe young men had completed, while in the island, a number of spears and\r\nthrowing-sticks, from the models of those left behind by the natives;\r\nthey had even successfully imitated the boomerang,--that mysterious\r\nweapon of warfare, so eccentric in its movements, and so remarkable in\r\nits effect; but they had not yet attained the art of casting it. Bows\r\nand arrows had been commenced, and these Jack undertook to employ\r\nhimself in completing during their absence.\r\n\r\nThough Arthur was a prudent and safe protector for his young brothers,\r\nand Wilkins and Jack were powerful defenders to leave behind, the family\r\ndid not separate without considerable anxiety. The young men crossed\r\nthe plains directly from the beach, satisfied that they were in safety\r\non that vast open waste, on which not even a growth of brushwood offered\r\nconcealment for a foe. A loose, sandy soil, covered with thin, brown\r\ngrass, gave to these sterile downs the appearance of a perfect desert.\r\nTo crown all, they could not see in any direction the indication of\r\nwater; and, thankful that they had brought a supply of this precious\r\nnecessary of existence from the island that would last them for many\r\ndays, Arthur still felt every moment more convinced that it would be\r\nfolly to linger on this inhospitable coast, where, unfurnished with any\r\nmeans of hastening their progress to a more fertile region, they should\r\nbe in danger of perishing with famine.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to try the canoes again, Hugh,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"It would be all very good fun,\" said Gerald, \"if it was not such hard\r\nwork. And it's little use hoisting a sail, for ten to one we shall have\r\na contrary wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think the odds are so great as that against a fair wind my\r\nboy,\" answered Arthur; \"but at all events hard work is better than hard\r\nfare. So we must just get such a night's rest as the mosquitos will\r\npermit us, and then try a bit of coasting in the morning. We can hardly\r\ncome on a more cheerless coast than this.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the world is that before us, Arthur?\" exclaimed Hugh. \"This\r\ncoast must be inhabited, for this erection is certainly the work of\r\nman's hand. It is one of the pyramids of Egypt in miniature.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Hugh, man's hand has never meddled with this structure,\" replied\r\nArthur. \"I recognize it from description as one of the marvels of\r\ninsect industry--an ant-hill. Observe the skill and ingenuity that must\r\nhave been displayed to construct this huge abode for a countless nation.\r\nThis firm yellow clay is now so hardened that without some tools we\r\ncould scarcely overthrow it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no entrance,\" said Hugh, \"is it possible that it is inhabited?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, close to the ground,\" answered Arthur, \"at this tiny speck\r\nof an aperture, from which I have just seen a diminutive insect emerge!\r\nand it has been remarked, that these creatures, the smallest of their\r\nspecies, erect themselves the most lofty abodes. This must be eight feet\r\nin height, and wonderful as it appears externally as the work of that\r\nminute creature, the interior, we read, is still more astonishing--a\r\nmiracle of perfection in art.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us open it, Arthur, and have a peep at the curious little nation,\"\r\nsaid Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"And thus destroy the labor of thousands!\" answered Arthur. \"No, Gerald,\r\nyou would surely never wish to be so wantonly destructive. We had better\r\nremember the advice of Solomon, 'Consider its ways, and be wise.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Margaret will laugh at our exploits as foragers,\" said Hugh. \"We have\r\ncertainly seen an ant-hill, but we have not even found an egg to carry\r\nhome. I wish we could pick up any token of life or vegetation in this\r\ndesert. Let us make a little tour, Arthur. I have my eye on our\r\nland-mark, that tall, bare, spectral mangrove.\"\r\n\r\nArthur did not object to walk a short distance towards the south,\r\nanxious to obtain a more extensive view of the coast; but they went\r\nover the bare, uninteresting soil for two hours without any\r\nsatisfaction. A single dry, withered acacia spread its thin branches\r\nbefore them; and Arthur was glad to climb it to extend his view along\r\nthe coast line. But all appeared desolation: not a hill, a rock, or a\r\ngreen fringe to denote vegetation or water. He descended, much\r\ndisappointed, and silently and thoughtfully they directed their steps to\r\nthe boats.\r\n\r\nIt was night before they reached their anxious friends, who saw in their\r\njaded and melancholy countenances the disappointment of their hopes.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell ye all along,\" grumbled Wilkins, \"as how north were yer\r\npoint, and ye'll have to make a north course, after all. I've run along\r\nthis here coast long afore this, and I say again, ye'll find neither\r\nmeat nor water for hundreds of miles down south.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must allow, Wilkins,\" answered Arthur, \"that voyagers have ever\r\nstated that this coast from the eighteenth to the twenty-fifth degree of\r\nlatitude is certainly desert; and that in the lower latitudes it is\r\nfertile and well watered; but by returning north we are flying from the\r\naim of our hopes, and must necessarily risk encounters with the\r\nnatives.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret sighed as she thought of removing still further from the\r\nDeverells, and Wilkins said,--\r\n\r\n\"Never ye heed them black fellows; they're nought but a set of reet down\r\ncowards, to be fled away by that silly bit lass. We're six clever chaps\r\nagain 'em, and if we bully a bit at first, we'se drive 'em afore us like\r\nsheep.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn shook his head, and Arthur had some doubts of such an easy\r\nvictory; but it was expedient to keep up the spirit of the party, and\r\nhe made no answer. Then, mortifying as it was to retrace their course,\r\nit was finally agreed they should sail north next morning, keeping in\r\nsight of the coast, and avoiding the landing-place where they had seen\r\nthe natives the previous day. They proposed to seek the mouth of a\r\nriver, if they could possibly discover one, which might form an easy\r\nmode of access to the interior.\r\n\r\nJack had during the day carefully examined the canoes, added a fresh\r\ncoating of the gum, which he had brought with him, and lashed the\r\ntimbers of the raft tight and firm. Then, after an uneasy night of\r\nvexatious contentions with the mosquitos, they breakfasted, prayed for\r\nGod's blessing on their perilous enterprise, and once more committed\r\nthemselves to the ocean.\r\n\r\nSince they first landed on their little island, the weather had\r\ncontinued to be invariably calm and beautiful, and even the thoughtless\r\nRuth and the rude convict seemed to be struck with the \"witchery of the\r\nclear blue sky,\" while the more intelligent did not forget to thank\r\ntheir bounteous Creator, who had tempered their little trials with this\r\nblessing. Now, cheered by the bright sky and the fresh sea breeze, the\r\nyoung rowers plied their oars with willing hands, singing merrily as\r\nthey urged their fragile barks over the light curling waves.\r\n\r\nHugh had joined Wilkins, as on the previous day, and, favored by a south\r\nwind they spread the sail. Wilkins, however, augured no good of this\r\nfavorable breeze, declaring the south wind was always the fore-runner of\r\na storm; but they might as well make the best of a bad job, by easing\r\ntheir arms a bit. But for many hours they sailed on favorably and\r\nuninterruptedly, for Margaret had taken care that each canoe should be\r\namply provisioned for the day. When they passed that part of the coast\r\nwhere the natives had been assembled on the previous day, they saw that\r\nit was now untenanted; but they felt no inclination to visit a locality\r\nso frequented, so continued their voyage; and on passing a hilly shore\r\nabout a mile further north, they not only saw the people collected in\r\nnumbers and waving their spears, but could hear their yells as they\r\nventured to approach within a mile of the shore.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Wilkins, my man,\" said Hugh. \"Do you fancy our little troop\r\ncould drive all that lot of fellows before us like a flock of sheep? I\r\nshould hardly like to make the experiment, unless each of us was armed\r\nwith a good rifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what we want, Master Hugh,\" replied Wilkins. \"It were just\r\nthat there gun, as I grudged that rogue Peter a vast deal more nor bags\r\nof bread and such like. If we'd had a few more guns, we might have\r\ndefied every black fellow alive atween here and Perth. They've not that\r\nsense to make out what it is, as makes all that clatter and smoke; and\r\nit's just because they ken nought about it as makes 'em so soft.... But,\r\nhalloo! Master Hugh, I don't half like yon sky, we'se have some weather\r\nafore long.\"\r\n\r\nHugh hailed the canoes, to announce to Arthur the meteorological\r\nobservations of Wilkins; and as the man had certainly more experience\r\nthan any of the party, they could not help feeling a little alarmed.\r\nArthur looked anxiously towards the coast for a favorable landing-place,\r\nbut here, only high bare cliffs ran along the shore, against which the\r\nwaves dashed with a fury that warned them they must not approach near.\r\n\r\nGradually, the sky grew dark with clouds, the wind was heard before it\r\nwas felt; and before Hugh and Wilkins could tear down their rude sail,\r\nthe raft was whirled round, and hurried furiously past the canoes\r\ntowards a sort of eddy which was dashing and foaming not a quarter of a\r\nmile before them. With all the speed they could make, Arthur and his\r\nfather rowed forward to rescue Hugh and Wilkins, regardless, at that\r\nmoment, of the fate of the raft itself.\r\n\r\nThe two men had now got the sail lowered; the raft was dashed amongst\r\nthe breakers, but Arthur's canoe gained on them, and he could hear\r\nWilkins hailing them, \"Keep clear of the eddy; and send us a rope.\"\r\nFortunately the mooring rope was still attached to the canoe, and Arthur\r\nendeavored, though many times ineffectually, to fling it within reach of\r\nthe doomed catamaran.\r\n\r\nAt length Wilkins secured the rope, and binding it firmly round Hugh, he\r\nflung the boy clear of the tossing raft. Arthur and the half-distracted\r\nfather hauled the rope gently, as long as the poor lad seemed able to\r\ncontend against the waves, and when he seemed to have yielded to their\r\nviolence, they drew him, senseless, to the canoe. The cares of Margaret\r\nsoon restored him, and in the mean time Wilkins had plunged into the\r\nboiling waves, and though a good swimmer, he with much difficulty\r\nreached the canoe, which they saw, with distress, was now far too much\r\nladen in such a sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA Total Wreck.--An Unknown Coast.--The Green Ants.--The White\r\nCockatoo.--Waifs.--The Gourd Tree.--The Fresh-water Rivulet.--A River\r\nVoyage Projected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The catamaran is lost, master,\" said Wilkins, as soon as he could\r\nspeak. \"But life afore property any day, and somehow I've had thoughts\r\nof late as how I'se hardly fit to die.... Now then; look about ye, young\r\nman. That there eddy's a _freshet_; there's a river comes in there, and\r\nthat's where as we should be, if we can make land cannily. Here, auld\r\nmaster, lend me them oars, and sit ye down and look after that young\r\nchap.\"\r\n\r\nArthur agreed with Wilkins; but it was a perilous undertaking to carry\r\nthe canoes over the foaming breakers, the hidden rocks of that frowning\r\ncoast. His own experience rendered him hopeless of ever accomplishing\r\nthe task, and he was now thankful for the advice and assistance of\r\nWilkins.\r\n\r\n\"Then we must tow them in the other canoe,\" said Arthur. \"Remember,\r\nWilkins, whether we be saved or lost, we must have them with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! ay!\" answered he. \"Let them fling us their tow-rope, and do you see\r\nto belay it cannily; and if we be swamped, look sharp and clutch Miss\r\nhere, and make a swim with her. We're nigh shallow water now, and we may\r\ndrive in, barrin' rocks.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only by clinging to each other, that Margaret and her father, as\r\nwell as the two women in the second canoe, were able to keep their\r\nseats, as the waves tossed up, whirled, and washed over their frail\r\nbarks. Sometimes they seemed to be thrown upon land, and the next wave\r\ncarried them back with it.\r\n\r\n\"Now then!\" cried Wilkins, holding up his oar, and signalling to Jack to\r\nfollow his example. \"Now, when we ground again, you, master, jump out\r\nand hold her hard for yer life.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment the canoe did ground with a shock, and Wilkins plunged\r\nthe oar into the sandy shore, and held his ground firmly till Arthur and\r\nMr. Mayburn leaped out of the canoe and held the prow; he followed their\r\nexample, and though still up to the waist in water, they grasped their\r\ncharge, standing close to each other, and bravely withstood the\r\nreturning wave. Then rapidly retreating to the shore, they easily drew\r\nafter them the lightened canoe, and placed it high and dry on the beach\r\nbefore the next wave overtook them.\r\n\r\nJack and O'Brien, though they at last happily reached the same haven,\r\nhad not escaped without mishap. The canoe had been capsized by the shock\r\nof grounding, and, but for the assistance of Wilkins, Ruth must have\r\nbeen lost. She was dragged out senseless, but still holding her basket\r\non her arm; and her first words on her recovery were loud lamentations\r\nat the discovery that two of her fowls were drowned.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the second canoe was whirling wildly among the\r\nbreakers, and Arthur called out that, if possible, it must be saved; and\r\nall hands were soon engaged in catching the towing-rope, by which they\r\nsoon succeeded in drawing the shattered bark to the beach.\r\n\r\n\"I think that is a useless labor, Arthur,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"for I\r\ntrust that none here may ever again be compelled to tempt the dangers of\r\nthe ocean in such a frail and imperfect bark. By God's mercy, our feet\r\nare once more upon the earth, the natural and ordained locality of man.\r\nByron, the wondrous poet who apostrophized the ocean, says:--\r\n\r\n    'His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields\r\n    Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise\r\n    And shake him from thee!'\r\n\r\n\"I feel, Arthur, that I am in my proper place, and desert or fruitful,\r\nlonely or populous, I would still remain on land.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you shall, dear papa, if God permits it,\" answered Arthur; \"but not\r\non this bare and comfortless strand. We must penetrate to a more\r\nhospitable region. It was to render this journey less toilsome to you\r\nthat I meditated to secure and fit up the canoes, in order to use them\r\nin ascending the river which we see pouring into the sea, and which must\r\nbe our guide to the interior.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said Wilkins, \"rivers is rivers in this queer, dry country; and\r\nother folks ken that as well as us; and when ye light on a sup of water,\r\nmake sure of finding a lot of them black fellows gathered round it. But\r\nthey're no better nor brute beasts, and we're a match for 'em any day.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to risk encountering them,\" said Arthur, \"for the sake of\r\nproviding ourselves with food, for I fear we are now reduced to absolute\r\ndestitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have Ruth's plump chickens,\" said the mischievous O'Brien.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Master Gerald!\" exclaimed Ruth, weeping; \"and could you have a\r\nheart to kill the poor dumb creatures as have lived wi' us so long? I\r\nwould hunger sooner nor eat a bit of one of them, not if we had fried\r\nham to it.\"\r\n\r\nThe volatile boy laughed heartily at Ruth's visionary fancy of chicken\r\nand ham; and Margaret assured the sorrowful girl that only the fear of\r\nstarvation should compel them to slay her pets, though the two drowned\r\nchickens must certainly be cooked, and not left on the beach for the\r\ngulls.\r\n\r\nThey had landed not far north of the mouth of what they now found to be\r\na considerable river, to the banks of which they soon made their way,\r\nand found that it ran between high cliffs, leaving a narrow pathway at\r\nthe side, almost impassable, with huge fragments of rock scattered along\r\nit. But they remained fixed in their intention of following up its\r\ncourse, as the safest guide in their expedition. But first they must\r\nrest, and have such refreshment as they could obtain, the provisions in\r\nthe canoes being washed out in the struggle to land. They sat down under\r\nan overhanging cliff, where curtains of drooping creeping plants\r\nshielded them from the sun, the boys having brought up stones for seats;\r\nand, after fervent thanks for their safety, they all felt a peace and\r\ntranquillity scarcely to be hoped for in their destitute condition.\r\n\r\n\"It was most fortunate that the rifle was with me in the canoe,\" said\r\nArthur, \"and safe in the case. It is no worse for the immersion. The\r\ncharges I always carry in my belt in the water-proof case; so we are\r\nprovided for defence. But the raft and its precious contents,\r\nMargaret!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have trust in God, my son,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"Look up at that\r\nmagnificent snow-white bird, one of the eagle tribe, which is even now\r\nsoaring over our heads. Why should we doubt? He who feeds the fowls of\r\nthe air will not forget his children on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are lots of oysters, papa,\" said Hugh, \"and Gerald has run after a\r\nlarge crab. There will certainly be turtles on the beach, and birds and\r\neggs in the cliffs, and then we have water in the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's not a kettle, nor a toasting-fork,\" said Ruth dejectedly.\r\n\r\n\"I'll provide you with both,\" answered the boy. Then from the roots of a\r\nmangrove, which spread below the cliffs, he tore down an enormous\r\nmussel, the shells of which were at least six inches in length, and,\r\ndrawing an arrow from his belt, he gave both to the girl, saying, \"Here,\r\nRuth, are your kettles and toasting-fork.\"\r\n\r\nA plentiful, but strangely cooked, repast was soon prepared, consisting\r\nof the limbs of the drowned chickens, toasted or broiled over a fire of\r\ndrift-wood, and served on oyster shells. Knives they had fortunately\r\npreserved, but nothing more, and they could not help feeling the want of\r\nthe common necessaries of social life.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the young men cleared the canoes from the accumulated weed\r\nand water, drew them under the shelter of the cliff, spread their\r\nboat-cloaks in them, and persuaded Margaret and their father to rest,\r\nwhile they held council what course to pursue next; but they found\r\nthemselves so overcome with fatigue and anxiety, that at the first\r\napproach of darkness they all sought rest under the canopy of heaven\r\nbefore they should commence their labors.\r\n\r\n\"Are all assembled?\" called Gerald, at the first gleam of daylight.\r\n\"Hugh and I have already been at the beach, and collected a hat-full of\r\nturtles' eggs and some wood for a fire. And now, Arthur, we are off on\r\nanother excursion; we want to climb the cliffs, to see what sort of\r\ncountry we have been thrown upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must accept me for a third in your enterprise,\" answered\r\nArthur, \"for papa would not approve of two such wild fellows setting out\r\nalone. Now, nurse, Hugh has made a fire to roast us some eggs, and with\r\na shell of cold water from that jar we saved in the canoe, we have our\r\nbreakfast complete.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you could but light on a few leaves of tea, Mr. Arthur,\" said Jenny,\r\n\"I could manage without milk and sugar; but I shall miss my drop of\r\ntea.\"\r\n\r\nArthur could give Jenny no hopes of any tea-leaves, or even of any\r\nsubstitute for that agreeable shrub, but he was sanguine about procuring\r\neggs, and even birds, for dinner. Then promising to return in an hour or\r\ntwo, and taking the gun with them, each of the hardy boys cut down a\r\nstrong stick, and then marched off along the narrow pathway at the foot\r\nof the high cliffs which enclosed the guiding river. After walking some\r\ndistance, the shelving rocks, covered with rich tropical creeping\r\nshrubs, appeared accessible, and they climbed to the summit, shaking\r\ndown upon them, as they forced their way through the bushes, multitudes\r\nof stinging green ants. Then they walked first to the edge of the cliffs\r\nthat overhung the sea, and looked round to observe their position.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that they were now upon the mainland, and that they had\r\nbeen driven into a wide bay, with headlands running out on each side,\r\nwhile the entrance was barred by coral reefs which it seemed miraculous\r\nthat they should have escaped. Beyond the reefs they distinguished\r\nshadowy dots, which they concluded were small islets, probably similar\r\nto that which had sheltered them so long, and which they now\r\ncongratulated themselves they had exchanged for a wider field and more\r\npromising prospect of reaching a permanent resting-place.\r\n\r\n\"How I wish papa was here,\" exclaimed Hugh. \"Do look at those curious\r\nbirds, and tell me what they are, Arthur. Oh, now I know they must be\r\ncockatoos, from their odd cry. Would it be right to kill them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have a shy at one,\" said Gerald, who had luckily brought his\r\nbow slung on his back; and he directly brought down with an arrow a fine\r\nlarge bird about eighteen inches in length, with snowy plumage and a\r\nbright orange crest.\r\n\r\n\"What will Margaret say?\" exclaimed Hugh. \"But it is a handsome\r\ncreature, and papa will be delighted to preserve it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must help to preserve us,\" replied Arthur, \"for we are in true need.\r\nWe must try to find some nests in the cliffs, and at least procure eggs\r\nto increase our rations; for a cockatoo, which has a large amount of\r\nfeather upon it, will be but a small dinner for nine hungry people.\"\r\n\r\nThey examined the crevices of the rocks, and found many nests of gulls\r\nand cockatoos, containing eggs and even tolerable-sized young birds, of\r\nwhich they brought away half a dozen, and filled their pockets with\r\neggs, and then turned from the coast to take a glance inland. The view\r\nbefore them was wild, and scattered over with rocks, but seemed well\r\nwooded; and from the curious mingled cries from the bushes, they judged\r\nthat the feathered tribes were abundant.\r\n\r\nThen they commenced their perplexing descent through the tangled bushes,\r\nshaking off, as they proceeded, the tormenting ants, which ran over them\r\nin countless numbers, each little creature seeming determined to make\r\nits presence felt.\r\n\r\n\"After our observations,\" said Arthur, \"I am still of opinion that, if\r\nthe canoes can be repaired, we must try to make them useful in ascending\r\nthe river, the banks of which promise to afford us abundant food; while\r\nthe waters supply us with their precious refreshment. We may encounter\r\nthe natives, certainly; but we shall be able to escape from them more\r\neasily in the canoes, than if we were dragging slowly on by land. We\r\nmust begin immediately to fit them for the voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw a fine gum-tree above,\" said Hugh, \"that will supply us with\r\nmaterials for mending or making. We must bring Jack here; but oh! Arty,\r\nI quite forgot--his tools would be all swept away with that unlucky\r\ncatamaran.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a most unfortunate loss,\" replied Arthur; \"but we must not\r\ndespair. If we have not the best means, we must take the next best; we\r\nmust consider and contrive, and not care for hard work.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned with their booty, and found Jack standing with a pensive\r\nand disturbed countenance over the canoes; while Wilkins and Margaret,\r\nthe tide being now low, had wandered down to the sea; where Gerald\r\nquickly followed them, and found that their object was to watch, in\r\nhopes that any part of the cargo of the catamaran might be thrown on the\r\nshore. Their first prize was a locker filled with potatoes, which Jack\r\nhad fortunately nailed up to prevent the water coming in, and thus the\r\ncontents were quite uninjured. But they found a greater treasure still,\r\nin the estimation of Margaret; a portmanteau of linen, which the thief\r\nPeter had either overlooked or despised, and which had been one of the\r\ngreatest comforts left them in their bereaved condition. They were\r\nfortunately all wearing good stout boots, and their outer clothing, in\r\nthat charming climate, was of minor importance.\r\n\r\nThe waifs were speedily removed from the beach to the encampment, where\r\nthey found Jenny and Ruth in great distress.\r\n\r\n\"This is worse than all, Miss Marget,\" said nurse. \"With that bright\r\nbonnie river running in sight of us, we have not a sup of water fit for\r\na Christian to drink. It's as salt as pickle; enough to poison one, and\r\ncan sarve for nothing that I can think on, but just to boil fish in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had not considered, Arthur,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"till nurse made her\r\nexperiment, that the tide naturally rises up the river, probably for\r\nmany miles, thus cutting us off from one of the most important\r\nnecessaries of life. Now, perilous as it may be to leave the coast, it\r\nis imperative on us to move, or we must perish.\"\r\n\r\nArthur reflected for a few minutes, and then said, \"Let us have some\r\neggs, Meggie; then Jack will accompany us, and we will set out to trace\r\nthe river up the ravine; and I cannot but think we shall certainly meet\r\nwith tributary streams from the hills, of perfectly fresh water.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how shall we bring back the supplies to the camp?\" asked Hugh. \"We\r\nhave no vessels except mussel-shells, or our cups.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, warra!\" exclaimed Gerald, \"if the sea would only be civil enough to\r\ngive us back our water-cask! Could we not go out to the reefs, Arthur,\r\nand look for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was too heavy to be easily thrown on shore,\" answered Arthur. \"It is\r\nmost likely fixed in some sand-bank, whence it will require a storm to\r\nmove it. We must each choose one of the largest of the mussels we saw\r\nthis morning clinging to the banks, and bring them in filled with fresh\r\nwater--provided we meet with the water--carrying it as steadily as we\r\nare able. If we only had the canoes in working condition, we would move\r\nat once above the influence of the tide. Can we possibly repair them,\r\nJack? We can procure bark and gum.\"\r\n\r\nJack turned out the contents of his pockets--neatly tied knots of small\r\ncords, a clasp knife, a hammer, and about a pint of nails.\r\n\r\n\"I always have a hammer and a few nails about me, you see, Mr. Arthur,\"\r\nsaid he, \"and if I had but an axe and a saw, I'd not fear any work. But\r\nit's a sin to be drowned; something will be sure to turn up; so with\r\nGod's help we'll manage these bits of boats, and then, thank God, Master\r\nO'Brien saved his bow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And here you see the remains of mine, Jack,\" said Hugh. \"I have picked\r\nit up on the beach. You must try and fit me out again, and then neither\r\nstorm nor savage shall tear it from me. Only think, papa, if I had had\r\nmy bow, we might have brought down a splendid white-headed hawk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that you had succeeded, my boy,\" answered his father. \"A\r\nwhite-headed hawk would indeed have been a gem in my collection, an\r\nanomaly in the known feathered race. But, indeed, every living creature\r\nin these regions is an anomaly to all naturalists. This cockatoo is\r\nobviously of an antipodean race. Its form, habits, and peculiar notes,\r\nmark it to be of a distinct and modern family, having even little\r\nrelation to the _psittacidæ_ of the ancient race. I am pleased with this\r\nremarkable bird, my dear boys, and feel no inclination to have it cooked\r\nand eaten like a common barn-door fowl.\"\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said Margaret, \"I should feel less remorse in devouring\r\nthis stranger than one of our old familiar friends, Ruth's beloved\r\npets.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a common outcry against this household homicide, or gallicide,\r\nas Hugh called it; but there were young birds and eggs sufficient for\r\nthe day's provision; so the cockatoo was reprieved, and Mr. Mayburn\r\ncarefully preserved the bird in all the glories of its white plumage and\r\nyellow crest, so curiously movable at the will of the bird.\r\n\r\nOnce more the young men set out for the very important object of\r\ndiscovering fresh water; and the tide being down, they walked up the\r\nmargin of the river with less difficulty than in the morning, but it was\r\nnot till after they had gone two or three miles beneath the thickly\r\ncovered cliffs, which were perfectly alive with multitudes of strange\r\nbirds, that they came to a narrow ravine, opening at the north, from\r\nwhich a low cascade poured a clear but slender rill into the river.\r\n\r\nThey at once decided to ascend this branch stream. Its narrow bed was\r\nguarded by lofty rocks, which hid from their eyes every prospect but\r\nthat of the clear blue sky above them, and their voices sounded hollow\r\nas if from below the ground; but, to their great satisfaction, the water\r\nwas fresh, clear, and cool, and no sparkling champagne was ever enjoyed\r\nmore truly than the draughts they quaffed from the shells of the\r\nfresh-water mussels which were abundantly clustered on the banks and\r\nstrewed around.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you feel, Gerald,\" said Hugh, \"as if we were passing through some\r\ngloomy glen to arrive at a grand old Moorish castle--full of\r\nenchantments of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a capital idea, Hugh,\" answered he. \"Then there will be a\r\nbeautiful princess shut up in the steel tower, with a hideous black\r\nenchanter keeping guard over her, and a fiery red dragon at the gate,\r\nand we have to conquer him with one rifle and half a dozen cartridges,\r\nthat we may release the princess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you Irish blunderer,\" replied Hugh, \"whoever heard that either\r\ndragon or enchanter could be overcome by powder and shot? If you have\r\nnot fairy patronage, you must have valor and prudence, and resolution;\r\nand there's Arthur, though he looks so meek and quiet, would be the\r\nconquering hero.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will leave the siege of the enchanted castle for a more convenient\r\nopportunity,\" said Arthur, \"and be content to carry home such valuable\r\ntrophies of conquest as a few shells of fresh water. But why has Hugh\r\nclimbed that almost perpendicular cliff?\"\r\n\r\n\"He fancied he saw a palm-tree on the height,\" answered Gerald; \"but if\r\nit really be a palm, I must say it is an ugly tree; and, for my part, I\r\nwould much rather have found an apple-tree, only, as I suppose\r\nSeptember is spring in this antipodean world, the apples could not be\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, apples are not indigenous in Australia,\" said Arthur; \"nor\r\nshall we, I fear, meet with any equivalent fruit. Some of the palms are\r\nreally useful, but I cannot think what species of palm that can be.\"\r\n\r\nA voice was heard from above, commanding them to clear the way, and a\r\nhuge gourd was hurled down, rolling to the very edge of the stream. It\r\nwas plainly not fresh plucked, but must have lain long on the ground;\r\nand when Hugh descended, disappointed that he had not been able to find\r\nany fruit on the tree, Arthur explained that the gourds that were known\r\nwere not generally edible, but most useful as vessels for holding water.\r\nThen Jack cut a hole in the shell, which they cleansed from all the\r\ndecayed matter, and washed frequently to remove the bitter taste of the\r\ncontents. The gourd was slung by a cord, which Arthur himself placed\r\nover his shoulders, and filled with the fresh water for their friends.\r\n\r\nJack having found the _Eucalyptus_ or gum-tree that he required, they\r\nstripped it of the bark, and, having filled a mussel-shell with the\r\nfresh oozing gum, they returned to the encampment, well pleased with\r\ntheir successful, though very tedious expedition; for the flowing tide\r\nmade their return along the banks most difficult. In fact, Arthur was of\r\nopinion that if they waited for a spring tide, the river would entirely\r\nflood the ravine, and render their progress impossible except by boat.\r\n\r\n\"I was not aware,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"that the wide-spreading but\r\nfastidious genus _Cucurbita_ extended to these strange regions; yet\r\nthis gourd surely belongs to it I am curious to see the tree, to\r\nascertain if it is of any known species.\"\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" said Margaret, \"it will be very useful to us. Its\r\ncontents are truly precious, and we are most grateful to our persevering\r\nand active purveyors. And we welcome them heartily to their dinner of\r\nbroiled ducklings, or whatever else these delicate little birds may be\r\nnamed, with one potatoe for each person, which has been boiled with salt\r\nwater in a mussel-shell.\"\r\n\r\nThe potatoes were pronounced to be improved by their saline immersion,\r\nand the ducklings had no fault except youth and leanness. But oysters\r\nwere plentiful, and the report of the explorers announced abundance in\r\nthe regions up the river; so that it was with thankful hearts the family\r\nsought repose after their labors, to fit them for the renewed toil of\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nJack commenced his work at daylight. He fixed large patches of bark with\r\ngum over the weak or damaged part of the canoes, and left them to harden\r\nin the sun. Then, with immense labor, they cut down with their knives\r\nsome boughs for poles to propel the vessels. A single oar had been\r\nthrown ashore by the last tide, and some broken spars, from which a pair\r\nof short oars were rudely formed. Hugh and Gerald had been employed in\r\nthe mean time in the search for turtles' eggs, and had been fortunate\r\nenough to meet with a quantity, as well as with a small turtle. None of\r\nthe party had much taste for the rich food, but nothing eatable was to\r\nbe despised in their situation; so the turtle was sacrificed, and\r\nanother kettle provided for the cooks.\r\n\r\n\"The gum seems already hardened on the boats,\" said Arthur, \"and I do\r\nnot see, papa, that we have any temptation to remain on this\r\nmosquito-haunted coast longer than necessary. In another hour the tide\r\nwill be flowing up the river, and will assist our voyage greatly. Shall\r\nwe then at once set out on our important expedition?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see the necessity of it, my son,\" answered Mr. Mayburn, \"and am\r\nsatisfied. Let us implore a blessing on our undertaking, and then go\r\nforth, confiding in the protection of the Most High.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins attended the family devotions with decorum now; but what effect\r\nwas produced in his heart was yet to be developed. Hugh and Margaret, to\r\nwhom he listened more patiently than to the rest, were satisfied that\r\nsome change was taking place in the sinful man, and earnestly believed\r\nthat he would, by God's grace, be turned to the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nThe Voyage up the River.--The Way to China.--The Note of a Strange\r\nBird.--A Hasty Flight.--A Tropical Storm.--The Loss of the Canoes.--The\r\nCave of the Bats.--A Toilsome Pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the fervent heat of noon had somewhat subsided, the party arranged\r\nthemselves in the two canoes, and, aided by the tide, swept up the\r\nriver, which now extended to the cliffs on both sides, and effectually\r\ncut off any passage by land. Occasionally the fallen masses of the\r\nsandstone rocks, which lay shelving or sloping to the water, were\r\ncovered with a rich growth of low entangled shrubs, now bursting into\r\nflowers of many a brilliant hue; amongst which numbers of pert, noisy,\r\nlittle green or variegated parrots hopped about, chattering over these\r\nstrange disturbers of their wonted tranquillity.\r\n\r\n\"Charming! charming!\" exclaimed Mr. Mayburn. \"This is the sublime\r\nsolitude of which I have dreamed all my life. How glorious it would be\r\n\r\n    'To hold with Heaven communion meet,\r\n    Meet for a spirit bound to Heaven,--\r\n    And, in this wilderness beneath,\r\n    Pure zephyrs from above to breathe.'\r\n\r\nWhat a completion of all my hopes it would be, my children, if you could\r\nfind some quiet spot where we might land, and be content to pass our\r\nlives upon it.\"\r\n\r\nThis desire of Mr. Mayburn was received by his children with some\r\nconsternation, while Ruth, though she but vaguely understood the\r\nproposal, looked round at the prison-like rocky walls, the sombre\r\ntwilight, and the dashing waters, and began to cry. Even Wilkins, who\r\nheard all that was said in Mr. Mayburn's canoe, cried out, \"Nay, nay,\r\nmaster, that would upset all; I'se not flinch to sail wi' ye, or to\r\ntramp wi' ye; but to bide here for good, among oysters and poll-parrots,\r\nis what I can't stand. It would soon set me off bush-ranging.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must move onward, papa,\" said Arthur, \"but doubtless we shall find,\r\nas we proceed, scenes that will interest you even more than this. We may\r\neven encounter peaceful tribes; and though our ignorance of their\r\nlanguage will prevent our holding any beneficial intercourse with them,\r\nwe may at all events give them an example of kindness and forbearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And remember, papa,\" said Margaret, \"we have a definite aim in our\r\ntravels. We must look forward to the pleasure of joining our friends,\r\nthe Deverells.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Margaret,\" replied he, \"how can you hope that we shall ever be\r\nable to traverse the vast space that must separate us? How can you and I\r\npenetrate forests, climb mountains, or cross mighty rivers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Few of them last to signify, master,\" said Wilkins, \"by yer leave; and\r\nbetter for us if we had more. I kenned some of our chaps down yonder as\r\ntired of slavery, and what would serve 'em but be off to Chinee, which\r\nthey heared say lay to t' north; and reet glad were they to sneak back\r\nto hard work and full rations. Why, they'd gone miles and miles over dry\r\nsand, wi' niver a tree to shelter 'em or a sup of water to drink. Where\r\nrivers ought to have been, there were just dry mud and wet mud, and\r\nthat were all. We'se want no boats in them there rivers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, dear papa,\" said Arthur, \"do not look so much alarmed at\r\nWilkins's exaggerated reports. I have read the travels of scientific and\r\nexperienced explorers, who certainly agree that large portions of the\r\ncoast are desert, but give strong reasons for hope that the interior may\r\nbe fruitful and well-watered. To these fertile regions, I am of opinion,\r\nwe should endeavor to penetrate; for we have not means nor nautical\r\nskill to attempt a sea-voyage, even to the inhabited islands of the\r\nIndian Ocean. But it is for you to decide, papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"I leave it to you, my boy,\" answered his father. \"I rely on your energy\r\nand judgment, under Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we to turn up our watering-river?\" called Hugh, from the forward\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a niche in the rocks,\" answered Arthur, \"secure from the tide,\r\nwhere we will rest to-night, as we shall have our fresh water near at\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\nThe nook was as convenient as any roofless place could be for a night\r\nabode; and even Margaret had now become accustomed to this wild life,\r\nand rested her head on a pillow of rock, in the open air, with the peace\r\nand comfort of a tranquil and pious spirit.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning the boys went up the fresh-water rivulet to enjoy\r\nthe luxury of a bath; and such was the profusion of fish that filled the\r\nclear water, that they succeeded without difficulty in spearing two of\r\nthe large species of river-cod that they had found in the island lake;\r\nand as these weighed ten or twelve pounds each, they returned very\r\ntriumphant with their spoil.\r\n\r\n\"I know it has been familiarly named the river-cod,\" said Hugh; \"but you\r\nknow, papa, the cod is strictly a sea-fish; besides, this ugly fellow,\r\nif he were not so large, is not unlike a perch.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is like the productions of Australia,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"unclassed\r\nand strange. It seems to blend the distinctive features of the cod and\r\nthe perch,--the salt-water and fresh-water tribes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's safe to eat?\" asked Jenny, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"We have already tried it with impunity, nurse,\" answered Arthur; \"all\r\ntravellers praise it as delicate and nutritious, and, from its abundance\r\nin the rivers, it must be a great boon to the natives.\"\r\n\r\nThe fish was boiled in the salt-water. But before night they had rowed\r\nbeyond the influence of the tide; and had now to labor hard to ascend\r\nthe river, the high banks of which continued to be shaded by mangroves,\r\nwhich were weighed down with clusters of oysters and fresh-water\r\nmussels, looking like some strange fruits of this new country.\r\n\r\nThere was something so sublime and awe-inspiring in the novelty of the\r\nscenery, that the whole party long contemplated it in silence, till an\r\nexclamation from Ruth, about the \"bonnie ducks,\" roused them to observe\r\nthe flocks of wild-fowl; and Jenny thanked God that there could be no\r\nfamine here; while Mr. Mayburn noted with admiration the varieties of\r\nwater-fowl, beautiful and unknown, which sailed over the river or\r\nclamored noisily among the mangroves.\r\n\r\nThe labor of ascending the river in the heat of the day soon fatigued\r\nall the rowers, and they were thankful to seek refuge and rest in a\r\nnarrow ravine which ran out north, and which, after the rains, would be\r\na rivulet. At present, all that proved its existence were a few narrow\r\nchannels, with here and there a pool of clear water. The rapidly\r\nspringing tropical vegetation had already spread and matted itself in\r\nthe very bed of the river, forming a picturesque jungle, amidst the dark\r\nfoliage of which the tiny rills sparkled like diamonds. On each side\r\ntowered lofty cliffs, hung gracefully with luxuriant creepers, and a\r\nthick belt of tall gum-trees and wild nutmeg-trees, covered with greedy,\r\nnoisy parrots, ran along the base. Every thing was new and charming; and\r\nhaving drawn the canoes up in safety beneath the roots of a mangrove,\r\nthey wandered slowly up the ravine, to find, if possible, a grassy spot\r\non which to rest and eat their dinner. As they walked along, they found\r\non each side openings in the cliffs, smaller ravines or river-beds; all\r\nsimilar in rich vegetation, and all equally lonely. It was a perfect\r\nlabyrinth of nature; a scene of enchantment that filled the minds of the\r\neducated with admiration and holy thoughts, but shook the ignorant with\r\nall the tremor of supernatural terrors.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder much,\" said Margaret, \"that we should find these beautiful\r\nscenes unpeopled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll see people soon enough, Miss,\" said Wilkins. \"What would they do\r\nhere? Queer fellows as they be, they cannot perch atop of trees like\r\nthem howling poll-parrots, nor lie under water like oysters. Wait till\r\nwe come on a bit of bare common, and ye'll see folks enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilkins is right enough, Margaret,\" said Arthur, \"this lovely spot,\r\nhappily for the free inhabitants of the air and the water, is unfit for\r\nthe dwelling of man. I do not think it would be prudent to wander far\r\namong these bewildering ravines, our safest guide will be the broad\r\nriver; and as we cannot meet with a convenient dining-room here, I\r\npropose that we should return to eat our dinner under the mangroves, in\r\ndefiance of the troublesome inhabitants around us.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jenny contrived to smoke away the mosquitos with her cooking-fire,\r\nthough the green ants still contrived to annoy her by falling as garnish\r\non the beautiful fish which she served on a turtle's shell. The hungry\r\ngroup only laughed at the petty vexation, as they gathered round the\r\nfeast with oyster-shell plates and mussel-shell cups, to eat heartily,\r\nthough they wanted forks, spoons, and, as Jenny declared, all Christian\r\ncomforts.\r\n\r\nWith renewed vigor they resumed their oars, and pursued their voyage on\r\nthe pleasant highway, which the young and ardent believed would forward\r\nthem towards the distant home they hoped to reach. And when absolute\r\nfatigue compelled them to desist, they found a convenient landing-place\r\nfor the canoes on a broad patch of bare sand. They drew them on shore,\r\nand, to stretch their cramped legs, walked forward till they reached a\r\nspot where a slip of the rocks had formed a gradual ascent.\r\n\r\nThough encumbered with trees and brushwood, they were all desirous to\r\nattempt this ascent to search for nests and eggs, and, above all, to\r\nattain, if possible, the heights above, that they might survey the\r\ncountry through which they were passing. They found innumerable nests of\r\nducks, geese, and swans, and of a large bird which distracted Mr.\r\nMayburn by its resemblance to the pelican. They found also some\r\nwell-grown young birds, but contented themselves with carrying off a\r\ncouple of fine cygnets.\r\n\r\n\"Hark, Arthur!\" said Hugh; \"what a strange cry. It must be the note of\r\nsome new bird. Let us follow the sound, that we may obtain it, if\r\npossible, for papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bird, indeed!\" exclaimed Wilkins; \"fiddlestick! Ye'll bide where ye\r\nare, Master Hugh. Ye little ken what sort on a bird that is. Ye'd better\r\nkeep quiet, for them sort of birds is awkward customers. I reckon I ken\r\nthat 'Coo-ee! Coo-ee!' better nor either ye or t' auld master. It's\r\nnought else but them black fellows hailing one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear it is but too true, Hugh,\" said Arthur. \"I have heard of the\r\ncurious cry of the natives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us flee,\" said Mr. Mayburn, turning hastily back. \"Let us not seek\r\nscenes of discord and bloodshed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't I steal among the trees and get a peep at them?\" said O'Brien.\r\n\"The wood is so thick, they would never see me, and then I could let you\r\nknow what we had to fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have ye to be over sure,\" said Wilkins, \"that there's not\r\nhalf a hundred blackies skulking underneath this here scrub as we're\r\ntrailing through. They're cute rogues, and like enough, they've been\r\ntracking us all along. We'se be better looking after our boats, nor\r\nafter them. We'se see plenty on 'em afore long.\"\r\n\r\nIt was plainly prudent to retreat, wherever the unseen enemy might be;\r\nand having secured their boats beneath a spreading mangrove, they\r\nroasted and ate some eggs, and then discussed calmly the prospect of\r\nmeeting the natives, which now seemed inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"I have finished another bow,\" said Jack; \"we have arrows and spears,\r\nand a throwing-stick. And then Mr. Arthur has his rifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's worth all t' rest put together,\" replied Wilkins. \"They can beat\r\nus out and out with spears, and them queer crookt boomerangs; but give\r\n'em a shot, and they'll fly off like sparrows. We'll have to mind, for,\r\nye see, they'll never come on us boldly like men, but they'll sneak and\r\ncower, and spy, to see what we're made on. And I'd like to see t' auld\r\nmaster there keep up his heart; for if they see a fellow among us show a\r\nwhite feather, we're all done.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I should never think of carrying a white feather, Wilkins,\" said\r\nMr. Mayburn. \"I confess that I have harbored the thought of holding out\r\nto them a green branch, which, I have understood, ever signifies a flag\r\nof truce among savage nations.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fig for yer flags!\" cried Wilkins contemptuously. \"Show 'em a stout\r\nheart and a long rifle, and they'll understand 'em better nor a green\r\nflag. There goes the _Coo-ee_ again! Will you put out that fire, lass.\r\nIs there any sense in sending up a smoke to let 'em see where we are?\"\r\n\r\nRuth extinguished the fire, trembling with fright, and then crept close\r\nto Margaret and Jenny. As it was now quite dark, the women, as usual,\r\nlay down in the canoes, and the men watched and rested alternately till\r\ndaylight dispelled the fear of a nocturnal attack. Then, not liking\r\ntheir neighborhood, they launched the canoes again, resolving to\r\nbreakfast on a more secure spot; and after proceeding many miles up the\r\nriver, they disembarked on a flat rock that ran out from the cliffs,\r\nwhere they cooked eggs for their breakfast, and the cygnets to take with\r\nthem for the next meal.\r\n\r\nBut on embarking again, they found, with some uneasiness, that the\r\nnavigation of the river was becoming difficult. The breadth of the bed\r\ngradually contracted; the rocks on each side overhung the water, into\r\nwhich large blocks had fallen from above, among which the stream rushed\r\nin strong eddies, or poured over the masses in cascades; thus rendering\r\ntheir progress perilous, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, before they had observed any premonitory signs, a terrific\r\nstorm of thunder and lightning burst upon them, accompanied by a violent\r\nwind and a deluge of rain. The peals of thunder, repeated again and\r\nagain among the towering cliffs, were tremendous. Ruth shrieked with\r\nterror, and Margaret, with all her firmness, trembled to hear the voice\r\nof the tempest.\r\n\r\nThe little canoes, whirled round and dashed against the rocks, seemed\r\ndoomed to inevitable destruction. Wilkins, in this fearful emergency,\r\nsucceeded in securing a rope to one canoe, then leaping out upon a\r\nshelving rock, he held it till, with Hugh's assistance, the three women\r\nwere snatched out, one after another, to the rock, where they clung to\r\nthe trees to keep themselves from being swept away by the wind; but they\r\ntried in vain to save the canoe, as Wilkins had relinquished the rope to\r\nassist the women, and they were mortified to see it hurried down the\r\nimpetuous river beyond all hopes of recovery.\r\n\r\nThe river was already raised by the pouring rain, but Wilkins boldly\r\nplunged in with an oar, which he extended to the men in the second\r\ncanoe, and assisted them to reach the shore; but their boat, which had\r\nbeen previously damaged, was whirled against a rock, and went to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God no lives are lost,\" murmured Mr. Mayburn, as, exhausted and\r\ndrenched with rain, he crouched under the trees, the light foliage of\r\nwhich afforded very insufficient shelter from the torrents of rain which\r\ndescended on them; and for some time they were so stunned with their\r\nfears and their desolate condition, that they could not command their\r\nthoughts sufficiently to consider where they should turn to search for a\r\nbetter protection.\r\n\r\nAt length Arthur pointed out that a little higher up the river a slab of\r\nrock ran out and formed a sort of canopy over the narrow hem of beach\r\nbeneath. Thither, therefore, the distressed party removed, and they\r\nfound even a more convenient shelter than they had hoped; for the hollow\r\nbeneath the slab was raised about four feet from the ground, and\r\nextended backwards into the sandstone rock, forming a cavern impervious\r\nto wind and rain. Their entrance dislodged hundreds of bats, of strange\r\nand frightful forms, and Mr. Mayburn half forgot his fears and miseries\r\nwhile he looked with admiration on a huge, imp-like creature, which he\r\nasserted must be the animal distinguished by travellers as the \"flying\r\nfox.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these hideous inhabitants were dispersed, Margaret and the two\r\ndistressed women gladly took possession of this gloomy retreat, which\r\nwas dry and secure. Piles of dead wood lay scattered round it, which\r\nenabled them to make a fire and dry their dripping garments. To their\r\ngreat joy, they had been able to preserve their bows, spears, and rifle,\r\nand Ruth had grasped firmly her precious basket of chickens. At the\r\nmoment when the danger was imminent, Wilkins had had presence of mind to\r\nthrow on shore the locker of potatoes, and also the portmanteau, from\r\nwhich they all were now glad to procure changes of clothes. The cooked\r\nprovisions were lost; but they roasted some potatoes, and enjoyed their\r\nsimple repast, while the thunder rolled loudly over their heads, and the\r\nrain poured like a deluge into the swollen river.\r\n\r\n\"We can go no farther to-day,\" said Hugh, looking out with a melancholy\r\nair. \"What can we do, Gerald?\"\r\n\r\nJack was already at work in a retired nook, making arrows from the\r\nbamboos which were plentifully scattered round; and, roused by his\r\nexample, the boys joined him to sharpen spears and shape bows, which\r\nwere to be completed when they met with gum to cement them, and stringy\r\nbark to form the bowstrings. Arthur cleaned his valuable rifle, Margaret\r\nwove some reeds into a basket for eggs, Mr. Mayburn lectured; Wilkins\r\nalone seemed weary and out of his element, his good properties only came\r\nout when roused to action by difficulties, and as Margaret watched him\r\nlazily rolling a piece of bark for a cigar, and then lying down to smoke\r\nit, she longed for some settled habitation, that this unfortunate man,\r\nnow but half reclaimed, might have useful occupation and acquire regular\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nBut even the most industrious of the party could not but find that wild,\r\nstormy day long and tedious in this damp and dismal shelter. Nor was it\r\nwithout alarm that they saw the river gradually rise, till the level was\r\nwithin a foot of the floor of their retreat; and if it should rise high\r\nenough to overflow the cave, they were aware there could be no\r\npossibility of escape, for the waters already dashed against the cliffs\r\non each side of them. They watched anxiously. At length, with\r\nthankfulness, they saw the rain cease; and before darkness shut out\r\nobservation, the water had fallen a few inches. Then, free from their\r\nusual nightly torment of the bush-haunting mosquitos, they enjoyed a\r\ncalm night's rest in the cool cavern.\r\n\r\nMorning brought new cares. The casual storm had passed away, and it was\r\ntoo early for the usual tropical rainy season; but, alas! they had no\r\nmeans of voyaging onward, and the waters blockaded them. There was no\r\npath along the beach. They waited another day, in terror of famine or\r\nanother storm. A very slight decrease of the waters was seen next\r\nmorning. The cliffs were too high and precipitate for even the boldest\r\nto climb, the river too deep and impetuous to be crossed except in a\r\nboat, and the narrow hem of sand now left at the edge was barely\r\nsufficient for the passage of one person; and even it seemed to them\r\nthat in some places the rocks ran out so far that all progress must be\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\nThey might, perhaps, with great risk, have made their way along the\r\nbeach back to the sloping ascent to the cliffs which they had visited\r\ntwo days before, and thus gain the heights; but that would probably\r\nbring them into contact with the wild natives from whom they had fled in\r\nsuch haste. Besides, they were unwilling to leave the banks of the\r\nriver, which insured them fresh water, while, at the same time, it\r\nprevented them from being bewildered in a strange and perplexing\r\ncountry. Arthur asked his father to decide on what they should do in\r\nthis dilemma.\r\n\r\n\"I leave all to you, Arthur,\" answered he, \"as usual. I am distracted\r\nwith sinful doubts and fears. We cannot, I am aware, continue to live in\r\na cave, as men were wont to do in the early and barbarous ages; and the\r\nprospect of perilous wanderings in an unknown wilderness shakes my weak\r\nnerves. But I will trust in Him, my children, and pray for this blessed\r\nboon; may\r\n\r\n            'Israel's mystic guide,\r\n    The pillared cloud, our steps decide!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, make up your mind, General Arthur,\" said Hugh. \"Call up the\r\nforces and arrange the march. Gerald, my boy, you can make no objection\r\nto carry the _pratees_, I'm certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must each take a share in the toil of carrying off our slender\r\npossessions,\" said Margaret. \"Let Arthur divide and portion this duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Margaret,\" said Arthur, \"I determine that Nurse and you should\r\nunpack that portmanteau and tie up the contents in bundles, for the\r\nbetter convenience of division.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never ye fash to open it out, Miss,\" said Wilkins. \"I reckon I'se\r\nqualified to take that leather box on my back without breaking 't.\"\r\n\r\nBut Arthur would not suffer the good-natured fellow to be overloaded;\r\nand Margaret lightened the trunk by filling some pillow-covers with part\r\nof the contents, and these were suspended across the shoulders of\r\nArthur, Hugh, and Jack. Two of these useful bags were also filled with\r\npotatoes, to be carried by Mr. Mayburn and Gerald. Ruth would not leave\r\nher basket of poultry, and Margaret and Jenny collected the shells and\r\nsmall articles remaining. The locker was unwillingly left behind, as too\r\nheavy for carriage; and then, each carrying, in addition to his burden,\r\nsome weapon, they set out in single file, headed by Arthur, Wilkins\r\nfollowing close behind him, along the narrow sandy path, which was\r\nencumbered by masses of sandstone fallen from the rocks; and\r\noccasionally rendered still more difficult by the roots of a mangrove,\r\ntwisted with creepers, spreading even into the river, or a drooping\r\nacacia, or casuarina, which it was necessary laboriously to cut away, or\r\nto tear down, before they could force a passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nAlligators.--The Giant's Staircase.--Access to a New Region.--The\r\nPheasant Cuckoo.--Wild Oats.--The Unequal Contest.--The First\r\nKangaroo.--Scenes of Arcadia.--A Hint at Cannibalism.--The Cockatoo\r\nWatch.--The Enemy put to Flight.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cliffs which rose above their path were about three hundred feet in\r\nheight; these were almost perpendicular, and even, in some places,\r\noverhung the river; which had again spread out to about a mile in width,\r\nwhile rocky masses in the midst, covered with vegetation, formed\r\ninnumerable little islets, among which, even if they had saved their\r\ncanoes, they would have found it perilous to navigate.\r\n\r\n\"Hugh! Hugh!\" cried Gerald, who was at the end of the long line. \"I see\r\nour canoe; if you will join me, we will swim to it, and bring it in.\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed to the dark floating object he had pointed put,\r\nwhen suddenly Ruth screamed out, \"They're alive! Master Hugh, there's a\r\nlot on 'em. They'll eat us all up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I perceive now indeed,\" said Mr. Mayburn, in much agitation, \"what\r\nthese huge masses are. Observe, Margaret, on that island where the tall\r\nmangrove is so conspicuous, those dark moving forms; they are alligators\r\nstretched in the sun, while some of the dangerous creatures are floating\r\non the river. See, my children, how providentially we have been snatched\r\nfrom peril. One of these monsters might have capsized our little boat,\r\nand we should have been abandoned to be devoured by these frightful\r\ncreatures.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, Ruth shrieked out, and endeavored in her distraction to\r\nforce her way past the rest; but was held back by Jack, who followed her\r\nin the line, and who tried to convince her of the folly of her fears.\r\nNevertheless, they all felt more comfortable, when they lost sight of\r\nthe islets and their hideous inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAgain the river narrowed, and now they became alarmed as a strange\r\nrumbling noise gradually increased before them. They paused for\r\nconsideration; this was totally unlike the usual sounds of the\r\nwilderness, where the varied notes of the birds, and the continued\r\nhumming of the insects, alone disturbed the silence.\r\n\r\n\"It resembles the roaring of waters,\" said Arthur. \"I trust that now,\r\nwhen the river has obviously fallen, we need not fear that another flood\r\nshould overtake us. But follow me quickly--let us lose no time in\r\nendeavoring to reach the security of a wider strand.\"\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded, the roaring and rumbling grew louder and louder; they\r\nknew it was the voice of a torrent, and it was with beating hearts they\r\nwound round a bend in the course of the greatly narrowed river, and saw\r\nat a short distance before them a majestic cataract, pouring its foaming\r\nwaters into the river, which bounded and dashed onward like a troubled\r\nsea, even to the spot where the wanderers stood, transfixed with wonder\r\nand admiration at the spectacle.\r\n\r\n\"This is indeed the majesty of nature!\" exclaimed Mr. Mayburn. \"How\r\nfeeble seem all the labors of man, when compared with this stupendous\r\nwork of God!\r\n\r\n                    'How profound\r\n    The gulf! and how the giant element\r\n    From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,\r\n    Crushing the cliffs!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! Ay! it's a grand thing to see, master,\" said Wilkins; \"but how are\r\nwe to get out on our fix? We're not made wi' wings, like them big\r\nfellows, clamoring and diving at t' top yonder.\"\r\n\r\nA row of large birds were perched on fragments of rock at the very\r\nsummit of the fall, plunging their heads into the rushing waters, and\r\nseeming to rejoice in the grand commotion.\r\n\r\n\"They look like pelicans, papa,\" said Hugh; \"I can see the red pouch\r\nunder their throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bird is one of the family, I apprehend, my son,\" answered Mr.\r\nMayburn. \"It is commonly called the frigate pelican, and is peculiar to\r\nthe tropics, fishing in rivers as well as in the sea. Its wings and tail\r\nare immensely long, but the body, if stripped of the feathers, is much\r\nsmaller than you would expect to find it. But observe now, Hugh, a\r\nnobler bird. See, far above us soars a superb black eagle, which seems\r\nto look down with equal scorn on the noisy birds, the dashing waters,\r\nand the helpless men so far below it.\"\r\n\r\nAs they slowly drew near, they calculated that the height of the\r\ncataract must be a hundred and fifty feet at least, and saw that the\r\nwaters poured over horizontal strata of the sandstone rocks, each layer\r\nprojecting beyond the one above, and forming a series of steps, which\r\nrose from four to eight feet in height. The water did not descend in a\r\nvolume, but in courses, which left parts of the rocks uncovered, and on\r\nthese parts moss and even grass had sprung up.\r\n\r\nAmidst the admiration and enjoyment which all felt in the contemplation\r\nof this novel spectacle, an unpleasant conviction crossed the minds of\r\neven the most enthusiastic, that they were indeed, as Wilkins had\r\nremarked, \"in a fix.\" It was impossible to proceed unless they could\r\nascend the formidable brush-covered cliffs, where the weight of a man\r\nclinging to the bushes might bring down an avalanche of the crumbling\r\nsandstone rock to bury him in its fall; or, still more perilous, that\r\nthey should attempt to ascend what Gerald called \"the Giant's\r\nStaircase\"--the mighty cataract itself.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the torrent drowned the weaker voice of man; Arthur could\r\nnot understand that Gerald was calling out to Hugh to follow him; and\r\nbefore he could proclaim any interdiction, the two light-footed, active\r\nboys, by clinging to the firmly-rooted grass in the crevices, had gained\r\na resting-place on the first step of the rocks at the extreme edge of\r\nthe fall, and were calling on the rest to follow them.\r\n\r\nAt this extremity about four feet of the rocks remained dry from the\r\nsummit to the base, and certainly this must be the ladder they must\r\nmount if they hoped to escape; but how difficult, how perilous, was the\r\nattempt! Jack surveyed the ground attentively, then producing from his\r\npocket a large roll of cord, he tied one end to a mangrove-tree on the\r\nbeach, and unrolling it as he went up, followed the boys, holding the\r\nline tight to support Mr. Mayburn and Margaret, Jenny and Ruth, who,\r\nassisted by Arthur and Wilkins, were one after another raised to the\r\nfirst resting-place. Arthur soon joined them; but Wilkins remained to\r\nsee the whole ascent completed before he would leave the strand.\r\n\r\nDistracted by the noise of the torrent, the dashing of the spray, and\r\nthe terror lest the slippery stone or the supporting clump of grass\r\nshould fail them, it was a fearful struggle for the timid women, and for\r\nMr. Mayburn, quite as timid and much less light than they, to be raised\r\nfrom step to step, assisted always by Arthur below and Jack above; but\r\nfinally they were placed in safety on the heights of the cataract. Then\r\nJack waved his handkerchief, for his voice would have been inaudible, as\r\na signal for Wilkins to follow; and he, more accustomed than they to\r\nclimbing, loosed and leisurely wound up the cord, as he sprang from rock\r\nto rock, till he joined the grateful and happy family.\r\n\r\nThe first sentiment of all was thankfulness to God, poured forth in\r\nearnest prayer. Their next feeling was curiosity to look upon a new,\r\nopen country, after being so long imprisoned in the gloomy ravine below.\r\nThey saw that the river was no longer a broad, navigable stream, but was\r\nflowing through many narrow channels from the east and south-east, which\r\nunited above the cataract. An open and lovely glade lay before them,\r\nthinly wooded, and covered with tall grass, and flowers of the most\r\nbrilliant dyes. Birds of rare beauty and strange notes hovered about the\r\nrivulets, and the air was darkened with insects; but they saw no trace\r\nyet of man. Far away to the south-east lay a gray line of mountains,\r\ntowards which the wishes of all the anxious travellers turned.\r\n\r\n\"That range of mountains must be our first aim, papa,\" said Arthur.\r\n\"Thank God, we seem yet to be in a land of plenty; nor need we have any\r\nfear of destitution so long as we continue in a well-watered district.\r\nIf you are now able to proceed, Margaret, we must endeavor to bivouac\r\non some spot less exposed to the rays of the sun and the observation of\r\nthe natives than this. Let us follow the nearest channel of the river;\r\nif we wish to diverge further south, it will not be difficult to cross\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nA sharp twang startled Mr. Mayburn, and a beautiful bird fell at his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"Just as I wished it, sir,\" said Gerald. \"I meant the bird to be laid at\r\nyour feet. Wasn't it a capital shot, Hugh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky, at any rate, Gerald,\" answered Hugh. \"Well, papa, what bird is\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is perfectly new to me, Hugh,\" answered his father, \"as, indeed, all\r\nthe strange creation around me seems to be. The toes, like those of the\r\n_Scansores_, are placed two forward, and two backward, to facilitate the\r\nrunning up trees, and in form it so much resembles our cuckoo, that\r\ndoubtless it is the bird we have read of as the Pheasant-cuckoo. See,\r\nthere are more running among the grass, like pheasants--and hark how\r\nthey _whirr_ as they take to flight, now that they have been startled by\r\nthat mischievous boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe pheasants were tempting game, and several brace were bagged before\r\nMargaret could restrain the ardent sportsmen, and remonstrate on the\r\nwanton cruelty of destroying more than their necessities required. Then,\r\nbending their course to a low hill, on which stood a wild nutmeg-tree,\r\nthey saw that it was covered with beautiful white pigeons. On this spot\r\na fire was made, and the pheasants prepared for cooking, and then\r\nspitted on slender peeled bamboos, which were set up with one end in the\r\nground, round the fire. Gerald would gladly have added to the feast by\r\nshooting some of the confiding pigeons, which continued to feed on the\r\ngreen fruits of the nutmeg-tree, without any fear of their dangerous\r\nneighbors; but even Nurse reproved the boy for his destructive\r\ninclinations, declaring it would be very unlucky to shoot a white\r\npigeon.\r\n\r\nThough they hoped this resting-place would have proved pleasant, they\r\nsoon found it would be impossible to remain near the water, so intensely\r\nvexatious was the plague of flies. Thick clouds of these teasing\r\ncreatures buzzed round, settling in black bunches on the meat; filling\r\neyes, nose and mouth, and irritating the skin with their continual\r\nattempts to pierce it with their thin, tiny proboscis.\r\n\r\nThe boys declared the flies were ten times worse than the mosquitos; and\r\nto escape these Lilliputian foes, Arthur decided that they should cross\r\nsome of the narrow rills, which now ran wide apart, and deviate towards\r\nthe south, where a rising ground promised to introduce them to new\r\nscenery.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the hills, they found them steeper than they expected;\r\nbut on ascending to the height, they were gratified to see before them a\r\nbeautiful country. Lofty trees adorned the plain, and high grass rose\r\neven to their shoulders, as they passed through it. On several spots,\r\nvast fragments of the sandstone-rock, grown over with beautiful\r\nflowering creepers, lay in picturesque confusion; and the Eucalyptus,\r\nwith its spicy flowers, the Pandanus, loaded with fragrant blossoms, and\r\nthe Cabbage-palm, were also encircled by the parasitic plants which add\r\nsuch a grace to tropical scenery. Wearied with forcing their way through\r\nthe tall, sharp, wiry grass, they stopped before a high, broken rock\r\nwhich overhung and flung a shade over the spot they had selected for\r\ntheir resting-place. Then the boys cleared the ground, by laboriously\r\ncutting down the long grass, which they spread to form beds, a luxury to\r\nwhich they were unaccustomed.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better have fired it,\" said Wilkins. \"Our bush-ranging chaps\r\nalways sets it in a low; it saves trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be grieved to destroy the luxuriant vegetation that God has\r\nspread over these plains,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"Besides we could not\r\ncalculate where such a conflagration might end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Little matter where it ended,\" answered the man. \"There's lots of this\r\nstuff, such as it is; but Ruth, lass, ye've gotten hold on a better\r\nsample.\"\r\n\r\nRuth usually released her unfortunate chickens at each resting-place,\r\nthat they might have air, and seek food, and she had herself been\r\nrunning about for grubs, seeds, or any thing they could eat, and she now\r\nreturned with a perfect sheaf of some kind of bearded grain, suspended\r\non the ear by slender filaments like the oat, but still unripe.\r\n\r\n\"This surely should be an edible grain,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"and will\r\nprobably be ripe as early as November, in a climate which produces two\r\nharvests. How richly laden is each ear, and the straw cannot be less\r\nthan six feet in length. I conclude it is an _Anthistiria_. Feed your\r\nfowls, Ruth; the food is suitable, and happily abundant. Had we but a\r\nmill to grind it, we might hope in due season to enjoy once more the\r\nblessing of bread.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's not likely to be any mills handy hereabout,\" said Wilkins;\r\n\"but when folks is put to it, it's queer what shifts they can make. Just\r\nhand us over a handful of that there corn, my lass.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins soon found two flat stones suited to his purpose, spread the\r\nshelled grains on the larger stone and bruised the soft corn into a\r\npaste, which he handed over to Jenny, saying, \"Here's yer dough, mother!\r\nnow see and bake us a damper, bush fashion; it's poor clammy stuff yet a\r\nbit, but a bad loaf's better nor no bread.\"\r\n\r\nThen Wilkins showed Jenny that slovenly mode of bread-making, common\r\neven among the civilized colonists of Australia, the product of which is\r\na sort of pancake baked in the ashes. But this substitute for the staff\r\nof life was thankfully received by those who had been so long deprived\r\nof the genuine blessing; but the green paste was stringy and dry, and\r\nJenny proposed to blend a boiled potato with the next damper, to make it\r\nmore like bread.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Arthur, \"if we only boil it as a green vegetable,\r\nthis acquisition will be an agreeable addition to our roast birds.\r\nSuppose we each reap a bundle of the ears to carry onwards: at all\r\nevents the grains will feed the fowls.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys soon cut down a quantity of the heads of the corn, and early\r\nnext morning they rubbed out the grains, with which they filled several\r\nbags, Ruth herself collecting a store for the poultry. Then, resolving\r\nto wait till the heat of the day was over before they marched on their\r\njourney, Margaret employed herself in making useful bags of grass, while\r\nthe young men sauntered about, observing the novelties around them, and\r\nprocuring from one of the clear rivulets a large provision of fish for\r\nthe day's consumption.\r\n\r\n\"And see, Margaret,\" said Gerald, \"would you not have been proud, in\r\nEngland, of such a magnificent bouquet as this,\" presenting to her a\r\nbrilliant assemblage of flowers.\r\n\r\n\"Now, papa, come to our assistance,\" said Margaret, \"and name these\r\n'illustrious strangers.' Surely I scent among them our own delicious\r\nJasmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly resembles the jasmine, as well in form, as in perfume,\"\r\nanswered Mr. Mayburn. \"Yet, like all Australian productions, it differs\r\nessentially from the species it resembles. We will, however, name it\r\njasmine. This golden flower of the ranunculus race, might represent the\r\nbutter-cup of our meadows, yet it certainly is not the butter-cup. And\r\nthis might be a rose, with its slender stem, and pale-pink wax-like\r\npetals--is it not a _Boronea_, Arthur? This crimson flower resembles the\r\nsweet-pea, of which it has the scent, and the papillonaceous form. But\r\nit is vain to attempt to class, at once, a strange and marvellous new\r\nFlora. Well might Dr. Solander honor the first spot discovered of this\r\nlovely country with the name of Botany Bay, thus prophetically\r\nanticipating the rich harvests naturalists should reap in its wealth of\r\nplants. This is truly a tour of pleasure, my children, and I care not\r\nhow long I linger on the flowery road.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it were not for the flies and mosquitos, papa,\" added Hugh, rubbing\r\nhis tortured nose, which being rather prominent, was a favorite resort\r\nof the insects.\r\n\r\n\"What an advantage it is, in this country, to have a snub nose!\" said\r\nGerald. \"Oh! my boy, it is my turn to laugh now. But I say, Arthur!\r\nWilkins! What is yon fellow? See, papa, what a splendid spectacle!\"\r\n\r\nNot twenty yards from where they stood, and on part of the ground they\r\nhad cleared from the tall grass, they saw, with admiration mingled with\r\nfear, an immense bright yellow and brown serpent slowly winding among\r\nthe low stubble. No one seemed to know exactly how to act on seeing this\r\nstrange visitor, except Gerald, who sprung forward, armed with a stout\r\nstick; but Arthur forcibly held him back, and Wilkins said,--\r\n\r\n\"Let him be! let him be! ye'd best not mell on him. I ken his sneaking\r\nways; he never bites; but he squeezes like a millstone. Now then; he's\r\nafter his own business. See what he's at.\"\r\n\r\nAn elegant brownish-grey animal, which, though they now saw for the\r\nfirst time, they recognized at once, bounded from the grass; and while\r\nthe boys were crying out in ecstacy, \"The kangaroo! the kangaroo!\" they\r\nsaw the wily serpent raise itself, and envelope the terrified animal in\r\nits coils; and they knew well the doom of the poor kangaroo, for the\r\nembrace of its foe was certain death.\r\n\r\n\"Now come on, all on ye; we're safe enough now,\" cried Wilkins; and all\r\nthe young men, armed with sticks, and undeterred by the shrieks of the\r\nwomen, ran up to the animals, and attacked the serpent by striking the\r\nhead with repeated blows. When, roused to defence, it began to uncoil\r\nitself from its victim, knives were produced; and with many wounds, they\r\nsucceeded at length in putting an end to a creature at the very sight of\r\nwhich man instinctively shudders.\r\n\r\n\"Be sartin he's dead,\" said Wilkins. \"I'd niver trust them fellows; I've\r\nseen one on 'em march off two ways when he's been cut in two pieces.\r\nThey do say they niver die outright. But blacky has a way to settle and\r\nkeep him quiet: he just eats him.\"\r\n\r\nTo eat a serpent was an exploit at which the civilized stomach revolted;\r\nand the creature was abandoned to take its chance of reviving to commit\r\nmore destruction in the world, after Mr. Mayburn had examined it with as\r\nmuch interest as he could feel for a creature so abhorred. It was about\r\ntwelve feet long, and certainly one of the Boa family, but resembling\r\nmore the boa of Africa and Asia, than that of America. Mr. Mayburn\r\nearnestly desired to preserve the skin; but any additional incumbrance\r\nin the long pilgrimage that lay before them was not to be thought of,\r\nand he reluctantly relinquished the idea.\r\n\r\n\"I'd scorn to mell wi' such a foul beast,\" said Wilkins, \"for t' sake of\r\nhis bonnie skin; but by yer leave, I'se uncoil him, 'cause, ye see, a\r\nbit of kangaroo meat will suit us as well as he. It's canny fair meat,\r\nspecially about t' broad stern.\"\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo, which was but a young one, not standing more than four\r\nfeet in height, was extricated from the murderous grasp of the boa; but\r\nwas almost flattened by the powerful pressure. The boys gathered round\r\nthe strange animal with great curiosity, lost in admiration of its\r\ngraceful form, powerful hind legs, and pretty small head. The long ears,\r\ndivided upper lip, like that of the hare, long tapering tail, and\r\nremarkable pouch, in which a very young animal was found, were all\r\nremarked before it was skinned and turned over to the cooks. The skin\r\nwas then washed, and spread to dry, to be converted into boots when\r\nthose useful articles of clothing should be needed.\r\n\r\nBefore they set out, part of the kangaroo flesh was roasted, or rather\r\nbroiled, to be in readiness for supper, and the rest of the meat carried\r\noff by the willing Wilkins. Then, delighted with the novelties of the\r\nday, they went on in the same direction as before, walking cheerfully\r\nalong, uninterrupted by any alarm, through the wild and charming\r\nscenery, where bright skies, and birds and flowers, might have given a\r\nfanciful mind the idea of an Arcadia.\r\n\r\nThe sudden darkness of the tropics compelled them to rest at the foot of\r\nsome steep hills covered with brushwood, and opening on more forest-like\r\nscenery than any they had yet passed. Tiny rills trickled down the\r\ncrevices in the hills, and the rich emerald green of the turf proclaimed\r\na moist soil, and assured them they were yet far from the dreaded\r\ndeserts.\r\n\r\nTheir night's rest was again painfully disturbed, for, though at a great\r\ndistance, the peculiar _coo-ee_ of the natives was several times\r\ndistinctly heard; nor would Mr. Mayburn and Margaret venture to sleep\r\ntill a watch was arranged, of two persons, who were instructed to\r\nconverse loudly the whole time; for, according to the report of Wilkins,\r\nthe natives would never venture to attack a party who were prepared to\r\nreceive them.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be tracking us all along, Master Arthur,\" said Wilkins, as he\r\nand Arthur kept watch together. \"That's their way. Then they think to\r\nrun down on us unawares, to pick, and steal, and murder, and eat us up\r\ninto t' bargain, if they get a chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely not, Wilkins,\" answered Arthur. \"I know that the New Zealanders\r\nwere, in their original wild state, cannibals; but I never heard such\r\nan abominable character given of the Australian aborigines.\"\r\n\r\n\"If ye have to rove long about t' bush,\" answered the man, \"ye'll come\r\non many a picked bone that niver was that of a kangaroo or a 'possum.\r\nWhy, they'll not mind telling ye as how man's flesh is twice as tender\r\nas 'possum's. There's no dealing wi' 'em, master. They're just a mean\r\nlot. It were a bad job our losing them guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a loss, Wilkins,\" said Arthur; \"but I should not feel that I had\r\nthe same right to shoot a native that I had to shoot a kangaroo.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nought to choose atween 'em,\" replied Wilkins, \"but just\r\nthis--we can make a good meal of a kangaroo, and a Christian must be\r\nsore set afore he could stomach a black fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"But even a black man has a soul, Wilkins,\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"I question if these dogs have much of that,\" answered he; \"and if they\r\nhave oughts of soul, it's all given to him that's bad. Lord help us, Mr.\r\nArthur, they're all, as one may say, lost; like them creaturs as old\r\nmaster reads on, full of devils.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet those unhappy men, so possessed, you remember, Wilkins,\"\r\nanswered Arthur, \"were not lost beyond redemption. Our blessed Lord not\r\nonly banished the evil spirits, but forgave the men their sins. So might\r\nthese ignorant natives, if they were taught and received God's holy\r\nword, yet be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'se not set on gainsaying ye, Mr. Arthur, in that,\" said the man, \"for\r\nI were nigh as bad as them mysel'; and is yet, for what I ken, if I'd a\r\nchance to fall back. I'd like not, if I could help it; now when I ken\r\nreet fra' wrong; and pray God keep me fra' Black Peter and his crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark Wilkins! did you hear a rustling?\" asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but I tell you what I heared,\" replied he. \"I heared them\r\ncockatoos flacker and cry out, on yon trees; and depend on't they hear a\r\nstrange foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they are better watchmen than we are,\" said Arthur. \"What shall we\r\ndo, Wilkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just ye tell your folks not to be fleyed at nought,\" said he, \"and\r\nwe'll set them rogues off in no time.\"\r\n\r\nArthur warned Margaret and his father not to be alarmed at any noise\r\nthey might hear, and the other young men, roused at the report of an\r\nassault, were soon in the ranks. Then, at a signal agreed, they raised\r\ntheir voices in a simultaneous halloo! that rang against the rocky\r\nhills. A loud rustling succeeded, and a dozen dark figures, visible in\r\nthe moonlight, emerged from the bushes, and fled swiftly across the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n\"Saved!\" cried Hugh: \"for this time at least. But, I say, Arthur, we\r\nmust not sleep in the bush every night, or they'll catch us at last. I\r\nsaw several fine roomy caves in the rocks as we came along. We must take\r\npossession of the next we fall in with, and then we shall only have the\r\nentrance to guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"They held spears in their hands, I saw,\" said Gerald; \"I wonder why\r\nthey did not send a few among us?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're ower sly for that, Master Gerald,\" said Wilkins. \"They'd like\r\nto come on us all asleep, and butcher us. Now they'll dog us, day after\r\nday; but if we hold on steady-like, we'se wear 'em out at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we could but put a good broad river between us,\" said Jack, \"we\r\nmight feel safe. Did you see that stringy bark tree just at hand, Mr.\r\nArthur? I marked it in my mind, and if Master Hugh, and you, and Master\r\nO'Brien will help me, we will twist some long ropes, on our road\r\nto-morrow, and then, I fancy, if we came to a river we could not ford,\r\nwe might contrive a ferry-boat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nRope-making.--The Cavern of Illustrations.--Ruth at the\r\nWater-pools.--Victualling the Fortress.--The Blockade.--Assault and\r\nBattery.--Bloodshed.--The close Siege.--Prospect of Famine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn was uneasy till they set out next morning; for the thick\r\nbush-covered hill was a convenient spot for concealment. They left their\r\nsleeping-place, therefore, at the earliest dawn, and continued their\r\nprogress, while the young men found several trees of the stringy bark;\r\nthe strips of the bark, measuring twenty or thirty feet, were hanging\r\nfrom the trunk raggedly, but very conveniently for the purpose of the\r\nworkmen, who collected a quantity of the rolls of bark, and carried it\r\non their shoulders, till a singular isolated column of rock attracted\r\nthem to examine it; and as it afforded a little shade, and stood in an\r\nopen glade, where they need not fear hidden enemies, they rested at the\r\nfoot of it, and eat their breakfast of kangaroo steaks. Then Jack,\r\nfixing short poles into the ground to tie the bark to, soon set all the\r\nyouths to work to twist strong ropes of considerable length. They spent\r\nsome hours in this labor, and completed so heavy a burden of ropes, that\r\nwhen they set out again they looked anxiously for an opportunity of\r\nrelieving themselves by putting the ropes to profitable use. They\r\ndirected their steps towards a rocky range before them, which held out a\r\nprospect of protection for the night; and bending under the weight of\r\ntheir burden, they were glad to reach the straggling, mountainous,\r\nsandstone rocks which, running east and west, interrupted their direct\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nIt was always easy in these ranges to find caves or hollow grottos,\r\nconvenient for a retreat, and the bright moon showed them a low opening,\r\nwhich admitted them into a spacious and lofty cave. It was large enough\r\nto have contained fifty persons, dry and clean--for the floor was of\r\nfine sand; and when they had lighted a fire, they discovered that they\r\nwere not the first who had inhabited the cave, for the walls were\r\ncovered with rude, colored paintings of men and animals--the men and\r\nanimals of Australia. With great amusement and astonishment the boys\r\nlooked on the kangaroo, the opossum, many curious lizards, and heads of\r\nmen, colossal in size, and imperfect in execution, somewhat resembling\r\nthe ambitious child's first attempts at high art.\r\n\r\n\"I think I couldn't draw so good a kangaroo as that myself,\" said\r\nGerald; \"but I could make something more like the head of a man. Do\r\nlook, Margaret; that fellow has crimson hair and a green nose.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have not, certainly,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"attained perfection in\r\nthe art of coloring; nevertheless, the uninstructed men who could\r\naccomplish these drawings cannot be so deficient in abilities as we have\r\nbeen taught to believe these aborigines are. I wish we could, with\r\nsafety to ourselves, hold intercourse with a small number of them. Could\r\nit not be attempted, Arthur?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they would approach us openly, we would endeavor to meet them\r\namicably, my dear father,\" answered Arthur; \"but when they steal on us\r\ntreacherously, we must conclude their intentions are hostile. Even now\r\nwe must prepare for defence; and though we might keep watch at the\r\nopening, I think we had better build it up.\"\r\n\r\nThey soon secured the entrance with slabs of stone, and then eat their\r\nsupper, and slept with less uneasiness than usual.\r\n\r\n\"Who has moved them stones?\" asked Wilkins, sharply, as, roused by the\r\nlight streaming in, he sprung from the nook he had chosen for his lair.\r\n\r\n\"It's that fidgety lass,\" answered Jenny. \"She's been scuttling about\r\nthis hour, feeding her poultry, and setting things to rights as if we\r\nwere living in a parlor; and then she roused me up to help her to make a\r\nbit of way to get out to fetch water. You see, Wilkins, she's a\r\nhard-working lass, but it's her way to make a fuss.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fuss, indeed!\" replied he, indignantly; \"and a nice fuss she would\r\nhave made if she'd let a hundred black fellows in on us. Halloo, Jack!\r\nit would be as well if we were off to see after that unlucky sister of\r\nthine.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the family were soon aware of Ruth's errantry, but they did\r\nnot expect she would be far from the cave, as the water was spread in\r\npools and rills, abundantly, at the foot of the rocks. The next minute,\r\nhowever, they were startled by a succession of shrieks, and snatching up\r\ntheir weapons, the young men rushed out, and then saw, to their great\r\nvexation, Ruth running wildly towards them, pursued by six of the\r\nnatives, in their usual unclothed state; and it was plain their swift\r\nsteps would soon overtake the affrighted girl, unless they were promptly\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\n\"Shout as loud as ye like,\" cried Wilkins, \"but mind not to send a\r\nsingle arrow without hitting, or they'll not care a dump for us. See and\r\naim to do some damage--d'ye hear?\"\r\n\r\nThe natives were yelling and waving their spears, and their opponents\r\nanswered by hallooing and brandishing their glittering knives, at the\r\nsight of which the savages stopped suddenly, and looked anxiously round,\r\nas if expecting reinforcement; then discharging a volley of spears, they\r\nturned round and rapidly fled out of sight.\r\n\r\nRuth was left lying prostrate on the ground, and when Jack got up to\r\nher, he found a spear had struck her on the shoulder, but fortunately\r\nstuck in her wide cloak, without injuring her, though her terror and\r\ndistress were great.\r\n\r\n\"They'll eat me up,\" she cried out. \"They'll eat us all, Jack; and, oh,\r\nwhat will Jenny say? they've gotten my water-can!\"\r\n\r\nIn her great fear, the poor girl had thrown away the useful\r\ngourd-bottle--a serious loss; and Gerald was intrusted to convey her\r\nback to the cave, while the rest went forward to the pools, in hopes of\r\nrecovering the gourd and procuring water. The vessel was, happily,\r\nfound, and filled with water, and the youths returned to the cave, where\r\nthey found great alarm prevailing.\r\n\r\n\"Had we not better flee without delay?\" asked Mr. Mayburn.\r\n\r\nArthur looked significantly at Wilkins, and the man said,--\"Ay, ay, Mr.\r\nArthur! ye have a head; ye can see a bit afore ye. Why, master, a bonnie\r\nfigure we should cut running ower yon bare grounds--men folks and women\r\nfolks, all like a pack of scared rabbits, wi' a pack of a hundred or so\r\nof these naked black dogs at our heels.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my good man, if we stay here we shall be slain,\" said Mr. Mayburn,\r\nin great agitation.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, dear papa,\" answered Arthur. \"I conclude that Wilkins's plan\r\nis, that we should remain here, and hold our impregnable castle till the\r\nfoe grows tired of the hopeless siege.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the best thing,\" said Wilkins; \"they're a set of stiff hands,\r\nand we'se be put to it to tire 'em out; but we'll try what we can do.\r\nAnd, I say, master, we must give a look round for stores; we'll never\r\nlet 'em starve us out. It takes good rations to get up one's heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if we have to be shut up some time,\" said Margaret, much\r\ndistressed, \"we must have, especially, a supply of water.\"\r\n\r\n\"In course, Miss,\" answered Wilkins; \"that's a thing we cannot want,\r\nbarring we had beer, which isn't to be had, more's the pity. Let's see;\r\nif we'd a bit of a tub or barrel, we'd easy fill't now, afore they're\r\nback on us. Nay, nay, Jenny, woman; let that meat be just now, and bring\r\nus all your shells, or aught that'll hold water.\"\r\n\r\nThe gourd was emptied into the large turtle-shell, and Wilkins took it\r\nback to be refilled at the pools, the rest following with the largest of\r\nthe mussel-shells; and as they went on, they carefully looked out for\r\nany available article of food that could be easily attained before the\r\nreturn of the enemy. The air was thronged with birds, and every tree was\r\nan aviary. They might soon have brought down a quantity with their\r\narrows, but Arthur urged on them the necessity of first obtaining the\r\nwater. After they had filled all their water-vessels, they found they\r\nshould only have a supply for two days, even if carefully husbanded.\r\nThankful even for this boon, they had yet time to shoot a dozen\r\npheasants, before the _coo-ee_ of the natives, gradually getting nearer,\r\nmade it necessary that they should seek the cave, and make ready their\r\ndefences.\r\n\r\nTheir first care was to fortify strongly the opening which formed their\r\nentrance, and which they hoped was the only weak point. But as it was\r\nevident, from the paintings, that this cave was well known to the\r\nnatives, it was expedient to search it thoroughly, lest there should be\r\nother outlets. Many branches ran from the main cave, but all seemed\r\nequally impregnable; and the only openings were small gaps far above the\r\nground, from which the decomposed sandstone had fallen, and lay\r\nscattered in fragments over the ground. There were traces of fires,\r\nshowing that the cave had been previously inhabited, but no remains of\r\nfuel; and a few withered sticks that they had brought in the preceding\r\nday were all the provision they had made for cooking their food.\r\n\r\n\"After all our wild and savage life,\" said Hugh, \"we are not yet come\r\ndown to eat uncooked meat, I really think; and by your leave, Captain\r\nArthur, we will make a sally to pick up sticks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look through this cranny, Hugh, and tell me if you think this is a time\r\nfor throwing open our gates,\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"I give in! I give in!\" answered the boy. \"Look out, Gerald; see what a\r\nswarm of dark wretches, all in earnest too, for they have sheaves of\r\nspears in the left hand, while the right hand is raised to do battle.\r\nKeep back, Ruth! you simpleton. You have certainly seen enough of these\r\nugly monsters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh Miss Marget!\" shrieked the girl, \"they'll come in and eat us. Stone\r\nwalls is nought to 'em. They're not Christian folks, they're spurrits!\r\nthey 're skellingtons; I ken 'em by their bones. Oh! send them back to\r\ntheir graves, master!\"\r\n\r\nWithin thirty yards of the rock, and immediately before it, were\r\ngathered crowds of fierce savages; their dark skins marked with a white\r\nsubstance like pipe-clay, in fantastic figures; most of them were\r\npainted to represent skeletons. And while, with wild and demoniac yells,\r\nthey were leaping and whirling round with graceful agility, they poised\r\ntheir spears, ready to cast them as soon as a victim appeared in sight.\r\nThere was a painful expression of surprise and vexation on every face;\r\nand Jack, usually so indulgent to his sister's foibles, could not help\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Ruth, lass! this is thy doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Jack, honey!\" sobbed she, \"what could I think, when I seed that\r\nbig grinning black face glouring at me fra' t' middle on a bush, and\r\nnone nigh hand me: and oh! honey, I'd setten out afore I said my\r\nprayers. What could I do but just skirl and run? and I did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you did, Ruth, and no mistake,\" said O'Brien. \"But, after all,\r\nit's better to have our enemies before our face than at our back. Will I\r\nsend an arrow among them, Arty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, Gerald,\" answered Arthur; \"we may need all our arrows,\r\nand we had better not be the first to commence an aggression. If we had\r\nhad plenty of powder and shot, I have no doubt we might have dispersed\r\nthem without bloodshed; but I am loth to waste a single cartridge of\r\nour small store. What are they about now, Hugh?\"\r\n\r\nOne tall savage had mounted a mass of rock about thirty yards from them;\r\nand now, with wonderful dexterity, he sent a spear whirling through the\r\nair directly through a small gap in the rock, about twenty feet from the\r\nground. Most fortunately, Arthur had ordered the whole party to gather\r\nclose to the entrance, and the weapon passed on one side of them, and\r\nfalling upon a shell of water tilted it over.\r\n\r\n\"Good-for-nothing rascals!\" cried Jenny. \"See what a mischief they've\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be thankful, nurse,\" said Arthur, \"that we saw the intention of the\r\nfellow, and were able to escape the spear. We now know our weak points,\r\nand may keep out of harm's way.\"\r\n\r\nBut Gerald, who thought the first aggression was committed, no longer\r\nscrupled to draw his bow, and sent an arrow, which he had barbed with\r\nskill, into the shoulder of the warrior on the rock, with such force,\r\nthat he was hurled to the ground. In an instant all his companions\r\ncrowded around him; he was raised from the ground, and the whole party\r\ndisappeared in the bush, with every symptom of terror.\r\n\r\nWilkins was in an ecstasy of delight. He patted Gerald roughly on the\r\nback, saying, \"That's the thing, my brave lad; ye're of the right sort;\r\nye've let the rogues see what we can do. But if ye'd missed him we'd\r\nevery soul been done. They'd have reckoned nought on us.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a rash act, Gerald,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"but I hope the poor man\r\nis not seriously injured.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins made a grimace as he said, \"Them there arrows is made o'\r\npurpose to injer, master. They're a bit sharpish to bide when they bang\r\nin among a fellow's bones, and no doctor at hand to hack 'em out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you, Master Gerald,\" said Ruth, \"that it were a sin and a\r\nshame to make them things as would rive folks' flesh?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the girl that said that,\" answered Gerald, wild with his\r\nexploit; \"and weren't you right, Ruth, _astore_! I meant them to _rive_;\r\nand see how the cowards have scampered off from them. Couldn't we go out\r\nnow, Arthur? You know we want firewood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be impatient, Gerald,\" replied Arthur, \"we have fuel sufficient\r\nfor one day, and we do not know how far our foes may have fled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Depend on't, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins, \"there's not a bush or a rock\r\nwe see but has its man. We'll have to make shift to live on what we have\r\nfor a bit. They'll soon be trying another dodge.\"\r\n\r\nBut though the usual _coo-ee_ rang through the distant woods, mingled\r\nwith the soft low wailing of the voices of women, the people were not\r\nseen again during a day which seemed unusually long to the anxious\r\nprisoners. The women cooked the pheasants with the last firewood, while\r\nMargaret filled a pillow-cover with the feathers for her father's head;\r\nbut they had all become so accustomed to the hard earth, or at best to a\r\nbed of wiry grass, that even Mr. Mayburn regarded this pillow as a\r\nuseless luxury, and an undesirable addition to the baggage, which\r\nrendered their journey so tedious.\r\n\r\n\"I will undertake to carry the light pillow,\" said Margaret, \"and I\r\ntrust we may again meet with a river to lighten the toil of our\r\npilgrimage.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we found a wagon drawn by oxen, like them Mr. Deverell bought,\"\r\nsaid Jenny, \"it would be fitter for my master and you, Miss Marget.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a few good horses for the rest of us, nurse,\" said Hugh; \"but say\r\nwhat you will, papa, of the beauty and excellence of this new country,\r\nit is a great vexation that there are no beasts of burden. Neither\r\nelephant nor camel; not even a llama or a quagga which may be reduced to\r\nservitude. No four-footed creature have we yet seen but the kangaroo;\r\nand one never read, even in the Fairy Tales, of a man hopping along,\r\nmounted on a kangaroo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing for it but trudging, Hugh,\" said Gerald, \"unless we could meet\r\nwith an ostrich to tame.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" replied Mr. Mayburn, \"that the emu, which is the ostrich of\r\nAustralia, is not formed for carrying burdens, nor tractable enough to\r\nsubmit to the dominion of man. I am anxious to see the bird, though I\r\nfear we may obtain no advantage from meeting with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn rambling among the caves to fill up the tedious hours, the boys\r\ndiscovered, in a distant branch cavern, a heap of dry wood which had\r\nfallen through an opening in the rock, at least fifty feet above them.\r\nIf this opening were even known to the natives, it could not avail them\r\nas a means of descent to the cave, and, much to the mortification of the\r\nadventurous boys, it was totally inaccessible from the interior.\r\n\r\n\"But we can comfort nurse's heart,\" said Hugh, \"by the report that we\r\nhave found fuel enough for an English winter. And see, Gerald, some of\r\nthese strong straight sticks will make us a sheaf of arrows, and we can\r\nbarb them with the fish-bones we preserved. Here's our work for the\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort to Margaret to have the two most restless of the party\r\nquietly employed; though Mr. Mayburn objected to the barbing of the\r\narrows, so unnecessary for destroying birds, so cruel if meant for the\r\nsavages. Wilkins sat down to make a pair of shoes of the skin of the\r\nkangaroo, and Jack made more ropes with the remains of the stringy bark.\r\nAnd thus the day of anxiety passed without more alarm.\r\n\r\nAnother morning dawned through the chinks of the rocky walls, and for\r\nsome time all was so still, that they began to hope the natives had\r\nwithdrawn; but before the middle of the day the whole troop presented\r\nthemselves so suddenly, that they were close to the rocks, and thus,\r\nsecure from the arrows of the besieged, before they could prevent their\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nThey had come armed with heavy clubs, with which they began violently to\r\nbatter the walled entrance. This was a formidable mode of attack, and\r\nthe only mode of defence was to accumulate more stones to strengthen the\r\nbarrier. Still the men persevered, fresh parties relieving those who\r\nwere tired; but the defence seemed already shaking; while Margaret,\r\nalways resolute in difficulties, had herself almost lost the power of\r\nconsoling her more timid father. Wilkins seemed watching for an\r\nopportunity, placed before a narrow crevice in the rock, which was\r\nshaded outside by brush, and suddenly they saw him plunge his long knife\r\nthrough the opening against which he had seen one of the natives\r\nleaning.\r\n\r\nThe knife entered the back of the man, who uttered a groan, and fell. He\r\nwas immediately surrounded by the rest, who examined the wound, and then\r\ngazed round, apparently unable to comprehend the nature of this attack\r\nfrom an invisible enemy. Some of the men fled at once, many of them\r\npierced by the arrows the young men sent after them, while others\r\nremained to bear away, with care and tenderness, the bleeding body of\r\ntheir companion, who appeared to be mortally wounded. These humane men\r\nwere respected, even by their opponents, and permitted to retire\r\nunmolested; and for the remainder of the day, except for the sounds of\r\nmourning from the native women, which, however, gradually became more\r\nfaint and distant, all continued still and peaceful.\r\n\r\nThe next morning broke on the besieged party with the melancholy\r\nconviction that their fortress was no longer tenable. The spring was\r\nalready advanced, the air had become hot and parching, and the water was\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n\"We must endeavor, under any circumstances,\" said Arthur, \"to procure\r\nwater, or we must die. I propose that three of us should set out to the\r\nnearest pool for a supply, leaving the rest to guard the entrance; and\r\nif we are successful, to re-admit us. If the savages should attack and\r\novercome us, then it will be the duty of those left here to close the\r\nbarrier, leaving us to our fate, and to use every exertion in their\r\npower to protect and save the feeble.\"\r\n\r\nSad as was this necessity, it was imperative, and now the question was,\r\nwho were to have the honor of joining the \"Forlorn Hope,\" as Hugh termed\r\nthe expedition. Arthur decided that the party should consist of Hugh,\r\nWilkins, and himself. Jack was too useful to be risked, Gerald too rash\r\nto be trusted.\r\n\r\nArthur would not even take with him the valuable rifle, their prime\r\nreliance, but left it in the charge of Jack. Then, with bows and arrows\r\nslung over their backs, and such water-vessels as they could command in\r\ntheir hands, they cautiously went out, leaving orders to the garrison,\r\nthat each man should stand before his slab of stone, to be ready to\r\nreplace it before the opening, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThey reached the pool without interruption, satisfied their own thirst,\r\nfilled the vessels, and then, with joy and triumph, turned homewards.\r\nBut before they had proceeded many yards, a loud \"_Coo-ee_,\" not far\r\nfrom them, proved they had not escaped notice. The cry was echoed from\r\nmany distant spots, and the water-carriers redoubled their speed, till a\r\nspear, whizzing close to the ear of Wilkins, induced Arthur to call a\r\nhalt. They faced round, set down their water-buckets, and handled their\r\nbows. They saw that they were pursued by about a dozen men, who were\r\nthirty or forty yards behind them, amongst whom they discharged arrows,\r\ntwo or three times in rapid succession, with some effect, it would seem,\r\nfrom the confusion and irresolution which they observed had taken place\r\namong the natives; of which they took advantage, and snatching up their\r\nvaluable burdens, they reached the cave before the savages rallied, and,\r\nbeing joined by a reinforcement, were quickly following them.\r\n\r\n\"Up with the defences,\" cried Arthur, breathlessly. \"And now, thank God!\r\nwe shall be able to hold out two or three days longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall have to live on potatoes and these few green oats,\" said\r\nJenny, \"for we have only six pheasants left, and they spoil fast in this\r\nhot place. But, to be sure, there's them greedy hens, that can eat as\r\nmuch as a man, and are no good, unless we eat them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, Jenny, please don't!\" cried Ruth. \"See, here's six eggs they've\r\nlaid; isn't that some good? poor bit things! Oh, Miss Marget, dinnot let\r\n'em be killed!\"\r\n\r\nMargaret willingly granted the fowls their lives, the eggs being\r\nconsidered equivalent to the oats the animals consumed; and she begged\r\nJenny to have more trust in God, who had till now continued to supply\r\ntheir \"daily bread.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nRambles through the Caves.--Fairy Bower.--A Rough Path to\r\nFreedom.--Preparations for Flight.--The Use of the Rifle.--A Case of\r\nConscience.--Departure.--Travelling among the Bogs.--A View of the\r\nRiver.--Making an Axe.--A New Plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter they had dined with strict economy, and ascertained that their\r\nsavage foes had for the present withdrawn into the bush, they resumed\r\ntheir usual occupations. Hugh and Gerald, impatient under their\r\nconfinement, chose to ramble through the mazy windings of the various\r\nhollows which existed in the sandstone rock, searching for a long time\r\nin vain for novelty or adventure; at length they wound along a branch\r\npassage, which terminated, to their astonishment, in a wall, hung, like\r\na bower, with garlands of flowery creeping plants, from which the notes\r\nof various birds greeted the ears of the delighted boys.\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough, Hugh, this is Fairy Bower,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"It is open to the day,\" said Hugh, \"and we must find out what lies\r\nbeyond it.\"\r\n\r\nA slab of rock, which had fallen inwards, lay close to the wall; it was\r\nsix feet in height, but by making a staircase of other fragments which\r\nwere lying round, they mounted the fallen slab, and putting aside the\r\nleafy curtains which hid the opening, they looked out on a complete\r\nwilderness of rocky masses and green thickets, which appeared at once\r\nimpervious and interminable. The temptation to be once more under the\r\nopen sky could not be resisted, and without much difficulty the boys\r\ndescended among the matted bushes.\r\n\r\n\"We will follow out the adventure,\" said Gerald, \"till we reach the\r\nEnchanted Castle. Had we not better cut some spears as we make our way,\r\nthat we may be prepared to slay the dragons?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better have had one of Jack's balls of cord,\" replied Hugh,\r\n\"that we might have tied one end here before we set out, or we shall\r\nnever be able to find our way back through such a labyrinth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we drop pebbles, as Hop-o'-my-Thumb did?\" asked Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we to get the pebbles?\" answered Hugh, \"and how could we find\r\nthem again, man, among this brush? But what is this white,\r\nchalky-looking material by the pool? I cannot help thinking it must be\r\nthe clay which the savages use for painting their bodies. Let us get\r\nsome; I have a use for it.\"\r\n\r\nThey collected some of this moist pipe-clay on a large leaf, and\r\nclimbing again to the opening, they cut away a portion of the creepers\r\nto uncover the rock, upon which they marked, as high as they could\r\nreach, a large white cross.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot miss that holy and propitious sign,\" said Hugh, \"so let us\r\nventure forward, Gerald. It is such a charming novelty to be able to\r\nwalk fearlessly in the open air. You observe we are now facing the\r\nsouth; so if we can discover an outlet from this thicket, we shall be on\r\nthe direct track to continue our journey.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not easy, however, to preserve any direct course through the\r\ntangled brake, which was occasionally broken by patches of fine grass\r\nand rills of water, and diversified by tall trees; the various kinds of\r\nEucalyptus, the wild nutmeg with its spicy odor, and the acacia covered\r\nwith golden blossoms, the whole being mingled with masses of rock fallen\r\nfrom the regular range, broken into fragments and scattered far and\r\nwide; some grown over with the vegetation of years, and others freshly\r\nrent from the soft decaying mountains.\r\n\r\nThreading their way through this lovely wilderness, not forgetting to\r\nlook back frequently at their guiding signal, the boys now hailed with\r\npleasure and admiration the sight of thousands of birds springing from\r\ntheir nests, while each, in its own peculiar language, seemed to\r\ndeprecate the intrusion of the presumptuous strangers.\r\n\r\n\"Won't we carry back birds and eggs enough to victual the fortress for a\r\nweek!\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"No need for that, Gerald,\" answered Hugh, \"when we have the preserve in\r\nour own private grounds. We can just bag a brace or two, to prove the\r\ntruth to our people. But, now, my boy, we must try to find the end of\r\nthis wonderful maze--who knows but what it may lead to liberty?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a rough road anyhow,\" said Gerald. But they struggled through\r\nthick bushes, leaped over rocks, or waded through pools or rills for\r\nmore than an hour, and then, fearful of alarming their friends, they\r\nproposed to return. But just as they had made this resolve, Hugh\r\ndeclared that he heard the sound of rolling water, and they continued\r\ntheir toilsome exertions till they reached at length the side of a rapid\r\nriver, which poured through a narrow gorge in the mountains, and flowed\r\ntowards the west. The river seemed about fifty yards across, and too\r\ndeep to be forded; the banks were overgrown with tall bamboos mingled\r\nwith fine rushes; but beyond the south banks, the country appeared more\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\"If we could only cross this river,\" said Hugh, \"we should completely\r\nescape from those cowardly blacks, who have, I believe, no canoes. We\r\nwill bring Jack here; he can find bark in abundance for his use, and if\r\nwe help him, I have no doubt he can make a canoe that will carry us\r\nacross. At any rate, let us take him a piece of the bark to tempt him to\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\nThey soon stripped from the stem a piece of flexible bark, and, with\r\nsome of the fibres of the stringy bark, they tied this into a bag, which\r\nthey filled, as they returned, with eggs and four brace of good-sized\r\nyoung pheasants. They kept in the track they had made in coming, and\r\nhaving the white cross before them as a guide, they had much less\r\ndifficulty in their homeward course than they expected, and in very\r\ngreat spirits presented themselves before their greatly anxious friends.\r\n\r\n\"We have been out on a sporting expedition,\" said Gerald, flinging down\r\nthe birds. \"What do you think of our game-bag, General Arthur?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must think that you have been very rash and imprudent,\" answered\r\nArthur. \"I conclude, boys, that you have found some other outlet from\r\nthe cave; but how could you risk discovery for the sake of these birds?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have discovered an outlet,\" replied Hugh; \"but I think even Margaret\r\nand my father will agree that there was no risk, when they see the\r\nplace. Now you must all listen to our wonderful adventure.\"\r\n\r\nThey did listen with great pleasure and thankfulness. The earnest desire\r\nof every heart was to escape from the constant dogged and depressing\r\npursuit of their savage and artful foes, and the account of the\r\nunsuspected path to the river filled them with the hopes which they had\r\nnearly abandoned.\r\n\r\n\"Can we not set out now?\" asked Mr. Mayburn eagerly. \"Certainly not, my\r\nfather,\" answered Arthur. \"It will first be necessary that we have some\r\nmeans arranged for crossing the river; besides, the day is too far\r\nadvanced for us to make such an important movement before night; and we\r\nmust try to divert the suspicions of the savages from our flight, by\r\nletting them believe we still intend to hold the fortress.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you're not knocked up, Master Hugh,\" said Jack, \"I should like well\r\nto see with my own eyes what there is to do, and whether I can do it or\r\nnot. Would you mind guiding me; and Wilkins, may be, will go with us, to\r\nhelp me to carry down my ropes?\"\r\n\r\nWilkins was always ready and willing; he shouldered a coil of rope, and\r\nthe two unwearied boys, followed by him and Jack, set out to show their\r\nmarvellous discovery to the two practical men, who looked round at the\r\ncharming wilderness with an eye to the usefulness rather than to the\r\nbeauty of all they saw.\r\n\r\n\"Birds is poor feeding, and eggs is worse,\" said Wilkins; \"but if we\r\niver get free fra' them dowly stone walls, we'se see if we can't get a\r\nshot at them kangaroos. Ay, ay! Master Hugh, any sky over head's better\r\nnor a jail; not but I've been shut in worse prisons nor yon, God forgive\r\nme; but ye see I were reet sarved then. But it is aggravatin, I say, to\r\nbar oneself up wi' one's own will like.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, Wilkins,\" exclaimed Jack; \"what a grand stock of all kinds of\r\nwood, if we had but a few good tools. I noticed that a black fellow that\r\nwas fighting yesterday had a capital axe in his hand; it seemed to be\r\nmade of a sort of flint stone, and I only wish we could meet with a\r\npiece fit for such a job.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not a time to be felling trees,\" replied Wilkins, \"when we've a\r\ntroop of black rogues at our heels. Now come, we're here, it seems, at\r\nt' river they telled on, and a canny river it is; if we can manage to\r\nput it atween us and them, we'se have a clear coast, I reckon; for they\r\nalways keep at their own side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then help me to bark this tree,\" said Jack; \"and if we cannot manage a\r\ncanoe, we'll try a ferry-boat.\"\r\n\r\nThe tree was barked in one long sheet, the ends were tied up with cords,\r\nand this was Jack's extempore canoe. But as soon as it was hastily\r\ncompleted, they were compelled to speed homeward to prevent themselves\r\nbeing bewildered in the darkness; and even now, but for the visible\r\nwhite cross, they would have been unable to distinguish the entrance.\r\n\"Now, Nurse, darling,\" cried Gerald, dancing round Jenny, \"pack up your\r\npots and pans and bundles, and you, Ruth, call up your precious chicks,\r\nand make ready. Then, at daybreak, when you hear me whistle the\r\n_réveille_, fall into your ranks, to march.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not know how far the ground beyond the wilderness may be\r\nexposed,\" said Arthur, \"and we had better look out before we leave in\r\nthe morning, to observe if all continues still.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all just as it ought, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins; \"ye're a sharp\r\nchap at a drill. And we'd as well puzzle 'em a bit, and rattle out a few\r\narrows just afore we start, to make 'em believe we mean to haud our\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when all was ready for setting out, and they had laid\r\nthe foundation of a good breakfast, the scream of Ruth, who had climbed\r\nto an aperture to obtain a look-out, announced that the objects of her\r\nantipathy were in sight. All flocked to the crevices to ascertain what\r\nthey had to fear, and observed that a number of the natives were laden\r\nwith bundles of dry wood, which they had piled before the rock, and made\r\nup a fire, having apparently chosen to establish themselves there, and\r\nkeep a perpetual watch, and yet keep too close to the rock to be in\r\ndanger from the arrows of the besieged. This was vexatious, and Wilkins\r\nsaid,--\"Ye're tied to waste a shot on 'em, or here they'll sit and watch\r\nand listen, and sure enough they'll make out we're away, if they hear\r\nnought stirring inside, and they'll be off to stop us. Look at yon\r\nfellow, painted red, quavering about, and banging t' stones wi' his axe.\r\nThat's t' chap as sent his spear close to my ears, and I owe him yet for\r\nthat job. Just let me have a chance, Mr. Arthur. I ken ye're all\r\nsoft-hearted, so I'se not kill him outright.\"\r\n\r\nArthur was very reluctant to waste one cartridge or spill one drop of\r\nblood; but the fierce gestures of the powerful savage, and his violent\r\nblows against the walled entrance, rendered him a dangerous antagonist;\r\nand on the promise of Wilkins that he would not mortally wound the man,\r\nArthur resigned the loaded rifle to one he knew to be well skilled in\r\nfire-arms.\r\n\r\nWilkins carefully selected his position and his time, and when the\r\nsavage raised his arm for the stroke, he fired into his shoulder. With\r\na horrible yell, the man threw down the axe, and fell upon his face. In\r\na moment the whole troop, with cries of terror, were flying towards the\r\nwoods; two only remaining, who hastily lifted and carried away the\r\nwounded man, with loud wailings.\r\n\r\n\"There! we'se be clear on 'em for one bit,\" said Wilkins. \"Now's our\r\ntime to be off.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I should like much to have the axe,\" said Jack. \"Surely, Mr.\r\nArthur, there could be no harm in our taking the axe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And sure we will take it,\" exclaimed Gerald. \"All fair, you know,\r\ngeneral; the spoils of battle. The axe we may consider as prize-money.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does papa say? I leave the affairs of justice to him,\" said\r\nArthur, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Then, I think,\" said Mr. Mayburn, deliberately--\"Margaret, tell me if I\r\nam right--I think we, as Christians, should set a bad example to\r\nheathens, if we carried off their property.\"\r\n\r\nJack sighed, as he looked wistfully at the axe through an opening in the\r\nrock, and said,--\"It is tied to the handle with the stringy-bark, and\r\nthen it seems fixed with gum. I'm sure I could manage it, Mr. Arthur, if\r\nwe could only meet with the right stone; but this soft sandy rock is\r\ngood for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nBut now no more time was to be wasted. All marched along, more or less\r\nladen, headed by the two proud pioneers, and with their various packages\r\nwere safely got through the opening, and, to their great joy, once more\r\ntasted the blessing of fresh air. The pleasure of Mr. Mayburn, among the\r\nvariety of strange birds, was unbounded; and he was with difficulty\r\nprevailed on to move forwards, by the promise that, under more\r\nfavorable circumstances, they would all assist him in obtaining\r\nspecimens of the curious new species. But now expedition was prudent,\r\nand even imperative, and over the twice-trodden track they moved\r\nsilently and speedily till they reached the river.\r\n\r\nThere lay the frail bark Jack had contrived for crossing the river, and\r\nto each end of which he now attached one of his long coils of cord.\r\nThen, taking up two pieces of bark he had prepared for paddles, he\r\ncalled out,--\"Now, Master Hugh, just take hold of the coil at the prow;\r\nstep in, and we'll try her. Mr. Arthur and Wilkins must run out the\r\nstern-rope, and when we're over, Miss need have no fear.\"\r\n\r\nHugh, pleased to be selected for the first enterprise, leaped upon the\r\nslender canoe, and assisted Jack to paddle it across the rapid river;\r\nand when they safely reached the reedy bank, they unrolled their rope\r\nand secured the end, allowing the bark to be drawn back for Margaret,\r\nwho was the first single passenger. She accomplished her short voyage\r\nhappily, and, one at a time, the party were ferried over, bringing their\r\npackages with them. Then the ropes were cut away to be preserved, and\r\nthe light boat was suffered to drift down the stream; while the\r\nthankful, emancipated prisoners forced their way through the jungle of\r\nreeds and canes, and saw before them a bright-green luxuriant plain,\r\nspreading as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\n\"Musha!\" cried the Irish O'Brien, laughing joyfully. \"Sure I have come\r\non my own dear native bogs! the emerald plains of old Hibernia. No want\r\nof water now, my boys! Don't I hear it trickling beneath that bright\r\nturf, and won't we soak our boots well, my dears?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're bogs, sure enough,\" said Wilkins, \"and there's nought for it\r\nbut making a run. Slow and sure would be all wrong here, Mr. Arthur,\r\nwhere, if ye don't skip, ye must sink. Here, give me hold of yer hand,\r\nold woman, and lope on wi' me.\"\r\n\r\nJenny, to whom this invitation was addressed, was not accustomed to\r\n_lope_; but, half dragged and half lifted by Wilkins, she followed the\r\nrest, who were plunging, wading, running, or leaping, from one dry spot\r\nto another, over the luxuriant reedy marsh. The ground was thronged with\r\nthousands of wild fowls, especially with numbers of a graceful,\r\nbright-colored bird of the crane species, very attractive to Mr.\r\nMayburn. Clouds of troublesome insects filled the air; but life and\r\nliberty were in view, and small annoyances were disregarded; and, in the\r\nstrength of their substantial breakfast, the travellers pursued their\r\ntoilsome course across the marshy ground, till towards the end of the\r\nday, completely worn out, they cast themselves down to rest on the side\r\nof a firm hillock, beneath the shade of a lofty spreading tree, which\r\nhad the rare quality, in Australia, of a thick foliage of large leaves,\r\nand seemed to be a species of chestnut.\r\n\r\nThen the boys were put in requisition, and wild ducks procured for\r\nsupper; and, after this needful refreshment, they united in thanks to\r\nGod for their escape, and for the plenty that surrounded them, in a\r\nregion where the air was pure and healthy, and the animals innocuous;\r\nand this night they slept in the open air, fearless of disturbance.\r\n\r\nNext morning they proceeded on their way, after the boys had cut a\r\nstrong staff for each traveller; likening themselves to a party of\r\npilgrims with their long crooks. Still the same luxuriant vegetation lay\r\nbefore them, and still they continued the same arduous toiling over the\r\nsoft yielding soil, in which every footstep was buried; but their stout\r\nstaves and cheerful spirits carried them on for hours.\r\n\r\nThey continually saw the kangaroo bounding over the ground, and the\r\nactive opossum running up the tall gum-tree, or the pandanus, and were\r\nsorely tempted to pursue them.\r\n\r\n\"But only reflect, boys,\" said Arthur, \"on the imprudence of attempting\r\nto chase or shoot these animals now. It would be impossible for us to\r\ncarry more than our usual burdens over this heavy ground. Wait till we\r\narrive at our resting-place; and in the profusion of food around us, I\r\ntrust we shall not want. But observe, papa, we no longer see the range\r\nof sandstone hills lying to the east: we are certainly entering a new\r\nregion. That ridge before us will probably lead us from these tedious\r\nmarshes. We must try to toil up the ascent before we rest.\"\r\n\r\nIt was really a toil, in the heated atmosphere, to climb the\r\nbush-encumbered hills; but on reaching the summit, they were repaid by\r\nlooking down on a lovely valley.\r\n\r\nIt was on a lower level than that they had left, dotted over with green\r\nhills, and adorned with a forest-like scattering of majestic trees,\r\nbeneath which the grass was as rich as that of a cultivated meadow, and\r\nenamelled with brilliant flowers; while the scented jasmine blossoms\r\nclung round the taller trees, and filled the air with perfume. Parrots\r\nof every bright color played in the sunbeams, chattering in the most\r\ndistracting manner; while at intervals the discordance of their harsh\r\ncries was broken by the clear, bell-like notes of a musical warbler.\r\nNumerous silver streams might be seen at a distance, threading the\r\nplains, all on their way, Arthur observed, to swell some large river.\r\n\r\n\"Which we shall have to cross, most likely,\" said Hugh; \"so, Jack, we\r\nmust look about for materials for canoes again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am almost afraid to suggest it,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"but why should we\r\nleave this lovely, tranquil valley? Why should we not erect a simple\r\nhut, and dwell here in peace, abundance, and contentment, without toil\r\nand without care? What say you, Margaret?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be an idle and useless existence, papa?\" answered she.\r\n\r\n\"With not even wild beasts to hunt,\" added Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"No books to read, or horses to ride,\" said Hugh, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, it would be dowly enough a bit at first,\" said Wilkins, \"and then\r\nthem rogues would somehow make us out, and lead us a bonnie life.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it isn't fit, master,\" said nurse, indignantly, \"that decent women,\r\nlet alone Miss Margaret, should live their lives among heathens without\r\na rag to their backs. Here's poor Ruth breaking her heart to think of\r\nthem savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe, papa,\" said Arthur, laughing, \"the votes are against your\r\nresolution. For my own part, I cannot believe this rich and well-watered\r\nspot should be neglected by the natives. Depend on it, there are tribes\r\nnot far distant, that might annoy us if we were stationary, though I\r\ntrust we may not meet with many so ferocious as our last acquaintances.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am wrong, my son,\" replied Mr. Mayburn. \"I know my own weakness of\r\njudgment, and you see I have grace to acknowledge my blunder.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will descend into the valley now,\" said Arthur, \"and have a pleasant\r\nrest among this rich scenery. I hope that in a few days more we may\r\nreach some important river, which, if we can cross, we may at all events\r\nbe satisfied that we have left our old enemies behind us, though we\r\ncannot tell what new ones we may encounter.\"\r\n\r\nAfter many days' pleasant travelling over the well-watered and plentiful\r\nplains, they passed over a succession of green ridges, from the highest\r\nof which they had a view of a large river, certainly too wide to be\r\ncrossed by Jack's bark ferry-boat; and now speculations were awakened of\r\nboats, canoes, and easy voyaging.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you could make a bark canoe, Jack,\" said Hugh, \"that might be\r\npaddled well enough on a fair open river like that. Let us push forward\r\nand reconnoitre our chances of changing trudging for voyaging.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd have ye look about ye,\" said Wilkins, \"and mind yer steps. Yon's\r\njust t' place for 'em to gather. There'll be fish, and slugs, and\r\nsnakes, and all that sort of varmint. Why, bless ye, Jenny, woman, ye\r\nneedn't make such a face; I've seen 'em gobbling for hours at worms and\r\ngrubs, and then they'll suck lots of stuff out of them gum-trees. But I\r\nsay, what's yon black bit?\"\r\n\r\nThe \"black bit\" was a circle where a fire had been made not long before;\r\nnear the scorched spot lay half-finished spears, headed with sharp hard\r\nstones, of which some large slabs were piled near the place, and a\r\nfinished axe made from the same flint-like stone.\r\n\r\n\"I will not take their axe, Mr. Arthur,\" said Jack, \"because they have\r\nmanufactured it, and of course it is property like; but stones are\r\nnothing but stones all the world over, and free to anybody. So if you'll\r\nwait I'll sit down now and try to make an axe the model of that, and it\r\nwill be a shame if I cannot improve on it.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not denied the trial, and the result was, that Jack's axe was a\r\ncapital tool. Hugh had cut a handle from one tree, while Gerald\r\ncollected the gum oozing from another into a mussel-shell, and Jack\r\nselected the stone, and sharpened the edge on a block of sandstone, for\r\nthe blade. Then cutting a cleft in the handle, he inserted and tied the\r\nblade first, covering the joining with gum, and finally placing it in\r\nthe sun to dry. This success induced him to make a second axe, while the\r\nwhole party sat down to watch the interesting work.\r\n\r\nBut the uneasiness of Mr. Mayburn compelled them at length to leave a\r\nspot which was evidently a haunt of the natives. They continued to walk\r\ntowards the river over rich undulating ground covered with soft grass\r\nand the wild oats, the spring crop of which was here nearly ripe, and\r\nwas eagerly reaped to increase the provision store. Then they came on a\r\nswampy soil, which had been apparently overflowed by the river after the\r\nrains, and which was grown over by a perfect forest of mangroves,\r\nthickly peopled by mosquitos. It was with difficulty they could force\r\ntheir way through the trees to the river, which they judged to be about\r\nthree hundred yards across, flowing towards the west, and certainly too\r\ndeep to be forded. High cliffs shut out all view of the country on the\r\nopposite bank; and, much as it would have been desirable, Arthur feared\r\nthey would not be able to cross it except in canoes.\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be still better to sail up it,\" said Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"We have no canoes ready for such a purpose,\" answered Arthur, \"nor can\r\nwe yet begin to make one till our axes are sufficiently hardened to use\r\nwith safety. I propose that we should draw back beyond the marshy\r\nground, and follow up the course of the stream for one day at least. We\r\ncan all be at work collecting materials for boats.\"\r\n\r\nAny thing that gave them employment was acceptable to the boys, and they\r\nscampered from one tree to another to examine the quality or try to\r\ndiscover the species. The names they did not know, but were content to\r\ndistinguish the varieties as palm, oak, ash, cedar, or box, as they\r\nfancied they resembled those well-known trees. There were also the\r\nvarious gum-trees, the cabbage-palm, and a new and interesting object to\r\nMr. Mayburn, which he recognized from description,--the grass-tree,\r\n_Xanthorrhoea arborea_, the rough stem of which was ten feet in height\r\nand about two feet in circumference, and which terminated in a palm-tree\r\nform, with a cluster of long grass-like foliage drooping gracefully;\r\nwhile from the midst of the cluster sprang a single stamen of ten feet\r\nin height.\r\n\r\nMingled with the loftier trees was a sort of shrub, called by Wilkins\r\nthe _Tea Shrub_, the leaves of which, he told them, were used in the\r\ncolony as tea \"by them as liked such wishwash;\" and as Jenny and Ruth\r\ndeclared that they especially did like this \"wishwash,\" they gathered a\r\nquantity of the leaves to make the experiment of its virtues.\r\n\r\n\"It certainly belongs to a family of plants,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"which\r\nare all-important to the comfort and health of man; and though I do not\r\nknow the species, I should judge that an infusion of these leaves would\r\nproduce a wholesome, and probably an agreeable, beverage. The delicate\r\nwhite flowers are not unlike those of the tea-plant, certainly. But\r\npray, nurse, do not load yourself with too great a burden of the leaves,\r\nfor the shrub seems abundant, and we have already too much to carry in\r\nthis burning climate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nThe Tea-Shrub.--Another Canoe.--A Skirmish with the Natives.--Wounded\r\nHeroes.--An Attempt at Voyaging.--A Field of Battle.--The Widowed\r\nJin.--Wilkins's Sorrows.--Baldabella in Society.--The Voyage resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When are we to dine--or sup, rather--commander?\" said Hugh; \"I am so\r\nfamished, that I could eat one of those noisy cockatoos half-cooked, and\r\nMargaret looks very pale and weary.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must try to reach one of those green hills before us,\" said Arthur;\r\n\"we shall there be pretty certain to meet with some cave or hollow,\r\nwhere we can at least, stow our luggage; and then our cares and our\r\nsleep will be lighter; and as we go along, we will plunder some nests,\r\nthat Margaret may have eggs for her supper.\"\r\n\r\nThey took as many eggs and young birds as they required, and went on\r\ntill they found, among the hills, a hollow, capacious enough for a\r\nnight's lodging, and here they made a fire to cook the birds and to boil\r\nthe tea in a large mussel-shell. Ruth bemoaned again her awkwardness in\r\nbreaking the tea-cups; for now they had to sip the infusion of leaves\r\nfrom cockle-shells. Wilkins declined the luxury; but the rest enjoyed\r\nit, and declared that it not only had the flavor of tea, but even of tea\r\nwith sugar, which was an inestimable advantage.\r\n\r\n\"The plant is certainly saccharine,\" pronounced Mr. Mayburn.\r\n\r\n\"If it had only been lacteal too,\" said Hugh, \"we might have had a\r\nperfect cup of tea; but, papa, don't you think it has a little of the\r\naroma of the camomile tea with which nurse used to vex us after the\r\nChristmas feasts?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly not the genuine tea,\" answered Mr. Mayburn, \"the\r\npeculiar _Théa_ of China; but, doubtless, custom, would reconcile us to\r\nits peculiar flavor. We are surrounded with blessings, my children; and,\r\nabove all, have reason to be thankful for this sweet tranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nBut, just as he spoke, a distant _coo-ee_ from the woods proclaimed that\r\nthey were not out of the reach of the usual cares of life; and they\r\nhastily extinguished the fire and retired into the rocky shelter,\r\ntrusting that the darkness would prevent any discovery.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the daylight permitted him, Jack commenced to make the\r\ncanoes, which the dangerous vicinity of the natives rendered immediately\r\nnecessary. He roused his young masters, and Hugh and Gerald readily\r\nagreed to assist him; while Arthur made his way through the marsh to the\r\nside of the river, to select a convenient place for crossing it.\r\n\r\nBut he could see no possibility of landing on the opposite side, which\r\nwas guarded by perpendicular cliffs; and with much uneasiness he\r\nproceeded up the river in hopes of seeing an opening, to which they\r\nmight venture to cross. But after walking some distance, he thought it\r\nbest to return to the family, to propose that they should take a hasty\r\nbreakfast, and then move at once higher up the river, with watchfulness\r\nand caution, till they found the south banks more favorable for their\r\nattempt. There was no time to prepare tea, to the disappointment of the\r\nwomen: cold pheasant and cockatoo formed the breakfast. Then every one\r\nshouldered his burden, and the half-finished canoe was carried off, to\r\nbe completed under more favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nThey had walked without interruption for about two miles, when Margaret\r\nobserved to her brother Arthur, that an opening in the mangrove belt,\r\nthat ran along the banks of the river, would allow them to pass through,\r\nand afford them a safer and more advantageous track than their present\r\nexposed road. They could then select at once a shallow ford, or a flat\r\nstrand, on the opposite banks, to facilitate their crossing.\r\n\r\n\"Let us hasten over the swamp,\" said she, \"and secure this important\r\nadvantage. Dear papa is in continual alarm on these open plains, and I\r\nam quite losing my usual courage.\"\r\n\r\nBut as they drew near the opening to the water, Arthur, always\r\nthoughtful, felt a distrust of this singular interruption of the close\r\nentangled belt of the river. \"See here, Margaret,\" said he. \"Beneath the\r\nroots of this mangrove you have a perfect leafy arbor, with walls of\r\nbrilliant and fragrant creepers. In this pleasant bower I propose that\r\nwe should leave you and your maidens, my father, and all our property,\r\nwhile I lead my brave little band forward to reconnoitre before we\r\nproceed farther.\"\r\n\r\nThe tears stood in the eyes of the affectionate sister as she submitted\r\nto this prudent arrangement, and saw her dearly-loved brothers and their\r\nfaithful attendants prepare to set out on this service of danger.\r\n\r\n\"You can keep Ruth tied to one of these root columns,\" said Gerald,\r\n\"and gag her if she opens her mouth for a scream.\" Then making a grimace\r\nat the trembling girl, the laughing youth followed his friends.\r\n\r\n\"Gerald is not in earnest, my poor girl,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"but it is\r\nnevertheless important--nay, it is even imperative--that you should\r\npreserve absolute silence and immobility.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, Ruth,\" said Margaret, interpreting the order, \"you must sit\r\nquite still and hold your tongue, whatever may happen.\"\r\n\r\nThe little band marched on till they came to the opening of the road,\r\nand they now saw that the trees had been burned down, and the space\r\npurposely cleared. This was a startling sight, and before they could\r\ndetermine whether they should retreat or go forward, two natives\r\nappeared, approaching from the river-side, who no sooner set eyes on the\r\nformidable strangers, than they turned back hastily, and fled out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"Let us be prepared for defence,\" said Arthur; \"but, if possible, we\r\nwill meet them amicably. We will stand abreast in a line, and look as\r\nbold as we can.\"\r\n\r\nLoud yells were now heard, and soon a number of men confronted the small\r\nband, armed, as usual, with spears and throwing-sticks. They were\r\napparently much excited, though not painted for war. Arthur held out a\r\ngreen bough, and made friendly signs to them, continuing slowly to\r\napproach with his companions. For a minute or two the savages seemed\r\nstruck dumb and motionless with astonishment; then at once, they resumed\r\ntheir yells, leaping and whirling their spears in a threatening manner.\r\n\r\nStill undeterred in their wish for peace, the bold youths walked forward\r\ntill a spear flew amongst them and wounded Wilkins in the shoulder; who\r\nthen rushed forward, uttering a loud execration, and, with a huge club\r\nhe carried, struck the man who had thrown the spear senseless to the\r\nground. With frightful cries the natives flung more spears, while two of\r\nthem seized Wilkins; but he shook them off, as if they had been infants,\r\nand a volley of arrows from his friends directed the attention of the\r\nassailants from him; for every arrow had done execution. Wilkins then\r\ndrew back into the ranks and cried out, \"The rifle, sir! the rifle I\r\nsay, or we're all dead men!\"\r\n\r\nThere could indeed be no hesitation now, and Arthur fired one of his\r\nbarrels, intending the charge to pass over the heads of the enemy; but\r\none tall savage, who was leaping at the moment, received the shot in his\r\ncheek and head, and fell back into the arms of his companions, who bore\r\nhim off with dismal lamentations, and the rest followed hastily,\r\ncarrying away the senseless body of the man struck down by Wilkins.\r\n\r\nThey saw the savages force their way among the mangroves higher up the\r\nriver, and flee to the hills at the north; and, confident that they were\r\nat present in safety, Arthur anxiously reviewed his forces. Wilkins\r\nlooked very pale, and the spear was still sticking in his shoulder. Hugh\r\nwas stretching out a bloody hand, grazed somewhat severely, while Gerald\r\nwas waving triumphantly a large sombrero hat, woven of rushes by\r\nMargaret, and which now bore the noble crest of a spear which had\r\npierced, and carried it from his head, without injuring him.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, and won't the Lady Margaret bestow her glove on me,\" cried the\r\nwild boy, \"when she sees the honors I have brought away upon my knightly\r\nhelmet?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's been a close shave, young fellow,\" grumbled Wilkins, as he\r\nsucceeded with a groan, in drawing out the spear, which was followed by\r\nsuch a flow of blood, that Arthur thought it expedient to send the two\r\nboys with him to Margaret, that his wound might be dressed; while Jack\r\nand he hastily surveyed the field for which the party had fought and\r\nbled.\r\n\r\nA wide cleared space, sloping gradually to the river, was covered with\r\nvarious articles hastily abandoned. Clubs, boomerangs, heaps of wild\r\noats, with shells of the fresh-water mussel, and bones of fish. Large\r\nsheets of bark were placed round the spot, lined with grass, and\r\napparently used as beds. On these Jack cast a longing eye and said,\r\n\"Bark is cheap enough for them that have arms and knives, Mr. Arthur,\r\nand these come quite convenient for our boats just now; and no harm at\r\nall, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jack,\" answered Arthur, \"I think my father's scruples would not\r\noppose such an appropriation. But can we cross at once? There seems a\r\ntolerable landing-place nearly opposite.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must get the canoes ready for launching as fast as we can,\" replied\r\nJack; \"for we cannot do better than cross, to get out of the way of\r\nthose fellows, who will be sure to come back for their things. I'll just\r\nborrow this handy axe a bit: we can leave it behind us when we go.\"\r\n\r\nJack did not lose time; two of the bark beds were nearly transformed\r\ninto canoes by the time that Arthur had gone to the mangrove bower and\r\nbrought up all the party, with the unfinished canoe and the luggage.\r\n\r\nWilkins had his arm in a sling; but, though he certainly was suffering\r\nmuch, he made light of his wound, and Hugh had his hand bound up.\r\n\r\n\"This is a bad job, Mr. Arthur, for two to be laid off work when we're\r\nso sharp set,\" said Wilkins. \"I say, master, ye'll be forced to lend a\r\nhand,\" addressing Mr. Mayburn.\r\n\r\n\"My good man,\" replied he, \"I am willing to undertake any labor suited\r\nto my capacity; but I fear that I am but an indifferent mechanic.\"\r\n\r\nHugh and Gerald laughed heartily at the idea of papa with a hammer or an\r\naxe in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay, master,\" continued Wilkins, \"ye'll turn out a poor hand wi'\r\nyer tools, I reckon; but we'll learn ye to paddle these floats. I'se be\r\nfit for a bit work, 'cause, ye see, I've gettin my right arm; but that\r\npoor lad's quite laid off wi' his right hand torn. Gather up some of\r\nthem bits of bark to make paddles, Master Gerald.\"\r\n\r\n\"But no spears or weapons, Gerald,\" added Mr. Mayburn. \"We must not\r\ncarry off the property of these men, however inimical they are to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, begging yer pardon, master,\" replied Wilkins; \"there's them there\r\nspears as was stuck into us, we'se _surelie_ keep. Ye couldn't expect on\r\nus to send them things as rove our flesh off our bones back to 'em wi'\r\nour compliments and we were obliged to 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would certainly be an excess of honesty,\" said Arthur; \"and I\r\nthink with you, Wilkins, that we are entitled to the three spears that\r\ninjured us. For oars and paddles we have abundance of materials; I only\r\ngrieve that we have so few hands; but those are able and willing to\r\nwork; so let us hasten to get ready for the water.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours elapsed, however, before the three sound workmen were able to\r\nget all ready for the launch. In the mean time Wilkins and Hugh had\r\nsearched for the nests of the water-fowl, and taken a supply of young\r\nbirds, which the women had roasted for present and future provisions.\r\n\r\nFinally, three bark canoes were launched, each containing three persons,\r\nand the river was crossed in safety. Finding they could manage their\r\nlittle barks satisfactorily, they then agreed to row up the river as\r\nlong as it was practicable, which would, at all events, be less\r\nlaborious than walking with heavy burdens.\r\n\r\nWithout any alarms, except from seeing the smoke of distant fires on the\r\nshore they had left, they had passed through beautiful and diversified\r\nscenery for many miles, before the rapid close of the day warned them to\r\nland; and under an overhanging cliff on the south bank of the river,\r\nthey drew their canoes on shore, and encamped for the night.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with their pleasant and expeditious mode of travelling, they\r\nresumed their route next morning, and with the necessary interruptions\r\nof landing for supplies of the plentiful food that surrounded them, and\r\nfor needful rest, they continued for many days to voyage on the same\r\nbroad river; and though they occasionally saw smoke rising on the north\r\nside, they never met with any of the natives.\r\n\r\nBut at length this desirable tranquillity was disturbed; for one day\r\nthey were alarmed by sounds which they recognized as the angry yells of\r\nthe savages in their fury, and they knew some fearful contention was\r\ntaking place. The sounds proceeded from the south shore, and the river\r\nbeing at least two hundred yards broad at this part, they rowed to the\r\nnorth bank, in order to place a wide barrier between themselves and the\r\ncontending savages.\r\n\r\nLoud and louder grew the yells and cries when they drew near the scene\r\nof action, and curiosity induced them to rest on their oars, though they\r\ncould not see the combat; but gradually the sounds died away, and it was\r\nplain the contending parties had shifted their field of battle.\r\n\r\nAfter all had been quiet for some time, the boys begged earnestly that\r\nthey might be allowed to land and view the scene from whence these\r\ndiscordant cries arose; and, at last, leaving Jack, Hugh, and Mr.\r\nMayburn in charge of the canoes, Arthur with Gerald and Wilkins stepped\r\non shore, and making their way through the jungle, came on a\r\nwidely-spread, woody country, and saw, at no great distance, the\r\nscattered spears and clubs, which indicated that they were really upon\r\nthe field of battle.\r\n\r\nCautiously drawing near, they were shocked to meet with the bodies of\r\nnative men, transfixed by spears or destroyed by clubs. They gazed with\r\ndeep distress upon this sad sight, and were preparing to return, when\r\nthey were startled by hearing a low sobbing sound, followed by a shrill\r\nfaint cry, and searching round among the low bushes, they found a native\r\nwoman mourning over the body of one of the slain, while clinging to her\r\nwas a child about four years old. They approached hastily; but no sooner\r\ndid the woman see them, than she caught up her child, and would have\r\nfled, but Wilkins caught her arm, and pointing to the dead body, spoke\r\na few words to her in a jargon he had acquired during his residence in\r\nthe colony, which she seemed to understand, for she replied by some\r\nwords in a low, musical voice.\r\n\r\n\"It's the poor fellow's _jin_, ye see,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"His _jin_!\" said Gerald, laughing. \"What is a _jin_, Wilkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, all one as we should say his wife,\" replied Wilkins; \"and there's\r\nnought to laugh at, Master Gerald, for she seems, poor body! like to die\r\nhersel'. I'se a bad hand at talking in their way; ye see its mair like a\r\nbird chirruping nor our folks rough talk. My big tongue cannot frame to\r\nsing out like a blackbird. Now there was Peter----\"\r\n\r\nThe woman uttered a scream of terror as Wilkins pronounced the name, and\r\nlooking wildly round, she clasped the child, repeating distinctly, in\r\naccents of fear, \"Peter! Peter!\"\r\n\r\n\"She knows the rogue, I'll be bound!\" exclaimed Wilkins, endeavoring by\r\nwords and signs to obtain some information from her.\r\n\r\nThe woman pointed to the bleeding body at her feet, made a sign of\r\nstabbing, and again uttered in a vindictive tone, \"Peter!\" And on\r\nexamining the wounds of the corpse, Wilkins pointed out to Arthur that\r\nthey were not inflicted by the spear; for the man had been evidently\r\nstabbed to the heart by a sharp long-bladed weapon.\r\n\r\n\"That's been Peter's knife, I'd swear,\" said he, \"and the sooner we take\r\noff, the better, for he's an ugly neighbor;--poor body! she may well\r\nhave a scared look!\"\r\n\r\nAs they turned away, the woman, it appeared, had read pity in their\r\neyes, for she put her child into the hands of Arthur, and pointing\r\ntowards the west, again murmured the name of Peter, and signified that\r\nhe would return to murder her child and herself. Then lying down by the\r\nbody of her husband, she closed her eyes, indicating that she must die\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do, Mr. Arthur?\" said Wilkins, with tears on his rough\r\ncheeks; \"my heart just warks for her. But ye see--maybe as how master\r\nand miss wouldn't be for havin' such an a half dementet, ondecent body\r\namang 'em. What are we to do? Will ye just say? Sure as we're here, if\r\nwe leave her, that rascal will kill her; for ye see this dead fellow,\r\nhe's a big 'un, and likely he'd been again Peter, for he'd be like a\r\nhead amang 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let us take both the woman and her child,\" said Gerald. \"I will run\r\nforward to carry the child to Margaret and bring back some clothes for\r\nthe unhappy mourner;\" and without waiting for any sanction to his\r\nproceedings, he set off to the canoes with his prize. The alarmed woman\r\nstarted up, and looked anxiously after her child; but Wilkins made her\r\nunderstand she should also follow it, and she appeared satisfied. It was\r\nnot long before O'Brien returned, accompanied by Jenny, who brought a\r\nloose garment for the astonished woman, on whose scanty toilet the neat\r\nold woman looked with unqualified disapprobation, as she assisted in\r\narraying her more consistently with civilized customs; or, as she termed\r\nit, \"made her decent.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat uncertain of the prudence of making this addition to their\r\nparty, Arthur led the way to the boats, determined to consult his father\r\nand Margaret before the matter was determined. When the poor widow saw\r\nher child, dressed in a temporary costume of silk handkerchiefs, and\r\nholding Margaret's hand, in great contentment, her eyes glistened with\r\npleasure, and going up to Mr. Mayburn and Margaret, she threw herself\r\ndown on the strand, with her face to the ground, in an attitude of\r\nsubmission to her protectors.\r\n\r\n\"Poor creature,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"can we not restore her to her\r\npeople, Wilkins? You know something of her language--inquire her\r\nwishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can partly make out what she says, master,\" answered he; \"but I frame\r\nbadly in hitting on them singsong queer words. I take it, all her\r\nfriends have been killed right away, and she wants to stay wi' us.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's not a fit body to be company to Miss Marget,\" said nurse. \"You're\r\nlike to see that yourself, Wilkins.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I did see that, Mrs. Jenny,\" answered Wilkins, in a sharp tone,\r\n\"and I can't say I did see 't, it's wiser heads nor yours and mine as\r\nought to settle that. They say God made us all akin, and it's, maybe,\r\ntrue; but there's a strange deal of difference among us, nowadays, I\r\nconsate. Now, I'd not like to say that monkey-like, dark-avised poor\r\ncreater were born sister to my bonnie Susan Raine, as I ought to have\r\nwed, Mrs. Jenny, if I hadn't turned out a graceless.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is strange, Wilkins,\" said Margaret, \"that there was a fine,\r\nwell-behaved young woman, named Susan Raine, came over with us in the\r\n_Amoor_. She was with one of the emigrant families that Mr. Deverell\r\nbrought over from England.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's now better nor two years sin' I got a letter wrote to her, Miss,\"\r\nsaid Wilkins, greatly moved; \"but, like me, ye see, she's no scholar,\r\nand I heared nought from her, and I judged she'd wed another. Then I\r\ncared nought what came on me; and I consorted wi' Black Peter, and such\r\nchaps, and took any job of work to get away from yon gallows hole, when\r\nI found as how she'd not look at me. What like was she ye talked on,\r\nMiss?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was a fair, blue-eyed woman,\" answered Margaret, \"with yellow hair,\r\nand a bright color; and she spoke with a north-country accent.\"\r\n\r\n\"God forgive me all my sins, and bring me to that lass,\" said Wilkins,\r\n\"for I'se clear on 't, it was just my Sue. Mind ye tie me up, Mr.\r\nArthur, if that bad fellow, Black Peter, comes nigh us; I ken he'll want\r\nto nab me, and make a rogue on me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must ask God to give you strength to resist the temptations of such\r\na wretch,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"and your prayers will be heard. A great\r\nand good man has said of prayer, that it is\r\n\r\n    'A stream, which from the fountain of the heart\r\n    Issuing, however feebly, nowhere flows\r\n    Without access of unexpected strength.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, it seems a grand hymn,\" answered Wilkins; \"but I mind short prayers\r\nbest, and I'se try, master, to stick to 'em; for ye ken I'se but a soft\r\ngood-to-nought. But it may please God to make summut out on me yet; and\r\nwi' my own will, I'se niver leave ye.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of admitting the unfortunate woman among them was soon\r\ndecided. She crouched down in the stern of one of the canoes, holding\r\nthe child on her lap; and the river being fortunately very smooth, they\r\nwere enabled, though much crowded, to row off with the additional\r\nweight, being anxious to leave the spot before the natives should return\r\nto collect their spears. Besides, from the woman's words and signs they\r\ncomprehended that the victorious combatants would come back to take her\r\nlife and that of her child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nThe Mother and Child.--The Interior of the Country.--Another\r\nCataract.--The Pilgrim Troop.--The Difficult Ascent.--The Frilled\r\nLizard.--The Mountain-range.--The Kangaroo-chase.--The Pass of Erin.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was not till they had left the bloody field many miles behind\r\nthem that the woman recovered so far from her fear and stupefaction as\r\nto be able, by signs and half-understood words, to indicate to them that\r\nshe was friendless and homeless; and that Peter would kill her, the last\r\nof her family; and from the report of Wilkins, and other sources of\r\ninformation, Mr. Mayburn concluded that it was the custom of these\r\nnorthern people to live in families, or _clans_, rather than in tribes\r\nof many, one man being the head of the house, if we may so speak of\r\nthose who rarely have a house; but who live, like the beasts of the\r\nfield, in the open air, unless driven by the rains to take shelter in\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nFrom the woman they learnt that her name was Baldabella, and that of her\r\nchild was Nakinna. She was young, and her features were not unpleasant;\r\nher eyes were brilliant, and her voice soft and musical; nor was she\r\ndisfigured in any way, except that through the gristle of her nose she\r\nwore a fish-bone. The only garment she wore when she was discovered, was\r\na short cloak of the skins of opossums, sewed neatly together and pinned\r\nround her neck with a pointed bone. When they drew the canoes ashore at\r\nthe close of the day, on a narrow strand, Baldabella looked with wonder\r\non the arrangements made for the night, and the process of broiling\r\nbirds and roasting eggs at the fire, and drew away when invited to\r\npartake of the strangely-cooked food. Then she plunged her fingers into\r\nthe mud at the edge of the water, and soon went up to Margaret, and put\r\ninto her hand some small gray reptiles resembling slugs. Margaret shrank\r\nfrom the feast, shaking her head; but the woman put one into her own\r\nmouth, and swallowed it living with great relish, crammed one into the\r\nmouth of the child, and then returned to hunt for more.\r\n\r\nJenny held up her hands to express her abhorrence; Ruth stared at the\r\nwoman with terror, evidently looking on her as a kind of sorceress; and\r\nO'Brien laughed, as he said, \"Well, nurse, you need not be so much\r\ndisgusted; I dare say these snails taste as well as the ugly oysters\r\nwhich we are cannibals enough to swallow alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oysters, Master Gerald,\" answered nurse, reprovingly, \"are eat by\r\ndecent Christian people; and I see no harm in them, specially with\r\npepper and vinegar; but these things are varmint. Our ducks in England\r\nwould hardly touch them.\"\r\n\r\n\"A duck is not a fastidious feeder, nurse,\" said Margaret, \"and I would\r\nnot answer for its nicety in this matter. But this poor stranger prefers\r\nthe food she has been accustomed to, and we have no right to scoff at\r\nher taste. If she remain with us, no doubt, in time, she will conform to\r\nour habits.\"\r\n\r\nFor many days longer they continued their uninterrupted voyage up the\r\nriver, the widow becoming daily more at home with her protectors.\r\nMargaret clothed her in one of her old dresses, with which she was much\r\ndelighted, and in other respects she began to adopt the customs of her\r\nstrange protectors. She voluntarily discarded her nose ornament; she\r\nbathed herself and her child daily; she at length ate the same food, and\r\nimitated the manners of her friends.\r\n\r\nMargaret made light dresses for the little Nakinna, who rapidly caught\r\nthe English names for the objects around her, and from her the mother\r\nlearnt many words. But it was with deep concern that Mr. Mayburn saw the\r\nperfect indifference with which Baldabella regarded the religious\r\nworship of the family. She looked at first much astonished to see men\r\nand women kneel down, and to hear the solemn prayers pronounced by Mr.\r\nMayburn; but she soon turned carelessly away to dig for worms, or to\r\ncollect sticks for the fire.\r\n\r\nNot so the little Nakinna; for, after observing the devotions two or\r\nthree times, she walked up to Margaret, knelt down by her, lifted up her\r\nlittle hands, and seemed to listen with interest, though she could not\r\nyet understand. This act of docility and obedience was very gratifying\r\nto her kind instructress, who anxiously wished for the time when a\r\nmutual understanding might render it possible to communicate to these\r\nheathens a knowledge of the truth.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be possible, Wilkins,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"that these wretched\r\nnatives are so lost as not even to acknowledge a Supreme Being! not even\r\nto 'see God in clouds, and hear Him in the wind!' not to feel that there\r\nmust be a spiritual Ruler of the universe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, to my fancy, master,\" answered Wilkins, \"t' men folks isn't\r\naltogether dull chaps; but them poor jins just get all their sense\r\nknocked out on their heads. Poor bodies! they're no better off nor dogs\r\nnor asses. They work fra' morn to night, and hug heavy loads, and get\r\nkicks and short allowance for their pains.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a crushed, subdued look about the woman that rendered\r\nWilkins's assertion not improbable; but Margaret hoped that, by kind\r\ntreatment, the dormant intellect of the native might be developed.\r\n\r\nAt length the river became more difficult of navigation, the stream more\r\nrapid, and encumbered with fallen rocks, while rapids and falls\r\ncompelled them to land continually among thick jungles, or on the narrow\r\nstrand below precipitous cliffs. A mountain range was now visible before\r\nthem, and they concluded that they must soon reach the source of the\r\nfriendly river, when they should have to abandon the canoes for a less\r\nsafe and convenient mode of travelling.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot stand walking again,\" said Gerald. \"Couldn't we carry the\r\ncanoes forward awhile? and perhaps we might have the luck to fall in\r\nwith another river. What a grand thing it would be if we could find one\r\nflowing to the east or the south, that we might run easily down the\r\nstream without any hard work.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not very probable, Gerald,\" said Arthur, \"when we are yet so\r\nfar from the central part--what we may strictly term the interior of the\r\ncountry. But we will certainly spare ourselves the labor of carrying\r\naway our canoes when we leave the water; for there can be no difficulty,\r\nin such a richly-wooded region, in procuring materials for making\r\ncanoes, if we should need them. The noise of the waters seems to grow\r\nlouder, and I fear we are again approaching some great cataract, which\r\nwill probably, like the last we encountered, terminate all hopes of\r\nboating. I propose that we should at once make for yonder niche in the\r\ncliffs, and unlade the canoes. Wilkins and I will then row up as high as\r\nwe can in a lightened canoe, to endeavor to find out a mode of ascending\r\nfrom this deep gully.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we are to land,\" said Gerald, \"it will be easy enough to climb these\r\nwooded heights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy for you, my boy,\" said Arthur, \"especially if you had no\r\nencumbrances; but think of papa, and Margaret, Baldabella and her child,\r\nand all the bags and bundles which constitute our wealth. We must\r\nendeavor to discover an easier road, and in the mean time we will\r\ndisembark at this convenient spot.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn and Margaret remonstrated with Arthur for exposing himself\r\nand Wilkins to more danger than the rest, but were at length persuaded\r\nthat the expedition could be executed with more safety and success by a\r\nsmall party; and two of the canoes, with all the stowage, were therefore\r\nlanded in a shady nook, while the two men rowed on in the third boat.\r\nMargaret and her father waited uneasily, but the two boys amused\r\nthemselves by penetrating into the woods, to seek birds; Jack cut down\r\nbranches of trees, and formed them into spears, arrows, or forks; Jenny\r\nand Ruth cooked some birds, and Baldabella, armed with a spear, waded\r\ninto a shallow creek of the river near them, and speared two large fish,\r\nof the species they called the fresh-water cod. Still everybody thought\r\nthe hours went slowly, and were truly glad to see the light canoe\r\ngliding swiftly down the stream with Arthur and Wilkins, who drew it\r\nashore; then Arthur said,--\r\n\r\n\"If possible, we must make our way along the banks, for the river is\r\neven now dangerous of ascent, and at no great distance our voyage would\r\nbe entirely arrested by a cataract, similar to that we encountered soon\r\nafter our reaching the mainland. Wilkins and I, after mooring our canoe\r\nto the mangroves, climbed to the heights, and found we were then only at\r\nthe base of successive ranges of hills, which terminated in high-peaked\r\nmountains, apparently inaccessible. From these hills flowed many\r\nrivulets, which unite at the grand cataract and form this river.\"\r\n\r\nTo make further progress in their journey, it was therefore necessary\r\nthat they should reach the country above the high rocky banks of the\r\nriver, and Arthur said that on their return they had noticed one place\r\nwhere it might be possible for the whole party to ascend; though the\r\npath must necessarily be one of difficulty.\r\n\r\nThey dined on roast birds and broiled fish, and then began an active\r\npreparation for walking. Every thing that was worth transporting was\r\nreduced to as small a compass, and made as portable as possible; the\r\ncanoes were reluctantly abandoned, and then the long train, headed, as\r\nusual, by Arthur, set out; Baldabella quietly taking her place in the\r\nline, bearing her child on her shoulder, and resting on her long\r\nfish-spear.\r\n\r\n\"I could fancy we were the Israelites, wandering in the wilderness,\"\r\nsaid Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"You will please to recollect, Gerald,\" said Hugh, \"that the Israelites\r\nexceeded us in number in a _trifling_ degree, extending to hundreds of\r\nthousands, we are told; and then, though Arthur is doubtless a clever\r\nfellow, he cannot be such a guide as the wise and gifted Moses.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Israelites had a more infallible Guide,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"than\r\neven their great leader Moses, until by discontent and disobedience,\r\nthey rejected the Holy One. Let us take warning, my children, lest we\r\nshould, in like manner, forget the certain protection which our Heavenly\r\nFather extends to all his faithful people.\"\r\n\r\nThey slowly wound along the narrow strand, sometimes sunk in mud,\r\nsometimes climbing over mounds of pebbles or piles of drift-wood,\r\nanxiously examining the thick matted woods which covered the precipitous\r\ncliffs, and even occasionally intercepted their path. For some time they\r\ndespaired of finding any spot favorable for the purpose of reaching the\r\nlevel ground; till Arthur pointed out the place which he had previously\r\nnoticed, where the banks had given way, and a great fall of rocks had\r\nformed a sort of sloping staircase, less encumbered with the brushwood,\r\nand less abrupt than they had expected.\r\n\r\n\"If we ever succeed in reaching the height,\" said Arthur, \"this must be\r\nour path. The strong must lead the way, and aid in drawing up the\r\nfeeble. These drooping creepers will be convenient to cling to, that we\r\nmay not lose the ground we have made. Give me your hand, Meggie.\"\r\n\r\nWith many a slip downwards, a scream, and a rending of garments, the\r\nwomen were dragged up through the almost perpendicular wood. Baldabella\r\nalone, erect and firm in foot, despised assistance. She disencumbered\r\nherself of all loose drapery, and clasping her child, she stepped among,\r\nunder, or over the bushes, with speed and safety; and long before the\r\nmen had reached the height, she had quietly resumed the garb of her\r\nsex, and was seated to wait for the arrival of the less-practised\r\nclimbers. They were scarcely all assembled, weary and tattered, at the\r\nhead of the cliff, when Ruth, who was the last, suddenly uttered a\r\npiercing shriek, and rushed down into the matted bush again, pursued by\r\nJack, who captured and brought her back, struggling and exclaiming\r\nagainst his interference.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack, man, let me be,\" cried she; \"didn't thou see 't? It's an\r\nuncanny place, this. I seed it mysel', Jack; it were a little auld\r\nfairy, grinning at me, wi' a long tail.\"\r\n\r\nJack was too enlightened to have any dread of a fairy, even with a long\r\ntail; and he persisted in bringing up Ruth, pale and trembling, to the\r\nrest of the party, though she continued to cry out, \"Yonder she sits!\r\nJack, honey! keep out on her way; she'll charm thee.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the boys heard Ruth's story of the tailed fairy, they ran\r\nwith great glee to the spot she pointed out, and there, perfectly calm\r\nand immovable, they beheld the old fairy, in the form of a very\r\nextraordinary lizard. It was seated on its tail, apparently undismayed\r\nby the presence of observers; and Mr. Mayburn was called to the spot to\r\nexamine the new discovery. The length of the body might be five inches,\r\nbut the tail was twice that length; the color yellowish brown and black.\r\nIt was scaly and frightful, and its human-like face, prominent eyes,\r\nlong claws, and plaited ruff, might well terrify the ignorant and\r\nsuperstitious.\r\n\r\n\"I recognize the creature,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"from the description\r\ngiven by more than one traveller, to be the _Chlamydosaurus Kingii_,\r\npeculiar to Australia. The frill which surrounds its head, extending\r\neven to the chest, and folded in plaits, points out the distinct\r\nspecies. This ruff is a curious membrane, which can be expanded, by\r\nmeans of slender transverse cartilages, at the will of the animal, when\r\nit is roused to anger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then observe, papa,\" said Gerald, \"how indignant it is at our\r\nimpertinent remarks. See how it spreads its broad frill, and shows its\r\nsharp teeth, as if it wished to bite us. Must I knock it down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly, Gerald,\" answered Mr. Mayburn, \"my curiosity would overcome the\r\nfeelings of humanity, and I should be tempted to desire to obtain the\r\ncreature; but I see Arthur shakes his head at the suggestion. And, after\r\nall, we have no right to slaughter the unoffending animal.\"\r\n\r\nBaldabella, on whose ears Mr. Mayburn's words fell in vain, looked with\r\nglittering eyes on the reptile, and raising her spear said in her new\r\nlanguage, \"Baldabella eat him.\" But the lizard, with an instinct of\r\ndanger, ran swiftly up the tree, assisted by its hooked claws, and\r\nescaped the blow. When far above any fear of attack, it again calmly sat\r\ndown, looking down on the baffled woman with a frightful sarcastic grin.\r\n\r\n\"There now!\" said Ruth, \"didn't I tell ye she were uncanny? She heard\r\nall 'at were said, as sure as we're here.\" For Ruth's conviction of its\r\nsupernatural rank was not to be shaken by Mr. Mayburn's scientific\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying their curiosity in looking at the frilled lizard,\r\nArthur called on his forces to resume their march. Before them now lay\r\nrich green hills, rising gradually above each other, and intersected by\r\nclear streams, flowing into the river they had left. These hills were\r\nthe first steps to mountains which rose, high and rugged, even to the\r\nclouds. The hills, though tedious, would not be very difficult to\r\nascend; but how to pass the mountains they could not yet judge.\r\n\r\nThe mountain-range ran, as far as the eye could reach, from north-east\r\nto south-west, and completely intercepted them in the road they desired\r\nto pursue. To pass them, if possible, must therefore be their aim; or a\r\nvast deal of time must be lost in making a circuitous course.\r\n\r\n\"We will ascend the hills, at all events,\" said Arthur, \"and look round\r\nus. We may, perhaps, find some natural pass. We might even try a\r\nkangaroo-path, which must be found, for, see what herds of the animals\r\nare bounding along under the lofty trees on the hills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do let us have a kangaroo-hunt, Arthur!\" exclaimed Hugh. \"We are\r\nhungry, and kangaroo meat would fill us; and therefore, papa, we have a\r\nright to kill and eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see ye set about it,\" said Wilkins. \"They're sharper fellows nor\r\nye think on, them kangaroos, my lad. They're a match for most folks,\r\nbarrin' ye have dogs, or follow them up till they fall tired, and\r\nthat'll maybe, not be for half a day. I ken a good deal of\r\nkangaroo-hunting; but I'se not clear that them there chaps is so shy as\r\ndown-country beasts; ye see, they'll niver like have clapped eyes atop\r\non a man, and they'll not ken man's crafty ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the disgrace of human nature,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"what Wilkins\r\nsuggests is true: wherever he is recognized by the brute creation, they\r\ninstinctively\r\n\r\n    'Shun the hateful sight of man.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said Gerald, \"that is, I suppose, because the ignoble fears\r\nthe noble--the coward the brave.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you may add, Gerald, the slave his tyrant,\" continued Mr. Mayburn.\r\n\"It is ever thus with\r\n\r\n              'Man, proud man!\r\n    Dressed in a little brief authority.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But, papa,\" said Hugh, \"we are in need of food, and you must allow that\r\nit is more humane to destroy one kangaroo than a dozen cockatoos or\r\npheasants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with Hugh, papa,\" said Margaret. \"We will, if possible, content\r\nourselves to-day with taking one life.\"\r\n\r\nArmed with spears and throwing-sticks, bows and arrows, and one\r\nboomerang which Baldabella had found, and which no one but herself could\r\nyet use, the hunters preceded Mr. Mayburn and Margaret. By the\r\ndirections of the experienced Wilkins, they spread along in a line, to\r\nguard the foot of the hill; for he said the animal always took a\r\ndownward course when it was alarmed, for, as its fore-feet never touch\r\nthe ground in its greatest speed, it has more time in a descent to draw\r\nup the hind legs, to make the immense spring, than it could have with an\r\nascent before it.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the timid animals seen the strange forms of the hunters\r\nthan they started off with such incredible speed, that no one\r\nunacquainted with their habits could have believed that their flight was\r\na series of jumps, and that their fore-feet never touched the ground. In\r\ntheir confusion, some of the animals tried to penetrate the rank of the\r\nhunters, while some fled to the right or to the left. The spears and\r\narrows showered amongst them, and more than one beast carried off the\r\nweapon sticking in him. But it was the boomerang of Baldabella which,\r\nafter complicated and mysterious evolutions, struck and stunned a large\r\nanimal, which Wilkins presently despatched with his knife.\r\n\r\nArthur then recalled the hunters, saying, \"We will have no more\r\nslaughter. This large animal will supply us with as much meat as we can\r\nconsume while it remains fresh, and it would be wanton to slay more.\"\r\n\r\nThe rear rank then joined them. The body of the kangaroo, suspended on a\r\nlong pole, was shouldered by Wilkins and Jack, and the march was\r\nresumed. They ascended and descended several hills, till night and\r\nfatigue compelled them to rest in a little hollow, where a cooking-fire\r\nwas made, and they supped with great enjoyment on venison steaks; and,\r\nlike the early inhabitants of the world, before luxury and artificial\r\nwants had enervated them, they slept beneath the canopy of heaven, among\r\nthe everlasting hills.\r\n\r\n\"Get up, Arthur,\" cried Hugh, early next morning. \"Get up, and come to\r\nsee our mountain-pass. Gerald discovered it, and therefore we propose to\r\nname it the 'Pass of Erin.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nThe Dangerous Pass.--The Coupled Travellers.--The Mountain\r\nLabyrinth.--The Emancipation of Ruth's Chickens.--A Combat\r\n_à l'outrance_.--The Ornithorhyncus.--The Forest in the\r\nMountains.--Singing Birds.--The Laughing Jackass.\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur was soon alert, and followed the boys, who led him up the side of\r\nthe next high hill and along the ridge for about three hundred yards to\r\nthe south west, and then pointed out to him a narrow rent or gorge in\r\nthe mountain, lying far below the hill on which they stood; but from\r\nthis hill a gradual ascent, formed by fallen rocks, made a rude path to\r\na narrow shelf or terrace which they now saw far above them, and which\r\nran along the precipitous side of the rocky wall. Arthur shuddered as he\r\nsaid, \"Is that narrow terrace passable, do you think, Gerald?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" answered he; \"Hugh and I had a run along it before we woke\r\nyou, and it is not half so bad as it looks. We shall manage very well if\r\nwe go 'goose-walk;' but I think it would not be safe for two abreast. To\r\nbe sure, it is rather confusing to look down into the depths below; but\r\nwe must give them all a caution, and I think it would be better to\r\nblindfold Ruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing for us but to try it,\" said Arthur. \"Let us return to\r\nbreakfast before we set out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we might as well reduce the bulk of the kangaroo,\" said Hugh, \"for\r\nit will be awkward to carry it along our pass.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the plan was fully arranged, it was judged expedient to cut up\r\nthe kangaroo, and only carry away sufficient for another day's\r\nconsumption. Even the useful skin was reluctantly abandoned, as Arthur\r\nknew well they must have no unnecessary encumbrance. Ruth could not,\r\nhowever, be persuaded to leave her pet fowls, but resolutely set out\r\nwith her basket on her arm.\r\n\r\nThen, after beseeching a blessing on their perilous journey, they\r\nmarched forward, and gradually ascending the hills, they reached the\r\nnarrow path that skirted the mountain. This natural shelving was\r\nscattered over with loose stones, and occasionally broken away till a\r\nledge of only about five or six feet was left for them; but the creeping\r\nplants that covered the rock enabled the timid to grasp a kind of\r\nsupport on one hand, as they moved cautiously along the unequal and\r\nperilous path. Below this terrace yawned a deep gully, that formed the\r\nbed of a stream, which at all seasons washed its sides. This stream was\r\nnow shallow, and moved sluggishly; but rugged crags, and torn-up trees,\r\nlying in the bed, showed that raging torrents must pour into it after\r\nthe rainy season.\r\n\r\nFrom the interstices of the bush-covered rocks sprang the gray-leaved\r\ngum-tree, the elegant casuarina, and a bright-leaved tree resembling the\r\nbox, but lofty and strong. Among these trees parrots and cockatoos\r\nchattered incessantly, and on the gum-trees hundreds of little active\r\nopossums sported with all the playfulness of monkeys; and Mr. Mayburn\r\nwas so interested in watching them hang from the branches, suspended by\r\ntheir curved tail, to rifle the nests of the birds, or feed on the\r\nnumerous insects round them, that Arthur, in alarm, stepped back to hold\r\nhis father by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what we must do, Arthur,\" said Gerald; \"we must be linked in\r\ncouples, as the travellers on the Alps are; then, if one makes a false\r\nstep, there's a chance for his mate to draw him up.\"\r\n\r\n\"No bad plan, Gerald,\" answered Arthur; \"but we must take care to couple\r\nwith judgment. The prudent or brave must take charge of the rash or the\r\ntimid. I will take papa; Jack, his unlucky sister; Hugh, Margaret, or,\r\nmore correctly, Margaret must take Hugh; Wilkins will take charge of\r\nnurse; and you, the neglected proposer of this wise measure, cannot\r\nprofit by it, unless you will submit to be guided by Baldabella, who\r\nseems to trip along with her lively burden unapprehensive of danger.\"\r\n\r\nHugh preferred to walk unfettered; and Arthur had no fears for the\r\nnative woman, whose firm and steady step showed that she had been\r\naccustomed to such rough and scrambling paths.\r\n\r\nArthur, who was the first of the line, now became uneasy, as, on looking\r\nbefore him, he remarked that, as far as the eye could reach, there\r\nappeared to be no termination to the mountain wilderness. He could have\r\nfancied that a labyrinth of broken, precipitous, lofty, and interminable\r\nrocks shut them completely from the world. It was a bewildering\r\nprospect, and even the strong heart of Arthur almost failed him, and his\r\nhead whirled at the sight of such stupendous and uncertain difficulties.\r\n\r\nA scream from Ruth recalled him to his immediate duties, and on turning\r\nround he saw her much-valued basket of poultry bound down the precipice\r\nover the bushes, till it rested on a lower ledge, some hundreds of feet\r\nbeneath them, where it flew open, and the fowls, uninjured by their\r\ninvoluntary flight, fluttered from their prison, and began calmly to\r\npeck about for food; while the little bantam cock proclaimed his liberty\r\nby shaking his plumes and uttering his conceited hoarse crow.\r\n\r\n\"They are settlers now, Ruth,\" cried Gerald, laughing; \"the first\r\ncolonists--regular squatters. How astonished future travellers will be\r\nwhen they make the curious discovery: a species of bird remarkably like\r\n_Gallus Barndoorii_. What grand names they will bestow on them! and\r\nwrite long papers, and puzzle ornithologists.\"\r\n\r\nBut the patriarch of this new species was not allowed to squat among the\r\naborigines with impunity; his triumphant notes were answered by a crow\r\nof defiance in a less familiar tone from a splendid cock pheasant, which\r\npounced down on the new comer with a furious peck, that the true-trained\r\nEnglish bird, notwithstanding his foreign ancestry, could not brook. The\r\nbrave little bantam retaliated boldly, and a furious combat ensued,\r\ncausing even the English hens to raise their heads from their pleasant\r\nfeast, and appear somewhat interested in the event; while Ruth shrieked,\r\n\"He'll kill him! Jack, honey! throw a stone at him! drive him off!\r\nChuck! chuck!\"\r\n\r\nBut though Ruth's familiar cry failed to separate the combatants _à\r\nl'outrance_, the pleased hens recognized the well-known call, and\r\nresponded to it by fluttering and scrambling up the mountain side, to\r\npartake of the scattered grain; and in the fulness of their feast, they\r\nwere easily captured, and stowed in separate bags and pouches, till a\r\nnew dwelling could be made for them.\r\n\r\nThen the little feathered hero below, having vanquished and left his\r\nantagonist for dead, perched for a moment on the pinnacle of a shattered\r\nrock, and crowed triumphantly, as if to defy the whole race of native\r\nbirds; after which demonstration, he leisurely followed his female\r\nfriends up the steep, to share their feast and their captivity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the alarm and delay caused by this accident, there was\r\nsomething amusing about it that was not without its beneficial effects.\r\nRuth continued to lament the loss of her basket; but Jack scolded her\r\nseriously for her foolish fears and awkwardness, which were the sole\r\ncause of the loss. He declared the fowls were absolute pests, and wholly\r\nuseless in a region where birds and eggs dropped into your hands; but\r\nhis remonstrances having produced tears of penitence and promises of\r\namendment, he relented, and promised to make for her a coop, or cage, of\r\ncane, which would be easier to carry than the basket, and afford more\r\nair to the unfortunate prisoners.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering for two days along their frequently dangerous, and\r\nalways difficult, aerial pathway, resting only when they came to some\r\nrocky hollow, they began to pine for a less-hazardous road; and they now\r\nperceived that, with the usual caprice of Australian rivers, the stream\r\nin the narrow bed below them had disappeared, though slender rills\r\ncontinually fell from the mountains, but subsided into bogs, or formed\r\npools below. They therefore resolved, if they could safely accomplish\r\nit, to descend to the bed of the river; and endeavor to extricate\r\nthemselves from the rocky maze in which they seemed hopelessly involved.\r\n\r\nAfter another day's travelling, they fancied the descent appeared more\r\npracticable than it had yet been since they set out on the shelving\r\nterrace, and it was decided to make the trial. The first step would\r\ndecidedly be the most difficult. About twelve feet below them another\r\nshelf of rock projected, wider than that on which they now stood; but\r\nhow to reach it was a puzzling question, for the descent was\r\nperpendicular, and quite overgrown with thorny bushes.\r\n\r\n\"If you will help me, Master Hugh,\" said Jack, \"I think we may manage\r\nit. We must just cut down the bushes into steps like for them that feel\r\ntimid.\"\r\n\r\nEmployment was the grand need of the active boys, and to clear a passage\r\nas low as they could reach, and then step down on the bushes to work\r\nbelow, was a pleasant amusement. The stone axes were now found to be\r\nperfectly serviceable, and they soon cut six clearances, each two feet\r\ndeep, graduating like a staircase, of which the matted brush formed the\r\nsteps, which reached to the lower terrace; and down the staircase the\r\nagitated females were, one after another, assisted, and safely placed on\r\nthe broad shelf.\r\n\r\nThis was a decided victory, and they now saw, to their great\r\nsatisfaction, that the lower descent sloped so much, from accumulated\r\nrocks and drift-wood, that by clearing the way with the axes, they\r\neasily reached the comparative security of the muddy bed of the vanished\r\nriver. They looked round on the immense walls which inclosed them with\r\nsome dismay; then Gerald said,--\r\n\r\n\"Now, Meggie, we only want the great rains to come on, and then we shall\r\nhave some notion of the situation of sinful man in the Deluge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust, my dear boy,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"that you do not allude to\r\nthat fearful judgment with levity. And surely, Arthur, we are not near\r\nthe time of the terrific tropical rains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Usually, papa, I believe the heaviest autumnal periodical rains are in\r\nFebruary and March,\" said Arthur. \"We are now in the midst of summer;\r\nstill I must confess I have read of continued rains, even at this\r\nseason; but I trust we shall be in a safer locality before such trying\r\nweather comes on. We are certainly progressing in the way we wish to go;\r\nbut the immense extent of the mountain-range is extraordinary.\r\nFortunately, we are not in a desert, we are surrounded by plenty, and as\r\nfar as we have yet penetrated, ferocious animals seem unknown; and more,\r\nferocious man rarely encountered. I only fear for your strength, dear\r\npapa, and for that of dear Meggie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not for us, Arthur,\" answered Margaret; \"you know I am naturally\r\nstrong; and God has given renewed life and health to dear papa. His\r\ndelight in these new and varied scenes of Nature makes every toil light\r\nto him. Observe him now, pausing and contemplating something at yon\r\nlarge pond; let us join him. Now, papa! what is the new discovery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful, my children,\" said he. \"Behold this marvellous new creature.\r\nUndoubtedly it must be the _Ornithorhyncus paradoxus_, the duck-billed\r\nPlatypus, which I should have recognized, from the numerous sketches I\r\nhave seen; and my warmest hopes are fulfilled in the happiness of really\r\nlooking on the rare animal in its native wilds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is't a duck, think ye, Miss Marget?\" asked Ruth, with a kind of awe.\r\n\r\n\"Has a duck four legs, Ruth?\" asked Gerald. \"Has it fur on its back,\r\nand a broad finny tail? No, Ruth, this is not a strange fowl, but a\r\nstrange beast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"there are irreconcilable\r\ncircumstances in such a decision. This animal, if we rank it among the\r\nmammalia, belongs to no order yet named, but stands alone. Quadruped it\r\nis, certainly; web-footed, certainly; ovo-viviparous, certainly, as the\r\neggs are hatched before birth, and the young then suckled, like the\r\nmammalia. Feeding on worms and grubs, like the duck; sleeping rolled up,\r\nlike the hedgehog; playful as the monkey, and harmless as the dove;--we\r\ncannot but look with astonishment and admiration on this remarkable\r\ncaprice of Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're ugly beasts, that I'll say,\" was Jenny's remark, \"and not half\r\nso good as a duck for such as us; but I'se warrant them poor heathens\r\neat 'em as we would a roast goose.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the platypus, which they now saw at every pool as they\r\nproceeded, they walked on till the ravine gradually became wider, but\r\nthe mountain-line still spread on each side. Soon after, the pools\r\ndisappeared, and rich grass supplied their place. Wild and wonderful was\r\nnow their daily journey, for before them lay immense untrodden forests,\r\ninclosed between lofty cliffs, which rose to the clouds, and the\r\ntravellers felt inspired with awe as they looked round on the majesty of\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nYet the softer features of loveliness were not absent; every step was on\r\nsome beautiful, usually some quite new, plant, and the lofty forest\r\ntrees were of species now first seen, and were garlanded round with\r\nflowering creepers of the most brilliant dyes; while the rich perfume\r\nof the jasmine, and the heliotrope-like odor of the golden-blossomed\r\nacacia filled the air. Bright _orchidæ_, unnamed and unknown, masses of\r\nferns of unexampled beauty, were scattered round this vast conservatory\r\nof nature; and amidst all this profusion, thousands of birds whistled,\r\nchattered, warbled, and uttered the startling foreign notes which assure\r\nyou that you are in a strange land.\r\n\r\nThere was the sweet-voiced bell-bird, a pretty little creature, whose\r\nnotes ring with a silver sound; there was the pert pied bird, which\r\nmight seem really a magpie, if it were not tailless, which has a low\r\nflute-like song, swelling like the organ; whence it is named by the\r\ncolonists the organ-magpie; and as each strain of these warblers died\r\naway, the loud, hoarse, derisive notes of a curious bird, resembling\r\nnone of the known species of the world, seemed to ridicule the musical\r\nperformers.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, papa,\" said Hugh, \"this must be the 'laughing jackass,' of\r\nwhich we have read an account. Do you hear the regular 'Ha! ha! ha!'\r\nfrom which he derives his name, and which sounds so strangely when\r\nmingled with the notes of the warblers? But now he has roused all the\r\ncockatoos and parrots, who are screaming their jargon above all other\r\nsounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just listen, Hugh,\" said Gerald, \"those jackass birds are surely\r\nblowing a penny trumpet. Did you ever hear such a noise--laughing,\r\nbraying, trumpeting? you might fancy you were at a country fair. How\r\nRuth does stare! I say, Ruth, what do you think of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will they be Christians, Master Gerald?\" asked the trembling girl.\r\n\r\n\"Hopeless heathens, Ruth,\" answered the wild boy; \"feathered donkeys,\r\nflying punches, instinctive mocking-birds, repeating sounds which they\r\nhave never heard. See, papa, there is one of the jolly fellows, perched\r\non yon gum-tree. What a monstrous beak he has!\"\r\n\r\n\"I contemplate the bird with great interest, my boy,\" answered Mr.\r\nMayburn. \"It has been classed with the Halcyons by naturalists, and\r\nnamed _Dacelo gigantea_; yet, in its social habits, and flexible and apt\r\norgans of voice, it seems rather to resemble the jay. It is somewhat\r\nremarkable that amidst the gorgeously-attired birds that surround it,\r\nthis rarely-gifted bird wears a garb so simple and unadorned. You\r\nobserve that it frequents the gum-tree, and its sombre plumage,\r\nassimilating so happily with the gray foliage of the tree, is at once a\r\nprotection and a distinction. How rejoiced I should be, my dear boy, if\r\nwe could make a complete collection of these rare creatures; but the\r\ndifficulties of transporting them safely in our journey are\r\ninsurmountable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, sir,\" replied Gerald, \"till we catch our quaggas; then Jack will\r\nmake us a wagon, which we can convert into a menagerie, filled with\r\ncurious animals, and drawn by our own beasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"The quagga is not a native of Australia, Gerald,\" replied Mr. Mayburn;\r\n\"nor does the country, happily, produce any of the large and fierce\r\nquadrupeds. We must not dare to think of any vehicle for travelling; yet\r\nmany hundred miles separate us from the useful animals of our dear\r\nfriends the Deverells; and my heart fails me when I reflect on the\r\nimprobability of our ever reaching them.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret sighed as she said, \"And I too, dear papa, cannot help many\r\nidle wishes that we were come to open plains, and more direct paths.\r\nThese lovely wilds of Nature, forests and mountains, are very charming;\r\nbut they seem too romantic and unreal to be satisfactory. If we were to\r\nkeep a journal, and publish it hereafter, we should, I fear, be\r\nridiculed for inventing fairy tales.\"\r\n\r\n\"In truth, Margaret,\" answered her father, \"fairy tales were not\r\noriginally mere inventions of the imagination. They were the offspring\r\nof the experience of observing travellers over lovely untrodden wilds\r\nlike these. And what are the miraculous transformations they describe\r\nbut such as might really happen--the ingenious contrivances of man when\r\ndestitute of all the resources of civilized life? Has not Jack\r\ntransformed a flint-stone into an axe? and have we not cups and plates\r\nwhich were once the abodes of the shell-fish? Difficulties originate\r\nmiraculous efforts, and man is indebted to the good fairies, Necessity\r\nand Ingenuity, for many of his comforts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, dear papa,\" said Arthur; \"and the fairy Necessity now calls\r\non us peremptorily to escape from these forests, where I have twice\r\nduring this day heard the _coo-ee_ of the natives, though at a\r\nconsiderable distance before us. I have been for some time anxiously\r\nexamining the south side of the gorge for any outlet which may enable us\r\nto turn away from their haunts.\"\r\n\r\nThey had been making their way for some hours along the southern\r\nextremity of the forest, still hemmed in by the high rocks, when Gerald,\r\ncreeping into a narrow cleft, declared that he had found a tunnel, and\r\ncalled on Hugh to assist him in exploring it. Fearful that they should\r\nbewilder themselves in the recesses of the mountains, Arthur proposed\r\nthat all the party should enter the opening, which was a cavern of great\r\nheight and space, where they might remain till he and his brothers\r\npenetrated further into the rocks. They lighted some dry branches for\r\ntorches, and set out, satisfied that the rest would be in safety in this\r\nsecure retreat.\r\n\r\nThe boys found this tunnel descend gradually: sometimes it was narrow\r\nand low, sometimes wide and encumbered with fallen fragments of rock;\r\nstill, it was airy, and they were able to pass on, till they concluded\r\nthey must have walked half a mile. They were then so desponding that\r\nthey thought of turning back, but at length a glimmering of light\r\nsatisfied them that there must be another outlet, and they took courage\r\nto proceed, till they reached a matted thicket of brushwood through\r\nwhich they forced their way, and then had the pleasure of seeing the sky\r\nabove their heads, though they were still in a very narrow gully. It\r\nseemed to be the dry bed of a rivulet, choked up with stones and torn-up\r\nbushes. Before them rose another line of bush-covered mountains, but not\r\nso lofty or precipitous as those they had left behind.\r\n\r\n\"Is it worth while,\" said Hugh, \"to drag the whole party through that\r\ngloomy subterranean passage, to bring them into this glen, which seems\r\nperfectly barren and lifeless? I am of opinion that we were better in\r\nour old forest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait for my decision,\" said Gerald, springing up the side of the\r\nopposite mountains, regardless of the rending of his light blouse, and\r\nhis scratched hands; and before long he stood on the summit.\r\n\r\n\"This will do for us capitally,\" he cried out. \"Wide plains below, but\r\nan awkward step down to them. Jack will have to cut a staircase again.\"\r\n\r\nThis account of the country satisfied Arthur, and they hastened back at\r\nonce to relieve the anxiety of their friends, whom they found in a state\r\nof great alarm. The cries of the savages had gradually approached so\r\nnear to them, that Margaret induced Wilkins and Jack to close the\r\nopening by which they had entered with a large piece of rock. Then they\r\nhad heard voices close to the rocks, and Baldabella, who was now able to\r\nspeak many English words, said--\"Many bad black fellows! much bad! see\r\nwhite man foot-walk.--Black fellow come--slow, slow--catch all--eat\r\nmaster--eat miss--eat old Jin--eat Nakinna--all! all!\"\r\n\r\nIt was with much difficulty they restrained the cries of Ruth, when she\r\ncomprehended that she was in danger of being eaten; and though Mr.\r\nMayburn doubted and disputed the existence of cannibalism in Australia,\r\nWilkins and Jack succeeded in inducing the whole family to move on in\r\nthe track of the pioneers, rather than risk the danger of discovery at\r\nthe mouth of the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Tunnel through the Mountains.--The Chase of the Emu.--An Encounter\r\nwith the Natives.--The Rescue of Baldabella and her Child.--Making a\r\nBridge.--Canoes Again.--The Fishing of Baldabella.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report of the boys decided the movement of the family, and they\r\nhastened through the long tunnel to the cheerless glen. They then sought\r\nthe easiest ascent, that they might escape from these widely-spread\r\nmountains, and a herd of kangaroos in the bush, disturbed by strange\r\nvoices, just then appeared, and bounded up the steep wood at a place\r\nwhich the travellers who followed them found had been selected with a\r\nhappy instinct, for it was less abrupt and less matted with brush than\r\nthat which Gerald had ascended. The strong assisted the weak, and with\r\nsome difficulty all were brought to the ridge, and looked down with\r\nmingled feelings of relief and alarm on the widely-spread, thinly-wooded\r\nplains so far below them.\r\n\r\nThe descent was much more tedious and laborious. Axes and ropes were put\r\nin requisition; but finally all planted their feet thankfully on the\r\ngreen sward, and looked round on a new region, where their progress\r\nwould be less retarded, but their exposure to observation would\r\nnecessarily be greater than before.\r\n\r\n\"And I see neither meat nor water,\" said Jenny, despondingly.\r\n\r\n\"We have still potatoes left,\" said Margaret; \"and though we have not\r\nyet seen much animal life, I trust there is no fear of famine. I\r\ncertainly see some creature moving beneath yon golden acacia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huzza! papa!\" cried Gerald. \"There's the Emu at last! I saw one at the\r\nZoological Gardens, and I know the fellow at once. Now, how are we to\r\nget hold of him? I fear his skin is too tough for a spear or an arrow to\r\ndo much harm, and Arthur is so careful of his charges.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have but four left,\" answered Arthur, with a sigh, \"and I am\r\nunwilling to waste my shot, and perhaps attract the attention of the\r\nwandering natives. We will try arrows and spears, and, if we can, the\r\nboomerang.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be canny, lads!\" cried Wilkins, in great excitement. \"Keep at his back,\r\nI tell ye; he can see half a mile afore him, but he's as deaf as a post;\r\nand if he once gets a sight on us he'll be off like Voltigeur, and he'll\r\nbe a smart chap as sets eyes on him again. Stand here, we'll try a throw\r\nnow; and _Jin_, woman, gie us a touch of yer boomerang.\"\r\n\r\nBaldabella was as much excited as any of the party, and perfectly\r\nunderstood the rules of emu-hunting. They fixed themselves at a proper\r\ndistance, and then, seeing that the bird, which had been feeding on some\r\nroot or herbage, had raised its head, as if about to move, they flung\r\ntheir spears and discharged their arrows with some effect, as a spear\r\nand an arrow were left in its side; Baldabella at the same time threw\r\nher boomerang, which struck it with such force that it staggered, and\r\nuttered a deep, booming cry; but, rallying again, it began to run very\r\nswiftly, till a second flight of spears and arrows brought it to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAll the party then went up to it; and O'Brien had approached, and was\r\nabout to touch it, when Wilkins seized his arm, and drew him back just\r\nin time; for the animal struck out its powerful leg, and shattered the\r\nbow which the boy held in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"He would have sarved your leg as bad,\" said Wilkins, \"if he could have\r\nhitten ye. He has a leg like a sledge hammer for a hit. We'se be forced\r\nto give him a few more spears afore it will be safe to come nigh him.\"\r\n\r\nBut a blow on the head stunned the huge creature; and it was then\r\nquickly dispatched and cut up. They contented themselves with carrying\r\noff the two hind quarters, which Wilkins assured them afforded the most\r\npalatable meat, and which would be ample provision for two days.\r\n\r\n\"There are some eggs, too,\" said Hugh, \"which we might carry off for\r\npapa; but they are so tremendously large and heavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The egg is, I believe, excellent food,\" said Arthur; \"but with food we\r\nare abundantly supplied. I think we must take two, however; one for\r\npapa, the other to form into that very useful vessel, a water-bottle or\r\nbucket.\"\r\n\r\nDelighted with the immense dark green egg, and the examination of the\r\ncurious, fur-like plumage of the emu, Mr. Mayburn no longer regretted\r\nthe forest scenery he had left, but cheerfully went forward over the\r\ngreen and flowery plain, till, after walking many miles, they encamped\r\nbeneath a gum-tree, made a fire, and broiled some emu-steaks, which all\r\npronounced would have been better than beef-steaks if they could have\r\nhad a little salt to eat with them; but they were gradually becoming\r\nreconciled to this privation.\r\n\r\nNo one dared to murmur, amidst their blessings, because they had been a\r\nday without water; but they trusted in God to provide them with this\r\nboon, too, in his good time. The large egg was carefully cleaned out\r\nthrough a small opening made by Jack at one end, and then slung with\r\ncords, to make it convenient to carry next day, before they took their\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nBut the next day they had travelled for many hours, till, faint and\r\nweary, their steps were feeble and languid, when the sight of a line of\r\ncasuarina-trees directed them to the bed of a river, now quite dry; and\r\nwhile the most exhausted sat down to rest, the young and active\r\nproceeded up the hard bed till it became mud, and a little higher, muddy\r\npools. Into these pools they, at once, plunged their faces, and drank,\r\nand moistened their burning skin, and then each laughed at the crust of\r\ndirt left on his neighbor's face. But by persevering in walking on, they\r\nmet with a pool of clearer water, from which they filled their water\r\nbuckets and mussel-shells, and returned to take the refreshment to their\r\nfriends, and then to conduct them to the moister region.\r\n\r\nThey continued to pursue the course of the chain of pools which must in\r\na short time be really a river, when the periodical rains came on. The\r\nprospect of these approaching rains rendered all the thoughtful of the\r\nparty anxious and uneasy; for the pleasant open air life to which they\r\nhad become habituated would then be intolerable.\r\n\r\nFor two days the emu-flesh was eatable, and the pools amply supplied\r\nthem with water. Then they again reached a line of low hills from which\r\nthe river had its source; and through the shrubs and brushwood that\r\ncovered them they forced or cut their way, and descended on a more\r\nfertile and pleasant plain.\r\n\r\nBut, to their great annoyance, they beheld before them several natives\r\ngathered round a fire, employed in making spears and arrows, which they\r\nwere hardening in the fire. On one side sat two women, bruising some\r\ngrain or nuts between two stones: these women wore cloaks of opossum\r\nfur; but the men were almost entirely naked, and had their bodies marked\r\nwith frightful cicatrices. Though it was plain these natives must have\r\nseen the approach of the strangers, and probably now, for the first time\r\nbeheld white men, they preserved a dignified composure, pursuing their\r\nlabors, without any apparent notice of the intruders.\r\n\r\nArthur drew up the forces abreast in a long line, saying, \"Walk on\r\nfirmly, and imitate the indifference of the natives. I entreat you,\r\nabove all, not to show the least fear.\"\r\n\r\nThey marched slowly forward till they were close to the savages, when\r\nthe little Nakinna, attracted by the sight of a child about her own age,\r\nwhich was playing near the women, broke from her mother and ran up to\r\nthe child. The tallest of the men then stepped from the rest and caught\r\nup the child in his arms. The distracted mother darted forward to rescue\r\nher, and was also seized and detained by two natives, while she called\r\nout piteously to her white friends to assist her.\r\n\r\nArthur was much vexed at this incident, which he feared would form a\r\npretext for a quarrel; but it was impossible to abandon poor Baldabella,\r\nwho seemed very repugnant to return to savage life. He therefore called\r\nWilkins to follow him, and going up to the man who held the child, made\r\nan effort to remove her gently from his arms. The man resisted and held\r\nher firmly; then Arthur, assuming a threatening expression of\r\ncountenance, uttered some words in a loud, stern tone, and at the same\r\ntime pointed to his rifle.\r\n\r\nThe savage stared at him and his weapon with a countenance half of fear,\r\nhalf of wonder. He then pointed to the complexion of the mother and the\r\nchild, and also to his own, and to Arthur's, as if he questioned the\r\nright of the white people to detain those who certainly were not of\r\ntheir race.\r\n\r\nArthur then made Baldabella comprehend that she must tell the men that\r\nif they did not release her and Nakinna, the white men would kill them\r\nall. The woman at once understood and repeated the message; and was\r\nanswered by the tall savage. She shook with terror as he spoke, and\r\nturning to Arthur said,--\r\n\r\n\"Black fellow say, Peter want Baldabella. Baldabella must go. No, no!\r\ngood white man! Bad Peter kill Baldabella! kill Nakinna!\"\r\n\r\nIt was doubly annoying to find these troublesome natives were acquainted\r\nwith the villanous bush-ranger; but it was certain Baldabella must not\r\nbe left in the power of the wretch, at any cost. While he hesitated what\r\nsteps to take, one of the women, roused by the cries of Nakinna, went up\r\nto the savage who held her, and spoke to him in soft, persuasive\r\naccents, at the same time attempting to take the child from him. The\r\nhardened wretch put down the child at his feet, and snatching up a club,\r\nstruck the woman to the earth, senseless, if not dead.\r\n\r\nNo longer able to control his indignation, Arthur, seeing a herd of\r\nkangaroos bounding along within reach of a shot, directed the attention\r\nof the man to them, and then fired his rifle, and shot a large animal\r\ndead. Astonishment and terror overcame the usual assumed calmness of\r\nthe natives, and several of them fled in confusion.\r\n\r\nArthur then, pointing to the kangaroo, and then to Baldabella, indicated\r\nhis wish for the exchange, and the two men who still held her readily\r\nresigned their captive, and ran up to take possession of the more\r\nvaluable spoil, followed by the inhuman chief; after he had, with a\r\nvindictive countenance, spurned the poor child from him with his foot.\r\nThe mother caught up her child and fled to her friends, prostrated\r\nherself before Arthur, and placed his foot on her neck; then rising, she\r\nresumed her usual dignified and graceful step, and fell into the rank\r\nwith the rest of the party, who lost no time in moving forward, after\r\nMargaret had seen that the unfortunate victim of the chief's cruelty was\r\nkindly attended to by the woman who was her companion.\r\n\r\n\"It were a burning shame,\" grumbled Wilkins, \"to let them saucy niggers\r\ntake off with that fine beast, and have to fast ourselves. For ye see,\r\nMaster Hugh, that shot's flayed away all on 'em, and it may be long\r\nenough afore we light on 'em again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have some faith, my good man,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"We have been fed like\r\nthe prophet in the wilderness, by miracle, let us not fear, God will\r\nstill provide us with food.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the present moment,\" said Arthur, \"it would be imprudent to delay\r\neven to seek provisions. Our first consideration must be to move away\r\nfrom this part as quickly as possible, for I suspect these people will\r\nkeep us in sight as long as they can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, master,\" said Wilkins, \"they'll need ye to shoot beasts for 'em!\r\nDepend on't they'll dog us.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an uncomfortable suspicion, and Margaret and Arthur talked and\r\npondered deeply on plans and arrangements, almost regardless of the\r\nbrilliant buds and blossoms that enchanted Mr. Mayburn. They walked on\r\nwith regular and rapid steps over the flower-strewed ground, amidst the\r\nrich smell of the foliage and the flowers and the strange music of the\r\nwoods. Kangaroos and emus were seen at some distance, but prudence\r\nforbade any delay for the chase, and they made no halt till extreme\r\nfatigue compelled them to rest on the side of a grassy hill, where the\r\nleast wearied set out to search the bushes for nests. Some fine young\r\nbirds supplied them with a good supper; eggs were now rarely found, but\r\nwith these Ruth's fowls frequently supplied them.\r\n\r\n\"Where next?\" asked Margaret. \"I think, Arthur, I can distinguish a\r\ndeep-green line far distant to the south-east. May we not hope it\r\nindicates the situation of another river?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have ever been cheered, thank God,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"through all\r\nour pilgrimage, with continued benefits. We have never yet experienced\r\nthe perils and privations of the desert, which has ever been supposed to\r\nexist in the interior of Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Travellers in South Australia,\" replied Arthur, \"have certainly met\r\nwith those barren regions; but in this tropical country we have, indeed,\r\nenjoyed all the plenty which nature can bestow. At present we need\r\nwater; but in the morning we will, if God permits, direct our course to\r\nthe green belt we have seen. If we can again resume our canoe voyaging,\r\nit will be a great relief to us; and even if the river be dried up at\r\npresent, we can take the bed for our guide, and may find pools of water\r\nfor our daily use. But, my dear Margaret, I am ashamed to say I feel\r\ndespondent when I reflect that this is January; the autumn rains may\r\nsoon come on, and we have no idea where we can shelter you and dear papa\r\nfrom the fury of tropical storms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could soon run up a bit of a hut, with bark roofing,\" said Jack,\r\nbriskly.\r\n\r\n\"I am quite aware of that, Jack,\" answered Arthur, \"and have much\r\nreliance on your skill and promptness. The great difficulty seems to be\r\nthe selection of a site out of the observation of the treacherous and\r\nvindictive natives; or of one whom I dread still more, that vile\r\nbush-ranger, who appears to be tracking us for some evil purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a spite again me, that's sartain, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins.\r\n\"Then, he'd like to put his hands on that gun; and there would be,\r\nlikely, some pickings of things as would suit him, let alone money,\r\nthat, like enough, ye'll have amang ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what possible use can the misguided man have for money in a\r\nwilderness among savages?\" asked Mr. Mayburn, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Why, not a deal of use just hereabouts,\" answered Wilkins; \"but ye ken\r\nnought about bush-rangers, and all their rounds and changes. If Peter\r\nhad cash, he'd be off to some of them far away bush publics; and there\r\nhe'd have a grand tuck out, till he'd spent every rap, and be fresh to\r\nset out on a new hook. That's bush-ranging life, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a fearful life it is in this world, Wilkins,\" said Mr. Mayburn;\r\n\"but still more fearful as a preparation for the world to come. Thank\r\nGod that you are rescued from it, my poor man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, I'se clear on't now,\" replied he, \"thanks to ye, master; and, God\r\nbe praised, there's no shame can stick to a fellow for turning round\r\nwhen he's got into a slough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Wilkins,\" said his good teacher; \"the best Christians have\r\nsinned and repented; and to all it is said that they must through much\r\ntribulation enter the kingdom of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe heart of Wilkins was enclosed in a rough husk, but the soil was not\r\nbad; the seed that was sown in it was not unfruitful, but was slowly\r\ncoming to maturity.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning the pilgrims took the road towards the green belt\r\nthey had observed the previous day; and though many tedious hours\r\nintervened before they reached it, they were rewarded by discovering\r\nthat the belt of trees hung over the banks of a considerable river,\r\nnarrow, but deep, with high rocky banks, so far above the level of the\r\nstream on the side on which they stood, that the water which they so\r\nmuch required was unattainable.\r\n\r\nThis disappointment was vexatious, and they continued to pass along the\r\nedge of the cliff for some time in melancholy silence, till, at a very\r\nnarrow part of the river, Jack stopped, and, pointing to a tall tree on\r\nthe edge, proposed that they should cut it down, so that it should fall\r\nacross the river and form a bridge. This would be an undertaking at once\r\ntedious and hazardous; but the advantage of placing the river between\r\nthemselves and the inimical savages was obvious, as it was improbable\r\nthat they should have the means of crossing. It was therefore agreed\r\nthat they should make the experiment.\r\n\r\nThey had found abundance of the wild oats on the plain, which were now\r\nquite ripe; and Ruth was busily employed in bruising the grain to make\r\nbiscuits, while Jenny roasted potatoes in the ashes, and looked down on\r\nthe river with longing eyes, for the tea-shrub was abundant round them,\r\nand nurse pined for her cup of tea again. Leaving the women thus\r\nengaged, the young woodcutters commenced their operations with their\r\nstone axes, though they had failed to render them very sharp, relieving\r\neach other at intervals; for in truth the cutting down a stout tree was\r\nnot a little tiresome.\r\n\r\nBut perseverance subdues great difficulties; at last the tree fell\r\nmajestically, and rested securely on the opposite bank. Then the proud\r\nyoung workmen proceeded to lop the branches which stood in the way,\r\nlevelling and smoothing the trunk as much as they were able, and running\r\nover it to prove its security; and, finally, Jack carried a rope across,\r\nattached to some of the erect boughs, to form a sort of hand-rail to\r\nsatisfy the timid. With some persuasion, Mr. Mayburn was so far\r\nsatisfied of the safety of the rude bridge, that he suffered himself to\r\nbe led across; then Margaret and the two women were safely conducted\r\nover; Baldabella followed, looking with astonishment at their timidity,\r\nand tripping lightly along with her child upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen all had crossed, the rope was withdrawn and coiled up again, and,\r\nwith the aid of levers and axes, the bridge was broken and cast down, to\r\nbe floated away by the stream, that the savages might not have the\r\nadvantage of it in their pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe banks on which the travellers now stood were less precipitous than\r\nthose they had left; they were clothed with bamboos and rushes, and in\r\nmany places open down to the river, where they gladly procured the\r\nwater of which they were so much in need. Then they continued to walk\r\nalong a narrow muddy strand, looking with longing eyes at the smooth\r\nwater, on which a canoe might have been paddled with so much less\r\nexertion than the continued labor of walking. It would soon be made,\r\nJack declared; and, after a night's rest, all were ready to work, if the\r\nwork were provided for them--the great point, as Jack said, being \"to\r\nfall on the right sort of tree.\"\r\n\r\nBefore they had finished another weary day's walk, they had \"fallen on\r\nthe right tree,\" barked it, and, uniting their efforts, formed and\r\ngummed two canoes. These required a day to be hardened for service,\r\nduring which they made paddles, cut down the oat grass to serve for\r\nlining the canoes, after they had thrashed out the ripe grain. The women\r\nbaked biscuits and boiled fish, with which the river abounded, collected\r\nsome tea-leaves, and finished provisioning the boats.\r\n\r\nNext morning they were again seated in these very commodious canoes,\r\ndelighted to rest after all their fatigues; for the labor of paddling on\r\nthe smooth river was comparatively easy. They continued an uninterrupted\r\nvoyage of many days, though they several times saw the smoke of fires\r\nrising from the brush on the north bank, and sometimes even heard the\r\n_coo-ee_ of the natives, which made them apprehensive that they were not\r\nunnoticed; but they satisfied themselves that their mode of travelling\r\ndefied pursuit. They rarely landed more than once a day, usually on the\r\nsouth bank, where they often met with some small tributary stream,\r\nabounding in fish, and the adroit spearing of Baldabella always provided\r\nthem with an abundant supply, sufficient for supper and breakfast. This\r\nfish was principally the fresh-water cod, as they named it, of very\r\nlarge size. Every morning after breakfast, before they embarked, they\r\nwalked out to look round for some favorable spot to which they might\r\nretire during the approaching rains, but in vain. Still the high cliffs\r\ncontinued on one side of the river; and on the side where they wished to\r\nremain they still saw spread before them marshy plains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nA _Cache_.--The Black Forest.--A Site for the Hut--The Eagles.--Gerald's\r\nAccident.--A Subterranean Grotto.--The Pitcher Plant.--A Potato\r\nGround.--The Fig-tree.--Australian Jumbles.--The Hungry Guest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey began at last to be weary of the monotonous voyaging, and were\r\nglad, one morning, on ascending the banks, to see a change of scenery.\r\nThe reedy swamps were replaced by rich grassy slopes, where tall trees\r\nand bright creeping blossoms, the fragrant golden flower of the _Acacia_\r\nand the balmy odor from various trees of the _Eucalyptus_ kind,\r\nencouraged them to hope that they might find a retreat in such a\r\npleasant region.\r\n\r\n\"Halloo!\" cried Wilkins. \"Just all on ye step here, and take a good look\r\nat this here tree. We're not the first white folks as has had a look\r\nround hereabout. As sure as you're there, Mr. Arthur, there's a _catch_,\r\nas they call 't, under this same tree. Look ye, I kenned it all as soon\r\nas ever I set eyes on that there criss-cross, cut wi' an honest steel\r\nblade, I'se warrant it; and says I to mysel', our own folks has been\r\nhere, and we'll just try a bit at their diggings; that's wi' yer leave,\r\nMr. Arthur.\"\r\n\r\nArthur hesitated; he certainly neither wished to commit, nor to connive\r\nat, a robbery; but he considered some information worth knowing might be\r\nfound in the _cache_. He therefore sent to the canoes for shells,\r\nspades, and knives; and all the young men began to dig with as much\r\nearnestness and anxiety as if they had been the gold-diggers in the\r\nsouth of the country.\r\n\r\n\"If we were to find a great nugget of gold,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"I would rather find a good saw,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Or an iron kettle,\" suggested Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"I should like a telescope,\" said Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"Now, nurse, what will you have?\" asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, Mr. Arthur, honey, if I must speak,\" answered nurse, \"I\r\nwould say a barrel of flour; but just as God pleases.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel it! I feel it!\" cried Gerald, flinging away his knife in his\r\necstasy. \"It is something hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be very careful,\" said Arthur. \"We must not damage the hidden stores.\r\nWhatever can it be? here are canisters and bags.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be tea and sugar,\" cried Ruth, clapping her hands with delight.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay, lass, what need for folks to bury tea and sugar?\" said\r\nWilkins. \"Here's summut a deal better--powder and shot. And see here,\r\nMr. Arthur, ye're a scholar; this'll be like her Majesty's ship's name\r\non 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is, indeed,\" replied Arthur, \"and the date when they were placed\r\nhere, which is three years ago. I fear the owners will never return to\r\nclaim them now.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better for us,\" said Wilkins. \"There's nought here a bit worse,\r\nand it's all fair, ye ken, Mr. Arthur. Finders, keepers, all t' world\r\nround.\"\r\n\r\nArthur looked inquiringly at his father.\r\n\r\n\"The wisdom of the world, Wilkins,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"is not always the\r\nwisdom of God. But, in the case of this treasure-trove, Arthur, as the\r\nammunition is certainly the property of her Majesty, lying useless\r\nhere, I do think--Margaret, am I right?--I am of opinion that we may\r\nappropriate a part of this valuable deposit; leaving in the place a\r\nwritten acknowledgment of the loan. Then, if God spares us to have the\r\nopportunity, we must report our trespass to the Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are right, dear papa,\" said Margaret; \"but the temptation\r\nis so great, that perhaps we are none of us in a state to give impartial\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins, without listening to a word of the discussion, had taken on\r\nhimself the responsibility of the offence, and was already actively\r\nengaged in moving off the bags and canisters to the boats.\r\n\r\n\"Not more than we may need, remember, Wilkins,\" said Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"And who's to say what we may need, miss,\" answered the man. \"We've\r\nmony a hundred mile to trot yet, and some uglier customers than t' black\r\nfellows to come on afore we've done, and that's them hang-gallows\r\nbush-rangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will compromise with our conscience,\" said Arthur, \"by taking away\r\nhalf the store; and papa's portable writing-case will supply us with the\r\nmeans of making a brief statement and an apology.\"\r\n\r\nThe note was written, enclosed in a bark case, and attached to one of\r\nthe bags left in the hole; the soil was then restored, and the turf\r\ncarefully replaced, so that no trace of the _cache_ might attract the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n\"They'd make a bonny kettle of fish, if they did come on 't,\" said\r\nWilkins; \"for ten to one they'd fling t' powder on t' fire, and then\r\nthere'd not be mony on 'em left to talk about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must take especial care to guard our cargo against fire,\" said\r\nArthur; \"and we have also another enemy to fear--the water--which might\r\nsoon render our treasure useless. Therefore, the sooner we leave the\r\nboats, and 'take to the bush,' as Wilkins says, the better. This country\r\ncertainly looks pleasant; but I should prefer a more woody and sheltered\r\nspot.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you look directly south, Arthur,\" said Hugh, \"you will see a black\r\nspot, which, I take it, must be a thick forest. It would make a good\r\nland-mark for us, if we leave the river. What do you say? must we aim\r\nfor it?\"\r\n\r\nArthur directed his attention to Hugh's black forest, which certainly\r\nstood in the way they wished to go; and as there was no appearance of\r\nsmoke, or even of former fires on the plains, there was some reason to\r\nthink the district might not be frequented by the savages. These\r\nconsiderations decided them to abandon once more the easy\r\ncanoe-voyaging, and, with the weighty addition to their burdens of the\r\nammunition from the _cache_, they slowly set out. The plain was covered\r\nwith rich high grass that would have fed thousands of cattle, but was\r\nnow only tenanted by herds of graceful kangaroos and small detachments\r\nof tall stalking emus. The trees were populated with swarms of parrots,\r\ncockatoos, pheasants, and small warblers, and the air rang with their\r\nmingled notes, cheerful at least, if not harmonious.\r\n\r\nWhen the dark wood became fully visible to them, Margaret observed that\r\nBaldabella seemed startled and uneasy, and frequently paused as if\r\nreluctant to proceed. But when, after an hour's walk, the sombre thick\r\nforest spread before them, half a mile across, the woman turned round to\r\nMargaret with trembling limbs, and said in a faltering voice, pointing\r\nto the forest, \"Good miss, no go; bad spirit kill all people; good\r\nmaster, Baldabella, all die. Bad spirit very angry, say no people go\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret tried to reason with the terrified woman, who had now turned\r\nround to flee with her child; she appeared to be agitated in the highest\r\ndegree, and when the child clung to Margaret, who turned to follow the\r\nrest, the distressed mother, wringing her hands, wailed in the most\r\npathetic manner; till at length, with an air of sudden resolution, she\r\ndrew herself up, with her usual dignity, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Baldabella die, not leave good friends,\" and walked calmly on by the\r\nside of Margaret.\r\n\r\nArthur had learned previously that the natives regarded a dark wood with\r\nsuperstitious awe; but he now concluded that Baldabella had some\r\nacquaintance with this particular spot, and that it was an object of\r\nfear to the natives. This was a circumstance which would render it still\r\nmore desirable to the travellers as a place of seclusion; and when they\r\ncame up close to the gloomy forest, they did not wonder at the\r\nsuperstitious dread of the ignorant savages. It seemed as if neither man\r\nnor beast, nor even the light of heaven, could penetrate the mysterious\r\nspot. Lofty trees, resembling the pine, the chestnut and the cypress, as\r\nclosely ranged as it was possible for nature to plant them, were so\r\ninterwoven and matted together, for the height of eight or ten feet with\r\ncoiled thorny shrubs and creeping plants, that they formed an\r\nimpenetrable fortress that seemed to defy the impotent attacks of man.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder which of us is the favored prince who is to 'cut his bright\r\nway through,' this enchanted wood,\" said Gerald. \"Here's an adventure,\r\nHugh! Now for knives and axes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be too hasty, boys,\" said Arthur. \"It would be prudent to make\r\nthe circuit of the wood first, in order to select the most accessible\r\npoint. Besides,\" continued he, as they walked on, \"I think we must\r\nproceed with caution. We will cut a low tunnel, the entrance to which\r\ncan be easily closed, if we find it possible to remain here for a short\r\nseason; and thus we shall leave no trace of our presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be well content to remain here,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"amidst\r\nthese noble and curious trees and shrubs. To study their varieties will\r\nsufficiently occupy and amuse me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I shall be satisfied to live in a hut,\" said Margaret, \"however\r\nrude it may be, where we can have rest and peace; where we can repair\r\nour tattered garments, and perhaps make new boots to replace these worn\r\nfragments. But I fear our abode in the forest must be gloomy and\r\ndepressing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can build a nest in the trees,\" said Gerald, \"as the people did in\r\nthe Swiss Family Robinson, and live in the cheerful society of parrots\r\nand cockatoos. That looks like the very fig-tree the family inhabited;\r\nlet us choose it. See, it is covered with ripe figs that look very\r\ntempting. I should like to climb for some.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fig-tree will not fly away, Gerald,\" said Arthur, \"and just now we\r\nmust all have more important employment. We must immediately commence\r\nour tunnel, for the air is more sultry than ever, and I have fancied\r\nmore than once that I have heard the distant roll of thunder. I\r\nsincerely wish we had a shelter at hand. I must call on you, my\r\nfriends, to halt at once. We will try this point.\"\r\n\r\nThe part of the wood before which they had arrived, though quite\r\nimpervious, was less thorny than any part they had yet passed, and\r\ntherefore more easy to work, and they began to cut down the entangled\r\nbrushwood for about four feet in height, and wide enough to admit the\r\npassage of one person only. The lopped branches were carefully\r\ncollected, to be removed to the interior of the wood, when the path was\r\ncompleted; but their labor was long and tedious, for the forest could\r\nnot be less than fifty yards in breadth. Fortunately after piercing it\r\nfor twenty yards, they found the underwood less rank and entangled, and\r\nwere satisfied with trampling it down to make the road smoother for the\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThis wood terminated finally in a glade of extraordinary beauty, richly\r\nclothed with grass and studded with the gorgeous flowers of the tropical\r\nregions. This glade spread before them level for some distance, then\r\ngradually sloped upwards, thickly grown with wild oats, and then with\r\nbrush, to a great height, the whole forming an isolated mountain, which\r\nwas apparently flat at the summit.\r\n\r\nThe young boys declared this must be the very abode of enchantment; and\r\nas the ascent was a succession of green terraces, they were all able,\r\nwith some fatigue, but with little difficulty, to attain the highest\r\nridge, when they saw, with some astonishment, that a few feet below them\r\nlay a basin or crater, covered with verdure--tall grass mingled with the\r\nusual thick brush.\r\n\r\nAfter gazing on it for a few minutes, Hugh said, \"What a capital place\r\nfor our hut. Margaret cannot call this height gloomy, for, by mounting\r\nthe ridge, we can look over the forest and survey the whole country\r\nround us. Then the flowers are so gay and pleasant, and we shall see\r\nmultitudes of birds. Do look, papa, at those two superb eagles that are\r\nsoaring above our heads, and that doubtless have their eyrie somewhere\r\nin this mountain.\"\r\n\r\nBut while they were gazing at the birds, O'Brien, who stood at some\r\ndistance from them, was making ready his bow, and before they were aware\r\nof it he had skilfully sent an arrow into one of the eagles, which fell\r\nfluttering and screaming among the brushwood.\r\n\r\n\"Victory! victory!\" he cried, looking round for Mr. Mayburn. \"Did you\r\nsee me shoot the eagle, papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw and admired the magnificent creatures, Gerald,\" answered Mr.\r\nMayburn; \"and I deeply grieved to see one fall by your hand. It was no\r\nvictory, but a wanton cruelty. You have destroyed the noble bird for no\r\nuseful purpose, and my heart is afflicted to observe the distress of the\r\nattached mate. See how he circles round the spot which has left him\r\nbereaved and lamenting. I am forcibly reminded of the powerful words of\r\none of our modern classical poets, who, in describing such a tragical\r\nbereavement, writes,--\r\n\r\n                'She whom he mourns\r\n    Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,\r\n    In some far stony gorge, out of his ken,\r\n    A heap of fluttering feathers: never more\r\n    Shall the lake glass her flying over it;\r\n    Never the black and dripping precipices\r\n    Echo her stormy scream as she sails by!'\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would have liked to possess the bird, papa,\" said Gerald,\r\n\"and I am really sorry for the widowed mate. I feel quite uncomfortable\r\nto see the old fellow soaring round me and uttering, I have no doubt,\r\nviolent abuse. But I may as well recover my game, that you may gratify\r\nyour curiosity by examining an Australian eagle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw it fall just behind yon yellow-flowered shrub, which looks so\r\nlike our own English furze,\" said Hugh.\r\n\r\nGerald dashed forward into the bush to search for his prize, while\r\nMargaret and her father examined with great satisfaction the rich\r\ntable-land, and Jack pointed out a favorable site for a wattled,\r\nbark-roofed hut, which, he asserted, might be easily constructed in a\r\ncouple of days. But while they were discussing this important affair,\r\nthey were alarmed by a loud cry from Gerald, \"Help, help! the enchanter\r\nhas got me! Come, Arthur, by yourself, and throw me a rope!\"\r\n\r\nAll were in alarm, and where to throw the rope was the question, for the\r\nboy was not to be seen. Arthur and Jack, with a pole and ropes, stepped\r\nlightly over the bushes, expecting to find Gerald plunged in a marsh.\r\nHis cries directed them to a spot, where they saw only his head and one\r\narm clinging to a bush.\r\n\r\n\"Take care what you are about,\" said he; \"I have slipped into a hole,\r\nand perhaps there may be more like it. You had better just slide the\r\npole along till I can catch it, and then, perhaps, I may manage to raise\r\nmyself. The worst is, I hear that furious eagle, fluttering and hissing\r\njust below me, and I am every moment in fear lest she should attack me,\r\nand peck my legs to revenge her wrongs.\"\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the rope and the pole, and the exertions of his friends,\r\nGerald scrambled to a safe spot in the bushes, and then they all took a\r\nsurvey of the cave, or grotto, that lay below; and were so much\r\ninterested by it, that they resolved to explore it at once. Jack\r\nvolunteered to make the first expedition, and began by attaching the\r\nrope to a stout bush to facilitate his descent, and taking with him the\r\npole to test the security of the ground below.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the cave was not more than twelve feet below the opening,\r\nand Jack looked round to find himself in a large grotto, floored with\r\ndry white sand; the rocky sides were garlanded with creeping plants, and\r\nit was lighted by many apertures above, similar to that through which\r\nGerald had fallen, and, like that, almost covered with brushwood. Dark\r\nbranch-caves ran from this airy grotto, into which they penetrated for a\r\nfew yards, to satisfy themselves that it was uninhabited; and, from the\r\nobservations he made, Arthur could not but believe the whole was of\r\nvolcanic origin, and, in fact, a portion of the crater of an exhausted\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\n\"We may find a capital magazine here for the powder,\" said Jack; \"and\r\nthis light part will make a kitchen for the women folks while we are\r\nbuilding the hut Think you, Mr. Arthur, I should make them a ladder?\r\nThey'll hardly like swinging down by a rope.\"\r\n\r\nArthur thought they would certainly not like such a mode of descent, and\r\nthe ladder was decided on. Then he ventured to draw near the screaming\r\neagle to endeavor to extract the arrow from his wing, but the bird made\r\nsuch fierce returns for his kindness, that he was compelled to retreat,\r\nand wait for a more favorable moment for the operation; and in the mean\r\ntime, the youths ascended to report the discovery of the cave.\r\n\r\nWilkins had been employed in cutting down and bringing up the ascent a\r\nquantity of the wild oats, and Margaret and her father were found\r\nstanding by a pool of clear water, which, though now somewhat shallow,\r\nwould doubtless contain an abundant supply after the rain. Around this\r\npond Mr. Mayburn had found many new and beautiful flowers, and, as soon\r\nas he was satisfied of O'Brien's safety, he hastened to point out one of\r\nhis most valued acquisitions.\r\n\r\n\"Observe, my dear children,\" said he, \"one of the most curious plants\r\never discovered, _Cephalotus follicularis_, one of the pitcher-plants,\r\nso named from the peculiar-form of the delicate white blossoms. You\r\nperceive that these _pitchers_ on the strong footstalk contain water--in\r\nthis are some drowned insects. Hence, some writers have asserted that\r\nthese flowers are used by the larger insects of prey as receptacles for\r\ntheir food. But we must see that this accumulated moisture is to\r\npreserve the plant in its beauty during the long dry season.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we not plant potatoes here?\" asked Margaret. \"In this genial\r\nclimate we might soon raise a crop, and our stock is now very low.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we can, Meggie,\" said Hugh. \"I understand the habits of our\r\n_solanum_. This light, dry, fresh soil will exactly suit it. Come,\r\nGerald, let us lose no time in marking off and clearing our\r\npotato-ground, before the rains stop us. That will be more useful than\r\nshooting eagles.\"\r\n\r\nThey were all gratified with the discovery of the cave, and anxious to\r\nsee it, but were induced to wait till a ladder was made, which was to be\r\ncommenced as soon as a party had returned to the wood to fill up the\r\nmouth of the tunnel. For this purpose they used part of the lopped\r\nbranches, which they arranged so artfully, that no one could suspect a\r\nbreach had been made. The remainder of the brushwood was to be conveyed\r\nup the mountain for firewood.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Hugh and Gerald made a foray in an immense fig-tree,\r\ndispersing the feathered tenants, and carrying off a large stock of the\r\nripe fruit. The rest returned, laden with firewood and wild oats. Then\r\nJenny made them some tea, and cakes of bruised oats, mixed with the\r\nplentiful but insipid juice of the figs. These cakes were baked in the\r\nashes, and much enjoyed by the ever keenly hungry boys, who named the\r\ndark hard biscuits Australian jumbles.\r\n\r\nBefore night should put an end to their labors, Jack and the young boys\r\ncut down a slender tree, resembling the pine, to make a ladder; and\r\nMargaret, with the help of Wilkins, pared off the turf, dug a large plot\r\nof ground, and planted it with potatoes. Then, worn out with a day of\r\nextreme toil, the wayfarers rested beneath a threatening sky, in the\r\nheated atmosphere which indicated an approaching storm.\r\n\r\nA few drops of rain at daybreak roused up the whole family to prompt\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\"It's no time to start and build to-day,\" said Wilkins. \"Wait a bit;\r\nhere's a storm ower our heads; or, if ye want work, what say ye to\r\nsinking yon bit pond a foot deeper? it holds nought, and when t' rain\r\nfalls it'll overflow and half drown us, if we don't mind.\"\r\n\r\nArthur thought it was a more prudent plan to dig another pond or\r\nreservoir, rather deeper than the original one, and make a channel\r\nbetween the two. They should thus secure a supply of water, and prevent\r\ntheir potato ground from being washed away by a sudden flood.\r\n\r\n\"And, now that the ladder is finished,\" said Margaret, \"it would be\r\nbetter that papa and I should descend at once into this subterranean\r\ngrotto, and make it ready for our temporary abode, till you are able to\r\nbuild a hut; for there is certainly a prospect of rain falling to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along,\" cried Gerald, \"that I may usher you into my\r\nnewly-discovered dominions. Now, Ruth, we shall have you safe; you will\r\nhave few opportunities of committing mischief when you are below the\r\nearth. Come and descend into the burning mountain, and take care you\r\ndon't fight with my eagle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! master, is't true--is't a burning mountain?\" asked Ruth, in terror.\r\n\r\n\"It has been a volcano,\" answered Mr. Mayburn, \"but, in all probability,\r\nexhausted, hundreds of years ago. It is now, as you see, a beautiful\r\nwilderness.\"\r\n\r\nRuth did not regard the beauty of the spot; she saw only, in her mind's\r\neye, the red flames pouring from Mount Vesuvius, as depicted in a gaudy\r\npicture-book she had seen in her childhood.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, Miss Marget,\" she exclaimed, \"stay up here! don't go down\r\ninto that hole; it'll, maybe, break out again, and we'll all be burnt\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nBut Margaret remonstrated, the boys laughed and Jenny scolded; and,\r\nfinally, Jack brought Ruth down to the range of subterranean apartments,\r\nwhere Margaret and Jenny soon planned dormitories, kitchen, and\r\nstore-rooms. A large alcove was to be the chapel, and the light bowery\r\ngrotto beneath the entrance was to be the drawing-room,--at least, till\r\nthe heavy rains should compel them to seek more effectual shelter. Here\r\nthey collected stones for seats, and rolled into the midst a large piece\r\nof rock for a table, upon which was spread the breakfast of tea and\r\noat-cakes, at present their only provision.\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn was delighted to have the opportunity of inspecting so\r\nnearly the wounded, but still fierce eagle, with its shining black\r\nplumage; and he judged it was that known as _Aquila Fucoso_. It was in\r\nvain, however, to attempt a close examination till Wilkins and Jack,\r\nafter some struggling, and a few severe pecks, succeeded in holding it\r\ntill Arthur extracted the arrow from the wing, and saw that nature would\r\nprobably heal the wound in a few days. In the mean time the bird was\r\nstarving, for it rejected with disdain the farinaceous food offered to\r\nit; and Hugh and Gerald promised, as soon as the reservoir was\r\ncompleted, to set out and shoot some small birds or opossums, for their\r\nhungry guest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nThe Reservoir.--The Rains.--The Native Companion.--The Employments of\r\nPrison Life.--The Unlucky Chase.--Jack's Tale of Trouble.--Black Peter's\r\nTemptations.--The Release of the Eagle.--The Rescue Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reservoir was six feet deep and ten feet in diameter, and was lined\r\nwith flat stones from the interior of the cave, where large slabs were\r\nscattered round. This was not completed in one day, and on the second\r\nmorning, while Wilkins and Jack finished the work, and, after digging a\r\ntrench, laid down a spout of bark between the ponds, Hugh and Gerald\r\nwent down to the wood below, to shoot birds. But before the end of the\r\nday the workmen were driven to shelter by the violent rain; and the two\r\nboys returned, drenched to the skin, and laden with pheasants,\r\ncockatoos, and a wild turkey, as large as an English Christmas turkey,\r\nand resembling that bird so much, that the name was considered not\r\ninappropriate. They had, thus, a handsome dinner for themselves, and\r\nabundance of food for the hungry and somewhat tamed eagle.\r\n\r\nThey were seated at their late repast when the storm began in earnest;\r\ntremendous peals of thunder rolled through the immense hollows of the\r\nmountain, and seemed to shake the very rocks from their foundation. Ruth\r\nscreamed and looked round in distraction, expecting the eruption of the\r\nvolcano was at hand; and even the proud eagle trembled to hear the voice\r\nof the skies. Then the rain came down in torrents, showering through\r\nthe leafy coverings of numerous apertures above them, and driving them\r\nback into the gloomy security of the solid rocks; grateful for even that\r\ndismal retreat in the sudden storm.\r\n\r\n\"We need not remain in the dark, though we are in the crypt,\" said Hugh.\r\n\"Come, Gerald, let us light some flambeaux, and fix them on the walls;\r\nthen, with all these trailing garlands suspended from above, we may\r\nfancy ourselves in a ball-room.\"\r\n\r\nThe caverns were lighted up, and then every one found employment. Mr.\r\nMayburn produced the head and neck of the turkey, which he contemplated\r\nwith much interest.\r\n\r\n\"It certainly must be the bird described as the _Wattled Talegalla_,\r\nArthur,\" said he, \"and which is considered to represent the turkey in\r\nAustralia; the red skin of the head, bright orange wattle, and large\r\ndisproportionate feet, prove the fact; and I am gratified that you have\r\nobtained a specimen of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all gratified, papa,\" said Margaret, \"for it is the most useful\r\nand delicious bird we have yet found in this ornithological paradise.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys employed themselves in thrashing the wild oats, storing the\r\ngrain in bags, and then arranging the straw for mattrasses--a perfect\r\nluxury to them, after they had for so long slept on the bare ground.\r\nThey had their knives and axes, and abundant material in the boughs and\r\nspare pieces of the tree that was cut down for the ladder; and, to fill\r\nup the time, Jack presided over a school of art, where the ingenious and\r\nactive employed heads and hands, and produced some articles of great\r\nuse. Margaret took the opportunity to teach lessons of civilization and\r\nreligion to the lively little Nakinna, and, through the child, poured\r\nthe words of truth into the heart of the mother. Wilkins, who was\r\nmiserable when unemployed, good-naturedly assisted Jenny and Ruth in\r\nvarious household matters, made a stone hearth for the fire, helped to\r\ncook, piled up the dry fuel, contrived a wattled niche for the fowls,\r\nand went out through the rain to bring in water, when needed.\r\n\r\nThree or four days were thus passed in contented seclusion, the storm\r\nstill continuing unabated; then, though the rain fell incessantly, the\r\nprisoners began to be weary, and to have a great desire to visit the\r\nworld above. They engaged to bring in fresh provisions, if Jenny would\r\nprovide dry clothes for them on their return from their foraging\r\nexpedition; and with bows, arrows, axes, and game-bags, Wilkins, Jack,\r\nand the three boys set out, delighted to return to the light, and to the\r\npure air of heaven, and enjoying even the cool rain.\r\n\r\n\"Do, Arthur, look at those tall birds with the crimson crest and huge\r\nwooden-looking beak,\" said Hugh. \"One of them would be as useful as the\r\nturkey was, for a dinner dish. I suppose we must call them storks;\r\nthough they are really, to us, among the anonymous creatures of this\r\nstrange new world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye may find t' like of them all over,\" said Wilkins. \"Folks down at t'\r\ncolony calls 'em 'native companions;' they trust ye, poor rogues, as if\r\nye were their brother; ye might just walk up to yon fellows, and wring\r\ntheir necks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which I should certainly object to do, Wilkins,\" answered Hugh. \"I\r\ncould not make up my mind to wring the neck, or to feed on, 'mine own\r\nfamiliar friend.' We will be content to reduce the multitude of the\r\nnoisy impertinent cockatoos and parrots; or suppose, Arthur, we descend\r\nto the glade below, where we can cut more wood, and shoot some opossums\r\nfor our aquiline guest. The skins will make us splendid cloaks to wear\r\nthis rainy season.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, careless of the wet plunge, the joyous youths descended through the\r\nbrushwood, and reaching the verdant glade, they shot as many opossums as\r\nthey wished; filled some bags with ripe figs, and finally, after a long\r\nchase, and many a fall on the moist slippery ground, they secured a\r\nwandering kangaroo of large size, which, in distress of weather, had by\r\nsome means found its way into this enclosed retreat.\r\n\r\nJack had in the mean time barked a tree of the _Eucalyptus_ species, and\r\ntying the cumbrous spoil with a rope, he drew it after him up the\r\nmountain. Wilkins shouldered the kangaroo, and the rest, equally laden,\r\ntoiled through the bushy, moist, sloping wood, and arrived safely at the\r\ncave, to diffuse amusement and contentment among their expecting\r\nfriends, and to furnish more employment for their enforced leisure time.\r\nThey were all invested in dry garments; then Jack examined his prize,\r\nand said,--\r\n\r\n\"Just look at this bark, Mr. Arthur. I have seen none yet so firm and\r\nhard; it is completely an inch plank, fit for any sort of work. I could\r\nmake a light wagon of it, if we had any animals to draw it; and, anyhow,\r\nI'll set about a table and some seats, directly, and then I'll try some\r\nbuckets, and dishes, and such-like things. Now's the time for work, when\r\nthere's no walking.\"\r\n\r\nFor many days the ample supply of provisions, and the amusement of\r\noccupation, reconciled the young men to the gloomy seclusion of their\r\nretreat. During this time a square piece of bark, flattened and smoothed\r\nwith sharp stones, was placed on four posts, for a table; long slips\r\nsimilarly supported, formed stools and benches. Trenchers, dishes,\r\nbuckets, and bowls, certainly somewhat rude in form, were next finished,\r\nthe gum which exuded from many trees near them supplying them\r\nplentifully with an admirable cement. There is a charm to civilized\r\nminds in being surrounded with the appliances and arrangements of\r\ndomestic life; and the women became reconciled, and even attached to\r\ntheir monotonous existence--especially when an occasional cessation of\r\nrain permitted them to live in the front portion of the cave, which was\r\nrendered pleasant and cheerful by the subdued light through the foliage.\r\n\r\nA day of fair weather tempted the young men to leave their confinement,\r\nand not only to descend to the enclosed glade below, but to venture to\r\nbreak through the charmed circle of the wood, and have a scamper over\r\nthe plains after the kangaroos and emus which frequented it. And on the\r\nmargin of a chain of pools, newly filled by the recent rains, they once\r\nmore saw the tall native companion, amid swarms of wild ducks; while,\r\nfrom among the wild oats whirred flocks of small beautiful birds\r\nresembling the quail, but with an elegant crest.\r\n\r\nThey filled their game-bags with birds, and a troop of kangaroos\r\nappearing in sight, they were tempted to pursue them for a considerable\r\ntime. At last the animals sought refuge in a spreading thick wood, into\r\nwhich Wilkins and Jack, with axes and spears, followed them. The young\r\nboys in the mean time were engaged in chasing a pair of emus; till,\r\nweary and unsuccessful, they turned away in disappointment, to join the\r\nkangaroo hunters. But just at that moment they were struck with the\r\nvexatious sound of the _coo-ee_ of the natives, which proceeded from the\r\nwood where the kangaroos had sheltered. This alarming cry decided\r\nthem--especially as Arthur was without his rifle--to return without\r\ndelay, that they might close the tunnel entrance of their abode.\r\n\r\nKeeping as much as possible under the shelter of the trees, they quickly\r\nmade their way over the plains to the Black Forest, Gerald frequently\r\nlooking back; at last he said, \"Jack and Wilkins are not yet in sight,\r\nshall I turn back to seek them, Arthur, or must I give them a halloo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither, my dear fellow,\" answered Arthur. \"However unkind it may seem,\r\nwe must not risk the discovery of our retreat by attracting the natives\r\nto our heels. Wilkins and Jack must have heard the _coo-ee_ as well as\r\nwe; and have most likely hid themselves till the savages have passed and\r\nthey can return to us safely. We must keep open, but guard, the entrance\r\ntill we see them return. Now, go on, boys; take the game-bags to the\r\ncave, and then quietly bring away my rifle and cartridge-case, without\r\nsaying a word about this vexatious incident. Till you return I will\r\nconceal myself behind the bushes, and watch for the return of our two\r\nabsentees.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys hastened to the cave, to fulfil their mission; and leaving\r\ntheir bags, which contained some of the pretty quails, to divert the\r\nattention of Mr. Mayburn and Margaret, they returned to watch silently\r\nand anxiously, ready to close the entrance as soon as their friends\r\nreturned, or if they should be alarmed by the approach of the natives.\r\nGerald climbed a tree, that he might command the plains more\r\neffectually, and, from this elevated situation, he startled Arthur by\r\ncrying out,--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Arthur! he is killed! I know he is killed! Dear old fellow, we\r\nshall never see him more! There is only Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is killed? What do you see? Do speak plainly, Gerald,\" said Arthur,\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n\"I see him coming by himself,\" answered the distracted boy. \"I mean I\r\nsee Jack; not Wilkins. It's quite sure they must have killed him; Jack\r\nnever would have left him, if he was living.\"\r\n\r\nThe two boys below were now almost as much agitated as Gerald, for they\r\nplainly saw Jack hurrying across the plain alone, and when he drew near,\r\nArthur was quite sure, from his pale and sorrowful countenance, that\r\nsome heavy misfortune had occurred. He plunged into the open tunnel, and\r\nthen said, \"Close it directly if you please, Mr. Arthur; I am so bad, I\r\ncan do nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Wilkins! where is Wilkins, Jack?\" asked Hugh.\r\n\r\nJack burst into tears as he said, \"Oh, Master Hugh! the bad rogues have\r\ngot him; and all I could think on, I couldn't help him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any hopes? Do you think they will murder him?\" asked Arthur,\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\n\"I think not, Mr. Arthur,\" answered Jack; \"but I'll tell you all about\r\nit as soon as we've closed up this gap, and tried to keep them safe that\r\nare left.\"\r\n\r\nThe distressed boys hastened to restore the barrier with particular\r\ncare; and then, as they slowly proceeded homeward, Jack related his\r\nmelancholy adventure.\r\n\r\n\"We had got quite into the thick of the wood after that unlucky capering\r\nbeast, when all at once that queer call of the black fellows rung into\r\nour ears. 'We're in for it now, and no mistake, my lad,' said Wilkins to\r\nme. 'Just you thrust yourself into that cover, and I'll listen a bit, to\r\nmake out their whereabouts.' I forced myself into a thicket, matted\r\ntogether, for about six feet upwards, as thick as this wood round us.\r\nYou had to fight for every inch of way; and I kept thinking all along\r\nthat he was following me, but he was not. You know, Mr. Arthur, he is a\r\ngood bit stouter than I am, and my fancy is that he had fought and\r\nrustled among the bushes till he'd been found out; for first I heard a\r\ndog growl, and then I heard his voice, speaking such words as he has\r\nnever said of late--an oath, Mr. Arthur; then followed such yells! and I\r\nknew they had got him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my first thought was to make my way out, that I might help him;\r\nbut just then I got a sight of all the gang of them through the bushes.\r\nThere could not be less than a hundred; and, worst of all, though he was\r\nnaked, and painted like a savage, I made out at once that bad fellow,\r\nBlack Peter, among them. Four men had hold of Wilkins. They had taken\r\naway his knife and spears, and Peter was taunting him, as they pulled\r\nhim along. I heard him say, 'Thou wast a fool, Wilkins, to stop so long\r\nwith them preaching folks; I thought thou'd a bit more spirit--thou,\r\nthat aimed to take a spell at bush-ranging, like a man. But thou'll\r\ncome along with us now, and thou'lt find we're a bit jollier than yon\r\nsmooth, long-faced dogs.'\r\n\r\n\"Then Wilkins spoke out and said, 'I reckon my comrades were somewhat\r\nbetter than thine, Peter. Anyhow, we managed to keep clothes to our\r\nbacks.'\r\n\r\n\"The sly rogue tried to get round poor Wilkins then, and went on,\r\n'That's just to please those black rogues, Wilkins; but, man, we're off\r\ndown south just now, to pick up stock, and cash too. Then we'll get good\r\nclothes; and as soon as we've done with them, we'll rid ourselves of\r\nthese black fools, and have a grand jollification out of our money.\r\nThere'll be some fun in that, man. And have these comrades of thine any\r\ncash or stuff worth lifting? I'd like that other gun they carried, and,\r\nanyhow, some powder and shot. I hav'n't a grain left--all blazed away\r\nafter such game as that,'--and the good-for-nothing fellow pointed to\r\nthe poor black natives, that didn't understand a word he had been\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\"Wilkins muttered some words, very low, that I couldn't catch; but I\r\nfancy he didn't tell truth, for Peter went on to say and swear that he\r\nwould soon be on our track, for we couldn't get far in these rains; and\r\nthat Wilkins needn't think to join us, for he would take care and keep\r\nhim in a safe place--a snuggery, he called it.\r\n\r\n\"I made up my mind that I would see what and where this snuggery was;\r\nand when the men had passed on, and were out of hearing, I cautiously\r\ntracked them to a place in the midst of the wood, which they had cleared\r\nby burning down the trees, for there lay the blackened stumps; and a\r\ncrying sin it was, Mr. Arthur, to waste so much good timber. On one\r\nside there was a great rock, into which they dragged poor Wilkins,\r\nthrough a small opening, and I saw no more of him; but I think they\r\nmeant to do him no harm, for there's little doubt Peter wants him to be\r\nuseful to him. Wilkins is a shrewd fellow, moreover; and I feel sure\r\nhe'll try to get away from them. But if they have him, as it were, in\r\nprison, what do you say, Mr. Arthur, shouldn't we help him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I think we are bound to do so,\" said Arthur. \"But we must\r\nhold a council, for we shall have to act with consideration and caution\r\nif we venture to leave our fortress.\"\r\n\r\nThere was great distress in the family, and many tears were shed when\r\nthe adventure was communicated to them; for, notwithstanding the former\r\nerrors of Wilkins, and his yet unsubdued passions, he was much beloved\r\nfor his kind nature and his attachment to his true friends. Mr. Mayburn\r\nhimself even gave his sanction to an expedition for the purpose of\r\nattempting the rescue of Wilkins, if he did not return to them in a day\r\nor two.\r\n\r\nBut for many days after this the rain fell so incessantly that it was\r\nimpossible to leave their shelter, even though all their provisions were\r\nexhausted except the valuable grain, and a scanty supply of eggs from\r\nthe domestic fowls. To these they were able occasionally to add the\r\nfruit of a large tree which grew in the glade below, bearing huge pods;\r\neach pod contained several almond-shaped seeds, which were enclosed in\r\nshells. These nuts were now ripe; they tasted like filberts, and were a\r\nvery agreeable and nutritious addition to their spare diet.\r\n\r\nThe wounded eagle, now quite sound, was an object of great interest to\r\nthe prisoners: its nature was so fierce, that Arthur despaired of its\r\never becoming tamed; but it submitted to their approach when their\r\nobject was to bring it food--usually the entrails of the birds, which\r\nhad been reserved for it. But seeing the untamable nature of the bird,\r\nand Margaret, especially, having great compassion on its mate, it was\r\nagreed to restore it to liberty; though O'Brien declared the royal bird\r\nwould doubtless, before this, have chosen another queen. One morning\r\nthere was an intermission of rain; and the opportunity was taken to\r\nrelease the captive from the bonds which secured its legs. The leafy\r\ncovering was at the same time removed from the opening above, and the\r\nglorious light allowed to stream into the cave. The sight of the sky and\r\nthe sensation of freedom roused the energy of the bird, and, with a\r\njoyous fluttering of the wings, it raised itself from the ground, soared\r\nround the confined spot for a minute, then, bursting through the\r\nopening, rose proudly to a height above, and after some gyrations, as if\r\nto test its recovered powers, it sailed away beyond the sight of its\r\nhospitable protectors, of whom two--Jenny and Ruth--rejoiced greatly at\r\nthe departure of a guest so voracious.\r\n\r\n\"My bonnie hens had to be pinched for that great ugly creature,\" said\r\nRuth, \"when now two are laying every day, and one has been sitting this\r\nfortnight; and she's sure to be lucky, Miss Marget, for I set her on\r\nthirteen eggs; two of 'em, to be sure, were not her own; Master Hugh\r\nfetched 'em in to make up a lucky cletch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Hugh, \"I should think it was perhaps the first time that an\r\nEnglish hen has had the honor of hatching the eggs of the _Cuculus\r\nPhasianus_.\"\r\n\r\nIn due time Ruth's chickens were hatched, to the great amusement of the\r\ninmates of the cave; they were carefully tended and out of reach of\r\ndanger, and seemed likely to be reared prosperously, the English family\r\nfraternizing with the Australian intruders most agreeably. A second day\r\nof fair weather determined the anxious young men to set out in search of\r\npoor Wilkins, lest the savages should have left their fastnesses in the\r\nrock, to follow their leader in his bush-ranging excursions. Day after\r\nday they had mounted high trees to scan the plain, in hopes of seeing\r\ntheir lost companion, or observing the departure of his captors; but no\r\nhuman form was seen, and Arthur felt assured that if Wilkins had\r\neffected his escape, nothing would have prevented him from making his\r\nway through the Black Forest to join them.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to take the rifle, with sufficient ammunition to\r\ndisperse the savages, and also all the weapons they possessed for, in\r\nall probability, it would be necessary to storm the fortress. Jack and\r\nthe three boys were intended to be the whole force; but Baldabella so\r\nearnestly entreated that she might accompany them that they were induced\r\nto admit her into the train. She could throw a boomerang or spear better\r\nthan any of them; her sympathy was excited for Wilkins, who had always\r\nbeen her protector; and her knowledge of the habits and the language of\r\nthe people might make her very useful to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nThe Approach to the Prison.--Baldabella's Stratagem.--The Release of the\r\nCaptive.--Wilkins's Tale of Trials.--A Well.--The Potato Crop.--The\r\nFlying Opossum.--The Salt Plant.--Preparations for a Siege.\r\n\r\n\r\nCautiously and quietly the party wound, under the cover of the trees and\r\nbushes, across the plain, till they reached the wood that enclosed the\r\nabode of the savages. Then the peril increased. Jack led the way, and\r\none after another they followed, step by step, through, under, or over\r\nthe matted brush; and, finally, the leader placed his party in a\r\nposition where they could all command a view of the rocky cave, though\r\nthey stood at a short distance from each other. On the cleared ground\r\nbefore the cave two women were seated, bruising nuts between two stones;\r\nand several children were playing round them. The anxious young men\r\nwatched for some minutes, but none of the men appeared; then Baldabella\r\nproposed to go forward to introduce herself to the women, her friends\r\npromising to rescue her if they attempted to detain her.\r\n\r\nDisencumbering herself from the light robe she condescended to wear in\r\ncivilized life, and retaining only her cloak of furs, she took her\r\nfish-spear in her hand, and penetrated to a distant part of the wood,\r\nfrom whence she made her appearance on the charred glade, many yards\r\nfrom the ambush of her friends, and with slow steps, counterfeiting\r\ngreat fatigue, she walked up to the women, to demand, as she had\r\narranged with her friends, food and repose. As soon as they perceived\r\nher, the women rose and looked round anxiously, and the young men\r\nexpected every moment to hear the signal call for them; but the solitary\r\nfeeble form of Baldabella seemed to re-assure them. She drew near and\r\ntalked for some minutes to her dark sisters; and the soft and pathetic\r\ninflections of her voice convinced the concealed party that she was\r\nappealing to that compassionate feeling which is ever so strong in the\r\nheart of woman.\r\n\r\nThe women listened, and invited the stranger to sit down by them; they\r\nfed her with the rich kernels of the nuts, and, the rain beginning to\r\nfall again, they took her with them into the cave for shelter. How\r\nanxiously the young men waited, at one moment prompted to burst out and\r\nfree the captive, who seemed to have no gaoler but the women, and then\r\nresolving to leave the whole affair to the shrewd management of\r\nBaldabella. Arthur was anxiously examining the state of his rifle and\r\nammunition, which he had carefully shielded beneath his fur cloak, when\r\nthey were roused to force their way through the bush by the loud and\r\ntriumphant voice of Wilkins, the low and apparently smothered _coo-ee_\r\nof the women, and, finally, by the appearance of Baldabella, rushing\r\nwildly from the cave, followed by Wilkins, excited, tattered, and\r\nemaciated. He carried a gun in his hand, and staggered up to his friends\r\nas if intoxicated.\r\n\r\n\"Take this, and load it directly,\" said he, giving Hugh the gun. \"My\r\nhands are so cramped wi' them tough bands, that it'll be long afore I\r\nhave any use on 'em. Rascals! rogues! Come on, I say; march while we\r\ncan; yon screeching jins will soon bring a wasp's-nest round us.\"\r\n\r\nNot caring for caution now, they hacked and burst through the thick\r\nwood, till they reached the plain; and then the _coo-ee_ of the duped\r\nwomen rang alarmingly on their ears, and was soon answered by a faint\r\nand distant cry from the absent men. Poor Wilkins, whose legs had been\r\nbound till they were numbed, made but slow progress; and Arthur ordered\r\nO'Brien and Jack, with Baldabella, to move rapidly forward, to guard,\r\nor, if necessary, to close the pass, while Hugh and he protected the\r\nslow retreat of Wilkins.\r\n\r\nThey made no use of their arms till they saw the whole body of the\r\nsavages appear outside the wood, and spears were falling round them.\r\nThen Hugh and Arthur fired their guns simultaneously into the midst of\r\nthe foes, who plunged screaming into the woods. Two men lingered\r\noutside, but another volley from the second barrel, struck down one, and\r\nhis companion disappeared in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Arthur,\" cried Wilkins, as he hurried forward, \"now don't ye\r\ntrust 'em. They're watching us; we'se be done if we make straight to our\r\ncutting. They're sharp-eyed chaps; we'se have to bubble 'em a bit.\"\r\n\r\nWilkins was right; and though it occupied some time, they made the\r\ncircuit of the forest, before they ventured to enter; after which, they\r\nlost no time in closing up the opening with great art and care. Then the\r\nrescued prisoner was conducted to the cave, welcomed with great joy,\r\nfresh clad, and fed with pheasant, biscuit, and the unfailing tea; and\r\nhis friends gathered round him to hear the tale of his hardships and\r\ntrials.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay! this is all as it ought to be,\" said he; \"and God be thanked\r\nI'se out on t'clutches of them unnat'ral dogs. They tied me hand and\r\nfoot, all 'cause I couldn't be made to swear as how I'd turn\r\nbush-ranger, and start by robbing and murdering them as had cared for me\r\nand given me meat and claithes and good advice. That brute Peter bullied\r\nme, and kicked me when he knew I was tied fast; and he'd have put a\r\nknife into me, but likely he thought to bring me into his ways; and he\r\nwere feared his blackeys might turn round on him, for they'd no ill\r\nblood again me. Then he ordered as how I were to have nought given me to\r\neat, and sure enough I'd been starved afore this; but them poor jins,\r\n'whiles, popped a few bites into my mouth, and brought me a sup of\r\nwater, when I were like to go mad for want on't. A hempen rope wouldn't\r\nhave held me, afore I lost my strength; but them stringy bark cords are\r\nlike iron.\r\n\r\n\"It were dowly wark, and mony and mony a time, master, I thought over\r\nyour words, and all my bad life, and my coward's death, and God's\r\njudgment to come. And then and there I settled it in my mind, if He\r\npleased to set me free again, I'd niver swear another oath, I'd niver\r\ntell another lie, and I'd niver miss praying for strength, when bad\r\nthoughts came into my mind. I see, Miss, ye'r crying over my black sins,\r\nand well ye may, God help me. After this, I felt a bit more cheery, and\r\nI were sure some on ye would see after me; but I niver reckoned on her\r\nto be t'first, and were quite stunned when I saw her come in with\r\nt'other jins. But I plucked up my heart; I kenned she'd mind my words,\r\nand I just said,--\r\n\r\n\"'Yer knife--cut these ropes!' and as sharp as a needle she was up to\r\nme, pulled out a knife from under her cloak, and cut me loose. But poor\r\ncreaters as we are, I couldn't move arm or leg for a good bit, and her\r\nthere, hauding a hand on one woman's mouth, and a hand on t' others,\r\nflayed as how they'd shrike out, till I come round a bit, and got my\r\narms worked round from behind me, and my feet to shuffle on. Then I\r\nthanked God in my heart, and off we came, and here we are; God bless ye\r\nall. I'se niver leave ye, whiles I have life. But, Mr. Arthur, we're not\r\nsafe; Peter's a cunning fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's one comfort, Wilkins,\" said Arthur; \"they do not like to face\r\nthe heavy rain, which is now very welcome; and before it ceases, we must\r\nmake ready for a siege; unfortunately, we want provisions.\"\r\n\r\nRuth placed herself uneasily before her poultry hutch, and Wilkins said,\r\n\"There's lots of pigeons amang yon trees; I can soon trap a lot, and\r\nfetch 'em down here alive, and we'll fit up a dove-cote, and have tame\r\nbirds to eat. We'se be forced to care nought for a drop of rain, but set\r\noff and forage about inside of t' wood.\"\r\n\r\nTo be besieged in a subterranean cave, from whence there was no retreat,\r\nwas truly an alarming prospect; and several plans of fortification and\r\ndefence were projected during the continuance of the heavy rain; while,\r\nregardless of the weather, the active youths left the cave to forage for\r\nstores, and to survey the plains that divided them from their enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Do look at our potatoes, Arthur,\" said Hugh; \"how they have sprung up\r\nthe last month. In another week they will be fit to eat, and we shall\r\nhave a plentiful crop of these useful roots.\"\r\n\r\nThough they saw all was still on the moist plain, they did not venture\r\nbeyond the wood, but easily procured birds, figs, and oats in abundance;\r\nand after Wilkins had placed his traps for pigeons, and Hugh had taken\r\nup a root of the still small potatoes, they returned to the cave,\r\nheavily laden with good things.\r\n\r\nDay after day they brought in fruit and grain to add to the stores, and\r\ncaptured a number of fine pigeons, for which Jack wattled off a niche in\r\nthe cave, and they were supplied with grass and brushwood for nests, and\r\ngrain for food, to induce them to settle quietly. It was impossible in\r\nthis climate to keep animal food eatable for more than two days; but so\r\nlong as they had grain and potatoes they knew that they could live,\r\nprovided they could secure a constant supply of water.\r\n\r\nThis was their most perplexing difficulty; and even amidst the rain the\r\nstony lining of the reservoir was taken up that they might bore the\r\nground beneath it with long poles. Up to the waist in water, they bored\r\nineffectually for an hour, the pole always striking against the solid\r\nrock. At length the pole passed through, there was an accidental opening\r\nin the rock, and the party who watched in the caves below, saw, with\r\ndelight, the water trickle through into a recess some distance from the\r\nentrance. Then they all descended, to sink a well in the soft sandy\r\nfloor of the cave, which they lined with slabs, and looked on with\r\npleasure as this little reservoir gradually filled from the pool above,\r\nwhich the continual rains kept constantly filled with water.\r\n\r\nIt was ten days before all these labors were fully accomplished; then a\r\ndry day succeeded, and every hand was actively employed in digging up,\r\ncarrying off, and storing the potatoes, which were of good size, and an\r\nabundant crop. They had made a number of bags of a flexible bark for\r\ncontaining stores; but now so many were filled that Margaret was afraid,\r\nif they had to set out soon, they should be unable to carry all off.\r\n\r\nThen, after ascertaining the undisturbed solitude of the plain beyond\r\nthe wood, Arthur and Wilkins set out in hopes of procuring a change of\r\nfood; but no kangaroos or emus were in sight, and they feared to venture\r\nfar from their place of refuge. They shot some opossums, filled one bag\r\nwith the leaves of the tea-shrub, at the particular request of Jenny,\r\nand another with the leaves of a salt plant, which seemed to have sprung\r\nup after the rain, and which Arthur was glad to carry off, that he might\r\ntry an experiment of which he had read.\r\n\r\n\"But, I say, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins, \"we've gone and made a bad job\r\nof it; just look ye here, we've niver thought that we were leaving a\r\ntrack, and here it is on this plashy bog, and no mistake. We might just\r\nas well have hung out a sign-post, to ask blacky to walk in.\"\r\n\r\nArthur was much vexed at his own carelessness, but he saw nothing could\r\nnow be done but to endeavor to confuse the track as much as possible,\r\nand he arranged with Wilkins that they should separate, branch off in\r\ndifferent directions, and finally they made a circuit opposite to each\r\nother round the wood, that the weak point might not be discovered.\r\n\r\n\"Ye see, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins before they separated, \"if Peter has\r\nan inkling that we're aback of these trees, he'd soon cut his way\r\nthrough, with a bit of help. But then, them fools of black fellows are\r\nas bad as our fond lass Ruth; they're flayed out of their wits of this\r\nwood, and they'll be shy of coming nigh hand it. I ken a good bit of\r\ntheir talk, ye see, but I'se a bad hand at framing their queer\r\nchirruping words. I heard 'em tell of bad sperrits as haunted this wood.\r\nBut Black Peter's set on getting haud of t' master's money, and guns,\r\nand powder, and such like, and he's not good to put down. I seed Master\r\nHugh's rifle as soon as they pulled me into that hole, and kept an eye\r\non't. It were no use to them, for they'd no powder; and I said to\r\nmyself, if God please to loose me, that gun goes wi' me.\"\r\n\r\nThey then parted to move round the dark forest, and during his walk,\r\nArthur was alarmed to see smoke from the wood in which the cave of the\r\nsavages lay; and before he reached the opening, he heard their curious\r\nand unwelcome cry, which proclaimed that the foe was near, and he\r\nfeared, watching their movements, and now deeply regretted that they had\r\nleft their retreat. Gladly they returned to it, and doubly secured the\r\nentrance, determining to keep an incessant watch, lest they should be\r\nsurprised in their citadel.\r\n\r\nOn their return they found that Jack, assisted by Hugh and Gerald, had\r\nformed an oven, lined with slabs, on the hearth where the cooking-fire\r\nwas usually made, and Jenny was preparing cakes of bruised oats, and a\r\npigeon-pie made in a large oyster-shell, and covered with potatoes, to\r\nbe baked in the new oven. The flesh of the opossum was not relished by\r\nany of the party. Jenny declared she would just as soon eat a monkey;\r\nRuth was afraid to touch one, even before it was cooked; and Mr.\r\nMayburn, after a long lecture to prove that the flesh must certainly be\r\nwholesome, from the habits and the vegetable diet of the class of\r\nanimals to which it belonged, concluded by declining, himself, to eat\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" he said, \"I am not prejudiced by the vulgar error of\r\nconfounding this little creature with the ugly opossum of America, to\r\nwhich it bears no resemblance, except in its marsupial formation and its\r\nplayful habits. In fact, the graceful form, delicate color, and\r\nextraordinary agility of this beautiful animal, seem to rank it rather\r\nwith the squirrels; and from the lateral folds of membrane, which it has\r\nthe power to expand, in order to support its flying leaps through the\r\nair, it has been named by some travellers the 'flying squirrel,' though\r\ndistinct from the American squirrel, and, like all the quadrupeds of the\r\ncountry, exclusively Australian.\"\r\n\r\nThe pretty delicate gray skins were carefully preserved, to be sewed\r\ntogether for cloaks; and the hungry boys did not disdain a stew of\r\nopossums, which they declared was quite as good as rabbit. But previous\r\nto the cookery, Arthur showed his father the new salt-shrub; and the\r\nlarge and peculiar form of the leaves enabled them to decide that it\r\nmust be Brown's _Rhagodia Parabolica_, the leaves of which are edible.\r\nAnxious to make the experiment, the leaves were boiled for some time,\r\nstrained, and the liquor filtered and evaporated several times, and at\r\nlength the exposure to great heat produced some crystals of salt, to the\r\ndelight of the young chemists, and still more to the content of Jenny,\r\nwho treasured the precious salt, which had so long been the grand\r\ndeficiency in her cookery. The leaves themselves were added to the stew,\r\nand not only communicating a salt flavor to the insipid meat, but formed\r\na tender vegetable, tasting like spinach; and it was determined to omit\r\nno opportunity of searching for this valuable plant.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation and enjoyment of their abundant food, they did not\r\nneglect the necessary precautions for concealing their retreat. All the\r\npotato stalks were thrown into the cave, for fuel, and the ground was\r\nsmoothed over as much as possible, and strewn with stones, that the\r\ntraces of cultivation might haply escape observation; a watch was\r\ncontinually kept on the heights, and every opening that lighted the\r\ncave, with the exception of some narrow crevices, was carefully covered\r\nwith a slab of stone beneath the brush, lest an accident similar to that\r\nwhich befell O'Brien should lead their enemies to discover the\r\nsubterranean hollow.\r\n\r\nThis precaution rendered their abode gloomy, though they left the\r\nprincipal opening--the entrance--uncovered till any serious cause of\r\nalarm should render it prudent to enclose themselves entirely; and when\r\na cessation of the rain permitted them, they all gladly remained in the\r\nopen air, enjoying the perfume of the revived vegetation, and the joyful\r\nnotes of thousands of birds which sported in the air, fluttered on the\r\ntrees, or clamored noisily round the pools of water, plunging their\r\nbeaks into the mud for the worms and reptiles on which they fed. These\r\ncreatures supplied the family with unfailing food, and afforded Mr.\r\nMayburn constant amusement in studying their various habits.\r\n\r\nBut a cessation of rain brought to them also a certain increase of\r\nperil. The natives were seen spreading over the plain below, hunting the\r\nkangaroo or opossum; and _Black_ Peter, himself, easily distinguished,\r\nas Gerald said, because he was _white_, was observed stooping down, as\r\nArthur suspected, to scrutinize the track, which he feared the rain had\r\nfailed to obliterate. Still, occasionally heavy showers fell, and\r\ndispersed the people, who shrink from rain; and it was not till one\r\nmorning, when none was actually falling, though dark clouds hid the sun,\r\nthat the whole force of the savages, certainly exceeding fifty men,\r\nappeared crossing the plain; following slowly, and it seemed\r\nreluctantly, their debased chief, Black Peter.\r\n\r\nWhen they had approached within a hundred yards of the forest, the\r\nnatives halted at once, and Peter, after speaking some words to them,\r\nbegan again to examine the perplexed track, and drawing close to the\r\ntrees, followed it round the whole boundary, apparently puzzled and\r\nenraged. At length he paused not far from the real entrance, and\r\nswinging round his axe above his head, he called out loudly to the\r\npeople. They answered by throwing their axes on the ground, and\r\nremaining erect and motionless. The watchers above distinctly heard\r\nrepeated strokes of the axe on the hard pine-trees; but they were well\r\nconvinced that the efforts of one man alone could not accomplish an\r\nentrance, even for many days, and therefore felt comparatively\r\ntranquillized.\r\n\r\nStill there was the absolute conviction that they were in a state of\r\nsiege; that this man was of indomitable determination, of cruel and\r\ndepraved nature, and that ultimately his obstinacy might bend even the\r\ntimid savages to his will. And at this thought, fear and anxiety stole\r\nover every heart. Mr. Mayburn was persuaded to remain in the cave with\r\nMargaret and the three women, the sentinels promising to send reports of\r\nthe progress of affairs to them, while, with tears and prayers they\r\nwaited the result.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins, \"just let me say my say. We've t' best\r\non't yet: let's keep yon pass again all them rogues, and see which side\r\ntires first. We'll cut a canny hole to fire through at 'em, and load one\r\ngun after another; and as ye 're a bit soft-hearted yersel', ye maun\r\njust let me be front-rank man, and I'se pick off my chaps, reet and\r\nleft, till there's not a rogue can stand again us. Folks say as how\r\nPeter's charmed; but I'se have a blaze at him, onyhow, and see if I\r\ncan't stop his mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be capital!\" cried Gerald. \"And let us dig trenches, Arthur,\r\nand then won't we pepper the rascals snugly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But these savages are not rascals, Gerald,\" said Arthur; \"they are only\r\nignorant wretches, misled by a rascal. To fire on them from an ambush\r\nwould be cold-blooded murder, which papa would never sanction. We have\r\nno right deliberately to destroy so many human lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye're a real soft un, master,\" said Wilkins. \"What's a few savages?\r\nBless ye, t' country round about teems with 'em; they'll niver be\r\nmissed!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Arthur could not be persuaded that it was expedient or\r\nexcusable to destroy the surplus population of savages; and he preferred\r\nto reserve his charges for absolute defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nPeter's last Stratagem.--Firing the Fortress.--The Watch-tower.--The\r\nWelcome Rain.--The close Siege.--The Conflict.--The Defeat of\r\nPeter.--The Fortress abandoned.--Once more on the Road.--Resting in the\r\nWilds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now they observed that Peter had returned to his party, and was\r\ntalking to them with violent gesticulation; continually pointing to the\r\nwood, and waving them forward. The men drew nearer, and gathered round a\r\nthicket of low bushes, where they appeared busily engaged for a few\r\nminutes. Then the watchful sentinels saw, to their great dismay, many\r\nburning brands, one after another, flame up in the hands of the natives,\r\nwho now rush boldly forward to cast them among the underwood of the\r\nforest. This was indeed a fearful sight, and no time was lost in\r\nretreating to the cave, where, after Arthur had carefully observed that\r\nno track was left to the spot, they all entered; a slab was introduced\r\nover the opening, beneath the brushwood, and now only small interstices\r\nwere left to admit air and faint gleams of light to the agitated party\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nWhen the terrific mode of penetrating their fortress was told to Mr.\r\nMayburn, and the reality of the obstinate siege burst upon him, stunned\r\nwith horror, he remained speechless and motionless till Margaret roused\r\nhim, by entreaties that he would pray for them.\r\n\r\n\"I will pray, my child,\" said he, \"I will pray for speedy death; for\r\ndeath is inevitably our doom, and, alas! in its most frightful form.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will they burn us alive, Miss Marget?\" shrieked Ruth; \"and my bonnie\r\nhens, and them poor pigeons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent, Ruth,\" said Margaret. \"God is great in power. It may be His\r\nwill yet to save us, if we pray to Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are caves within caves here, Meggie,\" said Hugh. \"Gerald and I\r\nknow some queer corners, and we may escape beyond their discovery; and I\r\nmake no doubt we may even cut our way through in some other part of the\r\nhollow, if we can only hold out long enough, and puzzle these fellows.\"\r\n\r\nBut the temporary depression of Mr. Mayburn had now left him; he had\r\nrecovered his firmness and faith in God; and he summoned round him his\r\nagitated family, to join him in fervent prayer for help and protection\r\nin this hour of extreme need. He spoke to them long and earnestly, not\r\ndenying his own weakness; and besought each to contend with his\r\nbesetting sin: the strong must yield to His will; the weak must ask for\r\nfortitude; the erring must resolve to forsake his sins; and the\r\ndesponding must trust wholly to Him who was mighty to save and merciful\r\nto the oppressed.\r\n\r\n\"We are now, my children,\" he added, \"wanderers, as were his chosen\r\npeople in the wilderness. Let us, then, remember the marvellous works\r\nthat He hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.\"\r\n\r\nComposed and hopeful, after their religious exercise the besieged began\r\nto examine their defences and their resources. The powder had been\r\ncarefully preserved in a solid rocky niche, where no stray spark could\r\npossibly reach it. The provision, though simple, was abundant--the\r\nstore of potatoes alone seemed inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n\"We can surely live,\" said O'Brien, \"like thousands of my careless,\r\nhealthy countrymen, on the _pratee!_ and defy famine. And, please,\r\nGeneral Arthur, to come and see the watch-tower that Hugh and I have\r\nfound out.\"\r\n\r\nArthur followed the restless boys, who carried off the ladder with them,\r\nthrough many a narrow winding, till they reached a very lofty hollow.\r\nHere the boys rested their ladder, and ascended as high as they could\r\nwith its assistance, after which they climbed the rugged wall till a\r\nprojecting ledge enabled them to stand; and when Arthur joined them,\r\nthey pointed out to him some horizontal crannies between the strata of\r\nthe stone, through which he looked down upon the table land of the\r\nmountain; and he perceived that this rock formed the parapet, or\r\nboundary wall of the crater.\r\n\r\nThey were thus enabled to survey their own hitherto peaceful domain, as\r\nwell as the surrounding wood, from which a dense smoke was now rising.\r\nThe moist and green trees had long refused to blaze, but at length, as\r\nthe boys were silently and anxiously watching, they saw the red threads\r\ncrawl through the black clouds; they heard the loud crackling of dried\r\nbranches; and finally the broad flames rose majestically above the dark\r\ntrees, and spread rapidly towards the east side of the mountain, urged\r\nby a west wind. The roaring of the flames, the noise of falling timber,\r\nthe screams and discordant cries of hundreds of disturbed and affrighted\r\nbirds, which continued to wheel, as if fascinated, over the flames,\r\nprevented any sound of human voices being audible; and the actors in\r\nthe frightful devastation were alike unseen and unheard.\r\n\r\nHugh sobbed with grief as he watched numbers of his favorite birds,\r\nsuffocated with the thick smoke, fall down senseless; Gerald exclaimed\r\nagainst the destruction of the ripe oats in the glade below, which were\r\nnow blazing fiercely; and Arthur, pale and agitated, saw the fearful\r\nconflagration rapidly spreading up the side of the mountain, and dreaded\r\nthe moment when, the brushwood being consumed above the cave, the slabs\r\nthat covered the entrance must inevitably be detected, and they must\r\nsubmit to be baited in their last hold.\r\n\r\n\"Arthur, what shall we do?\" exclaimed Hugh, \"for the fire is running up\r\nthe brush at the side of the mountain. See, now, it blazes over the\r\nedge; it has caught a heap of potato stalks that I was so careless as to\r\nleave there. Gerald, there are Margaret's favorite parterres all\r\nblazing,--the scarlet geranium, the blue convolvulus, and the sweet,\r\nhome-like jasmine. How she will grieve! But, I forget, we have more to\r\ngrieve for; already the sparks are falling on the bush over our grotto!\r\nWhat will become of Margaret and papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must go to them,\" replied Arthur. \"We have seen the worst that can\r\nhappen; it is useless remaining here. Let us comfort them, and lead them\r\ninto the deepest recesses of the mountain. We may, at least, escape the\r\nfearful effects of the conflagration.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then, Arthur,\" said Hugh, \"we may surely defend them with our guns.\r\nIt will be a just cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will! it will!\" answered Arthur. \"God send that we may not be called\r\non to shed blood; but I believe we should be justified in doing it. Do\r\nyou yet see the enemy, Gerald?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Arthur; but God is good to us,\" said Gerald. \"The rain is falling\r\nagain, and our dear Black Forest will not be entirely consumed; and\r\nperhaps we may have opportunity to escape.\"\r\n\r\nThe rain re-commenced suddenly, and so heavily, that in a short time the\r\nblazing conflagration was extinguished, and the progress of the invaders\r\narrested; for, when the boys joined their trembling friends, Wilkins\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n\"Depend on 't they've crept into some hole or other; they're just\r\ndownreet cowards about a drop of rain, for all their running about\r\nwithout a rag to their backs.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we cannot exist long in this state of misery,\" said Mr. Mayburn.\r\n\"What would you advise, Arthur?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say, dear papa,\" answered he, \"that we must defend our\r\nposition as long as it is tenable, and then have all prepared, and\r\nattempt a retreat--a dangerous but inevitable measure. Jack will point\r\nout the most convenient mode of making up packages for carrying away. We\r\nmust, if possible, take our potatoes, for we may meet with a sterile\r\nregion.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the hens and chickens,\" added Ruth, imploringly.\r\n\r\n\"We had certainly better release them,\" he replied, with a smile, \"and\r\nintroduce a new race into the country; or else roast them and make them\r\nuseful.\"\r\n\r\nBut Ruth so pathetically and earnestly begged to be allowed to carry her\r\n\"bonnie bit chicks,\" that, on the promise that the young ones should be\r\ngiven up to be eaten, in case of need, she was permitted to encumber\r\nherself with her favorites. Jack made her a light basket for them, of a\r\nportable form; he then proceeded to pack, compress, and arrange the\r\nbaggage in convenient burdens for each; while Jenny baked in the oven,\r\nwhich she greatly regretted having to abandon, a sufficient quantity of\r\nbiscuits to fill two large bags. The boots had all been thoroughly\r\nrepaired during the rains; and, as it was probable they would have to\r\nset out before the weather was settled, the skins of the opossums were\r\nsewed into cloaks, to protect them.\r\n\r\nThus, during one day of continuous rain, when no signs of the savages\r\nwere seen, they were able to make all ready for the flight, which was\r\nnow become absolutely necessary; and it was proposed that the next\r\nmorning, though the clouds still threatened a continuance of rain, they\r\nshould make a last substantial breakfast in their secure sanctuary, and\r\nthen set out at once. The breakfast was eaten, and the burdens\r\napportioned; but, before they ventured to emerge, the boys ran off to\r\ntake a survey of the plains from their watch-tower, and hastily returned\r\nto announce the vexatious intelligence that the whole body of the\r\nsavages had passed through the devastated forest, and were already\r\nascending the side of the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"Now for the defence!\" exclaimed Hugh, seizing his gun, and placing the\r\nladder at the opening.\r\n\r\n\"Remove the ladder, Hugh,\" said Arthur. \"Remember that papa has given\r\nall authority to me. Do nothing but what I command.\"\r\n\r\nHugh made a grimace, and touched his cap.\r\n\r\n\"You, Gerald, had better go to the watch-tower,\" continued Arthur.\r\n\"Margaret and papa, Jenny, Ruth, Baldabella, and the child, will\r\naccompany you. We shall have sufficient force to defend the cave here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Margaret can watch. Do let me have some work, Arthur,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, you shall be _aide-de-camp_, and bring me the reports\r\nof sentinel Margaret. Away! away!\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\nMargaret was placed on the ledge, to watch, and reported that Peter,\r\nfollowed by the unwilling savages, was already on the height. She saw\r\nthe keen-eyed convict examine the ground, and take up a scorched\r\npotato-stalk, with some of the bulbs hanging to it, which had been\r\nimprudently left. He then went forward to the stone-lined reservoir,\r\nwhich was plainly the work of man; and pointed it out to his followers,\r\nas well as some tracks on the soft earth. The natives, however, looked\r\nsullen, did not reply, but gazed anxiously round, as if expecting some\r\nunusual appearance; and all shrunk together beneath the rocky wall in\r\nwhich the watchers were concealed.\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret communicated her observations, Baldabella said, \"Black\r\nfellow look for _Bayl-yas_--bad spirit; they not know good white man\r\npray, send _Bayl-yas_ away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Meggie,\" said Gerald, springing up the ladder to her side; \"I'll\r\ngive them a fright, and disperse them;\" and the imprudent boy uttered a\r\ndeep unearthly groan. In a moment the men darted forward, and were\r\nspringing down the steep, when the commanding voice of their leader\r\nrecalled them; and Margaret, with much vexation, saw that he was\r\nexplaining the cause of their alarm, for he pointed to the spot where\r\nshe stood, in a menacing manner. He continued to speak to the men in a\r\ntone of exultation, waving his arms, till he induced them to return and\r\naccompany him in his search.\r\n\r\n\"Away, at once, foolish boy,\" said Margaret; \"and tell Arthur all we\r\nhave seen, and your imprudent act. They will not leave the spot now,\r\ntill they have found our hiding-place.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Gerald, completely crest-fallen, hastened to make his report and\r\nhis confession; and Arthur saw plainly they should now be obliged to\r\nhave recourse to arms. He ordered Hugh to wait till he should have fired\r\noff his two barrels, and then to take his place till he should have time\r\nto reload. The ammunition was put in charge of Wilkins and Jack to serve\r\nout; and cruel as was the necessity, Arthur trusted they might thus\r\ndefend their position, and weary out even the malignant and stubborn\r\nconvict.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt discovery must soon take place, as the light by\r\ndegrees poured into the cave, through the small openings which the\r\nsavages uncovered one after another. Still Peter saw none of these could\r\npossibly be the entrance to any concealment; but at length he stepped on\r\nthe large slab; it was immediately removed, and a shout of exultation\r\narose, as the large chasm pointed out the retreat of the persecuted\r\nfamily. For a moment there was a pause: even if the descent had been\r\neasy, the men were not so rash as to throw themselves into the clutches\r\nof their foes below, and spears directed against an unseen enemy would\r\nbe wasted. Then Peter leaned over the opening, and called out,--\r\n\r\n\"Come on, ye cowards, and fight fairly if ye can, or else hand up them\r\nguns, wi' yer powder and cash, and then cut off, vagabonds as ye are,\r\nor I'll make this den ower hot to haud ye.\"\r\n\r\nArthur made a sign of silence, for he saw Wilkins was impatient and very\r\nmuch inclined to indulge in pouring out invectives against his former\r\ncompanion. Then a few spears and stones were flung down at random, which\r\nwere easily avoided by the besieged, who had ensconced themselves in\r\nniches of the rock, and the light-hearted boys could scarcely restrain\r\ntheir laughter at the futile attempts. But the resolute convict was not\r\nto be baffled; he was heard speaking to his followers in their own\r\nlanguage, and Baldabella was placed near enough to hear and interpret.\r\nWhen she had listened a few minutes, she turned to Arthur with a look of\r\nterror, and said,--\"Bad Peter say, 'Burn all! burn white jin! black jin!\r\nNakinna! good master! all burn!'\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment confirmed the woman's report, for flaming brands thrown\r\ninto the cave announced the desperate plan of the besiegers. Arthur\r\ncalled for water, and buckets of water were brought to quench each brand\r\nas it fell; but the suffocating smoke in that confined spot was\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n\"We must end this nuisance, or we shall be stifled,\" said Arthur; and as\r\nPeter himself, with an armful of kindled brushwood, bent over to cast it\r\nbelow, Arthur fired on him, and the man fell back beneath the flaming\r\nbranches, which were scattered over him; then calling for the ladder,\r\nwhich had been brought near, the intrepid youth mounted to the opening,\r\nfired again into the midst of the assembled savages, and, rapidly\r\ndescending, removed the ladder.\r\n\r\nThe yells and groans they heard from above afforded sufficient proof\r\nthat the shots had taken effect, and Hugh and Gerald were sent to the\r\nwatch-tower to make observations. They saw that Peter was able to stand,\r\nsupported by two men, but his right arm appeared to be powerless; a\r\nwound in the shoulder was bleeding, and he was raging and stamping with\r\nagony, evidently from the burns he had received, for the savages were\r\napplying some leaves to his breast and face.\r\n\r\n\"I have never had a shot yet,\" said Hugh, when he returned. \"It is very\r\nhard, Arthur--pray let me run up the ladder and scatter a few of the\r\nrascals.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! my dear Hugh,\" answered Arthur; \"such a measure would be wanton\r\nand inhuman at this moment. These wretched savages are mere machines in\r\nthe hands of the villain whose own cruel designs have recoiled on\r\nhimself. If they had never met this man, they might perhaps have been\r\ntroublesome and annoying to us, but a little experience of our superior\r\nknowledge and power would have relieved us from them. Now even, they are\r\nnot detained near us from choice, for they evidently abhor and dread the\r\nplace, but they stay to fulfil the duties of humanity to this wretch who\r\nhas so unaccountably beguiled them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell ye how he came round 'em, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins. \"I\r\nheared 'em say when I were chained up yonder, as how that good-to-nought\r\nwere a head man, and husband to one of their jins, and he'd been speared\r\nand killed outreet by some black fellows down south, and now he were\r\nsent back to 'em wi' a white skin. Peter made 'em swallow all that\r\nrigmarole, cunning dog as he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have read,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"that some of these ignorant tribes\r\nhave such an extraordinary superstition: believing that the souls of the\r\ndeparted revisit the earth in the form of white men. There is blended\r\nwith this faith a strange recognition of the doctrine of immortality,\r\nand, we might hope, of regeneration; but the crimes of this wretch in\r\nthat which they believe to be his second life must have startled even\r\nthe untaught heathens whom he has thus deceived.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're off, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins, who had ascended to the opening\r\nto look round; \"there's not a soul left. I reckon they'd be right glad\r\nto quit; and that rogue Peter's not in a way to trouble us for one bit;\r\nso, what say ye, master, if we were to bolt afore they'd settled what to\r\ndo? Here's t' mistress seems all ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite ready, Wilkins,\" said Margaret, \"and agree with you. It\r\nappears to me, Arthur, that our best hope is, to snatch this opportunity\r\nto get the advantage of a few hours' start, that we may not be easily\r\novertaken when that wicked man is sufficiently recovered to take the\r\nfield again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mind, Mr. Arthur, sharp's t' word,\" said Wilkins, \"if we want to\r\nbeat him. He let me into his schemes a bit, as how he meant to get them\r\nfellows after him down south to join a lot of bush-rangers as was to\r\nmeet him. Ye see, we're not top walkers, at no time; and wi' all this\r\nstuff to hug, we'd better be trotting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make ready!\" cried Gerald, tying on his knapsack of bark, and putting\r\ninto one pocket a canister of powder, and into the other a bag of shot;\r\n\"we must trot, as Wilkins says, as well as fellows can trot carrying\r\nsuch burdens as ours. I say, Arty, haven't I got my share?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have indeed, my boy,\" answered Arthur. \"I fear you will not be able\r\nto get on long under such a heavy burden; but we must try, at first\r\nhowever, to carry as much away as we can bear. Take your bow to support\r\nyou, and mount the ladder. Now, Hugh.\"\r\n\r\nHugh was similarly laden, but carried a gun instead of a bow. Ruth would\r\nnot resign her fowls, and had in addition the serious weight of a large\r\nbag of potatoes. Margaret, Jenny, and Baldabella carried the bread and\r\nthe remainder of the potatoes, the poor native having in addition the\r\ncharge of her child. Mr. Mayburn was laden with the shells and buckets\r\nwhich constituted their household furniture; and Arthur, Wilkins, and\r\nJack cleared off all the rest of the weapons and bags. The descent to\r\nthe plains had been rendered easy by the conflagration, which had almost\r\nentirely destroyed the forest, and the travellers chose their path in a\r\ndirection opposite to the wood which was the abode of the natives. They\r\ntoiled on with swift feet and anxious hearts, scarcely conscious of\r\ntheir heavy burdens, for two hours; in which time they had left their\r\ndesolated sanctuary far away to the north.\r\n\r\nThe ground was level and fertile, and the weather favorable; for the sun\r\nwas overclouded, though no rain was falling; and relaxing their extreme\r\nspeed, they still continued to walk on, till downright fatigue and\r\nhunger pointed out the necessity of rest. The best place for their\r\nencampment that they could select was in the midst of a thicket of the\r\ntea-shrub and other low brushwood. The young men with their axes cleared\r\na spot for a fire, and niches for sleeping-places; they plucked the\r\nfresh leaves from the plants to make tea, and enjoyed their coarse\r\nbiscuit, soothed by the silver tones of the bell-bird, the musical\r\npiping of the organ-magpie, and the soft cry of an invisible bird, the\r\ncurious notes of which resembled those of the curlew.\r\n\r\nNight fell on them with all the beauty of the tropical regions; the soft\r\nbreeze loaded with fragrance from the luxuriant flowers revived by the\r\nrecent rains, the bright stars above their heads, the brilliant\r\nfire-flies floating round them, the dying notes of the half hushed\r\nbirds, the incessant hum of the restless insect tribes; all was harmony,\r\ninspiring devout and holy thoughts; and the weary travellers slept\r\nhappily and trustfully till morning awoke them to resume their labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nA Bark Sledge.--The Friendly Tribe.--The Wild Melon.--A Nocturnal\r\nAlarm.--The Wombats.--The Bivouac on the Heath.--The Savages\r\nagain.--Away to the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe women had prepared breakfast, and Arthur was becoming impatient,\r\nbefore Jack and the two young boys appeared, dragging after them a large\r\nsheet of bark, to which they had attached ropes.\r\n\r\n\"It was Jack's thought!\" exclaimed Gerald. \"Is it not a capital\r\nplan?--the baggage-wagon! Off with your knapsack, Arty; Jenny, bring\r\nyour pots and pans. Every thing must be tied on our sledge, and we will\r\ndraw it in turns--two men to form a team.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be a great relief, certainly,\" said Arthur, \"so long as the\r\nplains continue tolerably clear and level; but, I fear, over the matted\r\nbrush or the rugged mountain we shall find it useless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then, Mr. Arthur,\" said Jack, \"it will only be taking up our loads\r\na bit, and leaving the sledge. We can soon cut another sheet when the\r\nroad gets smoother.\"\r\n\r\nThe sledge answered admirably, and, relieved from their burdens, they\r\nwent on for several days, over well-watered and well-wooded plains,\r\nwithout interruption, and without delay, except when the disengaged\r\nyouths lingered behind to shoot a few pheasants or cockatoos, that the\r\nbread might not be too soon exhausted. In a week after they had left the\r\ncave, they saw kangaroos again, and even the sledge was abandoned, that\r\nall might join in the chase. After a long hunt, they succeeded in\r\nkilling one; and the weather being now less sultry, they were able to\r\npreserve the meat for two days. The skin was cleaned and dried, and then\r\nconverted into bags for the biscuit, for showers of rain still fell\r\noccasionally, and they had been compelled to take off their cloaks to\r\nprotect their valuable food.\r\n\r\nOne evening, an unwelcome return of the heavy rain induced them to look\r\nanxiously round for some shelter, and turning round a clump of tall\r\nbushes, they came suddenly on a cluster of scattered huts, formed of\r\ngreen boughs and open in front. Beneath these canopies several women,\r\nwearing cloaks of fur, were employed in pounding grain or nuts between\r\ntwo stones, while they sung some song in a low, musical tone, and in\r\nperfect harmony.\r\n\r\nOutside the huts stood several tall men. They had a single loose garment\r\nof fur cast round them, but the bust was wholly uncovered, and marked by\r\nmany raised cicatrices. They were engaged in making arrows or spears,\r\nand never raised their heads from their employment; but, with the usual\r\ndignified indifference of the savage, did not appear to notice the\r\napproach of the strangers, though probably they had never before seen\r\nthe white man. Even the women continued their work and their song; and\r\nit was only when Baldabella, who had been introduced by her protectors,\r\nwent forward, holding her child, to ask the women to give some good\r\nwhite people shelter from the rain in their huts, that the men turned to\r\nlisten, and the women suspended their labor. The head of the family,\r\npointing out an empty hut, spoke to Baldabella, and said, as she\r\ninterpreted his words, \"That very good for white man; for black man;\r\nplenty rain make much cold.\"\r\n\r\nGlad of the refuge, while Baldabella remained to talk to the women of\r\nthe tribe, the rest took possession of the slight hut, and prepared\r\ntheir supper of the remains of the kangaroo, of which they invited their\r\nfriendly hosts to partake. The natives now assembled round them with\r\nsome curiosity, tasted the seethed kangaroo, and seemed to relish it;\r\nrejected the roasted potatoes with disgust, but greedily enjoyed the\r\nbiscuit, especially the jumbles, as the boys called them, which were\r\nflavored with the juice of the figs.\r\n\r\nThen the women in return for this hospitality, brought to them some\r\npods, which Arthur recognized to be the fruit of the _Acacia\r\nstenophylla_, the seeds, or nuts, resembling in flavor the cachou-nut.\r\nThey brought also a small melon, or cucumber, now ripe and sweet, with\r\nwhich the plains that the travellers had crossed this day had been\r\ncovered; but they had not ventured to eat it till now, when they saw how\r\nthe natives enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n\"It certainly belongs to one of the most useful orders of plants\r\nconsidered as the food of man,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"and, as far as I can\r\ndetermine from recollection, I believe it to be the _Cucumis pubescens_.\r\nThis is truly a country of rich and abundant resources; wanting but the\r\nlight of civilization and religion to render it a paradise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, papa,\" said Margaret, \"our countrymen acted unwisely when they\r\nsuffered the first steps into these lovely and untrodden wilds to be\r\nmade by the vilest of criminals. Alas! alas! what must the ignorant\r\nnatives think of such Christian missionaries!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was an error, Margaret,\" answered her father, \"wide in its mischief,\r\nfatal in its results; and generations must pass away before the error\r\ncan be rectified. But a purer and holier influence is at work; and, in\r\nhis own good time, God will assuredly enlighten the people, through the\r\nefforts of his faithful servants. Would that I were able to take my\r\nshare in the great work! but, alas! I am but the barren fig-tree, and\r\ncontinually I hear that awful sentence ringing in my ear, 'Cut it down;\r\nwhy cumbereth it the ground?'\"\r\n\r\nThe earnest father then called on his family to kneel in prayer, while\r\nthe natives stood round in silent wonder, especially when they remarked\r\nthe devout demeanor of Baldabella, and heard the little child murmuring\r\nin English the responses, in imitation of her kind teachers. After\r\nprayers the women seemed to be earnestly questioning Baldabella; and\r\nMargaret was pleased to hear the woman speak long and earnestly to the\r\nquestioners, for she was convinced that Baldabella was truly a Christian\r\nin faith, so far as her simple mind could comprehend the faith.\r\n\r\nThough they considered it prudent to keep a watch, the sleep of the\r\nfamily was not disturbed by any fears, for these natives seemed quiet\r\nand inoffensive; and through Baldabella they learnt that they had ever\r\nshunned the restless and destructive tribes to the north, and a still\r\nmore dangerous people, whom they spoke of with terror, as the tribes of\r\nthe \"Great River,\" to the south. But, the interpreter added, they did\r\nnot like the white people who came to kill the _menuah_, as they named\r\nthe kangaroo; and the emu, and to carry off their weapons. But they were\r\nsatisfied that these white strangers were peaceful like themselves, and\r\nthey wished them well, and would show them the way through the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe weary travellers gratefully accepted this offer, for the prospect of\r\nhaving to ascend, without guidance, a line of mountains which cut off\r\ntheir progress to the south, and of being compelled to resume their\r\nheavy burdens, was alarming. Early in the morning they sought the women,\r\nto present them with some biscuit and with a pair of fowls, of which\r\nBaldabella undertook to explain the great usefulness, and the domestic\r\nhabits and proper mode of feeding.\r\n\r\nThen they once more set out, guided by the chief among the natives; and\r\nhaving skirted the mountains for three or four miles to the east, found\r\na narrow gorge, through which a shallow rill ran towards the south,\r\nalong the flowery margin of which they passed till they came upon\r\nanother wide plain, less wooded and fertile than that which they had\r\nleft, but grown over with the _Cucumis_ laden with fruit. This plain was\r\nperforated with dangerous holes, which their guide told them were the\r\ndens of a large animal, very fierce, which he called the Wombat, and\r\nwhich the boys were filled with a great desire to encounter and\r\nvanquish.\r\n\r\nOnce on the plains, the native pointed out the direction which they were\r\nto follow, greatly to the east of south. He shook his head when they\r\nintimated their wish to proceed due south, and, according to Baldabella,\r\ndeclared there was \"no water\"--a most important objection to the route.\r\nArthur gave the man one of the table-knives, much to the discontent of\r\nJenny and the great delight of the receiver; and the gratified native\r\nstood watching them for some time, and then slowly returned to his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"Now for the wombats!\" exclaimed Gerald, looking anxiously down into one\r\nof the dens of these unknown animals. But all was still and dark; and\r\nArthur begged that there might be no delay, as, in all probability, the\r\nanimals could only be drawn from their retreats by dogs, or be surprised\r\nby long watching, and time was now too precious to be spent on such an\r\nuncertain pursuit. Continuing, therefore, to follow the course of the\r\nslender rivulet, which, however, soon became but a chain of pools, they\r\ntravelled for several miles, eating, as they went on, the juicy melons,\r\nas they called the _Cucumis_, till the sight of a smoke in the direction\r\nof the pools induced them reluctantly to forsake even this small supply\r\nof water, and to diverge directly to the south, till they should have\r\npassed the danger of encountering another tribe, who might prove less\r\nfriendly than their late hosts.\r\n\r\nThe sudden fall of night compelled them to rest at a spot where no water\r\nwas to be discovered, and, too late, they regretted that they had not\r\nbrought a supply from the pools. Reluctantly they made their only meal\r\nof the day on bread; fortunately they were able to add melons; still the\r\nprivation was felt; they were unsatisfied and much depressed, till\r\ncalmed by the blessed influence of prayer. Then all anxiety was hushed\r\nby a sound sleep on the wide, treeless plain.\r\n\r\nThey had slept some hours, when Arthur was awaked by a startling cry,\r\nand, springing up in alarm, he seized his gun, and called hastily to\r\nJack to follow him. The moon was shining brightly, and they were enabled\r\nto see some moving objects at no great distance, towards which they\r\nquickly directed their steps, and, on drawing near, they heard the voice\r\nof O'Brien crying out, \"Arthur! Arthur! come and kill these frightful\r\nbeasts! I shall be worried!\"\r\n\r\nThey now saw the head of O'Brien, who, supported only by his hands, had\r\nsunk into a hole or den, and was surrounded by a troop of hideous large\r\nanimals, with the form of a bear and the nose of a badger. They were\r\nactually running over the boy, and apparently very uneasy at his\r\nintrusion. Jack's spear soon despatched one of the animals; the rest\r\nfled to their dens at the sight of more invaders of their homes; and\r\nO'Brien was dragged from the hole he had accidentally taken possession\r\nof, and scolded by Arthur for his imprudence. It appeared that he had,\r\nwhile lying awake, seen one of the wombats roaming about in search of\r\nfood, and while pursuing it with his spear he had fallen into the den,\r\nand by his cries raised the whole community of these social and harmless\r\nbeasts, which, powerful and numerous as they were, had attempted no\r\ninjury against the rude invader.\r\n\r\nThe wombat Jack had killed was about the size of a sheep; they divested\r\nit of its smooth thick fur skin, which was hung up to dry immediately.\r\nIn the morning they had an opportunity of examining the curious, clumsy\r\nanimals, which were still busily feeding. Wilkins declared their flesh\r\nto be delicate and excellent food; but, without water, no one felt any\r\nappetite for meat.\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"this creature is the _Phascolomys\r\nursinus_, partaking of the form of the bear and the hog; but, like the\r\ngreat majority of Australian animals, marsupial.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is an ugly fellow,\" said Hugh, \"with his huge body and short legs;\r\nbut his skin is capital; we will clean it to make a mattrass for papa,\r\nand we must have another skin for Margaret. After all, Jenny, a\r\nwombat-steak will be more juicy than this dreadful dry, husky biscuit;\r\nand I suppose we must try to eat, or we shall never have strength to get\r\nout of this desert.\"\r\n\r\nThe steaks were really excellent with sliced melon, if the travellers\r\ncould have relished food without water; and after breakfast they set\r\nout, again eagerly watching for signs of water; but no one feeling\r\nsufficient energy to execute another wombat before they departed. They\r\ncontinued to struggle on over a loose sandy soil, covered with a bush\r\nresembling the heath, so dear to the northern people of Great Britain;\r\nthe very sight of which cheered the thirsty wanderers in the dry desert;\r\nand they talked of the moors of home till their steps grew lighter. But\r\nthe toil of dragging the light sledge over or through the bushes became\r\nhard labor; and at length Mr. Mayburn, exhausted with thirst, was so\r\novercome that two of the young men had to support him, as they slowly\r\nmoved on to escape from this desert.\r\n\r\n\"Keep up your heart, master,\" said the attached Wilkins; \"and Jenny,\r\nwoman, be getting yer cans ready; we'se have a sup of rain afore long,\r\ndepend on't. Now some of ye light-heeled young uns, run on, and seek out\r\na shelter for t' master.\"\r\n\r\nThe sky was dark, the thunder rumbled at a distance, and the young\r\npeople looked round in happy anxiety for some shelter; but in vain,--not\r\neven a tree was to be seen; and at last they were obliged to content\r\nthemselves with a little cleared spot, backed by a low brush-covered\r\nhill, and surrounded by the tea-shrub mingled with the graceful heath.\r\nThere they hollowed out a sort of recess in the soft sandy hill-side,\r\nbefore which they hung the skin of the wombat, that Mr. Mayburn and\r\nMargaret, at least, might be sheltered. By this time the rain had begun\r\nto fall in torrents, and every vessel they had brought away was placed\r\nto catch the precious drops.\r\n\r\nThen the boys made _forms_ as they called them, beneath the brushwood,\r\ninto which they crept, to escape, as far as they could, the deluge of\r\nrain. But ever and anon a hand was stretched out to obtain a draught of\r\nthe long-pined-for water; and though they declared it tasted warm, they\r\nfelt so refreshed that there succeeded a great appetite for\r\nwombat-steak, which could not, however, be gratified; for to attempt to\r\nmake a fire was hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"What charming dormitories we have!\" said Gerald. \"The rain dripping\r\nthrough these narrow-leaved shrubs and dabbling your face all night\r\nlong, will be so comfortable. I don't think a wombat's den would be such\r\na bad thing to-night. Ruth, how do the cocks and hens like this\r\nweather?\"\r\n\r\n\"I keeps 'em covered an' under my cloak, Master Gerald,\" answered she;\r\n\"but, bonnie things, they tremmel and cower all of a heap. You see,\r\nbirds and such-like, are all for sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"And sunshine enough they've had here, Ruth,\" replied he; \"and now we\r\nmust not be unthankful for the rain we wanted much. Pleasant dreams to\r\nyou all, my friends!\" called out the lively boy, as he dived under the\r\nbushes, to scratch himself out a den, as he said. But the rain and the\r\nthunder prevented much sleep, and at the first gleam of light, the boys\r\nissued from their comfortless dens, with some dry twigs which had\r\nformed their beds, and with which they proposed, though the rain was\r\nstill falling, to make a fire to cook some meat. But before they could\r\naccomplish their plan, they were disturbed by a trampling among the\r\nbushes, and the sound of human voices.\r\n\r\n\"The savages! the savages!\" whispered Hugh; \"I think I can distinguish\r\nthe voice of Black Peter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scatter the twigs,\" said Arthur; \"put the water-vessels underneath the\r\nbushes. Draw these skins into your form, Margaret, and crouch out of\r\nsight. Now! now! to cover, all of you!\"\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely given the place the appearance of being unvisited, and\r\ndrawn themselves securely under the scrub, when the voices were so close\r\nto them that they could distinguish, though they could not understand\r\nthe words. Only Black Peter, who pronounced the language slowly, was\r\nsufficiently distinct for them to make out the words signifying\r\n\"mountains\" and \"plenty of water.\"\r\n\r\nThe party passed close to them, but without pausing, and when the steps\r\nand voices sounded sufficiently distant, Arthur looked out, and saw the\r\nsame men who had besieged them in their mountain retreat, still headed\r\nby Peter. All the men were outrageously painted white and red, though\r\nthey were partially covered with opossum cloaks to shelter them from the\r\nrain. Arthur observed that they moved on towards the east, where, at a\r\ngreat distance, appeared a dark line, which he concluded was the\r\nmountain-range Peter had alluded to.\r\n\r\nOne after another the alarmed family appeared from their hiding-places;\r\nBaldabella was eagerly questioned about their discourse, and she replied\r\nthat she had heard Peter say, \"White men go to mountain, find much\r\nwater. Peter go to mountain, find plenty water, plenty white fellow,\r\nplenty gun, knife. Kill white man, kill bad fellow Wilkins.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's reet! I'll uphold her,\" said Wilkins. \"Depend on 't Peter's\r\nheared of some bush-rangers out ower yonder, and he'll want to join 'em.\r\nWe'se have to keep clear of their track, master. Just look round ye,\r\nwhat chance should we have again a lot of them desp'rate rogues, wi'\r\nguns in their hands, and blood in their hearts; and when they're fairly\r\nset on, them blacks is as bad; they reckon nought of a dozen lives to\r\nget haud on a gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither shall we flee?\" cried Mr. Mayburn, in a distracted tone.\r\n\"Speak, Margaret--Arthur--and you, my good man, who, steeped in evil,\r\nhad yet strength given you to turn away from it, guide and save us!\r\nAlas! it is but too true; man, civilized or savage, preserves his innate\r\nand original depravity. 'There is none good; no, not one.' Men have\r\nspoken of the simple and pure life of the desert; we see what it is in\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear papa,\" said Margaret, \"we must bid adieu to the fallacious\r\ndreams of poetry, the romance of that golden age when men were virtuous\r\nbecause they were ignorant. These are men to whom the temptations of the\r\nworld are unknown; men who have never looked on the brilliant\r\ndecorations of vice; yet they are harsh, cruel, selfish, and faithless.\r\nIs this truly human nature, papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear, my child, it is too truly human nature,\" answered Mr.\r\nMayburn,--\"fallen, degraded, unredeemed human nature. Well does a great\r\nand wise writer on the natural depravity of man picture the ignorant\r\nsavage as 'a compound of pride and indolence, and selfishness, and\r\ncunning and cruelty; full of a revenge which nothing could satiate, of a\r\nferocity which nothing could soften; strangers to the most amiable\r\nsensibilities of nature.' Then what weight of sin must rest on the souls\r\nof those who, having been taught the way of truth themselves, take\r\nadvantage of the frailty of humanity to lead these heathens into the\r\ngulf of crime. Woe to those men 'who know the best, and yet the worst\r\npursue.'\"\r\n\r\nWhile they watched the gradual disappearance of their enemies, the rain\r\nceased, and Jenny summoned the party to the enjoyment of tea to their\r\ndry biscuit, before they resumed their journey, the prospect of which\r\nwas still unpromising.\r\n\r\n\"We must now, defying all the threatened deserts, go on towards the\r\nsouth,\" said Arthur, \"and evade, if we possibly can, our implacable and\r\ninveterate pursuers. The temptation to cross the eastern mountains is\r\ngreat, but I fear, Wilkins, we should hardly be safe, even in the rear\r\nof such dangerous company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay! Mr. Arthur, keep out of their way,\" said Wilkins. \"Ye heared\r\nwhat Baldabella said about their going to rondessvowse ower yonder wi'\r\nthem roguish bush-rangers; and I see no sense in running into t' thick\r\non 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, Wilkins,\" answered Arthur. \"Then we will decide on a\r\nroute due south. So, forward, my brave men, and let us carefully carry\r\naway the water we have preserved, for I fear much we have not yet passed\r\nthe wilderness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Dry Wilderness.--Despair.--The Coming-down of the Waters.--The\r\nDiscomfited Savages.--Hunger and Thirst.--The Footsteps in the Mud.--A\r\nPond.--The Talegalla and its Nest.--The Valley of Promise.--The River to\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was indeed on a wilderness they now entered, where low entangled\r\nbrushwood spread as far as the eye could extend, unvaried by the\r\nappearance of a single tree rising above it; and as they toiled through\r\nor over this perplexing ground, carrying the bark sledge, which it was\r\nimpossible to draw over the bush, they were often deceived by the sight\r\nof a line of tall reeds, the border of the bed of some river, now wholly\r\ndry, or merely muddy with the rain of the previous day. They saw no\r\nanimals, except two or three emus, which swiftly fled from pursuit; and\r\nthey were too eager to escape from the dry desert to waste time in the\r\nchase. For two days, successive morning suns showed them the same\r\ntrackless and unwatered heaths spread before them; then the water was\r\nexhausted, and they turned away with loathing from the dry bread and\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nSlowly and languidly they dragged on their weary way, still watching and\r\nhoping in vain. Another day of suffering dawned on them; and now the\r\nscorching air, the dry food, the fatigue, and the consuming thirst\r\novercame them one after another, and before evening Mr. Mayburn said,\r\n\"Let us lie down here, Arthur. God has chosen, in His wisdom, to put\r\nthis termination to our efforts. Nature is exhausted; let us lie down\r\nand prepare for death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, my dear father,\" answered Arthur. \"God wills that we should be\r\nactive, and strive to surmount difficulties, or He would not have\r\nbestowed on us the bounteous gifts of thought and action. Margaret, I\r\nknow your faith and resolution; encourage my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"You look to me in vain, my dear brother,\" said Margaret. \"I am unable\r\nto think or to move. Save our beloved father, and leave me beneath these\r\nbushes to die. I feel that death must be near at hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beseech you to rally your energy, my darling Meggie,\" said her\r\nbrother, in a broken voice. \"Surely, after the rain that fell yesterday,\r\nwe must soon find some pools. We must not be so weak as to remain here,\r\nwith our pursuers so near to us, and drought and death around us. Let us\r\ntry at least to cross this muddy and deceitful gorge, and be thankful;\r\nfor remember, my dear sister, if this had been now a foaming river, we\r\nshould have been unable to ford it, and must have been lost in this\r\ndesert.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret was too weak to reply, and Arthur, lifting her with difficulty\r\nin his enfeebled arms, descended the banks, and crossed the wide bed of\r\na river which was scarcely moist enough to leave the traces of his\r\nfootsteps. Wilkins and Jack supported Mr. Mayburn across, and the rest\r\nlanguidly followed. They crawled slowly up the rocky banks of the\r\nopposite side, which were covered with thick scrubby bushes; and then\r\nbeneath a spreading acacia, they sat down to rest a few moments, and\r\nendeavored to nerve themselves to endurance and exertion.\r\n\r\n\"Surely, Wilkins,\" said Arthur, \"that lofty line of mountains which we\r\ncan still see at the east, though so distant, ought to supply springs\r\nand streams to these plains, and there must be water at no great\r\ndistance. You and I are pretty stout; can we not leave these feeble\r\nfolks here, and go on to search for some relief for them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look yonder, Mr. Arthur,\" answered Wilkins, \"just atween us and them\r\nmountains, and say if we ought to leave 'em behind us.\"\r\n\r\nArthur beheld with dismay, at about a mile's distance, a dark mass\r\nmoving over the bare plain. He saw that the savages were returning, and\r\neven his firm heart failed, for here was no shelter--no hope of escape.\r\nHe remained struck dumb for a minute; then he whispered to his brothers\r\nthe dreadful fact, adding, \"They must be nearer than they appear to be,\r\nfor I surely hear them as well as see them. Certainly, some sound breaks\r\nthe stillness of this solitary desert. It must be the murmur of many\r\nvoices.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me like men felling wood,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"It is more like the blessed sound of water,\" said O'Brien, springing\r\nup.\r\n\r\nStill the mass of figures, though now more defined and plainly\r\nrecognized to be the savage host, approached slowly; and they could not\r\nproduce the strange rumor, which momentarily grew louder, crackling,\r\ntearing, roaring, like the mighty elephant, forcing its way through the\r\nthicket. All the party now heard in trembling fear this unaccountable\r\nphenomenon, and the weeping women knelt down to pray for aid amidst\r\naccumulated distresses.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" murmured the almost unconscious Margaret, \"I smell water. Oh,\r\ngive me some, or I die.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is water!\" shouted O'Brien \"I said it was water. It is the river\r\ncoming down. Come on, Hugh, let us meet it;\" and he leaped down into the\r\nbed of the stream.\r\n\r\n\"Stop the lad!\" cried Wilkins, following and dragging him up the bank\r\nagain. \"We'se ha'e water enough, and more nor we want soon. Look ye!\r\nlook ye!\" and they saw a slender thread of water come crawling over the\r\nbed like a silver snake.\r\n\r\n\"Sharp! sharp! hand us a bucket!\" called Wilkins; and, provided with a\r\nbucket, he descended and quickly procured a small quantity of water to\r\nrelieve the worst sufferers; but before a second supply could be\r\nobtained, he was compelled to retreat in haste, and an amazing spectacle\r\nburst on the eyes of the beholders. A mighty tower of water was seen to\r\napproach, rushing, pouring, foaming; casting up from it trunks of trees,\r\ndrenched garlands of creeping plants, and showers of pebbles. In an\r\nincredibly short space of time the resistless torrent had filled the\r\ndeep gorge, and was splashing over the rocky banks.\r\n\r\nGradually the torrent subsided into a smooth, deep, and flowing river,\r\nfrom which the pining sufferers obtained the refreshment they had so\r\nlong sought, and then, with bended knees, offered up a thanksgiving to\r\nthat Great Power who had by this providential event rescued them from a\r\npainful death, and interposed an insurmountable barrier between them and\r\ntheir vindictive enemies, who, having now approached near enough to be\r\naware of this unexpected obstacle, saw, with evident wrath, their prize\r\nsnatched from their grasp. At the command of their implacable and\r\nwell-known chief, Peter, some of the most skilful threw their spears;\r\nbut the river was not less than fifty yards across, besides which, the\r\nstrong east wind drifted away the weapons from their intended aim; and\r\nthe invigorated and uninjured family lost no time in leaving the\r\ndangerous spot, and were soon beyond sight of the stubborn natives, and\r\nthe malicious bush-ranger.\r\n\r\n\"It is plain they have no means of crossing the river,\" said Arthur;\r\n\"but, Wilkins, what can have induced them to return from the mountains?\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon they'll have somehow missed their comrades as was to be,\"\r\nanswered Wilkins. \"Maybe they'd an inkling as how we were behind 'em and\r\nnot afore 'em; and they'd niver reckon on t' water coming down; and not\r\na soul among 'em can swim, barring Peter, and he knew better nor trust\r\nhisself among us alone. We've stopped 'em a bit now, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not we, Wilkins, but God,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"It was 'the Lord that\r\nbrought again the waters upon them,' and saved us. To His name be the\r\nglory.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have still before us a long struggle through these sterile wilds,\"\r\nsaid Arthur; \"but this deliverance must give us renewed courage for\r\nlabor and privation. Now we may afford to eat our supper, and take our\r\nrest without fear.\"\r\n\r\nThe strongest of the party, before they left the river, had filled all\r\nthe vessels with water, and brought them off, and very soon, almost\r\nwithin hearing of the noisy savages, they made a fire, and enjoyed again\r\nthe luxury of tea to their potatoes, before weary nature sought repose.\r\nBut as soon as it was light, they set out, after again having tea to fit\r\nthem for another day of toil. The march was resumed with renewed health\r\nand spirits, but still the monotony of the matted rough desert, which\r\nrarely afforded a clear spot for them to draw the sledge, fatigued and\r\ndepressed them before the day was over. And when they rested for the\r\nevening, and Jenny produced the scanty remainder of potatoes, and the\r\nstill smaller portion of grain, dismay sat on every countenance, and\r\nJack was the first to demand that Ruth's basket might be lightened, and\r\nthe contents given up to satisfy the hungry and healthy appetite of the\r\npublic in general.\r\n\r\nIt was found on inspection that besides three full-grown fowls, the girl\r\nwas still carrying six good-sized chickens, the rest of the brood having\r\nperished, from accident or scanty food. Immediately, as a matter of\r\nexpediency to save the oats, to lessen the burden they had to carry, and\r\nto feed the hungry, sentence was passed that two chickens should be\r\nexecuted each day, and it was hoped, before all were eaten, some region\r\nof more plenty might be attained.\r\n\r\nWith great reluctance, and floods of tears, Ruth relinquished her pets,\r\nand at the end of the three days, only the old fowls were left, and\r\nevery potato, grain, and drop of water was gone. Then, indeed, they\r\nrealized the misery of famine; strength and cheerfulness left them, and\r\nthey tottered reluctantly forward, slowly and in mournful silence.\r\n\r\nSometimes an emu was seen at a distance, but none had energy or strength\r\nto chase it, and Arthur, whose mental vigor supported him, when all were\r\nsinking round him, tried in vain to rouse them from their apathy.\r\n\r\n\"Let us struggle on a little longer,\" he said. \"Once more I see a tall\r\nline of reeds, and by God's mercy, we may not be disappointed this time.\r\nCome, Jack, you and I will make a forced march in search of succor for\r\nthose who are weaker than ourselves; and if we succeed we will return to\r\nrefresh and bring them forward.\"\r\n\r\nWith buckets slung over their shoulders, and leaning on their long\r\nspears, the two young men strained every nerve to reach the reeds like\r\nthose which had so frequently disappointed them, and, cutting or forcing\r\ntheir way through the tall canes, they came again on the bed of a\r\nriver--moist and muddy, indeed, but not a pool of water was to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Let us ascend higher; we may find a little,\" said Arthur. \"But, surely,\r\nJack, here are footsteps on the soft earth. Some one has been here\r\nbefore us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough there has,\" replied Jack. \"Men have been here; booted\r\nchaps, too; none of the savages; anyhow, not them that we reckon\r\nsavages, but like enough, they'll be little better. Ay, their track runs\r\nupward; what say ye, Mr. Arthur, are we to follow it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must follow it, Jack,\" answered Arthur; \"we must find water, or\r\ndeath is inevitable to us; and we are better in the rear of suspected\r\nfoes than before them. And yonder are pools before us, God be thanked.\r\nLet us drink and then we will carry life back to those who are in\r\ngreater need than ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe pools afforded ample supplies. The young men drank, and bathed their\r\nburning faces and heads, and then hastened back, refreshed and vigorous,\r\nbearing full buckets for the anxious party who awaited their return, and\r\nafter they had drunk, and were able to converse, they were informed of\r\nthe appearance of the footsteps.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see 'em wi' my own eyes,\" said Wilkins. \"If it be ony of\r\nour chaps from t' colony, run-a-way fellows, I ken t' make of their\r\nboots at t' first sight. But it's a long step for 'em to have marched,\r\npoor rogues. What think ye if we stirred from here? for I'd like to tell\r\nye what I ken about them tracks.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole party went forward more briskly than before, and reached the\r\nbed of the river, where Wilkins carefully examined the marks, and then\r\nsaid,--\"Bush-rangers, as sure as ye stand there, Mr. Arthur. Here's been\r\nfour on 'em; and look ye here, what call ye them tracks? I say, beasts\r\nand horses. I ken their game: they'll have druv' off a lot of stock, and\r\nthey'll reckon to squat here somewhere north. But they'll find they'll\r\nhave to seek out a cannier bit nor this. Like enough, master, it'll be\r\nthem chaps as Black Peter was lighting on finding.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the two younger boys had ascended considerably higher up\r\nthe bed of the river, and reached a large pond covered with water-fowl.\r\nThey were fortunate enough to shoot four ducks, and came back laden with\r\nthis grateful relief to their utter destitution. They dined as soon as\r\nthe birds could be cooked; and this rest, and abundant food, invigorated\r\nand cheered them to set out once more.\r\n\r\nThey would gladly have continued to travel along the bed of the river,\r\nwhere they might certainly have depended on a constant supply of water,\r\nas well as wild ducks; but, on consideration, it was decided that to\r\nfollow the steps of lawless robbers was a dangerous experiment, and that\r\nit was advisable still to continue the southern course over the dreary\r\ndesert. Their progress was, however, rendered more tolerable, by the\r\nknowledge that they carried with them water for two days, at least; and\r\nthey began to perceive there was beauty, even in that wide, solitary\r\nwilderness, though it appeared unknown to all the living world.\r\n\r\nYet it was not altogether without living inhabitants; for, the second\r\nday, Gerald surprised them by crying out, \"A turkey! a turkey!\" and\r\nspears, arrows, and boomerang, were speedily sent after the luckless\r\nbird, though the sight and the cries of the strange multitude had caused\r\nit to spring from the bush where it was feeding, to the lowest branches\r\nof a tree somewhat taller than the unvaried dwarf bushes; and from\r\nthence, rather by leaps than by flight, it ascended to the high\r\nbranches, where it only exposed itself more to the weapons of the\r\ninveterate sportsmen, and was speedily brought down.\r\n\r\nIt was beyond the usual size of the English turkey, to which it bore a\r\nstrong resemblance, and delighted Ruth with the idea that they were\r\ncoming among poultry again. The young naturalists had more opportunity\r\nof observing this specimen than the last they had killed, and they\r\nagreed that this curious bird belonged to a family peculiar to this\r\nstrange country, the _Megapodidæ_, but so nearly allied to the family of\r\n_Meleagrinæ_, that it might familiarly be called the Australian turkey.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that it is, as I formerly believed,\" said Mr.\r\nMayburn, \"the _Talegalla_ of the prince of ornithologists, Gould. The\r\nmassy claw is a striking characteristic, so conformable to the habits\r\nand haunts of the bird, enabling it to run amongst the bush, or climb\r\ntrees to escape its enemies, the chief of which is the _Dingo_, or\r\nnative dog, which has been rather troublesome to us from its nocturnal\r\nyelping than from its appearance. Now, concluding this to be the\r\n_Talegalla_, we must endeavor to discover the remarkable nest of this\r\nbird, which, like the ostrich, leaves its eggs to be hatched by the sun.\r\nThese eggs we are told are delicious; but above all, the sight of the\r\npeculiar nest would gratify my curiosity.\"\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded far, when they saw, a little out of their course,\r\na curious mound or pyramid, which they all went up to examine. It might\r\nhave been the work of man's hand, so regularly and artfully the ground,\r\nfor a considerable space round it, was entirely cleared of vegetation,\r\nand the decayed grass and brushwood thus removed formed the remarkable\r\nmound. The lower part seemed to have been erected some years, the decay\r\nbeing complete; the upper part was fresher, as if recently renewed.\r\n\r\n\"It is apparent that this pile must be the work of years,\" said Mr.\r\nMayburn, \"and is probably accomplished by numbers laboring in common to\r\nraise this vast hatching oven. I am reluctant to disturb a work which\r\nhas cost so much labor; but I think we might partially uncover it, to\r\nobserve the internal arrangement.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys mounted the pile, which was six feet in height, and carefully\r\nunpacked the upper layer of the hot-bed, when they soon discovered a\r\nvast number of large white oval eggs, nearly four inches in length,\r\nwhich were buried standing on end, with the broad end uppermost, about\r\nten inches apart from each other. One of the eggs was partially hatched;\r\nand the young bird might be seen, covered, not with down, but with\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the feathered bird in the shell Ruth turned away with\r\ndisgust from the long-desired poultry. \"Nay, Master Gerald,\" said she,\r\nas the boy held out the egg to her; \"ye'll not catch me touching an egg\r\nlike that, niver sitten on as it ought to be, and t' bird chipping\r\nready-feathered. It's unnat'ral, and they're uncanny creaters, they\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, one of these unbroken eggs would make a custard, Ruth, as good as\r\nthat of an English Turkey,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I'se niver credit, sir,\" answered she. \"Not a custard fit\r\nfor Christians. Them black folks 'll eat aught 'at falls in their way.\r\nOh! Miss Marget, this is a queer, awesome country!\"\r\n\r\nThey did not take any of the eggs, which appeared to be in an advanced\r\nstate for hatching; but they roasted the talegalla, and found it\r\ndelicious meat, though it must be remembered appetite was keen and\r\nturkey a rarity.\r\n\r\n\"Now, to-morrow morning,\" said Arthur, \"we must make for yon distant\r\ngreen hills; and I trust we shall find a pleasanter region. If we could\r\nbut meet with one of the rivers that flow towards the south, we might\r\ntry boating again, and make our journey on an easier plan. Surely we\r\nought to have reached the division between the northern and southern\r\nwaters.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a rare hit to light on a good river,\" said Wilkins, \"for\r\nwe're gettin fearfully into t' midst of a nest of bush-rangers, and\r\nwe'll ha'e little chance of slipping 'em, trailing on in this way.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning view of the green hills was so flattering that they indulged\r\nin the luxury of tea for breakfast, though the water was nearly\r\nexpended, and then proceeded hopefully over the scrub, now diversified\r\nwith various species of acacia, a Stenochylus bending under its large\r\nscarlet blossoms, and a Boronia laden with lilac flowers. Cheerfully\r\nhailing the fertile regions once more, they soon reached the steep\r\nwooded ascent of the hills, where the lively notes of the birds again\r\ngave life to the solitude; while their brilliant plumage lighted up the\r\ngray foliage of the acacia and the dark gloom of the evergreens.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's laborious ascent they reached the table-land, where the\r\nfresh breeze and the balmy fragrance announced a pleasanter region. They\r\nrested, and looked round with admiration and delight on the glorious\r\nprospect below them. On the east and on the west distant ranges of\r\nmountains were visible, between which lay a rich valley studded with\r\nlofty forest trees, while here and there arose green hills crowned with\r\nrocky masses resembling towers and fortresses, or ruined castles, in\r\npicturesque beauty.\r\n\r\nFrom the western range of mountains might be seen a long, dark-green\r\nline, stretching to the south-east, which they decided must be the\r\nboundary of some large river. This line they impatiently desired to\r\nreach; and, after a short rest, they continued their march over a plain\r\nrich with rare shrubs and many new and curious grasses now in seed,\r\namongst which they hailed with pleasure their old friend the oat-grass,\r\nwith which they filled the emptied bags as they passed through it. A\r\ndark and luxuriant wood formed the green line they had seen from the\r\nheights, and crossing it, they stood on the rocky banks of a rapid river\r\nwhich flowed to the south-east.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments they stood silently contemplating this pleasant sight,\r\nbeneath a graceful _Acacia Pendula_. Then Mr. Mayburn turned to his\r\nfamily, with tears in his eyes, and said, \"My children, let us give\r\nthanks where thanks are due. We are again rescued from famine,\r\ncaptivity, or death. Let us praise His name who has brought us from the\r\ndark valley of the shadow of death, to life and hope.\"\r\n\r\nAll kneeled down, and the little Nakinna was the first to raise her\r\ninfantine voice, saying \"Our Father;\" and to that simple and sublime\r\nexpression of heavenly trust, Mr. Mayburn added the prayers of humility,\r\nhope, and gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"To-night we must rest,\" said Arthur, when the prayers were concluded;\r\n\"but to-morrow we must, if possible, make two canoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will bark the trees to-night, Mr. Arthur, if you please,\" said Jack.\r\n\"The bark will dry, and I'd like all ready to start. To-morrow's never\r\nso safe as to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack's right,\" said Wilkins. \"I were feeling a bit idle mysel', but\r\nthere's no sense in't; so lend us hand on an axe, and I'se be none the\r\nworse for a stroke of work.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the young men were engaged in cutting away the bark for the shells\r\nof the canoes, and the fibres of the stringy bark for tying them, and\r\ncollecting the strong gum for cement, Baldabella descended to the river,\r\nand soon speared two immense fish, which seemed to be a species of\r\nmullet; and she also brought in a quantity of the fresh-water mussels,\r\nthe shells of which were so useful for domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nThe broiled fish and hastily prepared oat-cake--or damper, as Wilkins\r\ncalled it--formed an excellent supper; and though the nights had now\r\nbecome cold, even in that tropical region, they slept on beds of heath,\r\ncovered with opossum cloaks, without injury or disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nBoat-building again.--Unlucky Ruth.--The Woods on Fire.--Dangers on Land\r\nand Water.--The Wounded Girl.--A Home among the Mountains.--The\r\nBottle-tree.--The Bee-hunt.--Bean-coffee.--The Lost Hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the first merry cry of the laughing jackass, which announced the dawn\r\nas regularly as the English cock-crow, the workmen rose to labor at\r\ntheir hopeful undertaking; and before many hours were passed the canoes\r\nwere nearly finished, and the women were busy cutting down grass for\r\nseats; when Ruth, who had left them, came rushing back through the wood,\r\nwith her wildest look of distraction, crying out, \"They seed me! Miss\r\nMarget, they seed me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou unlucky lass!\" exclaimed Jenny. \"Where hast thou been? and who's\r\nseen thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Them black men, they seed me!\" answered she. \"I were cutting some oats\r\nfor my hens; and I heared 'em shouting out their _coo-ee_, and when I\r\nlooked round I seed a lot of 'em, a long way off, and I skriked out; I\r\ncouldn't help it, Miss Marget, and then they _coo-eed_ again, and off I\r\nran. But I'se feared they heared me skrike, onyhow.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret, in deep dismay, communicated this unfortunate event to her\r\nbrothers, and Arthur went through the wood to reconnoitre. From a hidden\r\nretreat he observed a troop of men, still at a great distance, who\r\nappeared to be stooping down to mark some track on the ground, from\r\nwhich he judged Ruth's cries had been unnoticed. He returned in haste\r\nto report his observations.\r\n\r\n\"They've tracked us, sure enough,\" said Wilkins. \"Sharp's the word,\r\nlads, we may distance 'em yet, if we work hard. We'se run down t' water\r\nat a bonnie rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will watch and report their approach, while you all work at the\r\nboats,\" said Margaret. \"Where shall I stand, Wilkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just here, Miss,\" answered he, \"aback of this thick bush. There's yer\r\npeep-hole; and shout when they get close up.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret's first shout was a terrific one. \"Arthur! Wilkins!\" she cried\r\nin a frantic voice. \"Oh! God help us! whither shall we flee? The\r\nwretches are firing the wood.\"\r\n\r\nThe savages, taking advantage of a north wind, had fired the long dry\r\ngrass--a common practice with the natives. It was already fiercely\r\nblazing, and rushing towards the wood with resistless fury. The ground\r\non which the travellers had encamped, and the spot where the young men\r\nwere working, they had fortunately cleared for beds, and for seats in\r\nthe boats; and now, while Jack and Arthur finished the canoes, the rest\r\ncut down the brushwood round, and flung it into the river, leaving a\r\nspace of twenty or thirty yards wide quite cleared. But beyond that rose\r\nthe lofty trees, that, once blazing, must shower down destruction on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAlready the crackling of the trees announced that the conflagration was\r\nbegun in the woods, and that no time must be lost, if they hoped to\r\nescape from it. Flights of white cockatoos, of bright-colored parrots,\r\nand glittering bronze pigeons, rose screaming from their desolated\r\nhomes, and affrighted opossums sprang from their nests, swung on the\r\ntrees, or fell senseless with the smoke on the ground. But in this time\r\none canoe was completed and launched, with the women, all the baggage,\r\nand Mr. Mayburn and Hugh to direct it. They had been swept down the\r\nriver to a considerable distance from the fire before the second canoe,\r\nimperfectly completed, whirled off with the rest of the family, who\r\nreached their friends at a point of safety, with wild looks and scorched\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nThen they all rested a moment, to look back on the terrific and still\r\nspreading conflagration, by the red light of which they saw the\r\nfrightful outline of the dark forms, among whom, though now naked, and\r\nscarcely less dark than the rest, they distinguished the muscular and\r\nungraceful form of Peter, which strangely contrasted with the stately,\r\nslender, and agile forms of the natives.\r\n\r\n\"He's not lit on them t' other rangers yet,\" said Wilkins. \"That's a\r\ngood job, onyhow; for, ye see, they'd horses, and we'd fairly been\r\nhunted down like foxes.\"\r\n\r\nAugmented by the recent rains, the river flowed in an uninterrupted\r\ncourse, and before the evening and the calls of hunger induced them to\r\narrest their flight, the grateful family believed they must have\r\nprogressed twenty-five or thirty miles to the south-east, with very\r\nslight exertion, through new and lovely scenes of hill, vale, rocky\r\nmountains, and rich forests.\r\n\r\nThen, on the margin of the river, beneath the shelter of a thick wood,\r\nthey landed, to thank God for their escape, and to take rest. Mussels, a\r\nsort of cray-fish, and the river-cod, formed their supper, which was\r\ncooked in fear and trembling, lest the smoke of their fire should bring\r\non them the savages, or the flames should spread to the brushwood, a\r\ncatastrophe they now regarded with horror.\r\n\r\nBefore they set out the following morning, the canoes were completely\r\nfinished, and oars and paddles added: thus their progress was safe and\r\neasy, and for three days no accident arrested their course; but on the\r\nfourth day they were compelled to land, to repair a rent in one of the\r\ncanoes, and were startled at their labor by the sound of the \"_coo-ee_\"\r\nand an alarming rustling among the trees. Without delay the canoes were\r\ncarried to the water, and all embarked; nor had they proceeded twenty\r\nyards before a large opening appeared in the wooded bank, which had\r\nevidently been cleared by fire. Here they beheld the first permanent\r\nsettlement of the natives they had yet met with. Many large huts stood\r\nround, formed of boughs, and thatched with bark. Several fires were\r\nburning, around which the women and children were gathered, and a number\r\nof men, armed with spears and clubs, advanced to the bank with\r\nthreatening aspect, when they saw the canoes.\r\n\r\nLoud and angry words were heard, which Baldabella interpreted to\r\nbe,--\"What for white men come here? Go away! go away!\" And the way in\r\nwhich they waved their clubs and stone tomahawks was very intimidating.\r\n\r\n\"Best take no notish of their antics, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins; and,\r\nall agreeing in the wisdom of the counsel, they rowed forward, the men\r\nstill uttering defiance against the strange invaders, and apparently\r\namazed that their threats were received with indifference. But Ruth,\r\nwhom Jenny had been ineffectually endeavoring to calm, at last could no\r\nlonger control her terror, and poured forth such a succession of\r\nshrieks, that the savages seemed encouraged, and immediately directed a\r\nvolley of spears against the canoes.\r\n\r\nThe swift motion happily discomfited their attempt, and but one spear\r\ntook effect, seriously wounding the right arm of Ruth, which she had\r\nheld up to shield her face.\r\n\r\nA few moments carried the boats beyond the reach of the weapons, and\r\nthey continued their voyage, till they believed themselves safe from the\r\npursuit of the assailants. Mr. Mayburn and Margaret bound up the wound\r\nof Ruth, which bled profusely, and was very painful, and she could not\r\nbe persuaded that she should ever recover. She declared that she was\r\nkilled, and she earnestly begged that she might be buried in a\r\nchurch-yard, till Jenny, out of patience with her cowardice, said,--\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, ye silly wench; where think ye we're to find a church-yard\r\namong these heathens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they'll eat me, Jenny!\" she cried, in great horror.\r\n\r\n\"Be comforted, Ruth,\" said Margaret; \"you are under the protection of a\r\nmerciful God; and as long as we are spared, we will take care of you,\r\nand even bury you if it be His will that you die before us. But, believe\r\nme, Ruth, though your wound must be painful, there is no danger for your\r\nlife, unless you cry and fret yourself into a fever; so pray be\r\npatient.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, Miss Marget,\" sobbed she. \"Indeed I will, if you will feed my\r\nhens, and gather corn, whiles, for 'em. Shame on them black savages as\r\nburned down all that good corn.\"\r\n\r\nThe fretfulness and timidity of Ruth, however, inflamed the wound\r\ngreatly; and before the next day ended, they thought it prudent to\r\ndisembark at some quiet spot, where she could have shelter and rest. The\r\nbanks of the river had now become rocky, gradually sloping upwards to\r\nrugged and irregular mountains, amongst which they trusted to find the\r\nshelter they desired. A sloping bank offered them a landing-place, and\r\nthey disembarked, and the men bearing the light canoes on their\r\nshoulders, they left the river. Jack carried Ruth, now quite unfit for\r\nexertion, in his arms, and they were soon plunged into a maze of\r\nmountains, cut apart by narrow ravines, some of which were choked with\r\nfallen stones, and through others clear streams of water poured between\r\nrocks covered with new and graceful ferns, some of which were of\r\ngigantic size.\r\n\r\nThe further they penetrated into this maze, the more they became\r\nperplexed and embarrassed. At length, O'Brien, who had forced his way\r\nthrough a narrow, stone-encumbered crevice, called on them to join him\r\nin a lovely little valley, of three or four hundred yards across,\r\nencompassed with precipitous, overhanging rocks, and inaccessible,\r\nexcept by the narrow opening through which they had entered. It was\r\novergrown with tall grass, amongst which they saw the useful wild oats;\r\nin one corner was a deep clear pool of water, while the surrounding\r\nrocks were covered with brushwood, from which were heard the pleasing\r\nnotes of the beautiful pigeon, which the naturalists judged to be\r\n_Geophaps Scripta_, and which all agreed was the most delicious bird\r\never placed before gormandizing man.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous caves in these rocks, and they had only to choose\r\none dry and light for the sick woman, and then, enjoying the luxury of\r\nmany apartments, the young men selected their own bed-chambers, the\r\nboats were safely stowed into one hollow, and the ammunition placed\r\ncarefully in another rocky cave; and once more the family rejoiced in a\r\ntemporary resting-place.\r\n\r\nOne of the caves was chosen for a kitchen, and again the active young\r\nmen dug, and lined with stones, an oven, in which Jenny baked cakes of\r\nthe fresh-gathered oats, a dozen pigeons were despatched, tea was made\r\nfor the invalid, and all was festivity and peace. Still, Ruth's wound,\r\nwhich was torn by a jagged spear, showed no appearance of healing, and\r\nit was resolved to spend some days in this beautiful and untrodden\r\nsolitude, to allow the poor girl to recover, and to recruit the strength\r\nof all. But it was not possible to confine the active boys to the narrow\r\nvalley, and they daily found a pretext for some expedition. One day they\r\nset out to search for the _Tea shrub_, and brought home a large quantity\r\nof leaves. Another day they scaled some of the lower rocks, to obtain\r\ngum from the numerous trees from which it exuded, and brought out all\r\nthe family to see a curious tree, the trunk of which, formed like a\r\nbarrel, was in the thickest part not less than thirty feet in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\n\"It is one of the _Sterculiads_,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"and is, I conclude,\r\nthat wonder of Australia popularly known as the Bottle Tree, or, more\r\nscientifically, this peculiar species is named _Delabechea Rupestris_.\r\nIt appears to be full of gum, and is, doubtless, a great blessing to the\r\nnatives.\"\r\n\r\nBaldabella seemed rejoiced to see the tree, which she declared was\r\n\"good, very good,\" chewing the branches with great enjoyment; and they\r\nfound there was so much mucilage in the wood, that they cut some\r\nshavings, and poured boiling water over them, when a clear, sweet jelly\r\nwas formed, most agreeable to the palate, and highly relished by the\r\nwhole party.\r\n\r\nThe next expedition was suggested by Baldabella, who pointed to some\r\nbees humming among the trees, and said, \"Make very good dinner--very\r\ngood supper; Baldabella find his nest.\" Margaret taught the woman the\r\nname, honey, which she concluded was the good dinner she alluded to.\r\nThen the woman caught a bee, appearing to have no fear in handling it,\r\nand catching a piece of white down which had fallen from the breast of\r\nsome bird, and was floating on the air, she touched it with gum, and\r\nstuck it upon the captive bee; she now called on the rest to follow her,\r\nand leaving the valley, she stood on an elevated rock, released the bee,\r\nand kept her keen eye fixed on the white down as it sailed away,\r\nfollowing the flight of the insect, till she saw it settle in a tree.\r\nThen she stopped, and pointing to the trunk, ordered Jack to cut it. His\r\naxe was soon at work; the bark was stripped, and the hollow laid open:\r\nthey found the tree quite filled with honey, and cutting away a\r\nconsiderable quantity, they carried it off on pieces of bark. The bees,\r\nwhich were very small, either careless in the midst of plenty, or\r\npowerless to injure, did not molest the robbers. The honey was much\r\nmingled with wax, and looked and tasted like gingerbread; but, kneaded\r\nwith the bitter oat-paste, it rendered the biscuits pleasanter and more\r\npalatable.\r\n\r\n\"We really seem to have all we want here, Miss Marget,\" said Jenny one\r\nday. \"Isn't it a pity to hurry t' poor master over these weary commons\r\nand fells? We'se be sure to have winter at some end; and hadn't we\r\nbetter bide here a bit till it's past?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is really near the beginning of winter now, nurse,\" said Margaret;\r\n\"it is more than a year since we left England; for it is now the end of\r\nApril. I felt the air a little cold during last night, though now it is\r\nmild and balmy; and the evergreen shrubs, continual successions of\r\nflowers, noisy birds, and humming insects, make it more like an English\r\nsummer than the end of autumn. This is truly a charming climate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very nice, Miss Marget,\" answered Jenny; \"but don't you think we\r\nshould be better of a change of meat? One tires of pigeons always.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very right, Jenny,\" said O'Brien; \"though the observation is not new.\r\nI'll tell you what we will do: we will stalk a kangaroo for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No easy task, I should think, Gerald,\" said Arthur, \"if the kangaroo be\r\nas difficult to tire out as Wilkins tells us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll lead ye a bonnie chase,\" said Wilkins, \"that will he. Ye'll tire\r\nafore him. Ye'd better wait till Baldabella makes an end of that net\r\nshe's shaping to catch 'em. She's a long time about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we may wait another week,\" said Gerald, \"to obtain the ignoble\r\nmeans of snaring the poor fellow. No; I say, let us have a regular\r\nstalking-day. Arthur, what do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot have Arthur leave us for a day,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"I should\r\nnot feel it safe for Margaret. I can rely on his judgment and\r\ndiscretion.\"\r\n\r\nA few days after this Jack was engaged in putting the canoes in repair,\r\nand Wilkins had gone off to the river with Baldabella, to spear fish,\r\nwhen the two boys entreated that they might be allowed to take spears\r\nand bows--guns being prohibited, unless Arthur was of the party,--and\r\nset out after a kangaroo; for the woods and grassy hollows among the\r\nmountains abounded in game.\r\n\r\nOn the promise to Mr. Mayburn that they would not ramble far from home,\r\nthey were allowed to go; while Margaret was employed in teaching little\r\nNakinna to read, by tracing letters and words on the sand, and Mr.\r\nMayburn and Arthur were searching the crevices of the rocks for the rare\r\nbirds and the brilliant plants which, even at that late season, were to\r\nbe found in profusion.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the day Baldabella and Wilkins returned with baskets\r\nfilled with large fish, and a bag of pods filled with small beans, which\r\nthey had plucked in a sandy nook near the river. Each pod contained ten\r\nor twelve beans; and Baldabella's exclamations of delight showed they\r\nwere considered a prize.\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" said Arthur, \"that these beans are too dry at this season to\r\nbe useful as good vegetables, but I fancy we might roast them, and use\r\nthem as a substitute for coffee, to surprise our sportsmen when they\r\nreturn from their expedition.\"\r\n\r\nWith great satisfaction, Jenny heated the oven and roasted the beans,\r\nwhich were not larger than those of coffee, till they became the proper\r\ndeep-brown color. They were then bruised between two stones, and boiled\r\nwith a little honey, and the brown liquid wanted but milk to represent\r\nindifferent coffee. The partakers of the beverage declared it to be\r\nperfect; and Wilkins was sent back to the river to procure an abundant\r\nsupply, to be roasted for future occasions.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening drew near, and the family, leaving their several\r\noccupations, assembled together as usual, great anxiety filled every\r\nbreast, for the two hunters had not returned. They had taken no\r\nprovision with them; but this was a minor consideration, for no one\r\ncould starve in this region of plenty. Nor could the chase itself lead\r\nthem into danger; but there remained the ever-existing terror of the\r\ntreacherous and cunning natives, or still worse, of an encounter with\r\nthe lawless bush-rangers. The fears of Mr. Mayburn soon amounted to deep\r\ndistress, and at length Arthur and Wilkins set out to a high point of\r\nthe mountains, where they could command an extensive view, hoping to see\r\nthe wanderers. But before they reached the pinnacle, sudden darkness\r\nveiled the prospect, and Arthur reluctantly adopted the only means he\r\ncould then use to recall the boys. He fired his rifle, and the echoes,\r\nflung from mountain to mountain, thundered like a charge of artillery;\r\nand it seemed impossible that this report should not reach the ears of\r\nthe thoughtless ramblers.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a few minutes, in the vain hope of hearing some answering\r\nshout, Arthur and Wilkins retraced their steps to the caves, depressed\r\nwith the ill-success of their mission. Yet such was the deep distress of\r\nthe father, that his children endeavored to conceal their own sorrow,\r\nthat they might console him. He mourned as lost, not only his own brave\r\nboy, but the not less dear son of his lamented friend; and long refused\r\nto be comforted. Arthur represented to him that no more could be\r\neffected till morning; but that the youths, when they had gone astray\r\nwould have probably taken refuge in one of the numerous caves in the\r\nmountains, where they would be safe during the night; and he promised\r\nthat at the first gleam of light, he, Wilkins, and Jack, would set out\r\nin different directions to search for them.\r\n\r\n\"And remember, dear papa,\" said Margaret, \"this is, happily, not a\r\ncountry of fierce beasts; they may enter a cave boldly, secure that they\r\nshall not disturb a lion or a bear in his den. Nor need they fear the\r\nsnowstorm or the hurricane. This is a pleasant land! God seems to have\r\ncreated it for the abode of peace. Is it not, then, fearful wickedness\r\nthat civilized man, the professed Christian should scatter the seeds of\r\nevil rather than the seeds of truth among the simple inhabitants?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is, truly, a calm and blessed region,\" answered Mr. Mayburn. \"We\r\nseem to have been Heaven-directed towards it; and if my two dear boys\r\nwere again safely at my side, I confess that I should feel reluctant to\r\nleave it. In this vast and lovely solitude, where man has never before\r\nplanted his destroying foot, where neither storms nor wild beasts\r\nappall, and where God himself provides our food, even as He fed the\r\nProphet in the wilderness, we seem to be brought face to face with Him.\r\nHere we see and hear Him alone in His glorious works so richly scattered\r\naround us. Such may have been Eden, before the sin of man polluted it.\r\nIn this sublime solitude, consecrated to devotion and peace, would I\r\nwillingly remain conversing with my God. Here would I,--\r\n\r\n                    'Sustain'd and soothed\r\n    By an unfaltering trust, approach my grave,\r\n    Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch\r\n    About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a charming vision,\" said Margaret. \"But look round you, papa; the\r\nfresh, the restless, the aspiring spirit of youth must be exercised and\r\ndisciplined by the duties and trials of life. We may not dare to rest,\r\ndear father, till we have done our work.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are always rational, Margaret, and I am but a selfish visionary,\"\r\nanswered Mr. Mayburn. \"Even now my idle dreams have turned away my\r\nthoughts from my heavy and real calamity--the loss of my children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Depend on't we'se find t' lads all right, master,\" said Wilkins; \"and\r\nthey'll tell us what a good laugh they had when they heared that grand\r\nsalute we gave 'em amang these rattling hills.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Search for the Lost.--The Fig-tree.--Signals.--The Wanderers\r\nfound.--The Wounded Boy.--The Sufferings of the Thirsty.--The Rescue and\r\nReturn.--The Kangaroo Conflict.--A strange Meeting.--The\r\nBush-rangers.--The miraculous Escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nSleep fled from all the sorrowful family, and they gladly saw the\r\nmorning light which would enable them to set out to track the unlucky\r\nboys. The three men chose the high pinnacle from whence Arthur had fired\r\nthe preceding evening for a rendezvous, and fixed a white cross of\r\npeeled rods against the dark foliage of a gum-tree, that stood tall and\r\nconspicuous on the summit, as a land-mark. From thence Arthur proceeded\r\ndirectly north amidst the intricacies of the mountains, while Jack went\r\noff at the right-hand, and Wilkins at the left. It was agreed that they\r\nshould meet at the same spot in the evening, if the search was not\r\nsuccessful before then. Arthur carried one of the guns; the other being\r\nleft with Mr. Mayburn, that he might fire it as a signal, in case of\r\nalarm; while Arthur proposed, if he succeeded in discovering the\r\nfugitives, to recall the other two men by firing his gun.\r\n\r\nArthur's share of the work was certainly the most toilsome. At one\r\nmoment he was climbing over some lofty rock; the next, he was searching\r\nfor a pass amidst inaccessible heights; then winding through tortuous\r\ngorges, till his head became so bewildered that it was only when he\r\nobserved the course of the sun, or caught sight of the happy signal of\r\nthe white cross, that he was able to determine his position. Several\r\ntimes, from some elevation, he shouted loudly the names of the absent\r\nboys, but none answered. The day wore away, and he gladly rested for a\r\nshort time beneath a fig-tree, still bearing a quantity of ripe fruit,\r\nwhile the ground was strewn with the decayed figs, on which flocks of\r\nbronze pigeons, yellow cockatoos, and rose-colored parrots, were busily\r\nfeeding. These birds seemed to confide in Arthur's forbearance, for they\r\ncontinued to enjoy their feast without evincing any alarm, except by a\r\nvehement greeting, in their several notes, as if they inquired his\r\nbusiness at their board.\r\n\r\nThe arched roots of the fig-tree afforded him an easy mode of access to\r\nthe upper branches, where he filled his straw hat with the fruit, and\r\nthen continued his walk, enjoying the refreshment; for the figs, though\r\nnot luscious, were ripe and juicy.\r\n\r\n\"I will give one more shout,\" thought he; and his voice, cleared and\r\nstrengthened by his refreshment, rang through the echoing mountains. He\r\nwaited for five minutes; still there was no reply; but his eye caught a\r\nlight smoke among the mountains. It might be the fires of the natives he\r\nthought; but even were it so, the boys might have fallen into their\r\nhands, and no time must be lost in rescuing them. He made ready his gun,\r\nand, still bearing his load of figs, he directed his course briskly\r\ntowards the suspected spot. But it was most difficult to attain the\r\nplace from whence the smoke seemed to proceed, and he wandered for an\r\nhour amidst intricate windings, making many unsuccessful attempts to\r\npenetrate to the spot, till at length he came to a small hollow,\r\nsurrounded by dungeon-like walls, where a fire of dry wood was\r\nsmouldering, but no one was near it.\r\n\r\n\"Hugh! Gerald!\" he shouted; and at the sound of his voice his brother\r\nappeared, crawling feebly from a hole in the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Hugh, my boy, are you hurt?\" asked Arthur, in a hurried tone: \"and\r\nwhere is Gerald?\"\r\n\r\nHugh pointed to the hole from whence he had issued, and in a hoarse,\r\nweak voice, said, \"Water! water!\" Scarcely conscious what he did, Arthur\r\npressed the juice of a fig into the parched mouth of the boy, who\r\nmurmured, \"Thank God! But, oh, Arty! can you get any water for poor\r\nGerald?\"\r\n\r\nPutting more figs into his hand, Arthur stooped down to the low\r\nentrance, and passed into a small dark hollow, where Gerald was\r\nstretched out, almost insensible, and near him lay dead a huge kangaroo.\r\nArthur gave the poor boy the only refreshment he had to offer, the juice\r\nof the figs; but he seemed in a much more feeble state than Hugh, and\r\nwhen his kind friend with difficulty got him out into the open air, he\r\nsaw with consternation that his leg was bound up with a handkerchief,\r\nthrough which the blood was oozing.\r\n\r\n\"How did this happen, Hugh?\" asked Arthur, before he ventured to examine\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\n\"It was the kangaroo,\" answered he; \"and then, when we had killed it, we\r\nwere far too ill to eat it, though we have had no food since we left\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell what I must do,\" said Arthur. \"It will be impossible to\r\nget you home to-night, feeble as you are; and papa will now be in alarm\r\nat my absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will not leave us again, Arty,\" said Hugh, sobbing. \"I fear\r\ndear Gerald will die. I dare not remain alone any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must leave you for a short time,\" answered Arthur. \"I think I shall\r\nbe able to summon Wilkins and Jack to us; then they can search for\r\nwater, and carry Gerald home.\"\r\n\r\nHugh burst into tears, and said, \"But the bush-rangers--I cannot tell\r\nyou all, Arthur, my head is so bad. There are bush-rangers; we have seen\r\nthem; they will meet you, and they will come and kill us. At least,\r\ncarry Gerald back to the cave.\"\r\n\r\nIn increased alarm, Arthur conveyed Gerald into the dismal cave, and\r\nleaving them all the remainder of the figs, he waited to hear no more,\r\nbut hurried off with all speed towards the rendezvous, looking round as\r\nhe went on, for some spring or pool from which he could procure water\r\nfor the suffering boys. When he reached a high rock, not far from the\r\nrendezvous, he ventured to fire his gun, and was immediately answered by\r\nthe shouts of the men, who, following the sound and flash of the gun,\r\nsoon came up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Where are they? Oh, Mr. Arthur, have you not found them?\" said Jack.\r\n\r\nArthur, in a few words, told the distressing story; and night being now\r\nat hand, it was agreed that Jack should return to appease the uneasiness\r\nof the family, while Wilkins should accompany Arthur back to the two\r\nanxious boys, with whom they would remain till daylight, and then bring\r\nthem home. Wilkins undertook to procure water for them from a pool at a\r\nlittle distance, where Jack and he rested, and where they had cleaned\r\nout two large gourds they had found, and converted them into\r\nwater-bottles.\r\n\r\nThese gourds were a great treasure; they carried them to the pool,\r\nfilled them with fresh-water, and, after drinking themselves, hastened\r\nforward with all the vigor that remained to them after the day's\r\nfatigue, towards the spot where the boys were lying, but did not reach\r\nit till night had made it most difficult to discover it. The joy of the\r\npoor wanderers was excessive when they saw their friends arrive,\r\nbringing the refreshment they so much desired. Gerald was already\r\nsomewhat revived by the figs; and after he and Hugh had drunk some\r\nwater, they began to desire more substantial food; and it was not long\r\nbefore Wilkins had cut off, and broiled, some steaks of kangaroo\r\nvenison, of which all the hungry party partook with great enjoyment.\r\nStill the boys were too much weakened and exhausted to enter into any\r\ndetails of their adventure that night; and when Arthur and Wilkins had\r\ncollected heath for beds and covering--for the nights were now\r\nchill,--they all crept into the cave, and slept soundly till awakened by\r\nthe rude, early greeting of the laughing jackass.\r\n\r\nThen, after more kangaroo steaks, Arthur made an examination of Gerald's\r\nlacerated and bruised leg, which Hugh had previously bandaged to the\r\nbest of his skill. They could now spare water to wash the wound, and the\r\nbandages were replaced by some made from Arthur's handkerchief; and\r\nWilkins having cut down the spreading bough of a fig-tree, Gerald and\r\nthe kangaroo were placed side by side upon it, and borne by Arthur and\r\nWilkins. The procession moved slowly and silently, Hugh looking round\r\nanxiously as he preceded the litter, in dread of the terrible\r\nbush-rangers.\r\n\r\nThe rugged mountain-road tired the bearers greatly, but long before they\r\nreached the rendezvous, they saw a figure standing before the dark\r\ngum-tree, and a loud \"Halloo!\" brought Jack to meet and assist them. He\r\nhad considerately brought with him a bucket of water; and they rested\r\nand refreshed themselves, before they completed their toilsome journey.\r\nBut fatigue was forgotten when they all met again in the quiet valley;\r\nMr. Mayburn and Margaret wept for joy, and though nurse did not fail to\r\nchide them as \"bad boys,\" she fondled and nursed the wanderers, and\r\nproduced for their comfort cockatoo-stew, flavored with wild herbs that\r\nresembled parsley and marjoram, and mixed with the beans they had got on\r\nthe banks of the river.\r\n\r\n\"Keep a sentinel at the pass, Arthur,\" said Hugh. \"We shall be watched\r\nand tracked; there will be scouts all around us. It is a miracle that we\r\nhave arrived here safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Master Hugh, honey, is it that good-to-nought Black Peter?\" asked\r\nJenny.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than that, I am sorry to say, nurse,\" answered he; \"for there are\r\ndozens of Black Peters ready to snap us up. But don't look so sorrowful,\r\nMeggie, and I'll just tell you how it all happened. That big old\r\nfellow,\" pointing to the kangaroo, \"kept us trotting after him for hours\r\nand hours, and always when we got him within reach of a spear or an\r\narrow, he bounded off like a race-horse, and you could not say whether\r\nhe hopped, or galloped, or flew. It was a beautiful sight, but very\r\nvexatious. At last we got desperate; we were tired and hungry, and we\r\ndetermined to have him; so we parted, that we might attack him on both\r\nsides, and force him to stand at bay. It was a capital plan, and turned\r\nout very well. We chased him into that queer little dungeon-like hollow\r\nwhere you found us. He flew round and round, but we guarded the\r\nentrance, and he could not escape, and at last we drove him into a\r\ncorner, pierced mortally with our spears. I wanted Gerald to wait till\r\nthe beast was weakened with loss of blood; but he was in a hurry to\r\nfinish, so he rushed on with his drawn knife, and I followed to help\r\nhim. But when the brave old fellow found he had not a chance, he faced\r\nround, and with his fore-feet--his arms, I should say--he seized me, and\r\ngave me a heavy fall. Gerald was then behind, and plunged his knife into\r\nhim, on which the desperate creature struck out with his powerful hind\r\nclaw, and tore and bruised poor Gerald, as you see.\r\n\r\n\"I was soon on my feet again, and then I speedily despatched the beast;\r\nbut I should never like to kill another in that way; it was just like\r\nmurdering one's grandfather. Then I turned to poor Gerald. Oh, Margaret!\r\nif you had seen how he bled! and how frightened I was till I got his\r\nwounds tied up! He was very thirsty, and begged me to get him some\r\nwater, or he thought he must die. So off I set, keeping a sharp eye on\r\nour den, that I might find it again. I mounted a crag, and looked about\r\nme till I saw flocks of birds, all hovering over one place, a good\r\nstretch from me. 'That's my aim,' thought I, and on I dashed, over rocks\r\nand valleys, straight forward, till I saw before me a grand\r\nsilver-looking lake, covered with ducks and swans; while regiments of\r\nbirds, like cranes and pelicans, with other unknown species, were drawn\r\nup round it.\r\n\r\n\"I could look at nothing else but the birds for some time, I was so\r\ncharmed, and I planned directly to bring papa to the place the very\r\nnext day; but remembering poor Gerald's condition, I went forward, and\r\nlooking round to scan the grassy plains between the mountains and the\r\nlake, I was astonished to see a number of large animals grazing, which\r\nwere certainly not kangaroos, but real, downright quadrupeds, walking on\r\ntheir four legs. 'Here's a grand new field of natural history,' thought\r\nI. 'Yes, we must certainly take up our quarters here.' But, halloo! what\r\ndid I see that moment, hobbling ungracefully up to me, but our old\r\nfriend Charlie Grey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Charlie Grey! Edward Deverell's favorite horse!\" exclaimed Margaret.\r\n\"You have been dreaming, Hugh; it could not be!\"\r\n\r\n\"It could be, Meggie, for it really was he,\" answered Hugh. \"Do you\r\nremember how we used to feed the handsome fellow with bits of bread on\r\nthe voyage? It came into my mind just then, and I plucked a handful of\r\noats, and held them out, calling 'Charlie! Charlie!' Poor, dear old\r\nfellow! he could not trot up to me as his heart wished, but he limped\r\nforward as well as his hobbles would allow him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hobbles!\" exclaimed Wilkins; \"then he'd been nabbed by them\r\nbush-rangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough he had, Wilkins,\" continued Hugh; \"and there were five or\r\nsix strong black draught-horses, besides a herd of bullocks and cows;\r\nevery beast, I'll venture to say, stolen from our friend Edward\r\nDeverell. Well, I had forgot all about poor Gerald and the water, and\r\nwas feeding and stroking Charlie, when I saw he had a halter on his\r\nneck; and I thought I might as well just cut the hobbles, mount him,\r\nride off to take Gerald behind me, and away we would gallop home. But\r\nthe water!--I had forgotten that we had no vessel to contain water; but,\r\nfortunately, at the edge of the lake, near a place where a fire had been\r\nkindled, I saw piles of large mussel-shells. I filled two, placed them\r\nin my hat, and slung it round my neck. Then I pulled out my knife, and\r\nstooped down to cut Charlie's bonds; but just then such yells fell on my\r\nears that I started up, and saw on one of the heights a line of fierce\r\nlooking men, attired in the conspicuous yellow dress of the convicts.\r\nTheir guns were directed towards me, and there was no longer time to\r\nrelease and mount Charlie; in fact, I had not presence of mind to decide\r\non doing it, but ran off as fast as my legs would carry me, just in time\r\nto escape a volley of shots from the wretches. Thankful that I had\r\nescaped unhit, I fled desperately, never looking behind me till I\r\nreached poor Gerald, whom I found very ill and restless, parched with\r\nthirst; and there was scarcely a teaspoonful of water left in the\r\nshells, from my rapid flight. I was telling him my story, when we heard\r\na tremendous report of fire-arms, and we trembled to think the villains\r\nwere pursuing me; but now I conclude it must have been your signal-shot,\r\nan idea which never occurred to me in my distracted state. I then got\r\nGerald into that little hole, and dragged the great kangaroo after him,\r\nthat nothing suspicious might be in sight if they followed me; though I\r\nhardly dared to hope that our den should escape their observation. Dear\r\nGerald groaned and tossed about all night. How much I did grieve that I\r\nhad not succeeded in bringing him the water! Nor was our condition\r\nimproved next morning, for I was afraid to venture out beyond the\r\nhollow, round which I sought in vain for any fruit or juicy herb to cool\r\nour parched mouths. Gerald, in all his agony, was twice as brave as I\r\nwas; and if he had been the sound one, I know he would have risked any\r\ndanger to obtain help for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Botheration! Hugh, my boy,\" said Gerald, \"didn't I know all the time\r\nthat it was my moans and groans that made you turn soft and sob like a\r\ngirl? I couldn't help grunting out like a pig shut out of a cabin on a\r\nrainy night; and then you grunted and cried too, for company. We were a\r\npair of pleasant, jolly fellows all day, Meggie, as you may easily\r\nsuppose. Day, indeed, do I say! why, we thought it must be a week, at\r\nleast! As night came on, it grew very cold, and Hugh scrambled out to\r\ngather a few sticks together to make a fire before our cave. Before he\r\ncame back, I heard the crack! crack! of a gun running from rock to rock;\r\nand when I saw Hugh, I tried to speak to him; and then I know no more\r\ntill I felt the cold fig-juice on my dry tongue. Won't I like figs as\r\nlong as I live; and won't I have an alley of fig-trees in my garden when\r\nI locate--squat, I mean, and build a mansion, and marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. O'Brien may possibly object to the _Ficus_ in her garden, Gerald,\"\r\nsaid Arthur;--\"it is not a comely tree in its proportions; but the\r\nquestion may safely rest awhile. Now, Hugh, after you heard the gun?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I threw more wood upon the fire,\" answered he, \"that the smoke\r\nmight be seen, and crept back into the cave; for I could not get over\r\nthe fear that the shot might have come from the bush-rangers; and I had\r\nthus given them a signal to our hiding-place. Think of my joy when I\r\nheard the voices which I never expected to hear again!\"\r\n\r\nJenny had wept abundantly at the tale of suffering, and she now\r\nendeavored to show her sympathy by placing before the fatigued and\r\nhungry boys another collation, consisting of bean-coffee sweetened with\r\nhoney, and sweet oat-cakes; and certainly, if Mr. Mayburn had not\r\ninterfered with grave sanitary admonitions, the boys were in danger of\r\neating themselves into a fever.\r\n\r\n\"I have thought much on this unfortunate adventure,\" said Mr. Mayburn,\r\nwhen they met together the next morning. \"It is a fearful reflection to\r\nknow that we are in the midst of a horde of banditti, ready to intercept\r\nour least movement. What shall we do? We appear to be in safety here;\r\nbut this lovely spot would become a prison to you all, if you were\r\nforbidden to move from it. Arthur, what do you say? Wilkins, my good\r\nman, do you think we are quite safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not ower and above, I say, master,\" answered Wilkins; \"they're just\r\nranging hereabouts, to pick up recruits among them fools of black\r\nfellows, and to keep out of t' way of them as they've pillaged; and\r\nthey're ripe for any thieving or ill-doing as falls in their way. But\r\nthey'll not sattle long; they'll range off down south to turn their\r\nbeasts into brandy, and we'se be better at their heels nor afore 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, papa, Wilkins is right,\" said Arthur. \"We may rest a good time\r\nhere without any sacrifice of comfort. We have grain and water at hand;\r\npigeons and cockatoos in our own preserve, asking us to roast them; an\r\nexcellent store of honey, coffee, and tea, as we are pleased to name the\r\nAustralian representatives of these luxuries; spacious and dry lodgings,\r\nand fresh air. Certainly, with occasional forays, conducted with due\r\nprudence, we shall have abundant and excellent provision for any length\r\nof time. This monstrous kangaroo ought to supply us with meat for many\r\ndays; and I think we might dry part of it in the sun, to resemble the\r\nSouth-American _charqui_.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an admirable idea, Arthur,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"we shall thus\r\navoid the sin of wasting the good gifts of Providence. I have read a\r\ndescription of the process; I know the meat must be cut in slices, and I\r\nshould like to assist you in carrying out the plan, though, practically,\r\nI am inexperienced. The first difficulty appears to be, how to avoid the\r\ndestruction of the skin in slicing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, papa, we skinned him this morning,\" replied Hugh. \"The skin is\r\nalready cleaned and spread to dry; we shall rub it with a little fat, to\r\nrender it pliable, and then we shall have a blanket or a cloak of\r\ninestimable value.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, my son; I had forgotten that preliminary operation,\" said Mr.\r\nMayburn. \"But still I cannot understand how we shall obtain the large\r\nslices;--the bones, the form of the animal, present great obstacles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave it to the experienced, papa,\" said Margaret. \"Wilkins knows how\r\nto slice up a kangaroo.\"\r\n\r\nIt was capital employment and amusement for the active to cut up the\r\nhuge animal into thin slices, which were spread out on the bush, and the\r\nardent sun of the climate, even at this late season, soon dried the meat\r\nperfectly; and Margaret wove grass bags to pack it in; and thus several\r\ndays passed without alarm or annoyance; and with due care and attention\r\nthe wound of Gerald was perfectly healed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Eagle's Eyrie.--The Chaotic Solitude disturbed.--The Voluntary\r\nPrisoners.--The Report of the Spy.--The Foe at the Gates.--A Traitor in\r\nthe Camp.--Dispersion of the Invaders.--A lucky Escape.--A pleasant\r\nVoyage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a few days more had elapsed, the close confinement became irksome\r\nto all. Baldabella, accustomed to a free, roving life, pleaded her great\r\ndesire to fish by moonlight; and as there was less danger for her than\r\nfor the white men, this was permitted, and she returned safely with\r\nabundance of fish to increase the store of provisions. Then Hugh and\r\nGerald, unlucky as their last expedition had been, begged humbly that\r\nthey might be allowed to put their noses out beyond the bars of their\r\ncage.\r\n\r\n\"No, no! unruly boys,\" answered Margaret; \"you have a spacious\r\n_pleasaunce_ around you; be content and thankful to enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then surely we may climb the woods at the side?\" said Hugh. \"We want to\r\nfind the nests of the strange birds we hear above us. No harm can befall\r\nus in our own domain; it will be only like running up a ladder, the\r\nbrush is so thick and low. Come along, Gerald, and let us inspect the\r\nwonders of our aviary.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn would really have liked himself to have a peep into the many\r\nholes and crannies of the rocks, which sent forth such multitudes of\r\nbirds, and he could not object to the expedition. The agile boys made no\r\ndelay, but, clinging to the bushes, sprung up the almost perpendicular\r\nside of the mountain, disturbing the domestic peace of the tender\r\npigeons, provoking the voluble abuse of the noisy cockatoos, and\r\nfinally, at the summit, regarding with awe, at a respectful distance,\r\nthe eyrie of the dark eagle, which, with the fire of its fierce eyes,\r\ndefied their approach.\r\n\r\n\"We will avoid any offence to _Aquila_,\" said Hugh. \"We might come to\r\nthe worse again, Gerald. But where are you mounting now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only to the peak, Hugh,\" answered he. \"I should like to have a peep\r\nround, to find out what our neighborhood is.\" And the active boy soon\r\ngained the highest point, and stood there, an Australian Mercury, on the\r\n\"heaven-kissing hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a wonderful sight!\" he cried out. \"Do come up, Hugh, to see these\r\nheights, and hollows, and windings,--a rocky chaos! It is like the\r\nbeginning of a new world!\" Then turning round to observe the scene at\r\nhis left hand, he suddenly cried out, in a tone of alarm,--\"Halloo! I'm\r\nin for it now!\" and as he hastily descended from his elevated position,\r\nthe report of fire-arms, multiplied as usual among the mountains, proved\r\nthat the chaotic solitude was not free from the visitation of man.\r\n\r\n\"Down! down! hurry to them, Hugh!\" continued Gerald, now safe from the\r\nshots. \"Tell them to gather in the charqui, and the firewood, and all\r\nthings scattered about. Above all, let Ruth carry off the poultry, and\r\ngag that noisy cock; the rangers are at our heels. I shall take up my\r\nabode in this darling little oven behind the bushes, and if they should\r\nmount the ramparts, I shall be able to act spy. No words about it, but\r\nbe off. It is safer here than down below.\"\r\n\r\nThere was indeed no time for Hugh to delay, for many traces of\r\nhabitation were scattered over the valley. Buckets stood at the well;\r\nlinen was spread to dry; the charqui was exposed on the bushes; knives\r\nand axes were lying about, and the hens and chickens, and men and women,\r\nwere all out, enjoying the open air. When Hugh dropped among them,\r\nbreathless and pale, to tell his vexatious tale, they had somewhat\r\nanticipated the danger, from hearing the report of the fire-arms; and\r\nall hands were already employed to endeavor to restore to the busy\r\nvalley the wild and solitary aspect of undisturbed nature. The fowls\r\nwere collected into their coop, which was placed in a dark hollow; and\r\nthough they did not follow Gerald's advice, and gag the tell-tale cock,\r\nthey threw a large cloak over the coop, and chanticleer, duped into the\r\nbelief that it was night, folded his wings, and, mounted on his perch,\r\nresigned himself to repose amidst his family.\r\n\r\nWhen they had restored to the lately populous vale as natural an\r\nappearance as circumstances would allow, they all withdrew into the\r\nlargest cave, and filled up the entrance, with an appearance of artful\r\ndisorder, with rocky fragments, very impatient for Gerald's return to\r\nreport the extent of the danger to which they were exposed, and the best\r\nmode of escaping from it. But after waiting a considerable time in their\r\ngloomy prison, weary of compelled inaction, every heart was filled with\r\nanxiety at the protracted absence of the adventurous boy. Three hours\r\nelapsed, and after listening and looking through the crevices of the\r\nrock in vain, Arthur was on the point of venturing out to ascend the\r\ncliffs himself, when Gerald's voice was heard whispering through a\r\nnarrow opening, \"Is it a serpent or a genie you think I am, to glide\r\nthrough this peep-hole? Open sesame!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no time lost in admitting the welcome visitor. \"Now, then!\"\r\nsaid he; \"quick! quick! the foe is at the gate. Now, my boys, do the\r\nthing nately, as we Irish say. We mustn't build it up like a wall you\r\nsee, Jack.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not built like a wall; but by the united strength of the party,\r\nan immense mass of rock was rolled before the opening, which nearly\r\nclosed it, the pendent branches from above concealing the fissures, and\r\naffording light and a means of making observations in safety.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Gerald,\" said Margaret, \"I beseech you to tell me what is the\r\nmeaning of all this alarm?\"\r\n\r\n\"All my fault; my ill luck again, Meggie,\" answered he. \"I would erect\r\nmyself like a statue at the very summit of the mountains; and from\r\nthence I saw on a plain below half a dozen fellows mounted on horseback,\r\nwhom I recognized, by their canary-colored garments, to be those wicked\r\nconvicts. I sank down from my eminence in a moment, but not before the\r\nhawk-eyed rogues had seen me and fired. I was not hit; but I expected\r\nthey would be after me if they could climb through the brush, so I crept\r\ninto a snug little hollow just below the peak, arranged my leafy\r\ncurtains in an elegant manner, and waited to receive my company so long\r\nthat I had really dropped asleep, and was only awaked by the rough,\r\ncoarse voices of men swearing and using language which I have done my\r\nbest to forget altogether.\r\n\r\n\"They seemed to be in a great rage, and one wicked wretch swore\r\ndreadfully and said, 'It's the same ugly little cove as we blazed at\r\nafore. He's a spy sent out by them p'lice, and he's off to inform\r\nagainst us. We'll burn him alive if we lay hands on him.'\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to be burnt alive, so I crept into a corner, and lay\r\nstill as a mouse.\r\n\r\n\"'T' other chap were bigger, I say,' growled another fellow.\r\n\r\n\"'Haud yer jaw,' answered the first; 'think ye they keep a pack of young\r\nhounds like this to point free rangers? But where's he slunk?'\r\n\r\n\"'I say, Bill,' called out a third voice, 'look ye down here. It's a\r\nsnug, cunning hole; will 't be t' p'lice office, think ye?'\r\n\r\n\"'How'd they get at it, man?' replied Bill. 'Dost thee think they've got\r\nwings to flee down?'\r\n\r\n\"'I'se warrant ye, we'll somehow find a road into it,' said the first\r\nvoice. 'We'se try, at ony end; for we'll have to clear our way afore we\r\nset out on another spree. I'se about tired of eating flesh, now t'\r\nbrandy's all swallowed; and if we could light on Black Peter, we'd be\r\noff on some grand job to set us up again.'\r\n\r\n\"'Halloo! lads! what's this?'\r\n\r\n\"Then I heard oaths, and strange screams, and blows, and something heavy\r\nflopped past my den, screaming; and wasn't I in a grand fright to think\r\nthat one of these rogues had found such a ready road down to our\r\ngrounds. But I soon heard the men above me again, cursing the venomous\r\nbird; and I guessed then that they had fallen in with our friend\r\n_Aquila_, and, perhaps, been worsted. I ventured cautiously to look\r\ndown, and saw the poor eagle fluttering and hopping about below, half\r\nkilled by the brutes no doubt; but by degrees I heard their voices dying\r\naway, and was sure they were withdrawing. Then I took courage, and\r\nslipped down my rude ladder as briskly as a lamp-lighter, and was with\r\nyou, only pausing a moment to look at the poor eagle as I passed, lying\r\ncrouched in a corner covered with blood, and extending a broken wing.\r\nAnd now, Arthur, don't you think our citadel is in danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I do, Gerald,\" answered Arthur. \"All we can do is to keep\r\nclosely hidden as long as we can, and then to fight for our dear friends\r\nwho cannot fight for themselves. We have weapons,--spears, arrows, and\r\ntwo rifles; and we have a capital position for defending the weak. If\r\nthere be no more than six men, we will defy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be capital,\" said Gerald,--\"a regular siege. How is the\r\ncastle provisioned, Jenny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, lucky enough, Master Gerald,\" answered she, \"we fetched in here,\r\nbecause it was nighest at hand, all the dried meat, and the skin, and we\r\nfilled the buckets before we brought them from the well; and that's just\r\nwhat we have, barring a few cakes; for one never looked for being shut\r\nup here like. There's all the oats, and the tea and coffee, and the\r\nfirewood, are left in what we called our kitchen.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'se do,\" said Wilkins, \"we'se soon sattle their business, I reckon,\"\r\nlooking grimly at the edge of his knife as he sharpened it upon a stone;\r\nadding, \"And how and about them guns, captain? Who's to work 'em?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall take one myself,\" answered Arthur; \"and if I thought I could\r\ntrust to your discretion, Wilkins, I would put the other into your\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may trust me for bringing down my bird,\" said the man; \"that's\r\nwhat I were always up to, or I hadn't been here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I mean you to understand by discretion, Wilkins,\" said Arthur,\r\n\"is, that you are not to fire till I order you; and then to _wing_, not\r\nto bring down your bird.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's the good of that?\" remonstrated Wilkins; \"it's like giving\r\na rogue a ticket of leave, just to turn a thief into a murderer; that's\r\nwhat ye'll get for being soft. I ken my chaps: ye'd better make an end\r\non 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be unjust and inhuman,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"These mistaken men\r\nmay not intend to hurt any of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except to burn me alive, sir,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"That, I apprehend, my boy,\" answered Mr. Mayburn, \"was but an\r\nexaggerated form of speech. But, hark! what noise do I hear?\"\r\n\r\nSounds were heard like the rolling of stones. Arthur commanded silence,\r\nas every thing depended on their remaining watchful and still. Then\r\nvoices were distinguished, and, through the green pendent branches, men\r\nwere seen in the tranquil valley,--men in the felon's marked dress of\r\ngrey and yellow, ferocious in aspect, coarse and blasphemous in\r\nlanguage. Mr. Mayburn shuddered as he heard, for the first time, the\r\noaths and defiant words of hardened infidels; and the good man kneeled\r\ndown to pray that God would visit with a ray of grace these lost\r\nsinners.\r\n\r\n\"Ay! ay!\" cried one, \"here are the tracks of the gentry coves: and look\r\nye, Jem, here's a woman's bit of a shoemark. What will they be acting\r\nhere, I'd like to know. If we could fall on that saucy lad now, I'd\r\njust wring his neck about for him.\"\r\n\r\nGerald made up a queer face at Hugh, but they did not dare to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Will they have oughts of cash with them?\" growled another man. \"What do\r\nwe want with women and lads?\"\r\n\r\n\"To trade with 'em, man,\" answered the other; \"to swop 'em yonder among\r\nt' squatters for cash down. We'll thrust some of them black fellows\r\nforward to bargain for us; they're easy wrought on to do a job like\r\nthat. But where can their den be? they're surely flitted.\"\r\n\r\nExamining every open cave and hollow in the surrounding rocks, the men,\r\nusing the most violent and abusive language, searched the little valley\r\nin vain; and the anxious prisoners began to hope that they would soon be\r\nwearied out and retire, when suddenly they were appalled by a shrill\r\ntriumphant crow from the little bantam cock, which had probably\r\ndiscovered the deception practised on him. A momentary silence was\r\nfollowed by shouts and loud laughter, as the invaders rushed to the\r\nprison-house of the impatient fowls.\r\n\r\nWilkins muttered unspeakable words, and darted a furious glance at Ruth;\r\nand Gerald, with a deep low groan, whispered, \"A traitor in the camp!\"\r\nwhile Ruth climbed up to an opening, in great alarm, to observe the fate\r\nof her beloved pets. That was soon determined. The voice of the unlucky\r\nbird had plainly pointed out its abode; the stony prison was forced\r\nopen; a crowing, a screaming, and a fluttering were heard; two of the\r\nfowls were seen to fly awkwardly to the bushes, above the reach of the\r\nmarauders, and chanticleer was beheld by his distracted mistress, swung\r\nround lifeless, with his head grasped by his destroyer.\r\n\r\nAt this cruel spectacle, the simple girl could no longer control her\r\nfeelings. She uttered a piercing shriek; Jenny sprang on her too late to\r\nstop the indiscretion, and dragged her from the opening, shaking her\r\nviolently, and even provoked so far as to administer a little sound\r\nboxing of the ears, declaring that the girl ought to be hanged; while\r\nWilkins, with ill-repressed fury, shook his hand at the unfortunate\r\noffender, and then said, \"It's all up now! Stand to yer guns, my\r\nhearties; we'se have a tight bout on 't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, man the walls!\" cried Gerald,--\r\n\r\n    \"'Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit\r\n    To his full height! On, on, ye noble English!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Quieter ye are, t' better, Mr. Gerald,\" said Wilkins. \"What say ye, Mr.\r\nArthur, if we fix on our port-holes; and then, if we pick out our chaps,\r\nwe'll soon thin 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"Such a proceeding would be unfair; the\r\nmen would not even see their enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"An ambush is always fair in the strategy of war,\" said Hugh. \"These men\r\nare invaders, papa, and we have a right to drive them off.\"\r\n\r\nThe affair soon came to a crisis; the cry of Ruth had not passed\r\nunnoticed. The men rushed up to the fortress, and with stones and clubs\r\nendeavored to force an entrance. A volley of shots and arrows drove them\r\nback, wounded, and furious in their language; but when the firing\r\nceased, they took courage, and again advanced to renew the attempt. This\r\ntime aim was taken, and two men fell dead, or desperately wounded; and\r\nthey retired once more, and entered into some consultation unheard by\r\ntheir opponents. Then a villainous-looking fellow cried out, in a\r\ntaunting manner,\r\n\r\n\"I say, ye cowardly chaps, show yer faces, and 'liver yersel's up afore\r\nyer forced to it; we'se use ye well, and keep ye till ye raise cash to\r\npay yer ransom. Else, mark my words, if ye send any more of yer\r\nmurdering shots, we'll take ye at last, and twist all yer necks while\r\nyer living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mistaken man!\" cried Mr. Mayburn, \"why will you provoke the wrath of\r\nGod by causing desolation and slaughter among his glorious works? Know\r\nyou not that for all these things God will bring you to judgment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Halloo!\" cried the wretch; \"what! ye've gotten a missioner amang ye.\r\nHe'll do precious little harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"His only desire is to do good,\" said Arthur. \"But you are mistaken if\r\nyou think us cowards. We have brave men among us, who will not submit to\r\nany treaty with convicts. We have nothing to give you; we are\r\nshipwrecked voyagers, who have only saved our guns, and with them we\r\nwill defend our lives and liberty. We do not wish to injure you if you\r\nwill leave us in peace; and you have neither means nor numbers to\r\novercome us.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'se see about that,\" answered the man. \"We'se soon raise force to\r\nburn or starve ye out.\"\r\n\r\nAnother consultation succeeded; and finally they departed, leaving the\r\nbesieged under the disagreeable impression that they had only departed\r\nto procure a reinforcement.\r\n\r\n\"What a different set of fellows Robin Hood's Free Rangers were,\" said\r\nHugh. \"Gerald and I have many a time longed to have lived in merry\r\nSherwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawlessness inevitably leads to crime,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"I fear the\r\nhalo of chivalry and romance blinds us as to the real character of those\r\noutlaws.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Hugh,\" said Arthur; \"if your bold archers of Sherwood were to\r\nattempt their troublesome frolics in these days, the police would soon\r\narrest their course, and we should see Robin Hood and his merry men\r\nplaced on the treadmill.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no time to talk about treadmills, Mr. Arthur,\" said Wilkins.\r\n\"T' boats is safe; and what say ye if we be off? They'll not be back yet\r\na bit; for they'll have to gather up them black fellows and talk 'em\r\nower wi' lots of lies; but if we were out of this queer hole and just\r\nfree-like on t' water, we'd manage to distance yon awkward scamps yet.\r\nBut we ought to start off-hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good man,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"I feel in greater safety here than if\r\nI were wandering through the labyrinths of these mountains, where we\r\nmight any moment be surprised and captured.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must send out a scout,\" said Arthur. \"Who will be the safest? I\r\nobject to no one but Gerald, who would inevitably rush into the camp of\r\nthe enemy.\"\r\n\r\nGerald bowed to the compliment, and Wilkins said, \"I've a sort of\r\nnotion, Mr. Arthur, as how Baldabella would suit better nor ony of us.\r\nYe see, these jins are used to spying work.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Baldabella fully understood the important service required of her,\r\nshe started up, ready at once to undertake it, and as soon as the heavy\r\nbarrier was moved, glided through the aperture, and fled lightly on her\r\nerrand. During her absence, the rest made ready all their burdens again\r\nfor recommencing their pilgrimage; and the time seemed incredibly short\r\ntill the woman returned with a bright countenance, saying,--\"Bad men go\r\nmuch far; smoke for black fellows come. White man go away now; very\r\nhush; no see he be gone.\"\r\n\r\nReassured by her words, the family emerged from their stronghold. The\r\nmen pulled down the stones they had piled to conceal the canoes, brought\r\nthem out, and then, heavily laden, commenced their march. But at the\r\nmoment of departure a loud clucking of the escaped fowls arrested the\r\nweeping Ruth, who summoned, by calls and scattered grains, the small\r\nremainder of her charge,--two fowls; which she placed once more in their\r\ncoop, and with a lightened heart, disregarded this addition to her\r\nburden, and followed the procession, which was now led by Baldabella,\r\nwho had discovered the shortest road through the windings of the\r\nmountains to the banks of the river. When the welcome stream was seen\r\nbefore them, the boats were once more launched and laden, and on the\r\nsmooth but rapid river they were quickly carried from the scene of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\"That rogue who argued with you, Arthur,\" said Gerald, \"was the very\r\nfellow that threatened to burn me alive, and sure enough, if we had\r\nsurrendered to them, we should all have been piled up for a bonfire.\r\nDon't you think so, Wilkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Master Gerald,\" answered he, \"I'll not say that, 'cause as how\r\nthey could have made nought of our dead bones. Money's what they look\r\nto: they'd sell us, plunder us, strip us of every rag we have, but,\r\nbarrin' we went again 'em, and wrought 'em up, mad-like, they'd hardly\r\ntrouble to burn us. But I'll not say how it might be if they turned us\r\nower to them hungry black fellows; they'd likely enough roast and eat\r\nus, but white chaps has no stomach for meat of that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither can we flee to avoid these desperate cannibals?\" said Mr.\r\nMayburn. \"Do you conceive, Wilkins, that the river is really the safest\r\ncourse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Safe enough, master,\" answered the man, \"so long as we stick to our\r\nboats, and can keep our jaws at work. But we'se want meat, and them\r\nblack fellows gets thicker farther south. We'se fall in with mony an\r\nill-looking lot on 'em as we run down; and likely enough, we'se have to\r\nrattle a shot at 'em nows and thens.\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid that we should be compelled to shed more blood,\" said Mr.\r\nMayburn. \"I feel my heart oppressed with sorrow when I behold the sin\r\nand ignorance of these people, and, alas! I know not how to alleviate\r\nit: I can only pray for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will trust that our prayers may avail with a merciful God,\" said\r\nMargaret; \"and if we should be permitted to reach the estate of Edward\r\nDeverell, we will all labor, papa, to diffuse instruction around us; and\r\nin His own good time, I trust, God will spread the light of His truth to\r\nthe remotest corner of these yet barbarous regions. I feel already as if\r\nI saw Daisy Grange plainly before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's mony a hundred mile atween us and them ye talk on,\" said\r\nWilkins, morosely; \"and I'se be cast away sure enough when ye turn in\r\namong them squatters. They're all sharp enough to put their claws on an\r\nidle vagabond like me, and send him back to chains and hard commons.\"\r\n\r\n\"That shall never be, Wilkins,\" replied Hugh. \"It is settled that you\r\nand I are never to part; and if Edward Deverell should refuse to receive\r\nyou, we will squat by ourselves; like Robinson Crusoe and his man\r\nFriday, build a hut, and shoot kangaroos.\"\r\n\r\nArthur laughed at the plan of a separate establishment, and assured\r\nWilkins of certain protection in that home they pined to reach; and a\r\ncalm and pleasant hope now filled every heart, as hours and days passed\r\neasily while they sailed down the broad river undisturbed by cares or\r\ndread, till the failure of provisions and a great change in the scenery\r\nroused them from their pleasant dream.\r\n\r\n\"This is a melancholy and desert-like heath,\" said Arthur, as he looked\r\nbeyond the low banks upon a wide extent grown over with the low\r\nentangled brush; \"but we must make a foraging party to replenish our\r\nbaskets. I can see on some marshy patches a scattering of wild oats, and\r\nwe may hope to find some of the feathered gluttons that feed on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And please to bring some tea-leaves, if you can find them, Mr. Arthur,\"\r\nsaid Jenny; \"I get on badly without a drop of tea, such as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys,\" said Arthur, \"get out the axes. We must clear a place among\r\nthe reeds for Margaret and my father; then we will moor the canoes\r\nsafely, and leave a guard to watch them, while we go off on our\r\nexploring expedition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Cookery disturbed.--A Signal-rocket.--A Surprise and\r\nCapture.--Pillage.--The Taste of Gunpowder.--A Fatal Explosion.--The\r\nContrivances of Necessity.--A Region of Famine.--Renewed Hopes.--An\r\nUnfair Advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nA nook was soon cleared, where the family landed, and the light canoes\r\nwere drawn close to shore, and moored to the canes. Then the fine rushes\r\nwere cut down and spread to form seats for Margaret and her father; and\r\nArthur, with Wilkins and Jack, set out with guns and bows, leaving Hugh\r\nand O'Brien to guard the encampment. Baldabella then went off with her\r\nspear, and soon pierced several large fish; and while Mr. Mayburn took\r\nout his book, and Margaret talked to Nakinna, Jenny and Ruth made a fire\r\nto broil the fish.\r\n\r\nAlready the cooking began to smell temptingly, and the hungry little\r\ngirl was dancing joyfully about the fire, watching till the repast was\r\nready, when Baldabella suddenly threw down her spear, started forward,\r\nand laying her hand on Margaret's arm, she held up her finger in an\r\nattitude of warning, and bent forward as if listening. Then drawing a\r\ndeep sigh, she whispered through her closed teeth--\"Baldabella hear him,\r\nmissee; black fellow come--one, two, many--eat missee--eat Nakinna--burn\r\nall!\" Then snatching up her child, she gazed wildly round, and her fears\r\nwere confirmed a minute after, by the fatal cry ringing through the\r\nreeds, which announced the proximity of the dreaded natives.\r\n\r\nThe boys, who were rambling about among the bamboos, searching for\r\nnests, at the vexatious sound of the _coo-ee_, left their spoil to hurry\r\nto the encampment, and entreat their father and sister to embark at once\r\nand seek safety; but Mr. Mayburn could not be persuaded to leave the\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\n\"Then let us make a sally to bring them up,\" said Gerald; \"no time\r\nshould be lost; we have our bows to defend ourselves, though they\r\ncarried the guns with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they must have heard the _coo-ee_ as well as we did,\" replied Hugh,\r\n\"and, depend on it, they are on the road back to us. I say, nurse, we\r\nmust eat our fish cold; just pull that fire to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nRuth the unlucky, always officious, took a bucket of water and threw it\r\nover the blazing sticks; on which a dark, dense smoke rose up from them\r\nlike a column, and the cries of the natives were now heard loud and\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Ruth, Ruth!\" said Hugh, \"you have sent up a signal-rocket to them.\r\nMargaret and papa, do step into the canoe; there is more safety on the\r\nriver than here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see that, Hugh,\" answered Mr. Mayburn; \"the water is so\r\nshallow here, that they could wade to us, and we must not run down the\r\nstream and leave our kind foragers.\"\r\n\r\nA loud rustling and crackling among the reeds prevented more words; the\r\nboys would have sent their arrows into the thicket, but Margaret\r\nbesought, and Mr. Mayburn commanded, that they should not begin\r\naggression, and a few minutes rendered these weapons absolutely useless,\r\nfor they were closely surrounded by a numerous tribe of natives,\r\ncarrying spears. But the anxious voyagers soon discovered that the\r\npeople were peacefully inclined, for they made no attempt to injure the\r\nstrangers, but with loud cries and rapidly-uttered words, seemed to\r\nexpress astonishment rather than anger.\r\n\r\nOne man took Margaret's large sun-hat from her head and placed it on his\r\nown, which so much delighted the rest, that all the hats of the party\r\nwere coolly and speedily appropriated, without any opposition from the\r\nrightful owners, except from Ruth, who tied her bonnet so firmly under\r\nher chin, that the rough attempts of the man to tear it from her head\r\nnearly strangled her, till Margaret stepped forward to relieve her by\r\nloosing the strings.\r\n\r\nO'Brien, also, was so indignant when one of the savages came to claim\r\nhis hat, that he flung it into the river, but the man leaped in and\r\nrescued it, and at the same time he discovered the canoes, and summoned\r\nhis friends vociferously to look on these new treasures. In the mean\r\ntime the fish already cooked was devoured by some of the natives, and\r\nthe rest revived the fire to cook the remainder of Baldabella's spoil.\r\n\r\nJenny's shawl was next discovered, and appropriated by a bold marauder,\r\nwho threw it, in not ungraceful drapery, over his uncovered shoulders.\r\nAnother savage stripped from Ruth a large cloak which she had hastily\r\nput on to conceal the basket which contained her last two fowls, which\r\nshe held on her arm. This basket was a new prize, and the fowls were\r\nregarded with much curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! tell 'em not to twine their necks about, Mistress Baldabella,\"\r\ncried Ruth. \"Tell 'em what bonnie creaters they are, laying every day,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nBut Baldabella, shy and fearful, had slunk behind the rest, and Margaret\r\nundertook to point out to the robber the value of the fowls, by showing\r\nhim the eggs and caressing the birds. The man grinned, to express that\r\nhe understood the explanation, sucked the eggs, and then walked off with\r\nbasket and fowls, leaving Ruth in complete despair.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment, Arthur issued from among the reeds, and started\r\nback, overcome with amazement and dismay, at the sight of the dark crowd\r\nwhich thronged the little clearance. He was immediately surrounded, and\r\nbefore he could offer any effectual resistance, his gun and hat were\r\ntaken away, as well as a bag of pigeons that was hung over his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Baldabella,\" said he, \"ask the chief of the tribe what he wants from\r\nus. We will give him the birds, and some knives and axes; but his people\r\nmust then go away, and leave us our canoes and our guns.\"\r\n\r\nBaldabella reluctantly came forward, and bending her head down as she\r\napproached the chief, repeated her message in a submissive tone, and the\r\nsavage replied in a long harangue which made the poor woman tremble, and\r\nwhich she interpreted to her friends, greatly abridged, saying:--\"Black\r\nfellow say, he take all: he very angry. Good white friend all\r\nrun--fast--go away! Meny, much meny, black fellows come--all very\r\nhungry--eat fish--eat bird--eat all white friend. Go fast,\r\nmassa;--missee, good friend, go away!\"\r\n\r\nThis was decidedly sound advice; but under the present circumstances it\r\nwas no easy task for the large party to run away. Wilkins and Jack had\r\njoined them, and were immediately seized by the savages, disarmed, and\r\nheld fast by their captors. The attack was too sudden to allow them any\r\nopposition, and Jack looked deeply distressed, while Wilkins was\r\nabsolutely furious, till a few words from Arthur induced them to submit\r\nwith quietness to have their game and their hats taken away from them.\r\n\r\nThen the robbers paused, evidently lost in admiration of the complicated\r\ndress of their captives, which they seemed desirous to possess, but were\r\npuzzled how to separate the garments from the wearer, or probably\r\ndoubtful whether they did not actually form a part of that anomalous\r\ncreature, a white man. It was plain, however, that Baldabella and her\r\nchild were of their own race, and the chief went up to her, and\r\ncommanded her to follow him, and become one of his jins. The poor woman,\r\nin terror and indignation, refused his request, and turned to flee from\r\nhim; the savage immediately seized the child, and the alarmed mother,\r\nsupported by Arthur and Hugh, tried in vain to rescue the screaming\r\ngirl, till the man, in a violent rage, sprung forward to the river, and\r\nflung the child into the water. But in a moment Hugh leaped in after it,\r\nand brought the half-senseless child to the distracted mother, who had\r\nplunged in after him herself.\r\n\r\nBut now the chief's attention was diverted from Baldabella to the spoils\r\nof his victims; and some of the men were sent off with baskets,\r\nportmanteaus, knives, axes, guns, and all the precious possessions of\r\nthe unfortunate travellers, who momentarily expected to be murdered as\r\nwell as pillaged.\r\n\r\nWhen the canoes had been completely ransacked, four of the men carried\r\nthem off, while the rest were collected round a skin bag which contained\r\ntheir valuable ammunition. One of the natives drew out a canister of\r\ngunpowder, forced it open, and filled his mouth with the powder. With\r\nludicrous grimaces, he spat out the nauseous mixture, and raised his\r\nhand to fling the rest upon the fire. Arthur saw the motion, and calling\r\non his friends to escape, he rushed up, hoping to arrest the arm of the\r\nignorant man; but he was too late, and though he retreated the moment he\r\nsaw the canister flying through the air, he was prostrated senseless by\r\nthe fearful explosion that followed.\r\n\r\nThe very earth shook beneath their feet, and such of the natives as were\r\nnot actually stunned by the shock, fled, with cries of horror, into the\r\nbush, which was already blazing in several places from the burning\r\nfragments of the fire cast in all directions. The emancipated prisoners\r\nhad all, with the exception of Arthur, reached in safety the edge of the\r\nriver; and though trembling and much shaken, they had not sustained any\r\ninjury. Arthur was brought to them perfectly insensible; but in a few\r\nminutes, when water had been plentifully poured over him, he recovered,\r\nand except a nervous tremor that lasted many hours, and the loss of his\r\nhair, which was completely scorched off, no serious consequences\r\nsucceeded his perilous accident.\r\n\r\nBut though temporarily relieved from the presence of the savages, they\r\nwere still in the midst of great dangers. The dry blazing reeds rendered\r\nfurther progress impossible; and they gratefully thanked God that the\r\nlittle spot they had cleared for their landing now afforded them a\r\nsecure refuge.\r\n\r\nThe wind carried the flames rapidly down the east bank of the river\r\ntowards the south; and they waited in great agitation till a path should\r\nbe opened for them to proceed. Their anxious silence was interrupted by\r\nthe sound of a low musical wail, so expressive of sorrow that it pained\r\nevery heart; and on looking round, they saw the dirge proceeded from\r\nBaldabella, who was bending over the body of the native who had perished\r\nin the explosion caused by his own ignorance, and now lay a blackened\r\ncorpse on the spot from whence he had flung the canister.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was kneeling by her mother, seeming to be conscious of\r\nthe solemnity of the ceremony, and raising her feeble voice, in\r\nimitation of her mother. Much affected, Mr. Mayburn drew near them, and\r\nbriefly and simply explained to the tender-hearted woman the uselessness\r\nof mourning over the hapless dead, and the lesson his sudden fate\r\nafforded to the living; and he begged her to join him in the prayer that\r\nthey might all live so watchfully, that the hour of death might never\r\nsurprise them unprepared. The plain truths of Christianity had fallen\r\nwith good effect on the mind of the grateful and gentle woman, and Mr.\r\nMayburn hoped earnestly that she and her child had been, by God's mercy,\r\nrescued from darkness.\r\n\r\n\"And now, let us turn away from this sad spectacle, my good woman,\"\r\ncontinued Mr. Mayburn, \"and endeavor to escape from this burning\r\nwilderness, for we all have work to do in the world. Arthur, will you,\r\nwith your usual prudence, decide which way we shall turn? The flames are\r\nraging before us, and these savage natives may, at any moment, beset us\r\nfrom behind. My judgment fails to point out any escape; but, Arthur, I\r\nwill pray for God's assistance, that you may be enabled to save us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may retrace our path up the river--a discouraging journey!\" said\r\nArthur; \"or we may wait till the devouring flames have cleared a road\r\nfor us; but the delay is perilous. Even should we try to force our way\r\neast, into yon barren desert, destitute as we now are, we should only\r\nobtain a change of evils; and I am reluctant to leave the friendly\r\nriver, where alone we can hope to obtain food and water.\"\r\n\r\nBaldabella pointed across the broad river, and said, \"Go quick there,\r\nfind many root, many nut, no black fellow. Bad black fellow come back\r\nsoon, paint all white; very angry, see brother dead; kill all white man,\r\neat Nakinna, carry away Baldabella! God never come to black fellow.\"\r\n\r\nTo cross the river did certainly seem the most desirable plan; but how\r\nto effect the transit was a perplexing question. It was about a hundred\r\nyards across, but, as far as they could judge, not more than from four\r\nto five feet deep at any part; so that the young men would have no\r\ndifficulty in wading across; but to the women, and even to Mr. Mayburn,\r\nsuch an undertaking would be very difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nJack looked round in despair; there were no trees, and even if there had\r\nbeen any, he had no axe. They examined carefully the field of plunder,\r\nin hopes some tool or utensil might have been overlooked by the\r\nplunderers; but, except the spear of the fallen native, and the\r\nfishing-spear of Baldabella, nothing had been left behind. Wilkins had\r\nfortunately preserved a long knife which he wore under his blouse; and,\r\nfrom the mysterious form of the dresses, the pockets had escaped being\r\nrifled.\r\n\r\nJack looked joyfully at the knife, and said, \"We might cut some of these\r\nthick tall reeds, and make a float for them, Mr. Arthur. I have a few\r\nloose nails in my pocket, and here's a stone with a hole through it; we\r\ncan fix a reed handle to it, and then it will make shift for a hammer.\r\nWe could easily guide them over on a float of this sort, it's my\r\nopinion.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at least desirable to make the experiment; so without delay the\r\nstrong bamboos were cut, broken, or torn down; a range of them placed\r\nflat, close together on the ground, connected by transverse bars, which\r\nwere fastened somewhat imperfectly with Jack's precious \"loose nails.\" A\r\nquarter of an hour completed this slight frame; in which time the\r\nconflagration, which had run to some distance down the banks of the\r\nriver, had left a scorched and smoking clearance, disclosing the bodies\r\nof three more victims, who had not been able to escape the rapid flames.\r\nThe boys found also several nests of half-roasted water-fowls, which\r\nthey snatched away at some risk from the heated ground, and brought\r\nforward for a needful repast.\r\n\r\n\"If we had but saved the ropes!\" exclaimed Jack. But ropes were not\r\nattainable, nor even that excellent substitute for them, the stringy\r\nbark; and the raft was launched on the river, to be drawn or urged\r\nacross by the strong arms of the men. Margaret, at her own request, was\r\nthe first to venture on the frail machine, guided on one side by Jack,\r\nand on the other by Wilkins, who waded, and in some places swam, and\r\nbrought their charge in safety to the opposite bank, which was covered\r\nwith reeds like that which they had left.\r\n\r\nIn this way the strong men successively brought over Mr. Mayburn and the\r\ntwo women. Baldabella, with her child on her shoulder and her\r\nfishing-spear in her hand, plunged at once into the water, followed by\r\nArthur, who insisted on her holding his hand through the deepest part.\r\nFinally, after a sorrowful look at the scene of their losses, and a vain\r\nsearch for any trifling article of their property, the two boys followed\r\ntheir friends. Then the disconsolate travellers, forcing their way\r\nthrough the reedy thicket, stood to gaze with consternation on the wild\r\nbarren region that spread before them.\r\n\r\n\"God has pleased to cast us feeble and destitute into this wide\r\nwilderness,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"of ourselves, we can do nothing, but He\r\nis mighty to save. He rescued us from the murdering savage, from flood,\r\nand from fire, and He will not suffer us to perish from famine, if we\r\npray and trust. Let us lift up our hands and voices in thanksgiving and\r\nsubmission.\"\r\n\r\nThe rough convict, the ignorant Baldabella, and the simple child joined\r\nearnestly in the devotions of their more enlightened friends; and\r\nrefreshed and hopeful, they rose from their knees, \"to walk in faith the\r\ndarkling paths of earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we can but keep near the river,\" said Margaret, \"we cannot perish\r\nfor want; and, besides, it seems to lead us in the very path we wish to\r\nfollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fish is better nor starving,\" said Wilkins; \"but I reckon we'se soon\r\ntire on't, if we come on nought better. What's come to t' lass now?\"\r\naddressing Ruth, who was weeping.\r\n\r\n\"I've gone and roven a hole in my boot,\" sobbed she, \"and I don't know\r\nhow ever I'se to git it mended.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys laughed at the small distress of Ruth; but, after all, it was\r\nno laughing matter for her. To walk over the brush-covered plain, or\r\namong the dry reeds, was a trying exertion even for the well-shod, and\r\nMargaret was dismayed when she considered how this could be accomplished\r\nwhen their boots should fail. \"Yet why dare I doubt?\" she said. \"See,\r\nRuth; Baldabella, and even little Nakinna, walk as well as we do, and\r\nthey are barefooted. We must not shrink from such small trials as this.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a pair of the splendid bronze pigeons, so unequalled in beauty\r\nby any of their race, winged their flight from the water above the heads\r\nof the travellers; and though they no longer had the means of obtaining\r\nthese birds, as delicious in taste as they are lovely in plumage, they\r\nwere satisfied to see there were animals in the waste around them.\r\n\r\n\"These thin bamboos would make capital arrows,\" said Hugh; \"and I have\r\nno doubt we can bend one of these tall canes for a bow, if we had but\r\nthe means of stringing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might, at all events, sharpen some of the canes for spears,\" said\r\nArthur, \"not only for defence in need, but to be useful if we should be\r\nso fortunate as to encounter a kangaroo, or meet with the burrows of the\r\nwombats.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has become of our raft?\" asked Margaret \"You had there a good\r\nstock of bamboos ready cut.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my nails in them,\" exclaimed Jack. \"What a fool I was not to\r\nremember that in time; now it will be far enough down the river.\"\r\n\r\nIt was too true: the raft had already been carried away by the stream\r\nout of their sight; and all deeply regretted their negligence, as they\r\nmoved slowly through the entangled scrub, frequently compelled to walk\r\nactually over the low bushes. On the opposite shore of the river they\r\ncould still discover the wild flames flying down before the wind, and\r\nleaving behind a black smoking surface.\r\n\r\nWhen wearied with the excitement and toil of the day, they were\r\ncompelled to seek rest among the comfortless reeds, they sat down and\r\nlooked at each other for some time rather sorrowfully, for the pressure\r\nof hunger had fallen on all. It was Baldabella who first relieved their\r\ndistress; with untired energy she went to the river with her spear, and\r\nreturned very soon with a large river-cod, and an apron filled with the\r\nfresh-water mussels, now truly prized for their useful shells. A fire\r\nwas soon made, the fish was spitted on a sharpened reed, and while it\r\nwas roasting, Hugh, with Wilkins's invaluable knife, cut a number of\r\nshort thin reeds into chopsticks, as he called them, to enable them to\r\nconvey the roasted fish from the reeds on which it was dished to their\r\nmouths. Rude as the contrivance was, and laughable as were the failures\r\nmade in using their new utensils, they managed to make a satisfactory\r\nsupper, and were content to sleep among the reeds in the open air,\r\nthough the nights now felt exceedingly cold.\r\n\r\nFor several days they continued to toil on along the reedy banks of the\r\nriver, over the same cheerless bush, and subsisting on the same\r\nunvarying fish diet. Then the banks became rocky and precipitous, and\r\nthe river so difficult of access that it was only at rare openings they\r\nwere able to obtain water or fish. But soon after the landscape was\r\nenlivened once more by tall trees. Their path was over the grassy\r\nplains, which were even now, in the winter of the year, gay with bright\r\nflowers. More than once they remarked with thankfulness the track of the\r\nkangaroo, and the chattering of birds gave them hopes of new food, and\r\nthey anxiously sought the means of obtaining them.\r\n\r\nWith what joy they recognized the stringy-bark tree, and gathered the\r\nfibres to twist into bowstrings, and with what triumph did Hugh, the\r\nfirst who finished the rude weapon, draw his rough string and bring down\r\npigeons and cockatoos sufficient for an ample meal even to the\r\nhalf-starved, but which taxed the ingenuity of the women to cook in any\r\nway. They were finally made into what Gerald called a Meg Merrilies\r\nstew, which was cooked in a very large mussel-shell, and even without\r\nsalt or vegetables was fully enjoyed by the dissatisfied fish-eaters.\r\n\r\nThen they all sat down earnestly to make a complete stock of bows and\r\narrows; even Baldabella worked hard in twisting the bark for strings,\r\nand when they set out to continue their journey, they felt more\r\nconfidence, for they were now provided with the means of obtaining food,\r\nand of defending themselves against hostile attacks; and in another day\r\nthey again met with wild oats, and, to the joy of the women, with the\r\ntea-bush. The fig-trees no longer bore fruit, but they were still\r\ncovered with their usual inhabitants, flocks of brilliant pigeons,\r\nchattering cockatoos, and the satin-bird, distinguished by its flossy\r\nplumage and dazzling bright eye. Occasionally they still met with the\r\ncucumber melon, a pleasant refreshment when they were weary; and now,\r\nstrong in hope, they went on their way, still keeping within sight of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n\"Every hour must bring us nearer to some of the most remote settlements\r\nof enterprising squatters,\" said Margaret, as they rested beneath a\r\nfig-tree one evening; \"and all our trials would be forgotten if we could\r\nonce more feel the blessing of a roof over our heads and hear the\r\nlanguage of civilized life.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be a gay bit yet afore we come on 'em, Miss,\" said Wilkins.\r\n\"Folks is not such fools as to squat on bare commons; and there's\r\nanother thing ye'll find,--we'se meet a few more of them black dogs yet,\r\nspecially if we come on a bit of good land; they're up to that as well\r\nas we are. And now, as things look a bit better, I'd not wonder if\r\nthey're nigh at hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, Wilkins,\" said Arthur. \"We are now certainly in\r\ndanger of encountering tribes of natives, especially as we are on the\r\ntrack of the kangaroos, a great temptation to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could see one of the mountebank beasts,\" said Gerald;\r\n\"wouldn't I send an arrow or a spear into him. Take notice, all of you,\r\nI intend to bag the first old fellow that shows his long nose.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden spring from a thicket behind them brought a large kangaroo into\r\nthe midst of the circle, and before they had recovered the surprise\r\nsufficiently to take up bows or spears, a succession of rapid bounds had\r\ncarried the animal completely beyond their reach.\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter from his friends somewhat disconcerted O'Brien, but\r\nwith his usual good-humor he said, \"Very well; I allow you to laugh\r\nto-night. The fellow took an unfair advantage of me; but wait till\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nA Seasonable Supply.--Visitors in the Night.--Captivity.--An Old\r\nAcquaintance.--The Ranger's Settlement.--An Embassy to Daisy\r\nGrange.--Jack in a New Office.--The Grateful Native Woman.--Davy's\r\nCompunction.--Bush-ranging Life.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, when the broiled fish was ready for breakfast, Gerald and\r\nHugh were missing. With some uneasiness the rest watched and waited for\r\nan hour, when a shout announced the approach of the wanderers, and\r\nArthur and Jack set out to meet them, and were glad to assist them in\r\ndragging in a kangaroo.\r\n\r\n\"It is the same impudent fellow that defied me last night,\" said Gerald.\r\n\"I tracked his curious boundings to a wood three miles from here; and\r\nthen Hugh and I beat the bushes and shouted till we drove him out of\r\ncover; but he cost us lots of arrows and spears before we could dispatch\r\nhim; and a weighty drag he has been for us this winter morning of June,\r\nwhen the sun is as hot as it is in our summer June at home. Now,\r\nWilkins, help to skin him; we mean to have all our boots mended with his\r\nhide.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Arthur, we must tell you,\" said Hugh, \"that when we were in the\r\nwood we saw a smoke at a considerable distance to the south-west. Do you\r\nthink it could possibly be from some station? Gerald wished much to go\r\non and ascertain whence it arose, but I persuaded him to wait till we\r\nconsulted you; besides, I knew you would be all uneasy if we were long\r\nabsent. Have we got so near the squatters, Wilkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of chance on 't, Master Hugh,\" replied he. \"We're far enough\r\nfrom t' squatters yet. Depend on 't it's just another lot of them\r\ngood-to-nought black rogues. They'll be thick enough here where there's\r\naught to get, I'se warrant 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is most natural and just, Wilkins,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"that the true\r\nproprietors of the soil should participate in its fruits. I fear it is\r\nwe who are, in fact, the rogues, robbing the wretched aborigines of\r\ntheir game, and grudging them even a settlement in their own land.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have not robbed them, papa,\" said Hugh. \"Kangaroos and pigeons\r\nabound here enough for all; and we do not wish to hurt the poor wretches\r\nif they would not annoy us. Here is Margaret quite ready to open a\r\nschool for them, if they would come and be taught.\"\r\n\r\n\"Margaret has done more good than any of us,\" said Mr. Mayburn; \"she has\r\nlabored incessantly to instruct Baldabella and her child, and to open to\r\nthem the way of salvation. It is thus by scattered seeds that the great\r\nwork of diffusing the truth is to be accomplished; and I fear, Hugh, we\r\nhave been too much engrossed with the cares of this life to think\r\nseriously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys,\" said Arthur, \"we had better not linger; the kangaroo is\r\nskinned, and the meat is cut up into convenient portions for carriage;\r\nlet us walk on briskly till we are hungry enough to enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\nOnward they moved over the extensive grassy plains, recognizing with\r\npleasure various tall trees of the varieties of _Eucalyptus_, the\r\nGrass-tree with its long weeping branches, the Pandanus with its\r\nslender palm-like stem, and the Fig-tree with its spreading roots.\r\nBeneath one of these trees they encamped to cook kangaroo steaks, and to\r\nenjoy once more what Wilkins called \"a decent, nat'ral dinner.\" There,\r\nwith strips of skin for thread and a fish-bone for a needle, Wilkins\r\nrepaired the worn and tattered boots, while Margaret and Baldabella made\r\nnetted bags of the stringy bark, and Jenny and Ruth bruised the wild\r\noats which the young men had cut down as they came along.\r\n\r\n\"The rest of the skin I mean to make into a bag,\" said Jack; \"for we\r\nmust carry with us a good stock of oats; we may, probably, again come to\r\nsome spot where they are not to be found.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn looked with pleasure on the busy hands round him; and though\r\nhe deeply regretted the irreparable loss of his books, wasted on the\r\nplundering savages, his composed mind soon submitted to the trial. His\r\nretentive memory supplied the place of books, and, from the rich\r\ntreasures of his reading he delighted to repeat to his attentive\r\nlisteners pleasant and instructive lectures. Cheered and invigorated by\r\nlabor and amusing conversation, the united party forgot all their cares,\r\noffered up their devotions with calm and happy hopes, and slept among\r\nthe sheltering roots of the fig-tree without fear.\r\n\r\nSome unaccustomed sounds suddenly roused the sleepers, and they looked\r\nround to behold through the dim light of breaking day the grim visages\r\nof a numerous band of tall savages, with rough heads and beards, who\r\nwere armed with spears, and who looked on their surprised captives with\r\na sort of scornful indifference, as they beckoned them to rise and\r\nfollow them. Hugh and Gerald sprung up to seize their spears and bows,\r\nbut Arthur, with more prudence, ordered them to forbear making any\r\nhostile demonstration. \"We are in the power of these strangers,\" he\r\nsaid; \"our only hope must be in conciliation and treaty. I will try to\r\nmake the best of it.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to the native who stood nearest to him, he endeavored, in\r\nthe few words he had learnt from Baldabella, to make him understand\r\ntheir poverty and inoffensive disposition, and their desire to be\r\npermitted to proceed on their journey. The man looked round, as if to\r\ncall on another to reply, and, to the astonishment of Arthur, a voice\r\nfrom the crowd answered in English.\r\n\r\n\"We are open to a fair reg'lar treatise, young man, Perdoose yer swag,\r\nwhich is the vulgar country word for what we English terminate _tin_,\r\nand then we will sign your disfranchisement.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice and the extraordinary phraseology were familiar to the\r\nMayburns, and Hugh cried out, \"What, Bill, is that you? How came you\r\nhere? Is David Simple with you? and where is Mr. Deverell?\"\r\n\r\nThe man, who had now come forward, dressed in the remnants of his\r\nformerly seedy foppery, looked annoyed at the recognition. He stared\r\nimpudently at Hugh, and said, \"You have mistaken your man, young master.\r\nI have no convalescence of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in vain for you to affect ignorance of us, Bill,\" said Arthur;\r\n\"we know you to be a ticket-of-leave man, engaged as a servant at\r\nMelbourne by Mr. Deverell. I am grieved to find you in such unsuitable\r\ncompany, and would advise you to join us, and guide us to your master's\r\nstation, where we shall be able to reward you liberally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the man, laughing scornfully; \"but Mr. Deverell\r\nand I did not part good friends, and I have no innovation to visit him\r\nagain. His ways is percoolar, and a gentleman as has had a deliberate\r\neddication looks higher nor waiting on cattle; so Davy and I came to a\r\ndissolution to abrogate the place, and set out on a predestinarian\r\nexcrescence.\"\r\n\r\n\"He means, master,\" said Davy, with a downcast look, interpreting his\r\nbrother's difficult language; \"he means as how we took to t' bush. I was\r\nbad to win round to 't; but Bill, he'd collogued with a lot of black\r\nfellows, and had 'em all in a wood hard again our boundaries; and they\r\nthranged me round, and threaped as how they'd cut my throat if I stayed\r\nafter them to peach; and, graceless dog as I were, I joined 'em to drive\r\nour best stock, when we knew as how master was off for a week. It were a\r\nsore day's work, and little good do I see in living among a set of\r\nraggles like them. I warn ye, master, if ye've gotten any cash about ye,\r\njust pay 't down, and make no words about it, afore they get aggravated,\r\nfor they're a bloody set, that are they.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my poor mistaken man,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"what in the world can\r\nthese savages do with money in this houseless wilderness?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's our affair,\" answered Bill. \"So open your bank, old fellow, and\r\nleave it to intelligible fellows like me to transact your gold into\r\nbrandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, Bill,\" replied Arthur, \"I think it is my duty to\r\nremind you of the fatal consequences of highway robbery, and to beseech\r\nyou to return to your duty, and endeavor to retrieve your error. In the\r\nnext place, you cannot possibly benefit by your extortion, for we are\r\nliterally and truly without money. We have letters of credit on\r\nCalcutta, and we could certainly obtain money at Melbourne, but only by\r\nour personal application at that place. We have been already stripped by\r\none of the black tribes, of every article of property we possessed, and\r\nwe are now wholly destitute. This is the exact truth. Now I suggest to\r\nyou that your wisest plan would be to leave us to pursue our way\r\nunmolested; unless you or your misguided brother will accompany us to\r\nthe settlement of Mr. Deverell, with whom, I think, we have sufficient\r\ninfluence to induce him to pardon your offence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who would be the fools then?\" answered the man. \"No, sir, your oratorio\r\nmakes no depression on me. If you haven't got money, you're worth money.\r\nYou must march in the arrear of your captivators to our quarters. You\r\nshall then write a letter, which I shall dedicate to you. I never travel\r\nwithout my writing impediments; and one of my 'cute black fellows, as is\r\nconservant in English, shall be dispersed away to your friend Mr.\r\nDeverell, who must confiscate to me cash or stuff for your ransom; and\r\nwhen I see my brandy and cigars, you are disfranchised.\"\r\n\r\nIt was useless to attempt opposition to the mandates of the imperious\r\nand conceited bush-ranger, and the disconsolate captives reluctantly\r\nfollowed the man, surrounded by such a troop of natives as precluded all\r\nhopes of escape, and exposed to the insults and plunder of these\r\nsavages, who wrested from them their spears and bows. Wilkins had\r\ncontrived to secret his knife under his vest, and thus saved it. They\r\nhad not proceeded far before they were joined by a band of women,\r\nrevolting in appearance and manner, who crowded round them, rudely\r\nexamined their garments, and freely possessed themselves of such as they\r\ncould conveniently snatch away. Margaret looked round for Baldabella to\r\nassist her in remonstrating with these harpies, and was surprised to see\r\nthat she had disappeared.\r\n\r\nMargaret then remembered that, on the previous night, the woman had\r\nselected a thicket considerably apart from the rest, as a sleeping-place\r\nfor herself and her child, and she concluded that at the first alarm of\r\nthe invaders, the poor woman had escaped, her dread of her\r\nfellow-countrymen overcoming even her allegiance to her friends. After\r\nall, Margaret considered it was as well; there were two less to be\r\nanxious for, and she had no fears for the native on her own soil: she\r\nwould certainly find food, and would probably wait and watch for the\r\nrelease of the captives.\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant march of the prisoners extended to nearly three miles;\r\nthen, descending a low hill, they arrived at a lovely wooded valley,\r\nwhere, on the banks of a little creek, or streamlet, stood a number of\r\nrough bark huts. A herd of cattle were feeding on the grassy plain, and\r\nsome horses, hobbled, to prevent them straying, were mingled with them.\r\nNaked children were rolling on the grass, shouting and laughing; women\r\nwere busy bruising nuts, or making nets; and some aged men were seated\r\nin the sun with their knees raised to their heads, looking stupid and\r\nhalf dead.\r\n\r\nIt was the first scene of pastoral life that the travellers had beheld\r\nin Australia, and would have had a certain charm to them had they been\r\nin a position to enjoy it. But the thoughts of their captivity\r\nengrossed their minds, and they contemplated with uneasiness the fierce\r\nand threatening countenances of the lawless men who surrounded them, and\r\nwho drove them forward like the cattle they had so villainously\r\nobtained, and lodged them in a large bark hut which stood at the\r\nextremity of the scattered hamlet. This rude shelter was wholly open in\r\nfront, and filthily dirty inside; but they were thankful for any shelter\r\nthat divided them from the coarse and abandoned robbers; and, flinging\r\nthemselves on the ground, the disconsolate captives reflected silently\r\non their perilous situation, while their captors, assembled before the\r\nrude prison, seemed earnestly discussing, as Arthur concluded, the means\r\nof making the most profit of their destitute prisoners.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes had elapsed, they were favored with a visit from the\r\naudacious and ignorant convict Bill, who addressed them with his usual\r\npompous air, saying,--\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, we have dissented on dispersing one of your gang along with\r\nour embarrasser to Deverell, that he may be incensed into the right of\r\nthe thing. We set you up as worth a hundred pound, hard cash, for the\r\nlot; but if we concentrate to take stuff, we shall exhort two hundred.\r\nThings is bad to sell in the bush. We expectorate a chap in a day or two\r\nas is intentionable to buy our stock, and then you must keep close\r\nquarters, for when my colloquies get their brandy they are always a bit\r\numbrageous.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Mayburn comprehended the meaning of this elaborate nonsense, he\r\ndeclared positively that he would not allow one of his children to\r\ndepart on such an unjust errand, accompanied by an abandoned reprobate.\r\n\r\n\"I should like nothing better than to start off on such a trip,\" said\r\nGerald. \"What a surprise it would be at Daisy Grange when they saw my\r\nbrown face; and wouldn't pretty Emma say, with tears in her eyes, 'Oh,\r\nGerald! what has become of Arthur?' And grave Edward Deverell would fall\r\ninto heaps of confusion, and say, 'Margaret! why is not Margaret with\r\nyou?'\"\r\n\r\nArthur laughed, but shook his head, and refused to abet any plan of\r\nsubjecting the thoughtless boy to such risk.\r\n\r\n\"But might not Wilkins go?\" asked Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"Not I, thank ye, Master Hugh,\" answered the man, hastily; \"we'd like\r\nenough fall in with some of them hot-headed black pollis when we got\r\nnigh to t' station, and they're all so set up wi' their guns, that afore\r\nI could get out a word they'd sure to pick me out for a runaway, and\r\nshoot me dead; and, more nor that, I'll not say if I were let loose\r\namong them care-nought rangers, as I mightn't fall into their ways, and\r\ntake to t' bush like 'em; and then, ye see, all yer good work would be\r\nflung away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilkins might be useful to you here, Master Arthur,\" said Jack; \"but I\r\ndon't see why I shouldn't go. I'm no ways feared; and I could put Mr.\r\nDeverell up to getting hold of these vagabonds and their own cattle; and\r\nthen, you know, sir, I should find timber and tools enough, and I could\r\nsoon knock up a bit of a wagon to bring up for Miss Margaret and the\r\nmaster, and the other poor things. What think you, sir, about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must confess, papa,\" said Arthur, \"that I feel satisfied that Jack is\r\nthe right man. But can we make up our minds to part with our tried and\r\nfaithful friend? I leave it to you to decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear son,\" answered Mr. Mayburn, much agitated, \"I cannot decide\r\nsuch an important question. Only consider; should his savage companion\r\nprove treacherous, our dear Jack may be sacrificed, and his blood fall\r\non our heads. I shrink from the responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, dear papa,\" said Margaret, weeping bitterly, \"I fear we\r\nmust consent. Jack will be accompanied by only one man, whose policy it\r\nwill be to be careful of his life till the transaction be completed. On\r\nhis return, rely on it, Edward Deverell will take care he has arms and\r\nprotection. Jack is sagacious, brave, and prudent. I grieve to part with\r\nhim; but I believe it may be for the benefit of all. We must resign him,\r\nand pray for God's blessing on our brave deliverer.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I say, Jack, my man,\" said Wilkins, \"if ye should chance to light\r\non a bonnie bit lass, called Susan Raine, down yonder, just ye say as\r\nhow Wilkins is not altogether that graceless she counts him. He's bad\r\nenough, God knows; but he oft thinks on days of lang syne; and he's\r\ntrue, tell her, come what may.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then communicated to the vile dictator of the dark band that a\r\nmessenger was ready to set out to procure the ransom from Mr. Deverell;\r\nand the next day, amidst the loud sobs of Ruth and the silent grief of\r\nthe rest, Jack took leave, and set forward towards the south,\r\naccompanied by a tall, crafty-looking savage, who had evidently been\r\naccustomed to traffic with the bush-rangers, and had acquired sufficient\r\nEnglish to serve his purpose. One of their ablest defenders was thus\r\nsevered from the unfortunate captives, who hourly became more alarmed\r\nabout their position. Forbidden to leave the hut, they were merely fed,\r\nlike the dogs, with the disgusting remains of the untempting food of\r\ntheir savage captors; and but for the secret good offices of Davy, they\r\nmust have perished of thirst. He brought them every night a bark bucket\r\nof water from the creek, which saved their lives.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Mayburn and Margaret, who could not touch the decomposed fish\r\nand gnawed bones that were thrown to them, gradually sunk into a state\r\nof weakness that distracted their helpless friends. Four days elapsed\r\nafter Jack's departure, and Margaret was reclining, weak and weary, yet\r\nunable to sleep, against the back wall of the hut, when about midnight,\r\nshe was startled by a scratching sound outside the bark. Much alarmed,\r\nbut too weak to move, she trembled, and feebly called to Jenny, who was\r\nsleeping near her. But just at that moment the low, sweet voice of\r\nBaldabella greeted her, through an opening made in the bark near the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"Missee, good dear missee!\" murmured the woman; \"Baldabella see all,\r\nlook in all _gunyoes_. Baldabella come, all sleep now; bring bread,\r\nbring fish for missee and good master.\"\r\n\r\nThen through the opening Jenny received cakes of pounded oats, such as\r\nshe herself had taught Baldabella to make, broiled fish, and a bark\r\nvessel filled with hot tea, a plentiful and luxurious repast. When she\r\nhad given up her store, the grateful woman whispered, \"Baldabella go\r\nmake more bread, come again dark night. Pray God bless white friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe prayer of Baldabella was gratefully acknowledged and responded to by\r\nher much affected friends, who blessed the hour they were so happy as to\r\nsnatch the poor widow from the death which hung over her body and soul,\r\nand to win her affections and sympathy. Invigorated by the wholesome and\r\nclean food, Mr. Mayburn and Margaret again began to hope for better\r\ndays, and to plan their pleasant journey south.\r\n\r\nFor three nights Baldabella returned with her abundant and seasonable\r\ngifts; while the sordid wretch who detained them, plainly cared only for\r\nthe ransom he hoped to obtain for them. But Davy continued to steal in\r\nevery night with the welcome supply of fresh water, and remained to\r\nlisten to their prayers and hymns, with a softened and mournful\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"Ye see, sir,\" said the poor fellow to Arthur, \"our Bill, he's up to all\r\nsorts of things; he's had a grand eddication, and knows reet fra' wrong\r\nbetter nor me; and he orders me, like, and I cannot say him nay; he\r\nreckons I'se but a simple chap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever learn your Catechism, Davy?\" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"They did get that into me, Miss,\" answered he, \"and little good it's\r\ndone me. I niver like to think on 't nowadays; it's just awesome, it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not steal!\" said Mr. Mayburn, emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"Please, master, not to talk on't,\" said the agitated young man; \"it's\r\nabout them beasts as ye're meaning on. But our Bill says, says he, 'It\r\nstands to reason as them as has ower mony ought to sarve them as has\r\nnone.' Now what think ye of that, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think and know, David,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"that it is God's will that\r\nall men should obey His commandments, and do their duty in the station\r\nwhere He has placed them. You had no more right to take Mr. Deverell's\r\ncattle than these poor savages have to strip you naked and leave you to\r\ndie alone in the desert, and in the eyes of God you are more guilty than\r\nthey would be, for you have been taught His law. You know that God has\r\nsaid that the thief shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. Now, David,\r\ndeath is near to us all, young or old: think what will be your dreadful\r\nfate when you wake in another world, forsaken by God. Then turn to Him\r\nnow, while there is yet time, and pray for repentance and pardon through\r\nthe blessed Saviour, that your sins may be forgiven, and you may be\r\nbrought to dwell with him forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, master, I can tell ye if 't were to do again,\" answered the man,\r\n\"Bill s'ould niver talk me ower to put my hands to t' job. And, after\r\nall, a poor set we've made on 't. Ye see, this is how we did it; we\r\ndarked and kept quiet till t' master was off down t' country, then we\r\nmarked off our beasts, and picked out our saddle-horses, and a gun\r\na-piece. I ought to have had warning plenty about me'ling wi' a gun.\r\nThen off we set at midnight, driving our beasts and a flock of sheep,\r\nand were soon up till them black fellows as was watin' us. First we\r\ndruv' our sheep till a bush public, where a sly auld hand took 'em, and\r\ngave us a lot of bad brandy and worse tobacco for 'em, and sin' that\r\nwe've run and rode about t' country, up and down, hereaway and\r\nthereaway, like wild beasts. Then we're feared of t' pollis, and we're\r\nfeared of all ther' black fellows, as can turn rusty when they like, and\r\nit's nought but drinking, cursing, and fighting all day long, brutes as\r\nwe are. I'se fairly tired, master, and I'd fain be back among\r\nChristians; but then, I'd niver be t' fellow to peach; and, ower that, I\r\nknow there's a rope round my neck, as is sartain to be tightened if I\r\nshow my face at our station again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nA Proposal of Marriage.--Bill's Rejection and\r\nRevenge.--Pocket-picking.--Jack's Return.--Black Peter again.--Bush\r\nranging Merriment.--A Flight in the Dark.--An Emu-chase.--The\r\ndisappointed Hunters.--Pursuit.--A Stratagem.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple Davy, the whole family believed, would not prove irreclaimable,\r\nand they used every persuasion to bring the poor man to a knowledge of\r\nhis faults, and to a desire to reform them; but his blind submission to\r\nhis \"_eddicated_\" brother proved a formidable obstacle, till his heart\r\nbecame enlightened by the truths of religion. The cunning villain Bill\r\nwas a great annoyance to the family: he continually visited them, and\r\nhis absurd speeches no longer afforded them amusement, for he had now\r\nsignified his intention of becoming a candidate for the hand of\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\n\"Not that Miss would aggress,\" said the convict, \"to live with these low\r\n_ignis fatuus_ men, that we eddicated men terminate flea-beings, seeing\r\nshe is not customary to their ways. But you see, Miss, I preponderate\r\nsetting up a bush tavern, quite illimitable to the beat of the imperious\r\npollis; quite a genteel hottle, where you might prorogue like a lady,\r\nand I'd not reject to adapt these lads, and give them a job at waiting;\r\nand we might revive an opening for the old governor, if you mattered\r\nhaving him.\"\r\n\r\nHugh and Gerald would have seized the impudent rascal and flung him out\r\nof the hut, but Arthur restrained them, and arresting his father's\r\nindignant remonstrance, he said, \"Bill, my sister must never again hear\r\nsuch absurd and offensive language; she is too young even to think of\r\nsuch things, and quite unfitted by education and religion for mingling\r\nwith lawless bush-rangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that, young fellow,\" answered Bill with a diabolical\r\ngrin. \"You might have permeated the young woman to speak for herself;\r\nshe's old enough to be deciduous. But wait a bit till I touch your\r\nransom, and then we'll considerate about her. She was not secluded in my\r\nbargain, and you'll find as how I'm empirical here.\"\r\n\r\nThe terror and distress of Margaret were very great, and but for the\r\nabsence of Jack, who was always ingenious in affairs of difficulty,\r\nArthur would have yielded to her wish, and attempted their escape, which\r\nby the aid of Baldabella in the out-works, and of David, who was much\r\nashamed of his brother's audacious proposal, in the citadel, they did\r\nnot think would be extremely difficult. The bark hut which was their\r\nprison, was situated at the extremity of the range of huts, and close to\r\na thick wood, from which Baldabella made her nightly visits without\r\ndisturbance. David had supplied the young men with some sheets of bark\r\nto partition off the back part of the hut for Margaret and her servants,\r\nand from this apartment it would be easy to cut open the bark, and\r\nescape into the wood, the savages usually sleeping on the ground before\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\nStill, unless they were driven to extremities, they desired to defer\r\ntheir flight till the return of Jack, as, besides the hope that he might\r\nbring them efficient aid from Mr. Deverell, they did not wish to abandon\r\nhim to the wrath of the disappointed rangers; but they explained their\r\nintention to Baldabella, and begged her to be prepared; and they hoped\r\nthat they were prevailing on David to become their companion and guide.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed in the same dreary and distressing seclusion. If any\r\nof the prisoners ventured to breathe the air outside the hut, they were\r\nassailed with rude language, pelted and insulted by the rangers or the\r\nblacks. Jenny and Ruth had gone out to cut some grass to spread over the\r\nground on which they slept, and were seized by the women, their clothes\r\ntorn, their hair pulled, and the contents of their pockets discovered\r\nand torn from them.\r\n\r\n\"Ragged I am, and ragged I may be, now,\" said Jenny. \"I wonder what good\r\nmy bit housewife will do them ondecent hussies; and neither thread,\r\nneedle, nor scissors have I left. And Miss Marget, my honey, there was\r\nmy silver thimble that you bought me in London, and my prayer-book from\r\nMaster Arthur,--God bless him!--and my spectacles that master gave me;\r\nbut that's little matter, I don't need them when I've nothing left to\r\nread or sew.\"\r\n\r\nRuth sobbed out incoherently, \"My bonnie purse; oh dear! oh dear! and my\r\ntwo shillings, and my lucky crook't sixpence, and my Sunday ribbons and\r\ncotton gloves, and my bonnie little Testament! Oh dear! where's I to get\r\nmair?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn consoled the women, and showed them his pocket Bible, which\r\nhe had still preserved, and from which he could daily read to them the\r\nwords of comfort and hope; and Margaret encouraged Jenny with the\r\nprospect of one day reaching Daisy Grange, when she felt assured that\r\nthe orderly and prudent Mrs. Deverell would have needles and thread to\r\nbestow on them.\r\n\r\nOne evening some very unusual sounds tempted Gerald who was always\r\nrestless in his confinement, to steal out of the hut. He was absent some\r\ntime, and Arthur had become very uneasy lest he should have been\r\narrested and punished for this disobedience of orders, when, with a face\r\nfull of news, he rushed back into the hut, exclaiming, \"Jack is brought\r\nback! there are three or four more of those ugly convicts; and, oh,\r\nArthur, there is Black Peter amongst them!\"\r\n\r\nThis was really melancholy news, and Mr. Mayburn in deep distress looked\r\nappealingly to Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Margaret must be taken away,\" he said; \"I cannot have her remain among\r\nthese reprobates. Then there is Wilkins, poor fellow! That wicked wretch\r\nhas ever persecuted and hated him; he is not safe with us; we must care\r\nfor him, and send him away. But ought we not all to depart? I feel that\r\nI am unable to judge the matter calmly; decide for us, my son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be better able to do that, papa,\" answered Arthur, \"when I\r\nlearn what extraordinary circumstance has induced Jack to return. It is\r\nquite impossible that he can have executed his mission; and I cannot\r\nimagine that these robbers have relinquished their desire for the\r\nransom-money. I am very anxious to see him.\"\r\n\r\nThe sounds of riot and discord were now heard through the hamlet; the\r\nprisoners concluded that more brandy had been brought in, and it was\r\nproducing its usual delusive and fatal effects among men and women. The\r\nintoxication proceeded to madness; horrid oaths and blasphemy were the\r\nonly words to be distinguished; first uttered by the white man,\r\nerroneously named a Christian, and then eagerly imitated by his heathen\r\nbrother. In the midst of the confusion, Jack stole in unnoticed by the\r\nsavages to his anxious friends. He was pale with fatigue,\r\ndisappointment, and alarm; for he saw that the frenzy of the intoxicated\r\nwretches might at any moment lead them to murder.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Arthur,\" said he, hurriedly, \"I have got hold of a gun and a few\r\ncharges, and David will follow me here with another, as soon as the\r\nfellows drink themselves into stupor; then we must make off without\r\ndelay, or we are lost. Black Peter has determined to have his own way,\r\nand you know what his way is; and depend on it, if he had not been led\r\noff with the brandy, he would have been here to bully and threaten\r\nbefore now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! alas!\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"how did it happen, my good lad, that\r\nyou fell into the hands of that abandoned man?\"\r\n\r\n\"We met him on our way, sir,\" answered Jack, \"mounted on a handsome\r\nhorse that he'd stolen from somebody's station; he was dressed like a\r\ngentleman, and three more fellows, all bush-rangers, I'll be bound, were\r\nalong with him, well mounted too. They were carrying kegs of liquor and\r\nbales of tobacco to barter for the stolen cattle, which they mean to\r\ndrive down the country to sell. Peter knew me as soon as he set eyes on\r\nme, and hailed me to know what had become of my comrades. Then the sulky\r\nblack fellow that rode with me took on him to tell, in his lingo, what\r\nwe were after. It would have made your blood run cold, master, to hear\r\nhow that brute Peter cursed Bill; he said he was nought but a poor,\r\npitiful, long-tongued fool, to swap such a prize for a hundred pounds;\r\nand he swore he would have ten times as much for the bargain, and have\r\nit for himself too. 'I've got shot of my cowardly troop, ye see,' he\r\nsaid to my guide; 'they didn't suit me; they ran away at the sight of\r\nblood. I'll see now if I can't put that set-up fellow, Bill, down a peg,\r\nand manage your folks a bit better, blackey.' Then he went back to his\r\nwhite colleagues, and said, 'You might make a penny of these two\r\nrunaways; there's money on their heads; what say ye to carrying them\r\noff?'\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell how they settled their treacherous plan; but as they had\r\narms, they forced us to turn back with them; and Bill looked so cowed\r\nwhen he saw Black Peter, that I make no doubt the craftier rogue of the\r\ntwo will be master by to-morrow; and there will be a poor chance for us,\r\nif we do not overreach him to-night. Well, Davy, how are they getting\r\non?\" he added, as the simple fellow entered cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"They'll not be lang fit for wark,\" answered he. \"Some's down now, and\r\nBill and Peter had come to fighting; but them new chaps, as corned with\r\nyou, parted 'em; and I seed 'em wink at Peter, and they said as how it\r\ncould be settled to-morrow. But it would hardly be safe to stop for\r\nthat; and if ye're ready and willing, I'se get ye off cannily afther\r\nit's dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are willing and ready, David,\" said Arthur, \"and most thankful to\r\nhave you for our guide. I will engage that Mr. Deverell will pardon and\r\nprotect you, if we are fortunate enough to reach Daisy Grange; but how\r\nmy father and sister are to accomplish the journey, I cannot think.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all pat, sir; see to me for that,\" answered David. \"Not a chap\r\namang 'em was fit to hobble t' horses but me, I had it all my own way,\r\nand I brought our two, and their four, all round to t' back of this here\r\nwood, and tied 'm up ready saddled. Afore midnight, light on me to be\r\nthere, and all fettled and ready. I'se get Baldabella to warn ye at t'\r\nreet minute, and then ye can make yer way out backwards, and she'll\r\nbring ye through t' wood, and we'se get a good start afore day-leet.\r\nThey've no more horses fit for t' saddle, if they were fit themselves;\r\nbut it will be a fair bit afore they sleep off their drunken fit.\"\r\n\r\nThe yells and screams of the mad drunkards grew louder and more\r\ndiscordant, and the trembling women clung fearfully to each other in the\r\nback apartment of the hut, where they had already cut an opening large\r\nenough to allow them to escape; but they were anxious to defer the\r\nattempt till Davy thought the moment favorable. At length they heard the\r\noaths and curses muttered in fainter tones; and, one after another, the\r\nvoices died away. Gladly the anxious captives marked the deep silence\r\nthat succeeded, which was finally broken by David whispering through the\r\nopening behind the hut,--\r\n\r\n\"Come along; be sharp, and tread soft. There's a lot of chaps lying\r\nafore t' hut: ye cannot come out that way. Mind ye dinnot waken 'em.\r\nHere's Baldabella; she'll trail ye through t' bush, and I'll on afore,\r\nand make ready.\"\r\n\r\nTrembling and breathless, one after another they followed Baldabella,\r\nforcing their way through the thick underwood, scarcely conscious of\r\nbruises, scratches, and rent garments, till, by the faint light of the\r\nmoon through a gathering mist, they saw David holding the harnessed\r\nhorses outside the tangled wood.\r\n\r\n\"Manage as ye like,\" said he; \"there's twelve on us, reckoning t' babby,\r\nbut some on ye is leet weights.\"\r\n\r\nBaldabella refused to mount, and, giving her child to Wilkins, she\r\nwalked on; and so light and swift was her pace, that she kept up well\r\nwith the doubly-laden horses, though they proceeded as speedily as they\r\ncould over the grassy plains. For six hours they continued to travel due\r\nsouth, silently and uninterruptedly; then the morning light cheered\r\ntheir spirits, they realized the fact of their freedom, and they\r\nrejoiced as they rested on a rich plain while the horses fed, and lifted\r\nup their voices in praise and thanksgiving that they were once more free\r\nin a savage land; and even poor David, with tears of penitence, united\r\nhumbly with them in prayer.\r\n\r\nAll the party needed the refreshment they knew not where to seek, when\r\nBaldabella produced a netted bag of cakes and nuts, with which they were\r\nobliged to content themselves; and hoping that they might meet with\r\nwater before they were again compelled to rest, they set forward with\r\ngratitude and cheerfulness. But they were somewhat disheartened as they\r\nproceeded; for though herbage and trees were plentiful, water was rarely\r\nto be met with. Hollows in the earth, which contained a muddy remnant of\r\nthe well-filled pools of the rainy season, were their sole dependence--a\r\nscanty and unpleasant supply. They had long ago lost sight of the river,\r\nfrom which they had designedly diverged in order to mislead their\r\npursuers, leaving it on their left hand. Fig-trees were common on the\r\nplains, but no longer bearing fruit; still, they continued to be\r\nfrequented by the cockatoos and pigeons, and having made bows and\r\narrows, they procured as many as they wished for food.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day, Baldabella, who was before them, summoned them by the\r\nwelcome cry, \"_Yarrai! yarrai!_--water! water!\" and they saw a narrow\r\nfull streamlet, rushing to the south-east, probably to swell some large\r\nriver; a consideration very tempting to the travellers, who could not\r\nventure on the direct track which David was acquainted with, lest they\r\nshould be overtaken. They resolved, therefore, to continue by the water,\r\nso necessary to preserve their own strength and that of their horses;\r\nand though the approach towards a large river might place them amongst\r\nthe black tribes again, they would still be on the highway which led to\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThey now selected their resting-places close by the refreshing stream,\r\nand without adventure, till it happened that one day they had indulged\r\nfor some hours in a noonday repose under the shelter of some trees. Then\r\nthe young men set out to beat the wood for birds; but Gerald soon cried\r\nout, \"To horse! to horse! bold hunters. Emus are in view!\" and, on\r\nskirting the wood, the whole family had a view of a flock of those huge\r\nbirds, at some distance on the plain, grazing with all the tranquillity\r\nof domestic cattle.\r\n\r\n\"We are not in want of emus, Gerald,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"These creatures\r\nare as free to live as we are ourselves. Why will men become hunters\r\nfrom mere wantonness?\"\r\n\r\n\"We could do cannily with one, master,\" said Jenny. \"They're fair good\r\neating, and ye see, sir, great strong men gets tired of these bits of\r\nbirds.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn sighed at the necessity of disturbing the peace of the happy\r\ncreatures, and duly impressed on Arthur his wish that only one bird\r\nshould be killed. All the young men, roused at the thoughts of the\r\nchase, sprang upon their horses, and, armed with spears and bows,\r\ngalloped off to the field. Crafty and swift as these birds are, they\r\nwere not entirely able to elude their mounted enemies, who attacked them\r\nwith spears and arrows, and at last succeeded in separating from the\r\nrest and surrounding one large bird, in which several arrows had been\r\npreviously lodged. Infuriated with pain and fright, the bird ran\r\nfrantically round the circle, in fruitless endeavors to escape between\r\nthe horses; and Gerald, piercing it with his long spear to oppose its\r\nretreat, it turned suddenly round, and, striking out backwards with its\r\npowerful leg, inflicted such a blow on the horse he was riding, that it\r\nstaggered and fell.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at the accident, the hunters all rode up to assist Gerald; and\r\nthe wounded emu profited by the opportunity, and effected a retreat to\r\nits companions, to the great vexation of the sanguine young men. They\r\nsoon raised the horse and his rider. Gerald had escaped unhurt; but the\r\nhorse was so bruised by the kick of the powerful creature, that Arthur\r\nsaw with consternation that their journey must be delayed some time,\r\ntill it recovered from the blow; if, indeed, it was not rendered\r\nentirely incapable of further service.\r\n\r\nMortified and dejected, the discomfited hunters returned to the\r\nencampment, where they were received by Mr. Mayburn with a lesson on\r\nhumanity to animals, by Margaret with friendly raillery, and by Jenny\r\nwith ill-repressed murmurs; but all were grieved at the sufferings of\r\nthe poor horse.\r\n\r\n\"That beast must just lie where he is for one day, however,\" said\r\nWilkins; \"and I question whether that'll sarve to mend a bad job. I say,\r\nsome of ye slips of lads, run up them trees, and take a look round, to\r\nsee if t' coast's clear.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at once employment and amusement for the active boys, Hugh and\r\nGerald, to climb two tall fig-trees that grew in front of the wood, and\r\nscan the wide scene around.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sentinels,\" cried Margaret from below, \"please to report what you\r\nhave observed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see our little rivulet,\" said Hugh, \"winding like a silver thread\r\nover the plains to the south-east, even to the very horizon, where a\r\ngray line terminates the view. That may be the hem of the large river\r\nArthur has planned.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Arthur, come up,\" cried Gerald; \"I want you to look at a dark\r\nmass far away north. I could almost fancy I saw it moving.\"\r\n\r\nArthur was soon by his side, and, after examining the object pointed\r\nout, he said with a sigh, \"You are right, Gerald, it does move; and I\r\nfear we are pursued at this unlucky moment, when we cannot, I fear,\r\ncontinue our flight. You, boys, remain to watch, while I descend to hold\r\na council about our perilous situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hand us up the guns, then, Arthur,\" answered Gerald, \"and see if we\r\nwill not guard the pass. Not a single rogue shall advance, but we will\r\nmark him and bring him down from our watch-tower.\"\r\n\r\n\"That plan will not do, Gerald,\" said Arthur. \"Your office is to watch,\r\nand, as soon as you can, to ascertain their strength.\"\r\n\r\nThen the distressed youth descended to report his lamentable tidings to\r\nthe tranquil party below, and great was the dismay felt by the timid.\r\n\r\n\"We might send off master and Miss Margaret,\" said Jack. \"What think you\r\nof that, Mr. Arthur? We could hold out here a good bit, to let them have\r\na good start down south; and then, if God helped us, we might get after\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Margaret, what do you say to this plan?\" asked Mr. Mayburn. \"There is\r\nDavy, who seems honest, could we not trust him to conduct us and our two\r\npoor women to our friends the Deverells?\"\r\n\r\n\"It must not be so, dear papa,\" answered Margaret; \"we must live or die\r\ntogether. Think how unhappy we should be to leave them exposed to\r\ndangers for our sakes. But could we not hide in this thick wood? It\r\nmight be that the pursuers would not discover us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the trail, Margaret,\" answered Arthur,--\"the trail would betray us.\r\nIs there any mode left us to escape, do you think, Wilkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, Mr. Arthur, ye fancy it's best to set one rogue to cheat\r\nanother,\" replied Wilkins. \"Keep up your heart, Miss; I'se thinking we\r\ncan lead 'em on a wrong scent yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe wood behind them spread for a considerable way along the side of the\r\nrivulet, from which it was about a hundred yards distant. The opposite\r\nbanks were hemmed up to the water with a broad growth of reeds, beyond\r\nwhich lay a vast entangled scrub.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see if we cannot manage to send 'em ower yonder,\" continued\r\nWilkins, pointing to the opposite side; \"so bring t' horses here, and\r\ncome along wi' ye.\"\r\n\r\nBy the orders of Wilkins the men mounted the five sound horses, having\r\nfirst led the lame one, with Margaret, Mr. Mayburn, and the women, into\r\nthe intricacies of the wood, and left them, carefully arranging the\r\nbush, so that no trail could be seen. Then the horsemen, making a broad\r\ntrack, by riding abreast, proceeded to the shallow rivulet, crossed it,\r\nand breaking down the reeds before them, forced a pass to the scrub.\r\nHere it was unnecessary to proceed, as on the brush-covered ground it\r\nwas easy to suppose the trail might be lost; they therefore returned,\r\ncarefully retracing their steps to the river, and riding the horses in\r\nthe water about a hundred yards down the stream, from which, at distant\r\nintervals, they brought them up singly to the wood, obliterating the\r\ntrail with scrupulous care; and, finally, through several convenient\r\nopenings, they introduced them into the heart of the wood, where a small\r\ngrassy spot enabled them to leave the animals to graze, after carefully\r\nsecuring them. Here all the party assembled, to wait the event, except\r\nthe three boys, who, taking guns and bows, returned to the fig-trees\r\nfrom whence they had first perceived the pursuers, re-ascended, and\r\nconcealed themselves in the thick foliage, to watch the foe, and, if\r\nnecessary, to defend the fortress.\r\n\r\nThe pursuers were now plainly visible, and the watchers discovered that\r\nthe party consisted of the bush-rangers, driving before them a herd of\r\ncattle, and accompanied by a band of the natives. The procession\r\ncertainly formed an imposing body, but the men were on foot, and must\r\nnecessarily proceed slowly with the cattle; and if all the horses had\r\nbeen fit for the road, Arthur saw they might easily have escaped\r\npursuit, and he bitterly regretted the imprudent and unprofitable chase\r\nof the emu. He now considered that the most advisable plan would be, if\r\npossible, to allow the men to pass, and then to follow them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nThe Sentinels in the Trees.--The End of Bill the Convict.--The\r\nBush-rangers deceived.--A strange New Animal.--A Bloody Conflict.--The\r\nMountain-pass.--The Fruit of the Acacia.--The Travellers in\r\nCustody.--The Court of Justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery moment increased the anxiety of the young sentinels, who were\r\nscarcely able to speak for agitation. At last Hugh said,--\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it a capital chance for us, Arthur, that the great drove of\r\ncattle are before the keen-eyed rangers? They will trample down our\r\ntrail effectually.\"\r\n\r\nThis was certainly an advantage to the fugitives, especially as they\r\nremarked the cattle followed the exact track they had made. They were\r\nnow able to distinguish the powerful figure of Black Peter, who was\r\naccompanied by the three strange bush-rangers whom Jack had met with\r\nhim, and followed by about fifty of the natives whom they had seen with\r\nBill the convict. These men were painted white, as if for battle, and\r\nwere armed with spears and boomerangs; but Bill was not with them,--a\r\ncircumstance that gave great satisfaction to Arthur, for the sake of\r\npoor David.\r\n\r\nThe whole body drew up beneath the very trees in which the young men\r\nwere hidden; and whilst the cattle plunged into the river with great\r\nenjoyment, Peter was examining the trail which led to the water, and had\r\nbeen purposely made to mislead them. He then pointed out to his\r\ncompanions the broken reeds on the opposite bank, and after pouring out\r\na volley of curses, he said,--\r\n\r\n\"They've crossed here, and not very long sin', that's clear. We're close\r\nat their heels, and we mustn't bide long dawdling here; and, Jem, see ye\r\nkeep that brandy out of t' way of them black and white bugaboos, or\r\nwe'se have 'em, when their blood's up, knocking out our brains, and we\r\nhaven't a gun left to learn 'em manners with. Let me lay hold on my gun\r\nagain, and t' first job I'll put it to will be to shoot every soul of\r\nthem sneaking, preaching thieves but t' girl, and I'll set her up as a\r\nbush-ranger's jin. She's mine by right, sure enough, now that I've put\r\nan end to t' palavering of that sneaking fool Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Peter, man,\" was the answer of one of the men, \"I fancy them black\r\nfellows didn't half like yer putting a knife into their leader; and down\r\nt' country folks would call it a murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"It saved Government a good rope,\" said Peter, \"for that was his due. He\r\nwas a bigger rogue than me, and that's saying a deal.\"\r\n\r\nThe fearful oaths that these abandoned men mingled with their\r\nconversation perfectly appalled the listening boys, and they felt great\r\nrelief when they rose; and each drinking a cup of brandy, Peter said,--\r\n\r\n\"Now come on, and let's get our work done. Them fools will be forced to\r\nslacken their pace soon, for the beasts will never hold out over yon\r\nscrub; and when we've got our guns and horses, and made an end of the\r\nlot of thieves, we'll push on and see if we can't do a stroke of\r\nbusiness among any new squatters.\"\r\n\r\nThen the man made a speech to his black troop, in their own language,\r\nwhich seemed to give them pleasure, for they danced and clashed their\r\nspears, and started up to continue their route. Thankfully the watchers\r\nsaw the wretches cross the river, and fall into the snare of continuing\r\nover the scrub; but they did not venture to descend for half an hour,\r\nwhen they had lost sight of the rangers, and concluded they must be\r\nseparated by a distance which rendered them safe.\r\n\r\n\"What rascals!\" exclaimed Gerald. \"It was well I had not one of the\r\nguns, Arthur; I don't think I could have helped shooting Black Peter,\r\nwhen he boasted that he had murdered Bill. I think I had a right.\"\r\n\r\n\"No you hadn't, Gerald,\" said Hugh. \"It would not have been English\r\njustice. The worst criminal has a right to a trial by jury. What do you\r\nsay, Arthur?\"\r\n\r\n\"We should have some trouble in summoning a jury here, Hugh,\" answered\r\nArthur; \"nevertheless, I should not have liked to take on myself the\r\noffice of executioner. Besides, you must remember, such an act would\r\nhave brought destruction on ourselves, and on all who depend on us. God\r\nwill bring the villain to justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys made their way through the thick wood till they reached the\r\nlittle glade where their anxious friends were watching for them.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" cried Gerald; \"we need not call over the roll. Now you must\r\nall be content to form the rear-guard of the bush-rangers. I suppose,\r\nArthur, there is no need to hurry; we are not particularly desirous to\r\novertake the rogues.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear boys!\" exclaimed Mr. Mayburn; \"Arthur, do you speak. Is it\r\nsafe to venture from this quiet retreat yet? Consider these lawless men\r\nmight, at any moment, turn round; and it seems they would not scruple\r\nto commit murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was Bill with 'em, sir?\" asked David, looking very much ashamed.\r\n\r\nWith much kindness and consideration, Arthur gently broke to the poor\r\nlad the melancholy fate of his vile brother; and David shed many tears\r\nfor the unhappy convict.\r\n\r\n\"I were auld enough to have known better, sir,\" said he; \"he couldn't\r\nhave gettin' me into bad ways, if I'd thought on my prayers and turned\r\nagain' him; and if I'd held out, things mightn't have turned out so bad\r\nwi' him. Them that lets themselves be 'ticed to do bad deeds, is worse\r\nnor them that 'tices 'em. God forgive me for niver speaking out like a\r\nman to poor Bill!\"\r\n\r\nMargaret spoke kindly to the sorrowful man, showing him the fearful\r\nwarning sent in this sad catastrophe, and beseeching him never to forget\r\nit; but to pray continually that he might be kept strictly in the right\r\npath.\r\n\r\nWilkins was much shocked at the violent death of the convict; but,\r\nnevertheless, he whispered to Jenny, \"He's well ta'en out of t' way; for\r\nhe were a bigger scoundrel nor Peter hisself, for all his grand\r\nrigmarole talk.\"\r\n\r\nAs the lame horse was unfit for work yet, it was led after the rest; and\r\nArthur, who chose to walk, selected David for his companion, and took\r\nthe opportunity, while he consoled him under his heavy affliction, to\r\ndirect his softened heart to good and holy aspirations. They continued\r\ntheir journey along the right bank of the rivulet; the country being\r\nmore fertile, and the grassy plains more favorable for the horses than\r\namong the brushwood.\r\n\r\nFor three days they proceeded undisturbed, and with revived hopes. Then\r\nthe scenery became still more beautiful; the ground was covered with\r\nlofty trees, on which already the young buds were forming. These trees\r\nwere tenanted by thousands of lovely birds; and their cheerful notes\r\nenlivened the solitude. In the distance before them rose a pile of\r\nscattered rocky mountains, which, as they drew nearer, they saw were\r\ncovered with brushwood, and might have formed a barrier to their path,\r\nbut they seemed to be pierced by innumerable narrow winding gorges.\r\n\r\n\"We must proceed with great caution and watchfulness here,\" said Arthur;\r\n\"for it is not improbable that we may have fallen unhappily upon the\r\ntrack of our enemies, and we must have gained ground on them, now that\r\nwe are all mounted again. We must be careful to avoid an encounter among\r\nthese perplexing mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have two guns,\" said Gerald, \"and we should have no difficulty in\r\nkeeping one of these narrow passes against the whole undisciplined gang;\r\nthen we could have our bowmen hid in the brushwood above, to shower down\r\ndestruction on the foe. It is a grand spot for a skirmish!\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid that we should be called on to make this lovely solitude a\r\nfield of blood!\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"How dare proud and disobedient man\r\nprofane the sanctity of Nature, and desecrate her grand and marvellous\r\nworks. Does not the contemplation of these mighty mountains, spreading\r\nas far as the eye can reach, broken into fantastic forms, and apparently\r\ninaccessible and impassable, startle and humiliate the presuming pride\r\nof fallen man?\"\r\n\r\n    \"There is a voiceless eloquence in earth\r\n    Telling of him who gave her wonders birth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep in the rear, papa,\" said Arthur; \"we must reconnoitre secretly,\r\nbefore we venture into these mazes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Choose a narrow pass, Arthur,\" cried Gerald. \"It will suit best for our\r\nmanoeuvres, if we come to a battle. Halloo! what wild beast can that\r\nbe I hear roaring. No Australian animal that we have met with yet has\r\nsuch a sonorous voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack!\" cried Ruth, clinging to her brother, behind whom she was\r\nmounted. \"Jack, honey, stop a bit, hear ye; yon's a bear, and I'se\r\nfeared of my life; it's a bear like them 'at dances about at t' fairs!\"\r\n\r\n\"A bear growls,\" said Hugh; \"but that is decidedly a roar; it is more\r\nlike the voice of the royal lion, and we shall have some sport at last.\r\nTo arms! to arms!\"\r\n\r\nJack and Ruth were some yards in advance of the rest, when suddenly from\r\na thicket just before them, a wild bull rushed furiously upon their\r\npath, tossing his head, as if enraged that his solitude had been\r\ninvaded, or probably expecting to encounter the powerful opponent which\r\nhad banished him in disgrace from his own herd. He was a huge, dark-red\r\nanimal, with short sharp horns and broad forehead, and his fierce and\r\nfiery eye, and loud threatening bellow, denoted him to be a dangerous\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\nHe stopped for a moment and eyed the horse, then tore round and round,\r\nthrowing up the earth with his horns, and uttering continually a deep\r\nsullen roar. Jack was turning round to avoid the unpleasant meeting,\r\nwhen suddenly the infuriated animal arrested his whirling course, and\r\nbefore Jack could extricate himself from Ruth's arms, to use his spear,\r\nthe beast had rushed impetuously on the horse, and gored it frightfully.\r\nThe terrified horse immediately reared, and flung both his riders off.\r\n\r\nJack, though considerably bruised, sprang up, dragged the senseless Ruth\r\nout of the path of the mad creature, and placed her under the bushes,\r\nand then returned with his spear ready to defend himself; but he found\r\nto his great grief his poor horse thrown down, trampled on, and gored by\r\nthe frenzied animal, which continued to repeat its merciless attacks,\r\nregardless of the many wounds inflicted by Wilkins and Hugh, who had\r\ngalloped up in haste to aid Jack.\r\n\r\nAt length, tired with goring the horse, the bull turned on Jack, who\r\nfaced him with his uplifted spear; but before he could strike, Arthur\r\ncalled out to them all to draw back, and, riding up himself, he shot the\r\nbeast through the head. It fell heavily, and Wilkins dismounted, drew\r\nout his knife, and went up to finish the execution; but he was too\r\nearly, for the powerful animal rose again to his legs, caught the man on\r\nhis strong brow, and flung him over his head to a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nA second shot, however, despatched the bull, and then all went up to\r\nWilkins, whom they found insensible; but, though much bruised and\r\nstunned by the fall, he was providentially unwounded by the horns of the\r\nformidable animal. The exertions of his distressed friends soon restored\r\nthe poor man to his senses, and he was able to take little Nakinna, to\r\nlook at the \"big dingo,\" which astonished her so much, and even\r\nBaldabella deigned to express some interest at the sight of an animal so\r\nmuch larger than any she had ever beheld. Wilkins declared it was a\r\nshame to leave so much good meat lying to waste on the high road; but\r\nthey were now in a land of plenty; besides, the dark coarse flesh of the\r\nbull was not of a tempting quality, and it was agreed that it might as\r\nwell be abandoned.\r\n\r\nBut the question arose, \"Where did this bull come from?\" It was\r\ncertainly not an Australian animal; and should it have wandered from any\r\nsettlement, they might hope that they were not so very far from\r\ncivilization; and as they discussed the probability, and continued their\r\njourney, they looked out carefully lest they should encounter any more\r\nwild cattle.\r\n\r\nA very narrow passage, between two high wood-covered rocky walls,\r\noffered a convenient pass, and even suitable to the warlike plan of\r\nO'Brien; and Arthur taking the lead, with Gerald behind him, they\r\nventured to leave the rest at the entrance of the pass, till they had\r\nfirst ascertained the safety and direction of the road.\r\n\r\n\"Arthur,\" said Gerald, in a suppressed voice, \"I am certain that I hear\r\na rustling in the bushes over our heads. Do stop a moment, and let me\r\nsend an arrow into the bush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray forbear, my boy,\" answered Arthur; \"if it should be another wild\r\nbull, your arrow would only irritate it; and if, as it is probable, the\r\nbush-ranger should be some harmless pigeon or parrot, let it live, we\r\nare well provided with food. Let us rather turn our thoughts to these\r\nperplexing passages, which strike out on all sides of us, and which will\r\nbewilder us till we shall never find our way back to our friends, if we\r\ngo much further. Now, which of these roads shall we take? After all,\r\nGerald, I think we had better turn back for the rest, and take our\r\nchance altogether. Which of these puzzling alleys did we come through?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that dismal hole, Arthur,\" answered he, laughing. \"We came along\r\nhere, I remember this beautiful overhanging acacia.\"\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke, some stones fell from above on them; and Gerald,\r\nseizing the pendent branch of the acacia, leaped from his horse, and\r\nbefore Arthur could interfere was swinging and climbing up the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Gerald, you rash fellow,\" cried Arthur, \"what has induced you to such a\r\nwild frolic? what are you about to do? Do come down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not before I make out the meaning of the acacia showering down stones\r\non my head, instead of fruit,\" answered Gerald; and then Arthur heard\r\nhim say in a tone of astonishment, \"Halloo! my friend, what will you\r\nplease to be looking after?\"\r\n\r\nIn utter amazement and alarm at hearing the boy address any being in\r\nthat strange solitude, Arthur tied the horses to the tree, and, armed\r\nwith his gun, climbed the rock so expeditiously, that he arrested\r\nGerald's spear, as he was about to strike a tall, rough-looking man,\r\nwith whom he was struggling, and who turned round as Arthur appeared,\r\nsaying, \"How many more on ye may there be? We can match ye all, rogues\r\nas ye are. Have ye fetched our beast back?\"\r\n\r\n\"My good man,\" said Arthur, \"it seems to me that we have been both\r\nmistaken. You take us for bush-rangers, and we thought you belonged to\r\nthe same thievish community. Now, we are poor travellers, robbed by\r\nthose rangers, who have, with difficulty, made our escape from the\r\nplunderers, destitute of all property.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll surelie, not have a face to tell me that, young fellow,\" answered\r\nthe man, \"when I seed ye mysel' atop of one of our horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"That certainly is a suspicious circumstance,\" answered Arthur,\r\nlaughing; \"and I must tell the truth; we did borrow the horses from our\r\njailers, that we might have the means of making our escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's likely all flam,\" said the man. \"Howsomever, ye mun come afore\r\nour master, and make out yer story. I'se not soft enough to let ye off\r\nthis like.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be very glad indeed to see your master,\" replied Arthur;\r\n\"especially if he is of our country, and near at hand. Who is he? and\r\nwhere is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a squatter,\" grumbled the man, \"and he's down yonder, seeking out\r\na road to get through these in-and-out walls fit to puzzle a conjuror.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will show us an easier mode of descent than that by which we\r\nreached you,\" said Arthur, \"we will not only willingly accompany you;\r\nbut we will take with us the whole of our party, and the stolen horses\r\ninto the bargain.\"\r\n\r\nThe man looked very suspiciously at the free and easy strangers, but,\r\nanxious to recover his master's property, he led them by an easy descent\r\nto the pass, and then suffered O'Brien to go and bring up the rest of\r\nthe party, retaining Arthur as a hostage. But the astonishment of the\r\nstranger was very great, when he saw the long line of the travellers\r\nfilling up the narrow pass; and struck by the venerable appearance of\r\nMr. Mayburn, who rode first, his hard features relaxed, he touched his\r\ncap with respect, and rode before the travellers, to be the first to\r\nannounce to his master this wonderful encounter.\r\n\r\nKeeping their guide in sight, they followed him through many narrow and\r\nintricate paths, gradually ascending, till they came on a wide and level\r\ngrass-covered spot, still surrounded by high mountainous walls. A number\r\nof horses were feeding on the grass, and at the foot of a majestic and\r\nalmost perpendicular cliff, clothed with a thick forest, were reposing a\r\nparty of men, eating their repast, which was spread out upon the grass.\r\nOne of the party looked round, and, with a cry of joy, the wanderers\r\nrecognized their friend Edward Deverell.\r\n\r\n\"Arthur! Hugh!\" he exclaimed, \"my dear and reverend friend Mr. Mayburn!\r\nMargaret too! What pleasure! and what miracle can have brought us\r\ntogether once more in these strange and wild mountains?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your man has brought us up before your worship on a charge of\r\nstealing,\" said Arthur, laughing; \"and he certainly did not exceed his\r\nduty; he had good grounds for apprehending us, for it seems we are\r\nactually travelling on your horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad they are in such good hands,\" answered Deverell; \"but however\r\ndid my shepherd meet with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir,\" said the man, \"ye see, I heared summut like a shot, and off\r\nI set, for I was curious like to see what it might be; and I clomb and\r\ncrambled about, till all at once I hears talking, and I peers through t'\r\nbushes, and there I sees one of these here young gents atop of our\r\nSallydun, and says I to myself, 'Them's rangers, they are;' and when\r\nyoung master there clomb up, and defied me like, I thought it were\r\nnat'ral that they were rangers, and I laid hands on 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the man had finished his narrative, repeated and joyful\r\ngreetings passed between the friends, and Edward Deverell explained that\r\nhis appearance at such a distance from his home originated in his desire\r\nto pursue and capture the audacious bush-rangers who had robbed him of\r\nso much property.\r\n\r\n\"I have brought with me three of my own stock-keepers to identify the\r\ncattle,\" he said; \"the rest, as you may see from their complexion and\r\nuniform, are of that useful body, the native police.\"\r\n\r\nThese dark-complexioned officials were of very striking appearance;\r\ntheir dress was light and scanty, bristling with pistols and sabres;\r\ntheir feet bare, and their hair long and flowing. Their keen, glittering\r\neyes ran over the strangers in a most professional manner, very\r\nembarrassing to Wilkins and David, who both held down their heads before\r\nthe searching glances. David seemed afraid to appear before his injured\r\nmaster, who looked much surprised to see him attached to Mr. Mayburn's\r\nparty; but discreetly deferred any investigation into the affair, till\r\nhe should be informed what strange chance had brought the voyagers to\r\nIndia into the very heart of Australia.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember, Edward Deverell,\" said Hugh, \"that Gerald and I\r\nalways wished to be here, instead of broiling among the Hindoos, and\r\nbeing carried about in palanquins? And I believe Arthur and Margaret\r\nlonged for it in their hearts, only they conceived it was papa's duty to\r\nfulfil his engagement. Yet, after all, it is not our own will, but a\r\nhappy ordination of Providence, that has at length united us; and now, I\r\nsuppose, we must follow your example and _squat_ in Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"But consider the risk, my dear Hugh,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"Even our\r\nexperienced friend Deverell has not escaped being plundered by these\r\nsavages, who are too frequently in union with unscrupulous murderers. I\r\nshould live in continual dread in these wild regions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, papa,\" said Gerald, \"there are robbers and murderers even in happy\r\nand civilized Britain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless there are, Gerald,\" said Edward Deverell. \"No civilization\r\ncan eradicate the black spot of our fallen nature; it is only the grace\r\nand mercy of God that can keep the evil spirit in subjection. But have\r\nno fears, my dear Mr. Mayburn; we must not alarm Margaret when we hope\r\nto persuade her to visit our lonely retreat. We have an excellent police\r\nstaff; and when our servants are properly drilled, and our fences made\r\nsecure, we shall be as safe as we should be in Europe. Now give the\r\nhorses to the servants; sit down and eat; and then let me hear your\r\nstrange adventures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTravellers' Wonders.--The Detective Force.--A Trap for the Rangers.--The\r\nSkirmish and the Victory.--Daisies in Australia.--The Constancy of Susan\r\nRaine.--The Trial and Sentence of the Natives.--Peter and his\r\nColleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur was the narrator, and his long and wonderful story produced much\r\nsympathy and astonishment in his friendly hearer. At the earnest request\r\nof Margaret, the delinquent Davy was pardoned, and reinstalled in his\r\noffice of stock-keeper; and Mr. Deverell promised to interest himself to\r\nobtain the emancipation of Wilkins.\r\n\r\n\"I must enlist you all to join my small force,\" said Edward Deverell;\r\n\"for it is my intention to persevere in my attempt to recover my cattle\r\nand punish the robbers. My black allies are of opinion that the men who\r\ndrove off the cattle will dispose of them to some of those unprincipled\r\ndealers who range the interior to pick up such bargains, and who can\r\nagain sell them for large profits to the Macquarie gold-diggers, who\r\nmake no inquiries how they were obtained. They must necessarily bring\r\nthe cattle through the direct pass of these mountains, which is not\r\nquite so perplexing as that you had selected; and we are encamped here\r\nto watch for and intercept them. From your report, the party will be\r\nmore numerous than we expected; but the hungry blacks who swell their\r\ntrain, in the hopes of receiving a share of the brandy and tobacco, are\r\nno heroes. I think, Hugh, we shall be able to give them a drubbing.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if there could be a doubt of it!\" said Hugh, contemptuously. \"We are\r\nall ready to enlist into the ranks, captain, I will engage to say--that\r\nis, with the exception of papa and the womankind; the chaplain to the\r\nregiment, and the Sisters of Charity who are to attend on the wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most useful members of the army they will be,\" answered Deverell, \"if\r\nwe come to close quarters; for, greatly as I abhor warfare, I do not\r\nexpect to settle this vexatious matter without bloodshed.\"\r\n\r\n\"If ye did, sir,\" said Wilkins, \"ye'd be wrong; and, depend on't, ye'd\r\nsoon have plenty more such-like customers. If a mad dog were to bite a\r\nman, and he let it run off, he'd be safe to bite other folks, and that's\r\nnot fair. I say, knock him on t' head at first.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cases will hardly bear comparison, Wilkins,\" replied Mr. Mayburn;\r\n\"and it has ever been a question among reasoning men whether the\r\ndestitute ought to be subjected to capital punishment for seizing a\r\nshare of the abundance of the prosperous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Robin Hood law!--rob the rich to feed the poor,\" cried Gerald. \"Only\r\nthink of papa encouraging bush-ranging!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Mayburn, spare your compassion for these rogues,\" said\r\nDeverell, laughing. \"These men are not destitute--they are worthless,\r\nidle vagabonds, and, according to the by-laws of squatters and settlers,\r\nthey are amenable to justice. I shall certainly reclaim my own property,\r\ngive the scoundrels a sound thrashing, and, if they show fight, we are\r\nprepared for actual service, and they must take the consequences.\"\r\n\r\nIt was long before the party were tired of conversation, and settled to\r\ntake a secure night's rest; while the watchful police relieved each\r\nother, lest the rangers should pass during the night. In the morning\r\nthey placed themselves in convenient posts on the mountains, where they\r\ncould command all the approaches; but the day was somewhat advanced when\r\nnotice was given that objects were seen approaching at a distance. Then\r\nthe work of preparation actually began; along the heights of the pass\r\nwere placed the rifle-rangers, as Hugh termed them, consisting of\r\nArthur, Gerald, and himself, Mr. Deverell, and six of the police.\r\nMargaret and Mr. Mayburn, with the women, were left in perfect security\r\nin the little glen where the encampment was formed; and the rest of the\r\nparty guarded the end of the pass, to secure any of the enemy who might\r\nsucceed in reaching it.\r\n\r\n\"We conclude,\" said Mr. Deverell, \"that the rangers, who doubtless are\r\nwell acquainted with the pass, will drive the cattle on before them. Now\r\nwe propose to secure these as they issue from this walled passage, and\r\nwhen they are all again in our possession, the stock-keepers must be\r\nready to drive them off; while the rest of our troop must intercept and\r\ncapture the drivers, to prevent pursuit. And now, Davy, I will test your\r\nfidelity again. Will you take up your whip and set off with our beasts\r\nto the station?\"\r\n\r\n\"If ye'd not object, master,\" said Davy, humbly, \"I'd as lief have a\r\nshot among 'em afore I set out, specially at that deep, black-hearted\r\nrogue Peter, as put an end to our Bill. I can't say, master, Bill didn't\r\nget far wrang; but Peter's out and out a worse chap, and it wasn't his\r\nplace to kill a better fellow nor hisself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will obey my orders, Davy,\" said his master, \"and leave the\r\npunishment of Peter in our hands. I will take care he shall suffer for\r\nhis misdeeds; and you will do your duty best by looking after your old\r\nfour-footed friends. Have the rogues spared poor Lily, David? She was of\r\na fine breed, Gerald, and I was deeply incensed at the rogues for\r\nselecting her to carry off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless ye, master, they count nought of breeds,\" answered Davy; \"all\r\nthey want is to kill plenty for beef, and to swop all they've left for\r\nspurrits and backy; Lily was to t' fore when I cut off from 'em, bonnie\r\ncretur, but she'll be hard up, if they've brought her this far. She\r\nalways kenned me, master, and let me milk her; but she niver could bide\r\nthem black fellows nigh hand her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Davy,\" answered Deverell. \"Then your duty is to drive off\r\nLily, and as many more beasts as you can manage, to this glen; and to\r\nremain here with Mr. Mayburn till we come up, as we hope, with our\r\nprisoners. Then we shall set out in good spirits on our long journey to\r\nDaisy Grange.\"\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour all the arrangements were made, the brave\r\ndefenders were all ready: by this time the procession was close to the\r\nmountains; the bush-rangers were driving the cattle before them,\r\nfollowed by Peter, with his black troop. He now appeared painted like\r\nhis men with the peculiar insignia of war and defiance, his body being\r\nmarked in red lines in the form of a skeleton, a decoration he had\r\nprobably adopted to conciliate the natives.\r\n\r\nThe weary cattle were slowly urged into the narrow rock-bound path, one\r\nof the rangers heading them, to lead them along the right pass, the\r\nrest following them closely. The confined path rung with the lowing of\r\nthe alarmed and reluctant cattle, forced onward cruelly by the spears of\r\ntheir drivers, whose wild and terrific oaths completed the discordant\r\ntumult. At length, when the cattle-leader emerged from the narrow part\r\nof the pass to a more open space, and had his face turned back to see\r\nthat the line of animals was properly brought forward, he was easily\r\nseized, gagged, and bound by the dexterous police. Then, as the animals\r\none after another appeared, they were driven off by the stock-keepers to\r\nthe glen.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party were prepared to capture the rangers as they\r\nfollowed the cattle; but the sudden cry of the leader, who had been\r\nseized, and which was easily distinguished amidst the clamor of the\r\nnoisy cattle, was heard by Peter. The shrewd man at once comprehended\r\nthe opposition that awaited them, and calling on his black fellows to\r\nwield their spears and follow him, he rushed on, with his men behind\r\nhim, to the scene of conflict. The police on the heights allowed him and\r\nsome of his black followers to proceed a little forward, and then fired\r\na volley down into the midst of the blacks that were left behind, who,\r\nsurprised and bewildered, and ever terrified at the effects of\r\nfire-arms, turned back tumultuously and fled. In vain the desperate\r\nBlack Peter shouted to rally his followers, and fought desperately\r\nagainst the men at the end of the pass with the few supporters he had\r\nbrought on. He and his troops were soon overpowered, and all captured\r\nand bound, with very little bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\"Huzza!\" cried Gerald; \"a glorious victory! Arthur, you must write the\r\ndespatch; naming the superior force of the enemy, the cool and\r\ndetermined bravery of the little body of defenders, the desperate\r\nresistance of the furious bush-rangers, their complete discomfiture;\r\nand, finally, you must particularly mention the prudent, vigorous, and\r\nsuccessful support of the young Lieutenant O'Brien, who is recommended\r\nfor promotion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Margaret will consider us all heroes,\" said Hugh; \"and we must hasten\r\non as speedily as possible to allay her anxiety for us. But, Captain\r\nDeverell, whatever are we to do with these prisoners?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are bound to convey or send the dangerous bush-rangers to Sydney,\"\r\nanswered Deverell, \"there to be dealt with according to law. As for the\r\ncowardly, treacherous, and ignorant natives, we must devise some\r\npunishment for them; but, if possible, we will not encumber ourselves\r\nwith them, nor be obliged to feed them on our journey. For the present\r\nwe must contrive to keep them in some place of security till the police\r\nreturn from their useless chase of the unhappy blacks who have fled.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who will, I hope, escape,\" said Arthur; \"for they are but tools in\r\nthe hands of these abandoned convicts, and are scarcely themselves\r\nresponsible for their deeds of evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" said Gerald; \"this large cave would make a good jail, and we\r\nmight build up the entrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then ye'll have to look about for a lot of caves, Master Gerald,\" said\r\nWilkins, \"and lodge 'em, as they say down t' country, on t' separate\r\nsystem, or we'se find all our birds flown to-morrow morning, I'll\r\nengage. Why, bless you, if that there Black Peter was shut up for a day\r\nwi' a new-born babby, he'd make 't a rogue for life. He'd make a parson\r\ninto a bush-ranger, give him a bit of time; and my fancy is as how he's\r\nhelped by that bad 'un as is his master; God save us!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt, Wilkins,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"that the Great Spirit\r\nof Evil does readily and unfailingly stretch forth his hand to aid his\r\nwicked followers, and we should all join in your prayer, my good man.\r\nMay God save us in the hour of temptation!\"\r\n\r\nAround the little hollow where the encampment was found, and where the\r\nyoung heroes were joyfully welcomed, were many small caves in the rocks,\r\nin which the prisoners, black and white, were separately enclosed. One\r\nof the stock-keepers had received a spear-wound in his arm; and one of\r\nthe misguided natives was killed by a rifle-shot. These were all the\r\ncasualties. When the police returned from the pursuit of the black\r\nfugitives, who had taken refuge in a thick wood, after many of them had\r\nbeen severely wounded, Mr. Deverell requested that all further pursuit\r\nshould be relinquished, as the cattle were recovered and the ringleaders\r\nwere now in confinement, which he knew would be a terrible punishment to\r\nthem, even though it were only for one night.\r\n\r\nMargaret and Mr. Mayburn paid every care and attention to the wounded\r\nman, and when all their duties were fulfilled, the united friends sat\r\ndown, to rest on the green turf, and to talk of the hopeful future.\r\n\r\n\"Now, we are all anxious to know, Edward Deverell,\" said Hugh, \"if you\r\nhave got your house built, or if you are all dwelling in tents; and,\r\nabove all, what kind of place is Daisy Grange?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have got my house built, Hugh,\" answered he, \"and Daisy Grange I\r\nwill leave undescribed, only assuring you that it will be completely a\r\nparadise in my eyes when I see you all there, which I trust will be\r\nbefore many days are passed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the daisies?\" inquired Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"The daisies were at first coy and capricious in their new home,\"\r\nanswered he, \"but finally they have yielded to care and perseverance,\r\nand consented to adorn my small lawn, in sufficient numbers to justify\r\nme in retaining the dear name for my much beloved home.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does Emma do in the wilderness?\" asked Hugh.\r\n\r\n\"She cultivates flowers,\" replied Deverell, \"sews on buttons, and\r\nperforms other needful female occupations, plays, sings, reads, and is\r\nnot ashamed to assist her mother, and Susan the dairy-maid, to make the\r\nbutter and cheese.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that Susan Raine?\" asked Margaret, anxiously, for she saw Wilkins\r\nlooking at Mr. Deverell with much agitation. \"Is that the pretty, modest\r\nSusan, that was our fellow-voyager?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the same girl,\" answered Deverell. \"Poor Susan, we are all very\r\nsorry for her; she had to endure a grievous disappointment, for she had\r\ntaken the opportunity of accompanying us, as our servant, in order that\r\nshe might join her betrothed, a wild fellow that had been transported\r\nfor some venial offence; and when we reached Melbourne, and instituted\r\nthe regular inquiry, we found the man had made his escape in an India\r\nvessel, with some vile wretches who had been working with him. I fear he\r\nis wholly unworthy of the good girl, who still mourns so deeply for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's nought but a reg'lar scoundrel,\" said Wilkins, impetuously, \"he\r\nis; and she'd sarved him right if she'd gone and wed another; that's\r\nwhat she has done likely, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I certainly wished her to do,\" said Deverell, looking\r\nsurprised at the free interference of Wilkins; \"but the silly girl is\r\nstill haunted by the wild hope of reclaiming the unfortunate man who was\r\nthe companion of her childhood. She has refused the young herdsman who\r\nis so kindly attended by Miss Margaret; a worthy fellow, and has\r\ndetermined to remain unmarried for the sake of the convict who has so\r\ncruelly neglected her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's like my bonnie true-hearted lass,\" said Wilkins, much excited.\r\n\"Scamp as I were to lose her! But now please, Miss Margaret, to put in a\r\nword like for me. Tell t' master I'se nought like so bad but that\r\nthere's some hopes of me, if Sue will take up wi' me; but how can I look\r\nfor't?\"\r\n\r\nMargaret undertook to explain Wilkins's position to Deverell, and to\r\nplead for him to Susan; and the rough convict turned away with a tear in\r\nhis eye, as the recollection of youthful and innocent days shone through\r\nthe mist of evil deeds that had darkened his mature life.\r\n\r\nMr. Deverell was pleased with the story of Wilkins, and as he would be\r\nfar removed from temptation at the settlement, and would be carefully\r\nwatched by his good friends, he promised to bestow Susan on him; and now\r\nthey prepared to break up the encampment, and to pursue their journey\r\nunder pleasant auspices.\r\n\r\n\"But before we set out,\" said Mr. Deverell, \"it will be necessary to\r\ncome to some, arrangement about our troublesome prisoners. We must hold\r\na court of justice, as imposing as circumstances will permit, and\r\nendeavor to alarm them, and make a salutary impression on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a handsome rocky throne for the bench,\" said Hugh. \"Please to\r\nascend to the elevation, Mr. Judge Deverell, and look as grave as you\r\npossibly can; papa will sit by you in the character of Mercy, to\r\nmitigate the severity of Justice. Arthur and Gerald must take that hill,\r\nand Jack and I will remain here to represent counsel. We will not take\r\nthe trouble to call a jury, because I know my lord judge has made up his\r\nmind about the sentence. Now, all you people stand round, and leave a\r\npassage for the police to bring up the prisoners. Will this do, my\r\nlord?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am content, Hugh, provided you all look serious,\" answered Deverell.\r\n\"You must make the most of our strength, and display your arms to\r\nadvantage. With these ignorant natives, in their present condition,\r\nintimidation is the only mode of subjection. I hope the time is not very\r\ndistant when milder measures may be used to win them to civilization. We\r\nare commencing the work by educating the children.\"\r\n\r\nThe glen was first cleared by sending the stock-keepers forward with the\r\ncattle, as their progress must necessarily be slow; then, one after\r\nanother, the police released the trembling, crouching savages from the\r\ncaves, and brought them before the judge. The poor wretches, at the\r\nsight of the array of guns and spears before them, endured all the\r\nterrors of death. Deverell, who had acquired some facility in speaking\r\ntheir language, made a long address to the terrified men; reproaching\r\nthem with their folly and ingratitude in robbing him, who had never\r\nrefused to assist them in their days of destitution, and who earnestly\r\ndesired their welfare. He warned them of the danger of dealing with the\r\nbush-rangers, who always deceived them, and of frequenting the bush\r\ntaverns to obtain the poisonous liquor which would in the end destroy\r\ntheir whole nation. He threatened them with instant death if they dared\r\nto transgress again; and then, satisfied with the fright he had given\r\nthem, he relieved them from their misery by giving them leave to depart;\r\na permission which they did not delay a moment to make use of; but\r\nsprung up the rocks, and speedily disappeared to seek the concealment of\r\nthe bush.\r\n\r\nThere remained now only the four vile bush-rangers to dispose of; but\r\nthese men, all escaped convicts, Mr. Deverell declined to punish,\r\nproposing to commit them to the charge of four of the mounted police,\r\nwho were to conduct them, or, as these officials appropriately expressed\r\nit, to drive them to Sydney, and there deliver them into the hands of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nThese ruffians were therefore brought from their respective dungeons,\r\nand manacled two together; their persons were searched, lest they should\r\nhave any concealed arms; and their legs were then released from the\r\nfetters. Peter, who obstinately refused to submit to the incumbrance of\r\nclothing, required no search, and was coupled to one of his bush ranging\r\nfriends, loudly showering curses on his conquerors.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean us to set out fasting with these malignant scoundrels?\" he\r\nyelled out. \"Ye're fine Christians, to hunger folks. And ye know as well\r\nas we do these greedy black rascals will prig all our rations on t'\r\nroad.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Deverell did know that the black police were scandalously harsh\r\nwith their white prisoners, and he therefore ordered that these wretched\r\ncriminals should sit down for half an hour, and be supplied with a\r\nplentiful breakfast of cold meat, which they began to devour ravenously,\r\nwatched curiously by Ruth, who concealed herself in a thicket, that she\r\nmight look in safety at these terrible bush-rangers. All the rest of the\r\nparty, glad to avoid the sight of the wretches, wandered off to another\r\nlittle glen which opened from their encampment, except Mr. Deverell and\r\nArthur, who had called the police to one side to give them a strict\r\ncharge to be watchful and determined, but at the same time to treat\r\ntheir prisoners with humanity.\r\n\r\nWhile they were conversing, they were startled and alarmed by a scream\r\nfrom Ruth, who, they believed, had left the encampment with the rest of\r\nthe party, and on turning round they saw, to their great vexation, the\r\nranger who had been linked with Peter galloping off on the horse of one\r\nof the police, which, ready for starting, had been tied to a tree near\r\nthe prisoners. The police mounted the other three horses that were\r\nready, and speedily pursued the fugitive; while Deverell and Arthur went\r\nup in haste, and found, to their extreme mortification, that the villain\r\nPeter was also missing. The remainder of the party, recalled from their\r\nramble by the shriek of Ruth, had now joined them; and when the agitated\r\ngirl was able to give an account of the occurrence, she said:--\r\n\r\n\"He reached out, and took a cloak off t' horse, and groped in t' pockets\r\ntill he fetched out summut, maybe a key, for I heard a click; and then\r\nPeter jumped up and laid hands on t' horse; but t' other fellow was\r\nsharp after him, and pushed him off, and loped atop on his back\r\nhisself, and galloped off like mad, and left Peter standing. Oh master!\r\nhow awful he swore and stamped about, and took off right up to me, and I\r\nshrieked out; and then he scrambled up yon wood.\" And Ruth pointed to\r\nthe precipitous wood-covered wall of the glen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nA Chase over the Mountains.--The Frightful End of the\r\nBush-ranger.--Ruth's Opinion.--The Cereopsis.--A Description of the\r\nColony.--The Dingo.--The Cattle at Home.--The Park.--The Arrival at\r\nDaisy Grange.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had not time to consider what steps to take, when Wilkins cried\r\nout, \"Yon's the rogue;\" and they caught a glimpse of the painted figure\r\nof the fugitive among the trees, at a height which seemed almost\r\nimpossible to reach, for they all considered this precipitous rock\r\ninaccessible.\r\n\r\n\"We must not let the villain escape us,\" cried Jack, \"or he will be sure\r\nto lead more poor wretches astray. Some of you follow me.\" And, without\r\nfurther delay, he caught hold of the branches of the lowest tree, and\r\nswung himself up, grasping the overhanging boughs, and forcing his way\r\nthrough the entangled bushes with toil and danger, while Ruth continued\r\nto cry out like a distracted creature.\r\n\r\nIt was strange, that in this dilemma the usual cool presence of mind of\r\nthe fearless and determined ruffian seemed to forsake him. If he had\r\nsought the labyrinthine passages of the widely-spread mountain, he might\r\neasily have bewildered his pursuers; but he continually exposed himself\r\nto observation through the trees on the mountain-side.\r\n\r\nWilkins and one of the herdsmen of Mr. Deverell soon followed Jack,\r\ntheir whole mind bent on capturing this treacherous and sanguinary\r\nvillain. Behind them, urged by curiosity, anxiety for her brother, and\r\ndetestation of Black Peter, the excited girl Ruth, notwithstanding the\r\nefforts of her friends, plunged through the bushes to follow them,\r\nshouting wildly to her brother when she caught glimpses of the spectral\r\nfigure of the convict, with the red lines painted on his body.\r\n\r\nOnward up that tedious ascent the practised bush-ranger proceeded, not\r\neven pausing for breath; and his half-exhausted pursuers began to fear\r\nhe would escape them; but, after half an hour's struggle, a light\r\ngleamed through the trees. They believed they were coming to a more open\r\nspace, when, rather than allow the convict to escape, the men resolved\r\nto use their guns. The next minute they emerged from the wood, and the\r\nwhole party shrunk back, astonished at the magnificent scene that lay\r\nbefore them. A few feet from the wood a vast abyss opened. The eye could\r\nnot penetrate its depths: it appeared fathomless and dark, for on all\r\nsides it was bounded by the perpendicular cliff which descended from the\r\nverge of the forest.\r\n\r\nFor a moment only could the dizzy sight regard that terrific descent,\r\nfrom which only three feet of solid earth separated them; and they clung\r\nto the trees, as they looked round to search for the fugitive. To their\r\ngreat horror, they beheld the desperate man, making his way along the\r\nnarrow hem of earth, supported by a spear he had caught up on one hand,\r\nand holding by the trees on the other, and apparently seeking for a\r\nconvenient spot where he might again descend into the wood. He stopped\r\nand turned round, and observing his pursuers, who feared even to use\r\ntheir guns in such a perilous position, the vindictive wretch poised\r\nand flung the spear. But before it had even reached its destination, a\r\nyell of mortal terror was heard; the shelf of rock on which he stood,\r\ngave way under the impetuosity of his movement; and the doomed wretch\r\nwas hurled into that vast space, beyond the reach of human eyes, his\r\nshrieks of horror growing fainter as he sank into death. While at the\r\nsame time, from the tree which he had grasped, and which shook as he\r\nfell, rose a flight of black cockatoos, mocking with their loud strange\r\ncries his fearful fate.\r\n\r\n\"Lord have mercy on him!\" exclaimed Jack, covering his face, and struck\r\nwith awe.\r\n\r\n\"It's a judgment, man,\" said Wilkins. \"Just see how this poor fellow is\r\nbleeding with the rogue's last will and deed.\"\r\n\r\nThe spear of Peter had entered the breast of the herdsman, who was\r\nbleeding profusely. Wilkins drew out the weapon, and Jack, seeing Ruth\r\nat his side, who had succeeded in reaching him in time to see the\r\ncatastrophe, despatched her in haste to the encampment, to send aid for\r\nthe wounded man.\r\n\r\nFearful of looking any longer at that dark and terrible grave of the\r\nsinful wretch, the girl tumbled down through the steep wood, and rushing\r\nup to Mr. Mayburn and Margaret, said, \"He's carried off alive! Them bad\r\nspirits,--them! them!--have flown away with Black Peter;\" and the\r\ndistracted girl positively shrieked as she pointed to a pair of harmless\r\nblack cockatoos perched on a fig-tree, which were curiously peering down\r\non the strange creatures below; and most assuredly the coal-black\r\nplumage, lofty crest, and fan tail, striped with bars of fiery scarlet,\r\ngave to the birds an unearthly and fiend-like appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Can anybody extract sense from the exclamations of this wild girl?\"\r\nasked Mr. Mayburn, much distressed. \"Ascertain, Margaret, how the\r\nwretched man has escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell ye,\" continued Ruth, with decision, \"I seed them black creaters,\r\nwi' my own eyes, take him up, and flee away wi' him, down into a black\r\npit; and poor Tom Atkinson's hit wi' a spear, and ye're to clamber up t'\r\nwood to doctor him.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the deduction drawn from Ruth's incoherent narrative was,\r\nthat the presence of some of the party was needed; and Mr. Deverell and\r\nMr. Mayburn, supplied with cold water and linen bandages, set out to\r\nclimb through the wood, on the beaten track of the pursued and the\r\npursuers; but before they had half ascended, they met with Wilkins and\r\nJack, bearing the wounded man with difficulty through the matted and\r\nsteep wood. When they were relieved by additional assistance, they soon\r\nreached the glen, and satisfied the anxiety of the perplexed family by a\r\ncorrect recital of the awful fate of the villanous bush-ranger.\r\n\r\n\"It's just what might have come to me, and I'd been but reet sarved,\"\r\nsaid Wilkins, \"if it hadn't been for ye all. I reckon it pleased God to\r\nsend ye, just o' purpose to bring round a good-to-naught chap, as not a\r\nsoul else would notish, or hauld out a finger to save. Poor reprobate!\r\nYe ken a deal of things, Miss Marget; can ye say what Peter was seeing\r\nafore him, when he yelled out, fleeing down into that black hole?\"\r\n\r\n\"God be merciful to the sinner!\" said Margaret. \"It is not for us,\r\nWilkins, to speak of that which God hides from us; but rather to\r\nprepare, that we may be ready for a sudden call to judgment.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the police returned with the fugitive, whom they\r\nhad overtaken and captured. He was now secured with the other two\r\nrangers, and Peter being disposed of, there was nothing to prevent the\r\npolice from proceeding with their prisoners to Sydney; and the guards\r\nand captives set out on their long journey, leaving the united party\r\nvery thankful for their separation from the wretched delinquents. The\r\nnext morning, after praying for a blessing on their expedition, the\r\nhappy friends set forward cheerfully, now safely guided by Edward\r\nDeverell, and hoping, before long, to reach the long-desired haven of\r\npeace and rest.\r\n\r\nBut many a day of toil and anxiety still succeeded: the privations of\r\nthe barren and dry desert, the perils of rude mountain-passes, and the\r\nfording deep and foaming rivers, besides the subtle and vindictive\r\npursuit of various unfriendly tribes of natives. At length they attained\r\nin safety the fertile banks of a broad and rapid river, which Mr.\r\nDeverell and his followers greeted with shouts of joy.\r\n\r\n\"My good Mr. Mayburn,\" said Edward Deverell, \"I call on you now to offer\r\nup a thanksgiving to Him who has led us in safety through the\r\nwilderness. This river is our guide and highway; it flows on to our own\r\nmuch-loved home; it is the blessing and ornament, dear Margaret, of\r\nDaisy Grange.\"\r\n\r\nAll joined with Christian earnestness in a thanksgiving for the mercies\r\nwhich even the lately awakened and reformed criminals could appreciate\r\nand understand; and Edward Deverell rejoiced to see that the two\r\nconvicts, Wilkins and Davy, would not be a dangerous addition to his\r\nlittle Christian community.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear friends,\" said Edward Deverell, \"we may trust that our\r\nprogress may be unimpeded. This fertile soil, watered by the river, will\r\nrestore our enfeebled cattle; then we shall have milk with our flour\r\ncakes, which, prepared by the skilful hand of Jenny, disdain fellowship\r\nwith the heavy 'damper' of the Australian traveller. If this abundant\r\nfood does not satisfy us, the trees will give us birds, and the river\r\nfish, to diversify our diet. Ought we not to rejoice?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, Mr. Deverell,\" said Jenny, \"yon's a bonnie flock of\r\ngeese; couldn't ye get us one for a roast?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must have more than one for our large party, Jenny,\" said Deverell,\r\nlaughing. \"Come, boys, let us have a shot at Jenny's geese, and secure\r\none specially for Mr. Mayburn's new museum.\"\r\n\r\nDelighted with the prospect of sport, the boys were soon ready, and\r\nreturned from the banks of the river with two pair of these large birds.\r\nEdward Deverell held out one of them to Jenny, saying, \"Now, my good\r\nwoman, can you tell me what this fowl is?\"\r\n\r\n\"A gray goose, Mr. Deverell, sure enough,\" answered Jenny. Then\r\nregarding it closely, she added, \"but it has a queer short neb, sir;\r\nit's like all things in this country, it's just unnat'ral.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nurse, it is no more a goose than you are,\" said Hugh; \"it is _rara\r\navis_, papa, that is,--a bird of Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recognize it with delight,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"from the description\r\nof Latham and later ornithologists, who class it as a new genus; and\r\nfrom the curious _cere_ which envelopes the base of the bill, he names\r\nit _Cereopsis_. Still it belongs to the swimming birds, though the legs\r\nare naked above the joint, and the membrane between the toes does not\r\nform the web foot. It is, therefore, less fitted for the water than the\r\ngoose or swan, and is more strictly a wader, living, not on fish, but\r\nvegetable food. In fact, it is a much handsomer bird than the goose, and\r\nI would gladly preserve it, if I had the means.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have means and opportunity at the Deverell station, my dear\r\nMr. Mayburn,\" said Edward. \"My brother Charles will supply the means,\r\nand assist you to form a museum; and Emma has domesticated a flock of\r\nthese birds, which in common parlance are known as the short-billed\r\ngeese; and I can assure you the flesh is most delicate, very unlike that\r\nof the common water-fowls which live on fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice much, Edward Deverell,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"that you concur\r\nwith me in admiring the works of nature,--a taste which I have\r\nendeavored to implant in my children. I remember the words of a clever\r\nwriter. 'To look on the creation with an eye of interest and feeling,\r\nmust be ever acceptable to the Creator. To trace out the several\r\nproperties of his works, and to study with diligence and humility their\r\nlaws, their uses, and operations, is an employment worthy the immortal\r\nmind of man; since it is one of those studies which we may reasonably\r\nhope will survive beyond the grave.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How delighted I am that dear little Emmy is taking the first steps of\r\nstudy in ornithology, by setting up a poultry-yard,\" said Hugh. \"We had\r\nmany disputes about waste of time in such useless pursuits, in which I\r\ndid not escape without much contumely for my bird lore. My generous\r\nretaliation shall be to improve her collection. I will get her the black\r\nswan, the talegalla, the apteryx....\"\r\n\r\n\"And the emu and ornithorhynchus would look well in the poultry-yard,\r\nHugh,\" said Gerald, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"That would be a great error, my dear boys,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"The\r\nhabits of the ornithorhynchus are directly opposed to the domestic\r\narrangements of the poultry-yard: it is not even a fowl; it is an\r\nunclassed animal, of burrowing and diving propensities, and would be a\r\ntroublesome, if not a dangerous, inmate among domestic fowls.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will leave it to Hugh and Emma to arrange the foreigners as they may\r\njudge best,\" said Mr. Deverell; \"but I know all our English fowls are\r\nfuriously national, and would resent the introduction of strangers, even\r\nto bloodshed. Even the civil wars of the community tax the patience of\r\nEmma and her handmaid Susan greatly; and she has threatened to reduce\r\ntheir numbers, now become enormous.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can supply her with an assistant poultry-maid,\" said Margaret; \"my\r\npoor Ruth is devotedly attached to fowls, and can manage them better\r\nthan she can do any thing else in the world. Ruth, would you not like to\r\nbe Mr. Deverell's poultry-woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to be amang 'em, bonnie creaters!\" answered Ruth, with\r\ngreat joy, \"if you be there Miss Marget, and if they be cocks and hens;\r\nand if them black fellows will not run off wi' them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our black neighbors are all tame, Ruth,\" answered Mr. Deverell. \"We\r\nemploy those who can be taught to work, clothe the women, and teach the\r\nchildren; and in times of scarcity or sickness, we feed and attend\r\nthem. As far as their ignorant and dull nature will allow, we have\r\nreason to think that gratitude or policy would prevent them from\r\ninjuring us or our property.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the bush-rangers,\" said Margaret; \"are you not ever in fear of the\r\ncrafty, vindictive bush-rangers?\"\r\n\r\n\"During our journey,\" answered Mr. Deverell, \"it is necessary that we\r\nshould be watchful; but our black police have reduced the number of\r\nthese vagabonds greatly, and our party is too formidable to be openly\r\ndefied. We must necessarily pass, now and then, one of those infamous,\r\nlonely, road-side bush-taverns, as they are called, at which these\r\nvillains are in the habit of congregating, that they may exchange their\r\nplunder for spirits and tobacco with the men at the station, who then\r\nforward the cattle to Sydney or to the gold-diggings. But our\r\npolice-followers are well acquainted with these detestable stations, and\r\nare always prepared for any assault. Above all, dear Margaret, we have a\r\nprecious charge, and think ourselves a band of brave fellows; every day\r\ndiminishes our danger, for it brings us nearer to our own inhabited\r\ngrounds, where the villains might venture to plunder secretly, but would\r\ncertainly not dare to show themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are your retainers spread about the estate?\" said Hugh. \"I thought\r\nyou intended to build a town.\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely aim so high, Hugh,\" replied Deverell. \"My stock-keepers are\r\nscattered over the cleared land in huts, to look after the cattle. I\r\nlive in my castle, like a feudal lord, surrounded by my vassals, who\r\nhave erected rude temporary huts. But if you will all agree to settle\r\nround me, we will really found a colony. I will make an application to\r\npurchase, instead of leasing, my immense tract of land. We will divide\r\nand cultivate it, which I never could do alone; and we will begin to\r\nbuild a handsome village, or perhaps two villages--one named Mayburn,\r\nand the other Deverell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, have you plenty of timber?\" asked Jack, roused at the\r\nprospect of work.\r\n\r\n\"You will see my woods and forests soon, Jack,\" answered Mr. Deverell.\r\n\"Then I have inexhaustible quarries of stone in the mountains, and some\r\ngood quarrymen and stonecutters on my establishment. We will have a\r\nregular English village, with a green for sports, and pleasant gardens\r\nto the cottages.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few days more they travelled pleasantly over the grassy turf; then\r\nthey came on almost impenetrable brushwood; and as this formidable\r\nobstacle to their progress would require vigor to overcome it, they\r\nencamped to spend the night, and commence their fatigue with the morning\r\nlight. But they found conversation and repose equally impossible, from\r\nthe disturbance caused by the restless movements and incessant bellowing\r\nof the cattle, which struggled to escape from the pens in which their\r\nattendants had confined them. Hugh went up to them with some curiosity,\r\nto know what was the cause of this unusual excitement amongst the quiet\r\ncreatures. The herdsmen were all grinning and rubbing their hands with\r\ngreat glee.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Patrick,\" said Deverell to one of the men, \"what is the jest that\r\nyou seem to enjoy so much?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the bastes, master,\" answered the man exultingly; \"they know where\r\nthey are, the craters! Don't they smell the smell of their own comrades,\r\nsinsible darlings! And it isn't the brush they'd mind if we were giving\r\nthem lave to it. Isn't it a short cut they'd make to come at them as is\r\nof their own blood! True old Irish they are, and illegant bastes.\r\nArrah, didn't them rogues see that when they came kidnapping? and didn't\r\nthey choose them out, in regard that there were no bastes to be seen\r\nlike them! Bad luck to the rappareens!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can it be possible,\" asked Margaret, \"that we are really so near to\r\nDaisy Grange that the animals scent it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are a long day's journey yet from Daisy Grange,\" answered Deverell;\r\n\"but it is true that we are not far from the borders of my extensive\r\nestate. This formidable thorny brushwood forms, in fact, the boundary\r\nand defence on this side, neither easy nor desirable to penetrate. A\r\nvery large portion of the interior of my land is not only uncultivated,\r\nbut is even unknown to me. We take care, however, to have\r\ncattle-stations and hut-keepers round the boundaries, that our rights\r\nmay be recognized and preserved; and doubtless these weary wanderers\r\nhave been stolen from one of the border stations, and now scent with\r\ngreat satisfaction their old companions, and their old quiet, luxurious\r\nhomes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I suppose we may conclude,\" said Gerald, \"that if we understood\r\nthe vaccine gamut, we should hear that big old red cow bellowing 'Home!\r\nsweet home!' And don't I wish we could join her, for I don't like the\r\nlook of that ugly scrub we shall have to carry our horses through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not altogether ugly,\" said Margaret; \"look at this curious and\r\ninteresting Banksia, with its stiff yellow robe; the white star-like\r\nblossoms of this shrub, which resembles our myrtle; and here is our old\r\nfriend the tea-shrub.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which Jenny will have to relinquish now,\" said Deverell, \"for the real\r\ntea of China, of which we have a goodly store. But, Jem, or some of you\r\nmen over there, be pleased to fire a shot or two to chase away those\r\nintolerable noisy dingoes, which, doubtless, like the ogre, smell fresh\r\nmeat, and would like to make a foray on our game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us shoot a dingo, Edward,\" said Hugh; \"I should like to look at the\r\nfellow closely.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is scarcely consistent with humanity,\" answered Deverell, \"to\r\ndestroy an animal that can be of no use to us; but we have an excuse in\r\nthe wolfish character of the dingo, which destroys our sheep in numbers,\r\nif not closely watched; and nothing affords my shepherds and herdsmen\r\nmore gratification than to trap or shoot one of these marauders.\" Hugh\r\nhad the gratification of shooting the _dingo_, or _warragle_, as\r\nBaldabella named it, and bringing it in for Arthur and his father to\r\ninspect. Margaret retired in disgust, the intolerable smell of the\r\nfierce-looking little animal was so offensive.\r\n\r\n\"From its destructive habits,\" said Mr. Mayburn, \"I should have expected\r\nto see a larger animal; but of its wolfish ferocity there seems no\r\ndoubt. It is remarkable that it is, unlike the land quadrupeds yet found\r\nin Australia, carnivorous, and not marsupial; thus confirming the theory\r\nthat the race of dogs is to be found in every known region of the world.\r\nThis dingo is a degraded representative of the noble animal, crafty,\r\nbloodthirsty, and untamable. I am satisfied with seeing this specimen,\r\nbut I cannot admire the creature.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the first gleam of day, while the moon yet lighted up the\r\nheavens, the impatient travellers set out to cross the bush; and for\r\nmore than two hours the long cavalcade wound with toil and difficulty\r\nthrough the tangled thorny bush. At length the lowing of other cattle\r\nthan their own greeted their ears, and the fresher breeze that came over\r\nthe cleared ground announced that they had passed the boundary, and were\r\nnow actually entering the domain of Mr. Deverell. In a short time the\r\nmingled and familiar cries of the drovers and their charge roused the\r\nfirst stock-man in his hut, who rushed out in great joy to welcome the\r\nreturn of the expedition.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir!\" said the man, \"I see they've picked out and made an end\r\nof the choicest of the stock; it's like their ways;\" and he grumbled out\r\nhis wishes that certain evil consequences might attend their unlawful\r\nfeasts on his chosen favorites, and concluded by caressing those which\r\nhad happily escaped being devoured by the robbers. He then proposed to\r\nsend forward one of the shepherds to announce the good news; but the\r\ntravellers, now relieved from the charge of the cattle, and having\r\npassed through the greatest difficulties of their journey, agreed to\r\nproceed forward without delay, and announce in their own persons the\r\nsuccess of the expedition at head-quarters.\r\n\r\nThey crossed a vast tract of wild and beautiful forest ground, which was\r\nstill uncleared, but at this season bright with rich flowers, and noisy\r\nwith the birds that thronged the tall trees; and continued to ride\r\nforward till the heat of the noonday sun compelled them to rest two\r\nhours most reluctantly in a shady grove. Then, once more mounting, they\r\nrode forward to enter on a new region. Before them lay spread large,\r\nwell-cultivated, fenced lands, stocked with sheep and cattle, and\r\ndotted here and there with the snug neat huts of the shepherds and\r\nstock-keepers; while the lowing and bleating of the animals, and the\r\ndistant barking of dogs, and sound of English voices, were music to the\r\ncharmed ears of the weary travellers. \"His name be praised!\" said Mr.\r\nMayburn, reverently uncovering his head, \"who has led us through the dry\r\nand barren wilderness to a land of plenty and peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole party were deeply affected at the first glimpse of home\r\nscenery and home sounds; but Deverell looked round with much anxiety\r\ntill he caught sight of a respectable-looking man riding among the\r\ncattle at a distance, whom he hailed, and the man rode forward in haste,\r\ncalling out, \"Welcome home, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Harris; but tell me, is all well at the Grange?\" asked\r\nDeverell.\r\n\r\n\"Charming, sir,\" answered he; \"saw them all this morning. Old mistress\r\nquite brisk, asking after the lambs; and Miss, throng with her poultry,\r\nand telling me to look after some grain for them. And here comes Mr.\r\nEdward, sir, to answer for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halloo! Charley,\" cried Edward, riding up to shake hands with his\r\nbrother, \"my good fellow, what have you been about, and what in the\r\nworld has induced you to bring the prisoners with you?\" and he looked\r\nwith suspicion and annoyance at the large party of distressed and ragged\r\nfollowers, who had purposely turned away from him. At last Margaret\r\nlooked round and smiled, and the delighted young fellow laughed with joy\r\nat seeing his old friends, and with amusement at their miserable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Margaret! my good friends!\" he exclaimed, \"I am quite wild with\r\nsurprise and pleasure. Never mind your ragged furbelows; little Emma is\r\na capital needlewoman, and will sew up all those great rents.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be a great blessing to me,\" said Margaret, laughing, \"to see a\r\nneedle again.\"\r\n\r\n\"A needle, Margaret!\" exclaimed Charles, \"we have millions of needles;\r\nEdward has a storehouse crammed with every thing that everybody can\r\nwant, under every circumstance. He could supply a large English country\r\ntown with goods; chests of needles, walls built up of paper, acres of\r\nthat muslin stuff you wear, so suitable to the thorny bush. Ask for what\r\nyou will, you can have it at Edward's grand bazaar.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, Mr. Charles,\" said Jack, \"do you think Mr. Edward has\r\nany tools?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have only to speak, Jack,\" answered he; \"we can supply you with the\r\nappliances of the arts, from a steam-engine to a delicate lancet. I am a\r\nclever shopman, and shall be happy to do the honors of the bazaar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Charles, you are a very troublesome and disorderly shopman,\"\r\nsaid his brother, \"as my store-keeper declares, creating vast confusion\r\namong his neatly-arranged shelves. Allowing for some exaggeration, my\r\ndear friends, Charles has told you the fact. I found my poor people had\r\nto pay so extravagantly for the little luxuries and necessaries of life\r\nthey required, either from the extortions of itinerant dealers, who are\r\ndangerous visitors to admit into a settlement, or from the expense of\r\njourneys to Sydney or Melbourne to make their purchases, that I resolved\r\nto supply them at moderate prices myself, which I am enabled to do by\r\nbringing wagon-loads of goods from Sydney, and furnishing a large\r\nstorehouse which I had built for the purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you not afraid of the bush-rangers being attracted by your\r\nvaluable storehouse?\" asked Mr. Mayburn.\r\n\r\n\"I have a clever-managing store-keeper, who, with his assistant, sleeps\r\nin the place, where they have arms, two fierce dogs, and an alarm-bell\r\nloud enough to rouse the whole hamlet. Besides, our bush-rangers prefer\r\nhighway robbery, or raids on the cattle, to the more dangerous attempts\r\nat house-breaking. You need fear no bush-rangers, my dear Mr. Mayburn,\r\nif you were once within the walls of my castle, where I trust to welcome\r\nyou speedily. Now I wish you to look at the beautiful variety of timber\r\ntrees which I have left standing as ornaments to my spacious park.\"\r\n\r\nIt was amongst these varied and extraordinary trees that the cavalcade\r\nwere now passing. Several varieties of the _Eucalyptus_ and the palm\r\ntribe, with their bare tall trunks and crested heads, were mingled with\r\nwhite or golden-blossomed acacias; the _Hibiscus_, peculiar to\r\nAustralia; the drooping grass-tree; and one spreading fig-tree stood\r\nlike a natural temple, with its pillar-like roots entwined with elegant\r\ncreeping plants, with a grace beyond the reach of art. Beneath these\r\ntrees the turf was resplendent with spring flowers, on which were\r\nquietly grazing flocks of white sheep, supplying the place of the\r\naristocratic deer. As they issued from the woodland upon a grassy glade,\r\nsloping gently to the banks of the river, Charles rode forward to\r\nannounce the glad tidings at Daisy Grange, which was now in sight on a\r\npretty eminence, backed by higher hills, which stretched beyond into\r\ngray mountains. As they rode slowly forward on their worn-out horses,\r\nMr. Mayburn was lost in admiration of the curious and happily-blended\r\ntrees, and Edward Deverell said,--\r\n\r\n\"The names given by the colonists to these new and remarkable trees are\r\npuzzling and inapplicable. This tree, named by them the red cedar, is\r\ncertainly not a cedar; though it is very useful, being our best timber\r\ntree, the wood resembling mahogany. The apple-tree bears no fruit, and\r\nhas no claim whatever to the tantalizing name. The rose-wood, so called\r\nfrom its delicate perfume, is a kind of _Meliaceæ_, the fruit of which\r\nis uneatable. Then we have the cherry, _Exocarpus_, the fruit of which\r\nis useless, and peculiarly unlike the dear old cherry of England, with\r\nwhich, however, I trust to regale you in a few months. I can already\r\ndiscover the white blossoms of the tree peeping over my garden walls;\r\nand I propose that we give these tired horses to the men, and walk up\r\nthe hill, that you may contemplate leisurely the imposing appearance of\r\nmy baronial hall.\"\r\n\r\nBut however Edward Deverell might depreciate his mansion, the distressed\r\nwanderers regarded its appearance with admiration and delight as they\r\npassed over the sloping lawn, laid out with excellent taste in\r\n_parterres_ of gay-colored flowers rising from the green turf, which was\r\nenamelled with the daisies of England; and saw the pretty house which\r\noffered them shelter after fifteen months of wandering.\r\n\r\nThe building, though entirely of wood, was picturesque and spacious. It\r\nwas surrounded by a large garden, beyond which were raised the large\r\nstorehouse; stables, and farm-buildings. Along the front of the house\r\nwas a broad veranda, supported by columns, entwined with roses,\r\nhoneysuckles, and the well-loved creeping flowers of England, now\r\nbursting into blossom; while the large portico was curtained with\r\ndraperies of the rich flowering climbers of Australia--the convolvulus,\r\nthe curious passion-flower, and other graceful unknown plants, to\r\nstimulate the curiosity of the botanists.\r\n\r\nBut it was not at this moment that all the beauties of the Grange were\r\nobserved, for the hospitable doors stood open, and the agitated party\r\nwere hurried into the cool and spacious hall, where Mrs. Deverell and\r\nher smiling daughter waited to welcome Edward and his unexpected\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Comforts of Civilization.--Susan Raine.--The Hamlet and the\r\nChurch.--Plans for the Future.--Mrs. Edward Deverell.--The Beauties of\r\nDaisy Grange.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the reception was great: such screams of wonder and\r\ndelight! so many tears at the thoughts of the trials and sufferings of\r\nthe wanderers and so much laughter at their tattered condition! Then\r\nsucceeded such haste and bustle to procure immediate aid to restore to\r\nthem the comforts of which they had been so long deprived, and to spread\r\nthe hospitable board with the refreshments so long untasted.\r\n\r\nIt was only by interjections and extorted answers that any details of\r\ntheir trials were known at first. It was necessary that they should be\r\nrestored to the likeness of civilized beings; and the servants vied with\r\ntheir master and mistress in providing food and raiment for the needy.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, dear Emma,\" said Margaret, as she brushed her dishevelled hair\r\nand arrayed herself in a clean muslin dress belonging to her\r\nfriend,--\"tell me if you have still, and unmarried, the pretty\r\ndairy-maid, Susan Raine, who accompanied you from England. One of our\r\nfaithful attendants, though rude and unpolished, will be broken-hearted\r\nif he does not find his Susan here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, Margaret,\" answered Emma, \"you are not speaking of the\r\ngraceless convict, Wilkins? You alarm me, for the good girl has told me\r\nher whole history; and, though she is unwilling to allow it, there is\r\nno doubt the man behaved basely in inducing her to come over from\r\nEngland to join him, only to find the worthless fellow had absconded.\"\r\n\r\n\"But let me explain his conduct to you, Emma,\" said Margaret; \"let me\r\ntell you his story of sins and repentance and then I hope you will\r\nconsent to be his mediator and friend.\"\r\n\r\nThen, before they descended to join the rest, Margaret told her friend\r\nall the circumstances of Wilkins's temptation, fall, and happy\r\nreformation after having been thrown amongst them; and this was the\r\nfirst part of the adventures of the travellers that was related at Daisy\r\nGrange. And when the girls told Mrs. Deverell this tale of trials, she\r\npromised that Susan, who was now engaged in the dairy, should have the\r\nunexpected event properly revealed to her before she was introduced to\r\nher much-lamented friend.\r\n\r\nThe travellers scarcely recognized each other in their amended\r\nappearance, for which they had been indebted to the wardrobes of their\r\nfriends; and they now proceeded to the large dining-room, where the\r\ntable was spread with the plenty of an English home. Beef and mutton\r\nfrom the fields; fowls from the poultry-yard; pastry made by Emma; fruit\r\nand vegetables from the garden, and cream from the dairy. To these\r\nhomely luxuries was added home-brewed ale from the barley grown on the\r\nsettlement, which Edward Deverell said must satisfy his guests for some\r\ntime, till his vines produced him grapes fit to make wine.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Jenny and Ruth, with Baldabella and her child, had been\r\nproperly cared for by the maid-servants of the establishment, who were\r\nin exuberant spirits at the novelty of visitors, and especially such\r\nwonderful and amusing visitors, who could tell them such strange tales\r\nof their travels; and even Baldabella in time got over her shyness,\r\nunder the pressing hospitality of the reception; and little Nakinna was\r\nin ecstasies at the novelties she beheld and the dainties which she now\r\nfirst tasted. Wilkins moped in a corner in deep distress till his friend\r\nHugh came to him, who insisted on his shaving and dressing himself\r\nneatly, and who then accompanied him to the dairy, where Susan, already\r\nacquainted with his story by Emma, was sitting weeping, but quite ready\r\nto receive and pardon the repentant man; and the mirth and festivity of\r\nthe servants' hall were complete when the reunited pair joined the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIt was late before the wanderers had recounted their adventures; and\r\nthey all fully enjoyed the luxury of beds, after being so long\r\naccustomed to the open air, though the boys declared sleeping in an\r\nenclosed room was rather confining. Next morning, after a breakfast of\r\ncoffee and cream, with all the other good things of the farm, they set\r\nout to see the hamlet, which was to become in time the town of Deverell.\r\nThis hamlet stood about a quarter of a mile from the Grange, and\r\nconsisted of a long row of wooden huts, thatched with bark, and painted\r\ngreen; each stood apart in a pretty garden, and each had behind it about\r\nan acre of land fenced round, where a cow, and sometimes a sheep or two,\r\nwere grazing; every thing looked clean, orderly, and prosperous.\r\n\r\nFrom the cottages to the river it was not more than three or four\r\nhundred yards, and before them was a green, in the midst of which was an\r\nenclosure that contained a neat stone-built church, with its low tower\r\nand bell to summon the congregation to church.\r\n\r\nMr. Mayburn was moved even to tears at the sight of this temple of God\r\nin the remote wilds; he seized the hand of Deverell, and said, \"May\r\nHeaven bless you, my son! tell me whom you expect to fulfil the duties\r\nof this holy place.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have but just completed the most difficult and important work we\r\nhave yet undertaken,\" answered Deverell. \"The stone has been brought\r\nfrom our own quarry; but the labor of cutting and building was great and\r\ntedious. Our people are, however, pious and industrious, and they gladly\r\nworked extra hours to raise the place of worship they pined for. I have\r\never proposed to wait for you to be our priest, my good father; and\r\nmonth after month I have expected letters from you. For some of the\r\ngraceless crew of the _Golden Fairy_, who escaped in the boats, reached\r\nAdelaide; and when they reported the vessel to be destroyed by fire,\r\nthey asserted that you and your family had been taken up by an Indiaman.\r\nMy plan was, as soon as I had heard from you where you were settled, to\r\nwrite to beseech you to join me. It is only during the last month that,\r\nafflicted and disappointed by your long silence, I have reluctantly\r\nturned my thoughts to the necessity of searching for another minister;\r\nand I was on the eve of setting out on a long journey to consult our\r\nworthy bishop, when the raid of the bush-rangers called me away to\r\nrecover my property. Now Heaven has sent you to us, may I not, then,\r\nventure to hope that you are ours for life?\"\r\n\r\n\"For life, Edward Deverell,\" answered Mr. Mayburn. \"I am content and\r\nhappy to remain with you; and I feel sure my children are determined to\r\ndo the same. Teach them to be useful and happy as you are; and allow us\r\nto form part of your new colony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huzza!\" cried Hugh; \"but you must grant us allotments to build cottages\r\non, Governor Deverell.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear all my plans,\" answered Deverell. \"In the first place,\r\nyou must all be our guests till dwellings are provided; the Grange is\r\nlarge enough for a city hotel. We will begin by building a handsome\r\nmanse for our worthy pastor, with a large and convenient museum, which\r\neverybody must try to furnish with wonderful birds and eggs, and all the\r\nnatural curiosities of Australia. I can spare volumes of my own to fit\r\nup the library, till we can procure all that are needed from Sydney.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delightful!\" said Margaret. \"I long to see you begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must have a house and workshop for our friend Jack,\" continued\r\nDeverell; \"and constitute him head carpenter of Deverell. On your\r\nrecommendation, I will venture to employ Wilkins as a stock-keeper; he\r\nshall be placed at the dairy-house, which the prudent Susan shall\r\nmanage; and they shall have a good allotment, with cows and pigs of\r\ntheir own, to encourage them to prudence and industry. As for your\r\nfemale followers, Nurse Wilson, Ruth, and the native woman and child,\r\nthey must remain with us, at least till the parsonage-house is\r\ncompleted, and Mr. Mayburn wishes to found his household.\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose, Edward,\" said Margaret, \"that, if you do not object, I\r\nshould teach some of the little girls of the hamlet--I see you have a\r\nnumber who are peeping at us from the cottages; then Nakinna will learn\r\nwith them, and soon be a little English girl in all but complexion.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just what I expected from you, Margaret,\" answered Deverell;\r\n\"and Emma will be delighted to have such an associate. On this pretty\r\nspot, my brother Charles proposes to build a good house for himself,\r\nthat he may be near his patients, who, I am happy to say, are few. He\r\nintends, when his house is ready, to go down to Sydney, and bring thence\r\na wife to preside over it. He has fixed on a very charming young orphan\r\ngirl, who, with her two young sisters that will accompany her, will form\r\na most agreeable addition to our society.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite right,\" said Mr. Mayburn. \"I rejoice to hear of his\r\nintention. And you, my dear Edward--would it not be also desirable that\r\nyou should bring some lady suitable to you to this pleasant abode? If\r\nyou have really resolved to pass your days here, it is your duty to\r\nmarry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so, my very dear friend?\" answered Deverell. \"Then I leave\r\nthe affair in your hands; you must kindly select a bride for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, my dear Edward!\" exclaimed Mr. Mayburn. \"I that have ever lived so\r\nmuch out of the world, and that am now a perfect solitary. I am actually\r\nacquainted with no young ladies in the world but your sister and my own\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, papa,\" said Gerald archly, \"Edward would be satisfied to take\r\nMargaret.\"\r\n\r\n\"How exceedingly absurd you can be, my dear boy,\" said Mr. Mayburn;\r\nthen, after a few minutes' consideration, he added: \"The thought never\r\noccurred to me before; it is not an absurd idea. I really do not see\r\nwhy such a pleasant arrangement might not be.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret fled from the delicate discussion, and Edward Deverell then\r\nassured Mr. Mayburn, that not only he should be satisfied to take\r\nMargaret, but that he had never thought of any other person; as\r\neverybody but Mr. Mayburn understood long ago.\r\n\r\nThen Margaret had to be asked if she would consent to be the mistress of\r\nthat comfortable and happy household, to which she agreed, providing\r\nMrs. Deverell and Emma would still continue to share the pleasures and\r\nduties of her home. And Edward told her all his plans for extending the\r\npopulation of his colony, and regulating it according to the laws of\r\nEngland and the commands of God. The great hall was, when needed, a hall\r\nof justice, and his people knew they were amenable to the law as much as\r\nif they lived in England.\r\n\r\n\"You should see how grave I look when I am seated on my throne of\r\noffice, Margaret,\" said Deverell: \"I must have Mr. Mayburn and Arthur on\r\nthe bench in future, to give more dignity to my court. And now I must\r\nshow you a domain which will be especially your own--my gardens,\r\norchards and vineyards.\"\r\n\r\nNo labor or expense had been spared to enrich the gardens with all the\r\nfairest products of Australia and England. Conservatories and hot-houses\r\nwere not needed in this charming climate, where the most delicate\r\nflowers and choicest fruits reached perfection in the open air. The rich\r\nblossoms of the apple, peach, apricot, and nectarine were now glowing on\r\nevery side, and the trees, though so young, gave promise of abundant\r\nfruit; and the fragrance of the strawberry beds proclaimed the fruit to\r\nbe ripe. Margaret was delighted with all she saw, and astonished at the\r\nthought of the labor and perseverance that must have been used.\r\n\r\nA long avenue was shaded with the broad and luxuriant leaves of the\r\nvine, on which small bunches of grapes were already formed, a young\r\ncrop, but giving promise of the rich vintage future years would bring.\r\n\r\n\"When my vines have reached maturity,\" said Deverell, \"I shall require\r\nall the heads and the hands I can command, in order to make good wine\r\nfrom my own vineyard, of which, if God spare me, I have no fear. And I\r\nhope, Margaret, you are pleased with the delicate and fragrant blossoms\r\nof my orange-trees. They are yet but low shrubs; but I trust we shall\r\nlive to see them tall and productive trees.\"\r\n\r\nBut it required many pleasant days, and many rambles about the domain,\r\nto see all that had been done, and all that it was proposed to do. Mr.\r\nMayburn's new dwelling was planned and immediately commenced, orchards\r\nand gardens were marked out, and a list of fruit-trees and seeds made\r\nout. Jack was in his element, superintending the cutting down of timber\r\ntrees, and then manufacturing them into tables and chairs, and other\r\nuseful furniture, to his heart's content.\r\n\r\n\"It's a great comfort, Mr. Arthur,\" said he, as his three young friends\r\nstood near him in his new workshop. \"It's a great comfort to have a good\r\nchest of tools again, and that thief, Peter, no longer here to make off\r\nwith them; and to be working at good jobs that we shall not have to run\r\naway and leave behind us, as we had to do when those ugly black fellows\r\nwere always hanging at our heels.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Jack,\" answered Hugh, \"do you know that Mr. Deverell has a number\r\nof those black fellows employed on his estate, who not only wear clothes\r\nand live in huts, but speak English, behave quietly and honestly, and\r\nattend prayers regularly with the other work-people. Baldabella is very\r\nglad to meet with the native women, who are not _jins_ here, but wives;\r\nshe certainly holds herself a little above them, but she condescends to\r\nteach them decorum and the manners of society. We are all to be employed\r\nin the schools immediately, and then you will see what wonders papa and\r\nArthur and Margaret will effect among these poor natives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Master Hugh,\" answered Jack, with a certain air of incredulity,\r\n\"I hope, by God's help, it may turn out as you say; but you'll not get\r\nWilkins to believe such a thing. He hates blacks like toads, and always\r\ndid. There's Susan, however, she is a quiet, good lass; but she has a\r\ngood spirit, and maybe she may win her good man to think better of them.\r\nBut, Mr. Arthur, now you are at your proper work among books, and Master\r\nHugh and Master Gerald, they'll be riding about on the land, I shall not\r\nsee much of you; there's no need for any of you to take up a hammer\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your workshop will always be a favorite resort, depend on it, Jack,\"\r\nsaid Arthur; \"but I am going to read hard for the next year, to make up\r\nfor lost time. Then papa intends me to go to England, to be entered at\r\none of the universities.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to return to us the Reverend Arthur Mayburn,\" said Gerald, \"ready\r\nto help papa, and, I should say, to marry little Emma.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shall always come and help you, Jack, when I have time,\" said\r\nHugh; \"we should all be mechanics here, in case of vicissitudes. My\r\nparticular pursuit will be to study medicine with Charles Deverell, to\r\nbe fitted for the second doctor when our colony shall be so much\r\nincreased that two are required. Gerald is to be farmer, and hunter, and\r\ngame-keeper, and ornithological assistant to papa; and then, I think,\r\nJack, we shall form such a pleasant, cosy family circle, that we shall\r\nnone of us feel any inclination 'to take to the bush.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell to the cowardly bush-rangers,\" said Gerald. \"They never dare\r\nface such a band of heroes. I shall be head ranger myself; and on grand\r\noccasions I shall call you all around me for a field-day, to beat the\r\nbushes, and keep up our character of successful Kangaroo Hunters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD AND POPULAR BOOKS\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\nPORTER & COATES, PHILADELPHIA, PA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAVERLEY NOVELS.

He has revived the novel of\r\ngenuine practical life, as it existed in the works of Fielding,\r\nSmollett, and Goldsmith; but at the same time has given to his material\r\nan individual coloring and expression peculiarly his own. His\r\ncharacters, like those of his great exemplars, constitute a world of\r\ntheir own, whose truth to nature every reader instinctively recognizes\r\nin connection with their truth to darkness.\"--_E.

By JOEL COOK, author of \"A Holiday\r\nTour in Europe,\" etc. With 487 finely engraved illustrations,\r\ndescriptive of the most famous and attractive places, as well as of the\r\nhistoric scenes and rural life of England and Wales. With Mr. Cook's\r\nadmirable descriptions of the places and the country, and the splendid\r\nillustrations, this is the most valuable and attractive book of the\r\nseason, and the sale will doubtless be very large. 4vo.

There are few satisfactory works about this land\r\nwhich is so generously gifted by Nature and so full of memorials of the\r\npast. Such books as there are, either cover a few counties or are\r\ndevoted to special localities, or are merely guide-books. The present\r\nwork is believed to be the first attempt to give in attractive form a\r\ndescription of the stately homes, renowned castles, ivy-clad ruins of\r\nabbeys, churches, and ancient fortresses, delicious scenery, rock-bound\r\ncoasts, and celebrated places of England and Wales. It is written by an\r\nauthor fully competent from travel and reading, and in position to\r\nproperly describe his very interesting subject; and the artist's pencil\r\nhas been called into requisition to graphically illustrate its\r\nwell-written pages. There are 487 illustrations, prepared in the highest\r\nstyle of the engraver's art, while the book itself is one of the most\r\nattractive ever presented to the American public.\r\n\r\nIts method of construction is systematic, following the most convenient\r\nroutes taken by tourists, and the letter-press includes enough of the\r\nhistory and legend of each of the places described to make the story\r\nhighly interesting. Its pages fairly overflow with picture and\r\ndescription, telling of everything attractive that is presented by\r\nEngland and Wales. Executed in the highest style of the printer's and\r\nengraver's art, \"England, Picturesque and Descriptive,\" is one of the\r\nbest American books of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA. By the COMTE DE PARIS. With Maps\r\nfaithfully Engraved from the Originals, and Printed in Three Colors.\r\n8vo. Cloth, per volume, $3.50; red cloth, extra, Roxburgh style, uncut\r\nedges, $3.50; sheep, library style, $4.50; half Turkey morocco, $6.00.\r\nVols I, II, and III now ready.\r\n\r\nThe third volume embraces, without abridgment, the fifth and sixth\r\nvolumes of the French edition, and covers one of the most interesting as\r\nwell as the most anxious periods of the war, describing the operations\r\nof the Army of the Potomac in the East, and the Army of the Cumberland\r\nand Tennessee in the West.\r\n\r\nIt contains full accounts of the battle of Chancellorsville, the attack\r\nof the monitors on Fort Sumter, the sieges and fall of Vicksburg and\r\nPort Hudson; the battles of Port Gibson and Champion's Hill, and the\r\nfullest and most authentic account of the battle of Gettysburg ever\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n\"The head of the Orleans family has put pen to paper with excellent\r\nresult.... Our present impression is that it will form by far the best\r\nhistory of the American war.\"--_Athenæum, London._\r\n\r\n\"We advise all Americans to read it carefully, and judge for themselves\r\nif 'the future historian of our war,' of whom we have heard so much, be\r\nnot already arrived in the Comte de Paris.\"--_Nation, New York._\r\n\r\n\"This is incomparably the best account of our great second revolution\r\nthat has yet been even attempted. It is so calm, so dispassionate, so\r\naccurate in detail, and at the same time so philosophical in general,\r\nthat its reader counts confidently on finding the complete work\r\nthoroughly satisfactory.\"--_Evening Bulletin, Philadelphia._\r\n\r\n\"The work expresses the calm, deliberate judgment of an experienced\r\nmilitary observer and a highly intelligent man. Many of its statements\r\nwill excite discussion, but we much mistake if it does not take high and\r\npermanent rank among the standard histories of the civil war. Indeed\r\nthat place has been assigned it by the most competent critics both of\r\nthis country and abroad.\"--_Times, Cincinnati._\r\n\r\n\"Messrs. Porter & Coates, of Philadelphia, will publish in a few days\r\nthe authorized translation of the new volume of the Comte de Paris'\r\nHistory of Our Civil War. The two volumes in French--the fifth and\r\nsixth--are bound together in the translation in one volume. Our readers\r\nalready know, through a table of contents of these volumes, published in\r\nthe cable columns of the _Herald_, the period covered by this new\r\ninstallment of a work remarkable in several ways. It includes the most\r\nimportant and decisive period of the war, and the two great campaigns of\r\nGettysburg and Vicksburg.\r\n\r\n\"The great civil war has had no better, no abler historian than the\r\nFrench prince who, emulating the example of Lafayette, took part in this\r\nnew struggle for freedom, and who now writes of events, in many of which\r\nhe participated, as an accomplished officer, and one who, by his\r\nindependent position, his high character and eminent talents, was placed\r\nin circumstances and relations which gave him almost unequalled\r\nopportunities to gain correct information and form impartial judgments.\r\n\r\n\"The new installment of a work which has already become a classic will\r\nbe read with increased interest by Americans because of the importance\r\nof the period it covers and the stirring events it describes. In advance\r\nof a careful review we present to-day some extracts from the advance\r\nsheets sent us by Messrs. Porter & Coates, which will give our readers a\r\nforetaste of chapters which bring back to memory so many half-forgotten\r\nand not a few hitherto unvalued details of a time which Americans of\r\nthis generation at least cannot read of without a fresh thrill of\r\nexcitement.\"",
