This was corn or maize the kernels of which were denuded\r\nof their \"hulls\" by the chemical action of alkalies, which, however,\r\nimpaired the sweetness of the food. Hominy is corn deprived of the\r\nhulls by mechanical means leaving the corn with all its original flavor\r\nunimpaired. Hominy is a favorite dish throughout the country, but is not\r\nalways entirely free from particles of the outer skin of the kernels.\r\nThe mill shown in perspective in the engraving is intended to obviate\r\nthis objection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DONALDSON'S PATENT HOMINY MILL.]\r\n\r\nThe corn is placed in the hopper, A, from which it is fed to the hulling\r\ncylinder contained in the case, B. The hulling machinery is driven by\r\na belt on the pulley, C, the other end of the shaft of which carries\r\na pinion which gives motion to the gear wheel, D. This, by means of a\r\npinion on the shaft of the blower, E, drives the fans of the blower. On\r\nthe other, or front end of the shaft which carries the gear, D, is a\r\nbevel gear by which another bevel gear and worm is turned. The worm\r\nrotates the worm gear, F, in two opposite arms of which are slots that\r\ncarry pins projecting inwards, which may be moved toward or away from\r\nthe center. This gear wheel turns free on the shaft that carries the\r\npulley, C, and is intended for opening, by means of the pins in the\r\narms and levers, a cover in the bottom of the hopper and a valve in the\r\nbottom of the hulling cylinder. Coiled or bent springs return these\r\nlevers or valves to place when the pin which moves them has passed.\r\n\r\nA wrist-pin on the gear, D, forms a crank which is connected to a bar\r\nat the rear end of the sieves, G, pivoted to an arm at H, by which the\r\nsieves have a shaking or reciprocating motion as the machine operates.\r\nThe blower drives out the hulls and the motion of the sieves with their\r\ninclined position insure access of the air to every portion of the\r\nhominy.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the connection of all the parts is absolute. The\r\nmotion of the sieves, the speed of the blower, and the action of the\r\ninlet hopper valve and the delivery hulling valve are always exactly\r\nproportioned to the speed of the hulling cylinder, whether fast or slow.\r\nThe upper or feed valve opens upward and has a downward projecting lip\r\nthat shuts into a recess in its seat which insures security against\r\nleakage from the hopper to the hulling cylinder during the intervals of\r\nits being raised; a great advantage in hominy making, as no grain ought\r\nto get into the batch until that in the cylinder is done.\r\n\r\nPatented Oct. 15, 1867, by John Donaldson, who may be addressed for\r\nfurther information at Rockford, Ill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNitro-Glycerin.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Doremus of this city was called as a witness at the inquest\r\nupon the bodies of the unfortunate persons killed by the recent\r\nexplosion at Bergen, N.J. The Professor having previously analyzed some\r\nof the explosive mixture, testified as follows:--\"I have subjected it\r\nto chemical analysis, and find it to correspond to the formula C_{6},\r\nH_{3}, O_{3}, and NO_{5}; it is well made nitro-glycerin; the substance\r\nfreezes at about 46; it is made to decompose in a very peculiar way; on\r\nmoistening paper with it it burns with rapidity; it does not explode\r\nwhen red-hot copper is placed in it; we tried it with the most intense\r\nheat--we can produce with a galvanic battery with two hundred cells\r\nholding a gallon and a half each; some nitro-glycerin was placed in a\r\ncup and connected with one of the poles of the battery; through a pencil\r\nof gas carbon the other poles of the battery were connected with the\r\nglycerin, no explosion ensued; but when the point touched the britannia\r\nvessel the nitro-glycerin took fire, a portion burning and the rest\r\nscattering about; this is as severe a test as we can submit it to in the\r\nway of heat under the pressure of the air; we therefore would conclude\r\nthat nitro-glycerin carried about exposed cannot explode, even if you\r\ndrop a coal of fire into it; if the liquid is confined, or is under\r\npressure, then an explosion will ensue; if paper be moistened with\r\nit and put on an anvil and a smart blow given with a hammer, a sharp\r\ndetonation ensues; if gunpowder or the fulminates of mercury, silver or\r\ngun-cotton be ignited in a vacuum by a galvanic battery, none of them\r\nwill explode; if any gas be introduced so as to produce a gentle\r\npressure during the decomposition, then a rapid evolution of gases will\r\nresult; the results of decomposition in a vacuum differ from those under\r\natmospheric pressure or when they are burnt in a pistol, musket,\r\na cannon, or in a mine; where we have little or no pressure it is\r\ndifficult to get these substances to burn rapidly; nitro-glycerin is\r\nmore difficult to explode than powder; in many respects it resembles\r\ngun-cotton which is made in a similar way; if gun-cotton be immersed\r\nin the proto-chloride of iron it turns into common cotton; the\r\nsame experiment was tried with nitro-glycerin by mixing it with\r\nproto-chloride of iron, and it reverted into common glycerin; there\r\nare four well known varieties of gun-cotton made by employing acids of\r\ndifferent strengths; they differ in chemical composition and properties,\r\nas well as in their explosive qualities; the late Minister of War in\r\nAustria in 1862 stated to me that he had ordered four hundred cannon for\r\ngun-cotton, and six months after he stated that he had ordered all\r\nthe cannon to be changed and adapted to powder, in consequence of\r\nspontaneous combustions; much less is known of nitro-glycerin than of\r\ngun-cotton, and probably several varieties of this article may be formed\r\nas of gun cotton; this would explain cases of spontaneous explosion; if\r\nthe nitro-glycerin is not carefully washed to get rid of the acid, a\r\ngradual decomposition will ensue, producing gases, which, if the vessel\r\nbe closed, will explode; my opinion is that nitro-glycerin should be\r\nused in the most careful hands; do not think I would put it in the hands\r\nof a common laborer for blasting purposes; it is less dangerous in a\r\nfrozen than a liquid state; I think concussion would explode frozen\r\nnitro-glycerin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISERT'S ADJUSTABLE CULTIVATOR TOOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the device exhibited in the engraving is to allow the\r\nteeth of a cultivator to turn slightly and avoid obstructions, while\r\nthey will follow at all times the line of draft, so that in turning the\r\ncultivator there is no risk of breaking the teeth or their shanks, or\r\nof overturning the implement. The cultivator blade, A, may be of any\r\ndesired form, and it is secured to the curved shank, B, which is pivoted\r\nby a bolt to the beam, C. On the under or lower side of the beam is an\r\niron plate, D, having a projecting socket, E, which is the stud or pin\r\non which the eye of the shank turns. A bolt passing through the socket\r\nand beam holds the shank in place. Farmers will readily perceive the\r\nadvantages of this device. It may be applied to any or all of the\r\ndifferent cultivators now in use. Patented Sept 3, 1867, by B.F. Hisert\r\nwho may be addressed for rights to make or sell at Norton Hill, Green\r\nCo., N.Y., or address G.W. King, Scoharie, N.Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemedy for Cold Feet in City Cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Riding down town these cold mornings in the horse cars, the unpleasant\r\nsensation of chilled feet reminds us of the plan adopted in France and\r\nother parts of Europe to keep the feet of car passengers warm. This is\r\naccomplished by inserting a flattened iron tube along the bottom of the\r\ncar lengthwise in the center, between the rows of seats. This tube is\r\nraised a little above the floor level of the car to afford a rest for\r\nthe feet, yet, not enough to make a stumbling block. When the car leaves\r\nthe depot this tube is filled with hot water from a boiler kept heated\r\nfor the purpose, and this water retains its heat and gives a pleasant\r\nwarmth to the feet of the passengers and the car generally, for about\r\ntwo hours, after which the tube is refilled at a convenient station on\r\nthe road. In the case of our city cars this might easily be done, and be\r\na cheap and exceedingly comfortable improvement.\"--_Evening Post_.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that the French cars are arranged with small\r\ncompartments like stage coaches, and the passengers sit face to face,\r\nwith the warming tube above described under their feet. One tube\r\nfor every six persons. We should be glad, indeed, to see this plan\r\nintroduced here. But it is not to be expected that our city railroad\r\ncompanies will do anything for the comfort of their passsengers, while\r\nwithout such trouble they continue to reap rich harvests. Very likely\r\nthe idea of loading a lot of hot water upon their cars, for passengers\r\nto stand upon, would strike them as a good joke. Their poor, broken\r\ndown, spavined horses, could not stand any additional load.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Your Money Back.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French are a curious people and one of the novelties of Parisian\r\nenterprises is a large warehouse, in which are sold, at retail, all\r\nmanner of goods, from a diamond necklace to a shoe brush. The purchaser,\r\nhaving paid the price, receives not only the goods, but a bond for the\r\nwhole amount of his purchase money, payable, after thirty years, and\r\nguaranteed by the Credit Foncier and other moneyed corporations. The\r\nprices charged are said to be no greater than in any other retail shops.\r\nThis is really eating your cake in order to keep it; the more you\r\nspend the richer you will be; indeed it sets at defiance the whole of\r\nFranklin's code of proverbs, and proves \"Poor Richard\" a silly fellow.\r\nImagine Jones lecturing his wife on her economy, and reproaching her for\r\na spirit of saving, \"My dear, if you had bought this camel's hair shawl\r\nthirty years ago, it would now be a source of income to us; if you\r\nhad not been so close we should now be wealthy.\" Smith acquires an\r\nindependence by giving his children an expensive education, and sees in\r\nevery new dress or costly jewel which his growing daughters wear, a new\r\nmine of wealth for himself. If he can only persuade them to spend money\r\nenough he is sure of a support in his old age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA GIGANTIC BRIDGE.--A suspension bridge is to be erected by M. Oudry,\r\nengineer, over the Straits of Messina, Sicily, from Point Pezzo, on the\r\nCalabrian Coast. It is to consist of four spans of 3,281 feet each,\r\nelevated about 150 feet above high-water level, so that the largest\r\nships may pass under. The proposed Roebling bridge over the East River,\r\nbetween New York and Brooklyn, is to have a single span of 1,600 feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe through mails to the West now go in iron-bound boxes instead of\r\nleathern bags. Each box, tightly packed, contains about eight hundred\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first steam vessel used in Great Britain was called the _Comet_, and\r\nbuilt by Henry Bell in 1812.

Probably no publication extent will furnish a more\r\ncomplete and exhaustive exhibit of the progress of science and the arts\r\nin this country for the past twenty-two years than a complete file of\r\nthe SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. It is a curious and interesting pastime to\r\ncompare the condition of the mechanic arts as presented in some of our\r\nfirst volumes with that shown in our more recent ones. During all this\r\ntime, nearly a quarter of a century, our journal has endeavored to\r\nrepresent the actual condition of our scientific and mechanical progress\r\nand to record the discoveries and improvements in these departments\r\nwherever made. The result is a compendium of valuable information\r\nunattainable through any other means.\r\n\r\nBut the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has aimed not only to gratify a laudable\r\ncuriosity by collecting and presenting such information, but to give\r\npractical knowledge which could be applied to valuable uses.\r\n\r\nWe labor for the producers--the mechanics, farmers, laborers--those who\r\nbuild up a country and make the wilderness to blossom like the rose. We\r\nbelieve that the workers are the power, especially in this country; and\r\nwhile we do not wish to detract from the value of the products of merely\r\nintellectual speculators, we still think that the world needs specially\r\nthe laborer. We use the term \"laborer\" in this connection in its widest\r\nsense, comprehending he who uses brain as well as he who employs muscle;\r\nscientific investigation and discovery should be followed by and united\r\nto practical application.\r\n\r\nThe improvement exhibited in our past volumes will be no less noticeable\r\nhereafter. Keeping pace with the \"march of mind\" we shall endeavor\r\nalways to lead rather than to follow. The different departments of our\r\npaper are managed by those who are practically acquainted with the\r\nsubjects they profess to elucidate. \"To err is human,\" but we shall\r\nspare no pains nor expense to make the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN as reliable\r\nin its statements as it is interesting in the variety and matter of its\r\nsubjects. There are none of our people, from the student or professional\r\nman to the day laborer, but will find something in every number, of\r\npresent or future value to him in his business.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHANGE AT THE PATENT OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.C. Theaker has resigned as Commissioner of Patents. A number of\r\ngentlemen are mentioned as candidates for the succession, prominent\r\namong whom are B. T. James and Charles Mason. Mr. James has acted in the\r\ncapacity of primary Examiner in the Engineering Class for a number of\r\nyears, and has filled his position acceptably. Judge Mason held the\r\nCommissionership from 1853 to 1857, and his whole administration was\r\nmarked with reform and ability. Judge Mason was educated at West Point,\r\nand he is a man of sterling integrity, a sound jurist, experienced in\r\npatent law, and a splendid executive officer. One thing may be relied\r\nupon, if Judge Mason should receive and accept the appointment of\r\nCommissioner, inventors will not have to complain long of delay in the\r\nexamination of their cases The Judge is as industrious by nature as he\r\nis stern and systematic by education and he will have no drones about\r\nhim. The work of the office under his administration would be brought up\r\nand kept up.\r\n\r\nA good day for inventors and all persons having business with the Patent\r\nOffice will dawn when Judge Mason takes the Commissioner's chair again,\r\nand we hope the proper influences may be brought to bear to secure his\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBITUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEbenezer Winship, died at his home in this city Dec. 6, 1867, at the age\r\nof 67. A long and eminently useful although unobtrusive life entitles\r\nhis memory to respect. He commenced his career as a mechanic in\r\nthe steam engine establishment of James P. Allaire, soon after the\r\napplication of steam for the propulsion of boats and long before its\r\napplication to ships for the purposes of commerce or war. For fifty-two\r\nyears, with the exception of one or two brief intervals, he was\r\nconnected with the Allaire works in this city, and for more than forty\r\nyears he was the master mechanic and general superintendent of the\r\nworks. Probably no man now living has had a more intimate connection\r\nwith the construction of the marine steam engine in all its remarkable\r\nchanges and improvements, or been so long employed at one engine\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nJames P. Allaire, the founder of the Allaire Works, died May 20,1858, at\r\nthe age of 73. He was an intimate acquaintance of Fulton and from the\r\nengine of Fulton's first boat, the _Clermont_, took drawings which he\r\nused in the construction of his first marine engines. He built the\r\nengines for the _Chancellor Livingston_ which ran between New York and\r\nAlbany. He built also the first marine engines ever constructed in this\r\ncountry, which were put into the steamship _Savannah_, the first steamer\r\nthat crossed the Atlantic, and also those for the _Pacific_ and\r\n_Baltic_ of the Collins line, which ships surpassed in speed any before\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nUnder such tutelage and with such advantages Mr. Winship rose\r\nsuccessively through the grades of apprentice, journeyman, boss,\r\nand foreman, to the position of master mechanic and superintendent.\r\nConnected intimately with the progress of marine engineering for over\r\nhalf a century, he was the teacher of a large number of our engineers\r\nwho now reflect credit upon their instructor. Mr. Winship's professional\r\nskill was unsurpassed; his ability in directing and managing others and\r\nthorough acquaintance with the minutest details made him invaluable in\r\nthe position he so long honorably filled. His personal characteristics\r\nwere faithfulness, industry, earnestness, kindness of heart, and\r\nunvarying punctuality and promptness. As master mechanic it was his\r\ninvariable rule to be at the works an hour before the time for beginning\r\nlabor to lay out the work for the hands, getting his breakfast in winter\r\nby gas light and returning from dinner in time to see the condition\r\nof the work before the men arrived. In short, he made his employers'\r\nbusiness his own and neglected nothing which might contribute to their\r\nsuccess. He was a connecting link between the present generation of\r\nmechanics and that which saw the beginnings of that great power, steam,\r\nwhich has revolutionized the world. His funeral on the 8th of December\r\nwas attended by all the employés of the Allaire Works, by many from\r\nother mechanical establishments, and a large number of citizens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Make Intelligent Workmen--Go and Do Likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. H.

These vessels encountered\r\nevery variety of weather, and under all circumstances proved themselves\r\nto be staunch, reliable sea-going ships. The monitor type of vessel\r\nhas been constructed primarily for harbor defence, and it was not\r\ncontemplated that they would do more than move from port to port on our\r\nown coast. These voyages demonstrate their ability to go to any part of\r\nthe world, and it is believed by experienced naval officers that with\r\nslight modifications above the water line, in no way interfering with\r\ntheir efficiency in action, they will safely make the longest and most\r\ndifficult voyages without convoy.\r\n\r\nSteam, turreted iron-clads and fifteen-inch guns have revolutionized\r\nnaval warfare, and foreign governments, becoming sensible of this great\r\nchange, are slowly but surely coming to the conclusion that turreted\r\nvessels and heavy ordnance are essential parts of an efficient fighting\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN AS A MEDIUM OF BUSINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe seldom publish the favorable opinions expressed by our correspondents\r\nwhen in their letters they allude to this journal.

A number of attempts have been made to produce a\r\nself packing or steam expanding piston, which will act always with the\r\npressure of the steam and the velocity of the engine. The advantages\r\nof such a piston will be readily appreciated by practical engineers,\r\nespecially drivers of locomotives, working, as they nearly all do, at a\r\nvery high pressure of steam. The general complaint against the several\r\npackings in use on our railroads is, that they \"pack too tight,\"\r\nand rapidly wear out the rings, while the only remedy has been, the\r\nextremely uncertain one of contracting the openings by which steam is\r\nadmitted under the ring, or rings, to expand them. The obvious objection\r\nto such an arrangement is, that it allows the steam to act on the rings\r\nwith its full force during slow motion, as when a train is starting,\r\nwhile if effective under any circumstances, it will be so only at\r\ncomparatively high piston speed. The efficacy of such a remedy, if it\r\npossesses any, is in fact inversely as the piston speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.1]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is a perspective of the piston itself, or the \"spider,\" with its\r\nfollower and its rings removed, which are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 is a\r\ncross section of another form of the piston, to be presently described,\r\nbut which will serve to explain that shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Next to the\r\ncore of the spider are two narrow internal rings, A, in Figs. 1 and 3;\r\nsurrounding these two outer rings, B, the cross section of which is of\r\nL-form, as seen in Fig. 3. The lips of these outer rings extend to the\r\nwhole thickness of the piston. The flange head of the piston, and also\r\nthe follower, are turned beveling on their edges to admit the steam\r\naround the annular space thus formed under the rings, B. These spaces\r\nare plainly exhibited at C, in Figs. 2 and 3. Both inner and outer rings\r\nare adjusted to the bore of the cylinder by means of the gibs, D, and\r\nset screws seen in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.2]\r\n\r\nThe section, Fig. 3, represents a modification intended for use in\r\nvertical cylinders, if considered necessary. The additional center ring,\r\nE, is intended to prevent leakage through the cut in the expanded ring\r\nand over the face of the unexpanded one, which might occur when the\r\nrings and cylinder should become so worn that the rings, when not\r\nexpanded, should collapse and leave the surface of the cylinder. The\r\nrivets, F, shown by the dotted lines, are placed near the cuts in the\r\nL-rings, and are intended to hold the outside and inside rings together\r\nat that point, and prevent any tendency on the part of the latter\r\nto collapse and let steam under that part of the L-rings. Probably,\r\nhowever, if the packing is properly constructed and adjusted in the\r\nfirst instance, these devices will be unnecessary. In horizontal\r\ncylinders the weight of the piston, if properly supported on the set\r\nscrews and gibs, will accomplish these objects, if the cuts in the\r\nL-rings are placed near the bottom side of the cylinder. The steam\r\nenters the annular space between the beveled edges of the spider flange\r\nand follower and the inner periphery of the overhanging part of the\r\nL-rings, and acts only on that part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.3]\r\n\r\nPatented by Nathan Hunt, Sept. 17, 1867.

For this the\r\nScotch or ratchet drill, if the job is heavy, is employed, and if\r\nlight, the breast drill. The placing and working of the former consumes\r\nconsiderable time, and the labor of drilling with the breast drill is\r\nexcessive and exhausting. It is difficult also to hold the instrument so\r\nsteady as not to cramp and break the drill. The combination of the drill\r\nwith tongs and a pivoted bed piece, as seen in the engraving, obviates\r\nthese objections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEVERGOLD & STACKHOUSE'S TONGS DRILL.]\r\n\r\nTo the lower jaw, A, of a pair of tongs is pivoted a platen or bed, B,\r\nhaving a hole through its center, which is continued through the jaw for\r\nthe passage of the drillings. The upper jaw is formed with a circular\r\nflange on which is mounted the circular or disk-like base, C, of the\r\ndrill frame, D. This, with the frame, is secured on the jaw of the tongs\r\nby means of two screw bolts--one seen in the engraving--passing through\r\nthe jaw and screwing into the base of the drill. These bolts pass\r\nthrough semi-circular or segmental slots, by which the drill frame can\r\nbe swung around at different angles to the tongs, to adapt itself to the\r\nconvenience of the workman and the requirements of the work. If desired,\r\nthe crank by which the drill is driven may be used on the upright\r\nspindle, E. It will be seen that the pivoted base or bed, B, will allow\r\nthe work to adapt itself always to the line of the drill.\r\n\r\nIn operation, the work being placed between the drill and platen, the\r\nleft hand presses the handles of the tongs together, while the right\r\nturns the crank; the feed is thus graduated wholly by the pressure of\r\nthe hand. No further description is required for understanding the\r\nconstruction or operation of this tool. Patented by F. Nevergold and\r\nGeorge Stackhouse, June 19, 1866.

EDITORS:--Thinking it may be of use to some of the readers of\r\nyour invaluable paper, I have taken the liberty of sending you a sketch\r\nof a new mode of securing the cutter in a boring bar or pin drill. Where\r\nthe cutters are secured, as usual, by a key, all mechanics know that it\r\nis very difficult to set a cutter twice alike; and the notch, which\r\nis filed in the cutter, to prevent it from moving endways, is a great\r\nsource of weakness, often causing the cutters to crack in hardening, as\r\nwell as after they are put to work. The inclosed sketch will explain\r\nitself:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA is a cutter, and B a collar, screwed upon the cutter bar, C. The edge\r\nof this collar fits into a notch on either end of the cutter, as shown\r\nat D, thus leaving the cutter as strong as possible at the center, and\r\ngiving it a solid support at the point where support is needed, and at\r\nthe same time insuring its always coming alike.\r\n\r\nBrooklyn, N.Y.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE L. WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n[The device seems to be eminently well calculated for the support of the\r\ncutter on a boring bar, and is applicable, with but slight modification,\r\nto a pin or \"teat\" drill. Machinists will readily perceive its operation\r\nand excellencies.--EDS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTides and Their Causes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the daily tides of our seacoasts and tidal rivers is\r\nattributed to the attraction of the moon upon the earth--that the moon\r\ndraws the earth towards it, and that in drawing the earth towards it, it\r\nbulges up the water of the ocean on the side presented towards the moon,\r\nand drawing the earth and water thus on that side, also draws the earth\r\n_away_ from the water on the opposite side of it, and thus leaves the\r\nwater bulged up on _that_ side, and in doing all this the effect comes\r\nafter the cause some three hours, which is termed \"the tide lagging\r\nbehind.\" Now if we knew, _per se_, what attraction of gravitation was,\r\nand that it produced this anomaly of force, there would be nothing to\r\nquestion in the matter. But as we only know by attraction that it means\r\n_drawing to_, it is impossible to reconcile the theory of the tides as\r\nthey run to the attraction of the moon. If the moon is so potent in\r\ndrawing up, why does it not draw a bulge on the inland seas--our\r\ngreat lakes? I will not discuss the question of the moon's Apogee and\r\nPerigee--its different velocities in different parts[1] of its orbit, as\r\nlaid down by the law of Kepler, or whether it turns once on its axis in\r\na month, or not, as either theory will answer for its phases, as well\r\nas for the face of the \"Man in the Moon,\" but I will endeavor to give a\r\nmore rational theory for the phenomenon of the daily tides.\r\n\r\n[Transcribers note 1: typo fixed, changed from 'pasts' to 'parts']\r\n\r\nThe earth revolves on its axis and makes a revolution every twenty-four\r\nhours, and this moves its equatorial surface nearly a thousand miles per\r\nhour. Now the water on its surface, covering about three-fourths of it,\r\nand being more mobile than the solid earth, is, by centrifugal force,\r\nmade to roll around the earth, the same as the water is made to move\r\naround the grindstone when in motion, a thing familiar to every body\r\nthat uses that instrument. In the Southern Ocean this motion of the\r\nwater is so well known to mariners who double Cape Horn in sailing from\r\nSan Francisco to New York, that they now run considerably lower down in\r\norder to ride this tide eastward, than they did in former times. Here\r\nthen we have one fact of water tide more comprehensive, at least, than\r\nthe tractive theory of the moon. We have also the fact of two great\r\npromontories in Capes Horn and Good Hope, where this great tidal wave\r\nmust strike against, and they produce constant oscillations of the water\r\nto and fro, and produce gurgitation and regurgitation in all the gulfs\r\nand rivers that line the coasts of the Northern, or more properly, the\r\nLand Hemisphere. These gurgitations swell the water highest in the\r\nplaces where the seas become the narrowest, as the more northern\r\nlatitudes. In addition to these daily oscillations of the water, there\r\nare constant eddy currents, denominated \"Gulf Streams,\" all agreeing in\r\ntheir courses and motion to this theory of the ocean tides.\r\n\r\nWhen our present received tide theory of moon attraction was first laid\r\ndown, the fact of the water of the great Southern ocean rolling round\r\nfaster than the solid parts of our planets was not known. Smith in his\r\nPhysical Geography, says, \"The tidal wave flows from east to west, owing\r\nto the earth's daily rotation in a contrary direction.\" Here he is\r\nunintentionally correct, because the water striking these promontories\r\nof the two great capes, is hurled back, and not, as he assumes, that\r\nthe great ocean wave is moving from east to west. The United States\r\ngovernment sailing charts lay down the fact of this great ocean wave\r\nmoving from west to east, south of the capes, and the ships coming from\r\nthe Pacific to the Atlantic ocean take advantage of this and ride the\r\nsea at the rate of over twenty knots per hour, by following the routes\r\nlaid down in Maury's charts.\r\n\r\nThe old philosophy of the crystalline spheres was not more at variance\r\nwith the correct motion of the stars and planets, than the moon theory\r\nof the tides. In their dilemma to account for the retrograde motions of\r\nthe planets, they denominated them wanderers, stragglers, because they\r\nwould not march with the \"music of the spheres.\" In the moon theory of\r\nthe tides the lunar satellite is made to pull and push at one and the\r\nsame time, which is entirely at variance with the philosophy of force.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the heavens, nor in the earth, that proves to\r\nus positively that the sun holds the planets, and the planets their\r\nsatellites, by attraction, as we are taught that the moon attracts the\r\nwater of our world. We see that all terrestrial bodies tend toward the\r\ncenter of the earth, and we call this gravitation; but we cannot see how\r\na body moves around the earth without falling on it, by this law. We\r\nsay in dynamic philosophy, that bodies move in the direction of least\r\nresistance, and _that_ we can positively understand; but what force _per\r\nse_ is, we do not know. It is always better for us to explain phenomena\r\nby positive known laws and motions, than by any that rest merely upon\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nLancaster, Pa. JNO.

Editors:--In No. 21, current volume, you referred H. K., of\r\nWis., who had described the horse-hair snake, to page 280, No. 18\r\ncurrent volume, for a reply, which you considered \"sufficient.\" With\r\nyour kind permission I would like to speak a few words about the\r\n\"snakes\" in question. When I resided in Pennsylvania, I, in company with\r\nmany other lads, used to tie a bundle of horse hairs into a hard knot\r\nand then immerse them in the brook, when the water began to get warm,\r\nand in due time we would have just as many animals, with the power of\r\nlocomotion and appearance of snakes, as there were hairs in the bundle.\r\nI have raised them one-eighth of an inch in diameter, with perceptible\r\neyes and mouth on the butt end or root part of the hair. Take such a\r\nsnake and dip it in an alkaline solution, and the flesh or mucus that\r\nformed about the hair will dissolve, and the veritable horse hair is\r\nleft. They will not generate in limestone water, only in freestone or\r\nsalt water.\r\n\r\nCovington, Ky.\r\n\r\nT.W.B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMan Proposes, but God Disposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may not be generally known that but for one of those accidents which\r\nseem to be almost a direct interposition of Providence, Prof. Morse,\r\nthe originator of the magnetic telegraph, might have been now an artist\r\ninstead of the inventor of the telegraph, and that agent of civilization\r\nbe either unknown or just discovered. We publish from Tuckerman's \"Book\r\nof the Artists\" just from the press of G. P. Putnam & Son, the following\r\nreminiscence of Prof. Morse:\r\n\r\n\"A striking evidence of the waywardness of destiny is afforded by the\r\nexperience of this artist, if we pass at once from this early and\r\nhopeful moment to a more recent incident. He then aimed at renown\r\nthrough devotion to the beautiful; but it would seem as if the genius of\r\nhis country, in spite of himself, led him to this object, by the less\r\nflowery path of utility. He desired to identify his name with art, but\r\nit has become far more widely associated with science. A series of\r\nbitter disappointments obliged him to \"coin his mind for bread\", for a\r\nlong period, of exclusive attention to portrait painting, although, at\r\nrare intervals, he accomplished something more satisfactory. More than\r\nthirty years since, on a voyage from Europe, in a conversation with\r\nhis fellow passengers, the theme of discourse happened to be the\r\nelectromagnet; and one gentleman present related some experiments he had\r\nlately witnessed at Paris, which proved the almost incalculable rapidity\r\nof movement with which electricity was disseminated. The idea suggested\r\nitself to the active mind of the artist, that this wonderful and but\r\npartially explored agent might be rendered subservient to that system of\r\nintercommunication which had become so important a principle of modern\r\ncivilization. He brooded over the subject as he walked the deck, or lay\r\nwakeful in his berth, and by the time he arrived at New York, had so\r\nfar matured his invention as to have decided upon a telegraph of\r\nsigns, which is essentially that now in use. After having sufficiently\r\ndemonstrated his discovery to the scientific, a long period of toil,\r\nanxiety, and suspense intervened before he obtained the requisite\r\nfacilities for the establishment of the magnetic telegraph. It is now\r\nin daily operation in the United States, and its superiority over all\r\nsimilar inventions abroad was confirmed by the testimony of Arago and\r\nthe appropriation made for its erection by the French Government.\r\n\r\n\"By one of those coincidences which would be thought appropriate for\r\nromance, but which are more common, in fact, than the unobservant are\r\ndisposed to confess, these two most brilliant events in the painter's\r\nlife--his first successful work of art and the triumph of his scientific\r\ndiscovery--were brought together, as it were, in a manner singularly\r\nfitted to impress the imagination. Six copies of his \"Dying Hercules\"\r\nhad been made in London, and the mold was then destroyed. Four of these\r\nwere distributed by the artist to academies, one he retained, and the\r\nlast was given to Mr. Bulfinch, the architect of the Capitol--who was\r\nengaged at the time upon that building. After the lapse of many years,\r\nan accident ruined Morse's own copy, and a similar fate had overtaken\r\nthe others, at least in America. After vain endeavors to regain one of\r\nthese trophies of his youthful career, he at length despaired of seeing\r\nagain what could not fail to be endeared to his memory by the most\r\ninteresting associations. One day he was superintending the preparations\r\nfor the first establishment of his telegraph in the room assigned at the\r\nCapitol. His perseverence and self-denying labor had at length met\r\nits just reward, and he was taking the first active step to obtain a\r\nsubstantial benefit from his invention. It became necessary in locating\r\nthe wires, to descend into a vault beneath the apartment, which had not\r\nbeen opened for a long period. A man preceded the artist with a lamp. As\r\nthey passed along the subterranean chamber the latter's attention\r\nwas excited by something white glimmering through the darkness. In\r\napproaching the object, what was his surprise to find himself gazing\r\nupon his long-lost Hercules, which he had not seen for twenty years. A\r\nlittle reflection explained the apparent miracle. This was undoubtedly\r\nthe copy given to his deceased friend, the architect, and temporarily\r\ndeposited in the vault for safety, and undiscovered after his death.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtraordinary Effects of an Earthquake--An American Man-of-War Carried\r\nOver the Tops of Warehouses and Stranded.\r\n\r\n\r\n[OFFICIAL REPORT.]\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES STEAMSHIP \"MONONGAHELA,\" ST. CROIX, Nov. 21, 1867.\r\n\r\nSir:--I have to state, with deep regret, that the United States\r\nsteamship _Monongahela_, under my command, is now lying on the beach in\r\nfront of the town of Frederickstadt, St. Croix, where she was thrown by\r\nthe most fearful earthquake ever known here. The shock occurred at 3\r\no'clock, P. M., of the 18th inst. Up to that moment the weather was\r\nserene, and no indication of a change showed by the barometer, which\r\nstood at 30 degrees 15 minutes. The first indication we had of the\r\nearthquake was a violent trembling of the ship, resembling the blowing\r\noff of steam. This lasted some 30 seconds, and immediately afterward the\r\nwater was observed to be receding rapidly from the beach. In a moment\r\nthe current was changed, and bore the ship toward the beach, carrying\r\nout the entire cable and drawing the bolts from the kelson, without\r\nthe slightest effect in checking her terrific speed toward the beach.\r\nAnother anchor was ordered to be let go, but in a few seconds she was in\r\ntoo shoal water for this to avail. When within a few yards of the beach,\r\nthe reflux of the water checked her speed for a moment, and a light\r\nbreeze from the land gave me a momentary hope that the jib and\r\nforetopmost staysail might pay her head off shore, so that in the reflux\r\nof the wave she might reach waters sufficiently deep to float her, and\r\nthen be brought up by the other anchor. These sails were immediately\r\nset, and she payed off so as to bring her broadside to the beach. When\r\nthe sea returned, in the form of a wall of water 25 or 30 feet high, it\r\ncarried us over the warehouses into the first street of the town. This\r\nwave in receding took her back toward the beach, and left her nearly\r\nperpendicular on the edge of a coral reef, where she has now keeled over\r\nto an angle of 15 degrees.\r\n\r\nAll this was the work of a few moments only, and soon after the waters\r\nof the bay subsided into their naturally tranquil state, leaving us high\r\nand dry upon the beach. During her progress toward the beach she struck\r\nheavily two or three times; the first lurch carried the rifle gun on the\r\nforecastle overboard. Had the ship been carried 10 or 15 feet further\r\nout, she must inevitably have been forced over on her beam ends,\r\nresulting, I fear, in her total destruction, and in the loss of many\r\nlives. Providentially only four men were lost; these were in the boats\r\nat the time the shock commenced. The boats that were down were all\r\nswamped except my gig, which was crushed under the keel, killing my\r\ncoxswain, a most valuable man. During this terrific scene the officers\r\nand men behaved with coolness and subordination. It affords me great\r\npleasure to state, that, after a careful examination of the position and\r\ncondition of the ship, I am enabled to report that she has sustained no\r\nirreparable damage to her hull. The sternpost is bent, and some 20 feet\r\nof her keel partially gone; propeller and shaft uninjured. The lower\r\npintle of the rudder is gone, but no other damage is sustained by it. No\r\ndamage is done to her hull more serious than the loss of several sheets\r\nof copper, torn from her starboard bilge and from her keel.\r\n\r\nShe now lies on the edge of a coral reef, which forms a solid\r\nfoundation, on which ways may be laid. She can thus be launched in 10\r\nfeet of water at 100 feet from the beach. Gentlemen looking at the ship\r\nfrom shore declare that the bottom of the bay was visible where there\r\nwas before, and is now, 40 fathoms of water.\r\n\r\nTo extricate the ship from her position I respectfully suggest that\r\nMr. I. Hanscom be sent down with suitable material for ways, ready for\r\nlaying down, and india-rubber camels to buoy her up. I think there is no\r\ninsuperable obstacle to her being put afloat, providing a gang of ten or\r\ntwelve good ship carpenters be sent down with the Naval Constructor, as\r\nher boilers and engines appear to have sustained no injury. A valuable\r\nship may thus be saved to the navy, with all her stores and equipments.\r\n\r\nS. B. BISSELL, Commodore Commanding. Rear-Admiral J. S. Palmer,\r\ncommanding H. A.

F. McK., of Md.--\"What kind of silk is used for balloons, what is the\r\nvarnish which covers them, and what amount of common illuminating gas\r\nwill support one pound weight?\" Silk for large balloons is now rarely\r\nused, stout cotton cloth being substituted. Ordinary boiled linseed oil\r\nmakes a good varnish. Any elastic varnish will do, however. The specific\r\ngravity of ordinary illuminating gas ranges from 0.540 to 0.700, air\r\nbeing 1.000. Its weight may be called one-thirty-second of a pound to\r\nthe cubic foot and atmospheric air about three-fourths of a pound.\r\n\r\nR. B. C., of Pa., says: \"Here is a proposition in geometry which I would\r\nlike to see demonstrated theoretically by one of your correspondents.\r\nThe side of a regular heptagon is equal to half the side of an\r\nequilateral triangle inscribed in the same circle. The mechanical\r\nconstruction is very simple and will be found useful. I discovered it\r\nsome years ago and am not aware of its ever having been in print.\"\r\n\r\nF. H., of Mich., asks \"if sal-soda will scale a boiler?\" H. N. Winans,\r\n11 Wall street, N.

The most reliable and positively uninjurious remedy for\r\nincrustations is his anti-incrustation powder--in successful use for 12\r\nyears past.\r\n\r\nT., of R. I., speaks of the famous mechanical horse shown at the Paris\r\nExposition which is said to have accomplished with its rider a little\r\nover an English mile in fifty seconds, and asks what is the motive\r\npower. As it is said that the French Government took possession of the\r\nmachine and preserves its mechanical construction a secret, we know no\r\nmore about it than about the much vaunted Napoleon cannon.\r\n\r\nS.S., of N.

The new bridge opens like a fan towards the\r\nfreight yard at Pittsburg being at the narrowest part, next to the main\r\nspan 55 feet wide. The river is crossed with spans averaging 153½ feet\r\nin the clear, with a bearing of five feet on each pier. The principle\r\nof the construction is known as the lattice girder plan, with vertical\r\nstiffening. The work was executed under the superintendence of its\r\ndesigner, the engineer and architect of the company Felician Stataper.\r\n\r\nThe production of precious metals in the United States from 1849 to 1867\r\ninclusive, has amounted in value to $1,174,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe president of one of the New Jersey railroads proposes a plan to\r\navoid the danger to life and limb from the series of trains that run\r\ninto and out of Jersey city. The new project is to elevate the present\r\ntracks fifteen feet above the streets, and by safe machinery to lower at\r\nonce an entire train in the depot at the river.\r\n\r\nA mining company at Newton, Nev., are making preparations to work their\r\nclaims by means of a steam engine which will be used to throw a stream\r\nof water instead of the ordinary hydraulic pressure They estimate that\r\nwith a ten or twelve horse power engine, then can throw 100 inches of\r\nwater with a force equal to at least 150 feet fall. The result of this\r\nexperiment is looked upon with a good deal of interest, as there is a\r\nvast amount of good hydraulic ground in the adjoining countries, which,\r\nas in this case, cannot be worked by the ordinary process for want of\r\nwater fall, but which, if the expedient in this case proves successful,\r\nwill soon be worked by steam engines.\r\n\r\nBy an oversight in the article on the trans-continental railroad,\r\npublished in our last issue, the Western or California section of the\r\nroad was styled the Union Pacific, instead of the Central railroad. In\r\nthe race to reach Salt Lake the California company have 400 miles more\r\nto build, while the Union company have only 328 miles. But the country\r\nto be traversed by the former is comparatively level, and favorable for\r\nwinter work, while that on the other side crosses four distinct mountain\r\nranges, and winter storms must interrupt work for several months in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENT OFFICE DECISIONS ON APPEAL.\r\n\r\nUSEFUL COMPOUNDS ARE PATENTABLE--THE APPLICANT NOT REQUIRED TO PROVE THE\r\nFUNCTION OF EACH INGREDIENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.H.

But it is objected\r\nthat \"a medical prescription\" \"should contain some recognition of the\r\nmedicinal properties of the several ingredients\" \"and the part they\r\nperform in the compound:\" or, as it is elsewhere expressed, such a\r\nmixture should not receive the sanction of this department \"unless\r\nperhaps a satisfactory rationale should be given for the use of each of\r\nthe ingredients in the proportions named.\"\r\n\r\nIf the medical faculty were always satisfied themselves as to the\r\noperation of the various remedies they employ, there might be more\r\nreason in the objection. But it is well known that different schools\r\ndisagree widely on this subject, and there are remedies employed with\r\nsuccess the effect of which the most intelligent are unable to account\r\nfor. So long as there is a single one of this character to be found, and\r\nwhile the operations of the vital functions are so concealed from us\r\nthat we are unable fully to comprehend the process by which any specific\r\noperates, so long it is impossible to prescribe as a conditon of\r\npatentability, a full explanation of the mode in which any one acts that\r\nis brought forward. It would be still less justifiable to require such\r\nan explanation as would content any particular class of medical men.\r\nEvery year new therapeutics are introduced into practice, and not\r\nunfrequently some whose beneficial results are not understood. And as\r\nlong as one such may be found, it is not just to make it a condition of\r\nits being protected by a patent, that the discoverer should bring the\r\nscientific world to agree with him in his theory respecting it, nor even\r\nthat he should have one.\r\n\r\nThe man who stumbles upon a new and useful article is just as much\r\nentitled to the exclusive use of it as if he had elaborated it by the\r\nmost profound and painful study. It is true that there is danger upon\r\nthis principle of countenancing mere nostrums, and giving them undue\r\nprestige This can only be guarded against by the exercise of great\r\ncaution and requiring convincing proof of utility. Such his been\r\nfurnished in this case, in abundance.\r\n\r\nThe application cannot be rejected except upon such grounds as would\r\ninsure the rejection of nearly all medicines whatever. Nor is the Office\r\nresponsible for the false importance which the public may attach to its\r\nproceedings, so long is they are confined to its legitimate province.\r\nIts duties certainly must not be neglected, and meritorious petitions\r\nrefused, in order to obviate such misapprehensions.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Primary Examiner is reversed.\r\n\r\n[Transcribers note: full index of volume XVII. left out]",
