Similarly in\r\nFiji, Seemann’s “Flora Vitiensis” was my counsellor and guide in the\r\nmatter of plants.\r\n\r\nIn Hawaii I was in a land of active sub-aerial volcanoes, and I paid my\r\ndevotions at all the altars of “Pele,” their presiding deity. In Fiji I\r\ntrod upon the surface of submarine volcanoes that emerged ages since\r\nfrom the ocean and still retain their coverings of sea-deposits. Both in\r\nHawaii and Fiji I lived much among the people; and though my chief\r\ninterest lay in the comparison of these two types of volcanic islands, I\r\ncould not but be drawn to the kindly natives whose hospitality I so long\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nDestiny led me to Vanua Levu in the following fashion. With the relief\r\nparty to take me down from Mauna Loa there arrived a well-known German\r\nnaturalist who, like myself, had been interested in coral-reef\r\ninvestigations. We discussed this warm topic at an elevation of nearly\r\n14,000 feet above the sea, with the thermometer at 20° F. As we sipped\r\nour hot coffee and listened to the occasional “boom” from the bottom of\r\nthe great crater, at the edge of which we were camped, I remarked to my\r\nfriend that I was thinking of spending some months in Samoa. To this he\r\ngood-humouredly replied that I might leave Samoa to his countrymen and\r\ndescribe one of the large islands of Fiji. International rivalry over\r\nthat group of islands was then rather keen. However, Dr. K. went to\r\nSamoa, and I have now completed this volume on the geology of Vanua\r\nLevu, Fiji.\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to lay stress here on the difficulties and\r\nhardships connected with the exploration of little known tropical\r\nregions. Many will be familiar with all that these imply, where the\r\nrainfall ranges from 100 to 250 inches, where the forests are dense,\r\nwhere tracks are few and swollen rivers are numerous, and where the\r\ntorrent’s bed presents often the only road.\r\n\r\nThe only extensive geological collections made in Fiji previous to my\r\nvisit were those of Kleinschmidt in 1876-78, which together with a small\r\ncollection previously made by Dr. Gräffe were examined by Dr. A.\r\nWichmann. These rocks were obtained from Viti Levu, Kandavu, Ovalau,\r\netc., but not from Vanua Levu. Dr. Wichmann’s paper of 1882, descriptive\r\nof these collections, presents us with the results of one of the\r\nearliest studies by modern methods of research of the volcanic rocks of\r\nthe Pacific Islands. It is to this investigator that we are indebted for\r\nthe establishment of the occurrence of plutonic rocks, such as granites,\r\ngabbros, diorites, in Viti Levu.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as far as I can ascertain, few, if any, rocks have been\r\nspecially described from Vanua Levu, this island was visited by Dana in\r\n1840 when attached to the United States Exploring Expedition under\r\nWilkes. His observations on its geology were published in his volume on\r\nthe geology of the expedition. Although not extensive they are valuable\r\nfrom their reference to his discovery of trachytic and rhyolitic rocks\r\nas well as acid pumice-tuffs in the island. It is singular that his\r\nobservations have apparently been overlooked by all his successors.\r\nWichmann with this discovery unknown to him remarked on the seeming\r\nabsence of quartz-bearing recent eruptive rocks from the South Seas.\r\n\r\nWhen the “Challenger” Expedition visited the group in 1875 some\r\ngeological collections were made which were described by Prof. Renard in\r\nthe second volume on the “Physics and Chemistry” of the expedition. No\r\ncollections, however, were made in Vanua Levu. In 1878 Mr. John Horne,\r\nDirector of the Botanic Gardens at Mauritius, made some important\r\nobservations on the geological structure of this island and of other\r\nparts of the group, which he published in his account of the islands\r\ngiven in “A Year in Fiji.” No collections were obtained by him; but\r\nprominence is given to his observations by Dr. Wichmann and others. Like\r\nDana in the case of the acid volcanic rocks, Mr. Horne has forestalled\r\nme in his conclusion that Vanua Levu amongst the other larger islands\r\nhas been formed mainly of the products of submarine eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe visit of Prof. A. Agassiz to Fiji in 1897-98 gave a fresh impetus to\r\nits geological investigation. We are indebted to him not only for his\r\nown extensive memoir on the islands and coral reefs of this group, but\r\nalso for the subsequent important explorations of Mr. E. C. Andrews and\r\nMr. B. Sawyer in Viti Levu and the Lau Islands. These two gentlemen have\r\nsince published a short paper on the caves of these islands. Mr. Eakle\r\nhas described the volcanic rocks collected during the visit of Prof.\r\nAgassiz. It is, however, noteworthy that, although the collections were\r\nmade in Viti Levu, Kandavu and in many other of the smaller islands,\r\nVanua Levu is not represented. Mr. Eakle’s conclusion that basic\r\nandesites and basalts are the characteristic rocks of the region, the\r\naugite-andesites predominating, would apply to Vanua Levu in great part.\r\nThis island possesses also in fair amount hypersthene-andesites and\r\ndacitic or felsitic andesites, which are very scantily represented in\r\nthe collections examined by Mr. Eakle. In connection with the\r\nquartz-porphyries and trachytic rocks which also occur in Vanua Levu, it\r\nshould be observed that Mr. Andrews describes a rhyolite from Suva in\r\nViti Levu. Unlike Viti Levu, Vanua Levu displays but a small development\r\nof plutonic rocks.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it should be pointed out that much remains to be done in\r\nthe geological exploration of this island, and that I would have spent a\r\nthird year in this task much to my profit. Still I hope that a period of\r\ntwo years devoted to its investigation will be regarded as some excuse\r\nfor a certain over-confidence in the expression of my opinions.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate all those from whom I received much kindness in these\r\nislands would be a lengthy task. My indebtedness is very great to Bishop\r\nVidal, Father Rougier, and to various other members of the Roman\r\nCatholic Mission, and I experienced similar favours at the hands of Mr.\r\nWilliams and other Wesleyan Missionaries in Vanua Levu. Mr. F. Spence\r\nand Mrs. Spence showed me great kindness, and from Dr. Corney I received\r\nvaluable assistance on my arrival in the group. To the planters my debt\r\nis equally great, more especially to Mr. Barratt, Mr. Dods, and Mr.\r\nMills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I would suggest the foundation of a “Fijian Society” for\r\nthe investigation of the islands, for the gathering together of all that\r\nhas been written about the group and its people, and for the advancement\r\nof science.\r\n\r\n                                                   HENRY BROUGHAM GUPPY.\r\n\r\n_June, 1903._\r\n\r\n  _Note._—A type set of my geological collections representing the\r\n  massive rocks from this island has been kindly accepted by the\r\n  Curator of the Geological Museum, Jermyn Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     LIST OF SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL AUTHORITIES QUOTED IN THIS BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nDANA, J.

(see introduction.)_\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              OBSERVATIONS OF A NATURALIST IN THE PACIFIC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n          GENERAL INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON SOME OF THE LEADING\r\n                    PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE remarkable shape of this island at once attracts the attention: and\r\nindeed it is in its irregular outline and in the occurrence over a large\r\nportion of its surface of submarine tuffs and agglomerates that will be\r\nfound a key to the study of its history. With an extreme length of 98\r\nmiles, an average breadth of 15 to 20 miles, and a maximum elevation of\r\nnearly 3,500 feet, it has an area, estimated at 2,400 square miles,\r\ncomparable with that of the county of Devon.\r\n\r\nWhilst its peculiarly long and narrow dimensions are to be associated\r\nwith the narrowing of the submarine basaltic platform, from which it\r\nrises together with the other large island of Viti Levu, its extremely\r\nirregular shape is closely connected with the composite mode of its\r\norigin. We have here exemplified the process of the building up of a\r\ncontinental island in the great area of emergence of the Western\r\nPacific, that region which displays at various heights above the sea the\r\nancient reefs and the underlying deposits of the Solomon Islands, New\r\nHebrides, Fiji, Tonga, &c. But this process of construction has never\r\nbeen completed, and is at present suspended; yet it is in its incomplete\r\ncondition that Vanua Levu possesses its importance for the investigation\r\nof this subject.\r\n\r\nThis island has in fact been formed by the union of a number of smaller\r\nvolcanic islands during a long protracted period of emergence. These\r\noriginal islands are indicated approximately by the 1,800-feet\r\ncontour-level in the accompanying map. There is, however, no reason for\r\nsupposing that the movement of emergence has altogether ceased. In the\r\ncourse of ages the extensive submarine plateau, from which it rises,\r\nwill be laid bare; and the small surrounding islands that are situated\r\nupon it, such as Yanganga, Kia, Mali, Rambi, Kioa, &c., will be included\r\nin the area of Vanua Levu.[1]\r\n\r\nExcluding for the moment the effects of denudation, which have been very\r\ngreat, we shall be able to discern some of the stages of the building-up\r\nof the island during the emergence or upheaval by looking at the map and\r\nreversing the process in imagination. A subsidence of only 50 feet would\r\ncause the Natewa Peninsula to be isolated by a sea-passage along the\r\nline of the Salt Lake; whilst several islands would be formed along the\r\nnorthern and southern coasts, and the Naivaka Peninsula would become\r\ndetached. If the subsidence extended to 300 feet, the sea would flow\r\nover a large portion of the island, where it would regain what was not\r\nmany ages since its own, an area of basaltic plains, which by their\r\nprolongation under the sea form the great submarine plateau. A\r\nsubsidence of 1,000 feet would break up the remaining elevated axis of\r\nthe island into a number of lesser portions; and after a total lowering\r\nof 1,800 feet there would exist only a few scattered islands, the\r\narrangement of which would show but little relation to the present form\r\nof Vanua Levu. At either end of the area there would arise from the sea\r\nthe isolated volcanic peaks of Seatura and Ngala (Mount Freeland); and\r\nbetween them would be situated four or five long narrow islands,\r\ntogether with a group of small islands and islets where Na Raro and the\r\nother acid andesite mountains of the Ndrandramea district now lie.\r\n\r\nAs might be partly expected, there is in the surface-configuration of\r\nthe interior of Vanua Levu an absence of that simplicity of contour\r\nwhich exists in a volcanic island of supra-marine formation, as for\r\ninstance in the large island of Hawaii where the three great volcanic\r\nmountains of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa and Hualalai together with the older\r\nKohala range, determine the form of the whole island’s surface.[2] Here\r\nin Vanua Levu there is, on the contrary, but little order amongst its\r\nphysical features. The rivers often run obliquely with the sea-border,\r\nwhilst mountains frequently rise at the coast and plains lie far inland,\r\nand the view of the elevated interior, as obtained from one of the\r\npeaks, presents in many parts a series of mountain-ridges running\r\nathwart the island’s axis.\r\n\r\nA study of the profile of the island is an important preliminary step to\r\nits more detailed examination. One may ramble over a particular region\r\nof it for weeks, as I have done, without getting any satisfactory idea\r\nof the true configuration of the surface. In a locality densely wooded\r\nand occupied by steep mountain ridges and deep gorges, the field of view\r\nis often very limited; but seen from the deck of a passing ship the main\r\nfeatures of the island assume their true proportions and relations, and\r\nmuch that was uncertain is in this manner made plain. The profile here\r\ngiven has been constructed from a number of others, and represents in a\r\ngraphic fashion Vanua Levu as viewed from the southward. I have here\r\nsacrificed smaller details and occasionally some degree of accuracy in\r\nsmall matters in order to bring out the principal features of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nAt and near the extreme western extremity rise the conspicuous hills of\r\nSesaleka (1,370 feet), Naivaka (1,651 feet) and Koroma (1,384 feet), all\r\nof them formed of basic volcanic materials.[3] Naivaka, which is\r\nconnected with the main island by a narrow isthmus, only about 30 feet\r\nin height, is probably one of the most recent additions to the island’s\r\narea; and it is at the same time one of the most recent of the numerous\r\nvolcanic vents that once existed. The leading feature, however, of this\r\nend of Vanua Levu is the great mountain of Seatura (2,812 feet), which\r\noccupies a large part of the Mbua province and monopolises most of the\r\nlandscape whilst largely determining the form of the western extremity\r\nof the island. It is a basaltic mountain of the Mauna Loa type, its long\r\neastern slope descending gently at an angle of three or four degrees for\r\nabout ten miles to the mouth of the Wainunu River. In its deeply eroded\r\nradial valleys and gorges, and in other respects, it is not unlike the\r\nisland of Tahiti, as described by Dana.\r\n\r\nThe Ndrandramea region to the eastward, which I have named after one of\r\nits best known peaks, has a profile of a very different character. Its\r\nbroken outline indicates the existence of numerous mountains and hills\r\nof acid andesites, occasionally dacitic. Although some of them attain a\r\nheight of 2,000 feet and over their tops alone are seen from seaward.\r\nBetween the foot of these mountains and the south coast extends a great\r\nplateau of columnar basalt, incrusted at its borders with submarine\r\ndeposits, which descends coastward with a very gentle slope, the fall in\r\nabout five miles being only about 300 feet (1,100 to 800 feet). It\r\nterminates abruptly opposite the elevated headland of Ulu-i-ndali, a\r\nrange, composed mainly of grey olivine-basalts, which is not indicated\r\nin the profile.\r\n\r\n      PROFILES OF VANUA LEVU AS VIEWED FROM THE SOUTH. GRAPHICALLY\r\n    REPRESENTED ON A HORIZONTAL SCALE OF ABOUT 16 MILES TO THE INCH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From NAITHOMBOTHOMBO Point to UNDU Point, representing\r\nthe length of the island (98 miles).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The NATEWA Peninsula from the Salt Lake to Kumbalau\r\nPoint.]\r\n\r\nThe two conical peaks of Vatu Kaisia (1,880 feet) and Na Raro (2,420\r\nfeet), which rise up so unexpectedly in the region immediately east of\r\nthe Ndrandramea district, are also of acid andesitic rocks, in the last\r\ncase approaching the dacitic type. They lie within the borders of the\r\narea of basic tuffs, basic agglomerates, and basic massive rocks, that\r\nhere begins and extends eastward to Mount Thurston and a little beyond.\r\nEast of Na Raro there is a gap or break in the profile, where the\r\ngreatest elevation is probably not over 800 feet; and on its farther\r\nside rises up the mountain of Va Lili (2,930 feet), a lofty inland ridge\r\nthat lies towards the southern coast. Palagonite-tuffs and agglomerates\r\nare the prevailing surface-formations in this district.\r\n\r\nEastwards from Va Lili extends for eight or nine miles a lofty,\r\nlevel-topped, and almost peakless range, which I have called the\r\nKorotini Table-land, after the towns once situated on its southern\r\nslopes. Its outline is shown in the background of the view facing page\r\n153. It is, however, not so level-topped as it appears to be; but the\r\ngradual variations in elevation between 2,000 and 3,000 feet, when\r\nspread over a length of some miles, are more or less lost in the general\r\noutline of the range as viewed from the coast. Basic agglomerates are\r\nprincipally exposed on the lower slopes; whilst higher up, reaching\r\noften to the summit of the table-land, occur palagonite-tuffs containing\r\ntests of foraminifera and molluscan shells, massive basic rocks being\r\nexposed in places.\r\n\r\nThe level profile of the Korotini tableland gives place, as one proceeds\r\neastward, to the broken outline of the several lofty peaks of Mariko\r\n(2,890 feet), Mbatini (3,437 feet), Thambeyu (3,124 feet) and others.[4]\r\nEach of these peaks marks one of the bold mountain-ridges that form such\r\na striking feature in the surface-configuration of this part of the\r\nisland. On the slopes of these ridges, and often also on their summits,\r\nappear basic agglomerates and palagonitic tuffs and clays often\r\ninclosing tests of foraminifera; whilst exposed in the gorges and\r\nprotruding at times through the tuffs and agglomerates on the crests of\r\nthe ridges are displayed massive basic rocks of the type of the\r\nhypersthene-augite andesites.\r\n\r\nEast of Thambeyu the level sinks to about 1,000 feet above the sea, and\r\nbeyond rises an irregular group of hills and mountains which attain\r\ntheir greatest height in Nailotha,[5] 2,481 feet above the sea. We are\r\nnow near the limit of the area of basic rocks. Following the profile as\r\nit slopes away, marked by occasional peaks and breaks, towards Undu\r\nPoint, we pass at first over a district where basic rocks are mixed with\r\nthose of more acid type; but before we reach Mount Thuku we enter the\r\ndistrict of oligoclase-trachytes, quartz-porphyries, and rhyolitic\r\ntuffs, that extends to the extremity of the Undu promontory.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be noticed the profile of the Natewa Peninsula. As\r\nshown in the diagram, this level begins at a few feet above the sea in\r\nthe vicinity of the Salt Lake; and as it proceeds eastward it attains a\r\nlevel of 1,960 feet in Ngalau-levu and of 1,540 feet in the Waikawa\r\npromontory, finally culminating, as it nears Kumbulau Point, in a\r\nmountainous district which attains its greatest elevation of 2,740 feet\r\nabove the sea in the lofty ridge of Ngala, the Mount Freeland of the\r\nchart. Altered basic rocks prevail in this peninsula; but more acid\r\nandesites also occur, and foraminiferous tuffs and clays are exposed on\r\nthe slopes, reaching to over 1,000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this reference to the profile of the island with the\r\nremark that if I had neglected to indicate here the close connection\r\nthat exists between the nature of the surface-configuration and the\r\ncharacter of the prevailing rocks I should have ignored a means of\r\ninvestigation which has proved of the greatest value. The rock and\r\nsurface characters go together. The inland plateau now upheaved 1,000\r\nfeet above the sea, was built up by submarine flows of basaltic lava.\r\nThe isolated conical peak that so unexpectedly intrudes itself into the\r\nview is the dacitic core of some submarine volcano long since stripped\r\nof most of its fragmental coverings. The lofty mountain-ridges that run\r\nathwart the island’s breadth, with their summits usually in the\r\nrain-clouds received their coverings of tuffs and agglomerates ages ago\r\nwhen they were submerged; and now they rise to heights of over 3,000\r\nfeet above the sea. Bound up with the mysterious origin of these great\r\nridges is the history of the island of Vanua Levu.\r\n\r\nThese preliminary remarks are only intended to serve as a general\r\nintroduction to the detailed description of the island and its\r\nformations. The closing chapter is devoted to a summary of the principal\r\nresults of my investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    ON THE EVIDENCE OF EMERGENCE OR OF UPHEAVAL AT THE SEA-BORDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE would have expected that in an island where submarine muds and tuffs\r\nare of such common occurrence at the surface, extending from the\r\nsea-border to elevations of 2,000 feet and over, upraised coral reefs\r\nwould be also frequent and extensive. But it is remarkable that the\r\nuplifted masses of reef-limestone, so characteristic of the islands of\r\nthe Lau Group, are here very scantily represented. It is certainly true\r\nthat the fossiliferous volcanic muds that form the foundations of coral\r\nreefs are often exposed at and near the coast; but the elevated reefs\r\nthat ought to be found reposing on them are rarely to be observed.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be inferred, however, that in a region so remarkable for\r\nthe great development of reef-formations coral reefs did not then thrive\r\nin these localities, but rather that such a long period has elapsed\r\nsince the emergence of the present sea-border that the upraised coral\r\nreefs at and near the coast have long since been in a great part\r\nstripped off by the denuding agencies. Notwithstanding this, it is\r\nevident that coral reefs could never have been very extensive at the\r\nsea-border during the last stages of the emergence; whilst they do not\r\nappear to have existed at all during the early periods of the history of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be observed that hard compact limestones of\r\nany kind are rarely to be found, and only in a scanty fashion. The\r\nextensive development of dolomites and hard limestones, described by Mr.\r\nAndrews and others in the valley of the Singatoka in Viti Levu, is not a\r\ncharacter of Vanua Levu. The foraminiferous and pteropod clays, which\r\nexist in the interior and often in the heart of the island, are not\r\noverlaid by ancient reef-limestones, but by great masses of volcanic\r\nagglomerate and coarse fossiliferous tuffs, the foraminiferous muds in\r\ntheir turn covering the core of massive volcanic rocks. There were no\r\nsigns of coral-reef fragments in the volcanic agglomerates in any\r\nlocality examined, notwithstanding that these agglomerates are so\r\nintimately associated with the fossiliferous tuffs and clays that their\r\nsubmarine origin could not be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe conditions for reef-formation evidently did not exist in that early\r\nstage of the island’s history, when the foraminiferous tuffs and clays,\r\nnow occurring at elevations of 2,000 feet and over, were being deposited\r\non the sea-bottom. At some time or other, however, these high\r\nmountain-slopes, previous to their emergence from the sea, must have\r\nbeen within the limits of the zone of reef-building corals. If reefs had\r\nbeen formed along those ancient coasts, or on the original shoals, they\r\nwould have been in some cases preserved, as in the case of the\r\nforaminiferous tuffs and clays, by a covering of volcanic agglomerate.\r\nThese soft submarine deposits have been in this manner saved from the\r\ndestructive effects of denudation over a large part of the island\r\nwhether on the higher slopes or at the lower levels; but no trace of\r\nreef-formation ever came under my notice in the higher regions of the\r\ninterior. This is a puzzling point that will have to be considered in\r\nconnection with the origin of the great mountain ridges, one of the most\r\ndifficult problems in the history of the building-up of Vanua Levu.\r\n\r\nI will now refer to the evidence of the latest stage of the upheaval of\r\nthe island as indicated at and near the sea-border by the scantily\r\noccurring upraised reefs. The elevated reefs are mostly to be found on\r\nthe south coast between Fawn Harbour and Na Viavia Islet off Harman’s or\r\nSavu-savu Point. Na Viavia Islet itself is 300 or 400 yards in length\r\nand is formed of much honeycombed reef-limestone, which is raised 10 or\r\n12 feet above the high-water line. Proceeding eastward along the south\r\ncoast of the Savu-savu promontory we next come upon uplifted reefs in a\r\ncuriously isolated hill that rises on the coast between Naithekoro and\r\nNaindi Bay. This hill is about 250 feet in height and is composed in the\r\nmass of coral limestone. About 100 feet above the sea-level it exhibits\r\nan erosion-line, above which it rises precipitously to the summit. The\r\nwest point of Naindi Bay is formed of reef-limestone reaching to a\r\nheight of 40 to 50 feet and displaying in position massive corals,\r\n“Fungiæ,” and “Tridacna” shells. Near its base, four to five feet above\r\nthe present high-water level, it shows an erosion line. This limestone\r\noverlies a rock in which blocks of volcanic rocks, five to six inches\r\nacross, are imbedded in a calcareous matrix.\r\n\r\nRaised coral limestone occurs at intervals on the coast between Naindi\r\nBay and the mouth of the Salt Lake Passage, usually forming low islets,\r\nof which the smaller about 12 feet in height often assume, through the\r\nerosion of the sea at their base, that peculiar mushroom-shape, so\r\ncharacteristic of upheaval on reef-bound coasts. The passage into the\r\nSalt Lake lies in a slightly elevated reef-mass; and the islet which\r\nrises up in its centre to about a foot above the water-level is mainly\r\nformed of coral blocks, although I did not find any remains of coral on\r\nthe low neck of land intervening between the Salt Lake and Natewa Bay.\r\nEastward from the Salt Lake Passage to Nanutha in the vicinity of Fawn\r\nHarbour low cliffs of coral limestone, six to eight feet high and\r\noccasionally displaying massive corals in position, most frequently\r\nconstitute the sea-border, rarely, however, extending more than a few\r\npaces inland or attaining there a greater elevation than 12 or 15 feet.\r\n\r\nThis limitation of the upraised reef-belt to the immediate vicinity of\r\nthe coast is true of all this district. It is only when the sea-border\r\nis low and swampy that it is found 100 or 200 yards inland; and in any\r\ncase as one follows it inland it soon gives place to the fossiliferous\r\nmud-rocks and tuffs of the interior. It should be noted that the\r\nupraised reefs of this region were rarely observed at greater heights\r\nthan 20 feet above the sea, in fact usually at a much lower level. The\r\nexceptional occurrence in mass of reef-limestone at a height of 250 feet\r\nin a coast hill between Naithekoro and Naindi therefore lends colour to\r\nthe idea that the elevated reefs formerly extended farther inland and\r\nthat they have been stripped off by denudation.\r\n\r\nOn the north coast of the Natewa Peninsula elevated reefs are of very\r\nrare occurrence. I walked along the whole of that coast from the head of\r\nNatewa Bay to within four miles of Kumbulau Point and only found them in\r\nthe locality, one to one and a half miles west of the mouth of the river\r\nNdreke-ni-wai. Here there were two islets, 20 to 25 feet high and lying\r\nclose to the shore, which were formed entirely of coral-rock, massive\r\ncorals occurring in position in their lower part. Although, however,\r\nupraised reefs are so scantily to be found on this coast, other proofs\r\nof upheaval are to be observed in the fossiliferous tuffs exposed\r\noccasionally by the beach. On the east coast of this peninsula, between\r\nNdevo and Loa, submarine tuffs and sandstones, at times fossiliferous,\r\nwere alone noticed.\r\n\r\nUpraised reefs are also very rare on the north coast of Natewa Bay. Here\r\nagain I traversed the whole coast from the head of the bay to Undu\r\nPoint, a distance as the crow flies of about 50 miles; but I find no\r\nrecord in my notes of any elevated reef-formations. However the\r\ncalcareous nature of the volcanic tuffs exposed in places at the coast\r\nindicate emergence. The extreme rarity, if not the absence, of upraised\r\nreefs on this long stretch of coast, which is usually bordered by\r\nshore-reefs, is very remarkable, more especially since there is\r\nextensive evidence of upheaval in the plains of Kalikoso in the\r\ninterior, as indicated in the succeeding paragraph.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of Undu Point, between that headland and Lambasa,\r\nelevated reefs did not come under my observation, although in the\r\nlow-lying inland district of the Kalikoso lake silicified corals are\r\nscattered about in quantity at an elevation of 20 or 30 feet above the\r\nsea. But the emergence of the sea-border is shown in the occurrence of a\r\n“Globigerina” sedimentary tuff near Visongo at a height of 200 feet (see\r\npage 221), and by the occasionally calcareous character of the\r\npumice-tuffs that mainly compose the coast cliffs. Near Nukundamu these\r\ntuffs of the shore cliffs inclose subangular fragments of massive corals\r\nof the size of a walnut; whilst in a cutting between Mbuthai-sau and\r\nLambasa, about 50 feet above the sea, I observed bits of coral limestone\r\nin a basic tuff. Mr. Horne refers to seams or layers of coral limestone\r\noccurring in the volcanic agglomerate of the coast cliffs between\r\nLambasa and Tutu Island.[6] Since his experience of this coast was\r\nmostly confined to a passage in a canoe along the shore, it is very\r\nprobable that he only saw the beds of white pumice-tuffs that prevail in\r\nplaces on this coast. I found no beds of coral limestone in the\r\nshore-agglomerates of this coast, nor does Dana in his description of\r\nthe pumiceous formation of the cliffs of Mali Point make any reference\r\nto them.[7]\r\n\r\nAlong the stretch of 50 miles of coast between Lambasa and Naivaka\r\nupraised reefs are of infrequent occurrence. However between Lambasa and\r\nWailevu, coral limestone is extensively exposed in a low range of hills\r\na mile or two inland but not over 100 feet above the sea. No elevated\r\nreefs came under my notice between the mouth of the Wailevu river and\r\nNanduri Bay. That a small upheaval has been recently in progress in this\r\npart of the coast is indicated by two circumstances. In the first place\r\nan erosion-line about a couple of feet[8] above the high-water line, and\r\na few paces removed from it, is displayed in the volcanic tuff of the\r\npoint bordering the reef-flat on the east side of Nanduri Bay. In the\r\nnext place there exist at different places in the midst of the\r\nmangrove-belt extensive bare mud-flats, sometimes several hundred yards\r\nacross, which are only covered by the higher tides. These flats are\r\nquite bare of mangrove or any other vegetation and are often cracked on\r\nthe surface and sun-dried and firm to walk upon.[9] These naked\r\nmud-flats in the midst of the mangrove tracts are peculiar to this part\r\nof the coast. Their general level must be between one and two feet above\r\nthat of the mangrove belt in other parts of the island; and I infer that\r\na slight upheaval or emergence has led to the death of the mangroves in\r\nthese situations.\r\n\r\nI know little of the coast between Nanduri Bay and the mouth of the\r\nNdreketi River. At two localities where I landed no elevated\r\nreef-formation was observed. Dana referring to the coast opposite\r\nMathuata Island alludes only to the volcanic agglomerates. The low\r\nmangrove-bordered coast between the mouths of the Ndreketi and Lekutu\r\nrivers was not actually visited by me; but I traversed the region behind\r\nthe broad mangrove-belt, and found occasionally in the tuffs and muds\r\nexposed in the river-banks marine-shells and foraminiferous tests,\r\nindicating an elevation of a few feet. I examined much of the coast\r\nbetween Lekutu and the extremity of the Naivaka peninsula, but came upon\r\nno upraised reef-rocks. In the low isthmus, 20 to 30 feet high, which\r\nconnects this peninsula with the main island only volcanic rocks came\r\nunder my notice. A palagonitic tufaceous sandstone exposed in the cliffs\r\non the north coast of Naivaka contains a little carbonate of lime, and\r\nbeing probably a submarine deposit it implies an emergence of the\r\nsea-border.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have been able to produce but scanty evidence of uplifted\r\nreefs on the north coast of Vanua Levu, it is probable, judging from the\r\nheights given in the Admiralty Sailing Directions, that such formations\r\nexist in a few of the numerous low islands and islets that front this\r\ncoast. Some of these islands and islets, which are often not much more\r\nthan reef-patches largely reclaimed by the mangroves, will be noticed\r\nbelow when considering the question of the extension of the mangrove\r\nbelts since the survey of Commodore Wilkes in 1840.\r\n\r\nNeither on the south coast of the peninsula of Naivaka nor on the west\r\ncoast of the Sesaleka promontory did upraised reefs come under my\r\nobservation; but my acquaintance with the last locality is very scanty.\r\nThe emergence of the Sesaleka promontory is however indicated by the\r\noccurrence inland at heights of at least 700 feet of palagonitic tuffs,\r\noccasionally containing foraminifera.\r\n\r\nWith the long tract of coast between Naithombothombo Point and Solevu\r\nBay, I am fairly well acquainted. However, with the doubtful exception\r\nof Lekumbi Point, no elevated reef-formations were observed. Evidence of\r\nan emergence of a few feet, and of a very extensive seaward advance of\r\nthe land-surface in recent times, is afforded by a curious bed of marine\r\nshells exposed in the banks of the Mbua River, nearly two miles inland\r\nand in the vicinity of the Wesleyan Mission station. This is described\r\non page 58. The submergence at some period of the watershed between the\r\nMbua and Lekutu districts is indicated by the presence of microscopic\r\nforaminifera in the hyalomelan tuffs that are exposed in the dividing\r\nridge.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole coast between the mouth of the Mbua River and Solevu\r\nBay, there are but few if any traces of upheaval. Even volcanic tuffs\r\nare of rare occurrence, and there is only the case of the formation of\r\nLekumbi Point to be here referred to. This singular low cape is\r\ndescribed on page 60. Here it is sufficient to remark that it is\r\nmonopolised by the mangroves except at the outer part where the swampy\r\nground passes into the dry sandy soil of a reef-islet, occupied by the\r\nusual littoral vegetation, and raised only a foot or two above the\r\nhigh-water level. It exhibits on the beach the bedded sand-rock so often\r\nfound on coral islets, but this in itself is no evidence of emergence.\r\n\r\nNeither on the shores of Wainunu Bay nor in the Kumbulau peninsula were\r\nupraised reefs observed, although the presence in places of submarine\r\ntuffs inland and near the coast affords evidence of elevation. The same\r\nremark applies to the coasts of Savu-savu Bay.\r\n\r\nI have little doubt that the absence of elevated reefs on the coasts of\r\nby far the greater part of the island is the result largely of\r\ndenudation. In this case we have to explain why an island in a region of\r\ncoral reefs exhibits on the surface of its interior submarine tuffs and\r\nclays in most localities, whilst uplifted reefs are very rarely to be\r\nfound at the coast or in fact anywhere. This view receives support from\r\nthe existence of traces of old elevated reefs in different parts of the\r\nisland. These traces are afforded by the occurrence on the surface in\r\ndifferent localities of silicified fragments of coral associated with\r\nconcretions of chalcedony, bits of flints and hornstones, jasper, impure\r\nsiliceous nodules, &c. The localities may be at the coast or a mile or\r\ntwo inland, and are not usually more than 100 or 200 feet above the sea.\r\nThis subject is treated with some detail in Chapter XXV. Here I may say\r\nthat such localities are confined mostly to the open, low, undulating\r\ndistricts on the north side of the island. Silicified corals are not\r\nalways present with the fragments of chalcedony and other siliceous\r\nconcretions that are found so frequently in these situations; but from\r\ntheir association in the plains of Kalikoso, where the silicification of\r\ncorals may almost be observed in operation, the previous existence of\r\ncorals may be more than suspected in localities where only the other\r\nsiliceous materials are observed.\r\n\r\nI pass on now to some general considerations regarding the relations of\r\nthe mangrove-belt to the sea-border and the character of the slope of\r\nthe land-surface as compared with that of the submarine platform. An\r\naccurate conception respecting these matters will help one to avoid some\r\npitfalls in forming an estimate of the character of the movement of\r\nemergence which this region has experienced.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the mangrove-belt, some curious preliminary reflections\r\narise, when we endeavour to look back into the past stages of the\r\nhistory of a mangrove tract in an area of emergence. We might perhaps\r\nexpect to find the remains of such a belt in the upraised sea-borders;\r\nor if no traces existed, we ought to find in some places an extension\r\ninland of the reef-flat on which the mangroves at one time flourished.\r\nIf a rapid movement of emergence is now in progress, the mangroves ought\r\nto cover the whole or greater part of the reef-flat; and in the mangrove\r\ntract of an emerging area we might look for signs of central decay and\r\nmarginal growth, the mangroves dying in the middle of the tract and\r\nflourishing at the advancing margins.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we look at the mangrove-belt, as it at present exists\r\naround much of the coast of this island, we find that, except in the\r\nvicinity of the mouths of rivers, there extends beyond it a considerable\r\nextent of bare reef-flat, varying usually between 200 and 1,000 yards in\r\nwidth, and covered by the rising tide. There is no evidence of recent\r\nemergence in this condition of things. This relation between the\r\nmangrove-belt and the reef-flat indicates a state of equilibrium which\r\nmight have been established long ago. It is the normal relation that\r\nexists between reef and mangrove growth; and it excludes all but very\r\ngradual movements of upheaval or emergence of the sea-border. It is not\r\nalways easy to see why there should be this fine adjustment between the\r\nrapidly-growing mangrove and the slowly-growing reef. Under normal\r\nconditions, however, that is to say, when the land is stationary or when\r\nthe change of level is of a very gradual nature, the reclaiming agency\r\nof the mangrove receives a check, and this relation between the\r\nmangrove-belt and the outer reef-flat is maintained.\r\n\r\nActual acquaintance with such localities soon forced me to the\r\nconclusion that whilst a gradual emergence or upheaval of 3 or 4 feet in\r\na century would not materially affect the relation between the\r\nmangrove-belt and the reef-flat, a sudden or rapid change of level of\r\nthat amount would destroy the mangroves around the whole island. There\r\nis some evidence, however, of there having been a rapid upheaval of this\r\nkind in different parts of the coast: and it follows, therefore, if this\r\nmovement was general, that the present mangrove-belts date only from the\r\nlast upheaval. But this elevation may have occurred ages ago; and the\r\nequilibrium between mangrove-belt and reef-flat may have been long since\r\nestablished. Accordingly, the breadth of the mangrove-belt can afford no\r\nindication of the period that has since elapsed. From data referred to\r\nbelow, it is evident that the mangrove-belt, taking its average width,\r\naway from the estuaries, at about 500 yards, might have been formed in\r\ntwo or three centuries, whilst a thousand years or more may have passed\r\nsince it assumed its present relation to the reef-flat. If, therefore,\r\nupheaval is in progress, it must be of a very gradual character, since\r\nthe normal relation of mangrove-belt to reef-flat now prevails.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed signs of such a gradual movement of emergence or of\r\nelevation being in operation on the north coast of Vanua Levu at the\r\npresent time. I have before referred (page 11) to the extensive bare\r\nmud-flats in the midst of the mangrove-belt between Nanduri and Lambasa,\r\nwhich are well represented on the Tambia coast and in Nanduri Bay. They\r\nare only covered by the higher tides, and in the intervals their\r\nsurfaces are dried and cracked by exposure to the sun. Here we have the\r\ncentral decay and the marginal growth which would be expected in a\r\nmangrove tract situated in a gradually rising area.\r\n\r\nAn indirect indication of such a slow upheaval on the north coast is to\r\nbe found in the circumstance that the great submarine platform, which\r\nreaches seaward to the line of barrier-reefs, 15 to 20 miles away,\r\npasses gradually, as it extends landward, into the low-lying plains that\r\nconstitute the sea-border between Lekutu and Ravi-ravi Point. As shown\r\nin the profile-section on p. 62, these low coast districts are prolonged\r\ninland, with an average rise of between 20 and 30 feet in a mile, to the\r\nheart of the island; and we have here an extension inland of the slope\r\nof the submarine platform. These broad inland plains, and I may here\r\ninclude those behind Lambasa, are covered over much of their surface\r\nwith submarine tuffs and clays in such a manner that we may almost trace\r\ntheir continuity at the coast with similar deposits now in actual\r\nformation beyond the low-water level on the surface of the submarine\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map of the island, where these inland plains are\r\nindicated by the 300 feet of the contour-line, will make this point more\r\nclear. These plains are traversed by the Sarawanga, Ndreketi, Wailevu,\r\nand Lambasa rivers; and so slight is the fall that cutters usually\r\nascend the rivers for several miles, whilst the tide extends for a\r\nconsiderable distance up their courses. That the emergence of the inland\r\nplains of Kalikoso in the eastern part of the island is comparatively\r\nrecent there can be but little doubt. In that locality as described on\r\npage 224, the low marshy land, surrounding the fresh-water lake of\r\nVakalalatha, although five miles inland, is only elevated 20 to 30 feet\r\nor less above the sea, and silicified corals are scattered over its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThere is one other method of ascertaining the character and amount of\r\nelevation that may be still in progress in this island namely the\r\ncomparison of the results of surveys of the coasts at different periods.\r\nIn this manner data may be obtained as regards the growth of the\r\nmangrove belt, changes in size of the low reef-islets and islands, and\r\nalterations in depth. For this purpose I have employed the charts of the\r\nnorth and west coasts of the island made by Commodore Wilkes in 1840[10]\r\nand the Admiralty charts 379 and 382 as completed from the survey of\r\nthese coasts by Commander Combe in 1895-96.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to make many good comparisons in the case of the advance\r\nof the mangrove-belt of the main coast. There certainly has been no\r\ngreat advance seaward of the margin of the mangroves in this half\r\ncentury. The average amount probably lies between the estimate obtained\r\nfor the coast opposite Mathuata Island, where there has either been no\r\nchange or an advance of only 100 yards or so, and that for the advance\r\nseaward of the mangrove promontory of Lekutu which amounts to 500 or 600\r\nyards. In this last case, however, much of the extension may be due to\r\nthe advance of the mangroves on the mud brought down by the Lekutu\r\nriver, so that, as far as these data show, the average advance of the\r\nbelt of mangroves on this coast between 1840 and 1895 would appear to be\r\nslight.[11]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the mangrove-borders of the several low islands and\r\nislets, mainly formed of reef-_débris_, that lie off the coast, have\r\noften extended themselves during this period in a marked degree. The\r\nresults of my comparisons are given below, the rate of advance being\r\nobtained by halving the increase in length or breadth as measured\r\nbetween the mangrove-borders, the breadth being used in the long\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n _Advance of the Mangrove-Borders of Low Islands on the North Coast of\r\n                   Vanua Levu between 1840 and 1895._\r\n\r\n Thukini, or Gibson Island of Wilkes    700 to 800 yards\r\n Nangano, or Piner’s Island of Wilkes   300 to 400   \"\r\n Nandongo, or Nuvera of Wilkes                 500   \"\r\n Talailau (two new islands)             400 to 900   \"\r\n Nukunuku or Clark’s Island of Wilkes } Not much change.\r\n Thakavi, or Day’s Island of Wilkes   }\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the islands of the Talailau Reef are not marked\r\nin the chart of 1840; they are both low mangrove islands, the largest\r\nbeing slightly under a mile long and the smallest a little under half a\r\nmile. In Nukuira Island, the Vatou of Wilkes, there has been a decrease\r\nof about two-thirds of a mile during this period. The difference between\r\nThukini in 1840 and in 1895 is very noticeable. In the time of Wilkes\r\nthe mangroves only occupied about one-third of the reef-patch. Now they\r\noccupy about two-thirds, the area of the reef-patch remaining much about\r\nthe same. Taking the minus and plus values of all the islands here\r\nmeasured, the average rate of the advance of the mangrove-margins during\r\nthis half-century may be placed at about 250 yards in the case of these\r\nreef-islands, which would amount to a mile in 400 years.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that a long island like Ndongo, which is about four miles\r\nin length, has been formed by the union of smaller mangrove islands.\r\nTherefore, taking half its maximum breadth of a mile as a guide, it\r\nwould at this average rate of growth require two centuries for its\r\nformation. But since the extension of the mangroves depends on the\r\ngrowth of the reef-patch, which takes place on the average at a much\r\nslower rate, it follows that this can only be a minimum limit for the\r\nage of this island. We can only assume that if the reef-patch had\r\nsuddenly appeared 200 years ago, Ndongo Island could by this time have\r\nacquired its present dimensions. It does not follow that the mangrove\r\nborder has been continuously advancing. A hundred years ago there may\r\nhave been a state of equilibrium between the growth of the mangrove and\r\nthe reef-patch, which does not now exist. All we can say of some of\r\nthese low islands is that the mangroves have been rapidly extending\r\ntheir margins during the last half century, and that the normal\r\nadjustment between reef-growth and mangrove-growth, which must have once\r\nexisted, does not now prevail.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence of the shoaling of the ship channel amongst these\r\nislands to the extent of about a fathom during this period.[12] The\r\nusual depth immediately around the patches, on which the islands have\r\nbeen formed, is 8 to 10 fathoms. If, therefore, the shoaling is a\r\ngeneral process, it is to be inferred that although the outward growth\r\nof the reef-patches would be usually very slow, probably not over fifty\r\nyards in a century, there must be times when, in shallowing depths, the\r\ngrowth of the reef-patch would be comparatively rapid; and it is at such\r\ntimes that the adjustment between the relations of mangrove and\r\nreef-patch would be upset so that the advance of the mangroves would be\r\nfor a time unrestricted.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, apparent that the rate of growth of one of these low\r\nislands is not to be determined by the rate of growth of the\r\nmangrove-tract occupying the surface. The subject is a complicated one;\r\nbut I think enough has been said to show that the destructive agencies\r\ndo not prevail on this great submarine platform on the north coast of\r\nVanua Levu.\r\n\r\nIf the data here adduced of the increase of the low islands, of the\r\nshoaling of the channels, and of the advance of the delta of the Lekutu\r\nriver,[13] are well founded, all the islands, islets, and reef-patches\r\nthat lie along this north coast will be united to each other and to the\r\nmain island within a thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe facts here produced do not directly indicate a movement of upheaval\r\nbut they are quite consistent with the conclusion that the great\r\nmovement of elevation which has built up Vanua Levu by the union of\r\nseveral smaller islands is still in operation at its coasts. To assume\r\nthat there is now in progress at the sea-border the same process of\r\nisland-building which has produced Vanua Levu, as we now see it, is to\r\nassume a uniformity in nature’s methods which is disregarded by the\r\nhypothesis that the great submarine platform, from which the large\r\nislands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu now arise, represents the work of\r\nmarine erosion into the flanks of the upheaved islands since the last\r\nelevation. The origin of this submarine platform is dealt with in\r\nChapter XXVII. Here it may be remarked that I regard it as older than\r\nthe islands that rise from it.\r\n\r\nHowever, this movement of upheaval is so gradual that the utmost one can\r\nexpect to do by the comparison of surveys made half a century apart is\r\nto show the lack of evidence of the destructive agency of erosion. As\r\nfar as the comparison admits of judging, there seems to have been no\r\nimportant change on the coasts of the western end of the island during\r\nthis period. The low neck of land connecting Naivaka with the main\r\nisland, if we take the low-water line in the Admiralty chart as the\r\nlimit, had much the same breadth at the time of both surveys. The depths\r\nin Mbua Bay remain about the same, with perhaps a shoaling of less than\r\na fathom in places. There are two cays awash in the Admiralty plan of\r\nthis bay which were described as sand-spits in the time of Wilkes. The\r\npromontory of Lekumbi could scarcely have been expected to show any\r\nextension during this time, since there are depths of 10 to 16 fathoms\r\nclose to its extremity; and there is in fact no difference of critical\r\nimportance indicated in the charts.\r\n\r\nSome of the principal points of this chapter may be thus summed up:—\r\n\r\n(1) Upraised reef-limestones are of very limited occurrence. They occur\r\nat and near the coast and do not extend higher than 300 feet. Their\r\nscarcity at the sea-border is to be attributed to the denuding agencies.\r\n\r\n(2) Since foraminiferous muds and sedimentary tuffs with marine organic\r\nremains occur at all elevations up to over 2000 feet, it is assumed that\r\nthe absence of reef-limestones in the elevated interior indicates the\r\npaucity or absence of reef-growths in the early stages of the history of\r\nthe island. The overlying agglomerates have often preserved from\r\ndestruction the soft sedimentary deposits beneath; but they seem to have\r\nnever covered over a coral reef.\r\n\r\n(3) The relation between the mangrove-belt and the reef-flat indicates a\r\nstate of equilibrium which might have been established long ago. If the\r\nmovement of emergence is still in progress, it must therefore be of a\r\nvery gradual nature, since the normal relation between the mangrove-belt\r\nand reef-flat now prevails.\r\n\r\n(4) From the circumstance that the submarine platform passes with a\r\nuniform slope into the low-lying plains, covered with submarine\r\ndeposits, it may be inferred that a very gradual emergence is now in\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n(5) A comparison of the charts of Wilkes and of the British Admiralty\r\nshows that on the north coast of the island during the last half century\r\nthe destructive agencies of marine erosion have not prevailed.\r\n\r\n(6) The results of the comparison of the charts, whilst they do not\r\ndirectly imply a change of level, are quite consistent with the\r\nconclusion that the movement of emergence, which has been in operation\r\nprobably since the later Tertiary period, is not suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note._—The extensive evidence of emergence presented by this island is\r\ntreated in Chapter XXVII. in connection with the whole group. It is not\r\nalways possible to avoid in such a discussion the use of terms such as\r\n“upheaval” and “subsidence,” although there is much to be said for the\r\nterms “negative” and “positive” employed by Suess. In the present\r\nchapter, however, I have avoided committing myself definitely to any\r\nview relating to the stability either of the land or of the sea,\r\nreserving the consideration of the subject for Chapter XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                     THE HOT SPRINGS OF VANUA LEVU\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE abundance of hot springs in Vanua Levu, and in fact in the group\r\ngenerally, is not commonly known. In the earlier accounts of these\r\nislands those of Savu-savu are often alone referred to, not only for\r\nthis island but for the whole archipelago. The United States Exploring\r\nExpedition under Wilkes spent six months in 1840 in making a survey of\r\nthe whole group. Yet Dana, who was attached to the expedition, remarks\r\nthat “the only trace of actual volcanic heat which the islands appear to\r\ncontain is found at Savu-savu Bay.”[14] Horne in his excellent account\r\nof the group, which he visited in 1878, was among the first to direct\r\nattention to the abundance of hot springs there; but he does not\r\nenumerate many. Although he travelled extensively over Vanua Levu, he\r\nrefers to only three in that island, namely, at Savu-savu, Wainunu, and\r\nVunisawana.[15] It will be shown below that most of the thermal springs\r\ndiscovered by me might easily have been overlooked.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with those of Vanua Levu I will mention the other\r\nlocalities in the group in which thermal springs are from various\r\nsources known to me. They probably form but a small proportion of those\r\nthat actually exist; but the list can be readily extended by those\r\nacquainted with special parts of the archipelago. In Viti Levu they\r\noccur amongst other places at Wai Mbasanga, on the Singatoka river\r\n(Horne) and at Na Seivau on the Wai Ndina, where Macdonald in 1856 found\r\ntemperatures of 106° and 140° Fahr. in two different springs.[16] Mr.\r\nThiele in more recent years referred by hearsay to some hot springs on\r\nthe Wai Ndina.[17] Kleinschmidt in 1876 visited a hot spring near the\r\nvillage of Nambualu in the island of Ono which rose up in the midst of a\r\nbrook and had a temperature of about 100° Fahr.[18] The same naturalist\r\nin July of that year, when accompanied by Dr. Max Büchner, came upon a\r\nhot spring issuing among the mangroves at the coast about a mile from\r\nthe village of Ndavingele in Kandavu. He did not take the temperature;\r\nbut he says that Colonel Smythe (about 1860) observed the temperature to\r\nbe 144° Fahr.[19] Different writers refer to extensive hot springs on\r\nthe island of Ngau. They are placed near the beach, and close to an\r\nordinary cool spring. Miss Gordon Cumming in _At Home in Fiji_ gives an\r\nillustration of them. Horne mentions a hot spring on the island of\r\nRambi. Andrews describes two others that bubble up through the limestone\r\nnear the tidal zone in the southern part of Vanua Mbalavu. Both these\r\nsprings are in close proximity to the junction line between the intruded\r\nandesite and the old reef rock. One of them, though not boiling, was hot\r\nenough to scald the skin.[20] This list is no doubt capable of being\r\nmuch extended, especially for Viti Levu and the Lau Group.\r\n\r\nA description of the several systems of thermal springs of Vanua Levu\r\nwill now be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE HOT SPRINGS OF THE LOWER VALLEY OF THE WAINUNU RIVER.—This is one\r\nof the most extensive systems of the kind in the island. The temperature\r\nof the various springs during my sojourn in this district in 1898 ranged\r\nfrom 100° to 130° Fahr. Those known to me are mostly situated in the\r\nlower part and at the mouth of the Ndavutu Creek, one of the tributaries\r\nof the Wainunu. They open usually on the river-bank, either close to the\r\nwater or a few feet above it, but some of them find an exit under water\r\nat the bottom of the river. Natives allege that hot springs occur at\r\nintervals on the left bank and at the river-bottom along the whole\r\nlength of the river below Ndavutu Creek. There is certainly a hot spring\r\non the right side of the river’s mouth near Mr. Dyer’s house. It issues\r\nfrom the reef-flat and can only be observed at exceptionally low tides.\r\nThere is also a hot spring which rises up at the edge of the stream at\r\nThongea (Cogea) nearly a mile above Ndavutu. If the above statement of\r\nthe natives is correct, as I believe it is, then these thermal springs\r\nissue along a line quite four geographical miles in length extending\r\ninland from the mouth of the Wainunu.\r\n\r\nAll the springs are situated in the tidal part of the river-valley, with\r\nthe exception of that of Thongea, which is just above this limit. They\r\nare but little elevated above the sea-level, those exposed being usually\r\nnot more than ten feet above the river and often much less. This is a\r\nregion of basalt, the valley of the Wainunu lying, as described on page\r\n82, in the fold between two great basaltic flows, and probably\r\nrepresenting a line of weakness, along which the hot springs issue\r\neither from among loose blocks, or from the soil, or from a tufaceous\r\nsandstone. They deposit little if any of the siliceous sinter which is\r\noften found in the thermal waters of this island. This is due probably\r\nto their scanty exposure and to their low temperature. The density of\r\nthe water is near that of fresh water, being not over 1001. The\r\nfollowing temperatures may be useful for comparison with future\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\n Thongea, when not covered by the stream             July, 1898, 127° F.\r\n Ndavutu, bath-spring at Mr. Barratt’s house             Usually 100° \"\r\n  \" on left bank of the creek near the landing place June, 1898, 126° \"\r\n  \" on left bank of creek near mouth                 Dec.     \"  127° \"\r\n  \" pool in foot-path on left bank                 { June 2,  \"  112° \"\r\n                                                   { July 27, \"  111° \"\r\n  \" at bottom of main river in depth of 3 feet,  }\r\n     close to the left bank and just above the   }   July     \"  122° \"\r\n     mouthof the Ndavutu creek, self-registering }\r\n     Six thermometer used                        }\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Hot Springs of Natoarau and its Vicinity.—This thermal system\r\nlies in the lower valley of the Mbale-mbale branch of the river\r\nNdreke-ni-wai. The principal springs are situated at Natoarau, a village\r\nabout half a mile in a direct line from Mbale-mbale, about three miles\r\nfrom the coast, and only about fifty feet above the sea. They bubble up\r\nin pools near brooks, and extend at intervals over an area probably\r\nseveral hundred yards across. Five springs came under my notice; but\r\nthere are doubtless several others in the low-lying and often swampy\r\nland of this district. No deposits were noticed, but the mode of\r\noccurrence and low temperature of the springs serve to explain this\r\nfact. The following temperature observations were made by me in March,\r\n1899:—\r\n\r\n A. Pool 4 feet across, with sides of stone, close to village 126° F.\r\n B. Pool 10 feet wide, a few paces from pool A                114° \"\r\n C. Pool 12 feet wide, 100 yards from village, near the river 103° \"\r\n D. Pool on the road to Mbale-mbale, mixed with surface water 100° \"\r\n\r\nThe natives and others often state that the thermal springs here and in\r\nother localities are much hotter in dry than in rainy weather. This is\r\ncorrect in a sense, because in wet weather the surface water would\r\nusually find access to the pools; but there is no reason to believe that\r\nthe temperature of the water at the hole of exit varies at all from this\r\ncause. The temperature of pool A was taken at the bottom where the water\r\nbubbled up; and probably it represents the true degree of heat of these\r\nsprings, since in the other cases observation of this point was not so\r\neasy. The weather was dry during this visit; but, three months before, I\r\ntested the temperature of this pool after heavy rain, when the district\r\nwas flooded, and then I got a reading of 127° at the exit-hole of the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nAnother thermal spring, which is distant about a mile from Natoarau, is\r\nknown as Waitunutunu, that is, Warm Water. It lies about a third of a\r\nmile from the village of Nambuniseseri, between Mbale-mbale and Waisali,\r\nand is quite four miles inland and about 100 feet above the sea. The\r\nsprings bubble up into a pool, about 12 feet across, which is close to a\r\nbrook and had a temperature in March, 1899, of 109-112° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE HOT SPRINGS OF NUKUMBOLO.—The village of Nukumbolo, where the\r\nsprings are situated, lies on the banks of a tributary of the Vatu-kawa\r\nbranch of the river Ndreke-ni-wai, and is distant as the crow flies\r\nabout six miles inland from the river’s mouth. The springs issue on a\r\nhill-slope from several places a few steps apart, and are removed about\r\na hundred yards from the river, and from 20 to 30 feet above it. Their\r\nelevation above the sea would be about 130 feet. The temperature taken\r\nin the two hottest places was 157° F, in November 1898, and 158° in the\r\nfollowing February. As in the case of the springs of Savu-savu and a few\r\nother localities, the rocks are coated with siliceous sinter mixed with\r\ncarbonate of lime, and a gelatinous incrusting alga grows on the borders\r\nof tiny hollows bathed often in water of a temperature 137-140°, but\r\nthriving most where the temperature is 115-120°. The water runs down the\r\nslope into a series of pools made by the natives for bathing, the\r\ntemperature of the lowest pool being 103-105° and of the highest 120°.\r\nThis is one of the best localities I have seen in the island for the\r\nerection of thermal baths. The rock pierced by the springs is apparently\r\na basic agglomerate-tuff. Large blocks of a hard and somewhat altered\r\npalagonitic tuff lie around the bathing pools.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE BOILING SPRINGS OF SAVU-SAVU.—These springs figure in all the\r\ndescriptions of the group, and they are also famous amongst the natives.\r\nSince they were described by Wilkes, who visited them in 1840, in his\r\nnarrative of the United States Exploring Expedition, many accounts of\r\nthem have been written by subsequent visitors; not infrequently they\r\nhave been sketched as well as described; and several analyses of their\r\nwaters have been made.[21] The accounts of these springs that lie before\r\nme extend at intervals over a period of nearly sixty years; but I shall\r\nallude to them only so far as they throw light on the history of the\r\nsprings during this period.\r\n\r\nThe principal springs are situated in a slight hollow in a more or less\r\nlevel tract extending in from the beach, and are distant about 150 yards\r\nfrom the shore and about ten feet above the sea-level. They are five or\r\nsix in number, and at the time of my visits in July and November, 1898,\r\nthey were boiling briskly, the thermometer readings being 208-210° F.,\r\nbut the mercury probably fell two or three degrees in withdrawing the\r\nthermometer. When, as was the case when Wilkes visited this locality in\r\n1840, there is but a slight appearance of boiling, brisk ebullition is\r\nproduced by covering them over with leaves. The natives call this\r\nlocality Na Kama, which signifies “the burning place,” and employed the\r\nsprings extensively for cooking their food. Just as Wilkes describes, a\r\nfreshwater brook runs past the springs and receives their outflow. The\r\ntemperature of the brook immediately above the springs is that of an\r\nordinary freshwater stream 75-76° F.; but below it is scalding. The\r\naccount given by Wilkes of the spring and of the brook in 1840 applies\r\nto them in our own time. The small stones lying in the effluent channels\r\nof the springs are incrusted with siliceous sinter, and a green alga\r\nlines the sides, bathed generally in the steam but sometimes partially\r\nimmersed in water only a few degrees below the boiling point. It is\r\nnoteworthy that this alga which was flourishing in July was all dead in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nThe scalding water also oozes through the sand of the adjacent beach in\r\nabundance for a distance of at least some hundreds of yards. It is even\r\nstated that as far as Ndaku, a mile to the westward, the hot springs\r\nissue at intervals through the beach.[22] There are evidently also\r\nextensive submarine springs close to the beach; and probably Wilkes was\r\nnot far from the truth when he remarked that the “whole area of\r\nhalf-a-mile square seems to be covered with hot springs.”\r\n\r\nOff the beach, a few hundred yards to the westward of the springs, is a\r\nbatch of dead reef formed of massive corals and only approachable from\r\nthe shore at extreme low-tide when it is a little exposed. From numerous\r\nsmall holes and cracks in the dead-coral hot water issues almost at the\r\nboiling point (210° F). It is apparent that these springs have appeared\r\nat this particular spot since the corals grew. But it is remarkable that\r\nthis has been apparently going on since the visit of Wilkes in 1840. He\r\nrefers to a coral rock, distant one-third of a mile from the springs and\r\n150 feet from the beach, through which boiling water was issuing in\r\nseveral places. This rock which was then 10 feet wide and 20 feet long,\r\nwas at his visit exposed for three feet at low-tide and covered at\r\nhigh-tide.[23]\r\n\r\nThe geological characters of this locality are described on page 191. I\r\nmay here remark that if these thermal springs occupy the position of an\r\nold crater, it would require much imaginative power to restore it now.\r\nThe off-lying small island of Nawi might by its situation appear to\r\ncountenance this idea, but I found no special indication, when I\r\nexamined it, in support of this view. From the geological character of\r\nthe district, I would infer that if a crater once existed here it was\r\nsubmarine and that it has been long since obliterated by marine and\r\naërial denudation. The boiling springs come up through apparently a\r\nrotten volcanic agglomerate. The slight hollow of three or four feet\r\ndeep, in which they lie, was considered by Kleinschmidt to be an old\r\ncrater cavity; but it is only 40 or 50 feet across, and in the earlier\r\ndescriptions the hollow is described as surrounded by a mound of earth.\r\nAs shown below, the natives themselves may be held responsible for many\r\nchanges in the surface around the springs. There is, in fact, no trace\r\nof a crateral cavity in this district now.\r\n\r\nI will now briefly notice the history of the boiling springs since 1840,\r\nwhen they were visited by Commodore Wilkes. At that time there were five\r\nsprings, situated in a basin 40 feet across, and possessing a\r\ntemperature of 200-210° F. Although there was scarcely any appearance of\r\nboiling, rapid ebullition could be excited by covering the springs with\r\nleaves and grass. The natives alleged that the springs had always been\r\nin the same condition. In 1863, when the Chief of Wainunu (Tui Wainunu)\r\ncame to fight the Savu-savu people, he endeavoured but without success\r\nto choke up the springs by heaping earth over them. I was informed of\r\nthis circumstance by Mr. A. H. Barrack, the owner of the springs. Miss\r\nGordon Cumming also refers to it in her book _At Home in Fiji_. When\r\nthis lady visited the springs in August, 1876, they were intermittent in\r\ntheir action, the highest making a fountain two to three feet high.\r\nAccording to the description of Kleinschmidt they were in the same\r\nintermittent condition in May of the same year. There were then four\r\nsprings situated in a bowl-shaped hollow. The two larger springs were\r\nnot constantly bubbling up, but displayed periodic ebullitions of about\r\ntwenty minutes’ duration, the waters disappearing in the intervals. The\r\nother two springs were not then active. Horne, who visited this locality\r\nin 1878, refers to three or four principal springs situated in the\r\ncentre of a hollow, which was surrounded by a mound of earth, the water\r\nboiling up to the height of about a foot.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the springs entered for a while into a new phase of\r\naction and assumed the form of geysers. According to information\r\nreceived from Mr. A. H. Barrack and other old residents in Savu-savu,\r\nthe waters spouted up to a height of from 40 to 60 feet, not vertically\r\nbut at an angle. Each outburst, which lasted for ten or twenty minutes,\r\nwas followed by a similar interval of repose, during which the springs\r\ndried up. This continued for a month or two, after which the springs\r\ngradually resumed their normal level. When I visited the springs in July\r\nand November, 1898, they were boiling briskly, attaining a height of a\r\nfew inches, and showed no signs of intermittent action.\r\n\r\nI come now to the different analyses that have been made of the water of\r\nthese thermal springs of Savu-savu. Specimens have been analysed at\r\ndifferent times by chemists in various parts of the world, in America,\r\nin Germany, in Australia, etc., and the results as far as known to me\r\nare now appended.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. _Analysis by Dr. C.

The dissolved salts amounted to “8·48 g. per\r\nlitre,” and the remark is made that “the concentration is therefore not\r\nso great as in sea-water.” The solid constituents consisted in by far\r\nthe greatest part of Natrium and Calcium chlorides. A quantitative\r\ndetermination, which on account of the small quantity of the water was\r\nconfined to “eine Chlor und Kalkbestimmung,” gave this result:—\r\n\r\n Chlor (Chlorine)      4·79 g. per litre.\r\n Kalk (Lime)           2·31 \"   \"\r\n\r\nReckoned as Chlornatrium (Kocksalz) and Chlorcalcium, these results were\r\nobtained:—\r\n\r\n Chlorcalcium (Calcium chloride)      4·55 g. per litre.\r\n Chlornatrium (Sodium chloride)       3·09 \"  \"\r\n\r\nAmongst other constituents found in small quantities were Sulphuric\r\nacid, Silicic acid (Kieselsäure), Potash, and Iron oxide.

This is considerably less than\r\nthe salts in solution in sea-water, namely 35 grains per thousand. The\r\nrelative proportions of the salts, excepting those of calcium, do not\r\nvary more than we should expect in the case of analyses made by varying\r\nmethods and probably with a varying degree of exactness.\r\n\r\nDana[29] considered from Dr. Jackson’s analysis that the water of the\r\nSavu-savu springs is probably of marine origin; but the absence of\r\nbromine and iodine, as especially remarked by Dr. Pieper and Prof.\r\nLiversidge does not support this view. We might also expect the\r\nproportion of the salts to each other to show a greater similarity to\r\nthat in sea-water than they do. On the other hand the total volume of\r\nwater discharged, not only by the springs proper but for several hundred\r\nyards along the beach, and also between the tide-marks and beyond, must\r\nbe far greater than could be supplied by the rainfall of this portion of\r\nthe Savu-savu peninsula, which is only one and a half to two miles\r\nacross and 800 feet high. We must look, I think, for the source of these\r\nwaters in deep subterranean streams or artesian basins that would be fed\r\nby the rains precipitated in the mountainous districts where the\r\nrainfall amounts to at least 200-300 inches in the year. This matter is\r\nfurther discussed in my general remarks on the hot-springs of this\r\nisland (page 38).\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE HOT SPRINGS NEAR RAVUKA.—These springs rise up in the centre of\r\nthe breadth of the island about nine miles direct from the coast. They\r\nare about 200 feet above the sea and are situated on the Ndrawa branch\r\nof the Ndreketi River some two miles below the hamlet of Ravuka. They\r\nare on a small scale and ooze through a bed of rounded blocks and\r\npebbles close to the water on the left bank. Their temperature in\r\nAugust, 1898, was 148° F. They are covered by the river when it is\r\nswollen by the rains, and very probably other hot-springs issue along\r\nthe river-bottom. The conditions are not suitable for the formation of\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE HOT SPRINGS OF VUINASANGA.—These thermal springs are also\r\nsituated in the heart of the island on a tributary of the Ndreketi some\r\nthree or four miles westward from Va Lili and about 150 feet above the\r\nsea. On each bank of the river four or five paces from the water and\r\nthree or four feet above it, there is a small pool two to four feet\r\nwide. In June, 1899, the pool on the right bank had a temperature of\r\n131° F., and that on the left bank of 134°. There were no deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. THE HOT SPRINGS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE NAWAVI RANGE.—These springs\r\nalso lie within the borders of the valley of the Ndreketi. They may be\r\n“located” by describing them as lying a few miles inland from the north\r\ncoast fronted by Mathuata Island. I did not visit them and have only\r\nlearned of them from Mr. Thomson’s Mathuata paper.[30] That gentleman\r\nrefers to them as two in number and situated at the back of the coast\r\nrange about four miles inland from the village of Nangumu; but no\r\nparticulars are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. THE HOT SPRINGS OF VATULOALOA.—These springs lie on the Mathuata\r\nCoast in the neighbourhood of Mathuata Island. I have not seen them, but\r\nam indebted to Mr. Thomson for the particulars here given, which are\r\ntaken from his paper above quoted. Mr. Thomson, who discovered them in\r\n1880, named them the “Graçie” springs. They issue below high-water mark\r\nat Vatuloaloa, and had a temperature in 1880 of about 140° F. They are\r\nsaid to possess many valuable healing qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. THE HOT SPRINGS OF NAMBUONU.—These springs are situated on the same\r\npart of the Mathuata coast as those of Vatuloaloa above referred to. I\r\nlearned from Mr. Bulling of Undu Point that they issue from swampy\r\nground half a mile inland. They were discovered accidentally by a\r\nJapanese who put his foot into them, the temperature being sufficiently\r\nhigh to scald the feet, but not at the boiling-point, probably about\r\n140° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. THE HOT SPRINGS NEAR TAMBIA.—These extensive springs, situate 1½ to\r\n2 miles inland, and rather under 100 feet above the sea, lie near the\r\nMathuata or north coast of the island, some four miles west of the\r\nWailevu river. They rise up in the midst of level country about a mile\r\nfrom the town of Tambia, and near the village of Ngovungovu. Although\r\nsituated in the valley of the Tambia river, these springs are not\r\nadjacent to the river, and in this respect they differ from nearly all\r\nthe inland hot springs. The hottest spring bubbles up into a pool 5 or 6\r\nfeet across, which had a temperature of 180° F., in March, 1899. Near by\r\nis a large deep pool, some 20 feet or more across, with a temperature of\r\n100°. It receives the overflow from the smaller pool, and apparently hot\r\nwater also bubbles up at the bottom. Around the smaller hottest pool\r\nthere is a considerable deposit of what is mainly siliceous sinter. It\r\nincrusts the stones and also the oyster-shells lying about the pool in\r\nquantities, where they have been left by the natives after their\r\ncontents had been cooked and eaten. Some of the shells are almost\r\ndecayed away, the sinter for the most part alone remaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. THE HOT SPRINGS OF VANDRANI.—These springs occur in the heart of the\r\nisland, about 8 miles from the coast in a straight line, and about 270\r\nfeet above the sea. This is the greatest elevation, as far as I know, at\r\nwhich a hot spring exists in this island. Here they rise up near the\r\nbase of the central mountain range, close to the head-waters of the\r\nWailevu river which opens into Lambasa bay. The springs bubble up into a\r\npool, a foot deep, on the left side of the river, four or five paces\r\naway from the water’s edge, and scarcely raised above it. They are\r\ncovered over when the river is in flood. In February, 1899, the\r\ntemperature recorded by my thermometer was 100° F.; but probably it was\r\na few degrees higher at the bottom of the pool. I noticed no deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. THE HOT SPRINGS OF NA KAMA ON THE WAILEVU RIVER.—These boiling\r\nsprings, which are of an extensive character, come up in half-a-dozen\r\nplaces on either bank of the river, and are from 5 to 6 miles inland,\r\nand about 90 feet above the sea. They are close to the water, and from 1\r\nto 10 feet above it. The temperature of one small pool, where the water\r\nbubbled up briskly, was 204° F. in February, 1899. In another it was\r\n194°. The water was probably at the boiling-point in some cases as it\r\nentered the pools, and in the others it could have been only a few\r\ndegrees below it. The rocks of the district are agglomerates and tuffs.\r\nI have no recollection of deposits of any extent around the springs.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. THE HOT SPRINGS OF VUNIMOLI ON THE LAMBASA RIVER.—A few minutes’\r\nwalk from Vunimoli, and about 100 yards from the left bank of the river,\r\nthese hot springs issue in a place named Vunimbele from the\r\nforaminiferous clay rock (soapstone) of the district. They are on the\r\nside of a ditch which communicates with the river. The natives have cut\r\nout of the soft rock small square basins which receive the waters. The\r\ntemperature of the hottest spring in August, 1899, was 155° F. That of\r\nothers was 140°. The conditions are not favourable for the formation of\r\ndeposits. These springs lie about 8 miles inland and are rather over 100\r\nfeet above the sea. They are, however, small and unimportant, and the\r\nlocality in which they occur is now overgrown with vegetation and not\r\neasy to discover.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. THE HOT SPRINGS OF MBATI-NI-KAMA ON THE NGAWA RIVER.—These springs\r\nare situated in the Lambasa district about 7½ miles from the coast, and\r\nrather over 100 feet above the sea. They issue copiously from the\r\nvolcanic agglomerate at a temperature of 161° F. (August, 1899), and are\r\nonly removed a few paces from the river, and a foot or so above it. Algæ\r\nflourish in the water, and siliceous sinter incrusts the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. THE HOT SPRING OF NANDONGO ON THE HEAD-WATERS OF THE WAI-NI-KORO\r\nRIVER.—A few hundred yards from the village and elevated about 180 feet\r\nabove the sea there is a small pool in the clay of the river bank, 2 or\r\n3 feet above and close to the water, which in September, 1899, had a\r\ntemperature of 97° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. THE HOT SPRINGS OF NATUVO ON THE NORTH COAST OF NATEWA BAY.—About a\r\nmile east of Mbiagunu and near the village of Natuvo, there are two hot\r\nsprings of small size which I visited in August, 1899. One that issued\r\non the reef-flat from the coral-rock at a temperature of 136° F. was\r\ncovered over towards high-tide. The other issued near by at a\r\ntemperature of 131° from swampy ground a few paces among the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. THE HOT SPRINGS OF NDAKU-NDAKU ON THE NORTH COAST OF NATEWA BAY.—At\r\nthis place about 2 miles north of Vuinandi some hot springs rise through\r\nthe reef-flat, which are only exposed at low tide. At the time of my\r\nvisit they were covered over by the rising tide. The natives described\r\nthem as not very hot and like the neighbouring hot springs of Natuvo.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. THE HOT SPRING OF NAVAKARAVI, NATEWA BAY.—The coast village thus\r\nnamed lies about one and a half miles north of Were-kamba. The hot\r\nspring is about a mile inland and not over 30 to 40 feet above the sea.\r\nIt is reached after traversing a low and often swampy tract. The spring\r\nin August, 1899, issued from a little rise at a temperature of 133°\r\nFahr., and formed a rivulet 18 inches across.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. THE HOT SPRINGS OF VUNISAWANA AT THE HEAD OF NATEWA BAY.—Mr. Horne,\r\nwho was in this locality in 1878, refers to these springs in his book _A\r\nYear in Fiji_. They had at one time, he remarks, a wide reputation for\r\ntheir curative qualities; but the people around became so poor on\r\naccount of the hospitality that custom compelled them to extend to the\r\nnumerous visitors that they buried up the springs. Mr. Horne was shown\r\nthe site at the bottom of a muddy creek. I saw it in 1898. It lies 300\r\nor 400 yards in from the beach and only a few feet above the sea. There\r\nwere no signs of heat then; but I was told that when the stream close by\r\nis very low it sometimes is a little warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n20. THE HOT SPRING OF NDREKE-NI-WAI ON THE SOUTH COAST OF NATEWA\r\nBAY.—This small spring issues between the tide-marks from an old\r\nreef-patch close to the shore and is only to be seen at low-water. Its\r\ntemperature in May, 1898, was 130-135° Fahr.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. THE HOT SPRING OF WAIKATAKATA ON THE SOUTH COAST OF NATEWA BAY.—This\r\nimportant spring lies about four miles east of the town of Natewa. It\r\nissues on a hill-slope about 400 yards from the beach and is some 25 or\r\n30 feet above the sea; but it is so beset by undergrowth that the source\r\nis not easy to reach. Boulders and blocks of a basaltic rock lie about\r\non the slope; and it is from under a huge boulder of five or six tons in\r\nweight that the spring emerges at a temperature of 148° Fahr. (April,\r\n1898). There is a good volume of water, and a series of bathing pools of\r\nvarying temperature could be readily made. Unlike most of the inland hot\r\nsprings, it is not in connection with a stream or river.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. THE HOT SPRING OF NDEVO ON THE COAST OPPOSITE TO RAMBI.—I did not\r\nhear of any spring when in the locality; but I learned afterwards that\r\nnear a stream on the beach there is a hot spring which is covered at\r\nhigh tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. THE HOT SPRING OF NAVUNI NEAR FAWN HARBOUR.—This small spring is\r\nsituated in a hilly district in a region where olivine-basalts prevail.\r\nI was indebted to Mr. Pickering for showing me its locality. It lies\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile inland and about 100 feet above the sea.\r\nIt issues from the volcanic agglomerate a few paces from the right bank\r\nof the Navuni stream and five or six feet above its level. In May, 1898,\r\nit had a temperature of 112-113° Fahr.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   GENERAL REMARKS ON THE HOT SPRINGS\r\n\r\nThis island is therefore remarkable for the number of its hot springs.\r\nIn the list given on page 40 I have enumerated 23 localities where they\r\noccur; but, as shown below, their number will probably in time be\r\nextensively increased.\r\n\r\nOn referring to the map it will be observed that the distribution of\r\nthese springs is fairly general over two-thirds or three-fourths of the\r\nisland. Taking this area at about 1,500 square miles and dividing it\r\ninto squares with sides of eight miles, we should, if the springs were\r\nquite evenly dispersed, find a thermal system in every square. Even\r\namongst the Fijians and among the white residents the number of hot\r\nsprings will cause surprise. Only those of Savu-savu, Wainunu,\r\nNukumbolo, Mbatini-kama, and Na Kama on the Wailevu river have been up\r\nto this time generally known. The reason of this is that most of them\r\nare insignificant, and with a temperature far below the boiling-point,\r\nand ooze up in unlikely and out-of-the way places, as by the water-side\r\nin little visited river-valleys, on the reef-flats of not much\r\nfrequented coasts, and in swampy situations where they are likely to be\r\noverlooked. The natives only recognise as “Na Kama” the boiling or very\r\nhot springs; and it was only after much questioning that I could get\r\nthem to tell me of some unimportant “wai katakata” (hot water) which\r\nthey deemed to be far beneath my notice. The natives were keenly\r\ninterested in my botanical and geological investigations; but they\r\nconsidered it to be beneath the dignity of a man who had seen the\r\nwonders of Na Savu-savu to spend some time looking for a half-forgotten\r\nthermal spring in a swamp. From this cause alone I no doubt failed to\r\nfind several springs. All the boiling springs and those of very high\r\ntemperature are probably known; but as is pointed out below it is more\r\nthan likely that a large number of unimportant springs remain to be\r\ndiscovered in many a deserted inland valley and between the tide-marks\r\nalong the very extensive reef-bound coasts.\r\n\r\nAs above remarked the hot springs did not come under my notice in all\r\nparts of the island. They are to all appearance wanting in the western\r\nor Mbua portion, and also in the Undu portion north of Natewa Bay.\r\nTaking the first-named region, it will be noticed that no hot springs\r\nare indicated in the map west of the Ndreketi and Wainunu rivers. I made\r\ninquiries wherever I went, but with no result. On my writing to Mr.\r\nWittstock, of Mbaulailai, who is well acquainted with the Mbua\r\npeninsula, he informed me that if hot springs existed in that part of\r\nthe island he would probably have known of them. In that portion of the\r\nisland which ends in Undu Point I could neither discover nor hear of any\r\nthermal springs east of Lambasa on the north side, and of Lakemba on the\r\nsouth or Natewa Bay side; nor could Mr. Bulling, who has resided at Undu\r\nPoint for many years, tell me of any springs in his neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOn looking at the general map it will be observed that the hot springs\r\nare confined to the area of basic rocks, although they do not occur all\r\nover that area, not being indicated in the map to the west of the\r\nNdreketi and Wainunu rivers. They are not known to occur in the region\r\nof dacites and acid andesites, as in the case of the Drandramea\r\ndistrict; and they have not been found in the area of rhyolitic and\r\ntrachytic rocks that extends from Undu Point to Mbuthai-sau on the north\r\ncoast and to near Tawaki on the Natewa Bay side. The region of hot\r\nsprings would be limited on the east by a line joining the Mbati-ni-kama\r\nsprings with those of Nandongo on the Wainikoro river and Natuvo on the\r\nnorth shore of Natewa Bay. Such a line, though lying within it, roughly\r\nindicates the limit between the regions of basic and acid rocks.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the hot springs in the lower levels, and their\r\nnon-discovery at elevations exceeding 300 feet above the sea, are facts\r\nof importance. In more than half the cases they arise close to and often\r\non the banks of streams and rivers, occasionally indeed at the\r\nriver-bottom; and no doubt numerous unknown thermal springs issue under\r\nwater from the river beds. In about a third of the known cases the\r\nsprings come up on the coast between the tide-marks, usually rising\r\nthrough the reef-flat. At times even they are to be observed below the\r\nlow tide level; and one can scarcely doubt that there are a large number\r\nof undiscovered springs that are never exposed at the lowest tides. It\r\nis also very likely that a number of hot springs issuing between the\r\ntide-marks are still to be discovered without much difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of inland hot springs. Looking at the insignificant\r\ncharacter of many of them and noting their occurrence in places where\r\nthey might easily be overlooked, it is highly probable, as before\r\nremarked, that a number of springs exist inland, which, though once\r\nknown to the natives, are now forgotten. The interior of the island is\r\nvery sparsely inhabited now; but there is evidence of a much more\r\npopulous condition in old times. The present natives are fast losing the\r\nknowledge of the interior of the island which their forefathers\r\npossessed; and many tracts in the mountain districts are far removed\r\nfrom existing paths. From the haphazard manner in which I lighted upon\r\nthermal springs beside the head-waters of the Ndreketi, Wailevu, and\r\nWai-ni-koro rivers, I cannot doubt that many more exist in similar\r\nlocalities not visited by me.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the distribution of the springs as respecting\r\ntemperature, I cannot find any marked arrangement either in their\r\ngrouping or in the amount of elevation. It is noticeable, however, that\r\nthe three systems of hottest springs, that of Savu-savu (210°), that of\r\nNa Kama on the Wailevu river (204°), and that of Tambia (180°) are all\r\nless than 100 feet above the sea. Although the springs of highest\r\ntemperature are confined generally, with the exception of those of\r\nSavu-savu, to the main mass of the island, it would seem that adjacent\r\nsystems of springs may differ much in temperature. The springs of\r\nVunimoli, for instance, have a maximum temperature of 155°, which is\r\nnearly 50° lower than that of Na Kama, three miles to the westward. Hot\r\nsprings are more numerous in the region around Lambasa than in most\r\nother districts. Lastly, I may add that earthquakes are apparently more\r\nfrequent in the Mbua district, where no thermal springs are known, than\r\nin any other part of the island.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the deposits formed around the springs, it may be\r\nobserved that the circumstances are not usually suitable for their\r\nformation, as for instance when they rise through the reef-flat or in\r\nswampy localities. In those springs, however, where the temperature is\r\nover 150° F., and where the water spreads over a surface so as to\r\nfacilitate evaporation, deposits of white sinter associated with algæ\r\noccur, as at Savu-savu, Tambia, and Nukumbolo. Its composition varies a\r\nlittle in different localities. At Savu-savu it is compact and laminated\r\nand formed almost entirely of hydrated amorphous or colloid silica. At\r\nMbati-ni-kama the siliceous sinter is more friable, with a tendency to\r\nform opal. The sinter of the Nukumbolo springs resembles that of\r\nSavu-savu; but it also contains a good proportion of carbonate of lime\r\n(20 per cent.) in a granular form, and that of Tambia has the same\r\ncharacters. It is not unlikely that this lime is derived from the\r\ndecayed shells, such as I have referred to in the case of the Tambia\r\nsprings.... It may be here observed that Mr. Weed and others, who have\r\nstudied the origin of siliceous sinter in the Yellowstone region and\r\nelsewhere, regard it as the secretion of algæ, mosses, &c., that grow in\r\nhot waters (_American Journal of Science_, vol. 37, 1889).\r\n\r\nI come now to some general considerations respecting the hot springs of\r\nVanua Levu. In the first place there is the singular fact that the\r\ninland hot springs nearly always make their appearance along the present\r\nlines of surface-drainage. But I do not gather that the hot springs are\r\nof more recent origin than the rivers and streams, by the side of which\r\nthey rise. On the contrary the hot springs are probably far older. The\r\nconditions of subterranean drainage that favour the formation of springs\r\nat the surface, whether cold or thermal, would no doubt often determine\r\nthe direction of surface drainage in a newly-formed land. Those familiar\r\nwith modern volcanoes will recall the absence or rarity of streams and\r\nrivers, and the frequency often of cold and thermal springs at and near\r\nthe coast, which are sometimes of such bulk at the exits that the\r\nexpression “subterranean river” would be nearly appropriate. The\r\npresence of artesian reservoirs may also in some localities be safely\r\nassumed. I will here draw a little on my own experience of volcanic\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nOn the lava-bound coasts of the riverless southern portion of the large\r\nvolcanic island of Hawaii, the subterranean waters issue as cold and\r\nthermal springs at numerous localities. At Punaluu, and at Ninoli, a\r\nmile to the westward, there are extensive freshwater springs at and near\r\nthe beach which have a temperature of 64° F. all through the year,[31]\r\nthose at Ninoli issuing as a large subterranean stream. East of Punaluu\r\nand at intervals along the Puna coast, springs of water, sometimes fresh\r\nand cold with a temperature occasionally as low as 64°, at other times\r\nmineral and thermal, but with a temperature not usually above 95°, issue\r\nat the surface or at the bottom of deep fissures in the old lava\r\nflows.... In Oahu, another island of the Hawaiian group, where the\r\nvolcanic forces have been long extinct, artesian wells have been in\r\nextensive use for some years in the irrigation of the sugar-cane\r\nplantations. The last water-bearing strata are reached at depths of 400\r\nto 500 feet.[32] The subterranean or artesian reservoirs are evidently\r\ntherefore on a large scale; yet Oahu is scarcely one-third the size of\r\nVanua Levu in Fiji.... Lastly, I will refer to the numerous subterranean\r\nstreams that issue forth, as cold and thermal springs, from beneath the\r\nlavas near and at the Etna coast, as for instance in the vicinity of\r\nAcireale. The Etna slopes are in great part deforested, and in\r\nconsequence soakage is relatively small, and after heavy rains much of\r\nthe water runs off in the torrents. Whilst in this locality I was\r\nimpressed with these facts, and I formed the opinion that in ancient\r\ntimes when Etna was well wooded the discharge of subterranean streams at\r\nthe coast was far greater than at present.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons and on other grounds, amongst them notably the absence\r\nof recent crateral cavities, I infer that the numerous hot springs are\r\nthe outflows of subterranean streams, fed originally by the “soakage”\r\narising from a rainfall of at least 200 to 300 inches in the mountainous\r\nportions of the island. Such subterranean streams run probably at\r\nconsiderable depths, emerging, it is likely, as often under the sea as\r\nthey do on the land.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above I have read in the Journal of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society (November 1902), an abstract of a lecture by Prof.\r\nSuess on the subject of hot springs and volcanic phenomena. Thermal\r\nsprings, he holds, are supplied by hypogene waters and do not receive\r\ntheir salts from the sea. Such springs, according to this view, being\r\nthe survivals of volcanic activity, originate in the depths of the\r\nearth’s crust and bring water to the surface for the first time, not\r\nderiving it from infiltration. It seems almost impertinent to suggest a\r\nview opposed to that of such a high authority; but it appears to me that\r\nthe frequent situation of the Vanua Levu thermal springs along the lines\r\nof surface-drainage requires an explanation that does not altogether\r\nexclude the agency of infiltration.\r\n\r\n\r\n            LIST OF THE HOT SPRINGS OF VANUA LEVU, 1898-99.\r\n\r\n ---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------+--------\r\n Locality.| Coast or | Height   |Near or   |Siliceous |Nature   |Tempera-\r\n          |  inland. |  above   |far from  |  sinter. |of the   |ture.\r\n          |          |sea-level.|streams.  |          |surface  |\r\n          |          |          |          |          |at the   |\r\n          |          |          |          |          |exit.    |\r\n ---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------+--------\r\n 1.

In one place it is 180° F., and in most of the other\r\nsprings it ranges between 100° and 150°.\r\n\r\n(7) Siliceous sinter is formed where the temperature is over 150°.\r\n\r\n(8) As exemplified by the water of the Savu-savu springs the proportion\r\nof salts in solution (8 per 1000) is constant over many years; whilst in\r\nthis fact and in the relative amounts of each salt there is a sharp\r\ndistinction from the composition of sea-water.\r\n\r\n(9) The hot springs are older than the streams and rivers, along which\r\nthey are so frequently found.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that they are largely supplied from the “soakage” of the\r\nheavy rainfall in the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES OF VANUA LEVU.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN this chapter the detailed description of the island is commenced,\r\nbeginning with the western extremity and proceeding eastward. Most of\r\nthe petrological details are dealt with under their respective sections;\r\nbut it has been found necessary also to frequently refer to them in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nTHE NAIVAKA PENINSULA.—This mountainous peninsula forms the conspicuous\r\nfeature of the western extremity of Vanua Levu. Amongst all the\r\nmountains of the island its appearance from a distance gave most promise\r\nof displaying the products of recent volcanic eruptions; but as shown\r\nbelow it affords evidence of an antiquity nearly as great as that of the\r\nrest of the island, although there are reasons for believing that its\r\neruptions took place during the last stage of the emergence.\r\n\r\nNaivaka is connected with the adjacent relatively little elevated part\r\nof the main island by a low and narrow neck a little less than a mile in\r\nbreadth. In its highest part, where it is only raised between 20 and 30\r\nfeet above the sea, this isthmus is formed of the basic volcanic rocks\r\nof the district; but about three fourths of its width are occupied by\r\nmangrove-swamps which are especially extensive on the south side.\r\n\r\nViewed from some miles to the eastward the mountain has a regular\r\nconical outline; but from the south, when seen from Ruku-ruku Bay, it\r\nhas an elongated and a much more irregular profile, descending rapidly\r\non the east side, but displaying a gradual and a fairly regular slope of\r\nabout 10 degrees on the west side. The upper part of the mountain is in\r\nthe form of a curve with the concavity facing south, the crest being\r\nmore or less broken up into five or six peaks showing often precipitous\r\nand at times vertical rocky faces having a drop of from 100 to 300 feet,\r\nthe highest peaks ranging from 1500 to 1658 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nAll around the mountain, except on the upper steep portion on the south\r\nside where it is well-wooded, the slopes have the usual character of the\r\n“talasinga” districts, being occupied only by grass, ferns, cycads, and\r\nthe ordinary scanty vegetation of such regions. Whilst on most sides the\r\nsurface configuration is fairly regular and the ascent to the summit is\r\nmore or less regular, on the south side bold spurs with valleys between\r\nthem descend to the coast, and the central mass rises abruptly in the\r\nmiddle of the peninsula from a height between 300 and 500 feet above the\r\nsea. It is on this side that Naivaka has the appearance of having been\r\noriginally a crateral mountain, of which, however, only the north\r\nsegment in a much degraded condition now remains, whilst the other\r\ntwo-thirds have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing rocks are a blackish compact olivine-basalt, having as a\r\nrule much smoky glass in the ground-mass and possessing a specific\r\ngravity of 2·92-2·94. They are referred to in the description of genus\r\n25 of the olivine-basalts given on page 259.\r\n\r\nThese rocks compose the agglomerate and the agglomerate-tuffs that form\r\nthe eastern portion of the summit and probably most of the elevated part\r\nof the mountain. Similar agglomerates occur along most of the north\r\ncoast, the rock being in a few places scoriaceous or amygdaloidal; and\r\nthey occur in huge fallen masses on the south side near the foot of the\r\nprecipitous portion. The blocks in the agglomerate of the summit are\r\nusually six to eight inches across.\r\n\r\nOn the south-west side the massive rocks exposed are less basic with a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·76 to 2·79. They are also more altered, the\r\nolivine being infrequent and the interstitial glass scanty. They differ\r\nbesides in the parallel arrangement and in the length of the\r\nfelspar-lathes (·18 mm.), which are on the average half as long again as\r\nthose of the prevailing olivine basalts (·12 mm.). They are placed in a\r\ndifferent order of these rocks and belong to genus 37 described on page\r\n262.\r\n\r\nTuffs did not come frequently under my notice. At one part of the north\r\ncoast the cliffs are formed of a palagonitic tuff-sandstone,\r\neffervescing with an acid, which is described on page 330. Although no\r\norganic remains are to be noticed, it is probably a submarine deposit.\r\n\r\nOn a spur on the south-west side, at an elevation of 600 feet, there is\r\nexposed a hard red palagonitic tuff dipping away from the summit at an\r\nangle of 40°. It is mainly composed of the palagonitised _débris_ of a\r\nvacuolar basic glass and incloses broken and entire crystals of\r\nplagioclase, augite, and olivine.\r\n\r\nThe augite crystals, which attain a length of five or six mm., project\r\nfrom the weathered surface and are easily detached, lying about in\r\nquantities on the ground in places. Although they are now imbedded in\r\nevidently a submarine tuff, these pyroxene crystals could only have been\r\nejected as such from a subaerial vent; and it would therefore appear\r\nthat they fell into the sea around the shores of a volcanic island in a\r\nstate of activity. These crystals are often cracked and are as a rule\r\nnot so perfect as those I have gathered from the slopes of Vesuvius,\r\nStromboli, and Etna. They exhibit an unusual tabular form arising from\r\nthe great development of the clinopinakoid at the expense of the\r\northopinakoid faces.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it may be inferred that the Naivaka volcano was submerged\r\nat the time of its origin, but that the eruptions continued after it\r\nbegan to show itself above the sea. In many of its features, especially\r\nin the character of the agglomerate that forms its upper portion, and in\r\nthe palagonitic nature of the tuffs, Naivaka differs only from other\r\nelevated districts of the island, where organic remains occur, in the\r\nabsence of such remains. Its form bears testimony to the extreme\r\ndegradation we find in other districts, and the occurrence of\r\nforaminiferous tuffs high up the neighbouring slopes of Mount Sesaleka\r\naffords additional evidence of the original submergence of this\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nTHE HILL OF KOROLEVU.[33]—About three miles east of Mount Naivaka there\r\nrises to a height of 800 feet, about a mile inland from the shores of\r\nWailea Bay, the singular flat-topped hill of Korolevu. It displays\r\nvertical cliff-faces, with a drop often of 200 or 300 feet, which have\r\nbecome so deeply furrowed or fluted by the eroding atmospheric agencies\r\nthat they appear at a distance to be made of columnar basalt. The hill\r\nis, however, formed in mass of a compacted tuff or agglomerate tuff\r\nbuilt up of materials of a hyalomelan basic glass that has undergone\r\npartial conversion into palagonite. In the upper thirds these rocks show\r\nno bedding, but in the lower slopes on the seaward side they are bedded\r\nand dip to the north away from the summit at an angle of 15° or 20°. The\r\nform of this hill is well shown in the sketch attached, and there is\r\nlittle doubt that we have here an old volcanic “neck,” the remains of a\r\nsubmarine vent.\r\n\r\nA specimen of the tuff from the summit is made up of compacted\r\nfragments, in size ranging up to one third of an inch, of a bottle-green\r\nvacuolar glass, which fuses readily in a lamp-flame and is not dissolved\r\nby hydrochloric acid. This glass is usually isotropic, but much of it is\r\nalso palagonitic and feebly refractive, the vacuoles or steam-holes,\r\nwhich are often elongated, being in the last case filled with the same\r\npalagonitic material. Plagioclase crystals occur macroscopically in the\r\nglass; they are much eroded and contain numerous large inclusions both\r\nof the clear isotropic glass and of its palagonitised form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Korolevu Hill (800 ft.) from Wailea Bay.]\r\n\r\nAbout a third of a mile west of the Korolevu hill rises the hill of\r\nNgangaturuturu, 450 feet high, which presents a precipitous cliff-faced\r\nsummit in which are exposed basic tuffs showing pyroxene crystals\r\nprojecting from the weathered surface.\r\n\r\nTHE BOMB FORMATION OF NAVINGIRI.—A mile north-west of Korolevu Hill,\r\nwhere the coast road crosses a spur at the back of Navingiri, a very\r\ncurious formation is exposed at an elevation somewhat under 200 feet\r\nabove the sea. Here there are to appearance a number of large more or\r\nless spherical volcanic bombs, two to three feet across and formed of a\r\nsemi-vitreous scoriaceous basalt, imbedded in a hyalomelan-tuff\r\ndisplaying the same microscopical characters as in the case of the tuff\r\nforming the adjacent hill of Korolevu.\r\n\r\nThe ash is light grey in colour and rather friable; but where in contact\r\nwith the bombs it becomes darker and is hardened. The steam pores of the\r\nbombs are round and not elongated; and as is usual with these bodies\r\nthey increase in size from the outside, where they are very small (1\r\nmillimetre and less), to the centre, where they vary from two to five\r\nmillimetres across. A vitreous border, about an inch in breadth, forms\r\nthe outer shell of the bomb where it is in contact with the tuff. Some\r\nof the bombs are only two or three inches apart; and one of them shows\r\nevidence of fracture, fragments of the outer vitreous shell lying\r\nimbedded in disorder in the surrounding tuff.\r\n\r\nBefore entering into more detail it may be at once observed that the\r\ncontiguity of some of the bombs to each other makes it at first\r\ndifficult to view them as having been formed in the manner volcanic\r\nbombs are supposed to originate. Those who have seen the huge bombs\r\nlying scattered about on the summit of Vulcano in the Lipari Islands\r\nwill appreciate the difficulty of imagining how these bombs can occur in\r\nsuch a close arrangement without having often shattered each other to\r\nfragments. However, Mr. Wittstock of Mbaulailai in a letter to me\r\ndescribes even larger bombs that came under his notice exposed on the\r\nsurface in the Mbua district, their outer crust when broken looking\r\n“like the slag of a blast-furnace.”\r\n\r\nThe bomb-rock is a semi-vitreous basaltic andesite. It displays\r\nmicroporphyritic plagioclase in a ground-mass formed mainly of a smoky,\r\nalmost isotropic glass, in which numbers of felspar microliths (·1 mm.)\r\nare developed, the augite being but slightly differentiated. Scattered\r\nabout in the glass are little irregular patches, or “lakelets,” of\r\nresidual magma composed of a yellowish feebly refractive material that I\r\ncannot distinguish from palagonite.\r\n\r\nThe ash, in which the bombs are imbedded, is a somewhat friable\r\nhyalomelan-tuff composed of fragments of basic glass often partially\r\npalagonitised, and usually 2 or 3 mm. in size. In it occur pumiceous\r\nlapilli of the same material up to 2 centimetres in diameter. The glass\r\nis markedly vacuolar, the cavities being either filled with gas or with\r\nalteration-products. The vacuoles are often drawn out into tubes, giving\r\nthe glass a fibrillar appearance. The numerous plagioclase phenocrysts\r\ninclosed in the glass are much honeycombed and contain large inclosures\r\nof the glass, both altered and unchanged.\r\n\r\nAlthough the line of contact is well defined in a hand-specimen, the two\r\nrocks cannot be separated along the junction. In a thin section, in\r\nwhich the union of the vitreous shell of the bomb with the ash is well\r\nshown, there is no defined line of demarcation, the non-vacuolar\r\nisotropic glass of the bomb being there broken up into fragments, with\r\nthe interspaces filled with the partially palagonitised pumiceous ash.\r\nIn the vitreous shell the felspar microliths are much less developed\r\nboth in size and number than in the central portion of the bomb.\r\nNumerous cracks communicating with the round steam-pores, which are much\r\nlarger than the vacuoles of the ash-glass, are filled with the same\r\nyellowish magma-exudation referred to in the case of the rock forming\r\nthe centre of the bomb. Through the cracks this palagonite-material has\r\nfound its way into the steam-pores.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the above that the bombs were but partially\r\nconsolidated when they fell into the bed of ash. The tuff is somewhat\r\n“baked” where it is in contact with the bombs; and there is evidence of\r\na collision between the bombs in the fragments of the vitreous shell\r\nimbedded in the ash. Although the ash itself contains no organic\r\nremains, there occur, not many hundred yards away and at an elevation\r\n100 feet higher above the sea, foraminiferous tuffs of basic glass which\r\nare described below. There is no indication of a crateral cavity in this\r\nlocality; whilst the ancient “neck” represented by Korolevu Hill is a\r\nmile away. These bombs most probably after being ejected from some\r\nsub-aerial vent fell into the sea around, on the floor of which much\r\nbasic pumice-ash had been previously deposited. Such masses as they sank\r\nwould lose most of their original momentum.\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE SECTION NEAR KOROLEVU HILL.—Between the hills of Korolevu and\r\nNganga-turuturu, at an elevation of about 300 feet above the sea, there\r\nis a singular exposure of tuffs horizontally stratified and forming a\r\nlow escarpment or line of cliff about 15 feet high on the hill-side.\r\nThese beds display the passage from basic tuffs below to relatively acid\r\ntuffs above, and they establish that in this locality the period of acid\r\nandesites followed that marked by the eruption of basalts and basaltic\r\nandesites. From their horizontal and undisturbed position, it may be\r\ninferred that these deposits began to be formed under the sea when the\r\nactivity of the submarine basic vents was on the wane. In their\r\ncomposition and in the various degrees of coarseness of their materials,\r\nwe can plainly discern the history of volcanic action in this locality.\r\n\r\nA hard compacted palagonite-tuff makes up the lower half of the\r\nthickness of beds exposed, 15 feet in all. The greater portion of it has\r\nthe uniform texture of a sedimentary rock, fine-grained below where the\r\nfragments are ·1 to ·3 mm. in size, and becoming coarser above where the\r\nlarger measure 1 to 2 mm. It is composed of more or less angular\r\nfragments of a basic vacuolar isotropic glass, and of plagioclase and\r\naugite with much fine palagonitic _débris_. There is no effervescence\r\nwith an acid; but in the upper part there are a few casts of\r\nforaminifera of the “globigerina” type, as indicated in the thin\r\nsections. Above this lies a bed of a similar basic tuff, having however\r\na banded appearance from the arrangement of materials of different\r\ndegrees of coarseness, the finer being ·1-·2 mm. in size, the coarser\r\n·4-·8 mm. There is little or no carbonate of lime; but occasional tests\r\nof foraminifera of the type above mentioned occur in the slide. The\r\nbasic tuffs here abruptly terminate. They represent the quiet deposition\r\nin water comparatively deep of the products of marine erosion, and of\r\nthe finer ejectamenta of some distant subaerial vent.\r\n\r\nAbove the basic tuffs lie a series of tuffs, about 5 feet in thickness,\r\nand composed mainly of the debris of acid andesitic rocks of the\r\nhornblende-andesite type, such as occur in the Ndrandramea district.\r\nThey mark a period of active eruption on the part of some neighbouring\r\nacid andesitic vent in this neighbourhood, which the subsequent explorer\r\nmay be able to identify with some volcanic “neck.”\r\n\r\nThese tuffs are composed partly of fragments of a hemicrystalline\r\nhornblende-andesite and partly of crystals, broken and entire, of\r\nplagioclase, hornblende, rhombic pyroxene, and augite. The plagioclase\r\nis tabular, zoned, and glassy, and gives extinctions of\r\noligoclase-andesine (6 to 12°). The hornblende is bottle green, markedly\r\npleochroic, and gives extinctions up to 14°. The rhombic pyroxene has\r\nthe characters described on page 301, in the case of the Ndrandramea\r\nrocks. The augite is less frequent, but the two pyroxenes are sometimes\r\nassociated as intergrowths.\r\n\r\nThese acid tuffs do not effervesce with an acid, nor can any tests of\r\nforaminifera be observed in them; but since these organisms are\r\nrepresented in the basic tuffs below, it is highly probable that the\r\nwhole series of these horizontal beds is submarine. The first or lowest\r\nbed of the acid tuffs indicates a somewhat violent volcanic outbreak in\r\nthis neighbourhood, following the deposition of the basic tuffs. It is\r\ncomposed of loosely compacted subangular fragments, 1 to 3 millimetres\r\nin size, in which the macroscopic prisms of the rhombic pyroxene are\r\nespecially frequent. It passes upward without interruption into a\r\nregularly grained sandstone formed of rounded and subangular fragments\r\nmeasuring ·3 to ·7 mm. across. Above this lies a quite distinct bed, a\r\nfew inches thick, of a fine compact clay rock, where the mineral\r\nfragments measure only ·05 to ·12 mm. in diameter, hornblende being well\r\nrepresented, although the rhombic pyroxene is very scanty. Up to this\r\ntime these beds of acid tuffs indicate a gradual defervescence of the\r\nvolcanic activity that began with some violence, as shown by the\r\ncharacters of the lowest bed. Now another outbreak occurred, and\r\noverlying the clay-like bed we find a coarse tuff made up of fragments 2\r\nto 5 millimetres across, and approaching in texture and appearance a\r\nsubaerial tuff, but in other respects similar to those below it. It is\r\nthe last and uppermost of this series of acid tuffs, and with it\r\nterminates an interesting record of the past in this region, the chief\r\nfeatures of which may thus be summarised.\r\n\r\nA prolonged period of quiet deposition of submarine basic tuffs, the\r\nproducts partly of marine erosion and partly of distant eruptions, was\r\nabruptly followed by the outbreak of a neighbouring vent during which\r\ntuffs formed of the debris of acid andesites were deposited. The gradual\r\ndecrease in the degree of activity is plainly shown in the gradual\r\ndiminution in size of these tuffs, until they acquire the fineness of a\r\nclay. Then another burst of activity from the same vent or vents\r\noccurred, and the record ends. Since that time there has been apparently\r\nan upheaval to an elevation of 300 feet above the sea. As, however, the\r\nbeds are quite undisturbed, the emergence may have been due to the\r\nlowering of the sea-level, a subject which is discussed in Chapter\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\nCOAST BETWEEN WAILEA BAY AND LEKUTU.—The hills here often approach the\r\ncoast, their spurs running down to the beach. In the low range, 250 to\r\n300 feet high, east of Wailea Bay, are exposed palagonite-tuffs dipping\r\ngently north-east and composed of fragments of a vacuolar basic glass,\r\nmore or less palagonitised, and of minerals (plagioclase, etc.) not\r\nexceeding 2 mm. in size. These deposits are apparently non-calcareous\r\nand show no organic remains.\r\n\r\nFarther along the coast towards Nativi basic tuffs and agglomerates\r\nappear at the surface; but the underlying rock, exposed in position in\r\nthe stream-courses and prevailing along much of the sea-border to Nativi\r\nand a mile or so beyond, is a vesicular semi-ophitic basaltic andesite\r\nwith coarse doleritic texture and containing much interstitial smoky\r\nglass. (It belongs to the non-porphyritic group of genus 9 of the\r\naugite-andesites described on page 273.) Such rocks evidently represent\r\nancient flows. They give place as one proceeds east to porphyritic\r\nsemi-ophitic doleritic rocks of the same genus and to semi-vitreous\r\nbasic rocks. About half a mile west of Nukunase a vesicular doleritic\r\nbasaltic andesite forms a spur protruding at the coast. It is\r\nsemi-ophitic and contains in the smoky glass of the groundmass little\r\nirregular cavities filled with a yellowish residual magma like\r\npalagonite in character. (It is referable to genus 12 of the\r\naugite-andesites, described on page 275.) A few paces west of this spur\r\na vertical dyke, 20 feet wide and trending N.W. and S.E., appears on the\r\nbeach. It is formed of a bluish scoriaceous basaltic andesite containing\r\nmuch glass in the groundmass and showing imperfectly developed felspar\r\nlathes. It is included in genus 4 of the augite-andesites described on\r\npage 270.\r\n\r\nA little east of the spur there is another dyke apparently vertical and\r\nformed of a vesicular rather than a scoriaceous basaltic andesite\r\nreferred to genus 1 of the augite-andesites (page 267). It differs from\r\nthe rock of the previous dyke in the presence of small plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts which contain abundant magma-inclusions; but it resembles it\r\nin the characters of the groundmass. This dyke is about 40 feet in\r\nthickness and trends N.E. and S.W.\r\n\r\nIt may be inferred from the foregoing remarks that there was at one time\r\na volcanic vent in the district west of Nukunase. The lines representing\r\nthe trend of the two dykes above noticed would if extended meet at a\r\ncommon focus a little way inland. The rocks of the dykes differ\r\nconspicuously from the prevailing doleritic rocks that form, as before\r\nremarked, the ancient flows, the average length of the felspar-lathes in\r\nthe former being ·1-·2 mm., in the latter ·3-·4 mm. Both, however,\r\nbelong probably to the same vent of which now the exact situation would\r\nnot be easy to discover, on account of the re-shaping of the surface\r\nthrough the denuding agencies.\r\n\r\nMOUNT KOROMA.—The highest peak of the hills lying inland between Wailea\r\nBay and Lekutu is named Koroma and attains a height of 1,384 feet. I did\r\nnot ascend its slopes higher than 900 feet, and approached it from the\r\nMbua or south side. Extensive plains, covered with the usual “talasinga”\r\nvegetation, reach inland from the shores of Mbua Bay to the foot of this\r\nrange without attaining a greater elevation than 100 feet. This low\r\ndistrict is drained by the Mbua river and its tributaries, the rock\r\nusually exposed at its surface being a decomposing porphyritic basaltic\r\nandesite. It is again referred to on page 56 in connection with the\r\nlow-lying level region of this portion of the island of which it in fact\r\nforms a part.\r\n\r\nA basic non-calcareous fine-grained tuff-sandstone is exposed in a\r\nstream at the foot of the south slope of Mount Koroma. Whilst crossing\r\nsome low wooded outlying hills in this locality, I came suddenly upon\r\nwhat seemed like a desert in miniature, quite bare of vegetation and\r\noccupying an area of some acres. Here a porphyritic basic rock, from\r\nsome cause unknown to me, has decomposed in the mass to a depth of 20\r\nfeet and more; and the result is a surface of white crumbling rock\r\nscored deeply by the rains and carved out by the denuding forces into\r\nminiature hills and dales. It is not improbable that a small crater in\r\nits last solfatara-stage once existed here; but the whitened\r\ndisintegrated rocks alone remain, and we can now only hazard a\r\nconjecture as to the cause.\r\n\r\nI found a variety of basic rocks exposed on the hill slopes up to 900\r\nfeet. The most frequent of the deeper-seated rocks which occurred in\r\nmass at this elevation, and as large blocks on the lower levels, is a\r\ndark grey rather altered hypersthene-augite-andesite, referred to genus\r\n1 of that sub-class as described on page 286. The specific gravity is\r\n2·73, whilst the groundmass displays a little greenish altered glass.\r\nAnother of the deeper rocks, exposed 500 feet up the slopes, is placed\r\nin the same sub-class, augite and rhombic pyroxene being porphyritically\r\ndeveloped, separately and as intergrowths. The groundmass displays short\r\nstout felspars, augite, and a little altered glass. The rock is\r\ntherefore referred to the orthophyric order described on page 290. Spec.\r\ngrav. 2·78.\r\n\r\nEvidence of more recent surface lava-flows here exists. In one place I\r\ncame upon such a bed 12 feet thick, compact in its upper half and slaggy\r\nor scoriaceous in its lower half. The rock is an aphanitic\r\naugite-andesite (spec. grav. 2·77) and belongs to species B, genus 16,\r\nof the augite-andesites, as described on page 281. Its groundmass\r\ndisplays felspar-lathes in flow-arrangement with a little interstitial\r\nglass. Slaggy lava is not uncommon on these slopes. One specimen beside\r\nme is a semi-vitreous form of the deeper hypersthene-augite-andesites of\r\nthis range.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be better evidence of sub-aerial lava-flows on the\r\nlower slopes of Mount Koroma than I found in any other part of the\r\nisland. It should have been before remarked that one of these flows lies\r\nupon a bed of a hard reddish compact tuff, which appears in the thin\r\nsection as an altered palagonite-tuff, containing fragments of minerals\r\nincluding both rhombic and monoclinic pyroxene, but showing neither lime\r\nnor organic remains. The larger fragments are 2 mm. in size. It seems\r\nlikely that this flow ran into the sea during the emergence of this part\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of rocks of the hypersthene-augite-andesite type in Mount\r\nKoroma distinguishes this range from the surrounding regions of\r\nolivine-basalts and basaltic andesites. This district is well worth a\r\ndetailed examination, and perhaps the remains of a crateral cavity may\r\nyet be found.\r\n\r\nTHE COAST BETWEEN NAIVAKA AND KORO-NI-SOLO AT THE FOOT OF THE NORTH\r\nSLOPE OF THE SESALEKA RANGE.—Basaltic andesites, and olivine-basalts of\r\nthe Naivaka type occur on this coast. A rock of more acid character,\r\nlight grey and much altered, is exposed at the surface where the track\r\ncrosses the headland projecting into Ruku-ruku Bay. It is one of the\r\npropylites referred to in my description of the second genus of the\r\naugite-andesites (p. 269). The felspars of the groundmass give the small\r\nextinctions of oligoclase; and in this respect it differs from the other\r\naugite-andesites. Besides the altered plagioclase phenocrysts there is\r\nmuch microporphyritic augite but slightly changed. Calcitic and other\r\nalteration products occur in the interstitial glass.\r\n\r\nMOUNT SESALEKA.—This is the name of the highest peak, 1,370 feet, of a\r\nremarkable ridge-shaped range, which is very precipitous on the east and\r\nnorth-east sides, where there is a sheer drop apparently of 500 or 600\r\nfeet, whilst on the other sides the slope is more gradual, especially on\r\nthe north where there is a gentle descent to the sea. The actual summit\r\nis bare, rocky, and narrow. There is a curious native legend relating to\r\na pond on the top of this hill. From what Mr. Wittstock tells me, it\r\nseems probable that there is a spring near the summit. Close to the top\r\nare the remains of an old “koro-ni-valu” or war-town; whilst numbers of\r\nshells of species of Cardium, Cypræa, and Strombus, such as would be\r\nused for food, lie about. Many years ago there was a prolonged siege of\r\nthis stronghold, which is referred to here as indicating that the\r\ndefenders had some independent water-supply.\r\n\r\nIn ascending from Koro-vatu on the west side basic agglomerates and\r\nagglomerate-tuffs were found exposed as far as half-way up. In the upper\r\nhalf occurred at first fine-grained calcareous tuffs, bedded and dipping\r\ngently down the slope, composed of palagonite-debris, mineral fragments\r\nand calcitic material and displaying a few macroscopic tests of\r\nforaminifera. These tuffs became non-calcareous and coarser as one\r\napproached the summit. A specimen obtained from the top is\r\ncoarse-grained, being composed of fragments of basic glass, usually\r\npalagonitised, much augite, a little plagioclase and fresh olivine, but\r\nno tests of foraminifera, the size of the fragments being usually\r\n·5-1·5 mm. Massive rocks were rarely exposed on this side; but half-way\r\nup in a stream course I came upon an exposure of a porphyritic\r\nolivine-basalt containing a fair amount of devitrified interstitial\r\nglass. Its specific gravity is 2·85 and it is referred to genus 25 of\r\nthe olivine basalts (page 259). I descended by a gentle slope to the\r\nnorth, coarse basic tuffs and agglomerates containing amygdaloidal\r\nfragments being displayed on the surface. In a stream at the foot, close\r\nto Koro-ni-solo, were blocks of a heavy compact olivine-basalt with\r\nspecific gravity 2·96.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT BETWEEN MOUNT SESALEKA, THOMBO-THOMBO POINT, AND VATU-KAROKARO\r\nHILL.—This is a broken country with several abruptly rising lesser\r\nhills. Starting from Koro-vatu and crossing the Thombo-thombo\r\npromontory, I reached the coast of Mbua Bay near Navunievu. Basic tuffs\r\nand agglomerates prevailed on the way, the last containing blocks of a\r\nscoriaceous basaltic lava bearing olivine. The massive rocks exposed\r\nbelong in some cases to genus 13 of the olivine-basalts as described on\r\npage 256, being dark grey and having a specific gravity of 2·88, and in\r\nother cases to genus 16, species B, of the augite-andesites when they\r\nare lighter in colour and have a specific gravity of 2·77. In both cases\r\nthe interstitial glass is scanty.\r\n\r\nI ascended Vatui, one of the numerous small hills of the district. It is\r\n450 feet high and is capped by a bare mass of tuff-agglomerate, 40 to 50\r\nfeet high and containing fragments of vesicular basic lava. This mass is\r\npierced by a dyke, 18 inches thick, which is inclined to the N.NE. at a\r\nhigh angle of 60 or 65 degrees with the horizon. This dyke is composed\r\nof a compact olivine-basalt which is remarkable for the prevalence of\r\nsmall augite prisms in the groundmass. It is described on page 265 under\r\ngenus 44 of the olivine-basalts. Hand-specimens are magnetic and display\r\npolarity, which is due, as pointed out in Chapter XXVI., to the exposed\r\nsituation of the peak.\r\n\r\nVatui in its characters is evidently typical of the other lesser\r\nhills around, which, as viewed from below, possess bare tops and\r\nprecipitous declivities of the same formation. All the hills in the\r\ndistrict including Sesaleka are capped by these basic tuffs and\r\ntuff-agglomerates; and doubtless as in the case of Sesaleka these\r\ndeposits are all submarine. This is true also of Vatu-karokaro, a\r\nhill 600 feet high, overlooking Mbua Bay and about two miles east of\r\nSesaleka. In the lower part of this hill is exposed a dark compact\r\nbasaltic andesite, referred to genus 13, species B, of the\r\naugite-andesites (sp. gr. 2·83), whilst blocks of a black\r\nolivine-basalt (sp. gr. 2·91) occur in the agglomerate of the\r\nsummit. These hills may all be regarded as “volcanic necks” or the\r\nstumps of volcanic cones, probably submarine.\r\n\r\nTHE DIVIDING RIDGE BETWEEN THE MBUA AND LEKUTU PLAINS.—A level rolling\r\n“talasinga” district intervenes between Mbua Bay and the dividing ridge.\r\nThe upper part of this ridge, which attains a height of about 500 feet\r\nabove the sea, is composed of a hard grey sandstone-like tuff,\r\neffervescing feebly with an acid, which on examination proves to be\r\nformed in great part of fragments, ·07-·1 mm. in size, of a dark basic\r\nglass occasionally vacuolar. The rest of the deposit consists of\r\nsimilar-sized fragments of plagioclase and other minerals, and includes\r\nalso a few tests of foraminifera of the “Globigerina” type.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the ridge, however, is composed of coarse tuffs and\r\nagglomerates of a different kind which have been covered over by the\r\nforaminiferous deposit just described. Thus there are exposed on the\r\nlower slopes, tuffs and agglomerates of a basic pitchstone formed of a\r\nbrown glass containing a few felspar and pyroxene microliths. In the\r\ntuff the fragments are three to six mm. in size and show evidence of\r\ncrushing _in situ_, the interstices being filled with debris of the same\r\nmaterial more or less palagonitised,[34] but there is no carbonate of\r\nlime. Large masses of an agglomerate made up of blocks of an acid\r\nandesite occur higher up the slopes. The component rock belongs to an\r\nunusual type of hypersthene-andesite, specially noticed on page 297.\r\n\r\nThe interesting feature in this ridge lies in the testimony it affords\r\nthat the extensive Mbua and Ndama basaltic plains, on which I was unable\r\nto discover any submarine deposits, were at one time submerged.\r\n\r\nTHE MBUA AND NDAMA PLAINS.—These rolling plains are a striking feature\r\nin the western end of Vanua Levu. They have an arid barren look, are\r\nclothed with a scanty and peculiar vegetation, possess a dry crumbling\r\nsoil often deeply stained by iron oxide, are traversed by rivers without\r\ntributaries descending from the wooded uplands of the interior, and in\r\nfact have well earned the name given to them by the natives of\r\n“talasinga” or sun-burnt land. Both Seemann and Horne have remarked on\r\nthe South Australian aspect of these regions, which are characteristic\r\nof the lee and drier sides of the larger islands of the group. Covered\r\nfor the most part with grass, ferns and reeds, these low-lying districts\r\nare dotted here and there with Casuarinas, Pandanus trees and Cycads,\r\nwhilst such other trees and shrubs as Acacia Richii and Dodonæa viscosa,\r\nadd to the variety and peculiarity of the vegetation. The origin of\r\nthese “talasinga” districts is discussed in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe Mbua and Ndama plains form a continuous region extending three to\r\nfive miles inland to the foot of the great mountain of Seatura, to the\r\nwatershed between Mbua and Lekutu, and to the base of Mount Koroma;\r\nwhilst it reaches along the sea border from the vicinity of Navunievu\r\nabout four miles west of the Mbua River to beyond Seatovo a few miles\r\nsouth of the Ndama River. Their extent is defined in a general sense by\r\nthe 300 feet contour line in the map. Their elevation, however, above\r\nthe sea does not generally exceed 200 feet and is usually only 50 or 100\r\nfeet; but at the foot of Seatura they rise to between 300 and 400 feet.\r\nWhilst on the one side these plains form a continuation of the lower\r\nslopes of the great Seatura mountain, on the other side they are\r\nextended under the sea as the broad submarine platform, the edge of\r\nwhich, as defined by the 100-fathom line, lies eight to ten miles off\r\nthe coast. It is pointed out on page 372 that this continuity of\r\nsurface, both _supra_-marine and submarine, extends probably to the\r\ngeological structure and that the submarine platform represents the\r\nextension under the sea of the basaltic flows of the plains.\r\n\r\nThe whole region of the plains is occupied by olivine-basalts and\r\nbasaltic andesites, such as are found on the neighbouring lower slopes\r\nof the Seatura mountain. They are as a rule much decomposed, even at a\r\ndepth of several feet below the surface. Typically, they are neither\r\nvesicular nor scoriaceous, and in this respect they possess the\r\ncharacter of submarine lava-flows. The rolling surface of the plain is\r\nvaried occasionally by small “rises” or hillocks marking apparently some\r\nsecondary cone, of which the much degraded “wreck” alone remains. Here\r\nand there fragments of limonite, approaching hæmatite in its compact\r\ntexture, lie in profusion on the soil, representing doubtless small\r\nswamps long since dried up, some of which still occur in the hollows of\r\nthe plain. Mingled with these fragments are often pieces of siliceous\r\nrocks and concretions, such as are found in the other “talasinga”\r\ndistricts of the island, the description of which is given on pages 128,\r\n132, &c.\r\n\r\nI will now refer more in detail to some of the points alluded to in this\r\nshort description of these plains. With reference first to the compact\r\nlimonite, it should be remarked that it occurs on the surface either as\r\nfragments of hollow nodules two or three inches across, or as portions\r\nof flat “cakes” half to one inch thick. It is especially abundant in the\r\ndistrict lying a mile or two on either side of the Navutua stream-course\r\nbetween Ndama and Mbua. Here the subsoil is charged with ferruginous\r\nmatter, and the water of the series of stagnant pools in the bed of the\r\nstream is stained blood-red by iron-oxide, a circumstance that has\r\nnaturally given rise to native legends of a corresponding hue. These\r\nfragments of iron ore, which lie between 100 and 150 feet above the sea,\r\nrepresent the final stage of a process which is now no doubt in\r\noperation on the bottom of the neighbouring pools and small swamps.\r\nTheir presence on the surface goes to indicate that this open country\r\nhas been for ages a land-surface free from forest, as it is in our own\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, the extensive disintegration of the basaltic rocks\r\nthat form these plains affords evidence of the great antiquity of these\r\n“talasinga” plains in their present unforested condition. The extent to\r\nwhich these rocks have weathered downwards is very remarkable. Between\r\nNdama and Mbua they are decomposed to a depth often of eight or ten feet\r\nbelow the surface. This is well exhibited in the sides of deep channels\r\nexcavated by the torrents during the rains. Here the spheroidal\r\nstructure is well brought out in the disintegrating mass, all stages\r\nbeing displayed in the formation of the boulders that are scattered all\r\nover these plains.\r\n\r\nIn one locality, near the lower course of the Ndama river, a thickness\r\nof 25 feet of decomposed rock was exposed in a cliff-face. In this case\r\nthe rock was a porphyritic basaltic andesite, the disintegrating process\r\nhaving affected the whole thickness of the large spheroidal masses with\r\nthe exception of a hard central nucleus of the size of the fist. In one\r\nof these nuclei by my side it is apparent that during the extension of\r\nthe weathering process the phenocrysts of glassy plagioclase become\r\nopaque long before the groundmass is affected. In this specimen the\r\nstage of disintegration as affecting the felspar phenocrysts is at least\r\none and a half inches in advance of that affecting the groundmass.\r\n\r\nThis great disintegration of the basaltic rocks, which as pointed out on\r\npage 64 is also in progress on the slopes of the adjacent spurs of Mount\r\nSeatura, is more characteristic of the porphyritic basaltic andesites\r\nthan of the olivine-basalts. It is to the spheroidal weathering that we\r\nmust look for an explanation of the rounded boulders so frequent in\r\nthese districts. It may also be inferred that the soil produced from\r\nthis extensive decomposition of the rocks is often very deep. At the\r\nWesleyan Mission Station at Mbua, on level ground nearly a hundred feet\r\nabove the river, a well has been sunk to a depth of 20 feet in soil of\r\nthis description; and away to the westward a similar thickness of soil\r\nproduced by the same cause is in places to be observed.\r\n\r\nComing to the characters of the basaltic rocks of the Mbua and Ndama\r\nplains, it may be remarked that the prevailing rocks are the porphyritic\r\nbasaltic andesites, having a specific gravity of 2·77 to 2·81, which are\r\nin most cases to be referred to genus 13 (porphyritic sub-genus) of the\r\naugite-andesites described on page 278. They possess large phenocrysts\r\nof plagioclase and but little interstitial glass. The other rocks are\r\nolivine-basalts with specific gravity 2·88 to 2·90 and showing only a\r\nfew small plagioclase-phenocrysts. They display a little residual glass\r\nand belong for the most part to genus 37 of the olivine basalts\r\ndescribed on page 262. In both these basaltic rocks the felspar-lathes\r\nare in flow-arrangement; but in the basaltic andesites they average\r\n·11 mm. in length, whilst in the olivine-basalts they average ·18 mm.\r\n\r\nThe low mound-like “rises” in these plains, to which previous reference\r\nhas been made, are not usually elevated more than 50 feet above the\r\ngeneral surface. One of these hillocks that lies near the track from\r\nMbua to Navunievu, about two miles from the Wesleyan Station, is\r\ncomposed of a remarkable semi-vitreous pyroxene-andesite passing upward\r\ninto a rubbly rock of the same nature. The rock of this old volcanic\r\nneck is of an unusual type and is referred to the prismatic order of the\r\nhypersthene-augite andesites described on page 289. Both the felspar and\r\npyroxene prisms of the groundmass are in flow-arrangement. One of these\r\nmounds near the Mbua Wesleyan Station is apparently formed of the\r\ndecomposing basaltic andesite of the district. On its surface are\r\nfragments of earthy limonite and siliceous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe rarity of submarine tuffs and clays on these plains is somewhat\r\nsingular; but in the occurrence of foraminiferous tuffs high up the\r\nslopes of Sesaleka and on the crest of the Mbua-Lekutu dividing ridge we\r\nhave evidence of the original submergence of all these lower regions. It\r\nis probable enough that the ages of exposure that have since witnessed\r\nthe reduction of the solid basaltic rock to a crumbling mass several\r\nfeet in depth were more than sufficient for the stripping off of most of\r\nthe overlying submarine deposits. Such deposits are, however, common on\r\nthe surface of the extensive “talasinga” plains that constitute much of\r\nthe north side of the island.\r\n\r\nTHE SHELL-BED OF THE MBUA RIVER.—Rather curious evidence of an emergence\r\nof a few feet and of a considerable advance of the delta of the Mbua\r\nriver in comparatively recent times is afforded by a bed of marine\r\nshells exposed in the right bank of this river, about 200 yards below\r\nthe boat-shed of the Wesleyan Mission Station and about two miles in a\r\nstraight line from the sea. This bed, which is about a foot in\r\nthickness, is exposed for a distance of 70 or 80 yards. It slopes\r\ngradually seaward as one descends the river, being raised two or two and\r\na half feet at its upper end above the river level at low tide, whilst\r\nat its lower end it is at about the water-level. The river-bank is here\r\n15 or 16 feet high, and is composed in its upper half of a fine gravel\r\nof volcanic rocks mixed with earth, which below passes abruptly into a\r\nfriable non-calcareous black mud-rock (not bedded and looking like\r\nconsolidated swamp mud), in which the layer of shells is contained.\r\nThese shells are, therefore, covered by deposits, 13 or 14 feet in\r\nthickness, of which the upper eight feet are formed of gravel and earth,\r\nand the rest of mud-rock. They are evidently gathered together on the\r\nslope of an old mud-flat.\r\n\r\nThe shells are all large marine bivalves, belonging to the genera\r\nOstræa, Meleagrina, Cardium, Arca, &c., no freshwater shells occurring.\r\nThey are often much decayed and have lost the ligaments. The valves are\r\ngenerally separate; but in some cases they are still in apposition, the\r\ncavity being then filled with the same black mud in which the shells are\r\nembedded. They lie about in all positions, some vertical, some\r\nhorizontal, and are often piled on each other. In some cases large\r\nborers have perforated one or both of the valves; and here and there\r\nvalves may be noticed with smaller oyster-shells attached to the inner\r\nsurface. No vegetable remains were discovered with the exception of a\r\nsingle “stone” of the fruit of the Sea tree,[35] which is common in\r\nthese islands, its empty almost indestructible stones occurring\r\nfrequently in the drift stranded at the mouths of rivers.\r\n\r\nAt first sight one would look to human agency for the explanation of\r\nthis shell-bed; but many of its features are inconsistent with such a\r\nview. If the shells had been originally collected by the aborigines for\r\nfood, the absence of those of marine univalves of the genera Turbo,\r\nStrombus, Cypræa, &c., such as are much appreciated as food by natives,\r\nis inexplicable. The extent of the bed and its uniform thickness are\r\ncharacters that give no support to such an explanation. It represents,\r\nas I apprehend, an ancient shell-bank formed on a muddy bottom in\r\ncomparatively shallow water near the mouth of a river. Since that time\r\nthe Mbua River has cut through its old deposits, and the margin of its\r\ndelta is now two miles to seaward, the intervening new land being formed\r\nof extensive mangrove-swamps in its lower part, whilst nearer the\r\nshell-bed there is much level land raised a few feet above the sea, on\r\nwhich the native town and different villages now stand. The amount of\r\nemergence here indicated since the time when this bank of shells was\r\nforming under the sea does not probably exceed a couple of fathoms.\r\n\r\nLEKUMBI POINT.—This singular long and low promontory is between three\r\nand three-and-a-half miles in length and rather less than a mile in\r\naverage width. It is monopolised by mangroves, except at the extremity\r\nwhere the swampy ground passes into the dry sandy soil occupied by the\r\ncharacteristic vegetation of coral beaches. This terminal portion, which\r\nis about a third of a mile in length and raised a couple of feet above\r\nhigh-water mark, was originally a reef-islet. The outer third of the\r\ncape, however, is cut off from the remainder by a narrow winding passage\r\nin the mangroves, which being 25 or 30 feet wide can be traversed by\r\nboats at and near high-water, and is often used to shorten the journey\r\ndown the coast. The flowing tide rushes in at both entrances, and when\r\nthe tide is ebbing it finds its way out at both exits, the passage\r\npresenting the readiest way of the filling and emptying of the interior\r\nswamps with the flow and ebb of the tide.\r\n\r\nBefore explaining the origin of this low tongue-shaped promontory of\r\nLekumbi, it should be observed that it lies on a long projecting patch\r\nof coral reef which is continuous with the neighbouring shore-reefs.\r\nDepths of seven and eight fathoms are found off the sides and of 11 and\r\n12 fathoms off the end of the reef-patch. This reef in its turn must\r\nhave been built up on a submarine bank protruding from the coast. Such a\r\nbank may have originally been produced by the deposits brought down by\r\nthe Ndama River which finds an exit through the mangroves near the base\r\nof the cape. With the exception, however, of the Lekutu River, none of\r\nthe other Vanua Levu rivers have given rise to such tongues of land at\r\ntheir mouths. I am more inclined to hold that the submarine shoal, which\r\nunderlies the present low cape of Lekumbi, indicates an old lava-flow\r\nfrom the great crateral valley of Seatura, opposite the mouth of which\r\nit lies. Traces of such flows are still to be found in that locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEATURA MOUNTAIN.—In my description of the profile of this part of\r\nVanua Levu, reference has already been made (p. 3) to the great mass of\r\nthis mountain which occupies five-sixths of the breadth of the island.\r\nViewed from seaward it looks like a huge table-topped mountain-ridge,\r\nand as such it is represented in the Admiralty charts; but when its true\r\ncontours are distinguished it appears, when defined by the 300-feet\r\nlevel in the map, as a somewhat rounded mass, measuring 12 miles in\r\nlength and 10 miles in breadth and attaining a maximum height of 2,812\r\nfeet. Seen from the deck of a passing ship it displays more or less\r\nregular volcanic slopes, especially on the east, where there is a\r\ngradual descent at an angle of 3 or 4 degrees for some 10 miles, and on\r\nthe north towards the Lekutu lowlands. It also shows a fairly regular\r\ndescent towards Mbua Bay on the west. (See profile, p. 62.)\r\n\r\nOn the west side, however, there is a great gap in the mountain-mass\r\n(the Ndriti Gap), marking, as I hold, an old crateral cavity of large\r\ndimensions, and now occupied by the Ndama River and its tributaries.\r\n\r\nThe adjacent Seatovo Range to the southward obscures the profile of the\r\nmountain on the south; and it is in fact not at all easy for this reason\r\nto get a view with all the slopes displayed. It is only at times, when\r\nviewed in its complete mass with uninterrupted outlines, as from off the\r\nmouth of the Ndreketi River to the north-east, or when the symmetry of\r\nits long eastern slope is observed from Wainunu Bay that Seatura\r\ndisplays itself as a gentle-sloped mountain-mass of the Mauna Loa type.\r\nDense forest clothes the greater part of it, except on the north and\r\nnorth-west, where it lies within the limits of the scantily vegetated\r\n“talasinga” region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profile and Geological Section of the western end of\r\nVanua Levu from the Wainunu estuary across the summit of the basaltic\r\nmountain of Seatura to the edge of the submarine platform off the Ndama\r\ncoast as limited by the 100-fathom line.]\r\n\r\nThe slopes of this mountain are deeply furrowed by river-valleys which\r\nradiate like the spokes of a wheel from its central elevated mass. Down\r\nits northern slopes flow the Lekutu River and its tributaries and the\r\nprincipal tributaries of the Sarawanga River. The large western\r\naffluents of the Wainunu River descend from its eastern side, whilst the\r\nKorolevu, Tongalevu, and other small rivers flow south into Wainunu Bay,\r\nand the Ndama River drains its western slopes. In all these cases,\r\nexcepting that of the Ndama River, the rivers have worn deep valleys\r\ninto the mountain-mass, valleys of denudation that represent the work of\r\nages. That of the Lekutu is a deep cut almost into the heart of the\r\nmountain; at Nandroro in this valley, which lies 6 to 7 miles inland and\r\n800 feet above the sea, the hills rise steeply on either side of the\r\nriver to an elevation of 1,100 and 1,200 feet and more. Some of the\r\nlarge tributaries of the Sarawanga and the Wainunu flow through\r\ngorge-like valleys 200 to 300 feet in depth. On the western slopes north\r\nof the Ndama river, the mountain-side presents an alternating series of\r\nlofty spurs and deep broad valleys. In fact, all around Seatura its\r\nslopes are deeply furrowed through the denudation and erosion of ages.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of this ancient volcanic mountain are almost all of the\r\nmassive basic type, and except at the mouth of the Ndriti Gap hardly\r\never display a scoriaceous character. It is also noteworthy that no\r\ndetrital rock, whether agglomerate, tuff, or tuff-clay came under my\r\nobservation. The rocks exposed on the surface are mostly blackish brown\r\nolivine-basalts and porphyritic basaltic andesites, the former much\r\nprevailing. In the northern portion, however, grey olivine basalts of a\r\ndifferent type occur. In the great crateral hollow, which I have named\r\nthe Ndriti Gap, are displayed numerous dykes formed of highly altered\r\nbasaltic rocks that may be classed among the propylites.\r\n\r\nThe dense forest that clothes the greater part of this mountain offers\r\nmany serious hindrances to geological exploration. Except in the\r\nnorthern portion, views of the surroundings are very limited, and one\r\nhas often to rely mainly on the aneroid and the compass to obtain\r\ncorrect ideas of the contours and general configuration. During most of\r\nthe time spent in the southern part of the mountain, my work was greatly\r\nimpeded by heavy rains, and from this cause and from the frequent\r\nnecessity of following up the stream-courses and of crossing rivers in\r\nflood, I was usually wet through all the day.\r\n\r\n_(a) The Eastern Slopes of Seatura._—The basaltic flows, of which this\r\nmountain is principally composed, are best observed on the eastern side\r\nwhere the original volcanic slopes are preserved. Although the rivers\r\nhave worn such deep valleys into the mountain sides, it is however not\r\noften that any great exposure of rock occurs, on account of the dense\r\nforest-growth over much of this region. It is only occasionally that the\r\ncolumnar structure of these old basaltic flows is displayed. It is\r\nespecially well exhibited in the face of a waterfall, distant about two\r\nmiles in a straight line from Tembenindio and elevated about 700 feet\r\nabove the sea. Here there is an exposure to the extent of 25 feet of\r\nhuge basaltic vertical columns, four to five feet across, and pentagonal\r\nin form. The rock is a blackish basalt with scanty olivine and a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·87. It is referred to genus 25 of the\r\nolivine-basalts which is described on page 259. Micro-phenocrysts of\r\nplagioclase and a few of augite occur, the olivine being mostly replaced\r\nby pseudomorphs. The felspar-lathes of the groundmass average ·18 mm. in\r\nlength, and there is a little brown opaque interstitial glass. Boulders\r\nand fragments of a closely similar basalt, with a specific gravity of\r\n2·9, lie about on the surface in this region. The Seatura slopes here\r\nabut on the plateau of Na Savu, formed largely of volcanic agglomerates,\r\nto be subsequently described.\r\n\r\nOn the south-eastern slopes of the mountain between Ndawathumi (inland)\r\nand Korolevu (at the coast), somewhat similar basalts with scanty\r\nolivine are exposed (sp. gr. 2·86-2·91). Some of them show the\r\nfelspar-lathes of the groundmass arranged in a plexus (genus 25), whilst\r\nothers exhibit flow-structure (genus 37), the average length of the\r\nlathes varying in different localities between ·15 and ·21 mm. All\r\ndisplay scanty residual glass. On the shores of Wainunu Bay between the\r\nWainunu and Korolevu rivers occur porphyritic basaltic andesites with a\r\nconsiderable amount of glass in the groundmass. There is exposed on the\r\nright side of the mouth of the last-named river a highly basic variety\r\nof olivine-basalt with a specific gravity of 3·07. It is referred to\r\ngenus 15 (described on page 258), which includes the most basic rocks in\r\nmy collection. There are in this rock no plagioclase phenocrysts and the\r\nfelspar-lathes of the groundmass are relatively infrequent, whilst\r\nolivine and augite occur in abundance. There is little or no residual\r\nglass. In the district of Tongalevu blackish olivine-basalts and\r\nbasaltic andesites of the usual character are found. In the Na Suva\r\nrange, which lies two miles inland from the shores of Nasawana Bay and\r\nforms the southerly extension of the mountain, a somewhat compact\r\nvariety of olivine-basalt (sp. gr. 2·92) prevails up to the summit,\r\n1,550 feet above the sea. It is included in genus 37 of the\r\nolivine-basalts. In the length of the felspar-lathes (·15 mm.) it\r\nbelongs to the Seatura type of these dark basalts.\r\n\r\n_(b) The Western Slopes of Seatura._—Here overlooking the plains north\r\nof the Ndama River the same olivine-basalts and porphyritic basaltic\r\nandesites occur. The vegetation is of the scanty “talasinga” character,\r\nand since there is little or no soil-cap the disintegration of the rocks\r\nhas been very great, often extending to a depth of 10 or 12 feet. It is\r\nremarkable that this disintegration is most marked in the “talasinga”\r\nand similar scantily wooded districts of the mountain. On the densely\r\nwooded eastern and southern sides where there is a thick soil-cap, it is\r\nby no means so evident. Here on the western slopes have been carved out\r\ndeep broad valleys and lofty spurs, the last in their turn furrowed on\r\ntheir flanks, without any apparent sufficient cause. The shallow streams\r\nat the bottom of the valleys appear quite incompetent to produce such\r\ngreat erosion; and doubtless these results are partly due to the action\r\non the crumbling rock-surface of temporary torrents formed during the\r\nrains.\r\n\r\n_(c) The Northern Slopes of Seatura._—Here within the scantily vegetated\r\n“talasinga” region the conformation of the land is well displayed.\r\nBroad, deep and nearly parallel valleys, separated by level-topped spurs\r\nand occupied by the Lekutu and its tributaries, score the mountain’s\r\nslopes. The prevailing rocks are blackish-brown olivine-basalts and\r\nporphyritic basaltic andesites, such as occur around the other parts of\r\nSeatura; but grey olivine-basalts also occur, possessing opaque\r\nplagioclase-phenocrysts and looking like porphyrites. They are\r\nessentially holocrystalline and are probably more deeply situated than\r\nthe other basaltic rocks. They are referred to genera 26 and 38\r\ndescribed on pages 261, 263, and have a specific gravity of 2·75-2·83.\r\nDark doleritic basalts distinct from all the others are exposed in\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nA good idea of this region may be obtained by following the road\r\nwestward from Tavua on the head-waters of the Sarawanga River to Wailevu\r\non the westernmost tributary of the Lekutu River, a distance of about 6\r\nmiles. Leaving Tavua one at once begins to ascend and cross the long\r\nspur that descends from Seatura and divides the valleys of these two\r\nriver-systems. On its slopes are exposed much decomposed blackish\r\nbasalts possessing scanty olivine and showing large porphyritic crystals\r\nof plagioclase. They have a specific gravity of 2·84 and are assigned to\r\nthe porphyritic sub-genus of genus 25 (page 259). At the summit, 800\r\nfeet above the sea, occur blocks of a grey holocrystalline basalt with\r\nscanty olivine and semi-opaque plagioclase-phenocrysts referred to genus\r\n26 and having a specific gravity of 2·76. It appears to form the axis of\r\nthe spur. Descending to the main Lekutu River, just below Kavula, where\r\nthe elevation is about 300 feet above the sea, one observes exposed in\r\nmass in the river-bed a dark semi-ophitic doleritic basalt similar to\r\nthe doleritic rocks without olivine prevailing on the coast between\r\nWailea Bay and Lekutu (see page 50), but differing in the absence of\r\nfelspar-phenocrysts. It displays a considerable amount of opaque\r\ninterstitial glass and is assigned to genus 12 of the augite-andesites\r\n(page 275). The specific gravity is 2·78, but there are a few minute\r\nirregular cavities in its substance.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Kavula one crosses another of the Seatura spurs at a level of\r\n650 feet, descending then into a smaller river-valley occupied by a\r\ntributary of the Lekutu, on the banks of which lies the village of\r\nNawai, 350 feet above the sea. Then another spur is crossed at an\r\nelevation of 450 feet and the descent is made into the valley of the\r\nWailevu tributary of the Lekutu. Crossing the valley, which at the town\r\nof Wailevu is elevated 300 feet, one rises to a height of 700 feet and\r\nthen descends into the Mbua plains. These three almost parallel valleys\r\nof the Lekutu and its two tributaries are worthy of a detailed\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe rocks on the surface between Kavula and Wailevu vary in character.\r\nNearer Kavula there appears a blackish compact olivine-basalt (spec.\r\ngrav. 2·88), showing a little microporphyritic plagioclase and\r\nbelonging to genus 37 of the olivine rocks. Further on is exposed one\r\nof the holocrystalline grey olivine-basalts with porphyritic\r\nplagioclase-phenocrysts and specific gravity 2·83. It belongs to the\r\ntype described in genus 38 of the rocks on page 263. Nearer Wailevu\r\nthere occurs a blackish porphyritic basalt with scanty olivine and\r\nspecific gravity 2·81. It contains but little residual glass and is\r\nreferred to the porphyritic sub-genus of genus 25. In some cliffs at\r\nthe river-side close to Wailevu, there is displayed a semi-vitreous\r\nbasaltic andesite, showing large porphyritic plagioclase crystals, 3\r\nto 8 mm. Its low specific gravity (2·68) is to be attributed to the\r\nlarge amount of glass in the groundmass. There is a loose mesh-work of\r\nfelspar-lathes, but the augite is not differentiated. Westward of\r\nWailevu commence the decomposing basaltic rocks of the Mbua plains.\r\n\r\n_(d) Traverse of the Northern Part of the Summit of Seatura from Kavula\r\nSouth-West to Narawai._—The track first lay up the picturesque valley of\r\nthe Lekutu River to Nandroro, 2½ miles distant and 800 feet above the\r\nsea. On the way blackish basaltic rocks of the prevailing Seatura type,\r\nwith or without scanty olivine, were displayed often in a decomposing\r\ncondition. At one place a characteristic grey olivine-basalt, showing\r\nopaque porphyritic plagioclase (sp. gr. 2·87), and looking like a\r\nporphyrite, was exposed. On account of the abundance of the olivine, it\r\nis placed in genus 2 of the olivine-rocks. After Nandroro the path lay\r\nup the steep mountain-side to a height of 1,500 feet: and afterwards\r\nacross the summit of the northern part of Seatura, which is here about\r\ntwo miles in breadth. This elevated region is well wooded with here and\r\nthere a patch of “talasinga” land; but it is by no means level, its\r\nelevation varying between 1,400 and 1,800 feet, and it soon became\r\nevident that we were crossing the heads of valleys, sometimes 200 or 300\r\nfeet in depth, that could only have been excavated by the torrential\r\nrains. These streamless valleys afford another indication of the\r\ndenudation to which this ancient mountain has been subjected.\r\n\r\nThe rocks prevailing in this elevated northern portion of Seatura, at\r\nheights of 1,500 to 1,800 feet above the sea, are: (_a_) blackish\r\nbasalts with scanty olivine, a little interstitial glass, and belonging\r\nto the porphyritic and non-porphyritic sub-genera of genus 25 of the\r\nolivine-rocks: (_b_) grey olivine-basalts with porphyritic opaque\r\nplagioclase, containing but little residual glass, but varying greatly\r\nin the amount of olivine and belonging to the genera 2 and 26 of the\r\nolivine-basalts; they would be classed, as far as appearance goes, as\r\nporphyrites; their specific gravity ranges 2·85 to 2·90. The rock\r\nexposures were, however, scanty; and but little information could be\r\nobtained of the mode of occurrence. No scoriaceous rocks were found\r\nexcept in the instance of a compact dark basalt without plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, apparently a dyke rock, and belonging to genus 40 of the\r\nolivine-basalts.\r\n\r\n_(e) Ascent to the Summit of Seatura from Ndriti._—The town of Ndriti\r\nlies in the great gap in the south-west side of the mountain which has\r\nbeen previously mentioned as probably an old crateral cavity. After\r\ntraversing a district of highly altered basic rocks or propylites, to be\r\nsubsequently described, and reaching an elevation of about 400 feet\r\nabove the sea, I came to the long slope that leads up to the summit. A\r\ndense forest hid everything from view, so that the compass and aneroid\r\nhad alone to be relied on.\r\n\r\nAt first one traversed a series of step-like alternations of level\r\nground and steep “rises,” until the old site of the village of Seatura,\r\nabout 1,200 feet above the sea, was reached. There are some strange\r\nlegends connected with this old mountain-village, which is now only\r\nindicated by little piles of stones and the debris of a wall, and was\r\nevidently abandoned long ago. We finally reached the summit by following\r\nup a spur or ridge in a northerly direction from Seatura. There was a\r\nprecipitous descent on either side of the ridge with evidently a broad,\r\ndeep valley to the eastward. The summit was rounded; but on account of\r\nthe forest no view could be obtained. There was never any extensive\r\nexposure of rock noticed during the ascent; but all the way up\r\noccasional small blocks of a blackish olivine-basalt were observed on\r\nthe surface, of the same general type as that found all around the\r\nmountain and referred to genus 37 in the synopsis.\r\n\r\n_(f) The Ndriti Basin or Gap._—This great hollow in the side of Seatura,\r\nwhich I have named after the town in its midst, is apparently a crateral\r\ncavity now drained by the Ndama river, and its tributaries, and covered\r\nwith dense forest to such a degree that a general view of the whole is\r\nimpracticable. The glimpses, however, that one obtains of the mountain\r\nscenery are very grand, the town of Ndriti lying in the midst of\r\nmountains that rise almost on all sides of it except on the west. This\r\ngreat cavity is contracted at its mouth a little below the town and\r\nexpands in its interior, where it must be two or three miles in width.\r\nIts floor is fairly level and is elevated only about 200 feet above the\r\nsea;[36] whilst its mountainous sides rise to 2,000 feet and over.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the map there are two breaks in the outline of this ancient\r\ncrater, the one on the west through which the Ndama river flows, the\r\nother on the south where the dividing ridge, separating it from the\r\nNandi Valley is under 700 feet in elevation. The Nandi Gorge, as I will\r\nterm the last-named, is a narrow picturesque ravine leading through the\r\nmountains from Nandi to Ndriti. One follows up a rocky stream-course\r\nhemmed in by precipitous sides until the top of the gorge is reached,\r\nwhen the watershed is crossed, and the descent is then made to Ndriti by\r\none of the tributary stream-courses of the Ndama river.\r\n\r\nTwo or three large rapid streams, after draining its mountainous slopes,\r\nunite within the basin to form the Ndama river, which, as it issues from\r\nits mouth, becomes a comparatively placid stream rolling sluggishly\r\nalong to the sea, some five or six miles away, with an average drop of\r\nabout thirty feet in a mile. In the course of ages the original\r\nconfiguration of this great hollow has doubtless been extensively\r\nmodified by the denuding agencies. The rainfall on the mountain-slopes\r\nmust be very great, probably not under 250 inches in the year[37]; and\r\nNdriti, though only 200 feet above the sea, is in all probability on\r\naccount of its situation one of the wettest places in the island. The\r\nrivers have evidently been important factors in reshaping the original\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nNearly all the rocks exposed _in situ_ in the beds of the rivers and\r\nstreams in the floor of the great Ndriti basin, and for 300 or 400 feet\r\nup its sides are more or less highly altered basic rocks, to which the\r\nold and the new names of greenstone and propylite may be fitly applied.\r\nThey often sparkle with pyrites, and not uncommonly effervesce with an\r\nacid, so that one is apt to imagine one’s self in a region of limestone.\r\nThe degree of alteration varies considerably, those most altered being\r\nlight-coloured and greenish, whilst the others are darker, the specific\r\ngravity ranging from 2·69 to 2·79. In spite of these differences almost\r\nall of them appear to belong to the same eruptive series, being as a\r\nrule sharply distinguished from the prevailing unaltered surface\r\nbasaltic rocks of the slopes of Seatura by the size of the felspars of\r\nthe groundmass, which average about ·3 mm. in length, whilst those of\r\nthe basaltic rocks just alluded to average only ·17 or ·18 mm. long.\r\nThese rocks are also well displayed in the sides of the Nandi Gorge; and\r\nfrom their mode of exposure by river-erosion, as well as from their\r\nrelatively coarse crystalline texture, and from their alteration, it may\r\nbe inferred that they are older and more deeply situated than any of the\r\nSeatura rocks before referred to. Whether these rocks, which extend over\r\nan area of some square miles, have been altered by solfataric action or\r\ncontact-metamorphism,[38] I will not now say. The fact remains, however,\r\nthat they are best exposed wherever the streams have worn deeply into\r\nthe floor, and lower slopes of the great basin, or have cut down into\r\nthe mountain-mass as in the case of the Nandi Gorge. The rocks that lie\r\nin loose blocks on the surface either at the bottom of the basin or on\r\nits slopes extending even to the very summit of the mountain (see page\r\n67), are characteristic blackish olivine-basalts of the type prevailing\r\naround the mountain’s slopes. These propylites are most frequently\r\nexposed as dykes in the beds of the rivers at the bottom of the basin.\r\nSuch dykes vary from 4 to 6 feet in thickness, and they are very\r\nconspicuous when they stretch across the river’s breadth projecting more\r\nor less above the water. From their frequency it may be inferred that in\r\nmany other small exposures, ill suited for displaying the mode of\r\noccurrence of the rock, we have also to deal with dykes. Judging from\r\nfour dykes that were particularly examined, they are all vertical or\r\nnearly so, and all run in much the same direction, namely, N.N.W.—S.S.E.\r\nor N.W.—S.E., whether on the north or south side of the great basin. In\r\none instance, a rudely columnar structure across the thickness of the\r\ndyke was observed. From their exposure in river-beds it was rarely\r\npossible to ascertain much more than is given above. However, in the bed\r\nof a river, a mile above Ndriti, there was an extensive exposure of a\r\nhighly altered greenish rock which was crossed by a vertical dyke, 4\r\nfeet thick, formed of a dark grey less altered rock. I have referred\r\nthese two propylites to two different genera of the augite-andesites,\r\nthe dyke-rock to genus 2, and the other to genus 4. In the case of the\r\ndyke the rock is a little vesicular; whilst in the other it is densely\r\ncharged with pyrites. Both have been subjected to the same alteration;\r\nbut in a different degree; and it would thus seem that solfataric\r\ninfluences were here in operation before and after the intrusion of the\r\ndyke.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the characters of the alteration of these rocks of the\r\nNdriti basin, it may be remarked that where the change is greatest the\r\nfelspars of the groundmass are alone recognisable. The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts are quite disguised by alteration products, and chlorite,\r\nviridite, epidote, calcite, pyrites, &c., occupy much of the groundmass.\r\nOther rocks are less affected and in a few the change is only slight.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the prevailing types of the propylites of the Ndriti\r\nBasin, it has already been observed that in most of them the\r\nfelspar-lathes of the groundmass are unusually large, the average\r\nlength being ·3 mm. From the rare occurrence of olivine in some of\r\nthe rocks that are but slightly changed, it is to be inferred that\r\nmost of them belong to the augite-andesites, and might be termed\r\ndoleritic basaltic andesites. But in other respects they differ\r\nconsiderably, both as regards the presence or absence of\r\nflow-arrangement of the felspar-lathes, and in the occurrence and\r\nsize of the plagioclase-phenocrysts, some having large porphyritic\r\ncrystals, others small phenocrysts, and others none at all. Many of\r\nthem contained a little interstitial glass. In my classification of\r\nthe augite-andesites they are assigned to genera 2, 4, 16, &c., and\r\nadditional particulars concerning their characters are given in the\r\ndescription of those genera. Judging from the average large size of\r\nthe felspar-lathes it may be held that, although in other features\r\nthey often differ, some of the general conditions under which they\r\nwere produced were the same.\r\n\r\nOn the right bank of the Ndama river, opposite Ndriti, there is a\r\nsingular association of a vertical dyke of a bluish-grey basic andesite\r\nwith a reddish scoriaceous lava, apparently a flow. The dyke is about 4\r\nfeet thick and runs N.W. and S.E., like the other dykes of the basin,\r\nexhibiting also a rudely columnar structure across its breadth. Where\r\nthe two rocks are in contact, the dyke has a vitreous border half an\r\ninch thick, and an offshoot of the dyke, four inches wide, has\r\npenetrated the lava, acquiring at the same time a more glassy texture.\r\nThe small size of the felspar-lathes of both rocks distinguishes them\r\nfrom the dyke rocks of the basin, where the felspars are twice as long.\r\nBoth rocks show some degree of alteration.[39]\r\n\r\nIn following the valley of the Ndama River from Ndriti to Telana, about\r\nthree miles farther down, one traverses a picturesque region. Emerging\r\nfrom the great basin the river flows through the rolling plains of the\r\n“talasinga” district. Near Ndriti, and occasionally on the way to\r\nTelana, is exposed a scoriaceous grey basaltic rock; and between two and\r\nthree miles below Ndriti there is to be observed in the river-bed\r\nevidence of a comparatively recent flow of a highly basic scoriaceous\r\nlava from the ancient crater of the Ndriti basin. The rock, which is\r\ndark and fresh-looking, shows large porphyritic crystals of augite and\r\nolivine but no plagioclase, whilst the groundmass contains a little\r\nbrown interstitial glass. Its characters will be found described under\r\ngenus 3 of the olivine-basalts (p. 255). Its specific gravity,\r\nnotwithstanding its large empty steam-pores, is 2·91. It differs\r\nmarkedly from the basaltic rocks of the Seatura slopes and the Mbua and\r\nNdama plains, in the great porphyritic development of augite and\r\nolivine, in the large size of the felspars and augite of the groundmass,\r\nand in its numerous steam-holes. But in the coarseness of its small\r\nfelspars it belongs to the same type as the altered or propylitic basic\r\nrocks of the Ndriti basin. It is probably by some such lava flow from\r\nthe old Ndriti crater that the submarine bank was formed off the\r\nadjacent coast on which the low Lekumbi promontory has been built up.\r\n\r\nIn the numerous dykes of the Ndriti basin and in the great alteration\r\nwhich their rocks have frequently undergone, we have evidence in support\r\nof the view that this is an old crateral cavity, an opinion that is\r\nsupported by the indications of lava-flows that have issued, apparently\r\nin later times, from the mouth of the basin. Reference has already been\r\nmade to the locality where a dyke-rock and the rock-mass, into which it\r\nhas been intruded, are both propylitic; and from this and other facts,\r\nsuch as the varying degrees of alteration in different parts of the\r\nbasin, it is to be inferred that in the last stage of the activity of\r\nthis vent its bottom and sides were extensively affected by solfataric\r\ninfluences. Since that period, the configuration of the crater-basin has\r\nbeen greatly modified through the denuding agencies.\r\n\r\nThe absence, or at least the great rarity, of tuffs and agglomerates in\r\nthe case of Seatura is remarkable. The mountain has evidently been built\r\nup in the mass by flows of basic lava; and from this source have no\r\ndoubt in an important degree been derived the basaltic flows of the\r\nNdama, Mbua, and Sarawanga plains, great streams of basalt that further\r\nseaward have helped to form the submarine platform extending several\r\nmiles from the coast. The submarine tuffs and agglomerates that occur at\r\nvarious elevations, reaching as high as 1,200 feet above the sea, in the\r\nSesaleka, Lekutu, Sarawanga, and Ndrandramea districts lying to the\r\nnorth-west, north, and east, did not come under my notice on the Seatura\r\nslopes. On the other hand, except in the few localities, where\r\nscoriaceous rocks occur, the general type of the basalts is such as we\r\nwould expect to find in submarine flows. In no part of the island,\r\nhowever, is the antiquity of the land-surface so well attested by the\r\ndisintegration of the basaltic flows, which extends here to depths of\r\nten and even twenty feet. This is in favour not only of the sufficiency\r\nof time, but also of the ability of the denuding agencies to strip off\r\nthe surface-deposits.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it is evident that the mountain of Seatura\r\npossesses a history quite independent of that of the rest of the island.\r\nI have pointed out in Chapter I. that it represents a mountain of the\r\nTahitian type. In its radiating valleys and in its basaltic character it\r\nmuch resembles the mountainous island of Tahiti, which Dana describes as\r\na gently sloping cone of the Hawaiian order that through the erosion of\r\nages has become a dissected mountain.[40]\r\n\r\nTHE SEATOVO RANGE.—This remarkably situated mountain-range, which I have\r\nnamed after a town at the foot of its western slope, extends from the\r\nvalley of the Ndama River to Solevu Bay. It attains a maximum height of\r\nabout 1,800 feet, and varies between this elevation and 1,500 feet until\r\nin the vicinity of Solevu, where it descends as a mountainous headland\r\nto the coast. Its summit is narrow and ridge-shaped, and although the\r\nwhole range is not interrupted by gaps it has a composite origin. At its\r\nnorth end, where it is cut off from the Seatura Range by the Nandi Gorge\r\nit helps to close in the large Ndriti basin. Towards the south an\r\noffshoot proceeds eastward and shuts in Solevu Bay. But, although\r\napparently all the rocks are basic, considerable variety prevails, and\r\nthere are many puzzling points in the geological structure of this\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nAt the place where this range abuts on the Ndama valley, below Ndriti,\r\nthe grey scoriaceous basalt, before referred to, is exposed at its foot.\r\nHowever, the usual blackish basaltic rocks, often carrying a little\r\nolivine, form in mass the mountainous southern headland that culminates\r\nin Solevu Peak (Ulu-i-matua); and the same rocks prevail in the lower\r\nregions on the west side of the range from Vuia Point to the valley of\r\nthe Ndama River. The southern portion will be described in the account\r\nof Solevu Bay; and I will now give the results of my journey across the\r\nsummit of the range about half a mile south of the Leading Peak of the\r\nchart.\r\n\r\nThe eastern slopes are steep and often precipitous, whilst on the\r\nwestern side there is a more or less gentle descent to the lower levels,\r\nsuggestive of a volcanic slope; and it is remarkable that whilst the\r\nrocks exposed on the precipitous eastern side for the lower two-thirds\r\nare sometimes markedly altered, on the western side they are\r\ncomparatively unchanged. These facts at once suggest that we have here\r\nthe western rim of a large crateral cavity, though the topography of\r\nthis district is not sufficiently well shown in the chart to enable one\r\nto define its original limits. This inference is also supported by the\r\noccasional scoriaceous character of the rocks below referred to.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent rocks in the upper two-thirds of the range are grey\r\nporphyritic olivine-basalts, displaying opaque plagioclase phenocrysts\r\nand more or less hematised olivine, the specific gravity being about\r\n2·9. They approach in characters the grey porphyritic olivine-basalts of\r\nthe northern part of Seatura (pages 65, 66); but differ amongst other\r\nfeatures in the greater abundance of the olivine and in exhibiting\r\nflow-structure. They are usually almost holocrystalline, and are\r\nassigned for the most part to genus 14 of the olivine-basalts. They are\r\nextensively exposed in the stream-courses on the west side between 500\r\nand 900 feet; and huge masses of the same rocks, but containing less\r\nolivine and more glass, and displaying much calcite, viridite, and other\r\nalteration products, are found near the base of the eastern slopes. The\r\nsemi-vitreous condition of these rocks is represented in the large\r\nmasses of a dark very scoriaceous porphyritic lava, possessing quite a\r\ncindery appearance, that occur on the narrow ridge-shaped summit. The\r\ngroundmass shows a few scattered felspar microliths; but it is in the\r\nmain composed of a dark opaque glass. Small cube-like crystals of\r\nchabazite line some of the cavities.\r\n\r\nOther basic rocks are not infrequent and apparently represent dykes.\r\nThus on the eastern side at 800 feet is exposed a dark-grey semi-ophitic\r\ndoleritic rock (sp. gr. 2·77) assigned to genus 12 of the\r\naugite-andesites (page 275). The felspar-lathes average ·3 mm. in\r\nlength, and there is a little interstitial glass containing viriditic\r\nand calcitic alteration products, the same materials filling small\r\nrounded vesicular cavities. On the same slope between 1,000 and 1,200\r\nfeet, there are displayed fresh-looking compact non-porphyritic basaltic\r\nandesites (sp. gr. 2·84), where the felspar-lathes average ·2 mm. and\r\nthe interstitial glass is scanty. They are referred to genus 16, species\r\nC, of the augite-andesites. On this side also between 600 and 800 feet\r\noccur blocks of a highly altered slightly vesicular augite-andesite\r\nshowing a little microporphyritic plagioclase. It is assigned to genus\r\n13, species B, of the augite-andesites. In one place where it is in\r\nposition it is scoriaceous, the steam-holes being round, empty and one\r\nto five mm. in size. In the less glassy rock it displays numerous small\r\nirregular cavities either filled with fibrous viridite or calcite or\r\nshowing concentric zones of the two minerals. The felspar-lathes are\r\n·15-·2 mm. in length. In blocks near the foot of the eastern slope occur\r\na blackish olivine-basalt (sp. gr. 2·88) of the prevailing Seatura type,\r\npossessing a little interstitial glass and felspar-lathes with an\r\naverage length of ·2 mm. It belongs to genus 25 of the olivine-rocks....\r\nOn the western slopes at a height of 500 feet occurs a dark compact rock\r\n(sp. gr. 2·89) with abundant olivine which is referred to genus 1 of the\r\nolivine basalts. There is a little residual glass, the felspar-lathes\r\naveraging only ·08 mm. in length. A similar-looking rock is exposed at\r\n1,400 feet, which displays felspar-lathes averaging ·2 mm. long (sp. gr.\r\n2·9). It belongs to genus 37 of the same olivine class. Here also is\r\nassigned an aphanitic basalt, with a few scattered large plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts and felspar-lathes averaging ·15 mm. long, which is\r\ndisplayed near the base of the slope.\r\n\r\nI could not satisfy myself as to the presence of tuffs on the slopes of\r\nthis range. Some fine argillaceous rocks exposed half-way up on either\r\nside show no lime and contain no organic remains. One specimen beside me\r\nis certainly a disintegrated basic rock. No agglomerates came under my\r\nnotice. In the absence or rarity of detrital rocks this part of the\r\nrange resembles the adjacent mountain of Seatura.\r\n\r\nAlthough olivine-basalts prevail in this part of the Seatovo Range there\r\nis great variety in their characters; and it does not appear possible to\r\nexplain such a diversity except to assume that we have here an old\r\ncrateral ridge which has again and again been penetrated by dykes and\r\nhas since been greatly denuded. We have here one of those singular\r\nmountain-ridges that characterise the central portion of the island, but\r\ndiffering in this respect that the submarine tuffs and agglomerates,\r\nwhich there occur on the surface, even in the higher levels, are here\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nSOLEVU BAY.—There are few localities in the island where so many kinds\r\nof basic rocks are displayed as around Solevu Bay. In addition to the\r\nprevailing blackish porphyritic basalts and basaltic andesites, there\r\nare grey porphyritic basalts, grey non-porphyritic basalts, black\r\nbasalts with abundant large crystals of olivine, &c., all of which have\r\ntheir distinctive characters.\r\n\r\nThis picturesque bay is surrounded by hills. On the west side it is\r\ninclosed by the promontory forming the southern extension of the Seatovo\r\nrange which, culminating in Ulu-i-matua, or the “Head-of-the-Strong”\r\npeak, descends at first steeply and then gradually to the coast, where\r\nit projects as Vulavulandre Point. On the east side is a broken line of\r\nhills, of which Koro-i-rea, the hill known to the natives as the “Town\r\nof the Albinos,” is the most conspicuous. Beyond it stretches the\r\neastern point of the bay, which the Fijians call “Ua-nguru,” that is,\r\n“the noise of the waves.” On the shores lie the village of Nawaindo,\r\n“the running-stream,” and the once populous town of Solevu, which has\r\ngiven its name to the bay. Solevu, as its name indicates, is the place\r\nof the “great assembly.” In the background rises the three-peaked\r\nmountain of Koro-tolutolu, “the three towns,” which forms a continuation\r\ninland of the eastern arm of the bay, and joins the Seatovo Range at the\r\nhead of it. Between these two ranges inclosing the bay lies the valley\r\nof Solevu, down which descends the Solevu River to the sea. In ascending\r\nthis valley from the shore, one rises only about 100 feet above the sea\r\nfor the first mile or two.\r\n\r\nThe promontory, which in the even-topped Ulu-i-matua or Solevu Peak,\r\nattains a height of 1,100 feet above the sea, displays on its summit and\r\non its eastern slopes descending to the Solevu river, and on its western\r\nslopes reaching down to the coast at Vuia, more or less porphyritic\r\nblackish olivine-basalts of the usual type with specific gravity\r\n2·88-2·90. These basaltic rocks contain scanty olivine and only a little\r\ninterstitial glass. The felspars of the groundmass vary in different\r\nlocalities from ·11 to ·15 mm. in average length. The rocks belong to\r\ngenus 37 of the olivine class which is described on page 262.\r\n\r\nThey are in the lower regions often decomposed to a considerable depth,\r\nthe spheroidal structure being well displayed during the weathering\r\nprocess. Where this promontory terminates in the low Vulavulandre point,\r\nthese rocks give place in part to grey porphyritic olivine-basalts, with\r\nspecific gravity 2·79-2·83, which from the abundance of the macroscopic\r\nopaque felspar look like porphyrites. They come near to the rocks\r\nexposed on the north slopes of Seatura and in the Seatovo Range. At the\r\nend of the point they become scoriaceous and more vitreous; but with\r\nthis exception they contain but little glass. They vary somewhat in\r\ncharacter and are referred to genera 2 and 38 of the olivine-class.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing rock in the interior of the Ua-nguru promontory to the\r\nsouth of Koro-i-rea is the blackish porphyritic basalt, containing a\r\nlittle olivine, and often much decomposed; but at the point and on the\r\neast shores of Solevu Bay, there is a considerable variation in the\r\ncharacter of the basic rocks, of which the two following are the most\r\nconspicuous. Near the village of Nawaindo, there is an apparent\r\nintrusion of a black lava-like basalt of high basicity (specific gravity\r\n3·01) showing abundant large olivine crystals, five or six mm. across,\r\nwith some porphyritic augite, but no macroscopic felspar. At the point\r\nthe rock is somewhat scoriaceous, with calcite occasionally filling the\r\ncavities, whilst the olivine is so thoroughly hæmatised that it glistens\r\nlike brown mica. The compact rock contains a little devitrified\r\ninterstitial glass, the felspar-lathes being unusually small, their\r\naverage length being only ·07 mm. It belongs to genus 15, the most basic\r\nof the genera of the olivine class represented in the island. The second\r\nrock to be noticed is a slightly altered compact basalt without olivine\r\nforming apparently a dyke near the coast about half way between the\r\nvillage of Solevu and Ua-nguru Point. It has a specific gravity of 2·84,\r\nthe felspar lathes (·15 mm.) presenting a marked flow-arrangement,\r\nwhilst there is a fair amount of altered residual glass in irregular\r\nspaces, a millimetre in size. The rock, on account of its\r\njoint-structure, could be easily worked as a building-stone. It is\r\nreferred to genus 16, species B, of the augite andesites.\r\n\r\nThe hill of Koro-i-rea, which rises on the east side of the bay to a\r\nheight of 850 feet, has a ridge-shaped summit. Its upper half is\r\ncomposed of a bluish-grey rock looking like a phonolite and usually\r\ncompact, except at the top of the hill, where it is a little\r\nscoriaceous. It has, however, a specific gravity of 2·91 or 2·92, and is\r\nin fact a pretty grey olivine-basalt studded with small olivine crystals\r\nabout a millimetre in size and showing no other phenocrysts. This type\r\nof olivine-basalt occurs also at Ulu-i-ndali on the east side of Wainunu\r\nBay, but is rare in the island. It differs amongst other features from\r\nthe porphyritic olivine-basalts of the northern part of Seatura and of\r\nthe Seatovo range in the absence of plagioclase phenocrysts. There is\r\napparently no interstitial glass, whilst the average length of the more\r\nor less parallel felspar-lathes is ·13 mm.[41] On the lower slopes of\r\nthe hill the common blackish porphyritic basalt or basaltic andesite is\r\nexposed. In the grey-basaltic upper portion of this hill we have\r\nprobably an old volcanic “neck.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the line of hills inland from Koro-i-rea, we cross the\r\nintervening saddle 450 feet above the sea, and ascend the slopes of\r\nKoro-tolutolu, a ridge-shaped mountain backing Solevu Bay, and having,\r\nas its name indicates, three peaks, of which the highest is 1,280 feet\r\nabove the sea. My observations indicate that this mountain is formed in\r\nmass of the common blackish-basalts described under genus 37, their\r\nspecific gravity being 2·88 to 2·94. But Koro-tolutolu has also the\r\npeculiarity that it appears to be in mass magnetic. The rocks obtained\r\nfrom its summit, half-way up its western slopes, and near its foot on\r\nthe same side, all display polarity, a character also of the rocks of\r\nthe neighbouring hills of Ulu-i-matua and Koro-i-rea, but in their cases\r\nseemingly confined to the higher levels.[42]\r\n\r\nNeither tuffs nor agglomerates came under my notice at Solevu Bay. This\r\nappears to be an ancient corner of the island, from which denudation has\r\nstripped off nearly everything that could guide us in speculating as to\r\nits past. Although the hills of Koro-i-rea and Koro-tolutolu doubtless\r\nrepresent old volcanic necks, the relation of Ulu-i-matua to the very\r\ndifferently composed northern part of the same range, as described on\r\npage 73, is extremely puzzling. Then again in the opposite sides of\r\nSolevu Bay we see exposed the remains of lava-flows that bear no\r\nrelation to the present configuration of the surface. We may suspect,\r\nhowever, that most of the volcanic energy was displayed under the sea.\r\n\r\nNANDI BAY.—Lying north of Solevu Bay, this bay is situated between\r\nspurs, descending to the coast from the mountainous interior. The valley\r\nextends a long distance inland without much change of level, the\r\nelevation 1½ miles from the coast being not over 100 feet above the sea.\r\nAt its head is the Nandi Gorge, which leads into the Ndriti Basin, the\r\ngreat crateral cavity of Seatura. There are some remarkable lofty,\r\nisolated hills in this valley that would be well worth examining.\r\n\r\nThat the bay represents the site of an old volcanic centre is indicated\r\nby the occurrence on the shore of two basaltic dykes, one on either side\r\nof the village of Na Savu and 300 to 400 yards apart. The eastern dyke\r\nis perhaps 30 feet thick, whilst that to the west is scarcely half this\r\nthickness. They exhibit an imperfect columnar structure, the columns,\r\nwhich are 6 to 12 inches across, being inclined at an angle of 15° or\r\n20° from the vertical in such a way that it may be inferred that the\r\nmolten material was ejected from some subterranean focus lying to the\r\nnorthward (or inland) at an angle of 15° or 20° above the horizon. The\r\nbasalt is a compact bluish-black rock with specific gravity 2·95-2·99.\r\nIt contains abundant olivine but no other phenocrysts and very scanty\r\ninterstitial glass, whilst the felspar-lathes average ·1 mm. in length.\r\nIt is referred to genus 16 of the olivine basalts, and is remarkable for\r\nthe flow arrangement not only of the felspar-lathes but also of the\r\nsmaller olivine crystals.\r\n\r\nBlackish basaltic rocks of the prevailing type are exposed on the\r\nsurface of the broad spur, not over 500 feet in height, that divides the\r\nNandi and Nasawana valleys and descends to the coast between the two\r\nbays thus named. They belong to genus 37 of the olivine-basalts and\r\ndisplay a few small plagioclase phenocrysts. The felspar-lathes average\r\n·2 mm. in length, and there is a little interstitial glass. Entering\r\nNasawana Bay we find ourselves on the southern slopes of Seatura, of\r\nwhich the high Na Suva range that backs the bay is the southern\r\nextension.\r\n\r\nTHE TABLE-LAND OF NA SAVU.—This remarkable plateau has an elevation\r\nvarying usually between 700 and 800 feet above the sea and a maximum\r\nbreadth of four or five miles. It is an area of basic agglomerates and\r\nbasic tuffs and lies in the hollow between the basaltic mountain of\r\nSeatura and the acid andesitic hilly region of Ndrandramea. For the\r\nconvenience of description I have named it after the picturesque falls\r\nof Na Savu[43] at its southern edge. These falls are celebrated in\r\nFijian tradition; and from the brink in old time the native desirous of\r\nending his life leapt into the gorge below.\r\n\r\nAfter flowing sluggishly along on the surface of the table-land, the\r\nMbutu-mbutu River arrives suddenly at the edge of a line of cliffs of\r\nvolcanic agglomerate, that here form the southern border of the plateau,\r\nand with a volume 30 to 40 feet across, it plunges down into the ravine\r\n150 feet below. As shown in the view from the gorge below, there is a\r\nbreak in the middle of the descent. These falls, however, are not easily\r\naccessible. They are best approached by proceeding from Wainunu to\r\nNdawathumi and thence up the gorge of the Mbutu-mbutu River.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the plateau of Na Savu is densely wooded. In places it is\r\nmarshy, and here thrives the Giant Sedge (Scirpodendron costatum). The\r\nMakita tree (Parinarium laurinum) also flourishes in the wet districts;\r\nand in the drier localities occur the Ndakua (Dammara vitiensis) and the\r\nNdamanu (Calophyllum-burmanni) together with a palm of the genus\r\nVeitchia. Here on this level watershed between the basins of the Wainunu\r\nand Sarawanga rivers, the sluggish streams flow aimlessly along in but\r\nslightly eroded channels; and it is not always possible to determine the\r\nside of the island to which they ultimately direct their course. In\r\ntheir beds are pebbles and irregularly formed concretions of an impure\r\nreddish flint which I have described on page 354. On the north and south\r\nsides the table-land is much excavated by the tributaries of the\r\nSarawanga and Wainunu rivers. On the west where it meets the foot of the\r\nSeatura slope portions of columns of basaltic rocks appear on the\r\nsurface, and deep gorges are worn by the large streams descending from\r\nthe mountain. On the east towards Nuku-ni-tambua and Tambu-lotu, the\r\nsurface is also much cut up. The preservation of this table-land in a\r\nregion, where the denuding agencies are very active in their operations\r\nall around it, is to be attributed to its being a level watershed, where\r\nthe head-waters of the Wainunu and Sarawanga rivers in part take their\r\nrise but have little or no eroding power.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to obtain a good general view of the district of the\r\nfalls on account of the dense forest-growth. When making the traverse\r\nfrom Tambu-lotu to Ndawa-thumi, it is observed that there is here a\r\nsingular hollow, about half a mile in length, which receives the falls\r\nat the western end. The river crosses this hollow and is at once\r\nreceived into the gorge below, but there is no stream to explain the\r\norigin of the cavity. On its north side the cliffs of agglomerate rise\r\nto a height of 150 to 200 feet from their base, but on the south the\r\nsides are much lower. Here there seem to be the remains of the crater of\r\nthe ancient vent from which all the tuffs and agglomerates of the\r\ndistrict were derived. We must look for their origin in the vicinity,\r\nand the only evidence of a crateral cavity is this streamless hollow\r\nextending east from the falls of Na Savu.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the basic tuffs and agglomerates of this plateau it\r\nmay be observed that they cover the massive basic rocks and are probably\r\nnot over 100 or 150 feet in maximum thickness. They are well exposed\r\nwhere the streams cut into the borders of the plateau. The tuffs are\r\nsometimes bedded and slightly inclined, and they may be fine or coarse\r\ngrained. They are more or less palagonitised hyalomelane-tuffs, being\r\ncomposed mainly of fragments of a basic glass, often finely vesicular\r\nand even fibrillar, the vacuoles being filled with different materials,\r\nwhilst the palagonitisation is well advanced. Sometimes they have a\r\nbrecciated appearance, and in that case when the alteration of the basic\r\nglass is very extensive we find angular fragments, 1 to 2 inches across,\r\nof a greenish palagonite imbedded in a pale matrix of palagonitic\r\ndebris, the whole rock having a soapy feel and a steatitic appearance.\r\nThis is well shown on the sides of the stream-course at Ndawathumi which\r\nlies at the border of the table-land. These tuffs effervesce but\r\nslightly with an acid.\r\n\r\nThe basic agglomerate is displayed in the face of the falls and in the\r\ngorges. The blocks are as a rule composed of semi-vitreous basaltic\r\nandesites of varying type, showing no olivine and containing a fair\r\namount of smoky glass in the groundmass. At times they are scoriaceous\r\nand display amygdules of calcite or a zeolite. In places the rock shows\r\nlarge phenocrysts of plagioclase and a semi-ophitic groundmass, when it\r\nis referred to the porphyritic group of genus 9 of the augite-class. In\r\na few of the scoriaceous blocks the augite of the groundmass is for the\r\nmost part prismatic and rarely granular (genus 5).\r\n\r\nThe massive rocks underlying the agglomerates in the vicinity of Na Savu\r\nare aphanitic augite-andesites, differing in important characters from\r\nthe rocks of the agglomerates. They probably represent ancient lava\r\nflows of the Na Savu vent. They are compact (sp. gr. 2·72-2·76), and\r\ndisplay a groundmass formed of a felt of felspar-lathes, averaging ·05\r\nor ·06 mm. only in length, and in flow-arrangement. That occurring just\r\nbelow the falls is almost aphanitic, but is referred to genus 13,\r\nspecies A, sub-species _a_, of the augite-andesites. The rock from the\r\ngorge below is of the same character, but on account of its opaque\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts it is referred to genus 14, and is described on\r\np. 279.\r\n\r\nIn one place on the plateau a tuff-agglomerate is penetrated by veins, a\r\nfew inches thick, formed apparently of a finely brecciated tuff of basic\r\nglass fragments in a palagonitic matrix. It is, however, pointed out on\r\np. 340 that they were originally veins of basaltic glass which have been\r\nsubjected to crushing, and that the palagonite has since been produced.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this description of the table-land of Na Savu, it may be\r\ninferred that the source of its basic tuffs and agglomerates is to be\r\nfound in the same locality; and probably the original vent is now\r\nrepresented by the hollow extending eastward from the falls. With the\r\nexception of a large block of silicified coral found in the vicinity of\r\nNdawathumi and of the impure flints of the surface of the plateau, which\r\nare described on pages 354, &c., no direct testimony of its submarine\r\norigin offered itself to me. The palagonitic characters of the tuffs\r\nafford, however, indirect evidence in this connection; and indeed the\r\noccurrence of submarine tuffs and limestones in the vicinity of\r\nTembenindio on its lower northern slopes (see page 131), and the\r\nexistence at elevations of several hundred feet above the sea of\r\nfossiliferous tuffs and clays in the Wainunu and Ndrandramea districts\r\nto the eastward, afford strong presumptive evidence that the tuffs and\r\nagglomerates of the table-land were deposited under the sea, and I may\r\nadd in a period subsequent to that of the formation of the great\r\nbasaltic flows of Seatura and Wainunu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASALTIC PLATEAU OF WAINUNU.—This table-land extends for a distance\r\nof seven miles from the base of the Ndrandramea mountains in the heart\r\nof the island, where it is elevated 1,100 to 1,200 feet above the sea,\r\nto the valley immediately north of the hill of Ulu-i-ndali, where within\r\na short distance of its termination it still retains a height of 700 to\r\n800 feet. Limited on the west by the valley of the Wainunu River and on\r\nthe east by that of the Yanawai River, its breadth varies usually\r\nbetween four or five miles. It is best seen in profile when viewed from\r\nthe south-west on the western shores of Wainunu Bay, between Korolevu\r\nand Nasawana, when it presents itself to the eye as a table-land,\r\ndescending with a very gradual slope from the interior towards the\r\ncoast. From such a point of view the two great basaltic slopes of\r\nSeatura and Wainunu may be seen together, the former descending eastward\r\nto the Wainunu valley at an angle of 3 or 4 degrees, the latter\r\ndescending at right angles to it to the southward with a similar small\r\ngradient of 2 or 3 degrees.\r\n\r\nIn the profile of the island attached to this work the Seatura slope is\r\nwell shown; but that of the Wainunu table-land being seen from the south\r\nis represented only by a level contour-line at the base of the\r\nNdrandramea mountains. The two great series of basaltic flows, though\r\nclosely approaching in a direction at right angles to each other, do not\r\ncome into actual contact, and the intervening space is now occupied by\r\nthe valley of the Wainunu River. In the accompanying rude outline-sketch\r\nof this region, as seen from off the mouth of the Wainunu estuary, the\r\nrelation of this valley to the two great series of basaltic flows is\r\nclearly shown. On the left is the foot of the Seatura basaltic slope; on\r\nthe right is the Wainunu basaltic table-land; and between them lie the\r\nestuary and valley of the Wainunu, at the back of which appears the “Na\r\nSavu” table-land, formed of basic tuffs and agglomerates. Behind all\r\nthere rise up suddenly the Ndrandramea mountains formed of acid\r\nandesites; whilst in the foreground to the right is the hill of\r\nUlu-i-ndali, which is composed in the mass of a grey basalt of a type\r\nquite different from the blackish basaltic rocks of the Seatura slope\r\nand of the Wainunu table-land. It was from this view off the mouth of\r\nthe estuary that I received my first lesson in studying the structural\r\nformation of the island. I kept it always in my mind’s eye, and for\r\nmonths in an almost unmapped region it was my only guide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profile, looking north from off the mouth of the Wainunu\r\nRiver.]\r\n\r\nThe gradual slope of the Wainunu table-land from an elevation of 1,100\r\nor 1,200 feet in the interior to 700 or 800 feet near the coast has\r\nalready been referred to. Beyond this lower limit it descends much more\r\nrapidly and within less than a mile it terminates at Masusu in a\r\nsteep-sided declivity 300 feet high opposite Ulu-i-ndali, and in a\r\ngentler slope on the eastern side in the Ndranimako district. Its\r\nsomewhat undulating surface is well wooded; but on account of the small\r\ngradient the small streams on the table-land do not excavate deep\r\nchannels, but flow slowly along in shallow courses and often stagnate in\r\nswampy land where the interesting “Scirpodendron costatum,” the\r\ngiant-sedge, flourishes. In their beds occur reddish flinty concretions,\r\nup to 3 inches across in size, and magnetic iron sand in great\r\nabundance. A sample of this sand roughly washed on the spot contains 77\r\nper cent. of magnetic iron.[44]\r\n\r\nBasaltic rocks, often exhibiting a columnar structure, are exposed at\r\nintervals on the surface and slopes of this table-land all over its\r\narea. Now and then when traversing this region one comes upon a tract\r\nstrewn with large blocks, amongst which occur fragments of huge columns\r\n3 to 4 feet in diameter; but it is on the steep southern slopes of the\r\nplateau in the vicinity of Ndavutu and Masusu that the most extensive\r\nexposures of columnar basalt are to be found. Here there have been large\r\nclearings made for the tea-plantations, and portions of columns 2 to 3\r\nfeet in thickness are scattered all over the slopes and surface of\r\nMasusu.\r\n\r\nA very interesting exposure occurs on the southern edge of the Masusu\r\nflat facing Ulu-i-ndali. Here there is displayed in the face of a\r\nwaterfall a mass of basalt about 40 feet deep, formed of regular\r\ncross-jointed columns, 3 to 4 feet in diameter and often pentagonal in\r\nshape, which are almost perpendicular, being inclined about five degrees\r\nfrom the vertical. But in the upper portion of the fall the columns are\r\nsmaller (2 to 3 feet across) and become arched and nearly horizontal.\r\nThis was the only section of the inner mass of the basaltic flows that I\r\nfound, and here the columns are almost vertical. In this locality\r\nseveral other exposures of the columnar basalt occur; but they are all\r\nat the surface and the columns are nearly horizontal or very much\r\ninclined from the vertical, being often pentagonal in form, 2 to 3 feet\r\nacross, and sometimes curved with joints 10 to 20 feet in length.\r\n\r\nNeither vesicular nor scoriaceous rocks came under my notice in this\r\nregion, and the presence of pteropod-ooze deposits and of foraminiferous\r\nclays and tuffs on the slopes of the basaltic tableland indicates that\r\nthe flows were submarine. The common character of a sub-aërial basaltic\r\nflow, where there are large vertical columns below and smaller radiating\r\ncolumns above, did not present itself; and it is probable that the\r\nsingular arrangement of the columns in the upper portion of these flows\r\nmay be connected with the conditions of depth under which the flows took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the description given by Dana of the columnar basalt\r\nof Tahiti[45] that it was formed under different conditions from those\r\nunder which the basaltic flows of Wainunu and Seatura were formed. The\r\ncolumns composing a cliff 500 feet high in the Matavai valley were 10 to\r\n20 inches across. A bluff, 200 to 300 feet high, in another part of the\r\nvalley, was made up of columns 5 to 8 inches in width. The tallest cliff\r\ndisplayed in places converging and curved columns, which is attributed\r\nto the unequal cooling of the interior of the mass; but it is evident\r\nfrom a diagram given by the author that the columns were not inclined at\r\na large angle from the perpendicular.[46] He also refers to some prisms\r\nof a grey basalt exposed just below the Wailuku Falls near Hilo in the\r\nlarge island of Hawaii which were 8 feet in diameter and were surmounted\r\nby others only 1 to 4 feet across.\r\n\r\nThe basalts of the Wainunu table-land are blackish and non-vesicular,\r\nwith a density of 2·87 to 2·90. They all carry olivine and\r\nmicroporphyritic plagioclase, and display a little interstitial glass,\r\nand the felspar-lathes are usually in plexus-arrangement, being stout\r\nand often showing twin lamellæ. But the rocks exhibit important\r\nvariations in different localities as regards the amount of olivine, the\r\nlength of the felspar-lathes, the presence or absence of the ophitic\r\ncharacter, &c., and they are grouped in different genera of the olivine\r\nclass (1, 13, 25, 33). Probably the type of genus 25, with scanty\r\nolivine and granular augite, would prevail.\r\n\r\nFrom the varying size of the felspars of the groundmass it is apparent\r\nthat the flows are not all of the same character. At Masusu, where the\r\nrock is doleritic in texture, they average from ·25 to ·3 mm. in length.\r\nA mile further north, they are about ·17 mm. long, and two miles more to\r\nthe north they average only ·1 mm. in length. It is probable that a\r\nsemi-vitreous basaltic andesite (spec. grav. 2·73), that shows no\r\nolivine and is referred to the porphyritic sub-genus of genus 9 of the\r\naugite-andesites, which is exposed in the stream-courses near the base\r\nof the dacitic mountains of the interior, is the product of a later\r\neruption. Occasionally one finds, as at Thongea in the Wainunu valley, a\r\nbasalt rich in olivine (spec. grav. 2·95), the felspars of the base\r\naveraging ·1 mm. in length. It may be remarked here that one cannot draw\r\na sharp distinction between the basalts of this region and those of the\r\nadjacent eastern slope of Seatura. Their specific gravity is about the\r\nsame (2·87 to 2·90); but the coarse texture of the Masusu basalts did\r\nnot come under my notice in the last locality, where the felspars of the\r\ngroundmass average ·18 mm. in length or about two-thirds the length of\r\nthose of the Masusu rocks.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the section across this part of the island, it will be\r\nobserved that the basaltic lavas of this table-land must have issued\r\nfrom some fissure near the south side of the base of the Ndrandramea\r\nmountains. In crossing the head of this plateau on the way from Nambuna\r\nto Ndrawa one passes from the region of the acid andesites into that of\r\nthe basalts. The track first skirts the base of Mount Wawa-Levu, where\r\nthe prevailing altered dacitic rocks are exposed in a much decomposed\r\ncondition in the stream-courses. Then there is a gradual ascent through\r\nsomewhat broken country to reach the western slope of the table-land,\r\nand here are at first displayed the semi-vitreous basaltic andesites\r\njust referred to.\r\n\r\nThe Wainunu table-land is bisected in a singular fashion by the Ndavutu\r\nRiver. Since, however, the deep and often gorge-like channel of the\r\nriver displays submarine deposits incrusting the basaltic slopes on its\r\nsides, it is evident that the break in the basaltic table-land existed\r\nin part at least before the emergence.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the total thickness of the basaltic flows of this plateau\r\nI have only a few data. In the bed of the Ndavutu River opposite\r\nVunivuvundi, and about 400 feet above the sea, there is exposed a\r\ngreyish porphyritic rock showing pyrites, apparently an altered\r\nandesite. If this is the bed-rock, the basaltic plateau in that locality\r\nwould be 300 to 400 feet in thickness. This is rather over the thickness\r\nof the end of the table-land at Masusu.\r\n\r\nI pass on now to consider briefly the submarine deposits that overlie\r\nthe marginal slopes of this basaltic table-land in places. They are for\r\nthe most part pteropod and foraminiferous ooze-rocks and are extensively\r\nrepresented on the surface and slopes of the Nandua flat to the north of\r\nNdavutu, where they occur at all elevations up to 500 feet above the\r\nsea. They are also displayed on the eastern slopes overlooking the\r\nYanawai but at rather lower heights; and little patches of them occur\r\nhere and there in different places but not exceeding 500 feet in\r\nelevation. These friable clayey rocks, which contain from 30 to 40 per\r\ncent. of carbonate of lime, are described in detail on page 320. It may\r\nhowever be remarked here that these deposits are but partly derived from\r\nthe degradation of the submerged basaltic table-land or from the\r\nwashings of a basaltic coast. They were formed in a clear sea-way, but\r\nprobably at no great depth, at a time when the basaltic plateau was\r\nsubmerged below the level of breaker-action.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that these deposits do not repose directly on the\r\nbasaltic rock. In one place below the Nandua tea-plantation, where there\r\nis a steep descent to the river of about 250 feet, the pteropod\r\nooze-rock, which is exposed in the upper half, passes down into a\r\nchocolate-coloured marl that contains 5 per cent. of carbonate of lime\r\nand is horizontally bedded. It is composed in the main of fine\r\npalagonitic debris, with some fragments of minerals, &c., and contains a\r\nfew microscopic tests of foraminifera. This deposit passes down into\r\napparently a rock of pure palagonite. The succession of these beds and\r\ntheir characters are described more in detail on page 344; and as\r\nindicated in the diagram there given it is to be inferred that a very\r\nextensive formation of palagonite has taken place on the surface of a\r\nsubmarine basaltic flow.\r\n\r\nOn a similar slope of the Nandua district, and about half a mile nearer\r\nNdavutu, the pteropod ooze-rock overlies a coarse zeolitic\r\npalagonite-tuff composed in great part of fragments of a highly altered\r\nvacuolar basic glass, but without organic remains. These tuffs are\r\nhorizontally stratified. Tuffs precisely similar occur on the northern\r\nslopes of Ulu-i-ndali three miles to the south. They are all described\r\nin detail on page 335.\r\n\r\nSome miles up the valley of the Ndavutu River on the steep slope\r\ndescending from Vunivuvundi to the river, and on the sides of the river\r\nlower down, are exposed dark palagonitic and sometimes calcareous clays\r\nand tuffs. I traced them as high as 450 feet above the sea where they\r\nwere bedded and dipped gently to the west. In the river-channel they\r\nwere mostly confined to the right bank, the slope on the other side\r\nbeing strewn with large fragments of columnar basalt. At the mouth of\r\nthe Ndavutu River, there are exposed tufaceous sandstones and a\r\ntuff-conglomerate, probably in great part formed of palagonitic\r\nmaterials, but I have kept no specimens.\r\n\r\nThere is much that is puzzling about the tuffs of the region between\r\nNdavutu and Vunivuvundi. The surface pteropod and foraminiferous\r\nooze-rocks, that are found here and on the Yanawai or eastern border of\r\nthe basaltic plateau and in other localities, offer no difficulties; but\r\nthe origin of the palagonitic tuffs that in places lie beneath them is\r\nnot so easy to explain. At Mr. Simpson’s old estate on the Nandua flat\r\none finds numbers of huge blocks of columnar basalt scattered about on\r\nthe slope descending to the river; and in places there is exposed in a\r\nsmall stream, up to a height of 500 feet, a fossiliferous ooze-rock\r\ncontaining marine shells. The ooze-rock is evidently an incrusting\r\ndeposit; but when one goes down to the river-side, which is there about\r\n200 feet above the sea, one finds displayed _in situ_ in the river-bed\r\nan amygdaloidal basic lava with coarse tuffs and agglomerates a little\r\nlower down.\r\n\r\nTHE HILL OF ULU-I-NDALI.—The meaning of the name of this hill is “Head\r\nof the rope.” It is noted on account of the dense growth of tall forest\r\ntrees that clothes its surface, such as the Vesi (Afzelia bijuga), the\r\nNdamanu (Calophyllum burmanni), the Ndakua (Dammara vitiensis), the\r\nWathi-wathi (Sterculia sp.) &c.; and it may be that its name is\r\nconnected with the launching of the large canoes that were at one time\r\nconstructed on its slopes.\r\n\r\nUlu-i-ndali, which has a broad level summit 1,100 to 1,150 feet in\r\nheight, rises on the left side of the mouth of the Wainunu estuary. Its\r\nrelation to the surrounding region is partly shown in the rough sketch\r\ngiven on page 83. It is separated from the basaltic table-land to the\r\nnorth by a deep and wide valley, the bottom of which is raised only a\r\nfew feet above the sea; the small stream known as Ndawa-ndingo, that\r\napparently flows through it, is merely a branch of the Wainunu estuary,\r\nthe tide ascending it for some distance. This singular valley, like the\r\nmain valley of the Wainunu, dates back in great part to the period\r\npreceding the emergence of this region. The steep basaltic slopes of\r\nMasusu, strewn with fragments of large columns, bound it on the north.\r\nOn its south side are the lower slopes of Ulu-i-ndali which are composed\r\nof volcanic tuffs.\r\n\r\nA long spur descends to the south from Ulu-i-ndali to form the rocky\r\npromontory of Vatu Vono or “Stone turtle,” so-named from the fanciful\r\nresemblance of the large rounded blocks of basalt on the shore to the\r\nbacks of turtles. To the south-east extend the low tuff-formed Ravi-ravi\r\nplains which are but slightly elevated above the sea. The Ulu-i-ndali\r\nrange is apparently connected by a “col” with a range of similar height\r\nto the eastward, the highest peak of which is about 3 miles distant.\r\n\r\nA more or less coarse doleritic grey olivine-basalt forms the mass of\r\nthis hill and is chiefly exposed in its upper portion. Around its\r\nslopes, extending from the coast usually halfway up the hill, are\r\nblackish-brown olivine-basalts; they differ amongst other points from\r\nthe grey basalts—which are practically holocrystalline, in their greater\r\namount of interstitial glass, to which, doubtless, is due their dark\r\ncolour. These dark basalts also occur scantily on the summit; but from\r\ntheir greater prevalence on the lower slopes and from some other of\r\ntheir characters, it may be inferred that they are in the main formed at\r\nthe surface. Outside all, on the north and south sides of the hill, are\r\nexposed coarse tuffs composed of fragments of palagonitised vacuolar\r\nbasic glass and containing much secondary zeolitic and calcitic\r\nmaterials. They are purely of eruptive origin, and although containing\r\nno organic remains were doubtless, as in the case of the precisely\r\nsimilar tuffs of the neighbouring district of Nandua, deposited under\r\nthe sea. A description of their characters is given on page 335. Such\r\ntuffs extend as high as 300 feet above the sea on the north-west slopes,\r\nwhere there are exposures, 10 to 12 feet in thickness, in the dry stream\r\ncourses; and here they may be seen overlying the basalt and rudely\r\nbedded, dipping away from the summit at an angle of 15 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe grey olivine-basalts of Ulu-i-ndali, which often look like\r\nclinkstone, range generally in specific gravity from 2·9 to 2·95. They\r\ncontain microporphyritic olivine in abundance, which is usually more or\r\nless hæmatised and in extreme cases of the change looks like brown mica.\r\nMost of them are referred to genus 16 of the olivine class and their\r\ncharacters will be found described on page 258. The felspar-lathes are\r\nstout and show sometimes lamellar twinning, and on account of their\r\nlarge size (·2 to ·5 mm in average length) the rock acquires a doleritic\r\ntexture. They display as a rule a flow arrangement around the olivine\r\ncrystals. Augite granules occur in great abundance, and there is rarely\r\nany interstitial glass.\r\n\r\nThese grey olivine-basalts are as a rule non-vesicular, but rocks with\r\nminute irregular cavities, though without glass, occur scantily on the\r\nupper slopes. They come near to the grey olivine-basalts of the hill of\r\nKoro-i-rea in the Solevu district, as described on page 77; but they\r\ndiffer in their doleritic or coarser texture, the felspar-lathes in the\r\nlast-named locality being much smaller, their average length being\r\n·12 mm.\r\n\r\nThe blackish basalts, mostly characteristic of the lower slopes of\r\nUlu-i-ndali, vary somewhat in character; but they may on the whole be\r\nregarded as surface forms of the more deeply situated grey basalts which\r\nare practically holocrystalline. The rock of this kind that prevails on\r\nthe south and west sides has a specific gravity of 2·96. It is referred\r\nto the same genus (16) as the grey basalts, but differs from them in the\r\ncircumstance that the microporphyritic olivine is serpentinised and not\r\nhæmatised, and in the occurrence of a fair amount of devitrified\r\ninterstitial glass, to which probably the dark colour of the rock is\r\ndue.... The dark aphanitic basalt, with flinty fracture and a specific\r\ngravity of 3·00, that is displayed in Vatu Vono Point, is merely a\r\ncompact surface variety of the more coarse-textured grey basalts, being\r\nreferred to the same genus. Here there is a great abundance of\r\nmicroporphyritic olivine in a groundmass of parallel felspar-lathes and\r\naugite grains; but the felspars are unusually small, averaging ·1 mm. in\r\nlength; and there is a much larger amount of fine magnetite than in the\r\ngrey basalts. There seems to be no interstitial glass; and the olivine\r\nwhen not fresh is usually serpentinised but occasionally hæmatised.\r\n\r\nThe dark basalts of Ulu-i-ndali when they occur on its upper slopes\r\nbecome ophitic. A specimen lying beside me has a specific gravity of\r\n2·91. Allowing for the structural differences, it appears as an ophitic\r\nsurface variety of the deeper seated grey basalts. A description of it\r\nis given under genus 12 on page 256, of which it forms the type.\r\n\r\nFrom the data above given, the hill of Ulu-i-ndali is to be regarded as\r\nthe basal portion of a submarine volcano still retaining part of its\r\nash-coverings. The grey doleritic basalts probably represent the core\r\nand the dark fine-grained basalts represent the flows of this ancient\r\nvent.\r\n\r\nTHE KUMBULAU PENINSULA.—South-east of Ulu-i-ndali stretches a remarkable\r\n“talasinga” district which for convenience I will call the peninsula of\r\nKumbulau. Its south or seaward border is broken and hilly, and presents\r\nan irregular line of hills 300 to 470 feet in height, extending from\r\nKumbulau Point to Soni-soni Island, which is almost connected with the\r\ncoast. The rest of the peninsula is a low-lying and often marshy plain,\r\nwhich, though elevated in some places 20 to 25 feet above the sea, is\r\nusually much lower. On the north-east side of the isthmus is the narrow\r\nNandi inlet, bordered by low mangrove-belts, which represents the broad\r\nchannel that in a very recent period of the island’s history cut through\r\nthe present neck of the peninsula between the head of the Nandi inlet\r\nand Ravi-ravi.\r\n\r\nStratified and often steeply inclined tuff-sandstones and clays, more or\r\nless basic and palagonitic in character, form together with basaltic\r\nagglomerates the prevailing rocks of the peninsula, whether in the hilly\r\nportion or in the plains. They belong to the basic tuffs of mixed\r\ncomposition described on page 330; and though the agency of eruptions\r\ncan be recognised in their components they are also the products of\r\nmarine erosion.\r\n\r\nSome of the hills represent volcanic “necks”; whilst the low narrow\r\npromontory between Kiombo and Soni-soni Island has been formed by an old\r\nbasaltic flow.\r\n\r\nI will begin the description of this peninsula with the eastern\r\nextremity north of Kumbulau Point, the interior of which is cut up into\r\nridgy hills 300 to 350 feet in height. On its eastern coast are exposed\r\nvolcanic agglomerates, composed of large blocks, which from their\r\ndimensions given below would weigh between one-third and two-thirds of a\r\nton, a size indicating the immediate vicinity of the vent, now\r\nobliterated, from which they were originally ejected. Near Kumbulau\r\nPoint the blocks, which are made of basaltic andesite, measure five or\r\nsix cubic feet. Further north in the vicinity of Vatu-Ndamu, the\r\nprecipitous coast cliffs are composed of agglomerates, the large blocks\r\nof which, often ten cubic feet in dimension, are formed, not of the\r\nprevailing basaltic andesites, as in other parts of the peninsula, but\r\nof a grey hornblende-andesite. This singular appearance of an acid\r\nandesite in a region of basic rocks has no doubt given rise to the\r\nnative name of Vatu-Ndamu, “the red or brown stone.” It belongs to the\r\nsecond order of the hornblende-hypersthene-andesites, and is described\r\non page 298.\r\n\r\nProceeding along the south coast westward from Kumbulau Point, before\r\narriving at the village of Na Tokalau we pass from the district of\r\nagglomerates into that of the bedded tufaceous sandstones and clays\r\nwhich are exposed all along the coast to Kiombo about three miles away.\r\nThe transition is indicated by the agglomerates becoming interstratified\r\nwith the tuff-beds. These sedimentary tuffs are as a rule steeply\r\ninclined at angles of 20 to 40 degrees, the prevailing direction of the\r\ndip being to the north-east, its uniformity for such a length of coast\r\nbeing noteworthy. These beds however are occasionally “crumpled”; and\r\nhere and there a globular structure is developed.\r\n\r\nThe hills of this region of sedimentary tuffs between Na Tokalau and\r\nKiombo are the highest of the peninsula. They usually attain a height of\r\n400 feet, but do not reach 500 feet. From each of them descends to the\r\ncoast a spur terminating in a rocky point; whilst between these points\r\nlie low sandy flats, where the native villages of Levuka, Kiombo, &c.,\r\nare situated. The tuff-rocks extend to the top of the hills behind Na\r\nTokalau, and probably this will be found true of most of the other\r\nhills. Agglomerates are not common in the district. In the point west of\r\nNa Tokalau, however, they are overlaid by basaltic agglomerates, some of\r\nthe blocks being scoriaceous. In the point east of Levuka, a\r\nchocolate-coloured somewhat calcareous tuff-clay occurs interstratified\r\nin thin beds with the coarser deposits.\r\n\r\nThe general characters of these tuff-sandstones and tuff-clays have\r\nalready been briefly referred to. The former are much more prevalent and\r\nnon-calcareous; the latter are sometimes a little calcareous and look\r\nlike marl, and may perhaps contain a few tests of foraminifera. Both are\r\nformed of the debris of basic rocks and are more or less palagonitic.\r\nThe coarser deposits are described as sample A on page 330. At times\r\nthese tuffs are composed of much coarser fragments of the same\r\nmaterials, some of them a centimetre in size. A type of tuff\r\nintermediate in character is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe promontory that lies between Kiombo and Soni-soni Island has been\r\nformed by a remarkable basaltic flow. The low tongue, about 50 feet high\r\nand 200 to 300 yards across, in which it terminates, was originally\r\nsevered by a passage worn by the sea from the main portion; but it is\r\nnow joined by a low tract only 2 or 3 feet above the beach and partly\r\noccupied by mangroves.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the flow is well exhibited in the shore-flat and\r\ncoast-cliffs west of Kiombo, and extending to the end of the point. The\r\nwaves have here cut into its mass and exposed its structure. Its lower\r\npart, as exposed in the shore-flat, is made of a compact hemicrystalline\r\nbasalt; whilst its upper portion, as displayed in the cliffs, 30 or 35\r\nfeet in height, is composed of vitreous and semi-vitreous forms of the\r\nsame rock looking like pitchstone. The upper vitreous part is sometimes\r\nmassive; but usually it is rubbly, with a tendency to form spheroidal\r\nmasses. All transitions can there be traced between the hemicrystalline\r\nrock of the shore-flat and the vitreous rock of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe rock of the shore-flat, which has a specific gravity of 2·83, is a\r\nblackish porphyritic basalt with scanty olivine, and on account of the\r\nsemi-ophitic character of the augites of the groundmass it is placed in\r\ngenus 33 of the olivine class. The plagioclase phenocrysts are 3 to\r\n5 mm. in size. About half of the groundmass is made up of felspar-lathes\r\n(·17 mm. long) and large augites (·11 mm.), the rest consisting of a\r\nsmoky devitrified glass containing a few irregular “lacunæ” filled with\r\nthe residual magma in the form of a reddish-brown opaque palagonite-like\r\nmaterial. The rock intermediate between the lower and upper portions of\r\nthe flow is also intermediate in character, having a specific gravity of\r\n2·77, whilst quite three-fourths of the groundmass are of smoky glass.\r\n\r\nThe vitreous rocks of the cliffs, though usually rubbly in appearance,\r\nhave also the aspect in places of brecciated pitchstone tuffs with the\r\ninterstices filled with waxy palagonite; but the microscopical\r\nexamination shows that we have not to deal with a rock of detrital\r\norigin. We have here the effects of the breaking up and crushing _in\r\nsitu_ of a dark-brown isotropic basic glass[47] carrying porphyritic\r\nplagioclase. The interspaces then became partially filled with the finer\r\nfragments of the glass and of the crushed felspar; but they were in the\r\nmain occupied by a still liquid magma which penetrated into the cracks\r\nof the glass-fragments and into those of the felspars, where the\r\nfractured portions in some cases remained _in position_. There it has\r\nbecome devitrified and often palagonitised. Whether this liquid magma\r\nwas produced by a partial remelting resulting from the heat developed\r\nduring the crushing of the glassy upper portion of the flow during the\r\ncontracting process, or whether it was squeezed upwards from the less\r\nconsolidated lower portion, I cannot determine, although the last\r\nsupposition seems more probable. At all events the edges of the\r\nglass-fragments are peculiarly eroded as if by the magma. (The bearing\r\nof these facts on the origin of palagonite is discussed in Chapter\r\nXXIV.)\r\n\r\nI infer that this flow has descended from the hills west of Kiombo. Huge\r\nmasses of agglomerate are exposed in the lower third of the hill marked\r\n“470 feet” in the chart, and immediately north of the town. Fine clayey\r\ntuffs are exposed in the hill at the back and to the westward of this\r\nplace; but the locality requires a more detailed examination. The\r\nabsence to all appearance of vesicular and scoriaceous rocks in the case\r\nof this basaltic flow is remarkable. This would not have been expected\r\nin the case of a supra-marine flow; and indeed the testimony of the\r\ntuffs of this peninsula sufficiently indicates that during their\r\ndeposition the whole district was submerged.\r\n\r\nThe future inquirer will doubtless discover some old volcanic “necks” in\r\nthe hills of this peninsula. One such hill overlooks the Soni-soni inlet\r\nabout a mile west of Kiombo. It is a singular isolated hill which I have\r\nnamed Bare-poll Peak for descriptive purposes. In my notes its height is\r\nstated as 120 feet, but it appeared to me to be rather higher than this.\r\nIt is capped by two huge masses, 14 or 15 feet high, of a dark grey\r\nslightly scoriaceous augite-andesite with a cryptocrystalline\r\ngroundmass, which apparently form the uppermost portion of a volcanic\r\n“neck” or pipe. According to the size of these rock-masses the “neck”\r\nwould have a circumference of 80 or 90 feet. These masses are in part\r\nincrusted with agglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe adjacent island of Soni-soni, which is almost joined by the\r\nmangrove-belt to the adjoining coast, probably represents one of the\r\nnumerous small vents that were once active in this region. Its single\r\npeak is 460 feet in height. As there did not seem much prospect of\r\nfinding rocks exposed on its upper part, its slopes being densely\r\ncovered with tall reeds, my examination was confined to the lower\r\nportion during a walk around the island. On its east and north sides\r\noccur rocks of much the same character as those exposed in the\r\nneighbouring low promontory to the east of it. In addition to\r\nagglomerates and basaltic andesites occurred a rubbly pitchstone\r\ncomposed of fragments, up to a centimetre in size, of an opaque brown\r\nglass displaying a few phenocrysts of plagioclase and pyroxene, the\r\ninterstices being filled with crushed fragments of the phenocrysts and\r\nfiner glass debris. This rock is allied to the “crush-tuffs” described\r\non page 334. It may be added that the basic tuffs are more frequent on\r\nthe west and south sides of the island.\r\n\r\nThe low island of Na Vatu in the midst of the Soni-soni inlet is about\r\n250 feet across and only 3 or 4 feet above the ordinary high-tide level.\r\nIn 1898, when I visited it, this tiny island possessed about 20 houses\r\nand a population of 60 or 70 persons, and I gather from Hazlewood’s\r\naccount of these islands that Na Vatu was crowded with houses more than\r\nhalf a century ago. It was apparently in the first place a sand-key, and\r\nis protected against the wash of the waves by a low sea-wall formed of\r\nlarge blocks of stone.\r\n\r\nAn interesting exposure of bedded tuffs and clays is displayed at\r\nRavi-ravi on the west side of the peninsula. A broad shore-flat has been\r\nformed by the marine erosion of a line of coast composed of these\r\ndeposits. The strike is well exhibited, the dip being about 30 degrees\r\nN. by W. Here there are alternating beds, a few inches thick, of coarse\r\nand fine tufaceous sandstones, sometimes calcareous, with marls or\r\ncalcareous clays. The mineral fragments of the coarser rocks are\r\ncomposed of plagioclase, augite and rhombic pyroxene, the last being\r\nabundant and giving a more acid character to these deposits. The\r\ncalcareous fragments appear to be principally shell debris. The marl is\r\nin part composed of much finer detritus of the same minerals. The other\r\nmaterials of these deposits are derived from the degradation of basic\r\nandesitic rocks, and include also a little palagonite. To the westward\r\nof Ravi-ravi these beds show signs of disturbance, being steeply tilted\r\nto the N.W. Agglomerates also occur in the disturbed area.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Kumbulau peninsula is evidently the history of the\r\neruptive phases of a number of more or less submerged small vents and of\r\nthe periods of great marine erosion that followed during the emergence\r\nof this part of the island. The absence or rarity of dykes is\r\nremarkable; but most of the hills would represent volcanic “necks”\r\nwhether of massive rock, tuff, or agglomerate.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRICT BETWEEN THE KUMBULAU PENINSULA AND THE YANAWAI\r\nRIVER.—Between Nandi Inlet and the village of Rewa the sea-border is low\r\nand often swampy, whilst occasional spurs descend from the inland range\r\ninto the swamps without reaching the coast. Pebbles of “soapstone”\r\n(foraminiferous mud-rock) occur in streams and are no doubt derived from\r\nthe incrusting deposits of the neighbouring hill slopes. In one\r\nstream-bed in the swamps is exposed _in situ_ a remarkable\r\nchocolate-coloured rock that looks like a greasy pitchstone or a\r\npalagonite-rock. It is however of detrital origin, and is composed in\r\nmass of minute fragments of a basic, sometimes vacuolar, glass in great\r\npart converted into palagonite; whilst there are a number of broken\r\ncrystals of olivine and plagioclase. Through the palagonitic alteration\r\nthe fragmental character is somewhat obscured, zeolites being\r\nextensively developed in the interstices. A little lime occurs and there\r\nis a suspicion of foraminifera. The deposit belongs to the group of\r\npalagonite marls described on page 335. The deeper rocks of the district\r\nare represented in a spur by an altered augite-andesite, originally\r\nhemicrystalline and containing much granular epidote.\r\n\r\nProceeding northward from the village of Rewa, one crosses another spur\r\ndescending from the inland range. It is formed in mass of a dark\r\ndoleritic olivine-basalt (spec. grav. 2·91) characterised by the length\r\nof the felspar-lathes (·28 mm.), possessing a little interstitial glass,\r\nand referred to genus 25 of the olivine class. It probably represents an\r\nancient flow. Its surface is incrusted, as high as the road ascends,\r\nnearly 200 feet above the sea, by fine and coarse palagonite-tuffs;\r\nwhilst the pebbles of foraminiferous mud-rock in the stream indicate the\r\nexistence of incrusting marine deposits further up the slopes. The road\r\nthen leads down into a low-lying undulating district that forms the sea\r\nborder as far as the mouth of the Yanawai, and reaches about two miles\r\ninland without exceeding an elevation of 100 feet, although low hills\r\noccur here and there. This region is fronted by mangrove swamps and is\r\ntraversed by the Matasawalevu and Ndranimako streams. It is a district\r\nof basic tuffs and foraminiferous clays, which, as shown below, extend\r\nup the slopes of the basaltic Wainunu table-land that lies behind. The\r\nsoil in all the low country between Rewa and the Yanawai is red, heavy,\r\nwet, and clayey; and affords a contrast to the dry friable soil of the\r\nKumbulau and Kiombo region to the southward.\r\n\r\nThe Navakavura plain lying north of Rewa deserves especial mention. It\r\nis a low, swampy district which a mile inland is raised only 20 or 30\r\nfeet above the sea, and is mostly occupied by casuarina and pandanus\r\ntrees. Red argillaceous rocks, representing more or less decomposed\r\npalagonite coarse and fine tuffs, are exposed in the banks of the\r\nstreams. Some of them were originally made up of fragments of basic\r\nglass which after being palagonitised became much disintegrated. A\r\ntypical specimen by my side has a soapy feel and looks like a lump of\r\nred clay. Microscopical examination shows that it is composed in mass of\r\npalagonite, but in an extreme stage of the alteration process.\r\n\r\nAfter traversing the Navakavura plain, one crosses a low hill rather\r\nover 100 feet above the sea before descending to Ndranimako. On the hill\r\nare exposed reddish clay-rocks, much weathered, but showing vegetable\r\nremains and a few univalve and bivalve shells. Extensive submarine\r\ndeposits occur in the inland district west of Ndranimako. They are the\r\nusual foraminiferous clay-rocks or “soapstones,” and in places they\r\ncontain pteropod shells. They are well displayed in river-banks, and in\r\nthe hill-slopes on either side; but they are probably of no great\r\nthickness since in one locality named Na Savu, nearly two miles west of\r\nNdranimako, the underlying basaltic rock is exposed in the bed of a\r\ngully, the sides being of “soapstone.” These deposits were formed in\r\ncomparatively deep water.[48] The greatest elevation at which they were\r\nobserved was about 100 feet; but this was as high as I reached in the\r\nascent of the river. According to the natives, who are very observant in\r\nsuch matters, these submarine deposits extend up the slopes of the\r\nadjacent Wainunu plateau. On page 86 reference is made to their\r\noccurrence on the slopes of this basaltic table-land, 1½ or 2 miles\r\nfarther north.\r\n\r\nIn the district between the Ndranimako and the Yanawai rivers basic\r\ntuffs and “soapstone” prevail. In this locality, and especially in the\r\nvicinity of Ndranimako, siliceous concretions 2 to 3 inches across,\r\noccur in places on the surface. Their nature is described in Chapter\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing remarks it may be inferred that the sea-border\r\nbetween the Kumbulau Peninsula and the Yanawai River is formed of\r\nsubmarine deposits overlying basic rocks which probably represent\r\nancient flows. Some of the deposits are largely formed of glassy erupted\r\nmaterials, which have been converted into palagonite. Others again are\r\nmore characteristic sedimentary formations accumulated in relatively\r\ndeep water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE NDRANDRAMEA DISTRICT\r\n\r\nTHIS hilly region of acid andesites is a continuation of the mountainous\r\nbackbone of the island, being separated from the basaltic mountain of\r\nSeatura by the saddle formed by the Na Savu table-land. These acid\r\nandesites exhibit in nearly all cases a felsitic groundmass and\r\nphenocrysts of plagioclase and rhombic pyroxene; whilst many of them are\r\ncharacterised by brown hornblende more or less pseudomorphosed in the\r\nmanner described on page 306, and a few display porphyritic quartz.\r\nAlthough these rocks have a common facies, they vary considerably among\r\nthemselves; and it is difficult to find a term that would strictly\r\ninclude them all. A general description of their characters is given in\r\nthe chapter on the Acid Andesites.\r\n\r\nIn this interesting region a number of hills or mountains formed in mass\r\nof acid andesites rise up abruptly without any regular arrangement\r\nwithin an area measuring 5 by 6 miles, and elevated 600 to 1,000 feet\r\nabove the sea. Of these hills, thirteen in all, nine range in height\r\nbetween 1,600 and 2,500 feet above the sea, none of the others rising\r\nless than 1,000 feet above that level. But the actual height of each\r\nhill above the country at its base is much less than this. The height of\r\nthe hill-mass, in five or six of the largest, ranges between 900 and\r\n1,200 feet, whilst in the smaller hills it varies between 400 and 800\r\nfeet. (See accompanying plan.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The NDRANDRAMEA District from the westward. The hills and\r\nmountains are of acid andesites and dacites. The foreground is elevated\r\nabout 450 feet above the sea.]\r\n\r\n                                                          [_Face p. 98._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rough plan of the Ndrandramea district in Vanua Levu;\r\nmade with prismatic compass and aneroid by H. B. Guppy.]\r\n\r\nThese hills have sometimes a rounded profile, when their summits are\r\nusually wooded. Others again terminate in conical bare rocky peaks,\r\neither pointed or truncated. They have often precipitous slopes and\r\ndisplay vertical cliff-faces high up their sides. Their arrangement is\r\nrather singular. To the south and apart from the others lies Soloa Levu\r\n(1,600 feet). Navuningumu (1,930 feet) is similarly isolated on the\r\nnorth. On the east rises Ngaingai (2,430 feet), the highest of the\r\npeaks, with Wawa Levu (2,000 feet), Vatu Kerimasi (1,900 feet), Vatu\r\nVanaya (1,600 feet), and Mbona Lailai (2,100 feet) closely clustered by\r\nits side. On the west there is another group of hills, of which\r\nNdrandramea (1,800 feet) is the highest and best known. Associated with\r\nit are Kala-Kala (1,600 feet), Mako-mako, Thoka-singa (1,300 feet), Vatu\r\nMata (1,050 feet), and another unnamed peak (1,400 feet) lying west of\r\nNdrandramea.\r\n\r\nThe districts between and among the hills are much cut up into lesser\r\nhills and ridges, the result of the very extensive denudation to which\r\nthis region has been subjected. The greater part of this area is drained\r\nby the Tambu-lotu tributary of the Wainunu; but in the northern part we\r\ncross the watershed between the Wainunu and Ndreketi basins, and to\r\nreach Navuningumu we cross the valley of one of the tributaries of the\r\nNdreketi. To the east of the Ndrandramea region extends a broken\r\ncountry, elevated rather more than 1,000 feet above the sea, and from it\r\nthere rise one or two hills with bare cliff-faces, which are probably\r\ncomposed of similar acid andesites.\r\n\r\nAlthough for the most part composed of these acid andesites, each hill,\r\nas far as my observations show, has as a rule its own type of the rock,\r\ndiffering from the others in specific weight, in the texture of the\r\ngroundmass, and in the relative proportion of the porphyritic\r\nconstituents. The petrological characters will be found more fully\r\ndiscussed in Chapter XXI.; and only some of the more distinctive\r\nfeatures will be noticed here in the following description of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nTHE NGAINGAI GROUP OF HILLS.—Within a space less than a mile square rise\r\nNgaingai, Wawa Levu, and the other three hills above named, so closely\r\nclustered together that the collective name of “Hen and Chickens” might\r\nbe aptly applied to the group.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar form of Ngaingai is shown in the accompanying\r\nprofile-sketch. It is the Nangorongoro of the Admiralty chart. The\r\nheight of the mountain from its base is 1,100 to 1,200 feet. Its ascent,\r\nwhich is not difficult, may be made from the west side. Above its wooded\r\nslopes rises its bare rocky peak, from which a magnificent panoramic\r\nview of the western half of Vanua Levu can be obtained. Characteristic\r\ndacites with porphyritic quartz came under my notice all the way up from\r\nthe foot to the summit, being occasionally exposed in perpendicular\r\ncliff-faces. Specimens taken from the upper and lower portions are\r\nuniform in character, and have a specific gravity of 2·57. No other\r\nrocks were observed on its slopes. The whole hill-mass is in great part\r\nif not entirely formed of these acid andesites.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the narrow crested peak of Ngaingai and the\r\ndome-shaped summit of Wawa Levu is seen in the sketch; and this is the\r\nmore remarkable because it is not associated, as far as I could\r\nascertain, with any important difference in geological character. Wawa\r\nLevu rises precipitously to a height of 900 or 1,000 feet above its\r\nbase, and displays often perpendicular cliff-faces on its sides. Its\r\nbroad level soil-covered summit is mostly covered with young wood, few\r\nof the trees having trunks more than 4 inches in diameter, whilst they\r\nare usually clothed with damp moss, and are often decayed and\r\nrotten.[49] True dacites, closely similar to those of the neighbouring\r\nNgaingai and having a specific gravity of 2·61, were displayed often in\r\nslab-like blocks from the base to near the top. The rudely columnar\r\nstructure to be observed in some of the other hills is rarely exhibited.\r\nNo other rocks came under my notice. The remains of the stone walls of\r\ntwo old “war-towns,” one of them named “Ndaku-i-tonga,” occur on its\r\nsouth and south-east slopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profiles of Ngaingai and Wawa Levu from Nambuna to the\r\nsouth-west. Both are dacitic mountains.]\r\n\r\nThe other three hills of the Ngaingai group were not ascended by me.\r\nThey show the same bare cliff-faces and have to all appearance the same\r\ngeological character. Mbona Lailai and Vatu Kerimasi are two\r\nblunt-topped conical hills with precipitous slopes that rise\r\nrespectively about 900 and 700 feet above the country at their base.\r\nVatu Vanaya, about 500 feet in height, has a rounded summit.\r\n\r\nTHE NDRANDRAMEA GROUP OF HILLS.—A view of these hills from the westward\r\nis given in the accompanying illustration. They have a lower elevation\r\nthan the hills of the Ngaingai group, none of them rising to over 1,800\r\nfeet above the sea, whilst their height from the base is also less,\r\nranging between 400 and 900 feet. They rise, as the illustration shows,\r\nin the midst of a densely-wooded broken country.\r\n\r\nNdrandramea, which is 1,800 feet above the sea, has an individual height\r\nof about 900 feet. Fijians in distant parts of the island are familiar\r\nwith the name of this remarkable peak. It has a legendary fame; and like\r\nWawa Levu in the old time it served as a mountain stronghold in times of\r\nwar. The remains of a stonewall of a “koro-ni-valu” or “town of war,”\r\nknown as Mata-mei-ndami-ndami, occur on its side, 300 or 350 feet below\r\nits summit; whilst among the wild lemon trees that cover the slopes\r\nbelow large ovoid sling-stones 4 or 5 inches in length may still be\r\nfound. Viewed from the south-east, as shown in the frontispiece,\r\nNdrandramea has the shape of a woman’s breast; and evidently the origin\r\nof its name is connected with this resemblance. But seen from the west\r\nand south-west, as in the other general view of the district (page 98),\r\nit has a broadly truncated conical outline, its form being indeed\r\nsomewhat elongated or elliptical.\r\n\r\nThis hill presents precipitous slopes, and on the south side it shows\r\nbare rocky faces. As seen in the illustration, it might appear\r\ninaccessible; but the ascent is not difficult on the west side. It is\r\ncomposed in mass of an acid andesite allied to the dacites of Ngaingai\r\nand Wawa Levu, but differing in the hemicrystalline character of the\r\ngroundmass (except at the base), in the porphyritic development of\r\nrhombic pyroxene, and in the absence of porphyritic quartz. As remarked\r\non page 301, the rock becomes more basic as one descends the hill. At\r\nthe top its specific weight is 2·44, about 300 feet below it is 2·58, at\r\n700 feet from the top it is 2·68, and at the base of the hill where it\r\nis holocrystalline and has a dioritic appearance it is 2·71. That it\r\npossesses a rudely columnar structure is shown by the occurrence here\r\nand there on the slopes and at the base of the hill of portions of\r\nprostrate columns, 3 to 4 feet broad and sometimes 20 to 25 feet long,\r\nwhich have a rounded surface and look like fossil tree-trunks. Masses of\r\nagglomerate of the same andesitic rocks lie about in places on the lower\r\nslopes, the included blocks, which are a few inches across, being\r\nsometimes rounded.\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring hills lying south and west of Ndrandramea are, as far\r\nas my observations show, of the same acid type of andesite. It is\r\nconnected with those nearest by a saddle, 1,100 feet above the sea,\r\nwhere the same holocrystalline form of the rock occurs, having a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·7 and being often rudely columnar in structure.\r\nKala-kala, about 1,600 feet above the sea, is an imposing-looking hill\r\nwith perpendicular cliff-faces on some of its sides. I did not ascend\r\nit, but found at its base a rock of the same andesitic type, differing\r\nfrom that of Ndrandramea in the more crystalline character of the\r\ngroundmass, and having a specific gravity of 2·61. West of Kala-kala is\r\nthe outlying hill of Vatu Mata with a flat top and rising only about 400\r\nfeet from its base. It has all the appearance of being composed of the\r\nsame andesitic rocks. It is shown on the left-hand in the illustration.\r\n\r\nLying south of Kala-kala are the two peaks of Mako-mako and Thoka-singa,\r\nrising respectively 1,400 and 1,300 feet above the sea. I ascended the\r\nlast-named, which has a rounded summit covered with trees. Approaching\r\nit from Nambuna on the east, I found at its foot a large mass of\r\npitchstone-agglomerate, formed of fragments of vitreous basic rocks,\r\nsuch as occurs around the lower part of Soloa Levu on the other side of\r\nthe valley. The slopes of Thoka-singa, between 200 and 450 feet below\r\nthe summit, are strewn with masses of another kind of agglomerate made\r\nup of blocks 3 to 8 inches across, occasionally rounded, and composed of\r\nthe same felsitic andesite, of which the mass of the hill is formed.\r\nThis last-named rock is exposed in bulk in the upper part, but on the\r\nsummit the agglomerate reappears. It has a granitoid appearance, and is\r\ndistinguished from the acid andesites of the other hills of the\r\nNdrandramea district by its greater specific gravity (2·72 to 2·74), by\r\nits holocrystalline texture, and by the coarse grain of the mosaic of\r\nits felsitic groundmass, which is probably quartz-bearing but is\r\nrelatively scanty. It is, however, referable to the same group of\r\nfelsitic andesites, but is to be placed at the basic end of the series.\r\n(Its description is given on page 302.) In Thoka-singa we have therefore\r\na hill which is evidently formed in mass of these holocrystalline\r\nfelsitic andesites but covered in places with an agglomerate of the same\r\nmaterials. I have already referred to this feature in the structure of\r\nNdrandramea. Since the blocks are sometimes rounded, such agglomerates\r\nmay represent the result of marine erosion during the emergence of this\r\npart of the island. In the case of Navuningumu, where they lie abruptly\r\non calcareous clays containing tests of foraminifera and shells of\r\npteropods, a different explanation appears to be needed.\r\n\r\nTHE HILL OF SOLOA LEVU.—This isolated hill, which presents another type\r\nof these acid andesites, has a broad rounded summit; and though elevated\r\nabout 1,600 feet above the sea, the hill itself rises only 800 or 900\r\nfeet above the country at its base. It is not easy to obtain a view of\r\nthe profile of this hill and to ascertain its relation to its\r\nsurroundings; and it was only when I viewed it from near the top of Vatu\r\nKaisia six miles to the eastward that I was able to understand its\r\nposition. Looking from that standpoint across the basaltic table-land of\r\nWainunu one observed Soloa Levu rising as a dome-shaped hill at the\r\nwestern margin of the table-land and apparently not separated from it.\r\nThe examination of the district shows that on the east and south-east\r\nsides this hill was in part surrounded by the great basaltic flows by\r\nwhich the table-land was built up. Basic tuffs and agglomerates,\r\nhowever, occur on the lower slopes on the north-west, west, and\r\nsouth-west sides, so that Soloa Levu in fact lies in the midst of an\r\narea of basic rocks.\r\n\r\nThe type of acid andesite which is displayed in the upper two-thirds of\r\nthe hill is distinguished from those of the other hills of the\r\nNdrandramea district by its orthophyric groundmass. Instead of a fine\r\nmosaic, the matrix displays as a rule an arrangement of short stout\r\nplagioclase prisms; but in one of my slides the two forms of groundmass\r\nare associated. In their general characters as described on page 296,\r\nthey cannot be separated from the acid andesites of the Ndrandramea\r\ndistrict. Their specific weight ranges between 2·54 and 2·62, and like\r\nmost of the other acid andesites they contain little, if any,\r\ninterstitial glass. Huge blocks of these rocks lie about on the slopes,\r\noften assuming a columnar form, the fragments of such columns being\r\nsometimes 5 or 6 feet in diameter, and 12 to 15 feet in length. I found\r\none such block standing erect like a solitary obelisk.\r\n\r\nThe best way to observe the basic rocks that invest the lower slopes of\r\nSoloa Levu is to follow the track that skirts it on the south side on\r\nthe way from Tambu-lotu to Vunivuvundi. Palagonitic tuffs containing in\r\nplaces a little lime[50] and composed of fragments of basic glass of\r\nvarying size and more or less palagonitised extend from Tambu-lotu and\r\nNuku-ni-tambua (two villages lying about a mile to the westward) to the\r\nwest and south-west slopes of Soloa Levu. A pitchstone-agglomerate,\r\nformed of fragments of a basic glass inclosing large crystals of\r\nplagioclase felspar one-third of an inch in length, is associated with\r\nthese tuffs on the lower north-west, west, and south-west slopes of the\r\nhill. The tuffs are formed of the same materials as the\r\npitchstone-agglomerates, but differ in their character of being more or\r\nless palagonitised. However, on the north-west side the latter have also\r\nundergone this change. On page 312 will be found a description of the\r\nbasic glass of these agglomerates in its fresh and in its altered\r\ncondition. Huge blocks of these rocks strew the surface on the\r\nsouth-west slopes of Soloa Levu, and in one place the underlying acid\r\nandesite that forms the mass of the hill is exposed in a stream-course.\r\n\r\nThese pitchstone-agglomerates and palagonitic pitchstone-tuffs are\r\nelevated between 600 and 750 feet above the sea. As one proceeds on the\r\nroad to Vunivuvundi and skirts the south-east side of the hill one\r\nascends the western border of the basaltic Wainunu table-land which,\r\nhowever, is much cut up by rivers in this locality. Here the tuffs and\r\nagglomerates give place to a basaltic andesite, and on reaching an\r\nelevation of 1,000 feet we arrive at the top of the table-land from\r\nwhich an ascent of Soloa Levu is easily made. The road then lies on, but\r\nparallel to, the border of this plateau for some distance until it\r\ndescends into a deep valley worn by one of the tributaries of the\r\nWainunu River.\r\n\r\nThis hill of Soloa Levu is in fact a mass of acid andesite situated in\r\nthe midst of an area of basic rocks. I found basaltic rocks exposed in\r\nthe stream courses to the north and similar rocks prevail on the\r\nnorth-west on the way between Nambuna and Tambu-lotu. It has been above\r\nremarked that on the east and south it has been in part surrounded by\r\nthe basaltic flows of the Wainunu table-land, and that pitchstone-tuffs\r\nand agglomerates cover its lower slopes on the west and south-west, yet\r\nit is not easy to find any trace of the vent from which they flowed or\r\nwere ejected.\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked that the occurrence here and there of basic\r\nrocks in the midst of this region suggests the vicinity of dykes. For\r\ninstance, in a deep gulley about half a mile south-west of Kalakala,\r\nwhere a dacitic rock was exposed _in situ_, I came upon a single large\r\nmass of an aphanitic augite-andesite of the type described under genus\r\n16, species A, of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nTHE ALTERED ACID ANDESITES OF THE NDRANDRAMEA DISTRICT.—One of the most\r\nimportant features of the geological structure of this district lies in\r\nthe fact that the bed-rock exposed in the lower region between the hills\r\nis a highly altered acid andesite of the type found in the hills around.\r\nBy referring to the map of this locality, it will be observed that\r\nbetween the Ndrandramea hills on the west and the Ngaingai hills on the\r\neast is the valley of the Tambu-lotu river and its tributaries, an open\r\nbroken country deeply eroded by the streams, and elevated 600 to 700\r\nfeet above the sea. These altered rocks are well exposed in the deep\r\ngorge-like channel of the river between the village of Nambuna and the\r\nfoot of Ndrandramea, and in fact in all places in this district where\r\nthe streams have worn deeply into the surface.\r\n\r\nThey have a coarse felsitic groundmass, and are described under the\r\nfelsitic order of the hypersthene-andesites on page 297. They present\r\nall degrees of change from the hard dark grey mottled rocks, in which\r\nthe phenocrysts of plagioclase and rhombic pyroxene are in part replaced\r\nby calcitic, viriditic, and chloritic materials, to those where the\r\npseudomorphism and alteration is complete, when the decomposition\r\nproducts give their character to a pale yellowish rock, which sparkles\r\nwith pyrites and often effervesces briskly with an acid. After this\r\ncomes the final stage of disintegration, and we get a whitish rotten\r\nstone, often full of pyrites, the last condition of which is shown in a\r\nkaolin-like material exposed in the river-side.\r\n\r\nThe extensive alteration of these rocks is also indicated by the\r\noccurrence amongst the gravel of the river-bed and small stream courses\r\nnear Nambuna of fragments of clear quartz prisms, half an inch across,\r\nand of nodules, three inches in size and sometimes hollow in the centre,\r\nformed of radiating quartz crystals that once filled cavities in the\r\naltered rock. Small masses of vein-quartz also occur in these streams,\r\nformed in a fissure by the growth of the crystals from the sides towards\r\nthe centre. I was unable to find the source of the quartz; but it is\r\nprobable that it was produced near the line of contact between the\r\nbasaltic flows to the eastward and the older felsitic rocks of the\r\ndistrict. The great alteration of the acid andesitic rocks exposed as\r\nthe bed-rocks in this region may in all probability be attributed to the\r\nvicinity of these basaltic rocks. The two formations apparently come\r\ninto contact about a mile east of Nambuna. In traversing this district\r\non the road to Ndrawa one first observes _in situ_ in the streams the\r\ndecomposed felsitic bed-rock with occasional loose blocks of a\r\nquartzitic rock that displays in the thin section a mosaic of irregular\r\ngrains of quartz. Afterwards, as one rises gradually to the top of the\r\nbasaltic plateau, basaltic rocks are alone exposed in position.\r\n\r\nIn the character of the fine river sand a clue may be found to the exact\r\nlocality of the contact. In the midst of the andesitic area between\r\nNambuna and Ndrandramea, the sand, besides containing much magnetic\r\niron, is also composed to a large extent of rhombic pyroxene prisms,\r\nclear quartz grains, and fragments of plagioclase, all derived from the\r\nporphyritic crystals of the dacites, &c. Near the basaltic district we\r\nfind that the quartz and rhombic pyroxene have disappeared, the sand\r\nbeing largely made up of magnetic-iron grains mixed with fragments of\r\nplagioclase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profile and Geological Section of Vanua Levu, across the\r\nisland from the Sarawanga (north) coast to the Yanawai (south) coast.]\r\n\r\nTHE EXTENT OF THE AREA OF ACID ANDESITE ROCKS IN THE NDRANDRAMEA\r\nDISTRICT.—By referring to the map of this locality it will be observed\r\nthat this region of andesites extends northward to the Navuningumu\r\nRange, and that on the south it would be separated from the district of\r\ntuffs and agglomerates, named the table-land of Na Savu, by a line\r\njoining the hills of Soloa Levu and Thokasinga. On the east it is\r\nbounded by the basaltic area of the Wainunu table-land. On the west it\r\nextends at the surface, with an occasional overlying patch of submarine\r\ntuffs and clays, for a distance of at least two or three miles from the\r\nbase of the hills, and sometimes, as in the direction of Sarawanga, more\r\nthan half way to the coast. I have endeavoured to show the relation of\r\nthese acid rocks to the basalts and to the sedimentary deposits in the\r\ngeological section.\r\n\r\nWhen taking the track from Sarawanga to Nambuna by way of Ndrandramea\r\none soon enters the region of these acid andesites. The prevailing rock\r\nexposed on the surface, where it is usually much decomposed, is a\r\nbluish-grey hypersthene-andesite with a specific gravity of 2·54, and\r\ndisplaying in a cryptocrystalline groundmass, where the felsitic texture\r\ncan be recognised, abundant phenocrysts of plagioclase and rhombic\r\npyroxene. As high as 500 feet above the sea it is occasionally capped by\r\npatches of palagonitised clays and tuffs scantily foraminiferous, and at\r\none place I noticed a patch of agglomerate, the subangular blocks six to\r\neight inches across being formed of the same acid andesite. In the same\r\nway by taking the road from Tembe-ni-ndio to Nambuna, passing the hill\r\nof Kala-kala on the way, we leave behind the foraminiferous tuffs and\r\nlimestones of the lower coast regions; and when about 400 feet above the\r\nsea we enter the inland district of felsitic andesites which begin about\r\ntwo miles from Tembe-ni-ndio.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVUNINGUMU RANGE.—By following the track from Nambuna to\r\nNavuningumu one skirts the bases of Wawa Levu and Ngaingai, where\r\ndacitic rocks are exposed. After passing the watershed[51] between the\r\nWainunu and Ndreketi rivers, the track descends into the deep valley of\r\none of the western tributaries of the Ndreketi, where a characteristic\r\nholocrystalline type of these felsitic andesites is exposed. Approaching\r\nNavuningumu one finds exposed at its base agglomerates, composed of\r\nscoriaceous and amygdaloidal semi-vitreous basic rocks, overlying a dark\r\ntufaceous sandstone which on examination proves to be a basic pumiceous\r\ntuff of the type described on page 333, and scantily foraminiferous.\r\n\r\nWe stand now in a region of basic rocks on the south-east side of the\r\nrange, and before us rises abruptly the weird-looking magnetic peak of\r\nNavuningumu, which is well represented in the accompanying illustration.\r\nIn the wet season its summit is usually enveloped in the thunder-clouds.\r\nIts elevation above the sea is 1,930 feet, but estimated from its base\r\nits height is 1,000 to 1,100 feet. The natives also name this peak Na\r\nSeyanga, after a town that once existed in this locality. It is the\r\nsummit of a range that extends a mile or more to the north where it\r\nterminates in a lesser peak known as Mumu.\r\n\r\nAscending the peak of Navuningumu from the south-east one finds\r\nexposed in its lower part, up to 1,200 feet above the sea,\r\npitchstone-agglomerates (composed of fragments of a vitreous basic\r\nrock) and white tufaceous sandstones (containing a few tests of\r\nforaminifera), such as are described below in the case of the\r\nneighbouring Mbenutha Cliffs. Between 1,300 and 1,500 feet there is\r\ndisplayed in position a typical dacite of the type described on page\r\n303.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MT. TAVIA (2,210 feet) from VATU KAISIA. It is probably\r\nformed of an acid andesite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The magnetic peak of NAVUNINGUMU (1,931 feet) from the\r\nsouth. The summit represents a basaltic neck.]\r\n\r\n                                                         [_Face p. 108._\r\n\r\nThe peak itself is formed of a dark-brown slightly vesicular\r\nsemi-vitreous basaltic andesite, of which, in fact, for the upper 200\r\nfeet, the summit is composed. The rock is somewhat rubbly; and where it\r\nis exposed on the bare peak it is powerfully magnetic, displaying\r\npolarity in a marked degree, and rendering the compass useless (see page\r\n368). A specimen of the magnetic rock, which is a little vesicular, has\r\na specific gravity of 2·82. It is referred to genus 1 of the\r\naugite-andesites described on page 267. It displays in the slide\r\nporphyritic plagioclase, with a little augite, in a groundmass formed of\r\na plexus of minute felspar-lathes (·06 mm. in length), and exhibiting a\r\nlarge amount of a brown opaque glass in which grains and rods of\r\nmagnetite with a few pyroxene granules are developed. The magnetite in\r\nthe groundmass, although abundant, is not in greater quantity than is\r\nusually found in semi-vitreous basaltic rocks without polarity.... This\r\nterminal mass of basic lava-rock evidently forms the “plug” of a\r\nvolcanic pipe that pierces the acid andesitic rocks of the district; and\r\nfrom this ancient vent were doubtless ejected the basic tuffs and\r\nagglomerates that now cover the lower slopes of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which this volcano displayed its activity are\r\nfurther illustrated in a remarkable section exhibited on the east side\r\nof the mountain half a mile or more north of the summit. Here there is a\r\nline of bold cliffs, in which, as shown in the illustration, a bed of\r\nagglomerate, 60 or 70 feet thick, overlies a series of foraminiferous\r\nclays and tufaceous sandstones, which are elevated about 1,100 feet\r\nabove the sea. The locality is named “Mbenu-tha” or “Rubbish-heap.” It\r\nis well known to the natives on account of its caves, which serve as a\r\nhalf-way resting-place on the road from Nambuna to Ndreketi. These caves\r\nhave been produced by the more rapid weathering of the underlying clays\r\nand sandstones. The line of cliff extends northward to Mumu, the peak at\r\nthat end of the range, and preserves there the same structure. The clays\r\nand tuff-sandstones are more or less stratified, and dip generally to\r\nthe west or south-west at an angle perhaps of 20 degrees; but in more\r\nthan one place they show signs of great disturbance, being contorted and\r\nsteeply tilted.\r\n\r\nThe foraminiferous clays form a more or less compact rock and contain 15\r\nor 16 per cent. of lime. They inclose pteropod shells in places and show\r\nmany minute foraminiferous tests of the pelagic type. Their composition\r\nis given on page 323; but it may be here remarked that the residue is\r\nmade up mainly of palagonitic debris, fine clayey material and minerals.\r\nThe mineral fragments form about 20 per cent. of the mass, and consist\r\nprincipally of glassy plagioclase, with some rhombic pyroxene, and\r\nmagnetite, their size averaging ·1 mm. The tuff-sandstones\r\ninterstratified with the clays contain only 2 or 3 per cent. of lime,\r\nand show only a few scattered microscopic tests of foraminifera. About\r\ntwo-thirds of the rock consist of fragments of a bottle green basic\r\nglass, vacuolar and but little altered, the rest being composed chiefly\r\nof glass debris, plagioclase, and a little pyroxene, the larger mineral\r\nand glass fragments averaging ·3 to ·5 mm. in size. They are in fact\r\nsubmarine hyalomelane tuffs very similar to those first met with at the\r\nfoot of the mountain, which are referred to on page 108. (They are\r\ndescribed on page 333.)\r\n\r\nThese interbedded clays and tufaceous sandstones of the Mbenu-tha cliffs\r\nwere deposited under somewhat different conditions. The clays represent\r\nthe quiet deposition in fairly deep water of fine materials derived from\r\nthe degradation of acid andesites as well as of basic rocks. The\r\nhyalomelane tuff-sandstones were formed more rapidly by the accumulation\r\nof fine volcanic ash consisting of fragments of a basic glass ejected\r\nfrom some neighbouring volcano that rose above the sea-surface.\r\n\r\nSubmarine hyalomelane-tuffs with basic agglomerates appear to be of\r\ncommon occurrence around the base of the Navuningumu mountain. As we\r\nleave the range behind and begin to descend the long spur that slopes\r\nnorthward to Ndreketi, we find for the first mile or two these\r\nagglomerates. But where the deeper rocks are exposed at an elevation of\r\n600 feet, near the village of Singa-singa, there are displayed fine\r\nbasic pumiceous tuffs and compact palagonitised clays containing little\r\nif any lime, the last, however, containing a few casts of microscopic\r\nforaminifera. The tuff is made up of minute fragments, the largest less\r\nthan ·1 mm. in size, of a basic hyalomelane glass, which is vacuolar,\r\nand often fibrillar like ordinary pumice, and in places shows the early\r\nstage of alteration into palagonite. The clay principally consists of\r\nmore or less palagonitised debris of the same basic glass, together with\r\nminute fragments of plagioclase and rhombic pyroxene. These tuffs and\r\nclays represent the two conditions of deposition above referred to, the\r\nlast indicating a period of quiescence when the fine materials resulting\r\nfrom the degradation of both acid and basic andesites were slowly\r\naccumulating in deep water, the first denoting the activity of a\r\nneighbouring supra-marine vent from which fine dust and ash formed of\r\nbasic pumice were ejected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MBENUTHA Cliffs showing volcanic agglomerates overlying\r\ntuffs and clays, containing shells of pteropods and foraminifera, which\r\nare raised 1,100 feet above the sea.]\r\n\r\n                                                         [_Face p. 111._\r\n\r\nThe bed of agglomerate, 60 to 70 feet thick, which overlies the\r\nforaminiferous tuffs and clays exposed in the line of cliff extending\r\nfrom Mbenu-tha to Mumu, is made up of subangular blocks, not usually\r\nover 6 inches in diameter, of an acid andesite of the general type found\r\nin the Ndrandramea region, but possessing a semi-vitreous\r\ngroundmass.[52] By clambering up the steep slope on the south side of\r\nthese cliffs, it will be observed that this thick bed of agglomerate is\r\ncovered by bedded foraminiferous clays and tuffs similar to those that\r\nunderlie it. It is therefore without doubt submarine, and presents the\r\nresult of the more violent outbursts of some neighbouring vent. That\r\nthis vent is now represented by the “plug” of basic lava forming the\r\npeak of Navuningumu is highly probable. It is, however, noteworthy that\r\nthese beds of agglomerates, tuffs, and clays, as shown in the photograph\r\nof the cliffs, are all inclined at an angle of 20° towards the axis of\r\neruption or to the westward. The tuffs and clays underlying the\r\nagglomerates are, as already remarked, much disturbed in places. It\r\nwould seem that all the beds here exposed were originally horizontal,\r\nand were tilted up during the disturbances accompanying the outbursts of\r\nvolcanic activity.\r\n\r\nThe natural section, which the Mbenu-tha cliffs present, is doubtless\r\ndue to landslips. Similar exposures, displayed by cliffs of basic\r\nagglomerate with submarine tuffs and clays at their base, are common on\r\nthe mountain-slopes of other parts of the island. Water oozes through\r\nthe underlying soft deposits, and the result is seen in the occurrence\r\nof huge masses of agglomerate on the slopes below.\r\n\r\nFrom the details here given respecting Navuningumu and its surroundings,\r\nit is apparent that there have been two stages in the history of this\r\nvolcanic mountain. The first was submarine and was characterised by the\r\ndischarge of acid lavas which consolidated around the vent and were\r\nafterwards covered over with deposits of foraminiferous clays. The\r\nsecond was in the last part supra-marine. With the renewal of activity,\r\nthe overlying acid andesites were broken through and basic materials\r\nwere discharged from the new vent. The bed of acid agglomerates exposed\r\nin the Mbenu-tha cliff belongs to that period of the second stage when\r\nthe explosive agencies were most violent. It represents the extensive\r\ndestruction of the overlying rocks. The foraminiferous tuff-sandstones\r\nare submarine accumulations of the finely comminuted fragments of basic\r\npumice that constituted the dust and fine ash discharged from a\r\nsupra-marine vent. The scoriaceous and amygdaloidal blocks of the basic\r\nagglomerates overlying these tuffs around the base of the mountain have\r\nhad a similar origin. The original ash-cone that at one time rose above\r\nthe surface of the sea has long since been destroyed by the denuding\r\nagencies; and its situation is alone indicated by the “neck” of basic\r\nlava-rock that forms the peak of Navuningumu.\r\n\r\nA very long period must have elapsed since this last stage in the\r\nactivity of the vent. The clays containing pteropod-shells and tests of\r\nforaminifera, with which the basic pumice tuffs and the acid\r\nagglomerates were interstratified, are now about 1,100 feet above the\r\nsea, and are situated in the centre of the island. During the emergence\r\nthe denudation of the new land-surface was no doubt very great; and\r\nthese submarine clays and tuffs, as displayed in the cliffs, owe their\r\npreservation in great part to the protection of the overlying mass of\r\nagglomerate.\r\n\r\nMuch light is thrown on the history of the whole Ndrandramea region of\r\nacid andesites by the examination of this old volcano of Navuningumu.\r\nSome of the hills, as in the case of Ngaingai and Wawa Levu, seem to\r\nhave been stripped of everything that could give information to the\r\ngeologist. Others again, like those of Thoka-singa and Ndrandramea,\r\ndisplay here and there on their slopes agglomerates of the same\r\nmaterials, the rounded forms of some of the blocks being in part\r\nindicative of marine erosion during the emergence of this region from\r\nthe sea. In Soloa Levu, however, we have one of these hills partially\r\nsurrounded by later basaltic flows and covered in places on its lower\r\nslopes by basic tuffs and agglomerates, probably submarine. In\r\nNavuningumu the original mass of acid andesite is only scantily exposed.\r\nIt is for the most part buried beneath submarine clays which are in\r\ntheir turn covered by the tuffs and agglomerates of later basic\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MOUNT VATU KAISIA AND DISTRICT\r\n\r\nTHIS peak, 1,880 feet in height, starts up suddenly in the mountainous\r\ninterior of the island. Being situated in the valley of the Yanawai\r\nriver, which opens to the south, it forms a conspicuous landmark for\r\nvessels off the south coast; but from most other points of view, on\r\naccount of its peculiar situation, it is usually difficult and often\r\nimpossible to obtain even a glimpse of it.[53] From its remarkable\r\nblunt-topped conical shape it has received the not very appropriate name\r\nof Marling Spike in the Admiralty charts. The natives name it Vatu\r\nKaisia, the first word signifying “rock,” whilst the second is the name\r\nof a demon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profile-sketch of the Vatu Kaisia district from S.S.E.]\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of its situation and of the character of the\r\nneighbouring country from the profile-sketch and photograph here\r\nproduced. I was unable for reasons given below to take a photograph of\r\nthe mountain itself, as it was either too near or too far away. Vatu\r\nKaisia is approached either from Ndrawa on the north or from Ndawara on\r\nthe south, the ascent being best made from the west side. The regions\r\ntraversed on the way are so densely wooded that the mountain does not\r\nbecome visible until the traveller is right upon it. He becomes suddenly\r\naware that there is some huge mass close to him looming above his head\r\nthrough the trees; and it is with a feeling of awe that he first looks\r\nupon a mountain that although only a few hundred yards away nearly\r\nescaped his search. He is startled by its proximity, and wonders what\r\nstrange forces have been at work to place it there; but his view is\r\ntransitory, and whether proceeding north or south he sees it no more,\r\nunless he essays to climb its slopes.\r\n\r\nVatu Kaisia lies not in the centre but towards the west side of the\r\nYanawai valley the river flowing as an impetuous stream around the foot\r\nof its eastern slope. In the profile-sketch the mountain itself conceals\r\nthe peculiar feature of its position, which is, however, shown in an\r\nexaggerated form in the geological section below. On its west side rises\r\na broad ridge running south which in places is not much higher than the\r\nbasaltic plateau of Wainunu to the west of it. This ridge is only\r\nseparated from Vatu Kaisia by a dark narrow gorge not many hundred yards\r\nin width, across which my natives were able to make themselves heard\r\nwhen near the summit. The mountain rises 1,100 or 1,200 feet above the\r\ngorge on its west side, which is 700 feet above the sea, and some 1,400\r\nor 1,500 feet above the Yanawai river on the east, which is 300 or 400\r\nfeet above the sea. It possesses two peaks, of which the western one is\r\nsmaller and lateral and has a height of 1,600 or 1,650 feet, whilst the\r\neastern is the main peak and rises to 1,880 feet. The saddle between the\r\npeaks has an elevation of about 1,500 feet. It is very difficult to\r\nobtain a distant view of the two peaks, which lie about N.W. and S.E.\r\nwith each other. They are either merged into one as in the view from the\r\nsouth, or else the highest portion of the main peak is alone visible.\r\n\r\nOn the lower slopes of the mountain as high as 1,100 or 1,200 feet is\r\nexposed a porphyritic doleritic basalt showing semi-ophitic augite and\r\nabundant interstitial glass. Its specific gravity is 2·8, but there is\r\nno olivine. It belongs to a type of basalt described under genus 9,\r\nsub-genus A, of the augite-andesites. The upper double-peaked portion\r\nrises precipitously, displaying bare rocky cliff-faces with a drop of\r\n100 or 150 feet, and formed in mass of a grey andesitic rock with a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·71 and showing abundant small porphyritic crystals\r\nof hornblende and rhombic pyroxene. It represents a type of the\r\nhornblende-hypersthene-andesites described on page 301. I was unable,\r\nthrough want of a rope-ladder, to accomplish the last hundred feet of\r\nthe summit; but the general uniformity of structure was evident. No\r\ndetrital rocks came under my observation.\r\n\r\nThat the porphyritic basalt represents a later flow around this old\r\nandesitic mountain is indicated amongst other things by this absence of\r\ntuffs and agglomerates. Vatu Kaisia is undoubtedly the core of an\r\nancient cone of hornblende-andesite, and as in the case of Mount Soloa\r\nLevu, which is formed of somewhat similar andesites (see page 103), it\r\nhas been more or less completely surrounded by later basaltic flows.\r\nVatu Kaisia and Soloa Levu occupy similar positions with respect to the\r\ngreat basaltic table-land of Wainunu, the first lying just within its\r\neastern border, the second lying partly within its western margin.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the ridge immediately west of Vatu Kaisia lends support\r\nto this view of the formation of this region. The ridge is here, it is\r\ntrue, elevated a hundred feet or so above the table-land which is about\r\n1,000 feet above the sea; but whilst on its slopes facing the mountain\r\nthe same porphyritic basalt prevails, there is a limited exposure on its\r\ntop of the same rock (sp. gr. 2·68), differing only in the larger size\r\nof its porphyritic crystals of hornblende and rhombic pyroxene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vatu Kaisia]\r\n\r\nThe narrow gorge isolating the mountain on the west is occupied by a\r\ntributary of the Yanawai River. It has a depth of 400 feet below the\r\nridge; and as illustrated in the section below it has evidently been\r\nlargely formed by the eroding agency of the stream. However, at the\r\nbottom of the gorge there is exposed a heavy aphanitic basalt showing no\r\nolivine and having a specific gravity of 2·85. Though of much finer\r\ntexture, the felspar microliths only measuring ·05 mm. in length, it\r\ndiffers conspicuously from the overlying porphyritic basalt in\r\npossessing little or no interstitial glass. It is referred to genus 16,\r\nspecies A, sub-species 1, of the augite-andesites (page 280).\r\n\r\nThe probable structure of this district is shown in the geological\r\nsection here given. It is assumed from the limited exposure of the same\r\nrock on the top of the ridge that the basaltic flows which surrounded\r\nthe lower portion of Vatu Kaisia at the same time covered over another\r\nsimilar peak lying immediately west of it. Through stream-erosion Vatu\r\nKaisia has now been isolated on its west side; and since the basaltic\r\nrocks rise to about the same height on both sides of the gorge thus\r\nproduced, the original surface was probably as indicated by the dotted\r\nline in the diagram.\r\n\r\nBy following the summit of the ridge, as it runs south on the right side\r\nof the Yanawai valley towards Ndawara, some interesting rocks are\r\nobserved. For the first mile from the camping-place opposite Vatu Kaisia\r\nthe elevation increased from 1,100 to 1,300 feet, and blocks of a\r\nblackish basaltic andesite (sp. gr. 2·76) lay on the ground. About a\r\nmile further on fragments of white quartz-rock appeared on the surface\r\nhaving been thrown out of a shaft close to the track which had been sunk\r\nto a depth of 15 or 20 feet by a gold miner[54] a few years before. I\r\ncould not descend the shaft to examine it: but the specimens picked up\r\nare evidently a white vein-quartz, some of them having a striated\r\n“slickenside” surface on one side.[55] There is evidently a “contact” in\r\nthis locality, probably of a basaltic rock with an acid andesite.\r\n\r\nLeaving the shaft, the track proceeds southward and eastward, and one\r\ndescends gradually from a height of 1,100 feet down to the Yanawai river\r\nwhere the elevation is only about 150 feet above the sea. Occasional\r\nblocks of basaltic rocks lie on the surface of the ridge, and in one\r\nlocality there is exposed a curious-looking agglomerate formed of\r\nfragments of a greenish altered augite-andesite, somewhat scoriaceous,\r\nthe cavities being filled with a zeolite. At the crossing of the river a\r\nblack basalt (sp. gr. 2·82) occurs _in situ_; whilst loose blocks of\r\nbasalt and of an acid andesite occur in the river-bed. Continuing the\r\njourney from the Yanawai crossing to Ndawara near the mouth of the\r\nriver, one follows the track across a range of hills, 500 to 600 feet in\r\nheight, basaltic rocks prevailing on the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE NANDRONANDRANU DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nLying north-west of Vatu Kaisia is an elevated district which I have\r\nnamed after its highest summit, a square-topped peak rather higher than\r\nVatu Kaisia and probably about 2,100 feet above the sea. Koro-ni-yalewa,\r\nwhich signifies “town of the women,” is another name of this peak. It is\r\nshown in the sketch given on page 113, and is situated about two miles\r\nnorth-west of Vatu Kaisia. I did not ascend this mountain, which from\r\nits form would seem to be made of an acid andesite like the Ndrandramea\r\npeaks. Much of this elevated region varies between 1,000 and 1,500 feet\r\nin elevation. It is connected with the Ndrandramea district by somewhat\r\nbroken country not much over 1,000 feet in height, which is the “divide”\r\nbetween the river systems of the Ndreketi and Wainunu. A long\r\ntongue-like extension of similar elevation projects to the north-west\r\nbetween the Ndrawa and Navuningumu branches of the Ndreketi. This\r\nelevated region is continuous to the eastward with the Tavia Range which\r\nis described below. For convenience the valleys of the upper course of\r\nthe Ndrawa river have been included in this district as their geological\r\nfeatures can in this connection be best explained.\r\n\r\nThis region is well distinguished from most of the other districts of\r\nthe island by the prevalence of aphanitic augite-andesites. These rocks\r\nhave also supplied the agglomerates of the locality, and the\r\npalagonite-tuffs which are in places extensively represented are\r\nevidently in great part derived from vitreous forms of the same rocks.\r\nWe seem to get nearer to supra-marine eruptions in this region than in\r\nmost others. The palagonitic-tuffs and agglomerates appear to have\r\nrapidly accumulated in shallow water, and there is reason for regarding\r\none exposure of the aphanitic augite-andesites as at all events a\r\nshallow-water lava-flow. The aphanitic character of the massive rocks,\r\nhowever it may have arisen, is here, as I take it, associated with the\r\nshallow-water habit of the tuffs and agglomerates.\r\n\r\n(1) EAST SIDE OF THE NANDRONANDRANU DISTRICT.—By following the track\r\nleading from the ridge on the west side of Vatu Kaisia northward to\r\nNdrawa one rises gradually to a more elevated region. The rocks exposed\r\non the surface for the first mile are for the most part altered\r\nhypersthene-augite-andesites possessing a micro-felsitic groundmass.\r\nWhen a height of about 1,400 feet was attained, the track could not have\r\nbeen far from the peak of Nandronandranu, but on account of the wood no\r\nview was obtainable. In this locality between 1,300 and 1,400 feet soapy\r\npalagonitic clay-rocks and coarser palagonite-tuffs are displayed on the\r\nsurface. No organic remains are to be noticed in the specimens collected\r\nhere, but they are much affected by hydration. Judging from the\r\nfossiliferous character of similar deposits over a large part of the\r\nisland, it is highly probable that these tuffs and clays are also\r\nsubmarine.\r\n\r\nAfterwards a descent was made to an undulating region about 1½ miles\r\nacross and elevated between 750 and 850 feet. The blocks there displayed\r\non the surface are composed of a dark rather compact augite-andesite\r\nwith a specific gravity of 2·75 (see genus 13) and of an altered\r\ngreenish aphanitic augite-andesite with a specific gravity of 2·59 in\r\nwhich calcite occurs as an alteration product (genus 16). Aphanitic\r\nrocks of this character as shown below, are very prevalent in the\r\nnorth-west and north parts of the Nandronandranu district, but are not\r\nusually altered.\r\n\r\n(2) THE NORTH-WEST PART OF THE NANDRONANDRANU DISTRICT.—The best route\r\nto follow here is to take the track from Nambuna to Ndrawa. After\r\ncrossing the upper portion of the Wainunu table-land one reaches the\r\nheadwaters of the Ndavutu River and then ascends the watershed between\r\nthe Ndreketi and Wainunu river-systems, reaching Savulu, about 1,050\r\nfeet above the sea, where a solitary house marks the site of an old\r\nmountain town. This region is much cut up in deep valleys usually 200 to\r\n300 feet deep, which are occupied by affluents of the Ndrawa branch of\r\nthe Ndreketi, flowing north. The valley of the main affluents is from\r\n400 to 500 feet in depth; and this constant ascent and descent of steep\r\nand often slippery valley sides makes the journey very tedious.\r\n\r\nAt Savulu one stands within the Nandronandranu district. Behind lies the\r\nWainunu table-land with its olivine basalts; but here aphanitic\r\naugite-andesites prevail and extend to Ndrawa and beyond. They are\r\nexposed in position in the stream-courses and furnish most of the blocks\r\nand pebbles found in the bed of the main Ndrawa River for miles down its\r\ncourse towards the sea. They are dark, compact, and non-porphyritic\r\nrocks and are all referred to genus 16 of the augite-andesites as\r\ndescribed on page 279. They vary, however, in certain features, as in\r\nthe specific gravity, the amount of glass, &c. The residual glass is,\r\nhowever, usually small; but in a stream-course east of Savulu I found in\r\nposition at an elevation of 750 feet a semi-vitreous scoriaceous variety\r\nof these rocks, in which the steam-pores had been drawn out into long\r\ntubular cavities half an inch and more in length. The scoriaceous\r\ncharacter is infrequent; but reference should here be made to another\r\nexposure of a slaggy semi-vitreous rock showing abundant steam-pores in\r\nthe tuff-district of the river valley above Ravuka. It differs in some\r\nrespects from the prevailing rock, since it displays prismatic augite as\r\nwell as felspar microliths in its glassy groundmass, and is for this\r\nreason referred to genus 20 of the augite-andesites. In the elevated\r\nregion east of Savulu the aphanitic augite-andesites are in places\r\noverlain by tuffs and agglomerates formed of the same materials. There\r\nis a very good exposure of the tuffs in the Nganga-turuturu cliffs about\r\n2 miles west of Savulu.\r\n\r\n(3) THE NGANGA-TURUTURU CLIFFS.—These picturesque cliffs, 50 to 70 feet\r\nin height, rise up at the head of the Liwa-liwa valley between Savulu\r\nand Ndrawa. They are elevated about 1,200 feet above the sea; and\r\nprobably derive their name from a small waterfall which, after\r\ndescending over their face, drops into the valley below. At its bottom\r\nis situated the hamlet of Liwa-liwa, which is about 600 feet above the\r\nsea. This is the Fijian word for “cold,” and doubtless it has allusion\r\nto the coolness of the valley. On account of the more rapid weathering\r\nof the tuffs in the lower part of the cliffs, there is a rude shelter\r\nafforded by the overhanging portion which is the main feature of\r\ninterest that the cliffs present from a native’s point of view.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs composing the cliffs are horizontally bedded and overlie the\r\nprevailing aphanitic augite-andesite exposed on the valley-slopes below.\r\nOriginally grey in colour, they have been largely affected by the\r\nhydration accompanying the weathering process. They are fine in texture\r\nand somewhat friable, but contain no lime, and are chiefly made up of\r\nthe palagonitised fine detritus of vitreous varieties of the aphanitic\r\naugite-andesites of the district. No organic remains came under my\r\nnotice. Some of the beds contain a number of lapilli of basic pumice, 1\r\nto 3 centimetres in size, which are often in the last stage of the\r\ndisintegration produced during palagonitisation. It would seem probable\r\nthat these lapilli, after having been ejected from some supra-marine\r\nvent, were deposited with the tuffs in the sea around. It should,\r\nhowever, be not forgotten that vesicular and pumiceous materials may be\r\ndischarged during a submarine eruption. When I visited the museum at\r\nCatania, Prof. Platania showed me portions of a bomb, highly vesicular,\r\nthat had been thrown up in a submarine eruption off Vulcano in the\r\nLipari Islands.\r\n\r\n(4) THE UPPER VALLEYS OF THE NDRAWA RIVER.—The two valleys of Liwa-liwa\r\nand Ndrawa meet at Ravuka, where their two streams unite to form the\r\nmain Ndrawa River. The former is the largest; and its large impetuous\r\nstream, during its descent of about two miles from Liwa-liwa past\r\nLutu-kina to Ravuka, which is between 200 and 250 feet above the sea,\r\nhas a drop of 300 or 350 feet. The main stream flows with a gentle\r\ngradient to the coast about ten miles away. I did not descend its course\r\nfor more than two miles below Ravuka, where some hot springs well up\r\nthrough the gravel on the left bank (see page 31.)\r\n\r\nThis is a region of palagonite-tuffs which like those of the\r\nNganga-turuturu cliffs are mainly derived from vitreous and\r\nsemi-vitreous aphanitic augite-andesites. They do not effervesce with an\r\nacid, and neither foraminiferous tests nor other organic remains occur.\r\nThe palagonitic material is usually vacuolar, the vacuoles being filled\r\nwith palagonitic glass or with a zeolite as in the more altered rocks.\r\nWhere bedding is shown, the beds are generally horizontal. These tuffs\r\nare extensively displayed in the sides and beds of the rivers from\r\nLiwa-liwa and Ndrawa to Ravuka and as far as I went down the main river,\r\nnamely to the hot springs. They are associated with agglomerates, formed\r\nof the aphanitic augite-andesites, below Ravuka and in the Ndrawa\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n(5) THE VICINITY OF NDRAWA.—The village of Ndrawa, which is not elevated\r\nmore than 300 feet above the sea, is situated in the heart of the island\r\nin a deep valley more or less hemmed in by the mountains. This is one of\r\nthe wettest localities in Vanua Levu, and probably, as in the case of\r\nthat of Ndriti in the Seatura basin, the rainfall is not far under 300\r\ninches in the year. In the river-gorge descending westward to Ravuka are\r\ndisplayed horizontally bedded palagonite-tuffs and agglomerates above\r\nreferred to in the description of the Ravuka district, and the same\r\nrocks are exposed on the mountain-slopes to the south of the\r\nvillage.[56]\r\n\r\nImmediately to the north lies a broken hilly country, about 800 feet\r\nabove the sea, which has to be crossed on the way to Mbatiri and is much\r\ncut up by streams descending from the vicinity of Na Raro to join the\r\nNdrawa River below Ravuka. The prevailing rocks are tuff-breccias and\r\nagglomerates. The first are made up chiefly of angular fragments, less\r\nthan an inch in size, of aphanitic augite-andesites, some of them being\r\nmore or less vitreous and in different stages of palagonitisation,\r\nwhilst the finer material derived from the same rocks contains some\r\ncarbonate of lime. The agglomerates are composed of the same type of\r\nthese augite-andesites, with however but little interstitial glass. It\r\nshould be added that pebbles of a kind of jasper or iron-flint occur in\r\nthe stream-beds in this locality. (The microscopical characters are\r\ndescribed on page 355.)\r\n\r\nBy following up the valley that extends to the east from Ndrawa, one\r\nenters after about a mile into the region of Na Raro, which is described\r\non page 123.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE TAVIA RANGES.\r\n\r\nNorth of Vatu Kaisia the elevated Nandronadranu district divides into\r\ntwo ranges, one of which stretches eastward to the south of Na Raro as\r\nfar as the gap of that name, whilst the other extends southward on the\r\neast side of the Yanawai valley. Near the angle of bifurcation is\r\nsituated Mount Tavia, a remarkable pyramidal peak marked 2,210 feet in\r\nthe Admiralty chart and lying 1½ miles north-east (N33°E) of Vatu\r\nKaisia. It is shown in the view facing page 108. All this region is\r\ndensely wooded, and I had chiefly to rely on “course-and-distance,” and\r\non my aneroid, to determine the surface-configuration.\r\n\r\n(1) RANGE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE YANAWAI VALLEY.—No ascent of these\r\nhills was made. They vary from 1,500 to 1,800 feet in height, and\r\njudging from the loose blocks and gravel in the bed of the Yanawai River\r\nbelow Vatu Kaisia they would seem to be mainly formed of basaltic rocks,\r\nacid andesites being also represented. However, I crossed the southern\r\nend of the range, where it is 500 to 600 feet in height, to the north of\r\nNdawara, and found basaltic andesites prevailing at the surface.\r\n\r\n(2) RANGE EXTENDING EASTWARD FROM MOUNT TAVIA ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF NA\r\nRARO.—Mount Tavia, which has the appearance of a dacitic peak, was not\r\nascended; but the range was crossed in two places in going from Ndrawa\r\nto Vatu-vono and from Valeni to Nareilangi, its usual height varying\r\nbetween 1,200 and 1,500 feet, the extreme height being about 1,700 feet.\r\n\r\nIn making the traverse from Ndrawa to Vatu-vono, one first passes\r\nthrough a part of the hornblende-andesite region of Na Raro, which is\r\ndescribed in a later page. Afterwards while ascending the north slopes\r\nof the range, basaltic andesites, often doleritic in texture and\r\nreferred to genus 1 of the augite-andesites, are usually found as far as\r\nthe summit 1,200 to 1,300 feet above the sea. On descending the south\r\nslopes one finds coarse and fine palagonite-tuffs and clays at 900 to\r\n1,100 feet up, similar to those prevailing near the sea-border. They are\r\nprobably submarine, but my specimens are weathered and give no\r\neffervescence with an acid. In the bed of the river above Vatu-vono,\r\nabout 400 feet above the sea, there occurs in position an aphanitic\r\naugite-andesite (spec. grav. 2·77), referred to genus 16, species A;\r\nwhilst blocks of a coarser grained basaltic andesite lie loose in the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nIn my traverse across the range from Valeni to Nareilangi I noticed\r\nabout a mile from Valeni and not much over 100 feet above the sea an\r\nagglomerate formed of blocks of an altered acid andesite possessing a\r\nmicro-felsitic groundmass and showing microporphyritic rhombic pyroxene\r\nwith dark alteration borders (spec. grav. 2·5). It is distinct from the\r\nNa Raro rocks; and its presence in an agglomerate seems to indicate the\r\nvicinity of some old acid andesite peak buried beneath later basic\r\neruptive products. Ascending the south slopes of the range, I found\r\ndecomposing basaltic andesites and basic tuffs, the prevailing rocks up\r\nto an elevation of 1,300 feet; but in one locality (800 feet) occurred\r\nlarge masses of what seemed to be a disintegrating dacitic rock\r\npenetrated by quartz veins less than an inch thick. An aphanitic\r\naugite-andesite, of a somewhat exceptional character (spec. grav. 2·63),\r\nwas displayed at the top of the ridge, 1,500 feet above the sea.[57]\r\nBasic rocks were exposed in the spur running northward on the east side\r\nof Na Raro.\r\n\r\nTHE SEA-BORDER EXTENDING EAST FROM THE YANAWAI RIVER TO THE LANGO-LANGO\r\nRIVER.—In this district is included the area between the foot of the\r\nslopes of the Tavia Ranges and the shores of Savu-savu Bay. This\r\nundulating country, two to three miles in breadth, does not attain a\r\ngreater elevation inland than 300 or 400 feet. Fine and coarse\r\npalagonite-tuffs, some of them with the texture of sandstone, are the\r\ncharacteristic rocks. They at times contain a little lime and probably a\r\nfew tests of foraminifera. The palagonitised glass is often vacuolar,\r\nthe vacuoles being filled with the same material. In places where they\r\nare well displayed these tuffs generally show bedding, as in a\r\nhill-slope just east of Vuni-evu-evu, where there are fine and coarse\r\ntuffs interstratified and dipping gently W. by S. Basic agglomerates\r\nalso occur in this district.\r\n\r\nIn the promontory named Yanutha Point in the map there is displayed an\r\nold flow of basaltic lava, showing a columnar structure at the end of\r\nthe point. The columns are 20 inches in diameter, and are inclined about\r\n20 degrees from the vertical in such a direction that it may be inferred\r\nthat the original flow, doubtless submarine, descended at that angle\r\nfrom N.N.W. The dark grey rock of the columns (spec. grav. 2·76) has a\r\nfair amount of interstitial glass, whilst a blackish compact rock (spec.\r\ngrav. 2·78) that represents apparently a more superficial part of the\r\nflow has an abundance of smoky glass in the groundmass. These rocks are\r\nbasaltic andesites and are neither vesicular nor scoriaceous, and come\r\nnear the basalts of the Kiombo flow which, however, contain some olivine\r\n(see page 92). They are semi-ophitic and are referred to genus 21 of the\r\naugite-andesites which is described on page 283.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NA RARO.\r\n\r\nIn Na Raro we have one of the most interesting of the isolated\r\nhornblende-andesite mountains of Vanua Levu. Unlike Vatu Kaisia, which\r\noften eludes the observation, Na Raro is visible from most points of\r\nview. It is double-peaked, the two peaks lying in a north and south line\r\nand rising precipitously. It is this feature that gives the mountain\r\nsuch a variety in its profile. From the north and south it appears as\r\nshown in the accompanying sketch as a sharp conical peak. From the\r\nnorth-east and south-east, as illustrated in the two other sketches, it\r\nhas the form of a blunt or square-topped mountain; and its true shape is\r\nonly shown when it is seen from the east or west. In the photograph here\r\nreproduced which was taken about 1½ miles to the south-west, the two\r\npeaks are with difficulty distinguished. (See frontispiece.)\r\n\r\nNot many ascents have been made of these precipitous peaks. Mr. A.\r\nBarrack, who kindly supplied me with some information about it, made the\r\nascent some years ago; and Mr. Blyth (?), a magistrate, also reached the\r\ntop. There are stories of some big officials being hauled up in baskets;\r\nand the natives told me of a white man who was seized with a\r\nshivering-fit when he arrived at the summit. It is certainly a rather\r\nhazardous climb; but the safest plan is to resign oneself into the hands\r\nof the natives, who “bundle” one up in an expeditious, if not in a very\r\nceremonious, fashion. Nareilangi, near the foot of the mountain on the\r\nnorth side, is a convenient starting-point, and half a dozen stout\r\nFijians will not prove too many to assist the climber in the difficult\r\nparts of the ascent. Since the top usually becomes clouded as the day\r\nprogresses, it is best to spend a night in a cave about 1,400 feet above\r\nthe sea from which the ascent can be made in the early morning. The view\r\nfrom Na Raro is panoramic and extends over a large part of the island\r\nfrom Naivaka to Savu-savu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFILES OF NA RARO.\r\n\r\nFrom the south off Kumbulau Point.\r\n\r\nFrom the north in the Ndreketi Plains.\r\n\r\nFrom the North-east.\r\n\r\nFrom the East-south-east.]\r\n\r\nNa Raro rises up to a height of 2,420 feet in the midst of a region of\r\nbasic rocks. Agglomerates and coarse tuffs formed of aphanitic\r\naugite-andesites prevail in the broken country on the north and west\r\nsides towards Nareilangi and Ndrawa. Immediately south rises the Tavia\r\nRange with its basaltic andesites and overlying palagonite-tuffs; whilst\r\non the east lies a spur of this range.\r\n\r\nNareilangi, the village from which the start is made, is about 2½ miles\r\ndistant from Na Raro, and though situated in the heart of the island it\r\nis only about 100 feet above the sea. The track first passes through a\r\ndistrict of foraminiferous tuffs and clays reaching up to 200 or 250\r\nfeet. Afterwards a broken country extending up to 800 feet is traversed.\r\nHere prevail agglomerates and tuff-agglomerates derived from aphanitic\r\naugite-andesites.[58] One then descends into a valley about 600 feet\r\nabove the sea, and from this place the ascent of the mountain proper\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nThe ascent at first is fairly steep, dacitic tuffs prevailing up to\r\n1,000 or 1,100 feet above the sea and forming in places precipitous\r\ncliff-faces. Large masses of hornblende-andesite lie on the slopes. The\r\ndacitic tuffs distinguish Na Raro from all the other peaks of\r\nhornblende-hypersthene-andesite rocks that I examined. They seem\r\ngenerally to have been stripped off by the denuding agencies; and only\r\nat times, as around the slopes of Ndrandramea and Thokasinga, are to be\r\nfound the remains of agglomerates of the same formation. In the case of\r\nNa Raro, however, the tuffs differ somewhat in their components from the\r\nrocks forming the mountain mass. The tuffs are derived from a\r\nhornblende-andesite of dacitic type; whilst the massive rocks of the\r\nmountain are of hornblende-hypersthene-andesites, without porphyritic\r\nquartz, but approaching the dacitic habit.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs of Na Raro, which are sometimes compacted and at other times\r\nrather friable, do not display bedding. They contain a little lime; but\r\nI found no tests of foraminifera. They are composed of fragments, up to\r\na centimetre in size, of a dacite displaying brown hornblende,\r\nplagioclase, and quartz in a microfelsitic groundmass, together with a\r\nfew fragments of a semi-vitreous basic andesite.\r\n\r\nAbove 1,100 feet the tuffs give place to the massive\r\nhornblende-hypersthene-andesite. At an elevation of 1,450 feet, a\r\nshoulder of the mountain is reached, near the top of which is the cave\r\nabove mentioned. Crossing the shoulder one descends for 100 or 150 feet\r\ninto a gap, thus reaching the foot of the precipitous northern peak,\r\nwhich rises up like a wall for a height of from 900 to 1000 feet\r\noverhead. It is in mass of the andesite just mentioned, many of its\r\nfaces presenting inaccessible cliffs displaying seemingly no structure.\r\nThis peak is somewhat lower than the southern peak. I placed its height\r\nat 2,270 feet, which, taking the total elevation of the mountain at\r\n2,420 feet, as given in the chart, makes the difference 150 feet. A deep\r\nand broad cleft, that goes half-way down the mountain, separates the two\r\npeaks. The southern one, which appears to be inaccessible, is evidently\r\nformed of the same acid andesite.\r\n\r\nThese hornblende-andesites, with or without porphyritic quartz, appear\r\nto be for the most part restricted to the immediate vicinity of Na Raro,\r\nexcept to the south-west, where at a distance of about a mile and a half\r\nfrom the mountain at an elevation of 500 feet occur a rubbly\r\nhornblende-andesite and agglomerates of the same materials. Though the\r\nrock is of the Na Raro type, its presence here is suggestive of a\r\ndistinct vent of small size, of which most of the traces have been swept\r\naway during the emergence of the island. About half a mile south-east of\r\nthis locality at an elevation of 450 feet occur some singular banded\r\npalagonite-tuffs which, although they do not show foraminifera in the\r\nsection examined, contain a little calcite and are probably of submarine\r\norigin.... In this locality I found a large white mass, measuring 4 × 4\r\n× 5 feet, formed of a siliceous rock appearing in thin sections as\r\ngranular chalcedonic quartz (see page 355).\r\n\r\nThe hornblende-andesite of Na Raro, as in the case of the rocks of most\r\nof the other peaks of acid andesites, has its peculiar characters. It\r\ndiffers, for instance, from that of Vatu Kaisia in the larger grain of\r\nthe felsitic groundmass (N. R. ·021 mm.; V. K. ·013 mm.), in the absence\r\nor rarity of phenocrysts of rhombic pyroxene, in its lower specific\r\ngravity (2·6 N. R.: 2·7 V. K.), in the presence of a little interstitial\r\nglass, and in other particulars. Both, however, belong to the sub-class\r\nof hornblende-hypersthene-andesites, and are described on page 301. In\r\nthe Na Raro rock the rhombic pyroxene is represented in the groundmass.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the relative age of Na Raro I am inclined to think that\r\nit is the most recent of the acid andesite peaks of the island. Neither\r\nvitreous nor vesicular rocks came under my notice in its vicinity;\r\nwhilst the tuffs that clothe its lower slopes are non-pumiceous, though\r\nof dacitic origin, but containing also a few fragments of a semivitreous\r\nbasic andesite showing tiny felspar lathes and augite-granules. Since\r\nthe everywhere prevailing submarine palagonite-tuffs and foraminiferous\r\nclays do not extend over its area, we may assign to it a later date. It\r\nis evidently also posterior in time to the basaltic andesites and\r\naphanitic augite-andesites around, which are covered by these submarine\r\ndeposits. Relatively recent as it apparently is, this mountain bears the\r\nimpress of a high antiquity. There is nothing to indicate that this\r\n“core” of a volcanic mountain belonged to a subaerial vent. Na Raro has\r\nshared in all the later stages of the submergence and emergence of the\r\nisland. Though it presents the final page in the history of the\r\nhornblende-andesite volcanoes, that chapter has been for unknown ages\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nTHE NA RARO GAP.—Between the Tavia and Va-lili Ranges there is a break\r\nin the mountainous backbone of the island, to which I have given this\r\nname. The greatest elevation is probably not over 800 feet. It is from\r\nthe south side of this watershed that the Lango-lango river takes its\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE BASALTIC LOWLANDS OF SARAWANGA AND NDREKETI.\r\n\r\nONE of the most striking features of the north side of the island is the\r\nextensive undulating plain that stretches from the Lekutu river to near\r\nSealevu on the head-waters of the Ndreketi, a distance of almost 30\r\nmiles. In its western half this plain slopes gradually to the sea-coast,\r\nwhere it is bordered by a broad belt of mangroves. In its eastern half,\r\nfrom the mouth of the Ndreketi eastward, the lofty Nawavi coast range\r\nintervenes between it and the sea-shore. Its breadth varies usually\r\nbetween 4 and 6 miles, and its elevation, though it reaches a maximum of\r\nabout 300 feet, is as a rule between 100 and 200 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nOver nearly all its area it presents the dried-up and scantily vegetated\r\nappearance of the “talasinga” regions. It is an open country mostly\r\nclear of forest; and it is to this character as well as to its peculiar\r\nvegetation that it in some measure owes its barren look. Amongst the\r\nbracken, grass, and tall reeds (Eulalia japonica) that clothe much of\r\nits surface flourish the Pandanus, the Casuarina, and the Cycad, which\r\ngive a special physiognomy to the whole area; whilst several sea-side\r\nplants, as Ipomea pes capræ, Morinda citrifolia, Cerbera odollam, &c.,\r\nhave spread themselves far and wide over its extent. It is traversed by\r\nthe rivers Ndreketi, Sarawanga, and Lekutu, the two first named being\r\nnavigable for several miles, as the tide ascends a long way from the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nIn its essential characters this region corresponds with the Mbua and\r\nNdama plains at the west end of the island, which have been previously\r\ndescribed. Wherever the rivers have worn channels of any depth, basaltic\r\nrocks, sometimes columnar in structure, are exposed; and over most of\r\nits surface the same rocks are displayed, often much decomposed and\r\ndeveloping a spheroidal character, or lying in large blocks all around.\r\nOverlying the basaltic rocks in various localities occur foraminiferous\r\nclays and other submarine deposits. This great region of plains is\r\npartially divided into two by the projecting mass of the dacitic\r\ndistrict of Ndrandramea, the slopes of which descend to within 3 or 4\r\nmiles of the coast between the Sarawanga and Ndreketi rivers. For\r\nconvenience of description I will deal with these two sub-regions\r\nseparately under the names of the Sarawanga and Ndreketi plains.\r\n\r\nTHE BASALTIC PLAINS OF SARAWANGA.— These plains extend about 6 miles\r\ninland to the village of Tembe-ni-ndio on the head-waters of the\r\nSarawanga river. The prevailing type of basalt in this region is a\r\nporphyritic olivine-basalt showing a few large crystals of glassy\r\nplagioclase and having a specific gravity of 2·84 to 2·9. They are\r\nneither vesicular nor scoriaceous and are referred to genera 25 and 37\r\nof the olivine class. The felspar-lathes of the groundmass average\r\n·2 mm. in length, and there is a little interstitial glass. They cannot\r\noften be distinguished in their characters from the olivine-basalt\r\ndisplayed in vertical columns, 4 to 5 feet in diameter, on the lower\r\nslopes of Seatura at the back of Tembe-ni-ndio (page 63). It is highly\r\nprobable that most of the basalts of these plains belong to lava-flows\r\nthat descended from the great Seatura vent. In the lowlands it is much\r\ndecomposed, and a spheroidal structure is frequently developed during\r\nthe disintegrating process, just as has been noticed in the case of the\r\nMbua and Ndama plains on the west side of Seatura. The rounded blocks\r\nthat commonly occur on the surface may be regarded in each instance as\r\nthe nucleus of a weathering spheroidal mass. When this rock is exposed\r\nunaltered in the streams it is usually massive or non-columnar.\r\n\r\nThere is a less common type of basalt in this region which perhaps may\r\nrepresent the upper portion of these basaltic flows. I found it exposed\r\nin the bed of the Selesele river about half-way between Lekutu and\r\nSarawanga and about 2 miles inland, where it formed vertical columns 1½\r\nfeet across. It differs principally in the presence of a few small\r\namygdules and in the greater amount of interstitial glass. The columnar\r\nbasalt that Dana in the “Geology of the United States Exploring\r\nExpedition” describes as occurring at the mouth of the same river\r\nprobably belongs to the same flow. He remarks that a few hundred yards\r\nback from the “Watering-place” there is an exposure of columnar basalt,\r\nthe columns being vertical, 1 to 2½ feet in diameter, and usually\r\nsix-sided.\r\n\r\nThe incrusting submarine deposits found in patches over these plains are\r\ngenerally calcareous clay-rocks containing tests of formaminifera and\r\noften also univalve, bivalve, and pteropod shells. They are referred to\r\nthe foraminiferous mud-rocks described on page 321. Such deposits are\r\nproperly dark-coloured; but as exposed at and near the surface they have\r\noften lost by hydration most of their lime, and have acquired by the\r\nremoval of the iron oxides a whitish or pale-yellow appearance, whilst\r\nthey have a peculiar soapy “feel,” on account of which they are\r\ngenerally known as “soapstone” amongst the whites. Streams flowing\r\nthrough such districts have a somewhat milky colour. These deposits are\r\nextensively represented on the slopes of the Sarawanga valley, and\r\nespecially to the east of the town of that name. They are well displayed\r\non the way from Sarawanga to Tembe-ni-ndio, and are also to be seen on\r\nthe surface of the plains between Lekutu and the Mbua-Lekutu watershed\r\nto the southward.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Sarawanga they attain an elevation of 200 feet above\r\nthe sea; but they may be traced in patches up to 500 feet on the\r\nadjacent slopes of the acid andesite region of Ndrandramea. Near the\r\nriver, and less than 100 feet above the sea, these deposits are in one\r\nplace overlain by an agglomerate formed of large blocks, 1 to 2 feet\r\nacross, of these Ndrandramea andesites and dacites. In another place,\r\nnear the town of Sarawanga, I found them exposed in the river-bank,\r\nwhere they were covered over by a coarse palagonitic bedded tuff,\r\ndipping gently eastward and somewhat calcareous. From the character of\r\nthe shells of marine univalves inclosed in this tuff, it appears to have\r\nbeen formed in shallow water.\r\n\r\nA very interesting display of these surface marine deposits occurs in\r\nthe upper part of the Sarawanga valley in the vicinity of Tembe-ni-ndio.\r\nHere we have fine and coarse calcareous palagonitic tuffs, containing\r\ntests of foraminifera, associated with impure foraminiferal limestones.\r\nThey occur up to elevations of 300 feet above the sea on either side of\r\nthe Sarawanga valley above this town, incrusting on the north side the\r\nlower dacitic slopes of the Ndrandramea district, and on the south side\r\nthe lower basaltic slopes of Seatura. At the bottom of the valley, as in\r\nthe rising ground between Tavua and Tembe-ni-ndio, they conceal in part\r\nthe basaltic rocks of the district.\r\n\r\nNear the last-named place, on the right bank of the Tembe-ni-ndio branch\r\nof the Sarawanga river, the foraminiferal limestones are displayed in\r\nlow cliffs 15 to 20 feet in height. They are sometimes earthy when they\r\ncontain about 25 per cent. of lime, and at other times more compact with\r\nabout 45 per cent. of lime, the residue being composed of palagonitic\r\nmaterials, tiny fragments of minerals and of a basic rock, &c.[59] Large\r\nshells, of Ostræa and Cardium are also contained in these limestones,\r\nthe valves being detached from each other. The oyster shells project\r\nfrom the weathered surface; and it is probable that the name of\r\nTembe-ni-ndio, which signifies “the shell of the oyster,” may be thus\r\nexplained. Underneath the foraminiferal limestones in this locality\r\noccur bedded coarse tufaceous sandstones, slightly inclined E.N.E., and\r\ninclosing waterworn gravel and pebbles. These low limestone cliffs,\r\nalthough about six miles inland, are not more than 120 or 130 feet above\r\nthe sea. In their face there is evidence of an old erosion-line of the\r\nriver 10 or 11 feet above its present level.\r\n\r\nBy following up this branch of the river for a little distance I came\r\nupon an exposure of nearly horizontal bedded palagonitic tuffs on its\r\nfloor and sides. Here a coarse tuff, of which the larger fragments\r\ncomposing it range between 3 and 5 mm. in size, passes upward into a\r\nchocolate-coloured compact tuff-clay formed of the same materials, the\r\nlarger averaging ·2 or ·3 mm. in size. These tuffs are made up chiefly\r\nof a palagonitised vacuolar basic glass, the vacuoles being filled with\r\nthe alteration products. The lower coarse tuffs contain very little\r\nlime, probably not over 1 per cent., and exhibit no organic remains in\r\nthe slide. The upper fine tuffs have 3 or 4 per cent. of lime, and\r\ninclose numerous minute tests of foraminifera of the globigerina type,\r\ntheir cavities being generally filled with palagonitic material.\r\n\r\nFurther up the valley about a mile above Tembe-ni-ndio, and about 250\r\nfeet above the sea, the impure foraminiferal limestones again appear;\r\nbut they here exhibit an important difference in texture. In the\r\ngroundmass of those of the lower locality, the calcite is granular and\r\nloosely arranged, or displays in an obscurely indicated mosaic the\r\ncommencement of recrystallization. In the case of those of the upper\r\nlocality the calcitic material of the groundmass has more completely\r\nrecrystallized, and shows a fairly clear mosaic; whilst in one place the\r\nrock was overlain or rather incrusted above by a layer, 3 inches thick,\r\nof a white crystalline limestone, looking like statuary marble, and\r\ninclosing portions of a material like that of the rock beneath it. This\r\nlast, when examined in the slide, exhibits itself as formed in mass of\r\ncrystalline calcite, displaying a regular mosaic, and inclosing small\r\nfragments of palagonitised materials and of minerals (pyroxene) such as\r\nare abundant in the rock below. In places the grains of the mosaic are\r\nbordered by brown and black iron oxide. It would, therefore, appear that\r\na metamorphism has been in operation here, and that the process which\r\nbegan with the recrystallization of the matrix in the lower rock is\r\nalmost completed in the overlying thin layer where even most of the\r\nnon-calcareous materials have disappeared. No evidence suggestive of\r\ncontact-metamorphism came under my notice in this locality. These\r\nforaminiferal limestones are surface formations, and it was in the\r\nuppermost portion that the metamorphism was most complete. We here\r\nwitness in operation the transformation of a rock containing 46 per\r\ncent. of carbonate of lime (the residue of minerals, palagonite, &c.),\r\ninto a marble or crystalline limestone. I gather that as in the instance\r\nof several of our old British limestones the change is a purely\r\ninterstitial one, and is not connected with thermal metamorphism.\r\n\r\nThese remarks on the basaltic plains of Sarawanga and on their\r\nincrusting submarine deposits may be concluded with a brief reference to\r\nthe siliceous concretions, 2 or 3 inches across, the silicified portions\r\nof corals, and the fragments of clay iron-stone and limonite resembling\r\nhæmatite, that occur frequently on the surface. They are common on the\r\nplains south of Lekutu and between Lekutu and Sarawanga, and up to\r\nelevations of 200 feet in the foraminiferous clay district east of\r\nSarawanga, where fragments looking like portions of the silicified\r\nbranches of Madrepores are to be found; but they are not limited to such\r\nlocalities, and may occur also where the surface is formed of decomposed\r\nbasaltic rock. (These matters are generally discussed in Chapter XXV.)\r\n\r\nTHE BASALTIC PLAINS OF THE NDREKETI.—This low-lying region of rolling\r\n“talasinga” country now serves as the basin of the Ndreketi river, the\r\nlargest of the rivers of Vanua Levu. It is usually elevated between 100\r\nand 300 feet above the sea, and its limits are well defined by the 300\r\nfeet contour line in the map of the island. On the east it is separated\r\nfrom the basin common to the Wailevu and Lambasa rivers by the Sealevu\r\nDivide, which is described on p. 136. On the west, as before observed,\r\nit is only in part distinguished from the basin of the Sarawanga by the\r\nspur descending from the dacitic mountains of Ndrandramea. It meets the\r\ncoast in the vicinity of the mouth of the Ndreketi; but for two-thirds\r\nof its length it is cut off from the sea by the great Nawavi range. It\r\nsupports the characteristic vegetation of the “talasinga” or sun-burnt\r\nland. Whilst the Pandanus and the Casuarina are most conspicuous amongst\r\nthe trees, bushes, herbs, grasses and ferns predominate. Here the native\r\nGinger and the native Turmeric with species of Tacca are frequently to\r\nbe recognised, and the waste-land bushes of Dodonæa viscosa and Mussænda\r\nfrondosa are abundantly to be found.\r\n\r\nAs in the Sarawanga plains, the basaltic rocks are here often overlain\r\nor incrusted by submarine deposits, the former exposed in all the deeper\r\nriver-beds, the latter frequently displayed in the sides of their\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\nI will deal first with the basaltic rocks. In the places where the\r\nsurface deposits have been stripped off, these rocks are generally\r\nexposed as decomposing boulders, the spheroidal structure being well\r\ndeveloped in the weathering process. Not infrequently, however, a rudely\r\ncolumnar structure is exhibited where the rivers have cut deeply into\r\nthe basalt. The columns that I observed were usually vertical. In the\r\nriver-bed at the landing-place at Mbatiri, for instance, the columns are\r\nfrom 2½ to 3 feet across and vertical. As exposed in the river-crossing\r\nabout a mile above this town they are 12 to 15 inches in diameter and\r\nalso vertical. However, at Na Kalou, a coast village about 1½ miles east\r\nof the mouth of the Ndreketi, where there is an unexpected exposure of\r\nbasalt, the columns, about a foot in diameter, are inclined at an angle\r\nof about 20° from the vertical and face to the north.\r\n\r\nThese rocks are, as a rule, compact, only showing a typical scoriaceous\r\nstructure in the case of specimens obtained near the foot of Nakambuta,\r\nan isolated hill about three miles to the southward of Natua, which\r\nprobably represents a vent of more recent times. Often, however, they\r\nhave a pseudo-vesicular appearance, from the occurrence in the midst of\r\nthe patches of interstitial glass of minute irregular cavities that seem\r\nto have been formed during the last stage of consolidation of the magma.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing type of basalts is a blackish, doleritic, semi-ophitic\r\nrock without olivine, with specific gravity 2·78 to 2·80. They are\r\ncharacterised by the length of the felspars of the groundmass\r\n(·22-·35 mm.), by the large size of the augite granules (·1-·3 mm.), and\r\nby the quantity of dark interstitial glass. They present two forms, one\r\nwith and the other without plagioclase phenocrysts. The first kind is\r\nreferred to genus 9 of the augite-andesites (page 272), some of the\r\nspecimens being referred to the porphyritic sub-genus, and others to the\r\nnon-porphyritic sub-genus, according to the size of the plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts. The second kind, without felspar phenocrysts, belongs to\r\ngenus 12 of the same class (page 275). A good example of the porphyritic\r\nrocks is afforded in the large blocks lying in the stream-beds during\r\nthe first half of the way from Ndreketi to Sarawanga.\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out here that these doleritic, semi-ophitic basaltic\r\nandesites of the Ndreketi plains differ conspicuously from the\r\nprevailing type found on the slopes of Seatura, on the Sarawanga and\r\nMbua plains, and on the Wainunu table-land. There we have, as a rule,\r\nolivine-basalts, having a specific gravity of 2·86 to 2·90, and showing\r\nbut scanty interstitial glass, the felspars of the groundmass being on\r\nthe average not over ·2 mm. in length, whilst the augite granules are,\r\nas a rule, only ·02-·03 mm. in diameter, and the ophitic structure is\r\ninfrequent.\r\n\r\nThe submarine deposits, consisting of foraminiferous clays and coarser\r\ntuff-sandstones, the former being usually beneath, are found at\r\nintervals all over this area. They occur inland as far as Vuinasanga and\r\nNareilangi, near the base of the mountains of Va Lili and Na Raro,\r\nreaching as high as 300 feet, their place being taken on the mountain\r\nslopes by coarser tuffs and agglomerates. When not weathered they are\r\nmore or less calcareous, and contain occasionally marine molluscan\r\nshells, whilst palagonitic debris enter largely into their composition.\r\nThe foraminiferous clays, often much bleached by hydration, are well\r\nrepresented around Mbatiri and in the districts between that town and\r\nNatua and Nareilangi. They are relatively deep-water deposits, and\r\nbelong to the type described on page 323. Others, again, as exposed in\r\nthe banks of the river at Natua, are chocolate coloured and of the kind\r\nreferred to in detail on page 335. These foraminiferous clays in the\r\nregion between Natua and Mbatiri are overlain in places by coarse,\r\nalmost brecciated, tuffs, formed in part of the debris of acid\r\nandesites, such as compose the not far distant mountain of Na Raro.\r\n\r\nSince the massive basaltic rocks are exposed in all the deeper rock\r\nchannels of these plains, it is apparent that the overlying submarine\r\ndeposits can possess no great thickness. Probably they are never 100\r\nfeet thick, and usually far less. In many places, through their\r\ndenudation, the underlying basaltic rocks are exposed, and in a\r\ndecomposing condition largely form the surface. These deposits as a rule\r\ndisplay bedding, the beds being horizontal or at least only inclined 2\r\nor 3 degrees. This horizontality is a nearly constant feature of these\r\nsubmarine beds, as they overlie the basaltic rocks of the plains; and it\r\nis a feature we should expect to find where there has been emergence\r\nrather than upheaval.\r\n\r\nSiliceous concretions and silicified coral fragments, so characteristic\r\nof the surface of some of these plains of Vanua Levu, did not frequently\r\ncome under my notice here. They, however, occur occasionally, as in the\r\ndistrict between Nanduri and Natua.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE NAWAVI RANGE.\r\n\r\nWith this remarkable coast range, which fronts the Mathuata sea-border\r\nfor a distance of 12 or 13 miles between Ravi-ravi Point and Nanduri, I\r\nhave unfortunately but scant acquaintance. It attains its maximum\r\nelevation in Mount Nawavi of 2,238 feet, and is described by Mr. J. P.\r\nThomson,[60] who surveyed this coast, as broken in two nearly opposite\r\nNiurua, the pyramidal mountain of Koro Navuta rising in the gap. Various\r\nother peaks, besides that of Nawavi, are marked in the latest Admiralty\r\nchart; they vary in height from 1,000 to 1,700 feet. As this range lies\r\nonly a mile or less back from the beach, it gives to the sea-border a\r\nbold and often precipitous appearance, which is well shown in an\r\nillustration in Wilkes’ _Narrative of the United States Exploring\r\nExpedition_ (iii. 226).\r\n\r\nBasic rocks probably prevail in this range. When I ascended its eastern\r\nspurs from Nanduri, and reached a height of 800 feet, only basic tuffs\r\nand agglomerates came under my notice. From Dana’s remarks[61] it is to\r\nbe inferred that the “frowning bluffs” opposite Mathuata Island are of\r\nsimilar formation; and it would seem that the rugged black stones,\r\ndescribed in the _Admiralty Sailing Directions_[62] as topping the hills\r\nbehind Ravi-ravi Point, are of the same basic character. From its\r\ncontour and profile I would gather that, as in the great mountainous\r\nridges that constitute the backbone of the island between Va Lili and\r\nMount Thurston, palagonitic tuffs and clays of submarine origin will,\r\ntogether with volcanic agglomerates, be found far up the slopes of this\r\nrange, and that the axis will prove to be largely composed of massive\r\nbasic rocks.\r\n\r\nThe hot springs referred to by Thomson and others as occurring at the\r\nfoot of the north and south slopes, namely at Vatuloaloa, Nambuonu, and\r\nin another unnamed inland locality, are briefly mentioned on page 31.\r\n\r\nTHE SEALEVU DIVIDE.—This broad range which separates the Ndreketi and\r\nLambasa basins is an offshoot from the central mountains at Sealevu and\r\nreaches the coast just east of Nanduri. Its highest part according to\r\nthe elevation given in the Admiralty chart is 1,437 feet. The road from\r\nSealevu to Nanduri, which crosses its broad level summit for a distance\r\nof about three miles, does not rise over 1,100 feet. Between 800 and\r\n1,100 feet are exposed calcareous tuffs and clays all largely made up of\r\npalagonitic materials. The coarser might be described as sandstones. The\r\nclays have 12 per cent. of lime and are foraminiferous and are of the\r\ntype described on page 321. The rocks displayed on the lower northern\r\nslopes on the way to Nanduri are at first the same submarine deposits,\r\nand afterwards decomposing basaltic andesites. It is apparent that in\r\nthe central elevated part of this range there are hills of volcanic\r\nformation more or less completely buried beneath these deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE DISTRICT BETWEEN NANDURI BAY AND WAILEVU RIVER\r\n\r\nThe sea-border between Nanduri Bay and Middle Point, nearly four miles\r\nto the east, consists of a fringe of lowland margined by the\r\nmangrove-belts and banked by a line of hills between a quarter and\r\ntwo-thirds of a mile inland. These hills form a continuation of the\r\nNawavi coast range of mountains extending from Ravi-ravi Point to\r\nNanduri. They attain their greatest height in the case of Ulu-i-sori, a\r\ncockscomb-like peak 1,141 feet above the sea. Another of these hills,\r\nVatu-tangiri, is capped by a remarkable obelisk-like rock. Behind this\r\ncoast range lies a hill with an elevation of nearly 1,400 feet.\r\n\r\nThe rocks exposed for the first mile or two along the coast east of\r\nNanduri are agglomerates and basic tuffs. The blocks of the\r\nagglomerates, however, are made of an altered grey porphyritic rock\r\nwhich has the characters of a porphyrite of a rather acid type.[63] This\r\ncomposition of the agglomerate is quite exceptional and indicates the\r\nantiquity of the volcanic rocks in this locality. Farther along the\r\ncoast the typical agglomerates occur, where the blocks, 3 to 10 inches\r\nacross, are composed of the usual semi-vitreous black basaltic rock\r\nshowing plagioclase phenocrysts. Nearer Middle Point a decaying\r\ndoleritic basalt is displayed at the surface. It is similar to the\r\nprevailing rock of the Ndreketi plains, and is referred to the ophitic\r\nrocks forming genus 9 of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nThe elevated promontory of Middle Point is a prolongation of a spur of\r\nUlu-i-sori. Where it is crossed by the road it is about 350 feet above\r\nthe sea. On its west slopes are exposed yellowish-white tuff-like rocks,\r\nevidently the prevailing basic clay-tuffs which have become bleached\r\nthrough the hydration accompanying the weathering process. Beneath these\r\ndeposits lies an amygdaloidal augite-andesite which is bared in places.\r\nThe rock is semi-vitreous and the amygdules it contains are often a\r\ncentimetre long. They are composed of a white mineral with fibro-radiate\r\nstructure and made up of needle-like prisms. It gives off water, but it\r\nis not easily fused, and does not gelatinise in HCl.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the promontory the road strikes inland in an\r\neast-south-east direction for Tambia, passing inside the coast range,\r\nwhich is here 600 feet in height, and descending gradually through a\r\nregion of basaltic andesite into the valley of the Tambia river. (This\r\nrock, which has a specific gravity of 2·84, displays more or less\r\nparallel stout felspar-lathes, ·23 mm. in length, and has a little\r\ninterstitial glass. It belongs to genus 13 of the augite-andesites.) Low\r\nhills shut in the little valley on all sides except where the river\r\nbreaks through the coast range. The town of Tambia is not over 100 feet\r\nabove the sea. About a mile to the north exist hot springs of\r\nconsiderable extent which are described on page 32.\r\n\r\nThe road from Tambia to the Wailevu River traverses an undulating\r\ndistrict varying from 100 to 300 feet above the sea. A basalt containing\r\na little olivine, with a specific gravity of 2·91, is commonly exposed\r\nat the surface in a disintegrating condition. Here and there occur basic\r\ntuffs. In one locality, there is displayed a dyke-like mass in a small\r\nstream course, 200 feet above the sea, of an altered grey and compact\r\nandesite marked with parallel red streaks or bands. It is an aphanitic\r\naugite-andesite; and is to be referred to genus 13 of the augite\r\nsub-class. It displays closely crowded felspar-lathes, ·07 mm. in\r\nlength, in flow-arrangement. The bands are due to the gathering of the\r\nresidual glass in streaks parallel to the flow. Chalcedonic flints, some\r\nof them showing the agate-structure, together with fragments of\r\nsilicified corals, are found occasionally on the surface in this\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE LAMBASA PLAINS\r\n\r\nThese remarkable inland plains, about ten miles long and three to five\r\nmiles broad, are well described in the Admiralty chart as a low\r\nundulating country covered with grass, screw-pines, and Casuarina trees.\r\nThey are backed by the mountains forming the central axis of the island,\r\nwhilst broken groups of hills, not usually more than 500 or 600 feet in\r\nheight and attaining in Ulu-i-Mbau an elevation of 1,160 feet, intervene\r\nbetween them and the sea-border. They are traversed by the Wailevu,\r\nLambasa, and Ngawa rivers which after breaking through the seaward\r\nhill-ranges pass through broad mangrove-belts to reach the coast. The\r\ntide ascends these river-courses for several miles; and in the case of\r\nthe Lambasa river boats can follow its winding course for ten miles\r\npenetrating into the heart of the plains. Much of this level inland\r\nregion is less than 100 feet above the sea; whilst the contour line of\r\n300 feet by which the region is defined in the map attached to this book\r\nfairly well indicates the higher levels.\r\n\r\nThe features which we have described in the instances of the Sarawanga\r\nand Ndreketi plains are in the main reproduced in the Lambasa region;\r\nbut in the last-named each of the three rivers has a system of hot\r\nsprings along its course, namely (as described in Chapter III.), at Na\r\nKama on the Wailevu River, at Vuni-moli on the Lambasa River, and at\r\nMbati-ni-kama on the Ngawa River. Basaltic andesites, often exposed at\r\nthe surface in a decomposing condition, form the foundation of the\r\nplains. They are overlain by submarine clays containing pteropod shells\r\nand tests of foraminifera; and over these in their turn coarse\r\npalagonitic tuffs and agglomerate-tuffs are found in places. Formations\r\nstill more recent are represented by elevated reef-rock on the seaward\r\nside of the hills that bound the plains. Nodules of chalcedony,\r\nsilicified corals, and other siliceous rocks, together with fragments of\r\nimpure limonite, lie on the surface over much of this region.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic rocks of this region rarely show olivine, and belong as a\r\nrule to the basaltic andesites, being referred to genera 13 and 21 of\r\nthe augite-andesites, the specific gravity being about 2·8. The\r\nfelspar-lathes, ·12 to ·14 mm. in length, are in flow-arrangement, and\r\nthe augite is at times semi-ophitic; whilst there is a little\r\ninterstitial glass. The basic rocks prevailing between Vatu-levoni and\r\nVandrani belong to genus 13 of the augite-hypersthene-andesites and have\r\na groundmass of much finer texture, the felspars only measuring ·05 mm.\r\nTheir specific gravity ranges between 2·7 and 2·75.\r\n\r\nThe overlying foraminiferous and pteropod clay rocks, the so-called\r\n“soapstone,” are exposed over large areas of the surface. A good idea of\r\nthe important part they take in the formation of the lower plains may be\r\nformed by visiting the hot springs of Vunimbele, close to Vuni-moli,\r\nwhich issue from the side of a deep trench cut into these deposits. As\r\ngenerally displayed at the surface, they have been subjected to so much\r\nhydration in the weathering process that they appear as yellowish-white\r\nclay-rocks deprived of their lime; and it is only now and then that the\r\nremains of foraminifera and pteropods can be detected. They are,\r\nhowever, fairly well preserved around the base of Ulu-i-mbau in the\r\nvicinity of Koro-wiri, where they contain, besides the shells of\r\npteropods and foraminifera, portions of decaying coral, and extend to\r\n200 feet and over above the sea. Here they are overlain by rather\r\ncoarser basic tuffs of mixed character, containing 5 or 6 per cent. of\r\ncarbonate of lime and some palagonite, which I followed as high as the\r\ntrack lay, rather over 500 feet above the sea.[64] The reef-limestones,\r\nalready noticed as exposed in the low hills between Wailevu and Lambasa,\r\nlie a mile or two inland and reach to 100 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of siliceous rocks, which with occasional bits of impure\r\nlimonite, occur at intervals all over the surface of these plains and\r\nlargely form the gravel and pebbles in the river-beds, include nodules\r\nof chalcedony, fragments of jasper or iron-flint, white quartz-rock\r\nformed of chalcedonic silica, silicified corals, &c. They are especially\r\nfrequent in the vicinity of Nasawana and Koro-utari, and include fine\r\nspecimens of agates and of onyx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE VA-LILI RANGE\r\n\r\nTHIS range extends from the Na Raro Gap before mentioned to the\r\nNdreke-ni-wai river. It is partly isolated on the north-east from the\r\nKorotini Range, the extension eastward of the mountainous axis of the\r\nisland, by a depression or saddle which at its lowest part is not more\r\nthan 1,200 or 1,300 feet above the sea; but there is no real break in\r\nthe line of mountains. It is, however, convenient to make this\r\ndistinction, and I have named the dip between the two ranges, the\r\nWaisali Saddle. The range now to be described attains its greatest\r\nelevation in the summit of Va-lili, which is 2,930 feet above the sea.\r\nThere are two or three other peaks that exceed 2,000 feet, and much of\r\nthe range is not under 1,700 feet. My acquaintance with this range is\r\nnot extensive; but it will serve to illustrate its general geological\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe summit of Va-lili is very conspicuous from most points of view. From\r\nthe north, east, and south-east, it has a remarkable broad and\r\nsquare-topped profile with a little conical elevation in the centre.\r\nFrom the south-west, it displays a different outline with a solitary\r\nsquarish block on the top, and this is the form most familiar to the\r\nnavigator. Unfortunately, for reasons given below, I did not quite reach\r\nthe summit, and although I was able to obtain sufficient data for\r\nforming a general idea of the structure of this part of the range, the\r\nstructure of the actual summit has yet to be ascertained.\r\n\r\n(1) ASCENT OF VA-LILI FROM NARENGALI.—This village, which is elevated\r\n400 feet above the sea, lies about two miles in a direct line, N.N.E.\r\nfrom the peak. In traversing the intervening country, one crosses the\r\nLoma-loma ridge, elevated 1,000 feet, on the top of which was once\r\nsituated the village of Loma-loma visited by Horne in 1878. The rocks\r\nexposed on the surface are scanty, a hard palagonite-tuff, which owes\r\nits induration to a calcitic cement, occurring on the upper part of the\r\nridge; the original site of the village being marked by a large block of\r\nthis stone.[65] The track then descends into the valley of the Loma-loma\r\nriver, about 400 feet above the sea, in the bed of which occur blocks of\r\nan amygdaloidal basaltic andesite, containing phenocrysts of both\r\nrhombic and monoclinic pyroxene, and referred to genus 1 of the rhombic\r\npyroxene andesites. The amygdules are formed of calcite.\r\n\r\n                 PROFILE-SKETCHES OF THE VA-LILI RANGE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from the south-east near Savarekareka.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from the south-west.]\r\n\r\nBeyond the river the ascent of the northern slope of Va-lili begins. As\r\nhigh as 1,100 feet occur basic agglomerates overlying fine and coarse\r\npalagonite-tuffs, which are at times horizontally bedded, the finer\r\nkinds being sometimes calcareous, and like that of the Loma-loma ridge\r\nabove mentioned. At 1,300 feet is a line of tall cliffs which extend for\r\nsome distance at intervals along the mountain-slope, and are indicated\r\nby some fine waterfalls. My track struck these cliffs at a place named\r\n“Nangara-ravi” (the leaning cave-rock) where they have a height of 150\r\nfeet or more. The tall cliff leans slightly forward, so that it forms a\r\nshelter at its foot, and hence the name. It is composed of a\r\ntuff-agglomerate, the blocks, which are formed of a semi-vitreous\r\nbasaltic andesite of the augite class, being not generally more than 3\r\nor 4 inches across. These blocks, which are rounded on the outer exposed\r\nside and angular on the imbedded side, are inclosed in a hard, probably\r\ncalcareous matrix. The whole face of the cliff has the appearance of\r\nhaving been worn smooth by attrition, and there are not to be observed\r\nthe projecting blocks from its surface which are so characteristic of\r\nother agglomerate-cliffs. It shows no stratification; but at its base\r\nflush with the cliff-face are large masses of a basic massive rock. But\r\nfew portions of rock have been detached from the cliff. However, I found\r\nin the midst of a huge fallen fragment of the agglomerate a dyke-like\r\nmass of a basaltic andesite, which differs chiefly from the rock forming\r\nthe blocks of the agglomerate in being more crystalline. This dyke must\r\nhave been about 15 feet thick.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to these various features, I am inclined to consider that\r\nthis leaning cliff represents one side of a large fissure in the\r\nagglomerates which was occupied by a dyke. Reference has been above made\r\nto the fact that the agglomerates may be seen overlying the tuffs\r\nfarther down the slope, so that the conditions favourable for landslips\r\nexist. I have shown on page 111 that the origin of the Mbenutha cliffs\r\nwhere agglomerates lie on clayey tuffs may be thus attributed to a\r\nlandslip. In the case of the Nangara-ravi cliffs, the occurrence of this\r\nfragment of a large basaltic dyke is of some importance in connection\r\nwith the origin of the basic agglomerates of this locality.\r\n\r\nThe top of the mountain-ridge is about 700 feet above Nangara-ravi, or\r\n2,000 feet above the sea. The tuffs and agglomerates that once existed\r\nhere have been stripped off to a great extent and the deeper rocks of\r\nthe range are in part exposed. The upper part of this ridge (1,700 to\r\n2,000 feet) is formed of a rubbly pitchstone where a basic glass has\r\nbeen broken up and then consolidated, the interstices being filled up\r\nwith palagonite as described in other cases on page 313. Though\r\nnon-vesicular, it is just such a rock as one would expect to find on the\r\nsurface of a lava-flow or on the sides of a dyke.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the range is here only a narrow ridge. I followed it along\r\nin a north-west direction, gradually ascending on the way, and in time\r\nthe rubbly pitchstone gave place to a hardened palagonitic clay rock,\r\nwhich was observed as high as 2,300 feet. It apparently contains a\r\nlittle lime, and probably was at one time foraminiferous; but it is now\r\nmuch affected by hydration. Soon after this, we arrived at the foot of\r\nthe steep ascent leading to the summit of Va-lili. We were now rather\r\nover 2,400 feet above the sea; but my natives refused to go on, the\r\nheavy rain having made the slope too slippery for a safe ascent. With\r\nmuch reluctance I retraced my steps; and as the bad weather continued\r\nfor several days after, I did not make another attempt. There would,\r\nhowever, be no difficulty in dry weather.\r\n\r\n(2) TRAVERSE OF THE VA-LILI RANGE FROM THE OLD SITE OF LOMA-LOMA TO\r\nWAIWAI ON THE COAST OF SAVU-SAVU BAY.—This route, which was taken by Mr.\r\nHorne, the botanist, in the reverse direction in 1878, is thus described\r\nin his book, _A Year in Fiji_ (p. 19): “The path, rough and apparently\r\nnot much used, ran along streams, up steep ascents and down awkward\r\ndescents, over slippery boulders and fallen trees, up the sides and\r\nalong the crests of densely wooded mountains.”\r\n\r\nAscending the north slope of the range I found at the Tangi-nandreli\r\ncave, which is 1,050 feet above the sea, a palagonite-tuff-sandstone\r\nunderlying the basic agglomerate. This tuff, which is of the type\r\ndescribed just below, does not effervesce with an acid, and shows no\r\ntests of foraminifera when examined with a lens. Further up the slopes\r\nlarge masses of agglomerate occur. At 1,350 feet I came upon a large\r\nmass of a fine-grained compacted palagonite-tuff made up chiefly of\r\nfragments of palagonitized vacuolar basic glass. Among the mineral\r\nfragments occur plagioclase, augite, and rhombic pyroxene, and a little\r\nfresh olivine, which is of very rare occurrence in these\r\npalagonite-tuffs. It contains little or no lime, and shows no tests of\r\nforaminifera in the slide. The summit of the range is here about half a\r\nmile broad, and is relatively level. I placed its elevation at 1,760\r\nfeet, which is not far from Horne’s estimate of 1,800 feet. The southern\r\nslope, which is the rainy side of the range, is much cut up into gorges.\r\nIn the upper 200 feet palagonite-tuffs, similar to those above referred\r\nto, are displayed, and basic agglomerates occur lower down.... This part\r\nof the range is remarkable through being completely covered over by\r\npalagonite-tuffs and agglomerates. It has been pointed out above that\r\nthis is not the case with the range close to the highest peak, where the\r\nunderlying rocks are in part exposed at the crest of the range.\r\n\r\n(3) THE EASTERN PEAK OF THE VA-LILI RANGE.—This hill, about 1,100 feet\r\nin height, overlooks the Mbale-mbale branch of the Ndreke-ni-wai river.\r\nAt its foot near the river there is exposed at the roadside a rubbly\r\npitchstone formed of a basic glass, inclosing porphyritic crystals of\r\nplagioclase, augite, and olivine, which is described on page 313. Here\r\nalso occurs an agglomerate made up of blocks of a semi-vitreous basaltic\r\nandesite (sp. gr. 2·78), showing prismatic pyroxene in the groundmass,\r\nand referred to genus 20 of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the hill displays the same agglomerate, and a\r\ntuff-agglomerate in which small fragments of the basaltic andesite are\r\ninclosed in a matrix largely made up of fine debris of basic glass.\r\nThere protrudes through these detrital rocks at the top of the hill a\r\nbroad dyke-like mass of the same basaltic andesite that forms the\r\nagglomerate around; and the structure of the hill is thus displayed as\r\nthat of an old volcanic neck. It has evidently an axis of massive\r\nbasaltic rocks, more or less covered over with agglomerates and tuffs.\r\n\r\n(4) THE NAMBUNI SPUR.—This singular spur runs down to the coast between\r\nWaiwai and Wailevu; but it is partly separated by a deep gap from the\r\nmain range. It attains a height of 550 to 600 feet, and has two little\r\npeaks which the natives call Vatu-tolutolu and Vatu-tangitangiri. Its\r\nposition is shown in one of the profile-sketches of Va-lili, given on\r\npage 141. The crest of the spur is formed by a dyke-like mass, 25 to 30\r\nfeet thick, which is composed of a basic agglomerate passing down into a\r\npalagonite-tuff. The blocks of the agglomerate are composed of a\r\nsemi-vitreous basaltic andesite, showing minute felspar-lathes in\r\nflow-arrangement in an abundant smoky glass, the fine pyroxene being not\r\ndifferentiated. The tuff, into which the agglomerate passes down is\r\nnon-calcareous, and displays no organic remains. It is, however,\r\ncomposed of fragments, which do not generally exceed a millimetre in\r\nsize, of palagonitised vacuolar glass, basic andesites, plagioclase,\r\nmonoclinic and rhombic pyroxene, &c.\r\n\r\nThis dyke-like mass forms the axis of the ridge and protrudes vertically\r\nabout 100 feet, the bulk of the spur being composed of a compacted\r\nbrecciated palagonite-tuff made up mainly of fragments a centimetre in\r\nsize, of a basic vacuolar glass, sometimes fibrillar, which is\r\nextensively palagonitised.\r\n\r\nThe filling up of a fissure in a mass of tuff-breccia by\r\npalagonite-tuffs and agglomerates probably occurred during the\r\nsubmergence, the original dyke-rock having been removed by marine\r\nerosion. After the emergence the subaerial denuding agencies reshaped\r\nthe surface, and as a result of the less yielding character of the\r\nmaterials filling the fissure, they protrude as a dyke-like mass from\r\nthe crest.\r\n\r\nIn a cliff-face of the adjacent main range there are displayed an\r\nagglomerate of basaltic andesite and a pitchstone-breccia, composed\r\nof fragments of but little altered basic glass, the interstices\r\nbeing filled up with palagonite. In the case of the Kiombo flow I\r\nhave endeavoured to explain the origin of a closely similar\r\npitch-stone-breccia (page 92).\r\n\r\n(5) THE SEA-BORDER AND THE LOW-LYING DISTRICTS AT THE BASE OF THE\r\nVA-LILI RANGE.—It may be generally remarked that palagonite-tuffs and\r\nclays, often foraminiferous, prevail in these localities. Thus in the\r\nsea-border between Waiwai and the mouth of the Ndreke-ni-wai basic\r\nagglomerates are displayed where the mountains approach the coast; but\r\nfurther west a broad tract of undulating land, elevated usually 100 to\r\n300 feet, intervenes between the range and the sea-border, and here\r\ncoarse and fine palagonite-tuffs predominate.... On the north-west the\r\nforaminiferous tuffs and clays of the Ndreketi plains approach the\r\nVa-lili range in the vicinity of Vuinasanga, and extend for at least 200\r\nor 300 feet up its sides.... At the east end of the range, where the\r\nslopes descend to the plains of the Waisali valley, a little west of\r\nMbale-mbale, there are exposed bedded palagonite-tuffs, tilted up at an\r\nangle of about 20° to the south-west. They contain a little lime and\r\ndisplay microscopic tests of foraminifera, the palagonite being minutely\r\nvacuolar, the cavities also being filled with the altered glass. I\r\nnoticed those submarine deposits at an elevation of 100 feet, but\r\nprobably they reach much higher.\r\n\r\nThe inference to be drawn from the data above given concerning the\r\nVa-lili range seems clearly to be this. We have here indicated the\r\nemergence of a submarine mountain-ridge covered over with\r\npalagonite-tuffs and agglomerates, the last being uppermost. These\r\ncoverings have been in places stripped off by the denuding agencies and\r\nthe underlying massive basic rocks exposed. These rocks, however, vary\r\nmuch in texture, some being vitreous, as in the case of the pitchstones,\r\nothers hemi-crystalline as in the case of the basaltic andesites; and it\r\nis to be gathered from this and other similar indications that different\r\nsubmarine vents were formed along a fissure or fissures at the\r\nsea-bottom. No evidence of subaerial eruptions came under my notice.\r\nAfter the vents became extinct they were buried beneath the\r\npalagonite-tuffs and agglomerates. During and after the emergence the\r\ndenuding agencies reshaped the surface of the range and left but little\r\nof its original form.\r\n\r\nSince it is my object to build up a theory of the origin of the\r\nridge-mountains as I proceed with the systematic description of the\r\nisland, it will be here convenient to follow up the preceding remarks on\r\nthe Va-lili Range by a preliminary reference to the great ridge district\r\nlying east of it.\r\n\r\nWhen a panoramic view of this region is obtained, one observes a series\r\nof lofty ridges more or less parallel and running about N.W. and S.E.\r\nThere are the Va-lili, Narengali, and Sealevu ridge-mountains with\r\nlesser ridges between. The intervening valleys are elevated about 400\r\nfeet above the sea, whilst the mountains rise up to over 2,000 feet. In\r\nmany localities this configuration of the surface would be attributed\r\nmainly to subaerial denudation. In this island I will endeavour to show\r\nthat these mountain-ridges existed before the emergence. They do not owe\r\ntheir form to the rivers that flow through the valleys, though no doubt\r\nriver-erosion has brought these features into greater relief.\r\n\r\nIn Vanua Levu, as there will be frequent occasion of showing, rivers\r\noften flow in valleys that they have not made. This is especially\r\npointed out on page 151; and it is necessary to emphasise it here,\r\nbefore proceeding farther with the description of the geological\r\nstructure of the mountain-ridges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE WAISALI SADDLE\r\n\r\nThis saddle, which connects the Va-lili and the Koro-tini ranges, has\r\nprobably a minimum elevation of not over 1,200 or 1,300 feet. To\r\nunderstand this district thoroughly a regular survey is, however,\r\nnecessary. It is only at times in this densely wooded range that a view\r\nof the surrounding country is obtained; but in spite of this drawback I\r\nwas able by a diligent use of watch, aneroid, and prismatic compass, to\r\nobtain a fair general notion of the surface-configuration.\r\n\r\nThe track that proceeds westward from Waisali to Narengali leads also to\r\nthe villages of Na Sinu and Sealevu. About 1½ or 2 miles from Waisali,\r\nthe track branches off to the westward for Narengali and to the\r\nnorthward for Na Sinu and Sealevu. After half an hour’s walk along this\r\nlast-named path, one comes to a place where at an elevation of about 900\r\nfeet it branches off to the left for Na Sinu, crossing the lowest part\r\nof the saddle, and to the right for Sealevu across the Koro-tini Range.\r\nIt may here be remarked that since the natives are gradually abandoning\r\ntheir mountain-villages and are settling at the coast, many of the\r\nmountain-tracks used by me will before long be overgrown and forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn taking the path from Waisali to Narengali one soon enters the hilly\r\ncountry where large masses of basic tuffs and basic agglomerates, the\r\nlast formed of blocks of a compact basaltic andesite, occur on the\r\nsurface up to 700 or 750 feet above the sea. The rock just named has a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·84, and since it displays rhombic pyroxene amongst\r\nits phenocrysts, it is placed in genus 1 of the hypersthene-augite\r\nandesites. Above this elevation, and as far as the top of the range,\r\n1,800-1,900 feet above the sea, porphyritic basaltic andesites, having a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·8, prevail at the surface. They display small\r\nporphyritic crystals of plagioclase, augite, and rhombic pyroxene in a\r\ngroundmass composed of small felspar-lathes, prismatic pyroxene, and\r\nmuch smoky glass, and are referred to genus 5 of the same pyroxene\r\nandesites. It is probable, judging from one of these exposures, that\r\nsuch rocks are dyke-like masses: but on account of the thick soil-cap it\r\nis not possible to obtain a good view of them.\r\n\r\nIn the stream-courses occur large blocks of altered basaltic andesites\r\nof the propylitic type, having a specific gravity of 2·64 to 2·70, and\r\nexhibiting abundant alteration products, such as calcite, viridite, &c.\r\nThese propylites, I presume, constitute the deeper portion of the range.\r\nIt will often be necessary to distinguish between the altered basaltic\r\nandesites, such as are above referred to, and the relatively fresh rocks\r\nof the same type. The former are light coloured (sp. gr. 2·6 to 2·75),\r\nand are only exposed in gorges and stream-courses that deeply score the\r\nmountain-slopes. The latter are blackish (sp. gr. about 2·8), and at\r\ntimes penetrate the covering of tuffs and agglomerates.\r\n\r\nDescending the opposite or north-west side of the saddle-range, one\r\nfinds the same basic andesites, both fresh and altered, down to about\r\n1,100 feet above the sea. Then the track leads one down a precipitous\r\nslope into the picturesque gorge traversed by the head-waters of the\r\nNarengali River. At its lower end the gorge opens out into the broad\r\nNarengali valley, and here the dense forest of the higher districts\r\ngives place to the scanty vegetation of the “talasinga” region.\r\n\r\nThe rocks exposed in the sides of the gorge are basic agglomerates\r\noverlying palagonitic tuffs of mixed composition and evidently\r\nsedimentary. On the bottom lie huge masses, some of them 70 or 80 tons\r\nin weight, of altered grey aphanitic or non-porphyritic\r\naugite-andesites, penetrated in some cases by thin veins of white\r\nquartz, and at times displaying a rudely columnar structure, the columns\r\nbeing 12 to 14 inches across. Sometimes the alteration is mainly\r\nconfined to the filling of the fissures with chalcedonic quartz, minute\r\nnests of the same material occurring in the groundmass. At other times\r\nthe small augite granules are also decomposing. The specific gravity\r\nvaries from 2·64 to 2·73; the rocks being referred to genus 16, species\r\nA, of the augite-andesites. Occasional detached masses of a propylitic\r\nbasic andesite, displaying porphyritic plagioclase and pyroxene, also\r\noccur in this gorge, the felspar phenocrysts being largely occupied by\r\ncalcitic and other alteration products, whilst much viridite occurs in\r\nthe groundmass. It exhibits both monoclinic and rhombic pyroxene; and on\r\naccount of the prism form of the groundmass pyroxene it is placed in the\r\n2nd sub-order of the hypersthene-augite andesites. These altered rocks\r\nare deep-seated intrusive masses that were originally covered over by\r\nthe basic agglomerates and palagonite-tuffs exposed in the sides of the\r\ngorge.\r\n\r\nBelow the gorge there is an extensive exposure in the sides and bed of\r\nthe river of light-coloured calcareous tuffs which were originally\r\ncomposed of palagonitic materials; but owing partly to hydration, and\r\npartly to other secondary changes, the original structure is much\r\ndisguised.\r\n\r\nCrossing the river in the midst of these tuffs there is a dyke, 15 feet\r\nthick, formed of a propylitic basaltic andesite, a semi-vitreous rock in\r\nwhich calcitic and zeolitic materials have been developed in quantity.\r\nThe dyke, which is not columnar, is steeply inclined at an angle of 45°\r\nto the north-east.... Further down the river-valley as far as Narengali,\r\noccur basic tuff-agglomerates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE TRACT OF NAKAMBUTA\r\n\r\nThis is a tract of broken country that projects from the mountainous\r\nbackbone of the island (between the Va-lili and Koro-tini ranges) into\r\nthe heart of the Ndreketi plains in the vicinity of Natua. As limited by\r\nthe 300-feet contour line, it is indicated in the map attached to this\r\nwork. Its general level varies between 300 and 600 feet in elevation;\r\nbut a number of isolated peaks are included within this area. More than\r\none of these hills attain a height of 1,000 feet, Nakambuta a very\r\nconspicuous hill being as much as 1,500 feet. Basaltic andesites with\r\nbasic agglomerates and palagonite-tuffs prevail.\r\n\r\nTowards Natua the basaltic andesites, which are often much decomposed,\r\nare of the doleritic type referred to in the account of the Ndreketi\r\nPlains on page 133. Inland, towards Narengali and Va-lili, these rocks\r\nare often more or less glassy and take the form of pitchstones; whilst\r\nthe agglomerates have the same character. The first probably represent\r\nsubmarine flows of basaltic lava which have spread far and wide over the\r\nNdreketi plains. The inland rocks are, as is pointed out below, the\r\nproducts of vents that, as in the case no doubt of Mount Nakambuta, rose\r\nout of a shallow sea. The palagonite-tuffs and clays, often\r\nforaminiferous, which cover the Ndreketi plains, are extensively\r\nrepresented in the lower levels up to 400 feet or more.\r\n\r\nBetween one and two miles to the westward of the Narengali valley, and\r\nimmediately north of Va-lili, the agglomerates, overlying\r\npalagonite-tuffs, form lofty precipices. The agglomerates are composed\r\nof blocks of more or less vitreous basaltic-andesites, some of them\r\nsemi-vitreous and amygdaloidal, some in the form of pitchstone, and\r\nothers again as tachylyte that fuses in the lamp-flame. The underlying\r\npalagonite-tuffs are bedded, and are composed of fragments of basic\r\nglass that originally inclosed porphyritic crystals of plagioclase. In\r\nthe slide it is observed that the glass and mineral fragments have often\r\nbeen re-fractured as they lie in the tuff and that the former have\r\nrounded angles and eroded edges. The interstices are filled with a more\r\nor less palagonitised magma. Similar rocks occur in other localities,\r\nand they will all be found described on page 334. It may, however, be\r\nremarked here that in all cases these rocks would seem to have undergone\r\nsome crushing, the heat developed in the process being sufficient to\r\npartially remelt the glass. A high temperature was not required to\r\neffect this fusion, since splinters of the tachylyte occurring in the\r\noverlying agglomerate fuse in an ordinary lamp-flame. It is pointed out\r\non page 341 that tuffs of this character differ in origin and in\r\ncharacters from the prevailing foraminiferous palagonite-tuffs.\r\n\r\nThe road from Narengali to Natua traverses the length of this district.\r\nAt and near the mouth of the Narengali valley there are exposed basic\r\ntuffs and agglomerates, the blocks in the last case being formed of a\r\nsemi-vitreous, vesicular or almost scoriaceous basaltic andesite. In\r\nthis neighbourhood the track passes across the top of a waterfall which\r\nis the result of the existence of a huge dyke-like mass of a compact\r\nbasaltic andesite showing a little interstitial glass and referred to\r\ngenus 13 of the augite-andesites. It lies in a district of tuffs and\r\nagglomerates. Farther on, about two miles north-west of Narengali, the\r\ntrack crosses some rounded hills, elevated about 600 feet, on the top of\r\nwhich is displayed a concretionary pitchstone, showing little nodular\r\nconcretions of the size of filberts, and having the microscopical\r\ncharacters of “variolite,” as described on page 313. This is the only\r\nlocality of this rock that is known to me.\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with the tract of Nakambuta is, however, very imperfect.\r\nBut it is apparent that in the pitchstones and in the semi-vitreous\r\nbasic rocks, sometimes vesicular and amygdaloidal, we get a nearer\r\napproach to the products of subaerial eruptions than is to be observed\r\nin most other portions of the island. The examination of the Nakambuta\r\npeak by some future investigator will bring to light some interesting\r\nfacts concerning this region. It is not unlikely that during a late\r\nstage of the emergence of this region Nakambuta and the other peaks\r\naround protruded as active vents above the surface of a shallow sea, at\r\nthe bottom of which the products of their eruptions accumulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE VALLEY OF THE NDREKE-NI-WAI AND ITS TRIBUTARIES\r\n\r\nNdreke-ni-wai, which signifies “the hollow of the water,” is the name of\r\na broad tidal estuary, opening into Savu-savu Bay, which is formed by\r\nthe union, about half a mile above its mouth, of two rivers, the\r\nMbale-mbale River flowing from the north-west past a village of that\r\nname, and the Vatu-kawa River, the largest, flowing from the eastward,\r\nwhich I have also named after a village on its banks. The valleys of\r\nthese two rivers are separated by a mountainous dividing-ridge connected\r\nby a saddle with the main range. Its highest peaks rise to 2,100 feet\r\nabove the sea, the elevation of this “divide” rapidly decreasing as it\r\napproaches the coast, where, within a mile of the beach, it terminates\r\nin some low hills 200 or 300 feet in height.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed here that a mouth of the river was originally\r\nsituated 700 or 800 yards to the west of its present site. This old\r\nmouth is now represented by a lagoon communicating with the Mbale-mbale\r\nRiver above, but closed by the sand-mound of the beach at its lower end,\r\nwhich, however, is occasionally broken through when the rivers are in\r\nflood. This lagoon is shown in the view facing page 153.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Mbale-mbale River, which is much the smaller of the\r\ntwo rivers, is bounded on the north by the precipitous slopes of the\r\nKoro-tini Range, which rise to over 2,000 feet, and on the south and\r\nwest by the lofty Va-lili Range. The valley, above the village of\r\nMbale-mbale, is broad and low-lying; and one can ascend it to the\r\nvicinity of Waisali, three to four miles from the river’s mouth, without\r\nattaining an elevation of 100 feet above the sea. The main stream, which\r\nflows down from Waisali, is joined near Mbale-mbale by a more impetuous\r\nstream that descends the steep mountain-sides just to the east of the\r\nKoro-tini Bluff.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Vatu-kawa River is bounded by lofty mountain-ranges\r\nthat rise to elevations varying from 2,000 to 3,500 feet. On the south\r\nside lies the Mariko Range, on the east lies Mount Mbatini, the most\r\nelevated peak of the island, whilst on the north rise up the steep\r\nslopes of the Koro-tini Range and of the mountainous “divide.” The\r\nvalley has such a gentle gradient that one can follow it inland for five\r\nor six miles from the estuary to the vicinity of Nukumbolo without\r\nexceeding an elevation of 100 feet above the sea. Below Na Salia the\r\nvalley is confined between the hills that approach the river; but above\r\nthat village it is very broad; and on account of its slight fall the\r\nriver here often changes its course, so that the floor of the valley is\r\nstrewn with water-worn blocks and pebbles marking the old channels.\r\n\r\nThe Vatu-kawa River, which rises on the west slopes of Mbatini, flows\r\nwith a placid current past Nukumbolo and Na Salia, until it reaches the\r\nvillage of Vatu-kawa, where it is joined by its impetuous tributary, the\r\nWai-ni-ngio, “the river of the shark.” This affluent, after descending\r\nthe steep slopes of the Koro-tini mountains, bursts through the dividing\r\nrange that separates the Mbale-mbale and the Vatu-kawa valleys. It would\r\nseem that the Wai-ni-ngio without any great effort on its part might\r\nbecome a tributary of the Mbale-mbale River.\r\n\r\nThe great character of these two valleys, as shown above, is their\r\nlittle elevation above the sea. For miles inland the level does not\r\nattain 100 feet, and high ranges rise steeply in each case on either\r\nside to 2,000 feet and over. Here, as in the instance of most of the\r\nlarge valleys of the island, the original configuration of the surface\r\nwas not dependent on river-erosion. Rivers no doubt have done much to\r\ncarve out the lesser and to deepen and widen the greater valleys; but,\r\nas is often remarked in this work, the main features of the surface were\r\nin existence before the emergence of the island from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe geological formation of the slopes of these two valleys is described\r\nin the accounts of the various ascents of the mountains bounding them.\r\nSince foraminiferous tuffs occur high up their sides, up to elevations\r\nof 2,000 feet and over, the valleys themselves were at one time no doubt\r\nalso covered with these submarine deposits, which, however, have been in\r\ngreat part stripped off by the denuding agencies. They are still to be\r\nfound, containing large tests of foraminifera, between Mbale-mbale and\r\nWaisali; but the basaltic andesites, originally underlying them, are\r\nmore frequently exposed. One of these rocks found a little east of\r\nWaisali, which has an aphanitic appearance and a specific gravity of\r\n2·82, is merely a basic glass in its early stage of crystallisation,\r\nbeing made up of very minute crystallites 1/5000 of an inch in length.\r\nOn the surface in this locality there also occur basic agglomerates\r\ncontaining scoriaceous rocks, the products of some of the last stages of\r\nvolcanic action in this part of the island.... In the case of the broad\r\npart of the Vatu-kawa valley above Na Salia blocks of basic rocks\r\nderived from the mountains around strew the bottom in great abundance.\r\nLower down, where the valley is confined between the hills, basic\r\nagglomerates and coarse tuffs are displayed in the hill-sides.\r\n\r\nMention should be made here of the various hot springs existing in these\r\nvalleys in the low levels near the rivers and stream-courses. In the\r\nVatu-kawa valley they exist at Nukumbolo, and in the Mbale-mbale valley\r\nat Natoarau, Waitunutunu and other localities. These springs are\r\ndescribed in Chapter III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUNIUA LAGOON, representing an old mouth of the\r\nNdreke-ni-wai. Behind rises the Korotini Tableland (2,000-3,000 feet).\r\nThe cliff-like declivity over the head of the lagoon is the Korotini\r\nBluff.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE KORO-TINI RANGE OR TABLE-LAND\r\n\r\nTHE level-topped range that forms the mountainous backbone of the island\r\nfor a distance of nearly 10 miles is one of the remarkable features of\r\nVanua Levu.[66] In the general profile of the island it is named the\r\nKoro-tini Table-land on account of the level profile which it presents\r\nwhether viewed from the north or from the south. But this is merely its\r\nappearance _en masse_. When it is examined in detail it is found that\r\nalthough much of the range has an elevation between 2,000 and 2,400 feet\r\nabove the sea, it attains an elevation of about 3,000 feet in the case\r\nof two gently sloping peaks. With regard also to its table-top, it is\r\nnecessary to remark that whilst in some portions of the range the summit\r\nis broad and level, in others it is much cut up into ridges, and in\r\nothers again it presents a single narrow crest. Nor can we realise on\r\nlooking at the profile the extent to which its slopes have been carved\r\nout by river-erosion, and we get no indication of the several lofty\r\nspurs that descend north and south far into the plains, as in the case\r\nof the spur west of Sueni and in that terminating in the Koro-tini\r\nBluff. In the profile the eye ignores the details with which the\r\ninvestigator during many toilsome ascents has filled the pages of his\r\nnote-books. To this extent it is useful in that it enables him to rise a\r\nlittle above the level of his facts, and permits him (to employ a\r\nfigure-of-speech) to regard the style and general character of the\r\nedifice without being exclusively absorbed in the study of the bricks.\r\n\r\nThis range, which extends from a mile or two west of Sealevu to a couple\r\nof miles east of Sueni, is connected on the west with the Va-lili Range\r\nby the Waisali Saddle before described, and on the east with the\r\nThambeyu or Mount Thurston Range by a broken chain of mountains, of\r\nwhich Koro-mbasanga is the most conspicuous. It is connected by an\r\nelevated _col_ with Mount Mbatini and the Mariko Range to the southward.\r\nThe name of Koro-tini has been applied to this range because it is\r\nfamiliar to the natives. It signifies “ten towns,” and was given to a\r\nonce populous district on the slopes of the lofty bluff overlooking on\r\nthe north the mouth of the Ndreke-ni-wai. I crossed the range in four\r\nplaces, namely, between Waisali and Sealevu, between Mbale-mbale and\r\nVandrani, between Vatu-kawa and Vandrani, and between Nukumbolo and\r\nSueni.\r\n\r\n(1) TRAVERSE OF THE KORO-TINI RANGE FROM WAISALI TO SEALEVU.—Starting\r\nfrom Waisali by the Narengali track, I ascended the east slope of the\r\nWaisali Saddle, as described on page 146, until an elevation of about\r\n750 feet was reached, when my way lay to the northward across the\r\nKoro-tini Range to Sealevu. At 850 feet a singular altered tuff was\r\ndisplayed in position in a stream-course. It shows calcite and pyrites,\r\nand is interesting from the fact that although it is made up largely of\r\nbasic glass the tuff does not seem to have undergone the palagonitic\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, there was a fairly steep ascent to the summit of the range,\r\n2,400 feet above the sea, which has merely a ridge-like crest. Between\r\nan elevation of 1,400 feet and the top there are exposed at the surface\r\ncompacted coarse and fine palagonite-tuffs and agglomerate-tuffs formed\r\nof the same materials. They contain often abundant organic remains, such\r\nas valves of “Cardium” and “Pecten” shells, macroscopic tests of\r\nForaminifera, and some curious scale-like bodies, showing a concentric\r\nstructure and about an inch across, which look like fish-scales. It is\r\nprobable that these interesting rocks extend to a greater elevation than\r\n2,400 feet, which was merely the highest level reached in the traverse,\r\nbut is not the highest point of the range.\r\n\r\nThese deposits are made up in mass of a more or less palagonitised basic\r\nglass originally containing phenocrysts of plagioclase and pyroxene. The\r\npalagonitic process is nearly always far advanced; but it is seen in all\r\nits stages, the least altered materials fusing under the blow-pipe into\r\na black glass. The fragments are usually sub-angular in the case of the\r\ncoarse tuffs; but small rounded pebbles up to half an inch in size and\r\nfine water-worn gravel are not infrequent. The matrix is composed of\r\npalagonitic debris, portions of crystals of plagioclase and pyroxene,\r\nfine gravel, occasional tests of foraminifera; and it often contains a\r\nfair amount of carbonate of lime, in one specimen tested as much as 13\r\nper cent. The amount of lime, however, varies, being in some places\r\nscanty.\r\n\r\nThe term “conglomerate” could not be applied to the coarser deposits,\r\nsince the sub-angular and angular fragments always predominate. They\r\ncould scarcely be deemed “breccias” on account of the mixture with\r\npebbles and gravel. Their character is therefore intermediate between\r\nthe two. I have used the expression “agglomerate-tuff” because it best\r\ndescribes their appearance. A specimen of such a rock presents a curious\r\nmixture, in the well-compacted mass, of angular and sub-rounded\r\nfragments of palagonite up to an inch in size, small pebbles and fine\r\ngravel of the same material, and detached valves of “Cardium,” entire\r\nand broken. One is forced to draw the inference that these materials\r\naccumulated in shallow water. They are such as might have been produced\r\nby the marine erosion of an emerging volcanic island endeavouring to\r\nhold its own above the waves. But from the occasional occurrence of\r\nblocks of a scoriaceous basaltic rock it would appear that during the\r\nformation of the deposits there were periods of eruption.\r\n\r\nAt times massive and comparatively fresh-looking basaltic rocks are\r\nexposed _in situ_ on the mountain sides in the midst of these submarine\r\ndeposits. A specimen obtained at 1,800 feet is a semi-ophitic\r\nporphyritic olivine-basalt with a specific gravity of 2·86 and showing a\r\nlittle interstitial glass. The mode of exposure did not admit of my\r\nascertaining the exact relation of these rocks to the deposits. They are\r\nno doubt dyke-like masses representing the original fissures of eruption\r\nof a submarine vent; and during the emergence they were covered up with\r\ntuffs and deposits, the work of the marine erosion of the emerging land.\r\nThese, however, are points on which light will be thrown when we come to\r\nexamine other localities.\r\n\r\nDescending the northern slopes of the range from the summit to Sealevu\r\nthe general course was N.N.E. Several valleys were crossed, of which\r\nthat occupied by the Na Sinu river was 600 feet in depth, the rivers and\r\nstreams all flowing to the north-west into the Ndreketi basin. Basic\r\ntuffs and agglomerates were exposed at the surface all the way down to\r\nSealevu, 400 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Sealevu valley, about a mile or rather more above the\r\nvillage, and a little east of the track followed in the descent above\r\ndescribed, the mountain-range terminates abruptly in lofty cliffs 400 or\r\n500 feet in height. At their base, which is about 1,000 feet above the\r\nsea, once stood the village of Lovutu. These cliffs are formed of basic\r\nagglomerate-tuffs which display a horizontal arrangement, but there is\r\nno distinct bedding. They have the castellated appearance that often\r\ncharacterises horizontally bedded sedimentary formations. The inclosed\r\nrock-fragments vary in size from 18 inches to half an inch and smaller.\r\nThe larger are angular or sub-angular, and are composed of\r\nhemicrystalline basaltic andesites, scoriaceous and vesicular and\r\nsometimes amygdaloidal. The smaller fragments are more or less rounded\r\nand of the same material. The matrix is made up of fine detritus of the\r\nlarge fragments and of lapilli of a vacuolar palagonitic basic glass,\r\nwhilst small crystals of calcite fill the cavities and line the\r\nfissures. The phenocrysts of plagioclase and augite inclosed in the\r\naltered glass also display extensive alteration, and in the first case\r\nare largely replaced by calcite, secondary quartz, and other products.\r\nNo organic remains came under my notice; but on account of the\r\nalteration of the tuff-matrix their preservation could hardly be\r\nexpected. Bearing in mind, however, the fossiliferous character of the\r\ntuffs and agglomerates in the higher part of the range, it can scarcely\r\nbe doubted that the agglomerate-tuffs of the Sealevu cliffs are also\r\nsubmarine.\r\n\r\nEach traverse of the great Koro-tini Range will provide us with new\r\nfacts to aid us in framing an explanation of the origin of this long\r\nmountain-ridge. The principal lesson to be learned from the journey\r\nacross the range from Waisali to Sealevu, and from the visit to the\r\ncliffs, is concerned with the great extent and thickness of these\r\nsubmarine basic tuffs and agglomerates. From 1,000 feet above the sea up\r\nto the summit, 2,400 feet in height, they are almost the only rocks\r\nexposed, excepting the occasional masses of basaltic rocks, which\r\nprobably represent dykes. Their maximum thickness must amount to some\r\nhundreds of feet.\r\n\r\n(2) TRAVERSE OF THE KORO-TINI RANGE FROM MBALE-MBALE TO VANDRANI.—In\r\nthis traverse the track before ascending to the summit crosses a spur of\r\nthe Koro-tini Bluff, and then descends into the valley of the Natoarau\r\nriver on the east side of it. It will therefore be convenient to\r\ndescribe the bluff before giving my description of the journey across\r\nthe range.\r\n\r\nThe Koro-tini Bluff is a lofty headland (if I may so term it), lying\r\nabout four miles inland from the mouth of the Ndreke-ni-wai. It attains\r\nan elevation of about 2,000 feet, and terminates above in a line of\r\nprecipices 300 or 400 feet in height. It represents the southern edge of\r\nthe level-topped mountain range behind, and like the Sealevu cliffs on\r\nthe north side it affords a natural section of its mass. It is shown in\r\nthe plate facing page 153, where it rises at the back of the lagoon.\r\n\r\nApproaching the bluff from Mbale-mbale, one crosses a low-lying district\r\nless than 100 feet above the sea before striking the spur. Here and in\r\nthe lower few hundred feet of the spur are exposed basic agglomerates,\r\nand occasionally in the mass a semi-vitreous vesicular olivine-basalt,\r\nalmost like a pitchstone, and displaying large porphyritic crystals of\r\nplagioclase, 5 or 6 millimetres long, the agglomerates being made up of\r\nthe same material. Higher up, at elevations between 1,000 and 1,500\r\nfeet, are exposed coarse palagonite-tuffs made up of fragments, usually\r\n1 to 3 mm. in size, of extensively palagonitised basic vitreous rocks,\r\nsuch as occur in the cliffs above. These tuffs become coarser as one\r\napproaches the precipitous bluff, the base of which lies about 1,650\r\nfeet above the sea. Here the cliffs present a bare rocky face, some 200\r\nfeet high. The lower portion is composed of an agglomerate-tuff, and the\r\nupper portion mainly of agglomerates. These deposits display no bedding\r\nexcepting a single plane of division inclined steeply to the north at an\r\nangle of perhaps 40°.\r\n\r\nThe blocks in the agglomerate-tuff are either angular or sub-angular,\r\nand are less than a foot across. They are all composed of more or less\r\nvitreous porphyritic olivine-basalts, showing large crystals of\r\nplagioclase a fifth of an inch (5 or 6 mm.) in length. But they vary\r\nsomewhat in character. Some of them, that are vesicular and almost\r\nscoriaceous, may be termed from their glassy nature porphyritic\r\npitchstones. Others again, where the groundmass is hemi-crystalline, may\r\nbe designated porphyritic compact basalts, and are referred to genus 37\r\nof the olivine-basalts.\r\n\r\nThe matrix of the agglomerate-tuff is made up of angular fragments, up\r\nto 5 mm. in size, of singular vitreous and semi-vitreous\r\nolivine-basalts, in part palagonitised. There is evidence of crushing\r\n_in situ_ of some of the porphyritic felspar crystals; but it is not so\r\nmarked as elsewhere noticed. The palagonite is also in part\r\ninterstitial, a character that goes to support the view advanced on page\r\n342, that the palagonite may be connected in its origin with the heat\r\ndeveloped during crushing, only a moderate temperature being required\r\nfor the partial fusion of the glass.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the range by this route from Mbale-mbale one first ascends,\r\nas above observed, the spur of the Koro-tini Bluff up to a height of\r\n1,200 feet. The track then descends into the valley-gorge of the\r\nNatoarau river on the east, the bottom of which is 750 feet above the\r\nsea, and from here the climb begins. One ascends the bed of the stream\r\ncourse, clambering over slippery rock surfaces up to 1,200 or 1,300\r\nfeet, where the stream is left, and the mountain-slopes, often steep and\r\nprecipitous, are then followed to the summit, 2,000 feet in height.\r\nCoarse and fine palagonite-tuffs and agglomerate-tuffs of the same\r\ncharacter are exposed on the surface from the commencement of the ascent\r\nup to 1,850 feet; but they are displayed much more extensively in the\r\nstream-course than in the soil-covered upper slopes.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs are grey except when hydrated, when they turn yellowish-brown.\r\nSome of them contain lime, as much at times as 10 or 12 per cent.;\r\nwhilst others possess little or none. Tests of foraminifera are not\r\ninfrequently inclosed, even as high as 1,850 feet. A description of one\r\nof these tuffs containing a few tests of Globigerina, which was obtained\r\nat 1,200 feet, is given on page 331, under sample D. It will be there\r\nseen that they are derived from different basic rocks, some containing\r\nbut little glass, others mainly vitreous, only the more glassy\r\nconstituents being palagonitised. The palagonite-tuff sandstones exposed\r\nin large blocks on a bare spur at 1,850 feet contain 12 per cent. of\r\nlime, the largest tests of foraminifera being not over half a\r\nmillimetre.[67] These tuffs occasionally show bedding. At 1,000 feet\r\nthey dip gently to the S.S.W., and at 750 feet they are inclined about\r\n15° in the same direction. In this last locality they consist of\r\nalternating layers, 1 to 4 inches in thickness, of fine and coarse\r\ntuffs, the coarser looking like sandstone.... The blocks in the\r\nagglomerate-tuff are sub-angular, and of an olivine-basalt with\r\nhemi-crystalline groundmass,[68] their size ranging from 2 feet to an\r\ninch. I noticed one large block of this rock, measuring 2 × 1½ × 1 feet,\r\nimbedded alone in the tuffs at 1,200 feet. At one place a tuff\r\ncontaining small fragments of basalt displayed a concretionary\r\nstructure, indicating probably the proximity of a dyke, the globular\r\nmasses being 4 feet across. A little lime occurs in the matrix of the\r\nagglomerate-tuff.\r\n\r\nThe summit of the range, 2,000 feet in height, is “ridgy,” about half a\r\nmile in width, and cannot therefore be described as table-topped. The\r\nrocks exposed in blocks on the surface are composed of a semi-ophitic\r\nolivine-basalt containing a large amount of interstitial glass which\r\nshows the fibrous crystallites of the early stage devitrification. It is\r\nreferred to genus 33 of the olivine-basalts.\r\n\r\nDescending the northern side of the range I followed the steep slopes\r\ndown to 1,000 feet above the sea. A rubbly doleritic olivine-basalt,\r\nsemi-ophitic, and assigned to the same genus (33), prevailed on the way;\r\nand it is probable that a waterfall with a drop of 50 feet or more that\r\nis situated on these slopes indicates a large intrusive mass of this\r\nrock. During the rest of the descent to Vandrani, which lies in a valley\r\nat the foot of the range, and is elevated about 300 feet above the sea,\r\nbasic agglomerates and palagonite-tuffs, together with deposits\r\nintermediate in character, were exposed at the surface. At times a\r\nsemi-ophitic doleritic basalt similar to those displayed above, but\r\nwithout olivine, occurred in position. The blocks in the agglomerates\r\nare formed of a compact semi-vitreous basaltic rock, and are sometimes\r\nvesicular. At one place the palagonite-tuffs exhibited signs of\r\nalteration, being traversed by small fissures not over a third of an\r\ninch broad (5 to 8 mm.), and filled with a zeolite behaving like\r\nnatrolite.\r\n\r\nIn some cliffs by the river at Vandrani are displayed fine and coarse\r\nnon-calcareous palagonite-tuffs, bedded and dipping about 15° N. by W.\r\nThey are penetrated by cracks, 5 mm. in breadth, which are filled with\r\nchalcedony. These tuffs are evidently in part derived from acid as well\r\nas from basic rocks, though mainly from the latter; and they show other\r\nalteration-characters. At the mouth of the Vandrani valley there are\r\nexposed in the river-bed coarse palagonite-tuff sandstones containing a\r\nlittle lime, and probably a few tests of foraminifera.\r\n\r\nReference may here be made to the mountain of Ravi-koro which, when seen\r\nfrom the north-east, rises up as a partially independent peak, with a\r\nbroad base and a conical truncated summit, immediately west of the track\r\nfollowed in the descent from the summit of the range to Vandrani. It is\r\nprobably not much under 2,000 feet in height, and exhibits bare\r\nprecipitous cliff-faces on the north side. It would be worthy of the\r\nattention of the future investigator.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the principal features of the range between Mbale-mbale and\r\nVandrani, one may remark the extensive occurrence of basic agglomerates\r\nand tuffs on both slopes, the prevalence of olivine-basalts, the\r\nfrequency of the semi-vitreous and vitreous or rather pitchstone\r\ncondition of these rocks, and their semi-ophitic character, especially\r\non the summit and north slopes. From the vesicular structure of the\r\nrocks of the Koro-tini Bluff and from the character of its tuffs and\r\nagglomerates, it is to be inferred that they are the direct products of\r\neruptions, probably in shallow seas. On the other hand, the tuffs (often\r\nforaminiferous) as well as the agglomerate-tuffs of the north and south\r\nslopes of the range are in part suggestive of marine erosion. Intrusive\r\nmasses of basalt are to be observed occasionally, and doubtless to this\r\ncause may be attributed the concretionary structure of the tuffs in\r\nplaces, and the alteration of these deposits in one or two localities,\r\nwhere they are penetrated by cracks filled with chalcedony.\r\n\r\n(3) TRAVERSE OF THE KORO-TINI RANGE FROM VATU-KAWA TO VANDRANI.—On\r\nleaving Vatu-kawa[69], which is not more than 50 feet above the sea, the\r\nascent for the first 600 feet up the steep mountain-side lies along the\r\nrocky bed of the Wai-ni-ngio River, which from its rapid fall has more\r\nthe character of a torrent. On its sides are exposed basic agglomerates\r\nand agglomerate-tuffs; whilst the large boulders in its bed are composed\r\nof a somewhat altered olivine-basalt. At 600 feet the track abandons the\r\nstream-course for the steep mountain slopes, and thence up to 1,100 feet\r\nsimilar agglomerates and tuffs prevail. At this last-named elevation\r\nthere are displayed fine and coarse indurated palagonite-tuffs, a little\r\naltered in character and with little or no lime. A specimen of the\r\nformer, of which the materials composing it do not exceed ·2 mm. in\r\nsize, shows in the slide an occasional “Globigerina” test filled with\r\npalagonitic debris. Such a marine deposit is evidently not of\r\nshallow-water origin. The coarser tuff is made up of compacted\r\nsub-angular fragments, not over 2 mm. in size; but contains no organic\r\nremains. The prevailing rocks exposed between 1,100 and 1,900 feet, a\r\nlittle below the summit of the range, are somewhat altered compacted\r\nnon-calcareous breccia-tuffs, composed of sub-angular fragments 5 or\r\n6 mm. in size, of a more or less glassy and often vacuolar basic or\r\nbasaltic andesite, only in part palagonitised, the vacuoles as well as\r\nthe interstices between the fragments being sometimes filled with a\r\nzeolite.[70]\r\n\r\nThe summit of the range may be described as a “ridgy” table-land. Though\r\nabout 2 miles in breadth, its level only varies between 2,000 and 2,200\r\nfeet, the inequalities being probably the effect of denudation. Here, as\r\nin many other similar localities, on account of the dense forest it was\r\nonly possible to determine the surface-configuration by the use of\r\ncompass, watch and aneroid. The prevailing rocks displayed in this\r\nregion are grey non-calcareous basic tuffs, somewhat altered in\r\ncharacter, and composed of fragments usually not exceeding 1 mm. in size\r\nof a basic glass, the palagonitic process being masked by other changes.\r\nThese tuffs often become brownish-yellow through hydration. Tests of\r\nforaminifera are enclosed, but they are very scanty.\r\n\r\nOn the north slopes basic agglomerates and palagonite-tuffs are the\r\npredominant rocks down to the foot of the range. A specimen of the tuffs\r\ntaken at 1,300 feet is calcareous in patches and probably contains tests\r\nof foraminifera; but it is too much weathered to enable one to speak\r\nwith certainty on this point. The interesting feature of this slope is\r\nthe exposure at 1,600 to 1,700 feet of large blocks of a dark grey\r\nhypersthene-augite andesite referred to the orthophyric order of those\r\nrocks described on page 290. Lower down (1,000-1,300 feet) occasional\r\nsolitary blocks of the same rock, but somewhat altered, occur imbedded\r\nin the palagonite-tuff. This type of rock which is characterised by the\r\northophyric structure of the groundmass and by other features is rarely\r\nrepresented in Vanua Levu.\r\n\r\nSumming up the general results of this traverse we observe that here, as\r\nin other parts of the range, basic agglomerates, breccias, and tuffs,\r\nthe last however scantily foraminiferous, occupy a great extent of the\r\nslopes and summit. The alteration of these deposits on the southern\r\nslopes is noteworthy. The only deeper seated massive rocks observed were\r\nthe pyroxene-andesites above alluded to.\r\n\r\n(4) TRAVERSE OF THE KORO-TINI RANGE FROM NUKUMBOLO TO SUENI.—The hot\r\nsprings at Nukumbolo, which are described on page 24, rise up through\r\nagglomerate-tuffs. Around the bathing pools lie large masses of altered\r\npalagonite-tuffs which give the first indication of the region of\r\naltered rocks that extends from Nukumbolo to the lower slopes of the\r\nrange, a distance of about three miles.\r\n\r\nFor about a mile and a half or two miles from this place the track lies\r\nthrough a broken country and does not rise to a height more than 300\r\nfeet above the sea. A variety of altered rocks are here exposed in\r\nposition in the stream courses. Some of them are fine and coarse basic\r\ntuffs showing secondary calcite, quartz and opal, as alteration\r\nproducts. Others are palagonite-breccias with the vacuoles of the\r\naltered glass filled with opal. Others again are massive basic rocks,\r\nsuch as fine-textured augite-andesites, or doleritic basaltic andesites,\r\nsemi-ophitic in character, the plagioclase phenocrysts being more or\r\nless occupied by calcitic and other products. The alteration is not\r\nalways far advanced, but it is sufficiently marked to give a common\r\ncharacter to the rocks of the district.\r\n\r\nAscending the lower slopes of the range up to 800 feet one finds the\r\naltered rocks still exposed in the stream-courses; but the changes\r\nexhibited are not always the same. A specimen from 500 feet looks like a\r\ntuff, but in the slide it appears as a semi-vitreous augite-andesite,\r\nits substance being penetrated by fine veins of chalcedonic quartz and\r\nopal, whilst the same material is developed within the larger\r\nplagioclase crystals. Another specimen from 800 feet, which is\r\napparently a tuff, contains so much lime that it effervesces freely with\r\nan acid. It was composed originally of fragments of a hemi-crystalline\r\nbasic rock, of which the plagioclase phenocrysts have been replaced by\r\ncalcite; whilst the augite and interstitial glass is now represented by\r\nviridite and a chloritic mineral. It is to be inferred that at some time\r\nhot springs were very numerous in the district between Nukumbolo and the\r\nlower slopes of the range, those at Nukumbolo, as far as I know, alone\r\nexisting in our time.\r\n\r\nFrom a height of 1,100 or 1,200 feet the mountain slopes rise steeply to\r\nthe summit rather over 2,000 feet in elevation. At the foot are exposed\r\n_in situ_ aphanitic augite-andesites,[71] which in some specimens show a\r\nlittle alteration in the chalcedonic quartz filling minute cracks, and\r\nin one case there is an irregular cavity, ¾ inch across, filled with\r\nmilk-white opal. Another rock exposed at the foot of the steep ascent is\r\na semi-vitreous basaltic-andesite, doleritic in texture and ophitic\r\nstructure, but apparently not much changed.[72] At 1,700 feet is\r\ndisplayed a vesicular basic andesite, semi-vitreous in character, and\r\nabove this I found a porphyritic basaltic andesite.\r\n\r\nThe summit of the range is 1½ or 2 miles in breadth and is relatively\r\nlevel, its undulating surface varying in elevation between 1,900 and\r\n2,200 feet. The prevailing rocks exposed on this elevated plateau are\r\nvitreous pitchstone-like rocks finely vesicular and scoriaceous, the\r\ncavities being filled either with aragonite or with opal. The basic\r\nglass, of which they are formed, shows incipient crystals, and begins to\r\nfuse in an ordinary flame. One specimen obtained here is a doleritic\r\nbasaltic andesite, slightly ophitic and containing a fair amount of\r\nresidual glass.[73] However, the vitreous and scoriaceous character of\r\nmost of the rocks on the summit is very remarkable. (Similar rocks occur\r\non the top of Mount Thambeyu where the slopes of the mountain are\r\ncovered with submarine tuffs and agglomerates.) There is a precipitous\r\ndescent on the north side of the range to Sueni at its foot, massive\r\nbasaltic andesites being exposed at first, whilst basic tuffs and\r\nagglomerates are displayed lower down.\r\n\r\nThe special features of this traverse of the range are the alteration of\r\nthe tuffs and massive rocks between Nukumbolo and the lower southern\r\nslopes, the variation in character of the basic rocks in the upper\r\nsouthern slopes, the occurrence of vitreous vesicular and scoriaceous\r\nrocks on the summit, and the restriction of the ordinary basic\r\nagglomerates and tuffs to the northern slopes. Any attempt on my part to\r\nexplain the structure of this part of the range from the data here given\r\nwould be futile without comparing them with those obtained from other\r\nparts of the range. It will be subsequently pointed out that the\r\ndifficulties will be in part removed if it is assumed that the submarine\r\npalagonite-tuffs and agglomerates, that so often cover the flanks of the\r\nmountains to their summits, have been in this case largely stripped off\r\nby the denuding agencies.\r\n\r\n(5) THE SUENI VALLEY.—My acquaintance with the extreme eastern part of\r\nthe Koro-tini Range is restricted to the descent of the picturesque\r\nvalley from Sueni to Koro-utari. It is occupied by a tributary of the\r\nLambasa River, and is bounded on the east side by the lofty slopes of\r\nthe main range, and to the westward by a mountainous spur that projects\r\nfar into the Lambasa plains. Sueni lies by the river-side in the midst\r\nof mountains which rise steeply on most sides to heights of 2,000 feet\r\nand over, and often display precipitous bare faces apparently of\r\nvolcanic agglomerates. Numerous waterfalls may be observed on their\r\nflanks, which, as in other localities, doubtless indicate the occurrence\r\nof large intrusive dykes. Sueni is situated about 300 feet above the\r\nsea, the descent to Koro-utari at the mouth of the valley, a distance of\r\n3 to 4 miles in a direct line, being about 150 feet.\r\n\r\nThe river as it flows down the valley from Sueni to Koro-utari traverses\r\na region of basic agglomerates and agglomerate-tuffs. These deposits, as\r\nthey are displayed in the hill-slopes lying W.S.W. and at the back of\r\nSueni, are composed of blocks of the size of the fist of a vesicular\r\nbasaltic andesite; whilst the large masses on the surface are made of\r\nthe same, but non-vesicular, rock. The blocks in the agglomerates\r\nbetween Sueni and Koro-utari range usually from a few inches to a foot\r\nin diameter. A specimen obtained from one of them is made of a partly\r\nvitreous basaltic andesite; whilst in another case the rock is an\r\naltered basic andesite, the glassy groundmass being largely impregnated\r\nwith colloid silica looking like opal under the lens.[74]\r\n\r\nNearly a mile below Sueni, within a space of less than 60 yards, there\r\nare exposed at the river-side in the agglomerates three vertical or\r\nnearly vertical dykes, 4 to 6 feet in thickness. They trend roughly N.E.\r\nand S.W., and are non-columnar, except in the case of the one farthest\r\nup the river, which has rude, transverse joints.[75] The rocks composing\r\nthese dykes are somewhat doleritic basaltic andesites, olivine being\r\nvery rare or absent. The two highest, which are only 15 to 20 feet\r\napart, are made of similar rocks characterised by abundant interstitial\r\nglass, and having a sp. gr. of 2·78. The rock of the third dyke, about\r\n50 yards farther down the river, has but scanty glass in the groundmass,\r\nthe sp. gr. being 2·89. The differences between the two types\r\nrepresented in the three dykes are mainly concerned with the degree of\r\ncrystallisation, and it is probable that though not contemporaneous they\r\nwere derived from the same fluid magma which, as we may infer from the\r\nproximity and lie of the dykes, was situated at no great depth.[76]\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFERENCE RESPECTING THE KORO-TINI RANGE.—If we can imagine a\r\nline of vents, protruding in some cases above the surface of the sea,\r\nthat were ultimately worn down to a common level through marine-erosion,\r\nand were then largely covered over with submarine tuffs and\r\nagglomerates, we should have in our mind’s eye the first and most\r\nimportant stage in the formation of this range. If we then assume that\r\nthere followed a period of emergence characterised by a renewal on a\r\nvery extensive scale of marine-erosion, during which the agglomerates\r\nwere mainly formed, and that since that period the sub-aerial denuding\r\nagencies have been for ages in operation, we shall, I think, obtain some\r\nidea of the history of the Koro-tini Range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE KORO-MBASANGA RANGE\r\n\r\nAS is illustrated in the accompanying profile-sketch, the relatively\r\nlevel-topped range of Koro-tini gives place at its eastern end to a\r\nbroken line of mountains, of which the round-topped Koro-tambu, 2,753\r\nfeet in height, and the pinnacled Koro-mbasanga,[77] 2,537 feet, are the\r\nhighest peaks. Further east lies the broad Vuinandi Gap which separates\r\nthe Koro-mbasanga and Mount Thurston, or Thambeyu, ranges. The\r\ntwin-peaks of Mount Mbatini, the highest mountain of the island, appear\r\nin the background in the sketch, and to the left rises Thambeyu, the\r\nsecond highest summit.\r\n\r\nWe enter here another complex region of mountains; and if the character\r\nof the rocks are sometimes different we shall yet have to bear in mind\r\nin our interpretation of its geological features the lesson derived from\r\nthe examination of the Koro-tini Range. Before and behind all our facts\r\nof observation lie the two great periods of marine-erosion and the later\r\nages of sub-aerial denudation.\r\n\r\nWhen approached from the north, the western part of the range has a rude\r\ncrescentic form, and looks like the remnant of a gigantic crater-cavity\r\nabout two miles across. At the back rise, as shown in the second of the\r\nprofile-sketches, the precipitous slopes of Koro-mbasanga proper; whilst\r\nthe two spurs descending from it, one on the west, the Sokena spur,\r\ntowards Koro-utari, the other on the east, at the back of Nasawana, give\r\nthe crescentic figure open to the north. The last-named village lies\r\nnestled in this great hollow, the floor of which, though not in its\r\nlowest part below the level of the Lambasa plains, is not over 200 feet\r\nabove the sea. However, the facts adduced in the following description\r\nof this region do not give much support to this view of its\r\nsurface-configuration.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of description, I will first describe the peak of\r\nKoro-mbasanga, and then the Sokena ridge and, lastly, the Lovo valley\r\nthat cuts through the range to the eastward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: These three sections form a continuous profile-sketch of\r\nthe mountainous axis of Vanua Levu for a length of 15 or 16 miles and\r\ninclude the Thambeyu, Koro-mbasanga, and Koro-tini ranges as viewed from\r\nthe northward near Na Kama. The eastern section is at the top and the\r\nwestern section at the bottom. The summit of Thambeyu was covered with\r\nclouds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Koro-mbasanga from the north-north-east.]\r\n\r\n(1) KORO-MBASANGA.—The ascent of Koro-mbasanga is best made from\r\nNasawana, a village at its base, elevated rather over 200 feet above the\r\nsea, and distant about a mile and a half north-east from the peak. On\r\nthe way to the foot of the mountain we traverse an undulating region of\r\nbasaltic andesite,[78] which is merely the extension to the base of the\r\nmountains of the basaltic Lambasa plains. After commencing the ascent of\r\nthe steep slopes, we find exposed in a stream-course, 700 to 800 feet\r\nabove the sea, a sedimentary basic tuff, presenting layers of coarse and\r\nfine materials, and partly palagonitic in composition. It is a little\r\ncalcareous, and apparently incloses tests of foraminifera. These\r\nsubmarine deposits have evidently been stripped off the basaltic\r\nlow-lands beneath. It thus becomes evident that the structural features\r\nof the Lambasa plains (basaltic rocks overlain by submarine deposits)\r\nare preserved to the base of the range.\r\n\r\nThese submarine deposits, as exposed in the stream-course, lie beneath\r\nagglomerates which repose horizontally upon them; and from this level up\r\nto the bare rocky peak of the mountain, agglomerates and\r\nagglomerate-tuffs are alone displayed either as large detached masses or\r\nin cliff-faces.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the mountain the blocks, usually sub-angular, are\r\nabout a foot across; but they become smaller as one ascends towards the\r\nsummit, where they are 3 or 4 inches in diameter. At the top there are\r\nextensive exposures in cliff-faces of the agglomerate-tuffs; and here\r\nthe finer materials of the matrix include a few rounded pebbles not\r\nexceeding half an inch in size. This is a fact of importance in\r\nconnection with the submarine origin of these formations.\r\n\r\nAs regards their composition, the blocks of the agglomerates have not\r\nthe uniform character we would expect to find in the case of materials\r\ndirectly ejected from a volcanic vent. The most frequent type of rock\r\nrepresented is a grey hypersthene-augite-andesite, having a specific\r\ngravity of 2·72-2·78. It displays small phenocrysts of plagioclase and\r\nof rhombic and monoclinic pyroxene, but in other respects it exhibits\r\nmuch variety, not only in the arrangement and average length of the\r\nfelspar-lathes (·08 to ·18 mm.) but in the form of the pyroxene of the\r\ngroundmass (either granular or prismatic) and in the amount of residual\r\nglass, sometimes abundant, sometimes scanty. Two distinct genera (1 and\r\n5) of the sub-class are therefore represented.\r\n\r\nOther rocks found in these agglomerates contain no rhombic pyroxene, and\r\nare referred to genera 13 and 16 of the augite-andesites according to\r\nthe presence or absence of plagioclase phenocrysts. In the last case we\r\nhave a dark aphanitic rock (sp. gr. 2·74), sometimes scoriaceous, where\r\nthe average length of the felspar-lathes may be as little as ·04 mm. One\r\nof the blocks was composed of a highly scoriaceous semi-vitreous rock,\r\nthe cavities being filled with a zeolite. Another was composed of a\r\nblack porphyritic augite-andesite, showing large crystals of\r\nplagioclase.... The matrix of the agglomerate-tuff is formed of\r\nsub-angular and rounded fragments, up to a centimetre in size, of the\r\nsame andesites, the interstitial material being formed of fine detritus\r\nand palagonitic debris.\r\n\r\nThough the agglomerates of the peak of Koro-mbasanga are composed of a\r\nvariety of rocks, all the rocks are to be referred to the\r\npyroxene-andesites with specific gravity below 2·8 but above 2·7. They\r\nare therefore less basic than the olivine-basalts and basaltic andesites\r\nof the Koro-tini range, where the density is usually 2·8 and over. Their\r\nvariation, however, is more consistent with the characters of an\r\nagglomerate formed by marine erosion. The same may be said of the\r\nsorting of the blocks according to their size and of the occasional\r\noccurrence in the matrix of small rounded pebbles. That these deposits\r\nof agglomerates were formed under the sea is indicated also by their\r\noverlying submarine sedimentary tuffs near the base of the mountain.\r\n\r\n(2) THE SOKENA RIDGE.—To the west of Koro-mbasanga, and forming a spur\r\nof the same range, is the flat-topped hill of Sokena, which rises about\r\n1,100 feet above the country at its base and about 1,600 feet above the\r\nsea. From a distance it has the appearance of being formed in its higher\r\nportion of nearly horizontal strata dipping gently northward. In its\r\nupper part it terminates in a line of cliffs about 200 feet in height,\r\nand there is a similar line of cliffs lower down the slopes. These\r\ncliffs are composed of bedded fine and coarse non-calcareous tuffs,\r\ndipping about 10° N.N.W., in which are imbedded without any arrangement\r\nblocks, ranging in size from 2 or 3 inches to 3 or 4 feet, of a\r\nremarkable blackish pitchstone-like rock displaying opaque plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts. It is referred to genus 18 (see page 289) of the\r\nhypersthene-augite andesites, both rhombic and monoclinic pyroxene being\r\nrepresented in the phenocrysts and in the groundmass where they take the\r\nform of minute prisms (·03 mm.). There is a considerable amount of pale\r\nbrown glass. A rock very similar occurs in the Thambeyu agglomerates\r\n(see page 178). The tuffs are formed largely of palagonitic materials,\r\nthe angular fragments in the coarser beds being ½ to 2 centimetres in\r\nsize, the palagonite being often vacuolar but much affected by\r\nhydration.\r\n\r\nThese tuffs and agglomerates of the Sokena cliffs apparently contain no\r\norganic remains. They appear to have accumulated under water as the\r\nresult of the eruptions of a neighbouring vent without the intermediate\r\nagency of marine erosion.\r\n\r\n(3) THE ASCENT OF THE LOVO VALLEY.—About two miles to the east of the\r\npeak of Koro-mbasanga the picturesque Lovo valley cuts deeply in a\r\nsoutherly direction into the mountainous backbone of the island. The\r\nsite of the old town of Lovo lies within the valley about two miles from\r\nits mouth. “Lovo” is the Fijian word for a cannibal-oven; and I gathered\r\nfrom my natives that in the old times this vale was noted for its\r\ncannibal orgies. It is occupied by the Nasawana tributary of the Lambasa\r\nRiver, and often becomes so narrow that it may be described as a gorge.\r\nI followed the valley from its mouth, where it is elevated about 300\r\nfeet above the sea, for some miles in a southerly direction up to a\r\nheight of 1,000 feet, where the northern slope of the great\r\nmountain-mass of Mbatini commences.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the Lovo valley rise precipitous mountain-slopes,\r\ndisplaying in their cliff-faces and in the large detached rock-masses\r\nbasic agglomerates. The same formation is also usually displayed in the\r\nsides of the river. The blocks composing the agglomerates are formed of\r\nthe usual type of hemi-crystalline or semi-vitreous blackish basaltic\r\nandesite so characteristic of these deposits. It is generally compact,\r\nbut is at times amygdaloidal. Some distance below the old site of Lovo,\r\nand at an elevation of about 500 feet above the sea, there is an\r\ninteresting exposure in the river-side, where the agglomerates overlie\r\nbedded coarse calcareous basic tuffs containing large flat tests of\r\nforaminifera with pieces of molluscan shells, and dipping about 15° S.W.\r\nThese tuffs can be traced up the valley towards Lovo.\r\n\r\nDisplayed in mass in the bed of the river in the same locality, and\r\nbeneath the submarine tuff just referred to, is a porphyritic basaltic\r\nandesite (sp. gr. 2·79) containing but scanty interstitial glass, the\r\nfelspar-lathes being ·15 mm. in average length. It is referred to genus\r\n1 of the augite-andesites. The same rock is exposed at intervals in the\r\nriver-bed as far as Lovo, which is about 850 feet above the sea. At one\r\nplace it exhibits a rudely columnar structure, the columns being\r\nhorizontal and 2 to 2½ feet in diameter, the trend of the dyke-like mass\r\nbeing W. by S. and E. by N. Near Lovo a small dyke, 6 feet thick and\r\ntrending N.N.W. and S.S.E., pierces the agglomerate. It is composed of a\r\nsomewhat aphanitic augite-andesite closely resembling the rocks exposed\r\nin the river-course for a mile or so above Lovo up to an elevation of\r\n1,000 feet. In this upper part of the valley whilst agglomerates are\r\nexposed in the cliffs and precipitous mountain-slopes on either side,\r\npyroxene-andesites, somewhat aphanitic in texture and with a specific\r\ngravity of 2·68 to 2·7, are displayed in mass in the river bed. These\r\nlast-named rocks, which are closely similar to those found on the lower\r\nslopes of Mount Mbatini (see page 173) are, as I should have also\r\nremarked in the case of the basaltic andesite above mentioned, a little\r\naltered, as is indicated by the existence of calcite and viridite in the\r\ngroundmass.[79]\r\n\r\nFrom this instructive ascent of the Lovo valley we may learn that whilst\r\nthe mountain mass is formed, to a considerable depth, of agglomerates\r\nwith underlying submarine tuffs, the deeper seated rocks exposed in the\r\nriver-beds are massive intrusive rocks. The overlying agglomerates have\r\npreserved the submarine tuffs from destruction, and there is no\r\ndifficulty in assuming that they also were accumulated under the sea,\r\nbut in shallow water, as evidenced by the character of the tuffs. I\r\nfound no signs of alteration in these tuffs, and except in the case of\r\nthe small dyke above noticed there is no sign of the dykes penetrating\r\nthe agglomerates. We have here a section into the heart of the\r\nmountain-range; and assuming that the large intrusive masses of basic\r\nandesites had penetrated these deposits, there would certainly have been\r\nsome evidence of this in the extensive exposures of agglomerates far up\r\nthe mountain-sides. As it is, however, we find such rocks only in the\r\ndeeply excavated river-bed. If we imagine a submarine volcanic mountain,\r\nor one but slightly raised above the surface of the sea, to be subjected\r\nduring a long period of emergence to marine erosion, the “basal wreck”\r\nof the mountain would ultimately be covered over by submarine tuffs and\r\nagglomerates. This is the condition that seems to be presented here.\r\n\r\nI did not make the ascent of Koro-tambu, the other principal peak of the\r\nKoro-mbasanga Range. This round-topped mountain is well seen from the\r\nsummit of Mbatini from which it bears N. 30° W. by compass. It is\r\nprobably the peak marked 2,753 feet in the Admiralty chart, and is\r\nconnected with Mbatini by a saddle not under 1,500 feet in elevation.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important features in the above account of this\r\ndistrict may here be emphasised. We have seen that in the peak of\r\nKoro-mbasanga and in the Lovo valley agglomerates and agglomerate-tuffs,\r\nseveral hundred feet thick, overlie sedimentary submarine tuffs. In the\r\nlast-named locality the deeper massive basic rocks are also exposed; and\r\nwe may infer in both instances that the agglomerate-formation is a\r\nsubmarine deposit. On the other hand, in the Sokena Ridge, which is a\r\nspur of the main range, we have apparently the accumulation of materials\r\non a sea-bottom, directly ejected from a vent without the intervention\r\nof the agency of marine-erosion. In regard to this and other districts\r\nin this part of the island it should be remembered that east and west\r\noccur undoubted evidences of extensive submergence. It has already been\r\nshown that submarine tuffs containing tests of foraminifera and other\r\norganic remains occur at heights of 2,000 feet and over on the summit of\r\nthe Koro-tini Range, and it will be subsequently shown that similar\r\ndeposits are to be found on the neighbouring slopes of Thambeyu as high\r\nas 2,100 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MOUNT MBATINI\r\n\r\nAccording to the Admiralty chart this is the highest mountain in Vanua\r\nLevu, its elevation being 3,437 feet. It has twin peaks which lie either\r\nN.W. and S.E. or W.N.W. and E.S.E. with each other. The northerly or\r\nwesterly peak is pointed and tooth-like. Hence probably arises its name\r\nof Mbatini (mbati-tooth). The southerly or easterly peak is known as\r\nSoro-levu. It has a broadly conical outline with a truncated summit. The\r\nmountain is named Koro-mbasanga in the Admiralty chart, a name that\r\nreally belongs to a peak lying about 3 miles nearly due north (N. 5°\r\nW.). The natives are very clear in this matter; but it must be remarked\r\nin this connection that Koro-mbasanga, which signifies “a forked\r\neminence,” would be a very suitable appellation for the double-peaked\r\nsummit of Mbatini.[80] By the natives of the surrounding district the\r\nwhole mountain is known as Mbatini; but by the natives of the eastern\r\nshores of Natewa Bay, it is usually known as Soro-levu, since the\r\nwestern peak is often more or less hidden from view or is less\r\nconspicuous. The profile of this mountain and of the neighbouring region\r\nis shown in the accompanying profile-sketches and also in one of those\r\nillustrating the Koro-mbasanga range on page 167.\r\n\r\nAs viewed from the top of Mariko to the southward, Mbatini presents\r\nitself as a long mountain-ridge, trending W.N.W. and E.S.E., which is\r\nconnected on the north with Koro-tambu, the highest peak of the\r\nKoro-mbasanga Range, by a saddle probably not over 1,500 feet above the\r\nsea, and on the south with the mountain-ridge of Mariko by a _col_ which\r\nappears not to be under 1,000 feet in elevation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount Mbatini from the top of Koro-mbasanga. The distant\r\npeak on the right is one of the summits of the Mariko ridge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from Muanaira on the south coast of Natewa Bay.]\r\n\r\nMy ascent of this mountain was made from the north by the way of the\r\nLovo valley. In ascending the Lovo valley one reaches, at an elevation\r\nof about 1,000 feet, the foot of the north slope of Mbatini. The slope\r\nis somewhat steep up to 2,000 feet, the rocks exposed on the surface\r\nbeing closely similar in the groundmass to those displayed in the upper\r\npart of the Lovo valley. They are compact-looking blackish\r\naugite-andesites (sp. gr. 2·7), the very small felspar-lathes of the\r\ngroundmass, which are in flow arrangement, averaging only ·05 mm. in\r\nlength. Like the rocks below, they are a little altered; and here the\r\ninterstitial glass is also scanty. But they differ in the absence of\r\nrhombic pyroxene and are therefore referred to the augite-andesites\r\n(genus 13).\r\n\r\nAt 2,000 feet, where one crosses the foot-track from Nukumbolo to\r\nKorolau, the ascent of the true Mbatini ridge begins, the summit lying\r\nnearly two miles to the south-east. Whilst following along this lofty\r\nmountain-ridge we were for the greater part of the time in the\r\nrain-clouds, so that very little was seen of our surroundings. The crest\r\nis densely wooded so that our progress was very slow. The rocks are but\r\nsparingly exposed. At the commencement of the ridge (2,100 feet) is\r\ndisplayed an altered hypersthene-augite andesite, rudely columnar blocks\r\nof which, up to 2 feet in diameter, were lying about. It belongs to\r\ngenus 1 of this sub-class (see page 286) which also includes the rocks\r\nexposed farther along the ridge. In these rocks the felspar-lathes are\r\nsmall (·05-·07 mm. long) and are not in flow arrangement. The\r\ninterstitial glass varies in amount, and the specific gravity is about\r\n2·7.\r\n\r\nThe ascent is very gradual for the first one and a half miles, when an\r\nelevation of 2,600 feet is attained. From here one ascends the\r\nsteep-sided peak of Mbatini, which rises some 700 or 800 feet from the\r\nridge. As one nears the highest point the crest becomes very narrow,\r\nbetween 15 and 20 feet across; and on either side there is apparently a\r\ndrop of several hundred feet. The actual peak, which is bare and rocky,\r\nis yet narrower; and when it is enveloped in dense mist as it was in my\r\ninstance, it is not a very secure situation for a geologist. It is\r\nhighly magnetic, as is the case with most of the other bare peaks of the\r\nisland. The rocks exposed in the upper 500 feet, that is, in the peak\r\nproper, are highly altered semi-vitreous, but extensively weathered,\r\nhypersthene-augite-andesites which are referred to genus 1 of that\r\nsub-class. Much of the glassy groundmass is replaced by viridite,\r\nsilica, calcite, &c. Less altered specimens display in a brown opaque\r\nglass small felspar-lathes averaging less than ·1 mm. in length. They\r\nexhibit phenocrysts of rhombic pyroxene and augite, the first\r\nprevailing.\r\n\r\nI did not climb Soro-levu, the other of the twin-peaks. Its ascent\r\nshould be made either from Nukumbolo or from one of the villages on the\r\nneighbouring shore of Natewa Bay. My acquaintance with Mbatini, although\r\nvery incomplete, enables me however to point out a few of its general\r\nfeatures. As remarked before, there is a general uniformity in the type\r\nof its rocks. The olivine-basalts and basaltic andesites, prevailing in\r\nthe Koro-tini Range, are not here represented, nor are the dacites or\r\nacid andesites to be found. The characteristic rocks are more or less\r\naltered hypersthene-augite-andesites having a specific gravity in the\r\nleast altered and least vitreous condition of about 2·7; whilst the\r\naverage length of the felspar-lathes is always less than ·1 mm. The same\r\ntype prevails from the upper part of the Lovo valley to the summit of\r\nMbatini; but it is only in the actual peak that these rocks show much\r\nglass in the groundmass, though extensively affected by alteration.\r\nNeither tuffs nor agglomerates came under my notice; but they might be\r\nexpected to occur on the other slopes. I am inclined to regard this\r\nmountain-ridge as a huge dyke-like mass or sill, representing the\r\nremains of a volcanic vent that has been subjected at different periods\r\nto marine-erosion and in later ages to sub-aerial denudation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE VUINANDI GAP\r\n\r\nI have given this name to the break between the Thambeyu (Mount\r\nThurston) and Koro-mbasanga ranges, where the level of the mountainous\r\nbackbone of the island descends to about 1,200 feet above the sea. This\r\nis the route taken by the track from Vuinandi on the shores of Natewa\r\nBay across the island to Lambasa.\r\n\r\nAt Vuinandi the mountains recede from the coast leaving a broad level\r\nplain extending about two miles inland to the village of Tarawau without\r\nrising over 60 feet above the sea. Basaltic rocks are exposed in the\r\nspurs that descend from the mountains to the coast on each side of the\r\nplain. After traversing the low-lying region that lies between Vuinandi\r\nand the main range, one finds on ascending the eastern slopes, _en\r\nroute_ to Lambasa, basaltic andesites of the usual type prevailing up to\r\n1,000 feet. The upper portion of the dividing range, 1,000 to 1,200\r\nfeet, is composed of a more compact basaltic andesite which is often\r\nrubbly and in this condition is penetrated by fine cracks, 1/8 of an\r\ninch broad, filled with chalcedony. This rock, which has a specific\r\ngravity of 2·85, has a very fresh-looking appearance in the slide, and\r\nthe segregation of silica does not therefore appear to arise from an\r\nalterative change. The felspar-lathes, which are in flow-arrangement,\r\naverage ·11 mm. in length, and there is a little residual glass.\r\n\r\nThe mountains rise on either side of the Vuinandi Gap to about 2,000\r\nfeet. Descending on the west side of the range one follows a\r\nstream-course down to a level of 400 feet above the sea, agglomerates\r\nand coarse basic tuffs being exposed on the way. The rocks forming the\r\nagglomerates are for the most part to be referred to genus 1 of the\r\nhypersthene-augite andesites. They are sometimes compact and sometimes\r\namygdaloidal, the amygdules being formed of chalcedony and other\r\nminerals, whilst the glass of the groundmass is often altered.\r\n\r\nThe track then lay across a spur, 800 feet in height, principally\r\ncomposed of a greyish porphyrite, exhibiting large opaque crystals of\r\nplagioclase, 4 to 7 mm. long, in an almost holo-crystalline groundmass\r\nformed of stout lamellar felspars with large augite granules. It is\r\ndescribed on page 268 under the porphyritic sub-genus of genus 2 of the\r\naugite-andesites, and is an unusual type of rock for this island. After\r\nthis I descended into the picturesque gorge of the Satulaki River, which\r\nis only elevated about 200 feet above the sea, agglomerates prevailing.\r\nIn the vicinity of Satulaki a rather compact basaltic andesite (sp. gr.\r\n2·82) is commonly exposed in position. It is referred to genus 13 of the\r\naugite andesites and belongs to the species with felspar-lathes less\r\nthan ·1 mm. in average length. It occurs both north and south of this\r\nplace and in the hill-spurs on either side. This is the bed-rock of the\r\nLambasa plains which here begin and extend to the north coast, being\r\nusually covered with submarine tuffs and clays.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE THAMBEYU OR MOUNT THURSTON RANGE\r\n\r\nMount Thurston is the name given in the Admiralty charts to the highest\r\npeak (3,124 feet) of this range. There does not appear to be any general\r\nnative name. The highest peak visible from the Lambasa side is known as\r\n“Thambeyu.” The lofty mountain-mass, as it is viewed from Vuinandi, is\r\nknown as Ulu-i-ndiri-ndiri.[81] The whole mountain-range has yet to be\r\nproperly explored. It is a much more complicated system of\r\nmountain-ridges than is indicated in the chart, my acquaintance with it\r\nbeing restricted to the Thambeyu ridge, the elevation of which is 2,600\r\nfeet above the sea. It trends N.N.W. and S.S.E.; but its relation to the\r\nhighest peak of the range could not be ascertained, as we were in the\r\nrain-clouds during the two days we were on the mountain.\r\n\r\nI made the ascent from the village of Numbu-ni-a-vula about three miles\r\nto the westward, which is only 200 feet above the sea. In the\r\nintervening low district a basaltic andesite is exposed in the\r\nstream-courses. The structure of the ridge, as indicated by the ascent\r\nof its western slope, is shown in the accompanying diagram. The core or\r\ncentral axis is formed of massive basic rocks which protrude at the\r\nsummit and in one or two of the crests of the spurs. The flanks are\r\ncomposed of submarine tuffs and clays overlaid by agglomerates of\r\nconsiderable thickness. The tuffs reach to within 50 feet of the top,\r\nwhilst the agglomerates extend to within 400 feet of the summit. The\r\nresults obtained from this ascent are specially interesting, since it\r\nafforded me the opportunity of studying in a satisfactory manner the\r\njunction of the agglomerates with the tuffs.\r\n\r\nThere are two caves on the mountain-side which can be used for\r\nnight-shelter by those exploring the range. The lowest, 1,500 feet above\r\nthe sea, is the Taloko Cave (na-ngara-taloko). The highest is the Ndromo\r\nCave,[82] 2,100 feet, known to the natives as “na-ngara-vatu-ni-ndromo.”\r\nLike most of the caves all over the island they occur at the junction of\r\nthe agglomerates and tuffs, and are to be attributed to the more rapid\r\nweathering of the underlying tuffs.... In describing the results of my\r\nexamination of this mountain-ridge, I will deal in succession with the\r\ntuffs, the agglomerates, the junction between these two deposits, and\r\nthe axis or core of basic rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Image: Ideal Section of Thombeyu]]\r\n\r\n(1) _The submarine tuffs and tuff-clays._—As exposed in the\r\nstream-courses near and at the foot of the mountain and as high as the\r\nTaloko Cave, these deposits are bedded horizontally. At higher levels,\r\nowing to insufficient exposure the bedding is not so clear. Up to 700 or\r\n800 feet coarse palagonite-tuffs prevail; but they do not effervesce\r\nwith an acid, and apparently contain but scanty organic remains. At 950\r\nfeet coarse and fine sedimentary tuffs alternate, the last being\r\ngreenish foraminiferous tuff-clay rocks, somewhat compacted and\r\ncontaining 10 per cent. of carbonate of lime. The tests of the\r\nforaminifera, which are abundant and of the Globigerina type, are filled\r\nwith calcite. Several fragments, of a semi-vitreous basic rock, not\r\nhowever exceeding ·2 mm. in size, are inclosed in the deposit; but the\r\nmass of it is made up of yet finer materials of the same rock,\r\npalagonitic detritus, plagioclase fragments, fine calcitic debris, tests\r\nof foraminifera, &c. These fine tuff-clays were evidently formed in\r\nrelatively deep-water.\r\n\r\nAt the Taloko Cave (1,500 feet), where there are exposed rather coarse\r\ntuffs containing bands about a centimetre thick of a fine clay-tuff, the\r\nlast-named effervesce freely with an acid, whilst the first contain only\r\na little carbonate of lime. No sections have been made of these\r\ndeposits; but when powdered and examined under the microscope they\r\nappear to have the same general composition as the deposit described\r\nabove from an elevation of 950 feet. They are probably foraminiferous\r\nthough scantily. The tuffs found at the Ndromo Cave (2,100 feet) contain\r\n4 per cent. of carbonate of lime and small tests of foraminifera are\r\nvisible with a lens. The mineral fragments include plagioclase and\r\nrhombic pyroxene, and there are inclosed rounded gravel-fragments, 5 mm.\r\nin size, of a semi-vitreous rock. Palagonitic debris make up the mass of\r\nthese tuffs. A coarse deposit from 2,500 feet is non-calcareous, but has\r\nthe same general composition.\r\n\r\n(2) _The agglomerates._—These deposits are best represented in the upper\r\npart of the mountain, between 1,500 and 2,200 feet above the sea. Here\r\nthey often present vertical precipices having a drop varying between 100\r\nand 400 feet, with the submarine tuffs exposed at their base. Such\r\ncliffs, however, display no structure. Their vertical faces are to be\r\nattributed to joints and to the extensive “slips” that frequently occur\r\non these slopes, when large masses of agglomerate, undermined by the\r\npercolation of springs through the tuffs beneath them, roll far down the\r\nmountain-sides. The blocks of the agglomerates are fairly uniform in\r\nsize, being usually 4 or 5 inches across. They are composed of a\r\nsemi-vitreous hypersthene-augite andesite, containing both augite and\r\nrhombic pyroxene, but of an unusual type. It is a blackish rock carrying\r\nopaque phenocrysts of plagioclase, and is characterised by the prismatic\r\nform of the pyroxene (monoclinic) of the groundmass. A very similar rock\r\nfrom the Sokena agglomerates has been before described. It is referred\r\nto genus 18 of the class, and the prismatic sub-order to which that\r\ngenus belongs is described on page 289.\r\n\r\n(3) _The junction of the agglomerates and submarine tuffs._—This is well\r\ndisplayed at the Taloko Cave. Here the agglomerates lie conformably on\r\nthe sedimentary tuffs; but the line of junction is sharply defined and\r\nthe only evidence of transition is afforded by the great diminution in\r\nthe size of the blocks of the agglomerates, which are 1 to 2 inches\r\nacross. Immediately beneath the agglomerate is a layer 2½ centimetres\r\nthick of a rather coarse sedimentary palagonite-tuff having the\r\ncomposition of the deposits above described, but not effervescing with\r\nan acid, and showing no foraminiferous tests. The size of its “grain” is\r\nabout a millimetre. This passes downward rather abruptly into a\r\nchocolate-coloured marl-like rock, a centimetre thick, which is formed\r\nof the same materials but in a clayey condition. Beneath this is the\r\ncalcareous foraminiferous palagonite-tuff referred to in the first\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that for some time before the agglomerates began to\r\naccumulate on the sea-bottom there had been a fairly uniform deposit of\r\nsubmarine tuffs, evidently in rather deep water. Then followed a period\r\nduring which the finest mud was deposited which is represented by the\r\nthin layer of chocolate-coloured clay. This was succeeded by the\r\ndeposition of coarser sedimentary tuffs forming a layer about an inch in\r\nthickness. Then commenced the accumulation of the agglomerates, of which\r\nthe materials were at first small and afterwards larger in size.\r\n\r\n(4) _The core or axis of volcanic rocks._—This is represented on the\r\nsummit by masses, 2 to 5 feet across, of two kinds of hypersthene-augite\r\nandesite, which are referred to genus 1 of that sub-class. One is a\r\ncompact grey rock (sp. gr. 2·72) carrying phenocrysts both of rhombic\r\nand monoclinic pyroxene, the former prevailing, and displaying a small\r\namount of interstitial glass. It is magnetic and exhibits marked\r\npolarity, as noticed in Chapter XXVI. The other is a scoriaceous rock\r\ncontaining numerous round steam-pores, ranging up to 5 millimetres in\r\ndiameter and generally filled with clear quartz-crystals and lined by\r\nchalcedony. It contains semi-opaque glass in abundance, and is\r\napparently a semi-vitreous form of the rock just described. Both rocks\r\nare to some extent altered.... On the crest of a spur, 500 feet below\r\nthe summit, is exposed in position an augite-andesite, assigned to genus\r\n13, sub-genus 1, species B, of that sub-class. It is non-scoriaceous and\r\nexhibits a considerable amount of greenish alteration products. (Sp. gr.\r\n2·79.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE AVUKA RANGE\r\n\r\nThis high range, which lies immediately to the east of Lambasa, attains\r\nits greatest elevation in Mount Avuka, which is 1,976 feet above the\r\nsea. It represents the extension northward to the coast of the inland\r\nThambeyu mountains that culminate in Mount Thurston. In its upper\r\nportion Mount Avuka presents bare precipitous faces apparently of\r\nagglomerates and some hundreds of feet in height. My acquaintance with\r\nthis range is scanty. In a traverse from Lambasa to Ngele-mumu I crossed\r\nit a mile or more south of Mount Avuka, where it is only 700 feet in\r\nelevation. I also rounded the end of the range where it reaches the\r\ncoast between Lambasa and the valley of Mbuthai-sau. This last locality,\r\nwhich is described on page 218, derives especial interest from the\r\ncircumstance that here the regions of basic and acid rocks meet. The\r\nbasic rocks that occupy nearly all the sea-border from Naivaka to\r\nLambasa here become mingled with, and finally give place to, the acid\r\nrocks which prevail in all the region eastward as far as Undu Point.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the range on the way from Lambasa to Ngelemumu, I noticed as\r\nhigh as 450 feet basic non-calcareous tuffs displaying a concretionary\r\narrangement suggestive of the proximity of an intrusive igneous rock.\r\nFurther up the western slope occur basic agglomerates, whilst at and\r\nnear the top (700 feet) there lie on the surface large boulders of a\r\ndark grey hypersthene-gabbro having a specific gravity of 2·7 and\r\nbelonging to the type of plutonic rocks described on page 249. It is\r\nvery probable that this gabbro forms the axis of the range; and we have\r\nhere no doubt one of the oldest of the mountain-ridges in the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE VALANGA RANGE\r\n\r\nTHIS range, which trends N.W. and S.E. between the Mariko mountain-ridge\r\nand the head of the valley of Na Kula, attains a height of 1,880 feet at\r\nits N.W. and of 1,710 feet at its S.E. end. The average elevation,\r\nhowever, is probably not over 1,300 or 1,400 feet. My acquaintance with\r\nthe range is only partial, but it is sufficient to bring to light some\r\nof its leading structural features. Those who follow me will find in\r\nthese mountains a very interesting region for their geological\r\nexplorations.\r\n\r\n(1) TRAVERSE OF THE VALANGA RANGE.—In making the journey from Valanga to\r\nVunimbua, I crossed the range where its elevation was about 1,300 feet.\r\nBasic agglomerates, containing sometimes amygdaloidal blocks, are\r\ndisplayed in the low district between Valanga and the foot of the range.\r\nIn the stream-course at the base of the slope the deeper seated rocks of\r\nthe range are at once exposed. Large masses, 5 or 6 feet across, of\r\naltered grey pyroxene andesites lie in the bed of the stream. Some of\r\nthem show opaque porphyritic felspar and have the appearance of\r\nporphyrites (sp. gr. 2·67). They belong to the type described on page\r\n271 under genus 6 of the augite-andesites. Others are grey propylitic\r\nvarieties of a basic semi-doleritic andesite penetrated by cracks\r\ncontaining calcite, and displaying in a groundmass, exhibiting much\r\nviridite and a little pyrites, calcitic pseudomorphs of the felspar\r\nphenocrysts and more or less parallel felspar-lathes, ·15 mm. long and\r\nsomewhat altered. Another of the deeper-seated rocks commonly exposed on\r\nthe upper west slopes of the range is a dark grey rock showing much\r\nporphyritic pyroxene (sp. gr. 2·72). It has a micro-felsitic groundmass\r\nand is referred to the fourth order of the hypersthene-augite-andesites\r\ndescribed on page 291.\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the way up the western slope of the range, there is\r\nexposed a coarse palagonite-tuff, evidently an incrusting deposit. Stout\r\ncrystals of augite can be picked out of it, and it contains also lapilli\r\nup to an inch in size of a basic vesicular semi-vitreous basalt.\r\n\r\nDescending the eastern slopes one observes between 1,200 and 1,000 feet\r\nlarge blocks of the same grey hypersthene-augite-andesite above\r\nmentioned and of a grey granitoid rock of the gabbro type. This last is\r\na hypersthene-gabbro with specific gravity of 2·75, and belongs to the\r\ngroup of plutonic rocks described on page 250. Its pyroxene phenocrysts\r\nare often represented by fibrous bastite. One can scarcely doubt that\r\nthis gabbro is the plutonic equivalent of the prevailing grey\r\npyroxene-andesites.\r\n\r\nLower down the slope only small fragments of rocks were exposed,\r\nprobably derived from an agglomerate. One of the specimens here obtained\r\nis a doleritic basaltic andesite (sp. gr. 2·77). Another is a very\r\ninteresting rock displaying large porphyritic crystals of a mineral like\r\nbronzite in a groundmass originally to a large degree vitreous; but the\r\nglass is now replaced by viridite and secondary crystalline silica. The\r\n“bronzite” is the result of the conversion of associated rhombic and\r\nmonoclinic pyroxene into fibrous bastite.\r\n\r\nFrom the results of the traverse across this part of the Valanga Range\r\nit may be inferred that more or less altered grey basic andesites\r\npassing into gabbros chiefly compose it. No doubt at one time it was\r\nlargely covered with basic tuffs and agglomerates, but these deposits\r\nhave been almost completely stripped off by the denuding agencies, and\r\nwere only noticed in one place on the western flank.\r\n\r\nThat the northern part of the range towards the Mariko ridge has a\r\nsimilar structure is shown by the character of the loose blocks in the\r\nupper course of the Vunimbua River, which takes its rise on these\r\nslopes. Amongst those in the river above the village I noticed a\r\nsolitary block of a coarsely crystalline diorite containing prisms of\r\nbrown hornblende a centimetre in length.[83] But the rocks most\r\nfrequently represented were propylitic grey hypersthene-andesites, in\r\nwhich the pyroxene is mostly changed into bastite, whilst the surface\r\noften sparkles with pyrites (see page 297).\r\n\r\n(2) NGONE HILL.—This is a curious conical hill, about 700 feet in\r\nheight, that rises up on the right side of the Vunimbua River about 1½\r\nmiles above the village of that name and near the foot of the range. It\r\nevidently represents a “volcanic neck,” and doubtless this vent was the\r\nsource of the large blocks forming the basic agglomerate that occurs in\r\nhuge masses in the river-course in the vicinity of this hill. On its\r\nlower flanks is exposed a hard compacted tuff, showing pyroxene\r\ncrystals, which is composed principally of fragments of a palagonitised\r\nvacuolar basic glass, the minute cavities being often filled with opal.\r\nIn the upper part of the hill is displayed a massive altered\r\naugite-andesite penetrated by fine veins of chalcedony. Numerous\r\nirregular cavities filled with the same material occur in its dark\r\nopaque glassy groundmass.\r\n\r\nThe blocks of the agglomerates found in the vicinity of the hill vary in\r\nsize from 4 to 18 inches. They are composed of a compact blackish\r\nsemi-vitreous basic andesite (sp. gr. 2·73) of the type characteristic\r\nof the basic agglomerates over most of the island. The matrix of the\r\nagglomerate is hard and somewhat altered, and is chiefly made up of\r\nfragments, ranging up to 5 mm. in size, of a vacuolar basic glass,\r\nsometimes but slightly changed, though usually converted into\r\npalagonite, the vacuoles being filled with chalcedonic opal. The large\r\nmasses of coarse tuffs displayed in the bed of a stream-course close to\r\nNgone Hill are non-calcareous and composed of palagonitic materials.\r\nPalagonite-tuff clays are also exposed in the river-course a little\r\nabove Vunimbua. About half-way between the village and the hill there\r\noccurs in position at the river-side an amygdaloidal basic rock, the\r\namygdules being formed of chalcedonic opal.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that this hill represents a lesser vent which probably\r\ndates back to the period before the emergence. All the products of its\r\neruption are, however, more or less altered. From the absence of sorting\r\nin the blocks of the agglomerates, and from the character of the matrix,\r\nit may be inferred that these deposits have been accumulated directly\r\nfrom the ejected materials without the intervention of the agency of\r\nmarine erosion.\r\n\r\n(3) THE WESTERN FLANK OF THE VALANGA RANGE.—One of the boldest pieces of\r\ncoast in the island lies on the eastern side of Savu-savu Bay, between\r\nthe mouth of the Ndreke-ni-wai River and Valanga Harbour. Here a number\r\nof lofty headlands separated by broad valleys descend with precipitous\r\nfronts to the shore, some of them, as in the case of the Nambathi\r\npromontory on the north side of Valanga Harbour, retaining an elevation\r\nof 1,000 feet within a few hundred yards of the coast.\r\n\r\nBy following the coast-track from the Ndreke-ni-wai River to Valanga one\r\ncrosses some of these headlands. As far as Vatu-lele altered red tuffs,\r\nbasic agglomerates, and massive basaltic andesites are the prevailing\r\nrocks. The red tuffs exhibit a double alteration. They were originally\r\ncomposed of finely pulverised basic vacuolar glass, which subsequently\r\nbecame palagonitised, and afterwards there was an extensive deposition\r\nof chalcedonic silica and of red iron oxide. No organic remains appear\r\nto exist; whilst the scanty calcite present is evidently an alteration\r\nproduct. Where the road “tops” the headland on the north side of\r\nVatu-lele Bay, there is exposed a dyke-like mass of a rubbly\r\nsemi-vitreous basaltic rock penetrated in all directions by veins, 1 to\r\n3 inches thick, of a tachylytic glass, splinters of which fuse readily\r\nin the ordinary spirit-lamp flame. The numerous fissures were doubtless\r\nproduced during the consolidation of the rock; and subsequently they\r\nwere filled with the still fluid residual portion of the magma, which\r\nwould be composed of the most fusible constituents. This subject, which\r\nbears on the origin of palagonite, is discussed in Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\nBetween Vatu-lele and Urata, palagonite-tuffs and basic agglomerates are\r\nchiefly displayed. On the north slope descending to Urata there is\r\nexposed in the foot-path a dyke-like mass of a dark-grey\r\nhornblende-pyroxene-andesite, an unusual type of rock which is described\r\non page 298. Just south of Urata I observed an agglomerate containing\r\nlarge blocks, 3 or 4 feet across, of the deeper-seated altered grey\r\npyroxene-andesites that with the gabbros and diorites form the axis of\r\nthe range.\r\n\r\n(4) THE VALLEY OF NA KULA.—In crossing from Sava-reka-reka to Natewa\r\nBay, one ascends the remarkable valley of the Kula and traverses the\r\nridge at its head. This ridge, which is about 700 feet in height and\r\nforms the termination of the Valanga Range, is composed of altered grey\r\nhornblende-pyroxene-andesites and of similar holo-crystalline rocks\r\nrepresenting the gabbro or plutonic type of the same. One of these rocks\r\nis described on page 250, under the head of hornblende-gabbro. Another\r\nis referred provisionally to the hypersthene-gabbros (page 249); but it\r\nis extensively occupied by chlorite, viridite, and other alteration\r\nproducts. Here, as with the other rocks of the Na Kula Ridge, the\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts are opaque, the result of the numerous fine\r\ncracks with decomposition products in the interior of the crystals....\r\nIt is thus seen that in general structure the Na Kula Ridge represents\r\nthe main axis of the Valanga Range to the north.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Na Kula is occupied by a river which does not empty\r\nitself, as one would expect, into Savu-savu Bay, but turns off sharply\r\nto the south at right-angles to its previous course, and after breaking\r\nthrough the coast range, opens into Naindi Bay. This peculiarity has\r\nattracted the attention of the natives. The village of Sawa-Ndrondro,\r\nwhich lies about 1½ miles up this valley, is not elevated more than 50\r\nfeet above the sea. The gradient is evidently not only very slight but\r\nis also irregular, so that in their upper course about 3 miles inland,\r\nwhere the elevation is only 130 feet, the waters of the river are\r\npartially checked in their flow and form extensive swamps where the\r\n“vitho” or wild sugar-cane flourishes.\r\n\r\n(5) CONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE VALANGA RANGE.—It may be inferred from the\r\ngeological structure of the range that it is one of the oldest in the\r\nisland. The agglomerates and tuffs that enter so largely into the\r\nformation of most of the other mountain-ridges are here to a great\r\nextent absent, except in the lower flanks; and we have exposed the axis\r\nof the range composed of more or less altered grey pyroxene and\r\nhornblende-pyroxene andesites passing, as appears to be the case, into\r\ngabbros and diorites. It is true that the exposure of the gabbros is\r\nlimited and that only a single block of diorite came under my notice;\r\nbut this might be looked for where the plutonic rocks are deeply seated.\r\nAlthough far overtopped by the neighbouring agglomerate mountain-ridge\r\nof Mariko, the Valanga Range would seem to date back to a much earlier\r\nstage in the history of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE MOUNTAIN-RIDGE OF MARIKO\r\n\r\nThis mountain-ridge, which trends nearly east and west and joins the\r\nValanga Range, rises in mass to a height of rather over 2,000 feet.\r\nAbove this elevation it terminates in several short conical peaks, of\r\nwhich the highest, 2,890 feet, is named Mariko, the Drayton Peak of the\r\nchart. One of the peaks, lying a little to the east of the summit, and\r\napparently between 100 and 200 feet lower, is called the Vatu-mbutho or\r\nWhite Rock. In the profile of the range, as seen nearly “end-on” from\r\nthe distant south shore of Natewa Bay, it would appear to be rounded in\r\nits upper part. Its true outline, however, when viewed in length, is, as\r\ndescribed above, namely, a massive ridge with various peaks.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed from the top of the hills behind Valanga, this mountainous\r\nrange has a very imposing appearance. On the south side it rises\r\nprecipitously to the summit, but the northern slopes below an elevation\r\nof 1,800 or 1,900 feet descend with a very easy gradient for 1½ or 2\r\nmiles into the valley of the river Ndreke-ni-wai. In the first case the\r\naverage angle of the slope would be from 15 to 20 degrees and in places\r\noften more; whilst in the second case the average inclination would be\r\nabout 7 degrees. The contrast between the two sides of the range is very\r\nstriking and one ought, I think, to find a parallel in the broken-down\r\nrim of a large crater with a gentle outer slope and a precipitous inner\r\nface. When descending recently the outer slope of Monte Somma, the\r\nancient Vesuvian vent, I found reproduced some of the features of the\r\nnorthern slope of Mariko. The tuffs and agglomerate-tuffs that cover\r\ntheir outer flanks are in both mountains deeply scored by the gorges and\r\nravines worn by the torrents. After the description of the geological\r\nstructure of the Mariko Range, we shall perhaps be in a better position\r\nto consider this question; but until a proper survey of the region has\r\nbeen made it will not be possible to give a final answer. There are also\r\nmany other uncertainties which would be removed by the accurate mapping\r\nof the district, such for instance as the mode of connection between the\r\nMariko and Valanga Ranges.\r\n\r\nThe highest peak of the Mariko Range is irregularly square-topped and is\r\nonly a few paces across. It has a soil-cap and supports small trees and\r\nshrubs, whilst there is a precipitous rocky face on the east and south.\r\nLike most of the other lofty peaks of the island it is magnetic, and as\r\nremarked on page 368, it markedly deflects the compass-needle.\r\n\r\nI made two ascents of this mountain from Vunimbua, one to the highest\r\npeak (2,890 feet), and the other across the range to Nukumbolo at a\r\npoint half a mile or more to the west of the summit, where its elevation\r\nis 2,200 feet. Basic agglomerates and agglomerate-tuffs prevail on both\r\nthe slopes up to 1,800 or 2,000 feet, the blocks being composed of a\r\ndark semi-vitreous basic andesite referred to the hypersthene-augite\r\nsub-class with specific gravity 2·75. It contains much glass in the\r\ngroundmass, and since the pyroxene of the groundmass is prismatic, this\r\nrock belongs to the prismatic sub-order described on page 289. Ordinary\r\nbasic tuffs are also well represented on the north flank. On the south\r\nor precipitous side they are usually more or less altered. Here, for\r\ninstance, they may take the form of a hard breccia-tuff containing\r\nvesicular lapilli, up to half-an-inch in size, of a semi-vitreous basic\r\nrock, the small steam-holes being either empty or filled with opal or\r\nchalcedony. The matrix of the rock is made up of finer fragments of a\r\nbasic vacuolar glass, showing a few felspar microliths, but often more\r\nor less palagonitised. Evidence of further alteration is afforded by the\r\nsmall cracks and crevices filled with chalcedony.\r\n\r\nOther altered tuff-rocks are exposed on the south slope. At an elevation\r\nof 400-450 feet above the sea, and underlying the agglomerates and\r\nbreccia-tuffs, I found exposed in a stream-course a hard dark rock\r\nlooking like a compact andesite. Under the microscope, however, it is\r\nshown to be an altered palagonite-tuff composed in part of angular\r\nfragments of plagioclase and of rhombic and monoclinic pyroxene, not\r\nexceeding ·15 mm. in size, and containing also similar-sized fragments\r\nof a basic hemicrystalline rock. The base is made up of palagonitic\r\nmaterial and contains a few “Globigerina” tests sometimes displaying\r\ncalcite in their interior. Fine cracks filled with chalcedonic silica\r\ntestify to a subsequent alteration of the deposit. At 1,500 feet occurs\r\na hard red altered palagonite-tuff, having a similar composition and\r\nbeing altered in like fashion, but not displaying tests of foraminifera\r\nin the slide.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks refer to the main undivided mass of the range,\r\nthat is, up to 2,000 feet. The highest peak of Mariko probably\r\nrepresents in structure the other peaks rising to various heights on\r\neither side of it. Here, at elevations between 2,000 feet and the\r\nsummit, a rubbly agglomerate prevails of a somewhat different character\r\nfrom that occurring at lower levels. It is well exposed in some\r\ncave-cliffs at a height of 2,500 feet and also in the rocky face of the\r\npeak. The rock composing the blocks is a dark-grey aphanitic\r\naugite-andesite (sp. gr. 2·65), referred to genus 20 of that sub-class\r\nand displaying prismatic pyroxene in the groundmass. Smoky residual\r\nglass exists usually in fair amount; whilst in the blocks of the\r\ncave-cliffs it is so abundant that the rock may be termed semi-vitreous.\r\nIn the locality just named the blocks are scoriaceous, the steam-pores,\r\nwhich are drawn out to a length of 5 or 6 mm. and more, being partially\r\nor completely filled with calcite and occasionally with opal. At times\r\nthe steam cavities are much larger. In one of my specimens there is an\r\nelongated cavity 5 cm. (2 inches) in length, which has a thin lining of\r\nchalcedony, from the surface of which pyramidal crystals of calcite\r\nproject into the interior. (I found the same grey andesite exposed _in\r\nsitu_ lower down the south slope at an elevation of 1,800 feet, but\r\nnon-scoriaceous.) The matrix of the agglomerate principally consists of\r\nfine palagonitic material with small fragments of plagioclase and\r\npyroxene but apparently no lime.\r\n\r\nAt heights of about 2,800 feet on the south side of the peak, and of\r\n1,600 feet on the north flank of the range, are exposed non-calcareous\r\ngreyish tuffs remarkable for the quantity of crystals of rhombic\r\npyroxene, entire and in fragments, that they contain. This is a\r\ncharacteristic feature of the more acid andesitic tuffs of the island,\r\nand it is to these deposits that the Mariko tuffs in question make a\r\nnear approach. They contain at times subangular fragments of more basic\r\nrocks; and are true tuffs in the sense that although perhaps deposited\r\non a sea-bottom they represent the ejected materials of a subaerial\r\nvent.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the range, where it is crossed by the road from Vunimbua to\r\nNukumbolo and for 200 feet below, is formed of a decomposed rock,\r\nperhaps a breccia. A fragment of the rock obtained from the crest is a\r\ngrey somewhat altered hypersthene-augite andesite (sp. gr. 2·75) with an\r\northophyric groundmass, and referred to the order described on page 290.\r\nThis rock may be connected with the tuffs above alluded to.... Reference\r\nmay here be made to a black basaltic rock (sp. gr. 2·88) of which, at an\r\nelevation of 2,500 feet at the foot of the peak, I found a portion of a\r\ncolumnar block about 18 inches across. It may prove to be an\r\nolivine-basalt; but no section has been made of it.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the foregoing description of the Mariko Range that\r\nin general structure it does not differ materially from the other\r\nmountain-ridges of the island, although in the types of the rocks it\r\npresents some variety. Here also we have agglomerates prevailing on the\r\nflanks and forming the summit. As far as the characters of the rocks can\r\nguide us, we cannot determine whether the range has been built up by a\r\nnumber of vents on a great fissure, or whether it represents the remains\r\nof a huge crater. In this uncertainty we can only appeal to the contrast\r\nbetween the gentle gradient of the north slopes and the precipitous\r\ndescent of the south slopes as favouring the last supposition. We\r\ncannot, however, doubt that the agglomerates of the upper portion of the\r\nrange are the products of an eruptive vent or of vents that rose above\r\nthe surface of the sea, since the blocks are all of one kind of andesite\r\nand are often scoriaceous. We can be fairly certain that at such a time\r\nthe lower slopes were in part submerged, seeing that foraminiferous\r\ntuffs underlying the agglomerates are now exposed. But we have to\r\ndistinguish between these submarine basic tuffs of the lower slopes\r\nwhich may in part be the result of marine-erosion and the grey\r\nrhombic-pyroxene-tuffs of the upper levels which are probably derived\r\nfrom subaerial eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SAVU-SAVU PENINSULA\r\n\r\nI include in this district the promontory west of Naindi Bay and\r\nSava-reka-reka Bay. Although its surface is much cut up, it has, when\r\nviewed from a distance, a fairly even profile and attains a maximum\r\nheight of rather over 800 feet. From the region east of it, it is\r\nseparated by the Naindi Gap. Here one can cross the peninsula between\r\nthe two bays above named without rising more than 50 feet above the sea.\r\nThe elevated interior is divided into two parts, which are divided by a\r\n_col_, about 250 feet in elevation, which is ascended in crossing from\r\nNaithekoro on the south coast to Na Kama on the north coast. Much of the\r\nsurface is clothed with the usual “talasinga” vegetation. Close to the\r\nnorth shore, with which it is connected by the reef-flat, rises the\r\nsmall island of Na-Wi, and off the extremity of the peninsula, which is\r\nknown as Harman’s Point, is the islet of Naviavia, formed of raised\r\nreef-limestone as described on p. 8. The celebrated boiling springs\r\nknown as Na Kama are situated on the north coast opposite Na-Wi. It may\r\nbe remarked in passing that besides finding an exit in the springs, the\r\nhot water oozes through the beach and below the tide-marks for several\r\nhundred yards along the shore. These springs are described in detail on\r\np. 25.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the few districts of the island in which elevated\r\nreef-masses occur at the sea-border. These old reefs, which attain a\r\nmaximum elevation of 250 feet above the sea, are principally restricted\r\nto the neighbourhood of Naindi Bay. (They are referred to in detail in\r\nChapter II.) But they indicate only a part of the submergence which this\r\nregion has experienced. There is an exposure of a very interesting rock\r\nin a stream-course that is crossed on the road from Yaroi to Naindi,\r\nless than a mile from the first-named place, and about 30 feet above the\r\nsea. Here we find a dark, impure “Globigerina” limestone, or, as it\r\nmight be also designated, an altered calcareous palagonitic\r\nclay-tuff.[84] The larger fragments in it average only ·2 mm., and it\r\naffords evidence of a period of submergence during which the hill-tops\r\nof the Savu-savu Peninsula were below the sea-level.\r\n\r\nWe get the same indication, but in a more pronounced degree, in the\r\nstratified sedimentary clay-tuffs which are exposed on the shore-flat of\r\nthe south side of the neighbouring Sava-reka-reka Bay. These beds, which\r\nwithin a distance of fifty paces are inclined 10-15° to the south-west\r\nand the same amount to the north-west, have apparently a quâquâversal\r\ndip. In places they exhibit a spheroidal and concentric structure, and\r\nare penetrated by cracks containing some calcite, but mostly filled with\r\na white zeolitic mineral.[85] One of these rocks is a bright green, hard\r\nand compact deposit, containing but little lime, and evidently an\r\naltered palagonitic clay-tuff. It contains a few minute tests of the\r\n“Globigerina” type; and on account of the small size of its fragments of\r\nminerals, which range from .01 to .04 mm., it may be regarded as a\r\nrelatively deep-water sediment.[86] It is interstratified with a\r\ncoarser, somewhat altered palagonite-tuff, which shows but little lime\r\nand only a suspicion of tests of foraminifera. The size of the larger\r\nincluded fragments does not exceed half a millimetre.... The low hill,\r\nnear Yaroi, on which the magistrate’s house is built, is composed of\r\nfine and coarse tuffs, probably submarine. It is doubtful whether any\r\nbut sedimentary tuffs occur in this peninsula.\r\n\r\nIn the hills of the western part of the peninsula, that is, west of Na\r\nKama and Naithekoro, a particular type of basaltic andesite prevails,\r\ncharacterised by rhombic pyroxene as well as augite phenocrysts, and\r\nreferred for the most part to genus 13 of the hypersthene-augite\r\nandesites. Their specific gravity ranges from 2·76 to 2·83, and the\r\ninterstitial glass may be fair or scanty in amount. The average length\r\nof the felspar-lathes is unusually small, ·04-·06 mm. In these respects\r\nthe basaltic andesites of the Savu-savu Peninsula differ from the\r\nbasaltic andesites found in most other parts of the island, where, as\r\nexemplified by those of the Wainunu, Solevu, and Seatura regions, the\r\nfelspar-lathes average between ·1 and ·2 mm. in length, and there is\r\npractically no rhombic pyroxene. A somewhat scoriaceous semi-vitreous\r\nform of pyroxene andesite is exposed on the south slopes above\r\nNukumbalavu, where it is covered by basic agglomerates. The pyroxene in\r\nthe groundmass is here prismatic, and not granular, and for the most\r\npart rhombic; and the rock is referred to the prismatic sub-order of the\r\nhypersthene-augite andesites described on p. 287.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic andesites of the peninsula are often extensively decomposed\r\nthrough the weathering process, a spheroidal structure being then\r\ndisplayed. It rarely happens that the basaltic rocks of this locality\r\nassume a propylitic character. Yet, if this change is due to\r\nhydrothermal metamorphism, we ought to find altered rocks of this kind\r\nin the vicinity of the boiling-springs. Such rocks did not come under my\r\nnotice at the surface; but this only indicates that if this alteration\r\nhas taken place here, it has been effected at some depth; and, indeed,\r\nit would seem probable that the alteration known as “propylitic” is a\r\nchange produced generally in deep-seated rocks.\r\n\r\nA semi-ophitic basaltic andesite that is exposed in the small\r\nstream-course at the back of the springs, and not 100 yards distant,\r\ndisplays no propylitic change, and is only affected by hydration. The\r\nbasaltic andesites found on the hill-slopes further inland from the\r\nsprings exhibit no change of such a nature. However, rocks of this\r\ndescription occur at and near the coast about a mile to the westward.\r\nOne of them, which is light green in colour, might be taken for a\r\nlimestone, since it effervesces with an acid. When examined in the slide\r\nit is shown to be the prevailing basaltic andesite greatly altered. The\r\nporphyritic rhombic pyroxene is replaced by viriditic material; the\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts are replaced by calcite, secondary silica, and\r\nother alteration products; and the structure of the groundmass is\r\ndisguised by chalcedony, calcite, viridite, &c. Another rock from this\r\nlocality displays great alteration. The structure of the groundmass is\r\nobscured by secondary silica, and is traversed by fine cracks passing\r\nthrough the felspar phenocrysts and filled with blood-red films of\r\nhematite.\r\n\r\nOn the hill-slopes behind Harman’s Point, at an elevation of 300 to 400\r\nfeet, blocks of a reddish, volcanic rock, greatly altered by the\r\ndeposition of silica, were displayed on the surface. The ground was here\r\nstrewn in places with beautiful pyramidal prisms of clear quartz,\r\nranging up to an inch in length. They contain numerous inclusions, their\r\nfaces being sometimes deeply etched or eroded. These crystals appear to\r\nhave been formed rather rapidly in some highly siliceous thermal\r\nunderground waters.\r\n\r\nI did not ascend the hills of the portion of the peninsula lying east of\r\nNa Kama and Naithekoro. But whilst crossing the saddle between these two\r\nplaces, I perceived that the prevailing basaltic andesites extended up\r\nthe slopes to the east. The neighbourhood of Naindi Bay offers several\r\nfeatures of interest. The bay, which is circular in shape, is closed in\r\non the east and west by projecting points, where we find elevated\r\nreef-limestone, 40 or 50 feet above the sea, displaying massive corals\r\nand large “Tridacna” shells in their natural position, and overlaying a\r\ncement-stone composed of blocks of volcanic rocks in a calcareous\r\nmatrix. On the beach on the west side of the bay there is exposed a\r\nreddish-grey altered pyroxene-andesite, which, as regards the size of\r\nthe felspars of the groundmass and other characters, appears to be an\r\naltered form of the prevailing basaltic andesites of the peninsula. In\r\nthe midst of the low passage that isolates the peninsula, which I have\r\ntermed the Naindi Gap, there is displayed a highly altered basic\r\nandesite which contains a white, zeolitic mineral in its numerous\r\ncracks.\r\n\r\nThe small island of Na-Wi consists of two low hills, the highest 130\r\nfeet in height, connected by a mangrove swamp and a sandy beach. There\r\nis no trace of a crateral cavity. The prevailing rock is a porphyritic,\r\ncompact, basic andesite, differing from the other rocks of the\r\nneighbourhood in the greater amount of glass it contains. Though it is\r\nnot easy to find a good, unweathered specimen of the rock, it would\r\nappear that Na-Wi represents an old volcanic neck.\r\n\r\nWe may infer from the above description of this peninsula that it has a\r\nhistory similar to that of most other parts of the island. There is\r\nevidence in the upraised reefs and in the “Globigerina” clays and\r\nlimestones of considerable submergence at one period; and it is highly\r\nprobable that the prevailing basaltic andesites are the products of\r\nsubmarine eruptions. In my account of the hot springs given on page 26,\r\nreference is made to the absence of any trace of a crateral cavity in\r\nthat locality. The same is true, as far as my observation goes, of the\r\nwhole peninsula. Altered rocks do not occur in the vicinity of the\r\nsprings, but they are to be found at distances a mile and more away. It\r\ndoes not seem possible to restore in imagination the original form of\r\nthis part of the island. The present contours are the results of more\r\nthan one reshaping of the surface through the agencies of marine erosion\r\nand sub-aerial denudation.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE DISTRICT BETWEEN NAINDI BAY AND THE SALT LAKE\r\n\r\nThree or four of the peaks of this hilly district rise to about 1,000\r\nfeet or rather over, the highest being that of Na Suva-suva, which\r\nattains a height of 1,110 feet. Since my acquaintance with this region\r\nis incomplete, I will confine my remarks to the localities actually\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Mr. F. Spence, I was able to make use of a track\r\ncleared to the top of Na Suva-suva. This eminence, which forms a\r\nconspicuous landmark for many miles, both landward and seaward, has a\r\nrounded summit and is to all appearance an old volcanic neck. It is\r\ncomposed in mass in its upper half of a heavy dark olivine-basalt (sp.\r\ngr. 3·01), seemingly non-columnar, and referred to the highly basic\r\nrocks forming genus 16 of the olivine-basalts. There is such a thick\r\nsoil-cap on the lower slopes that I was unable to ascertain the\r\ncharacter of the rocks there. It is, however, noteworthy that a very\r\nsimilar olivine-basalt (sp. gr. 2·99) crops out on the coast south of\r\nthis hill and to the east of Naindi Bay. They both contain abundant\r\nsmall olivine-phenocrysts and a little residual glass, the\r\nfelspar-lathes averaging ·1-·14 mm. in length. Since their localities\r\nare rather more than a mile apart, it is not possible to say without a\r\nfurther examination of the locality whether or not we have here the same\r\nintrusion.\r\n\r\nOn the coast between Naindi Bay and Salt Lake Passage, calcareous tuffs,\r\nprobably fossiliferous, are occasionally exposed in the low spurs\r\ndescending to the sea, whilst islets of elevated reef-rock front the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nThe coast immediately west of the Salt Lake Passage is of exceptional\r\ninterest. Here the sea-cliffs and the shore-flat are formed of an\r\nagglomerate tuff penetrated in all directions by veins of calcite, an\r\ninch and under in thickness. The matrix of this deposit, which is a\r\nlittle calcareous, is principally made up of fragments, ranging up to 3\r\nor 4 millimetres in size, of vacuolar palagonite, the minute vesicles\r\nbeing filled with some alteration product. It also contains large macled\r\naugite crystals 5 or 6 mm. in size, which can be picked out in numbers\r\nby the fingers. The blocks vary from a few inches to two feet across,\r\nand are usually composed of an augite-andesite, containing large\r\nporphyritic crystals of augite, and are often amygdaloidal, the\r\namygdules, 3 or 4 mm. in size, being formed of a zeolite. But blocks of\r\nvery different rocks also occur in this agglomerate tuff. One, about two\r\nfeet across, was composed of a coarsely crystalline diorite made up, as\r\ndescribed on page 251, of large crystals of hornblende, 2 to 2·5\r\ncentimetres long, and of large opaque crystals of acid labradorite.\r\nAnother was made of hornblende-hypersthene andesite belonging to the\r\northo-phyric order of that sub-class (see page 299). There is a little\r\naltered glass in the groundmass, and large secretions of brown\r\nhornblende, more than an inch in size, are to be observed in the rock.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this singular deposit represents a submarine\r\naccumulation of materials ejected from some neighbouring vent. Organic\r\nremains did not come under my notice; but apart from the palagonitic\r\ncharacter of the matrix and the abundance of veins of calcite, the\r\nsubmarine origin is indicated by the existence of upraised reefs in the\r\ncoast districts east and west of this locality. The block of diorite\r\naffords an important clue as to the character of the deep-seated\r\nplutonic rocks in this part of the island. A similar diorite was found\r\nby me amongst the blocks in the bed of the Vunimbua River; and on page\r\n185, reference is made to the probability of such rocks forming the\r\nnucleus of the Valanga Range.\r\n\r\nThe hills on the west side of the Salt Lake are worth further\r\nexamination. On the coast of the Natewa Bay side of this district,\r\nin the vicinity of Vuni-tangaloa and between that place and\r\nVuni-sawana, there are displayed agglomerates formed of blocks of\r\nhornblende-andesite, some of the specimens being very similar to\r\nthat obtained from the block of hornblende-andesite noticed in the\r\nagglomerate-tuff on the neighbouring south coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE SALT LAKE\r\n\r\nThe low isthmus, about 2½ miles in breadth, which connects the Natewa\r\nPeninsula with the rest of the island, can be crossed without rising\r\nmore than 40 or 50 feet above the sea. From the occurrence of upraised\r\nreefs in the islets and in the low sea-cliffs of the south coast it may\r\nbe inferred that at no distant period in the history of Vanua Levu this\r\nisthmus was submerged.\r\n\r\nThe lake, which is oblong in form, is about four-fifths of a mile long\r\nand about two-fifths broad. Its maximum depth according to the Admiralty\r\nchart is 3 fathoms; but the usual depth in the centre varies, as I\r\nfound, between 2 and 2½ fathoms. It communicates with the sea on the\r\nsouth coast by a long narrow passage, rather over a mile in length,\r\nwhich for the greater part of its course, excepting near its seaward\r\nmouth, is only between 25 and 30 feet broad. Mangroves flourish around\r\nthe lake and also line the passage; whilst elevated reef-rock is to be\r\nobserved on the sides of the passage. Mr. Horne was informed that corals\r\nabound in the lake-waters; but I find no reference to this point in my\r\nnotes. Judging from the density of the effluent water, the specific\r\ngravity of the lake-water is that of the sea. The “rise and fall,” as\r\nnoticed below, is considerably less than in the case of the tides at the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nNear the centre of the lake there is a low islet, some 40 paces across,\r\nand only raised about a foot above the level of the lake at the time of\r\nhigh-water. It is chiefly made up of coral blocks; but there are a few\r\nfragments of basaltic andesite lying about, which were probably brought\r\nthere by natives. This islet is mentioned in Mrs. Smythe’s account[87]\r\nof the visit made by Colonel Smythe to the lake in 1860; and by reason\r\nof its little elevation it may be accepted as a rude datum-mark of the\r\nrelative level of land and sea in this region. From this it would appear\r\nthat there has been no appreciable change of level in this region for\r\nthe last forty years.\r\n\r\nExcept on the north and north-west sides, the lake is more or less\r\nsurrounded by hills reaching up to 400 or 500 feet, the passage\r\nrepresenting a break in the range. On the Natewa Bay side the level of\r\nthe surface is much lower. The low strip of land that intervenes between\r\nthe north-west corner of the lake and Natewa Bay is about a mile across,\r\nand does not attain a greater elevation than 40 or 50 feet above the\r\nsea. On its surface, fragments of basic volcanic rocks are displayed;\r\nbut no reef debris came under my notice. At its north-east side the lake\r\nis only separated from Natewa Bay by a neck of land 300 to 400 yards in\r\nbreadth and about 100 feet high. It was across this neck that the\r\nnatives in old times used to drag their large canoes.\r\n\r\nMr. Horne[88] who visited this neighbourhood in 1878, suggested that the\r\nSalt Lake occupies a crater-cavity. The hills around are of volcanic\r\nformation, and I am rather inclined to support this view; but certainty\r\nis scarcely possible now, on account of the great degradation which the\r\nsurface has evidently experienced during and since the emergence; whilst\r\nsubsequent reef-growth has also to some extent masked the original form\r\nof the district. It is noteworthy that a somewhat parallel condition of\r\nthings is presented a few miles to the west by the circular Naindi Bay\r\nand the low passage, not more than 50 feet above the sea, that partly\r\nisolate the Savu-savu Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar behaviour of the tides in connection with the Salt Lake and\r\nits passage attracted my attention during two visits to this locality.\r\nOn the first occasion I noticed that between two and three hours after\r\nthe tide at the coast had commenced to rise there was still a strong\r\nflow through the passage from the lake, and that the current was only\r\nreversed in the latter half of the rising tide. During my second visit\r\nat the end of May, 1899, when I was accompanied by Mr. Smallwood, I\r\nspent a night in observing the behaviour of the spring tides at a spot\r\nbelow the narrow portion of the passage 600 or 700 yards from the\r\nopening on the coast. Here the breadth was about 100 feet, the depth at\r\nlow-water 5 feet, and the rise of the tide 4 feet. The current ran\r\nseaward at a velocity varying from 1,500 to 2,500 yards per hour; and it\r\ncontinued to flow in this direction for 2½ hours after the tide had\r\nbegun to rise on the coast. (In the narrow part of the passage the rate\r\nof the current would probably be not over 3 knots.) It is curious that\r\nat the place of measurement the bottom was formed of mud into which the\r\npole sank six feet without striking a hard substratum. The observations\r\non the current were made with a vertical float immersed about 3 feet.\r\n\r\nThe point of difficulty in the behaviour of the tides is this. The water\r\nis running rapidly out of the lake for nine hours; whilst during the\r\nremaining three hours there is a sluggish return-flow up the passage\r\ninto the lake. A far greater quantity of water finds an exit by the\r\npassage than is returned by the same channel; and I can only explain\r\nthis by assuming that there is an extensive percolation of water from\r\nNatewa Bay into the lake. It is easy to show that with such a narrow\r\neffluent, which cannot have a sectional area exceeding 180 square feet,\r\nthe level of the lake would be only lowered 2 or 3 feet, if the average\r\nvelocity during the nine hours was two nautical miles. The great bulk of\r\nthe water would thus remain unchanged. The ultimate result of such\r\nconditions would be a lake of brine. Since, however, the sea-water of\r\nthe lake possesses the ordinary density, it is apparent for this reason\r\nonly that there is some other means of supply than by the present narrow\r\npassage leading to the sea. The mean level of the Salt Lake is evidently\r\nrather above that of the sea, perhaps a foot or two; and the\r\n“rise-and-fall” is probably very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE NATEWA PENINSULA\r\n\r\nTHIS remarkable peninsula is connected with the rest of the island by\r\nthe low-lying Salt Lake district, a narrow isthmus, described in the\r\npreceding chapter, which one can cross without rising 50 feet above the\r\nsea. My acquaintance with this region is far from complete; but from the\r\nfollowing notes a fair general idea of its geological characters may be\r\ngathered.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the map it will be seen that there are three groups of\r\nmountains. The north-eastern culminates in Mount Freeland or Ngala,\r\n2,740 feet; the southern is formed by the rugged Waikawa Range, 1,540\r\nfeet; whilst the Lea Range to the west attains in Ngalau-levu a height\r\nof 1,960 feet. They are much cut up by the denuding agencies, and all\r\nbear the stamp of an ancient land-surface. Though hot springs are not\r\ninfrequent, as at Ndreke-ni-wai, Waikatakata, Ndevo, and Navuni, no\r\nevidence of recent volcanic action came under my notice. Submarine\r\ndeposits occur at intervals on the surface up to elevations of 1,000\r\nfeet and over; but with the exception of the comparatively recent\r\nupheaval or emergence of some 20 or 30 feet, indicated by the raised\r\nreef-masses and foraminiferous tuffs and clays in different parts of the\r\ncoast, there is nothing to suggest that these changes did not occur ages\r\nsince. In the frequent alteration of its andesitic rocks, and in the\r\noccasional occurrence of porphyrites, we have sufficient indication of\r\nthe antiquity of this part of the island as far as its volcanic history\r\nis concerned.\r\n\r\nI will commence the description of this peninsula at its western end.\r\n\r\nThe broken elevated district that extends eastward from the Salt Lake to\r\nFawn Harbour on the south coast, and to the mouth of the Ndreke-ni-wai\r\nRiver on the north coast, is divided into two principal masses, which\r\nare connected by a ridge or _col_ about 400 feet above the sea, which is\r\nsituated a little east of Viene. The western portion, which may be named\r\nthe Viene sub-district, attains a maximum height of 1,000 feet. The\r\neastern portion reaches in the peak of Ngalau-levu, a height of 1,960\r\nfeet, and may be termed the Lea sub-district.\r\n\r\nTHE VIENE SUB-DISTRICT.—The cliffs on the north coast between Muanaira\r\nand a little east of Viene are mainly formed of basic tuffs, often\r\ncalcareous. At a place about 1½ miles east of Viene, these tuffs as\r\nexposed in a coast spur display large flat spiral tests of shallow-water\r\nforaminifera 4 or 5 millimetres across. They may be described in this\r\nlocality as palagonitic calcareous tuff-sandstones, more or less\r\ncompacted, and containing fragments of palagonitised basic rocks. When\r\ncrossing the _col_ above referred to one finds similar palagonitic\r\ncalcareous sandstones and clays exposed on its slopes up to its summit\r\n(400 feet).\r\n\r\nOn the south side, in the vicinity of Vunilangi Inlet, foraminiferous\r\nclays and reef-limestones are displayed at the foot of the slopes; and\r\nthe coast between this place and Tathelevu to the westward is bordered\r\nby low cliffs of reef-limestone raised 6 to 8 feet above the high-water\r\nmark and displaying massive corals in their position of growth. Near\r\nTathelevu there occur raised reefs 10 to 15 feet above the sea; whilst\r\nthe hills, 250 to 300 feet in height, at the back of this place are\r\ncomposed of fine and coarse tuffs and tuff-sandstones containing little\r\nor no lime, and apparently no organic remains. They are sedimentary\r\ntuffs of mixed composition, made up of fragments of plagioclase, rhombic\r\nand monoclinic pyroxene, brown hornblende, portions of semi-vitreous\r\nbasic andesite, and palagonitic debris. In the lower levels they are\r\nfine textured with a grain of ·2 to ·3 mm. In the higher part their\r\ngrain is ·5 to 1 mm., and they are more basic in character and come near\r\nto the palagonite-tuffs. At an elevation of 200 feet they form inland\r\ncliffs, 50 feet high, in which are imbedded blocks, 2 feet across, of a\r\nblackish pyroxene-andesite with a specific gravity of 2·73, and\r\nbelonging to the prismatic sub-order of the orthophyric order of the\r\nhypersthene-augite andesites. It is remarkable for the pyroxene prisms\r\nof the groundmass, and shows a little interstitial glass. These cliffs\r\nare well displayed behind Navelatha, about half a mile from Tathelevu.\r\nBetween this locality and the Salt Lake Passage, elevated\r\nreef-limestones, forming low cliffs 6 to 8 feet high, together with\r\noccasional tuff-agglomerates, occur at the coast.\r\n\r\nTHE LEA SUB-DISTRICT.—This region, which includes the mountain-range of\r\nNgalau-levu at the back of Lea, is limited by Fawn Harbour and Vunilangi\r\nInlet on the south coast, and by the Ndreke-ni-Wai River and a point\r\nbetween Viene and Lea on the north coast. Its structure, as is shown\r\nbelow, is very complicated, acid and basic rocks being associated in a\r\nremarkable manner; whilst over all lie the submarine tuffs. Marine and\r\nsub-aerial denuding agencies have shaped and re-shaped the surface to\r\nsuch a degree that it is now impossible to restore it in imagination.\r\n\r\nOn the north coast of this sub-district, about two miles east of Viene,\r\nis exposed an altered darkish porphyrite displaying large opaque\r\ncrystals of plagioclase, 5 to 7 mm. long, the rock-mass being penetrated\r\nby fine veins of chalcedonic quartz, which also traverse the\r\nphenocrysts. Its specific gravity is 2·6; but on account of the\r\nimperfect development of the felspar-lathes and the amount of altered\r\nglass in the groundmass, which also contains a little calcite, it can be\r\nonly generally referred to the augite-andesites. A greenish altered\r\nforaminiferous tuff showing fine cracks filled with chalcedony composes\r\na spur in this locality. A propylitic or highly altered dolerite is\r\nexposed half-way between Viene and Lea.\r\n\r\nAs one nears Lea from the west the lofty spurs of the mountain of\r\nNgalau-levu reach the coast, and basic tuffs and agglomerates prevail.\r\nThe blocks in the agglomerate are composed of a vesicular semi-vitreous\r\nhypersthene-augite andesite, which is assigned to the second prismatic\r\nsub-order, since it carries prismatic pyroxene in the groundmass. The\r\ntown of Lea is picturesquely situated on the coast at the foot of the\r\nsteep mountain-slopes, being closed in on the east and west by elevated\r\nspurs descending to the sea. Fragments of jasper and chalcedony occur in\r\nthe beds of the streams that here drain the precipitous sides of the\r\nrange. Two dykes of dark basic rocks protrude through the beach in Lea\r\nBay. They are composed of augite-andesites referred to genus 13 of the\r\naugite-class; but the two rocks belong to different species of that\r\ngenus. In the one the felspar-lathes are only ·04 mm. in length, and\r\nthere is a little altered glass in the groundmass, the specific gravity\r\nbeing 2·63. In the other the felspar-lathes average ·2 mm. in length,\r\nand the rock has a coarser texture, whilst the specific gravity is 2·7.\r\nThe augite granules are large (·03 mm.), and there are irregular lacunar\r\nspaces filled with calcite and lined by a brown palagonite-like\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nI ascended the second highest peak of the Ngalau-levu mountain, which\r\nrises to a height of 1,680 feet behind the town of Lea, the highest\r\nsummit lying to the eastward. Ngalau-lailai, which I also ascended, is a\r\nlesser peak, 1,400 feet in height, situated yet nearer to the town.\r\nBasic tuffs and agglomerates similar to those exposed in the western\r\nspur of the bay occurred all the way up to the bare rocky pinnacles\r\nforming the summits. The blocks in the agglomerates are made up of a\r\nsemi-vitreous augite-andesite, which is sometimes scoriaceous or\r\namygdaloidal, and at other times pseudo-vesicular. Augite crystals, 5 or\r\n6 millimetres in length, are inclosed in the tuffs which contain\r\npalagonitised materials, but apparently no organic remains.\r\n\r\nIn the spur on the east side of Lea Bay occurs a light-coloured altered\r\nhornblende andesite. The brown hornblende is mostly represented by black\r\npseudomorphs. Such a rock appears in strange contrast with its basic\r\nsurroundings. This is followed, as one proceeds eastward along the\r\ncoast, by basic tuffs and agglomerates. It should have been before\r\nobserved that blocks of a blackish-brown olivine basalt (sp. gr. 2·89),\r\nreferred to genus 13 of the olivine class, occur at intervals on the\r\ncoast between Viene and Ndreke; but the rock never presented itself in\r\nposition. The tiny felspar-lathes (·03 mm. long) are in flow\r\narrangement; but there is little or no residual glass, and the augite\r\ngranules (·01 mm.) occur in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the way between Lea and Ndreke-ni-wai there lie\r\nclose to the shore two islets, 20 to 25 feet high, of reef-limestone, in\r\nwhich massive corals may be observed in their position of growth.\r\nFurther east, about half a mile west of Ndreke-ni-wai, there is exposed\r\nat the coast a bedded light-coloured non-calcareous compacted tuff-rock,\r\ndipping 12° to 15° to the southward. It contains pebbles and blocks of\r\nacid and basic andesitic rocks, and may be described as an altered\r\nhornblende-andesite tuff. Basic agglomerates occur as one approaches\r\nNdreke-ni-wai. This town lies at the mouth of the river of that name,\r\nthe first river that one meets on the north side of this peninsula.\r\nThere exist here between the tide-marks some hot springs, to which\r\nreference is made on page 34.\r\n\r\nWhen crossing the Natewa peninsula from Ndreke-ni-wai to the head of\r\nFawn Harbour, one reaches a height of 660 feet above the sea. This ridge\r\nrepresents the “divide” between the Lea and Waikawa mountain-ranges. In\r\nthe lower part of the northern slopes of this ridge occur basic tuffs\r\nand agglomerates; but between 200 and 400 feet a light-coloured acid\r\nrock of the hornblende-andesite type prevails, both in the form of\r\nagglomerate and of loose blocks. This rock is described under the second\r\norder of the hornblende-hypersthene andesites on page 299.\r\n\r\nDescending the south slope, I found at an elevation of 500 feet a single\r\nlarge mass, about 4 feet across, of quite another type of volcanic rock,\r\nwhich is referred to the orthophyric order of the hypersthene-augite\r\nandesites (page 290). It is a dark grey almost holo-crystalline rock\r\n(sp. gr. 2·69) showing porphyritic pyroxene to the eye and displaying in\r\nits relatively scanty groundmass short stout felspars, ·05 mm. in\r\nlength. On the surface of the lower two-thirds of this southern slope\r\noccur basic tuffs and agglomerates, basaltic blocks being found in the\r\nstreams. The tuffs are palagonitic and contain a few calcareous\r\nparticles. They apparently contain some foraminiferous shells and are\r\ndoubtless of submarine origin.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the axis or deeper portion of this ridge is composed\r\nof the hornblende and hypersthene-augite andesites, whilst the basic\r\ntuffs and agglomerates form the slopes.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the south side of the Lea sub-district, it may be\r\nobserved that whilst on the north side the mountains rise up close to\r\nthe sea-border, here they are separated from the coast by a broad tract\r\nof lowland, where bedded pteropod and foraminiferous clay-rocks are\r\nexposed, dipping gently to the south-east. Usually between Fawn Harbour\r\nand Vunilangi Inlet the coast is margined by low cliffs of\r\ncoral-limestone, showing the massive corals in position; but sometimes\r\nthe deposits above noticed compose the low cliffs and even the islets\r\nclose by.\r\n\r\nTHE WAIKAWA MOUNTAINS.—This range occupies nearly the whole area of the\r\nbroad and elevated promontory that is only separated from Taviuni by the\r\nnarrow straits of Somo-somo, which, however, have a minimum depth of 120\r\nfathoms. These mountains extend to the vicinity of Mbutha Bay on one\r\nside and to near Fawn Harbour on the other. Several of the peaks reach\r\nto over 1,000 feet, the greatest height given in the Admiralty chart\r\nbeing 1,540 feet. The whole region has a very rugged aspect, the\r\nmountains rising up near the coast, whilst the surface is much cut up\r\ninto ridges and valleys.\r\n\r\nA single traverse across the range was alone made, but the results\r\nobtained are very suggestive and may doubtless be applied to much of\r\nthis rugged promontory. I crossed the mountains from Loa to Waikawa. The\r\nsummit was about a mile broad and undulating, the level varying between\r\n900 and 1,150 feet. At one place on the top there was a deep hollow,\r\nsome 300 or 400 yards across, perhaps the remains of an old\r\ncrater-cavity; but the higher slopes were so densely wooded that it was\r\nnot possible to get a clear view of my surroundings. Basic tuffs and\r\nagglomerates prevailed on either side from the foot to the top of the\r\nrange. Specimens obtained from between 800 and 900 feet above the sea\r\nare characteristic palagonitic tuffs of varying degrees of coarseness\r\ncontaining 5 to 10 per cent. of carbonate of lime and a few tests of\r\nforaminifera. At 1,100 feet I obtained a specimen which on account of\r\nthe large proportion of carbonate of lime (35 per cent.) and the\r\nabundance of foraminiferal tests may be termed an impure foraminiferal\r\nlimestone belonging to the group of these rocks described on page 319.\r\nThe tests range up to a millimetre in size, and there are also inclosed\r\na few large fragments, 1 to 2 centimetres in size, of shells and\r\ncrystalline limestone. The residue is made of the detritus of\r\nsemi-vitreous basic rocks, palagonitic debris, fine clayey material and\r\nminerals (15 per cent.), the last including beside plagioclase abundant\r\nmore or less perfect pyroxene prisms, mostly of the rhombic type.\r\n\r\nNear the summit there occurred in one place blocks of a highly basic\r\nblackish olivine-basalt (sp. gr. 2·99), marking evidently the situation\r\nof a dyke. This rock is referred to genus 13 of the olivine-class. It\r\ndisplays abundant phenocrysts of olivine and augite with but little\r\nplagioclase. Interstitial glass is scanty, the groundmass consisting of\r\nstoutish felspar-lathes (·06 mm. long), abundant augite granules and\r\nprisms, and magnetite.\r\n\r\nThe Waikawa mountains would thus seem to possess the same general\r\nstructure that characterises many of the ranges of the island. Submarine\r\nbasic tuffs and agglomerates cover their sides and their summits, the\r\ndeeper rocks forming the axis of the range being in this case not so\r\nfrequently exposed.\r\n\r\nOn the coast between Waikawa and Navuni, rather over a mile east of Fawn\r\nHarbour, basic agglomerates, palagonitic tuff-sandstones, and calcareous\r\nclay-rocks containing pteropod and foraminiferous tests, prevail. The\r\ntuff-sandstones and clay-rocks are bedded, the stratification being\r\noften well shown in the horizontal sections displayed in the shore-flat.\r\nIn one locality within an area a few hundred yards across, a\r\nquaquaversal dip was exhibited. At Navuni, where the hills reach the\r\ncoast, the same formations occur. I ascended the stream-course there for\r\nabout a mile, basic tuffs and agglomerates being exposed in its sides,\r\nwhilst blocks of a heavy dark olivine-basalt[89] lay in the bed. The hot\r\nsprings which issue inland at the side of this stream are described on\r\npage 35.\r\n\r\nTHE BASIN OF THE NDREKE-NI-WAI RIVER.—With the region, which is bounded\r\non the north by the Mount Freeland Range or the Ngala mountains and on\r\nthe south by the Waikawa Range, I have but slight acquaintance, except\r\nin the case of the coast fronting Natewa Bay. A little way up the course\r\nof the river Ndreke-ni-wai, which drains this area, lies the town of\r\nKoro-ni-yasatha, where Mr. Horne, the botanist, spent some days in 1878.\r\nProbably much of this area is not over 200 feet above the sea, and\r\napparently there is a good deal of talasinga country.\r\n\r\nTHE COAST BETWEEN THE MOUTH OF THE NDREKE-NI-WAI RIVER AND THE FOOT OF\r\nTHE NGALA OR MOUNT FREELAND RANGE.—Between this estuary and Valavala,\r\ntwo miles to the eastward, occurs a bedded calcareous palagonitic tuff\r\nof sedimentary origin, dipping steeply to the north. In one locality\r\nthere is a rudely columnar dyke of a porphyritic augite-andesite. Coarse\r\nbasic tuffs exposed in the cliffs and shore-flat of Ko-nandi-nandi Point\r\non the side of Valavala Bay display a spheroidal structure, due probably\r\nto the vicinity of some igneous intrusion. The sea-border extending from\r\nthis bay to Natewa, and farther on to Waikatakata, near the foot of the\r\nNgala mountains, is in most parts a broad low strip of coast-land, where\r\nrock-exposures are infrequent. A dark grey andesite forms the blocks of\r\nthe agglomerate in this locality. It is noticeable on account of the\r\nprismatic pyroxene of the groundmass; and it is assigned to genus 5 of\r\nthe second (prismatic) sub-order of the hypersthene-augite andesites. A\r\nblackish semi-vitreous pyroxene-andesite occurs in the vicinity of\r\nNatewa.\r\n\r\nAt Waikatakata (the Fijian word for “hot water”), where an outlying spur\r\nof the Mount Freeland or Ngala Range reaches the coast, hot springs\r\nissue on the hill-side, as described on page 34. On the slopes around\r\nthe springs lie huge masses of an aphanitic basaltic andesite having a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·81 and referred to genus 16 of the augite\r\nsub-class. It displays a characteristic andesitic groundmass, showing\r\ncrowded felspar-lathes in flow-arrangement with average length of\r\n·17 mm., and containing scarcely any residual glass.\r\n\r\nProceeding along the coast east of Waikatakata, one enters the region of\r\naltered pyroxene-andesites, for which Mount Freeland, or the Ngala\r\nRange, is remarkable. There are first to be observed on the shore blocks\r\nof a grey altered ophitic dolerite, which belongs to the non-porphyritic\r\ndivision of genus 10 of the augite-andesites and is described in detail\r\non page 275. Afterwards the characteristic rocks of the district occur.\r\nThe lofty spurs of the Ngala Range here reach the shore; and between\r\nthem lies the coast village of Ngara-vutu, from which the ascent to the\r\nsummit is best made.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   MOUNT FREELAND OR THE NGALA RANGE\r\n\r\nThis high range forms a conspicuous object in the profile of this part\r\nof the island. It derives its Fijian name from the old war-town of Ngala\r\nthat was situated at an elevation of 1,500 or 1,600 feet overlooking\r\nNgara-vutu on the west. The main mass of the range takes a crescentic\r\nsweep, 3 or 4 miles in extent and facing Natewa Bay. It incloses the\r\ncoast district of Tunuloa. The steep mountain-slopes here rise to 2,000\r\nfeet and over, the greatest elevation being 2,740 feet. The densely\r\nwooded spurs of the range occupy most of the area between the town of\r\nNatewa, Kumbulau Point, and Mbutha Bay.\r\n\r\nThe summit is a long narrow ridge covered with a dense entangled mass of\r\nFreycinetia stems which render progress very difficult. The rocks\r\nexposed all the way up from the stream-courses in the vicinity of\r\nNgara-vutu to the top, are almost all of the same type, namely altered\r\naugite-andesites. They are dark grey in colour and effervesce slightly\r\nwith an acid, whilst occasionally they show a little pyrites.[90]\r\nAgglomerates were not observed and tuffs only in one locality, 1,200\r\nfeet above the sea, where a highly altered tuff composed of debris of\r\nthe prevailing rocks was exposed. At an elevation of 500 feet there\r\noccurred a grey doleritic porphyritic rock, displaying large opaque\r\ncrystals of plagioclase, and looking like a porphyrite. It exhibits a\r\nsemi-ophitic groundmass, and is probably an intrusive mass. A\r\ndescription of it will be found under genus 10 of the augite-andesites\r\n(page 274).\r\n\r\nThe general petrological characters of the principal summit of Mount\r\nNgala point to its high antiquity as a volcanic mountain. It probably\r\nranks among the oldest extinct volcanic vents in the island.\r\n\r\nProceeding along the coast from Ngara-vutu to Navetau, the Buli’s town\r\nof the Tunuloa district, one observes blocks of basic rocks. Farther to\r\nthe eastward for a distance of two or three miles basic agglomerates and\r\nbasic tuff-agglomerates prevail along the sea-border, being often\r\nextensively exposed in the cliff-faces of the hills. The rock composing\r\nthe blocks is a hemi-crystalline pyroxene-andesite remarkable for the\r\nprismatic pyroxene in the groundmass, and referred to genus 17 of the\r\nhypersthene-augite sub-class.\r\n\r\nI crossed the range to Ndevo on the other side of the peninsula from a\r\nplace three or four miles west of Kumbulau Point, rising on the way to a\r\nheight of 930 feet. For the lower 300 feet on the north slope basic\r\nagglomerates and basic tuff-agglomerates are exposed. They are made up\r\nof the same materials as those above described on the coast. Near and at\r\nthe summit occur compacted brecciated tuffs made up of palagonitised\r\nbasic materials but containing no lime, and these are associated with\r\nlight greenish fine-textured hard tuffs of an acid character, but\r\nwithout lime or organic remains. In this last case the deposit is formed\r\nof mineral fragments (oligoclase, rhombic and monoclinic pyroxene, &c.),\r\nthe debris of a hemi-crystalline volcanic rock, and a quantity of\r\ngreenish alteration products.\r\n\r\nOn the south side in the vicinity of Ndevo the sea-border is composed of\r\ncalcareous palagonitic clays and tuffs containing pteropod shells and\r\nlarge tests of foraminifera in abundance. These deposits, which are\r\nhorizontally bedded, extend a mile inland and reach to between 250 and\r\n300 feet up the slopes. A hot spring is stated to occur between the\r\ntide-marks near Ndevo.\r\n\r\nAt intervals all along the coast between Ndevo and Nuku-ndamu, passing\r\non the way the villages of Koro-i-vonu, Tuvumila and Kanakana, fine and\r\ncoarse basic tuffs, often calcareous, are to be seen exposed in the\r\nsea-cliffs and in the low hills behind. They are bedded and dip 5° to\r\n10° W.S.W. near Ndevo and 15° to 20° S. b W. south of Kanakana. The\r\nlower slopes of the Ngala mountains here approach the coast, and it is\r\nhighly probable that the submarine tuffs which form the sea-border\r\nextend a considerable distance inland and to some height above the sea.\r\nBetween Nuku-ndamu and Tukavesi, where the mountains rise close to the\r\nbeach, occur basic agglomerates and agglomerate-tuffs, derived from\r\nbasaltic andesites. A specimen of the last named represents an uncommon\r\ntype of basaltic rock (sp. gr. 2·85), which on account of the character\r\nof the felspars and of the pyroxene of the groundmass is referred to the\r\nprismatic sub-order of the orthophyric order of the hypersthene-augite\r\nandesites (page 290).\r\n\r\nIt may be inferred from the foregoing remarks that whilst the main\r\nelevated mass of the Ngala Range is composed of altered basic andesites,\r\nthe product of ancient eruptions, the basic agglomerates, tuffs, and\r\nclays, which occur on the lower slopes and in the outlying spurs, are of\r\nlater date. These tuffs and clays are evidently of submarine origin, at\r\nleast in the lower levels; but although fossiliferous deposits were not\r\nobserved at greater elevations than 300 feet above the sea, it is\r\nprobable that future investigators will find them at much higher levels.\r\nTheir discovery, as before noticed, at an elevation of 1,100 feet in the\r\nadjacent Waikawa mountains, renders it likely that as in the case of the\r\nmountainous districts of the main portion of the island the whole of the\r\nNatewa peninsula was at one time submerged, or at least all the region\r\nexcepting the summit of Mount Ngala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE NORTH-EAST PORTION OF THE ISLAND\r\n\r\nTHIS large area, which extends for a distance of nearly forty miles from\r\nthe eastern slopes of the Mount Thurston Range to Undu Point, forms the\r\nregion closing in Natewa Bay on the north. It would be difficult to\r\nimagine an area of this size with a greater variety of surface or\r\nshowing such a lack of arrangement of its principal features. The hills\r\nand mountains on the north side gather at the coast, and extensive\r\ninland plains, raised but a few feet above the sea and strewn with\r\nsilicified corals, occupy a portion of its interior. A long valley with\r\na very small gradient extends nearly across its breadth; and the rivers\r\nare for the most part tidal estuaries fed, except in one or two cases,\r\nby insignificant streams. There is, however, a lofty range of\r\nridge-mountains in its broadest part attaining a height of 2,500 feet;\r\nwhilst away to the east stretches the great Undu Promontory singular for\r\nthe straightness of its form.\r\n\r\nVolcanic rocks of acid types, such as oligoclase-trachytes,\r\nquartz-porphyries, and white pumice-tuffs prevail in the northern part\r\nbetween Undu Point and the promontory opposite Mali Island. In the\r\nsouthern part, from the foot of Mount Thurston and Vuinandi to the\r\nvicinity of Tawaki, massive rocks and tuffs and agglomerates of basic\r\ncharacters predominate. Although my acquaintance with this area is\r\nincomplete, the data below given will be sufficient to enable a general\r\nidea to be formed of its structure. The more conspicuous features in its\r\ngeology will gradually come into prominence as the various localities\r\nvisited are described.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SOUTHERN SEA-BORDER BETWEEN VUINANDI AND THE VICINITY OF TAWAKI\r\n\r\nThe basic rocks, which characterise this long extent of coast, give\r\nplace about two miles west of Tawaki to the acid rocks. I will proceed\r\nmethodically with the description from Vuinandi eastward.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The coast between Vuinandi and Nakarambo._—Along this coast,\r\nspurs from the Mount Thurston Range reach the borders of Natewa Bay,\r\nforming a succession of small bays a mile or so across, on the shores of\r\nwhich are situated the villages and towns of Vuinandi, Ndaku-ndaku,\r\nKorotasere, and Nakarambo. The basaltic rocks characteristic of the\r\nvicinity of Vuinandi are predominant here; but agglomerates and tuffs\r\nare of rare occurrence, the prevailing rocks exposed in the spurs being\r\nfine textured basaltic andesites (sp. gr. 2·82). A calcareous tuff-clay\r\nis, however, to be observed in the east point of Vuinandi Bay, where it\r\nis apparently penetrated by a dyke of the above mentioned rock. In\r\nNdaku-ndaku Bay there issue from the shore-flat between the tide-marks\r\nsome hot springs which are referred to on page 34.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The coast between Nakarambo and Waimotu._—In this tract we meet\r\nwith rocks of a somewhat different character, though still basic in\r\ntheir type. Through the agglomerates and agglomerate-tuffs of the spurs\r\nprotrude coarsely crystalline grey pyroxene-andesites.[91] They are to\r\nsome degree altered, and are characterised by their abundant phenocrysts\r\nof plagioclase and of rhombic and monoclinic pyroxene, the groundmass\r\nbeing relatively scanty. The agglomerates are formed of similar\r\nmaterials. There is an interesting exposure in the point east of\r\nNakarambo. My specimens from this locality were unfortunately lost; but\r\nin my notes reference is made to the coarsely crystalline grey andesite\r\nabove noticed, to the later intrusion of a dark amygdaloidal rock, and\r\nto an altered calcareous tuff.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The coast between Waimotu and Natasa Bay._—A low belt of land\r\noften forms the sea-border. Between these two localities there is a\r\nbroad estuary, the village of Vanuavou being situated on the right side\r\nand Malati on the left side. Tuffs usually calcareous and probably\r\nsubmarine are here displayed together with basaltic andesites.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The coast between Natasa Bay and the vicinity of Tawaki._—This\r\nextensive stretch of sea-border, nearly 15 miles in length, is\r\ncharacterised by hilly spurs and long intervening low-lying tracts. The\r\nprevailing rocks exposed are tuff-clays, somewhat hard and altered, and\r\ncoarser basic tuffs sometimes calcareous and overlying the former. These\r\nsedimentary deposits, which are evidently submarine, are often bedded\r\nand have a fairly constant dip over most of this region of 10 to 15\r\ndegrees to N.W. or W.N.W. They are frequently pierced by dykes, 6 to 10\r\nfeet thick, of compact basic rocks. A specimen of one of these\r\ndyke-rocks from between Natasa and Vatu-karoa is a doleritic basalt with\r\nscanty olivine (sp. gr. 2·81)[92]; but the rock of the dykes east of\r\nVatu-karoa is less basic (sp. gr. 2·72), and may be described as an\r\naugite-andesite[93] with a doleritic structure in part disguised by\r\nalteration. Between Natasa and Sangani there is a remarkable exposure of\r\nan intrusive opaque white rhyolitic rock associated with altered tuffs.\r\nThis rock, which has undergone some degree of alteration, is described\r\non page 311. It is the only indication of the vicinity of a region of\r\nacid rocks that I came upon on this tract of coast. It probably, if\r\ntraced inland, would be found connected with the district of acid rocks.\r\nIn following along the coast, however, towards Undu Point, the region of\r\nacid rocks is not reached until within 2 or 3 miles west of Tawaki.\r\nReference should be made here to two hot springs that, as described on\r\npage 33, rise up on the coast at Natuvu, a little east of Lakemba.\r\n\r\n           THE INLAND MOUNTAINOUS REGION BETWEEN THE EASTERN\r\n      FOOT OF THE MOUNT THURSTON RANGE AND THE VICINITY OF TAWAKI\r\n\r\nThis inland region corresponds for the most part to the tract of coast\r\nbefore described between Vuinandi and the vicinity of Tawaki. We have\r\nhere a very much broken area traversed in a northerly and southerly\r\ndirection by mountain-ridges and penetrated in places on the north side\r\nby prolongations of the Wainikoro and Kalikoso plains. The two loftiest\r\nsummits, the Ndoendamu and Savu-riti peaks of the chart, rise\r\nrespectively to heights of 2,481 and 2,238 feet. The former is the Hale\r\nPeak of the Wilkes’ Expedition; but as regards the native names there is\r\nsome confusion and I have not been able to clear it up. Several of the\r\nlesser peaks rise to over a 1,000 feet, and four or five of them to\r\nrather over 1,500 feet.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the fixing of the positions of the more\r\nconspicuous peaks, the interior of this part of the island is\r\nunsurveyed. I was able to lay down my positions approximately; but\r\nbefore a systematic examination can be made of the geology of this\r\nregion a survey is necessary. Several traverses and ascents were made by\r\nme; but much more in the way of exploration remains to be done. I\r\nventure, however, to think that from the data below given a fairly\r\naccurate notion of some of the leading geological features of this\r\nregion may be formed. The districts visited will be described in their\r\norder from east to west.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The mountainous district east of the mountains of Vungalei and\r\nNailotha, extending to the vicinity of Tawaki._—Mr. Thomson[94] in his\r\nmap of the sea-border of this district shows a continuous coast range\r\nfrom near Tawaki to Natasa lying about two miles inland. This is the\r\nappearance when the region is seen in profile from a distance; but when\r\nviewed from an elevation in its interior its surface is seen to be for\r\nthe most part traversed by a series of mountainous and hilly ridges\r\ntrending roughly north and south, the greatest height not exceeding\r\n1,500 or 1,600 feet.\r\n\r\nThe geological character of the sea-border of this district has already\r\nbeen described on page 208. It is there shown that fine and coarse\r\nsedimentary tuffs, sometimes calcareous, and often penetrated by basic\r\ndykes, here prevail. Their general story is one of great denudation, and\r\nwe have the same testimony impressed on us when examining one of the\r\ninland mountain-ridges.\r\n\r\nI followed the crest of one of these ridges from the hamlet of Nawi, on\r\nthe headwaters of the Vui-na-savu River, in a south-easterly direction\r\nfor about 4 miles to the peak of Uthulanga, which overlooks Lakemba on\r\nthe shore of Natewa Bay. During the walk my level rose fairly gradually\r\nfrom that of Nawi, less than 100 feet above the sea, until near Lakemba,\r\nwhere a height of 1,400 feet was attained. Here the ridge abruptly\r\nterminates in the round-topped peak of Uthulanga, which rises steeply\r\nfrom its crest for another 150 feet or rather more, and has a\r\nprecipitous face on the southern side descending far down the\r\nmountain-slope. This peak, which is about 1,550 feet above the sea, when\r\nseen from the opposite shores of Natewa Bay is very conspicuous and\r\nlooks like a thumb or a nose. The first part of the Fijian name of this\r\npeak signifies a nose.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Nawi, from whence the ridge begins, is built on a low\r\nmound-like “rise,” which is composed of a dark-grey hypersthene-gabbro.\r\nSince plutonic rocks are of very rare occurrence in this island, the\r\nNawi gabbro has a particular interest. It belongs to the group of\r\nplutonic rocks described on page 250; and is to be referred to the more\r\nbasic kinds, its specific gravity being 2·84. In appearance it is like a\r\ndiallage-gabbro, and in the slide displays monoclinic and rhombic\r\npyroxene filling the interspaces between the large plagioclase crystals\r\nand undergoing respectively the diallage and bronzite stages of\r\nschillerisation. This rock forms the type of the group and need not be\r\nreferred to in more detail here. It should be added that in the bed of\r\nthe neighbouring river occur blocks of a basaltic andesite (sp. gr.\r\n2·86) referred to genus 1 of the hypersthene-augite andesites. It is a\r\nless crystalline form of the gabbro just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing rock exposed for the first 2 miles on the crest of the\r\nridge (by starting from Nawi) was a greenish porphyrite displaying large\r\nopaque crystals of oligoclase, but showing much alteration of the\r\npropylitic kind, its specific gravity being 2·5, but the structure of\r\nthe groundmass is much disguised. During the next mile, basic\r\nagglomerates and a massive hypersthene-augite andesite were exposed. The\r\nlast-named is semi-vitreous, and on account of the prismatic pyroxene of\r\nthe groundmass is placed in genus 5 of its sub-class. Its specific\r\ngravity is 2·7. In the last and fourth mile of the ridge was exposed a\r\ndark grey doleritic basalt (sp. gr. 2·85), which rings like clinkstone\r\nunder the hammer, and weathers in a honeycombed fashion. The\r\nfelspar-lathes average ·3 mm. in length, the residual glass being\r\nscanty. The pyroxene phenocrysts include some of rhombic pyroxene; and\r\nthe rock is therefore referred to genus 4 of the hypersthene-augite\r\nandesites. The actual peak of Uthulanga, as it rises abruptly about 150\r\nfeet from the end of the ridge, is of agglomerate, the blocks being\r\ncomposed of a compact grey andesite.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar succession of rocks displayed in this mountain-ridge along\r\nits length of four miles is worthy of notice. Neither vesicular nor\r\nscoriaceous rocks came under observation; and it is to be assumed that\r\nthere existed originally a line of submarine vents, some of them\r\nejecting acid and others basic materials. Mainly on account of the great\r\nmarine erosion during the period of emergence, but partly also on\r\naccount of the subsequent sub-aerial denudation, a plain ridge now\r\nrepresents this line of vents. Probably the peak of Uthulanga, which is\r\nevidently an old volcanic neck, represents the last of the stages in the\r\nvolcanic history of this ridge; but a very long period must have since\r\nelapsed. When, however, we look at the exposed gabbro at the other end\r\nof the ridge, we have to carry the period much farther back, since here\r\nthe superjacent surface volcanic rocks have been stripped off\r\ncompletely. On page 2 I have referred to an island in the Solomon Group\r\nwhere we have such a chain of ancient vents of acid and basic rocks. In\r\nthat case the forms of the separate hills indicating the original vents\r\nare still to be recognised. In this old mountain-ridge of Vanua Levu no\r\nsuch outlines remain except in the instance of the terminal peak.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Nailotha and Vungalei Range._—This lofty range, which towers\r\nabove all around it, attains a height of 2,481 feet in the peak of\r\nNailotha and of 2,238 feet in that of Ndrukau or Vungalei. The first is,\r\nas I infer, the Ndoendamu or Hale Peak of the charts; but it is\r\nuncertain whether the name Savu-riti should be applied to the northern\r\npeak of the range as it is in the charts, or whether it belongs to an\r\nindependent peak farther to the east. By the natives in the vicinity the\r\nnorthern peak is known as Ndrukau, and I have added the name of Vungalei\r\nfrom the village at its foot. The southern peak is that of Nailotha. The\r\nrange runs roughly north and south. It is, however, obvious that the\r\ninternal topography of this part of the island is but scantily known.\r\n\r\nBrief reference will first be made to the country bordering the range on\r\nthe north-west and west sides in the vicinity of the villages of\r\nVungalei and Tembe. In proceeding south from Kalikoso, which lies in the\r\nmidst of the low-lying Wainikoro plains, to Vungale one traverses this\r\nlevel district, of which the elevation is never more than 150 feet above\r\nthe sea and often much less. About a mile south-east of Kalikoso the\r\nlimit of the region of quartz-porphyries and of acid tuffs is passed and\r\nthe area of basic rocks is entered, a dark semi-vitreous\r\npyroxene-andesite with a flinty fracture prevailing at the surface as\r\nfar as Vungalei. This rock displays a few small phenocrysts of\r\noligoclase and pyroxenes in a blurred glassy groundmass exhibiting the\r\nfelspar and pyroxene microliths in process of development (sp. gr.\r\n2·46).\r\n\r\nVungalei itself is only elevated about 130 feet above the sea. In\r\nproceeding from this village to Tembe, lying about two miles S.S.W., one\r\ncrosses a line of hills, about 600 feet in height, which form a spur of\r\nthe main range. Basic agglomerates similar to those found on the slopes\r\nof Mount Vungalei, as described below, prevail in the district between\r\nthese two villages up to the top of the intervening hills. In places one\r\nnotices that they overlie the ordinary sedimentary deposit, known as\r\n“soapstone,” a slightly calcareous clay-tuff but showing no organic\r\nremains to the eye. The rock exposed in the stream-courses is a\r\nsemi-ophitic basaltic andesite (sp. gr. 2·74) which contains a\r\nconsiderable amount of interstitial glass.[95] When proceeding S.S.W.\r\nfrom Tembe on the way to Nandongo one passes on either hand, as\r\ndescribed on page 216, hills about 700 feet high displaying vertical\r\ncliffs formed of agglomerates over-lying finer sedimentary beds\r\napparently of the “soapstone” character.\r\n\r\nI made the ascent of Mount Vungalei from the village of that name. The\r\npeak is also known as Ndrukau. Basic agglomerates were exposed all the\r\nway up to an elevation of about 2,000 feet, where a bed of a somewhat\r\nscoriaceous basaltic andesite was displayed, the upper 200 feet being\r\ninaccessible but of the same agglomerate. At a height of 300 feet was\r\nobserved another layer of the same basaltic rock. These intercalated\r\nbeds appeared to be lava-flows rather than horizontal dykes. The\r\nagglomerates become less coarse in the upper part of the mountain where\r\nthey take the character of agglomerate-tuffs. The blocks are composed,\r\nlike those in many other parts of the island, of a dark semi-vitreous\r\nbasaltic andesite, but often scoriaceous. But the most remarkable\r\nfeatures of these agglomerates are the indications of two distinct\r\npauses in their deposition afforded by the occurrence at elevations of\r\n900 and 1,700 feet of a single horizontal bed, two to three feet thick,\r\nof coarse palagonite-tuffs. Each bed is exposed at the foot of a tall\r\ncliff of agglomerate forming a line of escarpment along the\r\nmountain-side. The larger fragments making up these tuffs are usually\r\nfrom 2 to 3 millimetres in size; but the process of palagonitisation is\r\nnot complete; and we find inclosed abundant angular pieces of a dark\r\nfresh tachylyte-glass, finely vesicular, and fusing readily in the\r\nordinary spirit-lamp flame. The tuffs contain little or no lime and\r\nseemingly no organic remains. In the lowest bed I noticed a little\r\nwater-worn gravel. Both beds pass gradually into the underlying\r\nagglomerate; but their upper limits are well defined and the agglomerate\r\ncommences abruptly.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that in the formation of the agglomerates there were two\r\npauses when they gradually gave place to deposits of fine detritus made\r\nup of a vesicular basic glass that has since been largely converted into\r\npalagonite. Then followed a sudden renewal of the agglomerate-producing\r\nprocess. We can scarcely doubt that the agglomerates, with their\r\nscoriaceous blocks, and the palagonite-tuffs are in the main the direct\r\nproducts of volcanic eruptions. The rival claim of marine denudation as\r\nthe agency concerned can be mostly but not altogether excluded. The\r\nagglomerates and tuffs of Mount Vungalei cannot be distinguished from\r\nthose so often described in the case of the great inland ranges of the\r\nother parts of the island, the submarine origin of which is frequently\r\ndemonstrated by the inclosed organic remains. It would seem that in the\r\ninstance of Vungalei these deposits took place around the shores of a\r\nvolcanic mountain that rose above the sea. On page 315 it is pointed out\r\nthat in Stromboli with its dribbling eruptions we have a good\r\nillustration of the manner in which such deposits could be formed.\r\n\r\nMy examination of the mountain of Nailotha was restricted to the lower\r\nslopes up to an elevation of 600 feet; but the results obtained are\r\nvery suggestive. When following up the stream-course on the way from\r\nTembe to the mountain one notices in its bed blocks of a\r\nlight-coloured rock like a compact quartzite. It is, however, a highly\r\naltered oligoclase-trachyte (sp. gr. 2·53) with its structure much\r\ndisguised by secondary quartz. This is the first intimation one gets,\r\non leaving behind the district of basic agglomerates about Tembe, of\r\nthe otherwise unexpected character of the acid rocks displayed in the\r\nlower part of Nailotha.[96]\r\n\r\nA torrent here cuts deeply into the mountain-side. At the base, between\r\n200 and 300 feet above the sea, a bluish-grey rather scoriaceous rock\r\nwith the steam-pores drawn out to a length of from 1 to 2 centimetres,\r\nis first exposed. Its specific gravity after allowing for the cavities\r\nis less than 2·6. It shows a groundmass partly disguised by secondary\r\nquartz and containing numerous small vesicles lined by quartz and filled\r\nwith viridite and epidote. Where the alteration is less advanced small\r\nparallel felspar-lathes with fine decomposing pyroxenes are shown. The\r\nlathes give extinctions of two or three degrees and average ·04 mm. in\r\nlength. In its somewhat scoriaceous nature, in the absence of\r\nphenocrysts, and in its less altered condition, this rock differs from\r\nthose exposed higher up the ravine; but it is evidently to be referred\r\nto the same acid type. At a height of 300 feet a light grey highly\r\naltered oligoclase-trachyte (sp. gr. 2·43) is exhibited. It contained\r\noriginally some phenocrysts of felspar and pyroxene, which, however,\r\nhave been more or less replaced by calcite, quartz, and other materials;\r\nwhilst the groundmass, originally hemi-crystalline but now blurred by\r\nthe deposition of silica, shows felspar-lathes in process of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nA little farther up the gorge there is displayed another highly altered\r\nrock with a siliceous appearance, such as has been noticed above as\r\nforming blocks in the stream near the foot of the mountain. It is an\r\noligoclase-trachyte impregnated with crystalline silica and exhibiting a\r\nsingular prismatic structure, the small columns or prisms being only 3\r\nor 4 inches in diameter. Between 400 and 500 feet occurs a\r\nlight-coloured compact rock sparkling with pyrites and also displaying a\r\ncolumnar structure, the columns being between 4 and 6 inches across. It\r\nlooks like a limestone and effervesces freely with an acid; but it is in\r\nfact a highly altered oligoclase-trachyte (sp. gr. 2·5) of the propylite\r\ntype. It seems originally to have inclosed a few phenocrysts of\r\noligoclase, sanidine, and pyroxene, and here and there a stout\r\nfelspar-lathe is to be noticed in the groundmass giving straight\r\nextinction. The whole texture of the rock, however, is more or less\r\nimpregnated with secondary quartz, calcite, chlorite, viridite, pyrites,\r\n&c. Farther up the ravine, between 500 and 600 feet in elevation, is\r\ndisplayed a remarkable quartz-porphyry which exhibits opaque porphyritic\r\ncrystals of felspar as well as rounded crystals of quartz in a grey\r\ncompact base. It has been subjected to considerable alteration and will\r\nbe found described on page 310.\r\n\r\nAt 600 feet large slabs of the ordinary sedimentary clay-tuffs,\r\ncontaining but little lime and showing no organic remains to the eye,\r\nlay about on the more level slopes, and evidently formed a surface\r\ndeposit incrusting the altered massive rocks. If my ascent had lain up\r\nthe mountain-side away from the stream-courses, these sedimentary rocks\r\nwould alone have been observed. In the gorge, however, is exposed to\r\nview the deeper-seated rocks that make up the mountain’s mass. We have\r\nhere a thickness of about 400 feet of altered acid rocks. All are\r\ndoubtless intrusive, and were subjected to alteration after the\r\ndevelopment of the columnar structure and before the deposition of the\r\noverlying clay-tuffs or “soapstones,” which are no doubt of submarine\r\norigin. These sedimentary tuffs belong probably to the period when the\r\nsubmarine agglomerates and palagonite-tuffs of the neighbouring peak of\r\nVungalei were formed.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Traverse of the coast range from Nandongo to Vanuavou on the\r\nshore of Natewa Bay._—This route was taken by Mr. Horne, the botanist,\r\nin 1878. I approached Nandongo from Tembe to the northward. The road at\r\nfirst lay between hills about 700 feet in height displaying in their\r\nprecipitous faces agglomerates overlying fine sedimentary tuffs. These\r\ndeposits in the form of slightly calcareous basic tuff-clays, the\r\nso-called “soapstones,” are exposed in the bed of the Wainikoro River as\r\none nears Nandongo. This village, which is situated on the headwaters of\r\nthe Wainikoro at an elevation of about 180 feet above the sea, lies near\r\nthe foot of the range. In its vicinity there is a small thermal spring\r\nwhich is referred to on page 33.\r\n\r\nProceeding south from Nandongo one notices in the stream-course at the\r\nfoot of the slopes the sedimentary tuff deposits above mentioned,\r\nbedding and dipping gently to the west. Farther up the slopes, higher\r\nthan 250 feet above the sea, there are exposed the deeper-seated rocks\r\nof the range in the shape of compact reddish rocks (sp. gr. 2·48), which\r\nappear under the microscope to be highly altered acid andesites or\r\noligoclase-trachytes originally displaying flow-structure and a fair\r\namount of glass, but now much disguised by the formation of secondary\r\nquartz. On this north slope of the range I also found an amygdaloidal\r\nvariety of the same altered rocks containing irregular amygdules, 5 or 6\r\nmillimetres long, of fibrous quartz or chalcedony. Blocks of basaltic\r\nandesite were observed on the summit, which has an elevation of 950 to\r\n1,000 feet. On the southern slopes descending towards Natewa Bay coarse\r\nbasic tuffs together with blocks of basaltic andesite are chiefly\r\nexposed. The last-named probably represent dykes both on the south slope\r\nand on the summit. The rocks exhibited on the portion of the coast of\r\nNatewa Bay corresponding to this range are dark and light-coloured\r\nsedimentary tuffs usually calcareous, with occasional basaltic andesites\r\nindicating dykes.... From this traverse it would appear that the range\r\nhas an axis of altered acid rocks overlain by basic sedimentary tuffs\r\nand pierced by basaltic dykes.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The mountainous district lying between the head waters of the\r\nWainikoro River and the Mount Thurston Range._—Of this region I know\r\nvery little. The highest peak according to the chart has an elevation of\r\nabout 1,600 feet. Some indication of the character of the inland rocks\r\nmay be obtained from that of those exposed on the coast between\r\nNakarambo and Waimotu where, as observed on page 208, grey\r\npyroxene-andesites, coarse in texture and almost holo-crystalline in\r\nstructure, protrude through agglomerates of the same materials. When on\r\nthe way from Ngelemumu to Wainikoro I crossed the extreme northern\r\nprolongation of this range where the elevation above the sea is only 700\r\nfeet. Non-calcareous basic tuff-clays occur on the slopes; but the\r\ndeeper-seated rocks, judging from an exposure on the east side, are dark\r\ngrey altered pyroxene-andesites penetrated by fine cracks filled with a\r\nmosaic of quartz and having a specific gravity of 2·7. On the summit I\r\nfound a gritty sandstone-like rock, of which my specimen has been lost.\r\nIn a stream at the foot of the east slope occur small blocks of basaltic\r\nandesite probably derived from a dyke. The region of acid rocks, such as\r\nquartz-porphyries, oligoclase-trachytes, &c., is not entered until about\r\ntwo miles south-west of Wainikoro.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE COAST RANGES AND SEA-BORDER BETWEEN MBUTHAI-SAU\r\n                       AND THAWARO OR MBEKANA BAY\r\n\r\nWe have in this region the mountains and hills at the coast and the\r\nlow-lying plains inland. This feature of the north side of Vanua Levu is\r\nvery remarkable. For some sixty miles, that is to say, for more than\r\nhalf the length of the island, between the mouth of the river Ndreketi\r\nand Thawaro or Mbekana Bay, Vanua Levu possesses this character. The\r\ncoast ranges west of Lambasa, where basic rocks evidently prevail, have\r\nbeen referred to on pages 135, 136. Those east of the Lambasa mountains\r\nas far as Thawaro Bay will be dealt with here; and instead of basic we\r\nfind acid rocks, such as quartz-porphyries akin to the rhyolites,\r\noligoclase-trachytes, pumice-tuffs, &c.\r\n\r\nThe sea-border is here characterised not by a continuous range running\r\nparallel to the coast, as in the case of the district between Nanduri\r\nand the Ndreketi River, but by a number of separate groups of hills and\r\nlesser mountains, separated by deep gaps or valleys which are occupied\r\nby tidal rivers and extensive mangrove swamps. The tide ascends these\r\nrivers into the plains behind the coast ranges, so that a depression of\r\nonly 30 feet would convert these groups of hills into separate islands\r\nand would cover much of the inland plains with the sea. The hills attain\r\nan elevation of 1,200 or 1,300 feet a mile or two inland and descend\r\noften as bold promontories to the coast. I will refer in order to the\r\ndifferent parts of this sea-border.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (1) THE SEA-BORDER BETWEEN LAMBASA AND MBUTHAI-SAU\r\n\r\nIn the sea-border between Lambasa and Mbuthai-sau we have the junction\r\nof the regions of basic and acid rocks, the former extending westward to\r\nNaivaka, the latter reaching to Undu Point. In such a locality the two\r\ntypes of rocks might be expected to be associated, and this is what\r\noccurs. Acid pumice-tuffs and basic agglomerates, sometimes associated,\r\nare here displayed. In the low hills between Lambasa and Vuni-ika Bay,\r\nwhich lies west of Mbuthai-sau, I found basic agglomerates prevailing,\r\ntogether with some acid pumice-tuffs. The blocks in the agglomerates are\r\ncomposed of a blackish semi-vitreous pyroxene-andesite (sp. gr. 2·68),\r\nwhich is characterised by prismatic pyroxene in the groundmass, and is\r\nreferred to genus 6 of the second sub-order of the hypersthene-augite\r\nandesites described on page 287.\r\n\r\nEast of Vuni-ika on the way to Mbuthai-sau, at an elevation of about 50\r\nfeet above the sea, dark tuffs containing small fragments of\r\nreef-limestone are exposed in a cutting. A little farther on there is a\r\nconsiderable deposit of a pale grey rhyolitic pumice-tuff, a soft stone\r\neasily worked, and indeed now quarried by the plantation authorities. It\r\ncontains no lime and in microscopical characters is scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from a sample of fine pumice debris collected by me in\r\nthe Chirica district of Lipari Island. It is made of fragments up to a\r\ncentimetre in size, of ordinary fibrillar pumice in a matrix of much\r\nfiner material of the same nature. Portions of crystals of glassy\r\nfelspar (oligoclase and sanidine) also occur in it, together with some\r\nquartz and rhombic pyroxene.\r\n\r\nThe association in this locality of acid and basic eruptive products was\r\nobserved by Dana in 1840 in the cliffs of “Mali Point.”[97] It is not\r\nquite clear whether Mali Island, which lies immediately adjacent to the\r\ncoast, is here alluded to, or whether it is a headland opposite to it.\r\nDana describes the deposits displayed in these cliffs as coarse\r\naggregates of fragments of pumice and decomposing trachyte, which pass\r\non the one side into fine clayey material, and on the other into an\r\nagglomerate formed of angular blocks of vesicular and compact basalt\r\nwith the interstices filled with pale yellow tufaceous material.\r\n\r\nEast of the Avuka Range that limits the Lambasa plains on this side is\r\nthe picturesque valley of Mbuthai-sau. This broad valley runs in a\r\nsouth-east direction into the heart of the island. So small is the\r\ngradient that the river flowing down it can be ascended in boats for\r\nsome miles; whilst Ngele-mumu, a village situated between 5 and 6 miles\r\nup the valley, is not much over 50 feet above the sea. This valley in\r\nits lower part roughly divides the regions of acid and basic rocks that\r\nlie east and west of it respectively. It has, however, been above\r\npointed out that the two regions overlap in the coast region on the west\r\nside of the valley. The two types of rocks are also associated in the\r\ncoast hills immediately east of the valley, since when striking inland\r\nfrom Lloyd Point to the Mbuthai-sau sugar-cane district, one leaves\r\nbehind the acid rocks at the coast and traverses a region of basic\r\nagglomerates. With these qualifications, therefore, the above line of\r\ndemarcation holds good.\r\n\r\n\r\n (2) THE SEA-BORDER BETWEEN THE MBUTHAI-SAU AND THE LANGA-LANGA RIVERS\r\n\r\nThe rocks predominating in this district are white and pale-yellow\r\npumice-tuffs and pumice agglomerates, with quartz-porphyries and\r\noligoclase-trachytes as intrusive masses. The light colour of the\r\nsea-cliffs, thus composed, makes them conspicuous from seaward. Their\r\nappearance evidently led Mr. Horne into an error in 1878 when he viewed\r\nthis coast from his canoe during his sea-passage from Lambasa to Tutu.\r\n“The coast from Lambasa”—he says—“is a series of bold projecting bluffs\r\nof agglomerate interspersed with seams of coralline sandstone.”[98] The\r\nprincipal feature of this coast, however, is the prevalence of\r\nlight-coloured pumice-tuffs, though it is not improbable that elevated\r\nreef-formations may occur in some localities.\r\n\r\nI particularly examined the coast districts in the vicinity of the\r\nWainikoro and Langa-Langa rivers. In a spur that descends to the right\r\nbank of the river, a little above the mouth of the Wainikoro, is exposed\r\nan open-textured rhyolite or quartz-porphyry containing, as described on\r\npage 310, phenocrysts of glassy felspar (oligoclase and sanidine),\r\nquartz, and a little hornblende. Some interesting exposures occur on the\r\ncoasts between Narikosa Point (Nari-Roso Point of the chart) and the\r\nmouth of the Wainikoro. Here the pumice-tuffs and agglomerates are\r\npierced by dykes, some of them vertical and 6 feet across and composed\r\nof a light-grey rhyolitic rock, similar except in its compact texture to\r\nthe rock above mentioned.[99] The small quartz crystals, which are 1 to\r\n2 millimetres in size, are sometimes bipyramidal. Many of them are\r\nrounded and have a fused-like surface. The pumice-tuff, which displays\r\nno effervescence with an acid, is composed mainly of finely pulverised\r\nvacuolar and fibrillar istropic colourless glass, and contains also\r\nsmall fragments of glassy felspar and small rounded quartz crystals,\r\nsuch as occur in the rock forming the dykes in these deposits. Imbedded\r\nin the tuffs in places are small masses, up to 4 inches in size, of a\r\npretty grey vesicular rhyolite-glass exhibiting the intermediate\r\ncondition between compact obsidian and pumice which is so characteristic\r\nof the rocks of Vulcano in the Lipari Islands. A more detailed account\r\nof this rock is given on page 311. In the pumice-agglomerates of this\r\nlocality occur pale-yellow decayed and altered pumice blocks.\r\n\r\nThe headland, known as Narikosa Point, which lies between the mouths of\r\nthe Wainikoro and Langa-langa rivers, terminates in a rocky spur formed\r\nby a large intrusive mass or dyke of a reddish oligoclase-trachyte\r\naltered in character and displaying in places a rudely columnar\r\nstructure.[100] The pumice-tuffs and agglomerates are well exposed at\r\nthe coast between Narikosa Point and the Langa-langa River. In the\r\nvicinity of Songombiau, a village here situated, the tuffs are\r\npenetrated by dykes. One dyke at the back of the village is 4 or 5 feet\r\nthick and has vitreous margins. It is composed of a darkish\r\npyroxene-andesite which in the interior of the intrusion in\r\nhemi-crystalline and a little vesicular, but in the margins it is more\r\nglassy and rather scoriaceous.[101] Though not a basic rock in itself,\r\nits specific gravity in the compact state being only about 2·55, it is\r\nrelatively basic when contrasted with the rhyolitic and trachytic rocks\r\nof the district, which have when compact a specific gravity of not over\r\n2·3.\r\n\r\nPumice-tuffs and agglomerates appear in the cliff-faces of the hills on\r\neither side of the lower course of the Langa-langa River from the\r\nvicinity of Kalikoso to the sea. At one place about 3 miles up the river\r\na dyke of trachyte, much altered and showing columns 12 to 18 inches\r\nacross, was exposed at the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n      (3) SEA-BORDER BETWEEN THE LANGA-LANGA RIVER AND THAWARO BAY\r\n\r\nThe next part of the coast which I visited was that opposite Tutu\r\nIsland. Here a range of high hills, 1,100 or 1,200 feet in height, sends\r\na lofty spur to the sea, in the precipitous faces of which are exposed\r\nbreccia-tuffs and agglomerates derived from acid rocks. A specimen of\r\nthe tuffs shows, besides fragments of altered rhyolitic or trachytic\r\nrocks, portions of decomposing pumice, the vacuoles and tubular cavities\r\nof which are filled with alteration products. The blocks in the\r\nagglomerates are altered oligoclase-trachytes, both compact and\r\nvesicular. These deposits are non-calcareous and rarely display bedding;\r\nbut in one place there was a rude arrangement of the materials, the dip\r\nbeing to the north-west. I crossed this coast range where it is only 600\r\nfeet above the sea, and descended into the Kalikoso plains in the\r\nvicinity of Numbu.\r\n\r\nIn the coast district between Tutu Island and the village of Naua, 3½\r\nmiles to the east, the same altered coarse pumiceous and trachytic\r\ntuffs, occasionally bedded and dipping W.N.W., form the low hills near\r\nthe sea. In one place, where the elevation was less than 200 feet, I\r\nnoticed on the surface small fragments of branching corals. They had\r\nperhaps weathered out of the tuffs, and though in part silicified still\r\neffervesced freely in an acid.\r\n\r\nBetween Naua and the town of Visongo occur low hills formed of acid\r\ntuffs. At an elevation of 200 feet the tuffs display a remarkable\r\ncharacter. When examined with the lens they are seen to be crowded with\r\nthe minute tests of foraminifera of the “Globigerina” type. The deposit\r\nforms a fairly hard light-grey clay-rock which according to the usual\r\nacid-test has no lime. Under the microscope it is seen to be composed\r\nnearly in equal proportion of the tests of foraminifera and of very fine\r\ndetritus apparently derived from acid rocks, the materials being\r\ngenerally not over ·01 mm. in diameter, though some of the felspar\r\nfragments measure ·05 mm. across. A secondary process of silicification,\r\nas exhibited in the occurrence of minutely granular quartz, has affected\r\nthe matrix of the clay as well as the tests of the foraminifera. The\r\ndeposit is of deep-water origin and appears to have been formed from the\r\nfine washings of a coast some distance away.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the surface in this locality is in places strewn\r\nwith quantities of angular fragments and round pebbles of chalcedonic\r\nflint, together with large nodules which when broken across are found to\r\nbe occupied by radiating crystals of quartz and were doubtless formed in\r\nthe cavities of some rock. Reference has already been made to the\r\npartially silicified coral fragments lying on the surface of the low\r\ncoast hills a few miles to the west of this locality. They indicate a\r\nrelatively recent emergence and we get the same indication from the\r\nflints on the surface of this district. These evidences, however, relate\r\nonly to the last stage of the emergence. The testimony of the silicified\r\n“Globigerina” clay carries us back to the earlier periods of these\r\nchanges of level, and probably dates back to a time when the greater\r\npart of this portion of the island was submerged, with the exception of\r\nthe mountain peaks. Not the least interesting feature of the emergence\r\nis the silicifying process that accompanied it. This is illustrated on a\r\nmuch greater scale in the neighbouring inland plains of Kalikoso and\r\nWainikoro which are described in Chapter XXV.\r\n\r\nProceeding eastward from Visongo to Namukalau one traverses a coast\r\ndistrict not elevated more than 300 feet above the sea. Here there are\r\ndisplayed whitish and pale yellow compacted tuffs differing in aspect\r\nfrom those prevailing to the westward and often bedded, the dip being\r\nabout 20° N.W. or N.N.W. They show no lime and apparently inclose no\r\norganic remains. Where the upper surface of a bed is bared, it shows\r\nregular shrinkage-lines inclosing hexagonal spaces 2 to 3 inches across;\r\nbut there is no corresponding columnar structure in the bed-mass. The\r\nrock is very light in weight and homogeneous in texture and looks a\r\nlittle like China-clay. In a section its structure appears obscure; but\r\nit seems to be formed of the finest detritus, derived from some acid\r\npartly devitrified glass, the pumiceous structure being in places\r\nfaintly indicated; but the whole mass appears to have been subjected to\r\na process of alteration perhaps similar to the ultimate palagonitic\r\nchange in basic rocks. In the slide a few small felspar fragments, about\r\n·1 mm. in size, are displayed.\r\n\r\nJust east of Namukalau is the mouth of the Vui-na-savu River, the Na\r\nSavu River of the chart. This is a tidal river, and is navigable for\r\nboats for several miles. In the lower part of its course agglomerates\r\nand tuffs prevail, probably in part at least derived from acid rocks.\r\nNear Rauriko, which lies about 5 miles up the river, a bare bluff,\r\noverlooking the valley on the east, is formed of a decomposed trachytic\r\nrock remarkable for the fact that it displays, as described on page 370,\r\nfaint magnetic polarity. Above Vitina, a mile or two farther up, I found\r\na similar rock but amygdaloidal in character. On the head-waters of the\r\nriver is situated the hamlet of Nawi, where, as mentioned on page 211, a\r\nplutonic rock of the gabbro type occurs. Tuffs and agglomerates appear\r\nto prevail in the low coast tract between the Vui-na-Savu river and\r\nThawaro Bay.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn drawing some general inferences respecting the acid formations,\r\nmostly fragmental in character, that are displayed in the sea-border\r\nbetween Lambasa and Thawaro Bay, it is necessary to distinguish between\r\nthe deposits west and east of the Langa-langa River. Between Lambasa and\r\nthe river just named the tuffs may usually be regarded as the products\r\nof sub-aerial eruptions. Some of the specimens might have been obtained,\r\nas far as their characters go, from the pumice-districts in the island\r\nof Lipari. Their limeless condition and the apparent absence of organic\r\nremains are noteworthy features, though of course the products of\r\nsub-aerial eruptions may be deposited under the sea. It is, however,\r\nremarkable that no compact obsidian came under my notice. The fragments\r\nof rhyolitic glass, intermediate in structure between compact obsidian\r\nand pumice, that were imbedded in the pumice-tuffs in one locality, were\r\nprobably ejected from some sub-aerial vent.\r\n\r\nIn the region between the Langa-langa River and Thawaro Bay acid tuffs\r\nand agglomerates prevail; but they have all been subjected to alteration\r\nby the deposition of secondary silica, and the pumice-structure when\r\npresent is largely disguised. They have evidently, in part at least,\r\nbeen derived from compact rhyolitic and trachytic rocks, and are\r\nprobably in some measure the products of marine erosion. Although\r\nneither lime nor organic remains were detected, the presence of the\r\naltered “Globigerina” clay near Visongo is very suggestive and indicates\r\na considerable submergence of this region at some distant period.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, remains to be done in the examination of the peaks of the\r\ncoast ranges of this part of Vanua Levu; and it is likely that some\r\ninteresting results will be obtained from such an exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n           THE NORTH-EAST PORTION OF THE ISLAND (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE WAINIKORO AND KALIKOSO PLAINS\r\n\r\nTHESE extensive inland plains occupy a considerable area in this part of\r\nthe island. I estimate that there is an area of about 20 square miles\r\nthat does not exceed an elevation of 100 feet above the sea and is often\r\nmuch less. Of the two villages situated in the midst of these plains,\r\nabout 5 miles inland, Kalikoso is about 30 feet and Wainikoro is\r\nscarcely 20 feet above the sea; whilst much of the surrounding district\r\nis similarly low. Taking the 300-feet contour-line as a guide, this\r\nlow-lying region, as shown in the map, would be much larger. The plains\r\nare backed on the south by the high mountain-range of Vungalei and\r\nNailotha. On the north the coast-ranges, which attain a height of 1,100\r\nor 1,200 feet, separate them from the sea-border; whilst on the west\r\nthey are shut off from the Mbuthai-sau valley by a line of hills, of\r\nwhich the minimum elevation is about 700 feet. This region is occupied\r\nby the scanty open vegetation characteristic of the “talasinga” or\r\n“sun-burnt” districts. The tall “Ngasau” reed is common; the Pandanus\r\ntrees are frequent; and amongst the bushes and small trees are\r\nrepresented “Dodonæa viscosa,” “Morinda citrifolia,” and a species of\r\n“Hibbertia.”\r\n\r\nDifferent rivers and streams, rising in the mountains on the south side\r\nof the plains, traverse this area; and after breaking through the\r\ncoast-ranges reach the sea. They acquire an exaggerated size from the\r\ncircumstance that they are in great part tidal estuaries. The tide\r\nascends them for several miles reaching behind the coast-ranges into the\r\nplains; whilst the dense mangroves, which line their lower courses\r\namongst the hills, extend beyond into the low-lying level districts\r\nfarther inland. Boats can follow up the winding course of the Wainikoro\r\nRiver until they reach the village of that name, which lies about five\r\nand a half miles in a direct line from the coast and nearly in the\r\ncentre of this part of the island. The mangroves extend up to the\r\nvillage. The Langa-langa River, which is of much smaller size, is\r\nsimilarly navigable for three or four miles. The mangroves that line its\r\nbanks spread out in broad tracts when in ascending the river we emerge\r\nfrom the hills into the plains. Above the influence of the tide it\r\ndwindles into a stream ridiculously small. The same remarks apply to the\r\nriver two miles to the eastward. The Vui-na-savu River near the eastern\r\nmargin of this low-lying region can be ascended by boats into the heart\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing remarks it will be expected that some portion of this\r\nlow-lying inland region will be occupied by swamps. This is in truth the\r\ncase. About one and a half miles north-east from the village of Kalikoso\r\nis a small fresh-water lake, about 100 yards across, which lies in a\r\nslight depression in the plains and is surrounded by a wide margin of\r\nswampy ground, occupied by reeds and sedges, in which one sinks\r\nknee-deep when approaching the banks. The level of the surface of the\r\nlake is not over 25 feet above the sea, and only a foot or so below that\r\nof the plains around. Since the depth, as I ascertained it, is 15 to 18\r\nfeet, it follows that the bottom of the lake is only a few feet above\r\nthe high-tide level. The mangroves extend to within a mile of its\r\nborder; and it is possible that though lying about five miles inland, it\r\nmay be indirectly affected by unusually high tides. It would be\r\ninteresting to determine whether the water is ever brackish.\r\n\r\nThis small lake is, or was, regarded with superstitious awe by the\r\nnatives on account of the floating islands that it contains. Different\r\nlegends are connected with it, and the Fijians have given it the name of\r\n“Vaka-lalatha,” in allusion to the drifting of the islands from one side\r\nof the lake to the other, the small trees growing upon them acting “in\r\nthe manner of sails.” Mr. Horne, who was in this locality in 1878,\r\nrefers to the lake in his book, _A Year in Fiji_ (p. 24); but does not\r\nappear to have seen it. Mr. Thomson[102] visited it in 1880, and\r\ndescribes it as containing a single floating island, a quarter to a half\r\nan acre in extent. The island was in existence, the natives said, in the\r\ndays of their great-grandfathers, a statement indicating that the people\r\nof the district had no reason to doubt its antiquity. A chief, who\r\nformed one of the party, dived under the island.\r\n\r\nWhen I visited this lake in 1899 there were three floating islands,\r\nnamed by the natives “Wanga levu” and “Wanga lailai,” that is, “Large\r\ncanoe” and “Small canoe.” The largest was 90 or 100 feet long, whilst\r\nthe two smaller were about 50 feet long, the breadth being less than\r\nhalf the length. They are composed of a dense growth of reeds and sedges\r\nsupporting small living trees 10 to 17 feet in height, swamp ferns, and\r\nother smaller vegetation, the whole forming fairly solid\r\nstanding-ground, and doubtless possessing considerable thickness.\r\n\r\nThe origin of these floating islands is probably to be found in the\r\ncircumstance that the dense mass of swamp-vegetation lies on a rocky\r\nsubstratum, and that during some unusually heavy flood large portions of\r\nthe swampy soil-cap became detached and floated up. A floating island\r\noccurs near the sea in the Lauthala district on the Lower Rewa in Viti\r\nLevu. The floating island in Derwentwater in the north of England is\r\nsaid to be “a blister of sublacustrine turf.” Those in Russia and\r\nHungary, according to Mr. Hanusz, appear to be felted masses of\r\ntree-trunks, branches, and marsh-plants thinly covered with soil.[103]\r\n\r\nI will preface my remarks on the geology of the Wainikoro and Kalikoso\r\nplains by observing that this region displays three conspicuous\r\nfeatures. In the first place, it is a region of acid rocks, mostly\r\naltered tuffs, derived from quartz-porphyries, the alteration consisting\r\nin the deposition of quartz often of the chalcedonic type. In the second\r\nplace, a silicifying process has been in operation here on an extensive\r\nscale, as evidenced by the abundance of silicified corals lying on the\r\nsurface, especially in the district around the lake and by the abundance\r\nof concretions of chalcedony, of fragments of chalcedonic flints, and of\r\nportions of white chalcedonic quartz-rock that in places strew the\r\nground. In the third place, earthy limonite, or bog iron ore, has been\r\nproduced in quantity, particularly around the lake; and in places small\r\nround concretions of impure carbonate of iron cover the soil. Before\r\nreferring more in detail to the different parts of this region, it may\r\nbe remarked that the silicified corals, flints, iron-ore deposits, &c.,\r\nof this and other parts of the island are dealt with in Chapter XXV.\r\n\r\nThis region of acid rocks extends about two miles to the west and\r\nsouth-west of the village of Wainikoro. Here prevail white acid tuffs\r\noften decomposing and altered by the formation of secondary quartz. They\r\nare derived from the degradation of quartz-porphyries or rhyolitic\r\nrocks. The surface is irregular but the elevation is small, the 100-feet\r\nlevel lying about one mile and the 200-feet level about two miles west\r\nof Wainikoro.\r\n\r\nThe villages of Wainikoro and Kalikoso are from two to three miles\r\napart, the intervening district not attaining a greater elevation than\r\n70 feet above the sea. Decomposing altered white acid tuffs here occur\r\nwith occasional large blocks, a couple of tons in weight, of apparently\r\na quartz-porphyry or trachyte with its structure disguised by\r\nsilicification. Fragments of siliceous concretions, as chalcedony,\r\nchalcedonic flints, &c., lie on the surface, the soil being friable and\r\nof a deep ochreous red; whilst in places the ground is covered with\r\nround marble-sized concretions composed of a mixture of carbonate of\r\niron and limonite which I have described on page 356. A few hundred\r\nyards to the north-west of Kalikoso, where there is a little rise, a\r\ndecomposed quartz-porphyry is exposed displaying rounded crystals of\r\nquartz fractured in position, the matrix of the rock being impregnated\r\nwith chalcedony. In one part of this mound there is a friable white\r\nrock, composed of a crumbling mass of small irregular quartz-grains,\r\nrarely showing crystal-faces. It appears to be disintegrated\r\nquartz-felsite.\r\n\r\nIn taking the track from Kalikoso to the village of Vungalei, which is\r\ndistant about 2½ miles to the south-east, one traverses after the first\r\nmile, where the acid rocks terminate, a rather more elevated region\r\nwhich rises to a maximum height of 180 feet above the sea. Though the\r\nacid rocks give place to a semi-vitreous pyroxene-andesite as described\r\non page 212, small fragments of chalcedonic flints are frequent on the\r\nsurface over both areas. The district that intervenes between Kalikoso\r\nand the landing-place on the Langa-langa River, about two miles in\r\nlength, is not more than 30 feet above the sea, and is crossed by small\r\nsluggish streams, in the beds of which occur numerous fragments of\r\nsilicified corals, up to 3 or 4 inches in size, belonging to the Porites\r\nand Astræan type. In these stream-beds also occur bits of mamillated\r\nchalcedony and of onyx, flattish agates, 3 or 4 inches across, and\r\npebbles of the compact pyroxene-andesite above alluded to, the last\r\nprobably derived from the south side of the plains.\r\n\r\nThe plains extend in a north-east direction as far as Numbu, which lies\r\nbetween 2½ and 3 miles north-east of Kalikoso. The country between these\r\ntwo places is usually elevated between 60 and 100 feet and is never more\r\nthan 130 feet above the sea. It is known as the Kuru-kuru district. The\r\nsurface is strewn with the fragments of flints and of a white\r\nchalcedonic quartz-rock; whilst the soil is friable and deep-red in\r\ncolour, limonite in abundant fragments occurring on the ground. Here and\r\nthere one passes slabs of a hard white silicified tuff, small portions\r\nof which are frequent on the surface.\r\n\r\nSilicified corals and earthy limonite are to be found in abundance\r\nscattered over the surface of the plains immediately surrounding the\r\nsmall lake of Vakalalatha. We also find lying on the ground in this\r\ndistrict bits of chalcedony and onyx, portions of chalcedonic flints,\r\nand nodules of the size of the fist, which when fractured either\r\ndisclose the regular layers of the agate or radiating crystals of\r\nquartz. The silicified corals occur usually in fragments not over 4\r\ninches across, and include portions of branching corals of the Madrepore\r\nhabit, bits of massive corals of the Astræan type, small rounded nobs of\r\n“Porites” just as one commonly observes on a reef-flat, &c. They have an\r\nancient weathered look, and in some cases it is evident from the\r\nexistence of boring-shells in the fractured end of a branching coral\r\nthat it once lay as a dead fragment on the surface of a reef-flat.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XXV. the characters of the silicified corals of the island\r\nare discussed in detail; and I have there advanced the view that the\r\nextensive silicification of the Kalikoso and Wainikoro plains took place\r\nduring the consolidation of the calcareous muds of a reef-flat whilst\r\nthe land was emerging. I have already alluded on page 222 to an area of\r\nsilicification on the neighbouring sea-border between Visongo and Tutu.\r\nThere can be no doubt that during the last stage of the emergence the\r\npresent situation of the fresh-water lake near Kalikoso was occupied by\r\nthe sea, which also extended far over the surrounding plains. The\r\nprocess of silicification would of necessity be restricted to the period\r\nthat has since elapsed; and the discussion is therefore confined to the\r\nnature of the conditions under which this change was induced. As a\r\nfactor in the process we cannot disregard the acid character of the\r\nrocks of the district.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE UNDU PROMONTORY\r\n\r\nThe north-east portion of the island terminates in a long narrow\r\npromontory which I have named after Undu Point at its extremity.\r\nCommencing at Thawaro Bay and near Tawaki it runs in a straight line for\r\na distance of between 13 and 14 miles, its breadth varying between 1½\r\nand 2½ miles. Its greatest elevation of nearly 1,600 feet is attained at\r\nits western end; and it diminishes irregularly in height as one proceeds\r\ntowards Undu Point, where a height of 400 feet is maintained about a\r\nmile from the cape. It is bordered by reefs sometimes a mile in breadth,\r\nand the reefs prolong the promontory for another three miles beyond Undu\r\nPoint. As indicated by the 100-fathom line, the submarine contour\r\ncorresponds to that of the land, and the extent of marine erosion during\r\nthe existing relations of land and sea is evidently displayed in the\r\nbreadth of the reefs. I found no sign of upraised reefs; and although\r\ndiligent inquiries were made nothing could be learned of any hot\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the following remarks that pumice-tuffs,\r\nquartz-porphyries, and oligoclase-trachytes, are the prevailing rocks.\r\nOn the north side they may be regarded as continuous with the acid rocks\r\nof the region extending from near Lambasa to Thawaro Bay. On the south\r\nside they commence in the vicinity of Tawaki.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1) THE DISTRICT EXTENDING TWO AND A HALF MILES WEST OF TAWAKI\r\n\r\nWhen proceeding eastward along the north coast of Natewa Bay one enters\r\nthe region of acid rocks between 2 and 2½ miles west of Tawaki. Here the\r\ncountry is much broken, picturesque hills with bare precipitous faces\r\nrising up near the coast, one of which named Natoto has a rudely conical\r\nand truncated form. Grey oligoclase-trachytes having a specific gravity\r\nof 2·4 and possessing the characters described on page 308, prevail in\r\nthe district extending west of Tawaki. Sometimes they occur in mass; but\r\nthey often form agglomerates. A singular pitchstone-agglomerate occurs\r\nat the coast at the foot of Natoto. The pitchstone, which has a specific\r\ngravity of 2·48, is a semi-vitreous form of a hypersthene-augite\r\nandesite. It shows abundant small pyroxene prisms in its glassy\r\ngroundmass and is referred to the prismatic sub-order (5) described on\r\npage 289.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       (2) NAITHOMBOTHOMBO RANGE\r\n\r\nA high range of hills, forming the backbone of this part of the island,\r\nextends eastward for about five miles from Thawaro and Tawaki. It is\r\nnamed “Naithombothombo” in the Admiralty chart. From it rise two\r\nconspicuous peaks, Thawaro Peak (1,573 feet) at its western end, where\r\nit overlooks the village of that name, and Mount Thuku (1,288 feet) near\r\nits eastern end. West of Thawaro Peak this range is connected with the\r\nhills beyond by a saddle 600 feet in height, which is ascended when\r\ncrossing the promontory from Thawaro Bay to Tawaki.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Thawaro Peak._—This represents an old “volcanic neck” of\r\nagglomerate rising out of the tuffs that are exposed on its slopes to an\r\nelevation of about 600 feet. As viewed from the saddle above mentioned,\r\nthe upper part of the hill presents bare precipitous sides, several\r\nhundred feet in height, of agglomerate, the blocks of which are composed\r\nof a compact hypersthene-augite andesite (sp. gr. 2·48). It displays a\r\nfew small phenocrysts of medium andesine and of rhombic and monoclinic\r\npyroxene; and is referred to the prismatic sub-order (5) described on\r\npage 289, characterised by prismatic pyroxene in the groundmass.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _South coast between Tawaki and the foot of Mount Thuku._—The tall\r\ncliffs that rise to a height of from 200 to 300 feet behind Tawaki are\r\ncomposed of white tuffs and agglomerate-tuffs derived from the acid\r\nrocks of the district. Eastward from Tawaki to the base of Mount Thuku\r\nthe coast scenery is particularly fine. A little inland a line of hills,\r\nnamed “Na Kula,” rises precipitously to a height of 700 or 800 feet, and\r\nin the vertical sides are displayed tuffs and agglomerates probably of\r\nthe character of those above noticed. Light-coloured tuffs are sometimes\r\nexposed at the coast in which are inclosed fragments varying in size of\r\na pitchstone[104] (sp. gr. 2·36) approaching in structure a trachytic\r\nglass. At one place the tuffs were evidently sedimentary and bedded, the\r\ndip being about 15° N.W.\r\n\r\nThe massive rock most frequently exposed at the coast and on the\r\nhill-slopes between Tawaki and Mount Thuku is a quartz porphyry[105]\r\ndisplaying abundant porphyritic crystals of quartz and felspar in a\r\ngroundmass originally semi-vitreous but now obscurely felsitic in\r\ncharacter. The shore-flat for more than half a mile west of Mount Thuku\r\nis strewn with great numbers of detached columnar blocks, 12 to 15\r\ninches across, of a slightly vesicular oligoclase-trachyte of the type\r\ndescribed on page 308.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _North coast between Thawaro Bay and the foot of Mount\r\nThuku._—Coarse and fine tuffs prevail at the coast and on the\r\nneighbouring hill-slopes; and in the bare rocky faces of the hills\r\ninland they are also to be observed. The streams have worn deep gorges\r\ninto their mass. Towards Thuku they are acid and pumiceous, and are\r\nevidently the products of eruption. Towards Thawaro, they are more basic\r\nand darker, and are in part at least to be attributed to marine\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Mount Thuku._—My ascent of this hill, which is 1,288 feet in\r\nheight, was made from the north coast. I found it to be composed from\r\nthe foot to the summit of white pumiceous tuffs without any evident\r\narrangement. It has a narrow top and shows no sign of a crateral\r\ncavity. The hills east and west, as viewed from its summit, are\r\nridge-shaped and display nothing in their configuration at all\r\nsuggestive of craters. The pumice-tuffs of Mount Thuku are\r\nnon-calcareous, and exhibit greyish pumiceous lapilli in an abundant\r\nwhite matrix formed of fine pumice-debris. Under the microscope it\r\nshows the characteristic vacuolar and fibrillar structure; but the\r\nmaterial has not the fresh appearance of ordinary pumice and the\r\nminute cavities are often filled with alteration products. The two\r\nrocky points on the north coast opposite the hill are formed in one\r\ncase of a somewhat altered oligoclase-trachyte and in the other of a\r\nquartz-porphyry. Both no doubt represent intrusive masses, the almost\r\nhorizontal columns, 12 to 15 inches in diameter, of the former\r\nindicating a nearly vertical dyke.\r\n\r\n\r\n              (3) THE UNDU PROMONTORY EAST OF MOUNT THUKU\r\n\r\nEast of Mount Thuku the hilly backbone of the promontory is of much less\r\nelevation. About three miles to the eastward the highest hill is 630\r\nfeet, and thence to within a mile or two of Undu Point the hills retain\r\na height of 400 to 500 feet.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The north coast between Mount Thuku and the coast village of\r\nNuku-ndamu._—On this stretch of coast, about five miles in length, the\r\nshore-cliffs are composed of white and pale-yellow, coarse and fine\r\nstratified pumice-tuffs, the beds being either horizontal or with a\r\ngentle dip northward. They are as a rule non-calcareous, and contain\r\nsome quartz grains and small bits, 1 to 3 millimetres in size, of bottle\r\ngreen compact obsidian, much as one finds in Lipari pumice-tuffs. In\r\ngeneral character, both naked-eye and microscopic, they correspond to\r\nthe Mount Thuku pumice-tuffs above described. Large blocks of basic\r\nrocks are occasionally to be observed on this coast, sometimes probably\r\nindicating dykes, but in one place near Mount Thuku forming an\r\nagglomerate. The rock is a dark-grey augite-andesite with a specific\r\ngravity of 2·77. It is compact and has a hemi-crystalline\r\ngroundmass.[106]\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The south coast between Mount Thuku and Moala, a distance of\r\nabout five miles._—Pumice-tuffs and agglomerates are displayed at the\r\ncoast, the former often bedded and in one place having a dip of 35 or 40\r\ndegrees to the north. A quartz-porphyry, somewhat banded and a little\r\naltered, and displaying rounded quartz crystals 3 or 4 millimetres in\r\nsize, is the prevailing massive rock exposed on the hill-slopes and\r\noccasionally at the coast. It is well exhibited about a mile east of\r\nMount Thuku. Blocks of a grey oligoclase-trachyte also occur. These\r\nrocks are described on pages 308, 309.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The terminal portion of the promontory from Nuku-ndamu and Moala\r\nto Undu Point._—The same pumiceous tuffs, usually non-calcareous, form\r\nthe shore-cliffs on the south coast from Moala to Mr. Bulling’s station\r\nat Ndothiu, which lies about 2 miles from the point. On the\r\ncorresponding part of the north coast between Nuku-ndamu and Ndothiu\r\nthese tuffs are often calcareous; and near the first-named place they\r\ncontain sub-angular bits of coral of the size of a walnut. On the beach\r\nat Vunikondi in this locality they are overlain by nearly horizontal\r\nbeds of basic lava, the upper surface of which when exposed displays the\r\nsmooth, “ropy” crust of a lava flow. The rock is a dark slightly\r\nvesicular augite-andesite, hemi-crystalline in structure, and containing\r\na fair amount of residual glass.[107] Since the underlying tuffs were\r\nevidently deposited on a sea-bottom, it follows that this is a submarine\r\nflow. I intended to revisit this locality, but was prevented. A detailed\r\nexamination of it would be worth undertaking.\r\n\r\nFrom Ndothiu to Undu Point, about 2 miles distant, the interior of the\r\npromontory has an undulating surface, the elevation being usually 200 or\r\n300 feet and rising to 400 feet. On the coasts are exposed bedded\r\npumiceous tuffs, steeply inclined and usually calcareous. As displayed\r\nin the hill-slopes of the interior they are horizontally stratified and\r\nas a rule non-calcareous. These deposits sometimes exhibit a spheroidal\r\narrangement indicative of the proximity of a dyke. In one or two places\r\nat the coasts occur basic agglomerates, formed of the same\r\naugite-andesite lava-rock of which the Vunikondi beds are composed, but\r\nscoriaceous and containing more glass in the groundmass. In the\r\nhand-specimen beside me, the steam cavities are of all sizes, from that\r\nof a pin-prick to a third of an inch (8 mm.) and are generally\r\nelongated.\r\n\r\nA careful search of the tuff-deposits in this part of the Undu\r\npromontory ought to result in the discovery of remains, both of plants\r\nand of marine mollusks. Mr. Chalmers informed me that fossilised\r\ntree-trunks occur on the coast near Vunikondi; but I was unfortunately\r\nnot able to discover them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL CHARACTERS OF THE UNDU PROMONTORY FROM\r\nTHAWARO AND TAWAKI TO UNDU POINT.—One suggestive negative feature of\r\nthis region is to be found in the absence, as far as I could ascertain,\r\nof any trace of a crater. Here also, as in the area of acid rocks\r\nextending westward along the north side of the island to near Lambasa,\r\nhot springs are not to be found. The prevailing rocks are in the first\r\nplace the pumice-tuffs, which not only as a rule form the coast-cliffs,\r\nbut occur inland as high as the summit of Mount Thuku almost 1,300 feet\r\nabove the sea. They were probably in great part ejected from sub-aërial\r\nvents, though no doubt, as in the vicinity of Undu Point, they were\r\noften deposited under the sea. The acid and basic tuffs in the vicinity\r\nof Tawaki and Thawaro are, as I imagine, largely derived from marine\r\ndegradation. Next to the pumice-tuffs, massive quartz-porphyries and\r\noligoclase-trachytes are the characteristic rocks. They are probably in\r\nmost cases intrusive, and present themselves sometimes as vertical\r\ncolumnar dykes, evidently of considerable dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe basic rocks, however, are not unrepresented. They occur in one or\r\ntwo places as agglomerates, as in the vicinity of Mount Thuku on the\r\nnorth coast and near Undu Point; whilst they form “flows” overlying the\r\npumiceous tuffs at Vunikondi. Occasional blocks lying on the surface on\r\nthe north coast are indications of dykes. The basic rocks, nevertheless,\r\ntake a very secondary part in the composition of the Undu Promontory.\r\nThey are in most cases to be referred to the augite-andesites with a\r\nspecific gravity 2·6 to 2·77; but some, as in the case of those forming\r\nthe agglomerates of Thawaro Peak, are hypersthene-augite andesites with\r\nspecific gravity of about 2·5. Olivine-basalts are not represented.\r\n\r\nThe vents, from which the materials forming this promontory were\r\nejected, were arranged in a single straight line for a length of 14\r\nmiles. Along this linear fissure, which was probably submarine, vents\r\nwere at different times formed; and though owing to sub-aerial and\r\nmarine degradation the present surface has been since shaped and\r\nreshaped, their situation may still be recognised in the “necks” of tuff\r\nand agglomerate that form the peaks, and in the large dykes or sills of\r\nquartz-porphyry and oligoclase-trachyte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                    THE VOLCANIC ROCKS OF VANUA LEVU\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE varied character of the volcanic rocks in my collection is brought\r\nout in the following Table, where I have grouped about 400\r\nrock-sections, excluding those of the tuffs and finer detrital deposits.\r\nThe small proportion of plutonic rocks should be noted.\r\n\r\n Olivine-basalts                             23 per cent.\r\n Augite-andesites                            40  \"   \"\r\n Hypersthene-augite-andesites                17  \"   \"\r\n Acid andesites, including hornblende\r\n    and quartz-andesites, &c.                12  \"   \"\r\n Oligoclase-trachytes, quartz-porphyries\r\n    or rhyolites                              6  \"   \"\r\n Hypersthene-gabbros and diorites             2  \"   \"\r\n                                           ----\r\n                                            100\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the necessity of frequently describing rocks of the\r\nsame type it has been found requisite to devise a method of\r\nclassification. In carrying out this somewhat laborious task I have\r\noften been surprised at the readiness with which rocks, the relations of\r\nwhich had been previously very difficult to ascertain, fell into their\r\nplace in the scheme. Although many of my uncertainties have been thus\r\nremoved, a large number of doubtful points remain. I venture to think,\r\nhowever, that others may be able to employ and also to extend the method\r\nof classification here employed.\r\n\r\nThe general plan followed has been worked out in detail for the\r\nolivine-basalts and the pyroxene-andesites of the more basic type;\r\nwhilst lack of materials has prevented its further elaboration in the\r\ncase of the acid andesites, oligoclase-trachytes, quartz-porphyries, &c.\r\nThe treatment of all the classes has been uniform, the scheme being the\r\nsame whether applied to a basalt or to a dacite.\r\n\r\nIn describing the general method I will take the Augite class. As will\r\nbe seen in the Synopsis that follows, this class is first divided\r\naccording to the absence or presence of a groundmass into two\r\nsub-classes, the first referring to the plutonic rocks, which, however,\r\nare not represented in my collection, the second comprising the\r\naugite-andesites which make up 40 per cent. of the total. These\r\nandesites are again divided into four orders, according as the\r\ngroundmass presents parallel or non-parallel felspar-lathes, or short\r\nand stout felspars (orthophyric), or displays a felsitic character. The\r\nlast two orders are practically unrepresented here, though many examples\r\nof them are found amongst the more acid andesites. Each order is then\r\nsplit up into three sub-orders depending on the nature of the pyroxene\r\nof the groundmass, whether granular, prismatic, or ophitic.\r\n\r\nEach sub-order is broken up into two sections, one displaying\r\nplagioclase-phenocrysts, the other without them, or possessing very few\r\nof them. The first section is divided into two genera, according to the\r\ncharacter of the plagioclase-phenocrysts, whether glassy or opaque, the\r\nsecond genus often comprising rocks allied to the porphyrites. The\r\nsecond or aphanitic section is subdivided into two genera according to\r\nthe character of the pyroxene-phenocrysts; in the one case they are\r\nmacroporphyritic; in the other they are either small or absent. The\r\ngenera are split into four species according to the length of the\r\nfelspar-lathes, a method which readily separates out the doleritic\r\nrocks. In cases where the materials are abundant, the genera have been\r\nfirst divided into porphyritic and non-porphyritic sub-genera, based on\r\nthe macroporphyritic or the micro-porphyritic character of the\r\nplagioclase-phenocrysts, when present. The species can be also split\r\ninto sub-species, according to the degree of basicity of the rocks, as\r\nindicated by the specific gravity.\r\n\r\nThis method is fully worked out in the later pages and need not be\r\nfurther described here. With abundant material from different regions it\r\nappears to me that a ready mode is here afforded of assigning to a rock\r\nits place in the scheme. In this way it would be possible to follow the\r\nsystematist in his method of comparing plants and animals from different\r\nlocalities. To facilitate this end, I have suggested in the synopsis the\r\nemployment of abbreviations, so that the description of the critical\r\ncharacters of a rock can be condensed into a formula capable of easy\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the use of these abbreviations I will take the instance\r\nof a common form of augite-andesite which is represented by the\r\nformula:—“_Plag, aug, matr, flu, gran, non-phen, parv, ·1-·2 mm._” This\r\nis the formula for an aphanitic augite-andesite, and it signifies that\r\nit is a rock of the plagioclase-augite class possessing a groundmass\r\nshowing parallel felspar-lathes (between ·1 and ·2 mm, in average\r\nlength) and granular pyroxene, and displaying no phenocrysts of\r\nplagioclase or only a very few of small size, whilst pyroxene\r\nphenocrysts if present are micro-porphyritic.\r\n\r\nAs another example the following formula for a type of porphyrite found\r\nin this island may be given:—_Plag, hypersth-aug, matr, orth, prism,\r\nphen, opac_. This is an andesite in which rhombic and monoclinic\r\npyroxene are associated both in the phenocrysts and in the groundmass\r\nwhere the pyroxene is prismatic and not granular. The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts are opaque and the felspars of the groundmass are of the\r\northophyric type.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two points that require further reference. In the first\r\nplace the early employment in the scheme of the characters of the\r\nfelspars of the groundmass for distinguishing the orders scarcely seems\r\nneeded in the cases where they take the lathe-form; but the importance\r\nof its early use is shown in the acid andesites where it is certainly of\r\nprime importance in an early stage of the classification to distinguish\r\nthe rocks by the character of the felspars of the groundmass, whether\r\nlathe-like, orthophyric, or felsitic. It may also be objected that the\r\ntwo orders obtained by dividing the lathe group into “parallel” and\r\n“non-parallel” divisions are not equivalents of the two other orders,\r\nthe orthophyric and the felsitic. The distinction, however, between the\r\nflow or non-flow arrangement, though in practice not always readily\r\nestablished, is a far-reaching one. On _à priori_ grounds the first\r\ndivision might be expected to have no plutonic equivalent; whilst in the\r\nsecond division, it is easy to trace the gradations through the\r\ndoleritic stage, where the felspar-lathes are very large, to the\r\ngranitoid condition. Then, again, the ophitic habit is as a general rule\r\nconfined to rocks with a doleritic or semi-doleritic groundmass, where\r\nthe felspar-lathes are coarse and form a mesh-work. Two quite distinct\r\nlines of development unite in the felspar-lathes and begin to diverge\r\nwith the difference in their arrangement in the groundmass.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the difference between the flow and non-flow arrangement\r\nof the felspar-lathes is well brought out in some dykes of basalt and\r\naugite-andesite that I examined in this island and also in the Valle del\r\nBove on the Etna slopes. In the outer vitreous portion the\r\nfelspar-lathes, which are fairly well represented, are all about the\r\nsame length and are more or less parallel with the sides of the dyke. In\r\nthe central more crystalline portion two sets of lathes can be\r\ndistinguished, one (_A_) corresponding in the average length and in the\r\nflow-arrangement with the lathes of the borders, the other (_B_) being\r\nabout half the length and forming a plexus between the larger parallel\r\nlathes. Those of the _A_ set, which are those that usually catch the eye\r\nin a section, are contemporaneous in their origin with those in the\r\nmargins of the dyke; whilst those of the _B_ set have been subsequently\r\nformed. In the preliminary “stiffening” of the first stage of\r\nconsolidation, the whole mass of the dyke would be affected. To this\r\nstage the lathes of the _A_ set belong; whilst to the later stage of\r\nconsolidation which would proceed much more slowly in the interior than\r\nat the margins of the dyke, the lathes of the _B_ set are to be\r\nreferred. This distinction so plainly illustrated in a dyke must be\r\npostulated for all intrusive masses; but I have not yet found it\r\npossible to make much use of it. Much ground will have first to be\r\ncleared before it can be safely employed, since it is apparent, for\r\ninstance, that there are often all gradations in a slide between a lathe\r\nand a phenocryst, and that the term “phenocryst” is applied to crystals\r\nhaving very different histories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram illustrating the two sets of felspar-lathes in a\r\ndyke: _A_, long and parallel, dispersed through the mass. _B_, short and\r\nnon-parallel and found only in the centre.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the ophitic habit of some of the basaltic rocks the\r\nfollowing conclusions may be drawn:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Typical ophitic “plates” are not very common in the slides. More\r\nfrequently the habit of the pyroxene is semi-ophitic.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This character is as a general rule associated with the plexus or\r\nnon-fluidal arrangement of the felspar lathes.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The felspar-lathes are nearly always large, frequently averaging\r\nmore than ·2 mm. in length. This coarse doleritic groundmass is almost\r\ndiagnostic of an ophitic rock.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not always possible to allow for the influence of locality in\r\ndrawing up such a classification as this, since it is well known that in\r\neach volcanic region the rocks have a particular facies recognisable in\r\nhand-specimens as well as in the slide, though it is not easy to express\r\nsuch a distinction in a definition. Perhaps this is represented in\r\n“adaptation” as we find it in the organic world, and the question arises\r\nas to the value of such characters for critical purposes. Regional\r\nvariation plays such an important part that it cannot be ignored in\r\nrock-classification.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SYNOPSIS\r\n\r\n               I.

short and stout\r\n                             (orthophyric).\r\n\r\n                FORMULA.—_Hypersth.-aug., matr., orth._\r\n\r\nREMARKS.—The same classification is to be employed here as in the case\r\nof the two previous orders, but as the rocks in my collection that\r\nbelong to this order are not numerous (nine sections), it will be\r\nsufficient to refer to the general remarks on the order on p. 290.\r\n\r\n\r\n           FOURTH ORDER OF THE HYPERSTHENE-AUGITE ANDESITES.\r\n\r\n          CHARACTERS.—Groundmass presenting a rudely granular\r\n             appearance or blurred mosaic (microfelsitic).\r\n\r\n                FORMULA.—_Hypersth.-aug., matr., fels._\r\n\r\nREMARKS.—My sliced specimens (five) are too few for the elaboration of\r\nthis order to which the classification employed for the other orders is\r\nscarcely applicable. This is due to the partial decomposition or\r\nimperfect development of the pyroxene of the groundmass. The general\r\ncharacters of the order are given on p. 291.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE PLUTONIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThese rocks are very infrequent and are for the most part\r\nhypersthene-gabbros or norites, with a few representatives of\r\ndiorites[110] without pyroxene. True plutonic rocks did not come under\r\nmy observation in the western half of the island (west of Lambasa and\r\nSavu-savu), those of Mount Thoka-singa in the Ndrandramea district\r\nmaking the nearest approach (see p. 302).

They\r\nare usually dark grey or steel-grey in colour with a specific gravity\r\nranging from 2·7 to 2·84 and have a granitoid aspect. The following\r\ncharacters are common to all the specimens.\r\n\r\nThey display a mixture of plagioclase and pyroxene, the last filling up\r\nthe spaces between the felspars and apparently of later formation. The\r\nplagioclase crystals, which are 1 to 2 mm. in size, are opaque; and\r\nsince they are traversed by numerous fine fissures filled with dust-like\r\ndecomposition products, their appearance is often semi-saussuritic. They\r\nare much cross-macled, are at times zoned, and give lamellar extinctions\r\nof andesine-labradorite (20°-30°).... The pyroxene includes both the\r\nrhombic and monoclinic forms, the last with extinction angles of over\r\n30°. They may be associated or may occur as separate crystals, the\r\nrhombic prevailing in the less basic and the monoclinic in the more\r\nbasic rocks. The rhombic pyroxene is usually more or less converted into\r\nbastite which by further change passes into a chloritic material; whilst\r\nthe augite sometimes undergoes the diallagic change resulting from\r\nschillerisation.\r\n\r\nSome special features are presented by rocks from different localities.\r\nThat from Nawi is most basic and looks like a diallage-gabbro. That from\r\nthe Valanga Range (sp. gr. 2·75) contains some quartz, apparently\r\nsecondary and filling up the interspaces. The rock from the Na Kula\r\nRidge shows traces of a groundmass; but it comes near the plutonic type.\r\n\r\nA HORNBLENDE-GABBRO.—This granitoid rock, which is from the Na Kula\r\nRidge, has a specific gravity of 2·72. Hand-specimens display large\r\nporphyritic crystals of hornblende (7 mm. long) in a base of opaque\r\nfelspar and smaller hornblende. In the slide we observe besides the\r\nlarge crystals of plagioclase and hornblende a little pyroxene; but the\r\nmass of the rock consists of greenish-brown hornblende, plagioclase, and\r\nsome secondary quartz, forming a coarse mosaic with a “grain” of about a\r\nmillimetre. The hornblende is displayed in regular hexagonal sections,\r\nmarkedly pleochroic, and gives extinctions up to 12°. It shows no dark\r\nresorption borders; and the larger porphyritic crystals have the same\r\ncharacters. Almost all the plagioclase of the rock is traversed by\r\nnumerous fine fissures, and often acquires a semi-saussuritic appearance\r\nfrom the presence of dust-like decomposition products. The lamellar\r\nextinctions indicate andesine-labradorite. The quartz occurs mostly in\r\nnests. The pyroxene is formed of large grains of both the monoclinic and\r\nrhombic types.\r\n\r\nTHE DIORITES.—The rock forming blocks in the Vunimbua River has a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·78 to 2·8. It is a pretty rock showing long black\r\nblades of hornblende, 10 mm. in length, in an opaque felspar base. In\r\nthe slide the hornblende, which is dark brown and markedly pleochroic,\r\nshows six-sided sections with characteristic prismatic cleavage lines,\r\nthe longitudinal sections giving extinctions up to 15°. The borders in\r\nsome cases display traces of resorption. The felspar (plagioclase) is in\r\nthe form usually of broad regular crystals, 3 to 4 mm. in size, and\r\ngiving extinctions of andesine-labradorite (28°); they are “clouded”\r\nthrough the presence of fine alteration products associated with\r\nnumerous fissures. The relation between the hornblende and the\r\nplagioclase is not constant. This appears to be partially due to the\r\noccurrence of traces of a groundmass.\r\n\r\nThe diorite forming blocks in the agglomerate of the coast cliffs, west\r\nof the Salt Lake Passage, is a remarkable rock showing large blackish\r\nhornblende crystals, in the shape of blades 25 mm. long and 3 or 4 mm.\r\nbroad, set in a base of opaque plagioclase felspar which surrounds the\r\nhornblende. The last-named is deep-brown, very pleochroic, yields\r\nextinctions up to 22°, and displays but little evidence of resorption.\r\nThe plagioclase is irregular in shape and exhibits broad lamellæ giving\r\nextinctions of acid labradorite (28°-30°). It is traversed by numerous\r\nfine fissures filled with decomposition products and contains abundant\r\ndust-like materials.

Although these\r\nrocks are not the most numerous of the basic rocks, they are well\r\nrepresented in the island, being in great part confined to the western\r\nhalf, and being especially characteristic of the districts of Wainunu\r\nand Solevu and of the mountains of Seatura and Naivaka. It will be seen\r\nfrom the Synopsis that this sub-class is split up into two divisions,\r\naccording to the relative abundance of the olivine. Many of the rocks\r\nare grey basalts with the olivine more or less hematised; but the\r\nmajority are blackish with the olivine usually more or less\r\nserpentinised. In the typical blackish rocks there is a little dark\r\nopaque interstitial glass. In the grey basalts the groundmass is as a\r\nrule holo-crystalline. The specific gravity ranges generally from 2·8 to\r\n3.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed in the scheme that the “prismatic” sub-orders, where\r\nthe pyroxene of the groundmass is for the most part in prisms, are\r\nscarcely represented. The “ophitic” sub-orders are poorly represented,\r\nsince they only include about 10 per cent. of the total. The ophitic\r\nolivine-basalts are indeed mostly confined to the division where the\r\nolivine is scanty, and the felspars of the groundmass are for the most\r\npart not parallel, the plexus arrangement, as will be often pointed out,\r\nbeing almost essential for the development of the ophitic structure.\r\nWith the basaltic andesites, which cannot always be sharply separated\r\nfrom the basalts with scanty olivine, the proportion of ophitic rocks is\r\nmuch higher, probably about 20 per cent. The pyroxene in the\r\nolivine-basalts is nearly always augite, intergrowths with rhombic\r\npyroxene being only occasionally observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   I. DIVISION OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Abundant olivine.\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop._\r\n\r\nThese rocks are characterised by abundant olivine usually as phenocrysts\r\nbut sometimes represented in the groundmass. When a basalt presents much\r\nof this mineral in an ordinary hand-specimen and displays at least five\r\nor six phenocrysts in a slide, it is placed in this division.\r\nOlivine-basalts of this character are well exhibited in the hills around\r\nSolevu Bay and in the neighbouring Seatovo Range. They are also fairly\r\nrepresented on the northern slopes of Mount Seatura, on the coast\r\nbetween the Wainunu River and Nandi Bay, and on the Wainunu basaltic\r\ntableland. In the Ulu-i-ndali Range, which lies east of the Wainunu\r\nestuary, they are especially frequent. Whilst confined mostly to the\r\nportion of the island west of Savu-savu Bay, they occur sporadically in\r\nother localities to the eastward, as in Na Suva-suva Hill and in some\r\nparts of the Natewa Peninsula. The grey basalts, which form one-third of\r\nthe total, are chiefly characteristic of the hill of Ulu-i-ndali, of the\r\nSolevu district, and of the northern slopes of Seatura. Whilst the\r\nblackish basalts usually compose the flows, the grey basalts form dykes\r\nand volcanic necks.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of these olivine-basalts belong to the order presenting\r\nflow-structure and almost all (28 out of 29) are included in the\r\nsub-order exhibiting granular augite in the groundmass. The ophitic\r\nstructure is displayed in only one case; and the prismatic form of the\r\naugites is never a predominant feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop, non-flu, gran, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Abundant olivine. Felspar-lathes of the groundmass not in\r\nflow arrangement. Pyroxene of the groundmass granular. Phenocrysts of\r\nglassy plagioclase.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Dark-brown or blackish rocks. Sp. gr. 2·88 to 2·93.\r\nPhenocrysts of pyroxene occur in fair quantity in addition to those of\r\nthe olivine and plagioclase. The groundmass displays a plexus of\r\nfelspars and augite-granules with much magnetite in grains and\r\nirregular patches. The interstitial glass is scanty or almost absent.\r\nThe olivine phenocrysts, of which the larger are 3 to 4 mm. in size,\r\nare as a rule hematised at the borders and in the fissures, and are\r\nsometimes partially serpentinised. In some cases small crystals of\r\nolivine are enclosed in the pyroxene-phenocrysts. The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts do not usually exceed 2 mm. in size. They give lamellar\r\nextinctions of 15°-28°, and are often cross-macled. They generally\r\ncontain magma-inclusions, which may be arranged in zones, and they\r\nsometimes inclose small pyroxene crystals. Their borders are often\r\neroded. The pyroxene-phenocrysts, which frequently are 3 to 4 mm. in\r\nsize, give extinctions of 30° and over, and may be described as\r\ncomposed of brown augite. It is only at times that intergrowths of\r\nrhombic pyroxene occur. They are often twinned and are sometimes\r\neroded and may contain magma and other inclusions. The felspars of the\r\ngroundmass, which for the most part form a plexus, are small and\r\nstout, their average length varying from ·08 to ·13 mm., whilst they\r\nfrequently display lamellar twinning and give extinctions of about 15°\r\n(oligoclase-andesine). The pyroxene-granules of the groundmass, which\r\nare of brown augite, vary in average size from ·02 to ·04 mm.\r\n\r\nTwo of the four species, where the felspar-lathes are less than ·1 mm.\r\nand between ·1 and ·2 mm. in length, are represented in this collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    2. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop, non-flu, gran, phen, opac._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Abundant olivine. Felspar-lathes of the groundmass not in\r\nflow-arrangement. Pyroxene of the groundmass granular. Phenocrysts of\r\nplagioclase opaque white.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Grey compact-looking rocks; sp. gr. 2·83 to 2·9.\r\nInterstitial glass scanty. The olivine phenocrysts, which range up to\r\n5 mm. in size, are more or less hematised; and in extreme cases of this\r\nalteration, where schiller-planes are formed, the hand-specimen appears\r\nto carry brown mica. There are sometimes small grains of olivine\r\n(·1 mm.) in the groundmass. The plagioclase-phenocrysts, varying in size\r\nfrom 2 to 4 mm., owe their opacity partly to their composite character,\r\nwhen they present an aggregate of smaller clear crystals, and partly to\r\nmultiple macling. They give extinctions of acid labradorite (25°-32°).\r\nPyroxene-phenocrysts, when present, are scanty, pale brown, not over\r\n2 mm. in size, and give the large extinctions (+30°) of augite. In their\r\nabsence small augites (·2 mm.) are frequent. Fine granules (·01-·03 mm.)\r\nof similar augite, together with magnetite, abound in the groundmass.\r\nThe felspars of the groundmass are fairly stout and lathe-like and show\r\nat times a few twin-lamellæ which give extinctions of 13° to 20° (medium\r\nandesine).\r\n\r\nSpecies represented:\r\n\r\n (_a_) felspar lathes ·1-·2 mm.\r\n (_b_) felspar lathes  ·2-·3 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    3. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop, non-flu, gran, non-phen, magn._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Abundant olivine. Felspar-lathes of the groundmass not in\r\nflow-arrangement. Pyroxene of the groundmass granular. No plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts. Large phenocrysts of olivine and pyroxene over 2 mm. in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—A remarkable blackish-grey rock. Although somewhat\r\nscoriaceous, it has a sp. gr. of 2·91. It displays large phenocrysts of\r\nolivine and pyroxene, 4 to 8 mm. in size, in a coarse-textured\r\ngroundmass of stout felspars, augite granules, magnetite and a little\r\nglass. The olivine is extensively hematised. The pyroxene phenocrysts\r\nare of brownish-yellow augite with regular outlines and giving angles of\r\nextinction up to 40°. The broad lamellar felspars of the groundmass,\r\nwhich are on the average ·3 to ·4 mm. long, give extinctions indicating\r\nboth acid labradorite (23° to 28°) and medium andesine (16° or 17°). The\r\nabundant augite-grains average ·05 mm. in size; but the prism form\r\noccurs at times.\r\n\r\nThe species with felspar-lathes ·3 to ·5 mm. long is alone represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    4. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop, non-flu, gran, non-phen, parv._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Abundant olivine. In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are\r\nnot in flow-arrangement and the pyroxene is granular. No plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts. Small phenocrysts of olivine and occasionally pyroxene\r\nunder 2 mm.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—A grey coarse-grained rock. Sp. gr. 2·9. It displays\r\nabundant small phenocrysts of olivine, all less than a millimetre in\r\nsize (·2-·8 mm.), which are hematised in the fissures and at the\r\nborders. The felspar-lathes, which display a few twin-lamellæ giving\r\nextinctions of 16°-18° (medium andesine), vary greatly in size. The\r\nsmaller are ·1 to ·3 mm. and the larger ·3 to ·5 mm. long; but the two\r\nare connected by felspars of intermediate length. The abundant augite\r\ngranules average ·037 mm. in breadth. Pyroxene phenocrysts are not\r\nrepresented in the slide. From its coarsely crystalline texture this\r\nrock merits the field-name of a grey doleritic basalt; and except in the\r\narrangement of the felspar-lathes it does not differ from the grey\r\ndoleritic basalts of genus 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    12. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop, non-flu, oph, non-phen, parv._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine abundant. Felspars of the groundmass not in\r\nflow-arrangement. Pyroxene of the groundmass ophitic or semi-ophitic. No\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts. Small phenocrysts (under 2 mm.) of olivine and\r\noccasionally a few of pyroxene.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—A dark greenish-brown rock, with sp. gr. 2·91, showing\r\nabundant micro-porphyritic olivine in a groundmass consisting of ophitic\r\npale-brown augite inclosing the felspar-lathes, together with small\r\nolivines, patches of magnetite, and a little altered interstitial glass.\r\nThe olivine-phenocrysts are about ·5 mm. in average size and are more or\r\nless hematised. The felspar-lathes, which average ·15 mm. in length,\r\noften show twin-lamellæ that give extinctions of 23°-30°\r\n(andesine-labradorite).\r\n\r\nThe species with felspar-lathes ·1-·2 mm. long is alone represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    13. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop, flu, gran, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine abundant. Felspars of the groundmass in\r\nflow-arrangement. Pyroxene of the groundmass granular. Phenocrysts of\r\nglassy plagioclase.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Dark grey or dark brown rocks with sp. gr. 2·88 to 2·99.\r\nPhenocrysts of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase occur in a groundmass\r\nshowing partially parallel felspar-lathes, abundant pyroxene grains, and\r\nfine magnetite, residual glass being scanty or absent. The\r\nolivine-phenocrysts do not exceed 3 or 4 mm. in size and in some rocks\r\nare less than 1 mm. They are usually more or less serpentinised and\r\nhematised at the borders and in the cracks; but sometimes they are\r\nalmost fresh and present regular outlines. In some rocks the olivine\r\nalso occurs as grains (·3 mm.) in the groundmass. When the phenocrysts\r\nof olivine have blackish borders they are surrounded by a halo, as\r\nthough the crystal had attracted the magnetite from the groundmass\r\nimmediately around. The plagioclase phenocrysts vary from 1 to 3 mm. in\r\nsize. They often contain abundant magma-inclusions and give lamellar\r\nextinctions of 15° to 25° (basic andesine). In some rocks they are\r\nrudely parallel. The pyroxene phenocrysts, which are of pale\r\nbrownish-yellow augite giving extinctions of over 30°, do not usually\r\nexceed 3 mm. They present regular octagonal cross-sections and sometimes\r\ndisplay lamellar twinning. Occasionally there is a suspicion of\r\nintergrowth with rhombic pyroxene. The felspar-lathes, which according\r\nto the species vary much in length, at times show a few lamellæ. The\r\naugite grains of the groundmass are abundant and are as a rule about\r\n·02 mm. in size; but in some rocks they are larger and in others\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nThis genus may be divided into two sub-genera, the porphyritic sub-genus\r\nwhere the felspar phenocrysts are larger than 3 mm., and the\r\nnon-porphyritic where they are smaller. All four species, as indicated\r\nby the length of the felspar-lathes, are represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    14. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop, flu, gran, phen, opac._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine abundant. Felspars of the groundmass in\r\nflow-arrangement. Pyroxene of the groundmass granular. Opaque\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Dark grey rocks, with sp. gr. 2·9 to 2·93, showing\r\nphenocrysts of olivine and pyroxene with opaque whitish phenocrysts of\r\nplagioclase in a groundmass of felspar lathes, pyroxene grains, and\r\nmagnetite, with occasional fine olivine. The olivine phenocrysts, which\r\nare sometimes 5 or 6 mm. in size, are often deeply eroded. They are at\r\ntimes so extensively hematised along the schiller-planes that they\r\nappear like brown mica. The plagioclase phenocrysts owe their opacity in\r\npart to their consisting of an aggregate of lesser crystals which are\r\nclear and glassy and give lamellar extinctions of 20° to 30° (andesine\r\nlabradorite). They do not usually exceed 3 mm. and are sometimes scanty.\r\nThe pyroxene phenocrysts, which are at times infrequent, may be 5 mm. in\r\nsize. They are of pale yellowish-brown augite, giving extinctions of\r\n40°. The felspar-lathes are rarely lamellar; but in one such case the\r\nangle of extinction was 17° (medium andesine). The grains of augite in\r\nthe groundmass average ·02 mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe only species represented is that with the felspar-lathes ·1 to\r\n·2 mm. long.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    15. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop, flu, gran, non-phen, magn._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Abundant olivine. In the groundmass the felspars are in\r\nflow-arrangement and the pyroxene is granular. No plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, but large phenocrysts, over 2 mm., of olivine and pyroxene.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—This genus includes the most basic rocks represented in my\r\ncollection. They are compact heavy blackish rocks with sp. gr. 3 to 3·1,\r\nand display large porphyritic crystals of olivine and pyroxene often 3\r\nor 4 mm. in size. The olivine phenocrysts may be fairly fresh with clean\r\noutlines, or they may be deeply eroded and stained by iron oxide, or\r\nthey may be passing into serpentine. The pyroxene phenocrysts may be\r\neither eroded or possess regular outlines. They are of pale brown augite\r\nand give extinctions over 30°. The pyroxene granules, which average\r\n·02 mm. and are very abundant, are of the same augite. The\r\nfelspar-lathes are relatively scanty. In the two rocks here included\r\nthey average in length ·06 mm. and ·08 mm. When lamellæ can be\r\nrecognised they give extinctions of 30°-40° (labradorite). The untwinned\r\nlathes give extinctions of 20°-28° (labradorite).\r\n\r\nThe only species represented is that with felspar-lathes less than\r\n·1 mm. in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    16. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, cop, flu, gran, non-phen, parv._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Abundant olivine. In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are\r\nin flow arrangement and the pyroxene is granular. There are no\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts; but there are numerous small phenocrysts, under\r\n2 mm. in size, of olivine and occasionally a few of pyroxene.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—As a highly basic genus this ranks next to the preceding\r\none, the specific gravity of the rocks ranging from 2·91 to 3·01. All\r\nthe four species indicated by the varying length of the felspar-lathes\r\nare represented in my collection. The rocks of the first two, with the\r\nfelspars averaging less than ·1 mm. and between ·1 and ·2 mm., are\r\ncompact aphanitic basalts, only displaying an occasional small\r\nphenocryst of augite and blackish-grey or bluish-black in colour. Those\r\nof the last two species, with the average length of the felspar-lathes\r\n·2-·3 mm. and ·3-·5 mm. respectively, are lightish-grey coarse-textured\r\nrocks of the doleritic type. In all the rocks no pyroxene phenocrysts\r\nare displayed in the slide; and the olivine phenocrysts, which are very\r\nnumerous, do not usually exceed 1 mm., though occasionally the average\r\nsize is 1·3 mm., and not infrequently it is only ·5 mm. In some cases\r\nwhere the larger olivine phenocrysts lie athwart the current of the\r\nfelspar-lathes, the smaller (·5 mm.) lie with their long axes parallel\r\nto the flow. The olivine is either fresh, or it may be beginning to\r\nserpentinise in the cracks, or it may be in part hematised. The crystals\r\nmay have regular outlines, or they may be rounded and sometimes deeply\r\neroded. The pyroxene granules of the groundmass are of pale-brown\r\naugite, and average ·01 to ·03 mm. in size. Occasionally a few prism\r\nforms occur, giving extinctions of 30° to 40°. In the case of the more\r\ncompact rocks, with the felspar-lathes averaging less than ·2 mm. in\r\nlength, lamellar twinning is but scantily to be noticed in the lathes,\r\nwhich give extinctions measured from the long axis of 20° to 25° and by\r\nthe twin lamellæ of 30° to 35°, indicative of acid labradorite in both\r\ninstances. With the coarser doleritic grey basalts, where the\r\nfelspar-lathes are stouter and have an average length exceeding ·2 mm.,\r\nlamellar twinning is more frequent; the extinctions afforded by the\r\nlamellæ range between 15° and 25° (medium andesine). Residual glass is\r\nscanty in these rocks, and in the grey dolerites it is often difficult\r\nto recognise any.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   2. DIVISION OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Scanty olivine.\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, pauc._\r\n\r\n\r\n                    25. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, pauc, non-flu, gran, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine scanty. Felspars (lathes and prisms) of the\r\ngroundmass not in flow-arrangement. Pyroxene of the groundmass granular.\r\nGlassy plagioclase phenocrysts.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—About two-thirds of these rocks have a common facies, being\r\nclosely similar in appearance, brownish-black in colour, and with spec.\r\ngrav. usually between 2·84 and 2·92. They belong to the species with the\r\nfelspar-lathes ·1 to ·2 mm. in length. They are essentially the rocks of\r\nthe old submarine basaltic flows; and they are often columnar, the\r\ncolumns being 2 to 4 feet across. My remarks will mainly apply to this\r\npredominant group.\r\n\r\nTo the eye they are somewhat compact and show scattered porphyritic\r\ncrystals of plagioclase. In the slide they display numerous phenocrysts\r\nof plagioclase, with a few of olivine and pyroxene, in a groundmass\r\nformed of stout lamellar felspar-lathes and small prisms forming a\r\nplexus with granular augite in the meshes. There is a good deal of\r\nmagnetite and generally scanty residual glass. The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts are usually 2 to 3 mm. in size, but they may be smaller (1\r\nto 2 mm.) or larger (3 to 5 mm. or more) when the rock has a porphyritic\r\nappearance.[111] They are often cross-macled and at times show zoning.\r\nIn many slides two kinds are distinguished by the extinctions which\r\nindicate in one case medium andesine (15° to 22°) and in the other acid\r\nlabradorite (27° to 32°). They contain inclusions of the magma and are\r\noften eroded. The pyroxene phenocrysts are of pale brown augite, scanty\r\nand small, and give extinctions of 30° to 40°. They are sometimes\r\ntwinned and may be eroded and contain inclusions of the magma. The\r\nolivine phenocrysts, which do not usually exceed 2 or 3 mm., are mostly\r\nrounded, but sometimes have the regular outlines, and are in various\r\nstages of serpentinisation. The felspars of the groundmass, which\r\naverage ·17 mm. in length, are mostly stout and lamellar; but they\r\nexhibit all transitions from the lathe-shape with one or two lamellæ to\r\nbroad multi-lamellar prisms where the breadth is half the length. They\r\ngive lamellar extinctions averaging 15° to 18° (andesine). The augite\r\ngranules of the groundmass are pale brown and average ·02 to ·03 mm. in\r\nsize. In a few cases they are larger (·05 mm.) which is an indication of\r\nan approach to the ophitic type. In most slides occur a few small\r\naugites of prism-form, two or three times the size of the granules,\r\nwhich give extinctions of over 30°. Where the phenocrysts of augite are\r\nvery scanty or absent, there exist large grains (·1 mm.) of an\r\nintermediate size. The magnetite is often abundant, occurring in\r\ncrystals, rods, and irregular masses, the last associated often with the\r\ninterstitial glass which is present in small quantities in most rocks,\r\nbeing greenish or brownish and showing fibrous devitrification.\r\n\r\nIn some localities semi-vitreous rocks referable to this genus are\r\nfrequent. This is especially the case in the Naivaka peninsula, where\r\nthe rocks show a fair amount of glass in the groundmass, the porphyritic\r\naugite being well developed, whilst the pyroxene of the groundmass is\r\nonly in part differentiated. Three of the four species are here\r\nrepresented. Those with large felspar-lathes (·2-·3 mm. long) and coarse\r\naugite granules (·05) approach the semi-ophitic rocks included in genus\r\n33.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    26. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, pauc, non-flu, gran, phen, opac._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine scanty. In the groundmass the felspar-lathes and\r\nprisms are not in flow-arrangement and the pyroxene is granular. The\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts are opaque.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Dark grey porphyritic rocks, which, from the opacity of the\r\nfelspar phenocrysts, look like porphyrites. They are not very frequent\r\nand occur mostly on the northern slopes of Mount Seatura. Two different\r\ntypes occur in my collection which may be regarded as sub-genera. In the\r\nmost basic kind, where the sp. gr. is 2·86 to 2·89, the plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, 2 to 3 mm. in size, owe their opacity chiefly to their\r\naggregate structure. They give lamellar extinctions (15°-30°) of\r\nandesine labradorite. Porphyritic olivine is scanty and more or less\r\nhematised; but a fair amount of olivine grains, less than ·1 mm., occur\r\nin the groundmass. Pyroxene phenocrysts are scanty, but microporphyritic\r\npale brown augite (·1 mm.) is frequent. In the groundmass are found\r\nstoutish felspar-lathes, averaging ·2 mm. long, together with an\r\nabundance of fine augite granules (·01-·02 mm.) and fine magnetite, the\r\nresidual glass being scanty.... In the other type the sp. gr. is 2·75;\r\nand the plagioclase phenocrysts 4 to 6 mm. in size give extinctions of\r\nandesine and acid labradorite (10°-30°). There is an approach to the\r\northophyric structure in the groundmass, as is indicated by the number\r\nof short broad felspars, averaging ·2 mm. in length and giving lamellar\r\nextinctions of acid and basic andesine. The granular augite of the\r\ngroundmass is coarse (·04 mm.), and occasional prism-forms give\r\nextinctions of 40°.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    33. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, pauc, non-flu, oph, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine scanty. In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are not\r\nin flow-arrangement and the pyroxene is ophitic or semi-ophitic.\r\nPlagioclase phenocrysts glassy.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—These brownish-black rocks are all of the semi-ophitic\r\ntype. Although no ophitic “plates” occur in the slide, the augites of\r\nthe groundmass have no longer the granular form, but are large,\r\n·08-·1 mm. in size, and tend to invest the felspar-lathes. The specific\r\ngravity ranges from 2·78 to 2·86. As in other of the ophitic and\r\nsemi-ophitic rocks of this collection (genera 9, 10, 12, of the\r\naugite-andesites), the large size of the felspar-lathes (·2-·3 mm. long)\r\nof the groundmass gives a doleritic texture in the slide. In most of the\r\nother characters these rocks approach those of genus 25 which possess\r\nfelspar-lathes more than ·2 mm. in length. But they are more often\r\nsemi-vitreous, and display a considerable amount of dark smoky glass\r\nshowing numerous magnetite rods and skeletal crystals with fibrous\r\ndevitrification. The plagioclase phenocrysts, which vary much in size in\r\ndifferent rocks (in some 2 or 3 mm., in others 4 or 5 mm.), give\r\nextinctions of andesine labradorite (20°-35°). They are often eroded and\r\ncontain numerous large black inclusions of the magma. The pyroxene\r\nphenocrysts, which are of pale-brown augite, often have an\r\naggregate-structure, having been formed _in situ_. Others again consist\r\nof single crystals and have been much affected by the magma. The olivine\r\nphenocrysts, which are at times deeply eroded, are generally small and\r\nin part serpentinised.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    37. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, pauc, flu, gran, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine scanty. In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are in\r\nflow-arrangement and the pyroxene is granular. Glassy plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Brownish-black rocks which cannot be distinguished, except\r\nin the flow-arrangement of the felspars of the groundmass, from those\r\ndescribed under genus 25. Like them they enter into the formation of the\r\nbasaltic plains of Sarawanga and Mbua and elsewhere. Most of the rocks\r\nof this genus group themselves into one type where the felspar-lathes\r\naverage in length ·15-·21 mm. The sp. gr. is usually between 2·87 and\r\n2·91. Though rarely porphyritic, such rocks display to the eye a few\r\nsmall scattered glassy phenocrysts of plagioclase and an occasional\r\ngrain of olivine. It is to this type of the genus that the following\r\ndescription applies.\r\n\r\nIn the thin sections they display small plagioclase phenocrysts, with a\r\nfew of olivine and occasionally of pyroxene, in a groundmass where the\r\nflow-arrangement of the felspar-lathes is well marked, the rest of the\r\ngroundmass being made up of granular augite with magnetite and generally\r\na little residual glass.... The plagioclase phenocrysts do not usually\r\nexceed 2 mm. in size and contain magma inclusions. Two kinds are often\r\nindicated in the same slide by the extinctions, namely, one of medium\r\nandesine (17°-22°), and the other of acid labradorite (28°-33°).... The\r\npyroxene phenocrysts are of pale brown augite; but they are small (less\r\nthan 2 mm.), scanty, and often absent when their place is taken by\r\nmicroporphyritic augite, ·2 mm. in size.... The olivine phenocrysts are\r\ngenerally small. Though sometimes showing the long hexagonal sections,\r\nthey are often rounded and more or less serpentinised.... The felspars\r\nof the groundmass present more typical lathes than are to be observed in\r\nthe non-parallel felspars of the rocks of genus 25. The twin-lamellæ,\r\nwhen present, are fewer; but give similar extinctions (15°-21°) of\r\nmedium andesine.... The augite granules are, as a rule, ·02 or ·03 mm.\r\nin diameter; but occasional more prismatic forms occur, two or three\r\ntimes the length, which give extinctions of over 30°. The magnetite is\r\nabundant, and the scanty interstitial glass is green or brown and\r\ndisplays fibrous devitrification.\r\n\r\nThe following three species, as indicated by the length of the\r\nfelspar-lathes, are represented in my collection:\r\n\r\n (_a_) ·02-·1 mm.\r\n (_b_) ·1-·2 mm.\r\n (_c_) ·2-·3 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    38. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, pauc, flu, gran, phen, opac._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine scanty. In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are in\r\nflow-arrangement and the pyroxene is granular. Opaque plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Grey rocks, sp. gr. 2·78 to 2·83, showing small opaque\r\nporphyritic crystals of plagioclase with a few phenocrysts of olivine\r\nand pyroxene in a groundmass of parallel felspar-lathes, augite\r\ngranules, and magnetite, with very scanty, if any, interstitial\r\nglass.... The plagioclase phenocrysts, 2 to 3 mm. in size, are often\r\naggregates of smaller crystals. They contain colourless granular\r\ninclusions and are sometimes zoned, giving extinctions of medium\r\nandesite (15°-18°), and of andesine labradorite (25°-29°).... The\r\npyroxene phenocrysts are pale-brown, scanty, 2 to 3 mm. in size, often\r\ntwinned and give the large extinctions of augite.... The olivine\r\nphenocrysts, which do not exceed 2 or 3 mm., are deeply eroded by the\r\nmagma and are hematised and schillerised. Small grains also occur in the\r\ngroundmass.... The felspar-lathes, which in the species here represented\r\naverage ·15 mm. in length, are stout and give lamellar extinctions of\r\nandesine (18°-22°).... The augite granules are pale-brown and usually\r\n·02-·03 mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe only species represented in my collection is that with the\r\nfelspar-lathes ·1-·2 mm. long.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    40. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, pauc, flu, gran, non-phen, parv._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine scanty. In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are in\r\nflow-arrangement and the pyroxene is granular. No plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts; but there are a few small phenocrysts of olivine and\r\nsometimes of pyroxene under 2 mm. in size.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Compact-looking non-porphyritic blackish-brown rocks, sp.\r\ngr. about 2·9. Occasionally a little vesicular. For the most part\r\ndyke-rocks.\r\n\r\nIn the slide are displayed a few small phenocrysts of olivine and\r\npyroxene in a groundmass formed of more or less parallel felspar-lathes,\r\naugite granules, magnetite, sometimes in rods, and a little greenish\r\ndevitrified residual glass.... The pyroxene phenocrysts are of\r\npale-brown augite and are generally less than a millimetre in size. They\r\nmay be single crystals or they may be formed of an aggregate of a few\r\nsmaller crystals.... The olivine phenocrysts rarely exceed 2 mm. in size\r\nand are in part serpentinised.... The augite granules vary usually from\r\n·01 to ·03 mm. in diameter.... The felspar-lathes of the rocks in this\r\ncollection are large, often exceeding ·2 mm. in length, giving the rock\r\na doleritic texture in the slide. In a single slide they may range from\r\n·1 to ·6 mm. When lamellar they give extinctions of 15° to 25° (basic\r\nandesine).\r\n\r\nTwo species are represented in this collection:--\r\n\r\n (_a_) with felspar-lathes ·2-·3 mm.\r\n (_b_) with felspar-lathes ·3-·5 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    44. GENUS OF THE OLIVINE-BASALTS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Oliv, matr, pauc, flu, prism, non-phen, parv._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Olivine scanty. In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are in\r\nflow-arrangement and the pyroxene is in great part prismatic. There are\r\nno phenocrysts of plagioclase; but there are a few small phenocrysts of\r\nolivine and sometimes of pyroxene, less than 2 mm. in size.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—A dark grey compactish rock; sp. gr. 2·9; showing a little\r\nmacroscopic olivine; forming a dyke in the tuffs on the summit of the\r\nhill of Vatui (p. 54).\r\n\r\nIn the section it exhibits a few phenocrysts of olivine (more or less\r\nserpentinised) and of augite in a groundmass formed of stout augite\r\nprisms and small augite granules with felspar-lathes, magnetite, and a\r\nlittle devitrified yellowish interstitial glass. The augite prisms and\r\nthe felspar-lathes are in flow-arrangement.... The pyroxene phenocrysts,\r\nwhich are pale brown and give extinctions of over 30° from the single\r\ncleavage-lines, may be aggregates of five or six smaller crystals or\r\nsingle crystals presenting sometimes lamellar twinning. The first are\r\ndoubtless formed _in situ_. The second though showing regular outlines\r\nmay have a nucleus giving a different extinction and possessing eroded\r\nmargins. The stout augite prisms of the groundmass, which are\r\noccasionally twinned, have an average length of ·2 to ·3 mm. and give\r\nangles of extinction with the long axis of 30° to 40°. The\r\nfelspar-lathes average only ·07 mm. in length and afford extinctions,\r\nwhen untwinned, of 18° to 24° (acid labradorite).\r\n\r\nThe only species represented is that where the average length of the\r\nfelspar-lathes is between ·02 and ·1 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n             THE VOLCANIC ROCKS OF VANUA LEVU (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              AUGITE CLASS\r\n\r\n                              SUB-CLASS II\r\n\r\n           AUGITE-ANDESITES INCLUDING THE BASALTIC ANDESITES\r\n                          (_Plag, aug, matr._)\r\n\r\nTHIS sub-class, which comprises 40 per cent. of the volcanic rocks, is\r\ncharacterised by the absence of olivine on the one hand, and by the\r\nrarity or absence of rhombic pyroxene on the other. On the basic side it\r\nshades into the olivine-basalts through the basaltic andesites, and on\r\nthe acid side by intermediate stages into the hypersthene augite\r\nandesites; and for these reasons it is not always possible to draw a\r\nsharp line of distinction. In cases where a hand-specimen displays no\r\nmacroscopic olivine and where a solitary small phenocryst of olivine is\r\nalone observed in the slide, it should be referred to this sub-class;\r\nand here also all doubtful specimens as regards the occurrence of\r\nolivine should be placed. When the question of the occurrence of rhombic\r\npyroxene arises, it should be remembered that the great prevalence of\r\nmonoclinic pyroxene amongst the phenocrysts and the practical absence of\r\nrhombic pyroxene from the groundmass are essential characteristics of\r\nthis sub-class. Rhombic pyroxene is only indicated at times by\r\nintergrowths in the phenocrysts.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic andesites enter into the formation of old “flows,” as in\r\nthe Mbua and Ndama plains. The other rocks enter principally into the\r\ncomposition of dykes, necks, and agglomerates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                I. GRANULAR SUB-ORDER (AUGITE-ANDESITES)\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, gran._\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, gran, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes and prisms are not in\r\nflow-arrangement and the augite is granular. Phenocrysts of glassy\r\nplagioclase.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—These rocks frequently form dykes; and it is probable that\r\nmost of the instances where the nature of the exposure could not be\r\nascertained also fall into this category. They are dark-brown or\r\nblackish, and their sp. gr. ranges, except in the semi-vitreous rocks,\r\nfrom 2·7 to 2·83. They are sometimes vesicular, and rocks with abundant\r\ninterstitial glass are common. They admit of grouping into two\r\nsub-genera according to the size of the plagioclase phenocrysts:\r\n\r\n (_a_) Porphyritic, where the average size is 3 mm. or over.\r\n (_b_) Non-porphyritic where the average size is less than 3 mm.\r\n\r\nNearly all the rocks in my collection belong to the second group.\r\n\r\nIn the sections they display phenocrysts of plagioclase and occasionally\r\nof pyroxene in a groundmass formed of a plexus of felspar-lathes, augite\r\ngranules, magnetite, and usually a fair amount of smoky more or less\r\nopaque interstitial glass.... The felspar phenocrysts, which are\r\nsometimes abundant, give lamellar extinctions of andesine labradorite\r\n(15° to 30°). They are frequently small (1 to 2 mm.) and contain often\r\nmany magma-inclusions. Whilst the corroded aspect of some indicate that\r\nthey belong to an earlier period, the aggregate character and regular\r\noutlines of others suggest that they have been produced in position....\r\nPyroxene phenocrysts are absent in half the rocks. When present they are\r\ngenerally small and of a pale augite which gives extinctions of 30°.\r\nTheir size does not usually exceed 2 mm.; and they may consist of single\r\ncrystals (sometimes twinned) or of an aggregate of smaller crystals. At\r\ntimes there is a suspicion of intergrowth with rhombic pyroxene; but no\r\nphenocrysts formed alone of that mineral occur.... The augite granules\r\nof the groundmass as a rule vary from ·02 to ·04 mm. in diameter.\r\nOccasional prism-forms giving large extinctions occur.... The\r\nfelspar-lathes vary much in length in different rocks. In some they\r\naverage as little as ·05 mm., and in others as much as ·2 mm.; but the\r\ndoleritic type with yet longer lathes is not represented in the\r\ncollection except among the altered rocks. Most of the lathes show a\r\nsingle median twin-line, and when broader they display twin-lamellæ. The\r\nangles of extinction indicate acid and basic andesine.\r\n\r\nThree out of the eight species distinguished by the length of the\r\nfelspar-lathes occur in my collection, that with the longest lathes\r\n(·3-·5 mm.) being not represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    2. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, gran, phen, opac._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes and prisms are not in\r\nflow-arrangement and the augite is granular. Opaque plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—This genus may be divided into two groups according to the\r\nsize of the plagioclase phenocrysts, the first “porphyritic,” where they\r\naverage 3 mm. and over, the second “non-porphyritic,” where they are\r\nsmaller than 3 mm., usually not over 2 mm. The former would include some\r\nof the “porphyrites,” and to this only one of the rocks sliced is to be\r\nreferred. All the rest belong to the non-porphyritic type; and several\r\nof them are rocks that have undergone the propylitic change, as\r\nindicated by the formation of pyrites, chlorite, calcite, and other\r\nalteration-products.\r\n\r\n(_a_) PORPHYRITIC SUB-GENUS.—A greyish rock, with sp. gr. 2·78, showing\r\nabundant porphyritic opaque plagioclase (4 to 7 mm.), from the vicinity\r\nof Satulaki. These phenocrysts are often aggregates of lesser crystals,\r\nor they may be extensively cross-macled. They are traversed by numerous\r\nfine cracks and show much dust-like included material. They are in part\r\ncorroded by the magma and give evidence of fracture in their present\r\nposition, the re-union being sometimes effected by the growth of new\r\nsubstance. Their lamellar extinctions (10° to 20°) are those of\r\nandesine. The groundmass displays a plexus of stout felspar-lathes,\r\naveraging ·1 mm. long, with the meshes occupied by coarse augite\r\ngranules, ·03 to ·05 mm., with little, if any, interstitial glass. The\r\nfelspars are often lamellar and give extinctions like those of the\r\nphenocrysts.\r\n\r\n(_b_) NON-PORPHYRITIC SUB-GENUS.—Reference will first be made to some of\r\nthe propylitic rocks of the dykes of the Ndriti Basin which belong to\r\nthis group (see p. 70). They are greenish or greyish, with sp. gr. 2·76\r\nto 2·8, and often sparkle with pyrites and contain secondary calcite,\r\nsometimes to such an extent that they might be taken at first sight for\r\nimpure limestones.\r\n\r\nThe small opaque plagioclase phenocrysts (under 2 mm.), that they\r\ncontain, are more evident in the slide than in the hand-specimen, and\r\nscarcely give a macroscopic character to the rock. They give extinctions\r\n(10° to 30°) ranging from those of acid andesine to acid labradorite,\r\nand are traversed by numerous cracks occupied by calcitic and other\r\nalteration products. The few pyroxene phenocrysts that once existed are\r\nnow entirely represented by chloritic pseudomorphs. The groundmass\r\ndisplays a doleritic texture, exhibiting a plexus of long\r\nfelspar-lathes, ·2 to ·4 mm. in average length, which often present a\r\nfalse resemblance to a flow-arrangement from their aggregation into\r\nbundles. They are often clouded by secondary products, but occasionally\r\ngive lamellar extinctions (20° to 30°) indicating andesine labradorite.\r\nThe rest of the groundmass is greatly altered, the granular augite and\r\nthe interstitial glass, which originally existed in fair amount, being\r\nreplaced by calcite, chlorite, pyrites, and occasionally epidote, so\r\nthat the rock mass appears largely impregnated with alteration products.\r\nIn addition there is much secondary magnetite, and in some cases there\r\nare a few minute cavities filled with chalcedonic silica and zeolites.\r\n\r\nReference may here be made to a singular rock from Ruku-ruku Bay, which\r\nresembles the Ndriti rocks in its propylitic alteration, but the\r\nfelspar-lathes of the groundmass, ·21 mm. in length, give the small\r\nextinctions of oligoclase. Spec. grav. 2·61.\r\n\r\nMost of the prevailing rocks of Mount Freeland belong to this sub-genus.\r\nThey are dark grey and show small opaque plagioclase phenocrysts 1 or\r\n2 mm. in size. They usually, however, are more or less altered, the\r\nchange being often of the propylitic type, calcite, chloritic material,\r\nviridite, and occasionally pyrites occurring as alteration products. The\r\nspecific gravity of the altered rocks is 2·61-2·69; that of the least\r\naffected is about 2·76. They all, however, belong to the same genus,\r\ndisplaying small phenocrysts of plagioclase and augite in a groundmass\r\ncomposed of minute stoutish felspar-lathes (·03-·06 mm.), augite\r\ngranules, magnetite, and a little residual glass. The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts owe their opacity partly to the numerous fine cracks\r\ntraversing them and partly to the alteration products. The pyroxene\r\nphenocrysts, which are mostly of pale yellow augite, display at times\r\nintergrowths of rhombic pyroxene.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    4. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, gran, non-phen, parv._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes and prisms are not in\r\nflow-arrangement and the augite is granular. There are no plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, and those of augite when present are small (under 2 mm.).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Two groups of these rocks occur in my collection. In the\r\none there are vesicular and scoriaceous rocks forming dykes near\r\nNukunase and near the village of Ndriti. They display a plexus of\r\nfelspar-lathes with abundant smoky more or less devitrified glass, the\r\naugite granules not being always differentiated. The felspar-lathes vary\r\nfrom ·1 to ·2 mm. in average length, and when lamellar give extinctions\r\nof basic andesine (25°). There are no pyroxene phenocrysts, and the\r\naugite granules when present average ·02 mm. in size.\r\n\r\nIn the other group are included some propylites from the dykes of the\r\nNdriti Basin. They are greyish or greenish rocks, have a sp. gr. of 2·72\r\nto 2·76, sparkle often with pyrites, and contain so much secondary\r\ncalcite that they effervesce freely with an acid. Except in the rarity\r\nor absence of plagioclase phenocrysts, they come near to the propylitic\r\nrocks described under genus 2. They usually display a doleritic\r\ngroundmass exhibiting long felspar-lathes, ·2 to ·33 mm. in length,\r\nwhich present the same pseudo-flow arrangement from their being gathered\r\ninto bundles. The alteration corresponds precisely to that previously\r\ndescribed, chlorite, epidote, pyrites, &c., occurring in quantity as\r\nsecondary products.\r\n\r\n\r\n          II PRISMATIC SUB-ORDER OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES WHERE\r\n             THE FELSPAR-LATHES ARE NOT IN FLOW-ARRANGEMENT\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, prism._\r\n\r\nThe augite-andesites, which display in the groundmass a plexus of\r\nfelspar-lathes and much prismatic pyroxene, are not frequent in my\r\ncollection. About half of the specimens belong to agglomerates, whilst\r\nthe rest are of the massive type, none apparently being obtained from\r\ndykes. They admit of the same classification as that generally adopted\r\nfor the “granular” sub-orders; and it must be not forgotten that\r\ngranular pyroxene also occurs but is not predominant.\r\n\r\n5. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, prism, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes and prisms are not in\r\nflow-arrangement and the augite is for the most part prismatic.\r\nPlagioclase phenocrysts glassy.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Except as regards the prismatic pyroxene these rocks do not\r\ndiffer much from the “granular” augite-andesites. Those before me show\r\nphenocrysts of plagioclase and sometimes of augite in a groundmass\r\ndisplaying a mesh-work of felspar-lathes, prismatic pyroxene, and much\r\ninterstitial glass.... The plagioclase phenocrysts, 1 to 3 mm. in size,\r\nshow abundant magma-inclusions arranged either zone-wise or parallel to\r\nthe twinning-planes. They are often eroded.... The phenocrysts of\r\naugite, which give extinctions of over 30°, are often rounded and\r\ndisplay glass and other inclusions.... The prismatic pyroxenes of the\r\ngroundmass vary in average length from ·03 to ·08 mm. They have the\r\npeculiar pale muddy brown hue characteristic of the prismatic augite in\r\nthese rocks, and give oblique extinctions up to 30° and over. They may\r\nbe short and broad or long and slender, and when there is much glass in\r\nthe rock they resemble the felspar-lathes in their forked and imperfect\r\nextremities. Granular pyroxene occurs, but is subordinate.... The\r\nfelspar-lathes, ·1 mm. long, are rarely lamellar, and give extinctions\r\nmeasured from their long axis of 20° (basic andesine).\r\n\r\n\r\n                    6. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, prism, phen, opac._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are not in\r\nflow-arrangement and the augite is for the most part prismatic. The\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts are opaque.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Light and dark grey rocks displaying abundant opaque\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts not exceeding 2·5 mm. They are somewhat altered,\r\none of the specimens having a sp. gr. of 2·68.\r\n\r\nIn the section they exhibit phenocrysts of plagioclase, and occasionally\r\nof augite in a groundmass of felspar-lathes, pyroxene prisms and\r\ngranules (the former predominating), with a fair amount of altered\r\ninterstitial glass.... The plagioclase phenocrysts owe their opacity to\r\nthe great number of fine and sometimes parallel cracks filled with\r\nalteration products, that traverse them. Although much of their original\r\nmaterial has often disappeared, they still display the lamellar twinning\r\nof medium andesine (15° to 20°).... The phenocrysts of pale yellowish\r\naugite, which give the large extinctions of that mineral, exhibit but\r\nlittle alteration, although lying in the same slide with those of the\r\nplagioclase.... The pyroxene prisms of the groundmass are of the same\r\nyellowish augite. They are broad with rounded extremities and are\r\narranged in a loose plexus.... The felspars of the groundmass, which\r\naverage ·1 mm. in length and give extinctions of medium andesine, are\r\neither lathe-shaped or short and broad when they display lamellæ. The\r\nlast-named approach the orthophyric type, and such rocks come near the\r\nporphyrites; but I do not feel justified in placing them in a separate\r\northophyric order.\r\n\r\n\r\n         III OPHITIC SUB-ORDER OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES WITH THE\r\n          FELSPARS OF THE GROUNDMASS NOT IN FLOW-ARRANGEMENT.\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, oph._\r\n\r\nThese rocks form generally ancient flows. They are for the most part\r\nsemi-ophitic, large ophitic “plates” being uncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    9. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, oph, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—The felspar-lathes and prisms of the groundmass are not in\r\nflow-arrangement. The augite of the groundmass is ophitic or\r\nsemi-ophitic. Glassy plagioclase phenocrysts.\r\n\r\nThis genus may be divided into two sub-genera,\r\n\r\n (_a_) Porphyritic, where the average size of the plagioclase\r\n    phenocrysts\r\n is 3 mm. and over.\r\n\r\n (_b_) Non-porphyritic, where the size is less than 3 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A. PORPHYRITIC SUB-GENUS\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Coarse-looking brownish-black porphyritic rocks displaying\r\nlarge plagioclase crystals that often show a play of colours. Their sp.\r\ngr. is about 2·8. None of the rocks in my collection are vesicular. On\r\naccount of the considerable porphyritic development of the plagioclase,\r\nthe groundmass is relatively diminished, the large phenocrysts occupying\r\nabout a third of the mass. They form ancient basaltic flows more\r\nespecially in the vicinity of the isolated hills and mountains of acid\r\nandesite, as around Vatu Kaisia; whilst they may enter into the\r\nformation of the low basaltic plains as in the region west and south of\r\nthe Ndreketi River. They are, however, limited in their extent and\r\noccurrence. From the large amount of glass in the groundmass, they may\r\nbe inferred to belong to flows formed under different conditions from\r\nthose under which the great basaltic plateaux were formed, where the\r\nrock contains but scanty interstitial glass.\r\n\r\nIn the slide they show the large plagioclase phenocrysts together with a\r\nfew small plates of ophitic augite in a groundmass displaying in an\r\nabundant smoky glass a loose plexus of long stout lathe-like plagioclase\r\nprisms partly wrapped around by lesser augites.... The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, which attain a size of 4 to 6 mm., give lamellar\r\nextinctions of basic andesine (20°-27°) and show concentric zone-lines\r\nwith transmitted light. They often polarise in brilliant colours and are\r\nextensively cross-macled. They contain usually abundant inclusions of\r\nthe magma sometimes arranged zone-wise, and are frequently eroded....\r\nNon-ophitic pyroxene phenocrysts are uncommon. In the slide occur one or\r\ntwo small “plates,” 1 to 2 mm. in size, of ophitic pale-brown augite,\r\nand a number of lesser augites, ·2 to ·3 mm. in size, which in part wrap\r\naround the felspar-lathes and by their aggregation form imperfect\r\nophitic “plates.”... The long stout felspar-lathes, which are on the\r\naverage ·3 to ·45 mm. in length, give lamellar extinctions of 15° to 20°\r\n(medium andesine).... The copious smoky glass is rendered partially\r\nopaque by the abundant development of rods and skeletal crystals of\r\nmagnetite, and shows the fibrous devitrification arising from the\r\nformation of incipient microliths. In some rocks there appear in the\r\nsmoky glass brownish-yellow patches of the residual magma which under\r\nthe microscope cannot be distinguished from palagonite.\r\n\r\nAll but one of the specimens belong to the species where the\r\nfelspar-lathes average over ·3 mm. in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      B. NON-PORPHYRITIC SUB-GENUS\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Blackish-brown semi-ophitic rocks, sp. gr. 2·74-2·77,\r\nfrequently of doleritic texture and showing a few small macroscopic\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts. They are sometimes vesicular, and form old\r\nflows in a few localities, as in the vicinity of Natua in the eastern\r\npart of the Ndreketi plains and in the coast district between Lekutu and\r\nWailea Bay.\r\n\r\nThey display in the slide small plagioclase phenocrysts, often abundant,\r\nin a groundmass exhibiting a loose plexus of large lathe-shaped felspar\r\nprisms, together with occasional small ophitic “plates” of augite and\r\nnumerous smaller semi-ophitic augites, whilst there is much interstitial\r\nsmoky glass.... The plagioclase phenocrysts are as a rule 1 to 2 mm. in\r\nsize and do not exceed 3 mm. They often contain abundant inclusions of\r\nthe magma sometimes arranged schiller-fashion, and are frequently\r\neroded. Their lamellar extinctions (15°-30°)indicate andesine\r\nlabradorite.... The stout plagioclase lathes, which in most of my\r\nspecimens range between ·2 and ·3 mm., and contain at times\r\nmagma-inclusions, give the rocks their doleritic texture.... The\r\noccasional small ophitic “plates” of pale augite are not over 1 mm. in\r\nsize and give extinctions of +30° from the single cleavage-lines. The\r\nlesser augites, ·2 mm. in size, are several times larger than typical\r\ngranular pyroxenes (·02-·03 mm.), and adapt their form to the\r\ninterspaces of the felspar-lathes which they in part invest.... The\r\ncopious interstitial glass is generally smoky and sometimes quite opaque\r\nthrough the deposition of magnetite. It is never clear and isotropic,\r\nbut displays fibrous devitrification and is usually a little altered.\r\n\r\nThese rocks come near to those of the previous sub-genus in several\r\nrespects, but they differ conspicuously in their non-porphyritic\r\ncharacter, in being sometimes vesicular, and in their general\r\nappearance. All the four species indicated by the length of the\r\nfelspar-lathes are here represented; but the doleritic types with the\r\nlathes exceeding ·2 mm. are the most frequent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   10. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, oph, phen, opac._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes and prisms are not in\r\nflow-arrangement and the augite is ophitic or semi-ophitic. The\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts are opaque.\r\n\r\nThis genus may be divided into two sub-genera, porphyritic and\r\nnon-porphyritic, according to the average size of the plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, whether above or below 3 mm.\r\n\r\nA. PORPHYRITIC SUB-GENUS.—This is represented by a light grey\r\nporphyritic rock, with sp. gr. 2·75, from the lower part of Mount\r\nFreeland. It comes near to the porphyrites, and displays large opaque\r\nwhite phenocrysts of plagioclase 5 or 6 mm. long. It is a somewhat\r\naltered rock.\r\n\r\nIn the thin section it displays the plagioclase phenocrysts in a ground\r\nmass of doleritic and semi-ophitic texture showing a plexus of long\r\nfelspar-lathes partly invested by small augites with a fair amount of\r\naltered greenish opaque interstitial glass.... The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, which give extinctions of 11° to 15° (acid andesine), are\r\ntraversed by a network of fine cracks and contain a quantity of\r\ncolourless dust-like inclusions and alteration-products. They are long\r\nand rectilinear in outline and are not much affected by the magma....\r\nThe felspar-lathes, which average ·26 mm. in length, are occasionally\r\nlamellar when the angle of extinction indicates acid andesine. Like the\r\nphenocrysts they contain many dust-like inclusions.... The augite may at\r\ntimes form an aggregate phenocryst of small size; but usually it occurs\r\nas semi-ophitic masses ·1 mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nB. NON-PORPHYRITIC SUB-GENUS.—The specimen representing this group is a\r\ncoarse-grained greyish altered rock, sp. gr. 2·81, found in blocks near\r\nWaikatakata (p. 204), showing small somewhat opaque plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts. In the section these phenocrysts are displayed in numbers\r\ntogether with a few of augite. The groundmass, doleritic in texture in\r\nthis species, displays a plexus of long stout felspar-lathes with\r\nnumerous semi-ophitic lesser augites, chloritic pseudomorphs after\r\npyroxene, and scanty interstitial altered glass.... The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, 2 to 3 mm. in size, give extinctions (22° to 28°) of basic\r\nandesine. They are traversed by many fine cracks and contain an\r\nabundance of colourless dust-like inclusions, apparently altered magma\r\nproducts.... The small pyroxene phenocrysts consist of aggregates of\r\nsmaller crystals of pale augite. The lesser augites, ·1 mm. in size,\r\npartly invest the felspars.... The broad felspar-lathes, which average\r\n·25 mm. in length and give lamellar extinctions of medium andesine\r\n(15°), contain inclusions similar to those of the phenocrysts.... The\r\nscanty interstitial glass is converted into viriditic and chloritic\r\nmaterials. Secondary calcite also occurs here and in the chloritic\r\npseudomorphs.\r\n\r\nThe only species represented is that with felspar-lathes ·2 to ·3 mm. in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   12. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, non-flu, oph, non-phen, parv._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar lathes and prisms are not in\r\nflow-arrangement and the augite is ophitic or semi-ophitic. No\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts. Augite phenocrysts when present less than 2 mm.\r\nin size.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—These rocks come near to the non-porphyritic group of genus\r\n9; but differ in the absence or rarity of plagioclase phenocrysts, in\r\ntheir more frequently vesicular and scoriaceous character, and in the\r\nfresher condition of the rock. Their sp. gr. is about 2·77. They present\r\nthemselves usually as blackish-brown doleritic rocks and form ancient\r\nflows in the coast-plains, sometimes exhibiting a columnar structure as\r\nin the crossing of the Ndreketi above Mbatiri. They are, however, of\r\nlimited occurrence and are mostly represented in the Ndreketi plains and\r\nin the district between the Lekutu River and Wailea Bay.\r\n\r\nTypically they display in thin sections no phenocrysts either of\r\nplagioclase or of pyroxene, and exhibit a plexus of usually long stout\r\nfelspar-lathes partly invested by the lesser augites in a copious\r\nsmoky glass.... The felspar-lathes, ·25 to ·4 mm. in length, give\r\nlamellar extinctions of 10° to 20° (andesine) and contain a few\r\nmagma-inclusions.... The semi-ophitic augites, ·1 to ·2 mm. in size,\r\nare sometimes twinned.... The smoky glass polarises feebly and\r\ndisplays dark feathery aggregates of microliths. Within it are\r\nbrownish-yellow semi-opaque patches of residual glass, which polarise\r\nfaintly and behave like palagonite.\r\n\r\nThe two species with felspar-lathes ·2 to ·3 mm. and ·3 to ·5 mm. are\r\nrepresented in my collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n             4. GRANULAR SUB-ORDER OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, flu, gran._\r\n\r\n\r\n                               13. GENUS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, flu, gran, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes or prisms are in\r\nflow-arrangement and the augite is granular. The plagioclase phenocrysts\r\nare glassy.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—This genus readily splits up into two sub-genera, the\r\nnon-porphyritic, where the plagioclase phenocrysts are less than 3 mm.\r\nin size, and the porphyritic where they are larger.\r\n\r\n1. NON-PORPHYRITIC SUB-GENUS.—Dark-brown or blackish rocks displaying\r\nsmall plagioclase phenocrysts, usually only 1 or 2 mm. in size. Three of\r\nthe four species defined by the length of the felspar-lathes are\r\nrepresented in my collection.\r\n\r\nSPECIES A.—Felspar-lathes .02-.1 mm. in average length. This may again\r\nbe sub-divided according to the degree of basicity of the rocks:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Sub-species of greater basicity._—Sp. gr. 2·76 to 2·82.... Such\r\nrocks are represented in dykes and in the prevailing basic agglomerates.\r\nThey are at times scoriaceous. The small plagioclase phenocrysts, which\r\nare fairly numerous, give lamellar extinctions of andesine labradorite\r\n(20 to 30°). Two kinds occur which may or may not be represented in the\r\nsame slide. In the one the crystal is much corroded and contains\r\nabundant magma-inclusions. It belongs in such a case to an earlier\r\nperiod. In the other the outlines are clean and regular, and the crystal\r\nis often cross-macled to such an extent that it may be inferred from its\r\nunbroken condition to have been formed _in situ_. Augite phenocrysts\r\nwhen present are small and scanty, pale-yellow, idiomorphic, and giving\r\nextinctions of +30°. The felspar-lathes, which average ·06-·08 mm. in\r\nlength, give extinctions indicating andesine labradorite. The augite\r\ngranules are small (·01-·02 mm.). Interstitial glass, generally scanty,\r\nis sometimes abundant when it is smoky, showing fibrous devitrification,\r\nwith irregular “lacunæ” filled with a brownish yellow opaque glass like\r\npalagonite.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Sub-species of lesser basicity._—Sp. gr. 2·65-2·70.... The\r\nremarks on the plagioclase phenocrysts of the more basic sub-species\r\nhere apply, except that the lamellar extinctions indicate medium\r\nandesine (12°-20°). The characters of the augite phenocrysts and\r\ngranules are in both groups the same; but in this case there is more\r\nfrequently a suspicion of intergrowth with rhombic pyroxene. The\r\nfelspar-lathes are very small, ·04 or ·05 mm, and give simple\r\nextinctions of acid andesine (5-10°). Interstitial glass exists in\r\nmoderate amount.\r\n\r\nSPECIES B.—Felspar-lathes ·1-·2 mm. in average length.\r\n\r\nBlackish or dark-grey rather compact rocks, sp. gr. 2·75-2·79, that\r\ncannot be readily divided into groups according to their basicity. They\r\nform dykes and volcanic “necks” and are sometimes scoriaceous. The small\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts, which are most evident in the slide, present\r\nthe two kinds above described under Species A. They give lamellar\r\nextinctions varying from those of medium andesine to acid labradorite\r\n(15-30°). The augite phenocrysts, which are small and scanty,\r\noccasionally show intergrowths of rhombic pyroxene. The augite granules\r\nare generally ·02 to ·03 mm. in size, and here and there a prism form\r\ngives extinctions of +25°. The felspar-lathes which average ·11 to\r\n·15 mm. long, are often rather stout, showing a few lamellæ that give\r\nextinctions of medium and basic andesine. Interstitial glass occurs in\r\nfair amount.\r\n\r\nSPECIES C.—Felspar-lathes ·2-·3 mm. in average length.\r\n\r\nBlackish rocks with sp. gr. 2·75-2·84. The description of Species B\r\napplies here. The plagioclase phenocrysts are for the most part\r\nmicroporphyritic. The size of the augite granules is as above given.\r\n\r\n2. PORPHYRITIC SUB-GENUS.—This group of rocks is mostly confined to the\r\nslopes and vicinity of Mount Seatura in the western part of the island,\r\nbeing prevalent in the Mbua and Ndama plains, and occurring also as\r\ndyke-rocks in the Nandi Gorge leading into the Ndriti Basin, and at and\r\nnear the coasts of Wainunu Bay between the Tongalevu and Wainunu rivers.\r\nThey come near in appearance to the porphyritic forms of the blackish\r\nolivine-basalts belonging to genera 13, 25, and 37 of the olivine rocks;\r\nbut they differ in the absence of that mineral, in their lower density,\r\nand in other characters. They are the type to which the term\r\n“porphyritic basaltic andesite” is most frequently applied in the text\r\nwhen the ophitic structure is not displayed.\r\n\r\nThey are blackish rocks having a specific gravity of 2·71 to 2·81 and\r\nexhibiting large porphyritic crystals of plagioclase, but they vary in\r\ntheir minute structure on account of the different size of the felspars\r\nof the groundmass. Those forming dykes in the Nandi Gorge are often more\r\nor less propylitic in character. The felspar-lathes, which have an\r\naverage length of ·2 to ·3 mm., sometimes show a few lamellæ giving\r\nextinctions of medium andesine (12°-20°). The plagioclase phenocrysts of\r\nthe same andesine are 3 to 5 mm. in size. They are eroded and contain\r\nabundant magma inclusions. There are a few small phenocrysts of pale\r\nbrown augite. The augite granules are ·03 or ·04 mm. in diameter, and\r\nthere is a little dark opaque residual glass.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Mbua and Ndama plains have a specific gravity of 2·81.\r\nThe plagioclase phenocrysts, which yield extinctions of basic andesine\r\n(21-27°), are sometimes a centimetre in length. They are traversed by\r\ncracks filled with dark altered glass or occupied by brownish films. The\r\nfelspar-lathes, which average ·11 mm. in length, are often stout and\r\nlamellar and give extinctions like the phenocrysts. Augite phenocrysts\r\nare either absent or scanty; whilst the granules average ·02-·03 mm. in\r\nsize. There is usually a little interstitial glass.\r\n\r\nA rock, almost holocrystalline and 2·74 in density, which was obtained\r\nfrom the Tongalevu district in Wainunu Bay, approaches the orthophyric\r\ntype in the character of the ground mass. The felspars are short\r\n(·06 mm.) and stout, and yield lamellar extinctions of oligoclase\r\n(5°-10°). The plagioclase phenocrysts are of basic andesine. Amongst the\r\ngranules (·025 mm.) of pale brown augite occur prismatic forms giving\r\noblique extinctions of +30°.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   14. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, flu, gran, phen, opac_.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are in flow-arrangement\r\nand the augite is granular. The plagioclase phenocrysts are opaque.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Only two rocks are referred to this genus. One which is\r\ndark grey with a specific gravity of 2·72 is exposed in the gorge of the\r\nMbutu-mbutu River below the falls of Na Savu. Flow-arrangement is\r\ndisplayed both by the felspar phenocrysts and lathes. The phenocrysts, 2\r\nto 3 mm. in size, owe their opacity to the abundance of inclusions of\r\nbrown glass. They are corroded and give extinctions of acid labradorite\r\n(26-32°). Pyroxene phenocrysts are scanty and small. The groundmass has\r\na characteristic “pilotaxitic” appearance, the densely packed\r\nfelspar-lathes averaging only ·05 mm. in length, whilst the pyroxene\r\ngranules are ·01 mm. in size. Residual glass scanty.\r\n\r\nThe other rock is from the range behind Sueni. It shows large\r\nporphyritic crystals (5 or 6 mm.) of medium andesine which contain\r\nmagma-inclusions in abundance. The average length of the felspar-lathe\r\nis ·08 mm. and the size of the augite granules is ·02 mm. There is but\r\nlittle glass. The rock is somewhat altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   16. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, flu, gran, non-phen, parv_.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are in flow-arrangement\r\nand the augite is granular. Plagioclase phenocrysts are absent, or if\r\npresent very scanty and not usually over 1 mm. in size. When present the\r\naugite phenocrysts are under 2 mm.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—This is a very extensive genus, admitting considerable\r\nvariation and including most of the aphanitic augite-andesites, where\r\nthe felspar-lathes are as a rule very small (under ·1 mm. in length), as\r\nwell as some of the doleritic types where they are very large (·2 to\r\n·4 mm. long). In assigning a rock a place in this genus some regard must\r\nbe paid to its macroscopic aspect as well as to the presence or absence\r\nof plagioclase phenocrysts. In many cases two or three small phenocrysts\r\nmay be observed in a slide, under a millimetre in size; but they do not\r\ngive a character to the naked-eye appearance of the rock, and such rocks\r\ncannot be distinguished from others that do not display them.\r\n\r\nThese rocks range in specific gravity from 2·55 to 2·85. This large\r\nrange is in the main concerned with different degrees of basicity\r\ndepending on the character of the plagioclase, the relative abundance of\r\nthe augite granules, &c.; but it is also connected with the amount of\r\ninterstitial glass. The variety of plagioclase ranges between oligoclase\r\nand andesine labradorite. The fluidal structure is nearly always\r\nwell-marked, and the closely packed felspar-lathes have often the\r\npeculiar “felted” appearance of many andesites. A little interstitial\r\nglass is present in most rocks.\r\n\r\nMany, perhaps nearly all, of the rocks belong either to dykes or to\r\nlarger intrusive masses. All the four species indicated by the length of\r\nthe felspar-lathes are represented in my collection, especially the two\r\nwith smallest felspars. They may again be split up into two sub-species\r\naccording to the degree of basicity of the rocks.\r\n\r\nSPECIES A.—Felspar-lathes between ·02 mm. and ·1 mm. in average length.\r\n\r\n(1) _Most basic sub-species_.... Sp. gr. 2·75-2·85. Dark-brown and\r\ndark-grey compact aphanitic rocks showing no plagioclase phenocrysts to\r\nthe eye. When a few of these phenocrysts are present in a slide they are\r\nnot usually much over 1 mm. in size, and give extinctions of andesine\r\nlabradorite (20° to 30°). Augite phenocrysts are often absent, and when\r\npresent are not over 1 mm. in size and are as a rule scanty,\r\noccasionally affording a suspicion of inter-growths with rhombic\r\npyroxene. The felspar-lathes which display marked flow-structure, vary\r\nin average length in different rocks from ·05-·08 mm. Lamellar twinning\r\nis rare, the extinctions being those of oligoclase andesine (10° to\r\n20°). The usual extinction, as measured from the long axis of the lathe,\r\nis 10° to 15° (medium andesine). The augite granules are small\r\n(·01-·02 mm.) and abundant. There is generally a little interstitial\r\nglass with small magnetite.\r\n\r\n(2) _Least basic sub-species_.... Sp. gr. 2·55-2·75. Dark compact\r\naphanitic rocks especially characteristic of the Ndrawa district. When\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts are present, they are very scanty and not\r\ngenerally over a millimetre in size, possessing rectangular clean\r\noutlines and showing but few inclusions. They may display carlsbad\r\ntwinning and zoning, or albite twinning, when they give extinctions of\r\noligoclase andesine (10°-15°). Pyroxene phenocrysts are either absent,\r\nor scanty and small, being usually of pale yellow augite with occasional\r\nindications of intergrowth with rhombic pyroxene. The felspar-lathes as\r\na rule average ·07 or ·08 mm. and present a dense fluidal arrangement.\r\nThey rarely display lamellar twinning and give extinctions measured from\r\nthe long axis of oligoclase and oligoclase andesine (2°-8°). The\r\npyroxene granules are very small, averaging ·01 mm. and less. There is\r\nalso fine magnetite. A little interstitial glass is usually present.\r\nWhen abundant it is not generally smoky but shows clear fibrous\r\ndevitrification.... One of the specimens, which is semi-vitreous,\r\nexhibits tube-like steam-pores drawn out to a length of 1-1½\r\ncentimetres. The felspar microliths are only ·02 mm. in length. The\r\ncopious glass has the character above described.\r\n\r\nSPECIES B.—Felspar-lathes ·1-·2 mm. in average length.\r\n\r\nThis species may also be sub-divided into two sub-species (more basic\r\nand less basic). Since, however, all but one of the fifteen rocks\r\nbelonging to the species are of the more basic kind my remarks will\r\nmainly apply to them. They are dark-brown or dark-grey compact aphanitic\r\nrocks, occasionally banded or streaky, in appearance, and ranging in\r\nspecific gravity from 2·75 to 2·84. They occur in several districts, but\r\nare especially characteristic of the Ndrawa district. The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, if present, are very scanty and small (1 or 1½ mm.). They\r\ncontain inclusions of the magma and give lamellar extinctions of\r\nandesine labradorite (20°-30°). Pyroxene phenocrysts do not generally\r\noccur. When present, they are small and of pale yellow augite yielding\r\nlarge extinctions. Occasionally micro-porphyritic augite is well\r\nrepresented. The felspar-lathes, which exhibit a well-marked\r\nflow-arrangement, are generally ·13 to ·15 mm. long. Lamellar twinning\r\nis uncommon, the extinctions measured from the long axis indicating\r\nbasic andesine (10°-20°). The augite granules are abundant and small\r\n(·01-·02 mm.). Occasional prism-forms yield large extinctions. Magnetite\r\nis abundant, its grains corresponding in size to the augite granules.\r\nThere is as a rule a little residual glass, which shows fibrous\r\ndevitrification and is not smoky. The banded appearance of some of the\r\nrocks arises from the glass collecting in streaks rudely parallel and\r\nrunning in the direction of the “flow” of the felspar-lathes.\r\n\r\nThe only specimen in my collection of “sliced” rocks belonging to the\r\nless basic sub-species is an altered bluish-grey rock (sp. gr. 2·7) from\r\nthe range between the Mbuthai-sau valley and the Wainikoro plains. Its\r\nlong parallel untwinned felspar-lathes give the nearly straight\r\nextinctions of oligoclase. Fine cracks in the rock are filled with\r\ncrystalline silica.\r\n\r\n SPECIES C, felspar-lathes ·2-·3 mm. long.\r\n SPECIES D, felspar-lathes ·3-·5 mm. long.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of these species in the collection are for the most part\r\ndyke-rocks of the more basic kind. They are blackish or dark-brown,\r\nalmost doleritic in texture, and range in specific gravity from 2·77 to\r\n2·87. At times they are vesicular or scoriaceous, as in the specimens\r\nfrom an agglomerate at Undu Point and from a flow or dyke at Vunikondi.\r\nThe most typical of these rocks are those of some of the dykes of the\r\nNdriti basin, which, however, display propylitic alteration in a varying\r\ndegree. They would be described as semi-doleritic basalts without\r\nolivine or as non-porphyritic basaltic andesites. Plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts are typically absent, or they are scanty and not over 1 mm.\r\nin size. Augite phenocrysts are usually scanty and small. The\r\nfelspar-lathes, which are more or less in flow-arrangement, are rather\r\nstout, and range in average length in different rocks from ·23 to\r\n·35 mm. They often show a few twin-lamellæ which yield extinctions of\r\nmedium and basic andesine (15-28°). The augite granules are large\r\n(·03 mm.) in the Ndriti rocks. Magnetites, usually corresponding in size\r\nto the augite granules, are abundant. Interstitial glass occurs often in\r\nfair quantity and is dark and semi-opaque.\r\n\r\nAt times there can be recognised a later generation of minute felspar\r\nmicroliths between the much larger lathes. They display a plexus rather\r\nthan a flow-arrangement. Whilst the larger parallel lathes of the\r\nVunikondi rock, above referred to, average ·23 mm. long, the felspar\r\nmicroliths of the interspaces average only ·03 mm. The significance of\r\nthese two crops of felspars in the groundmass is discussed on page 237.\r\n\r\nThe only rock of the less basic sub-species in my collection is from a\r\ndyke near Vatua-karoa. It shows secondary calcite and viridite and other\r\nevidences of the propylitic change. The felspar-lathes, which average\r\n·3 mm. in length, give extinctions of oligoclase (0-5°). The specific\r\ngravity is 2·72.\r\n\r\n\r\n            5. SUB-ORDER, PRISMATIC, OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\n(Felspar-lathes in flow-arrangement. _Aug, matr, flu, prism_.)\r\n\r\nThis sub-order includes dark-brown or blackish semi-vitreous rocks, all\r\nbut one of which belong to the genus below described. Since the\r\nexception (which belongs to genus 17 of the synopsis) differs only in\r\nthe presence of plagioclase phenocrysts, its separate description is not\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   20. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, flu, prism, non-phen, parv._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are in\r\nflow-arrangement, and the augite is prismatic. Plagioclase phenocrysts\r\nare absent or are very small and scanty, and pyroxene phenocrysts when\r\npresent do not exceed 2 mm. in size.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—These dark semi-vitreous rocks occur in agglomerates and as\r\n“necks” and dykes, and are at times scoriaceous. They are usually\r\ncompact and aphanitic, showing few if any plagioclase phenocrysts and\r\nhaving a semi-conchoidal fracture. The specific gravity varies, being\r\ngenerally 2·6-2·65, but according to the degree of basicity and amount\r\nof glass it may be as low as 2·5 or as high as 2·77. In the less glassy\r\ncondition, as in the case of a rock from the ridge east of Na Raro, the\r\nfelspar-lathes are relatively scanty and the groundmass is mainly formed\r\nof augite prisms in flow-arrangement. The lathes are generally small,\r\nless than ·1 mm., and rarely over ·2 mm. Their extinctions are those of\r\noligoclase and acid andesine. The pyroxene prisms, which give the large\r\nextinctions of augite, have a pale muddy-brown hue and are as a rule\r\n·03-·07 mm. long. Granular pyroxene, if present, is subordinate in\r\namount. The glass, which is always in good quantity and is sometimes\r\nabundant, displays fibrous devitrification. In a rock from the vicinity\r\nof Narengali a variolitic structure is exhibited in the form of\r\nsheaf-like aggregates of fibre-like felspars and skeleton prisms of\r\npyroxene.\r\n\r\n\r\n             6. SUB-ORDER, OPHITIC, OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\n(Felspar-lathes in flow-arrangement. _Aug, matr, flu, oph._)\r\n\r\n21. GENUS OF THE AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Aug, matr, flu, oph, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—In the groundmass the felspar-lathes are in flow-arrangement\r\nand the augite is ophitic or semi-ophitic. Glassy plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—Dark rocks, sp. gr. 2·76-2·8, forming ancient flows and\r\ndisplaying at times a columnar structure as at Yanutha Point (page 123).\r\nThe ophitic character is only in part developed, which may be connected\r\nwith the flow-arrangement of the felspars. These rocks come near to the\r\nblackish ophitic basalts with scanty olivine (genus 33 of the olivine\r\nsub-class).\r\n\r\nThey all belong to the non-porphyritic sub-genus where the plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts are less than 3 mm. in size. These phenocrysts, which often\r\ncontain abundant magma-inclusions, give extinctions of andesine\r\nlabradorite (20°-30°). The augite phenocrysts are small and composite in\r\ncharacter as often happens with these ophitic rocks. They sometimes\r\ninvest the smallest felspar phenocrysts, and occasionally display\r\nintergrowths of rhombic pyroxene. The felspar lathes are ·1 to ·14 mm.\r\nin length, and give extinctions of medium and basic andesine. The augite\r\ngranules are large (·02-·06 mm.), and tend to wrap around the lathes.\r\nInterstitial glass exists in fair amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n             THE VOLCANIC ROCKS OF VANUA LEVU (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HYPERSTHENE-AUGITE CLASS\r\n\r\n              II. SUB-CLASS. HYPERSTHENE-AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Plag, hypersth-aug, matr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—The pyroxene phenocrysts usually are represented by separate\r\ncrystals of the monoclinic as well as the rhombic type, and the two\r\nforms are often associated in the same crystal. The monoclinic form\r\nprevails in the groundmass in most cases.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.—It is not possible to draw a sharp line between the augite and\r\nthe hypersthene-augite-andesites; but where two or three phenocrysts of\r\nthe rhombic type occur in a slide the rock may be placed in this\r\ndivision. Between this variety and that where rhombic pyroxene prevails,\r\nboth among the phenocrysts and in the groundmass, numerous intermediate\r\nkinds exist. These rocks mostly occur in agglomerates and form small and\r\nlarge dykes or sills, but rarely are found in flows. They are\r\ndistributed over most of the island except in the western portion (the\r\nbasaltic districts of Wainunu, Seatura, and Solevu), but reappear again\r\nin the Mbua peninsula in places, as at Mount Koroma.\r\n\r\nThe pale yellow rhombic pyroxene is uniform in its optical behaviour.\r\nThe prisms are noticeably pleochroic, being nearly colourless when lying\r\nacross the long axis of the lower nicol and pale yellow when parallel\r\nwith it. The intergrowths with monoclinic pyroxene often take the form\r\nof lamellar bands, whilst in some cases a nucleus of the one (usually\r\nrhombic) is invested by a growth of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n       1 SUB-ORDER, GRANULAR, OF THE HYPERSTHENE-AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\n              (_Felspar-lathes not in flow-arrangement._)\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Hypersth-aug, matr, non-flu, gran._\r\n\r\n 1 genus        (_Vitr._) }\r\n 2   \"          (_Opac._) } See Synopsis, p. 247.\r\n 3   \"          (_Magn._) }\r\n 4   \"          (_Parv._) }\r\n\r\nNearly all of the rocks of this sub-order that are represented in my\r\ncollection belong to the genus (1) with phenocrysts of glassy\r\nplagioclase. They vary considerably in appearance and in colour (black\r\nto grey), and occur under very different conditions, as in “necks,” old\r\nflows, large intrusive masses, dykes, agglomerates, &c. Their specific\r\ngravity has rather a wide range according to the degree of basicity. In\r\nthe heavier rocks where the rhombic pyroxene is scanty, it is usually\r\n2·7 to 2·8. In the others, where rhombic pyroxene is more predominant\r\nand where the felspar is less basic, it is 2·6 to 2·7.\r\n\r\nIn the slide small phenocrysts of plagioclase and pyroxene occur in a\r\ngroundmass of felspar-lathes and pyroxene granules, whilst there is as a\r\nrule a fair amount of residual glass. The plagioclase phenocrysts, which\r\ngive extinctions in different rocks of acid and basic andesine and\r\ncontain abundant magma-inclusions, are generally one to two mm. in size.\r\nThe pyroxene phenocrysts are small, and may be represented by separate\r\ncrystals of the monoclinic and rhombic kinds, or by crystals displaying\r\nintergrowths of the two sorts. The pyroxene granules vary much in size\r\nand are evidently in great part of augite. In most of the rocks the\r\nfelspar-lathes are less than ·1 mm. in length. In those where the length\r\nis ·1 to ·2 mm. they are sometimes stout and display a few lamellæ,\r\nyielding extinctions corresponding to those of the phenocrysts.\r\n\r\nA singular dark grey almost holocrystalline doleritic rock (sp. gr.\r\n2·85) is exposed in the Thulanga Ridge (p. 211). It shows no plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts, but those of pyroxene are numerous, which, however, do not\r\nexceed 2 mm. in size, so that the rock would be referred to genus 4 of\r\nthis sub-order. It appears to be a doleritic form of the plutonic rock\r\nfound at Nawi in this neighbourhood (p. 211). The pyroxene phenocrysts\r\nare mostly of brownish-yellow augite, but rhombic pyroxene, either as\r\nseparate crystals or as intergrowths, is not uncommon. The plagioclase\r\nlathes are long and fairly stout, giving at times lamellar extinctions\r\nof 20°. Their average length is ·3 mm., and it is to their large size\r\nthat the doleritic texture is due. The pyroxenes of the groundmass are\r\nsimilarly coarse (·2 mm.), and include both monoclinic and rhombic\r\nforms, the latter infrequent. There is a slight tendency to semi-ophitic\r\nbehaviour in places; but generally these pyroxenes are irregular in\r\nshape or rudely prismatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n      2.

They belong to the\r\ntwo genera, with glassy and opaque plagioclase phenocrysts. These\r\ncrystals are not usually over 2 mm. in size and are of medium andesine\r\n(15°-20°). The pyroxene phenocrysts are small and may be entirely of\r\nmonoclinic or of rhombic pyroxene, or the two may be associated either\r\nas lamellar intergrowths, or by displaying an eroded nucleus (generally\r\nrhombic) around which a regular crystal of monoclinic pyroxene has\r\ngrown. The felspar-lathes are in some cases less than ·1 mm. long, and\r\nin others ·1-·2 mm. The pyroxene prisms of the groundmass average\r\n·01-·04 mm. in length, and give both straight and oblique extinctions,\r\nthe last prevailing.

GENUS\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Hypersth-aug, matr, flu, gran, phen, vitr._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Glassy plagioclase phenocrysts.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.—This is a group of rocks that comes near the basaltic\r\nandesites represented in genera 1 and 13 of the augite sub-class; and to\r\nthe more basic kinds the terms of basaltic andesite is equally\r\napplicable. These rocks, however, differ in the prevalence of rhombic\r\npyroxene, which occurs as phenocrysts, but always accompanied by\r\nmonoclinic pyroxene, whether as separate crystals or as inter-growths.\r\nSuch rocks are intermediate between those of the augite and rhombic\r\npyroxene classes. They are particularly characteristic of the Savu-savu\r\npeninsula, but they are also found in other scattered localities.\r\nSometimes they appear to form ancient flows, and at other times\r\nintrusive masses and dykes; but they are rarely scoriaceous.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the rocks in my collection referred to this genus belong to\r\nthe species where the felspar-lathes of the groundmass are ·02-·1 mm.\r\nlong. They are generally blackish or dark-brown, and the specific\r\ngravity ranges usually from 2·72 to 2·83. They display in the slide a\r\nfair number of plagioclase and pyroxene phenocrysts in a groundmass of\r\nfelspar-lathes, pyroxene granules, and magnetite, the interstitial glass\r\nbeing scanty or moderate in amount.... The plagioclase phenocrysts are\r\nrarely as large as 3 mm., so that most of the rocks belong to the\r\nnon-porphyritic group of the genus. These phenocrysts, which are often\r\nzoned, give extinctions of basic andesine (15°-25°). They contain\r\nmagma-inclusions, sometimes in abundance, which are arranged in\r\nzone-lines.... The pyroxene phenocrysts are small, the two kinds being\r\nalways represented in the same slide. In some cases separate crystals\r\noccur, and in others the two are associated as intergrowths, but in most\r\ncases separate and compound crystals occur in the same section. Not\r\ninfrequently the phenocryst is an aggregate of lesser crystals of the\r\ntwo pyroxenes. The monoclinic form is a brownish yellow augite with\r\nlarge extinctions and often twinned. The felspar-lathes of the\r\ngroundmass, which usually average ·05 or ·06 mm. in length, are either\r\nnarrow and untwinned, or they may be stouter and display simple and at\r\ntimes lamellar twinning, giving extinctions of medium andesine.... The\r\ngranules of pyroxene are generally ·01-·02 mm. in size; but occasional\r\nprism-forms occur which give sometimes the straight extinction of\r\nrhombic pyroxene and at other times the large oblique extinctions of the\r\naugite type.\r\n\r\n\r\n      5.

The\r\nexception refers to a low mound-like hill, apparently a “volcanic neck,”\r\nthat rises from the basaltic plains west of Mbua (see page 58).\r\n\r\nIn about half of the specimens the rocks are referred to section 10,\r\nwhere the plagioclase phenocrysts are either small and very scanty or\r\nare absent altogether. In a fair number these phenocrysts are opaque\r\n(genus 18); whilst in a few they are glassy (genus 17). The rocks are\r\ntypically blackish or dark grey, and often have a pitchstone-like\r\nappearance, the groundmass being frequently semi-vitreous in character.\r\nVesicular and scoriaceous rocks occur at times.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the felspar-lathes and pyroxene prisms are more or less in\r\nflow-arrangement; whilst pyroxene granules, if present, are subordinate.\r\nThe felspar-lathes, which are either simple or once-twinned and give\r\nextinctions of acid and medium andesine, are usually small, and average\r\nin different sections ·05-·08 mm. in length. The pyroxene prisms are\r\npale brown and are ·03 or ·04 mm. long. Most of them give oblique\r\nextinctions of over 25; but in the same slide some give straight\r\nextinctions; the proportion varies in different rocks. The pyroxene\r\nphenocrysts in all the specimens are small (not over 2 mm.), and are\r\nrhombic and monoclinic. In most sections the two forms are represented\r\nby separate crystals and are also associated in the same phenocryst.\r\nThose of rhombic pyroxene have often dark borders. There is a\r\nconsiderable amount of a pale brown glass in the groundmass, more or\r\nless devitrified. The specific gravity varies considerably, but is as a\r\nrule between 2·55 and 2·75, the more basic rocks containing augite in\r\npreponderance and basic andesine, whilst the less basic possess a large\r\nproportion of rhombic pyroxene and display oligoclase-andesine.\r\nSometimes, as in the case of a rock composing an agglomerate east of\r\nNanduri, where the porphyritic plagioclase is opaque and there is some\r\ndegree of alteration, the rock looks very like a porphyrite.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THIRD ORDER, ORTHOPHYRIC, OF THE HYPERSTHENE-AUGITE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Hypersth-aug, matr, orth._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—Felspars of the groundmass short and broad.\r\n\r\nSince the material is insufficient for the separate description of each\r\ngenus, a general account of the order is alone given. These rocks are\r\noften represented in agglomerates or they occur as large blocks, either\r\nlying on the surface or imbedded in tuffs. Many of them are somewhat\r\naltered.\r\n\r\nThey are for the most part dark grey dull-looking rocks, with a specific\r\ngravity of 2·7 to 2·8, showing macroscopic plagioclase together with\r\nconspicuous pyroxene phenocrysts. The plagioclase phenocrysts are\r\nusually small (1 to 3 mm.), and give extinctions of medium andesine\r\n(15°-20°) and in some rocks of acid labradorite (30°). They are as a\r\nrule corroded and are penetrated by numerous fissures, whilst they\r\ncontain a considerable amount of altered magma-inclusions with sometimes\r\nother alteration products. The pyroxene phenocrysts are from 2 to 4 mm.\r\nin size. Brownish-yellow augite, giving extinctions of over 30°, and\r\npale-yellow rhombic pyroxene of the type before described occur\r\ngenerally in the same slide, and are frequently associated as\r\nintergrowths in the same crystal. They may have regular outlines or dark\r\neroded borders, and at times they exhibit abundant dark opaque\r\ninclusions. The broad felspars of the groundmass are sometimes\r\nrectangular and give lamellar extinctions of medium and acid andesine\r\n(12°-17°). They vary in length in different rocks from ·05 to ·2 mm. and\r\nmore. The pyroxene of the groundmass is generally granular and coarse\r\n(·02-·05 mm.). As indicated by the extinctions of occasional prism-forms\r\nit is composed of both augite and rhombic pyroxene, the former\r\nprevailing. The prismatic sub-order is also represented, and here the\r\npyroxene of the groundmass is in great part prismatic, the length of the\r\nprisms not often exceeding ·05 mm., whilst both the monoclinic and\r\nrhombic kinds occur. Interstitial glass varies in amount, sometimes\r\nabsent, sometimes scanty and viriditic, at other times abundant and\r\nopaque. Magnetite abounds in the groundmass much of it often being of\r\nsecondary origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n      FOURTH ORDER, FELSITIC, OF THE HYPERSTHENE-AUGITE ANDESITES\r\n\r\nFORMULA.—_Hypersth-aug, matr, fels._\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS.—The groundmass presents a rudely granular appearance or a\r\nblurred mosaic.\r\n\r\nThis order is capable of subdivision, as in the other orders of the\r\nhypersthene-augite-andesites (see Synopsis, page 247); but since it is\r\nonly represented by six of my rock-sections, I will confine the\r\ndescription to the general characters.\r\n\r\nThese rocks are dark-grey, sometimes granitoid in appearance, with\r\nspecific gravity 2·65 to 2·75. They usually show some alteration,\r\narising from secondary changes within the rock-mass; and probably the\r\nfelsitic or semi-mosaic appearance of the scanty groundmass is the\r\nresult of such a secondary change. Such rocks in some respects approach\r\nthe type of the gabbros. They are frequent on the north coast of Natewa\r\nBay in the vicinity of Waimotu and also occur in the Valanga Ridge. They\r\ngenerally present themselves as deeper-seated massive rocks exposed by\r\nthe stripping off of the superficial deposits.\r\n\r\nThere are as a rule more or less conspicuous phenocrysts, up to 3 mm. in\r\nsize, of plagioclase and pyroxene, in a relatively scanty micro-felsitic\r\ngroundmass, displaying a blurred mosaic, in which a few stout\r\nfelspar-lathes can still be recognised, and composed apparently of\r\nfelspar and crystalline silica. The “grain” of the mosaic may range in\r\ndifferent rocks from ·005 mm. to ·02 mm. The pyroxene of the groundmass\r\nis largely decomposed, and the scanty residual glass is represented by\r\nviriditic materials.\r\n\r\nThe plagioclase phenocrysts, which give extinctions of medium and basic\r\nandesine (15°-25°), are often semi-opaque and corroded. They are\r\ntraversed by numerous cracks and often contain many whitish alteration\r\nproducts, though the lamellar structure is usually well preserved. The\r\npyroxene phenocrysts are composed of brownish-yellow augite (ext. + 30°)\r\nand pale rhombic pyroxene of the type described before, either as\r\nseparate crystals or associated as intergrowths. The rhombic pyroxene\r\ncrystals are often sub-rounded with dark borders; and as a rule the\r\npyroxene phenocrysts are much fresher than the plagioclase phenocrysts.\r\nAs far as can be ascertained, most of the original pyroxene of the\r\ngroundmass was monoclinic with a little rhombic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n             THE VOLCANIC ROCKS OF VANUA LEVU (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ACID ANDESITES\r\n\r\n      _Previous observations on the Hornblende-Andesites of Fiji_\r\n\r\nTHESE rocks were first described by Wichmann[112] from specimens\r\nobtained by Kleinschmidt from the mountain of Mbuke Levu in Kandavu.\r\nThese Kandavu rocks had a microfelsitic base, the porphyritic brown\r\nhornblende having usually black borders in which a change into epidote\r\nwas observed. Rhombic pyroxene was only noted as an occasional\r\nconstituent of a rock from Ono. Renard[113] described these rocks from\r\nthe vicinity of Ngaloa Harbour in Kandavu and remarked that bronzite was\r\nof more common occurrence than the monoclinic pyroxene. In the\r\ngroundmass were numerous felspar and augite microliths, whilst there was\r\na porphyritic development of plagioclase, hornblende, biotite, and\r\npyroxene. The hornblende phenocrysts played an important part in the\r\nrock-composition, being surrounded by a black zone of magnetite or\r\nbordered by a bacillary aggregate of small pyroxene prisms, parallel and\r\ncolourless or greenish, with extinction-angles of 40°. There was often\r\nalso a development of biotite in the heart of the mineral, the whole\r\nhornblende section being sometimes thus transformed.\r\n\r\nMr. Eakle[114] has more recently described the hornblende-andesites from\r\nMbuke Levu in Kandavu. As the result of his examination of a collection\r\nof volcanic rocks made by the Agassiz expedition in Viti Levu, Kandavu,\r\nMbenga, Totoya, Malolo, Yasawa group, and in several other small\r\nislands, he inferred that the hornblende-andesites are much more limited\r\nin their occurrence in Fiji than the augite-andesites; whilst\r\nhypersthene-andesite was only represented in the collection from\r\nVomo-lailai near Waia in the Yasawas. The specimens from Waia had a\r\nmicrofelsitic base with pseudomorphs of hornblende and some augite. Mr.\r\nE. C. Andrews[115] in his account of his collection of volcanic rocks,\r\nmade mostly in the Lau Group and Taviuni, makes no special reference to\r\nhornblende-andesites, the andesites being mainly augitic, rhombic\r\npyroxene also occurring as a common porphyritic constituent.\r\n\r\nIt may be inferred from the above and from my own observations in Vanua\r\nLevu below given that hornblende-andesites have a relatively limited\r\ndistribution in Fiji. They are not generally distributed as in the case\r\nof the augitic and basaltic andesites; but are confined to certain\r\nlocalities in Viti Levu,[116] Vanua Levu, Ovalau, Kandavu, Ono, Malolo,\r\nYasawa Islands, etc.\r\n\r\n_The occurrence of quartz-andesites or dacites in Fiji._—In connection\r\nwith the existence of these rocks in Vanua Levu, it is noteworthy that\r\nexcept in Mr. Eakle’s paper there is no reference in any of these\r\nwritings to the occurrence of quartz-andesites in Fiji. Wichmann\r\nexpressly states that the rocks he examined were free from quartz, and\r\nthat up to his time (1882) no quartz-bearing younger eruptive rocks were\r\nknown from the South Seas. Mr. Eakle in 1899 described a\r\nholo-crystalline andesite with a felsitic aspect from Malolo and another\r\nsimilar looking rock from Vatu Mbulo, in the same sub-group of the\r\nFijian Islands, showing quartz both in the phenocrysts and in the\r\nmicrocrystalline groundmass, concerning which he observed that it was\r\nperhaps more of a dacite than an andesite. Dacites were found by me in\r\n1884 in the island of Fauro in the Solomon group,[117] and it is\r\nprobable that they are of more frequent occurrence in the Pacific than\r\nhas been generally supposed. As shown immediately below, they are\r\nrepresented in Vanua Levu; and the extent of their distribution in the\r\nisland depends on the limits we assign to the definition of the term\r\n“dacite.”\r\n\r\nIf we restrict the term to a hornblende-andesite carrying porphyritic\r\nquartz and displaying a microfelsitic groundmass, such rocks, though\r\nthey form some of the highest peaks in the Ndrandramea district, namely\r\nNgaingai and Wawa-levu, would not be very frequent in Vanua Levu. If,\r\nhowever, a microfelsitic groundmass is alone necessary to constitute a\r\n“dacite,” the great majority of the acid andesites of the island would\r\nfall under this designation.[118] This has long been a controverted\r\npoint in petrology. If I adopted the last procedure, my general\r\nclassification for the andesites would fall into confusion and many\r\nrocks without any quartz would be included in the dacites.\r\n\r\nIn the Synopsis it will be seen that my classification of the\r\nandesites is as far as concerns the great groups based on\r\nthe mineral and not on the structural characters. There\r\nare three sub-classes closely allied to each other, the\r\nhypersthene-andesites, the hornblende-hypersthene-andesites, and the\r\nquartz-hornblende-hypersthene-andesites or dacites, which cannot be\r\ndistinguished at their boundaries by their petrological characters or by\r\ntheir different modes of occurrence. These groups of rocks which include\r\nall the acid andesites of the island will now be dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE ACID-ANDESITES OF VANUA LEVU\r\n\r\n                (_Comprising the hypersthene-andesites;\r\n                   hornblende-hypersthene-andesites;\r\n        and quartz-hornblende-hypersthene-andesites or dacites_)\r\n\r\nThese rocks compose in mass numerous isolated hills that rise up\r\nabruptly in the interior of the central portion of the island. Such\r\nhills, or mountains, as they might be often termed, usually attain a\r\nheight of from 700 to 1200 feet above the surrounding country, and\r\npossess precipitous slopes and frequently perpendicular cliff-faces. In\r\nthe geological description of the island, I have referred in detail to\r\nthese mountains, when speaking of Na Raro, Vatu Kaisia, Ndrandramea,\r\nNgaingai, etc.; and illustrations of some of them are included in this\r\nwork. It may, however, be here remarked that they are as a rule rudely\r\nconical with rounded or peaked summits. The ground-plan is generally\r\nelliptical in outline; and in consequence the profile often varies from\r\ndifferent points of view, so that as in the case of Na Raro, it is that\r\nof a sharp conical peak when the mountain is viewed “end-on,” or of a\r\nbroad truncated mass when seen from the side. A similar change of form\r\nis to be noticed in the illustrations of Ndrandramea. No traces of\r\ncrateral cavities came under my notice. The rocks are neither vesicular\r\nnor scoriaceous, and are usually massive; but exhibit at times a rudely\r\ncolumnar structure.\r\n\r\nEach hill or mountain has its peculiar variety of these rocks. This is\r\nwell shown in the Ndrandramea district. Thus the rocks of Ngaingai and\r\nof Wawa-levu in carrying porphyritic quartz differ from those of all the\r\nother hills around. Those of Soloa Levu are distinguished by the\r\northophyric groundmass and by the absence of hornblende. Those of Mount\r\nNdrandramea again have no porphyritic quartz, but little hornblende, and\r\npossess a micro-felsitic groundmass. The rocks of Na Raro and Vatu\r\nKaisia differ as regards specific gravity, the “grain” of the felsitic\r\ngroundmass, the presence of phenocrysts of rhombic pyroxene, etc. The\r\ncharacters of these rocks from various localities are contrasted in the\r\ntable given on a later page, whilst the different sub-classes to which\r\nthey belong are described in detail below.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SUB-CLASS HYPERSTHENE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nThese are dark and light grey rocks, sometimes granitoid in appearance.\r\nThey pass on the one hand into the hypersthene-augite-andesites before\r\ndescribed and on the other into the hornblende hypersthene-andesites to\r\nbe subsequently dealt with. From the former they are distinguished by\r\nthe great predominance of rhombic pyroxene both as phenocrysts and in\r\nthe groundmass; whilst from the latter they are separated by the absence\r\nof brown hornblende or its pseudomorphs. These rocks are found in the\r\nNdrandramea, Valanga, and Vunimbua districts. They may form isolated\r\ndome-shaped hills as in that of Soloa Levu, or they may constitute the\r\ndeeper-seated rocks of the region from which these hills arise,\r\nas in the Ndrandramea district. In their general mode of\r\noccurrence, however, they cannot be treated apart from the allied\r\nhornblende-hypersthene-andesites and the dacites.\r\n\r\nThis sub-class may be divided like the hypersthene-augite-andesites into\r\nfour orders according to the character of the groundmass; and these are\r\nenumerated in the Synopsis. Only the orthophyric and felsitic orders are\r\nrepresented in my collection. Of the former the most typical rocks are\r\nthose composing the hill of Soloa Levu which is described on page 103.\r\n\r\nThese Soloa Levu rocks are lightish grey and granitoid in aspect, with\r\nspecific gravity of 2·54-2·62, and displaying abundant porphyritic\r\ncrystals of pyroxene, 2-3 mm. in size. In the slides they show a large\r\nnumber of plagioclase phenocrysts together with those of pyroxene in a\r\nrelatively scanty groundmass, for the most part orthophyric in texture\r\nand without residual glass.... The plagioclase phenocrysts, which are\r\nnot usually over 2 or 3 mm. in size, are often tabular and show distinct\r\nzone-lines. Though they are traversed by minute cracks and have\r\nfrequently a semi-saussuritic appearance arising partly from\r\nchange-products and partly from the abundance of colourless inclusions,\r\nthey yield clear lamellar extinctions of medium and basic andesine\r\n(15°-25°).... The pyroxene phenocrysts, which are not much altered, are\r\nin most cases long pale-yellow rhombic prisms with rounded ends,\r\nbehaving optically as described on page 285; but intergrowths with\r\nmonoclinic pyroxene may occur and even separate crystals of augite....\r\nThe scanty groundmass, though in the main formed of short and broad\r\nfelspars, ·12 mm. long, of the orthophyric type, displays in places a\r\nrude mosaic, apparently of quartz and felspar. It also shows abundant\r\nsmall pyroxenes in the form of small prisms (·05 mm. in length), giving\r\nextinctions nearly always straight but occasionally oblique (30°-35°).\r\n\r\nAs examples of the felsitic order of these rocks, most of which are\r\naltered like the propylites, I will first take the case of those\r\ndeep-seated rocks that are exposed in the river-bed above Nambuna in the\r\nNdrandramea district. In the least altered state they are dark grey and\r\nmottled, and have a specific gravity of 2·66-2·69. In section they\r\ndisplay tabular zoned plagioclase phenocrysts, usually more or less\r\noccupied by alteration products, but at times giving lamellar\r\nextinctions of basic andesine (20°-25°). The rhombic pyroxene is more or\r\nless replaced by chloritoid pseudomorphs; whilst the “grain” of the\r\nmosaic is often coarse (·03 mm.), and much of it is evidently quartz.\r\nThe more advanced stages of alteration of these rocks are described in\r\nthe account of the district given on page 106.... Similar rocks, showing\r\npyrites, occur amongst the blocks of Vunimbua River; but here the\r\nrhombic pyroxene is mostly converted into bastite, and the groundmass is\r\nin part trachytic as well as felsitic in texture. The specific gravity\r\nis 2·7.\r\n\r\n(In the last survey of my collection I have found a solitary specimen\r\nfrom an agglomerate in the Mbua-Lekutu “divide,” which must be referred\r\nto the order with felspar-lathes in flow-arrangement. It is a pale grey\r\nrock showing abundant macroscopic pyroxene prisms, 2 mm. long, mostly\r\nrhombic but showing also intergrowths with monoclinic pyroxene. The\r\nfelspar-lathes do not average more than ·1 mm., and there is a quantity\r\nof small prisms of rhombic pyroxene in the groundmass, which also\r\ncontains a little residual glass.)\r\n\r\n\r\n               SUB-CLASS HORNBLENDE-HYPERSTHENE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\nThis is an extensive group which includes the rocks forming several of\r\nthe hills in the Ndrandramea district as well as the isolated peaks of\r\nNa Raro, Vatu Kaisia, etc. It passes on the one side into the\r\nHypersthene-Andesites before described and on the other into the\r\nHornblende-Hypersthene-Quartz-Andesites, the Dacites of this island.\r\n\r\nOf the four orders established in the Synopsis (page 236) according to\r\nthe general method there adopted, the first, where the groundmass\r\nexhibits felspar-lathes not in flow-arrangement, is not represented in\r\nmy collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n          SECOND ORDER OF THE HORNBLENDE-HYPERSTHENE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\n                 (_Felspar-lathes in flow-arrangement_)\r\n\r\nThis order is only represented by three rocks, all of which belong to\r\nthe prismatic sub-order where the pyroxene of the groundmass is\r\nprismatic and not granular.\r\n\r\nTwo of these rocks are very similar in appearance and character, though\r\ncoming from different localities on the opposite sides of Savu-savu Bay,\r\none from the agglomerate of Vatu-ndamu in the Kumbulau peninsula (page\r\n91), the other from an intrusive mass in the vicinity of Urata (page\r\n184). They are dark grey, with specific gravity 2·6 to 2·7, and display\r\nmacroscopic crystals of hornblende and pyroxene. In the slide they\r\nexhibit in addition numerous phenocrysts of plagioclase, 1 to 2 mm. in\r\nsize, in a groundmass showing small felspar-lathes (less than ·1 mm. in\r\nlength) in partial flow-arrangement and numerous pyroxene prisms\r\n(·05 mm. long) giving straight extinctions, together with a little\r\nresidual glass.... The plagioclase phenocrysts, which give extinctions\r\nof medium and basic andesine, are often tabular and display zone-lines.\r\nThey contain abundant pale inclusions arranged zone-wise.... The\r\nhornblende phenocrysts are dark brown, markedly pleochroic, and give\r\nextinctions up to 12 degrees. They have dark resorption borders and are\r\nsometimes deeply corroded. They show in various stages the remarkable\r\nconversion at the borders into fine pyroxene, which is described on page\r\n306.... The pyroxene phenocrysts are more numerous in the Urata rock.\r\nThey are for the most part of the pale yellow feebly pleochroic rhombic\r\ntype that prevails in the island. A few phenocrysts of pale augite (ext.\r\n35°) may occur in the same slide; whilst the two pyroxenes may be\r\nassociated as intergrowths.\r\n\r\nA crypto-crystalline variety of these rocks, where the felspar-lathes\r\nand rhombic pyroxene prisms of the groundmass are only in part\r\ndifferentiated, is found on the hills of Ndreke-ni-wai on the shores of\r\nNatewa Bay (page 201). It is a pale-grey open-textured rock, displaying\r\nnumerous small macroscopic crystals of hornblende.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THIRD ORDER OF THE HORNBLENDE-HYPERSTHENE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\n (_Felspars of the groundmass, short and broad, of the orthophyric type_)\r\n\r\nThese rocks occur generally as agglomerates and are more particularly\r\ncharacteristic of the district between the Mariko Range and the Salt\r\nLake. They belong for the most part to the prismatic sub-order of the\r\ngroup and to the section with plagioclase phenocrysts, and fall\r\nnaturally into two divisions corresponding to the two genera with\r\n_glassy_ and _opaque_ phenocrysts. The last named would be regarded by\r\nsome as porphyrites. The specific gravity of the specimens ranges from\r\n2·52 to 2·7.\r\n\r\nThe plagioclase phenocrysts, 1 to 2 mm. in size, give extinctions\r\nindicating in some rocks oligoclase-andesine (10°-15°) and in others\r\nbasic andesine (15°-25°). Their opacity in the porphyrites is sometimes\r\ndue to multiple macling, but more usually it arises from the numerous\r\nfine cracks filled with decomposition products that traverse them. The\r\nphenocrysts of dark brown hornblende are generally abundant and give\r\nextinctions of 15 degrees. They as a rule have dark resorption borders\r\nin which the process of conversion into fine pyroxene is in active\r\noperation. The pyroxene phenocrysts are scanty and in most cases\r\nrhombic; but intergrowths with augite and separate crystals of the\r\nlast-named may occur. In the altered rocks or porphyrites they are\r\nlargely replaced by bastite and viridite. The felspars of the groundmass\r\nare broad and often rectangular and may give lamellar extinctions of\r\noligoclase-andesine. The pyroxene in the groundmass of the porphyrites\r\nis often partly decomposed. It is as a rule prismatic. A little\r\ninterstitial glass, altered in the porphyrites, is generally present.\r\n\r\n\r\n          FOURTH ORDER OF THE HORNBLENDE-HYPERSTHENE-ANDESITES\r\n\r\n    (_Groundmass felsitic, displaying a granular mosaic structure_)\r\n\r\nThese are light and dark grey rocks showing usually macroscopic pyroxene\r\nand hornblende. They vary considerably in appearance from the\r\nopen-textured rock to that with a granitoid coarsely crystalline aspect.\r\nThey generally carry brown hornblende phenocrysts, but frequently these\r\nare represented by pseudomorphs; and they all have a felsitic\r\ngroundmass. They are only separated by the absence of porphyritic quartz\r\nfrom the dacites of Vanua Levu, which are treated in the next sub-class.\r\nThey present all stages from the crypto-crystalline to the\r\nholo-crystalline condition, but all show a groundmass which may be\r\nscanty in the more coarsely crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nThese rocks are characteristic of some of the hills of the Ndrandramea\r\ndistrict and of the isolated peaks of Vatu Kaisia and Na Raro. They\r\ninclude a large proportion of the acid andesites of the island, and all\r\nbelong to the prismatic sub-order with prismatic pyroxene in the\r\ngroundmass, and to the section with plagioclase phenocrysts. Their\r\nspecific gravity ranges usually from 2·55 in the more acid and less\r\ncrystalline types to 2·74 in the most crystalline and basic kinds.\r\n\r\nIn the typical slides they display phenocrysts of plagioclase, pyroxene,\r\nand brown hornblende in a microfelsitic groundmass formed evidently of\r\nfelspar and quartz together with much prismatic pyroxene. They may be\r\nconveniently divided into three species according to the size of the\r\n“grain” of the groundmass.\r\n\r\nOf the first species, where the “grain” is less than ·01 mm., the rocks\r\nof Mount Ndrandramea are typical. They have a crypto-crystalline\r\ngroundmass where the felsitic structure is in process of development and\r\nwhere the pyroxene prisms or microliths are very minute. The plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts (1 mm. in size) give extinctions of acid and medium andesine\r\n(10°-20°), and are tabular, zoned, and contain abundant pale inclusions.\r\nThe hornblende phenocrysts, except in the case of the rocks at the foot\r\nof the hill, are represented by pseudomorphs in various stages of\r\ndispersion, so that this character is likely to be overlooked. The\r\npyroxene phenocrysts are in most cases of the pale yellow feebly\r\npleochroic rhombic type, but they may present intergrowths of both the\r\nmonoclinic and rhombic forms. These are light grey rocks with a specific\r\ngravity increasing as one descends from the summit, where it is about\r\n2·5, to the base where it is 2·7, a change corresponding with increase\r\nof the ferro-magnesian minerals and with the more crystalline structure\r\nof the groundmass.\r\n\r\nThe second species, where the “grain” of the mosaic is between ·01 and\r\n·02 mm., is represented by the Vatu Kaisia rock and by that exposed in\r\nthe opposite side of the gorge. They are granitoid in appearance and\r\nhave a specific gravity of 2·68 to 2·71. Large porphyritic crystals of\r\npyroxene and hornblende, the last sometimes 7 mm. in length, occur in a\r\ndark grey base. In the slide these phenocrysts together with those of\r\nplagioclase are displayed in a somewhat scanty holo-crystalline\r\ngroundmass, where the “grain” of the mosaic averages ·012 mm. The\r\nplagioclase phenocrysts are zoned, and give in different crystals\r\nextinctions in some cases of oligoclase-andesine (10°-12°) and in others\r\nof andesine-labradorite (25°-30°). The hornblende phenocrysts in their\r\npseudomorphism illustrate the various stages of the process of\r\nconversion into fine granular and prismatic pyroxene. The least altered\r\ncrystals have dark resorption borders and are at times deeply corroded.\r\nThe pyroxene phenocrysts are for the most part rhombic; but intergrowths\r\nwith the monoclinic form occur. The pyroxene of the groundmass consists\r\nfor the most part of small rhombic prisms averaging ·05 mm. in length.\r\n\r\nThe third species, where the groundmass may be described as a coarse\r\nmosaic with a “grain” between ·02 and ·03 mm., is represented by the\r\nrocks of the peak of Na Raro and of Mount Thokasinga in the Ndrandramea\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe Na Raro rocks are light grey with a specific gravity in the\r\nunweathered state of about 2·6, and display macroscopic crystals of\r\nglassy plagioclase and hornblende. In the slide they exhibit tabular\r\nphenocrysts of the plagioclase, together with dark pseudomorphs after\r\nhornblende, in a coarsely felsitic groundmass (grain ·022 mm.) where a\r\nlittle very fine prismatic pyroxene, apparently rhombic, occurs. There\r\nis also a little altered interstitial glass. The plagioclase phenocrysts\r\nare zoned and give extinctions of 15° to 25° (acid and basic andesine),\r\nwhilst they often show magma inclusions. An interesting feature of these\r\nrocks is concerned with the rarity or absence of phenocrysts of\r\npyroxene. They are to be seen, however, in the process of being built up\r\nwithin the substance of the hornblende pseudomorphs, which consist\r\nentirely of minute prisms and granules of pyroxene and of fine\r\nmagnetite. The process seems to consist in the formation of parallel\r\nlayers of rhombic and monoclinic pyroxene.\r\n\r\nThe Thoka-singa rocks are more basic (spec. grav. 2·72 to 2·74), and in\r\nthe scanty holo-crystalline groundmass approach the plutonic type. They\r\nare dark grey granitoid rocks displaying abundant macroscopic pyroxene\r\ncrystals 2 to 3 mm. long. The original hornblende phenocrysts are only\r\nrepresented by traces of pseudomorphs of fine pyroxene and magnetite,\r\nthe process of dispersion, described on page 307, being almost\r\ncompleted. The pyroxene phenocrysts are mostly rhombic; but intergrowths\r\nwith the monoclinic form occur. The “grain” of the mosaic of the\r\ngroundmass is coarse (·023 mm.), and there is a fair amount of prismatic\r\nwith a little granular pyroxene, the prisms, ·04 mm. long, giving\r\nusually straight extinctions, whilst the granules are apparently\r\nmonoclinic.\r\n\r\n\r\n      SUB-CLASS QUARTZ-HORNBLENDE-HYPERSTHENE-ANDESITES OR DACITES\r\n\r\nThese rocks are infrequent. They compose in mass the adjacent mountains\r\nof Ngaingai and Wawa Levu in the Ndrandramea district, and appear also\r\non the lower slopes of the neighbouring mountain of Navuningumu. They\r\ndiffer chiefly from the hornblende-hypersthene-andesites in the presence\r\nof porphyritic quartz, which, however, is not as a rule abundant. In\r\ntheir general origin and affinities and in their mode of occurrence they\r\ncannot be separated from the two sub-classes of hypersthene-andesites\r\nand hornblende-hypersthene-andesites before described. They all belong\r\nto the felsitic order of the sub-class, and all are referred to the\r\nsub-order with prismatic pyroxene and to the section with plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts.\r\n\r\nThey are light grey rocks, with a specific gravity of 2·57 to 2·61,\r\nshowing usually dark pseudomorphs after hornblende and a little\r\nporphyritic quartz. In the slide they display these pseudomorphs and\r\nquartz crystals, associated with abundant plagioclase phenocrysts, in a\r\nfelsitic groundmass, evidently a mixture of felspar and quartz, with\r\nfine pyroxene, mostly prismatic and rhombic. Pyroxene phenocrysts are\r\nabsent or rare; but they may be seen in process of formation in the\r\nsubstance of the hornblende-pseudomorphs. It is only at times, as in the\r\ninstance of the Navuningumu rock, that the brown hornblende phenocrysts\r\nare in part unchanged and that complete pyroxene phenocrysts occur. In\r\nsuch cases the last may be entirely rhombic, or may exhibit at times\r\nintergrowths with the monoclinic form.\r\n\r\nThe plagioclase phenocrysts, 2 mm. in size, are often tabular and zoned\r\nand give two sets of extinctions, indicating acid and basic andesine.\r\nTheir abundant inclusions are arranged in zones. The quartz-crystals, 1\r\nto 2 mm. in size, present hexagonal sections with rounded angles. They\r\nare sometimes traversed by cracks occupied by iron oxide films. The\r\npseudomorphs after hornblende, which consist of fine pyroxene mixed with\r\nmagnetite, exhibit often the building up in their interior of pyroxene\r\nphenocrysts, apparently rhombic, by long parallel rows of stout prisms.\r\nIn other cases the pseudomorphs display the different stages of\r\ndispersion. The fine pyroxene of the groundmass consists mostly of\r\nrhombic prisms (·02-·06 mm. long) with some granules. The “grain” of the\r\ngroundmass is usually between ·01 and ·02 mm. There is little or no\r\nresidual glass.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of Wawa Levu and Ngaingai are closely similar, but they differ\r\nin the size of the prismatic pyroxene of the groundmass, which is\r\ncoarser in the first-named mountain (·055 mm. long) than it is in the\r\nsecond (·025 mm. long). In both the “grain” of the mosaic is about the\r\nsame (·014 mm.).\r\n\r\n\r\n        TABULAR COMPARISON OF THE ACID ANDESITES OF VANUA LEVU.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The figures in the columns headed “Felsitic” and “Rhombic” refer\r\nto the size in millimetres of the felsitic “grain” and the larger\r\npyroxene prisms.\r\n\r\n Column headings:\r\n\r\n P: Plagioclase.\r\n Q: Quartz.\r\n H: Hornblende or its pseudomorph.\r\n R: Rhombic Pyroxene.\r\n M: Monoclinic Pyroxene.\r\n O: Orthophyric.\r\n Rh: Rhombic.\r\n Mo: Monoclinic.\r\n\r\n +------------+----+---------------------+---------------------------+\r\n |            |    |     Phenocrysts.    |        Groundmass.        |\r\n |            |    +-+-+--------+-+------+-------------+-------------+\r\n | Locality.  | Sp.| | |        | |      |  Structure. |  Pyroxene.  |\r\n |            | Gr.|P|Q|   H    |R|  M   +-----------+-+------+------+\r\n |            |    | | |        | |      | Felsitic. |O|  Rh  |  Mo  |\r\n +------------+----+-+-+--------+-+------+-----------+-+------+------+\r\n |Ngaingai,   |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | summit     |2·57|+|+|   +    | |      |  + ·014   | | + ·03|      |\r\n |            |    | | |pseudom.| |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |Ngaingai,   |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | lower part |2·57|+|+|   +    | |      |  + ·013   | | + ·02|      |\r\n |            |    | | |pseudom.| |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |Wawa-levu,  |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | 1,500 feet |2·61|+|+|   +    | |      |  + ·015   | | + ·05|      |\r\n |            |    | | |pseudom.| |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |Wawa-levu,  |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | 1,500 feet |2·61|+|+|   +    | |      |  + ·014   | | + ·06|      |\r\n |            |    | | |pseudom.| |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |Wawa-levu,  |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | west side  |2·57|+|+|   +    |+|      |  + ·022   | | + ·04|      |\r\n | of base    |    | | |pseudom.| |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | but not on |    | | |in great| |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | mountain   |    | | |  part  | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |Ndrandramea,|    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | summit     |2·44|+| |   +    |+|  +   |  + ·007   | | + ·01|      |\r\n |            |    | | |  only  | |scanty|   hemi-   | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | | traces | |      |crystalline| |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |   of   | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |pseudom.| |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |Ndrandramea,|    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | 1,600 feet |2·58|+| |   +    |+|  +   |  + ·008   | | + ·01|      |\r\n |            |    | | |  only  | |scanty|   hemi-   | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | | traces | |      |crystalline| |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |   of   | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |pseudom.| |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |            |    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n |Ndrandramea,|    | | |        | |      |           | |      |      |\r\n | 1,200 feet |2·68|+| |   ?

As a matter of\r\nfact there is practically only one form of rhombic pyroxene represented\r\nin my collections whether in acid or basic andesites or in\r\nhemi-crystalline and plutonic rocks. In the acid andesites it occurs not\r\nonly as phenocrysts but also as minute prisms forming a constituent of\r\nthe groundmass.\r\n\r\nThis mineral, when composing the phenocrysts, presents itself usually as\r\nsingle untwinned prisms which exhibit the typical octagonal\r\ncross-sections with much reduced prism-faces. The prismatic sections\r\ngive straight extinctions; whilst with the cross-sections we obtain\r\nstraight extinctions parallel with the pinakoid faces. The colour in\r\ntransmitted light is pale brownish yellow. The pleochroism, though\r\nusually feeble, is quite distinct, the colour being pale yellow when the\r\nprism lies parallel with the long axis of the lower nicol, and almost\r\nwhite when it lies across. Not infrequently these phenocrysts behave\r\nabnormally and give small oblique extinctions. This is often the case\r\nwhen monoclinic pyroxene occurs in the same section. The association of\r\nthe two pyroxenes in one crystal can in some cases be clearly\r\nrecognised. At one time a plate of pyroxene exhibits itself as a coarse\r\naggregate of the two pyroxenes. At other times the two occur as parallel\r\nintergrowths, as in the accompanying figure. But it is rarely that such\r\nintergrowths are so typically displayed, the reason of which has been\r\nsupplied by Zirkel in his _Lehrbuch der Petrographie_; 2nd edit.: I.\r\n271.\r\n\r\n_Note on the “magmatic paramorphism”[119] of the hornblende\r\nphenocrysts._—Reference has before been made in the general description\r\nof these rocks to the dark alteration margins of the hornblende\r\nphenocrysts. The dark borders display the “bacillary” structure noticed\r\nby Renard in the case of some hornblende andesites from Kandavu in the\r\nsame group of islands,[120] being composed of minute granules and\r\nparallel prisms of pyroxene and also of magnetite grains. With the\r\nKandavu rocks Renard observed that the tiny pyroxenes were colourless or\r\ngreenish and had an extinction angle of 40°. In the Vanua Levu rocks,\r\nhowever, there is a mixture in these dark margins of both monoclinic and\r\nrhombic pyroxene; and the process may be observed in all stages as it\r\nadvances into the interior of the crystal, until a dark pseudomorph or\r\nparamorph of pyroxene and magnetite results. When the magnetite\r\nprevails, the pseudomorph may ultimately form a black patch in which the\r\nprocess is obscured. But when, as is generally the case, the pyroxenes\r\nare more frequent, it occurs as a dark grey mass.\r\n\r\nFinally follows the dispersion of the pseudomorph, which first becomes a\r\nloosely arranged aggregate of the two pyroxenes and magnetite, and then\r\nbreaks down, and at length is only represented by small pale patches of\r\nits original constituents. These patches are easily recognisable, and in\r\nnot a few rock-sections offer the only indication of the previously\r\nexisting hornblende phenocryst. There can be little doubt that this is\r\nthe source of much at least of the often abundant pyroxenes of the\r\ngroundmass, which are usually most frequent in the vicinity of the\r\npatches.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest stage when the dark border alone exists, it is not easy\r\nto distinguish the one pyroxene from the other, the granules and prisms\r\nbeing colourless and very minute, less than ·01 in size. But in a far\r\nadvanced stage of the paramorphism the granules and prisms become\r\nsometimes much larger, the first attaining a breadth of ·04 and ·05 mm.\r\nand the last a length of ·15 mm. Finally the interior of the paramorph\r\nis seen to be more or less completely composed of very pale brown augite\r\nand pale yellow rhombic pyroxene in coarse grains and prisms, the first\r\ndistinguished by its oblique extinction of 30° to 35°, the last\r\nrecognised by its straight extinction and feeble though distinct\r\npleochroism.\r\n\r\nAlthough as a rule the paramorph becomes dispersed and its pyroxene\r\nconstituents are added to the groundmass, it sometimes exhibits a change\r\nof another character. In this case the outer portion is alone dispersed,\r\nwhilst the growth of a single large crystal of pyroxene proceeds within\r\nthe mass. In a later stage, when the dispersion of the outer part is\r\ncomplete, we have a fresh-looking pyroxene phenocryst with unformed\r\nedges, on the borders of which little granules and prisms of pyroxene\r\nmay be seen arranging themselves, as if the crystal-building was still\r\nin progress, or rather as if it had been interrupted and left unfinished\r\nby the too rapid dispersion of the outer portions of the paramorph.\r\n\r\nIt will be gathered from the above that the source of the pyroxene of\r\nthe groundmass is to be found in the magmatic paramorphism of the\r\nporphyritic hornblende. The hornblende is dark-brown, markedly\r\npleochroic, and extinctions up to 15° are given in prismatic sections.\r\nIt is well known that the conversion of a hornblende crystal into an\r\naggregate of pyroxene prisms and magnetite was long since experimentally\r\neffected by Doelter and Hussak by immersing the hornblende in molten\r\nbasalt, andesite, &c.[121] I would imagine that the transformation of\r\nthe hornblende and the dispersion of the paramorph occurred under two\r\nconditions; in the first case whilst the “flow” was still in motion when\r\nthe resulting pyroxene would be mixed up in the magma; in the second\r\ncase after movement had ceased, but before consolidation of the\r\ngroundmass, when a paramorph or pseudomorph would be formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OLIGOCLASE-TRACHYTES\r\n\r\nThe term “trachyte” is here applied in a general sense to a group of\r\nlight-grey intrusive acid rocks, having a specific gravity when compact\r\nof 2·4 to 2·45 and showing phenocrysts of glassy felspar, but not of\r\nquartz. These rocks, which are especially characteristic of the\r\ndistricts around Tawaki and Mount Thuku and of the Wainikoro sea-border,\r\nare often open-textured and sometimes a little vesicular, whilst several\r\nof them exhibit some degree of alteration in the groundmass. In all\r\ncases they appear to be intrusions rather than surface-flows; and at\r\ntimes they display a columnar structure.[122]\r\n\r\nThe difference between the oligoclase-trachytes in various localities\r\nappears to be mainly concerned with the varying degrees of\r\ncrystallisation. There are two principal varieties. In the most\r\ncrystalline type there are small phenocrysts of glassy felspar and a few\r\nof pale augite, the angle of extinction of the last being over 30\r\ndegrees. The felspar phenocrysts, which contain but few inclusions and\r\nhave sharp rectilinear outlines, in most cases show zoning and give\r\nlamellar extinction of 5° to 12° indicating oligoclase; but some of them\r\nhave the tabular untwinned or simple twinned form of sanidine. The\r\ngroundmass is in the main composed of minute felspar-lathes, less than\r\n·1 mm. in length, arranged in a dense plexus, and giving nearly straight\r\nextinctions. But it also contains a number of scattered larger\r\nfelspar-lathes averaging ·2 mm. in length and giving extinctions of 5°\r\nwhen simple, and of 8° to 10° when lamellar. There is also some small\r\nprismatic augite in the groundmass but often decomposing. The original\r\ninterstitial glass is represented by numerous reddish-brown patches of\r\ndevitrified glass.\r\n\r\nIn the second type of these trachytes, the rock is more open in texture\r\nand is at times vesicular, the specific gravity being usually less than\r\n2·4. The general characters are much the same, but sanidine is better\r\nrepresented among the phenocrysts, and the groundmass is more blurred;\r\nbut when the felspar-lathes are distinct they give an extinction either\r\nnearly straight or from 4° to 8°, according as they are simple or\r\ndisplay lamellæ. The augite of the groundmass is scanty and more or less\r\ndecomposed; whilst the interstitial glass when unaltered is in fair\r\nquantity and nearly isotropic.\r\n\r\nThe alteration observed in several of these oligoclase-trachytes is\r\nrestricted chiefly to the interstitial glass in which secondary quartz\r\nand at times calcite and viridite are developed. Scarcely any of them\r\nare quite free from these changes.[123]\r\n\r\nThe pitchstone or vitreous form of these trachytes is displayed in the\r\nblocks of an agglomerate-tuff between Tawaki and Mount Thuku. It has a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·36, is dark-brown, and has a conchoidal fracture.\r\nPhenocrysts of felspar, mostly oligoclase, with extinction-angles of 5°\r\nto 11°, and often penetrated by the magma, are inclosed in a\r\nsemi-isotropic groundmass showing incipient development of felspar and\r\nother darker microliths. There are also a few small phenocrysts of pale\r\naugite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 QUARTZ PORPHYRIES AND RHYOLITIC ROCKS\r\n\r\nWichmann when he wrote in 1882 that no quartz-bearing younger eruptive\r\nrocks had hitherto been observed either in Fiji or in the South Sea\r\nIslands generally, had apparently overlooked Dana’s observations in the\r\nFijian group. The American geologist[124] refers to a rock found on the\r\nnorth-east shores of Vanua Levu which exhibited in a greenish base\r\nthickly disseminated crystals of quartz (bipyramidal dodecahedrons, 1/8\r\nof an inch in diameter) and glassy felspar, together with a few sphene\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\nQuartz porphyries, akin to the rhyolites, are especially characteristic\r\nof the north-east part of the island, to which in fact they are entirely\r\nconfined. They perhaps are best represented in the vicinity of Mount\r\nThuku and in the neighbourhood of the mouth of the Wainikoro River. None\r\nof my specimens have the fresh appearance of the Lipari rhyolites and\r\nall are more or less altered. Their specific gravity does not exceed\r\n2·4, and they are for the most part intrusive in character.\r\n\r\nA rock frequently exposed between Tawaki and Mount Thuku[125] contains\r\nabundant phenocrysts of glassy felspar (oligoclase and sanidine) and\r\nquartz in a greenish opaque groundmass having a blurred microfelsitic\r\nstructure. There appears to have been a secondary devitrification of the\r\ngroundmass since consolidation. The porphyritic quartz crystals are\r\nrounded and about 2 mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nAnother rock displayed in the coast-cliffs on the north side of Natewa\r\nBay, a mile east of Mount Thuku, has a somewhat banded appearance. It\r\nshows crystals of quartz, more or less rounded and 3 to 4 mm. in\r\ndiameter, together with phenocrysts of glassy felspar (oligoclase with\r\nlamellar extinction of 5° and sanidine). The groundmass displays traces\r\nof spherulites and is in places semi-isotropic; but for the most part it\r\nis microfelsitic.\r\n\r\nThe type of rock found in the Wainikoro district and in the adjacent\r\nsea-border, where it may be observed forming dykes in the pumice-tuffs,\r\nis light-grey and loose-textured with a specific gravity of 2·1. It\r\nexhibits small phenocrysts of quartz and of glassy felspar (oligoclase\r\n5° to 12°, and sanidine), with, in one locality only, a scanty amount of\r\ndark green hornblende yielding extinctions up to 20°. The quartz\r\ncrystals, which are 1 to 2 mm. in size, are sometimes bipyramidal; but\r\nare often rounded and have fused-like outer surfaces. The groundmass is\r\nsemi-isotropic with a blurred aspect, and shows traces of spherulites\r\nand numerous crystallites, with occasional felspar-lathes giving a\r\nnearly straight extinction.\r\n\r\nAn extensively altered quartz porphyry of a different type is associated\r\nwith other altered rocks at the base of Mount Nailotha. It has a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·54, and displays large opaque crystals of\r\nplagioclase, 2 to 5 mm. in size with small quartz crystals 1 to 2 mm.\r\nacross, in a grey compact matrix. The first-named shows the felspar to\r\nbe mostly replaced by alteration products; but occasionally a lamellar\r\nextinction of 6° or 7° can be observed. The quartz crystals are rounded\r\nand penetrated by the magma, and contain numerous strings of\r\nfluid-cavities. The groundmass was originally spherulitic; but this\r\nstructure is more or less disguised by the development of a mosaic of\r\nchalcedonic quartz. It shows some micro-porphyritic patches of viridite\r\nand calcite. A singular altered white rhyolitic rock is exposed on the\r\nnorth coast of Natewa Bay between Natasa and Sangani, where it is\r\nassociated with altered tuffs. It is compact with a conchoidal fracture\r\nand has a specific gravity of 2·48. The hand-specimen has a banded\r\nappearance. Under the microscope it appears as a rhyolitic glass for the\r\nmost part devitrified and rendered opaque by the formation of secondary\r\nsilica. Much of it presents a microfelsitic structure, the bands\r\nappearing as semi-opaque streaks.\r\n\r\nGlassy forms of the quartz porphyries or intrusive rhyolitic rocks are\r\nextensively represented in the pumice tuffs of the Undu Promontory and\r\nof the coasts between the Langa-langa river and Lambasa. These tuffs\r\nwill be found described on page 336. Fragments of a grey rhyolitic glass\r\nlooking like perlite are inclosed in the pumice-tuffs near the mouth of\r\nthe Wainikoro River. Under the microscope it is displayed as a\r\ncolourless glass inclosing phenocrysts of sanidine, oligoclase (ext.\r\n4°), and quartz, the last with rounded outlines and a fused-like outer\r\nsurface. The glass shows in places perlitic cracks; but it is mainly\r\ncharacterised by a vacuolar structure, the minute cavities being\r\nlengthened out in the direction of the flow and displaying eddy-currents\r\naround the phenocrysts. The elongated steam-cavities sometimes contain\r\nwater, but are usually more or less filled with granular materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                Basic Glasses and Volcanic Agglomerates\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BASIC PITCHSTONE AND BASIC GLASS\r\n\r\nIT is not possible to draw a sharp distinction between the pitchstone\r\nand the purely vitreous condition of these glasses. The following\r\nremarks will therefore apply to both.\r\n\r\nRegarded as components of the pitchstone-tuffs and palagonite-tuffs\r\nthese rocks have a very extensive distribution in the island; but in the\r\nmassive state they are hardly ever to be found, whilst in the form of\r\nagglomerates they are only frequent in certain localities, as in the\r\ncliffs of the Korotini Bluff, in the vicinity of Mbale-mbale, on the\r\nslopes of Soloa Levu, and in the dividing ridge between the Mbua and\r\nLekutu plains. On rare occasions they are to be found in a rubbly\r\ncondition, as in the upper part of a basaltic flow described on p. 92,\r\nor they may form veins in a more crystalline basaltic rock as at\r\nVatulele Bay. Their specific gravity ranges from 2·61 to 2·77, and they\r\nfuse readily before the blow-pipe, the melting beginning in the ordinary\r\nflame. Since they are not dissolved under any condition in HCl, they\r\nwould be referred to the old hyalomelane group of basic glasses.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of these rocks occurs on the slopes of Soloa\r\nLevu. As displayed on the south-west slope, it presents itself as a\r\nbrownish-black rock with a specific gravity of 2·61 and exhibiting large\r\nporphyritic crystals (6 to 8 mm.) of plagioclase. It is generally\r\ncompact, but it is in places a little vesicular, the minute cavities\r\nbeing often filled with a zeolite. The mode of occurrence of this\r\npitchstone-porphyry is described on p. 104. In the slide the plagioclase\r\nphenocrysts give lamellar extinctions (21°-27°) of andesine labradorite,\r\nand have regular outlines, with but few inclusions of the glassy magma.\r\nThere are also a few small phenocrysts of augite with dark rounded\r\nborders and showing in some cases lamellar twinning. The groundmass is a\r\nbrown rather turbid glass in which dark points of devitrification occur.\r\nIt is traversed by cracks that also penetrate the felspar phenocrysts.\r\nThese cracks are filled with a feebly refractive material like\r\npalagonite; and there are traces of the early stage of the palagonitic\r\nchange in one or two places. This is of importance, because on the\r\nnorth-west side of the hill occurs the same rock, in which the basic\r\nglass has been converted into a reddish-brown almost opaque palagonite;\r\nbut in this case the porphyritic crystals of plagioclase are more\r\naffected by the magma, being rounded and extensively penetrated\r\nschiller-fashion by this material; whilst the augite phenocrysts are\r\nsomewhat similarly affected. The altered glass is also vacuolar, the\r\ncavities being filled with a zeolite. There is an indication of some\r\ndegree of crushing in the fracture of some of the felspar phenocrysts\r\n_in situ_. There appears to be a connection, as shown on p. 342, between\r\nthe crushing of a basic glass and the formation of palagonite. It is\r\nnoteworthy that with this change the specific gravity drops from 2·61 in\r\nthe comparatively fresh rock to 2·14 in the palagonitised hydrated\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAs another example of these basic pitchstones I will take that forming\r\nan agglomerate near Mbale-mbale. It has a specific gravity of 2·77 and\r\ndisplays phenocrysts of plagioclase, olivine, and augite. The\r\nfirst-named, which give the lamellar extinction of acid labradorite,\r\n(22°-28°), are fresh-looking and only affected to a small extent by the\r\nmagma. Those of olivine and augite are in much the same condition. The\r\nglass of the groundmass is rather turbid and displays numerous dark\r\npatches of incipient crystallisation, which in some cases prove to be\r\ncomposed of brush-like crystallites around a clear H-shaped nucleus, and\r\nin other cases have a more prismatic form.\r\n\r\nA vitreous rock having some of the characters of a variolite is found\r\nnear Narengali (see page 150). It, however, has the low specific gravity\r\nof 2·43 and is not readily fusible with the blow-pipe. It displays an\r\nimperfect spheroidal structure on a small scale, being made up of\r\nnodules, the largest having the size of a filbert. In the slide it\r\nappears as a grey glass made up of sheaf-like aggregates of fibre-like\r\ncrystallites, apparently of felspar, with minute skeleton prisms of\r\npyroxene in parallel arrangement, and is traversed by perlitic cracks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE VOLCANIC AGGLOMERATES\r\n\r\nIn this place my remarks will be chiefly confined to a summary of some\r\nof the leading features of these formations. The agglomerates, which\r\npass by all gradations through the tuff-agglomerates into the submarine\r\ntuffs, rank amongst the most prevalent and the most conspicuous of the\r\nrocks exposed at the surface in this island. Their lithological\r\ncharacters vary according to the type of the massive rocks of the\r\ndistrict. Thus in the Ndrandramea district the blocks are composed of\r\nthe prevailing acid andesites. In the Koro-mbasanga district they are\r\nformed of hypersthene-augite-andesites. In the Korotini and Va-lili\r\nranges they are composed of olivine basalts and basaltic andesites. The\r\nagglomerates derived from basaltic rocks and basic andesites are by far\r\nthe most frequent, and it is to them that the following general\r\nobservations apply.\r\n\r\nThe basic agglomerates and tuff-agglomerates are found almost everywhere\r\nand at all elevations up to 2,500 feet above the sea and over. They\r\ncompose the inland cliffs and the long lines of precipitous declivities\r\nthat give character to the valleys and gorges of the mountainous\r\ninterior. The blocks are often scoriaceous and semi-vitreous, but the\r\ncharacters of the rocks will be found described on page 316. They are\r\ngenerally sub-angular and vary in size from a few inches to one or two\r\nfeet; and, though sometimes heaped together in confusion, they will\r\ngenerally be found in the case of any extensive exposure to be rudely\r\nsorted according to size, or to present a rude horizontal arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe matrix varies much in amount, being sometimes barely appreciable and\r\nat other times so abundant that the deposit may be termed a\r\ntuff-agglomerate. Typically it has the character of the palagonite-tuffs\r\nof mixed composition described on page 326, being made up of fragments\r\nof palagonitised vacuolar basic glass, portions of crystals of\r\nplagioclase and augite, with the debris of the basic semi-vitreous and\r\nhemi-crystalline rocks forming the blocks. When it is scanty it contains\r\nneither carbonate of lime nor organic remains; but in the\r\ntuff-agglomerates it may be calcareous and may inclose tests of\r\nforaminifera and molluscan shells.\r\n\r\nFrom the circumstance that the basic agglomerates overlie submarine\r\nsedimentary tuffs and clays almost everywhere, their submarine origin\r\ncould alone be safely postulated. There are one or two localities that\r\nthrow especial light on the conditions under which these accumulations\r\noccurred. They are dealt with at some length in the general description\r\nof each district and only a brief reference can be made to some of their\r\nindications here.\r\n\r\nThe testimony supplied by the interesting exposures on the slopes of\r\nMount Thambeyu (page 178) goes to show that after the deposition of the\r\nforaminiferous tuffs and clays the stage of the agglomerates was ushered\r\nin gradually. The tuffs increased in coarseness, and afterwards they\r\nwere covered up with an agglomerate formed of blocks at first only one\r\nor two inches in size, but afterwards of larger dimensions.... Curious\r\nevidence is afforded by the agglomerates of Mount Vungalei (page 213),\r\nwhere two beds of palagonite-tuff, at elevations of 900 and 1,700 feet,\r\nmark two pauses in the accumulation of the agglomerates. In each case\r\nthe pause was introduced by the gradual decrease of the agglomerates\r\nwhich gave place by gradation to the tuffs. In each case also the pause\r\nwas followed by a sudden renewal of the deposition of agglomerates.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the maximum thickness of these deposits, it would\r\nappear that on the slopes of the Korotini Range this amounts to some\r\nhundreds of feet, if we also include the tuff-agglomerates. Their origin\r\nis to be attributed partly to eruptions and partly to marine erosion.\r\nThe two agencies although often associated were in their turns\r\npredominant in their different phases, and it is not too much to suppose\r\nthat the agglomerates without arrangement, with scanty matrix, and\r\ncomposed of scoriaceous blocks, belong more to an eruptive period, and\r\nthat those with abundant tufaceous matrix and sorted blocks are mainly\r\nthe product of marine erosion. In either case the deposition was\r\nsubmarine.\r\n\r\nBut the history of these agglomerates and of their associated\r\nforaminiferous tuffs and clays must of necessity be a complicated one,\r\nsince they indicate a minimum emergence of 2,500 feet. Their\r\naccumulation first began when a number of vents, in linear arrangement,\r\nwere striving to raise their heads above the surface of the sea. It was\r\ncontinued after the waves had ultimately worn the volcanic islets down\r\nto below the sea-level, and the shoals became covered over with\r\nsubmarine deposits. Again and again no doubt this struggle between the\r\neruptive agencies and the waves was renewed, until at length the great\r\nemergence began, and probably from that date the agency of marine\r\nerosion was predominant.\r\n\r\nWhen on the island of Stromboli I had presented for my observation at\r\nleast two modes of agglomerate-building under the sea. There was the\r\nordinary work of the marine erosion of the lava-cliffs, of which the\r\nbeach represents but a small part of the result; and there were the\r\ndribbling eruptions of the crater, from which at intervals of only a few\r\nminutes masses of semi-molten lava bounded down the steep slopes into\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n_Note on the general characters of the rocks of the basic\r\nagglomerates._—In appearance the basic rocks forming the blocks are\r\noften very similar. They are usually compact blackish with a\r\nsemi-vitreous aspect and display some plagioclase phenocrysts. But to\r\nenumerate the types to which they belong would be to go over much of the\r\nground traversed in the classification of the basic rocks, whether\r\nolivine basalts, basaltic andesites, ordinary augite-andesites, or\r\nhypersthene-augite-andesites. The groundmass as a rule contains much\r\nsmoky glass, but the hemi-crystalline portions of it vary considerably\r\nin character. Whilst fine granular augite prevails, semi-ophitic coarser\r\naugites are not uncommon, and prismatic pyroxene, sometimes of the\r\nrhombic form, is represented in the groundmass of the rocks composing\r\nthe agglomerates of Mount Thambeyu and of the Sokena Cliffs. In some\r\nlocalities, as on the south-west slopes of the Korotini Range, rocks of\r\nthe basic pitchstone kind are predominant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n         CALCAREOUS FORMATIONS, VOLCANIC MUDS, PALAGONITE-TUFFS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE classification that is adopted in my work on the geology of the\r\nSolomon group with respect to the calcareous formations and volcanic\r\nmuds of those islands is only in part applicable to the calcareous rocks\r\nand volcanic deposits of Vanua Levu. Deposits strictly comparable with\r\nthose of the Solomon Islands here exist, and have in some places an\r\nextensive distribution; but many others cannot be referred to that\r\nclassification. In addition to the calcareous oozes and volcanic muds,\r\nsuch as are now forming off these reef-bound coasts, the result partly\r\nof marine erosion and partly of sub-aerial denudation, there are many\r\nkinds of submarine deposits in Vanua Levu that have been largely formed\r\nfrom the materials ejected by volcanic vents. Basic glasses, for\r\ninstance, often finely vesicular and usually converted into palagonite,\r\nenter largely into the composition of submarine deposits that frequently\r\nform the surface from the sea-borders to the summits of the\r\nmountain-ranges; and it is by the degradation of a land-surface formed\r\nof such materials that the volcanic muds comparable to those of the\r\nSolomon Islands are mainly produced. It is therefore apparent that we\r\nhave to distinguish here between the deposits of sedimentary and\r\neruptive origin, a distinction, however, which is not always easy to\r\nmake, since they are in both cases submarine, and doubtless were often\r\nin process of forming together. The deposits most prevalent in the\r\nisland are the submarine tuffs partly sedimentary and partly eruptive in\r\ntheir origin and the overlying volcanic agglomerates. The first are\r\nusually palagonitic and calcareous and often contain organic remains,\r\nbeing usually associated with volcanic muds and clays mainly the product\r\nof marine erosion.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the employment of the terms “upraised” and “elevated”\r\nin the case of the Vanua Levu deposits I will take this opportunity to\r\nremark that I do not thereby commit myself to the view that there has\r\nbeen an actual upheaval of this region. This is a matter, however, that\r\nwill be found discussed in Chapter XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE UPRAISED CORAL LIMESTONES\r\n\r\nThese reef-limestones are scantily represented in the island, though one\r\ncan scarcely doubt that they were once far more extensive, having been\r\nlargely stripped off by the denuding agencies. They are mostly found on\r\nthe south coast between Naindi Bay and Fawn Harbour, and rarely extend\r\nto heights greater than 20 or 30 feet above the sea, usually composing\r\nthe sea cliffs and not occurring as a rule inland. Massive corals are\r\noften to be seen imbedded in their position of growth, as described in\r\nChapter II.; and as far as the absence of signs of disturbance is\r\nconcerned, these ancient reefs might owe their present situation, either\r\nto the withdrawal of the sea or to the upheaval of the land. Such\r\nreef-limestones exist over much of the Pacific, and they belong to the\r\nusual type of these rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SHELLY AND FORAMINIFERAL LIMESTONES\r\n\r\nThese rocks are composed partly of reef-debris, partly of volcanic\r\ndetritus, and partly of the tests of foraminifera (usually bottom\r\nforms), fragments of lamellibranchiate and gasteropod shells, together\r\nwith those of pteropods, and other organic remains. Occasionally\r\nseparate valves of the genera “Cardium” and “Ostraea” are inclosed in\r\nthe limestone. These rocks have been evidently formed in rather shallow\r\nwater. In places they overlie palagonite-tuffs and clays, also\r\nforaminiferal. Similar limestones are doubtless forming at the present\r\ntime off the coast.\r\n\r\nThey are usually hard in texture and greyish or pale yellow in colour.\r\nThey contain between 25 and 45 per cent. of carbonate of lime; whilst\r\nthe residue consists of fragments of minerals (10 to 15 per cent.),\r\nincluding plagioclase, monoclinic and rhombic pyroxene, and occasionally\r\nbrown hornblende, with siliceous casts of foraminifera (4 to 20 per\r\ncent.), mostly formed of chalcedonic silica but sometimes black and\r\nglauconitic; the remainder (30 to 40 per cent.) being composed of\r\nrounded and sub-angular portions of palagonite and semi-vitreous basic\r\nrocks, of which the larger vary from ½ to 1 millimetre in diameter. In\r\nsome cases the carbonate of lime of the inclosed organic remains has\r\nbeen mainly replaced by more or less crystalline silica. In others a\r\nrecrystallisation of the calcitic material is in progress, as described\r\non page 131; and the matrix presents in places a mosaic of calcite.\r\n\r\nThese rocks have therefore been subject to some degree of alteration,\r\nthe causes probably lying within the mass. They are, however, far from\r\nfrequent. They are best represented in the upper valley of the Sarawanga\r\nRiver in the vicinity of Tembe-ni-ndio, where they reach to a height of\r\nabout 250 feet above the sea. The greatest elevation at which I found\r\nthem was in the mountainous interior of the Waikawa Promontory, where\r\nthey occur at a height of 1,100 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nAs samples, the results of the examination of two rocks from the\r\nTembe-ni-ndio district are here appended:—\r\n\r\n                                   A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Carbonate of lime                                46 per cent.\r\n         {Fragments of palagonite and of semi-vitreous\r\n         {basic rocks                                      30  \"   \"\r\n Residue {Minerals                                         12  \"   \"\r\n         {Secondary silica replacing the carbonate of\r\n         {lime in the organic remains                      12  \"   \"\r\n                                                          ---\r\n                                                          100\r\n\r\nIt displays to the naked eye fragments of shells including pteropods,\r\nand numerous tests of foraminifera 2 or 3 millimetres in diameter. In\r\nthe section it displays in addition coral debris and a considerable\r\nquantity of rounded and sub-angular pieces of palagonite and\r\nsemi-vitreous basic rocks, usually less than a millimetre across, with\r\nsmaller fragments of minerals (pyroxene and plagioclase), and much\r\ncalcitic material in the matrix.\r\n\r\n                                   B.\r\n\r\n\r\n Carbonate of lime                                 25 per cent.\r\n Debris of palagonite and of basic volcanic rocks  45  \"   \"\r\n Minerals                                          10  \"   \"\r\n Siliceous casts of foraminifera                   20  \"   \"\r\n                                                  ---\r\n                                                  100\r\n\r\nThe organic remains mainly consist of tests of foraminifera, many of\r\nwhich occur in the residue as colourless siliceous casts. The fragments,\r\nwhether of minerals or of volcanic rocks, are usually less than half a\r\nmillimetre across. The foraminifera are mostly small and of the\r\n“Globigerina” type; but there is a cast of a tube of some\r\nboring-mollusc, and fragments of shells also occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PTEROPOD-OOZE ROCKS\r\n\r\nThese rocks are bluish-grey when not exposed; but through the hydration\r\naccompanying exposure they become much lighter in colour. They are\r\ncrowded with pteropod shells, and contain also small gasteropod and\r\nlamellibranchiate shells together with tests of foraminifera both\r\nmicroscopic and macroscopic. They yield between 30 and 40 per cent. of\r\ncarbonate of lime, the residue being made up of disintegrated\r\npalagonitic debris and fine clayey material derived from the same\r\nsource, together with a fair amount of mineral fragments (10 per cent.)\r\nwhich include plagioclase, pyroxene, and brown hornblende, and measure\r\nin the case of the larger fragments between ·1 and ·4 mm. in diameter.\r\nSuch rocks are somewhat friable and correspond with the pteropod-ooze\r\nrocks of the Solomon Islands; but they are not very frequent, being best\r\nrepresented on the flanks of the basaltic table-land between the Wainunu\r\nand Yanawai rivers, as in the vicinity of the Nandua tea-plantation\r\nwhere they extend up to 500 feet above the sea. In this particular\r\nlocality (see page 345) they overlie horizontally-stratified tuffs and\r\nclays, composed of the debris of a basic glass usually vacuolar but now\r\nfor the most part converted into palagonite, and showing a few small\r\ntests of foraminifera.\r\n\r\nThese deposits are always either surface or incrusting formations.\r\nThe circumstance of their passing down into characteristic\r\npalagonite-formations is repeated in the case of the Tembe-ni-ndio\r\nlimestones, as observed on page 131; and there is no doubt that much\r\nof their non-calcareous material is derived from the disintegration\r\nof palagonite.\r\n\r\n  _Sample of pteropod-ooze rock from below the Nandua tea-plantation._\r\n\r\n          Carbonate of lime                          38 per cent.\r\n         {Palagonitic debris and clayey material     51  \"   \"\r\n Residue {Minerals                                    8  \"   \"\r\n         {Casts of foraminifera                       3  \"   \"\r\n                                                    ---\r\n                                                    100\r\n\r\nFine clayey material makes up the greater part (72 per cent.) of the\r\nresidue. It presents the microscopic characters of material derived from\r\nthe degradation of palagonite. Amongst the mineral fragments, of which\r\nthe larger are ·2 to ·3 mm. in size, occur brown hornblende, pyroxene,\r\nfelspar, magnetite, &c. The casts of foraminifera are usually\r\nglauconitic, but a few are of crystalline silica. A number of curious\r\nlittle pellets of palagonite, oblong or oval in form, occur in the\r\nresidue. Their size is ·3 to ·6 mm., and they apparently represent the\r\nminute amygdules of palagonite that occupy the vacuoles in an altered\r\nbasic glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FORAMINIFEROUS VOLCANIC MUD-ROCKS\r\n\r\nThese deposits, which represent the “volcanic muds” forming around the\r\ncoasts of volcanic islands, are more or less consolidated clay-rocks.\r\nThey contain in varying numbers the tests of foraminifera with\r\noccasionally pteropod-shells. The former are usually minute and of the\r\n“Globigerina” type; but in some rocks larger bottom-forms prevail. The\r\noriginal colour of these deposits is bluish-grey, but as generally\r\ndisplayed they are pale-brown and considerably affected by hydration and\r\nare known as “soapstones” in the group. The ultimate effect of exposure\r\nis the production of a whitish or yellowish soapy rock that has lost all\r\nthe carbonate of lime and all the organic remains and breaks down easily\r\nin the fingers. Such a crumbling material, when examined with a high\r\npower, cannot be distinguished from the products of the final\r\ndisintegration of palagonite as described on page 348.\r\n\r\nThese deposits are frequently displayed in the lower regions up to\r\nelevations of 300 feet above the sea, incrusting the basaltic plains of\r\nLekutu, Sarawanga, Ndreketi, and Lambasa, that occupy such a large area\r\nof the north side of the island, and exhibiting there in the prevailing\r\nhorizontality of their beds the same indication that is presented by the\r\nvertical position of the columns of the under-lying basalt, namely, the\r\ncomparative absence of disturbance during the emergence. At the foot of\r\nthe mountains these deposits are interstratified with and finally\r\noverlaid by coarse palagonite-tuffs, also containing marine remains; and\r\nthese are in their turn covered over by the agglomerates that often\r\nenter so largely into the composition of the mountainous backbone of the\r\nisland. Such beds form apparently the lowest of a series which begins\r\nwith the foraminiferous clay and ends with the agglomerate. But in some\r\nplaces, as has been noticed in the cases of the pteropod-ooze rock of\r\nNandua, and of the shelly and foraminiferous limestone of Tembe-ni-ndio,\r\nbeds composed largely of characteristic palagonite lie beneath.\r\n\r\nIn the elevated interior of the island these volcanic mud-rocks are\r\nusually concealed by the tuffs and agglomerates. Occasionally, however,\r\nthey are to be seen exposed by landslips high up the flanks of the\r\nmountains, as on the slopes of Thambeyu 1,000 feet above the sea. An\r\ninteresting exposure of them is displayed in the heart of the island in\r\nthe face of the Mbenutha cliffs where the elevation is about 1,100 feet.\r\nHere they are overlaid by a thick bed of agglomerate; and tuff-beds\r\nlargely made up of vacuolar basic glass debris and showing a few\r\nforaminifera are interstratified with them; but they exhibit signs of\r\nconsiderable disturbance (see page 109).\r\n\r\nThese deposits contain between 5 and 25 per cent. of carbonate of lime,\r\nand as a rule about 90 per cent. of the residue consists of fine clayey\r\nmaterial derived from the final degradation of palagonite and of basic\r\nrocks. The mineral fragments (plagioclase, augite, rhombic pyroxene, and\r\noccasionally hornblende) vary much in amount, their average proportion\r\nbeing 13 or 14 per cent. of the mass. Their size is usually less than\r\n·2 mm. and does not exceed ·4 mm. Casts of foraminifera are nearly\r\nalways present in the residue and form generally 3 or 4 per cent. of the\r\nwhole deposit. Sometimes they are black and glauconitic; but more\r\nfrequently they are white and composed of chalcedonic silica. Such casts\r\nrepresent on a small scale the results of the same silicifying operation\r\nto which the flints and silicified corals that occur so frequently on\r\nthe surface in some localities owe their origin (see Chapter XXV.).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the age of these volcanic mud-rocks of Vanua Levu, it is\r\nmost likely that as in the case of similar deposits in Viti Levu, which\r\nwere examined by Mr. H. B. Brady, they are of post-tertiary origin.\r\nSamples of the Suva “soapstone” containing 5 or 6 per cent. of lime and\r\ndisplaying shells of foraminifera, pteropods, and other molluscs, were\r\nobtained from different heights up to 100 feet above the sea. Since 87\r\nout of the 92 species of foraminifera represented in the deposits are\r\nknown to be living now in the Pacific, Mr. Brady had no hesitation in\r\nassigning the beds to the post-tertiary epoch.[126]\r\n\r\n                   SAMPLES OF THE VOLCANIC MUD-ROCKS\r\n\r\n    A. _From districts west of Ndranimako, 100 feet above the sea._\r\n\r\n          Carbonate of lime                  20 per cent.\r\n         {Fine debris of palagonite and\r\n         {  semi-vitreous basic rocks        62  \"   \"\r\n Residue {Minerals                           14  \"   \"\r\n         {Casts of foraminifera               4  \"   \"\r\n                                            ---\r\n                                            100\r\n\r\nThe organic remains consist mainly of tests of minute foraminifera of\r\nthe “Globigerina” type, casts of which, both glauconitic and\r\nchalcedonic, occur in the residue. About 88 per cent. of the residue\r\nconsist of fine clayey materials less than ·25 mm. in size. The mineral\r\nfragments, which average about ·1 mm. in diameter, are mostly of felspar\r\nwith a little pyroxene and brown hornblende.\r\n\r\n        B. _From the Mbenutha Cliffs, 1,100 feet above the sea._\r\n\r\n            Carbonate of lime                      15 per cent.\r\n          { Fine material mainly derived from\r\n          {   the degradation of palagonite        60  \"   \"\r\n Residue  { Minerals                               23  \"   \"\r\n          { Casts of foraminifera                   2  \"   \"\r\n                                                  ---\r\n                                                  100\r\n\r\nThis rock is somewhat hard, so that the proportion of fine clayey\r\nmaterial, which is however large, cannot be accurately determined. It\r\nshows in places dark streaks composed of an abundance of minute and\r\noften perfect tabular crystals of zoned plagioclase and prisms of\r\nrhombic pyroxene, the size in neither case exceeding half a millimetre,\r\nboth of them being derived from the acid andesites of the neighbourhood.\r\nIn the slide it displays minute tests of foraminifera of the\r\n“Globigerina” type in a matrix formed mainly of palagonitic debris,\r\nfragments of minerals and semi-vitreous basic rocks. The larger\r\nfragments of the minerals and of the volcanic rocks do not exceed\r\n·15 mm.; but most of the material is very fine. The tests of the\r\nforaminifera are sometimes filled with the matrix, but often they are\r\nentirely of calcite and exhibit in polarised light a dark cross.\r\n\r\n   C. _From between Natua and Mbatiri, about 290 feet above the sea._\r\n\r\n           Carbonate of lime                                25 per cent.\r\n         { Fine material derived from the degradation of\r\n         { palagonite and of semi-vitreous basic rocks      62  \"    \"\r\n Residue { Minerals                                          2  \"    \"\r\n         { Casts of foraminifera                            11  \"    \"\r\n                                                           ---\r\n                                                           100\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively deep-water deposit, the foraminifera being minute\r\nand of the “Globigerina” type. About 90 per cent. of the residue\r\nconsists of fine clayey material, with which the calcite is so\r\nintimately mixed that each particle is highly refractive and effervesces\r\nfreely in an acid. The mineral fragments (pyroxene and felspar) are very\r\nscanty, the largest being less than ·25 mm. The white casts of\r\nforaminifera, composed of chalcedonic silica, form a conspicuous\r\nelements in the residue.\r\n\r\n       D. _From the vicinity of Mbatiri, 100 feet above the sea._\r\n\r\n Carbonate of lime                                         4 per cent.\r\n Fine material derived from the degradation of palagonite 90  \"   \"\r\n Minerals                                                  2  \"   \"\r\n Casts of foraminifera                                     4  \"   \"\r\n                                                         ---\r\n                                                         100\r\n\r\nAbout 94 per cent. of the residue consists of fine clayey material. The\r\nfragments of minerals are very scanty and are all less than ·2 mm. in\r\nsize. The casts of foraminifera are white and of chalcedonic silica.\r\nFrom the fineness of the materials and the small size and pelagic\r\ncharacter of the foraminifera, this deposit may be regarded as formed in\r\nrelatively deep water.\r\n\r\nE. _From the eastern flank of the Wainunu table-land, 200 feet above the\r\nsea._—This is a shallow-water deposit and contains, besides small\r\ngasteropod shells, large flat tests of foraminifera 5 or 6 mm. in\r\ndiameter. It possesses 24 per cent. of carbonate of lime, 62 per cent.\r\nof palagonitic debris, &c., and 14 per cent. of minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ALTERED VOLCANIC MUD-ROCKS\r\n\r\nThis group includes compact hard foraminiferous usually dark-brown\r\nrocks, which exhibit evidence of alteration in their induration, in the\r\npresence of pyrites, and in the chalcedonic quartz filling fine cracks\r\nin the rock-mass. Occasionally special types of alteration occur, one of\r\nwhich will be referred to in the description of some of the rocks given\r\nbelow. The proportion of carbonate of lime is generally small; but\r\nsometimes it amounts to 10 per cent. or more.\r\n\r\nThey admit of being examined in thin sections; and their true nature is\r\nat times so much disguised that I have taken them at first for aphanitic\r\nbasic andesites. In the slide they display a few scattered tests of\r\nforaminifera of pelagic habit in a matrix composed of the fine debris of\r\npalagonite and of basic rocks, together with fragments of plagioclase\r\nand pyroxene. Most of the material is very fine, and the size of the\r\nlargest mineral fragments does not exceed ·2 mm.\r\n\r\nSuch rocks, however, are not very frequent. They may be displayed on the\r\nflanks of mountain-ranges buried beneath basic tuffs and agglomerates,\r\nas in the case of Mount Mariko (page 187) and of the mountain-slope\r\nbehind Mbale-mbale (page 158); or they may be found at much lower levels\r\nas at Savarekareka Bay (page 190), where, however, they assume sometimes\r\na peculiar character. Though in the last-named locality the alteration\r\nis possibly connected with thermal metamorphism, it is probable that in\r\nmost instances it is a normal interstitial change occurring in beds of\r\nsome antiquity which are covered over by a considerable thickness of\r\nlater deposits. In places, where these rocks have been subjected to much\r\nhydration in the weathering process, they become red in colour, as is\r\nfound on the flanks of Mount Mariko.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SAMPLES OF THE ALTERED VOLCANIC MUD-ROCKS\r\n\r\nA. From between 400 and 500 feet above the sea on the south slope of the\r\nMariko Range.... The characters and mode of occurrence of this rock are\r\ndescribed on page 187.\r\n\r\nB. From an elevation of 1,100 feet on the south slope of the Korotini\r\nRange.... The description of the locality will be found on page 160.\r\n\r\nThis rock is hard and compact and looks like an altered basic rock\r\nshowing a few minute specks of pyrites. It is composed of fine\r\npalagonitic debris, and small fragments of semi-vitreous basic rocks and\r\nof crystals of pyroxene and felspar, none of the fragments exceeding\r\n·2 mm. in diameter. Tests of minute foraminifera, filled with matrix and\r\nof the “Globigerina” type, occur very scantily. There is little or no\r\ncarbonate of lime; but secondary silica, both colloid and crystalline,\r\nis present as an alteration product.\r\n\r\nC. From the vicinity of Yaroi, 30 feet above the sea.... The locality is\r\ndescribed on page 189.\r\n\r\nThis is a dark grey hard compact rock, containing probably between 10\r\nand 15 per cent. of carbonate of lime, and looking like an altered\r\nlimestone. In the section it displays minute tests of foraminifera of\r\nthe “Globigerina” type in a matrix composed of fine disintegrated\r\npalagonitic material, impregnated with calcite and containing also\r\nfragments of minerals (augite and felspar), none of which exceed ·2 mm.\r\nin diameter. There are also a few similar-sized fragments of\r\nsemi-vitreous basic rocks. Some fine cracks in the rock-mass are filled\r\nwith a quartz mosaic. The tests of the foraminifera remain calcitic; but\r\ntheir cavities are filled either with the matrix or with calcite or with\r\na colourless fibro-radiate mineral polarising in blackish-blue hues.\r\n\r\nD. From the south shore of Savarekareka Bay.... The locality is\r\ndescribed on page 190.\r\n\r\nThis is a bright green hard compact rock with flinty fracture and not\r\neffervescing with an acid. In the slide it shows a few casts of\r\nforaminifera of the “Globigerina” type in a matrix composed mainly of\r\nfine debris (·01-·04 mm.) of felspar and pyroxene with much greenish\r\nopaque amorphous alteration products. The abundance of pyroxene is\r\nremarkable. The material of the tests of the foraminifera is altogether\r\nreplaced by a greenish yellow mineral, occurring in grains and radiating\r\nprisms, apparently epidote.\r\n\r\nE. From an elevation of 950 feet on Mount Thambeyu.... The locality is\r\ndescribed on page 177.\r\n\r\nA hard dark grey rock containing 10 or 15 per cent. of carbonate of lime\r\nand showing fine specks of pyrites. In the slide are displayed numerous\r\ntests of foraminifera of varying size up to ·5 mm.; scattered patches of\r\npyrites; fragments of a semi-vitreous basic rock, not exceeding ·15 mm.\r\nin diameter, and of plagioclase and pyroxene; in a matrix of the finest\r\ndebris of the same materials impregnated with granules of calcite. The\r\ntests of the foraminifera are filled either with calcite, showing a\r\nblack cross in polarised light, or with a zeolite, or with pyrites, or\r\nwith the matrix.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SUBMARINE BASIC TUFFS OF MIXED COMPOSITION\r\n\r\nThese tuffs, which are composed not only of palagonitic materials but\r\nalso of the fine detritus of usually semi-vitreous basic rocks, rank\r\nfirst in frequency amongst the volcanic sedimentary deposits of the\r\nisland. In their character they pass on the one hand into the\r\nforaminiferous volcanic mud-rocks or clay rocks and on the other into\r\nthe tuff-breccias and tuff-agglomerates. We have here a series beginning\r\nwith the agglomerate and ending with the clay that represents in a\r\ngeneral sense the successive stages of the degradation of the same\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThese tuffs occur at all elevations from the sea-border, where they may\r\nform the shore-cliffs, to the upper slopes and summits of the\r\nmountain-ranges, where they are found at elevations between 2,000 and\r\n2,500 feet above the sea. In the interior of the island they are\r\ngenerally to be observed underlying the basic agglomerates. Wherever an\r\nextensive exposure of the agglomerates exists in the mountainous\r\ndistricts, these tuffs are as a rule to be found at the base of the\r\ncliffs. The precipitous bluff of agglomerate, that so often gives a\r\ncharacter to the mountainous interior, and the line of cliff of the same\r\nformation that runs along the slopes, represent the work of landslips,\r\nas is shown by the huge masses of agglomerate lying on the ground below.\r\nThese “slips” are not uncommon, and are due to the undermining influence\r\nof the springs that percolate through the tuffs and clays underlying the\r\nagglomerates.\r\n\r\nWhen the tuffs are well displayed they as a rule show stratification.\r\nThe bedding may be indicated either by distinct parting-lines or by\r\nalternating bands of varying degrees of coarseness. That these deposits,\r\nwhen occurring in mass in the upland regions, are often horizontal or\r\nbut slightly inclined, is evidenced by the Nganga-turuturu Cliffs, 1,200\r\nfeet above the sea, which are described in Chapter VIII., in the line of\r\ncliffs behind Sealevu (Chapter XI.), and high up the slopes of Mount\r\nThambeyu (Chapter XII.) as high as 1,500 feet. This is also shown in the\r\ncircumstance that the line of junction with the overlying agglomerate,\r\nexcept in rare cases, as in that of the Mbenutha Cliffs, is generally\r\nhorizontal. It is, however, not uncommon to find the beds exposed on the\r\nmountain-flanks dipping away from the axis of the range at a small\r\nangle, as on the slopes behind Mbale-mbale and in the Sokena Cliffs. In\r\nthe lower regions, where these deposits are associated with the volcanic\r\nmud-rocks on the basaltic plains, they are but slightly inclined. On the\r\nother hand, as in the Kumbulau district, the sea-cliffs for some miles\r\nmay be composed of tuffs more or less steeply tilted.\r\n\r\nThese tuffs are generally more or less compacted and have a greyish\r\ncolour; but as usually exposed in a weathered condition they are often\r\npale brown or yellowish and are more friable. They may be uniform in\r\nstructure, or they may display thin seams of a marl-like clay, or they\r\nmay contain numerous lapilli of vesicular basic glass extensively\r\npalagonitised. Not uncommonly they contain larger fragments of basic\r\nrocks, and when these are at all frequent the terms “agglomerate-tuff”\r\nor “tuff-agglomerate” have been employed according to the preponderance\r\nof either material.\r\n\r\nMany of these tuffs show no effervescence with an acid; and this is\r\nespecially the case with specimens at all weathered. On the other hand\r\nthere are just as many that contain a little carbonate of lime, not\r\nusually more than 3 or 4 per cent., but sometimes amounting to 12 or 13\r\nper cent. It often happens in the case of a series of tuffs, apparently\r\nnon-calcareous, that an occasional thin band of a fine clay-like rock\r\ncontains a good percentage of lime. It is pointed out below, however,\r\nthat the absence of effervescence does not necessarily imply the absence\r\nof foraminiferous tests.\r\n\r\nTests of foraminifera, often macroscopic bottom forms, together with\r\nshells of small gasteropods, are displayed at times; but they are as a\r\nrule in such cases not frequent. I found foraminiferous tuffs at\r\nconsiderable heights in some localities, as for instance between 2,000\r\nand 2,500 feet on the slopes of Mount Thambeyu (page 178), at an\r\nelevation of 1,850 feet on the south slope of the Korotini Range above\r\nVatu-kawa (page 158), and between 2,000 and 2,400 feet on the summit of\r\nthe range between Waisali and Sealevu (page 154). In the last-named\r\nlocality, where the tuffs are coarse and often of the nature of\r\nagglomerate-tuffs, they are highly fossiliferous; but such a character\r\nis exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe submarine origin of the tuffs can often be demonstrated in the\r\nabsence of evidence of organic remains, as by their interstratification\r\nwith foraminiferous clay rocks, such as we find at an elevation of 1,000\r\nto 1,100 feet on the top of the “divide” between the Ndreketi and\r\nLambasa basins. A single seam of marl-like rock displaying only a\r\nsolitary test of a foraminifer in the slide may throw light on the\r\norigin of the coarser tuffs with which it is associated. The use of the\r\nmicroscope is essential in the case of some of the harder tuffs, where\r\nthere has been a little alteration. Here casts of foraminifera may be\r\nobserved, although no carbonate of lime is indicated by an acid. In some\r\nlocalities where no organic remains are evident in the tuff, fine\r\nwaterworn gravel is to be noticed.\r\n\r\nThese deposits are composed as a rule of sub-angular fragments of\r\nsemi-vitreous basic or basaltic rocks and of palagonite, together with\r\nfragments of plagioclase and pyroxene, the interspaces being filled with\r\nfine debris of the same materials. The relative proportion, however, of\r\nthe three principal constituents varies considerably, the palagonite,\r\nfor instance, being sometimes scanty and sometimes abundant. The size of\r\nthe larger fragments in a tuff of the most common kind is about a\r\nmillimetre; but deposits rather finer and rather coarser are also\r\nfrequent. In the very coarse tuffs and in the breccia-tuffs, where the\r\nlarger materials are mostly of palagonite, the larger fragments may be a\r\ncentimetre in size and even more, the interspaces being filled with fine\r\ndebris of the same character cemented together often by carbonate of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of semi-vitreous basic rocks forming a regular constituent\r\nof these tuffs are usually dark and opaque and display a few plagioclase\r\nlathes. They correspond with the type of the semi-vitreous basalt or\r\nbasaltic andesite, of which the blocks of the overlying agglomerates are\r\nas a rule composed and are doubtless derived from the same source.\r\nFragments of unaltered basic glass are rarely to be observed in these\r\ntuffs. It is as a rule all converted into palagonite. This material\r\npresents itself in various stages of secondary alteration, from the\r\ncompact greenish or yellowish waxy mass to a white friable pulverulent\r\nsubstance, which represents the last stage of degradation. These changes\r\nwill be found described on page 348. It can, however, be stated here\r\nthat they are mainly concerned with hydration. In the case of the\r\nlapilli of finely vesicular basic glass, that is, of basic pumice, which\r\nare inclosed in some of the tuffs, all stages of the secondary\r\nalteration of palagonite are often exhibited, and the last stage of the\r\nchange is merely indicated by a white powdery patch containing a few\r\nminute siliceous amygdules. The puzzling little white patches so common\r\nin basic tuffs merely represent lapilli of basic pumice that have been\r\npalagonitised, and then bleached and disintegrated by hydration.\r\n\r\nThe minerals are more or less abundant and may constitute a third of the\r\nwhole mass. They include plagioclase, augite, rhombic pyroxene, and\r\nmagnetite, olivine being rare and scanty. Entire crystals of any size\r\nare infrequent. However, crystals of augite, 5 or 6 mm. in length, are\r\nfound in the tuffs at Naivaka and of the coast cliffs near the Salt Lake\r\nPassage.... It may be observed that zeolitic minerals which are\r\nfrequently developed in the tuffs consisting almost entirely of\r\npalagonite are not typical of the tuffs of mixed composition.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing suggestive of recent eruptions in any of these\r\nformations. They were formed ages since on the sea-floor at varying\r\ndepths around volcanic vents. Sometimes a cone was able to rear itself\r\nabove the level of the sea; but in most cases it rapidly succumbed to\r\nbreaker-action. Three agencies, concerned with sub-aerial eruptions,\r\nsubmarine eruptions, and marine denudation, have co-operated in the\r\nproduction of these deposits, but their parts in the process have varied\r\ngreatly. The last is indicated when the tuff is formed of a variety of\r\nbasic rocks with but little palagonite. The tuffs containing much\r\npalagonite representing an original vacuolar basic glass are regarded as\r\nmainly the products of submarine-eruptions. In those cases where lapilli\r\nof altered basic pumice occur in the deposit, sub-aerial eruptions are\r\ndirectly indicated. When an extensive exposure of these tuffs occurs, as\r\nin the case of the Nganga-turuturu Cliffs and in that of the section\r\ndisplayed near the hill of Korolevu (page 48), all three agencies are\r\noften illustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n       SAMPLES OF THE SUBMARINE BASIC TUFFS OF MIXED COMPOSITION\r\n\r\nA. As examples of the non-fossiliferous tuffs where the palagonite\r\nconstituents do not predominate, I will take those exposed in beds in\r\nthe coast cliffs and in the low hills in the vicinity of Na Tokalau in\r\nthe Kumbulau peninsula (page 90). They are grey in colour and have the\r\ntexture of a sandstone, being more or less compacted and showing no\r\neffervescence with an acid. They are composed of fragments of basic\r\nrocks and of minerals, varying in size from ·5 to 1 mm., in a scanty\r\nmatrix made up of fine detritus of the same materials and of palagonitic\r\ndebris. The fragments of volcanic rocks are rounded and sub-angular, and\r\nformed mainly of a basaltic rock, with a black opaque groundmass showing\r\nsome small plagioclase crystals and in places more or less\r\npalagonitised. There are also portions of a hemi-crystalline basic rock\r\nshowing small augite crystals. The minerals entire and in fragments,\r\nwhich make up quite a third of the mass, are mostly of plagioclase, but\r\nmonoclinic and rhombic pyroxene are also well represented. It is evident\r\nthat through the alteration of the palagonitic constituents, which were\r\nprobably more frequent when the tuffs were deposited, the structure of\r\nthe matrix is somewhat disguised.\r\n\r\nB. A yellowish grey tuff composing the cliffs on the north coast of\r\nNaivaka affords a good example of a tuff where the palagonitic materials\r\npredominate. It is somewhat fine-textured and displays a tendency to\r\nlamination. The powdered material effervesces slightly with an acid. In\r\nthe slide it is exhibited as composed mainly of palagonite and of\r\nfragments of minerals, the latter making up about one-third of the whole\r\nand ranging in size usually between ·2 and ·5 mm. A number of more or\r\nless parallel fine cracks, filled with calcite and traversing also the\r\ninclosed crystals of plagioclase, together with small fragments of basic\r\nrocks are displayed in the section. There are a few fragments of\r\nsemi-vitreous basic rocks, as just indicated, but the palagonite is the\r\nprincipal constituent. It shows numerous minute amygdules occupying the\r\noriginal vacuoles of the basic glass; and in its substance occur\r\nirregular patches formed of a colourless semi-isotropic mineral which is\r\neither zeolitic or a form of opal. Plagioclase and augite compose the\r\nmineral fragments, the former prevailing. Although these tuffs are\r\nderived from a vent that was probably the last in eruption in this\r\nisland, they display considerable alteration which is mainly connected\r\nwith the secondary changes affecting the palagonite since the deposition\r\nof these materials.\r\n\r\nC. As an example of the banded tuffs composed of coarse and fine\r\nmaterials I will take a compact grey rock forming one of the horizontal\r\nbeds in the natural section exposed near the hill of Korolevu (p. 49).\r\nIt is also an example of those tuffs which whilst not effervescing with\r\nan acid display a few casts of foraminifera in the slide. The\r\nalternating bands which are about a centimetre in thickness pass\r\ngradually into each other. The bands of finer materials are made up of\r\nsub-angular fragments, ·1 to ·2 mm. in size, of the dark opaque\r\ngroundmass of a semi-vitreous basic rock and of a grey hemi-crystalline\r\ngroundmass of an augite-andesite, together with palagonite more or less\r\ndecomposed, and fragments of plagioclase and augite, whilst the\r\ninterspaces are filled with the finer debris. The layers of coarse\r\nmaterials have much the same composition, the fragments varying usually\r\nbetween ·5 and 1 mm. in diameter, with occasional larger pieces of\r\npalagonite 2 to 5 mm. in size representing original lapilli of a\r\nvacuolar basic glass. The tests of the foraminifera, which occur\r\nscantily in the layers of fine material, are all minute. They are filled\r\nwith palagonitic material.\r\n\r\nD. The tuffs prevailing on the higher flanks of the mountainous backbone\r\nof the island are well represented by those exposed at an elevation of\r\n1,200 feet above the sea on the south slope of the Korotini Range behind\r\nMbale-mbale. It is a somewhat coarse-grained rather hard grey rock\r\neffervescing feebly with an acid. It is composed of sub-angular or\r\npartly rounded fragments, 1 to 4 mm. in size, of various basic rocks,\r\nand of rather smaller fragments of plagioclase and augite, the\r\ninterstices being filled up with fine debris of the same materials, in\r\nwhich a few minute tests of foraminifera of the “Globigerina” type may\r\nbe observed. The basic rocks of which the fragments are formed comprise\r\nthe following: (_a_) a grey aphanitic augite-andesite, with but little\r\ninterstitial glass, presenting a parallel arrangement of the minute\r\nfelspar-lathes which have an average length of ·05 mm.; (_b_) a grey\r\naugite-andesite of coarser texture but in other respects similar, the\r\nfelspar-lathes being about ·1 mm. in length, whilst there is a little\r\nmicroporphyritic plagioclase; (_c_) a semi-vitreous basaltic rock\r\nshowing small porphyritic crystals of plagioclase and augite in a\r\ngroundmass usually black and opaque, but sometimes smoky and displaying\r\nfelspar microliths; (_d_) a vacuolar basic glass more or less\r\npalagonitised.\r\n\r\nE. As a specimen of the calcareous tuffs those exposed on the south\r\nslope of the Korotini Range at an elevation of 1,850 feet may be given.\r\nThey contain about 11 per cent. of carbonate of lime and inclose a few\r\ntests of foraminifera 1 to 2 mm. in diameter. The other constituents are\r\nfragments of semi-vitreous basic rocks and of palagonite, together with\r\nfragments of plagioclase and pyroxene crystals and of an amorphous\r\nsiliceous mineral which behaves optically like chalcedonic silica. When\r\nthe rock is gently rubbed down, minute fragments of this white mineral\r\ncan be picked out. They have a wrinkled surface and an irregular form\r\nand are not affected by acids. In polarised light they display a rude\r\nmosaic or an imperfect radiate structure.\r\n\r\nF. As specimens of the fossiliferous agglomerate-tuffs composed mainly\r\nof palagonite, those exposed on the high mountain slopes of the Korotini\r\nRange at heights of 2,000 feet may be here cited. They are described on\r\np. 154.\r\n\r\n_Note._—The examples of mixed tuffs above given represent only some of\r\nthe principal types of these deposits. Short descriptions of others will\r\nbe found in the detailed account of the geology of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n                ALTERED BASIC TUFFS OF MIXED COMPOSITION\r\n\r\nThese form a group of hard compact rocks, the fragmental character of\r\nwhich is not always apparent in hand-specimens, microscopical\r\nexamination of thin sections being usually required for the\r\ndetermination of their true nature. They are commonly exposed on the\r\nsouthern flanks of the Korotini Range at the back of Vatu-kawa and\r\nNukumbolo. They are composed of compacted fragments, varying in\r\ndifferent localities from 1 to 5 or 6 mm. in size, of a variety of\r\nsemi-vitreous basic rocks, the matrix being scanty but often containing\r\nzeolites and secondary silica, whilst occasionally secondary calcite is\r\ndeveloped. They contain no organic remains, and palagonite when present\r\nis usually scanty, whilst viridite and similar materials represent the\r\ndecomposition of the pyroxene.... A hard breccia-tuff found on the\r\nflanks of Mariko and in one or two other localities contains vesicular\r\nfragments, where the steam-holes are filled with opal or chalcedony, and\r\nthe cracks traversing the matrix are also filled with this mineral.\r\n\r\nThe alteration of these tuffs has evidently arisen from a variety of\r\ncauses. In some cases the change appears to be purely interstitial. In\r\nother times it has arisen from contact-metamorphism, or from\r\nhydro-thermal agencies, as in the case of the altered tuffs near the hot\r\nsprings at Nukumbolo (p. 161).\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SUBMARINE BASIC PUMICE TUFFS\r\n\r\nThese deposits, which, however, are not of frequent occurrence, are\r\ninterstratified with volcanic mud-rocks in certain localities, as at the\r\nMbenutha Cliffs (p. 110), and in the vicinity of the hill of Korolevu\r\n(p. 47). They indicate periods of volcanic activity during the\r\ndeposition of the foraminiferous muds, with which they are associated,\r\nwhen the fine materials ejected from sub-aerial vents fell into the seas\r\naround.\r\n\r\nSuch tuffs are more or less compact and usually fine in texture. When\r\nthe glass fragments are but slightly altered, the tuff-rock is dark\r\ngrey; but when the palagonitic change is well advanced, it becomes pale\r\nand yellowish. They are made up chiefly of small fragments of a\r\nbottle-green basic glass, which are as a rule vacuolar and sometimes\r\nfibrillar; but it never happens that the pumiceous character is as\r\npronounced as in acid pumice; and in some cases the vacuoles or\r\nsteam-pores are to be observed only in the minority of the fragments\r\ndisplayed in a slide. The size of the glass fragments is as a rule\r\nsmall, in some tuffs averaging only ·1 mm. and in others ·5 mm.; but\r\noccasionally they may be 1 or 2 mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nFragments of minerals (plagioclase and pyroxene) corresponding in size\r\nto the glass fragments are as a rule well represented, forming a fourth\r\nor a third of the mass. A little fine detritus of a semi-vitreous basic\r\nrock also occurs. Tested in an acid several of the tuffs either do not\r\neffervesce or give an indication of a small percentage of carbonate of\r\nlime; whilst others effervesce freely. They usually display a few minute\r\ntests of foraminifera of the “Globigerina” type, the cavities of which\r\nare filled with fine palagonitic debris.\r\n\r\nThe palagonitic alteration is to be noticed in all cases; but it varies\r\nconsiderably in its extent. In the dark grey tuffs it affects the\r\nmargins only of a few of the glass-fragments. In the paler tuffs it has\r\nextended more into their substance, although the alteration is never\r\nmore than partial. The pale greyish material filling up the interspaces\r\nis composed of disintegrated palagonite. The steam-pores or vacuoles are\r\nsometimes empty; and at other times, especially where the palagonitic\r\nchange has begun, they are filled with a granular alteration product.\r\nThe glass fuses readily; but is not affected by acids. It is clear and\r\nisotropic, showing however a few scattered microliths. These tuffs\r\ncorrespond with the hyalomelan-tuff from the island of Munia in this\r\ngroup as described by Wichmann; but in that instance no mention is made\r\nof inclosed tests of foraminifera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  “CRUSH-TUFFS” FORMED OF BASIC GLASS\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable group of compacted tuff-like rocks which as\r\nhand-specimens would be generally regarded as pitchstone-tuffs. Their\r\ndetrital origin is, however, often very doubtful. They are composed of\r\nfragments of basic glass, carrying plagioclase phenocrysts, with the\r\ninterspaces occupied by palagonite and by the finer debris of the glass\r\nand felspar. The larger glass fragments, which vary in different rocks\r\nfrom 1 or 2 to 4 or 5 mm. in size, have been crushed _in situ_, the\r\nbroken portions often remaining more or less in position. These\r\nfragments are invested by palagonite and have eroded borders, as shown\r\nin the figure on page 342. The glass is bottle-green, non-vacuolar,\r\nfuses readily, and only at times displays incipient crystallisation. The\r\nexplanation of the origin of these rocks is attempted in Chapter XXIV.\r\nThey contain neither carbonate of lime nor organic remains. The most\r\ntypical example is present in a bed underlying a pitchstone-agglomerate\r\nnear Narengali (see page 149). It is not uncommon to find evidence of\r\ncrushing in the glassy matrix of a pitchstone-agglomerate or of rubbly\r\npitchstone, as in the Va Lili Ridge (142), the Korotini Bluff (157), and\r\nMount Soloa Levu (313); and here also palagonite has been produced\r\naround the crushed fragments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    COARSE ZEOLITIC PALAGONITE-TUFFS\r\n\r\nThese deposits represent coarse kinds of the submarine tuffs of basic\r\nglass, in which the palagonitic change is far advanced, and where\r\nzeolites and at times secondary calcite have been produced in abundance\r\nas a result of the alteration. They present themselves in the mass as\r\nmottled grey rocks which when examined in thin sections are seen to be\r\ncomposed in great part of fragments of more or less palagonitised\r\nvacuolar basic glass, whilst zeolites are extensively developed in\r\nnumerous irregular cavities and in the interspaces. Although displaying\r\nno organic remains, their submarine character is indicated as at Nandua\r\nby the circumstance of their occurring as horizontal beds overlaid by\r\npteropod-ooze deposits, or as at Tembe-ni-ndio by their forming part of\r\na series of horizontal beds with a shelly limestone and a foraminiferous\r\npalagonite clay overlying them.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of bottle green basic glass vary usually between 1 and 4\r\nmillimetres. They were originally vacuolar and at times fibrillar from\r\nthe lengthening out of the minute steam-pores; but through the\r\npalagonitic change these characters have been often disguised, and it is\r\nonly at times that the unaltered glass is observed. Plagioclase and\r\nsometimes augite and occasionally olivine formed phenocrysts in the\r\noriginal glass. The zeolites, which include chabazite and natrolite, may\r\nbe so extensively developed that they make up a fourth or a fifth of the\r\nrock mass. One may observe them in cavities where the walls are lined by\r\nfibrous natrolite with the cube-like crystals of chabazite occupying the\r\ninterior. The calcite is usually subordinate to the zeolites, but\r\nsometimes the tuff contains as much as 10 per cent. of this mineral,\r\nwhich is evidently of secondary origin.... The history of these tuffs in\r\nthe district of Nandua and Ulu-i-ndali is no doubt applicable to these\r\ndeposits in other localities. They are the products of submarine\r\neruptions which shattered into fragments the extensive palagonite crusts\r\nof flows of basaltic lava. In Chapter XXIV. I have attempted to show how\r\npalagonite is formed on a large scale in the case of such submarine\r\ndisplays of volcanic activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n           CHOCOLATE-COLOURED FORAMINIFEROUS PALAGONITE-MARLS\r\n\r\nWe have here hard, somewhat calcareous, clay-rocks which consist in\r\ngreat part (nine-tenths) of fine palagonite debris with some fragments\r\nof minerals and a little fine detritus of semi-vitreous basic rocks.\r\nSome hand-specimens would be taken for pure palagonite; but the\r\nfragmental nature appears at once in the slide. This is especially the\r\ncase with a rock exposed in a stream-course near Rewa on the shores of\r\nSavu-savu Bay (see page 95). The materials composing them are\r\nexceedingly fine, the largest fragments not usually exceeding ·2 mm. As\r\na rule they contain a little carbonate of lime and sometimes as much as\r\n10 per cent., whilst a few tests of minute foraminifera are to be\r\nnoticed in the slide. These deposits are horizontally bedded, and\r\nunderlie a pteropod-ooze rock at Nandua and a shelly impure limestone at\r\nTembe-ni-ndio. They are not very frequent, and sometimes approach in\r\ncharacters the volcanic-mud rocks, which, however, are much more mixed\r\nin composition. I regard them in the main as sedimentary deposits\r\nderived from the disintegration of the palagonitised vitreous surface of\r\na submarine basaltic flow. They pass downward at Nandua, as described on\r\npage 345, into a rock of pure palagonite; and they are only to be found\r\nin localities where basaltic plains or plateaux are covered over with\r\nsubmarine deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ACID PUMICE TUFFS\r\n\r\nThe general characters of these deposits are described on pages 10, 218,\r\n220, 222, 223, 231, 233, &c. Such tuffs are restricted to the north-east\r\npart of the island east of Lambasa and Tawaki, and are well displayed in\r\nthe coast cliffs. They are pale yellow or whitish, and are usually\r\nnon-calcareous. They are composed of the debris of a vacuolar and\r\nfibrillar isotropic glass, nearly colourless and in some localities\r\naltered. Small crystals of quartz and of glassy felspar with bits of\r\nobsidian (up to 3 mm.) and lapilli of rhyolitic glass are inclosed in\r\nthem. In places inclosed pieces of coral and coral rock indicate\r\nsubmarine deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                               PALAGONITE\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM the sea-border to the mountain-top in almost every part of the\r\nisland, palagonite occurs in a fragmental condition. It is only where\r\ntuffs are not found, as in the mountainous mass of Seatura, or where\r\nthese deposits are formed of acid rocks as in the north-east portion of\r\nthe island, that palagonite has not been observed. Perhaps, it is not\r\ntoo much to say that the later if not all the stages in the history of\r\nVanua Levu are bound up with the history of this material. In this place\r\nI will only deal with certain features in the problem connected with the\r\norigin of palagonite which seem to receive further elucidation from my\r\nobservations in this island. The literature is already extensive, and\r\nthose interested in the matter will find in Zirkel’s _Petrographie_ and\r\nin the _Challenger_ Report on Deep-Sea Deposits by Murray and Renard a\r\ngood introduction to the subject.\r\n\r\nIn Vanua Levu we are confronted with the same difficulty that has\r\nperplexed geologists in various parts of the world. If we expected to\r\nfind in this island the source of the enormous quantities of the basic\r\nglass that are represented by the palagonite of the tuffs, we should\r\nlook in vain. Basic or basaltic glass usually occurs in agglomerates in\r\nthe form of tachylytic pitchstones, as described on page 312, and is\r\nalso found at times in basic pumiceous tuffs, as described on page 333;\r\nbut it is far from frequent. Palagonite-rock, that is to say, a basaltic\r\nglass converted in mass into this substance, never came under my notice.\r\n\r\nIn order to clear the ground for the discussion of my own observations,\r\nI will quote from the report on deep-sea deposits above named. Fragments\r\nof basic glass undergoing the palagonite change are found everywhere in\r\nthese deposits and especially in the red-clay areas. The hydro-chemical\r\nmodifications determining the decomposition of these fragments into\r\npalagonite, and at the same time the formation of zeolites, have\r\nlikewise resulted in the complete transformation of these lapilli into\r\nferruginous argillaceous matter (p. 309). The authors, however, of this\r\nreport do not attribute the frequent occurrence of fragments of basic\r\nglass on the bottom of the ocean to the buoyant powers of basic pumice.\r\nUnfortunately, the problem does not permit of such a simple solution.\r\nBasic volcanic glass, writes Prof. Renard, though known only from a few\r\ngeological formations and from a few eruptions of recent volcanoes at\r\nthe surface of the continents, appears in abundance and in most typical\r\nform among the products of submarine eruptions, as if the deep oceans\r\nhad been in some way specially favourable to the development of this\r\nlithological type (p. 299).\r\n\r\nThe palagonite-tuffs of this island are described in detail in Chapter\r\nXXIII., and a few general remarks are alone needed here. This altered\r\nglass enters into the composition, to a greater or less extent and in\r\nvarying stages of disintegration, of nearly all the submarine basic\r\ntuffs and clays. In the volcanic muds, however, and in the tuffs of\r\nmixed character, which are the prevailing deposits, it is associated\r\nwith other components. Here the question of the origin of palagonite\r\nwithin the deposit does not as a rule arise, since there is nothing to\r\nindicate that this material was not derived from rocks previously\r\npalagonitised, and the point of main interest is connected with the last\r\nstages in the degradation of this substance. There are not a few cases,\r\nhowever, where, unless we assume that the lapilli of vesicular basic\r\nglass were ejected in the palagonitic condition from a volcanic vent, we\r\nmust apparently regard the alteration as having occurred in the tuff.\r\nBut even this will prove to be by no means a necessary consequence if it\r\ncan be shown, as I have attempted to do below, that the palagonitic\r\ncondition exists potentially in a particular type of basic glass and\r\nthat the effect of hydration is not so much to produce but to make\r\nevident a condition that was previously latent.\r\n\r\nIt will be therefore of interest to determine whether palagonite occurs\r\nin this island independently of the tuff-deposits, and under such\r\ncircumstances that it may be regarded as having been produced within the\r\nrock-mass. An example is afforded in the case of a basaltic flow near\r\nSoni-soni Island, which is fully described on page 92. Whilst the lower\r\npart of this flow is composed of a hemicrystalline basalt with scanty\r\nolivine, the upper portion is made of a basaltic glass which has been\r\nbroken up or crushed “in situ,” the spaces between the fragments being\r\nfilled with palagonite. It would seem from the peculiar erosion of the\r\nglass fragments that after the crushing a liquid magma occupied the\r\ninterspaces, and afterwards solidified and underwent the palagonitic\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGMA-LAKELET, ·25 mm. in size, magnified 290 diameters,\r\nfrom a basalt at Navingiri. The groundmass, which is a smoky devitrified\r\nglass containing abundant felspar-lathes, is coloured black. The\r\nmagma-lakelet is pale yellow in the slide and displays concentric lines\r\nof congelation. It behaves like palagonite.]\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is noteworthy that in the sections of the lower\r\nhemicrystalline portion of the flow there are shown in the groundmass\r\ncollections of a palagonitic material forming, as I have termed them,\r\n“magma lakelets” of microscopic dimensions (·25 mm. in average size).\r\nThese “lakelets” are irregular in form, and are not uncommon amongst a\r\ncertain type of basaltic rocks. One of them is figured above; and it may\r\nbe added that they are best examined when displayed in a groundmass\r\ncontaining much smoky, partly devitrified, glass. They are usually more\r\nor less opaque and reddish-brown or yellowish in colour, whilst they\r\nhave often a marked zoned structure, the concentric bands conforming to\r\nthe irregular contours of the lakelet. In the least affected stage the\r\nzones show fibrous devitrification across their breadth, but as the\r\npalagonitic change progresses the material becomes opaque. In the\r\nsecondary changes, such as those associated with the early alteration of\r\nthe propylites, these “magma lakelets” are the first affected. They then\r\npresent alternating layers of calcite and viridite and are often\r\nbordered by magnetite.\r\n\r\nIf these “lakelets” were to be described as collections of residual\r\nglass, the description would be insufficient, since they may occur in\r\nthe midst of a smoky, partially devitrified, glass. During the last\r\nstage in the consolidation of the basaltic mass, the magma-residuum that\r\nstill retains its fluidity collects here and there in the crevices of\r\nthe groundmass, and forms little pools of usually microscopic dimensions\r\ninto which the felspar-lathes often protrude from the sides. These\r\nlittle pools or lakelets represent that portion of the yet fluid magma\r\nthat during the last stage of consolidation is imprisoned in the\r\nstiffening mass—like the whey in a cheese—whilst the greater part of it\r\nhas been squeezed into the cracks of the cooling mass, as occurs in a\r\ndyke-like intrusion below described, or has been extruded on its\r\nsurface, as in the case of the basaltic flow above referred to.\r\n\r\nAs a suggestive instance of the formation of palagonite “in situ,” I\r\nwill now refer to a basic tuff-agglomerate on the plateau of Na Savu\r\n(see p. 81) which is penetrated by veins, a few inches thick, apparently\r\ncomposed of a finely brecciated pitchstone-tuff. In the section the\r\nmaterial forming the veins is seen to be composed of fragments of basic\r\nglass (carrying porphyritic plagioclase and augite) which have been\r\ncrushed in position, the interspaces being filled up with the finer\r\ndebris of the glass and of the minerals together with palagonitic\r\nmaterial. The glass fragments, which have lost their sharp edges and\r\nangles, are often palagonitised at the borders, and we thus get a patch\r\nof isotropic brown glass with a yellowish margin formed of a feebly\r\nrefractive turbid substance. Where this border is not so evident, it is\r\nnoticed that the edge of the glass is peculiarly eroded. The indication\r\nappears to be that the fissures in this agglomerate were filled with a\r\nbasic magma that after its solidification into a glass was subjected to\r\na crushing process, and that during this process a partial remelting of\r\nthe glass took place which resulted in the molecular change\r\ncharacteristic of palagonite. Since the unaltered glass-fragments fuse\r\nin the ordinary flame, it would seem that the heat developed during the\r\ncrushing might be sufficient to partially remelt the glass without\r\naffecting the rock penetrated by the veins.... It is of importance to\r\nnote that in the palagonite-tuffs of the Canary Islands the change is\r\noften most complete along fissures, which thus present the appearance of\r\nbeing occupied by veins of pitchstone.[127]\r\n\r\nIn this connection allusion may be made to a dyke-like mass of a rubbly\r\nsemi-vitreous basaltic rock exposed at Vatu-lele Bay, described on page\r\n184. It is penetrated in all directions by veins, 1 to 3 inches thick,\r\nof a tachylytic glass which begins to fuse in the ordinary flame. The\r\nglass is traversed by cracks which sometimes contain palagonite. The\r\nbasalt, penetrated by the veins, has a smoky groundmass displaying\r\nimperfect felspar-lathes in a feebly refractive glassy base and\r\ncontaining a few small “magma-lakelets” that cannot be distinguished\r\nfrom palagonite.[128]\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the Narengali valley (see page 149) I found what\r\nappears to be a palagonite-tuff overlain by agglomerates formed of\r\ntachylytic pitchstone and of semi-vitreous amygdaloidal basalts. The\r\ntuff consists of fragments of a brown basic glass, the larger 1 to 2\r\nmillimetres in size, carrying porphyritic plagioclase, and fractured in\r\nposition, the interspaces being filled with palagonite. The glass\r\nfragments possess the eroded margins indicated in the accompanying\r\nfigure. It may be remarked that this type of tuff differs from that of\r\nthe prevailing palagonite-tuffs in being rarely vacuolar, in the absence\r\nof marine organic remains, and in its homogeneous composition. It is\r\ndescribed on page 334 under the head of “crush-tuffs.” Whether it is\r\nderived from the destruction of a mass of basic glass that had\r\npreviously undergone crushing and partial palagonisation I cannot say;\r\nbut its characters point in the direction of this conclusion.[129]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages it has been attempted to show that\r\npalagonitisation has taken place in the veins of basaltic glass\r\ntraversing in one case a basic tuff agglomerate and in another case an\r\nintrusive basaltic mass, and that it has also occurred in the upper\r\nvitreous portion of a basaltic flow and in the materials now composing a\r\nso-called “crush-tuff.” In order to explain this group of facts I\r\nventure to propose this theory.\r\n\r\nIn certain types of basaltic lava,[130] when cooling and consolidation\r\ntake place under peculiar conditions, such as we would expect to find in\r\nsubmarine eruptions, there is a residuum of the magma with relatively\r\nlow fusibility that remains fluid after general solidification of the\r\nmass is well advanced. As the rock continues to consolidate, portions of\r\nthis magma residuum become imprisoned in the mass, like whey in a\r\ncheese, giving rise to the “magma lakelets” above described; whilst\r\nother portions, during the contraction and fissuring accompanying the\r\ncooling process, are squeezed out into the cracks thus formed, or are\r\nintruded on the surface of the consolidating mass, as in the case of a\r\nsubmarine lava-flow. This solidified magma-residuum differs from the\r\nordinary basic glass not only in its lower degree of fusibility but in\r\nits mineral composition and in its molecular condition. It probably in\r\nthe first place does not differ much in appearance from the typical\r\nglass, but it is an unstable substance and is capable under certain\r\nhydro-chemical conditions of developing the characters of palagonite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing fragments of glass with eroded borders and of\r\nplagioclase with more even edges in a matrix of palagonite traversed by\r\ncracks. The length of the largest fragment is half a millimetre. The\r\nglass has been evidently fractured in position and this is true of one\r\nof the felspar fragments. It is also apparent that whatever its cause\r\nthe erosion of the margins of the glass has been produced since the\r\nfracture.]\r\n\r\nIn those cases where the occurrence of palagonite is associated with\r\nevidence of crushing, the process appears to be in a sense reversed,\r\nsince partial palagonitisation of an ordinary basic glass takes place as\r\na result of the elevation of temperature due to the crushing. The heat\r\nthus developed is sufficient to partly fuse the glass; but since it is\r\nnot great, it only affects the most fusible constituents, and the\r\nremelted material corresponds therefore to the magma-residuum of the\r\nconsolidating mass, which is referred to in the previous paragraph. It\r\nhas the same unstable characters and the same tendency to assume the\r\npalagonitic condition.\r\n\r\nThis theory centres around the relatively low fusibility of the\r\nmagma-residuum that gives rise to palagonite. This degree of fusibility\r\nhas yet to be ascertained, since according to the views here advanced it\r\nmay even be much lower than that of tachylyte. It is, however,\r\nnoteworthy that the melting-point of tachylyte is far below that of the\r\nmore crystalline basaltic rocks, since it can be readily determined, as\r\nI have done in the instance of a dyke-like mass penetrated by\r\ntachylyte-veins before referred to, that the veins are composed of a\r\nmuch more fusible material than the rock-mass. From a very crude\r\nexperiment I would infer that the melting-point of ordinary tachylyte is\r\nnot much above that of lead (335° C). The fusion-point of an ordinary\r\nhemicrystalline basalt, according to the well-known experiments on the\r\nlavas of Vesuvius and Etna, would probably be over 1,000 degrees C.\r\n\r\nTwo interesting experiments, the one artificial, the other natural, may\r\nbe here cited in connection with this view. Bunsen[131] more than half a\r\ncentury ago, as a result of some experiments in which he produced\r\npalagonite, arrived at the conclusion that the tuffs formed of this\r\nmaterial are submarine deposits derived from the breaking up of\r\npreviously formed palagonite-masses. Having obtained this substance by\r\nplacing powdered basalt in an excess of melted potash-hydrate\r\n(Kalihydrat) and then adding water to the silicate of potash thus\r\nformed, he concluded that palagonite results from the reaction between\r\nglowing augitic-lavas and rocks rich in lime and other alkalies.\r\nAlthough Zirkel quotes in this connection the example where this\r\nmaterial has been produced in the Cape de Verde Islands by basic lava\r\nflowing over limestone, he rejects Bunsen’s explanation as inapplicable\r\nto extensive palagonite districts, such as occur in Iceland, though\r\nallowing that it would account for the local production of this\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nI venture to think, however, that in these two experiments the general\r\nprinciples involved in the production of palagonite are partly\r\nillustrated. We may accept the results of an experiment without\r\nacquiescing in its interpretation. As I take it, it is in the partial\r\nwet fusion of the powdered basalt that the secret of this successful\r\nproduction of palagonite lies. In both these experiments some of the\r\nconditions of a submarine flow have been reproduced.\r\n\r\nWhilst Rosenbusch established the true character of palagonite as the\r\nproduct of a peculiar alteration of a basic glass, Renard pointed out\r\nthe conditions under which it was most typically and in greatest\r\nabundance formed. But Bunsen was happy in his suggestion that\r\npalagonite-tuffs are submarine deposits derived from the breaking up of\r\npreviously formed palagonite masses. The question thus resolves itself\r\ninto one concerning the conditions of submarine eruptions and the\r\nbehaviour during consolidation of a submarine basaltic flow. In the\r\nnature of things the field of investigation is mainly restricted to the\r\nexamination of ancient submarine basaltic flows that have been raised\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nA remarkable series of beds exposed in a stream-course below the Nandua\r\ntea-estate may be here described in connection with the question of the\r\norigin of palagonite formations. As observed on page 86, this locality\r\nlies on the flanks of a basaltic plateau, which are incrusted with\r\nrecent submarine deposits. A pteropod-ooze, containing also the tests of\r\nlarge and small foraminifera and the shells of small bivalves, is\r\ndisplayed on the sides of the stream-course for the first 150 feet of\r\nthe descent. Below this, as shown in the diagram, is a declivity with a\r\ndrop of 60 or 70 feet where there is a waterfall. Horizontal beds of the\r\npteropod-ooze rock are exposed in the upper-third of this declivity; but\r\nbelow, they pass into a chocolate-coloured marl-like deposit also\r\nhorizontally bedded, and sometimes having a banded appearance from the\r\nalternation of layers of different degrees of fineness. This rock\r\ncontains 5 or 6 per cent. of carbonate of lime and incloses a few\r\nscattered tests of minute foraminifera of the “Globigerina” and\r\n“Nodosaria” types. In the slide the rock appears to be of massive\r\npalagonite inclosing a few felspar-lathes ·1 to ·3 mm. in length, and\r\nexhibiting a zeolite and calcite in the crevices and cracks. But it was\r\nnot until I had discovered the tests of the foraminifera and had\r\nobserved some fragments of larger crystals of plagioclase and a little\r\ndetritus of a semi-vitreous basaltic rock that its clastic character was\r\ndisclosed. The palagonite change has here to a great extent disguised\r\nthe character of the deposit.\r\n\r\nThis palagonite-marl formation is 20 or 30 feet in thickness. It passed\r\ndownward into a reddish-brown rubbly unstratified rock which falls to\r\npieces in one’s hands, breaking up into little cube-like masses an inch\r\nor two across. These masses display in their interior a radiate\r\nprismatic structure; but after drying they crumble into small fragments\r\nexhibiting the same minute prismatic structure, the miniature prisms\r\nbeing about a millimetre in diameter. Fine cracks, filled with calcite\r\nand a zeolite, traverse this rock in all directions, and no doubt this\r\npeculiar structure arises from shrinkage.\r\n\r\nMy idea that I was dealing with a clay-rock affected by the proximity of\r\nan igneous intrusion was dispelled when the powdered material presented\r\nitself as pure palagonite with scarcely any mineral fragments. Unlike\r\nthe marl above, it does not effervesce with an acid; and appears as a\r\nmass of compacted minute fragments of basic glass converted into\r\npalagonite, which is seemingly non-vacuolar, and containing about 15 per\r\ncent. of water.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the diagram it should be remarked that I did not find\r\nthe palagonite-rock actually passing down into the basalt which,\r\nhowever, is exposed in the river-bed below. The whole district is\r\ncharacterised by columnar basalt, and the series of deposits here\r\ndescribed have been formed on the flank of the great basaltic table-land\r\nof Wainunu. It is noteworthy that in the uppermost deposits of the\r\npteropod-ooze palagonite forms a noticeable proportion (10-20 per cent.)\r\nof the residue; and perhaps most of the fine clayey material is thus\r\nderived. As noted on page 321, minute pellets of pure palagonite are not\r\ninfrequent in the residue. Probably about 90 per cent. of the underlying\r\nmarl consists of palagonite. In the lowest palagonite-rock the\r\nproportion would be quite 98 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing the succession of deposits below the\r\nNandua tea-estate. The total thickness is about 250 feet. The figures\r\nrefer to the proportion of palagonite.]\r\n\r\nWhilst it is apparent that we have represented in this series the\r\ncovering of a submarine basaltic flow with submarine deposits, it is\r\nalso evident that the mode of junction between the flow and the\r\noverlying deposits is of an unexpected nature. Before drawing any\r\ninferences, it is necessary to point out that when we begin on _à\r\npriori_ grounds to frame our notions as to the course of events on the\r\nsurface of a submarine basaltic flow, we are entering a little known\r\nregion of inquiry. I would, however, suggest in the light of the theory\r\nbefore advanced, the following explanation of the appearances presented\r\nby this series.\r\n\r\nDuring the consolidation of the flow much of the magma-residuum that\r\nstill retained its fluidity was extruded on the surface, where after\r\nsolidification it became palagonitised. According to my view this would\r\nbe the typical behaviour of submarine basaltic flows; but, owing to the\r\nunstable and perishable nature of the palagonitic crust of the flow, it\r\nwould be rarely preserved in upheaved volcanic regions. There would\r\nprobably be, as in the case of the Nandua series, no sharp line to be\r\ndrawn between the palagonite-crust and the deposits subsequently\r\ncovering it, deposits indeed that would derive no inconsiderable\r\nproportion of their materials from the disintegration of the crust\r\nitself. During and after the emergence of such a district of submarine\r\neruptions the unstable palagonitic crust would be further subjected to\r\nthe hydration resulting from weathering and similar agencies; and as a\r\nresult of its final degradation there would often alone remain a bed of\r\nreddish argillaceous material.\r\n\r\nIn concluding these remarks on palagonite the following summary of the\r\nprincipal points here dwelt upon may be added:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The basic glass, that undergoes the palagonitic change, is the\r\nvitreous form of the magma-residuum that in a particular type of basalt\r\nand under certain conditions remains fluid after the mass of the rock\r\nhas solidified. During the last stage of the consolidation it is in part\r\nimprisoned in the “magma-lakelets” of the groundmass; whilst the rest of\r\nit is squeezed into cracks and fissures, or extruded on the surface of\r\nthe flow.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This glass differs from ordinary basic glass in its molecular\r\ncondition, its mineral composition, its low degree of fusibility, and in\r\nits unstable character.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The formation of palagonite in connection with the crushing of a\r\nbasic glass is to be explained by the hypothesis that the heat developed\r\nduring the crushing is sufficient to partially re-fuse the glass, the\r\nmaterial thus produced corresponding to the magma-residuum of low degree\r\nof fusibility, which is above referred to.\r\n\r\n(_d_) In submarine eruptions are to be found the conditions favouring\r\nthe production of palagonite on a large scale. In the case of such\r\nbasaltic flows it is probable that their upper portions are formed\r\nentirely of palagonite arising from the alteration of a vitreous\r\nmagma-residuum extruded on the surface in the manner above described.\r\nSuch a crust, as a result of shrinkage and other processes, would\r\nprobably present itself to the geologist as a somewhat friable material,\r\npassing gradually into the overlying submarine deposits.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Note on the type of basalt found associated with palagonite._\r\n\r\nThe type is characterised, it would appear, rather by its structural\r\nfeatures than by its mineral composition. It is the basalt of ophitic or\r\nsemi-ophitic habit that would seem to be usually associated with\r\npalagonite; and since this habit is as a rule to be found where the\r\ngroundmass displays large felspar-lathes in plexus arrangement, coarse\r\naugites, and at least a fair amount of smoky glass, it follows that a\r\nhemi-crystalline, ophitic or semi-ophitic, doleritic basalt is the type\r\nto be associated with palagonite.\r\n\r\nThis is the type of rock that forms the lower part of the basaltic flow\r\nnear Kiombo, the upper part of which is largely palagonitic. To this\r\nstructural type also belong most of the basalts in my collection where\r\npalagonite exists in the form of “magma-lakelets” in the groundmass.\r\nThese “lakelets” are almost diagnostic of this type of basalt. Here also\r\nbelongs the famous globular basalt of Acicastello on the coast of\r\nSicily.[132] In such rocks the felspar-lathes form a mesh-work and vary\r\nusually in average length between ·1 and ·3 mm. The augites of the\r\ngroundmass, typically semi-ophitic, range up to ·1 mm. in size. They are\r\nalways large, that is, over ·03 mm., and this coarseness is another\r\nimportant indication.\r\n\r\n\r\n   NOTE ON THE CHANGES PRODUCED THROUGH THE HYDRATION OF PALAGONITE.\r\n\r\nMost of that which is detailed below is not according to my views\r\npalagonitisation, but the effect of hydration in the disintegration of\r\nthis material. The initial molecular condition and the other characters\r\nwhich represent potentially the palagonitic change are not connected\r\nwith hydration; but are concerned with the causes before explained that\r\nled to the formation of a basic glass of such an unstable constitution.\r\nIndeed, there is good reason to believe that the changes to be now\r\ndescribed may be observed under the ordinary influences of weathering in\r\na wet region.\r\n\r\nThe early stages of alteration are well displayed in some of the tuffs\r\nformed mainly of basic vacuolar glass, the submarine character of which\r\nis often indicated by a few tests of foraminifera. Whilst the glass\r\nretains its original bottle-green colour, it loses the clean sharp\r\nconchoidal edges and displays rough and uneven or granular borders. With\r\na high power the surface of the fragment is seen to be minutely pitted\r\nor pock-marked in places, the shallow circular pits, less than ·01 mm.\r\nin diameter, being sometimes arranged in a row like a number of\r\noverlapping rain-prints. This process proceeds until all the surface is\r\naffected, and from this cause there is often an appearance of polygonal\r\nmarkings. The pock-marking, however, continues; and as the pits encroach\r\nmore and more on each other an irregularly wrinkled rough surface\r\nresults. Up to this time the glass has retained much of its original\r\ncolour; but its clearness is replaced by turbidity, and collections of\r\nvery minute rounded, rod-shaped, and irregular granules, composed of a\r\ncolourless feebly polarising material, are displayed here and there in\r\nits substance, whilst some of the previously empty vacuoles are now\r\nfilled with water.\r\n\r\nIn the next stage the hydration of the iron-oxides begins, and the glass\r\nbecomes opaque and yellowish or reddish-brown, and has a more granular\r\nappearance, polarising feebly. Cracks now traverse the substance, and\r\npenetrate into the vacuoles, which, as they become filled with the\r\nalteration products, whether palagonitic, zeolitic, or siliceous, become\r\nruptured and curiously distorted. The hydration and consequent\r\ndisintegration continue until the deep stain of the iron-oxide is\r\nremoved, and a semi-pulverulent whitish material remains. This is the\r\nhistory of the little bleached powdery patches so common in basic tuffs,\r\neach representing originally a lapillus of basic pumice. This powder\r\nwhen examined with the microscope is shown to be made up of fine\r\ngranular and tubercular materials which lose much of their distinctness\r\nwhen mounted in Canada balsam. It is not affected by boiling in HCl, and\r\ncontains usually an abundance of minute siliceous oval amygdules that\r\nhave been freed in the last stage of the disintegration of the\r\npalagonite.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of the degradation of the palagonite daily in\r\noperation in the basic tuffs of this island. From this source is\r\ndoubtless derived much of the finest constituents of the submarine clays\r\nso common over Vanua Levu.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supplementary note on the occurrence of palagonite in the glassy matrix\r\nof pitchstone-agglomerates and in rubbly pitchstones._—In my last\r\nrevision of the proofs I find that I have not laid sufficient stress on\r\nthe production of palagonite under these conditions. The evidence of\r\ncrushing is often very evident, and especial references to this point\r\nwill be found in the index under “Pitchstone,” and on page 334 under\r\n“Crush-tuffs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                      SILICIFIED CORALS AND FLINTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSILICIFIED corals, together with siliceous minerals (quartz, chalcedony,\r\njasper, &c.) and siliceous concretions are evidently widely distributed\r\nin these islands. Kleinschmidt in his journal refers to large blocks of\r\nflint on the island of Ono, from which the natives used to obtain their\r\nmusket-flints,[133] and he collected from this island as well as from\r\nViti Levu, Ovalau, &c., numerous specimens of these and other siliceous\r\nminerals and rocks, such as hornstone, chalcedony and jasper, which were\r\nexamined by Wichmann and described in his paper.[134] Mr. Andrews\r\nobserved silicified corals on the summits and higher slopes of Vanua\r\nMbalavu.[135] The Fijian name for flints, “ngiwa” (thunderbolt) or\r\n“vatu-ngiwa” (stone-thunderbolt), affords a good instance of that\r\ncurious superstition connected with the origin of these stones, which\r\ncame also under my notice in the Solomon Islands,[136] and in fact is\r\nwidely spread.\r\n\r\nIn Vanua Levu these siliceous rocks and minerals are in places abundant.\r\nThey are especially frequent on the surface of the extensive low plains\r\non the north side of the island which constitute the basins of the\r\nSarawanga, Ndreketi, Wailevu, and Lambasa rivers; but it is in the\r\nlow-lying district of Kalikoso, in the north-eastern part, that they\r\nexist in the greatest quantity. They do not occur usually at greater\r\nelevations than 300 feet, and are found as a rule at much lower levels.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that reference is not here made to quartz-veins,\r\nsuch as are found in certain localities and of which mention is made on\r\npages 106, 116. It is not with the ordinary products of contact or\r\ngeneral metamorphism that we have here to deal; but with the remarkable\r\nsurface-collections of silicified corals, nodules and flints of\r\nchalcedony, fragments of white quartz-rock, bits of jasper, and certain\r\ncurious siliceous concretions, that occur often in association with\r\nfragments of limonite in these low-lying regions. All the siliceous\r\nmaterials above named have, as the microscope indicates, a common\r\ncharacter, chalcedonic silica in a greater or less degree being the\r\nbasis of all of them, whether coral, flint, white quartz-rock, or\r\njasper. It soon became apparent whilst examining these districts that\r\none general condition prevailed whilst this extensive deposition of\r\nsilica and the formation of the beds of limonite were in progress. It\r\ncannot, however, be pretended that these processes are actually in\r\noperation on the plains now. Except in the case of the limonite in a few\r\nlocalities the processes have been suspended; but they were in active\r\noperation not long ago: and an examination of the general characters of\r\nthe districts will probably disclose some of the conditions under which\r\nthese products have been formed.\r\n\r\nOn the surface of the Kalikoso plains, where these materials are most\r\nabundant, we find silicified corals associated with fragments and\r\nnodules of chalcedony, flints, white quartz-rock, limonite, concretions\r\nof carbonate of iron, &c., in the low-lying and often swampy district\r\naround the fresh-water lake, the whole region being only elevated\r\nbetween 20 and 60 feet above the sea. This is an area of decomposing\r\nacid rocks (quartz-porphyries, trachytes).[137] On the other hand in\r\nmost of the regions where these materials occur on the surface we have\r\nareas of basic rocks (basalts and basaltic andesites) incrusted in\r\nplaces with submarine tuffs and foraminiferous clays, the volcanic rocks\r\nundergoing extensive disintegration. Such for instance are the Lekutu,\r\nSarawanga, Ndreketi, and Lambasa plains. In the Lambasa plains, which\r\nare described in this connection on page 139, we find besides the corals\r\nand flints and nodules of chalcedony, fragments of jasper. In the\r\nSarawanga and Lekutu lowlands, we find silicified corals and limonite;\r\nbut here the crystallised silica of the corals contains a large quantity\r\nof water, whilst in its lesser degree of hardness and in its low\r\nspecific gravity it comes near to semi-opal. In these and other\r\nlocalities, as in the level country around Ndranimako on the right side\r\nof the Yanawai estuary, we find curious concretions of the same kind of\r\nhydrous silica more or less crystalline. These concretions are described\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that nearly all the districts in which the silicified\r\ncorals and concretions, siliceous minerals, and limonite occur, are\r\nscantily vegetated “talasinga” lands[138] with reddish soil. Except in\r\nthe instance of the Kalikoso plains, the swamps and lakes have as a rule\r\nlong since disappeared, their sites being alone indicated by the\r\nlimonite on the surface. In the Mbua plains, however, there are\r\noccasional small ponds and swamps, and there is no doubt that the\r\nlimonite so bountifully represented on the dry districts is still in\r\nprocess of formation.\r\n\r\nBefore drawing some general inferences as to the conditions under which\r\nthis deposition of silica and iron took place, I will refer to the\r\ncharacters of the materials thus produced.\r\n\r\nThe silicified corals include massive corals of the Astraean and\r\n“Porites” kinds and branching specimens of the Madrepore type or habit.\r\nThe former are rarely larger than 7 or 8 inches across and are merely\r\nfragments. The latter are always portions of branches, never exceeding 3\r\nor 4 inches in length. In the last case it is sometimes possible to\r\nshow, as in the case of a specimen found on the Kalikoso plains, that\r\nbefore silicification occurred the dead fragment of branching coral had\r\nbeen extensively eroded by solvent agencies and had been penetrated by\r\nburrowing molluscs. The larger blocks of massive corals have usually\r\nbeen extensively chipped by the natives in obtaining flints. In past\r\ntimes they were carried from one place to another, the result being that\r\noccasionally they were brought to me in the mountain-villages, all\r\nshowing evidence of their having supplied flints to a past generation.\r\n\r\nThese corals are as a rule completely silicified. When a massive\r\nspecimen is broken across it is not infrequently found that whilst the\r\ncoral structure is preserved in its outer part, the inner portion is\r\ncomposed of a compact seemingly structureless mass of bluish-white or\r\npale-grey flint, which has the characteristic microscopical appearance\r\nof chalcedony and a specific gravity of 2·59.[139] It is from the more\r\ncompact parts of the silicified massive corals that the “worked” flints\r\nfound on the surface were obtained, though in some of them, as in the\r\ncase of a “scraper” in my collection, the traces of coral structure are\r\nstill apparent to the eye. Wichmann observed in the case of the\r\nsilicified corals from Fiji that the whole petrifying process appears to\r\nconsist in the saturation of the coral with silica, the coral structure\r\nbeing usually distinct, whilst the septa, often still calcitic, show the\r\npoints of the calcite crystals projecting into the chalcedony which\r\nforms the mass. Lime however rarely occurs in the silicified corals of\r\nVanua Levu. It was only in the case of one or two localities that the\r\ncorals displayed any effervescence with an acid. In the microscope slide\r\nthe massive specimens appear to be entirely of chalcedonic silica, the\r\noutlines of the cells and of the septa being indicated by ferruginous\r\nmaterial. In a specimen of Porites by my side the crystallization of the\r\nsilica has advanced beyond the chalcedonic stage and the coral is\r\ncomposed entirely of minute quartz-crystals, ·2 to ·4 mm. in size, often\r\nirregular, but sometimes forming doubly-terminated prisms. This has\r\nproduced a somewhat crumbling rock, which is easily powdered by the\r\nfinger; and in this case, therefore, the complete crystallization of the\r\nsilica is resulting in the disintegration of the silicified coral.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary silicified massive corals of Vanua Levu, where the\r\nreplacement by chalcedonic silica is complete, though the structure is\r\npreserved, have a hardness of about 6 and a specific gravity of 2·54,\r\nand yield but little water in the closed tube. Occasionally, however, as\r\nin the Sarawanga plains and in the Lekutu lowlands we find silicified\r\nfragments of branching corals which are easily scratched with a knife\r\nand have a hardness of 3 to 4 and a specific gravity of 2·3. The\r\nfractured surface is milk-white or reddish, and looks like semi-opal.\r\nWhen powdered and heated in a closed tube, the material loses one fourth\r\nor one fifth of its weight of water, the finest dust (passing away in\r\nthe steam) being deposited on the sides of the glass. In the slide there\r\nis displayed a finely granular crypto-crystalline structure with in\r\nplaces a somewhat coarser quartz-mosaic, whilst chalcedonic quartz fills\r\nminute cracks in the mass. No coral structure is preserved. Numerous\r\npoints coloured by iron oxide occur in the section, and minute dust-like\r\ninclusions abound, which are doubtless water-pores. I have described on\r\na later page certain concretions found associated with these silicified\r\ncorals which though formed of the same crypto-crystalline hydrous\r\nsilica, are apparently silicified portions of nullipore-rocks.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of flint that occur commonly on the surface in these\r\ndistricts are, as above remarked, derived from the hard silicified\r\ncoral-masses. Nodules of chalcedony, having all the appearance of having\r\noriginated in cavities, are also very frequent. They may take the\r\nmamillary, agate, or onyx form, some of the agates when polished making\r\nbeautiful specimens. These nodules are of all sizes up to 3 or 4 inches\r\nacross. Some of them are hollow and lined with clear quartz-crystals,\r\nwhilst with others the cavity may be completely filled by interlocking\r\nquartz-crystals. The outer surface of one of the agates displays\r\nmarkings showing in relief casts of the “cups” of a minute-celled coral.\r\n\r\nMingled with the other siliceous materials on the surface of the\r\nKalikoso and Lambasa plains are found fragments of a whitish\r\nquartz-rock, having a specific gravity of 2·53-2·57, being therefore\r\nmarkedly lighter than quartzite (2·63-2·67) which it somewhat resembles.\r\nIt usually occurs as small hand-specimens; but in the vicinity of\r\nMbati-ni-kama I found blocks, 12 to 15 inches across, lying in the\r\nriver-bed. Under the microscope it displays a fine radio-globular\r\naggregate of chalcedonic quartz.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the siliceous concretions, composed\r\nmainly of hydrous crypto-crystalline silica, which are associated with\r\nthe silicified coral fragments formed of the same kind of silica on the\r\nsurface of the plains of Mbua, Lekutu, and Sarawanga. They also occur in\r\nthe Ndranimako lowlands on the right side of the Yanawai estuary, and in\r\nthe more elevated inland districts of the Wainunu and Na Savu\r\ntable-lands at elevations of 650 to 770 feet above the sea. They take\r\nthe form of irregular nodules, or of flat uneven “cakes,” usually two or\r\nthree inches in size. They are as a rule reddish, but sometimes pink and\r\nwhite. Their hardness is only 3 to 4, and they are easily scratched with\r\na knife; and when powdered and heated in a closed tube, they lose about\r\none fourth of their weight of water. Under the microscope they exhibit a\r\ngrey crypto-crystalline groundmass showing very finely granular\r\ncrystalline silica with the cracks and small cavities filled with more\r\nbrightly polarising chalcedonic quartz. But they differ as regards their\r\nother components and also in their mode of occurrence; and it is highly\r\nprobable that the history of their origin is not always the same.\r\n\r\nThose associated with the silicified corals on the Sarawanga and Lekutu\r\nlowlands show no structure in the slide that gives me a clue as to their\r\norigin; but they may perhaps represent old Nullipore nodules. Those\r\naround Ndranimako are coloured deep red; and whilst some give no\r\nindication as to their source, others are transitional in character, and\r\ndisplay in the sections traces of the vacuolar semi-vitreous basic rock\r\nof which the original fragment was composed. The same red siliceous\r\nconcretions form the pebbles and gravel in the stream-beds on the\r\nsurface of the Na Savu table-land, 700 feet above the sea. These red\r\nflint-like nodules of Ndranimako and Na Savu somewhat resemble the\r\njasper of the island; but they are sharply distinguished by their\r\nmicroscopic characters, by being easily scratched with a knife, and by\r\nthe large amount of water which they contain. Rolled stones, which were\r\nfound in the shallow stream-courses on the surface of the Wainunu\r\ntable-land 750 to 800 feet above the sea, exhibit in the sections, in\r\nspite of the general silicification of the groundmass, the outlines of\r\nthe original phenocrysts of felspar, and abundant skeletal magnetite\r\nrods, such as would characterise a semi-vitreous basic rock. It is\r\nevident that in the basaltic districts of the Na Savu and Wainunu\r\ntable-lands these concretions have been formed under certain conditions\r\nby the decomposition of the silicates of basic rocks. But these\r\nconditions do not exist now; and I infer that the silicified rocks,\r\nwhich occur only in fragments on the surface, represent the\r\nsilicification that occurred during the emergence of the land ages\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one comes upon in the mountain districts, as in the\r\nvicinity of Ndrawa, large solitary blocks 2 to 4 feet across of a\r\nwhitish chert-like rock which has a hardness of 5 or 6, the harder\r\nvariety having a specific gravity of about 2·58 and the softer, which\r\nyields a fair amount of water, a specific gravity of about 2·46. I\r\nnoticed such solitary masses also on the Mbua plains. The first-named\r\nlocality is dacitic and the last basaltic. They exhibit in the slides a\r\npatchy appearance, showing in some places finely granular\r\ncrypto-crystalline silica and in others a coarser mosaic of chalcedonic\r\nquartz. Apart from the absence of any definite coral structure, I can\r\nonly surmise that they were originally masses of reef-limestone. Their\r\nelevation even in the mountainous districts was not over 400 or 500 feet\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nFragments of jasper, which are associated with nodules of chalcedony and\r\nsilicified corals in the Lambasa plains, are also to be found as pebbles\r\nand small blocks in the mountain streams of the Ndrawa, Ndrandramea, and\r\nLea districts, together with bits of chalcedony and quartz-crystals.\r\nThey do not occur, or are of rare occurrence, in the recently emerged\r\nKalikoso district and probably belong to an earlier stage in the history\r\nof the island’s emergence from the sea. They have a hardness of 6 to 7,\r\nnot being scratched by a knife, and a specific gravity of 2·65 to 2·70;\r\nwhilst but little water is given off in the closed tube. They are a\r\nvariety of chalcedony, rendered opaque by the large quantity of red\r\noxide of iron that it contains, and are really, therefore, iron-flints.\r\nThe microscopical section in one case displays in the clear spaces a\r\nbeautiful globular aggregate, each globule having a nucleus of the iron\r\noxide and giving a black cross in polarised light. In another case the\r\nglobular structure is less perfect, and the chalcedonic groundmass is\r\npenetrated by a multitude of fine cracks filled with iron oxide.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of limonite vary in character in different localities, and\r\nevidently they have not all the same history. The soil of the low-lying\r\nplains around Wai-ni-koro and Kalikoso, and especially in the vicinity\r\nof the fresh-water lake, is often coloured a deep ochreous red. Small\r\nfragments of an earthy yellowish-brown limonite occur on the surface in\r\nquantity and are particularly abundant near the lake. They yield much\r\nwater when heated. In some places in this district, as in the country\r\ntraversed between Wai-ni-koro and Kalikoso, the surface is strewn with a\r\nnumber of small round concretions of the size of small marbles (6 to\r\n12 mm.) which are composed of a mixture of carbonate of iron and\r\nlimonite, but show no recognisable structures. They are somewhat friable\r\nand give off much water when heated, whilst they effervesce freely in\r\nhot hydrochloric acid. It is probable that some of the earthy limonite\r\nof the Kalikoso district contained originally iron carbonate and has\r\nbeen produced from concretions such as I have just described.\r\n\r\nThe variety of limonite found in fragments on the surface of the plains\r\nof Mbua, Lekutu, and Sarawanga, at elevations usually of 100 or 200 feet\r\nabove the sea, is a heavy compact kind with a specific gravity of 3 to\r\n3·5, and closely resembling red hematite. Since, however, it is lighter\r\nin weight and still contains a little water, it may be regarded as in\r\nthe transition stage. It occurs as portions of cake-like masses varying\r\nusually from a third of an inch to rather over an inch in thickness. As\r\na rule it is found in localities where no lakes or swamps now exist and\r\nmay be associated, as in the Sarawanga and Lekutu plains, with\r\nsilicified corals and siliceous concretions; but in some cases, as in\r\nthat of the Mbua plains, ponds and swamps are still scantily represented\r\nin the vicinity, and the water of the stagnant streams is deeply\r\ncoloured with iron (see page 56).\r\n\r\nIronstone gravel occurs in great quantity strewn over the surface of the\r\nbasaltic table-lands, especially in the case of that between the Wainunu\r\nand the Yanawai rivers. The smaller gravel varies usually between one\r\neighth and one third of an inch in size, the larger fragments being\r\nabout an inch. The specific gravity is 3·1 to 3·2. The material forming\r\nthe finer gravel dissolves with but little effervescence and scanty\r\nresidue in hot hydrochloric acid; it gives off water and is evidently\r\nimpure limonite. The larger fragments, 1 to 2 inches in size, represent\r\nthe partial conversion into limonite of a basic volcanic rock with much\r\nglass in the groundmass which formed probably the surface of the\r\nbasaltic flows of the plateaux. There must be an enormous amount of this\r\niron-stone in the island. The finer gravel has a concretionary\r\ncharacter, some of the pieces appearing like bits of stick that have\r\nbeen converted into limonite. It seems to have been formed during the\r\ndisintegration of the rock on the moist surface of these densely wooded\r\nbasaltic plateaux; the process was not accomplished in ponds or swamps,\r\nbut was carried out on ordinary damp ground.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed in the above connection that the soil in the areas\r\nof basalt and basaltic andesites, which occupy a large portion of the\r\nsurface of the island, contains a large amount of fine magnetic\r\niron-sand. After heavy rains the foot paths glisten with this fine\r\nmaterial which has been washed out on the ground. This is especially the\r\ncase in the extensive scantily vegetated “talasinga” regions where the\r\nbasaltic rocks are disintegrating for a considerable depth. The\r\nriver-sand of these areas, after a little washing, yields about 75 per\r\ncent. of magnetic iron grains which give in some cases a slight titanium\r\nreaction. The amount of magnetic iron-sand in these rivers, as for\r\ninstance in the Yanawai and the Wainunu, must be very great. In the beds\r\nof the small sluggish streams on the surface of the Wainunu table-land\r\nthe amount is also very large.\r\n\r\nAny explanation of the origin of the extensive silicification evidenced\r\nby the occurrence of silicified corals and siliceous concretions on the\r\nsurface in various parts of the lower regions of the island will have to\r\ninclude that of the formation of the limonite fragments so often\r\naccompanying them. The necessary conditions would, I think, be afforded\r\nby an emerging land-surface during the consolidation of the exposed\r\ncalcareous muds and the subsequent draining of the new surface. On parts\r\nof the newly formed land, there would follow the successive stages of\r\nsea-water, brackish, and fresh-water swamps, such as are clearly\r\nindicated by the abundance of silicified coral fragments that strew the\r\nsurface of the low-lying and often swampy districts around the fresh\r\nwater lake of Kalikoso.\r\n\r\nIn such a locality as that of Kalikoso, there were no doubt at the time\r\nof the emergence large tracts covered with chalky calcareous mud derived\r\nfrom reef-debris; and it was during the consolidation of this mud in the\r\nrecently reclaimed area that the fragments of coral imbedded in it\r\nbecame silicified. In these cases where the imbedded corals were already\r\nmuch decayed, it is probable that the empty cavities thus produced were\r\nfilled with silica, and that in this manner the nodules of chalcedony\r\nwere produced. Here and there a pebble or a larger block of a volcanic\r\nrock would have been inclosed in the mud; and in this case also silica\r\nlargely replaced the original material of the stone. I imagine that with\r\nthe evaporation of the water in the mud during the drying and\r\nconsolidating processes the proportion of silica in solution would\r\nattain a degree of super-saturation and that the silicification would\r\nhence be brought about.\r\n\r\nWith the consolidation of the mud the deposition of silica ceased; and\r\nin the case of any coral fragments, where the transformation was not\r\ncompleted, decay would often commence. In the instance of some bits of\r\ncoral found imbedded in foraminiferous mud-rock in the Lambasa plains\r\nthe process of the change had been suspended, and the fragments were in\r\na state of decay, and coloured red by iron oxide. If silicification\r\noccurred in a submarine deposit only after it became a portion of an old\r\nland-surface we ought not to find incompletely silicified corals\r\ninclosed in it. For these reasons I do not consider that silicification\r\nwould occur in the case of submarine deposits long after they have been\r\nraised above the sea.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it would seem that the deposition of silica in the\r\nhard parts of dead organisms does not proceed in the shallow-water\r\ncalcareous mud of coral reef coasts previous to emergence. Silicified\r\ncorals have never as far as I know been found under such conditions. Nor\r\ncould the coral fragments now lying on the Kalikoso plains, often only\r\nelevated some 20 or 30 feet above the sea, have undergone this change\r\nwhilst exposed on the land-surface as they now lie. They must have been\r\ninclosed in some material containing abundant free silica; and it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that this material was the chalky mud of the\r\nreef-flats on which they once lived. If this is admitted, then it\r\nfollows that since, as above assumed, silicification does not occur in\r\nsuch a mud either before upheaval or long after it has been raised above\r\nthe sea, it must take place in the intermediate period, or in other\r\nwords whilst the recently exposed submarine deposits are consolidating\r\nand drying.\r\n\r\nSeveral objections at once occur with reference to this explanation of\r\nthe silicification of corals in this island; but much more investigation\r\nis needed to establish any view on the subject. In the Kalikoso plains,\r\nhowever, we have a critical locality for the pursuit of this inquiry.\r\nConcretions of carbonate of iron and deposits of earthy limonite are\r\nhere associated with silicified corals on the surface of a level and\r\noften swampy district around a freshwater lake in a region which is only\r\nelevated 20 to 60 feet above the sea. We are dealing here with an area\r\nof land that has emerged in comparatively recent times as far as the\r\nhistory of the island is concerned. The element of time is limited, and\r\nthe problem is not complicated, as it would be in the case of an old\r\nland-surface, raised some hundreds of feet above the sea, by the\r\nintrusion of many other disturbing agencies. Nature has simplified\r\nmatters here for the inquirer.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of recent emergence with regard to the whole island is\r\ndiscussed in Chapter II., and need not be again referred to here; whilst\r\nthe general description of the Kalikoso district is given in Chapter\r\nXVI. In this connection it may be remarked that before their emergence\r\nthe Kalikoso plains were covered by the waters of a large irregular\r\nsea-water lagoon or lake, which though more or less surrounded by hills\r\nhad free communication with the sea on the north along the line of the\r\npassages now occupied by the Wai-ni-koro and Langa-langa rivers. Both\r\nmassive and branching corals then thrived in the waters of the lagoon.\r\nThere is no ground for supposing that during the emergence there was an\r\nintermediate stage characterised by brine-ponds and salt-swamps. The\r\ndrainage from the slopes of the mountains to the southward would have\r\nprevented it. Whilst this change of level was in operation, brackish\r\nwater collected in the deeper part of the original lagoon, forming a\r\nlake which as evidenced by the present distribution of limonite on the\r\nsurface of the plains was then far larger than it is now. As the plains\r\nbecame exposed large flats covered with chalky mud in which dead corals\r\nwere more or less imbedded were bared; and there and then as the drying\r\nand consolidation proceeded silicification took place in the manner\r\nbefore surmised. This deposit was of no great thickness, and has been\r\nsince removed by the denuding agencies, whilst the silicified corals\r\nremain behind.\r\n\r\nWhen in the Solomon Islands I was unable to find the source of the\r\nchalcedonic worked flints of such frequent occurrence in that region. In\r\nmy general work on those islands (pp. 77 to 80) reference is made to\r\nthis subject. It will probably be shown that there as in Fiji most of\r\nthe flints are silicified corals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be remarked that those who object to the\r\nexplanation of the origin of silicified corals advanced in this chapter\r\nwill be able to find support for their alternative hypothesis in many\r\nfacts detailed in these pages. Vanua Levu, for instance, abounds in hot\r\nsprings; and Mr. Andrews might regard this fact as giving strength to\r\nhis view that the silicified corals of Vanua Mbalavu in this group owe\r\ntheir condition to the agency of superheated water derived from volcanic\r\nrocks, more especially since hot springs are found on the island. Such\r\nan explanation could not, I think, apply to the extensive area of the\r\nKalikoso plains where the silicified corals are associated with limonite\r\non the surface of a recently emerged area. If these changes had been\r\ninduced by hydrothermal action, one ought to find evidence of this in\r\nthose localities in Vanua Levu where the hot springs issue from\r\nforaminiferous clay deposits, as in the vicinity of Vuni-moli; but no\r\ntraces of such a transformation came under my notice. Wichmann does not\r\nadvance any explanation of the silicification of the corals; but he\r\nconsiders that the “hornstones,” which he obtained from Fiji, rocks\r\ncorresponding to the chert-like rocks described by me on page 355, are\r\nthe products of disintegration of the basic andesites. I have already\r\npointed out that certain siliceous nodules have probably this origin. It\r\nis also likely that some of the jasper of Vanua Levu has been thus\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note on a silicified Fern Rhizome._—This is a specimen, about three\r\ninches long, picked up by a native in a stream near Sueni in the centre\r\nof the island. It has the appearance of being a portion of the stem or\r\nrhizome of a tree-fern, and is permeated in its entirety by chalcedonic\r\nquartz, the fibro-cellular structure being still preserved. No other\r\nspecimen of the kind came under my notice. The probability of the\r\noccurrence of silicified plant-remains in the pumice-tuffs of the Undu\r\nPromontory is pointed out on page 233.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                             MAGNETIC ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE literature on the subject of the magnetism of rocks is very\r\nextensive,[140] and even if I was capable of doing so, any attempt to\r\ndeal generally with this complicated phenomenon would be out of place\r\nhere. Zirkel in his characteristically thorough fashion has reviewed the\r\nsubject in his general work on petrography, but since the date of the\r\nlast publication of that book, 1893-94, the literature has been much\r\nincreased and the subject has from time to time been opened up in\r\nscientific periodicals, occasionally in ignorance of the labours of\r\nthose that have gone before. Here, the local magnetisation of rocks is\r\nalone considered, the general question of earth magnetism not being\r\nentered into.\r\n\r\nAccording to Zirkel one of the earliest known observations of this\r\nphenomenon was made by Bouguer, the French geographer, whilst he was\r\nengaged in the measurement of a degree of the meridian in the vicinity\r\nof Quito in 1742. Alexander von Humboldt, however, was one of the first\r\nto attract general attention to this subject by the announcement of his\r\ndiscovery in 1796 of a “great magnetic mountain” in the heart of\r\nGermany. He was then director-general of the mines in two Franconian\r\nprincipalities; and in order to awaken the interest of German physicists\r\nand mineralogists in this matter, he announced his discovery with an air\r\nof mystery, and did not disclose the locality for many months. He then\r\nplaced his specimens in the mining-office at Bayreuth to be sold at so\r\nmuch by weight for the relief of poor miners. His plan succeeded, and\r\nthis young savant who had yet before him his great career, had soon\r\nenlisted the interests of several of the noted scientific men in\r\nGermany, including Werner the mineralogist, Voigt the mathematician,\r\nBlumenbach the naturalist, Charpentier, and others. The amount of\r\nattention that this subject then excited can be inferred from the pages\r\nof the “Intelligenzblatt der Allgemeine Literatur-zeitung” for 1796-1797\r\nand from the contemporary publications. It has been almost forgotten\r\nnow, and the matter is indeed often approached “de novo.”\r\n\r\nHowever, although by these means the data became largely increased, no\r\ngenerally accepted explanation resulted. Opposing views continued at\r\nvarious times to be advanced; and it has only in recent years come to be\r\nrecognised that the magnetic polarity[141] of rocks in exposed\r\nsituations, as in the mountain-peak or in the crested spur, often arises\r\nfrom atmospheric electricity independently of the inductive action of\r\nterrestrial magnetism. This is the conclusion to which the later\r\nevidence given by Zirkel is directed and was that which Oddone and Sella\r\nformed from their study of the magnetic rocks of the Central Alps. It is\r\nnot, however, always necessary to suppose that the affected rocks have\r\nbeen struck by lightning, although Sella and Folgheraiter have shown\r\nthat this is the result of such a contact. They may be found, as\r\nindicated by Mr. Harker, in mountainous localities where thunder-storms\r\nare remarkably rare, and where the peaks act, it is suggested, as\r\nnatural conductors. It is easy to show, remarks the same author, that no\r\nlapse of time is required for rocks in exposed situations to become\r\nmagnetised. The stones of cairns erected a few years before on the\r\nmountain-tops of the Isle of Skye become invariably highly magnetic;\r\nwhilst the loose stones lying on the ground display this property to a\r\nmuch less degree. Nor is it requisite that the rocks affected should be\r\nbasic volcanic rocks. It has long been known that granites, trachytes,\r\n&c., can possess magnetic polarity[142]; and the existence of this\r\nquality among acid volcanic rocks is well shown in the case of the\r\ndacites in Vanua Levu, rocks which compose some of the isolated\r\nmountain-peaks.\r\n\r\nOne finds occasional reference to the highly magnetic character of the\r\nrocks in oceanic islands of volcanic origin, but the nature of the\r\nproperty is not always described; and it is sometimes not possible to\r\ngather from the data given whether the magnetism affects the whole\r\nmountain mass, when it would be of the regional kind, due probably to\r\ninduction, or whether it is the simple magnetic quality that almost all\r\nbasic volcanic rocks possess on account of the fine magnetite\r\ndisseminated through the rock, or whether there is evidence of a deposit\r\nof magnetite in the vicinity, or whether it is a mere surface phenomenon\r\nconfined to the bare rocks of peaks and ridges, when such rocks, whether\r\ngabbro, granite, basalt, trachyte, or dacite, display magnetic polarity.\r\nDana, with regard to the basaltic mountain of Tahiti, remarks that the\r\ncompass was often rendered useless by the local attraction of the rocks,\r\nbearings taken being found to vary two to three points on changing the\r\nposition of the instrument.[143] Major Haig says that the compass\r\nbecomes perfectly useless anywhere in the neighbourhood of one of the\r\nmountain-masses or extinct craters in Mauritius, and attributes this\r\neffect to the magnetite in the basalt.[144]\r\n\r\nOn the summit of Mauna Loa in Hawaii, at the edge of the great crater\r\nand in the vicinity of the site where Commodore Wilkes carried out his\r\npendulum observations in 1840, I found my compass-needle greatly\r\naffected by local attraction, but I neglected to inquire further into\r\nthe matter. Judging from my sojourn of twenty-three days on this\r\nmountain-top, thunder-storms are of very rare occurrence there; but the\r\nelectric condition of the air is at times very evident, and its\r\nphysiological effects are somewhat distressing. My blanket at night\r\ncrackled in my hands and emitted sparks, so that I could trace with my\r\nfinger the letter A in phosphorescent hues on its surface.\r\n\r\nThat lightning is directly responsible in some instances for the\r\nmagnetic polarity of rocks in mountain-peaks is also well established.\r\nIt has been illustrated in an indirect fashion only last year in the\r\ndisaster on the Wetterhorn. Rocks partially fused by thunderbolts and\r\ndisplaying polarity occur on the summit of the Riffelhorn and on one of\r\nthe peaks of Monte Rosa, and fulgurites have been also obtained from\r\nMont Blanc.... It is not always easy to explain, however, isolated cases\r\nof polaric rocks where no signs of fusion occur. Whilst descending into\r\nthe Valle del Bove from the Etna Observatory, I picked up four small\r\nvolcanic bombs of basic lava, of which one displayed polarity, the poles\r\nbeing situated at the sides of the bomb. Zirkel quotes the observation\r\nof Naumann on the summit of the volcano of Moryoshi in Japan. Here out\r\nof a number of lava-blocks lying about only one exhibited marked\r\npolarity, whilst the rest showed no signs of it.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with the polaric rocks of Vanua Levu, I will refer to two\r\nlocalities in other parts of the group where magnetic rocks have been\r\nobserved. During the Wilkes’ expedition in 1840,[145] Lieutenant\r\nUnderwood observed great local attraction at Naikovu, a rock 90 feet\r\nhigh of volcanic formation lying off the south end of Nairai Island. He\r\nfound a “deviation” of 13¼ points (149 degrees) at the top of the rock,\r\nwhilst at the foot near the water the needle gave correct bearings. In\r\nthe _Sailing Directions for the Pacific Islands_, published in 1900, the\r\n“deflection” at the summit is said to be 87 degrees. It is stated by Mr.\r\nEakle in his paper (quoted on p. 293) on the rocks collected by the\r\nrecent Agassiz expedition that this rock is composed of an\r\naugite-andesite.... I have learned from Mr. Alex. Barrack that there are\r\nsome highly magnetic rocks on the west coast of Viti Levu in the\r\nvicinity of Likuri Harbour in the Nandronga district. It is said that\r\nspecimens sent down to the colonies were found to contain 95 per cent.\r\nof magnetite.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that the results obtained by me for Vanua Levu can\r\nbe generally applied to the other large islands of the group. The\r\nobservations were made during my various geological journeys and deal\r\nonly with certain aspects of this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nThe first feature in this connection is the frequency with which simple\r\nmagnetism is displayed by the acid as well as basic volcanic rocks of\r\nthis island. About 95 per cent. of the volcanic rocks collected attract\r\nboth ends of the needle.[146] This property of volcanic rocks is well\r\nknown, and is to be attributed to the magnetite in the groundmass.[147]\r\nOn examining the character of the non-magnetic rocks it appears that\r\nalmost all belong to two groups where magnetite might be expected to be\r\nscanty. The first includes the pitchstones or basic glasses, sometimes\r\nfresh, at other times more or less palagonitised. The second comprises\r\nthe highly altered basic rocks, where the ferro-magnesian silicates have\r\nbeen replaced by viridite, calcite, and pyrites. It is not, however, to\r\nbe implied that rocks of these two kinds will not sometimes attract the\r\nneedle. Many do not, and those in my collection that do so act feebly.\r\n\r\nComing to the magnetic polarity displayed by some of these rocks, when\r\nthe ordinary hand-specimen behaves like a magnet in attracting one pole\r\nof the needle and repelling the other, it is to be at first observed\r\nthat a rock can become polaric without being previously magnetic. Dr.\r\nFolgheraiter has observed polarity in the case of fragments of ancient\r\nbricks and pottery; and he has described the same effect in the masonry\r\nof a house struck by lightning. In one or two of the Vanua Levu acid\r\nrocks showing polarity this can be also premised since magnetite is\r\npresent in very slight degree.\r\n\r\nPolarity is very frequent among the volcanic rocks of this island. Out\r\nof 520 specimens in my collection, which was made without any reference\r\nto this matter, 80, or 15 per cent. are polaric. Of these seven-eighths\r\nare basic and the rest are acid rocks; but this proportion is partly\r\naccounted for by the far greater prevalence of basic rocks in the\r\nisland. The basic rocks showing polarity include some of the heaviest\r\nolivine-basalts with a specific weight of 3·0, as well as some of the\r\nlighter augite-andesites with specific weight of 2·7. They comprise the\r\ncoarse textured dolerite as well as the vitreous pitchstone and include\r\nboth scoriaceous and amygdaloidal rocks. The polaric acid rocks are\r\nmostly referable to the dacites, with a specific gravity of 2·5 to 2·6.\r\n\r\nHumboldt remarked long ago that there is no direct relation between the\r\ndegree of polarity and the specific weight. This is well brought out in\r\nthe table subjoined; but it should be at once observed that there is an\r\nindirect relation. Although when we arrange the rocks in a series\r\naccording to their specific weight we find no corresponding relation in\r\nthe amounts of the polarity, we observe that the extent to which\r\npolarity can be developed is markedly greater in basic than in acid\r\nrocks. From this it may be inferred that the degree of intensity of the\r\nexciting cause required to give polaric powers of a certain value to an\r\nacid rock, like a dacite, would be much greater than that necessary to\r\nendow a basalt with equal powers. We should not expect to find the same\r\namount of polarity in the bare rocky peaks of two adjacent mountains,\r\nwhere one was of dacite and the other of basalt; and, other things being\r\nequal, if two mountains had been exposed for ages to the same\r\nconditions, we should regard the polaric powers of the two as nature’s\r\nequivalent values for the work of atmospheric electricity, on the two\r\nrocks in question. We have two such mountains in Vanua Levu in the case\r\nof the adjacent peaks of Ngaingai (2,448 feet) and Navuningumu (1,931\r\nfeet) which are about 2¼ miles apart and possess similar bare rocky\r\npointed summits. I take it that the polaric power of 25° of the dacite\r\n(sp. gr. 2·57) in the first case is equal to the power of 90° of the\r\nbasaltic andesite (sp. gr. 2·82) in the other. In the dacitic peak of\r\nNgaingai and in the basaltic peak of Navuningumu we can measure what\r\nwork atmospheric electricity can accomplish in the course of ages in the\r\nmagnetisation of rocks. The other conditions being taken as about the\r\nsame, the main determining difference is to be found in the\r\nrock-characters.\r\n\r\nIn the table on the opposite page we have a series of volcanic rocks\r\nplaced according to their specific weights, which range from 2·5 to 3·0,\r\nand in the second column are shown their relative polaric powers as\r\nindicated by the number of degrees the north end of the magnetic needle\r\nis repelled by the corresponding pole in the hand-specimen. For this\r\npurpose a magnetic needle 2½ inches in length (strictly speaking 6·5\r\ncentimetres) was employed, a card marked in degrees being placed\r\nbeneath. The north pole of the stone was placed in contact with the\r\nnorth end of the needle, and after the needle had become stationary in\r\nits new position a reading was taken.\r\n\r\nThese polaric rocks came under my notice over most of the island. They\r\nare infrequent in the district between Undu Point and the Wai-ni-koro\r\nRiver, where, however, acid tuffs are largely exposed; and I did not\r\nfind them in the Natewa Peninsula east of Lea, their absence from my\r\ncollections made in the Mount Freeland range being remarkable. But it is\r\nprobable that this is due to the surface conditions, since dense wood\r\ncovers the slopes, and bare rocky peaks are rarely to be seen.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the influence of locality on the occurrence of polaric\r\nrocks, the results may thus be classified. About one-third are found in\r\nthe exposed rocky peaks of hills and mountains. Another third are found\r\nwhere the rocks are bared in headlands, coast cliffs, inland-bluffs,\r\nridge-tops, and in the open basaltic plains where trees are scanty. On\r\nthe other hand, a third occur in situations, as in wooded districts\r\nwhere the rock exposure is scanty, when it is not easy to explain the\r\npolarity, unless it was developed in clear districts that have since\r\nbecome covered with forest.\r\n\r\n    _Table showing the Relation between the Specific Gravity and the\r\n                      Polarity of Volcanic Rocks._\r\n\r\n +---------------------+--------------------+------------------------+\r\n |Character of rock.   |  Specific gravity. |Amount of polarity.[148]|\r\n +---------------------+--------------------+------------------------+\r\n |                     |                    |                        |\r\n |Dark olivine-basalt  |         3·00       |          10°           |\r\n |Grey    \"      \"     |         2·94       |          29°           |\r\n |  \"     \"      \"     |         2·92       |           7°           |\r\n |Dark    \"      \"     |         2·90       |          10°           |\r\n |  \"     \"      \"     |         2·87       |          30°           |\r\n |Basaltic andesite    |         2·82       |          90°           |\r\n |   \"        \"        |         2·77       |           5°           |\r\n |Pyroxene-andesite    |         2·72       |          38°           |\r\n |Dacite               |         2·61       |          17°           |\r\n |  \"                  |         2·59       |           5°           |\r\n |  \"                  |         2·57       |          25°           |\r\n |  \"                  |         2·50       |          14°           |\r\n +---------------------+--------------------+------------------------+\r\n\r\nIn no place did any evidence of the direct action of lightning come\r\nunder my notice. Mr. S. Skinner who kindly looked at a few of these\r\nrocks says that he found no trace of fulgurites in them. It is probable\r\nthat here as in the mountains of Skye, as described by Mr. Harker, these\r\neffects are the result of the general influence of atmospheric\r\nelectricity independently of the direct agency of lightning. The\r\nfrequency of polaric rocks in the highest peaks of the island is very\r\nremarkable. Generally speaking, all the bare summits of the mountains\r\nare polaric. In my experience there is no exception. All the rocks\r\nobtained from the actual summits show polarity. The variety of rocks\r\nthus affected is suggestive; and this chapter may be concluded with a\r\nbrief reference to their mode of occurrence on some of the\r\nmountain-peaks.\r\n\r\nIn Mbatini, 3,437 feet in height, which is the highest mountain of Vanua\r\nLevu, the pyroxene-andesite of which the bare rocky peak is composed is\r\nsomewhat weathered and has a polaric or repellent power of 28°.\r\nSpecimens of rock obtained below the top show no polarity, the mountain\r\nbeing well wooded except at the summit. In the adjacent mountain of\r\nKoro-mbasanga,[149] the polaric rocks are limited to those exposed in\r\nthe peak which is bared of vegetation. The rocks in question are\r\ntuff-agglomerates, the small blocks of pyroxene-andesite standing out\r\nfrom the tuff having a polaric force of 14° or 15°. This effect has been\r\nproduced in greatest intensity in the isolated peak of Navuningumu\r\n(1,931 feet) in the Ndrandramea region. Here the bare summit is formed\r\nof a semi-vitreous, slightly vesicular, basaltic andesite with a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·82 in its present condition.[150] This rock is\r\npowerfully polaric, and rendered the compass useless, the deviation\r\ngenerally to the westward varying from 20° to 50°. I place its repellent\r\nforce at about 90°, hand specimens affecting the magnetic needle at a\r\ndistance of 13 or 14 inches. None of the various rocks obtained from the\r\nwooded slopes below displayed polarity.\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring mountain of Ngaingai is composed entirely of dacite\r\nhaving a specific weight of 2·57. The highest point of the summit, 2,448\r\nfeet above the sea, is bare and rocky, and the stone here is markedly\r\npolaric, the repellent force being about 25°. Specimens from the lower\r\nwooded slopes show no polarity. Near by rises the hill of Ndrandramea,\r\nwhich is composed in mass of acid andesites or dacitic rocks. The summit\r\n(1,800 feet) is scantily vegetated, and here the somewhat weathered rock\r\nwhich has a specific weight of 2·44 (probably near 2·5 in the fresh\r\ncondition) has a polaric force of 14°. Specimens of a more compact rock\r\ntaken from the wooded slopes 300 feet below the summit (sp. gr. 2·58)\r\nand from 700 feet below the top (sp. gr. 2·68) showed no such effect;\r\nbut a specimen taken from a mass of agglomerate in the last locality\r\nrepels the needle 12°. Its specific gravity is 2·61, and no doubt the\r\nmass had been originally a portion of an exposed cliff-face.[151]\r\n\r\nThe summit of Mariko (2,890 feet), the Drayton Peak of the chart, is\r\nformed of a rubbly agglomerate of a compact basic andesite. Though it\r\ndisplays bare rock-faces, the actual peak has a soil-cap at least 18\r\ninches deep and supports small trees and shrubs. Notwithstanding this, I\r\nfound when standing on the peak that my compass was very noticeably\r\naffected, the pull being to the eastward, whilst the amount of deviation\r\nincreased from 11° to 16° when changing from the sitting to the standing\r\nposition. Specimens of blocks from the agglomerate forming a rock-face\r\n10 feet below the summit possessed polaric powers of 12° and 5°. Others\r\nof the same rock exposed in a cliff-face 450 feet below had a weak\r\nrepellent power of only 4°.... As in the case of Mariko, the top of\r\nThambeyu (2,700 feet) is vegetated; and beneath the smaller trees blocks\r\nof polaric rocks lie on the surface. One of these, a pyroxene-andesite\r\n(sp. gr. 2·72), from which I obtained a specimen, has a polaric power of\r\n38°. In another case, that of an amygdaloidal rock of the same\r\ncharacter, the repellent power is 14°.\r\n\r\nI might mention several other polaric peaks, but it will be sufficient\r\nto refer to one or two other localities. In the mountainous basaltic\r\ndistrict around Solevu Bay the peaks are usually polaric. Specimens from\r\nthe top of Uli-i-matua, 1,100 feet, have a repellent power of 15°. The\r\nthree-peaked hill of Koro-tolu-tolu appears to be in the mass of polaric\r\nbasalt from the foot to the summit, having a repellent power varying\r\nfrom 4° to 30°, the most active specimens being obtained from the lower\r\nslopes, which, however, are scantily covered with trees. Samples of the\r\ngrey basalt from Koro-i-rea show polaric powers of 3° to 7°.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the numerous lesser hills with bare rocky polaric summits\r\nI will first take Bare-poll Hill facing Soni-soni Island. This hill is\r\nonly about 150 feet above the sea, its top being formed by two large\r\nmasses of a basic andesite lava with a glassy groundmass, incrusted with\r\nagglomerate, the whole representing a volcanic “neck.” A specimen of the\r\nrock masses has a repellent force of 22°. Another instance is afforded\r\nby Vatui, a hill 450 feet in height situated south of Mount Sesaleka.\r\nIts summit is capped by a naked mass of tuff-agglomerate pierced by a\r\ndyke 18 inches thick of an olivine-basalt, with a specific gravity of\r\n2·90 and a polaric power of 10°.\r\n\r\nA somewhat suggestive example is afforded by the hill of Na Suva-suva,\r\n1,110 feet high, which overlooks Naindi Harbour to the east of Savu-savu\r\nBay. It is only occupied by trees in its upper part, and a specimen of\r\nthe olivine-basalt, of which the hill is composed, that was obtained\r\nfrom the wooded summit, shows no polarity; whilst another from the\r\nslopes, two-thirds of the way up, which had been cleared of trees, has a\r\nrepellent force of 10°. The polarity of the olivine-basalt from the\r\nwell-wooded slopes of Ulu-i-ndali, a range 1,100 feet in height on the\r\neast side of the Wainunu estuary, is not so easily explained; the\r\nintensity varies from 8° to 28°. Ngalau-levu, a hill 1,650 feet in\r\nheight, rising behind Lea on the south coast of Natewa Bay, is polaric\r\nin its upper portion. Specimens of a hemicrystalline basic andesite,\r\nsomewhat scoriaceous, which form the agglomerate of the rocky summit,\r\nhave a repellent force of 18°, whilst a similar rock from the\r\nagglomerate of an exposed spur two-thirds of the way up the hill has a\r\nforce of as much as 38°. A curious case of polarity is exhibited in a\r\nbare tuff overlooking the Vui-na-Savu River between Rauriko and Vitina.\r\nIt is composed of a much weathered whitish trachytic rock, which in\r\nappearance affords no promise of polarity, but has the power of\r\nrepelling the magnetic needle 2° to 3°.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Note on the Average Polarity (Repellent Power) of the Volcanic\r\n                         Rocks of Vanua Levu._\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the table given below that the difference in the\r\naverage polarity of acid and basic rocks is not very great. The average\r\nfor rocks with a specific gravity below 2·7 is about 10°; and that for\r\nheavier rocks is about 14°. The difference mainly lies at the maximum\r\nend of each series, the capacity for extreme polarity being, as before\r\nremarked, markedly greater in the basic rocks.\r\n\r\n +-----------+------------------------+------------+-------------------+\r\n |           |                        |            |   Polarity.[152]  |\r\n | Specific  |  Character of rocks.   | Number of  +--------+----------+\r\n | gravity.  |                        | specimens. | Range. | Average. |\r\n +-----------+------------------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n | 2·50-2·59 | Dacites                |      6     | 2°-25° |  11·6°   |\r\n |           |                        |            |        |          |\r\n | 2·60-2·69 | Dacites and            |      5     | 3°-16° |   8·6°   |\r\n |           | augite-andesites       |            |        |          |\r\n |           |                        |            |        |          |\r\n | 2·70-2·79 | Augite-andesites       |      5     | 5°-38° |  13·2°   |\r\n |           |                        |            |        |          |\r\n | 2·80-2·89 | Basaltic andesites and |     18     | 3°-90° |  15·0°   |\r\n |           | olivine-basalts        |            |        |          |\r\n |           |                        |            |        |          |\r\n | 2·90-3·00 | Olivine-basalts        |     14     | 3°-29° |  12·7°   |\r\n +-----------+------------------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n\r\nIt is, however, noteworthy, as indicated by the value of the average in\r\neach series that not one of them is a good series. They form curves\r\nwhich in each case present an extreme maximum variant which is\r\nsuggestive of quite another degree of magnetising agency. This is also\r\nillustrated in the combined curve of all the results given above. The\r\nacid as well as the basic series are thus characterised, and the extreme\r\nmaximum variants are in each instance afforded by the highest mountain\r\npeaks. It is probable that there is an accelerating ratio of\r\nmagnetisation with increased elevation. However that may be, it appears\r\nevident from my observations on the two adjacent peaks of Ngaingai and\r\nNavuningumu that the limits of polarity acquired through atmospheric\r\nelectricity without the direct action of lightning would be, as measured\r\nby the scale here employed, four times as great for a dacite (25°) as\r\nfor a basaltic andesite (90°).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                  SOME CONCLUSIONS AND THEIR BEARINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nVANUA LEVU is a composite island built up during a long period of\r\nemergence, that began probably in the later Tertiary period, by the\r\nunion of a number of large and small islands of volcanic formation\r\nrepresenting the products of submarine eruptions. It differs in this\r\nrespect from Viti Levu which is much more massive in its profile and\r\npossesses a greater proportion of plutonic rocks. When, however, Viti\r\nLevu comes to be systematically examined, it is likely that traces of\r\nits composite origin will be found. The evidence seems to show that it\r\nis older than Vanua Levu; but they are both situated on the same\r\nsubmarine platform, the area of which is nearly equal to the combined\r\nareas of the two large islands that rise from it.\r\n\r\nThis platform, as indicated in the small plan of the group, is limited\r\nby the 100-fathom line in the charts; but since the reefs on their\r\nseaward slopes plunge down precipitously, such a line practically serves\r\nto delineate the margin of the plateau. It has been my object to show on\r\nprevious pages[153] that this submarine platform is a basaltic plateau\r\nbuilt up by submarine lava-flows and incrusted with coral reefs and\r\ntheir deposits. It has been pointed out that this platform passes\r\ngradually, as it proceeds landward, into the low-lying basaltic plains\r\nthat constitute the sea-border in the western part of the island, where\r\nthe breadth of the submerged plateau is greatest. The basaltic flows of\r\nthe plains often display the almost vertical columns of slightly\r\ninclined flows. Their apparent termination at the sea-border, where they\r\nare in places covered over with submarine deposits, cannot, however, be\r\naccepted as their real limits. According to my view they extend several\r\nmiles seaward and form the platform, as is shown in the sections on\r\npages 62 and 107.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIJI ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n  FROM ADMIRALTY CHART 780, CORRECTED TO 1901.\r\n\r\n  ALL DEPTHS BEYOND 100 FATHOMS ARE COLOURED BLACK.\r\n  HEIGHTS IN FEET, DEPTHS IN FATHOMS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe have in the great basaltic mountain of Seatura, which forms the bulk\r\nof the western end of the island, a probable source of many of these\r\nbasaltic flows; and the occurrence inland in the western half of Vanua\r\nLevu of elevated table-lands of basalt like that of Wainunu, which\r\nextend from the centre of the island to near the coast, afford testimony\r\nthat the formation of these flows extends over a considerable period of\r\nthe island’s history.\r\n\r\nIt is held by Professor Agassiz that these submarine platforms are the\r\nwork of erosion into the flanks of the up-heaved islands.[154] In\r\nChapter II. it has been pointed out that the eroding agencies are not\r\nactively in operation in our own day, and that there is good reason for\r\nthe belief that the process of amalgamation by which Vanua Levu has been\r\nbuilt up during a prolonged period of emergence, is not suspended at the\r\npresent time. It is assumed that the uniformity in Nature’s methods has\r\nnot been broken. If, however, we have here platforms of erosion, the\r\ncoasts of Vanua Levu, as far as my interpretation goes, supply no\r\nevidence of it; and we have to imagine that a period of emergence\r\nextending over a geological age has been followed by a similarly vast\r\nperiod of erosion without much change in level.\r\n\r\nWhatever agencies have been at work, the production of submarine\r\nplatforms 10 to 20 miles in width must have been a stupendous operation;\r\nand we shall be obliged to inquire whether plateaux, either submarine or\r\nupheaved, occur in association with volcanic islands in other parts of\r\nthe world, and under what conditions they have been formed. At least\r\nfour hypotheses have been framed with regard to the submarine platforms\r\nof Fiji. There is first the original theory of subsidence of Darwin; but\r\nVanua Levu, which presents one long story of emergence, offers nothing\r\nto support this view. There is the growth of a reef seaward on its own\r\ntalus, as advanced by Murray. There is the theory of erosion of Agassiz.\r\nThere is lastly my own idea of basaltic plateaux incrusted by reefs. We\r\nmay therefore inquire as to the evidence afforded by Vanua Levu in\r\nfavour of these views. Basaltic flows, in places covered by submarine\r\ndeposits, form the low plains at its sea-border, where the platforms are\r\nbroadest; and there rises a basaltic mountain of the Mauna Loa type,\r\noccupying most of the western end of the island. No one would be bold\r\nenough to place the limit of these basaltic flows at the water’s edge;\r\nand as is indicated in the sections, they probably extend for miles\r\nunder the sea.\r\n\r\nIf we look for an island which in its extensive palagonite-formations,\r\nin its basaltic table-lands and later basaltic flows, in its huge\r\nmountain-ridges, and in its evidence of submergence, most resembles\r\nVanua Levu, we seem to find it in Iceland. It is in Iceland, I think,\r\nthat we must expect an explanation of many of the puzzling features in\r\nthe structure of Vanua Levu.\r\n\r\nI pass on now to refer to some of the general points in the geology of\r\nthis island, which have been dealt with in detail in the earlier\r\nchapters of this work. With regard first to the distribution of the\r\nvolcanic rocks, it may be remarked that my materials do not lend\r\nthemselves to making a geological map. The most comprehensive idea of\r\nthe principal points in the geological structure will be obtained by\r\nreading the description of the profile given in Chapter I. There is,\r\nhowever, a method in the distribution of the rocks that may be again\r\nnoticed here. The plutonic rocks are very scantily exposed, as is shown\r\non page 249; and they are not displayed at all in the western half of\r\nthe island. The more basic eruptive rocks, the olivine-basalts and\r\nbasaltic andesites, are mainly confined to the western half, that is,\r\nwest of Nanduri on the north and of the Ndreke-ni-wai River on the\r\nsouth. Ordinary augite-andesites occur also in the western half; and\r\ntogether with the hypersthene-augite-andesites they are found over most\r\nof the rest of the island, excluding the north-east portion, east of\r\nLambasa and Tawaki, where quartz-porphyries, oligoclase-trachytes, and\r\nacid pumice tuffs prevail. The acid andesites, including the\r\nhornblende-andesites and the dacites or felsitic andesites, are best\r\nrepresented in the Ndrandramea district in the midst of the basic rocks.\r\nThey occur in the isolated peaks of Na Raro and Vatu Kaisia and in one\r\nor two other localities, as in the Valanga Range and on the shores of\r\nNatewa Bay in the vicinity of the Salt Lake. These peaks of acid\r\nandesites, as in the instances of Vatu Kaisia and Soloa Levu, are at\r\ntimes in part overwhelmed or surrounded by the basaltic flows. This\r\nsingular feature of bosses of acid rocks in the midst of basaltic fields\r\noffers another point of resemblance between Iceland and Vanua Levu.\r\n\r\nThe mountain-types vary considerably, the ridge-mountains, however,\r\nbeing most characteristic of the island. The basaltic mountain of\r\nSeatura, though its lava-flows were evidently in the main submarine,\r\nbelongs as before observed to the Mauna Loa type. In its radiating\r\nvalleys and gorges and in other characters it recalls the description\r\ngiven by Dana of the island of Tahiti. The peaks of acid andesites,\r\nrepresented in the isolated hills and mountains of the Ndrandramea\r\ndistrict, and in the solitary mountains of Vatu Kaisia and Na Raro, are\r\nthe necks and stumps of submarine volcanoes dating back to the\r\npre-basaltic period of the island. It is, however, in the great\r\nmountain-ridges of the central portion of the island, those of Va Lili,\r\nKorotini, Nawavi, Thambeyu, Mbatini, Mariko, &c., that we find, as just\r\nremarked, the most typical features of the internal topography of Vanua\r\nLevu.\r\n\r\nAgglomerates overlying palagonite-tuffs and clays, that are usually\r\nforaminiferous and sometimes inclose molluscan shells, clothe the slopes\r\nof these mountain-ridges up to elevations of 2,500 feet and over above\r\nthe sea. Most of these great ridges, now more or less covered over by\r\nthese submarine deposits, represent lines of submerged vents, of which\r\nonly a few raised their summits above the sea in the earliest stages in\r\nthe history of the island. At this early period there were no coral\r\nreefs. Some of the ridges present a marked parallel arrangement,\r\nrecalling the arrangement of the mountain-ridges and lesser chains of\r\nhills as described by Dr. Johnston-Lavis in the account of his visit to\r\nIceland.[155] The description of Hekla (as given by Thoroddsen) as “an\r\noblong ridge which has been fissured in the direction of its length and\r\nbears a row of craters along the fissure,”[156] comes very near to my\r\nconception of the original condition of these great mountain-ridges\r\nbefore the emergence. Dr. Johnston-Lavis sees in Hekla a type of\r\nvolcanic mountain very different from that of Vesuvius and Etna. He\r\nregards it as a ridge marked by a number of parallel ridges and furrows,\r\nand built up along a main fissure with a number of subsidiary parallel\r\nfissures.\r\n\r\nThe part taken by palagonite in the composition of the finer deposits\r\nover the greater portion of Vanua Levu is another prominent\r\ncharacteristic of the island. Palagonite, as I have suggested in Chapter\r\nXXIV., is formed probably on the surface of submarine flows of an\r\nophitic basaltic rock.\r\n\r\nThe age of the more recent of the deposits of this island, the\r\nfossiliferous tuffs, the pteropod-ooze rocks, and the foraminiferous\r\nmuds, cannot be far different from that of the same deposits in other\r\nparts of the group, since it is apparent that the same general movement\r\nof emergence has affected both of the two larger islands. Professor\r\nMartin of Leyden informed Dr. Wichmann that the fossil shells found in\r\nthe tuffs of Viti Levu, Ovalau, and other islands were Tertiary but not\r\nolder than the Miocene.[157] Dr. Dall, after examining the fossil\r\nmollusks collected by Professor Agassiz from the elevated limestones of\r\nFiji, confirmed the impression formed by the latter as to their late\r\nTertiary age. None of the genera were extinct, and the fossils were in\r\nhis opinion younger than Eocene and either Miocene or Pliocene.[158] The\r\nRev. J. E. Tenison-Woods described as extinct Tertiary fossils, some\r\ncorals and mollusks from the interior of Ovalau.[159] Mr. H. B. Brady,\r\nbasing his conclusions on the character of the foraminifera, assigned a\r\nPost-Tertiary date to the Suva “soapstone” taken at elevations up to 100\r\nfeet in that neighbourhood.[160] Professor David referring to some\r\nfossil teeth of Carcharodon and to a fossil Tridacna found at Walu Bay\r\ninfers that the deposits are at least as old as Pliocene but not as old\r\nas the earlier Tertiaries.[161] Since, as pointed out by Professor\r\nDavid, the latest movements of emergence have taken place in recent\r\ngeological time, these various observations go to show that whilst the\r\nlatest exposure of deposits has occurred in recent time the mass of the\r\nfossiliferous deposits date back to the Pliocene and the Miocene\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wichmann these islands were in a continental condition\r\nduring the Palæozoic and Mesozoic periods, and it was only in the later\r\nTertiary age that the movement of subsidence began that prepared the way\r\nfor the formation of the more recent deposits. The submergence during\r\nthe Tertiary period and the subsequent emergence are facts that cannot\r\nbe gainsaid; but we may ask where is the evidence of the continental\r\ncondition during the earlier periods. There is little in the results\r\nobtained from Vanua Levu that directly supports such an hypothesis.\r\nUnder such circumstances one ought to have discovered in the deposits of\r\nthis island some evidence of this early condition, and there should be\r\nfound in the fauna and flora some traces of the original organisms.\r\nAccording to Hedley there is some indication of a continental condition\r\nin the molluscan fauna, and he quotes Fairmaire as regarding the\r\nColeoptera as of a continental character; but no one, that I am aware\r\nof, has found any direct evidence of the Pre-Tertiary periods in this\r\ngroup. It is in harmony with the geological characters to assume that\r\nthese islands made their first appearance during the Tertiary epoch.\r\n\r\nComing to the subject of the movements whether of land or sea that led\r\nto the appearance of these islands, we shall not be begging the question\r\nif we speak of their “emergence.” There is no doubt as to there having\r\nbeen during and since the Tertiary epoch an emergence of some thousands\r\nof feet, allowing for the original depth of the foraminiferous deposits\r\nnow found at elevations of over 2,000 feet above the sea. In Chapter II.\r\nit is shown that there is good ground for the belief that these changes\r\nof level have not altogether ceased. Of what nature, we may ask, is this\r\nmovement. We have before us the grand conception of Suess that the\r\nemergence of the land in the different phases of geological time has\r\nbeen produced by the general lowering of the level of the ocean arising\r\nfrom local subsidences of the earth’s crust. This view in the case of\r\nthe recent calcareous formations of the Pacific is applied to the\r\nterraces of the Loyalty Islands;[162] and it follows that it is also\r\napplicable to the elevated calcareous deposits of the islands of the\r\nWestern Pacific as a whole, as in the case of the Tongan Islands, the\r\nNew Hebrides, the Solomon Group, &c. Such a general change of level\r\nought to be represented in the large island of Hawaii in the North\r\nPacific, since it could not be confined to one locality in this ocean.\r\nThere is no evidence of emergence, as far as I know, presented by this\r\nisland. During my sojourn there, I examined much of its coasts. Now the\r\nantiquity of the flora of this group is sufficiently attested by the\r\ncircumstance that it ranks first among the oceanic groups of the Pacific\r\nfor the number of endemic plants that it possesses; and the same\r\nconclusions may be drawn from the insects and the birds. There is no\r\nevidence in this group, one of the most ancient of the Pacific\r\narchipelagoes, of that great movement of emergence, which is abundantly\r\ndemonstrated over the Western Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe standpoint is therefore taken that the movement of emergence which\r\nbegan in the Tertiary period and is probably still in operation is\r\nconfined to the southern portion of the tropical Pacific. Speaking of\r\nthe time of the Fijian emergence, Professor Agassiz observes that “it is\r\nnot unnatural to assume that it was coincident with the elevation of\r\nNorthern Queensland, and that the area of elevation included New Guinea,\r\nthe islands to the east of it as far as New Caledonia, and as far east\r\nas the most distant of the Paumotus, and extended northward of that line\r\nto include the Gilbert, Ellice, Marshall, and Caroline Islands.”[163]\r\n\r\nFrom the report of Mr. Andrews[164] it is evident that in the Lau\r\nIslands of the Fiji Group volcanic outbreaks have taken place since the\r\nlast upheaval. He describes in the case of Mango and other islands the\r\nmanner in which cliffs of limestone form inliers in flows of andesitic\r\nlava. In the history of these islands he first distinguishes the period\r\nof calcareous deposits, when the bedded limestones forming the submarine\r\nplateau were laid down. Then followed a period of volcanism during which\r\nmasses of volcanic materials were erupted along the axis of elevation.\r\nAlternating epochs of upheaval and stable equilibrium ensued, during the\r\nlast of which the reefs grew outwards and formed the terraces now so\r\ncharacteristic of the profiles of the islands. After the last upheaval\r\nthe volcanic forces became again active. There is much of special\r\ninterest in the account given by Mr. Andrews of the Lau Group. The\r\nblocks of limestone included in the volcanic agglomerates distinguish\r\nthe Lau detrital rocks from those of Vanua Levu. There is no evidence\r\nthat coral reefs existed during the early stages of the emergence of\r\nVanua Levu to be obtained from the submarine formations found on the\r\nhigher levels, 1,000 to 2,500 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe period of emergence for this island may be divided into an earlier\r\nand into a later stage, the last corresponding to the age of emergence\r\nof the Lau Islands. The earlier stage, which may be termed the “Pre-Lau”\r\nstage, is represented by the deposits of the higher slopes of Vanua\r\nLevu, that is above 1,000 or 1,200 feet. This is really the critical\r\nepoch in the history of this group, and assuming that the movement of\r\nemergence has been fairly uniform over the archipelago we cannot but be\r\nastonished at the absence of all traces of ancient reefs in the earlier\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nWe may infer from the observations of Mr. Lister[165] that the islands\r\nof the Tonga Group represent the Lau stage of the emergence. They are\r\nsimilar in height and in general geological structure to the islands of\r\nLau, that of Eua, for instance, which has an elevation of 1,100 feet,\r\nbeing formed of reef-limestones overlying volcanic tuffs. Dykes\r\npenetrate the tuffs but do not enter the incrusting calcareous strata.\r\nMr. Harker,[166] after examining the collections of Mr. Lister, remarks\r\nthat all the rocks excepting those from Falcon Island appear to be of\r\nsubmarine formation. The volcanic material, he adds, seems to have been\r\nalmost exclusively of fragmental character. It would be rash, it is\r\nremarked, to refer all the rocks to a Recent age, and some of them may\r\nbe found to go back far into Tertiary times.\r\n\r\nMy division of the long period occupied by the emergence of the Fiji\r\nIslands into two stages, the Lau stage corresponding to elevations of\r\nless than 1,000 or 1,200 feet, and the Pre-Lau stage which includes the\r\nearlier evidence of emergence found at heights exceeding these\r\nelevations and ranging up to 2,000 or 3,000 feet, may perhaps be\r\napplicable to other regions of emergence.\r\n\r\nAs bearing on the question of the isolation and antiquity of the Pacific\r\nIslands the following approximate results for the Hawaiian, Fijian, and\r\nTongan floras may be here quoted.[167] These data are liable to\r\ncorrection; but they are near enough to the truth to be very suggestive.\r\nOf peculiar genera of flowering plants and ferns the Hawaiian Islands\r\npossess about 40, the Fiji Group about 16, and the Tongan Islands none.\r\nOf endemic species of flowering plants there are about 80 per cent. in\r\nHawaii, about 50 per cent. in Fiji, and 3 or 4 per cent. in Tonga.\r\nGranting that there is much to be done yet in the investigation of these\r\nfloras, it would be underrating the brilliant results of the labours of\r\nHillebrand and Seemann to characterise their work as sampling. Let us\r\nsuppose, however, that the floras of Hawaii, Fiji, and Tonga have been\r\nonly sampled, the data above given would be still reliable. It is quite\r\npossible to obtain a botanical equivalent corresponding to the\r\ngeological estimates of the relative ages of these islands; and taking\r\nthe proportion of endemic plants as our guide, the Lau stage, as\r\nrepresented by the Tongan Islands, would have a value of 3 or 4, the\r\nPre-Lau stage now exhibited in the earliest stage of emergence of Vanua\r\nLevu would have a value of 50, and the Hawaiian stage older than all\r\nwould have a value of 80. These results are intended as suggestive and I\r\nhope to work out this subject in the second volume. They make the\r\nproblem of the relative antiquity of these islands more mysterious than\r\nit even appeared before.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the vexed question of the light thrown on the past\r\ncondition of these islands by the present state of their floras and\r\nfaunas, it may be at once observed that my belief in the general\r\nprinciple that islands have always been islands has not been shaken by\r\nthe results of the examination of the geological structure of Vanua\r\nLevu. In a correspondence in _Nature_ about fifteen years ago it was\r\nsuggested by me that this is the position we ought to take with regard\r\nto the stocking with plants of the islands of the Southern Ocean, such\r\nas Kerguelen; and I take the same standpoint for the islands of the\r\nPacific. If the distribution of a particular group of plants or animals\r\ndoes not seem to accord with the present arrangement of the land, it is\r\nby far the safest plan, even after exhausting all likely modes of\r\nexplanation, not to invoke the intervention of geographical changes. New\r\npossibilities of inter-communication, new ways of looking at old facts,\r\nand new discoveries of an unexpected nature come monthly before us in\r\nthe progress of scientific research; and I scarcely think that our\r\nknowledge of any one group of organisms is ever sufficiently precise to\r\njustify a recourse to hypothetical alterations in the present relations\r\nof land and sea.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of a Pacific continent,[168] whether it takes a\r\ntrans-oceanic form, as advocated by Von Ihering, Hutton, Baur and\r\nothers, or whether it is represented by an island-continent isolated in\r\nmesozoic times, as suggested by Pilsbry, receives no support from the\r\ngeological characters of Vanua Levu. Nor can I accept as regards Fiji\r\nMr. Hedley’s theory of the Melanesian Plateau. There is no evidence that\r\nthe various islands of the Fiji Group were ever amalgamated and no\r\nindication of a geological nature that they were ever joined to the\r\nSolomon Group. The Fijis, as we see them, have had an independent\r\nhistory, and the process at work is not one of disruption but of\r\namalgamation, lesser islands being united to larger islands during the\r\nprolonged period of emergence. Mr. Hedley, however, has some weighty\r\ndata on his side more especially zoological; but even here it would be\r\nwise to suspend one’s judgment. Though the great mass of botanical\r\nevidence is as respects Fiji opposed to such connections, the\r\ndistribution of Dammara may, however, be fairly claimed on their behalf.\r\n\r\nThe dilemma into which such discussions lead us is aptly stated by Dr.\r\nPilsbry. If we do not accept the hypothesis of a Pacific continent, we\r\nhave to explain the cessation of the means of transportal in later\r\ngeological times, since this is implied in the isolation necessary for\r\nthe development of peculiar characters in a fauna or a flora. This was\r\nthe dilemma that presented itself to me in studying the origin of the\r\nFijian plants. Assuming on geological grounds that the insular condition\r\nhad been always maintained I had to explain the differentiation in the\r\ninland plants, or in other words to account for the failure of the means\r\nof transportal that once existed. Since this subject bears directly on\r\nthe past condition of the Fiji Islands, I may be pardoned for referring\r\nto it here. It belongs properly to the second volume which it is\r\nproposed to devote to the dispersal and distribution of Pacific plants;\r\nbut as I contest the pre-existence of a Pacific continent, it is fitting\r\nthough not necessary that this difficulty should be faced at once.\r\n\r\nIf we in imagination combine in a typical island the characters of the\r\nflora presented by islands of different elevation in the Pacific we get\r\na result of this kind in an island of the height of Hawaii, nearly\r\n14,000 feet. The littoral plants of such an island are found all over\r\nthe coasts of the tropical Pacific, and for the explanation of this fact\r\nwe look mainly to the agency of the ocean-currents. The plants of the\r\nmountain summit, belonging to the temperate genera of Geranium, Rubus,\r\nRanunculus, Vaccinium, &c., are represented at least generically on the\r\ntops of the lofty ranges of the Pacific coasts and in the interior of\r\nthe continents; and we find the explanation of the wide diffusion of\r\nsuch plants in the agency of the migrant birds that at no distant time,\r\nif not actually in our own time, were regular visitors to these mountain\r\nregions. The plants of the marsh, of the stream, and of the pond, belong\r\noften to species that occur in similar stations over a great portion of\r\nthe world, such as species of Drosera, Ruppia, Potamogeton, &c.; and\r\nhere the agency of wild duck and other waterfowl may be observed in\r\nactive operation.\r\n\r\nBut when in such an island we regard the intermediate region between the\r\nuplands and the coast, usually the forest-zone, we find an area of\r\nchange not only for the plants but also for the birds. It is here that\r\nthe new genera of plants have been developed that distinguish the floras\r\nof the Pacific groups each from the others; and here also the migrant\r\nbird, having from some cause changed its ways, has given rise to new\r\nvarieties and to new species. It is with this loss of the migratory\r\npowers of the birds of the forest-zone that I connect many of the\r\nimportant differences between the forest-floras of the different groups\r\nof the Pacific. At one time, it would seem, birds were far more active\r\nagents in dispersing seeds and fruits over these archipelagoes than they\r\nare at present; but it is not held that this is concerned with the\r\nextermination and extinction of the birds of these islands in the\r\npresent day. The change dates far back and is far-reaching in its\r\neffects. It is assumed in this argument that the alpine plant and the\r\nplant of the pond and of the sea-shore preserve their characters by\r\nreason of the means of free dispersal that they still enjoy; and it is\r\ninferred that the plant of the forest-zone has varied more because\r\nopportunities of transportal of its kind no longer are afforded. Many a\r\nline of ancient migration is now broken.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that in the past when birds were more generalised in\r\ntype they were much more migratory in habits and that limitation of\r\nrange has been associated with specialisation. The plants dispersed by\r\nthe birds have undergone a parallel series of changes. At first widely\r\ndistributed, as in the more generalised types of birds, they became\r\nlocalised in proportion as the birds to which they owed their means of\r\ndispersal lost their migratory ways; and both plant and bird began to\r\nvary. There is, I am convinced, a profound connection between birds and\r\nplants, of which we now perceive only the last of a long series of\r\nchanges. This subject will be dealt with at length in the volume on\r\nplant-dispersal; and it is only referred to here to illustrate my\r\ncontention that we have yet much to learn before it would be safe to\r\nlook to hypothetical changes of sea and land to explain difficulties in\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note on the Stone-Axes._—Two of these polished stone-axes from a\r\ncollection made in Vanua Levu were selected for sections. One is\r\nlight-green and smooth. The other has a very different appearance, being\r\nblackish and rather rough, its smooth surface having been apparently\r\nlost by lying in a stream-course or in wet ground for a long period.\r\nBoth, however, are made of the same type of basaltic rock, the specific\r\ngravity in one case being 2·93, in the other 2·97. It is an aphanitic\r\nbasalt with scanty olivine containing little or no residual glass and\r\nreferred to genus 40 of the olivine-basalts. It is by no means a common\r\ntype of basalt in Vanua Levu, and I cannot refer it to any particular\r\nlocality on account of the peculiarities it presents when contrasted\r\nwith rocks of the same genus. The olivine is very scanty and small, and\r\nin one of the specimens is represented only by pseudomorphs. The\r\nfelspar-lathes vary usually from ·05 to ·2 mm. in length, and the augite\r\ngranules which are very abundant are ·01 or ·02 mm. in diameter. There\r\nis an occasional small phenocryst of augite. The rock shows little or no\r\nalteration and cannot be characterised as a greenstone. The greenish hue\r\nof one axe is due to weathering; but its extension into the internal\r\nblack portion of the tool is not appreciable.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Note on the ascent of the tide up the Ndreketi River._—On July 20th and\r\n21st, 1899, by observing the surface density it was ascertained that at\r\nhigh-water the sea-water reached Navundi a mile or two below Mbatiri.

(_Geology of the\r\n  Solomon Islands_, p. 37.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  In 1897 I spent several months in travelling over this island and\r\n  ascended, sometimes more than once, the three great volcanic\r\n  mountains. Perhaps at some future time I may renew my examination of\r\n  this interesting region.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Strictly speaking Korolevu indicated in the profile would not be\r\n  visible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Mariko is the native name of the Drayton Peak of the chart. Mbatini is\r\n  the correct name for the Koro Mbasanga of the chart, the true Koro\r\n  Mbasanga lying three miles to the north. Thambeyu is a native name for\r\n  the Mount Thurston Range.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  There has been some confusion in the native names of the peaks in this\r\n  part of the island, which I have not been able to remove.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  _A Year in Fiji_, 1881, pp. 22, 167.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  _Geology of the United States Exploring Expedition_, 1849.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  This height has been supplied from memory, as I omitted to refer to\r\n  the exact level of the erosion line in my notes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  They were described to me as dry for a fortnight at a time. I was\r\n  prevented from making more than an occasional visit to them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  _Atlas of the United States Exploring Expedition_, vol. i.,\r\n  Philadelphia, 1850.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  This, however, is not the case with the recent changes at the mouth of\r\n  the Rewa River in Viti Levu, where the bare sandy point of Lauthala\r\n  has extended itself seaward between 500 and 600 yards since 1840,\r\n  whilst Port Nukulau has shoaled a fathom in the same period. But I can\r\n  find no evidence of any marked advance in the mangrove margins either\r\n  towards Nukulau or on the Kamba side, the only change recognisable\r\n  being in the bare _sandy_ point of Lauthala, the rapid extension of\r\n  which has been such as to attract the attention of residents, both\r\n  whites and natives. Dana, who was in this locality in 1840, remarks in\r\n  the _Geology of the U.S. Exploring Expedition_, that he had learned\r\n  from a person who had resided there for forty years that during this\r\n  period the deposits had lengthened the river half a mile. When I was\r\n  on the Rewa in 1897 I heard that the natives in old time could see\r\n  Suva Point from Rewa. This is probably a native legend connected with\r\n  the modern extension of Lauthala Point. (The charts compared in making\r\n  the above measurement of the recent advance of this point were the\r\n  plan of the Rewa Roads by Wilkes, in 1840, and the Admiralty charts\r\n  1757 and 905, the former of which was based on Lieut. Dawson’s survey\r\n  in 1875, the last being corrected to 1897.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Between Mathuata Island and the coast a change is indicated from 9-10\r\n  fathoms to 8-9 fathoms, north of Motua Island 12-13 to 11-12, and\r\n  between Nangano and Thakavi 16 to 14 fathoms.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  By referring to the chart it will be seen that extensive mud-flats\r\n  occur at the mouths of the Sarawanga and Ndreketi rivers, where the\r\n  land-margin is slowly advancing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  _United States Exploring Expedition_, vol. x.; _Geology_, by J.

They are sketched in the descriptions of Kleinschmidt, Miss\r\n  Cumming, and Commodore Wilkes. The analyses are given on a later page\r\n  together with the references.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  _Pacific Islands, Sailing Directions_, vol. ii., Central Groups, 1900,\r\n  p. 185.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  From what I remember the usual exposure at low-water in 1898 was less\r\n  than a foot. I have little doubt as to the identity of the locality.\r\n  This rock is one of the “sights” of the place at the present time. It\r\n  would be interesting for a resident to compare carefully its present\r\n  condition with that as described by Wilkes. Dana in the work quoted on\r\n  p. 10, refers to this rock as a knoll of basalt; but he never visited\r\n  the locality and only obtained his account from the officers of\r\n  Wilkes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  _Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition_, III., 199, by\r\n  Commodore Wilkes.

Miss Gordon\r\n  Cumming in _At Home in Fiji_ gives the same analysis but differently\r\n  stated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  To avoid error, I have given the results of each without converting\r\n  them to a common standard. The numbers in brackets are taken from the\r\n  form of Prof. Liversidge’s analysis given in Miss Gordon Cumming’s\r\n  book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  _United States Exploring Expedition_, vol. 10, Geology.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  _Proceedings_, Queensland Branch, Geographical Society, Australia,\r\n  vol. 1. 1886.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  I took the temperature at monthly intervals between October, 1896, and\r\n  September, 1897. The mean annual temperature of the air in the shade\r\n  would be about 64° at an elevation of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  At Ewa there are pumping plants capable of supplying 75 million\r\n  gallons a day, the water being drawn entirely from artesian wells.\r\n  (_Report on Hawaii_, by Dr. Stubbs, bulletin 95, 1901; U.S. Department\r\n  of Agriculture.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  This hill is figured in Wilkes’ narrative under the name of Dillon’s\r\n  Rock (vol. 3, p. 235). This, however, is not the Dillon’s Rock of his\r\n  chart, where the name is given to a rock on the west side of the\r\n  entrance to Wailea Bay.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  See remarks on “crush-tuffs” on p. 334.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Species not identified.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  In one of my traverses I crossed a level district extending a mile\r\n  N.E. of Ndriti without changing my elevation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  At Delanasau, on the north or dry coast of the island, the average\r\n  rainfall, according to many years’ observations by Mr. Holmes, is\r\n  about 115 inches. At Wainunu, near the wet or south coast, the\r\n  observations of Mr. Barratt and others extending over 16 years give an\r\n  average of 160 inches. In the mountains this would be nearly doubled.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  This question, which has so often been raised with respect to the\r\n  propylites, will probably receive a different answer from different\r\n  localities. The matter is further discussed on later pages.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  The dyke-rock has a specific gravity of 2·7; but is slightly\r\n  vesicular. It shows a few small plagioclase phenocrysts in a\r\n  groundmass of felspar-lathes, augite grains and prisms, magnetite, and\r\n  a little brown interstitial glass. The felspar-lathes average ·14 mm.\r\n  in length and are for the most part not parallel. Secondary calcite\r\n  occurs in the groundmass, and the powdered rock effervesces a little\r\n  in an acid.\r\n\r\n  The rock forming the offshoot of the dyke differs only from the parent\r\n  rock in its more vitreous character. Although the felspars and augites\r\n  of the groundmass are fairly developed, the residual glass is much\r\n  more copious, and in places where it has segregated, forming\r\n  “lakelets,” it has been subjected to an alteration often observed in\r\n  palagonite when there are concentric alternating zones of a\r\n  tan-coloured fairly refractive material and calcite.\r\n\r\n  The reddish scoriaceous lava in contact with the dyke shows no\r\n  phenocrysts. The groundmass displays more or less parallel\r\n  felspar-lathes, ·1 mm. long, augite grains, and much magnetite. The\r\n  residual glass is fair in quantity; but is mostly gathered into\r\n  “lakelets” of brown altered glass with sometimes calcite in the\r\n  centre.\r\n\r\n  The vitreous border of the dyke is composed of a dark glass quite\r\n  opaque in the outer portion, but clearer and showing incipient\r\n  crystallisation in the inner portion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  _Characteristics of Volcanoes_, 1890.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genus 16 of the olivine-basalts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  This subject is discussed in Chapter XXVI.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  “Na Savu” is the Fijian for waterfall. The complete name of this fall\r\n  is “Na Savu ni nuku.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  The flinty concretions are described on page 354, and the iron sand on\r\n  p. 356.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  _Geology of the United States Exploring Expedition._\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  A similar arrangement was observed in the columnar basalt of Kauai in\r\n  the Hawaiian Islands. It is presumed that these Hawaiian flows are\r\n  sub-aërial.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  The unaltered glass, which incloses a few plagioclase phenocrysts, has\r\n  a specific gravity of 2·7, and is readily fusible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  They are described on p. 322.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  This absence of a healthy forest-growth, such as occurs on the level\r\n  summit of the neighbouring Soloa Levu and in all like situations, has\r\n  probably some geological significance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  These tuffs are probably submarine. They will be found described with\r\n  tuffs of the same character on p. 333.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  The track attains an elevation of about 1,300 feet, but the top of the\r\n  watershed is two or three hundred feet lower.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  It belongs to the 3rd order of the hornblende-hypersthene-andesites\r\n  described on p. 299.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Occasional views of its summit only are obtained from the eastward, as\r\n  from the Ndrandramea mountains and their vicinity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Alluvial gold has long been known to occur in the bed of the Yanawai\r\n  below Vatu Kaisia; but it has never been found in paying quantity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  Under the microscope it is shown to be granular in structure,\r\n  exhibiting a mosaic of irregular quartz grains.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  The blocks of the agglomerate in this last locality are from one to\r\n  three feet across.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  It displays in the groundmass augite prisms in flow-arrangement, and\r\n  is referred to genus 20 of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genera 16 and 20 of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  These foraminiferal limestones are described on p. 319.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  _Proceedings_, Queensland Branch, Geographical Society of Australasia,\r\n  Brisbane, 1886, vol. i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  _Geology of the United States Exploring Expedition._\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  _Pacific Islands_, vol. ii. 1900.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  It is referred to the 5th sub-order (genus 18) of the\r\n  hypersthene-augite-andesites characterised by prismatic pyroxene and\r\n  more or less parallel felspar lathes in the groundmass, as described\r\n  on p. 289. It displays abundant opaque porphyritic plagioclase giving\r\n  extinctions of oligoclase-andesine. The pyroxene phenocrysts have dark\r\n  alteration-borders. There is a little altered interstitial glass.\r\n  Spec. grav. 2·55.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  I did not ascend to the top of Ulu-i-mbau. It is, however, evidently\r\n  composed of basic andesitic rocks, occasionally amygdaloidal. On its\r\n  slopes up to at least 600 feet above the sea occur agglomerate-tuffs\r\n  and finer submarine tuffs, as above described, overlying\r\n  foraminiferous clays, a submergence of quite 500 feet being indicated\r\n  by the investing deposits.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  I did not find any foraminiferal shells or other organic remains\r\n  either in this tuff or in the similar tuffs occurring on the adjacent\r\n  slope of Va-lili up to 1,100 feet. My specimens, however, are very\r\n  small.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  It rises in the background of the view.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  They are described under sample E on p. 332.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genus 37 of the olivine-basalts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  On the right side of the river close to Vatu-kawa there are some\r\n  cliffs displaying a section of the mountainous spur, referred to on p.\r\n  151, that separates the valleys of the Mbale-mbale and Vatu-kawa\r\n  rivers, an exposure quite apart from the rocks exhibited on the\r\n  adjacent southern slopes of the main range. These cliffs are formed of\r\n  bedded grey tuffs marked by single layers of blocks 6 to 8 inches\r\n  across and dipping about 30° S.S.W. The tuffs in their texture are not\r\n  unlike sub-aerial tuff-deposits. They contain no lime and are composed\r\n  of basic materials with a little palagonite. They seem to indicate\r\n  some subsidiary vent, close to the present village of Vatu-kawa, which\r\n  may have been active shortly before or during the emergence of this\r\n  district.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  These altered tuffs on the southern slope of this range are described\r\n  on p. 332.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genus 16, species A, sub-species 1, of the\r\n  augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genus 9, sub-genus A, of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genus 9, sub-genus B, of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  Both these rocks belong to the hypersthene-augite andesites, showing\r\n  phenocrysts of both monoclinic and rhombic pyroxene. The first belongs\r\n  to the orthophyric order described on p. 290; whilst the second\r\n  belongs to the second order (genus 13, p. 287) where the felspars of\r\n  the groundmass are lathe-like and in flow arrangement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  The highest dyke trends N. 48° E. and is inclined from the vertical\r\n  about 15° N.W. The dyke, 5 or 6 yards below it, trends N. 30°E. and is\r\n  vertical. The dyke, 50 yards farther down, trends N. 35° E. and is\r\n  inclined from the vertical about 5° N.W. The inclination was only\r\n  estimated. The bearings are true.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  Both the types are referred to genus 1 of the augite-andesites, the\r\n  olivine, when present, being quite insufficient to give a character to\r\n  the rock. They however belong to different species according to the\r\n  length of the felspar-lathes, which in the doleritic rocks averages\r\n  ·2 mm. and in the other type ·08 mm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  It is pointed out on p. 5 that this name is wrongly applied in the\r\n  Admiralty charts to Mount Mbatini, a mountain about three miles south\r\n  of it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genus 13 of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  They are blackish and somewhat compact (sp. gr. 2·67-2·71) and have\r\n  very small felspar-lathes less than ·1 mm. long. They contain both\r\n  rhombic and monoclinic pyroxene, and are referred to genera 1 and 13\r\n  of the hypersthene-augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  I discovered this error in a rather practical fashion by ascending the\r\n  wrong mountain. The natives were engaged to take me to Koro-mbasanga\r\n  and they performed their task, my aneroid and compass soon indicating\r\n  that I was not on the highest peak of the island, but on a lesser peak\r\n  three miles north of it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  Vula Votu is the name of a peak lying to the east. Ngoinangai is a\r\n  forked mountain still further east.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  A kind of “edible” bird’s-nest is found in this cave.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  This rock is described on p. 251.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  It is described under Sample C on p. 325.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  It is granular, but fuses in the blowpipe flame into a clear glass and\r\n  gelatinises in HCl. Probably a form of natrolite.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  It is described under Sample D on p. 326.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  _Ten Months in Fiji_, London, 1864.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  _A Year in Fiji_, pp. 154, 169; London, 1881.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  It displays an abundance of small phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite,\r\n  and olivine partly serpentinised, in a groundmass composed in the main\r\n  of coarse augite grains (·025 mm. in size) and of felspar microliths\r\n  (·07 mm. in length) in smaller proportion, with little if any residual\r\n  glass. Specific gravity 2·98. It is near the Waikawa basalt, referred\r\n  to on p. 202, and is placed in the same genus (13) of the olivine\r\n  class.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  They are described on p. 269 under the non-porphyritic sub-genus of\r\n  genus 2 of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  These rocks are in most cases referred to the orthophyric and felsitic\r\n  orders of the hypersthene-augite andesites. The rocks of the\r\n  last-named order prevail, and form the type of the group, as described\r\n  on p. 291.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  It belongs to genus 37 of the olivine class. The felspar-lathes\r\n  average 0·2 mm. in length, and there is a little altered interstitial\r\n  glass.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  It is referred to genus 16, species D, of the augite-andesites. The\r\n  felspar-lathes have an average length of ·3 mm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  _Proceedings_, Queensland Branch, Geographical Society of Australia,\r\n  vol. i.; 1886.\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genus 9 of the augite-andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  The general characters of these rocks are described on p. 308.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  _Geology of the United States Exploring Expedition._\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  _A Year in Fiji_, p. 22.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  Described on p. 310.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  These rocks are described on p. 308.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  It contains small phenocrysts of plagioclase (medium andesine), and of\r\n  augite and rhombic pyroxene, and is referred to genus 1 of the\r\n  hypersthene-augite andesites.\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  See paper quoted on p. 31. It is noteworthy that Mr. Horne refers only\r\n  to a single floating island.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  _Journal_, Royal Geographical Society, June, 1894.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  Described on p. 309.\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  Described on p. 310.\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genus 13 of the augite-andesites. The felspar-lathes\r\n  average ·1 mm. in length, and there is a little interstitial glass.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  Referred to genus 16 of the augite-andesites. There are two sets of\r\n  felspar-lathes in the groundmass; the larger, ·23 mm. long, are more\r\n  or less parallel; the smaller, ·04 mm. long, form a plexus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  Each division would theoretically also possess an orthophyric and a\r\n  felsitic order; but these orders are not represented in my collection\r\n  and need only be mentioned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  Not represented in the collection.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  I apply the term “diorite” to granitoid rocks formed entirely of\r\n  plagioclase and hornblende.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  According to the size of the plagioclase phenocrysts, whether\r\n  averaging less than or more than 3 mm. in size, these rocks may be\r\n  divided into a non-porphyritic and a porphyritic sub-genus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  _Petrographie des Viti Archipels_; Miner. und Petrogr.
