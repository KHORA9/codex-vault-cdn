The book is therefore divided\r\ninto Two Parts: the first chiefly narrative, and the second chiefly\r\nscientific.\r\n\r\nIn Part I. I have sought to convey some notion of the life of an Alpine\r\nexplorer, and of the means by which his knowledge is acquired. In Part\r\nII. an attempt is made to classify such knowledge, and to refer the\r\nobserved phenomena to their physical causes.\r\n\r\nThe Second Part of the work is written with a desire to interest\r\nintelligent persons who may not possess any special scientific culture.\r\nFor their sakes I have dwelt more fully on principles than I should have\r\ndone in presence of a purely scientific audience. The brief sketch of\r\nthe nature of Light and Heat, with which Part II. is commenced, will\r\nnot, I trust, prove uninteresting to the reader for whom it is more\r\nespecially designed.\r\n\r\nShould any obscurity exist as to the meaning of the terms Structure,\r\nDirt-bands, Regelation, Interference, and others, which occur in Part\r\nI., it will entirely disappear in the perusal of Part II.\r\n\r\nTwo ascents of Mont Blanc and two of Monte Rosa are recorded; but the\r\naspects of nature, and other circumstances which attracted my attention,\r\nwere so different in the respective cases, that repetition was scarcely\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe numerous interesting articles on glaciers which have been published\r\nduring the last eighteen months, and the various lively discussions to\r\nwhich the subject has given birth, have induced me to make myself better\r\nacquainted than I had previously been with the historic aspect of the\r\nquestion. In some important cases I have stated, with the utmost\r\npossible brevity, the results of my reading, and thus, I trust,\r\ncontributed to the formation of a just estimate of men whose labours in\r\nthis field were long anterior to my own.\r\n\r\n                                                  J. T.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution, June, 1860._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Glaciers of the Alps\" was published nearly six and thirty years ago,\r\nand has been long out of print, its teaching in a condensed form having\r\nbeen embodied in the little book called \"Forms of Water.\" The two books\r\nare, however, distinct in character; each appears to me to supplement\r\nthe other; and as the older work is still frequently asked for, I have,\r\nat the suggestion of my husband's Publishers, consented to the present\r\nreprint, which may be followed later on by a reprint of \"Hours of\r\nExercise.\"\r\n\r\nBefore reproducing a book written so long ago, I sought to assure myself\r\nthat it contained nothing touching the views of others which my husband\r\nmight have wished at the present time to alter or omit. With this object\r\nI asked Lord Kelvin to be good enough to read over for me the pages\r\nwhich deal with the history of the subject and with discussions in which\r\nhe himself took an active part. In kind response he writes:--\"... After\r\ncarefully going through all the passages relating to those old\r\ndifferences I could not advise the omission of any of them from the\r\nreprint. There were, no doubt, some keen differences of opinion and\r\njudgement among us, and other friends now gone from us, but I think the\r\nstatements on controversial points in this beautiful and interesting\r\nbook of your husband's are all thoroughly courteous and considerate of\r\nfeelings, and have been felt to be so by those whose views were\r\ncontested or criticised in them.\"\r\n\r\nThe current spelling of Swiss names has changed considerably since\r\n\"Glaciers of the Alps\" was written, but, except in the very few cases\r\nwhere an obvious oversight called for correction, the text has been left\r\nunaltered. Only the Index has been made somewhat fuller than it was.\r\n\r\n                                                  L. C.

Guided by a friend who knew the\r\ncountry, I became acquainted with its chief beauties, and concluded the\r\nexpedition by a visit to Bangor and the neighbouring slate quarries of\r\nPenrhyn.\r\n\r\nFrom my boyhood I had been accustomed to handle slates; had seen them\r\nused as roofing materials, and had worked the usual amount of arithmetic\r\nupon them at school; but now, as I saw the rocks blasted, the broken\r\nmasses removed to the sheds surrounding the quarry, and there cloven\r\ninto thin plates, a new interest was excited, and I could not help\r\nasking after the cause of this extraordinary property of cleavage. It\r\nsufficed to strike the point of an iron instrument into the edge of a\r\nplate of rock to cause the mass to yield and open, as wood opens in\r\nadvance of a wedge driven into it. I walked round the quarry and\r\nobserved that the planes of cleavage were everywhere parallel; the rock\r\nwas capable of being split in one direction only, and this direction\r\nremained perfectly constant throughout the entire quarry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLEAVAGE OF SLATE ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nI was puzzled, and, on expressing my perplexity to my companion, he\r\nsuggested that the cleavage was nothing more than the layers in which\r\nthe rock had been originally deposited, and which, by some subsequent\r\ndisturbance, had been set on end, like the strata of the sandstone rocks\r\nand chalk cliffs of Alum Bay. But though I was too ignorant to combat\r\nthis notion successfully, it by no means satisfied me. I did not know\r\nthat at the time of my visit this very question of slaty cleavage was\r\nexciting the greatest attention among English geologists, and I quitted\r\nthe place with that feeling of intellectual discontent which, however\r\nunpleasant it may be for a time, is very useful as a stimulant, and\r\nperhaps as necessary to the true appreciation of knowledge as a healthy\r\nappetite is to the enjoyment of food.\r\n\r\nOn inquiry I found that the subject had been treated by three English\r\nwriters, Professor Sedgwick, Mr. Daniel Sharpe, and Mr. Sorby. From\r\nProfessor Sedgwick I learned that cleavage and stratification were\r\nthings totally distinct from each other; that in many cases the strata\r\ncould be observed with the cleavage passing through them at a high\r\nangle; and that this was the case throughout vast areas in North Wales\r\nand Cumberland. I read the lucid and important memoir of this eminent\r\ngeologist with great interest: it placed the data of the problem before\r\nme, as far as they were then known, and I found myself, to some extent\r\nat least, in a condition to appreciate the value of a theoretic\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nEverybody has heard of the force of gravitation, and of that of\r\ncohesion; but there is a more subtle play of forces exerted by the\r\nmolecules of bodies upon each other when these molecules possess\r\nsufficient freedom of action. In virtue of such forces, the ultimate\r\nparticles of matter are enabled to build themselves up into those\r\nwondrous edifices which we call crystals. A diamond is a crystal\r\nself-erected from atoms of carbon; an amethyst is a crystal built up\r\nfrom particles of silica; Iceland spar is a crystal built by particles\r\nof carbonate of lime. By artificial means we can allow the particles of\r\nbodies the free play necessary to their crystallization. Thus a solution\r\nof saltpetre exposed to slow evaporation produces crystals of saltpetre;\r\nalum crystals of great size and beauty may be obtained in a similar\r\nmanner; and in the formation of a bit of common sugar-candy there are\r\nagencies at play, the contemplation of which, as mere objects of\r\nthought, is sufficient to make the wisest philosopher bow down in\r\nwonder, and confess himself a child.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRYSTALLIZATION THEORY.]\r\n\r\nThe particles of certain crystalline bodies are found to arrange\r\nthemselves in layers, like courses of atomic masonry, and along these\r\nlayers such crystals may be easily cloven into the thinnest laminae. Some\r\ncrystals possess _one_ such direction in which they may be cloven, some\r\nseveral; some, on the other hand, may be split with different facility\r\nin different directions. Rock salt may be cloven with equal facility in\r\nthree directions at right angles to each other; that is, it may be split\r\ninto cubes; calcspar may be cloven in three directions oblique to each\r\nother; that is, into rhomboids. Heavy spar may also be cloven in three\r\ndirections, but one cleavage is much more perfect, or more _eminent_ as\r\nit is sometimes called, than the rest. Mica is a crystal which cleaves\r\nvery readily in one direction, and it is sufficiently tough to furnish\r\nfilms of extreme tenuity: finally, any boy, with sufficient skill, who\r\ntries a good crystal of sugar-candy in various directions with the blade\r\nof his penknife, will find that it possesses one direction in\r\nparticular, along which, if the blade of the knife be placed and struck,\r\nthe crystal will split into plates possessing clean and shining surfaces\r\nof cleavage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POLAR FORCES.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Sedgwick was intimately acquainted with all these facts, and a\r\ngreat many more, when he investigated the cleavage of slate rocks; and\r\nseeing no other explanation open to him, he ascribed to slaty cleavage a\r\ncrystalline origin. He supposed that the particles of slate rock were\r\nacted on, after their deposition, by \"polar forces,\" which so arranged\r\nthem as to produce the cleavage. According to this theory, therefore,\r\nHonister Crag and the cliffs of Penrhyn are to be regarded as portions\r\nof enormous crystals; a length of time commensurate with the vastness of\r\nthe supposed action being assumed to have elapsed between the deposition\r\nof the rock and its final crystallization.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we look closely into this bold and beautiful hypothesis,\r\nwe find that the only analogy which exists between the physical\r\nstructure of slate rocks and of crystals is this single one of cleavage.\r\nSuch a coincidence might fairly give rise to the conjecture that both\r\nwere due to a common cause; but there is great difficulty in accepting\r\nthis as a theoretic truth. When we examine the structure of a slate\r\nrock, we find that the substance is composed of the debris of former\r\nrocks; that it was once a fine mud, composed of particles of _sensible\r\nmagnitude_. Is it meant that these particles, each taken as a whole,\r\nwere re-arranged after deposition? If so, the force which effected such\r\nan arrangement must be wholly different from that of crystallization,\r\nfor the latter is essentially _molecular_. What is this force? Nature,\r\nas far as we know, furnishes none competent, under the conditions, to\r\nproduce the effect. Is it meant that the molecules composing these\r\nsensible particles have re-arranged themselves? We find no evidence of\r\nsuch an action in the individual fragments: the mica is still mica, and\r\npossesses all the properties of mica; and so of the other ingredients of\r\nwhich the rock is composed. Independent of this, that an aggregate of\r\nheterogeneous mineral fragments should, without any assignable external\r\ncause, so shift its molecules as to produce a plane of cleavage common\r\nto them all, is, in my opinion, an assumption too heavy for any theory\r\nto bear.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the paper of Professor Sedgwick invested the subject of\r\nslaty cleavage with an interest not to be forgotten, and proved the\r\nstimulus to further inquiry. The structure of slate rocks was more\r\nclosely examined; the fossils which they contained were subjected to\r\nrigid scrutiny, and their shapes compared with those of the same species\r\ntaken from other rocks. Thus proceeding, the late Mr. Daniel Sharpe\r\nfound that the fossils contained in slate rocks are distorted in shape,\r\nbeing uniformly flattened out in the direction of the planes of\r\ncleavage. Here, then, was a fact of capital importance,--the shells\r\nbecame the indicators of an action to which the mass containing them had\r\nbeen subjected; they demonstrated the operation of pressure acting at\r\nright angles to the planes of cleavage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MECHANICAL THEORY.]\r\n\r\nThe more the subject was investigated, the more clearly were the\r\nevidences of pressure made out. Subsequent to Mr. Sharpe, Mr. Sorby\r\nentered upon this field of inquiry. With great skill and patience he\r\nprepared sections of slate rock, which he submitted to microscopic\r\nexamination, and his observations showed that the evidences of pressure\r\ncould be plainly traced, even in his minute specimens. The subject has\r\nbeen since ably followed up by Professors Haughton, Harkness, and\r\nothers; but to the two gentlemen first mentioned we are, I think,\r\nindebted for the prime facts on which rests the _mechanical theory_ of\r\nslaty cleavage.[A]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LECTURE AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION.]\r\n\r\nThe observations just referred to showed the co-existence of the two\r\nphenomena, but they did not prove that pressure and cleavage stood to\r\neach other in the relation of cause and effect. \"Can the pressure\r\nproduce the cleavage?\" was still an open question, and it was one which\r\nmere reasoning, unaided by experiment, was incompetent to answer.\r\nSharpe despaired of an experimental solution, regarding our means as\r\ninadequate, and our time on earth too short to produce the result. Mr.\r\nSorby was more hopeful. Submitting mixtures of gypsum and oxide of iron\r\nscales to pressure, he found that the scales set themselves\r\napproximately at right angles to the direction in which the pressure was\r\napplied. The position of the scales resembled that of the plates of mica\r\nwhich his researches had disclosed to him in slate rock, and he inferred\r\nthat the presence of such plates, and of flat or elongated fragments\r\ngenerally, lying all in the same general direction, was the cause of\r\nslaty cleavage. At the meeting of the British Association at Glasgow, in\r\n1855, I had the pleasure of seeing some of Mr. Sorby's specimens, and,\r\nthough the cleavage they exhibited was very rough, still, the tendency\r\nto yield at right angles to the direction in which the pressure had been\r\napplied, appeared sufficiently manifest.\r\n\r\nAt the time now referred to I was engaged, and had been for a long time\r\npreviously, in examining the effects of pressure upon the magnetic\r\nforce, and, as far back as 1851, I had noticed that some of the bodies\r\nwhich I had subjected to pressure exhibited a cleavage of surpassing\r\nbeauty and delicacy. The bearing of such facts upon the present question\r\nnow forcibly occurred to me. I followed up the observations; visited\r\nslate yards and quarries, observed the exfoliation of rails, the fibres\r\nof iron, the structure of tiles, pottery, and cheese, and had several\r\npractical lessons in the manufacture of puff-paste and other laminated\r\nconfectionery. My observations, I thought, pointed to a theory of slaty\r\ncleavage different from any previously given, and which, moreover,\r\nreferred a great number of apparently unrelated phenomena to a common\r\ncause. On the 10th of June, 1856, I made them the subject of a Friday\r\nevening's discourse at the Royal Institution.[B]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORIGIN OF RESEARCHES.]\r\n\r\nSuch are the circumstances, apparently remote enough, under which my\r\nconnexion with glaciers originated. My friend Professor Huxley was\r\npresent at the lecture referred to: he was well acquainted with the work\r\nof Professor Forbes, entitled 'Travels in the Alps,' and he surmised\r\nthat the question of slaty cleavage, in its new aspect, might have some\r\nbearing upon the laminated structure of glacier-ice discussed in the\r\nwork referred to. He therefore urged me to read the 'Travels,' which I\r\ndid with care, and the book made the same impression upon me that it had\r\nproduced upon my friend. We were both going to Switzerland that year,\r\nand it required but a slight modification of our plans to arrange a\r\njoint excursion over some of the glaciers of the Oberland, and thus\r\nafford ourselves the means of observing together the veined structure of\r\nthe ice.\r\n\r\nHad the results of this arrangement been revealed to me beforehand, I\r\nshould have paused before entering upon an investigation which required\r\nof me so long a renunciation of my old and more favourite pursuits. But\r\nno man knows when he commences the examination of a physical problem\r\ninto what new and complicated mental alliances it may lead him. No\r\nfragment of nature can be studied alone; each part is related to every\r\nother part; and hence it is, that, following up the links of law which\r\nconnect phenomena, the physical investigator often finds himself led far\r\nbeyond the scope of his original intentions, the danger in this respect\r\naugmenting in direct proportion to the wish of the inquirer to render\r\nhis knowledge solid and complete.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A BOY'S BOOK.]\r\n\r\nWhen the idea of writing this book first occurred to me, it was not my\r\nintention to confine myself to the glaciers alone, but to make the work\r\na vehicle for the familiar explanation of such general physical\r\nphenomena as had come under my notice. Nor did I intend to address it to\r\na cultured man of science, but to a youth of average intelligence, and\r\nfurnished with the education which England now offers to the young. I\r\nwished indeed to make it a boy's class-book, which should reveal the\r\nmode of life, as well as the scientific objects, of an explorer of the\r\nAlps. The incidents of the past year have caused me to deviate, in some\r\ndegree, from this intention, but its traces will be sufficiently\r\nmanifest; and this reference to it will, I trust, excuse an occasional\r\nliberty of style and simplicity of treatment which would be out of place\r\nif intended for a reader of riper years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Mr. Sorby has drawn my attention to an able and interesting paper by\r\nM. Bauer, in Karsten's 'Archiv' for 1846; in which it is announced that\r\ncleavage is a tension of the mass _produced by pressure_. The author\r\nrefers to the experiments of Mr. Hopkins as bearing upon the question.\r\n\r\n[B] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE OBERLAND. 1856.]\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION OF 1856.\r\n\r\nTHE OBERLAND.\r\n\r\n(2.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August, 1856, I received my Alpenstock from the hands of\r\nDr. Hooker, in the garden of the Pension Ober, at Interlaken. It bore my\r\nname, not marked, however, by the vulgar brands of the country, but by\r\nthe solar beams which had been converged upon it by the pocket lens of\r\nmy friend. I was the companion of Mr. Huxley, and our first aim was to\r\ncross the Wengern Alp. Light and shadow enriched the crags and green\r\nslopes as we advanced up the valley of Lauterbrunnen, and each occupied\r\nhimself with that which most interested him. My companion examined the\r\ndrift, I the cleavage, while both of us looked with interest at the\r\ncontortions of the strata to our left, and at the shadowy, unsubstantial\r\naspect of the pines, gleaming through the sunhaze to our right.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOLDED ROCKS. 1856.]\r\n\r\nWhat was the physical condition of the rock when it was thus bent and\r\nfolded like a pliant mass? Was it necessarily softer than it is at\r\npresent? I do not think so. The shock which would crush a railway\r\ncarriage, if communicated to it at once, is harmless when distributed\r\nover the interval necessary for the pushing in of the buffer. By\r\nsuddenly stopping a cock from which water flows you may burst the\r\nconveyance pipe, while a slow turning of the cock keeps all safe. Might\r\nnot a solid rock by ages of pressure be folded as above? It is a\r\nphysical axiom that no body is perfectly hard, none perfectly soft, none\r\nperfectly elastic. The hardest body subjected to pressure yields,\r\nhowever little, and the same body when the pressure is removed cannot\r\nreturn to its original form. If it did not yield in the slightest degree\r\nit would be perfectly hard; if it could completely return to its\r\noriginal shape it would be perfectly elastic.\r\n\r\nLet a pound weight be placed upon a cube of granite; the cube is\r\nflattened, though in an infinitesimal degree. Let the weight be removed,\r\nthe cube _remains_ a little flattened; it cannot quite return to its\r\nprimitive condition. Let us call the cube thus flattened No. 1. Starting\r\nwith No. 1 as a new mass, let the pound weight be laid upon it; the mass\r\nyields, and on removing the weight it cannot return to the dimensions of\r\nNo. 1; we have a more flattened mass, No. 2. Proceeding in this manner,\r\nit is manifest that by a repetition of the process we should produce a\r\nseries of masses, each succeeding one more flattened than the former.\r\nThis appears to be a necessary consequence of the physical axiom\r\nreferred to above.\r\n\r\nNow if, instead of removing and replacing the weight in the manner\r\nsupposed, we cause it to rest continuously upon the cube, the\r\nflattening, which above was intermittent, will be continuous; no matter\r\nhow hard the cube may be, there will be a gradual yielding of its mass\r\nunder the pressure. Apply this to squeezed rocks--to those, for example,\r\nwhich form the base of an obelisk like the Matterhorn; that this base\r\nmust yield, seems a certain consequence of the physical constitution of\r\nmatter: the conclusion seems inevitable that the mountain is sinking by\r\nits own weight. Let two points be fixed, one near the summit, the other\r\nnear the base of the obelisk; next year these points will have\r\napproached each other. Whether the amount of approach in a human\r\nlifetime be measureable we know not; but it seems certain that ages\r\nwould leave their impress upon the mass, and render visible to the eye\r\nan action which at present is appreciable by the imagination only.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE JUNGFRAU AND SILBERHORN. 1856.]\r\n\r\nWe halted on the night of the 16th at the Jungfrau Hotel, and next\r\nmorning we saw the beams of the rising sun fall upon the peaked snow of\r\nthe Silberhorn. Slowly and solemnly the pure white cone appeared to rise\r\nhigher and higher into the sunlight, being afterwards mottled with gold\r\nand gloom, as clouds drifted between it and the sun. I descended alone\r\ntowards the base of the mountain, making my way through a rugged gorge,\r\nthe sides of which were strewn with pine-trees, splintered, broken\r\nacross, and torn up by the roots. I finally reached the end of a\r\nglacier, formed by the snow and shattered ice which fall from the\r\nshoulders of the Jungfrau. The view from this place had a savage\r\nmagnificence such as I had not previously beheld, and it was not without\r\nsome slight feeling of awe that I clambered up the end of the glacier.\r\nIt was the first I had actually stood upon. The loneliness of the place\r\nwas very impressive, the silence being only broken by fitful gusts of\r\nwind, or by the weird rattle of the debris which fell at intervals from\r\nthe melting ice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AVALANCHES. 1856.]\r\n\r\nOnce I noticed what appeared to be the sudden and enormous augmentation\r\nof the waters of a cascade, but the sound soon informed me that the\r\nincrease was due to an avalanche which had chosen the track of the\r\ncascade for its rush. Soon afterwards my eyes were fixed upon a white\r\nslope some thousands of feet above me; I saw the ice give way, and,\r\nafter a sensible interval, the thunder of another avalanche reached me.\r\nA kind of zigzag channel had been worn on the side of the mountain, and\r\nthrough this the avalanche rushed, hidden at intervals, and anon\r\nshooting forth, and leaping like a cataract down the precipices. The\r\nsound was sometimes continuous, but sometimes broken into rounded\r\nexplosions which seemed to assert a passionate predominance over the\r\ngeneral level of the roar. These avalanches, when they first give way,\r\nusually consist of enormous blocks of ice, which are more and more\r\nshattered as they descend. Partly to the echoes of the first crash, but\r\nmainly, I think, to the shock of the harder masses which preserve their\r\ncohesion, the explosions which occur during the descent of the avalanche\r\nare to be ascribed. Much of the ice is crushed to powder; and thus, when\r\nan avalanche pours cataract-like over a ledge, the heavier masses, being\r\nless influenced by the atmospheric resistance, shoot forward like\r\ndescending rockets, leaving the lighter powder in trains behind them.\r\nSuch is the material of which a class of the smaller glaciers in the\r\nAlps is composed. They are the products of avalanches, the crushed ice\r\nbeing recompacted into a solid mass, which exhibits on a smaller scale\r\nmost of the characteristics of the large glaciers.\r\n\r\nAfter three hours' absence I reascended to the hotel, breakfasted, and\r\nafterwards returned with Mr. Huxley to the glacier. While we were\r\nengaged upon it the weather suddenly changed; lightning flashed about\r\nthe summits of the Jungfrau, and thunder \"leaped\" among her crags. Heavy\r\nrain fell, but it cleared up afterwards with magical speed, and we\r\nreturned to our hotel. Heedless of the forebodings of many prophets of\r\nevil weather we set out for Grindelwald. The scene from the summit of\r\nthe Little Scheideck was exceedingly grand. The upper air exhibited a\r\ncommotion which we did not experience; clouds were wildly driven against\r\nthe flanks of the Eiger, the Jungfrau thundered behind, while in front\r\nof us a magnificent rainbow, fixing one of its arms in the valley of\r\nGrindelwald, and, throwing the other right over the crown of the\r\nWetterhorn, clasped the mountain in its embrace. Through jagged\r\napertures in the clouds floods of golden light were poured down the\r\nsides of the mountain. On the slopes were innumerable chalets,\r\nglistening in the sunbeams, herds browsing peacefully and shaking their\r\nmellow bells; while the blackness of the pine-trees, crowded into\r\nwoods, or scattered in pleasant clusters over alp and valley, contrasted\r\nforcibly with the lively green of the fields.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HEISSE PLATTE. 1856.]\r\n\r\nAt Grindelwald, on the 18th, we engaged a strong and competent guide,\r\nnamed Christian Kaufmann, and proceeded to the Lower Glacier. After a\r\nsteep ascent, we gained a point from which we could look down upon the\r\nfrozen mass. At first the ice presented an appearance of utter\r\nconfusion, but we soon reached a position where the mechanical\r\nconditions of the glacier revealed themselves, and where we might learn,\r\nhad we not known it before, that confusion is merely the unknown\r\nintermixture of laws, and becomes order and beauty when we rise to their\r\ncomprehension. We reached the so-called Eismeer--Ice Sea. In front of us\r\nwas the range of the Viescherhoerner, and a vast snow slope, from which\r\none branch of the glacier was fed. Near the base of this _neve_, and\r\nsurrounded on all sides by ice, lay a brown rock, to which our attention\r\nwas directed as a place noted for avalanches; on this rock snow or ice\r\nnever rests, and it is hence called the _Heisse Platte_--the Hot Plate.\r\nAt the base of the rock, and far below it, the glacier was covered with\r\nclean crushed ice, which had fallen from a crown of frozen cliffs\r\nencircling the brow of the rock. One obelisk in particular signalised\r\nitself from all others by its exceeding grace and beauty. Its general\r\nsurface was dazzling white, but from its clefts and fissures issued a\r\ndelicate blue light, which deepened in hue from the edges inwards. It\r\nstood upon a pedestal of its own substance, and seemed as accurately\r\nfixed as if rule and plummet had been employed in its erection. Fig. 1\r\nrepresents this beautiful minaret of ice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ICE MINARET. 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Ice Minaret.]\r\n\r\nWhile we were in sight of the Heisse Platte, a dozen avalanches rushed\r\ndownwards from its summit. In most cases we were informed of the descent\r\nof an avalanche by the sound, but sometimes the white mass was seen\r\ngliding down the rock, and scattering its _smoke_ in the air, long\r\nbefore the sound reached us. It is difficult to reconcile the\r\ninsignificant appearance presented by avalanches, when seen from a\r\ndistance, with the volume of sound which they generate; but on this day\r\nwe saw sufficient to account for the noise. One block of solid ice which\r\nwe found below the Heisse Platte measured 7 feet 6 inches in length, 5\r\nfeet 8 inches in height, and 4 feet 6 inches in depth. A second mass was\r\n10 feet long, 8 feet high, and 6 feet wide. It contained therefore 480\r\ncubic feet of ice, which had been cast to a distance of nearly 1000\r\nyards down the glacier. The shock of such hard and ponderous projectiles\r\nagainst rocks and ice, reinforced by the echoes from the surrounding\r\nmountains, will appear sufficient to account for the peals by which\r\ntheir descent is accompanied.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ECHOES OF THE WETTERHORN. 1856.]\r\n\r\nA second day, in company with Dr. Hooker, completed the examination of\r\nthis glacier in 1856; after which I parted from my friends, Mr. Huxley\r\nintending to rejoin me at the Grimsel. On the morning of the 20th of\r\nAugust I strapped on my knapsack and ascended the green slopes from\r\nGrindelwald towards the Great Scheideck. Before reaching the summit I\r\nfrequently heard the wonderful echoes of the Wetterhorn. Some travellers\r\nwere in advance of me, and to amuse them an alpine horn was blown. The\r\ndirect sound was cut off from me by a hill, but the echoes talked down\r\nto me from the mountain walls. The sonorous waves arrived after one,\r\ntwo, three, and more reflections, diminishing gradually in intensity,\r\nbut increasing in softness, as if in its wanderings from crag to crag\r\nthe sound had undergone a kind of sifting process, leaving all its\r\ngrossness behind, and returning in delightful flute notes to the ear.\r\n\r\nLet us investigate this point a little. If two looking-glasses be placed\r\nperfectly parallel to each other, with a lighted candle between them, an\r\ninfinite series of images of the candle will be seen at both sides, the\r\nimages diminishing in brightness the further they recede. But if the\r\nlooking-glasses, instead of being parallel, enclose an angle, a limited\r\nnumber of images only will be seen. The smaller the angle which the\r\nreflectors make with each other, or, in other words, the nearer they\r\napproach parallelism, the greater will be the number of images observed.\r\n\r\nTo find the number of images the following is the rule:--Divide 360, or\r\nthe number of degrees in a circle, by the number of degrees in the angle\r\nenclosed by the two mirrors, the quotient will be _one more_ than the\r\nnumber of images; or, counting the object itself, the quotient is always\r\nequal to the number of images plus the object. In Fig. 2 I have given\r\nthe number and position of the images produced by two mirrors placed at\r\nan angle of 45 deg. A B and B C mark the edges of the mirrors, and 0\r\nrepresents the candle, which, for the sake of simplicity, I have placed\r\nmidway between them. Fix one point of a pair of compasses at B, and with\r\nthe distance B 0 sweep a circle:--_all the images will be ranged upon\r\nthe circumference of this circle_. The number of images found by the\r\nforegoing rule is 7, and their positions are marked in the figure by the\r\nnumbers 1, 2, 3, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Diagram of an angular reflector.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ECHOES EXPLAINED. 1856.]\r\n\r\nSuppose the _ear_ to occupy the place of the eye, and that _a sounding\r\nbody_ occupies the place of the luminous one, we should then have just\r\nas many _echoes_ as we had _images_ in the former case. These echoes\r\nwould diminish in loudness just as the images of the candle diminish in\r\nbrightness. At each reflection a portion both of sound and light is\r\nlost; hence the oftener light is reflected the dimmer it becomes, and\r\nthe oftener sound is reflected the fainter it is.\r\n\r\nNow the cliffs of the Wetterhorn are so many rough angular reflectors of\r\nthe sound: some of them send it back directly to the listener, and we\r\nhave a first echo; some of them send it on to others from which it is\r\nagain reflected, forming a second echo. Thus, by repeated reflection,\r\nsuccessive echoes are sent to the ear, until, at length, they become so\r\nfaint as to be inaudible. The sound, as it diminishes in intensity,\r\nappears to come from greater and greater distances, as if it were\r\nreceding into the mountain solitudes; the final echoes being\r\ninexpressibly soft and pure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REICHENBACH AND HANDECK. 1856.]\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Scheideck I descended to Meyringen, visiting the\r\nReichenbach waterfall on my way. A peculiarity of the descending water\r\nhere is, that it is broken up in one of the basins into nodular masses,\r\neach of which in falling leaves the light foaming mass which surrounds\r\nit as a train in the air behind; the effect exactly resembles that of\r\nthe avalanches of the Jungfrau, in which the more solid blocks of ice\r\nshoot forward in advance of the lighter debris, which is held back by\r\nthe friction of the air.\r\n\r\nNext day I ascended the valley of Hasli, and observed upon the rocks and\r\nmountains the action of ancient glaciers which once filled the valley to\r\nthe height of more than a thousand feet above its present level. I\r\npaused, of course, at the waterfall of Handeck, and stood for a time\r\nupon the wooden bridge which spans the river at its top. The Aar comes\r\ngambolling down to the bridge from its parent glacier, takes one short\r\njump upon a projecting ledge, boils up into foam, and then leaps into a\r\nchasm, from the bottom of which its roar ascends through the gloom. A\r\nrivulet named the Aarlenbach joins the Aar from the left in the very\r\njaws of the chasm: falling, at first, upon a projection at some depth\r\nbelow the edge, and, rebounding from this, it darts at the Aar, and both\r\nplunge together like a pair of fighting demons to the bottom of the\r\ngorge. The foam of the Aarlenbach is white, that of the Aar is yellow,\r\nand this enables the observer to trace the passage of the one cataract\r\n_through_ the other. As I stood upon the bridge the sun shone brightly\r\nupon the spray and foam; my shadow was oblique to the river, and hence a\r\nsymmetrical rainbow could not be formed in the spray, but one half of a\r\nlovely bow, with its base in the chasm, leaned over against the opposite\r\nrocks, the colours advancing and retreating as the spray shifted its\r\nposition. I had been watching the water intently for some time, when a\r\nlittle Swiss boy, who stood beside me, observed, in his trenchant\r\nGerman, \"There plunge stones ever downwards.\" The stones were palpable\r\nenough, carried down by the cataract, and sometimes completely breaking\r\nloose from it, but I did not see them until my attention was withdrawn\r\nfrom the water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HUT OF M. DOLLFUSS. 1856.]\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at the Grimsel I found Mr. Huxley already there, and,\r\nafter a few minutes' conversation, we decided to spend a night in a hut\r\nbuilt by M. Dollfuss in 1846, beside the Unteraar glacier, about 2000\r\nfeet above the Hospice. We hoped thus to be able to examine the glacier\r\nto its origin on the following day. Two days' food and some blankets\r\nwere sent up from the Hospice, and, accompanied by our guide, we\r\nproceeded to the glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOTEL DES NEUFCHATELOIS. 1856.]\r\n\r\nHaving climbed a great terminal moraine, and tramped for a considerable\r\ntime amid loose shingle and boulders, we came upon the ice. The finest\r\nspecimens of \"tables\" which I have ever seen are to be found upon this\r\nglacier--huge masses of clean granite poised on pedestals of ice. Here\r\nare also \"dirt-cones\" of the largest size, and numerous shafts, the\r\nforsaken passages of ancient \"moulins,\" some filled with water, others\r\nsimply with deep blue light. I reserve the description and explanation\r\nof both cones and moulins for another place. The surfaces of some of the\r\nsmall pools were sprinkled lightly over with snow, which the water\r\nunderneath was unable to melt; a coating of snow granules was thus\r\nformed, flexible as chain armour, but so close that the air could not\r\nescape through it. Some bubbles which had risen through the water had\r\nlifted the coating here and there into little rounded domes, which, by\r\ngentle pressure, could be shifted hither and thither, and several of\r\nthem collected into one. We reached the hut, the floor of which appeared\r\nto be of the original mountain slab; there was a space for cooking\r\nwalled off from the sleeping-room, half of which was raised above the\r\nfloor, and contained a quantity of old hay. The number 2404 metres, the\r\nheight, I suppose, of the place above the sea, was painted on the\r\ndoor, behind which were also the names of several well-known\r\nobservers--Agassiz, Forbes, Desor, Dollfuss, Ramsay, and others--cut in\r\nthe wood. A loft contained a number of instruments for boring, a\r\nsurveyor's chain, ropes, and other matters. After dinner I made my way\r\nalone towards the junction of the Finsteraar and Lauteraar glaciers,\r\nwhich unite at the Abschwung to form the trunk stream of the Unteraar\r\nglacier. Upon the great central moraine which runs between the branches\r\nwere perched enormous masses of rock, and, under the overhanging ledge\r\nof one of these, M. Agassiz had his _Hotel des Neufchatelois_. The rock\r\nis still there, bearing traces of names now nearly obliterated by the\r\nweather, while the fragments around also bear inscriptions. There in the\r\nwilderness, in the gray light of evening, these blurred and faded\r\nevidences of human activity wore an aspect of sadness. It was a temple\r\nof science now in ruins, and I a solitary pilgrim to the desecrated\r\nblocks. As the day declined, rain began to fall, and I turned my face\r\ntowards my new home; where in due time we betook ourselves to our hay,\r\nand waited hopefully for the morning.\r\n\r\nBut our hopes were doomed to disappointment. A vast quantity of snow\r\nfell during the night, and, when we arose, we found the glacier covered,\r\nand the air thick with the descending flakes. We waited, hoping that it\r\nmight clear up, but noon arrived and passed without improvement; our\r\nfire-wood was exhausted, the weather intensely cold, and, according to\r\nthe men's opinion, hopelessly bad; they opposed the idea of ascending\r\nfurther, and we had therefore no alternative but to pack up and move\r\ndownwards. What was snow at the higher elevations changed to rain lower\r\ndown, and drenched us completely before we reached the Grimsel. But\r\nthough thus partially foiled in our design, this visit taught us much\r\nregarding the structure and general phenomena of the glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE RHONE GLACIER. 1856.]\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 24th was clear and calm: we rose with the sun,\r\nrefreshed and strong, and crossed the Grimsel pass at an early hour. The\r\nview from the summit of the pass was lovely in the extreme; the sky a\r\ndeep blue, the surrounding summits all enamelled with the newly-fallen\r\nsnow, which gleamed with dazzling whiteness in the sunlight. It was\r\nSunday, and the scene was itself a Sabbath, with no sound to disturb its\r\nperfect rest. In a lake which we passed the mountains were mirrored\r\nwithout distortion, for there was no motion of the air to ruffle its\r\nsurface. From the summit of the Mayenwand we looked down upon the Rhone\r\nglacier, and a noble object it seemed,--I hardly know a finer of its\r\nkind in the Alps. Forcing itself through the narrow gorge which holds\r\nthe ice cascade in its jaws, and where it is greatly riven and\r\ndislocated, it spreads out in the valley below in such a manner as\r\nclearly to reveal to the mind's eye the nature of the forces to which it\r\nis subjected. Longfellow's figure is quite correct; the glacier\r\nresembles a vast gauntlet, of which the gorge represents the wrist;\r\nwhile the lower glacier, cleft by its fissures into finger-like ridges,\r\nis typified by the hand.\r\n\r\nFurnishing ourselves with provisions at the adjacent inn, we devoted\r\nsome hours to the examination of the lower portion of the glacier. The\r\ndirt upon its surface was arranged in grooves as fine as if produced by\r\nthe passage of a rake, while the laminated structure of the deeper ice\r\nalways corresponded to the superficial grooving. We found several\r\nshafts, some empty, some filled with water. At one place our attention\r\nwas attracted by a singular noise, evidently produced by the forcing of\r\nair and water through passages in the body of the glacier; the sound\r\nrose and fell for several minutes, like a kind of intermittent snore,\r\nreminding one of Hugi's hypothesis that the glacier was alive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RINGS AROUND THE SUN. 1856.]\r\n\r\nWe afterwards climbed to a point from which the whole glacier was\r\nvisible to us from its origin to its end. Adjacent to us rose the mighty\r\nmass of the Finsteraarhorn, the monarch of the Oberland. The Galenstock\r\nwas also at hand, while round about the _neve_ of the glacier a mountain\r\nwall projected its jagged outline against the sky. At a distance was the\r\ngrand cone of the Weisshorn, then, and I believe still, unscaled;[A]\r\nfurther to the left the magnificent peaks of the Mischabel; while\r\nbetween them, in savage isolation, stood the obelisk of the Matterhorn.\r\nNear us was the chain of the Furca, all covered with shining snow, while\r\noverhead the dark blue of the firmament so influenced the general scene\r\nas to inspire a sentiment of wonder approaching to awe. We descended to\r\nthe glacier, and proceeded towards its source. As we advanced an unusual\r\nlight fell upon the mountains, and looking upwards we saw a series of\r\ncoloured rings, drawn like a vivid circular rainbow quite round the sun.\r\nBetween the orb and us spread a thin veil of cloud on which the circles\r\nwere painted; the western side of the veil soon melted away, and with it\r\nthe colours, but the eastern half remained a quarter of an hour longer,\r\nand then in its turn disappeared. The crevasses became more frequent and\r\ndangerous as we ascended. They were usually furnished with overhanging\r\neaves of snow, from which long icicles depended, and to tread on which\r\nmight be fatal. We were near the source of the glacier, but the time\r\nnecessary to reach it was nevertheless indefinite, so great was the\r\nentanglement of fissures. We followed one huge chasm for some hundreds\r\nof yards, hoping to cross it; but after half an hour's fruitless effort\r\nwe found ourselves baffled and forced to retrace our steps.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPIRIT OF THE BROCKEN. 1856.]\r\n\r\nThe sun was sloping to the west, and we thought it wise to return; so\r\ndown the glacier we went, mingling our footsteps with the tracks of\r\nchamois, while the frightened marmots piped incessantly from the rocks.\r\nWe reached the land once more, and halted for a time to look upon the\r\nscene within view. The marvellous blueness of the sky in the earlier\r\npart of the day indicated that the air was charged, almost to\r\nsaturation, with transparent aqueous vapour. As the sun sank the shadow\r\nof the Finsteraarhorn was cast through the adjacent atmosphere, which,\r\nthus deprived of the direct rays, curdled up into visible fog. The\r\ncondensed vapour moved slowly along the flanks of the mountain, and\r\npoured itself cataract-like into the valley of the Rhone. Here it met\r\nthe sun again, which reduced it once more to the invisible state. Thus,\r\nthough there was an incessant supply from the generator behind, the fog\r\nmade no progress; as in the case of the moving glacier, the end of the\r\ncloud-river remained stationary where consumption was equal to supply.\r\nProceeding along the mountain to the Furca, we found the valley at the\r\nfurther side of the pass also filled with fog, which rose, like a wall,\r\nhigh above the region of actual shadow. Once on turning a corner an\r\nexclamation of surprise burst simultaneously from my companion and\r\nmyself. Before each of us and against the wall of fog, stood a spectral\r\nimage of a man, of colossal dimensions; dark as a whole, but bounded by\r\na coloured outline. We stretched forth our arms; the spectres did the\r\nsame. We raised our alpenstocks; the spectres also flourished their\r\nbatons. All our actions were imitated by these fringed and gigantic\r\nshades. We had, in fact, _the Spirit of the Brocken_ before us in\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nAt the time here referred to I had had but little experience of alpine\r\nphenomena. I had been through the Oberland in 1850, but was then too\r\nignorant to learn much from my excursion. Hence the novelty of this\r\nday's experience may have rendered it impressive: still even now I think\r\nthere was an intrinsic grandeur in its phenomena which entitles the day\r\nto rank with the most remarkable that I have spent among the Alps. At\r\nthe Furca, to my great regret, the joint ramblings of my friend and\r\nmyself ended; I parted from him on the mountain side, and watched him\r\ndescending, till the gray of evening finally hid him from my view.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The Weisshorn was first scaled, by Tyndall, in 1861.--L. C. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TYROL. 1856.]\r\n\r\nTHE TYROL.\r\n\r\n(3.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy subsequent destination was Vienna; but I wished to associate with my\r\njourney thither a visit to some of the glaciers of the Tyrol. At\r\nLandeck, on the 29th of August, I learned that the nearest glacier was\r\nthat adjacent to the Gebatsch Alp, at the head of the Kaunserthal; and\r\non the following morning I was on my way towards this valley. I sought\r\nto obtain a guide at Kaltebrunnen, but failed; and afterwards walked to\r\nthe little hamlet of Feuchten, where I put up at a very lonely inn. My\r\nhost, I believe, had never seen an Englishman, but he had heard of such,\r\nand remarked to me in his patois with emphasis, \"_Die Englaender sind die\r\nkuehnsten Leute in dieser Welt._\" Through his mediation I secured a\r\nchamois-hunter, named Johann Auer, to be my guide, and next morning I\r\nstarted with this man up the valley. The sun, as we ascended, smote the\r\nearth and us with great power; high mountains flanked us on either side,\r\nwhile in front of us, closing the view, was the mass of the Weisskugel,\r\ncovered with snow. At three o'clock we came in sight of the glacier,\r\nand soon afterwards I made the acquaintance of the _Senner_ or\r\ncheesemakers of the Gebatsch Alp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GEBATSCH ALP. 1856.]\r\n\r\nThe chief of these was a fine tall fellow, with free, frank countenance,\r\nwhich, however, had a dash of the mountain wildness in it. His feet were\r\nbare, he wore breeches, and fragments of stockings partially covered his\r\nlegs, leaving a black zone between the upper rim of the sock and the\r\nbreeches. His feet and face were of the same swarthy hue; still he was\r\nhandsome, and in a measure pleasant to look upon. He asked me what he\r\ncould cook for me, and I requested some bread and milk; the former was a\r\nmonth old, the latter was fresh and delicious, and on these I fared\r\nsumptuously. I went to the glacier afterwards with my guide, and\r\nremained upon the ice until twilight, when we returned, guided by no\r\npath, but passing amid crags grasped by the gnarled roots of the pine,\r\nthrough green dells, and over bilberry knolls of exquisite colouring. My\r\nguide kept in advance of me singing a Tyrolese melody, and his song and\r\nthe surrounding scene revived and realised all the impressions of my\r\nboyhood regarding the Tyrol.\r\n\r\nMilking was over when we returned to the chalet, which now contained\r\nfour men exclusive of myself and my guide. A fire of pine logs was made\r\nupon a platform of stone, elevated three feet above the floor; there was\r\nno chimney, as the smoke found ample vent through the holes and fissures\r\nin the sides and roof. The men were all intensely sunburnt, the\r\nlegitimate brown deepening into black with beard and dirt. The chief\r\nsenner prepared supper, breaking eggs into a dish, and using his black\r\nfingers to empty the shell when the albumen was refractory. A fine erect\r\nfigure he was as he stood in the glowing light of the fire. All the men\r\nwere smoking, and now and then a brand was taken from the fire to light\r\na renewed pipe, and a ruddy glare flung thereby over the wild\r\ncountenance of the smoker. In one corner of the chalet, and raised high\r\nabove the ground, was a large bed, covered with clothes of the most\r\ndubious black-brown hue; at one end was a little water-wheel turned by a\r\nbrook, which communicated motion to a churndash which made the butter.\r\nThe beams and rafters were covered with cheeses, drying in the warm\r\nsmoke. The senner, at my request, showed me his storeroom, and explained\r\nto me the process of making cheese, its interest to me consisting in its\r\nbearing upon the question of slaty cleavage. Three gigantic masses of\r\nbutter were in the room, and I amused my host by calling them\r\nbutter-glaciers. Soon afterwards a bit of cotton was stuck in a lump of\r\ngrease, which was placed in a lantern, and the wick ignited; the\r\nchamois-hunter took it, and led the way to our resting-place, I having\r\npreviously declined a good-natured invitation to sleep in the big black\r\nbed already referred to.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN ALPINE CHALET. 1856.]\r\n\r\nThere was a cowhouse near the chalet, and above it, raised on pillars of\r\npine, and approached by a ladder, was a loft, which contained a quantity\r\nof dry hay: this my guide shook to soften the lumps, and erected an\r\neminence for my head. I lay down, drawing my plaid over me, but Auer\r\naffirmed that this would not be a sufficient protection against the\r\ncold; he therefore piled hay upon me to the shoulders, and proposed\r\ncovering up my head also. This, however, I declined, though the biting\r\ncoldness of the air, which sometimes blew in upon us, afterwards proved\r\nto me the wisdom of the suggestion. Having set me right, my\r\nchamois-hunter prepared a place for himself, and soon his heavy\r\nbreathing informed me that he was in a state of bliss which I could only\r\nenvy. One by one the stars crossed the apertures in the roof. Once the\r\nPleiades hung above me like a cluster of gems; I tried to admire them,\r\nbut there was no fervour in my admiration. Sometimes I dozed, but\r\nalways as this was about to deepen into positive sleep it was rudely\r\nbroken by the clamour of a group of pigs which occupied the ground-floor\r\nof our dwelling. The object of each individual of the group was to\r\nsecure for himself the maximum amount of heat, and hence the outside\r\nmembers were incessantly trying to become inside ones. It was the\r\nstruggle of radical and conservative among the pachyderms, the politics\r\nbeing determined by the accident of position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GEBATSCH GLACIER. 1856.]\r\n\r\nI rose at five o'clock on the 1st of September, and after a breakfast of\r\nblack bread and milk ascended the glacier as far as practicable. We once\r\nquitted it, crossed a promontory, and descended upon one of its\r\nbranches, which was flanked by some fine old moraines. We here came upon\r\na group of seven marmots, which with yells of terror scattered\r\nthemselves among the rocks. The points of the glacier beyond my reach I\r\nexamined through a telescope; along the faces of the sections the lines\r\nof stratification were clearly shown; and in many places where the mass\r\nshowed manifest signs of lateral pressure, I thought I could observe the\r\ncleavage passing though the strata. The point, however, was too\r\nimportant to rest upon an observation made from such a distance, and I\r\ntherefore abstained from mentioning it subsequently. I examined the\r\nfissures and the veining, and noticed how the latter became most perfect\r\nin places where the pressure was greatest. The effect of _oblique_\r\npressure was also finely shown: at one place the thrust of the\r\ndescending glacier was opposed by the resistance offered by the side of\r\nthe valley, the direction of the force being oblique to the side; the\r\nconsequence was a structure nearly parallel to the valley, and\r\nconsequently oblique to the thrust which I believe to be its cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A CHAMOIS ON THE ROCKS. 1856.]\r\n\r\nAfter five hours' examination we returned to our chalet, where we\r\nrefreshed ourselves, put our things in order, and faced a nameless\r\n\"Joch,\" or pass; our aim being to cross the mountains into the valley of\r\nLantaufer, and reach Graun that evening. After a rough ascent over the\r\nalp we came to the dead crag, where the weather had broken up the\r\nmountains into ruinous heaps of rock and shingle. We reached the end of\r\na glacier, the ice of which was covered by sloppy snow, and at some\r\ndistance up it came upon an islet of stones and debris, where we paused\r\nto rest ourselves. My guide, as usual, ranged over the summits with his\r\ntelescope, and at length exclaimed, \"I see a chamois.\" The creature\r\nstood upon a cliff some hundreds of yards to our left, and seemed to\r\nwatch our movements. It was a most graceful animal, and its life and\r\nbeauty stood out in forcible antithesis to the surrounding savagery and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nOn the steep slopes of the glacier I was assisted by the hand of my\r\nguide. In fact, on this day I deemed places dangerous, and dreaded them\r\nas such, which subsequent practice enabled me to regard with perfect\r\nindifference; so much does what we call courage depend upon habit, or on\r\nthe fact of knowing that we have really nothing to fear. Doubtless there\r\nare times when a climber has to make up his mind for very unpleasant\r\npossibilities, and even gather calmness from the contemplation of the\r\nworst; but in most cases I should say that his courage is derived from\r\nthe latent feeling that the chances of safety are immensely in his\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PASSAGE OF A JOCH. 1856.]\r\n\r\nAfter a tough struggle we reached the narrow row of crags which form the\r\ncrest of the pass, and looked into the world of mountain and cloud on\r\nthe other side. The scene was one of stern grandeur--the misty lights\r\nand deep cloud-glooms being so disposed as to augment the impression of\r\nvastness which the scene conveyed. The breeze at the summit was\r\nexceedingly keen, but it gave our muscles tone, and we sprang swiftly\r\ndownward through the yielding debris which here overlies the mountain,\r\nand in which we sometimes sank to the knees. Lower down we came once\r\nmore upon the ice. The glacier had at one place melted away from its\r\nbounding cliff, which rose vertically to our right, while a wall of ice\r\n60 or 80 feet high was on our left. Between the two was a narrow\r\npassage, the floor of which was snow, which I knew to be hollow beneath:\r\nmy companion, however, was in advance of me, and he being the heavier\r\nman, where he trod I followed without hesitation. On turning an angle of\r\nthe rock I noticed an expression of concern upon his countenance, and he\r\nmuttered audibly, \"I did not expect this.\" The snow-floor had, in fact,\r\ngiven way, and exposed to view a clear green lake, one boundary of which\r\nwas a sheer precipice of rock, and the other the aforesaid wall of ice;\r\nthe latter, however, curved a little at its base, so as to form a short\r\nsteep slope which overhung the water. My guide first tried the slope\r\nalone; biting the ice with his shoe-nails, and holding on by the spike\r\nof his baton, he reached the other side. He then returned, and,\r\ndivesting myself of all superfluous clothes, as a preparation for the\r\nplunge which I fully expected, I also passed in safety. Probably the\r\nconsciousness that I had water to fall into instead of pure space,\r\nenabled me to get across without anxiety or mischance; but had I, like\r\nmy guide, been unable to swim, my feelings would have been far\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThis accomplished, we went swiftly down the valley, and the more I saw\r\nof my guide the more I liked him. He might, if he wished, have made his\r\nday's journey shorter by stopping before he reached Graun, but he would\r\nnot do so. Every word he said to me regarding distances was true, and\r\nthere was not the slightest desire shown to magnify his own labour. I\r\nlearnt by mere accident that the day's work had cut up his feet, but his\r\ncheerfulness and energy did not bate a jot till he had landed me in the\r\nBlack Eagle at Graun. Next morning he came to my room, and said that he\r\nfelt sufficiently refreshed to return home. I paid him what I owed him,\r\nwhen he took my hand, and, silently bending down his head, kissed it;\r\nthen, standing erect, he stretched forth his right hand, which I grasped\r\nfirmly in mine, and bade him farewell; and thus I parted from Johann\r\nAuer, my brave and truthful chamois-hunter.\r\n\r\nOn the following day I met Dr. Frankland in the Finstermuntz pass, and\r\nthat night we bivouacked together at Mals. Heavy rain fell throughout\r\nthe night, but it came from a region high above that of liquidity. It\r\nwas first snow, which, as it descended through the warmer strata of the\r\natmosphere, was reduced to water. Overhead, in the air, might be traced\r\na surface, below which the precipitate was liquid, above which it was\r\nsolid; and this surface, intersecting the mountains which surround Mals,\r\nmarked upon them a beautifully-defined _snow-line_, below which the\r\npines were dark and the pastures green, but above which pines and\r\npastures and crags were covered with the freshly-fallen snow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE STELVIO. 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COLOUR OF FRESH SNOW. 1856.]\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of September we crossed the Stelvio. The brown cone of the\r\nwell-known Madatschspitze was clear, but the higher summits were\r\nclouded, and the fragments of sunshine which reached the lower world\r\nwandered like gleams of fluorescent light over the glaciers. Near the\r\nsnow-line the partial melting of the snow had rendered it coarsely\r\ngranular, but as we ascended it became finer, and the light emitted from\r\nits cracks and cavities a pure and deep blue. When a staff was driven\r\ninto the snow low down the mountain, the colour of the light in the\r\norifice was scarcely sensibly blue, but higher up this increased in a\r\nwonderful degree, and at the summit the effect was marvellous. I struck\r\nmy staff into the snow, and turned it round and round; the surrounding\r\nsnow cracked repeatedly, and flashes of blue light issued from the\r\nfissures. The fragments of snow that adhered to the staff were, by\r\ncontrast, of a beautiful pink yellow, so that, on moving the staff with\r\nsuch fragments attached to it up and down, it was difficult to resist\r\nthe impression that a pink flame was ascending and descending in the\r\nhole. As we went down the other side of the pass, the effect became more\r\nand more feeble, until, near the snow-line, it almost wholly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWe remained that night at the baths of Bormio, but the following\r\nafternoon being fine we wished to avail ourselves of the fair weather to\r\nwitness the scene from the summit of the pass. Twilight came on before\r\nwe reached Santa Maria, but a gorgeous orange overspread the western\r\nhorizon, from which we hoped to derive sufficient light. It was a little\r\ntoo late when we reached the top, but still the scene was magnificent. A\r\nmultitude of mountains raised their crowns towards heaven, while above\r\nall rose the snow-white cone of the Ortler. Far into the valley the\r\ngiant stretched his granite limbs, until they were hid from us by\r\ndarkness. As this deepened, the heavens became more and more crowded\r\nwith stars, which blazed like gems over the heads of the mountains. At\r\ntimes the silence was perfect, unbroken save by the crackling of the\r\nfrozen snow beneath our own feet; while at other times a breeze would\r\nswoop down upon us, keen and hostile, scattering the snow from the roofs\r\nof the wooden galleries in frozen powder over us. Long after night had\r\nset in, a ghastly gleam rested upon the summit of the Ortler, while the\r\npeaks in front deepened to a dusky neutral tint, the more distant ones\r\nbeing lost in gloom. We descended at a swift pace to Trafoi, which we\r\nreached before 11 P.M.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SINGULAR HAILSTORM. 1856.]\r\n\r\nMeran was our next resting-place, whence we turned through the\r\nSchnalzerthal to Unserfrau, and thence over the Hochjoch to Fend. From\r\na religious procession we took a guide, who, though partly intoxicated,\r\ndid his duty well. Before reaching the summit of the pass we were\r\nassailed by a violent hailstorm, each hailstone being a frozen cone with\r\na rounded end. Had not their motion through the air something to do with\r\nthe shape of these hailstones? The theory of meteorites now generally\r\naccepted is that they are small planetary bodies drawn to the earth by\r\ngravity, and brought to incandescence by friction against the earth's\r\natmosphere. Such a body moving through the atmosphere must have\r\ncondensed hot air in front of it, and rarefied cool air behind it; and\r\nthe same is true to a small extent of a hailstone. This distribution of\r\ntemperature must, I imagine, have some influence on the shape of the\r\nstone. Possibly also the stratified appearance of some hailstones may be\r\nconnected with this action.[A]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HOCHJOCH AND FEND. 1856.]\r\n\r\nThe hail ceased and the heights above us cleared as we ascended. At the\r\ntop of the pass we found ourselves on the verge of a great _neve_, which\r\nlay between two ranges of summits, sloping down to the base of each\r\nrange from a high and rounded centre: a wilder glacier scene I have\r\nscarcely witnessed. Wishing to obtain a more perfect view of the region,\r\nI diverged from the track followed by Dr. Frankland and the guide, and\r\nclimbed a ridge of snow about half a mile to the right of them. A\r\nglorious expanse was before me, stretching itself in vast undulations,\r\nand heaping itself here and there into mountainous cones, white and\r\npure, with the deep blue heaven behind them. Here I had my first\r\nexperience of hidden crevasses, and to my extreme astonishment once\r\nfound myself in the jaws of a fissure of whose existence I had not the\r\nslightest notice. Such accidents have often occurred to me since, but\r\nthe impression made by the first is likely to remain the strongest. It\r\nwas dark when we reached the wretched Wirthshaus at Fend, where, badly\r\nfed, badly lodged, and disturbed by the noise of innumerable rats, we\r\nspent the night. Thus ended my brief glacier expedition of 1856; and on\r\nthe observations then made, and on subsequent experiments, was founded a\r\npaper presented to the Royal Society by Mr. Huxley and myself.[B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] I take the following account of a grander storm of the above\r\ncharacter from Hooker's 'Himalayan Journals,' vol. ii. p. 405.\r\n\r\n\"On the 20th (March, 1849) we had a change in the weather: a violent\r\nstorm from the south-west occurred at noon, with hail of a strange form,\r\nthe stones being sections of hollow spheres, half an inch across and\r\nupwards, formed of cones with truncated apices and convex bases: these\r\ncones were aggregated together with their bases outwards. The large\r\nmasses were followed by a shower of the separate conical pieces, and\r\nthat by heavy rain. On the mountains this storm was most severe: the\r\nstones lay at Darjeeling for seven days, congealed into masses of ice\r\nseveral feet long and a foot thick in sheltered places: at Purneah,\r\nfifty miles south, stones one and two inches across fell, probably as\r\nwhole spheres.\"\r\n\r\n[B] 'Phil. Trans.' 1857, pp. 327-346.--L. C. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LAKE OF GENEVA. 1857.]\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION OF 1857.\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE OF GENEVA.\r\n\r\n(4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time occupied in the observations of 1856 embraced about five whole\r\ndays; and though these days were laborious and instructive, still so\r\nshort a time proved to be wholly incommensurate with the claims of so\r\nwide a problem. During the subsequent experimental treatment of the\r\nsubject, I had often occasion to feel the incompleteness of my\r\nknowledge, and hence arose the desire to make a second expedition to the\r\nAlps, for the purpose of expanding, fortifying, or, if necessary,\r\ncorrecting first impressions.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 9th of July, 1857, I found myself upon the Lake of\r\nGeneva, proceeding towards Vevey. I had long wished to see the waters of\r\nthis renowned inland sea, the colour of which is perhaps more\r\ninteresting to the man of science than to the poets who have sung about\r\nit. Long ago its depth of blue excited attention, but no systematic\r\nexamination of the subject has, so far as I know, been attempted. It may\r\nbe that the lake simply exhibits the colour of pure water. Ice is blue,\r\nand it is reasonable to suppose that the liquid obtained from the fusion\r\nof ice is of the same colour; but still the question presses--\"Is the\r\nblue of the Lake of Geneva to be entirely accounted for in this way?\"\r\nThe attempts which have been made to explain it otherwise show that at\r\nleast a doubt exists as to the sufficiency of the above explanation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BLUENESS OF THE WATER. 1857.]\r\n\r\nIt is only in its deeper portions that the colour of the lake is\r\nproperly seen. Where the bottom comes into view the pure effect of the\r\nwater is disturbed; but where the water is deep the colour is deep:\r\nbetween Rolle and Nyon for example, the blue is superb. Where the blue\r\nwas deepest, however, it gave me the impression of turbidity rather than\r\nof deep transparency. At the upper portion of the lake the water through\r\nwhich the steamer passed was of a blue green. Wishing to see the place\r\nwhere the Rhone enters the lake, I walked on the morning of the 10th\r\nfrom Villeneuve to Novelle, and thence through the woods to the river\r\nside. Proceeding along an embankment, raised to defend the adjacent land\r\nfrom the incursions of the river, an hour brought me to the place where\r\nit empties itself into the lake. The contrast between the two waters was\r\nvery great: the river was almost white with the finely divided matter\r\nwhich it held in suspension; while the lake at some distance was of a\r\ndeep ultramarine.\r\n\r\nThe lake in fact forms a reservoir where the particles held in\r\nsuspension by the river have time to subside, and its waters to become\r\npure. The subsidence of course takes place most copiously at the head of\r\nthe lake; and here the deposit continues to form new land, adding year\r\nby year to the thousands of acres which it has already left behind it,\r\nand invading more and more the space occupied by the water. Innumerable\r\nplates of mica spangled the fine sand which the river brought down, and\r\nthese, mixing with the water, and flashing like minute mirrors as the\r\nsun's rays fell upon them, gave the otherwise muddy stream a silvery\r\nappearance. Had I an opportunity I would make the following\r\nexperiments:--\r\n\r\n(_a_.) Compare the colour of the light transmitted by a column of the\r\nlake water fifteen feet long with that transmitted by a second column,\r\nof the same length, derived from the melting of freshly fallen mountain\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n(_b_.) Compare in the same manner the colour of the ordinary water of\r\nthe lake with that of the same water after careful distillation.\r\n\r\n(_c_.) Strictly examine whether the light transmitted by the ordinary\r\nwater contains an excess of red over that transmitted by the distilled\r\nwater: this latter point, as will be seen farther on, is one of peculiar\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe length is fixed at fifteen feet, because I have found this length\r\nextremely efficient in similar experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3, 4. Boats' sails inverted by Atmospheric\r\nRefraction.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn returning to the pier at Villeneuve, a peculiar flickering motion was\r\nmanifest upon the surface of the distant portions of the lake, and I\r\nsoon noticed that the coast line was inverted by atmospheric refraction.\r\nIt required a long distance to produce the effect: no trace of it was\r\nseen about the Castle of Chillon, but at Vevey and beyond it, the whole\r\ncoast was clearly inverted; and the houses on the margin of the lake\r\nwere also imaged to a certain height. Two boats at a considerable\r\ndistance presented the appearance sketched in Figs. 3 and 4; the hull of\r\neach, except a small portion at the end, was invisible, but the sails\r\nseemed lifted up high in the air, with their inverted images below; as\r\nthe boats drew nearer the hulls appeared inverted, the apparent height\r\nof the vessel above the surface of the lake being thereby nearly\r\ndoubled, while the sails and higher objects, in these cases, were\r\nalmost completely cut away. When viewed through a telescope the sensible\r\nhorizon of the lake presented a billowy tumultuous appearance, fragments\r\nbeing incessantly detached from it and suspended in the air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MIRAGE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this effect is the same as that of the mirage of the\r\ndesert, which may be found in almost any book on physics, and which so\r\ntantalized the French soldiers in Egypt. They often mistook this aerial\r\ninversion for the reflection from a lake, and on trial found hot and\r\nsterile sand at the place where they expected refreshing waters. The\r\neffect was shown by Monge, one of the learned men who accompanied the\r\nexpedition, to be due to the total reflection of very oblique rays at\r\nthe upper surface of the layer of rarefied air which was nearest to the\r\nheated earth. A sandy plain, in the early part of the day, is peculiarly\r\nfavourable for the production of such effects; and on the extensive flat\r\nstrand which stretches between Mont St. Michel and the coast adjacent to\r\nAvranches in Normandy, I have noticed Mont Tombeline reflected as if\r\nglass instead of sand surrounded it and formed its mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHAMOUNI AND THE MONTANVERT. 1857.]\r\n\r\nCHAMOUNI AND THE MONTANVERT.\r\n\r\n(5.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 12th of July I reached Chamouni; the weather was\r\nnot quite clear, but it was promising; white cumuli had floated round\r\nMont Blanc during the day, but these diminished more and more, and the\r\nlight of the setting sun was of that lingering rosy hue which bodes good\r\nweather. Two parallel beams of a purple tinge were drawn by the shadows\r\nof the adjacent peaks, straight across the Glacier des Bossons, and the\r\nGlacier des Pelerins was also steeped for a time in the same purple\r\nlight. Once when the surrounding red illumination was strong, the\r\nshadows of the Grands Mulets falling upon the adjacent snow appeared of\r\na vivid green.\r\n\r\nThis green belonged to the class of _subjective_ colours, or colours\r\nproduced by contrast, about which a volume might be written. The eye\r\nreceived the impression of green, but the colour was not external to the\r\neye. Place a red wafer on white paper, and look at it intently, it will\r\nbe surrounded in a little time by a green fringe: move the wafer bodily\r\naway, and the entire space which it occupied upon the paper will appear\r\ngreen. A body may have its proper colour entirely masked in this way.\r\nLet a red wafer be attached to a piece of red glass, and from a\r\nmoderately illuminated position let the sky be regarded through the\r\nglass; the wafer will appear of a vivid green. If a strong beam of light\r\nbe sent through a red glass and caused to fall upon a screen, which at\r\nthe same time is moderately illuminated by a separate source of white\r\nlight, an opaque body placed in the path of the beam will cast a green\r\nshadow upon the screen which may be seen by several hundred persons at\r\nonce. If a blue glass be used, the shadow will be yellow, which is the\r\ncomplementary colour to blue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COLOURED SHADOWS. 1857.]\r\n\r\nWhen we suddenly pass from open sunlight to a moderately illuminated\r\nroom, it appears dark at first, but after a little time the eye regains\r\nthe power of seeing objects distinctly. Thus one effect of light upon\r\nthe eye is to render it less sensitive, and light of any particular\r\ncolour falling upon the eye blunts its appreciation of that colour. Let\r\nus apply this to the shadow upon the screen. This shadow is moderately\r\nilluminated by a jet of white light; but the space surrounding it is\r\nred, the effect of which upon the eye is to blind it in some degree to\r\nthe perception of red. Hence, when the feeble white light of the shadow\r\nreaches the eye, the red component of this light is, as it were,\r\nabstracted from it, and the eye sees the residual colour, which is\r\ngreen. A similar explanation applies to the shadows of the Grands\r\nMulets.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of July I was joined by my friend Mr. Thomas Hirst, and on\r\nthe 14th we examined together the end of the Mer de Glace. In former\r\ntimes the whole volume of the Arveiron escaped from beneath the ice at\r\nthe end of the glacier, forming a fine arch at its place of issue. This\r\nyear a fraction only of the water thus found egress; the greater portion\r\nof it escaping laterally from the glacier at the summit of the rocks\r\ncalled _Les Mottets_, down which it tumbled in a fine cascade. The vault\r\nat the end of the glacier was nevertheless respectable, and rather\r\ntempting to a traveller in search of information regarding the structure\r\nof the ice. Perhaps, however, Nature meant to give me a friendly warning\r\nat the outset, for, while speculating as to the wisdom of entering the\r\ncavern, it suddenly gave way, and, with a crash which rivalled thunder,\r\nthe roof strewed itself in ruins upon the floor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUNRISE AT CHAMOUNI. 1857.]\r\n\r\nMany years ago I had read with delight Coleridge's poem entitled\r\n'Sunrise in the Valley of Chamouni,' and to witness in all perfection\r\nthe scene described by the poet, I waited at Chamouni a day longer than\r\nwas otherwise necessary. On the morning of Wednesday, the 15th of July,\r\nI rose before the sun; Mont Blanc and his wondrous staff of Aiguilles\r\nwere without a cloud; eastward the sky was of a pale orange which\r\ngradually shaded off to a kind of rosy violet, and this again blended by\r\nimperceptible degrees with the deep zenithal blue. The morning star was\r\nstill shining to the right, and the moon also turned a pale face towards\r\nthe rising day. The valley was full of music; from the adjacent woods\r\nissued a gush of song, while the sound of the Arve formed a suitable\r\nbass to the shriller melody of the birds. The mountain rose for a time\r\ncold and grand, with no apparent stain upon his snows. Suddenly the\r\nsunbeams struck his crown and converted it into a boss of gold. For some\r\ntime it remained the only gilded summit in view, holding communion with\r\nthe dawn while all the others waited in silence. These, in the order of\r\ntheir heights, came afterwards, relaxing, as the sunbeams struck each in\r\nsuccession, into a blush and smile.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLACIER DES BOIS. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn the same day we had our luggage transported to the Montanvert, while\r\nwe clambered along the lateral moraine of the glacier to the Chapeau.\r\nThe rocks alongside the glacier were beautifully scratched and polished,\r\nand I paid particular attention to them, for the purpose of furnishing\r\nmyself with a key to ancient glacier action. The scene to my right was\r\none of the most wonderful I had ever witnessed. Along the entire slope\r\nof the Glacier des Bois, the ice was cleft and riven into the most\r\nstriking and fantastic forms. It had not yet suffered much from the\r\nwasting influence of the summer weather, but its towers and minarets\r\nsprang from the general mass with clean chiselled outlines. Some stood\r\nerect, others leaned, while the white debris, strewn here and there over\r\nthe glacier, showed where the wintry edifices had fallen, breaking\r\nthemselves to pieces, and grinding the masses on which they fell to\r\npowder. Some of them gave way during our inspection of the place, and\r\nshook the valley with the reverberated noise of their fall. I\r\nendeavoured to get near them, but failed; the chasms at the margin of\r\nthe glacier were too dangerous, and the stones resting upon the heights\r\ntoo loosely poised to render persistence in the attempt excusable.\r\n\r\nWe subsequently crossed the glacier to the Montanvert, and I formally\r\ntook up my position there. The rooms of the hotel were separated from\r\neach other by wooden partitions merely, and thus the noise of early\r\nrisers in one room was plainly heard in the next. For the sake of quiet,\r\ntherefore, I had my bed placed in the _chateau_ next door,--a little\r\noctagonal building erected by some kind and sentimental Frenchman, and\r\ndedicated \"_a la Nature_.\" My host at first demurred, thinking the place\r\nnot \"_propre_,\" but I insisted, and he acquiesced. True the stone floor\r\nwas dark with moisture, and on the walls a glistening was here and there\r\nobservable, which suggested rheumatism, and other penalties, but I had\r\nhad no experience of rheumatism, and trusted to the strength which\r\nmountain air and exercise were sure to give me, for power to resist its\r\nattacks. Moreover, to dispel some of the humidity, it was agreed that a\r\nlarge pine fire should be made there on necessary occasions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUARTERS AT THE MONTANVERT. 1857.]\r\n\r\nThough singularly favoured on the whole, still our residence at the\r\nMontanvert was sufficiently long to give us specimens of all kinds of\r\nweather; and thus my chateau derived an interest from the mutations of\r\nexternal nature. Sometimes no breath disturbed the perfect serenity of\r\nthe night, and the moon, set in a black-blue sky, turned a face of\r\nalmost supernatural brightness to the mountains, while in her absence\r\nthe thick-strewn stars alone flashed and twinkled through the\r\ntransparent air. Sometimes dull dank fog choked the valley, and heavy\r\nrain plashed upon the stones outside. On two or three occasions we were\r\nfavoured by a thunderstorm, every peal of which broke into a hundred\r\nechoes, while the seams of lightning which ran through the heavens\r\nproduced a wonderful intermittence of gloom and glare. And as I sat\r\nwithin, musing on the experiences of the day, with my pine logs\r\ncrackling, and the ruddy fire-light gleaming over the walls, and lending\r\nanimation to the visages sketched upon them with charcoal by the guides,\r\nI felt that my position was in every way worthy of a student of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MER DE GLACE.\r\n\r\n(6.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A RIVER OF ICE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nThe name \"Mer de Glace\" has doubtless led many who have never seen this\r\nglacier to a totally erroneous conception of its character. Misled\r\nprobably by this term, a distinguished writer, for example, defines a\r\nglacier to be a sheet of ice spread out upon the slope of a mountain;\r\nwhereas the Mer de Glace is indeed a _river_, and not a _sea_ of ice.\r\nBut certain forms upon its surface, often noticed and described, and\r\nwhich I saw for the first time from the window of our hotel on the\r\nmorning of the 16th of July, suggest at once the origin of the name. The\r\nglacier here has the appearance of a sea which, after it had been tossed\r\nby a storm, had suddenly stiffened into rest. The ridges upon its\r\nsurface accurately resemble waves in shape, and this singular appearance\r\nis produced in the following way:--\r\n\r\nSome distance above the Montanvert--opposite to the Echelets--the\r\nglacier, in passing down an incline, is rent by deep fissures, between\r\neach two of which a ridge of ice intervenes. At first the edges of these\r\nridges are sharp and angular, but they are soon sculptured off by the\r\naction of the sun. The bearing of the Mer de Glace being approximately\r\nnorth and south, the sun at mid-day shines down the glacier, or rather\r\nvery obliquely across it; and the consequence is, that the fronts of the\r\nridges, which look downward, remain in shadow all the day, while the\r\nbacks of the ridges, which look up the glacier, meet the direct stroke\r\nof the solar rays. The ridges thus acted upon have their hindmost angles\r\nwasted off and converted into slopes which represent the _back_ of a\r\nwave, while the opposite sides of the ridges, which are protected from\r\nthe sun, preserve their steepness, and represent the _front_ of the\r\nwave. Fig. 5 will render my meaning at once plain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FROZEN WAVES. 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Wave-like forms on the Mer de Glace.]\r\n\r\nThe dotted lines are intended to represent three of the ridges into\r\nwhich the glacier is divided, with their interposed fissures; the dots\r\nrepresenting the boundaries of the ridges when the glacier is first\r\nbroken. The parallel shading lines represent the direction of the sun's\r\nrays, which, falling obliquely upon the ridges, waste away the\r\nright-hand corners, and finally produce wave-like forms.\r\n\r\nWe spent a day or two in making the general acquaintance of the glacier.\r\nOn the 16th we ascended till we came to the rim of the Talefre basin,\r\nfrom which we had a good view of the glacier system of the region. The\r\nlaminated structure of the ice was a point which particularly interested\r\nme; and as I saw the exposed sections of the _neve_, counted the lines\r\nof stratification, and compared these with the lines upon the ends of\r\nthe secondary glaciers, I felt the absolute necessity either of\r\nconnecting the veined _structure_ with the _strata_ by a continuous\r\nchain of observations, or of proving by ocular evidence that they were\r\ntotally distinct from each other. I was well acquainted with the\r\nliterature of the subject, but nothing that I had read was sufficient to\r\nprove what I required. Strictly speaking, nothing that had been written\r\nupon the subject rose above the domain of _opinion_, while I felt that\r\nwithout absolute _demonstration_ the question would never be set at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Glacier Table.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLACIER TABLES. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn this day we saw some fine glacier tables; flat masses of rock, raised\r\nhigh upon columns of ice: Fig. 6 is a sketch of one of the finest of\r\nthem. Some of them fell from their pedestals while we were near them,\r\nand the clean ice-surfaces which they left behind sparkled with minute\r\nstars as the small bubbles of air ruptured the film of water by which\r\nthey were overspread. I also noticed that \"petit bruit de crepitation,\"\r\nto which M. Agassiz alludes, and which he refers to the rupture of the\r\nice by the expansion of the air-bubbles contained within it. When I\r\nfirst read Agassiz's account of it, I thought it might be produced by\r\nthe rupture of the minute air-bubbles which incessantly escape from the\r\nglacier. This, doubtless, produces an effect, but there is something in\r\nthe character of the sound to be referred, I think, to a less obvious\r\ncause, which I shall notice further on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIRST SIGHT OF THE DIRT-BANDS. 1857.]\r\n\r\nAt six P.M. this day I reached the Montanvert; and the same evening,\r\nwrapping my plaid around me, I wandered up towards Charmoz, and from its\r\nheights observed, as they had been observed fifteen years previously by\r\nProfessor Forbes, the _dirt-bands_ of the Mer de Glace. They were\r\ndifferent from any I had previously seen, and I felt a strong desire to\r\ntrace them to their origin. Content, however, with the performance of\r\nthe day, and feeling healthily tired by it, I lay down upon the bilberry\r\nbushes and fell asleep. It was dark when I awoke, and I experienced some\r\ndifficulty and risk in getting down from the petty eminence referred to.\r\n\r\nThe illumination of the glacier, as remarked by Professor Forbes, has\r\ngreat influence upon the appearance of the bands; they are best seen in\r\na subdued light, and I think for the following reasons:--\r\n\r\nThe dirt-bands are seen simply because they send less light to the eye\r\nthan the cleaner portions of the glacier which lie between them; two\r\nsurfaces, differently illuminated, are presented to the eye, and it is\r\nfound that this difference is more observable when the light is that of\r\nevening than when it is that of noon.\r\n\r\nIt is only within certain limits that the eye is able to perceive\r\ndifferences of intensity in different lights; beyond a certain\r\nintensity, if I may use the expression, light ceases to be light, and\r\nbecomes mere pain. The naked eye can detect no difference in brightness\r\nbetween the electric light and the lime light, although, when we come\r\nto strict measurement, the former may possess many times the intensity\r\nof the latter. It follows from this that we might reduce the ordinary\r\nelectric light to a fraction of its intensity, without any perceptible\r\nchange of brightness to the naked eye which looks at it. But if we\r\nreduce the lime light in the same proportion the effect would be very\r\ndifferent. This light lies much nearer to the limit at which the eye can\r\nappreciate differences of brightness, and its reduction might bring it\r\nquite within this limit, and make it sensibly dimmer than before. Hence\r\nwe see that when two sources of intense light are presented to the eye,\r\nby reducing both the lights in the same proportion, the _difference_\r\nbetween them may become more perceptible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BANDS SEEN BEST BY TWILIGHT. 1857.]\r\n\r\nNow the dirt-bands and the spaces between them resemble, in some\r\nmeasure, the two lights above mentioned. By the full glare of noon both\r\nare so strongly illuminated that the difference which the eye perceives\r\nis very small; as the evening advances the light of both is lowered in\r\nthe same proportion, but the differential effect upon the eye is thereby\r\naugmented, and the bands are consequently more clearly seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(7.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 17th of July, we commenced our measurements. Through the\r\nkindness of Sir Roderick Murchison, I found myself in the possession of\r\nan excellent five-inch theodolite, an instrument with the use of which\r\nboth my friend Hirst and myself were perfectly familiar. We worked in\r\nconcert for a few days to familiarize our assistant with the mode of\r\nproceeding, but afterwards it was my custom to simply determine the\r\nposition where a measurement was to be made, and to leave the execution\r\nof it entirely to Mr. Hirst and our guide.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of July I made a long excursion up the glacier, examining\r\nthe moraines, the crevasses, the structure, the moulins, and the\r\ndisintegration of the surface. I was accompanied by a boy named Edouard\r\nBalmat,[A] and found him so good an iceman that I was induced to take\r\nhim with me on the following day also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CLEFT STATION. 1857.]\r\n\r\nLooking upwards from the Montanvert to the left of the Aiguille de\r\nCharmoz, a singular gap is observed in the rocky mountain wall, in the\r\ncentre of which stands a detached column of granite. Both cleft and\r\npillar are shown in the frontispiece, to the right. The eminence to the\r\nleft of this gap is signalised by Professor Forbes as one of the best\r\nstations from which to view the Mer de Glace, and this point, which I\r\nshall refer to hereafter as the _Cleft Station_, it was now my desire to\r\nattain. From the Montanvert side a steep gully leads to the cleft; up\r\nthis couloir we proposed to try the ascent. At a considerable height\r\nabove the Mer de Glace, and closely hugging the base of the Aiguille de\r\nCharmoz, is the small Glacier de Tendue, shown in the frontispiece, and\r\nfrom which a steep slope stretches down to the Mer de Glace. This Tendue\r\nis the most _talkative_ glacier I have ever known; the clatter of the\r\nsmall stones which fall from it is incessant. Huge masses of granite\r\nalso frequently fall upon the glacier from the cliffs above it, and,\r\nbeing slowly borne downwards by the moving ice, are at length seen\r\ntoppling above the terminal face of the glacier. The ice which supports\r\nthem being gradually melted, they are at length undermined, and sent\r\nbounding down the slope with peal and rattle, according as the masses\r\namong which they move are large or small. The space beneath the glacier\r\nis cumbered with blocks thus sent down; some of them of enormous size.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROUGH ASCENT. 1857.]\r\n\r\nThe danger arising from this intermittent cannonade, though in reality\r\nsmall, has caused the guides to swerve from the path which formerly led\r\nacross the slope to the promontory of Trelaporte. I say \"small,\"\r\nbecause, even should a rock choose the precise moment at which a\r\ntraveller is passing to leap down, the boulders at hand are so large and\r\nso capable of bearing a shock that the least presence of mind would be\r\nsufficient to place him in safety. But presence of mind is not to be\r\ncalculated on under such circumstances, and hence the guides were right\r\nto abandon the path.\r\n\r\nReaching the mouth of our gully after a rough ascent, we took to the\r\nsnow, instead of climbing the adjacent rocks. It was moist and soft, in\r\nfact in a condition altogether favourable for the \"regelation\" of its\r\ngranules. As the foot pressed upon it the particles became cemented\r\ntogether. A portion of the pressure was transmitted laterally, which\r\nproduced attachments beyond the boundary of the foot; thus as the latter\r\nsank, it pressed upon a surface which became continually wider and more\r\nrigid, and at length sufficiently strong to bear the entire weight of\r\nthe body; the pressed snow formed in fact a virtual _camel's foot_,\r\nwhich soon placed a limit to the sinking. It is this same principle of\r\nregelation which enables men to cross snow bridges in safety. By gentle\r\ncautious pressure the loose granules of the substance are cemented into\r\na continuous mass, all sudden shocks which might cause the frozen\r\nsurfaces to snap asunder being avoided. In this way an arch of snow\r\nfifteen or twenty inches in thickness may be rendered so firm that a\r\nman will cross it, although it may span a chasm one hundred feet in\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nAs we ascended, the incline became very steep, and once or twice we\r\ndiverged from the snow to the adjacent rocks; these were disintegrated,\r\nand the slightest disturbance was sufficient to bring them down; some\r\nfell, and from one of them I found it a little difficult to escape; for\r\nit grazed my leg, inflicting a slight wound as it passed. Just before\r\nreaching the cleft at which we aimed, the snow for a short distance was\r\nexceedingly steep, but we surmounted it; and I sat for a time beside the\r\ngranite pillar, pleased to find that I could permit my legs to dangle\r\nover a precipice without prejudice to my head.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHAMOIS ON THE MOUNTAINS. 1857.]\r\n\r\nWhile we remained here a chamois made its appearance upon the rocks\r\nabove us. Deeming itself too near, it climbed higher, and then turned\r\nround to watch us. It was soon joined by a second, and the two formed a\r\nvery pretty picture: their attitudes frequently changed, but they were\r\nalways graceful; with head erect and horns curved back, a light limb\r\nthrown forward upon a ledge of rock, looking towards us with wild and\r\nearnest gaze, each seemed a type of freedom and agility. Turning now to\r\nthe left, we attacked the granite tower, from which we purposed to scan\r\nthe glacier, and were soon upon its top. My companion was greatly\r\npleased--he was \"tres-content\" to have reached the place--he felt\r\nassured that many old guides would have retreated from that ugly gully,\r\nwith its shifting shingle and debris, and his elation reached its climax\r\nin the declaration that, if I resolved to ascend Mont Blanc without a\r\nguide, he was willing to accompany me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCENE FROM THE STATION. 1857.]\r\n\r\nFrom the position which we had attained, the prospect was exceedingly\r\nfine, both of the glaciers and of the mountains. Beside us was the\r\nAiguille de Charmoz, piercing with its spikes of granite the clear air.\r\nTo my mind it is one of the finest of the Aiguilles, noble in mass, with\r\nits summits singularly cleft and splintered. In some atmospheric\r\ncolourings it has the exact appearance of a mountain of cast copper, and\r\nthe manner in which some of its highest pinnacles are bent, suggesting\r\nthe idea of ductility, gives strength to the illusion that the mass is\r\nmetallic. At the opposite side of the glacier was the Aiguille Verte,\r\nwith a cloud poised upon its point: it has long been the ambition of\r\nclimbers to scale this peak, and on this day it was attempted by a young\r\nFrench count with a long retinue of guides. He had not fair play, for\r\nbefore we quitted our position we heard the rumble of thunder upon the\r\nmountain, which indicated the presence of a foe more terrible than the\r\navalanches themselves. Higher to the right, and also at the opposite\r\nside of the glacier, rose the Aiguille du Moine; and beyond was the\r\nbasin of the Talefre, the ice cascade issuing from which appeared, from\r\nour position, like the foam of a waterfall. Then came the Aiguille de\r\nLechaud, the Petite Jorasse, the Grande Jorasse, and the Mont Tacul; all\r\nof which form a cradle for the Glacier de Lechaud. Mont Mallet, the\r\nPeriades, and the Aiguille Noire, came next, and then the singular\r\nobelisk of the Aiguille du Geant, from which a serrated edge of cliff\r\ndescends to the summit of the \"Col.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SERACS OF THE COL DU GEANT. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOver the slopes of the Col du Geant was spread a coverlet of shining\r\nsnow, at some places apparently as smooth as polished marble, at others\r\nbroken so as to form precipices, on the pale blue faces of which the\r\nhorizontal lines of bedding were beautifully drawn. As the eye\r\napproaches the line which stretches from the Rognon to the Aiguille\r\nNoire, the repose of the _neve_ becomes more and more disturbed. Vast\r\nchasms are formed, which however are still merely indicative of the\r\ntrouble in advance. If the glacier were lifted off we should probably\r\nsee that the line just referred to would lie along the summit of a\r\nsteep gorge; over this summit the glacier is pushed, and has its back\r\nperiodically broken, thus forming vast transverse ridges which follow\r\neach other in succession down the slope. At the summit these ridges are\r\noften cleft by fissures transverse to them, thus forming detached towers\r\nof ice of the most picturesque and imposing character.[B] These towers\r\noften fall; and while some are caught upon the platforms of the cascade,\r\nothers struggle with the slow energy of a behemoth through the debris\r\nwhich opposes them, reach the edges of the precipices which rise in\r\nsuccession along the fall, leap over, and, amid ice-smoke and\r\nthunder-peals, fight their way downwards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLACIER MOTION. 1857.]\r\n\r\nA great number of secondary glaciers were in sight hanging on the steep\r\nslopes of the mountains, and from them streams sped downwards, falling\r\nover the rocks, and filling the valley with a low rich music. In front\r\nof me, for example, was the Glacier du Moine, and I could not help\r\nfeeling as I looked at it, that the arguments drawn from the deportment\r\nof such glaciers against the \"sliding theory,\" and which are still\r\nrepeated in works upon the Alps, militate just as strongly against the\r\n\"viscous theory.\" \"How,\" demands the antagonist of the sliding theory,\r\n\"can a secondary glacier exist upon so steep a slope? why does it not\r\nslide down as an avalanche?\" \"But how,\" the person addressed may retort,\r\n\"can a mass which you assume to be viscous exist under similar\r\nconditions? If it be viscous, what prevents it from rolling down?\" The\r\nsliding theory assumes the lubrication of the bed of the glacier, but on\r\nthis cold height the quantity melted is too small to lubricate the bed,\r\nand hence the slow motion of these glaciers. Thus a sliding-theory man\r\nmight reason, and, if the external deportment of secondary glaciers were\r\nto decide the question, De Saussure might perhaps have the best of the\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nAnd with regard to the current idea, originated by M. de Charpentier,\r\nand adopted by Professor Forbes, that if a glacier slides it must slide\r\nas an avalanche, it may be simply retorted that, in part, _it does so_;\r\nbut if it be asserted that an _accelerated motion_ is the necessary\r\nmotion of an avalanche, the statement needs qualification. An avalanche\r\non passing through a rough couloir soon attains a uniform velocity--its\r\nmotion being accelerated only up to the point when the sum of the\r\nresistances acting upon it is equal to the force drawing it downwards.\r\nThese resistances are furnished by the numberless asperities which the\r\nmass encounters, and which incessantly check its descent, and render an\r\naccumulation of motion impossible. The motion of a man walking down\r\nstairs may be on the whole uniform, but it is really made up of an\r\naggregate of small motions, each of which is accelerated; and it is easy\r\nto conceive how a glacier moving over an uneven bed, when released from\r\none opposing obstacle will be checked by another, and its motion thus\r\nrendered sensibly uniform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORAINES. 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRIBUTARIES OF THE MER DE GLACE. 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Tributaries of the Mer de Glace.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Aiguille du Geant and Les Periades a glacier descended, which\r\nwas separated by the promontory of La Noire from the glacier proceeding\r\nfrom the Col du Geant. A small moraine was formed between them, which is\r\nmarked _a_ upon the diagram, Fig. 7. The great mass of the glacier\r\ndescending from the Col du Geant came next, and this was bounded on the\r\nside nearest to Trelaporte by a small moraine _b_, the origin of which I\r\ncould not see, its upper portion being shut out by a mountain\r\npromontory. Between the moraine _b_ and the actual side of the valley\r\nwas another little glacier, derived from some of the lateral\r\ntributaries. It was, however, between the moraines _a_ and _b_ that the\r\ngreat mass of the Glacier du Geant really lay. At the promontory of the\r\nTacul the lateral moraines of the Glacier des Periades and of the\r\nGlacier de Lechaud united to form the medial moraine _c_ of the Mer de\r\nGlace. Carrying the eye across the Lechaud, we had the moraine _d_\r\nformed by the union of the lateral moraines of the Lechaud and Talefre;\r\nfurther to the left was the moraine _e_, which came from the Jardin, and\r\nbeyond it was the second lateral moraine of the Talefre. The Mer de\r\nGlace is formed by the confluence of the whole of the glaciers here\r\nnamed; being forced at Trelaporte through a passage, the width of which\r\nappears considerably less than that of the single tributary, the Glacier\r\ndu Geant.\r\n\r\nIn the ice near Trelaporte the blue veins of the glacier are beautifully\r\nshown; but they vary in distinctness according to the manner in which\r\nthey are looked at. When regarded obliquely their colour is not so\r\npronounced as when the vision plunges deeply into them. The weathered\r\nice of the surface near Trelaporte could be cloven with great facility;\r\nI could with ease obtain plates of it a quarter of an inch thick, and\r\npossessing two square feet of surface. On the 28th of July I followed\r\nthe veins several times from side to side across the Geant portion of\r\nthe Mer de Glace; starting from one side, and walking along the veins,\r\nmy route was directed obliquely downwards towards the axis of the\r\ntributary. At the axis I was forced to turn, in order to keep along the\r\nveins, and now ascended along a line which formed nearly the same angle\r\nwith the axis at the other side. Thus the veins led me as it were along\r\nthe two sides of a triangle, the vertex of which was near the centre of\r\nthe glacier. The vertex was, however, in reality rounded off, and the\r\nfigure rather resembled a hyperbola, which tended to coincidence with\r\nits asymptotes. This observation corroborates those of Professor Forbes\r\nwith regard to the position of the veins, and, like him, I found that at\r\nthe centre the veining, whose normal direction would be transverse to\r\nthe glacier, was contorted and confused.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WASTING OF ICE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nNear the side of the Glacier du Geant, above the promontory of\r\nTrelaporte, the ice is rent in a remarkable manner. Looking upwards from\r\nthe lower portions of the glacier, a series of vertical walls, rising\r\napparently one above the other, face the observer. I clambered up among\r\nthese singular terraces, and now recognise, both from my sketch and\r\nmemory, that their peculiar forms are due to the same action as that\r\nwhich has given their shape to the \"billows\" of the Mer de Glace. A\r\nseries of profound crevasses is first formed. The Glacier du Geant\r\ndeviates 14 deg. from the meridian line, and hence the sun shines nearly\r\ndown it during the middle portion of each day. The backs of the ridges\r\nbetween the crevasses are thus rounded off, one boundary of each fissure\r\nis destroyed, or at least becomes a mere steep declivity, while the\r\nother boundary being shaded from the sun preserves its verticality; and\r\nthus a very curious series of precipices is formed.\r\n\r\nThrough all this dislocation, the little moraine on which I have placed\r\nthe letter _b_ in the sketch maintains its right to existence, and under\r\nit the laminated structure of this portion of the glacier appears to\r\nreach its most perfect development. The moraine was generally a mere\r\ndirt track, but one or two immense blocks of granite were perched upon\r\nit. I examined the ice underneath one of these, being desirous of seeing\r\nwhether the pressure resulting from its enormous weight would produce a\r\nveining, but the result was not satisfactory. Veins were certainly to be\r\nseen in directions different from the normal ones, but whether they were\r\ndue to the bending of the latter, or were directly owing to the pressure\r\nof the block, I could not say. The sides of a stream which had cut a\r\ndeep gorge in the clean ice of the Glacier du Geant afforded a fine\r\nopportunity of observing the structure. It was very remarkable--highly\r\nsignificant indeed in a theoretic point of view. Two long and\r\nremarkably deep blue veins traversed the bottom of the stream, and\r\nbending upwards at a place where the rivulet curved, drew themselves\r\nlike a pair of parallel lines upon the clean white ice. But the general\r\nstructure was of a totally different character; it did not consist of\r\nlong bars, but approximated to the lenticular form, and was, moreover,\r\nof a washy paleness, which scarcely exceeded in depth of colouring the\r\nwhitish ice around.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GROOVES ON THE SURFACE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nTo the investigator of the structure nothing can be finer than the\r\nappearance of the glacier from one of the ice terraces cut in the\r\nGlacier du Geant by its passage round Trelaporte. As far as the vision\r\nextended the dirt upon the surface of the ice was arranged in striae.\r\nThese striae were not always straight lines, nor were they unbroken\r\ncurves. Within slight limits the various parts into which a glacier is\r\ncut up by its crevasses enjoy a kind of independent motion. The grooves,\r\nfor example, on two ridges which have been separated by a small fissure,\r\nmay one day have their striae perfect continuations of each other, but in\r\na short time this identity of direction may be destroyed by a difference\r\nof motion between the ridges. Thus it is that the grooves upon the\r\nsurface above Trelaporte are bent hither and thither, a crack or seam\r\nalways marking the point where their continuity is ruptured. This\r\nbending occurs, however, within limits sufficiently small to enable the\r\nstriae to preserve the same general direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SEAMS OF WHITE ICE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nMy attention had often been attracted this day by projecting masses of\r\nwhat at first appeared to be pure white snow, rising in seams above the\r\ngeneral surface of the glacier. On examination, however, I found them to\r\nbe compact ice, filled with innumerable air-cells, and so resistant as\r\nto maintain itself in some places at a height of four feet above the\r\ngeneral level. When amongst the ridges they appeared discontinuous and\r\nconfused, being scattered apparently at random over the glacier; but\r\nwhen viewed from a sufficient distance, the detached parts showed\r\nthemselves to belong to a system of white seams which swept quite across\r\nthe Glacier du Geant, in a direction concentric with the structure.\r\nUnable to account for these singular seams, I climbed up among the\r\ntributary glaciers on the Rognon side of the Glacier du Geant, and\r\nremained there until the sun sank behind the neighbouring peaks, and the\r\nfading light warned me that it was time to return.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"Le petit Balmat\" my host always called him.\r\n\r\n[B] To such towers the name _Seracs_ is applied. In the chalets of\r\nSavoy, after the richer curd has been precipitated by rennet, a stronger\r\nacid is used to throw down what remains; an inferior kind of cheese\r\ncalled _Serac_ is thus formed, the shape and colour of which have\r\nsuggested the application of the term to the cubical masses of ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(8.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on the following day I was again upon the ice. I first confined\r\nmyself to the right side of the Glacier du Geant, and found that the\r\nveins of white ice which I had noticed on the previous day were\r\nexclusively confined to this glacier, or to the space between the\r\nmoraines _a_ and _b_ (Fig. 7), bending up so that the moraine _a_\r\nbetween the Glacier du Geant and the Glacier des Periades was tangent to\r\nthem. At a good distance up the glacier I encountered a considerable\r\nstream rushing across it almost from side to side. I followed the\r\nrivulet, examining the sections which it exposed. At a certain point\r\nthree other streams united, and formed at their place of confluence a\r\nsmall green lake. From this a rivulet rushed, which was joined by the\r\nstream whose track I had pursued, and at this place of junction a second\r\ngreen lake was formed, from which flowed a stream equal in volume to the\r\nsum of all the tributaries. It entered a crevasse, and took the bottom\r\nof the fissure for its bed. Standing at the entrance of the chasm, a low\r\nmuffled thunder resounding through the valley attracted my attention. I\r\nfollowed the crevasse, which deepened and narrowed, and, by the blue\r\nlight of the ice, could see the stream gambolling along its bottom, and\r\nflashing as it jumped over the ledges which it encountered in its way.\r\nThe fissure at length came to an end: placing a foot on each side of it,\r\nand withholding the stronger light from my eyes, I looked down between\r\nits shining walls, and saw the stream plunge into a shaft which carried\r\nit to the bottom of the glacier.\r\n\r\nSlowly, and in zigzag fashion, as the crevasses demanded, I continued to\r\nascend, sometimes climbing vast humps of ice from which good views of\r\nthe surrounding glacier were obtained; sometimes hidden in the hollows\r\nbetween the humps, in which also green glacier tarns were often formed,\r\nvery lonely and very beautiful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A LAKE SET FREE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nWhile standing beside one of these, and watching the moving clouds which\r\nit faithfully mirrored, I heard the sound of what appeared to be a\r\ndescending avalanche, but the time of its continuance surprised me.\r\nLooking through my opera-glass in the direction of the sound, I saw\r\nissuing from the end of a secondary glacier on the Tacul side a torrent\r\nof what appeared to me to be stones and mud. I could see the stones and\r\nfiner debris jumping down the declivities, and shaping themselves into\r\nsingular cascades. The noise continued for a quarter of an hour, after\r\nwhich the torrent rapidly diminished, until, at length, the ordinary\r\nlittle stream due to the melting of the glacier alone remained. A\r\nsubglacial lake had burst its boundary, and carried along with it in its\r\nrush downwards the debris which it met with in its course.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IMPRESSIVE SCENE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nIn some places I found the crevasses difficult, the ice being split in a\r\nvery singular manner. Vast plates of it not more than a foot in\r\nthickness were sometimes detached from the sides of the crevasses, and\r\nstood alone. I was now approaching the base of the _seracs_, and the\r\nglacier around me still retained a portion of the turbulence of the\r\ncascade. I halted at times amid the ruin and confusion, and examined\r\nwith my glass the cascade itself. It was a wild and wonderful scene,\r\nsuggesting throes of spasmodic energy, though, in reality, all its\r\ndislocation had been _slowly_ and _gradually_ produced. True, the\r\nstratified blocks which here and there cumbered the terraces suggested\r\n_debacles_, but these were local and partial, and did not affect\r\nthe general question. There is scarcely a case of geological\r\ndisturbance which could not be matched with its analogue upon the\r\nglaciers,--contortions, faults, fissures, joints, and dislocations,--but\r\nin the case of the ice we can prove the effects to be due to\r\nslowly-acting causes; how reasonable is it then to ascribe to the\r\noperation of similar causes, which have had an incomparably longer time\r\nto work, many geological effects which at first sight might suggest\r\nsudden convulsion!\r\n\r\nWandering slowly upwards, successive points of attraction drawing me\r\nalmost unconsciously on, I found myself as the day was declining deep in\r\nthe entanglements of the ice. A shower commenced, and a splendid rainbow\r\nthrew an oblique arch across the glacier. I was quite alone; the scene\r\nwas exceedingly impressive, and the possibility of difficulties on which\r\nI had not calculated intervening between me and the lower glacier, gave\r\na tinge of anxiety to my position. I turned towards home; crossed some\r\nbosses of ice and rounded others; I followed the tracks of streams which\r\nwere very irregular on this portion of the glacier, bending hither and\r\nthither, rushing through deep-cut channels, falling in cascades and\r\nexpanding here and there to deep green lakes; they often plunged into\r\nthe depths of the ice, flowed under it with hollow gurgle, and\r\nreappeared at some distant point. I threaded my way cautiously amid\r\nsystems of crevasses, scattering with my axe, to secure a footing, the\r\nrotten ice of the sharper crests, which fell with a ringing sound into\r\nthe chasms at either side. Strange subglacial noises were sometimes\r\nheard, as if caverns existed underneath, into which blocks of ice fell\r\nat intervals, transmitting the shock of their fall with a dull boom to\r\nthe surface of the glacier. By the steady surmounting of difficulties\r\none after another, I at length placed them all behind me, and afterwards\r\nhastened swiftly along the glacier to my mountain home.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHAMOUNI RULES. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th incessant rain confined us to indoor work; on the 31st we\r\ndetermined the velocity with which the glacier is forced through the\r\nentrance of the trunk valley at Trelaporte, and also the motion of the\r\nGrand Moulin. We also determined both the velocity and the width of the\r\nGlacier du Geant. The 1st of August was spent by me at the cascade of\r\nthe Talefre, examining the structure, crumpling, and scaling off of the\r\nice. Finding that the rules at Chamouni put an unpleasant limit to my\r\ndemands on my guide Simond, I visited the Guide Chef on the 2nd of\r\nAugust, and explained to him the object of my expedition, pointing out\r\nthe inconvenience which a rigid application of the rules made for\r\ntourists would impose upon me. He had then the good sense to acknowledge\r\nthe reasonableness of my remarks, and to grant me the liberty I\r\nrequested. The 3rd of August was employed in determining the velocity\r\nand width of the Glacier de Lechaud, and in observations on the\r\nlamination of the glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE JARDIN. 1857.]\r\n\r\nTHE JARDIN.\r\n\r\n(9.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A RESERVOIR OF ICE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of August, with a view of commencing a series of observations\r\non the inclinations of the Mer de Glace and its tributaries, we had our\r\ntheodolite transported to the _Jardin_, which, as is well known, lies\r\nlike an island in the middle of the Glacier du Talefre. We reached the\r\nplace by the usual route, and found some tourists reposing on the soft\r\ngreen sward which covers the lower portion, and to which, and the\r\nflowers which spangle it, the place owes its name. Towards the summit of\r\nthe Jardin, a rock jutted forward, apparently the very apex of the\r\nplace, or at least hiding by its prominence everything that might exist\r\nbehind it; leaving our guide with the instrument, we aimed at this, and\r\nsoon left the grass and flowers behind us. Stepping amid broken\r\nfragments of rock, along slopes of granite, with fat felspar crystals\r\nwhich gave the boots a hold, and crossing at intervals patches of snow,\r\nwhich continued still to challenge the summer heat, I at length found\r\nmyself upon the peak referred to; and, although it was not the highest,\r\nthe unimpeded view which it commanded induced me to get astride it. The\r\nJardin was completely encircled by the ice of the glacier, and this was\r\nheld in a mountain basin, which was bounded all round by a grand and\r\ncliffy rim. The outline of the dark brown crags--a deeply serrated and\r\nirregular line--was forcibly drawn against the blue heaven, and still\r\nmore strongly against some white and fleecy clouds which lay here and\r\nthere behind it; while detached spears and pillars of rock, sculptured\r\nby frost and lightning, stood like a kind of defaced statuary along the\r\nridge. All round the basin the snow reared itself like a buttress\r\nagainst the precipitous cliffs, being streaked and fluted by the descent\r\nof blocks from the summits. This mighty tub is the collector of one of\r\nthe tributaries of the Mer de Glace. According to Professor Forbes, its\r\ngreatest diameter is 4200 yards, and out of it the half-formed ice is\r\nsqueezed through a precipitous gorge about 700 yards wide, forming there\r\nthe ice cascade of the Talefre. Bounded on one side by the Grande\r\nJorasse, and on the other by Mont Mallet, the principal tributary of the\r\nGlacier de Lechaud lay white and pure upon the mountain slope. Round\r\nfurther to the right we had the vast plateau whence the Glacier du Geant\r\nis fed, fenced on the left by the Aiguille du Geant and the Aiguille\r\nNoire, and on the right by the Monts Maudits and Mont Blanc. The scene\r\nwas a truly majestic one. The mighty Aiguilles piercing the sea of air,\r\nthe soft white clouds floating here and there behind them; the shining\r\nsnow with its striped faults and precipices; the deep blue firmament\r\noverhead; the peals of avalanches and the sound of water;--all conspired\r\nto render the scene glorious, and our enjoyment of it deep.\r\n\r\nA voice from above hailed me as I moved from my perch; it was my friend,\r\nwho had found a lodgment upon the edge of a rock which was quite\r\ndetached from the Jardin, being the first to lift its head in opposition\r\nto the descending _neve_. Making a detour round a steep concave slope of\r\nthe glacier, I reached the flat summit of the rock. The end of a ridge\r\nof ice abutted against it, which was split and bent by the pressure so\r\nas to form a kind of arch. I cut steps in the ice, and ascended until I\r\ngot beneath the azure roof. Innumerable little rills of pellucid water\r\ndescended from it. Some came straight down, clear for a time, and\r\napparently motionless, rapidly tapering at first, and more slowly\r\nafterwards, until, at the point of maximum contraction, they resolved\r\nthemselves into strings of liquid pearls which pattered against the ice\r\nfloor underneath. Others again, owing to the directions of the little\r\nstreamlets of which they were constituted, formed spiral figures of\r\ngreat beauty: one liquid vein wound itself round another, forming a\r\nspiral protuberance, and owing to the centrifugal motion thus imparted,\r\nthe vein, at its place of rupture, scattered itself laterally in little\r\nliquid spherules.[A] Even at this great elevation the structure of the\r\nice was fairly developed, not with the sharpness to be observed lower\r\ndown, but still perfectly decided. Blue bands crossed the ridge of ice\r\nto which I have referred, at right angles to the direction of the\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORAINES OF THE TALEFRE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nI descended, and found my friend beneath an overhanging rock.\r\nImmediately afterwards a peal like that of thunder shook the air, and\r\nright in front of us an avalanche darted down the brown cliffs, then\r\nalong a steep slope of snow which reared itself against the mountain\r\nwall, carrying with it the debris of the rocks over which it passed,\r\nuntil it finally lay a mass of sullied rubbish at the base of the\r\nincline: the whole surface of the Talefre is thus soiled. Another peal\r\nwas heard immediately afterwards, but the avalanche which caused it was\r\nhidden from us by a rocky promontory. From this same promontory the\r\ngreater portion of the medial moraine which descends the cascade of the\r\nTalefre is derived, forming at first a gracefully winding curve, and\r\nafterwards stretching straight to the summit of the fall. In the chasms\r\nof the cascade its boulders are engulfed, but the lost moraine is\r\nrestored below the fall, as if disgorged by the ice which had swallowed\r\nit. From the extremity of the Jardin itself a mere driblet of a moraine\r\nproceeds, running parallel to the former, and like it disappearing at\r\nthe summit of the cascade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMONG THE CREVASSES. 1857.]\r\n\r\nWe afterwards descended towards the cascade, but long before this is\r\nattained the most experienced iceman would find himself in difficulty.\r\nTransverse crevasses are formed, which follow each other so speedily as\r\nto leave between them mere narrow ridges of ice, along which we moved\r\ncautiously, jumping the adjacent fissures, or getting round them, as the\r\ncase demanded. As we approached the jaws of the gorge, the ridges\r\ndwindled to mere plates and wedges, which being bent and broken by the\r\nlateral pressure, added to the confusion, and warned us not to advance.\r\nThe position was in some measure an exciting one. Our guide had never\r\nbeen here before; we were far from the beaten track, and the riven\r\nglacier wore an aspect of treacherous hostility. As at the base of the\r\n_seracs_, a subterranean noise sometimes announced the falling of\r\nice-blocks into hollows underneath, the existence of which the resonant\r\nconcussion of the fallen mass alone revealed. There was thus a dash of\r\nawe mingled with our thoughts; a stirring up of the feelings which\r\ntroubled the coolness of the intellect. We finally swerved to the right,\r\nand by a process the reverse of straightforward reached the Couvercle.\r\nNightfall found us at the threshold of our hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The recent hydraulic researches of Professor Magnus furnish some\r\nbeautiful illustrations of this action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(10.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROUND HAILSTONES. 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DANGEROUS LEAP. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th we were engaged for some time in an important measurement at\r\nthe Tacul. We afterwards ascended towards the _seracs_, and determined\r\nthe inclinations of the Glacier du Geant downwards. Dense cloud-masses\r\ngathered round the points of the Aiguilles, and the thunder bellowed at\r\nintervals from the summit of Mont Blanc. As we descended the Mer de\r\nGlace the valley in front of us was filled with a cloud of pitchy\r\ndarkness. Suddenly from side to side this field of gloom was riven by a\r\nbar of lightning of intolerable splendour; it was followed by a peal of\r\ncommensurate grandeur, the echoes of which leaped from cliff to cliff\r\nlong after the first sound had died away. The discharge seemed to unlock\r\nthe clouds above us, for they showered their liquid spheres down upon us\r\nwith a momentum like that of swan-shot: all the way home we were\r\nbattered by this pellet-like rain. On the 6th the rain continued with\r\nscarcely any pause; on the 7th I was engaged all day upon the Glacier du\r\nGeant; on the morning of the 8th heavy hail had fallen there, the stones\r\nbeing perfect spheres; the rounded rain-drops had solidified during\r\ntheir descent without sensible change of form. When this hail was\r\nsqueezed together, it exactly resembled a mass of oolitic limestone\r\nwhich I had picked up in 1853 near Blankenburg in the Hartz. Mr. Hirst\r\nand myself were engaged together this day taking the inclinations: he\r\nstruck his theodolite at the Angle, and went home accompanied by Simond,\r\nand the evening being extremely serene, I pursued my way down the centre\r\nof the glacier towards the Echelets. The crevasses as I advanced became\r\nmore deep and frequent, the ridges of ice between them becoming\r\ngradually narrower. They were very fine, their downward faces being\r\nclear cut, perfectly vertical, and in many cases beautifully veined.\r\nVast plates of ice moreover often stood out midway between the walls of\r\nthe chasms, as if cloven from the glacier and afterwards set on edge.\r\nThe place was certainly one calculated to test the skill and nerve of an\r\niceman; and as the day drooped, and the shadow in the valley deepened, a\r\nfeeling approaching to awe took possession of me. My route was an\r\nexaggerated zigzag; right and left amid the chasms wherever a hope of\r\nprogress opened; and here I made the experience which I have often\r\nrepeated since, and laid to heart as regards intellectual work also,\r\nthat enormous difficulties may be overcome when they are attacked in\r\nearnest. Sometimes I found myself so hedged in by fissures that escape\r\nseemed absolutely impossible; but close and resolute examination so\r\noften revealed a means of exit, that I felt in all its force the brave\r\nverity of the remark of Mirabeau, that the word \"impossible\" is a mere\r\nblockhead of a word. It finally became necessary to reach the shore, but\r\nI found this a work of extreme difficulty. At length, however, it became\r\npretty evident that, if I could cross a certain crevasse, my retreat\r\nwould be secured. The width of the fissure seemed to be fairly within\r\njumping distance, and if I could have calculated on a safe purchase for\r\nmy foot I should have thought little of the spring; but the ice on the\r\nedge from which I was to leap was loose and insecure, and hence a kind\r\nof nervous thrill shot through me as I made the bound. The opposite side\r\nwas fairly reached, but an involuntary tremor shook me all over after I\r\nfelt myself secure. I reached the edge of the glacier without further\r\nserious difficulty, and soon after found myself steeped in the creature\r\ncomforts of our hotel.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, August 10th, I had the great pleasure of being joined by my\r\nfriend Huxley; and though the weather was very unpromising, we started\r\ntogether up the glacier, he being desirous to learn something of its\r\ngeneral features, and, if possible, to reach the Jardin. We reached the\r\nCouvercle, and squeezed ourselves through the Egralets; but here the\r\nrain whizzed past us, and dense fog settled upon the cascade of the\r\nTalefre, obscuring all its parts. We met Mr. Galton, the African\r\ntraveller, returning from an attempt upon the Jardin; and learning that\r\nhis guides had lost their way in the fog, we deemed it prudent to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing brief notes will have informed the reader that at the\r\nperiod of Mr. Huxley's arrival I was not without due training upon the\r\nice; I may also remark, that on the 25th of July I reached the summit\r\nof the Col du Geant, accompanied by the boy Balmat, and returned to the\r\nMontanvert on the same day. My health was perfect, and incessant\r\npractice had taught me the art of dealing with the difficulties of the\r\nice. From the time of my arrival at the Montanvert the thought of\r\nascending Mont Blanc, and thus expanding my knowledge of the glaciers,\r\nhad often occurred to me, and I think I was justified in feeling that\r\nthe discipline which both my friend Hirst and myself had undergone ought\r\nto enable us to accomplish the journey in a much more modest way than\r\nordinary. I thought a single guide sufficient for this purpose, and I\r\nwas strengthened in this opinion by the fact that Simond, who was a man\r\nof the strictest prudence, and who at first declared four guides to be\r\nnecessary, had lowered his demand first to two, and was now evidently\r\nwilling to try the ascent with us alone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PREPARATIONS FOR A CLIMB. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn mentioning the thing to Mr. Huxley he at once resolved to accompany\r\nus. On the 11th of August the weather was exceedingly fine, though the\r\nsnow which had fallen during the previous days lay thick upon the\r\nglacier. At noon we were all together at the Tacul, and the subject of\r\nattempting Mont Blanc was mooted and discussed. My opinion was that it\r\nwould be better to wait until the fresh snow which loaded the mountain\r\nhad disappeared; but the weather was so exquisite that my friends\r\nthought it best to take advantage of it. We accordingly entered into an\r\nagreement with our guide, and immediately descended to make preparations\r\nfor commencing the expedition on the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ASCENT OF MONT BLANC, 1857.\r\n\r\n(11.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCENE FROM THE CHARMOZ. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 12th of August, we rose early, after a very brief rest\r\non my part. Simond had proposed to go down to Chamouni, and commence the\r\nascent in the usual way, but we preferred crossing the mountains from\r\nthe Montanvert, straight to the Glacier des Bossons. At eight o'clock we\r\nstarted, accompanied by two porters who were to carry our provisions to\r\nthe Grands Mulets. Slowly and silently we climbed the hill-side towards\r\nCharmoz. We soon passed the limits of grass and rhododendrons, and\r\nreached the slabs of gneiss which overspread the summit of the ridge,\r\nlying one upon the other like coin upon the table of a money-changer.\r\nFrom the highest-point I turned to have a last look at the Mer de Glace;\r\nand through a pair of very dark spectacles I could see with perfect\r\ndistinctness the looped dirt-bands of the glacier, which to the naked\r\neye are scarcely discernible except by twilight. Flanking our track to\r\nthe left rose a series of mighty Aiguilles--the Aiguille de Charmoz,\r\nwith its bent and rifted pinnacles; the Aiguille du Grepon, the Aiguille\r\nde Blaitiere, the Aiguille du Midi, all piercing the heavens with their\r\nsharp pyramidal summits. Far in front of us rose the grand snow-cone of\r\nthe Dome du Gouter, while, through a forest of dark pines which gathered\r\nlike a cloud at the foot of the mountain, gleamed the white minarets of\r\nthe Glacier des Bossons. Below us lay the Valley of Chamouni, beyond\r\nwhich were the Brevent and the chain of the Aiguilles Rouges; behind us\r\nwas the granite obelisk of the Aiguille du Dru, while close at hand\r\nscience found a corporeal form in a pyramid of stones used as a\r\ntrigonometrical station by Professor Forbes. Sound is known to travel\r\nbetter up hill than down, because the pulses transmitted from a denser\r\nmedium to a rarer, suffer less loss of intensity than when the\r\ntransmission is in the opposite direction; and now the mellow voice of\r\nthe Arve came swinging upwards from the heavier air of the valley to the\r\nlighter air of the hills in rich deep cadences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PASSAGE TO THE PIERRE A L'ECHELLE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nThe way for a time was excessively rough, our route being overspread\r\nwith the fragments of peaks which had once reared themselves to our\r\nleft, but which frost and lightning had shaken to pieces, and poured in\r\ngranite avalanches down the mountain. We were sometimes among huge\r\nangular boulders, and sometimes amid lighter shingle, which gave way at\r\nevery step, thus forcing us to shift our footing incessantly. Escaping\r\nfrom these, we crossed the succession of secondary glaciers which lie at\r\nthe feet of the Aiguilles, and having secured firewood found ourselves\r\nafter some hours of hard work at the Pierre a l'Echelle. Here we were\r\nfurnished with leggings of coarse woollen cloth to keep out the snow;\r\nthey were tied under the knees and quite tightly again over the insteps,\r\nso that the legs were effectually protected. We had some refreshment,\r\npossessed ourselves of the ladder, and entered upon the glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LADDER LEFT BEHIND. 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFICULT CREVASSES. 1857.]\r\n\r\nThe ice was excessively fissured: we crossed crevasses and crept round\r\nslippery ridges, cutting steps in the ice wherever climbing was\r\nnecessary. This rendered our progress very slow. Once, with the\r\nintention of lending a helping hand, I stepped forward upon a block of\r\ngranite which happened to be poised like a rocking stone upon the ice,\r\nthough I did not know it; it treacherously turned under me; I fell, but\r\nmy hands were in instant requisition, and I escaped with a bruise, from\r\nwhich, however, the blood oozed angrily. We found the ladder necessary\r\nin crossing some of the chasms, the iron spikes at its end being firmly\r\ndriven into the ice at one side, while the other end rested on the\r\nopposite side of the fissure. The middle portion of the glacier was not\r\ndifficult. Mounds of ice rose beside us right and left, which were\r\nsometimes split into high towers and gaunt-looking pyramids, while the\r\nspace between was unbroken. Twenty minutes' walking brought us again to\r\na fissured portion of the glacier, and here our porter left the ladder\r\non the ice behind him. For some time I was not aware of this, but we\r\nwere soon fronted by a chasm to pass which we were in consequence\r\ncompelled to make a long and dangerous circuit amid crests of crumbling\r\nice. This accomplished, we hoped that no repetition of the process would\r\noccur, but we speedily came to a second fissure, where it was necessary\r\nto step from a projecting end of ice to a mass of soft snow which\r\noverhung the opposite side. Simond could reach this snow with his\r\nlong-handled axe; he beat it down to give it rigidity, but it was\r\nexceedingly tender, and as he worked at it he continued to express his\r\nfears that it would not bear us. I was the lightest of the party, and\r\ntherefore tested the passage, first; being partially lifted by Simond on\r\nthe end of his axe, I crossed the fissure, obtained some anchorage at\r\nthe other side, and helped the others over. We afterwards ascended until\r\nanother chasm, deeper and wider than any we had hitherto encountered,\r\narrested us. We walked alongside of it in search of a snow bridge, which\r\nwe at length found, but the keystone of the arch had unfortunately given\r\nway, leaving projecting eaves of snow at both sides, between which we\r\ncould look into the gulf, till the gloom of its deeper portions cut the\r\nvision short. Both sides of the crevasse were sounded, but no sure\r\nfooting was obtained; the snow was beaten and carefully trodden down as\r\nnear to the edge as possible, but it finally broke away from the foot\r\nand fell into the chasm. One of our porters was short-legged and a bad\r\niceman; the other was a daring fellow, and he now threw the knapsack\r\nfrom his shoulders, came to the edge of the crevasse, looked into it,\r\nbut drew back again. After a pause he repeated the act, testing the snow\r\nwith his feet and staff. I looked at the man as he stood beside the\r\nchasm manifestly undecided as to whether he should take the step upon\r\nwhich his life would hang, and thought it advisable to put a stop to\r\nsuch perilous play. I accordingly interposed, the man withdrew from the\r\ncrevasse, and he and Simond descended to fetch the ladder. While they\r\nwere away Huxley sat down upon the ice, with an expression of fatigue\r\nstamped upon his countenance: the spirit and the muscles were evidently\r\nat war, and the resolute will mixed itself strangely with the sense of\r\nperil and feeling of exhaustion. He had been only two days with us, and,\r\nthough his strength is great, he had had no opportunity of hardening\r\nhimself by previous exercise upon the ice for the task which he had\r\nundertaken. The ladder now arrived, and we crossed the crevasse. I was\r\nintentionally the last of the party, Huxley being immediately in front\r\nof me. The determination of the man disguised his real condition from\r\neverybody but myself, but I saw that the exhausting journey over the\r\nboulders and debris had been too much for his London limbs. Converting\r\nmy waterproof haversack into a cushion, I made him sit down upon it at\r\nintervals, and by thus breaking the steep ascent into short stages we\r\nreached the cabin of the Grands Mulets together. Here I spread a rug on\r\nthe boards, and placing my bag for a pillow, he lay down, and after an\r\nhour's profound sleep he rose refreshed and well; but still he thought\r\nit wise not to attempt the ascent farther. Our porters left us: a baton\r\nwas stretched across the room over the stove, and our wet socks and\r\nleggings were thrown across it to dry; our boots were placed around the\r\nfire, and we set about preparing our evening meal. A pan was placed upon\r\nthe fire, and filled with snow, which in due time melted and boiled; I\r\nground some chocolate and placed it in the pan, and afterwards ladled\r\nthe beverage into the vessels we possessed, which consisted of two\r\nearthen dishes and the metal cases of our brandy flasks. After supper\r\nSimond went out to inspect the glacier, and was observed by Huxley, as\r\ntwilight fell, in a state of deep contemplation beside a crevasse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STAR TWINKLING. 1857.]\r\n\r\nGradually the stars appeared, but as yet no moon. Before lying down we\r\nwent out to look at the firmament, and noticed, what I suppose has been\r\nobserved to some extent by everybody, that the stars near the horizon\r\ntwinkled busily, while those near the zenith shone with a steady light.\r\nOne large star in particular excited our admiration; it flashed\r\nintensely, and changed colour incessantly, sometimes blushing like a\r\nruby, and again gleaming like an emerald. A determinate colour would\r\nsometimes remain constant for a sensible time, but usually the flashes\r\nfollowed each other in very quick succession. Three planks were now\r\nplaced across the room near the stove, and upon these, with their rugs\r\nfolded round them, Huxley and Hirst stretched themselves, while I\r\nnestled on the boards at the most distant end of the room. We rose at\r\neleven o'clock, renewed the fire and warmed ourselves, after which we\r\nlay down again. I at length observed a patch of pale light upon the\r\nwooden wall of the cabin, which had entered through a hole in the end of\r\nthe edifice, and rising found that it was past one o'clock. The\r\ncloudless moon was shining over the wastes of snow, and the scene\r\noutside was at once wild, grand, and beautiful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: START FROM THE GRANDS MULETS. 1857.]\r\n\r\nBreakfast was soon prepared, though not without difficulty; we had no\r\ncandles, they had been forgotten; but I fortunately possessed a box of\r\nwax matches, of which Huxley took charge, patiently igniting them in\r\nsuccession, and thus giving us a tolerably continuous light. We had\r\nsome tea, which had been made at the Montanvert, and carried to the\r\nGrands Mulets in a bottle. My memory of that tea is not pleasant; it had\r\nbeen left a whole night in contact with its leaves, and smacked strongly\r\nof tannin. The snow-water, moreover, with which we diluted it was not\r\npure, but left a black residuum at the bottom of the dishes in which the\r\nbeverage was served. The few provisions deemed necessary being placed in\r\nSimond's knapsack, at twenty minutes past two o'clock we scrambled down\r\nthe rocks, leaving Huxley behind us.\r\n\r\nThe snow was hardened by the night's frost, and we were cheered by the\r\nhope of being able to accomplish the ascent with comparatively little\r\nlabour. We were environed by an atmosphere of perfect purity; the larger\r\nstars hung like gems above us, and the moon, about half full, shone with\r\nwondrous radiance in the dark firmament. One star in particular, which\r\nlay eastward from the moon, suddenly made its appearance above one of\r\nthe Aiguilles, and burned there with unspeakable splendour. We turned\r\nonce towards the Mulets, and saw Huxley's form projected against the sky\r\nas he stood upon a pinnacle of rock; he gave us a last wave of the hand\r\nand descended, while we receded from him into the solitudes.\r\n\r\nThe evening previous our guide had examined the glacier for some\r\ndistance, his progress having been arrested by a crevasse. Beside this\r\nwe soon halted: it was spanned at one place by a bridge of snow, which\r\nwas of too light a structure to permit of Simond's testing it alone; we\r\ntherefore paused while our guide uncoiled a rope and tied us all\r\ntogether. The moment was to me a peculiarly solemn one. Our little party\r\nseemed so lonely and so small amid the silence and the vastness of the\r\nsurrounding scene. We were about to try our strength under unknown\r\nconditions, and as the various possibilities of the enterprise crowded\r\non the imagination, a sense of responsibility for a moment oppressed\r\nme. But as I looked aloft and saw the glory of the heavens, my heart\r\nlightened, and I remarked cheerily to Hirst that Nature seemed to smile\r\nupon our work. \"Yes,\" he replied, in a calm and earnest voice, \"and, God\r\nwilling, we shall accomplish it.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A WRONG TURN. 1857.]\r\n\r\nA pale light now overspread the eastern sky, which increased, as we\r\nascended, to a daffodil tinge; this afterwards heightened to orange,\r\ndeepening at one extremity into red, and fading at the other into a pure\r\nethereal hue to which it would be difficult to assign a special name.\r\nHigher up the sky was violet, and this changed by insensible degrees\r\ninto the darkling blue of the zenith, which had to thank the light of\r\nmoon and stars alone for its existence. We wound steadily for a time\r\nthrough valleys of ice, climbed white and slippery slopes, crossed a\r\nnumber of crevasses, and after some time found ourselves beside a chasm\r\nof great depth and width, which extended right and left as far as we\r\ncould see. We turned to the left, and marched along its edge in search\r\nof a _pont_; but matters became gradually worse: other crevasses joined\r\non to the first one, and the further we proceeded the more riven and\r\ndislocated the ice became. At length we reached a place where further\r\nadvance was impossible. Simond in his difficulty complained of the want\r\nof light, and wished us to wait for the advancing day; I, on the\r\ncontrary, thought that we had light enough and ought to make use of it.\r\nHere the thought occurred to me that Simond, having been only once\r\nbefore to the top of the mountain, might not be quite clear about the\r\nroute; the glacier, however, changes within certain limits from year to\r\nyear, so that a general knowledge was all that could be expected, and we\r\ntrusted to our own muscles to make good any mistake in the way of\r\nguidance. We now turned and retraced our steps along the edges of chasms\r\nwhere the ice was disintegrated and insecure, and succeeded at length\r\nin finding a bridge which bore us across the crevasse. This error caused\r\nus the loss of an hour, and after walking for this time we could cast a\r\nstone from the point we had attained to the place whence we had been\r\ncompelled to return.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SERACS OF THE DOME DU GOUTER. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOur way now lay along the face of a steep incline of snow, which was cut\r\nby the fissure we had just passed, in a direction parallel to our route.\r\nOn the heights to our right, loose ice-crags seemed to totter, and we\r\npassed two tracks over which the frozen blocks had rushed some short\r\ntime previously. We were glad to get out of the range of these terrible\r\nprojectiles, and still more so to escape the vicinity of that ugly\r\ncrevasse. To be killed in the open air would be a luxury, compared with\r\nhaving the life squeezed out of one in the horrible gloom of these\r\nchasms. The blush of the coming day became more and more intense; still\r\nthe sun himself did not appear, being hidden from us by the peaks of the\r\nAiguille du Midi, which were drawn clear and sharp against the\r\nbrightening sky. Right under this Aiguille were heaps of snow smoothly\r\nrounded and constituting a portion of the sources whence the Glacier du\r\nGeant is fed; these, as the day advanced, bloomed with a rosy light. We\r\nreached the Petit Plateau, which we found covered with the remains of\r\nice avalanches; above us upon the crest of the mountain rose three\r\nmighty bastions, divided from each other by deep vertical rents, with\r\nclean smooth walls, across which the lines of annual bedding were drawn\r\nlike courses of masonry. From these, which incessantly renew themselves,\r\nand from the loose and broken ice-crags near them, the boulders amid\r\nwhich we now threaded our way had been discharged. When they fall their\r\ndescent must be sublime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LOST GUIDES. 1857.]\r\n\r\nThe snow had been gradually getting deeper, and the ascent more\r\nwearisome, but superadded to this at the Petit Plateau was the\r\nuncertainty of the footing between the blocks of ice. In many places\r\nthe space was merely covered by a thin crust, which, when trod upon,\r\ninstantly yielded, and we sank with a shock sometimes to the hips. Our\r\nway next lay up a steep incline to the Grand Plateau, the depth and\r\ntenderness of the snow augmenting as we ascended. We had not yet seen\r\nthe sun, but, as we attained the brow which forms the entrance to the\r\nGrand Plateau, he hung his disk upon a spike of rock to our left, and,\r\nsurrounded by a glory of interference spectra of the most gorgeous\r\ncolours, blazed down upon us. On the Grand Plateau we halted and had our\r\nfrugal refreshment. At some distance to our left was the crevasse into\r\nwhich Dr. Hamel's three guides were precipitated by an avalanche in\r\n1820; they are still entombed in the ice, and some future explorer may\r\nperhaps see them disgorged lower down, fresh and undecayed. They can\r\nhardly reach the surface until they pass the snow-line of the glacier,\r\nfor above this line the quantity of snow that annually falls being in\r\nexcess of the quantity melted, the tendency would be to make the\r\nice-covering above them thicker. But it is also possible that the waste\r\nof the ice underneath may have brought the bodies to the bed of the\r\nglacier, where their very bones may have been ground to mud by an agency\r\nwhich the hardest rocks cannot withstand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GUIDE TIRED. 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A PERILOUS SLOPE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nAs the sun poured his light upon the Plateau the little snow-facets\r\nsparkled brilliantly, sometimes with a pure white light, and at others\r\nwith prismatic colours. Contrasted with the white spaces above and\r\naround us were the dark mountains on the opposite side of the valley of\r\nChamouni, around which fantastic masses of cloud were beginning to build\r\nthemselves. Mont Buet, with its cone of snow, looked small, and the\r\nBrevent altogether mean; the limestone bastions of the Fys, however,\r\nstill presented a front of gloom and grandeur. We traversed the Grand\r\nPlateau, and at length reached the base of an extremely steep incline\r\nwhich stretched upwards towards the Corridor. Here, as if produced by a\r\nfault, consequent upon the sinking of the ice in front, rose a vertical\r\nprecipice, from the coping of which vast stalactites of ice depended.\r\nPrevious to reaching this place I had noticed a haggard expression upon\r\nthe countenance of our guide, which was now intensified by the prospect\r\nof the ascent before him. Hitherto he had always been in front, which\r\nwas certainly the most fatiguing position. I felt that I must now take\r\nthe lead, so I spoke cheerily to the man and placed him behind me.\r\nMarking a number of points upon the slope as resting places, I went\r\nswiftly from one to the other. The surface of the snow had been\r\npartially melted by the sun and then refrozen, thus forming a\r\nsuperficial crust, which bore the weight up to a certain point, and then\r\nsuddenly gave way, permitting the leg to sink to above the knee. The\r\nshock consequent on this, and the subsequent effort necessary to\r\nextricate the leg, were extremely fatiguing. My motion was complained of\r\nas too quick, and my tracks as imperfect; I moderated the former, and,\r\nto render my footholes broad and sure, I stamped upon the frozen crust,\r\nand twisted my legs in the soft mass underneath,--a terribly exhausting\r\nprocess. I thus led the way to the base of the Rochers Rouges, up to\r\nwhich the fault already referred to had prolonged itself as a crevasse,\r\nwhich was roofed at one place by a most dangerous-looking snow-bridge.\r\nSimond came to the front; I drew his attention to the state of the snow,\r\nand proposed climbing the Rochers Rouges; but, with a promptness unusual\r\nwith him, he replied that this was impossible; the bridge was our only\r\nmeans of passing, and we must try it. We grasped our ropes, and dug our\r\nfeet firmly into the snow to check the man's descent if the _pont_ gave\r\nway, but to our astonishment it bore him, and bore us safely after him.\r\nThe slope which we had now to ascend had the snow swept from its\r\nsurface, and was therefore firm ice. It was most dangerously steep, and,\r\nits termination being the fretted coping of the precipice to which I\r\nhave referred, if we slid downwards we should shoot over this and be\r\ndashed to pieces upon the ice below.[A] Simond, who had come to the\r\nfront to cross the crevasse, was now engaged in cutting steps, which he\r\nmade deep and large, so that they might serve us on our return. But the\r\nlistless strokes of his axe proclaimed his exhaustion; so I took the\r\nimplement out of his hands, and changed places with him. Step after step\r\nwas hewn, but the top of the Corridor appeared ever to recede from us.\r\nHirst was behind unoccupied, and could thus turn his thoughts to the\r\nperil of our position: he _felt_ the angle on which we hung, and saw the\r\nedge of the precipice, to which less than a quarter of a minute's slide\r\nwould carry us, and for the first time during the journey he grew giddy.\r\nA cigar which he lighted for the purpose tranquilized him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILL AND MUSCLE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nI hewed sixty steps upon this slope, and each step had cost a minute, by\r\nHirst's watch. The Mur de la Cote was still before us, and on this the\r\nguide-books informed us two or three hundred steps were sometimes found\r\nnecessary. If sixty steps cost an hour, what would be the cost of two\r\nhundred? The question was disheartening in the extreme, for the time at\r\nwhich we had calculated on reaching the summit was already passed, while\r\nthe chief difficulties remained unconquered. Having hewn our way along\r\nthe harder ice we reached snow. I again resorted to stamping to secure a\r\nfooting, and while thus engaged became, for the first time, aware of the\r\ndrain of force to which I was subjecting myself. The thought of being\r\nabsolutely exhausted had never occurred to me, and from first to last I\r\nhad taken no care to husband my strength. I always calculated that the\r\n_will_ would serve me even should the muscles fail, but I now found that\r\nmechanical laws rule man in the long run; that no effort of will, no\r\npower of spirit, can draw beyond a certain limit upon muscular force.\r\nThe soul, it is true, can stir the body to action, but its function is\r\nto excite and apply force, and not to create it.\r\n\r\nWhile stamping forward through the frozen crust I was compelled to pause\r\nat short intervals; then would set out again apparently fresh, to find,\r\nhowever, in a few minutes that my strength was gone, and that I required\r\nto rest once more. In this way I gained the summit of the Corridor, when\r\nHirst came to the front, and I felt some relief in stepping slowly after\r\nhim, making use of the holes into which his feet had sunk. He thus led\r\nthe way to the base of the Mur de la Cote, the thought of which had so\r\nlong cast a gloom upon us; here we left our rope behind us, and while\r\npausing I asked Simond whether he did not feel a desire to go to the\r\nsummit--\"_Bien sur_,\" was his reply, \"_mais!_\" Our guide's mind was so\r\nconstituted that the \"_mais_\" seemed essential to its peace. I stretched\r\nmy hand towards him, and said, \"Simond, we must do it.\" One thing alone\r\nI felt could defeat us: the usual time of the ascent had been more than\r\ndoubled, the day was already far spent, and if the ascent would throw\r\nour subsequent descent into night it could not be contemplated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DOZE ON THE CALOTTE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nWe now faced the Mur, which was by no means so bad as we had expected.\r\nDriving the iron claws of our boots into the scars made by the axe, and\r\nthe spikes of our batons into the slope above our feet, we ascended\r\nsteadily until the summit was attained, and the top of the mountain rose\r\nclearly above us. We congratulated ourselves upon this; but Simond,\r\nprobably fearing that our joy might become too full, remarked, \"_Mais le\r\nsommet est encore bien loin!_\" It was, alas! too true. The snow became\r\nsoft again, and our weary limbs sank in it as before. Our guide went on\r\nin front, audibly muttering his doubts as to our ability to reach the\r\ntop, and at length he threw himself upon the snow, and exclaimed, \"_Il\r\nfaut y renoncer!_\" Hirst now undertook the task of rekindling the\r\nguide's enthusiasm, after which Simond rose, exclaiming, \"_Ah! comme ca\r\nme fait mal aux genoux_,\" and went forward. Two rocks break through the\r\nsnow between the summit of the Mur and the top of the mountain; the\r\nfirst is called the Petits Mulets, and the highest the Derniers Rochers.\r\nAt the former of these we paused to rest, and finished our scanty store\r\nof wine and provisions. We had not a bit of bread nor a drop of wine\r\nleft; our brandy flasks were also nearly exhausted, and thus we had to\r\ncontemplate the journey to the summit, and the subsequent descent to the\r\nGrands Mulets, without the slightest prospect of physical refreshment.\r\nThe almost total loss of two nights' sleep, with two days' toil\r\nsuperadded, made me long for a few minutes' doze, so I stretched myself\r\nupon a composite couch of snow and granite, and immediately fell asleep.\r\nMy friend, however, soon aroused me. \"You quite frighten me,\" he said;\r\n\"I have listened for some minutes, and have not heard you breathe once.\"\r\nI had, in reality, been taking deep draughts of the mountain air, but so\r\nsilently as not to be heard.\r\n\r\nI now filled our empty wine-bottle with snow and placed it in the\r\nsunshine, that we might have a little water on our return. We then rose;\r\nit was half-past two o'clock; we had been upwards of twelve hours\r\nclimbing, and I calculated that, whether we reached the summit or not,\r\nwe could at all events work _towards_ it for another hour. To the sense\r\nof fatigue previously experienced, a new phenomenon was now added--the\r\nbeating of the heart. We were incessantly pulled up by this, which\r\nsometimes became so intense as to suggest danger. I counted the number\r\nof paces which we were able to accomplish without resting, and found\r\nthat at the end of every twenty, sometimes at the end of fifteen, we\r\nwere compelled to pause. At each pause my heart throbbed audibly, as I\r\nleaned upon my staff, and the subsidence of this action was always the\r\nsignal for further advance. My breathing was quick, but light and\r\nunimpeded. I endeavoured to ascertain whether the hip-joint, on account\r\nof the diminished atmospheric pressure, became loosened, so as to throw\r\nthe weight of the leg upon the surrounding ligaments, but could not be\r\ncertain about it. I also sought a little aid and encouragement from\r\nphilosophy, endeavouring to remember what great things had been done by\r\nthe accumulation of small quantities, and I urged upon myself that the\r\npresent was a case in point, and that the summation of distances twenty\r\npaces each must finally place us at the top. Still the question of time\r\nleft the matter long in doubt, and until we had passed the Derniers\r\nRochers we worked on with the stern indifference of men who were doing\r\ntheir duty, and did not look to consequences. Here, however, a gleam of\r\nhope began to brighten our souls; the summit became visibly nearer,\r\nSimond showed more alacrity; at length success became certain, and at\r\nhalf-past three P.M. my friend and I clasped hands upon the top.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SUMMIT ATTAINED. 1857.]\r\n\r\nThe summit of the mountain is an elongated ridge, which has been\r\ncompared to the back of an ass. It was perfectly manifest that we were\r\ndominant over all other mountains; as far as the eye could range Mont\r\nBlanc had no competitor. The summits which had looked down upon us in\r\nthe morning were now far beneath us. The Dome du Gouter, which had held\r\nits threatening _seracs_ above us so long, was now at our feet. The\r\nAiguille du Midi, Mont Blanc du Tacul, and the Monts Maudits, the\r\nTalefre with its surrounding peaks, the Grand Jorasse, Mont Mallet, and\r\nthe Aiguille du Geant, with our own familiar glaciers, were all below\r\nus. And as our eye ranged over the broad shoulders of the mountain, over\r\nice hills and valleys, plateaux and far-stretching slopes of snow, the\r\nconception of its magnitude grew upon us, and impressed us more and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLOUDS FROM THE SUMMIT. 1857.]\r\n\r\nThe clouds were very grand--grander indeed than anything I had ever\r\nbefore seen. Some of them seemed to hold thunder in their breasts, they\r\nwere so dense and dark; others, with their faces turned sunward, shone\r\nwith the dazzling whiteness of the mountain snow; while others again\r\nbuilt themselves into forms resembling gigantic elm trees, loaded with\r\nfoliage. Towards the horizon the luxury of colour added itself to the\r\nmagnificent alternations of light and shade. Clear spaces of amber and\r\nethereal green embraced the red and purple cumuli, and seemed to form\r\nthe cradle in which they swung. Closer at hand squally mists, suddenly\r\nengendered, were driven hither and thither by local winds; while the\r\nclouds at a distance lay \"like angels sleeping on the wing,\" with\r\nscarcely visible motion. Mingling with the clouds, and sometimes rising\r\nabove them, were the highest mountain heads, and as our eyes wandered\r\nfrom peak to peak, onwards to the remote horizon, space itself seemed\r\nmore vast from the manner in which the objects which it held were\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTENSITY OF SOUND. 1857.]\r\n\r\nI wished to repeat the remarkable experiment of De Saussure upon sound,\r\nand for this purpose had requested Simond to bring a pistol from\r\nChamouni; but in the multitude of his cares he forgot it, and in lieu of\r\nit my host at the Montanvert had placed in two tin tubes, of the same\r\nsize and shape, the same amount of gunpowder, securely closing the tubes\r\nafterwards, and furnishing each of them with a small lateral aperture.\r\nWe now planted one of them upon the snow, and bringing a strip of amadou\r\ninto communication with the touchhole, ignited its most distant end: it\r\nfailed; we tried again, and were successful, the explosion tearing\r\nasunder the little case which contained the powder. The sound was\r\ncertainly not so great as I should have expected from an equal quantity\r\nof powder at the sea level.[B]\r\n\r\nThe snow upon the summit was indurated, but of an exceedingly fine\r\ngrain, and the beautiful effect already referred to as noticed upon the\r\nStelvio was strikingly manifest. The hole made by driving the baton into\r\nthe snow was filled with a delicate blue light; and, by management, its\r\ncomplementary pinky yellow could also be produced. Even the iron spike\r\nat the end of the baton made a hole sufficiently deep to exhibit the\r\nblue colour, which certainly depends on the size and arrangement of the\r\nsnow crystals. The firmament above us was without a cloud, and of a\r\ndarkness almost equal to that which surrounded the moon at 2 A.M. Still,\r\nthough the sun was shining, a breeze, whose tooth had been sharpened by\r\nits passage over the snow-fields, searched us through and through. The\r\nday was also waning, and, urged by the warnings of our ever prudent\r\nguide, we at length began the descent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN UNEXPECTED GLISSADE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nGravity was now in our favour, but gravity could not entirely spare our\r\nwearied limbs, and where we sank in the snow we found our downward\r\nprogress very trying. I suffered from thirst, but after we had divided\r\nthe liquefied snow at the Petits Mulets amongst us we had nothing to\r\ndrink. I crammed the clean snow into my mouth, but the process of\r\nmelting was slow and tantalizing to a parched throat, while the chill\r\nwas painful to the teeth. We marched along the Corridor, and crossed\r\ncautiously the perilous slope on which we had cut steps in the morning,\r\nbreathing more freely after we had cleared the ice-precipice before\r\ndescribed. Along the base of this precipice we now wound, diverging from\r\nour morning's track, in order to get surer footing in the snow; it was\r\nlike flour, and while descending to the Grand Plateau we sometimes sank\r\nin it nearly to the waist. When I endeavoured to squeeze it, so as to\r\nfill my flask, it at first refused to cling together, behaving like so\r\nmuch salt; the heat of the hand, however, soon rendered it a little\r\nmoist, and capable of being pressed into compact masses. The sun met us\r\nhere with extraordinary power; the heat relaxed my muscles, but when\r\nfairly immersed in the shadow of the Dome du Gouter, the coolness\r\nrestored my strength, which augmented as the evening advanced. Simond\r\ninsisted on the necessity of haste, to save us from the perils of\r\ndarkness. \"_On peut perir_\" was his repeated admonition, and he was\r\nquite right. We reached the region of _ponts_, more weary, but, in\r\ncompensation, more callous, than we had been in the morning, and moved\r\nover the soft snow of the bridges as if we had been walking upon eggs.\r\nThe valley of Chamouni was filled with brown-red clouds, which crept\r\ntowards us up the mountain; the air around and above us was, however,\r\nclear, and the chastened light told us that day was departing. Once as\r\nwe hung upon a steep slope, where the snow was exceedingly soft, Hirst\r\nomitted to make his footing sure; the soft mass gave way, and he fell,\r\nuttering a startled shout as he went down the declivity. I was attached\r\nto him, and, fixing my feet suddenly in the snow, endeavoured to check\r\nhis fall, but I seemed a mere feather in opposition to the force with\r\nwhich he descended.[C] I fell, and went down after him; and we carried\r\nquite an avalanche of snow along with us, in which we were almost\r\ncompletely hidden at the bottom of the slope. All further dangers,\r\nhowever, were soon past, and we went at a headlong speed to the base of\r\nthe Grands Mulets; the sound of our batons against the rocks calling\r\nHuxley forth. A position more desolate than his had been can hardly be\r\nimagined. For seventeen hours he had been there. He had expected us at\r\ntwo o'clock in the afternoon; the hours came and passed, and till seven\r\nin the evening he had looked for us. \"To the end of my life,\" he said,\r\n\"I shall never forget the sound of those batons.\" It was his turn now to\r\nnurse me, which he did, repaying my previous care of him with high\r\ninterest. We were all soon stretched, and, in spite of cold and hard\r\nboards, I slept at intervals; but the night, on the whole, was a weary\r\none, and we rose next morning with muscles more tired than when we lay\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BLIND AMID THE CREVASSES. 1857.]\r\n\r\n_Friday, 14th August._--Hirst was almost blind this morning; and our\r\nguide's eyes were also greatly inflamed. We gathered our things\r\ntogether, and bade the Grands Mulets farewell. It had frozen hard during\r\nthe night, and this, on the steeper slopes, rendered the footing very\r\ninsecure. Simond, moreover, appeared to be a little bewildered, and I\r\nsometimes preceded him in cutting the steps, while Hirst moved among the\r\ncrevasses like a blind man; one of us keeping near him, so that he might\r\nfeel for the actual places where our feet had rested, and place his own\r\nin the same position. It cost us three hours to cross from the Grands\r\nMulets to the Pierre a l'Echelle, where we discarded our leggings, had a\r\nmouthful of food, and a brief rest. Once upon the safe earth Simond's\r\npowers seemed to be restored, and he led us swiftly downwards to the\r\nlittle auberge beside the Cascade du Tard, where we had some excellent\r\nlemonade, equally choice cognac, fresh strawberries and cream. How sweet\r\nthey were, and how beautiful we thought the peasant girl who served\r\nthem! Our guide kept a little hotel, at which we halted, and found it\r\nclean and comfortable. We were, in fact, totally unfit to go elsewhere.\r\nMy coat was torn, holes were kicked through my boots, and I was\r\naltogether ragged and shabby. A warm bath before dinner refreshed all\r\nmightily. Dense clouds now lowered upon Mont Blanc, and we had not been\r\nan hour at Chamouni when the breaking up of the weather was announced by\r\na thunder-peal. We had accomplished our journey just in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Those acquainted with the mountain will at once recognise the grave\r\nerror here committed. In fact on starting from the Grands Mulets we had\r\ncrossed the glacier too far, and throughout were much too close to the\r\nDome du Gouter.\r\n\r\n[B] I fired the second case in a field in Hampshire, and, as far as my\r\nmemory enabled me to make the comparison, found its sound considerably\r\n_denser_, if I may use the expression. In 1859 I had a pistol fired at\r\nthe summit of Mont Blanc: its sound was sensibly feebler and _shorter_\r\nthan in the valley; it resembled somewhat the discharge of a cork from a\r\nchampagne bottle, though much louder, but it could not be at all\r\ncompared to the sound of a common cracker.\r\n\r\n[C] I believe that I could stop him now (1860).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(12.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HAPPY EVENINGS. 1857.]\r\n\r\nAfter our return we spent every available hour upon the ice, working at\r\nquestions which shall be treated under their proper heads, each day's\r\nwork being wound up by an evening of perfect enjoyment. Roast mutton and\r\nfried potatoes were our incessant fare, for which, after a little\r\nlonging for a change at first, we contracted a final and permanent love.\r\nAs the year advanced, moreover, and the grass sprouted with augmented\r\nvigour on the slopes of the Montanvert, the mutton, as predicted by our\r\nhost, became more tender and juicy. We had also some capital Sallenches\r\nbeer, cold as the glacier water, but effervescent as champagne. Such\r\nwere our food and drink. After dinner we gathered round the pine-fire,\r\nand I can hardly think it possible for three men to be more happy than\r\nwe then were. It was not the goodness of the conversation, nor any high\r\nintellectual element, which gave the charm to our gatherings; the\r\ngladness grew naturally out of our own perfect health, and out of the\r\ncircumstances of our position. Every fibre seemed a repository of latent\r\njoy, which the slightest stimulus sufficed to bring into conscious\r\naction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A GLACIER \"BLOWER.\" 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th I penetrated with Simond through thick gloom to the Tacul;\r\non the 18th we set stakes at the same place: on the same day, while\r\ncrossing the medial moraine of the Talefre, a little below the cascade,\r\na singular noise attracted my attention; it seemed at first as if a\r\nsnake were hissing about my feet. On changing my position the sound\r\nsuddenly ceased, but it soon recommenced. There was some snow upon the\r\nglacier, which I removed, and placed my ear close to the ice, but it was\r\ndifficult to fix on the precise spot from which the sound issued. I cut\r\naway the disintegrated portion of the surface, and at length discovered\r\na minute crack, from which a stream of air issued, which I could feel as\r\na cold blast against my hand. While cutting away the surface further, I\r\nstopped the little \"blower.\" A marmot screamed near me, and while I\r\npaused to look at the creature scampering up the crags, the sound\r\ncommenced again, changing its note variously--hissing like a snake,\r\nsinging like a kettle, and sometimes chirruping intermittently like a\r\nbird. On passing my fingers to and fro over the crack, I obtained a\r\nsuccession of audible puffs; the current was sufficiently strong to blow\r\naway the corner of a gauze veil held over the fissure. Still the crack\r\nwas not wide enough to permit of the entrance of my finger nail; and to\r\nissue with such force from so minute a rent the air must have been under\r\nconsiderable pressure. The origin of the blower was in all probability\r\nthe following:--When the ice is recompacted after having descended a\r\ncascade, it is next to certain that chambers of air will be here and\r\nthere enclosed, which, being powerfully squeezed afterwards, will issue\r\nin the manner described whenever a crack in the ice furnishes it with a\r\nmeans of escape. In my experiments on flowing mud, for example, the air\r\nentrapped in the mass while descending from the sluice into the trough,\r\nbursts in bubbles from the surface at a short distance downwards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DIFFICULT LINE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nI afterwards examined the Talefre cascade from summit to base, with\r\nreference to the structure, until at the close of the day thickening\r\nclouds warned me off. I went down the glacier at a trot, guided by the\r\nboulders capped with little cairns which marked the route. The track\r\nwhich I had pursued for the last five weeks amid the crevasses near\r\nl'Angle was this day barely passable. The glacier had changed, my work\r\nwas drawing to a close, and, as I looked at the objects which had now\r\nbecome so familiar to me, I felt that, though not viscous, the ice did\r\nnot lack the quality of \"adhesiveness,\" and I felt a little sad at the\r\nthought of bidding it so soon farewell.\r\n\r\nAt some distance below the Montanvert the Mer de Glace is riven from\r\nside to side by transverse crevasses: these fissures indicate that the\r\nglacier where they occur is in a state of longitudinal strain which\r\nproduces transverse fracture. I wished to ascertain the amount of\r\nstretching which the glacier here demanded, and which the ice was not\r\nable to give; and for this purpose desired to compare the velocity of a\r\nline set out across the fissured portion with that of a second line\r\nstaked out across the ice before it had become thus fissured. A previous\r\ninspection of the glacier through the telescope of our theodolite\r\ninduced us to fix on a place which, though much riven, still did not\r\nexclude the hope of our being able to reach the other side. Each of us\r\nwas, as usual, armed with his own axe; and carrying with us suitable\r\nstakes, my guide and myself entered upon this portion of the glacier on\r\nthe morning of the 19th of August.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"NOUS NOUS TROUVERONS PERDUS!\" 1857.]\r\n\r\nI was surprised on entering to find some veins of white ice, which from\r\ntheir position and aspect appeared to be derived from the Glacier du\r\nGeant; but to these I shall subsequently refer. Our work was extremely\r\ndifficult; we penetrated to some distance along one line, but were\r\nfinally forced back, and compelled to try another. Right and left of us\r\nwere profound fissures, and once a cone of ice forty feet high leaned\r\nquite over our track. In front of us was a second leaning mass borne by\r\na mere stalk, and so topheavy that one wondered why the slight pedestal\r\non which it rested did not suddenly crack across. We worked slowly\r\nforwards, and soon found ourselves in the shadow of the topheavy mass\r\nabove referred to; and from which I escaped with a wounded hand, caused\r\nby over-haste. Simond surmounted the next ridge and exclaimed, \"_Nous\r\nnous trouverons perdus!_\" I reached his side, and on looking round the\r\nplace saw that there was no footing for man. The glacier here, as shown\r\nin the frontispiece, was cut up into thin wedges, separated from each\r\nother by profound chasms, and the wedges were so broken across as to\r\nrender creeping along their edges quite impossible. Thus brought to a\r\nstand, I fixed a stake at the point where we were forced to halt, and\r\nretreated along edges of detestable granular ice, which fell in showers\r\ninto the crevasses when struck by the axe. At one place an exceedingly\r\ndeep fissure was at our left, which was joined, at a sharp angle, by\r\nanother at our right, and we were compelled to cross at the place of\r\nintersection: to do this we had to trust ourselves to a projecting knob\r\nof that vile rotten ice which I had learned to fear since my experience\r\nof it on the Col du Geant. We finally escaped, and set out our line at\r\nanother place, where the glacier, though badly cut, was not impassable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FAREWELL TO THE MONTANVERT. 1857.]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th we made a series of final measurements at the Tacul, and\r\ndetermined the motion of two lines which we had set out the previous\r\nday. On the 21st we quitted the Montanvert; I had been there from the\r\n15th of July, and the longer I remained the better I liked the\r\nestablishment and the people connected with it. It was then managed by\r\nJoseph Tairraz and Jules Charlet, both of whom showed us every\r\nattention. In 1858 and 1859 I had occasion to revisit the establishment,\r\nwhich was then managed by Jules and his brother, and found in it the\r\nsame good qualities. During my winter expedition of 1859 I also found\r\nthe same readiness to assist me in every possible way; honest Jules\r\nexpressing his willingness to ascend through the snow to the auberge if\r\nI thought his presence would in any degree contribute to my comfort.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the glacier, and descended by the Chapeau to the Cascade des\r\nBois, the inclination of which and of the lower portion of the glacier\r\nwe then determined. The day was magnificent. Looking upwards, the\r\nAiguilles de Charmoz and du Dru rose right and left like sentinels of\r\nthe valley, while in front of us the ice descended the steep, a\r\nbewildering mass of crags and chasms. At the other side was the\r\npine-clad slope of the Montanvert. Further on the Aiguille du Midi threw\r\nits granite pyramid between us and Mont Blanc; on the Dome du Gouter the\r\n_seracs_ of the mountain were to be seen, while issuing as if from a\r\ncleft in the mountain side the Glacier des Bossons thrust through the\r\nblack pines its snowy tongue. Below us was the beautiful valley of\r\nChamouni itself, through which the Arve and Arveiron rushed like\r\nenlivening spirits. We finally examined a grand old moraine produced by\r\na Mer de Glace of other ages, when the ice quite crossed the valley of\r\nChamouni and abutted against the opposite mountain-wall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EDOUARD SIMOND. 1857.]\r\n\r\nSimond had proved himself a very valuable assistant; he was intelligent\r\nand perfectly trustworthy; and though the peculiar nature of my work\r\nsometimes caused me to attempt things against which his prudence\r\nprotested, he lacked neither strength nor courage. On reaching Chamouni\r\nand adding up our accounts, I found that I had not sufficient cash to\r\npay him; money was waiting for me at the post-office in Geneva, and\r\nthither it was arranged that my friend Hirst should proceed next\r\nmorning, while I was to await the arrival of the money at Chamouni. My\r\nguide heard of this arrangement, and divined its cause: he came to me,\r\nand in the most affectionate manner begged of me to accept from him the\r\nloan of 500 francs. Though I did not need the loan, the mode in which it\r\nwas offered to me augmented the kindly feelings which I had long\r\nentertained towards Simond, and I may add that my intercourse with him\r\nsince has served only to confirm my first estimate of his worthiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION OF 1858.\r\n\r\n(13.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DOUBTS REGARDING STRUCTURE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI had confined myself during the summer of 1857 to the Mer de Glace and\r\nits tributaries, desirous to make my knowledge accurate rather than\r\nextensive. I had made the acquaintance of all accessible parts of the\r\nglacier, and spared no pains to master both the details and the meaning\r\nof the laminated structure of the ice, but I found no fact upon which I\r\ncould take my stand and say to an advocate of an opposing theory, \"This\r\nis unassailable.\" In experimental science we have usually the power of\r\nchanging the conditions at pleasure; if Nature does not reply to a\r\nquestion we throw it into another form; a combining of conditions is, in\r\nfact, the essence of experiment. To meet the requirements of the present\r\nquestion, I could not twist the same glacier into various shapes, and\r\nthrow it into different states of strain and pressure; but I might, by\r\nvisiting many glaciers, find all needful conditions fulfilled in detail,\r\nand by observing these I hoped to confer upon the subject the character\r\nand precision of a true experimental inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1858 was accordingly devoted to this purpose, when I had\r\nthe good fortune to be accompanied by Professor Ramsay, the author of\r\nsome extremely interesting papers upon ancient glaciers. Taking Zuerich,\r\nSchaffhausen, and Lucerne in our way, we crossed the Bruenig on the 22nd\r\nof July, and met my guide, Christian Lauener, at Meyringen. On the 23rd\r\nwe visited the glacier of Rosenlaui, and the glacier of the\r\nSchwartzwald, and reached Grindelwald in the evening of the same day. My\r\nexpedition with Mr. Huxley had taught me that the Lower Grindelwald\r\nGlacier was extremely instructive, and I was anxious to see many parts\r\nof it once more; this I did, in company with Ramsay, and we also spent a\r\nday upon the upper glacier, after which our path lay over the Strahleck\r\nto the glaciers of the Aar and of the Rhone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE STRAHLECK.\r\n\r\n(14.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A GLOOMY PROSPECT. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 26th of July, we were called at 4 A.M., and found the\r\nweather very unpromising, but the two mornings which preceded it had\r\nalso been threatening without any evil result. There was, it is true,\r\nsomething more than usually hostile in the aspect of the clouds which\r\nsailed sullenly from the west, and smeared the air and mountains as if\r\nwith the dirty smoke of a manufacturing town. We despatched our coffee,\r\nwent down to the bottom of the Grindelwald valley, up the opposite\r\nslope, and were soon amid the gloom of the pines which partially cover\r\nit. On emerging from these, a watery gleam on the mottled head of the\r\nEiger was the only evidence of direct sunlight in that direction. To our\r\nleft was the Wetterhorn surrounded by wild and disorderly clouds,\r\nthrough the fissures of which the morning light glared strangely. For a\r\ntime the Heisse Platte was seen, a dark brown patch amid the ghastly\r\nblue which overspread the surrounding slopes of snow. The clouds once\r\nrolled up, and revealed for a moment the summits of the Viescherhoerner;\r\nbut they immediately settled down again, and hid the mountains from top\r\nto base. Soon afterwards they drew themselves partially aside, and a\r\npatch of blue over the Strahleck gave us hope and pleasure. As we\r\nascended, the prospect in front of us grew better, but that behind\r\nus--and the wind came from behind--grew worse. Slowly and stealthily the\r\ndense neutral-tint masses crept along the sides of the mountains, and\r\nseemed to dog us like spies; while over the glacier hung a thin veil of\r\nfog, through which gleamed the white minarets of the ice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ICE CASCADE AND PROTUBERANCES. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIRT-BANDS OF THE STRAHLECK BRANCH. 1858.]\r\n\r\nWhen we first spoke of crossing the Strahleck, Lauener said it would be\r\nnecessary to take two guides at least; but after a day's performance on\r\nthe ice he thought we might manage very well by taking, in addition to\r\nhimself, the herd of the alp, over the more difficult part of the pass.\r\nHe had further experience of us on the second day, and now, as we\r\napproached the herd's hut, I was amused to hear him say that he thought\r\nany assistance beside his own unnecessary. Relying upon ourselves,\r\ntherefore, we continued our route, and were soon upon the glacier, which\r\nhad been rendered smooth and slippery through the removal of its\r\ndisintegrated surface by the warm air. Crossing the Strahleck branch of\r\nthe glacier to its left side, we climbed the rocks to the grass and\r\nflowers which clothe the slopes above them. Our way sometimes lay over\r\nthese, sometimes along the beds of streams, across turbulent brooks, and\r\nonce around the face of a cliff, which afforded us about an inch of\r\nledge to stand upon, and some protruding splinters to lay hold of by the\r\nhands. Having reached a promontory which commanded a fine view of the\r\nglacier, and of the ice cascade by which it was fed, I halted, to check\r\nthe observations already made from the side of the opposite mountain.\r\nHere, as there, cliffy ridges were seen crossing the cascade of the\r\nglacier, with interposed spaces of dirt and debris--the former being\r\ntoned down, and the latter squeezed towards the base of the fall, until\r\nfinally the ridges swept across the glacier, in gentle swellings, from\r\nside to side; while the valleys between them, holding the principal\r\nshare of the superficial impurity, formed the cradles of the so-called\r\nDirt-Bands. These swept concentric with the protuberances across the\r\nglacier, and remained upon its surface even after the swellings had\r\ndisappeared. The swifter flow of the centre of the glacier tends of\r\ncourse incessantly to lengthen the loops of the bands, and to thrust the\r\nsummits of the curves which they form more and more in advance of their\r\nlateral portions. The depressions between the protuberances appeared to\r\nbe furrowed by minor wrinkles, as if the ice of the depressions had\r\nyielded more than that of the protuberances. This, I think, is extremely\r\nprobable, though it has never yet been proved. Three stakes, placed, one\r\non the summit, another on the frontal slope, and another at the base of\r\na protuberance, would, I think, move with unequal velocities. They\r\nwould, I think, show that, upon the large and general motion of the\r\nglacier, smaller motions are superposed, as minor oscillations are known\r\nto cover parasitically the large ones of a vibrating string. Possibly,\r\nalso, the dirt-bands may owe something to the squeezing of impurities\r\nout of the glacier to its surface in the intervals between the\r\nswellings. From our present position we could also see the swellings on\r\nthe Viescherhoerner branch of the glacier, in the valleys between which\r\ncoarse shingle and debris were collected, which would form dirt-bands if\r\nthey could. On neither branch, however, do the bands attain the\r\ndefinition and beauty which they possess upon the Mer de Glace.\r\n\r\nAfter an instructive lesson we faced our task once more, passing amid\r\ncrags and boulders, and over steep moraines, from which the stones\r\nrolled down upon the slightest disturbance. While crossing a slope of\r\nsnow with an inclination of 45 deg., my footing gave way, I fell, but\r\nturned promptly on my face, dug my staff deeply into the snow, and\r\narrested the motion before I had slid a dozen yards. Ramsay was behind me,\r\nspeculating whether he should be able to pass the same point without\r\nslipping; before he reached it, however, the snow yielded, he fell, and\r\nslid swiftly downwards. Lauener, whose attention had been aroused by my\r\nfall, chanced to be looking round when Ramsay's footing yielded. With\r\nthe velocity of a projectile he threw himself upon my companion, seized\r\nhim, and brought him to rest before he had reached the bottom of the\r\nslope. The act made a very favourable impression upon me, it was so\r\nprompt and instinctive. An eagle could not swoop upon its prey with more\r\ndirectness of aim and swiftness of execution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ICE CLIFFS THROUGH THE FOG. 1858.]\r\n\r\nWhile this went on the clouds were playing hide and seek with the\r\nmountains. The ice-crags and pinnacles to our left, looming through the\r\nhaze, seemed of gigantic proportions, reminding one of the Hades of\r\nByron's 'Cain.'\r\n\r\n  \"How sunless and how vast are these dim realms!\"\r\n\r\nWe climbed for some time along the moraine which flanks the cascade, and\r\non reaching the level of the brow Lauener paused, cast off his knapsack,\r\nand declared for breakfast. While engaged with it the dense clouds which\r\nhad crammed the gorge and obscured the mountains, all melted away, and a\r\nscene of indescribable magnificence was revealed. Overhead the sky\r\nsuddenly deepened to dark blue, and against it the Finsteraarhorn\r\nprojected his dark and mighty mass. Brown spurs jutted from the\r\nmountain, and between them were precipitous snow-slopes, fluted by the\r\ndescent of rocks and avalanches, and broken into ice-precipices lower\r\ndown. Right in front of us, and from its proximity more gigantic to the\r\neye, was the Schreckhorn, while from couloirs and mountain-slopes the\r\nmatter of glaciers yet to be was poured into the vast basin on the rim\r\nof which we now stood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MUTATIONS OF THE CLOUDS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThis it was next our object to cross; our way lying in part through deep\r\nsnow-slush, the scene changing perpetually from blue heaven to gray haze\r\nwhich massed itself at intervals in dense clouds about the mountains.\r\nAfter crossing the basin our way lay partly over slopes of snow, partly\r\nover loose shingle, and at one place along the edge of a formidable\r\nprecipice of rock. We sat down sometimes to rest, and during these\r\npauses, though they were very brief, the scene had time to go through\r\nseveral of its Protean mutations. At one moment all would be perfectly\r\nserene, no cloud in the transparent air to tell us that any portion of\r\nit was in motion, while the blue heaven threw its flattened arch over\r\nthe magnificent amphitheatre. Then in an instant, from some local\r\ncauldron, the vapour would boil up suddenly, eddying wildly in the air,\r\nwhich a moment before seemed so still, and enveloping the entire scene.\r\nThus the space enclosed by the Finsteraarhorn, the Viescherhoerner, and\r\nthe Schreckhorn, would at one moment be filled with fog to the mountain\r\nheads, every trace of which a few minutes sufficed to sweep away,\r\nleaving the unstained blue of heaven behind it, and the mountains\r\nshowing sharp and jagged outlines in the glassy air. One might be almost\r\nled to imagine that the vapour molecules endured a strain similar to\r\nthat of water cooled below its freezing point, or heated beyond its\r\nboiling point; and that, on the strain being relieved by the sudden\r\nyielding of the opposing force, the particles rushed together, and thus\r\nfilled in an instant the clear atmosphere with aqueous precipitation.\r\n\r\nI had no idea that the Strahleck was so fine a pass. Whether it is the\r\nquality of my mind to take in the glory of the present so intensely as\r\nto make me forgetful of the glory of the past, I know not, but it\r\nappeared to me that I had never seen anything finer than the scene from\r\nthe summit. The amphitheatre formed by the mountains seemed to me of\r\nexceeding magnificence; nor do I think that my feeling was subjective\r\nmerely; for the simple magnitude of the masses which built up the\r\nspectacle would be sufficient to declare its grandeur. Looking down\r\ntowards the Glacier of the Aar, a scene of wild beauty and desolation\r\npresented itself. Not a trace of vegetation could be seen along the\r\nwhole range of the bounding mountains; glaciers streamed from their\r\nshoulders into the valley beneath, where they welded themselves to form\r\nthe Finsteraar affluent of the Unteraar glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESCENT OF THE CRAGS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nAfter a brief pause, Lauener again strapped on his knapsack, and\r\ntempered both will and muscles by the remark, that our worst piece of\r\nwork was now before us. From the place where we sat, the mountain fell\r\nprecipitously for several hundred feet; and down the weathered crags,\r\nand over the loose shingle which encumbered their ledges, our route now\r\nlay. Lauener was in front, cool and collected, lending at times a hand\r\nto Ramsay, and a word of encouragement to both of us, while I brought up\r\nthe rear. I found my full haversack so inconvenient that I once or twice\r\nthought of sending it down the crags in advance of me, but Lauener\r\nassured me that it would be utterly destroyed before reaching the\r\nbottom. My complaint against it was, that at critical places it\r\nsometimes came between me and the face of the cliff, pushing me away\r\nfrom the latter so as to throw my centre of gravity almost beyond the\r\nbase intended to support it. We came at length upon a snow-slope, which\r\nhad for a time an inclination of 50 deg.; then once more to the rocks;\r\nagain to the snow, which was both steep and deep. Our batons were at\r\nleast six feet long: we drove them into the snow to secure an anchorage,\r\nbut they sank to their very ends, and we merely retained a length of them\r\nsufficient for a grasp. This slope was intersected by a so-called\r\nBergschrund, the lower portion of the slope being torn away from its\r\nupper portion so as to form a crevasse that extended quite round the\r\nhead of the valley. We reached its upper edge; the chasm was partially\r\nfilled with snow, which brought its edges so near that we cleared it by\r\na jump. The rest of the slope was descended by a _glissade_. Each sat\r\ndown upon the snow, and the motion, once commenced, swiftly augmented to\r\nthe rate of an avalanche, and brought us pleasantly to the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THROUGH GLOOM TO THE GRIMSEL. 1858.]\r\n\r\nAs we looked from the heights, we could see that the valley through\r\nwhich our route lay was filled with gray fog: into this we soon plunged,\r\nand through it we made our way towards the Abschwung. The inclination of\r\nthe glacier was our only guide, for we could see nothing. Reaching the\r\nconfluence of the Finsteraar and Lauteraar branches, we went downwards\r\nwith long swinging strides, close alongside the medial moraine of the\r\ntrunk glacier. The glory of the morning had its check in the dull gloom\r\nof the evening. Across streams, amid dirt-cones and glacier-tables, and\r\nover the long reach of shingle which covers the end of the glacier, we\r\nplodded doggedly, and reached the Grimsel at 7 P.M., the journey having\r\ncost a little more than 14 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(15.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANCIENT GLACIER ACTION. 1858.]\r\n\r\nWe made the Grimsel our station for a day, which was spent in examining\r\nthe evidences of ancient glacier action in the valley of Hasli. Near the\r\nHospice, but at the opposite side of the Aar, rises a mountain-wall of\r\nhard granite, on which the flutings and groovings are magnificently\r\npreserved. After a little practice the eye can trace with the utmost\r\nprecision the line which marks the level of the ancient ice: above this\r\nthe crags are sharp and rugged; while below it the mighty grinder has\r\nrubbed off the pinnacles of the rocks and worn their edges away. The\r\nheight to which this action extends must be nearly two thousand feet\r\nabove the bed of the present valley. It is also easy to see the depth to\r\nwhich the river has worked its channel into the ancient rocks. In some\r\ncases the road from Guttanen to the Grimsel lay right over the polished\r\nrocks, asperities being supplied by the chisel of man in order to\r\nprevent travellers from slipping on their slopes. Here and there also\r\nhuge protuberant crags were rounded into domes almost as perfect as if\r\nchiselled by art. To both my companion and myself this walk was full of\r\ninstruction and delight.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July we crossed the Grimsel pass, and traced the\r\nscratchings to the very top of it. Ramsay remarked that their direction\r\nchanged high up the pass, as if a tributary from the summit had produced\r\nthem, while lower down they merged into the general direction of the\r\nglacier which had filled the principal valley. From the summit of the\r\nMayenwand we had a clear view of the glacier of the Rhone; and to see\r\nthe lower portion of this glacier to advantage no better position can be\r\nchosen. The dislocation of its cascade, the spreading out of the ice\r\nbelow, its system of radial crevasses, and the transverse sweep of its\r\nstructural groovings, may all be seen. A few hours afterwards we were\r\namong the wild chasms at the brow of the ice-fall, where we worked our\r\nway to the centre of the ice, but were unable to attain the opposite\r\nside.\r\n\r\nHaving examined the glacier both above and below the cascade, we went\r\ndown the valley to Viesch, and ascended thence, on the 30th of July, to\r\nthe Hotel Jungfrau on the slopes of the AEggischhorn. On the following\r\nday we climbed to the summit of the mountain, and from a sheltered nook\r\nenjoyed the glorious prospect which it commands. The wind was strong,\r\nand fleecy clouds flew over the heavens; some of which, as they formed\r\nand dispersed themselves about the flanks of the Aletschhorn, showed\r\nextraordinary iridescences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MAeRJELEN SEE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe sunbeams called us early on the morning of the 1st of August. No\r\ncloud rested on the opposite range of the Valais mountains, but on\r\nlooking towards the AEggischhorn we found a cap upon its crest; we looked\r\nagain--the cap had disappeared and a serene heaven stretched overhead.\r\nAs we breasted the alp the moon was still in the sky, paling more and\r\nmore before the advancing day; a single hawk swung in the atmosphere\r\nabove us; clear streams babbled from the hills, the louder sounds\r\nreposing on a base of music; while groups of cows with tinkling bells\r\nbrowsed upon the green alp. Here and there the grass was dispossessed,\r\nand the flanks of the mountain were covered by the blocks which had been\r\ncast down from the summit. On reaching the plateau at the base of the\r\nfinal pyramid, we rounded the mountain to the right and came over the\r\nlonely and beautiful Maerjelen See. No doubt the hollow which this lake\r\nfills had been scooped out in former ages by a branch of the Aletsch\r\nglacier; but long ago the blue ice gave place to blue water. The glacier\r\nbounds it at one side by a vertical wall of ice sixty feet in height:\r\nthis is incessantly undermined, a roof of crystal being formed over the\r\nwater, till at length the projecting mass, becoming too heavy for its\r\nown rigidity, breaks and tumbles into the lake. Here, attacked by sun\r\nand air, its blue surface is rendered dazzlingly white, and several\r\nicebergs of this kind now floated in the sunlight; the water was of a\r\nglassy smoothness, and in its blue depths each ice mass doubled itself\r\nby reflection.[A]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ALETSCH GLACIER. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe Aletsch is the grandest glacier in the Alps: over it we now stood,\r\nwhile the bounding mountains poured vast feeders into the noble stream.\r\nThe Jungfrau was in front of us without a cloud, and apparently so near\r\nthat I proposed to my guide to try it without further preparation. He\r\nwas enthusiastic at first, but caution afterwards got the better of his\r\ncourage. At some distance up the glacier the snow-line was distinctly\r\ndrawn, and from its edge upwards the mighty shoulders of the hills were\r\nheavy laden with the still powdery material of the glacier.\r\n\r\nAmid blocks and debris we descended to the ice: the portion of it which\r\nbounded the lake had been sapped, and a space of a foot existed between\r\nice and water: numerous chasms were formed here, the mass being thus\r\nbroken, preparatory to being sent adrift upon the lake. We crossed the\r\nglacier to its centre, and looking down it the grand peaks of the\r\nMischabel, the noble cone of the Weisshorn, and the dark and stern\r\nobelisk of the Matterhorn, formed a splendid picture. Looking upwards, a\r\nseries of most singularly contorted dirt-bands revealed themselves upon\r\nthe surface of the ice. I sought to trace them to their origin, but was\r\nfrustrated by the snow which overspread the upper portion of the\r\nglacier. Along this we marched for three hours, and came at length to\r\nthe junction of the four tributary valleys which pour their frozen\r\nstreams into the great trunk valley. The glory of the day, and that joy\r\nof heart which perfect health confers, may have contributed to produce\r\nthe impression, but I thought I had never seen anything to rival in\r\nmagnificence the region in the heart of which we now found ourselves. We\r\nclimbed the mountain on the right-hand side of the glacier, where,\r\nseated amid the riven and weather-worn crags, we fed our souls for hours\r\non the transcendent beauty of the scene.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A CHAMOIS DECEIVED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nWe afterwards redescended to the glacier, which at this place was\r\nintersected by large transverse crevasses, many of which were apparently\r\nfilled with snow, while over others a thin and treacherous roof was\r\nthrown. In some cases the roof had broken away, and revealed rows of\r\nicicles of great length and transparency pendent from the edges. We at\r\nlength turned our faces homewards, and looking down the glacier I saw\r\nat a great distance something moving on the ice. I first thought it was\r\na man, though it seemed strange that a man should be there alone. On\r\ndrawing my guide's attention to it he at once pronounced it to be a\r\nchamois, and I with my telescope immediately verified his statement. The\r\ncreature bounded up the glacier at intervals, and sometimes the vigour\r\nof its spring showed that it had projected itself over a crevasse. It\r\napproached us sometimes at full gallop: then would stop, look toward us,\r\npipe loudly, and commence its race once more. It evidently made the\r\nreciprocal mistake to my own, imagining us to be of its own kith and\r\nkin. We sat down upon the ice the better to conceal our forms, and to\r\nits whistle our guide whistled in reply. A joyous rush was the\r\ncreature's first response to the signal; but it afterwards began to\r\ndoubt, and its pauses became more frequent. Its form at times was\r\nextremely graceful, the head erect in the air, its apparent uprightness\r\nbeing augmented by the curvature which threw its horns back. I watched\r\nthe animal through my glass until I could see the glistening of its\r\neyes; but soon afterwards it made a final pause, assured itself of its\r\nerror, and flew with the speed of the wind to its refuge in the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] A painting of this exquisite lake has been recently executed by Mr.\r\nGeorge Barnard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASCENT OF THE FINSTERAARHORN, 1858.\r\n\r\n(16.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MY GUIDE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nSince my arrival at the hotel on the 30th of July I had once or twice\r\nspoken about ascending the Finsteraarhorn, and on the 2nd of August my\r\nhost advised me to avail myself of the promising weather. A guide, named\r\nBennen, was attached to the hotel, a remarkable-looking man, between 30\r\nand 40 years old, of middle stature, but very strongly built. His\r\ncountenance was frank and firm, while a light of good-nature at times\r\ntwinkled in his eye. Altogether the man gave me the impression of\r\nphysical strength, combined with decision of character. The proprietor\r\nhad spoken to me many times of the strength and courage of this man,\r\nwinding up his praises of him by the assurance that if I were killed in\r\nBennen's company there would be two lives lost, for that the guide would\r\nassuredly sacrifice himself in the effort to save his _Herr_.\r\n\r\nHe was called, and I asked him whether he would accompany me alone to\r\nthe top of the Finsteraarhorn. To this he at first objected, urging the\r\npossibility of his having to render me assistance, and the great amount\r\nof labour which this might entail upon him; but this was overruled by my\r\nengaging to follow where he led, without asking him to render me any\r\nhelp whatever. He then agreed to make the trial, stipulating, however,\r\nthat he should not have much to carry to the cave of the Faulberg, where\r\nwe were to spend the night. To this I cordially agreed, and sent on\r\nblankets, provisions, wood, and hay, by two porters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IRIDESCENT CLOUD. 1858.]\r\n\r\nMy desire, in part, was to make a series of observations at the summit\r\nof the mountain, while a similar series was made by Professor Ramsay in\r\nthe valley of the Rhone, near Viesch, with a view to ascertaining the\r\npermeability of the lower strata of the atmosphere to the radiant heat\r\nof the sun. During the forenoon of the 2nd I occupied myself with my\r\ninstruments, and made the proper arrangements with Ramsay. I tested a\r\nmountain-thermometer which Mr. Casella had kindly lent me, and found the\r\nboiling point of water on the dining-room table of the hotel to be\r\n199.29 deg. Fahrenheit. At about three o'clock in the afternoon we quitted\r\nthe hotel, and proceeded leisurely with our two guides up the slope of\r\nthe AEggischhorn. We once caught a sight of the topmost pinnacle of the\r\nFinsteraarhorn; beside it was the Rothhorn, and near this again the\r\nOberaarhorn, with the Viescher glacier streaming from its shoulders. On\r\nthe opposite side we could see, over an oblique buttress of the mountain\r\non which we stood, the snowy summit of the Weisshorn; to the left of\r\nthis was the ever grim and lonely Matterhorn; and farther to the left,\r\nwith its numerous snow-cones, each with its attendant shadow, rose the\r\nmighty Mischabel. We descended, and crossed the stream which flows from\r\nthe Maerjelen See, into which a large mass of the glacier had recently\r\nfallen, and was now afloat as an iceberg. We passed along the margin of\r\nthe lake, and at the junction of water and ice I bade Ramsay good-bye.\r\nAt the commencement of our journey upon the ice, whenever we crossed a\r\ncrevasse, I noticed Bennen watching me; his vigilance, however, soon\r\ndiminished, whence I gathered that he finally concluded that I was able\r\nto take care of myself. Clouds hovered in the atmosphere throughout the\r\nwhole time of our ascent; one smoky-looking mass marred the glory of the\r\nsunset, but at some distance was another which exhibited colours almost\r\nas rich and varied as those of the solar spectrum. I took the glorious\r\nbanner thus unfurled as a sign of hope, to check the despondency which\r\nits gloomy neighbour was calculated to produce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EVENING NEAR THE JUNGFRAU. 1858.]\r\n\r\nTwo hours' walking brought us near our place of rest; the porters had\r\nalready reached it, and were now returning. We deviated to the right,\r\nand, having crossed some ice-ravines, reached the lateral moraine of the\r\nglacier, and picked our way between it and the adjacent mountain-wall.\r\nWe then reached a kind of amphitheatre, crossed it, and climbing the\r\nopposite slope, came to a triple grotto formed by clefts in the\r\nmountain. In one of these a pine-fire was soon blazing briskly, and\r\ncasting its red light upon the surrounding objects, though but half\r\ndispelling the gloom from the deeper portions of the cell. I left the\r\ngrotto, and climbed the rocks above it to look at the heavens. The sun\r\nhad quitted our firmament, but still tinted the clouds with red and\r\npurple; while one peak of snow in particular glowed like fire, so vivid\r\nwas its illumination. During our journey upwards the Jungfrau never once\r\nshowed her head, but, as if in ill temper, had wrapped her vapoury veil\r\naround her. She now looked more good-humoured, but still she did not\r\nquite remove her hood; though all the other summits, without a trace of\r\ncloud to mask their beautiful forms, pointed heavenward. The calmness\r\nwas perfect; no sound of living creature, no whisper of a breeze, no\r\ngurgle of water, no rustle of debris, to break the deep and solemn\r\nsilence. Surely, if beauty be an object of worship, those glorious\r\nmountains, with rounded shoulders of the purest white--snow-crested and\r\nstar-gemmed--were well calculated to excite sentiments of adoration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CAVE OF THE FAULBERG. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI returned to the grotto, where supper was prepared and waiting for me.\r\nThe boiling point of water, at the level of the \"kitchen\" floor, I found\r\nto be 196 deg. Fahr. Nothing could be more picturesque than the aspect of\r\nthe cave before we went to rest. The fire was gleaming ruddily. I sat\r\nupon a stone bench beside it, while Bennen was in front with the red\r\nlight glimmering fitfully over him. My boiling-water apparatus, which\r\nhad just been used, was in the foreground; and telescopes,\r\nopera-glasses, haversacks, wine-keg, bottles, and mattocks, lay\r\nconfusedly around. The heavens continued to grow clearer, the thin\r\nclouds, which had partially overspread the sky, melting gradually away.\r\nThe grotto was comfortable; the hay sufficient materially to modify the\r\nhardness of the rock, and my position at least sheltered and warm. One\r\npossibility remained that might prevent me from sleeping--the snoring of\r\nmy companion; he assured me, however, that he did not snore, and we lay\r\ndown side by side. The good fellow took care that I should not be\r\nchilled; he gave me the best place, by far the best part of the clothes,\r\nand may have suffered himself in consequence; but, happily for him, he\r\nwas soon oblivious of this. Physiologists, I believe, have discovered\r\nthat it is chiefly during sleep that the muscles are repaired; and ere\r\nlong the sound I dreaded announced to me at once the repair of Bennen's\r\nmuscles and the doom of my own. The hollow cave resounded to the\r\ndeep-drawn snore. I once or twice stirred the sleeper, breaking thereby\r\nthe continuity of the phenomenon; but it instantly pieced itself\r\ntogether again, and went on as before. I had not the heart to wake him,\r\nfor I knew that upon him would devolve the chief labour of the coming\r\nday. At half-past one he rose and prepared coffee, and at two o'clock I\r\nwas engaged upon the beverage. We afterwards packed up our provisions\r\nand instruments. Bennen bore the former, I the latter, and at three\r\no'clock we set out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"SHALL WE TRY THE JUNGFRAU?\" 1858.]\r\n\r\nWe first descended a steep slope to the glacier, along which we walked\r\nfor a time. A spur of the Faulberg jutted out between us and the\r\nice-laden valley through which we must pass; this we crossed in order to\r\nshorten our way and to avoid crevasses. Loose shingle and boulders\r\noverlaid the mountain; and here and there walls of rock opposed our\r\nprogress, and rendered the route far from agreeable. We then descended\r\nto the Gruenhorn tributary, which joins the trunk glacier at nearly a\r\nright angle, being terminated by a saddle which stretches across from\r\nmountain to mountain, with a curvature as graceful and as perfect as if\r\ndrawn by the instrument of a mathematician. The unclouded moon was\r\nshining, and the Jungfrau was before us so pure and beautiful, that the\r\nthought of visiting the \"Maiden\" without further preparation occurred to\r\nme. I turned to Bennen, and said, \"Shall we try the Jungfrau?\" I think\r\nhe liked the idea well enough, though he cautiously avoided incurring\r\nany responsibility. \"If you desire it, I am ready,\" was his reply. He\r\nhad never made the ascent, and nobody knew anything of the state of the\r\nsnow this year; but Lauener had examined it through a telescope on the\r\nprevious day, and pronounced it dangerous. In every ascent of the\r\nmountain hitherto made, ladders had been found indispensable, but we had\r\nnone. I questioned Bennen as to what he thought of the probabilities,\r\nand tried to extract some direct encouragement from him; but he said\r\nthat the decision rested altogether with myself, and it was his business\r\nto endeavour to carry out that decision. \"We will attempt it, then,\" I\r\nsaid, and for some time we actually walked towards the Jungfrau. A gray\r\ncloud drew itself across her summit, and clung there. I asked myself why\r\nI deviated from my original intention? The Finsteraarhorn was higher,\r\nand therefore better suited for the contemplated observations. I could\r\nin no wise justify the change, and finally expressed my scruples. A\r\nmoment's further conversation caused us to \"right about,\" and front the\r\nsaddle of the Gruenhorn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAGNIFICENT SCENE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe dawn advanced. The eastern sky became illuminated and warm, and high\r\nin the air across the ridge in front of us stretched a tongue of cloud\r\nlike a red flame, and equally fervid in its hue. Looking across the\r\ntrunk glacier, a valley which is terminated by the Loetsch saddle was\r\nseen in a straight line with our route, and I often turned to look along\r\nthis magnificent corridor. The mightiest mountains in the Oberland form\r\nits sides; still, the impression which it makes is not that of vastness\r\nor sublimity, but of loveliness not to be described. The sun had not yet\r\nsmitten the snows of the bounding mountains, but the saddle carved out a\r\nsegment of the heavens which formed a background of unspeakable beauty.\r\nOver the rim of the saddle the sky was deep orange, passing upwards\r\nthrough amber, yellow, and vague ethereal green to the ordinary\r\nfirmamental blue. Right above the snow-curve purple clouds hung\r\nperfectly motionless, giving depth to the spaces between them. There was\r\nsomething saintly in the scene. Anything more exquisite I had never\r\nbeheld.\r\n\r\nWe marched upwards over the smooth crisp snow to the crest of the\r\nsaddle, and here I turned to take a last look along that grand corridor,\r\nand at that wonderful \"daffodil sky.\" The sun's rays had already smitten\r\nthe snows of the Aletschhorn; the radiance seemed to infuse a principle\r\nof life and activity into the mountains and glaciers, but still that\r\nholy light shone forth, and those motionless clouds floated beyond,\r\nreminding one of that eastern religion whose essence is the repression\r\nof all action and the substitution for it of immortal calm. The\r\nFinsteraarhorn now fronted us; but clouds turbaned the head of the\r\ngiant, and hid it from our view. The wind, however, being north,\r\ninspired us with a strong hope that they would melt as the day advanced.\r\nI have hardly seen a finer ice-field than that which now lay before us.\r\nConsidering the _neve_ which supplies it, it appeared to me that the\r\nViescher glacier ought to discharge as much ice as the Aletsch; but this\r\nis an error due to the extent of _neve_ which is here at once visible:\r\nsince a glance at the map of this portion of the Oberland shows at once\r\nthe great superiority of the mountain treasury from which the Aletsch\r\nglacier draws support. Still, the ice-field before us was a most noble\r\none. The surrounding mountains were of imposing magnitude, and loaded to\r\ntheir summits with snow. Down the sides of some of them the\r\nhalf-consolidated mass fell in a state of wild fracture and confusion.\r\nIn some cases the riven masses were twisted and overturned, the ledges\r\nbent, and the detached blocks piled one upon another in heaps; while in\r\nother cases the smooth white mass descended from crown to base without a\r\nwrinkle. The valley now below us was gorged by the frozen material thus\r\nincessantly poured into it. We crossed it, and reached the base of the\r\nFinsteraarhorn, ascended the mountain a little way, and at six o'clock\r\npaused to lighten our burdens and to refresh ourselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MOUNTAIN ASSAILED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe north wind had freshened, we were in the shade, and the cold was\r\nvery keen. Placing a bottle of tea and a small quantity of provisions in\r\nthe knapsack, and a few figs and dried prunes in our pockets, we\r\ncommenced the ascent. The Finsteraarhorn sends down a number of cliffy\r\nbuttresses, separated from each other by wide couloirs filled with ice\r\nand snow. We ascended one of these buttresses for a time, treading\r\ncautiously among the spiky rocks; afterwards we went along the snow at\r\nthe edge of the spine, and then fairly parted company with the rock,\r\nabandoning ourselves to the _neve_ of the couloir. The latter was steep,\r\nand the snow was so firm that steps had to be cut in it. Once I paused\r\nupon a little ledge, which gave me a slight footing, and took the\r\ninclination. The slope formed an angle of 45 deg. with the horizon; and\r\nacross it, at a little distance below me, a gloomy fissure opened its\r\njaws. The sun now cleared the summits which had before cut off his rays,\r\nand burst upon us with great power, compelling us to resort to our\r\nveils and dark spectacles. Two years before, Bennen had been nearly\r\nblinded by inflammation brought on by the glare from the snow, and he\r\nnow took unusual care in protecting his eyes. The rocks looking more\r\npracticable, we again made towards them, and clambered among them till a\r\nvertical precipice, which proved impossible of ascent, fronted us.\r\nBennen scanned the obstacle closely as we slowly approached it, and\r\nfinally descended to the snow, which wound at a steep angle round its\r\nbase: on this the footing appeared to me to be singularly insecure, but\r\nI marched without hesitation or anxiety in the footsteps of my guide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CREST OF ROCKS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nWe ascended the rocks once more, continued along them for some time, and\r\nthen deviated to the couloir on our left. This snow-slope is much\r\ndislocated at its lower portion, and above its precipices and crevasses\r\nour route now lay. The snow was smooth, and sufficiently firm and steep\r\nto render the cutting of steps necessary. Bennen took the lead: to make\r\neach step he swung his mattock once, and his hindmost foot rose exactly\r\nat the moment the mattock descended; there was thus a kind of rhythm in\r\nhis motion, the raising of the foot keeping time to the swing of the\r\nimplement. In this manner we proceeded till we reached the base of the\r\nrocky pyramid which caps the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SUMMIT GAINED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOne side of the pyramid had been sliced off, thus dropping down almost a\r\nsheer precipice for some thousands of feet to the Finsteraar glacier. A\r\nwall of rock, about 10 or 15 feet high, runs along the edge of the\r\nmountain, and this sheltered us from the north wind, which surged with\r\nthe sound of waves against the tremendous barrier at the other side.\r\n\"Our hardest work is now before us,\" said my guide. Our way lay up the\r\nsteep and splintered rocks, among which we sought out the spikes which\r\nwere closely enough wedged to bear our weight. Each had to trust to\r\nhimself, and I fulfilled to the letter my engagement with Bennen to ask\r\nno help. My boiling-water apparatus and telescope were on my back, much\r\nto my annoyance, as the former was heavy, and sometimes swung awkwardly\r\nround as I twisted myself among the cliffs. Bennen offered to take it,\r\nbut he had his own share to carry, and I was resolved to bear mine.\r\nSometimes the rocks alternated with spaces of ice and snow, which we\r\nwere at intervals compelled to cross; sometimes, when the slope was pure\r\nice and very steep, we were compelled to retreat to the highest cliffs.\r\nThe wall to which I have referred had given way in some places, and\r\nthrough the gaps thus formed the wind rushed with a loud, wild, wailing\r\nsound. Through these spaces I could see the entire field of Agassiz's\r\nobservations; the junction of the Lauteraar and Finsteraar glaciers at\r\nthe Abschwung, the medial moraine between them, on which stood the Hotel\r\ndes Neufchatelois, and the pavilion built by M. Dollfuss, in which\r\nHuxley and myself had found shelter two years before. Bennen was\r\nevidently anxious to reach the summit, and recommended all observations\r\nto be postponed until after our success had been assured. I agreed to\r\nthis, and kept close at his heels. Strong as he was, he sometimes\r\npaused, laid his head upon his mattock, and panted like a chased deer.\r\nHe complained of fearful thirst, and to quench it we had only my bottle\r\nof tea: this we shared loyally, my guide praising its virtues, as well\r\nhe might. Still the summit loomed above us; still the angry swell of the\r\nnorth wind, beating against the torn battlements of the mountain, made\r\nwild music. Upward, however, we strained; and at last, on gaining the\r\ncrest of a rock, Bennen exclaimed, in a jubilant voice, \"_Die hoechste\r\nSpitze!_\"--the highest point. In a moment I was at his side, and saw the\r\nsummit within a few paces of us. A minute or two placed us upon the\r\ntopmost-pinnacle, with the blue dome of heaven above us, and a world of\r\nmountains, clouds, and glaciers beneath.\r\n\r\nA notion is entertained by many of the guides that if you go to sleep at\r\nthe summit of any of the highest mountains, you will\r\n\r\n  \"Sleep the sleep that knows no waking.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THERMOMETER PLACED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nBennen did not appear to entertain this superstition; and before\r\nstarting in the morning, I had stipulated for ten minutes' sleep on\r\nreaching the summit, as part compensation for the loss of the night's\r\nrest. My first act, after casting a glance over the glorious scene\r\nbeneath us, was to take advantage of this agreement; so I lay down and\r\nhad five minutes' sleep, from which I rose refreshed and brisk. The sun\r\nat first beat down upon us with intense force, and I exposed my\r\nthermometers; but thin veils of vapour soon drew themselves before the\r\nsun, and denser mists spread over the valley of the Rhone, thus\r\ndestroying all possibility of concert between Ramsay and myself. I\r\nturned therefore to my boiling-water apparatus, filled it with snow,\r\nmelted the first charge, put more in, and boiled it; ascertaining the\r\nboiling point to be 187 deg. Fahrenheit. On a sheltered ledge, about two or\r\nthree yards south of the highest point, I placed a minimum-thermometer,\r\nin the hope that it would enable us in future years to record the lowest\r\nwinter temperatures at the summit of the mountain.[A]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCENE FROM THE SUMMIT. 1858.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey any just impression of the scene from the\r\nsummit of the Finsteraarhorn: one might, it is true, arrange the visible\r\nmountains in a list, stating their heights and distances, and leaving\r\nthe imagination to furnish them with peaks and pinnacles, to build the\r\nprecipices, polish the snow, rend the glaciers, and cap the highest\r\nsummits with appropriate clouds. But if imagination did its best in this\r\nway, it would hardly exceed the reality, and would certainly omit many\r\ndetails which contribute to the grandeur of the scene itself. The\r\nvarious shapes of the mountains, some grand, some beautiful, bathed in\r\nyellow sunshine, or lying black and riven under the frown of impervious\r\ncumuli; the pure white peaks, cornices, bosses, and amphitheatres; the\r\nblue ice rifts, the stratified snow-precipices, the glaciers issuing\r\nfrom the hollows of the eternal hills, and stretching like frozen\r\nserpents through the sinuous valleys; the lower cloud field--itself an\r\nempire of vaporous hills--shining with dazzling whiteness, while here\r\nand there grim summits, brown by nature, and black by contrast, pierce\r\nthrough it like volcanic islands through a shining sea,--add to this the\r\nconsciousness of one's position which clings to one _unconsciously_,\r\nthat undercurrent of emotion which surrounds the question of one's\r\npersonal safety, at a height of more than 14,000 feet above the sea, and\r\nwhich is increased by the weird strange sound of the wind surging with\r\nthe full deep boom of the distant sea against the precipice behind, or\r\nrising to higher cadences as it forces itself through the crannies of\r\nthe weatherworn rocks,--all conspire to render the scene from the\r\nFinsteraarhorn worthy of the monarch of the Bernese Alps.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"HAVE NO FEAR.\" 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISCIPLINE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nMy guide at length warned me that we must be moving; repeating the\r\nwarning more impressively before I attended to it. We packed up, and as\r\nwe stood beside each other ready to march he asked me whether we should\r\ntie ourselves together, at the same time expressing his belief that it\r\nwas unnecessary. Up to this time we had been separate, and the thought\r\nof attaching ourselves had not occurred to me till he mentioned it. I\r\nthought it, however, prudent to accept the suggestion, and so we united\r\nour destinies by a strong rope. \"Now,\" said Bennen, \"have no fear; no\r\nmatter how you throw yourself, I will hold you.\" Afterwards, on another\r\nperilous summit, I repeated this saying of Bennen's to a strong and\r\nactive guide, but his observation was that it was a hardy untruth, for\r\nthat in many places Bennen could not have held me. Nevertheless a daring\r\nword strengthens the heart, and, though I felt no trace of that\r\nsentiment which Bennen exhorted me to banish, and was determined, as far\r\nas in me lay, to give him no opportunity of trying his strength in\r\nsaving me, I liked the fearless utterance of the man, and sprang\r\ncheerily after him. Our descent was rapid, apparently reckless, amid\r\nloose spikes, boulders, and vertical prisms of rock, where a false step\r\nwould assuredly have been attended with broken bones; but the\r\nconsciousness of certainty in our movements never forsook us, and proved\r\na source of keen enjoyment. The senses were all awake, the eye clear,\r\nthe heart strong, the limbs steady, yet flexible, with power of recovery\r\nin store, and ready for instant action should the footing give way. Such\r\nis the discipline which a perilous ascent imposes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESCENT BY GLISSADES. 1858.]\r\n\r\nWe finally quitted the crest of rocks, and got fairly upon the snow once\r\nmore. We first went downwards at a long swinging trot. The sun having\r\nmelted the crust which we were compelled to cut through in the morning,\r\nthe leg at each plunge sank deeply into the snow; but this sinking was\r\npartly in the direction of the slope of the mountain, and hence assisted\r\nour progress. Sometimes the crust was hard enough to enable us to glide\r\nupon it for long distances while standing erect; but the end of these\r\n_glissades_ was always a plunge and tumble in the deeper snow. Once upon\r\na steep hard slope Bennen's footing gave way; he fell, and went down\r\nrapidly, pulling me after him. I fell also, but turning quickly, drove\r\nthe spike of my hatchet into the ice, got good anchorage, and held both\r\nfast; my success assuring me that I had improved as a mountaineer since\r\nmy ascent of Mont Blanc. We tumbled so often in the soft snow, and our\r\nclothes and boots were so full of it, that we thought we might as well\r\ntry the sitting posture in gliding down. We did so, and descended with\r\nextraordinary velocity, being checked at intervals by a bodily immersion\r\nin the softer and deeper snow. I was usually in front of Bennen,\r\nshooting down with the speed of an arrow and feeling the check of the\r\nrope when the rapidity of my motion exceeded my guide's estimate of\r\nwhat was safe. Sometimes I was behind him, and darted at intervals with\r\nthe swiftness of an avalanche right upon him; sometimes in the same\r\ntransverse line with him, with the full length of the rope between us;\r\nand here I found its check unpleasant, as it tended to make me roll\r\nover. My feet were usually in the air, and it was only necessary to turn\r\nthem right or left, like the helm of a boat, to change the direction of\r\nmotion and avoid a difficulty, while a vigorous dig of leg and hatchet\r\ninto the snow was sufficient to check the motion and bring us to rest.\r\nSwiftly, yet cautiously, we glided into the region of crevasses, where\r\nwe at last rose, quite wet, and resumed our walking, until we reached\r\nthe point where we had left our wine in the morning, and where I\r\nsqueezed the water from my wet clothes, and partially dried them in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE VIESCH GLACIER. 1858.]\r\n\r\nWe had left some things at the cave of the Faulberg, and it was Bennen's\r\nfirst intention to return that way and take them home with him. Finding,\r\nhowever, that we could traverse the Viescher glacier almost to the\r\nAEggischhorn, I made this our highway homewards. At the place where we\r\nentered it, and for an hour or two afterwards, the glacier was cut by\r\nfissures, for the most part covered with snow. We had packed up our\r\nrope, and Bennen admonished me to tread in his steps. Three or four\r\ntimes he half disappeared in the concealed fissures, but by clutching\r\nthe snow he rescued himself and went on as swiftly as before. Once my\r\nleg sank, and the ring of icicles some fifty feet below told me that I\r\nwas in the jaws of a crevasse; my guide turned sharply--it was the only\r\ntime that I had seen concern on his countenance:--\r\n\r\n\"_Gott's Donner! Sie haben meine Tritte nicht gefolgt._\"\r\n\r\n\"_Doch!_\" was my only reply, and we went on. He scarcely tried the snow\r\nthat he crossed, as from its form and colour he could in most cases\r\njudge of its condition. For a long time we kept at the left-hand side of\r\nthe glacier, avoiding the fissures which were now permanently open. We\r\ncame upon the tracks of a herd of chamois, which had clambered from the\r\nglacier up the sides of the Oberaarhorn, and afterwards crossed the\r\nglacier to the right-hand side, my guide being perfect master of the\r\nground. His eyes went in advance of his steps, and his judgment was\r\nformed before his legs moved. The glacier was deeply fissured, but there\r\nwas no swerving, no retreating, no turning back to seek more practicable\r\nroutes; each stride told, and every stroke of the axe was a profitable\r\ninvestment of labour.\r\n\r\nWe left the glacier for a time, and proceeded along the mountain side,\r\ntill we came near the end of the Trift glacier, where we let ourselves\r\ndown an awkward face of rock along the track of a little cascade, and\r\ncame upon the glacier once more. Here again I had occasion to admire the\r\nknowledge and promptness of my guide. The glacier, as is well known, is\r\ngreatly dislocated, and has once or twice proved a prison to guides and\r\ntravellers, but Bennen led me through the confusion without a pause. We\r\nwere sometimes in the middle of the glacier, sometimes on the moraine,\r\nand sometimes on the side of the flanking mountain. Towards the end of\r\nthe day we crossed what seemed to be the consolidated remains of a great\r\navalanche; on this my foot slipped, there was a crevasse at hand, and a\r\nsudden effort was necessary to save me from falling into it. In making\r\nthis effort the spike of my axe turned uppermost, and the palm of my\r\nhand came down upon it, thus receiving a very ugly wound. We were soon\r\nupon the green alp, having bidden a last farewell to the ice. Another\r\nhour's hard walking brought us to our hotel. No one seeing us crossing\r\nthe alp would have supposed that we had laid such a day's work behind\r\nus; the proximity of home gave vigour to our strides, and our progress\r\nwas much more speedy than it had been on starting in the morning. I was\r\naffectionately welcomed by Ramsay, had a warm bath, dined, went to bed,\r\nwhere I lay fast locked in sleep for eight hours, and rose next morning\r\nas fresh and vigorous as if I had never scaled the Finsteraarhorn.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The following note describes the single observation made with this\r\nthermometer. Mr. B. informs me that on finding the instrument Bennen\r\nswung it in triumph round his head. I fear, therefore, that the\r\nobservation gives us no certain information regarding the minimum\r\nwinter-temperature.\r\n\r\n                                        \"St. Nicholas, 1859, Aug. 25.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,--On Tuesday last (the 23rd inst.) a party, consisting of Messrs.\r\nB., H., R. L., and myself, succeeded in reaching the summit of the\r\nFinsteraarhorn under the guidance of Bennen and Melchior Anderegg. We\r\nmade it an especial object to observe and reset the minimum-thermometer\r\nwhich you left there last year. On reaching the summit, before I had\r\ntime to stop him, Bennen produced the instrument, and it is just\r\npossible that in moving it he may have altered the position of the\r\nindex. However, as he held the instrument horizontally, and did not, as\r\nfar as I saw, give it any sensible jerk, I have great confidence that\r\nthe index remained unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"The reading of the index was -32 deg. Cent.\r\n\r\n\"A portion of the spirit extending over about 10-1/2 deg. (and standing\r\ntween 33 deg. and 43-1/2 deg.) was separated from the rest, but there\r\nappeared to be no data for determining when the separation had taken place.\r\nAs it appeared desirable to unite the two portions of spirit before again\r\nsetting the index to record the cold of another winter, we endeavoured\r\nto effect this by heating the bulb, but unfortunately, just as we were\r\nexpecting to see them coalesce, the bulb burst, and I have now to\r\nexpress my great regret that my clumsiness or ignorance of the proper\r\nmode of setting the instrument in order should have interfered with the\r\ncontinuance of observations of so much interest. The remains of the\r\ninstrument, together with a note of the accident, I have left in the\r\ncharge of Wellig, the landlord of the hotel on the AEggischhorn.\r\n\r\n\"We reached the summit about 10.40 A.M. and remained there till noon;\r\nthe reading of a pocket thermometer in the shade was 41 deg. F.\r\n\r\n\"Should there be any further details connected with our ascent on which\r\nyou would like to have information, I shall be happy to supply them to\r\nthe best of my recollection. Meanwhile, with a farther apology for my\r\nclumsiness, I beg to subscribe myself yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                        \"H.\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor Tyndall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(17.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A ROTATING ICEBERG. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of August there was a long fight between mist and sunshine,\r\neach triumphing by turns, till at length the orb gained the victory and\r\ncleansed the mountains from every trace of fog. We descended to the\r\nMaerjelen See, and, wishing to try the floating power of its icebergs, at\r\na place where masses sufficiently large approached near to the shore, I\r\nput aside a portion of my clothes, and retaining my boots stepped upon\r\nthe floating ice. It bore me for a time, and I hoped eventually to be\r\nable to paddle myself over the water. On swerving a little, however,\r\nfrom the position in which I first stood, the mass turned over and let\r\nme into the lake. I tried a second one, which served me in the same\r\nmanner; the water was too cold to continue the attempt, and there was\r\nalso some risk of being unpleasantly ground between the opposing\r\nsurfaces of the masses of ice. A very large iceberg which had been\r\ndetached some short time previously from the glacier lay floating at\r\nsome distance from us. Suddenly a sound like that of a waterfall drew\r\nour attention towards it. We saw it roll over with the utmost\r\ndeliberation, while the water which it carried along with it rushed in\r\ncataracts down its sides. Its previous surface was white, its present\r\none was of a lovely blue, the submerged crystal having now come to the\r\nair. The summerset of this iceberg produced a commotion all over the\r\nlake; the floating masses at its edge clashed together, and a mellow\r\nglucking sound, due to the lapping of the undulations against the frozen\r\nmasses, continued long afterwards.\r\n\r\nWe subsequently spent several hours upon the glacier; and on this day I\r\nnoticed for the first time a contemporaneous exhibition of _bedding_ and\r\n_structure_ to which I shall refer at another place. We passed finally\r\nto the left bank of the glacier, at some distance below the base of the\r\nAEggischhorn, and traced its old moraines at intervals along the flanks\r\nof the bounding mountain. At the summit of the ridge we found several\r\nfine old _roches moutonnees_, on some of which the scratchings of a\r\nglacier long departed were well preserved; and from the direction of the\r\nscratchings it might be inferred that the ice moved down the mountain\r\ntowards the valley of the Rhone. A plunge into a lonely mountain lake\r\nended the day's excursion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: END OF THE ALETSCH GLACIER. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August we quitted this noble station. Sending our guide on\r\nto Viesch to take a conveyance and proceed with our luggage down the\r\nvalley, Ramsay and myself crossed the mountains obliquely, desiring to\r\ntrace the glacier to its termination. We had no path, but it was hardly\r\npossible to go astray. We crossed spurs, climbed and descended pleasant\r\nmounds, sometimes with the soft grass under our feet, and sometimes\r\nknee-deep in rhododendrons. It took us several hours to reach the end of\r\nthe glacier, and we then looked down upon it merely. It lay couched like\r\na reptile in a wild gorge, as if it had split the mountain by its frozen\r\nsnout. We afterwards descended to Moerill, where we met our guide and\r\ndriver; thence down the valley to Visp; and the following evening saw us\r\nlodged at the Monte Rosa hotel in Zermatt.\r\n\r\nThe boiling point of water on the table of the _salle a manger_, I found\r\nto be 202.58 deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEADOWS INVADED BY ICE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I proceeded without my friend to the Goerner\r\nglacier. As is well known, the end of this glacier has been steadily\r\nadvancing for several years, and when I saw it, the meadow in front of\r\nit was partly shrivelled up by its irresistible advance. I was informed\r\nby my host that within the last sixty years forty-four chalets had been\r\noverturned by the glacier, the ground on which they stood being occupied\r\nby the ice; at present there are others for which a similar fate seems\r\nimminent. In thus advancing the glacier merely takes up ground which\r\nbelonged to it in former ages, for the rounded rocks which rise out of\r\nthe adjacent meadow show that it once passed over them.\r\n\r\nI had arranged to meet Ramsay this morning on the road to the\r\nRiffelberg. The meeting took place, but I then learned that a minute or\r\ntwo after my departure he had received intelligence of the death of a\r\nnear relative. Thus was our joint expedition terminated, for he resolved\r\nto return at once to England. At my solicitation he accompanied me to\r\nthe Riffel hotel. We had planned an ascent of Monte Rosa together, but\r\nthe arrangement thus broke down, and I was consequently thrown upon my\r\nown resources. Lauener had never made the ascent, but he nevertheless\r\nfelt confident that we should accomplish it together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ASCENT OF MONTE ROSA, 1858.\r\n\r\n(18.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE RIFFELBERG. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOUNDS ON THE GLACIER. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 9th of August, we reached the Riffel, and, by good\r\nfortune, on the evening of the same day, my guide's brother, the\r\nwell-known Ulrich Lauener, also arrived at the hotel on his return from\r\nMonte Rosa. From him we obtained all the information possible respecting\r\nthe ascent, and he kindly agreed to accompany us a little way the next\r\nmorning, to put us on the right track. At three A.M. the door of my\r\nbedroom opened, and Christian Lauener announced to me that the weather\r\nwas sufficiently good to justify an attempt. The stars were shining\r\noverhead; but Ulrich afterwards drew our attention to some heavy clouds\r\nwhich clung to the mountains on the other side of the valley of the\r\nVisp; remarking that the weather _might_ continue fair throughout the\r\nday, but that these clouds were ominous. At four o'clock we were on our\r\nway, by which time a gray stratus cloud had drawn itself across the neck\r\nof the Matterhorn, and soon afterwards another of the same nature\r\nencircled his waist. We proceeded past the Riffelhorn to the ridge above\r\nthe Goerner glacier, from which Monte Rosa was visible from top to\r\nbottom, and where an animated conversation in Swiss patois commenced.\r\nUlrich described the slopes, passes, and precipices, which were to guide\r\nus; and Christian demanded explanations, until he was finally able to\r\ndeclare to me that his knowledge was sufficient. We then bade Ulrich\r\ngood-bye, and went forward. All was clear about Monte Rosa, and the\r\nyellow morning light shone brightly upon its uppermost snows. Beside the\r\nQueen of the Alps was the huge mass of the Lyskamm, with a saddle\r\nstretching from the one to the other; next to the Lyskamm came two\r\nwhite rounded mounds, smooth and pure, the Twins Castor and Pollux, and\r\nfurther to the right again the broad brown flank of the Breithorn.\r\nBehind us Mont Cervin gathered the clouds more thickly round him, until\r\nfinally his grand obelisk was totally hidden. We went along the\r\nmountain-side for a time, and then descended to the glacier. The surface\r\nwas hard frozen, and the ice crunched loudly under our feet. There was a\r\nhollowness and volume in the sound which require explanation; and this,\r\nI think, is furnished by the remarks of Sir John Herschel on those\r\nhollow sounds at the Solfaterra, near Naples, from which travellers have\r\ninferred the existence of cavities within the mountain. At the place\r\nwhere these sounds are heard the earth is friable, and, when struck, the\r\nconcussion is reinforced and lengthened by the partial echoes from the\r\nsurfaces of the fragments. The conditions for a similar effect exist\r\nupon the glacier, for the ice is disintegrated to a certain depth, and\r\nfrom the innumerable places of rupture little reverberations are sent,\r\nwhich give a length and hollowness to the sound produced by the crushing\r\nof the fragments on the surface.\r\n\r\nWe looked to the sky at intervals, and once a meteor slid across it,\r\nleaving a train of sparks behind. The blue firmament, from which the\r\nstars shone down so brightly when we rose, was more and more invaded by\r\nclouds, which advanced upon us from our rear, while before us the solemn\r\nheights of Monte Rosa were bathed in rich yellow sunlight. As the day\r\nadvanced the radiance crept down towards the valleys; but still those\r\nstealthy clouds advanced like a besieging army, taking deliberate\r\npossession of the summits, one after the other, while gray skirmishers\r\nmoved through the air above us. The play of light and shadow upon Monte\r\nRosa was at times beautiful, bars of gloom and zones of glory shifting\r\nand alternating from top to bottom of the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADVANCE OF THE CLOUDS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock a gray cloud alighted on the shoulder of the Lyskamm,\r\nwhich had hitherto been warmed by the lovely yellow light. Soon\r\nafterwards we reached the foot of Monte Rosa, and passed from the\r\nglacier to a slope of rocks, whose rounded forms and furrowed surfaces\r\nshowed that the ice of former ages had moved over them; the granite was\r\nnow coated with lichens, and between the bosses where mould could rest\r\nwere patches of tender moss. As we ascended, a peal to the right\r\nannounced the descent of an avalanche from the Twins; it came heralded\r\nby clouds of ice-dust, which resembled the sphered masses of condensed\r\nvapour which issue from a locomotive. A gentle snow-slope brought us to\r\nthe base of a precipice of brown rocks, round which we wound; the snow\r\nwas in excellent order, and the chasms were so firmly bridged by the\r\nfrozen mass that no caution was necessary in crossing them. Surmounting\r\na weathered cliff to our left, we paused upon the summit to look upon\r\nthe scene around us. The snow gliding insensibly from the mountains, or\r\ndischarged in avalanches from the precipices which it overhung, filled\r\nthe higher valleys with pure white glaciers, which were rifted and\r\nbroken here and there, exposing chasms and precipices from which gleamed\r\nthe delicate blue of the half-formed ice. Sometimes, however, the\r\n_neves_ spread over wide spaces without a rupture or wrinkle to break\r\nthe smoothness of the superficial snow. The sky was now for the most\r\npart overcast, but through the residual blue spaces the sun at intervals\r\npoured light over the rounded bosses of the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MONTE ROSA CAPPED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven o'clock we reached another precipice of rock, to the\r\nleft of which our route lay, and here Lauener proposed to have some\r\nrefreshment; after which we went on again. The clouds spread more and\r\nmore, leaving at length mere specks and patches of blue between them.\r\nPassing some high peaks, formed by the dislocation of the ice, we came\r\nto a place where the _neve_ was rent by crevasses, on the walls of which\r\nthe stratification due to successive snow-falls was shown with great\r\nbeauty and definition. Between two of these fissures our way now lay:\r\nthe wall of one of them was hollowed out longitudinally midway down,\r\nthus forming a roof above and a ledge below, and from roof to ledge\r\nstretched a railing of cylindrical icicles, as if intended to bolt them\r\ntogether. A cloud now for the first time touched the summit of Monte\r\nRosa, and sought to cling to it, but in a minute it dispersed in\r\nshattered fragments, as if dashed to pieces for its presumption. The\r\nmountain remained for a time clear and triumphant, but the triumph was\r\nshort-lived: like suitors that will not be repelled, the dusky vapours\r\ncame; repulse after repulse took place, and the sunlight gushed down\r\nupon the heights, but it was manifest that the clouds gained ground in\r\nthe conflict.\r\n\r\nUntil about a quarter past nine o'clock our work was mere child's play,\r\na pleasant morning stroll along the flanks of the mountain; but steeper\r\nslopes now rose above us, which called for more energy, and more care in\r\nthe fixing of the feet. Looked at from below, some of these slopes\r\nappeared precipitous; but we were too well acquainted with the effect of\r\nfore-shortening to let this daunt us. At each step we dug our batons\r\ninto the deep snow. When first driven in, the batons[A] _dipped_ from\r\nus, but were brought, as we walked forward, to the vertical, and finally\r\nbeyond it at the other side. The snow was thus forced aside, a rubbing\r\nof the staff against it, and of the snow-particles against each other,\r\nbeing the consequence. We had thus perpetual rupture and regelation;\r\nwhile the little sounds consequent upon rupture, reinforced by the\r\npartial echoes from the surfaces of the granules, were blended together\r\nto a note resembling the lowing of cows. Hitherto I had paused at\r\nintervals to make notes, or to take an angle; but these operations now\r\nceased, not from want of time, but from pure dislike; for when the eye\r\nhas to act the part of a sentinel who feels that at any moment the enemy\r\nmay be upon him; when the body must be balanced with precision, and legs\r\nand arms, besides performing actual labour, must be kept in readiness\r\nfor possible contingencies; above all, when you feel that your safety\r\ndepends upon yourself alone, and that, if your footing gives way, there\r\nis no strong arm behind ready to be thrown between you and destruction;\r\nunder such circumstances the relish for writing ceases, and you are\r\nwilling to hand over your impressions to the safe keeping of memory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE \"COMB\" OF THE MOUNTAIN. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASCENT ALONG A CORNICE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nFrom the vast boss which constitutes the lower portion of Monte Rosa\r\ncliffy edges run upwards to the summit. Were the snow removed from these\r\nwe should, I doubt not, see them as toothed or serrated crags,\r\njustifying the term \"_kamm_,\" or \"comb,\" applied to such edges by the\r\nGermans. Our way now lay along such a kamm, the cliffs of which had,\r\nhowever, caught the snow, and been completely covered by it, forming an\r\nedge like the ridge of a house-roof, which sloped steeply upwards. On\r\nthe Lyskamm side of the edge there was no footing, and, if a human body\r\nfell over here, it would probably pass through a vertical space of some\r\nthousands of feet, falling or rolling, before coming to rest. On the\r\nother side the snow-slope was less steep, but excessively\r\nperilous-looking, and intersected by precipices of ice. Dense clouds now\r\nenveloped us, and made our position far uglier than if it had been\r\nfairly illuminated. The valley below us was one vast cauldron, filled\r\nwith precipitated vapour, which came seething at times up the sides of\r\nthe mountain. Sometimes this fog would partially clear away, and the\r\nlight would gleam upwards from the dislocated glaciers. My guide\r\ncontinually admonished me to make my footing sure, and to fix at each\r\nstep my staff firmly in the consolidated snow. At one place, for a short\r\nsteep ascent, the slope became hard ice, and our position a very\r\nticklish one. We hewed our steps as we moved upwards, but were soon glad\r\nto deviate from the ice to a position scarcely less awkward. The wind\r\nhad so acted upon the snow as to fold it over the edge of the kamm, thus\r\ncausing it to form a kind of cornice, which overhung the precipice on\r\nthe Lyskamm side of the mountain. This cornice now bore our weight: its\r\nsnow had become somewhat firm, but it was yielding enough to permit the\r\nfeet to sink in it a little way, and thus secure us at least against the\r\ndanger of slipping. Here also at each step we drove our batons firmly\r\ninto the snow, availing ourselves of whatever help they could render.\r\nOnce, while thus securing my anchorage, the handle of my hatchet went\r\nright through the cornice on which we stood, and, on withdrawing it, I\r\ncould see through the aperture into the cloud-crammed gulf below. We\r\ncontinued ascending until we reached a rock protruding from the snow,\r\nand here we halted for a few minutes. Lauener looked upwards through the\r\nfog. \"According to all description,\" he observed, \"this ought to be the\r\nlast kamm of the mountain; but in this obscurity we can see nothing.\"\r\nSnow began to fall, and we recommenced our journey, quitting the rocks\r\nand climbing again along the edge. Another hour brought us to a crest of\r\ncliffs, at which, to our comfort, the kamm appeared to cease, and other\r\nclimbing qualities were demanded of us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"DIE HOeCHSTE SPITZE.\" 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn the Lyskamm side, as I have said, rescue would be out of the\r\nquestion, should the climber go over the edge. On the other side of the\r\nedge rescue seemed possible, though the slope, as stated already, was\r\nmost dangerously steep. I now asked Lauener what he would have done,\r\nsupposing my footing to have failed on the latter slope. He did not\r\nseem to like the question, but said that he should have considered well\r\nfor a moment and then have sprung after me; but he exhorted me to drive\r\nall such thoughts away. I laughed at him, and this did more to set his\r\nmind at rest than any formal profession of courage could have done. We\r\nwere now among rocks: we climbed cliffs and descended them, and advanced\r\nsometimes with our feet on narrow ledges, holding tightly on to other\r\nledges by our fingers; sometimes, cautiously balanced, we moved along\r\nedges of rock with precipices on both sides. Once, in getting round a\r\ncrag, Lauener shook a book from his pocket; it was arrested by a rock\r\nabout sixty or eighty feet below us. He wished to regain it, but I\r\noffered to supply its place, if he thought the descent too dangerous. He\r\nsaid he would make the trial, and parted from me. I thought it useless\r\nto remain idle. A cleft was before me, through which I must pass; so,\r\npressing my knees and back against its opposite sides, I gradually\r\nworked myself to the top. I descended the other face of the rock, and\r\nthen, through a second ragged fissure, to the summit of another\r\npinnacle. The highest point of the mountain was now at hand, separated\r\nfrom me merely by a short saddle, carved by weathering out of the crest\r\nof the mountain. I could hear Lauener clattering after me, through the\r\nrocks behind. I dropped down upon the saddle, crossed it, climbed the\r\nopposite cliff, and \"_die hoechste Spitze_\" of Monte Rosa was won.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLOOM ON THE SUMMIT. 1858.]\r\n\r\nLauener joined me immediately, and we mutually congratulated each other\r\non the success of the ascent. The residue of the bread and meat was\r\nproduced, and a bottle of tea was also appealed to. Mixed with a little\r\ncognac, Lauener declared that he had never tasted anything like it. Snow\r\nfell thickly at intervals, and the obscurity was very great;\r\noccasionally this would lighten and permit the sun to shed a ghastly\r\ndilute light upon us through the gleaming vapour. I put my\r\nboiling-water apparatus in order, and fixed it in a corner behind a\r\nledge; the shelter was, however, insufficient, so I placed my hat above\r\nthe vessel. The boiling point was 184.92 deg. Fahr., the ledge on which the\r\ninstrument stood being 5 feet below the highest point of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe ascent from the Riffel hotel occupied us about seven hours, nearly\r\ntwo of which were spent upon the kamm and crest. Neither of us felt in\r\nthe least degree fatigued; I, indeed, felt so fresh, that had another\r\nMonte Rosa been planted on the first, I should have continued the climb\r\nwithout hesitation, and with strong hopes of reaching the top. I\r\nexperienced no trace of mountain sickness, lassitude, shortness of\r\nbreath, heart-beat, or headache; nevertheless the summit of Monte Rosa\r\nis 15,284 feet high, being less than 500 feet lower than Mont Blanc. It\r\nis, I think, perfectly certain, that the rarefaction of the air at this\r\nheight is not sufficient of itself to produce the symptoms referred to;\r\nphysical exertion must be superadded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"FROZEN FLOWERS.\" 1858.]\r\n\r\nAfter a few fitful efforts to dispel the gloom, the sun resigned the\r\ndominion to the dense fog and the descending snow, which now prevented\r\nour seeing more than 15 or 20 paces in any direction. The temperature of\r\nthe crags at the summit, which had been shone upon by the unclouded sun\r\nduring the earlier portion of the day, was 60 deg. Fahr.; hence the snow\r\nmelted instantly wherever it came in contact with the rock. But some of\r\nit fell upon my felt hat, which had been placed to shelter the\r\nboiling-water apparatus, and this presented the most remarkable and\r\nbeautiful appearance. The fall of snow was in fact a shower of frozen\r\nflowers. All of them were six-leaved; some of the leaves threw out\r\nlateral ribs like ferns, some were rounded, others arrowy and serrated,\r\nsome were close, others reticulated, but there was no deviation from the\r\nsix-leaved type. Nature seemed determined to make us some compensation\r\nfor the loss of all prospect, and thus showered down upon us those\r\nlovely blossoms of the frost; and had a spirit of the mountain inquired\r\nmy choice, the view, or the frozen flowers, I should have hesitated\r\nbefore giving up that exquisite vegetation. It was wonderful to think\r\nof, as well as beautiful to behold. Let us imagine the eye gifted with a\r\nmicroscopic power sufficient to enable it to see the molecules which\r\ncomposed these starry crystals; to observe the solid nucleus formed and\r\nfloating in the air; to see it drawing towards it its allied atoms, and\r\nthese arranging themselves as if they moved to music, and ended by\r\nrendering that music concrete. Surely such an exhibition of power, such\r\nan apparent demonstration of a resident intelligence in what we are\r\naccustomed to call \"brute matter,\" would appear perfectly miraculous.\r\nAnd yet the reality would, if we could see it, transcend the fancy. If\r\nthe Houses of Parliament were built up by the forces resident in their\r\nown bricks and lithologic blocks, and without the aid of hodman or\r\nmason, there would be nothing intrinsically more wonderful in the\r\nprocess than in the molecular architecture which delighted us upon the\r\nsummit of Monte Rosa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STARTLING AVALANCHE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nTwice or thrice had my guide warned me that we must think of descending,\r\nfor the snow continued to fall heavily, and the loss of our track would\r\nbe attended with imminent peril. We therefore packed up, and clambered\r\ndownward among the crags of the summit. We soon left these behind us,\r\nand as we stood once more upon the kamm, looking into the gloom beneath,\r\nan avalanche let loose from the side of an adjacent mountain shook the\r\nair with its thunder. We could not see it, could form no estimate of its\r\ndistance, could only hear its roar, which coming to us through the\r\ndarkness, had an undefinable element of horror in it. Lauener remarked,\r\n\"I never hear those things without a shudder; the memory of my brother\r\ncomes back to me at the same time.\" His brother, who was the best\r\nclimber in the Oberland, had been literally broken to fragments by an\r\navalanche on the slopes of the Jungfrau.\r\n\r\nWe had been separate coming up, each having trusted to himself, but the\r\ndescent was more perilous, because it is more difficult to fix the heel\r\nof the boot than the toe securely in the ice. Lauener was furnished with\r\na rope, which he now tied round my waist, and forming a noose at the\r\nother end, he slipped it over his arm. This to me was a new mode of\r\nattachment. Hitherto my guides in dangerous places had tied the ropes\r\nround _their_ waists also. Simond had done it on Mont Blanc, and Bennen\r\non the Finsteraarhorn, proving thus their willingness to share my fate\r\nwhatever that might be. But here Lauener had the power of sending me\r\nadrift at any moment, should his own life be imperilled. I told him that\r\nhis mode of attachment was new to me, but he assured me that it would\r\ngive him more power in case of accident. I did not see this at the time;\r\nbut neither did I insist on his attaching himself in the usual way. It\r\ncould neither be called anger nor pride, but a warm flush ran through me\r\nas I remarked, that I should take good care not to test his power of\r\nholding me. I believe I wronged my guide by the supposition that he made\r\nthe arrangement with reference to his own safety, for all I saw of him\r\nafterwards proved that he would at any time have risked his life to save\r\nmine. The flush however did me good, by displacing every trace of\r\nanxiety, and the rope, I confess, was also a source of some comfort to\r\nme. We descended the kamm, I going first. \"Secure your footing before\r\nyou move,\" was my guide's constant exhortation, \"and make your staff\r\nfirm at each step.\" We were sometimes quite close upon the rim of the\r\nkamm on the Lyskamm side, and we also followed the depressions which\r\nmarked our track along the cornice. This I now tried intentionally, and\r\ndrove the handle of my axe through it once or twice. At two places in\r\ndescending we were upon the solid ice, and these were some of the\r\nsteepest portions of the kamm. They were undoubtedly perilous, and the\r\nutmost caution was necessary in fixing the staff and securing the\r\nfooting. These however once past, we felt that the chief danger was\r\nover. We reached the termination of the edge, and although the snow\r\ncontinued to fall heavily, and obscure everything, we knew that our\r\nprogress afterwards was secure. There was pleasure in this feeling; it\r\nwas an agreeable variation of that grim mental tension to which I had\r\nbeen previously wound up, but which in itself was by no means\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPLENDID BLUE OF THE SNOW. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STIFLING HEAT. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI have already noticed the colour of the fresh snow upon the summit of\r\nthe Stelvio pass. Since I observed it there it has been my custom to pay\r\nsome attention to this point at all great elevations. This morning, as I\r\nascended Monte Rosa, I often examined the holes made in the snow by our\r\nbatons, but the light which issued from them was scarcely perceptibly\r\nblue. Now, however, a deep layer of fresh snow overspread the mountain,\r\nand the effect was magnificent. Along the kamm I was continually\r\nsurprised and delighted by the blue gleams which issued from the broken\r\nor perforated stratum of new snow; each hole made by the staff was\r\nfilled with a light as pure, and nearly as deep, as that of the\r\nunclouded firmament. When we reached the bottom of the kamm, Lauener\r\ncame to the front, and tramped before me. As his feet rose out of the\r\nsnow, and shook the latter off in fragments, sudden and wonderful gleams\r\nof blue light flashed from them. Doubtless the blue of the sky has much\r\nto do with mountain colouring, but in the present instance not only was\r\nthere no blue sky, but the air was so thick with fog and descending\r\nsnow-flakes, that we could not see twenty yards in advance of us. A\r\nthick fog, which wrapped the mountain quite closely, now added its gloom\r\nto the obscurity caused by the falling snow. Before we reached the base\r\nof the mountain the fog became thin, and the sun shone through it. There\r\nwas not a breath of air stirring, and, though we stood ankle-deep in\r\nsnow, the heat surpassed anything of the kind I had ever felt: it was\r\nthe dead suffocating warmth of the interior of an oven, which\r\nencompassed us on all sides, and from which there seemed no escape. Our\r\nown motion through the air, however, cooled us considerably. We found\r\nthe snow-bridges softer than in the morning, and consequently needing\r\nmore caution; but we encountered no real difficulty among them. Indeed\r\nit is amusing to observe the indifference with which a snow-roof is\r\noften broken through, and a traveller immersed to the waist in the jaws\r\nof a fissure. The effort at recovery is instantaneous; half\r\ninstinctively hands and knees are driven into the snow, and rescue is\r\nimmediate. Fair glacier work was now before us; after which we reached\r\nthe opposite mountain-slope, which we ascended, and then went down the\r\nflank of the Riffelberg to our hotel. The excursion occupied us eleven\r\nand a half hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] My staff was always the handle of an axe an inch or two longer than\r\nan ordinary walking-stick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(19.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 11th I made an attempt alone to ascend the\r\nRiffelhorn, and attained a considerable height; but I attacked it from\r\nthe wrong side, and the fading light forced me to retreat. I found some\r\nagreeable people at the hotel on my return. One clergyman especially,\r\nwith a clear complexion, good digestion, and bad lungs--of free, hearty,\r\nand genial manner--made himself extremely pleasant to us all. He\r\nappeared to bubble over with enjoyment, and with him and others on the\r\nmorning of the 13th I walked to the Goerner Grat, as it lay on the way to\r\nmy work. We had a glorious prospect from the summit: indeed the\r\nassemblage of mountains, snow, and ice, here within view is perhaps\r\nwithout a rival in the world.[A] I shouldered my axe, and saying\r\n\"good-bye\" moved away from my companions.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going?\" exclaimed the clergyman. \"Give me one grasp of your\r\nhand before we part.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for a grasp all round; and the hearty human kindness\r\nwhich thus showed itself contributed that day to make my work pleasant\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DIFFICULT DESCENT. 1858.]\r\n\r\nWe proceeded along the ridge of the Rothe Kumme to a point which\r\ncommanded a fine view of the glacier. The ice had been over these\r\nheights in ages past, for, although lichens covered the surfaces of the\r\nold rocks, they did not disguise the grooves and scratchings. The\r\nsurface of the glacier was now about a thousand feet below us, and this\r\nit was our desire to attain. To reach it we had to descend a succession\r\nof precipices, which in general were weathered and rugged, but here and\r\nthere, where the rock was durable, were fluted and grooved. Once or\r\ntwice indeed we had nothing to cling to but the little ridges thus\r\nformed. We had to squeeze ourselves through narrow fissures, and often\r\nto get round overhanging ledges, where our main trust was in our feet,\r\nbut where these had only ledges an inch or so in width to rest upon.\r\nThese cases were to me the most unpleasant of all, for they compelled\r\nthe arms to take a position which, if the footing gave way, would\r\nnecessitate a _wrench_, for which I entertain considerable abhorrence.\r\nWe came at length to a gorge by which the mountain is rent from top to\r\nbottom, and into which we endeavoured to descend. We worked along its\r\nrim for a time, but found its smooth faces too deep. We retreated;\r\nLauener struck into another track, and while he tested it I sat down\r\nnear some grass tufts, which flourished on one of the ledges, and found\r\nthe temperature to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Temperature of rock              42 deg. C.\r\n  Of air an inch above the rock    32\r\n  Of air a foot from rock          22\r\n  Of grass                         25\r\n\r\nThe first of these numbers does not fairly represent the temperature of\r\nthe rock, as the thermometer could be in contact with it only at one\r\nside at a time. It was differences such as these between grass and\r\nstone, producing a mixed atmosphere of different densities, that\r\nweakened the sound of the falls of the Orinoco, as observed and\r\nexplained by Humboldt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SINGULAR ICE-CAVE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nBy a process of \"trial and error\" we at length reached the ice, after\r\ntwo hours had been spent in the effort to disentangle ourselves from the\r\ncrags. The glacier is forcibly thrust at this place against the\r\nprojecting base of the mountain, and the structure of the ice\r\ncorrespondingly developed. Crevasses also intersect the ice, and the\r\nblue veins cross them at right angles. I ascended the glacier to a\r\nregion where the ice was compressed and greatly contorted, and thought\r\nthat in some cases I could see the veins crossing the lines of\r\nstratification. Once my guide drew my attention to what he called \"_ein\r\nsonderbares Loch_.\" On one of the slopes an archway was formed which\r\nappeared to lead into the body of the glacier. We entered it, and\r\nexplored the cavern to its end. The walls were of transparent blue ice,\r\nsingularly free from air-bubbles; but where the roof of the cavern was\r\nthin enough to allow the sun to shine feebly through it, the transmitted\r\nlight was of a pink colour. My guide expressed himself surprised at\r\n\"_den roethlichen Schein_.\" At one place a plate of ice had been placed\r\nlike a ceiling across the cavern; but owing to lateral squeezing it had\r\nbeen broken so as to form a V. I found some air-bubbles in this ice, and\r\nin all cases they were associated with blebs of water. A portion of the\r\n\"ceiling,\" indeed, was very full of bubbles, and was at some places\r\nreduced, by internal liquefaction, to a mere skeleton of ice, with\r\nwater-cells between its walls.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE AND STRATA. 1858.]\r\n\r\nHigh up the glacier (towards the old Weissthor) the horizontal\r\nstratification is everywhere beautifully shown. I drew my guide's\r\nattention to it, and he made the remark that the perfection of the lower\r\nice was due to the pressure of the layers above it. \"The snow by degrees\r\ncompressed itself to glacier.\" As we approached one of the tributaries\r\non the Monte Rosa side, where great pressure came into play, the\r\nstratification appeared to yield and the true structure to cross it at\r\nthose places where it had yielded most. As the place of greatest\r\npressure was approached, the bedding disappeared more and more, and a\r\nclear vertical structure was finally revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] In 1858 Mr. E. W. Cooke made a pencil-sketch of this splendid\r\npanorama, which is the best and truest that I have yet seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOeRNER GRAT AND THE RIFFELHORN. MAGNETIC PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n(20.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt an early hour on Saturday, the 14th of August, I heard the servant\r\nexclaim, \"_Das Wetter ist wunderschoen!_\" which good news caused me to\r\nspring from my bed and prepare to meet the morn. The range of summits at\r\nthe opposite side of the valley of St. Nicholas was at first quite\r\nclear, but as the sun ascended light cumuli formed round them,\r\nincreasing in density up to a certain point; below these clouds the air\r\nof the valley was transparent; above them the air of heaven was still\r\nmore so; and thus they swung midway between heaven and earth, ranging\r\nthemselves in a level line along the necks of the mountains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENERATION OF CLOUDS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the presence of the sun heating the air would\r\ntend to keep it more transparent, by increasing its capacity to dissolve\r\nall visible cloud; and this indeed is the true action of the sun. But it\r\nis not the only action. His rays, as he climbed the eastern heaven, shot\r\nmore and more deeply into the valley of St. Nicholas, the moisture of\r\nwhich rose as invisible vapour, remaining unseen as long as the air\r\npossessed sufficient warmth to keep it in the vaporous state. High up,\r\nhowever, the cold crags which had lost their heat by radiation the night\r\nbefore, acted like condensers upon the ascending vapour, and caused it\r\nto curdle into visible fog. The current, however, continued ascensional,\r\nand the clouds were slowly lifted above the tallest peaks, where they\r\narranged themselves in fantastic forms, shifting and changing shape as\r\nthey gradually melted away. One peak stood like a field-officer with\r\nhis cap raised above his head, others sent straggling cloud-balloons\r\nupwards; but on watching these outliers they were gradually seen to\r\ndisappear. At first they shone like snow in the sunlight, but as they\r\nbecame more attenuated they changed colour, passing through a dull red\r\nto a dusky purple hue, until finally they left no trace of their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ROCKS WARMED. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCENE FROM THE GOeRNER GRAT. 1858.]\r\n\r\nAs the day advanced, warming the rocks, the clouds wholly disappeared,\r\nand a hyaline air formed the setting of both glaciers and mountains. I\r\nclimbed to the Goerner Grat to obtain a general view of the surrounding\r\nscene. Looking towards the origin of the Goerner glacier the view was\r\nbounded by a wide col, upon which stood two lovely rounded eminences\r\nenamelled with snow of perfect purity. They shone like burnished silver\r\nin the sunlight, as if their surfaces had been melted and recongealed to\r\nfrosted mirrors from which the rays were flung. To the right of these\r\nwere the bounding crags of Monte Rosa, and then the body of the mountain\r\nitself, with its crest of crag and coat of snows. To the right of Monte\r\nRosa, and almost rivalling it in height, was the vast mass of the\r\nLyskamm, a rough and craggy mountain, to whose ledges clings the snow\r\nwhich cannot grasp its steeper walls, sometimes leaning over them in\r\nimpending precipices, which often break, and send wild avalanches into\r\nthe space below. Between the Lyskamm and Monte Rosa lies a large wide\r\nvalley into which both mountains pour their snows, forming there the\r\nWestern glacier of Monte Rosa[A]--a noble ice stream, which from its\r\nmagnitude and permanence deserves to impose its name upon the trunk\r\nglacier. It extends downwards from the col which unites the two\r\nmountains; riven and broken at some places, but at others stretching\r\nwhite and pure down to its snow-line, where the true glacier emerges\r\nfrom the _neve_. From the rounded shoulders of the Twin Castor a glacier\r\ndescends, at first white and shining, then suddenly broken into faults,\r\nfissures, and precipices, which are afterwards repaired, and the glacier\r\njoins that of Monte Rosa before the junction of the latter with the\r\ntrunk stream. Next came a boss of rock, with a secondary glacier\r\nclinging to it as if plastered over it, and after it the Schwarze\r\nglacier, bounded on one side by the Breithorn, and on the other by the\r\nTwin Pollux. This glacier is of considerable magnitude. Over its upper\r\nportion rise the Twin eminences, pure and white; then follows a smooth\r\nand undulating space, after passing which the _neve_ is torn up into a\r\ncollection of peaks and chasms; these, however, are mended lower down,\r\nand the glacier moves smoothly and calmly to meet its brothers in the\r\nmain valley. Next comes the Trifti glacier,[B] embraced on all sides by\r\nthe rocky arms of the Breithorn; its mass is not very great, but it\r\ndescends in a graceful sweep, and exhibits towards its extremity a\r\nsuccession of beautiful bands. Afterwards we have the glacier of the\r\nPetit Mont Cervin and those of St. Theodule, which latter are the last\r\nthat empty their frozen cargoes into the valley of the Goerner. All the\r\nglaciers here mentioned are welded together to a common trunk which\r\nsqueezes itself through the narrow defile at the base of the Riffelhorn.\r\nSoon afterwards the moraines become confused, the glacier drops steeply\r\nto its termination, and ploughs up the meadows in front of it with its\r\nirresistible share.\r\n\r\nIn a line with the Riffelhorn, and rising over the latter so high as to\r\nmake it almost vanish by comparison, was the Titan obelisk of the\r\nMatterhorn, from the base of which the Furgge glacier struggles\r\ndownwards. On the other side are the Zmutt glacier, the Schoenbuehl, and\r\nthe Hochwang, from the Dent Blanche; the Gabelhorn and Trift glaciers,\r\nfrom the summits which bear those names. Then come the glaciers of the\r\nWeisshorn. Describing a curve still farther to the right we alight on\r\nthe peaks of the Mischabel, dark and craggy precipices from this side,\r\nthough from the AEggischhorn they appear as cones of snow. Sweeping by\r\nthe Alphubel, the Allaleinhorn, the Rympfischorn, and Strahlhorn--all of\r\nthem majestic--we reach the pass of the Weissthor, and the Cima di\r\nJazzi. This completes the glorious circuit within the observer's view.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMPASS AT FAULT. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI placed my compass upon a piece of rock to find the bearing of the\r\nGoerner glacier, and was startled at seeing the sun and it at direct\r\nvariance. What the sun declared to be north, the needle affirmed to be\r\nsouth. I at first supposed that the maker had placed the S where the N\r\nought to be, and _vice versa_. On shifting my position, however, the\r\nneedle shifted also, and I saw immediately that the effect was due to\r\nthe rock of the Grat. Sometimes one end of the needle _dipped_ forcibly,\r\nat other places it whirled suddenly round, indicating an entire change\r\nof polarity. The rock was evidently to be regarded as an assemblage of\r\nmagnets, or as a single magnet full of \"consequent points.\" A distance\r\nof transport not exceeding an inch was, in some cases, sufficient to\r\nreverse the position of the needle. I held the needle between the two\r\nsides of a long fissure a foot wide. The needle set _along_ the fissure\r\nat some places, while at others it set _across_ it. Sometimes a little\r\njutting knob would attract the north end of the needle, while a closely\r\nadjacent little knob would forcibly repel it, and attract the south end.\r\nOne extremity of a ledge three feet long was north magnetic, the other\r\nend was south magnetic, while a neutral point existed midway between the\r\ntwo, the ledge having therefore the exact polar arrangement of an\r\nordinary bar-magnet. At the highest point of the rock the action\r\nappeared to be most intense, but I also found an energetic polarity in a\r\nmass at some distance below the summit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAGNETISM OF ROCKS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nRemembering that Professor Forbes had noticed some peculiar magnetic\r\neffect upon the Riffelhorn, I resolved to ascend it. Descending from the\r\nGrat we mounted the rocks which form the base of the horn; these are\r\nsoft and soapy from the quantity of mica which they contain; the higher\r\nrocks of the horn are, however, very dense and hard. The ascent is a\r\npleasant bit of mountain practice. We climbed the walls of rock, and\r\nwound round the ledges, seeking the assailable points. I tried the\r\nmagnetic condition of the rocks as we ascended, and found it in general\r\nfeeble. In other respects the Riffelhorn is a most remarkable mass. The\r\nice of the Goerner glacier of former ages, which rose hundreds, perhaps\r\nthousands of feet above its present level, encountered the horn in its\r\ndescent, and was split by the latter, a diversion of the ice along the\r\nsides of the peak being the consequence. Portions of the vertical walls\r\nof the horn are polished by this action as if they had come from the\r\nhands of a lapidary, and the scratchings are as sharp and definite as if\r\ndrawn by points of steel. I never saw scratchings so perfectly\r\npreserved: the finest lines are as clear as the deepest, a consequence\r\nof the great density and durability of the rock. The latter evidently\r\ncontains a good deal of iron, and its surface near the summit is of the\r\nrich brown red due to the peroxide of the metal. When we fairly got\r\namong the precipices we left our hatchets behind us, trusting\r\nsubsequently to our hands and feet alone. Squeezing, creeping, clinging,\r\nand climbing, in due time we found ourselves upon the summit of the\r\nhorn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASCENT OF THE RIFFELHORN. 1858.]\r\n\r\nA pile of stones had been erected near the point where we gained the\r\ntop. I examined the stones of this pile, and found them strongly polar.\r\nThe surrounding rocks also showed a violent action, the needle\r\noscillating quickly, and sometimes twirling swiftly round upon a slight\r\nchange of position. The fragments of rock scattered about were also\r\npolar. Long ledges showed north magnetism for a considerable length, and\r\nagain for an equal length south magnetism. Two parallel masses separated\r\nfrom each other by a fissure, showed the same magnetic distribution.\r\nWhile I was engaged at one end of the horn, Lauener wandered to the\r\nother, on which stood two or three _hommes de pierres_. He was about\r\ndisturbing some of the stones, when a yell from me surprised him. In\r\nfact, the thought had occurred to me that the magnetism of the horn had\r\nbeen developed by lightning striking upon it, and my desire was to\r\nexamine those points which were most exposed to the discharge of the\r\natmospheric electricity; hence my shout to my guide to let the stones\r\nalone. I worked towards the other end of the horn, examining the rocks\r\nin my way. Two weathered prominences, which seemed very likely\r\nrecipients of the lightning, acted violently upon the needle. I\r\nsometimes descended a little way, and found that among the rocks below\r\nthe summit the action was greatly enfeebled. On reaching another very\r\nprominent point, I found its extremity all north polar, but at a little\r\ndistance was a cluster of consequent points, among which the transport\r\nof a few inches was sufficient to turn the needle round and round.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAGNETISM OF THE HORN. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe piles of stone at the Zermatt end of the horn did not seem so\r\nstrongly polar as the pile at the other end, which was higher; still a\r\nstrong polar action was manifested at many points of the surrounding\r\nrocks. Having completed the examination of the summit, I descended the\r\nhorn, and examined its magnetic condition as I went along. It seemed to\r\nme that the jutting prominences always exhibited the strongest action. I\r\ndo not indeed remember any case in which a strong action did not\r\nexhibit itself at the ends of the terraces which constitute the horn. In\r\nall cases, however, the rock acted as a number of magnets huddled\r\nconfusedly together, and not as if its entire mass was endowed with\r\nmagnetism of one kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Magnetic Boulder of the Riffelhorn.]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day I examined the lower spur of the\r\nRiffelhorn. Amid its fissures and gullies one feels as if wandering\r\nthrough the ruins of a vast castle or fortification; the precipices are\r\nso like walls, and the scratching and polishing so like what might be\r\ndone by the hands of man. I found evidences of strong polar action in\r\nsome of the rocks low down. In the same continuous mass the action would\r\nsometimes exhibit itself over an area of small extent, while the\r\nremainder of the rock showed no appreciable action. Some of the boulders\r\ncast down from the summit exhibited a strong and varied polarity. Fig. 8\r\nis a sketch of one of these; the barbed end of each arrow represents the\r\nnorth end of the needle, which assumed the various positions shown in\r\nthe figure. Midway down the spur I lighted upon a transverse wall of\r\nrock, which formed in earlier ages the boundary of a lateral outlet of\r\nthe Goerner glacier. It was red and hard, weathered rough at some places,\r\nand polished smooth at others. The lines were drawn finely upon it, but\r\nits outer surface appeared to be peeling off like a crust; the polished\r\nlayer rested upon the rock like a kind of enamel. The action of the\r\nglacier appeared to resemble that of the break of a locomotive upon\r\nrails, both being cases of exfoliation brought about by pressure and\r\nfriction. This wall measured twenty-eight yards across, and one end of\r\nit, for a distance of ten or twelve yards, was all north polar; the\r\nother end for a similar distance was south polar, but there was a pair\r\nof consequent points at its centre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MAGNETIC FORCE. 1868.]\r\n\r\nTo meet the case of my young readers, I will here say a few words about\r\nthe magnetic force. The common magnetic needle points nearly north and\r\nsouth; and if a bit of iron be brought near to either end of the needle,\r\nthey will mutually attract each other. A piece of lead will not show\r\nthis effect, nor will copper, gold, nor silver. Iron, in fact, is a\r\nmagnetic metal, which the others are not. It is to be particularly\r\nobserved, that the bit of iron attracts _both ends_ of the needle when\r\nit is presented to them in succession; and if a common steel sewing\r\nneedle be substituted for the iron it will be seen that it also has the\r\npower of attracting both ends of the magnetic needle. But if the needle\r\nbe rubbed once or twice along one end of a magnet, it will be found that\r\none of its ends will afterwards _repel_ a certain end of the magnetic\r\nneedle and attract the other. By rubbing the needle on the magnet, we\r\nthus develop both attraction and repulsion, and this double action of\r\nthe magnetic force is called its _polarity_; thus the steel which was at\r\nfirst simply _magnetic_, is now magnetic and _polar_.\r\n\r\nIt is the aim of persons making magnets, that each magnet should have\r\nbut _two_ poles, at its two ends; it is, however, easy to develop in the\r\nsame piece of steel several pairs or poles; and if the magnetization be\r\nirregular, this is sometimes done when we wish to avoid it. These\r\nirregular poles are called _consequent points_.\r\n\r\nNow I want my young reader to understand that it is not only because the\r\nrocks of the Goerner Grat and Riffelhorn contain iron, that they exhibit\r\nthe action which I have described. They are not only magnetic, as common\r\niron is, but, like the magnetized steel needle, they are magnetic and\r\npolar. And these poles are irregularly distributed like the \"consequent\r\npoints\" to which I have referred, and this is the reason why I have used\r\nthe term.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEARINGS FROM THE RIFFELHORN. 1858.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Forbes, as I have already stated, was the first to notice the\r\neffect of the Riffelhorn upon the magnetic needle, but he seems to have\r\nsupposed that the entire mass of the mountain exercised \"a local\r\nattraction\" upon the needle; (upon which end he does not say). To enable\r\nfuture observers to allow for this attraction, he took the bearing of\r\nseveral of the surrounding mountains from the Riffelhorn; but it is very\r\nprobable that had he changed his position a few inches, and perfectly\r\ncertain had he changed it a few yards, he would have found a set of\r\nbearings totally different from those which he has recorded. The close\r\nproximity and irregular distribution of its consequent points would\r\nprevent the Riffelhorn from exerting any appreciable influence on _a\r\ndistant needle_, as in this case the local poles would effectually\r\nneutralize each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Now called, in the Federal map, the 'Grenz glacier.'--L. C. T.\r\n\r\n[B] I take this name from Studer's map. Sometimes, however, I have\r\ncalled it the \"Breithorn glacier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(21.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MONT CERVIN AS CLOUD-MAKER. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th the Riffelberg was swathed in a dense fog,\r\nthrough which heavy rain showered incessantly. Towards one o'clock the\r\ncontinuity of the gray mass was broken, and sky-gleams of the deepest\r\nblue were seen through its apertures; these would close up again, and\r\nothers open elsewhere, as if the fog were fighting for existence with\r\nthe sun behind it. The sun, however, triumphed, the mountains came more\r\nand more into view, and finally the entire air was swept clear. I went\r\nup to the Goerner Grat in the afternoon, and examined more closely the\r\nmagnetism of its rocks; here, as on the Riffelhorn, I found it most\r\npronounced at the jutting prominences of the Grat. Can it be that the\r\nsuperior exposure is more favourable to the formation of the magnetic\r\noxide of iron? I secured a number of fragments, which I still possess,\r\nand which act forcibly upon a magnetic needle. The sun was near the\r\nwestern horizon, and I remained alone upon the Grat to see his last\r\nbeams illuminate the mountains, which, with one exception, were without\r\na trace of cloud. This exception was the Matterhorn, the appearance of\r\nwhich was extremely instructive. The obelisk appeared to be divided in\r\ntwo halves by a vertical line drawn from its summit half way down, to\r\nthe windward of which we had the bare cliffs of the mountain; and to the\r\nleft of it a cloud which appeared to cling tenaciously to the rocks. In\r\nreality, however, there was no clinging; the condensed vapour\r\nincessantly got away, but it was ever renewed, and thus a river of cloud\r\nhad been sent from the mountain over the valley of Aosta. The wind in\r\nfact blew lightly up the valley of St. Nicholas charged with moisture,\r\nand when the air that held it rubbed against the cold cone of the\r\nMatterhorn the vapour was chilled and precipitated in his lee. The\r\nsummit seemed to smoke sometimes like a burning mountain; for\r\nimmediately after its generation, the fog was drawn away in long\r\nfilaments by the wind. As the sun sank lower the ruddiness of his light\r\naugmented, until these filaments resembled streamers of flame. The sun\r\nsank deeper, the light was gradually withdrawn, and where it had\r\nentirely vanished it left the mountain like a desolate old man whose\r\n\r\n                            \"hoary hair\r\n  Stream'd like a meteor in the troubled air.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment after the sun had disappeared the scene was amazingly\r\ngrand. The distant west was ruddy, copious gray smoke-wreaths were\r\nwafted from the mountains, while high overhead, in an atmospheric region\r\nwhich seemed perfectly motionless, floated a broad thin cloud, dyed with\r\nthe richest iridescences. The colours were of the same character as\r\nthose which I had seen upon the Aletschhorn, being due to interference,\r\nand in point of splendour and variety far exceeded anything ever\r\nproduced by the mere coloured light of the setting sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CELLS IN THE ICE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn the 16th I was early upon the glacier. It had frozen hard during the\r\nnight, and the partially liberated streams flowed, in many cases, over\r\ntheir own ice. I took some clear plates from under the water, and found\r\nin them numerous liquid cells, each associated with an air-bubble or a\r\nvacuous spot. The most common shape of the cells was a regular hexagon,\r\nbut there were all forms between the perfect hexagon and the perfect\r\ncircle. Many cells had also crimped borders, intimating that their\r\nprimitive form was that of a flower with six leaves. A plate taken from\r\nice which was defended from the sunbeams by the shadow of a rock had no\r\nsuch cells; so that those that I observed were probably due to solar\r\nradiation.\r\n\r\nMy first aim was to examine the structure of the Goernerhorn glacier,[A]\r\nwhich descends the breast of Monte Rosa until it is abruptly cut off by\r\nthe great Western glacier of the mountain.[B] Between them is a moraine\r\nwhich is at once terminal as regards the former, and lateral as regards\r\nthe latter. The ice is veined vertically along the moraine, the\r\ndirection of the structure being parallel to the latter. I ascended the\r\nglacier, and found, as I retreated from the place where the thrust was\r\nmost violent, that the structure became more feeble. From the glacier I\r\npassed to the rocks called \"_auf der Platte_,\" so as to obtain a general\r\nview of its terminal portion. The gradual perfecting of the structure as\r\nthe region of pressure was approached was very manifest: the ice at the\r\nend seemed to wrinkle up in obedience to the pressure, the structural\r\nfurrows, from being scarcely visible, became more and more decided, and\r\nthe lamination underneath correspondingly pronounced, until it finally\r\nattained a state of great perfection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE OF THE ICE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI now quitted the rocks and walked straight across the Western glacier\r\nof Monte Rosa to its centre, where I found the structure scarcely\r\nvisible. I next faced the Goerner Grat, and walked down the glacier\r\ntowards the moraine which divides it from the Goerner glacier. The\r\nmechanical conditions of the ice here are quite evident; each step\r\nbrought me to a place of greater pressure, and also to a place of more\r\nhighly developed structure, until finally near to the moraine itself,\r\nand running parallel to it, a magnificent lamination was developed. Here\r\nthe superficial groovings could be traced to great distances, and beside\r\nthe moraine were boulders poised on pedestals of ice through which the\r\nblue veins ran. At some places the ice had been weathered into laminae\r\nnot more than a line in thickness.\r\n\r\nI now recrossed the Monte Rosa glacier to its junction with the\r\nSchwartze glacier, which descends between the Twins and Breithorn. The\r\nstructure of the Monte Rosa glacier is here far less pronounced than at\r\nthe other side, and the pressure which it endures is also manifestly\r\nless; the structure of the Schwartze glacier is fairly developed, being\r\nhere parallel to its moraine. The cliffs of the Breithorn are much\r\nexposed to weathering action, and boulders are copiously showered down\r\nupon the adjacent ice. Between the Schwartze glacier and the glacier\r\nwhich descends from the breast of the Breithorn itself these blocks ride\r\nupon a spine of ice, and form a moraine of grand proportions. From it a\r\nfine view of the glacier is attainable, and the gradual development of\r\nits structure as the region of maximum pressure is approached is very\r\nplain. A number of gracefully curved undulations sweep across the\r\nBreithorn glacier, which are squeezed more closely together as the\r\nmoraine is approached. All the glaciers that descend from the flanking\r\nmountains of the Goerner valley are suddenly turned aside where they meet\r\nthe great trunk stream, and are reduced by the pressure to narrow\r\nstripes of ice separated from each other by parallel moraines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRIBUTARIES EXPLORED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI ascended the Breithorn glacier to the base of an ice-fall, on one side\r\nof which I found large crumples produced by the pressure, the veined\r\nstructure being developed at right angles to the direction of the\r\nlatter. No such structure was visible above this place. The crumples\r\nwere cut by fissures, perpendicular to which the blue veins ran. I now\r\nquitted the glacier, and clambered up the adjacent alp, from which a\r\nfine view of the general surface was attainable. As in the case of the\r\nGoernerhorn glacier, the gradual perfecting of the structure was very\r\nmanifest; the dirt, which first irregularly scattered over the surface,\r\ngradually assumed a striated appearance, and became more and more\r\ndecided as the moraine was approached. Descending from the alp, I\r\nendeavoured to measure some of the undulations; proceeding afterwards to\r\nthe junction of the Breithorn glacier with that of St. Theodule. The end\r\nof the latter appears to be crumpled by its thrust against the former,\r\nand the moraine between them, instead of being raised, runs along a\r\nhollow which is flanked by the crumples on either side. The Breithorn\r\nglacier became more and more attenuated, until finally it actually\r\nvanished under its own moraines. On the sides of the crevasses, by which\r\nthe Theodule glacier is here intersected, I thought I could plainly see\r\ntwo systems of veins cutting each other at an angle of fifteen or twenty\r\ndegrees. Reaching the Goerner glacier, at a place where its dislocation\r\nwas very great, I proceeded down it past the Riffelhorn, to a point\r\nwhere it seemed possible to scale the opposite mountain wall. Here I\r\ncrossed the glacier, treading with the utmost caution along the combs of\r\nice, and winding through the entanglement of crevasses until the spur of\r\nthe Riffelhorn was reached; this I climbed to its summit, and afterwards\r\ncrossed the green alp to our hotel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TEMPTATION. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing good day's work was rewarded by a sound sleep at night.\r\nThe tourists were called in succession next morning, but after each call\r\nI instantly subsided into deep slumber, and thus healthily spaced out\r\nthe interval of darkness. Day at length dawned and gradually brightened.\r\nI looked at my watch and found it twenty minutes to six. My guide had\r\nbeen lent to a party of gentlemen who had started at three o'clock for\r\nthe summit of Monte Rosa, and he had left with me a porter who undertook\r\nto conduct me to one of the adjacent glaciers. But as I looked from my\r\nwindow the unspeakable beauty of the morning filled me with a longing to\r\nsee the world from the top of Monte Rosa. I was in exceedingly good\r\ncondition--could I not reach the summit alone? Trained and indurated as\r\nI had been, I felt that the thing was possible; at all events I could\r\ntry, without attempting anything which was not clearly within my power.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Now called, in the Federal map, the \"Monte Rosa glacier.\" Goernerhorn\r\nis an old local name for the central mass of Monte Rosa.--L. C. T.\r\n\r\n[B] _See_ p. 138, footnote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ASCENT OF MONTE ROSA, 1858.\r\n\r\n(22.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A LIGHT SCRIP. 1858.]\r\n\r\nWhether my exercise be mental or bodily, I am always most vigorous when\r\ncool. During my student life in Germany, the friends who visited me\r\nalways complained of the low temperature of my room, and here among the\r\nAlps it was no uncommon thing for me to wander over the glaciers from\r\nmorning till evening in my shirt-sleeves. My object now was to go as\r\nlight as possible, and hence I left my coat and neckcloth behind me,\r\ntrusting to the sun and my own motion to make good the calorific waste.\r\nAfter breakfast I poured what remained of my tea into a small glass\r\nbottle, an ordinary demi-bouteille, in fact; the waiter then provided me\r\nwith a ham sandwich, and, with my scrip thus frugally furnished, I\r\nthought the heights of Monte Rosa might be won. I had neither brandy nor\r\nwine, but I knew the immense amount of mechanical force represented by\r\nfour ounces of bread and ham, and I therefore feared no failure from\r\nlack of nutriment. Indeed, I am inclined to think that both guides and\r\ntravellers often impair their vigour and render themselves cowardly and\r\napathetic by the incessant \"refreshing\" which they deem it necessary to\r\nindulge in on such occasions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GUIDE EXPOSTULATES. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GUIDE HALTS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe guide whom Lauener intended for me was at the door; I passed him and\r\ndesired him to follow me. This he at first refused to do, as he did not\r\nrecognise me in my shirt-sleeves; but his companions set him right, and\r\nhe ran after me. I transferred my scrip to his shoulders, and led the\r\nway upward. Once or twice he insinuated that that was not the way to the\r\nSchwarze-See, and was probably perplexed by my inattention. From the\r\nsummit of the ridge which bounds the Goerner glacier the whole grand\r\npanorama revealed itself, and on the higher slopes of Monte Rosa--so\r\nhigh, indeed, as to put all hope of overtaking them, or even coming near\r\nthem, out of the question--a row of black dots revealed the company\r\nwhich had started at three o'clock from the hotel. They had made\r\nremarkably good use of their time, and I was afterwards informed that\r\nthe cause of this was the intense cold, which compelled them to keep up\r\nthe proper supply of heat by increased exertion. I descended swiftly to\r\nthe glacier, and made for the base of Monte Rosa, my guide following at\r\nsome distance behind me. One of the streams, produced by superficial\r\nmelting, had cut for itself a deep wide channel in the ice; it was not\r\ntoo wide for a spring, and with the aid of a run I cleared it and went\r\non. Some minutes afterwards I could hear the voice of my companion\r\nexclaiming, in a tone of expostulation, \"No, no, I won't follow you\r\nthere.\" He however made a circuit, and crossed the stream; I waited for\r\nhim at the place where the Monte Rosa glacier joins the rock, \"_auf der\r\nPlatte_,\" and helped him down the ice-slope. At the summit of these\r\nrocks I again waited for him. He approached me with some excitement of\r\nmanner, and said that it now appeared plain to him that I intended to\r\nascend Monte Rosa, but that he would not go with me. I asked him to\r\naccompany me to the summit of the next cliff, which he agreed to do; and\r\nI found him of some service to me. He discovered the faint traces of the\r\nparty in advance, and, from his greater experience, could keep them\r\nbetter in view than I could. We lost them, however, near the base of the\r\ncliff at which we aimed, and I went on, choosing as nearly as I could\r\nremember the route followed by Lauener and myself a week previously,\r\nwhile my guide took another route, seeking for the traces. The glacier\r\nhere is crevassed, and I was among the fissures some distance in advance\r\nof my companion. Fear was manifestly getting the better of him, and he\r\nfinally stood still, exclaiming, \"No man can pass there.\" At the same\r\nmoment I discovered the trace, and drew his attention to it; he\r\napproached me submissively, said that I was quite right, and declared\r\nhis willingness to go on. We climbed the cliff, and discovered the trace\r\nin the snow above it. Here I transferred the scrip and telescope to my\r\nown shoulders, and gave my companion a cheque for five francs. He\r\nreturned, and I went on alone.\r\n\r\nThe sun and heaven were glorious, but the cold was nevertheless intense,\r\nfor it had frozen bitterly the night before. The mountain seemed more\r\nnoble and lovely than when I had last ascended it; and as I climbed the\r\nslopes, crossed the shining cols, and rounded the vast snow-bosses of\r\nthe mountain, the sense of being alone lent a new interest to the\r\nglorious scene. I followed the track of those who preceded me, which was\r\nthat pursued by Lauener and myself a week previously. Once I deviated\r\nfrom it to obtain a glimpse of Italy over the saddle which stretches\r\nfrom Monte Rosa to the Lyskamm. Deep below me was the valley, with its\r\nhuge and dislocated _neve_, and the slope on which I hung was just\r\nsufficiently steep to keep the attention aroused without creating\r\nanxiety. I prefer such a slope to one on which the thought of danger\r\ncannot be entertained. I become more weary upon a dead level, or in\r\nwalking up such a valley as that which stretches between Visp and\r\nZermatt, than on a steep mountain side. The sense of weariness is often\r\nno index to the expenditure of muscular force: the muscles may be\r\ncharged with force, and, if the nervous excitant be feeble, the strength\r\nlies dormant, and we are tired without exertion. But the thought of\r\nperil keeps the mind awake, and spurs the muscles into action; they move\r\nwith alacrity and freedom, and the time passes swiftly and pleasantly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEFT ALONE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOccupied with my own thoughts as I ascended, I sometimes unconsciously\r\nwent too quickly, and felt the effects of the exertion. I then slackened\r\nmy pace, allowing each limb an instant of repose as I drew it out of the\r\nsnow, and found that in this way walking became rest. This is an\r\nillustration of the principle which runs throughout nature--to\r\naccomplish physical changes, _time_ is necessary. Different positions of\r\nthe limb require different molecular arrangements; and to pass from one\r\nto the other requires time. By lifting the leg slowly and allowing it to\r\nfall forward by its own gravity, a man may get on steadily for several\r\nhours, while a very slight addition to this pace may speedily exhaust\r\nhim. Of course the normal pace differs in different persons, but in all\r\nthe power of endurance may be vastly augmented by the prudent outlay of\r\nmuscular force.\r\n\r\nThe sun had long shone down upon me with intense fervour, but I now\r\nnoticed a strange modification of the light upon the slopes of\r\nsnow. I looked upwards, and saw a most gorgeous exhibition of\r\ninterference-colours. A light veil of clouds had drawn itself between me\r\nand the sun, and this was flooded with the most brilliant dyes. Orange,\r\nred, green, blue--all the hues produced by diffraction were exhibited in\r\nthe utmost splendour. There seemed a tendency to form circular zones of\r\ncolour round the sun, but the clouds were not sufficiently uniform to\r\npermit of this, and they were consequently broken into spaces, each\r\nsteeped with the colour due to the condition of the cloud at the place.\r\nThree times during my ascent similar veils drew themselves across the\r\nsun, and at each passage the splendid phenomena were renewed. As I\r\nreached the middle of the mountain an avalanche was let loose from the\r\nsides of the Lyskamm; the thunder drew my eyes to the place; I saw the\r\nice move, but it was only the tail of the avalanche; still the volume of\r\nsound told me that it was a huge one. Suddenly the front of it appeared\r\nfrom behind a projecting rock, hurling its ice-masses with fury into the\r\nvalley, and tossing its rounded clouds of ice-dust high into the\r\natmosphere. A wild long-drawn sound, multiplied by echoes, now descended\r\nfrom the heights above me. It struck me at first as a note of\r\nlamentation, and I thought that possibly one of the party which was now\r\nnear the summit had gone over the precipice. On listening more\r\nattentively I found that the sound shaped itself into an English\r\n\"hurrah!\" I was evidently nearing the party, and on looking upwards I\r\ncould see them, but still at an immense height above me. The summit\r\nstill rose before them, and I therefore thought the cheer premature. A\r\nprecipice of ice was now in front of me, around which I wound to the\r\nright, and in a few minutes found myself fairly at the bottom of the\r\nKamm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GIDDINESS ON THE KAMM. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCRIP LEFT BEHIND. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI paused here for a moment, and reflected on the work before me. My head\r\nwas clear, my muscles in perfect condition, and I felt just sufficient\r\nfear to render me careful. I faced the Kamm, and went up slowly but\r\nsurely, and soon heard the cheer which announced the arrival of the\r\nparty at the summit of the mountain. It was a wild, weird, intermittent\r\nsound, swelling or falling as the echoes reinforced or enfeebled it. In\r\ngetting through the rocks which protrude from the snow at the base of\r\nthe last spur of the mountain, I once had occasion to stoop my head,\r\nand, on suddenly raising it, my eyes swam as they rested on the unbroken\r\nslope of snow at my left. The sensation was akin to giddiness, but I\r\nbelieve it was chiefly due to the absence of any object upon the snow\r\nupon which I could converge the axes of my eyes. Up to this point I had\r\neaten nothing. I now unloosed my scrip, and had two mouthfuls of\r\nsandwich and nearly the whole of the tea that remained. I found here\r\nthat my load, light as it was, impeded me. When fine balancing is\r\nnecessary, the presence of a very light load, to which one is\r\nunaccustomed, may introduce an element of danger, and for this reason I\r\nhere left the residue of my tea and sandwich behind me. A long, long\r\nedge was now in front of me, sloping steeply upwards. As I commenced the\r\nascent of this, the foremost of those whose cheer had reached me from\r\nthe summit some time previously, appeared upon the top of the edge, and\r\nthe whole party was seen immediately afterwards dangling on the Kamm. We\r\nmutually approached each other. Peter Bohren, a well-known Oberland\r\nguide, came first, and after him came the gentleman in his immediate\r\ncharge. Then came other guides with other gentlemen, and last of all my\r\nguide, Lauener, with his strong right arm round the youngest of the\r\nparty. We met where a rock protruded through the snow. The cold smote my\r\nnaked throat bitterly, so to protect it I borrowed a handkerchief from\r\nLauener, bade my new acquaintances good bye, and proceeded upwards. I\r\nwas soon at the place where the snow-ridge joins the rocks which\r\nconstitute the crest of the mountain; through these my way lay, every\r\nstep I took augmenting my distance from all life, and increasing my\r\nsense of solitude. I went up and down the cliffs as before, round\r\nledges, through fissures, along edges of rock, over the last deep and\r\nrugged indentation, and up the rocks at its opposite side, to the\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALONE ON THE SUMMIT. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE AXE SLIPS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nA world of clouds and mountains lay beneath me. Switzerland, with its\r\npomp of summits, was clear and grand; Italy was also grand, but more\r\nthan half obscured. Dark cumulus and dark crag vied in savagery, while\r\nat other places white snows and white clouds held equal rivalry. The\r\nscooped valleys of Monte Rosa itself were magnificent, all gleaming in\r\nthe bright sunlight--tossed and torn at intervals, and sending from\r\ntheir rents and walls the magical blue of the ice. Ponderous _neves_ lay\r\nupon the mountains, apparently motionless, but suggesting\r\nmotion--sluggish, but indicating irresistible dynamic energy, which\r\nmoved them slowly to their doom in the warmer valleys below. I thought\r\nof my position: it was the first time that a man had stood alone upon\r\nthat wild peak, and were the imagination let loose amid the surrounding\r\nagencies, and permitted to dwell upon the perils which separated the\r\nclimber from his kind, I dare say curious feelings might have been\r\nengendered. But I was prompt to quell all thoughts which might lessen my\r\nstrength, or interfere with the calm application of it. Once indeed an\r\naccident made me shudder. While taking the cork from a bottle which is\r\ndeposited on the top, and which contains the names of those who have\r\nascended the mountain, my axe slipped out of my hand, and slid some\r\nthirty feet away from me. The thought of losing it made my flesh creep,\r\nfor without it descent would be utterly impossible. I regained it, and\r\nlooked upon it with an affection which might be bestowed upon a living\r\nthing, for it was literally my staff of life under the circumstances.\r\nOne look more over the cloud-capped mountains of Italy, and I then\r\nturned my back upon them, and commenced the descent.\r\n\r\nThe brown crags seemed to look at me with a kind of friendly\r\nrecognition, and, with a surer and firmer feeling than I possessed on\r\nascending, I swung myself from crag to crag and from ledge to ledge with\r\na velocity which surprised myself. I reached the summit of the Kamm, and\r\nsaw the party which I had passed an hour and a half before, emerging\r\nfrom one of the hollows of the mountain; they had escaped from the edge\r\nwhich now lay between them and me. The thought of the possible loss of\r\nmy axe at the summit was here forcibly revived, for without it I dared\r\nnot take a single step. My first care was to anchor it firmly in the\r\nsnow, so as to enable it to bear at times nearly the whole weight of my\r\nbody. In some places, however, the anchor had but a loose hold; the\r\n\"cornice\" to which I have already referred became granular, and the\r\nhandle of the axe went through it up to the head, still, however,\r\nremaining loose. Some amount of trust had thus to be withdrawn from the\r\nstaff and placed in the limbs. A curious mixture of carelessness and\r\nanxiety sometimes fills the mind on such occasions. I often caught\r\nmyself humming a verse of a frivolous song, but this was mechanical, and\r\nthe substratum of a man's feelings under such circumstances is real\r\nearnestness. The precipice to my left was a continual preacher of\r\ncaution, and the slope to my right was hardly less impressive. I looked\r\ndown the former but rarely, and sometimes descended for a considerable\r\ntime without looking beyond my own footsteps. The power of a thought was\r\nillustrated on one of these occasions. I had descended with extreme\r\nslowness and caution for some time, when looking over the edge of the\r\ncornice I saw a row of pointed rocks at some distance below me. These I\r\nfelt must receive me if I slipped over, and I thought how before\r\nreaching them I might so break my fall as to arrive at them unkilled.\r\nThis thought enabled me to double my speed, and as long as the spiky\r\nbarrier ran parallel to my track I held my staff in one hand, and\r\ncontented myself with a slight pressure upon it.\r\n\r\nI came at length to a place where the edge was solid ice, which rose to\r\nthe level of the cornice, the latter appearing as if merely stuck\r\nagainst it. A groove ran between the ice and snow, and along this groove\r\nI marched until the cornice became unsafe, and I had to betake myself to\r\nthe ice. The place was really perilous, but, encouraging myself by the\r\nreflection that it would not last long, I carefully and deliberately\r\nhewed steps, causing them to dip a little inward, so as to afford a\r\npurchase for the heel of my boot, never forsaking one till the next was\r\nready, and never wielding my hatchet until my balance was secured. I was\r\nsoon at the bottom of the Kamm, fairly out of danger, and full of glad\r\nvigour I bore swiftly down upon the party in advance of me. It was an\r\neasy task to me to fuse myself amongst them as if I had been an old\r\nacquaintance, and we joyfully slid, galloped, and rolled together down\r\nthe residue of the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ACCIDENT ON THE KAMM. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe only exception was the young gentleman in Lauener's care. A day or\r\ntwo previously he had, I believe, injured himself in crossing the Gemmi,\r\nand long before he reached the summit of Monte Rosa his knee swelled,\r\nand he walked with great difficulty. But he persisted in ascending, and\r\nLauener, seeing his great courage, thought it a pity to leave him\r\nbehind. I have stated that a portion of the Kamm was solid ice. On\r\ndescending this, Mr. F.'s footing gave way, and he slipped forward.\r\nLauener was forced to accompany him, for the place was too steep and\r\nslippery to permit of their motion being checked. Both were on the point\r\nof going over the Lyskamm side of the mountain, where they would have\r\nindubitably been dashed to pieces. \"There was no escape there,\" said\r\nLauener, in describing the incident to me subsequently, \"but I saw a\r\npossible rescue at the other side, so I sprang to the right, forcibly\r\nswinging my companion round; but in doing so, the baton tripped me up;\r\nwe both fell, and rolled rapidly over each other down the incline. I\r\nknew that some precipices were in advance of us, over which we should\r\nhave gone, so, releasing myself from my companion, I threw myself in\r\nfront of him, stopped myself with my axe, and thus placed a barrier\r\nbefore him.\" After some vain efforts at sliding down the slopes on a\r\nbaton, in which practice I was fairly beaten by some of my new friends,\r\nI attached myself to the invalid, and walked with him and Lauener\r\nhomewards. Had I gone forward with the foremost of the party, I should\r\nhave completed the expedition to the summit and back in a little better\r\nthan nine hours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DANGER OF CLIMBING ALONE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI think it right to say one earnest word in connexion with this ascent;\r\nand the more so as I believe a notion is growing prevalent that half\r\nwhat is said and written about the dangers of the Alps is mere humbug.\r\nNo doubt exaggeration is not rare, but I would emphatically warn my\r\nreaders against acting upon the supposition that it is general. The\r\ndangers of Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa, and other mountains, are real, and,\r\nif not properly provided against, may be terrible. I have been much\r\naccustomed to be alone upon the glaciers, but sometimes, even when a\r\nguide was in front of me, I have felt an extreme longing to have a\r\nsecond one behind me. Less than two good ones I think an arduous climber\r\nought not to have; and if climbing without guides were to become\r\nhabitual, deplorable consequences would assuredly sooner or later ensue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(23.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 18th of August I spent upon the Furgge glacier at the base of Mont\r\nCervin, and what it taught me shall be stated in another place. The\r\nevening of this day was signalised by the pleasant acquaintances which\r\nit gave me. It was my intention to cross the Weissthor on the morning of\r\nthe 19th, but thunder, lightning, and heavy rain opposed the project,\r\nand with two friends I descended, amid pitiless rain, to Zermatt. Next\r\nday I walked by way of Stalden to Saas, where I made the acquaintance of\r\nHerr Imseng, the Cure, and on the 21st ascended to the Distel Alp. Near\r\nto this place the Allalein glacier pushes its huge terminus right across\r\nthe valley and dams up the streams descending from the mountains higher\r\nup, thus giving birth to a dismal lake. At one end of this stands the\r\nMattmark hotel, which was to be my headquarters for a few days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASCENT OF A BOULDER. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI reached the place in good company. Near to the hotel are two\r\nmagnificent boulders of green serpentine, which have been lodged there\r\nby one of the lateral glaciers; and two of the ladies desiring to ascend\r\none of these rocks, a friend and myself helped them to the top. The\r\nthing was accomplished in a very spirited way. Indeed the general\r\ncontrast, in regard to energy, between the maidens of the British Isles\r\nand those of the Continent and of America is extraordinary. Surely those\r\nwho talk of this country being in its old age overlook the physical\r\nvigour of its sons and daughters. They are strong, but from a\r\ncombination of the greatest forces we may obtain a small resultant,\r\nbecause the forces may act in opposite directions and partly neutralize\r\neach other. Herein, in fact, lies Britain's weakness; it is strength\r\nill-directed; and is indicative rather of the perversity of young blood\r\nthan of the precision of mature years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISMAL QUARTERS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nImmediately after this achievement I was forsaken by my friends, and\r\nremained the only visitor in the hotel. A dense gray cloud gradually\r\nfilled the entire atmosphere, from which the rain at length began to\r\ngush in torrents. The scene from the windows of the hotel was of the\r\nmost dismal character; the rain also came through the roof, and dripped\r\nfrom the ceiling to the floor. I endeavoured to make a fire, but the air\r\nwould not let the smoke of the pine-logs ascend, and the biting of the\r\nhydrocarbons was excruciating to the eyes. On the whole, the cold was\r\npreferable to the smoke. During the night the rain changed to snow, and\r\non the morning of the 22nd all the mountains were thickly covered. The\r\ngray delta through which a river of many arms ran into the Mattmark See\r\nwas hidden; against some of the windows of the _salle a manger_ the snow\r\nwas also piled, obscuring more than half their light. I had sent my\r\nguide to Visp, and two women and myself were the only occupants of the\r\nplace. It was extremely desolate--I felt, moreover, the chill of Monte\r\nRosa in my throat, and the conditions were not favourable to the cure of\r\na cold.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd the Allalein glacier was unfit for work; I therefore\r\nascended to the summit of the Monte Moro, and found the Valaisian side\r\nof the pass in clear sunshine, while impenetrable fog met us on the\r\nItalian side. I examined the colour of the freshly fallen snow; it was\r\nnot an ordinary blue, and was even more transparent than the blue of the\r\nfirmament. When the snow was broken the light flashed forth; when the\r\nstaff was dug into the snow and withdrawn, the blue gleam appeared; when\r\nthe staff lay in a hole, although there might be a sufficient space all\r\nround it, the coloured light refused to show itself.\r\n\r\nMy cough kept me awake on the night of the 23rd, and my cold was worse\r\nnext day. I went upon the Allalein glacier, but found myself by no means\r\nso sure a climber as usual. The best guides find that their powers vary;\r\nthey are not equally competent on all days. I have heard a celebrated\r\nChamouni guide assert that a man's _morale_ is different on different\r\ndays. The morale in my case had a physical basis, and it probably has so\r\nin all. The Allalein glacier, as I have said, crosses the valley and\r\nabuts against the opposite mountain; here it is forced to turn aside,\r\nand in consequence of the thrust and bending it is crumpled and\r\ncrevassed. The wall of the Mattmark See is a fine glacier section:\r\nlooked at from a distance, the ridges and fissures appear arranged like\r\na fan. The structure of the crumpled ice varies from the vertical to the\r\nhorizontal, and the ridges are sometimes split _along_ the planes of\r\nstructure. The aspect of this portion of the glacier from some of the\r\nadjacent heights is exceedingly interesting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE VAULT OF THE ALLALEIN. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 25th I had two hours' clambering over the\r\nmountains before breakfast, and traced the action of ancient glaciers to\r\na great height. The valley of Saas in this respect rivals that of Hasli;\r\nthe flutings and polishings being on the grandest scale. After breakfast\r\nI went to the end of the Allalein glacier, where the Saas Visp river\r\nrushes from it: the vault was exceedingly fine, being composed of\r\nconcentric arches of clear blue ice. I spent several hours here\r\nexamining the intimate structure of the ice, and found the vacuum disks\r\nwhich I shall describe at another place, of the greatest service to me.\r\nAs at Rosenlaui and elsewhere, they here taught me that the glacier was\r\ncomposed of an aggregate of small fragments, each of which had a\r\ndefinite plane of crystallization. Where the ice was partially weathered\r\nthe surfaces of division between the fragments could be traced through\r\nthe coherent mass, but on crossing these surfaces the direction of the\r\nvacuum disks changed, indicating a similar change of the planes of\r\ncrystallization. The blue veins of the glacier went through its\r\ncomponent fragments irrespective of these planes. Sometimes the vacuum\r\ndisks were parallel to the veins, sometimes across them, sometimes\r\noblique to them.\r\n\r\nSeveral fine masses of ice had fallen from the arch upon its floor, and\r\nthese were disintegrated to the core. A kick, or a stroke of an axe,\r\nsufficed to shake masses almost a cubic yard in size into fragments\r\nvarying not much on either side of a cubic inch. The veining was finely\r\npreserved on the concentric arches of the vault, and some of them\r\napparently exhibited its abolition, or at least confusion, and fresh\r\ndevelopment by new conditions of pressure. The river being deep and\r\nturbulent this day, to reach its opposite side I had to climb the\r\nglacier and cross over the crown of its highest arch; this enabled me\r\nto get quite in front of the vault, to enter it, and closely inspect\r\nthose portions where the structure appeared to change. I afterwards\r\nascended the steep moraine which lies between the Allalein and the\r\nsmaller glacier to the left of it; passing to the latter at intervals to\r\nexamine its structure. I was at length stopped by the dislocated ice;\r\nand from the heights I could count a system of seven dirt-bands, formed\r\nby the undulations on the surface of the glacier. On my return to the\r\nhotel I found there a number of well-known Alpine men who intended to\r\ncross the Adler pass on the following day. Herr Imseng was there: he\r\ncame to me full of enthusiasm, and asked me whether I would join him in\r\nan ascent of the Dom: we might immediately attack it; and he felt sure\r\nthat we should succeed. The Dom is the highest of the Mischabel peaks,\r\nand is one of the grandest of the Alps. I agreed to join the Cure, and\r\nwith this understanding we parted for the night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AVALANCHE AT SAAS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 26th August.--A wild stormy morning after a wild and rainy\r\nnight: the Adler pass being impassable, the mountaineers returned, and\r\nImseng informed me that the Dom must be abandoned. He gave me the\r\nstatistics of an avalanche which had fallen in the valley some years\r\nbefore. Within the memory of man Saas had never been touched by an\r\navalanche, but a tradition existed that such a catastrophe had once\r\noccurred. On the 14th of March, 1848, at eight o'clock in the morning,\r\nthe Cure was in his room; when he heard the cracking of pine-branches,\r\nand inferred from the sound that an avalanche was descending upon the\r\nvillage. It dashed in the windows of his house and filled his rooms with\r\nsnow; the sound it produced being sufficient to mask the crashing of the\r\ntimbers of an adjacent house. Three persons were killed. On the 3rd of\r\nApril, 1849, heavy snow fell at Saas; the Cure waited until it had\r\nattained a depth of four feet, and then retreated to Fee. That night an\r\navalanche descended, and in the line of its rush was a house in which\r\nfive or six and twenty people had collected for safety: nineteen of them\r\nwere killed. The Cure afterwards showed me the site of the house, and\r\nthe direction of the avalanche. It passed through a pine wood; and on\r\nexpressing my surprise that the trees did not arrest it, he replied that\r\nthe snow was \"quite like dust,\" and rushed among the trees like so much\r\nwater. To return from Fee to Saas on the day following he found it\r\nnecessary to carry two planks. Kneeling upon one of them, he pushed the\r\nother forward, and transferred his weight to it, drawing the other after\r\nhim and repeating the same act. The snow was like flour, and would not\r\notherwise bear his weight. Seeing no prospect of fine weather, I\r\ndescended to Saas on the afternoon of the 26th. I was the only guest at\r\nthe hotel; but during the evening I was gratified by the unexpected\r\narrival of my friend Hirst, who was on his way over the Monte Moro to\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FEE GLACIER. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SNOW, VAPOUR AND CLOUD. 1858.]\r\n\r\nFor the last five days it had been a struggle between the north wind and\r\nthe south, each edging the other by turns out of its atmospheric bed,\r\nand producing copious precipitation; but now the conflict was\r\ndecided--the north had prevailed, and an almost unclouded heaven\r\noverspread the Alps. The few white fleecy masses that remained were good\r\nindications of the swift march of the wind in the upper air. My friend\r\nand I resolved to have at least one day's excursion together, and we\r\nchose for it the glacier of the Fee. Ascending the mountain by a\r\nwell-beaten path, we passed a number of \"Calvaries\" filled with tattered\r\nsaints and Virgins, and soon came upon the rim of a flattened bowl quite\r\nclasped by the mountains. In its centre was the little hamlet of Fee,\r\nround which were fresh green pastures, and beyond it the perpetual ice\r\nand snow. It was exceedingly picturesque--a scene of human beauty and\r\nindustry where savagery alone was to be expected. The basin had been\r\nscooped by glaciers, and as we paused at its entrance the rounded and\r\nfluted rocks were beneath our feet. The Alphubel and the Mischabel\r\nraised their crowns to heaven in front of us; the newly fallen snow\r\nclung where it could to the precipitous crags of the Mischabel, but on\r\nthe summits it was the sport of the wind. Sometimes it was borne\r\nstraight upwards in long vertical striae; sometimes the fibrous columns\r\nswayed to the right, sometimes to the left; sometimes the motion on one\r\nof the summits would quite subside; anon the white peak would appear\r\nsuddenly to shake itself to dust, which it yielded freely to the wind. I\r\ncould see the wafted snow gradually melt away, and again curdle up into\r\ntrue white cloud by precipitation; this in its turn would be pulled\r\nasunder like carded wool, and reduced a second time to transparent\r\nvapour.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the ice of the Fee stands a green alp, not unlike the\r\nJardin; up this we climbed, halting at intervals upon its grassy knolls\r\nto inspect the glacier. I aimed at those places where on a priori\r\ngrounds I should have thought the production of the veined structure\r\nmost likely, and reached at length the base of a wall of rock from the\r\nedge of which long spears of ice depended. Here my friend halted, while\r\nLauener and myself climbed the precipice, and ascended to the summit of\r\nthe alp. The snow was deep at many places, and our immersions in unseen\r\nholes very frequent. From the peak of the Fee Alp a most glorious view\r\nis obtained; in point of grandeur it will bear comparison with any in\r\nthe Alps, and its seclusion gives it an inexpressible charm. We remained\r\nfor half an hour upon the warm rock, and then descended. It was our\r\nhabit to jump from the higher ledges into the deep snow below them, in\r\nwhich we wallowed as if it were flour; but on one of these occasions I\r\nlighted on a stone, and the shock produced a curious effect upon my\r\nhearing. I appeared suddenly to lose the power of appreciating deep\r\nsounds, while the shriller ones were comparatively unimpaired. After I\r\nrejoined my friend it required attention on my part to hear him when he\r\nspoke to me. This continued until I approached the end of the glacier,\r\nwhen suddenly the babblement of streams, and a world of sounds to which\r\nI had been before quite deaf burst in upon me. The deafness was probably\r\ndue to a strain of the tympanum, such as we can produce artificially,\r\nand thus quench low sounds, while shrill ones are scarcely affected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"A TERRIBLE HOLE.\" 1858.]\r\n\r\nI was anxious to quit Saas early next morning, but the Cure expressed so\r\nstrong a wish to show us what he called a _schauderhaftes Loch_--a\r\nterrible hole--which he had himself discovered, that I consented to\r\naccompany him. We were joined by his assistant and the priest of Fee.\r\nThe stream from the Fee glacier has cut a deep channel through the\r\nrocks, and along the right-hand bank of the stream we ascended. It was\r\nvery rough with fallen crags and fallen pines amid which we once or\r\ntwice lost our way. At length we came to an aperture just sufficient to\r\nlet a man's body through, and were informed by our conductor that our\r\nroute lay along the little tunnel: he lay down upon his stomach and\r\nsqueezed himself through it like a marmot. I followed him; a second\r\ntunnel, in which, however, we could stand upright, led into a spacious\r\ncavern, formed by the falling together of immense slabs of rock which\r\nabutted against each other so as to form a roof. It was the very type of\r\na robber den; and when I remarked this, it was at once proposed to sing\r\na verse from Schiller's play. The young priest had a powerful voice--he\r\nled and we all chimed in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SONG OF THE ROBBERS. 1858.]\r\n\r\n  \"Ein frohes Leben fuehren wir,\r\n  Ein Leben voller Wonne.\r\n  Der Wald ist unser Nachtquartier,\r\n  Bei Sturm und Wind hanthieren wir,\r\n  Der Mond ist unsre Sonne.\"\r\n\r\nHerr Imseng wore his black coat; the others had taken theirs off, but\r\nthey wore their clerical hats, black breeches and stockings. We formed a\r\nsingular group in a singular place, and the echoed voices mingled\r\nstrangely with the gusts of the wind and the rush of the river.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards I parted from my friend, and descended the valley to\r\nVisp, where I also parted with my guide. He had been with me from the\r\n22nd of July to the 29th of August, and did his duty entirely to my\r\nsatisfaction. He is an excellent iceman, and is well acquainted both\r\nwith the glaciers of the Oberland and of the Valais. He is strong and\r\ngood-humoured, and were I to make another expedition of the kind I don't\r\nthink that I should take any guide in the Oberland in preference to\r\nChristian Lauener.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(24.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLIMBERS AND SCIENCE. 1858.]\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that as yet we know absolutely nothing of the\r\nwinter temperature of any one of the high Alpine summits. No doubt it is\r\na sufficient justification of our Alpine men, as regards their climbing,\r\n_that they like it_. This plain reason is enough; and no man who ever\r\nascended that \"bad eminence\" Primrose Hill, or climbed to Hampstead\r\nHeath for the sake of a freer horizon, can consistently ask a better. As\r\nregards physical science, however, the contributions of our mountaineers\r\nhave as yet been _nil_, and hence, when we hear of the scientific value\r\nof their doings, it is simply amusing to the climbers themselves. I do\r\nnot fear that I shall offend them in the least by my frankness in\r\nstating this. Their pleasure is that of overcoming acknowledged\r\ndifficulties, and of witnessing natural grandeur. But I would venture to\r\nurge that our Alpine men will not find their pleasure lessened by\r\nembracing a scientific object in their doings. They have the strength,\r\nthe intelligence, and let them add to these the accuracy which physical\r\nscience now demands, and they may contribute work of enduring value. Mr.\r\nCasella will gladly teach them the use of his minimum-thermometers; and\r\nI trust that the next seven years will not pass without making us\r\nacquainted with the winter temperature of every mountain of note in\r\nSwitzerland.[A]\r\n\r\nI had thought of this subject since I first read the conjectures of De\r\nSaussure on the temperature of Mont Blanc; but in 1857 I met Auguste\r\nBalmat at the Jardin, and there learned from him that he entertained the\r\nidea of placing a self-registering thermometer at the summit of the\r\nmountain. Balmat was personally a stranger to me at the time, but\r\nProfessor Forbes's writings had inspired me with a respect for him,\r\nwhich this unprompted idea of his augmented. He had procured a\r\nthermometer, the graduation of which, however, he feared was not low\r\nenough. As an encouragement to Balmat, and with the view of making his\r\nlaudable intentions known, I communicated them to the Royal Society, and\r\nobtained from the Council a small grant of money to purchase\r\nthermometers and to assist in the expenses of an ascent. I had now the\r\nthermometers in my possession; and having completed my work at Zermatt\r\nand Saas, my next desire was to reach Chamouni and place the instruments\r\non the top of Mont Blanc. I accordingly descended the valley of the\r\nRhone to Martigny, crossed the Tete Noire, and arrived at Chamouni on\r\nthe 29th of August, 1858.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFICULTIES AT CHAMOUNI. 1858.]\r\n\r\nBalmat was engaged at this time as the guide of Mr. Alfred Wills, who,\r\nhowever, kindly offered to place him at my disposal; and also expressed\r\na desire to accompany me himself and assist me in my observations. I\r\ngladly accepted a proposal which gave me for companion so determined a\r\nclimber and so estimable a man. But Chamouni was rife with difficulties.\r\nIn 1857 the Guide Chef had the good sense to give me considerable\r\nliberty of action. Now his mood was entirely changed: he had been\r\n\"molested\" for giving me so much freedom. I wished to have a boy to\r\ncarry a small instrument for me up the Mer de Glace--he would not allow\r\nit; I must take a guide. If I ascended Mont Blanc he declared that I\r\nmust take four guides; that, in short, I must in all respects conform to\r\nthe rules made for ordinary tourists. I endeavoured to explain to him\r\nthe advantages which Chamouni had derived from the labours of men of\r\nscience; it was such men who had discovered it when it was unknown, and\r\nit was by their writings that the attention of the general public had\r\nbeen called towards it. It was a bad recompense, I urged, to treat a man\r\nof science as he was treating me. This was urged in vain; he shrugged\r\nhis shoulders, was very sorry, but the thing could not be changed. I\r\nthen requested to know his superior, that I might apply to him; he\r\ninformed me that there were a President and Commission of guides at\r\nChamouni, who were the proper persons to decide the question, and he\r\nproposed to call them together on the 31st of August, at seven P.M., on\r\ncondition that I was to be present to state my own case. To this I\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nI spent that day quite alone upon the Mer de Glace, and climbed amid a\r\nheavy snow-storm to the Cleft station over Trelaporte. When I reached\r\nthe Montanvert I was wet and weary, and would have spent the night there\r\nwere it not for my engagement with the Guide Chef. I descended amid the\r\nrain, and at the appointed hour went to his bureau. He met me with a\r\npolite sympathetic shrug; explained to me that he had spoken to the\r\nCommission, but that it could not assemble _pour une chose comma ca_;\r\nthat the rules were fixed, and I must abide by them. \"Well,\" I\r\nresponded, \"you think you have done your duty; it is now my turn to\r\nperform mine. If no other means are available I will have this\r\ntransaction communicated to the Sardinian Government, and I don't think\r\nthat it will ratify what you have done.\" The Guide Chef evidently did\r\nnot believe a word of it.\r\n\r\nPrevious to taking any further step I thought it right to see the\r\nPresident of the Commission of Guides, who was also Syndic of the\r\ncommune. I called upon him on the morning of the 1st of September, and,\r\nassuming that he knew all about the transaction, spoke to him\r\naccordingly. He listened to me for a time, but did not seem to\r\nunderstand me, which I ascribed partly to my defective French\r\npronunciation. I expressed a hope that he did comprehend me; he said\r\nhe understood my words very well, but did not know their purport. In\r\nfact he had not heard a single word about me or my request. He stated\r\nwith some indignation that, so far from its being a subject on which the\r\nCommission could not assemble, it was one which it was their especial\r\nduty to take into consideration. Our conference ended with the\r\narrangement that I was to write him an official letter stating the case,\r\nwhich he was to forward to the Intendant of the province of Faucigny\r\nresident at Bonneville. All this was done.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE INTENDANT MEMORIALISED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI subsequently memorialised the Intendant himself; and Balmat visited\r\nhim to secure his permission to accompany me. I have to record, that\r\nfrom first to last the Intendant gave me his sympathy and support. He\r\ncould not alter laws, but he deprecated a \"judaical\" interpretation of\r\nthem. His final letter to myself was as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE INTENDANT'S RESPONSE. 1858.]\r\n\r\n                    \"Intendance Royale de la Province de Faucigny,\r\n                    \"Bonneville, 11 Septembre, 1858.\r\n\r\n     \"Monsieur,--\r\n\r\n     \"J'apprends avec une veritable peine les difficultes que vous\r\n     rencontrez de la part de M. le Guide Chef pour l'effectuation\r\n     de votre perilleuse entreprise scientifique, mais je dois vous\r\n     dire aussi avec regret que ces difficultes resident dans un\r\n     reglement fait en vue de la securite des voyageurs, quel que\r\n     puisse etre le but de leurs excursions.\r\n\r\n     \"Desireux neanmoins de vous etre utile, notamment en la\r\n     circonstance, j'invite aujourd'hui meme M. le Guide Chef a\r\n     avoir egard a votre projet, a faire en sa faveur une exception\r\n     au reglement ci-devant eu, tant qu'il n'y aura aucun danger\r\n     pour votre surete et celle des personnes qui vous\r\n     accompagneront, et enfin de se preter dans les limites de ses\r\n     moyens et attributions pour l'heureux succes de l'expedition,\r\n     dont les consequences et resultats n'interessent pas seulement\r\n     la science, mais encore la vallee de Chamounix en particulier.\r\n\r\n                    \"Agreez, Monsieur,\r\n                    \"l'assurance de ma consideration tres-distinguee.\r\n                    \"Pour l'Intendant en conge,\r\n                    \"Le Secretaire,\r\n                    \"DELEGLISE.\"\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for this permission I employed myself in various ways. On\r\nthe 2nd of September I ascended the Brevent, from which Mont Blanc is\r\nseen to great advantage. From Chamouni its vast slopes are so\r\nforeshortened that one gets a very imperfect idea of the extent to be\r\ntraversed to reach the summit. What, however, struck me most on the\r\nBrevent was the changed relation of the Aiguille du Dru and the Aiguille\r\nVerte. From Montanvert the former appears a most imposing mass, while\r\nthe peak of the latter appears rather dwarfed behind it; but from the\r\nBrevent the Aiguille du Dru is a mere pinnacle stuck in the breast of\r\nthe grander pyramid of the Aiguille Verte.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE \"SERACS\" REVISITED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th I rose early, and, strapping on my telescope, ascended to the\r\nMontanvert, where I engaged a youth to accompany me up the glacier. The\r\nheavens were clear and beautiful:--blue over the Aiguille du Dru, blue\r\nover the Jorasse and Mont Mallet, deep blue over the pinnacles of\r\nCharmoz, and the same splendid tint stretched grandly over the Col du\r\nGeant and its Aiguille. No trace of condensation appeared till towards\r\neleven o'clock, when a little black balloon of cloud swung itself over\r\nthe Aiguilles Rouges. At one o'clock there were two large masses and a\r\nlittle one between them; while higher up a white veil, almost too thin\r\nto be visible, spread over a part of the heavens. At the zenith,\r\nhowever, and south, north, and west, the blue seemed to deepen as the\r\nday advanced. I visited the ice-wall at the Tacul, which seemed lower\r\nthan it was last year; the cascade of le Geant appeared also far less\r\nimposing. Only in the early part of summer do we see the ice in its true\r\ngrandeur: its edges and surfaces are then sharp and clear, but\r\nafterwards its nobler masses shrink under the influence of sun and air.\r\nThe _seracs_ now appeared wasted and dirty, and not the sharp angular\r\nice-castles which rose so grandly when I first saw them. Thirteen men\r\nhad crossed the Col du Geant on the day previous, and left an ample\r\ntrace behind them. This I followed nearly to the summit of the fall. The\r\ncondition of the glacier was totally different from that of the opposite\r\nside on the previous year. The ice was riven, burrowed, and honeycombed,\r\nbut the track amid all was easy: a vigorous English maiden might have\r\nascended the fall without much difficulty. My object now was to examine\r\nthe structure of the fall; but the ice was not in a good condition for\r\nsuch an examination: it was too much broken. Still a definite structure\r\nwas in many places to be traced, and some of them apparently showed\r\nstructure and bedding at a high angle to each other, but I could not be\r\ncertain of it. I paused at every commanding point of view and examined\r\nthe ice through my opera-glass; but the result was inconclusive. I\r\nobserved that the terraces which compose the fall do not front the\r\nmiddle of the glacier, but turn their foreheads rather towards its\r\neastern side, and the consequence is that the protuberances lower down,\r\nwhich are the remains of these terraces, are highest at the same side.\r\nStanding at the base of the Aiguille Noire, and looking downwards where\r\nthe Glacier des Periades pushes itself against the Geant, a series of\r\nfine crumples is formed on the former, cut across by crevasses, on the\r\nwalls of which a forward and backward dipping of the blue veins is\r\nexhibited. Huge crumples are also formed by the Glacier du Geant, which\r\nare well seen from a point nearly opposite the lowest lateral moraine of\r\nthe Glacier des Periades. In some cases the upper portions of the\r\ncrumples had scaled off so as to form arches of ice--a consequence\r\ndoubtless of the pressure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THERMOMETER AT THE JARDIN. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe beauty of some Alpine skies is treacherous; in fact the deepest blue\r\noften indicates an atmosphere charged almost to saturation with aqueous\r\nvapour. This was the case on the present occasion. Soon after reaching\r\nChamouni in the evening, rain commenced and continued with scarcely any\r\nintermission until the afternoon of the 8th. I had given up all hopes of\r\nbeing able to ascend Mont Blanc; and hence resolved to place the\r\nthermometers in some more accessible position. On the 9th accordingly,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Wills, Balmat, and some other friends, I ascended to\r\nthe summit of the Jardin, where we placed two thermometers: one in the\r\nice, at a depth of three feet below the surface; another on a ledge of\r\nthe highest rock.[B] The boiling point of water at this place was\r\n194.6 deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\nDeep snow was upon the Talefre, and the surrounding precipices were also\r\nheavily laden. Avalanches thundered incessantly from the Aiguille Verte\r\nand the other mountains. Scarcely five minutes on an average intervened\r\nbetween every two successive peals; and after the direct shock of each\r\navalanche had died away the air of the basin continued to be shaken by\r\nthe echoes reflected from its bounding walls.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EVENING RED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe day was far spent before we had completed our work. All through the\r\nweather had been fine, and towards evening augmented to magnificence. As\r\nwe descended the glacier from the Couvercle the sun was just\r\ndisappearing, and the western heaven glowed with crimson, which crept\r\ngradually up the sky until finally it reached the zenith itself. Such\r\nintensity of colouring is exceedingly rare in the Alps; and this fact,\r\ntogether with the known variations in the intensity of the firmamental\r\nblue, justify the conclusion that the colouring must, in a great\r\nmeasure, be due to some _variable constituent_ of the atmosphere. If\r\n_the air_ were competent to produce these magnificent effects they would\r\nbe the rule instead of the exception.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FINISHED WORK. 1858.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the thermometers been thus disposed of than the weather\r\nappeared to undergo a permanent change. On the 10th it was perfectly\r\nfine--not the slightest mist upon Mont Blanc; on the 11th this was also\r\nthe case. Balmat still had the old thermometer to which I have already\r\nreferred; it might not do to show the minimum temperature of the air,\r\nbut it might show the temperature at a certain depth below the surface.\r\nI find in my own case that the finishing of work has a great moral\r\nvalue: work completed is a safe fulcrum for the performance of other\r\nwork; and even though in the course of our labours experience should\r\nshow us a better means of accomplishing a given end, it is often far\r\npreferable to reach the end, even by defective means, than to swerve\r\nfrom our course. The habits which this conviction had superinduced no\r\ndoubt influenced me when I decided on placing Balmat's thermometer on\r\nthe summit of Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] I find with pleasure that my friend Mr. John Ball is now exerting\r\nhimself in this direction.\r\n\r\n[B] The minimum temperature of the subsequent winter, as shown by this\r\nthermometer, was -6 deg. Fahr., or 38 deg. below the freezing point. The\r\ninstrument placed in the ice was broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ASCENT OF MONT BLANC, 1858.\r\n\r\n(25.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHADOWS OF THE AIGUILLES. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of September, at 5-1/2 A.M. the sunbeams had already fallen\r\nupon the mountain; but though the sky above him, and over the entire\r\nrange of the Aiguilles, was without a cloud, the atmosphere presented an\r\nappearance of turbidity resembling that produced by the dust and thin\r\nsmoke mechanically suspended in a London atmosphere on a dry summer's\r\nday. At 20 minutes past 7 we quitted Chamouni, bearing with us the good\r\nwishes of a portion of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTERFERENCE-SPECTRA. 1858.]\r\n\r\nA lady accompanied us on horseback to the point where the path to the\r\nGrands Mulets deviates from that to the Plan des Aiguilles; here she\r\nturned to the left, and we proceeded slowly upwards, through woods of\r\npine, hung with fantastic lichens: escaping from the gloom of these, we\r\nemerged upon slopes of bosky underwood, green hazel, and green larch,\r\nwith the red berries of the mountain-ash shining brightly between them.\r\nThrough the air above us, like gnomons of a vast sundial, the Aiguilles\r\ncast their fanlike shadows, which moved round as the day advanced.\r\nSlopes of rhododendrons with withered flowers next succeeded, but the\r\ncolouring of the bilberry-leaves was scarcely less exquisite than the\r\nfreshest bloom of the Alpine rose. For a long time we were in the cool\r\nshadow of the mountain, catching, at intervals, through the twigs in\r\nfront of us, glimpses of the sun surrounded by coloured spectra. On one\r\noccasion a brow rose in front of me; behind it was a lustrous space of\r\nheaven, adjacent to the sun, which, however, was hidden behind the brow;\r\nagainst this space the twigs and weeds upon the summit of the brow shone\r\nas if they were self-luminous, while some bits of thistle-down floating\r\nin the air appeared, where they crossed this portion of the heavens,\r\nlike fragments of the sun himself. Once the orb appeared behind a\r\nrounded mass of snow which lay near the summit of the Aiguille du Midi.\r\nLooked at with the naked eyes, it seemed to possess a billowy motion,\r\nthe light darting from it in dazzling curves,--a subjective effect\r\nproduced by the abnormal action of the intense light upon the eye. As\r\nthe sun's disk came more into view, its rays however still grazing the\r\nsummit of the mountain, interference-spectra darted from it on all\r\nsides, and surrounded it with a glory of richly-coloured bars. Mingling\r\nhowever with the grandeur of nature, we had the anger and obstinacy of\r\nman. With a view to subsequent legal proceedings, the Guide Chef sent a\r\nspy after us, who, having satisfied himself of our delinquency, took his\r\nunpleasant presence from the splendid scene.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, though the luminous appearance of bodies projected\r\nagainst the sky adjacent to the rising sun is a most striking and\r\nbeautiful phenomenon, it is hardly ever seen by either guides or\r\ntravellers; probably because they avoid looking towards a sky the\r\nbrightness of which is painful to the eyes. In 1859 Auguste Balmat had\r\nnever seen the effect; and the only written description of it which we\r\npossess is one furnished by Professor Necker, in a letter to Sir David\r\nBrewster, which is so interesting that I do not hesitate to reproduce it\r\nhere:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROFESSOR NECKER'S LETTER. 1858.]\r\n\r\n\"I now come to the point,\" writes M. Necker, \"which you particularly\r\nwished me to describe to you; I mean the luminous appearance of trees,\r\nshrubs, and birds, when seen from the foot of a mountain a little before\r\nsunrise. The wish I had to see again the phenomenon before attempting to\r\ndescribe it made me detain this letter a few days, till I had a fine day\r\nto go to see it at the Mont Saleve; so yesterday I went there, and\r\nstudied the fact, and in elucidation of it I made a little drawing, of\r\nwhich I give you here a copy: it will, with the explanation and the\r\nannexed diagram (Fig. 9), impart to you, I hope, a correct idea of the\r\nphenomenon. You must conceive the observer placed at the foot of a hill\r\ninterposed between him and the place where the sun is rising, and thus\r\nentirely in the shade; the upper margin of the mountain is covered with\r\nwoods or detached trees and shrubs, which are projected as dark objects\r\non a very bright and clear sky, except at the very place where the sun\r\nis just going to rise, for there all the trees and shrubs bordering the\r\nmargin are entirely,--branches, leaves, stem and all,--of a pure and\r\nbrilliant white, appearing extremely bright and luminous, although\r\nprojected on a most brilliant and luminous sky, as that part of it which\r\nsurrounds the sun always is. All the minutest details, leaves, twigs,\r\n&c., are most delicately preserved, and you would fancy you saw these\r\ntrees and forests made of the purest silver, with all the skill of the\r\nmost expert workman. The swallows and other birds flying in those\r\nparticular spots appear like sparks of the most brilliant white.\r\nUnfortunately, all these details, which add so much to the beauty of\r\nthis splendid phenomenon, cannot be represented in such small sketches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Luminous Trees projected against the sky at\r\nsunrise.]\r\n\r\n\"Neither the hour of the day nor the angle which the object makes with\r\nthe observer appears to have any effect; for on some occasions I have\r\nseen the phenomenon take place at a very early hour in the morning.\r\nYesterday it was 10 A.M., when I saw it as represented in Fig. 10. I saw\r\nit again on the same day at 5 P.M., at a different place of the same\r\nmountain, for which the sun was just setting. At one time the angle of\r\nelevation of the lighted white shrubs above the horizon of the spectator\r\nwas about 20 deg., while at another place it was only 15 deg. But the\r\nextent of the field of illumination is variable, according to the distance\r\nat which the spectator is placed from it. When the object behind which the\r\nsun is just going to rise, or has just been setting, is very near, no\r\nsuch effect takes place. In the case represented in Fig. 9 the distance\r\nwas about 194 metres, or 636 English feet, from the spectator in a\r\ndirect line, the height above his level being 60 metres, or 197 English\r\nfeet, and the horizontal line drawn from him to the horizontal\r\nprojection of these points on the plane of his horizon being 160 metres,\r\nor 525 English feet, as will be seen in the following diagram, Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SILVER TREES AT SUNRISE. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Luminous Trees projected against the sky at\r\nsunrise.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BIRDS AS SPARKS OR STARS. 1858.]\r\n\r\n\"In this case only small shrubs and the lower half of the stem of a tree\r\nare illuminated white, and the horizontal extent of this effect is also\r\ncomparatively small; while at other places when I was near the edge\r\nbehind which the sun was going to rise no such effect took place. But on\r\nthe contrary, when I have witnessed the phenomenon at a greater distance\r\nand at a greater height, as I have seen it other times on the same and\r\non other mountains of the Alps, large tracts of forests and immense\r\nspruce-firs were illuminated white throughout their whole length, as I\r\nhave attempted to represent in Fig. 11, and the corresponding diagram,\r\nFig. 12. Nothing can be finer than these silver-looking spruce-forests.\r\nAt the same time, though at a distance of more than a thousand metres, a\r\nvast number of large swallows or swifts (_Cypselus alpinus_), which\r\ninhabit these high rocks, were seen as small brilliant stars or sparks\r\nmoving rapidly in the air. From these facts it appears to me obvious\r\nthat the extent of the illuminated spots varies in a direct ratio of\r\ntheir distance; but at the same time that there must be a constant\r\nangular space, corresponding probably to the zone, a few minutes of a\r\ndegree wide, around the sun's disk, which is a limit to the occurrence\r\nof the appearance. This would explain how the real extent which it\r\noccupies on the earth's surface varies with the relative distance of the\r\nspot from the eye of the observer, and accounts also for the phenomenon\r\nbeing never seen in the low country, where I have often looked for it in\r\nvain. Now that you are acquainted with the circumstances of the fact, I\r\nhave no doubt you will easily observe it in some part or other of your\r\nScotch hills; it may be some long heather or furze will play the part\r\nof our Alpine forests, and I would advise you to try and place a\r\nbee-hive in the required position, and it would perfectly represent our\r\nswallows, sparks, and stars.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Luminous Trees projected against the sky at\r\nsunrise.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Luminous Trees projected against the sky at\r\nsunrise.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LADDER CONDEMNED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOur porters, with one exception, reached the Pierre a l'Echelle as soon\r\nas ourselves; and here having refreshed themselves, and the due exchange\r\nof loads having been made, we advanced upon the glacier, which we\r\ncrossed, until we came nearly opposite to the base of the Grands Mulets.\r\nThe existence of one wide crevasse, which was deemed impassable, had\r\nthis year introduced the practice of assailing the rocks at their base,\r\nand climbing them to the cabin, an operation which Balmat wished to\r\navoid. At Chamouni, therefore, he had made inquiries regarding the width\r\nof the chasm, and acting on his advice I had had a ladder constructed in\r\ntwo pieces, which, united together by iron attachments, was supposed to\r\nbe of sufficient length to span the fissure. On reaching the latter, the\r\npieces were united, and the ladder thrown across, but the bridge was so\r\nfrail and shaky at the place of junction, and the chasm so deep, that\r\nBalmat pronounced the passage impracticable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CROSSING CREVASSES. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe porters were all grouped beside the crevasse when this announcement\r\nwas made, and, like hounds in search of the scent, the group instantly\r\nbroke up, seeking in all directions for a means of passage. The talk was\r\nincessant and animating; attention was now called in one direction, anon\r\nin another, the men meanwhile throwing themselves into the most\r\npicturesque groups and attitudes. All eyes at length were directed upon\r\na fissure which was spanned at one point by an arch of snow, certainly\r\nunder two feet deep at the crown. A stout rope was tied round the waist\r\nof one of our porters, and he was sent forward to test the bridge. He\r\napproached it cautiously, treading down the snow to give it compactness,\r\nand thus make his footing sure as he advanced; bringing regelation into\r\nplay, he gave the mass the necessary continuity, and crossed in safety.\r\nThe rope was subsequently stretched over the _pont_, and each of us\r\ncausing his right hand to slide along it, followed without accident.\r\nSoon afterwards, however, we met with a second and very formidable\r\ncrevasse, to cross which we had but half of our ladder, which was\r\napplied as follows:--The side of the fissure on which we stood was lower\r\nthan the opposite one; over the edge of the latter projected a cornice\r\nof snow, and a ledge of the same material jutted from the wall of the\r\ncrevasse, a little below us. The ladder was placed from ledge to\r\ncornice, both of its ends being supported by snow. I could hardly\r\nbelieve that so frail a bearing could possibly support a man's weight;\r\nbut a porter was tied as before, and sent up the ladder, while we\r\nfollowed protected by the rope. We were afterwards tied together, and\r\nthus advanced in an orderly line to the Grands Mulets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GORGEOUS SUNSET. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe cabin was wet and disagreeable, but the sunbeams fell upon the brown\r\nrocks outside, and thither Mr. Wills and myself repaired to watch the\r\nchanges of the atmosphere. I took possession of the flat summit of a\r\nprism of rock, where, lying upon my back, I watched the clouds forming,\r\nand melting, and massing themselves together, and tearing themselves\r\nlike wool asunder in the air above. It was nature's language addressed\r\nto the intellect; these clouds were visible symbols which enabled us to\r\nunderstand what was going on in the invisible air. Here unseen currents\r\nmet, possessing different temperatures, mixing their contents both of\r\nhumidity and motion, producing a mean temperature unable to hold their\r\nmoisture in a state of vapour. The water-particles, obeying their mutual\r\nattractions, closed up, and a visible cloud suddenly shook itself out,\r\nwhere a moment before we had the pure blue of heaven. Some of the clouds\r\nwere wafted by the air towards atmospheric regions already saturated\r\nwith moisture, and along their frontal borders new cloudlets ever piled\r\nthemselves, while the hinder portions, invaded by a drier or a warmer\r\nair, were dissipated; thus the cloud advanced, with gain in front and\r\nloss behind, its permanence depending on the balance between them. The\r\nday waned, and the sunbeams began to assume the colouring due to their\r\npassage through the horizontal air. The glorious light, ever deepening\r\nin colour, was poured bounteously over crags, and snows, and clouds, and\r\nsuffused with gold and crimson the atmosphere itself. I had never seen\r\nanything grander than the sunset on that day. Clouds with their central\r\nportions densely black, denying all passage to the beams which smote\r\nthem, floated westward, while the fiery fringes which bordered them were\r\nrendered doubly vivid by contrast with the adjacent gloom. The smaller\r\nand more attenuated clouds were intensely illuminated throughout. Across\r\nother inky masses were drawn zigzag bars of radiance which resembled\r\nstreaks of lightning. The firmament between the clouds faded from a\r\nblood-red through orange and daffodil into an exquisite green, which\r\nspread like a sea of glory through which those magnificent argosies\r\nslowly sailed. Some of the clouds were drawn in straight chords across\r\nthe arch of heaven, these being doubtless the sections of layers of\r\ncloud whose horizontal dimensions were hidden from us. The cumuli around\r\nand near the sun himself could not be gazed upon, until, as the day\r\ndeclined, they gradually lost their effulgence and became tolerable to\r\nthe eyes. All was calm--but there was a wildness in the sky like that of\r\nanger, which boded evil passions on the part of the atmosphere. The sun\r\nat length sank behind the hills, but for some time afterwards carmine\r\nclouds swung themselves on high, and cast their ruddy hues upon the\r\nmountain snows. Duskier and colder waxed the west, colder and sharper\r\nthe breeze of evening upon the Grands Mulets, and as twilight deepened\r\ntowards night, and the stars commenced to twinkle through the chilled\r\nair, we retired from the scene.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STORM ON THE GRANDS MULETS. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe anticipated storm at length gave notice of its coming. The\r\nsea-waves, as observed by Aristotle, sometimes reach the shore before\r\nthe wind which produces them is felt; and here the tempest sent out its\r\nprecursors, which broke in detached shocks upon the cabin before the\r\nreal storm arrived. Billows of air, in ever quicker succession, rolled\r\nover us with a long surging sound, rising and falling as crest succeeded\r\ntrough and trough succeeded crest. And as the pulses of a vibrating\r\nbody, when their succession is quick enough, blend to a continuous note,\r\nso these fitful gusts linked themselves finally to a storm which made\r\nits own wild music among the crags. Grandly it swelled, carrying the\r\nimagination out of doors, to the clouds and darkness, to the loosened\r\navalanches and whirling snow upon the mountain heads. Moored to the rock\r\non two sides, the cabin stood firm, and its manifest security allowed\r\nthe mind the undisturbed enjoyment of the atmospheric war. We were\r\npowerfully shaken, but had no fear of being uprooted; and a certain\r\ngrandeur of the heart rose responsive to the grandeur of the storm.\r\nMounting higher and higher, it at length reached its maximum strength,\r\nfrom which it lowered fitfully, until at length, with a melancholy wail,\r\nit bade our rock farewell.\r\n\r\nA little before half-past one we issued from the cabin. The night being\r\nwithout a moon, we carried three lanterns. The heavens were crowded with\r\nstars, among which, however, angry masses of cloud here and there still\r\nwandered. The storm, too, had left a rear-guard behind it; and strong\r\ngusts rolled down upon us at intervals, at one time, indeed, so violent\r\nas to cause Balmat to express doubts of our being able to reach the\r\nsummit. With a thick handkerchief bound around my hat and ears I enjoyed\r\nthe onset of the wind. Once, turning my head to the left, I saw what\r\nappeared to me to be a huge mass of stratus cloud, at a great distance,\r\nwith the stars shining over it. In another instant a precipice of _neve_\r\nloomed upon us; we were close to its base, and along its front the\r\nannual layers were separated from each other by broad dark bands.\r\nThrough the gloom it appeared like a cloud, the lines of bedding giving\r\nto it the stratus character.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A COMET DISCOVERED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nImmediately before lying down on the previous evening I had opened the\r\nlittle window of the cabin to admit some air. In the sky in front of me\r\nshone a curious nodule of misty light with a pale train attached to it.\r\nIn 1853, on the side of the Brocken, I had observed, without previous\r\nnotice, a comet discovered a few days previously by a former fellow\r\nstudent, and here was another \"discovery\" of the same kind. I inspected\r\nthe stranger with my telescope, and assured myself that it was a comet.\r\nMr. Wills chanced to be outside at the time, and made the same\r\nobservation independently. As we now advanced up the mountain its\r\nominous light gleamed behind us, while high up in heaven to our left the\r\nplanet Jupiter burned like a lamp of intense brightness. The Petit\r\nPlateau forms a kind of reservoir for the avalanches of the Dome du\r\nGouter, and this year the accumulation of frozen debris upon it was\r\nenormous. We could see nothing but the ice-blocks on which the light of\r\nthe lanterns immediately fell; we only knew that they had been\r\ndischarged from the _seracs_, and that similar masses now rose\r\nthreatening to our right, and might at any moment leap down upon us.\r\nBalmat commanded silence, and urged us to move across the plateau with\r\nall possible celerity. The warning of our guide, the wild and rakish\r\nappearance of the sky, the spent projectiles at our feet, and the comet\r\nwith its \"horrid hair\" behind, formed a combination eminently calculated\r\nto excite the imagination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DAWN ON THE GRAND PLATEAU. 1858.]\r\n\r\nAnd now the sky began to brighten towards dawn, with that deep and calm\r\nbeauty which suggests the thought of adoration to the human mind. Helped\r\nby the contemplation of the brightening east, which seemed to lend\r\nlightness to our muscles, we cheerily breasted the steep slope up to the\r\nGrand Plateau. The snow here was deep, and each of our porters took the\r\nlead in turn. We paused upon the Grand Plateau and had breakfast;\r\ndigging, while we halted, our feet deeply into the snow. Thence up to\r\nthe corridor, by a totally different route from that pursued by Mr.\r\nHirst and myself the year previously; the slope was steep, but it had\r\nnot a precipice for its boundary. Deep steps were necessary for a time,\r\nbut when we reached the summit our ascent became more gentle. The\r\neastern sky continued to brighten, and by its illumination the Grand\r\nPlateau and its bounding heights were lovely beyond conception. The snow\r\nwas of the purest white, and the glacier, as it pushed itself on all\r\nsides into the basin, was riven by fissures filled with a coerulean\r\nlight, which deepened to inky gloom as the vision descended into them.\r\nThe edges were overhung with fretted cornices, from which depended long\r\nclear icicles, tapering from their abutments like spears of crystal. The\r\ndistant fissures, across which the vision ranged obliquely without\r\ndescending into them, emitted that magical firmamental shimmer which,\r\ncontrasted with the pure white of the snow, was inexpressibly lovely.\r\nNear to us also grand castles of ice reared themselves, some erect, some\r\noverturned, with clear cut sides, striped by the courses of the annual\r\nsnows, while high above the _seracs_ of the plateau rose their still\r\ngrander brothers of the Dome du Gouter. There was a nobility in this\r\nglacier scene which I think I have never seen surpassed;--a strength of\r\nnature, and yet a tenderness, which at once raised and purified the\r\nsoul. The gush of the direct sunlight could add nothing to this heavenly\r\nbeauty; indeed I thought its yellow beams a profanation as they crept\r\ndown from the humps of the Dromedary, and invaded more and more the\r\nsolemn purity of the realm below.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BALMAT IN DANGER. 1858.]\r\n\r\nOur way lay for a time amid fine fissures with blue walls, until at\r\nlength we reached the edge of one which elicited other sentiments than\r\nthose of admiration. It must be crossed. At the opposite side was a high\r\nand steep bank of ice which prolonged itself downwards, and ended in a\r\ndependent eave of snow which quite overhung the chasm, and reached to\r\nwithin about a yard of our edge of the crevasse. Balmat came forward\r\nwith his axe, and tried to get a footing on the eave: he beat it gently,\r\nbut the axe went through the snow, forming an aperture through which the\r\ndarkness of the chasm was rendered visible. Our guide was quite free,\r\nwithout rope or any other means of security; he beat down the snow so as\r\nto form a kind of stirrup, and upon this he stepped. The stirrup gave\r\nway, it was right over the centre of the chasm, but with wonderful tact\r\nand coolness he contrived to get sufficient purchase from the yielding\r\nmass to toss himself back to the side of the chasm. The rope was now\r\nbrought forward and tied round the waist of one of the porters; another\r\nstep was cautiously made in the eave of snow, the man was helped across,\r\nand lessened his own weight by means of his hatchet. He gradually got\r\nfooting on the face of the steep, which he mounted by escaliers; and on\r\nreaching a sufficient height he cut two large steps in which his feet\r\nmight rest securely. Here he laid his breast against the sloping wall,\r\nand another person was sent forward, who drew himself up by the rope\r\nwhich was attached to the leader. Thus we all passed, each of us in turn\r\nbearing the strain of his successor upon the rope; it was our last\r\ndifficulty, and we afterwards slowly plodded through the snow of the\r\ncorridor towards the base of the Mur de la Cote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STORM ON MONT BLANC. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THERMOMETER BURIED. 1858.]\r\n\r\nClimbing zigzag, we soon reached the summit of the Mur, and immediately\r\nafterwards found ourselves in the midst of cold drifting clouds, which\r\nobscured everything. They dissolved for a moment and revealed to us the\r\nsunny valley of Chamouni; but they soon swept down again and completely\r\nenveloped us. Upon the Calotte, or last slope, I felt no trace of the\r\nexhaustion which I had experienced last year, but enjoyed free lungs and\r\na quiet heart. The clouds now whirled wildly round us, and the fine\r\nsnow, which was caught by the wind and spit bitterly against us, cut off\r\nall visible communication between us and the lower world. As we\r\napproached the summit the air thickened more and more, and the cold,\r\nresulting from the withdrawal of the sunbeams, became intense. We\r\nreached the top, however, in good condition, and found the new snow\r\npiled up into a sharp _arete_, and the summit of a form quite different\r\nfrom that of the _Dos d'un Ane_, which it had presented the previous\r\nyear. Leaving Balmat to make a hole for the thermometer, I collected a\r\nnumber of batons, drove them into the snow, and, drawing my plaid round\r\nthem, formed a kind of extempore tent to shelter my boiling-water\r\napparatus. The covering was tightly held, but the snow was as fine and\r\ndry as dust, and penetrated everywhere: my lamp could not be secured\r\nfrom it, and half a box of matches was consumed in the effort to ignite\r\nit. At length it did flame up, and carried on a sputtering combustion.\r\nThe cold of the snow-filled boiler condensing the vapour from the lamp\r\ngradually produced a drop, which, when heavy enough to detach itself\r\nfrom the vessel, fell upon the flame and put it out. It required much\r\npatience and the expenditure of many matches to relight it. Meanwhile\r\nthe absence of muscular action caused the cold to affect our men\r\nseverely. My beard and whiskers were a mass of clotted ice. The batons\r\nwere coated with ice, and even the stem of my thermometer, the bulb of\r\nwhich was in hot water, was covered by a frozen enamel. The clouds\r\nwhirled, and the little snow granules hit spitefully against the skin\r\nwherever it was exposed. The temperature of the air was 20 deg. Fahr. below\r\nthe freezing point. I was too intent upon my work to heed the cold much,\r\nbut I was numbed; one of my fingers had lost sensation, and my right\r\nheel was in pain: still I had no thought of forsaking my observation\r\nuntil Mr. Wills came to me and said that we must return speedily, for\r\nBalmat's hands were _gelees_. I did not comprehend the full significance\r\nof the word; but, looking at the porters, they presented such an aspect\r\nof suffering that I feared to detain them longer. They looked like worn\r\nold men, their hair and clothing white with snow, and their faces blue,\r\nwithered, and anxious-looking. The hole being ready, I asked Balmat for\r\nthe magnet to arrange the index of the thermometer: his hands seemed\r\npowerless. I struck my tent, deposited the instrument, and, as I watched\r\nthe covering of it up, some of the party, among whom were Mr. Wills and\r\nBalmat, commenced the descent.[A]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BALMAT FROSTBITTEN. 1858.]\r\n\r\nI followed them speedily. Midway down the Calotte I saw Balmat, who was\r\nabout a hundred yards in advance of me, suddenly pause and thrust his\r\nhands into the snow, and commence rubbing them vigorously. The\r\nsuddenness of the act surprised me, but I had no idea at the time of its\r\nreal significance: I soon came up to him; he seemed frightened, and\r\ncontinued to beat and rub his hands, plunging them, at quick intervals,\r\ninto the snow. Still I thought the thing would speedily pass away, for\r\nI had too much faith in the man's experience to suppose that he would\r\npermit himself to be seriously injured. But it did not pass as I hoped\r\nit would, and the terrible possibility of his losing his hands presented\r\nitself to me. He at length became exhausted by his own efforts,\r\nstaggered like a drunken man, and fell upon the snow. Mr. Wills and\r\nmyself took each a hand, and continued the process of beating and\r\nrubbing. I feared that we should injure him by our blows, but he\r\ncontinued to exclaim, \"N'ayez pas peur, frappez toujours, frappez\r\nfortement!\" We did so, until Mr. Wills became exhausted, and a porter\r\nhad to take his place. Meanwhile Balmat pinched and bit his fingers at\r\nintervals, to test their condition; but there was no sensation. He was\r\nevidently hopeless himself; and, seeing him thus, produced an effect\r\nupon me that I had not experienced since my boyhood--my heart swelled,\r\nand I could have wept like a child. The idea that I should be in some\r\nmeasure the cause of his losing his hands was horrible to me; schemes\r\nfor his support rushed through my mind with the usual swiftness of such\r\nspeculations, but no scheme could restore to him his lost hands. At\r\nlength returning sensation in one hand announced itself by excruciating\r\npain. \"Je souffre!\" he exclaimed at intervals--words which, from a man\r\nof his iron endurance, had a more than ordinary significance. But pain\r\nwas better than death, and, under the circumstances, a sign of\r\nimprovement. We resumed our descent, while he continued to rub his hands\r\nwith snow and brandy, thrusting them at every few paces into the mass\r\nthrough which we marched. At Chamouni he had skilful medical advice, by\r\nadhering to which he escaped with the loss of six of his nails--his\r\nhands were saved.\r\n\r\nI cannot close this recital without expressing my admiration of the\r\ndauntless bearing of our porters, and of the cheerful and efficient\r\nmanner in which they did their duty throughout the whole expedition.\r\nTheir names are Edouard Bellin, Joseph Favret, Michel Payot, Joseph\r\nFolliguet, and Alexandre Balmat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] In August, 1859, I found the temperature of water, boiling in an\r\nopen vessel at the summit of Mont Blanc, to be 184.95 deg. Fahr. On that\r\noccasion also, though a laborious search was made for the thermometer,\r\nit could not be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(26.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROCES-VERBAL. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThe hostility of the chief guide to the expedition was not diminished by\r\nthe letter of the Intendant; and he at once entered a _proces-verbal_\r\nagainst Balmat and his companions on their return to Chamouni. I felt\r\nthat the power thus vested in an unlettered man to arrest the progress\r\nof scientific observations was so anomalous, that the enlightened and\r\nliberal Government of Sardinia would never tolerate such a state of\r\nthings if properly represented to it. The British Association met at\r\nLeeds that year, and to it, as a guardian of science, my thoughts\r\nturned. I accordingly laid the case before the Association, and obtained\r\nits support: a resolution was unanimously passed \"that application be\r\nmade to the Sardinian authorities for increased facilities for making\r\nscientific observations in the Alps.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering the arduous work which Balmat had performed in former years\r\nin connexion with the glaciers, and especially his zeal in determining,\r\nunder the direction of Professor Forbes, their winter motion--for which,\r\nas in the case above recorded, he refused all personal remuneration--I\r\nthought such services worthy of some recognition on the part of the\r\nRoyal Society. I suggested this to the Council, and was met by the same\r\ncordial spirit of co-operation which I had previously experienced at\r\nLeeds. A sum of five-and-twenty guineas was at once voted for the\r\npurchase of a suitable testimonial; and a committee, consisting of Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison, Professor Forbes, and myself, was appointed to\r\ncarry the thing out. Balmat was consulted, and he chose a photographic\r\napparatus, which, with a suitable inscription, was duly presented to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRITISH ASSOCIATION. 1858.]\r\n\r\nThus fortified, I drew up an account of what had occurred at Chamouni\r\nduring my last visit, accompanied by a brief statement of the changes\r\nwhich seemed desirable. This was placed in the hands of the President of\r\nthe British Association, to whose prompt and powerful co-operation in\r\nthis matter every Alpine explorer who aspires to higher ground than\r\nordinary is deeply indebted. The following letter assured me that the\r\nfacility applied for by the British Association would be granted by the\r\nSardinian Government, and that future men of science would find in the\r\nAlps a less embarrassed field of operations than had fallen to my lot in\r\nthe summer of 1858.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PRESIDENT'S LETTER. 1858.]\r\n\r\n                              \"12, Hertford-street, Mayfair, W.,\r\n                              \"February 18th, 1859.\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Sir,--\r\n\r\n     \"Having, as I informed you in my last note, communicated with\r\n     the Sardinian Minister Plenipotentiary the day after receiving\r\n     your statement relative to the guides at Chamouni, I have been\r\n     favoured by replies from the Minister, of the 4th and 17th\r\n     February. In the first the Marquis d'Azeglio assures me that he\r\n     will bring the subject before the competent authorities at\r\n     Turin, accompanying the transmission 'd'une recommandation\r\n     toute speciale.' In the second letter the Marquis informs me\r\n     that 'the preparation of new regulations for the guides at\r\n     Chamouni had for some time occupied the attention of the\r\n     Minister of the Interior, and that these regulations will be in\r\n     rigorous operation, in all probability, at the commencement of\r\n     the approaching summer.' The Marquis adds that, 'as the\r\n     regulations will be based upon a principle of much greater\r\n     liberty, he has every reason to believe that they will satisfy\r\n     all the desires of travellers in the interests of science.'\r\n\r\n     \"With much pleasure at the opportunity of having been in any\r\n     degree able to bring about the fulfilment of your wishes on the\r\n     subject,\r\n\r\n                              \"I remain, my dear Sir,\r\n                              \"Faithfully yours,\r\n                              \"RICHARD OWEN.\r\n                              \"Pres.

On Wednesday, the 21st of December, I accordingly\r\ntook my place to Paris, but on arriving at Folkestone found the sea so\r\ntempestuous that no boat would venture out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIRST DEFEAT, AND FRESH ATTEMPT. 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe loss of a single day was more than I could afford, and this failure\r\nreally involved the loss of two. Seeing, therefore, the prospect of any\r\npractical success so small, I returned to London, purposing to give the\r\nexpedition up. On the following day, however, the weather lightened, and\r\nI started again, reaching Paris on Friday morning. On that day it was\r\nnot possible to proceed beyond Macon, where, accordingly, I spent the\r\nnight, and on the following day reached Geneva.\r\n\r\nMuch snow had fallen; at Paris it still cumbered the streets, and round\r\nabout Macon it lay thick, as if a more than usually heavy cloud had\r\ndischarged itself on that portion of the country. Between Macon and\r\nRoussillon it was lighter, but from the latter station onwards the\r\nquantity upon the ground gradually increased.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENEVA TO CHAMOUNI. 1859.]\r\n\r\nOn Christmas morning, at 8 o'clock, I left Geneva by the diligence for\r\nSallenches. The dawn was dull, but the sky cleared as the day advanced,\r\nand finally a dome of cloudless blue stretched overhead. The mountains\r\nwere grand; their sunward portions of dazzling whiteness, while the\r\nshaded sides, in contrast with the blue sky behind them, presented a\r\nruddy, subjective tint. The brightness of the day reached its maximum\r\ntowards one o'clock, after which a milkiness slowly stole over the\r\nheavens, and increased in density until finally a drowsy turbidity\r\nfilled the entire air. The distant peaks gradually blended with the\r\nwhite atmosphere above them and lost their definition. The black pine\r\nforests on the slopes of the mountains stood out in strong contrast to\r\nthe snow; and, when looked at through the spaces enclosed by the tree\r\nbranches at either side of the road, they appeared of a decided\r\nindigo-blue. It was only when thus detached by a vista in front that the\r\nblue colour was well seen, the air itself between the eye and the\r\ndistant pines being the seat of the colour. Goethe would have regarded\r\nit as an excellent illustration of his 'Farbenlehre.'\r\n\r\nWe reached Sallenches a little after 4 P.M., where I endeavoured to\r\nobtain a sledge to continue my journey. A fit one was not to be found,\r\nand a carriage was therefore the only resort. We started at five; it was\r\nvery dark, but the feeble reflex of the snow on each side of the road\r\nwas preferred by the postilion to the light of lamps. Unlike the\r\nenviable ostrich, I cannot shut my eyes to danger when it is near: and\r\nas the carriage swayed towards the precipitous road side, I could not\r\nfold myself up, as it was intended I should, but, quitting the interior\r\nand divesting my limbs of every encumbrance, I took my seat beside the\r\ndriver, and kept myself in readiness for the spring, which in some cases\r\nappeared imminent. My companion however was young, strong, and\r\nkeen-eyed; and though we often had occasion for the exercise of the\r\nquality last mentioned, we reached Servoz without accident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESOLATION. 1859.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A HORSE IN THE SNOW. 1859.]\r\n\r\nHere we baited, and our progress afterwards was slow and difficult. The\r\nsnow on the road was deep and hummocky, and the strain upon the horses\r\nvery great. Having crossed the Arve at the Pont-Pelissier, we both\r\nalighted, and I went on in advance. The air was warm, and not a whisper\r\ndisturbed its perfect repose. There was no moon, and the heavy clouds,\r\nwhich now quite overspread the heavens, cut off even the feeble light of\r\nthe stars. The sound of the Arve, as it rushed through the deep valley\r\nto my left, came up to me through crags and trees with a sad murmur.\r\nSometimes on passing an obstacle, the sound was entirely cut off, and\r\nthe consequent silence was solemn in the extreme. It was a churchyard\r\nstillness, and the tall black pines, which at intervals cast their\r\nsuperadded gloom upon the road, seemed like the hearse-plumes of a dead\r\nworld. I reached a wooden hut, where a lame man offers batons, minerals,\r\nand _eau de vie_, to travellers in summer. It was forsaken, and half\r\nburied in the snow. I leaned against the door, and enjoyed for a time\r\nthe sternness of the surrounding scene. My conveyance was far behind,\r\nand the intermittent tinkle of the horses' bells, which augmented\r\ninstead of diminishing the sense of solitude, informed me of the\r\nprogress and the pauses of the vehicle. At the summit of the road I\r\nhalted until my companion reached me; we then both remounted, and\r\nproceeded slowly towards Les Ouches. We passed some houses, the aspect\r\nof which was even more dismal than that of Nature; their roofs were\r\nloaded with snow, and white buttresses were reared against the walls.\r\nThere was no sound, no light, no voice of joy to indicate that it was\r\nthe pleasant Christmas time. We once met the pioneer of a party of four\r\ndrunken peasants: he came right against us, and the coachman had to pull\r\nup. Planting his feet in the snow and propping himself against the\r\nleader's shoulder, the bacchanal exhorted the postilion to drive on; the\r\nlatter took him at his word, and overturned him in the snow. After this\r\nwe encountered no living thing. The horses seemed seized by a kind of\r\ntorpor, and leaned listlessly against each other; vainly the postilion\r\nendeavoured to rouse them by word and whip; they sometimes essayed to\r\ntrot down the slopes, but immediately subsided to their former\r\nmonotonous crawl. As we ascended the valley, the stillness of the air\r\nwas broken at intervals by wild storm-gusts, sent down against us from\r\nMont Blanc himself. These chilled me, so I quitted the carriage, and\r\nwalked on. Not far from Chamouni, the road, for some distance, had been\r\nexposed to the full action of the wind, and the snow had practically\r\nerased it. Its left wall was completely covered, while a few detached\r\nstones, rising here and there above the surface, were the only\r\nindications of the presence and direction of the right-hand wall. I\r\ncould not see the state of the surface, but I learned by other means\r\nthat the snow had been heaped in oblique ridges across my path. I\r\nstaggered over four or five of these in succession, sinking knee-deep,\r\nand finally found myself immersed to the waist. This made me pause; I\r\nthought I must have lost the road, and vainly endeavoured to check\r\nmyself by the positions of surrounding objects. I turned back and met\r\nthe carriage: it had stuck in one of the ridges; one horse was down, his\r\nhind legs buried to the haunches, his left fore leg plunged to the\r\nshoulder in snow, and the right one thrown forward upon the surface.\r\n_C'est bien la route?_ demanded my companion. I went back exploring, and\r\nassured myself that we were over the road; but I recommended him to\r\nrelease the horses and leave the carriage to its fate. He, however,\r\nsucceeding in extricating the leader, and while I went on in advance\r\nseeking out the firmer portions of the road, he followed, holding his\r\nhorses by their heads; and half an hour's struggle of this kind brought\r\nus to Chamouni.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHAMOUNI ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT. 1859.]\r\n\r\nIt also was a little \"city of the dead.\" There was no living thing in\r\nthe streets, and neither sound nor light in the houses. The fountain\r\nmade a melancholy gurgle, one or two loosened window-shutters creaked\r\nharshly in the wind, and banged against the objects which limited their\r\noscillations. The Hotel de l'Union, so bright and gay in summer, was\r\nnailed up and forsaken; and the cross in front of it, stretching its\r\nsnow-laden arms into the dim air, was the type of desolation. We rang\r\nthe bell at the Hotel Royal, but the bay of a watch-dog resounding\r\nthrough the house was long our only reply. The bell appeared powerless\r\nto wake the sleepers, and its sound mingled dismally with that of the\r\nwind howling through the deserted passages. The noise of my boot-heel,\r\nexerted long on the front door, was at length effective; it was\r\nunbarred, and the physical heat of a good stove soon added itself to the\r\nwarmth of the welcome with which my hostess greeted me.\r\n\r\nDecember 26th.--The snow fell heavily, at frequent intervals, throughout\r\nthe entire day. Dense clouds draped all the mountains, and there was not\r\nthe least prospect of my being able to see across the Mer de Glace. I\r\nwalked out alone in the dim light, and afterwards traversed the streets\r\nbefore going to bed. They were quite forsaken. Cold and sullen the Arve\r\nrolled under its wooden bridge, while the snow fell at intervals with\r\nheavy shock from the roofs of the houses, the partial echoes from the\r\nsurfaces of the granules combining to render the sound loud and hollow.\r\nThus were the concerns of this little hamlet changed and fashioned by\r\nthe obliquity of the earth's axis, the chain of dependence which runs\r\nthroughout creation, linking the roll of a planet alike with the\r\ninterests of marmots and of men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASCENT OF THE MOUNTAIN. 1859.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SNOW ON THE PINES. 1859.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 27th December.--I rose at six o'clock, having arranged with my\r\nmen to start at seven, if the weather at all permitted. Edouard Simond,\r\nmy old assistant of 1857, and Joseph Tairraz were the guides of the\r\nparty; the porters were Edouard Balmat, Joseph Simond (fils d'Auguste),\r\nFrancois Ravanal, and another. They came at the time appointed; it was\r\nsnowing heavily, and we agreed to wait till eight o'clock and then\r\ndecide. They returned at eight, and finding them disposed to try the\r\nascent to the Montanvert, it was not my place to baulk them. Through the\r\nvalley the work was easy, as the snow had been partially beaten down,\r\nbut we soon passed the habitable limits, and had to break ground for\r\nourselves. Three of my men had tried to reach the Montanvert by _la\r\nFilia_ on the previous Thursday, but their experience of the route had\r\nbeen such as to deter them from trying it again. We now chose the\r\nordinary route, breasting the slope until we reached the cluster of\r\nchalets, under the projecting eave of one of which the men halted and\r\napplied \"pattens\" to their feet. These consisted of planks about sixteen\r\ninches long and ten wide, which were firmly strapped to the feet. My\r\nfirst impression was that they were worse than useless, for though they\r\nsank less deeply than the unarmed feet, on being raised they carried\r\nwith them a larger amount of snow, which, with the leverage of the leg,\r\nappeared to necessitate an enormous waste of force. I stated this\r\nemphatically, but the men adhered to their pattens, and before I reached\r\nthe Montanvert I had reason to commend their practice as preferable to\r\nmy theory. I was however guided by the latter, and wore no pattens. The\r\ngeneral depth of the snow along the track was over three feet; the\r\nfootmarks of the men were usually rigid enough to bear my weight, but in\r\nmany cases I went through the crust which their pressure had produced,\r\nand sank suddenly in the mass. The snow became softer as we ascended,\r\nand my immersions more frequent, but the work was pure enjoyment, and\r\nthe scene one of extreme beauty. The previous night's snow had descended\r\nthrough a perfectly still atmosphere, and had loaded all the branches of\r\nthe pines; the long arms of the trees drooped under the weight, and\r\npresented at their extremities the appearance of enormous talons turned\r\ndownwards. Some of the smaller and thicker trees were almost entirely\r\ncovered, and assumed grotesque and beautiful forms; the upper part of\r\none in particular resembled a huge white parrot with folded wings and\r\ndrooping head, the slumber of the bird harmonizing with the torpor of\r\nsurrounding nature. I have given a sketch of it in Fig. 13.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Snow on the Pines.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOUND OF BREAKING SNOW. 1859.]\r\n\r\nPrevious to reaching the half-way spring, where the peasant girls offer\r\nstrawberries to travellers in summer, we crossed two large couloirs\r\nfilled with the debris of avalanches which had fallen the night before.\r\nBetween these was a ridge forty or fifty yards wide on which the snow\r\nwas very deep, the slope of the mountain also adding a component to the\r\nfair thickness of the snow. My shoulder grazed the top of the embankment\r\nto my right as I crossed the ridge, and once or twice I found myself\r\nwaist deep in a vertical shaft from which it required a considerable\r\neffort to escape. Suddenly we heard a deep sound resembling the dull\r\nreport of a distant gun, and at the same moment the snow above us broke\r\nacross, forming a fissure parallel to our line of march. The layer of\r\nsnow had been in a state of strain, which our crossing brought to a\r\ncrisis: it gave way, but having thus relieved itself it did not descend.\r\nSeveral times during the ascent the same phenomenon occurred. Once,\r\nwhile engaged upon a very steep slope, one of the men cried out to the\r\nleader, \"_Arretez!_\" Immediately in front of the latter the snow had\r\ngiven way, forming a zigzag fissure across the slope. We all paused,\r\nexpecting to see an avalanche descend. Tairraz was in front; he struck\r\nthe snow with his baton to loosen it, but seeing it indisposed to\r\ndescend he advanced cautiously across it, and was followed by the\r\nothers. I brought up the rear. The steepness of the mountain side at\r\nthis place, and the absence of any object to which one might cling,\r\nwould have rendered a descent with the snow in the last degree perilous,\r\nand we all felt more at ease when a safe footing was secured at the\r\nfurther side of the incline.\r\n\r\nAt the spring, which showed a little water, the men paused to have a\r\nmorsel of bread. The wind had changed, the air was clearing, and our\r\nhopes brightening. As we ascended the atmosphere went through some\r\nextraordinary mutations. Clouds at first gathered round the Aiguille and\r\nDome du Gouter, casting the lower slopes of the mountain into intense\r\ngloom. After a little time all this cleared away, and the beams of the\r\nsun striking detached pieces of the slopes and summits produced an\r\nextraordinary effect. The Aiguille and Dome were most singularly\r\nillumined, and to the extreme left rose the white conical hump of the\r\nDromedary, from which a long streamer of snow-dust was carried southward\r\nby the wind. The Aiguille du Dru, which had been completely mantled\r\nduring the earlier part of the day, now threw off its cloak of vapour\r\nand rose in most solemn majesty before us; half of its granite cone was\r\nwarmly illuminated, and half in shadow. The wind was high in the upper\r\nregions, and, catching the dry snow which rested on the asperities and\r\nledges of the Aiguille, shook it out like a vast banner in the air. The\r\nchanges of the atmosphere, and the grandeur which they by turns revealed\r\nand concealed, deprived the ascent of all weariness. We were usually\r\nflanked right and left by pines, but once between the fountain and the\r\nMontanvert we had to cross a wide unsheltered portion of the mountain\r\nwhich was quite covered with the snow of recent avalanches. This was\r\nlumpy and far more coherent than the undisturbed snow. We took advantage\r\nof this, and climbed zigzag over the avalanches for three-quarters of an\r\nhour, thus reaching the opposite pines at a point considerably higher\r\nthan the path. This, though not the least dangerous, was the least\r\nfatiguing part of the ascent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COLOUR OF SNOW. 1859.]\r\n\r\nI frequently examined the colour of the snow: though fresh, its blue\r\ntint was by no means so pronounced as I have seen it on other occasions;\r\nstill it was beautiful. The colour is, no doubt, due to the optical\r\nreverberations which occur within a fissure or cavity formed in the\r\nsnow. The light is sent from side to side, each time plunging a little\r\nway into the mass; and being ejected from it by reflection, it thus\r\nundergoes a sifting process, and finally reaches the eye as blue light.\r\nThe presence of any object which cuts off this cross-fire of the light\r\ndestroys the colour. I made conical apertures in the snow, in some cases\r\nthree feet deep, a foot wide at the mouth, and tapering down to the\r\nwidth of my baton. When the latter was placed along the axis of such a\r\ncone, the blue light which had previously filled the cavity disappeared;\r\non the withdrawal of the baton it was followed by the light, and thus by\r\nmoving the staff up and down its motions were followed by the alternate\r\nappearance and extinction of the light. I have said that the holes made\r\nin the snow seemed filled with a blue light, and it certainly appeared\r\nas if the air contained in the cavities had itself been coloured, and\r\nthereby rendered visible, the vision plunging into it as into a blue\r\nmedium. Another fact is perhaps worth notice: snow rarely lies so smooth\r\nas not to present little asperities at its surface; little ridges or\r\nhillocks, with little hollows between them. Such small hollows resemble,\r\nin some degree, the cavities which I made in the snow, and from them, in\r\nthe present instance, a delicate light was sent to the eye, faintly\r\ntinted with the pure blue of the snow-crystals. In comparison with the\r\nspots thus illuminated, the little protuberances were gray. The portions\r\nmost exposed to the light seemed least illuminated, and their defect in\r\nthis respect made them appear as if a light-brown dust had been strewn\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MONTANVERT IN WINTER. 1859.]\r\n\r\nAfter five hours and a half of hard work we reached the Montanvert. I\r\nhad often seen it with pleasure. Often, having spent the day alone amid\r\nthe _seracs_ of the Col du Geant, on turning the promontory of\r\nTrelaporte on my way home, the sight of the little mansion has gladdened\r\nme, and given me vigour to scamper down the glacier, knowing that\r\npleasant faces and wholesome fare were awaiting me. This day, also, the\r\nsight of it was most welcome, despite its desolation. The wind had swept\r\nround the auberge, and carried away its snow-buttresses, piling the mass\r\nthus displaced against the adjacent sheds, to the roofs of which one\r\nmight step from the surface of the snow. The floor of the little chateau\r\nin which I lodged in 1857 was covered with snow, and on it were the\r\nfresh footmarks of a little animal--a marmot might have made such marks,\r\nhad not the marmots been all asleep--what the creature was I do not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRYSTAL CURTAIN. 1859.]\r\n\r\nIn the application of her own principles, Nature often transcends the\r\nhuman imagination; her acts are bolder than our predictions. It is thus\r\nwith the motion of glaciers; it was thus at the Montanvert on the day\r\nnow referred to. The floors, even where the windows appeared well\r\nclosed, were covered with a thin layer of fine snow; and some of the\r\nmattresses in the bedrooms were coated to the depth of half an inch with\r\nthis fine powder. Given a chink through which the finest dust can pass,\r\ndry snow appears competent to make its way through the same fissure. It\r\nhad also been beaten against the windows, and clung there like a ribbed\r\ndrapery. In one case an effect so singular was exhibited, that I doubted\r\nmy eyes when I first saw it. In front of a large pane of glass, and\r\nquite detached from it, save at its upper edge, was a festooned curtain\r\nformed entirely of minute ice-crystals. It appeared to be as fine as\r\nmuslin; the ease of its curves and the depth of its folds being such as\r\ncould not be excelled by the intentional arrangement of ordinary gauze.\r\nThe frost-figures on some of the window-panes were also of the most\r\nextraordinary character: in some cases they extended over large spaces,\r\nand presented the appearance which we often observe in London; but on\r\nother panes they occurred in detached clusters, or in single flowers,\r\nthese grouping themselves together to form miniature bouquets of\r\ninimitable beauty. I placed my warm hand against a pane which was\r\ncovered by the crystallization, and melted the frostwork which clung to\r\nit. I then withdrew my hand and looked at the film of liquid through a\r\npocket-lens. The glass cooled by contact with the air, and after a time\r\nthe film commenced to move at one of its edges; atom closed with atom,\r\nand the motion ran in living lines through the pellicle, until finally\r\nthe entire film presented the beauty and delicacy of an organism. The\r\nconnexion between such objects and what we are accustomed to call the\r\nfeelings may not be manifest, but it is nevertheless true that, besides\r\nappealing to the pure intellect of man, these exquisite productions can\r\nalso gladden his heart and moisten his eyes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MER DE GLACE IN WINTER. 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe glacier excited the admiration of us all: not as in summer, shrunk\r\nand sullied like a spent reptile, steaming under the influence of the\r\nsun; its frozen muscles were compact, strength and beauty were\r\nassociated in its aspect. At some places it was pure and smooth; at\r\nothers frozen fins arose from it, high, steep, and sharply crested. Down\r\nthe opposite mountain side arrested streams set themselves erect in\r\nsuccessive terraces, the fronts of which were fluted pillars of ice.\r\nThere was no sound of water; even the Nant Blanc, which gushes from a\r\nspring, and which some describe as permanent throughout the winter,\r\nshowed no trace of existence. From the Montanvert to Trelaporte the Mer\r\nde Glace was all in shadow; but the sunbeams pouring down the corridor\r\nof the Geant ruled a beam of light across the glacier at its upper\r\nportion, smote the base of the Aiguille du Moine, and flooded the\r\nmountain with glory to its crest. At the opposite side of the valley was\r\nthe Aiguille du Dru, with a banneret of snow streaming from its mighty\r\ncone. The Grande Jorasse, and the range of summits between it and the\r\nAiguille du Geant, were all in view, and the Charmoz raised its\r\nprecipitous cliffs to the right, and pierced with its splinter-like\r\npinnacles the clear cold air. As the night drew on, the mountains seemed\r\nto close in upon us; and on looking out before retiring to rest, a scene\r\nso solemn had never before presented itself to my eyes or affected my\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FIRST NIGHT. 1859.]\r\n\r\nMy men occupied the afternoon of the day of our arrival in making a\r\npreliminary essay upon the glacier while I prepared my instruments. To\r\nthe person whom I intended to fix my stations, three others were\r\nattached by sound ropes of considerable length. Hidden crevasses we\r\nknew were to be encountered, and we had made due preparation for them.\r\nThroughout the afternoon the weather remained fine, and at night the\r\nstars shone out, but still with a feeble lustre. I could notice a\r\nturbidity gathering in the air over the range of the Brevent, which\r\nseemed disposed to extend itself towards us. At night I placed a chair\r\nin the middle of the snow, at some distance from the house, and laid on\r\nit a registering thermometer. A bountiful fire of pine logs was made in\r\nthe _salle a manger_; a mattress was placed with its foot towards the\r\nfire, its middle line bisecting the right angle in which the fireplace\r\nstood; this being found by experiment to be the position in which the\r\ndraughts from the door and from the windows most effectually neutralized\r\neach other. In this region of calms I lay down, and covering myself with\r\nblankets and duvets, listened to the crackling of the logs, and watched\r\ntheir ruddy flicker upon the walls, until I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThe wind rose during the night, and shook the windows: one pane in\r\nparticular seemed set in unison to the gusts, and responded to them by a\r\nloud and melodious vibration. I rose and wedged it round with _sous_ and\r\npenny pieces, and thus quenched its untimely music.\r\n\r\nDecember 28th.--We were up before the dawn. Tairraz put my fire in\r\norder, and I then rose. The temperature of the room at a distance of\r\neight feet from the fire was two degrees of Centigrade below zero; the\r\nlowest temperature outside was eleven degrees of Centigrade below\r\nzero,--not at all an excessive cold. The clouds indeed had, during the\r\nnight, thrown vast diaphragms across the sky, and thus prevented the\r\nescape of the earth's heat into space.\r\n\r\nWhile my assistants were preparing breakfast I had time to inspect the\r\nglacier and its bounding heights. On looking up the Mer de Glace, the\r\nGrande Jorasse meets the view, rising in steep outline from the wall of\r\ncliffs which terminates the Glacier de Lechaud. Behind this steep\r\nascending ridge, which is shown on the frontispiece, and upon it, a\r\nseries of clouds had ranged themselves, stretching lightly along the\r\nridge at some places, and at others collecting into ganglia. A string of\r\nrosettes was thus formed which were connected together by gauzy\r\nfilaments. The portion of the heavens behind the ridge was near the\r\ndomain of the rising sun, and when he cleared the horizon his red light\r\nfell upon the clouds, and ignited them to ruddy flames. Some of the\r\nlighter clouds doubled round the summit of the mountain, and swathed its\r\nblack crags with a vestment of transparent red. The adjacent sky wore a\r\nstrange and supernatural air; indeed there was something in the whole\r\nscene which baffled analysis, and the words of Tennyson rose to my lips\r\nas I gazed upon it:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A \"ROSE OF DAWN.\" 1859.]\r\n\r\n  \"God made Himself an awful rose of dawn.\"\r\n\r\nI have spoken several times of the cloud-flag which the wind wafted from\r\nthe summit of the Aiguille du Dru. On the present occasion this grand\r\nbanner reached extraordinary dimensions. It was brindled in some places\r\nas if whipped into curds by the wind; but through these continuous\r\nstreamers were drawn, which were bent into sinuosities resembling a\r\nwaving flag at a mast-head. All this was now illuminated with the sun's\r\nred rays, which also fringed with fire the exposed edges and pinnacles\r\nboth of the Aiguille du Dru and the Aiguille Verte. Thus rising out of\r\nthe shade of the valley the mountains burned like a pair of torches, the\r\nflames of which were blown half a mile through the air. Soon afterwards\r\nthe summits of the Aiguilles Rouges were illuminated, and day declared\r\nitself openly among the mountains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE STAKES FIXED. 1859.]\r\n\r\nBut these red clouds of the morning, magnificent though they were,\r\nsuggested thoughts which tended to qualify the pleasure which they gave:\r\nthey did not indicate good weather. Sometimes, indeed, they had to fight\r\nwith denser masses, which often prevailed, swathing the mountains in\r\ndeep neutral tint, but which, again yielding, left the glory of the\r\nsunrise augmented by contrast with their gloom. Between eight and nine\r\nA.M. we commenced the setting out of our first line, one of whose\r\ntermini was a point about a hundred yards higher up than the Montanvert\r\nhotel; a withered pine on the opposite mountain side marking the other\r\nterminus. The stakes made use of were four feet long. With the selfsame\r\nbaton which I had employed upon the Mer de Glace in 1857, and which\r\nSimond had preserved, the worthy fellow now took up the line. At some\r\nplaces the snow was very deep, but its lower portions were sufficiently\r\ncompact to allow of a stake being firmly fixed in it. At those places\r\nwhere the wind had removed the snow or rendered it thin, the ice was\r\npierced with an auger and the stake driven into it. The greatest caution\r\nwas of course necessary on the part of the men; they were in the midst\r\nof concealed crevasses, and sounding was essential at every step. By\r\ndegrees they withdrew from me, and approached the eastern boundary of\r\nthe glacier, where the ice was greatly dislocated, and the labour of\r\nwading through the snow enormous. Long detours were sometimes necessary\r\nto reach a required point; but they were all accomplished, and we at\r\nlength succeeded in fixing eleven stakes along this line, the most\r\ndistant of which was within about eighty yards of the opposite side of\r\nthe glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STORM ON THE GLACIER. 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe men returned, and I consulted them as to the possibility of getting\r\na line across at the _Ponts_; but this was judged to be impossible in\r\nthe time. We thought, however, that a second line might be staked out at\r\nsome distance below the Montanvert. I took the theodolite down the\r\nmountain-slope, wading at times breast-deep in snow, and having\r\nselected a line, the men tied themselves together as before, and\r\ncommenced the staking out. The work was slowly but steadily and\r\nsteadfastly done. The air darkened; angry clouds gathered around the\r\nmountains, and at times the glacier was swept by wild squalls. The men\r\nwere sometimes hidden from me by the clouds of snow which enveloped\r\nthem, but between those intermittent gusts there were intervals of\r\nrepose, which enabled us to prosecute our work. This line was more\r\ndifficult than the first one; the glacier was broken into sharp-edged\r\nchasms; the ridges to be climbed were steep, and the snow which filled\r\nthe depressions profound. The oblique arrangement of the crevasses also\r\nmagnified the labour by increasing the circuits. I saw the leader of the\r\nparty often shoulder-deep in snow, treading the soft mass as a swimmer\r\nwalks in water, and I felt a wish to be at his side to cheer him and to\r\nshare his toil. Each man there, however, knew my willingness to do this\r\nif occasion required it, and wrought contented. At length the last stake\r\nbeing fixed, the faces of the men were turned homeward. The evening\r\nbecame wilder, and the storm rose at times to a hurricane. On the more\r\nlevel portions of the glacier the snow lay deep and unsheltered; among\r\nits frozen waves and upon its more dislocated portions it had been\r\npartially engulfed, and the residue was more or less in shelter. Over\r\nthe former spaces dense clouds of snow rose, whirling in the air and\r\ncutting off all view of the glacier. The whole length of the Mer de\r\nGlace was thus divided into clear and cloudy segments, and presented an\r\naspect of wild and wonderful turmoil. A large pine stood near me, with\r\nits lowest branch spread out upon the surface of the snow; on this\r\nbranch I seated myself, and, sheltered by the trunk, waited until I saw\r\nmy men in safety. The wind caught the branches of the trees, shook down\r\ntheir loads of snow, and tossed it wildly in the air. Every mountain\r\ngave a quota to the storm. The scene was one of most impressive\r\ngrandeur, and the moan of the adjacent pines chimed in noble harmony\r\nwith the picture which addressed the eyes.\r\n\r\nAt length we all found ourselves in safety within doors. The windows\r\nshook violently. The tempest was however intermittent throughout, as if\r\nat each effort it had exhausted itself, and required time to recover its\r\nstrength. As I heard its heralding roar in the gullies of the mountains,\r\nand its subsequent onset against our habitation, I thought wistfully of\r\nmy stations, not knowing whether they would be able to retain their\r\npositions in the face of such a blast. That night however, as if the\r\nstorm had sung our lullaby, we all slept profoundly, having arranged to\r\ncommence our measurements as early as light permitted on the following\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEAVY SNOW. 1859.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 29th December.--\"Snow, heavy snow: it must have descended\r\nthroughout the entire night; the quantity freshly fallen is so great;\r\nthe atmosphere at seven o'clock is thick with the descending flakes.\" At\r\neight o'clock it cleared up a little, and I proceeded to my station,\r\nwhile the men advanced upon the glacier; but I had scarcely fixed my\r\ntheodolite when the storm recommenced. I had a man to clear away the\r\nsnow and otherwise assist me; he procured an old door from the hotel,\r\nand by rearing it upon its end sheltered the object-glass of the\r\ninstrument. Added to the flakes descending from the clouds was the\r\nspitting snow-dust raised by the wind, which for a time so blinded me\r\nthat I was unable to see the glacier. The measurement of the first stake\r\nwas very tedious, but practice afterwards enabled me to take advantage\r\nof the brief lulls and periods of partial clearness with which the storm\r\nwas interfused.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A MAN IN A CREVASSE. 1859.]\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock my telescope happened to be directed upon the men as\r\nthey struggled through the snow; all evidence of the deep track which\r\nthey had formed yesterday having been swept away. I saw the leader sink\r\nand suddenly disappear. He had stood over a concealed fissure, the roof\r\nof which had given way and he had dropped in. I observed a rapid\r\nmovement on the part of the remaining three men: they grouped themselves\r\nbeside the fissure, and in a moment the missing man was drawn from\r\nbetween its jaws. His disappearance and reappearance were both\r\nextraordinary. We had, as I have stated, provided for contingencies of\r\nthis kind, and the man's rescue was almost immediate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIX-RAYED CRYSTALS. 1859.]\r\n\r\nMy attendant brought two poles from the hotel which we thrust obliquely\r\ninto the snow, causing the free ends to cross each other; over these a\r\nblanket was thrown, behind which I sheltered myself from the storm as\r\nthe men proceeded from stake to stake. At 9.30 the storm was so thick\r\nthat I was unable to see the men at the stake which they had reached at\r\nthe time; the flakes sped wildly in their oblique course across the\r\nfield of the telescope. Some time afterwards the air became quite still,\r\nand the snow underwent a wonderful change. Frozen flowers similar to\r\nthose I had observed on Monte Rosa fell in myriads. For a long time the\r\nflakes were wholly composed of these exquisite blossoms entangled\r\ntogether. On the surface of my woollen dress they were soft as down; the\r\nsnow itself on which they fell seemed covered by a layer of down; while\r\nmy coat was completely spangled with six-rayed stars. And thus prodigal\r\nNature rained down beauty, and had done so here for ages unseen by man.\r\nAnd yet some flatter themselves with the idea that this world was\r\nplanned with strict reference to human use; that the lilies of the field\r\nexist simply to appeal to the sense of the beautiful in man. True, this\r\nresult is secured, but it is one of a thousand all equally important in\r\nthe eyes of Nature. Whence those frozen blossoms? Why for aeons wasted?\r\nThe question reminds one of the poet's answer when asked whence was the\r\nRhodora:--\r\n\r\n  \"Why wert thou there, O rival of the rose?\r\n    I never thought to ask, I never knew;\r\n  But in my simple ignorance suppose\r\n    The selfsame power that brought me there brought you!\"[A]\r\n\r\nI sketched some of the crystals, but, instead of reproducing these\r\nsketches, which were rough and hasty, I have annexed two of the forms\r\ndrawn with so much skill and patience by Mr. Glaisher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Snow Crystals.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Snow Crystals.]\r\n\r\nWe completed the measurement of the first line before eleven o'clock,\r\nand I felt great satisfaction in the thought that I possessed something\r\nof which the weather could not deprive me. As I closed my note-book and\r\nshifted the instrument to the second station, I felt that my expedition\r\nwas already a success.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past eleven I had my theodolite again fixed, and ranging\r\nthe telescope along the line of pickets, I saw them all standing.\r\nCrossing the ice wilderness, and suggesting the operation of\r\nintelligence amid that scene of desolation, their appearance was\r\npleasant to me. Just before I commenced, a solitary jay perched upon the\r\nsummit of an adjacent pine and watched me. The air was still at the\r\ntime, and the snow fell heavily. The flowers moreover were magnificent,\r\nvarying from about the twentieth of an inch to two lines in diameter,\r\nwhile, falling through the quiet air, their forms were perfect. Adjacent\r\nto my theodolite was a stump of pine, from which I had the snow removed,\r\nin order to have something to kick my toes against when they became\r\ncold; and on the stump was placed a blanket to be used as a screen in\r\ncase of need. While I remained at the station a layer of snow an inch\r\nthick fell upon this blanket, the whole layer being composed of these\r\nexquisite flowers. The atmosphere also was filled with them. From the\r\nclouds to the earth Nature was busy marshalling her atoms, and putting\r\nto shame by the beauty of her structures the comparative barbarities of\r\nArt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOUND THROUGH THE SNOW-STORM. 1859.]\r\n\r\nMy men at length reached the first station, and the measurement\r\ncommenced. The storm drifted up the valley, thickening all the air as it\r\napproached. Denser and denser the flakes fell; but still, with care and\r\ntact I was able to follow my party to a distance of 800 yards. I had not\r\nthought it possible to see so far through so dense a storm. At this\r\ndistance also my voice could be heard, and my instructions understood;\r\nfor once, as the man who took up the line stood behind his baton and\r\nprevented its projection against the white snow, I called out to him to\r\nstand aside, and he promptly did so. Throughout the entire measurement\r\nthe snow never ceased falling, and some of the illusions which it\r\nproduced were extremely singular. The distant boundary of the glacier\r\nappeared to rise to an extraordinary height, and the men wading through\r\nthe snow appeared as if climbing up a wall. The labour along this line\r\nwas still greater than on the former; on the steeper slopes especially\r\nthe toil was great; for here the effort of the leader to lift his own\r\nbody added itself to that of cutting his way through the snow. His\r\nfooting I could see often yielded, and he slid back, checking his\r\nrecession, however, by still plunging forward; thus, though the limbs\r\nwere incessantly exerted, it was, for a time, a mere motion of vibration\r\nwithout any sensible translation. At the last stake the men shouted,\r\n\"_Nous avons finis!_\" and I distinctly heard them through the falling\r\nsnow. By this time I was quite covered with the crystals which clung to\r\nmy wrapper. They also formed a heap upon my theodolite, rising over the\r\nspirit-levels and embracing the lower portion of the vertical arc. The\r\nwork was done; I struck my theodolite and ascended to the hotel; the\r\ngreatest depth of snow through which I waded reaching, when I stood\r\nerect, to within three inches of my breast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SWIFT DESCENT. 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe men returned; dinner was prepared and consumed; the disorder which\r\nwe had created made good; the rooms were swept, the mattresses replaced,\r\nand the shutters fastened, where this was possible. We locked up the\r\nhouse, and with light hearts and lithe limbs commenced the descent. My\r\naim now was to reach the source of the Arveiron, to examine the water\r\nand inspect the vault. With this view we went straight down the\r\nmountain. The inclinations were often extremely steep, and down these we\r\nswept with an avalanche-velocity; indeed usually accompanied by an\r\navalanche of our own creation. On one occasion Balmat was for a moment\r\noverwhelmed by the descending mass: the guides were startled, but he\r\nemerged instantly. Tairraz followed him, and I followed Tairraz, all of\r\nus rolling in the snow at the bottom of the slope as if it were so much\r\nflour. My practice on the Finsteraarhorn rendered me at home here. One\r\nof the porters could by no means be induced to try this flying mode of\r\ndescent. Simond carried my theodolite box, tied upon a crotchet on his\r\nback; and once, while shooting down a slope, he incautiously allowed a\r\nfoot to get entangled; his momentum rolled him over and over down the\r\nincline, the theodolite emerging periodically from the snow during his\r\nsuccessive revolutions. A succession of _glissades_ brought us with\r\namazing celerity to the bottom of the mountain, whence we picked our way\r\namid the covered boulders and over the concealed arms of the stream to\r\nthe source of the Arveiron.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water issuing from the vault was considerable, and its\r\ncharacter that of true glacier water. It was turbid with suspended\r\nmatter, though not so turbid as in summer; but the difference in force\r\nand quantity would, I think, be sufficient to account for the greater\r\nsummer turbidity. This character of the water could only be due to the\r\ngrinding motion of the glacier upon its bed; a motion which seems not to\r\nbe suspended even in the depth of winter. The temperature of the water\r\nwas the tenth of a degree Centigrade above zero; that of the ice was\r\nhalf a degree below zero: this was also the temperature of the air,\r\nwhile that of the snow, which in some places covered the ice-blocks, was\r\na degree and a quarter below zero.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VAULT OF THE ARVEIRON. 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the vault was formed by an arch of ice which had\r\ndetached itself from the general mass of the glacier behind: between\r\nthem was a space through which we could look to the sky above. Beyond\r\nthis the cave narrowed, and we found ourselves steeped in the blue light\r\nof the ice. The roof of the inner arch was perforated at one place by a\r\nshaft about a yard wide, which ran vertically to the surface of the\r\nglacier. Water had run down the sides of this shaft, and, being\r\nre-frozen below, formed a composite pillar of icicles at least twenty\r\nfeet high and a yard thick, stretching quite from roof to floor. They\r\nwere all united to a common surface at one side, but at the other they\r\nformed a series of flutings of exceeding beauty. This group of columns\r\nwas bent at its base as if it had yielded to the forward motion of the\r\nglacier, or to the weight of the arch overhead. Passing over a number of\r\nlarge ice-blocks which partially filled the interior of the vault, we\r\nreached its extremity, and here found a sloping passage with a perfect\r\narch of crystal overhead, and leading by a steep gradient to the air\r\nabove. This singular gallery was about seventy feet long, and was\r\nfloored with snow. We crept up it, and from the summit descended by a\r\nglissade to the frontal portion of the cavern. To me this crystal cave,\r\nwith the blue light glistening from its walls, presented an aspect of\r\nmagical beauty. My delight, however, was tame compared with that of my\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAJESTIC SCENE. 1859.]\r\n\r\nLooking from the blue arch westwards, the heavens were seen filled by\r\ncrimson clouds, with fiery outliers reaching up to the zenith. On\r\nquitting the vault I turned to have a last look at those noble sentinels\r\nof the Mer de Glace, the Aiguille du Dru, and the Aiguille Verte. The\r\nglacier below the mountains was in shadow, and its frozen precipices of\r\na deep cold blue. From this, as from a basis, the mountain cones sprang\r\nsteeply heavenward, meeting half way down the fiery light of the sinking\r\nsun. The right-hand slopes and edges of both pyramids burned in this\r\nlight, while detached protuberant masses also caught the blaze, and\r\nmottled the mountains with effulgent spaces. A range of minor peaks ran\r\nslanting downwards from the summit of the Aiguille Verte; some of these\r\nwere covered with snow, and shone as if illuminated with the deep\r\ncrimson of a strontian flame. I was absolutely struck dumb by the\r\nextraordinary majesty of this scene, and watched it silently till the\r\nred light faded from the highest summits. Thus ended my winter\r\nexpedition to the Mer de Glace.\r\n\r\nNext morning, starting at three o'clock, I was driven by my two guides\r\nin an open sledge to Sallenches. The rain was pitiless and the road\r\nabominable. The distance, I believe, is only six leagues, but it took us\r\nfive hours to accomplish it. The leading mule was beyond the reach of\r\nSimond's whip, and proved a mere obstructive; during part of the way it\r\nwas unloosed, tied to the sledge, and dragged after it. Simond\r\nafterwards mounted the hindmost beast and brought his whip to bear upon\r\nthe leader, the jerking he endured for an hour and a half seemed almost\r\nsufficient to dislocate his bones. We reached Sallenches half an hour\r\nlate, but the diligence was behind its time by this exact interval. We\r\nmet it on the Pont St. Martin, and I transferred myself from the sledge\r\nto the interior. This was the morning of the 30th of December, and on\r\nthe evening of the 1st of January I was in London.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MY ASSISTANTS. 1859.]\r\n\r\nI cannot finish this recital without saying one word about my men. Their\r\nbehaviour was admirable throughout. The labour was enormous, but it was\r\nmanfully and cheerfully done. I know Simond well; he is intelligent,\r\ntruthful, and affectionate, and there is no guide of my acquaintance for\r\nwhom I have a stronger regard. Joseph Tairraz is an extremely\r\nintelligent and able guide, and on this trying occasion proved himself\r\nworthy of my highest praise and commendation. Their two companions upon\r\nthe glacier, Edouard Balmat (le Petit Balmat) and Joseph Simond (fils\r\nd'Auguste), acquitted themselves admirably; and it also gives me\r\npleasure to bear testimony to the willing and efficient service of\r\nFrancois Ravanal, who attended upon me during the observations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Emerson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nCHIEFLY SCIENTIFIC.\r\n\r\n  Aber im stillen Gemach entwirft bedeutende Zirkel\r\n    Sinnend der Weise, beschleicht forschend den schaffenden Geist,\r\n  Prueft der Stoffe Gewalt, der Magnete Hassen und Lieben,\r\n    Folgt durch die Luefte dem Klang, folgt durch den Aether dem Strahl,\r\n  Sucht das vertraute Gesetz in des Zufalls grausenden Wundern,\r\n    Sucht den ruhenden Pol in der Erscheinungen Flucht.\r\n\r\n                                        Schiller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON LIGHT AND HEAT.\r\n\r\n(1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEORIES OF LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nWhat is Light? The ancients supposed it to be something emitted by the\r\neyes, and for ages no notion was entertained that it required time to\r\npass through space. In the year 1676 Roemer first proved that the light\r\nfrom Jupiter's satellites required a certain time to cross the earth's\r\norbit. Bradley afterwards found that, owing to the velocity with which\r\nthe earth flies through space, the rays of the stars are slightly\r\ninclined, just as rain-drops which descend vertically appear to meet us\r\nwhen we move swiftly through the shower. In Kew Gardens there is a\r\nsun-dial commemorative of this discovery, which is called the\r\n_aberration of light_. Knowing the velocity of the earth, and the\r\ninclination of the stellar rays, Bradley was able to calculate the\r\nvelocity of light; and his result agrees closely with that of Roemer.\r\nCelestial distances were here involved, but a few years ago M. Fizeau,\r\nby an extremely ingenious contrivance, determined the time required by\r\nlight to pass over a distance of about 9000 yards; and his experiment is\r\nquite in accordance with the results of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nBut what is it which thus moves? Some, and among the number Newton,\r\nimagined light to consist of particles darted out from luminous bodies.\r\nThis is the so-called Emission-Theory, which was held by some of the\r\ngreatest men: Laplace, for example, accepted it; and M. Biot has\r\ndeveloped it with a lucidity and power peculiar to himself. It was first\r\nopposed by the astronomer Huyghens, and afterwards by Euler, both of\r\nwhom supposed light to be a kind of undulatory motion; but they were\r\nborne down by their great antagonists, and the emission-theory held its\r\nground until the commencement of the present century, when Thomas Young,\r\nProfessor of Natural Philosophy in the Royal Institution, reversed the\r\nscientific creed by placing the Theory of Undulation on firm\r\nfoundations. He was followed by a young Frenchman of extraordinary\r\ngenius, who, by the force of his logic and the conclusiveness of his\r\nexperiments, left the Wave-Theory without a competitor. The name of this\r\nyoung Frenchman was Augustin Fresnel.\r\n\r\nSince his time some of the ablest minds in Europe have been applied to\r\nthe investigation of this subject; and thus a mastery, almost\r\nmiraculous, has been attained over the grandest and most subtle of\r\nnatural phenomena. True knowledge is always fruitful, and a clear\r\nconception regarding any one natural agent leads infallibly to better\r\nnotions regarding others. Thus it is that our knowledge of light has\r\ncorrected and expanded our knowledge of _heat_, while the latter, in its\r\nturn, will assuredly lead us to clearer conceptions regarding the other\r\nforces of Nature.\r\n\r\nI think it will not be a useless labour if I here endeavour to state, in\r\na simple manner, our present views of light and heat. Such knowledge is\r\nessential to the explanation of many of the phenomena referred to in the\r\nforegoing pages; and even to the full comprehension of the origin of the\r\nglaciers themselves. A few remarks on the nature of sound will form a\r\nfit introduction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATURE OF SOUND.]\r\n\r\nIt is known that sound is conveyed to our organs of hearing by the air:\r\na bell struck in a vacuum emits no sound, and even when the air is thin\r\nthe sound is enfeebled. Hawksbee proved this by the air-pump; De\r\nSaussure fired a pistol at the top of Mont Blanc,--I have repeated the\r\nexperiment myself, and found, with him, that the sound is feebler than\r\nat the sea level. Sound is not produced by anything projected through\r\nthe air. The explosion of a gun, for example, is sent forward by a\r\nmotion of a totally different kind from that which animates the bullet\r\nprojected from the gun: the latter is a motion of _translation_; the\r\nformer, one of _vibration_. To use a rough comparison, sound is\r\nprojected through the air as a push is through a crowd; it is the\r\npropagation of a _wave_ or _pulse_, each particle taking up the motion\r\nof its neighbour, and delivering it on to the next. These aerial waves\r\nenter the external ear, meet a membrane, the so-called tympanic\r\nmembrane, which is drawn across the passage at a certain place, and\r\nbreak upon it as sea-waves do upon the shore. The membrane is shaken,\r\nits tremors are communicated to the auditory nerve, and transmitted by\r\nit to the brain, where they produce the impression to which we give the\r\nname of sound.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSE OF MUSIC.]\r\n\r\nIn the tumult of a city, pulses of different kinds strike irregularly\r\nupon the tympanum, and we call the effect _noise_; but when a succession\r\nof impulses reach the ear _at regular intervals_ we feel the effect as\r\n_music_. Thus, a vibrating string imparts a series of shocks to the air\r\naround it, which are transmitted with perfect regularity to the ear, and\r\nproduce a _musical note_. When we hear the song of a soaring lark we may\r\nbe sure that the entire atmosphere between us and the bird is filled\r\nwith pulses, or undulations, or waves, as they are often called,\r\nproduced by the little songster's organ of voice. This organ is a\r\nvibrating instrument, resembling, in principle, the reed of a clarionet.\r\nLet us suppose that we hear the song of a lark, elevated to a height of\r\n500 feet in the air. Before this is possible, the bird must have\r\nagitated a sphere of air 1000 feet in diameter; that is to say, it must\r\nhave communicated to 17,888 tons of air a motion sufficiently intense to\r\nbe appreciated by our organs of hearing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSE OF PITCH.]\r\n\r\nMusical sounds differ in _pitch_: some notes are high and shrill, others\r\nlow and deep. Boys are chosen as choristers to produce the shrill\r\nnotes; men are chosen to produce the bass notes. Now, the sole\r\ndifference here is, that the boy's organ vibrates _more rapidly_ than\r\nthe man's--it sends a greater number of impulses per second to the ear.\r\nIn like manner, a short string emits a higher note than a long one,\r\nbecause it vibrates more quickly. The greater the number of vibrations\r\nwhich any instrument performs in a given time, the higher will be the\r\npitch of the note produced. The reason why the hum of a gnat is shriller\r\nthan that of a beetle is that the wings of the small insect vibrate more\r\nquickly than those of the larger one. We can, with suitable\r\narrangements, make those sonorous vibrations visible to the eye;[A] and\r\nwe also possess instruments which enable us to tell, with the utmost\r\nexactitude, the number of vibrations due to any particular note. By such\r\ninstruments we learn that a gnat can execute many thousand flaps of its\r\nlittle wings in a second of time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATURE OF LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nIn the study of nature the coarser phenomena, which come under the\r\ncognizance of the senses, often suggest to us the finer phenomena which\r\ncome under the cognizance of the mind; and thus the vibrations which\r\nproduce sound, and which, as has been stated, can be rendered visible to\r\nthe eye by proper means, first suggested that _light_ might be due to a\r\nsomewhat similar action. This is now the universal belief. A luminous\r\nbody is supposed to have its atoms, or molecules, in a state of intense\r\nvibration. The motions of the atoms are supposed to be communicated to\r\na medium suited to their transmission, as air is to the transmission of\r\nsound. This medium is called the _luminiferous ether_, and the little\r\nbillows excited in it speed through it with amazing celerity, enter the\r\npupil of the eye, pass through the humours, and break upon the retina or\r\noptic nerve, which is spread out at the back of the eye. Hence the\r\ntremors they produce are transmitted along the nerve to the brain, where\r\nthey announce themselves as _light_. The swiftness with which the waves\r\nof light are propagated through the ether, is however enormously greater\r\nthan that with which the waves of sound pass through the air. An aerial\r\nwave of sound travels at about the rate of 1100 feet in a second: a wave\r\nof light leaves 192,000 miles behind it in the same time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSE OF COLOUR.]\r\n\r\nThus, then, in the case of sound, we have the sonorous body, the air,\r\nand the auditory nerve, concerned in the phenomenon; in the case of\r\nlight, we have the luminous body, the ether, and the optic nerve. The\r\nfundamental analogy of sound and light is thus before us, and it is\r\neasily remembered. But we must push the analogy further. We know that\r\nthe white light which comes to us from the sun is made up of an infinite\r\nnumber of coloured rays. By refraction with a prism we can separate\r\nthose rays from each other, and arrange them in the series of colours\r\nwhich constitute the solar spectrum. The rainbow is an imperfect or\r\n_impure_ spectrum, produced by the drops of falling rain, but by prisms\r\nwe can unravel the white light into pure red, orange, yellow, green,\r\nblue, indigo, and violet. Now, this spectrum is to the eye what the\r\ngamut is to the ear; each colour represents a note, and _the different\r\ncolours represent notes of different pitch_. The vibrations which\r\nproduce the impression of red are _slower_, and the waves which they\r\nproduce are _longer_, than those to which we owe the sensation of\r\nviolet; while the vibrations which excite the other colours are\r\nintermediate between these two extremes. This, then, is the second grand\r\nanalogy between light and sound: _Colour answers to Pitch_. There is\r\ntherefore truth in the figure when we say that the gentian of the Alps\r\nsings a shriller note than the wild rhododendron, and that the red glow\r\nof the mountains at sunset is of a lower pitch than the blue of the\r\nfirmament at noon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LENGTH OF ETHEREAL WAVES.]\r\n\r\nThese are not fanciful analogies. To the mind of the philosopher these\r\nwaves of ether are almost as palpable and certain as the waves of the\r\nsea, or the ripples on the surface of a lake. The length of the waves,\r\nboth of sound and light, and the number of shocks which they\r\nrespectively impart to the ear and eye, have been the subjects of the\r\nstrictest measurement. Let us here go through a simple calculation. It\r\nhas been found that 39,000 waves of red light placed end to end would\r\nmake up an inch. How many inches are there in 192,000 miles? My youngest\r\nreader can make the calculation for himself, and find the answer to be\r\n12,165,120,000 inches. It is evident that, if we multiply this number by\r\n39,000, we shall obtain the number of waves of red light in 192,000\r\nmiles; this number is 474,439,680,000,000. _All these waves enter the\r\neye in one second_; thus the expression \"I see red colour,\" strictly\r\nmeans, \"My eye is now in receipt of four hundred and seventy-four\r\nmillions of millions of impulses per second.\" To produce the impression\r\nof violet light a still greater number of impulses is necessary; the\r\nwave-length of violet is the 1/57500th part of an inch, and the number\r\nof shocks imparted in a second by waves of this length is, in round\r\nnumbers, six hundred and ninety-nine millions of millions. The other\r\ncolours of the spectrum, as already stated, rise gradually in pitch from\r\nthe red to the violet.\r\n\r\nA very curious analogy between the eye and ear may here be noticed. The\r\nrange of seeing is different in different persons--some see a longer\r\nspectrum than others; that is to say, rays which are obscure to some are\r\nluminous to others. Dr. Wollaston pointed out a similar fact as regards\r\nhearing; the range of which differs in different individuals. Savart has\r\nshown that a good ear can hear a musical note produced by 8 shocks in a\r\nsecond; it can also hear a note produced by 24,000 shocks in a second;\r\nbut there are ears in which the range is much more limited. It is\r\npossible indeed to produce a sound which shall be painfully shrill to\r\none person, while it is quite unheard by another. I once crossed a Swiss\r\nmountain in company with a friend; a donkey was in advance of us, and\r\nthe dull tramp of the animal was plainly heard by my companion; but to\r\nme this sound was almost masked by the shrill chirruping of innumerable\r\ninsects which thronged the adjacent grass; my friend heard nothing of\r\nthis, it lay quite beyond his range of hearing.\r\n\r\nA third and most important analogy between sound and light is now to be\r\nnoted; and it will be best understood by reference to something more\r\ntangible than either. When a stone is thrown into calm water a series of\r\nrings spread themselves around the centre of disturbance. If a second\r\nstone be thrown in at some distance from the first, the rings emanating\r\nfrom both centres will cross each other, and at those points where the\r\nridge of one wave coincides with the ridge of another the water will be\r\nlifted to a greater height. At those points, on the contrary, where the\r\nridge of one wave crosses the furrow of another, we have both\r\nobliterated, and the water restored to its ordinary level. Where two\r\nridges or two furrows unite, we have a case of _coincidence_; but where\r\na ridge and a furrow unite we have what is called _interference_. It is\r\nquite possible to send two systems of waves into the same channel, and\r\nto hold back one system a little, so that its ridges shall coincide\r\nwith the furrows of the other system. The \"interference\" would be here\r\ncomplete, and the waves thus circumstanced would mutually destroy each\r\nother, smooth water being the result. In this way, by the addition of\r\nmotion to motion, _rest_ may be produced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIGHT ADDED TO LIGHT MAKES DARKNESS.]\r\n\r\nIn a precisely similar manner two systems of sonorous waves can be\r\ncaused to interfere and mutually to destroy each other: thus, by adding\r\nsound to sound, _silence_ may be produced. Two beams of light also may\r\nbe caused to interfere and effect their mutual extinction: thus, by\r\nadding light to light, we can produce _darkness_. Here indeed we have a\r\ncritical analogy between sound and light--_the_ one, in fact, which\r\ncompels the most profound thinkers of the present day to assume that\r\nlight, like sound, is a case of undulatory motion.\r\n\r\nWe see here the vision of the intellect prolonged beyond the boundaries\r\nof sense into the region of what might be considered mere imagination.\r\nBut, unlike other imaginations, we can bring ours to the test of\r\nexperiment; indeed, so great a mastery have we obtained over these\r\nwaves, which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, that we can with\r\nmathematical certainty cause them to coincide or to interfere, to help\r\neach other or to destroy each other, at pleasure. It is perhaps possible\r\nto be a little more precise here. Let two stones--with a small distance\r\nbetween them--be dropped into water at the same moment; a system of\r\ncircular waves will be formed round each stone. Let the distance from\r\none little crest to the next following one be called _the length of the\r\nwave_, and now let us inquire what will take place at a point equally\r\ndistant from the places where the two stones were dropped in. Fixing our\r\nattention upon the ridge of the first wave in each case, it is manifest\r\nthat, as the water propagates both systems with the same velocity, the\r\ntwo foremost ridges will reach the point in question at the same\r\nmoment; the ridge of one would therefore coincide with the ridge of the\r\nother, and the water at this point would be lifted to a height greater\r\nthan that of either of the previous ridges.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COINCIDENCE AND INTERFERENCE.]\r\n\r\nAgain, supposing that by any means we had it in our power to retard one\r\nsystem of waves so as to cause the first ridge of the one to be exactly\r\none wave length behind the first ridge of the other, when they arrive at\r\nthe point referred to. It is plain that the first ridge of the retarded\r\nsystem now falls in with the second ridge of the unretarded system, and\r\nwe have another case of coincidence. A little reflection will show the\r\nsame to be true when one system is retarded any number of _whole\r\nwave-lengths_; the first ridge of the retarded system will always, at\r\nthe point referred to, coincide with a _ridge_ of the unretarded system.\r\n\r\nBut now suppose the one system to be retarded only _half a wave-length_;\r\nit is perfectly clear that, in this case the first ridge of the retarded\r\nsystem would fall in with the first _furrow_ of the unretarded system,\r\nand instead of coincidence we should have interference. One system, in\r\nfact, would tend to make a hollow at the point referred to, the other\r\nwould tend to make a hill, and thus the two systems would oppose and\r\nneutralize each other, so that neither the hollow nor the hill would be\r\nproduced; the water would maintain its ordinary level. What is here said\r\nof a single half-wave-length of retardation, is also true if the\r\nretardation amount to any _odd_ number of half-wave-lengths. In all such\r\ncases we should have the ridge of the one system falling in with the\r\nfurrow of the other; a mutual destruction of the waves of both systems\r\nbeing the consequence. The same remarks apply when the point, instead of\r\nbeing equally distant from both stones, is an even or an odd number of\r\nsemi-undulations farther from the one than from the other. In the former\r\ncase we should have coincidence, and in the latter case interference,\r\nat the point in question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIQUID WAVES.]\r\n\r\nTo the eye of a person who understands these things, nothing can be more\r\ninteresting than the rippling of water under certain circumstances. By\r\nthe action of interference its surface is sometimes shivered into the\r\nmost beautiful mosaic, shifting and trembling as if with a kind of\r\nvisible music. When the tide advances over a sea-beach on a calm and\r\nsunny day, and its tiny ripples enter, at various points, the clear\r\nshallow pools which the preceding tide had left behind, the little\r\nwavelets run and climb and cross each other, and thus form a lovely\r\n_chasing_, which has its counterpart in the lines of light converged by\r\nthe ripples upon the sand underneath. When waves are skilfully generated\r\nin a vessel of mercury, and a strong light reflected from the surface of\r\nthe metal is received upon a screen, the most beautiful effects may be\r\nobserved. The shape of the vessel determines, in part, the character of\r\nthe figures produced; in a circular dish of mercury, for example, a\r\ndisturbance at the centre propagates itself in circular waves, which\r\nafter reflection again encircle the centre. If the point of disturbance\r\nbe a little removed from the centre, the intersections of the direct and\r\nreflected waves produce the magnificent chasing shown in the annexed\r\nfigure (16), which I have borrowed from the excellent work on Waves by\r\nthe Messrs. Weber. The luminous figure reflected from such a surface is\r\nexceedingly beautiful. When the mercury is lightly struck by a glass\r\npoint, in a direction concentric with the circumference of the vessel,\r\nthe lines of light run round the vessel in mazy coils, interlacing and\r\nunravelling themselves in the most wonderful manner. If the vessel be\r\nsquare, a splendid mosaic is produced by the crossing of the direct and\r\nreflected waves. Description, however, can give but a feeble idea of\r\nthese exquisite effects;--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou canst not wave thy staff in the air,\r\n    Or dip thy paddle in the lake,\r\n  But it carves the brow of beauty there,\r\n    And the ripples in rhymes the oar forsake.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHASING PRODUCED BY WAVES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Chasing produced by waves.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EFFECT OF RETARDATION.]\r\n\r\nNow, all that we have said regarding the retardation of the waves of\r\nwater, by a whole undulation and a semi-undulation, is perfectly\r\napplicable to the case of light. Two luminous points may be placed near\r\nto each other so as to resemble the two stones dropped into the water;\r\nand when the light of these is properly received upon a screen, or\r\ndirectly upon the retina, we find that at some places the action of the\r\nrays upon each other produces darkness, and at others augmented light.\r\nThe former places are those where the rays emitted from one point are an\r\n_odd_ number of semi-undulations in advance of the rays sent from the\r\nother; the latter places are those where the difference of path\r\ndescribed by the rays is either nothing, or an _even_ number of\r\nsemi-undulations. Supposing _a_ and _b_ (Fig. 17) to be two such\r\nsources of light, and S R a screen on which the light falls; at a point\r\n_l_, equally distant from _a_ and _b_, we have _light_; at a point _d_,\r\nwhere _a d_ is half an undulation longer than _b d_, we have darkness;\r\nat _l'_, where _a l'_ is a whole wave-length, or two semi-undulations,\r\nlonger than _b l'_, we again have light; and at a point _d'_, where the\r\ndifference is three semi-undulations, we have darkness; and thus we\r\nobtain a series of bright and dark spaces as we recede laterally from\r\nthe central point _l_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Diagram explanatory of Interference.]\r\n\r\nLet a bit of tin foil be closely pasted upon a piece of glass, and the\r\nedge of a penknife drawn across the foil so as to produce a slit.\r\nLooking through this slit at a small and distant light, we find the\r\nlight spread out in a direction at right angles to the slit, and if the\r\nlight looked at be _monochromatic_, that is, composed of a single\r\ncolour, we shall have a series of bright and dark bars corresponding to\r\nthe points at which the rays from the different points of the slit\r\nalternately coincide and interfere upon the retina. By properly\r\ndrawing a knife across a sheet of letter-paper a suitable slit may also\r\nbe obtained; and those practised in such things can obtain the effect by\r\nlooking through their fingers or their eyelashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERFERENCE SPECTRA, PRODUCED BY DIFFRACTION.\r\nFig. 18. _To face_ p. 235.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHROMATIC EFFECTS.]\r\n\r\nBut if the light looked at be white, the light of a candle for example,\r\nor of a jet of gas, instead of having a series of bright and dark bars,\r\nwe have the bars _coloured_. And see how beautifully this harmonizes\r\nwith what has been already said regarding the different lengths of the\r\nwaves which produce different colours. Looking again at Fig. 17 we see\r\nthat a certain obliquity is necessary to cause one ray to be a whole\r\nundulation in advance of the other at the point _l'_; but it is\r\nperfectly manifest that the obliquity must depend upon the length of the\r\nundulation; a long undulation would require a greater obliquity than a\r\nshort one; red light, for example, requires a greater obliquity than\r\nblue light; so that if the point _l'_ represents the place where the\r\nfirst bar of red light would be at its maximum strength, the maximum for\r\nblue would lie a little to the left of _l'_; the different colours are\r\nin this way separated from each other, and exhibit themselves as\r\ndistinct fringes when a distant source of white light is regarded\r\nthrough a narrow slit.\r\n\r\nBy varying the shape of the aperture we alter the form of the chromatic\r\nimage. A circular aperture, for example, placed in front of a telescope\r\nthrough which a point of white light is regarded, is seen surrounded by\r\na concentric system of coloured rings. If we multiply our slits or\r\napertures the phenomena augment in complexity and splendour. To give\r\nsome notion of this I have copied from the excellent work of M. Schwerd\r\nthe annexed figure (Fig. 18) which represents the gorgeous effect\r\nobserved when a distant point of light is looked at through two gratings\r\nwith slits of different widths.[B] A bird's feather represents a\r\npeculiar system of slits, and the effect observed on properly looking\r\nthrough it is extremely interesting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COLOURS OF THIN FILMS.]\r\n\r\nThere are many ways by which the retardation necessary to the production\r\nof interference is effected. The splendid colours of a soap-bubble are\r\nentirely due to interference; the beam falling upon the transparent film\r\nis partially reflected at its outer surface, but a portion of it enters\r\nthe film and is reflected at its _inner_ surface. The latter portion\r\nhaving crossed the film and returned, is retarded, in comparison with\r\nthe former, and, if the film be of suitable thickness, these two beams\r\nwill clash and extinguish each other, while another thickness will cause\r\nthe beams to coincide and illuminate the film with a light of greater\r\nintensity. From what has been said it must be manifest that to make two\r\nred beams thus coincide a thicker film would be required than would be\r\nnecessary for two blue or green beams; thus, when the thickness of the\r\nbubble is suitable for the development of red, it is not suitable for\r\nthe development of green, blue, &c.; the consequence is that we have\r\ndifferent colours at different parts of the bubble. Owing to its\r\ncompactness and to its being shaded by a covering of debris from the\r\ndirect heat of the sun, the ice underneath the moraines of glaciers\r\nappears sometimes of a pitchy blackness. While cutting such ice with my\r\naxe I have often been surprised and delighted by sudden flashes of\r\ncoloured light which broke like fire from the mass. These flashes were\r\ndue to internal rupture, by which fissures were produced as thin as the\r\nfilm of a soap-bubble; the colours being due to the interference of the\r\nlight reflected from the opposite sides of the fissures.\r\n\r\nIf spirit of turpentine, or olive oil, be thrown upon water, it speedily\r\nspreads in a thin film over the surface, and the most gorgeous\r\nchromatic phenomena may be thus produced. Oil of lemons is also\r\npeculiarly suited to this experiment. If water be placed in a tea-tray,\r\nand light of sufficient intensity be suffered to fall upon it, this\r\nlight will be reflected from the upper and under surfaces of the film of\r\noil, and the colours thus produced may be received upon a screen, and\r\nseen at once by many hundred persons. If the oil of cinnamon be used,\r\nfine colours are also obtained, and the breaking up of this film\r\nexhibits a most interesting case of molecular action. By using a kind of\r\nvarnish, instead of oil, Mr. Delarue has imparted such tenacity to these\r\nfilms that they may be removed from the water on which they rest and\r\npreserved for any length of time. By such films the colours of certain\r\nbeetles, and of the wings of certain insects, may be accurately\r\nimitated; and a rook's feather may be made to shine with magnificent\r\niridescences. The colours of tempered metals, and the beautiful\r\nmetallochrome of Nobili are also due to a similar cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFRACTION.]\r\n\r\nThese colours are called the colours of _thin plates_, and are\r\ndistinguished in treatises on optics from the coloured bars and fringes\r\nabove referred to, which are produced by _diffraction_, or the bending\r\nof the waves round the edge of an object. One result of this bending,\r\nwhich is of interest to us, was obtained by the celebrated Thomas Young.\r\nPermitting a beam of sunlight to enter a dark room through an aperture\r\nmade with a fine needle, and placing in the path of the beam a bit of\r\ncard one-thirtieth of an inch wide, he found the shadow of this card, or\r\nrather the line on which its shadow might be supposed to fall, always\r\n_bright_; and he proved the effect to be due to the bending of the waves\r\nof ether round the two edges of the card, and their coincidence at the\r\nother side. It has, indeed, been shown by M. Poisson, that the centre of\r\nthe shadow of a small circular opaque disk which stands in the way of a\r\nbeam diverging from a point is exactly as much illuminated as if the\r\ndisk were absent. The singular effects described by M. Necker in the\r\nletter quoted at page 178 at once suggest themselves here; and we see\r\nhow possible it is for the solar rays, in grazing a distant tree, so to\r\nbend round it as to produce upon the retina, where shadow might be\r\nexpected, the impression of a tree of light.[C] Another effect of\r\ndiffraction is especially interesting to us at present. Let the seed of\r\nlycopodium be scattered over a glass plate, or even like a cloud in the\r\nair, and let a distant point of light be regarded through it; the\r\nluminous point will appear surrounded by a series of coloured rings, and\r\nwhen the light is intense, like the electric or the Drummond light, the\r\neffect is exceedingly fine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLOUD IRIDESCENCE, ETC., EXPLAINED.]\r\n\r\nAnd now for the application of these experiments. I have already\r\nmentioned a series of coloured rings observed around the sun by Mr.\r\nHuxley and myself from the Rhone glacier; I have also referred to the\r\ncloud iridescences on the Aletschhorn; and to the colours observed\r\nduring my second ascent of Monte Rosa, the magnificence of which is\r\nneither to be rendered by pigments nor described in words. All these\r\nsplendid phenomena are, I believe, produced by diffraction, the vesicles\r\nor spherules of water in the case of the cloud acting the part of the\r\nsporules in the case of the lycopodium. The coloured fringe which\r\nsurrounds the _Spirit of the Brocken_, and the spectra which I have\r\nspoken of as surrounding the sun, are also produced by diffraction. By\r\nthe interference of their rays in the earth's atmosphere the stars can\r\nmomentarily quench themselves; and probably to an intermittent action of\r\nthis kind their twinkling, and the swift chromatic changes already\r\nmentioned, are due. Does not all this sound more like a fairy tale than\r\nthe sober conclusions of science? What effort of the imagination could\r\ntranscend the realities here presented to us? The ancients had their\r\nspheral melodies, but have not we ours, which only want a sense\r\nsufficiently refined to hear them? Immensity is filled with this music;\r\nwherever a star sheds its light its notes are heard. Our sun, for\r\nexample, thrills concentric waves through space, and every luminous\r\npoint that gems our skies is surrounded by a similar system. I have\r\nspoken of the rising, climbing and crossing of the tiny ripples of a\r\ncalm tide upon a smooth strand; but what are they to those intersecting\r\nripples of the \"uncontinented deep\" by which Infinity is engine-turned!\r\nCrossing solar and stellar distances, they bring us the light of sun and\r\nstars; thrilled back from our atmosphere, they give us the blue radiance\r\nof the sky; rounding liquid spherules, they clash at the other side, and\r\nthe survivors of the tumult bear to our vision the wondrous cloud-dyes\r\nof Monte Rosa.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The vibrations of the air of a room in which a musical instrument is\r\nsounded may be made manifest by the way in which fine sand arranges\r\nitself upon a thin stretched membrane over which it is strewn; and\r\nindeed Savart has thus rendered visible the vibrations of the tympanum\r\nitself. Every trace of sand was swept from a paper drum held in the\r\nclock-tower of Westminster when the Great Bell was sounded. Another way\r\nof showing the propagation of aerial pulses is to insert a small gas jet\r\ninto a vertical glass tube about a foot in length, in which the flame\r\nmay be caused to burn tranquilly. On pitching the voice to the note of\r\nan open tube a foot long, the little flame quivers, stretches itself,\r\nand responds by producing a clear melodious note of the same pitch as\r\nthat which excited it. The flame will continue its song for hours\r\nwithout intermission.\r\n\r\n[B] I am not aware whether in his own country, or in any other, a\r\nrecognition at all commensurate with the value of the performance has\r\nfollowed Schwerd's admirable essay entitled 'The Phenomena of\r\nDiffraction deduced from the Theory of Undulation.'\r\n\r\n[C] I think, however, that the strong irradiation from the glistening\r\nsides of the twigs and branches must also contribute to the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RADIANT HEAT.]\r\n\r\n(2.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, then, we have been led from Sound to Light, and light now in its\r\nturn will lead us to _Radiant Heat_; for in the order in which they are\r\nhere mentioned the conviction arose that they are all three different\r\nkinds of motion. It has been said that the beams of the sun consist of\r\nrays of different colours, but this is not a complete statement of the\r\ncase. The sun emits a multitude of rays which are perfectly\r\nnon-luminous; and the same is true, in a still greater degree, of our\r\nartificial sources of illumination. Measured by the quantity of heat\r\nwhich they produce, 90 per cent. of the rays emanating from a flame of\r\noil are obscure; while 99 out of every 100 of those which emanate from\r\nan alcohol flame are of the same description.[A]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OBSCURE RAYS.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the visible solar spectrum simply embraces an interval of rays\r\nof which the eye is formed to take cognizance, but it by no means marks\r\nthe limits of solar action. Beyond the violet end of the spectrum we\r\nhave obscure rays capable of producing chemical changes, and beyond the\r\nred we have rays possessing a high heating power, but incapable of\r\nexciting the impression of light. This latter fact was first established\r\nby Sir William Herschel, and it has been amply corroborated since.\r\n\r\nThe belief now universally prevalent is, that the rays of heat differ\r\nfrom the rays of light simply as one colour differs from another. As the\r\nwaves which produce red are longer than those which produce yellow, so\r\nthe waves which produce this obscure heat are longer than those which\r\nproduce red. In fact, it may be shown that the longest waves never reach\r\nthe retina at all; they are completely absorbed by the humours of the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the sun's obscure rays is also true of calorific rays\r\nemanating from any obscure source,--from our own bodies, for example, or\r\nfrom the surface of a vessel containing boiling water. We must, in fact,\r\nfigure a warm body also as having its particles in a state of vibration.\r\nWhen these motions are communicated from particle to particle of the\r\nbody the heat is said to be _conducted_; when, on the contrary, the\r\nparticles transmit their vibrations through the surrounding ether, the\r\nheat is said to be _radiant_. This radiant heat, though obscure,\r\nexhibits a deportment exactly similar to light. It may be refracted and\r\nreflected, and collected in the focus of a mirror or of a suitable lens.\r\nThe principle of interference also applies to it, so that by adding heat\r\nto heat we can produce _cold_. The identity indeed is complete\r\nthroughout, and, recurring to the analogy of sound, we might define\r\nthis radiant heat to be light of too low a pitch to be visible.\r\n\r\nI have thus far spoken of _obscure_ heat only; but the selfsame ray may\r\nexcite both light and heat. The red rays of the spectrum possess a very\r\nhigh heating power. It was once supposed that the heat of the spectrum\r\nwas an essence totally distinct from its light; but a profounder\r\nknowledge dispels this supposition, and leads us to infer that the\r\nselfsame ray, falling upon the nerves of feeling, excites heat, and\r\nfalling upon the nerves of seeing, excites light. As the same electric\r\ncurrent, if sent round a magnetic needle, along a wire, and across a\r\nconducting liquid, produces different physical effects, so also the same\r\nagent acting upon different organs of the body affects our consciousness\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Melloni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEAT A KIND OF MOTION.]\r\n\r\nHeat has been defined in the foregoing section as a motion of the\r\nmolecules or atoms of a body; but though the evidence in favour of this\r\nview is at present overwhelming, I do not ask the reader to accept it as\r\na certainty, if he feels sceptically disposed. In this case, I would\r\nonly ask him to accept it as a symbol. Regarded as a mere physical\r\nimage, a kind of paper-currency of the mind, convertible, in due time,\r\ninto the gold of truth, the hypothesis will be found exceedingly useful.\r\n\r\nAll known bodies possess more or less of this molecular motion, and all\r\nbodies are communicating it to the ether in which they are immersed. Ice\r\npossesses it. Ice before it melts attains a temperature of 32 deg. Fahr.,\r\nbut the substance in winter often possesses a temperature far below 32 deg.,\r\nso that in rising to 32 deg. it is _warmed_. In experimenting with ice I\r\nhave often had occasion to cool it to 100 deg. and more below the freezing\r\npoint, and to warm it afterwards up to 32 deg.\r\n\r\nIf then we stand before a wall of ice, the wall radiates heat to us, and\r\nwe also radiate heat to it; but the quantity which we radiate being\r\ngreater than that which the ice radiates, we lose more than we gain, and\r\nare consequently chilled. If, on the contrary, we stand before a warm\r\nstove, a system of exchanges also takes place; but here the quantity we\r\nreceive is in excess of the quantity lost, and we are warmed by the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the earth radiates heat by day and by night into space,\r\nand against the sun, moon, and stars. By day, however, the quantity\r\nreceived is greater than the quantity lost, and the earth is warmed; by\r\nnight the conditions are reversed; the earth radiates more heat than is\r\nsent to her by the moon and stars, and she is consequently cooled.\r\n\r\nBut here an important point is to be noted:--the earth receives the heat\r\nof the sun, moon, and stars, in great part as _luminous_ heat, but she\r\ngives it out as _obscure_ heat. I do not now speak of the heat reflected\r\nby the earth into space, as the light of the moon is to us; but of the\r\nheat which, after it has been absorbed by the earth, and has contributed\r\nto warm it, is radiated into space, as if the earth itself were its\r\nindependent source. Thus we may properly say that the heat radiated from\r\nthe earth is _different in quality_ from that which the earth has\r\nreceived from the sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUALITIES OF HEAT.]\r\n\r\nIn one particular especially does this difference of quality show\r\nitself; besides being non-luminous, the heat radiated from the earth is\r\nmore easily intercepted and absorbed by almost all transparent\r\nsubstances. A vast portion of the sun's rays, for example, can pass\r\ninstantaneously through a thick sheet of water; gunpowder could easily\r\nbe fired by the heat of the sun's rays converged by passing through a\r\nthick water lens; the drops upon leaves in greenhouses often act as\r\nlenses, and cause the sun to burn the leaves upon which they rest. But\r\nwith regard to the rays of heat emanating from an obscure source, they\r\nare all absorbed by a layer of water less than the 20th of an inch in\r\nthickness: water is opaque to such rays, and cuts them off almost as\r\neffectually as a metallic screen. The same is true of other liquids, and\r\nalso of many transparent solids.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE A RATCHET.]\r\n\r\nAssuming the same to be true of gaseous bodies, that they also intercept\r\nthe obscure rays much more readily than the luminous ones, it would\r\nfollow that while the sun's rays penetrate our atmosphere with freedom,\r\nthe change which they undergo in warming the earth deprives them in a\r\nmeasure of this penetrating power. They can reach the earth, but _they\r\ncannot get back_; thus the atmosphere acts the part of a ratchet-wheel\r\nin mechanics; it allows of motion in one direction, but prevents it in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nDe Saussure, Fourier, M. Pouillet, and Mr. Hopkins have developed this\r\nspeculation, and drawn from it consequences of the utmost importance;\r\nbut it nevertheless rested upon a basis of conjecture. Indeed some of\r\nthe eminent men above-named deemed its truth beyond the possibility of\r\nexperimental verification. Melloni showed that for a distance of 18 or\r\n20 feet the absorption of obscure rays by the atmosphere was absolutely\r\ninappreciable. Hence, the _total_ absorption being so small as to elude\r\neven Melloni's delicate tests, it was reasonable to infer that\r\n_differences_ of absorption, if such existed at all, must be far beyond\r\nthe reach of the finest means which we could apply to detect them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFERENCES OF ABSORPTION BY GASES.]\r\n\r\nThis exclusion of one of the three states of material aggregation from\r\nthe region of experiment was, however, by no means satisfactory; for our\r\nright to infer, from the deportment of a solid or a liquid towards\r\nradiant heat, the deportment of a gas, is by no means evident. In both\r\nliquids and solids we have the molecules closely packed, and more or\r\nless chained by the force of cohesion; in gases, on the contrary, they\r\nare perfectly free, and widely separated. How do we know that the\r\ninterception of radiant heat by liquids and solids may not be due to an\r\narrangement and comparative rigidity of their parts, which gases do not\r\nat all share? The assumption which took no note of such a possibility\r\nseemed very insecure, and called for verification.\r\n\r\nMy interest in this question was augmented by the fact, that the\r\nassumption referred to lies, as will be seen, at the root of the glacier\r\nquestion. I therefore endeavoured to fill the gap, and to do for gases\r\nand vapours what had been already so ably done for liquids and solids by\r\nMelloni. I tried the methods heretofore pursued, and found them\r\nunavailing; oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and atmospheric air, examined by\r\nsuch methods, showed no action upon radiant heat. Nature was dumb, but\r\nthe question occurred, \"Had she been addressed in the proper language?\"\r\nIf the experimentalist is convinced of this, he will rest content even\r\nwith a negative; but the absence of this conviction is always a source\r\nof discomfort, and a stimulus to try again.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the method finally applied is all that can here be\r\nreferred to; and it, I hope, will be quite intelligible. Two beams of\r\nheat, from two distinct sources, were allowed to fall upon the same\r\ninstrument,[A] and to contend there for mastery. When both beams were\r\nperfectly equal, they completely neutralized each other's action; but\r\nwhen one of them was in any sensible degree stronger than the other, the\r\npredominance of the former was shown by the instrument. It was so\r\narranged that one of the conflicting beams passed through a tube which\r\ncould be exhausted of air, or filled with any gas; thus varying at\r\npleasure the medium through which it passed. The question then was,\r\nsupposing the two beams to be equal when the tube was filled with air,\r\nwill the exhausting of the tube disturb the equality? The answer was\r\naffirmative; the instrument at once showed that a greater quantity of\r\nheat passed through the vacuum than through the air.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was so arranged that the effect thus produced was very\r\nlarge as measured by the indications of the instrument. But the action\r\nof the simple gases, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, was incomparably\r\nless than that produced by some of the compound gases, while these\r\nlatter again differed widely from each other. Vapours exhibited\r\ndifferences of equal magnitude. The experiments indeed proved that\r\ngaseous bodies varied among themselves, as to their power of\r\ntransmitting radiant heat, just as much as liquids and solids. It was in\r\nthe highest degree interesting to observe how a gas or vapour of perfect\r\ntransparency, as regards light, acted like an opaque screen upon the\r\nheat. To the eye, the gas within the tube might be as invisible as the\r\nair itself, while to the radiant heat it behaved like a cloud which it\r\nwas almost impossible to penetrate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SELECTED HEAT.]\r\n\r\nApplying the same method, I have found that from the sun, from the\r\nelectric light, or from the lime-light, a large amount of heat can be\r\nselected, which is unaffected not only by air, but by the most energetic\r\ngases that experiment has revealed to me; while this same heat, when it\r\nhas its _quality_ changed by being rendered obscure, is powerfully\r\nintercepted. Thus the bold and beautiful speculation above referred to\r\nhas been made an experimental fact; the radiant heat of the sun does\r\ncertainly pass through the atmosphere to the earth with greater\r\nfacility than the radiant heat of the earth can escape into space.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POSSIBLE HEAT OF NEPTUNE.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, were the earth unfurnished with this atmospheric\r\nswathing, its conditions of temperature would be such as to render it\r\nuninhabitable by man; and it is also probable that a suitable atmosphere\r\nenveloping the most distant planet might render it, as regards\r\ntemperature, perfectly habitable. If the planet Neptune, for example, be\r\nsurrounded by an atmosphere which permits the solar and stellar rays to\r\npass towards the planet, but cuts off the escape of the warmth which\r\nthey excite, it is easy to see that such an accumulation of heat may at\r\nlength take place as to render the planet a comfortable habitation for\r\nbeings constituted like ourselves.[B]\r\n\r\nBut let us not wander too far from our own concerns. Where radiant heat\r\nis allowed to fall upon an absorbing substance, a certain thickness of\r\nthe latter is always necessary for the absorption. Supposing we place a\r\nthin film of glass before a source of heat, a certain percentage of the\r\nheat will pass through the glass, and the remainder will be absorbed.\r\nLet the transmitted portion fall upon a second film similar to the\r\nfirst, a smaller percentage than before will be absorbed. A third plate\r\nwould absorb still less, a fourth still less; and, after having passed\r\nthrough a sufficient number of layers, the heat would be so _sifted_\r\nthat all the rays capable of being absorbed by glass would be abstracted\r\nfrom it. Suppose all these films to be placed together so as to form a\r\nsingle thick plate of glass, it is evident that the plate must act upon\r\nthe heat which falls upon it, in such a manner that the major portion is\r\nabsorbed _near the surface at which the heat enters_. This has been\r\ncompletely verified by experiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COLD OF UPPER ATMOSPHERE.]\r\n\r\nApplying this to the heat radiated from the earth, it is manifest that\r\nthe greatest quantity of this heat will be absorbed by the lowest\r\natmospheric strata. And here we find ourselves brought, by\r\nconsiderations apparently remote, face to face with the fact upon which\r\nthe existence of all glaciers depends, namely, the comparative coldness\r\nof the upper regions of the atmosphere. The sun's rays can pass in a\r\ngreat measure through these regions without heating them; and the\r\nearth's rays, which they might absorb, hardly reach them at all, but are\r\nintercepted by the lower portions of the atmosphere.[C]\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the greater coldness of the higher atmosphere is the\r\nexpansion of the denser air of the lower strata when it ascends. The\r\ndense air makes room for itself by pushing back the lighter and less\r\nelastic air which surrounds it: _it does work_, and, to perform this\r\nwork, a certain amount of heat must be consumed. It is the consumption\r\nof this heat--its absolute annihilation as heat--that chills the\r\nexpanded air, and to this action a share of the coldness of the higher\r\natmosphere must undoubtedly be ascribed. A third cause of the difference\r\nof temperature is the large amount of heat communicated, _by way of\r\ncontact_, to the air of the earth's surface; and a fourth and final\r\ncause is the loss endured by the highest strata through radiation into\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The opposite faces of a thermo-electric pile.\r\n\r\n[B] See a most interesting paper on this subject by Mr. Hopkins in the\r\nCambridge 'Transactions,' May, 1856.\r\n\r\n[C] See M. Pouillet's important Memoir on Solar Radiation. Taylor's\r\nScientific Memoirs, vol. iv. p. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF GLACIERS.\r\n\r\n(4.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SNOW-LINE.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus accounted for the greater cold of the higher atmospheric\r\nregions, its consequences are next to be considered. One of these is,\r\nthat clouds formed in the lower portions of the atmosphere, in warm and\r\ntemperate latitudes, usually discharge themselves upon the earth as\r\nrain; while those formed in the higher regions discharge themselves upon\r\nthe mountains as snow. The snow of the higher atmosphere is often melted\r\nto rain in passing through the warmer lower strata: nothing indeed is\r\nmore common than to pass, in descending a mountain, from snow to rain;\r\nand I have already referred to a case of this kind. The appearance of\r\nthe grassy and pine-clad alps, as seen from the valleys after a wet\r\nnight, is often strikingly beautiful; the level at which the snow turned\r\nto rain being distinctly marked upon the slopes. Above this level the\r\nmountains are white, while below it they are green. The eye follows this\r\n_snow-line_ with ease along the mountains, and when a sufficient extent\r\nof country is commanded its regularity is surprising.\r\n\r\nThe term \"snow-line,\" however, which has been here applied to a local\r\nand temporary phenomenon, is commonly understood to mean something else.\r\nIn the case just referred to it marked the place where the supply of\r\nsolid matter from the upper atmospheric regions, during a single fall,\r\nwas exactly equal to its consumption; but the term is usually understood\r\nto mean the line along which the quantity of snow which falls _annually_\r\nis melted, and no more. Below this line each year's snow is completely\r\ncleared away by the summer heat; above it a residual layer abides,\r\nwhich gradually augments in thickness from the snow-line upwards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOUNTAINS UNLOADED BY GLACIERS.]\r\n\r\nHere then we have a fresh layer laid on every year; and it is evident\r\nthat, if this process continued without interruption, every mountain\r\nwhich rises above the snow-line must augment annually in height; the\r\nwaters of the sea thus piled, in a solid form, upon the summits of the\r\nhills, would raise the latter to an indefinite elevation. But, as might\r\nbe expected, the snow upon steep mountain-sides frequently slips and\r\nrolls down in avalanches into warmer regions, where it is reduced to\r\nwater. A comparatively small quantity of the snow is, however, thus got\r\nrid of, and the great agent which Nature employs to relieve her\r\noverladen mountains is the glaciers.\r\n\r\nLet us here avoid an error which may readily arise out of the foregoing\r\nreflections. The principal region of clouds and rain and snow extends\r\nonly to a limited distance upwards in the atmosphere; the highest\r\nregions contain very little moisture, and were our mountains\r\nsufficiently lofty to penetrate those regions, the quantity of snow\r\nfalling upon their summits would be too trifling to resist the direct\r\naction of the solar rays. These would annually clear the summits to a\r\ncertain level, and hence, were our mountains high enough, we should have\r\na superior, as well as an inferior, snow-line; the region of perpetual\r\nsnow would form a belt, below which, in summer, snowless valleys and\r\nplains would extend, and above which snowless summits would rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WHITE AND BLUE ICE.]\r\n\r\nAt its origin then a glacier is snow--at its lower extremity it is ice.\r\nThe blue blocks that arch the source of the Arveiron were once powdery\r\nsnow upon the slopes of the Col du Geant. Could our vision penetrate\r\ninto the body of the glacier, we should find that the change from white\r\nto blue essentially consists in the gradual expulsion of the air which\r\nwas originally entangled in the meshes of the fallen snow. Whiteness\r\nalways results from the intimate and irregular mixture of air and a\r\ntransparent solid; a crushed diamond would resemble snow; if we pound\r\nthe most transparent rock-salt into powder we have a substance as white\r\nas the whitest culinary salt; and the colourless glass vessel which\r\nholds the salt would also, if pounded, give a powder as white as the\r\nsalt itself. It is a law of light that in passing from one substance to\r\nanother possessing a different power of refraction, a portion of it is\r\nalways reflected. Hence when light falls upon a transparent solid mixed\r\nwith air, at each passage of the light from the air to the solid and\r\nfrom the solid to the air a portion of it is reflected; and, in the case\r\nof a powder, this reflection occurs so frequently that the passage of\r\nthe light is practically cut off. Thus, from the mixture of two\r\nperfectly transparent substances, we obtain an opaque one; from the\r\nintimate mixture of air and water we obtain foam; clouds owe their\r\nopacity to the same principle; and the condensed steam of a locomotive\r\ncasts a shadow upon the fields adjacent to the line, because the\r\nsunlight is wasted in echoes at the innumerable limiting surfaces of\r\nwater and air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AIR-BUBBLES IN ICE.]\r\n\r\nThe snow which falls upon high mountain-eminences has often a\r\ntemperature far below the freezing point of water. Such snow is _dry_,\r\nand if it always continued so the formation of a glacier from it would\r\nbe impossible. The first action of the summer's sun is to raise the\r\ntemperature of the superficial snow to 32 deg., and afterwards to melt it.\r\nThe water thus formed percolates through the colder mass underneath, and\r\nthis I take to be the first active agency in expelling the air\r\nentangled in the snow. But as the liquid trickles over the surfaces of\r\ngranules colder than itself it is partially deposited in a solid form on\r\nthese surfaces, thus augmenting the size of the granules, and cementing\r\nthem together. When the mass thus formed is examined, the air within it\r\nis found as _round bubbles_. Now it is manifest that the air caught in\r\nthe irregular interstices of the snow can have no tendency to assume\r\nthis form so long as the snow remains solid; but the process to which I\r\nhave referred--the saturation of the lower portions of the snow by the\r\nwater produced by the melting of the superficial portions--enables the\r\nair to form itself into globules, and to give the ice of the _neve_ its\r\npeculiar character. Thus we see that, though the sun cannot get directly\r\nat the deeper portions of the snow, by liquefying the upper layer he\r\ncharges it with heat, and makes it his messenger to the cold subjacent\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nThe frost of the succeeding winter may, I think, or may not, according\r\nto circumstances, penetrate through this layer, and solidify the water\r\nwhich it still retains in its interstices. If the winter set in with\r\nclear frosty weather, the penetration will probably take place; but if\r\nheavy snow occur at the commencement of winter, thus throwing a\r\nprotective covering over the _neve_, freezing to any great depth may be\r\nprevented. Mr. Huxley's idea seems to be quite within the range of\r\npossibility, that water-cells may be transmitted from the origin of the\r\nglacier to its end, retaining their contents always liquid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SNOW PRESSED TO ICE.]\r\n\r\nIt was formerly supposed, and is perhaps still supposed by many, that\r\nthe snow of the mountains is converted into the ice of the glacier by\r\nthe process of saturation and freezing just indicated. But the frozen\r\nlayer would not yet resemble glacier ice; it is only at the deeper\r\nportions of the _neve_ that we find an approximation to the true ice of\r\nthe glacier. This brings us to the second great agent in the process of\r\nglacification, namely, pressure. The ice of the _neve_ at 32 deg. may be\r\nsqueezed or crushed with extreme facility; and if the force be applied\r\nslowly and with caution, the yielding of the mass may be made to\r\nresemble the yielding of a plastic body. In the depths of the _neve_,\r\nwhere each portion of the ice is surrounded by a resistant mass, rude\r\ncrushing is of course out of the question. The layers underneath yield\r\nwith extreme slowness to the pressure of the mass above them; they are\r\nsqueezed, but not rudely fractured; and even should rude fracture occur,\r\nthe ice, as shall subsequently be shown, possesses the power of\r\nrestoring its own continuity. Thus, then, the lower portions of the\r\n_neve_ are removed by pressure more and more from the condition of snow,\r\nthe air-bubbles which give to the _neve_-ice its whiteness are more and\r\nmore expelled, and this process, continued throughout the entire\r\nglacier, finally brings the ice to that state of magnificent\r\ntransparency which we find at the termination of the glacier of\r\nRosenlaui and elsewhere. This is all capable of experimental proof. The\r\nMessrs. Schlagintweit compressed the snow of the _neve_ to compact ice;\r\nand I have myself frequently obtained slabs of ice from snow in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOUR OF WATER AND ICE.\r\n\r\n(6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun is continually sending forth waves of different lengths, all of\r\nwhich travel with the same velocity through the ether. When these waves\r\nenter a prism of glass they are retarded, but in different degrees. The\r\nshorter waves suffer the greatest retardation, and in consequence of\r\nthis are most deflected from their straight course. It is this property\r\nwhich enables us to separate one from the other in the solar spectrum,\r\nand this separation proves that the waves are by no means inextricably\r\nentangled with each other, but that they travel independently through\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this independence, the same body may intercept one\r\nsystem of waves while it allows another to pass: on this quality,\r\nindeed, depend all the phenomena of colour. A red glass, for example, is\r\nred because it is so constituted that it destroys the shorter waves\r\nwhich produce the other colours, and transmits only the waves which\r\nproduce red. I may remark, however, that scarcely any glass is of a pure\r\ncolour; along with the predominant waves, some of the other waves are\r\npermitted to pass. The colours of flowers are also very impure; in fact,\r\nto get pure colours we must resort to a delicate prismatic analysis of\r\nwhite light.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONG WAVES MOST ABSORBED.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that a layer of water less than the twentieth\r\nof an inch in thickness suffices to stop and destroy all waves of\r\nradiant heat emanating from an obscure source. The longer waves of the\r\nobscure heat cannot get through water, and I find that all transparent\r\ncompounds which contain _hydrogen_ are peculiarly hostile to the longer\r\nundulations. It is, I think, the presence of this element in the\r\nhumours of the eye which prevents the extra red rays of the solar\r\nspectrum from reaching the retina. It is interesting to observe that\r\nwhile bisulphide of carbon, chloride of phosphorus, and other liquids\r\nwhich contain no hydrogen, permit a large portion of the rays emanating\r\nfrom an iron or copper ball, at a heat below redness, to pass through\r\nthem with facility, the same thickness of substances equally\r\ntransparent, but which contain hydrogen, such as ether, alcohol, water,\r\nor the vitreous humour of the eye of an ox, completely intercepts these\r\nobscure rays. The same is true of solid bodies; a very slight thickness\r\nof those which contain hydrogen offers an impassable barrier to all rays\r\nemanating from a non-luminous source.[A] But the heat thus intercepted\r\nis by no means lost; its _radiant form_ merely is destroyed. Its waves\r\nare shivered upon the particles of the body, but they impart warmth to\r\nit, while the heat which retains its radiant form contributes in no way\r\nto the warmth of the body through which it passes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FINAL COLOUR OF ICE AND WATER BLUE.]\r\n\r\nWater then absorbs all the extra red rays of the sun, and if the layer\r\nbe thick enough it invades the red rays themselves. Thus the greater the\r\ndistance the solar beams travel through pure water the more are they\r\ndeprived of those components which lie at the red end of the spectrum.\r\nThe consequence is, that the light finally transmitted by the water, and\r\nwhich gives to it its colour, is _blue_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXPERIMENT.]\r\n\r\nI find the following mode of examining the colour of water both\r\nsatisfactory and convenient:--A tin tube, fifteen feet long and three\r\ninches in diameter, has its two ends stopped securely by pieces of\r\ncolourless plate glass. It is placed in a horizontal position, and pure\r\nwater is poured into it through a small lateral pipe, until the liquid\r\nreaches half way up the glasses at the ends; the tube then holds a\r\nsemi-cylinder of water and a semi-cylinder of air. A white plate, or a\r\nsheet of white paper, well illuminated, is then placed at a little\r\ndistance from one end of the tube, and is looked at through the tube.\r\nTwo semicircular spaces are then seen, one by the light which has passed\r\nthrough the air, the other by the light which has passed through the\r\nwater; and their proximity furnishes a means of comparison, which is\r\nabsolutely necessary in experiments of this kind. It is always found\r\nthat, while the former semicircle remains white, the latter one is\r\nvividly coloured.[B]\r\n\r\nWhen the beam from an electric lamp is sent through this tube, and a\r\nconvex lens is placed at a suitable distance from its most distant end,\r\na magnified image of the coloured and uncoloured semicircles may be\r\nprojected upon a screen. Tested thus, I have sometimes found, after\r\nrain, the ordinary pipe-water of the Royal Institution quite opaque;\r\nwhile, under other circumstances, I have found the water of a clear\r\ngreen. The pump-water of the Institution thus examined exhibits a rich\r\nsherry colour, while distilled water is blue-green.\r\n\r\nThe blueness of the Grotto of Capri is due to the fact that the light\r\nwhich enters it has previously traversed a great depth of clear water.\r\nAccording to Bunsen's account, the _laugs_, or cisterns of hot water, in\r\nIceland must be extremely beautiful. The water contains silica in\r\nsolution, which, as the walls of the cistern arose, was deposited upon\r\nthem in fantastic incrustations. These, though white, when looked at\r\nthrough the water appear of a lovely blue, which deepens in tint as the\r\nvision plunges deeper into the liquid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ICE OPAQUE TO RADIANT HEAT.]\r\n\r\nIce is a crystal formed from this blue liquid, the colour of which it\r\nretains. Ice is the most opaque of transparent solids to radiant heat,\r\nas water is the most opaque of liquids. According to Melloni, a plate of\r\nice one twenty-fifth of an inch thick, which permits the rays of light\r\nto pass without sensible absorption, cuts off 94 per cent. of the rays\r\nof heat issuing from a powerful oil lamp, 99-1/2 per cent. of the rays\r\nissuing from incandescent platinum, and the whole of the rays issuing\r\nfrom an obscure source. The above numbers indicate how large a portion\r\nof the rays emitted by our artificial sources of light is obscure.\r\n\r\nWhen the rays of light pass through a sufficient thickness of ice the\r\nlonger waves are, as in the case of water, more and more absorbed, and\r\nthe final colour of the substance is therefore blue. But when the ice is\r\nfilled with minute air-bubbles, though we should loosely call it\r\n_white_, it may exhibit, even in small pieces, a delicate blue tint.\r\nThis, I think, is due to the frequent interior reflection which takes\r\nplace at the surfaces of the air-cells; so that the light which reaches\r\nthe eye from the interior may, in consequence of its having been\r\nreflected hither and thither, really have passed through a considerable\r\nthickness of ice. The same remark, as we have already seen, applies to\r\nthe delicate colour of newly fallen snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] What is here stated regarding hydrogen is true of all the liquids\r\nand solids which have hitherto been examined,--but whether any\r\nexceptions occur, future experience must determine. It is only when in\r\ncombination that it exhibits this impermeability to the obscure rays.\r\n\r\n[B] In my own experiments I have never yet been able to obtain a pure\r\nblue, the nearest approach to it being a blue-green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOURS OF THE SKY.\r\n\r\n(7.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEWTON'S HYPOTHESIS.]\r\n\r\nIn treating of the Colours of Thin Plates we found that a certain\r\nthickness was necessary to produce blue, while a greater thickness was\r\nnecessary for red. With that wonderful power of generalization which\r\nbelonged to him, Newton thus applies this apparently remote fact to the\r\nblue of the sky:--\"The blue of the first order, though very faint and\r\nlittle, may possibly be the colour of some substances, and particularly\r\nthe azure colour of the skies seems to be of this order. For all\r\nvapours, when they begin to condense and coalesce into small parcels,\r\nbecome first of that bigness whereby such an azure is reflected, before\r\nthey can constitute clouds of other colours. And so, this being the\r\nfirst colour which vapours begin to reflect, it ought to be the colour\r\nof the finest and most transparent skies, in which vapours are not\r\narrived at that grossness requisite to reflect other colours, as we find\r\nit is by experience.\"\r\n\r\nM. Clausius has written a most interesting paper, which he endeavours to\r\nshow that the minute particles of water which are supposed by Newton to\r\nreflect the light, cannot be little globes entirely composed of water,\r\nbut bladders or hollow spheres; the vapour must be in what is generally\r\ntermed the _vesicular_ state. He was followed by M. Bruecke, whose\r\nexperiments prove that the suspended particles may be so small that the\r\nreasoning of M. Clausius may not apply to them.\r\n\r\nBut why need we assume the existence of such particles at all?--why not\r\nassume that the colour of the air is blue, and renders the light of the\r\nsun blue, after the fashion of a blue glass or a solution of the\r\nsulphate of copper? I have already referred to the great variation which\r\nthe colour of the firmament undergoes in the Alps, and have remarked\r\nthat this seems to indicate that the blue depends upon some variable\r\nconstituent of the atmosphere. Further, we find that the blue light of\r\nthe sky is _reflected_ light; and there must be something in the\r\natmosphere capable of producing this reflection; but this thing,\r\nwhatever it is, produces another effect which the blue glass or liquid\r\nis unable to produce. These _transmit_ blue light, whereas, when the\r\nsolar beams have traversed a great length of air, as in the morning or\r\nthe evening, they are yellow, or orange, or even blood-red, according to\r\nthe state of the atmosphere:--the transmitted light and the reflected\r\nlight of the atmosphere are then totally different in colour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GOETHE'S HYPOTHESIS.]\r\n\r\nGoethe, in his celebrated 'Farbenlehre,' gives a theory of the colour of\r\nthe sky, and has illustrated it by a series of striking facts. He\r\nassumed two principles in the universe--Light and Darkness--and an\r\nintermediate stage of Turbidity. When the darkness is seen through a\r\nturbid medium on which the light falls, the medium appears blue; when\r\nthe light itself is viewed through such a medium, it is yellow, or\r\norange, or ruby-red. This he applies to the atmosphere, which sends us\r\nblue light, or red, according as the darkness of infinite space, or the\r\nbright surface of the sun, is regarded through it.\r\n\r\nAs a theory of colours Goethe's work is of no value, but the facts which\r\nhe has brought forward in illustration of the action of turbid media are\r\nin the highest degree interesting. He refers to the blueness of distant\r\nmountains, of smoke, of the lower part of the flame of a candle (which\r\nif looked at with a white surface behind it completely disappears), of\r\nsoapy water, and of the precipitates of various resins in water. One of\r\nhis anecdotes in connexion with this subject is extremely curious and\r\ninstructive. The portrait of a very dignified theologian having suffered\r\nfrom dirt, it was given to a painter to be cleaned. The clergyman was\r\ndrawn in a dress of black velvet, over which the painter, in the first\r\nplace, passed his sponge. To his astonishment the black velvet changed\r\nto the colour of blue plush, and completely altered the aspect of its\r\nwearer. Goethe was informed of the fact; the experiment was repeated in\r\nhis presence, and he at once solved it by reference to his theory. The\r\nvarnish of the picture when mixed with the water formed a turbid medium,\r\nand the black coat seen through it appeared blue; when the water\r\nevaporated the coat resumed its original aspect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUSPENDED PARTICLES.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the real explanation of these effects, it may be shown,\r\nthat, if a beam of white light be sent through a liquid which contains\r\nextremely minute particles in a state of suspension, the short waves are\r\nmore copiously reflected by such particles than the long ones; blue, for\r\nexample, is more copiously reflected than red. This may be shown by\r\nvarious fine precipitates, but the best is that of Bruecke. We know that\r\nmastic and various resins are soluble in alcohol, and are precipitated\r\nwhen the solution is poured into water: _Eau de Cologne_, for example,\r\nproduces a white precipitate when poured into water. If however this\r\nprecipitate be sufficiently diluted, it gives the liquid a bluish colour\r\nby reflected light. Even when the precipitate is very thick and gross,\r\nand floats upon the liquid like a kind of curd, its under portions often\r\nexhibit a fine blue. To obtain particles of a proper size, Bruecke\r\nrecommends 1 gramme of colourless mastic to be dissolved in 87 grammes\r\nof alcohol, and dropped into a beaker of water, which is kept in a state\r\nof agitation. In this way a blue resembling that of the firmament may be\r\nproduced. It is best seen when a black cloth is placed behind the glass;\r\nbut in certain positions this blue liquid appears yellow; and these are\r\nthe positions when the _transmitted_ light reaches the eye. It is\r\nevident that this change of colour must necessarily exist; for the blue\r\nbeing partially withdrawn by more copious reflection, the transmitted\r\nlight must partake more or less of the character of the complementary\r\ncolour; though it does not follow that they should be exactly\r\ncomplementary to each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SUN THROUGH LONDON SMOKE.]\r\n\r\nWhen a long tube is filled with clear water, the colour of the liquid,\r\nas before stated, shows itself by transmitted light. The effect is very\r\ninteresting when a solution of mastic is permitted to drop into such a\r\ntube, and the fine precipitate to diffuse itself in the water. The\r\nblue-green of the liquid is first neutralized, and a yellow colour shows\r\nitself; on adding more of the solution the colour passes from yellow to\r\norange, and from orange to blood-red. With a cell an inch and a half in\r\nwidth, containing water, into which the solution of mastic is suffered\r\nto drop, the same effect may be obtained. If the light of an electric\r\nlamp be caused to form a clear sunlike disk upon a white screen, the\r\ngradual change of this light by augmented precipitation into deep\r\nglowing red, resembling the colour of the sun when seen through fine\r\nLondon smoke, is exceedingly striking. Indeed the smoke acts, in some\r\nmeasure, the part of our finely-suspended matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORNING AND EVENING RED.]\r\n\r\nBy such means it is possible to imitate the phenomena of the firmament;\r\nwe can produce its pure blue, and cause it to vary as in nature. The\r\nmilkiness which steals over the heavens, and enables us to distinguish\r\none cloudless day from another, can be produced with the greatest ease.\r\nThe yellow, orange, and red light of the morning and evening can also be\r\nobtained: indeed the effects are so strikingly alike as to suggest a\r\ncommon origin--that the colours of the sky are due to minute particles\r\ndiffused through the atmosphere. These particles are doubtless the\r\ncondensed vapour of water, and its variation in quality and amount\r\nenables us to understand the variability of the firmamental blue, and of\r\nthe morning and the evening red. Professor Forbes, moreover, has made\r\nthe interesting observation that the steam of a locomotive, at a certain\r\nstage of its condensation, is blue or red according as it is viewed by\r\nreflected or transmitted light.\r\n\r\nThese considerations enable us to account for a number of facts of\r\ncommon occurrence. Thin milk, when poured upon a black surface, appears\r\nbluish. The milk is colourless; that is, its blueness is not due to\r\n_absorption_, but to a _separation_ of the light by the particles\r\nsuspended in the liquid. The juices of various plants owe their blueness\r\nto the same cause; but perhaps the most curious illustration is that\r\npresented by a blue eye. Here we have no true colouring matter, no\r\nproper absorption; but we look through a muddy medium at the black\r\nchoroid coat within the eye, and the medium appears blue.[A]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COLOUR OF SWISS LAKES.]\r\n\r\nIs it not probable that this action of finely-divided matter may have\r\nsome influence on the colour of some of the Swiss lakes--as that of\r\nGeneva for example? This lake is simply an expansion of the river Rhone,\r\nwhich rushes from the end of the Rhone glacier, as the Arveiron does\r\nfrom the end of the Mer de Glace. Numerous other streams join the Rhone\r\nright and left during its downward course; and these feeders, being\r\nalmost wholly derived from glaciers, join the Rhone charged with the\r\nfiner matter which these in their motion have ground from the rocks over\r\nwhich they have passed. But the glaciers must grind the mass beneath\r\nthem to particles of all sizes, and I cannot help thinking that the\r\nfinest of them must remain suspended in the lake throughout its entire\r\nlength. Faraday has shown that a precipitate of gold may require months\r\nto sink to the bottom of a bottle not more than five inches high, and\r\nin all probability it would require _ages_ of calm subsidence to bring\r\n_all_ the particles which the Lake of Geneva contains to its bottom. It\r\nseems certainly worthy of examination whether such particles suspended\r\nin the water contribute to the production of that magnificent blue which\r\nhas excited the admiration of all who have seen it under favourable\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Helmholtz, 'Das Sehen des Menschen.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORAINES.\r\n\r\n(8.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surface of the glacier does not long retain the shining whiteness of\r\nthe snow from which it is derived. It is flanked by mountains which are\r\nwashed by rain, dislocated by frost, riven by lightning, traversed by\r\navalanches, and swept by storms. The lighter debris is scattered by the\r\nwinds far and wide over the glacier, sullying the purity of its surface.\r\nLoose shingle rattles at intervals down the sides of the mountains, and\r\nfalls upon the ice where it touches the rocks. Large rocks are\r\ncontinually let loose, which come jumping from ledge to ledge, the\r\ncohesion of some being proof against the shocks which they experience;\r\nwhile others, when they hit the rocks, burst like bomb-shells, and\r\nshower their fragments upon the ice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LATERAL MORAINES.]\r\n\r\nThus the glacier is incessantly loaded along its borders with the ruins\r\nof the mountains which limit it; and it is evident that the quantity of\r\nrock and rubbish thus cast upon the glacier depends upon the character\r\nof the adjacent mountains. Where the summits are bare and friable, we\r\nmay expect copious showers; where they are resistant, and particularly\r\nwhere they are protected by a covering of ice and snow, the quantity\r\nwill be small. As the glacier moves downward, it carries with it the\r\nload deposited upon it. Long ridges of debris thus flank the glacier,\r\nand these ridges are called _lateral moraines_. Where two tributary\r\nglaciers join to form a trunk-glacier, their adjacent lateral moraines\r\nare laid side by side at the place of confluence, thus constituting a\r\nridge which runs along the middle of the trunk-glacier, and which is\r\ncalled a _medial moraine_. The rocks and debris carried down by the\r\nglacier are finally deposited at its lower extremity, forming there a\r\n_terminal moraine_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEDIAL AND TERMINAL MORAINES.]\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be stated that the number of medial moraines is only\r\nlimited by the number of branch glaciers. If a glacier have but two\r\nbranches, it will have only one medial moraine; if it have three\r\nbranches, it will have two medial moraines; if _n_ branches, it will\r\nhave _n_-1 medial moraines. The number of medial moraines, in short, is\r\nalways _one less_ than the number of branches. A glance at the annexed\r\nfigure will reveal the manner in which the lateral moraines of the Mer\r\nde Glace unite to form medial ones. (See Fig. 19.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORAINES OF THE MER DE GLACE.\r\nFig. 19. _To face p. 264_.]\r\n\r\nWhen a glacier diminishes in size it leaves its lateral moraines\r\nstranded on the flanks of the valleys. Successive shrinkings may thus\r\noccur, and _have_ occurred at intervals of centuries; and a succession\r\nof old lateral moraines, such as many glacier-valleys exhibit, is the\r\nconsequence. The Mer de Glace, for example, has its old lateral\r\nmoraines, which run parallel with its present ones. The glacier may also\r\ndiminish _in length_ at distant intervals; the result being a succession\r\nof more or less concentric terminal moraines. In front of the\r\nRhone-glacier we have six or seven such moraines, and the Mer de Glace\r\nalso possesses a series of them.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the effect produced by a block of stone upon the\r\nsurface of a glacier. The ice around it receives the direct rays of the\r\nsun, and is acted on by the warm air; it is therefore constantly\r\nmelting. The stone also receives the solar beams, is warmed, and\r\ntransmits its heat, by conduction, to the ice beneath it. If the heat\r\nthus transmitted to the ice through the stone be less than an equal\r\nspace of the surrounding ice receives, it is manifest that the ice\r\naround the stone will waste more quickly than that beneath it, and the\r\nconsequence is, that, as the surface sinks, it leaves behind it a\r\npillar of ice, on which the block is elevated. If the stone be wide and\r\nflat, it may rise to a considerable height, and in this position it\r\nconstitutes what is called a glacier-_table_. (See Fig. 6.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLACIER TABLES ACCOUNTED FOR.]\r\n\r\nAlmost all glaciers present examples of such tables; but no glacier with\r\nwhich I am acquainted exhibits them in greater number and perfection\r\nthan the Unteraar glacier, near the Grimsel. Vast masses of granite are\r\nthus poised aloft on icy pedestals; but a limit is placed to their\r\nexaltation by the following circumstance. The sun plays obliquely upon\r\nthe table all day; its southern extremity receives more heat than its\r\nnorthern, and the consequence is, that it _dips_ towards the south.\r\nStrictly speaking, the plane of the dip rotates a little during the day,\r\nbeing a little inclined towards the east in the morning, north and south\r\na little after noon, and inclined towards the west in the evening; so\r\nthat, theoretically speaking, the block is a sun-dial, showing by its\r\nposition the hour of the day. This rotation is, however, too small to be\r\nsensible, and hence _the dip of the stones upon a glacier sufficiently\r\nexposed to the sunlight, enables us at any time to draw the meridian\r\nline along its surface_. The inclination finally becomes so great that\r\nthe block slips off its pedestal, and begins to form another, while the\r\none which it originally occupied speedily disappears, under the\r\ninfluence of sun and air. Fig. 20 represents a typical section of a\r\nglacier-table, the sun's rays being supposed to fall in the direction of\r\nthe shading lines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPE \"TABLE.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Typical section of a glacier Table.]\r\n\r\nStones of a certain size are always lifted in the way described. A\r\nconsiderable portion of the heat which a large block receives is wasted\r\nby radiation, and by communication to the air, so that the quantity\r\nwhich reaches the ice beneath is trifling. Such a mass is, of course, a\r\nprotector of the ice beneath it. But if the stone be small, and dark in\r\ncolour, it absorbs the heat with avidity, communicates it quickly to\r\nthe ice with which it is in contact, and consequently sinks in the ice.\r\nThis is also the case with bits of dirt and the finer fragments of\r\ndebris; they sink in the glacier. Sometimes, however, a pretty thick\r\nlayer of sand is washed over the ice from the moraines, or from the\r\nmountain-sides; and such sand-layers give birth to ice-cones, which grow\r\nto peculiarly grand dimensions on the Lower Aar glacier. I say \"grow,\"\r\nbut the truth, of course, is, that the surrounding ice wastes, while the\r\nportion underneath the sand is so protected that it remains as an\r\neminence behind. At first sight, these sand-covered cones appear huge\r\nheaps of dirt, but on examination they are found to be cones of ice, and\r\nthat the dirt constitutes merely a superficial covering.\r\n\r\nTurn we now to the moraines. Protecting, as they do, the ice from waste,\r\nthey rise, as might be expected, in vast ridges above the general\r\nsurface of the glacier. In some cases the surrounding mass has been so\r\nwasted as to leave the spines of ice which support the moraines forty or\r\nfifty feet above the general level of the glacier. I should think the\r\nmoraines of the Mer de Glace about the Tacul rise to this height. But\r\nlower down, in the neighbourhood of the Echelets, these high ridges\r\ndisappear, and nought remains to mark the huge moraine but a strip of\r\ndirt, and perhaps a slight longitudinal protuberance on the surface of\r\nthe glacier. How have the blocks vanished that once loaded the moraines\r\nnear the Tacul? They have been swallowed in the crevasses which\r\nintersect the moraines lower down; and if we could examine the ice at\r\nthe Echelets we should find the engulfed rocks in the body of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORAINES ENGULFED AND DISGORGED.]\r\n\r\nCases occur, wherein moraines, after having been engulfed, and hidden\r\nfor a time, are again entirely disgorged by the glacier. Two moraines\r\nrun along the basin of the Talefre, one from the Jardin, the other from\r\nan adjacent promontory, proceeding parallel to each other towards the\r\nsummit of the great ice-fall. Here the ice is riven, and profound chasms\r\nare formed, in which the blocks and shingle of the moraines disappear.\r\nThroughout the entire ice-fall the only trace of the moraines is a broad\r\ndirt-streak, which the eye may follow along the centre of the fall, with\r\nperhaps here and there a stone which has managed to rise from its frozen\r\nsepulchre. But the ice wastes, and at the base of the fall large masses\r\nof stone begin to reappear; these become more numerous as we descend;\r\nthe smaller debris also appears, and finally, at some distance below the\r\nfall, the moraine is completely restored, and begins to exercise its\r\nprotecting influence; it rises upon its ridge of ice, and dominates as\r\nbefore over the surface of the glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRANSPARENCY OF ICE UNDER THE MORAINES.]\r\n\r\nThe ice under the moraines and sand-cones is of a different appearance\r\nfrom that of the surrounding glacier, and the principles we have laid\r\ndown enable us to explain the difference. The sun's rays, striking upon\r\nthe unprotected surface of the glacier, enter the ice to a considerable\r\ndepth; and the consequence is, that the ice near the surface of the\r\nglacier is always disintegrated, being cut up with minute fissures and\r\ncavities, filled with water and air, which, for reasons already\r\nassigned, cause the glacier, when it is clean, to appear white and\r\nopaque. The ice under the moraines, on the contrary, is usually dark and\r\ntransparent; I have sometimes seen it as black as pitch, the blackness\r\nbeing a proof of its great transparency, which prevents the reflection\r\nof light from its interior.\r\n\r\nThe ice under the moraines cannot be assailed in its depths by the solar\r\nheat, because this heat becomes _obscure_ before it reaches the ice, and\r\nas such it lacks the power of penetrating the substance. It is also\r\ncommunicated in great part by way of contact instead of by radiation. A\r\nthin film at the surface of the moraine-ice engages all the heat that\r\nacts upon it, its deeper portions remaining intact and transparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIER MOTION.\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY.\r\n\r\n(9.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEVE AND GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nThough a glacier is really composed of two portions, one above and the\r\nother below the snow-line, the term glacier is usually restricted to the\r\nlatter, while the French term _neve_ is applied to the former. It is\r\nmanifest that the snow which falls upon the glacier proper can\r\ncontribute nothing to its growth or permanence; for every summer is not\r\nonly competent to abolish the accumulations of the foregoing winter, but\r\nto do a great deal more. During each summer indeed a considerable\r\nquantity of the ice below the snow-line is reduced to water; so that, if\r\nthe waste were not in some way supplied, it is manifest that in a few\r\nyears the lower portion of the glacier must entirely disappear. The end\r\nof the Mer de Glace, for example, could never year after year thrust\r\nitself into the valley of Chamouni, were there not some agency by which\r\nits manifest waste is made good. This agency is the motion of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\nTo those unacquainted with the fact of their motion, but who have stood\r\nupon these vast accumulations of ice, and noticed their apparent fixity\r\nand rigidity, the assertion that a glacier moves must appear in the\r\nhighest degree startling and incredible. They would naturally share the\r\ndoubts of a certain professor of Tuebingen, who, after a visit to the\r\nglaciers of Switzerland, went home and wrote a book flatly denying the\r\npossibility of their motion. But reflection comes to the aid of sense,\r\nand qualifies first impressions. We ask ourselves how is the permanence\r\nof the glacier secured? How are the moraines to be accounted for?\r\nWhence come the blocks which we often find at the terminus of a glacier,\r\nand which we know belong to distant mountains? The necessity of motion\r\nto produce these results becomes more and more apparent, until at length\r\nwe resort to actual experiment. We take two fixed points at opposite\r\nsides of the glacier, so that a block of stone which rests upon the ice\r\nmay be in the straight line which unites the points; and we soon find\r\nthat the block quits the line, and is borne downwards by the glacier. We\r\nmay well realize the interest of the man who first engaged in this\r\nexperiment, and the pleasure which he felt on finding that the block\r\nmoved; for even now, after hundreds of observations on the motion of\r\nglaciers have been made, the actual observance of this motion for the\r\nfirst time is always accompanied by a thrill of delight. Such pleasure\r\nthe direct perception of natural truth always imparts. Like Antaeus we\r\ntouch our mother, and are refreshed by the contact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HUGI'S MEASUREMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe fact of glacier-motion has been known for an indefinite time to the\r\ninhabitants of the mountains; but the first who made quantitative\r\nobservations of the motion was Hugi. He found that from 1827 to 1830 his\r\ncabin upon the glacier of the Aar had moved 100 metres, or about 110\r\nyards, downwards; in 1836 it had moved 714 metres; and in 1841 M.\r\nAgassiz found it at a distance of 1,428 metres from its first position.\r\nThis is equivalent in round numbers to an average velocity of 100 metres\r\na year. In 1840 M. Agassiz fixed the position of the rock known as the\r\nHotel des Neufchatelois; and on the 5th of September, 1841, he found\r\nthat it had moved 213 feet downward. Between this date and September,\r\n1842, the rock moved 273 feet, thus accomplishing a distance of 486 feet\r\nin two years.\r\n\r\nBut much uncertainty prevailed regarding the motion of the boulders, for\r\nthey sometimes rolled upon the glacier, and hence it was resolved to\r\nuse stakes of wood driven into the ice. In the month of July, 1841, M.\r\nEscher de la Linth fixed a system of stakes, every two of which were\r\nseparated from each other by a distance of 100 metres, across the great\r\nAletsch glacier. A considerable number of other stakes were fixed\r\n_along_ the glacier, the longitudinal separation being also 100 metres.\r\nOn the 8th of July the stakes stood at a depth of about three feet in\r\nthe ice. On the 16th of August he returned to the glacier. Almost all\r\nthe stakes had fallen, and no trace, even of the holes in which they had\r\nbeen sunk, remained. M. Agassiz was equally unsuccessful on the glacier\r\nof the Aar. It must therefore be borne in mind, that, previous to the\r\nintroduction of the facile modes of measurement which we now employ,\r\nsevere labour and frequent disappointment had taught observers the true\r\nconditions of success.\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat upon the Aletsch, M. Escher joined MM. Agassiz and\r\nDesor on the Aar glacier, where, between the 31st of August and the 5th\r\nof September, they fixed in concert the positions of a series of blocks\r\nupon the ice, with the view of measuring their displacements the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AGASSIZ'S MEASUREMENTS.]\r\n\r\nAnother observation of great importance was also commenced in 1841.\r\nWarned by previous failures, M. Agassiz had iron boring-rods carried up\r\nthe glacier, with which he pierced the ice at six places to a depth of\r\nten feet, and at each place drove a wooden pile into the ice. These six\r\nstations were in the same straight line across the glacier; three of\r\nthem standing upon the Finsteraar and three on the Lauteraar tributary.\r\nAbout this time also M. Agassiz conceived the idea of having the\r\ndisplacements measured the year following with precise instruments, and\r\nalso of having constructed, by a professional engineer, a map of the\r\nentire glacier, on which all its visible \"accidents\" should be drawn\r\naccording to scale. This excellent work was afterwards executed by M.\r\nWild, now Professor of Geodesy and Topography in the Polytechnic School\r\nof Zuerich, and it is published as a separate atlas in connexion with M.\r\nAgassiz's 'Systeme Glaciaire.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROF. J. D. FORBES INVITED.]\r\n\r\nM. Agassiz is a naturalist, and he appears to have devoted but little\r\nattention to the study of physics. At all events, the physical portions\r\nof his writings appear to me to be very often defective. It was probably\r\nhis own consciousness of this deficiency that led him to invoke the\r\nadvice of Arago and others previous to setting out upon his excursions.\r\nIt was also his desire \"to see a philosopher so justly celebrated occupy\r\nhimself with the subject,\" which induced him to invite Prof. J. D.\r\nForbes of Edinburgh to be his guest upon the Aar glacier in 1841. On the\r\n8th of August they met at the Grimsel Hospice, and for three weeks\r\nafterwards they were engaged together daily upon the ice, sharing at\r\nnight the shelter of the same rude roof. It is in reference to this\r\nvisit that Prof. Forbes writes thus at page 38 of the 'Travels in the\r\nAlps':--\"Far from being ready to admit, as my sanguine companions wished\r\nme to do in 1841, that the theory of glaciers was complete, and the\r\ncause of their motion certain, after patiently hearing all they had to\r\nsay and reserving my opinion, I drew the conclusion that no theory which\r\nI had then heard of could account for the few facts admitted on all\r\nhands.\" In 1842 Prof. Forbes repaired, as early as the state of the snow\r\npermitted, to the Mer de Glace; he worked there, in the first instance,\r\nfor a week, and afterwards crossed over to Courmayeur to witness a solar\r\neclipse. The result of his week's observations was immediately\r\ncommunicated to Prof. Jameson, then editor of the 'Edinburgh New\r\nPhilosophical Journal.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CENTRE MOVES QUICKEST.]\r\n\r\nIn that letter he announces the fact, but gives no details of the\r\nmeasurement, that \"the central part of the glacier moves faster than the\r\nedges in a very considerable proportion; quite contrary to the opinion\r\ngenerally entertained.\" He also announced at the same time the\r\ncontinuous hourly advance of the glacier. This letter bears the date,\r\n\"Courmayeur, Piedmont, 4th July,\" but it was not published until the\r\nmonth of October following.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile M. Agassiz, in company with M. Wild, returned to complete his\r\nexperiment upon the glacier of the Aar. On the 20th of July, 1842, the\r\ndisplacements of the six piles which he had planted the year before were\r\ndetermined by means of a theodolite. Of the three upon the Finsteraar\r\naffluent, that nearest the side had moved 160 feet, the next 225 feet,\r\nwhile that nearest to the centre had moved 269 feet. Of those on the\r\nLauteraar, that nearest the side had moved 125 feet, the next 210 feet,\r\nand that nearest the centre 246 feet. These observations were perfectly\r\nconclusive as to the quicker motion of the centre: they embrace a year's\r\nmotion; and the magnitude of the displacements, causing errors of\r\ninches, which might seriously affect small displacements, to vanish,\r\njustifies us in ranking this experiment with the most satisfactory of\r\nthe kind that have ever been made. The results were communicated to\r\nArago in a letter dated from the glacier of the Aar, on the 1st of\r\nAugust, 1842; they were laid before the Academy of Sciences on the 29th\r\nof August, 1842, and are published in the 'Comptes Rendus' of the same\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe facts, then, so far as I have been able to collect them, are as\r\nfollows:--M. Agassiz commenced his experiment about ten months before\r\nProfessor Forbes, and the results of his measurements, with quantities\r\nstated, were communicated to the French Academy about two months prior\r\nto the publication of the letter of Professor Forbes in the 'Edinburgh\r\nPhilosophical Journal.' But the latter communication, announcing in\r\ngeneral terms the fact of the speedier central motion, was dated from\r\nCourmayeur twenty-seven days before the date of M. Agassiz's letter\r\nfrom the glacier of the Aar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STATE OF THE QUESTION.]\r\n\r\nThe speedier motion of the central portion of a glacier has been justly\r\nregarded as one of cardinal importance, and no other observation has\r\nbeen the subject of such frequent reference; but the general impression\r\nin England is that M. Agassiz had neither part nor lot in the\r\nestablishment of the above fact; and in no English work with which I am\r\nacquainted can I find any reference to the above measurements. Relying\r\nindeed upon such sources for my information, I remained ignorant of the\r\nexistence of the paper in the 'Comptes Rendus' until my attention was\r\ndirected to it by Professor Wheatstone. In the next following chapters I\r\nshall have to state the results of some of my own measurements, and\r\nshall afterwards devote a little time to the consideration of the cause\r\nof glacier-motion. In treating a question on which so much has been\r\nwritten, it is of course impossible, as it would be undesirable, to\r\navoid subjecting both my own views and those of others to a critical\r\nexamination. But in so doing I hope that no expression shall escape me\r\ninconsistent with the courtesy which ought to be habitual among\r\nphilosophers or with the frank recognition of the just claims of my\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTION OF THE MER DE GLACE.\r\n\r\n(10.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MY FIRST OBSERVATION.]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 14th of July, 1857, I made my first observation on the\r\nmotion of the Mer de Glace. Accompanied by Mr. Hirst I selected on the\r\nsteep slope of the Glacier des Bois a straight pinnacle of ice, the\r\nfront edge of which was perfectly vertical. In coincidence with this\r\nedge I fixed the vertical fibre of the theodolite, and permitted the\r\ninstrument to stand for three hours. On looking through it at the end of\r\nthis interval, the cross hairs were found projected against the white\r\nside of the pyramid; the whole mass having moved several inches\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nThe instrument here mentioned, which had long been in use among\r\nengineers and surveyors, was first applied to measure glacier-motion in\r\n1842; by Prof. Forbes on the Mer de Glace, and by M. Agassiz on the\r\nglacier of the Aar. The portion of the theodolite made use of is easily\r\nunderstood. The instrument is furnished with a telescope capable of\r\nturning up and down upon a pivot, without the slightest deviation right\r\nor left; and also capable of turning right or left without the slightest\r\ndeviation up or down. Within the telescope two pieces of spider's\r\nthread, so fine as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye, are drawn\r\nacross the tube and across each other. When we look through the\r\ntelescope we see these fibres, their point of intersection being exactly\r\nin the centre of the tube; and the instrument is furnished with screws\r\nby means of which this point can be fixed upon any desired object with\r\nthe utmost precision.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MODE OF MEASUREMENT.]\r\n\r\nIn setting a straight row of stakes across the glacier, our mode of\r\nproceeding was in all cases this:--The theodolite was placed on the\r\nmountain-side flanking the glacier, quite clear of the ice; and having\r\ndetermined the direction of a line perpendicular to the axis of the\r\nglacier, a well-defined object was sought at the opposite side of the\r\nvalley as close as possible to this direction; the object being, in some\r\ncases, the sharp edge of a cliff; in others, a projecting corner of\r\nrock; and, in others, a well-defined mark on the face of the rock. This\r\nobject and those around it were carefully sketched, so that on returning\r\nto the place it could be instantly recognized. On commencing a line the\r\npoint of intersection of the two spiders' threads within the telescope\r\nwas first fixed accurately upon the point thus chosen, and an assistant\r\ncarrying a straight baton was sent upon the ice. By rough signalling he\r\nfirst stood near the place where the first stake was to be driven in;\r\nand the object end of the telescope was then lowered until he came\r\nwithin the field of view. He held his staff upright upon the ice, and,\r\nin obedience to signals, moved upwards or downwards until the point of\r\nintersection of the spiders-threads exactly hit the bottom of the baton;\r\na concerted signal was then made, the ice was pierced with an auger to a\r\ndepth of about sixteen inches, and a stake about two feet long was\r\nfirmly driven into it. The assistant then advanced for some distance\r\nacross the glacier; the end of the telescope was now gently raised until\r\nhe and his upright staff again appeared in the field of view. He then\r\nmoved as before until the bottom of his staff was struck by the point of\r\nintersection, and here a second stake was fixed in the ice. In this way\r\nthe process was continued until the line of stakes was completed.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the station, a plummet was suspended from a hook\r\ndirectly underneath the centre of the theodolite, and the place where\r\nthe point touched the ground was distinctly marked. To measure the\r\nmotion of the line of stakes, we returned to the place a day or two\r\nafterwards, and by means of the plummet were able to make the theodolite\r\noccupy the exact position which it occupied when the line was set out.\r\nThe telescope being directed upon the point at the opposite side of the\r\nvalley, and gradually lowered, it was found that no single stake along\r\nthe line preserved its first position: they had all shifted downwards.\r\nThe assistant was sent to the first stake; the point which it had first\r\noccupied was again determined, and its present distance from that point\r\naccurately measured. The same thing was done in the case of each stake,\r\nand thus the displacement of the whole row of stakes was ascertained.[A]\r\nThe time at which the stake was fixed, and at which its displacement was\r\nmeasured, being carefully noted, a simple calculation determined _the\r\ndaily motion_ of the stake.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FIRST LINE.]\r\n\r\nThus, on the 17th of July, 1857, we set out our first line across the\r\nMer de Glace, at some distance below the Montanvert; on the day\r\nfollowing we measured the progress of the stakes. The observed\r\ndisplacements are set down in the following table:--\r\n\r\nFirst Line.--Daily Motion.\r\n\r\n  No. of stake.   Inches.\r\n  West 1   moved   12-1/4\r\n       2     \"     16-3/4\r\n       3     \"     22-1/2\r\n       4     \"     ...\r\n       5     \"     24-1/2\r\n       6   moved   ...\r\n       7     \"     26-1/4\r\n       8     \"     ...\r\n       9     \"     28-3/4\r\n      10     \"     35-1/2 East.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CENTRE-POINT NOT THE QUICKEST.]\r\n\r\nThe theodolite in this case stood on the Montanvert side of the valley,\r\nand the stakes are numbered from this side. We see that the motion\r\ngradually augments from the 1st stake onward--the 1st stake being held\r\nback by the friction of the ice against the flanking mountain-side. The\r\nstakes 4, 6, and 8 have no motion attached to them, as an accident\r\nrendered the measurement of their displacements uncertain. But one\r\nremarkable fact is exhibited by this line; the 7th stake stood upon the\r\n_middle_ of the glacier, and we see that its motion is by no means the\r\nquickest; it is exceeded in this respect by the stakes 9 and 10.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the glacier on which the 10th stake stood was very much\r\ncut up by crevasses, and, while the assistant was boring it with his\r\nauger, the ice beneath him was observed, through the telescope, to slide\r\nsuddenly forward for about 4 inches. The other stakes retained their\r\npositions, so that the movement was purely local. Deducting the 4 inches\r\nthus irregularly obtained, we should have a daily motion of 31-1/2\r\ninches for stake No. 10. The place was watched for some time, but the\r\nslipping was not repeated; and a second measurement on the succeeding\r\nday made the motion of the 10th stake 32 inches, whilst that of the\r\ncentre of the glacier was only 27.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a fact which needed explanation; but, before attempting\r\nthis, I resolved, by repeated measurements in the same locality, to\r\nplace the existence of the fact beyond doubt. We therefore ascended to a\r\npoint upon the old and now motionless moraine, a little above the\r\nMontanvert Hotel; and choosing, as before, a well-defined object at the\r\nopposite side of the valley, we set between it and the theodolite a row\r\nof twenty stakes across the glacier. Their motions, measured on a\r\nsubsequent day, and reduced to their daily rate, gave the results set\r\ndown in the following table:--\r\n\r\nSecond Line.--Daily Motion.\r\n\r\n  No. of stake.   Inches.\r\n  West 1   moved    7-1/2\r\n       2     \"     10-3/4\r\n       3     \"     12-1/4\r\n       4     \"     14-1/2\r\n       5     \"     16\r\n       6     \"     16-3/4\r\n       7     \"     17-1/2\r\n       8     \"     19\r\n       9     \"     19-1/2\r\n      10     \"     21\r\n      11   moved   21\r\n      12     \"     22-1/2\r\n      13     \"     21\r\n      14     \"     22-1/2\r\n      15     \"     20-1/2\r\n      16     \"     21-3/4\r\n      17     \"     22-1/4\r\n      18     \"     25-1/4\r\n      19     \"     ...\r\n      20     \"     25-3/4 East.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CORROBORATIVE MEASUREMENTS.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the retardation of the side, we observe here the same fact as\r\nthat revealed by our first line--the motion gradually augments from the\r\nfirst stake to the last. The stake No. 20 stood upon the dirty portion\r\nof the ice, which was derived from the Talefre tributary of the Mer de\r\nGlace, and far beyond the middle of the glacier. These measurements,\r\ntherefore, corroborate that made lower down, as regards the\r\nnon-coincidence of the point of swiftest motion with the centre of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\nBut it will be observed that the measurements do not show any\r\nretardation of the ice at the eastern extremity of the line of\r\nstakes--the motion goes on augmenting from the first stake to the last.\r\nThe reason of this is, that in neither of the cases recorded were we\r\nable to get the line quite across the glacier; the crevasses and broken\r\nice-ridges, which intercepted the vision, compelled us to halt before we\r\ncame sufficiently close to the eastern side to make its retardation\r\nsensible. But on the 20th of July my friend Hirst sought out an elevated\r\nstation on the Chapeau, or eastern side of the valley, whence he could\r\ncommand a view from side to side over all the humps and inequalities of\r\nthe ice, the fixed point at the opposite side, upon which the telescope\r\nwas directed, being the corner of a window of the Montanvert Hotel.\r\nAlong this line were placed twelve stakes, the daily motions of which\r\nwere found to be as follows:--\r\n\r\nThird Line.--Daily Motion.\r\n\r\n  No. of stake.   Inches.\r\n  East 1   moved   19-1/2\r\n       2     \"     22-3/4\r\n       3     \"     28-3/4\r\n       4     \"     30-1/4\r\n       5     \"     33-3/4\r\n       6     \"     28-1/4\r\n       7   moved   24-1/2\r\n       8     \"     25\r\n       9     \"     25\r\n      10     \"     18\r\n      11     \"     ...\r\n      12     \"      8-1/2 West.\r\n\r\nThe numbering of the stakes along this line commenced from the\r\nChapeau-side of the glacier, and the retardation of that side is now\r\nmanifest enough; the motion gradually augmenting from 19-1/2 to 33-1/2\r\ninches. But, comparing the velocity of the two extreme stakes, we find\r\nthat the retardation of stake 12 is much greater than that of stake 1.\r\nStake 5, moreover, which moved with the _maximum_ velocity, was not upon\r\nthe centre of the glacier, but much nearer to the eastern than to the\r\nwestern side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A NEW PECULIARITY OF GLACIER MOTION.]\r\n\r\nIt was thus placed beyond doubt that the point of maximum motion of the\r\nMer de Glace, at the place referred to, is not the centre of the\r\nglacier. But, to make assurance doubly sure, I examined the comparative\r\nmotion along three other lines, and found in all the same undeviating\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThis result is not only unexpected, but is quite at variance with the\r\nopinions hitherto held regarding the motion of the Mer de Glace. The\r\nreader knows that the trunk-stream is composed of three great\r\ntributaries from the Geant, the Lechaud, and the Talefre. The Glacier du\r\nGeant fills more than half of the trunk-valley, and the junction between\r\nit and its neighbours is plainly marked by the dirt upon the surface of\r\nthe latter. In fact four medial moraines are crowded together on the\r\neastern side of the glacier, and before reaching the Montanvert they\r\nhave strewn their debris quite over the adjacent ice. A distinct limit\r\nis thus formed between the clean Glacier du Geant and the other dirty\r\ntributaries of the trunk-stream.\r\n\r\nNow the eastern side of the Mer de Glace is observed on the whole to be\r\nmuch more fiercely torn than the western side, and this excessive\r\ncrevassing has been referred to _the swifter motion of the Glacier du\r\nGeant_. It has been thought that, like a powerful river, this glacier\r\ndrags its more sluggish neighbours after it, and thus tears them in the\r\nmanner observed. But the measurement of the foregoing three lines shows\r\nthat this cannot be the true cause of the crevassing. In each case the\r\nstakes which moved quickest _lay upon the dirty portion of the\r\ntrunk-stream_, far to the east of the line of junction of the Glacier du\r\nGeant, which in fact moved slowest of all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LAW OF MOTION SOUGHT.]\r\n\r\nThe general view of the glacier, and of the shape of the valley which it\r\nfilled, suggested to me that the analogy with a river might perhaps make\r\nitself good beyond the limits hitherto contemplated. The valley was not\r\nstraight, but sinuous. At the Montanvert the convex side of the glacier\r\nwas turned eastward; at some distance higher up, near the passages\r\ncalled _Les Ponts_, it was turned westward; and higher up again it was\r\nturned once more, for a long stretch, eastward. Thus between Trelaporte\r\nand the Ponts we had what is called a point of contrary flexure, and\r\nbetween the Ponts and the Montanvert a second point of the same kind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONJECTURE REGARDING CHANGE OF FLEXURE.]\r\n\r\nSupposing a river, instead of the glacier, to sweep through this valley;\r\n_its_ point of maximum motion would not always remain central, but would\r\ndeviate towards that side of the valley to which the river turned its\r\nconvex boundary. Indeed the positions of towns along the banks of a\r\nnavigable river are mainly determined by this circumstance. They are,\r\nin most cases, situate on the convex sides of the bends, where the rush\r\nof the water prevents silting up. Can it be then that the ice exhibits a\r\nsimilar deportment? that the same principle which regulates the\r\ndistribution of people along the banks of the Thames is also acting with\r\nsilent energy amid the glaciers of the Alps? If this be the case, the\r\nposition of the point of maximum motion ought, of course, to shift with\r\nthe bending of the glacier. Opposite the Ponts, for example, the point\r\nought to be on the Glacier du Geant, and westward of the centre of the\r\ntrunk-stream; while, higher up, we ought to have another change to the\r\neastern side, in accordance with the change of flexure.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July a line was set out across the glacier, one of its\r\nfixed termini being a mark upon the first of the three Ponts. The motion\r\nof this line, measured on a subsequent day, and reduced to its daily\r\nrate, was found to be as follows:--\r\n\r\nFourth Line.--Daily Motion.\r\n\r\n  No. of stake.   Inches.\r\n  East 1   moved    6-1/2\r\n       2     \"      8\r\n       3     \"     12-1/2\r\n       4     \"     15-1/4\r\n       5     \"     15-1/2\r\n       6     \"     18-3/4\r\n       7     \"     18-1/4\r\n       8     \"     18-3/4\r\n       9     \"     19-1/2\r\n      10   moved   21\r\n      11     \"     20-1/2\r\n      12     \"     23-1/4\r\n      13     \"     23-1/4\r\n      14     \"     21\r\n      15     \"     22-1/4\r\n      16     \"     17-1/4\r\n      17     \"     15 West.\r\n\r\nThis line, like the third, was set out and numbered from the eastern\r\nside of the glacier, the theodolite occupying a position on the heights\r\nof the Echelets. A moment's inspection of the table reveals a fact\r\ndifferent from that observed on the third line; _there_ the most\r\neasterly stake moved with more than twice the velocity of the most\r\nwesterly one; _here_, on the contrary, the most westerly stake moves\r\nwith more than twice the velocity of the most easterly one.\r\n\r\nTo enable me to compare the motion of the eastern and western halves of\r\nthe glacier with greater strictness, my able and laborious companion\r\nundertook the task of measuring with a surveyor's chain the line just\r\nreferred to; noting the pickets which had been fixed along the line, and\r\nthe other remarkable objects which it intersected. The difficulty of\r\nthus directing a chain over crevasses and ridges can hardly be\r\nappreciated except by those who have tried it. Nevertheless, the task\r\nwas accomplished, and the width of the Mer de Glace, at this portion of\r\nits course, was found to be 863 yards, or almost exactly half a mile.\r\n\r\nReferring to the last table, it will be seen that the two stakes\r\nnumbered 12 and 13 moved with a common velocity of 23-1/4 inches per\r\nday, and that their motion is swifter than that of any of the others.\r\nThe point of swiftest motion may be taken midway between them, and this\r\npoint was found by measurement to lie 233 yards _west_ of the dirt which\r\nmarked the junction of the Glacier du Geant with its fellow tributaries:\r\nwhereas, in the former cases, it lay a considerable distance _east_ of\r\nthis limit. Its distance from the eastern side of the glacier was 601\r\nyards, and from the western side 262 yards, being 170 yards west of the\r\ncentre of the glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONJECTURE TESTED.]\r\n\r\nBut the measurements enabled me to take the stakes in pairs, and to\r\ncompare the velocity of a number of them which stood at certain\r\ndistances from the eastern side of the valley, with an equal number\r\nwhich stood at the same distances from the western side. By thus\r\narranging the points two by two, I was able to compare the motion of the\r\nentire body of the ice at the one side of the central line with that of\r\nthe ice at the other side. Stake 17 stood about as far from the western\r\nside of the glacier as stake 3 did from its eastern side; 16 occupied\r\nthe same relation to 4; 15, to 5; 13, to 7; and 12, to 9.\r\n\r\nCalling each pair of points which thus stand at equal distances from the\r\nopposite sides _corresponding points_, the following little table\r\nexhibits their comparative motions:--\r\n\r\nNumbers and Velocities of Corresponding Points on the Fourth Line.\r\n\r\n        No. Vel.

We see that while stake 17, which stands\r\n_west_ of the centre, moves 15 inches, stake 3, which stands an equal\r\ndistance _east_ of the centre, moves only 12-1/2 inches. Comparing every\r\npair of the other points, we find the same to hold good; the western\r\nstake moves in each case faster than the corresponding eastern one.\r\nHence, _the entire western half of the Mer de Glace, at the place\r\ncrossed by our fourth line, moves more quickly than the eastern half of\r\nthe glacier_.\r\n\r\nWe next proceeded farther up, and tested the contrary curvature of the\r\nglacier, opposite to Trelaporte. The station chosen for this purpose was\r\non a grassy platform of the promontory, whence, on the 28th of July, a\r\nrow of stakes was fixed at right angles to the axis of the glacier.\r\nTheir motions, measured on the 31st, gave the following results:--\r\n\r\nFifth Line.[B]--Daily Motion.\r\n\r\n  No. of stake.

The entire width of the glacier here was found to\r\nbe 893 yards, or somewhat wider than it is at the Ponts. It will also be\r\nobserved that its motion is somewhat slower.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the notes of this line showed me that stakes 3 and 14,\r\n4 and 12, 7 and 10, were \"corresponding points;\" the first of each pair\r\nstanding as far from the western side, as the second stood from the\r\neastern. In the following table these points and their velocities are\r\narranged exactly as in the case of the fourth line.\r\n\r\nNumbers and Velocities of the Corresponding Points on the Fifth Line.\r\n\r\n         No. Vel.

This is the reverse of the\r\nresult obtained at our fourth line, but it agrees with that obtained on\r\nour first three lines, where the curvature of the valley is similar. The\r\nanalogy between a river and a glacier moving through a sinuous valley is\r\ntherefore complete.\r\n\r\nSupposing the points of maximum motion to be determined for a great\r\nnumber of lines across the glacier, the line uniting all these points is\r\nwhat mathematicians would call the _locus_ of the point of maximum\r\nmotion. At Trelaporte this line would lie east of the centre; at the\r\nPonts it would lie west of the centre; hence, in passing from Trelaporte\r\nto the Ponts, it must cross the axis of the glacier. Again, at the\r\nMontanvert, it would lie east of the centre, and between the Ponts and\r\nthe Montanvert the axis of the glacier would be crossed a second time.\r\nSupposing the dotted line in Fig. 21 to represent the middle line of the\r\nglacier, then the defined line would represent the locus of the point of\r\nmaximum motion. _It is a curve more deeply sinuous than the valley\r\nitself, and it crosses the axis of the glacier at each point of contrary\r\nflexure._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LOCUS OF POINT OF SWIFTEST MOTION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Locus of the Point of Maximum Motion.]\r\n\r\nTo complete our knowledge of the motion of the Mer de Glace, we\r\nafterwards determined the velocity of its two accessible\r\ntributaries--the Glacier du Geant, and the Glacier de Lechaud. On the\r\n29th of July, a line of stakes was set out across the former, a little\r\nabove the Tacul, and their motion was subsequently found to be as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nSixth Line.--Daily Motion.\r\n\r\n  No. of stake.

The displacements of the stakes,\r\nmeasured on the 3rd of August, gave the following results:--\r\n\r\nSeventh Line.--Daily Motion.\r\n\r\n  No. of stake.

This is the slowest rate which we observed upon either the Mer de\r\nGlace or its tributaries. The width of the Talefre-branch, as it\r\ndescends the cascade, or, in other words, before it is influenced by the\r\npressure of the Lechaud, was found approximately to be 638 yards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SQUEEZING AT TRELAPORTE.]\r\n\r\nThe widths of the tributaries were determined for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the amount of lateral compression endured by the ice in its\r\npassage through the neck of the valley at Trelaporte. Adding all\r\ntogether we have--\r\n\r\n  Geant              1134 yards.\r\n  Lechaud             825   \"\r\n  Talefre             638   \"\r\n          Total      2597 yards.\r\n\r\nThese three branches, as shown by the actual measurement of our 5th\r\nline, are forced at Trelaporte through a channel 893 yards wide; the\r\nwidth of the trunk stream is a little better than one-third of that of\r\nits tributaries, and it passes through this gorge at a velocity of\r\nnearly 20 inches a day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LECHAUD A DRIBLET.]\r\n\r\nLimiting our view to one of the tributaries only, the result is still\r\nmore impressive. Previous to its junction with the Talefre, the Glacier\r\nde Lechaud stretches before the observer as a broad river of ice,\r\nmeasuring 825 yards across: at Trelaporte it is squeezed, in a frozen\r\nvice, between the Talefre on one side and the Geant on the other, to a\r\ndriblet, measuring 85 yards in width, or about one-tenth of its former\r\ntransverse dimension. It will of course be understood that it is the\r\n_form_ and not the _volume_ of the glacier that is affected to this\r\nenormous extent by the pressure.\r\n\r\nSupposing no waste took place, the Glacier de Lechaud would force\r\nprecisely the same amount of ice through the \"narrows\" at Trelaporte, in\r\none day, as it sends past the Pierre de Beranger. At the latter place\r\nits velocity is about half of what it is at the former, but its width is\r\nmore than nine times as great. Hence, if no waste took place, its\r\n_depth_, at Trelaporte, would be at _least_ 4-1/2 times its depth\r\nopposite the Pierre de Beranger. Superficial and subglacial melting\r\ngreatly modify this result. Still I think it extremely probable that\r\nobservations directed to this end would prove the comparative\r\nshallowness of the upper portions of the Glacier de Lechaud.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Great care is necessary on the part of the man who measures the\r\ndisplacements. The staff ought to be placed along the original line, and\r\nthe assistant ought to walk along it until the foot of a _perpendicular_\r\nfrom the stake is attained. When several days' motion is to be measured,\r\nthis precaution is absolutely necessary; the eye being liable to be\r\ngrossly deceived in _guessing_ the direction of a perpendicular.\r\n\r\n[B] The details of the measurement of the fourth and fifth lines are\r\npublished in the 'Philosophical Transactions,' vol. cxlix., p. 261.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICE-WALL AT THE TACUL.\r\n\r\nVELOCITIES OF TOP AND BOTTOM.\r\n\r\n(11.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs regards the motion of the _surface_ of a glacier, two laws are to be\r\nborne in mind: 1st, that regarding the quicker movement of the centre;\r\n2nd, that regarding the locus of the point of maximum motion. Our next\r\ncare must be to compare the motion of the surface of a glacier with the\r\nmotion of those parts which lie near its bed. Rendu first surmised that\r\nthe bottom of the glacier was retarded by friction, and both Professor\r\nForbes[A] and M. Martins[B] have confirmed the conjecture. Theirs are\r\nthe only observations which we possess upon the subject; and I was\r\nparticularly desirous to instruct myself upon this important head by\r\nmeasurements of my own.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIRST ATTEMPT AT MEASUREMENT.]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1857 the eastern side of the Glacier du Geant, near\r\nthe Tacul, exposed a nearly vertical precipice of ice, measuring 140\r\nfeet from top to bottom. I requested Mr. Hirst to fix two stakes in the\r\nsame vertical plane, one at the top of the precipice and one near the\r\nbottom. This he did upon the 3rd of August, and on the 5th I accompanied\r\nhim to measure the progress of the stakes. On the summit of the\r\nprecipice, and running along it, was the lateral moraine of the glacier.\r\nThe day was warm and the ice liquefying rapidly, so that the boulders\r\nand debris, deprived incessantly of their support, came in frequent\r\nleaps and rushes down the precipice. Into this peril my guide was about\r\nto enter, to measure the displacement of the lower stake, while I was\r\nto watch, and call out the direction in which he was to run when a stone\r\ngave way. But I soon found that the initial motion was no sure index of\r\nthe final motion. By striking the precipice, the stones were often\r\ndeflected, and carried wide of their original direction. I therefore\r\nstopped the man, and sent him to the summit of the precipice to remove\r\nall the more dangerous blocks. This accomplished, he descended, and\r\nwhile I stood beside him, executed the required measurement. From the\r\n3rd to the 5th of August the upper stake had moved twelve inches, and\r\nthe lower one six.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately some uncertainty attached itself to this result, due to\r\nthe difficulty of fixing the lower stake. The guide's attention had been\r\ndivided between his work and his safety, and he had to retreat more than\r\na dozen times from the falling boulders and debris. I, on the other\r\nhand, was unwilling to accept an observation of such importance with a\r\nshade of doubt attached to it. Hence arose the desire to measure the\r\nmotion myself. On the 11th of August I therefore reascended to the\r\nTacul, and fixed a stake at the top of the precipice, and another at the\r\nbottom. While sitting on the old moraine looking at the two pickets, the\r\nimportance of determining the motion of a point midway between the top\r\nand bottom forcibly occurred to me, but, on mentioning it to my guide,\r\nhe promptly pronounced any attempt of the kind absurd.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STAKES FIXED AT TOP, BOTTOM, AND CENTRE.]\r\n\r\nOn scanning the place carefully, however, the value of the observation\r\nappeared to me to outweigh the amount of danger. I therefore took my\r\naxe, placed a stake and an auger against my breast, buttoned my coat\r\nupon them, and cut an oblique staircase up the wall of ice, until I\r\nreached a height of forty feet from the bottom. Here the position of the\r\nstake being determined by Mr. Hirst, who was at the theodolite, I\r\npierced the ice with the auger, drove in the stake, and descended\r\nwithout injury. During the whole operation however my guide growled\r\naudibly.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we commenced the ascent of Mont Blanc, a\r\nnarrative of which is given in Part I. We calculated on an absence of\r\nthree days, and estimated that the stakes which had just been fixed\r\nwould be ready for measurement on our return; but we did not reach\r\nChamouni until the afternoon of Friday, the 14th. Heavy clouds settled,\r\nduring our descent, upon the summits behind us, and a thunder-peal from\r\nthe Aiguilles soon heralded a fall of rain, which continued without\r\nintermission till the afternoon of the 16th, when the atmosphere\r\ncleared, and showed the mountains clothed to their girdles with snow.\r\nThe Montanvert was thickly covered, and on our way to it we met the\r\nservants in charge of the cattle, which had been driven below the\r\nsnow-line to obtain food.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THROUGH GLOOM TO THE TACUL.]\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, the 17th, a dense fog filled the valley of the Mer de\r\nGlace. I watched it anxiously. The stakes which we had set at the Tacul\r\nhad been often in my thoughts, and I wished to make some effort to save\r\nthe labour and peril incurred in setting them from being lost. I\r\ntherefore set out, in one of the clear intervals, accompanied by my\r\nfriend and Simond, determined to measure the motion of the stakes, if\r\npossible, or to fix them more firmly, if they still stood. As we passed,\r\nhowever, from l'Angle to the glacier, the fog became so dense and\r\nblinding that we halted. At my request Mr. Hirst returned to the\r\nMontanvert; and Simond, leaving the theodolite in the shelter of a rock,\r\naccompanied me through the obscurity to the Tacul. We found the topmost\r\nstake still stuck by its point in the ice; but the two others had\r\ndisappeared, and we afterwards discovered their fragments in a\r\nsnow-buttress, which reared itself against the base of the precipice.\r\nThey had been hit by the falling stones, and crushed to pieces. Having\r\nthus learned the worst, we descended to the Montanvert amid drenching\r\nrain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESCENT OF BOULDERS.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 18th there was no cloud to be seen anywhere, and\r\nthe sunlight glistened brightly on the surface of the ice. We ascended\r\nto the Tacul. The spontaneous falling of the stones appeared more\r\nfrequent this morning than I had ever seen it. The sun shone with\r\nunmitigated power upon the ice, producing copious liquefaction. The\r\nrustle of falling debris was incessant, and at frequent intervals the\r\nboulders leaped down the precipice, and rattled with startling energy\r\namid the rocks at its base. I sent Simond to the top to remove the\r\nlooser stones; he soon appeared, and urged the moraine-shingle in\r\nshowers down the precipice, upon a bevelled slope of which some blocks\r\nlong continued to rest. They were out of the reach of the guide's baton,\r\nand he sought to dislodge them by sending other stones down upon them.\r\nSome of them soon gave way, drawing a train of smaller shingle after\r\nthem; others required to be hit many times before they yielded, and\r\nothers refused to be dislodged at all. I then cut my way up the\r\nprecipice in the manner already described, fixed the stake, and\r\ndescended as speedily as possible. We afterwards fixed the bottom stake,\r\nand on the 20th the displacements of all three were measured.[C] The\r\nspaces passed over by the respective stakes in 24 hours were found to be\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n                 Inches.\r\n  Top stake        6.00\r\n  Middle stake     4.50\r\n  Bottom stake     2.56\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOTION OF STAKES.]\r\n\r\nThe height of the precipice was 140.8 feet, but it sloped off at its\r\nupper portion. The height of the middle stake above the ground was 35\r\nfeet, and of the bottom one 4 feet. It is therefore proved by these\r\nmeasurements that the bottom of the ice-wall at the Tacul moves with\r\nless than half the velocity of the top; while the displacement of the\r\nintermediate stake shows how the velocity gradually increases from the\r\nbottom upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] 'Edinb. Phil. Journ.,' Oct. 1846, p. 417.\r\n\r\n[B] Agassiz, 'Systeme Glaciaire,' p. 522.\r\n\r\n[C] On this latter occasion my guide volunteered to cut the steps for me\r\nup to the pickets; and I permitted him to do so. In fact, he was at\r\nleast as anxious as myself to see the measurement carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER MOTION OF THE MER DE GLACE.\r\n\r\n(12.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter measurements were executed in the manner already described,\r\non the 28th and 29th of December, 1859. The theodolite was placed on the\r\nmountain's side flanking the glacier, and a well-defined object was\r\nchosen at the opposite side of the valley, so that a straight line\r\nbetween this object and the theodolite was approximately perpendicular\r\nto the axis of the glacier. Fixing the telescope in the first instance\r\nwith its cross hairs upon the object, its end was lowered until it\r\nstruck the point upon the glacier at which a stake was to be fixed.\r\nThanks to the intelligence of my assistants, after the fixing of the\r\nfirst stake they speedily took up the line at all other points,\r\nrequiring very little correction to make their positions perfectly\r\naccurate. On the day following that on which the stakes were driven in,\r\nthe theodolite was placed in the same position, and the distances to\r\nwhich the stakes had moved from their original positions were accurately\r\ndetermined. As already stated, the first line crossed the glacier about\r\n80 yards above the Montanvert Hotel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HALF OF SUMMER MOTION.]\r\n\r\nLine No. I.--Winter Motion in Twenty-four Hours.\r\n\r\n  No. of stake.

These measurements also show that in winter, as well as in\r\nsummer, the side of the glacier opposite to the Montanvert moves quicker\r\nthan that adjacent to it. The stake which moved with the maximum\r\nvelocity was beyond the moraine of La Noire. The second line crossed the\r\nglacier about 130 yards below the Montanvert.\r\n\r\nLine No. II.--Winter Motion in Twenty-four Hours.\r\n\r\n  No. of stake.

The summer maximum at this portion of the glacier also exceeds\r\nthat of the part intersected by line No. 1. The surface of the glacier\r\nbetween the two lines is in a state of tension which relieves itself by\r\na system of transverse fissures, and thus permits of the quicker advance\r\nof the forward portion.\r\n\r\nMy desire, in making these measurements, was, in the first place, to\r\nraise the winter observations of the motion to the same degree of\r\naccuracy as that already possessed by the summer ones. Auguste Balmat\r\nhad already made a series of winter observations on the Mer de Glace;\r\nbut they were made in the way employed before the introduction of the\r\ntheodolite by Agassiz and Forbes, and shared the unavoidable roughness\r\nof such a mode of measurement. They moreover gave us no information as\r\nto the motion of the different parts of the glacier along the same\r\ntransverse line, and this, for reasons which will appear subsequently,\r\nwas the point of chief interest to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF GLACIER-MOTION.\r\n\r\nDE SAUSSURE'S THEORY.\r\n\r\n(13.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first attempt at forming a glacier-theory is that of\r\nScheuchzer in 1705. He supposed the motion to be caused by the\r\nconversion of water into ice within the glacier; the known and almost\r\nirresistible expansion which takes place on freezing, furnishing the\r\nforce which pushed the glacier downward. This idea was illustrated and\r\ndeveloped with so much skill by M. de Charpentier, that his name has\r\nbeen associated with it; and it is commonly known as the Theory of\r\nCharpentier, or the Dilatation-Theory. M. Agassiz supported this theory\r\nfor a time, but his own thermometric experiments show us that the body\r\nof the glacier is at a temperature of 32 deg. Fahr.; that consequently there\r\nis no interior magazine of cold to freeze the water with which the\r\nglacier is supposed to be incessantly saturated. So that these\r\nexperiments alone, if no other grounds existed, would prove the\r\ninsufficiency of the theory of dilatation. I may however add, that the\r\narguments most frequently urged against this theory deal with an\r\nassumption, which I do not think its author ever intended to make.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GLACIER SLIDES.]\r\n\r\nAnother early surmise was that of Altmann and Gruener (1760), both of\r\nwhom conjectured that the glacier slid along its bed. This theory\r\nreceived distinct expression from De Saussure in 1799; and has since\r\nbeen associated with the name of that great alpine traveller, being\r\nusually called the 'Theory of Saussure,' and sometimes the 'Sliding\r\nTheory.' It is briefly stated in these words:--\r\n\r\n\"Almost every glacier reposes upon an inclined bed, and those of any\r\nconsiderable size have beneath them, even in winter, currents of water\r\nwhich flow between the ice and the bed which supports it. It may\r\ntherefore be understood that these frozen masses, drawn down the slope\r\non which they repose, disengaged by the water from all adhesion to the\r\nbottom, sometimes even raised by this water, must glide by little and\r\nlittle, and descend, following the inclinations of the valleys, or of\r\nthe slopes which they cover. It is this slow but continual sliding of\r\nthe ice on its inclined base which carries it into the lower\r\nvalleys.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRAINED INTERPRETATION.]\r\n\r\nDe Saussure devoted but little time to the subject of glacier-motion;\r\nand the absence of completeness in the statement of his views, arising\r\nno doubt from this cause, has given subsequent writers occasion to affix\r\nwhat I cannot help thinking a strained interpretation to the sliding\r\ntheory. It is alleged that he regarded a glacier as a perfectly rigid\r\nbody; that he considered it to be \"a mass of ice of small depth, and\r\nconsiderable but uniform breadth, sliding down a uniform valley, or\r\npouring from a narrow valley into a wider one.\"[B] The introduction \"of\r\nthe smallest flexibility or plasticity\" is moreover emphatically denied\r\nto him.[C]\r\n\r\nIt is by no means probable that the great author of the 'Voyages' would\r\nhave subscribed to this \"rigid\" annotation. His theory, be it\r\nremembered, is to some extent _true_: the glacier moves over its bed in\r\nthe manner supposed, and the rocks of Britain bear to this day the\r\ntraces of these mighty sliders. De Saussure probably contented himself\r\nwith a general statement of what he believed to be the substantial\r\ncause of the motion. He visited the Jardin, and saw the tributaries of\r\nthe Mer de Glace turning round corners, welding themselves together, and\r\nafterwards moving through a sinuous trunk-valley; and it is scarcely\r\ncredible that in the presence of such facts he would have denied all\r\nflexibility to the glacier.\r\n\r\nThe statement that he regarded a glacier to be a mass of ice of uniform\r\nwidth, is moreover plainly inconsistent with the following description\r\nof the glacier of Mont Dolent: \"Its most elevated plateau is a great\r\ncircus, surrounded by high cliffs of granite, of pyramidal forms; thence\r\nthe glacier descends through a gorge, in which _it is narrowed_; but\r\nafter having passed the gorge, it _enlarges again_, spreading out like a\r\nfan. Thus it has on the whole the form of a sheaf tied in the middle and\r\ndilated at its two extremities.\"[D]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLACIER OF MONT DOLENT.]\r\n\r\nCuriously enough this very glacier, and these very words, are selected\r\nby M. Rendu as illustrative of the plasticity of glaciers. \"Nothing,\" he\r\nsays, \"shows better the extent to which a glacier moulds itself to its\r\nlocality than the form of the glacier of Mont Dolent in the Valley of\r\nFerret;\" and he adds, in connexion with the same passage, these\r\nremarkable words:--\"There is a multitude of facts which would seem to\r\nnecessitate the belief that the substance of glaciers enjoys a kind of\r\nductility which permits it to mould itself to the locality which it\r\noccupies, to grow thin, to swell, and to narrow itself like a soft\r\npaste.\"[E]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] 'Voyages,' Sec. 535.\r\n\r\n[B] James D.

Rendu, Bishop of Annecy, to whose writings I have just referred, died\r\nlast autumn.[A] He was a man of great repute in his diocese, and we owe\r\nto him one of the most remarkable essays upon glaciers that have ever\r\nappeared. His knowledge was extensive, his reasoning close and accurate,\r\nand his faculty of observation extraordinary. With these were associated\r\nthat intuitive power, that presentiment concerning things as yet\r\nuntouched by experiment, which belong only to the higher class of minds.\r\nThroughout his essay a constant effort after quantitative accuracy\r\nreveals itself. He collects observations, makes experiments, and tries\r\nto obtain numerical results; always taking care, however, so to state\r\nhis premises and qualify his conclusions that nobody shall be led to\r\nascribe to his numbers a greater accuracy than they merit. It is\r\nimpossible to read his work, and not feel that he was a man of\r\nessentially truthful mind, and that science missed an ornament when he\r\nwas appropriated by the Church.\r\n\r\nThe essay above referred to is printed in the tenth volume of the\r\nMemoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Savoy, published in 1841,\r\nand is entitled, '_Theorie des Glaciers de la Savoie, par M. le Chanoine\r\nRendu, Chevalier du Merite Civil et Secretaire perpetuel_.' The paper\r\nhad been written for nearly two years, and might have remained\r\nunprinted, had not another publication on the same subject called it\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nI will place a few of the leading points of this remarkable production\r\nbefore the reader; commencing with a generalization which is highly\r\nsuggestive of the character of the author's mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"THEORIE DES GLACIERS DE LA SAVOIE.\"]\r\n\r\nHe reflects on the accumulation of the mountain-snows, each year adding\r\nfifty-eight inches of ice to a glacier. This would make Mont Blanc four\r\nhundred feet higher in a century, and four thousand feet higher in a\r\nthousand years. \"It is evident,\" he says, \"that nothing like this occurs\r\nin nature.\" The escape of the ice then leads him to make some general\r\nremarks on what he calls the \"law of circulation.\" \"The conserving will\r\nof the Creator has employed for the permanence of His work the great law\r\nof _circulation_, which, strictly examined, is found to reproduce itself\r\nin all parts of nature. The waters circulate from the ocean to the air,\r\nfrom the air to the earth, and from the earth to the ocean.... The\r\nelements of organic substances circulate, passing from the solid to the\r\nliquid or aeriform condition, and thence again to the state of solidity\r\nor of organisation. That universal agent which we designate by the names\r\nof fire, light, electricity, and magnetism, has probably also a\r\n_circulation_ as wide as the universe.\" The italics here are Rendu's\r\nown. This was published in 1841, but written, we are informed, nearly\r\ntwo years before. In 1842 Mr. Grove wrote thus:--\"Light, heat,\r\nmagnetism, motion, and chemical affinity, are all convertible material\r\naffections.\" More recently Helmholtz, speaking of the \"circuit\" formed\r\nby \"heat, light, electricity, magnetism, and chemical affinity,\" writes\r\nthus:--\"Starting from each of these different manifestations of natural\r\nforces, we can set every other in action.\" I quote these passages\r\nbecause they refer to the same agents as those named by M. Rendu, and to\r\nwhich he ascribes \"_circulation_.\" Can it be doubted that this Savoyard\r\npriest had a premonition of the Conservation of Force? I do not want to\r\nlay more stress than it deserves upon a conjecture of this kind; but\r\nits harmony with an essay remarkable for its originality gives it a\r\nsignificance which, if isolated, it might not possess.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLACIERS RIGHTLY DIVIDED.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the glaciers, Rendu commences by dividing them into two\r\nkinds, or rather the selfsame glacier into two parts, one of which he\r\ncalls the \"_glacier reservoir_,\" the other the \"_glacier\r\nd'ecoulement_,\"--two terms highly suggestive of the physical\r\nrelationship of the _neve_ and the glacier proper. He feeds the\r\nreservoirs from three sources, the principal one of which is the snow,\r\nto which he adds the rain, and the vapours which are condensed upon the\r\nheights without passing into the state of either rain or snow. The\r\nconversion of the snow into ice he supposes to be effected by four\r\ndifferent causes, the most efficacious of which is _pressure_.[B] It is\r\nneedless to remark that this quite agrees with the views now generally\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nIn page 60 of the volume referred to there is a passage which shows that\r\nthe \"veined structure\" of the glacier had not escaped him, though it\r\nwould seem that he ascribed it to stratification. \"When,\" he writes, \"we\r\nperceive the profile of a glacier on the walls of a crevasse, we see\r\ndifferent layers distinct in colour, but more particularly in density;\r\nsome seem to have the hardness, as they have the greenish colour, of\r\nglass; others preserve the whiteness and porosity of the snow.\" There is\r\nalso a very close resemblance between his views of the influence of\r\n\"time and cohesion\" and those of Prof. Forbes. \"We may conclude,\" he\r\nwrites, \"that _time_, favouring the action of _affinity_, and the\r\npressure of the layers one upon the other, causes the little crystals of\r\nwhich snow is composed to approach each other, bring them into contact,\r\nand convert them into ice.\"[C] Regelation also appears to have attracted\r\nhis notice.[D] \"When we fill an ice-house,\" he writes, \"we break the ice\r\ninto very small fragments; afterwards we wet it with water 8 or 10\r\ndegrees above zero (Cent.) in temperature; but, notwithstanding this,\r\nthe whole is converted into a compact mass of ice.\" He moreover\r\nmaintains, in almost the same language as Prof. Forbes,[E] the opinion,\r\nthat ice has always an inner temperature lower than zero (Cent.). He\r\nbelieved this to be a property \"inherent to ice.\" \"Never,\" he says, \"can\r\na calorific ray pass the first surface of ice to raise the temperature\r\nof the interior.\"[F]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OBSERVATIONS AND HYPOTHESES.]\r\n\r\nHe notices the direction of the glacier as influencing the wasting of\r\nits ridges by the sun's heat; ascribing to it the effect to which I have\r\nreferred in explaining the wave-like forms upon the surface of the Mer\r\nde Glace. His explanation of the Moulins, too, though insufficient,\r\nassigns a true cause, and is an excellent specimen of physical\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the diminution of the _glaciers reservoirs_, or, in other\r\nwords, to the manner in which the ice disappears, notwithstanding the\r\ncontinual additions made to it, we have the following remarkable\r\npassage:--\"In seeking the cause of the diminution of glaciers, it has\r\noccurred to my mind that the ice, notwithstanding its hardness and its\r\nrigidity, can only support a given pressure without breaking or being\r\nsqueezed out. According to this supposition, whenever the pressure\r\nexceeds that force, there will be rupture of the ice, and a flow in\r\nconsequence. Let us take, at the summit of Mont Blanc, a column of ice\r\nreposing on a horizontal base. The ice which forms the first layer of\r\nthat column is compressed by the weight of all the layers above it; but\r\nif the solidity of the said first layer can only support a weight equal\r\nto 100, when the weight exceeds this amount there will be rupture and\r\nspreading out of the ice of the base. Now, something very similar occurs\r\nin the immense crust of ice which covers the summits of Mont Blanc. This\r\ncrust appears to augment at the upper surface and to diminish by the\r\nsides. To assure oneself that the movement is due to the force of\r\npressure, it would be necessary to make a series of experiments upon the\r\nsolidity of ice, such as have not yet been attempted.\"[G] I may remark\r\nthat such experiments substantially verify M. Rendu's notion.\r\n\r\nBut it is his observations and reasoning upon the _glaciers\r\nd'ecoulement_ that chiefly interest us. The passages in his writings\r\nwhere he insists upon the power of the glaciers to mould themselves to\r\ntheir localities, and compares them to a soft paste, to lava at once\r\nductile and liquid, are well known from the frequent and flattering\r\nreferences of Professor Forbes; but there are others of much greater\r\nimportance, which have hitherto remained unknown in this country.\r\nRegarding the motion of the Mer de Glace, Rendu writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEASUREMENT OF MOTION.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SIDES OF THE GLACIER RETARDED.]\r\n\r\n\"I sought to appreciate the quantity of its motion; but I could only\r\ncollect rather vague data. I questioned my guides regarding the position\r\nof an enormous rock at the edge of the glacier, but still upon the ice,\r\nand consequently partaking of its motion. The guides showed me the place\r\nwhere it stood the preceding year, and where it had stood two, three,\r\nfour, and five years previously; they showed me the place where it would\r\nbe found in a year, in two years, &c.; _so certain are they of the\r\nregularity of the motion_. Their reports, however, did not always agree\r\nprecisely with each other, and their indications of time and distance\r\nlack the precision without which we proceed obscurely in the physical\r\nsciences. In reducing these different indications to a mean, I found the\r\ntotal advance of the glacier to be about 40 feet a year. During my last\r\njourney I obtained more certain data, which I have stated in the\r\npreceding chapter. _The enormous difference between the two results\r\narises from the fact that the latter observations were made at the\r\ncentre of the glacier_, WHICH MOVES MORE RAPIDLY, _while the former were\r\nmade at the side, where the ice_ IS RETAINED BY THE FRICTION AGAINST ITS\r\nROCKY WALLS.\"[H]\r\n\r\nAn opinion, founded on a grave misapprehension which Rendu enables us to\r\ncorrect, is now prevalent in this country, not only among the general\r\npublic, but also among those of the first rank in science. The nature of\r\nthe mistake will be immediately apparent. At page 128 of the 'Travels in\r\nthe Alps' its distinguished author gives a sketch of the state of our\r\nknowledge of glacier-motion previous to the commencement of his\r\ninquiries. He cites Ebel, Hugi, Agassiz, Bakewell, De la Beche,\r\nShirwell, Rendu, and places them in open contradiction to each other.\r\nRendu, he says, gives the motion of the Mer de Glace to be \"242 feet per\r\nannum; 442 feet per annum; a foot a day; 400 feet per annum, and 40 feet\r\nper annum, or _one-tenth_ of the last!\" ... and he adds, \"I was not\r\ntherefore wrong in supposing that the actual progress of a glacier was\r\nyet a new problem when I commenced my observations on the Mer de Glace\r\nin 1842.\"[I]\r\n\r\nIn the 'North British Review' for August, 1859, a writer equally\r\ncelebrated for the brilliancy of his discoveries and the vigour of his\r\npen, collected the data furnished by the above paragraph into a table,\r\nwhich he introduced to his readers in the following words:--\"It is to\r\nProfessor Forbes alone that we owe the first and most correct researches\r\nrespecting the motion of glaciers; and in proof of this, we have only to\r\ngive the following list of observations which had been previously made.\r\n\r\n  Observers.

Such was the state of our knowledge when Professor Forbes undertook\r\nthe investigation of the subject.\"\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that the writer of this article will be the first to\r\napplaud any attempt to remove an error which, advanced on his great\r\nauthority, must necessarily be widely disseminated. The numbers in the\r\nabove table certainly differ widely, and it is perhaps natural to\r\nconclude that such discordant results can be of no value; but the fact\r\nreally is that _every one of them may be perfectly correct_. This fact,\r\nthough overlooked by Professor Forbes, was clearly seen by Rendu, who\r\npointed out with perfect distinctness the sources from which the\r\ndiscrepancies were derived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISCREPANCIES EXPLAINED.]\r\n\r\n\"It is easy,\" he says, \"to comprehend that it is impossible to obtain a\r\ngeneral measure,--that there ought to be one for each particular\r\nglacier. The nature of the slope, the number of changes to which it is\r\nsubjected, the depth of the ice, the width of the couloir, the form of\r\nits sides, and a thousand other circumstances, must produce variations\r\nin the velocity of the glacier, and these circumstances cannot be\r\neverywhere absolutely the same. Much more, it is not easy to obtain this\r\nvelocity for a single glacier, and for this reason. In those portions\r\nwhere the inclination is steep, the layer of ice is thin, and its\r\nvelocity is great; in those where the slope is almost nothing, the\r\nglacier swells and accumulates; the mass in motion being double, triple,\r\n&c., the motion is only the half, the third, &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIQUID MOTION ASCRIBED TO GLACIER.]\r\n\r\n\"But this is not all,\" adds M. Rendu: \"_Between the Mer de Glace and a\r\nriver, there is a resemblance so complete that it is impossible to find\r\nin the latter a circumstance which does not exist in the former._ In\r\ncurrents of water the motion is not uniform, neither throughout their\r\nwidth nor throughout their depth; _the friction of the bottom, that of\r\nthe sides_, the action of obstacles, cause the motion to vary, _and only\r\ntowards the middle of the surface is this entire...._\"[J]\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Professor Forbes appears to have come to the same conclusion as\r\nM. Rendu; for after it had been proved that the centre of the Aar\r\nglacier moved quicker than the side in the ratio of fourteen to one, he\r\naccepted the result in these words:--\"The movement of the centre of the\r\nglacier is to that of a point five metres from the edge as FOURTEEN to\r\nONE: such is the effect of plasticity!\"[K] Indeed, if the differences\r\nexhibited in the table were a proof of error, the observations of\r\nProfessor Forbes himself would fare very ill. The measurements of\r\nglacier-motion made with his own hands vary from less than 42 feet a\r\nyear to 848 feet a year, the minimum being less than _one-twentieth_ of\r\nthe maximum; and if we include the observations made by Balmat, the\r\nfidelity of which has been certified by Professor Forbes, the minimum is\r\nonly _one-thirty-seventh_ of the maximum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NORTH BRITISH REVIEW.]\r\n\r\nThere is another point connected with Rendu's theory which needs\r\nclearing up:--\"The idea,\" writes the eminent reviewer, \"that a glacier\r\nis a semifluid body is no doubt startling, especially to those who have\r\nseen the apparently rigid ice of which it is composed. M. Rendu himself\r\nshrank from the idea, and did not scruple to say that 'the rigidity of a\r\nmass of ice was in direct opposition to it;' and we think that Professor\r\nForbes himself must have stood aghast when his fancy first associated\r\nthe notion of imperfect fluidity with the solid or even the fissured ice\r\nof the glacier, and when he saw in his mind's eye the glaciers of the\r\nAlps flowing like a river along their rugged bed. A truth like this was\r\nabove the comprehension and beyond the sympathy of the age; and it\r\nrequired a moral power of no common intensity to submit it to the ordeal\r\nof a shallow philosophy, and the sneers of a presumptuous criticism.\"\r\n\r\nThese are strong words; but the fact is that, so far from \"shrinking\"\r\nfrom the idea, Rendu affirmed, with a clearness and an emphasis which\r\nhave not been exceeded since, that all the phenomena of a river were\r\nreproduced upon the Mer de Glace; its deeps, its shallows, its\r\nwidenings, its narrowings, its rapids, its places of slow motion, and\r\nthe quicker flow of its centre than of its sides. He did not shrink from\r\naccepting a difference between the central and lateral motion amounting\r\nto a ratio of ten to one--a ratio so large that Professor Forbes at one\r\ntime regarded the acceptance of it as a simple absurdity. In this he was\r\nperhaps justified; for his own first observations, which, however\r\nvaluable, were hasty and incomplete, gave him a maximum ratio of about\r\none and a half to one, while the ratio in some cases was nearly one of\r\n_equality_. The observations of Agassiz however show that the ratio,\r\ninstead of being ten to one, may be _infinity_ to one; for the lateral\r\nice may be so held back by a local obstacle that in the course of a year\r\nit shall make no sensible advance at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ICE AND THE GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nFrom one thing only did M. Rendu shrink; and it is _the_ thing regarding\r\nwhich we are still disunited. He shrank from stating the physical\r\nquality of the ice in virtue of which a glacier moved like a river. He\r\ndemands experiments upon snow and ice to elucidate this subject. The\r\nvery observations which Professor Forbes regards as proofs are those of\r\nwhich we require the physical explanation. It is not the viscous flow,\r\nif you please to call it such, of the glacier as a whole that here\r\nconcerns us; but it is the quality of the _ice_ in virtue of which this\r\nkind of motion is accomplished. Professor Forbes sees this difference\r\nclearly enough: he speaks of \"fissured ice\" being \"flexible\" in hand\r\nspecimens; he compares the glacier to a mixture of ice and sand; and\r\nfinally, in a more matured paper, falls back for an explanation upon the\r\nobservations of Agassiz regarding the capillaries of the glacier.[L]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Expressions such as \"last summer,\" \"last autumn,\" \"recently,\" will\r\nbe taken throughout in the sense which they had in the early half of\r\n1860, when this book was first published.--L.

Pap.,' p. 74.\r\n\r\n[L] In all that has been written upon glaciers in this country the above\r\npassages from the writings of Rendu are unquoted; and many who mingled\r\nvery warmly in the discussions of the subject were, until quite\r\nrecently, ignorant of their existence. I was long in this condition\r\nmyself, for I never supposed that passages which bear so directly upon a\r\npoint so much discussed, and of such cardinal import, could have been\r\noverlooked; or that the task of calling attention to them should devolve\r\nupon myself nearly twenty years after their publication. Now that they\r\nare discovered, I conceive no difference of opinion can exist as to the\r\npropriety of placing them in their true position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(15.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe measurements of Agassiz and Forbes completely verify the\r\nanticipations of Rendu; but no writer with whom I am acquainted has\r\nadded anything essential to the Bishop's statements as to the identity\r\nof glacier and liquid motion. He laid down the conditions of the problem\r\nwith perfect clearness, and, as regards the distribution of merit, the\r\npoint to be decided is the relative importance of his idea, and of the\r\nmeasurements which were subsequently made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OBSERVATIONS OF FORBES.]\r\n\r\nThe observations on which Professor Forbes based the analogy between a\r\nglacier and a river are the following:--In 1842 he fixed four marks upon\r\nthe Mer de Glace a little below the Montanvert, the first of which was\r\n100 yards distant from the side of the glacier, while the last was at\r\nthe centre \"or a little beyond it.\" The relative velocity of these four\r\npoints was found to be\r\n\r\n  1.000     1.332     1.356     1.367.\r\n\r\nThe first observations were made upon two of these points, two others\r\nbeing subsequently added. Professor Forbes also determined the velocity\r\nof two points on the Glacier du Geant, and found the ratio of motion, in\r\nthe first instance, to be as 14 to 32. Subsequent measurements, however,\r\nshowed the ratio to be as 14 to 18, the larger motion belonging to the\r\nstation nearest to the centre of the glacier. These are the only\r\nmeasurements which I can find in his large work that establish the\r\nswifter motion of the centre of the glacier; and in these cases the\r\nvelocity of the centre is compared with that of _one side_ only. In no\r\ninstance that I am aware of, either in 1842 or subsequent years, did\r\nProfessor Forbes extend his measurements quite across a glacier; and as\r\nregards completeness in this respect, no observations hitherto made can\r\nat all compare with those executed at the instance of Agassiz upon the\r\nglacier of the Aar.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Professor Forbes made a series of interesting experiments on a\r\nportion of the Mer de Glace near l'Angle. He divided a length of 90 feet\r\ninto 45 equal spaces, and fixed pins at the end of each. His theodolite\r\nwas placed upon the ice, and in seventeen days he found that the ice 90\r\nfeet nearer the centre than the theodolite had moved 26 inches past the\r\nlatter. These measurements were undertaken for a special object, and\r\ncompletely answered the end for which they were intended.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Professor Forbes made another important observation. Fixing\r\nthree stakes at the heights of 8, 54, and 143 feet above the bed of the\r\nglacier, he found that in five days they moved respectively 2.87, 4.18,\r\nand 4.66 feet. The stake nearest the bed moved most slowly, thus\r\nshowing that the ice is retarded by friction. This result was\r\nsubsequently verified by the measurements of M. Martins, and by my own.\r\n\r\nIf we add to the above an observation made during a short visit to the\r\nAletsch glacier in 1844, which showed its lateral retardation, I believe\r\nwe have before us the whole of the measurements executed by Professor\r\nForbes, which show the analogy between the motion of a glacier and that\r\nof a viscous body.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEASUREMENTS OF AGASSIZ.]\r\n\r\nIllustrative of the same point, we have the elaborate and extensive\r\nseries of measurements executed by M. Wild under the direction of M.\r\nAgassiz upon the glacier of the Aar in 1842, 1843, 1844, and 1845, which\r\nexhibit on a grand scale, and in the most conclusive manner, the\r\ncharacter of the motion of this glacier; and also show, on close\r\nexamination, an analogy with fluid motion which neither M. Agassiz nor\r\nProfessor Forbes suspected. The former philosopher publishes a section\r\nin his 'Systeme Glaciaire,' entitled 'Migrations of the Centre;' in\r\nwhich he shows that the middle of the glacier is not always the point of\r\nswiftest motion. The detection of this fact demonstrates the attention\r\ndevoted by M. Agassiz to the discussion of his observations, but he\r\ngives no clue to the cause of the variation. On inspecting the shape of\r\nthe valley through which the Aar glacier moves, I find that these\r\n\"migrations\" follow the law established in 1857 upon the Mer de Glace,\r\nand enunciated at page 286.\r\n\r\nTo sum up this part of the question:--The _idea_ of semi-fluid motion\r\nbelongs entirely to Rendu; the _proof_ of the quicker central flow\r\nbelongs in part to Rendu, but almost wholly to Agassiz and Forbes; the\r\nproof of the retardation of the bed belongs to Forbes alone; while the\r\ndiscovery of the locus of the point of maximum motion belongs, I\r\nsuppose, to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBES'S THEORY.\r\n\r\n(16.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe formal statement of this theory is given in the following words:--\"A\r\nglacier is an imperfect fluid, or viscous body, which is urged down\r\nslopes of a certain inclination by the mutual pressure of its parts.\"\r\nThe consistency of the glacier is illustrated by reference to treacle,\r\nhoney, and tar, and the theory thus enunciated and exemplified is called\r\nthe 'Viscous Theory.'\r\n\r\nIt has been the subject of much discussion, and great differences of\r\nopinion are still entertained regarding it. Able and sincere men take\r\nopposite sides; and the extraordinary number of Reviews which have\r\nappeared upon the subject during the last two years show the interest\r\nwhich the intellectual public of England take in the question. The chief\r\ndifferences of opinion turn upon the inquiry as to what Professor Forbes\r\nreally meant when he propounded the viscous theory; some affirm one\r\nthing, some another, and, singularly enough, these differences continue,\r\nthough the author of the theory has at various times published\r\nexpositions of his views.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"FACTS AND PRINCIPLES.\"]\r\n\r\nThe differences referred to arise from the circumstances that a\r\nsufficient distinction has not been observed between _facts_ and\r\n_principles_, and that the viscous theory has assumed various forms\r\nsince its first promulgation. It has been stated to me that the theory\r\nof Professor Forbes is \"the congeries of facts\" which he has discovered.\r\nBut it is quite evident that no recognition, however ample, of these\r\nfacts would be altogether satisfactory to Professor Forbes himself. He\r\nclaims recognition of his _theory_,[A] and no writer with whom I am\r\nacquainted makes such frequent use of the term. What then can the\r\nviscous theory mean apart from the facts? I interpret it as furnishing\r\nthe principle from which the facts follow as physical consequences--that\r\nthe glacier moves as a river because the ice is viscous. In this sense\r\nonly can Professor Forbes's views be called a theory; in any other, his\r\nexperiments are mere illustrations of the facts of glacier motion, which\r\ndo not carry us a hair's breadth towards their physical cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VISCOUS THEORY;--WHAT IS IT?]\r\n\r\nWhat then is the meaning of viscosity or viscidity? I have heard it\r\ndefined by men of high culture as \"gluey tenacity;\" and such tenacity\r\nthey once supposed a glacier to possess. If we dip a spoon into treacle,\r\nhoney, or tar, we can draw the substance out into filaments, and the\r\nsame may be done with melted caoutchouc or lava. All these substances\r\nare viscous, and all of them have been chosen to illustrate the physical\r\nproperty in virtue of which a glacier moves. Viscosity then consists in\r\nthe power of being drawn out when subjected to a force of tension, the\r\nsubstance, after stretching, being in a state of molecular equilibrium,\r\nor, in other words, devoid of that elasticity which would restore it to\r\nits original form. This certainly was the idea attached to Professor\r\nForbes's words by some of his most strenuous supporters, and also by\r\neminent men who have never taken part in any controversy on the subject.\r\nMr. Darwin, for example, speaks of felspathic rocks being \"stretched\"\r\nwhile flowing slowly onwards in a pasty condition, in precisely the same\r\nmanner as Professor Forbes believes that the ice of moving glaciers is\r\nstretched and fissured; and Professor Forbes himself quotes these words\r\nof Mr. Darwin as illustrative of his theory.[B]\r\n\r\nThe question now before us is,--Does a glacier exhibit that power of\r\nyielding to a force of tension which would entitle its ice to be\r\nregarded as a viscous substance?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEORY TESTED.]\r\n\r\nWith a view to the solution of this question Mr. Hirst took for me the\r\ninclinations of the Mer de Glace and all its tributaries in 1857; the\r\neffect of a change of inclination being always noted. I will select from\r\nthose measurements a few which bear more specially upon the subject now\r\nunder consideration, commencing with the Glacier des Bois, down which\r\nthe ice moves in that state of wild dislocation already described. The\r\ninclination of the glacier above this cascade is 5 deg. 10', and that of the\r\ncascade itself is 22 deg. 20', the change of inclination being therefore 17 deg.\r\n10'.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Inclinations of ice cascasde of the Glacier des\r\nBois.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 22 I have protracted the inclination of the cascade and of the\r\nglacier above it; the line A B representing the former and B C the\r\nlatter. Now a stream of molten lava, of treacle, or tar, would, in\r\nvirtue of its viscosity, be able to flow over the brow at B without\r\nbreaking across; but this is not the case with the glacier; it is so\r\nsmashed and riven in crossing this brow, that, to use the words of\r\nProfessor Forbes himself, \"it pours into the valley beneath in a cascade\r\nof icy fragments.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INCLINATIONS OF THE MER DE GLACE.]\r\n\r\nBut this reasoning will appear much stronger when we revert to other\r\nslopes upon the Mer de Glace. For example, its inclination above l'Angle\r\nis 4 deg., and it afterwards descends a slope of 9 deg. 25', the change of\r\ninclination being 5 deg. 25'. If we protract these inclinations to scale, we\r\nhave the line A B, Fig. 23, representing the steeper slope, and B C\r\nthat of the glacier above it. One would surely think that a viscous body\r\ncould cross the brow B without transverse fracture, but this the glacier\r\ncannot do, and Professor Forbes himself pronounces this portion of the\r\nMer de Glace impassable. Indeed it was the profound crevasses here\r\nformed which placed me in a difficulty already referred to. Higher up\r\nagain, the glacier is broken on passing from a slope of 3 deg. 10' to one of\r\n5 deg. Such observations show how differently constituted a glacier is from\r\na stream of lava in a \"pasty condition,\" or of treacle, honey, tar, or\r\nmelted caoutchouc, to all which it has been compared. In the next\r\nsection I shall endeavour to explain the origin of the crevasses, and\r\nshall afterwards make a few additional remarks on the alleged viscosity\r\nof ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Inclinations of Mer de Glace above l'Angle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"Mr. Hopkins,\" writes Professor Forbes, \"has done me the honour, in\r\nthe memoirs before alluded to, to mention with approbation my\r\nobservations and experiments on the subject of glaciers. He has been\r\nmore sparing either in praise or criticism of the theory which I have\r\nfounded upon them. Had Mr. Hopkins,\" &c.--_Eighth Letter_; 'Occ.\r\nPapers,' p. 66.\r\n\r\n[B] 'Occ.

They result from the motion of the glacier, and the laws of\r\ntheir formation are deduced immediately from those of the motion. The\r\ncrevasses are sometimes very deep and numerous, and apparently without\r\nlaw or order in their distribution. They cut the ice into long ridges,\r\nand break these ridges transversely into prisms; these prisms gradually\r\nwaste away, assuming, according to the accidents of their melting, the\r\nmost fantastic forms. I have seen them like the mutilated statuary of an\r\nancient temple, like the crescent moon, like huge birds with\r\noutstretched wings, like the claws of lobsters, and like antlered deer.\r\nSuch fantastic sculpture is often to be found on the ice cascades, where\r\nthe riven glacier has piled vast blocks on vaster pedestals, and\r\npresented them to the wasting action of sun and air. In Fig. 24 I have\r\ngiven a sketch of a mass of ice of this character, which stood in 1859\r\non the dislocated slope of the Glacier des Bois.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FANTASTIC ICE-MASSES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Fantastic Mass of ice.]\r\n\r\nIt is usual for visitors to the Montanvert to descend to the glacier,\r\nand to be led by their guides to the edges of the crevasses, where,\r\nbeing firmly held, they look down into them; but those who have only\r\nmade their acquaintance in this way know but little of their magnitude\r\nand beauty in the more disturbed portions of glaciers. As might be\r\nexpected, they have been the graves of many a mountaineer; and the\r\nskeletons found upon the glacier prove that even the chamois itself,\r\nwith its elastic muscles and admirable sureness of foot, is not always\r\nsafe among the crevasses. They are grandest in the higher ice-regions,\r\nwhere the snow hangs like a coping over their edges, and the water\r\ntrickling from these into the gloom forms splendid icicles. The Goerner\r\nGlacier, as we ascend it towards the old Weissthor, presents many fine\r\nexamples of such crevasses; the ice being often torn in a most curious\r\nand irregular manner. You enter a porch, pillared by icicles, and look\r\ninto a cavern in the very body of the glacier, encumbered with vast\r\nfrozen bosses which are fringed all round by dependent icicles. At the\r\nperil of your life from slipping, or from the yielding of the\r\nstalactites, you may enter these caverns, and find yourself steeped in\r\nthe blue illumination of the place. Their beauty is beyond description;\r\nbut you cannot deliver yourself up, heart and soul, to its enjoyment.\r\nThere is a strangeness about the place which repels you, and not without\r\nanxiety do you look from your ledge into the darkness below, through\r\nwhich the sound of subglacial water sometimes rises like the tolling of\r\ndistant bells. You feel that, however the cold splendours of the place\r\nmight suit a purely spiritual essence, they are not congenial to flesh\r\nand blood, and you gladly escape from its magnificence to the sunshine\r\nof the world above.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BIRTH OF A CREVASSE.]\r\n\r\nFrom their numbers it might be inferred that the formation of crevasses\r\nis a thing of frequent occurrence and easy to observe; but in reality it\r\nis very rarely observed. Simond was a man of considerable experience\r\nupon the ice, but the first crevasse he ever saw formed was during the\r\nsetting out of one of our lines, when a narrow rent opened beneath his\r\nfeet, and propagated itself through the ice with loud cracking for a\r\ndistance of 50 or 60 yards. Crevasses always commence in this way as\r\nmere narrow cracks, which open very slowly afterwards. I will here\r\ndescribe the only case of crevasse-forming which has come under my\r\ndirect observation.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of July, 1857, Mr. Hirst and myself, having completed our\r\nday's work, were standing together upon the Glacier du Geant, when a\r\nloud dull sound, like that produced by a heavy blow, seemed to issue\r\nfrom the body of the ice underneath the spot on which we stood. This was\r\nsucceeded by a series of sharp reports, which were heard sometimes above\r\nus, sometimes below us, sometimes apparently close under our feet, the\r\nintervals between the louder reports being filled by a low singing\r\nnoise. We turned hither and thither as the direction of the sounds\r\nvaried; for the glacier was evidently breaking beneath our feet, though\r\nwe could discern no trace of rupture. For an hour the sounds continued\r\nwithout our being able to discover their source; this at length revealed\r\nitself by a rush of air-bubbles from one of the little pools upon the\r\nsurface of the glacier, which was intersected by the newly-formed\r\ncrevasse. We then traced it for some distance up and down, but hardly at\r\nany place was it sufficiently wide to permit the blade of my penknife to\r\nenter it. M. Agassiz has given an animated description of the terror of\r\nhis guides upon a similar occasion, and there was an element of awe in\r\nour own feelings as we heard the evening stillness of the glacier thus\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MECHANICAL ORIGIN.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the mechanical origin of the crevasses the most vague and\r\nuntenable notions had been entertained until Mr. Hopkins published his\r\nextremely valuable papers. To him, indeed, we are almost wholly indebted\r\nfor our present knowledge of the subject, my own experiments upon this\r\nportion of the glacier-question being for the most part illustrations of\r\nthe truth of his reasoning. To understand the fissures in their more\r\ncomplex aspects it is necessary that we should commence with their\r\nelements. I shall deal with the question in my own way, adhering,\r\nhowever, to the mechanical principles upon which Mr. Hopkins has based\r\nhis exposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Diagram explanatory of the mechanical origin of\r\nCrevasses.]\r\n\r\nLet A B, C D, be the bounding sides of a glacier moving in the direction\r\nof the arrow; let _m_, _n_ be two points upon the ice, one, _m_, close\r\nto the retarding side of the valley, and the other, _n_, at some\r\ndistance from it. After a certain time, the point _m_ will have moved\r\ndownwards to _m'_, but in consequence of the swifter movement of the\r\nparts at a distance from the sides, _n_ will have moved in the same\r\ntime to _n'_. Thus the line _m n_, instead of being at right angles to\r\nthe glacier, takes up the oblique position _m' n'_; but to reach from\r\n_m'_ to _n'_ the line _m n_ would have to stretch itself considerably;\r\nevery other line that we can draw upon the ice parallel to _m' n'_ is in\r\na similar state of tension; or, in other words, the sides of the glacier\r\nare acted upon by an oblique pull towards the centre. Now, Mr. Hopkins\r\nhas shown that the direction in which this oblique pull is strongest\r\nencloses an angle of 45 deg. with the side of the glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LINE OF GREATEST STRAIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Diagram showing the line of Greatest Strain.]\r\n\r\nWhat is the consequence of this? Let A B, C D, Fig. 26, represent, as\r\nbefore, the sides of the glacier, moving in the direction of the arrow;\r\nlet the shading lines enclose an angle of 45 deg. with the sides. _Along_\r\nthese lines the marginal ice suffers the greatest strain, and,\r\nconsequently _across_ these lines and at right angles to them, the ice\r\ntends to break and to form _marginal crevasses_. The lines, _o p_, _o\r\np_, mark the direction of these crevasses; they are at right angles to\r\nthe line of greatest strain, and hence also enclose an angle of 45 deg. with\r\nthe side of the valley, _being obliquely pointed upwards_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARGINAL AND TRANSVERSE CREVASSES.]\r\n\r\nThis latter result is noteworthy; it follows from the mechanical data\r\nthat the swifter motion of the centre tends to produce marginal\r\ncrevasses which are inclined from the side of the glacier towards its\r\nsource, and not towards its lower extremity. But when we look down upon\r\na glacier thus crevassed, the first impression is that the sides have\r\nbeen dragged down, and have left the central portions behind them;\r\nindeed, it was this very appearance that led M. de Charpentier and M.\r\nAgassiz into the error of supposing that the sides of a glacier moved\r\nmore quickly than its middle portions; and it was also the delusive\r\naspect of the crevasses which led Professor Forbes to infer the slower\r\nmotion of the eastern side of the Mer de Glace.\r\n\r\nThe retardation of the ice is most evident near the sides; in most\r\ncases, the ice for a considerable distance right and left of the central\r\nline moves with a sensibly uniform velocity; there is no dragging of the\r\nparticles asunder by a difference of motion, and, consequently, a\r\ncompact centre is perfectly compatible with fissured sides. Nothing is\r\nmore common than to see a glacier with its sides deeply cut, and its\r\ncentral portions compact; this, indeed, is always the case where the\r\nglacier moves down a bed of uniform inclination.\r\n\r\nBut supposing that the bed is not uniform--that the valley through which\r\nthe glacier moves changes its inclination abruptly, so as to compel the\r\nice to pass over a brow; the glacier is then circumstanced like a stick\r\nwhich we try to break by holding its two ends and pressing it against\r\nthe knee. The brow, where the bed changes its inclination, represents\r\nthe knee in the case of the stick, while the weight of the glacier\r\nitself is the force that tends to break it. It breaks; and fissures are\r\nformed across the glacier, which are hence called _transverse\r\ncrevasses_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GRINDELWALD GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nNo glacier with which I am acquainted illustrates the mechanical laws\r\njust developed more clearly and fully than the Lower glacier of\r\nGrindelwald. Proceeding along the ordinary track beside the glacier, at\r\nabout an hour's distance from the village the traveller reaches a point\r\nwhence a view of the glacier is obtained from the heights above it. The\r\nmarginal fissures are very cleanly cut, and point nearly in the\r\ndirection already indicated; the glacier also changes its inclination\r\nseveral times along the distance within the observer's view. On crossing\r\neach brow the glacier is broken across, and a series of transverse\r\ncrevasses is formed, which follow each other down the slope. At the\r\nbottom of the slope tension gives place to pressure, the walls of the\r\ncrevasses are squeezed together, and the chasms closed up. They remain\r\nclosed along the comparatively level space which stretches between the\r\nbase of one slope and the brow of the next; but here the glacier is\r\nagain transversely broken, and continues so until the base of the second\r\nslope is reached, where longitudinal pressure instead of longitudinal\r\nstrain begins to act, and the fissures are closed as before. In Fig. 27A\r\nI have given a sketchy section of a portion of the glacier, illustrating\r\nthe formation of the crevasses at the top of a slope, and their\r\nsubsequent obliteration at its base.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMPRESSION AND TENSION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27A, B. Section and Plan of a portion of the Lower\r\nGrindelwald Glacier.]\r\n\r\nAnother effect is here beautifully shown, namely, the union of the\r\ntransverse and marginal crevasses to form continuous fissures which\r\nstretch quite across the glacier. Fig. 27B will illustrate my meaning,\r\nthough very imperfectly; it represents a plan of a portion of the Lower\r\nGrindelwald glacier, with both marginal and transverse fissures drawn\r\nupon it. I have placed it under the section so that each part of it may\r\nshow in plan the portion of the glacier which is shown in section\r\nimmediately above it. It shows how the marginal crevasses remain after\r\nthe compression of the centre has obliterated the transverse ones; and\r\nhow the latter join on to the former, so as to form continuous fissures,\r\nwhich sweep across the glacier in vast curves, with their convexities\r\nturned upwards. The illusion before referred to is here strengthened;\r\nthe crevasses turn, so to say, _against_ the direction of motion,\r\ninstead of forming loops, with their convexities pointing downwards, and\r\nthus would impress a person unacquainted with the mechanical data with\r\nthe idea that the glacier margins moved more quickly than the centre.\r\nThe figures are intended to convey the idea merely; on the actual slopes\r\nof the glacier between twenty and thirty chasms may be counted: also the\r\nword \"compression\" ought to have been limited to the level portions of\r\nthe sketch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONGITUDINAL CREVASSES.]\r\n\r\nBesides the two classes of fissures mentioned we often find others,\r\nwhich are neither marginal nor transverse. The terminal portions of many\r\nglaciers, for example, are in a state of compression; the snout of the\r\nglacier abuts against the ground, and having to bear the thrust of the\r\nmass behind it, if it have room to expand laterally, the ice will\r\nyield, and _longitudinal crevasses_ will be formed. They are of very\r\ncommon occurrence, but the finest example of the kind is perhaps\r\nexhibited by the glacier of the Rhone. After escaping from the steep\r\ngorge which holds the cascade, this glacier encounters the bottom of a\r\ncomparatively wide and level valley; the resistance to its forward\r\nmotion is augmented, while its ability to expand laterally is increased;\r\nit has to bear a longitudinal thrust, and it splits at right angles to\r\nthe pressure [strain?]. A series of fissures is thus formed, the central\r\nones of which are truly longitudinal; but on each side of the central\r\nline the crevasses diverge, and exhibit a fan-like arrangement. This\r\ndisposition of the fissures is beautifully seen from the summit of the\r\nMayenwand on the Grimsel Pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Diagram illustrating the crevassing of Convex\r\nSides of glacier.]\r\n\r\nHere then we have the elements, so to speak, of glacier-crevassing, and\r\nthrough their separate or combined action the most fantastic cutting up\r\nof a glacier may be effected. And see how beautifully these simple\r\nprinciples enable us to account for the remarkable crevassing of the\r\neastern side of the Mer de Glace. Let A B, C D, be the opposite sides of\r\na portion of the glacier, near the Montanvert; C D being east, and A B\r\nwest, the glacier moving in the direction of the arrow; let the points\r\n_m n_ represent the extremities of our line of stakes, and let us\r\nsuppose an elastic string stretched across the glacier from one to the\r\nother. We have proved that the point of maximum motion here lies much\r\nnearer to the side C D than to A B. Let _o_ be this point, and, seizing\r\nthe string at _o_, let it be drawn in the direction of motion until it\r\nassumes the position, _m_, _o'_, _n_. It is quite evident that _o' n_ is\r\nin a state greater tension than _o' m_, and the ice at the eastern side\r\nof the Mer de Glace is in a precisely similar mechanical condition. It\r\nsuffers a greater strain than the ice at the opposite side of the\r\nvalley, and hence is more fissured and broken. Thus we see that the\r\ncrevassing of the eastern side of the glacier is a simple consequence of\r\nthe quicker motion of that side, and does not, as hitherto supposed,\r\ndemonstrate its slower motion. The reason why the eastern side of the\r\nglacier, as a whole, is much more fissured than the western side is,\r\nthat there are two long segments which turn their convex curvature\r\neastward, and only one segment of the glacier which turns its convexity\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CREVASSING OF CONVEX SIDE.]\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of the Rhone glacier sweeps round the side of the\r\nvalley next the Furca, and turns throughout a convex curve to this side:\r\nthe crevasses here are wide and frequent, while they are almost totally\r\nabsent at the opposite side of the glacier. The lower Grindelwald\r\nglacier turns at one place a convex curve towards the Eiger, and is much\r\nmore fissured at that side than at the opposite one; indeed, the\r\nfantastic ice-splinters, columns, and minarets, which are so finely\r\nexhibited upon this glacier, are mainly due to the deep crevassing of\r\nthe convex side. Numerous other illustrations of the law might, I doubt\r\nnot, be discovered, and it would be a pleasant and useful occupation to\r\none who takes an interest in the subject, to determine, by strict\r\nmeasurements upon other glaciers, the locus of the point of maximum\r\nmotion, and to observe the associated mechanical effects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BERGSCHRUNDS.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of crevasses is often determined by circumstances more\r\nlocal and limited than those above indicated; a boss of rock, a\r\nprotuberance on the side of the flanking mountain, anything, in short,\r\nwhich checks the motion of one part of the ice and permits an adjacent\r\nportion to be pushed away from it, produces crevasses. Some valleys are\r\nterminated by a kind of mountain-circus with steep sides, against which\r\nthe snow rises to a considerable height. As the mass is urged downwards,\r\nthe lower portion of the snow-slope is often torn away from its higher\r\nportion, and a chasm is formed, which usually extends round the head of\r\nthe valley. To such a crevasse the specific name _Bergschrund_ is\r\napplied in the Bernese Alps; I have referred to one of them in the\r\naccount of the \"Passage of the Strahleck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(18.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomena described and accounted for in the last chapter have a\r\ndirect bearing upon the question of viscosity. In virtue of the quicker\r\ncentral flow the lateral ice is subject to an oblique strain; but,\r\ninstead of stretching, it breaks, and marginal crevasses are formed. We\r\nalso see that a slight curvature in the valley, by throwing an\r\nadditional strain upon one half of the glacier, produces an augmented\r\ncrevassing of that side.\r\n\r\nBut it is known that a substance confessedly viscous may be broken by a\r\nsudden shock or strain. Professor Forbes justly observes that\r\nsealing-wax at moderate temperatures will mould itself (with time) to\r\nthe most delicate inequalities of the surface on which it rests, but may\r\nat the same time be shivered to atoms by the blow of a hammer. Hence, in\r\norder to estimate the weight of the objection that a glacier breaks when\r\nsubjected to strain, we must know the conditions under which the force\r\nis applied.\r\n\r\nThe Mer de Glace has been shown (p. 287) to move through the neck of the\r\nvalley at Trelaporte at the rate of twenty inches a day. Let the sides\r\nof this page represent the boundaries of the glacier at Trelaporte, and\r\nany one of its lines of print a transverse slice of ice. Supposing the\r\nline to move down the page as the slice of ice moves down the valley,\r\nthen the bending of the ice in twenty-four hours, shown on such a scale,\r\nwould only be sufficient to push forward the centre in advance of the\r\nsides by a very small fraction of the width of the line of print. To\r\nsuch an extremely gradual strain the ice is unable to accommodate itself\r\nwithout fracture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NUMERICAL TEST OF VISCOSITY.]\r\n\r\nOr, referring to actual numbers:--the stake No. 15 on our 5th line, page\r\n284, stood on the lateral moraine of the Mer de Glace; and between it\r\nand No. 14 a distance of 190 feet intervened. Let A B, Fig. 29, be the\r\nside of the glacier, moving in the direction of the arrow, and let _a b\r\nc d_ be a square upon the glacier with a side of 190 feet. The whole\r\nsquare moves with the ice, but the side _b d_ moves quickest; the point\r\n_a_ moving 10 inches, while _b_ moves 14.75 inches in 24 hours; the\r\ndifferential motion therefore amounts to an inch in five hours. Let _a\r\nb' d' c_ be the shape of the figure after five hours' motion; then the\r\nline _a b_ would be extended to _a b'_ and _c d_ to _c d'_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Diagram illustrating test of viscosity.]\r\n\r\nThe extension of _these_ lines does not however express the _maximum_\r\nstrain to which the ice is subjected. Mr. Hopkins has shown that this\r\ntakes place along the line _a d_; in five hours then this line, if\r\ncapable of stretching, would be stretched to _a d'_. From the data given\r\nevery boy who has mastered the 47th Proposition of the First Book of\r\nEuclid can find the length both of _a d_ and _a d'_; the former is\r\n3224.4 inches, and the latter is 3225.1, the difference between them\r\nbeing seven-tenths of an inch.\r\n\r\nThis is the amount of yielding required from the ice in five hours, but\r\nit cannot grant this; the glacier breaks, and numerous marginal\r\ncrevasses are formed. It must not be forgotten that the evidence here\r\nadduced merely shows what ice cannot do; what it _can_ do in the way of\r\nviscous yielding we do not know: there exists as yet no single\r\nexperiment on great masses or small to show that ice possesses in any\r\nsensible degree that power of being drawn out which seems to be the very\r\nessence of viscosity.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the crevasses, on their first formation, are\r\nexceedingly narrow rents, which widen very slowly. The new crevasse\r\nobserved by our guide required several days to attain a width of three\r\ninches; while that observed by Mr. Hirst and myself did not widen a\r\nsingle inch in three days. This, I believe, is the general character of\r\nthe crevasses; they form suddenly and open slowly. Both facts are at\r\nvariance with the idea that ice is viscous; for were this substance\r\ncapable of stretching at the slow rate at which the fissures widen,\r\nthere would be no necessity for their formation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRETCHING OF ICE NOT PROVED.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too clearly and emphatically stated that the _proved_ fact\r\nof a glacier conforming to the law of semi-fluid motion is a thing\r\ntotally different from the _alleged_ fact of its being viscous. Nobody\r\nsince its first enunciation disputed the former. I had no doubt of it\r\nwhen I repaired to the glaciers in 1856; and none of the eminent men who\r\nhave discussed this question with Professor Forbes have thrown any doubt\r\nupon his measurements. It is the assertion that small pieces of ice are\r\nproved to be viscous[A] by the experiments made upon glaciers, and the\r\nconsequent impression left upon the public mind--that ice possesses the\r\n\"gluey tenacity\" which the term viscous suggests--to which these\r\nobservations are meant to apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"The viscosity, though it cannot be traced in the parts _if very\r\nminute_ nevertheless _exists_ there, as unequivocally proved by\r\nexperiments on the large scale.\"--Forbes in 'Phil. Mag.,' vol. x., p.\r\n301.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT AND WORK.\r\n\r\n(19.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONNEXION OF NATURAL FORCES.]\r\n\r\nGreat scientific principles, though usually announced by individuals,\r\nare often merely the distinct expression of thoughts and convictions\r\nwhich had long been entertained by all advanced investigators. Thus the\r\nmore profound philosophic thinkers had long suspected a certain\r\nequivalence and connexion between the various forces of nature;\r\nexperiment had shown the direct connexion and mutual convertibility of\r\nmany of them, and the spiritual insight, which, in the case of the true\r\nexperimenter, always surrounds and often precedes the work of his hands,\r\nrevealed more or less plainly that natural forces either had a common\r\nroot, or that they formed a circle, whose links were so connected that\r\nby starting from any one of them we could go through the circuit, and\r\narrive at the point from which we set out. For the last eighteen years\r\nthis subject has occupied the attention of some of the ablest natural\r\nphilosophers, both in this country and on the Continent. The connexion,\r\nhowever, which has most occupied their minds is that between _heat_ and\r\n_work_; the absolute numerical equivalence of the two having, I believe,\r\nbeen first announced by a German physician named Mayer, and\r\nexperimentally proved in this country by Mr. Joule.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT.]\r\n\r\nA lead bullet may be made hot enough to burn the hand, by striking it\r\nwith a hammer, or by rubbing it against a board; a clever blacksmith can\r\nmake a nail red-hot by hammering it; Count Rumford boiled water by the\r\nheat developed in the boring of cannon, and inferred from the experiment\r\nthat heat was not what it was generally supposed to be, an imponderable\r\nfluid, but a kind of motion generated by the friction. Now Mr. Joule's\r\nexperiments enable us to state the exact amount of heat which a definite\r\nexpenditure of mechanical force can originate. I say _originate_, not\r\ndrag from any hiding-place in which it had concealed itself, but\r\nactually bring into existence, so that the total amount of heat in the\r\nuniverse is thereby augmented. If a mass of iron fall from a tower 770\r\nfeet in height, we can state the precise amount of heat developed by its\r\ncollision with the earth. Supposing all the heat thus generated to be\r\nconcentrated in the iron itself, its temperature would thereby be raised\r\nnearly 10 deg. Fahr. Gravity in this case has expended a certain amount of\r\nforce in pulling the iron to the earth, and this force is the\r\n_mechanical equivalent_ of the heat generated. Furthermore, if we had a\r\nmachine so perfect as to enable us to apply all the heat thus produced\r\nto the raising of a weight, we should be able, by it, to lift the mass\r\nof iron to the precise point from which it fell.\r\n\r\nBut the heat cannot lift the weight and still continue heat; this is the\r\npeculiarity of the modern view of the matter. The heat is consumed, used\r\nup, it is no longer heat; but instead of it we have a certain amount of\r\ngravitating force stored up, which is ready to act again, and to\r\nregenerate the heat when the weight is let loose. In fact, when the\r\nfalling weight is stopped by the earth, the motion of its mass is\r\nconverted into a motion of its molecules; when the weight is lifted by\r\nheat, molecular motion is converted into ordinary mechanical motion, but\r\nfor every portion of either of them brought into existence an equivalent\r\nportion of the other must be consumed.\r\n\r\nWhat is true for masses is also true for atoms. As the earth and the\r\npiece of iron mutually attract each other, and produce heat by their\r\ncollision, so the carbon of a burning candle and the oxygen of the\r\nsurrounding air mutually attract each other; they rush together, and on\r\ncollision the arrested motion becomes heat. In the former case we have\r\nthe conversion of gravity into heat, in the latter the conversion of\r\nchemical affinity into heat; but in each case the process consists in\r\nthe generation of motion by attraction, and the subsequent change of\r\nthat motion into motion of another kind. Mechanically considered, the\r\nattraction of the atoms and its results is precisely the same as the\r\nattraction of the earth and weight and _its_ results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEAT PRODUCED IF THE EARTH STRUCK THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nBut what is true for an atom is also true for a planet or a sun.\r\nSupposing our earth to be brought to rest in her orbit by a sudden\r\nshock, we are able to state the exact amount of heat which would be\r\nthereby generated. The consequence of the earth's being thus brought to\r\nrest would be that it would fall into the sun, and the amount of heat\r\nwhich would be generated by this second collision is also calculable.\r\nHelmholtz has calculated that in the former case the heat generated\r\nwould be equal to that produced by the combustion of fourteen earths of\r\nsolid coal, and in the latter case the amount would be 400 times\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHIFTING OF ATOMS.]\r\n\r\nWhenever a weight is lifted by a steam-engine in opposition to the force\r\nof gravity an amount of heat is consumed equivalent to the work done;\r\nand whenever the molecules of a body are shifted in opposition to their\r\nmutual attractions work is also performed, and an equivalent amount of\r\nheat is consumed. Indeed the amount of work done in the shifting of the\r\nmolecules of a body by heat, when expressed in ordinary mechanical work,\r\nis perfectly enormous. The lifting of a heavy weight to the height of\r\n1000 feet may be as nothing compared with the shifting of the atoms of a\r\nbody by an amount so small that our finest means of measurement hardly\r\nenable us to determine it. Different bodies give heat different degrees\r\nof trouble, if I may use the term, in shifting their atoms and putting\r\nthem in new places. Iron gives more trouble than lead; and water gives\r\nfar more trouble than either. The heat expended in this molecular work\r\nis lost as heat; it does not show itself as temperature. Suppose the\r\nheat produced by the combustion of an ounce of candle to be concentrated\r\nin a pound of iron, a certain portion of that heat would go to perform\r\nthe molecular work to which I have referred, and the remainder would be\r\nexpended in raising the temperature of the body; and if the same amount\r\nof heat were communicated to a pound of iron and to a pound of lead, the\r\nbalance in favour of temperature would be greater in the latter case\r\nthan in the former, because the heat would have less molecular work to\r\ndo; the lead would become more heated than the iron. To raise a pound of\r\niron a certain number of degrees in temperature would, in fact, require\r\nmore than three times the absolute quantity of heat which would be\r\nrequired to raise a pound of lead the same number of degrees.\r\nConversely, if we place the pound of iron and the pound of lead, heated\r\nto the same temperature, into ice, we shall find that the quantity of\r\nice melted by the iron will be more than three times that melted by the\r\nlead. In fact, the greater amount of molecular work invested in the iron\r\nnow comes into play, the atoms again obey their own powerful forces, and\r\nan amount of heat corresponding to the energy of these forces is\r\ngenerated.\r\n\r\nThis molecular work is that which has usually been called _specific\r\nheat_, or _capacity for heat_. According to the _materialistic_ view of\r\nheat, bodies are figured as sponges, and heat as a kind of fluid\r\nabsorbed by them, different bodies possessing different powers of\r\nabsorption. According to the _dynamic_ view, as already explained, heat\r\nis regarded as a motion, and capacity for heat indicates the quantity of\r\nthat motion consumed in internal changes.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of these changes occurs when a body passes from one state\r\nof aggregation to another, from the solid to the liquid, or from the\r\nliquid to the aeriform state; and the quantity of heat required for such\r\nchanges is often enormous. To convert a pound of ice at 32 deg. Fahr. into\r\nwater _at the same temperature_ would require an amount of heat\r\ncompetent, if applied as mechanical force, to lift the same pound of ice\r\nto a height of 110,000 feet; it would raise a ton of ice nearly 50 feet,\r\nor it would lift between 49 and 50 tons to a height of one foot above\r\nthe earth's surface. To convert a pound of water at 212 deg. into a pound of\r\nsteam at the same temperature would require an amount of heat which\r\nwould perform nearly seven times the amount of mechanical work just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEAT CONSUMED IN MOLECULAR WORK.]\r\n\r\nThis heat is entirely expended in _interior work_,[A] and does nothing\r\ntowards augmenting the temperature; the water is at the temperature of\r\nthe ice which produced it, both are 32 deg.; and the steam is at the\r\ntemperature of the water which produced it, both are 212 deg. The whole of\r\nthe heat is consumed in producing the change of aggregation; I say\r\n\"_consumed_,\" not hidden or \"latent\" in either the water or the steam,\r\nbut absolutely non-existent as heat. The molecular forces, however,\r\nwhich the heat has sacrificed itself to overcome are able to reproduce\r\nit; the water in freezing and the steam in condensing give out the exact\r\namount of heat which they consumed when the change of aggregation was in\r\nthe opposite direction.\r\n\r\nAt a temperature of several degrees below its freezing point ice is much\r\nharder than at 32 deg. I have more than once cooled a sphere of the\r\nsubstance in a bath of solid carbonic acid and ether to a temperature of\r\n100 deg. below the freezing point. During the time of cooling the ice\r\ncrackled audibly from its contraction, and afterwards it quite resisted\r\nthe edge of a knife; while at 32 deg. it may be cut or crushed with extreme\r\nfacility. The cold sphere was subjected to pressure; it broke with the\r\ndetonation of a vitreous body, and was taken from the press a white\r\nopaque powder; which, on being subsequently raised to 32 deg. and again\r\ncompressed, was converted into a pellucid slab of ice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ICE NEAR THE MELTING POINT.]\r\n\r\nBut before the temperature of 32 deg. is quite attained, ice gives evidence\r\nof a loosening of its crystalline texture. Indeed the unsoundness of ice\r\nat and near its melting point has been long known. Sir John Leslie, for\r\nexample, states that ice at 32 deg. is _friable_; and every skater knows how\r\nrotten ice becomes before it thaws. M. Person has further shown that the\r\nlatent heat of ice, that is to say, the quantity of heat necessary for\r\nits liquefaction, is not quite expressed by the quantity consumed in\r\nreducing ice at 32 deg. to the liquid state. The heat begins to be rendered\r\nlatent, or in other words the change of aggregation commences, a little\r\nbefore the substance reaches 32 deg.,--a conclusion which is illustrated and\r\nconfirmed by the deportment of melting ice under pressure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROTTEN ICE AND SOFTENED WAX.]\r\n\r\nIn reference to the above result Professor Forbes writes as follows:--\"I\r\nhave now to refer to a fact ... established by a French experimenter, M.\r\nPerson, who appears not to have had even remotely in his mind the theory\r\nof glaciers, when he announced the following facts, viz.--'That ice does\r\nnot pass abruptly from the solid to the fluid state; that it begins to\r\n_soften_ at a temperature of 2 deg. Centigrade below its thawing point;\r\nthat, consequently, between 28 deg. 4' and 32 deg. of Fahr. ice is actually\r\npassing through various degrees of plasticity within narrower limits,\r\nbut in the same manner that wax, for example, softens before it melts.'\"\r\nThe \"_softening_\" here referred to is the \"friability,\" of Sir J.\r\nLeslie, and what I have called a \"loosening of the texture.\" Let us\r\nsuppose the Serpentine covered by a sheet of pitch so smooth and hard as\r\nto enable a skater to glide over it; and which is afterwards gradually\r\nwarmed until it begins to bend under his weight, and finally lets him\r\nthrough. A comparison of this deportment with that of a sheet of ice\r\nunder the same circumstances enables us to decide whether ice \"passes\r\nthrough various degrees of plasticity in the same manner as wax softens\r\nbefore it melts.\" M. Person concerned himself solely with the heat\r\nabsorbed, and no doubt in both wax and ice that heat is expended in\r\n\"interior work.\" In the one case, however, the body is so constituted\r\nthat the absorbed heat is expended in rendering the substance viscous;\r\nand the question simply is, whether the heat absorbed by the ice gives\r\nits molecules a freedom of play which would entitle it also to be called\r\nviscous; whether, in short, \"rotten ice\" and softened wax present the\r\nsame physical qualities?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] I borrow this term from Professor Clausius's excellent papers on the\r\nDynamical Theory of Heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(20.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one other point in connexion with the viscous theory which\r\nclaims our attention. The announcement of that theory startled\r\nscientific men, and for two or three years after its first publication\r\nit formed the subject of keen discussion. This finally subsided, and\r\nafterwards Professor Forbes drew up an elaborate paper, which was\r\npresented in three parts to the Royal Society in 1845 and 1846, and\r\nsubsequently published in the 'Philosophical Transactions.'\r\n\r\nIn the concluding portion of Part III. Professor Forbes states and\r\nanswers the question, \"How far a glacier is to be regarded as a plastic\r\nmass?\" in these words:--\"Were a glacier composed of a solid crystalline\r\ncake of ice, fitted or moulded to the mountain bed which it occupies,\r\nlike a lake tranquilly frozen, it would seem impossible to admit such a\r\nflexibility or yielding of parts as should permit any comparison to a\r\nfluid or semifluid body, transmitting pressure horizontally, and whose\r\nparts might change their mutual positions so that one part should be\r\npushed out whilst another remained behind. But we know, in point of\r\nfact, that a glacier is a body very differently constituted. It is\r\nclearly proved by the experiments of Agassiz and others that the glacier\r\nis not a mass of ice, but of ice and water, the latter percolating\r\nfreely through the crevices of the former to all depths of the glacier;\r\nand it is a matter of ocular demonstration that these crevices, though\r\nvery minute, communicate freely with one another to great distances; the\r\nwater with which they are filled communicates force also to great\r\ndistances, and exercises a tremendous hydrostatic pressure to move\r\nonwards in the direction in which gravity urges it, the vast porous mass\r\nof seemingly rigid ice in which it is as it were bound up.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAPILLARY HYPOTHESIS.]\r\n\r\n\"Now the water in the crevices,\" continues Professor Forbes, \"does not\r\nconstitute the glacier, but only the principal vehicle of the force\r\nwhich acts on it, and the slow irresistible energy with which the icy\r\nmass moves onwards from hour to hour with a continuous march, bespeaks\r\nof itself the presence of a fluid pressure. But if the ice were not in\r\nsome degree ductile or plastic, this pressure could never produce any\r\nthe least forward motion of the mass. The pressure in the capillaries of\r\nthe glacier can only tend to separate one particle from another, and\r\nthus produce tensions and compressions _within the body of the glacier\r\nitself_, which yields, owing to its slightly ductile nature, in the\r\ndirection of least resistance, retaining its continuity, or recovering\r\nit by reattachment after its parts have suffered a bruise, according to\r\nthe violence of the action to which it has been exposed.\"\r\n\r\nI will not pretend to say that I fully understand this passage, but,\r\ntaking it and the former one together, I think it is clear that the\r\nwater which is supposed to gorge the capillaries of the glacier is\r\nassumed to be essential to its motion. Indeed, an extreme degree of\r\nsensitiveness has been ascribed to the glacier as regards the changes of\r\ntemperature by which the capillaries are affected. In three succeeding\r\ndays, for example, Professor Forbes found the diurnal summer motion of a\r\npoint upon the Mer de Glace to increase from 15.2 to 17.5 inches a day;\r\na result which he says he is \"persuaded\" to be due to the increasing\r\nheat of the weather at the time. If, then, the glacier capillaries can\r\nbe gorged so quickly as this experiment would indicate, it is fair to\r\nassume that they are emptied with corresponding speed when the supply is\r\ncut away.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TEMPERATURE AT CHAMOUNI; WINTER 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary coldness of the weather previous to the Christmas of\r\n1859 is in the recollection of everybody: this lowness of temperature\r\nalso extended to the Mer de Glace and its environs. I had last summer\r\nleft with Auguste Balmat and the Abbe Vueillet thermometers with which\r\nobservations were made daily during the cold weather referred to. I take\r\nthe following from Balmat's register.\r\n\r\n                   Minimum\r\n  Date.            temperature\r\n                   Centigrade.\r\n  December 16         -15 deg.\r\n       \"   17         -20\r\n       \"   18         -16-1/2\r\n       \"   19          -9\r\n       \"   20         -13\r\n       \"   21         -20-1/2\r\n       \"   22          -4-1/4\r\n  December 23          -4-1/2 deg.\r\n       \"   24          -6-1/2\r\n       \"   25          -2\r\n       \"   26          +2\r\n       \"   27          -3\r\n       \"   28         -10-1/2\r\n       \"   29          -6\r\n\r\nThe temperature at the Montanvert during the above period may be assumed\r\nas generally some degrees lower, so that for a considerable period,\r\nprevious to my winter observations, the portion of the Mer de Glace near\r\nthe Montanvert had been exposed to a very low temperature. I reached\r\nthe place after the weather had become warm, but during my stay there\r\nthe maximum temperature did not exceed -4-1/2 deg. C. Considering therefore\r\nthe long drain to which the glacier had been subjected previous to the\r\n29th of December, it is not unreasonable to infer that the capillary\r\nsupply assumed by Professor Forbes must by that time have been\r\nexhausted. Notwithstanding this, the motion of the glacier at the\r\nMontanvert amounted at the end of December to half its maximum summer\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BALMAT'S MEASUREMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe observations of Balmat which have been published by Professor\r\nForbes[A] also militate, as far as they go, against the idea of\r\nproportionality between the capillary supply and the motion. If the\r\ntemperatures recorded apply to the Mer de Glace during the periods of\r\nobservation, it would follow that from the 19th of December 1846 to the\r\n12th of April 1847 the temperature of the air was constantly under zero\r\nCentigrade, and hence, during this time, the gorging of the capillaries,\r\nwhich is due to superficial melting, must have ceased. Still, throughout\r\nthis entire period of depletion the motion of the glacier steadily\r\nincreased from twenty-four inches to thirty-four and a half inches a\r\nday. What has been here said of the Montanvert, and of the points lower\r\ndown where Balmat's measurements were made, of course applies with\r\ngreater force to the higher portions of the glacier, which are withdrawn\r\nfrom the operation of superficial melting for a longer period, and\r\nwhich, nevertheless, if I understand Professor Forbes aright, have their\r\nmotion _least affected_ in winter. He records, for example, an\r\nobservation of Mr. Bakewell's, by which the Glacier des Bossons is shown\r\nto be stationary at its end, while its upper portions are moving at the\r\nrate of a foot a day. This surely indicates that, at those places where\r\nthe glacier is longest cut off from superficial supply, the motion is\r\nleast reduced, which would be a most strange result if the motion\r\ndepended, as affirmed, upon the gorging of the capillaries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BAKEWELL'S OBSERVATIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe perusal of the conclusion of Professor Forbes's last volume shows me\r\nthat a thought similar to that expressed above occurred to Mr. Bakewell\r\nalso. Speaking of a shallow glacier which moved when the alleged\r\ntemperature was so enormously below the freezing point that Professor\r\nForbes regards the observation as open to question (in which I agree\r\nwith him), Mr. Bakewell asks, \"Is it possible that infiltrated water can\r\nhave any action whatever under such circumstances?\" The reply of\r\nProfessor Forbes contains these words:--\"I have nowhere affirmed the\r\npresence of liquid water to be a _sine qua non_ to the plastic motion of\r\nglaciers.\" This statement, I confess, took me by surprise, which was not\r\ndiminished by further reading. Speaking of the influence of temperature\r\non the motion of the Mer de Glace, Professor Forbes says, the glacier\r\n\"took no real start until the frost had given way, and the tumultuous\r\ncourse of the Arveiron showed that its veins were again filled with the\r\ncirculating medium to which the glacier, like the organic frame, owes\r\nits moving energy.\"[B] And again:--\"It is this fragility precisely\r\nwhich, yielding to the hydrostatic pressure of the unfrozen water\r\ncontained in the countless capillaries of the glacier, produces the\r\ncrushing action which shoves the ice over its neighbour particles.\"[C]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HUXLEY'S OBSERVATIONS.]\r\n\r\nAfter the perusal of the foregoing paragraphs the reader will probably\r\nbe less interested in the question as to whether the assumed capillaries\r\nexist at all in the glacier. According to Mr. Huxley's observations,\r\nthey do not.[D] During the summer of 1857 he carefully experimented with\r\ncoloured liquids on the Mer de Glace and its tributaries, and in no case\r\nwas he able to discover these fissures in the sound unweathered ice. I\r\nhave myself seen the red liquid resting in an auger-hole, where it had\r\nlain for an hour without diffusing itself in any sensible degree. This\r\ncavity intersected both the white ice and the blue veins of the glacier;\r\nand Mr. Huxley, in my presence, cut away the ice until the walls of the\r\ncavity became extremely thin, still no trace of liquid passed through\r\nthem. Experiments were also made upon the higher portions of the Mer de\r\nGlace, and also on the Glacier du Geant, with the same result. Thus the\r\nvery existence of these capillaries is rendered so questionable, that no\r\ntheory of glacier-motion which invokes their aid could be considered\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] 'Occ.

He inferred that the lowering of the freezing point for\r\nevery atmosphere of pressure amounted to .0075 of a degree Centigrade.\r\nThis deduction was afterwards submitted to the test of experiment by his\r\ndistinguished brother Prof. Wm. Thomson, and proved correct. On the fact\r\nthus established is founded Mr. James Thomson's theory of the\r\n\"Plasticity of Ice as manifested in Glaciers.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STATEMENT OF THEORY.]\r\n\r\nThe theory is this:--Certain portions of the glacier are supposed first\r\nto be subjected to pressure. This pressure liquefies the ice, the water\r\nthus produced being squeezed through the glacier in the direction in\r\nwhich it can most easily escape. But cold has been evolved by the act of\r\nliquefaction, and, when the water has been relieved from the pressure,\r\nit freezes in a new position. The pressure being thus abolished at the\r\nplace where it was first applied, new portions of the ice are subjected\r\nto the force; these in their turn liquefy, the water is dispersed as\r\nbefore, and re-frozen in some other place. To the succession of\r\nprocesses here assumed Mr. Thomson ascribes the changes of form observed\r\nin glaciers.\r\n\r\nThis theory was first communicated to the Royal Society through the\r\nauthor's brother, Prof. William Thomson, and is printed in the\r\n'Proceedings' of the Society for May, 1857. It was afterwards\r\ncommunicated to the British Association in Dublin, in whose 'Reports'\r\nit is further published; and again it was communicated to the Belfast\r\nLiterary and Philosophical Society, in whose 'Proceedings' it also finds\r\na place.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of November, 1859, Mr. James Thomson communicated to the\r\nRoyal Society, through his brother, a second paper, in which he again\r\ndraws attention to his theory. He offers it in substitution for my views\r\nas the best argument that he can adduce against them; he also\r\ncontroverts the explanations of regelation propounded by Prof. James D.\r\nForbes and Prof. Faraday, believing that his own theory explains all the\r\nfacts so well as to leave room for no other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFICULTIES OF THEORY.]\r\n\r\nBut the passage in this paper which demands my chief attention is the\r\nfollowing:--\"Prof. Tyndall (writes Mr. Thomson), in papers and lectures\r\nsubsequent to the publication of this theory, appears to adopt it to\r\nsome extent, and to endeavour to make its principles co-operate with the\r\nviews he had previously founded on Mr. Faraday's fact of regelation.\" I\r\nmay say that Mr. Thomson's main thought was familiar to me long before\r\nhis first communication on the plasticity of ice appeared; but it had\r\nlittle influence upon my convictions. Were the above passage correct, I\r\nshould deserve censure for neglecting to express my obligations far more\r\nexplicitly than I have hitherto done; but I confess that even now I do\r\nnot understand the essential point of Mr. Thomson's theory,--that is to\r\nsay, its application to the phenomena of glacier motion. Indeed, it was\r\nthe obscurity in my mind in connexion with this point, and the hope that\r\ntime might enable me to seize more clearly upon his meaning, which\r\nprevented me from giving that prominence to the theory of Mr. Thomson\r\nwhich, for aught I know, it may well deserve. I will here briefly state\r\none or two of my difficulties, and shall feel very grateful to have them\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IMPROBABLE DEDUCTION.]\r\n\r\nLet us fix our attention on a vertical slice of ice transverse to the\r\nglacier, and to which the pressure is applied perpendicular to its\r\nsurfaces. The ice liquefies, and, supposing the means of escape offered\r\nto the compressed water to be equal all round, it is plain that there\r\nwill be as great a tendency to squeeze the water upwards as downwards;\r\nfor the mere tendency to flow down by its own gravity becomes, in\r\ncomparison to the forces here acting on the water, a vanishing quantity.\r\nBut the fact is, that the ice above the slice is more permeable than\r\nthat below it; for, as we descend a glacier, the ice becomes more\r\ncompact. Hence the greater part of the dispersed water will be refrozen\r\non that side of the slice which is turned towards the origin of the\r\nglacier; and the consequence is, that, according to Mr. Thomson's\r\nprinciple, the glacier ought to move up hill instead of down.\r\n\r\nI would invite Mr. Thomson to imagine himself and me together upon the\r\nice, desirous of examining this question in a philosophic spirit; and\r\nthat we have taken our places beside a stake driven into the ice, and\r\ndescending with the glacier. We watch the ice surrounding the stake, and\r\nfind that every speck of dirt upon it retains its position; there is no\r\nliquefaction of the ice that bears the dirt, and consequently it rests\r\non the glacier undisturbed. After twelve hours we find the stake fifteen\r\ninches distant from its first position: I would ask Mr. Thomson how did\r\nit get there? Or let us fix our attention on those six stakes which M.\r\nAgassiz drove into the glacier of the Aar in 1841, and found erect in\r\n1842 at some hundreds of feet from their first position:--how did they\r\nget there? How, in fine, does the end of a glacier become its end? Has\r\nit been liquefied and re-frozen? If not, it must have been _pushed_ down\r\nby the very forces which Mr. Thomson invokes to produce his\r\nliquefaction. Both the liquefaction, as far as it exists, and the\r\nmotion, are products of the same cause. In short, this theory, as it\r\npresents itself to my mind, is so powerless to account for the simplest\r\nfact of glacier-motion, that I feel disposed to continue to doubt my own\r\ncompetence to understand it rather than ascribe to Mr. Thomson an\r\nhypothesis apparently so irrelevant to the facts which it professes to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty is the following:--Mr. Thomson will have seen that I\r\nhave recorded certain winter measurements made on the Mer de Glace, and\r\nthat these measurements show not only that the ice moves at that period\r\nof the year, but that it exhibits those characteristics of motion from\r\nwhich its plasticity has been inferred; the velocity of the central\r\nportions of the glacier being in round numbers double the velocity of\r\nthose near the sides. Had there been any necessity for it, this ratio\r\nmight have been augmented by placing the side-stakes closer to the walls\r\nof the glacier. Considering the extreme coldness of the weather which\r\npreceded these measurements, it is a moderate estimate to set down the\r\ntemperature of the ice in which my stakes were fixed at 5 deg. Cent. below\r\nzero.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REQUISITE PRESSURE CALCULATED.]\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to estimate the pressure existing at the portion of\r\nthe glacier where these measurements were made. The height of the\r\nMontanvert above the sea-level is, according to Prof. Forbes, 6300 feet;\r\nthat of the Col du Geant, which is the summit of the principal tributary\r\nof the Mer de Glace, is 11,146 feet: deducting the former from the\r\nlatter, we find the height of the Col du Geant above the Montanvert to\r\nbe 4846 feet.\r\n\r\nNow, according to Mr. Thomson's theory and his brother's experiments,\r\nthe melting point of ice is lowered .0075 deg. Centigrade for every\r\natmosphere of pressure; and one atmosphere being equivalent to the\r\npressure of about thirty-three feet of water, we shall not be over the\r\ntruth if we take the height of an equivalent column of glacier-ice, of a\r\ncompactness the mean of those which it exhibits upon the Col du Geant\r\nand at the Montanvert respectively, at forty feet. The compactness of\r\nglacier ice is, of course, affected by the air-bubbles contained within\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ACTUAL PRESSURE INSUFFICIENT.]\r\n\r\nIf, then, the pressure of forty feet of ice lower the melting point\r\n.0075 deg. Centigrade, it follows that the pressure of a column 4846 feet\r\nhigh will lower it nine-tenths of a degree Centigrade. Supposing, then,\r\nthe _unimpeded thrust of the whole glacier, from the Col du Geant\r\ndownwards_, to be exerted on the ice at the Montanvert; or, in other\r\nwords, supposing the bed of the glacier to be absolutely smooth and\r\nevery trace of friction abolished, the utmost the pressure thus obtained\r\ncould perform would be to lower the melting point of the Montanvert ice\r\nby the quantity above mentioned. Taking into account the actual state of\r\nthings, the friction of the glacier against its sides and bed, the\r\nopposition which the three tributaries encounter in the neck of the\r\nvalley at Trelaporte, the resistance encountered in the sinuous valley\r\nthrough which it passes; and finally, bearing in mind the comparatively\r\nshort length of the glacier, which has to bear the thrust, and oppose\r\nthe latter by its own friction merely;--I think it will appear evident\r\nthat the ice at the Montanvert cannot possibly have its melting point\r\nlowered by pressure more than a small fraction of a degree.\r\n\r\nThe ice in which my stakes were fixed being -5 deg. Centigrade, according to\r\nMr. Thomson's calculation and his brother's experiments, it would\r\nrequire 667 atmospheres of pressure to liquefy it; in other words, it\r\nwould require the unimpeded pressure of a column of glacier-ice 26,680\r\nfeet high. Did Mont Blanc rise to two and a half times its present\r\nheight above the Montanvert, and were the latter place connected with\r\nthe summit of the mountain by a continuous glacier with its bed\r\nabsolutely smooth, the pressure at the Montanvert would be rather under\r\nthat necessary to liquefy the ice on which my winter observations were\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEASUREMENTS APPLY TO SURFACE.]\r\n\r\nIf it be urged that, though the temperature near the surface may be\r\nseveral degrees below the freezing point, the great body of the glacier\r\ndoes not share this temperature, but is, in all probability, near to\r\n32 deg., my reply is simple. I did not measure the motion of the ice in the\r\nbody of the glacier; nobody ever did; my measurements refer to the ice\r\nat and near the surface, and it is this ice which showed the plastic\r\ndeportment which the measurements reveal.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are some of the considerations which prevent me from\r\naccepting the theory of Mr. Thomson, and I trust they will acquit me of\r\nall desire, to make his theory co-operate with my views. I am, however,\r\nfar from considering his deduction the less important because of its\r\nfailing to account for the phenomena of glacier motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESSURE-THEORY OF GLACIER-MOTION.\r\n\r\n(22.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POSSIBLE MOULDING OF ICE.]\r\n\r\nBroadly considered, two classes of facts are presented to the\r\nglacier-observer; the one suggestive of viscosity, and the other of the\r\nreverse. The former are seen where _pressure_ comes into play, the\r\nlatter where _tension_ is operative. By pressure ice can be moulded to\r\nany shape, while the same ice snaps sharply asunder if subjected to\r\ntension. Were the result worth the labour, ice might be moulded into\r\nvases or statuettes, bent into spiral bars, and, I doubt not, by the\r\nproper application of pressure, a _rope_ of ice might be formed and\r\ncoiled into a _knot_. But not one of these experiments, though they\r\nmight be a thousandfold more striking than any ever made upon a glacier,\r\nwould in the least demonstrate that ice is really a viscous body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Moulds used in experiments with ice.]\r\n\r\nI have here stated what I believe to be feasible. Let me now refer to\r\nthe experiments which have been actually made in illustration of this\r\npoint. Two pieces of seasoned box-wood had corresponding cavities\r\nhollowed in them, so that, when one was placed upon the other, a\r\nlenticular space was enclosed. A and B, Fig. 30, represent the pieces\r\nof box-wood with the cavities in plan: C represents their section when\r\nthey are placed upon each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ACTUAL MOULDING OF ICE.]\r\n\r\nA _sphere_ of ice rather more than sufficient to fill the lenticular\r\nspace was placed between the pieces of wood and subjected to the action\r\nof a small hydraulic press. The ice was crushed, but the crushed\r\nfragments soon reattached themselves, and, in a few seconds, a lens of\r\ncompact ice was taken from the mould.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Moulds used in experiments with ice.]\r\n\r\nThis lens was placed in a cylindrical cavity hollowed out in another\r\npiece of box-wood, and represented at C, Fig. 31; and a flat piece of\r\nthe wood was placed over the lens as a cover, as at D. On subjecting the\r\nwhole to pressure, the lens broke, as the sphere had done, but the\r\ncrushed mass soon re-established its continuity, and in less than half a\r\nminute a compact cake of ice was taken from the mould.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Moulds used in experiments with ice.]\r\n\r\nIn the following experiment the ice was subjected to a still severer\r\ntest:--A hemispherical cavity was formed in one block of box-wood, and\r\nupon a second block a hemispherical protuberance was turned, smaller\r\nthan the cavity, so that, when the latter was placed in the former, a\r\nspace of a quarter of an inch existed between the two. Fig. 32\r\nrepresents a section of the two pieces of box-wood; the brass pins _a_,\r\n_b_, fixed in the slab G H, and entering suitable apertures in the mould\r\nI K, being intended to keep the two surfaces concentric. A lump of ice\r\nbeing placed in the cavity, the protuberance was brought down upon it,\r\nand the mould subjected to hydraulic pressure: after a short interval\r\nthe ice was taken from the mould as a smooth compact _cup_, its crushed\r\nparticles having reunited, and established their continuity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ICE MOULDED TO CUPS AND RINGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. Moulds used in experiments with ice.]\r\n\r\nTo make these results more applicable to the bending of glacier-ice, the\r\nfollowing experiments were made:--A block of box-wood, M, Fig. 33, 4\r\ninches long, 3 wide, and 3 deep, had its upper surface slightly curved,\r\nand a groove an inch wide, and about an inch deep, worked into it. A\r\ncorresponding plate was prepared, having its under surface part of a\r\nconvex cylinder, of the same curvature as the concave surface of the\r\nformer piece. When the one slab was placed upon the other, they\r\npresented the appearance represented in section at N. A straight prism\r\nof ice 4 inches long, an inch wide, and a little more than an inch in\r\ndepth, was placed in the groove; the upper slab was placed upon it, and\r\nthe whole was subjected to the hydraulic press. The prism broke, but,\r\nthe quantity of ice being rather more than sufficient to fill the\r\ngroove, the pressure soon brought the fragments together and\r\nre-established the continuity of the ice. After a few seconds it was\r\ntaken from the mould a bent bar of ice. This bar was afterwards passed\r\nthrough three other moulds of gradually augmenting curvature, and was\r\ntaken from the last of them a _semi-ring_ of compact ice.\r\n\r\nThe ice, in changing its form from that of one mould to that of another,\r\nwas in every instance broken and crushed by the pressure; but suppose\r\nthat instead of three moulds three thousand had been used; or, better\r\nstill, suppose the curvature of a single mould to change by extremely\r\nslow degrees; the ice would then so gradually change its form that no\r\nrude rupture would be apparent. Practically the ice would behave as a\r\n_plastic_ substance; and indeed this plasticity has been contended for\r\nby M. Agassiz, in opposition to the idea of viscosity. As already\r\nstated, the ice, bruised, and flattened, and bent in the above\r\nexperiments, was incapable of being sensibly stretched; it was plastic\r\nto pressure but not to tension.\r\n\r\nA quantity of water was always squeezed out of the crushed ice in the\r\nabove experiments, and the bruised fragments were intermixed with this\r\nand with air. Minute quantities of both remained in the moulded ice, and\r\nthus rendered it in some degree turbid. Its character, however, as to\r\ncontinuity may be inferred from the fact that the ice-cup, moulded as\r\ndescribed, held water without the slightest visible leakage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOFTNESS OF ICE DEFINED.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRESSURE AND TENSION.]\r\n\r\nIce at 32 deg. may, as already stated, be crushed with extreme facility, and\r\nglacier-ice with still more readiness than lake-ice: it may also be\r\nscraped with a knife with even greater facility than some kinds of\r\nchalk. In comparison with ice at 100 deg. below the freezing point, it might\r\nbe popularly called _soft_. But its softness is not that of paste, or\r\nwax, or treacle, or lava, or honey, or tar. It is the softness of\r\ncalcareous spar in comparison with that of rock-crystal; and although\r\nthe latter is incomparably harder than the former, I think it will be\r\nconceded that the term viscous would be equally inapplicable to both. My\r\nobject here is clearly to define terms, and not permit physical error to\r\nlurk beneath them. How far this ice, with a softness thus defined, when\r\nsubjected to the gradual pressures exerted in a glacier, is bruised and\r\nbroken, and how far the motion of its parts may approach to that of a\r\ntruly viscous body under pressure, I do not know. The critical point\r\nhere is that the ice changes its form, and preserves its continuity,\r\nduring its motion, in virtue of _external_ force. It remains continuous\r\nwhilst it moves, because its particles are kept in juxtaposition by\r\npressure, and when this external prop is removed, and the ice, subjected\r\nto tension, has to depend solely upon the mobility of its own particles\r\nto preserve its continuity, the analogy with a viscous body instantly\r\nbreaks down.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"Imagine,\" writes Professor Forbes, \"a long narrow trough or canal,\r\nstopped at both ends and filled to a considerable depth with treacle,\r\nhoney, tar, or any such viscid fluid. Imagine one end of the trough to\r\ngive way, the bottom still remaining horizontal: if the friction of the\r\nfluid against the bottom be greater than the friction against its own\r\nparticles, the upper strata will roll over the lower ones, and protrude\r\nin a convex slope, which will be propagated backwards towards the other\r\nor closed end of the trough. Had the matter been quite fluid the whole\r\nwould have run out, and spread itself on a level: as it is, it assumes\r\nprecisely the conditions which we suppose to exist in a glacier.\" This\r\nis perfectly definite, and my equally definite opinion is that no\r\nglacier ever exhibited the mechanical effects implied by this\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGELATION.\r\n\r\n(23.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FARADAY'S FIRST EXPERIMENT.]\r\n\r\nI was led to the foregoing results by reflecting on an experiment\r\nperformed by Mr. Faraday, at a Friday evening meeting of the Royal\r\nInstitution, on the 7th of June, 1850, and described in the 'Athenaeum'\r\nand 'Literary Gazette' for the same month. Mr. Faraday then showed that\r\nwhen two pieces of ice, with moistened surfaces, were placed in contact,\r\nthey became cemented together by the freezing of the film of water\r\nbetween them, while, when the ice was below 32 deg. Fahr., and therefore\r\n_dry_, no effect of the kind could be produced. The freezing was also\r\nfound to take place under water; and indeed it occurs even when the\r\nwater in which the ice is plunged is as hot as the hand can bear.\r\n\r\nA generalisation from this interesting fact led me to conclude that a\r\nbruised mass of ice, if closely confined, must re-cement itself when its\r\nparticles are brought into contact by pressure; in fact, the whole of\r\nthe experiments above recorded immediately suggested themselves to my\r\nmind as natural deductions from the principle established by Faraday. A\r\nrough preliminary experiment assured me that the deductions would stand\r\ntesting; and the construction of the box-wood moulds was the\r\nconsequence. We could doubtless mould many solid substances to any\r\nextent by suitable pressure, breaking the attachment of their particles,\r\nand re-establishing a certain continuity by the mere force of cohesion.\r\nWith such substances, to which we should never think of applying the\r\nterm viscous, we might also imitate the changes of form to which\r\nglaciers are subject: but, superadded to the mere cohesion which here\r\ncomes into play, we have, in the case of ice, the actual regelation of\r\nthe severed surfaces, and consequently a more perfect solid. In the\r\nIntroduction to this book I have referred to the production of slaty\r\ncleavage by pressure; and at a future page I hope to show that the\r\nlamination of the ice of glaciers is due to the same cause; but, as\r\njustly observed by Mr. John Ball, there is no tendency to cleave in the\r\n_sound_ ice of glaciers; in fact, this tendency is obliterated by the\r\nperfect regelation of the severed surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECENT EXPERIMENTS OF FARADAY.]\r\n\r\nMr. Faraday has recently placed pieces of ice, in water, under the\r\nstrain of forces tending to pull them apart. When two such pieces touch\r\nat a single point they adhere and move together as a rigid piece; but a\r\nlittle lateral force carefully applied breaks up this union with a\r\ncrackling noise, and a new adhesion occurs which holds the pieces\r\ntogether in opposition to the force which tends to divide them. Mr.\r\nJames Thomson had referred regelation to the cold produced by the\r\nliquefaction of the pressed ice; but in the above experiment all\r\npressure is not only taken away, but is replaced by tension. Mr. Thomson\r\nalso conceives that, when pieces of ice are simply placed together\r\nwithout intentional pressure, the capillary attraction brings the\r\npressure of the atmosphere into play; but Mr. Faraday finds that\r\nregelation takes place _in vacuo_. A true viscidity on the part of ice\r\nMr. Faraday never has observed, and he considers that his recent\r\nexperiments support the view originally propounded by himself, namely,\r\nthat a particle of water on a surface of ice becomes solid when placed\r\nbetween two surfaces, because of the increased influence due to their\r\njoint action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYSTALLIZATION AND INTERNAL LIQUEFACTION.\r\n\r\n(24.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOW CRYSTALS ARE \"NURSED.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction to this book I have briefly referred to the force of\r\ncrystallization. To permit this force to exercise its full influence, it\r\nmust have free and unimpeded action; a crystal, for instance, to be\r\nproperly built, ought to be suspended in the middle of the crystallizing\r\nsolution, so that the little architects can work all round it; or if\r\nplaced upon the bottom of a vessel, it ought to be frequently turned, so\r\nthat all its facets may be successively subjected to the building\r\nprocess. In this way crystals can be _nursed_ to an enormous size. But\r\nwhere other forces mingle with that of crystallization, this harmony of\r\naction is destroyed; the figures, for example, that we see upon a glass\r\nwindow, on a frosty morning, are due to an action compounded of the pure\r\ncrystalline force and the cohesion of the liquid to the window-pane. A\r\nmore regular effect is obtained when the freezing particles are\r\nsuspended in still air, and here they build themselves into those\r\nwonderful figures which Dr. Scoresby has observed in the Polar Regions,\r\nMr. Glaisher at Greenwich, and I myself on the summit of Monte Rosa and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nNot only however in air, but in water also, figures of great beauty are\r\nsometimes formed. Harrison's excellent machine for the production of\r\nartificial ice is, I suppose, now well known; the freezing being\r\neffected by carrying brine, which had been cooled by the evaporation of\r\nether, round a series of flat tin vessels containing water. The latter\r\ngradually freezes, and, on watching those vessels while the action was\r\nproceeding very slowly, I have seen little six-rayed stars of thin ice\r\nforming, and rising to the surface of the liquid. I believe the fact\r\nwas never before observed, but it would be interesting to follow it up,\r\nand to develop experimentally this most interesting case of\r\ncrystallization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISSECTION OF ICE BY SUNBEAM.]\r\n\r\nThe surface of a freezing lake presents to the eye of the observer\r\nnothing which could lead him to suppose that a similar molecular\r\narchitecture is going on there. Still the particles are undoubtedly\r\nrelated to each other in this way; they are arranged together on this\r\nstarry type. And not only is this the case at the surface, but the\r\nlargest blocks of ice which reach us from Norway and the Wenham Lake are\r\nwholly built up in this way. We can reveal the internal constitution of\r\nthese masses by a reverse process to that which formed them; we can send\r\nan agent into the interior of a mass of ice which shall take down the\r\natoms which the crystallizing forces had set up. This agent is a solar\r\nbeam; with which it first occurred to me to make this simple experiment\r\nin the autumn of 1857. I placed a large converging lens in the sunbeams\r\npassing through a room, and observed the place where the rays were\r\nbrought to a focus behind the lens; then shading the lens, I placed a\r\nclear cube of ice so that the point of convergence of the rays might\r\nfall within it. On removing the screen from the lens, a cone of sunlight\r\nwent through the cube, and along the course of the cone the ice became\r\nstudded with lustrous spots, evidently formed by the beam, as if minute\r\nreflectors had been suddenly established within the mass, from which the\r\nlight flashed when it met them. On examining the cube afterwards I found\r\nthat each of these spots was surrounded by a liquid flower of six\r\npetals; such flowers were distributed in hundreds through the ice, being\r\nusually clear and detached from each other, but sometimes crowded\r\ntogether into liquid bouquets, through which, however, the six-starred\r\nelement could be plainly traced. At first the edges of the leaves were\r\nunbroken curves, but when the flowers expanded under a long-continued\r\naction, the edges became serrated. When the ice was held at a suitable\r\nangle to the solar beams, these liquid blossoms, with their central\r\nspots shining more intensely than burnished silver, presented an\r\nexhibition of beauty not easily described. I have given a sketch of\r\ntheir appearance in Fig. 34.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIQUID FLOWERS IN ICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. Liquid Flowers in lake ice.]\r\n\r\nI have here to direct attention to an extremely curious fact. On sending\r\nthe sunbeam through the transparent ice, I often noticed that the\r\nappearance of the lustrous spots was accompanied by an audible clink, as\r\nif the ice were ruptured inwardly. But there is no ground for assuming\r\nsuch rupture, and on the closest examination no flaw is exhibited by the\r\nice. What then can be the cause of the noise? I believe the following\r\nconsiderations will answer the question:--\r\n\r\nWater always holds a quantity of air in solution, the diffusion of which\r\nthrough the liquid, as proved by M. Donny, has an immense effect in\r\nweakening the cohesion of its particles; recent experiments of my own\r\nshow that this is also the case in an eminent degree with many volatile\r\nliquids. M. Donny has proved that, if water be thoroughly purged of its\r\nair, a long glass tube filled with this liquid may be inverted, while\r\nthe tenacity with which the water clings to the tube, and with which its\r\nparticles cling to each other, is so great that it will remain securely\r\nsuspended, though no external hindrance be offered to its descent. Owing\r\nto the same cause, water deprived of its air will not boil at 212 deg.\r\nFahr., and may be raised to a temperature of nearly 300 deg. without\r\nboiling; but when this occurs the particles break their cohesion\r\nsuddenly, and ebullition is converted into explosion.\r\n\r\nNow, when ice is formed, every trace of the air which the water\r\ncontained is squeezed out of it; the particles in crystallizing reject\r\nall extraneous matter, so that in ice we have a substance quite free\r\nfrom the air, which is never absent in the case of water; it therefore\r\nfollows that if we could preserve the water derived from the melting of\r\nice from contact with the atmosphere, we should have a liquid eminently\r\ncalculated to show the effects described by M. Donny. Mr. Faraday has\r\nproved by actual experiment that this is the case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WATER DEPRIVED OF AIR SNAPS ASUNDER.]\r\n\r\nLet us apply these facts to the explanation of the clink heard in my\r\nexperiments. On sending a sunbeam through ice, liquid cavities are\r\nsuddenly formed at various points within the mass, and these cavities\r\nare completely cut off from atmospheric contact. But the water formed by\r\nthe melting ice is less in volume than the ice which produces it; the\r\nwater of a cavity is not able to fill it, hence a vacuous space must be\r\nformed in the cell. I have no doubt that, for a time, the strong\r\ncohesion between the walls of the cell and the drop within it augments\r\nthe volume of the latter a little, so as to compel it to fill the cell;\r\nbut as the quantity of liquid becomes greater the shrinking force\r\naugments, until finally the particles snap asunder like a broken spring.\r\nAt the same moment a lustrous spot appears, which is a vacuum, and\r\nsimultaneously with the appearance of this vacuum the clink was always\r\nheard. Multitudes of such little explosions must be heard upon a glacier\r\nwhen the strong summer sun shines upon it, the aggregate of which must,\r\nI think, contribute to produce the \"crepitation\" noticed by M. Agassiz,\r\nand to which I have already referred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIGURES IN ICE; VACUOUS SPOTS.]\r\n\r\nIn Plate VI. of the Atlas which accompanies the 'Systeme Glaciaire' of\r\nM. Agassiz, I notice drawings of figures like those I have described,\r\nwhich he has observed in glacier-ice, and which were doubtless produced\r\nby direct solar radiation. I have often myself observed figures of\r\nexquisite beauty formed in the ice on the surface of glacier-pools by\r\nthe morning sun. In some cases the spaces between the leaves of the\r\nliquid flowers melt partially away, and leave the central spot\r\nsurrounded by a crimped border; sometimes these spaces wholly disappear,\r\nand the entire space bounded by the lines drawn from point to point of\r\nthe leaves becomes liquid, thus forming perfect hexagons. The crimped\r\nborders exhibit different degrees of serration, from the full leaves\r\nthemselves to a gentle undulating line, which latter sometimes merges\r\ninto a perfect circle. In the ice of glaciers, I have seen the internal\r\nliquefaction ramify itself like sprigs of myrtle; in the same ice, and\r\nparticularly towards the extremities of the glacier, disks innumerable\r\nare also formed, consisting of flat round liquid spaces, a bright spot\r\nbeing usually associated with each. These spots have been hitherto\r\nmistaken for air-bubbles; but both they and the lustrous disks at the\r\ncentres of the flowers are vacuous. I proved them to be so by plunging\r\nthe ice containing them into hot water, and watching what occurred when\r\nthe walls of the cells were dissolved, and a liquid connexion\r\nestablished between them and the atmosphere. In all cases they totally\r\ncollapsed, and no trace of air rose to the surface of the warm water.\r\n\r\nNo matter in what direction a solar beam is sent through lake-ice, the\r\nliquid flowers are all formed parallel to the surface of freezing. The\r\nbeam may be sent parallel, perpendicular, or oblique to this surface;\r\nthe flowers are always formed in the same planes. Every line\r\nperpendicular to the surface of a frozen lake is in fact an axis of\r\nsymmetry, round which the molecules so arrange themselves, that, when\r\ntaken down by the delicate fingers of the sunbeam, the six-leaved liquid\r\nflowers are the result.\r\n\r\nIn the ice of glaciers we have no definite planes of freezing. It is\r\nfirst snow, which has been disturbed by winds while falling, and whirled\r\nand tossed about by the same agency after it has fallen, being often\r\nmelted, saturated with its own water, and refrozen: it is cast in\r\nshattered fragments down cascades, and reconsolidated by pressure at the\r\nbottom. In ice so formed and subjected to such mutations, definite\r\nplanes of freezing are, of course, out of the question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONSTITUTION OF GLACIER-ICE.]\r\n\r\nThe flat round disks and vacuous spots to which I have referred come\r\nhere to our aid, and furnish us with an entirely new means of analysing\r\nthe internal constitution of a glacier. When we examine a mass of\r\nglacier-ice which contains these disks, we find them lying in all\r\nimaginable planes; not confusedly, however--closer examination shows us\r\nthat the disks are arranged in groups, the members of each group being\r\nparallel to a common plane, but the parallelism ceases when different\r\ngroups are compared. The effect is exactly what would be observed,\r\nsupposing ordinary lake-ice to be broken up, shaken together, and the\r\nconfused fragments regelated to a compact continuous mass. In such a\r\njumble the original planes of freezing would lie in various directions;\r\nbut no matter how compact or how transparent ice thus constituted might\r\nappear, a solar beam would at once reveal its internal constitution by\r\ndeveloping the flowers parallel to the planes of freezing of the\r\nrespective fragments. A sunbeam sent through glacier-ice always reveals\r\nthe flowers in the planes of the disks, so that the latter alone at\r\nonce informs us of its crystalline constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VACUOUS CELLS MISTAKEN FOR AIR-CELLS.]\r\n\r\nHitherto, as I have said, these disks have been mistaken for bubbles\r\ncontaining air, and their flattening has been ascribed to the pressure\r\nto which they have been subjected. M. Agassiz thus refers to them:--\"The\r\nair-bubbles undergo no less curious modifications. In the neighbourhood\r\nof the _neve_, where they are most numerous, those which one sees on the\r\nsurface are all spherical or ovoid, but by degrees they begin to be\r\nflattened, and near the end of the glacier there are some that are so\r\nflat _that they might be taken for fissures when seen in profile_. The\r\ndrawing represents a piece of ice detached from the gallery of\r\ninfiltration. All the bubbles are greatly flattened. But what is most\r\nextraordinary is, that, far from being uniform, _the flattening is\r\ndifferent in each fragment_; so that the bubbles, according to the face\r\nwhich they offer, appear either very broad or very thin.\" This\r\ndescription of glacier-ice is correct: it agrees with the statements of\r\nall other observers. But there are two assumptions in the description\r\nwhich must henceforth be given up; first, the bubbles seen like fissures\r\nin profile are not air-bubbles at all, but vacuous spots, which the very\r\nconstitution of ice renders a necessary concomitant of its inward\r\nmelting; secondly, the assumption that the bubbles have been _flattened_\r\nby pressure must be abandoned; for they are found, and may be developed\r\nat will, in lake-ice on which no pressure has been exerted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CELLS OF AIR AND WATER.]\r\n\r\nBut these remarks dispose only of a certain class of cells contained in\r\nglacier-ice. Besides the liquid disks and vacuous spots, there are\r\ninnumerable true bubbles entangled in the mass. These have also been\r\nobserved and described by M. Agassiz; and Mr. Huxley has also given us\r\nan accurate account of them. M. Agassiz frequently found air and water\r\nassociated in the same cell. Mr. Huxley found no exception to the rule:\r\nin each case the bubble of air was enclosed in a cell which was also\r\npartially filled with water. He supposes that the water may be that of\r\nthe originally-melted snow which has been carried down from the _neve_\r\nunfrozen. This hypothesis is worthy of a great deal more consideration\r\nthan I have had time to give to it, and I state it here in the hope that\r\nit will be duly examined.\r\n\r\nMy own experience of these associated air and water cells is derived\r\nalmost exclusively from lake-ice, in which I have often observed them in\r\nconsiderable numbers. In examining whether the liquid contents had ever\r\nbeen frozen or not, I was guided by the following considerations. If the\r\nair be that originally entangled in the solid, it will have the ordinary\r\natmospheric density at least; but if it be due to the melting of the\r\nwalls of the cell, then the water so formed being only eight-ninths of\r\nthat of the ice which produced it, _the air of the bubble must be\r\nrarefied_. I suppose I have made a hundred different experiments upon\r\nthese bubbles to determine whether the air was rarefied or not, and in\r\nevery case found it so. Ice containing the bubbles was immersed in warm\r\nwater, and always, when the rigid envelope surrounding a bubble was\r\nmelted away, the air suddenly collapsed to a fraction of its original\r\ndimensions. I think I may safely affirm that, in some cases, the\r\ncollapse reduced the bubbles to the thousandth part of their original\r\nvolume. From these experiments I should undoubtedly infer, that in\r\nlake-ice at least, the liquid of the cells is produced by the melting of\r\nthe ice surrounding the bubbles of air.\r\n\r\nBut I have not subjected the bubbles of glacier-ice to the same\r\nsearching examination. I have tried whether the insertion of a pin would\r\nproduce the collapse of the bubbles, but it did not appear to do so. I\r\nalso made a few experiments at Rosenlaui, with warm water, but the\r\nresult was not satisfactory. That ice melts internally at the surfaces\r\nof the bubbles is, I think, rendered certain by my experiments, but\r\nwhether the water-cells of glacier-ice are entirely due to such melting,\r\nsubsequent observers will no doubt determine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"LIQUID LIBERTY.\"]\r\n\r\nI have found these composite bubbles at all parts of glaciers; in the\r\nice of the moraines, over which a protective covering had been thrown;\r\nin the ice of sand-cones, after the removal of the superincumbent\r\ndebris; also in ice taken from the roofs of caverns formed in the\r\nglacier, and which the direct sunlight could hardly by any possibility\r\nattain. That ice should liquefy at the surface of a cavity is, I think,\r\nin conformity with all we know concerning the physical nature of heat.\r\nRegarding it as a motion of the particles, it is easy to see that this\r\nmotion is less restrained at the surface of a cavity than in the solid\r\nitself, where the oscillation of each atom is controlled by the\r\nparticles which surround it; hence _liquid liberty_, if I may use the\r\nterm, is first attained at the surface. Indeed I have proved by\r\nexperiment that ice may be melted internally by heat which has been\r\nconducted through its external portions without melting them. These\r\nfacts are the exact complements of those of \"regelation;\" for here, two\r\nmoist surfaces of ice being brought into close contact, their liquid\r\nliberty is destroyed and the surfaces freeze together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOULINS.\r\n\r\n(25.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOULIN OF GRINDELWALD GLACIER.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPTH OF THE SHAFT.]\r\n\r\nThe first time I had an opportunity of seeing these remarkable\r\nglacier-chimneys was in the summer of 1856, upon the lower glacier of\r\nGrindelwald. Mr. Huxley was my companion at the time, and on crossing\r\nthe so-called Eismeer we heard a sound resembling the rumble of distant\r\nthunder, which proceeded from a perpendicular shaft formed in the ice,\r\nand into which a resounding cataract discharged itself. The tube in fact\r\nresembled a vast organ-pipe, whose thunder-notes were awakened by the\r\nconcussion of the falling water, instead of by the gentle flow of a\r\ncurrent of air. Beside the shaft our guide hewed steps, on which we\r\nstood in succession, and looked into the tremendous hole. Near the first\r\nshaft was a second and smaller one, the significance of which I did not\r\nthen understand; it was not more than 20 feet deep, but seemed filled\r\nwith a liquid of exquisite blue, the colour being really due to the\r\nmagical shimmer from the walls of the moulin, which was quite empty. As\r\nfar as we could see, the large shaft was vertical, but on dropping a\r\nstone into it a shock was soon heard, and after a succession of bumps,\r\nwhich occupied in all seven seconds, we heard the stone no more. The\r\ndepth of the moulin could not be thus ascertained, but we soon found a\r\nsecond and still larger one which gave us better data. A stone dropped\r\ninto this descended without interruption for four seconds, when a\r\nconcussion was heard; and three seconds afterwards the final shock was\r\naudible: there was thus but a single interruption in the descent.\r\nSupposing all the acquired velocity to have been destroyed by the shock,\r\nby adding the space passed over by the stone in four and in three\r\nseconds respectively, and making allowance for the time required by the\r\nsound to ascend from the bottom, we find the depth of the shaft to be\r\nabout 345 feet. There is, however, no reason to suppose that this\r\nmeasures the depth of the glacier at the place referred to. These shafts\r\nare to be found in almost all great glaciers; they are very numerous in\r\nthe Unteraar Glacier, numbers of them however being empty. On the Mer de\r\nGlace they are always to be found in the region of Trelaporte, one of\r\nthe shafts there being, _par excellence_, called the Grand Moulin. Many\r\nof them also occur on the Glacier de Lechaud.\r\n\r\nAs truly observed by M. Agassiz, these moulins occur only at those parts\r\nof the glacier which are not much rent by fissures, for only at such\r\nportions can the little rills produced by superficial melting collect to\r\nform streams of any magnitude. The valley of unbroken ice formed in the\r\nMer de Glace near Trelaporte is peculiarly favourable for the collection\r\nof such streams; we see the little rills commencing, and enlarging by\r\nthe contributions of others, the trunk-rill pouring its contents into a\r\nlittle stream which stretches out a hundred similar arms over the\r\nsurface of the glacier. Several such streams join, and finally a\r\nconsiderable brook, which receives the superficial drainage of a large\r\narea, cuts its way through the ice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOULINS EXPLAINED.]\r\n\r\nBut although this portion of the glacier is free from those\r\nlong-continued and permanent strains which, having once rent the ice,\r\ntend subsequently to widen the rent and produce yawning crevasses, it is\r\nnot free from local strains sufficient to produce _cracks_ which\r\npenetrate the glacier to a great depth. Imagine such a crack\r\nintersecting such a glacier-rivulet as we have described. The water\r\nrushes down it, and soon scoops a funnel large enough to engulf the\r\nentire stream. The moulin is thus formed, and, as the ice moves\r\ndownward, the sides of the crack are squeezed together and regelated,\r\nthe seam which marks the line of junction being in most cases distinctly\r\nvisible. But as the motion continues, other portions of the glacier come\r\ninto the same state of strain as that which produced the first crack; a\r\nsecond one is formed across the stream, the old shaft is forsaken, and a\r\nnew one is hollowed out, in which for a season the cataract plays the\r\nthunderer. I have in some cases counted the forsaken shafts of six old\r\nmoulins in advance of an active one. Not far from the Grand Moulin of\r\nthe Mer de Glace in 1857 there was a second empty shaft, which evidently\r\ncommunicated by a subglacial duct with that into which the torrent was\r\nprecipitated. Out of the old orifice issued a strong cold blast, the air\r\nbeing manifestly impelled through the duct by the falling water of the\r\nadjacent moulin.\r\n\r\nThese shafts are always found in the same locality; the portion of the\r\nMer de Glace to which I have referred is never without them. Some of the\r\nguides affirm that they are motionless; and a statement of Prof. Forbes\r\nhas led to the belief that this was also his opinion.[A] M. Agassiz,\r\nhowever, observed the motion of some of these shafts upon the glacier of\r\nthe Aar; and when on the spot in 1857, I was anxious to decide the point\r\nby accurate measurements with the theodolite.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mr. Hirst took charge of the instrument, and on the 28th of\r\nJuly I fixed a single stake beside the Grand Moulin, in a straight line\r\nbetween a station at Trelaporte and a well-defined mark on the rock at\r\nthe opposite side of the valley. On the 31st, the displacement of the\r\nstake amounted to 50 inches, and on the 1st of August it had moved\r\n74-1/2 inches--the moulin, to all appearance, occupying throughout the\r\nsame position with regard to the stake. To render this certain,\r\nmoreover we subsequently drove two additional stakes into the ice, thus\r\nenclosing the mouth of the shaft in a triangle. On the 8th of August the\r\ndisplacements were measured and gave the following results:--\r\n\r\n                          Total Motion.\r\n  First (old) stake       198 inches.\r\n  Second (new) do.        123   \"\r\n  Third                   124   \"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOTION OF THE MOULINS.]\r\n\r\nThe old stake had been fixed for 11 days, and its daily motion--_which\r\nwas also that of the moulin_--averaged 18 inches a day. Hence the\r\nmoulins share the general motion of the glacier, and their apparent\r\npermanence is not, as has been alleged, a proof of the semi-fluidity of\r\nthe glacier, but is due to the breaking of the ice as it passes the\r\nplace of local strain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPTH OF \"GRAND MOULIN\" SOUGHT.]\r\n\r\nWishing to obtain some estimate as to the depth of the ice, Mr. Hirst\r\nundertook the sounding of some of the moulins upon the Glacier de\r\nLechaud, making use of a tin vessel filled with lumps of lead and iron\r\nas a weight. The cord gave way and he lost his plummet. To measure the\r\ndepth of the Grand Moulin, we obtained fresh cord from Chamouni, to\r\nwhich we attached a four-pound weight. Into a cavity at the bottom of\r\nthe weight we stuffed a quantity of butter, to indicate the nature of\r\nthe bottom against which the weight might strike. The weight was dropped\r\ninto the shaft, and the cord paid out until its slackening informed us\r\nthat the weight had come to rest; by shaking the string, however, and\r\nwalking round the edge of the shaft, the weight was liberated, and sank\r\nsome distance further. The cord partially slackened a second time, but\r\nthe strain still remaining was sufficient to render it doubtful whether\r\nit was the weight or the action of the falling water which produced it.\r\nWe accordingly paid out the cord to the end, but, on withdrawing it,\r\nfound that the greater part of it had been coiled and knotted up by the\r\nfalling water. We uncoiled, and sounded again. At a depth of 132 feet\r\nthe weight reached a ledge or protuberance of ice, and by shaking and\r\nlifting it, it was caused to descend 31 feet more. A depth of 163 feet\r\nwas the utmost we could attain to. We sounded the old moulin to a depth\r\nof 90 feet; while a third little shaft, beside the large one, measured\r\nonly 18 feet in depth. We could see the water escape from it through a\r\nlateral canal at its bottom, and doubtless the water of the Grand Moulin\r\nfound a similar exit. There was no trace of dirt upon the butter, which\r\nmight have indicated that we had reached the bed of the glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"Every year, and year after year, the watercourses follow the same\r\nlines of direction--their streams are precipitated into the heart of the\r\nglacier by vertical funnels, called 'moulins,' at the very same\r\npoints.\"--Forbes's Fourth Letter upon Glaciers: 'Occ. Pap.,' p. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIRT-BANDS OF THE MER DE GLACE, AS SEEN FROM A POINT\r\nNEAR THE FLEGERE.\r\nFig. 35. _To face p. 367._]\r\n\r\nDIRT-BANDS OF THE MER DE GLACE.\r\n\r\n(26.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIRT-BANDS FROM THE FLEGERE.]\r\n\r\nThese bands were first noticed by Prof. Forbes on the 24th of July,\r\n1842, and were described by him in the following words:--\"My eye was\r\ncaught by a very peculiar appearance of the surface of the ice, which I\r\nwas certain that I now saw for the first time. It consisted of nearly\r\nhyperbolic brownish bands on the glacier, the curves pointing downwards,\r\nand the two branches mingling indiscriminately with the moraines,\r\npresenting an appearance of a succession of waves some hundred feet\r\napart.\"[A] From no single point of view hitherto attained can all the\r\nDirt-Bands of the Mer de Glace be seen at once. To see those on the\r\nterminal portion of the glacier, a station ought to be chosen on the\r\nopposite range of the Brevent, a few hundred yards beyond the Croix de\r\nla Flegere, where we stand exactly in front of the glacier as it issues\r\ninto the valley of Chamouni. The appearance of the bands upon the\r\nportion here seen is represented in Fig. 35.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the bands are confined to one side of the glacier,\r\nand either do not exist, or are obliterated by the debris, upon the\r\nother side. The cause of the accumulation of dirt on the right side of\r\nthe glacier is, that no less than five moraines are crowded together at\r\nthis side. In the upper portions of the Mer de Glace these moraines are\r\ndistinct from each other; but in descending, the successive engulfments\r\nand disgorgings of the blocks and dirt have broken up the moraines; and\r\nat the place now before us the materials which composed them are strewn\r\nconfusedly on the right side of the glacier. The portion of the ice on\r\nwhich the dirt-bands appear is derived from the Col du Geant. They do\r\nnot quite extend to the end of the glacier, being obliterated by the\r\ndislocation of the ice upon the frozen cascade of Des Bois.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIRT-BANDS FROM LES CHARMOZ.]\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed across the valley of Chamouni to the Montanvert;\r\nwhere, climbing the adjacent heights to an elevation of six or eight\r\nhundred feet above the hotel, we command a view of the Mer de Glace,\r\nfrom Trelaporte almost to the commencement of the Glacier des Bois. It\r\nwas from this position that Professor Forbes first observed the bands.\r\nFifteen, sixteen, and seventeen years later I observed them from the\r\nsame position. The number of bands which Professor Forbes counted from\r\nthis position was eighteen, with which my observations agree. The entire\r\nseries of bands which I observed, with the exception of one or two, must\r\nhave been the _successors_ of those observed by Professor Forbes; and my\r\nfinding the same number after an interval of so many years proves that\r\nthe bands must be due to some regularly recurrent cause. Fig. 36\r\nrepresents the bands as seen from the heights adjacent to the\r\nMontanvert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIRT-BANDS OF THE MER DE GLACE, AS SEEN FROM LES CHARMOZ.\r\nFig. 36. _To face p. 368._]\r\n\r\nI would here direct attention to an analogy between a glacier and a\r\nriver, which may be observed from the heights above the Montanvert, but\r\nto which no reference, as far as I know, has hitherto been made. When a\r\nriver meets the buttress of a bridge, the water rises against it, and,\r\non sweeping round it, forms an elevated ridge, between which and the\r\npier a depression occurs which varies in depth with the force of the\r\ncurrent. This effect is shown by the Mer de Glace on an exaggerated\r\nscale. Sweeping round Trelaporte, the ice pushes itself beyond the\r\npromontory in an elevated ridge, from which it drops by a gradual slope\r\nto the adjacent wall of the valley, thus forming a depression typified\r\nby that already alluded to. A similar effect is observed at the opposite\r\nside of the glacier on turning round the Echelets; and both combine\r\nto form a kind of skew surface. A careful inspection of the\r\nfrontispiece will detect this peculiarity in the shape of the glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FROM THE CLEFT-STATION.]\r\n\r\nFrom neither of the stations referred to do we obtain any clue to the\r\norigin of the dirt-bands. A stiff but pleasant climb will place us in\r\nthat singular cleft in the cliffy mountain-ridge which is seen to the\r\nright of the frontispiece; and from it we easily attain the high\r\nplatform of rock immediately to the left of it. We stand here high above\r\nthe promontory of Trelaporte, and occupy the finest station from which\r\nthe Mer de Glace and its tributaries can be viewed. From this station we\r\ntrace the dirt-bands over most of the ice that we have already scanned,\r\nand have the further advantage of being able to follow them to their\r\nvery source.\r\n\r\nThis source is the grand ice-cascade which descends in a succession of\r\nprecipices from the plateau of the Col du Geant into the valley which\r\nthe Glacier du Geant fills. We see from our present point of view that\r\nthe bands _are confined to the portion of the glacier which has\r\ndescended the cascade_. Fig. 37 represents the bands as seen from the\r\nCleft-station above Trelaporte.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIRT-BANDS OF THE MER DE GLACE, AS SEEN FROM THE CLEFT\r\nSTATION, TRELAPORTE.\r\nFig. 37. _To face p. 369._]\r\n\r\nWe are now however at such a height above the glacier and at such a\r\ndistance from the base of the cascade, that we can form but an imperfect\r\nnotion of the true contour of the surface. Let us therefore descend, and\r\nwalk up the Glacier du Geant towards the cascade. At first our road is\r\nlevel, but we gradually find that at certain intervals we have to ascend\r\nslopes which follow each other in succession, each being separated from\r\nits neighbour by a space of comparatively level ice. The slopes increase\r\nin steepness as we ascend; they are steepest, moreover, on the\r\nright-hand side of the glacier, where it is bounded by that from the\r\nPeriades, and at length we are unable to climb them without the aid of\r\nan axe. Soon afterwards the dislocation of the glacier becomes\r\nconsiderable; we are lost in the clefts and depressions of the ice, and\r\nare unable to obtain a view sufficiently commanding to subdue these\r\nlocal appearances and convey to us the general aspect. We have at all\r\nevents satisfied ourselves as to the existence, on the upper portion of\r\nthe glacier, of a succession of undulations which sweep transversely\r\nacross it. The term \"wrinkles,\" applied to them by Prof. Forbes, is\r\nhighly suggestive of the appearance which they present.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SNOW-BANDS ON THE GLACIER DU GEANT.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Cleft-station bands of snow may also be seen partially crossing\r\nthe glacier in correspondence with the undulations upon its surface. If\r\nthe quantity deposited the winter previous be large, and the heat of\r\nsummer not too great, these bands extend quite across the glacier. They\r\nwere first observed by Professor Forbes in 1843. In his Fifth Letter is\r\ngiven an illustrative diagram, which, though erroneous as regards the\r\nposition of the veined structure, is quite correct in limiting the\r\nsnow-bands to the Glacier du Geant proper.\r\n\r\nAt the place where the three welded tributaries of the Mer de Glace\r\nsqueeze themselves through the strait of Trelaporte, the bands undergo a\r\nconsiderable modification in shape. Near their origin they sweep across\r\nthe Glacier du Geant in gentle curves, with their convexities directed\r\ndownwards; but at Trelaporte these curves, the chords of which a short\r\ntime previous measured a thousand yards in length, have to squeeze\r\nthemselves through a space of four hundred and ninety-five yards wide;\r\nand as might be expected, they are here suddenly sharpened. The apex of\r\neach being thrust forward, they take the form of sharp hyperbolas, and\r\npreserve this character throughout the entire length of the Mer de\r\nGlace.\r\n\r\nI would now conduct the reader to a point from which a good general view\r\nof the ice cascade of the Geant is attainable. From the old moraine near\r\nthe lake of the Tacul we observe the ice, as it descends the fall, to\r\nbe broken into a succession of precipices. It would appear as if the\r\nglacier had its back periodically broken at the summit of the fall, and\r\nformed a series of vast chasms separated from each other by cliffy\r\nridges of corresponding size. These, as they approach the bottom of the\r\nfall, become more and more toned down by the action of sun and air, and\r\nat some distance below the base of the cascade they are subdued so as to\r\nform the transverse undulations already described. These undulations are\r\nmore and more reduced as the glacier descends; and long before the Tacul\r\nis attained, every sensible trace of them has disappeared. The terraces\r\nof the ice-fall are referred to by Professor Forbes in his Thirteenth\r\nLetter, where he thus describes them:--\"The ice-falls succeed one\r\nanother at regulated intervals, which appear to correspond to the\r\nrenewal of each summer's activity in those realms of almost perpetual\r\nfrost, when a swifter motion occasions a more rapid and wholesale\r\nprojection of the mass over the steep, thus forming curvilinear terraces\r\nlike vast stairs, which appear afterwards by consolidation to form the\r\nremarkable protuberant wrinkles on the surface of the Glacier du Geant.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORBES'S EXPLANATION.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the cause of the distribution of the dirt in bands,\r\nProfessor Forbes writes thus in his Third Letter:--\"I at length assured\r\nmyself that it was entirely owing to the structure of the ice, which\r\nretains the dirt diffused by avalanches and the weather on those parts\r\nwhich are most porous, whilst the compacter portion is washed clean by\r\nthe rain, so that those bands are nothing more than visible traces of\r\nthe direction of the internal icy structure.\" Professor Forbes's theory,\r\nat that time, was that the glacier is composed throughout of a series of\r\nalternate segments of hard and porous ice, in the latter of which the\r\ndirt found a lodgment. I do not know whether he now retains his first\r\nopinion; but in his Fifteenth Letter he speaks of accounting for \"the\r\nless compact structure of the ice beneath the dirt-band.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that in the above explanation cause has been mistaken\r\nfor effect. The ice on which the dirt-bands rest certainly appears to be\r\nof a spongier character than the cleaner intermediate ice; but instead\r\nof this being the cause of the dirt-bands, the latter, I imagine, by\r\ntheir more copious absorption of the sun's rays and the consequent\r\ngreater disintegration of the ice, are the cause of the apparent\r\nporosity. I have not been able to detect any relative porosity in the\r\n\"internal icy structure,\" nor am I able to find in the writings of\r\nProfessor Forbes a description of the experiments whereby he satisfied\r\nhimself that this assumed difference exists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRANSVERSE UNDULATIONS.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INFLUENCE OF DIRECTION OF GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nSeveral days of the summer of 1857 were devoted by me to the examination\r\nof these bands. I then found the bases and the frontal slopes of the\r\nundulations to which I have referred covered with a fine brown mud.\r\nThese slopes were also, in some cases, covered with snow which the great\r\nheat of the weather had not been able entirely to remove. At places\r\nwhere the residue of snow was small its surface was exceedingly\r\ndirty--so dirty indeed that it appeared as if peat-mould had been strewn\r\nover it; its edges particularly were of a black brown. It was perfectly\r\nmanifest that this snow formed a receptacle for the fine dirt\r\ntransported by the innumerable little rills which trickled over the\r\nglacier. The snow gradually wasted, but it left its sediment behind, and\r\nthus each of the snowy bands observed by Professor Forbes in 1843,\r\ncontributed to produce an appearance perfectly antithetical to its own.\r\nI have said that the frontal slopes of the undulations were thus\r\ncovered; and it was on these, and not in the depressions, that the snow\r\nprincipally rested. The reason of this is to be found in the _bearing_\r\nof the Glacier du Geant, which, looking downwards, is about fourteen\r\ndegrees east of the meridian.[B] Hence the frontal slopes of the\r\nundulations have a _northern aspect_, and it is this circumstance which,\r\nin my opinion, causes the retention of the snow upon them. Irrespective\r\nof the snow, the mere tendency of the dirt to accumulate at the bases of\r\nthe undulations would also produce bands, and indeed does so on many\r\nglaciers; but the precision and beauty of the dirt-bands of the Mer de\r\nGlace are, I think, to be mainly referred to the interception by the\r\nsnow of the fine dark mud before referred to on the northern slopes of\r\nits undulations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BANDS DO NOT CROSS MORAINES.]\r\n\r\nWere the statements of some writers upon this subject well founded, or\r\nwere the dirt-bands as drawn upon the map of Professor Forbes correctly\r\nshown, this explanation could not stand a moment. It has been urged that\r\nthe dirt-bands cannot thus belong to a single tributary of the Mer de\r\nGlace; for if they did, they would be confined to that tributary upon\r\nthe trunk-glacier; whereas the fact is that they extend quite across the\r\ntrunk, and intersect the moraines which divide the Glacier du Geant from\r\nits fellow-tributaries. From my first acquaintance with the Mer de Glace\r\nI had reason to believe that this statement was incorrect; but last year\r\nI climbed a third time to the Cleft-station for the purpose of once more\r\ninspecting the bands from this fine position. I was accompanied by Dr.\r\nFrankland and Auguste Balmat, and I drew the attention of both\r\nparticularly to this point. Neither of them could discern, nor could I,\r\nthe slightest trace of a dirt-band crossing any one of the moraines.\r\nUpon the trunk-stream they were just as much confined to the Glacier du\r\nGeant as ever. If the bands even existed east of the moraines, they\r\ncould not be seen, the dirt on this part of the glacier being sufficient\r\nto mask them.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting fact may perhaps have contributed to the\r\nproduction of the error referred to. Opposite to Trelaporte the eastern\r\narms of the dirt-bands run so obliquely into the moraine of La Noire\r\nthat the latter appears to be a tangent to them. But this moraine runs\r\nalong the Mer de Glace, not far from its centre, and consequently the\r\npoint of contact of each dirt-band with the moraine moves more quickly\r\nthan the point of contact of the western arm of the same band with the\r\nside of the valley. Hence there is a tendency to _straighten_ the bands;\r\nand at some distance down the glacier the effect of this is seen in the\r\nbands abutting against the moraine of La Noire at a larger angle than\r\nbefore. The branches thus abutting have, I believe, been ideally\r\nprolonged across the moraines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Plan of Dirt-bands taken from Johnson's\r\n'Physical Atlas.']\r\n\r\nOn the map published by Prof. Forbes in 1843 the bands are shown\r\ncrossing the medial moraines of the Mer de Glace; and they are also thus\r\ndrawn on the map in Johnson's 'Physical Atlas' published in 1849. The\r\ntext is also in accordance with the map:--\"Opposite to the Montanvert,\r\nand beyond les Echelets, the curved loops (dirt-bands) extend _across\r\nthe entire glacier_. They are single, and therefore _cut_ the medial\r\nmoraine, though at a very slight angle.\"--'Travels,' p. 166. The italics\r\nhere belong to Prof. Forbes. In order to help future observers to place\r\nthis point beyond doubt, I annex, in Fig. 38, a portion of the map of\r\nthe Mer de Glace taken from the Atlas referred to. If it be compared\r\nwith Fig. 35 the difference between Prof. Forbes and myself will be\r\nclearly seen. The portion of the glacier represented in both diagrams\r\nmay be viewed from the point near the Flegere already referred to.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANNUAL \"RINGS.\"]\r\n\r\nThe explanation which I have given involves three considerations:--The\r\ntransverse breaking of the glacier on the cascade, and the gradual\r\naccumulation of the dirt in the hollows between the ridges; the\r\nsubsequent toning down of the ridges to gentle protuberances which sweep\r\nacross the glacier; and the collection of the dirt upon the slopes and\r\nat the bases of these protuberances. Whether the periods of transverse\r\nfracture are annual or not--whether the \"wrinkles\" correspond to a\r\nyearly gush--and whether, consequently, the dirt-bands mark the growth\r\nof a glacier as the \"annual rings\" mark the growth of a tree, I do not\r\nknow. It is a conjecture well worthy of consideration; but it is only a\r\nconjecture, which future observation may either ratify or refute.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] 'Travels,' page 162.\r\n\r\n[B] In the large map of Professor Forbes the bearing of the valley is\r\nnearly sixty degrees west of the meridian; but this is caused by the\r\ntrue north being drawn on the wrong side of the magnetic north; thus\r\nmaking the declination easterly instead of westerly. In the map in\r\nJohnson's 'Physical Atlas' this mistake is corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VEINED STRUCTURE OF GLACIERS.\r\n\r\n(27.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENERAL APPEARANCE.]\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the veined structure may be thus briefly\r\ndescribed:--The ice of glaciers, especially midway between their\r\nmountain-sources and their inferior extremities, is of a whitish hue,\r\ncaused by the number of small air-bubbles which it contains, and which,\r\nno doubt, constitute the residue of the air originally entrapped in the\r\ninterstices of the snow from which it has been derived. Through the\r\ngeneral whitish mass, at some places, innumerable parallel veins of\r\nclearer ice are drawn, which usually present a beautiful blue colour,\r\nand give the ice a laminated appearance. The cause of the blueness is,\r\nthat the air-bubbles, distributed so plentifully through the general\r\nmass, do not exist in the veins, or only in comparatively small numbers.\r\n\r\nIn different glaciers, and in different parts of the same glacier, these\r\nveins display various degrees of perfection. On the clean unweathered\r\nwalls of some crevasses, and in the channels worn in the ice by\r\nglacier-streams, they are most distinctly seen, and are often\r\nexquisitely beautiful. They are not to be regarded as a partial\r\nphenomenon, or as affecting the constitution of glaciers to a small\r\nextent merely. A large portion of the ice of some glaciers is thus\r\naffected. The greater part, for example, of the Mer de Glace consists of\r\nthis laminated ice; and the whole of the Glacier of the Rhone, from the\r\nbase of the ice-cascade downwards, is composed of ice of the same\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GROOVES ON THE SURFACE OF GLACIERS.]\r\n\r\nThose who have ascended Snowdon, or wandered among the hills of\r\nCumberland, or even walked in the environs of Leeds, Blackburn, and\r\nother towns in Yorkshire and Lancashire, where the stratified sandstone\r\nof the district is used for building purposes, may have observed the\r\nweathered edges of the slate rocks or of the building-stone to be\r\ngrooved and furrowed. Some laminae of such rocks withstand the action of\r\nthe atmosphere better than others, and the more resistant ones stand out\r\nin ridges after the softer parts between them have been eaten away. An\r\neffect exactly similar is observed where the laminated ice of glaciers\r\nis exposed to the action of the sun and air. Little grooves and ridges\r\nare formed upon its surface, the more resistant plates protruding after\r\nthe softer material between them has been melted away.\r\n\r\nOne consequence of this furrowing is, that the light dirt scattered by\r\nthe winds over the surface of the glacier is gradually washed into the\r\nlittle grooves, thus forming fine lines resembling those produced by the\r\npassage of a rake over a sanded walk. These lines are a valuable index\r\nto some of the phenomena of motion. From a position on the ice of the\r\nGlacier du Geant a little higher up than Trelaporte a fine view of these\r\nsuperficial groovings is obtained; but the dirt-lines are not always\r\nstraight. A slight power of independent motion is enjoyed by the\r\nseparate parts into which a glacier is divided by its crevasses and\r\ndislocations, and hence it is, that, at the place alluded to, the\r\ndirt-lines are bent hither and thither, though the ruptures of\r\ncontinuity are too small to affect materially the general direction of\r\nthe structure. On the glacier of the Talefre I found these groovings\r\nuseful as indicating the character of the forces to which the ice near\r\nthe summit of the fall is subjected. The ridges between the chasms are\r\nin many cases violently bent and twisted, while the adjacent groovings\r\nenable us to see the normal position of the mass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GUYOT'S OBSERVATIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe veined structure has been observed by different travellers; but it\r\nwas probably first referred to by Sir David Brewster, who noticed the\r\nveins of the Mer de Glace on the 10th of September, 1814. It was also\r\nobserved by General Sabine,[A] by Rendu, by Agassiz, and no doubt by\r\nmany others; but the first clear description of it was given by M.\r\nGuyot, in a communication presented to the Geological Society of France\r\nin 1838. I quote the following passage from this paper:--\"I saw under my\r\nfeet the surface of the entire glacier covered with regular furrows from\r\none to two inches wide, hollowed out in a half snowy mass, and separated\r\nby protruding plates of harder and more transparent ice. It was evident\r\nthat the mass of the glacier here was composed of two sorts of ice, one\r\nthat of the furrows, snowy and more easily melted; the other that of the\r\nplates, more perfect, crystalline, glassy, and resistant; and that the\r\nunequal resistance which the two kinds of ice presented to the\r\natmosphere was the cause of the furrows and ridges. After having\r\nfollowed them for several hundreds of yards, I reached a fissure twenty\r\nor thirty feet wide, which, as it cut the plates and furrows at right\r\nangles, exposed the interior of the glacier to a depth of thirty or\r\nforty feet, and gave a beautiful transverse section of the structure. As\r\nfar as my vision could reach I saw the mass of the glacier composed of\r\nlayers of snowy ice, each two of which were separated by one of the\r\nplates of which I have spoken, the whole forming a regularly laminated\r\nmass, which resembled certain calcareous slates.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORBES'S RESEARCHES.]\r\n\r\nPrevious observers had mistaken the lamination for stratification; but\r\nM. Guyot not only clearly saw that they were different, but in the\r\ncomparison which he makes he touches, I believe, on the true cause of\r\nthe glacier-structure. He did not hazard an explanation of the\r\nphenomenon, and I believe his memoir remained unprinted. In 1841 the\r\nstructure was noticed by Professor Forbes during his visit to M. Agassiz\r\non the lower Aar Glacier, and described in a communication presented by\r\nhim to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He subsequently devoted much time\r\nto the subject, and his great merit in connexion with it consists in the\r\nsignificance which he ascribed to the phenomenon when he first observed\r\nit, and in the fact of his having proved it to be a constitutional\r\nfeature of glaciers in general.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORBES'S THEORY.]\r\n\r\nThe first explanation given of those veins by Professor Forbes was, that\r\nthey were small fissures formed in the ice by its motion; that these\r\nwere filled with the water of the melted ice in summer, which froze in\r\nwinter so as to form the blue veins. This is the explanation given in\r\nhis 'Travels,' page 377; and in a letter published in the 'Edinburgh New\r\nPhilosophical Journal,' October, 1844, it is re-affirmed in these\r\nwords:--\"With the abundance of blue bands before us in the direction in\r\nwhich the differential motion must take place (in this case sensibly\r\nparallel to the sides of the glacier), it is impossible to doubt that\r\nthese infiltrated crevices (for such they undoubtedly are) have this\r\norigin.\" This theory was examined by Mr. Huxley and myself in our joint\r\npaper; but it has been since alleged that ours was unnecessary labour,\r\nProf. Forbes himself having in his Thirteenth Letter renounced the\r\ntheory, and substituted another in its place. The latter theory differs,\r\nso far as I can understand it, from the former in this particular, that\r\nthe _freezing of the water_ in the fissures is discarded, their sides\r\nbeing now supposed to be united \"by the simple effects of time and\r\ncohesion.\"[B] For a statement of the change which his opinions have\r\nundergone, I would refer to the Prefatory Note which precedes the volume\r\nof 'Occasional Papers' recently published by Prof. Forbes; but it would\r\nhave diminished my difficulty had the author given, in connexion with\r\nhis new volume, a more distinct statement of his present views regarding\r\nthe veined structure. With many of his observations and remarks I should\r\nagree; with many others I cannot say whether I agree or not; and there\r\nare others still with which I do not think I should agree: but in hardly\r\nany case am I certain of his precise views, excepting, indeed, the\r\ncardinal one, wherein he and others agree in ascribing to the structure\r\na different origin from stratification. Thus circumstanced, my proper\r\ncourse, I think, will be to state what I believe to be the cause of the\r\nstructure, and leave it to the reader to decide how far our views\r\nharmonize; or to what extent either of them is a true interpretation of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: USUAL ASPECT OF BLUE VEINS.]\r\n\r\nMost of the earlier observers considered the structure to be due to the\r\nstratification of the mountain-snows--a view which has received later\r\ndevelopment at the hands of Mr. John Ball; and the practical difficulty\r\nof distinguishing the undoubted effects of _stratification_ from the\r\nphenomena presented by _structure_, entitles this view to the fullest\r\nconsideration. The blue veins of glaciers are, however, not always, nor\r\neven generally, such as we should expect to result from stratification.\r\nThe latter would furnish us with distinct planes extending parallel to\r\neach other for considerable distances through the glacier; but this,\r\nthough sometimes the case, is by no means the general character of the\r\nstructure. We observe blue streaks, from a few inches to several feet in\r\nlength, upon the walls of the same crevasse, and varying from the\r\nfraction of an inch to several inches in thickness. In some cases the\r\nstreaks are definitely bounded, giving rise to an appearance resembling\r\nthe section of a lens, and hence called the \"lenticular structure\" by\r\nMr. Huxley and myself; but more usually they fade away in pale washy\r\nstreaks through the general mass of the whitish ice. In Fig. 39 I have\r\ngiven a representation of the structure as it is very commonly exhibited\r\non the walls of crevasses. Its aspect is not that which we should expect\r\nfrom the consolidation of successive beds of mountain snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Veined Structure of the walls of crevasses.]\r\n\r\nFurther, at the bases of ice-cascades the structural laminae are usually\r\n_vertical_: below the cascade of the Talefre, of the Noire, of the\r\nStrahleck branch of the Lower Grindelwald Glacier, of the Rhone, and\r\nother ice-falls, this is the case; and it seems extremely difficult to\r\nconceive that a mass horizontally stratified at the summit of the fall,\r\nshould, in its descent, contrive to turn its strata perfectly on end.\r\n\r\nAgain, we often find a very feebly-developed structure at the central\r\nportions of a glacier, while the lateral portions are very decidedly\r\nlaminated. This is the case where the inclination of the glacier is\r\nnearly uniform throughout; and where no medial moraines occur to\r\ncomplicate the phenomenon. But if the veins mark the bedding, there\r\nseems to be no sufficient reason for their appearance at the lateral\r\nportions of the glacier, and their absence from the centre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ILLUSTRATIVE EXPERIMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThis leads me to the point at which what I consider to be the true cause\r\nof the structure may be referred to. The theoretic researches of Mr.\r\nHopkins have taught us a good deal regarding the pressures and tensions\r\nconsequent upon glacier-motion. Aided by this knowledge, and also by a\r\nmode of experiment first introduced by Professor Forbes, I will now\r\nendeavour to explain the significance of the fact referred to in the\r\nlast paragraph. If a plastic substance, such as mud, flow down a sloping\r\ncanal, the lateral portions, being held back by friction, will be\r\noutstripped by the central ones. When the flow is so regulated that the\r\nvelocity of a point at the centre shall not vary throughout the entire\r\nlength of the canal, a coloured circle stamped upon the centre of the\r\nmud stream, near its origin, will move along with the mud, and still\r\nretain its circular form; for, inasmuch as the velocity of all points\r\nalong the centre is the same, there can be no elongation of the circle\r\nlongitudinally or transversely by either strain or pressure. A similar\r\nabsence of longitudinal pressure may exist in a glacier, and, where it\r\nexists throughout, no central structure can, in my opinion, be\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nBut let a circle be stamped upon the mud-stream near its side, then,\r\nwhen the mud flows, this circle will be distorted to an oval, with its\r\nmajor axis oblique to the direction of motion; the cause of this is that\r\nthe portion of the circle farthest from the side of the canal moves\r\nmore freely than that adjacent to the side. The mechanical effect of the\r\nslower lateral motion is to squeeze the circle in one direction, and\r\ndraw it out in the perpendicular one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARGINAL STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Figure explanatory of the Marginal Structure.]\r\n\r\nA glance at Fig. 40 will render all that I have said intelligible. The\r\nthree circles are first stamped on the mud in the same transverse line;\r\nbut after they have moved downwards they will be in the same straight\r\nline no longer. The central one will be the foremost; while the lateral\r\nones have their forms changed from circles to ovals. In a glacier of the\r\nshape of this canal exactly similar effects are produced. Now the\r\nshorter axis _m n_ of each oval is a line of squeezing or pressure; the\r\nlonger axis is a line of strain or tension; and the associated\r\nglacier-phenomena are as follows:--Across the line _m n_, or\r\nperpendicular to the pressure, we have the _veined structure_ developed,\r\nwhile across the line of tension the glacier usually breaks and forms\r\n_marginal crevasses_. Mr. Hopkins has shown that the lines of greatest\r\npressure and of greatest strain are at right angles to each other, and\r\nthat in valleys of a uniform width they enclose an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees with the side of the glacier. To the structure thus formed I\r\nhave applied the term _marginal structure_. Here, then, we see that\r\nthere are mechanical agencies at work near the side of such a glacier\r\nwhich are absent from the centre, and we have effects developed--I\r\nbelieve _by the pressure_--in the lateral ice, which are not produced in\r\nthe central.\r\n\r\nI have used the term \"uniform inclination\" in connexion with the\r\nmarginal structure, and my reason for doing so will now appear. In many\r\nglaciers the structure, instead of being confined to the margins,\r\nsweeps quite across them. This is the case, for example, on the Glacier\r\ndu Geant, the structure of which is prolonged into the Mer de Glace. In\r\npassing the strait at Trelaporte, however, the curves are squeezed and\r\ntheir apices bruised, so that the structure is thrown into a state of\r\nconfusion; and thus upon the Mer de Glace we encounter difficulty in\r\ntracing it fairly from side to side. Now the key to this transverse\r\nstructure I believe to be the following: Where the inclination of the\r\nglacier suddenly changes from a steep slope to a gentler, as at the\r\nbases of the \"cascades,\"--the ice to a certain depth must be thrown into\r\na state of violent longitudinal compression; and along with this we have\r\nthe resistance which the gentler slope throws athwart the ice descending\r\nfrom the steep one. At such places a structure is developed transverse\r\nto the axis of the glacier, and likewise transverse to the pressure. The\r\nquicker flow of the centre causes this structure to bend more and more,\r\nand after a time it sweeps in vast curves across the entire glacier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE OF GRINDELWALD GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this point I will refer, in the first place, to that\r\ntributary of the Lower Glacier of Grindelwald which descends from the\r\nStrahleck. Walking up this tributary we come at length to the base of an\r\nice-fall. Let the observer here leave the ice, and betake himself to\r\neither side of the flanking mountain. On attaining a point which\r\ncommands a view both of the fall and of the glacier below it, an\r\ninspection of the glacier will, I imagine, solve to his satisfaction the\r\ncase of structure now under consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a grand experiment which Nature here submits to our\r\ninspection. The glacier descending from its _neve_ reaches the summit of\r\nthe cascade, and is broken transversely as it crosses the brow; it\r\nafterwards descends the fall in a succession of cliffy ice-ridges with\r\ntransverse hollows between them. In these latter the broken ice and\r\ndebris collect, thus partially choking the fissures formed in the first\r\ninstance. Carrying the eye downwards along the fall, we see, as we\r\napproach the base, these sharp ridges toned down; and a little below the\r\nbase they dwindle into rounded protuberances which sweep in curves quite\r\nacross the glacier. At the base of the fall the structure begins to\r\nappear, feebly at first, but becoming gradually more pronounced, until,\r\nat a short distance below the base of the fall, the eye can follow the\r\nfine superficial groovings from side to side; while at the same time the\r\nice underneath the surface has become laminated in the most beautiful\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey by writing the force of the evidence which the\r\nactual observation of this natural experiment places before the mind.\r\nThe ice at the base of the fall, retarded by the gentler inclination of\r\nthe valley, has to bear the thrust of the descending mass, the sudden\r\nchange of inclination producing powerful longitudinal compression. The\r\nprotuberances are squeezed more closely together, the hollows between\r\nthem appear to wrinkle up in submission to the pressure--in short, the\r\nentire aspect of the glacier suggests the powerful operations of the\r\nlatter force. At the place where _it_ is exerted the veined structure\r\nmakes its appearance; and being once formed, it moves downwards, and\r\ngives a character to other portions of the glacier which had no share in\r\nits formation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BASE OF CASCADE A \"STRUCTURE-MILL.\"]\r\n\r\nAn illustration almost as good, and equally accessible, is furnished by\r\nthe Glacier of the Rhone. I have examined the grand cascade of this\r\nglacier from both sides; and an ordinary mountaineer will find little\r\ndifficulty in reaching a point from which the fall and the terminal\r\nportion of the glacier are both distinctly visible. Here also he will\r\nfind the cliffy ridges separated from each other by transverse chasms,\r\nbecoming more and more subdued at the bottom of the fall, and\r\ndisappearing entirely lower down the glacier. As in the case of the\r\nGrindelwald Glacier the squeezing of the protuberances and of the spaces\r\nbetween them, is quite apparent, and where this squeezing commences the\r\ntransverse structure makes its appearance. All the ice that forms the\r\nlower portion of this glacier has to pass through the _structure-mill_\r\nat the bottom of the fall, and the consequence is that _it is all\r\nlaminated_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE OF RHONE GLACIER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Plan of part of ice-fall, and of glacier below\r\nit (Glacier of the Rhone).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. Section of part of ice-fall, and of glacier\r\nbelow it (Glacier of the Rhone).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRANSVERSE STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\nThis case of structural development will be better appreciated on\r\nreference to Figs. 41 and 42, the former of which is a plan, and the\r\nlatter a section, of a part of the ice-fall and of the glacier below it;\r\n_a b e f_ is the gorge of the fall, _f b_ being the base. The transverse\r\ncliffy ice-ridges are shown crossing the cascade, being subdued at the\r\nbase to protuberances which gradually disappear as they advance\r\ndownwards. The structure sweeps over the glacier in the direction of the\r\nfine curved lines; and I have also endeavoured to show the direction of\r\nthe radial crevasses, which, in the centre at least, are at right angles\r\nto the veins. To the manifestation of structure here considered I have,\r\nfor the sake of convenient reference, applied the term _transverse\r\nstructure_.\r\n\r\nA third exhibition of the structure is now to be noticed. We sometimes\r\nfind it in the _middle_ of a glacier and running _parallel_ to its\r\nlength. On the centre of the ice-fall of the Talefre, for example, we\r\nhave a structure of this kind which preserves itself parallel to the\r\naxis of the fall from top to bottom. But we discover its origin higher\r\nup. The structure here has been produced at the extremity of the Jardin,\r\nwhere the divided ice meets, and not only brings into partial\r\nparallelism the veins previously existing along the sides of the Jardin,\r\nbut develops them still further by the mutual pressure of the portions\r\nof newly welded ice. Where two tributary glaciers unite, this is perhaps\r\nwithout exception the case. Underneath the moraine formed by the\r\njunction of the Talefre and Lechaud the structure is finely developed,\r\nand the veins run in the direction of the moraine. The same is true of\r\nthe ice under the moraine formed by the junction of the Lechaud and\r\nGeant. These afterwards form the great medial moraines of the Mer de\r\nGlace, and hence the structure of the trunk-stream underneath these\r\nmoraines is parallel to the direction of the glacier. This is also true\r\nof the system of moraines formed by the glaciers of Monte Rosa. It is\r\ntrue in an especial manner of the lower glacier of the Aar, whose\r\nmedial moraine perhaps attains grander proportions than any other in the\r\nAlps, and underneath which the structure is finely developed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONGITUDINAL STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Figure explanatory of Longitudinal Structure.]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which I have illustrated the production of this structure\r\nwill be understood from Fig. 43. B B are two wooden boxes, communicating\r\nby sluice-fronts with two branch canals, which unite to a common trunk\r\nat G. They are intended to represent respectively the trunk and\r\ntributaries of the Unteraar Glacier, the part G being the Abschwung,\r\nwhere the Lauteraar and Finsteraar glaciers unite to form the Unteraar.\r\nThe mud is first permitted to flow beneath the two sluices until it has\r\ncovered the bottom of the trough for some distance, when it is arrested.\r\nThe end of a glass tube is then dipped into a mixture of rouge and\r\nwater, and small circles are stamped upon the mud. The two branches are\r\nthickly covered with these circles. The sluices being again raised, the\r\nmud in the branches moves downwards, carrying with it the circles\r\nstamped upon it; and the manner in which these circles are distorted\r\nenables us to infer the strains and pressures to which the mud is\r\nsubjected during its descent. The figure represents approximately what\r\ntakes place. The side-circles, as might be expected, are squeezed to\r\noblique ovals, but it is at the junction of the branches that the chief\r\neffect of pressure is produced. Here, by the mutual thrust of the\r\nbranches, the circles are not only changed to elongated ellipses, but\r\neven squeezed to straight lines. In the case of the glacier this is the\r\nregion at which the structure receives its main development. To this\r\nmanifestation of the veins I have applied the term _longitudinal\r\nstructure_.\r\n\r\nThe three main sources of the blue veins are, I think, here noted; but\r\nbesides these there are many local causes which influence their\r\nproduction. I have seen them well formed where a glacier is opposed by\r\nthe sudden bend of a valley, or by a local promontory which presents an\r\nobstacle sufficient to bring the requisite pressure into play. In the\r\nglaciers of the Tyrol and of the Oberland I have seen examples of this\r\nkind; but the three principal sources of the veins are, I think, those\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EFFORTS TO SOLVE QUESTION.]\r\n\r\nIt was long before I cleared my mind of doubt regarding the origin of\r\nthe lamination. When on the Mer de Glace in 1857 I spared neither risk\r\nnor labour to instruct myself regarding it. I explored the Talefre\r\nbasin, its cascade, and the ice beneath it. Several days were spent amid\r\nthe ice humps and cliffs at the lower portion of the fall. I suppose I\r\ntraversed the Glacier du Geant twenty times, and passed eight or ten\r\ndays amid the confusion of its great cascade. I visited those places\r\nwhere, it had been affirmed, the veins were produced. I endeavoured to\r\nsatisfy myself of the mutability which had been ascribed to them; but a\r\nclose examination reduced the value of each particular case so much that\r\nI quitted the glacier that year with nothing more than an _opinion_ that\r\nthe structure and the stratification were two different things. I,\r\nhowever, drew up a statement of the facts observed, with the view of\r\npresenting it to the Royal Society; but I afterwards felt that in thus\r\nacting I should merely swell the literature of the subject without\r\nadding anything certain. I therefore withheld the paper, and resolved\r\nto devote another year to a search among the chief glaciers of the\r\nOberland, of the Canton Valais, and of Savoy, for proofs which should\r\nrelieve my mind of all doubt upon the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXPEDITION FOR THIS PURPOSE.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly in 1858 I visited the glaciers of Rosenlaui, Schwartzwald,\r\nGrindelwald, the Aar, the Rhone, and the Aletsch, to the examination of\r\nwhich latter I devoted more than a week. I afterwards went to Zermatt,\r\nand, taking up my quarters at the Riffelberg, devoted eleven days to the\r\nexamination of the great system of glaciers of Monte Rosa. I explored\r\nthe Goerner Glacier up almost to the Cima de Jazzi; and believed that in\r\nit I could trace the structure from portions of the glacier where it\r\nvanished, through various stages of perfection, up to its full\r\ndevelopment. I believe this still; but yet it is nothing but a belief,\r\nwhich the utmost labour that I could bestow did not raise to a\r\ncertainty. The Western glacier of Monte Rosa, the Schwartze Glacier, the\r\nTrifti Glacier, the glacier of the little Mont Cervin, and of St.\r\nTheodule, were all examined in connexion with the great trunk-stream of\r\nthe Goerner, to which they weld themselves; and though the more I pursued\r\nthe subject the stronger my conviction became that pressure was the\r\ncause of the structure, a crucial case was still wanting.\r\n\r\nIn the phenomena of slaty cleavage, it is often, if not usually, found\r\nthat the true cleavage _cuts_ the planes of stratification--sometimes at\r\na very high angle. Had this not been proved by the observations of\r\nSedgwick and others, geologists would not have been able to conclude\r\nthat cleavage and bedding were two different things, and needed wholly\r\ndifferent explanations. My aim, throughout the expedition of 1858, was\r\nto discover in the ice a parallel case to the above; to find a clear and\r\nundoubted instance where the veins and the stratification were\r\nsimultaneously exhibited, cutting each other at an unmistakable angle.\r\nOn the 6th of August, while engaged with Professor Ramsay upon the\r\nGreat Aletsch Glacier, not far from its junction with the Middle\r\nAletsch, I observed what appeared to me to be the lines of bedding\r\nrunning nearly horizontal along the wall of a great crevasse, while\r\ncutting them at a large angle was the true veined structure. I drew my\r\nfriend's attention to the fact, and to him it appeared perfectly\r\nconclusive. It is from a sketch made by him at the place that Fig. 44\r\nhas been taken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CASE OF STRUCTURE ON THE ALETSCH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Structure and bedding on the Great Aletsch\r\nGlacier.]\r\n\r\nThis was the only case of the kind which I observed upon the Aletsch\r\nGlacier; and as I afterwards spent day after day upon the Monte Rosa\r\nglaciers, vainly seeking a similar instance, the thought again haunted\r\nme that we might have been mistaken upon the Aletsch. In this state of\r\nmind I remained until the 18th of August, a day devoted to the\r\nexamination of the Furgge Glacier, which lies at the base of the Mont\r\nCervin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE OF THE FURGGE GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nCrossing the valley of the Goerner Glacier, and taking a plunge as I\r\npassed into the Schwarze See, I reached, in good time, the object of my\r\nday's excursion. Walking up the glacier, I at length found myself\r\nopposed by a frozen cascade composed of four high terraces of ice. The\r\nhighest of these was chiefly composed of ice-cliffs and _seracs_, many\r\nof which had fallen, and now stood like rocking-stones upon the edge of\r\nthe second terrace. The glacier at the base of the cascade was strewn\r\nwith broken ice, and some blocks two hundred cubic feet in volume had\r\nbeen cast to a considerable distance down the glacier.\r\n\r\nUpon the faces of the terraces the stratification of the _neve_ was most\r\nbeautifully shown, running in parallel and horizontal lines along the\r\nweathered surface. The snow-field above the cascade is a frozen plain,\r\nsmooth almost as a sheltered lake. The successive snow-falls deposit\r\nthemselves with great regularity, and at the summit of the cascade the\r\nsections of the _neve_ are for the first time exposed. Hence their\r\npeculiar beauty and definition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ICE TERRACE EXAMINED.]\r\n\r\nIndeed the figure of a lake pouring itself over a rocky barrier which\r\ncurves convexly upwards, thus causing the water to fall down it, not\r\nonly longitudinally over the vertex of the curve, but laterally over its\r\ntwo arms, will convey a tolerably correct conception of the shape of the\r\nfall. Towards the centre the ice was powerfully squeezed laterally, the\r\nbeds were bent, and their continuity often broken by faults. On\r\ninspecting the ice from a distance with my opera glass, I thought I saw\r\nstructural groovings cutting the strata at almost a right angle. Had the\r\nquestion been an undisputed one, I should perhaps have felt so sure of\r\nthis as not to incur the danger of pushing the inquiry further; but,\r\nunder the circumstances, danger was a secondary point. Resigning,\r\ntherefore, my glass to my guide, who was to watch the tottering blocks\r\noverhead, and give me warning should they move, I advanced to the base\r\nof the fall, removed with my hatchet the weathered surface of the ice,\r\nand found underneath it the true veined structure, cutting, at nearly a\r\nright angle, the planes of stratification. The superficial groovings\r\nwere not uniformly distributed over the fall, but appeared most decided\r\nat those places where the ice appeared to have been most squeezed. I\r\nexamined three or four of these places, and in each case found the true\r\nveins nearly vertical, while the bedding was horizontal. Having\r\nperfectly satisfied myself of these facts, I made a speedy retreat, for\r\nthe ice-blocks seemed most threatening, and the sunny hour was that at\r\nwhich they fall most frequently.\r\n\r\nI next tried the ascent of the glacier up a dislocated declivity to the\r\nright. The ice was much riven, but still practicable. My way for a time\r\nlay amid fissures which exposed magnificent sections, and every step I\r\ntook added further demonstration to what I had observed below. The\r\nstrata were perfectly distinct, the structure equally so, and one\r\ncrossed the other at an angle of seventy or eighty degrees. Mr. Sorby\r\nhas adduced a case of the crumpling of a bed of sandstone through which\r\nthe cleavage passes: here on the glacier I had parallel cases; the beds\r\nwere bent and crumpled, but the structure ran through the ice in sharp\r\nstraight lines. This perhaps was the most pleasant day I ever spent upon\r\nthe glaciers: my mind was relieved of a long brooding doubt, and the\r\nintellectual freedom thus obtained added a subjective grandeur to the\r\nnoble scene before me. Climbing the cliffs near the base of the\r\nMatterhorn, I walked along the rocky spine which extends to the Hoernli,\r\nand afterwards descended by the valley of Zmutt to Zermatt.\r\n\r\nA year after my return to England a remark contained in Professor\r\nMousson's interesting little work 'Die Gletscher der Jetzzeit' caused me\r\nto refer to the atlas of M. Agassiz's 'Systeme Glaciaire,' from which I\r\nlearned that this indefatigable observer had figured a case of\r\nstratification and structure cutting each other. If, however, I had seen\r\nthis figure beforehand, it would not have changed my movements; for the\r\ncase, as sketched, would not have convinced me. I have now no doubt that\r\nM. Agassiz has preceded me in this observation, and hence my results\r\nare to be taken as mere confirmations of his.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LAMINATION AND STRATIFICATION.]\r\n\r\nFig. 45 represents a crumpled portion of the ice with the lines of\r\nlamination passing through the strata. Fig. 46 represents a case where a\r\nfault had occurred, the veins at both sides of the line of dislocation\r\nbeing inclined towards each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.

C.\r\nT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] In reply to a question in connexion with this subject, General\r\nSabine has favoured me with the following note:--\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\n     \"It was in the summer of 1841, at the Lower Grindelwald\r\n     Glacier, that I first saw, and was greatly impressed and\r\n     interested by examining and endeavouring to understand (in\r\n     which I did not succeed), the veined structure of the ice. I do\r\n     not remember when I mentioned it to Forbes, but it must be\r\n     before 1843, because it is noticed in his book, p. 29. I had\r\n     never observed it in the glaciers of Spitzbergen or Baffin's\r\n     Bay, or in the icebergs of the shores and straits of Davis or\r\n     Barrow. I feel the more confident of this, because, when I\r\n     first saw the veined structure in Switzerland, my Arctic\r\n     experience was more fresh in my recollection, and I recollected\r\n     nothing like it.\r\n\r\n     \"_Veins_ are indeed not uncommon in icebergs, but they quite\r\n     resemble veins in rocks, and are formed by water filling\r\n     fissures and freezing into blue ice, finely contrasted with the\r\n     white granular substance of the berg.\r\n\r\n     \"The ice of the Grindelwald Glacier (where I examined the\r\n     veined structure) was broken up into very large masses, which\r\n     by pressure had been upturned, so that a very poor judgment\r\n     would be formed of the direction of the veins as they existed\r\n     in the glacier before it had broken up.\r\n\r\n                                        \"Sincerely yours,\r\n                                        \"EDWARD SABINE.\r\n\r\n     \"_Feb. 20, 1860_.\"\r\n\r\n[B] In a letter to myself, published in the 17th volume of the\r\n'Philosophical Magazine,' Professor Forbes writes as follows:--\"In 1846,\r\nthen, I abandoned no part of the theory of the veined structure, on\r\nwhich as you say so much labour had been expended, except the admission,\r\nalways yielded with reluctance, and got rid of with satisfaction, that\r\nthe congelation of water in the crevices of the glacier may extend in\r\nwinter to a great depth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VEINED STRUCTURE AND THE DIFFERENTIAL MOTION.\r\n\r\n(28.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFERENTIAL MOTION GREATEST AT EDGES.]\r\n\r\nI have now to examine briefly the explanation of the structure which\r\nrefers it to differential motion--to a sliding of the particles of ice\r\npast each other, which leaves the traces of its existence in the blue\r\nveins. The fact is emphatically dwelt upon by those who hold this view,\r\nthat the structure is best developed nearest to the sides of the\r\nglacier, where the differential motion is greatest. Why the differential\r\nmotion is at its maximum near to the sides is easily understood. Let A\r\nB, C D, Fig. 47, represent the two sides of a glacier, moving in the\r\ndirection of the arrow, and let _m a b c n_ be a straight line of stakes\r\nset out across the glacier to-day. Six months hence this line, by the\r\nmotion of the ice downwards, will be bent to the form _m a' b' c' n_:\r\nthis curve will not be circular, it will be flattened in the middle; the\r\npoints _a_ and _c_, at some distance on each side of the centre _b_,\r\nmove in fact with nearly the same velocity as the centre itself. Not so\r\nwith the sides:--_a'_ and _c'_ have moved considerably in advance of _m_\r\nand _n_, and hence we say that the difference of motion, or the\r\ndifferential motion, of the particles of ice near to the side is a\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. Diagram illustrating Differential Motion.]\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the points _m a' b' c' n_ have been moving straight\r\ndown the glacier; and hence it will be understood that the sliding of\r\nthe parts past each other, or, in other words, the differential motion,\r\n_is parallel to the sides of the glacier_. This, indeed, is the only\r\ndifferential motion that experiment has ever established; and\r\nconsequently, when we find the best blue veins referred to the sides of\r\nthe glacier because the differential motion is there greatest, we\r\nnaturally infer that the motion meant is parallel to the sides.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE OBLIQUE TO SIDES.]\r\n\r\nBut the fact is, that this motion would not at all account for the blue\r\nveins, for they are not parallel to the sides, but _oblique_ to them.\r\nThis difficulty revealed itself after a time to those who first\r\npropounded the theory of differential motion, and caused them to modify\r\ntheir explanation of the structure. Differential motion is still assumed\r\nto be the cause of the veins, but now a motion is meant oblique to the\r\nsides, and it is supposed to be obtained in the following way:--Through\r\nthe quicker motion of the point _c'_ the ice between it and _n_ becomes\r\ndistended; that is to say, the line _c' n_ is in a state of\r\nstrain--there is a _drag_, it is said, oblique to the sides of the\r\nglacier; and it is therefore in this direction that the particles will\r\nbe caused to slide past each other. Dr. Whewell, who advocates this\r\nview, thus expounds it. He supposes the case of an alpine valley filled\r\nwith india-rubber which has been warmed until it has partially melted,\r\nor become viscous, and then asks, \"What will now be the condition of the\r\nmass? The sides and bottom will still be held back by the friction; the\r\nmiddle and upper part will slide forwards, but not freely. This want of\r\nfreedom in the motion (arising from the viscosity) will produce a drag\r\ntowards the middle of the valley, where the motion is freest; hence the\r\ndirection in which the filaments slide past each other will be obliquely\r\ndirected towards the middle. The sliding will separate the mass\r\naccording to such lines; and though new attachments will take place, the\r\nmass may be expected to retain the results of this separation in the\r\ntraces of parallel fissures.\"[A] Nothing can be clearer than the image\r\nof the process thus placed before the mind's eye.\r\n\r\nOne fact of especial importance is to be borne in mind: the sliding of\r\nfilaments which is thus supposed to take place oblique to the glacier\r\nhas never been proved; it is wholly assumed. A moraine, it is admitted,\r\nwill run parallel to the side of a glacier, or a block will move in the\r\nsame direction from beginning to end, without being sensibly drawn\r\ntowards the centre, but still it is supposed that the sliding of parts\r\nexists, though of a character so small as to render it insensible to\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE CROSSES LINES OF SLIDING.]\r\n\r\nMy chief difficulty as regards this theory may be expressed in a very\r\nfew words. If the structure be produced by differential motion, why is\r\nthe large and _real_ differential motion which experiments have\r\nestablished incompetent to produce it? And how can the veins run, as\r\nthey are admitted to do, _across the lines of maximum sliding_ from\r\ntheir origin throughout the glacier to its end?\r\n\r\nThat a drag towards the centre of the glacier exists is undeniable, but\r\nthat in consequence of the drag there is a sliding of filaments in this\r\ndirection, is quite another thing. I have in another place[B]\r\nendeavoured to show experimentally that no such sliding takes place,\r\nthat the drag on any point towards the centre expresses only half the\r\nconditions of the problem; being exactly neutralized by the thrust\r\ntowards the sides. It has been, moreover, shown by Mr. Hopkins that the\r\nlines of maximum strain and of maximum sliding cannot coincide; indeed,\r\nif all the particles be urged by the same force, no matter how strong\r\nthe pull may be, there will be no tendency of one to slide past the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] 'Philosophical Magazine,' Ser. III., vol. xxvi.\r\n\r\n[B] 'Proceedings of the Royal Institution,' vol. ii. p. 324.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIPPLE-THEORY OF THE VEINED STRUCTURE.\r\n\r\n(29.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEORY STATED.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEORY EXAMINED.]\r\n\r\nThe assumption of oblique sliding, and the production thereby of the\r\nmarginal structure, have, however, been fortified by considerations of\r\nan ingenious and very interesting kind. \"How,\" I have asked, \"can the\r\noblique structure persist across the lines of greatest differential\r\nmotion throughout the length of the glacier?\" But here I am met by\r\nanother question which at first sight might seem equally\r\nunanswerable--\"How do ripple-marks on the surface of a flowing river,\r\nwhich are nothing else than lines of differential motion of a low order,\r\ncross the river from the sides obliquely, while the direction of\r\ngreatest differential motion is parallel to the sides?\" If I understand\r\naright, this is the main argument of Professor Forbes in favour of his\r\ntheory of the oblique marginal structure. It is first introduced in a\r\nnote at page 378 of his 'Travels;' he alludes to it in a letter written\r\nthe following year; in his paper in the 'Philosophical Transactions' he\r\ndevelops the theory. He there gives drawings of ripple-marks observed in\r\nsmooth gutters after rain, and which he finds to be inclined to the\r\ncourse of the stream, exactly as the marginal structure is inclined to\r\nthe side of the glacier. The explanation also embraces the case of an\r\nobstacle placed in the centre of a river. \"A case,\" writes Professor\r\nForbes, \"parallel to the last mentioned, where a fixed obstacle cleaves\r\na descending stream, and leaves its trace in a fan-shaped tail, is well\r\nknown in several glaciers, as in that at Ferpecle, and the Glacier de\r\nLys on the south side of Monte Rosa; particularly the last, where the\r\nveined structure follows the law just mentioned.\" In his Twelfth Letter\r\nhe also refers to the ripples \"as exactly corresponding to the position\r\nof the icy bands.\" In his letter to Dr. Whewell, published in the\r\n'Occasional Papers,' page 58, he writes as follows:--\"The same is\r\nremarkably shown in the case of a stream of water, for instance a\r\nmill-race. Although the movement of the water, as shown by floating\r\nbodies, is exceedingly nearly (for small velocities sensibly) parallel\r\nto the sides, yet the variation of the speed from the side to the centre\r\nof the stream occasions a _ripple_, or molecular discontinuity, which\r\ninclines forwards from the sides to the centre of the stream at an angle\r\nwith the axis depending on the ratio of the central and lateral\r\nvelocity. The veined structure of the ice corresponds to the ripple of\r\nthe water, a molecular discontinuity whose measure is not comparable to\r\nthe actual velocity of the ice; and therefore the general movement of\r\nthe glacier, as indicated by the moraines, remains sensibly parallel to\r\nthe sides.\" This theory opens up to us a series of interesting and novel\r\nconsiderations which I think will repay the reader's attention. If the\r\nripples in the water and the veins in the ice be due to the same\r\nmechanical cause, when we develop clearly the origin of the former we\r\nare led directly to the explanation of the latter. I shall now endeavour\r\nto reduce the ripples to their mechanical elements.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Weber have described in their 'Wellenlehre' an effect of\r\nwave-motion which it is very easy to obtain. When a boat moves through\r\nperfectly smooth water, and the rower raises his oar out of the water,\r\ndrops trickle from its blade, and each drop where it falls produces a\r\nsystem of concentric rings. The circular waves as they widen become\r\ndepressed, and, if the drops succeed each other with sufficient speed,\r\nthe rings cross each other at innumerable points. The effect of this is\r\nto blot out more or less completely all the circles, and to leave\r\nbehind two straight divergent ripple-lines, which are tangents to all\r\nthe external rings; being in fact formed by the intersections of the\r\nlatter, as a caustic in optics is formed by the intersection of luminous\r\nrays. Fig. 48, which is virtually copied from M. Weber, will render this\r\ndescription at once intelligible. The boat is supposed to move in the\r\ndirection of the arrow, and as it does so the rings which it leaves\r\nbehind widen, and produce the divergence of the two straight resultant\r\nlines of ripple.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RIPPLES DEDUCED FROM RINGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. Diagram explanatory of the formation of\r\nRipples.]\r\n\r\nThe more quickly the drops succeed each other, the more frequent will be\r\nthe intersections of the rings; but as the speed of succession augments\r\nwe approach the case of _a continuous vein_ of liquid; and if we suppose\r\nthe continuity to be perfectly established, the ripples will still be\r\nproduced with a smooth space between them as before. This experiment may\r\nindeed be made with a well-wetted oar, which on its first emergence from\r\nthe water sends into it a continuous liquid vein. The same effect is\r\nproduced when we substitute for the stream of liquid a solid rod--a\r\ncommon walking-stick for example. A water-fowl swimming in calm water\r\nproduces two divergent lines of ripples of a similar kind.\r\n\r\nWe have here supposed the water of the lake to be at rest, and the\r\nliquid vein or the solid rod to move through it; but precisely the same\r\neffect is produced if we suppose the rod at rest and the liquid in\r\nmotion. Let a post, for example, be fixed in the middle of a flowing\r\nriver; diverging from that post right and left we shall have lines of\r\nripples exactly as if the liquid were at rest and the post moved through\r\nit with the velocity of the river. If the same post be placed close to\r\nthe bank, so that _one_ of its edges only shall act upon the water,\r\ndiverging from that edge we shall have a _single_ line of ripples which\r\nwill cross the river obliquely towards its centre. It is manifest that\r\nany other obstacle will produce the same effect as our hypothetical\r\npost. In the words of Professor Forbes, \"the slightest prominence of any\r\nkind in the wall of such a conduit, a bit of wood or a tuft of grass, is\r\nsufficient to produce a well-marked ripple-streak from the side towards\r\nthe centre.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEASURE OF DIVERGENCE OF RIPPLES.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations show that the divergence of the two lines\r\nof ripples from the central post, and of the single line in the case of\r\nthe lateral post, have their mechanical element, if I may use the term,\r\nin the experiment of the Messrs. Weber. In the case of a swimming duck\r\nthe connexion between the diverging lines of ripples and the propagation\r\nof rings round a disturbed point is often very prettily shown. When the\r\ncreature swims with vigour the little foot with which it strikes the\r\nwater often comes sufficiently near to the surface to produce an\r\nelevation,--sometimes indeed emerging from the water altogether. Round\r\nthe point thus disturbed rings are immediately propagated, and the\r\nwidening of those rings is _the exact measure of the divergence of the\r\nripple lines_. The rings never cross the lines;--the lines never retreat\r\nfrom the rings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RIPPLES AND VEINS DUE TO DIFFERENT CAUSES.]\r\n\r\nIf we compare the mechanical actions here traced out with those which\r\ntake place upon a glacier, I think it will be seen that the analogy\r\nbetween the ripples and the veined structure is entirely superficial.\r\nHow the structure ascribed to the Glacier de Lys is to be explained I do\r\nnot know, for I have never seen it; but it seems impossible that it\r\ncould be produced, as ripples are, by a fixed obstacle which \"cleaves a\r\ndescending stream.\" No one surely will affirm that glacier-ice so\r\nclosely resembles a fluid as to be capable of transmitting undulations,\r\nas water propagates rings round a disturbed point. The difficulty of\r\nsuch a supposition would be augmented by taking into account the motion\r\nof the _individual liquid particles_ which go to form a ripple; for the\r\nMessrs. Weber have shown that these move in closed curves, describing\r\norbits more or less circular. Can it be supposed that the particles of\r\nice execute a motion of this kind? If so, their orbital motions may be\r\neasily calculated, being deducible from the motion of the glacier\r\ncompounded with the inclination of the veins. If so important a result\r\ncould be established, all glacier theories would vanish in comparison\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POSITION OF RIPPLES NOT THAT OF STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\nThere is another interesting point involved in the passage above quoted.\r\nProfessor Forbes considers that the ripple is occasioned by the\r\nvariation of speed from the side to the centre of the stream, and that\r\nits _inclination_ depends on the ratio of the central and lateral\r\nvelocity. If I am correct in the above analysis, this cannot be the\r\ncase. The inclination of the ripple depends solely on the ratio of the\r\nriver's translatory motion to the velocity of its wave-motion. Were the\r\nlateral and central velocities alike, a momentary disturbance at the\r\nside would produce a _straight_ ripple-mark, whose inclination would be\r\ncompounded of the two elements just mentioned. If the motion of the\r\nwater vary from side to centre, the velocity of wave-propagation\r\nremaining constant, the inclination of the ripple will also vary, that\r\nis to say, we shall have a _curved_ ripple instead of a straight one.\r\nThis, of course, is the case which we find in Nature, but the curvature\r\nof such ripples is totally different from that of the veined structure.\r\nOwing to the quicker translatory movement, the ripples, as they approach\r\nthe centre, tend more to parallelism with the direction of the river;\r\nand after having passed the centre, and reached the slower water near\r\nthe opposite side, their inclination to the axis gradually augments.\r\nThus the ripples from the two sides form a pair of symmetric curves,\r\nwhich cross each other at the centre, and possess the form _a o b_, _c o\r\nd_, shown in Fig. 49. A similar pair of curves would be produced by the\r\nreflection of these. Knowing the variation of motion from side to\r\ncentre, any competent mathematician could find the equation of the\r\nripple-curves; but it would be out of place for me to attempt it here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. Diagram explanatory of the formation of\r\nRipples.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VEINED STRUCTURE AND PRESSURE.\r\n\r\n(30.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a prism of glass be pressed by a sufficient weight, the particles in\r\nthe line of pressure will be squeezed more closely together, while those\r\nat right angles to this line will be forced further apart. The existence\r\nof this state of strain may be demonstrated by the action of such\r\nsqueezed glass upon polarised light. It gives rise to colours, and it is\r\neven possible to infer from the tint the precise amount of pressure to\r\nwhich the glass is subjected. M. Wertheim indeed has most ably applied\r\nthese facts to the construction of a dynamometer, or instrument for\r\nmeasuring pressures, exceeding in accuracy any hitherto devised.\r\n\r\nWhen the pressure applied becomes too great for the glass to sustain, it\r\nflies to pieces. But let us suppose the sides of the prism defended by\r\nan extremely strong jacket, in which the prism rests like a\r\nclosely-fitting plug, and which yields only when a pressure more than\r\nsufficient to crush the glass is applied. Let the pressure be gradually\r\naugmented until this point is attained; afterwards both the glass and\r\nits jacket will shorten and widen; the jacket will yield laterally,\r\nbeing pushed out with extreme slowness by the glass within.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POSSIBLE EXPERIMENT WITH GLASS PRISM.]\r\n\r\nNow I believe that it would be possible to make this experiment in such\r\na manner that the glass should be _flattened_, partly through rupture,\r\nand partly through lateral molecular yielding; the prism would change\r\nits form, and yet present a firmly coherent mass when removed from its\r\njacket. I have never made the experiment; nobody has, as far as I know;\r\nbut experiments of this kind are often made by Nature. In the Museum of\r\nthe Government School of Mines, for example, we have a collection of\r\nquartz stones placed there by Mr. Salter, and which have been subjected\r\nto enormous pressure in the neighbourhood of a fault. These rigid\r\npebbles have, in some cases, been squeezed against each other so as to\r\nproduce mutual flattening and indentation. Some of them have yielded\r\nalong planes passing through them, as if one half had slidden over the\r\nother; but the reattachment is very strong. Some of the larger stones,\r\nmoreover, which have endured pressure at a particular point, are\r\nfissured radially around this point. In short, the whole collection is a\r\nmost instructive example of the manner and extent to which one of the\r\nmost rigid substances in Nature can yield on the application of a\r\nsufficient force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POSSIBLE EXPERIMENT WITH PRISM OF ICE.]\r\n\r\nLet a prism of ice at 32 deg. be placed in a similar jacket to that which we\r\nhave supposed to envelop the glass prism. The ice yields to the pressure\r\nwith incomparably greater ease than the glass; and if the force be\r\nslowly applied, the lateral yielding will far more closely resemble that\r\nof a truly plastic body. Supposing such a piece of ice to be filled with\r\nnumerous small air-bubbles, the tendency of the pressure would be to\r\nflatten these bubbles, and to squeeze them out of the ice. Were the\r\nsubstance perfectly homogeneous, this flattening and expulsion would\r\ntake place uniformly throughout its entire mass; but I believe there is\r\nno such homogeneous substance in nature;--the ice will yield at\r\ndifferent places, leaving between them spaces which are comparatively\r\nunaffected by the pressure. From the former spaces the air-bubbles will\r\nbe more effectually expelled; and I have no doubt that the result of\r\nsuch pressure acting upon ice so protected would be to produce a\r\nlaminated structure somewhat similar to that which it produces in those\r\nbodies which exhibit slaty cleavage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LAMINATION PRODUCED BY PRESSURE.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NO SLIDING OF FILAMENTS.]\r\n\r\nI also think it certain that, in this lateral displacement of the\r\nparticles, these must move past each other. This is an idea which I\r\nhave long entertained, as the following passage taken from the paper\r\npublished by Mr. Huxley and myself will prove:--\"Three principal causes\r\nmay operate in producing cleavage: first, the reducing of surfaces of\r\nweak cohesion to parallel planes; second, the flattening of minute\r\ncavities; and third, the weakening of cohesion by tangential action. The\r\nthird action is exemplified by the state of the rails near a station\r\nwhere a break is habitually applied to a locomotive. In this case, while\r\nthe weight of the train presses vertically, its motion tends to cause\r\nlongitudinal sliding of the particles of the rail. Tangential action\r\ndoes not, however, necessarily imply a force of the latter kind. When a\r\nsolid cylinder an inch in height is squeezed to a vertical cake a\r\nquarter of an inch in height, it is impossible, physically speaking,\r\nthat the particles situated in the same vertical line shall move\r\nlaterally with the same velocity; but if they do not, the cohesion\r\nbetween them will be weakened or ruptured. The pressure, however, will\r\nproduce new contact; and if this have a cohesive value equal to that of\r\nthe old contact, no cleavage from this cause can arise. The relative\r\ncapacities of different substances for cleavage appear to depend in a\r\ngreat measure upon their different properties in this respect. In\r\nbutter, for example, the new attachments are equal, or nearly so, to the\r\nold, and the cleavage is consequently indistinct; in wax this does not\r\nappear to be the case, and hence may arise in a great degree the\r\nperfection of its cleavage. The further examination of this subject\r\npromises interesting results.\" I would dwell upon this point the more\r\ndistinctly as the advocates of differential motion may deem it to be in\r\ntheir favour; but it appears to me that the mechanical conceptions\r\nimplied in the above passage are totally different from theirs. If they\r\nthink otherwise, then it seems to me that they should change the\r\nexpressions which refer the differential motion to a \"drag\" towards the\r\ncentre, and the structure to the sliding of \"filaments\" past each other\r\nin consequence of this drag. Such filamentary sliding may take place in\r\na truly viscous body, but it does not take place in ice.\r\n\r\nIn one particular the ice resembles the butter referred to in the above\r\nquotation; for its new attachments appear to be equal to the old, and\r\nthis, I think, is to be ascribed to its perfect regelation. As justly\r\npointed out by Mr. John Ball, the veined ice of a glacier, if\r\nunweathered, shows no tendency to cleave; for though the expulsion of\r\nthe air-bubbles has taken place, the reattachment of the particles is so\r\nfirm as to abolish all evidence of cleavage. When the ice, on the\r\ncontrary, is weathered, the plates become detached, and I have often\r\nbeen able to split such ice into thin tablets having an area of two or\r\nthree square feet.\r\n\r\nIn his Thirteenth Letter Professor Forbes throws out a new and possibly\r\na pregnant thought in connexion with the veins. If I understand him\r\naright--and I confess it is usually a matter of extreme difficulty with\r\nme to make sure of this--he there refers the veins, not to the expulsion\r\nof the air from the ice, but to its redistribution. The pressure\r\nproduces \"_lines of tearing_ in which the air is distributed in the form\r\nof regular globules.\" I do not know what might be made of this idea if\r\nit were developed, but at present I do not see how the supposed action\r\ncould produce the blue bands; and I agree with Professor Wm. Thomson in\r\nregarding the explanation as improbable.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] For an extremely ingenious view of the origin of the veined\r\nstructure, I would refer to a paper by Professor Thomson, in the\r\n'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' April, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VEINED STRUCTURE AND THE LIQUEFACTION OF ICE BY PRESSURE.\r\n\r\n(31.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already noticed an important fact for which we are indebted to\r\nMr. James Thomson, and have referred to the original communications on\r\nthe subject. I shall here place the physical circumstances connected\r\nwith this fact before my reader in the manner which I deem most likely\r\nto interest him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INFLUENCE OF PRESSURE ON BOILING POINT.]\r\n\r\nWhen a liquid is heated, the attraction of the molecules operates\r\nagainst the action of the heat, which tends to tear them asunder. At a\r\ncertain point the force of heat triumphs, the cohesion is overcome, and\r\nthe liquid boils. But supposing we assist the attraction of the\r\nmolecules by applying an external pressure, the difficulty of tearing\r\nthem asunder will be increased; more heat will be required for this\r\npurpose; and hence we say that the _boiling point_ of the liquid has\r\nbeen _elevated_ by the pressure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INFLUENCE OF PRESSURE ON FUSING POINT.]\r\n\r\nIf molten sulphur be poured into a bullet-mould, it will be found on\r\ncooling to contract, so as to leave a large hollow space in the middle\r\nof each sphere. Cast musket-bullets are thus always found to possess a\r\nsmall cavity within them produced by the contraction of the lead.\r\nConceive the bullet placed within its mould and the latter heated; to\r\nproduce fusion it is necessary that the sulphur or the lead should\r\n_swell_. Here, as in the case of the heated water, the tendency to\r\nexpand is opposed by the attraction of the molecules; with a certain\r\namount of heat however this attraction is overcome and the solid\r\n_melts_. But suppose we assist the molecular attraction by a suitable\r\nforce applied externally, a greater amount of heat than before will be\r\nnecessary to tear them asunder; and hence we say that the _fusing\r\npoint_ has been _elevated_ by the pressure. This fact has been\r\nexperimentally established by Messrs. Hopkins and Fairbairn, who applied\r\nto spermaceti and other substances pressures so great as to raise their\r\npoints of fusion a considerable number of degrees.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the case of the metal bismuth. If the molten metal\r\nbe poured into a bullet-mould it will _expand_ on solidifying. I have\r\nmyself filled a strong cast-iron bottle with the metal, and found its\r\nexpansion on cooling sufficiently great to split the bottle from neck to\r\nbottom. Hence, in order to fuse the bismuth the substance must\r\n_contract_; and it is manifest that an external pressure which tends to\r\nsqueeze the molecules more closely together here _assists_ the heat\r\ninstead of opposing it. Hence, to fuse bismuth under great pressure, a\r\nless amount of heat will be required than when the pressure is removed;\r\nor, in other words, the fusing point of bismuth is _lowered_ by the\r\npressure. Now, in passing from the solid to the liquid state, _ice_,\r\nlike bismuth, contracts, and if the contraction be promoted by external\r\npressure, as shown by the Messrs. Thomson, a less amount of heat\r\nsuffices to liquefy it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXPERIMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThese remarks will enable us to understand a singular effect first\r\nobtained by myself at the close of 1856 or in January 1857, noticed at\r\nthe time in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' and afterwards fully\r\ndescribed in a paper presented to the Society in December of that year.\r\nA cylinder of clear ice two inches high and an inch in diameter was\r\nplaced between two slabs of box-wood, and subjected to a gradual\r\npressure. I watched the ice in a direction perpendicular to its length,\r\nand saw cloudy lines drawing themselves across it. As the pressure\r\ncontinued, these lines augmented in numbers, until finally the prism\r\npresented the appearance of a crystal of gypsum whose planes of cleavage\r\nhad been forced out of optical contact. When looked at obliquely it was\r\nfound that the lines were merely the sections of flat dim surfaces,\r\nwhich lay like laminae one over the other throughout the length of the\r\nprism. Fig. 50 represents the prism as it appeared when looked at in a\r\ndirection perpendicular to its axis; Fig. 51 shows the appearance when\r\nviewed obliquely.[A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50, 51. Appearance of a prism of ice partially\r\nliquefied by Pressure.]\r\n\r\nAt first sight it might appear as if air had intruded itself between the\r\nseparated surfaces of the ice, and to test this point I placed a\r\ncylinder two inches long and an inch wide upright in a copper vessel\r\nwhich was filled with ice-cold water. The ice cylinder rose about half\r\nan inch above the surface of the water. Placing the copper vessel on a\r\nslab of wood, and a second slab on the top of the cylinder of ice, the\r\nlatter was subjected to the gradual action of a small hydraulic press.\r\nWhen the hazy surfaces were well developed in the portion of the ice\r\nabove the water, the cylinder was removed and examined: the planes of\r\nrupture extended throughout the entire length of the cylinder, just as\r\nif it had been squeezed in air. I subsequently placed the ice in a stout\r\nvessel of glass, and squeezed it, as in the last experiment: the\r\nsurfaces of discontinuity were seen forming _under the liquid_ quite as\r\ndistinctly as in air.\r\n\r\nTo prove that the surfaces were due to compression and not to any\r\ntearing asunder of the mass by tension, the following experiment was\r\nmade:--A cylindrical piece of ice, one of whose ends, however, was not\r\nparallel to the other, was placed between the slabs of wood, and\r\nsubjected to pressure. Fig. 52 shows the disposition of the experiment.\r\nThe effect upon the ice cylinder was that shown in Fig. 53, the surfaces\r\nbeing developed along that side which had suffered the pressure. On\r\nexamining the surfaces by a pocket lens they resembled the effect\r\nproduced upon a smooth cold surface by breathing on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52, 53. Figures illustrative of compression and\r\nliquefaction of ice.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIQUID LAYERS PRODUCED BY PRESSURE.]\r\n\r\nThe surfaces were always dim; and had the spaces been filled with air,\r\nor were they simply vacuous, the reflection of light from them would\r\nhave been so copious as to render them much more brilliant than they\r\nwere observed to be. To examine them more particularly I placed a\r\nconcave mirror so as to throw the diffused daylight from a window full\r\nupon the cylinder. On applying the pressure dim spots were sometimes\r\nseen forming in the very middle of the ice, and these as they expanded\r\nlaterally appeared to be in a state of intense motion, which followed\r\nclosely the edge of each surface as it advanced through the solid ice.\r\nOnce or twice I observed the hazy surfaces pioneered through the mass by\r\ndim offshoots, apparently liquid, and constituting a kind of\r\ndecrystallisation. From the closest examination to which I was able to\r\nsubject them, the surfaces appeared to me to be due to internal\r\nliquefaction; indeed, when the melting point of ice, having already a\r\ntemperature of 32 deg., is lowered by pressure, its excess of heat must\r\ninstantly be applied to produce this effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APPLICATION TO THE VEINED STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\nI have already given a drawing (p. 386) showing the development of the\r\nveined structure at the base of the ice-cascade of the Rhone; and if we\r\ncompare that diagram with Fig. 53 a striking similarity at once reveals\r\nitself. The ice of the glacier must undoubtedly be liquefied to some\r\nextent by the tremendous pressure to which it is here subjected.\r\nSurfaces of discontinuity will in all probability be formed, which\r\nfacilitate the escape of the imprisoned air. The small quantity of water\r\nproduced will be partly imbibed by the adjacent porous ice, and will be\r\nrefrozen when relieved from the pressure. This action, associated with\r\nthat ascribed to pressure in the last section, appears to me to furnish\r\na complete physical explanation of the laminated structure of\r\nglacier-ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] This effect projected upon a screen is a most striking and\r\ninstructive class experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ICE-SEAMS IN THE GLACIER DU GEANT.\r\n\r\n(32.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENERAL APPEARANCE OF WHITE ICE-SEAMS.]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July, 1857, while engaged upon the Glacier du Geant, my\r\nattention was often attracted by protuberant ridges of what at first\r\nappeared to be pure white snow, but which on examination I found to be\r\ncompact ice filled with innumerable round air-cells; and which, in\r\nvirtue of its greater power of resistance to wasting, often rose to a\r\nheight of three or four feet above the general level of the ice. As I\r\nstood amongst these ridges, they appeared detached and without order of\r\narrangement, but looked at from a distance they were seen to sweep\r\nacross the proper Glacier du Geant in a direction concentric with its\r\ndirt-bands and its veined structure. In some cases the seams were\r\nadmirable indications of the relative displacement of two adjacent\r\nportions of the glacier, which were divided from each other by a\r\ncrevasse. Usually the sections of a seam exposed on the opposite sides\r\nof a fissure accurately faced each other, and the direction of the seam\r\non both sides was continuous; but at other places they demonstrated the\r\nexistence of lateral faults, being shifted asunder laterally through\r\nspaces varying from a few inches to six or seven feet.\r\n\r\nOn the following day I was again upon the same glacier, and noticed in\r\nmany cases the white ice-seams exquisitely honeycombed. The case was\r\nillustrative of the great difference between the absorptive power of the\r\nice itself and of the objects which lie upon its surface. Deep\r\ncylindrical cells were produced by spots of black dirt which had been\r\nscattered upon the surface of the white ice, and which sank to a depth\r\nof several inches into the mass. I examined several sections of the\r\nveins, and in general I found that their deeper portions blended\r\ngradually with the ice on either side of them. But higher up the glacier\r\nI found that the veins penetrated only to a limited depth, and did not\r\ntherefore form an integrant portion of the glacier. Figs. 54 and 55 show\r\nthe sections of two of the seams which were exposed on the wall of a\r\ncrevasse at some distance below the great ice-fall of the Glacier du\r\nGeant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SECTIONS OF SEAMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54, 55. Sections of White Ice-seams.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56. Variations in the Dip of the Veined Structure.]\r\n\r\nIt was at the base of the Talefre cascade that the explanation of these\r\ncurious seams presented itself to me. In one of my earliest visits to\r\nthis portion of the glacier I was struck by a singular disposition of\r\nthe blue veins on the vertical wall of a crevasse. Fig. 56 will\r\nillustrate what I saw. The veins, within a short distance, dipped\r\n_backward_ and _forward_, like the junctions of stones used to turn an\r\narch. In some cases I found this variation of the structure so great as\r\nto pass in a short distance from the vertical to the horizontal, as\r\nshown in Fig. 57.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VARIATIONS IN \"DIP\" OF STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. Variations in the Dip of the Veined Structure.]\r\n\r\nFurther examination taught me that the glacier here is crumpled in a\r\nmost singular manner; doubtless by the great pressure to which it is\r\nexposed. The following illustration will convey a notion of its aspect:\r\nLet one hand be laid flat upon a table, palm downwards, and let the\r\nfingers be bent until the space between the first joint and the ends of\r\nthe fingers is vertical; one of the crumples to which I refer will then\r\nbe represented. The ice seems bent like the fingers, and the crumples of\r\nthe glacier are cut by crevasses, which are accurately typified by the\r\nspaces between the fingers. Let the second hand now be placed upon the\r\nfirst, as the latter is upon the table, so that the tops of the bent\r\nfingers of the second hand shall rest upon the roots of the first: two\r\ncrumples would thus be formed; a series of such protuberances, with\r\nsteep fronts, follow each other from the base of the Talefre cascade for\r\nsome distance downwards.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the 1st of August I ascended these rounded terraces in\r\nsuccession, and observed among them an extremely remarkable disposition\r\nof the structure. Fig. 58 is a section of a series of three of the\r\ncrumples, on which the shading lines represent the direction of the blue\r\nveins. At the base of each protuberance I found a seam of white ice\r\nwedged firmly into the glacier, and _each of the seams marked a place of\r\ndislocation of the veins_. The white seams thinned off gradually, and\r\nfinally vanished where the violent crumpling of the ice disappeared. In\r\nFig. 59 I have sketched the wall of a crevasse, which represents what\r\nmay be regarded as the incipient crumpling. The undulating line shows\r\nthe contour of the surface, and the shading lines the veins. It will be\r\nobserved that the direction of the veins yields in conformity with the\r\nundulation of the surface; and an augmentation of the effect would\r\nevidently result in the crumples shown in Fig. 58. The appearance of the\r\nwhite seams at those places where a dislocation occurred was, as far as\r\nI could observe, invariable; but in a few instances the seams were\r\nobserved upon the platforms of the terraces, and also upon their slopes.\r\nThe width of a seam was very irregular, varying from a few inches at\r\nsome places to three or four feet at others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRUMPLES OF THE TALEFRE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. Section of three glacier Crumples.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. Wall of a crevasse, with incipient crumpling.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOULDS OF WHITE ICE-SEAMS.]\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of August I was again at the base of the Talefre cascade, and\r\nobserved a fact the significance of which had previously escaped me. The\r\nrills which ran down the ice-slopes collected at the base of each\r\nprotuberance into a stream, which, at the time of my visit, had hollowed\r\nout for itself a deep channel in the ice. At some places the stream\r\nwidened, at others its banks of ice approached each other, and rapids\r\nwere produced; in fact, _the channels of such streams appeared to be the\r\nexact moulds of the seams of white ice_.\r\n\r\nInstructed thus far, I ascended the Glacier du Geant on the 5th of\r\nAugust, and then observed on the wrinkles of this glacier the same\r\nleaning backwards and forwards of the blue veins as I had previously\r\nobserved upon the Talefre. I also noticed on this day that a seam of\r\nwhite ice would sometimes open out into two branches, which, after\r\nremaining for some distance separate, would reunite and thus enclose a\r\nlittle glacier-island. At other places lateral branches were thrown off\r\nfrom the principal seam, thus suggesting the form of a glacier-rivulet\r\nwhich had been fed by tributary branches. On the 7th of August I hunted\r\nthe seams still farther up the glacier; and found them at one place\r\ndescending a steep ice-hill, being crossed by other similar bands, which\r\nhowever were far less white and compact. I followed these new bands to\r\ntheir origin, and found it to be a system of crevasses formed at the\r\nsummit of the hill, some of which were filled with snow. Lower down the\r\ncrevasses closed, and the snow thus jammed between their walls was\r\nconverted into white ice. These seams, however, never attained the\r\ncompactness and prominence of the larger ones which had their origin far\r\nhigher up. I singled out one of the best of the latter, and traced it\r\nthrough all the dislocation and confusion of the ice, until I found it\r\nto terminate in a cavity filled with snow.\r\n\r\nThis was near the base of the _seracs_, and the streams here were\r\nabundant. Comparing the shapes of some of them with that of the\r\nice-bands lower down the glacier, a striking resemblance was observed.\r\nFig. 60 is the plan of a deep-cut channel through which a stream flowed\r\non the day to which I now refer. Fig. 61 is the plan of a seam of white\r\nice sketched on the same day, low down upon the glacier. Instances of\r\nthis kind might be multiplied; and the result, I think, renders it\r\ncertain that the white ice-seams referred to are due to the filling up\r\nof the channels of glacier-streams by snow during winter, and the\r\nsubsequent compression of the mass to ice during the descent of the\r\nglacier. I have found such seams at the bases of all cascades that I\r\nhave visited; and in all cases they appear to be due to the same cause.\r\nThe depth to which they penetrate the glacier must be profound, or the\r\n_ablation_ of the ice must be less than what is generally supposed; for\r\nthe seams formed so high up on the Glacier du Geant may be traced low\r\ndown upon the trunk-stream of the Mer de Glace.[A]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STREAMS AND SEAMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Plan of a Stream on the Glacier du Geant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. Plan of a Seam of White Ice on the Glacier du\r\nGeant.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCALING OFF BY PRESSURE.]\r\n\r\nThese observations on the white ice-seams enable us to add an important\r\nsupplement to what has been stated regarding the origin of the\r\ndirt-bands of the Mer de Glace; The protuberances at the base of the\r\ncascade are due not only to the toning down of the ridges produced by\r\nthe transverse fracture of the glacier at the summit of the fall, but\r\nthey undergo modifications by the pressure locally exerted at its base.\r\nThe state of things represented in Fig. 57 is plainly due to the partial\r\npushing of one crumple over that next in advance of it. There seems to\r\nbe a differential motion of the parts of the glacier in the same\r\nlongitudinal line; showing that upon the general motion of the glacier\r\nsmaller local motions are superposed. The occurrence of the seams upon\r\nthe faces of the slopes seems also to prove that the pressure is\r\ncompetent, in some cases, to cause the bases of the protuberances to\r\nswell, so that what was once the base of a crumple may subsequently form\r\na portion of its slope. Another interesting fact is also observed where\r\nthe pressure is violent: the crumples _scale off_, bows of ice being\r\nthus formed which usually span the crumples over their most violently\r\ncompressed portions. I have found this scaling off at the bases of all\r\nthe cascades which I have visited, and it is plainly due to the pressure\r\nexerted at such places upon the ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The more permanent seams may possibly be due to the filling of the\r\nprofound crevasses of the cascade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(33.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMPRESSION OF GLACIER DU GEANT.]\r\n\r\nNot only at the base of its great cascade, but throughout the greater\r\npart of its length, the Glacier du Geant is in a state of longitudinal\r\ncompression. The meaning of this term will be readily understood: Let\r\ntwo points, for example, be marked upon the axis of the glacier; if\r\nthese during its descent were drawn wider apart, it would show that the\r\nglacier was in a state of longitudinal strain or tension; if they\r\nremained at the same distance apart, it would indicate that neither\r\nstrain nor pressure was exerted; whereas, if the two points approached\r\neach other, which could only be by the quicker motion of the hinder\r\none, the existence of longitudinal compression would be thereby\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nTaking \"Le Petit Balmat\" with me, to carry my theodolite, I ascended the\r\nGlacier du Geant until I came near the place where it is joined by the\r\nGlacier des Periades, and whence I observed a patch of fresh green grass\r\nupon the otherwise rocky mountain-side. To this point I climbed, and\r\nmade it the station for my instrument. Choosing a well-defined object at\r\nthe opposite side of the glacier, I set, on the 9th of August, in the\r\nline between this object and the theodolite, three stakes, one in the\r\ncentre of the glacier, and the other two at opposite sides of the centre\r\nand about 100 yards from it. This done, I descended for a quarter of a\r\nmile, when I again climbed the flanking rocks, placing my theodolite in\r\na couloir, down which stones are frequently discharged from the end of a\r\nsecondary glacier which hangs upon the heights above. Here, as before, I\r\nfixed three stakes, chiselled a mark upon the granite, so as to enable\r\nme to find the place, and regained the ice without accident. A day or\r\ntwo previously we had set out a third line at some distance lower down,\r\nand I was thus furnished with a succession of points along the glacier,\r\nthe relative motions of which would decide whether it was _pressed_ or\r\n_stretched_ in the direction of its length. On the 10th of August Mr.\r\nHuxley joined us; and on the following day we all set out for the\r\nGlacier du Geant, to measure the progress of the stakes which I had\r\nfixed there. Hirst remained upon the glacier to measure the\r\ndisplacements; I shouldered the theodolite; and Huxley was my guide to\r\nthe mountain-side, sounding in advance of me the treacherous-looking\r\nsnow over which we had to pass.\r\n\r\nCalling the central stake of the highest line No. 1, that of the middle\r\nline No. 2, and that of the line nearest the Tacul No. 3, the following\r\nare the spaces moved over by these three points in twenty-four hours:\r\n\r\n              Inches.      Distances asunder.\r\n\r\n  No. 1        20.55\r\n                      }    545 yards.\r\n  No. 2        15.43\r\n                      }    487 yards.\r\n  No. 3        12.75\r\n\r\nHere we have the fact which the aspect of the glacier suggested. The\r\nfirst stake moves five inches a day more than the second, and the second\r\nnearly three inches a day more than the third. As surmised, therefore,\r\nthe glacier is in a state of longitudinal compression, whereby a portion\r\nof it 1000 yards in length is shortened at the rate of eight inches a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE IN WHITE ICE-SEAMS.]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this result, the transverse undulations of the\r\nGlacier du Geant, described in the chapter upon Dirt-Bands, _shorten_ as\r\nthey descend. A series of three of them measured along the axis of the\r\nglacier on the 6th of August, 1857, gave the following respective\r\nlengths:--955 links, 855 links, 770 links, the shortest undulation being\r\nthe farthest from the origin of the undulations. This glacier then\r\nconstitutes a vast ice-press, and enables us to test the explanation\r\nwhich refers the veined structure of the ice to pressure. The glacier\r\nitself is transversely laminated, as already stated; and in many cases a\r\nstructure of extreme definition and beauty is developed in the\r\ncompressed snow, which constitutes the seams of white ice. In 1857 I\r\ndiscovered a well-developed lenticular structure in some of these seams.\r\nIn 1858 I again examined them. Clearing away the superficial portions\r\nwith my axe, I found, drawn through the body of the seams, long lines of\r\nblue ice of exquisite definition; in fact, I had never seen the\r\nstructure so delicately exhibited. The seams, moreover, were developed\r\nin portions of the white ice which were near the _centre_ of the\r\nglacier, and where consequently filamentous sliding was entirely out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARTIAL SUMMARY.]\r\n\r\nPARTIAL SUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Glaciers are derived from mountain snow, which has been consolidated\r\nto ice by pressure.\r\n\r\n2. That pressure is competent to convert snow into ice has been proved\r\nby experiment.\r\n\r\n3. The power of yielding to pressure diminishes as the mass becomes more\r\ncompact; but it does not cease even when the substance has attained the\r\ncompactness which would entitle it to be called ice.\r\n\r\n4. When a sufficient depth of snow collects upon the earth's surface,\r\nthe lower portions are squeezed out by the pressure of the\r\nsuperincumbent mass. If it rests upon a slope it will yield principally\r\nin the direction of the slope, and move downwards.\r\n\r\n5. In addition to this, the whole mass slides bodily along its inclined\r\nbed, and leaves the traces of its sliding on the rocks over which it\r\npasses, grinding off their asperities, and marking them with grooves and\r\nscratches in the direction of the motion.\r\n\r\n6. In this way the deposit of consolidated and unconsolidated snow which\r\ncovers the higher portions of lofty mountains moves slowly down into an\r\nadjacent valley, through which it descends as a true glacier, partly by\r\nsliding and partly by the yielding of the mass itself.\r\n\r\n7. Several valleys thus filled may unite in a single valley, the\r\ntributary glaciers welding themselves together to form a trunk-glacier.\r\n\r\n8. Both the main valley and its tributaries are often sinuous, and the\r\ntributaries must change their direction to form the trunk; the width of\r\nthe valley often varies. The glacier is forced through narrow gorges,\r\nwidening after it has passed them; the centre of the glacier moves more\r\nquickly than the sides, and the surface more quickly than the bottom;\r\nthe point of swiftest motion follows the same law as that observed in\r\nthe flow of rivers, shifting from one side of the centre to the other as\r\nthe flexure of the valley changes.\r\n\r\n9. These various effects may be reproduced by experiments on small\r\nmasses of ice. The substance may moreover be moulded into vases and\r\nstatuettes. Straight bars of it may be bent into rings, or even coiled\r\ninto knots.\r\n\r\n10. Ice, capable of being thus moulded, is practically incapable of\r\nbeing stretched. The condition essential to success is that the\r\nparticles of the ice operated on shall be kept in close contact, so that\r\nwhen old attachments have been severed new ones may be established.\r\n\r\n11. The nearer the ice is to its melting point in temperature, the more\r\neasily are the above results obtained; when ice is many degrees below\r\nits freezing point it is crushed by pressure to a white powder, and is\r\nnot capable of being moulded as above.\r\n\r\n12. Two pieces of ice at 32 deg. Fahr., with moist surfaces, when placed in\r\ncontact freeze together to a rigid mass; this is called Regelation.\r\n\r\n13. When the attachments of pressed ice are broken, the continuity of\r\nthe mass is restored by the regelation of the new contiguous surfaces.\r\nRegelation also enables two tributary glaciers to weld themselves to\r\nform a continuous trunk; thus also the crevasses are mended, and the\r\ndislocations of the glacier consequent on descending cascades are\r\nrepaired. This healing of ruptures extends to the smallest particles of\r\nthe mass, and it enables us to account for the continued compactness of\r\nthe ice during the descent of the glacier.\r\n\r\n14. The quality of viscosity is practically absent in glacier-ice. Where\r\npressure comes into play the phenomena are suggestive of viscosity, but\r\nwhere tension comes into play the analogy with a viscous body breaks\r\ndown. When subjected to strain the glacier does not yield by stretching,\r\nbut by breaking; this is the origin of the crevasses.\r\n\r\n15. The crevasses are produced by the mechanical strains to which the\r\nglacier is subjected. They are divided into marginal, transverse, and\r\nlongitudinal crevasses; the first produced by the oblique strain\r\nconsequent on the quicker motion of the centre; the second by the\r\npassage of the glacier over the summit of an incline; the third by\r\npressure from behind and resistance in front, which causes the mass to\r\nsplit at right angles to the pressure [strain?].\r\n\r\n16. The moulins are formed by deep cracks intersecting glacier rivulets.\r\nThe water in descending such cracks scoops out for itself a shaft,\r\nsometimes many feet wide, and some hundreds of feet deep, into which the\r\ncataract plunges with a sound like thunder. The supply of water is\r\nperiodically cut off from the moulins by fresh cracks, in which new\r\nmoulins are formed.\r\n\r\n17. The lateral moraines are formed from the debris which loads the\r\nglacier along its edges; the medial moraines are formed on a\r\ntrunk-glacier by the union of the lateral moraines of its tributaries;\r\nthe terminal moraines are formed from the debris carried by the glacier\r\nto its terminus, and there deposited. The number of medial moraines on a\r\ntrunk glacier is always one less than the number of tributaries.\r\n\r\n18. When ordinary lake-ice is intersected by a strong sunbeam it\r\nliquefies so as to form flower-shaped figures within the mass; each\r\nflower consists of six petals with a vacuous space at the centre; the\r\nflowers are always formed parallel to the planes of freezing, and depend\r\non the crystallization of the substance.\r\n\r\n19. Innumerable liquid disks, with vacuous spots, are also formed by the\r\nsolar beams in glacier-ice. These empty spaces have been hitherto\r\nmistaken for air-bubbles, the flat form of the disks being erroneously\r\nregarded as the result of pressure.\r\n\r\n20. These disks are indicators of the intimate constitution of\r\nglacier-ice, and they teach us that it is composed of an aggregate of\r\nparts with surfaces of crystallization in all possible planes.\r\n\r\n21. There are also innumerable small cells in glacier-ice holding air\r\nand water; such cells also occur in lake-ice; and here they are due to\r\nthe melting of the ice in contact with the bubble of air. Experiments\r\nare needed on glacier-ice in reference to this point.\r\n\r\n22. At a free surface within or without, ice melts with more ease than\r\nin the centre of a compact mass. The motion which we call heat is less\r\ncontrolled at a free surface, and it liberates the molecules from the\r\nsolid condition sooner than when the atoms are surrounded on all sides\r\nby other atoms which impede the molecular motion. Regelation is the\r\ncomplementary effect to the above; for here the superficial portions of\r\na mass of ice are made virtually central by the contact of a second\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n23. The dirt-bands have their origin in the ice-cascades. The glacier,\r\nin passing the brow, is transversely fractured; ridges are formed with\r\nhollows between them; these transverse hollows are the principal\r\nreceptacles of the fine debris scattered over the glacier; and after the\r\nridges have been melted away, the dirt remains in successive stripes\r\nupon the glacier.\r\n\r\n24. The ice of many glaciers is laminated, and when weathered may be\r\ncloven into thin plates. In the sound ice the lamination manifests\r\nitself in blue stripes drawn through the general whitish mass of the\r\nglacier; these blue veins representing portions of ice from which the\r\nair-bubbles have been more completely expelled. This is the veined\r\nstructure of the ice. It is divided into marginal, transverse, and\r\nlongitudinal structure; which may be regarded as complementary to\r\nmarginal, longitudinal, and transverse crevasses. The latter are\r\nproduced by tension, the former by pressure, which acts in two different\r\nways: firstly, the pressure acts upon the ice as it has acted upon rocks\r\nwhich exhibit the lamination technically called cleavage; secondly, it\r\nproduces partial liquefaction of the ice. The liquid spaces thus formed\r\nhelp the escape of the air from the glacier; and the water produced,\r\nbeing refrozen when the pressure is relieved, helps to form the blue\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE CLEAVAGE OF CRYSTALS AND SLATE-ROCKS.\r\n\r\nA LECTURE DELIVERED AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION, ON FRIDAY EVENING THE 6TH\r\nOF JUNE, 1856.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the student of physical science has to investigate the character of\r\nany natural force, his first care must be to purify it from the mixture\r\nof other forces, and thus study its simple action. If, for example, he\r\nwishes to know how a mass of water would shape itself, supposing it to\r\nbe at liberty to follow the bent of its own molecular forces, he must\r\nsee that these forces have free and undisturbed exercise. We might\r\nperhaps refer him to the dew-drop for a solution of the question; but\r\nhere we have to do, not only with the action of the molecules of the\r\nliquid upon each other, but also with the action of gravity upon the\r\nmass, which pulls the drop downwards and elongates it. If he would\r\nexamine the problem in its purity, he must do as Plateau has done,\r\nwithdraw the liquid mass from the action of gravity, and he would then\r\nfind the shape of the mass to be perfectly spherical. Natural processes\r\ncome to us in a mixed manner, and to the uninstructed mind are a mass of\r\nunintelligible confusion. Suppose half-a-dozen of the best musical\r\nperformers to be placed in the same room, each playing his own\r\ninstrument to perfection: though each individual instrument might be a\r\nwell-spring of melody, still the mixture of all would produce mere\r\nnoise. Thus it is with the processes of nature. In nature, mechanical\r\nand molecular laws mingle, and create apparent confusion. Their mixture\r\nconstitutes what may be called the _noise_ of natural laws, and it is\r\nthe vocation of the man of science to resolve this noise into its\r\ncomponents, and thus to detect the \"music\" in which the foundations of\r\nnature are laid.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of this detachment of one force from all other forces is\r\nnowhere more strikingly exhibited than in the phenomena of\r\ncrystallization. I have here a solution of sulphate of soda. Prolonging\r\nthe mental vision beyond the boundaries of sense, we see the atoms of\r\nthat liquid, like squadrons under the eye of an experienced general,\r\narranging themselves into battalions, gathering round a central\r\nstandard, and forming themselves into solid masses, which after a time\r\nassume the visible shape of the crystal which I here hold in my hand. I\r\nmay, like an ignorant meddler wishing to hasten matters, introduce\r\nconfusion into this order. I do so by plunging this glass rod into the\r\nvessel. The consequent action is not the pure expression of the\r\ncrystalline forces; the atoms rush together with the confusion of an\r\nunorganized mob, and not with the steady accuracy of a disciplined host.\r\nHere, also, in this mass of bismuth we have an example of this confused\r\ncrystallization; but in the crucible behind me a slower process is going\r\non: here there is an architect at work \"who makes no chips, no din,\" and\r\nwho is now building the particles into crystals, similar in shape and\r\nstructure to those beautiful masses which we see upon the table. By\r\npermitting alum to crystallize in this slow way, we obtain these perfect\r\noctahedrons; by allowing carbonate of lime to crystallize, nature\r\nproduces these beautiful rhomboids; when silica crystallizes, we have\r\nformed these hexagonal prisms capped at the ends by pyramids; by\r\nallowing saltpetre to crystallize, we have these prismatic masses; and\r\nwhen carbon crystallizes, we have the diamond. If we wish to obtain a\r\nperfect crystal, we must allow the molecular forces free play: if the\r\ncrystallizing mass be permitted to rest upon a surface it will be\r\nflattened, and to prevent this a small crystal must be so suspended as\r\nto be surrounded on all sides by the liquid, or, if it rest upon the\r\nsurface, it must be turned daily so as to present all its faces in\r\nsuccession to the working builder. In this way the scientific man nurses\r\nthese children of his intellect, watches over them with a care worthy of\r\nimitation, keeps all influences away which might possibly invade the\r\nstrict morality of crystalline laws, and finally sees them developed\r\ninto forms of symmetry and beauty which richly reward the care bestowed\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nIn building up crystals, these little atomic bricks often arrange\r\nthemselves into layers which are perfectly parallel to each other, and\r\nwhich can be separated by mechanical means; this is called the cleavage\r\nof the crystal. I have here a crystallized mass which has thus far\r\nescaped the abrading and disintegrating forces which, sooner or later,\r\ndetermine the fate of sugar-candy. If I am skilful enough, I shall\r\ndiscover that this crystal of sugar cleaves with peculiar facility in\r\none direction. Here, again, I have a mass of rock-salt: I lay my knife\r\nupon it, and with a blow cleave it in this direction; but I find on\r\nfurther examining this substance that it cleaves in more directions than\r\none. Laying my knife at right angles to its former position, the crystal\r\ncleaves again; and, finally placing the knife at right angles to the\r\ntwo former positions, the mass cleaves again. Thus rock-salt cleaves in\r\nthree directions, and the resulting solid is this perfect cube, which\r\nmay be broken up into any number of smaller cubes. Here is a mass of\r\nIceland spar, which also cleaves in three directions, not at right\r\nangles, but obliquely to each other, the resulting solid being a\r\nrhomboid. In each of these cases the mass cleaves with equal facility in\r\nall three directions. For the sake of completeness, I may say that many\r\nsubstances cleave with unequal facility in different directions, and the\r\nheavy spar I hold in my hand presents an example of this kind of\r\ncleavage.\r\n\r\nTurn we now to the consideration of some other phenomena to which the\r\nterm cleavage may be applied. This piece of beech-wood cleaves with\r\nfacility parallel to the fibre, and if our experiments were fine enough\r\nwe should discover that the cleavage is most perfect when the edge of\r\nthe axe is laid across the rings which mark the growth of the tree. The\r\nfibres of the wood lie side by side, and a comparatively small force is\r\nsufficient to separate them. If you look at this mass of hay severed\r\nfrom a rick, you will see a sort of cleavage developed in it also; the\r\nstalks lie in parallel planes, and only a small force is required to\r\nseparate them laterally. But we cannot regard the cleavage of the tree\r\nas the same in character as the cleavage of the hayrick. In the one case\r\nit is the atoms arranging themselves according to organic laws which\r\nproduce a cleavable structure; in the other case the easy separation in\r\na certain direction is due to the mechanical arrangement of the coarse\r\nsensible masses of stalks of hay.\r\n\r\nIn like manner I find that this piece of sandstone cleaves parallel to\r\nthe planes of bedding. This rock was once a powder, more or less coarse,\r\nheld in mechanical suspension by water. The powder was composed of two\r\ndistinct parts, fine grains of sand and small plates of mica. Imagine a\r\nwide strand covered by a tide which holds such powder in suspension:[B]\r\nhow will it sink? The rounded grains of sand will reach the bottom\r\nfirst, the mica afterwards, and when the tide recedes we have the little\r\nplates shining like spangles upon the surface of the sand. Each\r\nsuccessive tide brings its charge of mixed powder, deposits its duplex\r\nlayer day after day, and finally masses of immense thickness are thus\r\npiled up, which, by preserving the alternations of sand and mica, tell\r\nthe tale of their formation. I do not wish you to accept this without\r\nproof. Take the sand and mica, mix them together in water, and allow\r\nthem to subside, they will arrange themselves in the manner I have\r\nindicated; and by repeating the process you can actually build up a\r\nsandstone mass which shall be the exact counterpart of that presented by\r\nnature, as I have done in this glass jar. Now this structure cleaves\r\nwith readiness along the planes in which the particles of mica are\r\nstrewn. Here is a mass of such a rock sent to me from Halifax: here are\r\nother masses from the quarries of Over Darwen in Lancashire. With a\r\nhammer and chisel you see I can cleave them into flags; indeed these\r\nflags are made use of for roofing purposes in the districts from which\r\nthe specimens have come, and receive the name of \"slate-stone.\" But you\r\nwill discern, without a word from me, that this cleavage is not a\r\ncrystalline cleavage any more than that of a hayrick is. It is not an\r\narrangement produced by molecular forces; indeed it would be just as\r\nreasonable to suppose that in this jar of sand and mica the particles\r\narranged themselves into layers by the forces of crystallization,\r\ninstead of by the simple force of gravity, as to imagine that such a\r\ncleavage as this could be the product of crystallization.\r\n\r\nThis, so far as I am aware of, has never been imagined, and it has been\r\nagreed among geologists not to call such splitting as this cleavage at\r\nall, but to restrict the term to a class of phenomena which I shall now\r\nproceed to consider.\r\n\r\nThose who have visited the slate quarries of Cumberland and North Wales\r\nwill have witnessed the phenomena to which I refer. We have long drawn\r\nour supply of roofing-slates from such quarries; schoolboys ciphered on\r\nthese slates, they were used for tombstones in churchyards, and for\r\nbilliard-tables in the metropolis; but not until a comparatively late\r\nperiod did men begin to inquire how their wonderful structure was\r\nproduced. What is the agency which enables us to split Honister Crag, or\r\nthe cliffs of Snowdon, into laminae from crown to base? This question is\r\nat the present moment one of the greatest difficulties of geologists,\r\nand occupies their attention perhaps more than any other. You may wonder\r\nat this. Looking into the quarry of Penrhyn, you may be disposed to\r\nexplain the question as I heard it explained two years ago. \"These\r\nplanes of cleavage,\" said a friend who stood beside me on the quarry's\r\nedge, \"are the planes of stratification which have been lifted by some\r\nconvulsion into an almost vertical position.\" But this was a great\r\nmistake, and indeed here lies the grand difficulty of the problem. These\r\nplanes of cleavage stand in most cases at a high angle to the bedding.\r\nThanks to Sir Roderick Murchison, who has kindly permitted me the use of\r\nspecimens from the Museum of Practical Geology (and here I may be\r\npermitted to express my acknowledgments to the distinguished staff of\r\nthat noble establishment, who, instead of considering me an intruder,\r\nhave welcomed me as a brother), I am able to place the proof of this\r\nbefore you. Here is a mass of slate in which the planes of bedding are\r\ndistinctly marked; here are the planes of cleavage, and you see that one\r\nof them makes a large angle with the other. The cleavage of slates is\r\ntherefore not a question of stratification, and the problem which we\r\nhave now to consider is, \"By what cause has this cleavage been\r\nproduced?\"\r\n\r\nIn an able and elaborate essay on this subject in 1835, Professor\r\nSedgwick proposed the theory that cleavage is produced by the action of\r\ncrystalline or polar forces after the mass has been consolidated. \"We\r\nmay affirm,\" he says, \"that no retreat of the parts, no contraction of\r\ndimensions in passing to a solid state can explain such phenomena. They\r\nappear to me only resolvable on the supposition that crystalline or\r\npolar forces acted upon the whole mass simultaneously in one direction\r\nand with adequate force.\" And again, in another place: \"Crystalline\r\nforces have rearranged whole mountain-masses, producing a beautiful\r\ncrystalline cleavage, passing alike through all the strata.\"[C] The\r\nutterance of such a man struck deep, as was natural, into the minds of\r\ngeologists, and at the present day there are few who do not entertain\r\nthis view either in whole or in part.[D] The magnificence of the theory,\r\nindeed, has in some cases caused speculation to run riot, and we have\r\nbooks published, aye and largely sold, on the action of polar forces and\r\ngeologic magnetism, which rather astonish those who know something about\r\nthe subject. According to the theory referred to, miles and miles of the\r\ndistricts of North Wales and Cumberland, comprising huge\r\nmountain-masses, are neither more nor less than the parts of a gigantic\r\ncrystal. These masses of slate were originally fine mud; this mud is\r\ncomposed of the broken and abraded particles of older rocks. It contains\r\nsilica, alumina, iron, potash, soda, and mica, mixed in sensible masses\r\nmechanically together. In the course of ages the mass became\r\nconsolidated, and the theory before us assumes that afterwards a process\r\nof crystallization rearranged the particles and developed in the mass a\r\nsingle plane of crystalline cleavage. With reference to this hypothesis,\r\nI will only say that it is a bold stretch of analogies; but still it has\r\ndone good service: it has drawn attention to the question; right or\r\nwrong, a theory thus thoughtfully uttered has its value; it is a dynamic\r\npower which operates against intellectual stagnation; and, even by\r\nprovoking opposition, is eventually of service to the cause of truth. It\r\nwould, however, have been remarkable, if, among the ranks of geologists\r\nthemselves, men were not found to seek an explanation of the phenomena\r\nin question, which involved a less hardy spring on the part of the\r\nspeculative faculty than the view to which I have just referred.\r\n\r\nThe first step in an inquiry of this kind is to put oneself into contact\r\nwith nature, to seek facts. This has been done, and the labours of\r\nSharpe (the late President of the Geological Society, who, to the loss\r\nof science and the sorrow of all who knew him, has so suddenly been\r\ntaken away from us), Sorby, and others, have furnished us with a body of\r\nevidence which reveals to us certain important physical phenomena,\r\nassociated with the appearance of slaty cleavage, if they have not\r\nproduced it. The nature of this evidence we will now proceed to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nFossil shells are found in these slate-rocks. I have here several\r\nspecimens of such shells, occupying various positions with regard to the\r\ncleavage planes. They are squeezed, distorted, and crushed. In some\r\ncases a flattening of the convex shell occurs, in others the valves are\r\npressed by a force which acted in the plane of their junction, but in\r\nall cases the distortion is such as leads to the inference that the rock\r\nwhich contains these shells has been subjected to enormous pressure in a\r\ndirection at right angles to the planes of cleavage; the shells are all\r\nflattened and spread out upon these planes. I hold in my hand a fossil\r\ntrilobite of normal proportions. Here is a series of fossils of the same\r\ncreature which have suffered distortion. Some have lain across, some\r\nalong, and some oblique to the cleavage of the slate in which they are\r\nfound; in all cases the nature of the distortion is such as required for\r\nits production a compressing force acting at right angles to the planes\r\nof cleavage. As the creatures lay in the mud in the manner indicated,\r\nthe jaws of a gigantic vice appear to have closed upon them and squeezed\r\nthem into the shape you see. As further evidence of the exertion of\r\npressure, let me introduce to your notice a case of contortion which\r\nhas been adduced by Mr. Sorby. The bedding of the rock shown in this\r\nfigure[E] was once horizontal; at A we have a deep layer of mud, and at\r\n_m n_ a layer of comparatively unyielding gritty material; below that\r\nagain, at B, we have another layer of the fine mud of which slates are\r\nformed. This mass cleaves along the shading lines of the diagram; but\r\nlook at the shape of the intermediate bed: it is contorted into a\r\nserpentine form, and leads irresistibly to the conclusion that the mass\r\nhas been pressed together at right angles to the planes of cleavage.\r\nThis action can be experimentally imitated, and I have here a piece of\r\nclay in which this is done and the same result produced on a small\r\nscale. The amount of compression, indeed, might be roughly estimated by\r\nsupposing this contorted bed _m n_ to be stretched out, its length\r\nmeasured and compared with the distance _c d_; we find in this way that\r\nthe yielding of the mass has been considerable.\r\n\r\nLet me now direct your attention to another proof of pressure. You see\r\nthe varying colours which indicate the bedding on this mass of slate.\r\nThe dark portion, as I have stated, is gritty, and composed of\r\ncomparatively coarse particles, which, owing to their size, shape, and\r\ngravity, sink first and constitute the bottom of each layer. Gradually\r\nfrom bottom to top the coarseness diminishes, and near the upper surface\r\nof each layer we have a mass of comparatively fine clean mud. Sometimes\r\nthis fine mud forms distinct layers in a mass of slate-rock, and it is\r\nthe mud thus consolidated from which are derived the German\r\nrazor-stones, so much prized for the sharpening of surgical instruments.\r\nI have here an example of such a stone. When a bed is thin, the clean\r\nwhite mud is permitted to rest, as in this case, upon a slab of the\r\ncoarser slate in contact with it: when the bed is thick, it is cut into\r\nslices which are cemented to pieces of ordinary slate, and thus rendered\r\nstronger. The mud thus deposited sometimes in layers is, as might be\r\nexpected, often rolled up into nodular masses, carried forward, and\r\ndeposited by the rivers from which the slate-mud has subsided. Here,\r\nindeed, are such nodules enclosed in sandstone. Everybody who has\r\nciphered upon a school-slate must remember the whitish-green spots which\r\nsometimes dotted the surface of the slate; he will remember how his\r\nslate-pencil usually slid over such spots as if they were greasy. Now\r\nthese spots are composed of the finer mud, and they could not, on\r\naccount of their fineness, _bite_ the pencil like the surrounding gritty\r\nportions of the slate. Here is a beautiful example of the spots: you\r\nobserve them on the cleavage surface in broad patches; but if this mass\r\nhas been compressed at right angles to the planes of cleavage, ought we\r\nto expect the same marks when we look at the edge of the slab? The\r\nnodules will be flattened by such pressure, and we ought to see evidence\r\nof this flattening when we turn the slate edgeways. Here it is. The\r\nsection of a nodule is a sharp ellipse with its major axis parallel to\r\nthe cleavage. There are other examples of the same nature on the table;\r\nI have made excursions to the quarries of Wales and Cumberland, and to\r\nmany of the slate-yards of London, but the same fact invariably appears,\r\nand thus we elevate a common experience of our boyhood into evidence of\r\nthe highest significance as regards one of the most important problems\r\nof geology. In examining the magnetism of these slates, I was led to\r\ninfer that these spots would contain a less amount of iron than the\r\nsurrounding dark slate. The analysis was made for me by Mr. Hambly in\r\nthe laboratory of Dr. Percy at the School of Mines. The result which is\r\nstated in this Table justifies the conclusion to which I have referred.\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Slate._\r\n\r\n        Purple Slate. Two Analyses.\r\n  1. Percentage of iron           5.85\r\n  2.      \"      \"                6.13\r\n                   Mean           5.99\r\n\r\n        Greenish Slate.\r\n  1.

This is about the proportion\r\nwhich the magnetic experiments suggested.\r\n\r\nLet me now remind you that the facts which I have brought before you are\r\ntypical facts--each is the representative of a class. We have seen\r\nshells crushed, the unhappy trilobites squeezed, beds contorted, nodules\r\nof greenish marl flattened; and all these sources of independent\r\ntestimony point to one and the same conclusion, namely, that slate-rocks\r\nhave been subjected to enormous pressure in a direction at right angles\r\nto the planes of cleavage.[F]\r\n\r\nIn reference to Mr. Sorby's contorted bed, I have said that by\r\nsupposing it to be stretched out and its length measured, it would give\r\nus an idea of the amount of yielding of the mass above and below the\r\nbed. Such a measurement, however, would not quite give the amount of\r\nyielding; and here I would beg your attention to a point, the\r\nsignificance of which has, so far as I am aware of, hitherto escaped\r\nattention. I hold in my hand a specimen of slate, with its bedding\r\nmarked upon it; the lower portions of each bed are composed of a\r\ncomparatively coarse gritty material, something like what you may\r\nsuppose this contorted bed to be composed of. Well, I find that the\r\ncleavage takes a bend in crossing these gritty portions, and that the\r\ntendency of these portions is to cleave more at right angles to the\r\nbedding. Look to this diagram: when the forces commenced to act, this\r\nintermediate bed, which though comparatively unyielding is not entirely\r\nso, suffered longitudinal pressure; as it bent, the pressure became\r\ngradually more lateral, and the direction of its cleavage is exactly\r\nsuch as you would infer from a force of this kind--it is neither quite\r\nacross the bed, nor yet in the same direction as the cleavage of the\r\nslate above and below it, but intermediate between the two. Supposing\r\nthe cleavage to be at right angles to the pressure, this is the\r\ndirection which it ought to take across these more unyielding strata.\r\n\r\nThus we have established the concurrence of the phenomena of cleavage\r\nand pressure--that they accompany each other; but the question still\r\nremains, Is this pressure of itself sufficient to account for the\r\ncleavage? A single geologist, as far as I am aware, answers boldly in\r\nthe affirmative. This geologist is Sorby, who has attacked the question\r\nin the true spirit of a physical investigator. You remember the cleavage\r\nof the flags of Halifax and Over Darwen, which is caused by the\r\ninterposition of plates of mica between the layers. Mr. Sorby examines\r\nthe structure of slate-rock, and finds plates of mica to be a\r\nconstituent. He asks himself, what will be the effect of pressure upon a\r\nmass containing such plates confusedly mixed up in it? It will be, he\r\nargues--and he argues rightly--to place the plates with their flat\r\nsurfaces more or less perpendicular to the direction in which the\r\npressure is exerted. He takes scales of the oxide of iron, mixes them\r\nwith a fine powder, and, on squeezing the mass, finds that the tendency\r\nof the scales is to set themselves at right angles to the line of\r\npressure. Now the planes in which these plates arrange themselves will,\r\nhe contends, be those along which the mass cleaves.\r\n\r\nI could show you, by tests of a totally different character from those\r\napplied by Mr. Sorby, how true his conclusion is, that the effect of\r\npressure on elongated particles or plates will be such as he describes\r\nit. Nevertheless, while knowing this fact, and admiring the ability with\r\nwhich Mr. Sorby has treated this question, I cannot accept his\r\nexplanation of slate-cleavage. I believe that even if these plates of\r\nmica were wholly absent, the cleavage of slate-rocks would be much the\r\nsame as it is at present.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell here upon minor facts,--I will not urge that the\r\nperfection of the cleavage bears no relation to the quantity of mica\r\npresent; but I will come at once to a case which to my mind completely\r\nupsets the notion that such plates are a necessary element in the\r\nproduction of cleavage.\r\n\r\nHere is a mass of pure white wax: there are no mica particles here;\r\nthere are no scales of iron, or anything analogous mixed up with the\r\nmass. Here is the self-same substance submitted to pressure. I would\r\ninvite the attention of the eminent geologists whom I see before me to\r\nthe structure of this mass. No slate ever exhibited so clean a cleavage;\r\nit splits into laminae of surpassing tenuity, and proves at a single\r\nstroke that pressure is sufficient to produce cleavage, and that this\r\ncleavage is independent of the intermixed plates of mica assumed in Mr.\r\nSorby's theory. I have purposely mixed this wax with elongated\r\nparticles, and am unable to say at the present moment that the cleavage\r\nis sensibly affected by their presence,--if anything, I should say they\r\nrather impair its fineness and clearness than promote it.\r\n\r\nThe finer the slate the more perfect will be the resemblance of its\r\ncleavage to that of the wax. Compare the surface of the wax with the\r\nsurface of this slate from Borrodale in Cumberland. You have precisely\r\nthe same features in both: you see flakes clinging to the surfaces of\r\neach, which have been partially torn away by the cleavage of the mass: I\r\nentertain the conviction that if any close observer compares these two\r\neffects, he will be led to the conclusion that they are the product of a\r\ncommon cause.[G]\r\n\r\nBut you will ask, how, according to my view, does pressure produce this\r\nremarkable result? This may be stated in a very few words.\r\n\r\nNature is everywhere imperfect! The eye is not perfectly achromatic, the\r\ncolours of the rose and tulip are not pure colours, and the freshest air\r\nof our hills has a bit of poison in it. In like manner there is no such\r\nthing in nature as a body of perfectly homogeneous structure. I break\r\nthis clay which seems so intimately mixed, and find that the fracture\r\npresents to my eyes innumerable surfaces along which it has given way,\r\nand it has yielded along these surfaces because in them the cohesion of\r\nthe mass is less than elsewhere. I break this marble, and even this wax,\r\nand observe the same result: look at the mud at the bottom of a dried\r\npond; look to some of the ungravelled walks in Kensington Gardens on\r\ndrying after rain,--they are cracked and split, and other circumstances\r\nbeing equal, they crack and split where the cohesion of the mass is\r\nleast. Take then a mass of partially consolidated mud. Assuredly such a\r\nmass is divided and subdivided by surfaces along which the cohesion is\r\ncomparatively small. Penetrate the mass, and you will see it composed of\r\nnumberless irregular nodules bounded by surfaces of weak cohesion.\r\nFigure to your mind's eye such a mass subjected to pressure,--the mass\r\nyields and spreads out in the direction of least resistance;[H] the\r\nlittle nodules become converted into laminae, separated from each other\r\nby surfaces of weak cohesion, and the infallible result will be that\r\nsuch a mass will cleave at right angles to the line in which the\r\npressure is exerted.\r\n\r\nFurther, a mass of dried mud is full of cavities and fissures. If you\r\nbreak dried pipe-clay you see them in great numbers, and there are\r\nmultitudes of them so small that you cannot see them. I have here a\r\npiece of glass in which a bubble was enclosed; by the compression of the\r\nglass the bubble is flattened, and the sides of the bubble approach each\r\nother so closely as to exhibit the colours of thin plates. A similar\r\nflattening of the cavities must take place in squeezed mud, and this\r\nmust materially facilitate the cleavage of the mass in the direction\r\nalready indicated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the time at my disposal has not permitted me to develop this\r\nthought as far as I could wish, yet for the last twelve months the\r\nsubject has presented itself to me almost daily under one aspect or\r\nanother. I have never eaten a biscuit during this period in which an\r\nintellectual joy has not been superadded to the more sensual pleasure,\r\nfor I have remarked in all such cases cleavage developed in the mass by\r\nthe rolling-pin of the pastrycook or confectioner. I have only to break\r\nthese cakes, and to look at the fracture, to see the laminated structure\r\nof the mass; nay, I have the means of pushing the analogy further: I\r\nhave here some slate which was subjected to a high temperature during\r\nthe conflagration of Mr. Scott Russell's premises. I invite you to\r\ncompare this structure with that of a biscuit; air or vapour within the\r\nmass has caused it to swell, and the mechanical structure it reveals is\r\nprecisely that of a biscuit. I have gone a little into the mysteries of\r\nbaking while conducting my inquiries on this subject, and have received\r\nmuch instruction from a lady-friend in the manufacture of puff-paste.\r\nHere is some paste baked in this house under my own superintendence. The\r\ncleavage of our hills is accidental cleavage, but this is cleavage with\r\nintention. The volition of the pastrycook has entered into the formation\r\nof the mass, and it has been his aim to preserve a series of surfaces of\r\nstructural weakness, along which the dough divides into layers.\r\nPuff-paste must not be handled too much, for then the continuity of the\r\nsurfaces is broken; it ought to be rolled on a cold slab, to prevent the\r\nbutter from melting and diffusing itself through the mass, thus\r\nrendering it more homogeneous and less liable to split. This is the\r\nwhole philosophy of puff-paste; it is a grossly exaggerated case of\r\nslaty cleavage.\r\n\r\nAs time passed on, cases multiplied, illustrating the influence of\r\npressure in producing lamination. Mr. Warren De la Rue informs me that\r\nhe once wished to obtain white-lead in a fine granular state, and to\r\naccomplish this he first compressed the mass: the mould was conical, and\r\npermitted the mass to spread a little laterally under the pressure. The\r\nlamination was as perfect as that of slate, and quite defeated him in\r\nhis effort to obtain a granular powder. Mr. Brodie, as you are aware,\r\nhas recently discovered a new kind of graphite: here is the substance in\r\npowder, of exquisite fineness. This powder has the peculiarity of\r\nclinging together in little confederacies; it cannot be shaken asunder\r\nlike lycopodium; and when the mass is squeezed, these groups of\r\nparticles flatten, and a perfect cleavage is produced. Mr. Brodie\r\nhimself has been kind enough to furnish me with specimens for this\r\nevening's lecture. I will cleave them before you: you see they split up\r\ninto plates which are perpendicular to the line in which the pressure\r\nwas exerted. This testimony is all the more valuable, as the facts were\r\nobtained without any reference whatever to the question of cleavage.\r\n\r\nI have here a mass of that singular substance Boghead Cannel. This was\r\nonce a mass of mud, more or less resembling this one, which I have\r\nobtained from a bog in Lancashire. I feel some hesitation in bringing\r\nthis substance before you, for, as in other cases, so in regard to\r\nBoghead Cannel, science--not science, let me not libel it, but the\r\nquibbling, litigious, money-loving portion of human nature speaking\r\nthrough the mask of science--has so contrived to split hairs as to\r\nrender the qualities of the substance somewhat mythical. I shall\r\ntherefore content myself with showing you how it cleaves, and with\r\nexpressing my conviction that pressure had a great share in the\r\nproduction of this cleavage.\r\n\r\nThe principle which I have enunciated is so simple as to be almost\r\ntrivial; nevertheless, it embraces not only the cases I have mentioned,\r\nbut, if time permitted, I think I could show you that it takes a much\r\nwider range. When iron is taken from the puddling furnace, it is a more\r\nor less spongy mass: it is at a welding heat, and at this temperature is\r\nsubmitted to the process of rolling: bright smooth bars such as this are\r\nthe result of this rolling. But I have said that the mass is more or\r\nless spongy or nodular, and, notwithstanding the high heat, these\r\nnodules do not perfectly incorporate with their neighbours: what then?\r\nYou would say that the process of rolling must draw the nodules into\r\nfibres--it does so; and here is a mass acted upon by dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, which exhibits in a striking manner this fibrous structure. The\r\nexperiment was made by my friend Dr. Percy, without any reference to the\r\nquestion of cleavage.\r\n\r\nHere are other cases of fibrous iron. This fibrous structure is the\r\nresult of mechanical treatment. Break a mass of ordinary iron and you\r\nhave a granular fracture; beat the mass, you elongate these granules,\r\nand finally render the mass fibrous. Here are pieces of rails along\r\nwhich the wheels of locomotives have slidden; the granules have yielded\r\nand become plates; they exfoliate or come off in leaves. All these\r\neffects belong, I believe, to the great class of phenomena of which\r\nslaty cleavage forms the most prominent example.[I]\r\n\r\nThus, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the termination of our\r\ntask. I commenced by exhibiting to you some of the phenomena of\r\ncrystallization. I have placed before you the facts which are found to\r\nbe associated with the cleavage of slate-rocks. These facts, as finely\r\nexpressed by Helmholtz, are so many telescopes to our spiritual vision,\r\nby which we can see backward through the night of antiquity, and discern\r\nthe forces which have been in operation upon the earth's surface\r\n\r\n  \"Ere the lion roared,\r\n  Or the eagle soared.\"\r\n\r\nFrom evidence of the most independent and trustworthy character, we come\r\nto the conclusion that these slaty masses have been subjected to\r\nenormous pressure, and by the sure method of experiment we have\r\nshown--and this is the only really new point which has been brought\r\nbefore you--how the pressure is sufficient to produce the cleavage.\r\nExpanding our field of view, we find the self-same law, whose footsteps\r\nwe trace amid the crags of Wales and Cumberland, stretching its\r\nubiquitous fingers into the domain of the pastrycook and ironfounder;\r\nnay, a wheel cannot roll over the half-dried mud of our streets without\r\nrevealing to us more or less of the features of this law. I would say,\r\nin conclusion, that the spirit in which this problem has been attacked\r\nby geologists indicates the dawning of a new day for their science. The\r\ngreat intellects who have laboured at geology, and who have raised it to\r\nits present pitch of grandeur, were compelled to deal with the subject\r\nin mass; they had no time to look after details. But the desire for more\r\nexact knowledge is increasing; facts are flowing in, which, while they\r\nleave untouched the intrinsic wonders of geology, are gradually\r\nsupplanting by solid truths the uncertain speculations which beset the\r\nsubject in its infancy. Geologists now aim to imitate, as far as\r\npossible, the conditions of nature, and to produce her results; they are\r\napproaching more and more to the domain of physics; and I trust the day\r\nwill soon come when we shall interlace our friendly arms across the\r\ncommon boundary of our sciences, and pursue our respective tasks in a\r\nspirit of mutual helpfulness, encouragement, and good-will.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Referred to in the Introduction.\r\n\r\n[B] I merely use this as an illustration; the deposition may have really\r\nbeen due to sediment carried down by rivers. But the action must have\r\nbeen periodic, and the powder duplex.\r\n\r\n[C] 'Transactions of the Geological Society,' Ser. ii. vol. iii. p. 477.\r\n\r\n[D] In a letter to Sir Charles Lyell, dated from the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nFebruary 20, 1836, Sir John Herschel writes as follows:--\"If rocks have\r\nbeen so heated as to allow of a commencement of crystallization, that is\r\nto say, if they have been heated to a point at which the particles can\r\nbegin to move amongst themselves, or at least on their own axes, some\r\ngeneral law must then determine the position in which these particles\r\nwill rest on cooling. Probably that position will have some relation to\r\nthe direction in which the heat escapes. Now when all or a majority of\r\nparticles of the same nature have a general tendency to one position,\r\nthat must of course determine a cleavage plane.\"\r\n\r\n[E] Omitted here.\r\n\r\n[F] While to my mind the evidence in proof of pressure seems perfectly\r\nirresistible, I by no means assert that the manner in which I stated it\r\nis incapable of modification. All that I deem important is the fact that\r\npressure has been exerted; and provided this remain firm, the fate of\r\nany minor portion of the evidence by which it is here established is of\r\ncomparatively little moment.\r\n\r\n[G] I have usually softened the wax by warming it, kneaded it with the\r\nfingers, and pressed it between thick plates of glass previously wetted.\r\nAt the ordinary summer-temperature the wax is soft, and tears rather\r\nthan cleaves; on this account I cool my compressed specimens in a\r\nmixture of pounded ice and salt, and when thus cooled they split\r\nbeautifully.\r\n\r\n[H] It is scarcely necessary to say that if the mass were squeezed\r\nequally in _all_ directions no laminated structure could be produced; it\r\nmust have room to yield in a lateral direction.\r\n\r\n[I] An eminent authority informs me that he believes these surfaces of\r\nweak cohesion to be due to the interposition of films of graphite, and\r\nnot to any tendency of the iron itself to become fibrous: this of course\r\ndoes not in any way militate against the theory which I have ventured to\r\npropose. All that the theory requires is surfaces of weak cohesion,\r\nhowever produced, and a change of shape of such surfaces consequent on\r\npressure or rolling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n
