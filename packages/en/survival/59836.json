DYSON\r\n               Head, Department of Geology and Geography\r\n                          Lafayette College[1]\r\n\r\nUntil recently a geologist was visualized by most people as a queer sort\r\nof fellow who went around the countryside breaking rocks with a little\r\nhammer. Fortunately, the general public today has a much clearer picture\r\nof the geologist and his science, but there are still many among us who\r\nmistakenly feel that geology is something too remote for practical\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nGeology is the science of the Earth. It includes a history of our planet\r\nstarting with its origin, and a history of the life which has lived upon\r\nit. From it we can determine the reason for every feature of the\r\nlandscape and every rock structure underneath the surface, and we can\r\nfurther learn what processes gave rise to them.\r\n\r\nPractically everything to be seen on the face of the Earth owes its\r\norigin directly or indirectly to geological processes. These may be\r\ngrouped into two great categories: Internal forces or agents which\r\nraise, lower, bend, and break the Earth's crust; and external, more\r\nfamiliar agents such as water, wind, and ice, which wear away the\r\nsurface and carry the materials to another place--ultimately to the sea.\r\nLet us consider a few of the products of these geologic agents: (1) The\r\nsoil covering most of the landscape and furnishing the plant products\r\nwhich serve as our food; (2) the solid rock, so conspicuous in all\r\nmountain ranges; (3) the hills, the valleys, and the mountains; (4) all\r\nthe streams, ponds, lakes--even the sea. If you live in a place where\r\nman has covered up the rock and the soil evidence of geological\r\nprocesses is yielded by the buildings themselves, whether they be of\r\nstone quarried from the Earth's crust, or of brick made from clay. The\r\nstone and brick are supported by a framework of steel originally taken\r\nfrom a mine in the form of iron ore. The concrete and asphalt of the\r\nroads came from rocks within the Earth, as did every drop of gasoline\r\nwhich plays so vital a part in world affairs today. Even those\r\ncommonplaces of American life, the bottle and the \"tin\" can, are\r\nproducts of geology. As you read this you need look only at your watch\r\nor perhaps an item of jewelry which you wear to see something--gold,\r\nsilver, platinum, a diamond or other gem stone--which is a part of\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nThus, from here it is a short step to the realization that a number of\r\ngeologic processes and agents working over long periods of time have\r\ngiven rise to innumerable features and structures ranging from the\r\nloftiest mountains down to the smallest hills and valleys; from the soil\r\nwhich grows our food to the gasoline and coal which feed our industries;\r\nfrom our huge iron ore deposits down to the much smaller, but now no\r\nless significant, deposits of uranium.\r\n\r\nHow is all this related to a national park? Nowhere within our land can\r\nthe accomplishments of the great geological processes, or their\r\npresent-day operation, be seen to better advantage than in many of our\r\nnational parks and monuments. In fact, it is for this reason principally\r\nthat many of them were established. Notable is Grand Canyon National\r\nPark, containing the most spectacular part of the Colorado's mile-deep\r\ncanyon cut during the past million or so years through a series of rocks\r\nwhich themselves record a billion or more years of Earth history. Mount\r\nRainier is the largest volcano in the United States. On it glaciers are\r\nnow wearing away materials formerly extruded and piled up to spectacular\r\nheight by volcanic forces. Crater Lake lies in the sunken throat of a\r\nvolcano which at one time probably rivaled Rainier in size. In Carlsbad\r\nCaverns and Mammoth Cave National Parks are two of the world's largest\r\ncaverns which clearly demonstrate the tremendous effectiveness of\r\nsubsurface water in dissolving limestone. Bryce Canyon and Zion National\r\nParks and the Badlands National Monument illustrated on a much smaller\r\nbut no less spectacular scale than the Grand Canyon the wonderful\r\nerosive power of running water. In Grand Teton one can see a huge block\r\nof the crust which has been raised thousands of feet along a high-angle\r\nfault, and at Lassen Peak in California and Craters of the Moon in Idaho\r\nthere are exhibited some of the most recent volcanic features north of\r\nthe Rio Grande. Despite Yellowstone's wildlife and fishing it is best\r\nknown perhaps for its geysers. This brief list is by no means complete,\r\nfor something of prime geologic interest can be found in almost every\r\nnational park and monument.\r\n\r\nNow we come to Glacier National Park. Within its boundaries there\r\nperhaps is exhibited a greater variety of geologic features than in any\r\nof the others. Much of the park lies above timberline so that the rocks\r\nwhich comprise its mountains are exposed to view. Held within these\r\nsuperb mountains is an entertaining geologic story which they are\r\nanxious and willing to tell us. All we need to do is unlock the door\r\nwith the key the geologist gives us and then go see for ourselves. Why\r\ndo the mountains rise so precipitously above the plains? What is that\r\nconspicuous black band across the faces of so many of the peaks, and how\r\ndid it get there? Why are some of the rocks so red? The answers to these\r\nand other questions come out as the geologic story unfolds. The American\r\npeople are interested in this story for they realize that to understand\r\nwhat they see is to increase their enjoyment thousandfold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Chart of Geologic Time\r\n  (FOR A CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF EVENTS, THE CHART SHOULD BE READ FROM\r\n                             BOTTOM TO TOP)\r\n\r\n     ERAS PERIODS        DATES            EVENTS IN GLACIER PARK AREA\r\n\r\n  CENOZOIC\r\n                      The Present\r\n       Post Glacial                Erosion of the mountains; formation of\r\n                                   alluvial fans and talus cones.\r\n                      15,000 B.C.\r\n       Pleistocene                 Birth of modern glaciers.\r\n                                   Appearance of present forests.\r\n                   1,000,000 B.C.\r\n       Pliocene                    Extensive glaciation.

No matter\r\nwhere one looks this feature greets his view. If he enters the park at\r\nthe St. Mary Entrance, there ahead on the sides of Singleshot and East\r\nFlattop Mountains are white and purple bands. Should he enter first the\r\nSwiftcurrent Valley, he would soon note the banding in the mountains\r\nlying to his right and left, and finally culminating in the precipitous\r\nGarden Wall at the head of the valley. The visitor soon realizes that\r\nevery mountain within the park is composed of rock layers of various\r\ncolors. With very few exceptions these strata are of sedimentary origin;\r\nthat is, they accumulated by depositions of muds and sands in a body of\r\nwater and are now mainly limestones, shales, and sandstones. These\r\nsedimentary rocks all belong to a single large unit known as the Belt\r\nseries, so named because of exposures in the Little Belt and Big Belt\r\nMountains farther south in Montana. In Glacier National Park these\r\nrocks, which have a maximum thickness of more than 20,000 feet, are in\r\nthe form of a large syncline (downfold), the east and west edges of\r\nwhich form the crests of the Lewis and Livingstone Ranges (Figure 3D).\r\nThroughout the large area of western Montana, northern Idaho, and\r\nsouthern British Columbia where Belt rocks occur, they are important\r\nmountain-makers. In addition to the ranges already mentioned they are\r\nthe principal rocks in many others, including the Mission, Swan, and\r\nFlathead in the region south of Glacier Park; the Bitterroot and Coeur\r\nd'Alene between Idaho and Montana; and the Purcell in British Columbia.\r\nFurther, rocks of similar age form the core of the Uinta Range in Utah\r\nand the lower section of the Grand Canyon in Arizona.\r\n\r\nDuring the Proterozoic Era of Earth history a long, narrow section of\r\nNorth America extending from the Arctic Ocean southward, probably as far\r\nas Arizona and southern California, slowly sank to form a large,\r\nshallow, sea-filled trough known as a geosyncline (Figure 1). Streams\r\nfrom adjacent lands carried muds and sands into the sea, at times almost\r\ncompletely filling it. Inasmuch as thousands of feet of sediments were\r\ndeposited, the geosyncline must have continued to sink throughout the\r\nperiod of sedimentation. Eventually the muds were compacted into shales,\r\nor limestones if they contained a lot of lime, and the sands into\r\nsandstones. These are the rocks we now know as the Belt series. The\r\nsurfaces of many of the sandstone layers are covered with ripple marks\r\nwhich could have been made only by wave and current action in shallow\r\nwater. Mudcracks on many of the shale beds prove that at times the\r\nsediments, probably near the mouths of rivers were exposed to the air\r\nlong enough to dry out. Great thicknesses of limestone and numerous\r\nfossils of calcareous algae, primitive marine plants, are evidences that\r\nthe body of water was a sea.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1. BELT GEOSYNCLINE\r\n\r\nThroughout the geologic past the appearance and disappearance of seas on\r\nthe continents have been frequent events. In fact such changes are\r\nslowly taking place even today. Hudson Bay and the Baltic and North Seas\r\nare examples of shallow seas situated on the continents. The area around\r\nHudson Bay is rising; as attested by the fact that some of the fish\r\nweirs constructed in water along the shore during the past several\r\nhundred years are now a considerable distance inland. We know also that\r\nour Atlantic coast has been subsiding for a number of years at an annual\r\nrate of about 0.02 feet. To be sure, these movements are slow, but if\r\ncontinued over a long period they might conceivably make some rather\r\nprofound changes, even as the birth and death of the Belt sea.\r\n\r\nWithin Glacier National Park the Belt series is divided on the basis of\r\nlithologic differences into six distinct formations. Because each has a\r\ncharacteristic color, these formations can easily be identified, often\r\nfrom distances of several miles. Usually two, sometimes three or four,\r\nof them comprise a single mountain, the oldest always at the mountain\r\nbase and the youngest on the summit, this being the relative position in\r\nwhich they were deposited in the form of sediment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUD CRACKS ON A LAYER OF THE APPEKUNNY FORMATION\r\n           (PHOTO BY C. L. FENTON. OUR AMAZING EARTH. DOUBLEDAY AND CO.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIPPLE MARKS ON A LAYER OF THE SHEPARD FORMATION NEAR\r\nLOGAN PASS. THEIR ASSYMMETRICAL FORM INDICATES FORMATION BY CURRENTS IN\r\nSHALLOW WATER.\r\n                                                           (DYSON PHOTO)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Belt Formations\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ALTYN FORMATION.\r\n\r\nThis is the oldest of the several formations and thus occupies a\r\nstratigraphic position at the base of the entire series. It is composed\r\nmainly of sandy dolomites (magnesian limestones) and limestones which\r\nweather to a light buff color. It outcrops all along the base of the\r\neastern front of the Lewis Range and comprises the entire block of Chief\r\nMountain. Because of its comparatively great resistance to weathering\r\nand erosion it usually forms a conspicuous ridge or terrace wherever it\r\ncrosses a valley. In the Swiftcurrent Valley it forms the dam which\r\nholds in Swiftcurrent Lake and creates Swiftcurrent Falls. In Two\r\nMedicine Valley the highway crosses a similar terrace which gives rise\r\nalso to Trick Falls. In the St. Mary Valley it creates the Narrows and\r\nforms the imposing wall in lee of which East Glacier Campground is\r\nlocated. The rock of this formation can best be examined on the ridge\r\nimmediately east of Many Glacier Hotel (between hotel and parking lot)\r\nand above Swiftcurrent Falls. Its average thickness is about 2,300 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          APPEKUNNY FORMATION.\r\n\r\nLying on top of the Altyn are 3,000 or more feet of prevailing greenish\r\nshales and argillites[2] comprising the Appekunny formation. Slabs of\r\nthese rocks, because of their great hardness, have been used as\r\nflagstones in the walks at the Many Glacier Ranger Station and adjacent\r\nPark Service residential area. Mud cracks and ripple marks are common.\r\nThe formation is prominent on the side of Singleshot Mountain near the\r\nSt. Mary entrance to the park, and everywhere immediately overlying the\r\nlighter-hued Altyn along the east edge of the Lewis Range where,\r\nespecially when seen from a distance, it appears to have a purplish\r\ncolor. It also outcrops along the western base of the Livingstone Range\r\n(Figure 3D), but such exposures are as a rule obscured by a cover of\r\ndense forest. Accessible outcrops can readily be examined along\r\nGoing-to-the-Sun Highway for several miles east of Sun Point and near\r\nMcDonald Falls, and also along the lower part of the Grinnell Glacier\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GRINNELL FORMATION.\r\n\r\nBecause of their dominantly red color, the shaly argillites which\r\ncomprise the bulk of this formation are the most conspicuous rocks in\r\nthe park. They lie immediately on top of the Appekunny and although\r\ntheir thickness varies considerably it is greater than 3,000 feet in\r\nseveral localities. Interbedded with the red argillites are thin white\r\nlayers of quartzite, a former sandstone which has been converted by\r\npressure into an extraordinarily hard, dense rock. Mud cracks, ripple\r\nand current marks, raindrop impressions, and other features made while\r\nthe sediments were accumulating are common. The red color is due to\r\nabundant iron oxide occurring mainly as a cement between the sand and\r\nmud grains. All the rocks of Glacier Park contain some iron, or rather\r\ncontain iron-bearing minerals. These minerals have various colors unless\r\nthey have been oxidized, in which case the color is red or brown.\r\nOxidation of the Grinnell formation probably took place while the mud\r\nwas accumulating and during those periods when it was exposed to the\r\natmosphere. At such times also the mud dried and cracked, the marks of\r\nwhich are so prominent on the surfaces of the layers today.\r\n\r\nThe Grinnell formation seems to be everywhere. In the Many Glacier\r\nregion it comprises the bulk of Grinnell Point, Altyn Peak, and Mount\r\nAllen, and is no less striking in the bases of Mount Wilbur and the\r\nGarden Wall. Ptarmigan Tunnel is drilled through it, and the trails to\r\nGrinnell Glacier, Cracker and Iceberg Lakes cross it. Redrock Falls, on\r\nthe trail to Swiftcurrent Pass, and Ptarmigan Falls on the Iceberg Lake\r\ntrail drop over several of its highly colored layers.\r\n\r\nFrom the Blackfeet Highway on top of Two Medicine Ridge one can see the\r\ndark red rocks of this formation capping the summits of Rising Wolf and\r\nRed Mountains. Even from the valley floor it is just as noticeable.\r\nSinopah Mountain standing alone and impressive across the lake from Two\r\nMedicine Chalets carries the red banner of the Grinnell formation.\r\n\r\nThese red rocks constitute an important scenic feature for many miles\r\nalong Going-to-the-Sun Highway. If one begins his trip on this highway\r\nat its east entrance he soon finds himself in the midst of a group of\r\nimposing red peaks--Goat and Going-to-the-Sun on the right, Red Eagle\r\nand Mahtotopa on the left. The road crosses the formation along a mile\r\nand a half stretch just west of Baring Creek bridge. Innumerable loose\r\nslabs of red rock along the side of the road contain excellent mud\r\ncracks and ripple marks. Near Avalanche creek on the west side of Logan\r\nPass the highway crosses the Grinnell where it comes to the surface on\r\nthe western limb of the big syncline.\r\n\r\nThe formation is well exposed in the vicinity of Sperry Chalet and\r\nGlacier. It forms all the mountains surrounding the basin in which the\r\nchalet is located, and the trail from chalet to glacier lies wholly on\r\nit. At the glacier intensely folded white quartzite layers and red\r\nargillites are very conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe visitor can readily trace the Grinnell from place to place\r\nthroughout the entire park area, and can thus easily visualize that it\r\nas well as all other formations at one time filled the intervening\r\nspaces between the mountains. (See color of cover pages.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SIYEH FORMATION.\r\n\r\nNext above the Grinnell is a thick limestone formation which, because of\r\nits weathered buff color, stands out in sharp contrast to the red beds\r\nupon which it rests. It is the greatest cliff-maker in the park and in\r\nseveral places its entire thickness of 4,000 feet may be exposed in a\r\nsingle nearly vertical cliff. Since it is younger than the three\r\npreceding formations, it is confined mainly to the higher elevations,\r\ncapping many of the loftiest peaks within the Lewis and Livingstone\r\nRanges. In the Many Glacier area such peaks are Mount Gould and the\r\nGarden Wall, Mounts Siyeh, Grinnell, Allen, Wilbur, and Henkel. A number\r\nof others, including Little Chief, Jackson, Gunsight, Fusillade,\r\nGoing-to-the-Sun, Piegan, Pollock, Cannon, and Heavens Peak, are visible\r\nfrom Going-to-the-Sun Highway. The huge peaks--Kinnerly, Kintla, Carter,\r\nand Rainbow--which stand guard at the heads of Kintla and Bowman Lakes\r\nare composed of the Siyeh. The list also includes Cleveland, highest and\r\nlargest of all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALGAE COLONIES IN SIYEH LIMESTONE NEAR GRINNELL GLACIER.\r\n                                                           (DYSON PHOTO)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENTLY TILTED STRATA OF THE SIYEH FORMATION IN GRINNELL\r\nMOUNTAIN.\r\n                                                           (DYSON PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nWithin the Siyeh there is a bed, averaging about 60 feet thick, composed\r\nalmost entirely of fossil algae which apparently formed an extensive\r\nreef or biostrome on the floor of the shallow Belt Sea. The algae\r\ncolonies are in the form of rounded masses up to several feet in\r\ndiameter and bear a crude resemblance externally and internally to a\r\nhead of lettuce or cabbage. Geologists know these algae by the genus\r\nname Collenia. Because of the rounded and smoothed surfaces on these\r\ncolonies, mountain climbers frequently find the reef difficult to cross.\r\nIt appears as a distinct light gray horizontal band on the east face of\r\nMount Wilbur about midway between the base of the cliff and the peak's\r\nsummit, where it can easily be seen from Many Glacier Hotel and\r\nSwiftcurrent Camp. It is also discernible on the Pinnacle Wall above\r\nIceberg Lake and in Mount Grinnell. The Swiftcurrent Pass trail crosses\r\nit just east of the pass, and it is also exposed along Going-to-the-Sun\r\nHighway below the big switchback on the west side of Logan Pass where\r\nattention is directed to it by a sign. Unweathered portions of the reef\r\nrock are light blue. A similar but thinner reef outcrops at Logan Pass\r\nnear the start of the Hidden Lake trail. Although most of the fossil\r\nalgae occur in the Siyeh they are present in the younger formations and\r\nalso in the Altyn. Other than algae the only undoubted fossils of the\r\nBelt series within Glacier National Park are burrows probably made by\r\nworms. They are rare and are restricted mainly to the Siyeh formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSSIL ALGAE IN SIYEH FORMATION, HOLE-IN-THE-WALL BASIN.\r\n     (THE ROCK BOOK BY C. L. FENTON AND M. A. FENTON, DOUBLEDAY AND CO.)]\r\n\r\nAt the top of the Siyeh are several hundred feet of sandy and shaly\r\nbeds, mostly reddish in color, grouped by some geologists into a\r\ndistinct formation known as the Spokane. At Logan Pass it is about 700\r\nfeet thick and is well exposed in the lower parts of Clements and\r\nReynolds Mountains, and at the site of the former \"Clements\" Glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SHEPARD FORMATION.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred feet of limy beds which weather yellow-brown lie on top\r\nof the Siyeh. Although named for outcrops on the cliff above Shepard\r\nGlacier (south of Stoney Indian Pass and near the site of the old\r\nFifty-Mountain tent camp) the formation is exposed on the summit of\r\nSwiftcurrent Mountain at the head of Swiftcurrent Valley, on Reynolds\r\nand Clements Mountains near Logan Pass, and on Citadel and Almost-a-Dog,\r\nvisible from Going-to-the-Sun Highway in St. Mary Valley. The formation\r\nis replete with mud cracks and ripple marks. Some rock surfaces exhibit\r\ntwo and three sets of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           KINTLA FORMATION.\r\n\r\nThese beds have the same bright red color as those of the Grinnell.\r\nHowever, because they are the youngest rocks of the Belt series they\r\noutcrop only on a few mountaintops, and inasmuch as these are mainly in\r\nthe northwest part of the park, comparatively few people have noticed\r\nthis formation. Visitors to Cameron Lake in Waterton Lakes National Park\r\ncan see it in the red north wall of Mount Custer. The mountains around\r\ncolorful Boulder Pass and Hole-in-the-Wall Basin are likewise composed\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nWithin the rocks of this formation there is a great abundance of small\r\ncubes believed to be casts of salt crystals which formed when the\r\nsediments were accumulating. Their presence indicates an arid climate\r\nand intensive evaporation of the sea, similar to the condition at Great\r\nSalt Lake today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Igneous Rocks of the Belt Series\r\n\r\n\r\nNot all of Glacier Park's rocks accumulated slowly and quietly as\r\nsediment in a body of water. At many places, interbedded with and\r\ncutting across the sediments, there are bodies of igneous rock which\r\nreached their present position in the form of hot molten material forced\r\nup from deep within the crust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMNAR SECTION OF BELT ROCKS]\r\n\r\n                                PROTEROZOIC\r\n\r\n  KINTLA             860'+       Red argillite\r\n  SHEPARD            600'        Buff limestone\r\n  PURCELL            250'        Black lava\r\n  SIYEH              4000'       Dark diorite bordered by white altered\r\n                                 limestone\r\n                                 Blue limestone.

Several\r\ntimes this lava poured out forming a total thickness varying between 50\r\nand 275 feet. One of the best exposures is on the west side of\r\nSwiftcurrent Pass and in Granite Park just west and northwest of the\r\nchalet. In fact it is this lava flow which gives the name, albeit\r\nwrongly, to Granite Park. The material of the flow is very fine-grained\r\nand dark (basic), in contrast to the light color and coarse grain of\r\ngranite. Nonetheless, many prospectors are wont to call every igneous\r\nrock, regardless of its composition, a granite. A number of ellipsoidal\r\nstructures (\"pillows\") up to two feet in diameter within this lava\r\nindicate that it was extruded under water. The Purcell is thickest in\r\nthe vicinity of Boulder Pass, where the trail traverses its ropy and\r\nstringy surface for a distance of several hundred yards.\r\n\r\nLater, after the Shepard and part of the Kintla formation were laid down\r\non top of the Purcell, another similar flow spread over the sea floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DIORITE SILL.\r\n\r\nFew persons visit the park without noticing the pronounced black layer,\r\nwithin the Siyeh formation, present on many of the high peaks. It is\r\nmost in evidence on the face of the Garden Wall viewed from the vicinity\r\nof Many Glacier Hotel, although it is plainly visible also in Mount\r\nWilbur and the wall above Iceberg Lake. Passengers on the Waterton Lake\r\nlaunch can see it cutting across the stupendous north face of Mount\r\nCleveland. From Going-to-the-Sun Highway it can be seen on Mahtotopa,\r\nLittle Chief, Citadel, Piegan, and Going-to-the-Sun Mountains, and on\r\nthe west side of the Garden Wall, where it also forms the cap of\r\nHaystack Butte. It is everywhere about 100 feet thick, and thus can be\r\nused as a very accurate scale for determining the height of mountains on\r\nwhich it is discernible.\r\n\r\nThis imposing layer of rock, unlike the lava, never reached the surface\r\nin a molten state, but was intruded between beds of sedimentary rock and\r\nthus became a sill instead of a flow. We need only a glance to determine\r\nits intrusive nature. Wherever it occurs it is bordered at top and\r\nbottom by thinner gray layers. These are Siyeh limestone which was\r\nchanged to marble by the tremendous heat of the diorite during its\r\nintrusion. This effect is termed contact metamorphism by geologists.\r\nBecause this contact-metamorphosed zone is at both top and bottom of the\r\nsill we know the latter was intruded into the adjacent rocks. Lava\r\nflows, even though covered later by sediments, of course alter only the\r\nunderlying rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GARDEN WALL AND GRINNELL GLACIER. THE WALL IS\r\nCOMPOSED OF SIYEH LIMESTONE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE GLACIER AND THE\r\nGRINNELL FORMATION BELOW IT.\r\n                                                           (DYSON PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nThe sill can readily be examined in a number of places where trails\r\ncross it, notably at Swiftcurrent and Piegan Passes, and north of\r\nGranite Park near Ahern Pass. But nowhere is it as accessible as on\r\nLogan Pass. It lies beneath the parking lot at a depth of only a few\r\nfeet, and is exposed on both sides of the pass. To inspect it, one need\r\nwalk only about 200 yards along the trail leading to Granite Park. In a\r\ndistance of less than 100 feet the trail traverses from fresh Siyeh\r\nlimestone across the entire altered (contact-metamorphosed) zone, here\r\n12 to 20 feet wide, into the center of the sill. All parts of the sill\r\nand adjacent rocks can readily be examined and studied in detail at this\r\nsite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOP OF THE DIORITE SILL OF BLACKFOOT GLACIER. THE MAN IS\r\nSTANDING ON THE SILL. LIGHT ROCK OVERLYING SILL IS CONTACT-METAMORPHOSED\r\nSIYEH LIMESTONE.\r\n                                                           (DYSON PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nA number of dikes[3] of Belt age, some of which undoubtedly were feeders\r\nto the sill and flows, cut vertically up through the sedimentary\r\nformations. Some of the dikes are less resistant to weathering and\r\nerosion than the rocks surrounding them; consequently their more rapid\r\nremoval results in the formation of narrow vertical chimneys or recesses\r\nwhich appear as snow-filled chutes on the mountainsides in spring and\r\nearly summer. Such a feature almost invariably indicates the presence of\r\na dike. From Many Glacier Hotel one of these can be seen on the red\r\nmountain in front of Mount Wilbur. Another, 1,500 feet high, transects\r\nthe Pinnacle Wall at the outlet of Iceberg Lake. The dike which forms\r\nthis impressive chute is less than thirty feet wide. Though not so\r\nconspicuous as the sills some of these dikes are of interest because\r\nthey contain various ore minerals, principally copper, which today form\r\nsmall deposits along their borders. About the beginning of the century\r\nthese were responsible for a short-lived mining boom, the best known\r\nvestige of which is the remains of the mill at Cracker Lake. The old\r\nCracker Mine, with entrance now caved in, was driven along a dike which\r\nhas a width of over 100 feet.\r\n\r\nFrom the boat landing at the head of Josephine Lake the dump of another\r\nmine appears as a tiny gray-green mound on a narrow shelf high on the\r\nprecipitous wall of Grinnell Point. Like the Cracker Mine this one was\r\ndug along the edge of a similar but smaller dike. All these deposits are\r\ninsignificant in size and of no commercial value. Had they been\r\nimportant this great area might never have been set aside as a national\r\npark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT WILBUR AND THE PINNACLE WALL VIEWED FROM MANY\r\nGLACIER HOTEL.

Following this event many feet of the younger Belt sediments\r\nwere removed by erosion. The sea probably returned and received more\r\nsediments during much of the Paleozoic Era, although no trace of these\r\nrocks has been found inside the park boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CRETACEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\nNot until the Cretaceous period of Earth history, about 100 million\r\nyears ago, did the geologic record again become clear. At that time a\r\ngreat thickness of mud and sand was deposited in the geosyncline burying\r\ndeeply the ancient Belt and other rocks which had accumulated as\r\nsediment during the preceding several hundred million years. Life had\r\nmade tremendous advances in this interval, and the abundance of fossils\r\nin Cretaceous rocks indicates that the sea swarmed with shelled\r\ncreatures during that period.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE LEWIS OVERTHRUST.\r\n\r\nToward the end of Cretaceous time tremendous crustal forces, principally\r\nfrom the west, were directed against the geosyncline with the result\r\nthat its rocks were compressed and uplifted, converting the site of the\r\nformer sea into a mountainous region. Similar activity took place\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the entire geosyncline, which\r\nresulted in the formation of the Rocky Mountain system stretching\r\nbetween Mexico and Alaska. A number of mountains were formed on other\r\ncontinents during this period. So widespread and tremendous was the\r\ndeformation, especially in the present day Rocky Mountain region, that\r\nit is known as the Rocky Mountain, or Laramide (after the Laramie Range\r\nin Wyoming), revolution. Mountain-building forces continued for several\r\nmillion years in the Glacier Park area, finally squeezing the rocks into\r\na great fold (anticline). Continued pressure from the west overturned\r\nthe fold and put additional strain on the rock layers, eventually\r\ncausing them to break along a great low-angle fault. The western limb of\r\nthe fold, now a great slice of the crust, was driven upward and eastward\r\nover the eastern limb ultimately reversing the order of rock layers by\r\nplacing older on top of younger ones (Figure 3). These younger layers\r\nare Cretaceous shales and sandstones underlying the plains immediately\r\neast of the mountains. The mountains themselves have been carved by\r\nstreams and glaciers from the Belt formations comprising the upper block\r\nof older rock, that slice of the crust which has been moved more than 15\r\nmiles toward the east. The surface over which it was pushed is the Lewis\r\noverthrust. At the time this great break occurred the part of it now\r\nexposed in Glacier National Park was deeply buried. It was long after\r\nthat when removal by erosion of overlying Belt rocks, possibly several\r\nthousand feet of them, finally exposed the fault.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 2.

HIGHWAYS\r\n\r\nMovement along this fault was slow--so slow that had people been present\r\nat the time they probably would not have been aware that anything of an\r\nunusual nature was occurring. Occasionally along many large faults,\r\nhowever, there is sudden movement of small magnitude, usually not more\r\nthan a few inches, but strong enough to vibrate the crust. These\r\nvibrations are earthquakes, and their frequent occurrence in California\r\nand elsewhere along the Pacific coast indicates the presence of numerous\r\nactive faults. Their occurrence also in the northern Rockies, as at\r\nHelena, Montana in 1935 and 1936, attests to the fact that some of the\r\nfaults here are still active.\r\n\r\nThe Lewis overthrust comes to the surface at the base of the Altyn\r\nformation along the entire precipitous east front of the Lewis Range and\r\ncan be traced nearly 100 miles northward into Canada and for almost an\r\nequal distance south of the park. The section lying within the park is\r\ntilted very gently toward the southwest, the angle of dip seldom\r\nexceeding ten degrees. In some places it is practically horizontal. For\r\nthis reason the lower courses of all the largest, and some of the small,\r\nvalleys on the east side of the Lewis Range have been cut entirely\r\nthrough the upper block (overthrust) of Belt rocks down into the weak\r\nCretaceous shales underneath. This causes the trace of the overthrust to\r\nbe very sinuous and also accounts for the deep indentations in the\r\nmountain front formed by Swiftcurrent, St. Mary, Two Medicine, and other\r\nvalleys. The floors in the lower courses of these valleys, because they\r\nlie below the level of the thrust surface, are composed of Cretaceous\r\nshales. In most places these rocks are covered by glacial moraine, but\r\nthey are exposed along the highway from Babb into the Swiftcurrent\r\nValley, especially along the shore of Sherburne Reservoir and near the\r\nentrance station. Because these shales readily disintegrate when exposed\r\nto the atmosphere they give rise to slumps and landslides which,\r\nalthough of small proportions, cause a great deal of damage to the\r\nhighway, sections of which must be rebuilt annually. At most damaged\r\nspots along the route the shales appear as a dark mud or clay in the\r\nroadcuts. The bumpy topography of the whole slope lying north of the\r\nroad has been formed by innumerable such small landslides.\r\n\r\nA deep well located near Cameron Falls in Waterton Townsite (Waterton\r\nLakes National Park) about one mile west of the edge of the mountains\r\npasses through 1,500 feet of Belt rocks and then penetrates the Lewis\r\noverthrust and the Cretaceous shales beneath.\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of Glacier National Park just north of Marias Pass,\r\nDebris Creek has cut a hole or \"window\" (known as a fenster by\r\ngeologists) through the overthrust block (Figure 2). Thus a small area\r\nof Cretaceous rock completely surrounded by the Belt series lies within\r\nthe mountains. This is the only such Cretaceous outcrop in the park, but\r\nlike the well at Waterton, it serves as a reminder that the rocks of\r\nthis period are everywhere present under the mountains, and their\r\nsurface constitutes the \"sliding board\" over which the upper, more\r\nmassive block of Belt rocks was pushed. And so we see that the mountains\r\nof Glacier National Park, unlike many of the world's great ranges, have\r\nno roots, for they rest on a base of greatly different and much less\r\nresistant material, the Cretaceous shales. Presumably the Lewis\r\noverthrust and Cretaceous rocks beneath it would be penetrated by a well\r\ndrilled anywhere within the mountains, although in the Livingstone Range\r\nthe depth of such a well would be very great (Figure 3D).\r\n\r\nFIGURE 3.

The best known of\r\nthese is Chief Mountain situated near the northeast corner of the park\r\nseveral miles west of the Chief Mountain International Highway. It is a\r\nmass of Altyn limestone rising vertically on its east, south and north\r\nsides for a distance of 1,500 feet. The Lewis overthrust is well exposed\r\nall around its base. Two smaller pinnacles immediately to the west are\r\nsimilar outliers, and, like Chief Mountain, were once part of the main\r\nmass of the Lewis Range (Figure 3D and cover sketch). Divide Peak, at\r\nthe west end of Hudson Bay Divide, is another outlier. It, too, is\r\ncomposed entirely of the Altyn formation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lewis overthrust is exposed in a great number of places\r\nvery few of these are easily accessible, and at only one does a trail\r\nprovide a close approach to the actual contact between Belt and\r\nCretaceous rocks. The latter site lies along Roes Creek only a few\r\nhundred yards from East Glacier Campground. Before reaching the fault at\r\nthe base of a high cliff of Altyn limestone, the trail crosses several\r\noutcrops of Cretaceous sandstone replete with fossil pelecypods (clams)\r\nand gastropods (snails). The fault surface is covered by loose rock\r\nwhere the trail crosses it, but on the opposite side of the stream a\r\nzone of crushed Altyn limestone and Cretaceous shale is visible.\r\n\r\nFrom U. S. Highway No. 2 just east of Marias Pass an excellent distant\r\nview of the thrust may be obtained. About three miles to the north it\r\nappears as a nearly horizontal line high on the side of Summit Mountain.\r\nAbove it is a vertical cliff in which white Altyn and red Grinnell are\r\nprominent, and below is a gentler slope composed of gray-brown\r\nCretaceous shale.\r\n\r\nCretaceous rocks with relatively low resistance to Earth stresses, were\r\nstrongly crumpled and folded during the period of overthrusting. The\r\nfolded zone extends several miles eastward from the mountains (Figure 3\r\nD), and may be seen to good advantage along Blackfeet Highway on the\r\nnorth side of Two Medicine Ridge, where a series of thin shales and\r\nsandstones has been squeezed into anticlines and synclines.\r\n\r\nIt is because of the Lewis overthrust that there are no significant\r\nfoothills on the east side of the Lewis Range. The fault has brought\r\ninto direct contact the massive and resistant Belt rocks which stand up\r\nas mountains, and the relatively weak shales of the plains which are\r\ncarved into subdued landscape features by erosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEWIS OVERTHRUST AT BASE OF MT. WYNN SEEN FROM HIGHWAY\r\nEAST OF MANY GLACIER HOTEL. OVERTHRUST LIES AT BASE OF CLIFF.

For a short period of time a lake,\r\nin which clay was deposited, covered the floor of this depressed area.\r\nThe present valley of the North Fork of the Flathead River lies on this\r\ndownfaulted block (Figure 3D), and the western boundary of the\r\nLivingstone Range marks the trace of the fault. Because the fault is of\r\nthe high-angle variety the front of this range is much straighter than\r\nthat of the Lewis Range which is formed by the notched eastern edge of\r\nthe relatively thin overthrust block. The Belton Hills and Apgar\r\nMountains near the park's west entrance are isolated blocks separated\r\nfrom the Livingstone Range by normal faults probably dating from the\r\ntime the North Fork Valley subsided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Effect of the Ice Age\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Miocene and Pliocene time the mountains were deeply eroded by\r\nstreams. It was during this time that Chief Mountain, Divide Peak, and\r\ntwo smaller outliers, and the fenster along Debris Creek were formed.\r\nAll of the existing mountain valleys were cut out of the overthrust\r\nblock, although not to as great a depth as they have today. The time\r\nrequired for their formation amounted to several millions of years. The\r\nresult of all this erosion was a landscape very similar to the present\r\nday Blue Ridge in Virginia and North Carolina, the type which geologists\r\ncall mature.\r\n\r\nNear the close of Pliocene time the climate cooled, timberline began to\r\nlower, and increasing amounts of permanent snow accumulated in the\r\nhigher parts of the mountains. Finally glaciers formed from the snow and\r\nbegan to move down the stream-carved valleys. This marked the advent of\r\nPleistocene time (The Glacial Age) nearly a million years ago. Glaciers\r\neventually filled all valleys and covered all the park area except the\r\nsummits of the highest peaks. Glaciers extended from valleys on the east\r\nside of the Lewis Range far out onto the plains, and from the\r\nLivingstone Range and the west side of the Lewis Range they moved into\r\nthe wide Flathead Valley. The forests disappeared and it is probable\r\nthat not a single tree remained in the area which is now the park.\r\nAvailable evidence indicates that climatic fluctuations during\r\nPleistocene time caused the glaciers to disappear for a considerable\r\nperiod of time, or at least to shrink to insignificant size and then to\r\nreturn. At the end of Pleistocene time they began to shrink and about\r\n9,000 years ago, during what is generally regarded as post-Pleistocene\r\ntime, disappeared again.\r\n\r\nThe large Pleistocene glaciers greatly altered the pre-existing\r\nlandscape of the park by gouging out valleys to much greater depth, and\r\nmaking their sides and heads much steeper than the streams had been able\r\nto cut them. Most of the lakes, vertical cliffs, sharp peaks, and\r\nwaterfalls which constitute much of the park's magnificent scenery were\r\ncreated as a result of intensive glacier action.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Last Chapter\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough events of the last 9,000 or so years didn't create the large\r\nspectacular features of the landscape, this period is nonetheless\r\ninteresting because it witnessed the birth of all existing park glaciers\r\nand the return of the trees composing the present-day forests. As soon\r\nas the glaciers began to shrink trees undoubtedly started to reclothe\r\nthe newly exposed surfaces. New varieties came from areas which had not\r\nbeen glaciated. From the Pacific coast came grand fir, Douglas fir,\r\nlarch, hemlock, white pine and others. From the east came another group\r\nincluding aspen, paper birch, hawthorn and maple. The native trees\r\ndriven out by the ice also returned to again become important elements\r\nof the flora. These are Engelmann spruce, alpine fir, and lodgepole\r\npine. A few species, among which are the alpine willows, driven\r\nsouthward from the far north during the Pleistocene period still persist\r\nat high altitudes but they are always ready to move down into the\r\nvalleys if the climate should again become cool. Of course, continued\r\nwarming would cause them to disappear. After the large Pleistocene\r\nstreams of ice disappeared there followed a period of about 5,000 years\r\nduring which the climate was somewhat warmer and drier than at present,\r\nconditions under which even very small glaciers could not have survived.\r\nThen about 4,000 years ago the advent of the cooler climate brought\r\nabout the origin of the present glaciers. During the period of their\r\nexistence they have fluctuated in size, probably attaining maximum\r\ndimensions around the middle of the last century. Since then they have\r\nbeen steadily shrinking, a sure indication that the climate is becoming\r\nmilder, as it has so many times in the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT JACKSON, VISIBLE FROM GOING-TO-THE-SUN HIGHWAY, IS\r\nCOMPOSED OF STEEPLY TILTED STRATA OF THE SIYEH FORMATION.

These moraines\r\nthus represent the amount of material removed, and then deposited,\r\nwithin the last 4,000 years. They are particularly striking at Grinnell\r\nand Sperry Glaciers and at the site of the former Clements Glacier near\r\nLogan Pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORAINE NEAR GRINNELL GLACIER IS 120 FEET HIGH.\r\n                                                           (DYSON PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nFollowing disappearance of the large Pleistocene glaciers streams\r\nreturned to the valleys and began to cut new valleys within the old.\r\nBecause post-Pleistocene time has been of such short duration these new\r\nvalleys are small youthful gorges. Interesting examples are Sunrift\r\nGorge, where Baring Creek has cut a narrow channel into the upper part\r\nof the Appekunny formation; and the gorge at Hidden Falls on Hidden\r\nCreek in the Grinnell Valley. Sunrift Gorge lies only a few feet north\r\nof Going-to-the-Sun Highway at Baring Creek bridge, and Hidden Gorge is\r\na stop on the guided trip which Ranger-Naturalists conduct from Many\r\nGlacier Hotel to Grinnell Lake. Both of these channels have very smooth,\r\nstraight sides because they have been eroded along vertical fractures\r\nknown as joints. The latter are common throughout the mountains and are\r\nresponsible for the smooth surfaces on some of the highest cliffs. The\r\ngorge of Avalanche Creek near Avalanche Campground is another example of\r\npost-glacial stream erosion, only here the whirling action of sand and\r\ngravel-laden water has carved out a number of cylindrical potholes in\r\nthe stream course. Some of them, though only 6 to 10 feet across, are 20\r\nor more feet deep.\r\n\r\nSince we know that the streams did not begin to cut these gorges until\r\nthe large Pleistocene glaciers had disappeared from those sites,\r\napproximately 10,000 years have been required for their formation. Thus\r\nthe average maximum rate of down-cutting has been of the magnitude of\r\n0.002 to 0.003 inch per year. With these figures as a foundation it is\r\nnot so difficult to comprehend that the much larger valleys of the park\r\ncould not have been eroded in less than several millions of years.\r\n\r\nAnother common, though seldom noticed, post-glacial feature of the park\r\nis the alluvial fan. These are fan-shaped accumulations of gravel\r\ndeposited by swift, tributary streams where they enter a main valley.\r\nSome of them have grown so large as to dam the stream in the major\r\nvalley and cause a lake (Figure 2). St. Mary, Lower St. Mary, Lower Two\r\nMedicine, and Waterton Lakes are held in by such dams. The alluvial fan\r\nof Divide Creek which holds in St. Mary Lake can easily be distinguished\r\nfrom Going-to-the-Sun Highway on the north side of the lake near its\r\noutlet. The St. Mary Entrance Station is located on this fan. The lower\r\nlake is dammed by a large fan built into the St. Mary Valley by\r\nSwiftcurrent Creek. The straight section of highway between the town of\r\nBabb and the St. Mary River bridge lies on the lower part of this fan.\r\nInasmuch as the Pleistocene glaciers undoubtedly removed any such fans\r\nmade previously, those which are present today must have been\r\nconstructed since disappearance of the ice, and are then not more than\r\n12,000 years old. Most of them are somewhat older, possibly by as much\r\nas two or three thousand years, than the gorges mentioned above, because\r\nthe latter are located nearer the source of the glaciers, and their\r\nsites were thus still covered by ice after the fans had already begun to\r\nform. After the Pleistocene glaciers began their final retreat several\r\nthousand years elapsed before they disappeared from the mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONT OF LEWIS RANGE, NORTH SIDE OF SWIFTCURRENT VALLEY.\r\nTHE LEWIS OVERTHRUST LIES AT THE BASE OF THE CLIFF. THREE LARGE TALUS\r\nCONES ARE VISIBLE BELOW MT. ALTYN ON THE LEFT.\r\n                                                           (DYSON PHOTO)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous of all post-glacial features is the talus\r\ncone, an accumulation of angular rock fragments which fall from cliffs.\r\nIt is only at the base of a crevice or chimney that this material takes\r\nthe apparent form of a distinct cone. Elsewhere it is referred to as a\r\ntalus slope or simply as talus, or, in the parlance of some\r\nmountaineers, as scree. Although several thousand years have been\r\nrequired for their formation most talus accumulations in the park are\r\nstill actively growing, especially in spring and early summer when rocks\r\nare pried loose by the alternate freezing and thawing of moisture within\r\nfractures. The artillery-like crack made when a falling rock crashes to\r\nthe base of a high cliff is a familiar sound to anyone who has spent\r\nmuch time in the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               The Future\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know that the processes of erosion and weathering will continue, that\r\nalluvial fans and talus cones will grow larger, and gorges will be\r\neroded deeper, and as a result the mountains will be cut down to lower\r\nelevations. But, as we have seen, this event will require much time. If\r\nthe present climate continues for a few more years our remaining\r\nglaciers will disappear, but there is nothing in geologic history which\r\nsays they won't return again, possibly even to the size of their heyday\r\nin the Pleistocene. And if history repeats itself, and all past geologic\r\nhistory has been a repetition, then the mountains will eventually be\r\nworn down to an uneventful plain and the sea will invade the land again.\r\n\r\nBut certain breeds of man are the only despoilers of mountains that we\r\nneed fear, so if the good citizens of our land keep the human invader\r\nand his dams and earth-moving equipment out of our national parks these\r\ngrand mountains will endure for many thousands, yes, even millions of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Footnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Dr. Dyson worked as a ranger-naturalist in Glacier National Park for\r\n    eight summers starting in 1935.\r\n\r\n[2]Argillite is the term used by geologists for a rock, originally a\r\n    shale, which has been recrystallized or made harder by greater\r\n    pressure.
