Were it\r\nnot for Cranks nearly all mechanical appliances would be motionless.\r\n\r\nMen’s thoughts and opinions would all be the same, without some such\r\ndevice to get them out of the old notions, grooves and ruts in which\r\nthey long have indulged and plodded. The world has known Cranks ever\r\nsince our first parents adopted the wearing of fig leaves, and Noah\r\ntook up ship building on the weather bureau suggesting cloudy weather\r\nand showers in Eastern Turkey. Moses was a Crank when he forbid the\r\neating of pork, salt water eels, turkey buzzards, owls and all other\r\nunclean birds, fish or animals of any kind, but there is no doubt that\r\nthese commands were none of his mistakes.\r\n\r\nSacred writ gives a plenty of such characters, but, by skipping\r\nto times more recent, we find such Cranks as Copernicus, Galileo,\r\nColumbus, Newton, Franklin, and, during the last century, the Crank\r\nfamily has greatly increased with Daguerre, Watt, Howe, Edison, Marconi\r\nand Tesla and scores of others, who, in some of the earlier times,\r\nwould have been hung or burned as wizards and sorcerers.\r\n\r\nPolitical, historical and religious Cranks have sprung up, turning over\r\nand upsetting many old-fogey and absurd notions and beliefs of the past.\r\n\r\nIn former times Cranks were the subject of ridicule and persecution\r\nfor trying to inject some new ideas into the public mind. History is\r\nprofuse with abuses of some of the best thoughts and discoveries that\r\nhave come to the human race.\r\n\r\nSupposing Copernicus had never advanced and enforced a conclusion that\r\nthe Earth was round and revolved on its axis, such motion causing the\r\napparent rising and setting of the Sun. Only for this we might to\r\nthis day believe in the story of Joshua’s command over the sun and\r\nmoon, and associate believers with Parson Jasper that “De sun do\r\nmove.” It is pleasant to realize that we are living in a time when\r\nnew thoughts do not frighten people, and we are not scared at what we\r\ncannot understand, even if it does not harmonize with antiquated ideas\r\npurporting to be 4,000 to 6,000 years old.\r\n\r\nThe humble and obscure individual who presumes to offer the few\r\nsucceeding pages of crude ideas may be classed among pigmy Cranks,\r\nbut, nevertheless, feels impelled to sow a little thoughtful seed on a\r\nsubject that, to his knowledge, has never been discussed; and with a\r\nhope that such seed may some of it fall in good ground, and spring up\r\na crop of criticism that may ultimate in some better mind taking it up\r\nand demonstrate with the success that the writer believes it merits.\r\n\r\nTo prove that the Earth was round required a long time and a serious\r\namount of persecution. Now, to assume that it is hollow, may require\r\nmore time than the brief discussion in this small book. Yet it is hoped\r\nthe ideas here may take root in the enlightenment of the present day\r\nand start a growth productive of good fruit in the future. In order\r\nto discuss this question involves a task that in the outset may look\r\ndiscouraging, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe ax must be laid at the root of many favorite and long accepted\r\nbeliefs laid down by scientific authorities to explain the principal\r\nphenomena of disturbances on and in the Mother Earth, and to overthrow\r\nnearly all accepted theories on the following subjects:\r\n\r\nThe assumption that the Earth is intensely hot or in a molten state in\r\nits interior;\r\n\r\nThe presumption that it is a solid ball;\r\n\r\nThe supposition that there is an actual pole;\r\n\r\nThat hills and mountains are always results of volcanoes;\r\n\r\nThat volcanoes are a prime or natural existence;\r\n\r\nThat living springs and lakes are results of surface influence;\r\n\r\nThe theories of the Gulf Stream;\r\n\r\nIcebergs and the Ice belt, their formation;\r\n\r\nGlaciers, how formed;\r\n\r\nEquable condition of the Mediterranean Sea;\r\n\r\nAnd the Law of Attraction of Gravitation,\r\n\r\nOr that the Sun is a mass of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFIRE AND WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two elements of fire and water are evidently the source of all\r\ncreated things.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose in this plain and homely dissertation to review and\r\ncriticise some theories set forth by scientists, and to introduce some\r\nnew ones more acceptable to the mind of the writer, and to be submitted\r\nto observing minds to decide upon their merit.\r\n\r\nIt is a generally believed assertion that the Earth has been a molten\r\nmass at or near its origin, except from the rather doubtful story of\r\ncreation related in first chapter of Genesis, where it appears that\r\nthe spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. When or how they\r\nwere created, the story fails to relate. But, admitting the waters\r\nto prevail to such an extent as to incline God’s spirit for a voyage\r\nthereon, would make the idea of a molten Earth rather improbable.\r\n\r\nThe Earth is said to be undergoing a cooling process for the past\r\nthousands of years, but at some remote time in the past it was covered\r\nwith ice and traversed by glaciers.\r\n\r\nThere are various explanations of the phenomena of icebergs, glaciers,\r\nvolcanoes, the Gulf Stream, and why the Mediterranean Sea does not fill\r\nup or change its conditions through the thousands of years known to\r\nhistory. The philosophy of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, increase of\r\nheat in digging deep in the earth, artesian wells, springs and lakes,\r\nall have various solutions for being as they are, but this discussion\r\nproposes to throw into the waste-basket nearly all of the accepted\r\nconclusions on the subject, and, in order to go to an extreme limit\r\nof Crankism, will dispute the law of Attraction of Gravitation. To\r\ndispute the long accepted conclusions on most of these topics would be\r\npresumptuous without an effort to give good and sufficient reason for\r\nsuch skepticism.\r\n\r\nThe first element to consider will be fire, or heat, without which, it\r\nseems safe to assert, nothing can be produced from the Earth, or by\r\nthe devices of man. To draw a base line to work from, we will begin at\r\nthe polar center of the Earth’s motion. The Earth, unlike any other\r\nobject that perpetually revolves that we see or know of, does not have\r\na shaft, or axle, or anything to create friction, and, therefore,\r\nheat. There is but one word in the English language that tells what\r\nwill produce heat; that is friction, which may claim motion for its\r\nparentage. Now, this proposition is offered for a starting point. All\r\nheat is produced by friction, in the absence of which there can be no\r\nheat. This claim made, and presumably well established, how can there\r\nbe any central heat of the Earth, revolving on nothing but an imaginary\r\ncenter? Will any scientist explain at what point heat begins to\r\ngenerate? It would appear as difficult as to accurately fix the point\r\nwhere moral responsibility commences in a child, or just when the wheel\r\nof time will cease to revolve. At whatever point heat begins, is it\r\nsupposable that it works internally or outward? Any observing mind can\r\ngive but one answer.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed, to prove the molten condition of the Earth’s interior,\r\nthat the various borings for artesian wells and diggings in mines show\r\na uniform increase of heat as greater depths are attained. All these\r\nratios of increase differ somewhat in different localities, but not\r\nenough to have ever banished the idea that at a few thousand feet of\r\ndepth everything would be a liquid mass. This idea ought to be absurd\r\nenough to make a brazen image smile.\r\n\r\nLet us consider what these explorations into the bowels of the Earth\r\namount to. The deepest holes bored or dug are, without exception, less\r\nthan a mile deep. Admitting a mile, that is 1-4000 of the distance\r\ntoward the center. Imagine a puncture on an orange, or on a ball eight\r\ninches in diameter being four inches to the center. Is there any man\r\nliving could see a hole as small in proportion to its size to 1-4000 of\r\none-half of its diameter? How insignificant such a test. Reasons for\r\nthis delusion will be given later on, under treatment of Volcanoes.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Earth’s surface is covered with at least four-fifths water\r\nat depths ranging from one to five miles, including the millions of\r\nsprings, lakes and rivers on land, to say nothing of the inexhaustible\r\nquantities of water encountered in the aforesaid boring and mining\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe deepest explorations in mines are the salt mines of Poland, the\r\nCalumet and Hecla copper mines and Comstock Lode. These have all\r\nbeen on trail of some mineral deposit formed by some remote work of\r\nNature in the undefinable past, when volcanic or other influences in\r\nNature’s laboratory left their deposit. These are the only places that\r\nman has explored, only insignificant depths, and formed extravagant\r\nconclusions of the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nBut let us go back to the oceans, with their great depths and extended\r\nareas, and what do we find? It is this: Whether on the Equator or on\r\nthe coasts of Greenland, in the tropics or frigid latitudes the same,\r\nthat at the deepest sea soundings the temperature is near or below the\r\nfreezing point, being literally liquid ice. These temperatures are at\r\ndepths of five times as deep as anybody has bored or dug, and cover\r\nfour-fifths of the Earth’s surface, and, instead of being hot, or even\r\nwarm, are extremely cold.\r\n\r\nIf the internal heat is as great as is claimed, it ought to be enough\r\nto set every drop of water in the oceans into a boiling condition\r\ninside of fifteen minutes, but there does not seem to be heat enough to\r\nwarm the bottom of the kettle.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that the earth originated in a nebulous form, or an\r\naggregation of small starry bodies, or something else which nobody has\r\nas yet explained clearly.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that our Earth has come into its present form through a\r\nvast amount of time and changes, and is made up largely of liquids and\r\nplastic substances, which must have had an existence in its origin.\r\nThere is little doubt but that all its composition has been revolving\r\nthrough space in some form for countless millions of years with its\r\nmixtures of liquid, gaseous and solid constituents.\r\n\r\nIt does not need a long argument to demonstrate that bodies in such\r\nrevolutions as the earth is making have a tendency, by centrifugal\r\nforce, to throw the heavier elements to the outside, and as this seems\r\nto be a universal law in all scientific experiments by man, it seems\r\nreasonable to suppose the earth’s centrifugal forces are no exception\r\nin their results. Such being the case, leads at once to the supposition\r\nand probability that the Earth is a hollow globe, and not a solid mass,\r\nwith points of actual poles at each end that can be explored.\r\n\r\nAs water is, and has been in all history we know of, so large a part of\r\nthe earth’s mass, the object of this writing is to show the wonderful\r\ninfluence it exerts in the world’s affairs, and the ample provision\r\nNature has in store, and where it is stored, for man, and animals, and\r\nvegetation to bank on.\r\n\r\nBut, in passing, it is just that a name for many recent years that has\r\nbeen a subject for ridicule should be noticed with profound respect for\r\nhis wise and superior observations. This man for whom I wish to speak\r\na word of commendation and admiration is Captain John Cleves Symmes,\r\nwho I am prepared to allow the honor of first advancing the theory that\r\nthe Earth is hollow, and has been held up as the authority for finding\r\n“Symmes’s Hole.” While the present writer had never seen or read any of\r\nhis arguments for such a hole, the idea came originally, as if never\r\nthought of by my worthy predecessor. To avoid any charge of plagiarism,\r\nthis topic will, therefore, be treated as if never before thought of.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the Earth is hollow, the purpose will be in the\r\nfollowing pages to show how and why, and the great importance to the\r\ninhabitants of the outside that it should be so. The first proposition\r\nis, therefore, a hollow Earth from causes heretofore named by\r\ncentrifugal force; next, that the inside is an ocean of fresh water,\r\nwith continents of land, and the outside oceans of salt water and its\r\ncontinents, as we have partially learned of them.\r\n\r\nThat the ice belts in each frigid zone are the dividing lines between\r\nsalt and fresh water. That openings at the approach to either pole\r\nare at least 1,500 miles across, and that a magnetic compass above a\r\nlatitude of eighty to eighty-eight degrees will not keep its natural\r\nposition at any point within such latitude, but will, in its endeavor\r\nto point the needle to the true center of motion, lift up the point in\r\norder to keep the right bearing, or show some other embarrassment or\r\nirregularity. Whoever explores at these latitudes is, instead of going\r\nin a course directly to the center of motion, unconsciously rounding a\r\ncircle toward the inside.\r\n\r\nThe flattened condition of the Earth at the poles goes to accommodate\r\nboth the claims of being hollow and how it came to be so.\r\n\r\nWe are informed that every raindrop is hollow falling through a short\r\namount of space, and how more reasonable to suppose the Earth’s great\r\nmass to be so, revolving in an eternity of space.\r\n\r\nIt is more than presumable to suppose that every planetary body in the\r\nuniverse is hollow, and made so by the same fixed law for all flexible\r\nbodies in revolution to become hollow. Are not the rings of Saturn thus\r\nproduced?\r\n\r\nHere is a planet they tell us is seven hundred times as large as the\r\nEarth, but its density only ninety times as great. His mean diameter\r\nabout 70,000 miles and compression one-tenth, so that the polar\r\ndiameter is 3,500 miles less, and the equatorial 3,500 miles more than\r\nits mean, thus duplicating largely the shape and globular form of the\r\nEarth. Is it not reasonable, then, to suppose that the lack of density\r\nhas allowed its revolutions to produce its series of rings, those most\r\ndense being outside? And the whole order being such, that our position\r\nallows us to look through them instead of on to an outside surface?\r\n\r\nJupiter has the same characteristics in diameters. The mean, 85,000\r\nmiles; equatorial, 87,800; polar, 82,200, a difference of 5,600 miles,\r\nwhich means the same influences and same reason to make it hollow.\r\nWhile 1,233 times as large as the Earth, its density of substance is\r\nonly 301 times as much. Here we have the two largest planets, perhaps\r\nyet in their period of development for being inhabited, in very like\r\nform relatively as the Earth.\r\n\r\nIt may not be ill-timed to assert at this point the belief that all\r\nplanetary bodies are hollow and cool, not one in a molten condition or\r\ngiving out heat, but only generating heat in their own atmospheres,\r\nthus giving out light, which we, in our ignorance, attribute to a\r\nmass of intense heat or a globe in combustion. Such a condition seems\r\nunreasonable to exist in a body traveling unlimited space, which is\r\ncold beyond any degree of ascertaining. The sun is subject to the same\r\nconditions as the Earth, as far as obtaining heat, and this work will\r\nclaim that we receive no more direct heat from the Sun than from Mars\r\nor Venus.\r\n\r\nTaking the first proposition, that in the absence of friction there\r\ncan be no heat or light, the assumption is that the Sun generates its\r\nheat and light by its wonderful revolution in its own atmosphere. With\r\na diameter of 860,000 miles, and revolving in 25.38 days, the Sun is\r\nmoving through its atmosphere a mile in eight-tenths of a second, and\r\nseventy-five miles a minute, and 4,500 per hour.\r\n\r\nWith an atmosphere of relative density of the Earth’s, it is easy to\r\nsee what a pyrotechnical and electrical display this would reveal\r\nto the lens of a telescope, giving the impression of fire on an\r\ninconceivable magnitude. It seems unreasonable that in the realm of\r\nNature anything, or that anywhere fuel can be found for an eternal fire\r\nexcept in an old orthodox Hell.\r\n\r\nTo an observer on Mars or Venus, the earth would, no doubt, present the\r\nsame starlike appearance that those planets do to our earthly eyes.\r\n\r\nThe electrical sparks on a trolley wire or dynamo give the same\r\nexpression to our eyes, though in miniature, with no consciousness of\r\nheat to our feelings.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if, with all the observations of the Sun by telescopes,\r\nwe have gained any knowledge of its structure, but only of its\r\nrevolutions, size and movements, the same as the Earth. It would be\r\na very difficult subject to diagnose clearly as to its productions\r\nof animal and vegetable life. The electrical influences through an\r\natmosphere proportionally deep with ours, with its clouds that must\r\nexist in the same, could very thoroughly obscure the surface of the\r\nSun. Unless at special intervals, when certain exposures would be\r\ncalled Sun-spots, either on a great space of continent or ocean.\r\n\r\nThe great flames of gases in the atmosphere would give the impression,\r\nby telescopic view, of a burning mass, when under these atmospheric\r\nflames all is cool and calm.\r\n\r\nIn the writer’s mind there is no doubt but the Sun is as favorable in\r\ncondition for animal and vegetable life as the Earth, and has both\r\nin proportional greater variety and species. Nature having no limit\r\nto designs, uses no duplicates, never repeats herself in anything.\r\nNo two grains of seed, no two snow flakes, are ever just alike. A\r\nmillion bushels of peas will have no two alike, yet every one has its\r\nindividuality as a pea. Man cannot discriminate one blackbird from\r\nanother in a flock, but to the birds they are as individual as mankind\r\nto each other. For these reasons it is easy to see that every planet\r\nmay be peopled with different varieties of animal and vegetable life as\r\nit is to find the variations in different countries of the Earth. While\r\nthe climate of the Sun may be hotter than that of the Earth, Nature\r\ncan adapt itself to any condition of heat or cold.\r\n\r\nThus far the argument has been chiefly in considering the influence\r\nof heat by friction on planetary surfaces. Later this influence will\r\nbe briefly taken up to demonstrate its interior effect in producing\r\nearthquakes and volcanoes.\r\n\r\nFor a diversion, we will for a while consider the effect of centrifugal\r\nforce on the Earth. The Earth gives many manifestations of said force\r\nin the shape of the continents, courses of rivers, outlets of bays\r\nand ranges of mountains. North America gradually swings to the east\r\nas it approaches the Equator; South America, at the Equator, bulges\r\nmost to the east. The mountain ranges, the Rocky, Sierra Nevada and\r\nCordilleras, in North America, the Andes, in South America, forming a\r\nbarrier against the further encroachment of the Pacific Ocean. The West\r\nCoast of Africa is protected from the Atlantic largely by the mountains\r\nof Morocco, including the Black and White, running south, somewhat\r\nprotecting Senegambia, and then the Kong, with other mountain ranges\r\nin upper and lower Guinea, stop the encroachment on line of Gulf of\r\nGuinea. In Asia, Hindustan has the Ghant Mountains for a barrier, while\r\nanother range of mountains holds the Peninsula of Malacca in place. It\r\nwill be plainly seen that all these points of countries lean toward the\r\nEquatorial center of motion. The islands of Oceanica, strung out on the\r\nline of the Equator, also show the effect of the Earth’s revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Australia is apparently a new production in embryo of\r\na new continent in future connection with some of the large adjacent\r\nislands, and ultimately of most of the island groups of Oceanica. The\r\nsame result is likely to follow with the Greater and Lesser Antilles.\r\n\r\nThe rivers are marked evidence of centrifugal force on both continents.\r\nThe largest, the Amazon, running nearly on line of the Equator and\r\nemptying there. All the rivers, almost without exception, north of the\r\nequator to the Arctic circle run southeast when they can, and at their\r\nmouths tend that way. Those south tend northeast where the face of the\r\ncountry will admit. The Nile, a freak river, is about the only marked\r\nexception. On the north outflows like the Yukon, McKenzie, and Great\r\nFish in North America; the Yenisei and Lena, and many smaller streams\r\nof Europe and Asia flow to the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThese last named streams so far from the great center of motion and on\r\naccount of the marked incline to the country toward the polar centers\r\nhead that way and no doubt contribute largely to the great inflow of\r\nwater to the internal ocean. The west coasts of both continents are\r\nmarked for their dearth of great streams. The open sea that some Arctic\r\nexplorers have presumed to be about the poles is no doubt the beginning\r\nof the fresh water ocean.\r\n\r\nThe open sea problem introduces the importance of this disquisition.\r\nIf there is an open sea, which is in all probability true, it must be\r\nthe open door to an inside world as truly as the coming back from those\r\nhigh latitudes and entering open sea is the evidence of our habitable\r\noutside world.\r\n\r\nWith all deference to the reports of Arctic explorers, it is very\r\ndoubtful if they really know their actual positions or latitudes with\r\nfreaky compasses and unfavorable conditions about them, so that their\r\nstories and adventures while honestly told need to be taken with a\r\ngrain of salt. They tell us of witnessing the breaking off of icebergs\r\nof mammoth size from glaciers, which, no doubt, is true. It would be\r\ntrue if one was seen big as the Capitol at Washington, or as large\r\nas the largest Egyptian pyramid, but doubtful if they ever saw one\r\none-tenth as large as the latter or as large as the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nICEBERGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe venture will be taken here to consider and explain the character\r\nand formation of a big true iceberg which it is supposable change their\r\nlocation to both inside and outside waters.\r\n\r\nAs already said, the ice belt is the dividing line between salt and\r\nfresh waters.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, large expanses of the ocean in the Arctic region\r\nmust be frozen over. As water is an exception to most everything else\r\nby growing lighter as it grows colder, it rises above its water level.\r\nWithout this provision of Nature, our lakes would become solid masses\r\nof ice, and rivers would become mountains, thus extinguishing fish and\r\nproducing a mass so deep and solid that a summer season would hardly\r\nmelt away. This can be evidenced in any tub of water standing out in a\r\ncold night. Water does not congeal entirely on the surface, but rises\r\nin frozen particles from below like cream on milk. This is shown by\r\nits rising and swelling up in the center and pressing the outside of\r\nthe vessel to bursting.\r\n\r\nA pond, lake or river frozen so thickly as to bear up heavy loaded\r\nteams of horses, and armies of men with all their equipages will be\r\nmaterially arched as it leaves the banks. An evidence of this comes\r\nwhen rising and cracking with loud reports and at the thawing up and\r\nyielding of pressure on the banks when loud explosions like blasts or\r\nfiring of cannons will occur, caused by the settling and cracking of\r\nthe ice.\r\n\r\nAs the ocean depths are great and the Arctic night of long duration,\r\nthe fresh-water portions to a great depth congeal, and rising form a\r\nmass of ice inconceivable to temperate climes, both in height and area.\r\nImagine what an iceberg must have been in starting from seventy-fifth\r\nto eightieth parallel of latitude and floated through all kinds of\r\nweather till midsummer, arriving off the coasts of Newfoundland, and\r\nthen 300 to 500 feet high with seven times its height under water and\r\nso large as to take hours and even days or weeks to pass the main mass\r\nof ice and its fragments that have sloughed off. Has any explorer ever\r\nseen such a body of ice break off from a glacier that must have covered\r\nscores of miles square when it started?\r\n\r\nAs an arrow shot into the air bends its course to follow the heavy end,\r\nas truly do the heavy elements in the water manifest themselves at the\r\ncenter of the Earth’s motion, and the saltness of the Equatorial waters\r\nis much stronger than approaching the polar holes, which last term\r\nmight be used with good reason instead of poles.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be with all Arctic explorers the obstacle presenting\r\nitself, termed the ice belt. This obstacle is suggestive, and leads the\r\nway to base the following conclusions:\r\n\r\nThat the water at this point has become so freshened, as to admit of\r\nsuch a wide freezing belt, but that the boundary line is made between\r\nsalt water and fresh.\r\n\r\nIt is not in place here to describe a glacier until the cause and\r\norigin is explained, which will properly come after considering the\r\nwater influences from inside.\r\n\r\nThe next purpose will be to show and aim to prove that the Earth is\r\nhollow and supplied with an ocean of fresh water and habitable land.\r\n\r\nAs said before the theory of an open sea gives the inference of a\r\nnew climate and country, therefore now, what evidence, actual or\r\ncircumstantial can be adduced?\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by Arctic navigators beyond all their attempts to reach\r\nbeyond the ice belt, geese, duck, and other wild fowl continue to fly\r\nand seem to be in quest of food which they must obtain in waters beyond\r\nthe ice belt.\r\n\r\nThe existence of an open sea beyond the ice belt has for years been\r\nconceded. As no explorer has reached much nearer than 750 miles of\r\nthe supposed poles, it is reasonable to suppose that the open sea,\r\nso-called, but really a hole must be nearly fifteen hundred miles in\r\ndiameter. Various evidences have settled that question in the minds of\r\nnavigators, the most important of which is that the sea fowls still fly\r\nbeyond the reach of man’s explorations. The fact alone that wild geese,\r\nducks, and other sea fowl go on to some feeding ground is enough to\r\nsettle all doubts or arguments for or against the theory of an open sea\r\nof fresh water around the supposed poles. Conclusive reasons are that\r\nno water fowl or fish can live in an ocean of salt water. Strictly salt\r\nwaters do not furnish any food; but only in bodies fed by streams of\r\nfresh waters, as in bays, inlets and mouths of rivers, and adjacent to\r\nthe coast line of continents or islands where fresh water from springs\r\nand rainfalls contribute to produce growth and substances suitable for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nIt was observed by the navigator, Ross, that moose, reindeer, wolves,\r\nmusk-ox, white bear, and foxes seek winter quarters toward the north\r\nrather than to the south, and return when the season becomes favorable,\r\nwith their young. Fish are noticed to come south but not to return.\r\n\r\nAs to water fowl, how far they could follow this opening into the\r\ncenter of the Earth, the writer will leave for others to conjecture.\r\n\r\nIt has often been a query from whence came the Arctic elephants, the\r\nremains of which are found so plentifully on the north shores of\r\nSiberia, some of which during the last century have been in such a\r\nstate of preservation as that their flesh was eatable by bears and\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nWhy were they protected by a covering of hair if not originating in a\r\ncolder climate than exists south of the Arctic Circle?\r\n\r\nDo they not still exist in the interior, or have they passed out with\r\nthe great Auk, a former external resident?\r\n\r\nWhy are the latitudes nearest the poles the favorite fishing grounds\r\nfor whales? Is not the interior ocean of fresh water their natural\r\nbreeding ground and from thence passing out through Behring Strait\r\nand other channels into the outer waters? Can some scientist give us\r\nreliable information as to where whales propagate most, and why it is\r\nnecessary for whaling expeditions to seek high latitudes for their\r\ncatch?\r\n\r\nThe hole, fifteen hundred miles across, would not give any conscious\r\nimpression of there being such an opening. You could not stand and\r\ninspect it like looking down a well. This hole opens into a new world\r\nunexplored by man, unless it is possible that Sir John Franklin and the\r\nAeronaut Nansen unintentionally drifted in and were unable to navigate\r\nthemselves out.\r\n\r\nIt must also, in marking out this theory, be admitted that as the\r\ncenter of the Earth is approached this opening must be somewhat\r\nenlarged, and must assume a concave shape from the center; such being\r\nthe case, the diameter must increase from one thousand to two thousand\r\nmiles or more, which is very likely to be the fact. With the motion\r\nor revolution of the Earth, the water would assume this condition on\r\nprinciple of the swinging of a pail of water over the head, and would\r\nmerely be a placid ocean as boundless to the eye as the waters on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIn these expanses of water, it is quite reasonable to presume that\r\nislands and large bodies of land may exist the same as outside, and\r\nthat many fossil specimens thought to have existed on the outer\r\nsurface in an early antiquity may have originated in the center of the\r\nEarth and may even still exist; their ancient skeletons having been\r\nthrown to the Earth’s surface by the centrifugal forces of water in\r\nthe same way that all the different stratas of rock have been cast up\r\nand mixed in one grand conglomeration from the Earth’s center to its\r\ncircumference. These facts seem clearly to prove by these migratory\r\nbirds and animals: First an open sea; second it must be fresh water or\r\nmostly so; third, it must produce or contain desirable food elements\r\ndifferent from what exist in the ocean on the outside, on which these\r\nbirds can live when they reach their breeding grounds from which\r\nthey are reported to return with largely augmented numbers. Now this\r\nconsistent query can arise: Do they stop at a near point after passing\r\nthis great boundary line of ice and find suitable and pleasant feeding\r\ngrounds, or go on 500 or 1,000 miles farther? At that distance, the\r\nwater is more likely to be modified in temperature and better adapted\r\nto their tastes and comfort. It seems quite right to assume that they\r\ncome to inland seas, and pleasant bays, and sounds supplied with food\r\nfrom their shores and feeding grounds, rather than being supplied with\r\nanything existing on external parts of the Earth; otherwise, their\r\nsupply must all be drawn under the ice belt or pass through this great\r\nArctic filter. Again this thought comes up. How did these birds get\r\nsight of or learn of this internal feeding, and probably breeding\r\nground? As migratory birds usually fly at great height, they would have\r\nan advantage over man in seeing this open ocean, as it is reasonable\r\nto think they may have bred as well as fed there. It is only a natural\r\nsequence of their migration in and out of this belt or ice circle, just\r\nas we recognize their flight north and south with the season’s changes.\r\n\r\nIf they go there by instinct, they merely do what is credited to the\r\nrealm of life, considered lower in the scale of thoughts than man;\r\nbut if by exploration and reason, then man must take a lower scale in\r\ncalculation than the goose. To conclude this point. If birds live on\r\nvegetation, there must be an abundant supply of fresh water to produce\r\nit. If they live on fish, there must be the same sufficiency of fresh\r\nwater in which to breed, feed, and live. If the birds breed, they must\r\nhave hospitable shores on which to dwell and rest, and favoring skies\r\nto contribute to their various wants in order to exist.\r\n\r\nTheir instincts or reason will never take them where the conditions\r\nwill not admit of food and drink, rest, shelter, and protection.\r\n\r\nOne other conclusive evidence that our icebergs are not formed by the\r\nbreaking off from the terminals of glaciers is the fact of frequently\r\nfinding them in midocean carrying such passengers as wolves, foxes,\r\nwhite bear, and other specimens of Arctic animals. The solidity of the\r\niceberg is much against the glacial origin, the glacier being made up\r\nof a conglomerate mass formed by snow, rain and spring waters, so much\r\nso as to be impossible to keep intact to any great bulk. The formation\r\nof the iceberg in its method must be a solid mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nGULF STREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first witness from the interior will be the Gulf Stream, the most\r\nphenomenal stream of water known to the Earth. This great outlet,\r\nauthorities tell us, is the result of waters rushing around from the\r\nCaribbean Sea through the Gulf of Mexico and out through the Strait of\r\nFlorida, thus giving force enough to be manifest for more than three\r\nthousand miles to the coast of Ireland to give her the climate that\r\nchristened her the Emerald Isle; from Ireland and the British Isles,\r\nits influence is felt to the coast of Norway.\r\n\r\nThe water is much warmer than at other points after leaving the Bahamas\r\nwith different marine conditions, such as containing no jelly fish,\r\nor showing sparkling waters by night and being always avoided by the\r\nwhales and other tenants that are in adjoining waters. It is also\r\nclaimed by those who have sailed many times through it that the color\r\nof the water is so different as to be quickly noticeable as vessels\r\nenter the Stream. How such a stream can originate with such force in\r\na reservoir like the Atlantic, connected around through the Caribbean\r\nSea and returning to itself, is as obscure to the writer’s mind as to\r\nhow a man can succeed in lifting himself in a bushel basket. A man that\r\ncan adopt this conclusion ought to apply his energies to developing a\r\nmachine for perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream is, no doubt, an enormous spring tainted with sulphur,\r\nlike many of the springs in Florida and up the coast as far as\r\nCharleston, whose waters are warmed from the same influence as the\r\nGulf Stream, from passing up through a deep strata heated by volcanic\r\ninfluences so common in Central America. Its sulphurous taint will\r\naccount for the absence of whales and jelly fish in its waters, in\r\nwhich waters of similar nature fish are never found. This sulphurous\r\ncondition may account for the stormy features that prevail along its\r\ncourse. It may be claimed that the waters would smell of sulphur so as\r\nto be detected, but such is not necessarily the case; from springs in\r\nFlorida that flow strong sulphurous water, many visitors will not drink\r\nat the spring, but after aërating an hour, it will be drank at hotel\r\ntables and from water urns without a suspicion of its being sulphurous.\r\nThe contact with salt water at the great depth from which the Stream\r\noriginates diminishes any odor before reaching the surface and quite\r\nlikely imparts the noticeable change in color. The deep-sea soundings\r\noff the coast of Bahama is another reason that the Stream originates\r\nthere. It is claimed to be almost impossible at the commencement of the\r\nstream to get reliable soundings, as evidently sounding leads would be\r\nsensibly affected by the powerful current of water flowing outward.\r\n\r\nThe next evidence offered is, where does the enormous amount of water\r\ncome from to supply our lake systems? Nearly all of the large lakes\r\nof the world are located in the highest parts. Lake Geneva 1,226 feet\r\nabove the sea level, receives the muddy waters of the Rhone, but has\r\nso much other inflow as a spring as to discharge its waters blue and\r\nclear. Lake Constance is 1,290 feet above the sea and 912 feet deep;\r\nthe Rhine rising at an elevation of 7,600 feet enters this lake. In\r\n1770, the waters rose in one hour twenty feet above ordinary limit. It\r\nis said to contain twenty-five species of fish, including salmon. Onega\r\nand Ladoga are high from sea levels, and by canal, connect with some\r\nof the headwaters of the Volga. Titicaca, 12,800 feet above the sea,\r\n720 feet deep near the shore, and probably very deep in the middle,\r\ncontains many islands and abounds in remains of Peruvian architecture.\r\nSuperior, 627 feet above the sea and mean depth about 1,000 feet, never\r\nfreezing over except about the shores, and presents a temperature of\r\nabout 45 degrees.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few in different countries to which the position is\r\nuniversal, for both great bodies of fresh water as well as small ones,\r\nas the general impression with people is that lakes are usually in low\r\nlands, while the opposite is the true state.\r\n\r\nHow few people in this country ever thought of our great internal\r\nseas of fresh water, Superior, Huron, Michigan, and Ontario, being on\r\nthe highest lands between the ocean and the Rocky Mountains, yet such\r\nis the case. From these great fountains flow the waters that plunge\r\ndown Niagara Falls, while a larger portion, it is thought, has a\r\nsubterranean outlet through Lake Ontario, and uniting with the Niagara\r\ncurrent to form the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nWhence come these waters into those great lakes? They have no important\r\nrivers flowing in, and their waters are frequently highest in August\r\nand September when the country is commonly suffering by drouth. If the\r\nsupply were rain water, this whole surface would freeze, but spring\r\nwater is exempt until well exposed to the air for some time. The lands\r\nabout Lake Superior rise quite abruptly, and as you ascend the hills,\r\nand riding from Ashland to Duluth, will see hundreds of small lakes,\r\nand from Two Harbors north as you ascend for fifty miles you see the\r\nsame state of things till you come to the divide within less than 100\r\nmiles, when the waters go west into the Mississippi valley and north\r\nto Hudson Bay, and east and south to the Atlantic. Are these lakes\r\nsupplied with rain and snows? If so, where does the water collect, and\r\nhow does it get into this elevation? A subterranean river is supposed\r\nto run between Superior and Ontario, on account of similar fish being\r\ncaught in each lake at particular seasons, but absent in Ontario at\r\nother times.\r\n\r\nThe lakes named are only mentioned for their importance; we will now\r\ncall attention to lakes universally. Whoever reads this subject will be\r\nobliged to come to only one conclusion as to the general locality of\r\nlakes. Take our Adirondack region, with its thousands of pure, clear\r\nlakes hidden away among the rugged hills. The White mountain country\r\nwhere lakes abound. Chautauqua on its elevated ground, Mt. Desert in\r\nthe ocean with its Eagle lake and others 1,200 feet above the sea.\r\nLakes and living ponds, full of lilies, on Block Island. All through\r\nthe mountains and wilds of Maine, and so on in every state the same\r\ncondition exists, till you get to the level and prairie states where\r\nupheavals are rare for producing lakes and springs.\r\n\r\nIf a reader will peruse in “Picturesque America” the descriptive scenes\r\non the French Broad River and the wonders through Delaware Water Gap,\r\nit is very doubtful if the various displays of waterfalls and profusion\r\nof springs and lakes will impress him with the idea that they are to\r\nbe attributed to special rainfall in that locality. One particular\r\nevidence ought to be enough to dispel any such conclusion.\r\n\r\nTo quote from page 100: “As one of the wonders of the Gap must be\r\ncounted the marvelous lake upon Tammany; a lake so singular that\r\npopular superstition has been tempted to add a final touch to its\r\nsurpassing strangeness, and declare it has no bottom. As if in quaint\r\nclimax to her wild work, Nature, after riving the mountain to its very\r\nbase, here places beside the chasm on the very apex of the lofty peak a\r\npeaceful lake.”\r\n\r\nThis feature of lakes could be extended indefinitely, but something\r\nmust be said about the smaller influences that produce them. Every\r\nlake is but a mammoth spring, or reservoir of numerous springs that\r\nfeed into its base. The provision by nature of this inexhaustible\r\nreservoir of fresh water is beyond doubt the most essential of any\r\nother bounty bestowed upon every living thing on Earth’s surface. The\r\nprinciple of centrifugal motion and power is here developed to its\r\nhighest advantage.\r\n\r\nEvery man that has ever turned a grindstone at early morning to\r\nprepare a dull scythe for its day’s work, has no doubt observed the\r\nresult of frequent pouring on of water. If he turned slow, it would\r\ndrizzle off at the bottom, supposed to obey the Law of Gravitation;\r\nbut if he turned just fast enough, he could keep about a pint of\r\nwater on the surface of a stone four inches thick and two feet in\r\ndiameter. Increasing the speed results in throwing the water off in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nIf yarn or cloth wet from a tank or vat is put in a tub latticed\r\noutside and subjected to rapid revolutions, it can be thoroughly dried\r\nin a brief time. The process of separating cream from milk is done on\r\nthe same principle by which butter can be made in ten minutes’ time\r\nfrom milking.\r\n\r\nThe familiar trick of whirling a pail of water over one’s head, is\r\ncomplete proof in itself that water seeks the surface and center of\r\nmotion, and that all these results are from centrifugal force. A funnel\r\nof large, or any capacity, filled and a plug at the bottom removed to\r\nadmit its discharge, will evidence that motion at once forms a circle,\r\nand that the center is bare while the outside is full.\r\n\r\nAt this point it may be well to call attention to another feature in\r\nthe river system. The water on the grindstone will give force to this\r\nsuggestion. At a certain speed the water will tend to the outside of\r\nthe stone; below speed required to do that, the tendency will be toward\r\nthe center of the stone, or strictly toward the center of the Earth’s\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what the river system says. Look on your maps and see\r\nabout where the common divide occurs, which is seemingly not far from\r\nthe 50th parallel, where centrifugal force is apparently not strong\r\nenough to carry the waters toward the Equator, and the principal waters\r\nflow toward Symmes’s Hole.\r\n\r\nLook on your maps.\r\n\r\nOn the 40th parallel sailors have what they call a roaring sea, which\r\nis approximately near the divide of waters, going either toward the\r\npoles or toward the Equator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nDAILY MOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature seems to have just the right adjustment in all its affairs,\r\nwhether in coloring of flowers, season for growth, flavoring of fruits,\r\nsupplies for animal and vegetable life, and instincts for everything\r\ncreated, to adapt them to living purposes.\r\n\r\nSo in the Earth’s diurnal revolution of 24 hours, supposing it was\r\nslowed to 25 hours, we should have less wind and tides, less warmth and\r\nmore land free from the encroachment of the sea.\r\n\r\nIncrease the speed to 23 hours would give us more warmth by greater\r\nfriction, increase the flow of our springs, give higher tides, and make\r\nmost of the present commercial seaports of the world take seats farther\r\nback, as millions of acres of land now available would be flooded every\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nThe moon, we are told, has little or no atmosphere. It is pronounced\r\ncold and uninhabitable. This all looks reasonable. Being only a little\r\nover 2,000 miles in diameter and a revolution about like the Earth\r\nthrough a thin atmosphere, it is easy to see the lack of friction to\r\nproduce warmth, and therewith the proper constituents to sustain life.\r\nThis is an easy one and readily disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if the Earth’s crust exceeds, or equals 1,000 miles in\r\nthickness. The outside is held from flying to pieces by the atmosphere,\r\nwhich is a sort of tire to the earth, while the inside is constantly\r\npressing from effect of centrifugal force. These two factors must meet\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nOn the outside, near the ice belt, the water pressure gets the best of\r\nthe inner forces and drives the waters into Symmes’s Hole. In the Earth\r\nthe centrifugal force has advantage until reaching the surface; but if\r\na big hole could be cut at the Equator through to the center, no doubt\r\na man could jump into it in safety and cease to fall as he cushioned\r\nagainst centrifugal influence in his descent. Earthquakes are only the\r\neffects of internal pressure of water to get to the surface, at times\r\nbursting large reservoirs, producing tremblings, and at others with\r\ngreat force throwing up hills and mountains from the tops of which the\r\nfountains of water burst forth. At other times they are produced by\r\nthe contact of water with heated elements in volcanoes, creating the\r\ncommotion leading to the volcanic eruption, the latter of which can\r\nonly be produced by contact of fire and water.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that this is the complete and brief explanation of\r\nearthquake causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volcano is nothing more than a local fire, as much in connection\r\nwith the Earth’s surface as the furnace fire built in a man’s basement\r\nto warm his house, or in his stove to cook his breakfast. When the fuel\r\nthat is used in either one is consumed, the fire goes out, which is a\r\ncommon result in both cases. Of all the volcanoes known to have existed\r\nas evidenced by their craters, fully three-fourths have become extinct.\r\n\r\nNow what causes the volcano? The Earth is filled with immense supplies\r\nof fuel, consisting in stores of coal, sulphur, oil, gas, limestone,\r\netc. While it is claimed that at the imaginary axis of the Earth there\r\ncan be no friction, yet when the surface is approached with all its\r\nweight of mountains and continents, here friction begins to put in its\r\nwork. It is very doubtful if any volcano exists, or ever has existed\r\nwhose fires go to the depth of 500 miles, and more likely not half\r\nthat distance.\r\n\r\nOn the outside of this circle, of 25,000 miles it is only reasonable\r\nto expect an enormous strain. The abrasion of limestone found in huge\r\nmasses will, by process of heat, convert them into lime. The contact\r\nwith water, universal throughout the Earth, will start the volcano,\r\nwhich by slaking, this small amount of rock converted into lime will\r\ngenerate a heat that may ignite and produce more lime, or reach other\r\ncombustibles, which may be set on fire by this; or when in contact\r\nwith other substances, this would lead to reservoirs of oil and gas,\r\nand deposits of coal and sulphur. These when ignited may remain in\r\na slight slumbering condition and burn for ages, but water will be\r\nthe constant aggressor and from time to time will manifest itself\r\nby coming in contact with these burning forces thus producing the\r\nvolcanic eruptions and in time will be the conqueror, and the crater\r\nof the volcano will become a lake, of which evidences exist all over\r\nthe Earth. That volcanoes are only local, the same as fires in our\r\nhouses, is fully evident from the fact that they burn, and go out. This\r\ntheory of producing volcanic eruptions can be easily demonstrated in\r\nevery kitchen or casting shop in the country. Kettles of hot fat or\r\nmelted metals when brought in contact with water will cause a miniature\r\neruption at short notice. It is common to speak of volcanoes emitting\r\nsmoke, but it is rare that such cases are ever a fact, but instead of\r\nsmoke, we should say steam. The result of friction to produce effects,\r\nwe claim, is well illustrated in shipments of cotton. Cotton shipped\r\nfrom India in the vessel’s hold, rarely, if ever, takes fire. From\r\nthis country it is no unusual thing, and why? In India they bind the\r\nbales with jute or hemp, while in this country with straps of iron. In\r\nthe ship’s hold, there is, of course, a constant motion and rubbing\r\ntogether of great weight of bales which ofttimes generates the fire\r\nin the cargo. This is the way the volcano is started, but sooner or\r\nlater, water will put it out. All volcanic eruptions are credited with\r\nthrowing out great volumes of water, steam, mud, ashes, stones, lava\r\nand sulphur. During earthquake convulsions which generally precede\r\nvolcanic eruptions, the world over there is a bursting out of fresh\r\nsprings as well as an increase in the present existing flows.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE VOLCANOES FOR?\r\n\r\nIf they are, as is claimed by some, for vents to the interior molten\r\ncondition, why do they become extinct, so many of them, and almost\r\ninvariably become lakes inside their craters?\r\n\r\nWith the whole center of the Earth a molten mass, there ought to be\r\nfire enough to keep them going incessantly. Where does the water come\r\nfrom to keep up a constant outpour of steam and vapor in locations\r\nwhere it seldom rains?\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if the small amount of rain or snow that fell would\r\nget pretty well dried out before it arrived at a point to create an\r\neruption by contact with melted rock, or that such a quantity could\r\nkeep up steam in such an immense cauldron. There is no reason to\r\npresume that a drop of rain water ever enters a volcanic crater, except\r\nwhat may fall into its open mouth, which will be impossible.\r\n\r\nHave Volcanoes any specific use in Earth economics? Do they tend to\r\nopen up water courses from the interior and by their upheavals on the\r\ncontinents and islands of the Earth create natural elevated reservoirs\r\nfrom which the lower regions of Earth can be irrigated? Do they not\r\nsend out certain gases to mingle in the atmosphere, producing favorable\r\nresults in vegetation and animal life? Are not the vicinities of\r\nvolcanoes noted for the fine fruits and wines in latitudes in which\r\nthey grow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nRAINFALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter being devoted to rainfalls, a few introductory\r\nobservations may be in order. The essential need on Earth’s surface for\r\ngrowth of vegetation, and the sustenance of life, depending thereon\r\nin some form, is in universal irrigation, which Nature failed to\r\nfurnish by its internal provision of water with its outflow of springs\r\nand lakes, except by artificial use. The rainfall on the Earth is no\r\nmore intended for filling of springs, lakes and seas than it is for\r\nsupplying us with fuel. It is simply a provision for surface watering\r\nof vegetation, and has no more effect on the existence of living\r\nsprings and subterranean outflow of water than the eclipse of the moon.\r\nThere never was a rainfall, except, perhaps, in Noah’s time, that wet\r\nthe general surface of the country to the depth of three feet, and\r\nrarely one-half of that. It is generally called a good, soaking rain\r\nthat moistens the bottom of the potato hills, and to wet what the soil\r\nwill hold one to two feet requires a prodigious amount of water. It\r\nis claimed by proprietors of orange groves that a volume of water of\r\nsix inches in depth is requisite to thoroughly irrigate the grove. If\r\nthe claim that rain has no effect on the supplies of springs and lakes\r\nbe true, you will ask why it is that after a long drouth and a heavy\r\nrainfall, the springs resume running, and water returns into wells\r\nthat have for a time been dry? The effect on those sources of supply\r\nis simply the same as results from wetting a sponge to take up water\r\nwhich will not absorb and be taken up in a dry one. You can easily be\r\nconvinced of this effect. To show that water will run uphill or away\r\nfrom the Earth: The surface of the Earth becoming saturated, and in\r\nsome places penetrating into the seams and crevices of rock and soil,\r\nat once forms a medium of attraction for the waters below to follow.\r\nAnother valid reason is the general condition of the atmosphere from\r\nthe time of drouth to a condition of moisture when it becomes really a\r\nmammoth sponge after being dampened. Against the claim that rainfall\r\nhas little or no influence in raising or producing springs or lakes, or\r\nliving wells, this question naturally arises regarding springs, which\r\nhas in a measure been answered. It is, however, a pertinent question,\r\nand a pleasant one to answer fully.\r\n\r\nIn the summer season, most commonly of any, the air becomes hot\r\nand dry. The surface of the Earth loses the moisture of the air’s\r\ninfluence, together with the Sun’s heat evaporating the dampness,\r\nbecomes generally arid, and fails thereby to be a conductor of the\r\nmoisture from below.\r\n\r\nAs a season of very dry atmosphere occurs for months at times, the\r\nsoil becomes correspondingly dry and dusty to quite a depth. From this\r\ncause the springs and water in wells recede and sink away. It is an\r\neasy matter to find people who have witnessed the following seeming\r\nphenomena in times of drouth: After a period of weeks or months of\r\ndrouth before any rainfall has occurred at all, the fountains, long\r\ndry, often commence to run, and wells begin to fill with water, and\r\nthis without a drop of rain.\r\n\r\nJust here comes the pleasant task of answering the question fully: How\r\ncan this occur without a soaking rain?\r\n\r\nAt such times, when the Earth and all nature is thirsting for water,\r\nand every fountain seems to have dried up forever, the day will come\r\nwhich will bring these evidences.\r\n\r\nThe aged will complain of their rheumatism; men’s bones will ache;\r\ngeese will wash in the dust; the peacock will scream; birds, beasts and\r\nvegetation will feel a humidity in the air and intuitions that rain is\r\nnear. As the atmosphere has felt the approach and preparation for rain\r\nsome time in advance, so all Nature feels its effects. To illustrate\r\nthe burned or dry condition of the air, you may consider this test:\r\nTake a pail of water, and a dry sponge, big as your head, and lay the\r\nsponge on the surface, and it will take a long time for the sponge to\r\nabsorb the water and become fully saturated. Wet the sponge before the\r\ntest and squeeze it dry as you can, and lay it on, and it will fill\r\nrapidly and quickly. Pour a pail of water on the floor and try the same\r\nexperiment. Your sponge will not fill at all if dry, only a little as\r\nit comes in contact with the water; but moisten it as before, and press\r\nit nearly dry, and throw on the puddle of water, and it will drink\r\nitself full at once, drawing up the water like a pump. You cannot wipe\r\nup a floor with a dry sponge.\r\n\r\nThe springs and wells that have dried and receded a short distance from\r\ntheir usual level from lack of moisture in the air that penetrates the\r\nsurface, quickly feel a returning moist condition and are drawn by the\r\nsame influence upward as the water climbs up through the damp sponge.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere performs the same duty as the sponge, and this answers\r\nwhy the springs and wells resume running before a drop of rain has\r\nfallen, and which, when it comes in copious quantities, still adds to\r\nthe general effect of making a stronger draft on the fountains below.\r\n\r\nAnother question proper to ask scientists is this: If the rainfall\r\naffects springs and lakes, how is it that the analysis of mineral\r\nsprings in all quarters of the globe is not affected by every change of\r\nseason? How can the waters of Saratoga, Carlsbad, Waukeska, Kissengen\r\nor of any other such spring be relied on for uniform assays? How can\r\nthis great variety of springs come in such near proximity to each\r\nother and possess such distinctive curative properties as at Saratoga,\r\nfor example? Within a radius of two or three miles are springs, one\r\nof which is a cathartic, another a diuretic, another emetic, another\r\ntonic, and so on, no two alike, but retain their individuality through\r\nall times, wet or dry? They are affected only in amount of flow by the\r\nsame atmospheric conditions of either dryness or moisture, as just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nWhen the atmosphere is heavily charged with moisture, it becomes\r\na mammoth sponge, and this condition of air, evidently, is what\r\nprecipitates thunder showers in the summer. As all the hills and\r\nmountains are the result of water upheavals, they are for this reason\r\nthe reservoirs of water for watering the Earth, and therefore quicker\r\nto respond to atmospheric conditions than the plains.\r\n\r\nIt is almost without exception that thunder showers form their nucleus\r\non the heads of mountains and the tops of hills.\r\n\r\nAfter a shower let us see the condition and results. The face of Nature\r\nsmiles after its refreshing wash; every tree and plant has drunk\r\nits foliage full of new life; the air’s sultriness has changed to\r\nfreshness. All animated life seems to take a fresh lease, and as the\r\nclouds roll away and the quickly swollen streams rush to the rivers,\r\nlakes and oceans, it seems as if almost a deluge had passed by.\r\n\r\nThe remarks, “What a lovely shower!” “What a much needed rain!” “What\r\nlots of good it will do!” etc., pass between neighbors. Farmer Smith\r\ncomes along and says, in reply to the shower being such a cracker, that\r\nhe went into his garden to set out cabbage plants, and down little over\r\nan inch the ground was dry as powder; that while this will do lots of\r\ngood to grass, and “sich,” it wants a good soaker to get down to the\r\nbottom of the potato hills.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of most of our copious showers that flood\r\neverything for half an hour, but not a drop reaches the roots of forest\r\ntrees of any depth, or does anything more than to temporarily wet and\r\nfreshen the surface.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case on the prairies and unbroken plains, the\r\nevaporation of two or three days’ sun leaves them in almost the\r\ncondition of a desert. This was the case in our new States, Nebraska,\r\nKansas, Colorado and Indian Territory, which, now so productive, were,\r\nas our early Geography describes them, before the soil was broken to\r\nhold the rain for a while, the Great American Desert.\r\n\r\nOn a hot day the air in the valleys is still and suffocating. Climbing\r\nup from the valley to the hill or mountain tops, you find a cool and\r\nrefreshing breeze; the moisture in the air is becoming condensed.\r\nHere is where the philosophy of lightning seems to work a prominent\r\npart. The cold currents of air and moisture, collecting, seem to come\r\nin contact with this subtle and wonderful agent, and the result is\r\nlike fire to powder, a vivid flash and explosion. Stand on the plain\r\non a sultry day and watch that little white crest of what we call a\r\nthunderhead. The farmer who has hay down will notice it with a little\r\nanxiety. The sailor will think of his sails, and the picnickers will\r\nthink about going home. Soon a flash, and a dark base is forming. Soon\r\nthe rumble of thunder is heard; the girls with their bonnets on begin\r\nto look worried. The captain on his yacht is giving orders to reef\r\nsails, and Farmer Jones and his boys are cocking and pitching hay for\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nThe little white-capped clouds of an hour ago have turned into a black\r\nand threatening massed park of artillery. Every discharge deepens and\r\ndarkens the advancing column.\r\n\r\nJust as the vessel’s sails are dropped and snugly reefed, just as the\r\nfarmer rushes his team, with load of hay or grain, into his barn,\r\nand the picnic is almost under cover, the big drops of rain begin to\r\npatter. Another flash and quick report; a scream from the girls, nearly\r\nas sharp, and they rush for shelter, and down comes a torrent of rain.\r\n\r\nA slight cessation, another flash, and, like shaking a tree of fruit,\r\nevery electrical explosion seems to shake down a fresh reserve of rain\r\ndrops. This is in keeping with the theory that after great battles the\r\ncannonading produces a copious rainfall.\r\n\r\nIt is a method at times adopted by military garrisons when destitute of\r\nwater, when the atmosphere is in a favorable condition for rain, to get\r\nout a battery of artillery and have a season of vigorous firing, and\r\ngenerally with successful results.\r\n\r\nAnd while all this grand and complete arrangement supplies vegetation\r\nwith its bathing and drinking, as said before, it has nothing to do\r\nwith the living and lasting supply of our springs, lakes and rivers.\r\nThey are fed from a never failing and almost unchanging source--that\r\nis, by the immense supply taken in at the polar holes in a river over\r\n4,000 miles wide at each end of the Earth’s axis.\r\n\r\nThat the presumption of rainfall furnishing the supply for all of\r\nour lakes, springs and wells has never been questioned seems almost\r\ndiscreditable to the observing talent of our age. Whatever the\r\ncharacter of rainfall, either by protracted storm or sudden and copious\r\nshowers, it cannot escape our notice that the largest portion of the\r\nwater runs from the highlands to the lowlands into the gulches and\r\nsmall streams, and thence to the rivers, into the ocean; so that the\r\npercentage of water retained by the soil is much smaller than that\r\nwhich runs away.\r\n\r\nIn our Western prairies, the country formerly called the Indian\r\nTerritory, the soil was covered with an almost waterproof matting of\r\ngrass roots, on which, when showers fell, the penetration was so slight\r\nthat in a very few days evaporation left them parched and dried. Since\r\nthe settling up of our territories, which were once termed deserts, the\r\nsoil has been broken by the farmer’s plow, thus admitting the rainfall\r\nto be longer retained in the surface soil, which fact has led to the\r\ndevelopment of lands once considered barren to become some of the most\r\nfruitful grounds in our domain.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar feature of climatic change may be mentioned here,\r\nwhereas until recent years thunder showers and storms were almost\r\nunknown in many of our Western States and in the Pacific States also,\r\ntill now these storms and showers, with their electrical disturbances,\r\nare nearly as common as in older States.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of weather which has seemed to develop in recent years\r\nis that of milder winters in our Northern States and colder freaks in\r\nthe Southern; snows and frosts reaching States which rarely ever had\r\nsuch experiences, and the burdens of snows becoming much less in States\r\nwhich always expected a long season of sleighing.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to venture the following reasons as conducive to much\r\nof this change in weather conditions of the country at large. First,\r\nthe general denuding of our forests, which evidently has much influence\r\non the water courses. Next, the settling up of the whole country, and\r\nlocation of cities and towns from ocean to ocean, all quite evenly\r\ndistributed, and in a great portion of them large amounts of machinery,\r\ncomposed of iron and steel, producing a great amount of friction and\r\nelectrical influence in their workings; besides the almost innumerable\r\nfires from furnaces, factories and households, discharging their heat\r\ninto the upper air. Again, the railroad system, with its millions of\r\ntons of steel rails, make a magnetic connection between every State\r\nand almost every county in forming one grand combination. The rush\r\nof thousands of trains all over the country, with their friction by\r\nwheels on the tracks, and the rush through the atmosphere, cannot\r\nfail to influence in largely equalizing the same. Still another\r\npotent influence must exist in the almost unlimited number of wires\r\nfor telephone and telegraph purposes, which make all the electrical\r\ncombinations more complete than anything else. If all these things\r\ncombine, it does not seem strange that magnetic and electric currents\r\nand conditions of our weather throughout the country should be somewhat\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nSPRINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person in full enjoyment of health rarely ever appreciates it to\r\nthe fullness that he will on being deprived of it and have its welcome\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe bounties of Nature are so great and common that they fail to\r\nattract our attention to the extent of some trifles that come new into\r\nour way from day to day. One of the greatest provisions of Nature,\r\nas universal as air and Earth, is the millions of springs gushing up\r\nthrough the pores of the Earth in every country and clime. To make\r\nthis provision of fresh water ample, needs very large reservoirs for\r\nsupplies. The amplitude of this reservoir, if the situation is as\r\nclaimed in this book, it is believed everybody will admit. To prove\r\nthat this supply comes from such a general source a class of witnesses\r\nmust be brought out. One of the most important must be the feeding\r\nof our great lakes on high altitudes. These great bodies of fresh\r\nwater are universally credited with enormous depths of pure, clear\r\nwater, such as never could exist as the result of shed water. Many of\r\nthem practically have no streams feeding them, but, without regard to\r\nweather conditions of seasons, pour forth enormous bodies of water\r\nwithout change of volume. Lake Superior will be taken again as a\r\nprominent witness. Here is an inland sea, on the highest ground between\r\nthe ocean and Rocky Mountains, so large that vessels can sail on it for\r\ndays out of sight of land. Not a river of any importance flows into it,\r\nthe country around it not admitting the formation of a large stream.\r\n\r\nThe water during the hottest summer months sustains a uniform\r\ntemperature of forty-five degrees, and is as clear as crystal.\r\n\r\nThe outflow from this lake furnishes the great river passing through\r\nthe Sault Ste. Marie, through which passes a greater tonnage of vessels\r\nthan through the Suez canal, and most of them of very large draft. This\r\nriver with the combined waters of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron passes\r\non through the Detroit River and Lake Erie and over Niagara Falls. It\r\nis also claimed that from Lake Superior a large subterranean stream\r\nflows into Lake Ontario from which lake the stream in junction with\r\nNiagara river forms the St. Lawrence, the river so copious in its flow\r\nas to be immune from floods.\r\n\r\nThis question is in point: Where does this enormous supply of water\r\ncome from to supply Lake Superior?\r\n\r\nWithout taking single witnesses, we will call up groups. Take the\r\nvarious great lakes of the world, Europe, Asia and Africa, where all\r\ngreat rivers seem to have their sources in some lake.\r\n\r\nAs to rainfall if that originates these streams, and if so, how is\r\ntheir flow kept so uniform, or is it from a steady, unfailing source,\r\nas would come from the inside ocean of supply?\r\n\r\nLakes of enormous depth exist in the Sierra Nevada, and Rocky\r\nMountains, as Pyramid Lake, Donner, Tahoe and Crater Lakes. In our\r\nAdirondacks are thousands of lakes, in Vermont and New Hampshire,\r\nand in the White Mountain region, throughout the mountain portions\r\nof Maine, in West Virginia, and the Carolinas, and in other high and\r\nmountainous sections lakes abound. As we come to the low country there\r\nare few witnesses to call, as the only body of water worth mentioning\r\nis in Utah, that lake being salt and below the level of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWhile the subject of this chapter is introduced under the heading of\r\nsprings, it may seem out of place to bring in these great lakes,\r\nassuming that they are of the same class. But there is no doubt\r\nwhatever of their being nothing more or less than mammoth springs.\r\n\r\nNext to the great lake system of the world, may be called in evidence\r\nthe atolls so prevalent in the southern Pacific Ocean and growing also\r\nin other places on the globe. These peculiar features appear to have\r\nbeen built up from the tops of submarine mountains or old craters that\r\nhave been filled with fresh water, from which structures of coral have\r\ngrown till they reached the surface. The formation of these atolls\r\nbeing generally elongated, or in chains like mountain ranges, is\r\nsuggestive of the same influence in their inception as the upheaval of\r\nmountain chains on land surfaces by hydraulic pressure.\r\n\r\nThis may be a good place to ask where the fresh water supply comes from\r\nto produce these atolls. That they are produced by fresh water there\r\ncan be no question, as the work of coral is never performed without\r\nan abundance of this element to build through. That the bottom of the\r\nocean has many subterranean rivers nobody will dispute. That nearly\r\nevery island in the ocean has springs of fresh water, none can deny.\r\nWhere does it come from? Many of these islands have thermal springs,\r\nlike Iceland with its geysers of many varieties. Some with common\r\nfresh water, and nearby springs of mineral water. One familiar to this\r\nregion is Block Island with both fresh water and mineral springs, and\r\nlittle lakes on the high ground alive with fresh water fish. Are they\r\nsupplied with rain water?\r\n\r\nMount Desert is a very good witness to call. Here is an island eighteen\r\nmiles in diameter surrounded by salt water with an elevation of 1,800\r\nfeet, and 1,200 feet above the ocean are three fine lakes, Eagle Lake,\r\nCrooked Lake, and Echo Lake. In which lakes are trout weighing eight or\r\nten pounds. On this small island are to be found thousands of springs\r\npouring out from every crack and crevice. The water is pure and clear\r\nas in all such cases. Where does it come from? No more generous gift to\r\nman and all animated nature, has been bestowed by Providence than the\r\nuniversal distribution of springs all over the world.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty rods of the top of Mount Washington, the highest peak in\r\nthe New England States, flows out a copious spring of water. The whole\r\nmountain system is full of springs and lakes. The entire Adirondack\r\nregion is in the same condition. It is safe to leave it to the reader\r\nwho has ever been out of sight of the smoke of his own chimney to\r\nthink of the abundance of instances where he has seen lakes and springs\r\non the tops of high hills, where no shed water to any extent could\r\nreach them, and wonder how they came there.\r\n\r\nTo assume that rains sink into the ground and form water supplies,\r\nseems incredible when the experience of any man who has ever dug a\r\nwell or sunk a shaft in a mountain, or tunneled under a hill ought to\r\ndisprove such an idea at once. As we dig down we always meet water,\r\nand the deeper we get the more we find. Where does the water from the\r\nsurface turn around to come back? Some of the water coming up is salt,\r\nsome fresh, some hot, but mostly of a uniform coolness of about fifty\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nGLACIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hear a great deal said about the age of Glaciers. This is assuming\r\nthat the Earth has at some time been in a condition to be almost\r\nuninhabitable, as evidences of this Glacial influence seem to be\r\nreported from all parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nAs the theory of a warmer climate having existed in primeval times and\r\nthat the Earth is and has been for ages cooling off hardly leaves a\r\nplace for a universal period of Glaciers.\r\n\r\nIt hardly seems rational that the vast accumulation of flora to produce\r\nthe coal deposits and sustain the wonderful specimens of animal and\r\nreptile growth could have been interrupted by a period of ice. If so,\r\nthe earth in its present condition shows evidence of growing warmer\r\ninstead of cooling off.\r\n\r\nIt is by the writer seriously doubted that the many evidences\r\nattributed to glaciers can be charged to their influence.\r\n\r\nWhere large rocks are found foreign to anything in their immediate\r\nsurroundings and similar to formations at quite long distances away,\r\nthe explanation that the straggling specimens were carried there by\r\nglaciers is not necessarily conclusive.\r\n\r\nThere may be many instances where such evidences are the work of\r\nglaciers, but it does not seem as if an ice age were needful to produce\r\nthe changes of rock, or to show the markings on rocks claimed to have\r\nbeen caused by glacial abrasions. Icebergs can produce and explain\r\nevery such feature as is claimed for the glacier, and there seems to be\r\nlittle reason to doubt that similar evidences such as are imputed to\r\nglaciers are constantly going on as much at the present day as in any\r\nremote age in the past.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that icebergs have existed in all time from the\r\nearliest movement of the Earth’s machinery.\r\n\r\nAs explained in treating of icebergs, an area of extent equal to some\r\nof our smaller States frozen to a depth of thousands of feet breaks up\r\nand floats away from the polar oceans. Presuming an iceberg large as\r\nthe State of Rhode Island to start off, which is very likely a small\r\nestimate of the size of many, such berg being exposed to thawing winds\r\nand the sun’s rays until thousands of miles away from its starting\r\npoint, and after all these exposures is often a mass of 300 or more\r\nfeet high and 2,000 feet deep. Imagine the weight and force of such a\r\nbody striking the peak of some submarine mountain, the top of a hill\r\nwith the momentum produced by wind and tide. There tops could as easily\r\nbe wiped off and carried long distances, as a man can strike off the\r\ntop of a measure of grain, and leave the same marks attributed to\r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\nThese great masses of rock and soil supposed to be transferred from\r\ntheir original deposit are carried long distances till melting has\r\nloosened a hold, and they are dropped to the bottom of the ocean and\r\nleft for the wonderment and surmise of the future as to how they got\r\nthere. This process of wiping off high points of submarine lands must\r\nbe going on just as much at the present time as ever in the past, and\r\nseems a very wise and cheap system of dredging instituted by Providence.\r\n\r\nWith the reasoning to follow of how the Earth obtains and maintains its\r\nwarmth an ice age would seem an impossibility and absurdity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT PRODUCES A GLACIER?\r\n\r\nHere again the influence of Springs is called into service. As all\r\nthe hills and mountains, it is here claimed, are the results of water\r\naided by centrifugal force, therefore the hills and mountains become\r\nthe reservoirs of supply for all the lower parts of the Earth. This\r\narrangement of Nature provided the means for producing a Glacier. At\r\nhigh altitudes in the mountains, whether in the frigid zone or in the\r\ntemperate, break forth springs; coursing down the mountain side to the\r\nvalleys, the waters soon become aërated so as to freeze. Springs from\r\ndifferent ranges and neighboring heights contribute their streams,\r\nall commingling in the deep cañons and freezing in a mass. With the\r\naccumulations of snow and rain, this body grows until in time, by the\r\nconstant supply from the springs, rain and snow, the mountain gorges\r\nare filled however wide and large they may be.\r\n\r\nThis monstrous aggregation of ice must of course seek a lower point by\r\nits enormous weight and constant accumulation on top, and naturally\r\nbegins to crawl down the valley grade. The first inception of a glacier\r\nis spring water, which with other contributions named ultimately\r\nproduces what may be called a river of ice.\r\n\r\nUnder the ice river is always flowing a stream of water, and many air\r\nholes and openings are found upon the surface at different points,\r\nno doubt produced by the influence of spring water coming in of\r\ntemperature above freezing or at the usual fifty-two degrees, about the\r\naverage of fresh water springs in all latitudes. This conglomeration\r\nof influences to make a glacier shows the absurdity of having such\r\nsolid masses break off, as claimed to be seen by Arctic explorers,\r\nlarge enough to remain intact well down into the Atlantic Ocean. As\r\nthese mountain ravines fill up, of course the waters involve and\r\ncover with ice, every rock and tree, and all such objects in the way\r\nmust necessarily be carried to some lower point and ultimately left.\r\nThis faculty of a glacier has given it credit for performing all such\r\napparent transitions, while icebergs which evidently do 1,000 times\r\nthis amount of work are getting much the smaller share of credit.\r\n\r\nIt has been reported by sailors in the region of icebergs that by\r\nobservations taken during a few months, they perceptibly grow many\r\nfeet higher, which goes to prove the claim that they are constantly\r\nbeing added to from underneath. With change of season, these monsters\r\nare floated away from their moorings, toward the Equator to cool and\r\nfreshen the main oceans, produce electric currents of air, become the\r\nwonder and terror of ocean travel, and melting away under tropical\r\nsuns; or on the other hand, some may seek the interior and contribute\r\nthemselves to the cooling of the waters that manifest themselves in\r\nrefreshing springs all over the Earth.\r\n\r\nThere were newspaper reports of large masses of ice being thrown out\r\nduring the great eruption in the Island of Java, but such statements\r\nmay do better for newspaper items than to sustain an argument in\r\nthis work. How can this equable condition of spring water, with its\r\ndelicious coolness adjusted to all seasons and tastes, be accounted\r\nfor if it does not come practically from one common source? Will some\r\nscientist answer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nCAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese peculiar freaks in the Earth are nothing to excite much curiosity\r\nor wonder. It is rare to find caves only in limestone formations which\r\nby long contact with water gradually wash away and leave monstrous\r\nchambers that have formerly been a solid mass.\r\n\r\nSometimes a cave may be formed by a sinking of the floor, leaving the\r\narched top supporting itself, but whatever the cause and wherever caves\r\nare found, I never read of any but lead to subterranean rivers of\r\ngreat purity and coolness of water, nearly all the waters of which are\r\ncredited with blind fish. Where did the fish originate? The stalagmites\r\nand stalactites tell of the copious influence of water.\r\n\r\nWhat is the source of these cave rivers? Are they from soakage of\r\nrainfalls and do they have any dry season?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nARTESIAN WELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a subject that is worthy the attention of settlers in our arid\r\nand apparently desert regions of country. We are told that the source\r\nof an artesian well is from fountains of water gathered and stored in\r\nhigher lands that run through different strata of rocks till they reach\r\nthe valleys, and when the boring reaches down to these strata the water\r\nnaturally comes up toward the height of the fountain it started from.\r\nWould it not be a sensible inquiry to make as to where the supply came\r\nfrom to furnish the water in the higher lands? That the accepted theory\r\nof supply to artesian wells comes from some higher point is not correct\r\ncan be demonstrated on the prairies, where no higher land is in sight.\r\n\r\nA very good test occurred some years ago at the Hamilton mine,\r\nadjoining the great Chapin mine, in Wisconsin. It became almost\r\nimpossible to work the mine on account of the great influx of water.\r\n\r\nNot much more than a half mile away was a lake that was charged with\r\nproducing this annoying flow.\r\n\r\nAt the time of a temporary abandonment, the writer disputed this\r\nsolution, and a survey was proposed to determine the level in the lake\r\nand mine, which showed the water in the mine eleven feet the lowest. To\r\novercome this encroachment of water, an ingenious device was adopted\r\nby building a chimney over the point of inflow to the height of water\r\nlevel and stopping at the bottom; when completed allowed to fill.\r\n\r\nWhen its true level was reached the rest of the mine was dry some\r\ndistance above. It is doubtful if any place on the Earth will not\r\nrespond with a flow of water within a mile in depth and rarely half\r\nthat distance will need to be bored.\r\n\r\nIn the Mojave desert it is claimed a depth of 200 feet and often less\r\ngets a good flow of water. What sends it up and whence its source? In\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, and many other adjacent States, a depth of 100 or\r\n200 feet will produce large flowing wells. Where does this universal\r\nsupply come from and why unchanged by wet or dry seasons? The flow from\r\nLake Superior is frequently larger in the dry season of August than in\r\nthe wet season of spring.\r\n\r\nIf there is no unfailing supply of water in the Earth, where does the\r\ninfluence come from to produce an Oasis in a desert?\r\n\r\nIf artesian wells are bored in our arid and now almost worthless lands,\r\nwherever a fountain of water is tapped will be an Oasis around which\r\nthe settler can produce fabulous wealth of crops and obtain forage for\r\nlive stock. The expense of boring wells will be largely compensated by\r\ncheapness of land and bountiful results in vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nOASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese green spots in the great deserts are the counterparts of Islands\r\nin the oceans.\r\n\r\nIf not thrown up and fed by water upheaval, how are they produced?\r\nAre they volcanic? The Oasis of Ammonium, or Siwah, six miles long\r\nand eight wide, contains the ruins of the famous temple and oracle of\r\nAmmon, visited by Alexander the Great, and celebrated for the fountain\r\nof the Sun, whose waters are warm at morning and evening, and cold at\r\nnoon.\r\n\r\nThere are several oases not long distances west of the Nile in the\r\nGreat Desert. The ancients considered them as Islands in a Sea of Sand,\r\nbut they are really elevated lakes, although not manifesting themselves\r\nmuch at the surface, but underlying so closely as to render the climate\r\ntoo unhealthy to live in during the summer and autumn, being of a\r\nswampy character, and yet very productive in winter and spring. Where\r\ndo these waters soak in to produce such spots in the deserts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nTHINGS THAT PUZZLE US.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is frequently a query how the distribution of fish is so general\r\neven in the most obscure lakes and springs rising and running from\r\npoints so isolated as to apparently preclude such specimens from\r\ngetting there. It seems strange that some species would exist at the\r\nhead of a stream and not inhabit it throughout. Seas and lakes may,\r\nand do exist, without any visible outlets to the ocean, and yet are\r\nplentifully supplied with varieties of fish. Now what may be a rational\r\nexplanation of how they got there. It cannot seem right to say that\r\nthey originally existed in an adjacent sea or the nearest approach\r\nto the ocean, as they are not found in any adjacent waters and are\r\nentirely peculiar to their locality, having no neighbors akin. It\r\ndoes not seem as if such would be the case if they became isolated\r\nby some remote upheaval and change of surrounding Earth’s surface,\r\nas this would only divide up the family and spread the species like\r\nimmigration from the eastern to the western states.\r\n\r\nAs asked before, where do these blind fish come from in caves where\r\nstreams do not seem to have any connection with surface waters? Where\r\ndo the many specimens come from in the island lakes all over the world?\r\nTo all these questions there seems a simple answer when we accept the\r\nidea that the center of the Earth is the womb that is developing and\r\nsending out through every pore, seam, crevice and crack some new seed\r\nand form of life to develop a new and strange existence to us on the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nIt is a Scriptural idea that “We are born of water.”\r\n\r\nCreatures that have their inception in the bowels of the Earth cast\r\ntheir eggs as the fish and reptile spawn in our rivers. These eggs or\r\nspawn or seeds of life in whatever form are taken in the currents that\r\ncourse through the different strata of the earth by centrifugal force\r\nand pressure, taking almost any amount of time in their hermetically\r\nsealed transit before they reach an atmosphere in which to develop\r\ninto a new existence. Any lake, spring, or fountain of water that is\r\na living stream fed by the inexhaustible sources within, may have\r\nfrom that varied storehouse and laboratory of nature any specimen of\r\nfish, scale, skin, shell or reptile of any form, that no adjoining or\r\nneighboring water may develop.\r\n\r\nThe spawn or egg may be destroyed on its outward passage or held back\r\nby influences preventing its maturity; or landed on the surface under\r\nunfavorable conditions of climate, air, and properties in the water.\r\n\r\nWhy do shad not exist anywhere in similar coast waters? Where do they\r\ncome from and is the Gulf Stream to be credited with their origin?\r\nWhere do the different schools of blue fish, mackerel, herring and\r\nnumerous other fish find their headquarters to breed, and why after\r\nseeking other waters for a season, return to some place that seems to\r\nbe their “sweet home”?\r\n\r\nWas Seth Green the pioneer in transportation of spawn to distant waters\r\nfor their incubation? It is more than likely that he was not; with all\r\ncredit due to the great service his genius has rendered.\r\n\r\nWhat is said of the dissemination of fish, shells, and reptiles may be\r\nconsistently said of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe earth is filled with the seed of every plant and tree and shrub\r\nthat ever sprang into life in any place, clime or time. Dig to whatever\r\ndepth you will, the substance you throw out, whether earth or stone,\r\nwhen exposed to the air, will produce some growth of vegetation.\r\nFrequently something entirely new and different from the surrounding\r\nvegetation. To assume that streams, winds, and birds carry and\r\ndistribute all the seeds to their different localities where found in\r\nan isolated condition, is too much for human credulity. On the tops of\r\nmountains, where streams do not run uphill on the surface, where the\r\nbirds seldom fly, and on spaces impossible for seeds to be carried by\r\nwinds, you find species peculiar to their altitude, atmosphere and soil.\r\n\r\nThrough the channels that eternally pour from never ending supplies,\r\nand in which storehouse are mingled the seeds from every valley, plain\r\nand mountain top of our Earth; from this source they can be scattered\r\nand mixed in every inch of the soil which composes our Earth from\r\ncenter to surface, and when brought into contact with our atmosphere\r\nstart into new and varied existences.\r\n\r\nThe question may be reasonably asked if many of the reptilian specimens\r\nattributed to remote antiquity as belonging to our Earth’s surface,\r\nmay not be specimens from an interior world, and even now have\r\nrepresentatives of their existence there?\r\n\r\nCertain plants and growths require specific treatment and conditions.\r\nWherever pond lilies, peppermint, cattails, flag-root, cresses, and\r\nmoss in wells are found is unfailing proof of living fountains of water.\r\n\r\nThe ocean furnishes every facility of transportation through the\r\nco-operative system without and within. The millions of seed that\r\nmature in different climes on the surface are dropped and carried by\r\nfloods and currents into the main ocean. Some sink and lie buried\r\nfor ages, retaining their germs of life, for the outer ocean has its\r\nregular currents and motions to such an extent, it would not make a\r\ngeneral distribution of seed in countless years.\r\n\r\nThrough this avenue passing under the ice belt, every variety is more\r\nor less drawn into this general receptacle which, in turn carries them\r\ninward and outward, and in course of time filters them in their course\r\ninto every inch of the earth through which the water passes; which is\r\nin this way the medium of transportation.\r\n\r\nBy this means every spoonful of earth is in time prepared to give\r\ngrowth of new life to any plant or tree that has ever existed when\r\nexposed to the influence of air and heat or even cold, to revive its\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn passing to the surface, like the spawn of fish, they may pass\r\nthrough localities of such excessive heat as to destroy their life\r\ngerms, as is undoubtedly the case with the spawn that should travel\r\nthrough waters like geysers of Iceland or the Yellowstone Park or\r\nwaters similar to these, whose streams that flow away always show a\r\ndearth of fish.\r\n\r\nWith the Earth formed like this, the writer claims it to be on the\r\nprinciple of a globe for a gas jet, open on both sides and presenting\r\nas it turns inward a funnel shaped entrance, which is without doubt\r\nover 1,500 miles across; this passage would be just as vast to the eye\r\nas the size of, or distance to, the fixed stars, the eye losing all\r\nconception of measure, and a thousand miles is just as much beyond our\r\nscope of vision as a million.\r\n\r\nIn almost any position you can imagine the Earth to revolve around the\r\nSun, one of these sides or ends must be partially and at times wholly\r\nexposed to the Sun’s rays, and the effect, it seems natural to suppose,\r\nwould make the interior horizons light as the exterior. The water, it\r\nis believed, on any body acts as a reflector and is a giver of light\r\nfrom every planetary body in some degree.\r\n\r\nIt is all gas, to talk about the gaseous condition and nature of the\r\nSun, and “other worlds than ours.” They would at best be a very poor\r\ninvestment and not worth the labor and genius of a power able to\r\ncreate; 160 acres of good land in any productive locality would be\r\nworth more than 1,000 such whirling pyrotechnics of space.\r\n\r\nIt is altogether too presumptive to suppose that our little Earth\r\nwith all its boasted cities, and boroughs thrown in, can be the only\r\nhabitation for poor, vain and sinful man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nMETEORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are nothing more or less than dust particles thrown from volcanic\r\neruptions on some planet, and in countless numbers drifting through\r\ntime and space till sucked into the atmosphere of some other orb.\r\n\r\nWhoever doubts the influence of friction ought to be convinced by\r\nwatching these meteoric specks falling through our atmosphere of a\r\nclear evening, although the process goes on as much in day as night\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhile falling in space this dust must gain an inconceivable speed, as a\r\nfeather without resistance falls as rapidly as a ball of lead.\r\n\r\nThe contact with our atmosphere ignites and evidently consumes them\r\ninto gas before reaching the Earth. They used to be called falling\r\nstars, but if they were of inferior magnitude it is quite probable\r\nthere would have been many a badly bumped head before this time, from\r\nthe numbers that have fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a question not fully settled by sufficient authority.\r\nIt seems as if this term were incorrectly applied and that suction\r\nwould be a better name for the agency.\r\n\r\nThat bodies fall to the ground when dropped, or return when thrown or\r\nshot into the air is nothing more than a stick of wood thrown into a\r\nstream floats with the current and drifts to the bank.\r\n\r\nMost people when asked which side of a fan you feel the air from, when\r\nfanning yourself, naturally reply from the side toward you, but by\r\ntrying the experiment you will soon discover that the air comes after\r\nthe passage of the fan, only filling the space or vacuum the fan has\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asked why people trying to board a train in motion\r\nare so apt to be drawn under the wheels, and legs and arms crushed. It\r\nis the same reason as with the fan, a large vacuum is being produced\r\nand proportionate suction occurs to fill it.\r\n\r\nA man can stand alongside a train when motionless and lean against it,\r\nor put his hand on it, as safely as on the depot, but when in motion of\r\nthirty or forty miles an hour, it would be almost sure to cost him his\r\nlife. Attraction can hardly be possible except by affinity; iron can\r\nbe attracted by a magnet no more than wood, unless possessed of that\r\npeculiar quality of being magnetic. Mr. Edison’s experiments have to be\r\nconfined entirely to such bodies of ore.\r\n\r\nThat attraction of affinity exists there can be no doubt, as exhibited\r\nin plants, insects, birds and animals, both quadruped and biped,\r\notherwise courtship and marriage and all means of propagating species\r\nwould be for naught and neglected.\r\n\r\nIt is a general supposition that we derive our heat from the Sun\r\nby direct rays, but it is doubtful if it comes only through its\r\ninnumerable rays of light through which the Earth and the planets\r\nrevolve, and here friction puts in one of its special works. The common\r\nidea that noon-day is the time for the greatest heat is not always\r\njustified, for other influences, such as friction in the atmosphere,\r\ncan make midnight warmer than noon.\r\n\r\nThe concentrated rays of the Sun at midday of course bring them so\r\nclosely together, and direct, that the Earth’s revolution comes\r\nsquarely across them, as can be demonstrated across the teeth of a\r\ncomb, thus showing a greater pressure than drawn obliquely.\r\n\r\nThat heat can come directly from the Sun seems an impossibility without\r\nsome medium of contact, which through the coldness and a barrenness of\r\nspace does not seem to exist.\r\n\r\nAs we arrive at certain altitudes in the mountains, we find perpetual\r\nsnow and ice, and the same class of atmosphere is encountered anywhere\r\nelse rising in a balloon to similar heights. It would be natural to\r\nexpect an increasing warmth as we get away from the Earth toward the\r\nSun, but the reverse being the case, it is hard to imagine what the\r\ntemperature of space 1,000 miles away must be.\r\n\r\nThe question is likely to be asked, if the Sun does not send out heat,\r\nhow is it obtained?\r\n\r\nThe answer will be in accordance with the first proposition in this\r\nbrief work. All heat is obtained by Friction, in absence of which there\r\ncan be no heat. The Earth gets its heat mostly by friction through its\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe mass of atmosphere surrounding our planet is like an ocean made up\r\nof gases and elements that produce both water and land. The revolution\r\nof the Earth through that atmosphere at the rate of 1,000 miles an\r\nhour, seventeen miles a minute, or nearly four miles every second, is\r\nsomething as incomprehensible to our minds as the distance to the Sun.\r\nOnly for this friction for a certain distance from the surface, the\r\nsame condition of cold would no doubt exist on the surface as on the\r\ntops of the high ranges of mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Earth is producing its own warmth by friction in its atmosphere the\r\nsame as a wagon-wheel would do by being rapidly revolved inside of a\r\nloose tire. The atmosphere is virtually a tire surrounding us, through\r\nwhich the Earth revolves, and by Friction produces the warmth as really\r\nas a man warms his hands by rubbing them together.\r\n\r\nThat the Sun can be an inconsumable body of fire, or that it can become\r\nextinct is a most preposterous belief.\r\n\r\nThat the Sun is a vast body of earth and water hardly admits of a\r\ndoubt, and its warmth and light is due to the same influence largely\r\nthat the Earth and every other planet experiences.\r\n\r\nThere is not and cannot be a complete consumption of material in\r\nthe immutable affairs of Nature, as there must be an eternal and\r\nexhaustless interchange of supply and demand. While our forest and\r\nother fuel supply is being burned, another is growing and something\r\nforming to keep up the balance.\r\n\r\nIn Nature nothing is lost, neither can there be increase; design is\r\nlimitless, and resources inexhaustible; duplicates are never known in\r\nform, species, features, and thoughts; thus showing one of Nature’s\r\nmost positive laws, that mankind shall not accept one central thought,\r\ncreed, or purpose to be universally followed, as such an order of\r\nthings would entirely preclude the writing of the few hints herein\r\noffered, as the encouragement of any new device for man’s benefit of\r\nbody or mind, thus leaving everything in a state of stagnation wherein\r\nthrift, learning, and progress would be unknown.\r\n\r\nNature never repeats her works, and no two grains of sand or flakes of\r\nsnow have ever been exactly alike, or ever motionless. Motion causes\r\nfriction. Friction produces heat. Heat produces life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC THEORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean Sea, a body of water between Europe and Africa,\r\nnearly 2,000 miles in length, surrounded with most of the noted cities\r\nof antiquity, has remained during these thousands of years in an\r\nunchanged condition from tides, inundations, or any other disturbing\r\ncauses. Into this sea through the Strait of Gibraltar has been flowing\r\nall this time from the Atlantic Ocean, a river 15 miles wide with an\r\naverage depth of one and one-fourth miles. This river is reported to\r\nhave so strong a current that a sailing vessel has difficulty of coming\r\nout against it without the help of a favorable east wind. This is a\r\nsufficient flow of water to fill the basin of the sea almost yearly,\r\nbesides the help of all the rivers of Southern Europe and Northern\r\nAfrica. The reason of no change is given for its location, where\r\nevaporation carries off all this influx of water; while some think an\r\nundercurrent must exist back into the Atlantic. The first reason seems\r\ntoo ridiculous for a child to give. The water of the Atlantic is so\r\nsalt as to produce over a pound of salt to a common bucket full. If\r\nevaporation is the reason of its equable condition, there could be no\r\nother result than a mountain of salt big as the Himalayas long before\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nThe claim of a countercurrent is almost as absurd. That the sea\r\ndischarges its waters in an undercurrent which passes through the\r\nneighborhood of the Caspian and Aral Seas, is more likely than that the\r\nwaters run backward against a powerful current from the Atlantic and\r\nagainst the centrifugal force that governs the movements of relatively\r\nevery other water course on the Earth.\r\n\r\nSo much for that subject for any criticisms that may be offered.\r\nIntervening lakes between the Caspian and Aral Seas, seasonably fill\r\nwith salt water, from the evaporation of which immense bodies of salt\r\nare gathered. Where does this supply of salt water come from to leave\r\nhundreds of thousands of tons of salt each year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nSURFACE INFLUENCES OF WATER, AND CHANGE OF POLARITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery little thought or attention is paid to the insidious changes\r\nproduced by water on the Earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nNot a day passes, or has gone by, but that a large quantity of material\r\nis transferred from one locality to another. Every shower carries\r\nfrom some higher point to a lower, and a certain amount of drift goes\r\ntoward some ocean. Small streams contribute to the larger ones, and\r\nall lead to the great ocean reservoirs. In going across our country\r\nmany important evidences are to be seen of the immensity of work\r\naccomplished by water, in the removal of vast areas and depths of land.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable and apparent seen by the writer is in the\r\nvalley of the Rio Grande, in passing through New Mexico and at some\r\nother points. For more than 100 miles through this valley in the\r\nspring and summer you seem to be following an ordinary creek that gives\r\nlittle idea of the importance attached to such a stream as the Rio del\r\nNorte. You see a stream, only thirty or forty feet wide, with steep,\r\nabrupt banks, of a sort of adobe soil, some six to ten feet high.\r\n\r\nAt various places, if you observe, in the bends of the stream these\r\nperpendicular banks of earth will be caved off into the water, at\r\nfrequent intervals. When the next annual freshet comes this loosened\r\nearth is carried away toward the Gulf of Mexico, and portions of it\r\nreach there while other parts will be lodged at different points on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nNow this visible, and natural process, has been going on for ages, and\r\nthe effect of this incessant work and stupendous result is to be seen\r\nfar as the eye can reach for hundred of miles.\r\n\r\nHere follow the proofs of this long and diligent labor. In all\r\ndirections you see hills, or immense mounds of land, like inverted\r\ndeep pans, with flat bottoms, of all sizes, so that their flat tops\r\nwould include from one acre to hundreds. These mounds all have quite\r\nprecipitous sides, subject to the wash of every rainy season. As you\r\nstudy the character of these high mounds you will soon be convinced\r\nthey are not upheavals, as their tops in all directions seem to have\r\na common level. Among these mounds will be occasional ones that have\r\nbeen washed away to a point, and here and there one reduced to half\r\nits original height. These hill-tops, if they may be so called, were\r\nbeyond doubt, at some very remote time in the past, the common level of\r\nthe country for hundreds of miles, and as they will average 100 feet\r\nhigh or more, it is beyond the power of conjecture to estimate the time\r\nrequired to wash all the vast area away that once existed to make up\r\nthe level of this valley.\r\n\r\nAnother similar exhibition is at and near River Falls, in Wisconsin, a\r\ntown on the east bank of the Mississippi, some thirty miles east of St.\r\nPaul. Here the same occurrence seems to have taken place, of a washing\r\naway of the greatest bulk of the land, and leaving similar mounds with\r\ntheir flat tops, on many of which are quite extensive farms, approached\r\nby very precipitous roads at some favorable point on their sides. These\r\nmounds seem to have different strata of soft rock, on which they stand,\r\nthe lowest and thickest of gray sandstone, quite soft, and must, with\r\nthe others, be gradually wasting away by frosts, and other agencies to\r\ndisintegrate. Only one yellowish stratum is strong enough to be used\r\nfor some building purposes.\r\n\r\nWhile there are hundreds of these mounds that must have once been the\r\nlevel of the whole country, that which is now left is a very level and\r\nfertile soil, producing some of the finest wheat, and best quality of\r\npotatoes in the State.\r\n\r\nThese instances are only two out of thousands of a similar nature in\r\nthis country and all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of this drift is mostly as the streams of water run toward\r\nthe Equator or center of greatest motion.\r\n\r\nThe vast deserts and other accumulations of sand on the Earth are only\r\nthe deposits of ancient rivers into then existing seas, which by later\r\nsurface upheavals, by interior hydraulic forces, have been transferred\r\nto other beds, and the deserts like Sahara, Atacama, Mojave, and the\r\nSteppes of Asiatic Tartary, remain as evidences.\r\n\r\nBy these enormous changes of soil it seems rational to believe the\r\nuniform and unvarying revolution of the Earth could hardly be possible,\r\nand that more or less change during great length of years must be made\r\nin form as well as time of revolving. Have not both occurred? Riding\r\ndown the Quinnipiac Valley to New Haven, Conn., a man is likely to\r\ninquire in his mind where those sand plains came from. Some think the\r\nConnecticut once flowed there, some the Niagara or St. Lawrence; if\r\nso, where did they bring the sand from?\r\n\r\nThink of the change bound to come in the future, when the Falls of\r\nNiagara cut their way back to Lake Erie, thus letting out its waters,\r\nenough to construct it into a large river.\r\n\r\nSome channel has evidently been lowered to settle the surface of Lake\r\nMichigan, as can be plainly seen in leaving Chicago by boat, that the\r\nwaters on the western banks were once twenty or more feet above present\r\nlevel. Either the lake has settled or the land has risen. As deserts\r\nare nearly all below the ocean surface, is it not presumable that this\r\nenormous accumulation of sand has had the effect of such depression,\r\nwhile the transference from other localities has thinned Earth’s crust\r\nenough to make easy the internal water pressure to lift up the hills\r\nand mountains, through which the great water courses of the Earth are\r\nsupplied? Think of the transportation of soil to the deltas of the\r\nMississippi, Amazon, Ganges and other rivers amounting to millions and\r\nmillions of tons every year, and imagine when the time will come when\r\nthe Earth approaches the form of a wheel, or ring, nearer than a globe,\r\nand become a small imitation of Saturn.\r\n\r\nAssuming that this is, and has been one cause of the great upheavals,\r\nis it not suggestive that the original of the Earth’s surface in its\r\nformation millions of years past, was nearly or quite free from hills,\r\nand mountains, and the inside as well as exterior has been undergoing\r\nradical changes?\r\n\r\nGreat masses of earth on the outside accumulated by floods and washed\r\nfrom higher points have dammed up and smothered the flow from inside,\r\nwhile the sections of the Earth that have contributed to this mass\r\nhave been thrown up into exterior mountains, and the depressions made\r\ninheavals to a corresponding extent.\r\n\r\nFrom this reasoning it might appear why Africa and Australia, with\r\ntheir vast area of deserts, are less supplied with rivers and lakes\r\nproportionally to other continents; the same deficiency of mountains\r\nbeing noticeable. On the other hand, the rest of the continents and\r\nislands abound in mountains, lakes, springs and rivers. The great\r\npresent groups of Islands of Oceanica, will, perhaps, in the distant\r\nfuture, all be joined to one mass, and while they may rise higher,\r\nothers in present use may sink.\r\n\r\nThe legend of Atlantis may be repeated in some coming age, and perhaps\r\na new Bible story will record the seagoing experience of another Noah;\r\nbut if so, it is hoped he will have a bigger ship, and better provided\r\nwith modern improvements and other sanitary arrangements than the\r\nold boat seemed to be for so long and important a voyage. From what\r\nhas been written on surface influence of water is it not reasonable\r\nthat polar variations must have occurred through the millions of\r\nyears Mother Earth has been whirling through space? The writer does\r\nnot assume to know all claimed in this discussion, being an agnostic\r\nin this as well as in spiritual knowledge; but if some full-grown\r\nscientific giant will rise up and give any more plausible reasons for\r\nwhy things are as they are, I shall be delighted to sit on some little\r\nstool and let him thrust the information into my bewildered cranium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of this unscientific work has assumed the task to contradict\r\ntheories that to him have seemed wrong, although long accepted from\r\nscientific authorities.\r\n\r\nThe world is given to taking statements for granted that emanate from\r\nsome professional man’s brain, and published in some newspaper or book,\r\nwhether of real or fictitious origin.\r\n\r\nThe stories of Wm. Tell, Robinson Crusoe, Washington and his little\r\nhatchet, Jack the Giant Killer, Samson and the foxes, Joseph sold\r\ninto Egypt, St. Patrick’s extermination of toads and snakes, Newton’s\r\ndiscovering the “law of gravitation” by an apple dropping on his head,\r\nNoah’s flood, etc.--all of these and hundreds more have passed for\r\ncurrent facts by being oft told. Plain stories and simple unadorned\r\ntales have small circulation without lies enough mixed in to make them\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nEvery age has its learned prodigies and scientific minds that are\r\nready to answer any question and solve all obscure matters. When men of\r\nearly ages discovered on hills and mountains marine shells and other\r\ndeposits which showed evidence of the bottom of a sea or ocean, and\r\nfossil deposits and footprints in rocks, they naturally inquired of the\r\nwise men how they came there. Hence quite likely the story of the flood.\r\n\r\nWhen they asked how the people of Europe were white, Asia, yellow,\r\nand Africa, black, the solution was, that Noah had three sons who\r\nsettled, one in each country and produced such progeny. The geography\r\nof the world in those early times represented the Earth as having four\r\ncorners, and surface flat with “jumping off” places on all sides. It is\r\nevident the solvers of this “race problem” had no knowledge of America\r\nand Australasia. (Time has developed the fact that they either knew\r\nabout it and lied, or lost sight of two sons that Noah should have had\r\nto represent the red and brown races.) It is expected of us to believe\r\nthat Japheth was white, and peopled Europe; Shem yellow, and settled\r\ndown to farming in Asia, and Ham black, and went into the monkey and\r\nelephant business in Africa. Whether the two other boys, the brown one,\r\nthat raised Malays, and the red one, that bred and introduced the\r\nAmerican Indian, were ever married, I never learned, but conclude it\r\nwas unnecessary, as they seemed to have as good success in settling up\r\ntheir respective countries as the favorite boys that Noah took, with\r\nother live stock, on his yachting trip.\r\n\r\nNoah should have really been the man to write on the subject about\r\nwhich this paper treats, as his experience on the “cold-water” question\r\nmust have given him superior advantages over the writer.\r\n\r\nThere have been conscientious men of all times who have said and done\r\nvery silly and unwise things, which, at the time and in the age they\r\nwere enacted, were considered by public and private consent right and\r\njust.\r\n\r\nThe hanging of witches, buying and selling of slaves, the burning of\r\nJohn Rogers at the stake, his wife and nine small children, one at the\r\nbreast, as spectators, were considered as just and necessary as an act\r\nput in force to destroy crows and kill sheep dogs.\r\n\r\nAs age succeeds age, new ideas crop out, and what to a former\r\ngeneration appeared true and consistent to their successors oft\r\nbecome a subject of criticism and ridicule. It is to be hoped that\r\nfuture minds will take up the subject of this crude work and make as\r\nmuch advance in the development of Earth’s mysteries as the modern\r\nsteamship excels in completeness and power the first attempts of\r\nFulton, or the harmonious modern orchestras the hollow music of a\r\nHindoo tom-tom.\r\n\r\nTo believe what is here written will not insure eternal joys, or to\r\ndoubt will not incur Divine wrath, or commit a skeptic into the hands\r\nof him who walketh in darkness, or to an eternity of pain or woe.\r\n\r\nThese modest hints are given with the hope that millions of miles of\r\nland on Earth now barren and useless, by tapping the generous fountains\r\nof water so wisely stored by Providence, may be turned into gardens\r\nof beauty, and furnish fruits and sustenance in plenty for coming\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nWhile many look upon the Earth as “a vale of tears,” it is the best\r\nworld we have any reliable knowledge of, and seems well adapted to the\r\nwants of animal and vegetable life, if we avail ourselves of the wise\r\nand ample provisions Nature has put in our way.\r\n\r\nIf there is another and better world to come, it is hard to imagine\r\nthat pearly gates and golden streets can conduce as much to our\r\ncomfort, or will be as goodly a heritage as one of “sweet fields\r\narrayed in living green,” with shady groves, blooming gardens, and\r\ngenerous fountains of pure sparkling waters, and not the thirsty abode\r\nexperienced by Dives.\r\n\r\nWhile on this Earth, Nature has supplied with prodigality for this\r\nlife’s wants, land and water, light and darkness, floods and drouth,\r\nand, as learned from Paul, four kinds of flesh (and he didn’t say how\r\nmany kinds of vegetables) reptiles, insects, worms, bugs, microbes,\r\npoison and its antidotes, good people and bad, heat and cold, salt and\r\nfresh water, scientists, cranks and fools, yet with all this profusion\r\nof gifts, we would be no better off than Dives in Sheol without the\r\nindispensable blessing of water supplied by Symmes’s Hole.\r\n\r\nA few more questions and done. Why should sea soundings five miles deep\r\nbe at temperatures below freezing, if, as is claimed, such a depth in\r\nland borings would be in a molten condition, and going much farther the\r\nprevailing theory would make hell an ice house in comparison with the\r\nLaurentian strata?\r\n\r\nWhere does the fresh water come from admitted to exist in the bottom of\r\nthe oceans?\r\n\r\nWhere is the source of fresh water that abounds in the highlands of\r\nislands in all latitudes?\r\n\r\nWhere does the water come from that feeds all the coral reefs and\r\nthrows up atolls hundreds of miles in extent and nourishes the roots of\r\ntrees and smaller vegetation?\r\n\r\nWhy are the atoll inclosures filled with different varieties of fish\r\nfrom the ocean outside?\r\n\r\nWhy are most of the great lakes at high elevations and commonly on top\r\nof divides?\r\n\r\nWhy are springs more numerous all over the Earth on the hills and\r\nmountains than in the valleys?\r\n\r\nWhy are the shallowest and most enduring wells on the highlands instead\r\nof the low?\r\n\r\nWhy when a country is below sea level is it a desert?\r\n\r\nWhy did Abraham succeed with his flocks, while Lot (as he deserved) was\r\ndried up and burnt out? Answer, Abraham was the smarter of the two, and\r\ntook to the hills, where he no doubt had observed the waters lasted.\r\n\r\nWhere did Moses look for water when his followers were famishing for\r\nit? He went where water can almost invariably be found, at the foot of\r\na rocky upheaval which he discovered in Horeb.\r\n\r\nHow could water be cast up from a deep artesian well, bored on a plain\r\nwith no high land in sight to produce a pressure claimed in explaining\r\ntheir nature and reasons why they flow?\r\n\r\nWhere do all the rivers found in large caves have their origin?\r\n\r\nWhere and how does rain water soak into the ground, turn around and\r\ncome back again with the force shown in bubbling springs and artesian\r\nwells?\r\n\r\nWhy does moss only grow in unfailing wells, and cresses, peppermint,\r\ncattails, and water lilies in living waters?\r\n\r\nWhy in digging wells anywhere in striking gravel do they always find\r\nwater?\r\n\r\nWhy do hills and mountains produce more verdure and forests than the\r\nplains?\r\n\r\nWhy are all the volcanoes extinguished by water?\r\n\r\nThese questions can none of them be answered by any other hypothesis\r\nthan through a belief in the existence of Symmes’s Hole. Into such a\r\nhole sufficient water could flow to supply all the fountains of the\r\nEarth, and, what is more, it does flow, and furnishes the wonderful\r\nquantities that leap down the mountain sides in stupendous waterfalls,\r\nthat feed the millions of springs that pour their sweet influences in\r\nrippling streams through valleys and meadows. It supplies the great\r\nvolumes that make Lake Superior and its grand associates in America,\r\nand similar great lakes throughout the Earth. Last, but far from\r\nleast, the phenomenal Gulf Stream that floats the navies and commerce\r\nof the world like toys and modifies the climate across an ocean. To\r\nsupply such resources needs something more than occasional showers\r\nthat ordinarily evaporate in forty-eight hours, or than equinoctial or\r\nshearing sheep storms, of which nine-tenths of their volume runs into\r\nthe streams and rapidly to the ocean, the great and general reservoir\r\nof supply and distribution.\r\n\r\nHaving endeavored to explain the philosophy of heat and its cause, also\r\nother phenomena in brief, I will conclude by paying tribute to the\r\ngreat exterior waters, for their important participation in Nature’s\r\nmunificent work. The Oceans, after tossing in the fury of the storms\r\nand rocking from continent to continent, kissed by tropical winds and\r\nfrozen by Arctic cold, sunk in caverns, and dashed upon high rocks,\r\nafter drinking up all the rivers, washing every shore, and visiting\r\nevery clime, are filtered at the Ice Belt and enter the bowels of the\r\nEarth, to come out again by centrifugal force in a fresh and renewed\r\nform to contribute to man’s necessities in an even greater benefit than\r\nwhen rolling in majestic waves or floating the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the size of icebergs, fields of ice and glaciers.\r\n\r\nOcean depths, different estimates of.\r\n\r\nThe character of volcanic eruptions respecting material thrown out and\r\nfinal result of filling with water.\r\n\r\nFor evidences of how long heat will remain when covered after great\r\nfires, the same as in old times when people covered the backlog, and to\r\nshow the reason for judging the interior to be molten when the heat is\r\ndeveloped at insignificant depths by friction leading it to a further\r\nvolcanic development, or else from an extinct volcano from long time\r\npast.\r\n\r\nArtesian Waters, Caverns, Earthquakes, Gulf Streams, Lakes, Springs,\r\nWells, Islands, etc.\r\n\r\nThis appendix is added showing cases something in harmony with the\r\narguments here presented on all these subjects, to which could be added\r\nseveral times as many more.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the points intended for a brief discussion in this book\r\nhave been hit upon, a few words, with some newspaper clippings on\r\nmysterious things, are thought best to be added as a sort of appendix,\r\nand of such a character as to prove of benefit to some readers that see\r\nfit to avail themselves of a few hints to obtain water, for domestic\r\nor irrigating purposes, in an easy way, and where they would naturally\r\nleast expect to find it.\r\n\r\nAt my old home, on the farm where I was born, our well, some thirty\r\nfeet deep, nearly every season went dry. I have lugged hundreds of\r\npails of water from neighbors’ wells and from a spring near the foot of\r\nthe hill, one-third of a mile away, during my early life.\r\n\r\nThe hill is little over a half mile long, and less than one-fourth a\r\nmile wide from its furthest bases. It is shaped like a box turtle,\r\nrising 100 feet or more. There used to be a place near the top, on the\r\neast slope, that looked springy. The recent owner, a few years ago, dug\r\ninto this wet spot, and at a few feet found living water, which is now\r\npiped to his house and barns in plenty.\r\n\r\nSome years ago my cousin owned the adjoining farm on the north end of\r\nthis hill, and employed a man to blast out several large iron rocks,\r\nscattered about on the surface of the hill. One of these rocks, nearly\r\na rod square, lay almost exactly on the highest part of the hill.\r\nThis big rock was full of large cracks, which, in my boyhood, I took a\r\nyoung visitor to see, explaining to him that these cracks, no doubt,\r\noccurred at the time of the crucifixion, of which pious information I\r\nwas frequently reminded in later life. This rock was some eight feet\r\ndeep in the ground. When the last blocks were hauled out the space\r\npartly filled with clear water, so cold that it was made available for\r\ndrinking. Being in the dryest time of the year, the supply appeared to\r\nbe permanent, which induced the laying of pipes one-third of a mile to\r\nbarns for watering stock, which before had to be drawn mostly from the\r\nwells.\r\n\r\nA man in the town of Durham--Henry Page--for years obtained water\r\nfor his house and stock by a hydraulic ram; but, getting a new idea,\r\ntook advantage of a knoll, shaped like an inverted bowl, an acre or\r\ntwo in extent, lying across a field some forty rods from his house.\r\nHe dug into the top of this knoll some fifteen feet, striking plenty\r\nof water, which was easily piped all over his premises in abundant\r\nsupply. West of his home rose the Besek Mountain, in a gradual rise for\r\nthree-fourths of a mile, where it stopped in precipitous ledges, on the\r\nwest side, nearly 200 feet high. I have hunted up to the top of these\r\nledges. Near the top of the mountain is quite a section of swamp, and\r\nnearby descending is a spring that runs a short distance, falling over\r\na shelving rock, and in two or three rods more is lost in the loose\r\nstones. It is there in the dryest seasons. Similar to this is a lake\r\non Talcott Mountain, a short distance from Wadsworth Tower, and only\r\na few rods from the abrupt ledges that overlook the towns of Simsbury\r\nand Farmington. Hundreds of such cases are in evidence all over the\r\ncountry, and it is quite sure that a large majority of those interested\r\nby reading this book will think of various similar cases that have been\r\na query in their minds, “Why they were so.”\r\n\r\nWhile a great number of peculiar features of this kind can be recorded,\r\nI will take time to relate a case or two farther from home.\r\n\r\nMy cousin, who took the Scripture lesson of the rock and its rendings,\r\nspent his last days in Southern California, where springs are rare, and\r\norange groves and vineyards depend greatly upon irrigating for water.\r\nHe was located at Duarte, about twenty miles east of the city of Los\r\nAngeles, in one of the finest orange and lemon groves in the State.\r\nWhile they had provisions for irrigating, the lack of drinking water\r\nwas seriously felt.\r\n\r\nVisiting at my house some twenty years ago, where he chiefly made his\r\nEastern home, he listened to my cranky ideas as set forth in this work.\r\nAt first he scoffed, but being a good reasoner, he afterward thought\r\nthe idea worth trying, and promised on his return to experiment and\r\nreport, as I had convinced him of several successes here. In less than\r\na month I got word from him that “he had struck it.” The grove lay at\r\nthe foot of the San Gabriel Mountain, not one-quarter of a mile away.\r\nI advised him to select some place in the side of the mountain where\r\nthe tree growth was greenest, which he did, and got all the pure water\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Fitzgerald, owning a large grove about a mile west, similarly\r\nlocated, took the hint and obtained quite a favorable result. When\r\nvisiting these groves in 1894, almost the first thing Mr. Fitzgerald\r\nwanted to show me was his bountiful supply of spring water, tapped\r\nfrom the side of the mountain. These hints and cases are related as\r\nsuggestions to any reader who may wish to better his water supply.\r\nDon’t go into the low ground for it, but tap the hills and high lands,\r\nwhere all the fountains of the earth are in abundance.\r\n\r\nIn Southern California three seasons out of four the plains and valley\r\nlands become too dry for pasturage of cattle and horses and bands of\r\nsheep, and a general hegira is made toward the mountains. While the\r\nWinter rains swell the streams running to the coast, filling their\r\nbanks with rushing waters, by May and June a buggy can be hauled\r\nthrough every stream from San Francisco to San Diego without wetting\r\nthe hubs of the wheels. The small streams are all dried up, and water\r\nfor stock rare to find. As you go toward the mountains you meet the\r\nseries of foothills like inverted bowls, the tops of which show growth\r\nof bulrushes and fleur de lis. At the foot of the hills will be found\r\nsome of the drippings from the streams starting farther back. As these\r\nhills rise in groups, higher and higher toward the mountains, the\r\ngreen tops show more and more, and the streams increase in volume,\r\naffording good fishing for trout. Standing on the tops of these sugar\r\nloaf formations in the grazing season, one is reminded of Abraham’s\r\nherds of cattle on a thousand hills, to be seen as far as the eye can\r\nreach. In southern Minnesota is a long range of highlands thrown up,\r\nwhich they term a mountain chain, but scarcely anywhere is there an\r\nupheaval of rocks or any ledges. Over this range every Spring and Fall\r\nseason will be seen thousands of flocks of ducks, brant, wild geese\r\nand sand hill cranes. The springs do not gush out in streams as from\r\nrocky formations, but ooze up into great mounds, frequently involving\r\nan acre or more, like a great conical sponge, up the side of which\r\nyou can walk, the water gushing out under every footstep, giving an\r\nimpression that you may sink in all the way to the top, where you will\r\nfind an open spring several feet across, the water from which seems to\r\nbe absorbed by this spongy mound of earth and vegetation, so that a\r\nstream rarely runs away. This ridge being the highest land in sight,\r\nwhere does this water come from? In a country surrounding which, it is\r\nnecessary to carry water in kegs for the dogs to drink when hunting\r\nover it.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this work will be made up of a variety of clippings\r\nfrom newspapers for several years past, of which these are a small\r\npart. These clippings are published as seeming mysteries, but which,\r\nby the adoption of the theory promulgated of a hollow earth holding an\r\nocean of fresh waters, seem easy of solution. If any other method can\r\nbe suggested to answer these puzzling questions, it is to be hoped some\r\ngenius will reveal it. If the assertions made in this book are true,\r\npolar expeditions are and will continue to be as futile as an attempt\r\nto signal the inhabitants of Mars, or to get up a correspondence with\r\nthe man in the moon. Not presuming to exhaust this subject in so brief\r\na treatise, the field is left open, and large enough for the thoughts\r\nand observations of men of greater ability to discuss than yours truly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMENSE FIELDS OF ICE.\r\n\r\nA STEAMER SURROUNDED AND COMPELLED TO WORK HER WAY OUT.\r\n\r\nMONTREAL, May 22.--The steamer Fremona, from New Castle, which arrived\r\nhere yesterday, had a very startling experience with the ice about 150\r\nmiles on the other side of Cape Ray. The vessel was steaming slowly\r\nthrough a dense fog on Wednesday last, when she got right in the midst\r\nof a pack of ice, which was drifting southward with the Arctic current.\r\nAfter the steamer had been pounding about in the ice for some hours the\r\nfog lifted and showed the vessel to be in a dangerous position. All\r\naround her were heavy hummocks of ice, ten feet deep in the water and\r\nshowing about a foot above the surface. Gradually nearing the steamer\r\nand crushing the smaller pieces of ice in their way were a number of\r\nhuge icebergs. The captain and chief officer climbed to the masthead\r\nand found that the ice extended on all sides as far as the eye could\r\nsee. There were hundreds of seals on the ice, some of them being close\r\nto the vessel. Two hours were spent in turning the steamer, and she\r\nwas then headed southward and was worked out of the ice. Owing to\r\nthe movement of such a large mass of ice southward it is feared that\r\nnavigation will be seriously interfered with.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNews from the whalers in the Antarctic Seas on February 17 was that\r\nup to that time the whaling had proved a failure, with all the ships\r\nthat made the venture. There were plenty of whales of the finner and\r\nhumpback kind, but none of the Greenland kind. Grampuses were too\r\nplentiful. Seals were very numerous, and there were also plenty of sea\r\nlions. Some icebergs of enormous size were seen; one was fifty miles\r\nlong and several were from fifteen to twenty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Antarctic Ocean the icebergs that have been noticed from time to\r\ntime rose 400, 580, 700 and even 1,000 feet above the water, and were\r\nfrom three to five miles long. Their enormous bulk may be inferred from\r\nthe fact that the part under water is about seven times as large as\r\nthat above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSED A GREAT ICEBERG.\r\n\r\nLONDON, Dec. 9.--The British steamship Galgate reports ice in the South\r\nAtlantic. On September 28, in latitude 49 degrees south, longitude 42\r\ndegrees west, the Galgate passed an iceberg two miles long and 250 feet\r\nhigh. Hundreds of other icebergs were also seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE HUNDRED MILES OF ICE.\r\n\r\nST. JOHN’S, N. F., Feb. 12.--The British steamer Dahome, which left\r\nHalifax on the 9th for this port and Liverpool, arrived here to-day.\r\nShe reports coming through a field of ice three hundred miles long.\r\nThis is something unprecedented at this season.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREATEST OCEAN DEPTH.\r\n\r\nThe greatest known depth of the ocean is midway between the Island of\r\nTristan d’Acunha and the mouth of the Rio de la Plata. The bottom was\r\nthere reached at a depth of 40,236 feet, or eight and three-quarter\r\nmiles, exceeding by more than 17,000 feet the height of Mount Everest,\r\nthe loftiest mountain in the world. In the North Atlantic Ocean, south\r\nof Newfoundland, soundings have been made to a depth of 4,580 fathoms,\r\nor 37,480 feet, while depths equaling 34,000 feet, or six and a half\r\nmiles, are reported south of the Bermuda Islands. The average depth of\r\nthe Pacific Ocean between Japan and California is a little over 2,000\r\nfathoms; between Chili and the Sandwich Islands, 2,500 fathoms; and\r\nbetween Chili and New Zealand, 1,500 fathoms. The average depth of all\r\nthe oceans is from 2,000 to 2,500 fathoms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRussian reports say that the Sea of Aral has been steadily rising since\r\n1891. The sea level is now four feet above that of 1874. The line of\r\nrailroad from Orenburg to Tashkend had to be changed in order to avoid\r\nbeing overflowed. Instead of sinking three inches a year, as German\r\ngeographers had computed, the sea has been rising at the rate of four\r\ninches a year for the last ten years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1812 it was La Souffrière, adjacent to the Morne Garou, which broke\r\nloose on the Island of St. Vincent, and it is the same Souffrière\r\nwhich now has devastated the island and is bombarding Kingston with\r\nrocks, lava and ashes.\r\n\r\nThe old crater of Morne Garou has long been extinct, and, like the old\r\ncrater of Mont Pelee, near St. Pierre, it had far down in its depths,\r\nsurrounded by sheer cliffs from 500 to 800 feet high, a lake.\r\n\r\nGlimpses of the lake of Morne Garou were difficult to get, owing to the\r\nthick verdure growing about the dangerous edges of the precipices, but\r\nthose who have seen it describe it as a beautiful sheet of deep blue\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN’S TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nF. R. (Minneapolis, Minn.): Has the temperature of the sun been\r\nestablished? And, if so, what is it?\r\n\r\nThe following figures are given by the principal scientists who studied\r\nthe solar temperature: Newton, 1,669,000 degrees Alsius; Pouillet,\r\n1,461; Zollner, 102,000; Secchi, 5,344,840; Ericson, 2,726,700; Fizeau,\r\n7,500; Walerston, 9,000,000; Abney and Fessing, 12,700; Wilson and\r\nGray, 8,700; Pernter, 30,000; Sporer, 27,000; Sainte-Claire Deville,\r\n2,500; Soret, 5,801,846; Vicair, 1,398; Violle, 1,500; Rosetti,\r\n20,000; Langley, 8,333,000; Ebert, 40,000; Guillaume and Christiansen,\r\n6,000; Paschen, 5,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAW TREMENDOUS ICEBERGS.\r\n\r\nTHEY ARE 300 FEET HIGH AND SEVEN AND EIGHT MILES LONG NEAR CAPE HORN.\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20.--French sailing vessels making port from around\r\nCape Horn hold the record for sighting huge icebergs. The French bark\r\nEugenie Fautrel, from Hamburg, reported that on September 14, near Cape\r\nHorn, a berg seven miles long and 300 feet high was seen several miles\r\ndistant on the port bow. Now comes the French bark Anne De Bretagne,\r\n164 days from Cardiff, and reports that she not only saw a berg 300\r\nfeet high and eight miles long, but she had to sheer off to keep from\r\nwrecking herself against it.\r\n\r\nIt was seen on September 3, and after passing through a great mass of\r\nice, the Bretagne suddenly came within sight of the giant, harmless\r\nenough in appearance through the soft mist, but with terribly jagged\r\ncomers, and a breadth of front that made the Frenchmen quail.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINGSTOWN COVERED WITH ASHES.\r\n\r\nIt was seen then that the volcano was in constant eruption, and there\r\nwas a tremendous roar. Forked lightning played incessantly over the\r\ndisturbed section. The flashes averaged from sixty to one hundred a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nKingstown, which is twelve miles from the volcano, was covered with\r\nthree inches of ashes and showers of stones on Thursday. The bed of the\r\nold volcano was then a lake three miles across.\r\n\r\nERUPTION STARTED ON MONDAY.\r\n\r\nThe eruption was first observed on Monday. Huge flames of water shot\r\nup, and the people in that district fled. There has been a continuous\r\nroar ever since.\r\n\r\nThe northern district, from Chateau Belair to Georgetown, has been\r\ncompletely destroyed. It is impossible to proceed beyond that point,\r\non account of the rivers of lava. A huge hill was observed where\r\npreviously there had been a valley. The whole of that part of the\r\nisland is smoking.\r\n\r\nSIXTY KILLED BY LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nSixty persons are reported to have been killed by lightning while\r\ngetting away.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday the island was showered with ashes. Near\r\nBelair the ashes were three feet deep.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday there was a continuous shower of hot sand and water.\r\nEverything on the island was ruined by the ashes.\r\n\r\nSOME PERSONS DYING OF THIRST.\r\n\r\nMany persons were brought in boats from Kingstown. Some of the refugees\r\nwho arrived on the coast were dying of thirst.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW JACKSONVILLE.\r\n\r\nA FRESH CITY BUILT BEFORE THE RUINS OF THE OLD HAVE CEASED TO SMOULDER.\r\n\r\nBefore the fire that destroyed a great part of the city of\r\nJacksonville, Fla., had ceased to burn, the city has practically\r\nbeen rebuilt. This statement not only describes a building operation\r\nremarkable for rapid execution, but also covers an incident unique in\r\nthe experience of firemen.\r\n\r\nJacksonville was almost wiped out by fire on May 3 of last year. An\r\narea of 443 acres, comprising 148 blocks, was swept by the flames, and\r\nproperty worth at least $15,000,000 was destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe work of rebuilding on a better and more substantial scale was\r\nstarted within a week and has since gone on with rapidity unprecedented\r\nin Southern building operations, and now the city is in far better\r\nshape than it was before the fire.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks ago the clearing up of the last of the ruins was\r\nbegun. The laborers doing the work removed three or four inches of the\r\nmass of brick and stones on top, and then found, to their surprise,\r\nthat underneath the ruins were still hot.\r\n\r\nSmoke began to rise out of the hole they had dug out, and the farther\r\ndown they went the hotter became the ruins, and the thicker the smoke.\r\nAt last a mass of red hot coals was found, which sprang into flame when\r\nthe air reached it.\r\n\r\nIt had been necessary several times within the year for the fire\r\ndepartment to soak this part of the ruins with water, but it had been\r\nthought for several months that the fire must be out at last.\r\n\r\nAlongside new Jacksonville had already sprung into existence. Six\r\nmonths after the destruction of the city a new one already covered the\r\ngreater part of the site.\r\n\r\nWithin eleven months more than 2,000 buildings were erected, fifty\r\nof them aggregating in cost $2,000,000. And the new Jacksonville is\r\nimmeasurably superior to the old.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRAIRIE CAVERN.\r\n\r\nAN INTERESTING HOLE IN THE GROUND WHERE CAVES WOULD NOT BE LOOKED FOR.\r\n\r\n_From the Oklahoma State Capital._\r\n\r\nSULPHUR SPRINGS, I. T., Oct. 18.--At a spot eleven miles southeast of\r\nthis place, in the level prairie upland, is an opening about forty\r\nfeet in diameter and sixty feet in depth. By clinging to its rocky and\r\nprecipitous walls, a person may descend to the bottom, and there find\r\nthe openings to the two caves, one leading westward, and the other two\r\nto the east. For years this place has been known as Rock Prairie Cave.\r\nIt is one of the most striking natural curiosities in the Chickasaw\r\nnation. The caves are of unknown length, and through one rushes a\r\nsubterranean stream of great depth in places and of icy coldness.\r\nExploring parties have ventured into these labyrinths for hundreds\r\nof yards, but the danger of becoming lost has prevented a thorough\r\nexamination of the underground passages.\r\n\r\nThe cave leading westward is easiest of access and contains a number\r\nof spacious chambers. The room is about seventy feet square and fifty\r\nfeet from the floor to the ceiling. The floor is obstructed with huge\r\nboulders. The darkness and stillness are intense. Picnic parties\r\nsometimes go there, and, with a huge boulder for a table, eat their\r\nlunch in the glare of torches that cast uncanny shadows along the\r\nmassive walls.\r\n\r\nTimid persons hesitate in venturing into the depths of the eastern\r\ncave. The passage slants downward at an angle that compels the explorer\r\nto crawl and slip and slide for nearly 100 feet before reaching a spot\r\nwhere a person may stand upright and walk safely. From the darkness\r\nechoes the sound of rushing water, which later is found to be a stream\r\nthat runs from eight to thirty feet in width, and from six inches\r\nto many feet in depth. Men have waded in the stream until the water\r\nreached their chins, and then gone in a boat to points where they were\r\nunable to touch bottom with the longest oars. A farmer carried his\r\nboat into the cave several years ago to follow the stream to its end.\r\nAt a depth estimated to be 200 feet below the surface of the ground is\r\na natural bridge, formed by a huge stone that fell across the stream.\r\nThe water plunges underneath this bridge like a millrace. A boat can\r\nbe pulled over the bridge, however, and launched on the other side.\r\nAbout 100 feet below the bridge the stream widens into a broad, deep\r\npool, with a high, vaulted roof. Beautiful stalagmites and stalactites\r\nadorn this chamber. Two hundred feet below this pool the passage is\r\ndifficult. It is claimed that this cave has been explored for a mile.\r\n\r\nThe stream is believed to find its outlet at a spring about three\r\nmiles from the entrance to the caves. This spring is of great size\r\nand volume, and flows with remarkable swiftness. In rainy seasons the\r\nspring boils and gushes as if choked with the flood of water that pours\r\nfrom its mouth. The stream in Black Prairie cave rises when there is a\r\nheavy rainfall in the surrounding country, and the increased flow of\r\nboth springs and stream at such times is taken as evidence that they\r\nare connected.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTESIAN WATERS IN TEXAS.\r\n\r\nIn the south central part of Texas is an upland covering an area\r\nof 14,000 square miles, and known as the Edwards Plateau. At the\r\nsoutheastern foot of this elevated tract there is no end of gushing\r\nsprings, which form the headwaters of the San Antonio and San Marcos\r\nrivers. In a big State like Texas, the rainfall of one locality often\r\nvaries a good deal from that of adjacent regions. But, according to\r\na bulletin of the United States Geological Survey, the fluctuations\r\nof discharge of the streams just mentioned correspond closely to\r\nthe rainfall up on the plateau, from which it is inferred that some\r\ninvisible connection exists between the springs and the upland. The\r\nbulletin declares that this similarity has been found to hold true for\r\ndry and wet years alike. The Edwards Plateau is a flat, grass covered\r\nupland. The rain which falls upon it does not flow off in surface\r\nstreams, but sinks into the porous soil, and eventually finds its way\r\nunderground to the bold scarp line of the region, where it bursts out\r\nin abundant springs.\r\n\r\nThe San Antonio River has its source in one of these artesian springs,\r\nand between it and the wells driven to supply water to the city of\r\nSan Antonio there seems to be close connection, shown in their mutual\r\nchanges, which indicates that their waters have a common source. It\r\nwas recently noticed that when the wells were steadily drawn upon for\r\ntwenty-four hours the water level of the head lake of the river fell\r\nseveral inches, but that on shutting off the wells the lake regained\r\nits level in about one day. So intimate is the relation between the\r\nflow of the wells and that of the river that it is always possible\r\nto tell how high the water will rise in the former by observing the\r\nriver’s height on a gauge rod placed upon its bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ASSAM EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nA thorough report of the earthquake in Assam, in 1897, the most violent\r\nand extended earthquake of historic times, has been made by Mr. R.\r\nD. Oldham. From an abstract by Prof. Davis of Harvard University, it\r\nappears that an area of 150,000 square miles was laid in ruins, all\r\nmeans of communication interrupted, the hills rent asunder and cast\r\ndown in the landslips, the plains fissured and riddled with vents from\r\nwhich sand and water poured forth in astounding quantities, causing\r\nfloods in the rivers, etc. A surrounding area of 1,750,000 square\r\nmiles felt a shock of unusual energy. The earthquake wave traveled\r\nat the rate of 120 miles a minute. The vertical displacement of the\r\nground near the center of disturbance was probably as much as fourteen\r\ninches--an unprecedented quantity; the vertical movement of earthquakes\r\nof great violence, like the Charleston earthquake, is seldom more than\r\ntwo inches.\r\n\r\nSome of the results of this great earthquake of June 12, 1897, are\r\nastonishing. Faults were produced, one having a throw of 25 feet and\r\na length of 12 miles; another a throw of 10 feet and a length of 2½\r\nmiles. The larger of the two dammed a river so as to form a lake\r\nseveral miles in extent and ruining a forest of at least 50,000 trees.\r\nLandslides of great magnitude were produced in the Himalayas and the\r\nvalleys of streams were changed beyond recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS RESULT OF THE EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 1.--An interesting point in connection with the\r\nearthquake which was felt in this city yesterday is the fact that a\r\nnumber of small Indiana streams having their source in the southern\r\nborder of the gas belt have suddenly filled with water. No rains have\r\noccurred in this State for months to swell the streams, and in the case\r\nof Honey Creek, in the eastern part of Bartholemew County, it had gone\r\ndry several weeks ago, the water standing only in pools here and there.\r\nThis week it is filled to the brim, and in some places has overflowed.\r\nSugar Creek, that runs near Edinburg, Johnson County, was nearly dry,\r\nbut to-day it is reported to be nearly filled. Smaller streams rising\r\nin the Hancock County gas territory have shown similar phenomena. No\r\none can imagine where the water comes from. In the case of Honey Creek\r\nthe records show that previous to the Charleston earthquake, August 31,\r\n1886, the stream acted in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VILLAGE DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE, May 27.--The village of Repahie in Armenia has been\r\ndestroyed by an earthquake. A number of mineral springs spouted from\r\nthe crevasses made in the earth by the shocks and the flow of water\r\nwas so great that the adjacent fields were flooded. The earthquake was\r\npreceded by rumblings which caused the inhabitants to flee from the\r\nvillage and they thus escaped death from the falling houses. No lives\r\nwere lost however.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince a recent earthquake at Santa Ana, in Orange County, Cal., the\r\nwell of Mr. Huntington in Los Bolsas district, which for years\r\nhas never flowed to any considerable extent, has given forth large\r\nquantities of mud, stones and other materials, the eruptions being\r\nvolcanic in character. The supply of water is now far in excess of\r\nthe means provided at the surface for its care, and it has been found\r\nnecessary to ditch from the well to the river to carry it away. The\r\npipes are at all times in danger of bursting--the sudden blasts of air\r\nand foreign substances rendering it more or less dangerous to go near\r\nthe opening.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE BANKED FOR YEARS.\r\n\r\n_From the Galveston Daily News._\r\n\r\nORANGE, Tex., Feb. 21.--J. W. Link is filling in some low lots with\r\nashes and charcoal that he is hauling from the pit where A. Gilmer at\r\none time burned the slabs and refuse that came from his sawmill. The\r\nmill was destroyed by fire Sept. 13, 1899. When the wagons commenced\r\nhauling the mound of ashes was 20 feet high and nearly 40 feet in\r\ndiameter at the bottom, tapering as it went up.\r\n\r\nTo-day when the men had worked in about 15 feet, but before they had\r\nreached the center of the heap, the teamsters discovered smoke issuing\r\nfrom the charcoal as it was being brought in contact with the air.\r\nOne of them felt of his shovel and was startled to find it very hot.\r\nHe picked up a piece of charcoal and blew it with his breath, when it\r\ndeveloped into a blaze of fire. The experiment was repeated several\r\ntimes to-day and each time the charred lump would become a live coal.\r\nThe ashes were about 16 feet thick that stood above the live coals, and\r\nfrom the outer edge to where the hot ashes were first discovered, a\r\nlittle above the ground the fine ashes were fully as thick.\r\n\r\nNo smoke has been seen to come from the big ash pile for nearly two\r\nand a half years, and these coals have been in their present resting\r\nplace probably for a longer period, as the cone-shaped mound was much\r\nlarger when the mill was destroyed than it was at the time the wagons\r\ncommenced removing the ashes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Volcano of Kilauea is very active at present. The cavity produced\r\nby the last breakdown has not filled up, but there is an active lake\r\n200 to 300 feet below the general level of the floor and a quarter of a\r\nmile in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WHOLE VALLEY LAID IN WASTE.\r\n\r\nFIFTEEN CRATERS DESTROY WHAT WAS ONCE A DELIGHTFUL SPOT.\r\n\r\nLUNAHUANA, United States of Colombia, March 30, 1891.--This beautiful\r\nvalley has experienced a topographical change, and I may now call a\r\ndesert that which was formerly a delightful spot. Fifteen craters\r\nhave been constantly at work since Sunday, March 22, throwing out\r\nmasses of mud and water which on its precipitate descent and with the\r\ngreat strength of the current, is carrying ruin in all directions and\r\nsweeping houses before it, together with their inhabitants and the\r\ncattle, vineyards, farms and irrigation works.\r\n\r\nAll the roads north and south of here have been converted into ditches,\r\nthrough which the water is continually pouring, and all communication\r\nbetween Canete and Chincha is interrupted, while the bridge across the\r\nriver has been swept away.\r\n\r\nThe numerous victims who have suffered, the deep impression caused by\r\nthe destruction of all the irrigation ditches, the fact that it will\r\nbe impossible to gather the remainder of the crop of grapes, and the\r\ncertainty that the necessities of life will reach famine prices, lead\r\nme to suggest that the government should take steps on behalf of the\r\nresidents here. Hundreds of families have been left without homes and\r\nare camping out on the hillsides, the only clothes they have being\r\nthose in which they escaped. They are preparing to cross the ravines,\r\nas the floods may sweep down upon them at any moment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interesting geological phenomenon is noticed in the district of\r\nIzium, in Kharkoy, Russia. In consequence of the heat this summer\r\nthe ground broke open in many places and deep ditches formed, at the\r\nbottom of which subterranean water appeared. Geologists who examined\r\nthe ground think that the subterranean water comes from the same source\r\nwhich supplies the Slavinskoye salt lakes of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HIVE OF VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\nOVER THREE THOUSAND ACTIVE VOLCANOES IN LOWER CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nSAN DIEGO, Cal., July 25.--The San Diegan to-day publishes a\r\ndescriptive account by Colonel I. K. Allen, the well-known engineer,\r\nof a phenomena in what is known as the volcano region of the Cocapah\r\nMountains, situated sixty-five miles southwest of Yuma in Lower\r\nCalifornia. Colonel Allen says there are over three thousand active\r\nvolcanoes there, one-half of which are small cones, ten or twelve\r\nfeet at the base, the remaining half five to forty feet at the base,\r\nand fifteen to twenty-five in height. The whole volcanic region is\r\nencrusted with sulphur. One peculiar feature of the region is a lake of\r\nwater jet black, which is a quarter of a mile in length and an eighth\r\nof a mile in width, seemingly bottomless. The water is hot and salty.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TUNNEL A LIME KILN.\r\n\r\nTHE SANTA FE MAY HAVE TO ABANDON ITS JOHNSON CANYON ROUTE.\r\n\r\nLOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 31.--The Fairview tunnel through the mountains\r\nat Johnson’s canyon, near Williams, Ariz., is again on fire and the\r\nofficials of the Santa Fe Pacific fear that they may be compelled to\r\nabandon the tunnel, as they are at a loss to devise means to extinguish\r\nthe flames. Investigation shows conclusively that the new fire was\r\ncaused by spontaneous combustion. The tunnel is now nothing but the\r\nflue for an immense lime kiln. The mountain through which the tunnel\r\npasses is chiefly limestone of a high degree of purity.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC OUTBURST PROBABLE.\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO, Cal., July 1.--News from Susanville, in the Sierra\r\nNevadas, says that slight earthquake shocks continue and that the\r\npeople have been so accustomed to the constant trembling of the earth\r\nthat they pay no attention to it. The shocks, however, have revived\r\nrecollections of old settlers who predict volcanic disturbances in the\r\nextinct craters, such as there were in 1850.\r\n\r\nSusanville lies in a highly mountainous walled valley directly east of\r\nLassen Butte, an extinct volcano 10,000 feet high. From its summit no\r\nless than forty extinct craters can be seen. Cinder Cone, which rises\r\n600 feet above the level of the plateau, was in eruption in 1850. Two\r\nprospectors examined it and found Lake Saltafara, miles south of Cinder\r\nCone, a center of volcanic forces. The lake was a mass of boiling water\r\nand mud and from it vast columns of flames shot up at intervals. The\r\ntimber in the vicinity was on fire. Within the last few years there has\r\nseemed renewed activity in the internal fires and the present shocks\r\npoint to the possibility of another great volcanic outburst which will\r\nfind vent through some of the old craters.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESOLATED BY ERUPTIONS.\r\n\r\nFIFTEEN NEW CRATERS DESTROY MANY HOMES AND RUIN A WIDE AREA IN CHILI.\r\n\r\nPANAMA, April 26.--Regarding the eruptions in the Lunahuana district of\r\nChili, the Lima _Opinion National_ has published the following letter\r\ndated March 30:\r\n\r\n“This beautiful valley has experienced a topographical change, and\r\nI may now call a desert that which was formerly a delightful spot.\r\nFifteen craters have been continually at work since Sunday, the\r\n22d, throwing out masses of mud, which, in its precipitate descent\r\nand with the monstrous strength of the current, is carrying ruin in\r\nall directions and sweeping houses before it, together with their\r\ninhabitants and the cattle, vineyards, farms, and irrigation works. All\r\nthe roads north and south of here have been converted into ditches,\r\nthrough which water is continually pouring, and all communication\r\nbetween Canete and Chincha is interrupted, while the bridge across the\r\nriver has been swept away. Hundreds of families have been left without\r\nhomes and are camping out on the hillsides, the only clothes they have\r\nbeing those in which they escaped. They are preparing to cross the\r\nravines, as the floods may sweep down upon them at any moment.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIER ICE.\r\n\r\nGlacier ice is not like the solid blue ice on the surface of the water,\r\nbut consists of granules joined together by an intricate network of\r\ncapillary water, filled fissures. In exposed sections and upon the\r\nsurface of the ice can be observed “veined” or “banded” structure\r\nveins of a denser blue color alternating with those of a lighter shade\r\ncontaining air bubbles. The cause of this peculiar structure has been\r\nthe subject of much theorizing among investigators, but hitherto the\r\ngreatest authorities consider that the explanation of the phenomenon is\r\nyet wanting.--_Goldthwaite’s Geographical Magazine._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONGEST GLACIER IN THE TEMPERATE ZONE ASCENDED BY MR. CONWAY.\r\n\r\nMr. W. M. Conway, who was sent out by the Royal Geographical Society\r\nof London last spring to explore the Kara Koram Mountains and their\r\nmighty glaciers north of Cashmere, has accomplished the most brilliant\r\nfeats of mountain and glacier climbing that any explorer has achieved\r\nin years. He has sent to the society a report of his ascent of the\r\nBaltoro glacier, over forty miles in length and the longest glacier\r\nthat is known in temperate regions, and of his ascent of an ice-covered\r\nmountain over 23,000 feet high at the upper end of the glacier.\r\n\r\nHe began the ascent of the Baltoro glacier on Aug. 5. He had little\r\nidea on starting of the discomforts before him. His party included\r\nthree Englishmen besides himself, an Alpine guide, and four Sepoys\r\ndetailed from an Indian regiment. Fully two-thirds of the entire length\r\nof the glacier was so completely covered with stone debris that the ice\r\nwas not visible except where lakes or crevasses occurred. He was unable\r\nto ascend along the banks at the sides of the glacier, for they were\r\nnot traversable. He was therefore forced to go up the horrible middle\r\nof the ice. The surface was not flat, but was a series of prodigious\r\nmounds. He measured one of them, which was over 200 feet high, and it\r\nwas usually easier to climb over these mounds than to circumvent them.\r\nThe stones that rested upon the ice were constantly giving way under\r\nfoot. The consequence was that the progress of the heavily laden Sepoys\r\nwas slow and the marches had to be short.\r\n\r\nThe party was nearly two weeks ascending this icy river, four days\r\nof which time they remained in camp on account of stormy weather.\r\nWhen they finally turned up a tributary glacier in order to ascend\r\nthe mountain, they had reached a height of 16,000 feet above the\r\nsea. All through the journey the cold was very severe. The party was\r\nvery heavily laden because in addition to their food supplies it was\r\nnecessary to carry a quantity of fuel.\r\n\r\nIt was not until Aug. 25, twenty days after they had left the foot of\r\nthe glacier, that they began the assaults upon the icy peak which they\r\nintended to surmount. Two or three of the party had become disabled\r\nby cold and fatigue, and had to return to a camp established on the\r\nglacier. The party complained of some discomforts which travelers\r\namong the Himalayas have often mentioned. The sun, day after day came\r\nout with scorching power, and while their feet were numbed with cold,\r\ntheir bodies were far too hot to be comfortable. Mr. Conway says the\r\ngreat variations between biting cold and grilling heat are the chief\r\nimpediments to mountaineering at high altitudes in those regions. Not\r\nonly the cold and the heat alike are hard to endure, but the change\r\nfrom one to the other seems to weaken the forces and render the whole\r\nbody feeble.\r\n\r\nAscending the steep slope of the final peak, their climbing irons were\r\nof the greatest assistance. They found to their dismay after climbing\r\na few hundred feet that the upper part of _the peak was not of snow,\r\nbut of hard, blue ice, covered with a thin layer of snow. Every step\r\nthey took had to be cut through the snow into the ice. The ice was too\r\nhard for the steel points of the climbing irons to penetrate until\r\nit had been prepared by a stroke or two of the ax._ The Alpine guide\r\nsaid the work of step cutting was far more fatiguing than he had ever\r\nexperienced in Switzerland. One of the Sepoys was overtaken by mountain\r\nsickness and had to be left behind. Now and then a puff of air inspired\r\nthe party with a little life. Most of the time they suffered from the\r\nrarefication of the air.\r\n\r\nReaching the top, about 23,000 feet above the sea, Conway named the\r\nmountain Pioneer Point. He saw the most glorious views on every side.\r\nThe whole panorama of valley, mountain, glacier, and snow has an\r\neffect, at an elevation, of majestic repose. The observers were far\r\nabove the noises of avalanches and rivers and nature’s forces were\r\nreduced to mere insignificance as they gazed thousands of feet below\r\nthem upon the scenery. Many of the mountains they saw had not before\r\nbeen seen by human eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER GULF STREAM FROM SAME SOURCE.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the North Pacific ocean resembles the North Atlantic.\r\nA great warm current, much like the Gulf Stream, and of equal\r\nmagnitude, called the Black Stream, or Japan current, runs northward\r\nalong the eastern shore of Asia. Close to the east coast of Japan it\r\nflows through a marine valley which holds the deepest water in the\r\nworld. It was sounded at a depth of 5¼ miles by the United States\r\nsteamer Tuscaroa in 1875, while surveying for a projected cable route\r\nbetween the United States and Japan. The heavy sounding weight took\r\nmore than an hour to sink to the bottom. But trial was made of a chasm\r\nyet more profound, where the lead did not fetch it up at all. It is the\r\nonly depth of ocean that remains unfathomed.--_San Francisco Examiner._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the head of Onion Valley, in Inyo County, Cal., are two abrupt\r\nmountains, one 13,000 and the other 14,000 feet high. Tumbling down\r\nthe side of one is a cataract 500 feet high, which in the distance\r\nresembles falling snow, and two other waterfalls of equal height are\r\nvisible from the head of the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE ON THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nMR. DRUMMOND THINKS HE HAS FOUND WHERE ITS WATERS COME FROM.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of Lake Ontario, southwest of the Canadian city of\r\nKingston, is a lake situated on a height of land one side of which\r\nforms a cliff. It is just south of the arm of Lake Ontario known\r\nas Quinte Bay and it stands 180 feet above the bay. There is no\r\nopportunity for surface waters to flow into this little lake and no one\r\nhas the slightest idea whence it derives its waters, which are clear\r\nand fresh. The lake is about one and a half miles long with a width of\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile.\r\n\r\nMr. A. T. Drummond recently wrote a letter to _Nature_, in which he\r\nsaid he believed he had solved the mystery of the invisible inflow,\r\nwhich cannot possibly be attributed to springs from any higher ground\r\nin the neighborhood. In his opinion the source of the lake is to be\r\nfound in the Trenton limestone area some twenty-five or thirty miles to\r\nthe northeast. There is a steady rise in these rocks to the north and\r\ntheir dip is favorable to sending the water that sinks through the soil\r\nto them southward to the region of Lake Ontario. Fifty miles away the\r\nrocks have a height of 400 feet above the lake.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the bearing of these rocks upon the origin of\r\nthe inflow, Mr. Drummond last summer made a series of soundings in\r\nthe little lake. The largest part of the lake is shallow, but along\r\nits southern edge he found a great rent in the bottom nearly a mile\r\nlong and a third of a mile wide. In this rent the depths varied from\r\nseventy-five to 100 feet. He says the rent is probably due to a wide\r\nfault or breakage in the Trenton limestone, and he believes that the\r\nsame forces that gave rise to this fault may account for a subterranean\r\nconnection with the higher ground many miles to the north through which\r\nthe water finds its way into the little lake that overlooks Ontario.\r\nMr. Drummond’s theory is the most plausible that has yet been suggested\r\nto account for the source from which this mysterious lake receives its\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BOILING LAKE.\r\n\r\nThere is a lake of boiling water in the Island of Dominica, lying in\r\nthe mountains behind Roseau, and in the valleys surrounding it are many\r\nsolfataras, or volcanic sulphur vents. In fact, the boiling lake is\r\nlittle better than a crater filled with scalding water, constantly fed\r\nby mountain streams, and through which the pent-up gases find vent and\r\nare ejected. The temperature of the water on the margins of the lake\r\nranges from 180° to 190° Fahrenheit; in the middle, exactly over the\r\ngas vents, it is believed to be about 300°. Where this active action\r\ntakes place the water is said to rise two, three, or even four feet\r\nabove the general surface level of the lake, the cone often dividing so\r\nthat the orifices through which the gas escapes are legion in number.\r\nThis violent disturbance over the gas jets causes a violent action\r\nover the whole surface of the lake, and, though the cones appear to be\r\nspecial vents, the sulphurous vapors rise with equal density over its\r\nentire surface. Contrary to what one would naturally suppose, there\r\nseems to be in no case violent action of the escaping gases, such as\r\nexplosions or detonations. The water is of dark gray color, and having\r\nbeen boiled over and over for thousands of years, has become thick and\r\nslimy with sulphur. As the inlets to the lake are rapidly closing,\r\nit is believed that it will soon assume the character of a geyser or\r\nsulphurous crater.--_St. Louis Republic._\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNCANNY LAKE.\r\n\r\nThere is in Missouri a lake, perched on the top of a mountain, its\r\nsurface from 50 to 100 feet below the level of the earth surrounding\r\nit, fed by no surface streams, untouched by the wind, dead as the\r\nsea of Sodom. There is no point of equal altitude from which water\r\ncould flow within hundreds of miles, and yet it has a periodical rise\r\nof 30 feet or over, which is in no way affected by the atmospheric\r\nconditions in the country adjacent. It may rain for weeks in Webster\r\nCounty, and the return of fair weather will find Devil’s Lake at its\r\nlowest point, while it may reach its highest point during a protracted\r\ndrouth.--_St. Louis Globe-Democrat._\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS LAKE IN THE WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, Oct. 14.--_Editor of the Herald_:--In your very interesting\r\n“Missing Links” of to-day you mention the great sunken lake in the\r\nCascade Mountains as the most deeply sunken lake in the world. This\r\nreminded me of a lake similar to this which I visited while traveling\r\nin the West Indies in 1891. This lake is situated in the island of St.\r\nVincent on the highest peak of the Souffrière range of mountains, 4,500\r\nfeet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is one mile and a half down to the surface of the water and like the\r\nCascade Lake the depth of the water is unknown.\r\n\r\nSoundings were taken many years ago by Lieutenant Smith, of the United\r\nStates navy, but with no result. The lake is almost a complete circle\r\nand is about three or four miles in circumference.\r\n\r\nThe color of the water is light olive, but there are times when it\r\nchanges to an intense yellow and is saturated with sulphur. It was in\r\nthe latter state that I saw it in 1891, and so thick was the sulphur\r\nthat two of our party who ventured to bathe came out with a thin\r\ncoating of sulphur on many parts of their body and emitting so strong\r\nan odor that we were forced to quarantine them for some hours.\r\n\r\n                                                          ED FITZGERALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOFTY LAKES OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe most loftily situated lakes are found among the Himalaya Mountains\r\nin Thibet. Their altitudes do not, however, seem to have been\r\naccurately gauged, for different authorities give widely different\r\nfigures regarding them. According to some, Lake Manasurovara, one of\r\nthe sacred lakes of Thibet, is between 19,000 and 20,000 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, and if this is so it is undoubtedly the loftiest lake\r\nin the world. Two other Thibetan lakes, those of Cholamoo and Surakol,\r\nare stated to be 17,000 and 15,400 feet in altitude respectively. For\r\na long time it was supposed that Lake Titicaca, in South America, was\r\nthe loftiest in the world. It covers about 4,500 square miles, and\r\nis 924 feet above the sea. In spite of inexactitude with regard to\r\nthe measurements of the elevation of the Thibetan lakes, they are,\r\nno doubt, considerably higher than this and any others.--_New York\r\nTelegram._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER STILL RISES.\r\n\r\nQUEER PRANKS OF A LAKE AS AN EFFECT OF AN EARTHQUAKE SHOCK.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, September 18.--To-day’s _Herald_ has these cable dispatches:\r\n\r\n“SAN SALVADOR, VIA GALVESTON, TEX., September 12, 1891.--The waters in\r\nLlapango Cojutepeque, or Illabasco Lake, as it is variously known, keep\r\non rising. The workmen sent by the government to open an outlet to the\r\nocean are still hard at work.\r\n\r\n“The shocks continue to be felt at irregular intervals. The earthquake\r\nof September 8 was experienced all over the country. The material\r\nlosses are estimated at $500,000, although this seems a low figure.\r\n\r\n“News was received here this morning from Guatemala City that\r\nex-vice-President Dr. Rafeel Aola had been accidentally shot and\r\nkilled while attempting to separate two of his friends who were\r\nengaged in a quarrel.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the extreme eastern edge of Arizona there is a great shallow salt\r\nlake in a bowl-like depression, the sink itself being some hundreds of\r\nfeet deep and three miles across. The basin, all the portion of it not\r\ntaken up by the lake, is dazzling white with millions upon millions\r\nof salt crystals. In the center of the lake rises what appears to be\r\na cone-shaped volcanic peak. Should you take the trouble to ford the\r\nlake you will find a miniature lake in the middle of the peak clear as\r\ncrystal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEEPEST LAKE KNOWN.\r\n\r\nBy far the deepest lake in the world is Lake Baikal, in Siberia, which\r\nis in every way comparable to the great Canadian lakes as regards size;\r\nfor, while its area of over 9,000 square miles makes it about equal to\r\nLake Erie in superficial extent, its enormous depth of between 4,000\r\nand 4,500 feet makes the volume of its waters almost equal to that of\r\nLake Superior. Although its surface is 1,350 feet above the sea level,\r\nits bottom is nearly 3,000 feet below it. The Caspian Lake, or Sea, as\r\nit is usually called, has a depth in its southern basin of over 3,000\r\nfeet. Lake Maggiore is 2,800 feet deep, Lake Como nearly 2,000 feet,\r\nand Lagodi-Garda, another Italian lake, has a depth in certain places\r\nof 1,900 feet. Lake Constance is over 1,000 feet deep, and Huron and\r\nMichigan reach depths of 900 and 1,000 feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBlowout Mountains in the cascades above Breitenbush, Ore., is\r\nunmistakably one of the wonders of the cascades, consisting of about\r\neight hundred acres of granite rock piled up in every conceivable\r\nshape. From all indications it has been caused by an accumulation of\r\ngas below, which bursting out threw the rock into the cañon, forming a\r\nbeautiful lake from twenty to thirty rods wide and half a mile long, in\r\nwhich abound myriads of trout.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA peculiar fish, of brown color, without scales, and weighing\r\ntwenty-one pounds, was caught in a net at New Dorp, Staten Island, this\r\nweek, by the lighthouse keeper. In forty years’ fishing the keeper has\r\nnever seen a similar fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAMMOTH SPRING.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most wonderful spring of fresh water in the world is on\r\nthe gulf coast of Florida in Hernando County. The Wekowechee River, a\r\nstream large enough to float a small steamer, is made entirely of water\r\nspouted from this gigantic natural well, which is 60 feet in diameter\r\nand about 70 or 80 feet deep. Chemists who have analyzed the water say\r\nthat there is not a trace of organic matter in its composition, and\r\nthat it is the most pure and fresh of any spring in America. A dime\r\ntossed into the spring can be seen lying on the bottom as plainly as it\r\ncould in a glass of common well water. The steamer which makes regular\r\nexcursion trips up and down the Wekowechee is often floated into the\r\ncavity of the spring, but cannot be made to stay in the center, as\r\nthe force of the rising water forces it to the sides of the basin.\r\nThe spring and 2,000 acres of land adjoining belong to two Chicago\r\ncapitalists, who are making it a pleasure resort.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD’S LARGEST SPRING.\r\n\r\nAt Mammoth Spring, Ark., and under the shadow of the Ozark Mountains,\r\nis the largest spring in the world. The water comes up in such a body\r\nthat it forms a lake about the orifice. The output of the spring is\r\n29,600,000 gallons daily. Records have been kept of it for ten years,\r\nand during that time the output has not varied 100 gallons a day nor\r\nthe temperature a single degree. Winter and summer the spring remains\r\nat 59 degrees. The spring is evidently the outlet of some underground\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Poncho springs in Colorado are all on the side of a mountain, and\r\nhot and cold water flows from the ground in places not more than three\r\ninches apart.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESH WATER FROM A SALT BAY.\r\n\r\n_From the Florida Times-Union and Citizen._\r\n\r\nBELLEAIR, March 3.--The Eldridge spring is quite an attraction to the\r\nvisitors; it furnishes drink water for the hotel. It is out in the bay,\r\nbut is cemented up, so as to keep out the salt water, and throws up\r\n100,000 gallons of water per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA species of eyeless fish has been found in a subterranean boiling\r\nspring discovered in a Nevada mine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe motion of the earth around the sun is 68,305 miles an hour; over\r\n1,000 miles a minute, or nineteen miles a second.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STRANGE POND.\r\n\r\nHicks Pond, in Palmyra, Me., is a strange body of water. It is only\r\ntwelve acres in area, but it is more than 100 feet in depth. It has no\r\nvisible inlet, although a fair sized stream flows from it into Lake\r\nSebasticook. The volume of its waters is not materially affected by\r\neither drouth or freshet, and the water is always cold.--_Philadelphia\r\nLedger._\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERS BENEATH THE SURFACE.\r\n\r\nWorkmen engaged in sinking an artesian well in Sandy Valley, near\r\nNiria, N. M., struck an open seam, from which a cold stream of air\r\nrushed with force enough to remove a 12-pound rock laid over the\r\nopening. The air was charged with millions of small yellow bugs, each\r\nhaving but two legs, no wings and a small red circle on his back. They\r\nlived but a few seconds after striking the warm outside air. Local\r\nscientists are puzzling over the question: How did they get so far down\r\ninto the earth?--_St. Louis Republic._\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH IN AN OLD WELL.\r\n\r\nSome queer fish were taken out of the recently reopened well on the\r\nUnited States fish station at San Marcos, Texas, says the Louisville\r\n_Courier-Journal_. There were several salamanders, varying in length\r\nfrom an inch and a half to four and a half inches. These creatures live\r\non land or water, have human-looking faces, hands and feet, bulldog\r\nhead, tail of an eel and body of fish. There were also large numbers of\r\nshrimps, resembling sea shrimps, only much smaller. It is an artesian\r\nwell, and everybody wants to know where the creatures come from.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA wonderful artesian well is in flourishing activity at Huron, N. D. It\r\nthrows a stream 100 feet high, and the flow is estimated at from 8,000\r\nto 10,000 gallons a minute.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. WINIFRED’S WELL.\r\n\r\nOne of the most copious springs in Great Britain is the famed St.\r\nWinifred’s well, near the town of Holywell, in Flintshire. The well is\r\nan oblong square, about twelve feet by seven, and its water, say the\r\npeople of the district, has never been known to freeze. This latter\r\nassertion may be true, as besides containing a fair percentage of\r\nmineral matter that lowers its freezing point, the well is inside a\r\nbeautiful chapel, which was erected over it by Queen Margaret, the\r\nmother of Henry VII. The water thrown up is not less than eighty-four\r\nhogsheads every minute, and the quantity appears to vary very little\r\neither in drouth or after the heaviest rain, showing doubtless that its\r\nprimitive sources are numerous and widely distributed. Sir Winifred’s\r\nhas been the object of many pilgrimages.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTEZUMA’S WELL.\r\n\r\nOne of the most pleasing natural curiosities in the Territory of\r\nArizona is the pool of water known as Montezuma’s well. It is situated\r\nfifteen miles northeast of the old abandoned military post known as\r\nCape Verde. It is 25 feet in diameter, and the clear, pure water is\r\nabout sixty feet below the surface of the surrounding country. Some\r\nyears ago certain military officers sounded the pool and found that\r\nit had a uniform depth of eighty feet of water, except in one place,\r\napparently about six feet square, where the sounding line went down\r\nabout 500 feet without touching bottom.\r\n\r\nThe well empties into Beaver Creek, only about 100 yards distant,\r\nthe water gushing forth from the rocks as though it were under great\r\npressure. The well is undoubtedly supplied from subterranean sources,\r\npossibly through the hole sounded by the army officers years ago. The\r\nsides of the well are honeycombed with caves and tunnels, permitting\r\nsightseers to descend to the water’s edge.\r\n\r\nMontezuma’s well contains no fish. The flow of water from it is the\r\nsame throughout the season. Popular opinion has attributed the origin\r\nof the well to volcanic action, but as the rock surrounding it is\r\nlimestone, it is more than probable that the action of the water is\r\nresponsible for its creation.--_Native American._\r\n\r\n\r\nA REMARKABLE ISLAND.\r\n\r\n_From the Pittsburg Dispatch._\r\n\r\nA rim of land inclosing a fresh-water lake in the middle of the Pacific\r\nOcean is a novelty in the way of islands. There may not be more than\r\none such in the great ocean, and, at any rate, that type of island is\r\nextremely rare. This strange spot is Niuafou, which is quite apart from\r\nother ocean islands. It lies midway between the Fiji and Samoa groups,\r\nand is under the government of the Tonga group, though it is 200 miles\r\nfrom these islands.\r\n\r\nIt has recently been visited by Lieutenant Somerville, of the British\r\nNavy. Some time or other a volcanic vent opened at the bottom of the\r\nocean, and the lava that poured out of it piled up higher and higher,\r\nuntil it finally overtopped the sea. A great volcanic mountain had\r\nbeen formed, and the part of it that came into view above the waste\r\nof waters was, of course, an island. As time went on this volcano was\r\nthe scene of one of those tremendous explosions that sometimes tear\r\nmountains to pieces. It was such a cataclysm that blew off the upper\r\n3,000 feet of Krakatoa some years ago.\r\n\r\nThe explosion at Niuafou had a remarkable result. The interior of\r\nthe crater was blown out to a considerable depth, leaving only the\r\nnarrow rim, in this case a nearly perfect ring, around the deep central\r\ncavity. Such is the island of to-day.\r\n\r\nA thousand Tongans live in the five villages that lie along the outer\r\nslope of that crater wall. The drainage from the inner slope has\r\npartly filled the cavity, forming a lake whose waters, though slightly\r\nalkaline, are drinkable. From the top of the crater rim one looks down\r\nupon the peaceful lake within, with its three little islands and the\r\ncuriously shaped peninsula jutting out into it; and outside the rim is\r\nthe ever-restless ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE THE VALLEY WAS A HILL IS.\r\n\r\n_From the Chicago Record._\r\n\r\nSEATTLE, Wash., April 6.--A tremendous upheaval, accompanied by\r\nwonderful changes, occurred in the Mount Baker district March 27. What\r\nhad once been a valley and the bed of a river is now a hill seventy\r\nfeet high. The noise of the upheaval was heard at Hamilton, ten miles\r\naway. A report of the occurrence was brought to the city by D. P.\r\nSimons, Jr.\r\n\r\nSimons says the noise of the upheaval sounded like heavy thunder. He\r\nand his party, who were examining timber lands, journeyed in the\r\ndirection from which the sound came, and were astonished to see a huge\r\nmound of earth, nearly a quarter of a mile square, where formerly there\r\nhad been a valley. In places the mound was seventy feet high. The\r\nNooksachk River had been turned from its course, and ran around one\r\nside of a hill. Nearly in the center of this high bank of earth was a\r\nlarge lake. A forest had formerly occupied the ground, and trees which\r\nhad escaped destruction rose above the water. There were cracks here\r\nand there in the mound large enough to ingulf a horse and wagon. There\r\nwas a smell of sulphur in the air, and it is Mr. Simons’s impression\r\nthat the disturbance was caused by gases underneath the mountain.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hadley, a trapper, whose wrecked cabin now stands in the center\r\nof the huge mound, was absent at the time of the upheaval, and thus\r\nescaped death. His cabin was split in two.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE GEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\nAccording to a Florida paper a remarkable geological discovery has been\r\nmade there. The _Galena Advocate_ says: “As P. M. Oliver, in company\r\nwith a lot of friends, was chasing a fox through his field near Payne’s\r\nprairie Saturday night last his horse ran into a sink and in getting\r\nthe animal out Sunday morning attention was attracted to the numerous\r\ncurious petrological formations on the sides of the sink. Further\r\nexamination Monday disclosed immense beds of the petrified bones of the\r\nnow extinct dinotherium giganteum, icthyosaurus, glyptodon, cuvieri,\r\nplesiosaurus, and peterodactyl. This is probably the richest find in\r\nthe world and was altogether accidental.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTUNNELLING FOR WATER.\r\n\r\nFOLKS OUT IN IDAHO WHO RUN THEIR WELLS INTO A SIDE HILL.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Sweet, Canyon County, Idaho, have a novel way of\r\nobtaining water for domestic and irrigation purposes. The water is dug\r\nout of the hillside, with wells run like tunnels, and not down into the\r\nearth as ordinary wells are dug. East of the town, there is a bluff out\r\nof which sparkling mountain water can be procured almost anywhere by\r\nmerely running a tunnel in from twenty to forty feet.\r\n\r\nAt one point in town, a stream sufficient to irrigate a fine orchard\r\nand garden, besides an ample supply for domestic use and for watering\r\nall the teams that pass that way, comes pouring out of the 40-foot\r\ntunnel. Neither the spring freshets nor the summer drouths affect its\r\nflow.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINICA’S BOILING LAKE.\r\n\r\nA NATURAL CURIOSITY THAT WAS NOT DISCOVERED TILL 1875.\r\n\r\nMr. Sterns-Fadelle of Dominica has just published a little book giving\r\nsome interesting information recently obtained about a curious natural\r\nphenomenon in Dominica, one of the Lesser Antilles.\r\n\r\nThis island is only 291 square miles in area. It was colonized by\r\nthe Spaniards in the seventeenth century and peopled later by French\r\nemigrants, who controlled the island uninterruptedly until the\r\neighteenth century, and its resources have since been exploited by\r\nEnglish and French; and yet its natural curiosity in the northern part\r\nof the island had never been seen or heard of until twenty-eight years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThis can be explained only by the fact that the neighborhood of\r\nthe boiling Lake of Dominica is difficult of access. The lake was\r\ndiscovered by an Englishman, Dr. Nichols, who organized an expedition\r\nto explore the unknown part of the island.\r\n\r\nOne day his little party were clambering up a mountain. They suddenly\r\ncame upon evidences of sulphur, and a moment later stood looking down\r\ninto a crater which was filled with boiling water.\r\n\r\nStifling vapors rose from the agitated surface, rumblings of thunder\r\ncame from the subterranean regions, and near the center of the little\r\nlake, where the water was most violently disturbed, the furious boiling\r\nlifted the surface ten or twelve feet above the general level. The lake\r\nwas constantly fed by several small brooks that poured from the heights\r\nabove the crater.\r\n\r\nMr. Sterns-Fadelle says that the lake is still boiling. It has been\r\nfound to be at an altitude of 2,490 meters above sea level. In form it\r\nis elliptical.\r\n\r\nWhen it is filled with water it is about 200 feet long and less than\r\n100 feet wide. Its depth is unknown. An attempt to touch bottom was\r\nmade thirty feet from the water edge, where, at a depth of 195 feet, no\r\nbottom was reported.\r\n\r\nThe water is not always in movement. At certain times the surface is\r\ncalm and glistens brilliantly under the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nAt other times it is violently agitated and boils away, exactly like\r\na big tea kettle. But, instead of the singing that accompanies the\r\nebullitions in the kettle, the boiling fluid in this cauldron is\r\naccompanied by the gruffest and most unpleasant detonations. Little\r\nwaves roll up on the narrow shelf of sandy beach, which is covered with\r\na scum of sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe boiling lake is the center of the present volcanic activity of\r\nGrande Souffrière, or Diabolin, a mountain covering an area of about\r\nfive square miles. The lake is one of the last vestiges of volcanic\r\nenergy left to the big mountain, which within the historical period has\r\nhad no great outbursts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE CICOTT’S SEVEN-YEAR RISE.\r\n\r\nINDIANA PHENOMENON REAPPEARS ON SCHEDULE TIME.\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 1.--With neither outlet nor inlet that is at any\r\ntime visible, Lake Cicott, a small body of water in Cass County, has\r\nnow reached a height which it attains every seven years, and hundreds\r\nof acres of fine corn land are covered by several feet of water. The\r\nrural mail route, which runs along the lake’s banks, has been abandoned\r\nby the carrier, for the water covers it to a depth of three feet and\r\nstretches beyond for several hundred yards.\r\n\r\nLake Cicott has been an interesting phenomenon to the people of\r\nnorthern Indiana for many years, but the secret of its rise and fall\r\nhas never been discovered. It is the only Lake in Cass County and is\r\nabout one mile wide and about one mile long. The water is clear and\r\ncold and perfectly fresh. Its most mysterious characteristic is the\r\nfact that it overflows its banks every seventh year. The farmers who\r\nown the land upon its banks have become so used to this that they never\r\nattempt to cultivate the land in the seventh year, but give it up\r\nwithout protest, as they know it is sure to be claimed by the waters.\r\n\r\nThe Pottawattomie Indians who inhabited what is now Cass and adjoining\r\ncounties were familiar with the characteristic of the lake. They\r\nbelieved that its bottom was inhabited by a powerful spirit, which at\r\nintervals of seven years caused the lake to overflow. They construed\r\nthis action as approval of the tribe by the spirit, and watched\r\nanxiously for the time to come, for they saw in the rising waters\r\na sure indication that they had done nothing to displease it. The\r\nearly white settlers became acquainted with the legend and the oldest\r\ninhabitant is not able to recall a time that the overflow did not take\r\nplace when expected.\r\n\r\nThe water has now reached its highest point, and will soon begin\r\nto recede and continue to do so till the old confines are reached.\r\nResidents of the locality say that the weather conditions have no\r\neffect upon the lake, for its rise in the seventh year takes place\r\nregardless of the fact of rain or drouth. Amos Jordan, a veteran of the\r\ncivil war, who lives on a bluff overlooking the lake, says the only\r\napparent difference between wet and dry seasons when the rise occurs\r\nis that the water appears to be colder in time of drouth. What is true\r\nof the rise of the waters is also true of their recession, for they\r\ngradually disappear regardless of the amount of rainfall in the county.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is explained on the theory that there is a subterranean\r\noutlet, which becomes closed in some way and is opened by the pressure\r\nof the water when the highest point is reached every seventh year; but\r\nthis is mere guesswork and nothing has ever been discovered to justify\r\nsuch a theory. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, which owns a number\r\nof ice-houses on the edge of the lake, made soundings at different\r\nplaces before the rise began, and found the greatest depth to be ninety\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHundreds more of such clippings have been preserved in a scrap book\r\ndescribing similar phenomena all over the Earth, all of which seem\r\nsolvable through claims herein set forth, in the combined influences\r\nof frictional and volcanic heat, and the occasional contact with\r\noutpouring streams from the _internal_ ocean of fresh water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.\r\n\r\n  Archaic or variant spelling has been retained.",
