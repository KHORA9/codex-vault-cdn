At that time the area, although so near\r\nto Cairo, was little known; the Rohlfs Expedition maps marked the\r\nregion as “unexplored,” and in fact with the exception of a\r\npublication by Schweinfurth, who had traversed the region from north\r\nto south, _via_ Qasr el Sagha and Gar el Gehannem to Rayan, there was\r\nlittle information obtainable. The area being of considerable size\r\n(12,000 sq. kilom.) and almost unexplored, both geologically and\r\ntopographically, the primary object was to construct as rapidly as\r\npossible a general map of the depression, at the same time laying down\r\nin broad outline the chief geological formations and trusting to future\r\nopportunity to examine in more detail places of special interest.\r\n\r\nCommencing work at Sêla, on the eastern side of the depression, the\r\nsurvey was carried northwards along the east side of the cultivated\r\nlands and thence through the northern desert, up to the summit\r\nof the depression. After mapping westwards as far as the isolated\r\nhill-mass of Gar el Gehannem the work was temporarily suspended until,\r\nin the spring, the narrow defile of Wadi Muêla, and the Wadi Rayan,\r\nforming the southern part of the Fayûm depression, were provisionally\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nIn January 1901, samples of soil and water from the cultivated lands\r\nwere collected as an experimental soil-survey, and the results have\r\nbeen published.[1]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter’s work of 1902-03 a traverse was carried from Gar\r\nel Gehannem in a south-west direction through a hitherto unexplored\r\npart of the depression. On reaching a point midway between Cairo\r\nand the oasis of Baharia a connection was made eastwards to Wadi\r\nRayan. In the winter of 1903-04 further exploration was carried out\r\nin the neighbourhood of Gar el Gehannem.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient here to briefly relate the history of the\r\ndiscovery of the remarkable series of new and extinct animal forms, the\r\nrecovery of which from the Fayûm deposits has created such widespread\r\ninterest in the zoological world. When Schweinfurth crossed the region\r\nin 1879 he obtained fossil bones, which were examined and determined\r\nby Dames to be the remains of cetacea of the genus _Zeuglodon_,\r\nfrom certain beds of the escarpment west of Qasr el Sagha; these,\r\nit is believed, were the earliest vertebrate remains obtained from\r\nthe Fayûm. During the early part of the survey of the district,\r\nremains of fish and crocodiles were frequently found in one of the\r\nbeds of the Middle Eocene, probably on the same horizon as that\r\nfrom which Schweinfurth had collected. Fragments of bone were also\r\ncommonly met with on a much higher horizon (_i.e._, near the base\r\nof the Fluvio-marine series) but nothing of particular interest\r\nwas obtained, as no detailed search could be made at that time. In\r\nApril 1901, during the survey of the western end of the Birket el\r\nQurûn, some of the localities found to be bone-bearing in 1898 were\r\nre-visited in company with Dr. C. W. Andrews, who was in Egypt at the\r\ntime and had accompanied the survey in order to obtain specimens of\r\njackals, hares, etc., for the British Museum, in connection with the\r\nforthcoming work on Egyptian mammals. In one of these Dr. Andrews\r\npicked up several vertebrae which turned out to belong to a new\r\nspecies of _Pterosphenus_.\r\n\r\nFurther north, when descending the Middle Eocene escarpments at a place\r\nnot previously examined, we crossed the outcrop of the bone-beds at a\r\npoint where a considerable number of mammalian and reptilian bones lay\r\nexposed on the surface, many in an excellent state of preservation. The\r\nimportance of the find was evident, and a short examination of the\r\nmaterial on the spot enabled Dr. Andrews to pronounce the discovery\r\nto be of the highest importance from a palaeontological point of view.\r\n\r\nSome three weeks’ work in the immediate neighbourhood resulted in\r\na very good collection of vertebrates from the Middle Eocene beds,\r\nincluding several new genera afterwards described[2] under the names of\r\n_Eosiren_, _Barytherium_, _Mœritherium_, _Gigantophis_, etc. Moreover,\r\na fossil tooth brought in by one of the camelmen from a point several\r\nkilometres to the north led to a careful examination of the lower beds\r\nof the overlying Upper Eocene formation, which resulted in obtaining\r\nwell-preserved remains belonging to a new genus, since described as\r\n_Palaeomastodon_. All the material so far obtained was taken home to\r\nbe worked up and determined at the British Museum and a preliminary\r\ndescription was published by Dr. Andrews in the Geological Magazine.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1901-02 the survey of the Fayûm was resumed\r\nwith the special intention of following up the highest beds,\r\nthose in which _Palaeomastodon_ had been found. Continued search\r\nwestwards eventually led to the discovery of the remains of a large\r\nand remarkable horned ungulate (_Arsinoitherium_), a preliminary\r\nnotice[3] of which was published in the spring of 1902. Shortly after,\r\nthe remains of several new smaller mammals and reptiles (_Phiomia_,\r\n_Saghatherium_), including the shell of a large land tortoise\r\n(_Testudo Ammon_), were obtained[4]. Further work in the winters\r\nof 1902-03-04 led to a great deal more material being obtained[5],\r\nmostly of course belonging to the same species, but including some\r\nnew genera _Geniohyus_, _Megalohyrax_, _Pterodon_.\r\n\r\nThe amount of palaeontological material is now so large that the\r\nEgyptian Government has arranged with the Trustees of the British\r\nMuseum for the publication of the whole in a monograph to be issued\r\nby the Trustees. The present report, therefore, deals only with the\r\ngeology and topography of the district.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.

Cultivation is necessarily strictly\r\nlimited to the area covered with alluvial soil. The latter, for the\r\nmost part identical in origin and composition with the river-alluvium\r\nof the Nile Valley, covers a leaf-shaped tract between the bounding\r\ndesert on the east side and the lake (the Birket el Qurûn) on\r\nthe north-west. The easterly and central part of the cultivated\r\narea forms a more or less level table-land, from which the ground\r\nslopes gently away, especially on the north side, where the slope is\r\ntowards the lake and very marked. The cultivated land of the Fayûm\r\nis directly connected with that of the Nile Valley by a narrow strip\r\nof low ground, a natural passage through the desert separating the\r\nNile Valley and the depression of the Fayûm. Through this gap runs\r\nthe natural canal known as the Bahr Yusef, which is practically the\r\nsole source of water in the Fayûm and irrigates the entire district.\r\n\r\nThe canal leaves the Nile Valley at Lahûn (Plate II), and follows a\r\nsomewhat serpentine course through the desert for about 5 kilometres,\r\nirrigating a narrow strip of land on either side, which at Hawara\r\nrapidly broadens out into the wide cultivated area of the Fayûm. Once\r\nwithin the latter, the Bahr Yusef gives off numerous subsidiary canals\r\nwhich traverse the country in all directions, constantly splitting up\r\ninto smaller branches until the water-supply is divided throughout the\r\nwhole area. With the exception of the self-contained basin of Gharaq,\r\non the south side of the Fayûm, the entire district drains into the\r\nBirket el Qurûn, which occupies the lowest part of the depression,\r\nto the north of the cultivation. The basin of Gharaq is irrigated by\r\nthe Bahr el Gharaq, a canal which takes off from the Bahr Yusef soon\r\nafter the latter enters the Fayûm[6].\r\n\r\nThe cultivated land of the Fayûm is traversed by two main ravines,\r\ncut down in many places to the Eocene limestone below the alluvium\r\n(Plates III and V.) At the present time these ravines carry canals\r\nfor irrigating the lower parts of the district, and also act largely\r\nas drains to the higher lands. They were probably initiated by the\r\nescape of water through breaches in the Bahr Yusef during flood time,\r\nand have since been deepened to their present dimensions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the main central cultivated area, the soil of which,\r\nas mentioned above, is essentially identical with that of the Nile\r\nValley, large tracts of the surrounding country, more especially on\r\nthe north, north-west, and west sides, are also covered with alluvial\r\ndeposits. These latter, which include sands, sandy clays, and clays\r\nof a quite distinct type, represent the slowly formed accumulations\r\nof the quieter and more remote parts of the ancient Lake Moeris (and\r\nthe earlier prehistoric lake). The material was mostly derived from\r\nthe Eocene strata which formed the shores of the lake, augmented no\r\ndoubt by a certain amount of very fine sediment drifted from the Bahr\r\nYusef, and by sand blown in by wind.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that the thickest and most sandy deposits occur near\r\nthe borders of the lake site; when close under the Eocene cliffs,\r\nas along the north side above the Birket el Qurûn, the deposits\r\nclosely resemble those of the latter. The finer more calcareous beds\r\noccur further out and the true marls were accumulated only at some\r\ndistance from the shores of the lake.\r\n\r\nWhen in Ptolemaic times the lake became reduced to a fraction of\r\nits former size, large areas covered by these lacustrine clays were\r\nexposed and some portions were brought under cultivation. Subsequently,\r\nhowever, all these outlying districts were abandoned and became\r\nabsorbed by the surrounding desert, until in modern times the\r\ncultivation was restricted to the central portion of the old lake\r\nbed, a portion almost identical with the area over which true “Nile\r\nMud” had been deposited.\r\n\r\nThe construction during recent years of extensive irrigation works\r\nin the Nile Valley has made it possible to largely augment the\r\nwater-supply of the Bahr Yusef to the Fayûm. High level canals are\r\nbeing cut in various parts of the district and already large areas of\r\ndesert covered by these lacustrine deposits have been brought under\r\ncultivation, notably to the north of Tamia and in the neighbourhood\r\nof Qasr Qurûn. The approximate area covered with lacustrine deposits\r\ncan be seen on the map and with a sufficiency of water probably the\r\ngreater part of this area could be utilized, though the exact value\r\nof the soil compared with Nile deposit remains to be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION II.—THE BIRKET EL QURUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lowest part of the depression, lying immediately to the north-west\r\nof the cultivation, is occupied by a sheet of water of considerable\r\nsize, known as the Birket el Qurûn.[7] The lake, which has a length of\r\n40 kilometres, and a maximum breadth under ten, covers at the present\r\ntime an area of about 225 square kilometres. Sir Hanbury Brown obtained\r\nno sounding exceeding 5 metres in crossing the lake to Dimê, but\r\naccording to the fishermen the depth increases towards the south-west.\r\n\r\nIts long axis lies nearly east and west, and while on the north it is\r\nentirely[8] bordered by desert, along a large part of the south side\r\nthe cultivated land approaches its shore, although even here a large\r\narea actually bordering the lake is waste salty land as yet unfit for\r\ncultivation. As already mentioned, with the exception of the Gharaq\r\nbasin, the lake receives the whole drainage from the cultivated lands.\r\n\r\nThe Birket el Qurûn is the existing remnant of the ancient prehistoric\r\nlake which covered a large part of the floor of the Fayûm depression,\r\nand which in historic times was converted into an artificially\r\ncontrolled sheet of water—the celebrated Moeris—by Amenemhat I\r\nand his successors in the XII Dynasty.\r\n\r\nLake Moeris, being used as a regulator of excessively high and low\r\nNile floods,[9] was of the greatest importance in connection with\r\nthe irrigation of the Nile Valley. In more recent times, apparently\r\nunder the Persians or Ptolemies according to Flinders Petrie,[10]\r\nLake Moeris ceased to perform its function of regulator; since that\r\ntime all water, except that required for irrigation of the reclaimed\r\nland, being carefully excluded, the surface of the lake has continually\r\nand gradually sunk to its modern dimensions.[11]\r\n\r\nLacustrine deposits, showing approximately the actual limits of the\r\nancient Fayûm lake, can be traced over wide areas of now barren\r\ndesert; these will be more fully dealt with later. The present\r\nlake-level is still continually sinking owing to an improved system\r\nof irrigation, by which a constantly decreasing amount of waste\r\nwater drains into the lake. Its average annual fall has, during the\r\nlast decade, been nearly half a metre,[12] and the slope of the land\r\nbeing very gradual, large areas have been reclaimed during the last\r\nfew years, though whether the advantages derived from this constant\r\nlowering of the lake are not more than balanced by certain drawbacks\r\nis somewhat doubtful.[13]\r\n\r\nWith the new areas now being brought under cultivation the amount\r\nof drainage water finding its way into the lake will increase and\r\nthe fall be checked. At the beginning of 1904 the level was markedly\r\nhigher than in the previous winter, and a difference of even half a\r\nmetre alters the shore line to a considerable extent, owing to the\r\nflatness of the land by which the lake is for the most part bounded.\r\n\r\nAlthough under the present desert conditions practically no material\r\nfrom the surrounding desert is washed into the lake, doubtless a\r\nconsiderable amount of fine dust and sand is carried into it by the\r\nwind, especially during the violent sandstorms which occur frequently\r\nin the locality. The high cliffs which bound the northern shore of\r\nthe lake throughout a portion of its length probably have the effect\r\nof checking the velocity of both north and south winds, thus causing a\r\nconsiderable amount of sand, which would otherwise be carried across,\r\nto be dropped on its surface. This material, together with the fine\r\nmud brought down by the canals on the cultivation sides, must have\r\nan appreciable effect in raising the level of the bed of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the extraordinary freshness of the water of the\r\nBirket el Qurûn has been commented on by Schweinfurth, who shows\r\nthat the degree of concentration of salt in a lake whose volume\r\nhas been continually reduced, and to which salt has constantly\r\nbeen added, should be many times greater than the actual existing\r\namount. An analysis[14] of the water at the west end of the lake\r\n(where the concentration is greatest, owing to the distance from the\r\nfeeder canals) showed that the total salts amounted to only 1·34%,\r\nof which 0·92% was sodium chloride. Dr. Schweinfurth[15] concludes\r\nthat the lake has a subterranean outlet, which alone would enable\r\nit to maintain its comparative freshness.[16] In this connection\r\nit is interesting to note the existence of distinct currents, which\r\nmay possibly be caused by such outlets, in certain localities on the\r\nnorth side of the lake; and it is just possible that a careful survey\r\nof the lake itself would not only prove the existence, but show the\r\nexact position, of such underground outlets.\r\n\r\nMost probably, however, the currents are simply local movements\r\nproduced by temporary differences of level, which might conceivably\r\nbe caused in such a large and comparatively shallow sheet of water,\r\nvarying considerably in salinity in different localities, by wind\r\nand evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe comparative freshness of the lake and the possible presence of\r\nunderground outlets are of the highest importance in their bearing\r\ndirectly on two of the most important questions in connection with the\r\nproposed utilization of the Wadi Rayan as a reservoir, i.e. what the\r\nleakage from such a reservoir would be and to what degree of salinity\r\nits water would attain.\r\n\r\n\r\n              SECTION III.—THE SURROUNDING DESERT REGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the lake and the cultivated area the depression\r\nis practically entirely desert. The southern and south-western parts\r\ninclude the wadies Rayan and Muêla, where freshwater springs occur,\r\nsurrounded by areas covered by a good deal of wild scrub. Apart from\r\nthese, however, no springs occur outside the cultivated land.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the region is so intimately connected with its\r\ngeological structure that an adequate description of the former is\r\nnot possible without constant reference to the latter. Full geological\r\ndetails will, however, be reserved for later consideration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Area and Limits.]\r\n\r\nThe part of the Libyan Desert dealt with in this report has, excluding\r\nthe cultivated land and the lake, an area of some ten thousand square\r\nkilometres. While some portions have been examined and mapped in\r\ndetail, others are still very imperfectly known, especially on the\r\nsouth and south-west sides. The irregular cliff-line forming the\r\nsouthern boundary of Rayan and the adjacent wadis may be taken as our\r\nlimit in this direction, beyond lying an almost unbroken limestone\r\nplateau rising gradually and continually to the south. On the north\r\nand north-west the area under description is bounded by the southern\r\nlimit of the great undulating high-lying gravelly desert-plateau which\r\nstretches with little change of character to the Mediterranean. On the\r\neast side the Nile Valley forms a convenient though not altogether\r\nnatural boundary; while to the south-west our limit practically\r\ncoincides with the boundary of the depression, where the floor of\r\nthe latter insensibly merges into the general desert plateau.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rocks forming the Area.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks forming the area within the above limits are almost entirely\r\nof sedimentary origin, the exception being a band of hard basalt\r\nintercalated at the very top of the series and exposed only on the\r\nextreme northernmost limit of the depression. The total thickness of\r\nsediments, from the lowest beds exposed in the bottom of the Wadi Rayan\r\nto the summit of the escarpments, a day’s march north of Tamia,\r\nis some 700 metres. These beds include every kind of sedimentary\r\ndeposit—limestones, marls, clays, sandstones, sands and gravels,\r\nforming an ever-changing succession of rocks, varying considerably in\r\nhardness and capacity for withstanding the agents of denudation. It is\r\nnot too much to say that the coming into existence of the Fayûm, with\r\nits plains, lowlying depressions, precipitous cliffs and escarpments,\r\nwas largely dependent on the existence of this variable series of\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nApart from the presence of sediments varying greatly in hardness\r\nand durability, the fact that the whole of the rocks have an almost\r\nconstant northerly dip of two or three degrees is a point of prime\r\nimportance. So small a dip may be scarcely noticeable in any one place,\r\nbut over the large areas with which we have to deal its influence\r\non the position and level of any individual bed is very marked and\r\nthe topography of the region would have been essentially different\r\nif the strata had been quite horizontal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of the Fayûm.]\r\n\r\nThe unique character of the Fayûm is alone sufficient to show\r\nthat special causes have acted in its production. Two main causes\r\nstand out:—(1) the presence of thick bands of comparatively\r\nsoft arenaceous and argillaceous strata breaking up the usually\r\ncontinuous hard limestone of the Middle Eocene; (2) the effect of\r\nthe Nile Valley fault in lowering the whole of the western desert\r\n(north of Assiut) relatively to the eastern. The former took place\r\nas the result of changed geographical conditions on the continent\r\nto the south at the time in question, with which however we need\r\nnot deal here. On a homogeneous mass of rock weathering has little\r\npower to form depressions of any magnitude, and this is the cause of\r\nthe continuous unbroken plateau which stretches southwards from the\r\nFayûm, the underlying rocks being one continuous thick mass of hard\r\nlimestone. Wherever softer intercalations are present differential\r\nweathering takes place, and all the great depressions of the Libyan\r\ndesert owe their origin to the presence of soft easily denuded strata;\r\nif the great homogeneous mass of Nile Valley limestone had stretched\r\nunchanged westwards, the oases of Farafra and Baharia would never\r\nhave existed. They owe their origin entirely to the presence of the\r\nunderlying saddle of softer Cretaceous rocks. Similarly if changed\r\nconditions had not led to the deposition of soft beds of clay, marl,\r\nand sandstone, the western plateau would have continued unbroken\r\nnorthwards.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the two sides of the Nile Valley between Cairo and\r\nAssiut shows that the tectonic movements, which largely determined the\r\nexistence of the valley itself, resulted in a considerable lowering\r\nof the rocks forming the western side. This was brought about by\r\ndifferential movements along the north and south line or lines\r\nof fault, and by the presence of an east to west monoclinal fold\r\nwhich is especially well marked in the neighbourhood of Heluan. The\r\ndepressions of the Fayûm would doubtless have existed irrespective of\r\nthis general lowering of the western desert relative to the east, but\r\ndenudation would have required an additional period of many thousands\r\nof years before the floor of the depression was low enough to allow\r\nof its actual connection with the Nile river.\r\n\r\nAs it has been maintained that the Fayûm is an area let down and\r\nenclosed by faults, it may be mentioned here that all available\r\nevidence points in an opposite direction; this question of faults\r\nwill however be dealt with in detail later. The influence of the Nile\r\nValley fault has been explained above and it must be remembered it\r\nis one affecting not the Fayûm alone but the northern part of the\r\nwestern desert as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor purposes of description it will be convenient to divide the whole\r\nregion into three parts: first, the southern portion, including the\r\nwadis Muêla and Rayan; secondly, the central area, comprising the\r\nextensive plain forming the floor of the depression as a whole, and\r\nincluding the areas under cultivation and the Birket el Qurûn, as well\r\nas the desert separating the Fayûm from the Nile Valley. Thirdly, the\r\nnorthern portion, embracing all the rising ground between the floor and\r\nthe northern rim of the region. These areas will now be taken in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SECTION IV.—WADI RAYAN AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis part of the Fayûm is of special interest in consequence of\r\nits possible future as a reservoir. Although the area has not yet\r\nbeen examined in detail by the Geological Survey it will be useful\r\nto bring together all the information that is at present available.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonel Western’s Survey.]\r\n\r\nIn 1882, as a counter-project to other irrigation schemes, Cope\r\nWhitehouse suggested[17] utilising as a reservoir the Wadi Rayan,\r\na depression which had been referred to by Linant de Bellefonds.[18]\r\nAt the request of Sir Colin Scott Moncrieff the Government deputed\r\nColonel Western to make plans of the Wadi Rayan and surrounding country\r\nand to ascertain the capacity of the depression and its capability\r\nof being used as a reservoir. Liernur Bey under his direction\r\nprepared a contoured map, and Colonel Western’s report, plans, and\r\nestimates were published.[19] Some general details of the wadi and\r\nsurrounding hills are given and the detailed survey showed that the\r\n30 metre contour line (above sea-level) enclosed an area of 706 square\r\nkilometres (170,000 feddans). The lowest points of the depression were\r\nfound at 42 metres below sea-level. The sand, scrub and springs are\r\nbriefly referred to and the discharge of the latter is given as equal\r\nto that of a very slow-going four inch hand pipe, the water running\r\nout at about + 20 m. and disappearing in the sand. Wadi Muêla was\r\nfound to be separated from the Rayan depression by sandhills and rock\r\nat a mean level of + 50 metres, the lowest point in Muêla being at +\r\n25 metres. A line of levels was run from Rayan through Muêla to the\r\nNile Valley, the highest point crossed being at + 105 metres; for\r\nfifteen kilometres the level was not below + 75 metres. In order to\r\nfind the most suitable passage for a canal to connect the Nile with\r\nthe Wadi Rayan two lines of level were made after a reconnaissance of\r\nthe hills near Sidmant el Jebel: the southern, from Ezba Menesi Ali,\r\nnear the Gharaq canal, to Mazana on the Bahr Yusef, being considered\r\nthe best. Along this line the highest point was only at + 44·7 metres\r\nand the average + 35 metres along four kilometres. Borings were not\r\nmade here but judging from the surface excavation would be mostly\r\nin soft limestone, sand, and conglomerate. A much shorter route is\r\nfrom Deshasleh on the Bahr Yusef over the hills about 5 kilometres\r\nto the south of Mazana or Sidmant into the Wadi Gharaq, a distance\r\nof 30 kilometres. This route was not however levelled but is fairly\r\nstraight and apparently not much higher than the Mazana passage.\r\n\r\nThe survey of the + 30 metre contour line of the Wadi Rayan proved\r\nthat there were only two outlets into the Fayûm, both on the northern\r\nside: these two openings are only from 400-500 metres wide and their\r\nlowest points are not below + 25 or + 26 metres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Later Government Publications by Scott Moncrieff and\r\nWillcocks.]\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Sir C. Scott Moncrieff published[20] a further note, in which\r\nhe briefly discussed the probable cost and benefits to be derived\r\nfrom the suggested reservoir, concluding that at least the project\r\nwas one worthy of being thoroughly examined.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the plans and designs in connection with the Wadi Rayan\r\nwere published[21] and the possibility of utilizing the Wadi Rayan\r\nwas examined by Sir William Willcocks, then Director General of\r\nReservoirs, from an engineering point of view, and the questions of\r\nits probable cost and future utility were discussed. In this report\r\nit is stated that the routes proposed by Colonel Western in 1888 pass\r\nthrough salty marls and clays unsuitable for holding canals. Another\r\nroute is suggested, which after leaving the Nile Valley crosses the\r\nhigh desert ridge in a straight line, passing through the so-called\r\nWadi Liernur (Wadi Lulu of Cope Whitehouse); this depression is 12\r\nkilometres long and has its bed some 24 metres below the general\r\nlevel of the desert. Plate 15 of the report shows the Wadi Rayan, the\r\ndeserts between it and the Nile Valley and the cultivated land. The\r\nmap was begun by Col. Western and completed by Willcocks. The lowest\r\npoint of Wadi Rayan is shown as − 42 metres and the depression is\r\nseparated from the Fayûm by a limestone ridge generally from + 34 to +\r\n60 metres, except at two places where it falls to + 26 metres above\r\nsea level on a length of 600 metres. Within the + 27 metre contour\r\nline the wadi has an area of 673 square kilometres and a capacity of\r\n18,743,000,000 cubic metres. Between it and the Nile Valley lie 30\r\nkilometres of desert, of which 11 are occupied by a marked depression\r\ndiscovered by Liernur Bey in 1887. At the extreme western edge of the\r\nNile Valley (here 20 kilometres wide) runs the Bahr Yusef. Comparing\r\nthe proposed Wadi Rayan reservoir and the ancient Mœris and allowing\r\nfor a difference of 4·5 metres between the levels of the Nile Valley\r\nin B.C. 2,000 and to-day, Willcocks assumes that the high water mark of\r\nLake Mœris was at + 22·5 metres and its area 2,500 square kilometres,\r\nagainst 673 square kilometres of the Wadi Rayan at + 27 metres. It\r\nis pointed out that the ancient lake had the great advantage that in\r\nthose days the Bahr Yusef was an important branch of the Nile, if not\r\nthe main river itself, and the reservoir was connected with the Nile\r\nby a natural ravine of great length and short breadth, across which\r\na massive embankment was thrown and destroyed annually, the surplus\r\nwater of high floods being stored for the deficiency of low floods.\r\n\r\nThe published sections along the lines of borings put down show the\r\ndifferent strata cut through by the proposed canal. The Nile Valley,\r\nalong the line of the inlet canal, consists of hard clay 6 to 10\r\nmetres thick, lying on coarse sand. Along the outlet canal sandy\r\nclays and clays alternate to a depth of 10 metres. On entering the\r\ndesert sands and sandy conglomerate, with gypsum and salt, are met\r\nwith below the surface, then a yellow marl with salts, and finally a\r\nplastic black clay overlying the Parisian limestone. These beds are\r\nmost extensive in the narrow neck of land between the Nile Valley and\r\nthe Fayûm and to some 10 kilometres to the south of it. They rise\r\nto + 70 metres. There are some other marls inside the Wadi Rayan or\r\nin the adjacent depressions and as they have to be traversed by the\r\ncanals form a serious factor, being easily dissolved in water; in\r\nconsequence Willcocks chose the alignment of the inlet canal along\r\nthe Bahr Belama where the extent of these beds would only be 2·5\r\nkilometres against 9 kilometres on the alternative route marked on\r\nthe plan. A narrow neck of land, some 15 kilometres in length, runs\r\nbetween the Fayûm and the depressions traversed by the proposed\r\nWadi Rayan canal; this neck is the continuation of the salty marls\r\nand clays, but the limestone is near the surface and is overlain by\r\na thin deposit of sand and pebbles, with freshwater shells on its\r\nnorthern slope at + 22·50 metres; the southern slope is entirely\r\ndevoid of them. Willcocks points out that it is evident the ancient\r\nMœris rose to + 22·50 metres but its water never penetrated into the\r\nWadi Rayan. The report goes into details of inlet and outlet canals,\r\ndischarge, necessary masonry works, cost, and compares the different\r\nreservoir schemes.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful review of the whole question, the scheme, while\r\nconsidered perfectly feasible as far as available data went, was\r\nabandoned by Sir William Garstin[22] in favour of the less costly\r\nand more useful Nubian reservoir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nEL WADI, RAVINE NEAR QASR GEBALI.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schweinfurth’s report on the probable salt-content in\r\nWadi Rayan Reservoir.]\r\n\r\nIn an appendix[23] to the above report Schweinfurth discusses the\r\nquestion as to how salt the water of such a reservoir would become. He\r\npoints out that the exact valuation of the salt which would be\r\ncontained in this reservoir when the water had risen to + 27 metres\r\ncannot be accurately determined, owing to the absence of information\r\non certain points. The maximum quantity of salt in the desert soil\r\nis estimated at 2% and this figure is used in his calculation,\r\nwhich includes the amount of salt which would be brought into the\r\nreservoir, (1) from the Nile during filling and in the extra water\r\nentering to replace that lost by evaporation in the lake and canals;\r\n(2) from the ground forming the bed of the lake (far the largest item);\r\n(3) from the bed and banks of the inlet canal, both in the desert and\r\nin the Nile Valley; and (4) from infiltration. The figure obtained\r\nis 7,500 million kilogrammes, equal to 0·04 per cent, or almost one\r\ntwenty-fifth per cent of salt. This amount is only equivalent to half\r\nthe salt existing in many of the well waters used in the country for\r\nirrigation. As Schweinfurth is careful to point out his calculation\r\nis based on maximum and assumed data.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Willcocks’ “Assouan Reservoir and Lake Mœris”.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the utilisation of the Wadi Rayan as a reservoir has\r\nrecently been again brought to the front, notably by Sir William\r\nWillcocks in a paper[24] read before the Khedivial Geographical\r\nSociety, Cairo. The author, after pointing out the value of such a\r\nlake, working in connection with the Assuan reservoir, discusses at\r\nlength the position, dimensions, and functions of the ancient Lake\r\nMoeris. It is suggested that the main canal should be cut through\r\nthe desert opposite Mazana and crossing the so-called wadis Liernur\r\nand Masaigega enter the Wadi Rayan at its easternmost point. These\r\nwadis would in time become covered with alluvium and be converted\r\ninto valuable cultivated land. After examining the big ravines of\r\nthe Fayûm, where similar beds are exposed, the author comes to the\r\nconclusion that the maintenance of canals in the saliferous marls,\r\nwhich form part of the desert through which the inlet canal would pass,\r\nwould offer no particular difficulties.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the questions of leakage into the Fayûm and of the\r\nwater of the lake eventually becoming salted, Sir William Willcocks\r\nsays, “When the old Lake Moeris, or the present Fayûm, was full\r\nof water and 63 metres higher than the bottom of the Wadi Rayan and\r\nremained so for thousands of years, there was no question of the waters\r\nhaving become salted or having escaped into the Wadi. The Wadi was\r\nas dry as it is to-day and the great inland sea was always fresh.”\r\nAs to the question of leakage into Gharaq the author considers that\r\nif water found its way into that depression it would be a distinct\r\nadvantage, as such water could be pumped into the Nezleh canal and\r\nutilized elsewhere; he maintains at the same time that no leakage\r\nwill take place. Incidentally it is mentioned that the Wadi Rayan is\r\nseparated from the Fayûm by a limestone ridge, a statement which,\r\nas will be shown later, requires modification.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wadi Rayan not yet examined in detail by the Geological\r\nSurvey of Egypt.]\r\n\r\nUntil a detailed geological examination of the Wadi Rayan and\r\nneighbourhood has been carried out it will not be possible to form\r\nreliable opinions on many of the questions raised in connection with\r\nthe prospective reservoir. The writer’s acquaintance with the area\r\nis limited to a traverse in 1899 from the Nile Valley through Wadi\r\nMuêla to Rayan and thence to Gharaq, and subsequently to a stay\r\nof a few days duration in the neighbourhood of the Rayan springs,\r\nafter mapping the extreme south-west of the Fayûm depression. While\r\nthe accompanying maps may be taken as representing fairly accurately\r\nthe bolder topography of the region, they do not replace the older\r\ncontoured maps of the floor of the depression and the country between\r\nit and the Nile Valley to the east, accompanying the report on\r\n“Perennial Irrigation and Flood Protection in Egypt.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following description of this part of the district is based on a\r\ntraverse from the Nile Valley through the wadis Muêla and Rayan to\r\nGharaq; the detailed geological sections measured and examined along\r\nthe line of route will be given later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Traverse from Nile Valley through Wadi Muêla to Rayan\r\nand Gharaq.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Warshat el Melh in Wadi Muêla.]\r\n\r\nBetween the village of El Gayat and the mouth of the Wadi Muêla\r\n(16 kilometres to the north-west) stretches a gradually rising\r\nundulating gypseous plain, superficially covered with loose sand and\r\nrounded pebbles of quartz and flint. In occasional small hills the\r\nwhite limestone which forms the underlying rock is visible. Near\r\nthe entrance to the wadi stands a somewhat prominent conical hill\r\ncomposed of hard whitish fossiliferous limestone passing down into\r\nmore sandy and clayey beds. The bottom of the wadi is cut out in soft\r\ngreen and brown clays, its surface being covered with blown sand,\r\nfragments of limestone, flints and gypsum. From the mouth of the wadi\r\nthe Nile Valley cliffs run north and south in a winding irregular\r\nmanner. On entering the valley several outstanding flat-topped\r\nlimestone capped hills are passed on the right hand; they are in\r\npart joined to the regular bounding cliff beyond; the eastern cliff\r\nis steep and well-marked, while that on the west only outcrops here\r\nand there, buried as it is in immense accumulations of blown sand,\r\nrising in places into definite dune-ridges. Wadi Muêla has a length\r\nof some 18 kilometres and lies nearly N.W. and S.E. The central part\r\nof its floor is a sandy scrub-covered area, the lowest points lying\r\nat about + 25 metres; just at the southern edge of the scrub stands\r\na small hill composed of hard shaly clays capped by white limestone,\r\nsurrounded by a saline, superficially dry. Holes dug in this are\r\nat once filled with excessively salt water, and by evaporation of\r\nthe brine in shallow troughs supplies of white fairly pure salt can\r\nbe obtained. The area is known as Warshat el Melh. Banks of reeds\r\nwere found growing on the north side of the saline, the surface of\r\nthe latter being here composed of a soft brown sandy salty deposit,\r\ncaking here and there into a hard earthy impure salt.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest spots the saline frequently consists of soft wet sludge;\r\nits area is about half a square kilometre but the depth of the deposit\r\nis unknown. In the middle of the scrub-covered area to the north lies\r\nAin Warshat el Melh, a pool of water, fairly fresh and drinkable,\r\nalthough ferruginous, measuring 10 by 5 metres in size and from 2\r\nto 2½ metres deep. The water evidently rises from a spring on the\r\nwest side, round which are fifty square metres of green rushes, with\r\nsome larger bushes. The ground around and above is very saliferous;\r\nbetween the spring and the ruins to the north the ground is sandy,\r\nwith many bushes and much scrub. This ground extends two kilometres\r\nto the west, whence it gradually passes up into great masses of drift\r\nsand; an occasional small outcrop of the top of the plateau above the\r\nsand is all that serves to locate the position of the buried cliff. On\r\nthe east side the sandy ground with scrub extends about a kilometre,\r\nbeyond which the plain gradually rises for another kilometre to the\r\nbase of the cliff beyond, which is fairly steep and well-marked,\r\nthough with an entire absence of indentations of any kind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Der el Galamûn.]\r\n\r\nClose to the north end of the valley, and about 33 kilometres from\r\nEl Gayat, lie the ruins known as Der el Galamûn bil Muêla. At\r\nthe time of our visit a new square stone building was in course of\r\nerection and five or six persons were inhabiting the place. There are\r\nseveral small palms scattered about to the south of the monastery and\r\nan excellent running spring of clear water five hundred paces to the\r\nsouth-west. A new well is being sunk within the premises. To the north\r\nof the monastery the eastern cliff takes a marked trend to the west\r\nfor some three kilometres, whence it resumes a northerly direction,\r\nalways maintaining its character of a steep well-marked escarpment\r\nrising some 100 metres above the floor of the wadi. At the corner\r\nof the cliffs the lowest bed exposed is a white limestone; this is\r\noverlain by gypseous clays passing up into sandy beds, the latter\r\nbeing surmounted by the white limestone capping the escarpment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wadi Rayan.]\r\n\r\nWe are here on the summit of the divide between Wadi Muêla and Wadi\r\nRayan, the height of the floor being about + 105 metres; to the north\r\nstretches a gradually widening bay descending to the lowest ground\r\nof the Rayan depression. Immense accumulations of sand almost block\r\nthe defile and stretch away to the east, and the hitherto well-marked\r\ncliff on that side bends back and is lost to view. On the other side\r\nhowever, the bounding wall gradually emerges from the dunes, getting\r\nmore distinct as it is followed northwards until it becomes quite\r\nclear of the sand. The first glimpse of this cliff is seen a couple of\r\nkilometres west of the pass in an outcropping headland, the next point\r\nvisible being some five kilometres further west. Between these portions\r\nof the cliff are one or two outliers, surrounded by quantities of blown\r\nsand. A depression known as Wadi Korif is reported to lie to the west,\r\nand much scrub and some water is said to exist there; such a wadi is\r\nmarked on Schweinfurth’s map but apparently has not been examined.\r\n\r\nContinuing in a N.N.W. direction high rather steep dunes occur\r\non either flank, running N.N.W. and S.S.E. Between the dunes is a\r\nfairly hard undulating sand-flat affording an easy route; further\r\non a narrow defile between the dunes leads down to the centre of\r\nthe depression. The main areas occupied by blown sand are shown in\r\nthe accompanying maps. The most interesting part of the depression\r\nis the bay lying to the south of the narrow well-marked promontory\r\njutting out from the southern plateau, a huge pointer, as it were,\r\nin the direction of Gharaq; this is the Cape Rayan of Schweinfurth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Springs in Wadi Rayan.]\r\n\r\nThe bay is on three sides completely enclosed by cliffs and its\r\nfloor is thickly covered by a luxurious growth of wild scrub—chiefly\r\ntamarisk and ghardag; numerous isolated palm trees occur, especially in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the water which exists at several points. There\r\nare three particularly good springs,[25] the positions of which are\r\nshown on the accompanying maps. According to Colonel Western’s\r\nsurvey the water emerges at about + 20 metres. In 1899 the water of\r\nthe northern spring was found to have a temperature of 26°C. On our\r\nlast visit we found an artificially constructed pool of two metres\r\ndiameter and a depth of 30 centimetres; on the west side of this\r\nwere two springs, marked by the motion of the grey sand rising and\r\nfalling in the vents, down which a stick could be easily pushed to\r\na depth of two metres. The output of these springs together amounted\r\nto six litres a minute; the water was quite clear and although soft\r\nand rather ferruginous not by any means unpalatable (see analyses\r\nbelow). The pool lies on an open bare sandy spot and is surrounded by\r\nscattered bushes, none of which however are within fifteen metres;\r\na sand dune lies 150 metres to the south-west, with bushes and\r\nseven or eight young palms. The southerly spring has an output of\r\n21 litres a minute, and its water does not differ essentially from\r\nthat of the northern spring. Rising at the foot of a palm tree it\r\nforms pools on either side; thence it flows a distance of 20 metres\r\ninto an artificially constructed shallow basin 2 to 3 metres across,\r\nfrom which it runs away down the slope and disappears after five or\r\nsix metres. The east spring, which is situated on the east side of\r\nthe dunes bounding the mouth of the bay, consists of a small hole cut\r\nout in soft sand. The water seemed good, although analysis shows the\r\nsalts content to be high; this spring does not run, but if emptied\r\nthe hole soon refills. The remains of old buildings occur near the\r\nwell, in the shape of loose roughly squared limestone blocks, broken\r\npottery, and remains of old walls; the latter are nearly level with\r\nthe ground and very thickly and solidly built.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the promontory lies the so-called Little Rayan. Here\r\nthere is a good deal of scrub, and water can be obtained on the lowest\r\nground at a few metres depth, although there do not appear to be any\r\nsurface springs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geology of Wadi Rayan in broad outline.]\r\n\r\nThe geological succession of beds exposed in the cliffs of the\r\npromontory is given later. Broadly speaking it consists of two\r\nthirty-metre bands of hard limestone separated by 68 metres of softer\r\nsandy and clayey beds. The lower of the limestone bands in places\r\nforms the floor of the depression but more frequently the latter\r\nis composed of the overlying sandy or clayey beds. The depression\r\nis bounded on the north side by the same succession, and, as far\r\nas could be judged from observations made on the traverse, the bed\r\nof limestone capping the ridge, and forming the plain stretching\r\naway to the Birket el Qurûn and to Gar el Gehannem, is identical\r\nwith that capping the cliffs to the south, i.e. is the uppermost of\r\nthe two thick limestone bands. At the two points more particularly\r\nnoticed, namely, the spurs projecting southwards into the depression,\r\n23 kilometres west and 18 kilometres W.S.W. of Gharaq basin, the\r\nsequence seemed to be the same as in the southern cliffs, although,\r\nowing to the northerly dip, the upper bed of limestone lies at a\r\nmuch lower level and the basal beds are not exposed at all. In both\r\nthese localities, however, some of the underlying clays were exposed,\r\nas well as on the lowest spots crossed between the most easterly spur\r\n(18 kilom. W.S.W. of Gharaq) and the extensive dunes lying immediately\r\nwest of Gharaq cultivation. These dunes, though of no height, have\r\nremarkably steep sides. In crossing Gharaq to the Fayûm cultivation\r\noccasional beds of yellow sandy limestone were noticed, but their\r\nhorizon was not determined. Numerous bored blocks, probably belonging\r\nto the marine Pliocene, were observed scattered about. Apparently\r\nthe uppermost thirty-metre band of limestone passes continuously\r\nnorthwards under the cultivated lands of Gharaq and the Fayûm;\r\nin the ravines of the latter this limestone is not observed, the\r\nsoft limestones exposed below the alluvial deposits almost certainly\r\nbelonging to the overlying Ravine beds. The country to the east of\r\nGharaq has not been geologically examined and the exact locality in\r\nwhich the thick bed of limestone dips underground and is overlain by\r\nthe succeeding beds is doubtful. Further north, in the desert ridge\r\neast of Qalamsha, we have observed the Birket el Qurûn beds and a\r\nsection measured at this point is given later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Ridge separating Wadi Rayan from Gharaq and\r\nthe Fayûm.]\r\n\r\nAs it appears to have been freely assumed that the ridge separating\r\nthe Rayan depression from the cultivated lands of Gharaq and the\r\nFayûm is formed throughout of solid limestone, it is important to\r\npoint out that, on our assumption of the identity of the beds of\r\nlimestone capping the cliffs to the south and the plain to the north\r\nof the Wadi Rayan, the dividing ridge would in part be formed of the\r\nunderlying arenaceous and argillaceous beds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of leakage through dividing ridge.]\r\n\r\nThe absence of Nile deposit and freshwater shells in the Wadi Rayan\r\nwill, when confirmed after a thorough examination of the area, afford\r\nthe strongest evidence that the depression was never directly flooded\r\nby Nile water. The fact that the dividing ridge is probably everywhere\r\nabove the highest level attained by Lake Mœris, and by the still more\r\nancient prehistoric lake, is almost sufficient in itself as a proof of\r\nthis. It does not however follow that there was not leakage through\r\nthe ridge into the Rayan basin, as such leakage might conceivably\r\nhave taken place to a considerable extent without the water ever\r\nhaving collected in sufficient quantities to form even moderate\r\nsized pools within the depression. The bottom of the depression is\r\nfor the most part covered with soft porous sandy deposits overlying\r\nthe Eocene bed-rock below, and at the present time the water of the\r\nRayan springs, though continually running, at once disappears from\r\nsight, drains down to the lowest parts of the depression and is then\r\ngradually lost by evaporation or underground leakage. In the lowest\r\nparts of the depression this water is, as already mentioned, met with\r\non digging to a very moderate depth.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the flanks of the ridge separating the Fayûm\r\nand Gharaq cultivated areas from Rayan might prove if such leakage\r\never took place. If such was the case the seepage was probably\r\nalong the line of junction of the limestone and underlying clayey\r\nor sandy beds. Even if it were proved that there never was leakage\r\nfrom Lake Mœris into Wadi Rayan, it would not be safe to assume\r\nthat the converse would not happen, as the dip of the beds is from\r\nsouth to north and this fact is one to be reckoned with. Judging from\r\nthe nature of the Eocene beds forming the Wadi Rayan, my opinion is\r\nthat leakage on a large scale would not take place, and that owing\r\nto the northerly dip any water that escaped from the reservoir would\r\npass indefinitely northwards and would not find its way through the\r\noverlying limestone to the surface either in Gharaq or the Fayûm\r\ncultivation. A detailed examination of the local geology would,\r\nhowever, be necessary to prove or disprove this. As to the question\r\nwhether the Wadi Rayan as a whole would hold water, as far as is known\r\nthere are no faults or other fissures of any magnitude through which\r\nthe water could escape. No doubt a good deal of water would be lost\r\nbefore the smaller joints and passages, which exist in all rocks,\r\nwere silted up. Schweinfurth supposes that the freshness of the\r\nBirket el Qurûn is due to the existence of subterranean outlets,\r\nand such might also be found to exist in the Wadi Rayan. In any case\r\nthe argillaceous deposits from such a lake would very soon form a\r\nbed to all intents and purposes impermeable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Degree of Salinity.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the extent of salinity of such a lake Dr. Schweinfurth’s\r\nfigures are of considerable interest and value, although based wholly\r\non assumed data. The greater part of the salt would be derived from\r\nthe rocks and soil forming the bed of the reservoir and only by\r\nextensive sample collecting and analysis can reliable figures be\r\nobtained. We believe that in the lowest parts of the basin the salt\r\ncontent of the ground would be found considerably in excess of the two\r\nper cent used by Schweinfurth in his calculation, although his total\r\nestimate would probably be found well within the mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SECTION V.—CENTRAL AREA OF THE REGION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Central Plain at the Fayûm Depression.]\r\n\r\nThe great central plain, forming the floor of the depression as a\r\nwhole, is composed of a hard bed of limestone some thirty metres\r\nthick. This limestone, forming the uppermost member of the Rayan\r\nseries, is, as already mentioned, almost certainly identical with\r\nthat capping the cliffs to the south of the depression, and in all\r\nprobability in the eastern extension of the plain under description\r\nunderlies the whole of the cultivated lands of Gharaq and the\r\nFayûm. The feature of the plain as a whole is its marked and\r\nconstant, though low, dip to the north; so that its surface, bared\r\nby denudation of the overlying soft limestones of the Ravine series,\r\nover a distance of some twenty kilometres, is a true dip-slope,\r\nat the base of which lies a strip of low-lying country extending\r\nfrom beyond Gar el Gehannem through the Birket el Qurûn to the Nile\r\nValley ridge east of Tamia. The central and lowest portion of this\r\nlow-lying area is occupied by the Birket el Qurûn, the bed of which\r\nlies fifty metres below sea level and is thus the lowest known spot in\r\nthe whole of the Libyan desert. Thirty kilometres south-west of the\r\nwestern end of the lake, at the base of the dip-slope of the central\r\nplain and immediately under the southern scarps of the great outlying\r\nhill-mass west of Gar el Gehannem, lies another low lying basin, which\r\nreceives the drainage from a considerable area of the plain to the\r\nsouth-west. The latter, consisting of the limestone above-mentioned,\r\nis here superficially covered by gravel, and its dark undulating\r\nsurface is scored by numerous shallow winding water-courses marked\r\nby an abundant growth of scrubby vegetation; some of the principal\r\nof these drain into the basin just mentioned and after heavy rainfall\r\nthe water collects and forms a pool 600 metres in length by 100 to 150\r\nmetres wide. The base of the basin, at about 80 metres above sea level,\r\nis marked by a level deposit of silt of considerable thickness, the\r\neast end of the site being surrounded by great numbers of luxuriantly\r\ngrowing tamarisks. Other similar basins exist on the plain to the\r\nsouth, and under an isolated hill five kilometres W.S.W. several full\r\ngrown acacias were noticed. On the low ground to the north-west of\r\nGar el Gehannem, and at several points between it and the head of\r\nthe Birket el Qurûn, similar silt covered areas exist, some being\r\nonly from 30 to 40 metres above sea level.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme south-west of the region the limestone forming the\r\ncentral plain is gradually overlain by the succeeding beds, so that the\r\nground rises imperceptibly to the level of the plateau separating the\r\ndepression from that of Baharia, distant some two days march. On the\r\neastern side, if the superficial alluvial deposits could be stripped\r\noff, the underlying surface of limestone, sloping from south to north,\r\nwould not differ materially from the plain further west, except that\r\nhere, at any rate north of Gharaq, the Rayan limestone is overlain\r\nby the basal beds of the Ravine series.\r\n\r\n\r\n      SECTION VI.—RIDGE SEPARATING THE NILE VALLEY AND THE FAYUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe desert ridge separating the Nile Valley from the Fayûm has, to\r\nthe north of the Bahr Yusef, an average width of some ten kilometres;\r\nfurther south it narrows, until due east of Gharaq the ridge is barely\r\n2½ kilometres wide. The highest points are situated to the east of\r\nSersena and Qalamsha respectively.\r\n\r\nIn both these localities the Eocene rocks, consisting of clays\r\nalternating with beds of calcareous sandstone and sandy limestone\r\n(pp. 39, 40) are overlain by thick deposits of conglomerate and\r\ngravel, attaining altitudes of over 100 metres above the cultivated\r\nland below. From these summits the slope is usually very gradual on\r\nthe Nile Valley side but much more rapid towards the Fayûm.\r\n\r\nThe ridge is cut down, however, to a comparatively low level in\r\nfour localities; to the north-east of Tamia; to the east of Sêla,\r\nwhere the railway crosses; between Lahûn and Hawara, where the Bahr\r\nYusef canal enters; and to the south of Qalamsha, where along the\r\nsite of the proposed Wadi Rayan canal the highest point is only some\r\n40 metres above the Gharaq basin and 27 metres above the adjoining\r\nNile Valley cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outline of earliest connection of Nile with Fayûm.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting problems connected with the Fayûm may\r\nbe briefly alluded to here—When did the waters of the Nile first\r\nobtain access to the depression?\r\n\r\nAs will be shown later the Fayûm was occupied by the sea in Pliocene\r\ntimes, when the great gravel accumulations and gypseous deposits were\r\nformed. Later the area became dry and denudation of the land surface\r\ncompleted the work of erosion already begun in earlier times.\r\n\r\nIn Pleistocene times drainage down the Nile Valley appears to have\r\nbecome definitely established and probably the river in the lower\r\npart of its course eventually washed up against and broke down the\r\nseparating barrier of gravel between the Fayûm and the Nile Valley,\r\nso that part of its waters obtained access to the depression, formed a\r\nlake on the lowest part, and gradually rose until the whole basin, up\r\nto the level of the channel connecting it with the Nile Valley, became\r\nfilled. Every year thousands of tons of sediment were carried in by\r\nthe floods and spread out on the floor in the shape of a fan. Probably\r\nlater, as the Nile level fell, the valley and the depression again\r\nbecame disconnected, until the more modern river, with its gradually\r\nrising bed, again attained the requisite altitude. In early historic\r\ntimes the alluvial deposits had probably silted up the lake in its\r\nsouthern central part, and when in the XIIth dynasty the district\r\nwas first taken in hand by Amenemhat I this part of it must have\r\nhad the character of a huge marsh, nearly surrounded by open water,\r\nrapidly deepening towards the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SECTION VII.—THE NORTHERN DESERT REGION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Plateau bounding the Fayûm depression to the north.]\r\n\r\nAll along the north-west and north sides the ground rises rapidly from\r\nthe base of the dip-slope of the plain in a series of escarpments to\r\nthe summit of the rim of the depression, averaging 340 metres above sea\r\nlevel. Northwards from the summit stretches a rolling pebbly desert,\r\nthe prevailing character of which is a dark brown, relieved by lighter\r\nbrown grey and yellow patches, and especially flecked by the light\r\nsandy slopes of the undulations. Although the latter seldom rise to\r\nany considerable height above the general level of the plain, from the\r\ntop of the most modest eminence an immense view in every direction can\r\nfrequently be obtained. The monotony of this desert is only relieved by\r\nthe occasional belts of sand, which although extremely narrow in width,\r\nrun for immense distances in almost absolutely straight lines, and in\r\na N.N.W.—S.S.E. direction. Although none of these dunes actually\r\nreach the rim of the escarpment we may mention here the beautiful\r\nGhart el Khanashat, an almost straight and apparently unbroken ridge\r\nof sand, extremely narrow but of great length. Near its southern\r\nextremity the width does not exceed 100 metres; the slopes on both\r\nsides are frequently as much as 30°. The commencement of the Ghart\r\nel Khanashat was observed on a march from Wadi Natrûn to Mogara; it\r\nlay some way to the south of a line joining those two localities but\r\ncould not be accurately fixed from the line of route. The belt dies out\r\n24 kilometres from the rim of the Fayûm depression, its termination\r\nbeing particularly abrupt, although the height of the ridge diminishes\r\ngradually throughout the last kilometre or two. The line of the belt if\r\ncontinued would almost strike the western extremity of the Birket el\r\nQurûn; near its termination the desert is almost flat, the surface\r\nbeing finely gravelly, with numerous groups of silicified trees;\r\ntufts of coarse grass grow in some profusion on the sandy ground at\r\nthe base of the ridge on either side. A fairly well-marked road from\r\nthe Birket el Qurûn to the Wadi Natrûn passes the end of the ridge\r\nand continues northwards at a distance of 200 metres from the east\r\nside of the dunes, although apparently gradually diverging eastwards.\r\n\r\nExcept to the north and north-west of Tamia, where a somewhat extensive\r\nand fairly level plain exists, the ground, as already mentioned, rises\r\nfrom the limits of the central plain in a series of escarpments to the\r\nsummit of the rim of the depression. These cliff lines are broadly\r\nspeaking three in number and represent the escarpments of the three\r\ngreat rock-stages which build up the northern part of the Fayûm,\r\ni.e., the Birket el Qurûn series, the Qasr el Sagha series, and the\r\nFluvio-marine series. It would serve no useful purpose describing\r\nthese different cliffs in detail; their positions and characters are\r\napparent on the accompanying maps. The intervening plateaux are for\r\nthe most part dip-slope plains formed of hard bands of rock, which\r\nresisting denudation, are left protecting the underlying strata while\r\nthe softer beds above are cut back at a comparatively rapid rate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desert west and south-west of Gar el Gehannem.]\r\n\r\nIn December 1902 and March 1903 a traverse was made through the\r\nunexplored country west and south-west of Gar el Gehannem, finally\r\nconnecting up with Wadi Rayan. The highest escarpment, i.e. that of\r\nthe Fluvio-marine series, dies out about 20 kilometres west of Gar\r\nel Gehannem, gradually merging into the undulating gravel-covered\r\nplain. The lower escarpments, those of the Qasr el Sagha and Birket el\r\nQurûn series, continue to a considerable distance in a south-westerly\r\ndirection, although gradually losing the characters of well-marked\r\ncliffs. In fact westwards of this the depression gradually shallows,\r\nuntil at a point some 50 kilometres south-west of Gar el Gehannem\r\nthe floor has attained the level of the ordinary desert plateau,\r\non which the outcrops of the beds of successive rock-stages follow\r\none another in regular order from south to north, but without forming\r\nwell-marked topographical features, as in the depression.\r\n\r\nHills, capped with dark hard ferruginous silicified grits and\r\npuddingstone, were met with in the extreme south-west extension of the\r\ndepression; these deposits, which will be referred to more fully later,\r\nconsidered in conjunction with the similar beds occurring within the\r\noasis of Baharia, and in the hills of Gar el Hamra, on the plateau\r\nimmediately to the north-east of that depression, are of considerable\r\ninterest and importance, especially in connection with the question\r\nof the position of the early rivers which in Eocene and later times\r\nbrought down quantities of trees and animals, the remains of which\r\nare so abundant throughout the later Fayûm deposits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jebel el Qatrani and escarpments north of the Birket\r\nel Qurûn.]\r\n\r\nThe boldest part of the region is the area lying between the Birket el\r\nQurûn and the summit of the depression to the north. All three lines\r\nof cliff are here high and precipitous, and the uppermost escarpment,\r\nwell known by the name of Jebel el Qatrani, formed of a highly coloured\r\nseries of sandstones and clays and capped for a distance of many\r\nkilometres by a thick bed of hard black basalt, is of a most striking\r\ncharacter. The eastern extremity of Jebel el Qatrani is perhaps the\r\nmost conspicuous point in the whole region; here the two conical black\r\nbasalt-capped cliff-outliers, known as Widan el Faras, stand side by\r\nside, and from their summits the eye commands the whole region from\r\nthe pyramid of Lahûn on the one side, across Rayan to the south, up\r\nto the extreme limits of the depression to the south-west. The rim of\r\nJebel el Qatrani has a fairly constant level of about 340 metres above\r\nthe sea. From Widan el Faras the escarpment trends northwards for a\r\nfew kilometres before again resuming an easterly direction, which is\r\ncontinued till the well-marked bluff of Elwat Hialla is reached. From\r\nthis summit the pyramids of Dashûr, Saqâra and Giza are visible to\r\nthe north, as well as Cairo and the Nile Valley southwards, backed\r\nby the bluffs on the Eastern desert limestone plateau.\r\n\r\nTo the south the isolated peaks of Garat el Gindi and Garat el\r\nFaras form conspicuous landmarks on the more or less open plain\r\nwhich stretches to Tamia and the limits of the Fayûm cultivated\r\nlands. Eastwards the escarpments continue in a broken irregular\r\nmanner; the upper ones are gradually lost in an undulating plain,\r\nwhile the lower eventually join those forming the northern part of\r\nthe ridge separating the Fayûm from the Nile Valley.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: For fuller details of the cultivated lands, water-supply,\r\netc., of the Fayûm, the reader is referred to the excellent description\r\nby Sir Hanbury Brown in his work _The Fayum and Lake Moeris_, London,\r\n1892.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: “The Lake of the Horns,” so called from the narrow\r\nhorn-like promontories which jut out into the lake on the north\r\nside.

No evidence has as yet\r\nbeen met with which would suggest that earth-movements have played\r\nany important part in the formation of the Fayûm depression. Local\r\nfaults, for the most part of short length and slight throw, occur\r\nat certain points, but the influence of these is strictly limited to\r\ntheir immediate neighbourhood. In fact, an examination of the desert\r\nmargin of the Fayûm conclusively proves that the depression has been\r\ncut out through the action of ordinary subaerial denuding agents. The\r\nsomewhat prevalent idea that the central portion of the depression,\r\nthat covered by alluvial soil and the water of the lake, is faulted\r\ndown, also rests on no foundation, all available evidence pointing\r\nin an opposite direction. Throughout the margin of the alluvial\r\ncovered area the Eocene beds forming the surface of the desert can\r\nbe observed to pass regularly under the cultivated lands; moreover,\r\nthe same strata are frequently exposed in the bottoms of canals,\r\ndrains, etc., far within the cultivation. The big drainage ravines\r\nof El Bats and El Wadi are, through a large part of their courses,\r\ncut down to the underlying Eocene rocks (Ravine beds), and in every\r\nlocality examined the strata were found in the position they would\r\nbe expected to occupy if undisturbed by tectonic movements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deep boring at Medinet el Fayûm.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence yielded by the deep boring at Medinet el Fayûm is,\r\nas far as it goes, to the same effect. The ground level at the site\r\nwas at 23·40 metres above sea-level and the following beds were\r\npassed through[28]:—\r\n\r\n                                                                 Metres.\r\n\r\n  Alluvial clays, clayey sands and sands, the latter in\r\n  part coarse and pebbly                                            18·5\r\n\r\n  Yellow, brown, and grey marls and marly clays (probably\r\n  belonging for the most part to the Ravine beds)                  112·5\r\n\r\n  Cement coloured stone         }                                   43·5\r\n                                }\r\n  Yellowish stone               }    Probably these                  6·5\r\n                                }    limestones and\r\n  Light brown solid stone       }    occasional marls               10·5\r\n                                }    and clays belong\r\n  Cement coloured soft clay     }    to the Rayan series.            1·7\r\n                                }\r\n  Cement coloured stone         }                                   12·5\r\n                                                                   -----\r\n                                                                   205·7\r\n                                                                   -----\r\n                          Bottom of boring 182·3 metres below sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe method employed in this boring was such as to bring up the\r\nmaterial as a ground-up paste, an examination of which does not afford\r\nabsolutely conclusive evidence as to the age of the rock. The absence,\r\nafter the first 18·5 metres, of sand or pebbles, common throughout\r\nthe alluvial deposits of the Fayûm, suggests that the base of these\r\nbeds was reached at that depth, but from this evidence alone it would\r\nperhaps hardly be satisfactory to conclude that the underlying 112·5\r\nmetres were entirely Eocene. Considering, however that in the two deep\r\nravines of El Bats and El Wadi the underlying Eocene is very commonly\r\nexposed at an average depth of some 15 metres below cultivation level,\r\nit is highly improbable that in the centre of the area, at Medinet el\r\nFayûm, the alluvial deposits greatly exceed the same thickness. To\r\nclassify the 112·5 metres of marly clays as alluvium would give\r\nthe latter a total thickness of 131 metres and would mean that over\r\nan extremely restricted area the Eocene rocks had been denuded to\r\nsuch an extent that the floor of the depression lay 108 metres below\r\nsea-level. The ground-up samples of rock closely resemble what might\r\nbe expected from the clays and marls forming the Ravine beds and\r\nin all probability the greater part of the 112·5 metres belong to\r\nthat series. The harder stone met with at 131 metres, which, with\r\nthe exception of a band of soft clay, continued down to the bottom,\r\nmust be regarded as belonging to the underlying Rayan series.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Blanckenhorn’s Fault theory.]\r\n\r\nDr. Blanckenhorn, in a paper published in 1901[29] dealing with\r\nthe Pliocene and Pleistocene of Egypt, describes the Fayûm as a\r\ntriangular depression bounded on all sides by faults. The position\r\nof these bounding faults, as well as of numerous others more or less\r\nparallel to the north shore of the Birket el Qurûn, is shown on an\r\naccompanying map[30] and in a section drawn from Abshawai to the summit\r\nof the plateau north of the lake.[31] Stratigraphical evidence, based\r\non the supposed identity of certain strata in different localities,\r\nis brought forward in support of these faults, the author finally\r\nstating that the production of the Fayûm is clearly and distinctly\r\nto be referred to tectonic movements.\r\n\r\nOur conclusion, formed after an examination of the region in some\r\ndetail, is so diametrically opposed to the above, that it may be worth\r\nwhile to state here the evidence which we consider sufficient to refute\r\nthe existence of the particular faults described by Blanckenhorn.\r\n\r\nBlanckenhorn’s fault-lines lie for the most part within the area\r\ncovered by the alluvial deposits and the water of the lake, so that for\r\nwant of exposures it is in most cases impossible to directly disprove\r\ntheir existence, although strong presumptive evidence against them can\r\nbe adduced. The fault along the east side, however, is shown as closely\r\nfollowing the junction line of the desert and the cultivated land,\r\nbut everywhere along this line we found the marls and limestones\r\nof the Ravine beds passing regularly from the desert under the\r\ncultivated lands, without any sort of break or dislocation. Moreover,\r\nan examination of the desert ridge to the east disproved the existence\r\nof any faulting on the desert side, while the appearance of the\r\nsame beds in the ravine of El Bats, a few kilometres to the west,\r\nproved the continuity of the beds under the cultivated alluvium in\r\nthis direction. Certainly no fault exists along this side of the\r\nFayûm. Similarly with regard to the fault shown as running from the\r\nwest end of the lake along the west side of the Fayûm cultivation\r\ninto the basin of Gharaq; although the desert margin along this side\r\nof the Fayûm cultivation has not been so closely surveyed as that on\r\nthe east side, no evidence in favour of the existence of faults was met\r\nwith in the particular localities examined. With regard to the third\r\nmain bounding fault, considered by Blanckenhorn to run throughout\r\nthe length of the Birket el Qurûn and to be continued eastwards,\r\npossibly to the Nile Valley and at least to join the fault on the east\r\nside of the cultivation, we need only say that an examination of the\r\ndesert near Tamia disproves its existence at that end; while it is\r\ndifficult to imagine that a fault could traverse the lake from end\r\nto end without revealing its presence in the island Geziret el Qorn\r\nor in one or other of the promontories which jut out so far into the\r\nlake from its northern shore. Everywhere the strata are undisturbed\r\nand occupy their normal stratigraphical level and position.\r\n\r\nLet us finally examine the series of more or less parallel faults\r\nstated to exist between the island and the northern shore of the lake,\r\nand on the mainland to the north and south of Dimê. Dr. Blanckenhorn\r\npublishes a detailed section (op. cit., fig. 2., taf. XIV) showing\r\nthe positions of these step faults and their effect on the various\r\nstrata through which they cut. Fortunately, in this neighbourhood the\r\nstratigraphical succession is well exposed and the presence or absence\r\nof faults become matters of easy determination. The sequence of beds\r\nfrom south to north is normal and uninterrupted and our interpretation\r\nof the area is shown in the accompanying sections (Plates XIX, XXII,\r\nand fig. 4). We have no hesitation in saying that such faults as\r\nthose shown on Blanckenhorn’s section do not exist. Their insertion\r\nappears to be the outcome of an error in the correlation of strata at\r\nthe three points Abshawai, Geziret el Qorn and Dimê. The bed capping\r\nthe island is not identical with that forming the plain to the north\r\nof Dimê, although shown to be such on the section under discussion.\r\n\r\nIn a later publication[32] Blanckenhorn admits being in error in\r\nhis correlation of the different beds in the localities in question\r\nand completely withdraws his former statements that the depression\r\nowes its existence to fracture and subsidence. The faults shown on\r\nhis detailed section from Abshawai to Qasr el Sagha are admitted to\r\nbe non-existent and in this retraction we may presumably include the\r\nremainder of the faults described by the same author, as the evidence\r\nfor them is of a still less satisfactory nature.\r\n\r\nIn a wind-swept desert area like the Fayûm the slightest dislocations\r\nare as a rule markedly obvious, and faults of any magnitude could\r\nscarcely escape detection. Over the greater part of the region\r\nevery bed is laid bare on the surface and can be minutely examined;\r\nwhile the marked irregularity of the escarpments afford sections cut\r\nthrough the different series in every direction. Some areas, however,\r\nare covered with superficial deposits, which more or less effectually\r\nobscure the underlying rocks; for instance, on the east side a large\r\npart of the central floor is hidden by the cultivated alluvium and\r\nby the water of the lake; in the south a considerable proportion of\r\nthe floor of Wadi Rayan is buried under accumulations of blown sand;\r\nand again large areas on the north, west, and south-west sides are\r\nobscured by a superficial covering of loose gravel. But as already\r\nmentioned, there is no reason to suppose that faults of any importance\r\nexist within the areas thus partly obscured. The cultivated lands and\r\nthe Birket el Qurûn do not occupy low areas produced by faulting but,\r\nas shown above, owe their positions entirely to the original northerly\r\ndip of the strata and to subsequent erosion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Numerous small faults effects local.]\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that small local faults occur in various parts\r\nof the Fayûm and some of these may be specially mentioned. The most\r\nimportant is about 10 kilometres N.N.E. of Qasr el Sagha; the line\r\nof fault lies nearly north-west and south-east, has a length of six\r\nor seven kilometres, and affects both middle and upper Eocene beds;\r\nat its northern end the fault passes into a fold before finally dying\r\nout. Some of the Upper Eocene sandstones are hardened and silicified\r\nand form a succession of black knobs along the line of disturbance. To\r\nthe south of these the axis of dislocation bends slightly eastwards and\r\ntakes the form of a sharp fold; further south it again becomes a true\r\nfault, flanked by a line of highly tilted beds along its south-west\r\nside. The effects of this fault are very marked locally but entirely\r\nrestricted to a limited area. The most important is the breaking of\r\nthe continuity of the escarpment of the Qasr el Sagha series; the\r\nline of cliffs formed by those beds is a very marked topographical\r\nfeature and the fault in question causes a lateral displacement of\r\nseven kilometres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Fault near Qasr el Sagha.]\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Qasr el Sagha and westwards for a considerable\r\ndistance, small strike-faults are of common occurrence in the beds\r\nof the Qasr el Sagha series. As a rule these faults do not extend\r\nmore than a few hundred metres in length, while the down-throw seldom\r\nexceeds two or three metres and in almost every case observed is to the\r\nnorth. The hade may be 65° or more. Fig. 1 shows an example near Qasr\r\nel Sagha. The most marked of these strike faults is seen to the east\r\nof Garat el Esh; commencing a little to the north-east of that hill\r\nit runs in a nearly due easterly direction till it cuts the cliffs of\r\nthe Qasr el Sagha series after some five kilometres. Its down-throw\r\nis to the north and never exceeds a few metres; this small throw\r\nis however sufficient to cause a marked displacement of the highest\r\nbed of limestone forming the dip-slope surface of the plateau at the\r\nsummit of the Middle Eocene beds.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it might be suspected that the very irregular trend\r\nof the different escarpments throughout the Fayûm was determined\r\nor influenced by fault lines; an extended examination of the cliffs\r\nhowever gave negative results, with one exception; the long narrow\r\nhill-mass to the north east of Gar el Gahannem is bounded by faults\r\non both sides and that on the west can be easily traced for seven or\r\neight kilometres northwards, and throughout its length its influence\r\non the topography is very conspicuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: BEADNELL. _The Fayûm depression: A Preliminary Notice\r\nof the Geology of a District in Egypt containing a new Palaeogene\r\nVertebrate Fauna_.

The sedimentary rocks of the district have yielded an abundant\r\nfauna, both invertebrate and vertebrate; the latter is of unique\r\ninterest, including as it does a number of highly interesting animal\r\ntypes quite new to science. An extended examination in the field,\r\nand comparisons with the stratigraphical succession in other parts of\r\nEgypt, checked by the determinations of the fossil molluscan fauna,\r\nmake it possible to form a very fair estimate of the approximate\r\nage of the different rock-stages, although this may necessarily\r\nbe subject to modification when the specific determinations of the\r\nentire collection of organic remains have been completed, and the\r\ndevelopment of vertebrate life has been correlated and compared with\r\nthat in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe depression is cut out in a great series of sedimentary rocks of\r\nMiddle Eocene, Upper Eocene, and Oligocene age, and one of the features\r\nof the stratigraphy of the region is the constancy of many beds over\r\nwide areas. The dip of the beds throughout the area is nearly due north\r\nand at a very low angle, averaging 2° or 3°, but varying from 1° to\r\n5°; this low dip is very constantly maintained except when locally\r\naffected by small faults. The structural geology and tectonics have\r\nalready been discussed at some length in the previous sections.\r\n\r\nThe oldest beds found in the depression are the clays, marls, and\r\nlimestones with _Nummulites gizehensis_, of Middle Eocene age. These\r\nare succeeded by a group of white marly limestones and gypseous clays,\r\nwhich largely underlie the cultivated alluvium of the Fayûm. They are\r\nfollowed by a series consisting of clays, sandstones, and calcareous\r\ngrits, some beds of which are characterized by the abundance of small\r\nnummulites and _Operculina_. The latter series is followed by the\r\nuppermost truly marine Eocene beds, a group of alternating clays,\r\nsandstones and limestones, the “Qasr el Sagha Series” (or Carolia\r\nbeds), characterized by an abundant invertebrate and vertebrate fauna,\r\nand equivalent to the Upper Mokattam beds of Cairo.\r\n\r\nAbove the Qasr el Sagha series, and well marked off from them both\r\nlithologically and palæontologically, is found a great thickness of\r\nvariegated sands, sandstones, clays and marls, the “Fluvio-marine\r\nSeries” (Jebel el Qatrani beds), divided near the summit by\r\none or more thick intercalated lava sheets, the latter forming a\r\nconvenient junction line. This series of variegated beds is of Upper\r\nEocene—Lower Oligocene age.\r\n\r\nNo Miocene strata have been recognized within the area, but further\r\nnorth, as at Mogara, Lower Miocene deposits occur;[34] and it is\r\nprobable that there is a continuous series of lithologically similar\r\nbeds from the summit of the Fayûm escarpments (Lower Oligocene)\r\nto the Mogara Miocene.\r\n\r\nThe Pliocene is probably represented by the great terraces of\r\ngravel—raised beaches—which are such a marked feature in the\r\ngeology of the district. Fossiliferous Pliocene deposits have also\r\nbeen recorded from the south part of the area by Schweinfurth.[35]\r\n\r\nPleistocene and Recent are abundantly represented by lacustrine clays,\r\nboth ancient and modern, alluvial land and blown sand, the formation\r\nof which deposits is continuing at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show the sequence of strata and the\r\nclassification adopted in the present memoir:—\r\n\r\n  TABLE SHOWING SUCCESSION AND CLASSIFICATION OF STRATA IN THE FAYUM.\r\n\r\n  -----------+---------+--------+-----------+---------------------------\r\n             |         |        |Approximate|\r\n             |         |        |  average  |\r\n             |         |        | thickness |\r\n             |         |        | in metres,|\r\n             |         |        | north part|\r\n             |         |        | of Fayum. |\r\n             |         |        +-----------|\r\n             |         |        |           |  Alluvial soil, clays,\r\n             |         |        |           |  sands, etc.\r\n    RECENT   |         |        |           |\r\n     AND     |         |        |           |  Blown sand.\r\n  PLEISTOCENE|         |        |           |\r\n             |         |        |           |  Lacustrine clays,\r\n             |         |        |           |  extending to about 23\r\n             |         |        |           |  metres above sea-level.\r\n  -----------+---------+--------+-----------+---------------------------\r\n             |         |        |           |  Gravel Terraces (?\r\n             |         |        |           |  Pleistocene).\r\n             |         |        |           |\r\n   (MIDDLE?) |         |        |           |  Shell-borings on rock\r\n   PLIOCENE  |         |        |           |  surfaces.\r\n             |         |        |           |\r\n             |         |        |     50    |  Fossiliferous deposits of\r\n             |         |        |           |  Sidmant.\r\n  -----------+---------+--------+-----------+---------------------------\r\n             |         |        |           |_Fluvio-marine Series\r\n             |         |        |           |(Jebel el Qatrani beds)_.\r\n             |         |        |           |\r\n     LOWER   |         |        |     30    |  Sandstones and\r\n   OLIGOCENE |TONGRIAN |        |           |  sandstone-grits with\r\n             |         |        |           |  silicified trees and\r\n             |         |        |           |\r\n             |         |        |           |  Basalt sheets,\r\n             |         |        |           |  interbedded and\r\n             |         |        |           |  contemporaneous.\r\n  -----------+---------+--------+-----------+- - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n             |         |        |           |  Variegated sands,\r\n             |         |        |           |  sandstones, clays and\r\n             |         |        |           |  marls, with\r\n             |         |        |           |  limestone-grits and thin\r\n             |         |        |           |  bands of limestone.

Schweinfurth, I.b. Mayer-Eymar,[36] Lower Mokattam of Cairo).\r\n\r\n\r\nBeds of this group are chiefly found in the south of the\r\ndepression. The wadis Rayan and Muêla, as already shown by\r\nSchweinfurth and Mayer-Eymar[37], are cut out in clays and limestones\r\nof Lower Mokattam age; the upper beds of limestone, containing\r\namong other fossil[38] numerous examples of the large _Nummulites\r\ngizehensis_, form the greater part of the floor of the depression\r\nwest of the Fayûm cultivation, stretching from Jebel Rayan to the\r\nfoot of Gar el Gehannem,[39] 28 kilometres west of the western end\r\nof the Birket el Qurûn (Section XX). Near the latter hill examples\r\nof _N. gizehensis_ of inordinately large size occur.[40]\r\n\r\nAt the conical hill at the southern entrance to Wadi Muêla the\r\nfollowing beds were noticed:—\r\n\r\n  _Top of hill._\r\n\r\n  1. Hard white limestone with small nummulites, _Lucina_,\r\n     _Callianassa_, and echinids. Salt occurs in thin deposits along\r\n     joint-planes. The lower part of this bed is largely composed of\r\n     small nummulites and bryozoa. This generally white limestone\r\n     passes down into\r\n\r\n  2. Brown, usually sandy, limestone with oysters and small nummulites.\r\n     In it are intercalated thin beds of greenish brown sandstone and\r\n     clayey sand with impressions of bryozoa. Some of the brown sandy\r\n     limestones are full of small nummulites. _Ostrea_ and _Carolia_\r\n     numerous. The beds are not constant, the clayey sandstones passing\r\n     insensibly into sandy limestones.\r\n\r\n  3. Softer beds with large nummulites, corals, _Ostrea_, _Nautilus_.\r\n\r\n  4. Soft green and brown clays, with occasional oyster-beds.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the cliff 7½ kilometres N.N.W. of the monastery of\r\nDer el Galamûn, in Wadi Muêla, occur about 80 metres of hard white\r\nnummulitic limestones, with beds of argillaceous sandstone and sandy\r\nclays. Fossils are numerous and include nummulites of several species\r\n(_N. gizehensis_, etc.), _Carolia placunoides_, different species\r\nof _Ostrea_, with gastropods (among others _Terebellum sopitum_),\r\nbryozoa, etc. It is very noticeable that the nummulites, especially\r\nthe small species, occur in remarkable profusion not only in the\r\nlimestones but often in the clays.\r\n\r\nThe following section will give a good idea of the general alternations\r\nfound in this area; it was measured at Jebel Rayan,[41] 24 kilometres\r\nwest of the western end of the cultivation of Gharaq basin.\r\n\r\n  _Top of plateau._                                              Metres.\r\n\r\n  1.

Vertical-faced bed of greenish clayey sands and sandy\r\n     clays (glauconitic) with _Carolia_, _Ostrea_ and\r\n     _Nummulites_. Near top of bed there is much gypsum. The\r\n     nummulites in this bed are often collected together so as\r\n     to form hard concretionary masses; these masses, by\r\n     becoming more numerous, finally form a hard bed of\r\n     nummulitic limestone intercalated in the clays near the\r\n     top. The junction of the clays with the limestone of Bed\r\n     No. 1 is very irregular                                        16\r\n\r\n  3. Greenish shelly sands and sandy clayey bands, interbedded\r\n     with impure chalky nummulitic limestones with _N.\r\n     gizehensis_, _N. curvispira_, and a third smaller species;\r\n     _Ostrea_ sp.

In some bands large numbers of\r\n       small and large nummulites lie embedded in every\r\n       position, as if tossed about by currents during the\r\n       process of becoming buried by sediment.

The relation of these beds to the\r\nRayan series below is well seen at the prominent outstanding hill\r\nGar el Gehannem (Fig. 2); here the plain to the east and south is\r\nformed of the uppermost member of the Wadi Rayan series, a limestone\r\nfull of _Nummulites gizehensis_. In the hill itself the latter is\r\ndirectly overlain by gypseous and glauconitic sandy clays and marls,\r\nwith hard intervening beds of yellowish, often marly, limestone. The\r\nupper beds consist of alternating clays, sandy limestone and sandstone,\r\nat the top being a thick bed of the latter passing up gradually into\r\nthe sandstones of the Birket el Qurûn series.

The junction of these alluvial deposits and the\r\nunderlying Eocene is distinctly unconformable and an intervening\r\npebble-bed is occasionally present (Fig 3).\r\n\r\nIn the large ravine known as El Wadi, which traverses the west side\r\nof the cultivation of the Fayûm, these beds are frequently well\r\nexposed; their lithological characters remain very constant. Here,\r\nas in El Bats, they are unconformably overlain by a varying thickness\r\nof Pleistocene and Recent clays. Their surface, a plain of subaerial\r\ndenudation, represents the original floor of the depression before\r\nthe entry of the sediment-carrying water from the Nile Valley through\r\nthe Lahûn gap; its irregularity is seen in Plate V.\r\n\r\nThe plain bordering the cultivation to the east of Sêla and Rubiat\r\nlikewise consists of these same white marls with fish-scales,\r\netc.; they pass regularly under the cultivated land. Shaly marls,\r\ngypseous clays, and chalky limestones of the same age are seen in,\r\nand to the south of, the railway crossing the desert between Sêla\r\nand Medum. Eastwards they stretch into the Nile Valley, being found\r\nexposed along the desert-edge bordering the cultivation at Medum,\r\nNawamis and Masaret-Abusia.\r\n\r\n                         { 1.

They are again well seen\r\nin the ravine below the last named village, and forming the narrow\r\nstrip of the desert projecting into the cultivation as far as the\r\nnorthern end of the Tamia lake; they also occur on the shore of the\r\nlatter at El Tuba, about 2 kilometres south of the village. At Tamia\r\ntheir exposure measures 25 metres in thickness.\r\n\r\nAt various points along the north side of the Birket el Qurûn\r\nexposures of this series occur, the beds forming the lower sloping\r\npart of the cliffs overlooking the lake, as well as the base of the\r\nisland “Geziret el Qorn,” although only the upper beds are visible\r\nabove the water of the lake. Both here and along the northern shore of\r\nthe lake they are for the most part hidden by the high level recent\r\nlacustrine clays, but where occasionally exposed their identity is\r\ncertain, the characteristic small brown fish-scales being abundant,\r\nbesides occasional teeth, with shell-impressions of the different\r\ngenera enumerated above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nESCARPMENT OF THE BIRKET EL QURUN SERIES NEAR THE WESTERN END OF\r\nTHE LAKE.]\r\n\r\nAt the western end of the lake the Ravine beds form the lower part\r\nof the cliff as well as the plain to the south; the underlying\r\n_Nummulites gizehensis_ limestone not being exposed. The series\r\nconsists of some 45 metres of white and grey shaly marls with harder\r\nbands of siliceous limestone intercalated throughout, one of which\r\nusually forms the uppermost bed. It is, in fact, the development in\r\nplaces of one or other of these hard beds of limestone near the top\r\nof the series that gives rise to the bold promontories, or horns,\r\nwhich occur on the north side of the Birket el Qurûn.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the marls and clays met with from 18·5 to 112·5\r\nmetres below the surface in the boring at Medinet el Fayûm in all\r\nprobability belong to the Ravine beds.\r\n\r\nThe maximum thickness of this series is 70 metres, measured at Gar\r\nel Gehannem.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _C._—=Birket el Qurun Series= (_Operculina-Nummulite Beds_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above designation is convenient and applicable to these beds,\r\nwhich form the escarpment immediately overlooking the lake on the\r\nnorth side throughout its length.\r\n\r\nThe group includes all the beds between those last described and\r\nthe well-marked Qasr el Sagha series, homotaxial with the Upper\r\nMokattam (the brown beds) of Jebel Mokattam, near Cairo. It thus\r\nappears to be the equivalent of the upper part of the white\r\nbeds (quarried limestones) of the Mokattam section, although\r\nthe lithological characters are entirely different, the massive\r\nlimestones of Jebel Mokattam being represented in the Fayûm by an\r\narenaceous and argillaceous series, deposited probably in water of\r\nfar less depth. Where the different members of this series are well\r\nexposed certain beds are found to be characterized by the abundance\r\nof two foraminifera, the one a small thin-shelled _Operculina_\r\n(_O. discoidea_)., and the other a small thick nummulite.[43] The\r\ntests of these foraminifera sometimes make up entire bands of rock. In\r\naddition, the series includes certain beds which at times become very\r\nfossiliferous, and contain a well-preserved molluscan fauna.\r\n\r\nThe series is well seen in the desert separating the Fayûm from the\r\nNile Valley; on the south-east and east sides of the former; along\r\nthe northern boundary of the cultivation and the Birket el Qurûn;\r\nand westwards in the cliffs to beyond the outlying hill-mass of Gar\r\nel Gehannem.\r\n\r\nThe following section was measured on the south-west of the Fayûm,\r\nfrom Ezba Qalamsha (on the confine of the cultivation) to the ridge\r\nsummit 5 kilometres to the south-east.\r\n\r\n  _Top._                                                         Metres.\r\n\r\n              Summit of ridge 5 kilometres south-east of Ezba\r\n              Qalamsha.\r\n\r\n                Pliocene Raised Beach with occasional _Ostrea\r\n                cucullata_, Born., made up of gravels with\r\n                blocks of limestone.\r\n\r\n            {  1.

These masses should be regarded as huge weathered-out\r\nconcretions, rather than as water-rounded blocks, although no doubt\r\nin many cases their roundness has been increased by the action of the\r\nwaters of Lake Moeris as the level of the latter gradually fell, and\r\npossibly still earlier during the invasion of the Pliocene sea; from\r\nthe latter time also may date the millions of parallel vertical borings\r\nwith which these and other exposed rocks are often perforated. In\r\nthe various places where one of these beds forms the present surface\r\nof the desert the concretions may be seen in different stages of\r\nexposure, from the initial, where only just the tops are laid bare,\r\nto the final stage where the globes are left completely weathered out,\r\nas seen in the illustration (Plate VII). The appearance of the desert\r\nwhen covered for many square kilometres with thousands of these blocks\r\nis more easily imagined than described.\r\n\r\nThe lower beds of the Birket el Qurûn series form the island Geziret\r\nel Qorn, and consist of clays and sandstones containing a considerable\r\nnumber of organic remains. These beds were collected from and examined\r\nby Schweinfurth[44] in 1879, the mollusca being subsequently described\r\nby Mayer-Eymar,[45] while the vertebrate remains, which included\r\ncetacean bones and numerous fish-teeth, were submitted to Dames.\r\n\r\nThe following species were determined by Mayer-Eymar, who indicated\r\nthat the fauna as a whole had a Bartonian aspect[46]:—\r\n\r\n                               UPPER BED.\r\n\r\n  _Ostrea plicata_, Defr.\r\n\r\n  _Arca Edwardsi_, Desh.\r\n\r\n  _Lucina pomum_, Duj.[47]\r\n\r\n  _Lucina_ cfr. _tabulata_, Desh.\r\n\r\n  _Cardium Schweinfurthi_, May.-Eym.\r\n\r\n  _Cytherea Newboldi_, May.-Eym.\r\n\r\n  _Tellina pellucida_, Desh.\r\n\r\n  _Mactra compressa_, Desh.\r\n\r\n  _Corbula pyxidicula_, Desh.\r\n\r\n  _Calyptræa trochiformis_, Lam.\r\n\r\n  _Turritella angulata_, Sow.\r\n\r\n  _Ficula tricarinata_, Lam.\r\n\r\n                               LOWER BED.\r\n\r\n  _Astrohelia similis_, May.-Eym.\r\n\r\n  _Goniastræa cocchii_, d’Achiardi.\r\n\r\n  _Heliastræa acervularia_, May.-Eym.\r\n\r\n  _Heliastræa Ellisi_, Defr.

Dames,[48] who compared them with the American species\r\n_Z. macrospondylus_ and _Z. brachyspondylus_, but did not then consider\r\nthem to represent a new species; in a later publication,[49] however,\r\nthe same author described similar but more complete remains, also\r\ncollected by Schweinfurth (from beds belonging to our Qasr el Sagha\r\nseries), as a new species, _Z. Osiris_. A considerable number of\r\nfish-remains from Geziret el Qorn are also described in the earlier\r\npublication. Although the difference in size of the bones of separate\r\nindividuals was considered by Dames to be sexual, it seems probable\r\nthat there are two distinct species of _Zeuglodon_, as the smaller\r\ntype appears to have a much greater upward range than the larger[50];\r\nboth species, _Z. Osiris_, and _Z. Isis_ occur in the Birket el Qurûn\r\nseries, and a very fine mandible of the larger was obtained from these\r\nbeds in the cliffs near the west end of the lake.[51] More recently\r\na third species has been discovered by Stromer and described under\r\nthe name of _Z. Zitteli_.[52]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—Profile of beds of Geziret el Qorn.\r\n\r\n1.

They are,\r\nhowever, generally much richer in fossil remains, which are likewise\r\nusually better preserved than in the lower beds. Some of the brown\r\nsandstones of this series are literally crowded with perfect examples\r\nof many of the typical mollusca; and further west, near the end of\r\nthe lake, foraminiferal bands again become noticeable. Near Dimê the\r\nescarpment of these and the lower beds is gentle and inconspicuous,\r\nbut followed westwards it becomes a bold precipitous cliff, increasing\r\nin height towards the western end of the lake, where it is capped by\r\nthe lower beds of the Qasr el Sagha series.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following section was measured on the mainland[54] opposite the\r\nisland Geziret el Qorn.\r\n\r\n  _Top._                                                         Metres.\r\n\r\n  1.

In many places the effect of weathering of these\r\nrocks is of some interest, numerous “earth-pillars” having been\r\nformed; these are largely the result of the action of blown sand,\r\nassisted by rain, the concretions being left capping pillars of\r\nbrown sandstone, the sides of which are sculptured by the wearing\r\naction of sand. The curious perforate or cellular appearance which\r\nthe weathered surfaces of this sandstone assume after long exposure\r\nare particularly noticeable in this neighbourhood and in the Zeuglodon\r\nValley further west.\r\n\r\nIn the well-marked hill distant 17 kilometres to the north-east of\r\nGar el Gehannem, the soft fossiliferous sandstones of this series are\r\ncrowded with _Operculina_, _Nummulites_, and many species of mollusca\r\nbeautifully preserved.\r\n\r\nAt Gar el Gehannem the series is seen (Fig. 2 and detailed section\r\npage 36) forming part of the slope of the hill, underlain by the\r\nRavine beds, and capped by part of the Qasr el Sagha series. It here\r\nconsists of yellow sandstones divided by a bed of clay; the sandstones\r\nare often crowded with nummulites (of two species); also _Operculina_\r\n(_discoidea?_), echinids, _Balanus_ sp., _Ostrea Reili_, _O. Fraasi_,\r\n_Carolia placunoides_, and species of _Pecten_, _Pinna_, _Cardita_,\r\n_Teredo_, _Turritella_, and _Cerithium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—Section of cliffs, western end of the Birket\r\nel Qurun.\r\n\r\nPleistocene.—(_a_) Lacustrine clays and sands with freshwater shells\r\nand fish-remains; _Middle Eocene_, 1. 14 Clays, sandstones and impure\r\nlimestones; 15 White shaly clays and marly limestones.]\r\n\r\nIn the Zeuglodon Valley, 12 kilometres W.S.W. of Gar el Gehannem,\r\nthe brown sandstones of the Birket el Qurûn series are divided by a\r\nnarrow band of fine-bedded grey clay. Most of the fantastically shaped\r\nhills on the south-west slope of the valley are carved out of the\r\nlower division of the sandstone. The concretionary beds of the Birket\r\nel-Qurûn series are not developed in this neighbourhood. Remains of\r\n_Zeuglodon_ of both species (_Z. Osiris_ and _Z. Isis_) are remarkably\r\nabundant and the skeletons of these cetaceans may be found in every\r\nstage of weathering. The larger species, _Z. Isis_, is the more\r\ncommon, and series of vertebrae, twelve to fifteen in number, can\r\nfrequently be counted in situ. The remains are most abundant enclosed\r\nin the hard brown nodular bands of the series but in such cases it is\r\nalmost impossible to extract specimens of any value. In one instance\r\nan almost complete skull of _Z. Isis_, measuring 116 cm. in length,\r\nwas found enclosed in a large block of the nodular rock.[57] Bones are\r\nfrequently to be observed protruding from the wind-worn sides of the\r\nsmall hills, while those portions of the skeleton already weathered\r\nout litter the ground below. Exposed they break up with rapidity,\r\nalthough where the enclosing rock is softer than the bone itself,\r\nparts of the skeleton beautifully preserved and perfectly free from\r\nmatrix may sometimes be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe molluscan fauna is represented by very large numbers of\r\npseudomorphs in sulphate of strontium (celestine) of the genera\r\n_Lucina_, _Turritella_, _Fusus_ and _Nautilus_, the profusion of\r\nindividuals of a species of the latter being very marked. In the case\r\nof lamellibranchs the radiating bundles of crystals of celestine are\r\nseen to originate from a point placed centrally on one of the valves,\r\nso that on this side (of a slightly weathered example) a radiating mass\r\nof crystals is seen, while on the other appear numerous contiguous\r\ncircular areas, representing the terminal ends of the bundles of\r\ncrystalline fibres or needles. Apart from the quantities of organic\r\npseudomorphs, masses of crystalline celestine occur in the sandstones\r\nthroughout the valley, and altogether the quantity of sulphate of\r\nstrontium present must be very great. The gigantic oysters and other\r\nfossils which occur in some of the overlying higher beds, and the\r\nnumerous individuals of nummulites in the sandstone itself, never\r\nseem to be replaced by celestine.\r\n\r\nNummulites of two species are very abundant in some bands and the\r\npresence in the Zeuglodon Valley of occasional individuals of the\r\nlarge _N. gizehensis_ shows that in favourable localities this species\r\npersisted throughout the time represented by the deposition of the\r\nRavine beds and ranged upward into the basal members of the Birket\r\nel Qurûn series.\r\n\r\nIn the higher hills within the valley, and in the hill-mass on the\r\nsouth side, the yellow sandstones of the Birket el Qurûn series\r\npass up into the basal members of the Qasr el Sagha series. In their\r\nupper limits the sandstones become very nummulitic in places and at\r\nthe top bands made up of _Carolia_ and _Ostrea_ occur. Above these,\r\nin the basal members of the Qasr el Sagha series, huge oysters and\r\nfinely preserved specimens of _Qerunia cornuta_ are conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe dip in the valley is 2° north.\r\n\r\nThe southern face of the hill-mass lying immediately to the south of\r\nthe Zeuglodon Valley is an almost sheer cliff of over 100 metres,\r\ndescending to the silt covered basin below which has already been\r\nnoticed (page 23). On this escarpment the hard nodular marly limestones\r\nof the Ravine beds are seen near the base, overlain by a mass of grey\r\nshaly gypseous beds; above, forming as a rule a vertical wall of rock,\r\nlies the hard massive brown sandstone of the Birket el Qurûn series,\r\nhere undivided by clays; at the top, highly fossiliferous alternating\r\nclays and limestones are found forming the summit of the hills.\r\n\r\nThe exact junction between the Birket el Qurûn series and the\r\noverlying Qasr el Sagha beds is naturally perfectly arbitrary, many\r\nof the fossils being common to both groups. _Carolia placunoides_,\r\nwhich is perhaps the most abundant fossil in the Qasr el Sagha series,\r\nis sometimes very common in the upper beds of the underlying group,\r\nand, as shown before, is common enough in the still lower _Nummulites\r\ngizehensis_ beds of Wadi Rayan. So that, though this fossil itself is\r\nno criterion, its relative abundance in the upper series justifies\r\nthose beds being called the “Carolia beds,” the additional name\r\nof the Qasr el Sagha series being taken from the old ruin of that\r\nname where these beds are fully seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nMIDDLE EOCENE ESCARPMENT (QASR EL SAGHA SERIES) 12 KILOM. WEST OF\r\nQASR EL SAGHA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n             _D._—=Qasr el Sagha Series= (_Carolia Beds_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis division is strikingly developed in the north of the Fayûm,\r\nwhere it forms a bold escarpment of great length, consisting of\r\nan alternating series of very fossiliferous clays and limestones,\r\nwith sands and sandstone in the upper beds, of a total thickness of\r\n175 metres.\r\n\r\nThis series is the equivalent of the well known Upper Mokattam beds of\r\nJebel Mokattam, immediately to the east of Cairo. The cliffs of this\r\nhill are among the best known in Egypt and have been studied by many\r\ngeologists, including Zittel, Schweinfurth, Mayer-Eymar, etc.; these\r\nauthors have classified the whole of the Upper Mokattam of Cairo as\r\nequivalent to the Upper Parisian (Middle Eocene) of Western Europe. The\r\nseries is far better developed in the Fayûm than at Jebel Mokattam,\r\nwhere the total thickness is only some 70 to 80 metres.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the discovery in these beds of a highly interesting\r\nvertebrate fauna, including land animals, the series becomes of\r\nthe greatest importance. As already mentioned, as long ago as 1879,\r\nSchweinfurth, during a journey across the Fayûm, obtained remains of\r\n_Zeuglodon_ in the underlying series from the island in the Birket\r\nel Qurûn. Subsequently[58] he obtained additional remains of the\r\nsame cetacean in a violet marl belonging to the present series, from\r\na locality 12½ kilometres west of Qasr el Sagha[59]; these remains,\r\nas already mentioned, were described by Dames as _Z. Osiris_. Since\r\nthen important finds of land and marine mammals and reptiles have been\r\nmade in different beds of this series; these will be referred to later.\r\n\r\nThe outcrop of the Qasr el Sagha series occupies a large part of\r\nthe northern desert of the Fayûm. The beds are, however, best seen\r\nin the cliffs about 8 kilometres north of the Birket el Qurûn,\r\nwhere they form a steep double escarpment, running east and west,\r\nnearly parallel to the northern shore of the lake. The dip of the\r\nseries being northward at a very low angle, and the upward slope\r\nof the ground being in the same direction, this cliff dies out a\r\nfew kilometres north-east of Qasr el Sagha. A little further north,\r\nhowever, a N.W.-S.E. fold and fault again exposes nearly the whole\r\nof the beds of the series, forming prominent cliffs as before.\r\n\r\nIn the conspicuous hill 17½ kilometres 28° N. of E. (magnetic) of\r\nTamia the series consists of innumerable alternations of clays and\r\nsandy limestone. The calcareous beds nearly always contain numerous\r\nexamples of _Carolia placunoides_, _Ostrea_ and _Turritella_ of\r\nseveral species, but other well-preserved fossils are rare. The\r\nexposed beds here have a thickness of about 55 metres, and are\r\nunderlain by the Birket el Qurûn beds with a well-marked band of\r\nconcretionary sandstone, the thickness of the two series together\r\nbeing 127 metres. The upper beds of the former series are not here\r\nexposed, the top of the hill being formed of well-rounded flint\r\nand quartz pebbles embedded in a base of finely crystalline gypsum\r\n(2 metres thick), a deposit of Pleistocene times.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Tamia a large area of desert is occupied by the beds\r\nof this series; the district has the character of an undulating plain\r\nwith occasional groups of hills and low irregular escarpments. At\r\nthe groups of hills 12 kilometres N.N.E. of Tamia, and just to the\r\neast of Garat el Faras, the Qasr el Sagha beds are found to consist\r\nas usual of an alternating series of sands, sandstones, clays, marls\r\nand limestones, with numerous individuals of _Ostrea_, _Carolia_\r\nand _Turritella_, besides vertebræ, teeth and spines of large fish.\r\n\r\nWe may pass now to the locality where this series shows its best\r\ndevelopment and exposure, the beds being all concentrated in one\r\nbold escarpment, generally divisible into an upper and a lower\r\ncliff. These cliffs overlook the Birket el Qurûn, although distant\r\nusually about 8 kilometres, being separated from the lower escarpment\r\nof the Birket el Qurûn series (immediately above the lake shore)\r\nby a broad plain, the surface of which is usually the dip-slope of a\r\nhard bed of sandstone. From Qasr el Sagha (6½ kilometres N.N.E. of\r\nDimê) these cliffs trend westward, keeping approximately the same\r\ndistance from the north shore of the lake; they have been followed\r\nand mapped for a distance of 70 kilometres to a point 13 kilometres\r\nN.N.W. of Gar el Gehannem, whence they could be seen still trending\r\nin a direction slightly south of west (see Plate XVII).\r\n\r\nSmall faults are of frequent occurrence along these escarpments, but\r\nare not of other than local interest; they almost invariably have their\r\ndownthrow to the north, and it seldom exceeds a few metres. Fig. 5\r\nshows a section through one of these faults near Qasr el Sagha.\r\n\r\nThe following detailed section (Plate XXIII) will show the character\r\nof the beds forming this division. As might be expected in such a\r\nseries, although the calcareous bands are fairly constant, there is\r\na continuous change of character among the sandy and clayey sediments\r\nfrom point to point; the false-bedding is in places very striking.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the section was measured 3½ kilometres north-east\r\nof Qasr el Sagha, but the lower beds not being exposed at that point,\r\nthey were added from the cliffs at the ruin itself. The total thickness\r\nis 154 metres.\r\n\r\n                                                             Thickness\r\n  _Top._                                                     in metres.\r\n\r\n       1.

The\r\nmost prolific bone horizon is, however, about half-way down, i.e.,\r\nthose beds numbered 16 and 17 in the above section; bed 7 also yielded\r\na number of remains. At the point where the upper part of the section\r\nwas measured, 3½ kilometres north-east of Qasr el Sagha, the beds\r\n16 and 17 yielded a considerable number of land-animal remains, all\r\nof which occurred within a fairly confined space, suggesting that\r\nthey had been carried out from the land to this point by a strong\r\nriver-current and deposited when the latter became too feeble to\r\ncarry them further out to sea. The same beds were also examined in\r\nthe faulted bay 8 kilometres to the north, but no bones, or at most\r\na very occasional fragment or two, were obtained here. This is easily\r\nexplained by the greater distance of this locality from the land-mass\r\nto the south. Westwards the same beds were always found more or less\r\nbone-bearing, isolated detached mandibles, limb-bones and vertebræ of\r\n_Mœritherium_, being of frequent occurrence, although no such complete\r\nremains were found as those from near Qasr el Sagha. Reptilian and\r\nfish bones are very widespread throughout the area. An extensive and\r\ndetailed examination of these beds over a large area can hardly fail\r\nto yield important results, as other localities where skeleton-carrying\r\ncurrents came out from the land would very likely be discovered.\r\n\r\nThat the Qasr el Sagha series was deposited in fairly shallow water at\r\nno great distance from land seems certain, not only from the general\r\nlithological character of the beds but from the number of land-animal\r\nremains and the frequency of river and shore-frequenting whales,\r\ndugongs, crocodiles and turtles. The clays, moreover, are found\r\nto abound with impressions of plants, and in some cases are highly\r\nlignitic, being made up of compressed masses of vegetation including\r\nsolid twigs, now found in a state more resembling charcoal than\r\nordinary dense lignites; some bands approximate to an impure brown\r\ncoal. In certain beds of the series further to the west, very thin\r\nseams of true coal occur; they were, however, never seen to exceed one\r\nor two millimetres. The intercalated bands of limestone are generally\r\nimpure and do not indicate any great conditions of depth, but only\r\nrather a temporary cessation in the supply of sand and clay. Corals,\r\nmoreover, abound along many horizons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\nUPPER BEDS OF FLUVIO-MARINE SERIES WITH BASALT CAP, LOOKING WEST FROM\r\nTHE EASTERN EXTREMITY OF JEBEL EL QATRANI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n         SECTION XI.—UPPER EOCENE (BARTONIAN)—LOWER OLIGOCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _E._—=Fluvio-Marine Series= (_Jebel el Qatrani Beds_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the north of the Fayûm depression the Qasr el Sagha\r\nbeds, forming the uppermost Middle Eocene, are followed by an unique\r\nseries[63] of variegated[64] sands and sandstones, with alternating\r\nbeds of clay and clayey marl. The ever-recurring bands of limestone,\r\nso common to the underlying marine beds, have now almost completely\r\ndisappeared, being represented by only an occasional bed of calcareous\r\ngrit, marl, or thin band of limestone. In the upper part of the\r\nseries occurs a horizontal sheet of basalt,[65] in all probability\r\ncontemporaneously interbedded; this forms a convenient datum line and\r\nmay perhaps be provisionally taken as an arbitrary junction between the\r\nEocene and Oligocene. Although as a rule remarkably barren of organic\r\nremains, certain bands, especially in the upper part, yield numerous\r\nindividuals of a few species of mollusca, including _Lucina_, _Arca_,\r\n_Mutela_, _Spatha_, _Unio_, _Lanistes_, _Turritella_, _Melania_,\r\n_Potamides_, _Cerithium_ and _Pleurotoma_. From such an assemblage we\r\nmay without doubt conclude that the conditions under which the series\r\nwas deposited were estuarine or fluvio-marine, and this is further\r\nproved by the non-marine lithological character of the beds. The\r\nenormous quantities of silicified wood which occur in certain beds,\r\nin the shape of hundreds of trees of great length and girth, together\r\nwith the numerous remains of land-animals, crocodiles, tortoises\r\nand turtles, indicate that rivers of considerable size emerged from\r\nthe land to the south, the coast-line of which was probably not far\r\ndistant. In fact the retreat of the sea, which as already mentioned,\r\nhad probably already begun in Middle Eocene times, was now still\r\nfurther continued, although the cause of this was apparently not so\r\nmuch due to elevation of the land as to the continued deposition\r\nof sediment from south to north beyond the land-shore. We may in\r\nfact regard the series as a huge delta deposit in an area of local\r\ndepression, in which the great accumulation of sediment brought down\r\nfrom the land continually caused the gradual retreat of the sea to\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nThe same conditions would even appear to have continued on to\r\nPliocene times, as from the Fayûm northwards stretches an immense\r\nplain of lithologically similar rocks, evidently accumulated under\r\nsimilar conditions, and which appear to contain newer and newer\r\nfaunas from south to north. Thus, while in the Fayûm the remains\r\nare of Middle and Upper Eocene and Lower Oligocene age, when the\r\nlatitude of Mogara is reached, some 70 kilometres further north,\r\na fauna distinctly Lower Miocene in aspect occurs; further north\r\nagain, as at Wadi Natrûn, Pliocene remains are abundant. We may\r\nhope therefore that this otherwise barren desert, when carefully and\r\nsystematically explored, will yield us a continuous record of the\r\nvertebrate life of the northern part of the African continent from\r\nEocene to Pleistocene times.\r\n\r\nIn the Fayûm, over a length of 80 to 90 kilometres, the basal beds\r\nof the Fluvio-marine series, at a height of only a few metres above\r\nthe top of the Qasr el Sagha series, are frequently found to contain\r\nthe remains of land-animals, often in sufficient quantities to form\r\nin places a true “bone-bed.” Besides land-mammals, remains of\r\nlarge tortoises, turtles and crocodiles, are very common, some of\r\nthe latter being identical with those of the Qasr el Sagha series\r\nbelow. Chelonian and crocodilian remains are to be found on various\r\nhorizons, but so far none but fragmentary mammal remains have been\r\nobserved in the higher parts of the series. It is interesting to\r\nnote that the bones in these beds appear to be most common near the\r\naccumulations of fossil trees, thus suggesting that they were floated\r\nout from the land at the same time and by the same river-currents. The\r\nporous character of the sands and sandstones of this group has resulted\r\nin the remains not being in nearly so hard or durable a condition,\r\nexcept when coated with ferruginous sand, as those in the series below,\r\nalthough the actual state of preservation is even more perfect.\r\n\r\nAnalysis shows that these bones, with the exception of the loss\r\nof all organic matter, have undergone very little change. A sample\r\nexamined by Mr. Lucas was taken from a typically preserved pelvis of\r\n_Arsinoitherium_ and gave the following result:—\r\n\r\n   DETERMINED.

These deposits of sand, apparently brought down\r\nby river floods, are not continuous along any particular horizon, but\r\nare intercalated here and there in the ordinary sandstones, clays and\r\nmarls of the series; they occur chiefly, however, as local lenticular\r\nmasses along a more or less constant horizon near the base of the\r\nseries. The bone-remains are not absolutely confined to these deposits\r\nof river-sand, but like the silicified trees are far more common in\r\nthem than elsewhere. Scattered mammal bones occur in the lower clays,\r\nmarls, and hard concretionary sandstones, while the remains of aquatic\r\nanimals, such as turtles and crocodiles, may be found almost anywhere.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the series in the field, there is no doubt that,\r\nin at least the centre of the area, the deposition of the lowest beds\r\nwas continuous with those of the Qasr el Sagha (Middle Eocene) series\r\nbelow. Followed away from the centre (i.e. the district round Widan el\r\nFaras, the eastern extremity of Jebel el Qatrani) the series gradually\r\nthins out, and eastwards, at Elwat Hialla, some 23 kilometres north\r\nof Tamia, has a thickness of only 40 metres, the basal beds being\r\napparently laid on to a bed of limestone of the Qasr el Sagha series\r\nabout the horizon of Bed 12 in Section XXIII. The junction here is\r\napparently one of perfect conformity as far as the individual beds go,\r\nand the peculiar sequence does not seem to be due to ordinary overlap;\r\nit appears as if the change from marine to estuarine conditions had\r\nset in earlier here than further to the west, with the result that\r\nthe upper Qasr el Sagha beds are wanting. Moreover, the accumulation\r\nof estuarine beds went on so slowly in this locality that the series\r\ndoes not attain to nearly its normal thickness, while further east it\r\ndies out altogether. The slight dip to the north is identical in both\r\nseries, their lithological characters being, however, very different.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Qasr el Sagha series contains numerous bands of clay and\r\nsandstone, the continual recurrence of thick beds of limestone at once\r\ngives it a distinguishing feature from the group under discussion;\r\nthe latter is in fact characterized by the highly-coloured sandy, and\r\nto less extent clayey, character of its beds. While the Middle Eocene\r\nis essentially marine, the succeeding formation marks the retreat of\r\nthe sea and the incoming of estuarine and brackish water conditions.\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the age of the Fluvio-marine series it will be well\r\nto describe its development in the field. The beds of the complex are\r\nthroughout the district always found following on above the Qasr el\r\nSagha beds, although their thickness varies considerably, as might\r\nbe expected in a series of this nature. The most easterly locality\r\nto which the formation was mapped is the scarp 23 kilometres due\r\nnorth of Tamia, known as Elwat Hialla. Here the beds form a separate\r\nescarpment, consisting of only about 40 metres of sands and sandstone\r\ngrit (sometimes silicified) with pieces of silicified wood: some of\r\nthe beds of sandstone have a concretionary stem-like weathering. From\r\nthis point these beds extend westwards far beyond the western end\r\nof the lake, always forming the highest escarpments of the Fayûm\r\ndepression. A kilometre or two from our most easterly point the first\r\nbasalt sheets are seen, and these, preserving the same level as far\r\nas can be observed, continue some 60 kilometres further west, to a\r\npoint nearly due north of the western end of the Birket el Qurûn. The\r\nseries, only 40 metres thick at the eastern end, gradually thickens\r\nas it is followed westward, until it reaches its maximum development\r\nin the cliffs of Jebel el Qatrani, north-west of the temple of Qasr\r\nel Sagha, where a thickness of some 210 metres is attained.\r\n\r\nJust 29 kilometres N.N.E. of Tamia (6 kilometres N.W. of the prominent\r\nwestern scarp of Elwat Hialla), a long hill offers a good section of\r\nthese beds, which consist of a variegated group of green sands, red\r\nclays, coarse sandstones, red and yellow sand and sandstone, etc.,\r\ncapped by a band of hard impure yellowish limestone with numerous\r\nenclosed sand-grains (calcareous grit). Near the same place is an\r\ninterbedded sheet of basalt, which is sometimes followed by another\r\nband of impure limestone and the latter by false-bedded sandstone. Huge\r\nlogs of weathered-out silicified trees are seen strewn about.\r\n\r\nThe following is a detailed section of the series, measured from a\r\npoint 3½ kilometres W.N.W. of Elwat Hialla, and about 28 kilometres\r\nN.N.W. of Tamia, to the top of the escarpment 4 kilometres further\r\nnorth:—\r\n\r\n   Undulating sandy, gravel-covered desert[66] stretching northwards.\r\n\r\n  _Top of escarpment._                                          Metres.\r\n\r\n   1.

Below comes a bed of yellowish\r\nimpure limestone and below this an interbedded sheet of basalt 21\r\nmetres thick, underlaid by more white sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe series has almost always a constant dip of two or three degrees\r\nto the north. Silicified trees are very commonly found strewn over\r\nthe surface both near the base and high up in the series.\r\n\r\nAt a point about 14 kilometres north of Qasr el Sagha definite organic\r\nremains other than bone-fragments were for the first time met with\r\nin the series. Here a fragment of ochreous-coloured grit containing\r\nnumerous specimens of a small _Melania_ was picked up and similar\r\nrocks were afterwards found _in situ_. Calcareous grits and impure\r\nlimestones occurred at the same spot, and one of the harder more\r\ncompact bands of limestone was found to contain casts of _Cerithium_.\r\n\r\nAlso at a point 9 kilometres north of Qasr el Sagha hard\r\ngrey limestones, generally compact and cherty, and sometimes\r\nsemi-crystalline, are present, containing casts of _Melania_,\r\nfrequently filled with calcite. These overlie variegated sandstones,\r\nand occur at about 40 metres below the basalt near the top of the\r\nescarpment.\r\n\r\nBlanckenhorn has determined my fossils from these localities as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n_Melania_ nov. sp., allied to _M. Nysti_ of the Oligocene.\r\n\r\n_Potamides scalaroides_, Desh., an important guiding form of the\r\nMiddle Beauchamp Sands of the Paris Basin, and thus Upper Eocene.\r\n\r\n_Potamides tristriatus_, Lam., of the Parisian (_Cerithium crispum_,\r\nDesh.,) is nearly related to the frequent Middle and Upper Eocene\r\n_C. perditum_, Bay, between which, according to Cossmann, transitions\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n_Cerithium tiarella_, Desh., of the Middle and Upper Eocene, but more\r\nespecially in the latter.\r\n\r\nBlanckenhorn considers these determinations as certain, and thus\r\nmarking the complex as Upper Eocene, on the level of the “Beauchamp\r\nSands” of the Paris Basin, and consequently of the Lower Headon\r\nHill beds and Barton Clay of the South of England.\r\n\r\nThe following section was measured from the base of the series, 2½\r\nkilometres N.N.W. of Qasr el Sagha, to the summit of the escarpments,\r\n2 kilometres N.N.W. of Widan el Faras.

Martens, Director of the Conchological Collection of\r\nthe Natural History Museum. The greater number of the forms have a\r\ndistinctly tropical, and more especially Central African, character.\r\n\r\n_Unio_ sp., small, related to the recent _U. Nyassænsis_ of Lake\r\nNyassa.\r\n\r\n_Unio_, related to _U. Homsensis_[71] Lea, from Syria, and\r\n_U. Bonneaudi_ from Cochin China, with many radial folds behind the\r\numbo which run obliquely from the blunt edge backwards towards the\r\nhinge-border.\r\n\r\n_Unio_, related to _U. teretiusculus_, Phil. (_Caillaudi_, Fer.,\r\n_lithophagus_, Ziegli.) of the Nile.\r\n\r\n_Pseudodon?_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Mutela_ (a genus of tropical Africa) sp., long, with a straight\r\nfinely-toothed hinge-border which very much recalls that of _Barbatia_\r\n(a sub-genus of _Arca_).\r\n\r\n_Spatha_ sp. related to _S. dahomeyensis_ and _S. Droueti_ of Assinia\r\nin West Africa.\r\n\r\n_Lanistes carinatus_,[72] scarcely distinguishable from the Nile form.\r\n\r\nThe _Melania_ occurring in mass in the uppermost calcareous bed\r\nappears to be a new species[73] whose nearest relation must in any\r\ncase be _M. Nysti_ of the Oligocene, not _M. muricata_ of the Eocene,\r\namongst forms at present known.\r\n\r\n_Turritella angulata_, Sow. A marine form, occurring below the\r\nbasalt and indubitably this species, as it is well preserved and\r\neasily determined[74]; _T. angulata_ ranges from the Middle Eocene\r\nto the Lower Oligocene of the East and occurs in the Upper Mokattam\r\nof Syria.”\r\n\r\nFrom Widan el Faras the series continues westwards, forming several\r\nescarpments, the uppermost that of Jebel el Qatrani, and maintaining\r\nthe same general characters. The tripartite character of the series,\r\nalready noticeable between Qasr el Sagha and Widan el Faras (see\r\nforegoing section) becomes still more marked. The lowest division is\r\nvery largely composed of fluviatile sands and sandstones, frequently\r\ncoarse-grained and usually markedly current-bedded, divided by clays\r\nand containing an abundance of silicified trees and quantities of\r\nvertebrate remains. These soft beds, some 60 metres in thickness,\r\nhave as a rule an extensive outcrop, forming an undulating plain\r\naveraging two or three kilometres in width. They are overlaid by\r\nsome 17 metres of harder dark red sandstones, which invariably form\r\na well-marked escarpment capped by a very constant two or three\r\nmetres band of hard white or pinkish calcareous grit. This grit\r\nvaries in composition, frequently passing into a marl; and one of the\r\ncharacteristics of this and the underlying red beds is the abundance\r\nof nodular masses of calcite and gypsum. In some localities, as for\r\ninstance 3 kilometres W.N.W. of Qasr el Sagha, numerous spherical\r\nnodules of beekitic chalcedony occur in the beds of this division,\r\nand some of these when broken are found to be geodes lined with\r\nbeautiful crystals of quartz and calcite.\r\n\r\nThe next division consists of some 60 metres of alternating sandstones\r\nand clays with occasional thin calcareous bands in the upper part, and\r\ncapped by a well-marked hard cherty limestone, frequently passing into\r\na dense tabular chert or flint. This exceptionally hard band generally\r\nforms a dip-slope plain of some width, before the softer basal members\r\nof the third and highest division overlie it. The siliceous bed caps\r\nmany of the most notable hills in the district; among others may be\r\nmentioned the big isolated hill 9 kilometres north-west of Garat el\r\nEsh, and the hills five kilometres N.N.E. of the same point. This\r\nis the only horizon throughout the Eocene succession of the Fayûm\r\non which an abundance of flint is met with; that it was well known\r\nand exploited in early times is evident from the old pits met with\r\non the summits of the hills overlooking the main bone-pits, a few\r\nkilometres north of Garat el Esh. As no worked flints were noticed\r\nround the workings it is probable that the material was excavated and\r\ncarried away to the borders of the lake, there to be fashioned into\r\nthe harpoons, saws and other implements which are so commonly found\r\nscattered at the present day near the margin of the old lake site.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost division of the Fluvio-marine series consists of over\r\n100 metres of variegated sediments and forms the escarpment of Jebel\r\nel Qatrani itself, capped by the conspicuous band of hard black\r\nbasalt, which is itself overlain by a further 20 metres of similar\r\nsediments. The basalt has a thickness of over 20 metres in places,\r\nthough its average is considerably less; at the base it is frequently\r\ndecomposed, soft, and of a brown colour.\r\n\r\nAt a point due north of the western end of the Birket el Qurûn the\r\ninterbedded basalt sheet terminates, and no further flows were seen as\r\nfar as the point up to which the series was mapped, nearly due north\r\nof Gar el Gehannem. As far as could be seen on a traverse through\r\nthe Zeuglodon Valley to the south-western limits of the depression\r\nno further basalt flows occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection from the base of the Fluvio-marine series, 2 kilometres north\r\nof Garat el Esh, to the summit of Jebel el Qatrani 5½ kilometres\r\nnorth of the bone-pits.

Silicified trees of two distinct types[75] occur,\r\nand they are met with chiefly on two horizons; usually large numbers of\r\ntrees occur together, completely covering the surface in places; they\r\nlie as a rule scattered about in every direction, although occasionally\r\na large proportion may show considerable parallelism of deposition,\r\nas if arranged by the direction of the current which floated them to\r\nthe spot. They always occur in a horizontal position or parallel to\r\nthe dip of the bed, and it seems quite certain that none of them ever\r\ngrew near where they are now found. The trees never bear attached\r\nbranches, the latter having always been broken off at or near the\r\npoint of junction with the trunk, where the scars are often plainly\r\nseen; this points to the trees having been drifted a considerable\r\ndistance. Many trees over 25 metres[76] in length have been met with,\r\nbut this by no means represents the original height, as the trunks\r\nhave lost considerably in length during transport to their present\r\nlocalities. Although, as a rule, found completely weathered-out and\r\nexposed on the surface, in numerous localities these silicified trees\r\nare to be observed firmly embedded in the sandstones in which they\r\nwere deposited, many being met with in our excavations for bones.\r\n\r\nAs the Fluvio-marine series is followed westwards from the central\r\npart of the area, the different divisions become more and more\r\nattenuated and the outcrops more and more obscured by superficial\r\ngravel. North-west of the Zeuglodon Valley an escarpment capped by a\r\nconspicuous bed of white calcareous grit occurs and perhaps represents\r\nthe lower beds of the series. The higher are lost on the gravelly\r\nundulating plateau above.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _F._—=Age of the “Fluvio-Marine Series”.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beds in question being as a whole remarkably unfossiliferous,\r\na determination of their exact age on palaeontological grounds is\r\nan undertaking of some difficulty. The series, however, in certain\r\nbeds is very rich in vertebrate remains; a considerable number of new\r\nand important forms have already been obtained and further additions\r\nare probable. Until the survey of the area in 1898 it appears that\r\nthe only fossils obtained from these rocks were a few casts and\r\nbadly-preserved specimens of mollusca from the highest beds above\r\nthe basalt, collected by one or two observers from localities between\r\nthe summit of the Fayûm escarpments and the Pyramids of Giza.\r\n\r\nThe Rohlfs Expedition did not visit this part of Egypt, and Zittel[77]\r\ntabulated the beds, which he called the “Schichten von Birket el\r\nQurûn” as doubtfully Oligocene; probably the beds referred to are\r\nthose of the island Geziret el Qorn, which, as already mentioned,\r\nbelong to the lower division of the Birket el Qurûn series, and are\r\ntherefore of Middle Eocene age. Mayer-Eymar[78] states that he was\r\nable to subdivide the series under discussion into Upper and Lower\r\nLigurian and Lower Tongrian. Schweinfurth[79] considered the series\r\nas Miocene, comparing them with the lithologically similar _Scutella_\r\nbeds of Der el Beda to the east of Cairo. Blanckenhorn, on the evidence\r\nof the writer’s fossil collections, states, as already mentioned,\r\nthat the upper part is certainly to be regarded as Lower Oligocene\r\nand the lower part as Upper Eocene.\r\n\r\nFirst as to the stratigraphical position of the series. There is no\r\ndoubt that the lowest beds of the group were deposited (at any rate\r\nin the central part of the area) in practical continuity with the\r\nQasr el Sagha series, which, as shown, is certainly of Middle Eocene\r\nage. A great change in the lithology of the beds, however, makes the\r\njunction a perfectly natural one. We pass from a truly marine series\r\ninto an estuarine or fluvio-marine set of beds, and such a change\r\nnear the summit of the Eocene is not an uncommon one in some parts of\r\nEurope. The stratigraphical position in the field, therefore, favours\r\nan Upper Eocene age for the lower beds. The dip being northwards,\r\nnewer and newer beds are met with from south to north on the great\r\nundulating, but more or less level, desert north of the escarpment\r\nsummit. The occurrence of Lower Miocene beds at Mogara, some 100\r\nkilometres north or north-west, also points to a somewhat younger,\r\nor Oligocene, age for the underlying beds, (i.e., those between the\r\nFayûm escarpment and Mogara). The actual relations, however, of the\r\nbeds in the two localities have not yet been determined, but it is\r\nprobable younger beds are continually met with from south to north.\r\n\r\nUntil the entire collection of fossils has been examined and\r\ndetermined, it is somewhat premature to attempt to fix the age\r\nof the series on palaeontological grounds. Up to the present the\r\nforegoing lists show the species which have been provisionally or\r\nfinally determined. Some of these appear to be identical with species\r\nwhich have been recorded from Upper Eocene deposits of Europe, such\r\nas _Potamides scalaroides_, _P. tiarella_, while others, such as\r\n_Melania_ cf. _Nysti_, _Natica crassatina_ (found below the basalt in\r\nthe so-called Sandberger Hills north-east of the Fayûm escarpment),\r\nare typically Lower Oligocene. Other forms, such as _Turritella\r\nangulata_, are common to both Eocene and Oligocene elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf Blanckenhorn’s determinations of these forms are confirmed, we\r\nmay regard the upper beds, i.e., those immediately above the basalt,\r\nas undoubtedly of Lower Oligocene age. The beds below the basalt\r\nmark the transition from the Eocene to Oligocene, while the base of\r\nthe series, so far unfossiliferous as far as molluscan remains are\r\nconcerned, must be regarded as of Upper Eocene (Bartonian) age.\r\n\r\nWe may hope that when the important vertebrate fauna occurring chiefly\r\nin the basal part of the series has been thoroughly exploited, and\r\nthe remains systematically determined, confirmatory evidence will\r\nbe obtained. At present the only forms described and determined,\r\nbeyond pointing to a pre-Miocene age, do not indicate any definite\r\nhorizon. Probably most of the animals will prove to be new, and\r\nalthough on that account more interesting from one point of view,\r\nwill probably not assist us greatly in the exact determination of\r\nthe age of the beds in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _G._—=The Position of the Land-mass from which the Mammal Remains\r\n                           were Derived.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence of remains of land animals throughout the larger part of\r\nthe Qasr el Sagha series and in still greater quantity in the basal\r\nbeds of the overlying Fluvio-marine series, and occasionally in the\r\nhighest beds also, points to the presence of continental land within no\r\ngreat distance of the area in which these deposits were laid down. That\r\nthe animal-remains were carried out from the land by river currents is\r\nalmost certain, and although in some cases such currents are known to\r\npersist to great distances from their points of emergence, it seems\r\nprobable from the quantity and mode of distribution that the Fayûm\r\nbones were deposited within a moderate distance of land. Moreover,\r\nthe silicified trees, by which the bones are so often accompanied,\r\noccur together in very great quantities, and we should imagine that\r\nthe individual trees would have been far more scattered if they had\r\nbeen floated to considerable distances from land. On the other hand\r\nthe fact that among the hundreds of trees examined, in no single case\r\nwere branches found attached to the trunk, points to the conclusion\r\nthat these trees had travelled great distances; probably the branches\r\nwere lost during their river journey, from constant jamming together\r\nof a great number in a more or less constricted space, and not after\r\nthey had left the river mouth.\r\n\r\nThe exact position of this land-mass is a highly interesting and\r\nimportant question. There is no reason to suppose that land of any\r\nextent occurred to the north, except possibly an occasional island,\r\nsuch as that of the Cretaceous massif of Abu Roash,[80] west of Cairo,\r\nwhich probably formed an island in the sea at that time; without doubt\r\nthe great Eocene sea which covered the area stretched northwards,\r\nand was continuous with that in which the southern European deposits\r\nof this period were laid down. To the west also there was certainly\r\nno land-mass within approximate distances. Eastwards, possibly part of\r\nthe Red Sea Hills igneous range may have formed a restricted land-area,\r\nbut even this is not probable; in fact, it seems certain that we must\r\nlook to the south for the nearest land of any extent. In supposing\r\nthe land lay in this direction we are confronted at the outset with\r\nthe fact that the Lower Eocene limestones stretch southwards for\r\nseveral hundred kilometres. In Egypt the Lower Eocene consists of\r\na great mass of nummulitic limestones, some 400-500 metres thick,\r\nwith no intercalated clays or sandstones except at the base, and was\r\nevidently formed in water of considerable depth. The thickness of,\r\nand superficial area covered by, these limestones show that they\r\nwere formed in a truly open sea, in contra-distinction to a littoral\r\narea; the nummulitic sea in fact covered an enormous part of Europe,\r\nNorth Africa and Asia. To the south of this sea lay the African\r\ncontinent, a land-mass dating possibly from Palæozoic times. Since,\r\nand possibly partly during, the deposition of the Lower and Middle\r\nEocene formations, a gradual elevation of the land or lowering\r\nof the sea, resulting in a retreat of the latter, took place;\r\nthis continually brought the shore-line further northwards until,\r\nduring the deposition of the beds of the Qasr el Sagha series of the\r\nMiddle Eocene, we may surmise that it was not very far to the south,\r\nthough the exact distance is extremely doubtful; while in Upper Eocene\r\ntimes it was still further north. We may assume therefore that the\r\nUpper Eocene bone-bearing strata of the Fayûm represent sediments\r\ntransported by rivers and currents from a fairly adjacent continental\r\nland-mass to the south and laid down as littoral and delta deposits\r\nbeyond the margin of the land. That at least one large river emerged\r\nfrom the land in the neighbourhood of the Fayûm is certain; drainage\r\nwas then, as now, from south to north, although not probably confined\r\nto a single channel like the present Nile.\r\n\r\nApart from broader considerations a minute examination of the more\r\ntypically fluviatile beds favours the conclusion that the currents\r\nwere from the south or south-west. The general dip of the strata,\r\nprobably the natural inclination of the sediments at the time of\r\ndeposit, is from south to north; the most frequent lamination in the\r\ncurrent-bedded arenaceous deposits is also from south to north. In our\r\nexcavations for fossil bones it was noted that of seven tortoise shells\r\nexposed at the same time in different parts of the pit, six lay with\r\ntheir long axes similarly orientated and were distinctly tilted to the\r\nnorth-east, or exactly away from the point of the compass from which,\r\nas will presently be shown, the main river probably came. As a rule,\r\nhowever, the scattered fossil bones and trees in these beds give no\r\ndefinite clue as to the direction from which they were floated. The\r\nexistence of separate accumulations of fluviatile sand at different\r\nhorizons, but lying one above the other in the series and along a\r\nnorth and south line, is of importance as indicating the continued\r\nappearance of a river current from the same quarter.\r\n\r\nBlanckenhorn has published[81] diagrams showing what he supposes\r\nto have been the relative areas occupied by land and sea in\r\nUpper Mokattam, Lower Oligocene, Middle Pliocene and Pleistocene\r\ntimes. Various lines of drainage are shown, the main river, which he\r\ncalls the Ur-Nil, being placed some 70 kilometres to the west of the\r\nmodern Nile, although closely following the trend of the latter. We\r\nhave been unable to ascertain on what evidence Blanckenhorn relies\r\nfor assuming rivers in Upper Mokattam and Lower Oligocene times to\r\nhave occupied the positions shown on his diagrams; the number and\r\npositions of such rivers must remain more or less problematical. In\r\nthis connection however it is interesting to recall[82] the lacustrine\r\nferruginous grits which were brought to notice by the writer in 1900\r\nas having been deposited in a lake, occupying in post-Middle Eocene\r\ntimes a shallow depression in that part of the Libyan desert now\r\noccupied by the oasis-depression of Baharia. Similar deposits were\r\nfound forming the hills of Gar el Hamra a few kilometres east of the\r\nextreme north end of the depression. Finally, during a traverse through\r\nthe unexplored country south-west of Gar el Gehannem in the winter of\r\n1902-1903, hills capped with dark hard ferruginous silicified grits\r\nand puddingstone were met with in the extreme south-west of the Fayûm\r\ndepression at a point nearly midway, and in the direct line, between\r\nthe hills of Gar el Hamra and the chief bone-bearing localities in the\r\nnorth of the Fayûm. The deposits in question—at Baharia, at Gar el\r\nHamra and in the hills to the south-west of the Fayûm—are evidently\r\nof lacustrine and fluviatile origin; and we may infer, with some\r\ndegree of probability, that they were laid down along the course of a\r\nriver which flowed in a north-easterly direction and formed extensive\r\ndelta deposits in what is now the northern part of the Fayûm. That\r\nthis river had its origin in the interior of a well-wooded continent\r\nhundreds of miles to the south of Baharia is not to be questioned;\r\nits size, length and exact position must remain matters of doubt,\r\nbut of its existence we can be as certain as if in times of flood\r\nwe had stood on its banks and watched the passage northwards of its\r\nturbid swollen waters, laden with matted rafts of forest trees and\r\nbearing seawards the carcases of those curious Eocene animals, the\r\nremains of which are so abundant in the Fayûm of to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—Probable Course of chief river of Upper\r\nEocene and Oligocene times.]\r\n\r\nIn the Middle and Upper Eocene beds we first obtain an idea of the\r\nanimals which inhabited Africa in Tertiary times, and the collecting\r\nand working out of this fauna will throw much light, not only on our\r\nactual knowledge of the African vertebrata of the Eocene period,\r\nwhich was practically nil until the discovery of the remains here\r\ndescribed, but also on other wider biological questions, such as the\r\norigin of certain groups of animals, some of which were evolved in\r\nthis part of the world.\r\n\r\nAs recently pointed out by a writer in the Field (No. 2605, Nov. 29,\r\n1902) many years ago the late Prof. Huxley, to account for the\r\npresent distribution of the mammalian fauna of Africa and Magadascar,\r\nadvanced the theory that in the early part of the Tertiary period\r\nMadagascar was connected with Africa, and Africa with Europe or Asia, a\r\nconnection which allowed of the immigration into Africa and Madagascar\r\nof numerous small types of European and Asian mammals. Madagascar\r\nlater becoming separated from the mainland, its fauna, undisturbed by\r\nthe larger carnivora, was able to develop to its present remarkable\r\nextent. Subsequently to the isolation of Madagascar the ancestors of\r\nthe modern fauna were presumed to have invaded the African continent\r\nfrom the north.\r\n\r\nThe extinct fauna of the Fayûm, however, shows that in early\r\nTertiary times Africa already had its own mammalian fauna, which,\r\nbesides containing some remarkable large types of somewhat doubtful\r\nposition, such as _Arsinoitherium_, _Barytherium_, etc., certainly\r\nin _Mœritherium_ and _Palæomastodon_ included the earliest known\r\nelephants, the forbears of the Mastodon and the modern elephants. There\r\nis little doubt therefore that in Upper Eocene and Oligocene times\r\nthese early members of the elephant group ranged northward and\r\neastwards into Asia and India, and since in the Upper Tertiary deposits\r\nof India and eastern Asia the extinct transitional types between the\r\nmastodons and modern elephants appear to have been found, it is not\r\nunlikely that during the later phases of the evolution of this group\r\nof animals the radiation was back towards Africa, so that the African\r\nelephant may be, as it has usually been regarded, an immigrant from\r\nthe Oriental region. Further research among the later deposits of the\r\nFayûm and the deserts to the north may, however, throw an entirely\r\nnew light on the subject and it is somewhat premature to theorise\r\nat present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nRAISED BEACH UNCONFORMABLY OVERLYING MIDDLE EOCENE LIMESTONES (BIRKET\r\nEL QURUN SERIES) IN THE DESERT EAST OF SIRSENA.]\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to notice the observation of\r\nso eminent a palæontologist as Prof. H. F. Osborn. In two recent\r\naddresses[83] to the New York Academy of Sciences he pertinently\r\npoints out his belief that the African continent has been a great\r\ncentre of radiation of certain groups of the mammalia, and especially\r\nmentions the Proboscidea as likely to have been evolved in the\r\nEthiopian region. Our discoveries in the Fayûm and Andrews’s\r\ndeterminations, made subsequently to these addresses, so completely\r\nconfirm this view, at any rate with regard to the elephants, that it\r\nmay not be out of place to give here a somewhat lengthy extract of his\r\n“_Theory of Successive Invasions of an African Fauna into Europe_”\r\n(op. cit. pp. 56-58). “In Europe there are in the Upper Eocene two\r\nclasses of animals, first those which have their ancestors in the older\r\nrocks; second, the class including certain highly specialized animals\r\nwhich have no ancestors in the older rocks, among these, perhaps,\r\nare the peculiar flying rodents or _Anomaluridæ_, now confined to\r\nAfrica, and secondly the highly specialized even-toed ruminant types\r\nthe anoplotheres, xiphodonts and others, the discovery of which in the\r\ngypse near Paris Cuvier has made famous. It is tempting to imagine\r\nthat these animals did not evolve in Europe but that they represent\r\nwhat may be called the first invasion of Europe by African types from\r\nthe Ethiopian region.\r\n\r\n“It is a curious fact that the African continent as a great\r\ntheater of adaptive radiation of Mammalia has not been sufficiently\r\nconsidered. It is true that it is the dark continent of palæontology\r\nfor it has no fossil mammal history; but it by no means follows that\r\nthe Mammalia did not enjoy there an extensive evolution.[84]\r\n\r\n“Although it is quite probable that this idea has been advanced\r\nbefore, most writers speak mainly or exclusively of _the invasion\r\nof Africa by European types_. Blanford and Allen, it is true, have\r\nespecially dwelt upon the likeness of the Oriental and Ethiopian\r\nfauna, but not in connection with its antecedent cause. This cause\r\nI believe to have been mainly an invasion from south to north,\r\ncorrelated with the northern extension of Ethiopian climate and\r\nflora during the Middle Tertiary. It is in a less measure due to a\r\nmigration from north to south. Let us therefore clearly set forth\r\nthe hypothesis of _the Ethiopian region or South Africa as a great\r\ncenter of independent evolution_ and as the source of successive\r\nnorthward migrations of animals, some of which ultimately reached\r\neven the extremity of South America, I refer to the Mastodons. This\r\nhypothesis is clearly implied if not stated by Blanford in 1876 in\r\nhis paper upon the African element in the fauna of India.\r\n\r\n“The first of these migrations we may suppose brought in certain\r\nhighly specialized ruminants of the Upper Eocene, the anomalures\r\nor peculiar flying rodents of Africa; with this invasion may have\r\ncome the pangolins and ard varks, and possibly certain armadillos,\r\n_Dasypodidæ_, if M. Filhol’s identification of _Necrodasypus_ is\r\ncorrect. A second invasion of great distinctness may be that which\r\nmarks the beginning of the Miocene when the mastodons and dinotheres\r\nfirst appear in Europe, also the earliest of the antelopes. A\r\nthird invasion may be represented in the base of the Pliocene by\r\nthe increasing number of antelopes, the great giraffes of the Ægean\r\nplateau and in the upper Pliocene by the hippopotami. With these forms\r\ncame the rhinoceroses with no incisor or cutting teeth, similar to the\r\nsmaller African rhinoceros, _R. bicornis_. Another recently discovered\r\nAfrican immigrant upon the Island of Samos in the Ægean plateau is\r\n_Pliohyrax_ or _Leptodon_, a very large member of the Hyracoidea,\r\nprobably aquatic in its habits, indicating that this order enjoyed\r\nan extensive adaptive radiation in Tertiary times.\r\n\r\n“It thus appears that the Proboscidea, Hyracoidea, certain edentata,\r\nthe antelopes, the giraffes, the hippopotami, the most specialized\r\nruminants, and among the rodents, the anomalures, dormice and jerboas,\r\namong monkeys the baboons, may all have enjoyed their original\r\nadaptative radiation in Africa; that they survived after the glacial\r\nperiod, only in the Oriental or Indo-Malayan region, and that this\r\naccounts for the marked community of fauna between this region and\r\nthe Ethiopian as observed by Blanford and Allen.\r\n\r\n“Against the prevalent theory of Oriental origin of these animals\r\nare: first, the fact observed by Blanford and Lydekker in the Bugti\r\nBeds (Sind) that the Oligocene or lower Miocene fauna of the Orient is\r\nmarkedly European in type; second, that if these animals had originated\r\nin Asia some of them would have found their way to North America;\r\nthird, the fact that all these animals appear suddenly and without\r\nany known ancestors in older geological formations. These are the\r\nmain facts in favor of the Ethiopian migration hypothesis.”\r\n\r\nThat Professor Osborn’s main contention has already been partly\r\nproved by the Fayûm mammal discoveries is apparent, and how far his\r\ndetailed remarks are confirmed will be seen when the new fauna has\r\nbeen more completely explored and examined.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the new species already obtained:—\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+----------------------------------\r\n            UPPER EOCENE.           |         MIDDLE EOCENE.\r\n  ----------------------------------+----------------------------------\r\n                                _Mammalia_\r\n\r\n   Arsinoitherium Zitteli, Beadnell.|Barytherium grave, Andr.\r\n                                    |\r\n     „   Andrewsii, Lankester.      |Mœritherium Lyonsi., Andr.\r\n                                    |\r\n   Palæomastodon Beadnelli, Andrews.|  „   gracile,  „\r\n                                    |\r\n     „   minor,  „                  |  „   sp.,  „\r\n                                    |\r\n   Mœritherium Lyonsi,  „           |Eosiren libyca,„\r\n                                    |\r\n     „   trigodon,  „               |Zeuglodon Osiris, Dames.\r\n                                    |\r\n   Megalohyrax eocænus,  „          |  „   Zitteli, v.

The slight depression\r\nof Mogara, some 100 kilometres further north-west, is however cut\r\nout in Lower Miocene beds, lithologically somewhat similar to the\r\nUpper Eocene and Oligocene deposits of the Fayûm. Probably similar\r\nconditions obtained throughout, and the existence of vertebrate remains\r\nindicates the persistence of river-currents from the south. The fauna\r\nof the Mogara beds has only as yet been very incompletely examined,\r\nthe locality being rather inaccessible.[85]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION XII.—PLIOCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have presumed that in Miocene times the Fayûm remained land, no\r\ntraces of deposits of that age having been recorded; possibly the area\r\nunderwent considerable denudation during the Miocene and early Pliocene\r\nperiods, but of this it is difficult to adduce definite evidence. The\r\nrecords of Pliocene times in the Fayûm may be classed as follows:—\r\n\r\n  (J). _Marine deposits_ of Middle Pliocene age.\r\n\r\n  (K). _Borings_ on rock surfaces, exact age doubtful.\r\n\r\n  (L). _Gravel Terraces_, probably late Pliocene.       } (or early\r\n                                                        } Pleistocene).\r\n  (M). _Gypseous Deposits_, probably latest Pliocene.   }\r\n\r\n\r\n                _J._—=Marine Deposits: Middle Pliocene.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Middle Pliocene times the area, which had probably undergone\r\nconsiderable denudation, was again invaded by the sea, and we find\r\nat Sidmant el Jebel, on the south-east side, definite evidence of\r\ndeposits of this age in the shape of sands containing such well known\r\nforms as _Ostrea cucullata_ and _Pecten benedictus_.\r\n\r\nThe beds in question reach an altitude of from 60 to 70 metres and\r\nwere first brought to notice by Schweinfurth. Although they are in\r\nreality on the Nile Valley side of the separating ridge or saddle,\r\nthere is little doubt that the same beds will, when looked for, be\r\nfound within the Fayûm depression in places where they have been\r\npreserved. As has already been mentioned this south-eastern side of\r\nthe Fayûm yet remains to be examined and mapped in detail, and the\r\ndetermination of the relation of these marine sands to the gravel\r\nterraces shortly to be described is a matter of primary importance\r\nfor the proper interpretation of their relative ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _K._—=Borings on Rock surfaces; of doubtful age.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are within the Fayûm depression numerous rock-surfaces pierced\r\nby borings, apparently the work of marine boring mollusca but naturally\r\noffering no exact evidence as to their age and origin. These borings\r\nare found at two distinct levels, approximately from zero to 20 metres\r\nabove sea-level, and at 112 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        (α) _Low level borings._\r\n\r\nBetween Tamia and Dimê, near the eastern end of the Birket el Qurûn,\r\nthe lowest ground, consisting of poor sandy land with tamarisk scrub,\r\nbordering the lake and cultivation, is bounded by a low escarpment\r\nof beds of the Birket el Qurûn series. Along certain horizons one\r\nor more beds of calcareous sandstone weather into large globular\r\nmasses, which as already pointed out are in reality huge concretions,\r\nbut which may have been further rounded by water-action. The chief\r\npoint is, however, the fact that these blocks are honey-combed in the\r\nmost remarkable way by beautiful examples of borings; their presence\r\nwas first noticed by Schweinfurth. The globular masses of sandstone,\r\noften several feet in diameter, are worn on the surface into a number\r\nof parallel ledges, each of which is perforated with countless numbers\r\nof vertical holes, averaging 10 millimetres in diameter (maximum 15\r\nmillimetres), placed at right angles to the ledges; these holes are\r\nnot, as a rule, connected from one ledge to another. They occur in\r\nevery stage of perfection, from hollows as small as the finger tips\r\nand only a few millimetres deep, to long completed chambers which\r\ngenerally show considerable tapering, and are often placed so close\r\ntogether that the dividing wall is pierced.\r\n\r\nFig. 7 and Plate XIII show the appearance of these bored rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—Block of sandstone pierced by numerous\r\nborings.]\r\n\r\nAt El Kenîsa, a promontory jutting out into the lake, sandstones\r\nshowing shell-borings occur at a height of 14 metres above\r\nsea-level. Between Dimê and the lake a calcareous sandstone contains\r\nmany borings, 66 metres above the lake-level, or about 22 metres\r\nabove sea-level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\nBORINGS IN FALSE-BEDDED SANDSTONE, TWO KILOMETRES SOUTH OF DIMÊ.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       (β) _High level borings._\r\n\r\nFurther west, but at a considerably higher level, borings are again\r\nmet with. In this case a hard compact limestone, forming a dip-slope\r\nsurface on the top of the lower cliff of the Qasr el Sagha series,\r\nwas found pierced with borings, similar in character to those of the\r\nlower level. The exact locality where these high level borings were\r\nobserved is 14 kilometres west of the western end of the lake and 16\r\nkilometres north-east of the eastern extremity of Gar el Gehannem. The\r\nheight was determined as 156 metres above the Birket el Qurûn,\r\nor 112 metres above sea-level, and we have every reason to believe\r\nthese figures to be approximately correct. Up to the present time\r\nborings at this altitude have not been met with in any other locality.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it seems surprising that the occurrences should be so\r\nlimited, but it should be remembered that only in those cases where\r\nborings were made in the very hardest and most durable rocks could\r\nthey have been preserved to the present time. Considering the amount\r\nof denudation which has taken place in the area since the Pliocene\r\nperiod it is surprising that any of the rocks which formed the actual\r\nsurface of the country at that date should still be preserved; and\r\nin all probability the comparatively few records that exist to-day\r\nowe their preservation to the protection afforded by superficial\r\ndeposits. Under the present rigorous desert conditions, when the whole\r\nsurface is subjected to continual and rapid changes of temperature,\r\nand every exposed rock is being worn down by the natural sandblast,\r\nit must be admitted that in a comparatively short time every trace\r\nof the borings now exposed will have been removed. At the same time\r\nthe denudation of superficial deposits will probably lay bare other\r\nbored rock-surfaces, and the conserving nature of drift sand itself\r\nwhere accumulated to even a limited degree must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _L._—=Gravel Terraces: ? Upper Pliocene.=\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the north, east, and south-east sides of the Fayûm, well marked\r\nterraces of gravel are found at certain levels up to a maximum of\r\nabout 170-180 metres above sea-level. Nine kilometres east of Sêla\r\nthe summit of the ridge separating the Fayûm and the Nile Valley is\r\nformed of thick deposits of gravel, laid irregularly and unconformably\r\non the top of limestones belonging to the Birket el Qurûn series. The\r\nlowest terrace occurs only 15 metres above the canal[86] running\r\nalong the outside of the cultivation. The main deposit of gravel is\r\nlaid on the top of the limestones and marls at 70 metres above the\r\ncanal; it is some 50 metres thick (summit 120 metres above canal)\r\nand consists of a mass of well-rolled flint and quartz pebbles, with\r\nblocks of limestone (frequently full of well-known Eocene fossils\r\nsuch as _Carolia placunoides_). Large well rounded blocks of grey\r\nquartzite and pebbles of black quartzite also occur, besides rounded\r\nblocks of silicified wood. A certain amount of false-bedding occurs\r\nand false-bedded sand was noticed in places. Numerous derived rolled\r\nfossils are present, but no contemporaneous remains were found. On\r\nthe summit of the ridge is situated the remnant of an old pyramid-like\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nFig. 8 shows the relation of these gravels to the underlying rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—_Sketch showing relations of Middle Eocene\r\nto Pliocene Gravel Terraces on the east side of the Fayûm._\r\n\r\n_Birket el Qurun series._—(_a_) Clays, marls and limestone;\r\n(_b_) Limestones with _Operculina_ (_O. discoidea?_). Pliocene\r\n(to Pleistocene); (_c_) Coarse deposits of gravel, etc., with huge\r\nblocks of derived Eocene limestone with _Carolia_, etc.; (_d_) sands\r\nand sandrock with leaves of hard sandstone; (_e_) sand, gravel and\r\nconglomerate.]\r\n\r\nAt the spur of the cliff immediately to the east the terrace is\r\nlaid on to limestones of the Birket el Qurûn series at a height of\r\n32 metres above the canal. Enormous blocks of _Carolia_-limestone,\r\nsome exceeding 3 × 2 × 1·5 metres in measurement, are included in\r\nthis deposit; such blocks cannot have been transported far, and were\r\ndoubtless derived from formerly-existing higher beds in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. The matrix of the deposit is usually crushed limestone\r\nwith sand and gravel. Occasional fragments of silicified wood (and\r\nfurther west large logs), evidently derived from the Fluvio-marine\r\nbeds, also occur.\r\n\r\nIn favoured localities the relation of the gravels to the Eocene is\r\nstill better seen; the lower beds of the terrace here are sometimes\r\nformed of sands and sandy beds dipping 10° eastward.\r\n\r\nAt the little promontory 9 kilometres east of Sersena the same deposits\r\nreach an altitude of 157 metres above the canal below.\r\n\r\nFurther north another cake of gravel caps the summit, attaining\r\nhere 60-70 metres above the canal-level. Probably these deposits\r\nwere originally more or less connected and continuous, but since\r\ntheir deposition denudation must have removed the greater part, as\r\nthey are now only found here and there capping the highest points\r\nof the escarpment along the east side of the Fayûm. Such isolated\r\ngravel-capped hills occur notably 12 kilometres east of Roda, 16½\r\nkilometres east and 17½ kilometres north-east of Tamia.\r\n\r\nAlong the north side of the Fayûm the same deposits are found,\r\nin some cases covering large areas.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five kilometres N.N.E. of Tamia the Eocene beds, here an\r\nalternating series of clays and limestones, are capped by a deposit\r\nconsisting of coarse rolled gravel, with blocks of silicified wood\r\nenclosed in a sandy gypseous base, some 10 metres thick. A larger\r\nand similar deposit caps the next high ground four kilometres to the\r\nwest, and about 9 kilometres N.N.E. of Garat el Faras; in this case\r\nit forms a round-topped gravelly hill-range, attaining a height of\r\nabout 165 metres above the canal to the south-east. The loose gravel\r\nat many points passes into hard conglomerate, notably in the hills\r\n9 kilometres east and 4 kilometres north-east of Garat el Gindi. At\r\nthe former spot the conglomerate is composed of blocks of limestone,\r\nwith round pebbles of flint and quartz, sandstone and quartzite,\r\nand fragments of silicified wood, cemented by sand and calcareous\r\nmaterial. Blocks of silicified wood also occur strewn on the surface\r\nof these gravel deposits.\r\n\r\nIn the hills north-east of Garat el Gindi the gravel deposits do not\r\noccupy the summit of the escarpment but occur laid on to a platform of\r\nbeds belonging to the Qasr el Sagha series. Behind, another escarpment,\r\nthat of the Fluvio-marine series, rises to the plateau summit.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 will show the general relation of the different formations in\r\nthis part of the district.\r\n\r\nNear Elwat Hialla the deposits contain numerous blocks of basalt\r\nin addition to the usual constituents. The basalt is derived from\r\nthe sheets interbedded at the base of the Oligocene a little to the\r\nnorth. As these gravels are here close to that formation, blocks of\r\nsandstone, basalt, and silicified wood now form a large proportion\r\nof the constituents.\r\n\r\nAlong the north side of the Fayûm depression, to the west of Elwat\r\nHialla, the gravel terraces are almost absent, having been removed\r\nnearly completely by denudation. That the terraces once existed\r\nthroughout this region is however shown by the small patches met with\r\nto the north-east of Widan el Faras, the eastern extremity of Jebel\r\nel Qatrani, and at several points high up on the escarpments as far\r\nwest as the western end of the lake. Beyond the latter point these\r\nterrace gravels have not been noticed; the slopes of the depression\r\nbecome more and more obscured by loose superficial flints washed down\r\nfrom the plateau, and the existence of underlying terrace gravels\r\ncould only be shown by detailed mapping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLIOCENE (TO PLEISTOCENE) —1.

The\r\nheight was probably more accurately determined here than elsewhere\r\nand the upper limit of the deposits was found to lie at approximately\r\n170 metres above sea-level; this figure may indeed be taken as the\r\naverage height of the Pliocene terraces throughout the Fayûm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nPLEISTOCENE LACUSTRINE CLAYS WITH TAMARISK STUMPS IN SITU AT 50 METRES\r\nABOVE PRESENT SURFACE OF THE BIRKET EL QURUN.]\r\n\r\nBriefly then we have shown the existence of the well marked remains\r\nof a gravel terrace 170-180 metres above sea-level, throughout the\r\nsouth-east, east, and north sides of the Fayûm depression, and the\r\nfirst question that suggests itself with regard to these deposits\r\nis, whether they are of marine or of freshwater origin? From their\r\nposition in part capping and in part perched on the flanks of the\r\nescarpments, it is evident that the depression of the Fayûm must\r\nhave been partly formed before their deposition; probably it had\r\napproximately obtained to its present form and dimensions, except as\r\nto depth. The terrace certainly marks the shoreline of the sheet of\r\nwater in which its constituents were deposited, and the surface of this\r\nwater must have attained a height of nearly 200 metres above present\r\nsea-level. It is not unlikely that some of the extensive plains of the\r\nFayûm may owe their existence in part to the presence in Pliocene\r\ntimes of the sea or of a large inland lake, that they may in fact\r\nbe plains of denudation. The plain above the escarpment of the Qasr\r\nel Sagha series, lying between 150 and 200 metres above sea-level,\r\nand stretching throughout a large part of the north of the Fayûm,\r\nhas characters which tend to support this idea.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the gravels are entirely barren of contemporaneous\r\norganic remains, with one exception; near Ez. Qalamsha some examples\r\nof _Ostrea cucullata_ were discovered, and these we believe to\r\nhave truly belonged to the lower beds of the terraces and not to\r\nhave been derived from the undoubted marine Middle Pliocene beds\r\nof Sidmant. If the existence of _O. cucullata_ in these terraces\r\ncould be confirmed we should undoubtedly class them as marine and of\r\nMiddle Pliocene age. But the single evidence of the Qalamsha shells\r\nis not sufficient, and confirmatory occurrences must be obtained and,\r\nif possible, the relation of the terraces to Schweinfurth’s marine\r\nSidmant beds determined, which has not been yet done.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _M._—=Gypseous deposits, probably dating from the close of the\r\n                         Pliocene Period.=\r\n\r\n\r\nOf distinctly later date than the gravel-terraces are the widely\r\ndistributed gypseous deposits of the Fayûm and Nile Valley. These\r\ndeposits are found covering the plain which separates the Nile Valley\r\ncultivation from the Fayûm depression, gradually rising from the\r\nlevel of the former until they overlie the gravels capping the summit\r\noverlooking the Fayûm (Section XXI).\r\n\r\nNear the Pyramid of Medum the following beds are seen at the edge of\r\nthe desert plain:—\r\n\r\n  _Top._                                                         Metres.\r\n\r\n       Pure, gravelly, or marly gypsum                             1-2\r\n\r\n       Clayey shales with gypsum and salt                          1-1½\r\n\r\n       White marly limestone with much salt    } probable      {\r\n       and fish-remains (fish-scales, etc.)    } part of       {   2\r\n                                               } Ravine beds.  {\r\n       Yellow sandstone with fish-scales, etc. }               {   3\r\n\r\nThe gravel deposits along the east side of the Fayûm are always capped\r\nby a gypseous bed. The latter is often 2 metres thick and frequently\r\noccurs as solid and almost pure white crystalline gypsum; sometimes\r\nit is calcareous and is frequently deposited in a tufaceous manner,\r\nespecially resembling a tufa on the weathered surface. At other times\r\nit passes into a yellowish compact mass and may be very saliferous.\r\n\r\nFrequently the deposit is full of rounded pebbles, the latter\r\nbeing often in the greater proportion and forming a sort of\r\ngypsum-cemented conglomerate. Not unfrequently it is impossible to\r\ndraw any divisional line between the terrace gravels and the gypseous\r\ngravels above. Probably they are both closely connected and of Upper\r\nPliocene age.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _N._—=Summary of the Pliocene Period.=\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the above descriptions it is probable that the Pliocene period\r\nis represented in the Fayûm by the following:—\r\n\r\n(1) Marine beds of Sidmant, undoubtedly of Middle Pliocene age and\r\nreaching a level of from 60 to 70 metres above present sea-level.\r\n\r\n(2) Borings on exposed rock-surfaces at two distinct levels, the\r\nlower 0-20 metres, the higher some 112 metres, above sea-level. These\r\nborings appear to be the work of marine boring mollusca, and although\r\nthose on the lower level may perhaps be of Middle Pliocene age with\r\nthe Sidmant beds, the similar examples discovered at a much higher\r\naltitude (112 metres), point to the sea having attained a much higher\r\nlevel in later, perhaps Upper Pliocene, times.\r\n\r\n(3) An extensive beach or terrace of gravel on the south-east, east,\r\nand north sides of the Fayûm, attaining a maximum level of about\r\n170 to 180 metres above sea-level.\r\n\r\nAll the known facts seem to be satisfied if we imagine that in\r\nthe Middle Pliocene the sea occupied the area, depression probably\r\ncontinuing until the 112 metre level with the highest borings was\r\nreached. Perhaps the lowest part of the terraces was formed during\r\nthis time. In the later Pliocene times we may infer that the area\r\nwas occupied, up to 180 metres above present sea-level, by a vast\r\ninland lake, perhaps of brackish water, connected with the sea on\r\nthe one hand and the fiord or lakes of the Nile Valley on the other,\r\nthe deposits of which have been described elsewhere[88].\r\n\r\nAlong the margins of this gigantic lake, these great accumulations\r\nof gravel might well have been formed, chiefly of material derived\r\nfrom the immediate shores, augmented perhaps by a certain amount of\r\nsediment brought by river-currents from the south.\r\n\r\nFinally, from the way in which the gypsum and gypseous deposits are\r\nlaid on the terrace gravels, and from their extension and thickness,\r\nwe may presume that they were deposited on the bottom of just such\r\na lake on evaporation of its water, when the sulphate of lime in\r\nsolution, becoming more and more concentrated, may have been finally\r\nprecipitated.[89]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION XIII.—PLEISTOCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course of events in Pleistocene times is at present obscure. As\r\nfar as can be judged it was during this period that a freshwater\r\nlake, the precursor of the great Mœris, came into existence. It\r\nmight be thought that the early Pleistocene prehistoric lake was a\r\nrelic of the still older body of water of Pliocene times, in which\r\nthe gravel terraces and gypseous deposits were laid down. But such\r\na remnant would have been of a high degree of salinity and could not\r\nhave given rise to the fresh water Mœris. Most probably at the close\r\nof the Pliocene period, after the formation of the gypseous deposits,\r\nthe area became elevated and cut off from the sea and from the Nile\r\nValley marine fiord; probably an extensive body of water remained as\r\nan isolated lake, but this, cut off from external supply, would have\r\ngradually evaporated, its salt being left as a superficial deposit on\r\nthe dried up bed. In early Pleistocene times we may presume the area\r\nbecame dry and was gradually eroded to its present shape and depth. The\r\nsuperficial deposits of salt and gypsum were for the most part removed\r\nas the depression was deepened, while the continuous terrace of gravel\r\nlaid round the greater part of the rim was broken through, except\r\nwhere protected in favourable localities, the constituents being\r\nwashed down and spread out over the lower ground. In course of time\r\nthe region was moulded to its present form and dimensions, or rather to\r\nwhat it would be if the local alluvial deposits were stripped off and\r\nthe water of the lake baled out. The area was an inland depression,\r\nprobably sparsely vegetated like the rest of the higher country and\r\nseparated from the Nile Valley by a low rocky ridge surmounted by a\r\nmore of less continuous terrace of gravel of considerable height and\r\nthickness. In our opinion desert conditions had already set in before\r\nthe early Nile broke down the ridge and formed a lake in the Fayûm;\r\nthe date when this important event first took place is a matter of\r\nconsiderable doubt, as has already been mentioned (pp. 24, 25). We\r\nknow that at the close of the Pliocene period the Nile Valley was\r\na marine fiord (connected with the Fayûm and the Mediterranean)\r\nwhich was replaced in Pleistocene times, probably in consequence of\r\nslight elevation, by a series of fresh water lakes throughout the\r\nvalley. These lakes were probably two or three in number and drained\r\none into the other; the exact position of the barriers is as yet a\r\nmatter of conjecture. Within these lakes thick lacustrine deposits\r\nwere accumulated, so that the basins eventually became to a great\r\nextent silted up. In later Pleistocene times drainage down the Nile\r\nValley appears to have become more pronounced, the barriers between\r\nthe lakes were broken down and the river cut for itself a channel\r\nthrough the lacustrine beds, filling up the old lake basins. From\r\nthis time onwards to early prehistoric times the bed of the river\r\nwould appear to have steadily fallen, as it eroded its channel deeper\r\nand deeper. That this early Nile was a river of considerable size is\r\nevident from the amount of erosion it accomplished in the trough of the\r\nvalley, whence the older lacustrine beds have been almost completely\r\nremoved. Probably in the lower part of its course it swept against\r\nthe base of the dividing ridge between the Nile Valley and the Fayûm\r\ndepression. If, as we imagine, the river was at that time flowing\r\nsome 20 metres higher than at present its currents would have met\r\nwith little resistance from the loosely cemented terrace of gravel\r\nwhich formed the upper part of the dividing ridge. Once this was\r\nbroken down the waters must have poured into the depression behind,\r\nuntil a lake of considerable size was formed. The sediment spread out\r\nover the floor in the shape of a fan, while at the same time deposits\r\nof sands and fine clays, blown and washed into the waters from the\r\nsurrounding shores, were being slowly accumulated in the quieter and\r\nmore remote parts of the lake.\r\n\r\nFor some time subsequent to the first connection between the Fayûm\r\ndepression and the Nile, the latter continued to fall in level owing to\r\ncontinued erosion along its course, possibly the Fayûm again became\r\ncompletely isolated for a time. Subsequently in the earliest historic\r\ntimes under changed conditions the river commenced to carry and lay\r\ndown the modern alluvial deposit of “Nile mud”, and from this time\r\nto the present day its bed has gradually risen. This is shown by the\r\nhigh Nile flood-readings on the early gauges of the Nile Valley; the\r\nnilometer at Roda shows a difference of 1·22 metres in 1026 years, or\r\nan annual rise of 0·12 centimetre, which is equivalent to 12 metres\r\nin 10,000 years[90]. Whether there was ever complete disconnection\r\nbetween the Nile and the originally formed lake in Pleistocene times\r\nis uncertain, but even so it was probably only during a comparatively\r\nshort period: in early historic times the rise of the Nile bed must\r\nhave brought about a reconnection.\r\n\r\nThe geological evidence for the existence of a great freshwater lake\r\nin Pleistocene and prehistoric times is afforded by the well-marked\r\nlacustrine clays and sands which are found over such a large area of\r\nthe northern and western deserts of the Fayûm; the great extent of\r\nthis lake will be seen by an examination of the accompanying maps. Its\r\narea must have been about 2250 square kilometres or about ten times\r\nthe size of the modern Birket el Qurûn. The western limit may even\r\nhave been further west than shown on fig. 10.,[91] as some of the\r\ndesert in the neighbourhood of Gar el Gehannem is very low-lying;\r\nor there may have existed subsidiary lakes in that direction. The\r\nupper limit of these ancient lacustrine clays is between 22 and 23\r\nmetres above sea-level, which exactly agrees with the figure adduced\r\nby Sir Hanbury Brown as the height of the more modern Lake Moeris\r\nfrom the evidence of levels. That Lake Moeris was simply the older\r\nprehistoric lake placed under artificial control admits of no doubt;\r\nthe difficult question being as to when the lake first came into\r\nexistence in prehistoric times.\r\n\r\nThe clays abound in freshwater shells and semi-fossil fish-bones of\r\nexactly the same species of fish (siluroid, etc) as still inhabit the\r\nBirket el Qurûn; probably some are even hardly different specifically\r\nfrom the Middle Eocene forms of the district. In addition remains\r\nof large animals are common, and include _Hippopotamus_, _Elephas_,\r\n_Bubalis_, sheep or goat, and _Canis_, with crocodiles and turtles,\r\netc.[92]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nISOLATED SAND-DUNE NEAR GAR EL GEHANNEM.]\r\n\r\nMartens[93] has described the following species of mollusca from\r\nSchweinfurth’s collections:—\r\n\r\n  _Unio abyssinicus_, Mart.\r\n\r\n  _U. Schweinfurthi_, Mart.\r\n\r\n  _Corbicula fluminalis_, var. _consobrina_ Caill.\r\n\r\n  _Neritina nilotica_, Reev.\r\n\r\n  _Valvata nilotica_, Jick.\r\n\r\n  _Cleopatra pirothi_, Jick.\r\n\r\n  _C. pirothi_, var., _unicarinata_, Mart.\r\n\r\n  _Bithynia_ aff. _Boissieri_, Charp.\r\n\r\n  _Melania tuberculata_, Müll.\r\n\r\n  _Limnaea natalensis_, Krauss.\r\n\r\n  _L. mœris_, Mart.\r\n\r\n  _L. palustris_, Müll.\r\n\r\n  _Planorbis subangulata_, Phil.\r\n\r\nBlanckenhorn has pointed out[94] that this fauna is of special\r\ninterest and differs from all fossil and living faunas in Egypt. It\r\nmight be compared with the _Melanopsis_-fauna of the Nile Valley if the\r\nexceptional _Limnaea_ were replaced by _Melanopsis_ or _Paludina_. Its\r\n_Unio Schweinfurthi_ recalls the youngest alluvial deposits of the\r\nNile Valley, 2nd Cataract, Kom Ombo and Silsila; at these places,\r\nhowever, the beds containing the species in question are at least 20\r\nmetres above mean water level of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe sub-fossil fauna of the Fayûm alluvium, in addition to those forms\r\neverywhere met with in the Nile Valley, includes _Neritina nilotica_\r\nand _Melania tuberculata_, which are common forms of the _Melanopsis_\r\nstage, as well as _Unio abyssinicus_ and _Valvata nilotica_. In\r\ncommon with the present fauna of the Birket el Qurûn it has the five\r\nforms belonging to the genera _Corbicula_, _Neritina_, _Valvata_,\r\n_Melania_, and _Planorbis_. The sub-fossil fauna, which passes into\r\nthe modern fauna of the Birket el Qurûn, shows connection with the\r\nMediterranean and Blue Nile, but has a total absence of White Nile\r\nforms such as _Ampullaria_, _Lanistes_, _Cleopatra bulimoides_,\r\n_Spatha_ and _Aetheria_. Moreover _Limnæa palustris_, although\r\nidentical with the form found on other Mediterranean coasts, is as\r\nyet entirely unknown from the Nile Valley. Blanckenhorn concludes that\r\nthe diluvial subfossil deposits of the Fayûm were produced when the\r\nclimate of Egypt was damper and more Europæan, the Nile carrying\r\nmore arenaceous sediment in place of the mud of to-day and running\r\nat higher level, as it did when the shells of _Unio Schweinfurthi_\r\nwere enclosed in the deposits of Jebel Silsila. Blanckenhorn thinks\r\nthe Nile obtained access to the depression during the last European\r\nice period. This last supposition, coupled with the above comparison\r\nof the Fayûm fresh-water fauna with the Melanopsis stage of the Nile\r\nValley Pleistocene series, shows that in regarding the early Fayûm\r\nlake as dating from prehistoric times Blanckenhorn and the writer\r\nare in agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION XIV.—RECENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may divide the Recent period into two epochs, Prehistoric and\r\nHistoric, always remembering that the line of demarcation is not much\r\nmore distinct than that between Recent and Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _O._—=Prehistoric.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abundance of worked flints on the desert just within and around the\r\nsite occupied by the Fayûm lake in late Pleistocene and prehistoric\r\ntimes, shows that the shores were eventually inhabited by people\r\nwho made and used these primitive tools. That the edge of the lake\r\nwas abundantly wooded is shown by the thousands of well preserved\r\ntamarisk stumps met with at the present day in situ (Plate XIV)\r\nin the clays throughout the former margin of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe implements occur chiefly along the margin of the highest level\r\nof the old lake, and have probably in many cases been buried in the\r\nlake clays until the present time, which would account for their\r\nbeautiful state of preservation. We have not, however, yet actually\r\ndetected them enclosed within the clays, although commonly found lying\r\non the clean wind-worn surface. From the fine degree of workmanship\r\nwe may undoubtedly refer these flint implements to the Neolithic or\r\nlater stone-age, although the exact date is doubtful. That they were\r\nmade and used while the lake still stood at its highest level seems\r\ncertain, but as we have shown above, the lake, as a sheet of water\r\nup to 23 metres above sea-level or thereabouts, probably existed far\r\nanterior to the Egyptian historic period. They might, on the other\r\nhand, as far as the evidence from the position of the lake goes,\r\nhave been used by the inhabitants of the lake-margin down to the\r\ngreat reclamation which took place in Ptolemaic times. As it seems\r\nimpossible to date them by comparison with flints of known age from\r\nany Egyptian period, we may perhaps conclude that they are at least\r\nof older date than the earliest Egyptian records.[95]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _P._—=Historic.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn historical times, under conditions almost identical with those of\r\nthe Nile of to-day, there would have been an annual inflow during\r\nthe flood and outflow back to the Nile when the latter subsided;\r\nduring the inflow a constant supply of Nile mud was brought into the\r\nlake and deposited on the surface of the earlier alluvium, continually\r\naugmenting the thickness of the latter and raising its surface, until\r\nin the central area marshy land began to appear. In the XII Dynasty\r\nthis natural backwater of the Nile, which acted as a more or less\r\nefficient regulator of high and low floods, was brought under human\r\ncontrol by Amenemhat I, and a considerable area of land reclaimed from\r\nthe shallowest part of the lake, or that part of the country now lying\r\nnear Edwa, Medinet el Fayûm, etc. The new artificially controlled\r\nlake was called Moeris, and its wonders are mentioned by Herodotus,\r\nDiodorus Siculus, Strabo and Pliny.\r\n\r\nThe actual position of Lake Moeris has been the subject of much\r\ndiscussion, the late Linant de Bellefonds[96] having asserted that\r\nit was a high-level lake, quite distinct from the Birket el Qurûn,\r\noccupying the gap in the hills by which the Bahr Yusef enters the\r\nFayûm, its encircling bank commencing at Edwa and passing through\r\nBiahmu, Medinet, etc. Sir Hanbury Brown has,[97] however, completely\r\ndemolished Linant’s theory, which is shown to be absolutely\r\nuntenable; and has proved conclusively that the ancient Mœris\r\noccupied the greater part of what is now the cultivated land, as\r\nwell as the area covered by the present lake and a considerable part\r\nof the surrounding desert, the reclaimed land being in fact part of\r\nthe very district Linant supposed the lake to have occupied. Since\r\nthe publication of Brown’s work complete corroborative evidence\r\nhas been forthcoming from two distinct sources, one archæological,\r\nthe other geological. The latter has already been mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—Sketch Map showing approximately the site\r\nof Lake Moeris.]\r\n\r\nIt was clear from the map of Claudius Ptolemy that the route through\r\nthe Fayûm to the Oasis Parva left Bacchias near the north end of the\r\nlake, and passing between Arsinœ and Lake Mœris, reached Dionysias\r\nnear the other end. The archæological researches of Messrs. Grenfell\r\nand Hunt[98] have shown that Bacchias occupied the site of the\r\nmodern Um el Atl close to one end of the Birket el Qurûn, while\r\nDionysias was probably in the neighbourhood of Qasr el Banat or Qasr\r\nel Qurûn. Thus the Ptolemaic Lake Mœris was almost identical with\r\nthe modern Birket el Qurûn. Neither did the sites excavated yield a\r\ntrace of anything older than the third century B.C. Theadelphia and\r\nPhiloteris were founded in the reign of the second Ptolemy, when a\r\ngreat reclamation of the land from the lake took place, and probably\r\nEuhemeria, Dionysias, Karanis and Bacchias date from the same reign.\r\n\r\nThe archæological evidence is thus briefly summed up by Grenfell and\r\nHunt: “Originally the lake filled the whole basin of the Fayûm,\r\nthe first reclamation being carried out by Amenemhat I, who built the\r\ngreat dam at El Lahûn, where the Bahr Yusef enters the province,\r\nand recovered the high ground near the entrance as far as Biahmu,\r\nand a point between Abshawai and Agamiin. This remained the Pharaonic\r\nprovince until the time of Herodotus, when the water still came up\r\nto the colossi at Biahmu. Subsequently all the land now cultivated\r\nbelow the level of the Pharaonic province was reclaimed, chiefly in\r\nthe reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, when Lake Mœris was reduced nearly\r\nto the size of its modern representative, the Birket el Qurûn”.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Present day Fauna of the Birket el Qurûn.]\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the Pleistocene fauna of the Fayûm differs in one\r\nor two particulars from the fauna of the present day. The commonest\r\nliving molluscan forms include the following:—\r\n\r\n  _Corbicula fluminalis_.\r\n\r\n  _Neritina nilotica_.\r\n\r\n  _Cleopatra bulimoides_.\r\n\r\n  _Hydrobia stagnalis_.\r\n\r\n  _Valvata nilotica_.\r\n\r\n  _Melania tuberculata_.\r\n\r\n  _Planorbis Ehrenbergi_.\r\n\r\n  _P. marginatus_ var. _subangulata_.\r\n\r\nBlanckenhorn[99] has pointed out that in this fauna _Hydrobia\r\nstagnalis_, as a typical brackish water form is of special\r\ninterest. The species appears to have established itself in the Birket\r\nel Qurûn in modern times, as it has not been found in the youngest\r\nalluvium of the lake, nor is it known in the modern Nile fauna.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern Deposits: Blown Sand and Erosion.]\r\n\r\nExcept for the gradual accumulation of silt over the bed of the\r\nBirket el Qurûn—sand and clay carried in by the wind and the fine\r\nsediment borne by the feeder canals—the only modern deposits of any\r\nimportance are those of blown sand. The extensive arenaceous deposits\r\nof younger Tertiary age, forming the greater part of the continent\r\nfrom the latitude of the Fayûm to the Mediterranean shores, yield as\r\na result of the action of denudation a constant and abundant supply\r\nof the raw material. The sand carried southwards by the prevailing\r\nwinds accumulates as dunes in the lowest parts of the depressions,\r\non the slopes of cliffs, and in all the less exposed localities. Wind\r\nswept areas remain free or are only gradually encroached on by slowly\r\ngrowing linear dunes originating in the wind-shadow of some protecting\r\nhill or ridge. An unique example of such a dune is to be seen at the\r\nsouth end of the well-marked ridge a few kilometres east of Gar el\r\nGehannem (Plate XV).\r\n\r\nThe main accumulations of blown sand are in the southern part of the\r\nFayûm; large areas of the floors of Wadis Rayan and Moêla are covered\r\nwith dunes, while in their immediate neighbourhood the material has\r\naccumulated to such an extent as to blot out entire cliffs and valleys;\r\nimmediately to the west of Gharaq a considerable area is covered with\r\nsmall but steep dunes; and finally must be mentioned the great linear\r\nbelt of sand, known as the Ghart el Khanashat, which starting from a\r\npoint about midway between the Wadi Natrûn and Mogara comes to an\r\nabrupt termination some 24 kilometres before gaining the northern\r\nescarpment of the Fayûm depression (see page 23).\r\n\r\nAs might be expected in an area like the Fayûm, where sedimentary\r\nrocks of every type are met with, and where the wind never wants for\r\na sufficient supply of the necessary sand, superficial erosion is\r\neverywhere well marked. We do not propose to study here the action of\r\nwind-borne sand and it will be sufficient to mention two localities\r\nwhere the effects are best seen; one is in the neighbourhood of Garat\r\nel Esh, where the most remarkable scoring and grooving is to be seen\r\non the two beds of limestone capping the upper and lower cliffs of\r\nthe Middle Eocene; the other is the Zeuglodon Valley, and here the\r\nsculpturing of the sandstone of the Birket el Qurûn series is of\r\nthe finest and most unique description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE BIRKET EL QURUN NEAR THE WESTERN END.]\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: BEADNELL, _The Fayûm Depression; a Preliminary Notice\r\nof the Geology of a district in Egypt containing a new Palæogene\r\nVertebrate Fauna_.

Skeletons of marine animals such as\r\n_Zeuglodon_ and _Eosiren_ may, however, be frequently observed embedded\r\nin the hard intercalated limestones. Limestone cranial-casts of these\r\nanimals are thus sometimes found, and one of these has already been\r\nfigured and described (Elliot Smith, _The Brain of the Archæoceti_,\r\nProceedings Royal Society, Vol. 71, pp. 322-331. Some most beautifully\r\nformed casts from one of the limestone beds were eventually determined\r\nby Andrews to be casts of the air passages of crocodile skulls.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Schweinfurth appears to have been the first to examine\r\nthese beds.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: One would imagine that there must have been a\r\nconsiderable amount of ferruginous matter in the water at the time\r\nof deposition of the Fluvio-marine series, the prevailing colours of\r\nthe deposits being red and yellow.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Mayer-Eymar appears to believe the depression of\r\nthe Fayûm is the result of the volcanic activity which produced\r\nthese basalt flows. He says (op. cit. _Nouvelles recherches, etc._,\r\np. 218.) “Or, de cette extension extraordinaire du phénomène\r\nvolcanique dans l’ouest du grand désert, il est, en premier lieu,\r\npermis de conclure que c’est par suite de son action excavante\r\nqu’a eu lieu l’effondrement rempli de nos jours, en partie par\r\nle lac de Fayum.”\r\n\r\nPersonally, we cannot see the slightest evidence in support of\r\nthis. Where the basalt occurs as a hard band it usually causes steep\r\ncliffs as at Widan el Faras, owing to its protecting the underlying\r\nbeds from denudation. To the west, in Jebel el Qatrani, its thickness\r\nand hardness determine the character and steepness of the escarpment\r\nbelow.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Pebble bands are occasionally met with in the coarser\r\nsandstones of the Fluvio-marine series, and it would seem that from\r\nthem are derived the pebbles of quartz and flint which so invariably\r\nstrew the desert-surface to the north to beyond the latitude of\r\nCairo. Those flints on the surface are largely broken up and flaked\r\nby changes of temperature, but show comparatively little shaping by\r\nblown sand; the white quartz pebbles on the other hand, while seldom\r\nor never broken or flaked, are invariably more or less facetted,\r\nfrequently into typical “dreikanter” or pyramid-pebbles; below\r\nthe surface both varieties are perfectly water-rounded.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Many of the fossils mentioned in this profile were only\r\ndiscovered after long search, and had to be inserted in the measured\r\nsection afterwards. Their position therefore is only approximate,\r\nas individual beds could not always be correlated at the different\r\npoints where fossils were collected.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: It is not intended to convey the impression that remains\r\nof all these vertebrates were found at the point where the actual\r\nline of section runs. As a matter of fact at that particular point\r\nonly _Palæomastodon_ remains were observed, while most of the others\r\nwere obtained some distance further west. Remains of _Mœritherium_,\r\nprobably identical with _M. Lyonsi_, of the Qasr el Sagha series,\r\nin the shape of a beautifully-preserved and almost complete skull,\r\nassociated with _Palæomastodon_ and _Arsinoitherium_ in these same\r\nbeds, I only discovered in January 1903, at a point nearly due north of\r\nthe western end of the Birket el Qurûn. A preliminary description of\r\nthis skull has been published by Andrews, _Further Notes on the Mammals\r\nof the Eocene of Egypt_; Geol. Mag. Dec. V. Vol. I. No III.

Mayer-Eymar’s division of the lower\r\nbeds into _Ligurien inférieur_ and _Ligurien supérieur_ is hardly\r\nconvincing, especially as no fossils were found by that observer. The\r\ncorrelation of strata in widely separate areas by their lithological\r\nsimilarity is at least open to question, especially with beds of\r\nthis type, which can indeed be exactly matched again and again at\r\nmany levels in the same vertical succession. His diagnosis of the\r\nbeds immediately below the basalt as _Tongrien inférieur_, rests,\r\nhowever, on firmer grounds, as this basalt sheet can be traced across\r\nthe desert to beyond the latitude of Cairo, and is probably everywhere\r\nof approximately the same age.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: SCHWEINFURTH, op. cit., _Reise in das Depression Gebiet_,\r\netc.) p. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: BEADNELL, _The Cretaceous Region of Abu Roash, near the\r\nPyramids of Giza_.
