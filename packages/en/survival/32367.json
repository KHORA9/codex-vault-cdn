HASTINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE TENTH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis text was originally the outgrowth of a series of lectures on\r\nthe subject of dairy bacteriology to practical students in the\r\nwinter Dairy Course in the University of Wisconsin. The importance\r\nof bacteriology in dairy processes has now come to be so widely\r\nrecognized that no student of dairying regards his training as\r\ncomplete until he has had the fundamental principles of this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this volume is not to furnish an exhaustive treatise of\r\nthe subject, but an outline and sufficient detail to enable the\r\ngeneral student of dairying to obtain as comprehensive an idea of\r\nthe bacteria and their effects on milk and other dairy products as\r\nmay be possible without the aid of laboratory practice. When\r\npossible the dairy student is urged to secure a laboratory knowledge\r\nof these organisms, but lacking this, the student and general reader\r\nshould secure a general survey of the field of bacteriology in\r\nrelation to dairying.\r\n\r\nIn this, the tenth edition, the effort has been made to include all\r\nof the recent developments of the subject. Especially is this true\r\nin regard to the subject of market milk, a phase of dairying that\r\nhas gained greatly in importance in the last few years. The changes\r\nin the methods of handling market milk have been marked. The results\r\nof these changes in influencing the quality of milk offered to the\r\nconsumer are fully discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. L. R.\r\n\r\nE. G.

Man\r\nfirst learned by doing, _how_ to perform these various activities,\r\nand a scientific knowledge of the underlying principles which govern\r\nthese processes was later developed.\r\n\r\nThe art of dairying has been practiced from time immemorial, but a\r\ncorrect understanding of the fundamental principles on which the\r\npractice of dairying rests is of recent origin. In working out these\r\nprinciples, chemistry has been of great service, but in later years,\r\nbacteriology has also been most successfully applied to the problems\r\nof modern dairying. Indeed, it may be said that the science of\r\ndairying, as related to the problems of dairy manufacture is, in\r\nlarge degree, dependent upon an understanding of bacteriological\r\nprinciples. It is therefore essential that the student of dairying,\r\neven though he is concerned in large measure with the practical\r\naspects of the subject, should acquire as complete an understanding\r\nof these principles as possible.\r\n\r\nWhile bacteriology is concerned primarily with the activities of\r\nthose microscopic forms of plant life known as the bacteria, yet the\r\ngeneral principles governing the life of this particular class of\r\norganisms are sufficiently similar to those governing the molds and\r\nother types of microscopic life that affect milk and its products to\r\nmake it possible to include all of these types in a general\r\nconsideration of the subject.\r\n\r\n=Nature of bacteria.= The vegetable kingdom to which the bacteria\r\nbelong consists of plants of the most varying size and nature. Those\r\nof most common acquaintance are the green plants varying in size\r\nfrom those not visible to the naked eye to the largest trees.\r\nAnother class of plants known as fungi or fungous plants do not\r\ncontain chlorophyll, the green coloring matter, but are usually\r\ncolorless and, as a rule, of small size; among them are included\r\nsuch forms as the mushrooms, smuts, rusts and mildews, as well as\r\nthe molds and yeasts. The bacteria are closely allied to this latter\r\nclass. When first discovered they were thought to be animals because\r\nof the ability of some forms to move about in liquids.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria, like other kinds of living organisms, possess a\r\ndefinite form and shape. They are the simplest in structure of all\r\nthe plants, the individual organism consisting of a single cell. The\r\nlarger and more highly organized forms of life are made up of many\r\nmicroscopic cells, and the life of the individual consists of the\r\nwork of all the cells. The bacteria are very comparable to the\r\nsingle cells of the higher plants and animals, but in the case of\r\nthe bacteria the single cell is able to exist apart from all other\r\ncells and to carry out all of its life processes including\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\n=Forms of bacteria.= With the multicellular organisms much variation\r\nin form is possible, but with these single-celled organisms the\r\npossible variation in form is greatly limited. Three well marked\r\ntypes occur among the bacteria: the round or coccus form (plural\r\ncocci); the rod-shaped or bacillus (plural bacilli); and the\r\ntwisted or spirillum type (plural spirilla). Most organisms of\r\nspecial significance in dairying belong to the coccus or bacillus\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n=Size of bacteria.= The bacteria, as a class, are among the smallest\r\nof living objects. None of them are individually visible to the\r\nnaked eye, and they can be so seen only when clumps or masses are\r\nformed in the process of growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Forms of Bacteria. A, coccus; B, bacillus;\r\nC, spirillum.]\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable relative variation in size, yet in\r\nactual dimensions, this difference is so small as to make careful\r\nmicroscopic determinations necessary. An average diameter may be\r\ntaken as about one thirty-thousandth of an inch, while the length\r\nvaries naturally several fold, depending upon whether the type under\r\nobservation is a coccus or a bacillus.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to conceive of the minuteness of the bacteria;\r\nthe following may give some idea of their size. In a drop of cream\r\nready for churning may be found as many as 10,000,000 and in a piece\r\nof fresh cheese as large as a cherry there may be as many living\r\nbacteria as there are people on our earth. While the bacteria are\r\nvery minute, the effect which they exert in milk and other dairy\r\nproducts is great on account of their enormous numbers.\r\n\r\n=Manner of growth.= The cells of which all plants and animals consist\r\nincrease in numbers by the division of each cell into two cells\r\nthrough the formation of a division wall across the cell. The new\r\ncells divide and the plant or animal continues to grow. The same\r\ncell division occurs in the bacteria but since the bacteria are\r\nsingle celled, division of the cells means an increase in numbers\r\nrather than growth as in the higher forms of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Division of Bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria increase in numbers by the division of each cell into\r\ntwo cells. (After Novy.)]\r\n\r\nIn the case of those bacteria that have a greater length than\r\ndiameter, the new wall is formed at right angles to the long axis of\r\nthe cell. As soon as the division is complete each cell is a\r\ncomplete individual, capable of carrying on all of its life\r\nprocesses. The cells may, however, cohere and thus form distinctive\r\ngroupings that may serve to identify certain types. Some of the\r\ncocci form long chains and the term _streptococcus_ is applied to\r\nsuch. Other groupings may be similar to a bale of twine or they may\r\nbe massed in clusters with no regularity distinguishable.\r\n\r\n=Spores.= Just as ordinary plants form resistant structures, known as\r\nseeds, capable of retaining vitality under conditions unfavorable\r\nfor growth thereby perpetuating the species, so with certain of the\r\nbacteria, definite structures, known as _spores_, that are analogous\r\nin some respects to the seeds of the higher plants, are produced\r\nwithin the mother cell. The spores are exceedingly resistant to the\r\ninfluence of an unfavorable environment, such as heat, cold, drying,\r\nand even chemical agents. It is this property of the spores which\r\nmakes it so difficult to destroy the bacterial life in the process\r\nof sterilizing milk. The property of spore-formation is fortunately\r\nconfined to a comparatively small number of different species of\r\nbacilli.\r\n\r\n=Movement.= Many of the bacteria are provided with vibratory organs of\r\nlocomotion, known as _cilia_ (singular cilium) which are variously\r\ndistributed on the surface of the cell. By the movement of these\r\nrelatively long, thread-like appendages the individual cell is able\r\nto move in liquids. It must be remembered, when these moving cells\r\nare observed under the microscope, that their apparent rate of\r\nmovement is magnified relatively as much as their size.\r\n\r\n=Conditions for growth.= All kinds of living things need certain\r\nconditions for growth such as food, moisture, air and a favorable\r\ntemperature. The bacteria prefer as food such organic matter as\r\nmilk, meat, and vegetable infusions. Those living on dead organic\r\nmatter are known as _saprophytes_, while those which are capable of\r\nthriving in the tissues of the living plant or animal are known as\r\n_parasites_. Certain of the parasitic forms are capable of causing\r\ndisease in plants and animals. In the first group are embraced most\r\nof the bacteria that are able to develop in milk or its products,\r\nsuch as those forms concerned in the spoiling of milk or its\r\nfermentation. It is true that milk may contain disease-producing\r\nbacteria coming either from a diseased animal or from a diseased\r\nhuman being. It is also true that some of such harmful forms are\r\nable to grow in milk, such as the organisms causing typhoid fever\r\nand diphtheria.\r\n\r\n=Food.= The bacteria like all other plants must have their food in\r\nsolution. Where they apparently live on solids, such as meats,\r\nfruits, etc., they dissolve the food substances before utilizing the\r\nsame. If the solutions are highly concentrated, as in the case of\r\nsyrups, preserves and condensed milk, the bacteria cannot readily\r\ngrow, although all of the necessary food ingredients are present.\r\nWhen such concentrated solutions are diluted, bacterial growth will\r\ntake place and the solutions will spoil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Photomicrograph of Lactic Acid Bacteria.\r\n\r\nEach cell is an individual organism, magnified 1250 diameters.]\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking the bacteria grow best in a neutral or slightly\r\nalkaline solution rather than in acid liquids.\r\n\r\n=Temperature.= One of the most important conditions influencing the\r\nrate of growth of bacteria is the temperature. Each form has a\r\n_minimum_ temperature below which growth can not take place; also a\r\n_maximum_ above which growth is again impossible. For the majority\r\nof species the minimum temperature ranges from 40 to 45° F. the\r\nmaximum from 105 to 110° F. Growth takes place most rapidly at the\r\noptimum temperature, which, for each species, lies close to the\r\nmaximum temperature at which growth can occur. Most of the bacteria\r\nof importance in the dairy grow well at from 70 to 100° F.\r\n\r\nThere are forms that can grow below the freezing point of water when\r\nthey are in solutions that do not freeze at this temperature. There\r\nare still other bacteria that can grow at 140° F. a temperature that\r\nis quickly fatal to most forms. These are of importance in the dairy\r\nsince they limit the temperatures at which milk can be stored for\r\nlong periods of time.\r\n\r\n=Air supply.= Living organisms, both plant and animal, require air or\r\noxygen for the combustion of their food and for the production of\r\nenergy. Most bacteria use, as do the green plants and animals, the\r\nfree oxygen of the air for their respiration. Such organisms are\r\ncalled _aerobic_ or air-living. A much smaller group possess the\r\npower of taking oxygen from organic compounds such as sugar and the\r\nlike and therefore are able to live under conditions where air is\r\nexcluded. These are called _anaerobic_ bacteria. A large number of\r\nbacteria are able to live either in the presence or in the absence\r\nof free oxygen. Most of the bacteria of importance in the dairy are\r\nof this nature.\r\n\r\n=Rate of growth.= When there is an abundant supply of food and when\r\nthe temperature conditions are favorable, the bacteria increase in\r\nnumbers with astounding rapidity. It has been determined by actual\r\nexperiment that the process of cell division under favorable\r\nconditions takes place in a few moments. Barber has shown that one\r\nof the forms of bacteria constantly found in milk will divide in 17\r\nminutes at 98° F. and that a single organism kept at this\r\ntemperature for ten hours would increase to 1,240,000,000. If the\r\ntemperature is reduced to 50° F., the time required for division is\r\nincreased to several hours. The explanation for the rapid spoiling\r\nof milk that is not well cooled is thus apparent. The initial rapid\r\nrate of increase cannot be maintained for any length of time as the\r\nconditions become more and more unfavorable as growth continues, due\r\nto the accumulation of the by-products of the cell activity. Thus,\r\nthe growth of acid-forming organisms in milk becomes checked by the\r\nformation of acid from the fermentation of the sugar.\r\n\r\n=Detrimental effect of external conditions.= Environmental conditions\r\nof a detrimental character are constantly at work tending to repress\r\nthe activity of bacteria or to destroy them. These act more readily\r\non the vegetating cells than on the more resistant spores. It is of\r\nthe utmost importance that those engaged in dairy work be familiar\r\nwith these antagonistic forces since it is constantly necessary to\r\nrepress or to kill outright the bacteria in milk and other dairy\r\nproducts. In many lines of dairy work it is likewise important to be\r\nfamiliar with the conditions favorable for bacterial growth.\r\n\r\n=Effect of cold.= While it is true that chilling largely prevents\r\nfermentative action, and actual freezing stops all growth processes,\r\nstill it does not follow that exposure to low temperatures will\r\neffectually destroy the vitality of bacteria, even in the growing\r\ncondition. Numerous non-spore-bearing species remain alive in ice\r\nfor a prolonged period, and experiments with liquid air show that\r\neven a temperature of-310° F. maintained for hours does not kill all\r\nexposed cells.\r\n\r\n=Effect of heat.= High temperatures, on the other hand, will destroy\r\nany form of life, whether in the vegetative or latent spore stage.\r\nThe temperature at which the vitality of the cell is lost is known\r\nas the _thermal death point_. This limit is dependent not only upon\r\nthe nature of the organism, but upon the time of exposure and the\r\ncondition in which the heat is applied. In a moist atmosphere, the\r\npenetrating power of heat is great, consequently cell death occurs\r\nat a lower temperature than in a dry atmosphere. An increase in time\r\nof exposure lowers the temperature point at which death occurs.\r\n\r\nFor growing organisms, the thermal death point of most species\r\nranges from 130° to 140° F. for ten minutes. When spores are\r\npresent, resistance is greatly increased, some forms being able to\r\nwithstand steam at 212° F. from one to three hours. In the\r\nsterilization of milk, it is often necessary to heat for several\r\nhours, where a single exposure is made, to destroy the resistant\r\nspores, that seem to be more abundant under summer than winter\r\nconditions. Steam under pressure is a much more effective agent, as\r\nthe temperature is thus raised considerably beyond 212° F. An\r\nexposure of twenty minutes, at a temperature of 230° to 240° F. will\r\nkill all spores. Where heat is used in a dry state, it is much less\r\neffective, a baking temperature of 260° to 300° F. for an hour being\r\nnecessary to kill spores. This condition is of the utmost importance\r\nin the destruction of bacteria in the dairy and creamery.\r\n\r\n=Effect of drying.= The spore-bearing bacteria withstand\r\neffects of desiccation without serious injury, and many of the\r\nnon-spore-producing types retain their vitality for some months. The\r\nbacteria found in the air are practically all derived from the soil,\r\nand exist in the air in a dried condition, in which they are able to\r\nremain alive for considerable periods of time. In a dried condition,\r\nactive cell growth is not possible, but when other conditions, such\r\nas moisture and food supply are present, resumption of growth\r\nquickly begins. This property is also of importance in the dairy as\r\nin the preparation of dry starters for creameries and cheese\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\n=Effect of light.= Bright sunlight exerts a markedly injurious effect\r\non bacterial life, both in a spore and in a growing condition. Where\r\nthe direct sunlight strikes, more or less complete disinfection\r\nresults in the course of a few hours, the effect being produced by\r\nthe chemical or violet rays, and not by the heat or red rays of the\r\nspectrum. This action, however, does not penetrate opaque objects,\r\nand is therefore confined to the surface. In diffused light, the\r\neffect is much lessened, although it is exerted to some extent.\r\nSunlight exerts a beneficial effect on the general health and\r\nwell-being of animal life, and is a matter of importance to be taken\r\ninto consideration in the erection of buildings for animals as well\r\nas for people.\r\n\r\n=Effect of chemicals.= A great many chemical substances exert a more\r\nor less powerful toxic action on various kinds of life. Many of\r\nthese are of great service in destroying bacteria or holding them in\r\ncheck. Those that are toxic and result in the death of the cell are\r\nknown as _disinfectants_; those that merely inhibit, or retard\r\ngrowth are known as _antiseptics_. All disinfectants must of\r\nnecessity be antiseptic in their action, but not all antiseptics are\r\ndisinfectants, even when used in large amounts. Disinfectants have\r\nno place in dairy work, except to destroy disease-producing\r\nbacteria, or to preserve milk for analytical purposes. The so-called\r\nchemical preservatives used to \"keep\" milk depend for their effect\r\non the inhibition of bacterial growth. In this country, most states\r\nprohibit the use of these substances in milk. Their only function in\r\nthe dairy should be to check fermentative and putrefactive processes\r\noutside of milk and so keep the air free from taints.\r\n\r\n=Products of growth.= All bacteria, as a result of their growth in\r\nfood substances, form more or less characteristic compounds that are\r\nknown as _by-products_. The changes brought about are those of\r\ndecomposition and are collectively known as _fermentations_; they\r\nare characterized by the production of a large amount of by-products\r\nas the result of the development of a relatively small amount of\r\ncell life. The souring of milk, the rotting of eggs, the spoiling of\r\nmeats, the making of vinegar from cider are examples of\r\nfermentations caused by different bacteria.\r\n\r\nIf the substances decomposed contain but little sugar, as do animal\r\ntissues, the conditions are favorable for the growth of the\r\nputrefactive bacteria, and foul-smelling gases are formed. When\r\nsugars are present, as in milk, the environmental conditions are\r\nmost favorable for the acid-forming bacteria that do not as a rule\r\nproduce offensive odors.\r\n\r\nMany of the bacteria form substances known as enzymes which are able\r\nto produce certain decomposition changes in the absence of the\r\nliving cells, and it is by virtue of these enzymes that the\r\norganisms are able to break down such enormous quantities of\r\norganic matter. Most of these enzymes react toward heat, cold,\r\nand chemical poisons in a manner quite similar to the living\r\ncells. In one respect, they are readily differentiated, and that\r\nis, that practically all of them are capable of producing their\r\ncharacteristic chemical transformations under conditions where the\r\nactivity of the cell is wholly suspended as in a saturated ether or\r\nchloroform atmosphere. The production of enzymes is not confined to\r\nbacteria, but they are found throughout the animal and plant world,\r\nespecially in those processes that are concerned in digestion.\r\nRennet, used in cheese making, is an example of an animal enzyme.\r\n\r\n=Distribution of bacteria.= As bacteria possess greater powers of\r\nresistance than almost any other form of life, they are found very\r\nwidely distributed over the surface of the earth. In soil they are\r\nabundant, because of the fact that all of the conditions necessary\r\nfor growth are here best satisfied. They are, however, distributed\r\nwith reference to the layers of the soil; the soil proper, i.e.,\r\nthat turned over by the plow, is extremely rich in them on account\r\nof the abundance of organic matter. But at the depth of a few feet\r\nthey decrease rapidly in numbers, and in the deeper layers, from six\r\nto ten feet, or more, they are normally not present, because of the\r\nlack of proper food supply and oxygen. The fertility of the soil is\r\nclosely associated with their presence.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria are found in the air because of their development in\r\nthe soil below. They are unable to grow even in a moist atmosphere,\r\nbut are so readily dislodged by wind currents from the soil that\r\nover land areas the lower strata of the air always contain them.\r\nThey are more numerous in summer than in winter; city air contains\r\nlarger numbers than country air. Wherever dried fecal matter is\r\npresent, as in barns, the air contains many forms.\r\n\r\nWater generally contains enough organic matter in solution, so that\r\ncertain types of bacterial life find favorable growth conditions.\r\nWater in contact with the soil surface takes up many impurities, and\r\nis of necessity rich in bacteria. As the rain water percolates into\r\nthe soil, it loses its germ content, so that the normal ground\r\nwater, like the deeper soil layers, contains practically no\r\nbacterial life. Springs, therefore, are relatively deficient in germ\r\nlife, except as they become contaminated with soil organisms, as the\r\nwater issues from the ground. Wells vary in their germ content,\r\ndepending upon manner of construction, ease of contamination at\r\nsurface, etc. Wells are too frequently insufficiently protected from\r\nsurface leachings, and consequently may contain all kinds of\r\norganisms found in the surface soil. Typhoid fever is very\r\nfrequently disseminated in this way, as is cholera and a number of\r\nanimal maladies.\r\n\r\nWhile the inner tissues of healthy animals are free from bacteria,\r\nthe natural passages, as the respiratory and digestive tracts, being\r\nin more direct contact with the exterior, become readily infected.\r\nThis is particularly true with reference to the intestinal tract,\r\nand in the undigested residue of the food, bacterial activity is at\r\na maximum. The result is that fecal matter of all kinds contains\r\nenormous numbers of organisms so that the pollution of any food\r\nmedium, such as milk, with such material is sure to introduce\r\nelements that seriously affect its quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF STUDYING BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Necessity of artificial cultivation.= The bacteria are so extremely\r\nsmall, that it is impossible to study individual germs separately\r\nwithout the aid of powerful microscopes. Little advance was made in\r\nthe knowledge of these lower forms of plant life until the\r\nintroduction of culture methods, whereby a single organism could be\r\ncultivated, and the progeny of this cell increased to such an extent\r\nin a short course of time that the resulting mass of cells would be\r\nvisible to the unaided eye. This is done by growing the bacteria on\r\nvarious kinds of nutrient media that are prepared for the purpose,\r\nbut inasmuch as bacteria are so universally distributed, it becomes\r\nan impossibility to cultivate any special form alone, unless the\r\nmedium in which they are grown is first freed from all pre-existing\r\nforms of germ life.\r\n\r\n=Food materials.= Many kinds of food substances are used for the\r\ncultivation of bacteria in the laboratory. In fact, bacteria will\r\ngrow on almost any organic substance, whether it is solid or liquid,\r\nprovided the other essential conditions of growth are furnished. The\r\nfood substances that are used for culture purposes are divided into\r\ntwo classes,--solids and liquids.\r\n\r\nSolid culture media may be either permanently solid, like potatoes\r\nand coagulated egg, or they may retain their solid properties only\r\nat certain temperatures, like gelatin or agar. The latter two, which\r\nwere devised by Robert Koch, are of utmost importance in\r\nbacteriological research, for their use permits the separation of\r\nthe different forms of bacteria that may happen to be in any\r\nmixture. Gelatin is advantageously used, because the majority of\r\nbacteria present wider differences, due to growth upon this medium,\r\nthan upon any other. It remains solid at ordinary temperatures,\r\nbecoming liquid at about 80° F. Agar, a gelatinous product derived\r\nfrom a Japanese seaweed, has a much higher melting point, and is\r\nused especially with those organisms whose optimum temperature for\r\ngrowth is above the melting point of gelatin.\r\n\r\nBesides these solid culture media, different liquid substances are\r\nextensively used, such as beef broth, milk and infusions of various\r\nvegetable and animal tissues. Skim milk is of especial value in\r\nstudying the milk bacteria, and may be used in its natural\r\ncondition, or a few drops of litmus solution may be added, in order\r\nto detect any change in its chemical reaction due to the bacteria.\r\n\r\n=Sterilization.= The various ingredients that are used in the\r\npreparation of culture media are not free from micro-organisms,\r\nhence the media would soon spoil if they were not destroyed, and the\r\nmedia subsequently protected from contamination from the air, etc.\r\nThe process of rendering the media free from living micro-organisms\r\nis known as _sterilization_. It may be accomplished in a number of\r\nways, but most often is done by the use of heat. For culture\r\nmaterial, which is always organic in character, moist heat is\r\nemployed. The various culture media, in appropriate containers, are\r\nsubjected to a thorough steaming in a steam cooker. This destroys\r\nall of the vegetating cells but not the resistant spores that may be\r\npresent. The media are then stored, for twenty-four hours, at\r\ntemperatures favorable for the germination of the spores and are\r\nthen again heated. Three such applications on successive days are\r\nusually sufficient to free the media from all living germs, since\r\nbetween the heating periods the spores germinate and the resulting\r\nvegetative cells are more easily destroyed. The sterile media will\r\nkeep for an indefinite period in a moist place.\r\n\r\nThe media are usually placed in glass containers which may be\r\nsterilized before use by heating them in an oven, it being possible\r\nto thus secure a much higher temperature than with streaming steam.\r\nAll glass or metal articles may be sterilized by the use of dry heat\r\nbut for organic media, to avoid burning, moist heat must be used.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of materials may be sterilized by treatment with steam\r\nunder pressure. An exposure for a few moments at 250° F., a\r\ntemperature attained with 15 pounds steam pressure, will destroy all\r\nkinds of bacteria and their spores. This method of sterilization is\r\nused in the canning of meats and vegetables and in the preparation\r\nof evaporated milk. To avoid contamination of the media after\r\nsterilization, the flasks and tubes are, after being filled,\r\nstoppered with plugs of cotton-wool, which effectually filter out\r\nall bacteria and mold spores from the air, and yet allow the air to\r\npass freely in and out of the containers.\r\n\r\n=Methods of determining the number of bacteria.= The method of\r\ndetermining the number and kinds of bacteria in any substance can be\r\nillustrated by the process as applied to milk. For this purpose the\r\nmethod of procedure is as follows: Sterile gelatin in glass tubes is\r\nmelted and then cooled until it is barely warm. To this melted\r\ngelatin a definite quantity of milk is added. The medium is gently\r\nshaken, so as to thoroughly mix the milk and gelatine, and the\r\nmixture then poured into a sterile, flat, glass dish, and quickly\r\ncovered, where it is allowed to cool until the gelatin hardens.\r\nAfter the culture plate has been left for twenty-four to thirty-six\r\nhours at the proper temperature, tiny spots will begin to appear on\r\nthe surface, or in the depth of the culture-medium. These spots are\r\ncalled _colonies_, and are composed of an almost infinite number of\r\nindividual cells, the result of the continued growth of a single\r\norganism that was in the drop of milk and which was firmly held in\r\nplace when the gelatin solidified. The number of these colonies\r\nrepresents approximately the number of living bacteria that were\r\npresent in the amount of milk added to the tube of gelatin. If the\r\nplate is not too thickly sown with the bacteria, the colonies will\r\ncontinue to grow and increase in size, and as they do, minute\r\ndifferences will begin to appear. These differences may be in the\r\ncolor, the contour, and the texture of the colony, or the manner in\r\nwhich it acts toward gelatin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Plate Culture.\r\n\r\nEach of the dots is a colony that has been formed by the growth of\r\nan organism embedded in the solid culture-medium. By counting the\r\ncolonies, the number of living bacteria in the amount of milk added\r\nto the culture is determined.]\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure that the number of colonies is not so numerous\r\nas to prevent counting and further study of their characteristics, a\r\nseries of plate cultures is usually made in which varying amounts of\r\nmilk are added to the tubes of gelatine. This is attained by adding\r\na definite amount of the milk or other substance to be examined to a\r\nmeasured amount of sterile water, e.g., one cubic centimeter of milk\r\nto ninety-nine cubic centimeters of water. One cubic centimeter of\r\nthis mixture may be used for the inoculation of the plate culture.\r\nThis dilution may be carried on to any desired extent; in the\r\nexamination of many dairy products, it is necessary to use very\r\nminute quantities of material, often only one one-millionth of a\r\ncubic centimeter.\r\n\r\nTo study further the peculiarities of the different bacteria, small\r\nportions of the individual colonies are transferred to tubes of\r\nsterile culture-media. In order to do this the colony is touched\r\nwith a piece of platinum wire; the minute amount of growth that\r\nadheres to the wire is sufficient to seed the tube of fresh\r\nculture-medium. The inoculating needle must always be sterilized\r\nbefore use by passing it through a gas flame.\r\n\r\nA culture thus obtained is called a _pure culture_ since it contains\r\nbut a single kind of an organism, as the colony is the result of the\r\ngrowth of a single cell. These cultures then serve as a basis for\r\ncontinued study, and must be planted and grown upon the different\r\nkinds of media that are obtainable. In this way the slightest\r\nvariations in the growth of different forms are detected, and the\r\npeculiar characteristics are determined, so that the student is able\r\nto recognize this form when he meets it again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Different Kinds of Bacteria Growing in\r\nGelatin.\r\n\r\nA, meager growth, no liquefaction or surface growth; B, profuse\r\nsurface growth, radiating filaments from the growth below the\r\nsurface; C, a rapid liquefying form; D, a gas producer that grows\r\nequally well in the presence or absence of air; E, form that grows\r\nonly in the absence of air, an anaerob.]\r\n\r\nThese culture methods are of essential importance in bacteriology,\r\nas it is the only way in which it is possible to secure a quantity\r\nof germs in a pure state.\r\n\r\n=The microscope in bacterial investigations.= In order to verify the\r\npurity of the cultures, the microscope is in constant demand\r\nthroughout all the different stages of the isolating process. For\r\nthis purpose it is essential that the instrument used shall be one\r\nof high magnifying powers (600 to 800 diameters), combined with\r\nsharp definition.\r\n\r\nThe microscopical examination of any germ is quite as essential as\r\nthe determination of culture characteristics, in fact, the two must\r\ngo hand in hand. The examination reveals not only the form and size\r\nof the individual germs but the manner in which they are united with\r\neach other, as well as any peculiarities of movement that they may\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the microscopical part of the work, not only is the\r\norganism examined in a living condition, but colored preparations\r\nare made by using solutions of anilin dyes as staining agents. These\r\nare of great service in bringing out almost imperceptible\r\ndifferences. The art of staining has been carried to the highest\r\ndegree of perfection in bacteriology, especially in the detection of\r\ngerms that are found in diseased tissues in the animal or human\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nIn studying the peculiarities of any special organism, not only is\r\nit necessary that these cultural and microscopical characters should\r\nbe closely observed, but special experiments must be made in\r\ndifferent ways, in order to determine any special properties that\r\nthe germ may possess. Thus, the ability of any form to act as a\r\nfermentative organism can be tested by fermentation experiments; the\r\nproperty of causing disease, studied by the inoculation of pure\r\ncultures into experimental animals, like rabbits, guinea pigs and\r\nwhite mice.\r\n\r\nThe methods of the bacteriologist in his laboratory are in their\r\neffect not dissimilar to those which the farmer employs in securing\r\nhis crop of pure-bred grain. The laboratory farmer kills the weed\r\nseeds in his culture field by the application of heat. His field,\r\nwhich is embraced in his culture dish, has been fertilized and\r\nprepared by the addition of certain favorable ingredients. When he\r\nhas garnered his crop, he maintains its purity by keeping his\r\nselected seed, the pure culture, free from all contamination. The\r\ndairyman, even though he may not expect to carry on the detailed\r\noperations of the laboratory, will understand the reason for the\r\ndirections which he is often required to follow much better if he\r\nknows how the simple operations of the laboratory are carried out.\r\nFor a fuller knowledge of these matters, the reader is referred to\r\nthe special texts on bacteriology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCONTAMINATION OF MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spoiling of milk.= Materials of animal origin are peculiarly prone to\r\nundergo changes, rendering them unfit for use, and of these, milk is\r\nexceedingly susceptible to such changes. This is due to the fact\r\nthat the composition of milk is especially adapted to bacterial\r\ngrowth, and that the opportunity for entrance of such organisms is\r\nlikewise such as to permit of abundant contamination. The\r\nconsequence is that milk readily undergoes fermentative changes, due\r\nto the development of one or another type of micro-organism.\r\n\r\n=Milk, a suitable bacterial food.= While milk is designed by nature\r\nfor the nourishment of mammalian life, it is, curiously enough,\r\nequally well adapted to the growth of these lowest forms of\r\nvegetable life. The nutritive substances required by bacteria are\r\nhere sufficiently dilute to make possible rapid growth.\r\n\r\nMilk also contains all the necessary chemical substances to make a\r\nsuitable bacterial food supply. Of the nitrogenous compounds,\r\nalbumen is in a readily assimilable form. Casein, the principal\r\nnitrogenous constituent of milk, exists in an insoluble condition,\r\nand cannot be directly utilized, until it is acted upon by digesting\r\nenzymes. The fat in milk does not readily decompose, and while there\r\nare a few bacteria capable of splitting this substance, the majority\r\nof organisms are unable to utilize it. Milk sugar, on the other\r\nhand, is an excellent food for most species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Fat Globules and Bacteria.\r\n\r\nNote the relative size of the fat globules of milk and the lactic\r\nacid bacteria.]\r\n\r\n=Sources of contamination.= Inasmuch as milk is especially exposed to\r\nthe inroads of bacterial growth, and because of the fact that much\r\nof the contamination can easily be prevented, it is highly important\r\nthat the milk producer and dealer should be thoroughly cognizant of\r\nthe various sources of contamination. The different factors\r\nconcerned in contamination may be grouped as follows: the interior\r\nof the udder; utensils, including all apparatus with which the milk\r\nis brought in contact subsequent to withdrawal from the animal;\r\ninfection coming from the animal herself, from the milker, and the\r\nsurrounding air.\r\n\r\n=Condition of milk when secreted.= Immediately after withdrawal from\r\nthe udder, milk always contains bacteria, yet in the secreting\r\ncells of the udder of a healthy cow, germ life does not seem to be\r\npresent. Only when the gland is diseased are bacteria found in any\r\nabundance. In the passage of the milk from the secreting cells to\r\nthe outside, it receives its first infection, so that when drawn\r\nfrom the animal it generally contains a considerable number of\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nA study of the structure of the udder shows the manner in which such\r\ninfection occurs.\r\n\r\n=Structure of the udder.= The udder is composed of secreting tissue\r\n(_gland cells_) that is supported by fibrous connective tissue. The\r\nmilk is elaborated in these cells and is discharged into microscopic\r\ncavities, from whence it flows through the numerous channels (_milk\r\nsinuses_) that ramify through the substance of the udder, until\r\nfinally it is conveyed into the _milk cistern_, a common receptacle\r\nholding about one half pint that is located just above the teat.\r\nThis cavity is connected with the outside by a direct opening (_milk\r\nduct_) through the teat. During the process of milking, the milk is\r\nelaborated rapidly in the gland cells, and their contents upon\r\nrupture of the milk cells, flow down into the cistern. The normal\r\ncontraction of the muscles at the lower opening of the outer duct\r\nprevents the milk from passing out except when pressure is applied,\r\nas in milking. The inner walls of the milk duct and cistern are\r\nalways more or less moist, and therefore afford a suitable place for\r\nbacteria to develop, if infection once occurs, and conditions are\r\nfavorable for growth.\r\n\r\n=Manner of invasion.= Two possible sources of invasion of the udder by\r\nbacteria may exist. If bacteria are present in the circulating\r\nblood, there is the possibility of organisms passing directly\r\nthrough the tissues into the milk-secreting cells. The other\r\nalternative is the possible direct contamination from the outside by\r\norganisms passing up through the milk duct, and so spreading through\r\nthe open channels in the udder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Sectional View of Udder.\r\n\r\nTeat with milk duct connecting the exterior with the milk cistern.\r\nMilk sinuses which conduct the milk from the secreting tissue to the\r\nmilk cistern. (After Moore & Ward.)]\r\n\r\n=Number of bacteria in fore-milk.= If a bacteriological examination is\r\nmade of the milk drawn from each teat at different periods during\r\nthe milking process, it will be found that the fore-milk, _i.e._,\r\nthe first few streams, contains, as a rule, many more organisms per\r\ncubic centimeter than that removed later. Not infrequently thousands\r\nof organisms per cubic centimeter may be found in the first streams\r\nwhile the middle milk, or strippings, will contain much smaller\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n=Distribution and nature of bacteria in udder.= If the udder itself is\r\ncarefully examined as to its bacterial content, it appears that the\r\nmajority of organisms found is confined to the lower portion of this\r\norgan, in the teat, milk-cistern and large milk-ducts; while\r\nbacteria occur in contact with the secreting tissue, they are\r\nrelatively less abundant. This would seem to indicate that the more\r\nprobable mode of infection is through the open teat.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no constant type of bacteria found in the fore-milk,\r\nyet it is noteworthy that nearly all observers agree that the\r\norganisms most commonly found are not usually the acid-producing, or\r\ngas-generating type, so abundant on the skin or hairy coat of the\r\nudder and which predominate in ordinary milks. Coccus forms,\r\nbelonging to both liquefying and non-liquefying types are most\r\ngenerally present. Many of these produce acid slowly and in small\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria coming from the interior of the udder are of small\r\npractical significance since they do not grow rapidly at the\r\ntemperatures at which milk is stored. If the milk is protected from\r\ncontamination from other sources, the bacteria from the udder will\r\nultimately cause it to spoil, but under ordinary conditions other\r\nforms are present in such greater numbers, and grow so much more\r\nrapidly in milk, that the udder forms have small opportunity to\r\nexert any effect.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the bacteria found in the udder are\r\nsimilar to those that seem to be most abundant in such glandular\r\ntissues as the liver and spleen. This fact increases the probability\r\nthat these comparatively inert coccus forms of the udder may\r\noriginate directly from the blood stream. The organisms that\r\nnormally are found in the udder exert no harmful effects on the\r\ngland. It might be thought that due to the presence of abundant food\r\nand a favorable temperature that growth would be abundant, but such\r\nis not the case. At times the udder may be invaded by forms that are\r\nnot held in check by the natural factors and an inflammation of the\r\nudder is likely to result.\r\n\r\n=Germicidal property of milk.= It has been claimed that freshly drawn\r\nmilk, like other body fluids, possesses germicidal properties,\r\n_i.e._, the power of destroying bacteria with which it may be\r\nbrought in contact. If milk is carefully examined bacteriologically,\r\nhour by hour, after it is withdrawn from the udder, it will\r\ngenerally be found that there is at first not only no increase in\r\nnumber of organisms during a longer or shorter period when it is\r\nkept at temperatures varying from 40° to 70° F., but that an actual\r\nreduction not infrequently takes place. When cultures of bacteria,\r\nsuch as _B. prodigiosus_, a red organism, lactic acid organisms, and\r\neven the yellow, liquefying coccus, so commonly found in the\r\nfore-milk, are artificially introduced into the udder, it has been\r\nfound that no growth occurs and that in the course of a few days the\r\nintroduced organisms actually disappear. Whether this failure to\r\ncolonize can be regarded as evidence of a germicidal property or not\r\nis questionable. In fact, this question is a matter of but little\r\npractical importance in the handling of milk since, under the best\r\nof conditions, the keeping quality of the milk is not materially\r\nenhanced. It may be of importance in inhibiting growth in the udder.\r\n\r\n=Rejection of fore-milk.= The fact that the fore-milk contains per\r\ncubic centimeter so much more germ life than the remainder of the\r\nmilk has led some to advocate its rejection when a sanitary milk\r\nsupply is under consideration. While from a purely quantitative\r\npoint of view, this custom may be considered advantageous, in\r\npractice, however, it is hardly worth while since it is not at all\r\ncertain that the rejection will have any effect on the keeping\r\nquality or healthfulness of milk. This is especially true if the\r\nends of the teats are thoroughly cleaned before milking. It is true\r\nthat the fore-milk is relatively deficient in fat so that the loss\r\nof butter fat occasioned by the rejection of the first few streams\r\nis comparatively slight.\r\n\r\n=Contamination from utensils.= One of the most important phases of\r\ncontamination is that which comes from the utensils used to hold the\r\nmilk from the time it is drawn until it is utilized. Not only is\r\nthis important because it is a leading factor in the infection of\r\nmilk, but because much improvement can be secured with but little\r\ntrouble, and it is especially necessary that the dairy student\r\nshould be made familiar with the various conditions that obtain.\r\nPails and cans used to hold milk may be apparently clean to the eye,\r\nand yet contribute materially to the germ content of the milk placed\r\nin them. Not only does much depend upon their condition, but it is\r\nequally important to take into consideration their manner of\r\nconstruction. Dairy utensils should be simple in construction,\r\nrather than complex. They should be made so that they can be readily\r\nand easily cleaned, or otherwise the cleaning process is apt to be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nOf first importance are those utensils that are used to collect the\r\nmilk and in which it is handled while on the farm. The warm milk is\r\nfirst received in pails, and unless these are scrupulously cleaned,\r\nan important initial contamination then occurs. As ordinarily\r\nwashed, the process falls far short of ridding the utensils of the\r\nbacterial life that is adherent to the inner surface of the pail.\r\nThen, too, all angles or crevices afford an excellent hiding place\r\nfor bacteria, and it is very important to see that all seams are\r\nwell soldered. Round corners and angles flushed with solder greatly\r\nfacilitate thorough cleaning of utensils. Tin utensils are\r\nrecognized as most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nShipping cans are likely to serve as greater infecting agents than\r\npails for they are subject to more wear and tear and are harder to\r\nclean. As long as the surface is bright and smooth, it may be easily\r\ncleaned, but large utensils, such as cans, are likely to become\r\ndented and rusty in spots on the inner side. The storage of milk in\r\nsuch utensils results in its rapid deterioration. The action of\r\nrennet has been found to be greatly retarded where milk comes in\r\ncontact with a rusty iron surface. It is also probable that some of\r\nthe abnormal flavors in butter are due to the action of acid cream\r\non iron or copper surfaces from which the tin has been worn. It is\r\nequally important that attention be paid to the care of strainers,\r\ncoolers, and the small utensils. Cloth strainers are more or less of\r\na hotbed for bacterial growth, for unless they are boiled, and then\r\ndried quickly and thoroughly, germ growth will continue apace in\r\nthem, as long as they contain any moisture.\r\n\r\n=Milking machines and farm separators.= The introduction of these\r\nspecial types of dairy machinery in the handling of milk on the farm\r\nhas materially complicated the question of the care of milk. Both of\r\nthese types of apparatus are much more complicated than the usual\r\nmilk utensil; consequently, the danger of imperfect cleaning is\r\nthereby increased. This is still further accentuated by the fact\r\nthat cleansing of utensils on the farm can never be done so well as\r\nat the factory or milk depot where steam is available. The milking\r\nmachine may be easily kept in a comparatively germ-free condition,\r\nbut unless this is done, it contributes its quota of germ life to\r\nthe milk.\r\n\r\nThe farm separator is more widely used than the milking machine and\r\nin actual practice the grossest carelessness prevails in the matter\r\nof its care. Frequently it is not taken apart and thoroughly\r\ncleansed, but is rinsed out by passing water through the machine. It\r\nis impossible by such a treatment to remove the slime that collects\r\non the wall of the bowl; the machine remains moist and bacterial\r\ngrowth can go on. Such a machine represents a most important source\r\nof contamination of milk and cream and it is probable that the\r\nwidespread introduction of the hand separator has contributed more\r\nto lower the quality of cream delivered at the factory than any\r\nother single factor.\r\n\r\n=Contamination from factory by-products.= The custom of returning\r\nfactory by-products in the same set of cans that is used to bring\r\nfresh milk is a prominent cause of bad milk. Whey and skim milk are\r\nrich in bacterial life, and not infrequently are so handled as to\r\nbecome a foul, fermenting mass. If the cans used to transport this\r\nmaterial are not scrupulously cleaned on the farm, transfer of\r\nharmful bacteria to the milk is made possible. In this way the\r\ncarelessness of a single patron may be the means of seeding the\r\nwhole factory supply. This custom is not only liable to produce a\r\npoor quality of milk, but it is more or less of a menace to all the\r\npatrons of a factory, inasmuch as the opportunity always obtains\r\nthat disease-producing organisms may thus be introduced into the\r\nsupply. Not infrequently is tuberculosis thus spread through the\r\nmedium of factory by-products.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Whey Disposal.\r\n\r\nWhey barrels at a Wisconsin Swiss cheese factory. Each patron's\r\nshare is placed in a barrel which is so situated that it is\r\nimpossible to empty it completely; thus it is not cleaned during the\r\nseason.]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of Swiss cheese presents a striking example of the\r\ndisregard which factory operators show toward the employment of\r\nbacteriological principles. In these factories, the custom is widely\r\npracticed of apportioning the patrons' allotment of whey into\r\nindividual barrels which are supposed to be emptied each day. As\r\nthese barrels are, however, rarely ever cleaned from the beginning\r\nto the end of the season, they become very foul, and the whey placed\r\nin them from day to day highly polluted. It is this material which\r\nis taken back to the farms in the same set of cans that is used for\r\nthe fresh milk. When one recalls that the very best type of milk is\r\nessential for the making of a prime quality of Swiss cheese, and\r\nthat to secure such, the maker insists that the patron bring the\r\nproduct to the factory twice daily, the before mentioned practice\r\nappears somewhat inconsistent.\r\n\r\n=Treatment of factory by-products.= To overcome the danger of\r\ninfecting milk from factory by-products with either undesirable\r\nfermentative organisms, or disease-producing bacteria, the most\r\nfeasible process is to destroy these organisms by the application of\r\nheat. In Denmark, some portions of Germany, and in some of the\r\nstates in this country, laws exist which require the heating of all\r\nskim milk before it is returned to the farm. This is done by the\r\ndirect use of exhaust steam, or running the product through heaters.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of whey in cheese factory practice is especially\r\nimportant since the warm whey must be stored for a number of hours\r\nbefore it is returned to the farms. Even under the best of\r\nconditions the whey is certain to be in an advanced state of\r\nfermentation when placed in the milk cans, and it only needs the\r\ninfection of the whey tank with harmful bacteria to cause great loss\r\non account of the injury of the product by these bacteria. Among\r\nCanadian factories the custom of heating the whey as it passes from\r\nthe cheese vat to whey tank has been introduced, and where ever\r\nadopted has been retained, because, it has resulted in such an\r\nimprovement of the cheese that the gain was much greater than the\r\ncost, which is estimated at not over fifty cents per ton of cheese.\r\nThe whey is heated not to exceed 155° F.; the hot whey serves to\r\nscald the whey tank and as the mass of whey is usually quite large,\r\nit does not cool to a point where bacterial growth can take place\r\nfor a number of hours. The whey is thus quite sweet when returned to\r\nthe farm and has greater feeding value. The heating also prevents\r\nthe creaming of the whey in the tank and thus avoids the soiling of\r\nthe cans with grease which is most difficult to remove.\r\n\r\nWhere compulsory legislation is in force it is generally required\r\nthat these by-products be heated to a temperature of at least 176°\r\nF. This is done so as to destroy effectually the organisms of\r\ntuberculosis, and especially to permit of the utilization of the\r\nso-called Storch test,[1] which enables a person to determine\r\nquickly whether milk or whey has been heated or not.\r\n\r\n    [1] Storch (40 Rept. Expt. Stat., Copenhagen, 1898) has devised\r\n    a test whereby it can be determined whether this treatment has\r\n    been carried out or not; milk contains a soluble enzyme known as\r\n    peroxidase which has the property of decomposing hydrogen\r\n    peroxid. If milk is heated to 176° F., (80° C.) or above, this\r\n    enzyme is destroyed, so that the above reaction no longer takes\r\n    place. If potassium iodide and starch are added to unheated milk\r\n    and the same treated with hydrogen peroxid, the decomposition of\r\n    the latter agent releases oxygen which acts on the potassium\r\n    salt, which in turn gives off free iodine that turns the starch\r\n    blue.\r\n\r\n=Cleaning utensils.= Various processes are applied to dairy utensils\r\nto cleanse them. In removing visible dirt and foreign matter, much\r\nof the bacterial life is mechanically eliminated, but most of the\r\ncleaning processes fail to destroy the germ life in these utensils.\r\n\r\nIn rinsing, washing, or even scalding, the water is not applied at a\r\nsufficiently high temperature to destroy effectively the bacteria.\r\nThese processes are primarily used for the removal of dirt and other\r\nmatter. To facilitate such removal, washing powders of various kinds\r\nare frequently employed; some of these possess considerable\r\ndisinfecting action. All utensils after cleansing should be\r\nthoroughly rinsed in clean, hot water. Even where no further\r\ntreatment is given, a careful cleaning may so reduce the germ\r\ncontent on the inner surface of utensil as to render contamination\r\ntherefrom relatively unimportant. Most of the contamination in a\r\nwell cleaned utensil comes from the cracks and angles, which permit\r\nof the collection of the dirt. If these are properly attended to,\r\nthorough cleaning and rinsing alone will accomplish much.\r\n\r\nTo exert an actual germ-destroying effect on the bacterial content\r\nof the utensil, resort must be had to boiling or steaming. To treat\r\nutensils so as to render them wholly germ-free would be impractical\r\nunder ordinary commercial conditions, as it would consume too much\r\ntime, although with proper apparatus, this process is not\r\nimpossible, but it is well within the limits of practicability in\r\nfactory treatment to apply steam for a short period of time. Where\r\ncans, pails and such utensils, are steamed for a minute or so after\r\nbeing thoroughly cleaned, the germ content is greatly reduced. In a\r\nseries of tests by Harrison, the germ content of a set of cans\r\ncleaned in an ordinary way was 442,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter\r\nin 100 cubic centimeters of wash water; in a set washed in tepid\r\nwater and then scalded--the best farm practice--it was 54,000 per\r\ncubic centimeter, while in cans carefully washed and then steamed\r\nfor 5 minutes, it was reduced to 880 per cubic centimeter. It would\r\nnot be worth while to institute measures that would accomplish the\r\ndestruction of this small residual content.\r\n\r\nThe use of steam, therefore, is of great service in eliminating\r\nbacterial life in all utensils. In apparatus of at all complicated\r\ndesign, it is absolutely necessary. Of course, ordinarily, steam can\r\nbe applied only at the factory, as the farm does not usually afford\r\nfacilities for its easy generation. This fact has led in some cases\r\nto the adoption of the method of cleaning and sterilizing the cans\r\nat the factory rather than to await their arrival at the farm. This\r\ncustom is most frequently followed in milk supply plants.\r\n\r\nIt is also very important in cleaning dairy utensils to see that\r\nthey are rapidly and thoroughly dried after being washed and\r\nsteamed. As pointed out above, the short period of steaming that can\r\nbe followed in practice does not kill all the bacteria. If moisture\r\nis retained, conditions permit of the growth of the undestroyed\r\norganisms. Tests made on glass milk bottles showed that considerable\r\ngrowth occurred in the condensation water even after quite thorough\r\nsterilization. Some of the devices used for the sterilization of\r\nsuch utensils as milk cans are so arranged that, after steam has\r\nbeen introduced, hot air is passed into the can until it is\r\nthoroughly dried. Other utensils such as cloth strainers become\r\nsources of contamination unless the articles are thoroughly and\r\nquickly dried after cleaning.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, it may be said that whenever a utensil is so\r\nconstructed and in such a condition that every portion of its\r\nsurface can be reached by a cloth or a brush, it can be kept in a\r\nsanitary condition. But whenever any portion cannot be thus reached,\r\nwhether it is an angle or a seam in a pail or can, the interior of\r\nthe separator bowl, or in the pipes used for conducting milk,\r\ncontamination is certain to result from such places, unless extreme\r\ncare is taken to destroy the bacteria therein by steaming.\r\n\r\n=Contamination from the animal.= In the process of milking, the\r\nbacterial content of the milk is materially increased. In part this\r\ncomes from the utensils into which the milk is drawn, but the animal\r\nherself, the milker, as well as the surrounding air, also contribute\r\nto a varying extent. Of these factors, the one fraught by far with\r\nthe most consequence, is the influence of the animal herself. It is\r\na popular belief that the organisms found in milk are derived from\r\nthe feed and water which the animal consumes, but under normal\r\nconditions, the bacteria consumed in food pass through the\r\nintestinal canal and do not appear in the circulation. It must not\r\nbe assumed, however, that the character of feed and water supply is\r\nof no moment. Stock should be given pure and wholesome water and no\r\ndecomposed or spoiled food should be used.\r\n\r\nThe infection traceable directly to the cow is modified materially\r\nby the conditions under which the animal is kept and the character\r\nof the feed consumed. The nature of the fecal matter is in part\r\ndependent upon the character of the food. The more nitrogenous the\r\nration fed, the softer are the fecal discharges, producing a\r\ncondition which is more likely to soil the coat of the animal unless\r\ncare is taken. The same is true with animals kept on pasture in\r\ncomparison with those fed dry fodder.\r\n\r\nStall-fed animals, however, are more likely to have their flanks\r\nfouled, unless special attention is paid to the removal of the\r\nmanure. All dairy stalls should be provided with a manure drop which\r\nshould be cleaned as frequently as circumstances will permit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Bacteria on Hairs.\r\n\r\nEach colony on the hair represents one or more bacteria that were\r\nadherent to the hair when it was placed on the surface of the solid\r\nculture-medium.]\r\n\r\nThe animal contributes materially to the quota of germ life finding\r\nits way into the milk through the dislodgment of dust and filth\r\nparticles adhering to its hairy coat. The nature of this coat is\r\nsuch as to favor the retention of these particles. Unless care is\r\ntaken, the flanks and udder become polluted with fecal matter, which\r\nupon drying is displaced with every movement of the animal. Every\r\nhair or dirt particle so dislodged and finding its way into the\r\nmilk-pail adds its quota of organisms to the liquid. This can be\r\nreadily demonstrated by placing cow's hairs on the moist surface\r\nof gelatin culture plates. Almost invariably bacteria will be found\r\nin considerable numbers adhering to such hairs, as is indicated in\r\nFig. 9.\r\n\r\nDirt particles are even richer in germ life. Not only is there the\r\ndislodgment of hairs, epithelial scales, and masses of dirt and\r\nfilth, but during the milking process, as at all other times, every\r\nmotion of the animal is accompanied by a shower of _invisible_\r\nparticles, more or less teeming with bacterial life. All of this\r\nmaterial contains organisms that are more or less undesirable in\r\nmilk. Bacteria concerned in gassy fermentations and those capable of\r\nproducing obnoxious taints are particularly common, so that this\r\ntype of pollution is especially undesirable in milk.\r\n\r\n=Amount of dirt in milk.= When one remembers that the larger part of\r\nfresh manure is of such a nature that it does not appear as\r\nsediment, the presence of evident filth in milk must bespeak\r\ncareless methods of handling.\r\n\r\nThe sediment or dirt test is used quite extensively to ascertain the\r\namount of dirt milk may contain. By means of a cotton filter, the\r\ninsoluble residue is removed and is made evident upon a layer of\r\nabsorbent cotton. Milk that would show with difficulty any evidence\r\nof dirt upon ordinary examination reveals such defects very readily\r\nin this test.\r\n\r\n=Exclusion of dirt.= It is better to keep bacteria out of milk, so far\r\nas practicable, rather than to attempt to remove them after they\r\nhave once gained entrance. As is usual, prevention of trouble is\r\nmuch more easily accomplished than removing the difficulty after it\r\nonce occurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Dirt from Milk.\r\n\r\nThe dirt adherent to each of the filters was obtained from one pint\r\nof milk. The milks tested were produced on different farms.]\r\n\r\nMuch reduction as to the amount of dirt that finds its way into milk\r\nmay be accomplished by improved stable environment. The fouling of\r\nthe udder and flanks comes from wading in dirty water, muddy yards,\r\nand from improper type of stalls. Barnyards are often a disgrace\r\nthrough the accumulation of manure and seepage. Cows wading in such\r\nmire cannot but accumulate mud and filth to a material degree on the\r\nteats and udder. Greater care as to drainage of the barnyard and the\r\npaving of same with gravel, cinders, etc., will permit of its being\r\nkept clean, and so prevent the fouling of animals. But more\r\nimportant than the yard is the stall which the animal occupies in\r\nthe stable. The essential feature is to have a stall of such\r\nconstruction as to keep the animal out of her own manure when she\r\nlies down. To accomplish this, it is necessary to have a manure drop\r\nbehind the stall proper so that the feces and urine are kept out of\r\nthe bed of the stall as much as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--The Model Stall.\r\n\r\nA stall of this type keeps the animals clean, and thus aids greatly\r\nin producing good milk.]\r\n\r\nMost of the stalls widely advertised in the farm press seek to\r\naccomplish this in one way or another, usually by some arrangement\r\nby which the cow is forced back when standing and drawn forward on\r\nlying down. In Fig. 11 a type of stall is illustrated that\r\naccomplishes this most successfully; the essential feature being a\r\n2×3-inch wood strip nailed to the stall floor immediately in front\r\nof the hind feet of the animal when in a standing position. When the\r\nanimal lies down, she crowds forward to avoid lying on this strip,\r\nand thus is out of contact with the manure, except such as is\r\ncarried onto the bedding by the hind feet. By the use of this stall\r\nit is possible to keep the animals free from all accumulations of\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nEffort should be made to prevent fouling of the animals rather than\r\nin cleaning them after once soiled. It is very evident that where\r\nthe cattle come to the milker with muddy udders, they will not be so\r\ncleaned before milking as to prevent a large amount of such dirt\r\nfrom entering the milk. However, when all that can be done towards\r\nkeeping the cows clean has been accomplished, a small amount of\r\ngrooming will greatly reduce the contamination coming from them.\r\n\r\nThe kind of bedding used in the stalls may have a marked influence\r\non the contamination coming from the animal. If the straw is dusty,\r\npartially rotten and moldy, the bacteria and molds adhere to the\r\ncoat of the animal and are thus introduced into the milk. In the\r\ncase of cattle on pasture, no visible evidences of dirt are usually\r\npresent but the hair is covered with the dust coming from the soil.\r\nThere is very good reason to believe that the quality of milk is\r\ninfluenced by the type of pasture on which the cows graze, due to\r\nthe difference in the types of bacteria in the surface soil. The\r\nmilk from animals on low land is more likely to show undesirable\r\nfermentations than that from those grazing on higher lands. This is\r\nnot due to the influence of the feed as is often supposed but rather\r\nto the dirt from the coat of the animal.\r\n\r\n=Washing the udder.= If a surface is moist, dust and the adherent\r\nbacteria cannot be easily dislodged. The air over snow-covered\r\nmountains or over oceans is relatively free from bacteria. The udder\r\nand flanks of the animals can be carded to remove the loose hairs\r\nand the evident dirt; the fine dust can now be removed by wiping\r\nwith a clean damp cloth just before the milking process. The actual\r\nwashing and wiping of the udder and flanks still further reduces the\r\ncontamination coming from the animal; experiments show a reduction\r\nof fully three-fourths of total contamination. Clipping the udder\r\nand flanks also aids in keeping the animal clean.\r\n\r\nIt is often asserted that the treatment of the animals in these ways\r\nreduces the yield of milk. It is certain that such an effect will\r\npersist for only a short time and there is reason to believe that\r\ngrooming increases the yield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Sanitary Milk Pails.\r\n\r\nThe small opening is very efficient in keeping the dirt out of\r\nmilk.]\r\n\r\n=Sanitary milk pails.= The entrance of organisms into the milk can be\r\ngreatly reduced by lessening the area of the milk pail exposed to\r\nthe dust shower. To accomplish this purpose a number of so-called\r\nsanitary or hygienic milk pails have been devised. In some cases,\r\nthese are the regular type of pail provided with a cover having a\r\nsmall opening through which the milk is received. In other cases, a\r\nstrainer is interposed so as to remove more effectually the coarse\r\nparticles. While pails of this type are successful in the removal of\r\na large part of the dirt, and consequently reduce materially the\r\nbacterial content of the milk, yet they must be of simple\r\nconstruction, so that they can be kept in a clean condition in order\r\nto adapt them for general practical use. The use of such a utensil\r\nincreases materially the keeping quality of the milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Sanitary Milk Pails.\r\n\r\nThe Stadtmueller pail and the Truman pail, two of the most practical\r\nof the small-topped pails.]\r\n\r\nStocking has shown that under ordinary barn conditions, the use of\r\nsmall-topped pails reduced the number of bacteria 95 per cent; with\r\ndirty cows the reduction in bacteria amounted to 97 per cent. A\r\nsix-inch opening presents only one-fourth as large an exposure as a\r\ntwelve inch, so that the reduction in bacterial content is greater\r\nthan the lessening in the size of the openings of the pails. The\r\nordinary pail receives dust not only from the udder, but also from\r\nthe flank which is usually a more important source of contamination\r\nthan the udder itself, while the small-topped pail receives only\r\nthat from the udder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--use of Sanitary Milk Pails.\r\n\r\nThe open pail is fully exposed to the falling dust while the hooded\r\npail excludes much of the dust and dirt coming from the animal.]\r\n\r\n=Milking machines.= Where the milk is removed from the udder by\r\nmachine methods, instead of by hand, it is possible to eliminate\r\nnearly all external contamination from the animal and her\r\nsurroundings. The only opportunity for infection is then through the\r\nleakage of air around the teat cups. Care should be taken to see\r\nthat the teats are in a clean condition before applying the suction\r\ncups. The main problem in the use of a milking machine is to keep\r\nthe apparatus in an aseptic condition. Immersion of the teat cups\r\nand the rubber connections in lime water, brine solution, or other\r\nmild antiseptics, prevents bacterial development. Hastings has found\r\nthat milk having a germ content of less than 10,000 bacteria per\r\ncubic centimeter may be produced by the use of a properly handled\r\nmilking machine.\r\n\r\n=Contamination from the milker.= While the milker is a small factor in\r\ncomparison with the animal in the matter of contamination, yet he\r\ncan not be neglected, as it is within his power to affect profoundly\r\nthe quality of the milk. His personal habits as to cleanliness and\r\nhis appreciation of the precautions necessary in the production of\r\nclean milk have much to do with the contamination of the milk. The\r\nmilking should be done with dry hands, although a little vaseline\r\nmay be used with effect. The hands should be washed before milking\r\nas milk is certain to come in contact with them to some extent. The\r\nmilking should be done with the whole hand rather than stripping\r\nbetween the thumb and finger; the clothing should be covered with\r\nclean overalls and jumper, or at least a clean apron should be worn\r\nduring the milking. If these are of white material, more frequent\r\nlaundering is likely to result.\r\n\r\n=Contamination from air.= It is difficult to disassociate the\r\ncontamination arising from the condition of the air from that\r\nderived directly from the animal. Barn operations of various kinds\r\nresult in the production of dust, particularly where dry forage,\r\nsuch as hay or straw, is handled. Where manure is given an\r\nopportunity to dry, dust is readily produced, and such material is\r\nparticularly replete with bacterial life. Some kinds of dust, such\r\nas that originating from ground grains, or shavings that may be used\r\nfor bedding, contain a small amount of bacterial life in comparison\r\nwith the dust from hay, or other dry fodder. In a dried condition,\r\nthe slightest movement is apt to dislodge these fine particles, and\r\nthey float in the air for considerable periods of time. If milk is\r\ndrawn and exposed to the air of the barn during the feeding\r\noperations, it is subject to the dust shower that is present. Where\r\nthe storage can is allowed to stand in the stable during the\r\nmilking, even though it is covered with a strainer, this\r\naccumulation of microscopic particles is added to the milk, as they\r\nreadily pass the meshes of the finest strainer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--contamination From the Air.\r\n\r\nThis culture plate, three inches in diameter, was exposed for 30\r\nseconds in the barn during feeding of dry fodder. A 12-inch pail\r\nexposes over 18 times the surface of this plate.]\r\n\r\n=Removal of dirt after introduction.= The more primitive method of\r\nimproving the quality of milk, so far as its dirt content is\r\nconcerned, is to attempt to remove the grosser particles of\r\ncontamination after entrance. In the case of straining, the method\r\nis usually applied at the time of milking, but in the case of\r\nfiltering and clarifying, it is carried out at the milk station, in\r\nan effort to improve the appearance of milk and overcome the\r\ninfluence of careless methods of the producer. By the use of\r\nstrainers, either metallic or cloth, it is possible to remove\r\nparticles of hair, undissolved dirt and manure, but it must be\r\nremembered that these grosser _visible_ particles of pollution are\r\nnot really the cause of the troubles which may ensue in improperly\r\nhandled milk. The bacteria which are adherent to these foreign\r\nparticles are in large measure washed off in the process of\r\nstraining, and pass through the meshes of the finest strainer. The\r\nmain service, therefore, of straining is to improve the appearance\r\nof the milk, and it has no effect on the quality in any way.\r\n\r\n=Production of clean milk.= The problem of clean milk is important,\r\nwhatever may be the use to which milk may be put. It is important in\r\nthe manufacture of butter, but owing to the fact that the fat is not\r\nreadily acted upon by bacteria, it is not so sensitive to bacterial\r\nconditions, as when the milk is made into cheese. In this product,\r\nthe bacterial condition of the milk is a matter of prime importance.\r\nIn milk destined for direct consumption, the exclusion of the\r\nbacteria becomes yet more important. While it is impossible to\r\nexclude bacteria so completely that milk will not undergo\r\nfermentative changes, yet for domestic consumption it is preferable\r\nto have milk with as low bacterial content as can readily be\r\nsecured. The highest type of market milk, that known as sanitary, or\r\ncertified, is produced under such extreme conditions of care as to\r\ncontain the minimum germ content. To accomplish these results\r\nrequires such stringent control as to increase greatly the cost of\r\nthe product. Pure, clean milk can be produced at a very slight\r\nincrease in cost over the regular expense of milk production, if the\r\nright kind of attention is given to certain details of a practical\r\ncharacter. Improvement in our milk supplies must largely come from\r\nthis source, for any improvement to be permanent must be made to\r\npay, and it requires considerable education to secure the\r\nco-operation of consumers and their willingness to pay for any\r\nmaterial increase in the quality of the product.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing factors concerned in the contamination of milk, it\r\nis of course impossible to measure accurately the influence of the\r\ndifferent sources of infection, as these are continually subject to\r\nvariation in every case. As a rule, the most important factors are\r\nthose pertaining to the utensils and the condition of the animal\r\nherself. If these two factors are brought under reasonable control,\r\nthe major portion of contamination that ordinarily obtains is done\r\naway with. The application of the remedial or preventive measures\r\nheretofore mentioned will greatly reduce the germ content of the\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n=Cooling of milk on farm.= Bacterial growth is directly related to\r\ntemperature conditions, and with summer temperatures, such\r\ndevelopment goes on apace, unless it is checked by early cooling.\r\nThe larger portion of bacteria that find their way into milk,\r\nespecially those that are previously in contact with the air, are in\r\na dormant condition, and are therefore not stimulated into immediate\r\ngrowth, unless reasonably high temperatures prevail. In milk, which\r\ncomes from the animal at blood heat, this growth is greatly\r\nstimulated. To counteract this effect, milk should be chilled as\r\nsoon after milking as possible. If the temperature is immediately\r\nlowered to 50° F., or lower, actual cell development is greatly\r\nretarded, and the rate of souring, and other fermentative changes\r\nthereby diminished. In this country ice is liberally used in\r\naccomplishing this result. In Europe, the use of ice is much less\r\ncommon. The employment of such artificial means of refrigeration\r\nmakes possible the shipment of milk for long distances by rail. New\r\nYork city now receives milk that is produced in Canada and\r\nnortheastern Ohio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Effect of Cooling Milk.]\r\n\r\n=Aeration of milk=. The custom has been extensively recommended of\r\nsubjecting milk to the influence of air in the belief that such\r\nexposure permits of the interchange of gases that would improve the\r\nquality. In practice, this process, known as aeration, is carried on\r\nin different ways. In some cases, air is forced into the milk; in\r\nothers, the milk is allowed to distribute itself in a thin sheet\r\nover a broad surface, falling in drops or tiny streams through the\r\nair. Whenever this process is carried on at a temperature lower\r\nthan that of the milk, it results in more or less rapid cooling.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times, aeration was generally recommended and practiced,\r\nespecially in connection with the cheese industry, but carefully\r\ncontrolled experiments fail to show that the process exerts any\r\nmaterial influence on the rate of germ development. If it is carried\r\nout in an atmosphere more or less charged with bacteria, as in the\r\nbarn or stable, it is more than likely to add to the bacterial\r\ncontent of the milk. While to some extent odors may be eliminated by\r\nthe process, the custom is not followed so generally now as it used\r\nto be some years ago.\r\n\r\n=Absorption of taints.= A tainted condition in milk may result from\r\nthe development of bacteria, acting upon various constituents of the\r\nmilk, and transforming these in such a way, as to produce\r\nby-products that impair the flavor or appearance of the liquid; or\r\nit may be produced by the milk being brought in contact with any\r\nodoriferous or aromatic substance, under conditions that permit of\r\nthe direct absorption of such odors.\r\n\r\nThis latter class of taints is entirely independent of bacterial\r\naction, and is largely attributable to the physical property which\r\nmilk possesses of absorbing volatile odors. This direct absorption\r\nmay occur before the milk is withdrawn from the animal, or\r\nafterwards if exposed to strong odors.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for the milk of animals advanced in lactation to\r\nhave a more or less strongly marked odor and taste; sometimes it is\r\napt to be bitter, at other times salty to the taste. It is a defect\r\nthat is peculiar to individual animals, and is liable to recur at\r\napproximately the same period in lactation. The peculiar \"cowy\" or\r\n\"animal odor\" of fresh milk is an inherent peculiarity that is due\r\nto the direct absorption of volatile elements from the animal\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of feed consumed by the animal produce a more or less\r\npronounced taint or flavor in the milk. With some plants, such as\r\ngarlic, leeks, turnips, and cabbage, the odor is so pronounced as to\r\nrender the milk quite unfit for use. In some states along the\r\nAtlantic seaboard, wild plants of this character in woodland\r\npastures may be so abundant as to make it impossible to pasture\r\nmilch animals. The difficulty in such cases is due to absorption of\r\nthe volatile principles into the circulation of the animal, and if\r\nsuch feed is consumed shortly before milking, the characteristic\r\nodors appear in the milk. If consumed immediately after the milk is\r\nwithdrawn from the animal, sufficient time may elapse so that the\r\npeculiar odors are dissipated before the milk is again secreted. The\r\nsame principle applies in a lesser degree to the use of certain\r\ngreen fodders that are more suitable for feed, such as rape, green\r\nrye, or even silage. Silage produces a distinct, but not unpleasant\r\nodor in milk, but newly pastured rye often confers so strong an odor\r\nas to render the milk unusable.\r\n\r\nWhere certain drugs are employed in the treatment of animals, such\r\nas belladonna, castor oil, sulfur, or turpentine, the peculiar odors\r\nmay reappear in the milk. Such mineral poisons as arsenic have been\r\nknown to persist for a period of three weeks before elimination.\r\n\r\nOn account of the elimination of many drugs, unchanged, from the\r\nanimal in the milk, the milk of any animal that is receiving\r\nmedicine should not be used for human food. When such milk is mixed\r\nwith that of a number of other animals and when it is used by\r\nadults, no harm is likely to result, but when the dilution is not\r\ngreat and the milk is used for young children it may affect them\r\nthrough its content of the drug. The feed may not only affect the\r\nquality of milk but its value as food. One of the most prominent of\r\nAmerican dairymen, who has for many years produced milk especially\r\nfor children's use, has said that he could feed his cows so as to\r\nmake ill every child receiving the milk.\r\n\r\n=Absorption of odors after milking.= If milk is brought in contact\r\nwith strong odors after being drawn from the animal, it will absorb\r\nthem readily, as in the barn, where frequently it is exposed to the\r\nodor of manure and other fermenting organic matter.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a popular belief that milk evolves odors and cannot\r\nabsorb them so long as it is warmer than the surrounding air, but\r\nfrom experiments of one of us (R), it has been definitely shown that\r\nthe direct absorption of odors takes place much more rapidly when\r\nthe milk is warm than when cold, although under either condition, it\r\nabsorbs volatile substances quite rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe custom of straining the milk in the barn has long been\r\ndeprecated as inconsistent with proper dairy practice, and in the\r\nlight of the above experiments, an additional reason is evident why\r\nthis should not be done.\r\n\r\nEven after milk is thoroughly cooled, it may absorb odors, as is\r\nnoted where the same is stored in a refrigerator with certain\r\nfruits, meats, fish, etc.\r\n\r\n=Distinguishing bacterial from other taints.= In perfectly fresh milk\r\nit is relatively easy to distinguish between taints caused by the\r\ngrowth of bacteria and those attributable to direct absorption. If\r\nthe taint is evident at time of milking, it is in all probability\r\ndue to character of feed consumed, or possibly to medicines. If,\r\nhowever, the intensity of the taint grows more pronounced as the\r\nmilk becomes older, then it is probably due to living organisms\r\nwhich require a certain period of incubation before their\r\nby-products are most evident.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the difficulty is of bacterial origin, it can be\r\nfrequently produced in another lot of milk (heated or sterilized is\r\npreferable) by inoculating the same with some of the original milk.\r\nNot all abnormal fermentations are able, though, to compete with the\r\nlactic acid bacteria, and hence outbreaks of this sort soon die out\r\nby the re-establishment of more normal conditions.\r\n\r\n=Factory contamination.= As the time element is of importance in the\r\nproduction of troubles due to bacteria, it follows that infection of\r\nmilk on the farm is fraught with more consequence than factory\r\ncontamination, as the organisms introduced would have a longer\r\nperiod of development. Nevertheless, the conditions in the factory\r\nare by no means to be ignored, as they not infrequently permit the\r\nmilk to become seeded with highly undesirable types. A much more\r\nrigid control can be exercised in the factory, where steam is at\r\nhand as an aid in the destruction of organisms. In the cleaning of\r\npumps and pipes, steam is absolutely necessary to keep such\r\napparatus in a sanitary condition.\r\n\r\nThe water supply of the factory is a matter of prime importance, as\r\nwater is used so extensively in all factory operations. When taken\r\nfrom a shallow well, especially if surface drainage from the\r\nfactory is possible, the water may be contaminated to such an extent\r\nas to introduce undesirable bacteria in such numbers that the normal\r\ncourse of fermentation may be changed. The quality of the water,\r\naside from flavor, can best be determined by making a curd test (p.\r\n99) which is done by adding some of the water to boiled milk, and\r\nincubating the same. If \"gassy\" fermentations occur, it signifies an\r\nabnormal condition. In deep wells, pumped as thoroughly as is\r\ngenerally the case with factory wells, the germ content should be\r\nvery low, ranging from a few score to a few hundred bacteria per\r\ncubic centimeter at most. The danger from ice is much less, for the\r\nreason that good daily practice does not sanction using ice directly\r\nin contact with milk or cream. Then, too, water is largely purified\r\nin the process of freezing, although if secured from a polluted\r\nsource, reliance should not be placed in this method of\r\npurification, for even freezing does not destroy all vegetating\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary house fly is an important source of contamination in\r\ncreameries, cheese factories and city milk plants. They are of\r\nimportance not only in increasing the number of fermentative\r\nbacteria in milk but they may serve to contaminate it with\r\ndisease-producing organisms. The windows of all places where milk is\r\nhandled, whether on the farm or elsewhere should be screened.\r\n\r\nIt should be kept in mind in the handling of milk and other dairy\r\nproducts that human food is being prepared and that cleanliness is\r\ndesirable from every point of view, and that the methods of\r\nhandling and production should compare with those used in the\r\npreparation of foods which like milk cannot be cleaned when once\r\npolluted. Desirability, keeping quality, healthfulness and the value\r\nof every product made from milk depends upon the extent and amount\r\nof contamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nINFECTION OF MILK WITH PATHOGENIC BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the disease-producing, or pathogenic bacteria, are able to\r\ninfect milk supplies is shown by the fact that numerous epidemics of\r\ncontagious disease have been directly traced to milk infection. Milk\r\nis generally consumed in a raw state, and as a considerable number\r\nof this class of organisms are able not only to live but actually\r\ngrow in milk, which is such an ideal culture-medium for the\r\ndevelopment of most bacteria, it is not surprising that disease\r\nprocesses should be traced to this source. The organisms in milk\r\ncapable of causing disease do not alter or change its physical\r\nproperties sufficiently to enable their presence to be detected by a\r\nphysical examination.\r\n\r\n=Origin of pathogenic bacteria in milk.= Disease-producing bacteria\r\nmay be grouped, with reference to their relation toward milk, into\r\ntwo classes, depending upon the manner in which infection occurs:\r\n\r\nClass I. Disease-producing bacteria capable of being transmitted\r\ndirectly from a diseased animal to man through the medium of\r\ninfected milk.\r\n\r\nClass II. Bacteria pathogenic for man but not for cattle, which are\r\ncapable of thriving in milk after it is drawn from the animal.\r\n\r\nIn the first group, the disease produced by the specific organism\r\nmust be common to both cattle and man. The organism must live a\r\nparasitic life in the animal, developing in the udder, and so infect\r\nthe udder. It may, of course, happen that diseases toward which\r\ndomestic animals alone are susceptible may be spread from one animal\r\nto another in this way without affecting human beings.\r\n\r\nIn the second group the bacterial species live a saprophytic\r\nexistence, growing in milk, as in any other nutrient medium, if it\r\nhappens to find its way therein. In such cases, milk indirectly\r\nserves as an agent in the dissemination of disease, by giving\r\nconditions favorable to the growth of the disease germ.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important of diseases that may be transmitted\r\ndirectly from animal to man through a milk supply is tuberculosis,\r\nbut in addition to this, foot and mouth disease (aphthous fever in\r\nchildren), Malta fever, and acute enteric troubles have also been\r\ntraced to a similar source of infection.\r\n\r\nThe most important specific diseases that are disseminated through\r\nsubsequent infection of the milk are typhoid fever, diphtheria,\r\nscarlet fever, and cholera, but, of course, the possibility exists\r\nthat any disease germ capable of living and thriving in milk may be\r\nspread in this way. In addition to these diseases that are caused by\r\nthe introduction of specific organisms (the causal organism of\r\nscarlet fever has not yet been definitely determined), there are a\r\nlarge number of more or less illy defined troubles of an intestinal\r\ncharacter that occur especially in infants and young children that\r\nare undoubtedly attributable to the activity of micro-organisms that\r\ngain access to milk during and subsequent to the milking, and which\r\nproduce changes in milk before or after its ingestion that result\r\nin the formation of toxic products.\r\n\r\n=Tuberculosis.= This disease is by far the most important bacterial\r\nmalady that affects man and beast. In man, it assumes a wide variety\r\nof phases, ranging from consumption, tuberculosis of the lungs,\r\nwhich is by far the most common type, to scrofulous glands in the\r\nneck, cold abscesses, hip-joint, and bone diseases, as well as\r\naffection of the bowels. These various manifestations are all\r\nproduced by the inroads of the specific organism, Bacillus\r\ntuberculosis. The bovine, as well as swine, fowls, and other\r\nwarm-blooded animals, are also affected with similar diseases. In\r\nman, the importance of the malady is recognized when it appears that\r\nfully one-seventh of the human race die of this scourge. In cattle,\r\nthe disease is equally widespread, particularly in those countries\r\nwhere live stock has been intensively developed. In the northern\r\ncountries of Europe, such as Denmark, Germany, England, France, and\r\nthe Netherlands, as well as in Canada, and this country, this\r\ndisease has been most widely disseminated. This has been occasioned,\r\nin large measure, because of the exceedingly insidious nature of the\r\ndisease in cattle, thereby permitting interchange of such diseased\r\nstock without the disease being recognized. Tuberculosis is found\r\nmore abundantly in this country in dairy than in beef stock. Dairy\r\ncattle are, however, not more susceptible, but the closer\r\nenvironment in which milch cattle are kept, and the fact that there\r\nhas been greater activity in the matter of introducing improved\r\nstrains, accounts for the larger percentage of affected animals.\r\n\r\nIt has been a disputed question for some years whether the organisms\r\nproducing bovine and human tuberculosis are identical or from the\r\npractical standpoint, whether the bovine type of disease is\r\ntransmitted under natural conditions to man. The bacteriologist can\r\nreadily detect differences in appearance, in growth of cultures, and\r\nin disease-producing properties between the two strains. Of the two,\r\nthe bovine is much the more virulent when inoculated into\r\nexperimental animals. In a considerable number of cases, record of\r\naccidental infection from cattle to man has been observed. These\r\nhave occurred in persons making postmortem examination on\r\ntuberculous animals, and the tubercular nature of the wound proven\r\nby excision and inoculation.\r\n\r\nMore recently, since the agitation by Robert Koch of Germany, a\r\nnumber of scientific commissions have studied particularly the\r\nproblem of transmission. It is now estimated that perhaps seven per\r\ncent of the tuberculosis in man is of bovine origin. This is almost\r\nwholly confined to children. The portions of the body that become\r\ndiseased, when the infection has resulted from the use of milk, are\r\nthe glands of the neck and of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n=Manner of infection in man.= In the main, the source of the malady\r\nmay be traced either to air infection or to the food, if one\r\ndisregards the comparatively small number of cases of wound\r\ninfection. Air is frequently a medium by which the germ is\r\ntransferred from one person to another. The sputum is exceedingly\r\nrich in tubercle bacilli and since this material is carelessly\r\ndistributed by tubercular people, the air of the cities, villages\r\nand public buildings will frequently contain tubercle organisms.\r\nSome of the organisms in the air find their way into the lungs,\r\nthere to develop and produce consumption. The organisms in the air\r\nmay be deposited in the nasal passages and throat, and ultimately\r\nfind their way into the tissues of the body by penetrating the walls\r\nof the throat or of the intestine. It is probable that the tubercle\r\nbacilli thus introduced may find their way to the lungs and there\r\ndevelop without leaving any trace of their path.\r\n\r\nFood may also possibly serve as a medium of infection. The\r\ncontamination of solid food from flies and other sources is, of\r\ncourse, a possibility, but tuberculous meat from cattle and swine is\r\nmuch more likely to occur, although it must be said that the\r\nprocesses of preparing such food for use (roasting, frying, and\r\nboiling) are sufficient to destroy the vitality of the causal\r\norganism. The fact that most food products of this character are now\r\ninspected renders this possibility less likely to occur.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, the likelihood of ingesting tubercle organisms is\r\nmuch greater with milk than with any other food supply, as milk is\r\nconsumed usually in an uncooked state, and as microscopic and\r\nphysiologic tests indicate that not infrequently milk from\r\ntuberculous animals contains these organisms.\r\n\r\n=Distribution of the disease in animals.= As practically any organ of\r\nthe body may be affected with tuberculosis, it naturally follows\r\nthat the lesions of this disease are widely distributed. The disease\r\ngerm is introduced, in the main, through the lymph and not the blood\r\nsystem; consequently, in the initial stages the evidence of\r\ntuberculosis is often comparatively slight, and the lesion is\r\nrestricted in its development. Where such a condition obtains, it is\r\nknown as \"closed,\" in contradistinction to \"open\" tuberculosis,\r\nwhere the diseased tissue is more or less broken down and is\r\ndischarging into the circulation, or elsewhere. Manifestly, the\r\ndanger of spreading not only in the affected animal itself, but to\r\nthe outside, is much greater in the case of the open lesion.\r\nEspecially is this true where the disease is present in the lungs or\r\norgans that have an exterior opening so that the material containing\r\nthe organisms is discharged from the body in the sputum, manure,\r\nurine or milk. The intestines themselves are rarely affected, but\r\nthe lymph glands associated with the intestinal tract are not\r\ninfrequently involved.\r\n\r\n=Infection of milk with tubercle bacilli.= In a small percentage of\r\ncases, the udder itself becomes involved. Where this condition\r\nobtains, one or more hard lumps are formed, which slowly increase in\r\nsize, usually being restricted to one quarter of the udder.\r\nSometimes the affected quarter may develop to an enormous size,\r\nproducing a hard, painless tumor. Not often does the affected tissue\r\nbreak down into pus; consequently, no abnormal appearance is to be\r\nnoted in the milk secretion until the disease has made very extended\r\nprogress, in which case the percentage of fat generally diminishes.\r\nWhenever the udder shows physical manifestation of this disease, the\r\nmilk almost invariably is rich in tubercle bacilli.\r\n\r\nTubercle organisms may also appear in milk of animals in which no\r\nphysical symptoms of the disease are to be found. This fact has been\r\ndemonstrated by microscopic and animal experiments, but it is also\r\nabundantly confirmed by the frequent contraction of the disease by\r\ncalves and hogs when fed on factory by-products. This latter class\r\nof animals is particularly dangerous, because there is no way in\r\nwhich the danger can be recognized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--a Tuberculous Animal.\r\n\r\nThe animal appears perfectly healthy although she has had the\r\ndisease for five years.]\r\n\r\nIt has also been proven that milk may become infected through the\r\nfeces. In coughing up material from the lungs and associated glands,\r\nthe matter is swallowed, instead of expectorated, as in man. The\r\norganisms retain their vitality in the intestine, and are voided in\r\nthe feces. Under ordinary conditions, the flanks and udder become\r\nmore or less polluted with such filth, and the evidence is\r\nconclusive that infection of milk is not infrequently occasioned in\r\nthis way. The fact that hogs following tuberculous steers in the\r\nfeeding lots are very likely to acquire the disease is explained by\r\nthe presence of tubercle organisms in the manure of such animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--a Tuberculous Animal.\r\n\r\nThe last stages of generalized tuberculosis. Note the emaciated\r\ncondition.]\r\n\r\nIt must be kept in mind that many animals may be infected with\r\ntubercle bacilli and therefore have tuberculosis in the incipient\r\nstages, without their being able to disseminate the disease to\r\nothers. In the early stages, they are bacillus-carriers without\r\nbeing necessarily dangerous at that particular time, but the\r\npossibility always exists, as the disease develops in the system,\r\nthat the trouble may assume a more formidable character, and that\r\nslowly developing chronic lesions may become acute, and \"open,\" in\r\nwhich case, the affected animal becomes a positive menace to the\r\nherd. As the time when the lesions change from the \"closed\" to the\r\n\"open\" type and the animal becomes a source of danger cannot be\r\ndetermined, the only safe way to do is to exclude the milk of all\r\ntuberculous animals from the general supply, whether for direct\r\nconsumption, or for manufacture into dairy products and to look upon\r\nevery diseased animal as a menace to the herd. This is rendered all\r\nthe more necessary when the milk is used for the feeding of\r\nchildren, who are relatively more susceptible to intestinal\r\ninfection than the adult. The early stages of the disease in cattle\r\nare, however, so insidious that no reliance can be placed upon the\r\ndetection of the malady by physical means. Fortunately, in the\r\ntuberculin test, a method is at hand, which in a simple, but\r\neffective manner, enables the disease to be distinguished in even\r\nthe early stages, long before recognition is possible in any other\r\nway.\r\n\r\n=Tubercle bacilli in dairy products.= When infected milk is used for\r\nthe preparation of butter and cheese, the organisms inevitably are\r\nincorporated in them. In the separation of milk a relatively large\r\npart of the tubercle organisms in the milk appear in the cream. In\r\nthe making of cheese even more of the organisms are held in the\r\ncurd. In butter and cheese, as in milk, no growth of the organism\r\ncan take place; however, the vitality of the organism is retained\r\nfor a considerable number of months. It is not believed that these\r\nproducts are of much importance in the spread of tuberculosis in the\r\nhuman family, since they are not consumed by children to any extent.\r\nCream is to be considered as a means of distribution since it is\r\noften used by children.\r\n\r\n=Treatment of tuberculous milk.= It is easily possible to treat milk\r\nor factory by-products so as to render them positively safe. The\r\nprocess of pasteurization or sterilization is applicable to whole\r\nmilk, and when effectively done destroys entirely the vitality of\r\nany tubercle bacilli. In making such exposure, care should be taken\r\nto prevent the formation of the \"scalded layer,\" as the resistance\r\nof the organism toward heat is greatly increased under these\r\nconditions. In a closed receptacle, 140° F. for 15 to 20 minutes has\r\nbeen found thoroughly effective in destroying this organism. A\r\nmomentary exposure at 176° F. is likewise sufficient. This is the\r\nmethod that is almost universally used in Denmark in the manufacture\r\nof the finest butter.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of factory by-products, heat should also be\r\nemployed. In Denmark, compulsory pasteurization at not less than\r\n176° F. is required. This treatment prevents not only the\r\ndissemination of tuberculosis among hogs and young cattle, but is\r\nequally efficacious in preventing the spread of foot and mouth\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe per cent of tuberculous milch cows varies widely in different\r\nsections of the country, being greatest in the older dairy sections,\r\nand in those supplying milk to the cities, on account of the\r\nconstant buying and selling of animals, thus giving more frequent\r\nopportunity of introducing the disease into the herds. Throughout\r\nthe country at large, probably less than ten per cent of the cows\r\nare tuberculous, and it is estimated that at least one per cent of\r\nthe diseased animals have tuberculous udders. It has been suggested\r\nthat the dilution of the milk of such animals with that of healthy\r\ncows would remove a great part of the danger from milk. In the\r\ncase where the milk of a large number of herds is mixed, this may be\r\nof some importance, but in no case is it safe to assume that\r\ndilution of the milk of tuberculous cows is any guarantee of safety.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that milk, perfectly normal in appearance, coming\r\nfrom a tuberculous udder could be diluted a million times and still\r\nproduce the disease on inoculation into experimental animals. In the\r\ncase of swine, the susceptibility is so great that a single feeding\r\nof infected milk, even in a very dilute condition, causes with\r\ncertainty the production of the disease.\r\n\r\nSome observers maintain that the contamination of the milk with the\r\nmanure of tuberculous animals is of greater hygienic importance,\r\nthan that coming from diseased udders, since the number of animals\r\nhaving tuberculosis of the lungs and intestines is far greater than\r\nthose with diseased udders.\r\n\r\n=Economic aspects of bovine tuberculosis.= Not only is this disease\r\ninvested with much importance because of its inter-relation with the\r\nhuman, but from an economic point of view alone, it is undoubtedly\r\nthe greatest scourge that affects the dairyman. Its insidiousness\r\nmakes it exceedingly difficult to recognize. The consequence is that\r\nmany fine herds become seriously involved before its presence is\r\nrecognized. In the main, the disease is introduced into a herd by\r\npurchase, often by buying in pure-bred stock to improve the quality\r\nof the herd. Where the disease has been established in a region for\r\nsome time, there is also danger that unheated factory by-products,\r\nas skim milk and whey, may function in its spread. Where such\r\nconditions prevail, the spread of the disease in the creamery\r\ndistrict is exceedingly rapid. When once introduced into a herd,\r\nthe disease sooner or later spreads from the originally affected\r\nanimal to others in the herd. Close contact, and close confinement\r\nin ill ventilated stables facilitate the spread of the disease, and\r\nsooner or later, other animals acquire the trouble. This may all\r\noccur while all animals appear in a healthy condition.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the disease in the earlier stages are quite\r\nindefinite. As the disease progresses, the nutritive functions\r\nappear to be disturbed, and sooner or later, the body weight begins\r\nto decline, and finally marked emaciation ensues. Accompanying this\r\ncondition, especially when the disease is in the lungs, is a cough,\r\nwhich is generally aggravated with active exercise. While the\r\nrun-down condition permits frequently of the detection of the\r\ndisease in the advanced stages, it is wholly impossible with any\r\naccuracy to diagnose the trouble in the incipient stages. It is at\r\nthis stage that the tuberculin test comes to the aid of the\r\nstockman.\r\n\r\n_Tuberculin test._ This test is made by the injecting beneath the\r\nskin of the animal a small quantity (about 2 c. c.) of tuberculin,\r\nand noting the temperature of the animal, before and after the\r\ninjection. Tuberculin, a product of the growth of the tubercle\r\nbacillus, when injected into the body causes a marked rise in\r\ntemperature, in the case of an animal affected with the disease, and\r\nno such elevation in the case of a healthy animal. The process of\r\npreparing tuberculin makes it absolutely free from danger, so far as\r\nliability of producing the disease, or in any way injuring the\r\nanimal, is concerned. Fig. 19 shows the temperature range of both\r\nreacting and non-reacting animals. While the test is not\r\nabsolutely infallible, it is so far superior to any and all other\r\nmethods of diagnosis that it should take precedence over them.\r\n\r\n=Miscellaneous diseases.= There are a number of diseases that affect\r\nboth human beings and cattle, the causal organisms of which may be\r\ntransmitted through the milk. Foot and mouth disease is one wide\r\nspread in European countries but which has not yet gained a\r\npermanent foothold in this country. The ingestion of the milk, which\r\nalways contains the causal organism, produces the disease in both\r\nhumans and cattle. In the human the disease is very similar to that\r\nin cattle; it may end in death. Vesicles are produced in the mouth,\r\non the lips, nose and fingers. The causal organism, which has not\r\nyet been demonstrated, may occur in butter or cheese. It is easily\r\ndestroyed by pasteurizing the milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Temperature Curves.\r\n\r\n1, the temperature curve of a healthy animal after injection with\r\ntuberculin; 2 and 3, the temperature curves of tuberculous animals\r\nafter injection with tuberculin. (After Moore.)]\r\n\r\nAnthrax, actinomycosis (lumpy jaw), rabies, and malta fever are\r\ndiseases the organisms of which have been found in the milk of\r\naffected animals. In case of the first three, while the possibility\r\nexists of the infection of human beings by milk, it is improbable\r\nthat such infection does normally occur. Malta fever is becoming an\r\nimportant disease in portions of southern Europe. It is produced in\r\nman by the use of milk of goats suffering from the disease.\r\n\r\nThe organism causing contagious abortion in cattle is known to be\r\npresent in the milk of the infected animal at the time of its\r\nwithdrawal from the udder. It is not probable that the organism is\r\nof any sanitary significance as far as man is concerned. It has been\r\nshown that the organism is able to produce a disease in guinea pigs\r\non artificial inoculation that is very similar, so far as the\r\nlesions are concerned, to tuberculosis. It is also probable that the\r\nby-products of creameries and cheese factories may serve to spread\r\nthe disease from one herd to another.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the udder (garget) is a frequent trouble in every\r\nherd. It is marked by the swelling of one or more quarters, by the\r\nappearance of fever and changes in the appearance and composition of\r\nthe milk. The inflammation may be caused by cold or injury, or by\r\nthe invasion of the udder with pus-forming bacteria. In the first\r\ncase the trouble is not likely to persist for any length of time,\r\nand does not spread to other members of the herd. The milk may be\r\nmore or less stringy, and may show a slimy flocculent sediment. It\r\ncannot be asserted that such milk is harmful to man but it should be\r\nrejected on general sanitary grounds, and because it cannot always\r\nbe differentiated from that coming from an udder in which the\r\ninflammation is produced by bacteria.\r\n\r\nInflammation caused by the invasion of the udder with specific\r\nbacteria is usually of greater severity, the entire gland often\r\nbecoming involved. The secretion of milk may cease and the function\r\nof the diseased quarters may never be restored. The milk in the less\r\nsevere cases may not be abnormal in appearance, but with increasing\r\nseverity, the nature of the milk changes, until it may be a watery\r\nliquid. The milk of any animal suffering from any form of garget\r\nshould be rejected, as it may cause trouble, especially in children.\r\nThere is some reason to believe that organisms coming from cases of\r\ngarget have been responsible for the extensive outbreaks of septic\r\nsore throat that have occurred in some parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe milk of animals suffering from indigestion, diarrhea, abscesses\r\non any part of the body, as from those which have retained the\r\nafterbirth should be likewise rejected. In short only the milk of\r\nhealthy animals should be used for human food; that from any animal\r\nsuffering from any disease or which is receiving medical treatment\r\nshould not be so used.\r\n\r\n=Typhoid fever=. The most important disease germ, distributed through\r\nthe medium of milk, that is unable to produce a diseased condition\r\nin the cow is the organism of typhoid fever. This malady is an\r\nintestinal affliction of man, and the germ causing the same is found\r\nabundantly in the dejecta, both solid and liquid, as well as in the\r\nblood in certain stages of the disease. While the causal organism\r\ndoes not leave the body through the expired air, it is found\r\nabundantly in both the urine and feces. Therefore, the dejecta, and\r\nany articles that may be soiled with the same become a positive\r\nmenace.\r\n\r\nMany different methods of transmitting the contagion exist, such as\r\nwater, food infected in various ways, contact with infected persons,\r\nand through the medium of milk. Milk is not so frequently the cause\r\nof dissemination as the other factors, but where milk supplies\r\nbecome contaminated, epidemics of considerable magnitude are wont to\r\noccur. The danger from milk is also aggravated by the fact that the\r\ntyphoid bacillus is capable of withstanding considerable amounts of\r\nacid, and consequently finds, even in raw milk containing the normal\r\nlactic acid bacteria, conditions favorable for its growth. In a\r\nconsiderable percentage of cases, the disease is not sufficiently\r\nsevere to cause the patient to take to his bed. These so-called\r\n\"walking typhoid\" cases are particularly dangerous, because they\r\nserve to spread the disease organism more widely.\r\n\r\nA very considerable proportion of the people that recover from\r\ntyphoid fever still continue to harbor the typhoid bacillus in their\r\nurinary and gall bladders. This condition may obtain for years, and\r\nsince such individuals are in perfect health and are ignorant of\r\ntheir own condition, and since they give off the organisms more or\r\nless constantly, they are often the cause of extensive milk borne\r\nepidemics. Such persons are known as \"typhoid carriers\" and\r\nconstitute one of the gravest problems the public official has to\r\ncontend with in his struggle to prevent the spread of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nWhere outbreaks are caused by milk, they can readily be traced by\r\nmeans of the milk route, as there are always a sufficient number of\r\nsusceptible persons, so that outbreaks of epidemic proportions\r\ndevelop. In the Stamford, Conn., outbreak in 1895, 386 cases\r\ndeveloped on one milk route. In this case it was shown that the\r\ncarrying cans were thoroughly washed, but were later rinsed out with\r\n_cold_ water from a polluted shallow well.\r\n\r\nThe mode of infection of milk varies, but in general, the original\r\npollution is occasioned by the use of infected water in washing the\r\nutensils, or a case of \"walking typhoid\" or bacillus carrier, who\r\ndirectly infects the milk. In case of sickness in rural families,\r\nsome member of the household may serve in the dual capacity of nurse\r\nand milkmaid, thus establishing the necessary connection. Busey and\r\nKober report twenty-one outbreaks, in which dairy employees also\r\nacted in the capacity of nurses. The fact that the urine of a\r\nconvalescent may retain the typhoid germ in large numbers for some\r\nweeks renders the danger from this source in reality greater than\r\nfrom feces, as, naturally, much less care is exercised in the\r\ndisposition of the urine.\r\n\r\nThe house fly is now regarded as one of the important means of\r\nspreading typhoid fever, indeed it is often called the \"typhoid\r\nfly.\" The infectious material deposited in an open vault may serve\r\nas a source from which the fly carries the organisms to milk and\r\nother foods in the house or elsewhere. The protection of vaults and\r\nthe screening of every place where human food is handled or prepared\r\nis the only protection.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that in the case of the tubercle organism,\r\nno growth ever occurs in milk, but with the typhoid bacillus growth\r\nis possible. It thus needs but the contamination of the milk with\r\nthe smallest particle of material containing them to seed the\r\nmilk. By the time it is consumed it may contain myriads of the\r\ndisease-producing organisms.\r\n\r\n=Diphtheria.= This is a highly infectious disease, affecting children\r\nprimarily and is characterized by the formation of membranous\r\nexudates in the throat and air passages, which are teeming with the\r\ncausal organism, the diphtheria bacillus. This organism is capable\r\nof forming highly toxic products, and it is to the effect of these\r\npoisons that its fatal result is generally due. The organism is\r\nthrown out from the body, in the main, through the mouth, the\r\nsurroundings of the patient being infected directly from the air,\r\nand indirectly, by contact with polluted hands, lips, etc. Thus, the\r\ngerm deposited from the lips of a case of the disease, on the common\r\ndrinking cup, slate, lead pencils, toys, and the like, may easily\r\npass from child to child. Not infrequently, the causal organism\r\npersists in the throat long after all evidence of membranous growth\r\nhas subsided, and so the child itself may act as a \"bacillus\r\ncarrier.\"\r\n\r\nNot so many epidemics of diphtheria as of typhoid have been traced\r\nto milk, but the evidence is sufficient to indict milk as a\r\ndisseminator of contagion. In several cases, the diphtheria germ has\r\nactually been isolated from infected milk supplies. Actual growth of\r\nthe diphtheria germ is said to take place in raw milk more rapidly\r\nthan in sterilized.\r\n\r\n=Scarlet fever.= While the germ of scarlet fever has not yet been\r\nisolated, and therefore its life history in relation to milk cannot\r\nbe depicted so accurately, yet milk-borne epidemics of this disease\r\nare sufficiently abundant to leave no doubt but that this food\r\nmedium may sometimes serve as a means of disseminating such\r\ntroubles. Infection of the milk doubtless comes in the case of this\r\ndisease from direct contact with a person suffering from the malady.\r\n\r\n=Cholera.= While this disease is of no practical importance in\r\nAmerica, owing to its relative infrequency, yet outbreaks of cholera\r\nhave been traced to milk, in spite of the fact that the causal\r\norganism is more sensitive to the action of acids than most\r\ndisease-producing bacteria. In several outbreaks in India, milk has\r\nbeen the medium through which the disease was spread. Generally,\r\ninfection of the milk has been traced to the use of polluted water.\r\n\r\n=Children's diseases.= An exceedingly high mortality exists among\r\ninfants and young children in the more congested centers, especially\r\nduring the summer months. In the main, the cause of these troubles\r\nis due to intestinal disturbances, and unquestionably, the character\r\nof the food enters largely into the problem. As milk constitutes\r\nsuch a large proportion of the diet of the young, and is so\r\nsusceptible to bacterial invasion, it would appear probable that\r\nmuch of the trouble of this character is due to the condition of\r\nthis food supply. This is rendered more probable when it is\r\nremembered that bottle-fed infants suffer a much higher mortality\r\nthan breast-fed children, due probably to the fact that the\r\nlengthened period between the time the milk is drawn and consumed\r\npermits of abundant bacterial growth. Much carelessness also\r\nprevails among the poor in cities, relative to the care of utensils\r\nused in feeding children. Nursing bottles often serve to infect the\r\nmilk. Where milk is pasteurized, or properly heated, it has been\r\nfound that the mortality rate has been greatly reduced, thus\r\nindicating that the condition of the milk was directly responsible\r\nfor the death rate. In fact, the mortality from these indefinite\r\nintestinal troubles probably exceeds that from all of the specific\r\ninfectious diseases combined. Improved care in handling this\r\nsensitive food supply will do much to better conditions in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n=Ptomaine poisoning.= Acute poisoning affecting adults as well as\r\nchildren, not infrequently occurs from the use of foods of various\r\nkinds. Cases of poisoning arising from the use of shell fish, canned\r\nmeats, ice cream, cheese, and other dairy products, are from time to\r\ntime reported. These troubles are due to the production of toxic\r\ncompounds, in the main, probably caused by bacterial decompositions.\r\nOften such troubles may affect a number of persons, as at banquets\r\nand such gatherings, thereby giving the semblance of an epidemic.\r\nWhile such troubles are doubtless to be ascribed to bacterial\r\nactivity, they are not transmissible from person to person.\r\n\r\nIn the case of troubles arising from ice cream and such confections,\r\nthe probable cause is due to the storage of milk or cream under\r\nrefrigerator conditions, where germ growth can go on in the product,\r\nand yet the temperature be sufficiently low to prevent the usual\r\nacid fermentations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFERMENTATIONS OF MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk, under normal conditions, is always contaminated with bacteria\r\ncoming from the most varied sources. If it is produced under clean\r\nconditions, the number of bacteria will be small, but in any case,\r\nthe number of kinds of bacteria that find their way into milk will\r\nbe large. Many of them find in milk at ordinary temperatures\r\nsuitable conditions for growth; they use a portion of some of the\r\nconstituents of the milk as food, producing certain other compounds\r\nthat are known as \"by-products.\" These by-products impart to milk a\r\ntaste and odor that is not found in fresh milk. The effect of the\r\naction of bacteria may also be made evident by the change in the\r\nappearance of the milk. When these various changes become evident to\r\nthe senses, either by taste, smell or sight, the milk usually is so\r\nmodified as to be unfit for many ordinary purposes. The preservation\r\nof milk, a subject to be treated later, is a study of the ways of\r\npreventing or retarding the growth of bacteria in milk, and thus\r\ndelaying the time when evidences of their action first become\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nEach class of bacteria produces more or less specific changes\r\nin the milk as a result of their growth. Certain bacteria are\r\nof the greatest benefit to the butter and cheese maker, while\r\nothers are distinctly harmful to the manufacturer of dairy\r\nproducts. The changes produced by the different bacteria are called\r\n\"fermentations\" of milk, each being most commonly named from the\r\nmost important by-product formed.\r\n\r\n=Acid fermentation of milk.= Fresh milk has a sweet taste and little\r\nor no odor, but if it is allowed to stand at ordinary temperatures,\r\nit sours; the taste is no longer sweet because the sweetness of the\r\nsugar of the milk is masked by the acid produced from the\r\ndecomposition of a portion of the sugar by the bacteria. The change\r\nin odor and taste of milk is apparent long before the appearance is\r\naltered and increases in intensity as the acid-fermentation\r\nprogresses. The first alteration in appearance is most usually one\r\nof consistency; the liquid milk is transformed into a semi-solid\r\nmass. The terms \"curdling\" and \"sour\" are usually synonymous. Milk\r\nis, however, often said to be sour as soon as the acid fermentation\r\nhas progressed to a point where it is evident to taste or smell.\r\nThis process of souring, or the acid fermentation is so common a\r\nchange that raw milk which does not show this type of fermentation\r\nis looked upon with suspicion, and, usually, justly so. The process\r\nin the past was thought to be something inherent in the milk, a\r\nnatural and inevitable change. It is now known that this is not so,\r\nbut that it is due to certain kinds of bacteria, and that if these\r\nare prevented from getting into milk, it will not sour, but will\r\nundergo some other less desirable type of decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe acid-forming bacteria comprise but a very small part of the\r\ntotal number of organisms that find their way into the milk during\r\nits production on the farm, yet in sour milk scarcely any other\r\nkinds of bacteria can be found. At ordinary air temperatures, the\r\nacid-forming bacteria grow more rapidly in milk than do any other\r\nforms, and the acid produced by them renders the milk an unfavorable\r\nmedium for the growth of other bacteria. This is the reason why milk\r\npractically always undergoes the acid fermentation, although it is\r\ncontaminated with a host of other kinds of bacteria. If a mixture of\r\nseeds is sown on low wet ground, certain kinds will grow best; if\r\nthe same mixture is sown on drier land, other types will find most\r\nfavorable conditions for growth, and the plants which appeared on\r\nthe low land will not appear. The same condition is found in milk\r\nwhere the environment is most favorable for the acid-forming\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\n=Amount of acid formed in milk.= In this country the acidity of milk\r\nis expressed as so many per cent of lactic acid. A milk that shows\r\nan acidity of one per cent should, theoretically, contain one pound\r\nof lactic acid in each one hundred pounds of milk. The acid\r\ndetermined does not actually represent lactic acid, as there are\r\nother substances in milk which act as acids, with the reagents used\r\nin the present methods of determining the acidity of milk. For\r\ninstance, perfectly fresh milk has an apparent acidity of 0.13 to\r\n0.18 per cent, although no fermentation has occurred. Other acids\r\nthan lactic are formed in the acid fermentation, but the entire acid\r\ncontent is referred to as lactic when speaking of the acidity of\r\nmilk. When the developing acidity of milk reaches 0.25 to 0.3 per\r\ncent, a sour taste becomes evident and the milk will curdle on\r\nheating. When the acidity increases to 0.6 to 0.7 per cent, the milk\r\ncurdles at ordinary temperatures. The acidity continues, however, to\r\nincrease until it reaches about 1 per cent, which is the maximum\r\namount that will be produced in milk by the ordinary acid-forming\r\nbacteria. Milk contains about 4 per cent of milk sugar, all of which\r\nis fermentable. If this were all decomposed by bacteria, the acidity\r\nof the milk would actually exceed 4 per cent. It is thus evident\r\nthat the reason why more acid is not formed in milk is not because\r\nof any lack of sugar. The bacteria, like all other kinds of living\r\nthings, are injured by their own by-products, unless these are\r\nconstantly removed in some way; in milk the bacteria cannot escape\r\nthe action of the acid which they themselves have formed,\r\nconsequently growth ceases. The amount of acid formed is dependent\r\non the kind of bacteria present and on the composition of the milk.\r\nCertain bacteria will not produce enough acid to cause the curdling\r\nof the milk; still others will form 2 or even 3 per cent. These\r\ntypes, however, do not play any important part in the spontaneous\r\nsouring of milk.\r\n\r\nIn milk the acid first formed combines with the ash constituents and\r\nthe casein to form salts which do not seriously affect the growth of\r\nthe bacteria. Ultimately, the limit of the ash and casein to take up\r\nacid is reached, and free lactic acid which is harmful to bacterial\r\ngrowth appears. If the content of casein and ash constituents is\r\nhigh, a higher degree of acidity will be reached than in a milk with\r\na lower content. If a large part of the volume of the milk is made\r\nup of a compound that has no role whatever in the acid fermentation,\r\nsuch as the butter fat in cream, the amount of acid formed per unit\r\nvolume of milk will be reduced, since in determining the acidity, a\r\ndefinite volume of milk is taken, and the acidity is expressed, as\r\nsuch a per cent of this amount.\r\n\r\n=Types of acid-forming bacteria.= When substances undergo\r\ndecomposition, it is a common belief that compounds offensive to the\r\nodor and taste are formed; but such is not necessarily the case. The\r\nproducts of the decomposition may be as agreeable and as harmless as\r\nthe compounds decomposed. Whether the decomposition products of any\r\nsubstance are offensive or not is dependent on the kinds of\r\nmicro-organisms acting on it. There are forms of acid-producing\r\nbacteria that change milk in odor, taste, and appearance, yet the\r\nsour milk is not offensive in any sense of the word. Other bacteria\r\nalso sour the milk, but produce offensive odors and a disagreeable\r\ntaste. Thus, the acid-forming bacteria may be divided into two main\r\ngroups, which may be designated as desirable and undesirable. This\r\ndivision is of importance to the butter and cheese maker and to the\r\nconsumer of milk.\r\n\r\n=Desirable acid-forming bacteria.= If milk is produced under clean\r\nconditions, it is not likely to have a disagreeable odor or taste at\r\nany time, even when it is sour; rather the taste is agreeable like\r\nthat of good butter milk. The curd is perfectly homogeneous, showing\r\nno holes or rents, due to the development of gas, and there is but\r\nlittle tendency for the whey to be expressed from the curd. This\r\ntype of fermentation is largely produced by the group of bacteria to\r\nwhich has been given the name, _Bacillus lactis acidi_.\r\n\r\nThe main by-product of this group of bacteria is lactic acid; small\r\namounts of acetic acid and alcohol, with traces of other compounds,\r\nare also formed. The agreeable odor and to some extent the flavor of\r\nmilk fermented by these bacteria is due to other by-products than\r\nlactic acid, for this has no odor and only a sour taste. The acid\r\nfermentation of milk is often called the lactic acid fermentation.\r\nIn reality only the fermentation produced by the desirable group in\r\nwhich lactic acid is the most evident by-product should be thus\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Different Types of Curds.\r\n\r\nOn the left a solid, homogeneous curd produced by desirable\r\nbacteria; on the right, the curd produced by harmful bacteria. Note\r\nthe gas holes and free whey.]\r\n\r\nThe bacteria of this group may enter the milk from the dust coming\r\nfrom the coat of the cow. They are also found in the barn dust and\r\non cultivated plants. Under ordinary farm conditions, the larger\r\npart of those found in milk come directly from the utensils. If the\r\nmilk is drawn under extremely clean conditions and care is taken to\r\nsterilize the utensils, but few acid-forming bacteria of any kind\r\nwill enter the milk; under such conditions most of the acid-forming\r\nbacteria will belong to the group in question. They find, however,\r\nsuch favorable conditions for growth in milk that they develop more\r\nrapidly than most other types with which milk becomes seeded;\r\nconsequently under normal conditions, they gain the ascendency and\r\nso control the type of fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe desirable type of acid-forming bacteria do not form spores;\r\nhence, are easily killed by heating the milk. They can grow in the\r\npresence or in the absence of free oxygen. In the bottom of a can of\r\nmilk or in the middle of a cheese, there is no air, yet these\r\nbacteria grow as well under these conditions, as in milk exposed to\r\nthe air. The range of temperature for growth varies from 50° to 100°\r\nF. but development is most rapid at 90° to 95° F. and about 1 per\r\ncent of acid is formed.\r\n\r\nAnother group of bacteria which may be classed among the desirable\r\nacid-forming organisms is constantly found in milk. They have little\r\nto do with the ordinary acid fermentation as they grow very slowly\r\nat ordinary temperatures. If a sample of raw milk is placed at the\r\ntemperature of the animal body, the acidity will reach 1 per cent in\r\na few hours. Thereafter the acidity will increase slowly and may\r\nreach three per cent or above. The continued increase in acid is due\r\nto the growth of long rods of the _Bacillus Bulgaricus_ type,\r\nwhich apparently enter the milk with the fecal matter. The nature of\r\nthe change produced by them in milk is very similar to that caused\r\nby _Bact. lactis acidi_ in that lactic acid is the chief product; no\r\ngas is produced and hence the curd is uniform in appearance.\r\nTemperatures from 100° to 110° F. favor their development. Organisms\r\nbelonging to this group are used in the preparation of the fermented\r\nmilks now so widely sold in the cities.\r\n\r\nThese desirable, acid-forming bacteria are of the greatest service\r\nin every branch of the dairy industry, whether in butter or in\r\ncheese making, or in the sale of milk in the city. The dairy\r\nindustry is dependent upon fermentative activity, as much as the\r\nmanufacture of beer or wine, and the main basis of this is the acid\r\nfermentation of the milk by these desirable types of bacteria.\r\n\r\nAlthough milk contains a large amount of nitrogenous substances\r\n(casein and albumen), it does not undergo putrid decomposition, as\r\ndo meat and eggs, not because it is not fitted for the growth of the\r\nbacteria causing that type of change, but because the acid formed in\r\nit stops the growth of the putrefactive bacteria. If a sample of\r\nmilk is placed in a stoppered bottle, it will have much the same\r\ntaste and odor at the end of several months as at the end of a few\r\ndays. The acid acts as a preservative, like the vinegar in pickles,\r\nor the acid in silage and in sauerkraut. Meat placed in a stoppered\r\nbottle which is then filled with milk will be preserved.\r\n\r\nThe products formed in the decomposition of meat and eggs are not\r\nonly offensive but may also be injurious to the health of the\r\nconsumer. Milk that has been fermented by the desirable kinds of\r\nacid-forming bacteria is not harmful. It is consumed in a variety of\r\nforms (buttermilk, cottage cheese) as a common article of food and\r\nits use is rapidly increasing. The preparation of the pure culture\r\nbuttermilks or artificially soured milks that are now so frequently\r\nrecommended for digestive troubles rests upon an acid fermentation\r\nof this type.\r\n\r\n=Undesirable acid-forming bacteria.= Other types of bacteria capable\r\nof forming substances that impart to milk an offensive odor and a\r\ndisagreeable taste not infrequently appear instead of the desirable\r\ngroup. Instead of producing from the sugar of milk large quantities\r\nof lactic acid, these types generate other acids, such as acetic and\r\nformic, which impart a sharp taste to the milk. Besides the acids\r\nthe bacteria of this group form gases from the sugar of the milk.\r\nSome produce small amounts of gas; others so much that the curd will\r\nbe spongy and will float on the surface of the whey. The\r\nfermentation caused by them is often called a \"gassy fermentation\"\r\nand is dreaded by butter and cheese makers since the gas is\r\nindicative of bad flavors that will appear in the product. Gas may\r\nalso be produced in other types of fermentations to be discussed\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThis class of bacteria enters the milk with the dust, dirt, and\r\nmanure, in which materials they are especially abundant. No spores\r\nare formed; hence they are easily killed by heating the milk. They\r\ngrow both in the presence and in the absence of free oxygen. High\r\ntemperatures favor their growth, most rapid development taking\r\nplace at 100° to 103° F.\r\n\r\n=Spontaneous fermentation of milk.= The normal souring of milk is due\r\nto a mixture of these two groups of bacteria. The relative\r\nproportions existing between the two in any sample of milk is\r\ndependent on a number of factors, most important of which is the\r\ndegree of cleanliness exercised in the production of the milk. Where\r\ncareless conditions obtain under which dust and manure particles\r\nfind their way into milk, it becomes more abundantly seeded with\r\ngas-generating bacteria, and consequently, the type of fermentation\r\nis undesirable. If, however, the milk is drawn into clean utensils\r\nand care is taken to exclude dirt, the pure lactic acid types are\r\nable to control the character of the changes produced, and a clean,\r\npleasant tasting liquid results. It will be seen that things are\r\nwell arranged by nature; one of the most important food products\r\nundergoes a type of decomposition that is not offensive and when\r\nproduced under clean conditions, the sour milk is as healthful a\r\nfood as is the fresh product. Thus there is every reason for\r\ncleanliness in the production of milk, for cleanliness' sake and\r\nbecause clean milk means better products, and greater returns to\r\neveryone, producer and dealer.\r\n\r\nThere are other kinds of acid-forming bacteria in milk but they are\r\nof small importance compared with those just discussed. Some of the\r\nbacteria derived from the inside of the udder of the cow form acid,\r\nbut these forms grow very slowly in milk at ordinary temperatures,\r\nand have no influence on the keeping quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Different Types of Curds.\r\n\r\nThe flask on the left shows the soft curd produced by the bacteria\r\nthat curdle the milk without the production of acid. The flask on\r\nthe right shows the gassy curd formed by butyric acid bacteria in\r\nheated milk.]\r\n\r\n=Sweet curdling fermentation of milk.= Samples of milk are sometimes\r\nfound that are curdled, but which do not taste sour, or have the\r\nnormal odor of sour milk. The curd is usually soft and the taste\r\nbitter. It is evident that the curdling cannot be due to the same\r\nfactors as in the normal souring of milk. Such a change is similar\r\nto the action of rennet which is used to curdle the milk in cheese\r\nmaking. This ferment will curdle perfectly sweet milk, producing a\r\ncurd that looks like that formed in the acid fermentation of milk.\r\nThe cause of these sweet curdling milks, which appear from time to\r\ntime, is due to the introduction of certain bacteria which have the\r\npower of secreting an enzyme resembling that found in rennet. In\r\nsuch cases the milks curdle prematurely especially when warmed. The\r\ncurd may gradually disappear, for the bacteria also produce another\r\nenzyme that digests the curd, and thus renders it soluble. When this\r\nadvanced phase becomes evident, it is often called the _digestive\r\nfermentation_ of milk. This change is produced largely by\r\nputrefactive bacteria of various kinds that find their way into milk\r\nwith dust and dirt. Many of them are spore formers; hence, are not\r\nkilled when milk is heated, as in pasteurization, while the\r\nacid-formers are destroyed. Pasteurized milk is thus likely to\r\nundergo the sweet-curdling fermentation, if it is kept for\r\nany length of time. Raw milk rarely undergoes this type of\r\ndecomposition, since the rennet-forming bacteria under ordinary\r\nconditions are unable to develop in competition with the\r\nacid-forming bacteria.\r\n\r\n=Butyric acid fermentation of milk.= A fermentation that is much less\r\nfrequently noted than the two previously discussed is known as the\r\nbutyric fermentation, since butyric acid is the principal\r\nby-product. The causal bacteria cannot compete with the ordinary\r\nacid-forming bacteria in raw milk; hence it is most frequently noted\r\nin pasteurized milk, since the organisms produce spores and are not\r\nkilled by the heating. Pasteurized milk under the action of the\r\nbutyric acid bacteria undergoes a gassy fermentation, developing a\r\npronounced acidity and the disagreeable odor of butyric acid, which\r\nresembles that of rancid butter. The butyric acid bacteria are\r\nanaerobic, and thus can grow in butter and cheese away from the air.\r\n\r\n=Slimy or ropy fermentation of milk.= A slimy or ropy condition of\r\nmilk is frequently noted on the farm and in the dairy. Several\r\ncauses for this abnormal condition exist. Sometimes the milk may be\r\nslimy when milked from the cow. This occurs most frequently in the\r\ncase of inflammation of the udder which may or may not be due to\r\nbacteria. The direct cause of the abnormal condition in milk is the\r\npresence of fibrin and white corpuscles from the blood which form\r\nmasses of slimy material; in such cases the trouble does not\r\nincrease in intensity with age, nor can it be propogated by\r\ntransference to another sample of fresh milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Slimy Milk.\r\n\r\nIt does not mix with water when poured into it.]\r\n\r\nAnother type of slimy milk is produced by the growth of certain\r\ntypes of bacteria which enter the milk after it is drawn from the\r\nudder. These may come from various sources. The bacteria concerned\r\nbelong to two groups: (1) those that grow best in the air and do not\r\nform acid; (2) those that grow in the absence of air, throughout the\r\nentire mass of milk and which form acid. The slimy condition is\r\nnoted in the milk only after the milk has been stored for some time;\r\nit usually increases with the age of the milk and can be produced\r\nin a second sample by transferring a little of the slimy milk to it.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation produced by the aerobic bacteria is most often met\r\nin bottled milk and cream during the warmer times of the year. On\r\naccount of their relation to oxygen, the growth is confined to the\r\nsurface of the milk and only the upper layer becomes slimy; thus\r\nwhen the cream is removed, the abnormal condition is noted. The\r\nsliminess is due to the mass of bacterial growth rather than to the\r\nproduction of any specific substance in the milk. This trouble may\r\nbe of considerable economic importance to the dealer, as such\r\nabnormal milk is objectionable for ordinary use, but as far as is\r\nknown, it is incapable of affecting the health of the consumer.\r\n\r\nIn numerous outbreaks of this trouble the source of contamination\r\nhas been traced to infection from well water or a stream, as the\r\norganisms causing the trouble are found naturally in water. Keeping\r\nthe milk in a tank in the pump house sometimes permits of troubles\r\nof this sort, the water used for cooling giving opportunity for\r\ncontamination. Cattle wading in a stream sometimes pollute their\r\nudders and so indirectly infect the milk. Such outbreaks rarely\r\npersist for any considerable length of time as the common acid\r\norganisms soon regain the ascendency.\r\n\r\nCreameries and cheese factories are sometimes troubled with\r\nsliminess in starters. This seems to be due to some change which the\r\nordinary lactic acid bacteria undergo on long propagation rather\r\nthan to contamination of the starter. There are, however, types of\r\nacid-producing bacteria that are able to form specific substances in\r\nmilk that are slimy in character. Two of these forms of slimy milk\r\nare of economic importance. The slimy whey (lange Wei) of Holland\r\nis added to milk in the manufacture of Edam cheese, apparently\r\nserving the same purpose as the addition of the pure culture starter\r\nin cheddar cheese making. In Norway, a sour, slimy milk\r\n(taettemjolk) is used as food. It is produced by the addition of\r\nsome previously fermented milk. This beverage is also used in some\r\nof the Norwegian settlements of Wisconsin, the original seed having\r\nbeen brought from Norway, and the bacteria maintained by constant\r\npropagation from one sample of milk to another. The milk has the\r\nodor and taste of butter milk, but is not especially appetizing in\r\nappearance to any one not accustomed to it; it is, however, as\r\nharmless to health as is any other form of sour milk. It is not\r\nknown that any of these forms of slimy milk are distinctly harmful\r\nto the quality of butter or cheese.\r\n\r\n=Alcoholic fermentation of milk.= The bacteria as a class are\r\nincapable of producing alcohol in appreciable amounts. The alcoholic\r\nbeverages, beer, wine, and cider, are produced by the growth of\r\nyeast, in such sugar containing liquids as fruit juices, extracts of\r\ngrains, etc. The common types of yeasts are incapable of acting on\r\nmilk sugar, but they can ferment glucose, maltose, and cane sugar,\r\nforming equal amounts of alcohol and carbonic acid gas, which causes\r\nthe effervescence of fermented and carbonated drinks. There are,\r\nhowever, some types of yeasts found in milk and its products that\r\nare able to ferment milk sugar.\r\n\r\nAll yeasts grow best in an acid medium, hence those fermenting milk\r\nsugar find suitable conditions for growth in sour milk or whey. They\r\nmay at times become of economic importance in the cheese industry,\r\nbecause of the contamination of the milk with large numbers of\r\nthem. The arrangement of the whey vat is often such that it cannot\r\nbe completely emptied and cleaned; the sour whey thus presents\r\nfavorable conditions for the growth of the lactose-fermenting\r\nyeasts. The return of the whey to the farm in the milk can that is\r\noften imperfectly cleaned may serve to contaminate the milk with the\r\nyeast. In the making of Swiss cheese the whey is often so handled as\r\nto favor especially the growth of such yeasts, and since this type\r\nof cheese is prepared from sweet milk, the competition between the\r\nyeast and the acid-forming bacteria is not so sharp as in the making\r\nof cheddar cheese. The writers have found several instances where\r\nconsiderable loss was occasioned in the Swiss cheese industry\r\nthrough the development of gassy cheese due to this type of\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nThe yeasty or alcoholic fermentation may also be of importance in\r\nbutter making. In many sections of the country the milk is separated\r\non the farm and the cream is forwarded to the creamery at more or\r\nless infrequent intervals. It becomes sour and if it has become\r\ncontaminated with yeasts, they will find favorable conditions for\r\ngrowth in the acid medium. A large amount of carbon dioxide gas is\r\nproduced. Cans of gathered cream often foam to such an extent as to\r\nrun over, and in some cases actual explosions have occurred on\r\naccount of the great pressure caused by the gas.\r\n\r\n=Bitter fermentation of milk.= Bitterness in milk may be due to\r\nbacteria that enter the milk after it is drawn from the cow, or it\r\nmay be caused by the feed consumed by the animal. It has been\r\npreviously shown that certain specific substances contained in the\r\nfood may be absorbed and reappear in the milk. If the animal eats\r\nragweed, lupines, or other plants containing bitter substances, the\r\nmilk is likely to have a bitter taste, which will be noticeable at\r\nthe time the milk is drawn. The milk of cows at certain advanced\r\nstages of lactation may show a bitter taste, due to a change in the\r\nash constituents of the milk in which the lime salts are largely\r\nreplaced by salts of sodium.\r\n\r\nThere are many bacteria that will impart to milk a bitter taste.\r\nMilk that has undergone the sweet-curdling fermentation is likely to\r\nbe bitter, as is the ease with pasteurized milk. Some of the\r\nacid-forming bacteria are able to develop a bitter principle, the\r\nmilk retaining a pleasant odor and having the normal amount of acid,\r\nwhile the taste is intensely bitter. One of the authors (H) found in\r\nthe case of a Wisconsin brick cheese factory, that the usual acid\r\norganism was almost wholly replaced by a bitter type.\r\n\r\nStorage of milk at very low temperatures is conducive to the\r\nappearance of a bitter taste in milk, the explanation in this case\r\nbeing that the acid-forming bacteria are unable to grow at a low\r\ntemperature, while some of the putrefactive forms can multiply and\r\ndevelop these astringent or bitter by-products.\r\n\r\n=Miscellaneous fermentations of milk.= There are a number of other\r\nabnormal fermentations in milk that occur so rarely as to be of but\r\nlittle economic importance. Some, as the colored milks, are however,\r\nquite striking, and on this account have had much attention directed\r\nto them in the past. There are bacteria that are able to produce\r\nvarious colored substances, such as red, yellow, and blue. In case\r\nmilk becomes seeded with large numbers of any of these kinds, it is\r\nvery likely to be colored by the growth. Red milk may be due to\r\nbacteria, but more frequently is caused by the actual presence of\r\nblood in the milk, due to a wound in the udder, or the effect of a\r\nsevere case of inflammation of this gland. Such a condition may be\r\nreadily distinguished by allowing the milk to stand for a short\r\ntime, in which case, if due to blood, the red corpuscles will soon\r\nsettle to the bottom of the container, while bacterial troubles\r\nproducing a red coloration are more evident on the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is also claimed that certain bacteria may impart a soapy taste or\r\nturnip flavor to milk.\r\n\r\n=Cycle of fermentations in milk.= If a sample of milk is allowed to\r\nstand, it will undergo a certain sequence of fermentations that well\r\nillustrates the principle that one type of organisms is dependent on\r\nsome other type to furnish suitable conditions for its development.\r\nThis cycle of changes that normally occurs in milk is as follows:\r\n(1) The bacteria that come from the interior of the udder are the\r\nfirst to develop, but usually the change they produce is not\r\nevident.\r\n\r\n(2) Of the types that gain admission, subsequent to the milking, the\r\nacid-producing species are able to adjust themselves most perfectly\r\nto the conditions that obtain in milk. Within a few hours they\r\ngreatly predominate and soon the milk curdles under the production\r\nof acid. Their growth, however, is soon stopped by the accumulation\r\nof their own by-products.\r\n\r\n(3) The semi-solid curdled milk, on account of its acid reaction\r\nthen becomes a favorable medium for the growth of molds; a prevalent\r\nform, known as _Oidium lactis_ usually develops as a white velvety\r\nlayer. The molds in their growth form alkaline by-products, which\r\ntend to neutralize the acid reaction, so that in the course of two\r\nto three weeks, if the layer of the milk is not too deep (an inch or\r\nless), the chemical reaction of the milk becomes neutral or\r\nalkaline.\r\n\r\n(4) The putrefactive bacteria which found their way into milk when\r\nit was first drawn, and which have remained dormant in the sour\r\nmilk, now find favorable conditions for growth. As a result of their\r\nactivity, the milk soon undergoes a putrid decomposition, which is\r\nmarked by offensive odors.\r\n\r\nIf the milk is placed under such conditions as will exclude the\r\ngrowth of the mold, such as where the air is excluded from the\r\nsurface, the sour milk will remain in that condition for an\r\nindefinite period, since the putrefactive bacteria are inhibited in\r\ntheir development by the acid, in a manner comparable to the\r\npreservation of pickles in vinegar, or the keeping of silage because\r\nof the acid that is produced as a result of the changes that the\r\nplant tissue undergoes when excluded from the air. The preservative\r\neffect of acids is of much importance in the case of certain dairy\r\nproducts (see Chapter VIII).\r\n\r\n=Fermented drinks from milk.= Within the last few years a great deal\r\nof attention has been directed toward the preparation of various\r\nkinds of drinks from milk. The use of such beverages has rapidly\r\nincreased. Butter milk is one which meets with the greatest\r\napproval. The true butter milk from cream that has been soured by\r\nthe desirable acid-forming bacteria has a mild agreeable acid taste,\r\nwholly free from any sharpness that is often noted in butter milk\r\nmade from cream in which considerable numbers of the undesirable\r\nacid-forming bacteria have grown. Butter milk made from pasteurized\r\ncream soured with pure cultures will have good keeping qualities and\r\nis a most healthful drink for all classes of people, even for young\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nButter milk is also prepared by allowing milk to sour and then\r\nbreaking up the curd by stirring. If the type of fermentation is\r\ncontrolled as may be done (see Chapter VII), such a form of\r\nfermented milk is a most desirable drink. It is probably as\r\nhealthful and has all the therapeutic properties that are ascribed\r\nto other forms of fermented milks such as the Bulgarian \"Yoghurt.\"\r\n\r\nThis type of fermented milk is produced by an acid-forming organism\r\nthat can form large amounts of acid, 2.0 or 3.0 per cent. The casein\r\nis dissolved to some extent and the remainder so changed, that it\r\nwill remain in suspension for a long time in a finely divided form,\r\nafter the curd has been broken up. Such milk is sold under various\r\nnames at home and abroad. One of the authors (H) has found such\r\norganisms in practically all milks examined. If raw milk is kept\r\nwarm (98° to 100° F.) in a stoppered bottle which is filled full,\r\nthe acidity will be found to increase slowly from day to day,\r\nreaching a maximum in ten to fourteen days. If the milk is then\r\nexamined, it will be found to contain large numbers of an\r\nacid-forming organism very different in appearance from the bacteria\r\ncausing the rapid souring of milk at ordinary temperatures. This\r\norganism is very similar if not identical with the one found in the\r\nBulgarian milk to which the name _B. Bulgaricus_ has been given. The\r\nuse of the milk fermented by this organism has spread rapidly\r\nbecause it is claimed by certain European bacteriologists that it\r\nhas a favorable effect on the health of people, especially those\r\nsuffering from intestinal troubles. It is not at all certain\r\nthat ordinary sour milk or butter milk will not have the same\r\neffect; in fact in many of the fermented milks sold in Europe, _B.\r\nBulgaricus_ has not been found, but only the ordinary lactic acid\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nSeveral alcoholic drinks made from milk, such as kefir and koumiss,\r\nhave been originated among the nomadic tribes of Western Asia. Kefir\r\nis prepared from cow's milk by adding the kefir ferment in the form\r\nof grains which contain a number of kinds of bacteria and a yeast.\r\nThe acid-forming bacteria impart a sour taste to the fermented milk,\r\nwhile the yeast forms carbon dioxide and about two per cent of\r\nalcohol. If the milk is allowed to ferment in stoppered bottles, the\r\nresulting product will be an acid effervescing drink, which is\r\nclaimed to be more easily digested than sweet milk. This drink is\r\nused frequently in the treatment of invalids but it is improbable\r\nthat it is more easily digested than ordinary soured milk or butter\r\nmilk. The grains are removed from the fermented milk, and are then\r\nadded to a quantity of fresh milk, or they may be dried and kept for\r\nfuture use. When needed again, they are soaked in water, then added\r\nto the milk.\r\n\r\nKoumiss is made in Russia from mare's milk and has much the same\r\ncomposition as kefir. In America and Europe it is made from cow's\r\nmilk, by adding cane sugar and compressed yeast. The yeast ferments\r\nthe cane sugar while the acid-forming bacteria ferment the milk\r\nsugar. There is thus obtained a drink that is similar in composition\r\nto the real koumiss, in which both the acid and the alcohol come\r\nfrom the fermentation of the milk sugar. In koumiss and kefir the\r\ncurd is very finely divided and will remain in suspension for a long\r\ntime as with butter milk.\r\n\r\n=Determination of the cause of taints in milk.= It is often of the\r\ngreatest importance to be able to locate the cause of abnormal\r\nodors or tastes in milk, since methods for overcoming the trouble\r\ncan be intelligently applied only when the actual cause is known. An\r\nabnormal condition may be caused either by the direct absorption of\r\nodors before or after the milk is drawn from the animal, or it may\r\nbe due to bacteria. If the milk appears bad-flavored when first\r\ndrawn, and if such taint becomes less pronounced as the milk becomes\r\nolder, it is likely that the trouble is due to some characteristic\r\nof the feed. Certain feeds, like green rye, rape, cabbage, and\r\ncertain of the root crops, like turnips, impart a strong odor to\r\nmilk, if the same are fed shortly before milking. If the tainted\r\ncondition appears only some time after the milk is drawn, it may be\r\ndue to the direct absorption of taints from the surroundings in\r\nwhich the milk is kept, or it may be caused by bacteria. These\r\ncauses can often be differentiated, by noting whether the taint\r\ntends to increase in intensity with age. If such is the case, it is\r\nlikely that the cause is of germ origin, but if the reverse is true,\r\nit cannot be ascribed with certainty to bacteria and recourse must\r\nbe had to other methods, such as the transfer of a small quantity of\r\nthe tainted milk to a sample of perfectly fresh milk, or preferably\r\nto some milk that has been heated to the boiling point and then\r\ncooled. In the case of an odor due to direct physical absorption, it\r\nwill not appear in the inoculated sample, since the small amount\r\ntransferred is not sufficient to be noted. If it is due to living\r\norganisms, the inoculation of the smallest quantity into a fresh\r\nsample is likely to reproduce the same change as originally noted.\r\n\r\n=Tests for the bacteriological condition of milk.= Within certain\r\nlimits milk can be indirectly examined as to its bacterial content\r\nwithout any special equipment. Milk when drawn from the cow has an\r\napparent acidity ranging from 0.16 to 0.18 per cent. By the use of\r\nany of the methods of determining acidity in milk, much can be told\r\nconcerning the number of bacteria in the milk, and hence concerning\r\nits keeping quality. Milk that has an acidity of over 0.2 per cent\r\nis certain to contain many bacteria, and consequently will keep\r\npoorly. Such milk is of low value for market milk, but may not be\r\nobjectionable for butter or cheese making. If the acidity is below\r\n0.2 per cent, but little can be told as to the numbers of bacteria,\r\nsince any increase in acid is always preceded by an enormous\r\nincrease in the numbers of acid-forming bacteria.\r\n\r\nA more important test than the acid test, from the standpoint of the\r\nbutter and cheese maker, and even the milk dealer, is the\r\nfermentation test. In its simplest form, it consists in placing a\r\nsample of the milk to be tested in a warm place and noting the time\r\nrequired to curdle and the type of curd formed. In this country the\r\nfermentation test has been largely supplanted by the Wisconsin curd\r\ntest which possesses the advantage of detecting the presence of\r\nbacteria harmful in cheese making, especially the gas forming\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nThe curd test is helpful in detecting the source of an abnormal\r\ncondition in a milk supply coming from diverse sources. The milk\r\nfurnished by each patron can be tested separately and the trouble\r\nlocated, perhaps in an individual herd; the offending herd\r\ndetermined, the test may then be used on the milk of individual\r\ncows. The cheese maker and the milk dealer should be able not only\r\nto detect which of the patrons furnish him poor milk, but he should\r\nbe able to give the patron definite instructions how to avoid the\r\nsources of such trouble. This information can be given only when\r\nthe source is positively known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Curd Test.\r\n\r\nA good curd obtained from milk containing no harmful bacteria but\r\nmany desirable acid-forming organisms.]\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin curd test is made as follows: Samples of the milk to\r\nbe tested are placed in sterile pint fruit jars. The milk is warmed\r\nto 90° F., ten drops of rennet are added to each sample, and as soon\r\nas the curd is solid, it is cut into small pieces with a case knife\r\nso as to facilitate the expulsion of the whey. As the curd settles\r\nto the bottom of the vessel, the whey is poured off at intervals so\r\nthat a pat of firm curd is left. As the milk curdles the bacteria\r\nare enmeshed and are carried with the curd. The jars are kept at a\r\ntemperature of 100° to 105° F., since this temperature is favorable\r\nto growth of the bacteria that are sought, the gas-forming\r\norganisms. At the end of ten to twelve hours, the jars are examined;\r\nif the curd is solid, the texture firm, not mushy or slimy on the\r\nsurface, if the odor is agreeable, it indicates that the milk\r\ncontains few or none of the undesirable forms of bacteria. If the\r\ncurd is full of gas holes, it is apparent that undesirable bacteria\r\nare present and under such circumstances the curd will not have an\r\nagreeable odor. If the gas-forming bacteria are numerous, the curd\r\nmay even be spongy from the abundance of gas holes, and the\r\nundesirable odor more pronounced. Such curds are tough and rubbery.\r\nIn some cases a bad flavor or odor is apparent even though the\r\ntexture of the curd is not open and full of holes. The curd, the\r\nsurface of which is slimy indicates undesirable organisms. A solid\r\ncurd of agreeable odor is indicative of the presence of the\r\ndesirable acid-forming bacteria. Such a milk is excellent from the\r\nstandpoint of the butter or cheese maker, but may not be so\r\ndesirable from the standpoint of the milk dealer on account of its\r\npoor keeping qualities. On the other hand a milk suitable from the\r\nstandpoint of the milk dealer, on account of its low germ content,\r\nand hence good keeping quality, may give a poor curd test. It is\r\ncertain to contain some bacteria, especially those from the interior\r\nof the udder while it may contain none of the desirable acid-forming\r\norganisms without which a curd of good texture and flavor can not be\r\nobtained. The bacteria in the clean milk will grow rapidly at the\r\nhigh temperatures at which the curds are kept and the changes they\r\nwill produce as to flavor and odor may be undesirable. The milk\r\nmight be judged as poor when in reality it might be a most excellent\r\nsample, and if kept at the ordinary storage temperatures, it might\r\nkeep for days. The test when used for market milk should be\r\ninterpreted with this in mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Curd Test.\r\n\r\nThe curd obtained from milk containing many gas-forming bacteria.\r\nThe irregular, angular holes are mechanical, due to the imperfect\r\nfusion of the pieces of curd.]\r\n\r\nIf the results are to be of any value, the test must be made with\r\ncare to avoid all sources of error; the tester must know that the\r\nbacteria causing the gas and bad flavors in the sample were\r\noriginally present in the milk at the time the sample was taken, and\r\nthat they have not come from the containers used or from other\r\nsources. To insure these conditions the jars must be thoroughly\r\ncleaned and then sterilized just before use by placing them in cold\r\nwater and bringing them to the boiling point, or sterilized by a\r\nthorough steaming. The sample of milk of a patron must be taken so\r\nas to avoid contamination from the milk of the other patrons. This\r\ncan best be done by filling the jars as the milk is poured from the\r\npatron's can into the weigh can. In cutting the curds, the knife\r\nused must be dipped in hot water between each test to cleanse the\r\nsame. In short, the test should be carried out with great care so\r\nthat the tester is certain of the results obtained.\r\n\r\nOther tests for the bacteriological condition of milk will be\r\ndescribed in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n=Overcoming abnormal fermentations.= The lactic acid bacteria are\r\noften looked upon as normal to milk, and it is certain that they are\r\nto be classed as harmful, only as they injure the keeping qualities\r\nof milk. In milk designed for butter and cheese their presence is\r\nnecessary. At times these desirable forms of bacteria may disappear,\r\nand be replaced by less desirable types. In one case it was observed\r\nthat the usual lactic bacteria had been replaced in a cheese factory\r\nsupply by an acid-forming organism that produced an intensely bitter\r\ntaste in the milk, thus rendering the cheese of no value. When such\r\nharmful forms appear, they must be overcome, and the normal types of\r\nbacteria replaced. A thorough cleaning of the milk utensils,\r\nattention to the cattle and all places from which such bacteria may\r\nfind their way into the milk is often sufficient to cause a\r\ndisappearance of the trouble. If the acid-forming bacteria have\r\ndisappeared, the inoculation of the milk with cultures in ways later\r\nto be discussed is often of advantage. At times more stringent\r\nmeasures must be employed in order to destroy the harmful bacteria,\r\nsuch as the use of strong disinfectants.\r\n\r\n=Disinfection and disinfectants.= If any building or room becomes\r\ninfected with disease-producing bacteria, or if organisms causing\r\nabnormal fermentations become established in a factory, the use of a\r\ndisinfectant that will destroy with great rapidity the life of\r\nbacteria is necessary. The disinfection of all types of dairy\r\napparatus and utensils can be accomplished by thorough cleansing,\r\nand by the use of steam or boiling water. The disinfection of rooms\r\nand stables cannot be so readily accomplished.\r\n\r\nConsideration must always be given to the resistance of the organism\r\nit is desired to destroy. Those that form spores are very resistant\r\ntoward all chemical agents, while those that do not produce these\r\nresistant bodies are easily killed. In the dairy and factory, it is\r\noften necessary to destroy the organisms that develop in decomposing\r\norganic matter. Here, as in all disinfection, a thorough cleaning\r\nshould precede the application of any disinfectant. Some chemicals\r\nact as deodorants, _i.e._, destroy the offensive odor, without\r\nremoving the cause. It is impossible effectually to destroy bacteria\r\nembedded in a mass of organic matter, and through the removal of the\r\nmaterial itself, the larger part of the bacteria will be removed.\r\nThe disinfectant then comes in direct contact with the surface to be\r\ndisinfected, consequently destroys the bacteria not removed in the\r\ncleaning.\r\n\r\nAll places in which dairy work of any kind is done should be\r\nprovided with an abundance of light and air. The direct rays of\r\nthe sun have a powerful disinfecting action, and light makes evident\r\naccumulations of dirt that in a darker room would be unnoticed.\r\nVentilation keeps the rooms dry and thus prevents the growth of mold\r\nand the development of a musty odor.\r\n\r\nDisinfectants are divided into two classes: (1) solid materials used\r\nin suspension, or in watery solutions; (2) gaseous substances. The\r\nlatter are preferable for room disinfection when their use is\r\npermissible, for the gas penetrates to every part of the space, even\r\ninto the cracks. Gaseous disinfectants can only be used when the\r\nspace is tightly closed, for the gas must be confined for several\r\nhours in the room, in order to make the process effective. Such\r\ndisinfectants can often be used to advantage in the treatment of\r\nrefrigerators and cheese rooms to destroy mold spores. In less\r\ntightly closed spaces, reliance must be placed on the use of the\r\nsolid or liquid disinfectants.\r\n\r\n=Lime.= Quick lime or stone lime has a considerable disinfecting\r\naction. On exposure to the air, quick lime becomes air slaked, and\r\nthen has no disinfecting action whatever. Water-slaked lime used in\r\nthe form of white wash, lime water, or the powder is effective.\r\nAir-slaked and water-slaked lime are similar in appearance, but a\r\ndifference can be noted by placing a particle of each on the tongue;\r\nthe air-slaked tastes like chalk while the water-slaked material\r\ncauses the tongue to burn.\r\n\r\nWhite wash is one of the most effective agents that can be used in\r\nthe disinfection of barns, milkrooms, etc. Besides being a fairly\r\nstrong disinfectant, it has a tendency to absorb odor, it encrusts\r\nthe walls and lightens the interior of rooms. It can be applied with\r\na brush or with a spray pump.\r\n\r\n=Carbolic acid and cresol compounds.= These substances are among the\r\ncheapest and best disinfectants, but their use in the dairy is not\r\nadvisable, on account of the penetrating and lasting odor. They can\r\nbe used to advantage on the farm. Some of the proprietary compounds,\r\nas Zenoleum, Kresol, etc., are easily applied, since they mix\r\nreadily with water in all proportions, forming a milky-white\r\nemulsion that can be easily applied. They are less caustic and less\r\npoisonous than carbolic acid.\r\n\r\n=Corrosive sublimate.= Corrosive sublimate is the most efficient\r\ndisinfectant under ordinary conditions. It is such an intense poison\r\nthat it must be used with caution in places to which stock have\r\naccess, or in the dairy. A solution of one part of the salt to a\r\nthousand parts of water (half ounce to 4 gallons of water) is the\r\nstandard generally used.\r\n\r\nFor gutters, drains, and waste pipes in factories, ferrous sulphate\r\n(green vitriol), and copper sulphate (blue vitriol), can be used to\r\nadvantage. They are to be classed as deodorants rather than as true\r\ndisinfectants. Since they have no odor of their own, they can be\r\nused in any amount in the dairy.\r\n\r\n=Sulphur= can be used to advantage in the destruction of mold spores\r\nin cheese rooms, but the effect of the vapors of burning sulphur on\r\ngerm life is relatively slight, unless there is an abundant supply\r\nof moisture in the air of the enclosed space, in which case\r\nsulphurous acid is formed which has a much greater effect. To have\r\nthe desired effect sulphur should be burned at the rate of three\r\npounds to each one thousand cubic feet of space, and the room kept\r\nsealed for at least twelve hours. If the sulphur is placed in an\r\niron kettle which is set in a vessel of water, danger from fire\r\nwill be avoided, and the heat generated by the burning sulphur will\r\nevaporate sufficient water to increase the effect of the fumes.\r\n\r\n=Formalin.= Another disinfectant that may be used as a liquid or as a\r\ngas is formalin, which is a watery solution of the gas,\r\nformaldehyde. It is much more powerful in its action than sulphur,\r\nand has a great advantage over corrosive sublimate and other strong\r\ndisinfectants in that it is not so poisonous to animals as it is to\r\nbacteria and fungi.\r\n\r\nIt can be used as a solution (one to five per cent) for the washing\r\nof woodwork, or for the treatment of any object, since it has no\r\ncorrosive action. It can also be employed as a gaseous disinfectant\r\nfor the treatment of rooms. It is most conveniently applied by\r\nsuspending large cloths in the room and spraying them with the\r\nsolution, then closing the room for a number of hours.\r\n\r\n=Bleaching powder.= Chloride of lime, or bleaching powder as it is\r\noften called, is a good disinfectant, as well as a deodorant. It is\r\nused as a wash in the proportion of four to six ounces to a gallon\r\nof water. It must be used with care in factories since the free\r\nchlorine that is given off has a penetrating odor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in a previous chapter that milk becomes\r\ncontaminated with a multitude of bacteria not only on the farm where\r\nit is produced, but during the various stages prior to its use. Many\r\nof the bacteria which find their way into milk are readily able to\r\ndevelop, and by their growth, render the milk unfit, or even harmful\r\nfor human food. With the most stringent precautions that can\r\nreasonably be taken, it is impossible to avoid all contamination;\r\nhence, all grades of milk will soon spoil, unless some means of\r\npreservation is employed. Indeed, of all the foods classed as\r\nperishable, milk is the one that most rapidly deteriorates. Produced\r\nunder ordinary conditions, it is unfit for ordinary use in a few\r\nhours if kept at 70° F.\r\n\r\nThere are three possible ways by which milk may be preserved: (1)\r\nThe removal of bacteria that have gained entrance to it; (2) The\r\nprevention of growth of the contained bacteria; (3) The destruction\r\nof the contained organisms. In practice at least two and sometimes\r\nall of these methods are employed. The prevention of contamination,\r\na subject discussed in Chapter III is in reality one of the most\r\nefficient means of preserving milk. In milk production, as\r\nelsewhere, prevention is preferable to cure. Milk produced under\r\nsuch conditions that its germ content is but a few thousand per\r\ncubic centimeter will keep much longer than that handled in the\r\nordinary manner.\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be supposed that any method by which dirt is\r\nremoved from milk would improve the keeping quality of milk, due to\r\nthe reduction of bacteria, yet while the straining of the milk at\r\nthe time of milking removes dirt of various kinds, it does not\r\nappreciably enhance the keeping quality, owing to the fact that the\r\nbacteria adherent to the dirt particles are washed off in straining,\r\nand pass through the pores of the strainer.\r\n\r\n=Filtration of milk.= It is possible to remove all bacteria from water\r\nand other fluids and thus render them sterile by passing through\r\nfilters of unglazed porcelain. This process can not be used with\r\nmilk for the fat globules are larger than the bacteria (see Fig. 6)\r\nand any process that would remove the latter would also remove the\r\nformer. The term \"filtration\" is applied to a process used in some\r\nEuropean cities for the removal of the insoluble dirt that has been\r\nintroduced into the milk. Suitable containers are filled with layers\r\nof coarse sand at the bottom and with finer sand at the top. The\r\nmilk is introduced at the bottom and is forced upward through the\r\nsand. Such a filtering process is a very efficient means of removing\r\nthe dirt; but unless the filters are kept scrupulously clean, the\r\nbacteria are likely to grow in the filtering material, so that the\r\nnumber of organisms in the milk may actually be increased by the\r\nfiltering process. It is necessary to remove the sand daily and\r\nthoroughly wash and sterilize the same. The extra care required in\r\nkeeping these sand filters in sanitary condition has been the great\r\nobjection to their employment in this country. Filters of other\r\nmaterial such as cellulose have been employed but with no marked\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n=Clarifying milk.= A much more efficient and less troublesome means of\r\nremoving the insoluble foreign particles from milk is to pass it\r\nthrough a cream separator, allowing the cream and skim milk to mix\r\nin the same container. The slime that collects on the wall of the\r\nseparator bowl is made up of dirt, casein, bacteria, and the\r\ncellular debris from the interior of the udder. The bacteria are\r\nheavier than the milk serum, and would, therefore, be deposited on\r\nthe wall of the bowl were it not for other factors that in a measure\r\nprevent this. The movement of the fat toward the center of the bowl\r\ncarries into the cream a considerable proportion of the bacteria in\r\nthe milk. The slime will always contain many more bacteria than the\r\nmilk, but the per cent of bacteria thus removed is relatively low,\r\ndue to the small amount of slime obtained from the milk, so that the\r\nactual effect of clarification on the keeping quality of milk is\r\ninsignificant. The complete removal of all insoluble and therefore\r\nvisible dirt is, however, regarded of sufficient value to warrant\r\nthe use.\r\n\r\nMachines designed especially for the clarification of milk are now\r\nwidely used. They differ from the cream separator in that the milk\r\nis introduced at the outside of the bowl and hence there is no\r\nseparation of the fat from the serum. It is claimed that the removal\r\nof the dirt, cells from the interior of the udder and bacteria is as\r\nefficiently done as when the separator is used. The advantages\r\nclaimed for the machine are that it has no effect on the subsequent\r\ngravity creaming of the milk and that less power is demanded than\r\nfor the separator.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the consumer, all processes by which dirt is\r\nremoved from milk are objectionable, since they make the milk\r\nappear cleaner and better than it really is, the harm having been\r\ndone when the dirt with the adherent bacteria found its way into the\r\nmilk. The removal of the foreign matter that has been introduced\r\ninto the milk will have but little effect in reducing the number of\r\nbacteria, since a large part of the organisms will have been washed\r\noff the insoluble material. All of these processes improve the\r\nappearance of the milk but have little or no influence in increasing\r\nits keeping quality or its healthfulness.\r\n\r\n=Preservation by cold.= The only legitimate way of preventing the\r\ngrowth of bacteria in milk is by holding it at temperatures at which\r\nthe ordinary forms of bacteria cannot thrive. Bacterial growth is\r\ngreatly checked at temperatures approximating 50° F., or below,\r\nalthough certain types multiply at the freezing point or slightly\r\nabove. If food products are actually congealed, no germ growth\r\noccurs, and they may be kept quite indefinitely, but this process\r\ncannot be successfully applied to milk, as the fat and casein are\r\nphysically changed, so that a normal emulsion can not again be made\r\nwhen the frozen milk is melted. The fat separates in visible masses\r\nas though the milk had been partially churned. On account of this\r\nfact milk must be stored at temperatures above the freezing point.\r\nIn Denmark efforts have been made to preserve milk, that is to be\r\nshipped long distances, by freezing a portion of the milk, and\r\nplacing a block of the frozen milk in each can after cooling the\r\nmain mass of milk nearly to the freezing point. Even this method has\r\nnot proven practical, and at present reliance is placed on thorough\r\nchilling of the milk. At 32° F., the lactic bacteria cannot grow,\r\nbut other types, such as certain of the putrefactive forms grow\r\nslowly; the milk may, therefore, have no objectionable odor or taste\r\nand yet be swarming with bacteria. In cities the practice is\r\nfollowed of placing cream in cold-storage during the cooler periods\r\nof summer in preparation for an increased demand, during hot weather\r\nor on holidays. It seems probable that poisoning from ice cream may,\r\nat times, be due to the use of such cream.\r\n\r\n=Preservation by the use of antiseptics.= Many chemical substances\r\nprevent the growth of bacteria when added to food supplies; such\r\nsubstances thus used are called _preservatives_. In the past some of\r\nthese have been used in milk to a great extent, but at present, on\r\naccount of stringent pure food laws, they are employed only to a\r\nslight extent. There is a great temptation for the small milk dealer\r\nin the city to employ them to preserve the excess of milk from day\r\nto day, as through the use of a few cents worth of some preparation,\r\nmany dollars worth of milk may be kept from spoiling until it can be\r\nsold to the unsuspecting consumer.\r\n\r\nFormalin has been most widely used in milk because it is a most\r\nefficient preservative; it is cheap and cannot be detected by the\r\nconsumer, although it injures the digestibility of the casein. One\r\nounce will keep one thousand pounds of milk sweet for twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours. Borax, boric acid, and salicylic acid have also\r\nbeen used, but these substances must be employed in much larger\r\nquantities than formalin. Bicarbonate of soda has sometimes been\r\nused although it is not a true preservative. Its effect is based\r\nupon the neutralization of the acid produced by bacterial growth.\r\nThe treated milk does not taste sour so quickly, and the curdling of\r\nthe milk is also delayed.\r\n\r\nMany proprietary compounds for milk preservation have been placed on\r\nthe market in the past, but the use of all of these is illegal in\r\nmost states. The federal law also prohibits their use in all dairy\r\nproducts that pass into interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years a method for the preservation of milk was\r\nintroduced by a Danish engineer, Budde, which consists of adding to\r\nmilk a very small amount of peroxid of hydrogen which is a very\r\nefficient antiseptic. The peroxid is decomposed by some substance in\r\nthe milk; the products of decomposition being water and free oxygen.\r\nThe peroxid together with the application of heat at a comparatively\r\nlow temperature (122° F.) is sufficient to destroy the larger part\r\nof the bacteria in the milk. Practical difficulties are encountered\r\nin the commercial application, so that it is probable the process\r\nwill never be a commercial success.\r\n\r\nFor the preservation of composite samples of milk for analytical\r\npurposes, such as the Babcock test, strong disinfectants, as\r\ncorrosive sublimate, are employed. This material is very poisonous,\r\nand leaves the milk unchanged in appearance. Some coloring matter is\r\ntherefore usually mixed with the sublimate in making the\r\npreservative tablets, so as to render their use more conspicuous.\r\nCorrosive sublimate not only stops all bacterial growth, but quickly\r\ndestroys the life of the cells. Bichromate of potash is generally\r\nemployed in the preservation of composite samples for the Hart\r\ncasein test.\r\n\r\n=Destruction of bacteria in milk.= Actual destruction of the life of\r\nbacterial cells by heat is one of the most important ways for\r\npreserving milk. Heat easily destroys the vegetating, growing\r\nbacteria, while the spores, of which there are always a number in\r\nmilk, are very resistant. If, however, the growing organisms are\r\ndestroyed, the milk will keep much longer than if it had not been so\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nThe process of pasteurization was first used by the French\r\nbacteriologist, Pasteur, for the treatment of the wines of his\r\nnative district which were likely to undergo undesirable types of\r\nfermentations due to bacteria. From the wine industry it was applied\r\nin the brewing industry, and was later found to be of the greatest\r\nservice in the dairy industry. The process of pasteurization may be\r\nbriefly defined, as the heating of milk to temperatures, varying\r\nfrom 140° F. and upward for a longer or shorter time, and\r\nsubsequently cooling to a low temperature, so as to prevent the\r\ngermination of the spores that are not destroyed by the heating.\r\n\r\n=Effect of heat on milk.= When milk is heated it undergoes more or\r\nless profound changes, depending on the temperature and time of\r\nheating. Some of these changes are of practical importance, since\r\nthey are more or less evident, and objectionable to the consumer.\r\n\r\nIn raw milk the fat globules are largely found in larger or smaller\r\naggregates, rather than uniformly distributed throughout the serum.\r\nThe surface of a mass of fat globules is smaller in proportion to\r\nthe volume of the mass than is the case with single globules, hence\r\nglobule clusters encounter less resistance in their passage through\r\nthe serum, either as they rise to the surface in gravity creaming,\r\nor in the separator bowl. If these clusters are broken up, so\r\nthat the globules are uniformly distributed, the milk will cream\r\nmuch less rapidly and completely. In the process known as\r\n\"homogenization\" of milk, the individual fat globules are broken\r\ninto such small globules, that they cannot overcome the viscosity\r\nof the serum, and they remain distributed throughout the milk. In\r\nsuch cases, no cream rises, and even the cream separator is unable\r\nto remove the fat from such milk.\r\n\r\nIn selling bottled milk, it is highly desirable that the cream line\r\nshould show distinctly. In normal milk, this line forms in a few\r\nhours, but where milk is heated to a high temperature, and agitated\r\nat the same time, the clusters of fat globules are broken apart and\r\nthe creaming power injured. This physical change is dependent not\r\nonly on the temperature, but also on the time of exposure. A\r\nmomentary exposure at 160° F., or for 20 minutes at 145° F., is\r\nabout the maximum limit which can be applied to milk without\r\nmaterial injury to the creaming property.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Fat Globules in Raw Milk.\r\n\r\nIn raw milk the fat globules are in masses of varying sizes. These\r\nrise to the surface quickly in gravity creaming.]\r\n\r\nThe body or consistency of pasteurized cream may be restored by\r\nallowing the cream to stand for several days at low temperatures,\r\nor by the addition of a small amount of sucrate of lime. This\r\nsubstance, known to the dairy trade as \"viscogen,\" is made by adding\r\nto a thick solution of cane sugar, some freshly slaked lime. The\r\nsugar solution permits of the dissolving of a much larger amount of\r\nthe lime than is possible in water. When the liquid is allowed to\r\nsettle, the clear solution is then decanted off and is used at the\r\nrate of about one part to 100 to 150 parts of cream. The fat\r\nglobules are, by its action, brought into aggregates and the body of\r\nthe cream thus restored. Viscogen contains nothing that is at all\r\nharmful, but milk and cream to which it is added must be sold under\r\nsome distinctive name as \"visco-cream,\" since the laws of\r\npractically all states do not allow the addition of any substance\r\nwhatever to milk or cream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Fat Globules in Heated Milk.\r\n\r\nWhen milk is heated the masses of globules are broken up and fat\r\nglobules are uniformly distributed throughout the milk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Creaming of Milk.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder on the left contains raw milk; that in the center, milk\r\nheated to 140° F. for twenty minutes; on the right, milk heated to\r\n160° F. for twenty minutes. The dark line indicates the depth of the\r\ncream after twenty-four hours. The breaking up of the fat globule\r\nclusters delays greatly the rising of the cream.]\r\n\r\nHeated milk has a taste unlike that of raw milk; to one not\r\naccustomed to it the taste is objectionable. This change is due to\r\nsome extent to the expulsion of the carbon dioxide from the milk.\r\nThe insipid taste of boiled water is, in part, due to its freedom\r\nfrom carbon dioxide. The production of this cooked flavor is\r\ndependent upon the time and temperature of exposure. It has been\r\nclaimed that heated milk is less digestible than raw, and a\r\nconsiderable amount of experimental work has been done, both on\r\nanimals and children, in order to determine the relative\r\ndigestibility of heated and raw milk. The results obtained have been\r\ncontradictory. It is claimed that heated milk causes such diseases\r\nas rickets, scurvy and marasmus in children. It is probably true\r\nthat milk heated to the boiling point is less fitted as food for the\r\nyoung child than raw milk, but, on the other hand, it has not been\r\nproven that properly pasteurized milk is an unsuitable food for\r\nchildren. The best evidence has been accumulated in recent years, in\r\nmany of the large cities of this country and of Europe, where\r\npasteurized milk has been used with the greatest success in the\r\nfeeding of children of all ages.\r\n\r\nThe heated milk does not curdle readily when rennet is added due to\r\nthe precipitation of the lime salts by heat. The curdling power can\r\nbe restored by the addition of soluble lime salts or of acids.\r\n\r\n=Purpose of pasteurization.= There are two reasons for the\r\npasteurization of milk: (1) To improve the keeping quality; (2) To\r\ndestroy any pathogenic bacteria it may contain. The first may be\r\ncalled the economic reason; the second, the hygienic reason fur\r\npasteurization. In the selection of a proper pasteurizing\r\ntemperature, two factors must be taken into account: First, the\r\neffect of heat on milk, and second, the temperature necessary to\r\ndestroy those forms of bacteria that are of the greatest importance,\r\nas far as the keeping properties are concerned, and the pathogenic\r\nbacteria that might possibly be present in the milk. The lactic\r\nacid bacteria are non-spore-bearing and are not resistant to heat.\r\nMost of them are destroyed when the milk is heated to 140° F. for\r\nfifteen minutes or to 160° F. for a moment. To insure proper keeping\r\nquality, somewhat higher temperatures must be employed, such as 145°\r\nto 150° F. for fifteen to twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nMilk pasteurized at these temperatures will, as a rule, undergo an\r\nacid fermentation in much the same manner as will raw milk. The rate\r\nwith which the acid develops is of course much slower than in the\r\nraw milk, due to the destruction of 95 to 99 per cent of the\r\nacid-forming bacteria. If the milk has been pasteurized at higher\r\ntemperatures, the acid fermentation may not appear. The spores of\r\nthe spore-bearing organisms will be left; these may germinate and\r\ncause their characteristic change in milk, which, as previously\r\nnoted, is usually a sweet-curdling or a digesting fermentation.\r\nSince the changes they produce in the milk are not evident at first,\r\nit might be used as food even though it was so far advanced in\r\ndecomposition as to be undesirable or even harmful as food. Indeed\r\none of the objections urged against pasteurization is that it\r\ndestroys the natural safe guard, the acid-forming bacteria. Many\r\npeople are so accustomed to use this as the indication of spoiled\r\nmilk that they will use milk long after it should be used if it does\r\nnot show an acid fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe butyric acid organisms are spore forming and may at times\r\nproduce their characteristic fermentation in pasteurized milk. The\r\nmilk shows gas formation and develops an objectionable odor.\r\n\r\nThe pathogenic bacteria most likely to be present in the milk are\r\nthe typhoid and the tubercle organisms. The typhoid bacillus is no\r\nmore resistant to heat than the ordinary acid-forming bacteria, and\r\nall milk that has been heated, so as to impart to it satisfactory\r\nkeeping properties, will certainly be free from typhoid bacilli. It\r\nhas sometimes been asserted that the tubercle bacillus is very\r\nresistant to heat; some claiming that it is necessary to heat milk\r\nto 200° F. in order to destroy it. Other experimenters have asserted\r\nthat lower temperatures would suffice, but the temperatures were\r\nstill above those at which the milk is physically and chemically\r\nchanged by the heating process. More recent work has shown that not\r\nall sources of error were avoided in the earlier attempts to\r\ndetermine the thermal death point of the tubercle bacillus, as, for\r\nexample, it has been shown by the authors that the \"scalded film\"\r\nthat forms on the surface of milk when heated in an open vessel will\r\nprotect the bacteria imbedded in it. It has also been shown by the\r\nauthors that a temperature of 140° F., for twenty minutes or 160° F.\r\nfor one minute will destroy the tubercle bacilli in milk, in case\r\nthe heating is done with sufficient thoroughness to insure all\r\nparticles of the milk being heated to the same temperature for these\r\nperiods of time.\r\n\r\nThe pasteurization of milk can be done in such a manner as to impart\r\nto it good keeping qualities and to insure its freedom from\r\npathogenic bacteria, and yet not impair its physical and chemical\r\nproperties, but much of the so-called pasteurized milk placed on the\r\nmarket is not treated in accordance with proper hygienic methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--The Pott's Discontinuous Pasteurizer.\r\n\r\nThe milk is placed in the inner compartment. For heating and\r\ncooling, hot or cold water is passed between the jackets.]\r\n\r\n=Methods of pasteurization.= In order to destroy the bacteria in milk,\r\nit is necessary that the milk be heated for a varying time dependent\r\nupon the temperature employed. A lower temperature for a\r\nconsiderable period may exert the same effect on the bacteria as a\r\nhigher temperature for a shorter time. In practice, two types of\r\npasteurizing machines are employed, depending on the temperature at\r\nwhich the milk is to be treated. The discontinuous machines or\r\nintermittently operated pasteurizers are those in which the milk is\r\nheated for any desired time at any temperature. Such machines\r\nconsist of jacketed containers the inner receptacle being filled\r\nwith milk, while the outer space between the walls is filled with\r\ncirculating hot water or steam. The milk is kept agitated by the\r\nrotation of the machine. After it is heated, it is cooled in the\r\nsame container by replacing the hot water first with cold water,\r\nthen ice water. The disadvantage of this process is that the\r\ncapacity of the machine is limited which precludes its use in places\r\nwhere large quantities of milk or cream are handled; for the\r\npasteurization of limited quantities, it is very successful, as\r\nevery particle of milk or cream is under the direct control of\r\nthe operator and may be thoroughly and efficiently treated.\r\n\r\nAs pasteurization was introduced for the treatment of market milk,\r\nand for the preparation of cream for butter, machines have been\r\ndevised which permit large quantities, as thousands of pounds, to be\r\nhandled per hour. It is evident under these conditions that the milk\r\nmust be heated for only a short time, and hence a higher temperature\r\nmust be employed. These machines are called \"continuous flow\"\r\npasteurizers since the milk passes through them in a constant\r\nstream. The period of exposure is very short, in some only a few\r\nseconds; hence, they are sometimes called \"flash\" pasteurizers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--A Continuous Pasteurizer.\r\n\r\nThe milk is exposed but a short time since it flows through the\r\nheater in a constant stream.]\r\n\r\nAll machines of this type possess the obvious disadvantage that it\r\nis impossible to heat all of the milk for a uniform period. The milk\r\nin contact with the walls of the machine flows much more slowly than\r\nin the middle of the stream, just as the current near the bank is\r\nless rapid than in mid-stream. In none of the machines yet devised\r\nhave the designers been able to overcome this disadvantage. In a\r\ntest of one of the most widely used pasteurizers of this type, it\r\nwas found that some of the milk passed through the machine in 15\r\nseconds, while the larger part of it was held for about 30 seconds,\r\nand some as long as forty-five to sixty seconds. If the temperature\r\nemployed had been such as to destroy the bacteria in that part of\r\nthe milk heated for the minimum time, hygienic safety would be\r\nassured, but in order to avoid injuring the physical properties of\r\nthe milk, the tendency is to use as low a temperature as possible,\r\nso that the milk heated for the minimum time may often contain\r\norganisms that have passed through the machine uninjured.\r\n\r\nMany devices have been proposed for the heating and cooling of the\r\nmilk. In many of the pasteurizers, the milk flows in a thin stream\r\nover a metal surface, on the opposite side of which is the heating\r\nagent, usually steam; while in others, the milk is allowed to flow\r\nthrough a vat in which revolve a series of discs into which steam is\r\npassed. The discs are of considerable size; thus, making a large\r\nheating surface; the milk is thus heated quickly, and is constantly\r\nstirred by the rotation of the heating discs. In other types the\r\nmilk passes into the bottom of a chamber in which a dasher revolves\r\nat a rapid rate. This catches the milk, throwing it in a thin film\r\nonto the wall of the chamber, which is heated with steam on the\r\nopposite side. From such machines, of which the Fjord, the Jensen,\r\nand the Reid machines are types, the milk may be forced to a\r\nconsiderable height. These are widely used in this country for the\r\npasteurization of milk and cream for butter making.\r\n\r\nMilk that has been heated must be cooled at once by the use of cold\r\nwater and ice. In order to economize in the use of both steam and\r\ncooling agents, the so-called regenerative machines were devised.\r\nThe essential feature of these machines lies in the fact that the\r\ncold milk inlet and the hot milk outlet are on opposite sides of a\r\nsingle partition; thus the inflowing cold milk is partially heated\r\nby means of the already treated hot milk which it is desired to\r\ncool.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the disadvantages of the continuous machines,\r\nviz., lack of control, an apparatus has recently been devised which\r\ncan handle large quantities of milk, heating the same to any\r\ntemperature for any desired time. In such a machine the milk is\r\nfirst heated in a continuous heater, and is then passed into large\r\ntanks in which it is allowed to remain for the desired time, and\r\nfrom which it flows over the coolers. Such an apparatus is called a\r\n\"holding\" machine, and is probably the most feasible type of\r\npasteurizer now on the market, when all factors are considered. In\r\nsome of the continuous machines, an attempt is made to accomplish\r\nthe same result, by building the machine so that the milk requires\r\nfifteen to twenty minutes for passage through the machine, but in\r\nall such cases the same disadvantage of variation in rate of flow,\r\nas in other continuous flow type of machines obtains.\r\n\r\n=Tests of pasteurizing machines.= It is possible for the operator to\r\ntest the rate of flow in a machine, so as to determine whether all\r\nof the milk is heated for a uniform time. This is done most easily\r\nin the following manner: The machine is first filled with water,\r\nheating the same to the desired temperature, and regulating the rate\r\nof flow as it would be if milk was used. The flow of water is then\r\nturned off, and a stream of milk containing a known per cent of fat\r\nadmitted to the machine. The time elapsing between the admission of\r\nmilk to the machine, and that at which the first sign of turbidity\r\nis noted at the outlet, will be the minimum period necessary for any\r\nportion of the milk to flow through the machine. At frequent\r\nintervals thereafter, samples of the outflowing liquid may be\r\ncollected, noting the time at which each sample is taken. The\r\npercentage of fat in the various samples is determined by the\r\nBabcock test; at the moment when all of the water has been removed,\r\nthe sample taken will show the same fat content as the milk used.\r\nThe samples taken previous to this will show a lower fat test,\r\ndependent upon the relative amount of water and milk. In this\r\nmanner, the minimum, the maximum, and the average period of exposure\r\nof milk in the machine tested, can be determined with exactness.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying table gives results that were obtained in the\r\ntesting of one of the continuous types of machines. The machine in\r\nquestion required about three hundred pounds of milk to fill it and\r\nwas supposed to handle 1,000 pounds per hour. Thus theoretically it\r\nshould require twenty minutes for any portion of the milk to pass\r\nthrough the machine. As will be seen from the data, some of the milk\r\npassed through within seven minutes after the water was shut off and\r\nthe milk turned on. The figures also show that not all of the water\r\nhad been replaced by the milk in even 45 minutes. In actual practice\r\nlike results will be obtained, and a portion of the milk will be\r\nheated to the temperature employed but a short time. In this, the\r\nvegetating bacteria will not be wholly destroyed.\r\n\r\n  =========================================================\r\n   Trial  |        |Per cent of fat in milk coming from\r\n          |        |    machine at following times\r\n          |Per cent|---------------------------------------\r\n          |  of fat|           MINUTES\r\n          | in milk|---------------------------------------\r\n          |        |  7 | 11 | 15 | 19 | 23 | 27 | 36 | 47\r\n  --------+--------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n  No. I   |   4.0  | 0.2| 0.8| 1.6| 2.0| 2.4| 2.6|    |\r\n  No. II  |   3.8  | 0.2| 0.6| 1.5| 1.8| 2.2| 2.6| 3.0| 3.4\r\n  No. III |   3.5  | 0.7| 1.9| 2.4| 2.8| 2.8| 3.0| 3.4| 3.4\r\n  =========================================================\r\n\r\n=Pasteurization of small quantities of milk.= It is often desirable to\r\ntreat a small quantity of milk for home use, in which case the\r\ncommercial types of pasteurizers are out of the question. This\r\ntreatment can be done in a number of ways, consideration always\r\nbeing paid to the manner of heating which should be done under such\r\nconditions, as have been shown to be necessary for efficient\r\npasteurization. Milk may be heated in tall, narrow cans which are\r\nplaced in hot water. In the household, milk may be treated by\r\nplacing the filled bottle in a pail having a false bottom so the\r\nbottle shall not be broken when the pail is placed on the stove. The\r\npail should be filled with water so that its level is about the same\r\nas that of the milk. The water is then heated to the desired\r\ntemperature, maintained for the requisite period of time, and is\r\nthen cooled as rapidly as possible. During the heating, the mouth of\r\nthe bottle should be covered, either with an inverted glass tumbler,\r\nor the paper cap may be left in place, simply punching a small hole\r\nthrough it so as to permit of the insertion of a thermometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--A Pasteurizer for Use in the Home.\r\n\r\nA milk bottle with a tumbler for a cover. The cover prevents the\r\nformation of the \"scalded layer\" on the milk during the heating and\r\nalso protects the mouth of the bottle from dust.]\r\n\r\n=Efficiency of pasteurizing.= It is easy to destroy over 99 per cent\r\nof the bacteria present by the use of any of the modern types of\r\nmachines. The number remaining after treatment will be largely\r\ndependent, other things being equal, upon the number of bacteria\r\nbefore pasteurization. The pasteurizing process is not one by which\r\npoor milk can be changed into good milk, nor is it legitimate to use\r\nthe process in place of cleanliness, as is sometimes done. There is\r\na legitimate field for the process in the handling of market milk,\r\nas well as in the creamery; but it should be used to improve the\r\nkeeping quality, and to insure the freedom of the milk from\r\npathogenic bacteria, when other protective measures have been\r\ncarried as far as possible under the prevailing conditions.\r\n\r\n=Details of process.= If the process is to be successful, due\r\nattention must be given to certain details. In the treatment of\r\nmarket milk, care should be taken to use only that in which the\r\nacidity has not materially increased. A fair standard is about 0.2\r\nper cent. High acid milk usually means old milk or dirty milk,\r\neither of which is very likely to contain many more spore-bearing\r\nbacteria than clean, fresh milk. The greater the number of spores,\r\nthe more rapidly will the pasteurized milk spoil. If it is possible\r\nto exercise any selection of milk prior to pasteurization, the rapid\r\ntest for determination of acidity will prove of great advantage.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to prevent fluctuations in the temperature to\r\nwhich the milk is heated. With varying steam pressure and variations\r\nin the rate of flow of milk, these fluctuations may be very\r\nconsiderable. Regulators are now made that will control the\r\ntemperature within narrow limits.\r\n\r\nIn all pasteurized milk as it flows from the machine, there will\r\nremain some living bacteria. The spores will not be destroyed by any\r\npasteurizing process, and under commercial conditions, vegetating\r\nbacteria are also present. If the milk is not quickly chilled after\r\nheating, these forms will grow, and their development is\r\nparticularly hastened by the destruction of the lactic bacteria, the\r\nacid of which would otherwise hold them in check. The result is\r\nthat, unless immediately chilled, pasteurized milk spoils almost as\r\nrapidly as though it had not been heated at all. Efficient and rapid\r\ncooling are, therefore, as essential a portion of the process as the\r\nheating itself.\r\n\r\nCare should also be taken to protect the milk from contamination\r\nafter treatment. Every utensil with which it comes in contact should\r\nbe sterilized. The bottles should be thoroughly washed and\r\nsterilized and subsequently protected from dust until used.\r\n\r\n=Sterilization of milk.= It is possible to render milk sterile by the\r\nuse of temperatures above the boiling point of water, where it is\r\nheated in a closed vessel, in which steam under pressure is\r\ngenerated. Such milk is often found in the European markets. In our\r\nown country, the only milk of this kind is the so-called \"evaporated\r\nmilk.\" In this process sweet fresh milk is evaporated in vacuum pans\r\nto about one-third of the original volume. This is then placed in\r\ntin cans, which are treated, as in the canning of such vegetables as\r\npeas and corn, by heating the milk to 230° or 240° F. for a few\r\nminutes. In this process, the bacteria (spores as well as vegetating\r\nforms) are completely killed, and the milk acquires a brownish tint,\r\ndue to the caramelization of the sugar. The appearance of the\r\nproduct is very similar to cream, and previous to the passage of\r\nthe pure food law, it was sold as evaporated cream.\r\n\r\nCondensed milk is not wholly free from bacteria, but is sufficiently\r\nthick, by reason of its treatment so that the contained bacteria\r\ncannot grow. They remain dormant in the milk, but as soon as it is\r\ndiluted to a normal consistency, growth takes place, and the milk\r\nrapidly spoils. Condensed milk is prepared by adding cane sugar to\r\nfresh sweet milk, then evaporating the mixture to one-third the\r\noriginal volume, forming a semi-solid product. Syrups owe their\r\nkeeping qualities to the same factor, as condensed milk, _i.e._, the\r\nhigh consistency.\r\n\r\nMilk is also preserved by wholly evaporating the water, thus leaving\r\na dry powder, which on being mixed with water again will have much\r\nthe same properties as the original milk. Various methods have been\r\ndevised for the preparation of these milk powders, all of which have\r\nbeen patented by the inventors. If the powder is to be kept for long\r\nperiods, skim milk must be used, since the fat slowly undergoes\r\nchanges which cause it to have a rancid odor. These dry preparations\r\nare largely used by bakers in place of fresh milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA AND BUTTER MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the making of butter it is necessary to concentrate the milk fat\r\ninto a small volume. This process, known as creaming, may be\r\naccomplished by gravity, if the milk is allowed to stand\r\nundisturbed, the fat globules rising slowly to the surface. Much\r\nmore rapid separation may be secured, by placing the milk in a\r\nrapidly revolving container in which it is subjected to centrifugal\r\nforce, which causes the heavier parts of the milk to pass to the\r\noutside of the bowl, while the lighter part, the fat, collects at\r\nthe center of the revolving bowl. There is an enormous number of fat\r\nglobules in milk, over 5,000,000,000 in each cubic centimeter, and\r\nas these move through the milk serum, they carry with them many of\r\nthe bacteria. The cream is thus much richer in bacteria than is the\r\nskim milk, or even the milk before separation. Besides the\r\nmechanical separation in the manner described, the method of\r\ncreaming is of importance, in determining not only the number but\r\nalso the kind of bacteria in the cream.\r\n\r\n=Methods of creaming.= In the shallow-pan method of creaming, the milk\r\nis kept at ordinary room temperatures. These temperatures favor\r\nespecially the growth of the acid-forming bacteria. The milk is\r\nusually sour by the time the cream is removed from it; consequently,\r\nthe bacterial content of the cream is high. Moreover, the cream is\r\nexposed to air contamination, and is thus seeded with molds, and\r\nthose forms of bacteria that are always found in the air. The cream\r\nobtained in this manner is likely to contain not only numerous\r\nbacteria, but a great variety of forms, some of which undoubtedly\r\nare the cause of the poor keeping qualities of butter made from such\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nIn the more modern method of gravity creaming, in which the milk is\r\nplaced in deep narrow cans kept in cold water, the conditions are\r\nnot favorable for the growth of acid-forming bacteria. If the milk\r\nis produced under clean conditions, and is placed in cold water at\r\nonce, the bacterial content of the cream will be low, and it will be\r\nless likely to contain undesirable forms than the cream which is\r\nobtained from the shallow pans.\r\n\r\nIn separator cream the bacteria will be represented by the kinds\r\npresent in the milk at time of separation. If this milk is quite\r\nold, the cream will contain large numbers of bacteria; if, however,\r\nearly separation is made and the milk is clean, the bacterial\r\ncontent of the cream will be low.\r\n\r\n=Types of butter.= Butter may be divided into two types--acid or\r\nsour-cream, and sweet-cream, depending upon whether the cream is\r\nallowed to undergo the acid fermentation or not before it is\r\nchurned. In southern Europe, it is the custom to churn the cream as\r\nsweet as possible, and the resulting product possesses only the\r\nnatural, or primary milk flavor. To one accustomed to butter made\r\nfrom sour or ripened cream, this taste is flat, and if the butter is\r\nfree from salt, may remind one of grease. Sweet-cream butter has a\r\ndelicate flavor when it is made from good milk, and the taste for it\r\nis rapidly acquired. In some centers, as in Paris, the market\r\ndemands this type of butter quite exclusively.\r\n\r\nIf the cream is allowed to undergo the acid fermentation before\r\nchurning, the butter has a much higher degree of flavor and one that\r\ndiffers materially in kind. Under primitive methods, it was\r\ndifficult to keep the cream sweet until it could be churned. On the\r\nsmall farm with gravity creaming in shallow vessels and infrequent\r\nchurning, the cream was certain to be sour when churned.\r\nUndoubtedly, the making of butter from sour cream came into use\r\nbecause of its greater convenience; people became accustomed to\r\nsour-cream butter, and at the present time it is used in the greater\r\npart of the world, and is the type made in all of the great dairy\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n=Ripening of cream.= In modern dairy practice the souring of the cream\r\nis called the _ripening_ process, and is, where the best methods are\r\nemployed, largely under the control of the butter maker. The changes\r\nthat go on in the ripening process are the same as have been\r\ndiscussed in the acid fermentation of milk. The increase in acid is\r\naccompanied by an enormous increase in the number of bacteria; the\r\nripe cream will contain hundreds of millions of bacteria in each\r\ncubic centimeter. The effect of this germ life is to improve or\r\ninjure the butter, depending upon the class of bacteria to which it\r\nbelongs. The problem of the modern butter maker is to control the\r\nkinds of bacteria growing in the cream.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which cream is held during the ripening process\r\nis favorable to the growth of the acid-forming bacteria; hence, in\r\nripe cream, they are practically the only kind of bacteria to be\r\nfound. It must be remembered however, that there are different\r\nclasses of acid-forming organisms, some of which produce desirable\r\nflavors, while others are distinctly harmful.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of flavor of butter is, in a general way, directly\r\nrelated to the amount of acid that is formed in the cream. A low\r\nacidity at time of churning is usually associated with a mild\r\nflavor, while a higher degree of acidity, up to a certain point,\r\nimparts a more pronounced flavor to the product. If cream is\r\nover-ripened, the quality of the flavor is seriously impaired.\r\n\r\nIn determining the acidity of cream, a definite volume is taken, and\r\nthe acidity determined by titration, expressing the results as such\r\na per cent of lactic acid. Manifestly, the amount of fat in the\r\ncream influences the apparent per cent of acidity. The acidity will\r\nnot usually exceed 0.5 to 0.7 per cent, but in reality the serum\r\nwill contain more than this, as the acid is formed in the serum, the\r\nbutter fat having no role whatever. In a very rich cream, 40 to 50\r\nper cent fat, it is impossible to develop more than 0.4 to 0.5 per\r\ncent of acidity, and the flavor of the butter will be low, because\r\nof the relation between the amount of acid and fat, while in a thin\r\ncream having the same acidity, the ratio between the amounts of fat\r\nand acid will be very different. For example, in one hundred pounds\r\nof 50 per cent cream of 0.5 per cent acidity there will be one-half\r\npound of acid and fifty pounds of fat; in the same quantity of cream\r\ncontaining 20 per cent of fat and having an acidity of 0.5 per cent\r\nthere will be one-half pound of acid to twenty pounds of fat. The\r\nflavor of the butter from the rich cream will be quite different in\r\nintensity from that made from the thinner cream.\r\n\r\nThe acidity of cream cannot be determined with any degree of\r\naccuracy by the taste or odor. Every butter maker should have some\r\nmethod of determining the degree of acidity in his cream, so that he\r\nmay better control the flavor of his product. Several methods have\r\nbeen devised for this purpose and the necessary apparatus is sold by\r\nall dairy supply houses.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the ripening of the cream is shown not only in the\r\nflavor of the product, but in a number of other ways. Sour cream\r\nchurns more easily, and more exhaustively than does sweet cream. It\r\nis supposed that the fat globules are surrounded by a film of\r\nalbuminous material which prevents their coalescing readily. During\r\nthe ripening process, the action of the acid apparently dissolves\r\nthis enveloping substance, and the globules cohere more easily in\r\nthe churning process.\r\n\r\nWhen raw cream is used the ripened-cream butter keeps better than\r\nthat made from sweet cream. In sweet cream there are few lactic\r\nbacteria, the majority of the bacteria present being of various\r\nkinds, many of which may be injurious, so far as the keeping quality\r\nis concerned. In sour-cream butter the lactic bacteria make up over\r\n99 per cent of the bacteria present, and their presence tends to\r\nprevent the development of undesirable non-acid forms.\r\n\r\n=Source of butter flavor.= The flavor of ripened-cream butter has been\r\nshown to be directly connected with the acid-fermentation of the\r\ncream. The amount of lactic acid formed from the sugar fermented is\r\ndependent upon the kind of bacteria present. The acid-producing\r\norganisms that are desirable from the standpoint of the butter maker\r\nform comparatively small amounts of other by-products, but these\r\nundoubtedly affect the flavor of the butter. As fats have the power\r\nof absorbing odors, the butter fat absorbs some of the by-products\r\nof the acid fermentation, thus acquiring a certain aroma and\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the cream be ripened, in order to have the\r\nfat acquire a flavor, for if sweet cream is churned with a\r\nconsiderable proportion of sour milk, the butter will have much the\r\nsame flavor, both as to intensity and kind, as though the cream had\r\nbeen allowed to sour naturally. A process of butter making known as\r\nthe LeClair method is based on this principle. The flavor-producing\r\nsubstances can also be absorbed by the butter after it is churned,\r\nby working the butter in contact with sour milk. Attempts have been\r\nmade to add pure lactic acid to the cream, instead of allowing the\r\nacid to be formed by the bacteria, but while the physical effect on\r\nthe cream is the same, the flavor and aroma of the butter are\r\ndeficient, because the acid itself does not supply the necessary\r\naromatic products. This emphasizes the importance of the by-products\r\nof the acid fermentation other than the lactic-acid.\r\n\r\nIn the past numerous attempts have been made to find organisms that\r\nmight be added to the cream, in order to produce the delicate flavor\r\ncharacteristic of the best type of butter. Some bacteriologists have\r\nclaimed that the source of the flavor-giving substance was to be\r\nfound in the decomposition products of the nitrogenous constituents\r\nof the milk. None of these attempts have stood the test of practical\r\nuse in creameries, and it has been demonstrated that the finest type\r\nof butter can be made by the use of lactic bacteria alone. Formerly,\r\nwhen butter was made wholly from cream soured under natural\r\nconditions, a much higher degree of flavor was developed. Under\r\npresent market demands, a less pronounced flavor is desired, a\r\ncondition more readily met by the use of modern methods.\r\n\r\n=Importance of butter flavor.= The importance of flavor in determining\r\nthe commercial value of butter is evidenced by the relatively high\r\nvalue placed upon this factor in scoring, viz., flavor, 45 points;\r\nbody or texture, 25 points; color 15; salt 10; and package 5 points.\r\nThe factors on which butter is judged, are with the exception of\r\nflavor, wholly under the control of the maker, but as the production\r\nof flavor is dependent on the kind of bacteria present in the cream,\r\nit is a far more difficult matter to control, and yet it is of the\r\nutmost importance in determining the value of the product.\r\n\r\nThe flavor of the butter is dependent on the quality of the cream.\r\nIf this is dirty and sour, the maker has little control over the\r\ntype of fermentation, and hence, little control of the flavor of the\r\nbutter. This has led in some cases to the grading of the cream,\r\nbasing the division on the acidity, flavor, and fat content. Such\r\npractice is entirely justifiable, as a better quality of butter can\r\nbe made from fresh, sweet cream than from that already fermented. It\r\nis noteworthy that the quality of butter has not improved since the\r\nintroduction of the centralizer system, in which cream is shipped\r\nfor long distances.\r\n\r\n=Control of the type of fermentation.= In the older methods of butter\r\nmaking, there was little or no control of the type of fermentation\r\nthat took place in the cream. Where milk is produced under clean\r\nconditions, and kept at ordinary temperatures, it will generally\r\nundergo fermentation changes, due to the desirable type of\r\nacid-forming organisms. In milk, which is less carefully handled,\r\nthe undesirable bacteria are more abundant and the quality of the\r\nbutter of lower grade. When butter was made on the farm, before the\r\ndevelopment of the factory system, it was not a question of vital\r\nimportance whether the product was uniform from day to day, but\r\nwith the advent of the modern creamery, turning out thousands of\r\npounds of butter per day, and with the extension of the markets for\r\nthe product, the question of uniformity came to be of much\r\nimportance. A uniform product can be secured only by the control of\r\nthe type of fermentation in the cream, or by the control of the\r\nkinds of bacteria that cause the souring of the cream. Modern\r\nmethods of butter making have been devised on the basis of an\r\nimprovement in the ripening process.\r\n\r\n=Starters.= From the earliest practice of allowing the cream to stand\r\nuntil sufficient quantity had accumulated for churning, it was only\r\na step, but a most important one, to the addition of sour milk, sour\r\ncream, or butter milk, to hasten the ripening process. This was the\r\nbeginning of the modern starter. Experience demonstrated that the\r\naddition of these already fermented liquids exercised a desirable\r\neffect upon the production of butter flavor, even though, at that\r\ntime, the phenomenon of milk fermentation was not satisfactorily\r\nunderstood, and the relation of bacterial by-products to the\r\nproduction of flavor in butter was not recognized.\r\n\r\nAs a result of experience alone, improvements in the development of\r\nthe \"home made\" starter took place. By careful selection of clean\r\nmilk, and the natural fermentation of this under carefully\r\ncontrolled conditions, as well as the control of the temperature of\r\nthe cream during the ripening, improvement in the technique of cream\r\nripening gradually developed. More and more attention was given to\r\nthe preparation of the starter, and its propagation from day to day,\r\nunder conditions which would prevent its deterioration. This method\r\nof utilizing naturally fermented milk or cream was gradually\r\nextended, until it became almost universal in the larger\r\nbutter-producing districts.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 a more refined and scientific process was introduced by the\r\nDanish bacteriologist, Storch. Recognizing the fact that butter\r\nflavor was attributable to the development of the bacteria present\r\nin the ripening cream, he conceived the idea of isolating the\r\nvarious types of organisms found in milk and testing them as to\r\ntheir effect on the quality of flavor. Selection was then made of\r\nthe most favorable flavor-producing types, and these were propagated\r\nin suitable culture media, such as skim milk, which was rendered\r\nmore or less perfectly sterile by pasteurization or sterilization.\r\nUnder such conditions the addition of a selected ferment could be\r\nmade to the fresh cream, and so control the type of fermentation\r\nwhich occurred therein. An essential requisite in any organism used\r\nfor this purpose must be the ability to produce relatively large\r\namounts of acid rapidly at ordinary ripening temperatures, and also\r\nto form sufficient quantities of the proper flavor-producing\r\nsubstances to impart a suitable flavor to the butter fat. Such\r\nstarters are known as pure culture or commercial starters, and are\r\nprepared in both liquid and dry form. At present they are used to a\r\ngreater or less extent in all of the leading dairy districts.\r\n\r\nLiquid starters consist of a mass of sterile nutrient medium, milk\r\nor beef broth, inoculated with the pure culture. The dry starters\r\nare made by adding liquid cultures, containing the growing bacteria,\r\nto some absorbing material, such as milk sugar, milk powder, or\r\nstarch, the whole mass being dried at low temperatures, so as not to\r\ninjure the bacteria. Under such conditions the bacteria, exist in a\r\ndormant state, and are protected from their own by-products, to\r\nwhich they would be exposed if maintained in liquid cultures. The\r\nkeeping quality, therefore, of dry cultures, is much better than\r\nthat of liquid cultures.\r\n\r\nBy the use of the pure-culture starters, the butter maker is able to\r\nadd to his cream the same kind of bacteria from day to day, and the\r\nbutter will be more uniform than when the less constant home-made\r\nstarter is employed. In cream to which the starter is added, there\r\nare present a greater or less number of acid-forming bacteria,\r\ndepending upon the age of the cream, and upon the condition under\r\nwhich it was produced. These will grow during the ripening process,\r\nand the flavor of the product will be the result of the mixture of\r\nthe bacteria in the cream. The maker can not, therefore, be certain\r\nthat the addition of a pure culture to raw cream will effectively\r\ncontrol the type of fermentation. This can be secured only by first\r\ndestroying the existing bacteria in the cream, before the selected\r\nculture is added. Heating the cream accomplishes this; and in cream\r\nthus freed from the various kinds of bacteria, the butter maker can\r\ninsure the dominance of the desirable types, contained in the\r\npure-culture starter. If the cream can be obtained in a sweet\r\ncondition, the maker through this process of pasteurization, and the\r\nuse of pure cultures, secures almost perfect control over the type\r\nof fermentation that occurs in the cream, and thus exercises control\r\nover the degree and kind of flavor of the product. This most\r\nscientific type of butter making is now used by the most progressive\r\nbutter makers in the leading butter-producing regions of the world.\r\n\r\nPasteurization of the cream also distinctly improves the keeping\r\nquality of butter, a condition doubtless due to the freedom of the\r\nsame from organisms other than the lactic bacteria. This is a factor\r\nof as much importance as uniformity, because under modern business\r\nconditions, the surplus production must be kept in storage, and it\r\nis essential that the quality should not deteriorate materially\r\nduring this time.\r\n\r\n=Process of pasteurization for butter making.= In the pasteurization\r\nof market milk, it is necessary to take into account the effect of\r\nheating on the physical and chemical properties of the milk, and the\r\ndegree of heat that can be employed is limited. In pasteurizing\r\ncream for butter, there is no such limitation, and the cream may be\r\nheated to any temperature desired. In Denmark where the process of\r\npasteurization has been used most extensively, temperatures ranging\r\nfrom 176° F. to 190° F. are used. The machines are of the\r\n\"continuous flow\" type, and the cream rather than the whole milk is\r\ntreated. To prevent the spread of tuberculosis and other diseases,\r\nthe Danish government requires that all cream and milk be heated to\r\n176° F., before the skim milk or butter milk is returned to the\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nThe heating of the butter fat to high temperatures has an injurious\r\neffect on the texture of the butter, unless the cream is cooled to\r\n50° F., for a period of at least two hours previous to churning.\r\n\r\n=Propagation of starters.= As has been previously shown, the quality\r\nof butter depends on the kind of bacteria in the cream or in the\r\nstarter added. The commercial starters contain lactic acid bacteria\r\nthat have been selected with especial care; most of the starters now\r\nsold contain but a single kind of bacteria; hence, are often called\r\npure-culture starters. The package purchased contains but a small\r\nquantity, and before the starter can be used in the ripening of\r\ncream, it must be increased in amount. It must also be propagated\r\nfrom day to day so that a fresh starter shall be available daily for\r\naddition to the cream. The propagation of the starter must be done\r\nwith especial reference to keeping it in good condition and in as\r\nhigh a state of purity as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the past the starter was propagated, by adding the contents of\r\nthe bottle purchased to a small amount of milk that had been heated\r\nand cooled; this, if kept in a warm place, would be curdled in\r\ntwenty-four hours, and could be used for the inoculation of a large\r\nmass of milk, that had been treated in a like manner, and which,\r\nwhen curdled, was added to the cream; a small amount was saved for\r\nthe purpose of again inoculating a mass of milk that had been heated\r\nand cooled. Following this method it was very difficult to keep the\r\nculture from becoming contaminated with other forms of bacteria.\r\nMore recently the most successful butter makers have propagated the\r\nso-called \"mother starters\" in small vessels, and have used the\r\nlarger mass of starter for the inoculation of the cream alone.\r\n\r\nGlass vessels are preferable for the propagation of the mother\r\nstarters since they are impervious and through the transparent wall\r\nthe condition of the ripened starter can be more easily determined\r\nthan in a metal or earthenware vessel. An ordinary milk bottle with\r\nan inverted tumbler for a cover, to protect the starter from\r\ncontamination from the air, is a most convenient vessel.\r\n\r\nThe starters may be propagated either in whole or skim milk; the\r\nformer is preferable since, in most creameries, it can be more\r\neasily selected. The quality of the milk used has much to do with\r\nthe quality of the starter; it should be as fresh and clean as it\r\nis possible to obtain. The clean bottle should be filled half to\r\ntwo-thirds full, covered and heated in some manner so that the milk\r\nshall be at a temperature close to the boiling point for fifteen to\r\ntwenty minutes. The heating may be done by placing the bottles in\r\nwater, which is heated on a stove or by steam, or the bottles may be\r\nsubjected to streaming steam. The milk is cooled quickly and the\r\ncontents of the package purchased added and well mixed with the\r\nmilk. In the case of the dry starters, the mixing should be done\r\nwith especial care. The bottle is kept in a warm place and in\r\ntwenty-four to thirty-six hours, the milk should be curdled. A\r\nsecond bottle must be treated as before and inoculated from the\r\nfirst, and the process repeated daily since the bacteria must have\r\nfresh food, if they are to be maintained in good condition.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this, the maker must be able to maintain\r\nconstant conditions from day to day, especially with reference to\r\nthe amount of the ripened starter that is transferred to the fresh\r\nbottle of milk, and the temperature at which the bottles are kept. A\r\nspoon, arranged as shown in Fig. 31, enables one to carry a definite\r\namount of the ripened starter to the bottle of milk to be inoculated\r\nand a constant temperature box (Fig. 32) permits of the maintenance\r\nof the same temperature from day to day. Through careful supervision\r\nof these points, and by taking care at every step to avoid the\r\nintroduction of contaminating organisms, the purity of the culture\r\ncan be maintained, and the bacteria kept in a healthy condition.\r\n\r\nThe starter is used because of the acid-forming bacteria it\r\ncontains; it is said to be ripe and in the best condition for use at\r\nthe time it contains the greatest number of living bacteria. It\r\nhas been found by experiment that this is at the time the milk\r\ncurdles at ordinary temperature, or when the acidity is about\r\n0.6-0.7 per cent. If the acidity is allowed to increase to 0.8 or\r\n0.9 per cent, the number of bacteria will be less and a larger\r\namount of the starter must be used in order to ripen a definite\r\namount of cream in the desired time. The use of an overripe starter\r\nmay also have an injurious effect on the flavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Bottle for Mother Starters.\r\n\r\nA milk bottle with a tumbler for a cover and a spoon for inoculating\r\nthe other bottles enables the butter maker to propagate the starters\r\nwithout contamination.]\r\n\r\nThe ripened starter should be perfectly homogeneous, showing no\r\nbubbles of gas or free whey; the odor should be agreeable and the\r\nacid taste mild; on shaking, the curd should break up into a smooth,\r\ncreamy liquid free from lumps. This is especially important in the\r\nstarter that is to be added to the cream, since otherwise the\r\nstarter cannot be uniformly mixed with it and white specks of\r\ncurdled casein will be noted in the butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--An Incubating Chamber for Starters.\r\n\r\nThe inner compartment will hold a pail of water and the bottles for\r\nthe mother starters. The temperature can be kept at any desired\r\npoint by the use of warm or cold water. The four-inch space between\r\nthe walls is filled with hay or mineral wool.]\r\n\r\nThe firmness of the curd is not so dependent on the amount of acid\r\nformed as upon other factors. If the curd shrinks to any extent and\r\nthe whey is expressed, it is certain to produce a starter that will\r\ncontain lumps that cannot be broken up. With a pure culture of\r\nlactic bacteria, there is little difficulty in this regard, but as\r\nsoon as gas-forming bacteria are introduced, trouble is likely to\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIn the propagation of starters, it is always to be remembered that\r\nthe bacteria, although invisible to the eye, are living things, and\r\nunless conditions are favorable in every particular, it is\r\nimpossible to keep them in a healthy condition, so that growth in\r\nthe cream is rapid, producing the acid demanded for churning, and\r\nimparting to the butter the desired flavor, both as to degree and\r\nkind. No part of the daily routine of the butter maker should be\r\nperformed with more care than the preparation of the starters, both\r\nthe mother starters, and the larger one for addition to the cream.\r\nThe latter can best be made in one of the many forms of starter cans\r\nnow on the market, since by their use, the maker can heat and cool\r\nthe milk with little trouble, and can maintain the starter at any\r\ndesired temperature. Better starters cannot be made in them than by\r\nthe use of simple and improvised apparatus, but better results can\r\nbe obtained with the same expenditure of time and labor.\r\n\r\nIn the handling of the large starter, care should be used not to\r\noverripen, since the larger quantity is more likely to \"whey off\"\r\nthan is the smaller starter. Skim milk rather than whole should be\r\nused for this. It should be selected with care and heated to 200° F.\r\nfor thirty minutes. When it is impossible to secure fresh milk for\r\nstarter making purposes, either condensed skim milk or milk powder\r\nmay be used. The condensed milk is diluted with water until its\r\nvolume is about the same as the milk before concentration; the\r\nmixture is then treated the same as fresh milk, being heated and\r\ncooled before inoculation. In the case of milk powder, one part of\r\nthe powder is added to ten or twelve parts of water, allowed to\r\ndissolve as far as possible, and the mixture heated and cooled.\r\nEither of these liquids will give satisfactory starters; the cost\r\nhowever is high, and in most places milk can be obtained more\r\ncheaply. The inoculation and the temperature should be so\r\ncontrolled, as to ripen the starter at the time it is to be needed.\r\nThese conditions must be determined by the maker for himself. It\r\nshould be remembered that the bacteria grow much more rapidly, as\r\nthe temperature is increased; and hence, the amount of inoculation\r\nis dependent on the temperature at which the starter is to be kept.\r\n\r\nWhen the starter is propagated under practical conditions, it sooner\r\nor later deteriorates, either in acid production, or in flavor, and\r\na new pure culture must be procured from the manufacturer. It is\r\nimpossible to give a hard and fast rule as to the length of time a\r\nstarter can be kept in good condition. It will depend on how well\r\nthe maker satisfies the conditions necessary for maintaining its\r\npurity and strength. The use of imperfectly sterilized milk, or\r\ndirty utensils soon contaminates it; overripening is likely to\r\ninjure the flavor. One of the most frequent troubles encountered is\r\nthe appearance of a slimy or ropy condition in the starter, although\r\nthe acidity developed may be normal and the flavor desirable. It has\r\nbeen found that this condition is not necessarily due to\r\ncontamination, as was considered true in the past, but rather to\r\nsome change in the lactic bacteria themselves. If the propagation is\r\ncontinued, the slimy condition will often disappear.\r\n\r\n=Starters in \"process\" butter and oleomargarine.= The advance which\r\nhas recently been made in the science and practice of cream ripening\r\nand butter production is utilized most effectively in the treatment\r\nof cream in the renovating process. Old, soured, and stale cream\r\nis reduced in acidity by the addition of lime. The cream is then\r\npasteurized and aerated to expel the odors as much as possible. A\r\nlarge amount of starter is then added and the cream immediately\r\nchurned. Under these conditions, the bad flavors are materially\r\nreduced in intensity, and desirable flavors absorbed by the fat from\r\nthe selected starter used. It is thus possible to produce butter of\r\ngood quality from cream that would at first be regarded as quite\r\nunsuitable for butter production.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of oleomargarine the same principle is utilized.\r\nThe butter aroma and flavor is imparted to the neutral oils and\r\ntasteless fats by mixing the same with a properly prepared starter.\r\nRenovated or process butter is given a desirable flavor in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\n=Wash water.= It has been found that the purity of the water used in\r\nwashing the granular butter has a marked influence on the keeping\r\nquality. If the water is from a shallow well into which surface\r\nwater finds its way, it is certain to contain large numbers of those\r\ntypes of bacteria that are found in the soil, while if it comes from\r\na deep well that is properly protected from surface contamination,\r\nthe bacterial content of the water will be low and no injurious\r\neffect on the butter will be noted. When it is impossible to obtain\r\npure water for washing purposes, a proper supply may be secured by\r\nsterilizing the water. The most convenient way of heating the water\r\nis by the direct injection of steam. It is necessary to use that\r\ncoming directly from the boilers and not the exhaust from the\r\nengine, since the latter is likely to contain small amounts of oil\r\nthat will impart to the butter an objectionable flavor. After\r\ncooling, the water is ready for use. It has been shown that the\r\ncost of treating an impure water is more than covered by the\r\nincreased returns from the product.\r\n\r\nA pure and healthful water supply should be one of the essential\r\nthings of every dairy, creamery, and cheese factory, not only for\r\nthe sake of the quality of the product, but also to avoid\r\ncontamination of products with disease-producing bacteria.\r\n\r\n=Bacteria in butter.= The germ content of butter will depend on the\r\ntype of cream. Sweet-cream butter contains but few bacteria. In\r\nsour-cream butter the content in bacteria will be greatly increased,\r\nespecially as to lactic organisms. Often, it may amount to several\r\nmillions of organisms per gram. The germ content of butter is said\r\nto be greater on the outside of a package than within the mass, due\r\ndoubtless to the free access of air, thus favoring the growth of the\r\naerobic forms.\r\n\r\nThe composition of normal butter does not favor the growth of the\r\nmajority of kinds of bacteria that are contained in it. The washing\r\nprocess removes much of the material suitable as food for the\r\nbacteria, such as sugar and albumen. If considerable butter milk is\r\nleft in the butter, the growth of bacteria will be quite rapid, at\r\nfirst, but does not continue for any considerable length of time.\r\nThe addition of salt also tends to restrain the growth of most kinds\r\nof bacteria.\r\n\r\nButter is at its best when it is perfectly fresh. Deterioration\r\nbegins within a short time and the rapidity with which the changes\r\ngo on is dependent on the temperature at which the butter is stored.\r\nThe temperature of the butter rooms in the large cold storage plants\r\nis kept below 0° F. The butter in such rooms will deteriorate very\r\nslowly, but on removal from the cold rooms and in storage at\r\nordinary temperatures deterioration goes on more rapidly than would\r\nhave been the case when the butter was fresh. At the temperature of\r\nan ordinary refrigerator the changes go on much more rapidly. This\r\nfact has often been looked on as indicating that the factors causing\r\nthe changes are biological ones. The influence of temperature in\r\naccelerating the changes would be the same if no biological factor\r\nwere active.\r\n\r\nThat biological factors are of importance is indicated by the fact\r\nthat the keeping quality of the product is profoundly affected by\r\nthe quality of the cream. Butter made from sweet, fresh cream, that\r\nhas been thoroughly pasteurized, has the best keeping quality, while\r\nbutter made from such cream, but not pasteurized, has the poorest\r\nkeeping quality, especially when no salt is added. Every process by\r\nwhich the desirable lactic bacteria are increased in proportion to\r\nother kinds has a marked effect in enhancing the keeping quality of\r\nthe butter. Thus, the use of pure cultures in raw cream, and\r\npasteurization together with the pure cultures, have a marked\r\nbeneficial effect.\r\n\r\nThe addition of preservatives exerts an effect on keeping quality.\r\nBorax is the chemical most frequently employed for this purpose. Its\r\nuse is allowed in Australia and New Zealand in butter that is\r\nshipped to England, but the use of all preservatives is forbidden in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe size of the package also has an effect on the keeping quality;\r\nthe smaller the package, the greater is the surface exposed to the\r\nair and the more rapidly the butter deteriorates. Butter used in the\r\nUnited States Navy is packed in hermetically sealed cans so as to\r\nexclude the air as far as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that any condition which restrains or inhibits the\r\ngrowth of micro-organisms has a tendency to improve the keeping\r\nquality of butter, it would appear that the detrimental changes in\r\nthe quality of butter are due to biological causes. The most common\r\ndefect known is that usually referred to as rancidity. There are,\r\nhowever, different types of changes that are probably included under\r\nthis head and it is very probable that different causes are\r\noperative in their production. True rancidity is probably due to\r\nbiological causes; the so-called tallowy change, in which the butter\r\nacquires the odor of tallow is probably due to the combined action\r\nof light and air on the fat.\r\n\r\n=Bacterial defects in butter.= There are a number of defects in butter\r\nthat are positively known to be due to the growth of bacteria in the\r\nmilk or cream, or in the butter itself. The lack of flavor is looked\r\nupon as a defect in the case of ripened-cream butter. It may be due\r\nto insufficient ripening of the cream, or to the lack of\r\nacid-forming bacteria that produce the desirable flavor-forming\r\ncompounds. Not all acid-forming bacteria are able to produce\r\nfavorable, flavor-giving compounds; hence, sour cream butter may\r\nsometimes be deficient in flavor by reason of this fact.\r\n\r\n=Putrid butter.= This specific butter trouble has been observed in\r\nDenmark, where it was first studied by Jensen. Butter affected by it\r\nrapidly acquires a peculiar putrid odor that ruins it for table use.\r\nSometimes this flavor may be developed in the cream previous to\r\nchurning. It may be caused by a number of bacteria.\r\n\r\n=Turnip flavored butter.= Butter sometimes acquires a flavor\r\nresembling turnips. This trouble may be due to the feeding of such\r\nroots, the aromatic substances peculiar to them being absorbed\r\ndirectly by the milk and thus transferred to the butter. Weigmann\r\ntraced a similar flavor to certain bacteria that entered the milk\r\nfrom barn filth.\r\n\r\n=Cowy odor in butter.= There is sometimes to be noted an odor in\r\nbutter as in milk that resembles that of the cow stable. Usually\r\nthis defect has been ascribed to the absorption of these odors\r\ndirectly by the milk. Organisms have also been described that impart\r\nto the butter a very similar odor. Bitter butter may be due to the\r\nfeed that is consumed by the cow, or it may be due to those forms of\r\nbacteria that produce a bitter fermentation of the milk.\r\n\r\n=Other abnormal flavors.= Among the numerous abnormal flavors that\r\nhave been noted in butter is one of quite frequent appearance, the\r\nso called \"fishy\" flavor. It is now believed by many that this\r\nflavor is due to the presence of small amounts of iron or copper\r\nsalts that have been introduced into the milk from utensils from\r\nwhich the protective coating of tin has been worn. If the milk or\r\ncream stored in such utensils develops any marked degree of acidity,\r\nthe acid will dissolve a small amount of the iron or copper. The\r\nfishy flavor has not been found in sweet-cream butter as would be\r\nexpected from the above explanation. In fresh butter a metallic\r\ntaste is sometimes present. It is believed by some that on storage\r\nthis flavor changes to the fishy flavor.\r\n\r\nAll utensils used for the storage of milk and cream should be kept\r\nin good condition so as to prevent the acid milk or cream from\r\ncoming in contact with iron or copper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Moldy Butter.\r\n\r\nThe mold grows on the paper in which the butter is wrapped rather\r\nthan on the butter. The print on the left was wrapped in the same\r\npaper as the print on the right except that the parchment cover had\r\nbeen steamed for a few moments.]\r\n\r\n=Moldy butter.= A defect that causes a great amount of loss is the\r\ndevelopment of mold on the surface of the butter, either in tubs\r\nor in prints. This trouble is easily prevented. Butter is not well\r\nsuited to the growth of mold, but the paper used for lining the\r\ntubs, or wrapping the prints is an excellent medium for mold growth.\r\nThe wood of the tub also furnishes ample food for this type of life,\r\nespecially where the wood contains any sap. One other essential\r\ncondition for mold growth is a supply of oxygen. The mold spores are\r\nwidely disseminated, and are always to be found on the butter tubs\r\nand on the paper. The number is not likely to be sufficient to cause\r\ntrouble unless the tubs and paper have been kept under such\r\nconditions, as to allow growth to take place on them before use.\r\nDuring damp, hot weather, the amount of moisture absorbed by these\r\nmaterials is often sufficient to allow molds to grow on them. This\r\ntrouble can be prevented by the storage of tubs and paper in a clean\r\ndry place, or by a disinfecting treatment which will destroy the\r\nmold spores. The most successful method of treatment of tubs is to\r\napply paraffin to the inner surface, which can be easily done by the\r\nuse of some one of the various machines now on the market. The\r\nthin layer of paraffin excludes the moisture from the wood, and also\r\nprevents the mold from obtaining a supply of oxygen for its growth.\r\nThe tubs may be steamed, treated with hot water, or filled with a\r\ndilute solution of formaldehyde, and allowed to stand overnight.\r\nSoaking in brine as is usually done in the creameries is of some\r\neffect, but will not completely kill mold spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Moldy Butter.\r\n\r\nThe butter was placed in a paraffined tub, but the paper was not\r\ntreated so as to destroy the mold spores thereon.]\r\n\r\nButter may mold where the tubs have been thoroughly treated, because\r\nof the mold spores on the paper used for the lining. One of the\r\nblack molds is able to thrive on parchment paper whenever the air is\r\ndamp. In the past but little attention has been paid to the paper as\r\na source of trouble. It is certain that it is often at fault, and\r\nthat as much attention should be paid to the paper as to the tub. A\r\nmost efficient way of treating paper, either for tub liners or print\r\nwrappers is to place same in boiling water for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA AND CHEESE MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nButter, such as that of the sweet-cream type that is highly esteemed\r\nin many parts of the world, may be made without the aid of bacteria,\r\nbut no important kind of cheese can be made under commercial\r\nconditions without them.\r\n\r\n=Types of cheese.= Cheese consists of the fat and the precipitated\r\ncasein of milk, together with a large amount of water and the salts\r\nfound in milk. The numerous types of cheese may be divided into two\r\ngroups, depending on the manner in which the curdling of the milk is\r\nbrought about. Sour-milk cheese is made from curd, formed as a\r\nresult of the acid fermentation of the milk. Thus, at the very first\r\nstage in the making of this type, the importance of bacteria is\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThe second type is that made from curd, which is precipitated by the\r\naddition of rennet to the milk. This type may also be divided into\r\ntwo groups, depending upon their texture; the hard cheese, and the\r\nsoft cheese. The ordinary cheddar, the common American type, is the\r\nmost important example of the hard cheese; Limburger, of the soft\r\ncheese. Cheese are designated as hard or soft, depending upon the\r\namount of whey that is retained in them during the making process.\r\nThe moisture content has an important influence on the type and\r\namount of life that develops on and in the curd mass, and as will be\r\nseen, the ripening and flavor of the cheese are dependent upon these\r\nbiological factors.\r\n\r\nThe two groups of hard and soft cheese have no sharply defined\r\nlimits, but merge into each other. The extreme types of the hard\r\ncheese are so dry and firm that they can be cut only with\r\ndifficulty. Such cheese are used primarily as condiments to impart a\r\nflavor to certain dishes, as macaroni, and for this purpose are\r\ngrated. The extreme type of soft cheese is a soft, pasty mass and\r\ncan be easily spread with a knife.\r\n\r\nHard cheese, because the ripening process goes on uniformly\r\nthroughout the entire mass of cheese, may be made of any size which\r\npermits of commercial handling. They can also be kept for long\r\nperiods and preserve their good qualities. Soft cheese are made in\r\nsmall sizes, since on account of their consistency, they could not\r\notherwise be handled, and also because of the manner of ripening.\r\nThe ripening is due to the action of organisms developing on the\r\nsurface, the by-products of which diffuse into the curd. If the\r\ncheese are too large, the outer layers become overripe, while the\r\ninterior remains more or less unchanged, or insufficiently changed.\r\nSoft cheese mature much more rapidly than hard cheese; consequently\r\nthey are short lived.\r\n\r\nAlthough made from the same substance, milk, it is noteworthy that\r\nthere are over four hundred varieties of cheese produced. Most of\r\nthese find only a local market where made. Less than a dozen\r\nvarieties are to be regarded as general articles of commerce.\r\n\r\n=Quality of milk.= In the making of butter there are a number of\r\nprocesses that the maker can use when he finds himself obliged to\r\nutilize poor milk. The milk can be pasteurized and the harmful\r\nbacteria thus destroyed; desirable kinds can then be added in the\r\nform of a pure-culture starter. Pasteurization also drives off some\r\nof the volatile by-products of the first acid fermentation. By the\r\nuse of these means, the maker can prepare a very good product from\r\npoor material.\r\n\r\nIn the making of most kinds of cheese, especially those of the\r\ngreatest commercial importance, the cheese maker can call to his\r\nhelp no such aids, but must use the milk as it is brought to him. It\r\nis possible to prepare certain kinds of soft cheese from pasteurized\r\nmilk that differ in no essential point from the same cheese made\r\nfrom raw milk. Hard cheese are also made from pasteurized milk, but\r\nin most cases such cheese differ, especially in the degree of\r\nflavor, from that made from unheated milk. It is quite probable\r\nthat, as the factors concerned in the ripening of cheese become\r\nbetter known, methods will be evolved for the successful production\r\nof many kinds of cheese from pasteurized milk.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the quality of milk is almost wholly\r\ndependent upon the number and kinds of bacteria it contains. These\r\nbacteria pass into the cheese, and there produce the same products\r\nas they would have done in the milk itself. In butter making,\r\npractically all processes are under the control of the maker, until\r\nthe product is ready for the market; but cheese, on the other hand,\r\npasses through a complicated series of changes after it has left the\r\nmaker's control. During the manipulation of the milk and the curd in\r\nthe vat, he can exert some influence on the quality of the product,\r\nbut he is much more dependent on the quality of the milk than is the\r\ncase in butter making.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should therefore be made to furnish to the cheese maker\r\nthe quality of milk from which he can prepare fine cheese. In other\r\nwords, the milk should be produced under clean conditions and\r\ncarefully cooled and handled until delivered to the maker. Poor milk\r\nfrom a single farm may have such an effect upon the cheese made from\r\nthe milk of twenty farms as to depreciate the selling value of the\r\nentire product several cents per pound.\r\n\r\nThe tests that have been previously described (p. 105) have been\r\ndevised especially for testing the quality of the milk for cheese\r\nmaking purposes, and are of the greatest service to the maker in\r\ntracing the source of poor milk.\r\n\r\n=Cheddar cheese.= The first step in the making of cheddar cheese is\r\nthe \"ripening\" of the milk, or the development of a small amount of\r\nacid. In this fermentation, the development of acid is preceded by\r\nan enormous increase in the number of acid-forming bacteria. Milk\r\nfor cheese making should show an acidity of about 0.2 per cent or\r\nslightly more than in fresh milk. In other words, the maker wishes\r\nthe milk to be in such condition, bacteriologically, that if kept at\r\na temperature favorable for the growth of the acid-forming bacteria,\r\nthe acidity will increase rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe curdling of the milk to precipitate the cheese solids is\r\nproduced by the addition of rennet, which is obtained by extracting\r\nthe fourth stomach of the young calf with a solution of common salt.\r\nIn the past the maker prepared his own rennet solution from the\r\ndried stomachs (\"rennets\"), but at present, the extract is prepared\r\ncommercially, in a much more uniform manner. The rapidity of the\r\ncurdling is dependent upon the acidity of the milk. In order to\r\nsecure proper rennet action, a slight increase of acid over that\r\nfound in fresh milk is usually necessary; thus at the very beginning\r\nof the process of making cheddar cheese, the bacteria are of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nAs the milk curdles, the bacteria are enclosed in the curd as are\r\nthe fat globules. The curd is cut into small fragments by means of\r\na curd knife, and as the mass is warmed, the acid develops, causing\r\nthe curd particles to shrink, thus expressing the whey. Within a\r\nshort time, the volume of the curd is not more than one-eighth that\r\nof the milk, but in the curd are held over 75 per cent of the\r\nbacteria of the milk. To secure rapid curdling in the vat, the milk\r\nis warmed to 85° to 90° F., a temperature that is most favorable for\r\nthe growth of the lactic bacteria. Since there is a large number of\r\nbacteria concentrated in a small volume, and the temperature, as\r\nwell as all other conditions, is favorable to growth, multiplication\r\nof the bacteria goes on rapidly, and as a consequence, acid is\r\nformed in large amounts, as is shown by the following figures given\r\nby Publow for the manufacture of the export type of cheddar cheese:\r\n\r\n  Acidity of milk before adding rennet               .2  to .21 per cent\r\n  Acidity of whey before heating curd                .14 to .145    \"\r\n  Acidity of whey before removing from curd          .16 to .18     \"\r\n  Acidity of whey coming from the curd after\r\n    removal of whey and curd is packed               .24 to .30     \"\r\n  Acidity of whey coming from curd before milling    .65 to .75     \"\r\n  Acidity of whey coming from curd before salting    .90 to 1.10    \"\r\n\r\nIf the milk had been kept at the same temperature as the curd, the\r\nacidity would have increased much more slowly since the acid would\r\nhave been distributed through a larger volume. In the cheese curd\r\nthe same amount of acid is probably formed, as would have been\r\nproduced in the total amount of milk during the same interval.\r\n\r\nThe acid produced by this bacterial activity has a most marked\r\neffect on the curd. At first the curd masses are tough and firm,\r\nthe particles showing no tendency to adhere to each other. As the\r\nacid increases in amount, the curd becomes plastic, the outer\r\nsurface of the particles adhering or \"matting,\" as the maker\r\nexpresses it. The result is a solid coalescent mass of curd, which\r\nis cut into small pieces, _i.e._, \"milled,\" before it is put to\r\npress. The acid allows the blending of the pieces under the\r\ninfluence of the pressure so that a cheese is one single mass. Under\r\ncertain abnormal conditions, the development of acid may be\r\ninterfered with and the particles of curd fail to mat, in which\r\ncase, the cheese will be crumbly when it is cut. The determination\r\nof the proper time for pressing is made by the application of what\r\nis known as the hot iron test. This is made by determining the\r\nlength of the \"strings\" or \"threads\" which can be drawn from a mass\r\nof curd when it is brought in contact with a hot iron at a cherry\r\nred heat, the length of the curd threads being a measure of the\r\namount of acid that has been formed in the curd.\r\n\r\nThe rate of acid formation within the curd particles is also\r\nmeasured by determining the acidity of the whey as it comes from the\r\ncurd at different stages in the making. This test, which is often\r\nused in place of the \"hot iron\" test is carried out in the same\r\nmanner, as in determining the acidity of milk or cream. The quality\r\nof the cheese, both as to texture and flavor, is dependent to a\r\ngreat degree upon the amount of acid that is formed during the\r\nvarious stages in making; hence, the successful maker must follow\r\nclosely by some means the acid formation in the curd until it is put\r\nto press.\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary that the milk shall contain a sufficient number\r\nof acid-forming bacteria to produce the required amount of acid. If\r\na sufficient number of bacteria are not present in the milk as it is\r\nreceived, as is the case with very sweet milk, they must be added\r\nby the maker in the form of a starter, or the process of making will\r\nbe much prolonged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Bacteria in Cheese.\r\n\r\nA photomicrograph of curd just after curdling has taken place. Note\r\nthe few lactic acid bacteria embedded in the curd.]\r\n\r\n=Starters in cheese making.= The starters used in cheese making, are\r\nidentical with those employed in butter making and the same\r\nprecautions should be observed in their propagation. It is important\r\nthat the starters should not be such as to form a hard curd that\r\ncannot be mixed uniformly with the milk, since the curd particles\r\nwould appear as white specks in the cheese. The starter should be\r\nadded to the milk through a hair sieve, and well mixed with the\r\nmilk, so as to distribute the bacteria uniformly. Amounts varying\r\nfrom 0.5 to 2 per cent are used. In butter making, it is essential\r\nthat the bacteria of the starter be able to form not only acid, but\r\nsufficient flavor-forming substances to impart to the butter a\r\ndesirable flavor. In cheese making it is not probable that this\r\nlatter characteristic is of any particular importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Bacteria in Cheese.\r\n\r\nA photomicrograph of curd at the time the salt is added. The lactic\r\nacid bacteria have increased materially in numbers.]\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that the process of cheese making shall conform as\r\nclosely as possible to that which experience has shown to give the\r\nbest results. The rate at which acid is developed in the curd and\r\nthe rapidity with which the whey is expelled therefrom should bear a\r\ncertain ratio to each other. If the milk has too high a degree of\r\nacidity, _i.e._, is overripe, the acidity developed in the curd will\r\nbe too high before the curd is sufficiently firm; with a very sweet\r\nmilk, the reverse may be true. It is desirable for the cheesemaker\r\nto obtain as good an idea as possible of the condition of the milk\r\nwith reference to its bacterial content, since this will determine\r\nthe rate at which acid will be formed in the curd. If the milk is\r\ntoo sweet, _i.e._, too low in acid-forming bacteria, a starter\r\nshould be added. The only methods by which this information can be\r\nobtained by the maker is by determining the acidity by the usual\r\nmethod or better by the use of the rennet test by which is\r\nascertained the time required for a given amount of rennet to curdle\r\na definite quantity of milk at a standard temperature. The varying\r\nfactor in the test will be the acidity of the milk. Very slight\r\ndifferences influence profoundly the time of curdling. If, working\r\nunder standard conditions, it is found that the time of curdling of\r\none sample is 10 seconds and of another sample, 20 seconds, it is\r\nproof that the acidity of the first is higher than that of the\r\nsecond, that its bacterial content is greater and that acidity will\r\ndevelop in the curd more rapidly. The first may need a small amount\r\nof starter, the second a larger quantity. Working with milk from the\r\nsame source, the maker, from his experience, will know how much\r\nstarter should be added to milk that has given a certain result with\r\nthe rennet test in order that the acid shall be developed in the\r\ncurd at a desired rate.\r\n\r\n=Ripening of cheese.= The curd at the time it is put to press is tough\r\nand rubbery, and has none of the characteristic flavor of cheddar\r\ncheese; it is also quite insoluble and indigestible. Before the\r\ncheese is fit to eat it must pass through a complex series of\r\nchanges which are collectively known as _ripening_. In these changes\r\nthere is not only a breaking down of the casein into soluble\r\ncompounds, which process makes the cheese soft and plastic under\r\npressure, but the characteristic flavor is developed in greater or\r\nless degree. A very considerable part of the cheese thus becomes\r\nsoluble in water, and it is much more easily digested than in an\r\nunripened condition.\r\n\r\nThe different factors that are operative in the ripening changes are\r\nnot yet fully known, but in recent years as a result of scientific\r\nstudy, material progress in the study of the changes has been made.\r\n\r\n=Rennet.= The commercial rennet extract when in condition for use\r\ncontains very few bacteria. A preservative, boric acid, is added by\r\nthe manufacturer to restrain the bacteria, otherwise the extract\r\nwould soon be unfit for use. The bacteria in the commercial rennet\r\nextract are too few to be of any importance whatever in the ripening\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nRennet extract contains an enzyme, rennin, that causes the milk to\r\ncurdle; also another enzyme, pepsin, that exerts a digestive action\r\non the curdled casein. Pepsin is always found in the stomach juices\r\nof all animals, but no digestive action takes place, unless the\r\nreaction is distinctly acid, as is the ease under normal conditions,\r\nsince hydrochloric acid is excreted by the walls of the stomach.\r\nOutside of the stomach, the same conditions must obtain with\r\nreference to the presence of acid, if pepsin is to exert a digestive\r\neffect. In the cheese curd, the milk sugar is rapidly changed into\r\nlactic acid by the action of the bacteria. This gives the proper\r\nchemical reaction for peptic action, and the enzyme is then able to\r\nact on the paracasein, the nitrogenous part of the cheese. If milk\r\ncontains no acid-forming bacteria, conditions will not permit of\r\npeptic action, and as a consequence, the ripening processes do not\r\ntake place. If the sugar is fermented by some organism that does\r\nnot form acid, as the lactose-fermenting yeasts, the cheese does not\r\nripen. The lactic bacteria are therefore an essential factor in\r\ninaugurating the ripening changes in all types of rennet cheese.\r\n\r\n=Preservative action of acid.= In a previous chapter it was shown that\r\nraw milk does not undergo putrefaction because of the restraining\r\neffect of the acid formed by the lactic bacteria on the putrefactive\r\norganisms. This same phenomenon is noted in cheese. Milk always\r\ncontains putrefactive bacteria which pass into the cheese, but they\r\ncannot grow therein because of the high acidity. In the absence of\r\nthe acid-forming organisms in the cheese, the cheese may remain\r\ntough and rubbery, on account of the lack of suitable conditions for\r\nthe action of the pepsin of the rennet extract, or when the milk\r\ncontains large numbers of digesting organisms, the cheese may\r\ndevelop a putrefactive condition, as noted by the offensive odor and\r\nsoft pasty texture.\r\n\r\n=Other factors concerned in cheese ripening.= There are other factors\r\nthat are also concerned in the complex series of ripening changes\r\nnoted in cheddar cheese. All animal fluids and tissues, if kept\r\nunder perfectly sterile conditions at ordinary temperatures, will\r\nundergo a certain amount of decomposition, due apparently to their\r\ncontent in enzymes that have a digestive action. Meat kept in\r\nstorage becomes more tender due to the softening of the connective\r\ntissue. Milk, derived as it is from actively secreting cell tissue,\r\ngives certain reactions that are common to living material. If\r\nchloroform, which restrains the action of bacteria, but does not\r\nprevent the activity of enzymes, is added to it, it will curdle in\r\nthe course of a few weeks and will become partially digested. This\r\ndigesting ferment found in milk is known as _galactase_. Compounds\r\nare formed in milk thus preserved that are similar to those found in\r\na ripe cheddar cheese. Many experiments have been made with\r\npasteurized milk, but it has not been possible to produce typical,\r\nnormal cheese from thoroughly pasteurized milk. Such cheese are\r\nmarkedly deficient in the typical flavor of cheddar cheese. From\r\nthis fact it is believed that the inherent enzymes of milk are a\r\nfactor of some importance in the ripening of this type of cheese at\r\nleast, if not of all types.\r\n\r\nIn the past, other factors have been thought to be of importance.\r\nDuclaux, a French bacteriologist, considered that the enzymes formed\r\nby the digesting bacteria are responsible for the ripening. It is\r\nnow known that they can have but little if any part in the process,\r\nsince they are not present in all cheese in sufficient numbers to\r\nhave any marked effect, and since the acidity of the cheese mass\r\nwill not permit of their development.\r\n\r\nOther types of bacteria have been considered by bacteriologists to\r\nbe of importance in the ripening process, but it is certain that the\r\npurely digestive change in the mass of the cheese can be accounted\r\nfor through the action of the factors already noted.\r\n\r\n=Flavor production.= The flavor of any type of cheese is the most\r\nimportant characteristic, just as it is in butter, for it is largely\r\nthe flavor that determines the selling value of the product, and is\r\nthe most difficult thing to control. It has been thought that the\r\nflavor-producing substances were derived from the paracasein of the\r\ncurd and were produced by the factors that are concerned in the\r\ndigestion of the paracasein. It has been shown that a cheese may be\r\nthoroughly ripened as far as its physical properties are concerned;\r\nthat it may contain the end products of casein digestion, and yet\r\nbe low in flavor. From recent researches it seems probable that the\r\nproduction of flavor is connected with the change that the sugar\r\nundergoes in the acid fermentation, as volatile acids, acetic,\r\nformic, etc., as well as alcohols and esters are formed in\r\nincreasing amounts as the ripening progresses. These may have come\r\nfrom the decomposition of the milk sugar, or from a secondary change\r\nin the products of the lactic fermentation. There are organisms in\r\nboth milk and cheese that do not grow on the ordinary culture media\r\nused by the bacteriologist, and it may well be that some of these\r\nare of importance in flavor production. Their destruction in\r\npasteurization is likely to be one of the reasons for the failure of\r\ncheese made from pasteurized milk to develop typical flavor.\r\n\r\n=Effect of temperature on ripening.= The temperature at which the\r\nripening cheese is kept has been found to be of the greatest\r\nimportance in determining the quality of the product. If the cheese\r\nis kept at high temperatures, the ripening proceeds rapidly; the\r\ncheese is short lived, and has a sharp, strong flavor, and generally\r\na more or less open texture. Unless the cheese is made from the best\r\nquality of milk, it is likely to undergo undesirable fermentations\r\nwhen ripened at high temperatures.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years it has been found possible to ripen cheese at\r\ntemperatures that were previously thought to be certain to spoil the\r\nproduct. Much of the cheese is now ripened at temperatures below 50°\r\nF. The ripening goes on more slowly than at higher temperatures, but\r\nthe flavor of the cheese is clean and entirely devoid of the sharp\r\nundesirable tang that is so frequently noted in old cheese, and the\r\ntexture is solid and meaty. Ripening at low temperatures, when the\r\nmilk is not of the best quality, is certain to result in a much\r\nbetter product than when higher temperatures are employed.\r\n\r\n=Abnormal fermentations in cheese.= As has been previously shown, it\r\nis necessary to have an abundant supply of acid-forming bacteria in\r\nthe milk from which cheese is to be made. If these bacteria are\r\nsupplanted by other kinds, the product will be more or less abnormal\r\neither in texture or in flavor, or possibly in both. Many of these\r\nabnormal fermentations have been studied and the organisms concerned\r\nin the changes found.\r\n\r\nIf the milk is handled carelessly, it will contain many bacteria\r\nable to form acid and gas. As noted previously, these organisms form\r\nproducts in milk that have an offensive odor and a disagreeable\r\ntaste. In cheese the gases cause the formation of holes, more or\r\nless numerous, depending on the number of the gas-forming bacteria\r\nin the milk. Where these bacteria are abundant, gas may appear while\r\nthe curd is in the vat, causing it to float in the whey, when it is\r\nknown as a \"floater.\" Again, the gas may not become evident until\r\nthe cheese is in the press or on the curing shelf, when it becomes\r\napparent by the swelling or bulging of the cheese. Such cheese is\r\ntermed \"huffed\" or \"swelled.\" The internal pressure may be so great\r\nas to cause the cheese to crack and to force out some of the curd.\r\nThe presence of gas holes is indicative of a poor cheese, because\r\nthe formation of gas is always accompanied by the presence of other\r\nundesirable compounds.\r\n\r\nPure culture starters are often used to overcome gassy\r\nfermentations. In cheese a certain amount of acid can be produced by\r\nthe acid-forming bacteria. When the pure lactic bacteria alone are\r\npresent, the cheese is very likely to be of good quality. If the\r\nsugar is fermented by gas-forming organisms, the curd will be full\r\nof holes and the flavor poor, while if the sugar is fermented by a\r\nmixture of the desirable and undesirable bacteria, the quality of\r\nthe product will depend on the relation of the two types. If through\r\nthe addition of a pure-culture starter, the proportion of desirable\r\nbacteria is increased, the gas will be lessened in amount and the\r\ncheese improved. It was formerly supposed that the lactic bacteria\r\nhad an injurious effect on the gas-forming organisms. There is no\r\ngood reason to believe that this is the case, but that both grow in\r\nthe milk and cheese, but since only a certain amount of acid can be\r\nproduced, it is important to have as much of it formed by the lactic\r\nbacteria as possible, since the amount of injurious products in the\r\ncheese will thus be limited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Gassy Cheese.\r\n\r\nSuch a cheese is worthless on account of its poor flavor. The\r\nirregular holes are mechanical. The crack on the upper side is due\r\nto the pressure of the gas which has caused the cheese to bulge at\r\nthis point.]\r\n\r\nThe gas formed in the curd before the cheese is put to press can be\r\ngotten rid of by proper manipulation of the curd. While this\r\ntreatment may improve the appearance of the cheese, it does not\r\neliminate the substances that impart to the cheese undesirable\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nGassy curds have also been treated by washing the curd with cold\r\nwater. Care must be taken in applying this method for the removal of\r\ntoo much of the sugar and acid from the curd by the washing will\r\npermit the growth of injurious forms of bacteria. The addition of\r\nsalt or of saltpeter has also been made to the milk in order to\r\novercome gassy conditions in the milk. In the handling of gassy\r\nmilk, the usual practice has been to develop a larger amount of acid\r\nbefore drawing the whey than in the case of good milk. This was done\r\nwith the idea that acid suppressed gas formation. It has been shown\r\npreviously that this is not the case. It has also been shown by\r\nDoane that the development of too much acid before drawing the whey\r\nis likely to result in undesirable flavors, producing what is known\r\nas \"high-acid\" or \"sour\" cheese.\r\n\r\nThe gas-forming bacteria grow best at high temperatures; hence,\r\ncheese kept under these conditions are more likely to be affected by\r\nthis trouble than are those kept at lower temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe most successful method of preventing trouble with gassy milk in\r\ncheese making is to eliminate undesirable milk by frequent testing\r\nof the supply of the different patrons by means of the Wisconsin\r\ncurd test.\r\n\r\nNot only gas-forming bacteria may be the cause of gassy cheese, but\r\nthe lactose-fermenting yeasts may cause similar trouble. If these\r\nare abundant in the milk, a considerable part of the sugar may be\r\nfermented by them, in which case, carbon dioxide gas is abundantly\r\nformed. The cheese thus rendered gassy will present the same\r\nappearance to the eye as where the gas is formed by bacteria, but\r\nwill have a different flavor. The odor of alcohol may be evident,\r\nand if most of the sugar has been fermented by the yeast, the\r\nacidity of the cheese may not be sufficient for the pepsin to exert\r\nits digestive action.\r\n\r\nMilk containing many gas-forming bacteria occurs most frequently in\r\nsummer. It is claimed by some that the milk of cattle pastured on\r\nlow lands is more likely to contain the gas-forming organisms than\r\nthat from cattle running on higher lands. If this is true, it must\r\nbe due to the bacterial content of the soil; the udders of the\r\nanimals become soiled as they lie on the ground, and during the\r\nmilking, the dust finds its way into the pail. Many cheese makers\r\nthink that the milk from an animal suffering from a garget may be\r\nthe cause of the huffing of cheese. This belief is undoubtedly well\r\nfounded, as some of the bacteria known to be the cause of garget are\r\ngas-forming.\r\n\r\n=Bitter cheese.= In a previous chapter the bitter fermentation of milk\r\nhas been discussed. If milk containing large numbers of such\r\norganisms is made into cheese, the bitterness is very likely to be\r\nnoted in it. Cheese made from milk containing few or no lactic\r\nbacteria is likely to develop a bitter taste, due to the growth of\r\nthe digestive bacteria that are able to grow through the lack of\r\nacid in the cheese.\r\n\r\nIf the milk contains considerable numbers of yeasts, a sweet or\r\nfruity flavor is apt to develop, due to the products of the\r\nfermentation of the sugar by the yeast. This flavor resembles that\r\nof fermented fruit, or the bouquet of certain kinds of wine.\r\n\r\n=Putrid cheese.= In the absence of acid-forming bacteria, the cheese\r\nmay develop a putrid or rotten odor, due to the growth of some types\r\nof putrefactive or digesting bacteria. This trouble is very\r\ninfrequent in cheddar cheese, since this is made from ripened milk,\r\nbut occurs more frequently in those types in which no acid is\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nBacteria develop in the cheese in colonies or masses, just as they\r\ndo in the plate cultures of the bacteriologist, made with\r\ntransparent media, such as gelatin. Cheese is opaque; therefore, the\r\ngrowing colonies cannot be readily discovered, but when\r\npigment-forming bacteria grow in the cheese, their presence is\r\nlikely to be noted, because of the colored spots that are formed.\r\n\r\n=Rusty spot.= The \"rusty spot\" that has been encountered in New York\r\nand Canada is due to one of the colored bacteria which produces an\r\norange or yellowish-red pigment. Various other pigment-forming\r\norganisms have been met in cheese, each producing its colored colony\r\nwhich differentiates itself from the mass of the cheese. If the\r\npigment is produced in considerable quantities, and is soluble in\r\nany of the constituents of the cheese, the color will not appear in\r\nspots but will be more diffuse, or may impart a color to the entire\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nCases of acute poisoning arising from the ingestion of cheese are\r\nnot infrequently reported; similar instances result from the use of\r\nice cream. In both cases it is believed that poisonous products have\r\nbeen formed by bacteria, probably by some of the putrefactive forms.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said with reference to the abnormal fermentations\r\nof cheese, it will be seen that they are always due to the lack of\r\nacid-forming bacteria, or to their partial replacement by other\r\ntypes. In order to prevent such troubles, it is necessary to insure\r\nthat the milk has been produced under clean conditions, from healthy\r\ncows, and has been handled in such a manner as to reach the maker in\r\nas sweet and fresh condition as possible. The maker can, by the use\r\nof proper starters, control the kinds of bacteria essential for the\r\nripening process. A well trained maker should be able to prepare\r\nfrom such milk a uniform product of the highest quality. The effort\r\nof cheese makers at the present time is to handle milk of more or\r\nless objectionable quality so as to secure from it as good cheese as\r\nis possible. But cheese is so sensitive as to character of milk used\r\nthat greater effort should be spent in securing an improved supply.\r\n\r\n=Moldy cheese.= In the case of the cheddar cheese and other types of\r\nhard cheese, it is essential that their surfaces be kept clean, and\r\nnot discolored by the growth of molds, which find favorable\r\nconditions for growth on the surface of the cheese in the moist\r\natmosphere of the curing room. The molding of cheddar cheese can be\r\nprevented by covering the cheese with a layer of paraffin which\r\nstops the development of the mold spores, by shutting off the\r\nnecessary supply of oxygen. For this purpose the cheese are dipped\r\nin melted paraffin when a few days old.\r\n\r\nIn the case of types of cheese which are salted by applying the salt\r\nto the surface, or with soft cheese which ripen from the outside,\r\nother methods of mold prevention are employed, such as rubbing and\r\nwashing the cheese. The curing room itself may be freed from the\r\nmold spores by the use of such standard disinfectants as formalin or\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\n=Swiss cheese.= One of the most important kinds of hard cheese, is the\r\nSwiss or Emmenthaler, so named, from the country and valley in which\r\nthe cheese was first made. In America, this type was introduced by\r\nSwiss immigrants, and is being made in constantly increasing\r\nquantities in Ohio and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nSwiss cheese is a hard firm type, appearing in the markets in the\r\nform of the flat circular \"drum\" cheese, two to three feet in\r\ndiameter, and six to eight inches thick, or in the smaller \"block\"\r\nform. In this country the cheese is prepared twice a day, since it\r\nis necessary to work up the milk while it is perfectly sweet.\r\nIndeed, the milk is received at the factories while it is still\r\nwarm, and within five or six hours after it is drawn from the cow\r\nthe cheese is on the press. If the attempt is made to prepare Swiss\r\ncheese from the kind of milk that is best suited for cheddar\r\npurposes, _i.e._, milk in which the acidity has increased to some\r\nextent, the flavor of the resulting product is likely to approximate\r\na cheddar cheese rather than that of a Swiss.\r\n\r\nIn the salting process, the salt is not mixed with the curd before\r\nit is pressed, but is applied by immersing the cheese for a few days\r\nin a saturated brine, and then rubbing salt over the surface of the\r\ncheese. In this way the salt gradually diffuses quite uniformly\r\nthrough the cheese. The method of salting has apparently a marked\r\ninfluence on the ripening process, since if the salt is added in the\r\nsame way, and in amounts used in the cheddar process, the flavor\r\nwill not be that of a Swiss cheese but will resemble a cheddar.\r\n\r\nIn cheddar cheese, the whey is expelled from the curd by means of\r\nthe acid which is developed in the curd, and by heating the curd to\r\na temperature of 95° F. to 100° F. In Swiss cheese the development\r\nof acid during the making process is prevented, because of the\r\nsmaller number of acid-forming bacteria in the milk; other factors\r\nmust therefore contribute to the expulsion of the whey to secure a\r\nfirm curd. This is accomplished by cutting the curd into very small\r\npieces and by briskly stirring it during the making, heating it\r\nduring this process for a period of 20 to 30 minutes at 130° to 140°\r\nF. It might be thought that this high temperature, which is\r\napproximately that used in pasteurization would destroy the\r\nacid-forming bacteria, but these are apparently protected as they\r\nare within the curd. During the time the cheese is being pressed,\r\nthe contained bacteria begin to grow and the whey coming from the\r\ncheese toward the end of the pressing shows a high acidity. If it\r\ndoes not show such a development of acid, the maker has reason to\r\nbelieve that the cheese may never ripen in a typical manner.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that the milk contains but few acid-forming\r\nbacteria. The maker, however, attempts to insure the presence of a\r\nsufficient number by the use of \"home-made\" rennet. This is prepared\r\nby placing a piece of dried rennet, _i.e._, the stomach of the calf,\r\nin whey, keeping the same in a warm place for twenty-four to\r\nthirty-six hours. As the rennet contains acid-forming organisms,\r\nthese grow rapidly in the warm whey, so that by adding this sour\r\nwhey to the milk, the maker is not only adding rennet, that is to\r\ncurdle the milk, but also a small starter of lactic bacteria. If the\r\nrennet thus prepared contains no harmful bacteria and the milk is of\r\ngood quality, the cheese is likely to ripen in a normal manner. The\r\nrennet should be prepared with due regard to bacteriological\r\nprinciples, a condition that is rarely met in Swiss factories in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nSwiss cheese has two striking characteristics, the flavor and the\r\npresence of holes or \"eyes.\" The flavor is sweetish rather than the\r\nsharp and pungent flavor of cheddar cheese. The bacteria concerned\r\nin its production are not known, but it is certain that specific\r\norganisms play some role, since if the flora of the cheese is\r\nchanged by salting the curd or by the use of milk containing large\r\nnumbers of lactic bacteria, the flavor will also be changed. This\r\nrole of the acid-forming bacteria in Swiss is the same as in\r\ncheddar, _i.e._, through the acid, conditions are established for\r\npeptic action, the curd being partially digested while at the same\r\ntime the curd mass is protected from putrefactive processes.\r\n\r\nIn Swiss cheese during the ripening process, holes about the size of\r\na large cherry develop which should be quite uniformly distributed\r\nthroughout the cheese. The inner surface of the hole is glistening\r\nand, in a well-ripened cheese, a small quantity of clear brine,\r\n_i.e._, \"tears\" may be noted. These holes or \"eyes\" may be called\r\nthe trade mark of the Swiss cheese, since without them the product\r\nhas a lessened commercial value, even if it possesses the typical\r\nflavor. The \"eyes\" are caused by bacteria that ferment the lactic\r\nacid produced by the lactic bacteria, forming from it propionic\r\nacid and carbon dioxide, the latter gas being the cause of the hole\r\nor \"eye.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Swiss Cheese.\r\n\r\nNormal development of \"eyes\" in a Swiss cheese. The eyes are\r\ngenerally as large as a cherry.]\r\n\r\nThe \"eye\"-forming organisms cannot grow in the presence of any\r\namount of salt, hence, if salt is added directly to the curd, the\r\ncheese is likely to be \"blind\" or free from holes. The eyes are\r\nformed not at the time gas holes are produced in a cheddar cheese,\r\n_i.e._, early in the ripening process, but after a lapse of three or\r\nfour weeks. They are most abundant in the middle of the cheese since\r\nthe manner of salting is such as to inhibit their formation near the\r\nsurface. The eye-forming bacteria may have some effect on the flavor\r\nof the cheese.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss maker encounters the same troubles as does the cheddar\r\nmaker. Gassy cheese is more prevalent in the Swiss than in the\r\ncheddar industry, since the maker cannot call to his aid the methods\r\nused by the cheddar maker, viz., the addition of a heavy starter,\r\nthe washing of the curd, etc. It is especially important that the\r\nquality of the milk be first class in every respect, and yet\r\ncustoms prevail in the Swiss industry that are directly inimical to\r\nthe production of good milk. The grossest carelessness prevails at\r\nthe factories in the matter of handling the whey. It is often kept\r\nin individual barrels for each patron. (See Fig. 8.) These are not\r\nkept thoroughly clean and the result is that the whey taken back to\r\nthe farm in the cans that are used to bring the fresh milk is often\r\nin an advanced stage of fermentation.\r\n\r\nThere are many other kinds of hard cheese; but in each, so far as is\r\nknown, the role of the acid-forming bacteria is identical with that\r\nnoted in cheddar and Swiss cheese, viz, in preparing conditions\r\nfavorable for peptic action, and preventing the development of\r\nputrefactive bacteria present in the curd.\r\n\r\n=Roquefort cheese.= Among the more important foreign types of cheese\r\nthat are characterized by the development of mold is Roquefort, so\r\nnamed from the district in France in which it is made. This cheese\r\nis made from sheep's milk, in much the same manner as cheddar. The\r\ncharacteristic process in its preparation is the inoculation of the\r\ncurd, at the time it is put to press, with the spores of a\r\nparticular kind of mold, a type closely related to the ordinary\r\ngreen mold of bread and cheese. The mold for inoculation is grown on\r\nbread, the whole mass being dried so that it can be powdered; then\r\nthe ground-up material is sprinkled on the curd as it is placed in\r\nthe press hoops. The first stage in the ripening of Roquefort is\r\nprobably identical with that of the types of hard cheeses already\r\nconsidered, the breaking-down of the curd being due to the pepsin of\r\nthe rennet used, which action is made possible by the acid formed by\r\nthe bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe second stage in ripening, and one in which the characteristic\r\nflavor of the cheese is developed, is due to the growth of the mold\r\nwith which the cheese is seeded. Molds can grow only in the presence\r\nof air, and in order to provide this condition, the cheese are run\r\nthrough a machine having a series of needle-like projections which\r\nfills the cheese with fine holes. This allows the air to penetrate\r\nthe cheese and the mold to grow, the fruiting of which develops the\r\ncharacteristic flavor. The changes produced by the mold are not well\r\nunderstood, but the flavor is evidently connected with its\r\ndevelopment since in the absence of mold, it does not appear. The\r\ncheese must be cured under carefully controlled conditions, as to\r\ntemperature and moisture; in France these are secured by curing the\r\ncheese in limestone caves that are highly saturated with moisture.\r\nAttempts have been made to make Roquefort cheese in other parts of\r\nthe world, but they have never been successful, due undoubtedly to\r\nthe fact that the proper environment and conditions for the\r\ndevelopment of the various types of organisms necessary in the\r\nripening process have not been met. This cheese is sold for 50 to 75\r\ncents per pound in the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nThere are two other kinds of cheese that are closely related to\r\nRoquefort, as to the manner of ripening, viz., the Gorgonzola of\r\nItaly and the Stilton of England, both of which possess their\r\ncharacteristic flavors by reason of the development of molds. In\r\nStilton cheese the mold is not intentionally added, the maker\r\nrelying on the contamination that comes from the factory for the\r\nusual seeding. If this does not develop, it is sometimes inoculated\r\nby exchanging plugs with a well-ripened Stilton. This method is not\r\nso certain as in the inoculation of Roquefort.\r\n\r\n=Camembert cheese.= A typical example of soft cheese is one of the\r\nFrench types, known as Camembert. This cheese is prepared from cow's\r\nmilk which is curdled by rennet. The curd is not cut but is dipped\r\ninto the forms, which condition, taken with the absence of pressure\r\nin forming the cheese, accounts for the large quantity of whey in\r\nit. The finished cheese are about one inch in thickness and three\r\ninches in diameter. In the ripening, the moisture and temperature of\r\nthe curing room are very carefully regulated.\r\n\r\nThe first stage in the ripening is due to the rennet and the lactic\r\nbacteria. Later there appears on the surface of the moist cheese, a\r\nmoldy growth. In this, there are at least two kinds of molds, the\r\nordinary mold that appears on sour milk, _Oidium lactis_, and\r\nanother that is related to the bread mold but which has a white\r\ninstead of a green fruiting stage. These molds are confined to the\r\nsurface of the cheese but the enzymes which they produce diffuse\r\ninto the substance, changing the color from a dull, opaque white to\r\na translucent yellow. The acid that has been formed by the lactic\r\nbacteria is gradually used up by the growth of the mold, and\r\nconditions then become favorable for the growth of putrefactive\r\nbacteria which digest the curd. The cheese is ready for use when the\r\naction of the mold has penetrated to the center of the cheese, and\r\nbefore any pronounced putrefaction has taken place. The production\r\nof the typical flavor is dependent upon there being a definite\r\nrelation between the growth of the molds and bacteria. This relation\r\nis dependent largely upon the moisture and temperature of the curing\r\nroom. These cannot always be regulated with exactness; and hence,\r\nmuch of this type of cheese is not of first quality, and must be\r\nsold for a low price. While such fancy cheeses, as Camembert, bring\r\nfifty cents and upward per pound, and the yield from the milk is\r\nmuch greater than with the hard type of cheese, yet the difficulties\r\nof successful manufacture are such as to make success less easily\r\nattained than with the other types.\r\n\r\nThere are many other kinds of soft cheese that depend for their\r\nripening upon factors similar to those concerned in the ripening of\r\nCamembert; most of them are, however, of small importance from a\r\ncommercial standpoint.\r\n\r\n=Limburger cheese.= A very famous cheese is one originally made in\r\nGermany to which the name Limburger is given. It is classed as a\r\nsoft cheese although it is much firmer than Camembert. This cheese\r\nis made from cow's milk and is pressed very lightly or not at all,\r\nwhich condition accounts for its high per cent (50 per cent) of\r\nmoisture. The surface is kept moist by repeated washing of the\r\ncheese, and by keeping the air of the curing room very moist. A\r\nyellowish, slimy, bacterial layer soon develops on the surface under\r\nthese conditions. The enzymes produced by this external growth\r\ngradually diffuse to the center of the cheese, when it is regarded\r\nas ripe. The odor of the matured product is somewhat putrefactive,\r\nbut is not so offensive as is usually supposed.\r\n\r\nDefinite knowledge concerning the types of organisms concerned in\r\nthe surface layer is very limited. It is not certain whether the\r\nsame kinds of organisms must always be present. Limburger is much\r\neasier to make than Camembert, due possibly to the fact that there\r\nare not needed definite forms of life and that the balance between\r\nthem is not so delicate.\r\n\r\nA cheese known as brick is closely related to Limburger in its\r\nmethod of making and of ripening but is less pronounced in flavor.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of all of these types of cheese, troubles are\r\nlikely to develop, due to an abnormal bacterial condition of the\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from what has been said that the bacteria are\r\nessential factors in cheese ripening, and that the cheese industry,\r\nlike the butter industry, may be called a true fermentation\r\nindustry. Close co-operation must exist between the milk producer,\r\nand the maker so that the type of fermentation that goes on in the\r\nmilk can be controlled. A recognition of the fundamental principles\r\ngoverning these fermentations, both normal as well as abnormal, is\r\nnow regarded as an essential part of the training of the dairy\r\nmanufacturer of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA IN MARKET MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the last decade attention has been especially directed toward\r\nthe quality of milk that is furnished to the people in the cities.\r\nThis has come about, in part, in connection with the demands made\r\nfor better and purer food of every kind. These demands are reflected\r\nin the pure-food laws enacted by the federal government, and by the\r\nvarious states and municipalities. Another factor that has focused\r\nattention on the milk supplies has been the belief that it plays an\r\nimportant role in the production and distribution of disease,\r\nespecially among children. The rapid growth of cities in all of the\r\ngreat countries of the world, the higher standard of living, and the\r\ngreater demand for milk and other dairy products, has, of necessity,\r\nwidened the zone from which the milk supply of any particular city\r\nmust be drawn. Milk is now an article of export and of import; some\r\nof the great cities draw a portion of their supply from farms\r\nhundreds of miles away. This means that a longer time must elapse\r\nbetween the time of production and consumption, necessitating the\r\nexercise of greater care in production and handling in order to\r\npreserve the milk until it reaches the consumer.\r\n\r\nIn the past in the cities, as in the smaller towns at present, the\r\nsupply was largely furnished by the producer directly to the\r\nconsumer. This direct contact afforded the consumer the opportunity\r\nof informing himself of the conditions under which his milk supply\r\nwas produced if he desired. The advent of the middleman in the\r\nbusiness, and the gathering of the milk from many hundreds of farms,\r\nand its redistribution to thousands of homes has made it impossible\r\nfor the individual consumer to learn anything of the conditions\r\nsurrounding production. When the individual cannot protect himself\r\nagainst fraud and unhealthful conditions, it is the duty of the\r\ngovernment to protect him. This is the theory underlying the modern\r\ncontrol of food supplies, water supplies, and of living conditions\r\nin general. Acting on this basis the cities are seeking to control,\r\nto an increasing degree, the healthfulness and cleanliness of the\r\nmilk supply.\r\n\r\nFormerly such control as was given was largely with reference to the\r\ncomposition of the milk, the regulations providing that it should\r\ncontain not less than a minimum amount of fat and other solids, and\r\nbe free from preservatives. The more modern regulations are much\r\nmore complex and touch every phase of production and handling that\r\ncan, in any way, affect the value of the milk as human food.\r\n\r\n=Municipal regulations.= The different cities vary widely in the\r\nmethods employed to secure a satisfactory milk supply. Rules and\r\nregulations are adopted to which the producer and dealer must\r\nconform. In order to ascertain whether the regulations are being\r\nobeyed, two types of examinations may be made: first the inspection\r\nof the farms and of the plants of the dealers; second the\r\nexamination of the milk itself with reference to its chemical\r\ncomposition, bacterial content and temperature.\r\n\r\nThe city of New York is doing more to safeguard and to improve its\r\nmilk supply than any other large city in this country. A brief\r\nsummary of its regulations and methods follow. A copy of the rules\r\nis furnished to each dairyman and is supposed to be posted in the\r\nstable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cows.\r\n\r\n1. The cows must be kept clean, and manure must not be permitted to\r\ncollect upon the tail, sides, udder and belly of any milch cow.\r\n\r\n2. The cows should be groomed daily, and all collections of manure,\r\nmud or other filth must not be allowed to remain upon their flanks,\r\nudders or bellies during milking.\r\n\r\n3. The clipping of long hairs from the udder and flanks of the cows\r\nis of assistance in preventing the collection of filth which may\r\ndrop into the milk. The hair on the tails should be cut, so that the\r\nbrush will be well above the ground.\r\n\r\n4. The udders and teats of the cow should be thoroughly cleaned\r\nbefore milking; this to be done by thorough brushing and the use of\r\na cloth and warm water.\r\n\r\n5. To prevent the cows from lying down and getting dirty between\r\ncleaning and milking, a throat latch of rope or chain should be\r\nfastened across the stanchions under the cow's neck.\r\n\r\n6. Only feed which is of good quality and only grain and coarse\r\nfodders which are free from dirt and mould should be used.\r\nDistillery waste or any substance in a state of fermentation or\r\nputrefaction must not be fed.\r\n\r\n7. Cows which are not in good flesh and condition should be\r\nimmediately removed and their milk kept separate until their health\r\nhas been passed upon by a veterinarian.\r\n\r\n8. An examination by a veterinary surgeon should be made at least\r\nonce a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stable.\r\n\r\n9. No stagnant water, hog-pen, privy or uncovered cesspool or manure\r\npit should be maintained within 100 feet of the cow stable.\r\n\r\n10. The cow stable should be provided with some adequate means of\r\nventilation, either by the construction of sufficient air chutes\r\nextending from the room in which the cows are kept to the outside\r\nair, or by the installation of muslin stretched over the window\r\nopenings.\r\n\r\n11. Windows should be installed in the cow barn to provide\r\nsufficient light (2 sq. feet of window light to each 600 cubic feet\r\nof air space the minimum) and the window panes be washed and kept\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n12. There should be at least 600 cubic feet of air space for each\r\ncow.\r\n\r\n13. Milch Cows should be kept in a place which is used for no other\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n14. Stable floors should be made water-tight, be properly graded and\r\nwell drained, and be of some non-absorbent material. Cement or brick\r\nfloors are the best, as they can be more easily kept clean than\r\nthose of wood or earth.\r\n\r\n15. The feeding troughs and platforms should be well lighted and\r\nkept clean at all times.\r\n\r\n16. The ceiling should be thoroughly swept down and kept free from\r\nhanging straw, dirt and cobwebs.\r\n\r\n17. The ceiling must be so constructed that dust and dirt therefrom\r\nshall not readily fall to the floor or into the milk. If the space\r\nover the cows is used for storage of hay, the ceiling should be made\r\ntight to prevent chaff and dust from falling through.\r\n\r\n18. The walls and ledges should be thoroughly swept down and kept\r\nfree from dust, dirt, manure or cobwebs, and the floors and\r\npremises be kept free from dirt, rubbish and decaying animal or\r\nvegetable matter at all times.\r\n\r\n19. The cow beds should be so graded and kept that they will be\r\nclean and sanitary at all times.\r\n\r\n20. Stables should be whitewashed at least twice a year unless the\r\nwalls are painted or are of smooth cement.\r\n\r\n21. Manure must be removed from the stalls and gutters at least\r\ntwice daily. This must not be done during milking, nor within one\r\nhour prior thereto.\r\n\r\n22. Manure should be taken from the barn, preferably drawn to the\r\nfield. When the weather is such that this cannot be done, it should\r\nbe stored not nearer than 200 ft. from the stable and the manure\r\npile should be so located that the cows cannot get at it.\r\n\r\n23. The liquid matter should be absorbed and removed daily and at no\r\ntime be allowed to overflow or saturate the ground under or around\r\nthe cow barn.\r\n\r\n24. Manure gutters should be from six to eight inches deep, and\r\nconstructed of concrete, stone or some non-absorbent material.\r\n\r\n25. The use of land plaster or lime is recommended upon the floors\r\nand gutters.\r\n\r\n26. Only bedding which is clean, dry and absorbent should be used,\r\npreferably sawdust, shavings, dried leaves or straw. No horse manure\r\nshould be used as bedding.\r\n\r\n27. The flooring where the cows stand should be so constructed that\r\nall manure may drop into the gutter and not upon the floor itself.\r\n\r\n28. The floor should be swept daily. This must not be done within\r\none hour prior to milking time.\r\n\r\n29. If individual drinking basins are used for the cows, they should\r\nbe frequently drained and cleaned.\r\n\r\n30. All live stock other than cows should be excluded from the room\r\nin which the milch cows are kept. (Calf or bull pens may be allowed\r\nin the same room if kept in the same clean and sanitary manner as\r\nthe cow beds.)\r\n\r\n31. The barnyard should be well drained and dry, and should be as\r\nmuch sheltered as possible from the wind and cold. Manure should not\r\nbe allowed to collect therein.\r\n\r\n32. A suitable place in some separate building should be provided\r\nfor the use of the cows when sick, and separate quarters must be\r\nprovided for the cows when calving.\r\n\r\n33. There should be no direct opening from any silo or grain pit\r\ninto the room in which the milch cows are kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Milk House.\r\n\r\n34. A milk house must be provided which is separated from the stable\r\nand dwelling. It should be located on elevated ground, with no\r\nhog-pen, privy or manure pile within 100 feet.\r\n\r\n35. It must be kept clean and not used for any purpose except the\r\nhandling of milk.\r\n\r\n36. The milk house should be provided with sufficient light and\r\nventilation, with floors properly graded and made water-tight.\r\n\r\n37. It should be provided with adjustable sashes to furnish\r\nsufficient light and some proper method of ventilation should be\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\n38. The milk house should be provided with an ample supply of clean\r\nwater for cooling the milk, and if it is not a running supply, the\r\nwater should be changed twice daily. Also a supply of clean ice\r\nshould be provided to be used for cooling the milk to 50 degrees\r\nwithin two hours after milking.\r\n\r\n39. Suitable means should be provided within the milk house, to\r\nexpose the milk pails, cans and utensils to the sun or to live\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\n40. Facilities consisting of wash basins, soap and towel should be\r\nprovided for the use of milkers before and during milking. During\r\nthe Summer Months the Milk House should be properly screened to\r\nexclude flies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Milkers and Milking.\r\n\r\n41. Any person having any communicable or infectious disease, or one\r\ncaring for persons having such disease, must not be allowed to\r\nhandle the milk or milk utensils.\r\n\r\n42. The hands of the milkers must be thoroughly washed with soap and\r\nwater, and carefully dried on a clean towel before milking.\r\n\r\n43. Clean overalls and jumpers should be worn during the milking of\r\nthe cows. They should be used for no other purpose, and when not in\r\nuse should be kept in a clean place protected from dust.\r\n\r\n44. The hands and teats should be kept dry during milking. The\r\npractice of moistening the hands with milk is to be condemned.\r\n\r\n45. The milking stools should be at all times kept clean, and iron\r\nstools are recommended.\r\n\r\n46. The first streams from each teat should be rejected, as this\r\nfore milk contains more bacteria than the rest of the milk.\r\n\r\n47. All milk drawn from the cows 15 days before, or 5 days after\r\nparturition should be rejected.\r\n\r\n48. The pails in which the milk is drawn should have as small an\r\nopening at the top as can be used in milking; top opening preferably\r\nnot to exceed 8 inches in diameter. This lessens the contamination\r\nby dust and dirt during milking.\r\n\r\n49. The milking should be done rapidly and quietly, and the cows\r\nshould be treated kindly.\r\n\r\n50. Dry fodder should not be fed to the cows during or just before\r\nmilking, as dust therefrom may fall into the milk.\r\n\r\n51. All milk utensils, including pails, cans, strainers, and\r\ndippers, must be kept thoroughly clean and must be washed and\r\nscalded after each using, and all seams in these utensils should be\r\ncleaned, scraped and soldered flush.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Milk.\r\n\r\n52. Milk from diseased cows must not be shipped.\r\n\r\n53. The milk must not be in any way adulterated.\r\n\r\n54. The milk as soon as drawn should be removed to the milk house\r\nand immediately strained and cooled to the proper temperature.\r\n\r\n55. All milk must be cooled to a temperature below 50 degrees F.,\r\nwithin two hours after being drawn, and kept thereafter below that\r\nuntil delivered to the creamery.\r\n\r\n56. The milk should be strained into cans which are standing in ice\r\nwater which reaches the neck of the can. The more rapidly the milk\r\nis cooled, the safer it is, and longer it will keep sweet. Ice\r\nshould be used in cooling milk, as very few springs are cold enough\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\n57. If aerators are used, they should stand where the air is free\r\nfrom dust or odors, and on no account should they be used in the\r\nstable or out of doors.\r\n\r\n58. Milk strainers should be kept clean; scalded a second time just\r\nbefore using, and if cloth strainers are used, several of them\r\nshould be provided, in order that they may be frequently changed\r\nduring the straining of the milk.\r\n\r\n59. The use of any preservative or coloring matter is adulteration,\r\nand its use by a producer or shipper will be a sufficient cause for\r\nthe exclusion of his product from the City of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater Supply.\r\n\r\n60. The water supply used in the dairy and for washing utensils\r\nshould be absolutely free from any contamination, sufficiently\r\nabundant for all purposes, and easy to access.\r\n\r\n61. This supply should be protected against flood or surface\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\n62. The privy should be located not nearer than 100 feet of the\r\nsource of the water supply, or else be provided with a water-tight\r\nbox that can be readily removed and cleaned, and so constructed that\r\nat no time will the contents overflow or saturate the surrounding\r\nground.\r\n\r\n63. The source of the water supply should be rendered safe against\r\ncontamination by having no stable, barnyard, pile of manure or other\r\nsource of contamination located within 200 feet of it.\r\n\r\nIn order that the farm inspection shall be as effective as possible,\r\nand to make the work of the several inspectors as uniform as may be,\r\nthe dairies are scored.

The temperature of the milk and its\r\ncleanliness are noted. In the creamery the straining, cooling and\r\nhandling of the milk are observed as well as the washing of the milk\r\ncans and other utensils, and the construction and condition of the\r\ncreamery, the opportunity for the water supply to become\r\ncontaminated, and the presence of infectious diseases among the\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n=Grades of milk.= Three grades of milk have been established. Each\r\ndealer is required to state which grade or grades he expects to\r\nhandle. The specifications for the different grades are as follows.\r\n\r\n_Grade A. Guaranteed Milk._ Guaranteed milk is that produced at\r\nfarms holding permits therefor from the Department of Health and\r\nproduced and handled in accordance with the following minimum\r\nrequirements, rules and regulations:\r\n\r\n1. Only such cows shall be admitted to the herd as have not re-acted\r\nto a diagnostic injection of tuberculin.\r\n\r\n2. All cows shall be annually tested with tuberculin, and all\r\nre-acting animals shall be excluded from the herd.\r\n\r\n3. No milk from re-acting animals shall be shipped to the City of\r\nNew York for any purpose whatever.\r\n\r\n4. The milk shall not contain more than 30,000 bacteria per c. c.\r\nwhen delivered to the consumer, or at any time prior to such\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n5. The milk shall be delivered to the consumer only in sealed\r\nbottles, which have been sealed at the dairy.\r\n\r\n6. The milk shall be delivered to the consumer within 30 hours of\r\nthe time at which it was drawn.\r\n\r\n_Grade A. Certified Milk._ Certified milk is milk certified by a\r\nmilk commission appointed by the Medical Society of the County of\r\nNew York, or the Medical Society of the County of Kings, as being\r\nproduced under the supervision and in conformity with the\r\nrequirements of that commission as laid down for certified milk, and\r\nsold under a permit therefor issued by the Board of Health.\r\n\r\nNo milk shall be held, kept, offered for sale, or sold and delivered\r\nas certified milk in the City of New York which is produced under\r\nrequirements less than those for guaranteed milk.\r\n\r\n_Grade A. Inspected Milk--Raw._ Inspected milk (raw) is milk\r\nproduced at farms holding permits therefor from the Board of Health,\r\nand produced and handled in accordance with the following minimum\r\nrequirements, rules and regulations:\r\n\r\n1. Only such cows shall be admitted to the herd as have not re-acted\r\nto a diagnostic injection of tuberculin.\r\n\r\n2. All cows shall be tested annually with tuberculin, and all\r\nre-acting animals shall be excluded from the herd.\r\n\r\n3. No milk from re-acting animals shall be shipped to the City of\r\nNew York for any purpose whatsoever.\r\n\r\n4. The farms at which the milk is produced must obtain at least 75\r\npoints in an official score of the Department of Health. These 75\r\npoints shall be made up as follows: A minimum of 25 points for\r\nequipment, and 50 points for method.\r\n\r\n5. The milk shall not contain more than an average of 60,000\r\nbacteria per c. c. when delivered to the consumer, or at any time\r\nprior thereto.\r\n\r\n6. Unless otherwise specified in the permit, the milk shall be\r\ndelivered to the consumer only in bottles.\r\n\r\n_Grade A. Selected Milk--Pasteurized._ Selected milk (pasteurized)\r\nis milk produced at farms holding permits therefor from the Board of\r\nHealth, and produced and handled in accordance with the following\r\nrequirements, rules and regulations:\r\n\r\n1. The farms at which the milk is produced must obtain at least 60\r\npoints in an official score of the Department of Health. Of these 60\r\npoints, a minimum of 20 points shall be required for equipment and a\r\nminimum of 40 points for method.\r\n\r\n2. All milk of this grade shall be pasteurized, and said\r\npasteurization shall be carried on under a special permit issued\r\ntherefor by the Board of Health, in addition to the permit for\r\n\"Selected Milk (Pasteurized.)\"\r\n\r\n3. The milk shall not contain more than an average of 50,000\r\nbacteria per c. c. when delivered to the consumer, or at any time\r\nafter pasteurization and prior to such delivery.\r\n\r\n4. Unless otherwise specified in the permit, the milk shall be\r\ndelivered to the consumer only in bottles.\r\n\r\n5. All containers in which pasteurized milk is delivered to the\r\nconsumer shall be plainly labeled \"Pasteurized.\" Labels must also\r\nbear the date and hour when pasteurization was completed, the place\r\nwhere pasteurization was performed, and the name of the person, firm\r\nor corporation performing the pasteurization.\r\n\r\n6. The milk must be delivered to the consumers within 30 hours after\r\nthe completion of the process of pasteurization.\r\n\r\n7. No milk shall be pasteurized more than once.\r\n\r\n8. No milk containing in excess of 200,000 bacteria per c. c. shall\r\nbe pasteurized.\r\n\r\n_General Regulations for Grade A_--\r\n\r\n1. The caps of all bottles containing milk of Grade A shall be\r\nwhite, and shall contain the words \"Grade A\" in black letters, in\r\nlarge type.\r\n\r\n2. If cans are used for the delivery of milk for Grade A, the said\r\ncans shall have affixed to them white tags, with the words \"Grade A\"\r\nprinted thereon in black letters, in large type, together with the\r\ndesignation \"Inspected Milk (Raw)\" or \"Selected Milk (Pasteurized),\"\r\nas the quality of the contents may require.\r\n\r\n_Grade B. Selected Milk--Raw._ Selected milk (raw) is milk produced\r\nat farms holding permits therefor from the Board of Health, and\r\nproduced and handled in accordance with the following minimum\r\nrequirements, rules and regulations:\r\n\r\n1. Only such cows shall be admitted to the herd as have been\r\nphysically examined by a regularly qualified veterinarian and\r\ndeclared by him to be healthy, and free from tuberculosis in so far\r\nas a physical examination may determine that fact.\r\n\r\n2. The farms at which the milk is produced must obtain at least 68\r\npoints in an official score of the Department of Health. These 68\r\npoints shall be made up as follows: A minimum of 25 points for\r\nequipment, and a minimum of 43 points for method.\r\n\r\n3. The milk shall not contain an excessive number of bacteria when\r\ndelivered to the consumer, or at any time prior thereto.\r\n\r\n_Grade B. Pasteurized Milk._ Pasteurized milk (Grade B) is milk\r\nproduced under a permit issued therefor by the Board of Health,\r\nand produced and handled in accordance with the following minimum\r\nrequirements, rules and regulations and in further accordance with\r\nthe special rules and regulations relating to the pasteurization of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n1. The milk after pasteurization must be at once cooled and placed\r\nin sterilized containers, and the containers immediately closed.\r\n\r\n2. All containers in which pasteurized milk is delivered to the\r\nconsumer shall be plainly labeled \"Pasteurized\". Labels must also\r\nbear the date and hour when the pasteurization was completed, the\r\nplace where pasteurization was performed, and the name of the\r\nperson, firm or corporation performing the pasteurization.\r\n\r\n3. The milk must be delivered to the consumer within 36 hours after\r\nthe completion of the process of pasteurization.\r\n\r\n4. No milk shall be pasteurized more than once.\r\n\r\n5. No milk containing an excessive number of bacteria shall be\r\npasteurized.\r\n\r\n_General Regulations for Grade B_--\r\n\r\n1. Caps of bottles containing milk of grade B shall be white and\r\nmarked \"Grade B\" in bright green letters of large type.\r\n\r\n2. The necks and shoulders of cans containing grade B milk shall be\r\npainted bright green, and a metal tag shall be attached to each can\r\nwith the words \"Grade B\" in large type, and the words of the\r\nsubdivision to which the quality of the milk in said can conforms.\r\n\r\n_Grade C._ Grade C is to be used for cooking and manufacturing\r\npurposes only. It includes all raw milk that does not conform to the\r\nrequirements of any of the subdivisions of grade A or grade B.\r\n\r\n1. The caps of all bottles containing milk of grade C shall be white\r\nand shall contain in red the words \"Grade C\" in large type and \"for\r\ncooking\" in plainly visible type.\r\n\r\n2. Cans containing milk of grade C shall be painted red on necks and\r\nshoulders and shall have in red the words \"Grade C\" in large type\r\nand the words \"for cooking\" in plainly visible type affixed to each\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nAll creameries handling milk of different grades will be required to\r\ndemonstrate to the Department of Health that they are capable of\r\nkeeping the grades separate, and must keep records satisfactory to\r\nthe Department of Health concerning the amount of milk of each grade\r\nhandled each day.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the grades of milk are based on the bacterial\r\ncontent of the milk and on the opportunity for the milk to become\r\ncontaminated with pathogenic organisms. From the statements made in\r\na previous chapter it is evident that the number of bacteria in any\r\nsample of milk is dependent upon (1) the original amount of\r\ncontamination, (2) the age of the milk, and (3) the temperature at\r\nwhich it has been held. A high bacterial content is indicative of\r\npoor milk, while a low bacterial content can be obtained, in the\r\ncase of raw milk, only where due attention is paid to cleanliness\r\nand cooling. This relation between the quality of milk and its\r\nbacterial content has led many cities to adopt numerical bacterial\r\nstandards, even when grades of milk have not been established.\r\nBoston requires that the milk shall not contain more than 500,000\r\nbacteria per cubic centimeter. Rochester, N. Y., has a standard of\r\n100,000 per cubic centimeter, while Chicago requires that the milk\r\non arrival in the city shall not contain more than 1,000,000 per\r\ncubic centimeter from May first to September thirtieth, and not over\r\n500,000 between October first and April thirtieth. The sale of milk\r\ncontaining more than 3,000,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter is\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged that bacterial standards are not of value since\r\nthe healthfulness of milk depends on the kind of bacteria present\r\nrather than on the number. It is well recognized that milk\r\ncontaining millions of acid-forming organisms, butter milk, is a\r\nhealthful food, while that containing many less bacteria may contain\r\nsome disease-producing organisms. It has been urged that a\r\nqualitative standard should supplant the quantitative. The consumer\r\ndesires milk that has been produced under clean conditions, and\r\nwhich has good keeping qualities. The harmless forms of bacteria\r\nexert the greatest influence on the keeping quality. Experience has\r\nshown that the quantitative examination of the milk supply as\r\nit comes from the farm is the most feasible method of determining,\r\nin the laboratory, whether the farmer has obeyed the rules\r\nwith reference to cleanliness and cooling of the milk. The\r\nbacteriological examination also gives an indication as to whether\r\nthe large number of bacteria is due to gross contamination of the\r\nmilk with mud and manure, or actual growth of bacteria as in old\r\nmilk. In the latter case the ordinary acid-forming bacteria will\r\nusually predominate in the milk, while in the former, the number of\r\nkinds of bacteria and the proportion between the kinds will be\r\nchanged. It is of course evident that the quantitative standards\r\nshould be applied with judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is also claimed that the delay in securing the results in the\r\nquantitative examination of milk is an objection to the bacterial\r\nstandard, since the milk is consumed before the laboratory findings\r\ncan be obtained. It is true that it does not protect the community\r\nas far as the particular sample is concerned, but it is also true\r\nthat the examination is not made for the purpose of determining the\r\ncondition of the particular sample, so much as it is to determine\r\nthe methods that are employed on any particular farm, and these do\r\nnot vary widely from day to day. Thus, if a number of samples give\r\nhigh results, it is evident that conditions surrounding production\r\nneed investigation.\r\n\r\nIf the milk is well cooled on the farm, and kept cold while being\r\nshipped, the growth of bacteria will be slow, and the condition of\r\nthe milk as far as keeping quality is concerned, much better than if\r\nless care is used. Some cities have temperature standards; New York\r\nrequires that the milk shall be cooled to 50° F. on the farm, and\r\nshall not be above 50° F. on arrival in the city. Others require\r\nthat it shall not be above 50° F. on delivery to the consumer.\r\n\r\n=Certified milk.= In many cities the Medical Societies have appointed\r\nMilk Commissions, that adopt rules and regulations, concerning the\r\nproduction of milk that shall receive the certificate of the\r\ncommission. Producers, who desire to have their milk thus certified,\r\nmust satisfy the commission that they are able to conform to the\r\nrules. The commission appoints a physician to examine the personnel\r\nof the farm, a veterinarian to make frequent examinations of the\r\nherd, a chemist to examine the milk as to its contents in fat and\r\nother solids, and a bacteriologist to determine the bacterial\r\ncontent of the milk. The rules are very stringent and cover every\r\npoint that may influence, in any way, the value of the milk as human\r\nfood. In order to conform to these requirements, a heavy\r\nexpenditure must be incurred, and the business must pay for such\r\nexpert service; hence, certified milk must be sold at high prices,\r\ntwelve to twenty-five cents per quart. This price makes it a special\r\nproduct and its use is confined mainly to infant feeding.\r\n\r\nThe bacterial standard for certified milk is usually 10,000 bacteria\r\nper cubic centimeter. It is only by the exercise of the greatest\r\ncare at every point that the bacterial content can be kept below\r\nthis maximum.\r\n\r\nThe term \"certified milk\" has been registered by Mr. Francisco of\r\nNew Jersey, who was the first to engage in the production of such\r\nmilk under the direction of the Medical Milk Commission of Essex\r\nCounty, New Jersey. The use of the term is allowed when the milk is\r\nproduced under the regulation of any Medical Milk Commission.\r\n\r\nMost certified milk is now produced on fancy dairy farms conducted\r\nby wealthy men. The barns and other equipment are the best that can\r\nbe obtained, and the methods employed, as far as cleanliness is\r\nconcerned, are extreme. In some of the dairies the bacterial content\r\nis reduced to a few hundred per cubic centimeter, or to that which\r\nis derived from the interior of the udder. Such milk will, when well\r\nrefrigerated, keep for long periods of time. It is a not uncommon\r\nthing for such milk to keep perfectly sweet for ten to fifteen days.\r\n\r\n=Tests for the quality of milk.= At the milk depot and elsewhere, it\r\nis frequently desired to determine the bacterial condition of the\r\nmilk in a less refined manner than by the plate cultures of the\r\nbacteriologist, which require a large amount of time for their\r\npreparation and do not yield any positive information for at least\r\ntwenty-four hours. There are a number of such tests that may be\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Sediment Testers.\r\n\r\nIn the use of the apparatus on the right, increased air pressure is\r\nused to hasten the filtering process; the same is accomplished in\r\nthe apparatus shown in the center by warming the milk by the\r\ninjection of steam between the walls of the double jacket.]\r\n\r\n1. _Dirt or sediment test._ This is made by filtering a pint of the\r\nmixed milk through a small disc of absorbent cotton. The insoluble\r\ndirt is retained and imparts a color to the cotton, the shade of\r\nwhich is dependent on the amount of dirt (P. 45). Since it is\r\nimpossible to have dirt without bacteria, it is evident that milks\r\ncontaining a large amount of dirt will be high in bacteria. The\r\nreverse, however, is not necessarily true.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Good Milk.\r\n\r\nA plate culture inoculated with 1/100 of a cubic centimeter of milk\r\ncontaining 67 colonies, which equals 6,700 bacteria per cubic\r\ncentimeter of milk. Such milk will keep well.]\r\n\r\n2. _Acidity test._ The acidity of the milk is also an indication of\r\nits bacterial content. If the acidity has increased, above the\r\nnormal for fresh milk, the bacterial content is certain to be high,\r\nand the keeping quality poor. An acidity above 0.2 per cent in\r\nmarket milk is to be avoided, as an increase in acidity is always\r\npreceded by a great increase of bacteria.\r\n\r\nWhether the acidity is above or below this point can be rapidly and\r\neasily determined at the receiving station by a modification of\r\nthe Farrington acid test. Dissolve one alkaline tablet in an ounce\r\nof water. A unit volume of this solution added to a unit volume of\r\nmilk is equal to 0.1 per cent of acidity. If two measures are\r\nprovided,--one for the alkaline solution holding just twice as much\r\nas that used for the milk, the approximate acidity can be quickly\r\ndetermined by mixing a measure of each in a common white cup. If the\r\nacidity is above 0.2 per cent the color will remain white; if a pink\r\ncolor develops, it indicates an acidity less than this amount.\r\nThis test is also useful in the selection of milk or cream that is\r\nto be used for special purposes, such as pasteurization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Poor Milk.\r\n\r\nA plate culture inoculated with 1/1000 of a cubic centimeter of\r\nmarket milk containing 1,680 colonies, which equals 1,680,000\r\nbacteria per cubic centimeter. Such milk has poor keeping\r\nqualities.]\r\n\r\n3. _Alcohol test._ A test giving similar information is made by\r\nadding two parts of 70 per cent alcohol to one part of milk, and\r\nnoting whether curdling occurs.\r\n\r\n4. _Curd test._ The curd test described on p. 100 gives no\r\nindication of the number of bacteria present, only concerning the\r\ntypes present. It has been proposed to combine the fermentation test\r\nwith the reduction test referred to below and thus gain some idea\r\nof, not only the number, but the kinds of bacteria present.\r\n\r\n5. _Reduction test._ The reduction test is made by adding to twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of milk, one-half cubic centimeter of a solution\r\nof methylene blue, a coal tar dye. A saturated solution of the dye\r\nis made in alcohol, and 2.5 per cent of this solution added to\r\nwater. The time required for the reduction of the dye or the change\r\nof the color from blue to white when the samples are placed in tubes\r\nand kept at 98 to 100° F., is dependent upon the number of bacteria\r\npresent. By allowing the tubes to stand until curdling occurs, and\r\nnoting the nature of the curd, whether the solid curd of the\r\ndesirable acid-forming bacteria or the gassy curd of the harmful\r\ntypes is produced, knowledge is gained of the kinds of bacteria\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Barthel, milks that reduce the methylene blue within\r\nfifteen minutes contain hundreds of thousands of bacteria per cubic\r\ncentimeter. Those that require from fifteen minutes to one hour for\r\nthe disappearance of the color are also high in bacteria, and are to\r\nbe classed as a poor grade of market milk. If one to three hours is\r\nrequired, the milk is comparatively low in bacteria, and is to be\r\nclassed as a good grade of market milk. When more than three hours\r\nelapse before the disappearance of the blue color, the bacterial\r\ncontent is low and the milk is to be placed in the highest grade.\r\n\r\nThe time of reduction is only a rough index of the number of\r\nbacteria present, but it gives a good idea of the keeping quality of\r\nthe milk, and of the conditions of production and handling. Of the\r\nabove tests the sediment and acid tests are more frequently used.\r\n\r\n=Examination of milk sediments.= In the modern municipal laboratory,\r\nefforts are made to determine, as far as possible, the conditions of\r\nproduction on the farms, by an examination of the milk in the\r\nlaboratory. The samples of milk are sedimented in a small\r\ncentrifuge, and an examination of the sediment made with the\r\nmicroscope. The types of bacteria and the number of body cells found\r\nis an indication as to whether any of the animals of the herd are\r\nsuffering from inflammation of the udder. The test also gives\r\ninformation similar to the dirt test since the insoluble dirt will\r\nbe thrown down and will impart a color to the sediment.\r\n\r\n=Pasteurization of market milk.=.The spread of the pasteurizing\r\nprocess as applied to market milk has been rapid. This has been due\r\nto the recognition of the fact that only by this process can a safe\r\nmilk _i.e._, one free from pathogenic bacteria, be obtained. As\r\npreviously mentioned a small proportion of all human beings that\r\nhave suffered from typhoid fever become bacillus carriers. It is\r\nimpossible to examine all persons who may be concerned in the\r\nhandling of milk in order to ascertain whether they belong to this\r\ndangerous and unfortunate class of people.\r\n\r\nThe larger cities have also recognized the impossibility of\r\nrequiring the tuberculin test of all cattle furnishing milk.\r\nPasteurization remains the only safeguard, and it is probable that\r\nwithin a short time all the larger cities will require the\r\npasteurization of all milk, except that produced under strict\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned heating causes certain changes in milk. In\r\nthe treatment of market milk it is desirable to use as low\r\ntemperatures as will suffice to destroy the disease-producing\r\nbacteria. It is fortunate that temperatures that will insure this\r\nresult have little effect on the milk. The temperatures now\r\nrecommended for pasteurization are as follows:\r\n\r\n  158 degrees F. for 3 minutes.\r\n  155 degrees F. for 5 minutes.\r\n  152 degrees F. for 10 minutes.\r\n  148 degrees F. for 15 minutes.\r\n  145 degrees F. for 18 minutes.\r\n  140 degrees F. for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice the milk is heated to 145 degrees for 25 to 30\r\nminutes. The acid-forming bacteria are not completely destroyed and\r\nthe pasteurized milk as a rule will undergo the same type of\r\nfermentation as raw milk. It is, however, deemed essential that all\r\npasteurized milk be sold as such; that it be delivered to the\r\nconsumer within twenty-four hours after pasteurization and that no\r\nmilk be pasteurized a second time.\r\n\r\nThe continuous pasteurizing machines have the disadvantage that a\r\nsmall portion of the milk passes through so quickly that all\r\npathogenic bacteria therein might not be destroyed, (p. 131). This\r\nhas led to the use of the \"holding\" process in which the milk is\r\nheated to the desired temperature and then placed in tanks where it\r\nremains at this temperature for any desired time. Every portion is\r\nthus treated in a uniform manner.\r\n\r\nIf the milk is bottled after pasteurization, there remains\r\nopportunity for reinfection, possibly with typhoid bacilli.\r\nPasteurization in the final container, the bottle, is being\r\nrecommended. This is possible only when a special bottle is used\r\nwith a metal cap lined with paper.\r\n\r\n=Milk distribution.= Until within recent years in the cities and at\r\npresent in smaller towns, milk is largely retailed from cans which\r\nare carried on the wagons or are kept in stores. This exposes the\r\nmilk to contamination from street dust and from the container\r\nfurnished by the consumer. It is well recognized that every utensil\r\nwith which milk is brought in contact adds more or less bacteria to\r\nit, and the less milk is handled, the better will be its condition\r\nwhen it reaches the consumer. Milk is now largely retailed in glass\r\nbottles which are closed with pulp caps. In some cities the bottling\r\nis mainly done in the country at the bottling station to which the\r\nmilk is brought by the farmers; or it may be shipped by the producer\r\nto a distributing company, and all subsequent treatment, as\r\npasteurization and bottling done in the city.\r\n\r\nMilk plants are now generally equipped for the rapid and economical\r\nhandling of large quantities of milk in a most sanitary manner. The\r\nbottles as they are returned from the consumer are washed in a\r\ncontinuously-acting automatic washer which washes, rinses and\r\nsterilizes the bottles without their being removed from the cases in\r\nwhich they are carried on the wagons. These machines are effective,\r\nif not run at too rapid a rate, so that the bottles are not exposed\r\nfor a sufficiently long period of time to sterilize them. The\r\nbottles are then filled and the paper caps inserted by machinery.\r\nThe caps can now be obtained from the manufacturers in sealed\r\ntubes in which they have been sterilized so that the contamination\r\nfrom this source is avoided. The shipping cans are washed and\r\nsterilized with live steam, and in many plants are thoroughly dried,\r\nby passing hot air into them. Under these conditions they then reach\r\nthe farmer with none of the musty and disagreeable odor that\r\nfrequently is present when the can contains a small quantity of\r\nwater, condensed from steam.\r\n\r\nThe top of the milk bottle over which the milk is poured is exposed\r\nto contamination from the hands of the deliveryman. Trouble from\r\nthis source can be avoided if the consumer cleans the lip of the\r\nbottle before removing the cap. The better grades of milk are\r\ndispensed in bottles, the top of which is protected by an additional\r\ncover of paper or tin foil which reaches to the neck of the bottle\r\nand is held in place by a crimped metal band.\r\n\r\n=Milk supply of the small cities.= It is true that the quality of milk\r\nsupplied to the large cities by the great milk companies is\r\ngenerally much superior to that sold in the smaller cities and\r\nvillages. Many of the smaller places are however, attempting in\r\nvarious ways to improve their supply. It is evident that methods\r\nwill be successful here that can not be employed in the larger\r\nplaces. A detailed and careful farm inspection by a tactful, capable\r\ninspector, coupled with proper publicity will do much to improve\r\nconditions. The publication of the scores of the different farms,\r\nand the demonstration of the sediment test as applied to their\r\nproduct attracts favorable attention to the good dairies and\r\nunfavorable attention to the poor. This usually has an effect on\r\nthe trade sufficient to cause the negligent producer and dealer to\r\nimprove.\r\n\r\nIt is also becoming recognized that high grade milk can be produced\r\nwith very simple equipment. In fact the small farm is often more\r\nsuccessful in producing high grade milk than is the large farm on\r\nwhich the work must be done by hired help for here the personality\r\nof the owner can not make itself felt as where the producer is doing\r\na portion of the work about the barn and dairy himself. It is\r\nbecoming more and more evident that the chief factor in the\r\nproduction of clean milk is the personality of the producer; he\r\nshould be one who gets enjoyment out of his clean stables and cows\r\nand his high grade product.\r\n\r\nThe man who is producing milk for the city market is but one of many\r\nand his individual efforts can not make themselves felt. The\r\ndairyman who is marketing his own product is in a position where his\r\nefforts to produce a fine product should prove of distinct advantage\r\nto him in enabling him to sell it for a higher price than that\r\nobtained for ordinary milk.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the production of clean, healthful milk\r\nis not a question of equipment, but of methods and of additional\r\nwork. The cows must be fed, the stables must be cleaned, the cows\r\nmilked, and the milk delivered to the consumer. If beyond this\r\nunavoidable labor a small additional amount is expended, the\r\nimprovement in the product will be great. It is necessary that the\r\nadditional work be placed where it will do the most good, in keeping\r\nthe cows clean both summer and winter so that little need be done in\r\ncleaning them before milking, the pails and other utensils kept\r\nclean and sterilized, and the milk cooled as soon as possible and\r\nkept cold until delivered to the consumer. The delivery should be\r\nmade within the shortest practicable time after the milk is drawn.\r\nIn order that the healthfulness of the milk may be beyond question,\r\nthe herd must be kept free from tuberculosis and some attention\r\nshould be paid to the health of the men, especially with reference\r\nto whether they may be typhoid carriers or not. The necessary labor\r\nshould not increase the cost of the milk over one cent per quart. It\r\nhas been shown in many cases that such a product can be marketed at\r\na price that will more than compensate for the additional cost.\r\nClean, fresh, rich milk is being sold in villages and small cities\r\nlocated in the great butter and cheese producing sections of the\r\ncountry for eight to ten cents per quart.\r\n\r\n=The duty of the consumer.= The educational campaign that has been\r\ncarried on by the health departments with reference to farm\r\nconditions and methods of handling has been most effective in\r\nimproving the milk supply. Many cities are now extending this to the\r\nconsumer, recognizing that as much harm may be done in the home as\r\non the farm. The importance of keeping the milk cold, of not\r\nallowing it to stand exposed in open vessels, of thoroughly cleaning\r\nthe vessel in which it is kept, or the milk bottle before returning\r\nit to the milkman are especially emphasized.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it must be impressed upon the consumer that all of these\r\nimprovements, not only on the farm where the milk is produced, but\r\nin the hands of the distributing companies in the cities, involve\r\nmuch expense, and cannot be carried out, unless the consumer is\r\nwilling to pay their cost. More objection seems to be raised over\r\nan increase in the price of milk than any other food stuff. The\r\nconsumer therefore needs education along the line of higher prices\r\nfor milk. Dairy products of all types have increased much in value\r\nin recent years, so that at present prices milk, sold directly as\r\nmilk, is relatively cheaper than in any form, when prevailing prices\r\nare compared with those that obtained a decade ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbnormal fermentations, overcoming of, 108.\r\n\r\nAbortion, contagious, 75.\r\n\r\nAcid, amount of formed in milk, 84.\r\n\r\nAcidity test, 211.\r\n\r\nActinomycosis, 75.\r\n\r\nAeration of milk, 55.\r\n\r\nAerobic bacteria, 13.\r\n\r\nAir, contamination of milk from, 51.\r\n\r\nAlcohol test, 213.\r\n\r\nAlcoholic fermentation, 96.\r\n\r\nAnaerobic bacteria, 13.\r\n\r\nAnimal, contamination of milk from, 42.\r\n\r\nAnthrax, 75.\r\n\r\nAntiseptics, 16, 117.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nBacillus Bulgaricus, 89, 101.\r\n\r\nBacillus lactis acidi, 86.\r\n\r\nBacteria, aerobic, 13;\r\n  anaerobic, 13;\r\n  culture media for, 20;\r\n  desirable acid-forming, 86;\r\n  determining number of, 22;\r\n  distribution of, 18;\r\n  effect of cold on, 14;\r\n  effect of heat on, 15;\r\n  food of, 12;\r\n  forms of, 8;\r\n  manner of growth of, 9;\r\n  movement of, 11;\r\n  nature of, 8;\r\n  parasitic, 11;\r\n  products of, 17;\r\n  pure cultures of, 25;\r\n  rate of growth of, 13;\r\n  relation to air, 13;\r\n  relation to chemicals, 16;\r\n  relation to drying, 15;\r\n  relation to light, 16;\r\n  relation to temperature, 12;\r\n  size of, 9;\r\n  saprophytic, 11;\r\n  spores of, 10;\r\n  types of acid-forming, 86;\r\n  undesirable acid-forming, 90.\r\n\r\nBedding, 47.\r\n\r\nBitter fermentation, 97.\r\n\r\nBleaching powder, 112.\r\n\r\nBloody milk, 99.\r\n\r\nButter, bacteria in, 154;\r\n  bacterial defects in, 156;\r\n  cowy odor in, 157;\r\n  deterioration of, 155;\r\n  fishy, 157;\r\n  metallic, 157;\r\n  molding of, 157;\r\n  preservatives in, 155;\r\n  putrid, 156;\r\n  source of flavor, 140;\r\n  turnip flavored, 156;\r\n  types of, 137.\r\n\r\nButter-milk, 100.\r\n\r\nButyric fermentation, 93.\r\n\r\nBoric acid, 117.\r\n\r\nBorax, 117.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid, 111.\r\n\r\nCheese, abnormal fermentations of, 174;\r\n  bitter, 177;\r\n  Camembert, 186;\r\n  Cheddar, 164;\r\n  colored, 178;\r\n  flavor production in, 172;\r\n  gassy, 174;\r\n  Gorgonzola, 185;\r\n  Limburger, 187;\r\n  moldy, 179;\r\n  preservation of by acid, 171;\r\n  putrid, 178;\r\n  quality of milk for, 162;\r\n  ripening of, 169;\r\n  Roquefort, 184;\r\n  Stilton, 185;\r\n  Swiss, 180;\r\n  temperature of ripening, 173;\r\n  types of, 161.\r\n\r\nChildren, diseases of, 80.\r\n\r\nChloride of lime, 112.\r\n\r\nCholera, 80.\r\n\r\nCleaning utensils, 39.\r\n\r\nClean milk, production of, 53.\r\n\r\nCold, effect of, on bacteria, 14.\r\n\r\nColored milk, 98.\r\n\r\nCondensed milk, 135.\r\n\r\nContagious abortion, 75.\r\n\r\nContamination of milk, from milking machine, 50;\r\n  in factory, 59.\r\n\r\nCooling of milk, 54.\r\n\r\nCorrosive sublimate, 111.\r\n\r\nCream, control of fermentation of, 142;\r\n  pasteurization of, 146;\r\n  ripening of, 138;\r\n  separators, 36.\r\n\r\nCresol, 111.\r\n\r\nCurd test, 104.\r\n\r\nCycle of fermentations, 99.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\nDeodorants, 109.\r\n\r\nDigestive fermentation, 93.\r\n\r\nDiphtheria, 79.\r\n\r\nDirt, exclusion of, 44;\r\n  removal of from milk, 53.\r\n\r\nDisinfectants, 16, 109.\r\n\r\nDisinfection, 109.\r\n\r\nDistribution of bacteria, 18.\r\n\r\nDried milk, 135.\r\n\r\nDrugs, excretion of in milk, 58.\r\n\r\nDrying, effect of on bacteria, 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.\r\n\r\nEmmenthaler cheese, 180.\r\n\r\nEvaporated milk, 134.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.\r\n\r\nFactory by-products, 36;\r\n  treatment of, 38.\r\n\r\nFeeds, effect of on milk, 57.\r\n\r\nFermentation test, 104.\r\n\r\nFermented milks, 100.\r\n\r\nFly, contamination of milk by, 60;\r\n  means of spreading typhoid fever, 78.\r\n\r\nFoot and mouth disease, 74.\r\n\r\nFore milk, 31;
