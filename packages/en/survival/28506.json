In an hour he is whirled\r\ndown the slopes from the region of eternal snow to the verdure of spring\r\nor the ripeness of summer. Suddenly--it may be at a turn in the\r\nroad--winter is left behind; the plains of Lombardy are in view; the\r\nLake of Como or Maggiore gleams below; there is a tree; there is an\r\norchard; there is a garden; there is a villa overrun with vines; the\r\nsinging of birds is heard; the air is gracious; the slopes are terraced,\r\nand covered with vineyards; great sheets of silver sheen in the\r\nlandscape mark the growth of the olive; the dark green orchards of\r\noranges and lemons are starred with gold; the lusty fig, always a\r\ntemptation as of old, leans invitingly over the stone wall; everywhere\r\nare bloom and color under the blue sky; there are shrines by the\r\nway-side, chapels on the hill; one hears the melodious bells, the call\r\nof the vine-dressers, the laughter of girls.\r\n\r\nThe contrast is as great from the Indians of the Mojave Desert, two\r\ntypes of which are here given, to the vine-dressers of the Santa Ana\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nItaly is the land of the imagination, but the sensation on first\r\nbeholding it from the northern heights, aside from its associations of\r\nromance and poetry, can be repeated in our own land by whoever will\r\ncross the burning desert of Colorado, or the savage wastes of the Mojave\r\nwilderness of stone and sage-brush, and come suddenly, as he must come\r\nby train, into the bloom of Southern California. Let us study a little\r\nthe physical conditions.\r\n\r\nThe bay of San Diego is about three hundred miles east of San Francisco.\r\nThe coast line runs south-east, but at Point Conception it turns sharply\r\neast, and then curves south-easterly about two hundred and fifty miles\r\nto the Mexican coast boundary, the extreme south-west limits of the\r\nUnited States, a few miles below San Diego. This coast, defined by these\r\ntwo limits, has a southern exposure on the sunniest of oceans. Off this\r\ncoast, south of Point Conception, lies a chain of islands, curving in\r\nposition in conformity with the shore, at a distance of twenty to\r\nseventy miles from the main-land. These islands are San Miguel, Santa\r\nRosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina,\r\nSan Clemente, and Los Coronados, which lie in Mexican waters. Between\r\nthis chain of islands and the main-land is Santa Barbara Channel,\r\nflowing northward. The great ocean current from the north flows past\r\nPoint Conception like a mill-race, and makes a suction, or a sort of\r\neddy. It approaches nearer the coast in Lower California, where the\r\nreturn current, which is much warmer, flows northward and westward\r\nalong the curving shore. The Santa Barbara Channel, which may be called\r\nan arm of the Pacific, flows by many a bold point and lovely bay, like\r\nthose of San Pedro, Redondo, and Santa Monica; but it has no secure\r\nharbor, except the magnificent and unique bay of San Diego.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOJAVE DESERT.]\r\n\r\nThe southern and western boundary of Southern California is this mild\r\nPacific sea, studded with rocky and picturesque islands. The northern\r\nboundary of this region is ranges of lofty mountains, from five thousand\r\nto eleven thousand feet in height, some of them always snow-clad, which\r\nrun eastward from Point Conception nearly to the Colorado Desert. They\r\nare parts of the Sierra Nevada range, but they take various names,\r\nSanta Ynes, San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and they are spoken of all\r\ntogether as the Sierra Madre. In the San Gabriel group, \"Old Baldy\"\r\nlifts its snow-peak over nine thousand feet, while the San Bernardino\r\n\"Grayback\" rises over eleven thousand feet above the sea. Southward of\r\nthis, running down into San Diego County, is the San Jacinto range, also\r\nsnow-clad; and eastward the land falls rapidly away into the Salt Desert\r\nof the Colorado, in which is a depression about three hundred feet below\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Point Arguilles, which is above Point Conception, by the aid of the\r\noutlying islands, deflects the cold current from the north off the coast\r\nof Southern California, and the mountain ranges from Point Conception\r\neast divide the State of California into two climatic regions, the\r\nsouthern having more warmth, less rain and fog, milder winds, and less\r\nvariation of daily temperature than the climate of Central California to\r\nthe north.[A] Other striking climatic conditions are produced by the\r\ndaily interaction of the Pacific Ocean and the Colorado Desert,\r\ninfinitely diversified in minor particulars by the exceedingly broken\r\ncharacter of the region--a jumble of bare mountains, fruitful\r\nfoot-hills, and rich valleys. It would be only from a balloon that one\r\ncould get an adequate idea of this strange land.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: For these and other observations upon physical and climatic\r\nconditions I am wholly indebted to Dr. P. C. Remondino and Mr. T. S. Van\r\nDyke, of San Diego, both scientific and competent authorities.]\r\n\r\nThe United States has here, then, a unique corner of the earth, without\r\nits like in its own vast territory, and unparalleled, so far as I know,\r\nin the world. Shut off from sympathy with external conditions by the\r\ngiant mountain ranges and the desert wastes, it has its own climate\r\nunaffected by cosmic changes. Except a tidal wave from Japan, nothing\r\nwould seem to be able to affect or disturb it. The whole of Italy feels\r\nmore or less the climatic variations of the rest of Europe. All our\r\nAtlantic coast, all our interior basin from Texas to Manitoba, is in\r\nclimatic sympathy. Here is a region larger than New England which\r\nmanufactures its own weather and refuses to import any other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith considerable varieties of temperature according to elevation or\r\nprotection from the ocean breeze, its climate is nearly, on the whole,\r\nas agreeable as that of the Hawaiian Islands, though pitched in a lower\r\nkey, and with greater variations between day and night. The key to its\r\npeculiarity, aside from its southern exposure, is the Colorado Desert.\r\nThat desert, waterless and treeless, is cool at night and intolerably\r\nhot in the daytime, sending up a vast column of hot air, which cannot\r\nescape eastward, for Arizona manufactures a like column. It flows high\r\nabove the mountains westward till it strikes the Pacific and parts with\r\nits heat, creating an immense vacuum which is filled by the air from\r\nthe coast flowing up the slope and over the range, and plunging down\r\n6000 feet into the desert. \"It is easy to understand,\" says Mr. Van\r\nDyke, making his observations from the summit of the Cuyamaca, in San\r\nDiego County, 6500 feet above the sea-level, \"how land thus rising a\r\nmile or more in fifty or sixty miles, rising away from the coast, and\r\nfalling off abruptly a mile deep into the driest and hottest of American\r\ndeserts, could have a great variety of climates.... Only ten miles away\r\non the east the summers are the hottest, and only sixty miles on the\r\nwest the coolest known in the United States (except on this coast), and\r\nbetween them is every combination that mountains and valleys can\r\nproduce. And it is easy to see whence comes the sea-breeze, the glory of\r\nthe California summer. It is passing us here, a gentle breeze of six or\r\neight miles an hour. It is flowing over this great ridge directly into\r\nthe basin of the Colorado Desert, 6000 feet deep, where the temperature\r\nis probably 120°, and perhaps higher. For many leagues each side of us\r\nthis current is thus flowing at the same speed, and is probably half a\r\nmile or more in depth. About sundown, when the air on the desert cools\r\nand descends, the current will change and come the other way, and flood\r\nthese western slopes with an air as pure as that of the Sahara and\r\nnearly as dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF RIVERSIDE.]\r\n\r\n\"The air, heated on the western slopes by the sea, would by rising\r\nproduce considerable suction, which could be filled only from the sea,\r\nbut that alone would not make the sea-breeze as dry as it is. The\r\nprincipal suction is caused by the rising of heated air from the great\r\ndesert.... On the top of old Grayback (in San Bernardino) one can feel\r\nit [this breeze] setting westward, while in the cañons, 6000 feet below,\r\nit is blowing eastward.... All over Southern California the conditions\r\nof this breeze are about the same, the great Mojave Desert and the\r\nvalley of the San Joaquin above operating in the same way, assisted by\r\ninterior plains and slopes. Hence these deserts, that at first seem to\r\nbe a disadvantage to the land, are the great conditions of its climate,\r\nand are of far more value than if they were like the prairies of\r\nIllinois. Fortunately they will remain deserts forever. Some parts will\r\nin time be reclaimed by the waters of the Colorado River, but wet spots\r\nof a few hundred thousand acres would be too trifling to affect general\r\nresults, for millions of acres of burning desert would forever defy all\r\nattempts at irrigation or settlement.\"\r\n\r\nThis desert-born breeze explains a seeming anomaly in regard to the\r\nhumidity of this coast. I have noticed on the sea-shore that salt does\r\nnot become damp on the table, that the Portuguese fishermen on Point\r\nLoma are drying their fish on the shore, and that while the hydrometer\r\ngives a humidity as high as seventy-four, and higher at times, and fog\r\nmay prevail for three or four days continuously, the fog is rather\r\n\"dry,\" and the general impression is that of a dry instead of the damp\r\nand chilling atmosphere such as exists in foggy times on the Atlantic\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n\"From the study of the origin of this breeze we see,\" says Mr. Van Dyke,\r\n\"why it is that a wind coming from the broad Pacific should be drier\r\nthan the dry land-breezes of the Atlantic States, causing no damp walls,\r\nswelling doors, or rusting guns, and even on the coast drying up,\r\nwithout salt or soda, meat cut in strips an inch thick and fish much\r\nthicker.\"\r\n\r\nAt times on the coast the air contains plenty of moisture, but with the\r\nrising of this breeze the moisture decreases instead of increases. It\r\nshould be said also that this constantly returning current of air is\r\nalways pure, coming in contact nowhere with marshy or malarious\r\ninfluences nor any agency injurious to health. Its character causes the\r\nwhole coast from Santa Barbara to San Diego to be an agreeable place of\r\nresidence or resort summer and winter, while its daily inflowing tempers\r\nthe heat of the far inland valleys to a delightful atmosphere in the\r\nshade even in midsummer, while cool nights are everywhere the rule. The\r\ngreatest surprise of the traveller is that a region which is in\r\nperpetual bloom and fruitage, where semi-tropical fruits mature in\r\nperfection, and the most delicate flowers dazzle the eye with color the\r\nwinter through, should have on the whole a low temperature, a climate\r\nnever enervating, and one requiring a dress of woollen in every month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOUR CLIMATIC AND COMMERCIAL MEDITERRANEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter as we understand it east of the Rockies does not exist. I\r\nscarcely know how to divide the seasons. There are at most but three.\r\nSpring may be said to begin with December and end in April; summer, with\r\nMay (whose days, however, are often cooler than those of January), and\r\nend with September; while October and November are a mild autumn, when\r\nnature takes a partial rest, and the leaves of the deciduous trees are\r\ngone. But how shall we classify a climate in which the strawberry (none\r\nyet in my experience equal to the Eastern berry) may be eaten in every\r\nmonth of the year, and ripe figs may be picked from July to March? What\r\nshall I say of a frost (an affair of only an hour just before sunrise)\r\nwhich is hardly anywhere severe enough to disturb the delicate\r\nheliotrope, and even in the deepest valleys where it may chill the\r\norange, will respect the bloom of that fruit on contiguous ground fifty\r\nor a hundred feet higher? We boast about many things in the United\r\nStates, about our blizzards and our cyclones, our inundations and our\r\nareas of low pressure, our hottest and our coldest places in the world,\r\nbut what can we say for this little corner which is practically\r\nfrostless, and yet never had a sunstroke, knows nothing of\r\nthunder-storms and lightning, never experienced a cyclone, which is so\r\nwarm that the year round one is tempted to live out-of-doors, and so\r\ncold that woollen garments are never uncomfortable? Nature here, in this\r\nprotected and petted area, has the knack of being genial without being\r\nenervating, of being stimulating without \"bracing\" a person into the\r\ntomb. I think it conducive to equanimity of spirit and to longevity to\r\nsit in an orange grove and eat the fruit and inhale the fragrance of it\r\nwhile gazing upon a snow-mountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE IN SAN BERNARDINO.]\r\n\r\nThis southward-facing portion of California is irrigated by many streams\r\nof pure water rapidly falling from the mountains to the sea. The more\r\nimportant are the Santa Clara, the Los Angeles and San Gabriel, the\r\nSanta Ana, the Santa Margarita, the San Luis Rey, the San Bernardo, the\r\nSan Diego, and, on the Mexican border, the Tia Juana. Many of them go\r\ndry or flow underground in the summer months (or, as the Californians\r\nsay, the bed of the river gets on top), but most of them can be used for\r\nartificial irrigation. In the lowlands water is sufficiently near the\r\nsurface to moisten the soil, which is broken and cultivated; in most\r\nregions good wells are reached at a small depth, in others\r\nartesian-wells spout up abundance of water, and considerable portions of\r\nthe regions best known for fruit are watered by irrigating ditches and\r\npipes supplied by ample reservoirs in the mountains. From natural\r\nrainfall and the sea moisture the mesas and hills, which look arid\r\nbefore ploughing, produce large crops of grain when cultivated after the\r\nannual rains, without artificial watering.\r\n\r\nSouthern California has been slowly understood even by its occupants,\r\nwho have wearied the world with boasting of its productiveness.\r\nOriginally it was a vast cattle and sheep ranch. It was supposed that\r\nthe land was worthless except for grazing. Held in princely ranches of\r\ntwenty, fifty, one hundred thousand acres, in some cases areas larger\r\nthan German principalities, tens of thousands of cattle roamed along the\r\nwatercourses and over the mesas, vast flocks of sheep cropped close the\r\ngrass and trod the soil into hard-pan. The owners exchanged cattle and\r\nsheep for corn, grain, and garden vegetables; they had no faith that\r\nthey could grow cereals, and it was too much trouble to procure water\r\nfor a garden or a fruit orchard. It was the firm belief that most of the\r\nrolling mesa land was unfit for cultivation, and that neither forest nor\r\nfruit trees would grow without irrigation. Between Los Angeles and\r\nRedondo Beach is a ranch of 35,000 acres. Seventeen years ago it was\r\nowned by a Scotchman, who used the whole of it as a sheep ranch. In\r\nselling it to the present owner he warned him not to waste time by\r\nattempting to farm it; he himself raised no fruit or vegetables, planted\r\nno trees, and bought all his corn, wheat, and barley. The purchaser,\r\nhowever, began to experiment. He planted trees and set out orchards\r\nwhich grew, and in a couple of years he wrote to the former owner that\r\nhe had 8000 acres in fine wheat. To say it in a word, there is scarcely\r\nan acre of the tract which is not highly productive in barley, wheat,\r\ncorn, potatoes, while considerable parts of it are especially adapted to\r\nthe English walnut and to the citrus fruits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENES IN MONTECITO AND LOS ANGELES.]\r\n\r\nOn this route to the sea the road is lined with gardens. Nothing could\r\nbe more unpromising in appearance than this soil before it is ploughed\r\nand pulverized by the cultivator. It looks like a barren waste. We\r\npassed a tract that was offered three years ago for twelve dollars an\r\nacre. Some of it now is rented to Chinamen at thirty dollars an acre;\r\nand I saw one field of two acres off which a Chinaman has sold in one\r\nseason $750 worth of cabbages.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that almost all the land is wonderfully productive if\r\nintelligently handled. The low ground has water so near the surface that\r\nthe pulverized soil will draw up sufficient moisture for the crops; the\r\nmesa, if sown and cultivated after the annual rains, matures grain and\r\ncorn, and sustains vines and fruit-trees. It is singular that the first\r\nsettlers should never have discovered this productiveness. When it\r\nbecame apparent--that is, productiveness without artificial\r\nwatering--there spread abroad a notion that irrigation generally was not\r\nneeded. We shall have occasion to speak of this more in detail, and I\r\nwill now only say, on good authority, that while cultivation, not to\r\nkeep down the weeds only, but to keep the soil stirred and prevent its\r\nbaking, is the prime necessity for almost all land in Southern\r\nCalifornia, there are portions where irrigation is always necessary, and\r\nthere is no spot where the yield of fruit or grain will not be\r\nquadrupled by judicious irrigation. There are places where irrigation is\r\nexcessive and harmful both to the quality and quantity of oranges and\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\nThe history of the extension of cultivation in the last twenty and\r\nespecially in the past ten years from the foot-hills of the Sierra Madre\r\nin Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties southward to San Diego is\r\nvery curious. Experiments were timidly tried. Every acre of sand and\r\nsage-bush reclaimed southward was supposed to be the last capable of\r\nprofitable farming or fruit-growing. It is unsafe now to say of any land\r\nthat has not been tried that it is not good. In every valley and on\r\nevery hill-side, on the mesas and in the sunny nooks in the mountains,\r\nnearly anything will grow, and the application of water produces\r\nmarvellous results. From San Bernardino and Redlands, Riverside, Pomona,\r\nOntario, Santa Anita, San Gabriel, Pasadena, all the way to Los Angeles,\r\nis almost a continuous fruit garden, the green areas only emphasized by\r\nwastes yet unreclaimed; a land of charming cottages, thriving towns,\r\nhospitable to the fruit of every clime; a land of perpetual sun and\r\never-flowing breeze, looked down on by purple mountain ranges tipped\r\nhere and there with enduring snow. And what is in progress here will be\r\nseen before long in almost every part of this wonderful land, for\r\nconditions of soil and climate are essentially everywhere the same, and\r\ncapital is finding out how to store in and bring from the fastnesses of\r\nthe mountains rivers of clear water taken at such elevations that the\r\nwhole arable surface can be irrigated. The development of the country\r\nhas only just begun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAN-PALM, LOS ANGELES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YUCCA-PALM, SANTA BARBARA.]\r\n\r\nIf the reader will look upon the map of California he will see that the\r\neight counties that form Southern California--San Luis Obispo, Santa\r\nBarbara, Ventura, Kern, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, and San\r\nDiego--appear very mountainous. He will also notice that the eastern\r\nslopes of San Bernardino and San Diego are deserts. But this is an\r\nimmense area. San Diego County alone is as large as Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, and Rhode Island combined, and the amount of arable land in\r\nthe valleys, on the foot-hills, on the rolling mesas, is enormous, and\r\ncapable of sustaining a dense population, for its fertility and its\r\nyield to the acre under cultivation are incomparable. The reader will\r\nalso notice another thing. With the railroads now built and certain to\r\nbe built through all this diversified region, round from the Santa\r\nBarbara Mountains to the San Bernardino, the San Jacinto, and down to\r\nCuyamaca, a ride of an hour or two hours brings one to some point on the\r\n250 miles of sea-coast--a sea-coast genial, inviting in winter and\r\nsummer, never harsh, and rarely tempestuous like the Atlantic shore.\r\n\r\nHere is our Mediterranean! Here is our Italy! It is a Mediterranean\r\nwithout marshes and without malaria, and it does not at all resemble the\r\nMexican Gulf, which we have sometimes tried to fancy was like the\r\nclassic sea that laves Africa and Europe. Nor is this region Italian in\r\nappearance, though now and then some bay with its purple hills running\r\nto the blue sea, its surrounding mesas and cañons blooming in\r\nsemi-tropical luxuriance, some conjunction of shore and mountain, some\r\ngolden color, some white light and sharply defined shadows, some\r\nrefinement of lines, some poetic tints in violet and ashy ranges, some\r\nultramarine in the sea, or delicate blue in the sky, will remind the\r\ntraveller of more than one place of beauty in Southern Italy and Sicily.\r\nIt is a Mediterranean with a more equable climate, warmer winters and\r\ncooler summers, than the North Mediterranean shore can offer; it is an\r\nItaly whose mountains and valleys give almost every variety of elevation\r\nand temperature.\r\n\r\nBut it is our commercial Mediterranean. The time is not distant when\r\nthis corner of the United States will produce in abundance, and year\r\nafter year without failure, all the fruits and nuts which for a thousand\r\nyears the civilized world of Europe has looked to the Mediterranean to\r\nsupply. We shall not need any more to send over the Atlantic for\r\nraisins, English walnuts, almonds, figs, olives, prunes, oranges,\r\nlemons, limes, and a variety of other things which we know commercially\r\nas Mediterranean products. We have all this luxury and wealth at our\r\ndoors, within our limits. The orange and the lemon we shall still bring\r\nfrom many places; the date and the pineapple and the banana will never\r\ngrow here except as illustrations of the climate, but it is difficult to\r\nname any fruit of the temperate and semi-tropic zones that Southern\r\nCalifornia cannot be relied on to produce, from the guava to the peach.\r\n\r\nIt will need further experiment to determine what are the more\r\nprofitable products of this soil, and it will take longer experience to\r\ncultivate them and send them to market in perfection. The pomegranate\r\nand the apple thrive side by side, but the apple is not good here unless\r\nit is grown at an elevation where frost is certain and occasional snow\r\nmay be expected. There is no longer any doubt about the peach, the\r\nnectarine, the pear, the grape, the orange, the lemon, the apricot, and\r\nso on; but I believe that the greatest profit will be in the products\r\nthat cannot be grown elsewhere in the United States--the products to\r\nwhich we have long given the name of Mediterranean--the olive, the fig,\r\nthe raisin, the hard and soft shell almond, and the walnut. The orange\r\nwill of course be a staple, and constantly improve its reputation as\r\nbetter varieties are raised, and the right amount of irrigation to\r\nproduce the finest and sweetest is ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt is still a wonder that a land in which there was no indigenous\r\nproduct of value, or to which cultivation could give value, should be so\r\nhospitable to every sort of tree, shrub, root, grain, and flower that\r\ncan be brought here from any zone and temperature, and that many of\r\nthese foreigners to the soil grow here with a vigor and productiveness\r\nsurpassing those in their native land. This bewildering adaptability has\r\nmisled many into unprofitable experiments, and the very rapidity of\r\ngrowth has been a disadvantage. The land has been advertised by its\r\nmonstrous vegetable productions, which are not fit to eat, and but\r\ntestify to the fertility of the soil; and the reputation of its fruits,\r\nboth deciduous and citrus, has suffered by specimens sent to Eastern\r\nmarkets whose sole recommendation was size. Even in the vineyards and\r\norange orchards quality has been sacrificed to quantity. Nature here\r\nresponds generously to every encouragement, but it cannot be forced\r\nwithout taking its revenge in the return of inferior quality. It is just\r\nas true of Southern California as of any other land, that hard work and\r\nsagacity and experience are necessary to successful horticulture and\r\nagriculture, but it is undeniably true that the same amount of\r\nwell-directed industry upon a much smaller area of land will produce\r\nmore return than in almost any other section of the United States.\r\nSensible people do not any longer pay much attention to those tempting\r\nlittle arithmetical sums by which it is demonstrated that paying so much\r\nfor ten acres of barren land, and so much for planting it with vines or\r\noranges, the income in three years will be a competence to the investor\r\nand his family. People do not spend much time now in gaping over\r\nabnormal vegetables, or trying to convince themselves that wines of\r\nevery known variety and flavor can be produced within the limits of one\r\nflat and well-watered field. Few now expect to make a fortune by cutting\r\narid land up into twenty-feet lots, but notwithstanding the extravagance\r\nof recent speculation, the value of arable land has steadily\r\nappreciated, and is not likely to recede, for the return from it, either\r\nin fruits, vegetables, or grain, is demonstrated to be beyond the\r\nexperience of farming elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGNOLIA AVENUE, RIVERSIDE.]\r\n\r\nLand cannot be called dear at one hundred or one thousand dollars an\r\nacre if the annual return from it is fifty or five hundred dollars. The\r\nclimate is most agreeable the year through. There are no unpleasant\r\nmonths, and few unpleasant days. The eucalyptus grows so fast that the\r\ntrimmings from the trees of a small grove or highway avenue will in four\r\nor five years furnish a family with its firewood. The strong, fattening\r\nalfalfa gives three, four, five, and even six harvests a year. Nature\r\nneeds little rest, and, with the encouragement of water and fertilizers,\r\napparently none. But all this prodigality and easiness of life detracts\r\na little from ambition. The lesson has been slowly learned, but it is\r\nnow pretty well conned, that hard work is as necessary here as elsewhere\r\nto thrift and independence. The difference between this and many other\r\nparts of our land is that nature seems to work with a man, and not\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEARLY VICISSITUDES.--PRODUCTIONS.--SANITARY CLIMATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthern California has rapidly passed through varied experiences, and\r\nhas not yet had a fair chance to show the world what it is. It had its\r\nperiod of romance, of pastoral life, of lawless adventure, of crazy\r\nspeculation, all within a hundred years, and it is just now entering\r\nupon its period of solid, civilized development. A certain light of\r\nromance is cast upon this coast by the Spanish voyagers of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, but its history begins with the establishment of the chain of\r\nFranciscan missions, the first of which was founded by the great Father\r\nJunipero Serra at San Diego in 1769. The fathers brought with them the\r\nvine and the olive, reduced the savage Indians to industrial pursuits,\r\nand opened the way for that ranchero and adobe civilization which, down\r\nto the coming of the American, in about 1840, made in this region the\r\nmost picturesque life that our continent has ever seen. Following this\r\nis a period of desperado adventure and revolution, of pioneer\r\nState-building; and then the advent of the restless, the cranky, the\r\ninvalid, the fanatic, from every other State in the Union. The first\r\nexperimenters in making homes seem to have fancied that they had come to\r\na ready-made elysium--the idle man's heaven. They seem to have brought\r\nwith them little knowledge of agriculture or horticulture, were ignorant\r\nof the conditions of success in this soil and climate, and left behind\r\nthe good industrial maxims of the East. The result was a period of\r\nchance experiment, one in which extravagant expectation and boasting to\r\nsome extent took the place of industry. The imagination was heated by\r\nthe novelty of such varied and rapid productiveness. Men's minds were\r\ninflamed by the apparently limitless possibilities. The invalid and the\r\nspeculator thronged the transcontinental roads leading thither. In this\r\ncondition the frenzy of 1886-87 was inevitable. I saw something of it in\r\nthe winter of 1887. The scenes then daily and commonplace now read like\r\nthe wildest freaks of the imagination.\r\n\r\nThe bubble collapsed as suddenly as it expanded. Many were ruined, and\r\nleft the country. More were merely ruined in their great expectations.\r\nThe speculation was in town lots. When it subsided it left the climate\r\nas it was, the fertility as it was, and the value of arable land not\r\nreduced. Marvellous as the boom was, I think the present recuperation is\r\nstill more wonderful. In 1890, to be sure, I miss the bustle of the\r\ncities, and the creation of towns in a week under the hammer of the\r\nauctioneer. But in all the cities, and most of the villages, there has\r\nbeen growth in substantial buildings, and in the necessities of civic\r\nlife--good sewerage, water supply, and general organization; while the\r\ncountry, as the acreage of vines and oranges, wheat and barley, grain\r\nand corn, and the shipments by rail testify, has improved more than at\r\nany other period, and commerce is beginning to feel the impulse of a\r\ngenuine prosperity, based upon the intelligent cultivation of the\r\nground. School-houses have multiplied; libraries have been founded; many\r\n\"boom\" hotels, built in order to sell city lots in the sage-brush, have\r\nbeen turned into schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nThere is immense rivalry between different sections. Every Californian\r\nthinks that the spot where his house stands enjoys the best climate and\r\nis the most fertile in the world; and while you are with him you think\r\nhe is justified in his opinion; for this rivalry is generally a\r\nwholesome one, backed by industry. I do not mean to say that the habit\r\nof tall talk is altogether lost. Whatever one sees he is asked to\r\nbelieve is the largest and best in the world. The gentleman of the whip\r\nwho showed us some of the finest places in Los Angeles--places that in\r\ntheir wealth of flowers and semi-tropical gardens would rouse the\r\nenthusiasm of the most jaded traveller--was asked whether there were any\r\nfiner in the city. \"Finer? Hundreds of them;\" and then, meditatively and\r\nregretfully, \"I should not dare to show you the best.\" The\r\nsemi-ecclesiastical custodian of the old adobe mission of San Gabriel\r\nexplained to us the twenty portraits of apostles on the walls, all done\r\nby Murillo. As they had got out of repair, he had them all repainted by\r\nthe best artist. \"That one,\" he said, simply, \"cost ten dollars. It\r\noften costs more to repaint a picture than to buy an original.\"\r\n\r\nThe temporary evils in the train of the \"boom\" are fast disappearing. I\r\nwas told that I should find the country stagnant. Trade, it is true, is\r\nonly slowly coming in, real-estate deals are sleeping, but in all\r\navenues of solid prosperity and productiveness the country is the\r\nreverse of stagnant. Another misapprehension this visit is correcting. I\r\nwas told not to visit Southern California at this season on account of\r\nthe heat. But I have no experience of a more delightful summer climate\r\nthan this, especially on or near the coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AVENUE LOS ANGELES.]\r\n\r\nIn secluded valleys in the interior the thermometer rises in the daytime\r\nto 85°, 90°, and occasionally 100°, but I have found no place in them\r\nwhere there was not daily a refreshing breeze from the ocean, where the\r\ndryness of the air did not make the heat seem much less than it was, and\r\nwhere the nights were not agreeably cool. My belief is that the summer\r\nclimate of Southern California is as desirable for pleasure-seekers, for\r\ninvalids, for workmen, as its winter climate. It seems to me that a\r\ncoast temperature 60° to 75°, stimulating, without harshness or\r\ndampness, is about the perfection of summer weather. It should be said,\r\nhowever, that there are secluded valleys which become very hot in the\r\ndaytime in midsummer, and intolerably dusty. The dust is the great\r\nannoyance everywhere. It gives the whole landscape an ashy tint, like\r\nsome of our Eastern fields and way-sides in a dry August. The verdure\r\nand the wild flowers of the rainy season disappear entirely. There is,\r\nhowever, some picturesque compensation for this dust and lack of green.\r\nThe mountains and hills and great plains take on wonderful hues of\r\nbrown, yellow, and red.\r\n\r\nI write this paragraph in a high chamber in the Hotel del Coronado, on\r\nthe great and fertile beach in front of San Diego. It is the 2d of June.\r\nLooking southward, I see the great expanse of the Pacific Ocean,\r\nsparkling in the sun as blue as the waters at Amalfi. A low surf beats\r\nalong the miles and miles of white sand continually, with the impetus of\r\nfar-off seas and trade-winds, as it has beaten for thousands of years,\r\nwith one unending roar and swish, and occasional shocks of sound as if\r\nof distant thunder on the shore. Yonder, to the right, Point Loma\r\nstretches its sharp and rocky promontory into the ocean, purple in the\r\nsun, bearing a light-house on its highest elevation. From this signal,\r\nbending in a perfect crescent, with a silver rim, the shore sweeps\r\naround twenty-five miles to another promontory running down beyond Tia\r\nJuana to the Point of Rocks, in Mexican territory. Directly in\r\nfront--they say eighteen miles away, I think five sometimes, and\r\nsometimes a hundred--lie the islands of Coronado, named, I suppose, from\r\nthe old Spanish adventurer Vasques de Coronado, huge bulks of beautiful\r\nred sandstone, uninhabited and barren, becalmed there in the changing\r\nblue of sky and sea, like enormous mastless galleons, like degraded\r\nicebergs, like Capri and Ischia. They say that they are stationary. I\r\nonly know that when I walk along the shore towards Point Loma they seem\r\nto follow, until they lie opposite the harbor entrance, which is close\r\nby the promontory; and that when I return, they recede and go away\r\ntowards Mexico, to which they belong. Sometimes, as seen from the beach,\r\nowing to the difference in the humidity of the strata of air over the\r\nocean, they seem smaller at the bottom than at the top. Occasionally\r\nthey come quite near, as do the sea-lions and the gulls, and again they\r\nalmost fade out of the horizon in a violet light. This morning they\r\nstand away, and the fleet of white-sailed fishing-boats from the\r\nPortuguese hamlet of La Playa, within the harbor entrance, which is\r\ndancing off Point Loma, will have a long sail if they pursue the\r\nbarracuda to those shadowy rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE GARDEN AT SANTA BARBARA MISSION.]\r\n\r\nWe crossed the bay the other day, and drove up a wild road to the height\r\nof the promontory, and along its narrow ridge to the light-house. This\r\nsite commands one of the most remarkable views in the accessible\r\ncivilized world, one of the three or four really great prospects which\r\nthe traveller can recall, astonishing in its immensity, interesting in\r\nits peculiar details. The general features are the great ocean, blue,\r\nflecked with sparkling, breaking wavelets, and the wide, curving\r\ncoast-line, rising into mesas, foot-hills, ranges on ranges of\r\nmountains, the faintly seen snow-peaks of San Bernardino and San Jacinto\r\nto the Cuyamaca and the flat top of Table Mountain in Mexico. Directly\r\nunder us on one side are the fields of kelp, where the whales come to\r\nfeed in winter; and on the other is a point of sand on Coronado Beach,\r\nwhere a flock of pelicans have assembled after their day's fishing, in\r\nwhich occupation they are the rivals of the Portuguese. The perfect\r\ncrescent of the ocean beach is seen, the singular formation of North and\r\nSouth Coronado Beach, the entrance to the harbor along Point Loma, and\r\nthe spacious inner bay, on which lie San Diego and National City, with\r\nlowlands and heights outside sprinkled with houses, gardens, orchards,\r\nand vineyards. The near hills about this harbor are varied in form and\r\npoetic in color, one of them, the conical San Miguel, constantly\r\nrecalling Vesuvius. Indeed, the near view, in color, vegetation, and\r\nforms of hills and extent of arable land, suggests that of Naples,\r\nthough on analysis it does not resemble it. If San Diego had half a\r\nmillion of people it would be more like it; but the Naples view is\r\nlimited, while this stretches away to the great mountains that overlook\r\nthe Colorado Desert. It is certainly one of the loveliest prospects in\r\nthe world, and worth long travel to see.\r\n\r\nStanding upon this point of view, I am reminded again of the striking\r\ncontrasts and contiguous different climates on the coast. In the north,\r\nof course not visible from here, is Mount Whitney, on the borders of\r\nInyo County and of the State of Nevada, 15,086 feet above the sea, the\r\nhighest peak in the United States, excluding Alaska. South of it is\r\nGrayback, in the San Bernardino range, 11,000 feet in altitude, the\r\nhighest point above its base in the United States. While south of that\r\nis the depression in the Colorado Desert in San Diego County, about\r\nthree hundred feet below the level of the Pacific Ocean, the lowest land\r\nin the United States. These three exceptional points can be said to be\r\nalmost in sight of each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE AT PASADENA.]\r\n\r\nI have insisted so much upon the Mediterranean character of this region\r\nthat it is necessary to emphasize the contrasts also. Reserving details\r\nand comments on different localities as to the commercial value of\r\nproducts and climatic conditions, I will make some general observations.\r\nI am convinced that the fig can not only be grown here in sufficient\r\nquantity to supply our markets, but of the best quality. The same may be\r\nsaid of the English walnut. This clean and handsome tree thrives\r\nwonderfully in large areas, and has no enemies. The olive culture is in\r\nits infancy, but I have never tasted better oil than that produced at\r\nSanta Barbara and on San Diego Bay. Specimens of the pickled olive are\r\ndelicious, and when the best varieties are generally grown, and the best\r\nmethod of curing is adopted, it will be in great demand, not as a mere\r\nrelish, but as food. The raisin is produced in all the valleys of\r\nSouthern California, and in great quantities in the hot valley of San\r\nJoaquin, beyond the Sierra Madre range. The best Malaga raisins, which\r\nhave the reputation of being the best in the world, may never come to\r\nour market, but I have never eaten a better raisin for size, flavor, and\r\nthinness of skin than those raised in the El Cajon Valley, which is\r\nwatered by the great flume which taps a reservoir in the Cuyamaca\r\nMountains, and supplies San Diego. But the quality of the raisin in\r\nCalifornia will be improved by experience in cultivation and handling.\r\n\r\nThe contrast with the Mediterranean region--I refer to the western\r\nbasin--is in climate. There is hardly any point along the French and\r\nItalian coast that is not subject to great and sudden changes, caused by\r\nthe north wind, which has many names, or in the extreme southern\r\npeninsula and islands by the sirocco. There are few points that are not\r\nreached by malaria, and in many resorts--and some of them most sunny and\r\nagreeable to the invalid--the deadliest fevers always lie in wait. There\r\nis great contrast between summer and winter, and exceeding variability\r\nin the same month. This variability is the parent of many diseases of\r\nthe lungs, the bowels, and the liver. It is demonstrated now by\r\nlong-continued observations that dampness and cold are not so inimical\r\nto health as variability.\r\n\r\nThe Southern California climate is an anomaly. It has been the subject\r\nof a good deal of wonder and a good deal of boasting, but it is worthy\r\nof more scientific study than it has yet received. Its distinguishing\r\nfeature I take to be its equability. The temperature the year through is\r\nlower than I had supposed, and the contrast is not great between the\r\nsummer and the winter months. The same clothing is appropriate, speaking\r\ngenerally, for the whole year. In all seasons, including the rainy days\r\nof the winter months, sunshine is the rule. The variation of temperature\r\nbetween day and night is considerable, but if the new-comer exercises a\r\nlittle care, he will not be unpleasantly affected by it. There are coast\r\nfogs, but these are not chilling and raw. Why it is that with the\r\nhydrometer showing a considerable humidity in the air the general effect\r\nof the climate is that of dryness, scientists must explain. The constant\r\nexchange of desert airs with the ocean air may account for the anomaly,\r\nand the actual dryness of the soil, even on the coast, is put forward as\r\nanother explanation. Those who come from heated rooms on the Atlantic\r\nmay find the winters cooler than they expect, and those used to the\r\nheated terms of the Mississippi Valley and the East will be surprised at\r\nthe cool and salubrious summers. A land without high winds or\r\nthunder-storms may fairly be said to have a unique climate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIVE-OAK NEAR LOS ANGELES.]\r\n\r\nI suppose it is the equability and not conditions of dampness or dryness\r\nthat renders this region so remarkably exempt from epidemics and endemic\r\ndiseases. The diseases of children prevalent elsewhere are unknown here;\r\nthey cut their teeth without risk, and _cholera infantum_ never visits\r\nthem. Diseases of the bowels are practically unknown. There is no\r\nmalaria, whatever that may be, and consequently an absence of those\r\nvarious fevers and other disorders which are attributed to malarial\r\nconditions. Renal diseases are also wanting; disorders of the liver and\r\nkidneys, and Bright's disease, gout, and rheumatism, are not native. The\r\nclimate in its effect is stimulating, but at the same time soothing to\r\nthe nerves, so that if \"nervous prostration\" is wanted, it must be\r\nbrought here, and cannot be relied on to continue long. These facts are\r\nderived from medical practice with the native Indian and Mexican\r\npopulation. Dr. Remondino, to whom I have before referred, has made the\r\nsubject a study for eighteen years, and later I shall offer some of the\r\nresults of his observations upon longevity. It is beyond my province to\r\nventure any suggestion upon the effect of the climate upon deep-seated\r\ndiseases, especially of the respiratory organs, of invalids who come\r\nhere for health. I only know that we meet daily and constantly so many\r\npersons in fair health who say that it is impossible for them to live\r\nelsewhere that the impression is produced that a considerable proportion\r\nof the immigrant population was invalid. There are, however, two\r\nsuggestions that should be made. Care is needed in acclimation to a\r\nclimate that differs from any previous experience; and the locality that\r\nwill suit any invalid can only be determined by personal experience. If\r\nthe coast does not suit him, he may be benefited in a protected valley,\r\nor he may be improved on the foot-hills, or on an elevated mesa, or on a\r\nhigh mountain elevation.\r\n\r\nOne thing may be regarded as settled. Whatever the sensibility or the\r\npeculiarity of invalidism, the equable climate is exceedingly favorable\r\nto the smooth working of the great organic functions of respiration,\r\ndigestion, and circulation.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity to give this chapter a medical tone. One need not be an\r\ninvalid to come here and appreciate the graciousness of the air; the\r\ncolor of the landscape, which is wanting in our Northern clime; the\r\nconstant procession of flowers the year through; the purple hills\r\nstretching into the sea; the hundreds of hamlets, with picturesque homes\r\novergrown with roses and geranium and heliotrope, in the midst of orange\r\norchards and of palms and magnolias, in sight of the snow-peaks of the\r\ngiant mountain ranges which shut in this land of marvellous beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER OF OUR CONTENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia is the land of the Pine and the Palm. The tree of the\r\nSierras, native, vigorous, gigantic, and the tree of the Desert, exotic,\r\nsupple, poetic, both flourish within the nine degrees of latitude. These\r\ntwo, the widely separated lovers of Heine's song, symbolize the\r\ncapacities of the State, and although the sugar-pine is indigenous, and\r\nthe date-palm, which will never be more than an ornament in this\r\nhospitable soil, was planted by the Franciscan Fathers, who established\r\na chain of missions from San Diego to Monterey over a century ago, they\r\nshould both be the distinction of one commonwealth, which, in its seven\r\nhundred miles of indented sea-coast, can boast the climates of all\r\ncountries and the products of all zones.\r\n\r\nIf this State of mountains and valleys were divided by an east and west\r\nline, following the general course of the Sierra Madre range, and\r\ncutting off the eight lower counties, I suppose there would be conceit\r\nenough in either section to maintain that it only is the Paradise of the\r\nearth, but both are necessary to make the unique and contradictory\r\nCalifornia which fascinates and bewilders the traveller. He is told that\r\nthe inhabitants of San Francisco go away from the draught of the Golden\r\nGate in the summer to get warm, and yet the earliest luscious cherries\r\nand apricots which he finds in the far south market of San Diego come\r\nfrom the Northern Santa Clara Valley. The truth would seem to be that in\r\nan hour's ride in any part of the State one can change his climate\r\ntotally at any time of the year, and this not merely by changing his\r\nelevation, but by getting in or out of the range of the sea or the\r\ndesert currents of air which follow the valleys.\r\n\r\nTo recommend to any one a winter climate is far from the writer's\r\nthought. No two persons agree on what is desirable for a winter\r\nresidence, and the inclination of the same person varies with his state\r\nof health. I can only attempt to give some idea of what is called the\r\nwinter months in Southern California, to which my observations mainly\r\napply. The individual who comes here under the mistaken notion that\r\nclimate ever does anything more than give nature a better chance, may\r\nspeedily or more tardily need the service of an undertaker; and the\r\ninvalid whose powers are responsive to kindly influences may live so\r\nlong, being unable to get away, that life will be a burden to him. The\r\nperson in ordinary health will find very little that is hostile to the\r\norderly organic processes. In order to appreciate the winter climate of\r\nSouthern California one should stay here the year through, and select\r\nthe days that suit his idea of winter from any of the months. From the\r\nfact that the greatest humidity is in the summer and the least in the\r\nwinter months, he may wear an overcoat in July in a temperature,\r\naccording to the thermometer, which in January would render the overcoat\r\nunnecessary. It is dampness that causes both cold and heat to be most\r\nfelt. The lowest temperatures, in Southern California generally, are\r\ncaused only by the extreme dryness of the air; in the long nights of\r\nDecember and January there is a more rapid and longer continued\r\nradiation of heat. It must be a dry and clear night that will send the\r\ntemperature down to thirty-four degrees. But the effect of the sun upon\r\nthis air is instantaneous, and the cold morning is followed at once by a\r\nwarm forenoon; the difference between the average heat of July and the\r\naverage cold of January, measured by the thermometer, is not great in\r\nthe valleys, foot-hills, and on the coast. Five points give this result\r\nof average for January and July respectively: Santa Barbara, 52°, 66°;\r\nSan Bernardino, 51°, 70°; Pomona, 52°, 68°; Los Angeles, 52°, 67°; San\r\nDiego, 53°, 66°. The day in the winter months is warmer in the interior\r\nand the nights are cooler than on the coast, as shown by the following\r\nfigures for January: 7 A.M., Los Angeles, 46.5°; San Diego, 47.5°; 3\r\nP.M., Los Angeles, 65.2°; San Diego, 60.9°. In the summer the difference\r\nis greater. In June I saw the thermometer reach 103° in Los Angeles when\r\nit was only 79° in San Diego. But I have seen the weather unendurable in\r\nNew York with a temperature of 85°, while this dry heat of 103° was not\r\noppressive. The extraordinary equanimity of the coast climate (certainly\r\nthe driest marine climate in my experience) will be evident from the\r\naverage mean for each month, from records of sixteen years, ending in\r\n1877, taken at San Diego, giving each month in order, beginning with\r\nJanuary: 53.5°, 54.7°, 56.0°, 58.2°, 60.2°, 64.6°, 67.1°, 69.0°, 66.7°,\r\n62.9°, 58.1°, 56.0°. In the year 1877 the mean temperature at 3 P.M. at\r\nSan Diego was as follows, beginning with January: 60.9°, 57.7°, 62.4°,\r\n63.3°, 66.3°, 68.5°, 69.6°, 69.6°, 69.5°, 69.6°, 64.4°, 60.5°. For the\r\nfour months of July, August, September, and October there was hardly a\r\nshade of difference at 3 P.M. The striking fact in all the records I\r\nhave seen is that the difference of temperature in the daytime between\r\nsummer and winter is very small, the great difference being from\r\nmidnight to just before sunrise, and this latter difference is greater\r\ninland than on the coast. There are, of course, frost and ice in the\r\nmountains, but the frost that comes occasionally in the low inland\r\nvalleys is of very brief duration in the morning hour, and rarely\r\ncontinues long enough to have a serious effect upon vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn considering the matter of temperature, the rule for vegetation and\r\nfor invalids will not be the same. A spot in which delicate flowers in\r\nSouthern California bloom the year round may be too cool for many\r\ninvalids. It must not be forgotten that the general temperature here is\r\nlower than that to which most Eastern people are accustomed. They are\r\nused to living all winter in overheated houses, and to protracted heated\r\nterms rendered worse by humidity in the summer. The dry, low temperature\r\nof the California winter, notwithstanding its perpetual sunshine, may\r\nseem, therefore, wanting to them in direct warmth. It may take a year or\r\ntwo to acclimate them to this more equable and more refreshing\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nNeither on the coast nor in the foot-hills will the invalid find the\r\nclimate of the Riviera or of Tangier--not the tramontane wind of the\r\nformer, nor the absolutely genial but somewhat enervating climate of\r\nthe latter. But it must be borne in mind that in this, our\r\nMediterranean, the seeker for health or pleasure can find almost any\r\nclimate (except the very cold or the very hot), down to the minutest\r\nsubdivision. He may try the dry marine climate of the coast, or the\r\ntemperature of the fruit lands and gardens from San Bernardino to Los\r\nAngeles, or he may climb to any altitude that suits him in the Sierra\r\nMadre or the San Jacinto ranges. The difference may be all-important to\r\nhim between a valley and a mesa which is not a hundred feet higher; nay,\r\nbetween a valley and the slope of a foot-hill, with a shifting of not\r\nmore than fifty feet elevation, the change may be as marked for him as\r\nit is for the most sensitive young fruit-tree. It is undeniable,\r\nnotwithstanding these encouraging \"averages,\" that cold snaps, though\r\nrare, do come occasionally, just as in summer there will occur one or\r\ntwo or three continued days of intense heat. And in the summer in some\r\nlocalities--it happened in June, 1890, in the Santiago hills in Orange\r\nCounty--the desert sirocco, blowing over the Colorado furnace, makes\r\nlife just about unendurable for days at a time. Yet with this dry heat\r\nsunstroke is never experienced, and the diseases of the bowels usually\r\naccompanying hot weather elsewhere are unknown. The experienced\r\ntraveller who encounters unpleasant weather, heat that he does not\r\nexpect, cold that he did not provide for, or dust that deprives him of\r\nhis last atom of good-humor, and is told that it is \"exceptional,\" knows\r\nexactly what that word means. He is familiar with the \"exceptional\" the\r\nworld over, and he feels a sort of compassion for the inhabitants who\r\nhave not yet learned the adage, \"Good wine needs no bush.\" Even those\r\nwho have bought more land than they can pay for can afford to tell the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season in Southern California, which may open with a shower or\r\ntwo in October, but does not set in till late in November, or till\r\nDecember, and is over in April, is not at all a period of cloudy weather\r\nor continuous rainfall. On the contrary, bright warm days and brilliant\r\nsunshine are the rule. The rain is most likely to fall in the night.\r\nThere may be a day of rain, or several days that are overcast with\r\ndistributed rain, but the showers are soon over, and the sky clears. Yet\r\nwinters vary greatly in this respect, the rainfall being much greater in\r\nsome than in others. In 1890 there was rain beyond the average, and even\r\non the equable beach of Coronada there were some weeks of weather that\r\nfrom the California point of view were very unpleasant. It was\r\nunpleasant by local comparison, but it was not damp and chilly, like a\r\nprotracted period of falling weather on the Atlantic. The rain comes\r\nwith a southerly wind, caused by a disturbance far north, and with the\r\nresumption of the prevailing westerly winds it suddenly ceases, the air\r\nclears, and neither before nor after it is the atmosphere \"steamy\" or\r\nenervating. The average annual rainfall of the Pacific coast diminishes\r\nby regular gradation from point to point all the way from Puget Sound to\r\nthe Mexican boundary. At Neah Bay it is 111 inches, and it steadily\r\nlessens down to Santa Cruz, 25.24; Monterey, 11.42; Point Conception,\r\n12.21; San Diego, 11.01. There is fog on the coast in every month, but\r\nthis diminishes, like the rainfall, from north to south. I have\r\nencountered it in both February and June. In the south it is apt to be\r\nmost persistent in April and May, when for three or four days together\r\nthere will be a fine mist, which any one but a Scotchman would call\r\nrain. Usually, however, the fog-bank will roll in during the night, and\r\ndisappear by ten o'clock in the morning. There is no wet season properly\r\nso called, and consequently few days in the winter months when it is not\r\nagreeable to be out-of-doors, perhaps no day when one may not walk or\r\ndrive during some part of it. Yet as to precipitation or temperature it\r\nis impossible to strike any general average for Southern California. In\r\n1883-84 San Diego had 25.77 inches of rain, and Los Angeles (fifteen\r\nmiles inland) had 38.22. The annual average at Los Angeles is 17.64; but\r\nin 1876-77 the total at San Diego was only 3.75, and at Los Angeles only\r\n5.28. Yet elevation and distance from the coast do not always determine\r\nthe rainfall. The yearly mean rainfall at Julian, in the San Jacinto\r\nrange, at an elevation of 4500 feet, is 37.74; observations at\r\nRiverside, 1050 feet above the sea, give an average of 9.37.\r\n\r\nIt is probably impossible to give an Eastern man a just idea of the\r\nwinter of Southern California. Accustomed to extremes, he may expect too\r\nmuch. He wants a violent change. If he quits the snow, the slush, the\r\nleaden skies, the alternate sleet and cold rain of New England, he would\r\nlike the tropical heat, the languor, the color of Martinique. He will\r\nnot find them here. He comes instead into a strictly temperate region;\r\nand even when he arrives, his eyes deceive him. He sees the orange\r\nripening in its dark foliage, the long lines of the eucalyptus, the\r\nfeathery pepper-tree, the magnolia, the English walnut, the black\r\nlive-oak, the fan-palm, in all the vigor of June; everywhere beds of\r\nflowers of every hue and of every country blazing in the bright\r\nsunlight--the heliotrope, the geranium, the rare hot-house roses\r\noverrunning the hedges of cypress, and the scarlet passion-vine climbing\r\nto the roof-tree of the cottages; in the vineyard or the orchard the\r\nhorticulturist is following the cultivator in his shirt-sleeves; he\r\nhears running water, the song of birds, the scent of flowers is in the\r\nair, and he cannot understand why he needs winter clothing, why he is\r\nalways seeking the sun, why he wants a fire at night. It is a fraud, he\r\nsays, all this visible display of summer, and of an almost tropical\r\nsummer at that; it is really a cold country. It is incongruous that he\r\nshould be looking at a date-palm in his overcoat, and he is puzzled that\r\na thermometrical heat that should enervate him elsewhere, stimulates him\r\nhere. The green, brilliant, vigorous vegetation, the perpetual sunshine,\r\ndeceive him; he is careless about the difference of shade and sun, he\r\ngets into a draught, and takes cold. Accustomed to extremes of\r\ntemperature and artificial heat, I think for most people the first\r\nwinter here is a disappointment. I was told by a physician who had\r\neighteen years' experience of the climate that in his first winter he\r\nthought he had never seen a people so insensitive to cold as the San\r\nDiegans, who seemed not to require warmth. And all this time the trees\r\nare growing like asparagus, the most delicate flowers are in perpetual\r\nbloom, the annual crops are most lusty. I fancy that the soil is always\r\nwarm. The temperature is truly moderate. The records for a number of\r\nyears show that the mid-day temperature of clear days in winter is from\r\n60° to 70° on the coast, from 65° to 80° in the interior, while that of\r\nrainy days is about 60° by the sea and inland. Mr. Van Dyke says that\r\nthe lowest mid-day temperature recorded at the United States signal\r\nstation at San Diego during eight years is 51°. This occurred but once.\r\nIn those eight years there were but twenty-one days when the mid-day\r\ntemperature was not above 55°. In all that time there were but six days\r\nwhen the mercury fell below 36° at any time in the night; and but two\r\nwhen it fell to 32°, the lowest point ever reached there. On one of\r\nthese two last-named days it went to 51° at noon, and on the other to\r\n56°. This was the great \"cold snap\" of December, 1879.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that this sort of climate would suit any one in\r\nordinary health, inviting and stimulating to constant out-of-door\r\nexercise, and that it would be equally favorable to that general\r\nbreakdown of the system which has the name of nervous prostration. The\r\neffect upon diseases of the respiratory organs can only be determined by\r\nindividual experience. The government has lately been sending soldiers\r\nwho have consumption from various stations in the United States to San\r\nDiego for treatment. This experiment will furnish interesting data.\r\nWithin a period covering a little over two years, Dr. Huntington, the\r\npost surgeon, has had fifteen cases sent to him. Three of these patients\r\nhad tubercular consumption; twelve had consumption induced by attacks of\r\npneumonia. One of the tubercular patients died within a month after his\r\narrival; the second lived eight months; the third was discharged cured,\r\nleft the army, and contracted malaria elsewhere, of which he died. The\r\nremaining twelve were discharged practically cured of consumption, but\r\ntwo of them subsequently died. It is exceedingly common to meet persons\r\nof all ages and both sexes in Southern California who came invalided by\r\ndisease of the lungs or throat, who have every promise of fair health\r\nhere, but who dare not leave this climate. The testimony is convincing\r\nof the good effect of the climate upon all children, upon women\r\ngenerally, and of its rejuvenating effect upon men and women of advanced\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHEALTH AND LONGEVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the effect of climate upon health and longevity, Dr.\r\nRemondino quotes old Hufeland that \"uniformity in the state of the\r\natmosphere, particularly in regard to heat, cold, gravity, and\r\nlightness, contributes in a very considerable degree to the duration of\r\nlife. Countries, therefore, where great and sudden varieties in the\r\nbarometer and the thermometer are usual cannot be favorable to\r\nlongevity. Such countries may be healthy, and many men may become old in\r\nthem, but they will not attain to a great age, for all rapid variations\r\nare so many internal mutations, and these occasion an astonishing\r\nconsumption both of the forces and the organs.\" Hufeland thought a\r\nmarine climate most favorable to longevity. He describes, and perhaps we\r\nmay say prophesied, a region he had never known, where the conditions\r\nand combinations were most favorable to old age, which is epitomized by\r\nDr. Remondino: \"where the latitude gives warmth and the sea or ocean\r\ntempering winds, where the soil is warm and dry and the sun is also\r\nbright and warm, where uninterrupted bright clear weather and a moderate\r\ntemperature are the rule, where extremes neither of heat nor cold are to\r\nbe found, where nothing may interfere with the exercise of the aged, and\r\nwhere the actual results and cases of longevity will bear testimony as\r\nto the efficacy of all its climatic conditions being favorable to a long\r\nand comfortable existence.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIDWINTER, PASADENA.]\r\n\r\nIn an unpublished paper Dr. Remondino comments on the extraordinary\r\nendurance of animals and men in the California climate, and cites many\r\ncases of uncommon longevity in natives. In reading the accounts of early\r\ndays in California I am struck with the endurance of hardship, exposure,\r\nand wounds by the natives and the adventurers, the rancheros, horsemen,\r\nherdsmen, the descendants of soldiers and the Indians, their\r\ninsensibility to fatigue, and their agility and strength. This is\r\nascribed to the climate; and what is true of man is true of the native\r\nhorse. His only rival in strength, endurance, speed, and intelligence is\r\nthe Arabian. It was long supposed that this was racial, and that but for\r\nthe smallness of the size of the native horse, crossing with it would\r\nimprove the breed of the Eastern and Kentucky racers. But there was\r\nreluctance to cross the finely proportioned Eastern horse with his\r\ndiminutive Western brother. The importation and breeding of\r\nthoroughbreds on this coast has led to the discovery that the desirable\r\nqualities of the California horse were not racial but climatic. The\r\nEastern horse has been found to improve in size, compactness of muscle,\r\nin strength of limb, in wind, with a marked increase in power of\r\nendurance. The traveller here notices the fine horses and their\r\nexcellent condition, and the power and endurance of those that have\r\nconsiderable age. The records made on Eastern race-courses by horses\r\nfrom California breeding farms have already attracted attention. It is\r\nalso remarked that the Eastern horse is usually improved greatly by a\r\nsojourn of a season or two on this coast, and the plan of bringing\r\nEastern race-horses here for the winter is already adopted.\r\n\r\nMan, it is asserted by our authority, is as much benefited as the horse\r\nby a change to this climate. The new-comer may have certain unpleasant\r\nsensations in coming here from different altitudes and conditions, but\r\nhe will soon be conscious of better being, of increased power in all the\r\nfunctions of life, more natural and recuperative sleep, and an accession\r\nof vitality and endurance. Dr. Remondino also testifies that it\r\noccasionally happens in this rejuvenation that families which have\r\nseemed to have reached their limit at the East are increased after\r\nresidence here.\r\n\r\nThe early inhabitants of Southern California, according to the statement\r\nof Mr. H. H. Bancroft and other reports, were found to be living in\r\nSpartan conditions as to temperance and training, and in a highly moral\r\ncondition, in consequence of which they had uncommon physical endurance\r\nand contempt for luxury. This training in abstinence and hardship, with\r\ntemperance in diet, combined with the climate to produce the astonishing\r\nlongevity to be found here. Contrary to the customs of most other tribes\r\nof Indians, their aged were the care of the community. Dr. W. A. Winder,\r\nof San Diego, is quoted as saying that in a visit to El Cajon Valley\r\nsome thirty years ago he was taken to a house in which the aged persons\r\nwere cared for. There were half a dozen who had reached an extreme age.\r\nSome were unable to move, their bony frame being seemingly anchylosed.\r\nThey were old, wrinkled, and blear-eyed; their skin was hanging in\r\nleathery folds about their withered limbs; some had hair as white as\r\nsnow, and had seen some seven-score of years; others, still able to\r\ncrawl, but so aged as to be unable to stand, went slowly about on their\r\nhands and knees, their limbs being attenuated and withered. The organs\r\nof special sense had in many nearly lost all activity some generations\r\nback. Some had lost the use of their limbs for more than a decade or a\r\ngeneration; but the organs of life and the \"great sympathetic\" still\r\nkept up their automatic functions, not recognizing the fact, and\r\nsurprisingly indifferent to it, that the rest of the body had ceased to\r\nbe of any use a generation or more in the past. And it is remarked that\r\n\"these thoracic and abdominal organs and their physiological action\r\nbeing kept alive and active, as it were, against time, and the silent\r\nand unconscious functional activity of the great sympathetic and its\r\nganglia, show a tenacity of the animal tissues to hold on to life that\r\nis phenomenal.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TYPICAL GARDEN, NEAR SANTA ANA.]\r\n\r\nI have no space to enter upon the nature of the testimony upon which the\r\nage of certain Indians hereafter referred to is based. It is such as to\r\nsatisfy Dr. Remondino, Dr. Edward Palmer, long connected with the\r\nAgricultural Department of the Smithsonian Institution, and Father A. D.\r\nUbach, who has religious charge of the Indians in this region. These\r\nIndians were not migratory; they lived within certain limits, and were\r\nknown to each other. The missions established by the Franciscan friars\r\nwere built with the assistance of the Indians. The friars have handed\r\ndown by word of mouth many details in regard to their early missions;\r\nothers are found in the mission records, such as carefully kept records\r\nof family events--births, marriages, and deaths. And there is the\r\ntestimony of the Indians regarding each other. Father Ubach has known a\r\nnumber who were employed at the building of the mission of San Diego\r\n(1769-71), a century before he took charge of this mission. These men\r\nhad been engaged in carrying timber from the mountains or in making\r\nbrick, and many of them were living within the last twenty years. There\r\nare persons still living at the Indian village of Capitan Grande whose\r\nages he estimates at over one hundred and thirty years. Since the advent\r\nof civilization the abstemious habits and Spartan virtues of these\r\nIndians have been impaired, and their care for the aged has relaxed.\r\n\r\nDr. Palmer has a photograph (which I have seen) of a squaw whom he\r\nestimates to be 126 years old. When he visited her he saw her put six\r\nwatermelons in a blanket, tie it up, and carry it on her back for two\r\nmiles. He is familiar with Indian customs and history, and a careful\r\ncross-examination convinced him that her information of old customs was\r\nnot obtained by tradition. She was conversant with tribal habits she had\r\nseen practised, such as the cremation of the dead, which the mission\r\nfathers had compelled the Indians to relinquish. She had seen the\r\nIndians punished by the fathers with floggings for persisting in the\r\npractice of cremation.\r\n\r\nAt the mission of San Tomas, in Lower California, is still living an\r\nIndian (a photograph of whom Dr. Remondino shows), bent and wrinkled,\r\nwhose age is computed at 140 years. Although blind and naked, he is\r\nstill active, and daily goes down the beach and along the beds of the\r\ncreeks in search of drift-wood, making it his daily task to gather and\r\ncarry to camp a fagot of wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD ADOBE HOUSE, POMONA.]\r\n\r\nAnother instance I give in Dr. Remondino's words: \"Philip Crossthwaite,\r\nwho has lived here since 1843, has an old man on his ranch who mounts\r\nhis horse and rides about daily, who was a grown man breaking horses for\r\nthe mission fathers when Don Antonio Serrano was an infant. Don Antonio\r\nI know quite well, having attended him through a serious illness some\r\nsixteen years ago. Although now at the advanced age of ninety-three, he\r\nis as erect as a pine, and he rides his horse with his usual vigor and\r\ngrace. He is thin and spare and very tall, and those who knew him fifty\r\nyears or more remember him as the most skilful horseman in the\r\nneighborhood of San Diego. And yet, as fabulous as it may seem, the man\r\nwho danced this Don Antonio on his knee when he was an infant is not\r\nonly still alive, but is active enough to mount his horse and canter\r\nabout the country. Some years ago I attended an elderly gentleman, since\r\ndead, who knew this man as a full-grown man when he and Don Serrano were\r\nplay-children together. From a conversation with Father Ubach I learned\r\nthat the man's age is perfectly authenticated to be beyond one hundred\r\nand eighteen years.\"\r\n\r\nIn the many instances given of extreme old age in this region the habits\r\nof these Indians have been those of strict temperance and\r\nabstemiousness, and their long life in an equable climate is due to\r\nextreme simplicity of diet. In many cases of extreme age the diet has\r\nconsisted simply of acorns, flour, and water. It is asserted that the\r\nclimate itself induces temperance in drink and abstemiousness in diet.\r\nIn his estimate of the climate as a factor of longevity, Dr. Remondino\r\nsays that it is only necessary to look at the causes of death, and the\r\nages most subject to attack, to understand that the less of these causes\r\nthat are present the greater are the chances of man to reach great age.\r\n\"Add to these reflections that you run no gantlet of diseases to\r\nundermine or deteriorate the organism; that in this climate childhood\r\nfinds an escape from those diseases which are the terror of mothers, and\r\nagainst which physicians are helpless, as we have here none of those\r\naffections of the first three years of life so prevalent during the\r\nsummer months in the East and the rest of the United States. Then,\r\nagain, the chance of gastric or intestinal disease is almost incredibly\r\nsmall. This immunity extends through every age of life. Hepatic and\r\nkindred diseases are unknown; of lung affections there is no land that\r\ncan boast of like exemption. Be it the equability of the temperature or\r\nthe aseptic condition of the atmosphere, the free sweep of winds or the\r\nabsence of disease germs, or what else it may be ascribed to, one thing\r\nis certain, that there is no pneumonia, bronchitis, or pleurisy lying in\r\nwait for either the infant or the aged.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAN-PALM, FERNANDO ST. LOS ANGELES.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of this subject must excuse the space I have given to it.\r\nIt is evident from this testimony that here are climatic conditions\r\nnovel and worthy of the most patient scientific investigation. Their\r\neffect upon hereditary tendencies and upon persons coming here with\r\nhereditary diseases will be studied. Three years ago there was in some\r\nlocalities a visitation of small-pox imported from Mexico. At that time\r\nthere were cases of pneumonia. Whether these were incident to\r\ncarelessness in vaccination, or were caused by local unsanitary\r\nconditions, I do not know. It is not to be expected that unsanitary\r\nconditions will not produce disease here as elsewhere. It cannot be too\r\nstrongly insisted that this is a climate that the new-comer must get\r\nused to, and that he cannot safely neglect the ordinary precautions. The\r\ndifference between shade and sun is strikingly marked, and he must not\r\nbe deceived into imprudence by the prevailing sunshine or the general\r\nequability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nIS RESIDENCE HERE AGREEABLE?\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all these averages and statistics, and not considering now the\r\nchances of the speculator, the farmer, the fruit-raiser, or the invalid,\r\nis Southern California a particularly agreeable winter residence? The\r\nquestion deserves a candid answer, for it is of the last importance to\r\nthe people of the United States to know the truth--to know whether they\r\nhave accessible by rail a region free from winter rigor and\r\nvicissitudes, and yet with few of the disadvantages of most winter\r\nresorts. One would have more pleasure in answering the question if he\r\nwere not irritated by the perpetual note of brag and exaggeration in\r\nevery locality that each is the paradise of the earth, and absolutely\r\nfree from any physical discomfort. I hope that this note of exaggeration\r\nis not the effect of the climate, for if it is, the region will never be\r\nsocially agreeable.\r\n\r\nThere are no sudden changes of season here. Spring comes gradually day\r\nby day, a perceptible hourly waking to life and color; and this glides\r\ninto a summer which never ceases, but only becomes tired and fades into\r\nthe repose of a short autumn, when the sere and brown and red and yellow\r\nhills and the purple mountains are waiting for the rain clouds. This is\r\naccording to the process of nature; but wherever irrigation brings\r\nmoisture to the fertile soil, the green and bloom are perpetual the year\r\nround, only the green is powdered with dust, and the cultivated flowers\r\nhave their periods of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nI should think it well worth while to watch the procession of nature\r\nhere from late November or December to April. It is a land of delicate\r\nand brilliant wild flowers, of blooming shrubs, strange in form and\r\nwonderful in color. Before the annual rains the land lies in a sort of\r\nswoon in a golden haze; the slopes and plains are bare, the hills yellow\r\nwith ripe wild-oats or ashy gray with sage, the sea-breeze is weak, the\r\nair grows drier, the sun hot, the shade cool. Then one day light clouds\r\nstream up from the south-west, and there is a gentle rain. When the sun\r\ncomes out again its rays are milder, the land is refreshed and\r\nbrightened, and almost immediately a greenish tinge appears on plain and\r\nhill-side. At intervals the rain continues, daily the landscape is\r\ngreener in infinite variety of shades, which seem to sweep over the\r\nhills in waves of color. Upon this carpet of green by February nature\r\nbegins to weave an embroidery of wild flowers, white, lavender, golden,\r\npink, indigo, scarlet, changing day by day and every day more brilliant,\r\nand spreading from patches into great fields until dale and hill and\r\ntable-land are overspread with a refinement and glory of color that\r\nwould be the despair of the carpet-weavers of Daghestan.\r\n\r\nThis, with the scent of orange groves and tea-roses, with cool nights,\r\nsnow in sight on the high mountains, an occasional day of rain, days of\r\nbright sunshine, when an overcoat is needed in driving, must suffice\r\nthe sojourner for winter. He will be humiliated that he is more\r\nsensitive to cold than the heliotrope or the violet, but he must bear\r\nit. If he is looking for malaria, he must go to some other winter\r\nresort. If he wants a \"norther\" continuing for days, he must move on. If\r\nhe is accustomed to various insect pests, he will miss them here. If\r\nthere comes a day warmer than usual, it will not be damp or soggy. So\r\nfar as nature is concerned there is very little to grumble at, and one\r\nresource of the traveller is therefore taken away.\r\n\r\nBut is it interesting? What is there to do? It must be confessed that\r\nthere is a sort of monotony in the scenery as there is in the climate.\r\nThere is, to be sure, great variety in a way between coast and mountain,\r\nas, for instance, between Santa Barbara and Pasadena, and if the tourist\r\nwill make a business of exploring the valleys and uplands and cañons\r\nlittle visited, he will not complain of monotony; but the artist and the\r\nphotographer find the same elements repeated in little varying\r\ncombinations. There is undeniable repetition in the succession of\r\nflower-gardens, fruit orchards, alleys of palms and peppers, vineyards,\r\nand the cultivation about the villas is repeated in all directions. The\r\nAmericans have not the art of making houses or a land picturesque. The\r\ntraveller is enthusiastic about the exquisite drives through these\r\ngroves of fruit, with the ashy or the snow-covered hills for background\r\nand contrast, and he exclaims at the pretty cottages, vine and rose\r\nclad, in their semi-tropical setting, but if by chance he comes upon an\r\nold adobe or a Mexican ranch house in the country, he has emotions of a\r\ndifferent sort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCARLET PASSION-VINE.]\r\n\r\nThere is little left of the old Spanish occupation, but the remains of\r\nit make the romance of the country, and appeal to our sense of fitness\r\nand beauty. It is to be hoped that all such historical associations will\r\nbe preserved, for they give to the traveller that which our country\r\ngenerally lacks, and which is so largely the attraction of Italy and\r\nSpain. Instead of adapting and modifying the houses and homes that the\r\nclimate suggests, the new American comers have brought here from the\r\nEast the smartness and prettiness of our modern nondescript\r\narchitecture. The low house, with recesses and galleries, built round an\r\ninner court, or _patio_, which, however small, would fill the whole\r\ninterior with sunshine and the scent of flowers, is the sort of dwelling\r\nthat would suit the climate and the habit of life here. But the present\r\noccupiers have taken no hints from the natives. In village and country\r\nthey have done all they can, in spite of the maguey and the cactus and\r\nthe palm and the umbrella-tree and the live-oak and the riotous flowers\r\nand the thousand novel forms of vegetation, to give everything a prosaic\r\nlook. But why should the tourist find fault with this? The American\r\nlikes it, and he would not like the picturesqueness of the Spanish or\r\nthe Latin races.\r\n\r\nSo far as climate and natural beauty go to make one contented in a\r\nwinter resort, Southern California has unsurpassed attractions, and both\r\nseem to me to fit very well the American temperament; but the\r\nassociations of art and history are wanting, and the tourist knows how\r\nlargely his enjoyment of a vacation in Southern Italy or Sicily or\r\nNorthern Africa depends upon these--upon these and upon the aspects of\r\nhuman nature foreign to his experience.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that this is not Europe, either in its human\r\ninterest or in a certain refinement of landscape that comes only by long\r\ncultivation and the occupancy of ages. One advantage of foreign travel\r\nto the restless American is that he carries with him no responsibility\r\nfor the government or the progress of the country he is in, and that he\r\nleaves business behind him; whereas in this new country, which is his\r\nown, the development of which is so interesting, and in which the\r\nopportunities of fortune seem so inviting, he is constantly tempted \"to\r\ntake a hand in.\" If, however, he is superior to this fever, and is\r\nwilling simply to rest, to drift along with the equable days, I know of\r\nno other place where he can be more truly contented. Year by year the\r\ncountry becomes more agreeable for the traveller, in the first place,\r\nthrough the improvement in the hotels, and in the second, by better\r\nroads. In the large villages and cities there are miles of excellent\r\ndrives, well sprinkled, through delightful avenues, in a park-like\r\ncountry, where the eye is enchanted with color and luxurious vegetation,\r\nand captivated by the remarkable beauty of the hills, the wildness and\r\npicturesqueness of which enhance the charming cultivation of the\r\norchards and gardens. And no country is more agreeable for riding and\r\ndriving, for even at mid-day, in the direct sun rays, there is almost\r\neverywhere a refreshing breeze, and one rides or drives or walks with\r\nlittle sense of fatigue. The horses are uniformly excellent, either in\r\nthe carriage or under the saddle. I am sure they are remarkable in\r\nspeed, endurance, and ease of motion. If the visiting season had no\r\nother attraction, the horses would make it distinguished.\r\n\r\nA great many people like to spend months in a comfortable hotel,\r\nlounging on the piazzas, playing lawn-tennis, taking a morning ride or\r\nafternoon drive, making an occasional picnic excursion up some mountain\r\ncañon, getting up charades, playing at private theatricals, dancing,\r\nflirting, floating along with more or less sentiment and only the\r\nweariness that comes when there are no duties. There are plenty of\r\nplaces where all these things can be done, and with no sort of anxiety\r\nabout the weather from week to week, and with the added advantage that\r\nthe women and children can take care of themselves. But for those who\r\nfind such a life monotonous there are other resources. There is very\r\ngood fishing in the clear streams in the foot-hills, hunting in the\r\nmountains for large game still worthy of the steadiest nerves, and good\r\nbird-shooting everywhere. There are mountains to climb, cañons to\r\nexplore, lovely valleys in the recesses of the hills to be\r\ndiscovered--in short, one disposed to activity and not afraid of\r\nroughing it could occupy himself most agreeably and healthfully in the\r\nwild parts of San Bernardino and San Diego counties; he may even still\r\nstart a grizzly in the Sierra Madre range in Los Angeles County. Hunting\r\nand exploring in the mountains, riding over the mesas, which are green\r\nfrom the winter rains and gay with a thousand delicate grasses and\r\nflowering plants, is manly occupation to suit the most robust and\r\nadventurous. Those who saunter in the trim gardens, or fly from one\r\nhotel parlor to the other, do not see the best of Southern California in\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER ON THE COAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the distinction of this coast, and that which will forever make it\r\nattractive at the season when the North Atlantic is forbidding, is that\r\nthe ocean-side is as equable, as delightful, in winter as in summer. Its\r\nsea-side places are truly all-the-year-round resorts. In subsequent\r\nchapters I shall speak in detail of different places as to climate and\r\ndevelopment and peculiarities of production. I will now only give a\r\ngeneral idea of Southern California as a wintering place. Even as far\r\nnorth as Monterey, in the central part of the State, the famous Hotel\r\ndel Monte, with its magnificent park of pines and live-oaks, and\r\nexquisite flower-gardens underneath the trees, is remarkable for its\r\nsteadiness of temperature. I could see little difference between the\r\ntemperature of June and of February. The difference is of course\r\ngreatest at night. The maximum the year through ranges from about 65° to\r\nabout 80°, and the minimum from about 35° to about 58°, though there are\r\ndays when the thermometer goes above 90°, and nights when it falls below\r\n30°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSE-BUSH, SANTA BARBARA.]\r\n\r\nTo those who prefer the immediate ocean air to that air as modified by\r\nsuch valleys as the San Gabriel and the Santa Ana, the coast offers a\r\nvariety of choice in different combinations of sea and mountain climate\r\nall along the southern sunny exposure from Santa Barbara to San Diego.\r\nIn Santa Barbara County the Santa Inez range of mountains runs westward\r\nto meet the Pacific at Point Conception. South of this noble range are a\r\nnumber of little valleys opening to the sea, and in one of these, with a\r\nharbor and sloping upland and cañon of its own, lies Santa Barbara,\r\nlooking southward towards the sunny islands of Santa Rosa and Santa\r\nCruz. Above it is the Mission Cañon, at the entrance of which is the\r\nbest-preserved of the old Franciscan missions. There is a superb drive\r\neastward along the long and curving sea-beach of four miles to the cañon\r\nof Monticito, which is rather a series of nooks and terraces, of lovely\r\nplaces and gardens, of plantations of oranges and figs, rising up to the\r\nbase of the gray mountains. The long line of the Santa Inez suggests the\r\npromontory of Sorrento, and a view from the opposite rocky point, which\r\nencloses the harbor on the west, by the help of cypresses which look\r\nlike stone-pines, recalls many an Italian coast scene, and in situation\r\nthe Bay of Naples. The whole aspect is foreign, enchanting, and the\r\nsemi-tropical fruits and vines and flowers, with a golden atmosphere\r\npoured over all, irresistibly take the mind to scenes of Italian\r\nromance. There is still a little Spanish flavor left in the town, in a\r\nfew old houses, in names and families historic, and in the life without\r\nhurry or apprehension. There is a delightful commingling here of sea and\r\nmountain air, and in a hundred fertile nooks in the hills one in the\r\nmost delicate health may be sheltered from every harsh wind. I think no\r\none ever leaves Santa Barbara without a desire to return to it.\r\n\r\nFarther down the coast, only eighteen miles from Los Angeles, and a sort\r\nof Coney Island resort of that thriving city, is Santa Monica. Its hotel\r\nstands on a high bluff in a lovely bend of the coast. It is popular in\r\nsummer as well as winter, as the number of cottages attest, and it was\r\nchosen by the directors of the National Soldiers' Home as the site of\r\nthe Home on the Pacific coast. There the veterans, in a commodious\r\nbuilding, dream away their lives most contentedly, and can fancy that\r\nthey hear the distant thunder of guns in the pounding of the surf.\r\n\r\nAt about the same distance from Los Angeles, southward, above Point\r\nVincent, is Redondo Beach, a new resort, which, from its natural beauty\r\nand extensive improvements, promises to be a delightful place of sojourn\r\nat any time of the year. The mountainous, embracing arms of the bay are\r\nexquisite in contour and color, and the beach is very fine. The hotel is\r\nperfectly comfortable--indeed, uncommonly attractive--and the extensive\r\nplanting of trees, palms, and shrubs, and the cultivation of flowers,\r\nwill change the place in a year or two into a scene of green and floral\r\nloveliness; in this region two years, such is the rapid growth, suffices\r\nto transform a desert into a park or garden. On the hills, at a little\r\ndistance from the beach and pier, are the buildings of the Chautauqua,\r\nwhich holds a local summer session here. The Chautauqua people, the\r\ncountry over, seem to have, in selecting sightly and agreeable sites for\r\ntheir temples of education and amusement, as good judgment as the old\r\nmonks had in planting their monasteries and missions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT AVALON, SANTA CATALINA ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nIf one desires a thoroughly insular climate, he may cross to the\r\npicturesque island of Santa Catalina. All along the coast flowers bloom\r\nin the winter months, and the ornamental semi-tropical plants thrive;\r\nand there are many striking headlands and pretty bays and gentle seaward\r\nslopes which are already occupied by villages, and attract visitors who\r\nwould practise economy. The hills frequently come close to the shore,\r\nforming those valleys in which the Californians of the pastoral period\r\nplaced their ranch houses. At San Juan Capristrano the fathers had one\r\nof their most flourishing missions, the ruins of which are the most\r\npicturesque the traveller will find. It is altogether a genial,\r\nattractive coast, and if the tourist does not prefer an inland\r\nsituation, like the Hotel Raymond (which scarcely has a rival anywhere\r\nin its lovely surroundings), he will keep on down the coast to San\r\nDiego.\r\n\r\nThe transition from the well-planted counties of Los Angeles and Orange\r\nis not altogether agreeable to the eye. One misses the trees. The\r\ngeneral aspect of the coast about San Diego is bare in comparison. This\r\nsimply means that the southern county is behind the others in\r\ndevelopment. Nestled among the hills there are live-oaks and sycamores;\r\nand of course at National City and below, in El Cajon and the valley of\r\nthe Sweetwater, there are extensive plantations of oranges, lemons,\r\nolives, and vines, but the San Diego region generally lies in the sun\r\nshadeless. I have a personal theory that much vegetation is inconsistent\r\nwith the best atmosphere for the human being. The air is nowhere else so\r\nagreeable to me as it is in a barren New Mexican or Arizona desert at\r\nthe proper elevation. I do not know whether the San Diego climate would\r\nbe injured if the hills were covered with forest and the valleys were\r\nall in the highest and most luxuriant vegetation. The theory is that the\r\ninteraction of the desert and ocean winds will always keep it as it is,\r\nwhatever man may do. I can only say that, as it is, I doubt if it has\r\nits equal the year round for agreeableness and healthfulness in our\r\nUnion; and it is the testimony of those whose experience of the best\r\nMediterranean climate is more extended and much longer continued than\r\nmine, that it is superior to any on that enclosed sea. About this great\r\nharbor, whose outer beach has an extent of twenty-five miles, whose\r\ninland circuit of mountains must be over fifty miles, there are great\r\nvarieties of temperature, of shelter and exposure, minute subdivisions\r\nof climate, whose personal fitness can only be attested by experience.\r\nThere is a great difference, for instance, between the quality of the\r\nclimate at the elevation of the Florence Hotel, San Diego, and the\r\nUniversity Heights on the mesa above the town, and that on the long\r\nCoronado Beach which protects the inner harbor from the ocean surf. The\r\nlatter, practically surrounded by water, has a true marine climate, but\r\na peculiar and dry marine climate, as tonic in its effect as that of\r\nCapri, and, I believe, with fewer harsh days in the winter season. I\r\nwish to speak with entire frankness about this situation, for I am sure\r\nthat what so much pleases me will suit a great number of people, who\r\nwill thank me for not being reserved. Doubtless it will not suit\r\nhundreds of people as well as some other localities in Southern\r\nCalifornia, but I found no other place where I had the feeling of\r\nabsolute content and willingness to stay on indefinitely. There is a\r\ngeniality about it for which the thermometer does not account, a charm\r\nwhich it is difficult to explain. Much of the agreeability is due to\r\nartificial conditions, but the climate man has not made nor marred.\r\n\r\nThe Coronado Beach is about twelve miles long. A narrow sand promontory,\r\nrunning northward from the main-land, rises to the Heights, then\r\nbroadens into a table-land, which seems to be an island, and measures\r\nabout a mile and a half each way; this is called South Beach, and is\r\nconnected by another spit of sand with a like area called North Beach,\r\nwhich forms, with Point Loma, the entrance to the harbor. The North\r\nBeach, covered partly with chaparral and broad fields of barley, is\r\nalive with quail, and is a favorite coursing-ground for rabbits. The\r\nsoil, which appears uninviting, is with water uncommonly fertile, being\r\na mixture of loam, disintegrated granite, and decomposed shells, and\r\nespecially adapted to flowers, rare tropical trees, fruits, and\r\nflowering shrubs of all countries.\r\n\r\nThe development is on the South Beach, which was in January, 1887,\r\nnothing but a waste of sand and chaparral. I doubt if the world can show\r\na like transformation in so short a time. I saw it in February of that\r\nyear, when all the beauty, except that of ocean, sky, and atmosphere,\r\nwas still to be imagined. It is now as if the wand of the magician had\r\ntouched it. In the first place, abundance of water was brought over by a\r\nsubmarine conduit, and later from the extraordinary Coronado Springs\r\n(excellent soft water for drinking and bathing, and with a recognized\r\nmedicinal value), and with these streams the beach began to bloom like a\r\ntropical garden. Tens of thousands of trees have attained a remarkable\r\ngrowth in three years. The nursery is one of the most interesting\r\nbotanical and flower gardens in the country; palms and hedges of\r\nMonterey cypress and marguerites line the avenues. There are parks and\r\ngardens of rarest flowers and shrubs, whose brilliant color produces the\r\nsame excitement in the mind as strains of martial music. A railway\r\ntraverses the beach for a mile from the ferry to the hotel. There are\r\nhundreds of cottages with their gardens scattered over the surface;\r\nthere is a race-track, a museum, an ostrich farm, a labyrinth, good\r\nroads for driving, and a dozen other attractions for the idle or the\r\ninquisitive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOTEL DEL CORONADO.]\r\n\r\nThe hotel stands upon the south front of the beach and near the sea,\r\nabove which it is sufficiently elevated to give a fine prospect. The\r\nsound of the beating surf is perpetual there. At low tide there is a\r\nsplendid driving beach miles in extent, and though the slope is abrupt,\r\nthe opportunity for bathing is good, with a little care in regard to the\r\nundertow. But there is a safe natatorium on the harbor side close to the\r\nhotel. The stranger, when he first comes upon this novel hotel and this\r\nmarvellous scene of natural and created beauty, is apt to exhaust his\r\nsuperlatives. I hesitate to attempt to describe this hotel--this airy\r\nand picturesque and half-bizarre wooden creation of the architect.\r\nTaking it and its situation together, I know nothing else in the world\r\nwith which to compare it, and I have never seen any other which so\r\nsurprised at first, that so improved on a two weeks' acquaintance, and\r\nthat has left in the mind an impression so entirely agreeable. It covers\r\nabout four and a half acres of ground, including an inner court of about\r\nan acre, the rich made soil of which is raised to the level of the main\r\nfloor. The house surrounds this, in the Spanish mode of building, with a\r\nseries of galleries, so that most of the suites of rooms have a double\r\noutlook--one upon this lovely garden, the other upon the ocean or the\r\nharbor. The effect of this interior court or _patio_ is to give gayety\r\nand an air of friendliness to the place, brilliant as it is with flowers\r\nand climbing vines; and when the royal and date palms that are\r\nvigorously thriving in it attain their growth it will be magnificent.\r\nBig hotels and caravansaries are usually tiresome, unfriendly places;\r\nand if I should lay too much stress upon the vast dining-room (which has\r\na floor area of ten thousand feet without post or pillar), or the\r\nbeautiful breakfast-room, or the circular ballroom (which has an area of\r\neleven thousand feet, with its timber roof open to the lofty\r\nobservatory), or the music-room, billiard-rooms for ladies, the\r\nreading-rooms and parlors, the pretty gallery overlooking the spacious\r\noffice rotunda, and then say that the whole is illuminated with electric\r\nlights, and capable of being heated to any temperature desired--I might\r\nconvey a false impression as to the actual comfort and home-likeness of\r\nthis charming place. On the sea side the broad galleries of each story\r\nare shut in by glass, which can be opened to admit or shut to exclude\r\nthe fresh ocean breeze. Whatever the temperature outside, those great\r\ngalleries are always agreeable for lounging or promenading. For me, I\r\nnever tire of the sea and its changing color and movement. If this great\r\nhouse were filled with guests, so spacious are its lounging places I\r\nshould think it would never appear to be crowded; and if it were nearly\r\nempty, so admirably are the rooms contrived for family life it will not\r\nseem lonesome. I shall add that the management is of the sort that makes\r\nthe guest feel at home and at ease. Flowers, brought in from the gardens\r\nand nurseries, are every where in profusion--on the dining-tables, in\r\nthe rooms, all about the house. So abundantly are they produced that no\r\namount of culling seems to make an impression upon their mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSTRICH YARD, CORONADO BEACH.]\r\n\r\nBut any description would fail to give the secret of the charm of\r\nexistence here. Restlessness disappears, for one thing, but there is no\r\nlanguor or depression. I cannot tell why, when the thermometer is at 60°\r\nor 63°, the air seems genial and has no sense of chilliness, or why it\r\nis not oppressive at 80° or 85°. I am sure the place will not suit those\r\nwhose highest idea of winter enjoyment is tobogganing and an ice palace,\r\nnor those who revel in the steam and languor of a tropical island; but\r\nfor a person whose desires are moderate, whose tastes are temperate, who\r\nis willing for once to be good-humored and content in equable\r\nconditions, I should commend Coronado Beach and the Hotel del Coronado,\r\nif I had not long ago learned that it is unsafe to commend to any human\r\nbeing a climate or a doctor.\r\n\r\nBut you can take your choice. It lies there, our Mediterranean region,\r\non a blue ocean, protected by barriers of granite from the Northern\r\ninfluences, an infinite variety of plain, cañon, hills, valleys,\r\nsea-coast; our New Italy without malaria, and with every sort of fruit\r\nwhich we desire (except the tropical), which will be grown in perfection\r\nwhen our knowledge equals our ambition; and if you cannot find a winter\r\nhome there or pass some contented weeks in the months of Northern\r\ninclemency, you are weighing social advantages against those of the\r\nleast objectionable climate within the Union. It is not yet proved that\r\nthis equability and the daily out-door life possible there will change\r\ncharacter, but they are likely to improve the disposition and soften the\r\nasperities of common life. At any rate, there is a land where from\r\nNovember to April one has not to make a continual fight with the\r\nelements to keep alive.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that this land of the sun and of the equable climate\r\nwill have the effect that other lands of a southern aspect have upon\r\ntemperament and habits. It is feared that Northern-bred people, who are\r\nguided by the necessity of making hay while the sun shines, will not\r\nmake hay at all in a land where the sun always shines. It is thought\r\nthat unless people are spurred on incessantly by the exigencies of the\r\nchanging seasons they will lose energy, and fall into an idle floating\r\nalong with gracious nature. Will not one sink into a comfortable and\r\neasy procrastination if he has a whole year in which to perform the\r\nlabor of three months? Will Southern California be an exception to those\r\nlands of equable climate and extraordinary fertility where every effort\r\nis postponed till \"to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nI wish there might be something solid in this expectation; that this may\r\nbe a region where the restless American will lose something of his hurry\r\nand petty, feverish ambition. Partially it may be so. He will take, he\r\nis already taking, something of the tone of the climate and of the old\r\nSpanish occupation. But the race instinct of thrift and of \"getting on\"\r\nwill not wear out in many generations. Besides, the condition of living\r\nat all in Southern California in comfort, and with the social life\r\nindispensable to our people, demands labor, not exhausting and killing,\r\nbut still incessant--demands industry. A land that will not yield\r\nsatisfactorily without irrigation, and whose best paying produce\r\nrequires intelligent as well as careful husbandry, will never be an idle\r\nland. Egypt, with all its _dolce far niente_, was never an idle land for\r\nthe laborer.\r\n\r\nIt may be expected, however, that no more energy will be developed or\r\nencouraged than is needed for the daily tasks, and these tasks being\r\nlighter than elsewhere, and capable of being postponed, that there will\r\nbe less stress and strain in the daily life. Although the climate of\r\nSouthern California is not enervating, in fact is stimulating to the\r\nnew-comer, it is doubtless true that the monotony of good weather, of\r\nthe sight of perpetual bloom and color in orchards and gardens, will\r\ntake away nervousness and produce a certain placidity, which might be\r\ntaken for laziness by a Northern observer. It may be that engagements\r\nwill not be kept with desired punctuality, under the impression that the\r\nenjoyment of life does not depend upon exact response to the second-hand\r\nof a watch; and it is not unpleasant to think that there is a corner of\r\nthe Union where there will be a little more leisure, a little more of\r\nserene waiting on Providence, an abatement of the restless rush and\r\nhaste of our usual life. The waves of population have been rolling\r\nwestward for a long time, and now, breaking over the mountains, they\r\nflow over Pacific slopes and along the warm and inviting seas. Is it\r\naltogether an unpleasing thought that the conditions of life will be\r\nsomewhat easier there, that there will be some physical repose, the race\r\nhaving reached the sunset of the continent, comparable to the desirable\r\nplacidity of life called the sunset of old age? This may be altogether\r\nfanciful, but I have sometimes felt, in the sunny moderation of nature\r\nthere, that this land might offer for thousands at least a winter of\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL OUTLOOK.--LAND AND PRICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the northern limit of California to the southern is about the same\r\ndistance as from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Charleston, South\r\nCarolina. Of these two coast lines, covering nearly ten degrees of\r\nlatitude, or over seven hundred miles, the Atlantic has greater extremes\r\nof climate and greater monthly variations, and the Pacific greater\r\nvariety of productions. The State of California is, however, so\r\nmountainous, cut by longitudinal and transverse ranges, that any\r\nreasonable person can find in it a temperature to suit him the year\r\nthrough. But it does not need to be explained that it would be difficult\r\nto hit upon any general characteristic that would apply to the stretch\r\nof the Atlantic coast named, as a guide to a settler looking for a home;\r\nthe description of Massachusetts would be wholly misleading for South\r\nCarolina. It is almost as difficult to make any comprehensive statement\r\nabout the long line of the California coast.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, limiting the inquiry to the southern third of\r\nthe State--an area of about fifty-eight thousand square miles, as large\r\nas Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode\r\nIsland--to answer fairly some of the questions oftenest asked about it.\r\nThese relate to the price of land, its productiveness, the kind of\r\nproducts most profitable, the sort of labor required, and its\r\ndesirability as a place of residence for the laborer, for the farmer or\r\nhorticulturist of small means, and for the man with considerable\r\ncapital. Questions on these subjects cannot be answered categorically,\r\nbut I hope to be able, by setting down my own observations and using\r\ntrustworthy reports, to give others the material on which to exercise\r\ntheir judgment. In the first place, I think it demonstrable that a\r\nperson would profitably exchange 160 acres of farming land east of the\r\none hundredth parallel for ten acres, with a water right, in Southern\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YUCCA-PALM.]\r\n\r\nIn making this estimate I do not consider the question of health or\r\nmerely the agreeability of the climate, but the conditions of labor, the\r\nease with which one could support a family, and the profits over and\r\nabove a fair living. It has been customary in reckoning the value of\r\nland there to look merely to the profit of it beyond its support of a\r\nfamily, forgetting that agriculture and horticulture the world over,\r\nlike almost all other kinds of business, usually do little more than\r\nprocure a good comfortable living, with incidental education, to those\r\nwho engage in them. That the majority of the inhabitants of Southern\r\nCalifornia will become rich by the culture of the orange and the vine is\r\nan illusion; but it is not an illusion that twenty times its present\r\npopulation can live there in comfort, in what might be called luxury\r\nelsewhere, by the cultivation of the soil, all far removed from poverty\r\nand much above the condition of the majority of the inhabitants of the\r\nforeign wine and fruit-producing countries. This result is assured by\r\nthe extraordinary productiveness of the land, uninterrupted the year\r\nthrough, and by the amazing extension of the market in the United States\r\nfor products that can be nowhere else produced with such certainty and\r\nprofusion as in California. That State is only just learning how to\r\nsupply a demand which is daily increasing, but it already begins to\r\ncommand the market in certain fruits. This command of the market in the\r\nfuture will depend upon itself, that is, whether it will send East and\r\nNorth only sound wine, instead of crude, ill-cured juice of the grape,\r\nonly the best and most carefully canned apricots, nectarines, peaches,\r\nand plums, only the raisins and prunes perfectly prepared, only such\r\noranges, lemons, and grapes and pears as the Californians are willing to\r\neat themselves. California has yet much to learn about fruit-raising and\r\nfruit-curing, but it already knows that to compete with the rest of the\r\nworld in our markets it must beat the rest of the world in quality. It\r\nwill take some time yet to remove the unfavorable opinion of California\r\nwines produced in the East by the first products of the vineyards sent\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DATE-PALM.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty for the settler is that he cannot \"take up\" ten acres\r\nwith water in California as he can 160 acres elsewhere. There is left\r\nlittle available Government land. There is plenty of government land not\r\ntaken up and which may never be occupied, that is, inaccessible mountain\r\nand irreclaimable desert. There are also little nooks and fertile spots\r\nhere and there to be discovered which may be pre-empted, and which will\r\nsome day have value. But practically all the arable land, or that is\r\nlikely to become so, is owned now in large tracts, under grants or by\r\nwholesale purchase. The circumstances of the case compelled associate\r\neffort. Such a desert as that now blooming region known as Pasadena,\r\nPomona, Riverside, and so on, could not be subdued by individual\r\nexertion. Consequently land and water companies were organized. They\r\nbought large tracts of unimproved land, built dams in the mountain\r\ncañons, sunk wells, drew water from the rivers, made reservoirs, laid\r\npipes, carried ditches and conduits across the country, and then sold\r\nthe land with the inseparable water right in small parcels. Thus the\r\nregion became subdivided among small holders, each independent, but all\r\nmutually dependent as to water, which is the _sine qua non_ of\r\nexistence. It is only a few years since there was a forlorn and\r\nstruggling colony a few miles east of Los Angeles known as the Indiana\r\nsettlement. It had scant water, no railway communication, and everything\r\nto learn about horticulture. That spot is now the famous Pasadena.\r\n\r\nWhat has been done in the Santa Ana and San Gabriel valleys will be done\r\nelsewhere in the State. There are places in Kern County, north of the\r\nSierra Madre, where the land produces grain and alfalfa without\r\nirrigation, where farms can be bought at from five to ten dollars an\r\nacre--land that will undoubtedly increase in value with settlement and\r\nalso by irrigation. The great county of San Diego is practically\r\nundeveloped, and contains an immense area, in scattered mesas and\r\nvalleys, of land which will produce apples, grain, and grass without\r\nirrigation, and which the settler can get at moderate prices. Nay, more,\r\nany one with a little ready money, who goes to Southern California\r\nexpecting to establish himself and willing to work, will be welcomed and\r\naided, and be pretty certain to find some place where he can steadily\r\nimprove his condition. But the regions about which one hears most,\r\nwhich are already fruit gardens and well sprinkled with rose-clad homes,\r\ncommand prices per acre which seem extravagant. Land, however, like a\r\nmine, gets its value from what it will produce; and it is to be noted\r\nthat while the subsidence of the \"boom\" knocked the value out of\r\ntwenty-feet city lots staked out in the wilderness, and out of insanely\r\ninflated city property, the land upon which crops are raised has\r\nsteadily appreciated in value.\r\n\r\nSo many conditions enter into the price of land that it is impossible to\r\nname an average price for the arable land of the southern counties, but\r\nI have heard good judges place it at $100 an acre. The lands, with\r\nwater, are very much alike in their producing power, but some, for\r\nclimatic reasons, are better adapted to citrus fruits, others to the\r\nraisin grape, and others to deciduous fruits. The value is also affected\r\nby railway facilities, contiguity to the local commercial centre, and\r\nalso by the character of the settlement--that is, by its morality,\r\npublic spirit, and facilities for education. Every town and settlement\r\nthinks it has special advantages as to improved irrigation, equability\r\nof temperature, adaptation to this or that product, attractions for\r\ninvalids, tempered ocean breezes, protection from \"northers,\" schools,\r\nand varied industries. These things are so much matter of personal\r\nchoice that each settler will do well to examine widely for himself, and\r\nnot buy until he is suited.\r\n\r\nSome figures, which may be depended on, of actual sales and of annual\r\nyields, may be of service. They are of the district east of Pasadena and\r\nPomona, but fairly represent the whole region down to Los Angeles. The\r\nselling price of raisin grape land unimproved, but with water, at\r\nRiverside is $250 to $300 per acre; at South Riverside, $150 to $200; in\r\nthe highland district of San Bernardino, and at Redlands (which is a new\r\nsettlement east of the city of San Bernardino), $200 to $250 per acre.\r\nAt Banning and at Hesperia, which lie north of the San Bernardino range,\r\n$125 to $150 per acre are the prices asked. Distance from the commercial\r\ncentre accounts for the difference in price in the towns named. The crop\r\nvaries with the care and skill of the cultivator, but a fair average\r\nfrom the vines at two years is two tons per acre; three years, three\r\ntons; four years, five tons; five years, seven tons. The price varies\r\nwith the season, and also whether its sale is upon the vines, or after\r\npicking, drying, and sweating, or the packed product. On the vines $20\r\nper ton is a fair average price. In exceptional cases vineyards at\r\nRiverside have produced four tons per acre in twenty months from the\r\nsetting of the cuttings, and six-year-old vines have produced thirteen\r\nand a half tons per acre. If the grower has a crop of, say, 2000 packed\r\nboxes of raisins of twenty pounds each box, it will pay him to pack his\r\nown crop and establish a \"brand\" for it. In 1889 three adjoining\r\nvineyards in Riverside, producing about the same average crops, were\r\nsold as follows: The first vineyard, at $17 50 per ton on the vines,\r\nyielded $150 per acre; the second, at six cents a pound, in the sweat\r\nboxes, yielded $276 per acre; the third, at $1 80 per box, packed,\r\nyielded $414 per acre.\r\n\r\nLand adapted to the deciduous fruits, such as apricots and peaches, is\r\nworth as much as raisin land, and some years pays better. The pear and\r\nthe apple need greater elevation, and are of better quality when grown\r\non high ground than in the valleys. I have reason to believe that the\r\nmountain regions of San Diego County are specially adapted to the apple.\r\n\r\nGood orange land unimproved, but with water, is worth from $300 to $500\r\nan acre. If we add to this price the cost of budded trees, the care of\r\nthem for four years, and interest at eight per cent. per annum for four\r\nyears, the cost of a good grove will be about $1000 an acre. It must be\r\nunderstood that the profit of an orange grove depends upon care, skill,\r\nand business ability. The kind of orange grown with reference to the\r\ndemand, the judgment about more or less irrigation as affecting the\r\nquality, the cultivation of the soil, and the arrangements for\r\nmarketing, are all elements in the problem. There are young groves at\r\nRiverside, five years old, that are paying ten per cent. net upon from\r\n$3000 to $5000 an acre; while there are older groves, which, at the\r\nprices for fruit in the spring of 1890--$1 60 per box for seedlings and\r\n$3 per box for navels delivered at the packing-houses--paid at the rate\r\nof ten per cent. net on $7500 per acre.\r\n\r\nIn all these estimates water must be reckoned as a prime factor. What,\r\nthen, is water worth per inch, generally, in all this fruit region from\r\nRedlands to Los Angeles? It is worth just the amount it will add to the\r\ncommercial value of land irrigated by it, and that may be roughly\r\nestimated at from $500 to $1000 an inch of continuous flow. Take an\r\nillustration. A piece of land at Riverside below the flow of water was\r\nworth $300 an acre. Contiguous to it was another piece not irrigated\r\nwhich would not sell for $50 an acre. By bringing water to it, it would\r\nquickly sell for $300, thus adding $250 to its value. As the estimate\r\nat Riverside is that one inch of water will irrigate five acres of fruit\r\nland, five times $250 would be $1250 per inch, at which price water for\r\nirrigation has actually been sold at Riverside.\r\n\r\nThe standard of measurement of water in Southern California is the\r\nminer's inch under four inches' pressure, or the amount that will flow\r\nthrough an inch-square opening under a pressure of four inches measured\r\nfrom the surface of the water in the conduit to the centre of the\r\nopening through which it flows. This is nine gallons a minute, or, as it\r\nis figured, 1728 cubic feet or 12,960 gallons in twenty-four hours, and\r\n1.50 of a cubic foot a second. This flow would cover ten acres about\r\neighteen inches deep in a year; that is, it would give the land the\r\nequivalent of eighteen inches of rain, distributed exactly when and\r\nwhere it was needed, none being wasted, and more serviceable than fifty\r\ninches of rainfall as it generally comes. This, with the natural\r\nrainfall, is sufficient for citrus fruits and for corn and alfalfa, in\r\nsoil not too sandy, and it is too much for grapes and all deciduous\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANTAGES OF IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to understand this problem of irrigation in order to\r\ncomprehend Southern California, the exceptional value of its arable\r\nland, the certainty and great variety of its products, and the part it\r\nis to play in our markets. There are three factors in the expectation of\r\na crop--soil, sunshine, and water. In a region where we can assume the\r\nfirst two to be constant, the only uncertainty is water. Southern\r\nCalifornia is practically without rain from May to December. Upon this\r\nfact rests the immense value of its soil, and the certainty that it can\r\nsupply the rest of the Union with a great variety of products. This\r\ncertainty must be purchased by a previous investment of money. Water is\r\neverywhere to be had for money, in some localities by surface wells, in\r\nothers by artesian-wells, in others from such streams as the Los Angeles\r\nand the Santa Ana, and from reservoirs secured by dams in the heart of\r\nthe high mountains. It is possible to compute the cost of any one of the\r\nsystems of irrigation, to determine whether it will pay by calculating\r\nthe amount of land it will irrigate. The cost of procuring water varies\r\ngreatly with the situation, and it is conceivable that money can be lost\r\nin such an investment, but I have yet to hear of any irrigation that has\r\nnot been more or less successful.\r\n\r\nFarming and fruit-raising are usually games of hazard. Good crops and\r\npoor crops depend upon enough rain and not too much at just the right\r\ntimes. A wheat field which has a good start with moderate rain may later\r\nwither in a drought, or be ruined by too much water at the time of\r\nmaturity. And, avoiding all serious reverses from either dryness or wet,\r\nevery farmer knows that the quality and quantity of the product would be\r\nimmensely improved if the growing stalks and roots could have water when\r\nand only when they need it. The difference would be between, say, twenty\r\nand forty bushels of grain or roots to the acre, and that means the\r\ndifference between profit and loss. There is probably not a crop of any\r\nkind grown in the great West that would not be immensely benefited if it\r\ncould be irrigated once or twice a year; and probably anywhere that\r\nwater is attainable the cost of irrigation would be abundantly paid in\r\nthe yield from year to year. Farming in the West with even a little\r\nirrigation would not be the game of hazard that it is. And it may\r\nfurther be assumed that there is not a vegetable patch or a fruit\r\norchard East or West that would not yield better quality and more\r\nabundantly with irrigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISIN-CURING.]\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Any farmer who attempts to raise grass and potatoes\r\nand strawberries on contiguous fields, subject to the same chance of\r\ndrought or rainfall, has a vivid sense of his difficulties. The potatoes\r\nare spoiled by the water that helps the grass, and the coquettish\r\nstrawberry will not thrive on the regimen that suits the grosser crops.\r\nIn California, which by its climate and soil gives a greater variety of\r\nproducts than any other region in the Union, the supply of water is\r\nadjusted to the needs of each crop, even on contiguous fields. No two\r\nproducts need the same amount of water, or need it at the same time. The\r\norange needs more than the grape, the alfalfa more than the orange, the\r\npeach and apricot less than the orange; the olive, the fig, the almond,\r\nthe English walnut, demand each a different supply. Depending entirely\r\non irrigation six months of the year, the farmer in Southern California\r\nis practically certain of his crop year after year; and if all his\r\nplants and trees are in a healthful condition, as they will be if he is\r\nnot too idle to cultivate as well as irrigate, his yield will be about\r\ndouble what it would be without systematic irrigation. It is this\r\npractical control of the water the year round, in a climate where\r\nsunshine is the rule, that makes the productiveness of California so\r\nlarge as to be incomprehensible to Eastern people. Even the trees are\r\nnot dormant more than three or four months in the year.\r\n\r\nBut irrigation, in order to be successful, must be intelligently\r\napplied. In unskilful hands it may work more damage than benefit. Mr.\r\nTheodore S. Van Dyke, who may always be quoted with confidence, says\r\nthat the ground should never be flooded; that water must not touch the\r\nplant or tree, or come near enough to make the soil bake around it; and\r\nthat it should be let in in small streams for two or three days, and not\r\nin large streams for a few hours. It is of the first importance that the\r\nground shall be stirred as soon as dry enough, the cultivation to be\r\ncontinued, and water never to be substituted for the cultivator to\r\nprevent baking. The methods of irrigation in use may be reduced to\r\nthree. First, the old Mexican way--running a small ditch from tree to\r\ntree, without any basin round the tree. Second, the basin system, where\r\na large basin is made round the tree, and filled several times. This\r\nshould only be used where water is scarce, for it trains the roots like\r\na brush, instead of sending them out laterally into the soil. Third, the\r\nRiverside method, which is the best in the world, and produces the\r\nlargest results with the least water and the least work. It is the\r\nclosest imitation of the natural process of wetting by gentle rain. \"A\r\nsmall flume, eight or ten inches square, of common red-wood is laid\r\nalong the upper side of a ten-acre tract. At intervals of one to three\r\nfeet, according to the nature of the ground and the stuff to be\r\nirrigated, are bored one-inch holes, with a small wooden button over\r\nthem to regulate the flow. This flume costs a trifle, is left in\r\nposition, lasts for years, and is always ready. Into this flume is\r\nturned from the ditch an irrigating head of 20, 25, or 30 inches of\r\nwater, generally about 20 inches. This is divided by the holes and the\r\nbuttons into streams of from one-sixth to one-tenth of an inch each,\r\nmaking from 120 to 200 small streams. From five to seven furrows are\r\nmade between two rows of trees, two between rows of grapes, one furrow\r\nbetween rows of corn, potatoes, etc. It may take from fifteen to twenty\r\nhours for one of the streams to get across the tract. They are allowed\r\nto run from forty-eight to seventy-two hours. The ground is then\r\nthoroughly wet in all directions, and three or four feet deep. As soon\r\nas the ground is dry enough cultivation is begun, and kept up from six\r\nto eight weeks before water is used again.\" Only when the ground is very\r\nsandy is the basin system necessary. Long experiment has taught that\r\nthis system is by far the best; and, says Mr. Van Dyke, \"Those whose\r\nideas are taken from the wasteful systems of flooding or soaking from\r\nbig ditches have something to learn in Southern California.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the quantity of water needed in the kind of soil most common in\r\nSouthern California I will again quote Mr. Van Dyke: \"They will tell you\r\nat Riverside that they use an inch of water to five acres, and some say\r\nan inch to three acres. But this is because they charge to the land all\r\nthe waste on the main ditch, and because they use thirty per cent. of\r\nthe water in July and August, when it is the lowest. But this is no test\r\nof the duty of water; the amount actually delivered on the land should\r\nbe taken. What they actually use for ten acres at Riverside, Redlands,\r\netc., is a twenty-inch stream of three days' run five times a year,\r\nequal to 300 inches for one day, or one inch steady run for 300 days. As\r\nan inch is the equivalent of 365 inches for one day, or one inch for 365\r\ndays, 300 inches for one day equals an inch to twelve acres. Many use\r\neven less than this, running the water only two or two and a half days\r\nat a time. Others use more head; but it rarely exceeds 24 inches for\r\nthree days and five times a year, which would be 72 multiplied by 5, or\r\n360 inches--a little less than a full inch for a year for ten acres.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRRIGATION BY ARTESIAN-WELL SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRRIGATION BY PIPE SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nI have given room to these details because the Riverside experiment,\r\nwhich results in such large returns of excellent fruit, is worthy of the\r\nattention of cultivators everywhere. The constant stirring of the soil,\r\nto keep it loose as well as to keep down useless growths, is second in\r\nimportance only to irrigation. Some years ago, when it was ascertained\r\nthat tracts of land which had been regarded as only fit for herding\r\ncattle and sheep would by good ploughing and constant cultivation\r\nproduce fair crops without any artificial watering, there spread abroad\r\na notion that irrigation could be dispensed with. There are large areas,\r\ndry and cracked on the surface, where the soil is moist three and four\r\nfeet below the surface in the dry season. By keeping the surface broken\r\nand well pulverized the moisture rises sufficiently to insure a crop.\r\nMany Western farmers have found out this secret of cultivation, and more\r\nwill learn in time the good sense of not spreading themselves over too\r\nlarge an area; that forty acres planted and cultivated will give a\r\nbetter return than eighty acres planted and neglected. Crops of various\r\nsorts are raised in Southern California by careful cultivation with\r\nlittle or no irrigation, but the idea that cultivation alone will bring\r\nsufficiently good production is now practically abandoned, and the\r\nalmost universal experience is that judicious irrigation always improves\r\nthe crop in quality and in quantity, and that irrigation and cultivation\r\nare both essential to profitable farming or fruit-raising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANCE FOR LABORERS AND SMALL FARMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, that capital is necessary for successful\r\nagriculture or horticulture in Southern California. But where is it not\r\nneeded? In New England? In Kansas, where land which was given to actual\r\nsettlers is covered with mortgages for money absolutely necessary to\r\ndevelop it? But passing this by, what is the chance in Southern\r\nCalifornia for laborers and for mechanics? Let us understand the\r\nsituation. In California there is no exception to the rule that\r\ncontinual labor, thrift, and foresight are essential to the getting of a\r\ngood living or the gaining of a competence. No doubt speculation will\r\nspring up again. It is inevitable with the present enormous and yearly\r\nincreasing yield of fruits, the better intelligence in vine culture,\r\nwine-making, and raisin-curing, the growth of marketable oranges,\r\nlemons, etc., and the consequent rise in the value of land. Doubtless\r\nfortunes will be made by enterprising companies who secure large areas\r\nof unimproved land at low prices, bring water on them, and then sell in\r\nsmall lots. But this will come to an end. The tendency is to subdivide\r\nthe land into small holdings--into farms and gardens of ten and twenty\r\nacres. The great ranches are sure to be broken up. With the resulting\r\nsettlement by industrious people the cities will again experience\r\n\"booms;\" but these are not peculiar to California. In my mind I see the\r\ntime when this region (because it will pay better proportionally to\r\ncultivate a small area) will be one of small farms, of neat cottages, of\r\nindustrious homes. The owner is pretty certain to prosper--that is, to\r\nget a good living (which is independence), and lay aside a little\r\nyearly--if the work is done by himself and his family. And the\r\npeculiarity of the situation is that the farm or garden, whichever it is\r\ncalled, will give agreeable and most healthful occupation to all the\r\nboys and girls in the family all the days in the year that can be spared\r\nfrom the school. Aside from the ploughing, the labor is light. Pruning,\r\ngrafting, budding, the picking of the grapes, the gathering of the fruit\r\nfrom the trees, the sorting, packing, and canning, are labor for light\r\nand deft hands, and labor distributed through the year. The harvest, of\r\none sort and another, is almost continuous, so that young girls and boys\r\ncan have, in well-settled districts, pretty steady employment--a long\r\nseason in establishments packing oranges; at another time, in canning\r\nfruits; at another, in packing raisins.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that in the industries now developed, and in\r\nothers as important which are in their infancy (for instance, the\r\nculture of the olive for oil and as an article of food; the growth and\r\ncuring of figs; the gathering of almonds, English walnuts, etc.), the\r\nlabor of the owners of the land and their families will not suffice.\r\nThere must be as large a proportion of day-laborers as there are in\r\nother regions where such products are grown. Chinese labor at certain\r\nseasons has been a necessity. Under the present policy of California\r\nthis must diminish, and its place be taken by some other. The pay for\r\nthis labor has always been good. It is certain to be more and more in\r\ndemand. Whether the pay will ever approach near to the European standard\r\nis a question, but it is a fair presumption that the exceptional profit\r\nof the land, owing to its productiveness, will for a long time keep\r\nwages up.\r\n\r\nDuring the \"boom\" period all wages were high, those of skilled mechanics\r\nespecially, owing to the great amount of building on speculation. The\r\nordinary laborer on a ranch had $30 a month and board and lodging;\r\nlaborers of a higher grade, $2 to $2 50 a day; skilled masons, $6;\r\ncarpenters, from $3 50 to $5; plasterers, $4 to $5; house-servants, from\r\n$23 to $33 a month. Since the \"boom,\" wages of skilled mechanics have\r\ndeclined at least 25 per cent., and there has been less demand for labor\r\ngenerally, except in connection with fruit raising and harvesting. It\r\nwould be unwise for laborers to go to California on an uncertainty, but\r\nit can be said of that country with more confidence than of any other\r\nsection that its peculiar industries, now daily increasing, will absorb\r\nan increasing amount of day labor, and later on it will remunerate\r\nskilled artisan labor.\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether Southern California would be an agreeable place of\r\nresidence there are other things to be considered besides the\r\nproductiveness of the soil, the variety of products, the ease of\r\nout-door labor distributed through the year, the certainty of returns\r\nfor intelligent investment with labor, the equability of summer and\r\nwinter, and the adaptation to personal health. There are always\r\ndisadvantages attending the development of a new country and the\r\nevolution of a new society. It is not a small thing, and may be one of\r\ndaily discontent, the change from a landscape clad with verdure, the\r\nriotous and irrepressible growth of a rainy region, to a land that the\r\ngreater part of the year is green only where it is artificially watered,\r\nwhere all the hills and unwatered plains are brown and sere, where the\r\nfoliage is coated with dust, and where driving anywhere outside the\r\nsprinkled avenues of a town is to be enveloped in a cloud of powdered\r\nearth. This discomfort must be weighed against the commercial advantages\r\nof a land of irrigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GARDEN SCENE, SANTA ANA.]\r\n\r\nWhat are the chances for a family of very moderate means to obtain a\r\nfoothold and thrive by farming in Southern California? I cannot answer\r\nthis better than by giving substantially the experience of one family,\r\nand by saying that this has been paralleled, with change of details, by\r\nmany others. Of course, in a highly developed settlement, where the land\r\nis mostly cultivated, and its actual yearly produce makes its price very\r\nhigh, it is not easy to get a foothold. But there are many regions--say\r\nin Orange County, and certainly in San Diego--where land can be had at a\r\nmoderate price and on easy terms of payment. Indeed, there are few\r\nplaces, as I have said, where an industrious family would not find\r\nwelcome and cordial help in establishing itself. And it must be\r\nremembered that there are many communities where life is very simple,\r\nand the great expense of keeping up an appearance attending life\r\nelsewhere need not be reckoned.\r\n\r\nA few years ago a professional man in a New England city, who was in\r\ndelicate health, with his wife and five boys, all under sixteen, and one\r\ntoo young to be of any service, moved to San Diego. He had in money a\r\nsmall sum, less than a thousand dollars. He had no experience in farming\r\nor horticulture, and his health would not have permitted him to do much\r\nfield work in our climate. Fortunately he found in the fertile El Cajon\r\nValley, fifteen miles from San Diego, a farmer and fruit-grower, who had\r\nupon his place a small unoccupied house. Into that house he moved,\r\nfurnishing it very simply with furniture bought in San Diego, and hired\r\nhis services to the landlord. The work required was comparatively easy,\r\nin the orchard and vineyards, and consisted largely in superintending\r\nother laborers. The pay was about enough to support his family without\r\nencroaching on his little capital. Very soon, however, he made an\r\narrangement to buy the small house and tract of some twenty acres on\r\nwhich he lived, on time, perhaps making a partial payment. He began at\r\nonce to put out an orange orchard and plant a vineyard; this he\r\naccomplished with the assistance of his boys, who did practically most\r\nof the work after the first planting, leaving him a chance to give most\r\nof his days to his employer. The orchard and vineyard work is so light\r\nthat a smart, intelligent boy is almost as valuable a worker in the\r\nfield as a man. The wife, meantime, kept the house and did its work.\r\nHouse-keeping was comparatively easy; little fuel was required except\r\nfor cooking; the question of clothes was a minor one. In that climate\r\nwants for a fairly comfortable existence are fewer than with us. From\r\nthe first, almost, vegetables, raised upon the ground while the vines\r\nand oranges were growing, contributed largely to the support of the\r\nfamily. The out-door life and freedom from worry insured better health,\r\nand the diet of fruit and vegetables, suitable to the climate, reduced\r\nthe cost of living to a minimum. As soon as the orchard and the vineyard\r\nbegan to produce fruit, the owner was enabled to quit working for his\r\nneighbor, and give all his time to the development of his own place. He\r\nincreased his planting; he added to his house; he bought a piece of land\r\nadjoining which had a grove of eucalyptus, which would supply him with\r\nfuel. At first the society circle was small, and there was no school;\r\nbut the incoming of families had increased the number of children, so\r\nthat an excellent public school was established. When I saw him he was\r\nliving in conditions of comfortable industry; his land had trebled in\r\nvalue; the pair of horses which he drove he had bought cheap, for they\r\nwere Eastern horses; but the climate had brought them up, so that the\r\nteam was a serviceable one in good condition. The story is not one of\r\nbrilliant success, but to me it is much more hopeful for the country\r\nthan the other tales I heard of sudden wealth or lucky speculation. It\r\nis the founding in an unambitious way of a comfortable home. The boys of\r\nthe family will branch out, get fields, orchards, vineyards of their\r\nown, and add to the solid producing industry of the country. This\r\norderly, contented industry, increasing its gains day by day, little by\r\nlittle, is the life and hope of any State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSOME DETAILS OF THE WONDERFUL DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this volume to describe Southern California.\r\nThat has been thoroughly done; and details, with figures and pictures in\r\nregard to every town and settlement, will be forthcoming on application,\r\nwhich will be helpful guides to persons who can see for themselves, or\r\nmake sufficient allowance for local enthusiasm. But before speaking\r\nfurther of certain industries south of the great mountain ranges, the\r\nregion north of the Sierra Madre, which is allied to Southern California\r\nby its productions, should be mentioned. The beautiful antelope plains\r\nand the Kern Valley (where land is still cheap and very productive)\r\nshould not be overlooked. The splendid San Joaquin Valley is already\r\nspeaking loudly and clearly for itself. The region north of the\r\nmountains of Kern County, shut in by the Sierra Nevada range on the east\r\nand the Coast Range on the west, substantially one valley, fifty to\r\nsixty miles in breadth, watered by the King and the San Joaquin, and\r\ngently sloping to the north, say for two hundred miles, is a land of\r\nmarvellous capacity, capable of sustaining a dense population. It is\r\ncooler in winter than Southern California, and the summers average much\r\nwarmer. Owing to the greater heat, the fruits mature sooner. It is just\r\nnow becoming celebrated for its raisins, which in quality are\r\nunexcelled; and its area, which can be well irrigated from the rivers\r\nand from the mountains on either side, seems capable of producing\r\nraisins enough to supply the world. It is a wonderfully rich valley in a\r\ngreat variety of products. Fresno County, which occupies the centre of\r\nthis valley, has 1,200,000 acres of agricultural and 4,400,000 of\r\nmountain and pasture land. The city of Fresno, which occupies land that\r\nin 1870 was a sheep ranch, is the commercial centre of a beautiful\r\nagricultural and fruit region, and has a population estimated at 12,000.\r\nFrom this centre were shipped in the season of 1890, 1500 car-loads of\r\nraisins. In 1865 the only exports of Fresno County were a few bales of\r\nwool. The report of 1889 gave a shipment of 700,000 boxes of raisins,\r\nand the whole export of 1890, of all products, was estimated at\r\n$10,000,000. Whether these figures are exact or not, there is no doubt\r\nof the extraordinary success of the raisin industry, nor that this is a\r\nregion of great activity and promise.\r\n\r\nThe traveller has constantly to remind himself that this is a new\r\ncountry, and to be judged as a new country. It is out of his experience\r\nthat trees can grow so fast, and plantations in so short a time put on\r\nan appearance of maturity. When he sees a roomy, pretty cottage overrun\r\nwith vines and flowering plants, set in the midst of trees and lawns and\r\ngardens of tropical appearance and luxuriance, he can hardly believe\r\nthat three years before this spot was desert land. When he looks over\r\nmiles of vineyards, of groves of oranges, olives, walnuts, prunes, the\r\ntrees all in vigorous bearing, he cannot believe that five or ten years\r\nbefore the whole region was a waste. When he enters a handsome village,\r\nwith substantial buildings of brick, and perhaps of stone, with fine\r\nschool-houses, banks, hotels, an opera-house, large packing-houses, and\r\nwarehouses and shops of all sorts, with tasteful dwellings and lovely\r\nornamented lawns, it is hard to understand that all this is the creation\r\nof two or three years. Yet these surprises meet the traveller at every\r\nturn, and the wonder is that there is not visible more crudeness,\r\neccentric taste, and evidence of hasty beginnings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GRAPE-VINE, MONTECITO VALLEY, SANTA BARBARA.]\r\n\r\nSan Bernardino is comparatively an old town. It was settled in 1853 by\r\na colony of Mormons from Salt Lake. The remains of this colony, less\r\nthan a hundred, still live here, and have a church like the other sects,\r\nbut they call themselves Josephites, and do not practise polygamy. There\r\nis probably not a sect or schism in the United States that has not its\r\nrepresentative in California. Until 1865 San Bernardino was merely a\r\nstraggling settlement, and a point of distribution for Arizona. The\r\ndiscovery that a large part of the county was adapted to the orange and\r\nthe vine, and the advent of the Santa Fé railway, changed all that. Land\r\nthat then might have been bought for $4 an acre is now sold at from $200\r\nto $300, and the city has become the busy commercial centre of a large\r\nnumber of growing villages, and of one of the most remarkable orange and\r\nvine districts in the world. It has many fine buildings, a population of\r\nabout 6000, and a decided air of vigorous business. The great plain\r\nabout it is mainly devoted to agricultural products, which are grown\r\nwithout irrigation, while in the near foot-hills the orange and the vine\r\nflourish by the aid of irrigation. Artesian-wells abound in the San\r\nBernardino plain, but the mountains are the great and unfailing source\r\nof water supply. The Bear Valley Dam is a most daring and gigantic\r\nconstruction. A solid wall of masonry, 300 feet long and 60 feet high,\r\ncurving towards the reservoir, creates an inland lake in the mountains\r\nholding water enough to irrigate 20,000 acres of land. This is conveyed\r\nto distributing reservoirs in the east end of the valley. On a terrace\r\nin the foot-hills a few miles to the north, 2000 feet above the sea, are\r\nthe Arrow-head Hot Springs (named from the figure of a gigantic\r\n\"arrow-head\" on the mountain above), already a favorite resort for\r\nhealth and pleasure. The views from the plain of the picturesque\r\nfoot-hills and the snow-peaks of the San Bernardino range are\r\nexceedingly fine. The marvellous beauty of the purple and deep violet of\r\nthe giant hills at sunset, with spotless snow, lingers in the memory.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the settlement of Redlands, ten miles by rail east of San\r\nBernardino, is as good an illustration as any of rapid development and\r\ngreat promise. It is devoted to the orange and the grape. As late as\r\n1875 much of it was Government land, considered valueless. It had a few\r\nsettlers, but the town, which counts now about 2000 people, was only\r\nbegun in 1887. It has many solid brick edifices and many pretty cottages\r\non its gentle slopes and rounded hills, overlooked by the great\r\nmountains. The view from any point of vantage of orchards and vineyards\r\nand semi-tropical gardens, with the wide sky-line of noble and snow-clad\r\nhills, is exceedingly attractive. The region is watered by the Santa Ana\r\nRiver and Mill Creek, but the main irrigating streams, which make every\r\nhill-top to bloom with vegetation, come from the Bear Valley Reservoir.\r\nOn a hill to the south of the town the Smiley Brothers, of Catskill\r\nfame, are building fine residences, and planting their 125 acres with\r\nfruit-trees and vines, evergreens, flowers, and semi-tropic shrubbery in\r\na style of landscape-gardening that in three years at the furthest will\r\nmake this spot one of the few great showplaces of the country. Behind\r\ntheir ridge is the San Mateo Cañon, through which the Southern Pacific\r\nRailway runs, while in front are the splendid sloping plains, valleys,\r\nand orange groves, and the great sweep of mountains from San Jacinto\r\nround to the Sierra Madre range. It is almost a matchless prospect. The\r\nclimate is most agreeable, the plantations increase month by month, and\r\nthus far the orange-trees have not been visited by the scale, nor the\r\nvines by any sickness. Although the groves are still young, there were\r\nshipped from Redlands in the season of 1889-90 80 car-loads of oranges,\r\nof 286 boxes to the car, at a price averaging nearly $1000 a car. That\r\nseason's planting of oranges was over 1200 acres. It had over 5000 acres\r\nin fruits, of which nearly 3000 were in peaches, apricots, grapes, and\r\nother sorts called deciduous.\r\n\r\nRiverside may without prejudice be regarded as the centre of the orange\r\ngrowth and trade. The railway shipments of oranges from Southern\r\nCalifornia in the season of 1890 aggregated about 2400 car-loads, or\r\nabout 800,000 boxes, of oranges (in which estimate the lemons are\r\nincluded), valued at about $1,500,000. Of this shipment more than half\r\nwas from Riverside. This has been, of course, greatly stimulated by the\r\nimproved railroad facilities, among them the shortening of the time to\r\nChicago by the Santa Fé route, and the running of special fruit trains.\r\nSouthern California responds like magic to this chance to send her\r\nfruits to the East, and the area planted month by month is something\r\nenormous. It is estimated that the crop of oranges alone in 1891 will be\r\nover 4500 car-loads. We are accustomed to discount all California\r\nestimates, but I think that no one yet has comprehended the amount to\r\nwhich the shipments to Eastern markets of vegetables and fresh and\r\ncanned fruits will reach within five years. I base my prediction upon\r\nsome observation of the Eastern demand and the reports of\r\nfruit-dealers, upon what I saw of the new planting all over the State in\r\n1890, and upon the statistics of increase. Take Riverside as an example.\r\nIn 1872 it was a poor sheep ranch. In 1880-81 it shipped 15 car-loads,\r\nor 4290 boxes, of oranges; the amount yearly increased, until in 1888-89\r\nit was 925 car-loads, or 263,879 boxes. In 1890 it rose to 1253\r\ncar-loads, or 358,341 boxes; and an important fact is that the largest\r\nshipment was in April (455 car-loads, or 130,226 boxes), at the time\r\nwhen the supply from other orange regions for the markets East had\r\nnearly ceased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRRIGATING AN ORCHARD.]\r\n\r\nIt should be said, also, that the quality of the oranges has vastly\r\nimproved. This is owing to better cultivation, knowledge of proper\r\nirrigation, and the adoption of the best varieties for the soil. As\r\ndifferent sorts of oranges mature at different seasons, a variety is\r\nneeded to give edible fruit in each month from December to May\r\ninclusive. In February, 1887, I could not find an orange of the first\r\nclass compared with the best fruit in other regions. It may have been\r\ntoo early for the varieties I tried; but I believe there has been a\r\nmarked improvement in quality. In May, 1890, we found delicious oranges\r\nalmost everywhere. The seedless Washington and Australian navels are\r\nfavorites, especially for the market, on account of their great size and\r\nfine color. When in perfection they are very fine, but the skin is thick\r\nand the texture coarser than that of some others. The best orange I\r\nhappened to taste was a Tahiti seedling at Montecito (Santa Barbara). It\r\nis a small orange, with a thin skin and a compact, sweet pulp that\r\nleaves little fibre. It resembles the famous orange of Malta. But there\r\nare many excellent varieties--the Mediterranean sweet, the paper rind\r\nSt. Michael, the Maltese blood, etc. The experiments with seedlings are\r\nprofitable, and will give ever new varieties. I noted that the \"grape\r\nfruit,\" which is becoming so much liked in the East, is not appreciated\r\nin California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORANGE CULTURE. Packing Oranges--Navel Orange-tree Six\r\nYears Old--Irrigating an Orange Grove.]\r\n\r\nThe city of Riverside occupies an area of some five miles by three, and\r\nclaims to have 6000 inhabitants; the centre is a substantial town with\r\nfine school and other public buildings, but the region is one succession\r\nof orange groves and vineyards, of comfortable houses and broad avenues.\r\nOne avenue through which we drove is 125 feet wide and 12 miles long,\r\nplanted in three rows with palms, magnolias, the _Grevillea robusta_\r\n(Australian fern), the pepper, and the eucalyptus, and lined all the way\r\nby splendid orange groves, in the midst of which are houses and grounds\r\nwith semi-tropical attractions. Nothing could be lovelier than such a\r\nscene of fruits and flowers, with the background of purple hills and\r\nsnowy peaks. The mountain views are superb. Frost is a rare visitor. Not\r\nin fifteen years has there been enough to affect the orange. There is\r\nlittle rain after March, but there are fogs and dew-falls, and the ocean\r\nbreeze is felt daily. The grape grown for raisins is the muscat, and\r\nthis has had no \"sickness.\" Vigilance and a quarantine have also kept\r\nfrom the orange the scale which has been so annoying in some other\r\nlocalities. The orange, when cared for, is a generous bearer; some trees\r\nproduce twenty boxes each, and there are areas of twenty acres in good\r\nbearing which have brought to the owner as much as $10,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThe whole region of the Santa Ana and San Gabriel valleys, from the\r\ndesert on the east to Los Angeles, the city of gardens, is a surprise,\r\nand year by year an increasing wonder. In production it exhausts the\r\ncatalogue of fruits and flowers; its scenery is varied by ever new\r\ncombinations of the picturesque and the luxuriant; every town boasts\r\nsome special advantage in climate, soil, water, or society; but these\r\ndifferences, many of them visible to the eye, cannot appear in any\r\nwritten description. The traveller may prefer the scenery of Pasadena,\r\nor that of Pomona, or of Riverside, but the same words in regard to\r\ncolor, fertility, combinations of orchards, avenues, hills, must appear\r\nin the description of each. Ontario, Pomona, Puente, Alhambra--wherever\r\none goes there is the same wonder of color and production.\r\n\r\nPomona is a pleasant city in the midst of fine orange groves, watered\r\nabundantly by artesian-wells and irrigating ditches from a mountain\r\nreservoir. A specimen of the ancient adobe residence is on the Meserve\r\nplantation, a lovely old place, with its gardens of cherries,\r\nstrawberries, olives, and oranges. From the top of San José hill we had\r\na view of a plain twenty-five miles by fifty in extent, dotted with\r\ncultivation, surrounded by mountains--a wonderful prospect. Pomona, like\r\nits sister cities in this region, has a regard for the intellectual side\r\nof life, exhibited in good school-houses and public libraries. In the\r\nlibrary of Pomona is what may be regarded as the tutelary deity of the\r\nplace--the goddess Pomona, a good copy in marble of the famous statue in\r\nthe Uffizi Gallery, presented to the city by the Rev. C. F. Loop. This\r\nenterprising citizen is making valuable experiments in olive culture,\r\nraising a dozen varieties in order to ascertain which is best adapted to\r\nthis soil, and which will make the best return in oil and in a\r\nmarketable product of cured fruit for the table.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the olive is to be, it seems to me, one of the leading and\r\nmost permanent industries of Southern California. It will give us, what\r\nit is nearly impossible to buy now, pure olive oil, in place of the\r\ncotton-seed and lard mixture in general use. It is a most wholesome and\r\npalatable article of food. Those whose chief experience of the olive is\r\nthe large, coarse, and not agreeable Spanish variety, used only as an\r\nappetizer, know little of the value of the best varieties as food,\r\nnutritious as meat, and always delicious. Good bread and a dish of\r\npickled olives make an excellent meal. The sort known as the Mission\r\nolive, planted by the Franciscans a century ago, is generally grown now,\r\nand the best fruit is from the older trees. The most successful attempts\r\nin cultivating the olive and putting it on the market have been made by\r\nMr. F. A. Kimball, of National City, and Mr. Ellwood Cooper, of Santa\r\nBarbara. The experiments have gone far enough to show that the industry\r\nis very remunerative. The best olive oil I have ever tasted anywhere is\r\nthat produced from the Cooper and the Kimball orchards; but not enough\r\nis produced to supply the local demand. Mr. Cooper has written a careful\r\ntreatise on olive culture, which will be of great service to all\r\ngrowers. The art of pickling is not yet mastered, and perhaps some other\r\nvariety will be preferred to the old Mission for the table. A mature\r\nolive grove in good bearing is a fortune. I feel sure that within\r\ntwenty-five years this will be one of the most profitable industries of\r\nCalifornia, and that the demand for pure oil and edible fruit in the\r\nUnited States will drive out the adulterated and inferior present\r\ncommercial products. But California can easily ruin its reputation by\r\nadopting the European systems of adulteration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN A FIELD OF GOLDEN PUMPKINS.]\r\n\r\nWe drove one day from Arcadia Station through the region occupied by\r\nthe Baldwin plantations, an area of over fifty thousand acres--a happy\r\nillustration of what industry and capital can do in the way of variety\r\nof productions, especially in what are called the San Anita vineyards\r\nand orchards, extending southward from the foot-hills. About the home\r\nplace and in many sections where the irrigating streams flow one might\r\nfancy he was in the tropics, so abundant and brilliant are the flowers\r\nand exotic plants. There are splendid orchards of oranges, almonds,\r\nEnglish walnuts, lemons, peaches, apricots, figs, apples, and olives,\r\nwith grain and corn--in short, everything that grows in garden or field.\r\nThe ranch is famous for its brandies and wines as well as fruits. We\r\nlunched at the East San Gabriel Hotel, a charming place with a peaceful\r\nview from the wide veranda of live-oaks, orchards, vineyards, and the\r\nnoble Sierra Madre range. The Californians may be excused for using the\r\nterm paradisiacal about such scenes. Flowers, flowers everywhere, color\r\non color, and the song of the mocking-bird!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE FRUIT PERILS WERE MET.--FURTHER DETAILS OF LOCALITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the San Gabriel Valley and elsewhere I saw evidence of the perils\r\nthat attend the culture of the vine and the fruit-tree in all other\r\ncountries, and from which California in the early days thought it was\r\nexempt. Within the past three or four years there has prevailed a\r\nsickness of the vine, the cause of which is unknown, and for which no\r\nremedy has been discovered. No blight was apparent, but the vine\r\nsickened and failed. The disease was called consumption of the vine. I\r\nsaw many vineyards subject to it, and hundreds of acres of old vines had\r\nbeen rooted up as useless. I was told by a fruit-buyer in Los Angeles\r\nthat he thought the raisin industry below Fresno was ended unless new\r\nplanting recovered the vines, and that the great wine fields were about\r\n\"played out.\" The truth I believe to be that the disease is confined to\r\nthe vineyards of Old Mission grapes. Whether these had attained the\r\nlimit of their active life, and sickened, I do not know. The trouble for\r\na time was alarming; but new plantings of other varieties of grapes have\r\nbeen successful, the vineyards look healthful, and the growers expect no\r\nfurther difficulty. The planting, which was for a time suspended, has\r\nbeen more vigorously renewed.\r\n\r\nThe insect pests attacking the orange were even more serious, and in\r\n1887-88, though little was published about it, there was something like\r\na panic, in the fear that the orange and lemon culture in Southern\r\nCalifornia would be a failure. The enemies were the black, the red, and\r\nthe white scale. The latter, the _icerya purchasi_, or cottony cushion\r\nscale, was especially loathsome and destructive; whole orchards were\r\nenfeebled, and no way was discovered of staying its progress, which\r\nthreatened also the olive and every other tree, shrub, and flower.\r\nScience was called on to discover its parasite. This was found to be the\r\nAustralian lady-bug (_vedolia cardinalis_), and in 1888-89 quantities of\r\nthis insect were imported and spread throughout Los Angeles County, and\r\nsent to Santa Barbara and other afflicted districts. The effect was\r\nmagical. The _vedolia_ attacked the cottony scale with intense vigor,\r\nand everywhere killed it. The orchards revived as if they had been\r\nrecreated, and the danger was over. The enemies of the black and the red\r\nscale have not yet been discovered, but they probably will be. Meantime\r\nthe growers have recovered courage, and are fertilizing and fumigating.\r\nIn Santa Ana I found that the red scale was fought successfully by\r\nfumigating the trees. The operation is performed at night under a\r\nmovable tent, which covers the tree. The cost is about twenty cents a\r\ntree. One lesson of all this is that trees must be fed in order to be\r\nkept vigorous to resist such attacks, and that fruit-raising,\r\nconsidering the number of enemies that all fruits have in all climates,\r\nis not an idle occupation. The clean, handsome English walnut is about\r\nthe only tree in the State that thus far has no enemy.\r\n\r\nOne cannot take anywhere else a more exhilarating, delightful drive than\r\nabout the rolling, highly cultivated, many-villaed Pasadena, and out to\r\nthe foot-hills and the Sierra Madre Villa. He is constantly exclaiming\r\nat the varied loveliness of the scene--oranges, palms, formal gardens,\r\nhedges of Monterey cypress. It is very Italy-like. The Sierra Madre\r\nfurnishes abundant water for all the valley, and the swift irrigating\r\nstream from Eaton Cañon waters the Sierra Madre Villa. Among the peaks\r\nabove it rises Mt. Wilson, a thousand feet above the plain, the site\r\nselected for the Harvard Observatory with its 40-inch glass. The\r\nclearness of the air at this elevation, and the absence of clouds night\r\nand day the greater portion of the year, make this a most advantageous\r\nposition, it is said, to use the glass in dissolving nebulæ. The Sierra\r\nMadre Villa, once the most favorite resort in this region, was closed.\r\nIn its sheltered situation, its luxuriant and half-neglected gardens,\r\nits wide plantations and irrigating streams, it reminds one of some\r\nsecularized monastery on the promontory of Sorrento. It only needs good\r\nmanagement to make the hotel very attractive and especially agreeable in\r\nthe months of winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACKING CHERRIES, POMONA.]\r\n\r\nPasadena, which exhibits everywhere evidences of wealth and culture, and\r\nclaims a permanent population of 12,000, has the air of a winter resort;\r\nthe great Hotel Raymond is closed in May, the boarding-houses want\r\noccupants, the shops and livery-stables customers, and the streets lack\r\nmovement. This is easily explained. It is not because Pasadena is not an\r\nagreeable summer residence, but because the visitors are drawn there in\r\nthe winter principally to escape the inclement climate of the North and\r\nEast, and because special efforts have been made for their entertainment\r\nin the winter. We found the atmosphere delightful in the middle of May.\r\nThe mean summer heat is 67°, and the nights are always cool. The hills\r\nnear by may be resorted to with the certainty of finding as decided a\r\nchange as one desires in the summer season. I must repeat that the\r\nSouthern California summer is not at all understood in the East. The\r\nstatement of the general equability of the temperature the year through\r\nmust be insisted on. We lunched one day in a typical California house,\r\nin the midst of a garden of fruits, flowers, and tropical shrubs; in a\r\nhouse that might be described as half roses and half tent, for added to\r\nthe wooden structure were rooms of canvas, which are used as sleeping\r\napartments winter and summer.\r\n\r\nThis attractive region, so lovely in its cultivation, with so many\r\ncharming drives, offering good shooting on the plains and in the hills,\r\nand centrally placed for excursions, is only eight miles from the busy\r\ncity of Los Angeles. An excellent point of view of the country is from\r\nthe graded hill on which stands the Raymond Hotel, a hill isolated but\r\neasy of access, which is in itself a mountain of bloom, color, and\r\nfragrance. From all the broad verandas and from every window the\r\nprospect is charming, whether the eye rests upon cultivated orchards and\r\ngardens and pretty villas, or upon the purple foot-hills and the snowy\r\nranges. It enjoys a daily ocean breeze, and the air is always\r\nexhilarating. This noble hill is a study in landscape-gardening. It is a\r\nmass of brilliant color, and the hospitality of the region generally to\r\nforeign growths may be estimated by the trees acclimated on these\r\nslopes. They are the pepper, eucalyptus, pine, cypress, sycamore,\r\nred-wood, olive, date and fan palms, banana, pomegranate, guava,\r\nJapanese persimmon, umbrella, maple, elm, locust, English walnut, birch,\r\nailantus, poplar, willow, and more ornamental shrubs than one can well\r\nname.\r\n\r\nI can indulge in few locality details except those which are\r\nillustrative of the general character of the country. In passing into\r\nOrange County, which was recently set off from Los Angeles, we come into\r\na region of less \"fashion,\" but one that for many reasons is attractive\r\nto people of moderate means who are content with independent simplicity.\r\nThe country about the thriving village of Santa Ana is very rich, being\r\nabundantly watered by the Santa Ana River and by artesian-wells. The\r\ntown is nine miles from the ocean. On the ocean side the land is mainly\r\nagricultural; on the inland side it is specially adapted to fruit. We\r\ndrove about it, and in Tustin City, which has many pleasant residences\r\nand a vacant \"boom\" hotel, through endless plantations of oranges. On\r\nthe road towards Los Angeles we passed large herds of cattle and sheep,\r\nand fine groves of the English walnut, which thrives especially well in\r\nthis soil and the neighborhood of the sea. There is comparatively little\r\nwaste land in this valley district, as one may see by driving through\r\nthe country about Santa Ana, Orange, Anaheim, Tustin City, etc. Anaheim\r\nis a prosperous German colony. It was here that Madame Modjeska and her\r\nhusband, Count Bozenta, first settled in California. They own and occupy\r\nnow a picturesque ranch in the Santiago Cañon of the Santa Ana range,\r\ntwenty-two miles from Santa Ana. This is one of the richest regions in\r\nthe State, and with its fair quota of working population, it will be one\r\nof the most productive.\r\n\r\nFrom Newport, on the coast, or from San Pedro, one may visit the island\r\nof Santa Catalina. Want of time prevented our going there. Sportsmen\r\nenjoy there the exciting pastime of hunting the wild goat. From the\r\nphotographs I saw, and from all I heard of it, it must be as picturesque\r\na resort in natural beauty as the British Channel islands.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is the metropolitan centre of all this region. A handsome,\r\nsolid, thriving city, environed by gardens, gay everywhere with flowers,\r\nit is too well known to require any description from me. To the\r\ntraveller from the East it will always be a surprise. Its growth has\r\nbeen phenomenal, and although it may not equal the expectations of the\r\ncrazy excitement of 1886-87, 50,000 people is a great assemblage for a\r\nnew city which numbered only about 11,000 in 1880. It of course felt the\r\nsubsidence of the \"boom,\" but while I missed the feverish crowds of\r\n1887, I was struck with its substantial progress in fine, solid\r\nbuildings, pavements, sewerage, railways, educational facilities, and\r\nornamental grounds. It has a secure hold on the commerce of the region.\r\nThe assessment roll of the city increased from $7,627,632 in 1881 to\r\n$44,871,073 in 1889. Its bank business, public buildings, school-houses,\r\nand street improvements are in accord with this increase, and show\r\nsolid, vigorous growth. It is altogether an attractive city, whether\r\nseen on a drive through its well-planted and bright avenues, or looked\r\ndown on from the hills which are climbed by the cable roads. A curious\r\nsocial note was the effect of the \"boom\" excitement upon the birth\r\nrate. The report of children under the age of one year was in 1887, 271\r\nboy babies and 264 girl babies; from 1887 to 1888 there were only 176\r\nboy babies and 162 girl babies. The return at the end of 1889 was 465\r\nboy babies, and 500 girl babies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVE-TREES SIX YEARS OLD.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Los Angeles County still produces a considerable quantity of\r\nwine and brandy, I have an impression that the raising of raisins will\r\nsupplant wine-making largely in Southern California, and that the\r\nprincipal wine producing will be in the northern portions of the State.\r\nIt is certain that the best quality is grown in the foot-hills. The\r\nreputation of \"California wines\" has been much injured by placing upon\r\nthe market crude juice that was in no sense wine. Great improvement has\r\nbeen made in the past three to five years, not only in the vine and\r\nknowledge of the soil adapted to it, but in the handling and the curing\r\nof the wine. One can now find without much difficulty excellent table\r\nwines--sound claret, good white Reisling, and sauterne. None of these\r\nwines are exactly like the foreign wines, and it may be some time before\r\nthe taste accustomed to foreign wines is educated to like them. But in\r\nEastern markets some of the best brands are already much called for, and\r\nI think it only a question of time and a little more experience when the\r\nbest California wines will be popular. I found in the San Francisco\r\nmarket excellent red wines at $3.50 the case, and what was still more\r\nremarkable, at some of the best hotels sound, agreeable claret at from\r\nfifteen to twenty cents the pint bottle.\r\n\r\nIt is quite unnecessary to emphasize the attractions of Santa Barbara,\r\nor the productiveness of the valleys in the counties of Santa Barbara\r\nand Ventura. There is no more poetic region on the continent than the\r\nbay south of Point Conception, and the pen and the camera have made the\r\nworld tolerably familiar with it. There is a graciousness, a softness, a\r\ncolor in the sea, the cañons, the mountains there that dwell in the\r\nmemory. It is capable of inspiring the same love that the Greek\r\ncolonists felt for the region between the bays of Salerno and Naples. It\r\nis as fruitful as the Italian shores, and can support as dense a\r\npopulation. The figures that have been given as to productiveness and\r\nvariety of productions apply to it. Having more winter rainfall than\r\nthe counties south of it, agriculture is profitable in most years. Since\r\nthe railway was made down the valley of the Santa Clara River and along\r\nthe coast to Santa Barbara, a great impulse has been given to farming.\r\nOrange and other fruit orchards have increased. Near Buenaventura I saw\r\nhundreds of acres of lima beans. The yield is about one ton to the acre.\r\nWith good farming the valleys yield crops of corn, barley, and wheat\r\nmuch above the average. Still it is a fruit region, and no variety has\r\nyet been tried that does not produce very well there. The rapid growth\r\nof all trees has enabled the region to demonstrate in a short time that\r\nthere is scarcely any that it cannot naturalize. The curious growths of\r\ntropical lands, the trees of aromatic and medicinal gums, the trees of\r\nexquisite foliage and wealth of fragrant blossoms, the sturdy forest\r\nnatives, and the bearers of edible nuts are all to be found in the\r\ngardens and by the road-side, from New England, from the Southern\r\nStates, from Europe, from North and South Africa, Southern Asia, China,\r\nJapan, from Australia and New Zealand and South America. The region is\r\nan arboreal and botanical garden on an immense scale, and full of\r\nsurprises. The floriculture is even more astonishing. Every land is\r\nrepresented. The profusion and vigor are as wonderful as the variety. At\r\na flower show in Santa Barbara were exhibited 160 varieties of roses all\r\ncut from one garden the same morning. The open garden rivals the Eastern\r\nconservatory. The country is new and many of the conditions of life may\r\nbe primitive and rude, but it is impossible that any region shall not be\r\nbeautiful, clothed with such a profusion of bloom and color.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the rapid growth. The practical advantage of this as to\r\nfruit-trees is that one begins to have an income from them here sooner\r\nthan in the East. No one need be under the delusion that he can live in\r\nCalifornia without work, or thrive without incessant and intelligent\r\nindustry, but the distinction of the country for the fruit-grower is the\r\nrapidity with which trees and vines mature to the extent of being\r\nprofitable. But nothing thrives without care, and kindly as the climate\r\nis to the weak, it cannot be too much insisted on that this is no place\r\nfor confirmed invalids who have not money enough to live without work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANCE OF CULTIVATION SOUTHWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immense county of San Diego is on the threshold of its development.\r\nIt has comparatively only spots of cultivation here and there, in an\r\narea on the western slope of the county only, that Mr. Van Dyke\r\nestimates to contain about one million acres of good arable land for\r\nfarming and fruit-raising. This mountainous region is full of charming\r\nvalleys, and hidden among the hills are fruitful nooks capable of\r\nsustaining thriving communities. There is no doubt about the salubrity\r\nof the climate, and one can literally suit himself as to temperature by\r\nchoosing his elevation. The traveller by rail down the wild Temecula\r\nCañon will have some idea of the picturesqueness of the country, and, as\r\nhe descends in the broadening valley, of the beautiful mountain parks of\r\nlive-oak and clear running water, and of the richness both for grazing\r\nand grain of the ranches of the Santa Margarita, Las Flores, and Santa\r\nRosa. Or if he will see what a few years of vigorous cultivation will\r\ndo, he may visit Escondido, on the river of that name, which is at an\r\nelevation of less than a thousand feet, and fourteen miles from the\r\nocean. This is only one of many settlements that have great natural\r\nbeauty and thrifty industrial life. In that region are numerous\r\nattractive villages. I have a report from a little cañon, a few miles\r\nnorth of Escondido, where a woman with an invalid husband settled in\r\n1883. The ground was thickly covered with brush, and its only product\r\nwas rabbits and quails. In 1888 they had 100 acres cleared and fenced,\r\nmostly devoted to orchard fruits and berries. They had in good bearing\r\nover 1200 fruit-trees among them 200 oranges and 283 figs, which yielded\r\none and a half tons of figs a week during the bearing season, from\r\nAugust to November. The sprouts of the peach-trees grew twelve feet in\r\n1889. Of course such a little fruit farm as this is the result of\r\nself-denial and hard work, but I am sure that the experiment in this\r\nregion need not be exceptional.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEXTON NURSERIES, NEAR SANTA BARBARA.]\r\n\r\nSan Diego will be to the southern part of the State what San Francisco\r\nis to the northern. Nature seems to have arranged for this, by providing\r\na magnificent harbor, when it shut off the southern part by a mountain\r\nrange. During the town-lot lunacy it was said that San Diego could not\r\ngrow because it had no back country, and the retort was that it needed\r\nno back country, its harbor would command commerce. The fallacy of this\r\nassumption lay in the forgetfulness of the fact that the profitable and\r\npeculiar exports of Southern California must go East by rail, and reach\r\na market in the shortest possible time, and that the inhabitants look to\r\nthe Pacific for comparatively little of the imports they need. If the\r\nIsthmus route were opened by a ship-canal, San Diego would doubtless\r\nhave a great share of the Pacific trade, and when the population of that\r\npart of the State is large enough to demand great importations from the\r\nislands and lands of the Pacific, this harbor will not go begging. But\r\nin its present development the entire Pacific trade of Japan, China, and\r\nthe islands, gives only a small dividend each to the competing ports.\r\nFor these developments this fine harbor must wait, but meantime the\r\nwealth and prosperity of San Diego lie at its doors. A country as large\r\nas the three richest New England States, with enormous wealth of mineral\r\nand stone in its mountains, with one of the finest climates in the\r\nworld, with a million acres of arable land, is certainly capable of\r\nbuilding up one great seaport town. These million of acres on the\r\nwestern slope of the mountain ranges of the country are geographically\r\ntributary to San Diego, and almost every acre by its products is\r\ncertain to attain a high value.\r\n\r\nThe end of the ridiculous speculation in lots of 1887-88 was not so\r\ndisastrous in the loss of money invested, or even in the ruin of great\r\nexpectations by the collapse of fictitious values, as in the stoppage of\r\nimmigration. The country has been ever since adjusting itself to a\r\nnormal growth, and the recovery is just in proportion to the arrival of\r\nsettlers who come to work and not to speculate. I had heard that the\r\n\"boom\" had left San Diego and vicinity the \"deadest\" region to be found\r\nanywhere. A speculator would probably so regard it. But the people have\r\nhad a great accession of common-sense. The expectation of attracting\r\nsettlers by a fictitious show has subsided, and attention is directed to\r\nthe development of the natural riches of the country. Since the boom San\r\nDiego has perfected a splendid system of drainage, paved its streets,\r\nextended its railways, built up the business part of the town solidly\r\nand handsomely, and greatly improved the mesa above the town. In all\r\nessentials of permanent growth it is much better in appearance than in\r\n1887. Business is better organized, and, best of all, there is an\r\nintelligent appreciation of the agricultural resources of the country.\r\nIt is discovered that San Diego has a \"back country\" capable of\r\nproducing great wealth. The Chamber of Commerce has organized a\r\npermanent exhibition of products. It is assisted in this work of\r\nstimulation by competition by a \"Ladies' Annex,\" a society numbering\r\nsome five hundred ladies, who devote themselves not to æsthetic\r\npursuits, but to the quickening of all the industries of the farm and\r\nthe garden, and all public improvements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWEETWATER DAM.]\r\n\r\nTo the mere traveller who devotes only a couple of weeks to an\r\nexamination of this region it is evident that the spirit of industry is\r\nin the ascendant, and the result is a most gratifying increase in\r\norchards and vineyards, and the storage and distribution of water for\r\nirrigation. The region is unsurpassed for the production of the orange,\r\nthe lemon, the raisin-grape, the fig, and the olive. The great reservoir\r\nof the Cuyamaca, which supplies San Diego, sends its flume around the\r\nfertile valley of El Cajon (which has already a great reputation for its\r\nraisins), and this has become a garden, the land rising in value every\r\nyear. The region of National City and Chula Vista is supplied by the\r\nreservoir made by the great Sweetwater Dam--a marvel of engineering\r\nskill--and is not only most productive in fruit, but is attractive by\r\npretty villas and most sightly and agreeable homes. It is an\r\nunanswerable reply to the inquiry if this region was not killed by the\r\nboom that all the arable land, except that staked out for fancy city\r\nprices, has steadily risen in value. This is true of all the bay region\r\ndown through Otay (where a promising watch factory is established) to\r\nthe border at Tia Juana. The rate of settlement in the county outside of\r\nthe cities and towns has been greater since the boom than before--a most\r\nhealthful indication for the future. According to the school census of\r\n1889, Mr. Van Dyke estimates a permanent growth of nearly 50,000 people\r\nin the county in four years. Half of these are well distributed in small\r\nsettlements which have the advantages of roads, mails, and\r\nschool-houses, and which offer to settlers who wish to work adjacent\r\nunimproved land at prices which experience shows are still moderate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nA LAND OF AGREEABLE HOMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this imperfect conspectus of a vast territory I should be sorry to\r\nsay anything that can raise false expectations. Our country is very big;\r\nand though scarcely any part of it has not some advantages, and\r\nnotwithstanding the census figures of our population, it will be a long\r\ntime before our vast territory will fill up. California must wait with\r\nthe rest; but it seems to me to have a great future. Its position in the\r\nUnion with regard to its peculiar productions is unique. It can and will\r\nsupply us with much that we now import, and labor and capital sooner or\r\nlater will find their profit in meeting the growing demand for\r\nCalifornia products.\r\n\r\nThere are many people in the United States who could prolong life by\r\nmoving to Southern California; there are many who would find life easier\r\nthere by reason of the climate, and because out-door labor is more\r\nagreeable there the year through; many who have to fight the weather and\r\na niggardly soil for existence could there have pretty little homes with\r\nless expense of money and labor. It is well that people for whom this is\r\ntrue should know it. It need not influence those who are already well\r\nplaced to try the fortune of a distant country and new associations.\r\n\r\nI need not emphasize the disadvantage in regard to beauty of a land\r\nthat can for half the year only keep a vernal appearance by irrigation;\r\nbut to eyes accustomed to it there is something pleasing in the contrast\r\nof the green valleys with the brown and gold and red of the hills. The\r\npicture in my mind for the future of the Land of the Sun, of the\r\nmountains, of the sea--which is only an enlargement of the picture of\r\nthe present--is one of great beauty. The rapid growth of fruit and\r\nornamental trees and the profusion of flowers render easy the making of\r\na lovely home, however humble it may be. The nature of the\r\nindustries--requiring careful attention to a small piece of\r\nground--points to small holdings as a rule. The picture I see is of a\r\nland of small farms and gardens, highly cultivated, in all the valleys\r\nand on the foot-hills; a land, therefore, of luxuriance and great\r\nproductiveness and agreeable homes. I see everywhere the gardens, the\r\nvineyards, the orchards, with the various greens of the olive, the fig,\r\nand the orange. It is always picturesque, because the country is broken\r\nand even rugged; it is always interesting, because of the contrast with\r\nthe mountains and the desert; it has the color that makes Southern Italy\r\nso poetic. It is the fairest field for the experiment of a contented\r\ncommunity, without any poverty and without excessive wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nSOME WONDERS BY THE WAY.--YOSEMITE.--MARIPOSA TREES.--MONTEREY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to it with reluctance. I shrink from attempting to say anything\r\nabout it. If you knew that there was one spot on the earth where Nature\r\nkept her secret of secrets, the key to the action of her most gigantic\r\nand patient forces through the long eras, the marvel of constructive and\r\ndestructive energy, in features of sublimity made possible to mental\r\nendurance by the most exquisite devices of painting and sculpture, the\r\nwonder which is without parallel or comparison, would you not hesitate\r\nto approach it? Would you not wander and delay with this and that\r\nwonder, and this and that beauty and nobility of scenery, putting off\r\nthe day when the imagination, which is our highest gift, must be\r\nextinguished by the reality? The mind has this judicious timidity. Do we\r\nnot loiter in the avenue of the temple, dallying with the vista of giant\r\nplane-trees and statues, and noting the carving and the color, mentally\r\nshrinking from the moment when the full glory shall burst upon us? We\r\nturn and look when we are near a summit, we pick a flower, we note the\r\nshape of the clouds, the passing breeze, before we take the last step\r\nthat shall reveal to us the vast panorama of mountains and valleys.\r\n\r\nI cannot bring myself to any description of the Grand Cañon of the\r\nColorado by any other route, mental or physical, than that by which we\r\nreached it, by the way of such beauty as Monterey, such a wonder as the\r\nYosemite, and the infinite and picturesque deserts of New Mexico and\r\nArizona. I think the mind needs the training in the desert scenery to\r\nenable it to grasp the unique sublimity of the Grand Cañon.\r\n\r\nThe road to the Yosemite, after leaving the branch of the Southern\r\nPacific at Raymond, is an unnecessarily fatiguing one. The journey by\r\nstage--sixty-five miles--is accomplished in less than two\r\ndays--thirty-nine miles the first day, and twenty-six the second. The\r\ndriving is necessarily slow, because two mountain ridges have to be\r\nsurmounted, at an elevation each of about 6500 feet. The road is not a\r\n\"road\" at all as the term is understood in Switzerland, Spain, or in any\r\nhighly civilized region--that is, a graded, smooth, hard, and\r\nsufficiently broad track. It is a makeshift highway, generally narrow\r\n(often too narrow for two teams to pass), cast up with loose material,\r\nor excavated on the slopes with frequent short curves and double curves.\r\nLike all mountain roads which skirt precipices, it may seem \"pokerish,\"\r\nbut it is safe enough if the drivers are skilful and careful (all the\r\ndrivers on this route are not only excellent, but exceedingly civil as\r\nwell), and there is no break in wagon or harness. At the season this\r\ntrip is made the weather is apt to be warm, but this would not matter so\r\nmuch if the road were not intolerably dusty. Over a great part of the\r\nway the dust rises in clouds and is stifling. On a well-engineered road,\r\nwith a good road-bed, the time of passage might not be shortened, but\r\nthe journey would be made with positive comfort and enjoyment, for\r\nthough there is a certain monotony in the scenery, there is the wild\r\nfreshness of nature, now and then an extensive prospect, a sight of the\r\nsnow-clad Nevadas, and vast stretches of woodland; and a part of the way\r\nthe forests are magnificent, especially the stupendous growth of the\r\nsugar-pine. These noble forests are now protected by their\r\ninaccessibility.\r\n\r\nFrom 1855 to 1864, nine years, the Yosemite had 653 visitors; in 1864\r\nthere were 147. The number increased steadily till 1869, the year the\r\noverland railroad was completed, when it jumped to 1122. Between 4000\r\nand 5000 persons visit it now each year. The number would be enormously\r\nincreased if it could be reached by rail, and doubtless a road will be\r\nbuilt to the valley in the near future, perhaps up the Merced River. I\r\nbelieve that the pilgrims who used to go to the Yosemite on foot or on\r\nhorseback regret the building of the stage road, the enjoyment of the\r\nwonderful valley being somehow cheapened by the comparative ease of\r\nreaching it. It is feared that a railway would still further cheapen, if\r\nit did not vulgarize it, and that passengers by train would miss the\r\nmountain scenery, the splendid forests, the surprises of the way (like\r\nthe first view of the valley from Inspiration Point), and that the\r\nMariposa big trees would be farther off the route than they are now. The\r\ntraveller sees them now by driving eight miles from Wawona, the end of\r\nthe first day's staging. But the romance for the few there is in staging\r\nwill have to give way to the greater comfort of the many by rail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YOSEMITE DOME.]\r\n\r\nThe railway will do no more injury to the Yosemite than it has done to\r\nNiagara, and, in fact, will be the means of immensely increasing the\r\ncomfort of the visitor's stay there, besides enabling tens of thousands\r\nof people to see it who cannot stand the fatigue of the stage ride over\r\nthe present road. The Yosemite will remain as it is. The simplicity of\r\nits grand features is unassailable so long as the Government protects\r\nthe forests that surround it and the streams that pour into it. The\r\nvisitor who goes there by rail will find plenty of adventure for days\r\nand weeks in following the mountain trails, ascending to the great\r\npoints of view, exploring the cañons, or climbing so as to command the\r\nvast stretch of the snowy Sierras. Or, if he is not inclined to\r\nadventure, the valley itself will satisfy his highest imaginative\r\nflights of the sublime in rock masses and perpendicular ledges, and his\r\nsense of beauty in the graceful water-falls, rainbow colors, and\r\nexquisite lines of domes and pinnacles. It is in the grouping of objects\r\nof sublimity and beauty that the Yosemite excels. The narrow valley,\r\nwith its gigantic walls, which vary in every change of the point of\r\nview, lends itself to the most astonishing scenic effects, and these the\r\nphotograph has reproduced, so that the world is familiar with the\r\nstriking features of the valley, and has a tolerably correct idea of the\r\nsublimity of some of these features. What the photograph cannot do is to\r\ngive an impression of the unique grouping, of the majesty, and at times\r\ncrushing weight upon the mind of the forms and masses, of the\r\natmospheric splendor and illusion, and of the total value of such an\r\nassemblage of wonders. The level surface of the peaceful, park-like\r\nvalley has much to do with the impression. The effect of El Capitan,\r\nseen across a meadow and rising from a beautiful park, is much greater\r\nthan if it were encountered in a savage mountain gorge. The traveller\r\nmay have seen elsewhere greater water-falls, and domes and spires of\r\nrock as surprising, but he has nowhere else seen such a combination as\r\nthis. He may be fortified against surprise by the photographs he has\r\nseen and the reports of word painters, but he will not escape (say, at\r\nInspiration Point, or Artist Point, or other lookouts), a quickening of\r\nthe pulse and an elation which is physical as well as mental, in the\r\nsight of such unexpected sublimity and beauty. And familiarity will\r\nscarcely take off the edge of his delight, so varied are the effects in\r\nthe passing hours and changing lights. The Rainbow Fall, when water is\r\nabundant, is exceedingly impressive as well as beautiful. Seen from the\r\ncarriage road, pouring out of the sky overhead, it gives a sense of\r\npower, and at the proper hour before sunset, when the vast mass of\r\nleaping, foaming water is shot through with the colors of the spectrum,\r\nit is one of the most exquisite sights the world can offer; the\r\nelemental forces are overwhelming, but the loveliness is engaging. One\r\nturns from this to the noble mass of El Capitan with a shock of\r\nsurprise, however often it may have been seen. This is the hour also, in\r\nthe time of high-water, to see the reflection of the Yosemite Falls. As\r\na spectacle it is infinitely finer than anything at Mirror Lake, and is\r\nunique in its way. To behold this beautiful series of falls, flowing\r\ndown out of the blue sky above, and flowing up out of an equally blue\r\nsky in the depths of the earth, is a sight not to be forgotten. And\r\nwhen the observer passes from these displays to the sight of the aerial\r\ndomes in the upper end of the valley, new wonders opening at every turn\r\nof the forest road, his excitement has little chance of subsiding: he\r\nmay be even a little oppressed. The valley, so verdant and friendly with\r\ngrass and trees and flowers, is so narrow compared with the height of\r\nits perpendicular guardian walls, and this little secluded spot is so\r\nimprisoned in the gigantic mountains, that man has a feeling of\r\nhelplessness in it. This powerlessness in the presence of elemental\r\nforces was heightened by the deluge of water. There had been an immense\r\nfall of snow the winter before, the Merced was a raging torrent,\r\noverflowing its banks, and from every ledge poured a miniature cataract.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COAST OF MONTEREY.]\r\n\r\nNoble simplicity is the key-note to the scenery of the Yosemite, and\r\nthis is enhanced by the park-like appearance of the floor of the valley.\r\nThe stems of the fine trees are in harmony with the perpendicular lines,\r\nand their foliage adds the necessary contrast to the gray rock masses.\r\nIn order to preserve these forest-trees, the underbrush, which is\r\nliable to make a conflagration in a dry season, should be removed\r\ngenerally, and the view of the great features be left unimpeded. The\r\nminor cañons and the trails are, of course, left as much as possible to\r\nthe riot of vegetation. The State Commission, which labors under the\r\ndisadvantages of getting its supplies from a Legislature that does not\r\nappreciate the value of the Yosemite to California, has developed the\r\ntrails judiciously, and established a model trail service. The Yosemite,\r\nit need not be said, is a great attraction to tourists from all parts of\r\nthe world; it is the interest of the State, therefore, to increase their\r\nnumber by improving the facilities for reaching it, and by resolutely\r\npreserving all the surrounding region from ravage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYPRESS POINT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEAR SEAL ROCK.]\r\n\r\nThis is as true of the Mariposa big tree region as of the valley.\r\nIndeed, more care is needed for the trees than for the great chasm, for\r\nman cannot permanently injure the distinctive features of the latter,\r\nwhile the destruction of the sequoias will be an irreparable loss to the\r\nState and to the world. The _Sequoia gigantea_ differs in leaf, and size\r\nand shape of cone, from the great _Sequoia semper virens_ on the coast\r\nnear Santa Cruz; neither can be spared. The Mariposa trees, scattered\r\nalong on a mountain ridge 6500 feet above the sea, do not easily obtain\r\ntheir victory, for they are a part of a magnificent forest of other\r\ngrowths, among which the noble sugar-pine is conspicuous for its\r\nenormous size and graceful vigor. The sequoias dominate among splendid\r\nrivals only by a magnitude that has no comparison elsewhere in the\r\nworld. I think no one can anticipate the effect that one of these\r\nmonarchs will have upon him. He has read that a coach and six can drive\r\nthrough one of the trees that is standing; that another is thirty-three\r\nfeet in diameter, and that its vast stem, 350 feet high, is crowned with\r\na mass of foliage that seems to brush against the sky. He might be\r\nprepared for a tower 100 feet in circumference, and even 400 feet high,\r\nstanding upon a level plain; but this living growth is quite another\r\naffair. Each tree is an individual, and has a personal character. No man\r\ncan stand in the presence of one of these giants without a new sense of\r\nthe age of the world and the insignificant span of one human life; but\r\nhe is also overpowered by a sense of some gigantic personality. It does\r\nnot relieve him to think of this as the Methuselah of trees, or to call\r\nit by the name of some great poet or captain. The awe the tree inspires\r\nis of itself. As one lies and looks up at the enormous bulk, it seems\r\nnot so much the bulk, so lightly is it carried, as the spirit of the\r\ntree--the elastic vigor, the patience, the endurance of storm and\r\nchange, the confident might, and the soaring, almost contemptuous pride,\r\nthat overwhelm the puny spectator. It is just because man can measure\r\nhimself, his littleness, his brevity of existence, with this growth out\r\nof the earth, that he is more personally impressed by it than he might\r\nbe by the mere variation in the contour of the globe which is called a\r\nmountain. The imagination makes a plausible effort to comprehend it, and\r\nis foiled. No; clearly it is not mere size that impresses one; it is the\r\ndignity, the character in the tree, the authority and power of\r\nantiquity. Side by side of these venerable forms are young sequoias,\r\ngreat trees themselves, that have only just begun their millennial\r\ncareer--trees that will, if spared, perpetuate to remote ages this race\r\nof giants, and in two to four thousand years from now take the place of\r\ntheir great-grandfathers, who are sinking under the weight of years, and\r\none by one measuring their length on the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAGUNA, FROM THE SOUTH-EAST.]\r\n\r\nThe transition from the sublime to the exquisitely lovely in nature can\r\nnowhere else be made with more celerity than from the Sierras to the\r\ncoast at Monterey; California abounds in such contrasts and surprises.\r\nAfter the great stirring of the emotions by the Yosemite and the\r\nMariposa, the Hotel del Monte Park and vicinity offer repose, and make\r\nan appeal to the sense of beauty and refinement. Yet even here something\r\nunique is again encountered. I do not refer to the extraordinary beauty\r\nof the giant live-oaks and the landscape-gardening about the hotel,\r\nwhich have made Monterey famous the world over, but to the sea-beach\r\ndrive of sixteen miles, which can scarcely be rivalled elsewhere either\r\nfor marine loveliness or variety of coast scenery. It has points like\r\nthe ocean drive at Newport, but is altogether on a grander scale, and\r\nshows a more poetic union of shore and sea; besides, it offers the\r\ncurious and fascinating spectacles of the rocks inhabited by the\r\nsea-lions, and the Cypress Point. These huge, uncouth creatures can be\r\nseen elsewhere, but probably nowhere else on this coast are they massed\r\nin greater numbers. The trees of Cypress Point are unique, this species\r\nof cypress having been found nowhere else. The long, never-ceasing swell\r\nof the Pacific incessantly flows up the many crescent sand beaches,\r\ncasting up shells of brilliant hues, sea-weed, and kelp, which seems\r\ninstinct with animal life, and flotsam from the far-off islands. But the\r\nrocks that lie off the shore, and the jagged points that project in\r\nfanciful forms, break the even great swell, and send the waters, churned\r\ninto spray and foam, into the air with a thousand hues in the sun. The\r\nshock of these sharp collisions mingles with the heavy ocean boom.\r\nCypress Point is one of the most conspicuous of these projections, and\r\nits strange trees creep out upon the ragged ledges almost to the water's\r\nedge. These cypresses are quite as instinct with individual life and\r\nquite as fantastic as any that Doré drew for his \"Inferno.\" They are as\r\ngnarled and twisted as olive-trees two centuries old, but their\r\nattitudes seem not only to show struggle with the elements, but agony in\r\nthat struggle. The agony may be that of torture in the tempest, or of\r\nsome fabled creatures fleeing and pursued, stretching out their long\r\narms in terror, and fixed in that writhing fear. They are creatures of\r\nthe sea quite as much as of the land, and they give to this lovely coast\r\na strange charm and fascination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER, XVI.\r\n\r\nFASCINATIONS OF THE DESERT.--THE LAGUNA PUEBLO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traveller to California by the Santa Fé route comes into the arid\r\nregions gradually, and finds each day a variety of objects of interest\r\nthat upsets his conception of a monotonous desert land. If he chooses to\r\nbreak the continental journey midway, he can turn aside at Las Vegas to\r\nthe Hot Springs. Here, at the head of a picturesque valley, is the\r\nMontezuma Hotel, a luxurious and handsome house, 6767 feet above\r\nsea-level, a great surprise in the midst of the broken and somewhat\r\nsavage New Mexican scenery. The low hills covered with pines and piñons,\r\nthe romantic glens, and the wide views from the elevations about the\r\nhotel, make it an attractive place; and a great deal has been done, in\r\nthe erection of bath-houses, ornamental gardening, and the grading of\r\nroads and walks, to make it a comfortable place. The latitude and the\r\ndryness of the atmosphere insure for the traveller from the North in our\r\nwinter an agreeable reception, and the elevation makes the spot in the\r\nsummer a desirable resort from Southern heat. It is a sanitarium as well\r\nas a pleasure resort. The Hot Springs have much the same character as\r\nthe Töplitz waters in Bohemia, and the saturated earth--the\r\n_Mütterlager_--furnishes the curative \"mud baths\" which are enjoyed at\r\nMarienbad and Carlsbad. The union of the climate, which is so favorable\r\nin diseases of the respiratory organs, with the waters, which do so much\r\nfor rheumatic sufferers, gives a distinction to Las Vegas Hot Springs.\r\nThis New Mexican air--there is none purer on the globe--is an enemy to\r\nhay-fever and malarial diseases. It was a wise enterprise to provide\r\nthat those who wish to try its efficacy can do so at the Montezuma\r\nwithout giving up any of the comforts of civilized life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH AT LAGUNA.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to explain to one who has not seen it, or will not put\r\nhimself in the leisurely frame of mind to enjoy it, the charms of the\r\ndesert of the high plateaus of New Mexico and Arizona. Its arid\r\ncharacter is not so impressive as its ancientness; and the part which\r\ninterests us is not only the procession of the long geologic eras,\r\nvisible in the extinct volcanoes, the _barrancas_, the painted buttes,\r\nthe petrified forests, but as well in the evidences of civilizations\r\ngone by, or the remains of them surviving in our day--the cliff\r\ndwellings, the ruins of cities that were thriving when Coronado sent his\r\nlieutenants through the region three centuries ago, and the present\r\nresidences of the Pueblo Indians, either villages perched upon an almost\r\ninaccessible rock like Acamo, or clusters of adobe dwellings like Isleta\r\nand Laguna. The Pueblo Indians, of whom the Zuñis are a tribe, have been\r\ndwellers in villages and cultivators of the soil and of the arts of\r\npeace immemorially, a gentle, amiable race. It is indeed such a race as\r\none would expect to find in the land of the sun and the cactus. Their\r\nmanners and their arts attest their antiquity and a long refinement in\r\nfixed dwellings and occupations. The whole region is a most interesting\r\nfield for the antiquarian.\r\n\r\nWe stopped one day at Laguna, which is on the Santa Fé line west of\r\nIsleta, another Indian pueblo at the Atlantic and Pacific junction,\r\nwhere the road crosses the Rio Grande del Norte west of Albuquerque.\r\nNear Laguna a little stream called the Rio Puerco flows southward and\r\njoins the Rio Grande. There is verdure along these streams, and gardens\r\nand fruit orchards repay the rude irrigation. In spite of these\r\nwatercourses the aspect of the landscape is wild and desert-like--low\r\nbarren hills and ragged ledges, wide sweeps of sand and dry gray bushes,\r\nwith mountains and long lines of horizontal ledges in the distance.\r\nLaguna is built upon a rounded elevation of rock. Its appearance is\r\nexactly that of a Syrian village, the same cluster of little, square,\r\nflat-roofed houses in terraces, the same brown color, and under the same\r\npale blue sky. And the resemblance was completed by the figures of the\r\nwomen on the roofs, or moving down the slope, erect and supple, carrying\r\non the head a water jar, and holding together by one hand the mantle\r\nworn like a Spanish _rebozo_. The village is irregularly built, without\r\nmuch regard to streets or alleys, and it has no special side of entrance\r\nor approach. Every side presents a blank wall of adobe, and the entrance\r\nseems quite by chance. Yet the way we went over, the smooth slope was\r\nworn here and there in channels three or four inches deep, as if by the\r\npassing feet of many generations. The only semblance of architectural\r\nregularity is in the plaza, not perfectly square, upon which some of the\r\nhouses look, and where the annual dances take place. The houses have the\r\neffect of being built in terraces rising one above the other, but it is\r\nhard to say exactly what a house is--whether it is anything more than\r\none room. You can reach some of the houses only by aid of a ladder. You\r\nenter others from the street. If you will go farther you must climb a\r\nladder which brings you to the roof that is used as the sitting-room or\r\ndoor-yard of the next room. From this room you may still ascend to\r\nothers, or you may pass through low and small door-ways to other\r\napartments. It is all haphazard, but exceedingly picturesque. You may\r\nfind some of the family in every room, or they may be gathered, women\r\nand babies, on a roof which is protected by a parapet. At the time of\r\nour visit the men were all away at work in their fields. Notwithstanding\r\nthe houses are only sun-dried bricks, and the village is without water\r\nor street commissioners, I was struck by the universal cleanliness.\r\nThere was no refuse in the corners or alleys, no odors, and many of the\r\nrooms were patterns of neatness. To be sure, an old woman here and there\r\nkept her hens in an adjoining apartment above her own, and there was the\r\nlitter of children and of rather careless house-keeping. But, taken\r\naltogether, the town is an example for some more civilized, whose\r\ninhabitants wash oftener and dress better than these Indians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TERRACED HOUSES, PUEBLO OF LAGUNA.]\r\n\r\nWe were put on friendly terms with the whole settlement through three or\r\nfour young maidens who had been at the Carlisle school, and spoke\r\nEnglish very prettily. They were of the ages of fifteen and sixteen, and\r\nsome of them had been five years away. They came back, so far as I could\r\nlearn, gladly to their own people and to the old ways. They had resumed\r\nthe Indian dress, which is much more becoming to them, as I think they\r\nknow, than that which had been imposed upon them. I saw no books. They\r\ndo not read any now, and they appear to be perfectly content with the\r\nidle drudgery of their semi-savage condition. In time they will marry in\r\ntheir tribe, and the school episode will be a thing of the past. But not\r\naltogether. The pretty Josephine, who was our best cicerone about the\r\nplace, a girl of lovely eyes and modest mien, showed us with pride her\r\nown room, or \"house,\" as she called it, neat as could be, simply\r\nfurnished with an iron bedstead and snow-white cot, a mirror, chair, and\r\ntable, and a trunk, and some \"advertising\" prints on the walls. She said\r\nthat she was needed at home to cook for her aged mother, and her present\r\nambition was to make money enough by the sale of pottery and curios to\r\nbuy a cooking stove, so that she could cook more as the whites do. The\r\nhouse-work of the family had mainly fallen upon her; but it was not\r\nburdensome, I fancied, and she and the other girls of her age had\r\nleisure to go to the station on the arrival of every train, in hope of\r\nselling something to the passengers, and to sit on the rocks in the sun\r\nand dream as maidens do. I fancy it would be better for Josephine and\r\nfor all the rest if there were no station and no passing trains. The\r\nelder women were uniformly ugly, but not repulsive like the Mojaves; the\r\nplace swarmed with children, and the babies, aged women, and pleasing\r\nyoung girls grouped most effectively on the roofs.\r\n\r\nThe whole community were very complaisant and friendly when we came to\r\nknow them well, which we did in the course of an hour, and they enjoyed\r\nas much as we did the bargaining for pottery. They have for sale a great\r\nquantity of small pieces, fantastic in form and brilliantly\r\ncolored--toys, in fact; but we found in their houses many beautiful jars\r\nof large size and excellent shape, decorated most effectively. The\r\nordinary utensils for cooking and for cooling water are generally pretty\r\nin design and painted artistically. Like the ancient Peruvians, they\r\nmake many vessels in the forms of beasts and birds. Some of the designs\r\nof the decoration are highly conventionalized, and others are just in\r\nthe proper artistic line of the natural--a spray with a bird, or a\r\nsunflower on its stalk. The ware is all unglazed, exceedingly light and\r\nthin, and baked so hard that it has a metallic sound when struck. Some\r\nof the large jars are classic in shape, and recall in form and\r\ndecoration the ancient Cypriote ware, but the colors are commonly\r\nbrilliant and barbaric. The designs seem to be indigenous, and to betray\r\nlittle Spanish influence. The art displayed in this pottery is indeed\r\nwonderful, and, to my eye, much more effective and lastingly pleasing\r\nthan much of our cultivated decoration. A couple of handsome jars that I\r\nbought of an old woman, she assured me she made and decorated herself;\r\nbut I saw no ovens there, nor any signs of manufacture, and suppose\r\nthat most of the ware is made at Acoma.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem to be a very religious community, although the town has\r\na Catholic church, and I understand that Protestant services are\r\nsometimes held in the place. The church is not much frequented, and the\r\nonly evidence of devotion I encountered was in a woman who wore a large\r\nand handsome silver cross, made by the Navajos. When I asked its price,\r\nshe clasped it to her bosom, with an upward look full of faith and of\r\nrefusal to part with her religion at any price. The church, which is\r\nadobe, and at least two centuries old, is one of the most interesting I\r\nhave seen anywhere. It is a simple parallelogram, 104 feet long and 21\r\nfeet broad, the gable having an opening in which the bells hang. The\r\ninterior is exceedingly curious, and its decorations are worth\r\nreproduction. The floor is of earth, and many of the tribe who were\r\ndistinguished and died long ago are said to repose under its smooth\r\nsurface, with nothing to mark their place of sepulture. It has an open\r\ntimber roof, the beams supported upon carved corbels. The ceiling is\r\nmade of wooden sticks, about two inches in diameter and some four feet\r\nlong, painted in alternated colors--red, blue, orange, and black--and so\r\ntwisted or woven together as to produce the effect of plaited straw, a\r\nmost novel and agreeable decoration. Over the entrance is a small\r\ngallery, the under roof of which is composed of sticks laid in straw\r\npattern and colored. All around the wall runs a most striking dado, an\r\nodd, angular pattern, with conventionalized birds at intervals, painted\r\nin strong yet _fade_ colors--red, yellow, black, and white. The north\r\nwall is without windows; all the light, when the door is closed, comes\r\nfrom two irregular windows, without glass, high up in the south wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND CAÑON ON THE COLORADO--VIEW FROM POINT SUBLIME.]\r\n\r\nThe chancel walls are covered with frescos, and there are several quaint\r\npaintings, some of them not very bad in color and drawing. The altar,\r\nwhich is supported at the sides by twisted wooden pillars, carved with a\r\nknife, is hung with ancient sheepskins brightly painted. Back of the\r\naltar are some archaic wooden images, colored; and over the altar, on\r\nthe ceiling, are the stars of heaven, and the sun and the moon, each\r\nwith a face in it. The interior was scrupulously clean and sweet and\r\nrestful to one coming in from the glare of the sun on the desert. It was\r\nevidently little used, and the Indians who accompanied us seemed under\r\nno strong impression of its sanctity; but we liked to linger in it, it\r\nwas so _bizarre_, so picturesque, and exhibited in its rude decoration\r\nso much taste. Two or three small birds flitting about seemed to enjoy\r\nthe coolness and the subdued light, and were undisturbed by our\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThese are children of the desert, kin in their condition and the\r\ninfluences that formed them to the sedentary tribes of upper Egypt and\r\nArabia, who pitch their villages upon the rocky eminences, and depend\r\nfor subsistence upon irrigation and scant pasturage. Their habits are\r\nthose of the dwellers in an arid land which has little in common with\r\nthe wilderness--the inhospitable northern wilderness of rain and frost\r\nand snow. Rain, to be sure, insures some sort of vegetation in the most\r\nforbidding and intractable country, but that does not save the harsh\r\nlandscape from being unattractive. The high plateaus of New Mexico and\r\nArizona have everything that the rainy wilderness lacks--sunshine,\r\nheaven's own air, immense breadth of horizon, color and infinite beauty\r\nof outline, and a warm soil with unlimited possibilities when moistened.\r\nAll that these deserts need is water. A fatal want? No. That is simply\r\nsaying that science can do for this region what it cannot do for the\r\nhigh wilderness of frost--by the transportation of water transform it\r\ninto gardens of bloom and fields of fruitfulness. The wilderness shall\r\nbe made to feed the desert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH AT LAGUNA.]\r\n\r\nI confess that these deserts in the warm latitudes fascinate me. Perhaps\r\nit is because I perceive in them such a chance for the triumph of the\r\nskill of man, seeing how, here and there, his energy has pushed the\r\ndesert out of his path across the continent. But I fear that I am not so\r\npractical. To many the desert in its stony sterility, its desolateness,\r\nits unbroken solitude, its fantastic savageness, is either appalling or\r\nrepulsive. To them it is tiresome and monotonous. The vast plains of\r\nKansas and Nebraska are monotonous even in the agricultural green of\r\nsummer. Not so to me the desert. It is as changeable in its lights and\r\ncolors as the ocean. It is even in its general features of sameness\r\nnever long the same. If you traverse it on foot or on horseback, there\r\nis ever some minor novelty. And on the swift train, if you draw down the\r\ncurtain against the glare, or turn to your book, you are sure to miss\r\nsomething of interest--a deep cañon rift in the plain, a turn that gives\r\na wide view glowing in a hundred hues in the sun, a savage gorge with\r\nbeetling rocks, a solitary butte or red truncated pyramid thrust up into\r\nthe blue sky, a horizontal ledge cutting the horizon line as straight as\r\na ruler for miles, a pointed cliff uplifted sheer from the plain and\r\nlaid in regular courses of Cyclopean masonry, the battlements of a fort,\r\na terraced castle with towers and esplanade, a great trough of a valley,\r\ngray and parched, enclosed by far purple mountains. And then the\r\nunlimited freedom of it, its infinite expansion, its air like wine to\r\nthe senses, the floods of sunshine, the waves of color, the translucent\r\natmosphere that aids the imagination to create in the distance all\r\narchitectural splendors and realms of peace. It is all like a mirage and\r\na dream. We pass swiftly, and make a moving panorama of beauty in hues,\r\nof strangeness in forms, of sublimity in extent, of overawing and savage\r\nantiquity. I would miss none of it. And when we pass to the accustomed\r\nagain, to the fields of verdure and the forests and the hills of green,\r\nand are limited in view and shut in by that which we love, after all,\r\nbetter than the arid land, I have a great longing to see again the\r\ndesert, to be a part of its vastness, and to feel once more the freedom\r\nand inspiration of its illimitable horizons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE HEART OF THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an arid region lying in Northern Arizona and Southern Utah\r\nwhich has been called the District of the Grand Cañon of the Colorado.\r\nThe area, roughly estimated, contains from 13,000 to 16,000 square\r\nmiles--about the size of the State of Maryland. This region, fully\r\ndescribed by the explorers and studied by the geologists in the United\r\nStates service, but little known to even the travelling public, is\r\nprobably the most interesting territory of its size on the globe. At\r\nleast it is unique. In attempting to convey an idea of it the writer can\r\nbe assisted by no comparison, nor can he appeal in the minds of his\r\nreaders to any experience of scenery that can apply here. The so-called\r\nGrand Cañon differs not in degree from all other scenes; it differs in\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado River flows southward through Utah, and crosses the Arizona\r\nline below the junction with the San Juan. It continues southward,\r\nflowing deep in what is called the Marble Cañon, till it is joined by\r\nthe Little Colorado, coming up from the south-east; it then turns\r\nwestward in a devious line until it drops straight south, and forms the\r\nwestern boundary of Arizona. The centre of the district mentioned is the\r\nwestwardly flowing part of the Colorado. South of the river is the\r\nColorado Plateau, at a general elevation of about 7000 feet. North of\r\nit the land is higher, and ascends in a series of plateaus, and then\r\nterraces, a succession of cliffs like a great stair-way, rising to the\r\nhigh plateaus of Utah. The plateaus, adjoining the river on the north\r\nand well marked by north and south dividing lines, or faults, are,\r\nnaming them from east to west, the Paria, the Kaibab, the Kanab, the\r\nUinkaret, and the Sheavwitz, terminating in a great wall on the west,\r\nthe Great Wash fault, where the surface of the country drops at once\r\nfrom a general elevation of 6000 feet to from 1300 to 3000 feet above\r\nthe sea-level--into a desolate and formidable desert.\r\n\r\nIf the Grand Cañon itself did not dwarf everything else, the scenery of\r\nthese plateaus would be superlative in interest. It is not all desert,\r\nnor are the gorges, cañons, cliffs, and terraces, which gradually\r\nprepare the mind for the comprehension of the Grand Cañon, the only\r\nwonders of this land of enchantment. These are contrasted with the\r\nsylvan scenery of the Kaibab Plateau, its giant forests and parks, and\r\nbroad meadows decked in the summer with wild flowers in dense masses of\r\nscarlet, white, purple, and yellow. The Vermilion Cliffs, the Pink\r\nCliffs, the White Cliffs, surpass in fantastic form and brilliant color\r\nanything that the imagination conceives possible in nature, and there\r\nare dreamy landscapes quite beyond the most exquisite fancies of Claude\r\nand of Turner. The region is full of wonders, of beauties, and\r\nsublimities that Shelley's imaginings do not match in the \"Prometheus\r\nUnbound,\" and when it becomes accessible to the tourist it will offer an\r\nendless field for the delight of those whose minds can rise to the\r\nheights of the sublime and the beautiful. In all imaginative writing or\r\npainting the material used is that of human experience, otherwise it\r\ncould not be understood; even heaven must be described in the terms of\r\nan earthly paradise. Human experience has no prototype of this region,\r\nand the imagination has never conceived of its forms and colors. It is\r\nimpossible to convey an adequate idea of it by pen or pencil or brush.\r\nThe reader who is familiar with the glowing descriptions in the official\r\nreports of Major J. W. Powell, Captain C. E. Dutton, Lieutenant Ives,\r\nand others, will not save himself from a shock of surprise when the\r\nreality is before him. This paper deals only with a single view in this\r\nmarvellous region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND CAÑON OF THE COLORADO--VIEW OPPOSITE POINT\r\nSUBLIME.]\r\n\r\nThe point where we struck the Grand Cañon, approaching it from the\r\nsouth, is opposite the promontory in the Kaibab Plateau named Point\r\nSublime by Major Powell, just north of the 36th parallel, and 112° 15'\r\nwest longitude. This is only a few miles west of the junction with the\r\nLittle Colorado. About three or four miles west of this junction the\r\nriver enters the east slope of the east Kaibab monocline, and here the\r\nGrand Cañon begins. Rapidly the chasm deepens to about 6000 feet, or\r\nrather it penetrates a higher country, the slope of the river remaining\r\nabout the same. Through this lofty plateau--an elevation of 7000 to 9000\r\nfeet--the chasm extends for sixty miles, gradually changing its course\r\nto the north-west, and entering the Kanab Plateau. The Kaibab division\r\nof the Grand Cañon is by far the sublimest of all, being 1000 feet\r\ndeeper than any other. It is not grander only on account of its greater\r\ndepth, but it is broader and more diversified with magnificent\r\narchitectural features.\r\n\r\nThe Kanab division, only less magnificent than the Kaibab, receives the\r\nKanab Cañon from the north and the Cataract Cañon from the south, and\r\nends at the Toroweap Valley.\r\n\r\nThe section of the Grand Cañon seen by those who take the route from\r\nPeach Springs is between 113° and 114° west longitude, and, though\r\nwonderful, presents few of the great features of either the Kaibab or\r\nthe Kanab divisions. The Grand Cañon ends, west longitude 114°, at the\r\nGreat Wash, west of the Hurricane Ledge or Fault. Its whole length from\r\nLittle Colorado to the Great Wash, measured by the meanderings of the\r\nsurface of the river, is 220 miles; by a median line between the crests\r\nof the summits of the walls with two-mile cords, about 195 miles; the\r\ndistance in a straight line is 125 miles.\r\n\r\nIn our journey to the Grand Cañon we left the Santa Fé line at\r\nFlagstaff, a new town with a lively lumber industry, in the midst of a\r\nspruce-pine forest which occupies the broken country through which the\r\nroad passes for over fifty miles. The forest is open, the trees of\r\nmoderate size are too thickly set with low-growing limbs to make clean\r\nlumber, and the foliage furnishes the minimum of shade; but the change\r\nto these woods is a welcome one from the treeless reaches of the desert\r\non either side. The cañon is also reached from Williams, the next\r\nstation west, the distance being a little shorter, and the point on the\r\ncañon visited being usually a little farther west. But the Flagstaff\r\nroute is for many reasons usually preferred. Flagstaff lies just\r\nsouth-east of the San Francisco Mountain, and on the great Colorado\r\nPlateau, which has a pretty uniform elevation of about 7000 feet above\r\nthe sea. The whole region is full of interest. Some of the most\r\nremarkable cliff dwellings are within ten miles of Flagstaff, on the\r\nWalnut Creek Cañon. At Holbrook, 100 miles east, the traveller finds a\r\nroad some forty miles long, that leads to the great petrified forest, or\r\nChalcedony Park. Still farther east are the villages of the Pueblo\r\nIndians, near the line, while to the northward is the great reservation\r\nof the Navajos, a nomadic tribe celebrated for its fine blankets and\r\npretty work in silver--a tribe that preserves much of its manly\r\nindependence by shunning the charity of the United States. No Indians\r\nhave come into intimate or dependent relations with the whites without\r\nbeing deteriorated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOURISTS IN THE COLORADO CAÑON.]\r\n\r\nFlagstaff is the best present point of departure, because it has a small\r\nhotel, good supply stores, and a large livery-stable, made necessary by\r\nthe business of the place and the objects of interest in the\r\nneighborhood, and because one reaches from there by the easiest road the\r\nfinest scenery incomparably on the Colorado. The distance is seventy-six\r\nmiles through a practically uninhabited country, much of it a desert,\r\nand with water very infrequent. No work has been done on the road; it is\r\nmade simply by driving over it. There are a few miles here and there of\r\nfair wheeling, but a good deal of it is intolerably dusty or exceedingly\r\nstony, and progress is slow. In the daytime (it was the last of June)\r\nthe heat is apt to be excessive; but this could be borne, the air is so\r\nabsolutely dry and delicious, and breezes occasionally spring up, if it\r\nwere not for the dust. It is, notwithstanding the novelty of the\r\nadventure and of the scenery by the way, a tiresome journey of two days.\r\nA day of rest is absolutely required at the cañon, so that five days\r\nmust be allowed for the trip. This will cost the traveller, according to\r\nthe size of the party made up, from forty to fifty dollars. But a much\r\nlonger sojourn at the cañon is desirable.\r\n\r\nOur party of seven was stowed in and on an old Concord coach drawn by\r\nsix horses, and piled with camp equipage, bedding, and provisions. A\r\nfour-horse team followed, loaded with other supplies and cooking\r\nutensils. The road lies on the east side of the San Francisco Mountain.\r\nReturning, we passed around its west side, gaining thus a complete view\r\nof this shapely peak. The compact range is a group of extinct volcanoes,\r\nthe craters of which are distinctly visible. The cup-like summit of the\r\nhighest is 13,000 feet above the sea, and snow always lies on the north\r\nescarpment. Rising about 6000 feet above the point of view of the great\r\nplateau, it is from all sides a noble object, the dark rock,\r\nsnow-sprinkled, rising out of the dense growth of pine and cedar. We\r\ndrove at first through open pine forests, through park-like intervals,\r\nover the foot-hills of the mountain, through growths of scrub cedar, and\r\nout into the ever-varying rolling country to widely-extended prospects.\r\nTwo considerable hills on our right attracted us by their unique beauty.\r\nUpon the summit and side of each was a red glow exactly like the tint of\r\nsunset. We thought surely that it was the effect of reflected light, but\r\nthe sky was cloudless and the color remained constant. The color came\r\nfrom the soil. The first was called Sunset Mountain. One of our party\r\nnamed the other, and the more beautiful, Peachblow Mountain, a poetic\r\nand perfectly descriptive name.\r\n\r\nWe lunched at noon beside a swift, clouded, cold stream of snow-water\r\nfrom the San Francisco, along which grew a few gnarled cedars and some\r\nbrilliant wild flowers. The scene was more than picturesque; in the\r\nclear hot air of the desert the distant landscape made a hundred\r\npictures of beauty. Behind us the dark form of San Francisco rose up\r\n6000 feet to its black crater and fields of spotless snow. Away off to\r\nthe north-east, beyond the brown and gray pastures, across a far line\r\ndistinct in dull color, lay the Painted Desert, like a mirage, like a\r\nreally painted landscape, glowing in red and orange and pink, an immense\r\ncity rather than a landscape, with towers and terraces and façades,\r\nmelting into indistinctness as in a rosy mist, spectral but constant,\r\nweltering in a tropic glow and heat, walls and columns and shafts, the\r\nwreck of an Oriental capital on a wide violet plain, suffused with\r\nbrilliant color softened into exquisite shades. All over this region\r\nnature has such surprises, that laugh at our inadequate conception of\r\nher resources.\r\n\r\nOur camp for the night was at the next place where water could be\r\nobtained, a station of the Arizona Cattle Company. Abundant water is\r\npiped down to it from mountain springs. The log-house and stable of the\r\ncow-boys were unoccupied, and we pitched our tent on a knoll by the\r\ncorral. The night was absolutely dry, and sparkling with the starlight.\r\nA part of the company spread their blankets on the ground under the sky.\r\nIt is apt to be cold in this region towards morning, but lodging in the\r\nopen air is no hardship in this delicious climate. The next day the way\r\npart of the distance, with only a road marked by wagon wheels, was\r\nthrough extensive and barren-looking cattle ranges, through pretty vales\r\nof grass surrounded by stunted cedars, and over stormy ridges and plains\r\nof sand and small bowlders. The water having failed at Red Horse, the\r\nonly place where it is usually found in the day's march, our horses went\r\nwithout, and we had resource to our canteens. The whole country is\r\nessentially arid, but snow falls in the winter-time, and its melting,\r\nwith occasional showers in the summer, create what are called surface\r\nwells, made by drainage. Many of them go dry by June. There had been no\r\nrain in the region since the last of March, but clouds were gathering\r\ndaily, and showers are always expected in July. The phenomenon of rain\r\non this baked surface, in this hot air, and with this immense horizon,\r\nis very interesting. Showers in this tentative time are local. In our\r\njourney we saw showers far off, we experienced a dash for ten minutes,\r\nbut it was local, covering not more than a mile or two square. We have\r\nin sight a vast canopy of blue sky, of forming and dispersing clouds. It\r\nis difficult for them to drop their moisture in the rising columns of\r\nhot air. The result at times was a very curious spectacle--rain in the\r\nsky that did not reach the earth. Perhaps some cold current high above\r\nus would condense the moisture, which would begin to fall in long\r\ntrailing sweeps, blown like fine folds of muslin, or like sheets of\r\ndissolving sugar, and then the hot air of the earth would dissipate it,\r\nand the showers would be absorbed in the upper regions. The heat was\r\nsometimes intense, but at intervals a refreshing wind would blow, the\r\nair being as fickle as the rain; and now and then we would see a slender\r\ncolumn of dust, a thousand or two feet high, marching across the desert,\r\napparently not more than two feet in diameter, and wavering like the\r\nthreads of moisture that tried in vain to reach the earth as rain. Of\r\nlife there was not much to be seen in our desert route. In the first day\r\nwe encountered no habitation except the ranch-house mentioned, and saw\r\nno human being; and the second day none except the solitary occupant of\r\nthe dried well at Red Horse, and two or three Indians on the hunt. A few\r\nsquirrels were seen, and a rabbit now and then, and occasionally a bird.\r\nThe general impression was that of a deserted land. But antelope abound\r\nin the timber regions, and we saw several of these graceful creatures\r\nquite near us. Excellent antelope steaks, bought of the wandering Indian\r\nhunters, added something to our \"canned\" supplies. One day as we\r\nlunched, without water, on the cedar slope of a lovely grass interval,\r\nwe saw coming towards us over the swells of the prairie a figure of a\r\nman on a horse. It rode to us straight as the crow flies. The Indian\r\npony stopped not two feet from where our group sat, and the rider, who\r\nwas an Oualapai chief, clad in sacking, with the print of the brand of\r\nflour or salt on his back, dismounted with his Winchester rifle, and\r\nstood silently looking at us without a word of salutation. He stood\r\nthere, impassive, until we offered him something to eat. Having eaten\r\nall we gave him, he opened his mouth and said, \"Smoke 'em?\" Having\r\nprocured from the other wagon a pipe of tobacco and a pull at the\r\ndriver's canteen, he returned to us all smiles. His only baggage was the\r\nskull of an antelope, with the horns, hung at his saddle. Into this he\r\nput the bread and meat which we gave him, mounted the wretched pony, and\r\nwithout a word rode straight away. At a little distance he halted,\r\ndismounted, and motioned towards the edge of the timber, where he had\r\nspied an antelope. But the game eluded him, and he mounted again and\r\nrode off across the desert--a strange figure. His tribe lives in the\r\ncañon some fifty miles west, and was at present encamped, for the\r\npurpose of hunting, in the pine woods not far from the point we were\r\naiming at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nON THE BRINK OF THE GRAND CAÑON.--THE UNIQUE MARVEL OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way seemed long. With the heat and dust and slow progress, it was\r\nexceedingly wearisome. Our modern nerves are not attuned to the slow\r\ncrawling of a prairie-wagon. There had been growing for some time in the\r\ncoach a feeling that the journey did not pay; that, in fact, no mere\r\nscenery could compensate for the fatigue of the trip. The imagination\r\ndid not rise to it. \"It will have to be a very big cañon,\" said the\r\nduchess.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we entered an open pine forest, passed through a\r\nmeadow where the Indians had set their camp by a shallow pond, and drove\r\nalong a ridge, in the cool shades, for three or four miles. Suddenly, on\r\nthe edge of a descent, we who were on the box saw through the tree-tops\r\na vision that stopped the pulse for a second, and filled us with\r\nexcitement. It was only a glimpse, far off and apparently lifted up--red\r\ntowers, purple cliffs, wide-spread apart, hints of color and splendor;\r\non the right distance, mansions, gold and white and carmine (so the\r\nlight made them), architectural habitations in the sky it must be, and\r\nsuggestions of others far off in the middle distance--a substantial\r\naerial city, or the ruins of one, such as the prophet saw in a vision.\r\nIt was only a glimpse. Our hearts were in our mouths. We had a vague\r\nimpression of something wonderful, fearful--some incomparable splendor\r\nthat was not earthly. Were we drawing near the \"City?\" and should we\r\nhave yet a more perfect view thereof? Was it Jerusalem or some Hindoo\r\ntemples there in the sky? \"It was builded of pearls and precious stones,\r\nalso the streets were paved with gold; so that by reason of the natural\r\nglory of the city, and the reflection of the sunbeams upon it, Christian\r\nwith desire fell sick.\" It was a momentary vision of a vast amphitheatre\r\nof splendor, mostly hidden by the trees and the edge of the plateau.\r\n\r\nWe descended into a hollow. There was the well, a log-cabin, a tent or\r\ntwo under the pine-trees. We dismounted with impatient haste. The sun\r\nwas low in the horizon, and had long withdrawn from this grassy dell.\r\nTired as we were, we could not wait. It was only to ascend the little\r\nsteep, stony slope--300 yards--and we should see! Our party were\r\nstraggling up the hill: two or three had reached the edge. I looked up.\r\nThe duchess threw up her arms and screamed. We were not fifteen paces\r\nbehind, but we saw nothing. We took the few steps, and the whole\r\nmagnificence broke upon us. No one could be prepared for it. The scene\r\nis one to strike dumb with awe, or to unstring the nerves; one might\r\nstand in silent astonishment, another would burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThere are some experiences that cannot be repeated--one's first view of\r\nRome, one's first view of Jerusalem. But these emotions are produced by\r\nassociation, by the sudden standing face to face with the scenes most\r\nwrought into our whole life and education by tradition and religion.\r\nThis was without association, as it was without parallel. It was a shock\r\nso novel that the mind, dazed, quite failed to comprehend it. All that\r\nwe could grasp was a vast confusion of amphitheatres and strange\r\narchitectural forms resplendent with color. The vastness of the view\r\namazed us quite as much as its transcendent beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND CAÑON OF THE COLORADO--VIEW FROM THE HANSE TRAIL.]\r\n\r\nWe had expected a cañon--two lines of perpendicular walls 6000 feet\r\nhigh, with the ribbon of a river at the bottom; but the reader may\r\ndismiss all his notions of a cañon, indeed of any sort of mountain or\r\ngorge scenery with which he is familiar. We had come into a new world.\r\nWhat we saw was not a cañon, or a chasm, or a gorge, but a vast area\r\nwhich is a break in the plateau. From where we stood it was twelve miles\r\nacross to the opposite walls--a level line of mesa on the Utah side. We\r\nlooked up and down for twenty to thirty miles. This great space is\r\nfilled with gigantic architectural constructions, with amphitheatres,\r\ngorges, precipices, walls of masonry, fortresses terraced up to the\r\nlevel of the eye, temples mountain size, all brilliant with horizontal\r\nlines of color--streaks of solid hues a few feet in width, streaks a\r\nthousand feet in width--yellows, mingled white and gray, orange, dull\r\nred, brown, blue, carmine, green, all blending in the sunlight into one\r\ntranscendent suffusion of splendor. Afar off we saw the river in two\r\nplaces, a mere thread, as motionless and smooth as a strip of mirror,\r\nonly we knew it was a turbid, boiling torrent, 6000 feet below us.\r\nDirectly opposite the overhanging ledge on which we stood was a\r\nmountain, the sloping base of which was ashy gray and bluish; it rose in\r\na series of terraces to a thousand-feet wall of dark red sandstone,\r\nreceding upward, with ranges of columns and many fantastic sculptures,\r\nto a finial row of gigantic opera-glasses 6000 feet above the river. The\r\ngreat San Francisco Mountain, with its snowy crater, which we had passed\r\non the way, might have been set down in the place of this one, and it\r\nwould have been only one in a multitude of such forms that met the eye\r\nwhichever way we looked. Indeed, all the vast mountains in this region\r\nmight be hidden in this cañon.\r\n\r\nWandering a little away from the group and out of sight, and turning\r\nsuddenly to the scene from another point of view, I experienced for a\r\nmoment an indescribable terror of nature, a confusion of mind, a fear to\r\nbe alone in such a presence. With all this grotesqueness and majesty of\r\nform and radiance of color, creation seemed in a whirl. With our\r\neducation in scenery of a totally different kind, I suppose it would\r\nneed long acquaintance with this to familiarize one with it to the\r\nextent of perfect mental comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe vast abyss has an atmosphere of its own, one always changing and\r\nproducing new effects, an atmosphere and shadows and tones of its\r\nown--golden, rosy, gray, brilliant, and sombre, and playing a thousand\r\nfantastic tricks to the vision. The rich and wonderful color effects,\r\nsays Captain Dutton, \"are due to the inherent colors of the rocks,\r\nmodified by the atmosphere. Like any other great series of strata in the\r\nplateau province, the carboniferous has its own range of colors, which\r\nmight serve to distinguish it, even if we had no other criterion. The\r\nsummit strata are pale gray, with a faint yellowish cast. Beneath them\r\nthe cross-bedded sandstone appears, showing a mottled surface of pale\r\npinkish hue. Underneath this member are nearly 1000 feet of the lower\r\nAubrey sandstones, displaying an intensely brilliant red, which is\r\nsomewhat marked by the talus shot down from the gray cherty limestone at\r\nthe summit. Beneath the lower Aubrey is the face of the Red Wall\r\nlimestone, from 2000 to 3000 feet high. It has a strong red tone, but a\r\nvery peculiar one. Most of the red strata of the West have the brownish\r\nor vermilion tones, but these are rather purplish red, as if the pigment\r\nhad been treated to a dash of blue. It is not quite certain that this\r\nmay not arise in part from the intervention of the blue haze, and\r\nprobably it is rendered more conspicuous by this cause; but, on the\r\nwhole, the purplish cast seems to be inherent. This is the dominant\r\ncolor of the cañon, for the expanse of the rock surface displayed is\r\nmore than half in the Red Wall group.\"\r\n\r\nI was continually likening this to a vast city rather than a landscape,\r\nbut it was a city of no man's creation nor of any man's conception. In\r\nthe visions which inspired or crazy painters have had of the New\r\nJerusalem, of Babylon the Great, of a heaven in the atmosphere, with\r\nendless perspective of towers and steeps that hang in the twilight sky,\r\nthe imagination has tried to reach this reality. But here are effects\r\nbeyond the artist, forms the architect has not hinted at; and yet\r\neverything reminds us of man's work. And the explorers have tried by the\r\nuse of Oriental nomenclature to bring it within our comprehension, the\r\nEast being the land of the imagination. There is the Hindoo\r\nAmphitheatre, the Bright Angel Amphitheatre, the Ottoman Amphitheatre,\r\nShiva's Temple, Vishnu's Temple, Vulcan's Throne. And here, indeed, is\r\nthe idea of the pagoda architecture, of the terrace architecture, of the\r\nbizarre constructions which rise with projecting buttresses, rows of\r\npillars, recesses, battlements, esplanades, and low walls, hanging\r\ngardens, and truncated pinnacles. It is a city, but a city of the\r\nimagination. In many pages I could tell what I saw in one day's lounging\r\nfor a mile or so along the edge of the precipice. The view changed at\r\nevery step, and was never half an hour the same in one place. Nor did it\r\nneed much fancy to create illusions or pictures of unearthly beauty.\r\nThere was a castle, terraced up with columns, plain enough, and below it\r\na parade-ground; at any moment the knights in armor and with banners\r\nmight emerge from the red gates and deploy there, while the ladies\r\nlooked down from the balconies. But there were many castles and\r\nfortresses and barracks and noble mansions. And the rich sculpture in\r\nthis brilliant color! In time I began to see queer details: a Richardson\r\nhouse, with low portals and round arches, surmounted by a Nuremberg\r\ngable; perfect panels, 600 feet high, for the setting of pictures; a\r\ntrain of cars partly derailed at the door of a long, low warehouse, with\r\na garden in front of it. There was no end to such devices.\r\n\r\nIt was long before I could comprehend the vastness of the view, see the\r\nenormous chasms and rents and seams, and the many architectural ranges\r\nseparated by great gulfs, between me and the wall of the mesa twelve\r\nmiles distant. Away to the north-east was the blue Navajo Mountain, the\r\nlone peak in the horizon; but on the southern side of it lay a desert\r\nlevel, which in the afternoon light took on the exact appearance of a\r\nblue lake; its edge this side was a wall thousands of feet high, many\r\nmiles in length, and straightly horizontal; over this seemed to fall\r\nwater. I could see the foam of it at the foot of the cliff; and below\r\nthat was a lake of shimmering silver, in which the giant precipice and\r\nthe fall and their color were mirrored. Of course there was no silver\r\nlake, and the reflection that simulated it was only the sun on the lower\r\npart of the immense wall.\r\n\r\nSome one said that all that was needed to perfect this scene was a\r\nNiagara Falls. I thought what figure a fall 150 feet high and 3000 long\r\nwould make in this arena. It would need a spy-glass to discover it. An\r\nadequate Niagara here should be at least three miles in breadth, and\r\nfall 2000 feet over one of these walls. And the Yosemite--ah! the lovely\r\nYosemite! Dumped down into this wilderness of gorges and mountains, it\r\nwould take a guide who knew of its existence a long time to find it.\r\n\r\nThe process of creation is here laid bare through the geologic periods.\r\nThe strata of rock, deposited or upheaved, preserve their horizontal and\r\nparallel courses. If we imagine a river flowing on a plain, it would\r\nwear for itself a deeper and deeper channel. The walls of this channel\r\nwould recede irregularly by weathering and by the coming in of other\r\nstreams. The channel would go on deepening, and the outer walls would\r\nagain recede. If the rocks were of different material and degrees of\r\nhardness, the forms would be carved in the fantastic and architectural\r\nmanner we find them here. The Colorado flows through the tortuous inner\r\nchasm, and where we see it, it is 6000 feet below the surface where we\r\nstand, and below the towers of the terraced forms nearer it. The\r\nsplendid views of the cañon at this point given in Captain Dutton's\r\nreport are from Point Sublime, on the north side. There seems to have\r\nbeen no way of reaching the river from that point. From the south side\r\nthe descent, though wearisome, is feasible. It reverses mountaineering\r\nto descend 6000 feet for a view, and there is a certain pleasure in\r\nstanding on a mountain summit without the trouble of climbing it. Hance,\r\nthe guide, who has charge of the well, has made a path to the bottom.\r\nThe route is seven miles long. Half-way down he has a house by a spring.\r\nAt the bottom, somewhere in those depths, is a sort of farm, grass\r\ncapable of sustaining horses and cattle, and ground where fruit-trees\r\ncan grow. Horses are actually living there, and parties descend there\r\nwith tents, and camp for days at a time. It is a world of its own. Some\r\nof the photographic views presented here, all inadequate, are taken from\r\npoints on Hance's trail. But no camera or pen can convey an adequate\r\nconception of what Captain Dutton happily calls a great innovation in\r\nthe modern ideas of scenery. To the eye educated to any other, it may be\r\nshocking, grotesque, incomprehensible; but \"those who have long and\r\ncarefully studied the Grand Cañon of the Colorado do not hesitate for a\r\nmoment to pronounce it by far the most sublime of all earthly\r\nspectacles.\"\r\n\r\nI have space only to refer to the geologic history in Captain Dutton's\r\nreport of 1882, of which there should be a popular edition. The waters\r\nof the Atlantic once overflowed this region, and were separated from the\r\nPacific, if at all, only by a ridge. The story is of long eras of\r\ndeposits, of removal, of upheaval, and of volcanic action. It is\r\nestimated that in one period the thickness of strata removed and\r\ntransported away was 10,000 feet. Long after the Colorado began its work\r\nof corrosion there was a mighty upheaval. The reader will find the story\r\nof the making of the Grand Cañon more fascinating than any romance.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing this story the impression that one has in looking on\r\nthis scene is that of immense antiquity, hardly anywhere else on earth\r\nso overwhelming as here. It has been here in all its lonely grandeur and\r\ntranscendent beauty, exactly as it is, for what to us is an eternity,\r\nunknown, unseen by human eye. To the recent Indian, who roved along its\r\nbrink or descended to its recesses, it was not strange, because he had\r\nknown no other than the plateau scenery. It is only within a quarter of\r\na century that the Grand Cañon has been known to the civilized world. It\r\nis scarcely known now. It is a world largely unexplored. Those who best\r\nknow it are most sensitive to its awe and splendor. It is never twice\r\nthe same, for, as I said, it has an atmosphere of its own. I was told by\r\nHance that he once saw a thunder-storm in it. He described the chaos of\r\nclouds in the pit, the roar of the tempest, the reverberations of\r\nthunder, the inconceivable splendor of the rainbows mingled with the\r\ncolors of the towers and terraces. It was as if the world were breaking\r\nup. He fled away to his hut in terror.\r\n\r\nThe day is near when this scenery must be made accessible. A railway can\r\neasily be built from Flagstaff. The projected road from Utah, crossing\r\nthe Colorado at Lee's Ferry, would come within twenty miles of the\r\nGrand Cañon, and a branch to it could be built. The region is arid, and\r\nin the \"sight-seeing\" part of the year the few surface wells and springs\r\nare likely to go dry. The greatest difficulty would be in procuring\r\nwater for railway service or for such houses of entertainment as are\r\nnecessary. It could, no doubt, be piped from the San Francisco Mountain.\r\nAt any rate, ingenuity will overcome the difficulties, and travellers\r\nfrom the wide world will flock thither, for there is revealed the\r\nlong-kept secret, the unique achievement of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nA CLIMATE FOR INVALIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following notes on the climate of Southern California, written by\r\nDr. H. A. Johnson, of Chicago, at the solicitation of the writer of this\r\nvolume and for his information, I print with his permission, because the\r\ntestimony of a physician who has made a special study of climatology in\r\nEurope and America, and is a recognized authority, belongs of right to\r\nthe public:\r\n\r\n     The choice of a climate for invalids or semi-invalids involves\r\n     the consideration of: First, the invalid, his physical\r\n     condition (that is, disease), his peculiarities (mental and\r\n     emotional), his social habits, and his natural and artificial\r\n     needs. Second, the elements of climate, such as temperature,\r\n     moisture, direction and force of winds, the averages of the\r\n     elements, the extremes of variation, and the rapidity of\r\n     change.\r\n\r\n     The climates of the western and south-western portions of the\r\n     United States are well suited to a variety of morbid\r\n     conditions, especially those pertaining to the pulmonary organs\r\n     and the nervous system. Very few localities, however, are\r\n     equally well adapted to diseases of innervation of circulation\r\n     and respiration. For the first and second, as a rule, high\r\n     altitudes are not advisable; for the third, altitudes of from\r\n     two thousand to six thousand feet are not only admissible but\r\n     by many thought to be desirable. It seems, however, probable\r\n     that it is to the dryness of the air and the general\r\n     antagonisms to vegetable growths, rather than to altitude\r\n     alone, that the benefits derived in these regions by persons\r\n     suffering from consumption and kindred diseases should be\r\n     credited.\r\n\r\n     Proximity to large bodies of water, river valleys, and damp\r\n     plateaus are undesirable as places of residence for invalids\r\n     with lung troubles. There are exceptions to this rule.\r\n     Localities near the sea with a climate subject to slight\r\n     variations in temperature, a dry atmosphere, little rainfall,\r\n     much sunshine, not so cold in winter as to prevent much\r\n     out-door life and not so hot in summer as to make out-door\r\n     exercise exhausting, are well adapted not only to troubles of\r\n     the nervous and circulatory systems, but also to those of the\r\n     respiratory organs.\r\n\r\n     Such a climate is found in the extreme southern portions of\r\n     California. At San Diego the rainfall is much less, the air is\r\n     drier, and the number of sunshiny days very much larger than on\r\n     our Atlantic seaboard, or in Central and Northern California.\r\n     The winters are not cold; flowers bloom in the open air all the\r\n     year round; the summers are not hot. The mountains and sea\r\n     combine to give to this region a climate with few sudden\r\n     changes, and with a comfortable range of all essential\r\n     elements.\r\n\r\n     A residence during a part of the winter of 1889-90 at Coronado\r\n     Beach, and a somewhat careful study of the comparative\r\n     climatology of the south-western portions of the United States,\r\n     leads me to think that we have few localities where the\r\n     comforts of life can be secured, and which at the same time are\r\n     so well adapted to the needs of a variety of invalids, as San\r\n     Diego and its surroundings. In saying this I do not wish to be\r\n     understood as preferring it to all others for some one\r\n     condition or disease, but only that for weak hearts, disabled\r\n     lungs, and worn-out nerves it seems to me to be unsurpassed.\r\n\r\n                                    CHICAGO, _July 12, 1890_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF WINTER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Theodore S. Van Dyke's altogether admirable book on _Southern\r\nCalifornia_ I have permission to quote the following exquisite\r\ndescription of the floral procession from December to March, when the\r\nLand of the Sun is awakened by the first winter rain:\r\n\r\n     Sometimes this season commences with a fair rain in November,\r\n     after a light shower or two in October, but some of the very\r\n     best seasons begin about the time that all begin to lose hope.\r\n     November adds its full tribute to the stream of sunshine that\r\n     for months has poured along the land; and, perhaps, December\r\n     closes the long file of cloudless days with banners of blue and\r\n     gold. The plains and slopes lie bare and brown; the low hills\r\n     that break away from them are yellow with dead foxtail or wild\r\n     oats, gray with mustard-stalks, or ashy green with chemisal or\r\n     sage. Even the chaparral, that robes the higher hills in living\r\n     green, has a tired air, and the long timber-line that marks\r\n     the cañon winding up the mountain-slopes is decidedly paler.\r\n     The sea-breeze has fallen off to a faint breath of air; the\r\n     land lies silent and dreamy with golden haze; the air grows\r\n     drier, the sun hotter, and the shade cooler; the smoke of\r\n     brush-fires hangs at times along the sky; the water has risen\r\n     in the springs and sloughs as if to meet the coming rain, but\r\n     it has never looked less like rain than it now does.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly a new wind arises from the vast watery plains upon the\r\n     south-west; long, fleecy streams of cloud reach out along the\r\n     sky; the distant mountain-tops seem swimming in a film of haze,\r\n     and the great California weather prophet--a creature upon whom\r\n     the storms of adverse experience have beaten for years without\r\n     making even a weather crack in the smooth cheek of his\r\n     conceit--lavishes his wisdom as confidently as if he had never\r\n     made a false prediction. After a large amount of fuss, and\r\n     enough preliminary skirmishing over the sky for a dozen storms\r\n     in any Eastern State, the clouds at last get ready, and a soft\r\n     pattering is heard upon the roof--the sweetest music that ever\r\n     cheers a Californian ear, and one which the author of \"The Rain\r\n     upon the Roof\" should have heard before writing his poem.\r\n\r\n     When the sun again appears it is with a softer, milder beam\r\n     than before. The land looks bright and refreshed, like a tired\r\n     and dirty boy who has had a good bath and a nap, and already\r\n     the lately bare plains and hill-sides show a greenish tinge.\r\n     Fine little leaves of various kinds are springing from the\r\n     ground, but nearly all are lost in a general profusion of dark\r\n     green ones, of such shape and delicacy of texture that a\r\n     careless eye might readily take them for ferns. This is the\r\n     alfileria, the prevailing flower of the land. The rain may\r\n     continue at intervals. Daily the land grows greener, while the\r\n     shades of green, varied by the play of sunlight on the slopes\r\n     and rolling hills, increase in number and intensity. Here the\r\n     color is soft, and there bright; yonder it rolls in wavy\r\n     alternations, and yonder it reaches in an unbroken shade where\r\n     the plain sweeps broad and free. For many weeks green is the\r\n     only color, though cold nights may perhaps tinge it with a\r\n     rusty red. About the first of February a little starlike flower\r\n     of bluish pink begins to shine along the ground. This is the\r\n     bloom of the alfileria, and swiftly it spreads from the\r\n     southern slopes, where it begins, and runs from meadow to\r\n     hill-top. Soon after a cream-colored bell-flower begins to nod\r\n     from a tall, slender stalk; another of sky-blue soon opens\r\n     beside it; beneath these a little five-petaled flower of deep\r\n     pink tries to outshine the blossoms of the alfileria; and above\r\n     them soon stands the radiant shooting-star, with reflexed\r\n     petals of white, yellow, and pink shining behind its purplish\r\n     ovaries. On every side violets, here of the purest golden hue\r\n     and overpowering fragrance, appear in numbers beyond all\r\n     conception. And soon six or seven varieties of clover, all with\r\n     fine, delicate leaves, unfold flowers of yellow, red, and pink.\r\n     Delicate little crucifers of white and yellow shine modestly\r\n     below all these; little cream-colored flowers on slender scapes\r\n     look skyward on every side; while others of purer white, with\r\n     every variety of petal, crowd up among them. Standing now upon\r\n     some hill-side that commands miles of landscape, one is dazzled\r\n     with a blaze of color, from acres and acres of pink, great\r\n     fields of violets, vast reaches of blue, endless sweeps of\r\n     white.\r\n\r\n     Upon this--merely the warp of the carpet about to cover the\r\n     land--the sun fast weaves a woof of splendor. Along the\r\n     southern slopes of the lower hills soon beams the orange light\r\n     of the poppy, which swiftly kindles the adjacent slopes, then\r\n     flames along the meadow, and blazes upon the northern\r\n     hill-sides. Spires of green, mounting on every side, soon open\r\n     upon the top into lilies of deep lavender, and the scarlet\r\n     bracts of the painted-cup glow side by side with the crimson of\r\n     the cardinal-flower. And soon comes the iris, with its broad\r\n     golden eye fringed with rays of lavender blue; and five\r\n     varieties of phacelia overwhelm some places with waves of\r\n     purple, blue, indigo, and whitish pink. The evening primrose\r\n     covers the lower slopes with long sheets of brightest yellow,\r\n     and from the hills above the rock-rose adds its golden bloom to\r\n     that of the sorrel and the wild alfalfa, until the hills almost\r\n     outshine the bright light from the slopes and plains. And\r\n     through all this nods a tulip of most delicate lavender;\r\n     vetches, lupins, and all the members of the wild-pea family are\r\n     pushing and winding their way everywhere in every shade of\r\n     crimson, purple, and white; along the ground crowfoot weaves a\r\n     mantle of white, through which, amid a thousand comrades, the\r\n     orthocarpus rears its tufted head of pink. Among all these are\r\n     mixed a thousand other flowers, plenty enough as plenty would\r\n     be accounted in other countries, but here mere pin-points on a\r\n     great map of colors.\r\n\r\n     As the stranger gazes upon this carpet that now covers hill and\r\n     dale, undulates over the table-lands, and robes even the\r\n     mountain with a brilliancy and breadth of color that strikes\r\n     the eye from miles away, he exhausts his vocabulary of\r\n     superlatives, and goes away imagining he has seen it all. Yet\r\n     he has seen only the background of an embroidery more varied,\r\n     more curious and splendid, than the carpet upon which it is\r\n     wrought. Asters bright with centre of gold and lavender rays\r\n     soon shine high above the iris, and a new and larger tulip of\r\n     deepest yellow nods where its lavender cousin is drooping its\r\n     lately proud head. New bell-flowers of white and blue and\r\n     indigo rise above the first, which served merely as ushers to\r\n     the display, and whole acres ablaze with the orange of the\r\n     poppy are fast turning with the indigo of the larkspur. Where\r\n     the ground was lately aglow with the marigold and the\r\n     four-o'clock the tall penstemon now reaches out a hundred arms\r\n     full-hung with trumpets of purple and pink. Here the silene\r\n     rears high its head with fringed corolla of scarlet; and there\r\n     the wild gooseberry dazzles the eye with a perfect shower of\r\n     tubular flowers of the same bright color. The mimulus alone is\r\n     almost enough to color the hills. Half a dozen varieties, some\r\n     with long, narrow, trumpet-shaped flowers, others with broad\r\n     flaring mouths; some of them tall herbs, and others large\r\n     shrubs, with varying shades of dark red, light red, orange,\r\n     cream-color, and yellow, spangle hill-side, rock-pile, and\r\n     ravine. Among them the morning-glory twines with flowers of\r\n     purest white, new lupins climb over the old ones, and the\r\n     trailing vetch festoons rock and shrub and tree with long\r\n     garlands of crimson, purple, and pink. Over the scarlet of the\r\n     gooseberry or the gold of the high-bush mimulus along the\r\n     hills, the honeysuckle hangs its tubes of richest cream-color,\r\n     and the wild cucumber pours a shower of white over the green\r\n     leaves of the sumach or sage. Snap-dragons of blue and white,\r\n     dandelions that you must look at three or four times to be\r\n     certain what they are, thistles that are soft and tender with\r\n     flowers too pretty for the thistle family, orchids that you may\r\n     try in vain to classify, and sages and mints of which you can\r\n     barely recognize the genera, with cruciferæ, compositæ, and\r\n     what-not, add to the glare and confusion.\r\n\r\n     Meanwhile, the chaparral, which during the long dry season has\r\n     robed the hills in sombre green, begins to brighten with new\r\n     life; new leaves adorn the ragged red arms of the manzanita,\r\n     and among them blow thousands of little urn-shaped flowers of\r\n     rose-color and white. The bright green of one lilac is almost\r\n     lost in a luxuriance of sky-blue blossoms, and the white lilac\r\n     looks at a distance as if drifted over with snow. The\r\n     cercocarpus almost rivals the lilac in its display of white and\r\n     blue, and the dark, forbidding adenostoma now showers forth\r\n     dense panicles of little white flowers. Here, too, a new\r\n     mimulus pours floods of yellow light, and high above them all\r\n     the yucca rears its great plume of purple and white.\r\n\r\n     Thus marches on for weeks the floral procession, new turns\r\n     bringing new banners into view, or casting on old ones a\r\n     brighter light, but ever showing a riotous profusion of\r\n     splendor until member after member drops gradually out of the\r\n     ranks, and only a band of stragglers is left marching away into\r\n     the summer. But myriads of ferns, twenty-one varieties of which\r\n     are quite common, and of a fineness and delicacy rarely seen\r\n     elsewhere, still stand green in the shade of the rocks and\r\n     trees along the hills, and many a flower lingers in the timber\r\n     or cañons long after its friends on the open hills or plains\r\n     have faded away. In the cañons and timber are also many flowers\r\n     that are not found in the open ground, and as late as the\r\n     middle of September, only twenty miles from the sea, and at an\r\n     elevation of but fifteen hundred feet, I have gathered bouquets\r\n     that would attract immediate attention anywhere. The whole land\r\n     abounds with flowers both curious and lovely; but those only\r\n     have been mentioned which force themselves upon one's\r\n     attention. Where the sheep have not ruined all beauty, and the\r\n     rains have been sufficient, they take as full possession of the\r\n     land as the daisy and wild carrot do of some Eastern meadows.\r\n     There are thousands of others, which it would be a hopeless\r\n     task to enumerate, which are even more numerous than most of\r\n     the favorite wild flowers are in the East, yet they are not\r\n     abundant enough to give character to the country. For instance,\r\n     there is a great larkspur, six feet high, with a score of\r\n     branching arms, all studded with spurred flowers of such\r\n     brilliant red that it looks like a fountain of strontium fire;\r\n     but you will not see it every time you turn around. A tall lily\r\n     grows in the same way, with a hundred golden flowers shining on\r\n     its many arms, but it must be sought in certain places. So the\r\n     tiger-lily and the columbine must be sought in the mountains,\r\n     the rose and sweetbrier on low ground, the night-shades and the\r\n     helianthus in the timbered cañons and gulches.\r\n\r\n     Delicacy and brilliancy characterize nearly all the California\r\n     flowers, and nearly all are so strange, so different from the\r\n     other members of their families, that they would be an ornament\r\n     to any greenhouse. The alfileria, for instance, is the richest\r\n     and strongest fodder in the world. It is the main-stay of the\r\n     stock-grower, and when raked up after drying makes excellent\r\n     hay; yet it is a geranium, delicate and pretty, when not too\r\n     rank.\r\n\r\n     But suddenly the full blaze of color is gone, and the summer is\r\n     at hand. Brown tints begin to creep over the plains; the wild\r\n     oats no longer ripple in silvery waves beneath the sun and\r\n     wind; and the foxtail, that shone so brightly green along the\r\n     hill-side, takes on a golden hue. The light lavender tint of\r\n     the chorizanthe now spreads along the hills where the poppy so\r\n     lately flamed, and over the dead morning-glory the dodder\r\n     weaves its orange floss. A vast army of cruciferæ and compositæ\r\n     soon overruns the land with bright yellow, and numerous\r\n     varieties of mint tinge it with blue or purple; but the greater\r\n     portion of the annual vegetation is dead or dying. The distant\r\n     peaks of granite now begin to glow at evening with a soft\r\n     purple hue; the light poured into the deep ravines towards\r\n     sundown floods them with a crimson mist; on the shady\r\n     hill-sides the chaparral looks bluer, and on the sunny\r\n     hill-sides is a brighter green than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE TEMPERATURE AROUND THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe following table, published by the Pasadena Board of Trade, shows the\r\ncomparative temperature of well-known places in various parts of the\r\nworld, arranged according to the difference between their average winter\r\nand average summer:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlace.                 | Winter.| Spring.| Summer.| Autumn.| Difference\r\n                       |        |        |        |        |  Summer,\r\n                       |        |        |        |        |  Winter.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFunchal, Madeira       | 62.88  | 64.55  | 70.89  | 70.19  |  8.01\r\nSt. Michael, Azores    | 57.83  | 61.17  | 68.33  | 62.33  | 10.50\r\nPASADENA               | 56.00  | 61.07  | 67.61  | 62.31  | 11.61\r\nSanta Cruz, Canaries   | 64.65  | 68.87  | 76.68  | 74.17  | 12.03\r\nSanta Barbara          | 54.29  | 59.45  | 67.71  | 63.11  | 13.42\r\nNassau, Bahama Islands | 70.67  | 77.67  | 86.00  | 80.33  | 15.33\r\nSan Diego, California  | 54.09  | 60.14  | 69.67  | 64.63  | 15.58\r\nCadiz, Spain           | 52.90  | 59.93  | 70.43  | 65.35  | 17.53\r\nLisbon, Portugal       | 53.00  | 60.00  | 71.00  | 62.00  | 18.00\r\nMalta                  | 57.46  | 62.76  | 78.20  | 71.03  | 20.74\r\nAlgiers                | 55.00  | 66.00  | 77.00  | 60.00  | 22.00\r\nSt Augustine, Florida  | 58.25  | 68.69  | 80.36  | 71.90  | 22.11\r\nRome, Italy            | 48.90  | 57.65  | 72.16  | 63.96  | 23.26\r\nSacramento, California | 47.92  | 59.17  | 71.19  | 61.72  | 23.27\r\nMentone                | 49.50  | 60.00  | 73.00  | 56.60  | 23.50\r\nNice, Italy            | 47.88  | 56.23  | 72.26  | 61.63  | 24.44\r\nNew Orleans, Louisiana | 56.00  | 69.37  | 81.08  | 69.80  | 25.08\r\nCairo, Egypt           | 58.52  | 73.58  | 85.10  | 71.48  | 26.58\r\nJacksonville, Florida  | 55.02  | 68.88  | 81.93  | 62.54  | 96.91\r\nPau, France            | 41.86  | 54.06  | 70.72  | 57.39  | 28.86\r\nFlorence, Italy        | 44.30  | 56.00  | 74.00  | 60.70  | 29.70\r\nSan Antonio, Texas     | 52.74  | 70.48  | 83.73  | 71.56  | 30.99\r\nAiken, South Carolina  | 45.82  | 61.32  | 77.36  | 61.96  | 31.54\r\nFort Yuma, California  | 57.96  | 73.40  | 92.07  | 75.66  | 34.11\r\nVisalia, California    | 45.38  | 59.40  | 80.78  | 60.34  | 35.40\r\nSanta Fé, New Mexico   | 30.28  | 50.06  | 70.50  | 51.34  | 40.22\r\nBoston, Mass           | 28.08  | 45.61  | 68.68  | 51.04  | 40.60\r\nNew York, N.

Of these 120 there were but 41 on which it passed\r\n     85°, but 22 when it passed 90°, but four over 95°, and only one\r\n     over 100°; to wit, 101°, the highest ever recorded here. During\r\n     all this time there was not a day on which the mercury did not\r\n     fall to at least 70° during the night, and there were but five\r\n     days on which it did not fall even lower. During the same ten\r\n     years there were but six days on which the mercury fell below\r\n     35°. This low temperature comes only in extremely dry weather\r\n     in winter, and lasts but a few minutes, happening just before\r\n     sunrise. On two of these six days it fell to 32° at daylight,\r\n     the lowest point ever registered here. The lowest mid-day\r\n     temperature is 52°, occurring only four times in these ten\r\n     years.

Y.\r\n\r\nIt is a book of solid value, such as a clear-headed business man will\r\nappreciate, yet it is such a book as only an accomplished man of letters\r\ncould write. We commend it to all who wish further knowledge of a region\r\ntoo little known by Americans.--_Examiner_, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Little Journey in the World.\r\n\r\nA Novel.

Mr. Warner has depicted this phase of\r\nsociety with real power, and there are passages in his work which are a\r\nnearer approach to Thackeray than we have had from any American\r\nauthor.--_Boston Post._\r\n\r\nThe vigor and vividness of the tale and its sustained interest are not\r\nits only or its chief merits. It is a study of American life of to-day,\r\npossessed with shrewd insight and fidelity.--GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudies in the South and West.\r\n\r\nWith Comments on Canada. Post 8vo, Half Leather, Uncut Edges and Gilt\r\nTop, $1 75.\r\n\r\nA witty, instructive book, as brilliant in its pictures as it is warm in\r\nits kindness; and we feel sure that it is with a patriotic impulse that\r\nwe say that we shall be glad to learn that the number of its readers\r\nbears some proportion to its merits and its power for good.--_N. Y.\r\nCommercial Advertiser._\r\n\r\nA book most charming--a book that no American can fail to enjoy,\r\nappreciate, and highly prize.--_Boston Traveller._\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir Pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nRichly Illustrated by C.

The satire, when there is any, is of\r\nthe mildest, and the general tone is that of one glad to look on the\r\nbrightest side of the cheerful, pleasure-seeking world.--_Christian\r\nUnion_, N.

Y. Evening Post._\r\n\r\nMr. Nordhoff supplies copious appendices, giving tables of temperature,\r\nrainfall and other meteorological facts of much interest. His book is\r\ninteresting, valuable, and timely.--_Epoch_, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe reading of this volume has been of special personal pleasure to us,\r\nand we doubt not that others will enjoy it too.--_Michigan Christian\r\nAdvocate._\r\n\r\nThe book is one that those who read merely for information will find\r\ninteresting and instructive, while there are doubtless many by whom its\r\neconomical representations will be accepted in the way that Mr. Nordhoff\r\nevidently hopes that they will be.--_Philadelphia Telegraph._\r\n\r\nThis opportune little volume will do much to enlighten us as to its real\r\ncharacter, an enlightenment of a most practical kind.--_Geographical\r\nNews._\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Nordhoff has added considerably to our knowledge of a\r\ncountry singularly neglected.--_N. Y. Sun._\r\n\r\nMr. Nordhoff's book is as good as a trip to the place.--_Philadelphia\r\nAmerican._\r\n\r\nHis book is historical, descriptive, and practical, containing\r\ninformation about land-titles and other matters such as settlers and\r\ninvestors will find most useful.--_Cincinnati Times._\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a question that one contemplating purchase or residence\r\nthere would wish to ask that is not answered in this book, while to all\r\nit furnishes interesting and no doubt authentic information concerning a\r\nremarkable region, of which not much has been generally known\r\nheretofore.--_Christian Intelligencer_, N.
