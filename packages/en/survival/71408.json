Anderson and Clenton E. Owensby[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon names of plants often vary widely from place to place, even\r\nwithin rather limited areas. Frequently-occurring and widely-known\r\nspecies may have local names, or the same name may be used for several\r\nspecies. Common names, therefore, often fail to identify plants\r\naccurately. That makes it difficult to communicate about plants; the\r\nconfusion may even discontinue attempts to convey ideas about the\r\nsubject. Conversations may shift to a subject with an adequate common\r\nnomenclature.\r\n\r\nScientific names are essential in formal writing. When common names are\r\nto be used, as in less formal publications, scientific names must also\r\nbe given either at the place where the common ones first appear in the\r\npaper, in a footnote, or in an appended list. Only scientific names\r\nidentify the species for all readers. In completely informal writing\r\nfor a broad area, scientific names may be omitted.\r\n\r\nSince common names are so widely used, they should be used as uniformly\r\nas possible. The following common names are considered “standardized”\r\nfor all writing in the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station and may\r\nalso be used as a guide in teaching. A single common name is given to\r\neach plant listed if it has such a name.\r\n\r\nThis list grew from an earlier Kansas list of grasses and legumes that\r\nemphasized chiefly range and pasture plants. It is extended here to\r\ninclude most plant families and genera that occur in Kansas and many\r\nspecies that do not necessarily occur in Kansas but may be important or\r\nclosely related to those listed. Obviously, not all Kansas plants could\r\nbe included, and therefore many minor plants have been omitted. Species\r\nnot obviously important had to be somewhat arbitrary. Perhaps certain\r\nspecies listed could have been omitted and others not included might\r\nhave been added. The list can, therefore, grow or be altered as need\r\nfor change is shown. If further information on common names is needed,\r\nthe Kelsey and Dayton 1942 edition of Standardized Plant Names[3]\r\nshould be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Genus Common Names=\r\n\r\nIn preparing this list, we attempted to give a single common name to\r\neach genus and to use it in connection with common names for each\r\nof the species listed under that genus. For example, brome for the\r\ngenus, _Bromus_, and various species such as smooth brome and hairy\r\nbrome. Thus, there are two words for species names. However, common\r\nnames of some species are single words and may not bear the generic\r\nname at all; for example, switchgrass, curlymesquite, catchflygrass,\r\ndarnel, needleandthread, berseem, and horsebean. Some genera have\r\nmore than one common name, but in that case the genus is subdivided\r\ninto different types, each with its own common name. For example,\r\nmost species of the genus _Panicum_ are called panicum, but certain\r\nothers are witchgrass; _Melica_ is melic, but bulbous species of that\r\ngenus are called oniongrass; and _Setaria_ is bristlegrass, but the\r\nname millet is applied to certain ones. Some poisonous species of\r\n_Astragalus_ are called loco, but nonpoisonous ones are milkvetch and\r\nthe selenium-gathering ones, poisonvetch. In a few cases the same\r\ncommon name is applied to two genera, but that generally occurs only\r\nwhen the genera involved are closely related. They may formerly have\r\nbeen considered a single genus.\r\n\r\nThe words tree, grass, bean, seed, etc. are combined with key words\r\nto make common names of many genera and species. Examples of the\r\nformer are dropseed, cupgrass, tanglehead, peavine, wildindigo,\r\ncoffeetree, and sensitivebriar; and of the latter, breadroot scurfpea,\r\nsplitbeard bluestem, shortawn foxtail, and smoothseed wildbean.\r\nHyphens are avoided except in a few cases where they are used to make\r\nspelling, meaning, or pronunciation more clearly understood. Some\r\nexamples are s-curve threeawn, blue-eyedgrass, climbing-buckwheat,\r\ndutchmans-breeches, snow-on-the-mountain, fat-hen saltbrush,\r\nfalse-alyssum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Species Common Names=\r\n\r\nThe common name for an individual species is a contraction of the\r\ngenus common name and, in most cases, a descriptive adjective for a\r\nparticular species. An example is the common name for _Bromus inermis_\r\nThe common name for the genus is brome and the descriptive adjective\r\nassociated with the species name _inermis_ is smooth, hence smooth\r\nbrome is the common name for that species.\r\n\r\nIn many cases a satisfactory common name did not exist for a particular\r\nspecies, yet the species name’s English meaning described the plant\r\nwell. Such plants were given common names based on the meaning of\r\ntheir species name. An example is _Lygodesmia rostrata_. It has no\r\nsatisfactory common name. In this publication it is called beaked\r\nskeletonplant, based on the English meaning of _rostrata_ and the\r\naccepted common name for the genus, skeletonplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Capitalization=\r\n\r\nIn general, capitals are avoided for common plant names. They are not\r\nused where proper nouns are combined with such words as grass, tree,\r\nbean, etc., for example, bermudagrass, indiangrass, johnsongrass, but\r\nare used when the name is that of a country, state, or other place\r\nand is a separate word as in Virginia wildrye, Texas bean, California\r\nburclover, and Missouri milkvetch. They are not used, however, when\r\nthe name is derived from a man’s name; for example, lambert crazyweed,\r\ndillen tickclover, chewings fescue, and lehmann lovegrass. Capitals\r\nare, of course, used for proper names of strains or varieties, but such\r\nusage is beyond the scope of this list. The few exceptions to all of\r\nthese “rules” are dictated by firmly established usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Authorities=\r\n\r\nTo identify each species as definitely as possible, authorities are\r\ngiven for scientific names. Authorities for grass names are from\r\nHitchcock’s 1951 manual.[4] The others were compiled from various\r\nsources by Dr. L. C. Hulbert, Department of Botany, Kansas State\r\nUniversity, chiefly from these sources: Gray’s Manual, 8th ed.,[5]\r\nThe New Illustrated Britton and Brown,[6] and Harrington’s Manual.[7]\r\nOccasionally other sources were used for a few or for single species.\r\n\r\nSince authorities were taken directly from the various sources\r\nwithout change, some differences in abbreviation occur. For example,\r\nHitchcock’s manual abbreviates Humboldt, Bonpland, and Kunth as H.B.K.,\r\nwhile most other manuals consulted use HBK. Certain other names may be\r\nspelled fully in one manual and abbreviated in others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Common Name Sources=\r\n\r\nSeveral workers helped with selecting plants to be included and common\r\nnames for them. For the most part, the common names are those used in\r\nKelsey and Dayton, Standardized Plant Names (SPN).[8] However, common\r\nnames of some species are so different and are so firmly entrenched\r\nin common usage that the names given in SPN could not be used in this\r\nlist. An example is “broomsedge” for _Andropogon virginicus_. In SPN\r\nit is “yellowsedge bluestem,” a name never heard in the area this list\r\nserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =ACKNOWLEDGMENTS=\r\n\r\nAppreciation is expressed to those who aided in selecting both plants\r\nand their common names:\r\n\r\nThe late F.

Those in bold are surrounded by equal signs, =like this=.\r\nFootnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to the end of\r\nthe section in which the anchor occurs. Footnotes [9], [11], [18],\r\n[19], [22], and [32] have multiple anchors. Obvious printing errors,\r\nsuch as backwards, upside down, or partially printed letters and\r\npunctuation, were corrected. Letters in reversed order and several\r\nitalics mark-ups were corrected. Final stops missing at the end of\r\nabbreviations were added.\r\n\r\nWords may have multiple spelling variations or inconsistent\r\nhyphenation in the text. These have been left unchanged unless\r\nindicated below. Obsolete and alternative spellings were left\r\nunchanged. Misspelled words were not corrected. In the lists of common\r\nnames, names are often run together, as in climbingmilkweed and\r\nrattlesnakefern; these were not changed.\r\n\r\nThe following was changed: “small-loaved” to “small-leaved.”",
