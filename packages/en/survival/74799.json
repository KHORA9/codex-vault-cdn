S.\r\n\r\n  Sept. 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born on a sheep ranch in California, the San Justo, near San Juan\r\nBautista, an old mission town of the Spanish padres, which stands in\r\nthe lovely San Benito Valley, over the hills from Monterey and about a\r\nhundred miles south of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe gold days were gone and the time of fruit and small farms had not\r\nyet come. On the rolling hills the sheep went softly, and in vacant\r\nvalleys cropped the lush verdure of the springtime, or, in summer,\r\nsought a scanty sustenance in the sun-dried grasses.\r\n\r\nIntrepid men had pushed the railroad through the forbidding barrier of\r\nthe Sierras, giving for the first time easy access to California, and\r\nthus making inevitable a changed manner of life and conditions.\r\n\r\nI am a child of California, a grand-child of Maine, and a\r\ngreat-grand-child of Massachusetts. Fashions in ancestry change. When\r\nI chose mine straight American was still very correct; so I might as\r\nwell admit at once that I am of American colonial stock, Massachusetts\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nUp in the branches of my ancestral tree I find a normal number of\r\nfarmers, sea-captains, small manufacturers, squires, justices of the\r\npeace, and other town officers, members of the general court, privates\r\nin the militia, majors, colonels, one ghost, one governor, and seven\r\npassengers on that early emigrant ship, the Mayflower; but a great\r\nshortage of ministers, there being only one.\r\n\r\nHow I happened to be born so far away from the home of my ancestors,\r\nthe type of life lived here on the frontier by a transplanted New\r\nEngland family, and the conditions that prevailed in California in the\r\nperiod between the mining rush and the tourist rush, is the story I\r\nshall tell.\r\n\r\nThe usual things had happened down the years on the east\r\ncoast,--births, marryings, many children, death; new generations,\r\nscatterings, the settling and the populating a new land. Mother’s\r\npeople stayed close to their original Plymouth corner, but father’s had\r\nfrequently moved on to new frontiers. They went into Maine about the\r\ntime of the Revolution, when it was still a wilderness, and then, by\r\nthe middle of the next century, they were all through the opening west.\r\n\r\nMy father was Llewellyn Bixby of Norridgewock, Maine, and my mother\r\nwas Mary Hathaway, youngest daughter of Reverend George Whitefield\r\nHathaway, my one exception to the non-ministerial rule of the family.\r\nAnd he was this by force of his very determined mother, Deborah\r\nWinslow, who had made up her mind that her handsome young son should\r\nenter the profession at that time the most respected in the community.\r\nShe was a woman called “set as the everlasting hills,” and so\r\ndetermined was she that Whitefield should not be lured off into ways of\r\nbusiness that she would not allow him to be taught arithmetic. Like\r\nthe usual boy he rebelled at dictation, and when at Brown University\r\nbecame a leader in free-thinking circles, but suddenly was converted\r\nand accepted his mother’s dictum. His own choice would have been to\r\nfollow in the footsteps of his father, Washington Hathaway, a graduate\r\nof Brown and a lawyer. His sermons showed his inheritance of a legal\r\nmind, and he exhibited always a tolerance and breadth of spirit that\r\nwere doubtless due to the tempering of his mother’s orthodoxy by his\r\ngentle father’s unitarianism. She, dear lady, would not have her\r\nlikeness made by the new daguerreotype process lest she break the\r\ncommand, “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, nor any\r\nlikeness of anything--.”\r\n\r\nGrandfather graduated from Williams College and Andover Seminary and\r\naccepted the call to the parish church of Bloomfield (Skowhegan),\r\nMaine, which position he held for a generation. Afterward he was\r\nseveral times member of the Maine Legislature and was, during the Civil\r\nWar, chaplain in the 19th Regiment of Maine Volunteers. When I was\r\nstill a child he came to California and spent the last years of his\r\nlife in our home.\r\n\r\nMy father’s family had been in Maine for a longer time, his two\r\ngreat grandfathers, Samuel Bixby and Joseph Weston, going in from\r\nMassachusetts about 1770, and settling on the Kennebec River. Joseph\r\nWeston took his eleven year old son with him in the spring to find a\r\nlocation and prepare for his family to come in the fall. In September\r\nhe left his boy and another of fourteen in charge of the cattle and\r\ncabin and went home to get his wife and other children. But he was\r\nbalked in his purpose because of the setting in of an early winter and\r\nconsequent freezing of the river highway. The boys had to stay alone in\r\nthe woods caring for the cattle until spring made travel possible. When\r\nthe family arrived they found the boys and cattle in good shape, the\r\nboys evidently being excellent Yankee pioneers.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century Somerset County was full of\r\nBixbys and Westons. When Rufus Bixby entertained at Thanksgiving dinner\r\non one occasion he had one hundred fifty-six guests, all kinfolk. He\r\nwas a brother of my grandfather, Amasa Bixby, the two of them having\r\nmarried sisters, Betsey and Fanny Weston. A third sister, Electa\r\nWeston, married William Reed Flint and became the mother of the two\r\ncousins who were father’s business associates all during his California\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe Maine farms were becoming crowded and there was no land in the\r\nneighborhood left for the young folks. Father was one of an even\r\nhundred grandchildren of Benjamin Weston and Anna Powers, a sample of\r\nthe prevalent size of families at that time. The early American farmers\r\nwere not essentially of the soil, but were driven by the necessities of\r\na new country to wring support from the land. At the first opportunity\r\nto escape into callings where more return for less physical output\r\npromised, they fled the farms. I remember that my uncle Jotham who had\r\nrather short stumpy fingers used to maintain that he had worn them\r\ndown in his boyhood gathering up stones in the home pastures and piling\r\nthem into walls.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1851, Llewellyn Bixby, an erect, square-shouldered\r\nyoung man of twenty-five, with gray eyes and black hair, was studying\r\nengineering at Waterville. He had finished his education at a district\r\nschool and Bloomfield Academy some time before and had taught, had\r\nfarmed, had even undertaken the business of selling books from house to\r\nhouse, for which latter effort he confessed he did not seem to have the\r\nrequisite qualities. He then determined to go into engineering, a field\r\nof growing opportunity, and was well underway when one day his father\r\nappeared unexpectedly at the door of a shop where he was at work, with\r\nthe proposal that he join his brother, Amasa, Jr., and his cousin, Dr.\r\nThomas Flint, in a trip to California, whither the latter’s brother,\r\nBenjamin, had gone in 1849.\r\n\r\nThe plan appealed to him and he returned to Norridgewock with his\r\nfather, to make an immediate start for that far off coast which was to\r\nprove his home for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nIt was July, 1851, just too late to be technically called pioneers,\r\nthat they reached San Francisco, but to all intents and purposes they\r\nbelong to that group of early comers to this state who have had so\r\nlarge a part in determining its destiny.\r\n\r\nThe next year, two more of my father’s brothers, Marcellus and Jotham,\r\nventured around the Horn, and ultimately the rest of the children\r\nfollowed,--Amos, Henry, Solomon, George, Francina and Nancy, (Mrs.\r\nWilliam Lovett), making in all eight brothers and two sisters. Amos who\r\nwas the last to come, was a lawyer and editor and had been instrumental\r\nin the founding of Grinnell College in Iowa and the University of\r\nColorado in Boulder as he made his gradual progress from Maine to\r\nCalifornia. He founded and edited the first newspaper in Long Beach.\r\n\r\nAllen Bixby, now state commander of the American Legion is the grandson\r\nof Amasa, the brother who accompanied my father in the first trip\r\nacross the isthmus. It is this sort of bodily transplanting of young\r\nstock that has left so many of the New England counties bereft of\r\nformer names, but has built up in new communities many of the customs\r\nand traditions of the older civilization.\r\n\r\nNot only did my father’s immediate family come to this state but also\r\nmany of his friends and cousins. I am told that at the presidential\r\nelection in 1860 all the men in Paso Robles who voted for Lincoln came\r\nfrom Somerset county, Maine.\r\n\r\nBecause this migration is typical and because many of these cousins\r\nmade names for themselves beyond the limits of the family, I am going\r\nto mention a few of them.\r\n\r\nAmong them was, for instance, Dr. Mary Edmands, who was an early\r\nphysician in San Francisco in the days when it took grit as well as\r\nbrains for a woman to gain a medical education. She succeeded as a\r\nmother as well as a professional woman, her sons and daughter at\r\npresent standing high in their respective callings.\r\n\r\nNathan Blanchard of Santa Paula was a son of still another Weston\r\nsister. He, after many hardships and almost unbelievable patience,\r\nsucceeded in making a success of lemon culture in Southern California,\r\nand worked out the fundamental principle of curing the fruit that is\r\nnow in vogue wherever lemons are grown for market.\r\n\r\nAnother name widely known is that of Mrs. Frank Gibson, the daughter of\r\nanother cousin. She has been a leader among women for many years, and\r\nmember of the State Board of Immigration. Her son, Hugh Gibson, is at\r\npresent United States Minister to Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the several hundred from this one Maine family\r\nwho are scattered up and down this western land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II THE VERY LITTLE GIRL\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born, as I have said, on a sheep ranch in the central part of\r\nCalifornia during its pastoral period, but it is doubtless true that\r\nthe environment and influences about me during the first few months of\r\nmy life were very little different from what they would have been had\r\nmy Maine mother not left her New England home about a year before my\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nBut as the months passed and the circle of my experience widened, I was\r\nmore and more affected by the conditions of my own time and place.\r\n\r\nMy first memory relates to an experience characteristic of a frontier\r\ncountry in which the manner of life is still primitive. I remember\r\nvery distinctly sitting in my mother’s lap in a stage-coach and being\r\nunbearably hot and thirsty. After I was a grown girl my father took\r\nme with him to inspect the last remaining link of the old stage lines\r\n(between Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez), that formally ran up and down\r\nthe state from San Diego to San Francisco, and I, being reminded of\r\nthat long ride in my babyhood, asked him about it. He told me that\r\non the return trip to San Juan after my first visit to Los Angeles,\r\ninstead of going north by steamer they had traveled by stage through\r\nthe San Joaquin Valley, encountering the worst heat he had ever\r\nexperienced in California. Then he added that I could not possibly\r\nremember anything about it since I was only eleven months old when it\r\nhappened. I maintain, however, that I do, because the picture and the\r\nsense of heat is too vivid to be a matter of hearsay alone. I was so\r\nsmall that my head came below my mother’s shoulder as I leaned against\r\nher outside arm at the left end of the middle seat. There were no other\r\nwomen in the stage, papa was behind us, and opposite were three men,\r\nwho were sorry for me and talked to me.\r\n\r\nThe months went by and I came to know my home. It was among rolling\r\nhills whose velvety slopes bounded my world. Over all was the wide\r\nblue sky, a bit of it having fallen into a nearby hollow. This was a\r\nfascinating pond, for water ran up hill beside the road to get into\r\nit. Then there were many fish, none of which ever would get caught on\r\nmy bent-pin hook. It was into this water that I once saw some little\r\nducks jump, and, like many of the younger generation, greatly alarm\r\ntheir mother, who, being a hen, had no understanding of her children’s\r\nadjustment to strange conditions.\r\n\r\nThe ranch house was a new one, built by the three partner-cousins,\r\nlarge enough to accommodate their families. It was reminiscent of\r\nMaine, with its white paint, green blinds and sharp gables edged with\r\nwooden lace, something like the perforated paper in the boxes of\r\nperfumed toilet soap,--perhaps meant to remind them of icicles. The\r\nhouse and all the auxiliary buildings were built on rising ground, so\r\nthat under each one, on the lower side, was a high basement, usually\r\nenclosed by a lattice. Under the veranda that extended across the\r\nfront of the house was a fine place to play, with many treasures to be\r\nfound, among them sacks of the strange beet seed, reminders of an early\r\ninterest in sugar-making, and sweet potatoes that are very good for\r\nnibbling, raw; they taste like chestnuts.\r\n\r\nAt the rear of this house was a low porch, without a railing, where\r\nthe carriages drove up many times a day, for, with the large family,\r\nthe wide acres, and active business, there was much coming and going.\r\nThis veranda served as an annex to the dining room. In those days fruit\r\ncame after breakfast instead of before, and it was here that we ate it,\r\ntossing the squeezed oranges and the scalloped watermelon rinds into a\r\nconveniently placed box that was frequently emptied.\r\n\r\nDirectly back of the kitchen was a small building containing a\r\nstoreroom where Dick and I were accustomed to climb the shelves like a\r\nladder for packages of sweet chocolate, while Aunt Francina, oblivious,\r\nskimmed the many large milk pans. In the building also was a laundry,\r\ncontaining a stove upon which I have seen soft-soap made and tallow\r\nprepared for the candle moulds. In a corner, made by this house and a\r\nretaining wall, was a large sand pile, and from the great oak on the\r\nbank above hung a long swing. I wonder if it is any more delightful for\r\nan old person to penetrate the sky in an aeroplane than for a little\r\ngirl to do the same when pushed by the strong arm of her father.\r\n\r\nDown towards the pond was the horse barn, with its long rows of stalls\r\non one side, and its shelter for the carts and buggies beside the\r\nhay-mow on the other. I was warned of dangerous heels and was duly\r\ncircumspect, but liked to get, occasionally, a nice, fresh, long hair\r\nfrom a tail for purposes of scientific experiment. I was going to turn\r\na hair into a snake if possible. In a similar attempt to verify popular\r\nstatements I spent many an hour with salt in my hand, trailing birds.\r\n\r\nOn one of my ventures behind the horses I was rewarded by the discovery\r\nof a very heavy little bottle, standing on a dark ledge. It contained\r\nmercury. Great was my joy to get a few drops in my hand, to divide them\r\ninto the tiniest globules, and then to watch them coalesce into one\r\nlittle silvery pool.\r\n\r\nThe building standing back up the hill was the one in which the\r\nimported Spanish merino sheep were kept. I seldom went there, but in\r\nthe corral behind the barn next lower several cows stood every night\r\nto be milked, among them Old Muley, my friend, on whose broad back I\r\noften sat astride while the process was going on. There were large,\r\npink-blossomed mallows bordering the fences and this barn, and under\r\nthe latter many white geese could be seen between the slats of the open\r\nsiding. How excited I was when the day for gathering the feathers came!\r\n\r\nThe hired men occupied the original ranch house; in the usual basement\r\nwas the tool room, open to us children. I here learned to hammer,\r\nsaw and plane, and, most charming of all, bore holes with an auger in\r\nthe wooden boxes we used in the making of figure-four traps. I also\r\nlearned about gimlets, chisels, pliers, brads, rivets, and screws and\r\nthus prepared myself to be a general handy man at college and in my own\r\nhome. It was in this shop that papa made me a fire-cracker holder,--a\r\nwillow stick with a hole bored in one end in which to place the lovely\r\nred symbol of patriotism, so that I could celebrate without endangering\r\nmy fingers.\r\n\r\nIn front of the house was the flower garden, enclosed by a white picket\r\nfence as a protection against chickens and other wandering ranch\r\nanimals. Ladies-delights turned up their smiling little faces beside\r\none walk, and nearby grew papa’s favorites, cinnamon pinks. I liked the\r\nred honey-suckle and the dark mourning-brides that were like velvet\r\ncushions stuck full of white-headed pins. There was one orange tree\r\nthat bore no fruit important enough for me to remember, but, in spring,\r\nhad many waxy white blossoms that smelled so good it made one hurt\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nIn larger enclosures, bounded by the same white fencing, grew\r\nvegetables and fruit trees. Sometimes we pulled a pungent horse-radish\r\nroot and pretended that a bite of it made us crazy, an excuse for much\r\nrunning and wild gesticulation. Under a long row of loaded blackberry\r\nvines Dick once asked me the riddle, “Why is a blackberry like a\r\nnewspaper?” Do you know the answer? It is: “Both are black and white\r\nand red all over.” I presume the play upon the word “red” was my\r\nintroduction to puns.\r\n\r\nThe orchard contained peaches, plums, pears, apples, and apricots, but,\r\nto my mind, the cherry trees were the chief glory. One evening while\r\nAnnie Mooney, our nurse, was taking in some clothes from the line, my\r\nlittle sister and I had a feast of fallen cherries, but she ate with\r\nless discrimination than I, for when, a few minutes later, we drank\r\nour supper milk she had convulsions. A quick immersion in a tub of hot\r\nwater cured her, and we had learned about babies and cherries and milk,\r\nall mixed up together.\r\n\r\nDown in the far corner of the orchard was a spring, with marshy ground\r\nabout it, where the children were forbidden to go. But one morning,\r\nbored by the lack of novelty in our lives, one of the Flint twins and I\r\nboldly ventured into the tabooed region. We had hardly arrived when we\r\nsaw an enormous black snake, which drove us back in terror, chasing us,\r\nwith glittering eyes and darting tongue, over the ridges and hollows of\r\nthe new-ploughed ground that clutched at our feet as if in collusion\r\nwith the black dragon guard of the spring. I laid, during those few\r\nminutes, the foundation for many a horror-stricken dream. The snake\r\nwas real. I wonder if the pursuit was merely the imagining of a guilty\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nBeyond the summer house, beyond the fence and at the hilltop end of a\r\nlittle grassy path, was the family burying ground, where, under the\r\nwild flowers, lay a few baby cousins who had gone away before I came,\r\nand papa’s young brother, Solomon, who, while reading poetry in a\r\nlonely sheep camp, had been shot to death by some unknown hand.\r\n\r\nOur home was in a little valley, with no other houses in sight, but\r\na mile and a half away, down a hill and across a bridge, lay the old\r\ntown of San Juan Bautista, with its post-office, store, adobe inn and\r\nits homes, a medley of Spanish and American types. The mission church\r\nwith its long corridor, arched and tile-paved, and its garden, where\r\npeacocks used to walk and drop their shining feathers for a little girl\r\nto pick up, was the dominating feature of the place, its very cause for\r\nbeing. Inside was dim silence; there were strange dark pictures on the\r\nwalls, and burning candles, a very large music book with big square\r\nnotes, and a great Bible, chained to its desk.\r\n\r\nThere was another church in San Juan, one that was wooden, light, bare\r\nand small, where I learned from a tiny flowered card, “Blessed are the\r\npeacemakers,” which, being interpreted for my benefit, meant, “Sallie\r\nmus’n’t quarrel with little sister.” I ate up a rosebud and wriggled in\r\nmy seat during the long sermon and wondered about the lady who brushed\r\nher hair smooth and low on one side and high on the other. Had she only\r\none ear?\r\n\r\nI have been told that my church attendance involved certain\r\ndistractions for my fellow-worshippers, and that my presence was\r\ntolerated only because of the desirability of training me in correct\r\nSunday habits. On one occasion my restlessness led me into disaster. My\r\nparents had gone to the chancel, carrying my little sister Anne for\r\nher christening, leaving me in the pew. It was a strange performance.\r\nThe minister took the baby in his arms, and then put something from a\r\nsilver bowl on her forehead, and began to pray. I must know what was in\r\nthe bowl! Everybody had shut-eyes, so there was a good chance for me\r\nto find out without troubling anyone. I darted forward and managed to\r\ndiscover that the mysterious something was water, for I spilled it over\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThe trip to church was made in a two-seated, low carriage, with a span\r\nof horses, while my every day rides with papa were in a single buggy,\r\nbut with two horses, also, for we had far to go and liked going fast.\r\nSometimes we went to Gilroy, and sometimes to Hollister, often just\r\nabout the ranch to the various sheep camps, which were widely separated.\r\n\r\nI began these business trips almost as soon as I was old enough to sit\r\nup alone. When we started I would be very erect and alert at papa’s\r\nside, but before long I would droop and be retired to the bottom of\r\nthe buggy, where, wrapped in a robe, and with his foot for a pillow,\r\nI would sleep contentedly for hours. I remember my disgust when I had\r\ngrown so long that I must change my habit and put my legs back under\r\nthe seat, instead of lying across in the correct way. I objected to\r\nchange, but was persuaded that it would be inconvenient for me to get\r\ntangled, during some pleasant dream, in the actualities of the spokes\r\nof a moving wheel.\r\n\r\nAt one time papa and I were very much occupied clearing a field, a\r\npiece of work which he must have reserved for himself, since there\r\nwere no other men about. He also enjoyed chopping wood and this may\r\nhave been his “daily dozen.” We cut down several large oak trees,\r\ncleared out underbrush, and, piling it up against the great stumps,\r\nbuilt fires that roared for a time and then smouldered for days.\r\n\r\nSometimes I walked with mamma on the hills back of the house, and when\r\nwe were tired we would sit down under a tree and she would tell me a\r\nstory and make me a chaplet of oak leaves, folding and fastening each\r\nleaf to the next in a most ingenious way. If our walk took us into the\r\nlower lands she made bewitching little baskets from the rushes that\r\ngrew near the water’s edge. I also found the strange equisitum, that I\r\nsometimes called “horse-tail,” and sometimes “stove-pipe,” which latter\r\nI preferred, because none of the horses that I knew had disjointable\r\ntails, while the little hollow tubes of stem that fitted into each\r\nother so well must serve the fairies most excellently for their\r\nchimneys.\r\n\r\nSeveral spring mornings as I grew older, I got up at dawn with mamma,\r\nwent to the early empty kitchen for a drink of milk, and then went out\r\nwith her for a horseback ride, she in her long broadcloth habit and\r\nstiff silk hat, and I, a tiny timid girl, perched on a side-saddle atop\r\na great horse. From the point of view of horsemanship I was not a great\r\nsuccess, but the joy of the dawn air, the rising sun, the wild-flowers,\r\nthe companionship of my mother is mine forever.\r\n\r\nIt was on one of these morning expeditions when we were comparing\r\nnotes about our tastes in colors, that I found she liked a strange\r\nshade of red that to me looked unattractive. I was overwhelmed by the\r\nthought that perhaps it did not look the same to both of us, and that\r\nif I saw it as she did I might like it also; but there was no way for\r\neither of us to know how it actually looked to the other! I realized\r\nthe essential isolation of every human being. However, I forgot the\r\nloneliness when papa joined us on the road beside the pond, where the\r\nwild lilac scattered its blue-violet lace on the over-hanging bank, and\r\ncut for me a willow whistle that sounded the shrill joy of being alive.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday afternoon walks when we all went up into the hills\r\ntogether I learned, among other classics:\r\n\r\n  “Little drops of water,\r\n     Little grains of sand,\r\n   Make a mighty ocean\r\n     And the wondrous land.”\r\n\r\nBut it was at night when I was safely put in my bed that I heard\r\nthrough the open door, mamma, at the parlor piano, singing to me:\r\n\r\n  “I want to be an angel,\r\n     And with the angels stand,\r\n   A crown upon my head,\r\n     A harp within my hand.”\r\n\r\nI suppose that neither she nor I were really in immediate haste for\r\nthe fulfillment of that wish, but it made a good bed-time song.\r\nAnother favorite was, _Shall we Gather at the River?_, and there was\r\noccasionally a somber one called _Pass Under the Rod_.\r\n\r\nMy bed was a very safe place, for did not angels guard it, “two at the\r\nfoot, and two at the head”? I knew who my angels were,--my very own\r\ngrandmother, who had died when my mother was a new baby, the aunt for\r\nwhom I had been named, my little cousin Mary who really should have\r\nbeen guarding her brother Harry, and a fourth whom I have now forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe songs were not gay, but my life was not troubled by thoughts of\r\ndeath. Heaven seemed a nice place, somewhere, and angels and fairies\r\nwere normal parts of my universe.\r\n\r\nI did have a few minor troubles. My language was criticized. “You bet\r\nyour boots” did not meet with maternal approval. Then, if I carelessly\r\nput my sunbonnet strings into my mouth, I got my tongue burned from\r\nthe vinegar and cayenne pepper into which they had been dipped for the\r\nexpress purpose of making the process disagreeable. Those sunbonnets,\r\nwith which my head was sheathed every time I started out into the airy\r\nout-of-doors, were my chief pests. I usually compromised my integrity\r\nby untying the strings as soon as I was out of sight. I would double\r\nback the corners of the bonnet, making it into a sort of cocked hat\r\nwith a bow on top, made from the hated strings, thus letting my poor\r\nscratched ears out of captivity.\r\n\r\nMy cousin, Mrs. Gibson, tells me that she also suffered the martyrdom\r\nof sunbonnets; I suppose in those days girls were supposed to preserve\r\nnatural complexions, it not being considered decent to have recourse\r\nto vanity boxes. Her mother was more ingenious than mine in making sure\r\nthat her child did not jeopardize her skin. She made buttonholes in the\r\ntop of the bonnet through which she drew strands of hair and braided\r\nthem outside the bonnet, thus insuring it against removal.\r\n\r\nPapa and I went to the circus on every possible occasion. Once,\r\nat Hollister, I saw General and Mrs. Tom Thumb, Minnie Warren and\r\nCommodore Nutt, whose photograph--with Mr. Barnum--I have preserved.\r\nMinnie Warren was supposed to be the size of a six-year-old, but the\r\nstandard for six-year-olds must have come out of the east. I was\r\nseveral inches taller than she.\r\n\r\nA pretty lady, dressed in pink tarleton skirts, who rode several horses\r\nat a time, and jumped through tissue paper hoops, was my first heroine.\r\nDick and I kept her picture for months on a ledge under the office\r\ndesk, and there rendered her frequent homage.\r\n\r\nThe mention of this desk calls to mind other activities centering in\r\nthat office. On one occasion, when I was suitably young, the spirit\r\nmoved me to carry a shovelful of live coals out through the door to the\r\nporch, and there coax up a fire by the addition of kindling wood. The\r\nsame spirit, or another, however, suggested a compensating action. I\r\nsummoned my mother to see my “nice fire,” to the salvation of the house.\r\n\r\nFire, candles, matches, revolvers, all held a fascination. It is\r\nevident that neither my cousin Harry nor I were intended for a violent\r\ndeath, for it was our custom to investigate from time to time his\r\nfather’s loaded revolver, turning the chambers about and removing\r\nand replacing the cartridges. Our faith in our ability to handle the\r\ndangerous weapon safely seems to have been justified by our success.\r\n\r\nIt was deemed wise to keep me occupied, so far as possible, in order\r\nto thwart Satan, ever on the lockout for idle hands. So I was taught\r\nto sew patch-work and to knit, to read and to spell. There were short\r\nperiods when I had to stay in the house, but like most California\r\nchildren, I spent out of doors most of the time not given over to\r\neating and sleeping. Now-a-days even those duties are attended to upon\r\nporches.\r\n\r\nUnder mamma’s guidance I once laboriously and secretly sewed “over and\r\nover” a gray and striped “comfort bag” for a birthday gift to papa. It\r\nwas modelled on the bags made for the soldiers in the Union army when\r\nmy mother was a girl. We made a special trip to Hollister to buy its\r\ncontents, black and white thread, coarse needles, buttons, wax, blunt\r\nscissors, and to top off, pink and white sugary peppermint drops. That\r\nbag remained in service for twenty years, going always in father’s\r\nsatchel whenever he went away. It came to my rescue once when I had\r\ntorn my skirt from hem to band. As he sewed up the rent for me with\r\nnice big stitches, first on one side and then on the other, he told me\r\nit was a shoemaker’s stitch and had the advantage of bringing the edges\r\ntogether just as they had been originally, without puckering the cloth.\r\nMamma used the same stitch to mend the torn pages of books and sheet\r\nmusic, in those days before Mr. Dennison invented his transparent tape.\r\n\r\nTime went by slowly, slowly, as it does when one is young. All day\r\nthere was play, except for the occasional stint of patchwork, or the\r\nreading lesson,--every day but Sunday, with its church in the forenoon\r\nand stories and walks in the afternoon. Mamma would say, “When I was\r\na little girl in Maine,” until to me Maine meant Paradise. In that\r\ncountry there was a brook where one could wade, and the great river,\r\non whose banks in the woods children could picnic and hunt for wild\r\nberries,--what a charm in the words, “going berrying!” Even the nest\r\nof angry hornets with their sharp stings did not lessen my enthusiasm.\r\nAt San Justo there were no Martha and Susan, no Julia and Ella for me\r\nto play with,--just boys, (who seemed to answer very well for little\r\ntom-boy Sallie when Maine was not in mind).\r\n\r\nWhen I heard of snow and sleighs and sleds and the wonderful attic with\r\nits cunning low curtained windows and the doll colony who lived there,\r\nI forgot the charms of the ranch and the boy play. It was nothing to\r\nme that there were horses and cows, ducks, geese and chickens. It\r\nwas nothing to me that Dick and I could make figure-four traps, and,\r\nwalking beyond the wool-barn, set them on the hillside for quail; that\r\nonce we had the excitement of finding our trap upset, our captives\r\ngone, and great bear tracks all about. The long sunny days of freedom\r\nwith the boys, the great herds of sheep that came up for shearing, the\r\nmany rides with my father through the lovely valleys and over the hills\r\nwere commonplace, just what I had always known. No, life in California\r\nwas very tame compared with the imagined joys of Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III DOWN IN MAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nTwice mamma took me to Maine to see grandmother and grandfather and\r\nAunt Martha, once when I was two-and-a-half years old and once when\r\nI was nearly five. In each case we stayed about six months so that I\r\nbecame acquainted with New England in all its varying seasons.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the being there just when I was forming habits of speech\r\nthat has fastened upon me an unmistakable New England way of speaking,\r\nhowever much the pure dialect may have been corrupted by my usual\r\nwestern environment.\r\n\r\nMy aunt tells me that when she first saw me she could think of nothing\r\nso much as a little frisking squirrel, my dark eyes were so shining\r\nand I darted about so constantly. I couldn’t wait after my arrival at\r\nthe strange place even long enough to take off hood and coat before\r\ndemanding scissors with which to cut paper dolls. When the outer wraps\r\nwere removed, the interested relatives saw a slender little girl, with\r\nstraight yellow hair, brown eyes and a smooth skin, tanned by wind and\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nEvidently there was much excitement attendant upon reaching\r\ngrandmother’s, for when I was tucked away for a nap, with a brand new\r\nbook purchased the day before in Boston to entertain me until sleep\r\nshould come, I occupied myself with tearing every page into pieces the\r\nsize of a quarter. I have no suggestion to offer as to why I did it.\r\nWhen the situation came to adult attention, papa sat down on the trunk\r\nbeside the crib and gave me the only spanking he was ever known to\r\nbestow upon his family. The rope was behind the trunk. I saw it while\r\nlying across his knees.\r\n\r\nThe ill-fated book was not the only purchase made in Boston. Mamma and\r\nI had our pictures taken, and bought clothes for the cold winter ahead.\r\nI had a bottle-green dress and a bottle-green coat to match, also\r\nstockings and bonnet. They put me up on the counter to try the things\r\non me, and I was glad when mamma chose the velvet bonnet with a white\r\nruche and little pink roses, for I liked it best of all. Then there\r\nwere kid gloves, dark green and white, both of which I hated, because\r\nmy poor little fingers buckled when they were put on. When I was taken\r\nto call on the cousins in Beacon Street, I was dressed up in all the\r\nregalia, even to the white gloves. Alas, there was a coping beside the\r\nsteps, just the right height for a hand-rail for me, and unfortunately,\r\ndust is black even in Boston. Missy was in disgrace when she reached\r\nthe front door. She was better adapted to play in mud pies than formal\r\ncalls.\r\n\r\nEven if I liked dirt and freedom, I also liked clothes well enough to\r\nremember those I have had, so that now I would venture to reconstruct\r\na continuous series of them, extending back to babyhood. An early\r\nfavorite was of scarlet cashmere, cut in “Gabrielle” style, with\r\nscalloped neck, sleeves and hem, buttonholed with black silk, and on\r\nthe front an embroidered bunch of barley, acorns and roses. With this\r\ndress went a little white fur overcoat, cap and muff, all trimmed with\r\na narrow edge of black fur. So much for clothes. They were ordinarily\r\nburied under aprons.\r\n\r\nMaine was a wonderful place! The leaves on the trees were red and\r\nyellow, brown and purple, instead of green, and when the wind blew\r\nthey fell off. It left the trees very queer, but the dry leaves on\r\nthe ground made a fine swishing noise when one scuffed in them, and\r\nwhen a little breeze picked them up and sent them scurrying after one\r\nthey looked like the rats following the Pied Piper of Hamelin. Mamma\r\ngathered some of the prettiest, pressed them and waxed them with a hot\r\niron and a paraffine candle. We took them back to San Justo with us and\r\npinned them on the lace curtains, to remind us of Skowhegan.\r\n\r\nWhenever we went to town on an errand or to church, we crossed the\r\nbridge, under which the great river rushed to pour over the falls\r\nbelow, a never failing wonder. On the far side of the island the water\r\nturned the wheels for cousin Levi Weston’s sawmill, an interesting, if\r\ndangerous, place to visit.\r\n\r\nWe had not been long in Maine before the air filled with goose\r\nfeathers, only it wasn’t feathers, but wet snow. Then came sleds\r\nand sleighs, a snow man and Christmas, with a piggy-back ride on\r\ngrandfather to see the tree at the church.\r\n\r\nThe snow was so deep on the ground and it was so cold, the chickens\r\nhad to stay in the barn all the time; every morning grandmother and I\r\ntook my little red bucket and went to feed them, out through the summer\r\nkitchen, the wood-shed, past the horse’s stall to their house.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Maine I learned odors as well as sights. I know the\r\nsmell of snow in the air, of pine trees in winter, of a woodshed and\r\nbarn, of an old house that has been lived in for long, long years. I\r\ncame to know the fragrance of a cellar, apples and butter, vegetables\r\nand preserves, and can recall its clammy coolness.\r\n\r\nTo have a bath in a wash-tub by the kitchen stove was a lark for a\r\nlittle wild-westerner who had known only a modern bathroom. The second\r\ntime we were at grandfather’s there was a curious soft-rubber pouch\r\nfor a tub, which was set up when wanted before the fire in the north\r\nbedroom. The bottom rested on the floor, while the sides were held up\r\nby poles, resting on chairs. After a week-end tubbing, mamma and I\r\nwould say together,\r\n\r\n  “How pleasant is Saturday night\r\n     When all the week I’ve been good,\r\n   Said never a word that was cross\r\n     And done all the good that I could.”\r\n\r\nI have other memories of that fire-place. Once, during the first visit,\r\nmamma left me for a few days in the care of my inexperienced aunt, of\r\nwhom I took advantage. I assured her that my mother every night rubbed\r\nmy chest with camphorated oil and gave me a spoonful of Hive’s cough\r\nsyrup. Evidently I had recently enjoyed a cold. So every night I got\r\nmy oil rub and the sweet sticky dose, and, wrapped in an old shawl\r\nand called a “little brown sausage,” was rocked during some blissful\r\nminutes of story-telling. Mamma was shocked when she returned to find\r\nthe empty bottle and to know the whereabouts of its contents.\r\n\r\nStill another fire-place memory,--papa was taking care of me in this\r\nroom, and was having so good a time reading and smoking that I thought\r\nI would do the same. I climbed up and took from the mantel a pretty\r\ntwisted paper lamp-lighter, then seated myself beside him, put my feet\r\nas high as I could on my side of the fireplace, adjusted my newspaper,\r\nlighted my cigar, and in mouthing it about, managed to set my front\r\nhair on fire. That attracted papa’s attention to his job.\r\n\r\nSoon the time approached for us to be starting west again. Hardly had\r\nwe reached Chicago when there was a dangerous fire in the business\r\nsection; it was not so long after the great fire that people had\r\nforgotten the terror and panic of it. So we must flee the hotel,\r\nalthough papa kept saying that if men would tear up the carpets and\r\nwet them and hang them outside the building they might save it. Mamma\r\ndressed me and packed the trunk as fast as she could, and I went out\r\ninto the hall and looked down the elevator well, where the door had\r\nbeen left open. It was the first chance I had ever had to see what a\r\ndeep hole it was, but mamma called me to come back, and I thought she\r\nwas frightened to see me leaning over and looking down. We went away in\r\nUncle Jo’s buggy through streets filled with pushing shouting people,\r\nand, as we looked back, all the sky was red with fire. We went to a\r\nsmall boarding house over by the lake, and all there was in it was a\r\nred balloon, many mosquitoes and a wonderful talking doll that the dear\r\nuncle brought me.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco came next, a few days at the Grand Hotel, a ride on the\r\noctagonal street car that diagonaled off from Market Street, a visit to\r\nWoodward’s Gardens, and then home by train and stage. It was good after\r\nall to get back to California. Here was our own sitting-room, with its\r\nwhite marble mantel, its dainty flowered carpet and its lace curtains.\r\nOn the wall were colored pictures of Yosemite and a Sunset at Sea, and\r\nengravings of L’Allegro and Il Penseroso, all hanging by crimson cords\r\nwith tassels. I liked the dancing girl better, but mamma preferred the\r\nsad one.\r\n\r\nI was also glad to get back to my old toys, my book about _Ten Little\r\nIndians_, and the boy cousins who lived at the other end of the house.\r\nAnd here, soon, came little sister, who was the cunningest baby that\r\never was. They rolled her up so close in blankets that Aunt Francina\r\nwas afraid she would be smothered. I didn’t want her to be smothered.\r\nWhat a long time it does take for a baby to grow up enough to play with\r\na person born three years ahead of her!\r\n\r\nTwo years later mamma took me and little Anne back again to Maine, for\r\nshe had had letters telling her that grandmother was very ill. It was\r\na harder trip with two children and so my mother planned to simplify\r\nit in every possible way. She invented for us traveling dresses of a\r\nmedium brown serge, with bloomers to match, a whole generation before\r\nsuch dresses came into general favor for little girls. With these,\r\nfewer bags and satchels were necessary, and we looked as well dressed\r\nat the end as at the beginning of the journey; and, moreover, I was\r\nable to stand on my head modestly, whenever I felt like it. I am\r\nglad that I did not have to be mother of restless me on such a long,\r\nconfined trip; I am also glad that restless I had a mother who could\r\ncut out such fascinating paper boxes and tell stories and think of\r\nthousands of things to do. Perhaps having two children to take care of\r\nkept mamma from grieving so much about her mother.\r\n\r\nI realized little about the illness, because, except for a daily\r\ngood-morning call, we children were kept out of the sick room, usually\r\nplaying out-of-doors. We rolled down the grassy slope in the south\r\nyard, or drove about in the low basket phaeton along the winding, shady\r\nroads. Sometimes we had a picnic,--I remember especially the one on my\r\nfifth birthday. Georgie Hill, who helped Aunt Martha with the house\r\nwork, made a wonderful cake, which contained a button, a thimble, a\r\npenny, and a ring; in some very satisfying way, the section containing\r\nthe ring came to me. I had always wanted a ring. I was happy, happy,\r\nand then the very next day I lost it, making mud pies with Annie Allen.\r\nI never had another ring until I was grown up, not even a bracelet,\r\nwhich might have consoled me. But if I had had either I probably would\r\nhave had to suffer the sorrows of separation, since it was my habit to\r\nlose my treasures. My gold pins are sowed up and down the earth; my\r\nsister still has every one she owned. Perhaps it was in recognition of\r\nmy capacity to mislay things, and to encourage stoical acceptance of\r\nthe situation, that led grandfather to write in my autograph album:\r\n\r\n  “My little grand-daughter,\r\n   Just do as you ought to,\r\n   Neither worry nor fret\r\n   At what can’t be mended,\r\n   Nor wait to regret\r\n   Till doing is ended.”\r\n\r\nIt was on this same birthday that Elizabeth came to me, and her I have\r\nnot lost. She was a doll almost as tall as I, that had been made by\r\nmy great-grandmother, Deborah Hathaway, for her son’s little girls.\r\nThe doll came last to my mother, who was the youngest, and from her\r\ndescended to me. Elizabeth had a cloth body, stuffed with cotton, white\r\nkid arms and hands and a papier mache head. She was so unfortunate soon\r\nafter her arrival in California, as to suffer a fracture of the skull,\r\ndue to contact with a hammer wielded by my small sister. Elizabeth\r\nsurvived the grafting on of a china head, and is now eighty or more\r\nyears old, but looking as young as ever.\r\n\r\nI possess many letters written to my father by my mother at this time,\r\nfrom which I can gain ideas regarding what manner of woman she was, to\r\nsupplement my own memory of her whom I lost while still a child.\r\n\r\nI seem to have been something of a puzzle to my gentle mother. I quote\r\nfrom one letter:\r\n\r\n“Sarah ... the strangest child I ever saw ... so affectionate, but\r\nwill not be coaxed ... super-abundance of spirits.... She tries to\r\nremember all the new rules of life. [I was five years old] ... brown\r\neyes. I hope those eyes will not hold a shadow caused by her mother\r\nmisunderstanding her and crushing out in her by sternness anything\r\nsweet and beautiful. I would not want to love her so fondly as to make\r\na foolish, conceited woman of her, but I don’t know that that is any\r\nworse than to give her life a gloomy start.”\r\n\r\nI love this letter. It delights me that my mother, a high-bred New\r\nEngland lady, to whom foolishness and frivolity were anathema, should\r\nprefer even them to harshness and a broken spirit for her little\r\ndaughter. However, her desire to give my life a happy start was not\r\nincompatible with good discipline. She expected obedience and got it,\r\nsometimes in very ingenious ways. On one occasion when I had been\r\nfretful--“whining” she called it,--she suggested that as I was usually\r\na good girl and did what she wanted it must be that I was really unable\r\nto improve my voice, that my throat must be rusty and in need of oil to\r\ncure the squeak, so she proceeded to grease the inside of it with olive\r\noil applied on the end of a stripped white feather. Do you wonder that\r\nit was years before I learned to like French salad dressing, with its\r\nreminder of disordered vocal chords?\r\n\r\nIn the later summer grandmother died, but as we had seen so little of\r\nher and were kept away from the evidences and symbols of death, it did\r\nnot make much impression upon us.\r\n\r\nWe stayed on in Skowhegan until papa was free to come to Maine for us.\r\nIn the meantime both mamma and Aunt Martha visited the Centennial and\r\ntheir reports of its sights and wonders made me most anxious to go to\r\nPhiladelphia, also. When it was proposed that our return trip should\r\nbe made by way of that city, in order that my father might visit the\r\nexposition I was delighted, but when he arrived and said he could not,\r\non account of the state of his business affairs, I received one of the\r\ngreat disappointments of my life. I shall never forget my unavailing\r\nefforts to persuade them that they ought not to make me miss that\r\nCentennial, since I could not possibly live a hundred years for the\r\nnext one.\r\n\r\nSoon after we left the old home was sold, and grandfather and Aunt\r\nMartha moved to California, where the rest of us lived. The man who\r\nbought the place cut down the beautiful trees, tore down the house and\r\nbuilt two small ones in its stead. But although the original house is\r\ngone in fact it will live in my mind as long as I do. I could draw its\r\nfloor plan; I could set much of its furniture in the correct position.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the dining-room was for years very important for\r\nme, because the only way I could distinguish my right hand from my\r\nleft was by seating myself in imagination beside grandfather at table\r\nwhere I was when I first learned which was which,--left toward him,\r\nright toward cellar door. And, being so seated, I recall another\r\nlesson,--vinegar should not be called beginniger.\r\n\r\nIt was in the south yard that we built the big snow-man; it was there\r\nthat the sleigh upset when we turned in from the street with too much\r\nof a flourish, and pitched Nan and me deep into a snow bank; it was\r\nhere under the apple trees that we turned somersaults; it was here that\r\nthe horse stood on his hind legs to shake down his favorite apples\r\nfrom the tree. The same horse would come to the stone door-step by the\r\nkitchen and rattle the bucket there when he was thirsty; that was the\r\ndoorstep where I placed my feet when papa made my little shoes shine\r\nlike his boots; and here Elizabeth was packed in grandfather Weston’s\r\nold clock-case for her long ride to California,--as if she were going\r\nin a coffin to heaven. But the San Justo heaven lacked the great beds\r\nof lilies-of-the-valley, such as grew under the trees in the Maine yard.\r\n\r\nThese impressions were planted deep in my mind during the months I\r\nspent in the beautiful village, with its dignified white houses, its\r\ntall trees, its great river. But, once again on my westward way, they\r\nslipped back into the files of memory, displaced by the renewal of\r\nother old impressions, for I was making my fourth trans-continental\r\ntrip, my fourth stop in Chicago with my mother’s brother, Josiah\r\nHathaway.\r\n\r\nWhat fun there was, riding a whole long week in a Pullman car with\r\nits many friendly people, and a new routine of life. In those days\r\ndining-cars, with leisurely meals and dainty service had not been\r\ndiscovered. There were irregular stops with only twenty minutes for\r\nrefreshment, so that a child must depend largely on the luncheon\r\nbasket. The bringing of the table and opening the tempting boxes\r\nand packages was a welcome break in the long day. There were tall\r\ngreen bottles of queen olives, and pans packed with fried chicken,\r\nand all the bread and jam one might eat. We had a can of patent\r\nlemonade,--strange greenish sugar, needing only a few drops from the\r\nlittle bottle embedded in the powder, and train water to make it into\r\nambrosia. Such a meal involved soiled hands, but even the washing of\r\nthem had a new charm, for mamma took with her to the dressing-room a\r\nbottle of Murray and Lanman’s Florida Water, a few drops of which in\r\nthe alkali water made a milky bath fit for the hands of a princess.\r\n\r\nWhen interest within the car failed there was the window, with its ever\r\nnew pictures. If there were no houses or people, mountains or clouds to\r\nbe seen, there might be a village of prairie dogs, and the rhythm of\r\npassing poles carrying the telegraph wires never failed. I saw cowboys\r\non their dancing horses, and silent Indians, the women carrying on\r\ntheir backs little Hiawathas, and offering for sale bows and arrows or\r\nbeaded moccasins.\r\n\r\nThen night came, and with it the making of magic beds by the smiling\r\nblack genie. Once, after I had been deposited behind the green\r\ncurtains, we stopped at a way station, where, pressing my nose against\r\nthe window pane, I saw by the light of a torch, a great buffalo head\r\nmounted on a pole, and many men moving in and out of the fitful light.\r\n\r\nWith groans and creakings, with bells and weird whistles we were soon\r\nunder way again, and, to the steady song of the wheel, in the swaying\r\nspringy bed, I was being whisked over the plains in as many days as\r\nfather had once spent in months driving the first sheep to California.\r\n\r\nWe went back to San Justo and stayed there forever; and then,\r\nwhen I was almost seven, we went south to the Cerritos for a\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten summer with my cousin Harry. When fall came,\r\ninstead of returning to the ranch at San Juan we moved to Los Angeles,\r\na little city, and there I lived until both it and I grew up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV FATHER’S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after we settled in Los Angeles I was very sick, due, I fear, to\r\nthe hasty swallowing of half-chewed raisins when my foraging expedition\r\nto the pantry was menaced by an approaching mother. She did not know\r\nfor several hours about my disobedience of her law against “swiping”\r\nfood between meals,--if I were really hungry I would be glad to eat dry\r\nbread without butter or jam,--but the punishment for sin was as sure as\r\nit was in the Sunday school books. I sat for a long, long time screwed\r\nup in a little aching knot in front of the Franklin stove before I was\r\nready to admit an excruciating pain. I think now-a-days it would have\r\nbeen called appendicitis.\r\n\r\nThe doctor took heroic measures: caster oil, tiny black stinking pills,\r\nsteaming flannels wrung out of boiling vinegar and applied to my\r\nshrinking abdomen; awful, thick, nasty, white, sweetish cod-liver-oil.\r\nI survived.\r\n\r\nI was only seven, and not used to staying in bed for a month at a time,\r\nso papa, sorry for me, day by day, told me the story of his life. He\r\ntold me about his home, the brick farm house at Norridgewock on the\r\nKennebec, the same river that I had seen when I was in Maine.\r\n\r\nWhen he was a little boy there were no matches and no kitchen stoves,\r\nso that his mother had to cook before an open fireplace, and the\r\nclothes for all the family were made at home. His mother spun wool from\r\ntheir sheep and wove it into cloth and dyed it in the great indigo pot\r\nthat stood when she was not using it just inside the shed door. When\r\nthey killed a cow for beef they saved the hide, and then in the fall a\r\ntraveling shoemaker came to the house and made boots for them, right\r\nthere where they could watch him.\r\n\r\nWhen papa was six he secretly learned to milk one of the cows and\r\nthen with great joy exhibited his prowess, only to be informed that\r\nthereafter it was to be his daily chore. Another duty that fell to him\r\nabout this time was to take care at night of each two year-old whenever\r\nits place in the cradle was taken by a new baby. Somehow the oldest\r\nchild in the family, Francina, managed to escape the usual fate of an\r\noldest daughter, that of secondary mother.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful hat that papa ever had was made by cutting down a\r\nwhite beaver of his father’s--possibly a “Tippecanoe and Tyler too”\r\ncampaign hat. Once when it was worn on a berrying expedition he hung it\r\non the limb of a tree for safe-keeping--and then could never find the\r\ntree and precious hat again, a tragedy of youth.\r\n\r\nPapa drew an amusing picture of himself at ten years of age in his\r\n“Sunday-go-to-meeting” clothes. His trousers came half way between\r\nknee and ankle, his jacket was short and round, his collar so high he\r\ncould not turn his head, although he could rest his neck during the\r\nlong service by using his ears as hooks over the top of the collar. A\r\nstove-pipe hat completed the outfit.\r\n\r\nDuring those evening stories while I was convalescing I learned many\r\nthings about the boy’s life in the far-away Maine, of his many cousins,\r\nof his schooling, and why he elected astronomy in place of French at\r\nBloomfield Academy; of the years when he taught school or worked on a\r\nfarm and then of his decision to go to California. He told me of the\r\nsea voyage and the stay in Panama, of San Francisco, and of the life\r\nin Volcano, the little mining town; of the return to Maine and of the\r\njourney west across the plains, driving sheep and cattle. He told me\r\nthe story in detail until he reached Salt Lake City, and then one\r\nevening something intervened, I was well again and the absorbing tale\r\nwas postponed and then again and again, never to be taken up.\r\n\r\nThree years later, Uncle Ben, one of the travelers across the plains,\r\ndied; in a few years more father was gone, and I suddenly realized how\r\nlittle I really knew of the venturesome expedition of the young men. So\r\nI wrote to Dr. Flint, the survivor, asking that he tell me something of\r\ntheir pioneer experience. He replied that he had kept diaries on both\r\njourneys and that I was welcome to see them at any time. But before the\r\nopportunity came he too had died, I was in the thick of a very busy\r\nlife, and his letter was forgotten. Twenty years later I found it and\r\nimmediately asked his son to see the journals, but their existence was\r\nnot known. A holiday devoted to a search among old papers was rewarded\r\nby the discovery of the valuable documents.\r\n\r\nAnd so, while I cannot recall all the detail of the charming tale\r\nmy father told me, I am able, because of these records, to give an\r\naccurate report of how the cousins came to California and brought\r\nacross plains, mountains, and deserts to this Pacific Coast some of\r\nthe first American sheep, and thus were instrumental in developing an\r\nindustry that for many years was of great importance.\r\n\r\nIt was May 21, 1851, when Amasa and Llewellyn Bixby and Dr. Thomas\r\nFlint left their Maine homes and followed the trail of the gold\r\nseekers. They sailed from New York on the steamer Crescent City, and\r\nmet the usual conditions of travel at that period. A retelling of\r\nthese facts might become monotonous; the actual experiences of each\r\ntraveler were new, and varied according to the personal equipment and\r\nsensibility.\r\n\r\nAfter a week the young men landed at Chagres. They started up the river\r\non a small stern-wheel steamer, which they occupied for two days and\r\ntwo nights, during the latter tied up to the bank. At Gorgona they\r\ntransferred to a small boat, propelled by the poles of six natives. The\r\nrailroad was in course of construction, but not yet ready for use.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon of the third day and the entire fourth was spent in\r\na leisurely tramp over the mountain trail that led down to the Western\r\nport. This walk they enjoyed greatly, observing the strange tropical\r\nland. Several times during the long day they refreshed themselves by\r\nbathing in the clear mountain pools. When from a high point of land\r\nthey saw the blue Pacific, they felt like Balboa on his peak in Darian.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the S. S. Northerner for San Francisco,--on which\r\nthey had passage engaged--a number of days were spent happily,\r\ncomfortably, and at reasonable expense in the ancient walled city of\r\nPanama.\r\n\r\nThe steamer, when it came, proved a very poor means of transportation,\r\nbeing much over-crowded, dirty, infested with vermin, poorly supplied\r\nwith food and leaking so badly that it was necessary to use the pumps\r\nduring the entire journey. A stop for a day at Acapulco brought a\r\nwelcome change with dinner at a good hotel and an attractive walk into\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThey arrived in San Francisco the sixth of July, but made no stop,\r\ngoing on that afternoon by boat to Sacramento, and from there on to\r\nVolcano Diggings, their objective point. Here they found Benjamin\r\nFlint, a brother of Thomas, who had come out in 1849. Their time from\r\nhome was fifty-three days.\r\n\r\nVolcano was a characteristic mining town, not far from Sutter’s Mill,\r\nMokelumne Hill, Hangtown, and other places familiar to all who have\r\nread of those early California days. It was the point on the overland\r\ntrail to which Kit Carson was accustomed to conduct emigrants, leaving\r\nthem to find their own way from there on to their various destinations.\r\nThe wheel marks of the old wagons may still be seen on the limestone\r\nrocks above the town.\r\n\r\nAfter a few months father’s brothers, Marcellus and Jotham, came around\r\nthe Horn in a sailing vessel, the Samuel Appleton. Uncle Marcellus\r\ncommented in his diary on the monotony of the long trip--“a dull\r\nbusiness going to California on a sail ship.” He spoke of the beauty\r\nof the extreme southern mountains like white marble pyramids, of the\r\nkilling of an albatross with a fourteen-foot wing-spread, of the cape\r\npigeons, “the prettiest birds alive.”\r\n\r\nWith these brothers came two cousins, making the family group in this\r\none little settlement about a dozen.\r\n\r\nThey all of them dabbled more or less in the search for gold, but\r\ngradually turned to agricultural pursuits. Father’s mining days were\r\nlimited to one week, employed in driving a mule for gathering up pay\r\ndirt; that satisfied him. He took a job in the local butcher shop at\r\none hundred and fifty dollars a month, with “keep,” a very important\r\nitem in those days of high living cost. He preferred the sureness of\r\nstated wages to the uncertain promise of gold.\r\n\r\nApparently he and the Flints soon purchased the business and continued\r\nto conduct it as long as they remained in Volcano. They were associated\r\nin some way with Messrs. Baker and Stone, of the Buena Vista Ranch,\r\nvery fertile mountain meadow land upon which heavy crops of barley were\r\ngrown, and cattle were fattened for market.\r\n\r\nAfter a year and a half the three of them, young men between the ages\r\nof twenty-five and thirty, determined to “unite their fortunes for the\r\nundertaking of bringing to California sheep and cattle, more for the\r\ntrip than profit.” Consequently, on Christmas Day, 1852, they left for\r\nhome, making their way out of the mountains over roads so buried in\r\nsnow as to be almost impassable. In Sacramento the river was twelve\r\nmiles wide and the streets so full of water that the hack from hotel to\r\nsteamer was a flat boat pulled by a horse.\r\n\r\nIn San Francisco they investigated possible ways of returning to New\r\nYork. First cabin was three hundred dollars, “and get across Isthmus\r\nfrom Panama at your own expense.” The plan adopted was to go steerage\r\non the S. S. Northerner, the one upon which Dr. Flint and father had\r\ncome, then unseaworthy, but now making her first trip after a thorough\r\noverhauling. The fare to Panama was only fifty dollars, which pleased\r\ntheir thrifty souls, and, as there were few passengers, the third\r\nclass accommodations were very comfortable, a great contrast to their\r\nprevious experience. They sailed January first.\r\n\r\nOne of their problems was the safe transfer of their gold to the mint\r\nat Philadelphia. Express charges were so high they decided to avoid\r\nthis expense by carrying it with them in buckskin jackets especially\r\nmade for that purpose. They soon found the weight, about thirty-five\r\nhundred dollars apiece, too burdensome, so they appropriated a vacant\r\nstate-room, put the treasure between two mattresses and set a guard,\r\none or the other of them remaining in the berth day and night.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the steamer at Panama they packed this gold in a large\r\nchest which contained their blankets and clothing, the extra weight\r\nnot being sufficient, in so large a container, to arouse suspicion,\r\nas would have been the case if they had attempted to carry it in a\r\nvalise, which, Dr. Flint comments, “would have had to be backed with a\r\nrevolver.”\r\n\r\nOn landing they hired a muleteer to carry the precious box while they\r\nfollowed on foot, taking pains to keep the pack train in sight most of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nThey walked as far as Cruces, spending a night on the way. They were\r\nhardly settled comfortably at the Halfway House, when there arrived a\r\nmuch bedraggled party, westward bound, containing women and children,\r\nwhose thin-soled shoes had been little protection on the rough and\r\nmuddy trail. I venture a comment that the granddaughters of these women\r\nwith light shoes would have been prepared for the exigencies of such\r\na trip with knickers and hiking boots. Those were days of gallantry,\r\nso our young men surrendered their place of shelter, and moved on in\r\nthe rain to a distant shack, where, at first, there seemed no prospect\r\nof food; later, when the owner of the cabin came in, their recently\r\nacquired ability to speak Spanish stood them in good stead, and they\r\neach were favored with a cup of hot stew.\r\n\r\nFrom Cruces they took a small boat down the Chagres River to Barbacoa,\r\nto which point the railroad had been completed. Here there was some\r\ndelay incident to the refusal of a negro to accompany his master\r\nfurther on the return way to Virginia. He had discovered that by\r\nstaying on the Isthmus he would escape the slavery that was his. An\r\nattempt was made to take him by force from the garret in which he had\r\ntaken refuge, but was given up when the storming party, as they went up\r\nthe rickety stairs of the old building, were met by the very deterring\r\nmuzzles of big-bore Mexican rifles. The sympathy of the young Maine\r\nmen was, naturally, with the negro. The diary comments that it was a\r\nfrequent custom for Southerners to take slaves with them to do the\r\nactual work in the California gold fields.\r\n\r\nAt Aspinwall passage on an independent steamer was found for\r\ntwenty-five dollars, making the total fare from San Francisco but\r\nseventy-five dollars, as contrasted with three hundred dollars, the\r\nfirst cabin rate.\r\n\r\nThey stopped at Kingston, Jamaica, for coal. “Llewell stayed by\r\nour deposits” while the others went ashore, just as he had done at\r\nAspinwall. I am interested to learn from these early entries that the\r\ncapacity for “staying by” in times of stress was as characteristic of\r\nfather in his young days as it was in later years when I knew him.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven days out from San Francisco they reached New York, and,\r\ntaking their gold in a valise, set out at once for Philadelphia. They\r\narrived at night and went to the Hotel Washington, where they took\r\na room together in order to protect the valuable satchel. The next\r\nmorning it was safe in the mint, where everything was assayed, fifty\r\ndollar slugs, coins from private mints of San Francisco, and native\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nOf the experience in Philadelphia, Dr. Flint writes: “January 29:\r\nGot our mint receipts of the value of our deposits. We were dressed a\r\nlittle rough when we arrived, and at the hotel were seated at the most\r\ninconvenient table. But as we dressed up somewhat and the report of our\r\ngold got more known we were moved pretty well up in the dining room\r\nbefore we left.”\r\n\r\nThe next day they went on to Boston where they stopped at the United\r\nStates Hotel, a hotel to which my father took me nearly forty years\r\nlater, when he escorted me east to enter Wellesley College.\r\n\r\nThe evening of February first they reached their home, just a month\r\nfrom San Francisco. The journey west two years before had taken nearly\r\ntwice as long.\r\n\r\nSince they were among the first to return from the gold fields, they\r\nwere objects of great interest to all the neighbors round about. They\r\nhad scores of visitors, all eager for news of their own men-folk in\r\nfar away California, the land so vaguely known, its great distances so\r\nunder-estimated. They assumed that the returned travelers might know\r\neveryone in the new state.\r\n\r\nThey visited at home for five weeks. “We talked,” says Dr. Flint,\r\n“until our vocal chords could stand the strain no longer and were glad\r\nto start west.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V DRIVING SHEEP ACROSS THE PLAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 8, 1852, the cousins began the long return journey by rail,\r\nhorseback, emigrant wagon and foot that ended just ten months later\r\nat San Gabriel, in Southern California. Dr. Flint, at the end of his\r\ndiary, sums up the distances as follows:\r\n\r\n“Today closes the year 1853, and one year from the time we left San\r\nFrancisco on the steamship Northerner; in which time we have traveled\r\nby steamship 5,344 miles. By railroad 2,144 miles. I have, by steamboat\r\non Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, 1,074 miles. On horseback and on\r\nfoot 2,131 miles, making a total of 10,693 on a direct line between\r\npoints reached.”\r\n\r\nThis diary is said to have especial historical value because the author\r\nput down daily specific facts of cost, distance and conditions of\r\ntravel. Many accounts of the overland trip are but memories.\r\n\r\nAs I have read the journal I have been impressed with the idea that\r\nwhile it took vision, health and character on the part of the young\r\npioneers to accomplish their object, the burdens came only day by day\r\nand would not be refused by the vigorous young grandsons whom I know\r\nnow, were the same rewards offered for enterprise and endurance.\r\n\r\nThe railroad journey from Boston to Terre Haute, the western terminus\r\nof the road, was a very different one from that of today, taking then a\r\nweek instead of a few hours.\r\n\r\nThey went down from Anson and Norridgewock to Boston where they\r\nexchanged their “money at Suffolk Bank for their bills, as they were\r\ngood anywhere West, and none others were.”\r\n\r\nLeaving Boston at 8 A.M., an all day ride took them to Albany, where\r\nthey spent the night at the Delavan House. They went on early the\r\nnext morning to Buffalo, which was reached at 11 P.M. Here they “put\r\nup at the Clarendon House. Tired. Sleepy.” At eleven in the forenoon\r\nthey left for Cincinnati, reaching Cleveland at 8 P.M., Columbus at 4\r\nA.M., where they changed cars, and arrived at their destination late\r\nat night, after a thirty-six hour ride in day coaches. They rested at\r\nCincinnati until the next afternoon, when they went over to Dayton\r\nfor the purpose of making an early start on the last lap of the\r\nrailroading. The entry for March 16 reads:\r\n\r\n“Called at 2 o’clock A.M., went aboard cars at 2-1/2. No breakfast,\r\nnor could we get a mouthful until we arrived in Indianapolis, at 2-1/2\r\no’clock P.M. The R. R. was new, rough and no stations by the way.\r\nArrived in Terre Haute about 5 P.M.”\r\n\r\nHere they stopped for a week at the Prairie House. They organized their\r\nfirm of Flint, Bixby & Co., in which Benjamin, who had been longer in\r\nCalifornia, had four parts to three each for the others. They wrote\r\nletters, bought three horses, fitted saddles to them, and, on March\r\n19th, started west for Paris, Illinois, over “roads as bad as mud can\r\nmake them.”\r\n\r\nThey went across the state, a few miles a day, calling occasionally on\r\nan old friend or on one of their many cousins who had settled in the\r\nMiddle West. Once they stopped over night in Urbana at the Middlesex\r\nHouse, where they found six beds in a 6 x 9 room, and had for breakfast\r\n“fried eggs swimming in lard, the almost universal food in this part of\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\nBy April first they had arrived in Quincy. “Had a hard time finding the\r\ntown,” says Dr. Flint. “Most of the way through oak-wooded prairie,\r\nuncultivated.... Horseback distance from Terre Haute, 348 miles.”\r\n\r\nQuincy was their headquarters while they were seeking and buying sheep,\r\nfinding a few at one place, a few at another. Father once told me of\r\nthe vexations they had at first, trying to drive in one homogeneous\r\nband all these little groups of sheep, each with its own bell wether.\r\n\r\nDuring the last of April and the first of May, while still buying\r\nstock, they sheared their sheep at Warsaw, Illinois, selling the wool,\r\n6,410 pounds, for $1,570.45 to Connable-Smith Co., of Keokuk, Iowa. At\r\nthis time it is recorded that father received a remittance of $1,000.00\r\nfrom a California acquaintance, undoubtedly a welcome addition to their\r\nfunds with such an undertaking ahead of them. They must have had their\r\ntrip well planned before they left Volcano, for Pacific Coast mail to\r\nmeet them thus.\r\n\r\nOn May 7 they started off for the overland journey with 1,880 sheep,\r\nyoung and old, eleven yoke of oxen, two cows, four horses, two wagons,\r\ncomplete camping outfit; four men, three dogs, and themselves. They\r\nferried across the Mississippi River at Keokuk for $62.00.\r\n\r\nAt some time during the trip the number of sheep was increased for I\r\nhave always heard it said that the flock contained 2,400, and I have a\r\nlater brief resume of the trip, made by Dr. Flint, in which he mentions\r\nthe larger number.\r\n\r\nThere was much travel across the plains at this time. The entry for May\r\n8 is: “In Keokuk. Visited the Mormon camp where it was said there were\r\n3,400 proselytes from Europe, 278 emigrant wagons ready to convey them\r\nto Salt-Lake. A motley crowd of English, Welsh, Danes, etc.”\r\n\r\nFather and Ben went on across Iowa with their train, while Dr. Flint\r\nwent alone by steamer to St. Louis to purchase further supplies, which\r\nhe took up the Missouri on the S. S. El Paso to meet his partners at\r\nCouncil Bluffs.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that while he was in St. Louis he heard Prof.\r\nAgassiz lecture on geology. St. Louis was a far Cry from Cambridge, but\r\nin this golden age of American lectures men took long and hard trips to\r\ncarry knowledge to eager learners. How fortunate that Mr. Bryan had not\r\nyet arisen to combat the spread of scientific thinking!\r\n\r\nThe trip up the river from St. Louis to Council Bluffs took ten\r\ndays, due in part to the many stops for loading and unloading, and\r\nto the necessity for tying up at night because of changing currents\r\nand shifting banks. There is mention of frontier settlements, of\r\nIndians along shore and of the varied passengers, among them a group\r\nof fourteen Baptist ministers, going to attend a convention. Their\r\npresence brought about the curious anomaly of “prayer meeting at one\r\nend of the saloon, cards at the other.” By Sunday, the 29th, the\r\npreachers had disembarked, and the steamer was “getting above moral and\r\nreligious influences as we leave civilization behind and touch the wild\r\nand woolly west.”\r\n\r\nThe steamer arrived at Kanesville (Council Bluffs) on May 30, where\r\nthe supplies were landed during a severe storm. The place was a “town\r\nof huts, and full of sharp dealers who live off the emigrants ... the\r\noutpost of the white man.”\r\n\r\nHere Dr. Flint met Ben and Lewell with their sheep and wagons, but the\r\ncrossing of the river was delayed for a week by the heavy rains.\r\n\r\nAfter a final gathering of supplies, the purchase of an additional\r\nsaddle horse and another wagon, the stock was ferried across the\r\nMissouri River and they found themselves “fairly on the plains.”\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the party varied from time to time. Dr. Flint says\r\nthere were fifteen men, but does not name them all. Three men, after a\r\ncouple of weeks, became faint-hearted and turned back. The teamsters,\r\nJennings, who served also as butcher, White, the carpenter, and John\r\nTrost, the “Dutchman,” appear to have made the entire trip with them.\r\n\r\nThere is frequent mention of William C. Johnson, who, with his bride\r\nMary, left the party with whom they had been traveling and added their\r\nwagon to ours. Mrs. Johnson, the only woman in the train, contributed\r\nto the general comfort by baking bread for them all, and on gala days\r\nmaking apple pie or doughnuts.\r\n\r\nThis comparatively small group of men and wagons, with much stock, made\r\nconditions somewhat different from those recently pictured in the “The\r\nCovered Wagon,” and yet this film has made real to many the hazards and\r\nfatigue, the courage and the heartbreak, the manner of life and travel\r\nthat were common to all who crossed the plains.\r\n\r\nThe route chosen by my people differed from that picture in that it lay\r\naltogether north of the Platte River, but they encountered many lesser\r\nstreams across which their stock must swim.\r\n\r\nFrom the first of June until the middle of July they were on the\r\nprairies; from then on they were in the Rocky Mountains until the first\r\nof September, when they came down into the Valley of the Great Salt\r\nLake. By the first of October they were well under way again, following\r\nthe Fremont Trail to San Bernardino, a journey of three months. I have\r\ngiven a brief report of their route; the diary is full of interesting\r\ndetails of daily happenings, of the type of country through which they\r\npassed, of the things that grew by the wayside and of the various\r\nanimals they encountered. Comments on the landscape give a hint of the\r\nlove of beauty in the writer, but, being a New Englander, he does not\r\nindulge in much emotional or florid language.\r\n\r\nI was interested in several mentions of the guidebook, Horne’s, which\r\nevidently mapped out the routes with more or less detail. Sometimes\r\nthey found the statements accurate, sometimes not.\r\n\r\nThe sending of a letter home from time to time makes one realize that\r\nthe trail, though long and hard, was a traveled one, and that they were\r\nnot entirely isolated. Occasionally they were overtaken and passed by\r\nthose who could go more rapidly, unhampered by the slow-moving sheep.\r\nFather often said that he walked across the continent; he had a saddle\r\nhorse, Nig, but, going at a sheep’s pace, he found it pleasanter on\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nWhen they first started out from Council Bluffs they met reports that\r\nIndians ahead were troublesome, but they did not encounter any for\r\nnearly a month. Then one day a couple of Omahas, carrying an English\r\nrifle, were in camp for a time. Two nights later the man on guard,\r\nJames Force, was shot dead by an Indian who was attempting to capture\r\nDr. Flint’s horse. Father told me it was his watch, but this man had\r\ntaken it that fatal night, in return for some favor father had shown\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe last of July they had a second meeting with Indians, but\r\nfortunately without casualties on either side. Dr. Flint says: “Soon\r\nafter halting, an half dozen Indians bounded out of the brush and\r\ncommenced to pillage the wagons. The teamsters, Johnson, Palmer, and\r\nJennings, were scared out of their wits and offered no resistance,\r\nbut Mrs. Johnson went after their hands with a hatchet when they went\r\nto help themselves to things in her wagon.... Two more Indians joined\r\nthose already present,--one of them with a certificate that they were\r\nGood Indians. It was written in faultless penmanship, expressing the\r\nhope we would treat them well, so we gave them some hard tack and a\r\nsheep that was lame.... The Indians were greatly astonished when they\r\nfound that we could use the Spanish language. We found that they were a\r\nhunting and marauding party of Arapahoes from Texas.”\r\n\r\nShortly after this our party overtook a desolate train of\r\nMormons,--mostly women and children from England,--who had been robbed\r\nof all their provisions by these “Good Indians,” and who would have\r\nperished but for the timely arrival of our people, who supplied them\r\nwith sufficient food to carry them through to their destination.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of August the company crossed South Pass and “drank from\r\nPacific Springs.” They went past Fort Bridger, where they left the\r\nOregon Trail and turned southward through the mountains into Utah. As\r\nthey were going down the last defiles into the broad valley they were\r\nmet by watchers who enquired if they were saints or sinners. When it\r\nwas known that they were the people who were the saviors of the robbed\r\nand stranded Mormons, they were given a royal welcome by Brigham Young\r\nand his saints. Their flocks were turned into the Church pastures, and\r\nthey were given free access to the gardens. After long months of camp\r\nfare they enjoyed greatly the plenty of this promised land, the green\r\ncorn, squashes, potatoes and melons.\r\n\r\nIt had been their intent to drive their stock directly across Nevada\r\nand the Sierras into Central California, their destination, but the\r\nseason was so late they feared the heavy snows that were imminent in\r\nthe high mountains. They therefore determined to travel southwest into\r\nSouthern California and from there to drive up the coast.\r\n\r\nAfter about three weeks of rest and recuperation, they set out, with\r\nflocks augmented by purchase from the Mormons, upon the hardest portion\r\nof the trail.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on there is frequent mention of other parties engaged\r\nin similar enterprise. A number of these joined forces for mutual\r\nprotection against the Indians, who were very troublesome in the\r\nSouthwest. They attempted to stampede the horses and cattle, which were\r\neasily frightened. The sheep were not so hard to protect, for they when\r\nalarmed huddled closer to the camp fire.\r\n\r\nAlthough the men were constantly annoyed by the attempts of the Indians\r\nto run off stock, they managed to avoid actual conflict and no lives\r\nwere lost.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians did succeed in cutting out some of the stock they\r\nwould return it, on being paid at the rate of two “hickory” shirts\r\n(the khaki of that day) for a cow, and one for a calf. On one occasion\r\nthe Indians brought in venison for sale, which was bought and eaten,\r\nbefore it was discovered that the number of “deer” corresponded exactly\r\nwith the number of colts that were missing.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has made the rail trip between Salt Lake City and Los\r\nAngeles can appreciate the references made in the diary to the rough\r\nand stony trails, the dust, the days without water or food for the\r\nanimals, to sage-brush and cactus, and can but wonder how it was\r\npossible to get flocks across the desert country at all.\r\n\r\nOn the earlier part of this trail, where there was still some\r\nnoticeable vegetation, they lost many sheep through the eating of\r\npoison weeds. They lost others through the drinking of poor water or\r\nthe entire lack of it for many weary miles.\r\n\r\nAt one place they had trouble with quicksands, at another the sheep\r\nbalked at crossing the Rio Virgin and father and two helpers spent a\r\nwhole afternoon packing on their backs one sheep at a time across a\r\nhundred-foot ford.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of December, the Flint-Bixby train and the Hollister\r\ntrain started together on the hardest portion of the whole trip--about\r\na hundred miles without water, except for the meager Bitter Water\r\nSprings. Most of the wagons and the cattle went on ahead, and, after\r\nthree days, reached the springs, where they waited for the other men\r\nwith the sheep. On the fourth day the first of the Hollister sheep\r\ncame in; on the fifth, in the morning, came Ben and father, and in\r\nthe afternoon Hub Hollister. Dr. Flint mentions the oxen as being\r\n“famished for want of food and particularly for water, a sad sight\r\nof brute suffering.” With the arrival of the sheep, the cattle again\r\nwent on to the Mojave River. The sheep did not arrive until the\r\nfourteenth, after eleven days spent in crossing the desert. The diary\r\ntells something of the trouble experienced. Dr. Flint says: “I packed\r\nmy horse with provisions and started back to meet Ben and Lewell with\r\nthe sheep. Met them some six miles out. They had used up all their\r\nwater and food, hence it was a relief to them when I hove in sight.\r\nSome of the men had such a dread of the desert that they were beside\r\nthemselves, imagining they would parish from thirst before getting over\r\nthe forty miles.” It appears from this that the prime movers in the\r\nenterprise must not only be brave and fearless themselves, but must\r\nalso provide courage for their helpers.\r\n\r\nIt was this stretch of desert that caused the greatest loss to men who\r\nimported sheep in this manner. Just how many of ours died, or had to\r\nbe abandoned, I have never heard, but my father told me that they were\r\nfortunate in losing fewer than the average.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching the Mojave River they all rested for several days, “the\r\nmen loafing about the camps or pitching horse shoes.” Evidently this\r\nfavorite masculine sport did not defer its entry into California until\r\nthe arrival of the Iowa contingent.\r\n\r\nConditions at last were better. They camped on dry burr clover instead\r\nof sand and stones and “had a big fire of cottonwood, which gave a\r\ncosy look to the camp.” They had a stew of wild ducks and got “a mess\r\nof quail for Christmas dinner on the morrow.”\r\n\r\nOn the 29th they “moved on towards the summit of the Sierras. Warm and\r\npleasant. Green grass in places two inches high. Snow clad mountains on\r\nour right.”\r\n\r\nOn Friday the 30th they crossed the mountains through Cajon Pass, and\r\non New Years Day, the scribe to whom we are indebted for the detailed\r\naccount of this long, long journey was the guest of the Hollisters\r\nat San Bernardino for dinner. Father told me they celebrated by\r\nhaving doughnuts. It is evident that the two trains came in together,\r\nsometimes one ahead, sometimes the other. I make note of the fact of\r\ntheir traveling in company because I have seen it stated in print that\r\nCol. Hollister was the first to bring American sheep to California. I\r\nam pleased to be able to offer this contemporary witness to the fact\r\nthat there are others to share the honor. Mention is made of the sheep\r\nof Frazer, White and Viles, and McClanahan as well as of Col. Hollister\r\nand Flint, Bixby & Co., all of whom shared the hardships of the trail\r\nthose last days of 1853.\r\n\r\nThe San Bernardino into which they came after their long trip across\r\nthe desert was a Mormon colony which had been founded three years\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nAfter spending the New Year at San Bernardino the herds that we have\r\nfollowed across the plains moved on to the “Coco Mongo” ranch and\r\nvineyard.\r\n\r\nThis was apparently a current spelling as it occurs in official\r\ngovernment documents. It is a word of Indian origin meaning a sandy\r\nplace. The first grape vines which still surprise the passer-by with\r\ntheir growth in seemingly pure sand had been planted some ten years\r\nbefore this. The old winery stands just north of the Foothill Boulevard\r\nbetween Upland and Cucamonga.\r\n\r\nThe next drive took the men and sheep across the valley to the Williams\r\nRanch, the Santa Ana del Chino, and after a night there they moved on\r\nto San Gabriel, which they reached the evening of January seventh.\r\nThe entry of the journal for January ninth would indicate that new\r\ncomers seventy years ago were as impressed by orange trees, as are the\r\ntourists of today:--“A beautiful scene at sunrise. There had been a\r\nlight flurry of snow during the night which stuck to the orange leaves\r\nand to the fruit, which, when lighted by the clear morning sun made a\r\nmost beautiful contrast of colors tropical and arctic.”\r\n\r\nOn that date they moved over to the ranges of the Rancho San Pasqual\r\nwhere they had been able to rent pasturage. This is the site of the\r\npresent city of Pasadena. Here they camped for the remainder of the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n“The only incident out of the ordinary routine of camp life for two\r\nmonths,” says Dr. Flint, “was the birth of a son to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJohnson.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring they moved northward, through Ventura and Santa Barbara;\r\nthence through the mountains to Paso Robles and San Luis Obispo, again\r\nover the high hills and onward until they came to San Jose, where they\r\nrented the Rancho Santa Teresa and pastured their sheep for fourteen\r\nmonths. They sheared and sold their wool to Moore and Folger, familiar\r\nnames in those old days. They sold wethers for mutton at $16 a head and\r\nbought a thousand sheep at $5.00. Then in the summer of 1855 they moved\r\nto Monterey county in search of feed, and, in October, bought from\r\nFrancisco Perez Pacheco the Rancho San Justo, half of which they soon\r\nsold to their friend Col. Hollister. It is on this latter portion that\r\nthe city of Hollister now stands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RANCHO SAN JUSTO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI RANCHO SAN JUSTO\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the purchase of the first land, the Rancho San Justo, Flint, Bixby\r\n& Co., were definitely located, and for forty years San Juan Bautista\r\nwas their headquarters. After father’s death the firm was dissolved and\r\nthe properties separated, the Flints retaining the lands in the north\r\nand the Bixby heirs those in Southern California.\r\n\r\nAs time went on the flocks increased beyond the capacity of the\r\noriginal ranch to support them, and since the wool business was\r\nprofitable, other land was bought. As a little girl at San Justo I used\r\nto hear my father tell of necessary trips over to the “Worry-Worry”\r\nranch. In later years I discovered that he was speaking of the\r\nHuero-Huero. Another of the ranches in Central California was the San\r\nJoaquin.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the firm bought in Los Angeles county the Ranchos Los Cerritos,\r\nand a little later took a part interest in the adjoining Los Alamitos.\r\nThey held a half interest in the western part of the Palos Verdes,\r\nthe seventeen thousand acres, which since its sale has figured so\r\nprominently in real estate literature. Flint, Bixby & Co. were also\r\nhalf owners of the great San Joaquin Ranch in Orange Co. with James\r\nIrvine, to whom they sold their interest in the late seventies. They\r\nowned these great tracts of land when there were so few people in\r\nSouthern California, that it was possible to utilize them for grazing\r\npurposes. When settlers came in the lands were sold in comparatively\r\nlarge parcels to men who had sufficient capital to subdivide and retail\r\nthem as small farms or town lots.\r\n\r\nFlint, Bixby & Co. were primarily stock raisers, but they branched out\r\ninto a number of other lines.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1869 they operated the Coast Line Stage Co., which carried\r\npassengers, Wells Fargo express and mails between San Francisco, Los\r\nAngeles and San Diego, until 1877, when the Southern Pacific completed\r\na line between the first two cities. The stage time between San\r\nFrancisco and Los Angeles was sixty-six hours.\r\n\r\nThe making of beet sugar interested them and they, with others,\r\norganized and built at Alvarado, Alameda Co., the first successful\r\nsugar factory not only in California but in the United States. The\r\ninitial run was in 1870. Flint, Bixby & Co. transferred their interest\r\nto a second factory in Soquel, Santa Cruz Co. This new industry\r\nsuffered from drought, insect pests, price cutting by competing cane\r\nsugar interests and the fact that at that time the process of making\r\nsugar from beets had not been developed to the point it now is, and\r\nthe product was not popular. In 1880 the Soquel factory was closed.\r\nFather, however, retained a belief in the ultimate practicability of\r\nsugar-making in California, and his last business undertaking was an\r\nattempt to re-establish it on the Cerritos, near Long Beach. It was\r\nin 1896, the year of the free-silver agitation, and he was unable to\r\nfinance a sugar factory himself, but he induced the Clark interests to\r\nput one up on adjoining territory at Los Alamitos, thus obtaining a\r\nmarket for future beet crops.\r\n\r\nIt is hard now-a-days to visualize conditions in California during\r\nthe fifties outside of San Francisco or the mining camps. The vast\r\nstretches of open valley and hill land were practically uninhabited,\r\nand were infested with wild beasts, and sometimes, wilder men. A very\r\nvivid impression of this may be obtained by anyone fortunate enough to\r\nread an account of “A Dangerous Journey From San Francisco to San Luis\r\nObispo” given by J. Ross Browne in his book called _Crusoe’s Island_.\r\nWe spent one of his nights in the old inn at San Juan, where the young\r\nMaine stockmen were so soon to settle.\r\n\r\nThe venture of bringing the sheep across the plains having proved good\r\nand a wide estate having been acquired the young men turned their\r\nthoughts to home-building, which is in a primary way, state building.\r\nNot content with the women the west at that time afforded, each in his\r\nturn, like Jacob of old, made a pilgrimage back to the land from which\r\nhe came in search of a wife of his own people; but, unlike the old\r\npatriarch, it did not take long to find the bride willing to return to\r\nthat far-off, glamorous California. Benjamin Flint’s wife was Caroline\r\nGetchell and Dr. Flint’s was Mary Mitchell, both girls from their home\r\ntown of Anson. Father married Sarah Hathaway of Bloomfield, now a part\r\nof Skowhegan.\r\n\r\nThe way of it was this. Soon after his return to Norridgewock, he,\r\nwith many others, was a guest at the annual church party at the home\r\nof Mr. Hathaway, the minister of the parish at Bloomfield. He had been\r\ntold that he would find “a passel” of pretty girls there, and was\r\nadvised that Margaret, the second, was especially beautiful. That was\r\na fateful party! Out of it came the destiny of all the five daughters,\r\nfor four of them married Bixbys and the fifth became foster mother to\r\nthree of us children.\r\n\r\nIt was not the recommended, witty, black-eyed Margaret, however, who\r\nwon the love of Llewellyn, but the oldest girl, tall, blue-eyed Sarah,\r\nwhose name I bear. She captured his heart, and soon left Maine to go\r\nwith him the long way, by Panama, to the distant ranch of San Juan.\r\n\r\nWhat more natural than when, after a time, brother Jotham returned to\r\nhis home, he should go over to the neighboring parsonage to bear the\r\ngreetings of his sister-in-law, Sarah, to her family? It is told that,\r\nwhen upon this errand he met at the gate the lovely Margaret, he lost\r\nhis heart completely. He never regained it. When he was eighty he told\r\nme emphatically that his wife not only had been the most beautiful\r\nwoman in California, but that she still was.\r\n\r\nA few months after this meeting Margaret traveled with friends across\r\nthe Isthmus, and up the coast to San Francisco, there to be met by\r\nher sister and taken to San Justo to await her marriage day, which\r\ncame shortly. She was married in her new home in old San Juan by the\r\nminister, Dr. Edwards, who had recently been a missionary among the\r\nChoctaw Indians. A letter describing the ceremony tells of the usual\r\npreparations, the making of bride’s cake and wedding cake, of putting\r\nthe finishing touches on the little house, of the arranging of the\r\nwedding veil and the gathering in the early evening of the group of\r\nfriends and relatives, including three little folks that had already\r\ncome into the different families.\r\n\r\nThe home began immediately, and a few days later a call at the house\r\ndiscovered the bride happy in her house work and doing the first family\r\nwashing.\r\n\r\nThis wedding ceremony was the first that Dr. Edwards had ever performed\r\nfor white people, but it is reported to have been so well done that no\r\none would have guessed inexperience. It is to be hoped that his later\r\nservices in this line were as successful as this one. He was still the\r\nminister in San Juan when I was a child and he was wont to entertain me\r\nby repeating the Lord’s prayer in Choctaw.\r\n\r\nThe same letter which reports the marriage speaks of the new ranch\r\nhouse that was building and of the hope that it would be ready for\r\noccupancy in about two months, which dates the building for me,--early\r\nin 1863.\r\n\r\nEach of the cousins when he married had brought his wife back to the\r\nSan Justo, where they occupied in common a comparatively small house,\r\nwhich in my childhood was used for the hired men. But children were\r\ncoming and a larger home was necessary. The men were intimate and\r\ncongenial, and dreamed of an enlargement and continuation of their\r\nassociated lives; the income was ample so they proceeded to build them\r\na great house, a communal house, a staunch Maine house, white-painted\r\nand green-shuttered, as solid and true today as sixty years ago,--but,\r\nalas, now idle. This was the house in which I was born.\r\n\r\nThey planted the garden about it and the orchard, and made below it the\r\npond where the hills could look to see if their trees were on straight.\r\nIn winter time those hills were as green as any of Maine in June, but\r\nin our rainless summer they were soft tan or gold against the cobalt\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate three families there were three apartments, each\r\nwith sitting-room, bedroom and bath, and in addition, for the use\r\nof the whole group, a common parlor, large office, dining room and\r\nkitchen, together with numerous guest rooms in the upper story.\r\nEvery convenience of the period was included,--ample closets, modern\r\nplumbing, sufficient fire-places.\r\n\r\nThe plan for housekeeping in this large establishment was for each\r\nwife in turn to take charge for a month. It was no small undertaking\r\nto provide for the household, with the growing flocks of children and\r\nthe frequent addition of visiting sisters, cousins, or aunts. The\r\nwomen involved, being individuals, had differing capacities and ideas,\r\nand each had the desire for a home managed according to her own idea.\r\nImagine sitting down to every meal with six parents, twelve children\r\nand half a dozen guests! Inevitably the communal plan could not but\r\nfail to be altogether ideal. For a wonder it held together in a fashion\r\nfor fifteen years, but there were many trips to San Francisco to\r\nrelieve the strain, or long visits of mothers and children in Maine,\r\nthat I guess might not have been so frequent or of so long duration if\r\nthere had been individual homes for the cousin-partners. Ultimately the\r\nBen Flints took up a permanent residence in Oakland and we moved to Los\r\nAngeles, leaving the Dr. Flints on the ranch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII LOS ALAMITOS AND LOS CERRITOS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many reasons our choice of Los Angeles as a residence was a very\r\nhappy one. In the first place it gave my father an opportunity to keep\r\nin touch with his business interests in the southern part of the state,\r\nand in the second it fulfilled two dear wishes of my mother.\r\n\r\nIt had been her desire, for years, to get away from the large ranch\r\nhouse at San Justo, with its crowds of people, and into a small home\r\nof her own where she could surround her children with influences and\r\nconditions that accorded with her ideals.\r\n\r\nAgain, it was joy to her to be near her two sisters, who lived on the\r\nneighboring ranches, Los Cerritos and Los Alamitos, and to her father\r\nwho had recently come to Southern California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RANCHO LOS ALAMITOS]\r\n\r\nThe three families were doubly related,--Hathaway mothers and Bixby\r\nfathers, Mary and Llewellyn, Margaret and Jotham, Susan and John. I\r\nhave told of my father’s marriage to Sarah Hathaway. She was always\r\na delicate girl and lived only six years after she came west as a\r\nbride. There were no children, much to the disappointment of them both.\r\nAfter an interval of six years father returned to Maine and married my\r\nmother, Mary, the little sister of his loved Sarah, who had, in the\r\ntwelve years passed, grown to womanhood. When I came I was given the\r\nname of this beloved older sister and wife.\r\n\r\nBefore this time Jotham Bixby and his family had moved from San Juan\r\nto the Cerritos ranch, bringing with them for company at the isolated\r\nhome, his wife’s sister, Susan, who, in the course of time married\r\nthe young cousin, John W. Bixby, newly come from Maine. They fell in\r\nlove and became engaged and kept their secret right under the noses\r\nof interested friends and relatives who were planning all sorts of\r\nmatrimonial alliances except the one that was planning itself--one\r\ndestined to exceptional happiness.\r\n\r\nWhen they married they left the Cerritos and lived in Wilmington, where\r\nthey remained for several years. They moved their home to the Alamitos\r\nabout the time that we came south to settle in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe intimate connection of double blood-kinship and of business\r\nassociation made the three families seem like one and us children like\r\nbrothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nOur home in Los Angeles became the headquarters for the out-of-town\r\nrelatives, and several times a week we had some of them for luncheon\r\nguests. On the other hand we of the town grasped every chance to spend\r\na day, a week, or the long summer vacation at one of the adobes. All\r\nthe festival days were shared. Cerritos claimed the Fourth of July\r\nmost often, for its bare court yard offered a spot free from fire\r\nhazard. What a satisfying supply of fire-works our combined resources\r\noffered! There were torpedoes, safe for babies, fire-crackers of\r\nall sizes, double-headed Dutchmen, Chinese bombs,--to make the day\r\nglorious,--and, for the exciting evening (one of the two yearly\r\noccasions when I was permitted to stay up beyond bed-time) there were\r\npinwheels that flung out beauty from the top of the hitching post,\r\nthere were dozens of roman candles with their streams of enveloping\r\nfire, and luscious shooting stars, and sky-rockets that rose\r\nmajestically with a disdainful shriek as they spurned the earth and\r\ntook a golden road to the sky.\r\n\r\nInter-family feasting at the three homes in turn marked Thanksgiving,\r\nChristmas and New Years Day. It was the laden tree on Christmas Eve\r\nthat offered the second annual escape from early bed-time rules, in\r\nitself enough to key one up to ecstacy, without the added intense joy\r\nof mysterious expectation and satisfied possession of the largesse\r\nof Santa Claus. A Christmas celebration at Cerritos when I was four\r\nstands out distinctly in my memory,--a tall, tall tree, as much as\r\ntwenty feet high, judged by present standards, stood in the upper\r\nchamber whose ceiling, unlifted by an excited imagination, is about\r\neight feet. From that tree came Isabel, my most beloved doll, a small\r\nbottle of Hoyt’s German Cologne,--how I delighted in perfume,--a small\r\niron stove. The latter was put to a use not contemplated by the patron\r\nsaint, for I am sure he did not want me to spend the whole of the\r\nfollowing morning in duress vile in my bed, because of that stove. This\r\nis what happened. After breakfast my almost-twin cousin Harry and I,\r\nwhile our mothers chatted at table, re-visited the scene of the past\r\nevening’s festivities and wished to bring back some of the joy of it.\r\nDrawn curtains gave semi-darkness, candles stolen from the closet under\r\nthe stairs and placed lighted in the wide window-sills gave a subdued\r\nlight, and many little stubs of the gay Christmas tapers from the tree\r\nmade a wonderful illumination under the bed and in the tent made by the\r\nturned-back bed clothes.\r\n\r\nBut it was the escaping fire from the paper-stuffed toy stove which\r\nstood on the sheet about the foot of the tree that made us decide to\r\nhear the clamoring for admittance of the suspicious mothers,--we had\r\nsense enough to summon help when conditions arose with which we were\r\nunable to cope. But Harry was cannier than I, for he sent me to open\r\nthe door where the worried women stood, while he escaped from the far\r\nend, going down a ladder from the flat roof of the wing to the tall\r\nweeds beyond the huge wood-pile. I was apprehended and punished. He\r\nwasn’t, not being subject to the same administration of discipline as\r\nwas I. Then it was that I learned that justice does not always prevail\r\nin this world.\r\n\r\nThis Christmas visit affords my earliest memories of Cerritos, although\r\nI know I had been there several times before. It was the long blissful\r\nsummer when I was seven that packed my mind with vivid pictures and\r\nremembrance of joyful activity. Is not seven a peak in childhood,--old\r\nenough for self direction, young enough for thrills?\r\n\r\nAfter this visit was over and we departed for nearby Los Angeles to\r\nmake ourselves a new home my life went on in parallel lines, school\r\ndays in town, vacation days at the ranches. I should tell of them both\r\nat the same time to be truly realistic, but the exigencies of narration\r\nmake it seem better to write of the two experiences as if they were\r\nseparate. So first, the ranches.\r\n\r\nI have told at length of my birthplace, the San Justo. Although it,\r\nas well as the southern ranches, was devoted to sheep raising, there\r\nwere many differences between them. The houses and gardens at San Justo\r\nwere of New England type, built and developed according to the early\r\nassociations of the young men. At the other ranches the homes were of\r\nadobe, old ones, handed down from an earlier period.\r\n\r\nThe locations and surrounding country also differed greatly. In the\r\nnorth the house stood in a valley between wooded hills, with no wide\r\noutlook. The southern houses were each placed on the brow of a mesa,\r\nwith a view across a characteristic California river which might be a\r\ndangerous torrent or a strip of dry sand, according to the season of\r\nthe year. The eyes could follow across flat lands, treeless, except for\r\na few low-growing willows, to far, blue, mysterious mountains. It was\r\na very empty land, empty of people and towns, of trees and cultivated\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe people on the northern ranch were but two miles from a village,\r\nwith friends, a post office and a church, and San Francisco, a real\r\ncity, not far away nor hard to reach. When Aunt Margaret came to Los\r\nCerritos there was not a railroad nor a street car within five hundred\r\nmiles, and Los Angeles, the small village, was sixteen miles away--by\r\nhorse power, not gasoline or electricity.\r\n\r\nHowever, distance did not prevent the making of good friends, and the\r\nisolation of the frontier life was broken by an occasional visit to San\r\nFrancisco, one or two trips to distant Maine (Aunt Margaret traveled\r\nEast on the first through sleeper to go over the new railroad), and by\r\nthe coming of visitors from neighboring ranches or from away.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the ranch welcomed for a week the officers of the\r\nflag-ship, Pensacola, anchored at San Pedro, including Admiral\r\nThatcher, an old friend of the family, who was in command of the\r\nPacific squadron.\r\n\r\nOften there was unexpected company in this land of great distances and\r\nfew inns. Even after my day wayfarers used occasionally to drop in, so\r\nthat it was necessary to be prepared to double a meal on short notice.\r\nLiebig’s Extract of Beef many a time counteracted in soup the weakening\r\neffect of quantity-extending water. Locked up in a large tin box a\r\nripening fruit cake awaited an emergency call for dessert, and there\r\nwas always an unlimited supply of mutton and chickens.\r\n\r\nThe young people did not have time to be lonely. Uncle Jotham was\r\nengaged in building up a large sheep business and Aunt Margaret had her\r\nsister for company; she had her children and sufficient help so that\r\nshe did not suffer any of the hardships that are usually associated\r\nwith pioneer life. I have observed that if a woman is occupied with\r\na young family, and of a reasonably contented disposition it makes no\r\ngreat difference whether the people outside her home are near or far,\r\nfew or many;--there are books for spare minutes.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to some to know how we happened to come into\r\nSouthern California, and something of the history of the ranches,\r\nLos Cerritos, “The Little Hills,” and Los Alamitos, “The Little\r\nCottonwoods”--beautiful, lilting Spanish names, either one of which\r\nwould have been preferable to the name chosen by those who bought of\r\nthe ranch lands and promoted the seaside town of Long Beach. I am glad\r\nthat we are free of responsibility for the choice of that prosaic name,\r\nor for the dubbing of Cerritos Hill, Signal, because of the presence on\r\nits top of a tripod used as a marker by surveyors.\r\n\r\nWhen my father sailed up the western coast on the Fourth of July,\r\n1851, the old S. S. Northerner, unseaworthy, hugged the coast, nearly\r\nwrecking herself by the way, on the rocks at Point Firmin; he, from\r\nhis place on the deck looked across the mesa to Cerritos Hill, and\r\nwatched the vaqueros at work with cattle, and like many a later comer,\r\nwas captivated by the country and determined, if possible, sometime\r\nto possess a portion of that land. The time came in 1866, when Flint,\r\nBixby & Co. bought from Don Juan Temple the Rancho Los Cerritos,\r\npaying him for it in San Francisco twenty thousand dollars in gold,\r\nor about seventy-five cents an acre for the twenty-seven thousand\r\nacres, without allowing anything for the fine adobe hacienda with its\r\nItalian garden. The reason that this was possible was that the owner\r\nwas growing old and anxious to settle his affairs so that he might go\r\nwith his family to spend the remainder of his life in Paris. Moreover,\r\nbusiness conditions in Southern California were bad at the time, owing\r\nnot only to the war depression of the country in general, but also to\r\nthe disastrous drouth during the years ’62-’63 and ’63-’64, during\r\nwhich practically no rain fell. The raising of cattle had been up\r\nto this time the chief industry, but with the failure of vegetation\r\nthousands of them starved to death. It is told that it became necessary\r\nfor the citizens of Anaheim, where their fine irrigation system kept\r\ntheir colony green, to use their surrounding willow hedge as a defense\r\nand post men to fight off the inrush of the famished cattle. It was the\r\nwiping out of this industry that brought about the sale of many of the\r\nlarge holdings of land in Southern California and was the beginning of\r\nthe development of varied industries and the opening of the land for\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe lands which came into the possession of our family about this time\r\nwere those of Don Abel Stearns and Don Juan Temple, who were both heavy\r\nlosers as the result of the drouth.\r\n\r\nBoth these men came to Los Angeles from Boston before 1830 and were\r\namong the first Americans to settle in the pueblo. They married native\r\nCalifornians and adapted themselves to the life of the community they\r\nhad chosen for their home, and their names occur frequently in all\r\naccounts of early Los Angeles affairs.\r\n\r\nThey both owned city property. Stearns’s home, El Palacio, was on the\r\nsite of the Baker Block, near the plaza. In 1859 he built at the rear,\r\nfacing Los Angeles Street and looking down Aliso the Arcadia Block,\r\nnamed for his wife Arcadia de Bandini. For this building he used bricks\r\nfrom the first local kiln. In order to complete it he borrowed twenty\r\nthousand dollars from Michael Reese on a mortgage on the Rancho Los\r\nAlamitos, and because of his great losses of cattle during the great\r\ndrouth of the sixties he was unable to repay the loan and so lost the\r\nranch.\r\n\r\nJohn Temple’s general merchandise store stood where the post office\r\ndoes today. In 1859, the same year that marked the building of the\r\nArcadia Block, he built at a cost of forty thousand dollars and\r\ndelivered to the city a market house surmounted by a town clock with\r\na bell “fine toned and sonorous.” This was the court house of my\r\nchildhood and its clock ordered our days. It stood where the new Los\r\nAngeles City Hall is now rising. He, with his brother, F. P. A. Temple\r\nbuilt the fine block that marked the northern junction of Spring and\r\nMain Streets and has stood until this day of rerouting of Spring\r\nStreet. By the way, the cutting out of the diagonal part of this street\r\nmarks the final disappearance of the last bit of the oldest road in\r\ntown, that which followed the base of the hills out to the brea pits\r\nwhich were the source of their roofing material. Temple Street was\r\noriginally a gift of John Temple to the city, and the suggestion\r\nthat its name be changed to Beverly Boulevard does not meet with the\r\napproval of those who know what this man meant to the young city. He\r\nwas one of ten Americans who came to Los Angeles before 1830 and might\r\nwell become the patron saint of those later men out of the east who\r\ncome to develop us; for it is due to his public spirit they must trace\r\nall the land titles of the city. When after we had come under the rule\r\nof the United States it seemed advisable to survey Los Angeles the\r\nimpecunious city council had no money so Temple provided the necessary\r\nthree thousand to pay for the Ord Survey upon which all titles are\r\nbased.\r\n\r\nAt one time he extended his operations into Mexico where he acquired\r\nlands and wealth, part of the latter due to an arrangement with\r\nthe Mexican government whereby he and his son-in-law performed\r\nthe functions of a mint, making the money for the government on a\r\ncommission basis.\r\n\r\nThose who are interested in seeing pictures of the don and his lady,\r\nwho dreamed and built the Cerritos House and garden may find old\r\nportraits in the museum at Exposition Park.\r\n\r\nAs for the ranches, Cerritos and Alamitos, they were both part of the\r\ngreat grant of land made to Don Manual Nieto in 1784 by Governor Don\r\nPedro Fages, representing the King of Spain. This grant amounted to\r\nabout two hundred thousand acres which extended between the San Gabriel\r\nand Santa Ana rivers and from the sea back to the first foothills. It\r\nwas the first of four grants made to retired soldiers before 1800.\r\nThe second was the San Pedro to Juan Jose Dominguez and the third was\r\nthe San Rafael to Jose Maria Verdugo. The fourth was beyond the Santa\r\nAna river, the Santiago, granted to N. Grijalva and which early in the\r\nnineteenth century was divided between his two daughters, one the wife\r\nof Jose Antonio Yorba, the other of Juan Pablo Peralta. Don Antonio\r\nMaria Lugo who remembered back to 1790 is authority for this order of\r\ngrants.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Don Manuel Nieto his lands were divided into four\r\nparcels for his heirs. The Rancho Santa Gertrudis, upon which Downey\r\nand Rivera now stand, went to Doña Josefa Cota de Nieto, the widow of\r\na son; Los Alamitos, Los Coyotes and Palo Alto were the portion of\r\nDon Juan Jose Nieto, the new head of the family; Los Bolsas was the\r\nportion of Doña Catarina Ruiz, and Los Cerritos that of Doña Manuela\r\nNieto de Cota, whose title to it was confirmed in 1834 by Governor\r\nJose Figueroa on behalf of the Mexican government. In December, 1843,\r\njudicial possession was given John Temple, he having paid each of the\r\ntwelve children of Doña Manuela the sum of two hundred and seventy-five\r\ndollars and seventy-five cents. He also paid someone twenty-five\r\ndollars for the ranch branding iron and the right to use it. I presume\r\nthat this went with the ranch and was the familiar triangle with a\r\ncurly tail that I knew in my childhood. Temple at once proceeded to\r\nbuild his house and lay out his Italian garden.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1866 when Flint, Bixby & Co. bought the Cerritos. At the time\r\nof the purchase my father’s younger brother, Jotham Bixby was made\r\nmanager, and was given the privilege of buying in at any time. In 1869\r\na half interest was deeded him, and the ranch carried on by him and the\r\nolder firm under the name of J. Bixby & Co.\r\n\r\nWhen California came under United States rule there ensued much\r\nconfusion as to land titles and all must be reviewed and passed upon by\r\na specified commission. I have seen a formidable looking transcript of\r\nthese proceedings in regard to Los Cerritos, copied out in long hand\r\nwith many a Spencerian flourish, rolled in a red morocco leather cover\r\nand tied with blue tape, all of which went to confirm the title of the\r\nland to Don Temple.\r\n\r\nThe deed from J. Temple to Flint, Bixby & Co. and the later one of\r\none-half interest from that firm to Jotham Bixby are in the vaults of\r\nthe Bixby offices in Long Beach.\r\n\r\nBecause of the possible interest of the many thousand land holders now\r\nin Long Beach and Signal Hill I recapitulate the list of early owners\r\nof the land. The first of record is Don Manual Nieto, 1784; from him it\r\nwent to his daughter Manuela de Cota and later to her twelve heirs; Don\r\nJuan Temple bought it in 1843, and Flint, Bixby & Co. in 1866, selling\r\na half interest to Jotham Bixby in 1869. In 1880 four thousand acres\r\nof this were sold to the American Colony under the leadership of W.\r\nE. Willmore and from this beginning has gone into the ownership of an\r\nuntold number. The name at first was Willmore City but was changed to\r\nLong Beach about four years later when it was bought by a group of men\r\ninterested in developing it as a Chautauqua town.\r\n\r\nThe ranch was held intact for some time after its purchase by my people\r\nand used at first almost exclusively for the grazing of sheep, at one\r\ntime there being as many as thirty thousand upon it. Later cattle were\r\nadded, but not allowed to range at will as in the Mexican days, but\r\nconfined in large fenced fields or potreros.\r\n\r\nJust how or when Abel Stearns came into possession of the adjoining\r\nAlamitos I do not know; from time to time he bought this and adjacent\r\nland until he owned 200,000 acres lying between the San Gabriel and\r\nSanta Ana rivers and for a number of years he maintained large flocks\r\nand herds there. He built the present ranch house and used it for his\r\ncountry residence.\r\n\r\nThere were very neighborly relations between him and the Temples over\r\non the adjoining ranch,--seven miles between houses meant little in\r\nthose days. A friendly rivalry existed between them as to the relative\r\nspeed of their horses and a race was an annual affair, the course\r\nbeing from Cerritos Hill to and around a post on the bluff where\r\nAlamitos Ave. in Long Beach now reaches the sea, four miles in all.\r\nHorse racing was a favorite sport of the time and many stories have\r\ncome down to us, among them one of these Temple-Stearns affairs. The\r\nstake was a thousand head of cattle and was won by Beserero, Temple’s\r\nrather ungainly horse. On this occasion there was great rejoicing at\r\nCerritos, celebrations and feasting that lasted all night.\r\n\r\nBut the great drouth of ’62-’64 ended these halcyon days. Temple sold\r\nthe Cerritos, dying almost immediately afterward. Stearns lost the\r\nAlamitos to Michael Reese, the money lender of San Francisco. My uncle\r\nJotham used to say that this Mr. Reese was famous for his excessive\r\nthrift and that he came to his end thereby. It seems that he wished to\r\nvisit a certain cemetery that charged a five cents admission fee, and\r\nthat he, in order to save his money, attempted to climb over the wall,\r\nbut slipped and fell, breaking his neck.\r\n\r\nSoon after the drouth the whole twenty-nine thousand acres of the\r\nAlamitos had been advertised for sale for $153, delinquent taxes, but\r\nno buyer appeared.\r\n\r\nIn the seventies it came on the market at a tempting price and young\r\nJohn Bixby, who was working for his cousin Jotham as ranch carpenter,\r\nand his wife Susan Hathaway coveted it. The wife had been in California\r\nfor a number of years and had seen the process by which Jotham with\r\nhelp had been able to change from a small rancher to the prosperous\r\nmanager and half owner of the Cerritos and urged her husband to make\r\nthe attempt to do likewise. First he was to see the big Los Angeles\r\nbanker, I. W. Hellman. He said he would go into this purchase if Jotham\r\nBixby would; the latter said he would if Flint, Bixby would. They all\r\nwould and so it came about the Alamitos was secured, Mr. Hellman owning\r\none-third, J. Bixby & Co., another third and young John Bixby in as\r\nmanager with the chance to earn his third.\r\n\r\nThis ranch, like the Cerritos, had been cattle range before it became\r\nsheep range; unlike the former it has continued to this day as a stock\r\nranch, and although it is many years since there have been sheep it is\r\nwell known for its cattle, horses, and mules. All the eastern portion\r\nof Long Beach, including Bixby Park, that famous center of annual state\r\npicnics, came from the Alamitos, and it was John Bixby himself who\r\nbought and planted the trees that now shelter the multitudes and afford\r\nfoci for the gathering of the wandering inhabitants from each and every\r\nIowa county. (There were sixty thousand of them at the last picnic, I\r\nhave been told.)\r\n\r\nMany people now familiar with Southern California have seen the old\r\nhouse surrounded by trees that is on the brow of a hill out on Anaheim\r\nRoad beyond the Long Beach Municipal Golf Links. That is the old\r\nAlamitos Ranch house. When my uncle and aunt first went there to live\r\nit was almost a ruin, having fallen during the Reese period from the\r\nhigh estate it had known when it was the summer home of the lovely\r\nArcadia de Bandini de Stearns. The only growing things about it were\r\none small eucalyptus tree and one fair sized pepper tree.\r\n\r\nThe front room had been used as a calf-pen and the whole house was\r\ninfested with rats. Uncle John told me that the first night they slept\r\nthere the baby demanded a drink, and in his passage to the kitchen to\r\nsecure one he counted sixteen of the rodents. The first improvement\r\nthey made was to cover all the holes in baseboards and walls with\r\nportions of kerosene cans.\r\n\r\nIt was what grandfather called a “notable housewife” that undertook\r\nthe rehabilitation of that wreck of a house. Gradually as the young\r\ncouple got ahead improvements were made, each one to be rejoiced in and\r\nenthused about by the interested visiting relatives. I remember when\r\ncertain doors were cut, when the windows were enlarged, when the first\r\nlawn went in, when two fuchsia bushes were brought from Los Angeles,\r\n(one of them is still in its place, bravely blossoming), and a rare\r\nyellow calla. Aunt Susan took care of the chickens, with the privilege\r\nof spending all her returns for books; great was the occasion when a\r\nbig stuffed armed chair could be purchased for the young head of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nLittle by little changes were made in the building itself, that added\r\nto both its comfort and its charm. One of the first was the building\r\nof a high tank with its cool house underneath which has served more\r\nthan forty years for the storing of food; only recently a self-icing\r\nrefrigerator has come to its aid. To supply this tank with water a busy\r\nram down by the spring, over-hung with willows and decked with water\r\nhyacinths, steadily chug-chugged its days and nights away.\r\n\r\nA bath room shortly followed, its installation holding the excited\r\nimagination of the children; a little later the house sprouted a wing,\r\ncontaining two bedrooms, “No. 1” and “No. 2,” and the moving of dining\r\nroom and kitchen three times marked the expansion of the home.\r\n\r\nThe growing habits of the place persist; it is alive. Each time I go\r\nback I find some new thing, now a garden, now a modern heating plant\r\nskillfully contrived to circumvent the cellarless condition and massive\r\nwalls, last of all a cactus garden boasting some imported sand to\r\nsimulate a desert, but crying out for rocks and stones, which are not\r\nto be found in adobe soil.\r\n\r\nThe vision and industry of one little woman made from the dilapidated\r\npile of mud bricks one of California’s most charming homes, whose\r\ngenerous hospitality, continued by her son and his wife, have made the\r\nold place widely known. It is a rare thing in this new country to find\r\na house that has been occupied continuously by one family for almost\r\nfifty years.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this ranch house the one at Cerritos has fallen from its\r\nhigh estate and is now but a shell of its old self. It has long been\r\ndeserted and has been kept in repair only sufficient to prevent its\r\nmeeting the fate of neglected adobes, that of melting away under the\r\nwinter rains.\r\n\r\nLittle do the many people who daily pass it on their way to Long Beach\r\ndream of its former beauty, its gay and busy life.\r\n\r\nDon Juan Temple planned and built it about 1844. For it he imported\r\nbricks from the East, shipping them around the Horn. They were used in\r\nthe foundation of the house, for paving two long verandas, for marking\r\noff the garden beds, and for lining a sixty-foot well and building a\r\nlarge cistern.\r\n\r\nFrom the northern forests of the state he obtained handhewn redwood\r\nwhich he used for the beams, floors and other interior woodwork, and\r\nfor the twelve-foot fence about the large garden.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the house were made from the usual large slabs of\r\nsun-dried adobe, made on the spot. They were moulded in frames\r\nconstructed for making nine or twelve at a time; this frame was laid on\r\na level bit of ground and packed with clay-like mud, into which straw\r\nhad been tramped by the bare feet of the Indians; when exposure to the\r\nsun had caused the shrinking away of the bricks from the wood, the\r\nframe was lifted and the slabs left for further drying out.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a child there was a pit below the house, near the river\r\nwhere water could be obtained easily, in which I have watched the\r\nmixing of the adobe; I saw the bricks made in small quantities for\r\npurposes of repair or the building of a new wall.\r\n\r\nThe house was built with a two-storied central portion a hundred feet\r\nlong, with two one-storied wings about one hundred and sixty feet in\r\nlength, extending toward the river. The ends of these were joined by\r\na high adobe wall in which there was a single gate, its heavy wooden\r\ndoors being closed at night during its earlier history, but seldom\r\nduring the later period.\r\n\r\nOriginally the roofs were flat and roofed in the usual Southern\r\nCalifornia fashion, first a layer of redwood planks, then a covering\r\nof sand or gravel over which was poured hot brea (asphaltum) from the\r\nopen beds beyond Los Angeles. These were the same brea pits in which in\r\nrecent years the remarkable discoveries of pre-historic animal bones\r\nhave been made. In the days when my father and uncles first came to\r\nCalifornia there were many dangerous wild animals still at large, but\r\nfortunately the mastodons and sabre-tooth tigers, hyenas and milder\r\ncamels were all safely put away in brea storage.\r\n\r\nWhen the summer sun was hot on the roofs the asphalt grew so soft that\r\nwe could dig it out with sticks and shape it with our fingers. Such\r\ndepredations undoubtedly contributed to the unsatisfactoriness of the\r\noverhead shelter, but even without our intervention the alternate\r\nshrinking and expansion of the substance made the roof more or less\r\nlike a sieve in winter. Uncle Jotham soon tired of rain inside the\r\nhouse in winter, no matter how much he prayed for it outside, so that\r\nvery soon after he moved into the adobe he added a good old-fashioned\r\nYankee roof to the main portion of the house. The roofs on the wings\r\ndid not come until after I had learned the joy of the flat ones. Here\r\nwe used to go at sunset to wait for the homecoming of the fathers, for\r\nwhose returning buggies we could watch from this vantage ground. We\r\nalso could see the whole sunset sky, and the lovely pink lights on far,\r\nfaint Baldy.\r\n\r\nThe outside of the house, as was the custom with adobes, was kept trim\r\nwith frequent coats of whitewash; the doors, window frames and slender\r\nbalusters of the upper veranda railing were a soft green, like the\r\ntones on old copper. In the lower story the windows were iron-barred,\r\nand in the outer walls of the wing, high up, were funnel-shaped holes\r\nthrough which guns might be shot if any necessity for defense arose.\r\n\r\nIt may be because of these features that some people have called this\r\nan old fort, but it never was one in any other sense than that a man’s\r\nhouse is his castle. However the use of guns was more or less free in\r\nthose old frontier days and an occasion might arise when the man inside\r\nmight be very glad of a chance to defend himself such as those loop\r\nholes afforded.\r\n\r\nIt was on this ranch that one of the battles at the time of the\r\nAmerican occupation occurred. It is recorded that the Californians\r\nunder Carillo here met, one night, Col. Stockton’s forces which had\r\nlanded at San Pedro; the Californians, by driving back and forth in the\r\ndarkness a large herd of horses, succeeded in giving the impression\r\nof a much larger force than they really had. Perhaps they were horses\r\nbelonging to Don Temple and Don Stearns and to the neighboring\r\nDominguez ranch.\r\n\r\nThe approach to the house was through the large gate in the wall that\r\nclosed the patio. I think the court never was planted to any extent,\r\nthe garden being on the farther side of the house. It afforded only a\r\nfew locust trees, one large pink oleander and several hitching posts.\r\nThere was always much going and coming here, for the ranch business\r\ninvolved the use of saddle horses and carriages. The animals were kept\r\nin the barns beyond, but were brought here for all family saddles\r\nor carriages. It was a sunny, friendly, busy place, much loved and\r\nfrequented by the many cats and dogs. I remember also a coon that\r\nlived in a far corner for a time and some little coyotes that had been\r\nbrought in from the range.\r\n\r\nIn the right wing, next the foreman’s room, was the store room,\r\npossibly more interesting because it was kept locked and only\r\noccasionally did we get access to the dried apples, the chocolate, the\r\nbrown sugar and the fragrant lead foil that came in the gay boxes of\r\nChinese tea. Many a wise mother-cat entered the fastness through the\r\nlong window closed only by the iron bars where we could admire but not\r\nhandle her babies.\r\n\r\nOne day I discovered a very beautiful heavy white smoke pouring out\r\nthis window and hurried to find help. Father and the men who came had\r\ngreat difficulty in putting out the fire that had been caused by the\r\ndrying-out and self-ignition of some stick phosphorous, kept for the\r\npreparation of poisoned wheat for use in the war with the squirrels who\r\nwould have liked to eat up all the wheat we had raised.\r\n\r\nNext to the store-room was a double-sized room, the usual one being\r\nsquare, the size of the width of the building. Here was a great\r\nchimney with a bellows and forge, and on the other side a long bench\r\nwell-supplied with carpenter’s tools. One of our favorite occupations\r\nwas to hunt up odd pieces of lead pipe, cut them into bits, beat\r\nthem flat on the anvil and fold over into book-like shapes which we\r\ndecorated with nail-prick design. I think it speaks something for the\r\ntastes of our elders that it was books we made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATIO--RANCHO LOS CERRITOS--1872]\r\n\r\nAcross the court was the kitchen where Ying reigned supreme, and Fan\r\nwas his prime minister. Later Fan, having passed his apprenticeship,\r\nmoved on to be head cook at the Alamitos.\r\n\r\nWhen Aunt Margaret had first come to the ranch to live there was no\r\nstove in the kitchen, and the first morning she went down she found\r\nher Indian boy kindling a fire by the friction of a couple of pieces\r\nof wood. The baking was done, even after the installation of a range,\r\nin a large brick oven out in the rear court, and Saturday afternoon\r\nwitnessed the perfection of pies, bread, cake. Once I remember feasting\r\non a sand-hill crane, that, too big for the kitchen stove, had been\r\nbaked in this out-door oven.\r\n\r\nI have been asked about the character of the meals and the sources of\r\nfood supply at the ranches. As was customary at the time there was\r\nmore served than is usual at present. At breakfast there was always\r\neggs, or meat,--steaks, chops, sausage--potatoes, hot bread, stewed\r\nfruit, doughnuts and cheese, and coffee for some of the grown folks.\r\nDinner came at noon and frequently began with soup, followed by a\r\nroast, potatoes, two other fresh vegetables, with pickles, olives and\r\npreserves. Salads were unknown, but we sometimes had lettuce leaves,\r\ndressed with vinegar and sugar. For dessert there were puddings or\r\npies or cake and canned fruit, and cheese. It will surprise some of\r\nthe younger folk to know that mush--either cracked wheat or oatmeal\r\nor cornmeal was a supper dish. Sometimes the main article was creamed\r\ntoast, and there might be hot biscuit, with jelly or honey or jam,\r\nand perhaps cold meat, and always again doughnuts and the constant\r\ncheese--very new for some tastes and very old for others.\r\n\r\nAs for the supplies--the meat all came from the ranch. Every day a\r\nsheep was killed--occasionally a beef. Uncle John at the Alamitos built\r\na smoke house and cured hams. There were chickens and ducks, tame and\r\nin season wild.\r\n\r\nThe staple groceries came from Los Angeles in wholesale\r\nquantities--sugar and flour in barrels, navy beans and frijoles and\r\ngreen coffee in sacks, the latter frequently the source of delicious\r\nodors from the kitchen oven while roasting; it was daily ground for the\r\nbreakfast drink, and the sound of the little mill was almost the first\r\nindication of stirring life.\r\n\r\nAt San Justo the vegetables grew in the garden but at the southern\r\nranches they were bought once a week from the loaded express wagon of\r\na Chinese peddler, whose second function was to bring news and company\r\nto the faithful ranch cook and his helper. There was always a plentiful\r\nsupply of vegetables and the quality was of the best. I remember\r\nhearing Aunt Susan tell that her man had brought strawberries to the\r\ndoor every week in the year and she had purchased them except on two\r\nJanuary occasions when the berries were not quite ripe.\r\n\r\nThe chief beverage was water, there was some tea and coffee, never\r\nwine or other liquor, except the delicious product of the fall cider\r\nmill. Whiskey stood on the medicine shelf and I suppose sometimes\r\nafforded relief to masculine colds, or insured against possible snake\r\nbite--which never occurred.\r\n\r\nOranges, lemons, figs, and grapes grew in the Cerritos garden, and\r\napples and pears in the orchards, peaches, plums, and apricots were\r\nbought from peddlers. Much fruit was canned and fresh apple sauce was\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nThe two Chinamen prepared and served three meals a day to the family,\r\nthree to the regular men, put up noon lunches for those working away\r\nfrom the house, and at the Alamitos three more meals to the nine or ten\r\nmilkers who could not eat at the same time as the other men. After this\r\ndigression I return to the listing of the Cerritos rooms.\r\n\r\nNext the kitchen came the men’s dining room, which contained a long\r\ntable, covered with oil-cloth and flanked by wooden benches; the\r\nconstant fragrance of mutton-stew and onions, of frijoles and strong\r\ncoffee was more attractive to a hungry nose than the odors chastened\r\nfor the family meals. Harry frequently ate with the men but I couldn’t.\r\nThere are certain disadvantages in being a carefully brought up girl.\r\n\r\nFollowing down the line of rooms in the left wing one came next upon\r\na wood-room which was given over to many tiers of willow wood, a very\r\nnecessary adjunct to a kitchen when cooking for as many as thirty\r\npeople must be done with that light wood for fuel.\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining laundry, lighted only by two doors in the thick\r\nwalls we could weekly watch, admire, and try to imitate the skillful\r\nsprinkling of the clothes in the approved Chinese manner,--a fine spray\r\nblown from the mouth. In those days there were no germs!\r\n\r\nThe last of the series, opening into the court-yard, was the milk room\r\nwhere the rows of shining pans afforded us unstinted supplies of cream\r\nboth for the interesting barrel-churns and for the table,--clotted\r\ncream thick enough to spread with a knife upon hot baking powder\r\nbiscuits, or a steaming baked potato. I am glad I can remember it, for\r\nthere is no evidence now-a-days that such cream ever was.\r\n\r\nA second court off to one side was formed by the row of barns, sheds,\r\nthe granary, the hen houses, each offering a different chance to play.\r\nOn one occasion when we had climbed the outside ladder to the high\r\ndoor in the granary, when it was full of wheat, we tried the difficult\r\nfeat of chasing mice across the top of the huge, soft mass of grain.\r\nOne small boy who was fast enough to catch a mouse by the tail had the\r\nunpleasant experience of having it turn and bury its little teeth in\r\nthe back of his hand.\r\n\r\nThere was a corn crib nearer the barn and I think I must have filled my\r\nmouth at some time full of the hard yellow kernels, for otherwise how\r\nwould I have acquired knowledge of certain sensations to enable me to\r\ndream from time to time that my teeth have suddenly all fallen loose\r\ninto my mouth, very much over-crowding it?\r\n\r\nOnce across this court I saw a rebellious young colt who objected to\r\nbeing “broken,” walk magnificently on his hind legs, and it was here\r\nthat Silverheel, the father of all the colts, and otherwise honored\r\nas a trotter who had won races, showed his superior intelligence,\r\nwhen loosed in the barn which was on fire, by dashing out, rolling in\r\nthe dirt and extinguishing the blaze in his mane. It made so great\r\nan impression upon my little cousin Fanny that some time later when\r\nher apron caught at a bonfire she promptly followed his example and\r\nundoubtedly saved her life by her prompt action.\r\n\r\nTo enter the house from the court, we stepped up to the brick terrace\r\nand through a wide, low door into a short hall that opened directly\r\nopposite into the garden. In this hall was a narrow, steep stairway,\r\nunder which was a fascinating closet where choice bridles and old coats\r\nand boots were kept; where there were boxes of mixed nails and bolts\r\nand screws and tacks; on the shelf forward could be found some plug\r\ntobacco, some small square bunches of California matches, some candles,\r\nand a pile of pink bar soap for use at the veranda washstand. I know\r\nyet the smell of that closet.\r\n\r\nOn the right was a door into the parlor, so low that tall Uncle John\r\nhad to stoop to enter; across the hall was the spare room. All other\r\nrooms opened directly on the long outdoor corridor.\r\n\r\nThe rooms were dimly lighted because the windows were high, rather\r\nsmall, and, on account of the thickness of the adobe wall, deep-set;\r\nupstairs there was more light as those walls were but two-feet thick,\r\nthe lower ones being about three. At the Alamitos one of the first\r\nthings Aunt Susan did was to cut the windows to the floor. This was\r\nnever done at Cerritos.\r\n\r\nThe parlor was a small square room with one window to the court and\r\none to the front veranda. The walls were covered with a light flowered\r\npaper, and on them hung four steel engravings of the “Voyage of Life,”\r\nand the familiar picture of Lincoln and his son Tad. A large walnut\r\nbook-case occupied one side of the room. Its drawers at the base were\r\nfilled with blocks and toys for the downstairs delectation of the\r\nsuccession of babies in the home. A Franklin stove in one corner kept\r\nus snug and warm when the ocean chill crept inland. The furniture was\r\ncovered with a maroon leather, a set exactly like the one in the office\r\nat San Justo. I associate the reading of many books with one of those\r\ncomfortable, stuffed chairs, among them _Two Years Before the Mast_,\r\nand _Oliver Twist_.\r\n\r\nAt the table in the center of the room father and Uncle Jotham spent\r\nmany a long evening over interminable series of cribbage, and my books\r\nare punctuated by “fifteen two, fifteen four and a run is eight.” Uncle\r\nJotham’s convulsive shakings made his amusement visible rather than\r\naudible.\r\n\r\nOne night Nan was desperately ill with the croup and was wrapped up\r\nbefore the fire in this room while one of the older cousins rode in\r\nhaste to Compton for the doctor. When he returned he tied his horse\r\nhurriedly in the stall in the barn, leaving too long a rope, with the\r\nresult that somehow, during the night, the poor horse became entangled\r\nand was strangled to death, a hard reward to him for his successful\r\neffort to save the life of a little girl.\r\n\r\nAnother memory of this room--of a Sunday afternoon. We had all been\r\nover to camp-meeting at Gospel Swamp, not that we were much addicted to\r\ncamp-meeting, but it was the only available service within reach, and\r\nof course we had to go to church on Sunday. We sat on wooden benches\r\nin the dust under the willows, not an altogether unpleasant change\r\nfrom the usual pew, at least for the children, and Aunt Adelaide, who\r\nwas camping there for the week, took us to her tent afterward and\r\ngave us some watermelon before we drove the few miles back to the\r\nranch. But Uncle Jotham had a more exciting aftermath. He and papa\r\nand I were reading in the parlor after dinner when suddenly he gave a\r\ntremendous jump and ran upstairs three steps at a time, where we soon\r\nheard a great noise of tramping. In a minute or two he came down with\r\na dead lizard almost a foot long spread on his New York Tri-weekly\r\nTribune. Evidently it had mounted his bootleg over at camp-meeting\r\nand lain dormant for a couple of hours before attempting further\r\nexplorations. The first jump came when the little feet struck my\r\nuncle’s knees--harmless, but uncanny.\r\n\r\nThe usual gathering place for the family was the wide porch where the\r\nsun upon the rose vines flecked the floor with shadows. The bricks that\r\npaved this open corridor were laid in an herring-bone pattern and we\r\noften practised walking with our feet set squarely on them in order to\r\ncounteract any tendency we might have to pigeon-toedness.\r\n\r\nBeside the central door was a space in the wall held sacred and never\r\ntouched at regular white-washing time. Here was kept a record of the\r\nvarying heights of the family from year to year so that we could keep\r\ntrack of our growing prowess. Uncle John, at six feet, topped the\r\nlist for his generation, but was ultimately passed by his son and two\r\nnephews.\r\n\r\nA Mexican olla, embedded in sand in a high box, and a long handled tin\r\ndipper provided convenient drinking facilities, and a tin wash bowl,\r\nnearby, just outside the dining room door, was a peremptory invitation\r\nto clean hands for dinner.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the porch, near grandfather’s room, was a very\r\nlong, knotted, twine hammock, in which we rolled ourselves and held\r\ntight for a high swing. I had first known this hammock among the\r\ntrees in the yard at Skowhegan, but it had come to California with\r\ngrandfather and Aunt Martha. It had belonged to Uncle Philo Hathaway,\r\nwho, in order to earn money to complete his college course at Amherst,\r\nhad been cruising a year with Admiral Thatcher as his private\r\nsecretary. He evidently contracted Panama fever while in Caribbean\r\nwaters, for on his way home he died, and was buried at sea. The loss of\r\nthis promising young man was a great grief to all who knew him but to\r\nhis nephews and nieces who had come into this world after he left it,\r\nhe was a very shadowy figure.\r\n\r\nThe already long veranda was extended at each end by an arbor, hung\r\nwith bunches of the small mission grapes, which Harry and I were wont\r\nto squeeze in our grimy handkerchiefs over a tin cup for the purpose of\r\nmaking wine.\r\n\r\nThe garden spread before the porch, at least two acres, shut in from\r\nintruders and sheltered from the ocean winds by the high fence. It\r\nwas laid out in three tiers of four beds, each about fifty feet\r\nsquare, with a wide border about the whole. They were separated by\r\nwalks, edged with more of the imported brick. Near the house were\r\nflowers and shrubs, but further away grapes were planted, and oranges,\r\npomegranates, and figs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the rose-shaded path leading from the front door stood a\r\nsummer house, bowered in the white-blossomed Madeira vine and set in\r\na thick bed of blue-flowered periwinkle, which I never quite dared to\r\ninvade, lest it harbor a snake. California children were taught never\r\nto step where they could not see. Under the seat in this little shelter\r\nwere kept the mallets and balls for the croquet set. I wonder if others\r\nfound the mallets attractive crutches, I believe it was as much fun\r\nplaying lame as it was playing legitimate croquet.\r\n\r\nBeyond the summer house was the large brick cistern and the old well.\r\nWhen Mr. Temple first made a garden he provided the necessary water by\r\nusing a ram in the river below the hill. In those days there was much\r\nwater below the hill for the Los Angeles and San Gabriel united their\r\nwaters and poured them into the lowland from which there was no good\r\nopening into the sea. As a result the bottom lands were wooded and\r\nswampy. Then about 1860 floods came that washed open a channel into\r\nthe ocean, and another great storm caused the river to divide, sending\r\nmost of its water through what is now known as New River which crosses\r\nthe Alamitos further east and reaches the sea some ten miles from the\r\nold mouth. These changes, together with the increased use of water for\r\nvineyards and orchards in Los Angeles, lowered the river level so Don\r\nTemple dug a well, circular, six feet in diameter, and sixty feet deep.\r\nHis Indians drew the water by means of a long well-sweep. Little folk\r\nwere duly impressed with the danger of the old well, but there wasn’t\r\nenough fear to prevent an occasional peering into its black depths, and\r\nthe dropping of a stone that took so long to reach the water below.\r\nThe empty cistern could be entered by ladders without and within and\r\nafforded a diversion from time to time.\r\n\r\nWhen the Americans came the breezes of the sky were summoned to pump\r\nthe water from a new well outside the fence, and prosaic pipes carried\r\nit from the tank under the windmill to all parts of the garden.\r\n\r\nAll along the fence grew locust trees, whose blossoms are like white\r\nwisteria, and at their feet bloomed the pink Castilian roses brought to\r\nCalifornia by the Spanish padres. Over beyond the croquet ground there\r\nwas much anise among those roses--anise, the greenest, most feathery\r\ngrowing thing, and withal affording sweet seeds.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the far side, shading the small gate that led to the\r\nwool barn was a very large pepper tree into whose branches we could\r\nclimb, and near it grew many lilacs. Two of the walks held little\r\nbricked islands in which towered old Italian cypresses, whose smooth,\r\nsmall cones my cousin George assured the younger children were bat\r\neggs. That seemed reasonable--there must be some source for the many\r\nbats that swooped about at night.\r\n\r\nOn a certain south-east corner grew the Sweetwater grape, the first\r\nto ripen, and directly across the path from it was a curious green\r\nrose, one of the rare plants of the place. The blossoms were of the\r\nsame quality as the leaves, though shaped like petals. They were not\r\npretty, just odd. The pink roses nearby were lovely, and so were the\r\nprickly yellow Scotch roses. We loved the rich red of the Gloire de\r\nRosamonde,--isn’t that a more attractive name than Ragged Robin, or is\r\nit after all too imposing for the friendly, familiar rose? The best\r\none of all was the Chromatella whose great yellow buds hung over the\r\npale green balustrade of the upper balcony, like the Marecial Niel, but\r\nlarger and more perfect.\r\n\r\nIn spring, spreading beds of iris were purple with a hundred blossoms\r\nand the white ornithogalums, with their little black shoe-buttons\r\ndelighted us, while, later in the year, there were masses of blue\r\nagapanthus and pink amaryllis and scarlet spikes of red-hot-poker.\r\nThere were no single specimens of flowers, but always enough for us to\r\npick without censure.\r\n\r\nThe garden did not contain even one palm tree, or a bit of cactus,\r\nnor do I remember a eucalyptus tree, a variety belonging to a later\r\nimportation. There were two large bunches of pampas grass and two\r\nold century plants, which we desecrated in the usual child fashion\r\nby scratching names and pictures on the gray surface. There were no\r\nannuals.\r\n\r\nOrange blossoms, honey-suckle, lilac, and lemon verbena, roses,\r\noleander and heliotrope made a heaven of fragrance. For years the bees\r\nhad stored their treasure in the wall of grandfather’s room, which,\r\nbeing a wooden addition to the house, offered a hollow space; the odor\r\nof the honey mingled with that of the old leather bindings of his books\r\nin the room, and with the flowers outside. The linnets, friendly, and\r\ntwittering, built about the porch, and the swallows nested under the\r\neaves; the ruby-throated and iridescent humming birds darted from\r\nflower to flower and built their felt-like nests in the trees, and\r\ngreat lazy, yellow and black butterflies floated by.\r\n\r\nAnd children wandered here and played, or climbed the spreading tree\r\nfor the heavy figs bursting with their garnered sweetness, or picked\r\ncrimson kernels from the leathery pomegranates, or lying under the\r\ngreen roof of the low-spread grape vines, told fairy stories while\r\nfeasting. There seemed no limit to our capacity for eating fruit, and I\r\nnever knew any one to suffer. One morning at an eating race I won with\r\nthirty-two peaches, not large ones, fortunately.\r\n\r\nOver by the wind-mill was a boggy bed of mint, and many a brew of\r\nafternoon tea it afforded us,--mint tea in the summer house, with\r\nYing’s scalloped cookies, sparkling with sugar crystals, and our\r\nmothers for guests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GARDEN SIDE RANCHO LOS CERRITOS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII THE RANCH STORY CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\nCookies were not the only things in which Ying excelled. There were\r\ncakes fearfully and wonderfully decorated with frosting curly-cues,\r\nand custard pies so good that grandfather always included one with the\r\ndoughnuts and cheese that little David carried in his lunch basket when\r\nhe went up to visit his brother on the famous occasion when he slew\r\nGoliath with his sling shot.\r\n\r\nGrandfather had left his Maine home and now sat on the sunny California\r\nporch and charmed his child audience with versions of the Hebrew\r\nstories that I judge he did not use in the pulpit of the dignified\r\nvillage church where he had ministered for so many years. But these\r\nadaptations existed even then, for I know now that they were not made\r\nfor us but had served, a generation earlier, to delight our mothers.\r\nWe learned how Samson’s strength returned when, in the temple of\r\nthe Philistines, the hooting mob threw eggs at him. Grandfather was\r\nnot unaware of the characteristics of mobs, for he was an avowed\r\nabolitionist and advocate of women’s rights when they were unpopular\r\ncauses, although he himself was never favored with eggs. He used to\r\nagree with an old Quaker of a nearby town who said, “If a hen wants to\r\ncrow, thee’d better let her crow.”\r\n\r\nTo return to his stories: there was the legend of David. When the lion\r\nattacked his sheep he ran so fast to their rescue that his little\r\ncoat-tails stuck out straight behind him; when the lion opened his\r\nmouth to roar David reached down his throat and caught him by the roots\r\nof his tongue and held him, while, with his free hand he pulled his\r\njackknife out of his trousers pocket, opened it with his teeth, and\r\npromptly killed the beast. Then he sat down upon a great white stone\r\nand played on his jews-harp and sang, “Twinkle, twinkle, little star.”\r\n\r\nI once gave this form of the story in a Sunday School class as an\r\nobject lesson in earnestness in the pursuit of duty, and when my\r\nteacher kindly asked me where it was to be found, assured her that it\r\nmust be in one of the intervening Bible chapters that had been skipped\r\nin our course. Imagine my chagrin as I vainly sought the text. I must\r\nhave been fourteen years old at the time.\r\n\r\nGrandfather not only told us stories, but he opened Sunday to me for\r\nsecular reading. On my eighth birthday he had given me a copy of\r\nGrimm’s _Fairy Tales_, and I was revelling in them when a Sunday came,\r\nand, as we were settling ourselves on a blanket out on the grass under\r\nthe big eucalyptus tree for an afternoon with books, mother questioned\r\nthe wisdom of my reading such a book on that day. She said we would\r\nlet grandfather decide. I see him yet, looking over the tops of his\r\nspectacles at the eager little girl who had interrupted his reading;\r\n“I think,” he said, “that a book fit to read any day is fit to read on\r\nSunday.” I bless the memory of grandfather, willing to give a child his\r\nhonest judgment, and that that judgment was of a liberal mind.\r\n\r\nI remember that about this time there was a governess in the family who\r\nwas a member of the Universalist denomination and who sometimes pined\r\nfor her own church; to comfort her, grandfather told her that he would\r\nprepare and preach for her a Universalist sermon, which he did the\r\nfollowing Sunday. It may be that this small service on the old ranch\r\nporch was the first of this faith in Southern California. Grandfather’s\r\ncatholic sympathy for various religious faiths is also illustrated by\r\nhis friendship with Rabbi Edelman and his frequent attendance upon the\r\nservices in the old synagogue on Broadway near Second in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nI treasure a small round lacquer box that he bought for me once from\r\na Chinese peddler who had walked the dusty miles from Los Angeles,\r\nbalancing on a pole over his shoulder the two large covered bamboo\r\nbaskets, so familiar to the early Californian. The whole family\r\ngathered, while on the shady porch were spread the wonders of China.\r\n\r\nThere were nests of lacquer boxes, with graceful sprays of curious\r\ndesign in a dull gold; bread boats, black outside and vermillion\r\nwithin; Canton china, with pink and green people, flowers and\r\nbutterflies; teapots in basket cosies, covered cups without handles;\r\nchop-sticks and back-scratchers and carved card-cases, all in ivory;\r\nfeather fans with ivory or sandal wood carved sticks; toys, such\r\nas a dozen eggs in decreasing size packed one within another, tiny\r\ntortoises with quivering heads and legs in glass topped green boxes,\r\nor perplexing pieces of wood cut into such strange shapes that it took\r\nmuch skill and time to replace the blocks if once disturbed; there\r\nwas exquisite embroidery, shawls, or silk handkerchiefs, sometimes\r\nthere was one of the queer hanging baskets of flowers and fruit\r\nfashioned from feathers, silk and tinsel, that so delighted the Chinese\r\nthemselves but which the housewives rather dreaded receiving as New\r\nYear gifts from devoted servants; to top off there was always the\r\nstrange candy, ginger and lichee nuts. How could so many things come\r\nout of those baskets!\r\n\r\nIf the Chinaman was an essential part of the housekeeping, the Mexican\r\nwas an integral part of the ranch proper. When Mr. Temple lived at the\r\nCerritos he had great numbers of humble retainers who lived for the\r\nmost part in huts or jacals of tule or willow brush; some of the more\r\nfavored ones stayed in the wings facing the patio and others occupied\r\nthe older Cota house that stood near the river.\r\n\r\nMy cousin, George, who lived at the ranch all his boyhood, once wrote\r\nof these people: “The men of these families had been accustomed to work\r\noccasionally as vaqueros in the service of the rancho. There was always\r\nplenty of meat; and frijoles and chili, with mais del pais were to be\r\nraised under crude forms of cultivation at the foot of the hill. On\r\naccount of the death by starvation of the cattle on the over-stocked\r\nranges the occupation of these people was gone and they soon vanished\r\nseeking fields of usefulness elsewhere....\r\n\r\n“Among the Temple retainers, however, was one strong and stalwart\r\ncharacter, the most perfect horseman and acknowledged leader of the\r\nvaqueros, Juan Cañedo. He was manifestly attached to the land by strong\r\nties of sentiment, and set up the claim that Mr. Temple had sold him\r\nwith the ranch to Mr. Bixby, with whom he intended to stay.... This\r\nman was expert in the use of the reata--the left hand as well as the\r\nright--and was easily superior to any of those now exhibiting in the\r\nwild west shows. For those days this sort of thing was the life of the\r\npeople, not their pastime, and this was a picked man among them.”\r\n\r\nGeorge knew and loved Old Juan as long as he lived, provided for his\r\nold age, stayed with him when he died, and for many years paid monthly\r\nthe widow’s grocery bill.\r\n\r\nWhen the little boy was four his father had a saddle made especially\r\nfor him and Juan delighted to show him how to ride, to make a horseman\r\nof him; he also served as a teacher of Spanish. Juan never condescended\r\nto speak English, although he understood it, so my conversations with\r\nhim were one sided, for I regret to say that my knowledge of Spanish\r\nwas very meager.\r\n\r\nHe looked like a bronze statue, brown face, brown clothes, brown horse\r\nand infinite repose. Many a time have I seen him ride out of the\r\ncourtyard gate followed by the hounds, Duke, Queen, Timerosa, and\r\nothers of forgotten name, to hunt coyotes, the constant menace to the\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nThere were many other interesting men who worked at the ranches.\r\nThere was always a Jose; I remember a romantic looking Romulo,\r\nand Miguel, who is now spending his last days a tenant of the old\r\nhouse. Over at Alamitos there was a jolly, fat vaquero with a heavy\r\nblack beard and twinkling eyes, who was known as “Deefy”--I spell\r\nphonetically,--because scarlet fever at twelve had stolen his hearing.\r\nHe remembered enough of language to speak, but did so in the most\r\nuncanny, guttural and squeaking sounds. He was a friendly soul and\r\nnever so appalling as dignified Old Juan.\r\n\r\nThen there were all sorts of other nationalities represented in one\r\nway or another; Parlin, a Maine man, always predicting disaster, and\r\nspeaking only in a whisper; Roy, the Englishman, John “Portugee,” Henry\r\nand Charlie, young Americans getting a start, and the merry Irish John\r\nO’Connor who always had time for a joke with the children, and whose\r\ndeparture was mourned when he left the Cerritos to open a saloon on\r\nCommercial street in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nJust a few years ago at Uncle Jotham’s funeral in Long Beach I was\r\ntouched to see a whole pewful of these men who had worked for him in\r\nthe old days at the ranch, even John O’Connor among them.\r\n\r\nI recall Sunday evenings at the Alamitos when Uncle John got out his\r\nfiddle, and men who had other instruments came into the parlor and we\r\nhad a concert that included _Arkansaw Traveler_, _Money Musk_ and\r\n_Turkey in the Straw_. There had been a piano in the parlor at the San\r\nJusto, but neither Cerritos nor Alamitos boasted piano or organ.\r\n\r\nTo this day the employees on the Alamitos come to the home for\r\nmerry-making at least once a year when the hostess provides a Christmas\r\nparty with a tree and candy and a present for everyone connected with\r\nthe ranch, from the great grandmother of the family down to the last\r\nlittle Mexican or Japanese that lives within its borders.\r\n\r\nAlthough sheep were the earliest interest gradually cattle were added.\r\nInstead of the large herds ranging freely, as they had under Don\r\nTemple and Don Stearns, we kept them in great fenced fields, on both\r\nthe ranches and over on the Palos Verdes. Those were exciting mornings\r\nwhen, at dawn, the men and boys started off for the rodeo, or round-up,\r\non the hills beyond Wilmington, Uncle Jotham and father in the single\r\nbuggy with two strong horses that would take them up and down ravines\r\nand over the hills where no roads were; the boys of the family, and\r\nthe vaqueros, on horseback. I couldn’t go, I was a girl and must be a\r\nlady,--whether I was one or not.\r\n\r\nBut fashions change, and the Alamitos girls today have always been\r\nhorsewomen with their father, and can handle cattle better than most\r\nmen; and then they can lay aside their ranch togs and don a cap and\r\ngown and hold their own in a college, or in filmy dress and silver\r\nshoes, grace a city dance,--competent and attractive daughters of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nAunt Susan, grandmother to these girls, was most hospitable, especially\r\nto children, and Uncle John, with his jokes and merry pranks, a delight\r\nto them. I shall always hear the sound of his voice as he came in the\r\nback door of the hall, danced a sort of clog and called some greeting\r\nto his little wife. He always wore at the ranch boots with high\r\nheels,--cowboy boots.\r\n\r\nOften there would be gathered at the Alamitos, in addition to the\r\nchildren who belonged, half a dozen cousins with their friends, and the\r\nsmall Hellmans, whose father was a part owner in the ranch. The house\r\nwas elastic, and if there were not beds enough there were mattresses\r\nand blankets to make warm places on the floor. The privilege of\r\nsleeping in the impromptu bed was a much coveted one.\r\n\r\nA favorite resort was the great barn, a still familiar sight to\r\npassers-by on the Anaheim Road. It was made from an old government\r\nwarehouse taken down, hauled over from Wilmington and rebuilt at the\r\nranch, forty odd years ago. It afforded magnificent leaps from platform\r\nto hay or long slides on the slippery mows. Up among the rafters\r\nwere grain bins, whose approach over narrow planks added a spice of\r\ndanger--a mis-step would have meant a thirty foot fall, but we never\r\nmade mis-steps. In the central cupola Fred and Nan kept house, while\r\nthe babies were parked in the bins.\r\n\r\n“Old Sorrel,” a friendly mare, lived down in the pasture beyond the\r\nwool-barn, and might be ridden for the catching. She seemed to like\r\nto carry a backful of small people, extending from her mane to her\r\ntail. Fred had a real horse, “Spot,” for riding but “Sorrel” was the\r\nplaymate. Harry had one of those favored horses of old California,\r\ncream-colored with silvery trimmings, and he called him by the general\r\nname of his kind, “Palomino.”\r\n\r\nThere were fish to be caught in New River below Alamitos, catfish and\r\ncarp that could be taken home and eaten. One day Fred and I, wandering\r\nabout, came upon some that had been speared and left by poachers. We\r\nwere indignant, but could do nothing to the men we saw drive away.\r\nHowever, we could prevent the waste of good fish, so we took them to\r\nthe house, neglecting to tell the cook that we had not just killed them\r\nourselves. They could not have been too dead, for no one suffered from\r\neating them.\r\n\r\nKittens and puppies abounded and new chickens, pigs, and calves or\r\ncolts provided constant interest. Once when two insignificant little\r\ndogs were assisted out of the world little Sue took comfort in thinking\r\nthey would look very cute in Heaven tagging around after God every time\r\nHe went for a walk.\r\n\r\nThe son of the house staged one spring a new entertainment. His father\r\ntook great pride in his first litter of twelve thoroughbred Berkshires,\r\nand every day each member of the family inspected the new pigs. One day\r\nthe son of the chief dairyman dared the boy to kill them, which dare\r\nhe immediately accepted, doing the execution with a pitchfork. Then\r\nfollowed a thrashing, weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and no\r\nmore slaughterings!\r\n\r\nI was not involved in this affair, but I cannot claim\r\nblood-guiltlessness. I recall with a shudder my participation in the\r\nstabbing of fat frogs in a shallow pool; even then it sent shivers up\r\nand down my spine, but I could do almost anything the boys could. I\r\ndid draw the line at knocking down swallows nests and feeding the baby\r\nbirds to the cats, although Harry maintained that this was necessary to\r\nprevent the introduction of bed-bugs from the nests into the house. A\r\nyear or two later the boy went out with a new gun that had been given\r\nhim, but came back telling me that he could not shoot turtle doves\r\nwho sat in so friendly a fashion together on the fence rail and made\r\nmournful sounds, neither could he shoot rabbits, for they looked at\r\nhim. He was a sensitive boy and the earlier killings belonged to our\r\nprimitive stage of development.\r\n\r\nIn those days I frequently watched, in spite of mother’s wish that I\r\nshould not, the daily butchering of a sheep, not so much the actual\r\nslaying, but the skinning and the removal of the slippery, interesting\r\ninsides; a daily course in anatomy. And blown-up bladders made\r\nwonderful playthings.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of the Alamitos was the\r\ncheese-making that was done on a large scale, two hundred cows being\r\nmilked for the purpose night and morning. To improve the milk for\r\nthis Uncle John imported some of the first registered Holsteins into\r\nSouthern California. There was great excitement among us children, and\r\nundoubtedly a fair degree of it among the grown-ups, when a carload of\r\nfine animals arrived from New York, prominent among them being several\r\nmembers of the Holstein family of Aaggie, a magnificent bay stallion,\r\nand about a dozen Shetland ponies. For a number of years Mrs. Bixby’s\r\nspan of these harnessed to a tiny buggy were a familiar sight about\r\nLong Beach.\r\n\r\nShe was a skillful driver and I shall never forget a night ride I had\r\nwith her when I was a little girl. I was going home with her from\r\nLos Angeles for a few days at the ranch. We took the train at the\r\nCommercial street station at about five o’clock, and when we reached\r\nWilmington at six it was already dark. We went to the livery stable\r\nwhere the teams had been left for the day, and then set out for the\r\nranch, Uncle John in his gig with Fred, the small boy, tucked in under\r\nthe seat. In the wide, single-seated buggy drawn by two lively horses,\r\nAunt Susan drove, with me between her and the nurse, who held the baby\r\ngirl. The night was so dark and the fog so thick that we could not see\r\nthe horses’ heads, much less the road. We followed close to my uncle,\r\nwho called back every few minutes, and found the way across the bridge\r\nand started along Anaheim Road, not a street lined with houses as it\r\nnow is, but just a track across the bare mesa. It was before the day of\r\nLong Beach.\r\n\r\nSlowly, slowly, we went along, almost feeling our way, blindfolded by\r\nthe mist. There was not a light or a sound, and soon we lost Uncle\r\nJohn, but Aunt Susan did not fail in courage and told us she was going\r\nto give the horses their head and trust them to take us home. Bye and\r\nbye, after two hours they came to a stop and we found we were on the\r\nbrow of the hill, above the wool barn, just a few steps from the house.\r\nIt was relief enough for me to have come home, what must it have been\r\nto the woman driving!\r\n\r\nOne other foggy drive I took many years later. I was fifteen and had\r\nbeen for several days at the Alamitos, among other things drawing the\r\nspots of several new Holstein calves on the blanks of application for\r\nregistration, that being a privilege reserved for me, the wielder of\r\nthe pencil among us. In order to be back in school Monday morning, I\r\nhad to be taken over to Long Beach to meet the first Los Angeles train.\r\nHow many times have I eaten lamp-lit breakfasts in the old ranch dining\r\nroom and started off in the sweet fresh morning, to watch the dawn and\r\nhear the larks sing as we drove!\r\n\r\nThis foggy morning Uncle John was driving and as it was April there was\r\na pearly light over every thing. Every hair of his beard and eyebrows\r\nwas strung with tiny drops of water; we had a most happy hour, drawn by\r\nThunderbolt and Lightfoot. The next day came word of sudden sickness.\r\nIn ten days my merry young uncle was dead. It did not seem possible. It\r\nwas my first realization of death. And childhood ended. When my mother\r\nhad gone I was ten, and while it seemed strange, it did not stand out\r\nfrom all the strangeness of the world as did this later coming face to\r\nface with the mystery. In the case of my mother I missed her more as\r\nyears went by than I did at the time of the actual separation.\r\n\r\nAunt Martha was distressed when after mother’s death she came to us,\r\nto find how often we children played that our dolls had died. We held\r\na funeral service and buried them under the sofa in the parlor after a\r\nsolemn procession through the long hall. We wore towels over our heads\r\nfor mourning veils, copied not from any used in our family, but from\r\nthose of two tall, dark sisters who sat in front of us in church, whose\r\ncrepe-covered dresses and veils that reached the floor were a source of\r\nunfailing wonder.\r\n\r\nAs I look back it does not seem to me that the playing of funerals\r\ninvolved any disrespect or lack of love for our mother, but was,\r\nrather, a transference into our daily activities of a strange\r\nexperience that had come to us.\r\n\r\nWe had another play that was connected with a death, but at the time\r\nI did not recognize the relationship. Just before we came south for\r\nthe long visit, Harry’s five year old sister Margaret had died of\r\ndiphtheria and was buried in the ranch garden. Soon after our arrival\r\na mason came and set up a gravestone for her. Beside her grave were\r\nthose of an older sister, and of a little unnamed baby. The ranch had\r\nbeen robbed of its children and the heart of the young mother sorrowed.\r\nHarry had been devoted to Maggie and was disconsolate without her, so\r\nthat I must have been a most welcome visitor for the lonely small boy.\r\nTaking our cue from the mason we spent many hours in the making of mud\r\ntombstones for our bird and animal burial plot over near the graves\r\nof the children. I modelled them and he polished them and put on the\r\ninscriptions.\r\n\r\nWe wandered about day after day, in the cool summer sunshine,--so near\r\nthe ocean that oppressive heat was rare. As soon as breakfast was\r\nover, away we went. I was clad in a daily clean blue-and-white checked\r\ngingham apron, Harry, although but seven, in long trousers, “like the\r\nmen.” We romped in barn or garden, visited the corrals or gathered the\r\neggs; we played in the old stage left in the weeds outside the fence,\r\nor worked with the tools in the blacksmith shop. When the long tin horn\r\nsounded at noon the call for the men’s dinner we returned to the house\r\nto be scrubbed. I was put into a white apron for meal time, but back\r\ninto my regimentals as soon as it was over. A second whitening occurred\r\nfor supper and lasted until bedtime.\r\n\r\nSometimes we went down to the orchard, where all summer long we could\r\npick ripe apples and pears; and occasionally, as a rare treat, we were\r\nallowed to go barefoot and play in the river, reduced to its summer\r\nsafe level. One day, after having built elaborate sand houses and laid\r\nout rival gardens, planted with bits of every shrub and water weed we\r\ncould find, we went to a place deep enough for us to sit down in water\r\nup to our necks, where, grinning over the top of the water, we enjoyed\r\nan impromptu bath. We hung our clothes on a willow until they were dry\r\nand then wondered what uncanny power made our mothers know that we had\r\nbeen wet.\r\n\r\nA half mile or so beyond this ford lived Uncle Marcellus and Aunt\r\nAdelaide, and their boys, Edward and Herbert, who used to come over\r\nto help at shearing time. Just inside their front door they had a\r\nbarometer shaped like a little house where a woman came out and stood\r\nmost of the time, but if it were going to rain the gallant husband sent\r\nher inside and stood guard himself.\r\n\r\nThe largest and loveliest hyacinths I have ever known grew for this\r\naunt, and she had tame fish in her pond that would come and eat\r\nbreadcrumbs which we gave them. Aunt Adelaide was a very short woman\r\nwith the shiniest, smooth, dark hair that never turned gray. It went in\r\nbig waves down the side of her face. Once she showed mother a number\r\nof large new books and told her about a way to study at home and learn\r\njust as if you were going to college, and a long time afterwards she\r\nshowed us a big piece of paper that she said was a Chautauqua diploma\r\nand meant that she had studied all those books.\r\n\r\nEvery time we went over to the station on the railroad, or came back,\r\nor went to Compton to church or camp meeting, or came back, we always\r\nsaw the old house that had been the first ranch house, belonging to\r\nthe Cotas, but which had now only pigeons, many, many shining lovely\r\npigeons living in it,--and so many fleas that we called it the “Flea\r\nHouse” and knew better than ever to go into it.\r\n\r\nBut we were not afraid to go into the deserted coyote hole that we\r\nfound in a bank down on the side of the hill below the house. Luckily\r\nwe did not find a rattlesnake sharing it with us.\r\n\r\nThe sum of child happiness cannot be told. How good it is to wander\r\nin the sun, smelling wild celery, or the cottonwood leaves, nibbling\r\nyellow, pungent mustard blossoms while pushing through the tangle; how\r\ngood to feel a pulled tule give as the crisp, white end comes up from\r\nthe mud and water, or to bury one’s face in the flowing sulphur well\r\nfor a queer tasting drink, or to cut un-numbered jack-o-lanterns while\r\nsitting high on a great pile of pumpkins of every pretty shape and\r\ncolor, and singing in the salty air; how good to wander in the sun, to\r\nbe young and tireless, to have cousins and ranches!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX FLOCKS AND HERDS\r\n\r\n\r\nSheep were the main interest of the ranches, in fact were the prime\r\nreason for them. I do not know how many there were all told, but on the\r\nCerritos alone there were often as many as thirty thousand head, and\r\nupwards of two hundred thousand pounds of wool were marketed annually\r\nin San Francisco. At first the wool was shipped from Newport Landing,\r\nbut in my day it went from San Pedro.\r\n\r\nThere was little demand for mutton in the south, so from time to time,\r\nin order to dispose of aged surplus stock a band of several thousand\r\nsheep would be driven overland to San Francisco. The start would be\r\nmade in the spring when the grass was green on the hills, so that as\r\nthe stock moved slowly on they found good feed and reached the city\r\nhappy and fat,--to meet their doom.\r\n\r\nIn the early days I understand that Flint, Bixby & Co. imported merino\r\nsheep and materially improved the quality of California wool. I\r\nremember that at the San Justo there was a majestic ram with wool that\r\nhung to the ground, who lived in state in the fine sheep barn with a\r\nfew favored wives. I know that the little girl was warned not to be\r\nfriendly with him as he was not kind and gentle.\r\n\r\nMost of the sheep, however, lived out on the ranges, in bands of about\r\ntwo thousand, under the care of a sheepherder and several dogs. These\r\nmen lived lonely lives, usually seeing no one between the weekly\r\nvisits of the wagon with supplies from the ranch. Many of the men\r\nwere Basques. Often there was some mystery about those who took this\r\nwork,--a life with the sheep was far away from curious observation, and\r\nserved very well for a living grave. Once I overheard talk of a herder\r\nwho had been found dead in his little cabin. He had hanged himself. And\r\nno one knew what tragedy in his life lay behind the fatal despondency!\r\n\r\nOne of the men who had been a cabinet maker made me a set of tiny\r\nfurniture out of cigar box wood, a cradle, table, bureau, book case\r\nand three chairs, all delicately fashioned and showing him to be a\r\nskilled craftsman. I suppose this man so cut off from normal human\r\nrelationships enjoyed the occasional visits of the little girl who rode\r\nabout the ranch with her father.\r\n\r\nEvery week a man from the ranch made the rounds of the sheep camps,\r\ncarrying mail, tobacco, and food,--brown sugar, coffee, flour, bacon,\r\nbeans, potatoes, dried apples. On the morning when this was to happen I\r\nhave watched the flickering light of the lantern travel back and forth\r\nover the ceiling of the room where I was supposed to be asleep, as the\r\nfinishing touches were put on the load, and the horses were brought and\r\nhitched to the wagon before daylight, so that the long rounds could be\r\nmade before night.\r\n\r\nTwice a year, spring and fall, the sheep came up to be sheared, dipped\r\nand counted. Father usually attended to the count himself as he could\r\ndo it without confusion. He would stand by a narrow passage between two\r\ncorrals, and as the sheep went crowding through he would keep tally by\r\ncutting notches in a willow stick.\r\n\r\nDuring shearing time we heard new noises out in the dark at night,\r\nafter we were put to bed, the candle blown out, and the door to the\r\nupper porch opened. Always there were crickets and owls and howling\r\ncoyotes, and overhead the scurrying footsteps of some mouse on its\r\nmysterious business, or the soft dab of an errant bat on the window,\r\nbut now was added the unceasing bleat of thousands of sheep in a\r\nstrange place, and separated, ewe from lamb, lamb from ewe.\r\n\r\nShearing began on Monday morning, and on Sunday the shearers would\r\ncome in, a gay band of Mexicans on their prancing horses, decked with\r\nwonderful, silver-trimmed bridles made of rawhide or braided horsehair,\r\nand saddles with high horns, sweeping stirrups, and wide expanse of\r\nbeautiful tooled leather. The men themselves were dressed in black\r\nbroadcloth, ruffled white shirts, high-heeled boots, and high-crowned,\r\nwide sombreros which were trimmed with silver-braided bands, and held\r\nsecurely in place by a cord under the nose. They would come in, fifty\r\nor sixty strong, stake out their caballos, put away their finery, and\r\nappear in brown overalls, red bandanas on their heads, and live and\r\nwork at the ranch for more than a month, so many were the sheep to be\r\nsheared. They brought their own blankets and camped out. Their meals\r\nwere prepared in a cook wagon.\r\n\r\nOnce at the Alamitos, a number of men had sleeping places in the hay\r\nin the old adobe barn, each holding his chosen bed most jealously from\r\ninvasion. Half a dozen of us children, starting after breakfast on the\r\nday’s adventure, after taking slices from the raw ham stolen from the\r\nsmoke-house and secreted in the hay, spied some clothes carefully hung\r\non the wall above the mow, and the idea of stuffing the clothes into\r\nthe semblance of a man was no sooner born than it was adopted. Our\r\nwhole joy was in doing a life-like piece of work. Fan gave us a paper\r\nbag for the head, which we filled and covered with the hat. Little\r\nwe knew how seriously a hot-tempered Mexican might object to being\r\nfooled. In the evening when the men came into the barn the owner of the\r\nparticular hole in which our dummy was sleeping was furious at finding\r\nhis place occupied. He ordered the stranger out. No move. He swore\r\nviolently. Still no move. He kicked. And as he saw the man come apart\r\nand spill out hay instead of blood, his rage knew no bounds, his knife\r\ncame out, and it was only by good luck that we children were not the\r\ncause of a murder that night. Uncle John made rather vigorous remarks\r\nto us about interfering with the workmen.\r\n\r\nThere were wool-barns at all three of the ranches that I knew, but\r\nI officiated at shearing most often at the Cerritos. Here the barn\r\nwas out beyond the garden, facing away from the house, and toward a\r\nseries of corrals of varying sizes. The front of it was like a covered\r\nveranda, with wide cracks in the floor. Opening from this were two\r\nsmall pens into which a hundred sheep might be turned. The shearer\r\nwould go out among these sheep, feel critically the wool on several,\r\nchoose his victim and drag it backward, holding by one leg while it\r\nhopped on the remaining three to his regular position. Throwing it\r\ndown, he would hold it with his knees, tip its head up, and begin to\r\nclip, clip, until soon its fleece would be lying on the floor, the\r\nanimal would be dismissed with a slap, and the wool gathered up and\r\nplaced on the counter that ran the length of the shearing floor. Here\r\nthe grown boys of the family tied each fleece into a round ball and\r\ntossed it into the long sack that hung in a nearby frame, where a man\r\ntramped it down tight. When the Mexican delivered his wool at the\r\ncounter he was given a copper check, the size and value of a nickel,\r\nmarked J. B., which he presented Saturday afternoon for redemption. It\r\nis a fact that frequently the most rapid workmen did not get the most\r\non pay day, simply because they were less skillful or lucky as gamblers\r\nthan as shearers.\r\n\r\nI remember going one evening out into the garden and peering through a\r\nknot-hole at a most picturesque group of men squatting about a single\r\ncandle on the wool barn floor, playing with odd looking cards, not like\r\nthe ones in the house. The pile of checks was very much in evidence.\r\n\r\nGeorge told me that it was his father’s custom for many years to carry\r\nthe money for the ranch payroll from Los Angeles to Cerritos in a small\r\nvalise under the seat of his buggy, sometimes having several thousand\r\ndollars with him. This habit of his must have been known, but he was\r\nnever molested. George maintained that there was a code of honor among\r\nthe prevalent bandits to respect the old citizens as far as possible.\r\n\r\nI had beautiful days during shearing. Sometimes I was entrusted with\r\nthe tin cup of copper checks and allowed to deal them out in return\r\nfor the fleeces delivered. I spent much time up on this same counter\r\nbraiding the long, hanging bunches of twine that was used for tying up\r\nthe fleeces into balls. I worked until I became expert in braiding any\r\nnumber of strands, either flat or round. A few times I was let climb up\r\nthe frame and down into the suffocating depths of the hanging sacks,\r\nto help tramp the wool, but that was not a coveted privilege,--it was\r\ntoo hot and smelly. I loved to watch the full sack lowered and sewed\r\nup and then to hold the brass stencils while the name of the firm and\r\nthe serial number was painted on it before it was put aside to wait for\r\nthe next load going to Wilmington. Never was there a better place for\r\nrunning and tumbling than the row of long, tight wool sacks in the dark\r\ncorner of the barn.\r\n\r\nMany a check was slipped into our hands, that would promptly change\r\ninto a watermelon, fat and green, or long and striped, for during the\r\nSeptember shearing there was always, just outside the door, a big\r\n“Studebaker” (not an auto in those days) full of melons, sold always,\r\nno matter what the size, for a nickel apiece. It has ruined me\r\npermanently as a shopper for watermelons; nothing makes me feel more\r\nabused by the H. C. L. than to try to separate a grocer and his melon.\r\n\r\nI seem to have gotten far away from my subject, but, really I am\r\nonly standing in the brown mallows outside the open end of the wool\r\nbarn, watching the six horse team start for Wilmington with its load\r\nof precious wool that is to be shipped by steamer to “The City,” San\r\nFrancisco, the one and only of those days.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the shearing was well under way the dipping began. This was\r\nmanaged by the members of the family and the regular men on the ranch.\r\nIn the corral east of the barn was the brick fireplace with the big\r\ntank on top where the “dip” was brewed, scalding tobacco soup, seasoned\r\nwith sulphur, and I do not know what else. This mess was served hot in\r\na long, narrow, sunken tub, with a vertical end near the cauldron, and\r\na sloping, cleated floor at the other. Into this steaming bath each\r\nsheep was thrown; it must swim fifteen or twenty feet to safety, and\r\nduring the passage its head was pushed beneath the surface. How glad it\r\nmust have been when its feet struck bottom at the far end, and it could\r\nscramble out to safety. How it shook itself, and what a taste it must\r\nhave had in its mouth! I am afraid Madam Sheep cherished hard feelings\r\nagainst her universe. She did not know that her over-ruling providence\r\nwas saving her from the miseries of a bad skin disease.\r\n\r\nNow the sheep are all gone, and the shearers and dippers are gone\r\ntoo. The pastoral life gave way to the agricultural, and that in turn\r\nto the town and city. There is Long Beach. Once it was a cattle range,\r\nthen sheep pasture, then, when I first knew it, a barley field with\r\none small house and shed standing about where Pine and First Streets\r\ncross. And the beach was our own private, wonderful beach; we children\r\nfelt that our world was reeling when it was sold. Nobody knows what a\r\nwide, smooth, long beach it was. It was covered near the bluffs with\r\nlilac and yellow sand verbenas, with ice plant and mesembreanthemum\r\nand further out with shells and piles of kelp and a broad band of\r\ntiny clams; there were gulls and many little shore birds, and never a\r\nfootprint except the few we made, only to be washed away by the next\r\ntide. Two or three times a summer we would go over from the ranch for\r\na day, and beautiful days we had, racing on the sand, or going into\r\nthe breakers with father or Uncle Jotham who are now thought of only\r\nas old men, venerable fathers of the city. Ying would put us up a\r\nmost generous lunch, but the thing that was most characteristic and\r\nwhich is remembered best is the meat broiled over the little driftwood\r\nfire. Father always was cook of the mutton chops that were strung on\r\na sharpened willow stick, and I shall never forget the most delicious\r\nmeat ever given me, smoky chops, gritty with the sand blown over them\r\nby the constant sea breeze. I wonder if the chef of the fashionable\r\nHotel Virginia, which occupies the site of our outdoors kitchen,\r\never serves the guests so good a meal as we had on the sand of the\r\nbeautiful, empty beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X EL PUEBLO DE NUESTRA SEÑORA LA REINA DE LOS ANGELES\r\n\r\n\r\nLos Angeles was about ninety years old and I about one when we first\r\nmet, neither of us, I am afraid, taking much notice of the other. For\r\nover twenty years San Francisco had been a city, a most interesting\r\nand alive city, making so much stir in the world that people forgot\r\nthat Los Angeles was the older; that her birth had been ordained by\r\nthe governor and attended with formal rites of the church and salutes\r\nfrom the military way back in 1781, when the famous revolution on the\r\neast coast was just drawing to a successful close. Until the stirring\r\ndays of ’49, San Francisco was insignificance on sand hills. Then her\r\nrise was sudden and glorious and the Queen of the Angels was humble.\r\nBut she was angelic only in name. She was a typical frontier town with\r\nprimitive, flat-roofed dwellings of sun-dried bricks, much like those\r\nbuilt in ancient Assyria or Palestine. Saloons and gambling houses were\r\nout of proportion in number, and there were murders every day. The\r\npresent crime wave is nothing in comparison.\r\n\r\nMy father first saw Los Angeles in January, 1854, when he was camped\r\nwith his sheep on the Rancho San Pasqual; his arrival was a few months\r\nlater than that of Mr. Harris Newmark, who, in his book _Sixty Years\r\nin Southern California_, so vividly describes the village as he found\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBy the time I knew it there had been a great change. There were some\r\nsidewalks, water was piped to the houses, gas had been introduced;\r\nseveral public school buildings had been built; there were three\r\nnewspapers, _The Star_, _The Express_, and _The Herald_. The public\r\nlibrary had been founded,--it occupied rooms in the Downey Block where\r\nthe Federal Building now stands, and Mary Foy, one of Los Angeles’s\r\ndistinguished women, had begun her public service as a young girl in\r\nattendance. Compared with what it had been twenty years before, Los\r\nAngeles was a modern, civilized city; compared with what it is now, it\r\nwas a little frontier town. At school I once learned its population to\r\nbe 11,311.\r\n\r\nWe lived first on Temple Street, near Charity. Once Los Angeles boasted\r\nFaith and Hope Streets as well, but only Hope remains, for Faith has\r\nturned to Flower, and Charity masquerades as Grand.\r\n\r\nNext door to us lived a Jewish family whose girls sat on the front\r\nporch and amazed me by crocheting on Sunday. I had not known that any\r\nJews existed outside the Bible. Perhaps this family was the nucleus for\r\nthe present large colony of Hebrews that now fills the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nTemple Street was new and open for only a few blocks. Bunker Hill\r\nAvenue was the end of the settlement, a row of scattered houses\r\nalong the ridge fringing the sky. Beyond that we looked over empty,\r\ngrassy hills to the mountains. Going down the first hillside and over\r\ntowards Beaudry’s reservoir for a picnic, I once found maidenhair\r\nferns under some brush, and was frightened by what sounded like a\r\nrattlesnake--probably only a cicada. Court Street disappeared in a\r\nhollow at Hope, where a pond was made interesting by a large flock of\r\nwhite ducks.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from us on top of a hill that is now gone, at\r\nthe head of a long flight of wide steps, stood “The Horticultural\r\nPavilion,” destroyed a few years later by fire. It was replaced by\r\nHazard’s Pavilion, an equally barn-like, wooden building on the site\r\nof the present Philharmonic Auditorium. The first Pavilion held county\r\nfairs, conventions, and operas. It was in this place that I once had a\r\ngreat disappointment, for when I was hearing _Pinafore_ a child ahead\r\nof me suddenly coughed and whooped, and I was removed with haste just\r\nat the most entrancing moment. The opera had been put on in London\r\nfirst in the spring of ’78. It had reached Los Angeles by ’79, and we\r\nrevelled in its wit and melody with the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nIt must have been somewhat later than this that the city took such\r\npride in the singing of one of its own girls, Mamie Perry (Mrs.\r\nModini-Wood) who was educated abroad and made her debut in Italy.\r\nAnother name that will recall many a concert and social event to old\r\ntimers is that of Madame Mara.\r\n\r\nIn this building I once saw a strange instrument, a box into which one\r\ncould speak and be heard half a mile away at a similar contraption--a\r\nvery meek and lowly promise of our present telephone system.\r\n\r\nAt this fair, where there were exhibited fruits, jellies and cakes,\r\nquilts and long strings of buttons, when the mania for collecting them\r\nwas at its height, I remember that some ladies, interested in the new\r\nOrphans’ Home, served New England dinners, in a room decked as an old\r\nfashioned kitchen with spinning wheels and strings of corn and drying\r\napples. Among them were my mother and Mrs. Dan Stevens, two slender,\r\ndark-haired young women, wearing colonial costume and high combs--my\r\nmother, who so soon after left this world, and Mrs. Stevens, still\r\namong us, loved and honored for her many good works.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stevens tells me that this was at the time of the visit of\r\nPresident and Mrs. Hayes and a party of government officials, the first\r\npresident of the United States to come to California. All Los Angeles\r\nturned out to welcome them, although there was enough bitter partisan\r\nfeeling left to cause some neighbors of ours to walk past him in line\r\nwhile refusing to shake the hand of the man who they believed usurped\r\nTilden’s rightful place.\r\n\r\nThe celebration began with speaking from a grandstand built in front of\r\nthe Baker Block, followed by a reception given to Mrs. Hayes and the\r\nladies of the party in the parlors of the fashionable St. Elmo Hotel,\r\nstill standing but now fallen to low estate.\r\n\r\nAfter this the presidential party went to the county fair at the\r\npavilion where there was more speaking, a public reception and a formal\r\ndinner. Dr. David Barrows contributes as his memory of this great\r\noccasion--the memory of a small boy who had been brought down from the\r\nOjai Valley--his amazement to observe that Secretary Sherman kept his\r\ncigar in his mouth while making his address. It was during this speech\r\nthat a little boy came forward bringing a great bouquet, the gift of\r\nthe local florist, but suffered so from stage fright that he refused to\r\nmount the platform and my small sister, standing near, was substituted.\r\nShe marched serenely across the stage, delivered the flowers to Mrs.\r\nHayes, was kissed by her, then by the speaker, and final glory, by the\r\nPresident himself. I am sure it was the most lime-lighty moment of\r\nNan’s modest life.\r\n\r\nThis bouquet was not the only gift we afforded our distinguished\r\nvisitor. The other was a cup and saucer, fearfully and wonderfully made\r\nof sectors of red, white and blue cambric, stitched round and round\r\nuntil it was stiff by a little hole-in-the-wall sewing-machine agent.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting our fruits, vegetables, cookery, button strings and\r\nother fancy work the party was entertained at dinner by the leading\r\nwomen of Los Angeles in the improvised New England kitchen at the fair.\r\nThe city council granted them the privilege and appropriated toward\r\nexpense the generous sum of twenty-five dollars, all the council could\r\nafford toward banqueting the most distinguished party that had yet\r\nvisited the City of the Queen of the Angels, so said Mayor Toberman.\r\nBut every grower of fine turkeys or prize fruit or vegetables and every\r\nnotable maker of preserves brought in offerings in kind so that in\r\nspite of the council’s thrift a most generous feast was spread before\r\nour guests.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of politics recalls the wonderful torchlight processions of\r\na later period when I, with my cousins, shouting little Republicans,\r\nperched on the fence at their residence on the corner of Second and\r\nBroadway and delightedly recognized our fathers under the swinging,\r\nsmoky lights.\r\n\r\nI happened to be in Maine during the Blaine-Cleveland campaign and once\r\nrode upon a train to which Mr. Blaine’s special car was attached. It\r\ninterested me to see that when he got out at one station for a hasty\r\ncup of coffee at a lunch counter, he poured the hot liquid into his\r\nsaucer to drink. Was that doing politics, being one of the people,\r\nor was it simply that the mouth of a presidential candidate is as\r\nsusceptible to heat as that of an ordinary mortal? I was much edified,\r\nas I was not accustomed to saucer-drinking. When the train reached\r\nBoston towards midnight, it was met by a most gorgeous torchlight\r\nparade and a blare of music.\r\n\r\nWhen Garfield died, Los Angeles had a memorial service and a long\r\ndaylight procession headed by a “Catafalque,” (a large float,\r\ngruesomely black), on which one of my schoolmates, Laura Chauvin, rode\r\nto represent, I suppose, a mourning angel. Later its black broadcloth\r\ndraperies were used to make souvenirs and sold for some deserving\r\ncause. We purchased a pin-ball the size of a dollar, decorated with a\r\ngreen and white embroidered thistle,--a curious memento of a murdered\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nBut I have been lured by memories of processions as is a small boy by\r\nmartial music, away from my ordered account of where I have lived in\r\nLos Angeles. The second year we moved to the Shepherd house, (so-called\r\nbecause of its owner), where presently my brother, Llewellyn Bixby,\r\njunior, in direct answer to my prayers, came through the ceiling of the\r\nfront bedroom straight into the apron of Mrs. Maitland,--a two-day-late\r\nbirthday present for me. So I was told. My sceptical faculty was\r\ndormant.\r\n\r\nThis house still stands at the top of the precipice made by the cutting\r\nof First Street between Hill and Olive Streets.\r\n\r\nThe lot in front was very steep, with zig-zag paths and terraces, in\r\none of which was a grove of banana trees, where fruit formed, but,\r\nowing to insufficient heat, never ripened well. Do you know the cool\r\nfreshness of the furled, new, pale green leaves? Or how delightful it\r\nis to help the wind shred the old ones into fringe? One by one the red\r\nand gray covers for the circled blossoms drop, and make fetching little\r\nleather caps for playing children.\r\n\r\nIn those days the hill had not been hacked away to make streets, and\r\nwhere now is a great gash to let First Street through there was then a\r\nbreezy, open hill-top, whereon grew brush and wild-flowers. The poppies\r\nin those days were eschscholtzias (the learning to spell the name was\r\na feat of my eighth year), and were not subjected to the ignominy\r\nof being painted with poinsettias on fringed leather souvenirs for\r\ntourists. The yellow violets were gallitas, little roosters, perhaps\r\nbecause in the hands of children they fought to the death, their\r\nnecks hooked together until one or the other was decapitated. The\r\nbrodiæas, or wild hyacinths, sometimes now called “rubbernecks,” were\r\ncalled cacomites, (four syllables), a word of Aztec origin brought to\r\nCalifornia by people from Mexico where it was applied to a different\r\nflower but one having like this one a sweet edible root.\r\n\r\nBetween the weeds and bushes there were bare spots of ground where,\r\nby careful searching, one might find faint circles about the size of\r\na “two-bit” piece. Wise ones knew that these marked the trap doors\r\nof tarantula nests. It was sport to try to pry one open, with mother\r\nspider holding it closed. We young vandals would dig out the nests,\r\ninterested for a moment in the silky lining and the tiny babies and\r\nthen would throw away the wrecked home of the gorgeous black velvet\r\ncreatures that did no harm on the open hill side.\r\n\r\nAt this house Harry and I conducted an extensive “essence factory,”\r\ncollecting old bottles far and near, and filling them with vari-colored\r\nliquids, obtained by soaking or steeping different flowers and leaves.\r\nWe used to drink the brew made from eucalyptus leaves. The pepper\r\ninfusion was pale, like tea; that made from old geraniums was of a\r\nhorrible odor,--hence we liked to inveigle innocent grown folks into\r\nsmelling it. The cactus solution was thick, like castor oil, and we\r\nconsidered it our most valuable product, having arrived thus early\r\nat the notion that difficulty of preparation adds to the cost of a\r\nmanufactured article.\r\n\r\nNorth of us were several houses containing children--and here I found\r\nmy first girl play-mates--Grace and Susie, Bertha and Eileen. The level\r\nstreet at Court and Hill, protected on three sides by grades too steep\r\nfor horses, was our safe neighborhood playground. I never go through\r\nthe tunnel that now has pierced the hill without hearing, above the\r\nroar of the Hollywood car, the patter of flying feet, the rhythms of\r\nthe witch dances, the thud-thud of hop-scotch, the shouting boys and\r\ngirls defending goals in Prisoner’s Base, the old, old song of London\r\nBridge, or the “Intry mintry cutry corn” that determined who was “it”\r\nfor the twilight game of Hide-and-Seek--and then the varied toned bells\r\nin the hands of mothers who called the children home.\r\n\r\nWe played school, jacks, marbles, tag, and an adaption of Peck’s Bad\r\nBoy, and, between whiles, dolls. Even Harry played with them when we\r\nwere still youngsters--say eight or nine. He didn’t seem young to me\r\nthen--he was just himself. I called him “Hab.” My aunt tells of finding\r\nus once about our housekeeping, he doing the doll family washing, and\r\nI papering the house. In our menage there was no sex distinction as to\r\nthe work to be done.\r\n\r\nWe girls, as we grew a little older, had a collection of small dolls,\r\nnone over four inches long, and the various marriages, deaths, and\r\nparties kept us busy. I tailored for the whole group, having apparently\r\na talent for trousers, which early experience undoubtedly encouraged\r\nme in later life to gather in all the stray pantaloons to cut over into\r\nknickerbockers for my numerous boys.\r\n\r\nRaids on the Chinese vegetable wagon provided supplies for our cooking\r\nover a row of small, outdoor fire-places we had built in a low bank\r\nin our yard. Once my mother was much disturbed to find a little pot\r\nof squirrel meat cooking on the stove. She needn’t have worried, for\r\nI knew as well as she that strychnine, slipped into a small piece of\r\nwatermelon rind, transferred its evil potency to the body of the little\r\nbeast that ate it. But it was sport to hang him up as I had seen the\r\nmen do at the ranch when butchering a sheep, to skin him and dress the\r\nmeat, and pretend it was a stew for Isabel, the doll. I had a large\r\ncollection of squirrel skins tacked up on the barn at the Shepherd\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of years we built our own house in the same neighborhood\r\non the south-east corner of Court and Hill Streets. It began as a seven\r\nroom cottage, white with green blinds to suit father. Later the roof\r\nwas raised and a second story inserted and the house painted a more\r\nfashionable all-over gray, to suit the ladies.\r\n\r\nMy mother was a happy woman when, after eleven years of married life,\r\nshe moved into her very own home. A few months later she suddenly died,\r\nleaving my father widowed a second time, a lonely man for the remaining\r\nfourteen years of his life.\r\n\r\nMother had never been a strong woman and was unable to withstand an\r\nattack of typhus fever, contracted when on an errand of kindliness to\r\na sick and forlorn seamstress. I often wish I might have an adult’s\r\nknowledge of mother,--my child memories are beautiful. She was tall and\r\nslender, with quantities of heavy brown hair, dark eyes, and unusual\r\nrichness of color in her cheeks which is repeated in some of her\r\ngrandchildren. It amuses me to recall that I had such absolute faith\r\nin her word that on one occasion when she had visited my school and a\r\ngirl remarked upon what a beautiful mother I had, I stoutly denied the\r\nallegation, for had she not herself assured me that she was not pretty?\r\n\r\nI suppose that her New England conscience and native modesty could not\r\nallow even her little daughter to tell her how lovely she really was.\r\nI am told that she “had a knack of clothes” and I remember some of\r\nthem well enough to confirm the opinion. Her taste allowed beautiful\r\nmaterials and much real lace, but of jewels there were none except some\r\nbrooches that performed useful service and the wedding and engagement\r\nrings that held sentiment.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad thing that just when her dearest wish, that for her own\r\nhome, was fulfilled, she must leave it and her three babies for some\r\none else to care for. Fortunately her dearly loved, next-older sister\r\nwas able to take her place.\r\n\r\nAt the time we built there seemed to be but two styles of architecture\r\nin vogue, one square on a four room base and the other oblong on a six\r\nroom plan, the narrow end being to the street, with one tier of rooms\r\nshoved back a little in order to provide a small porch,--we chose the\r\nlatter. Every such house had a bay window in the projecting end, that\r\nbeing the front parlor, and all windows visible from the street must\r\nhave yellow, varnished inside blinds.\r\n\r\nOne evening while the building was going on we went over as usual for\r\nour daily inspection and noted that the newly set studding marked the\r\ncoming rooms. The connecting parlors seemed small to our eyes and\r\ntastes not yet trained to apartment and bungalow court proportions, so\r\non the following morning father ordered out the wall between proposed\r\nfront and back parlor, and our large sitting room,--living room it\r\nwould be called today, was ordained. It, was unusual in Los Angeles\r\nwhere the prevailing mode demanded the two parlors. This room was large\r\nenough, 18’ x 33’, to stand the height of the ceiling, fourteen feet.\r\nWide, high double-doors opened into the hall, opposite similar ones\r\ninto the reception room, giving a feeling of spaciousness to the house.\r\n\r\nThe furnishing was of necessity more or less that which it is now\r\ncustomary to damn as mid-Victorian,--walnut furniture and a wealth of\r\nvarying design in carpet, curtains, upholstery, wall-paper; but the\r\nwhole in this case was kept in harmony by a key color, a medium olive,\r\nrelieved by soft shades of rose and tan. Even the woodwork was painted\r\nto match the ground color of the walls, instead of glistening in the\r\nusual glory of varnished redwood or yellow pine. Everything was in good\r\ntaste except a fearful and wonderful ceiling that was wished on us by\r\nthe local wall-papering nabob. How fortunate that the walls were so\r\nhigh it was almost out of sight!\r\n\r\nOver our heads were the two plaster of Paris centerpieces from which\r\nlighting fixtures sprang, first hanging lamps with prismatic fringes,\r\nlater gas chandeliers. These fruits and flowers were tinted and gilded.\r\nAround them was a cream colored sky, set with golden stars, small ones,\r\nnot planets,--limited in extent by an oval band of brocaded red velvet,\r\nthis being the pet aversion of Aunt Martha. Outside this pale there was\r\na field of metallic colored paper with an all-over design like chicken\r\nwire; next came a border of flowers and something modest to connect the\r\nwhole artistic creation with the side wall.\r\n\r\nWe had a ceiling, but there were many things characteristic of the\r\nperiod that we did not have. We never had a “throw,” nor a gilded\r\nmilking stool with a ribbon bow on one leg; we never had a landscape\r\npainted on the stem of a palm leaf, nor oranges on a section of orange\r\nwood; we did not hang in any door a portière made of beads, shells,\r\nchenille ropes or eucalyptus seeds, all of which things were abroad in\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe room contained four bookcases, a rosewood square piano, a large\r\ntable, a sofa and several easy chairs. From the walls looked down upon\r\nus Pharoah’s Horses, The Stag in the Glen, and the Drove at the Ford,\r\n(suitable subjects the vogue provided for a family dependent upon\r\nlivestock), but these were not all, for there were a few reproductions\r\nof old masters, a fine portrait of grandfather in his youth, and\r\na picture of the sweet-faced mother who had gone to Heaven, as we\r\nchildren said.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the room was a white marble mantel with a large grate,\r\nalways annoying us by its white patchiness in the low toned room, but\r\ncontributing cheer with the coal fire that, through more than half the\r\nyear, burned all day long. Los Angeles had no furnaces in those days,\r\nbut the family was suited by the single fireplace, for one could choose\r\nthe climate he wished from torrid zone near the grate to arctic in the\r\nbay window, where the goldfish circled their watery globe.\r\n\r\nThe room was the center of a happy family life, where, of an evening,\r\nall read by the light of the student lamp, or indulged in games,\r\ndominoes, authors, crambo, or logomachy, sugar-coated ways of getting\r\ntraining respectively in addition, names of books and writers,\r\nverse-making and spelling. Father rarely went out, and after the\r\nreading of his evening paper might join a lively domino tournament or\r\namuse himself with solitaire.\r\n\r\nUntil the very last years of his life he busied himself at odd jobs\r\nabout the house. Sometimes it would be a session with the grandfather\r\nclock, sometimes it would be chopping wood. He had the willow brought\r\nup from the ranch in long pieces, which he cut and stacked under the\r\nhouse. He raised chickens and at first cared for a horse and cow. Later\r\nwe kept two horses, dispensed with the cow, and had a man for the\r\nlivestock and garden and to drive us about town. We did not have a dog\r\nregularly but always cats, classical cats. Æneas was very long-legged\r\nand Dido lived with us a long time. I think it was she who went every\r\nevening with father for his after dinner walk and cigar.\r\n\r\nOne Thanksgiving time the wagon from the ranch came, bringing us a\r\ncouple of barrels of apples, a load of wood and a fine turkey for the\r\nfeast day. Imagine our dismay, one afternoon, to see it mount up on its\r\nwings and soar majestically from our hill top back-yard down to the\r\ncorner of First and Broadway below. He escaped us but, I presume, to\r\nsome one else he came as a direct answer to prayer.\r\n\r\nFather was always interested in flowers and was very successful in\r\nmaking them grow. Usually there was a box of slips out in the back\r\nyard. Often he would bring in a rich red Ragged Robin bud, dew-wet, to\r\nlay by mother’s napkin for breakfast. For himself he put a sprig of\r\nlemon-verbena in his button-hole. For some reason, he excepted orange\r\ncolored flowers from his favor. He made mock of the gay little runners\r\nby twisting their name into “nasty-urchins.”\r\n\r\nThe windows of my room, directly over the parlor, were covered with a\r\nlarge, climbing “Baltimore Belle,” an old-fashioned small cluster rose\r\nthat I never see now-a-days. From my side window I looked out on a long\r\nrow of blue-blossomed agapanthus, interspersed with pink belladonnas,\r\nflowers that in summer repeated the blue of the mountains touched at\r\nsunset with pink lights.\r\n\r\nEvery night when ready for bed, I opened the inside blinds and looked\r\nat the mountains and up to the stars and enlarged my heart, for what\r\ncan give one the sense of awe and beauty that the night sky does?\r\n\r\nThe location of our home on the brow of a hill was chosen because\r\nof the view and the sense of air and space. Below us was the little\r\ncity, the few business blocks, the homes set in gardens on tree shaded\r\nstreets, the whole surrounded by orchards and vineyards. On clear days\r\nwe could see the mountains far in the east and the ocean at San Pedro,\r\nwith Santa Catalina beyond.\r\n\r\nOne very rainy winter, possibly ’86, we watched the flood waters from\r\nthe river creep up Aliso Street and into Alameda: we saw bridges go out\r\nand small houses float down stream. Then it was that Martin Aguierre, a\r\nyoung policeman, won the admiration of everyone when he rode his black\r\nhorse into the torrent and rescued flood victims from floating houses\r\nand debris in mid-stream. One of the girls in my room at school lost\r\nall her clothing except what she wore, and we had a “drive” for our\r\nlocal flood-sufferer.\r\n\r\nThis was a very different river in summer. I once saw a woman whose\r\nnerves had been wracked by dangerous winter fordings when the water\r\nswirled about the body of the buggy, get out of her carriage, letting\r\nit ford the Los Angeles river while she stepped easily across the\r\nentire stream. She had a complex, but she didn’t know that name for her\r\nfear!\r\n\r\nBeyond the river and up the hill on the other side stood, stark\r\nand lonely, the “Poor House,” the first unit of the present County\r\nHospital. Many a time when the skies forbore to rain I had it pointed\r\nout to me as my probable ultimate destination; for, after the bad\r\nmiddle years of the seventies when to a general financial depression\r\nwas added a pestilence that killed off all the lambs, and to that was\r\nadded a disastrous investment in mines, the firm of Flint, Bixby & Co.\r\nwas sadly shaken, and it was of great moment whether or not sufficient\r\nmoisture should come to provide grass and grain for the stock. So, if\r\nthe sun shone too constantly and the year wore on to Christmas without\r\na storm the ominous words, “a dry year,” were heard and the bare\r\nbuilding across the river loomed menacingly. But it always rained in\r\ntime to save us!\r\n\r\nRain and overflowing rivers connote mud. Walkers on the cement\r\nsidewalks beside our paved streets little realize what wonderful mud\r\nwas lost when Progress covered our adobe. With its first wetting it\r\nbecame very slippery on top of a hard base, but as more water fell and\r\nit was kneaded by feet and wheels, it became first like well-chewed\r\ngum and then a black porridge. I have seen signs that warned against\r\ndrowning in the bog in the business center of town. An inverted pair\r\nof boots sticking out of a pile of mud in front of the old Court House\r\nonce suggested that a citizen had gone in head first and disappeared.\r\n\r\nSmall boys turned an honest nickel or two by providing plank\r\nfoot-bridges or selling individual “crickets” which the wayfarer might\r\ntake with him from corner to corner. As the sun came out and the mud\r\nthickened the streets became like monstrous strips of sticky fly\r\npaper. We walked the cobblestone gutters until our rubbers were in\r\nshreds, or, when necessity drove us into the gum, lost them.\r\n\r\nA friend assures me that one Sunday morning she set out for a church\r\nnear the center of the city, that she made slow progress for a block\r\nand a half, and then, realizing that so much time had passed that she\r\ncould not arrive in time for service, turned around and went home. It\r\nhad taken her an hour and a half to make the round trip amounting to\r\nthree blocks.\r\n\r\nThere is no mud so powerful when it is in its prime as adobe, and when\r\nit dries in all its trampled ridges and hollows, it is as hard as a\r\nrock. It takes all summer to wear it down level, ready to begin over\r\nagain with the new rains. There are a few places yet, where, some rainy\r\nday if you are feeling extra fit, you may try a stroll across a Los\r\nAngeles street and learn to sympathize with a captured fly.\r\n\r\nCertain other interesting kinds of soil are also covered up in Los\r\nAngeles. On the southwest corner of Temple and Broadway there is mica\r\ncropping out between the strata, and up by Court Street Angel’s Flight\r\nthere is a nice white formation very like chalk. I liked to cut it into\r\nodd shapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI MORE ABOUT LOS ANGELES\r\n\r\n\r\nI am still a person somewhat young and lively who has had the strange\r\nexperience of seeing barley fields sprout houses like the magic\r\nsoldiers from the sowing of dragon’s teeth; of finding cactus and\r\ngravel and sage turned over night into leagues of orange trees; of\r\nwatching my little city multiply itself a hundred fold. What wonder\r\nthat I cannot forbear to talk about it! to tell of how once upon a time\r\nthe street of sky-scrapers was a shaded way before a few rose-covered\r\ncottages, or how the hills of Hollywood were bare brown velvet beyond\r\nthe vacant fields that lay west of Los Angeles’ Figueroa Street, itself\r\nunfinished. When we looked over the town from our home on the Court\r\nStreet hill we saw a place of trees and cottages, of open spaces and\r\nencircling groves. Only to our left were business houses, and they\r\nneither high nor imposing. On Poundcake Hill, where now the County\r\nCourt House rises, was the square, two-storied high school building,\r\nwhich a few years later crossed Temple Street on stilts, and went over\r\nto its new abiding place on California Street.\r\n\r\nJust below us was the old jail, enclosed by its high white fence which\r\nmay have shut in prisoners and shut out the curious who approached on\r\nFranklin Street, but whose secrets were wide open to the sky. Once our\r\nwhole back yard and the top of our chicken house and barn were black\r\nwith men strangely eager to look down upon a fellow man whom we, the\r\npublic, were hanging high upon a gallows within that old stockade. We\r\nchildren were shut in the house and did not see, but the next day my\r\nsmall brother and another tiny boy were found trying to hang each other.\r\n\r\nThe jail was in the rear of the city buildings, a row of low adobes\r\non Spring Street, opposite the old court house, the one built by John\r\nTemple. Nearby, the post-office occupied the first floor of the new I.\r\nO. O. F. building, a little too far south to be sure,--nearly to First\r\nStreet,--but perhaps the spaciousness and freshness compensated for its\r\ndistance from the business center to the north. Across the way from it\r\nthere stood a small white cottage, with a hedge of cypress and a lawn.\r\nMy first school was around the corner in a similar white house, and on\r\nmy way home I was permitted to stop and get our mail from our box at\r\nthe post-office.\r\n\r\nThe shopping district ran from this “civic center” up to the plaza, the\r\nvery region that is now being retrieved for the heart of the public\r\nlife of Los Angeles city and county.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I discovered, stranded high on the front wall of an old\r\nbrick building, the abandoned sign of “The Queen,” the store from which\r\ncame my “pebble-goat” school shoes, the store itself long ago having\r\nfollowed the shoes “to the bone yard.”\r\n\r\nIn Temple Block were many offices, but I remember it as the abode of\r\nGodfrey, the photographer, who, plentifully supplied with red velvet\r\nfringed chairs and pronged head braces, took the pictures of the\r\nAngelenos.\r\n\r\nOver in the Downey Block, where now the U. S. Government Building\r\nstands, and in the buildings to the north, were some of our most\r\nfrequented stores, among them Meyberg’s Crystal Palace, a source of\r\nchina and glassware, and Dotter and Bradley, whose furniture firm later\r\ntook the name of Los Angeles Furniture Co. A little Barker store was\r\nborn over near First and Spring, but that was so far from the center of\r\nthings, and chilly and lonely, that it moved nearer to the Plaza,--and\r\nnow Barker Brothers aspires to be the largest furniture “emporium” in\r\nthe world with a palace on Seventh Street!\r\n\r\nI knew something of Commercial and Los Angeles streets as business\r\nthoroughfares, but their importance was passing, and the new Baker\r\nBlock was the last word in elegance, and the pride of all the dwellers\r\nin Los Angeles. Here Rev. B. F. Coulter opened a drygoods store that\r\ncontinues to this day in the fourth location that I remember, moving\r\nfirst to Second and Spring, then following the fashion up to Broadway\r\nand later going to Seventh. Then as now this establishment specialized\r\nin blankets, perhaps because Mr. Coulter had a woolen mill over the\r\nhill where now is the corner of Figueroa and Fifth streets. There was a\r\nlittle stream there that was called Los Reyes,--the Kings,--rather a\r\nhumble place for royalty in a city of the Queen of the Angels.\r\n\r\nTwo favorite shops of that time have disappeared, that of Dillon\r\nand Kennealy, who carried a line of most lovely linens from their\r\nIrish homeland, and the City of Paris, “the best place for lace and\r\ntrimmings,” I used to hear. That was before the time of ready-made\r\nclothing, and real ladies were most particular about the quality of\r\nmaterials used and the nicety of workmanship.\r\n\r\nOne day a small new store, with a fifty foot frontage, appeared at\r\nthe corner of Temple and Spring. Good shoppers soon recognized high\r\ngrade materials and efficient salesmanship, and the firm had to move a\r\nfew doors south to obtain larger space, and then, made bold by public\r\nfavor, it went pioneering way out among the residences on Broadway\r\nnear Third, to remain a few years until it set the fashion of Seventh\r\nstreet,--J. W. Robinson & Co.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ponet supplied the ladies with bonnets, when Miss Daley didn’t,\r\nand Mr. Ponet framed our pictures and buried our dead.\r\n\r\nAs I was only a little girl in those days, I do not know so much about\r\nthe shopping habits of the gentlemen, but I remember that they bought\r\nhats from D. Desmond, cutlery from C. Ducommun and watches and jewels\r\nfrom S. Nordlinger.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I picked up an old map of Los Angeles showing a new\r\nsubdivision just west of Figueroa. The map was issued by Stoll and\r\nThayer, who with Hellman, Stassforth Co., were the chief purveyors\r\nof school books, slates, Christmas cards with silk fringe, lace\r\npaper valentines and other necessities. Here I bought those classics,\r\nMcGuffy’s Fourth Reader, Robinson’s Arithmetic, Harper’s Geography, and\r\nCollier and Daniel’s Latin Book.\r\n\r\nFor years it was necessary for anyone desiring a book other than those\r\nstandard works known to druggists and stationers to send away for it,\r\nso it was a great thing for lovers of literature when Mr. C. C. Parker\r\ncame to town and opened a book shop for books only,--no twine or glue\r\nor notebooks or cosmetics or toys, not even text books admitted to his\r\nshelves.\r\n\r\nOver east of the shopping district lay Chinatown, at one time a very\r\ninteresting and picturesque part of Los Angeles, having at least\r\n7,000 inhabitants, but owing to the Exclusion Act of the nineties now\r\ndwindled to 2,000. With its going has come a distinct loss in color, to\r\nsay nothing of the much regretted race of competent and loyal household\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nThere used to be three joss houses, or Chinese temples, and a theatre\r\nwith a large troupe of players, including a lady star, a rarity, as\r\nusually all the actors are men. There was weird music to be heard,\r\nthere were feasts and fortune tellers and funerals where the chief\r\nfigure was rushed at break-neck speed to the cemetery, followed by a\r\nspring wagon load of food while loyal friends scattered bits of paper\r\nto distract the attention of the devil in his pursuit of the newly dead.\r\n\r\nBut the life was not all picturesque. There were slave women and tong\r\nwars and murders and individual persecutions of Chinese by low grade\r\nwhites, and ever the haunting memory of the massacre of 1871 when\r\nnineteen Chinese lost their lives at the hands of a mob.\r\n\r\nThe changing of prestige of hotels has marked the changing city. Just\r\nnow the Biltmore holds the center of the stage, last year it was the\r\nAmbassador, once it was the Bella Union, perhaps the most interesting\r\nof them all, dating as it did, back into pueblo days. The Pico House\r\nof the early seventies prided itself on rivalling the San Francisco\r\nhostelries, but before a decade had passed it had to yield first place\r\nto the St. Elmo, the place chosen in which to do honor to Mrs. Hayes,\r\nthe wife of the President. I have personal memories of both the Pico\r\nand the St. Elmo. In the first we once stayed several days during one\r\nof my earliest trips to Los Angeles, and in the second I climbed the\r\nred velveted stairs, holding my mother’s hand to greet the chief lady\r\nof the land. The poor old place is now a ten cent lodging house, just\r\nnorth of the post office.\r\n\r\nWhen the Nadeau, towering four stories and containing all the latest\r\nwrinkles, was completed it easily assumed first place, but in such\r\na bustling, booming town it soon had to pass the favor on to the\r\nHollenbeck; then came the Westminster and the Van Nuys, which I believe\r\nstill clings to a little back-water distinction.\r\n\r\nThe sudden end of the boom about eighty-seven had one very excellent\r\nresult, it saved us the chagrin of having our finest caravanserie\r\ncalled Hotel Splendid--it never got beyond the foundations, out at\r\nTenth and Main. Perhaps the name was no worse than San Francisco’s\r\nPalace which has built about itself such a tradition that no one stops\r\nto consider the self-assumption of its designation.\r\n\r\nDuring those boom years Los Angeles was having its first experience\r\nof rapid growth, and we were almost as proud and boastful then as we\r\nare now,--at least in quality if not in quantity. It seemed just as\r\nexciting to suddenly grow from ten to fifty thousand, as it does to\r\naim at a million or two. We hadn’t invented the name realtor for our\r\nland sellers or established courses at college in realtoring, but there\r\nwere already enterprising boosters. One of them displayed in his office\r\nwindow this hospitable biblical text: “I was a stranger and ye took me\r\nin.”\r\n\r\nIt was during that period that we boldly discarded gas as a means of\r\nlighting our streets and adopted electricity, the first city in the\r\nland to do it. How imposing were our six tall poles each carrying four\r\narc lights, four substitute moons, protected by a little tin umbrella.\r\nWhat strange and beautiful blue light filtered through our windows,\r\nmaking on the walls black shadows of the swaying eucalyptus branches\r\nlike Japanese silhouettes.\r\n\r\nThe summer that we first had these wonder lanterns the very sky put\r\non a nightly pageant of color, most gorgeous sunsets to celebrate our\r\nprogress, and incidentally to mark the fact that the upper air was full\r\nof a fine ash from a volcanic eruption in far away Java.\r\n\r\nI wonder what we could do now if the railroads should start another\r\nrate war as they did when the Santa Fe first came into Southern\r\nCalifornia. Tickets from the middle west dropped to five dollars, and\r\non one day went down to one. We would need a host of Aladdins with\r\nobedient genii to build in a minute not palaces but just plain houses\r\nand schools,--the fact is that one or two such magic builders would not\r\nat all be despised by our present boards of education.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of stores and public buildings and hotels and real-estate\r\noffices but they were not all that the streets afforded; there was a\r\nbarber shop where father and I got our respective hairs cut, accepting\r\nthe fragrant offering of bay rum, supposed to ward off head colds\r\ndue to the exposure of lightening one’s head covering, but refusing\r\nemphatically the hair oil in the pink, brass-nozzled bottle. Then there\r\nwas the fruit stand next to Wollacott’s Wholesale Liquor Establishment\r\nnear the post office where we bought the ceremonial bananas that\r\ncompleted the barbering, bananas at five cents apiece. If none could\r\nbe found a like amount was invested in sugary peppermint drops. These\r\ndelicacies were eaten at the little Wells Fargo office on the east side\r\nof Temple block where there was time enough and little enough doing for\r\nMr. Pridham and father to tilt back their round chairs and have a good\r\ngossip.\r\n\r\nOne day we went over to investigate the crowd that had gathered on the\r\ncovered sidewalk in front of the Baker Block on North Main Street.\r\nSuddenly a man came balancing across the tight rope that was stretched\r\nabove us. I saw him stop there over our open-mouthed heads and flip a\r\nflap-jack in the pan he carried. I do not know why he thus showed his\r\nprowess nor what his reward, but he furnished a passing entertainment\r\nfor the inhabitants of Los Angeles back in the later seventies, and his\r\nghost still walks in mid-air for me whenever I go through that old part\r\nof town.\r\n\r\nHis is not the only walking spirit. There in the Plaza still stands\r\nthe shade of the peripatetic dentist, fore-runner of Painless Parker,\r\nwho once stood for several days in a red and gold chariot containing a\r\ngorgeous, throne-like chair; for a consideration he pulled teeth of any\r\nwho were in search of relief.\r\n\r\nStill a third ghost walks and calls in unforgotten accents, “Ice\r\nCream,” the white-clad Mexican who went about the town with a freezer\r\non his head, and in his hand a circular tin carrier, with a place for\r\nspoons in the middle and holes for the six tumblers in which he served\r\nhis wares. There was a great scurrying for nickels among the children\r\nwhen his cry was heard in the land.\r\n\r\nIn those days two street car lines meandered, the one way out to\r\nAgricultural Park (Exposition), a large bare space with a few old\r\neucalyptus trees, and the grand stand beside the race-track; the other\r\nsouth on Spring to Sixth and then up to Pearl, the name of Figueroa\r\nstreet, north of Pico where the bend is. Each line boasted two cars so\r\nthat simultaneous trips in opposite directions were possible. The cars\r\nwere very small and drawn by mules; there was no separate conductor;\r\nwe put our tickets--bought at the neighboring drug store--into a glass\r\nbox near the door. It is told that on the Main street line it was the\r\ncustom for the driver on late trips to stop the car, wind the reins\r\naround the brake handles, and escort lone lady passengers to their\r\nfront doors,--so much for leisure and gallantry in old Los Angeles.\r\nEven as late as 1890 the car once waited while a lady ran into Mott’s\r\nmarket for her meat!\r\n\r\nSometimes we took the car for Sixth and Pearl and then walked on down\r\nto Twelfth, where Aunt Margaret lived for a time. The street was a\r\ngrass-bordered road and along the west side the footpath followed a\r\nzanja (a ditch for water). Mr. H. K. W. Bent, the postmaster, and a\r\nman who was in every way a value to the community, had an orange grove\r\nhere and lived in it. As I passed it I would meditate, not on his\r\nhigh position, (he was my Sunday School superintendent), but on the\r\nstrange thing I had heard about him. He ate pie for breakfast! That\r\nwas undoubtedly a taste brought straight from New England. We happened\r\nto import a different one; we had doughnuts twice a day every day in\r\nthe year. His taste, being different, was queer. I guess each family\r\nhad beans and brown bread at least once a week, with frequent meals of\r\nboiled codfish, attended by white sauce and pork scraps.\r\n\r\nThe trip on the other line was out past vineyards, an occasional\r\nhouse, one of them being the adobe mistakenly called the headquarters\r\nof General Fremont, far, far away to the race-track, to see our\r\nSilverheel trot.\r\n\r\nBut we did not go often, and then only as a concession to the fathers,\r\nfor races were frowned upon by mothers as being unsuitable for\r\nChristians and girls.\r\n\r\nThe circus, however, was not under the ban, and “joy was unconfined”\r\nwhen we heard the shrill calliope in the streets and saw the line\r\nof elephants and caged lions and gay horsewomen filing along Spring\r\nStreet. There were usually enough children in the family to provide\r\nexcuses for all the men-folk who longed to attend the show as\r\nchaperones. Grandfather felt that seventy years of abstinence justified\r\nhim in examining a circus thoroughly and Harry was his lucky escort,\r\nwhen, with his inhibitions released, he visited everything, even to the\r\nlast side-show.\r\n\r\nAfter a full fledged Barnum and Bailey the small tent on the lot now\r\ngraced by the Times building where trained horses and dogs performed\r\nfor a month was too tame for the gentlemen, but afforded pleasure to\r\nthe children.\r\n\r\nOnce Los Angeles was small enough to be very happy during county fair\r\nweek, with its races and shows of fine stock and the usual indoor\r\nexhibits of fruits and grains, its fancy work and jellies, and then the\r\nfair developed into orange shows and flower festivals and finally into\r\nthe fiesta. We lined the streets with palms and decked the buildings\r\nwith the orange, red and green banners and played and paraded for a\r\nweek in April, the peak of Spring. We saw our redshirted firemen\r\nwith their flower-garlanded, shining engines, drawn by those wisest\r\nof animals, the fire horses; bands played, Spanish cavaliers and\r\nseñoritas appeared again in our midst, marvellous floats vied for first\r\nprize--gay days.\r\n\r\nWho that saw the many-footed dragon that wound its silken, glistening\r\nway out of Chinatown into our streets can ever forget its beauty. Or\r\nthe floats that carried the bewitching little Chinese children wearing\r\ntheir vivid embroidered garments and beaded headdresses? Alas, they are\r\nburied now in their American coveralls and corduroys.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to us? Did we grow too unwieldy, or too sophisticated or\r\nwere we swamped with midwest sobriety? We gave our parade to Pasadena,\r\nwho put it in wintry January instead of fragrant, flowering April; San\r\nBernardino has the orange show, fiesta has disappeared altogether. But\r\nI have heard whispers that indicate that mayhap the spirit of pageantry\r\nand frolic is about to return to Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nMany changes have come but each phase as it exists seems the natural\r\ncondition; the old days that I have been recalling were the “Now” that\r\nwe knew. In the past there was less hurry and more room in our streets\r\nthat were built to be but ways between cottage homes where now and\r\nthen a wagon or carriage might go. However, there were no more hours a\r\nday to fill or dispose of than we have now. We could stroll down the\r\nstreet to do our errands, meeting friends at every turn; we could drive\r\nif preferred, and although Harry Horse and the phaeton made slower\r\nprogress than Henry Ford or Lionel Limousin, he did not have so far\r\nto go and he could stand as long as he wished before the shop door, so\r\nthat the time consumed by my lady was no more than in these days of\r\nsuburban homes, and parking places far, far from where she really wants\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nIn the matters of health, friendship, intelligence, the number of\r\ninhabitants in a city are of little moment; happiness does not increase\r\nwith population.\r\n\r\nI find it interesting, however, to have in my mind pictures of the\r\nlittle vanished village that once was Los Angeles. I also find it\r\ninteresting to watch its present turmoil and energy and to speculate on\r\nits future; to see signs of intellectual, artistic and social vitality\r\nthat exist among the scattered groups and individuals now pouring into\r\nthis seething community; to wonder how soon the wheels of progress are\r\ngoing to stop rattling long enough for us to hear ourselves think,\r\ncatch our breath and develop some sort of cohesive social organism.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion just now to make a butt of Los Angeles, to see\r\nonly its obsessions, its crudities, its banalities. Those who really\r\ncomprehend the amazing number of people daily crowding in upon us,\r\nand remember that the bulk of the people are inevitably strangers to\r\neach other, each ready to shift responsibility to someone supposedly\r\nan older citizen, cannot but have patience, cannot but rejoice in the\r\nreally fine things that have been done and are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII THE BACK COUNTRY AND THE ADMIRAL\r\n\r\n\r\nFor seventy years after its founding in 1781 Los Angeles was the only\r\npueblo, as distinguished from presidio or mission, in the southern part\r\nof this state; and until the sudden growth of San Francisco during the\r\ngold excitement, it was the largest city in California, boasting about\r\ntwenty-five hundred inhabitants when it came under American rule. Of\r\nthe three neighboring missions, San Gabriel and San Juan Capistrano\r\nantedate Los Angeles by a few years, while San Fernando was founded\r\nabout twelve years later.\r\n\r\nDuring the Spanish and Mexican regimes California’s population was\r\nlargely scattered upon the ranchos, and this condition remained for\r\nnearly a generation after the settlement of the northern counties.\r\nThe story of the life in this grazing land is familiar,--the story of\r\nits leisureliness and hospitality; of its life on horseback, of the\r\ngreat herds of black, lean, long-horned cattle, the offspring of the\r\nfew animals brought in by the padres; of the devotion of the founders\r\nof the missions, of their prosperity and then of their decline under\r\nthe secularization of the Mexican law. Even as late as the time of my\r\nchildhood the country was still very empty and Los Angeles was a little\r\ncity set in gardens and orchards, a narrow border of cultivated lands\r\nseparating it from the wide, almost treeless, valley.\r\n\r\nAn exception to this general condition was the district to the East,\r\ncentering about the San Gabriel; this mission early won the title\r\nQueen of the Missions, not because of the size or beauty of church or\r\nlocation, but because of the large number of Indians under its care,\r\nand the extent of its herds, orchards, vineyards and grainfields.\r\nIts cattle, estimated variously from 75,000 to a 100,000, roamed the\r\ngreat valley even to the foot of the mountains San Gorgonio and San\r\nJacinto; for convenience in administration a branch, or asistencia, was\r\nestablished at San Bernardino in 1810.\r\n\r\nThe San Gabriel vineyard numbered a hundred and fifty thousand vines,\r\nfrom cuttings brought from Spain, and the making of wine and brandy\r\n(aguadiente) became an important industry. Its orchards, at their peak,\r\ncontained over twenty-three hundred trees, most of them oranges, which\r\nthe padres introduced, together with olives, pomegranates, and lemons.\r\nThe gardens were surrounded with adobe walls or cactus hedges as a\r\nprotection against marauding cattle or people, who, as one padre once\r\nquaintly said, “put out the hand too often.”\r\n\r\nThe first San Gabriel oranges were planted in 1804 by Padre Tomas\r\nSanchez. Thirty years afterward the earliest grove in Los Angeles was\r\nset out by Don Luis Vignes, to be followed in 1841 by that of William\r\nWolfskill, whose orchard later became famous as the largest in the\r\nUnited States. He was instrumental in bringing in many new plants to\r\nthis country, and the beauty of his home place was great. His gardens\r\ngave way for the Southern Pacific Arcade Station, his orchard ground\r\nis covered by the city’s business, and no one thinks of Los Angeles as\r\nonce the actual center of California’s orange growing industry.\r\n\r\nAnd as these groves have been supplanted by the houses of trade, the\r\nMission’s orchards have been transformed into homes. But when I was a\r\nlittle girl they still remained, had even been extended by those who\r\ncame into possession after the secularization of San Gabriel.\r\n\r\nMany of the names now familiar around Pasadena were the names of these\r\nestates. For instance, San Marino and Oak Knoll were the properties of\r\nDon Benito (Benjamin) Wilson, and his son-in-law, J. De Barth Shorb.\r\nDon Wilson was one of those Americans who came here during the Mexican\r\nrule, married into an old California family, and became identified with\r\nthe land. It is for him that the astronomical peak is named, because\r\nit was he who at the expense of much money and labor built the trail\r\nto the top of the ridge. He had hopes of finding timber suitable for\r\nmaking of casks for his wine, but although he failed in this there was\r\nsome lumber brought down on burro back.\r\n\r\nAnother familiar name is El Molino, the old mill which the mission\r\nbuilt. It fell into disrepair, but was rescued by Col. Kewen, who made\r\nof it a charming home, while developing an estate about it. The story\r\nof Mrs. Kewen’s five hundred callas for an Easter at the Episcopal\r\nChurch has come down. Callas were in better repute then than now.\r\n\r\nMrs. Albert Sidney Johnson called her new home in California Fair Oaks,\r\nthe name of her Virginian birthplace. Los Robles (The Oaks), was the\r\nhome of Governor Stoneman.\r\n\r\nOld timers will recall the estate of L. J. Rose, Sunny Slope, famous\r\nboth for its wines and brandies and for its stables of fine horses.\r\nMajor Truman in his book, _Semi-tropic California_, dating from 1874,\r\nspeaks of this district as a “fruit belt, two miles wide and ten miles\r\nlong,” and calls it the California Lombardy.\r\n\r\nIt was just next door to this region of wine and brandy that the\r\ntemperance people from Indiana started their colony on a portion of the\r\nold San Pasqual grant, the ranch where Flint, Bixby & Co. had pastured\r\ntheir sheep after the desert crossing in 1854. This colony devoted\r\nitself to oranges, not so intoxicating as grapes, and gave the name of\r\nthe chief industry to the fashionable avenue. After a time they began\r\nto call themselves Pasadena, an imported name, and after a little more\r\ntime we in Los Angeles began to know about the new settlement which was\r\ngetting big enough to maintain a modest daily stage to the city,--a\r\nspring wagon. The road followed much the same route as is used today,\r\ndown across the unbridged Arroyo Seco and over the flowery field that\r\nlater became Garvanza, a field filled in spring with great masses of\r\nwild blossoms, poppies, and lupine, larkspur, tidy-tips, and pink\r\nowl-clover,--pink tassels we children called them; past the Sycamores,\r\nthe popular country beer-garden, through the little settlement known as\r\nEast Los Angeles, along Buena Vista street (North Broadway), so called\r\nbecause of its attractive outlook across the early gardens and orchards\r\nof Los Angeles, and on into the Plaza. The earliest name for this\r\nstreet was Calle de Eternidad--Eternity Street--because it was the road\r\nto the cemetery.\r\n\r\nOne of the places reached by this road was the hill near the point\r\non the brink of the Arroyo where ostriches now congregate, which was\r\na favorite place for the city picnickers,--far away when measured by\r\nhay-wagon speed and untouched by any “improvements.” It was there one\r\nspring day that my schoolmates and I, of that grade which studies\r\nAmerican colonial history, acted out a recent lesson, “storming the\r\nheights of Abraham” up the steep hillside, pushing our way under the\r\noaks, through brush, past great clumps of maiden-hair fern to the mesa\r\natop where we found a million seeming butterflies, the mariposa lilies,\r\nhovering over the grass.\r\n\r\nWhile Pasadena was growing up to the west of the old district, “Lucky”\r\nBaldwin was developing on the east that loveliest of all oak-clad\r\nranches, the Santa Anita, and making of it a show place sought by the\r\nfew hardy and intrepid tourists who were beginning to find their way\r\ninto Southern California, making a name for it far and wide not only\r\nbecause of its beauty but because of his famous racing stables.\r\n\r\nBeyond that there wasn’t much that a child would even hear of,--there\r\nwas a ranch at Duarte and another called Azusa, and then far to the\r\neast, across foothills covered with sage and cactus, and mighty\r\n“washes” filled with granite boulders was Cucamonga Ranch with its old\r\nwinery and vineyard, planted sometime in the forties by members of the\r\nLugo family from the Rancho Santa Ana del Chino, across the valley. I\r\nunderstand that Chino means curly and relates to the character of the\r\nlocks of an early owner. This ranch was under the management of Isaac\r\nWilliams, a son-in-law of old Don Antonio Maria Lugo, the man who at\r\none time held leagues and leagues of land all the way from San Pedro to\r\nSan Bernardino. For many years it was a most hospitable way-station for\r\nall travelers from over the plains to Los Angeles. At the time when my\r\nfather came through the Chino supported ten thousand head of cattle,\r\nhalf as many horses and thirty-five thousand New Mexican sheep. What\r\nit was twenty-five years later I do not know, but the hey-day of the\r\nranches was over and the new town had not yet come.\r\n\r\nIn the far eastern end of the valley was the old town of San\r\nBernardino, so named probably because it was on that Saint’s day that\r\nthe padres established their _asistencia_. With the downfall of the\r\nmissions this early development was stopped, moreover the troubles\r\nwith “wild” Indians were greater here than in localities further from\r\nthe mountain passes. The present town dates from 1851 when a company\r\nof Mormons, about four hundred strong, came across the deserts and\r\nmountains from Salt Lake City, and purchasing a portion of the San\r\nBernardino Ranch from the Lugos, rapidly put a large acreage under\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThis ranch was owned by three young Lugos and their cousin, Diego\r\nSepulveda, whose grand-daughter, Mrs. Florence Schoneman, tells me that\r\nthey were delighted to sell and get a chance to move nearer the center\r\nof life at Los Angeles and consequently made the easiest terms with the\r\ncolonists--something like $500 down and the balance to be paid after\r\ncrops began to bring in returns.\r\n\r\nBefore long these thrifty settlers were shipping vegetables, flour\r\nand dairy products into Arizona and to Los Angeles, a three-day haul\r\naway. Their flour was ground in the mill built by Louis Rubidoux, who\r\nhad purchased a portion of the neighboring Jurupa grant from Don Juan\r\nBandidi, to whom the grant had been made a year or two after the time\r\nhe was traveling down the coast aboard the sail ship whereon Richard\r\nH. Dana was spending his two years before the mast. Louis Rubidoux,\r\nwhose name is kept in mind by the mountain that guards the entrance to\r\nthe modern Riverside, was a Frenchman, a native of St. Louis, who had\r\ncome into California in 1840 by way of New Mexico. He was a cultivated\r\nman and a successful rancher who later became interested in cutting\r\nup his land into smaller holdings and has the name of being the first\r\n“sub-divider” of Southern California, the one who set the fashion that\r\nhas of late grown to such appalling proportions.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of Riverside were made in 1870 when a colony of\r\npeople from various places in the East bought some of this bench land\r\nabove the Santa Ana River. Although the first plan was to go into the\r\ncultivation of the silk-worm for which there was a great enthusiasm\r\nfor a year or two even to the extent of general bounties offered by\r\nthe State legislature, it was not long before the town was in its\r\ncharacteristic groove; by the time we had moved to Los Angeles the\r\nfirst naval orange had fruited and the first Glenwood Inn offered a\r\nsetting for hospitality,--Riverside, oranges, tourists! But I knew\r\nnothing about it. Why should I? It was far away and very small, so far\r\nin fact that its inhabitants, according to a local history, allowed\r\na week for a trip to Los Angeles and return. At first they had to\r\ndrive all the way but after a few years there was a railroad extending\r\ntoward them as far as Uncle Billy Rubottom’s. And who now knows where\r\nthat was? It wasn’t Pomona, which then was barely in embryo, being\r\nrepresented by the few settlers under the San Jose Hills on the\r\nproperties belonging to the Palomares and the Vejars, and later to\r\nthe Phillips. “Uncle Billy” came from Spadra Bluffs in Arkansas, and\r\nmaintained a very popular way station for the Butterfield stages to\r\nwhich ultimately he gave the old home name, Spadra. Going on toward\r\nthe city one crossed the Puente Ranch and came to El Monte, which\r\ndoesn’t mean anything about mountains, but refers to the thickets of\r\nwillow that even today are characteristic of the place. “The Monte” it\r\nused to be called when first it was founded, a little later than San\r\nBernardino, by people who came in from Texas. Although now this town\r\nretains characteristics that might make it seem of Mexican origin it\r\nwas in its beginnings entirely an American settlement. It was chosen\r\nfor its good farm lands, and soon its citizens were making a success\r\nraising corn, melons, pumpkins, and hogs, and judging from the records\r\nof early chroniclers, rather strenuous boys who seemed ever ready to\r\njoin with Los Angeles in the wild doings that marked those days after\r\nthe gold excitement had brought to California multitudes of the bad as\r\nwell as of the good.\r\n\r\nAnaheim was the next town to be founded, following in 1857, the Los\r\nAngeles of 1781, and the two of 1851, San Bernardino and El Monte.\r\nAfter that the impulse for the starting of new communities gained\r\nheadway, not so fast during the sixties, but the seventies marked\r\nthe beginning of many now prosperous places and the booming eighties\r\nbrought to birth many a city (some of them still-born).\r\n\r\nAnaheim was projected by a group of San Francisco Germans who went\r\nabout its making in a characteristically methodical and thrifty way.\r\nSo far as I can discover it never went through the agonies of hope\r\nand despair that so often mark the course of utopian schemes for\r\nco-operative settlement.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted for its beginning was to purchase upward of eleven\r\nhundred acres, send an agent ahead who attended to the clearing\r\noff of the sage and cactus, the division of the land into twenty\r\nacre portions, ten acres of each being set out to vines, and to the\r\nlaying out of lots in the center for the necessary shops, school,\r\npost-office, etc. When all was ready the colonists came in a body,\r\nfinding everything prepared for them.\r\n\r\nTwo of the inhabitants of this town at a little later period were of\r\ngreat renown,--the Polish actress, Madame Helena Modjeska, who made her\r\nhome at a neighboring ranch, and Henryk Sienkiewicz, the author of Quo\r\nVadis, who spent a year or two in Anaheim.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things that had been done was the development of an\r\nintricate irrigation system, tapping the Santa Ana river for water.\r\nThis made an oasis of the colony during the terrible droughts that\r\ncame a few years later. The edges of the zanjas had been planted with\r\nwillows and cottonwoods and all about the settlement was a palisade\r\nof willow stakes, which, set in the damp soil, speedily sprouted and\r\nformed a leafy barrier to the thousands of desperate, starving cattle,\r\nwhich but for this defence, would have overrun the one green spot in\r\nall the country round.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of sprouting willows recalls the story that the first settlers\r\nin El Monte made rough bedsteads in their dirt floored houses from the\r\nnative wood and that shortly the posts put forth branches and made of\r\neach bed a bower.\r\n\r\nThe people of Anaheim were able almost at once to ship grapes to the\r\nSan Francisco market, and also were soon making a very good wine for\r\nsimilar export. They made use of a neighboring small harbor which soon\r\ncame to be known as Anaheim Landing. Recently my Aunt Margaret told me\r\nthat the first wool that they sent to San Francisco from the Cerritos\r\nwent from this place instead of from San Pedro as it did later.\r\n\r\nThe success of Anaheim led to the founding in following years of other\r\ncolonies and towns. Westminster, Santa Ana, Tustin were small centers\r\nto which I occasionally had the privilege of driving with my elders on\r\nbusiness bent.\r\n\r\nDowney, named for the popular governor, was nearer by and even in those\r\ndays attracted visitors by an agricultural fair. I recall a dusty trip\r\nover there to observe my only namesake, a Holstein bossy, winning a\r\nblue ribbon,--Sally, and her twin brother, who bore the name of my\r\nbeloved cousin, Harry.\r\n\r\nCompton to me was an established fact but to the ranch dwellers it was\r\na new Methodist place offering them the conveniences of a nearby post\r\noffice, church and physician. How well I remember Dr. Whaley, whose\r\npractices had not been tempered by a breath of homœpathy. When I had\r\nso bad a cold I couldn’t celebrate getting to be seven years old by\r\nthe promised picnic at the beach nor wear my bulky new bathing suit\r\nmade of heavy navy blue flannel and trimmed with three rows of white\r\ntape, he was called to cure me, which he proceeded to do by swabbing\r\nmy throat with thick yellow stuff with iron in it, by giving a black\r\ndose that necessitated the immediate cleaning of my teeth lest it\r\nrot them, and by ordering the application of a strong, large mustard\r\nplaster, first to my front, then to my back, then to each side, thus\r\nmaking a complete red jacket of burns about my body. Apparently it\r\ncured me. It is strange how popular mustard was in those days, not only\r\nthe terrible plasters but the torturing foot baths for colds--boiling\r\nwater reinforced by that awful stinging powder that came out of yellow\r\ncovered cans bearing the lion and unicorn of old England. I wonder\r\nif doctors and parents applied the cure to themselves as well as to\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nCompton was the second stop beyond Cerritos on the wonderful railroad\r\nfrom Wilmington to Los Angeles; the first was Dominguez and the third\r\nwas Florence and that was all until one reached Alameda Street, and\r\nthe “depot” which was on a corner by a flour mill. What fun it was to\r\ngo to the city. We got into the carriage in the court yard, and drove\r\nout through the gates and down the hill to the river, where sometimes\r\nthe fording was very exciting,--water might come into the buggy if\r\nit was winter and had been raining a long time; then there were two\r\nseparate “willows” to go through, only a half mile ride in all. Either\r\nwe were always very prompt or the train was not, for there was time and\r\npermission to put our ears down on the rail to listen for the coming\r\ntrain, and there was a low trestle over the “slew” where we might walk\r\nthe ties.\r\n\r\nI was amused to read recently in an old book the boast that Los Angeles\r\nwas a railroad center, the focus for four roads! This one that I\r\nknew was the first, twenty-three miles in length; next was the one\r\nto Spadra, longest of all, thirty miles; then one to San Fernando,\r\nreaching out through the grain fields of the valley twenty-two miles\r\ntoward San Francisco, and the Anaheim road, twenty-eight miles.\r\nProgress had arrived.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginnings of Los Angeles and San Gabriel, San Pedro was the\r\nport, but for very many years it remained the desolate spot that is\r\ndescribed in “Two Years Before the Mast.” There was one hide house to\r\nwhich, when a boat came into port, the accumulated stores of hides and\r\ntallow were hauled. These products which the inhabitants exchanged\r\nwith Yankee traders for everything they needed or wanted in the way of\r\nmanufactured goods, did not require very elaborate facilities, and it\r\nwas the custom to roll the bundles over the cliffs to the rocks below\r\nwhere the sailors must gather them up and carry on their heads out to\r\ntheir boats. The sailors also must carry over the rough trail to the\r\ntop of the bluff the boxes and bales containing their merchandise.\r\nSan Pedro was not a popular port. But conditions must have improved\r\nvery soon after the visits of Dana, for there is extant a letter from\r\nthe Angeleno of Boston origin, Abel Stearns, in which he tells of his\r\nnotion to improve the situation. He took up a collection among his\r\nfriends, to the amount of one hundred and fifty dollars, secured the\r\nservices of some mission Indians and in a few weeks had made the first\r\nroad down to water level.\r\n\r\nAfter the admission of California as a state, travel to and from Los\r\nAngeles increased and before long stages between San Pedro and the city\r\nbecame necessary. Don David Alexander and General Phineas Banning\r\nwere the prime movers who developed this. Gen. Banning is one of the\r\nmost picturesque figures of the early American period and was very\r\nactive in every field of the development of transportation. At one\r\ntime he was doing a large business freighting supplies over the Mormon\r\ntrail to Salt Lake City and the territory beyond. And he was largely\r\nresponsible for the building of that first railway, the San Pedro-Los\r\nAngeles, an improvement which put an end to the exciting stage races\r\nthat introduced to their future home both those chroniclers of early\r\ndays, Harris Newmark and Horace Bell, wild rides to a wilder community.\r\nPeople today sometimes deplore a “crime wave,” but to live up to the\r\nproportions set in 1853 Los Angeles should stage about four hundred\r\nmurders a day every day in the year, for that year there was an average\r\nof more than one killing a day in a population of about twenty-five\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1858, I believe, that Gen. Banning promoted the town New San\r\nPedro, later naming it for his birthplace in Delaware, Wilmington. Here\r\nhe built his home and planted the garden that remains today. I remember\r\ncalling there once with my mother and seeing a most lovely little girl\r\nout among the flowers.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the Civil War the Government established Drum\r\nBarracks in Wilmington, thus adding to its importance, and it was one\r\nof the government warehouses, later abandoned, which was purchased by\r\nthe Alamitos Co., taken down, moved the ten miles over to the ranch\r\nand rebuilt, where it can still be seen by motorists passing over the\r\nAnaheim Road, a great red barn with white trimmings.\r\n\r\nA forgotten fact about Wilmington is that it was the home of Wilson\r\nCollege, the gift of Don Benito to the Southern Methodists, and though\r\nshort-lived, was the fore-runner of such institutions as the University\r\nof Southern California, Occidental, and Pomona. This college was housed\r\nin two of the buildings of the deserted Drum Barracks.\r\n\r\nI have numerous memories of Wilmington, for it was there that my\r\nUncle John and Aunt Susan set up housekeeping, and lived until they\r\nmoved over to the Alamitos. From this port I once took steamer with\r\nmy parents for San Francisco, and received one of the most unexpected\r\nexperiences of my life, the sudden onset of sea-sickness as the steamer\r\nrounded Point Firmin. I was at dinner with father, enjoying an ear of\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nI also remember a Christmas tree at the church from which Santa Claus\r\nhanded me a little covered sewing box. This must have been the church\r\nwhich in its beginnings had so few attendants that there was only\r\none member who could sing at all, (Aunt Margaret told me), “Prophet”\r\nPotts, and as he knew but one hymn every Sunday the service contained\r\n“Coronation.”\r\n\r\nAunt Margaret used to tell another church story also. Soon after\r\nshe first came to Cerritos there was an attempt to organize a\r\nCongregational church in Los Angeles. The community approved, and\r\nalthough there were but six actual members, the minister and his wife,\r\nthe deacon and his wife, Mrs. Mary Scott and Mrs. Jotham Bixby, many\r\nother citizens contributed towards it and a lot was secured on the\r\nwest side of New High Street near Temple and a building was put up.\r\nEverything now was complete and the day of dedication approached. The\r\nvisiting minister from San Francisco came down by boat to Wilmington\r\nand was met by the Bixbys and taken over to the Cerritos for the\r\nnight. The next day they all drove the sixteen miles to the city to\r\ngo to church. Aunt Margaret noticed a certain constraint in the air\r\nand a black eye on the minister. After service she discovered that\r\nthe afternoon before the minister and the deacon had gotten into a\r\nfist fight in the furniture store over a red carpet for the church\r\nthat the deacon had purchased without authority. Poor minister, he was\r\nred-headed. He was so mortified that he resigned and the little church\r\nwent into a period of inanition. Sometime later the present First\r\nCongregational Church was organized and the firster one gave it the\r\nchurch property plus the debt for the red carpet. And I think the debt\r\nstill existed when I began attending that Sunday School several years\r\nlater. It was during the interval of non-activity that the Wilmington\r\nchurch was organized and the Cerritos people wended their way thither\r\non Sundays until the Methodist church in Compton, much nearer home, was\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nThe road to Wilmington from the Cerritos Ranch went southwest over the\r\nmesa and down across bottom lands where corn grew amazingly, so tall\r\nthat a man could stand on the seat of the spring wagon and not be able\r\nto see over the tops of the waving stalks.\r\n\r\nAnd Long Beach? There was none. Where it now stands was a grain field\r\nand its only buildings were a shed for the horses during threshing\r\ntimes, and the small house occupied during the grain season by\r\nArchibald Borden and his four sons from Downey who raised wheat and\r\nbarley on shares. After the harvest the Bixby sheep were turned in upon\r\nthe stubble fields.\r\n\r\nPeople were coming into Southern California more and more, especially\r\nafter rail connection with San Francisco came in 1877. The chorus of\r\nrapturous praise singers was swelling, and enterprising people began\r\nplotting new settlements. The time for the subdividing of the large\r\nholdings came on apace.\r\n\r\nI tramped over the level lands on the north end of the ranch, trailing\r\nthe surveyors who were marking off the acres that were going to the\r\nmaking of Clearwater, and saw it severed from the ranch without a\r\npang, but when Harry and I learned about Mr. Willmore and the American\r\nColony, who wanted Cerritos (Signal) Hill and the bluff and our beach\r\nwe resented it greatly. There was a seaside town at Santa Monica,--what\r\nneed of disturbing things as they were for the sake of another? Why\r\nshould conditions that we had always known, that were as much a part\r\nof living as day and night be rudely changed? But the grief of a\r\nlittle boy and little girl could not stay the march of the world and\r\nsoon we were insulted by fences and gates where before we had ridden\r\nunchecked. It wasn’t so very long, however, before we became resigned\r\nto the town that had first called itself Willmore City and then Long\r\nBeach, though we did think it might have kept its own old name,\r\nCerritos Beach. We liked the new hotel bath house which made dressing\r\nfor a swim much easier than when we had had to run far down the beach\r\nto find a projection of bluff large enough to provide modest shelter.\r\nAnd we didn’t mind the Methodist Tabernacle with its summer Chautauqua,\r\nor the little shop where we could buy fruit, for we seemed to be\r\ngetting over being children almost as fast as the new town was growing.\r\n\r\nBut whatever changes have come there has always been the sky, sunny\r\nor starry, or hidden by fog or passing cloud; the same mountains with\r\ntheir wonder of changing color guarded the valley. The old carpet\r\nof gorgeous wild flowers is gone; cities creep over the plain and a\r\nnetwork of roads covers the earth; there is scarcely a place where\r\none cannot see against the sky the fretted tower that means oil. One\r\nbeauty goes and perhaps another comes for those who have eyes to\r\nsee,--especially if they have a fair sized blind spot, which I find\r\nsometimes is a most satisfying possession.\r\n\r\nThe “old timers” wore just as powerful magnifying glasses when they\r\nlooked at the future as do certain boosters today. They saw the\r\npossibilities of the development of this Southern California and\r\nprophesied in the face of vacant fields and an unprotected harbor all\r\nthe things that have come to pass, and more. It would be pleasant to\r\nknow that Heaven afforded peep-holes in its walls through which these\r\ndreamers might look down to see what is now happening to their adored\r\n“land of sunshine.” I am sure that Admiral Henry Knox Thatcher, who\r\ncommanded the Pacific Squadron from 1866 to 1868, says “I told you so,”\r\nto grandfather when they meet on some golden street corner. Wouldn’t\r\nyou, if you had written this letter to him in the old days on earth?\r\n\r\n  Nahant, Mass.\r\n  Sept. 25th, 1879.\r\n\r\n  My dear friend Hathaway,\r\n\r\n  ... During my various visits do the port of San Pedro I observed the\r\n  facility with which that Bay could be made a perfectly secure harbor\r\n  for ships in all weather by simply building a mole of stone with\r\n  which the shore is lined for miles. And then blasting “Dead Man’s\r\n  Island” close at hand for the foundation of said mole and using the\r\n  millions of tons of smaller rocks to be found all along shore for\r\n  the filling in. At present the anchorage of S. P. is perfectly safe\r\n  so long as the wind remains north,--but when from the south no ship\r\n  could escape destruction at that anchorage unless supplied with steam\r\n  power. I foresaw that San Francisco would strongly oppose any attempt\r\n  to make S. P. a port of entry because it would deprive them of the\r\n  power of plundering that fair and fertile portion of California as\r\n  they now do. And all the products of that (best) portion of the\r\n  state must now be carried at great cost to the only exporting custom\r\n  house, S. F., whereas if they could be shipped directly from S. P.\r\n  the producers would save tens of thousands annually even now. But now\r\n  is as nothing, for the day is not far distant when Los Angeles and\r\n  adjoining counties will become the greatest producing counties on the\r\n  face of the globe; everything points to it, a soil of unsurpassed\r\n  fertility, and a climate as perfect as is to be found upon earth. It\r\n  is but for the people themselves to wake up and _insist_ upon aid\r\n  from government in accomplishing this noble work. With my feeble\r\n  efforts I did what I could to bring this about during my command of\r\n  the Pacific Squadron and secured the aid of the Republican member of\r\n  Congress from C. to induce Govm’t. to send out an able engineer to\r\n  survey the Port of S. P. with this object in view. I wrote articles\r\n  for the S. F. newspapers and had hopes of success but my term of\r\n  command expired and my successor felt no interest in the matter and\r\n  the few producers at that time appeared quite indifferent except Mr.\r\n  Banning of Wilmington, who seemed to be a man of enlarged views and\r\n  was then in public life and exerting considerable influence. But I\r\n  think the S. F. element was too strong for him to contend with. Yet\r\n  I am satisfied that this scheme will one day be accomplished, though\r\n  I may not live to see it. I felt at the time not a little sorry that\r\n  friend Jotham (who was as deeply interested as any) did not take more\r\n  thought on the subject of building up that lovely country; of course\r\n  the R. R. will aid in developing that lower section of California\r\n  but it will be found a very expensive mode of transportation compared\r\n  with the floating process. These are all crude ideas of mine you will\r\n  say perhaps, but they have taken firm possession of my mind and will\r\n  hardly be eradicated....\r\n\r\n  Affectionate friend, H. K. Thatcher.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the prediction in this letter that\r\nthe country about Los Angeles would become the greatest producing\r\ncountry in the world has been fulfilled so far as the United States is\r\nconcerned, for in the 1920 Census it is ranked first in agricultural\r\nproduction. The present development of San Pedro Harbor, now generally\r\ncalled Los Angeles Harbor, reads like a fairy story.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Thatcher was the grandson of Gen. Henry Knox, Washington’s\r\nfirst Secretary of War. The period of his command of the Pacific\r\nSquadron was from 1866 to 1868. Before the time of the writing of the\r\nletter quoted work was begun and a considerable break-water built,\r\nfollowing in general the lines he had suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII SCHOOL DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy education began the day I was born, for I am told that, after a\r\nsomewhat precipitous and unceremonious arrival, my father took me\r\nabout the room to see the pictures on the wall--sundry chromos and\r\nsteel engravings, which I am said to have observed with intelligence\r\nand pleasure. Having been intimately acquainted with several normal\r\ninfants, I doubt, however, both observation and pleasure. Perhaps that\r\nearly exposure to art was what determined my life-long interest in\r\nit, and in the joys of seeing. Those old-fashioned pictures may have\r\npresented to my inexperienced eye no more confused an image than do the\r\nlatest post-impressionist interpretations of essential form or the soul\r\nof things to my trained sight.\r\n\r\nAfter this introduction to the graphic arts I met poetry--familiar\r\nhymns and Mother Goose. I knew the ten little Indians who by a series\r\nof gruesome accidents were reduced to none, Prudy, Sanford and Merton\r\nwhom I loathed, Pocahontas and Robinson Crusoe. I still possess a\r\nnumber of books that date far back in my life, among them Mary Mapes\r\nDodge’s _Rhymes and Jingles_ and Whittier’s _Child Life_. The only\r\nthings my father ever read aloud to me were poems, usually out of the\r\nbig green and gold _Household Book of Poetry_. Aunt Martha read us\r\n_Helen’s Babies_, to my delight.\r\n\r\nI was reading at four. I have “Rewards of Merit,” small cards with gay\r\npictures given me at the end of each week when I had been a good little\r\ngirl and made proper progress in my reading lessons. And for my fifth\r\nbirthday my father printed in red ink a foolscap sheet of words for me\r\nto learn to spell, five columns beginning with words of two letters and\r\nrunning up to six letters each. I must have been greatly pleased with\r\nmy present for I remember it yet so happily. A letter written by my\r\nmother at this time says that I was insatiable in my demand for stories\r\nto be told to me and for books to be read.\r\n\r\nMy first school was a private one in First Street between Spring and\r\nMain in Los Angeles after I was seven. I remember very little about\r\nit. My career there was ended by the long sickness when father told me\r\nabout his early trips to California. The next school was supposed to be\r\nvery select, Miss Carle’s, over on Olive Street near Second in the same\r\nhouse with Miss Stem, my Adventist music teacher, who used to tell me\r\nthe world was about to end, but who could give no satisfactory answer\r\nto my contention that in that case I ought to be having harp lessons\r\ninstead of piano. The school numbered ten children and was conducted in\r\nMiss Carle’s bedroom, apparently, for in one corner stood a marvellous,\r\nhigh feather-bed; once when I carelessly stood on a chair to reach the\r\ntop of the black-board, she in anger tossed me across the room to this\r\nbed, where I disappeared in its feathery depths. Having acquired a\r\nlittle knowledge and considerable whooping-cough, this school was also\r\nconsigned to my past.\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Academy on Main Street, between Third and Fourth, was\r\nmy next educational resort. This was on the lot adjoining the famous\r\nold round-house, or better, fourteen-sided house,--each of whose sides\r\nwas labelled with the name of one of the thirteen original states and\r\nCalifornia. It had been for many years a popular resort and beer garden\r\ncalled “The Garden of Eden.” But its days of glory were past, and the\r\nmarble Adam and Eve who had adorned it were gone; no flaming sword was\r\nvisible, but there was a formidable cactus hedge on the Spring Street\r\nside which may have deterred them from return. There was vacant land\r\non the east side of Main Street opposite the school, where one of the\r\ncity zanjas ran beside a row of willows at the foot of a little hill.\r\nPlaying here one noon I attempted to wade and was unceremoniously swept\r\nfrom my feet and sent sailing down the flume. I suppose I learned\r\nsomething at this school, but I know that I have always suffered from\r\nlack of drill in plain addition and subtraction, so I think I shall\r\nhave to blame the Los Angeles Academy for hampering me in calculus and\r\nother of the higher reaches of mathematics.\r\n\r\nWhen I was ten I was somewhat desperately and gingerly consigned to the\r\npublic schools, where I would much better have been from the beginning.\r\nI started in the fifth grade under Mrs. Ella Enderlein, later a\r\nnewspaper woman well known in the city. I had the good fortune to\r\nhave both sixth and seventh grade work with Mrs. C. G. Du Bois, a rare\r\nteacher, who remained in the school system for many, many years, and\r\nwill be lovingly remembered by numerous men and women of Los Angeles\r\nwho were also once the boys and girls of this city. When I knew her\r\nshe wore six little grey curls hanging at the back of her head, and\r\nshe had the merriest blue eyes,--we learned our lessons well for her.\r\nThere was a strange principal who used to walk about the halls arrayed\r\nlike Solomon in all his glory. He wore slippers and a dressing gown of\r\noriental patterns and coloring, trimmed with a sapphire blue. Perhaps\r\nhis style of dress had something to do with his disappearance from our\r\nview. His successor was an excellent teacher, I know, for he taught\r\nme in the eighth grade; however he had a bad temper and once threw an\r\neraser at one of the girls and chased a boy up and down the aisles and\r\nover our desks in a vain attempt to thrash him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bradfield was art teacher for all the schools in the city and gave\r\nme my first lessons. As I had something of a gift for drawing I was\r\nallowed on all possible public occasions to decorate the blackboards\r\nwith colored chalk pictures and designs, often Kate Greenaway children,\r\nor sun-flowers after Oscar Wilde.\r\n\r\nMy four years of grammar school were passed in the first high school\r\nbuilding, located on Pound Cake Hill, about where the upper story of\r\nthe County Court House now is. When the site was wanted by the men-folk\r\nof the town, the school building was moved on a mighty trestle across\r\nTemple Street and over to California Street and the hill itself was\r\ndecapitated.\r\n\r\nWhen I was ready for high school I went down to the new grammar school\r\nbuilding at Sixth Street which occupied the Mercantile Place property\r\nbetween Spring and Broadway. I daily walked along a Broadway of\r\ncottages and gardens and occasional churches. Often I picked a flower\r\nor a Chinese orange from Aunt Margaret’s yard at Second Street; and, as\r\nI passed, I looked down the lovely Third Street, shaded by large pepper\r\ntrees, to a cottage covered by an enormous rose bush.\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles High School was temporarily accommodated in four rooms\r\nand an office, while the new building up next the old graveyard on\r\nNorth Hill Street, was being constructed. It is said that for several\r\nyears the high school children ate their noon lunches sitting on\r\ntombs and cemetery curbs. In my day there were fewer than two hundred\r\nstudents. The course was not unlike the simpler ones of today, but\r\nthere were not so many electives and none of the manual and technical\r\nclasses. In the ninth grade I had Latin, Rhetoric, Algebra, Physical\r\nGeography, and Ancient History; and in the tenth, Latin, Geometry,\r\nEnglish and English History,--not so very different from the present\r\ncollege preparatory, is it?\r\n\r\nMrs. Bradfield taught drawing in the high school as well as in the\r\ngrades. It was under her that Guy Rose got his first art lessons. Music\r\nalso had a special teacher and under Prof. Kent we sang lustily--among\r\nother things “We are the gay students of fair Salamanca.” His high silk\r\nhat, his close fitting Prince Albert coat, his waxed moustache, his\r\nsmile, and tripping steps were very entertaining to the children.\r\n\r\nAt this time it was determined to send me north to school for a change\r\nof climate. Oakland at that time was a center of private schools and\r\nacademies. I went to Field Seminary, long since extinct. The life\r\nin a well-governed boarding school was something new to me. I, who\r\nhad ranged freely, must take my daily exercise in a regulated walk,\r\nthe girls going two by two up and down the city streets. It was\r\nsurprising how soon this habit affected my point of view. Once, after\r\ndue deliberation and considering of my record, recommendations, and\r\npedigree, I was allowed to walk alone around the corner--no street was\r\nto be crossed--to take dinner with my cousins, the Ben Flint family.\r\nIt is a wonder I did not crawl through the paling fence where the back\r\nyards met, for such was the effect of the constant mass movements that\r\nwhen I stepped alone out of the gate into the peaceful street I felt\r\nas embarrassed as if I had shed my garments, along with the protecting\r\nphalanx of pupils and guarding teacher.\r\n\r\nOn Thursdays I was excused from exercise to take a bath. The rule of\r\nthe clock was rigid, and when it said four o’clock on Thursday I must\r\nbe ready to enter and bathe, or go forever unbathed. What a smashing of\r\nprecedent! But I suppose one tub could not accommodate over forty girls\r\non Saturday night, the correct American bath night.\r\n\r\nThe actual school work was a delight, with glimpses into new fields:\r\nchemistry, where we saw samples of aluminum, a metal which might some\r\nday become very useful; geology, with a long trip on the street car\r\nmiles and miles into the country to the State University at Berkeley,\r\nwhere Professor Le Conte told us most interesting things--geology,\r\ngently tuned by Professor Thomas Heaton to meet the exigencies of\r\nMosaic “days of creation,” and yet opening the mind to questionings.\r\nThere was also Cicero and an introduction into the German language and\r\nEnglish literature. I even read the whole of _Paradise Lost_. Then, bad\r\neyes, and a verdict of never any more school, not even sight enough for\r\nsewing! But oculists don’t know everything always.\r\n\r\nAnd so I came home. In the house were many books,--always had been\r\nso long as I could remember. The rigid Maine rule of semi-annual\r\nhouse-cleaning held sway, and it was often my task to take out, beat,\r\ndust and replace all the volumes in the capacious bookcases. There were\r\nessays, histories, biographies: sets of Dickens, Thackeray, George\r\nEliot, Hawthorne, Scott, besides scattered novels; Shakespeare was\r\nthere and a few other dramatists, all the standard poets, Cervantes\r\nand Plutarch. These were not only dusted, but read to a great or less\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n_Harper’s Magazine_, with its buff cover adorned with cupids,\r\ncornucopias, fruits and flowers, was a regular visitor, as was the\r\n_Century_ later. I recall the laughter of a family reading of Frank\r\nStockton’s _The Casting Away of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine_. _The\r\nCongregationalist_ and _The Pacific_ provided Sunday reading for\r\nfather, along with his Bagster’s _Bible_. He once pointed out to me\r\nmildly that the varying accounts of the Hebrew historical events did\r\nnot “jibe.” Several missionary magazines gave knowledge of life in far\r\nparts of the world. _Littell’s Living Age_ came for several years, and,\r\nbeing bound, was at least handled semi-annually.\r\n\r\nThe tri-weekly _New York Tribune_ and _Harper’s Weekly_ (until it\r\nturned mug-wump) brought news out of the East to supplement what two\r\ndaily papers afforded. I think father knew where every raw material in\r\nthe world was produced and where it was manufactured. He used to “poke\r\nfun” at me as an educated woman, after I returned from college, because\r\nI could not name, characterize and assign to his state every United\r\nStates Senator.\r\n\r\nI had the advantage of a home where good English was spoken, where one\r\nwas expected to know how to spell correctly and write grammatically,\r\nwhere an interest was taken in large and wide questions, and where\r\neveryone found his chief pleasure and amusement in reading. Rather a\r\nbad environment in which to find oneself condemned to useless eyes!\r\n\r\nLos Angeles did not in those days offer, naturally, the same\r\nopportunities in art, theater, and music that the East did, but I saw\r\nBooth and Barrett in _Julius Caesar_ and I heard Adelina Patti.\r\n\r\nWhen my aunt came to our home she brought with her about a hundred\r\nphotographic copies of the world’s famous paintings and pictures of\r\ncathedrals and statuary. On many a Sunday afternoon I pored over these\r\nuntil the names of Ralphael, da Vinci, Murillo, Phidias became as\r\nfamiliar as Longfellow or Scott.\r\n\r\nAs was customary, a faithful attempt extending over many years, was\r\nmade to make a musician out of me. It failed. I was eye-minded. That\r\nexposure to art on my natal day had determined my tastes.\r\n\r\nVacations, the most welcome part of the school year, were spent, with\r\nthe exception of one summer in the East, for the most part at the\r\nCerritos. As the resort grew at Long Beach and we young folks attained\r\nage we passed many hours on the sand and in the breakers. Then, when I\r\nwas eighteen, I had my first experience of camp life at Avalon, just\r\nestablished at Catalina. I learned to swim and dive, to tramp and sleep\r\non the ground. For three summers we did this while the island was yet\r\nprimitive and uncrowded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV PIONEERING AT POMONA COLLEGE\r\n\r\n\r\n“It must be a college of the New England type--just where and how it is\r\nto be started is the question,” said one of the men who, one evening in\r\nthe middle eighties, were discussing with my father and grandfather the\r\npossibility and need of a good college in Southern California, one of\r\nhigh standards of character and scholarship. There was no question of\r\nnecessity--only of ways and means. The boys and girls must be given the\r\nsame type of education as that offered in the far away homeland.\r\n\r\nSouthern California was booming, and hearts and hopes were high. It\r\nwas a bold undertaking for the small group of Congregationalists, but\r\nwith faith and hard work and time it could be done--the founding of\r\na college, “Christian, but not sectarian, for both sexes,” a slogan\r\nfrom the first. Later the hopes and dreams of the few crystalized into\r\naction and the word came home that a committee had been appointed to\r\nfind a location.\r\n\r\nAfter much jaunting, even so far as Banning, on the east, the choice\r\nfell upon Piedmont, a sightly mesa north of Pomona, a little town that\r\nhad recently been growing up some forty miles east of Los Angeles; and\r\nuntil a permanent name could be decided upon (possibly that of some\r\ndevoted donor) the venture was to be named “The Pomona College.” This\r\nname was not finally accepted for some twenty years.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I heard of the progress of the undertaking. Father’s\r\ncousin, Nathan Blanchard, who had been disappointed in his boyhood\r\nambition for a college education in Maine, was much concerned in this\r\nproject for providing opportunity for the young people of his later\r\nstate. He became one of the first trustees, and continued on the\r\nboard and was vitally interested so long as he lived. It was to his\r\ngenerosity that the college owes its beautiful acreage of oaks and\r\nnative growth, Blanchard Park.\r\n\r\nRev. Charles B. Sumner, the minister of the Pomona Congregational\r\nchurch, had secured a young man, Frank Brackett, recently graduated\r\nfrom Dartmouth to open a private school in Pomona. It met in the\r\nchurch parlor. Mr. Sumner’s son and daughter and a few others\r\nneeded a chance to prepare for college. After about six months the\r\nauthorities of the new college took over this school as a preparatory\r\ndepartment--teachers, students, and all.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, plans for a permanent building were maturing, and amid\r\nhopes and prayers, joy and a certain trepidation, the corner stone was\r\nlaid on the beautiful heights at the mouth of Live Oak Cañon, close to\r\nthe mountains, with a wide outlook over the valley.\r\n\r\nWhen plans for the college first took form, Southern California was\r\nfull of hope and enthusiasm--those were the boom days. Men were making\r\nfortunes over night, and the generosity of many hearts promised\r\nsufficient support for the college. But the point of saturation in land\r\nspeculation was reached and a panic was precipitated and the new-born\r\nenterprise faced disaster. Then began years of self-denial, struggle,\r\ndevotion, visions that have resulted in the college known today. Many a\r\ntime it was a very serious question whether or not the breath of life\r\ncould be kept in the baby.\r\n\r\nAbout the time I came home from Field Seminary, condemned to no more\r\nschool, the young institution was offered the empty hotel in the\r\nunsuccessful boom town of Claremont, together with certain lots staked\r\nout about it. The trustees decided to accept the gift, planning to use\r\nthis site ultimately for the preparatory work only, and to go on with\r\nits college buildings at Piedmont as originally intended.\r\n\r\nThe following June the school introduced itself with closing exercises,\r\noral examinations, etc. Grandfather was among the guests. Although he\r\nwas now over eighty, he spent much of every day with books, reading\r\nconstantly his Greek or Latin, or solving mathematical problems for\r\nsheer joy in it. He was delighted by an oral examination in Greek given\r\nby a Mr. Norton, the new head of the school. One boy especially pleased\r\nhim by showing evidence of good teaching and by the gusto with which\r\nhe translated his Homer. He “believed the boy was the son of Deacon\r\nBarrows of the Ojai.” Perhaps this same boy’s enthusiasm for the war\r\nexploits of Homer is responsible for the military fervor of the man.\r\n\r\nSo when I decided that my eyes, fortified by glasses, were not yet\r\ngone, and that I must go to school again, grandfather suggested that\r\nI try the new one at Pomona. “Of course it is pioneering, but seems\r\ngenuine and worth trying,” he said. Consequently, on a hot August day,\r\nAunt Martha and I went forth to investigate, and, perhaps beginning a\r\nlong line of the mistaken, sought Pomona College in Pomona.\r\n\r\nAfter some delay we found a man with an express wagon who took us to\r\nClaremont, an hour’s drive under a scorching noonday sun. We soon left\r\nthe little settlement, passed the apricot and peach orchards that have\r\nsince been replaced by oranges, and struck off in a diagonal through\r\nvirgin land to the large building, gabled and turreted, standing alone\r\nin the distance. As we came nearer we discovered that there was more\r\ntown than we had realized. The same Santa Fe station that is now in use\r\nwas in its place--would that we had arrived there instead of at the\r\nSouthern Pacific in Pomona!\r\n\r\nOn the sandy road, now Yale Avenue, there was one store, which\r\ncontained the post office,--a primitive department store kept by Mr.\r\nUrbanus, whose name was the only suggestion of a city in the region. A\r\nlittle farther up the road was a spare, white, box of a house, which\r\nhas since grown porches and a garden, where we found the principal of\r\nthe school, Mr. Norton, with his wife and baby girl, Katharine. To\r\nthe east was Mr. Biely’s barn; to the west Colonel W. H. Holabird’s\r\ntwo-storied house; and two or three other small empty houses peeked\r\nover the top of the brush. On the outskirts rose an imposing red and\r\nyellow towered and ornamented school house, waiting for the children\r\nof the visioned city to materialize. Some twenty years later it was\r\nsupplanted by the present attractive grammar school, moved across the\r\nstreet, and, with form and color made more modest, given over to the\r\nuse of the city fathers.\r\n\r\nThe ex-hotel belonged to the same architectural period as the Del Monte\r\nat Monterey or the Coronado at San Diego, but naturally it was of\r\nlesser glory.\r\n\r\nSuch was Claremont in 1889; no streets, no walks, just a few spots\r\nreclaimed from the desert, connected by trails or sandy roads; all the\r\nrest sage, cactus, stones, an occasional oak or sycamore; but the same\r\never-beautiful and mysterious mountains stood guard, the same sunny\r\nskies and fragrant air gave charm. Rabbits scuttled between the bushes,\r\nlizards and horned toads enjoyed the climate, rattlesnakes found a\r\npeaceful home, and at night coyotes ranged and sang.\r\n\r\nA little clearing had been made about the aforetime hotel now devoted\r\nto the incipient college, and vines and trees had been planted but\r\nas yet they had not made sufficient growth to be noticeable. The oak\r\ntree that now stands in the center of College Avenue was then in its\r\nnative state in the midst of the brush. The building with its meager\r\nfurnishing had stood empty all summer and accumulated dust added to\r\nits dreariness. However the plan of work offered me was attractive\r\nand, much to the surprise of my aunt, I decided to enter in the\r\nfall, thus beginning the procession of children, grandchildren,\r\ngreat-grandchildren of the old scholar who from that day to this have\r\nbeen connected with the college.\r\n\r\nIn September the third member of the so-called “old faculty,” Miss\r\nSpalding, arrived. She was destined to develop the English department,\r\nbut this year filled in, teaching Latin, German, spelling and\r\ncomposition, and how many other subjects I do not know.\r\n\r\nAll the activities of the school were in the one building. The large\r\nparlor with the circular window was chapel and assembly room. The room\r\noccupied in recent years by the Dean of Women was study hall for the\r\nyounger students; Prof. Norton had a small classroom on the east side,\r\nMiss Spalding had half the dining room roughly partitioned off, and\r\nProf. Brackett dispensed mathematics and physics over the bar in the\r\nhotel bar-room. He dispensed the physics so successfully that I was\r\nable three years later in Wellesley college to rely once or twice on\r\nClaremont knowledge to carry me through a physics lesson otherwise\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\nThe Hall housed all the resident members of the school except Mr.\r\nNorton’s family. Mr. Brackett and his bride were on the first floor;\r\nand upstairs, divided by a partition, pervious to sounds and notes, if\r\nnot to persons, were the men’s and women’s dormitories--eleven boys in\r\nthe former, four girls and two teachers in the latter. Here also roomed\r\nMiss Roe, sister of E. P. Roe of _Chestnut Burr_ fame, a forerunner of\r\nthe easterners who now make Claremont their winter home.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were about sixty students in the school, only one of\r\nthem, Helen Sumner, being of college rank. In the senior preparatory\r\nclass which I joined, there were about a dozen. They formed the unique\r\nclass that for seven years was the most advanced in the school--think\r\nhow dangerous to heads the experience of being seniors for seven years!\r\nThis class graduated from Pomona college in 1894 and numbered among its\r\nmembers Dr. George Sumner and Dr. David P. Barrows.\r\n\r\nThe year I joined them I found each member of the class had read Caesar\r\nduring the summer vacation, taking examination and passing in September\r\nin order that the class might go on with the required amount of Cicero\r\nin the first semester and Vergil in the second, and so make college\r\nthe next fall, with four years of Latin done, and done thoroughly in\r\ntwo years. With Vergil at nine in the morning (after submitting to\r\nten minutes of spelling drill on any word Miss Spalding might find in\r\nDr. Johnson’s _Rasselas_), and again at four in the afternoon we read\r\nrapidly enough to get the charm of the poem as well as the dry bones of\r\nvocabulary and construction. All the work of the year was strenuous but\r\nfull of delight--the happiest year of all my school life.\r\n\r\nThe primitive conditions of a pioneer school only added zest to the\r\nstudents, but for those teachers who had come out of the East the\r\nbarn-like hotel in the desert, the lack of comforts and conveniences,\r\neven of sufficient food, and the meager salaries possible meant\r\nhardship.\r\n\r\nOne of the institutions of our day was the bus which met students from\r\nPomona who came to North Pomona on the “dummy,” which I recognized\r\nas the discarded, first means of transportation between Long Beach\r\nand the outside world. Down there it had been known as the G. O. P.,\r\n“Get Out and Push,” because frequently the male passengers had to\r\ndismount and help propel it when it hesitated in its progress from\r\nThenard, the junction on the main S. P. line near Wilmington, to the\r\nlittle camp-meeting settlement on the bluff, Long Beach. When it was\r\nsuperseded there it evidently had been transferred to the remote\r\nservice between Pomona and the new Santa Fe railroad to the north of\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nThe bus was very rickety, two long seats whose cushions sprouted\r\nexcelsior, a somewhat tremulous canopy top, a rear step that swung\r\nloose so that it required great skill to mount, especially since there\r\nwas a hole in the floor where one would naturally place one’s foot in\r\nentering. It must have been a gift bus, into whose mouth one must not\r\nlook enquiringly.\r\n\r\nBret Harte, a high, bony, bay horse, and Amos Obediah Jonah Micah, a\r\nroly-poly squat sorrel were the mis-mated pair who provided locomotion.\r\nI was once told that the bones of one of these horses is preserved in\r\nthe college museum, but an after thought on the part of the informer,\r\nsuggested that the historic skeleton might have upheld one of the\r\nsteeds celebrated a year or two later,--Bismarck or Gladstone or\r\nMephistopheles. Speaking of the latter reminds me of a story once\r\ncurrent in Claremont concerning a conversation between the heads of\r\nthe Latin and Greek departments. “I can make a pun on any word you will\r\npropose,” said Professor Colcord. “How about the name of my horse?”\r\nreplied Professor Norton. Quick as a wink came the response, “If I had\r\nhim here I could hit him with me-fist-awful-easy.”\r\n\r\nMy year in Claremont was an unusually rainy one, and for a time all the\r\nlower part of town was under water from outbreaking springs. It was\r\nwelcomed by John McCall, the boy who drove the bus, as a providential\r\nmeans of extending the usefulness of the public conveyance. Every night\r\nhe took the bus to the point now called the corner of Second Street and\r\nAlexander Avenue, unhitched Bret and Amos, and left it standing in the\r\nwater all night, so that the rims of the wheels might swell enough to\r\nretain the tires the next day.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays the bus must forego its day of rest in order to take\r\nClaremont to Pomona to church, the former town not yet having a church\r\nof its own. We enlivened the long, slow drive home, more than an hour\r\nin our slow-going chariot, with calling up memories of all the good\r\nthings to eat we had ever known or imagined. We were none too well fed\r\nat best and Sunday dinner came late. It is certain that we did not\r\nsuffer from over-feeding, but, on the other hand, I suppose our minds\r\nwere all the clearer for our restrained diet.\r\n\r\nThis was the time of the beginning of things. The Pomona College\r\nLiterary Society--high sounding name--had begun its career. Debates,\r\npapers, three-minute ex-tempore speeches were taken seriously. One\r\ngala day in spring we turned to Mother Goose and treated her works\r\nin the same manner in which we had been handling Shakespeare. One\r\nnumber on the program was a debate on “Was the mother justified in\r\nwhipping Jill on the occasion when she and Jack went for water?” I\r\nremember it well for I defended Jill in opposition to David Barrows.\r\nIt was the first time that either of us had delivered a speech without\r\nnotes. Unfortunately, I lost--but who could expect to win against the\r\neloquence and, I maintained at the time, the sophistry of an embryo\r\nUniversity President? However, it was a split verdict and one of the\r\njudges resisted his plausible arguments and gave credit to the weight\r\nof my feminine defense of poor Jill. (Thank you, Dr. Sumner!) The\r\ndebate was great fun.\r\n\r\nThis year the college paper was born, and christened the _Pomona\r\nStudent_. It was a monthly, and, considering that it was conducted by\r\npreparatory students, compares very well with its later representative,\r\neven if I, who was its maid-of-all-work, do say so.\r\n\r\nThere was a music department, with Miss Stella Fitch as teacher. During\r\nthe next few years music became quite a feature, and its quality is\r\nrecalled with pleasure and regret in these days of prevailing jazz.\r\n\r\nAs for Athletics, tennis and baseball had arrived, but no football or\r\ntrack work. Several students had their own saddle horses and one or two\r\ncould be hired. A happy memory is of a spring day, a ride through the\r\nfragrant sagebrush, a running race down Ontario’s long street,--a good\r\ntime even if I did wear a long black habit and ride a sidesaddle.\r\n\r\nOn the first Mountain Day we went to Live Oak Cañon--perhaps thirty of\r\nus. We led the outdoor life that has always been so large a part of\r\nPomona College attractiveness. I wonder if any one since my day, after\r\na picnic in the Wash, enjoyed an afternoon of sledding. Four of us,\r\nnaturally two boys and two girls, once topped off a “steak-feed” by\r\nsliding down the short, grassy slope of the knoll, south of the present\r\nGreek Theater, with a frying pan and an iron baker for our sleds.\r\n\r\nThe heating arrangements in the Hall were primitive, so that a minor\r\nobject of every walk was to collect combustible material. I’m afraid\r\nthat a good many corner lot stakes went up in our smoke. The little\r\nstoves were amusing. As I remember them, they seem about six inches\r\nsquare, by twelve long, but I suppose they really must have been at\r\nleast ten by fifteen. One day I went in under the Hall in search of\r\nchips left from the building, but meeting there two cunning little\r\nblack and white wood-pussies, I quickly and silently retreated, lest\r\nthey should consider me a poacher on their preserves and protest.\r\n\r\nThe college library at that time occupied partially half a dozen\r\nshelves in an alcove. Miss Spalding, who had brought two hundred books\r\nwith her out of the East as a nucleus for the library was in charge,\r\nand in the spring term inspired us to see how much we could earn for\r\nits benefit. Soon all sorts of enterprises were under way. Our dining\r\ntable instituted a system of penny fines for tardiness or slang. I was\r\nbook-keeper and still hold the record. Individuals offered their wares\r\nor talents for the fund. In the April number of the _Student_ I find\r\nvarious advertisements: “We sadly look at our tattered garments, but\r\nsuddenly our faces light up, for we remember that Miss Metkiff darns\r\nat 1 cent per square inch.” “R. S. Day Jr., famous tonsorial artist.\r\nHair cut, fifteen cents; shave, ten cents. Bangs cut and curled, ten\r\ncents; long hair shampooed twenty-five cents; short hair, ten cents.”\r\nAttractive rates offered by the first Claremont barber, you must admit.\r\n\r\nI, who owned one of the original kodaks, taking pictures about the\r\nsize of a butter plate, made one very successful photograph. Rev. E.\r\nS. Williams, a visitor at the college, volunteered to give Bancroft’s\r\n_History of the United States_ to the infant library in exchange for a\r\npicture of the Student Body. Our labors netted much fun, the history,\r\nand about thirty dollars.\r\n\r\nExcitement grew as Commencement approached, for a class of eleven was\r\nready for college and in September the actual work of college grade\r\nwould begin. Although the closing exercises were made much of, and\r\nguests came from all over Southern California, we youngsters were never\r\nallowed to forget that we were merely “preps,” and, lest we should\r\nimagine ourselves of too much importance, no diplomas were allowed us.\r\nWe were told by Mr. Norton that we were “nothing but kids.” To remedy\r\nthis lack of evidence of our graduation, two of us picked out, finger\r\nby finger, on the only typewriter in town, diplomas modeled on an\r\nAmherst one, in which we granted ourselves the degree of “Haedi (kids)\r\nin Artibus.” These we distributed at our class supper, served in Mr.\r\nBrackett’s bar room. On this occasion our class prophet established her\r\nclaim to be a seer for she said, speaking of David Barrows:\r\n\r\n“What are you, priest, poet or philosopher?”\r\n\r\n“I am in the P’s at any rate,--purveyor.”\r\n\r\n“Of mental merchandise,” said his sister.\r\n\r\n“Allow me,” said a merry voice at my elbow, “to introduce Mr. Barrows,\r\nH.A., B.A., M.A., D.D., LL.D., Ph.D., president of ... college, the\r\nleader of young shoots in the way they should go.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Vere Metkiff was a suggestor rather than a seer, and it may\r\nhave been this prophecy that set the boy in the path to the presidency\r\nof the University of California. I observe, however, that he is still\r\nminus the proposed degree of D.D.\r\n\r\nThe next day a boy and girl sat all day on the stairs of Claremont Hall\r\nand crammed Roman History out of two brick-red primers, and in the\r\nafternoon took two college entrance examinations, to meet necessary\r\nrequirements. And they both passed. And perhaps they know as much Roman\r\nHistory now as if they had spent months instead of hours in its study.\r\n\r\nAnd so the year ended, and I left to go east to college as had been\r\nplanned for me so long as I could remember. But had there not been\r\nstiffer backbones than mine at home, I think I would have been a member\r\nof that first class at Pomona.\r\n\r\nMy friends did not forget me, and twice I hurried home from Wellesley\r\nto go into camp with them up in San Antonio Cañon, two wonderful\r\nexperiences. Our party of twenty-six was the first of any size to go\r\nbeyond Hogsback. We had to go to its base by wagon, and then over the\r\ntrail, walking on up to the mouth of Bear Cañon where we stayed for ten\r\ndays. From here a dozen of us made the ascent of the peak, ten-thousand\r\nfeet high. Six of us stayed the night to see the wonder of the sun\r\ncoming up out of the desert,--one of the rare memories of my life.\r\n\r\nThe three teachers, Prof. Brackett, Dr. Norton, and Dr. Spalding,\r\nwhom I knew in that long ago day of the beginning of things, have all\r\nthese years been giving of their strength and knowledge. And Dr. C.\r\nB. Sumner, who dreamed and planned and worked for the college, lives\r\nto see it established and prosper, its bare, single building grown to\r\nthe beautiful campus and many buildings of the present, its student\r\nbody increased more than ten fold, while his son, the youngest of that\r\nfamous class, has for years been a valued and loved professor in the\r\nstrong and growing college of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first shovelful of earth was turned for Wellesley College the day\r\nbefore I was born, and when I was ready to enter as a student, only\r\neleven classes had been graduated. Yet to me, coming as I did, from\r\nthe embryonic, frontier college, with its single building in a waste\r\nof cactus and sagebrush, Wellesley, with its many dignified buildings\r\nset beside Lake Waban in a campus of sweeping lawns and stately trees,\r\nseemed an institution not only honorable, but ancient. Because of my\r\nthree earlier visits in the East, the conditions of climate and of\r\nvillage life were not unknown to me, but it was the four continuous\r\ncollege years spent in the environment to which my race was wont, and\r\nto which my instinct responded, that brought me my heritage of joy in\r\nthe slipping seasons, and made possible an understanding reading of the\r\nsongs of our English tongue from “Sumer is icumen in” to “When lilacs\r\nlast in the door yard bloomed.”\r\n\r\nWellesley’s hills and meadows, her trees, her birds, her lake brought\r\nme an ecstasy that lingers; her out-of-doors became an integral part of\r\nme, stored pictures of the wide whiteness of winter, with snow-laden\r\nfirs or interlacing crystal branches, or of an autumn sunset sky,\r\nglorious behind a black screen of naked trees; memories of hepaticas\r\nand snowdrops in early spring, of anemones and crow-foot violets; of\r\na mist of new pale leaves on the elms and red buds on the maples; of\r\nlushness of green June, and waxen lilies on summer streams, a greenness\r\nand wetness unlike my land at home, unlike my California with its wide\r\nskies and open miles, its great mountains, its grays and tans, its far\r\nblues and wistful purples. It is blessed I am to know two homes.\r\n\r\nTime in its passing brought me to college, not to the one which I\r\nhad been destined from birth, Mt. Holyoke, but to Wellesley. The\r\nformer had not then transformed itself from a female seminary into a\r\nwoman’s college, so, since the value of a degree for women had become\r\nincreasingly apparent, it was deemed wise for the girl going three\r\nthousand miles to school to go to the institution of the higher rank.\r\nNeither Berkeley nor Stanford University, though near home, had been\r\nconsidered. The State University was of necessity non-religious and\r\nhence somewhat suspect of the orthodox, and Stanford was new and\r\nuntried--and besides--didn’t it derive its support from race horses\r\nand a winery? Moreover, New England parentage and tradition sent the\r\nchildren “home,” if possible, for their education.\r\n\r\nWith Mt. Holyoke eliminated, the choice lay between Smith and\r\nWellesley, and fell upon the latter for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Wellesley was reputed to be modeled on the beloved\r\nschool of Mary Lyon, and to have preserved some of its best features.\r\nIn the second place--the location near Boston gave it an advantage\r\nover its sister inland college in the way of music, art, libraries,\r\nmuseums. It was also, by virtue of its situation, more accessible to\r\nvisitors, and many a notable person, drawn by the glamour that still\r\nlingered about a woman’s college, came to inspect the materialization\r\nof Tennyson’s vision of _The Princess_. The inspection of visitors and\r\ngirls was mutual, and, we hope, of advantage to both. In the third\r\nplace, and this is what finally decided me, I preferred the course of\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nI entered college on certificate, covering the work I had done in three\r\nschools, the Los Angeles High School, Field Seminary in Oakland, and\r\nPomona College Preparatory School in Claremont. So far as I can judge,\r\nmy western preparation was as effective as that of my classmates who\r\ncame from the East and the Middle-West.\r\n\r\nCollege life is broken by vacations. I was fortunate in being able to\r\nreturn to my home for the long summers, while seeing various parts of\r\nthe East during the shorter recesses. With great delight each June I\r\nleft Massachusetts, beautiful to look upon, intolerable to live in,\r\ngoing to California’s comfortable southwest coast. I was always sped\r\non my way by the pities of my friends who ignorantly supposed that\r\nCalifornia climate was so much warmer than the eastern in summer as it\r\nis in winter. I doubt if any of my friends were so cool as I.\r\n\r\nThe eight trips back and forth across the continent gave opportunity\r\nto see many different places. One journey by the Canadian Pacific gave\r\nglimpses of the old city of Montreal, of the lovely land north of\r\nLake Superior and of the grandeur of the great northern Rockies. On\r\nanother trip a stop-over in Chicago gave me ten days at the Columbian\r\nExposition, whose chief memory is of the dignified white buildings, the\r\nart collection, and the lighted lagoons at night.\r\n\r\nMy shorter vacations included one each in Chicago, Boston, New York\r\nCity, and Washington, where I had the privilege of seeing how actual\r\nsessions of Congress compared with our college representations.\r\nI discovered that we at college had neglected some of the stage\r\nfurniture--the couches upon which exhausted congressmen took their\r\ndaily siesta.\r\n\r\nTwice I spent Christmas in Skowhegan, Maine, my mother’s old home town\r\nto which she had taken me in my little girl days. Here I found deep\r\nsnows and a temperature forty degrees below, and in my hostess the\r\ntruest embodiment of the Christmas spirit I have ever met.\r\n\r\nA Christmas vacation spent in Boston was one of the most interesting.\r\nA friend and I took a room high up in an old house near Copley\r\nSquare--two girls free to enjoy the city. Among other delights we had\r\na feast of music--the Haydn and Handel Society _Messiah_, a recital\r\ngiven by Paderewski, the new Polish pianist, two symphony concerts,\r\nheard from the twenty-five cent gallery of the old Symphony Hall, the\r\nChristmas music at the Church of the Ascension, and the memorable\r\nwatch-night service, New Year’s Eve, at Trinity Church, when everyone\r\nhoped and no one knew that Phillips Brooks would come. The church was\r\ndim and fragrant with the odor of cedar and pine, and the people were\r\nhushed by the beauty of the ancient ritual. As midnight approached the\r\ngreat figure of the bishop appeared from among the trees of the choir\r\nand mounted the pulpit. Bishop Brooks spoke simply and solemnly and\r\nas the hour struck made a prayer out of his own deep heart. With his\r\nmessage for the New Year we went into an unforgettable, marvellous\r\nnight, with snowy ground, a dark sky filled with fleecy clouds about a\r\nprismed moon. In three weeks the beloved Bishop was dead--a true bishop\r\nof all the people. The knowing of Phillips Brooks was one of the good\r\nthings my years in Wellesley brought me.\r\n\r\nCollege days were over. I was a graduate of Wellesley, with all that\r\nmeant of training, of prestige, of obligation.\r\n\r\nThe four years had been busy and valuable, but they were not the\r\nhappiest days of my life, as school days are often said to be. I was\r\ngoing through a period of re-adjustment and re-valuation that did not\r\nmake for peace of mind. I was often lonely, for, although I had a wide\r\nand pleasant acquaintance, I did not make the intimate friends that I\r\ndid either before or after college days. I have wondered why. Was I so\r\nunsettled that no one me dominated and attracted its own, or was I, the\r\nwestern girl, always something of a stranger in a strange land? It may\r\nhave been better so, since I was to go so far from college haunts and\r\nfriends. The girls at the end sang pensively of Seniors about to be\r\n“lost in the wide, wide world.” I didn’t care or fear. I hastened to be\r\nlost, for the wide, wide world meant California, my homeland, to which\r\nI fled the instant I secured my diploma. The western girl who went East\r\nto college went West to live.\r\n\r\nThe years at Wellesley soon slipped back into the dim region of memory\r\nand Los Angeles became once more the familiar environment of my life.\r\nIt was so good to be at home again--but Time was bringing changes and\r\nnew responsibilities. The family was smaller than it had been, for my\r\nsister had followed me to Wellesley, and my aunt was taking a year-long\r\nvacation in the East, thus giving me a chance to learn by experience\r\nhow to be a house-keeper. I judge that I, the amateur, did not always\r\nreach the usual standard of good order set for our home, for I have a\r\npicture of my father down on his knees at the parlor fireplace, one\r\nevening before dinner when company was expected, carefully wiping the\r\nblower with an oiled rag, while suggesting to me “I think if your Aunt\r\nMarthy were here she would take those newspapers from the shelf under\r\nthe table.” I did not know that he noticed such things. I was a bit\r\nconscience-smitten.\r\n\r\nOur life went on serenely and happily. Daily he went down the hill to\r\nthe company office on First Street, just above Broadway. We filled our\r\nhome time with reading the newspapers, books and magazines especially\r\n_The Forum_, which at that time was very good. I made a final\r\nfruitless attempt to be musical, took a few painting lessons which I\r\nwish had been many, and for a time went to the new Throop Institute in\r\nPasadena, for dressmaking training. I learned how to bone a basque and\r\nline a skirt, and a few other arts now unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday I undertook to hold the attention of half a dozen lively\r\nsmall boys. We liked each other and had a very good time together, but\r\nhow much we learned I cannot say. Perhaps my own sons have profited by\r\nmy acquaintance with those other obstreperous young Americans. I never\r\nwanted to exchange them for the neighboring class of little girls whose\r\nwhispers and giggles were less understandable to me than the excess of\r\nenergy evidenced by punching, pin-sticking, and the tipping over of\r\nchairs.\r\n\r\nNeither father nor I was very demonstrative, but we enjoyed being\r\ntogether as we always had. We went out seldom in the evening as a\r\ngrowing deafness made public meetings of little value to him. But we\r\nnever missed a Maine Society gathering. He had not lost his interest in\r\npeople from the old home state and read the _Great Register_ whenever\r\nit came out, checking off every “Mainiac” and hunting him up when\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nOne evening when a cousin, Frank Weston from Santa Clara, was visiting\r\nus I heard him and father exchanging news of one and another relative\r\nunknown to me, so I asked how many cousins there were; they did not\r\nknow; but father began naming them for me to count. He remembered one\r\nhundred and twenty-five, no seconds being listed. How many first\r\nhe may have missed, I do not know. They all seemed to know him and\r\nwhenever a new one came to California he made for our house. There\r\nwas a certain quality about father that won people. I remember the\r\ntestimony to this that I witnessed about this time when he and I\r\nhad gone to a church supper together. He soon saw a strange, small\r\nbaby whom he borrowed and carried about with him all evening, to the\r\napparent satisfaction of both. It is a pity that his children came so\r\nlate in life that he had no chance to be grandfather to the fifteen\r\ngrandchildren that have accrued since his death.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1896 brought a sudden dismay into our peaceful family.\r\nA telegram from New York City reported the desperate illness of Nan,\r\nwho had gone there for her Easter vacation. Aunt Martha hurried to\r\nher, while we at home for six weeks lived for the daily telegram.\r\nThe anxiety told on father, who was then past seventy. Even after my\r\nsister’s safe return he still seemed weary.\r\n\r\nThat was the summer of the Free Silver campaign, and he was greatly\r\nworried about the outcome and its effect upon his somewhat precarious\r\nbusiness affairs. Even his satisfaction at the defeat of Mr. Bryan was\r\noffset by the strain of an all-night session counting ballots in a cold\r\npolling place, he having been unable to resist the temptation to accept\r\nhis customary position as an election officer of his precinct. With\r\nMcKinley elected and Nan well the world was saved!\r\n\r\nAnd then, early in December, one Saturday evening, he failed to answer\r\nwhen called for dinner. I found him sitting at the old table that\r\nhad come with us from San Justo, his cards spread before him in his\r\naccustomed solitaire, asleep, not to wake for us again,--a beautiful\r\nway to go, no pain, no days of helplessness.\r\n\r\nThis meant the breaking up of the home, for we young folk scattered,\r\nNan to Wellesley to finish her interrupted course, Llewellyn to Pomona\r\nCollege where he had been during the fall, and I to make a new home in\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nSince my marriage I have not lived actually in Los Angeles. For eight\r\nyears, divided between Michigan, Chicago, Honolulu and Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts, my home was outside of California; but even during that\r\ntime I made several visits here so that in all my life from the first\r\ntrip south from San Justo before I was a year old to the present, I\r\nhave never been away from Los Angeles for a period longer than two\r\nyears. Since my return to my own state, twenty-one years ago I have\r\nalways been within hailing distance. I have seen a city increase\r\nand multiply in an amazing manner, even an hundred fold, a strange\r\nexperience for one who has no intention of being old for a long time\r\nyet. Those who realize how this infant prodigy of a town is daily\r\nswamped with hordes of new and unrelated people have patience with\r\nsome things for which she can be justly criticised; they take pride in\r\nthe vigor of her life and have faith that when she really grows up and\r\ndiscovers a co-ordinated spirit to direct her overgrown body, she will\r\nearn a right to her queenly name.\r\n\r\nIt is because these vanished days are so clear to me that I have put\r\ndown some of the things I know for those who care to read, among whom\r\nI hope will be found the thirty grand-children of the Hathaway-Bixby\r\ncouples who have figured in the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe older people who have come into my record are all gone except Aunt\r\nMargaret and Aunt Martha, both well beyond their three score years and\r\nten. They live in Long Beach, the new city on the old ranch barley\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nI began my book with a dedication to my father. I close it with a\r\nloving greeting to my two aunts, the remaining “Hathaway girls;” the\r\none who welcomed me into the world and has been to me always the soul\r\nof generosity and kindness, the other for more than forty years a\r\ndevoted mother to me, a woman of culture and character, whose alert\r\nmind still follows the best thought of the day, and whose big heart\r\nspends itself for the welfare of the oppressed.\r\n\r\nMy aunts, I salute you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\nIllustrations have been moved to paragraph breaks near where they are\r\nmentioned, except for the frontispiece.\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been made consistent.\r\n\r\nVariations in spelling and hyphenation were retained as they appear in\r\nthe original publication, except that obvious typographical errors have\r\nbeen corrected.",
