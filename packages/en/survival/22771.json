Potter and Company,\r\n617 Sansom Street.\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1864, by\r\nJOHN E. POTTER,\r\nIn the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States, in and\r\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA marked interest has of late years been manifested in our country\r\nrelative to the subject of breeding and rearing domestic cattle. This\r\nhas not been confined to the dairyman alone. The greater portion of\r\nintelligent agriculturists have perceived the necessity of paying more\r\nattention than was formerly devoted to the improvement and perfection of\r\nbreeds for the uses of the table as well. In this respect, European\r\ncattle-raisers have long taken the precedence of our own.\r\n\r\nThe gratifying favor with which the author's former publication, \"The\r\nHorse and his Diseases,\" has been received by the public, has induced\r\nhim to believe that a work, similar in spirit and general treatment,\r\nupon Cattle, would not be without interest for the agricultural\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIn this belief, the present treatise has been prepared. The author has\r\navailed himself of the labors of others in this connection; never,\r\nhowever, adopting results and conclusions, no matter how strongly\r\nendorsed, which have been contradicted by his own observation and\r\nexperience. In a field like the one in question, assuredly, if anywhere,\r\nsome degree of independent judgment will not be censured by those who\r\nare familiar with the sad consequences resulting from the attempted\r\napplication of theories now universally exploded, but which in the day\r\nand generation of their originators were sanctioned and advocated by\r\nthose who claimed to be magnates in this department.\r\n\r\nTo the following works, especially, the author acknowledges himself\r\nindebted: American Farmer's Encyclopædia; Stephens's Book of the Farm;\r\nFlint's Milch-Cows and Dairy Farming; Laurence on Cattle; Allen's\r\nDomestic Animals; Youatt and Martin on Cattle; Thomson's Food of\r\nAnimals; Allen's Rural Architecture; Colman's Practical Agriculture and\r\nRural Economy; Goodale's Breeding of Domestic Animals; and Prof.\r\nGamgee's valuable contributions to veterinary science.\r\n\r\nParticular attention is requested to the division of \"Diseases.\" Under\r\nthis head, as in his former work, the author has endeavored to detail\r\nthe symptoms of the most common ailments of cattle in such a manner that\r\nevery farmer and cattle-owner can at once understand them, and also to\r\nsuggest such procurable remedies as a wide experience has proved to be\r\nmost efficacious.\r\n\r\nA generous space has been devoted to the consideration of that fatal\r\nepidemic, now generally known as \"Pleuro-Pneumonia,\" as it has\r\nmanifested itself in Europe and this country, in the belief that a\r\nmatter of such vital importance to the stock-raiser ought to receive a\r\ncomplete exposition in a work like the present. As the author's personal\r\nexperience in connection with the treatment of this peculiar disease has\r\nbeen, perhaps, as large and varied as that of any American practitioner,\r\nhe is not without the hope that his views upon the matter may prove\r\nproductive of some benefit to others.\r\n\r\nShould the present volume prove as acceptable to those interested as did\r\nhis former work, the author will be abundantly satisfied that he has not\r\nmistaken in this instance the wants of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND BREEDS OF CATTLE,

313\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHistory and Breeds\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that the ox has been domesticated and in the service\r\nof man from a very remote period. We are informed in the fourth chapter\r\nof Genesis, that cattle were kept by the early descendants of Adam;\r\nJubal, the son of Lamech--who was probably born during the lifetime of\r\nAdam--being styled the father of such as have cattle. The ox having been\r\npreserved by Noah from the flood of waters, the original breed of our\r\npresent cattle must have been in the neighborhood of Mount Ararat. From\r\nthence, dispersing over the face of the globe--altering by climate, by\r\nfood, and by cultivation--originated the various breeds of modern ages.\r\n\r\nThat the value of the ox tribe has been in all ages and climates highly\r\nappreciated, we have ample evidence. The natives of Egypt, India, and\r\nHindostan, seem alike to have placed the cow amongst their deities; and,\r\njudging by her usefulness to all classes, no animal could perhaps have\r\nbeen selected whose value to mankind is greater. The traditions, indeed,\r\nof every Celtic nation enroll the cow among the earliest productions,\r\nand represent it as a kind of divinity.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all parts of the earth cattle are employed for their labor,\r\nfor their milk, and for food. In southern Africa they are as much the\r\nassociates of the Caffre as the horse is of the Arab. They share his\r\ntoils, and assist him in tending his herds. They are even trained to\r\nbattle, in which they become fierce and courageous. In central Africa\r\nthe proudest ebony beauties are to be seen upon the backs of cattle. In\r\nall ages they have drawn the plough. In Spain they still trample out the\r\ncorn; in India they raise the water from the deepest wells to irrigate\r\nthe thirsty soil of Bengal. When Cæsar invaded Britain they constituted\r\nthe chief riches of its inhabitants; and they still form no\r\ninconsiderable item in the estimate of that country's riches.\r\n\r\nThe parent race of the ox is said to have been much larger than any of\r\nthe present varieties. The Urus, in his wild state at least, was an\r\nenormous and fierce animal, and ancient legends have thrown around him\r\nan air of mystery. In almost every part of the continent of Europe and\r\nin every district of England, skulls, evidently belonging to cattle,\r\nhave been found, far exceeding in bulk any now known.\r\n\r\nAs the various breeds of cattle among us were introduced into this\r\ncountry from Great Britain, we propose, before going into the details of\r\nthe leading American breeds, to glance somewhat briefly at the history\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH OX.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest and most reliable accounts which we possess of the\r\nBritish Isles--the Commentaries of Cæsar--we learn that the ancient\r\nBritons possessed great numbers of cattle. No satisfactory description\r\nof these cattle occurs in any ancient author; but, with occasional\r\nexceptions, we know that they possessed no great bulk or beauty. Cæsar\r\ntells us that the Britons neglected tillage and lived on milk and flesh;\r\nand this account of the early inhabitants of the British Isle is\r\ncorroborated by other authors. It was such an occupation and mode of\r\nlife as suited their state of society. The island was divided into many\r\nlittle sovereignties; no fixed property was secure; and that alone was\r\nvaluable which could be hurried away at the threatened approach of the\r\ninvader. Many centuries after this, when--although one sovereign seemed\r\nto reign paramount over the whole of the kingdom--there continued to be\r\nendless contests among the feudal barons, and therefore that property\r\nalone continued to be valuable which could be secured within the walls\r\nof the castle, or driven beyond the assailant's reach--an immense stock\r\nof provisions was always stored up in the various fortresses, both for\r\nthe vassals and the cattle; or it was contrived that the latter should\r\nbe driven to the domains of some friendly baron, or concealed in some\r\ninland recess.\r\n\r\nWhen the government became more powerful and settled, and property of\r\nevery kind was assured a proportionate degree of protection, as well as\r\nmore equally divided, the plough came into use; agricultural productions\r\nwere oftener cultivated, the reaping of which was sure after the labor\r\nof sowing. Cattle were then comparatively neglected and for some\r\ncenturies injuriously so. Their numbers diminished, and their size also\r\nseems to have diminished; and it is only within the last century and a\r\nhalf that any serious and successful efforts have been made materially\r\nto improve them.\r\n\r\nIn the comparatively roving and uncertain life which the earlier\r\ninhabitants led, their cattle would sometimes stray and be lost. The\r\ncountry was at that time overgrown with forests, and the beasts betook\r\nthemselves to the recesses of these woods, and became wild and sometimes\r\nferocious. They, by degrees, grew so numerous as to be dangerous to the\r\ninhabitants of the neighboring districts. One of the chronicles asserts\r\nthat many of them harbored in the forests in the neighborhood of London.\r\nStrange stories are told of some of them, and, doubtless, when\r\nirritated, they were fierce and dangerous enough. As, however,\r\ncivilization advanced, and the forests became thinned and contracted,\r\nthese animals were seen more rarely, and at length almost disappeared. A\r\nfew of them, however, are still to be found in the parks of some of the\r\nleading English noblemen, who keep them for ornament and as curiosities.\r\n\r\nThe color of this wild breed is invariably white, the muzzle being\r\nblack; the whole of the inside of the ear, and about one-third of the\r\noutside, from the tips downward, red; horns white, with black tips, very\r\nfine, and bent upward; some of the bulls have a thin, upright mane,\r\nabout an inch and a half or two inches long. The beef is finely marbled\r\nand of excellent flavor.\r\n\r\nAt the first appearance of any person they set off in full gallop, and\r\nat the distance of about two hundred yards, make a wheel around and come\r\nboldly up again in a menacing manner; on a sudden they make a full stop\r\nat the distance of forty or fifty yards, looking wildly at the object of\r\ntheir surprise; but upon the least motion they all again turn round and\r\nfly off with equal speed, but not to the same distance, forming a\r\nshorter circle; and, again returning with a more threatening aspect than\r\nbefore, they approach probably within thirty yards, when they again make\r\nanother stand, and then fly off; this they do several times, shortening\r\ntheir distance and advancing nearer and nearer, till they come within\r\nsuch short distance that most persons think it prudent to leave them.\r\n\r\nWhen the cows calve, they hide their calves for a week or ten days in\r\nsome retired situation, and go and suckle them two or three times a day.\r\nIf any persons come near the calves they clap their heads close to the\r\nground to hide themselves--a proof of their native wildness. The dams\r\nallow no one to touch their young without attacking with impetuous\r\nferocity. When one of the herd happens to be wounded, or has grown weak\r\nand feeble through age or sickness, the rest set on it and gore it to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe breeds of cattle which are now found in Great Britain, are almost as\r\nvarious as the soil of the different districts or the fancies of the\r\nbreeders. They have, however, been very conveniently classed according\r\nto the comparative size of the horns; the _long-horns_, originally from\r\nLancashire, and established through most of the midland counties; the\r\n_short-horns_, generally cultivated in the northern counties and in\r\nLincolnshire, and many of them found in every part of the kingdom where\r\nthe farmer pays much attention to his dairy, or where a large supply of\r\nmilk is desired; and the _middle-horns_, a distinct and valuable breed,\r\ninhabiting, principally, the north of Devon, the east of Sussex,\r\nHerefordshire, and Gloucestershire; and of diminished bulk and with\r\nsomewhat different character, the cattle of the Scottish and Welsh\r\nmountains. The Alderney, with its _crumpled horn_, is found on the\r\nsouthern coast; while the polled, or _hornless_, cattle prevail in\r\nSuffolk, Norfolk, and Galloway, whence they were first derived.\r\n\r\nThese leading breeds, however, have been intermingled in every possible\r\nway. They are found pure only in their native districts, or on the\r\nestate of some wealthy and spirited individuals. Each county has its own\r\nmongrel breed, often difficult to be described, and not always to be\r\ntraced--neglected enough, yet suited to the soil and the climate; and\r\namong small farmers, maintaining their station, in spite of attempts at\r\nimprovements by the intermixture or the substitution of foreign\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nMuch dispute has arisen as to the original breed of British cattle. The\r\nbattle has been sharply fought between the advocates of the middle and\r\nof the long-horns. The short-horns and the polls are out of the lists;\r\nthe latter, although it has existed in certain districts from time\r\nimmemorial, being probably an accidental variety. The weight of\r\nargument appears at present to rest with the middle horns; the\r\nlong-horns being evidently of Irish extraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WELL-FED BEASTS.]\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has shared the fate of other nations, and oftener than\r\nthey been overrun and subjugated by invaders. As the natives retreated\r\nthey carried with them some portion of their property, consisting, in\r\nthe remote and early times, principally of cattle. They drove along with\r\nthem as many as they could, when they retired to the fortresses of North\r\nDevon and Cornwall, or the mountainous region of Wales, or when they\r\ntook refuge in the retirement of East Sussex; and there, retaining all\r\ntheir prejudices, manners, and customs, were jealous of the preservation\r\nof that which reminded them of their native country before it yielded to\r\na foreign yoke.\r\n\r\nIn this way was preserved the ancient breed of British cattle.\r\nDifference of climate produced some change, particularly in their bulk.\r\nThe rich pasturage of Sussex fattened the ox into its superior size and\r\nweight. The plentiful, but not so luxuriant, herbage of the north of\r\nDevon produced a smaller and more active animal; while the privations of\r\nWales lessened the bulk and thickened the hide of the Welsh Stock. As\r\nfor Scotland, it set its invaders at defiance; or its inhabitants\r\nretreated for a while, and soon turned again on their pursuers. They\r\nwere proud of their country, and of their cattle, their choicest\r\npossession; and there, also, the cattle were preserved, unmixed and\r\nundegenerated.\r\n\r\nThence it has resulted, that in Devon, in Sussex, in Wales, and in\r\nScotland, the cattle have been the same from time immemorial; while in\r\nall the eastern coasts and through every district of England, the breed\r\nof cattle degenerated, or lost its original character; it consisted of\r\nanimals brought from all the neighboring, and some remote districts,\r\nmingled in every possible variety, yet conforming to the soil and the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nCareful observations will establish the fact, that the cattle in\r\nDevonshire, Sussex, Wales, and Scotland are essentially the same. They\r\nare middle horned; not extraordinary milkers, and remarkable for the\r\nquality rather than the quantity of their milk; active at work, and with\r\nan unequalled aptitude to fatten. They have all the characters of the\r\nsame breed, changed by soil, climate, and time, yet little changed by\r\nman. The color, even, may be almost traced, namely: the red of the\r\nDevon, the Sussex, and the Hereford; and where only the black are now\r\nfound, the recollection of the red prevails.\r\n\r\nAs this volume is intended especially for the farmers of our own\r\ncountry, it is deemed unnecessary in this connection to present any\r\nthing additional under the present head, except the names of the\r\nprominent species of British cattle. These are, commencing with the\r\nmiddle horns, the North Devon, the Hereford, the Sussex, the Welsh (with\r\nthe varieties of the Pembrokeshire, the Glamorganshire, the Radnor\r\nblack, the Anglesea and some others); and the Scotch with its chief\r\nvarieties, the West Highlanders, the North Highlanders, the North\r\nEastern, the Fife, the Ayrshire, and the Galloways.\r\n\r\nAs to the long horns, which came originally from Craven in Yorkshire, it\r\nmay be remarked that this breed has been rapidly disappearing of late,\r\nand has everywhere given place to better kinds. Of this species there\r\nare--or perhaps were--two leading classes, the Lancashire and the\r\nLeicestershire improved.\r\n\r\nOf the short horns, the leading breeds are the Dutch, the Holderness,\r\nthe Teeswater, the Yorkshire, the Durham, the Northumberland, and some\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN CATTLE.\r\n\r\nThe breeds of cattle which stock the farms of the United States are all\r\nderived from Europe, and, with few exceptions, from Great Britain. The\r\nhighest breeds at the present time are of comparatively recent origin,\r\nsince the great improvements in breeding were only commenced at about\r\nthe period of the American Revolution. The old importations made by the\r\nearly settlers, must consequently have been from comparatively inferior\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the Union, and more particularly in New England, the\r\nprimitive stock is thought to have undergone considerable improvement;\r\nwhilst in many parts of the Middle, and especially of the Southern\r\nStates, a greater or less depreciation has ensued. The prevailing stock\r\nin the Eastern States is believed to be derived from the North Devons,\r\nmost of the excellent marks and qualities of which they possess. For\r\nthis reason they are very highly esteemed, and have been frequently\r\ncalled the American Devon. The most valuable working oxen are chiefly of\r\nthis breed, which also contributes so largely to the best displays of\r\nbeef found in the markets of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. By\r\nmeans of this domestic stock, and the importations still extensively\r\nmade of selections from the short horns, and others of the finest\r\nEuropean breeds, the cattle, not only of New England, but of other\r\nsections, are rapidly improving, especially in the Middle and Western\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA brief sketch of the principal breeds of American cattle, as well as of\r\nthe grades or common stock of the country, will be of service to the\r\nfarmer in making an intelligent selection with reference to the special\r\nobject of pursuit--whether it be the dairy, the production of beef, or\r\nthe raising of cattle for work.\r\n\r\nIn selecting any breed, regard should be had to the circumstances of the\r\nindividual farmer and the object to be pursued. The cow most profitable\r\nfor the milk dairy, may be very unprofitable in the butter and cheese\r\ndairy, as well as for the production of beef; while, for either of the\r\nlatter objects, the cow which gave the largest quantity of milk might be\r\nvery undesirable. A union and harmony of all good qualities must be\r\nsecured, so far as possible. The farmer wants a cow that will milk well\r\nfor some years; and then, when dry, fatten readily and sell to the\r\nbutcher for the highest price. These qualities, often supposed to be\r\nutterly incompatible, will be found united in some breeds to a greater\r\nextent than in others; while some peculiarities of form have been\r\nfound, by observation, to be better adapted to the production of milk\r\nand beef than others.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed, therefore, to sketch the pure breeds now found in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AYRSHIRE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AYRSHIRE BULL.]\r\n\r\nThis breed is justly celebrated throughout Great Britain and this\r\ncountry for its excellent dairy qualities. Though the most recent in\r\ntheir origin, they are pretty distinct from the Scotch and English\r\nraces. In color, the pure Ayrshires are generally red and\r\nwhite, spotted or mottled, not roan like many of the short horns, but\r\noften presenting a bright contrast of colors. They are sometimes, though\r\nrarely, nearly or quite all red, and sometimes black and white; but the\r\nfavorite color is red and white brightly contrasted; and, by some,\r\nstrawberry-color is preferred. The head is small, fine and clean; the\r\nface long and narrow at the muzzle, with a sprightly, yet generally mild\r\nexpression; eye small, smart and lively; the horns short, fine, and\r\nslightly twisted upward, set wide apart at the roots; the neck thin;\r\nbody enlarging from fore to hind quarters; the back straight and narrow,\r\nbut broad across the loin; joints rather loose and open; ribs rather\r\nflat; hind quarters rather thin; bone fine; tail long, fine, and bushy\r\nat the end; hair generally thin and soft; udder light color and\r\ncapacious, extending well forward under the belly; teats of the cow of\r\nmedium size, generally set regularly and wide apart; milk-veins\r\nprominent and well developed. The carcass of the pure bred Ayrshire is\r\nlight, particularly the fore quarters, which is considered by good\r\njudges as an index of great milking qualities; but the pelvis is\r\ncapacious and wide over the hips.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the Ayrshire is good looking, but wants some of the\r\nsymmetry and aptitude to fatten which characterize the short horn, which\r\nis supposed to have contributed to build up this valuable breed on the\r\nbasis of the original stock of the county of Ayr, which extends along\r\nthe eastern shore of the Firth of Clyde, in the southwestern part of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThe original stock of this country are described as of a diminutive\r\nsize, ill fed, ill shaped, and yielding but a scanty return in milk.\r\nThey were mostly of a black color, with large stripes of white along the\r\nchine and ridge of their backs, about the flanks, and on their faces.\r\nTheir horns were high and crooked, having deep ringlets at the root--the\r\nsurest proof that they were but scantily fed; the chine of their backs\r\nstood up high and narrow; their sides were lank, short, and thin; their\r\nhides thick and adhering to the bones; their pile was coarse and open;\r\nand few of them gave more than six or eight quarts of milk a day when in\r\ntheir best condition, or weighed, when fat, more than from a hundred to\r\na hundred and sixty pounds avoirdupois, rejecting offal.\r\n\r\nA wonderful change has since been made in the condition, aspect, and\r\nqualities of the Ayrshire dairy stock. They are now almost double the\r\nsize, and yield about four times the quantity of milk that the Ayrshire\r\ncows formerly yielded. A large part of this improvement is due to better\r\nfeeding and care, but much, no doubt, to judicious crossing. Strange as\r\nit may seem, considering the modern origin of this breed, all that is\r\ncertainly known touching it is, that about a century and a half ago\r\nthere was no such breed as Ayrshire in Scotland. The question has\r\ntherefore arisen, whether these cattle came entirely from a careful\r\nselection of the best native breed. If they did, it is a circumstance\r\nwithout a parallel in the history of agriculture. The native breed may\r\nindeed be ameliorated by careful selection; its value may be\r\nincalculably increased; some good qualities, some of its best qualities,\r\nmay be developed for the first time; but yet there will be some\r\nresemblance to the original stock, and the more the animal is examined,\r\nthe more clearly can be traced the characteristic points of the\r\nancestor, although every one of them is improved.\r\n\r\nYouatt estimates the daily yield of an Ayrshire cow, for the first two\r\nor three months after calving, at five gallons a day, on an average; for\r\nthe next three months, at three gallons; and for the next four months,\r\nat one gallon and a half. This would give eight hundred and fifty\r\ngallons as the annual average; but, allowing for some unproductive cows,\r\nhe estimates the average of a dairy at six hundred gallons a year for\r\neach cow. Three gallons and a half of the Ayrshire cow's milk will yield\r\none and a half pounds of butter. Some have estimated the yield still\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nOne of the four cows originally imported into this country by John P.\r\nCushing, Esq., of Massachusetts, gave in one year three thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-four quarts, beer measure, or about nine hundred and\r\nsixty-six gallons, at ten pounds the gallon; being an average of over\r\nten and a half beer quarts a day for the entire year. The first cow of\r\nthis breed, imported by the Massachusetts Society, for the Promotion of\r\nAgriculture, in 1837, yielded sixteen pounds of butter a week for\r\nseveral successive weeks, on grass feed only. It should be borne in\r\nmind, in this connection that the climate of New England is less\r\nfavorable to the production of milk than that of England and Scotland,\r\nand that no cow imported after arriving at maturity can be expected to\r\nyield as much, under the same circumstances, as one bred on the spot\r\nwhere the trial is made, and perfectly acclimated.\r\n\r\nOn excellent authority, the most approved shape and marks of a good\r\ndairy cow are as follows: Head small, long, and narrow toward the\r\nmuzzle; horns small, clear, bent, and placed at considerable distance\r\nfrom each other; eyes not large, but brisk and lively; neck slender and\r\nlong, tapering toward the head, with a little loose skin below;\r\nshoulders and fore quarters light and thin; hind quarters large and\r\nbroad; back straight, and joints slack and open; carcass deep in the\r\nrib; tail small and long, reaching to the heels; legs small and short,\r\nwith firm joints; udder square, but a little oblong, stretching forward,\r\nthin skinned and capacious, but not low hung; teats or paps small,\r\npointing outward, and at a considerable distance from each other;\r\nmilk-veins capacious and prominent; skin loose, thin, and soft like a\r\nglove; hair short, soft, and woolly; general figure, when in flesh,\r\nhandsome and well proportioned.\r\n\r\nIf this description of the Ayrshire cow be correct, it will be seen that\r\nher head and neck are remarkably clean and fine, the latter swelling\r\ngradually toward the shoulders, both parts being unencumbered with\r\nsuperfluous flesh. The same general form extends backward, the fore\r\nquarters being, light the shoulders thin, and the carcass swelling out\r\ntoward the hind quarters, so that when standing in front of her it has\r\nthe form of a blunted wedge. Such a structure indicates very fully\r\ndeveloped digestive organs, which exert a powerful influence on all the\r\nfunctions of the body, and especially on the secretion of the milky\r\nglands, accompanied with milk-veins and udder partaking of the same\r\ncharacter as the stomach and viscera, being large and capacious, while\r\nthe external skin and interior walls of the milk-glands are thin and\r\nelastic, and all parts arranged in a manner especially adapted for the\r\nproduction of milk.\r\n\r\nA cow with these marks will generally be of a quiet and docile temper,\r\nwhich greatly increases her value. A cow that is of a quiet and\r\ncontented disposition feeds at ease, is milked with ease, and yields\r\nmore than one of an opposite temperament; while, after she is past her\r\nusefulness as a milker, she will easily take on fat, and make fine beef\r\nand a good quantity of tallow, because she feeds freely, and when dry\r\nthe food which went to make milk is converted into fat and flesh. But\r\nthere is no breed of cows with which gentle gentleness of treatment is\r\nso indispensable as with the Ayrshire, on account of her naturally\r\nnervous temperament. If she receives other than kind and gentle\r\ntreatment, she will often resent it with angry looks and gestures, and\r\nwithhold her milk; and if such treatment is long continued, will dry\r\nup; but she willingly and easily yields it to the hand that fondles\r\nher, and all her looks and movements toward her friends are quiet and\r\nmild.\r\n\r\nThe Ayrshires in their native country are generally bred for the dairy,\r\nand for no other object; and the cows have justly obtained a world-wide\r\nreputation for this quality. The oxen are, however, very fair as working\r\ncattle, though they cannot be said to excel other breeds in this\r\nrespect. The Ayrshire steer maybe fed and turned at three years old; but\r\nfor feeding purposes the Ayrshires are greatly improved by a cross with\r\nthe short horns, provided regard is had to the size of the animal. It is\r\nthe opinion of good breeders that a high-bred short horn bull and a\r\nlarge-sized Ayrshire cow will produce a calf which will come to maturity\r\nearlier, and attain greater weight, and sell for more money than a\r\npure-bred Ayrshire. This cross, with feeding from the start, may be sold\r\nfat at two or three years old, the improvement being most noticeable in\r\nthe earlier maturity and size.\r\n\r\nIn the Cross with the short horn, the form ordinarily becomes more\r\nsymmetrical, while there is, perhaps, little risk of lessening the\r\nmilking qualities of the offspring, if sufficient regard is paid to the\r\nselection of the individual animals to breed from. It is thought by some\r\nthat in the breeding of animals it is the male which gives the external\r\nform, or the bony and muscular system of the young, while the female\r\nimparts the respiratory organs, the circulation of the blood, the organs\r\nof secretion, and the like.\r\n\r\nIf this principle be true, it follows that the milking qualities come\r\nchiefly from the mother, and that the bull cannot materially alter the\r\nconditions which determine the transmission of these qualities,\r\nespecially when they are as strongly marked as they are in this breed.\r\n\r\nUntil, however, certain mooted questions connected with breeding are\r\ndefinitively settled, it is the safest plan, in breeding for the dairy,\r\nto adhere to the rule of selecting only animals whose progenitors on\r\nboth sides have been distinguished for their milking qualities.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated, in conclusion, that for purely dairy purposes the\r\nAyrshire cow deserves the first place. In consequence of her small,\r\nsymmetrical, and compact body, combined with a well-formed chest and a\r\ncapacious stomach, there is little waste, comparatively speaking,\r\nthrough the respiratory system; while at the same time there is very\r\ncomplete assimilation of the food, and thus she converts a very large\r\nproportion of her food into milk. So remarkable is this fact, that all\r\ndairy farmers who have any experience on the point, agree in stating\r\nthat _an Ayrshire cow generally gives a larger return of milk for the\r\nfood consumed than a cow of any other breed_. The absolute quality may\r\nnot be so great, but it is obtained at a less cost; and this is the\r\npoint upon which the question of profit depends. The best milkers which\r\nhave been known in this country were grade Ayrshires, larger in size\r\nthan the pure bloods, but still sufficiently high grades to give certain\r\nsigns of their origin. This grade would seem to possess the advantage of\r\ncombining, to some extent, the two qualities of milking and adaptation\r\nto beef; and this is no small recommendation of the stock to farmers\r\nsituated as American farmers are, who wish for milk for some years and\r\nthen to turn over to the butcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JERSEY.\r\n\r\nThese cattle are now widely known in this country. Many of them have\r\nbeen imported from an island of the same name in the British Channel,\r\nnear the coast of France, and they may now be considered, for all\r\npractical purposes, as fully acclimated. They were first introduced,\r\nupward of thirty years ago, from the channel islands, Alderney,\r\nGuernsey, and Jersey.\r\n\r\nThis race is supposed to have been originally derived from Normandy, in\r\nthe northern part of France. The cows have been long celebrated for the\r\nproduction of very rich milk and cream, but till within the last\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years they were comparatively coarse, ugly, and\r\nill-shaped. Improvements have been very marked, but the form of the\r\nanimal is still far from satisfying the eye.\r\n\r\nThe head of the pure Jersey is fine and tapering, the cheek small, the\r\nthroat clean, the muzzle fine and encircled with a light stripe, the\r\nnostril high and open; the horns smooth, crumpled, but not very thick at\r\nthe base, tapering and tipped with black; ears small and thin, deep\r\norange color inside; eyes full and placid; neck straight and fine; chest\r\nbroad and deep; barrel hoofed, broad and deep, well ribbed up; back\r\nstraight from the withers to the hip, and from the top of the hip to the\r\nsetting of the tail; tail fine, at right angles with the back, and\r\nhanging down to the hocks; skin thin, light color, and mellow, covered\r\nwith fine soft hair; fore legs short, straight and fine below the knee,\r\narm swelling and full above; hind quarters long and well filled; hind\r\nlegs short and straight below the hocks, with bones rather fine,\r\nsquarely placed, and not too close together; hoofs small; udder full in\r\nsize, in line with the belly, extending well up behind; teats of medium\r\nsize, squarely placed and wide apart, and milk-veins very prominent. The\r\ncolor is generally cream, dun, or yellow, with more or less of white,\r\nand the fine head and neck give the cows and heifers a fawn-like\r\nappearance, and make them objects of attraction in the park; but the\r\nhind quarters are often too narrow to work well, particularly to those\r\nwho judge animals by the amount of fat which they carry.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind, however, that a good race of animals is not\r\nalways the most beautiful, as that term is generally understood. Beauty\r\nin stock has no invariable standard. In the estimation of some, it\r\nresults mainly from fine forms, small bones, and close, compact frames;\r\nwhile others consider that structure the most perfect, and therefore the\r\nmost beautiful, which is best adapted to the use for which it is\r\ndestined. With such, beauty is relative. It is not the same in an animal\r\ndesigned for beef and in one designed for the dairy or for work. The\r\nbeauty of a milch cow is the result of her good qualities. Large milkers\r\nare very rarely cows that please the eye of any but a skillful judge.\r\nThey are generally poor, since their food goes mainly to the production\r\nof milk, and because they are selected with less regard to form than to\r\ngood milking qualities. The prevailing opinion as to the beauty of the\r\nJersey, is based on the general appearance of the cow when in milk--no\r\nexperiments in feeding exclusively for beef having been made public,\r\nand no opportunity to form a correct judgment from actual observation\r\nhaving been furnished; and it must be confessed that the general\r\nappearance of the breed would amply justify the hasty conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe bulls are usually very different in character and disposition from\r\nthe cows, and are much inclined to become restive and cross at the age\r\nof two or three years, unless their treatment is uniformly gentle and\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nThe Jersey is to be regarded as a dairy breed, and that almost\r\nexclusively. It would not be sought for large dairies kept for the\r\nsupply of milk to cities; for, though the quality would gratify the\r\ncustomer, the quantity would not satisfy the owner. The place of the\r\nJersey cow is rather in private establishments, where the supply of\r\ncream and butter is a sufficient object; or, in limited numbers, to add\r\nrichness to the milk of large butter dairies. Even one or two good\r\nJersey cows with a herd of fifteen or twenty, will make a great\r\ndifference in the quality of the milk and butter of the whole\r\nestablishment; and they would probably be profitable for this, if for no\r\nother object.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHORT HORNS.\r\n\r\nNo breed of cattle has commanded more universal admiration during the\r\nlast half century than the improved short horns, whose origin can be\r\ntraced back for nearly a hundred years. According to the best\r\nauthorities, the stock which formed the basis of improvement existed\r\nequally in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Northumberland, and the adjoining\r\ncounties; and the pre-eminence was accorded to Durham, which gave its\r\nname to the race, from the more correct principles of breeding which\r\nseem to have obtained there.\r\n\r\nThere is a dispute among the most eminent breeders as to how far it owes\r\nits origin to early importations from Holland, whence many superior\r\nanimals were brought for the purpose of improving the old long horned\r\nbreed. A large race of cattle had existed for many years on the western\r\nshores of the continent of Europe. As early as 1633, they were imported\r\nfrom Denmark into New England in considerable numbers, and thus laid the\r\nfoundation of a valuable stock in farming at a very early date in\r\nHolland, and experience led to the greatest care in the choice and\r\nbreeding of dairy stock. From these cattle many selections were made to\r\ncross over to the counties of York and Durham. The prevailing color of\r\nthe large Dutch cattle was black and white, beautifully contrasted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SHORT HORN BULL.]\r\n\r\nThe cattle produced by these crosses a century ago were known by the\r\nname of \"Dutch.\" The cows selected for crossing with the early imported\r\nDutch bulls were generally long horned, large boned, coarse animals, a\r\nfair type of which was found in the old \"Holderness\" breed of\r\nYorkshire--slow feeders, strong in the shoulder, defective in the fore\r\nquarter, and not very profitable to the butcher, their meat being coarse\r\nand uninviting. Their milking qualities were good, surpassing those,\r\nprobably, of the improved short horns. Whatever may be the truth with\r\nregard to these crosses, and however far they proved effective in\r\ncreating or laying the foundation of the modern improved short horns,\r\nthe results of the efforts made in Yorkshire and some of the adjoining\r\ncounties were never so satisfactory to the best judges as those of the\r\nbreeders along the Tees, who selected animals with greater reference to\r\nfineness of bone and symmetry of form, and the animals they bred soon\r\ntook the lead and excited great emulation in improvement.\r\n\r\nImportations of short horns have been frequent and extensive into the\r\nUnited States within the last few years, and this famous breed is now\r\npretty generally diffused over the country.\r\n\r\nThe high-bred short horn is easily prepared for a show, and, as fat will\r\ncover faults, the temptation is often too great to be resisted; and\r\nhence it is not uncommon to see the finest animals rendered unfit for\r\nbreeding purposes by over-feeding. The race is susceptible of breeding\r\nfor the production of milk, as several families show, and great milkers\r\nhave often been known among pure-bred animals; but it is more common to\r\nfind it bred mainly for the butcher, and kept accordingly. It is,\r\nhowever, a well-known fact, that the dairies of London are stocked\r\nchiefly with short horns and Yorkshires, or high grades between them,\r\nwhich, after being milked as long as profitable, feed equal, or nearly\r\nso, to pure-bred short horns. It has been said, by very good authority,\r\nthat the short horns improve every breed with which they cross.\r\n\r\nThe desirable characteristics of the short horn bull may be summed up,\r\naccording to the judgment of the best breeders, as follows: He should\r\nhave a short but fine head, very broad across the eyes, tapering to the\r\nnose, with a nostril full and prominent; the nose itself should be of a\r\nrich flesh color; eyes bright and mild; ears somewhat large and thin;\r\nhorns slightly covered and rather flat, well set on; a long, broad,\r\nmuscular neck; chest wide, deep, and projecting; shoulders fine,\r\noblique, well formed into the chine; fore legs short, with upper arm\r\nlarge and powerful; barrel round, deep, well-ribbed horns; hips wide and\r\nlevel; back straight from the withers to the setting on of the tail, but\r\nshort from hips to chine; skin soft and velvety to the touch; moderately\r\nthick hair, plentiful, soft, and mossy. The cow has the same points in\r\nthe main, but her head is finer, longer, and more tapering; neck thinner\r\nand lighter, and shoulders more narrow across the chine.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing precocity of the short horns, their remarkable aptitude\r\nto fatten, the perfection of their forms, and the fineness of their bony\r\nstructure, give them an advantage over most other races when the object\r\nof breeding is for the shambles. No animal of any other breed can so\r\nrapidly transform the stock of any section around him as the improved\r\nshort horn bull.\r\n\r\nIt does not, however, follow that the high-bred short horns are\r\nunexceptionable, even for beef. The very exaggeration, so to speak, of\r\nthe qualities which make them so valuable for the improvement of other\r\nand less perfect races, may become a fault when wanted for the table.\r\nThe very rapidity with which they increase in size is thought by some\r\nto prevent their meat from ripening up sufficiently before being hurried\r\noff to the butcher. The disproportion of the fatty to the muscular\r\nflesh, found in this to a greater extent than in races coming more\r\nslowly to maturity, makes the meat of the thorough-bred short horn, in\r\nthe estimation of some, less agreeable to the taste, and less profitable\r\nto the consumer; since the nitrogenous compounds, true sources of\r\nnutriment, are found in less quantity than in the meat of animals not so\r\nhighly bred.\r\n\r\nIn sections where the climate is moist, and the food abundant and rich,\r\nsome families of the short horns may be valuable for the dairy; but they\r\nare most frequently bred exclusively for beef in this country, and in\r\nsections where they have attained the highest perfection of form and\r\nbeauty, so little is thought of their milking qualities that they are\r\noften not milked at all, the calf being allowed to run with the dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH.\r\n\r\nThis short horned race, in the opinion of many--as has been previously\r\nremarked--contributed largely, about a century ago, to build up the\r\nDurham or Teeswater stock. It has been bred with special reference to\r\ndairy qualities, and is eminently adapted to supply the wants of the\r\ndairy farmer. The cows of North Holland not only give a large quantity,\r\nbut also a very good quality, so that a yield of sixteen to twenty-five\r\nquarts, wine measure, at every milking, is not rare.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which the inhabitants of Holland practise, in\r\nselecting a cow from which to breed, are as follows: She should have,\r\nthey say, considerable size--not less than four and a half or five feet\r\ngirth, with a length of body corresponding; legs proportionally short; a\r\nfinely formed head, with a forehead or face somewhat concave; clear,\r\nlarge, mild and sparkling eyes, yet with no expression of wildness;\r\ntolerably large and stout ears, standing out from the head; fine, well\r\ncurved horns; a rather short, than long, thick, broad neck, well set\r\nagainst the chest and withers; the front part of the breast and\r\nshoulders must be broad and fleshy; the low-hanging dewlap must be soft\r\nto the touch; the back and loins must be properly projected, somewhat\r\nbroad, the bones not too sharp, but well covered with flesh; the animal\r\nshould have long curved ribs, which form a broad breast bone; the body\r\nmust be round and deep, but not sunken into a hanging belly; the rump\r\nmust not be uneven, the hip-bones should not stand out too broad and\r\nspreading, but all the parts should be level and well filled up; a fine\r\ntail, set moderately high up and tolerably long, but slender, with a\r\nthick, bushy tuft of hair at the end, hanging down below the hocks; the\r\nlegs must be short and low, but strong in the bony structure; the knees\r\nbroad, with flexible joints; the muscles and sinews must be firm and\r\nsound, the hoofs broad and flat, and the position of the legs natural,\r\nnot too close and crowded; the hide, covered with fine glossy hair, must\r\nbe soft and mellow to the touch, and set loose upon the body. A large,\r\nrather long, white and loose udder, extending well back, with four long\r\nteats, serves also as a characteristic mark of a good milch cow. Large\r\nand prominent milk-veins must extend from the navel back to the udder;\r\nthe belly of a good milch cow should not be too deep and hanging. The\r\ncolor of the North Dutch cattle is mostly variegated. Cows with only one\r\ncolor are no favorites. Red or black variegated, gray and blue\r\nvariegated, roan, spotted and white variegated cows, are especially\r\nliked.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEREFORD.\r\n\r\nThese cattle derive their name from a county in the western part of\r\nEngland. Their general characteristics are a white face, sometimes\r\nmottled; white throat, the white generally extending back on the neck,\r\nand sometimes, though rarely, still further along on the back. The color\r\nof the rest of the body is red, generally dark, but sometimes light.\r\nEighty years ago the best Hereford cattle were mottled or roan all over;\r\nand some of the best herds, down to a comparatively recent period, were\r\neither all mottled, or had the mottled or speckled face.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the face is mild and lively; the forehead open, broad,\r\nand large; the eyes bright and full of vivacity; the horns glossy,\r\nslender and spreading; the head small, though larger than, and not quite\r\nso clear as, that of the Devons; the lower jaw fine; neck long and\r\nslender; chest deep; breast-bone large, prominent, and very muscular;\r\nthe shoulder-blade light; shoulder full and soft; brisket and loins\r\nlarge; hips well developed, and on a level with the chine; hind quarters\r\nlong and well filled in; buttocks on a level with the back, neither\r\nfalling off nor raised above the hind quarters; tail slender, well set\r\non; hair fine and soft; body round and full; carcass deep and well\r\nformed, or cylindrical; bone small; thigh short and well made; legs\r\nshort and straight, and slender below the knee; as handlers very\r\nexcellent, especially mellow to the touch on the back, the shoulder, and\r\nalong the sides, the skin being soft, flexible, of medium thickness,\r\nrolling on the neck and the hips; hair bright; face almost bare, which\r\nis characteristic of pure Herefords.\r\n\r\nThey belong to the middle horned division of the cattle of Great\r\nBritain, to which they are indigenous, and have been improved within the\r\nlast century by careful selections.\r\n\r\nHereford oxen are excellent animals, less active but stronger than the\r\nDevons, and very free and docile. The demand for Herefords for beef\r\nprevents their being much used for work in their native county, and the\r\nfarmers there generally use horses instead of oxen.\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that the qualities in which Herefords stand\r\npre-eminent among the middle-sized breeds are in the production of oxen\r\nand their superiority of flesh. On these points there is little chance\r\nof their being excelled. It should, however, be borne in mind that the\r\nbest oxen are not produced from the largest cows; nor is a superior\r\nquality of flesh, such as is considered very soft to the touch, with\r\nthin skin. It is the union of these two qualities which often\r\ncharacterizes the short horns; but Hereford breeders--as a recent writer\r\nremarks--should endeavor to maintain a higher standard of\r\nexcellence--that for which the best of the breed have always been\r\nesteemed--a moderately thick, mellow hide, with a well apportioned\r\ncombination of softness with elasticity. A sufficiency of hair is also\r\ndesirable, and if accompanied with a disposition to curl moderately, it\r\nis more in esteem; but that which has a harsh and wiry feel is\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nIn point of symmetry and beauty of form, the well bred Herefords may be\r\nclassed with the improved short horns, though they arrive somewhat more\r\nslowly at maturity, and never attain such weight. Like the improved\r\nshort horns, they are chiefly bred for beef, and their beef is of the\r\nbest quality in the English markets, commanding the highest price of\r\nany, except perhaps, the West Highlanders. The short horn produces more\r\nbeef at the same age than the Hereford, but consumes more food in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nThe Herefords are far less generally spread over England than the\r\nimproved short horns. They have seldom been bred for milk, as some\r\nfamilies of the latter have; and it is not very unusual to find\r\npure-bred cows incapable of supplying milk sufficient to nourish their\r\ncalves. They have been imported to this country to some extent, and\r\nseveral fine herds exist in different sections; the earliest\r\nimportations being those of Henry Clay, of Kentucky, in 1817.\r\n\r\nThe want of care and attention to the udder, soon after calving,\r\nespecially if the cow be on luxuriant grass, often injures her milking\r\nproperties exceedingly. The practice in the county of Hereford has\r\ngenerally been to let the calves suckle from four to six months, and\r\nbull calves often run eight months with the cow. But their dairy\r\nqualities are perhaps as good as those of any cattle whose fattening\r\nproperties have been so carefully developed; and, though it is probable\r\nthat they could be bred for milk with proper care and attention, yet, as\r\nthis change would be at the expense of other qualities equally valuable,\r\nit would evidently be wiser to resort to other stock for the dairy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH DEVONS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NORTH DEVON STEER.]\r\n\r\nThis beautiful race of middle horned cattle dates further back than any\r\nwell established breed among us. It goes generally under the simple name\r\nof Devon; but the cattle of the southern part of the country, from which\r\nthe race derives its name, differ somewhat from those of the northern,\r\nhaving a larger and coarser frame, and far less tendency to fatten\r\nthough their dairy qualities are superior.\r\n\r\nThe North Devons are remarkable for hardihood, symmetry and beauty, and\r\nare generally bred for work and for beef, rather than for the dairy. The\r\nhead is fine and well set on; the horns of medium length, generally\r\ncurved; color usually bright blood-red, but sometimes inclining to\r\nyellow; skin thin and orange-yellow; hair of medium length, soft and\r\nsilky, making the animals remarkable as handlers; muzzle of the nose\r\nwhite; eyes full and mild; ears yellowish, or orange-color inside, of\r\nmoderate size; neck rather long, with little dewlap; shoulders oblique;\r\nlegs small and straight, with feet in proportion; chest of good width;\r\nribs round and expanded; loins of first-rate quality, long, wide, and\r\nfleshy; hips round, of medium width; rump level; tail full near the\r\nsetting on, tapering to the tip; thighs of the bull and ox muscular and\r\nfull, and high in the flank, though in the cow sometimes thought to be\r\nlight; the size medium, generally called small. The proportion of meat\r\non the valuable parts is greater, and the offal less, than on most other\r\nbreeds, while it is well settled that they consume less food in its\r\nproduction. The Devons are popular with the Smithfield butchers, and\r\ntheir beef is well marbled or grained.\r\n\r\nAs working oxen, the Devons perhaps excel all other races in quickness,\r\ndocility, beauty, and the ease with which they are matched. With a\r\nreasonable load, they are said to be equal to horses as walkers on the\r\nroad, and when they are no longer wanted for work they fatten easily and\r\nturn well.\r\n\r\nAs milkers, they do not excel--perhaps they may be said not to\r\nequal--the other breeds, and they have a reputation of being decidedly\r\nbelow the average. In their native country the general average of the\r\ndairy is one pound of butter a day during the summer. They are bred for\r\nbeef and for work, and not for the dairy; and their yield of milk is\r\nsmall, though of a rich quality. Several animals, however, of the\r\ncelebrated Patterson herd would have been remarkable as milkers even\r\namong good milking stock.\r\n\r\nStill, the faults of the North Devon cow, considered as a dairy animal,\r\nare too marked to be overlooked. The rotundity of form and compactness\r\nof frame, though they contribute to her remarkable beauty constitute an\r\nobjection to her for this purpose: since it is generally admitted that\r\nthe peculiarity of form which disposes an animal to take on fat is\r\nsomewhat incompatible with good milking qualities. On this account,\r\nYouatt--who is standard authority in such matters--says that for the\r\ndairy the North Devon must be acknowledged to be inferior to several\r\nother breeds. The milk is good, and yields more than the average\r\nproportion of cream and butter; but it is deficient in quantity. He also\r\nmaintains that its property as a milker could not be improved without\r\nproducing a certain detriment to its grazing qualities. Distinguished\r\nDevon breeders themselves have come to the same conclusion upon this\r\npoint. The improved North Devon cow may be classed, in this respect,\r\nwith the Hereford, neither of which has well developed milk-vessels--a\r\npoint of the utmost consequence to the practical dairyman.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIVE CATTLE.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing comprise the pure-bred races in America; for, though other\r\nand well-established breeds--like the Galloways, the long horns, the\r\nSpanish, and others--have, at times, been imported, and have had some\r\ninfluence on our American stock, yet they have not been kept distinct to\r\nsuch an extent as to become the prevailing stock of any particular\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nA large proportion, however--by far the largest proportion, indeed--of\r\nthe cattle known among us cannot be included under any of the races to\r\nwhich allusion has been made; and to the consideration of this class the\r\npresent article is devoted.\r\n\r\nThe term \"breed\"--as was set forth in the author's treatise, \"The Horse\r\nand his Diseases\"--when properly understood, applies only to animals of\r\nthe same species, possessing, besides the general characteristics of\r\nthat species, other characteristics peculiar to themselves, which they\r\nowe to the influence of soil, climate, nourishment, and the habits of\r\nlife to which they are subjected, and which they transmit with certainty\r\nto their progeny. The characteristics of certain breeds or families are\r\nso well marked, that, if an individual supposed to belong to any one of\r\nthem were to produce an offspring not possessing them, or possessing\r\nthem only in part, with others not belonging to the breed, it would be\r\njust ground for suspecting a want of purity of bloods.\r\n\r\nIn this view, no grade animals, and no animals destitute of fixed\r\npeculiarities or characteristics which they, share in common with all\r\nother animals of the class of which they are a type, and which they are\r\ncapable of transmitting with certainty to their descendants, can be\r\nrecognized by breeders as belonging to any one distinct race, breed, or\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe term \"native\" is applied to a vast majority of our American cattle,\r\nwhich, though born on the soil, and thus in one sense natives, do not\r\nconstitute a breed, race, or family, as correctly understood by\r\nbreeders. They do not possess characteristics peculiar to them all,\r\nwhich they transmit with any certainty to their offspring, either of\r\nform, size, color, milking or working properties.\r\n\r\nBut, though an animal may be made up of a mixture of blood almost to\r\nimpurity, it does not follow that, for specific purposes, it may not, as\r\nan individual animal, be one of the best of the species. Indeed, for\r\nparticular purposes, animals might be selected from among those commonly\r\ncalled \"natives\" in New England, and \"scrubs\" at the west and south,\r\nequal, and perhaps superior, to any among the races produced by the most\r\nskillful breeding.\r\n\r\nThere can be no objection, therefore, to the use of the term \"native,\"\r\nwhen it is understood as descriptive of no known breed, but only as\r\napplied to the common stock of a country, which does not constitute a\r\nbreed. But perhaps the entire class of animals commonly called \"natives\"\r\nwould be more accurately described as grades; since they are well known\r\nto have sprung from a great variety of cattle procured at different\r\ntimes and in different places on the continent of Europe, in England,\r\nand in the Spanish West Indies, brought together without any regard to\r\nfixed principles of breeding, but only from individual convenience, and\r\nby accident.\r\n\r\nThe first importations to this country were doubtless those taken to\r\nVirginia previous to 1609, though the exact date of their arrival is not\r\nknown. Several cows were carried there from the West Indies in 1610, and\r\nin the next year no less than one hundred arrived there from abroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAFT OXEN.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest cattle imported into New England arrived in 1624. At the\r\ndivision of cattle which took place three years after, one or two are\r\ndistinctly described as black, or black and white, others as brindle,\r\nshowing that there was no uniformity of color. Soon after this, a large\r\nnumber of cattle were brought over from England for the settlers at\r\nSalem. These importations formed the original stock of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn 1725, the first importation was made into New York from Holland by\r\nthe Dutch West India Company, and the foundation was then laid for an\r\nexceedingly valuable race of animals, which, subsequent importations\r\nfrom the same country, as well as from England, have greatly improved.\r\nThe points and value of this race in its purity have been already\r\nadverted to under the head of the Dutch cattle.\r\n\r\nIn 1627, cattle were brought from Sweden to the settlements on the\r\nDelaware, by the Swedish West India Company. In 1631, 1632, and 1633,\r\nseveral importations were made into New Hampshire by Captain John Mason\r\nwho, with Gorges, had procured the patent of large tracts of land in the\r\nvicinity of the Piscataqua river, and who immediately formed settlements\r\nthere. The object of Mason was to carry on the manufacture of potash.\r\nFor this purpose he employed the Danes; and it was in his voyage to and\r\nfrom Denmark that he procured many Danish cattle and horses, which were\r\nsubsequently scattered over that entire region, large numbers being\r\ndriven to the vicinity of Boston and sold. These Danish cattle are\r\ndescribed as large and coarse, of a yellow color; and it is supposed\r\nthat they were procured by Mason as being best capable of enduring the\r\nseverity of the climate and the hardships to which they would be\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, they very soon spread among the colonists of\r\nthe Massachusetts Bay, and have undoubtedly left their marks on the\r\nstock of the New England and the Middle States, which exist to some\r\nextent even to the present day, mixed in with an infinite multitude of\r\ncrosses with the Devons, the Dutch cattle already alluded to, the black\r\ncattle of Spain and Wales, and the long horn and the short horn--most of\r\nwhich crosses were accidental, or due to local circumstances or\r\nindividual convenience. Many of these cattle, the descendants of such\r\ncrosses, are of a very high order of merit; but to which particular\r\ncross this is due, it is impossible to say. They generally make hardy,\r\nstrong, and docile oxen, easily broken to the yoke and quick to work,\r\nwith a fair tendency to fatten when well fed; while the cows, though\r\noften ill-shaped, are sometimes remarkably good milkers, especially as\r\nregards the quantity which they give.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it has been remarked by excellent judges of stock, that if they\r\ndesired to select a dairy of cows for milk for sale, they would make\r\ntheir selection from cows commonly called native, in preference to\r\npure-bred animals of any of the established breeds, and that they\r\nbelieved they should find such a dairy the most profitable.\r\n\r\nIn color, the natives, made up as already indicated, are exceedingly\r\nvarious. The old Denmarks, which to a considerable extent laid the\r\nfoundation of the stock of Maine and New Hampshire, were light yellow.\r\nThe Dutch of New York and the Middle States, were black and white; the\r\nSpanish and Welsh were generally black; the Devons, which are supposed\r\nto have laid the foundation of the stock of some of the States, were\r\nred. Crosses of the Denmark with the Spanish and Welsh naturally made a\r\ndark brindle; crosses of the Devon often made a lighter or yellowish\r\nbrindle while the more recent importations of Jerseys and short horns\r\nhave generally produced a beautiful spotted progeny. The deep red has\r\nlong been a favorite color in New England; but the prejudice in its\r\nfavor is fast giving way to more variegated colors.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier importations into this country were also several\r\nvarieties of hornless cattle, which have been kept measurably distinct\r\nin some sections; or where they have been crossed with the common stock\r\nthere has been a tendency to produce hornless grades. These are not\r\nunfrequently known as \"buffalo cattle.\" They were, in many cases,\r\nsupposed to belong to the Galloway breed; or, which is more likely, to\r\nthe Suffolk dun, a variety of the Galloway, and a far better milking\r\nstock than the Galloways, from which, it sprung. These polled, or\r\nhornless cattle vary in color and qualities, but they are usually very\r\ngood milkers when well kept, and many of them fatten well, and attain\r\ngood weight.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian cattle have also been imported, to some extent, into\r\ndifferent parts of the country, and have been crossed upon the natives\r\nwith some success. Many other strains of blood from different breeds\r\nhave also contributed to build up the common stock of the country of the\r\npresent day; and there can be no question that its appearance and value\r\nhave been largely improved during the last quarter of a century, nor\r\nthat improvements are still in progress which will lead to satisfactory\r\nresults in the future.\r\n\r\nBut, though we already have an exceedingly valuable foundation for\r\nimprovement, no one will pretend to deny that our cattle, as a whole,\r\nare susceptible of it in many respects. They possess neither the size,\r\nthe symmetry, nor the early maturity of the short horns; they do not, as\r\na general thing, possess the fineness of bone, the beauty of form and\r\ncolor, nor the activity of the Devons or the Herefords; they do not\r\npossess that uniform richness of milk, united with generous quality, of\r\nthe Ayrshires, nor the surpassing richness of milk of the Jerseys: but,\r\nabove all, they do not possess the power of transmitting the many good\r\nqualities which they often have to their offspring--which is the\r\ncharacteristic of all well established breeds.\r\n\r\nIt is equally certain, in the opinion of many good judges, that the\r\ndairy stock of the country has not been materially improved in its\r\nintrinsic good qualities during the last thirty or forty years. This may\r\nnot be true of certain sections, where the dairy has been made a special\r\nobject of pursuit, and where the custom of raising the best male calves\r\nof the neighborhood, or those that came from the best dairy cows, and\r\nthen of using only the best formed bulls, has long prevailed. Although\r\nin this way some progress has, doubtless, been made, there are still\r\nroom and need for more. More attention must be paid to correct\r\nprinciples of breeding before the satisfactory results which every\r\nfarmer should strive to reach can be attained.\r\n\r\nHaving glanced generally at the leading breeds of cattle in Great\r\nBritain, and examined, more in detail, the various breeds in the United\r\nStates, the next subject demanding attention is,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF CATTLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF THE OX AS COVERED BY THE MUSCLES.\r\n\r\n1.

With one thousand and\r\nthirty one cows, whose gestations were carefully observed in France, the\r\naverage period was about two hundred and eighty-five days.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF TEETH.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance to be able to judge of the age of a cow.\r\nFew farmers wish to purchase a cow for the dairy after she has passed\r\nher prime, which will ordinarily be at the age of nine or ten years,\r\nvarying, of course, according to care, feeding, &c., in the earlier part\r\nof her life.\r\n\r\nThe common method of forming an estimate of the age of cattle is by an\r\nexamination of the horn. At three years old, as a general rule, the\r\nhorns are perfectly smooth; after this, a ring appears near the nob, and\r\nannually afterward a new one is formed, so that, by adding two years to\r\nthe first ring, the age is calculated. This is a very uncertain mode of\r\njudging. The rings are distinct only in the cow; and it is well known\r\nthat if a heifer goes to bull when she is two years old, or a little\r\nbefore or after that time, a change takes place in the horn and the\r\nfirst ring appears; so that a real three-year-old would carry the mark\r\nof a four-year-old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEETH AT BIRTH.]\r\n\r\nThe rings on the horns of a bull are either not seen until five, or they\r\ncannot be traced at all; while in the ox they do not appear till he is\r\nfive years old, and then are often very indistinct. In addition to this,\r\nit is by no means an uncommon practice to file the horns, so as to make\r\nthem smooth, and to give the animal the appearance of being much younger\r\nthan it really is. This is, therefore, an exceedingly fallacious guide,\r\nand cannot be relied upon by any one with the degree of confidence\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND WEEK.]\r\n\r\nThe surest indication of the age in cattle, as in the horse, is given by\r\nthe teeth.\r\n\r\nThe calf, at birth, will usually have two incisor or front teeth--in\r\nsome cases just appearing through the gums; in others, fully set,\r\nvarying as the cow falls short of, or exceeds, her regular time of\r\ncalving. If she overruns several days, the teeth will have set and\r\nattained considerable size, as appears in the cut representing teeth at\r\nbirth. During the second week, a tooth will usually be added on each\r\nside, and the mouth will generally appear as in the next cut; and before\r\nthe end of the third week, the animal will generally have six incisor\r\nteeth, as denoted in the cut representing teeth at the third week; and\r\nin a week from that time the full number of incisors will have appeared,\r\nas seen in the next cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE WEEKS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIVE TO EIGHT MONTHS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEN MONTHS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWELVE MONTHS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIFTEEN MONTHS.]\r\n\r\nThese teeth are temporary, and are often called milk-teeth. Their edge\r\nis very sharp; and as the animal begins to live upon more solid food,\r\nthis edge becomes worn, showing the bony part of the tooth beneath, and\r\nindicates with considerable precision the length of time they have been\r\nused. The centre, or oldest teeth show the marks of age first, and often\r\nbecome somewhat worn before the corner teeth appear. At eight weeks, the\r\nfour inner teeth are nearly as sharp as before. They appear worn not so\r\nmuch on the outer edge or line of the tooth, as inside this line; but,\r\nafter this, the edge begins gradually to lose its sharpness, and to\r\npresent a more flattened surface; while the next outer teeth wear down\r\nlike the four central ones; and at three months this wearing off is very\r\napparent, till at four months all the incisor teeth appear worn, but the\r\ninner ones the most. Now the teeth begin slowly to diminish in size by\r\na kind of contraction, as well as wearing down, and the distance apart\r\nbecomes more and more apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EIGHTEEN MONTHS.]\r\n\r\nFrom the fifth to the eighth month, the inner teeth will usually appear\r\nas in the cut of the teeth at that time; and at ten months, this change\r\nshows more clearly, as represented in the next cut; and the spaces\r\nbetween them begin to show very plainly, till at a year old they\r\nordinarily present the appearance of the following cut; and at the age\r\nof fifteen months, that shown in the next, where the corner teeth are\r\nnot more than half the original size, and the centre ones still smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO YEARS PAST.]\r\n\r\nThe permanent teeth are now rapidly growing, and preparing to take the\r\nplace of the milk-teeth, which are gradually absorbed till they\r\ndisappear, or are pushed out to give place to the two permanent central\r\nincisors, which at a year and a half will generally present the\r\nappearance indicated in the cut, which shows the internal structure of\r\nthe lower jaw at this time, with the cells of the teeth, the two central\r\nones protruding into the mouth, the next two pushing up, but not quite\r\ngrown to the surface, with the third pair just perceptible. These\r\nchanges require time; and at two years past the jaw will usually appear\r\nas in the cut, where four of the permanent central incisors are seen.\r\nAfter this, the other milk-teeth decrease rapidly, but are slow to\r\ndisappear; and at three years old, the third pair of permanent teeth are\r\nbut formed, as represented in the cut; and at four years the last pair\r\nof incisors will be up, as in the cut of that age; but the outside ones\r\nare not yet fully grown, and the beast can hardly be said to be\r\nfull-mouthed till the age of five years. But before this age, or at the\r\nage of four years, the two inner pairs of permanent teeth are beginning\r\nto wear at the edges, as shown in the cut; while at five years old the\r\nwhole set becomes somewhat worn down at the top, and on the two centre\r\nones a darker line appears in the middle, along a line of harder bone,\r\nas appears in the appropriate cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE YEARS PAST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUR YEARS PAST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIVE YEARS PAST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEN YEARS PAST.]\r\n\r\nNow will come a year or two, and sometimes three, when the teeth do not\r\nso clearly indicate the exact age, and the judgment must be guided by\r\nthe extent to which the dark middle lines are worn. This will depend\r\nsomewhat upon the exposure and feeding of the animal; but at seven years\r\nthese lines extend over all the teeth. At eight years, another change\r\nbegins, which cannot be mistaken. A kind of absorption begins with the\r\ntwo central incisors--slow at first, but perceptible--and these two\r\nteeth become smaller than the rest, while the dark lines are worn into\r\none in all but the corner teeth, till, at ten years, four of the central\r\nincisors have become smaller in size, with a smaller and fainter mark,\r\nas indicated in the proper cut. At eleven, the six inner teeth are\r\nsmaller than the corner ones; and at twelve, all become smaller than\r\nthey were, while the dark lines are nearly gone, except in the corner\r\nteeth, and the inner edge is worn to the gum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF A GOOD COW.\r\n\r\nAfter satisfaction is afforded touching the age of a cow, she should be\r\nexamined with reference to her soundness of constitution. A good\r\nconstitution is indicated by large lungs, which are found in a deep,\r\nbroad, and prominent chest, broad and well-spread ribs, a respiration\r\nsomewhat slow and regular, a good appetite, and if in milk a strong\r\ninclination to drink, which a large secretion of milk almost invariably\r\nstimulates. In such a cow the digestive organs are active and energetic,\r\nand they make an abundance of good blood, which in turn stimulates the\r\nactivity of the nervous system, and furnishes the milky glands with the\r\nmeans of abundant secretion. Such a cow, when dry, readily takes on fat.\r\nWhen activity of the milk-glands is found united with close ribs, small\r\nand feeble lungs, and a slow appetite, often attended by great thirst,\r\nthe cow will generally possess only a weak and feeble constitution; and\r\nif the milk is plentiful, it will generally be of bad quality, while the\r\nanimal, if she does not die of diseased lungs, will not readily take on\r\nfat, when dry and fed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GOOD MILCH COW.]\r\n\r\nIn order to have no superfluous flesh, the cow should have a small,\r\nclean, and rather long head, tapering toward the muzzle. A cow with a\r\nlarge, coarse head will seldom fatten readily, or give a large quantity\r\nof milk. A coarse head increases the proportion of weight of the least\r\nvaluable parts, while it is a sure indication that the whole bony\r\nstructure is too heavy. The mouth should be large and broad; the eye\r\nbright and sparkling, but of a peculiar placidness of expression, with\r\nno indication of wildness, but rather a mild and feminine look. These\r\npoints will indicate gentleness of disposition. Such cows seem to like\r\nto be milked, are fond of being caressed, and often return caresses. The\r\nhorns should be small, short, tapering, yellowish, and glistening. The\r\nneck should be small, thin, and tapering toward the head, but thickening\r\nwhen it approaches the shoulder; the dewlaps small. The fore quarters\r\nshould be rather small when compared with the hind quarters. The form of\r\nthe barrel will be large, and each rib should project further than the\r\npreceding one, up to the loins. She should be well formed across the\r\nhips and in the rump.\r\n\r\nThe spine or back-bone should be straight and long, rather loosely hung,\r\nor open along the middle part, the result of the distance between the\r\ndorsal vertebræ, which sometimes causes a slight depression, or sway\r\nback. By some good judges, this mark is regarded as of great importance,\r\nespecially when the bones of the hind quarters are also rather loosely\r\nput together, leaving the rump of great width and the pelvis large, and\r\nthe organs and milk-vessels lodged in the cavities largely developed.\r\nThe skin over the rump should be loose and flexible. This point is of\r\ngreat importance; and as, when the cow is in low condition or very poor,\r\nit will appear somewhat harder and closer than it otherwise would, some\r\npractice and close observation are required to judge well of this mark.\r\nThe skin, indeed, all over the body, should be soft and mellow to the\r\ntouch, with soft and glossy hair. The tail, if thick at the setting on,\r\nshould taper and be fine below.\r\n\r\nBut the udder is of special importance. It should be large in\r\nproportion to the size of the animal, and the skin thin, with soft,\r\nloose folds extending well back, capable of great distension when\r\nfilled, but shrinking to a small compass when entirely empty. It must be\r\nfree from lumps in every part, and provided with four teats set well\r\napart, and of medium size. Nor is it less important to observe the\r\nmilk-veins carefully. The principal ones under the belly should be large\r\nand prominent, and extend forward to the navel, losing themselves,\r\napparently, in the very best milkers, in a large cavity in the flesh,\r\ninto which the end of the finger can be inserted; but when the cow is\r\nnot in full milk, the milk-vein, at other times very prominent, is not\r\nso distinctly traced; and hence, to judge of its size when the cow is\r\ndry, or nearly so, this vein may be pressed near its end, or at its\r\nentrance into the body, when it will immediately fill up to its full\r\nsize. This vein does not convey the milk to the udder, as some suppose,\r\nbut is the channel by which the blood returns; and its contents consist\r\nof the refuse of the secretion, or of what has not been taken up in\r\nforming milk. There are also veins in the udder, and the perineum, or\r\nthe space above the udder, and between that and the buttocks, which it\r\nis of special importance to observe. These veins should be largely\r\ndeveloped, and irregular or knotted, especially those of the udder. They\r\nare largest in great milkers.\r\n\r\nThe knotted veins of the perineum, extending from above downwards in a\r\nwinding line, are not readily seen in young heifers, and are very\r\ndifficult to find in poor cows, or those of only a medium quality. They\r\nare easily found in very good milkers, and if not at first apparent,\r\nthey are made so by pressing upon them at the base of the perineum,\r\nwhen they swell up and send the blood back toward the vulva. They form\r\na kind of thick network under the skin of the perineum, raising it up\r\nsomewhat, in some cases near the vulva, in others nearer down and closer\r\nto the udder. It is important to look for these veins, as they often\r\nform a very important guide, and by some they would be considered as\r\nfurnishing the surest indications of the milking qualities of the cow.\r\nFull development almost always shows an abundant secretion of milk; but\r\nthey are far better developed after the cow has had two or three calves,\r\nwhen two or three years' milking has given full activity to the milky\r\nglands, and attracted a large flow of blood. The larger and more\r\nprominent these veins the better. It is needless to say that in\r\nobserving them some regard should be had to the condition of the cow,\r\nthe thickness of skin and fat by which they may be surrounded, and the\r\ngeneral activity and food of the animal. Food calculated to stimulate\r\nthe greatest flow of milk will naturally increase these veins, and give\r\nthem more than usual prominence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILK-MIRROR.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of M. Guénon, of Bordeaux, in France--a man of remarkable\r\npractical sagacity, and a close observer of stock--consisted in the\r\nconnection between the milking qualities of the cow and certain external\r\nmarks on the udder, and on the space above it, called the perineum,\r\nextending to the buttocks. To these marks he gave the name of\r\nmilk-mirror, or escutcheon, which consists in certain perceptible spots\r\nrising up from the udder in different directions, forms and sizes, on\r\nwhich the hair grows upward, whilst the hair on other parts of the body\r\ngrows downward. The reduction of these marks into a system, explaining\r\nthe value of particular forms and sizes of the milk-mirror, belongs\r\nexclusively to Guénon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [A.]]\r\n\r\nHe divided the milk-mirror into eight classes, and each class into eight\r\norders, making in all no less than sixty-four divisions, which he\r\nafterward increased by subdivisions, thus rendering the whole system\r\ncomplicated in the extreme, especially as he professed to be able to\r\njudge with accuracy, by means of the milk-mirror, not only of the exact\r\nquantity a cow would give, but also of the quality of the milk, and of\r\nthe length of time it would continue. He endeavored to prove too much,\r\nand was, as a matter of consequence, frequently at fault himself.\r\n\r\nDespite the strictures which have been passed upon Guénon's method of\r\njudging of cows, the best breeders and judges of stock concur in the\r\nopinion, as the result of their observations, that cows with the most\r\nperfectly developed milk-mirrors are, with rare exception, the best\r\nmilkers of their breed; and that cows with small and slightly developed\r\nmilk-mirrors are, in the majority of cases, bad milkers. There are,\r\nundoubtedly, cows with very small mirrors, which are, nevertheless,\r\nvery fair in the yield of milk; and among those with middling quality of\r\nmirrors, instances of rather more than ordinary milkers often occur,\r\nwhile at the same time it is true that cases now and then are found\r\nwhere the very best marked and developed mirrors are found on very poor\r\nmilkers. These apparent exceptions, however, are to be explained, in the\r\nlarge majority of cases, by causes outside of those which affect the\r\nappearance of the milk-mirror. It is, of course, impossible to estimate\r\nwith mathematical accuracy either the quantity, quality, or duration of\r\nthe milk, since it is affected by so many chance circumstances, which\r\ncannot always be known or estimated by even the most skillful judges;\r\nsuch, for example, as the food, the treatment, the temperament,\r\naccidental diseases, inflammation of the udder, premature calving, the\r\nclimate and season, the manner in which she has been milked, and a\r\nthousand other things which interrupt or influence the flow of milk,\r\nwithout materially changing the size or shape of the milk-mirror. It\r\nhas, indeed, been very justly observed that we often see cows equally\r\nwell formed, with precisely the same milk-mirror, and kept in the same\r\ncircumstances, yet giving neither equal quantities nor similar qualities\r\nof milk. Nor could it be otherwise; since the action of the organs\r\ndepends, not merely on their size and form, but, to a great extent, on\r\nthe general condition of each individual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [B.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [C.]]\r\n\r\nThe different forms of milk-mirrors are represented by the shaded parts\r\nof cuts, lettered A, B, C, D; but it is necessary to premise that upon\r\nthe cows themselves they are always partly concealed by the thighs, the\r\nudder, and the folds of the skin, which are not shown, and therefore\r\nthey are not always so uniform in nature as they appear in the cuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [D.]]\r\n\r\nTheir size varies as the skin is more or less folded or stretched; while\r\nthe cuts represent the skin as uniform or free from folds, but not\r\nstretched out. It is usually very easy to distinguish the milk-mirrors\r\nby the upward direction of the hair which forms them. They are sometimes\r\nmarked by a line of bristly hair growing in the opposite direction,\r\nwhich surrounds them, forming a sort of outline by the upward and\r\ndownward growing hair. Yet, when the hair is very fine and short, mixed\r\nwith longer hairs, and the skin much folded, and the udder voluminous\r\nand pressed by the thighs, it is necessary, in order to distinguish the\r\npart enclosed between the udder and the legs, and examine the full size\r\nof the mirrors, to observe them attentively, and to place the legs wide\r\napart, and to smooth out the skin, in order to avoid the folds.\r\n\r\nThe mirrors may also be observed by holding the back of the hand against\r\nthe perineum, and drawing it from above downward, when the nails rubbing\r\nagainst the up-growing hair, make the parts covered by it very\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nAs the hair of the milk-mirror has not the same direction as the hair\r\nwhich surrounds it, it may often be distinguished by a difference in the\r\nshade reflected by it. It is then sufficient to place it properly to the\r\nlight in order to see the difference in shade, and to make out the part\r\ncovered by the upward-growing hair. Most frequently, however, the hair\r\nof the milk-mirror is thin and fine, and the color of the skin can\r\neasily be seen. If the eye alone is trusted, we shall often be deceived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [E.]]\r\n\r\nIn some countries cattle-dealers shave the back part of the cow. Just\r\nafter this operation the mirrors can neither be seen nor felt; but this\r\ninconvenience ceases in a few days. It may be added that the\r\nshaving--designed, as the dealers say, to beautify the cow--is generally\r\nintended simply to destroy the milk-mirror, and to deprive buyers of one\r\nmeans of judging of the milking qualities of the cows. It is unnecessary\r\nto add that the cows most carefully shaven are those which are badly\r\nmarked, and that it is prudent to take it for granted that cows so shorn\r\nare bad milkers.\r\n\r\nMilk-mirrors vary in position, extent, and the figure which they\r\nrepresent. They may be divided according to their position, into mirrors\r\nor escutcheons, properly so called, or into lower and upper tufts, or\r\nescutcheons. The latter are very small in comparison with the former,\r\nand are situated in close proximity to the vulva, as seen at 1, in cut\r\nE. They are very common on cows of bad milking races, but are very\r\nrarely seen on the best milch cows. They consist of one or two ovals, or\r\nsmall bands of up-growing hair, and serve to indicate the continuance of\r\nthe flow of milk. The period is short, in proportion as the tufts are\r\nlarge. They must not be confounded with the escutcheon proper, which is\r\noften extended up to the vulva. They are separated from it by bands of\r\nhair, more or less large, as in cut marked F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [F.]]\r\n\r\nMilk-mirrors are sometimes symmetrical, and sometimes without symmetry.\r\nWhen there is a great difference in the extent of the two halves, it\r\nalmost always happens that the teats on the side where the mirror is\r\nbest developed give more milk than those of the opposite side. The left\r\nhalf of the mirror, it may be remarked, is almost always the largest;\r\nand so, when the perinean part is folded into a square, it is on this\r\nside of the body that it unfolds. Of three thousand cows in Denmark,\r\nbut a single one was found, whose escutcheon varied even a little from\r\nthis rule.\r\n\r\nThe mirrors having a value in proportion to the space which they occupy,\r\nit is of great importance to attend to all the rows of down-growing\r\nhairs, which diminish the extent of surface, whether these tufts are in\r\nthe midst of the mirror, or form indentations on its edges.\r\n\r\nThese indentations, concealed in part by the folds of the skin, are\r\nsometimes seen with difficulty; but it is important to take them into\r\naccount, since in a great many cows they materially lessen the size of\r\nthe mirror. Cows are often found, whose milk-mirrors at first sight\r\nappear very large, but which are only medium milkers; and it will\r\nusually be found that lateral indentations greatly diminish the surface\r\nof up-growing hair. Many errors are committed in estimating the value of\r\nsuch cows, from a want of attention to the real extent of the mirror.\r\n\r\nAll the interruptions in the surface of the mirror indicate a diminution\r\nin the quantity of the milk, with the exception, however, of small oval\r\nor elliptical plates which are found in the mirror, on the back part of\r\nthe udders of the best cows, as represented in the cut already given,\r\nmarked A. These ovals have a peculiar tint, which is occasioned by the\r\ndownward direction of the hair which forms them. In the best cows these\r\novals exist with the lower mirrors very well developed, as represented\r\nin the cut just named.\r\n\r\nIn short, it should be stated that, in order to determine the extent and\r\nsignificance of a mirror, it is necessary to consider the state of the\r\nperineum as to fat, and that of the fullness of the udder. In a fat cow,\r\nwith an inflated udder, the mirror would appear larger than it really\r\nis; whilst in a lean cow, with a loose and wrinkled udder, it appears\r\nsmaller. Fat will cover faults--a fact to be borne in mind when\r\nselecting a cow.\r\n\r\nIn bulls, the mirrors present the same peculiarities as in cows; but\r\nthey are less varied in their form, and especially much less in size.\r\n\r\nIn calves, the mirrors show the shapes which they are afterwards to\r\nhave, only they are more contracted, because the parts which they cover\r\nare but slightly developed. They are easily seen after birth; but the\r\nhair which then covers them is long, coarse, and stiff; and when this\r\nhair falls off, the calf's mirror will resemble that of the cow, but\r\nwill be of less size.\r\n\r\nWith calves, however, it should be stated, in addition, that the\r\nmilk-mirrors are more distinctly recognized on those from cows that are\r\nwell kept, and that they will generally be fully developed at two years\r\nold. Some changes take place in the course of years, but the outlines of\r\nthe mirror appear prominent at the time of advanced pregnancy, or, in\r\nthe case of cows giving milk, at the times when the udder is more\r\ndistended with milk than at others.\r\n\r\nM. Mayne, who has explained and simplified the method of M. Guénon,\r\ndivides cows, according to the quantity which they give, into four\r\nclasses: first, the very good; second, the good; third, the medium; and\r\nfourth, the bad.\r\n\r\nIn the FIRST class he places cows, both parts of whose milk mirror, the\r\nmammary--the tuft situated on the udder, the legs and the thighs--and\r\nthe perinean--that on the perineum, extending sometimes more or less out\r\nupon the thighs--are large, continuous, and uniform, covering at least\r\na great part of the perineum, the udder, the inner surface of the\r\nthighs, and extending more or less out upon the legs, as in cut A, with\r\nno interruptions, or, if any, small ones, oval in form, and situated on\r\nthe posterior face of the udder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [G.]]\r\n\r\nSuch mirrors are found on most very good cows, but may also be found on\r\ncows which can scarcely be called good, and which should be ranked in\r\nthe next class. But cows, whether having very well developed mirrors or\r\nnot, may be reckoned as very good, and as giving as much milk as is to\r\nbe expected from their size, food, and the hygienic circumstances in\r\nwhich they are kept, if they present the following characteristics:\r\nveins of the perineum large, as if swollen, and visible on the\r\nexterior--as in cut A--or which can easily be made to appear by pressing\r\nupon the base of the perineum; veins of the udder large and knotted;\r\nmilk-veins large, often double, equal on both sides, and forming\r\nzig-zags, under the belly.\r\n\r\nTo the signs furnished by the veins and by the mirror, may be added also\r\nthe following marks: a uniform, very large, and yielding udder,\r\nshrinking much in milking, and covered with soft skin and fine hair;\r\ngood constitution, full chest, regular appetite, and great propensity to\r\ndrink. Such cows rather incline to be poor than to be fat. The skin is\r\nsoft and yielding; short, fine hair; small head; fine horns; bright,\r\nsparkling eye; mild expression; feminine look; with a fine neck.\r\n\r\nCows of this first class are very rare. They give, even when small in\r\nsize, from ten to fourteen quarts of milk a day; and the largest sized\r\nfrom eighteen to twenty-six quarts a day, and even more. Just after\r\ncalving, if arrived at maturity and fed with good, wholesome, moist food\r\nin sufficient quantity and quality, adapted to promote the secretion of\r\nmilk, they can give about a pint of milk for every ten ounces of hay, or\r\nits equivalent, which they eat.\r\n\r\nThey continue in milk for a long period. The best never go dry, and may\r\nbe milked even up to the time of calving, giving from eight to ten\r\nquarts of milk a day. But even the best cows often fall short of the\r\nquantity of milk which they are able to give, from being fed on food\r\nwhich is too dry, or not sufficiently varied, or not rich enough in\r\nnutritive qualities, or deficient in quantity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [H.]]\r\n\r\nThe SECOND class is that of _good cows_; and to this belong the best\r\ncommonly found in the market and among the cow-feeders of cities.\r\n\r\nThey have the mammary part of the milk-mirror well developed, but the\r\nperinean part contracted, or wholly wanting, as in cut G; or both parts\r\nof the mirror are moderately developed, or slightly indented, as in cut\r\nH. Cut E belongs also to this class, in the lower part; but it indicates\r\na cow, which--as the upper mirror, 1, indicates--dries up sooner when\r\nagain in calf.\r\n\r\nThese marks, though often seen in many good cows, should be considered\r\nas certain only when the veins of the perineum form, under the skin, a\r\nkind of network, which, without being very apparent, may be felt by a\r\npressure on them; when the milk-veins on the belly are well-developed,\r\nthough less knotty and less prominent than in cows of the first class;\r\nin short, when the udder is well developed, and presents veins which are\r\nsufficiently numerous, though not very large.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here, as in the preceding class, to distrust cows in\r\nwhich the mirror is not accompanied by large veins. This remark applies\r\nespecially to cows which have had several calves, and are in full milk.\r\nThey are medium or bad, let the milk-mirror be what it may, if the veins\r\nof the belly are not large, and those of the udder apparent.\r\n\r\nThe general characteristics which depend on form and constitution\r\ncombine, less than in cows of the preceding class, the marks of good\r\nhealth and excellent constitution with those of a gentle and feminine\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nSmall cows of this class give from seven to ten or eleven quarts of milk\r\na day, and the largest from thirteen to seventeen quarts. They can be\r\nmade to give three-fourths of a pint of milk, just after calving, for\r\nevery ten ounces of hay consumed, if well cared for, and fed in a manner\r\nfavorable to the secretion of milk.\r\n\r\nThey hold out long in milk, when they have no upper mirrors or tufts. At\r\nseven or eight months in calf, they may give from five to eight quarts\r\nof milk a day.\r\n\r\nThe THIRD class consists of _middling cows_. When the milk-mirror\r\nreally presents only the mammary or lower part slightly indicated or\r\ndeveloped, and the perinean part contracted, narrow, and irregular--as\r\nin cut K--the cows are middling. The udder is slightly developed or\r\nhard, and shrinks very little after milking. The veins of the perineum\r\nare not apparent, and those which run along the lower side of the\r\nabdomen are small, straight, and sometimes unequal. In this case the\r\nmirror is not symmetrical, and the cow gives more milk on the side where\r\nthe vein is the largest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [K.]]\r\n\r\nThese cows have large heads, and a thick, hard skin. Being ordinarily in\r\ngood condition, they are beautiful to look at, and seem to be well\r\nformed. Many of them are nervous and restive, and not easily approached.\r\n\r\nCows of this class give, according to size, from three or four to ten\r\nquarts of milk. They very rarely give, even in the most favorable\r\ncircumstances, half a pint of milk for every ten ounces of hay which\r\nthey consume. The milk diminishes rapidly, and dries up wholly the\r\nfourth or fifth month in calf.\r\n\r\nThe FOURTH class is composed of _bad cows_. As they are commonly in\r\ngood condition, these cows are often the most beautiful of the herd and\r\nin the markets. They have fleshy thighs, thick and hard skin, a large\r\nand coarse neck and head, and horns large at the base.\r\n\r\nThe udder is hard, small and fleshy, with a skin covered with long,\r\nrough hair. No veins are to be seen either on the perineum or the udder,\r\nwhile those of the belly are slightly developed, and the mirrors are\r\nordinarily small, as in cut L.\r\n\r\nWith these characteristics, cows give only a few quarts of milk a day,\r\nand dry up in a short time after calving. Some of them can scarcely\r\nnourish their calves, even when they are properly cared for and well\r\nfed.\r\n\r\nSickly habits, chronic affections of the digestive organs, the chest,\r\nthe womb, and the lacteal system, sometimes greatly affect the milk\r\nsecretion, and cause cows troubled with them to fall from the first or\r\nsecond to the third, and sometimes to the fourth class.\r\n\r\nWithout pushing this method of judging of the good milking qualities of\r\ncows into the objectionable extreme to which it was carried by its\r\noriginator, it may be safely asserted that the milk-mirror forms an\r\nimportant additional mark or point for distinguishing good milkers; and\r\nit may be laid down as a rule that, in the selection of milch cows, as\r\nwell as in the choice of young animals for breeders, the milk-mirror\r\nshould, by all means, be examined and considered; but that we should not\r\nlimit or confine ourselves exclusively to it, and that other and\r\nlong-known marks should be equally regarded.\r\n\r\nThere are cases, however, where a knowledge and careful examination of\r\nthe form and size of the mirror become of the highest importance. It is\r\nwell known that certain signs or marks of great milkers are developed,\r\nonly as the capacities of the animal herself are fully and completely\r\ndeveloped by age. The milk-veins, for instance, are never so large and\r\nprominent in heifers and young cows as in old ones, and the same may be\r\nsaid of the udder, and of the veins of the udder and perineum; all of\r\nwhich it is of great importance to observe in the selection of milch\r\ncows. Those signs, then, which in cows arrived at maturity are almost\r\nsufficient in themselves to warrant a conclusion as to their merits as\r\nmilkers, are, to a great extent, wanting in younger animals, and\r\naltogether in calves, as to which there is often doubt whether they\r\nshall be raised; and here a knowledge of the form of the mirror is of\r\nimmense advantage, since it gives, at the outset and before any expense\r\nis incurred, a somewhat reliable means of judging of the future milking\r\ncapacities of the animal; or, if a male, of the probability of his\r\ntransmitting milking qualities to his offspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK-MIRROR [L.]]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, from an examination of the points of a good milch cow\r\nthat, though the same marks which indicate the greatest milking\r\nqualities may not always indicate the greatest aptitude to fatten, yet\r\nthat the signs which denote good fattening qualities are included among\r\nthe signs favorable to the production of milk; such as soundness of\r\nconstitution, marked by good organs of digestion and respiration\r\nfineness and mellowness of the skin and hair, quietness of\r\ndisposition--which inclines the animal to rest and lie down while\r\nchewing the cud--and other marks which are relied on by graziers in\r\nselecting animals to fatten.\r\n\r\nIn buying dairy stock the farmer generally finds it for his interest to\r\nselect young heifers, as they give the promise of longer usefulness. But\r\nit is often the case that older cows are selected with the design of\r\nusing them for the dairy for a limited period, and then feeding them for\r\nthe butcher. In either case, it is advisable, as a rule, to choose\r\nanimals in low or medium condition. The farmer cannot commonly afford to\r\nbuy fat; it is more properly his business to make it, and to have it to\r\nsell. Good and well-marked cows in poor condition will rapidly gain in\r\nflesh and products when removed to better pastures and higher keeping,\r\nand they cost less in the original purchase.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, superfluous to add that regard should be had to the\r\nquality of the pasturage and keeping which a cow has previously had, as\r\ncompared with that to which she is to be subjected. The size of the\r\nanimal should also be considered with reference to the fertility of the\r\npastures into which she is to be put. Small or medium-sized animals\r\naccommodate themselves to ordinary pastures far better than large ones.\r\nWhere a very large cow will do well, two small ones will usually do\r\nbetter; while the large animal might fail entirely where two small ones\r\nwould do well. It is better to have the whole herd, so far as may be,\r\nuniform in size; for, if they vary greatly, some may get more than they\r\nneed, and others will not have enough. This, however, cannot always be\r\nbrought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCrossing and Breeding\r\n\r\n\r\nThe raising of cattle has now become a source of profit in many\r\nsections,--to a greater extent, at least, than formerly--and it becomes\r\na matter of great practical importance to our farmers to take the proper\r\nsteps to improve them. Indeed, the questions--what are the best breeds,\r\nand what are the best crosses, and how shall I improve my stock--are now\r\nasked almost daily; and their practical solution would add many thousand\r\ndollars to the aggregate wealth of the farmers of the country, if they\r\nwould all study their own interests.\r\n\r\nThe time is gradually passing away when the intelligent practical farmer\r\nwill be willing to put his cows to any bull, simply because his services\r\nmay be had for twenty-five cents; for, even if the progeny is to go to\r\nthe butcher, the calf sired by a pure-bred bull--particularly of a race\r\ndistinguished for fineness of bone, symmetry of form, and early\r\nmaturity--will bring a much higher price at the same age than a calf\r\nsired by a scrub. Blood has a money value, which will, sooner or later,\r\nbe generally appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important object of the farmer is to get the greatest\r\nreturn in money for his labor and his produce; and it is for his\r\ninterest to obtain an animal--a calf, for example--that will yield the\r\nlargest profit on the outlay. If a calf, for which the original outlay\r\nwas five dollars, will bring at the same age and on the same keep more\r\nreal net profit than another, the original outlay for which was not\r\ntwenty-five cents, it is certainly for the farmer's interest to make the\r\nheavier original outlay and thus secure the superior animal. Setting all\r\nfancy aside, it is merely a question of dollars and cents; but one thing\r\nis certain--and that is, that no farmer can afford to keep poor stock.\r\nIt eats as much, and requires nearly the same amount of care and\r\nattention, as stock of the best quality; while it is equally certain\r\nthat stock of ever so good a quality, whether grade, native, or\r\nthorough-bred, will be sure to deteriorate and sink to the level of poor\r\nstock by neglect and want of proper attention.\r\n\r\nHow, then, is our stock to be improved? Not, certainly, by that\r\nindiscriminate crossing, with a total disregard of all well-established\r\nprinciples, which has thus far marked our efforts with foreign stock,\r\nand which is one prominent reason why so little improvement has been\r\nmade in our dairies; nor by leaving all the results to chance, when, by\r\na careful and judicious selection, they may be within our own control.\r\n\r\nWe want cattle for distinct purposes, as for milk, beef, or labor. In a\r\nlarge majority of cases--especially in the dairy districts, at least,\r\ncomprising the Eastern and Middle States--the farmer cares more for the\r\nmilking qualities of his cows, especially for the quantity they give,\r\nthan for their fitness for grazing, or aptness to fatten. These latter\r\npoints become more important in the Western and some of the Southern\r\nStates, where much greater attention is paid to breeding and to feeding,\r\nand where comparatively slight attention is given to the productions of\r\nthe dairy. A stock of cattle which would suit one farmer might be wholly\r\nunsuited to another, and in such particular case the breeder should have\r\nsome special object in view, and select his animals with reference to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some well-defined general principles that apply to\r\nbreeding everywhere, and which, in many cases, are not thoroughly\r\nunderstood. To these attention will now be directed.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important of the laws to be considered in this\r\nconnection is that of _similarity_. It is by virtue of this law that the\r\npeculiar characters, properties, and qualities of the parents--whether\r\nexternal or internal, good or bad, healthy or diseased--are transmitted\r\nto their offspring. This is one of the plainest and most certain of the\r\nlaws of nature. The lesson which it teaches may be stated in five\r\nwords:--Breed only from the best.\r\n\r\nJudicious selection is indispensable to success in breeding, and this\r\nshould have regard to every particular--general appearance, length of\r\nlimb, shape of carcass, development of chest; in cattle, to the size,\r\nshape, and position of the udder, thickness of skin, touch, length and\r\ntexture of hair, docility, and all those points which go to make up the\r\ndesirable animal.\r\n\r\nNot only should care be exercised to avoid _structural defects_, but\r\nespecially to secure freedom from _hereditary diseases_; as both defects\r\nand diseases appear to be more easily transmissible than desirable\r\nqualities. There is, oftentimes, no obvious peculiarity of structure or\r\nappearance which suggests the possession of diseases or defects which\r\nare transmissible; and for this reason, special care and continued\r\nacquaintance are requisite in order to be assured of their absence in\r\nbreeding animals; but such a tendency, although invisible or\r\ninappreciable to careless observers, must still, judging from its\r\neffects, have as real and certain an existence as any peculiarity of\r\nform or color.\r\n\r\nIn neat cattle, hereditary diseases do not usually show themselves at\r\nbirth; and sometimes the tendency remains latent for many years, perhaps\r\nthrough one or two generations, and afterward breaks out with all its\r\nformer severity. The diseases which are found hereditary in cattle are\r\nscrofula, consumption, dysentery, diarrhoea, rheumatism, and malignant\r\ntumors. As these animals are less exposed to the exciting causes of\r\ndisease, and less liable to be overtasked or subjected to violent\r\nchanges of temperature, or otherwise put in jeopardy, their diseases are\r\nnot so numerous as those of the horse, and what they have are less\r\nviolent, and generally of a chronic character.\r\n\r\nWith regard to hereditary diseases, it is eminently true that \"an ounce\r\nof prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" As a general and almost\r\ninvariable rule, animals possessing either defects or a tendency to\r\ndisease, should not be employed for breeding. If, however, for special\r\nreasons it seems desirable to breed from one which has some slight\r\ndefect of symmetry, or a faint tendency to disease--although for the\r\nlatter it is doubtful whether the possession of any good qualities can\r\nfully compensate--it should be mated with one which excels in every\r\nrespect in which it is itself deficient, and on no account with one\r\nwhich is near of kin to it.\r\n\r\nThere is another law, by which that of similarity is greatly\r\nmodified--the law of _Variation_ or divergence.\r\n\r\nAll animals possess a certain flexibility or pliancy of organization,\r\nwhich renders them capable of change to a greater or less extent. When\r\nin a state of nature, variations are comparatively slow and infrequent;\r\nbut when in a state of domestication they occur much oftener and to a\r\nmuch greater extent. The greater variability in the latter case is\r\ndoubtless owing, in some measure, to our domestic productions' being\r\nreared under conditions of life not so uniform as, and different from,\r\nthose to which the parent species was exposed in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nAmong what are usually reckoned the more active causes of variation may\r\nbe named _climate_, _food_, and _habit_. Animals in a cold climate are\r\nprovided with a thicker covering of hair than in warmer ones. Indeed, it\r\nis said that in some of the tropical provinces of South America, there\r\nare cattle which have an extremely rare and fine fur, in place of the\r\nordinary pile of hair. The supply of food, whether abundant or scanty,\r\nis one of the most efficient causes of variation known to be within the\r\ncontrol of man. A due consideration of the natural effects of climate\r\nand food is a point worthy the careful attention of the\r\nstock-husbandman. If the breeds employed be well adapted to the\r\nsituation, and the capacity of the soil be such as to feed them fully,\r\nprofit may be safely anticipated. Animals are to be regarded as machines\r\nfor converting herbage into money.\r\n\r\nThe bestowal of food sufficient, both in amount and quality, to enable\r\nanimals to develop all the excellencies inherent in them, and yield all\r\nthe profit of which they are capable, is something quite distinct from\r\nundue forcing of pampering. The latter process may produce wonderful\r\nanimals to look at, but neither useful nor profitable ones, and there is\r\ndanger of thus producing a most undesirable variation, since in animals\r\nthe process may be carried far enough to produce barrenness. Instances\r\nare not wanting, particularly among the more recent improved\r\nshort-horns, of impotency among the males and of barrenness among the\r\nfemales; and in some cases where the latter have borne calves, they have\r\nfailed to secrete sufficient milk for their nourishment. Impotency in\r\nbulls of various breeds has, in many instances, occurred from too high\r\nfeeding, especially when connected with a lack of sufficient exercise. A\r\nworking bull, though perhaps not so pleasing to the eye as a fat one, is\r\na surer stock-getter; and his progeny is more likely to inherit full\r\nhealth and vigor.\r\n\r\n_Habit_ has a decided influence toward producing variations. We find in\r\ndomestic animals that use--or the demand created by habit--is met by a\r\ndevelopment or change in the organization adapted to the requirement.\r\nFor instance, with cows in a state of nature, or where required only to\r\nsuckle their young, the supply of milk is barely fitted to the\r\nrequirement. If more is desired, and the milk is drawn completely and\r\nregularly, the yield is increased and continued longer. By keeping up\r\nthe demand there is induced, in the next generation, a greater\r\ndevelopment of the secreting organs, and more milk is given. By\r\ncontinuing the practice, by furnishing the needful conditions of\r\nsuitable food and the like, and by selecting in each generation those\r\nanimals showing the greatest tendency toward milk, a breed specially\r\nadapted for the dairy may be established. It is just by this mode that\r\nthe Ayrshires have, within the past century, been brought to be what\r\nthey are--a breed giving more good milk upon a certain amount of food\r\nthan any other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: READY FOR ACTION.]\r\n\r\nIt is a fact too well established to be controverted, that the first\r\nmale produces impressions upon subsequent progeny by other males. To\r\nwhat extent this principle holds, it is impossible to say. Although the\r\ninstances in which it is known to be of a very marked and obvious\r\ncharacter may be comparatively few, yet there is ample reason to\r\nbelieve that, although in a majority of cases the effect may be less\r\nnoticeable, it is not less real; and it therefore demands the special\r\nattention of breeders. The knowledge of this law furnishes a clue to the\r\ncause of many of the disappointments of which practical breeders often\r\ncomplain, and of many variations otherwise unaccountable, and it\r\nsuggests particular caution as to the first male employed in the\r\ncoupling of animals--a matter which has often been deemed of little\r\nconsequence in regard to cattle, inasmuch as fewer heifers' first calves\r\nare reared, than those are which are borne subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon--or law, as it is sometimes called--of atavism, or\r\n_ancestral influence_, is one of considerable practical importance, and\r\nwell deserves the careful attention of the breeder of farm stock.\r\n\r\nEvery one is aware that it is by no means unusual for a child to\r\nresemble its grandfather, or grandmother, or even some ancestor still\r\nmore remote, more than it does either its own father or mother. The same\r\noccurrence is found among our domestic animals, and oftener in\r\nproportion as the breeds are crossed or mixed up. Among our common stock\r\nof neat cattle, or natives--originating, as they did, from animals\r\nbrought from England, Scotland, Denmark, France, and Spain, each\r\npossessing different characteristics of form, color, and use, and bred,\r\nas our common stock has usually been, indiscriminately together, with no\r\nspecial object in view, with no attempt to obtain any particular type or\r\nform, or to secure adaptation for any particular purpose--frequent\r\nopportunities are afforded of witnessing the results of this law of\r\nhereditary transmission. So common, indeed, is its occurrence, that the\r\nremark is often made, that, however good a cow may be, there is no\r\ntelling beforehand what sort of a calf she may have. The fact is\r\nsufficiently obvious, that certain peculiarities often lie dormant for a\r\ngeneration or two and then reappear in subsequent progeny. Stockmen\r\noften speak of it as \"breeding back,\" or \"crying back.\"\r\n\r\nThe lesson taught by this law is very plain. It shows the importance of\r\nseeking thorough-bred or well-bred animals; and by these terms are\r\nsimply meant such as are descended from a line of ancestors in which for\r\nmany generations the desirable forms, qualities, and characteristics\r\nhave been _uniformly shown_. In such a case, even if ancestral influence\r\ndoes come in play, no material difference appears in the offspring, the\r\nancestors being all essentially alike. From this standpoint we best\r\nperceive in what consists the money value of a good \"pedigree.\" This is\r\nvaluable, in proportion as it shows an animal to be descended, not only\r\nfrom such as are purely of its own race or breed, but also from such\r\nindividuals of that breed as were specially noted for the excellencies\r\nfor which that particular breed is esteemed.\r\n\r\nProbably the most distinctly marked evidence of ancestral influence\r\namong us, is to be found in the ill-begotten, round-headed calves, not\r\ninfrequently dropped by cows of the common mixed kind, which, if killed\r\nearly, make very blue veal, and if allowed to grow up, become\r\nexceedingly profitless and unsatisfactory beasts; the heifers being\r\noften barren, the cows poor milkers, the oxen dull, mulish beasts,\r\nyielding flesh of very dark color, of ill flavor and destitute of fat.\r\n\r\n_The relative influence_ of the male and female parents upon the\r\ncharacteristics of progeny has long been a fruitful subject of\r\ndiscussion among breeders. It is found in experience that progeny\r\nsometimes resembles one parent more than the other--sometimes there is\r\nan apparent blending of the characteristics of both--sometimes a\r\nnoticeable dissimilarity to either, though always more or less\r\nresemblance somewhere--and sometimes the impress of one may be seen upon\r\na portion of the organization of the offspring, and that of the other\r\nparent upon another portion; yet we are not authorized from such\r\ndiscrepancies to conclude that it is a matter of chance; for all of\r\nnature's operations are conducted in accordance with fixed laws, whether\r\nwe be able fully to discover them or not. The same causes always produce\r\nthe same results. In this case, not less than in others, there are,\r\nbeyond all doubt, certain fixed laws; and the varying results which we\r\nsee are easily and sufficiently accounted for by the existence of\r\nconditions or modifying influences not fully open to our observation.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated, on the whole--as a result of the varied investigations\r\nto which this question has given rise--that the evidence, both from\r\nobservation and the testimony of the best practical breeders, goes to\r\nshow that each parent usually contributes certain portions of the\r\norganization to the offspring, and that each has a modifying influence\r\nupon the other. Facts also show that the same parent does not always\r\ncontribute the same portions, but that the order is at times, and not\r\nrarely, reversed. Where animals are of distinct species or breeds,\r\ntransmission is usually found to be in harmony with the principle, that\r\nthe male gives mostly the outward form and locomotive system, and the\r\nfemale chiefly the interior system, constitution and the like. Where\r\nthe parents are of the same breed, it appears that the proportions\r\ncontributed by each are governed, in a large measure, by the condition\r\nof each in regard to age and vigor, or by virtue of individual potency\r\nor superiority of physical endowment. This potency or power of\r\ntransmission, seems to be legitimately connected with high breeding, or\r\nthe concentration of fixed qualities, obtained by continued descent for\r\nmany generations from such only as possess in the highest degree the\r\nqualities desired.\r\n\r\nPractically, the knowledge obtained dictates in a most emphatic manner\r\nthat every stock-grower use his utmost endeavor to obtain the services\r\nof the best sires; that is, the best for the ends and purposes in\r\nview--that he depend chiefly on the sire for outward form and\r\nsymmetry--and that he select dams best calculated to develop the good\r\nqualities of the male, depending chiefly upon these for freedom, from\r\ninternal disease, for hardihood and constitution, and, generally, for\r\nall qualities dependent upon the vital or nutritive system. The neglect\r\nof the qualities of the dam, which is far too common--miserably old and\r\ninferior animals being often employed--cannot be too strongly censured.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the laws which regulate the sex of the progeny very\r\nlittle is known. Many and extensive observations have been made, without\r\nreaching any definite conclusion. Nature seems to have provided that the\r\nnumber of each sex; produced, shall be nearly equal; but by what means\r\nthis result is attained, has not as yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a disputed point, whether the system of _breeding\r\nin-and-in_, or the opposite one of frequent crossing, has the greater\r\ntendency to improve the character of stock This term, in-and-in, is\r\noften very loosely used and as variously understood. Some confine the\r\nphrase to the coupling of those of exactly the same blood, as brothers\r\nand sisters, while others include in it breeding from parents and\r\noffsprings; and others still employ it to embrace those of a more\r\ndistant relationship. For the last, the term breeding-in, or close\r\nbreeding, is generally deemed more suitable.\r\n\r\nThe current opinion is decidedly against the practice of breeding from\r\nany near relatives; it being usually found that degeneracy follows, and\r\noften to a serious degree; but it is not proved that this degeneracy,\r\nalthough very common and even usual, is yet a necessary consequence.\r\nThat ill effects follow, in a majority of cases, is not to be doubted;\r\nbut this is easily and sufficiently accounted for upon quite other\r\ngrounds. Perhaps, however, the following propositions may be safely\r\nstated: That in general practice, with the grades and mixed animals\r\ncommon in the country, _close-breeding should be scrupulously avoided_\r\nas highly detrimental. It is better _always_ to avoid breeding from near\r\nrelatives whenever stock-getters of the same breed and of equal merit\r\ncan be obtained which are not related. Yet, where this is not possible,\r\nor where there is some desirable and clearly defined purpose in view--as\r\nthe fixing and perpetuating of some valuable quality in a particular\r\nanimal not common to the breed--and the breeder possesses the knowledge\r\nand skill needful to accomplish his purpose, and the animals are perfect\r\nin health and development, close breeding may be practised with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe practice of _crossing_, like that of close breeding, has its strong\r\nand its weak side. Judiciously practised, it offers a means of\r\nproviding animals _for the butcher_, often superior to, and more\r\nprofitable than, those of any pure breed. It is also admissible as the\r\nfoundation of a systematic and well-considered attempt to establish a\r\nnew breed. But when crossing is practised injudiciously and\r\nindiscriminately, and especially when so done for the purpose of\r\nprocuring _breeding animals_, it is scarcely less objectionable than\r\ncareless in-and-in breeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SPRIGHTLY YOUTH.]\r\n\r\nThe profitable style of breeding for the great majority of farmers to\r\nadopt, is neither to cross nor to breed from close affinities--except in\r\nrare instances, and for some specific and clearly understood\r\npurpose--but to _breed in the line_; that is, to select the breed or\r\nrace best adapted to fulfil the requirement demanded, whether it be for\r\nthe dairy, for labor, or for such combination of these as can be had\r\nwithout too great a sacrifice of the principal requisite, and then to\r\nprocure a _pure-bred_ male of the kind determined upon, and breed him to\r\nthe females of the herd; and if these be not such as are calculated to\r\ndevelop his qualities, endeavor by purchase or exchange to procure such\r\nas will. Let the progeny of these be bred to another _pure-bred_ male of\r\nthe same breed, but as distantly related to the first as may be. Let\r\nthis plan be faithfully pursued, and, although we cannot, without the\r\nintervention of well-bred females, procure stock purely of the kind\r\ndesired, yet in several generations--if proper care be given to the\r\nselection of males, that each one be such as to retain and improve upon\r\nthe points gained by his predecessor--the stock, for most practical\r\npurposes, will be as good as if thorough-bred. If this plan were\r\ngenerally adopted, and a system of letting or exchanging males\r\nestablished, the cost might be brought within the means of most persons,\r\nand the advantages which would accrue would be almost beyond belief.\r\n\r\nA brief summing-up of the foregoing principles may not be inappropriate\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe law of similarity teaches us to select animals for breeding which\r\npossess the desired forms and qualities in the greatest perfection and\r\nbest combination.\r\n\r\nRegard should be had, not only to the more obvious characteristics, but\r\nalso to such hereditary traits and tendencies as may be hidden from\r\ncursory observation and demand careful and thorough investigation.\r\n\r\nFrom the hereditary nature of all characteristics, whether good or bad,\r\nwe learn the importance of having all desirable qualities _thoroughly\r\ninbred_; or, in other words, so firmly in each generation that the next\r\nis warrantably certain to present nothing worse--that no ill results\r\nfollow from breeding back to some inferior ancestor--that all\r\nundesirable traits or points be, so far as possible, _bred-out_.\r\n\r\nSo important is this consideration, that, in practice, it is decidedly\r\npreferable to employ a male of ordinary external appearance--provided\r\nhis ancestry be all which is desired--rather than a grade, or\r\ncross-bred animal, although the latter be greatly his superior in\r\npersonal beauty.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the law of variation teaches us to avoid, for breeding\r\npurposes, such animals as exhibit variations unfavorable to the purpose\r\nin view; to endeavor to perpetuate every real improvement gained; as\r\nwell as to secure, as far as practicable, the conditions necessary to\r\ninduce or continue any improvement, such as general treatment, food,\r\nclimate, habits, and the like.\r\n\r\nWhere the parents do not possess the perfections desired, selections for\r\ncoupling should be made with critical reference to correcting the faults\r\nor deficiencies of one by corresponding excellencies in the other.\r\n\r\nTo correct defects, too much must not be attempted at once. Pairing\r\nthose very unlike oftener results in loss than gain. Avoid all extremes,\r\nand endeavor by moderate degrees to attain the end desired.\r\n\r\nCrossing, between different breeds, for the purpose of obtaining animals\r\nfor the shambles, may be advantageously practised to a considerable\r\nextent, but not for the production of breeding animals. As a general\r\nrule, cross-bred males should not be employed for propagation, and\r\ncross-bred females should be served by thorough-bred males.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary practice, breeding from near relatives is to be scrupulously\r\navoided. For certain purposes, under certain conditions and\r\ncircumstances, and in the hands of a skillful breeder, it may be\r\npractised with advantage--but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn a large majority of cases--other things being equal--we may expect in\r\nprogeny the outward form and general structure of the sire, together\r\nwith the internal qualities, constitution, and nutritive system of the\r\ndam; each, however, modified by the other.\r\n\r\nParticular care should always be taken that the male by which the dam\r\nfirst becomes pregnant is the best which can be obtained; also, that at\r\nthe time of sexual congress both are in vigorous health.\r\n\r\nBreeding animals should not be allowed to become fat, but always kept in\r\nthrifty condition; and such as are intended for the butcher should never\r\nbe fat but once.\r\n\r\nIn deciding with what breeds to stock a farm, endeavor to select those\r\nbest adapted to its surface, climate, and degree of fertility; also,\r\nwith reference to probable demand and proximity to markets.\r\n\r\nNo expense incurred in procuring choice animals for propagation, no\r\namount of skill in breeding, can supersede, or compensate for, a lack of\r\nliberal feeding and good treatment. The better the stock, the better\r\ncare they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREGNANCY\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of pregnancy in its early stage were formerly deemed\r\nexceedingly unsatisfactory. The period of being in season--which\r\ncommonly lasts three or four days, and then ceases for a while, and\r\nreturns in about three weeks--might entirely pass over; and, although it\r\nwas then probable that conception had taken place, yet in a great many\r\ninstances the hopes of the breeder were disappointed. It was not until\r\nbetween the third and fourth month, when the belly began to enlarge--or,\r\nin many cases, considerably later--and when the motions of the foetus\r\nmight be seen, or, at all events, felt by pressing on the right flank,\r\nthat the farmer could be assured that his cow was in calf.\r\n\r\nThat greatest of improvements in veterinary practice, the application of\r\nthe ear to the chest and belly of various animals, in order to detect by\r\nthe different sounds--which after a short time, will be easily\r\nrecognized--the state of the circulation through most of the organs, and\r\nconsequently, the precise seat and degree of inflammation and danger,\r\nhas now enabled the breeder to ascertain the existence of pregnancy at\r\nas early a stage as six or eight weeks. The beating of the heart of the\r\ncalf may then be distinctly heard, twice, or more than twice, as\r\nfrequent as that of the mother; and each pulsation will betray the\r\nsingular double beating of the foetal heart. This will also be\r\naccompanied by the audible rushing of the blood through the vessels of\r\nthe placenta. The ear should be applied to the right flank, beginning on\r\nthe higher part of it, and gradually shifting downward and backward.\r\nThese sounds will thus soon be heard, and cannot be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT BEFORE CALVING.\r\n\r\nLittle alteration needs to be made in the management of the cow for the\r\nfirst seven months of pregnancy; except that, as she has not only to\r\nyield milk for the profit of the farmer, but to nourish the growing\r\nfoetus within, she should be well, yet not too luxuriantly, fed. The\r\nhalf-starved cow will not adequately discharge this double duty, nor\r\nprovide sufficient nutriment for the calf when it has dropped; while the\r\ncow in high condition will be dangerously disposed to inflammation and\r\nfever, when, at the time of parturition, she is otherwise so\r\nsusceptible of the power of every stimulus. If the season and the\r\nconvenience of the farmer will allow, she will be better at pasture, at\r\nleast for some hours each day than when confined altogether to the\r\ncow-house.\r\n\r\nAt a somewhat uncertain period before she calves, there will be a new\r\nsecretion of milk for the expected little one; and under the notion of\r\nsomewhat recruiting her strength, in order better to enable her to\r\ndischarge her new duty--but more from the uniform testimony of\r\nexperience that there is danger of local inflammation, general fever,\r\ngarget in the udder, and puerperal fever, if the new milk descends while\r\nthe old milk continues to flow--it has been usual to let the cow _go\r\ndry_ for some period before parturition. Farmers and breeders have been\r\nstrangely divided as to the length of this period. It must be decided by\r\ncircumstances. A cow in good condition may be milked for a much longer\r\nperiod than a poor one. Her abundance of food renders a period of\r\nrespite almost unnecessary; and all that needs to be taken care of, is\r\nthat the old milk should be fairly gone before the new milk springs. In\r\nsuch a cow, while there is danger of inflammation from the sudden rush\r\nof new milk into a bag already occupied, there is almost always\r\nconsiderable danger of indurations and tumors in the teats from the\r\nhabit of secretion being too long suspended. The emaciated and\r\nover-milked beast, however, must rest a while before she can again\r\nadvantageously discharge the duties of a mother.\r\n\r\nIf the period of pregnancy were of equal length at all times and in all\r\ncows, the one that has been well fed might be milked until within a\r\nfortnight or three weeks of parturition, while a holiday of two months\r\nshould be granted to the poorer beast; but as there is much\r\nirregularity about the time of gestation, it may be prudent to take a\r\nmonth or five Weeks, as the average period.\r\n\r\nThe process of parturition is necessarily one that is accompanied with a\r\ngreat deal of febrile excitement; and, therefore, when it nearly\r\napproaches, not only should a little care be taken to lessen the\r\nquantity of food, and to remove that which is of a stimulating action,\r\nbut a mild dose of physic, and a bleeding regulated by the condition of\r\nthe animal, will be very proper precautionary measures.\r\n\r\nA moderately open state of the bowels is necessary at the period of\r\nparturition in the cow. During the whole time of pregnancy her enormous\r\nstomach sufficiently presses upon and confines the womb; and that\r\npressure may be productive of injurious and fatal consequences, if at\r\nthis period the rumen is suffered to be distended by innutritious food,\r\nor the manyplus takes on that hardened state to which it is occasionally\r\nsubject. Breeders have been sadly negligent in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe springing of the udder, or the rapid enlargement of it from the\r\nrenewed secretion of milk--the enlargement of the external parts of the\r\nbearing (the former, as has been said by some, in old cows, and the\r\nlatter in young ones)--the appearance of a glaring discharge from the\r\nbearing--the evident dropping of the belly, with the appearance of\r\nleanness and narrowness between the shape and the udder--a degree of\r\nuneasiness and fidgetiness--moaning occasionally--accelerated\r\nrespiration--all these symptoms will announce that the time of calving\r\nis not far off. The cow should be brought near home, and put in some\r\nquiet, sheltered place. In cold or stormy weather she should be housed.\r\nHer uneasiness will rapidly increase--she will be continually getting up\r\nand lying down--her tail will begin to be elevated and the commencement\r\nof the labor-pains will soon be evident.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the parturition will be natural and easy, and the less the\r\ncow is disturbed or meddled with, the better. She will do better without\r\nhelp than with it; but she should be watched, in order to see that no\r\ndifficulty occurs which may require aid and attention. In cases of\r\ndifficult parturition the aid of a skillful veterinary surgeon may be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFeeding and Management\r\n\r\n\r\nNo branch of dairy farming can compare in importance with the management\r\nof cows. The highest success will depend upon it, whatever breed be\r\nselected, and whatever amount of care and attention be given to the\r\npoints of the animals; for experience will show that very little milk\r\ncomes out of the bag, that is not first put into the throat. It is poor\r\neconomy, therefore, to attempt to keep too many cows for the amount of\r\nfeed one has; for it will generally be found that one good cow well-bred\r\nand well fed will yield as much as two ordinary cows kept in the\r\nordinary way; while a saving is effected both in labor and room\r\nrequired, and in the risks on the capital invested. If an argument for\r\nthe larger number on poorer feed is urged on the ground of the\r\nadditional manure--which is the only basis upon which it can be put--it\r\nis enough to say that it is a very expensive way of making manure. It is\r\nnot too strong an assertion, that a proper regard to profit and economy\r\nwould require many an American farmer to sell off nearly half of his\r\ncows, and to feed the whole of his hay and roots hitherto used into the\r\nremainder.\r\n\r\nAn animal, to be fully fed and satisfied, requires a quantity of food in\r\nproportion to its live weight. No feed is complete that does not contain\r\na sufficient amount of nutritive elements; hay, for example, being more\r\nnutritive than straw, and grains than roots. The food, too, must possess\r\na bulk sufficient to fill up to a certain degree the organs of digestion\r\nof the stomach; and, to receive the full benefit of its food, the animal\r\nmust be wholly satisfied--since, if the stomach is not sufficiently\r\ndistended, the food cannot be properly digested, and of course many of\r\nthe nutritive principles which it contains cannot be perfectly\r\nassimilated. An animal regularly fed eats till it is satisfied, and no\r\nmore than is requisite. A part of the nutritive elements in hay and\r\nother forage plants is needed to keep an animal on its feet--that is, to\r\nkeep up its condition--and if the nutrition of its food is insufficient\r\nfor this, the weight decreases, and if it is more than sufficient the\r\nweight increases, or else this excess is consumed in the production of\r\nmilk or in labor. About one sixtieth of their live weight in hay, or its\r\nequivalent, will keep horned cattle on their feet; but, in order to be\r\ncompletely nourished, they require about one thirtieth in dry\r\nsubstances, and four thirtieths in water, or other liquid contained in\r\ntheir food. The excess of nutritive food over and above what is\r\nnecessary to sustain life will go, in milch cows, generally to the\r\nproduction of milk, or to the growth of the foetus, but not in all\r\ncows to an equal extent; the tendency to the secretion of milk being\r\nmuch more developed in some than in others.\r\n\r\nWith regard, however, to the consumption of food in proportion to the\r\nlive weight of the animal, it must be taken, in common with all general\r\nprinciples, with some qualifications. The proportion is probably not\r\nuniform as applied to all breeds indiscriminately, though it may be more\r\nso as applied to animals of the same breed. The idea of some celebrated\r\nstock-raisers has been that the quantity of food required depends much\r\nupon the shape of the barrel; and it is well known that an animal of a\r\nclose, compact, well-rounded barrel, will consume less than one of an\r\nopposite make.\r\n\r\nThe variations in the yield of milch cows are caused more by the\r\nvariations in the nutritive elements of their food than by a change of\r\nthe form in which it is given. A cow, kept through the winter on mere\r\nstraw, will cease to give milk; and, when fed in spring on green forage,\r\nwill give a fair quantity of milk. But she owes the cessation and\r\nrestoration of the secretion, respectively, to the diminution and\r\nincrease of her nourishment, and not at all to the change of form, or of\r\noutward substance in which the nutriment is administered. Let cows\r\nreceive through winter nearly as large a proportion of nutritive matter\r\nas is contained in the clover, lucerne, and fresh grass which they eat\r\nin summer, and, no matter in what precise substance or mixture that\r\nmatter be contained, they will yield a winter's produce of milk quite as\r\nrich in caseine and butyraceous ingredients as the summer's produce, and\r\nfar more ample in quantity than almost any dairyman with old-fashioned\r\nnotions would imagine to be possible. The great practical error on this\r\nsubject consists, not in giving wrong kinds of food, but in not so\r\nproportioning and preparing it as to render an average ration of it\r\nequally rich in the elements of nutrition, and especially in nitrogenous\r\nelements, as an average ration of the green and succulent food of\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nWe keep too much stock for the quantity of good and nutritious food\r\nwhich we have for it; and the consequence is, that cows are, in nine\r\ncases out of ten, poorly wintered, and come out in the spring weakened,\r\nif not, indeed, positively diseased, and a long time is required to\r\nbring them into a condition to yield a generous quantity of milk.\r\n\r\nIt is a hard struggle for a cow reduced in flesh and in blood to fill up\r\nthe wasted system with the food which would otherwise have gone to the\r\nsecretion of milk; but, if she is well fed, well housed, well littered,\r\nand well supplied with pure, fresh water, and with roots, or other\r\n_moist_ food, and properly treated to the luxury of a frequent carding,\r\nand constant kindness, she comes out ready to commence the manufacture\r\nof milk under favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Keep the cows constantly in good condition_, ought, therefore, to be\r\nthe motto of every dairy farmer, posted up over the barn, and on and\r\nover the stalls, and over the milk-room, and repeated to the boys\r\nwhenever there is danger of forgetting it. It is the great secret of\r\nsuccess; and the difference between success and failure turns upon it.\r\nCows in milk require more food in proportion to their size and weight\r\nthan either oxen or young cattle.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep cows in milk well and economically, regularity is next\r\nin importance to a full supply of wholesome and nutritious food. The\r\nanimal stomach is a very nice chronometer, and it is of the utmost\r\nimportance to observe regular hours in feeding, cleaning, and milking.\r\nThis is a point, also, in which very many farmers are at fault--feeding\r\nwhenever it happens to be convenient. The cattle are thus kept in a\r\nrestless condition, constantly expecting food when the keeper enters the\r\nbarn; while, if regular hours are strictly adhered to, they know exactly\r\nwhen they are to be fed, and they rest quietly till the time arrives. If\r\none goes into any well-regulated dairy establishment an hour before\r\nfeeding, scarcely an animal will rise to its feet; while; if it happens\r\nto be the hour of feeding, the whole herd will be likely to rise and\r\nseize their food with an avidity and relish not to be mistaken.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the exact nurture to be pursued, no rule could be\r\nprescribed which would apply to all cases; and each individual must be\r\ngoverned much by circumstances, both regarding the particular kinds of\r\nfeed at different seasons of the year, and the system of feeding. It has\r\nbeen found--it may be stated--in the practice of the most successful\r\ndairymen, that, in order to encourage the largest secretion of milk in\r\nstalled cows, one of the best courses is, to feed in the morning, either\r\nat the time of milking--which is preferred by many--or immediately\r\nafter, with cut feed, consisting of hay, oats, millet, or cornstalks,\r\nmixed with shorts, and Indian linseed, or cotton-seed meal, thoroughly\r\nmoistened with water. If in winter, hot or warm water is far better than\r\ncold. If given at milking-time, the cows will generally give down their\r\nmilk more readily. The stalls and mangers should first be thoroughly\r\ncleansed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FAMILY PETS.]\r\n\r\nRoots and long hay may be given during the day; and at the evening\r\nmilking, or directly after, another generous meal of cut feed, well\r\nmoistened and mixed, as in the morning. No very concentrated food, like\r\ngrains alone, or oil-cakes, should be fed early in the morning on an\r\nempty stomach, although it is sanctioned by the practice in the London\r\nmilk-dairies. The processes of digestion go on best when the stomach is\r\nsufficiently distended; and for this purpose the bulk of food is almost\r\nas important as the nutritive qualities. The flavor of some roots, as\r\ncabbages and turnips, is more apt to be imparted to the flesh and milk\r\nwhen fed on an empty stomach than otherwise. After the cows have been\r\nmilked and have finished their cut feed, they are carded and curried\r\ndown, in well-managed dairies, and then either watered in the\r\nstall--which, in very cold or stormy weather, is far preferable--or\r\nturned out to water in the yard. While they are out, if they are let out\r\nat all, the stables are put in order; and, after tying them up, they are\r\nfed with long hay, and left to themselves till the next feeding time.\r\nThis may consist of roots--such as cabbages, beets, carrots, or\r\nturnips sliced--or of potatoes, a peck, or--if the cows are very\r\nlarge--a half-bushel each, and cut feed again at the evening milking, as\r\nin the morning; after which, water in the stall, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe less cows are exposed to the cold of winter, the better. They eat\r\nless, thrive better, and give more milk, when kept housed all the time,\r\nthan when exposed to the cold. A case is on record, where a herd of\r\ncows, which had usually been supplied from troughs and pipes in the\r\nstalls, were, on account of an obstruction in the pipes, obliged to be\r\nturned out thrice a day to be watered in the yard. The quantity of milk\r\ninstantly decreased, and in three days the diminution became very\r\nconsiderable. After the pipes were mended, and the cows again watered,\r\nas before, in their stalls, the flow of milk returned. This, however,\r\nmust be governed much by the weather; for in very mild and warm days it\r\nmay be judicious not only to let them out, but to allow them to remain\r\nout for a short time, for the purpose of exercise.\r\n\r\nAny one can arrange the hour for the several processes named above, to\r\nsuit himself; but, when once fixed, it should be rigidly and regularly\r\nfollowed. If the regular and full feeding be neglected for even a day,\r\nthe yield of milk will immediately decline, and it will be very\r\ndifficult to restore it. It may be safely asserted, as the result of\r\nmany trials and long practice, that a larger flow of milk follows a\r\ncomplete system of regularity in this respect than from a higher feeding\r\nwhere this system is not adhered to.\r\n\r\nOne prime object which the dairyman should keep constantly in view is,\r\nto maintain the animal in a sound and healthy condition. Without this,\r\nno profit can be expected from a milch cow for any considerable length\r\nof time; and with a view to this, there should be an occasional change\r\nof food. But, in making changes, great care is requisite in order to\r\nsupply the needful amount of nourishment, or the cow will fall off in\r\nflesh, and eventually in milk. It should, therefore, be remembered that\r\nthe food consumed goes not alone to the secretion of milk, but also to\r\nthe growth and maintenance of the bony structure, the flesh, the blood,\r\nthe fat, the skin, and the hair, and in exhalations from the body. These\r\nparts of the body consist of different organic constituents. Some are\r\nrich in nitrogen, as the fibrin of the blood and albumen; others\r\ndestitute of it, as fat; some abound in inorganic salts, phosphate of\r\nlime, and salts of potash. To explain how the constant waste of these\r\nsubstances may be supplied, a celebrated chemist observes that the\r\nalbumen, gluten, caseine, and other nitrogenized principles of food,\r\nsupply the animal with the materials requisite for the formation of\r\nmuscle and cartilage; they are, therefore, called flesh-forming\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nFats, or oily matters of the food, are used to lay on fat, or for the\r\npurpose of sustaining respiration.\r\n\r\nStarch, sugar, gum, and a few other non-nitrogenized substances,\r\nconsisting of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, supply the carbon given off\r\nin respiration, or they are used for the production of fat.\r\n\r\nPhosphate of lime and magnesia in food principally furnish the animal\r\nwith the materials of which the bony skeleton of its body consists.\r\n\r\nSaline substances--chlorides of sodium and potassium, sulphate and\r\nphosphate of potash and soda, and some other mineral matters occurring\r\nin food--supply the blood, juice of flesh, and various animal juices,\r\nwith the necessary mineral constituents.\r\n\r\nThe healthy state of an animal can thus only be preserved by a mixed\r\nfood; that is, food which contains all the proximate principles just\r\nnoticed. Starch or sugar alone cannot sustain the animal body, since\r\nneither of them furnishes the materials to build up the fleshy parts of\r\nthe animal. When fed on substances in which an insufficient quantity of\r\nphosphates occurs, the animal will become weak, because it does not find\r\nany bone-producing principle in its food. Due attention should,\r\ntherefore, be paid by the feeder to the selection of food which contains\r\nall the kinds of matter required, nitrogenized as well as\r\nnon-nitrogenized, and mineral substances; and these should be mixed\r\ntogether in the proportion which experience points out as best for the\r\ndifferent kinds of animals, or the particular purpose for which they are\r\nkept.\r\n\r\nRelative to the nutrition of cows for dairy purposes, milk may be\r\nregarded as a material for the manufacture of butter and cheese; and,\r\naccording to the purpose for which the milk is intended to be employed,\r\nwhether for the manufacture of butter or the production of cheese, the\r\ncow should be differently fed.\r\n\r\nButter contains carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, and no nitrogen. Cheese,\r\non the contrary, is rich in nitrogen. Food which contains much fatty\r\nmatter, or substances which in the animal system are readily converted\r\ninto fat, will tend to increase the proportion of cream in milk. On the\r\nother hand, the proportion of caseine or cheesy matter in milk is\r\nincreased by the use of highly nitrogenized food. Those, then, who\r\ndesire much cream, or who produce cream for the manufacture of butter,\r\nselect food likely to increase the proportion of butter in the milk. On\r\nthe contrary, where the principal object is the production of milk rich\r\nin curd--that is, where cheese is the object of the farmer--clover,\r\npeas, bran-meal, and other plants which abound in legumine--a\r\nnitrogenized organic compound, almost identical in properties and\r\ncomposition with caseine, or the substance which forms the curd of\r\nmilk--will be selected.\r\n\r\nAnd so the quality, as well as the quantity, of butter in the milk,\r\ndepends on the kind of food consumed and on the general health of the\r\nanimal. Cows fed on turnips in the stall always produce butter inferior\r\nto that of cows living upon the fresh and aromatic grasses of the\r\npastures.\r\n\r\nSucculent food in which water abounds--the green grass of irrigated\r\nmeadows, green clover, brewers' and distillers' refuse, and the\r\nlike--increases the quantity, rather than the quality, of the milk; and\r\nby feeding these substances the milk-dairyman studies his own interest,\r\nand makes thin milk without diluting it with water--though, in the\r\nopinion of some, this may be no more legitimate than watering the milk.\r\n\r\nBut, though the yield of milk may be increased by succulent or watery\r\nfood, it should be given so as not to interfere with the health of the\r\ncow.\r\n\r\nFood rich in starch, gum, or sugar, which are the respiratory elements,\r\nan excess of which goes to the production of fatty matters, increases\r\nthe butter in milk. Quietness promotes the secretion of fat in animals\r\nand increases the butter. Cheese will be increased by food rich in\r\nalbumen, such as the leguminous plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUYING CATTLE.]\r\n\r\nThe most natural, and of course the healthiest, food for milch cows in\r\nsummer, is the green grass of the pastures; and when these fail from\r\ndrought or over-stocking, the complement of nourishment may be made up\r\nwith green clover, green oats, barley, millet, or corn-fodder and\r\ncabbage-leaves, or other succulent vegetables; and if these are wanting,\r\nthe deficiency may be partly supplied with shorts, Indian-meal, linseed\r\nor cotton-seed meal. Green grass is more nutritious than hay, which\r\nalways loses somewhat of its nutritive properties in curing; the amount\r\nof the loss depending chiefly on the mode of curing, and the length of\r\nexposure to sun and rain. But, apart from this, grass is more easily and\r\ncompletely digested than hay, though the digestion of the latter may be\r\ngreatly aided by cutting and moistening, or steaming; and by this means\r\nit is rendered more readily available, and hence far better adapted to\r\npromote a large secretion of milk--a fact too often overlooked even by\r\nmany intelligent farmers.\r\n\r\nIn autumn, the best feed will be the grasses of the pastures, so far as\r\nthey are available, green-corn fodder, cabbage, carrot, and turnip\r\nleaves, and an addition of meal or shorts. Toward the middle of autumn,\r\nthe cows fed in the pastures will require to be housed regularly at\r\nnight, especially in the more northern latitudes, and put, in part at\r\nleast, upon hay. But every farmer knows that it is not judicious to feed\r\nout the best part of his hay when his cattle are first put into the\r\nbarn, and that he should not feed so well in the early part of winter\r\nthat he cannot feed better as the winter advances.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it should always be borne in mind that the change from\r\ngrass to a poor quality of hay or straw, for cows in milk, should not be\r\ntoo sudden. A poor quality of dry hay is far less palatable in the early\r\npart of winter, after the cows are taken from grass, than at a later\r\nperiod; and, if it is resorted to with milch cows, will invariably lead\r\nto a falling off in the milk, which no good feed can afterward wholly\r\nrestore.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable, therefore, for the farmer to know what can be used\r\ninstead of his best English or upland meadow hay, and yet not suffer any\r\ngreater loss in the flow of milk, or in condition, than is absolutely\r\nnecessary. In some sections of the Eastern States, the best quality of\r\nswale hay will be used; and the composition of that is as variable as\r\npossible, depending on the varieties of the grasses of which it was\r\nmade, and the manner of curing. But, in other sections, many will find\r\nit necessary to use straw and other substitutes. Taking good English or\r\nmeadow hay as the standard of comparison, and calling that one, 4.79\r\ntimes the weight of rye-straw, or 3.83 times the weight of oat-straw,\r\ncontains the same amount of nutritive matter; that is, it would take\r\n4.79 times as good rye-straw to produce the same result as good meadow\r\nhay.\r\n\r\nIn winter, the best food for cows in milk will be good sweet meadow hay,\r\na part of which should be cut and moistened with water--as all inferior\r\nhay or straw should be--with an addition of root-crops, such as turnips,\r\ncarrots, parsnips, potatoes, mangold-wurtzel, with shorts, oil-cake,\r\nIndian meal, or bean meal.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of most successful dairymen that the feeding of moist\r\nfood cannot be too highly recommended for cows in milk, especially to\r\nthose who desire to obtain the largest quantity. Hay cut and thoroughly\r\nmoistened becomes more succulent and nutritive, and partakes more of the\r\nnature of green grass.\r\n\r\nAs a substitute for the oil-cake, hitherto known as an exceedingly\r\nvaluable article for feeding stock, there is probably nothing better\r\nthan cotton-seed meal. This is an article whose economic value has been\r\nbut recently made known, but which, from practical trials already made,\r\nhas proved eminently successful as food for milch cows. Chemists have\r\ndecided that its composition is not inferior to that of the best\r\nflaxseed cake, and that in some respects its agricultural value\r\nsurpasses that of any other kind of oil-cake.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked by chemists, in this connection, that the great\r\nvalue of linseed-cake, as an adjunct to hay, for fat cattle and milch\r\ncows, has been long recognized; and that it is undeniably traceable, in\r\nthe main, to three ingredients of the seeds of the oil-yielding plants.\r\nThe value of food depends upon the quantities of matters it contains\r\nwhich may be appropriated by the animal which consumes the food Now, it\r\nis proved that the fat of animals is derived from the starch, gum, and\r\nsugar, and more directly and easily from the oil of the food. These four\r\nsubstances, then, are fat-formers. The muscles, nerves, and tendons of\r\nanimals, the brine of their blood and the curd of their milk, are almost\r\nidentical in composition with, and strongly similar in many of their\r\nproperties to, matters found in all vegetables, but chiefly in such as\r\nform the most concentrated food. These blood (and muscle) formers are\r\ncharacterized by containing about fifteen and a half per cent. of\r\nnitrogen; and hence are called nitrogenous substances. They are, also,\r\noften designated as the albuminous bodies.\r\n\r\nThe bony framework of the animal owes its solidity to phosphate of lime,\r\nand this substance must be furnished by the food. A perfect food must\r\nsupply the animal with these three classes of bodies, and in proper\r\nproportions. The addition of a small quantity of a food, rich in oil and\r\nalbuminous substances, to the ordinary kinds of feed, which contain a\r\nlarge quantity of vegetable fibre or woody matter, more or less\r\nindigestible, but, nevertheless, indispensable to the herbivorous\r\nanimals, their digestive organs being adapted to a bulky food, has been\r\nfound highly advantageous in practice. Neither hay alone nor\r\nconcentrated food alone gives the best results. A certain combination of\r\nthe two presents the most advantages.\r\n\r\nSome who have used cotton-seed cake have found difficulty in inducing\r\ncattle to eat it. By giving it at first in small doses, mixed with other\r\npalatable food, they soon learn to eat it with relish. Cotton-seed cake\r\nis much richer in oils and albuminous matters than the linseed cake. A\r\ncorrespondingly less quantity will therefore be required. Three pounds\r\nof this cotton-seed cake are equivalent to four of linseed cake of\r\naverage quality.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter season, as has been already remarked, a frequent\r\nchange of food is especially necessary, both as contributions to the\r\ngeneral health of animals, and as a means of stimulating the digestive\r\norgans, and thus increasing the secretion of milk. A mixture used as cut\r\nfeed and well moistened is now especially beneficial, since concentrated\r\nfood, which would otherwise be given in small quantities, may be united\r\nwith larger quantities of coarser and less nutritive food, and the\r\ncomplete assimilation of the whole be better secured. On this subject it\r\nhas been sensibly observed that the most nutritious kinds of food\r\nproduce little or no effect when they are not digested by the stomach,\r\nor if the digested food is not absorbed by the lymphatic vessels, and\r\nnot assimilated by the various parts of the body. Now, the normal\r\nfunctions of the digestive organs not only depend upon the composition\r\nof the food, but also on its volume. The volume or bulk of the food\r\ncontributes to the healthy action of the digestive organs, by exercising\r\na stimulating effect upon the nerves which govern them. Thus the whole\r\norganization of ruminating animals necessitates the supply of bulky\r\nfood, to keep the animal in good condition.\r\n\r\nFeed sweet and nutritious food, therefore, frequently, regularly, and in\r\nsmall quantities, and change it often, and the best results may be\r\nconfidently anticipated. If the cows are not in milk, but are to come in\r\nin the spring, the difference in feeding should be rather in the\r\nquantity than the quality, if the highest yield is to be expected from\r\nthem during the coming season.\r\n\r\nThe most common feeding is hay alone, and oftentimes very poor hay at\r\nthat. The main point is to keep the animal in a healthy and thriving\r\ncondition, and not to suffer her to fail in flesh; and with this object,\r\nsome change and variety of food are highly important.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALLING IN THE CATTLE.]\r\n\r\nToward the close of winter, a herd of cows will begin to come in, or\r\napproach their time of calving. Care should then be taken not to feed\r\ntoo rich or stimulating food for the last week or two before this event,\r\nas it is often attended with ill consequences. A plenty of hay, a few\r\npotatoes or shorts, and pure water will suffice.\r\n\r\nIn spring, the best feeding for dairy cows will be much the same as that\r\nfor winter; the roots in store over winter, such as carrots, mangold\r\nwurtzel, turnips, and parsnips, furnishing very valuable aid in\r\nincreasing the quantity and improving the quality of milk. Toward the\r\nclose of this season, and before the grass of pastures is sufficiently\r\ngrown to make it judicious to turn out the cows, the best dairymen\r\nprovide a supply of green fodder in the shape of winter rye, which, if\r\ncut while it is tender and succulent, and before it is half grown, will\r\nbe greatly relished. Unless cut young, however, its stalk soon becomes\r\nhard and unpalatable.\r\n\r\nAll practical dairymen agree in saying that a warm and well-ventilated\r\nbarn is indispensable to the promotion of the highest yield of milk in\r\nwinter; and most agree that cows in milk should not be turned out, even\r\nto drink, in cold weather; all exposure to cold tending to lessen the\r\nyield of milk.\r\n\r\nIn the London dairies, in which, of course, the cows are fed so as to\r\nproduce the largest flow of milk, the treatment is as follows: The cows\r\nare kept at night in stalls. About three A. M. each has a half-bushel of\r\ngrains. When milking is finished, each receives a bushel of turnips (or\r\nmangolds), and shortly afterward, one tenth of a truss of hay of the\r\nbest quality. This feeding occurs before eight A. M., when the animals\r\nare turned into the yard. Four hours after, they are again tied up in\r\ntheir stalls, and have another feed of grains. When the afternoon\r\nmilking is over (about three P. M.), they are fed with a bushel of\r\nturnips, and after the lapse of an hour, hay is given them as before.\r\nThis mode of feeding usually continues throughout the cool season, or\r\nfrom November to March. During the remaining months they are fed with\r\ngrains, tares, and cabbages, and a proportion of rowen, or second-cut\r\nhay. They are supplied regularly until they are turned out to grass,\r\nwhen they pass the whole of the night in the field. The yield is about\r\nsix hundred and fifty gallons a year for each cow.\r\n\r\nMr. Harley--whose admirable dairy establishment was erected for the\r\npurpose of supplying the city of Glasgow with a good quality of milk,\r\nand which has contributed more than any thing else to improve the\r\nquality of the milk furnished to all the principal cities of Great\r\nBritain--adopted the following system of feeding with the greatest\r\nprofit: In the early part of the summer, young grass and green barley,\r\nthe first cutting especially, mixed with a large proportion of old hay\r\nor straw, and a good quantity of salt to prevent swelling, were used. As\r\nsummer advanced, less hay and straw were given, and as the grass\r\napproached ripeness, they were discontinued altogether; but young and\r\nwet clover was never given without an admixture of dry provender. When\r\ngrass became scarce, young turnips and turnip leaves were steamed with\r\nhay, and formed a good substitute. As grass decreased, the turnips were\r\nincreased, and at length became a complete substitute. As the season\r\nadvanced, a large proportion of distillers' grains and wash was given\r\nwith other food, but these were found to have a tendency to make the\r\ncattle grain-sick; and if this feeding were long-continued, the health\r\nof the cows became affected. Boiled linseed and short-cut wheat straw\r\nmixed with the grains, were found to prevent the cows from turning sick.\r\nAs spring approached, Swedish turnips, when cheap, were substituted for\r\nyellow turnips. These two roots, steamed with hay and other mixtures,\r\nafforded safe food till grass was again in season. When any of the cows\r\nwere surfeited, the food was withheld till the appetite returned, when a\r\nsmall quantity was given, and increased gradually to the full allowance.\r\n\r\nBut the most elaborate and valuable experiments in the feeding and\r\nmanagement of milch cows, are those made, not long since, by Mr. T.\r\nHorsfall, of England, and published in the Journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society. His practice, though adapted more especially,\r\nperhaps, to his own section, is nevertheless of such general application\r\nand importance as to be worthy of attention. By his course of treatment\r\nhe found that he could produce as much and as rich butter in winter as\r\nin summer.\r\n\r\nHis first object was to afford a full supply of the elements of food\r\nadapted to the maintenance, and also to the produce of the animal; and\r\nthis could not be effected by the ordinary food and methods of feeding,\r\nsince it is impossible to induce a cow to consume a quantity of hay\r\nrequisite to supply the waste of the system, and keep up, at the same\r\ntime, a full yield of the best quality of milk. He used, to some extent,\r\ncabbages, kohl rabi, mangolds, shorts, and other substances, rich in the\r\nconstituents of cheese and butter. \"My food for milch cows,\" says he,\r\n\"after having undergone various modifications, has for two seasons\r\nconsisted of rape cake five pounds, and bran two pounds, for each cow,\r\nmixed with a sufficient quantity of bean-straw, oat-straw, and shells of\r\noats, in equal proportions, to supply them three times a day with as\r\nmuch as they will eat. The whole of the materials are moistened and\r\nblended together, and, after being well steamed, are given to the animal\r\nin a warm state. The attendant is allowed one pound to one pound and a\r\nhalf per cow, according to circumstances, of bean-meal, which he is\r\ncharged to give to each cow in proportion to the yield of milk; those in\r\nfull milk getting each two pounds per day, others but little. It is dry,\r\nand mixed with the steamed food on its being dealt out separately. When\r\nthis is eaten up, green food is given, consisting of cabbages, from\r\nOctober to December, kohl rabi till February, and mangold till grass\r\ntime, with a view to nicety of flavor. I limit the quantity of green\r\nfood to thirty or thirty-five pounds per day for each. After each feed,\r\nfour pounds of meadow hay, or twelve pounds per day, is given to each\r\ncow. They are allowed water twice a day, to the extent which they will\r\ndrink.\"\r\n\r\nBean-straw uncooked having been found to be hard and unpalatable, it was\r\nsteamed to make it soft and pulpy, when it possessed an agreeable odor,\r\nand imparted its flavor to the whole mass. It was cut for this purpose\r\njust before ripening, but after the bean was fully grown, and in this\r\nstate was found to possess nearly double the amount of albuminous\r\nmatter, so valuable to milch cows, of good meadow or upland hay. Bran or\r\nshorts is also vastly improved by steaming or soaking with hot water,\r\nwhen its nutriment is more readily assimilated. It contains about\r\nfourteen per cent. of albumen, and is rich in phosphoric acid. Rape-cake\r\nwas found to be exceedingly valuable. Linseed and cotton-seed cake may\r\nprobably be substituted for it in this country.\r\n\r\nMr. Horsfall turned his cows in May into a rich pasture, housing them at\r\nnight, and giving them a mess of the steamed mixture and some hay\r\nmorning and night; and from June to October they had cut grass in the\r\nstall, besides what they got in the pasture, and two feeds of the\r\nsteamed mixture a day. After the beginning of October the cows were kept\r\nhoused. With such management his cows generally yielded from twelve to\r\nsixteen quarts of milk (wine measure) a day, for about eight months\r\nafter calving, when they fell off in milk, but gained in flesh, up to\r\ncalving-time. In this course of treatment the manure was far better than\r\nthe average, and his pastures constantly improved. The average amount of\r\nbutter from every sixteen quarts of milk was twenty-five ounces--a\r\nproportion far larger than the average.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"ON THE RAMPAGE.\"]\r\n\r\nHow widely does this course of treatment differ from that of most\r\nfarmers! The object with many seems to be, to see with how little food\r\nthey can keep the cow alive. From a correct point of view, the milch cow\r\nshould be regarded as an instrument of transformation. The question\r\nshould be--with so much hay, so much grain, so many roots, how can the\r\nmost milk, or butter, or cheese, be made? The conduct of a manufacturer\r\nwho owned good machinery, and an abundance of raw material, and had the\r\nlabor at hand, would be considered very senseless, if he hesitated to\r\nsupply the material, and keep the machinery at work, at least so long as\r\nhe could run it with profit.\r\n\r\nStimulate the appetite, then, and induce the cow to eat, by a frequent\r\nchange of diet, not merely enough to supply the constant waste of her\r\nsystem, but enough and to spare, of a food adapted to the production of\r\nmilk of the quality desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILING.\r\n\r\nOf the advantages of soiling milch cows--that is, feeding exclusively in\r\nthe barn--there are yet many conflicting opinions. As to its economy of\r\nland and feed there can be no question, it being generally admitted that\r\na given number of animals may be abundantly fed on a less space; nor is\r\nthere much question as to the increased quantity of milk yielded in\r\nstall feeding. Its economy, in this country, turns rather upon the cost\r\nof labor and time; and the question raised by the dairyman is, whether\r\nit will pay--whether its advantages are sufficient to balance the extra\r\nexpense of cutting and feeding, over and above cropping on the pasture.\r\nThe importance of this subject has been strongly impressed upon the\r\nattention of farmers in many sections of the country, by a growing\r\nconviction that something must be done to improve the pastures, or that\r\nthey must be abandoned altogether.\r\n\r\nThousands of acres of neglected pasture-land in the older States are so\r\npoor and worn out that from four to eight acres furnish but a miserable\r\nsubsistence for a good-sized cow. No animal can flourish under such\r\ncircumstances. The labor and exertion of feeding are too great, to say\r\nnothing of the vastly inferior quality of the grasses in such pastures,\r\ncompared with those on more recently seeded lands. True economy would\r\ndictate that such pastures should either be allowed to run to wood, or\r\nbe devoted to sheep-walks, or ploughed and improved. Cows, to be able to\r\nyield well, must have plenty of food of a sweet and nutritious quality;\r\nand, unless they find it, they wander over a large space, if at liberty,\r\nand thus deprive themselves of rest.\r\n\r\nIf a farmer or dairyman unfortunately owns such pastures, there can be\r\nno question that, as a matter of real economy, he had better resort to\r\nthe soiling system for his milch cows; by which means he will largely\r\nincrease his annual supply of good manure, and thus have the means of\r\nimproving, and bringing his land to a higher state of cultivation. A\r\nvery successful instance of this management occurs in the report of the\r\nvisiting committee of an agricultural society in Massachusetts, in which\r\nthey say: \"We have now in mind a farmer in this county who keeps seven\r\nor eight cows in the stable through the summer, and feeds them on green\r\nfodder, chiefly Indian corn. We asked him his reasons for it. His answer\r\nwas: 1. That he gets more milk than he can by any other method. 2. That\r\nhe gets more manure, especially liquid manure. 3. That he saves it all,\r\nby keeping a supply of mud or mould under the stable, to be taken out\r\nand renewed as often as necessary. 4. That it is less troublesome than\r\nto drive his cows to pasture; that they are less vexed by flies, and\r\nhave equally good health. 5. That his mowing land is every year growing\r\nmore productive, without the expense of artificial manure.--He estimates\r\nthat on an acre of good land twenty tons of green fodder may be raised.\r\nThat which is dried is cut fine, and mixed with meal or shorts, and fed\r\nwith profit. He believes that a reduced and worn-out farm--supposing the\r\nland to be naturally good--could be brought into prime order in five\r\nyears, without any extra outlay of money for manure, by the use of green\r\nfodder in connection with the raising and keeping of pigs; not\r\nfattening them, but selling at the age of four or five months.\" He\r\nkeeps most of his land in grass, improving its quality and\r\nproductiveness by means of top-dressing, and putting money in his\r\npocket--which is, after all, the true test both for theory and practice.\r\n\r\nAnother practical case on this point is that of a gentleman in the same\r\nState who had four cows, but not a rod of land on which to pasture them.\r\nThey were, therefore, never out of the barn--or, at least, not out of\r\nthe yard--and were fed with grass, regularly mown for them; with green\r\nIndian corn and fodder, which had been sown broadcast for the purpose;\r\nand with about three pints of meal a day. Their produce in butter was\r\nkept for thirteen weeks. Two of them were but two years old, having\r\ncalved the same spring. All the milk of one of them was taken by her\r\ncalf for six weeks out of the thirteen, and some of the milk of the\r\nother was taken for family use, the quantity of which was not measured.\r\nThese heifers could not, therefore, be estimated as equal to more than\r\none cow in full milk. And yet from these cows no less than three hundred\r\nand eighty-nine pounds of butter were made in the thirteen weeks.\r\nAnother pound would have made an average of thirty pounds a week for the\r\nwhole time.\r\n\r\nIt appears from these and other similar instances of soiling, or\r\nstall-feeding in summer on green crops cut for the purpose, that the\r\nlargely increased quantity of the yield fully compensates for the\r\nslightly deteriorated quality. And not only is the quantity yielded by\r\neach cow increased, but the same extent of land, under the same culture,\r\nwill carry double or treble the number of ordinary pastures, and keep\r\nthem in better condition. There is also a saving of manure. But with us\r\nthe economy of soiling is the exception, and not the rule.\r\n\r\nIn adopting this system of feeding, regularity is required as much as in\r\nany other, and a proper variety of food. A succession of green crops\r\nshould be provided, as near as convenient to the stable. The first will\r\nnaturally be winter rye, in the Northern States, as that shoots up with\r\ngreat luxuriance. Winter rape would probably be an exceedingly valuable\r\naddition to the plants usually cultivated for soiling in this country,\r\nin sections where it would withstand the severity of the winter.\r\nCabbages, kept in the cellar or pit, and transplanted early, will also\r\ncome in here to advantage, and clover will very soon follow them; oats,\r\nmillet, and green Indian-corn, as the season advances; and, a little\r\nlater still, perhaps, the Chinese sugar-cane, which should not be cut\r\ntill headed out. These plants, in addition to other cultivated grasses,\r\nwill furnish an unfailing succession of succulent and tender fodder;\r\nwhile the addition of a little Indian, linseed, or cotton-seed meal will\r\nbe found economical.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of large towns and cities, where the object is too often\r\nto feed for the largest quantity, without reference to quality, an\r\narticle known as distillers' swill, or still-slop, is extensively used.\r\nThis, if properly fed in limited quantities, in combination with other\r\nand more bulky food, may be a valuable article for the dairyman; but, if\r\ngiven--as it too often is--without the addition of other kinds of food,\r\nit soon affects the health and constitution of the animals fed on it.\r\nThis swill contains a considerable quantity of water, some nitrogenous\r\ncompounds, and some inorganic matter in the shape of phosphates and\r\nalkaline salts found in the different kinds of grain of which it is made\r\nup, as Indian corn, wheat, barley, rye, and the like. Where this forms\r\nthe principal food of milch cows, the milk is of a very poor\r\nquality--blue in color, and requiring the addition of coloring\r\nsubstances to make it saleable. It contains, often, less than one per\r\ncent. of butter, and seldom over one and three-tenths or one and a half\r\nper cent.--while good, saleable milk should contain from three to five\r\nper cent. It will not coagulate, it is said, in less than five or six\r\nhours; while good milk will invariably coagulate in an hour or less,\r\nunder the same conditions. Its effect on the system of young children\r\nis, therefore, very destructive, causing diseases of various kinds, and,\r\nif continued, death.\r\n\r\nSo pernicious have been the consequences resulting from the use of this\r\n\"swill-milk,\" as it is called, in the largest city of this country, that\r\nthe Legislature of the State of New York, at a recent session (1861-2),\r\ninterfered in behalf of the community by making the sale of the article\r\na penal offence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURE OF GRASSES FOR FODDER.\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, the grasses in summer, and hay in winter,\r\nform the most natural and important food for milch cows; and, whatever\r\nother crops come in as additional, these will form the basis of all\r\nsystems of feeding.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive qualities of the grasses differ widely; and their value as\r\nfeed for cows will depend, to a considerable extent, on the management\r\nof pastures and mowing-lands. Some considerations bearing upon the\r\nsubject of the proper cultivation of these leading articles of food\r\nare, therefore, proposed in this article.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATIENTLY WAITING.]\r\n\r\nIf the turf of an old pasture is carefully examined, it will be found to\r\ncontain a large variety of plants and grasses adapted for forage; some\r\nof them valuable for one purpose, and some for another. Some of them,\r\nthough possessing a lower percentage of nutritive constituents than\r\nothers, are particularly esteemed for an early and luxuriant growth,\r\nfurnishing sweet feed in early spring, before other grasses appear; some\r\nof them, for starting more rapidly than others, after having been eaten\r\noff by cattle, and, consequently, of great value as pasture grasses.\r\nMost grasses will be found to be of a social character, and do best in a\r\nlarge mixture with other varieties.\r\n\r\nIn forming a mixture for pasture grasses, the peculiar qualities of each\r\nspecies should, therefore, be regarded: as the time of flowering, the\r\nhabits of growth, the soil and location on which it grows best, and\r\nother characteristics.\r\n\r\nAmong the grasses found on cultivated lands in this country, the\r\nfollowing are considered as among the most valuable for ordinary farm\r\ncultivation; some of them being adapted to pastures, and others almost\r\nexclusively to mowing and the hay-crop: Timothy, Meadow Foxtail, June or\r\nKentucky Blue Grass, Fowl Meadow, Rough-stalked Meadow, Orchard Grass,\r\nPerennial Rye Grass, Italian Rye Grass, Redtop, English Bent, Meadow\r\nFescue, Tall Oat Grass, Sweet-scented Vernal, Hungarian Grass, Red\r\nClover, White or Dutch Clover, and some others.\r\n\r\nOf these, the most valuable, all things considered, is TIMOTHY. It forms\r\na large proportion of what is commonly called English, or in some\r\nsections meadow, hay, though it originated and was first cultivated in\r\nthis country. It contains a large percentage of nutritive matter, in\r\ncomparison with other agricultural grasses. It thrives best on moist,\r\npeaty, or loamy soils, of medium tenacity, and is not well suited to\r\nvery light, sandy lands. On very moist soils, its root is almost always\r\nfibrous; while on dry and loamy ones it is bulbous. On soils of the\r\nformer description, which it especially affects, its growth is rapid,\r\nand its yield of hay large, sometimes amounting to three or four tons\r\nthe acre, depending much, of course, upon cultivation. But, though very\r\nvaluable for hay, it is not adapted for pasture, as it will neither\r\nendure severe grazing, nor is its aftermath to be compared with that of\r\nmeadow foxtail, and some of the other grasses.\r\n\r\nJUNE GRASS, better known in some sections as Kentucky Blue Grass, is\r\nvery common in most sections of the country, especially on limestone\r\nlands, forming a large part of the turf, wherever it flourishes, and\r\nbeing held in universal esteem as a pasture grass. It starts early, but\r\nvaries much in size and appearance, according to the soil; growing in\r\nsome places with the utmost luxuriance, and forming the predominant\r\ngrass; in others, yielding to the other species. If cut at the time of\r\nflowering, or a few days after, it makes a good and nutritious hay,\r\nthough it is surpassed in nutritive qualities by several of the other\r\ngrasses. It starts slowly after having been cut, especially if not cut\r\nvery early. But its herbage is fine and uniform, and admirably adapted\r\nto lawns, growing well in almost all soils, though it does not endure\r\nvery severe droughts. It withstands, however, the frosts of winter\r\nbetter than most other grasses.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky--a section where it attains its highest perfection and\r\nluxuriance, ripening its seeds about the tenth of June--and in latitudes\r\nsouth of that, it sometimes continues green through the mild winters. It\r\nrequires three or four years to become well set, after sowing, and it\r\ndoes not attain its highest yield as a pasture grass till the sod is\r\neven older than that. It is not, therefore, suited to alternate\r\nhusbandry, where land usually remains in grass but two or three years\r\nbefore being ploughed up. In Kentucky, it is sown any time in winter\r\nwhen the sun is on the ground, three or four quarts of seed being used\r\nto the acre. In spring the seeds germinate, when the sprouts are\r\nexceedingly fine and delicate. Stock is not allowed on it the first\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe MEADOW FOXTAIL is also an excellent pasture grass It somewhat\r\nresembles Timothy, but is earlier, has a softer spike, and thrives on\r\nall soils except the dryest. Its growth is rapid, and it is greatly\r\nrelished by stock of all kinds. Its stalks and leaves are too few and\r\nlight for a field crop, and it shrinks too much in curing to be valuable\r\nfor hay. It flourishes best in a rich, moist, and rather strong soil,\r\nsending up a luxuriant aftermath when cut or grazed off, which is much\r\nmore valuable, both in quality and nutritive value, than the first crop.\r\nIn all lands designed for permanent pasture, therefore, it should form a\r\nconsiderable part of a mixture. It will endure almost any amount of\r\nforcing, by liquid manures or irrigation. It requires three or four\r\nyears, after soiling, to gain a firm footing in the soil. The seed is\r\ncovered with the soft and woolly husks of the flower, and is\r\nconsequently light; weighing but five pounds to the bushel, and\r\ncontaining seventy-six thousand seeds to the ounce.\r\n\r\nThe ORCHARD GRASS, or ROUGH COCKSFOOT, for pastures, stands pre-eminent.\r\nThis is a native of this country, and was introduced into England, from\r\nVirginia, in 1764, since which time its cultivation has extended into\r\nevery country of Europe, where it is universally held in very high\r\nestimation. The fact of its being very palatable to stock of all kinds,\r\nits rapid growth, and the luxuriance of its aftermath, with its power of\r\nenduring the cropping of cattle, have given it a very high reputation,\r\nespecially as a pasture grass. It blossoms earlier than Timothy; when\r\ngreen, is equally relished by milch cows; requires to be fed closer, to\r\nprevent its forming tufts and growing up to seed, when it becomes hard\r\nand wiry, and loses much of its nutritive quality. As it blossoms about\r\nthe same time, it forms an admirable mixture with red clover, either for\r\npermanent pasture or mowing. It resists drought, and is less exhausting\r\nto the soil than either rye grass or Timothy. The seed weighs twelve\r\npounds to the bushel, and when sown alone requires about two bushels to\r\nthe acre.\r\n\r\nThe ROUGH-STALKED MEADOW GRASS is somewhat less common than the June\r\ngrass, but is considered equally valuable. It grows best on moist,\r\nsheltered meadows, where it flowers in June and July. It is readily\r\ndistinguished from June grass by its having a rough sheath, while the\r\nlatter has a smooth one, and by having a fibrous root, while the root of\r\nthe other is creeping. It possesses very considerable nutritive\r\nqualities, and comes to perfection at a desirable time, and is\r\nexceedingly relished by cattle, horses and sheep. For suitable soils it\r\nshould form a portion of a mixture of seeds, producing, in mixture with\r\nother grasses which serve to shelter it, a large yield of hay, far above\r\nthe average of grass usually sown on a similar soil. It should be cut\r\nwhen the seed is formed. Seven pounds of seed to the acre will make a\r\ngood sward. The grass loses about seventy per cent. of its weight in\r\ndrying. The nutritive qualities of its aftermath exceed very\r\nconsiderably those of the crop cut in the flower or in the seed.\r\n\r\nFOWL MEADOW GRASS is another indigenous species, of great value for low\r\nand marshy grounds, where it flourishes best; and, if cut and properly\r\ncured, makes a sweet and nutritious hay, which, from its fineness, is\r\neaten by cows without waste. According to Sinclair--who experimented,\r\nwith the aid of Sir Humphrey Davy, to ascertain its comparative\r\nnutritive properties--it is superior in this respect to either meadow\r\nfoxtail, orchard grass, or tall meadow oat grass; but it is probable\r\nthat he somewhat overrates it. If allowed to stand till nearly ripe, it\r\nfalls down, but sends up innumerable flowering stems from the joints, so\r\nthat it continues green and luxuriant till late in the season. It\r\nthrives best in mixture with other grasses, and deserves a prominent\r\nplace in all mixtures for rich, moist pastures, and low mowing-lands.\r\n\r\nRYE GRASS has a far higher reputation abroad than in this country, and\r\nprobably with reason; for it is better adapted to a wet and uncertain\r\nclimate than to a dry and hot one. It varies exceedingly, depending much\r\non soil and culture; but, when cut in the blossom to make into hay, it\r\npossesses very considerable nutritive power. If allowed to get too ripe,\r\nit is hard and wiry, and not relished by cows. The change from a juicy\r\nand nutritious plant to a woody fibre, containing but little soluble\r\nmatter, is very rapid. Properly managed, however, it is a tolerably good\r\ngrass, though not to be compared to Timothy, or orchard grass.\r\n\r\nREDTOP is a grass familiar to every farmer in the country. It is the\r\nHerd's grass of Pennsylvania, while in New York and New England it is\r\nknown by a great variety of names and assumes a great variety of forms,\r\naccording to the soil in which it grows. It is well adapted to almost\r\nevery soil, though it seems to prefer a moist loam. It makes a\r\nprofitable crop for spending, in the form of hay, though its yield is\r\nless than that of Timothy. It is well suited to our permanent pastures,\r\nwhere it should be fed close, otherwise it becomes wiry and\r\ninnutritious, and cattle refuse it. It stands the climate of the country\r\nas well as any other grass, and so forms a valuable part of any mixture\r\nfor pastures and permanent mowing-lands; but it is, probably, rather\r\nover rated by us.\r\n\r\nENGLISH BENT, known also by a number of other names, is largely\r\ncultivated in some sections. It closely resembles redtop, but may be\r\ndistinguished from it by the roughness of the sheaths when the hand is\r\ndrawn from above downward. It possesses about the same qualities as\r\nredtop.\r\n\r\nMEADOW FESCUE is one of the most common of the fescue grasses, and is\r\nsaid to be the Randall grass of Virginia. It is an excellent pasture\r\ngrass, forming a very considerable portion of the turf of old pasture\r\nlands and fields; and is more extensively propagated and diffused from\r\nthe fact that it ripens its seeds before most other grasses are cut, and\r\nsheds them to spring up and cover the ground. Its long and tender leaves\r\nare much relished by cattle. It is rarely sown in this country,\r\nnotwithstanding its great and acknowledged value as a pasture grass. If\r\nsown at all, it should be in mixture with other grasses, as orchard\r\ngrass, and rye grass, or June grass. It is of much greater value at the\r\ntime of flowering than when the seed is ripe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHANCE FOR A SELECTION.]\r\n\r\nTHE TALL OAT GRASS is the Ray grass of France. It furnishes a luxuriant\r\nsupply of foliage, is valuable either for hay or for pasture, and has\r\nbeen especially recommended for soiling purposes, on account of its\r\nearly and luxuriant growth. It is often found on the borders of fields\r\nand hedges, woods and pastures, and is sometimes very plenty in\r\nmowing-lands. After having been mown it shoots up a very thick\r\naftermath, and, on this account, partly, is regarded of nearly equal\r\nexcellence with the common foxtail.\r\n\r\nIt grows spontaneously on deep, sandy soils, when once naturalized. It\r\nhas been cultivated to a considerable extent in this country, and is\r\nesteemed by those who know it mainly for its early, rapid, and late\r\ngrowth, making it very well calculated as a permanent pasture grass. It\r\nwill succeed on tenacious clover soil.\r\n\r\nThe SWEET-SCENTED VERNAL GRASS is one of the earliest in spring and one\r\nof the latest in autumn; and this habit of growth is one of its chief\r\nexcellencies, as it is neither a nutritious grass, nor very palatable to\r\nstock of any kind, nor does it yield a very good crop. It is very common\r\nin New England and all over the Middle States, coming into old worn-out\r\nfields and moist pastures spontaneously, and along every roadside. It\r\nderives its name from its sweetness of odor when partially wilted or\r\ncrushed in the hand, and it is this chiefly which gives the delicious\r\nfragrance to all new-mown bay. It is almost the only grass that\r\npossesses a strongly-marked aromatic odor, which is imparted to other\r\ngrasses with which it is cured. Its seed weighs eight pounds to the\r\nbushel. In mixtures for permanent pastures it may be of some value.\r\n\r\nHUNGARIAN GRASS, or millet, is an annual forage plant, introduced into\r\nFrance in 1815, and more recently into this country. It germinates\r\nreadily, and withstands the drought remarkably, remaining green when\r\nother grasses are parched and dried up. It has numerous succulent\r\nleaves which furnish an abundance of sweet fodder, greatly relished by\r\nstock of all kinds. It attains its greatest luxuriance on soils of\r\nmedium consistency and richness, but does very well on light and dry\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nRED CLOVER is an artificial grass of the leguminous family, and one of\r\nthe most valuable cultivated plants for feeding to dairy cows. It\r\nflourishes best on tenacious soils and stiff loams. Its growth is rapid,\r\nand a few months after sowing are sufficient to supply an abundant sweet\r\nand nutritious food. In the climate of New England, clover should be\r\nsown in the spring of the year, while most of the natural grasses do far\r\nbetter when sown in the fall. It is often sown with perfect success on\r\nthe late snows of March or April, and soon finds its way down into the\r\nsoil and takes a vigorous hold with its root. It is valuable not only as\r\na forage plant, but as shading the ground, and thereby increasing its\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of clover among the cultivated plants of the farm has\r\ndone more, perhaps, for modern agriculture than that of any other single\r\nplant. It is now considered indispensable in all good dairy districts.\r\n\r\nWHITE CLOVER, often called Honeysuckle, is also widely diffused over\r\nthis country, to which it is undoubtedly indigenous. As a mixture in all\r\npasture grasses it holds a very high rank, as it is exceedingly sweet\r\nand nutritious, and relished by all kinds of stock. It grows most\r\nluxuriantly in moist grounds and moist seasons, but easily accommodates\r\nitself to a great variety of circumstances.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the mixtures of grass-seeds most profitable for the\r\ndairy farmer, no universal rule can be given, as they depend very much\r\nupon the nature of the soil and the locality. The most important point\r\nto be observed, and the one as to which, probably, the greatest\r\ndeficiency exists, is to use a large number of species, with smaller\r\nquantities of each than those most commonly used. This is Nature's rule;\r\nfor, in examining the turf of a rich old pasture, a large number of\r\ndifferent species will be found growing together, while, if the turf of\r\na field sown without two or three species is examined, a far less number\r\nof plants is found to the square foot, even after the sod is fairly set.\r\nIn the opinion of the most competent judges, no improvement in grass\r\nculture is more important than this.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of what he would consider an improvement on the ordinary\r\nmixtures for _permanent pastures_, Mr. Flint, in his \"Milch Cows and\r\nDairy Farming,\" suggests the following as likely to give satisfactory\r\nresults, dependent, of course, to a considerable extent, on the nature\r\nand preparation of the soil:\r\n\r\nMeadow Foxtail,   flowering in May  and June,   2  pounds\r\nOrchard Grass,        \"     \"   \"        \"      6    \"\r\nSweet-scented Vernal, \"     \"  April and May,   1    \"\r\nMeadow Fescue,        \"     \"  May  and June,   2    \"\r\nRedtop,               \"     \"  June and July,   2    \"\r\nJune Grass,           \"     \"  May  and June,   4    \"\r\nItalian Rye Grass,    \"     \"  June,            4    \"\r\nPerennial do.,        \"     \"   \"        \"      6    \"\r\nTimothy,              \"     \"  June and July,   3    \"\r\nRough-stalked Meadow Grass,     \"        \"      2    \"\r\nPerennial Clover, flowering in June,            3    \"\r\nWhite Clover,         \"     \"  May to September 5-40 \"\r\n\r\nFor mowing-lands the mixture would, of course, be somewhat changed. The\r\nmeadow foxtail and sweet-scented vernal would be left out entirely, and\r\nsome six or eight pounds added to the Timothy and red clover. The proper\r\ntime to lay down lands to grass in the latitude of New England is August\r\nor September, and no grain crop should be sown with the seed.\r\n\r\nStiff or clayey pastures should never be overstocked, but when fed\r\npretty close the grasses are far sweeter and more nutritious than when\r\nthey are allowed to grow up rank and coarse; and if, by a want of\r\nsufficient feeding, they get the start of the stock, and grow into rank\r\ntufts, they should be cut and removed, when a fresh grass will start up,\r\nsimilar to the aftermath of mowing-lands, which will be eaten with\r\navidity. Grasses for curing into hay should be cut either at the time of\r\nflowering, or just before, especially if designed for milch cows. They\r\nare then more succulent and juicy, and, if properly cured, form the\r\nsweetest food.\r\n\r\nGrass cut in the blossom will make more milk than if allowed to stand\r\nlater. Cut a little before the blossoming; it will make more than when\r\nin blossom, and the cows prefer it, which is by no means an unimportant\r\nconsideration, since their tastes should always be consulted. Grass cut\r\nsomewhat green, and properly cured, is next to fresh, green grass in\r\npalatable, nutritive qualities. Every farmer knows the milk-producing\r\nproperties of rowen, or second crop, which is generally cut before it\r\nripens.\r\n\r\nNo operation on the farm is of greater importance to the dairyman than\r\nthe cutting of his grass and the manner of curing hay; and in this\r\nrespect the practice over the country generally is susceptible of very\r\nmarked improvement. The chief object is to preserve the sweetness and\r\nsucculence of the grass in its natural state, so far as possible; and\r\nthis object cannot be attained by exposing it too long to the scorching\r\nsuns and drenching rains to which our climate is liable. As a general\r\nthing, farmers try to make their hay too much.\r\n\r\nAs to the best modes of curing clover, the following, among others, is\r\nadopted by many successful farmers: What is mown in the morning is left\r\nin the swath, to be turned over early in the afternoon. At about four\r\no'clock, or while it is still warm, it is put into small cocks with a\r\nfork, and, if the weather is favorable, it may be housed on the fourth\r\nor fifth day, the cocks being turned over on the morning of the day in\r\nwhich it is to be carted. By this method all the heads and leaves are\r\nsaved, and these are more valuable than the stems. For new milch cows in\r\nwinter scarcely any food is better. It will cause them to give as great\r\na flow of milk as any hay, unless it be good rowen.\r\n\r\nINDIAN CORN makes an exceedingly valuable fodder, both as a means of\r\ncarrying a herd of milch cows through our severe droughts of summer, and\r\nas an article for soiling cows kept in the stall. No dairy farmer will\r\nneglect to sow an extent in proportion to the number of cows which he\r\nkeeps. The most common practice is, to sow in drills from two and a half\r\nto three feet apart, on land well tilled and thoroughly manured, making\r\nthe drills from six to ten inches wide with the plough, manuring in the\r\nfurrow, dropping the kernels about two inches apart, and covering with\r\nthe hoe. In this mode of culture, the cultivator may be used between\r\nthe rows when the corn is from six to twelve inches high, and, unless\r\nthe ground is very weedy, no other after culture is needed. The first\r\nsowing usually takes place about the middle of May, and this is\r\nsucceeded by other sowings, at intervals of a week or ten days, till\r\nJuly, in order to have a succession of green fodder; but, if it is\r\ndesigned to cut it up to cure for winter use, an early sowing is\r\ngenerally preferred, in order to be able to cure it in warm weather, in\r\nAugust or early in September. Sown in this way, about three or four\r\nbushels of corn are required for an acre; since, if sown thickly, the\r\nfodder is better, the stalks smaller, and the waste less.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty in curing corn cultivated for this purpose, and\r\nafter the methods just spoken of, arises from the fact that it comes at\r\na season when the weather is often colder, the days shorter, and the\r\ndews heavier, than when the curing of hay takes place. Nor is the curing\r\nof corn cut up green so easy and simple as that of the drying of stalks\r\nof Indian corn cut above the ear, as in the common practice of topping.\r\nThe plant is then riper, less juicy, and cures more readily.\r\n\r\nThe method sometimes adopted is to cut and tie into small bundles, after\r\nit is somewhat wilted, and then to stook upon the ground, where it is\r\nallowed to stand, subject to all the changes of weather, with only the\r\nprotection of the stook itself. The stooks consist of bunches of stalks\r\nfirst bound into small bundles, and are made sufficiently large to\r\nprevent the wind from blowing them over. The arms are thrown around the\r\ntops to bring them as closely together as possible, when the tops are\r\nbroken over or twisted together, or otherwise fastened, in order to\r\nmake the stook \"shed the rain\" as well as possible. In this condition\r\nthey remain out until they are sufficiently dried to be put in the barn.\r\nCorn fodder is very excellent for young dairy stock.\r\n\r\nCOMMON MILLET is another very valuable crop for fodder in soiling, or to\r\ncure for winter use, but especially to feed out during the usual season\r\nof drought. Many varieties of millet are cultivated in this country, the\r\nground being prepared and treated as for oats. If designed to cut for\r\ngreen fodder, half a bushel of seed to the acre should be used; if to\r\nripen seed, twelve quarts, sown broadcast, about the last of May or\r\nearly in June. A moist loam or muck is the best soil adapted to millet;\r\nbut very great crops have been grown on dry upland. It is very palatable\r\nand nutritious for milch cows, both green and when properly cured. The\r\ncuring should be very much like that of clover, care being taken not to\r\nover-dry it. For fodder, either green or cured, it is cut before\r\nripening. In this state all cattle eat it as readily as green corn, and\r\na less extent will feed them. Millet is worthy of a widely-extended\r\ncultivation, particularly on dairy farms. Indian millet is another\r\ncultivated variety.\r\n\r\nRYE, as a fodder plant, is chiefly valuable for its early growth in\r\nspring. It is usually sown in September or October--from the middle to\r\nthe end of September being, perhaps, the most desirable time--on land\r\npreviously cultivated and in good condition. If designed to ripen only,\r\na bushel of seed is required to the acre, evenly sown; but, if intended\r\nfor early fodder in spring, two or two and a half bushels of seed per\r\nacre should be used. On warm land the rye can be cut green the last of\r\nApril or the first of May. Care should be taken to cut early; since, if\r\nit is allowed to advance too far towards maturity, the stalk becomes\r\nhard and unpalatable to cows.\r\n\r\nOATS are also sometimes used for soiling, or for feeding green, to eke\r\nout a scanty supply of pasture feed; and for this purpose they are\r\nvaluable. They should be sown on well-tilled and well-manured land,\r\nabout four bushels to the acre, towards the last of April or the first\r\nof May. If the whole crop is to be used as green fodder, five bushels of\r\nseed will not be too much for good, strong soil. They will be\r\nsufficiently grown to cut by the first of July, or in some sections\r\nearlier, depending upon the location.\r\n\r\nThe CHINESE SUGAR-CANE also may deserve attention as a fodder plant.\r\nExperiments thus far made would seem to show that when properly\r\ncultivated, and cut at the right time, it is a palatable and nutritious\r\nplant, while many of the failures have been the result of too early\r\ncutting. For a fodder crop the drill culture is preferable, both on\r\naccount of the larger yield obtained and because it is thus prevented\r\nfrom becoming too hard and stalky.\r\n\r\nOf the root crops the POTATO is the first to be mentioned. This produces\r\na large quantity of milk, though the quality is inferior. The market\r\nvalue of this root is, at times, too great to allow of feeding\r\nextensively with it, even in milk dairies, where it is most valuable as\r\na food for cows; still, there are locations where it may be judicious to\r\ncultivate this root for dairy feed, and in all circumstances there is a\r\ncertain portion of the crop of unmarketable size, which will be of value\r\nfed to milch cows or swine. It should be planted in April or May, but in\r\nmany sections in June, on good mellow soil, first thoroughly plowed and\r\nharrowed, then furrowed three feet apart, and manured in the furrows\r\nwith a mixture of ashes, plaster of Paris, and salt. The seed may be\r\ndropped in the furrows, one foot apart, after the drill system--or in\r\nhills, two and a half or three feet apart--to be covered with the plough\r\nby simply turning the furrows back, after which the whole should be\r\nrolled with the field-roller, when it can be done.\r\n\r\nIf the land is not already in good heart from continued cultivation, a\r\nfew loads of barnyard manure may be spread, and plowed under, by the\r\nfirst plowing. Used in this way it is far less liable to cause the rot,\r\nthan when it is put in the hill. If a sufficient quantity of wood-ashes\r\nis not at hand, sifted coal-ashes will answer the purpose, and these are\r\nsaid to be valuable as a preventive of rot. In this way, one man, two\r\nboys, and a horse can plant from three to four acres a day on mellow\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBy another method two acres a day on the sod have been planted. The\r\nmanure is first spread upon the grass, and then a furrow made by a yoke\r\nof oxen and one man, another following after and dropping, a foot apart,\r\nalong the outer edge of the furrow on the grass. By quick work, one hand\r\ncan nearly keep up with the plow in dropping. When arrived at the end of\r\nthe piece, a back furrow is turned up to the potatoes, and a good\r\nplowman will cover nearly all without difficulty. On the return furrow,\r\nthe man or boy who dropped follows after, covering up any that may be\r\nleft or displaced, and smoothing off the top of the back-furrows when\r\nnecessary. Potatoes thus planted have come out finely.\r\n\r\nThe cost of cultivation in this mode, it must be evident, is but\r\ntrifling, compared with the slower method of hand-planting. It requires\r\na skillful ploughman, a quick, active lad, and a good yoke of oxen, and\r\nthe extent of the work will depend somewhat upon the state of the turf.\r\nThe nutritive equivalent for potatoes in a hundred pounds of good hay is\r\n319 pounds; that is, it will take 3.19 pounds of potatoes to afford the\r\nsame amount of nourishment as one pound of hay. The great value of roots\r\nis as a change or condiment calculated to keep the animal in a healthy\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WEST HIGHLAND OX.]\r\n\r\nThe CARROT is somewhat extensively fed, and is a valuable root for milch\r\ncows. This, like the potato, has been cultivated and improved from a\r\nwild plant. Carrots require a deep, warm, mellow soil, thoroughly\r\ncultivated, but clean, and free from weed-seed. The difference between a\r\nvery good profit and a loss on the crop depends much upon the use of\r\nland and manures perfectly free from foul seeds of any kind. Ashes,\r\nguano, seaweed, ground bones, and other similar substances, or\r\nthoroughly-rotted and fermented compost, will answer the purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter plowing deep, and harrowing carefully, the seed should be planted\r\nwith a seed-sower, in drills about eighteen inches apart, at the rate of\r\nfour pounds to the acre, about the middle of May. The difference\r\nbetween sowing on the fifteenth of May and on the tenth of June in New\r\nEngland is said to be nearly one-third in the crop on an average of\r\nyears. In weeding, a little wheel hoe is invaluable, as with it a large\r\npart of the labor of cultivation is saved. A skillful hand can run this\r\nhoe within a half an inch of the young plants without injury, and go\r\nover a large space in the course of a day, if the land was properly\r\nprepared in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe American farmer should always plan to economize labor, which is the\r\ngreat item of expense upon a farm. By this is not meant that he should\r\nstrive to shirk or avoid work, but that he should make the least amount\r\nof work accomplish the greatest and most profitable results.\r\nLabor-saving machinery on the farm is applied, not to reduce the number\r\nof hours of labor, or to make the owner a man of leisure--who is,\r\ngenerally, the unhappiest man in the world--but to enable him to\r\naccomplish the greatest results in the same time that he would be\r\ncompelled to obtain smaller ones.\r\n\r\nCarrots will continue to grow and increase in size late into the fall.\r\nWhen ready to dig, plow around as near to the outside rows as possible,\r\nturning away the furrow from the row. Then take out the carrots, pulling\r\noff the tops, and throw the carrots and tops into separate heaps on the\r\nplowed furrows. In this way a man and two boys can harvest and put into\r\nthe cellar upwards of a hundred bushels a day.\r\n\r\nThe TURNIP, and the Swedish turnip, or ruta baga, are also largely\r\ncultivated as a field crop to feed to stock; and for this purpose almost\r\nnumberless varieties are used, furnishing a great amount of succulent\r\nand nutritious food, late into winter, and, if well-kept, late into\r\nspring. The chief objection to the turnip is, that it taints the milk.\r\nThis may be remedied--to a considerable extent, if not wholly--by the\r\nuse of salt, or salt hay, and by feeding at the time of milking, or\r\nimmediately after, or by steaming before feeding, or putting a small\r\nquantity of the solution of nitre into the pail, and milking upon it.\r\n\r\nTurnips may be sown any time in June, in rich land, well mellowed by\r\ncultivation. Very large crops are obtained, sown as late as the middle\r\nof July, or the first of August, on an inverted sod. The Michigan, or\r\ndouble-mould-board plow leaves the land light, and in admirable\r\ncondition to harrow, and drill in turnips. In one instance, a successful\r\nroot-grower cut two tons of hay to the acre, on the twenty-third of\r\nJune, and after it was removed from the land spread eight cords of\r\nrotten kelp to the acre, and plowed in; after which about three cords of\r\nfine old compost manure were used to the acre, which was sown with ruta\r\nbaga seed, in drills, three feet apart, plants thinned to eight or ten\r\ninches in the drill. No after cultivation was required. On the fifteenth\r\nof November he harvested three hundred and seventy bushels of splendid\r\nroots to the acre, carefully measured off.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive equivalent of Swedish turnips as compared with good meadow\r\nhay is 676, taking hay as a standard at 100; that is, it would require\r\n6.76 pounds of turnips to furnish the same nutriment as one pound of\r\ngood hay; but fed in connection with other food--as hay, for\r\nexample--perhaps five pounds of turnips would be about equal to one\r\npound of hay.\r\n\r\nThe English or round turnip is usually sown broadcast after some other\r\ncrop, and large and valuable returns are often obtained. The Swede is\r\nsown in drills. Both of these varieties are used for the production of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to the turnip crop is that it leaves many kinds of\r\nsoil unfit for a succession of some other crops, like Indian corn, for\r\ninstance. In some sections, no amount of manuring appears to make corn\r\ndo well after turnips or ruta bagas.\r\n\r\nThe MANGOLD WURTZEL, a variety of the common beet, is often cultivated\r\nin this country with great success, and fed to cows with advantage,\r\nfurnishing a succulent and nutritive food in winter and spring. The crop\r\nis somewhat uncertain. When it does well, an enormous yield is often\r\nobtained; but, not rarely, it proves a failure, and is not, on the\r\nwhole, quite as reliable as the ruta baga, though a more valuable crop\r\nwhen the yield is good. It is cultivated like the common beet in moist,\r\nrich soils; three pounds of seed to the acre The leaves may be stripped\r\noff, towards fall, and fed out, without injury to the growth of the\r\nroot. Both mangolds and turnips should be cut with a root-cutter, before\r\nbeing fed out.\r\n\r\nThe PARSNIP is a very sweet and nutritious article of fodder, and adds\r\nrichness and flavor to the milk. It is worthy of extended culture in all\r\nparts of the country where dairy husbandry is pursued. It is a biennial,\r\neasily raised on deep, rich, well-cultivated and well-manured soils,\r\noften yielding enormous crops, and possessing the decided advantage of\r\nwithstanding the severest winters. As an article of spring feeding,\r\ntherefore, it is exceedingly valuable. Sown in April or May, it attains\r\na large growth before winter. Then, if desirable, a part of the crop may\r\nbe harvested for winter use, and the remainder left in the ground till\r\nthe frost is out, in March or April, when they can be dug as wanted, and\r\nare exceedingly relished by milch cows and stock of all kinds. They make\r\nan admirable feed at the time of milking, and produce the richest cream,\r\nand the yellowest and finest-flavored butter, of any roots used among\r\nus. The best dairy farmers on the Island of Jersey often feed to their\r\ncows from thirty to thirty-five pounds of parsnips a day, in addition to\r\nhay or grass.\r\n\r\nBoth practical experiment and scientific analysis prove this root to be\r\neminently adapted to dairy stock, where the richness of milk or\r\nfine-flavored butter is any object. For mere milk-dairies, it is not\r\nquite so valuable, probably, as the Swedish turnip. The culture is\r\nsimilar to that of carrots, a rich, mellow, and deep loam being best;\r\nwhile it has a great advantage over the carrot in being more hardy, and\r\nrather less liable to injury from insects, and more nutritive. For\r\nfeeding and fattening stock it is eminently adapted.\r\n\r\nTo be sure of a crop, fresh seed must be had, as it cannot be depended\r\non for more than one year. For this reason the largest and straightest\r\nroots should be allowed to stand for seed, which, as soon as nearly\r\nripe, should be taken out and spread out to dry, and carefully kept for\r\nuse. For field culture, the hollow-crowned parsnip is the best and most\r\nprofitable; but on thin, shallow soils the turnip-rooted variety should\r\nbe used. Parsnips may be harvested like carrots, by plowing along the\r\nrows. Let butter or cheese dairymen give this crop a fair and full\r\ntrial, and watch its effect in the quality of the milk and butter.\r\n\r\nThe KOHL RABI is also cultivated to a considerable extent in this\r\ncountry for the purpose of feeding stock. It is supposed to be a hybrid\r\nbetween the cabbage and the turnip and is often called the\r\ncabbage-turnip, having the root of the former, with a turnip-like or\r\nbulbous stem. The special reason for its more extensive cultivation\r\namong us is its wonderful indifference to droughts, in which it seems to\r\nflourish best, and to bring forth the most luxuriant crops. It also\r\nwithstands the frosts remarkably, being a hardy plant. It yields a\r\nsomewhat richer quality of milk than the ordinary turnip, and the crop\r\nis generally admitted to be as abundant and profitable. Very large crops\r\nof it have been produced by the ordinary turnip or cabbage cultivation.\r\nAs in cabbage-culture, it is best to sow the seed in March or April, in\r\na warm and well-enriched seed-bed; from which it is transplanted in May,\r\nand set out after the manner of cabbages in garden culture. It bears\r\ntransplanting better than most other roots. Insects injure it less than\r\nthe turnip, dry weather favors it, and it keeps well through winter. For\r\nthese reasons, it must be regarded as a valuable addition to our list of\r\nforage plants adapted to dairy farming. It grows well on stronger soils\r\nthan the turnip requires.\r\n\r\nLINSEED MEAL is the ground cake of flaxseed after the oil is pressed\r\nout. It is very rich in fat-forming principles, and given to milch cows\r\nincreases the quality of butter, and keeps them in condition. Four or\r\nfive pounds a day are sufficient for cows in milk, and this amount will\r\neffect a great saving in the cost of other food, and at the same time\r\nmake a very rich milk. It is extensively manufactured in this country,\r\nand largely exported, but it is worthy of more general use here. It must\r\nnot be fed in too large quantities to milch cows, for it would be liable\r\nto give too great a tendency to fat, and thus affect the quantity of the\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nCOTTON-SEED MEAL is an article of comparatively recent introduction. It\r\nis obtained by pressing the seed of the cotton-plant, which extracts the\r\noil, when the cake is crushed or ground into meal, which has been found\r\nto be a very valuable article for feeding stock. From analysis it is\r\nshown to be equal or superior to linseed meal. Practical experiments\r\nonly are needed to establish it. It can be procured in market at a\r\nreasonable price.\r\n\r\nThe MANURES used in this country for the culture of the above named\r\nplants are mostly such as are made on the farm, consisting chiefly of\r\nbarnyard composts of various kinds, with often a large admixture of\r\npeat-mud. There are few farms that do not contain substances, which, if\r\nproperly husbanded, would add very greatly to the amount of manure\r\nordinarily made. The best of the concentrated manures, which it is\r\nsometimes necessary to use, for want of time and labor to prepare enough\r\nupon the farm, is, unquestionably, Peruvian guano. The results of this,\r\nwhen properly applied, are well known and reliable, which can hardly be\r\nsaid of any other artificial manure offered for the farmer's notice. The\r\nchief objection to depending upon manures made off the farm is, in the\r\nfirst place, their great expense; and in the second--which is equally\r\nimportant--the fact, that, though they may be made valuable, and produce\r\nat one time the best results, a want of care in the manufacture, or\r\ndesigned fraud, may make them almost worthless, with the impossibility\r\nof detecting the imposition, without a chemical analysis, till it\r\nbecomes too late, and the crop is lost.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, safest to rely mainly upon the home manufacture of\r\nmanure. The extra expense of soiling cattle, saving and applying the\r\nliquid manure, and thus bringing the land to a higher state of\r\ncultivation, when it will be capable of keeping more stock and\r\nfurnishing more manure, would offer a surer road to success than a\r\nconstant outlay for concentrated fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARN.\r\n\r\nThe farm barn, next to the farm house, is the most important structure\r\nof the farm itself, in the Northern and Middle States; and even at the\r\nSouth and Southwest, where barns are less used, they are of more\r\nimportance in the economy of farm management than is generally\r\nunderstood. Indeed, to the eyes of a person of taste, a farm or\r\nplantation appears incomplete, without good barn accommodations, as much\r\nas without good household appointments--and without them, no\r\nagricultural establishment can be complete in all its proper economy.\r\n\r\nThe most _thorough_ barn structures, perhaps, to be seen in the United\r\nStates, are those of the State of Pennsylvania, built by the German\r\nfarmers of the lower and central counties. They are large, and expensive\r\nin their construction; and, in a strictly economical point of view, are,\r\nperhaps, more costly than is required. Yet, there is a substantial\r\ndurability about them, that is exceedingly satisfactory, and, where the\r\npecuniary ability of the farmer will admit, they may well furnish models\r\nfor imitation.\r\n\r\nIn the structure of the barn, and in its interior accommodation, much\r\nwill depend upon the branches of agriculture to which the farm is\r\ndevoted. A farm cultivated in grain chiefly requires but little room for\r\nstabling purposes. Storage for grain in the sheaf, and granaries, will\r\nrequire its room; while a stock farm requires a barn with extensive hay\r\nstorage, and stables for its cattle, horses, and sheep, in all climates\r\nwhich do not admit of such stocks living through the winter in the\r\nfield, as is the case in the great grazing districts west of the\r\nAlleghanies. Again, there are wide districts of country where a mixed\r\nhusbandry of grain and stock is pursued, which require barns and\r\noutbuildings accommodating both.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to remark that many designers of barns, sheds, and\r\nother outbuildings for the accommodation of farm stock, have indulged in\r\nfanciful arrangements for the comfort and convenience of animals, which\r\nare so complicated that when constructed, as they sometimes are, the\r\npractical, common-sense farmer will not use them; and by reason of the\r\nlearning which is required for their use, they are altogether unsuitable\r\nfor the treatment and use which they generally receive from those who\r\nhave the daily care of the stock for which they are intended, and for\r\nthe rough usage which they experience from the animals themselves. A\r\nvery pretty and plausible arrangement of stabling, feeding, and all the\r\nother requirements of a barn establishment may be thus got up by an\r\ningenious theorist at the fireside, which will work charmingly as he\r\ndilates upon its good qualities, untried; but, which, when subjected to\r\nexperiment, will be utterly worthless for practical use. There can be\r\nno doubt that the simplest plan of construction, consistent with an\r\neconomical expenditure of the material of food for the consumption of\r\nstock, is by far the most preferable.\r\n\r\nAnother item to be considered in this connection, is the comparative\r\nvalue of the stock, the forage fed to them, and the labor expended in\r\nfeeding and taking care of them. To illustrate: Suppose a farm to lie in\r\nthe vicinity of a large town or city. Its value is, perhaps, a hundred\r\ndollars an acre. The hay cut upon it is worth fifteen dollars a ton, at\r\nthe barn, and straw and coarse grains in proportion, and hired labor ten\r\nor twelve dollars a month. Consequently, the manager of this farm should\r\nuse all the economy in his power, by the aid of cutting-boxes and other\r\nmachinery, to make the least amount of forage supply the wants of his\r\nstock; and the internal economy of his barn should be arranged\r\naccordingly, since labor is his cheapest item, and food his dearest.\r\nTherefore, any contrivance by which to work up his forage the\r\nclosest--by way of machinery, or manual labor--so that it shall serve\r\nthe purposes of keeping his stock, is true economy; and the making and\r\nsaving of manures are items of the first importance. His buildings and\r\ntheir arrangements throughout should, for these reasons, be constructed\r\nin accordance with his practice.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, lands are cheap and productive, and labor\r\ncomparatively dear, a different practice will prevail. The farmer will\r\nfeed his hay from the mow without cutting. The straw will be stacked\r\nout, and the cattle turned to it, to pick what they like of it, and make\r\ntheir beds of the remainder; or, if it is housed, he will throw it into\r\nracks, and the stock may eat what they choose. To do this requires but\r\none-third, or one-half of the labor which is required by the other mode,\r\nand the saving in this makes up, and perhaps more than makes up, for the\r\nincreased quantity of forage consumed.\r\n\r\nAgain, climate may equally affect the mode of winter-feeding the stock.\r\nThe winters may be mild. The hay may be stacked in the fields when\r\ngathered, or put into small barns built for hay storage alone; and the\r\nmanure, scattered over the fields by the cattle, as they are fed from\r\neither of them, may be knocked to pieces with the dung-beetle, in the\r\nspring, or harrowed and bushed over the ground; and with the very small\r\nquantity of labor required in all this, such practice will be more\r\neconomical than any other which can be adopted.\r\n\r\nIn latitudes, however, in which it becomes necessary to stall-feed\r\nduring several months of the year, barns are indispensable. These should\r\nbe warm, and at the same time well ventilated. The barn should be\r\narranged in a manner suitable to keeping hay and other fodder dry and\r\nsweet, and with reference to the comfort and health of the animals, and\r\nthe economy of labor and manure. The size and finish will, of course,\r\ndepend on the wants and means of the farmer or dairyman; but many little\r\nconveniences, it should not be forgotten, can be added at comparatively\r\ntrifling cost.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cut of a barn is given merely as an illustration of a\r\nconvenient arrangement for a medium-sized dairy, and not as being\r\nadapted to all circumstances or situations. This barn is supposed to\r\nstand upon a side-hill or an inclined surface, where it is easy to have\r\na cellar, if desired; and the cattle-room, as shown in the cut, is in\r\nthe second story, or directly over the cellar, the bottom of which\r\nshould be somewhat dished, or lower in the middle than around the outer\r\nsides, and carefully paved, or laid in cement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARN FOR THIRTY-FOUR COWS AND THREE YOKE OF OXEN.]\r\n\r\nOn the outside is represented an open shed, _m_, for carts and wagons to\r\nremain under cover, thirty feet by fifteen, while _l l l l l l_ are bins\r\nfor vegetables, to be filled through scuttles from the floor of the\r\nstory above, and surrounded by solid walls. The area of this whole floor\r\nequals one hundred feet by fifty-seven. _k_, is an open space, nearly on\r\na level with the cow-chamber, through the door _p_. _s_, stairs to the\r\nthird story and to the cellar, _d d d_, passage next to the walls, five\r\nfeet wide, and nine inches above the dung-pit. _e e e_, dung-pit, two\r\nfeet wide, and seven inches below the floor where the cattle stand. The\r\nmanure drops from this pit into the cellar below, five feet from the\r\nwalls, and quite around the cellar. _c c c_, plank floor for cows, four\r\nfeet six inches long. _b b b_, stalls for three yoke of oxen, on a\r\nplatform five feet six inches long, _n n_, calf-pens, which may also be\r\nused for cows in calving. _r r_, feeding-troughs for calves.

This cistern is\r\nregulated by a cock and ball, and the water flows by dotted lines,\r\n_o o o_, to the boxes; each box being connected by lead pipes well secured\r\nfrom frost, so that, if desired, each animal can be watered without\r\nleaving the stall, or water can be kept constantly before it.

The cows all face toward the open area in the centre.\r\n\r\nThis cow-room may be furnished with a thermometer, clock, etc., and\r\nshould always be well ventilated by sliding windows, which at the same\r\ntime admit the light.\r\n\r\nThe next cut is a transverse section of the same cow-room; _a_ being a\r\nwalk behind the cows, five feet wide; _b_, dung-pit; _c_, cattle-stand;\r\n_d_, feeding-trough, with a bottom on a level with the platform where\r\nthe cattle stand; _k_, open area, forty-three feet, by fifty-six.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSVERSE SECTION.]\r\n\r\nThe story above the cow-room--as represented in the next cut--is one\r\nhundred feet by forty-two; the bays for hay, ten on each side, being ten\r\nfeet front and fifteen feet deep; and the open space, _p_, for the\r\nentrance of wagons, carts, etc., twelve feet wide. _b_, hay-scales. _c_,\r\nscale beam. _m m m m m m_, ladders reaching almost to the roof. _l l l_,\r\netc., scuttle-holes for sending vegetables directly to the bins, _l l l_,\r\netc., below. _a a b b_, rooms on the corners for storage. _d_,\r\nscuttles; four of which are used for straw, one for cut hay, and one for\r\nmuck for the cellar. _n_ and the other small squares are eighteen-feet\r\nposts. _f_, passage to the tool-house, a room one hundred feet long by\r\neighteen wide. _o_, stairs leading to the scaffold in the roof of the\r\ntool-house. _i i_, benches. _g_, floor. _h_, boxes for hoes, shovels,\r\nspades, picks, iron bars, old iron, etc. _j j j_, bins for fruit. _k_,\r\nscuttles to put apples into wagons, etc., in the shed below. One side of\r\nthis tool-house may be used for plows and large implements, hay-rigging,\r\nharness, etc.\r\n\r\nProper ventilation of the cellar and the cow-room avoids the objection\r\nthat the hay is liable to injury from noxious gases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROOM OVER THE COW-ROOM.]\r\n\r\nThe excellent manure-cellar beneath this barn extends only under the\r\ncow-room. It has a drive-way through doors on each side. No barn-cellar\r\nshould be kept shut up tight, even in cold weather. The gases are\r\nconstantly escaping from the manure, unless held by absorbents, which\r\nare liable not only to affect the health of the stock, but also to\r\ninjure the quality of the hay. To prevent this, while securing the\r\nimportant advantages of a manure-cellar, the barn may be furnished with\r\ngood-sized ventilators on the top, for every twenty-five feet of its\r\nlength, and with wooden tubes leading from the cellar to the top.\r\n\r\nThere should also be windows on different sides of the cellar to admit\r\nthe free circulation of air. With these precautions, together with the\r\nuse of absorbents in the shape of loam and muck, there will be no danger\r\nof rotting the timbers of the barn, or of risking the health of the\r\ncattle or the quality of the hay.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which the cow-room should be kept is somewhere from\r\nfifty to sixty degrees, Fahrenheit. The practice and the opinions of\r\nsuccessful dairymen differ somewhat on this point. Too great heat would\r\naffect the health and appetite of the herd; while too low a temperature\r\nis equally objectionable, for various reasons.\r\n\r\nThe most economical plan for room in tying cattle in their stalls, is to\r\nfasten the rope or chain, whichever is used--the wooden stanchion, or\r\nstanchel, as it is called, to open and shut, enclosing the animal by the\r\nneck, being objectionable--into a ring, which is secured by a strong\r\nstaple into a post. This prevents the cattle from interfering with each\r\nother, while a partition effectually prevents any contact from the\r\nanimals on each side of it, in the separate stalls.\r\n\r\nThere is no greater benefit for cattle, after coming into\r\nwinter-quarters, than a systematic regularity in every thing pertaining\r\nto them. Every animal should have its own particular stall in the\r\nstable, where it should always be kept. The cattle should be fed and\r\nwatered at certain fixed hours of the day, as near as may be. If let out\r\nof the stables for water, unless the weather is very pleasant--when they\r\nmay be permitted to lie out for a short time--they should be immediately\r\nput back, and not allowed to range about with the outside cattle. They\r\nare more quiet and contented in their stables than elsewhere, and waste\r\nless food than if permitted to run out; besides being in every way more\r\ncomfortable, if properly bedded and attended to, as every one will find\r\nupon trial. The habit which many farmers have, of turning their cattle\r\nout of the stables in the morning, in all weathers--letting them range\r\nabout in a cold yard, hooking and annoying each other--is of no possible\r\nbenefit, unless it be to rid them of the trouble of cleaning the\r\nstables, which pays more than twice its cost in the saving of manure.\r\nThe outside cattle, which occupy the yard--if there are any--are all the\r\nbetter that the stabled ones do not interfere with them. They become\r\nhabituated to their own quarters, as do the others, and all are better\r\nfor being, respectively, in their proper places.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILKING.\r\n\r\nThe manner of milking exerts a more powerful and lasting influence on\r\nthe productiveness of the cow than most farmers are aware. That a slow\r\nand careless milker soon dries up the best of cows, every practical\r\nfarmer and dairyman knows; but a careful examination of the beautiful\r\nstructure of the udder will serve further to explain the proper mode of\r\nmilking, in order to obtain and keep up the largest yield.\r\n\r\nThe udder of a cow consists of four glands, disconnected from each\r\nother, but all contained within one bag or cellular membrane; and these\r\nglands are uniform in structure. Each gland consists of three parts: the\r\n_glandular_, or secreting part, _tubular_ or conducting part, and the\r\n_teats_, or receptacle, or receiving part. The glandular forms by far\r\nthe largest portion of the udder. It appears to the naked eye composed\r\nof a mass of yellowish grains; but under the microscope these grains are\r\nfound to consist entirely of minute blood-vessels forming a compact\r\nplexus, or fold. These vessels secrete the milk from the blood. The milk\r\nis abstracted from the blood in the glandular part; the tubes receive\r\nand deposit it in the reservoir, or receptacle; and the sphincter at the\r\nend of the teat retains it there until it is wanted for use.\r\n\r\nThis must not be understood, however, as asserting that all the milk\r\ndrawn from the udder at one milking is contained in the receptacle. The\r\nmilk, as it is secreted, is conveyed to the receptacle, and when that is\r\nfull, the larger tubes begin to be filled, and next the smaller ones,\r\nuntil the whole become gorged. When this takes place, the secretion of\r\nthe milk ceases, and absorption of the thinner or more watery part\r\ncommences. Now, as this absorption takes place more readily in the\r\nsmaller or more distant tubes, it is invariably found that the milk from\r\nthese, which comes last into the receptacle, is much thicker and richer\r\nthan what was first drawn off. This milk has been significantly styled\r\nafterings, or strippings; and should this gorged state of the tubes be\r\npermitted to continue beyond a certain time, serious mischief will\r\nsometimes occur; the milk becomes too thick to flow through the tubes,\r\nand soon produces, first irritation, then inflammation, and lastly\r\nsuppuration, and the function of the gland is materially impaired or\r\naltogether destroyed. Hence the great importance of emptying these\r\nsmaller tubes regularly and thoroughly, not merely to prevent the\r\noccurrence of disease, but actually to increase the quantity of milk;\r\nfor, so long as the smaller tubes are kept free, milk is constantly\r\nforming; but whenever, as has already been mentioned, they become\r\ngorged, the secretion of milk ceases until they are emptied. The cow\r\nherself has no power over the sphincter at the end of her teat, so as to\r\nopen it, and relieve the overcharged udder; neither has she any power of\r\nretaining the milk collected in the reservoirs when the spasm of the\r\nsphincter is overcome.\r\n\r\nThus is seen the necessity of drawing away the last drop of milk at\r\nevery milking; and the better milker the cow, the more necessary this\r\nis. What has been said demonstrates, also, the impropriety of holding\r\nthe milk in cows until the udder is distended much beyond its ordinary\r\nsize, for the sake of showing its capacity for holding milk--a device to\r\nwhich many dealers in cows resort.\r\n\r\nThus much of the internal structure of the udder. Its external form\r\nrequires attention, because it indicates different properties. Its form\r\nshould be spheroidal, large, giving an idea of capaciousness; the bag\r\nshould have a soft, fine skin, and the hind part upward toward the tail\r\nbe loose and elastic. There should be fine, long hairs scattered\r\nplentifully over the surface, to keep it warm. The teats should not seem\r\nto be contracted, or funnel-shaped, at the inset with the bag. In the\r\nformer state, teats are very apt to become corded, or spindled; and in\r\nthe latter, too much milk will constantly be pressing on the lower\r\ntubes, or receptacle. They should drop naturally from the lower parts of\r\nthe bag, being neither too short, small, or dumpy, or long, flabby, and\r\nthick, but, perhaps, about three inches in length, and so thick as just\r\nto fill the hand. They should hang as if all the quarters of the udder\r\nwere equal in size, the front quarters projecting a little forward, and\r\nthe hind ones a little more dependent. Each quarter should contain about\r\nequal quantities of milk; though, in the belief of some, the hind\r\nquarters contain rather the most.\r\n\r\nLargely developed milk-veins--as the subcutaneous veins along the under\r\npart of the abdomen are commonly called--are regarded as a source of\r\nmilk. This is a popular error, for the milk-vein has no connection with\r\nthe udder; yet, although the office of these is to convey the blood from\r\nthe fore part of the chest and sides to the inguinal vein, yet a large\r\nmilk-vein certainly indicates a strongly developed vascular system--one\r\nfavorable to secretions generally, and to that of the milk among the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nMilking is performed in two ways, stripping and handling. _Stripping_\r\nconsists in seizing the teat firmly near the root between the face of\r\nthe thumb and the side of the fore-finger, the length of the teat\r\npassing through the other fingers, and in milking the hand passes down\r\nthe entire length of the teat, causing the milk to flow out of its point\r\nin a forcible stream. The action is renewed by again quickly elevating\r\nthe hand to the root of the teat. Both hands are employed at the\r\noperation, each having hold of a different teat, and being moved\r\nalternately. The two nearest teats are commonly first milked, and then\r\nthe two farthest. _Handling_ is done by grasping the teat at its root\r\nwith the fore-finger like a hoop, assisted by the thumb, which lies\r\nhorizontally over the fore-finger, the rest being also seized by the\r\nother fingers. Milk is drawn by pressing upon the entire length of the\r\nteat in alternate jerks with the entire palm of the hand. Both hands\r\nbeing thus employed, are made to press alternately, but so quickly\r\nfollowing each other that the alternate streams of milk sound to the ear\r\nlike one forcible, continued stream. This continued stream is also\r\nproduced by stripping. Stripping, then, is performed by pressing and\r\npassing certain fingers along the teat; handling, by the whole hand\r\ndoubled, or fist, pressing the teat steadily at one place. Hence the\r\norigin of both names.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PREFERABLE METHOD.]\r\n\r\nOf these two modes, handling is the preferable, since it is the more\r\nnatural method--imitating, as it does, the suckling of the calf. When a\r\ncalf takes a teat into its mouth, it makes the tongue and palate by\r\nwhich it seizes it, play upon the teat by alternate pressures or\r\npulsations, while retaining the teat in the same position. It is thus\r\nobvious that handling is somewhat like sucking, whereas stripping is\r\nnot at all like it. It is said that stripping is good for agitating the\r\nudder, the agitation of which is conducive to the withdrawal of a large\r\nquantity of milk; but there is nothing to prevent the agitation of the\r\nudder as much as the dairymaid pleases, while holding in the other mode.\r\nIndeed, a more constant vibration could be kept up in that way by the\r\nvibrations of the arms than by stripping. Stripping, by using an\r\nunconstrained pressure on two sides of the teat, is much more apt to\r\npress it unequally, than by grasping the whole teat in the palm of the\r\nhand; while the friction occasioned by passing the finger and thumb\r\nfirmly over the outside of the teat, is more likely to cause heat and\r\nirritation in it than a steady and full grasp of the entire hand. To\r\nshow that this friction causes an unpleasant feeling even to the\r\ndairymaid, she is obliged to lubricate the teat frequently with milk,\r\nand to wet it at first with water; whereas the other mode requires no\r\nsuch expedients. And as a further proof that stripping is a mode of\r\nmilking which may give pain to the cow, it cannot be employed, when the\r\nteats are chapped, with so much ease to the cow as handling.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite in the person that milks is, of course, the utmost\r\n_cleanliness_. Without this, the milk is unendurable. The udder should,\r\ntherefore, be carefully cleaned before the milking commences.\r\n\r\nMilking should be done _fast_, to draw away the milk as quickly as\r\npossible, and it should be continued as long as there is a drop of milk\r\nto bring away. This is an issue which cannot be attended to in too\r\nparticular a manner. If any milk is left, it is re-absorbed into the\r\nsystem, or else becomes caked, and diminishes the tendency to secrete a\r\nfull quantity afterward. Milking as dry as possible is especially\r\nnecessary with young cows with their first calf; as the mode of milking\r\nand the length of time to which they can be made to hold out, will have\r\nvery much to do with their milking qualities as long as they live. Old\r\nmilk left in the receptacle of the teat soon changes into a curdy state,\r\nand the caseous matter not being at once removed by the next milking, is\r\napt to irritate the lining membrane of the teat during the operation,\r\nespecially when the teat is forcibly rubbed down between the finger and\r\nthumb in stripping. The consequence of this repeated irritation is the\r\nthickening of the lining membrane, which at length becomes so hardened\r\nas to close up the orifice at the end of the teat. The hardened membrane\r\nmay be easily felt from the outside of the teat, when the teat is said\r\nto be _corded_. After this the teat becomes _deaf_, as it is called, and\r\nno more milk can afterward be drawn from the quarter of the udder to\r\nwhich the corded teat is attached.\r\n\r\nThe milking-pail is of various forms and of various materials. The Dutch\r\nuse brass ones, which are brilliantly scoured every time they are in\r\nuse. Tin pitchers are used in some places, while pails of wood in\r\ncooper-work are employed in others. A pail of oak, having thin staves\r\nbound together by bright iron hoops, with a handle formed by a stave\r\nprojecting upward, is convenient for the purpose, and may be kept clean\r\nand sweet. One nine inches in diameter at the bottom, eleven inches at\r\nthe top, and ten inches deep, with an upright handle or leg of five\r\ninches, has a capacious enough mouth to receive the milk as it descends;\r\nand a sufficient height, when standing on the edge of its bottom on the\r\nground, to allow the dairymaid to grasp it firmly with her knees while\r\nsitting on a small three-legged stool. Of course, such a pail cannot be\r\nmilked full; but it should be large enough to contain all the milk which\r\na single cow can give at a milking; because it is undesirable to rise\r\nfrom a cow before the milking is finished, or to exchange one dish for\r\nanother while the milking is in progress.\r\n\r\nThe cow being a sensitive and capricious creature, is, oftentimes so\r\neasily offended that if the maid rise from her before the milk is all\r\nwithdrawn, the chances are that she will not again stand quietly at that\r\nmilking; or, if the vessel used in milking is taken away and another\r\nsubstituted in its place, before the milking is finished, the\r\nprobability is that she will _hold_ her milk--that is, not allow it to\r\nflow. This is a curious property which cows possess, of holding up or\r\nkeeping back their milk. How it is effected has never been\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained; but there is no doubt of the fact that when\r\na cow becomes irritated, or frightened from any cause, she can withhold\r\nher milk. Of course, all cows are not affected in the same degree; but,\r\nas a proof how sensitive cows generally are, it may be mentioned that\r\nvery few will be milked so freely by a stranger the first time, as by\r\none to whom they have been accustomed.\r\n\r\nThere is one side of a cow which is usually called the _milking\r\nside_--that is the cow's left side--because, somehow custom has\r\nestablished the practice of milking her from that side. It may have been\r\nadopted for two reasons: one, because we are accustomed to approach all\r\nthe larger domesticated animals by what we call the _near side_--that\r\nis, the animal's left side--as being the most convenient one for\r\nourselves; and the other reason may have been, that, as most people are\r\nright-handed, and the common use of the right hand has made it the\r\nstronger, it is most conveniently employed in milking the hinder teats\r\nof the cow, which are often most difficult to reach on account of the\r\nposition of the hind legs and the length of the hinder teats, or of the\r\nbreadth of the hinder part of the udder. The near side is most commonly\r\nused in this country and in Scotland; but in many parts of England the\r\nother side is preferred. Whichever side is selected, that should\r\nuniformly be used, as cows are very sensitive to changes.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland it is a rare thing to see a cow milked by any other person\r\nthan a woman, though men are very commonly employed at it in this\r\ncountry and in England. One never sees a man milking a cow without being\r\nimpressed with the idea that he is usurping an office which does not\r\nbecome him; and the same thought seems to be conveyed in the terms\r\nusually applied to the person connected with cows--a dairy-_maid_\r\nimplying one who milks cows, as well as performs the other duties\r\nconnected with the dairy--a dairy-_man_ meaning one who owns a dairy.\r\nThere can be but little question that the charge of this branch of the\r\ndairy should generally be entrusted to women. They are more gentle and\r\nwinning than men. The same person should milk the same cow regularly,\r\nand not change from one to another, unless there are special reasons for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCows are easily rendered troublesome on being milked; and the kicks and\r\nknocks which they usually receive for their restlessness, only render\r\nthem more fretful. If they cannot be overcome by kindness, thumps will\r\nnever make them better. The truth is, restless habits are continued in\r\nthem by the treatment which they receive at first, when, most probably,\r\nthey have been dragooned into submission. Their teats are tender at\r\nfirst; but an unfeeling, horny hand tugs at them at stripping, as if the\r\nanimal had been accustomed to the operation for years. Can the creature\r\nbe otherwise than uneasy? And how can she escape the wincing but by\r\nflinging out her heels?--Then hopples are placed on the hind fetlocks,\r\nto keep her heels down. The tail must then be held by some one, while\r\nthe milking is going on; or the hair of its tuft be converted into a\r\ndouble cord, to tie the tail to the animal's leg. Add to this the many\r\nthreats and scoldings uttered by the milker, and one gets a not very\r\nexaggerated impression of the \"breaking-in.\"\r\n\r\nSome cows, no doubt, are very unaccomodating and provoking; but,\r\nnevertheless, nothing but a rational course toward them, administered\r\nwith gentleness, will ever render them less so. There are cows which are\r\ntroublesome to milk for a few times after calving, that become quite\r\nquiet for the remainder of the season; others will kick pertinaciously\r\nat the first milking. In this last case the safest plan--instead of\r\nhoppling, which only irritates--is for the dairymaid to thrust her head\r\nagainst the flank of the cow, and while standing on her feet, stretch\r\nher hands forward, get hold of the teats the best way she can, and send\r\nthe milk on the ground; and in this position it is out of the power of\r\nthe cow to hurt her. These ebullitions of feeling at the first milking\r\nafter calving, arise either from feeling pain in a tender state of the\r\nteat, most probably from inflammation in the lining membrane of the\r\nreceptacle; or they may arise from titillation of the skin of the udder\r\nand teat, which becomes the more sensible to the affection from a heat\r\nwhich is wearing off.\r\n\r\nAt the age of two or three years the milking glands have not become\r\nfully developed, and their largest development will depend very greatly\r\nupon the management after the first calf. Cows should have, therefore,\r\nthe most milk-producing food; be treated with constant gentleness; never\r\nstruck, or spoken harshly to, but coaxed and caressed; and in\r\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred, they will grow up gentle and quiet.\r\nThe hundredth had better be fatted and sent to the butcher. Harshness is\r\nworse than useless. Be the cause of irritation what it may, one thing is\r\ncertain, that gentle discipline will overcome the most turbulent temper.\r\nNothing does so much to dry a cow up, especially a young cow, as the\r\nsenseless treatment to which she is too often subjected.\r\n\r\nThe longer the young cow, with her first and second calf, is made to\r\nhold out, the more surely will this habit be fixed upon her. Stop\r\nmilking her four months before the next calf, and it will be difficult\r\nto make her hold out to within four or six weeks of the time of calving\r\nafterward. Induce her, if possible, by moist and succulent food, and by\r\ncareful milking, to hold out even up to the time of calving, if you\r\ndesire to milk her so long, and this habit will be likely to be fixed\r\nupon her for life. But do not expect to obtain the full yield of a cow\r\nthe first year after calving. Some of the very best cows are slow to\r\ndevelop their best qualities; and no cow reaches her prime till the age\r\nof five or six years.\r\n\r\nThe extreme importance of care and attention to these points cannot be\r\noverestimated. The wild cows grazing on the plains of South America, are\r\nsaid to give not more than three or four quarts a day at the height of\r\nthe flow; and many an owner of large herds in Texas, it is said, has too\r\nlittle milk for family use, and sometimes receives his supply of butter\r\nfrom the New York market. There is, therefore, a constant tendency in\r\nmilch cows to dry up; and it must be guarded against with special care,\r\ntill the habit of yielding a large quantity, and yielding it long,\r\nbecomes fixed in the young animal, when, with proper care, it may easily\r\nbe kept up.\r\n\r\nCows, independently of their power to retain their milk in the udder,\r\nafford different degrees of pleasure in milking them, even in the\r\nquietest mood. Some yield their milk in a copious flow, with the\r\ngentlest handling that can be given them; others require great exertion\r\nto draw the milk from them even in streams no larger than a thread. The\r\nudder of the former will be found to have a soft skin and short teats;\r\nthat of the latter will have a thick skin, with long rough teats. The\r\none feels like velvet; the other is no more pleasant to the touch than\r\nuntanned leather. To induce quiet and persuade the animal to give down\r\nher milk freely, it is better that she should be fed at milking-time\r\nwith cut feed, or roots, placed within her easy reach.\r\n\r\nIf gentle and mild treatment is observed and persevered in, the\r\noperation of milking, as a general thing, appears to be a pleasure to\r\nthe animal, as it undoubtedly is; but, if an opposite course is\r\npursued--if at every restless movement, caused, perhaps, by pressing a\r\nsore teat, the animal is harshly spoken to--she will be likely to learn\r\nto kick as a habit, and it will be difficult to overcome it ever\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the practice on other occasions, there can be no doubt\r\nthat, for some weeks after calving, and in the height of the flow, cows\r\nought, if possible, to be milked regularly three times a day--at early\r\nmorning, noon, and night. Every practical dairyman knows that cows thus\r\nmilked give a larger quantity of milk than if milked only twice, though\r\nit may not be quite so rich; and in young cows, no doubt, it has a\r\ntendency to promote the development of the udder and milk-veins. A\r\nfrequent milking stimulates an increased secretion, therefore, and ought\r\nnever to be neglected in the milk-dairy, either in the case of young\r\ncows, or very large milkers, at the height of the flow, which will\r\ncommonly be for two or three months after calving.\r\n\r\nThere being a great difference in the quality as well as in the quantity\r\nof the milk of different cows, no dairyman should neglect to test the\r\nmilk of each new addition to his dairy stock, whether it be an animal of\r\nhis own raising or one brought from abroad. A lactometer--or instrument\r\nfor testing the comparative richness of different species of milk--is\r\nvery convenient for this purpose; but any one can set the milk of each\r\ncow separately at first, and give it a thorough trial, when the\r\ndifference will be found to be great. Economy will dictate that the cows\r\nleast to the purpose should be disposed of, and their places supplied\r\nwith better ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAISING OF CALVES.\r\n\r\nIt has been found in practice that calves properly bred and raised on\r\nthe farm have a far greater intrinsic value for that farm, other things\r\nbeing equal, than any that can be procured elsewhere; while on the\r\nmanner in which they are raised will depend much of their future\r\nusefulness and profit. These considerations should have their proper\r\nweight in deciding whether a promising calf from a good cow and bull\r\nshall be kept, or sold to the butcher. But, rather than raise a calf at\r\nhap-hazard, and simply because its dam was celebrated as a milker, the\r\njudicious farmer will prefer to judge of the peculiar characteristics of\r\nthe animal itself. This will often save the great and useless outlay\r\nwhich has sometimes been incurred in raising calves for dairy purposes,\r\nwhich a more careful examination would have rejected as unpromising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATERNAL AFFECTION.]\r\n\r\nThe method of judging stock which has been recommended in the previous\r\npages is of practical utility here, and it is safer to rely upon it to\r\nsome extent, particularly when other appearances concur, than to go on\r\nblindly. The milk-mirror on the calf is, indeed, small, but no smaller\r\nin proportion to its size than that of the cow; while its shape and form\r\ncan generally be distinctly seen, particularly at the end of ten or\r\ntwelve weeks. The development of the udder, and other peculiarities,\r\nwill give some indication of the future capacities of the animal, and\r\nthese should be carefully studied. If we except the manure of young\r\nstock, the calf is the first product of the cow, and as such demands our\r\nattention, whether it is to be raised or hurried off to the shambles.\r\nThe practice adopted in raising calves differs widely in different\r\nsections of the country, being governed very much by local\r\ncircumstances, as the vicinity of a milk-market, the value of milk for\r\nthe dairy, the object of breeding, whether mainly for beef, for work, or\r\nfor the dairy, etc.; but, in general, it may be said, that, within the\r\nrange of thirty or forty miles of good veal-markets, which large towns\r\nfurnish, comparatively few are raised at all. Most of them are fattened\r\nand sold at ages varying from three to eight or ten weeks; and in\r\nmilk-dairies still nearer large towns and cities they are often hurried\r\noff at one or two days, or, at most, a week old. In both of these cases,\r\nas long as the calf is kept it is generally allowed to suck the cow,\r\nand, as the treatment is very simple, there is nothing which\r\nparticularly calls for remark, unless it be to condemn the practice\r\nentirely, upon the ground that there is a more profitable way of\r\nfattening calves for the butcher, and to say that allowing the calf to\r\nsuck the cow at all is objectionable on the score of economy, except in\r\ncases where it is rendered necessary by the hard and swollen condition\r\nof the udder.\r\n\r\nIf the calf is so soon to be taken away, it is better that the cow\r\nshould not be suffered to become attached to it at all: since she is\r\ninclined to withhold her milk when it is removed, and thus a loss is\r\nsustained. The farmer will be governed by the question of profit,\r\nwhatever course it is decided to adopt. In raising blood-stock, however,\r\nor in raising beef cattle, without any regard to economy of milk, the\r\nsystem of suckling the calves, or letting them run with the cow, may\r\nand will be adopted, since it is usually attended with somewhat less\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nThe other course, which is regarded as the best where the calf is to be\r\nraised for the dairy, is to bring it up by hand. This is almost\r\nuniversally done in all countries where the raising of dairy cows is\r\nbest understood--in Switzerland, Holland, some parts of Germany, and\r\nEngland. It requires rather more care, on the whole; but it is decidedly\r\npreferable, since the calves cost less, as the food can be easily\r\nmodified, and the growth is not checked, as is usually the case when the\r\ncalf is taken off from the cow. Allusion is here made, of course, to\r\nsections where the milk of the cow is of some account for the dairy, and\r\nwhere it is too valuable to be devoted entirely to nourishing the calf.\r\nIn this case, as soon as the calf is dropped the cow is allowed to lick\r\noff the slimy moisture till it is dry, which she will generally do from\r\ninstinct, or, if not, a slight sprinkling of salt over the body of the\r\ncalf will immediately tempt her. The calf is left to suck once or twice,\r\nwhich it will do as soon as it is able to stand. It should, in all\r\ncases, be permitted to have the first milk which comes from the cow,\r\nwhich is of a turbid, yellowish color, unfit for any of the purposes of\r\nthe dairy, but somewhat purgative and medicinal, and admirably and\r\nwisely designed by Nature to free the bowels and intestines of the\r\nnew-born animal from the mucous, excrementitious matter always existing\r\nin it after birth. Too much of this new milk may, however, be hurtful\r\neven to the new-born calf, while it should never be given at all to\r\nolder calves. The best course would seem to be--and such is in\r\naccordance with the experience of the most successful stock-raisers--to\r\nmilk the cow dry immediately after the calf has sucked once, especially\r\nif the udder is painfully distended, which is often the case, and to\r\nleave the calf with the cow during one day, and after that to feed it by\r\nputting the fingers into its mouth, and gently bringing its muzzle down\r\nto the milk in a pail or trough when it will imbibe in sucking the\r\nfingers. No great difficulty will be experienced in teaching the calf to\r\ndrink when taken so young, though some take to it much more readily than\r\nothers. What the calf does not need should be given to the cow. Some,\r\nhowever, prefer to milk immediately after calving; and, if the udder is\r\noverloaded, this may be the best course, though the better practice\r\nappears to be, to leave the cow as quietly to herself as possible for a\r\nfew hours. The less she is disturbed, as a general thing, the better.\r\nThe after-birth should be taken from her immediately after it is\r\ndropped. It is customary to give the cow, as soon as convenient after\r\ncalving, some warm and stimulating drink--a little meal stirred into\r\nwarm water, with a part of the first milk which comes from her, seasoned\r\nwith a little salt.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the calf is taken from the cow immediately; and before she\r\nhas seen it, to a warm, dry pen out of her sight, and there rubbed till\r\nit is thoroughly dry; and then, when able to stand, fed with the new\r\nmilk from the cow, which it should have three or four times a day,\r\nregularly, for the first fortnight, whatever course it is proposed to\r\nadopt afterwards. It is of the greatest importance to give the young\r\ncalf a thrifty start. The milk, unless coming directly from the cow,\r\nshould be warmed.\r\n\r\nSome object to removing the calf from the cow in this way, on the\r\nground of its apparent cruelty. But the objection to letting the calf\r\nsuck the cow for several days, as they do, or indeed of leaving it with\r\nthe cow for any length of time, is, that she invariably becomes attached\r\nto it, and frets and withholds her milk when it is at last taken from\r\nher. She probably suffers much more, after this attachment is once\r\nformed, at the removal of the object of it, than she does at its being\r\ntaken at first out of her sight. The cow's memory is far more retentive\r\nthan many suppose; and the loss and injury sustained by removing the\r\ncalf after it has been allowed to suck her for a longer or shorter\r\nperiod are never known exactly, because it is not usually known how much\r\nmilk the calf takes; but it is, without doubt, very considerable. If the\r\nudder is all right, there seems to be no good reason for leaving the\r\ncalf with the cow for two or three days, if it is then to be taken away.\r\n\r\nThe practice in Holland is to remove the calf from its mother even\r\nbefore it has been licked, and to take it into a corner of the barn, or\r\ninto another building, out of the cow's sight and hearing, put it on\r\nsoft, dry straw, and rub it dry with some hay or straw, when its tongue\r\nand gums are slightly rubbed with salt, and the mucus and saliva removed\r\nfrom the nostrils and lips. After this has been done, the calf is made\r\nto drink the milk first taken as it comes from the mother. It is\r\nslightly diluted with water, if taken last from the udder; but, if the\r\nfirst of the milking, it is given just as it is. The calf is taught to\r\ndrink in the same manner as in this country, by putting the fingers in\r\nits mouth, and bringing it down to the milk, and it soon gets so as to\r\ndrink unaided. It is fed, at first, from four to six times a day, or\r\neven oftener; but soon only three times, at regular intervals. Its food\r\nfor two or three weeks is clear milk, as it comes warm and fresh from\r\nthe cow. This is never omitted, as the milk during most of that time\r\npossesses certain qualities which are necessary to the calf, and which\r\ncannot be effectually supplied by any other food. In the third or fourth\r\nweek the milk is skimmed, but warmed to the degree of fresh milk;\r\nthough, as the calf grows a little older, the milk is given cold, while\r\nless care is taken to give it the milk of its own mother, that of other\r\ncows now answering equally well. In some places, calves are fed on\r\nbuttermilk at the age of two weeks and after; but the change from new\r\nmilk, fresh from the cow, is made gradually, some sweet skimmed milk and\r\nwarm water being first added to it.\r\n\r\nAt three weeks old, or thereabouts, the calf will begin to eat a little\r\nsweet, fine hay, and potatoes cut fine, and it very soon becomes\r\naccustomed to this food. Many now begin to give linseed-meal mixed into\r\nhot water, to which is added some skim-milk or buttermilk; and others\r\nuse a little bran cooked in hay-tea, made by chopping the hay fine and\r\npouring on boiling-hot water, which is allowed to stand awhile on it. An\r\negg is frequently broken into such a mixture. Others still take pains at\r\nthis age to have fresh linseed-cake, broken into pieces of the size of a\r\npigeon's egg; putting one of these into the mouth after the meal of milk\r\nhas been finished, and when it is eager to suck at any thing in its way.\r\nIt will very soon learn to eat linseed-meal. A little sweet clover is\r\nput in its way at the age of about three weeks, and it will soon begin\r\nto eat that also.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the feeding is continued from the fourth to the seventh\r\nweek, the quantity of solid food being gradually increased. In the sixth\r\nor seventh week the milk is by degrees withheld, and water or buttermilk\r\nused instead; and soon after this, green food may be safely given,\r\nincreasing it gradually with the hay to the age of ten or twelve weeks,\r\nwhen it will do to put them upon grass alone, if the season is\r\nfavorable. A lot as near the house as possible, where they can be easily\r\nlooked after and frequently visited, is the best. Calves should be\r\ngradually accustomed to all changes; and even after having been turned\r\nout to pasture, they ought to be put under shelter if the weather is not\r\ndry and warm. The want of care and attention relative to these little\r\ndetails will be apparent sooner or later; while, if the farmer gives his\r\npersonal attention to these matters, he will be fully paid in the rapid\r\ngrowth of his calves. It is especially necessary to see that the troughs\r\nfrom which they are fed, if troughs are used, are kept clean and sweet.\r\n\r\nBut there are some--even among intelligent farmers--who make a practice\r\nof turning their calves out to pasture at the tender age of two or three\r\nweeks--and that, too, when they have sucked the cow up to that time--and\r\nallow them nothing in the shape of milk and tender care. This,\r\ncertainly, is the poorest possible economy, to say nothing of the\r\nmanifest cruelty of such treatment. The growth of the calf is checked,\r\nand the system receives a shock from so sudden a change, from which it\r\ncannot soon recover. The careful Dutch breeders bring the calves either\r\nskimmed milk or buttermilk to drink several times a day after they are\r\nturned to grass, which is not till the age of ten or twelve weeks; and,\r\nif the weather is chilly, the milk is warmed for them. They put a\r\ntrough generally under a covering, to which the calves may come and\r\ndrink at regular times. Thus, they are kept tame and docile.\r\n\r\nIn the raising of calves, through all stages of their growth, great care\r\nshould be taken neither to starve nor to over-feed. A calf should never\r\nbe surfeited, and never be fed so highly that it cannot be fed more\r\nhighly as it advances. The most important part is to keep it growing\r\nthriftily without getting too fat, if it is to be raised for the dairy.\r\n\r\nThe calves in the dairy districts of Scotland are fed on the milk, with\r\nseldom any admixture; and they are not permitted to suck their dams, but\r\nare taught to drink milk by the hand from a dish. They are generally fed\r\non milk only for the first four, five, or six weeks, and are then\r\nallowed from two to two and a half quarts of new milk each meal, twice\r\nin the twenty-four hours. Some never give them any other food when young\r\nexcept milk, lessening the quantity when the calf begins to eat grass or\r\nother food, which it generally does when about five weeks old, if grass\r\ncan be had; and withdrawing it entirely about the seventh or eighth week\r\nof the calf's age. But, if the calf is reared in winter, or early in\r\nspring, before the grass rises, it must be supplied with at least some\r\nmilk until it is eight or nine weeks old, as a calf will not so soon\r\nlearn to eat hay or straw, nor fare so well on them alone as it will on\r\npasture. Some feed their calves reared for stock partly with meal mixed\r\nin the milk after the third or fourth week. Others introduce gradually\r\nsome new whey into the milk, first mixed with meal; and, when the calf\r\ngets older, they withdraw the milk, and feed it on whey and porridge.\r\nHay-tea, juices of peas and beans, or pea or bean-straw, linseed beaten\r\ninto powder, treacle, etc., have all been sometimes used to advantage in\r\nfeeding calves; but milk, when it can be spared, is, in the judgment of\r\nthe Scotch breeders, by far their most natural food.\r\n\r\nIn Galloway, and other pastoral districts, where the calves are allowed\r\nto suck, the people are so much wedded to their own customs as to argue\r\nthat suckling is much more nutritious to the calves than any other mode\r\nof feeding. That it induces a greater secretion of saliva, which, by\r\npromoting digestion, accelerates the growth and fattening of the young\r\nanimal, cannot be doubted; but the secretion of that fluid may likewise\r\nbe promoted by placing an artificial teat in the mouth of the calf, and\r\ngiving it the milk slowly, and at the natural temperature. In the dairy\r\ndistricts of Scotland, the dairymaid puts one of her fingers into the\r\nmouth of the calf when it is fed, which serves the purpose of a teat,\r\nand will have nearly the same effect as the natural teat in inducing the\r\nsecretion of saliva. If that, or an artificial teat of leather, be used,\r\nand the milk be given slowly before it is cold, the secretion of saliva\r\nmay be promoted to all the extent that can be necessary; besides,\r\nsecretion is not confined to the mere period of eating, but, as in the\r\nhuman body, the saliva is formed and part of it swallowed at all times.\r\nAs part of the saliva is sometimes seen dropping from the mouths of the\r\ncalves, it might be advisable not only to give them an artificial teat\r\nwhen fed, but to place, as is frequently done, a lump of chalk before\r\nthem to lick, thus leading them to swallow the saliva. The chalk would\r\nso far supply the want of salt, of which cattle are often so improperly\r\ndeprived, and it would also promote the formation of saliva. Indeed,\r\ncalves are very much disposed to lick and suck every thing which comes\r\nwithin their reach, which seems to be the way in which Nature teaches\r\nthem to supply their stomachs with saliva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROLICKSOME.]\r\n\r\nBut though sucking their dams may be most advantageous in that respect,\r\nyet it has also some disadvantages. The cow is always more injured than\r\nthe calf is benefited by that mode of feeding. She becomes so fond of\r\nthe calf that she does not, for a long time after, yield her milk freely\r\nto the dairyman. The calf does not when young draw off the milk\r\ncompletely, and when it is taken off by the hand, the cow withholds a\r\npart of her milk, and, whenever a cow's udder is not completely emptied\r\nevery time she is milked, the lactic secretion--as before stated--is\r\nthereby diminished.\r\n\r\nFeeding of calves by hand is also, in various respects, advantageous.\r\nInstead of depending on the uncertain, or perhaps precarious supply of\r\nthe dam, which may be more at first than the young animal can consume or\r\ndigest, and at other times too little for its supply, its food can, by\r\nhand-feeding, be regulated to suit the age, appetite, and the purposes\r\nfor which the calf is intended; other admixtures or substitutes can be\r\nintroduced into the milk, and the quantity gradually increased or\r\nwithdrawn at pleasure. This is highly necessary when the calves are\r\nreared for stock. The milk is in that case diminished, and other food\r\nintroduced so gradually that the stomach of the young animal is not\r\ninjured as it is when the food is too suddenly changed. And, in the case\r\nof feeding calves for the butcher, the quantity of milk is not limited\r\nto that of the dam--for no cow will allow a stranger-calf to suck\r\nher--but it can be increased, or the richest or poorest parts of the\r\nmilk given at pleasure.\r\n\r\nSuch are, substantially, the views upon this subject which are\r\nentertained by the most judicious farmers in the first dairy districts\r\nof Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn those districts--where, probably, the feeding and management of\r\ncalves are as well and as judiciously conducted as in any other part of\r\nGreat Britain--the farmers' wives and daughters, or the female\r\ndomestics, have the principal charge of young calves; and they are,\r\ndoubtless, much better calculated for this duty than men, since they are\r\nmore inclined to be gentle and patient. The utmost gentleness--as has\r\nbeen already remarked, in another connection--should always be observed\r\nin the treatment of all stock; but especially of milch cows, and calves\r\ndesigned for the dairy. Persevering kindness and patience, will, almost\r\ninvariably, overcome the most obstinate natures; while rough and\r\nungentle handling will be repaid in a quiet kind of way, perhaps, by\r\nwithholding the milk, which will always have a tendency to dry up the\r\ncow; or, what is nearly as bad, by kicking and other modes of revenge,\r\nwhich often contribute to the personal discomfort of the milker. The\r\ndisposition of the cow is greatly modified, if not, indeed, wholly\r\nformed, by her treatment while young; and therefore it is best to handle\r\ncalves as much as possible, and make pets of them, lead them with a\r\nhalter, and caress them in various ways. Calves managed in this way will\r\nalways be docile, and suffer themselves to be approached and handled,\r\nboth in the pasture and in the barn.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the use of hay-tea--often used in this country, but more\r\ncommon abroad, where greater care and attention are usually bestowed\r\nupon the details of breeding--Youatt says: \"At the end of three or four\r\ndays, or perhaps a week, or near a fortnight, after a calf has been\r\ndropped, and the first passages have been cleansed by allowing it to\r\ndrink as much of the cow's milk as it feels inclined for, let the\r\nquantity usually allotted for a meal be mixed, consisting, for the first\r\nweek, of three parts of milk and one part of hay-tea. _The only\r\nnourishing infusion of hay is that which is made from the best and\r\nsweetest hay, cut by a chaff-cutter into pieces about two inches long_,\r\nand put into an earthen vessel; over this, boiling water should be\r\npoured, and the whole allowed to stand for two hours, during which time\r\nit ought to be kept carefully closed. After the first week, the\r\nproportions of milk and hay-tea may be equal; then composed of\r\ntwo-thirds of hay-tea and one of milk; and at length, one-fourth part of\r\nmilk will be sufficient. This food should be given to the calf in a\r\nlukewarm state _at least three, if not four times a day, in quantities\r\naveraging three quarts at a meal_, but gradually increasing to four\r\nquarts as the calf grows older. Toward the end of the second month,\r\nbeside the usual quantity given at each meal--composed of three parts of\r\nthe infusion and one of milk--a small wisp or bundle of hay is to be\r\nlaid before the calf, which will gradually come to eat it; but, if the\r\nweather is favorable, as in the month of May, the beast may be turned\r\nout to graze in a fine, sweet pasture, well sheltered from the wind and\r\nsun. This diet may be continued until toward the latter end of the third\r\nmonth, when, if the calf grazes heartily, each meal may be reduced to\r\nless than a quart of milk, with hay-water; or skimmed milk, or fresh\r\nbuttermilk, may be substituted for new milk. At the expiration of the\r\nthird month, the animal will hardly require to be fed by hand; though,\r\nif this should still be necessary, one quart of the infusion given\r\ndaily--which, during the summer, need not be warmed--will suffice.\" The\r\nhay-tea should be made fresh every two days, as it soon loses its\r\nnutritious quality.\r\n\r\nThis and other preparations are given, not because they are better than\r\nmilk,--than which nothing is better adapted to fatten a calf, or promote\r\nits growth,--but simply to economize by providing the simplest and\r\ncheapest substitutes. Experience shows that the first two or three\r\ncalves are smaller than those which follow; and hence, unless they are\r\npure-bred, and to be kept for the blood, they are not generally thought\r\nto be so desirable to raise for the dairy as the third or fourth, and\r\nthose that come after, up to the age of nine or ten years. Opinions upon\r\nthis point, however, differ.\r\n\r\nAccording to the comparative experiments of a German agriculturist, cows\r\nwhich as calves had been allowed to suck their dams from two to four\r\nweeks, brought calves which weighed only from thirty-five to forty-eight\r\npounds; while others, which as calves had been allowed to suck from five\r\nto eight weeks, brought calves which weighed from sixty to eighty\r\npounds. It is difficult to see how there can be so great a difference,\r\nif, indeed, there be any; but it may be worthy of careful observation\r\nand experiment, and as such it is stated here. The increased size of the\r\ncalf would be due to the increased size to which the cow would attain;\r\nand if as a calf she were allowed to run in the pasture with her dam for\r\nfour or five months, taking all the milk she wanted, she would doubtless\r\nbe kept growing on in a thriving condition. But taking a calf from the\r\ncow at four or even eight weeks must check its growth to some extent;\r\nand this may be avoided by feeding liberally, and bringing up by hand.\r\n\r\nAfter the calf is fully weaned, there is nothing very peculiar in the\r\ngeneral management. A young animal will require for the first few\r\nmonths--say up to the age of six months--an average of five or six\r\npounds daily of good hay, or its equivalent. At the age of six months,\r\nit will require from four and a half to five pounds; and at the end of\r\nthe year, from three and a half or four pounds of good hay, or its\r\nequivalent, for every one hundred pounds of its live weight; or, in\r\nother words, about three and a half or four per cent. of its live\r\nweight. At two years old, it will require three and a half, and some\r\nmonths later, three per cent. of its live weight daily in good hay, or\r\nits equivalent. Indian-corn fodder, either green or cured, forms an\r\nexcellent and wholesome food at this age.\r\n\r\nThe heifer should not be pampered, nor yet poorly fed or half starved,\r\nso as to receive a check in her growth. An abundant supply of good\r\nhealthy dairy food and milk will do all that is necessary up to the time\r\nof her having her first calf--which should not ordinarily be till the\r\nage of three years, though some choose to allow them to come in at two,\r\nor a little over, on the ground that it early stimulates the secretion\r\nof milk, and that this will increase the milking propensity through\r\nlife. This is undoubtedly the case, as a general rule; but greater\r\ninjury is at the same time done by checking the growth, unless the\r\nheifer has been fed up to large size and full development from the\r\nstart--in which case she may perhaps take the bull at fifteen or\r\neighteen months without injury. Even if a heifer comes in at two years,\r\nit is generally deemed desirable to let her run barren for the following\r\nyear, which will promote her growth and more perfect development.\r\n\r\nThe feeding which young stock often get is not such as is calculated to\r\nmake good-sized or valuable cattle of them. They are often fed on the\r\npoorest of hay or straw through the winter, not infrequently left\r\nexposed to cold, unprotected and unhoused, and thus stinted in their\r\ngrowth. This is, surely, the very worst economy, or rather it is no\r\neconomy at all. Properly viewed, it is an extravagant wastefulness which\r\nno farmer can afford. No animal develops its good points under such\r\ntreatment; and if the starving system is to be followed at all, it had\r\nbetter be after the age of two or three years, when the animal's\r\nconstitution has attained the strength and vigor which may, possibly,\r\nenable it to resist ill treatment.\r\n\r\nTo raise up first-rate milkers, it is absolutely necessary to feed on\r\ndairy food even when they are young. No matter how fine the breed is, if\r\nthe calf is raised on poor, short feed, it will never be so good a\r\nmilker as if raised on better keeping; and hence, in dairy districts,\r\nwhere calves are raised at all, they ought to be allowed the best\r\npasture during the summer, and good, sweet and wholesome food during\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF FAT CATTLE.\r\n\r\nWhatever theoretical objections may be raised against over-fed cattle,\r\nand great as may be the attempts to disparage the mountains of fat,--as\r\nhighly-fed cattle are sometimes designated,--there is no doubt of the\r\npractical fact, that the best butcher cannot sell any thing but the best\r\nfatted beef; and of whatever age, size, or shape a half-fatted ox may\r\nbe, he is never selected by judges as fit for human food. Hence, a\r\nwell-fatted animal always commands a better price per pound than one\r\nimperfectly fed, and the parts selected as the primest beef are\r\nprecisely the parts which contain the largest deposits of fat. The rump,\r\nthe crop, and the sirloin, the very favorite cuts,--which always command\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-five per cent. more than any other part of the\r\nox,--are just those parts on which the largest quantities of fat are\r\nfound; so that, instead of the taste and fashion of the age being\r\nagainst the excessive fattening of animals, the fact is, practically,\r\nexactly the reverse. Where there is the most fat, there is the best\r\nlean; where there is the greatest amount of muscle, without its share of\r\nfat, that part is accounted inferior, and is used for a different\r\npurpose; in fact, so far from fat's being a disease, it is a condition\r\nof muscle, necessary to its utility as food,--a source of luxury to the\r\nrich, and of comfort to the poor, furnishing a nourishing and healthy\r\ndiet for their families.\r\n\r\nFattening is a secretive power which grazing animals possess, enabling\r\nthem to lay by a store of the superfluous food which they take for\r\nseasons of cold or scarcity. It collects round the angular bones of the\r\nanimal, and gives the appearance of rotundity; hence the tendency to\r\ndeposit fat is indicated, as has been stated, by a _roundness_ of form,\r\nas opposed to the _fatness_ of a milk-secreting animal. But its greatest\r\nuse is, that it is a store of heat-producing aliment, laid up for\r\nseasons of scarcity and want. The food of animals, for the most part,\r\nmay be said to consist of a saccharine, an oleaginous, and an albuminous\r\nprinciple. To the first belong all the starchy, saccharine, and gummy\r\nparts of the plants, which undergo changes in the digestive organs\r\nsimilar to fermentation before they can be assimilated in the system; by\r\nthem also animal heat is sustained. In indolent animals, the oily parts\r\nof plants are deposited and laid up as fat; and, when vigor and strength\r\nfail, this is taken up and also used in breathing to supply the place of\r\nthe consumed saccharine matter. The albuminous, or gelatinous principle\r\nof plants is mainly useful in forming muscle; while the ashes of plants,\r\nthe unconsumable parts, are for the supply, mainly, of bone, hair, and\r\nhorn, but also of muscle and of blood, and to supply the waste which\r\ncontinually goes on.\r\n\r\nNow, there are several qualities which are essentially characteristic of\r\na disposition to fatten. There have not, as yet, been any book-rules\r\nlaid down, as in the case of M. Guénon's indications of milking-cows;\r\nbut there are, nevertheless, marks so definite and well understood, that\r\nthey are comprehended and acted upon by every grazier, although they are\r\nby no means easy to describe. It is by skillful acumen that the grazier\r\nacquires his knowledge, and not by theoretical rules; observation,\r\njudgment, and experience, powerful perceptive faculties, and a keen and\r\nminute comparison and discrimination, are essential to his success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POINTS OF CATTLE.]\r\n\r\nThe first indication upon which he relies, is the _touch_. It is the\r\nabsolute criterion of _quality_, which is supposed to be the keystone of\r\nperfection in all animals, whether for the pail or the butcher. The skin\r\nis so intimately connected with the internal organs, in all animals,\r\nthat it is questionable whether even our schools of medicine might not\r\nmake more use of it in a diagnosis of disease. Of physiological\r\ntendencies in cattle, however, it is of the last and most vital\r\nimportance. It must neither be thick, nor hard, nor adhere firmly to the\r\nmuscles. If it is so, the animal is a hard grazer, a difficult and\r\nobstinate feeder--no skillful man will purchase it--such a creature must\r\ngo to a novice, and even to him at a price so low as to tempt him to\r\nbecome a purchaser. On the other hand, the skin must not be thin, like\r\npaper, nor flaccid, nor loose in the hand, nor flabby. This is the\r\nopposite extreme, and is indicative of delicateness, bad, flabby flesh,\r\nand, possibly, of inaptitude to retain the fat. It must be _elastic_ and\r\nvelvety, soft and pliable, presenting to the touch a gentle resistance,\r\nbut so delicate as to give pleasure to the sensitive hand--a skin, in\r\nshort, which seems at first to give an indentation from the pressure of\r\nthe fingers, but which again rises to its place by a gentle elasticity.\r\n\r\nThe _hair_ is of nearly as much importance as the skin. A hard skin will\r\nhave straight and stiff hair; it will not have a curl, but be thinly and\r\nlankly distributed equally over the surface. A proper grazing animal\r\nwill have a _mossy_ coat, not absolutely curled, but having a\r\ndisposition to a graceful curl, a semifold, which presents a waving\r\ninequality; but as different from a close and straightly-laid coat, as\r\nit is from one standing off the animal at right angles, a strong symptom\r\nof disease. It will also, in a thriving animal, be licked here and there\r\nwith its tongue, a proof that the skin is duly performing its functions.\r\n\r\nThere must be, also, the full and goggle _eye_, bright and pressed\r\noutward by the fatty bed below; because, as this is a part where Nature\r\nalways provides fat, an animal capable of developing it to any\r\nconsiderable extent, will have its indications here, at least, when it\r\nexists in excess.\r\n\r\nSo much for feeding qualities in the animal, and their conformations\r\nindicative of this kindly disposition. Next come such formations of the\r\nanimal itself as are favorable to the growth of fat, other things being\r\nequal. There must be _size_ where large weights are expected. Christmas\r\nbeef, for instance, is expected to be large as well as fat. The symbol\r\nof festivity should be capacious, as well as prime in quality. But it is\r\nso much a matter of choice and circumstance with the grazier, that\r\nprofit alone will be his guide. The axiom will be, however, as a general\r\nrule, that the better the grazing soil the larger the animal may be; the\r\npoorer the soil, the smaller the animal. Small animals are,\r\nunquestionably, much more easily fed, and they are well known by\r\nexperienced men to be best adapted to second-rate feeding pastures.\r\n\r\nBut, beyond this, there must be _breadth_ of carcass. This is indicative\r\nof fattening, perhaps, beyond all other qualifications. If rumps are\r\nfavorite joints and produce the best price, it is best to have the\r\nanimal which will grow the longest, the broadest, and the best rump; the\r\nsame of crop, and the same of sirloin; and not only so, but breadth is\r\nessential to the consumption of that quantity of food which is necessary\r\nto the development of a large amount of fat in the animal. Thus, a deep,\r\nwide chest, favorable for the respiratory and circulating functions,\r\nenables it to consume a large amount of food, to take up the sugary\r\nmatter, and to deposit the fatty matter,--as then useless for\r\nrespiration, but afterwards to be prized. A full level crop will be of\r\nthe same physiological utility; while a broad and open framework at the\r\nhips will afford scope for the action of the liver and kidneys.\r\n\r\nThere are other points, also, of much importance; the head must be small\r\nand fine; its special use is indicative of the quick fattening of the\r\nanimal so constructed, and it is also indicative of the bones being\r\nsmall and the legs short. For constitutional powers, the beast should\r\nhave his ribs extended well towards the thigh-bones or hips, so as to\r\nleave as little unprotected space as possible. There must be no\r\nangular, or abrupt points; all must be round, and broad, and parallel.\r\nAny depression in the lean animal will give a deficient deposit of flesh\r\nand fat at that point, when sold to the butcher, and thus deteriorate\r\nits value; and hence the animal must be round and full.\r\n\r\nBut either fancy, or accident, or skill--it is unnecessary to decide\r\nwhich--has associated _symmetry_ with quality and conformation, as a\r\npoint of great importance in animals calculated for fattening; and there\r\nis no doubt that, to a certain extent, this is so. The beast must be a\r\nsystem of mathematical lines. To the advocate of symmetry, the\r\nsetting-on of a tail will be a condemning fault; indeed the ridge of the\r\nback, like a straight line, with the outline of the belly exactly\r\nparallel, viewed from the side, and a depth and squareness when viewed\r\nfrom behind,--which remind us of a geometrical cube, rather than a vital\r\neconomy,--may be said to be the indications of excellence in a fat ox.\r\nThe points of excellence in such an animal are outlined under the\r\nsubsequent head, as developed in the cutting up after slaughter.\r\n\r\nNow, these qualities are inherent in some breeds; there may be cases and\r\ninstances in all the superior breeds, and in most there may be failures.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIVING AND SLAUGHTERING.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that cattle which have been disposed of to the dealer or\r\nbutcher, or which are intended to be driven to market, should undergo a\r\npreparation for the journey. If they were immediately put to the road to\r\ntravel, from feeding on grass or turnips, when their bowels are full of\r\nundigested vegetable matter, a scouring might ensue which would render\r\nthem unfit to pursue their journey; and this complaint is the more\r\nlikely to be brought on from the strong propensity which cattle have to\r\ntake violent exercise upon feeling themselves at liberty after a long\r\nconfinement. They in fact, become light-headed whenever they leave the\r\nbarn or enclosure, so much so that they actually \"frisk and race and\r\nleap,\" and their antics would be highly amusing, were it not for the\r\napprehension that they may hurt themselves against some opposing object,\r\nas they seem to regard nothing before them.\r\n\r\nOn being let out for the first time, cattle should be put for awhile\r\ninto a larger court, or on a road well fenced with enclosures, and\r\nguarded by men, to romp about. Two or three such allowances of liberty\r\nwill render them quiet; and, in the mean time, to lighten their weight\r\nof carcass, they should have hay for a large proportion of their food.\r\nThese precautions are absolutely necessary for cattle which have been\r\nconfined in barns; otherwise, accidents may befall them on the road,\r\nwhere they will at once break loose. Even at home serious accidents\r\nsometimes overtake them, such as the breaking down of a horn, casting\r\noff a hoof, spraining a tendon, bruising ribs, and heating the whole\r\nbody violently; and, of course, when any such ill luck befalls, the\r\nanimal affected must be left behind, and become a drawback upon the\r\nvalue of the rest, unless kept for some time longer.\r\n\r\nHaving the cattle prepared for travel, the drover takes the road very\r\nslowly for the first two days, not exceeding seven or eight miles a day.\r\nAt night, in winter, they should be put into an open court, and supplied\r\nwith hay, water, and a very few turnips; for, if roots are suddenly\r\nwithdrawn from them,--since it is taken for granted that these have\r\nformed a staple portion of their food,--their bellies will become\r\nshrunken up into smaller dimensions--a state very much against favorable\r\nappearance in market. After the first two days they may proceed faster,\r\nsay twelve or thirteen miles a day, if very fat; and fifteen, if\r\nmoderately so. When the journey is long and the beasts get faint from\r\ntravel, they should have corn to support them. In frosty weather, when\r\nthe roads become very hard, they are apt to become shoulder-shaken, an\r\neffect of founder; and if sleet falls during the day, and becomes frozen\r\nupon them at night, they may become so chilled as to refuse food, and\r\nshrink rapidly away. Cattle should, if possible, arrive the day before\r\nin the neighborhood of a distant market, and be supplied with a good\r\nfeed of roots and hay, or grass, to make them look fresh and fill them\r\nup again; but if the market is at but short distance, they can travel to\r\nit early in the morning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FRONTISPIECE.]\r\n\r\nIn driving cattle the drover should have no dog, which will only annoy\r\nthem. He should walk either before or behind, as he sees them disposed\r\nto proceed too fast or to loiter upon the road; and in passing\r\ncarriages, the leading ox, after a little experience, will make way for\r\nthe rest to follow. On putting oxen on a ferry-boat the shipping of the\r\nfirst one only is attended with much trouble. A man on each side should\r\ntake hold of a horn, or of a halter made of any piece of rope, should\r\nthe beast be hornless, and two other men, one on each side, should push\r\nhim up behind with a piece of rope held between them as a breeching, and\r\nconduct him along the plank into the boat; if it have low gunwales, a\r\nman will be required to remain beside him until one or two more of the\r\ncattle follow their companion, which they will most readily do. From\r\nneglecting this precaution in small ferry-boats, the first beast\r\nsometimes leaps into the water, when it becomes a difficult task to\r\nprevent some of the rest doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nWhatever time a lot of cattle may take to go to a market, they should\r\nnever be _overdriven_. There is great difference of management in this\r\nrespect among drovers. Some like to proceed upon the road quietly,\r\nslowly, but surely, and to reach the market in a placid, cool state.\r\nOthers, again, drive smartly along for some distance, and then rest to\r\ncool awhile, when the beasts will probably get chilled and have a\r\nstaring coat when they reach their destination; while others like to\r\nenter the market with their beasts in an excited state, imagining that\r\nthey then look gay; but distended nostrils, loose bowels, and reeking\r\nbodies are no recommendations to a purchaser. Good judges are shy of\r\npurchasing cattle in a heated state, because they do not know how long\r\nthey may have been in it; and to cover any risk, will give at least five\r\ndollars a head below what they would have offered for them in a cool\r\nstate. Some drovers have a habit of thumping at the hindmost beast of\r\nthe lot with a stick while on the road. This is a censurable practice,\r\nas the flesh, where it is thumped, will bear a red mark after the\r\nanimal has been slaughtered,--the mark receiving the appropriate name of\r\n_blood-burn_--and the flesh thus affected will not take on salt, and is\r\napt to putrefy. A touch up on the shank, or any tendonous part, when\r\ncorrection is necessary, is all that is required; but the voice, in most\r\ncases, will answer as well. The flesh of overdriven cattle, when\r\nslaughtered, never becomes properly firm, and their tallow has a soft,\r\nmelted appearance.\r\n\r\nA few large oxen in one lot look best in a market on a position rather\r\nabove the eye of a spectator. When a large lot is nearly alike in size\r\nand appearance, they look best and most level on a flat piece of ground.\r\nVery large fat oxen never look better than on ground on the same level\r\nwith the spectator. An ox, to look well, should hold his head on a line\r\nwith the body, with lively ears, clear eye, dewy nose, a well-licked\r\nhide, and should stand firmly on the ground on all his feet. These are\r\nall symptoms of high health and good condition. Whenever an ox shifts\r\nhis standing from one foot to another, he is _foot-sore_, and has been\r\ndriven far. Whenever his head hangs down and his eyes water, he feels\r\nill at ease inwardly. When his coat stares, he has been overheated some\r\ntime, and has got a subsequent _chill_. All these latter symptoms will\r\nbe much aggravated in cattle that have been fed in a barn.\r\n\r\nCattle are made to fast before being slaughtered. The time they should\r\nstand depends upon their state on their arrival at the shambles. If they\r\nhave been driven a considerable distance in a proper manner, the bowels\r\nwill be in a tolerably empty state, so that twelve hours may suffice;\r\nbut if they are full and just off their food, twenty-four hours will be\r\nrequired. Beasts that have been overdriven, or much struck with sticks,\r\nor in any degree infuriated, should not be immediately slaughtered, but\r\nallowed to stand on dry food, such as hay, until the symptoms disappear.\r\nThese precautions are absolutely necessary that the meat may be\r\npreserved in the best state.\r\n\r\nThe mode of slaughtering cattle varies in different countries. In the\r\ngreat slaughter-houses at Montmartre, in Paris, they are slaughtered by\r\nbisecting the spinal cord of the cervical vertebræ; and this is\r\naccomplished by the driving of a sharp-pointed chisel between the second\r\nand third vertebræ, with a smart stroke of a mallet, while the animal is\r\nstanding, when it drops, and death or insensibility instantly ensues,\r\nand the blood is let out immediately by opening the blood-vessels of the\r\nneck. The plan adopted in England is, first to bring the ox down on his\r\nknees, and place his under-jaw upon the ground by means of ropes\r\nfastened to his head and passed through an iron ring in the floor of the\r\nslaughterhouse. He is then stunned with a few blows from an iron axe\r\nmade for the purpose, on the forehead, the bone of which is usually\r\ndriven into the brain. The animal then falls upon his side, and the\r\nblood is let out by the neck. Of the two modes, the French is apparently\r\nthe less cruel, for some oxen require many blows to make them fall. Some\r\nbutchers, however, allege that the separation of the spinal cord, by\r\nproducing a general nervous convulsion throughout the body, prevents the\r\nblood from flowing as rapidly and entirely out of it as when the ox is\r\nstunned in the forehead. The skin is then taken off to the knees, when\r\nthe legs are disjointed, and also off the head. The carcass is then\r\nhung up by the tendons of the hough on a stretcher, by a block and\r\ntackle, worked by a small winch, which retains in place what rope it\r\nwinds up by means of a wheel and ratchet.\r\n\r\nAfter the carcass has hung for twenty-four hours, it should be cut down\r\nby the back-bone, or chine, into two _sides_. This is done either with\r\nthe saw, or chopper; the saw making the neatest job in the hands of an\r\ninexperienced butcher, though it is the most laborious; and with the\r\nchopper is the quickest, but by no means the neatest plan, especially in\r\nthe hands of a careless workman. In London, the chine is equally divided\r\nbetween both sides; while in Scotland, one side of a carcass of beef has\r\na great deal more bone than the other, all the spinous processes of the\r\nvertebræ being left upon it. The bony is called the _lying_ side of the\r\nmeat. In London, the divided processes in the fore-quarters are broken\r\nin the middle when warm, and chopped back with the flat side of the\r\nchopper, which has the effect of thickening the fore and middle ribs\r\nconsiderably when cut up. The London butcher also cuts the joints above\r\nthe hind knee, and, by making some incisions with a sharp knife, cuts\r\nthe tendons there, and drops the flesh of the hind-quarter on the flank\r\nand loins, which causes it to cut up thicker than in the Scotch mode. In\r\nopening the hind-quarter he also cuts the aitch bone, or pelvis through\r\nthe centre, which makes the rump look better. Some butchers in the north\r\nof England score the fat of the _closing_ of the hind-quarter, which has\r\nthe effect of making that part of both heifer and ox look like the udder\r\nof an old cow. There is far too much of this scoring practised in\r\nScotland, which prevents the pieces from retaining--which they should,\r\nas nearly as possible--their natural appearance.\r\n\r\nIn cutting up a carcass of beef the London butcher displays great\r\nexpertness; he not only discriminates between the qualities of its\r\ndifferent parts, but can cut out any piece to gratify the taste of his\r\ncustomers. In this way he makes the best use of the carcass and realizes\r\nthe largest value for it, while he gratifies the taste of every grade of\r\ncustomers. A figure of the Scotch and English modes of cutting up a\r\ncarcass of beef will at once show the difference; and upon being\r\ninformed where the valuable pieces lie, an opinion can be formed as to\r\nwhether the oxen the farmer is breeding or feeding possess the\r\nproperties which will enable him to demand the highest price for them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCOTCH MODE OF CUTTING UP BEEF.]\r\n\r\nThe sirloin is the principal roasting-piece, making a very handsome\r\ndish, and is a universal favorite. It consists of two portions, the\r\nScotch and English sides; the former is above the lumbar bones, and is\r\nsomewhat hard in ill-fed cattle; the latter consists of the muscles\r\nunder these bones, which are generally covered with fine fat, and are\r\nexceedingly tender. The better the beast is fed, the larger is the under\r\nmuscle, better covered with fat, and more tender to eat. The hook-bone\r\nand the buttock are cut up for steaks, beefsteak pie, or minced\r\ncollops, and both these, together with the sirloin, bring the highest\r\nprice. The large round and the small round are both well known as\r\nexcellent pieces for salting and boiling, and are eaten cold with great\r\nrelish. The hough is peculiarly suited for boiling down for soup, having\r\na large proportion of gelatinous matter. Brown soup is the principal\r\ndish made of the hough, but its decoction forms an excellent _stock_ for\r\nvarious dishes, and will keep in a state of jelly for a considerable\r\ntime. The thick and the thin flank are both admirable pieces for salting\r\nand boiling. The tail, insignificant as it may seem, makes a soup of a\r\nvery fine flavor. Hotel-keepers have a trick of seasoning brown soup or\r\nrather beef-tea, with a few joints of tail, and passing it off for\r\ngenuine ox-tail soup. These are all the pieces which constitute the\r\nhind-quarter; and it will be seen that they are valuable both for\r\nroasting and boiling, not containing a single coarse piece.\r\n\r\nIn the fore-quarter, is the spare rib, the six ribs of the back end of\r\nwhich make an excellent roast, and when taken from the side opposite to\r\nthe _lying_ one, being free of the bones of the spine, it makes a large\r\none; and it also makes excellent beefsteaks and beefsteak pie. The two\r\nrunners and the nineholes make salting and boiling pieces; but, of\r\nthese, the nineholes is much the best, as it consists of layers of fat\r\nand lean without any bone; whereas the fore parts of the runners have a\r\npiece of shoulder-blade in them, and every piece connected with that\r\nbone is more or less coarse-grained. The brisket eats very well boiled\r\nfresh in broth, and may be cooked and eaten with boiled greens or\r\ncarrots. The shoulder-lyar is a coarse piece, and fit only for boiling\r\nfresh to make into broth or beef-tea. The nap, or shin, is analogous to\r\nthe hough of the hind-leg, but not so rich and fine, there being much\r\nless gelatinous matter in it. The neck makes good broth; and the\r\nsticking-piece is a great favorite with some epicures, on account of the\r\npieces of rich fat in it. It makes an excellent stew, as also sweet\r\nbarley-broth, and the meat eats well when boiled in it.\r\n\r\nThese are all the pieces of the fore-quarter; and it will be seen that\r\nthey consist chiefly of boiling-pieces, and some of them none of the\r\nfinest--the roasting-piece being confined to the six ribs of the spare\r\nrib, and the finest boiling-piece, corned, only to be found in the\r\nnineholes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH MODE OF CUTTING UP BEEF.]\r\n\r\nThe loin is the principal roasting-piece; the rump is the favorite\r\nsteak-piece; the aitch-bone, the favorite stew; the buttock, the thick\r\nflank, and the thin flank are all excellent boiling-pieces when corned;\r\nthe hock and the shin make soup and afford stock for the various\r\nrequirements of the culinary art; and the tail furnishes ox-tail soup--a\r\nfavorite English luncheon. These are all the pieces of the hind-quarter,\r\nand they are valuable of their respective kinds.\r\n\r\nIn the fore-quarter, the fore-rib, middle-rib, and chuckle-rib are all\r\nroasting-pieces, not alike good; but in removing the part of the\r\nshoulder-blade in the middle-rib, the spare-ribs below make a good\r\nbroil or roast; the neck makes soup, being used fresh, boiled; the back\r\nend of the brisket is boiled, corned, or stewed; the leg-of-mutton piece\r\nis coarse, but is as frequently stewed as boiled; the shin is put to the\r\nsame use as the shin and hock of the hind-quarter.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the two modes of cutting-up, it will be observed that in\r\nthe English there are more roasting-pieces than in the Scotch, a large\r\nproportion of the fore-quarter being used in that way. The plan, too, of\r\ncutting the loin between the rump and aitch-bone in the hind-quarter,\r\nlays open the steak-pieces to better advantage than in the Scotch\r\nbullock. Extending the comparison from one part of the carcass to the\r\nother, in both methods, it will be seen that the most valuable\r\npieces--the roasting--occupy its upper, and the less valuable--the\r\nboiling--its lower part. Every beast, therefore, that lays on beef more\r\nupon the upper part of its body is more valuable than one that lays the\r\nsame quantity of flesh on its lower parts.\r\n\r\nIt is deemed unnecessary to enter into details as to the modes of\r\ncutting-up most in vogue in this country, as there is a needlessly great\r\nwant of uniformity.\r\n\r\nOf the qualities of beef obtained from the different breeds of cattle in\r\nEngland, there is no better meat than from the West Highlanders for\r\nfineness of grain and cutting up into convenient pieces for family use.\r\nThe Galloways and Angus, when fattened in English pastures, are great\r\nfavorites in the London market. The Short Horns afford excellent steaks,\r\nbeing thick of flesh, and the slice deep, large and juicy, and their\r\ncovered flanks and nineholes are always thick, juicy, and well-mixed.\r\nThe Herefords are somewhat similar to the Short Horns, and the Devons,\r\nmay, perhaps, be classed among the Galloways and Angus, while the Welsh\r\ncannot be compared to the West Highlanders. Taking, then, the breeds of\r\nScotland as suppliers of good beef, they seem to be more valuable for\r\nthe table than those of England.\r\n\r\nThere are, perhaps, not sufficient data in existence to determine the\r\ntrue proportion of offal of all kinds to the beef of any given fat ox;\r\nbut approximations have been made, which may serve the purpose until the\r\nmatter is investigated by direct experiment, under various\r\ncircumstances. The dead weight bears to the live weight a ratio varying\r\nbetween .571 and .605 to 1; and on applying one or the other multiplier\r\nto the cases of the live weight, a pretty correct approximation is\r\nreached. The tallow is supposed to be eight one-hundredths of the live\r\nweight; so that the multiplier is the decimal .08. The hide is supposed\r\nto be five one-hundredths of the live weight; so to obtain its weight, a\r\nmultiplier, .05, is used. The other offals are supposed to be in a\r\nproportion of about one-fourth of the live weight; so that the\r\nmultiplier, .28, is as near as can be proposed under existing\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nBeef is the staple animal food of this country, and it is used in\r\nvarious states--fresh, salted, smoked, roasted, and boiled. When\r\nintended to be eaten fresh, the _ribs_ will keep the best, and with care\r\nwill keep five or six days in summer, and in winter ten days. The middle\r\nof the _loin_ is the next best, and the _rump_ the next. The _round_\r\nwill not keep long, unless it is salted. The _brisket_ is the worst, and\r\nwill not keep more than three days in summer, and in winter a week.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the power of the stomach to digest beef, that which is\r\neaten boiled with salt only, is digested in two hours and forty-five\r\nminutes. Beef, fresh, lean, and rarely-roasted, and a beefsteak broiled,\r\ntakes three hours to digest; that fresh, and dry-roasted, and boiled,\r\neaten with mustard, is digested in three and a half hours. Lean fresh\r\nbeef fried, requires four hours, and old hard salted beef boiled, does\r\nnot digest in less than four and a quarter hours. Fresh beef-suet boiled\r\ntakes five and a half hours.\r\n\r\nThe usual mode of preserving beef is by salting; and, when intended to\r\nkeep for a long time, such as for the use of shipping, it is always\r\nsalted with brine; but for family use it should be salted only with good\r\nsalt; for brine dispels the juice of meat, and saltpetre only serves to\r\nmake the meat dry, and give it a disagreeable and unnatural red color.\r\nVarious experiments have been made in curing beef with salt otherwise\r\nthan by hand-rubbing, and in a short space of time, and also to preserve\r\nit from putrefaction by other means than salt. Some packers put meat in\r\na copper which is rendered air-tight, and an air-pump then creates a\r\nvacuum within it, thereby extracting all the air out of the meat; then\r\nbrine is pumped in by pressure, which, entering into every pore of the\r\nmeat formerly occupied by the air, is said to place it in a state of\r\npreservation in a few minutes. The carcass of an ox was preserved, in\r\nFrance, for two years from putrefaction by injecting four pounds of\r\nsaline mixture into the carotid artery. Whether any such contrivance can\r\nbe made available for family purposes, seems doubtful.\r\n\r\nCattle, when slaughtered, are useful to man in various other ways than\r\nby affording food from their flesh,--their offal of tallow, hides, and\r\nhorns, forming extensive articles of commerce. Of the _hide_, the\r\ncharacteristics of a good one for strong purposes are strength in its\r\nmiddle, or _butt_, as it called, and lightness in the edges, or _offal_.\r\nA bad hide is the opposite of this--thick in the edges and thin in the\r\nmiddle. A good hide has a firm texture; a bad one, loose and soft. A\r\nhide improves as the summer advances, and it continues to improve after\r\nthe new coat of hair in autumn until November or December, when the coat\r\ngets rough from the coldness of the season, and the hide is then in its\r\nbest state. It is surprising how a hide improves in thickness after the\r\ncold weather has set in. The sort of food does not seem to affect the\r\nquality of the hide; but the better it is, and the better cattle have\r\nbeen fed, and the longer they have been well fed, even from a calf, the\r\nbetter the hide. From what has been said of the effect of weather upon\r\nthe hide, it seems a natural conclusion that a hide is better from an ox\r\nthat has been fed in the open air, than from one that has been kept in\r\nthe barn. Dirt adhering to a hide injures it, particularly in stall-fed\r\nanimals; and any thing that punctures a hide, such as warbles arising\r\nfrom certain insects, is also injurious. The best hides are obtained\r\nfrom the West Highlanders. The Short Horns produce the thinnest hides,\r\nthe Aberdeenshire the next, and then the Angus. Of the same breed, the\r\nox affords the strongest hide; but, as hides are applied to various\r\nuses, the cow's, provided it be large, may be as valuable as that of the\r\nox. The bull's hide is the least valuable. Hides are imported from\r\nRussia and South America.\r\n\r\nHides, when deprived of their hair, are converted into _leather_ by an\r\ninfusion of the astringent property of bark. The old plan of tanning\r\nused to occupy a long time; but, such was the value of the process, that\r\nthe old tanners used to pride themselves upon producing a substantial\r\narticle--which is more than can be said in many instances under modern\r\nimproved modes, which hasten the process, much to the injury of the\r\narticle produced. Strong infusions of bark make leather brittle; one\r\nhundred pounds of skin, quickly tanned in a strong infusion, produce one\r\nhundred and thirty-seven pounds of leather; while a weak infusion\r\nproduces only one hundred and seventeen and a half,--the additional\r\nnineteen and a half pounds serving only to deteriorate the leather, and\r\ncausing it to contain much less textile animal solid. Leather thus\r\nhighly charged with tanning is so spongy as to allow moisture to pass\r\nreadily through its pores, to the great discomfort and injury of those\r\nwho wear shoes made of it. The proper mode of tanning lasts a year, or a\r\nyear and a half, according to the quality of the leather wanted and the\r\nnature of the hides. A perfect leather can be recognized by its section,\r\nwhich should have a glistening marbled appearance, without any white\r\nstreaks in the middle. The hair which is taken off hides in tanning, is\r\nemployed to mix with plaster, and is often surreptitiously put into\r\nhair-mattresses.\r\n\r\nThe principal substances of which _glue_ is made are the\r\nparings of ox and other thick hides, which form the strongest article\r\nand the refuse of the leather-dresser. Both afford from forty-five to\r\nfifty-five per cent. of glue. The tendons, and many other offals of\r\nslaughter-houses, also afford materials, though of an inferior quality,\r\nfor this purpose. The refuse of tanneries--such as the ears of oxen and\r\ncalves--are better articles. Animal skins also, in any form, uncombined\r\nwith tannin, may be worked into glue.\r\n\r\n_Ox-tallow_ is of great importance in the arts. Candles and soap are\r\nmade of it, and it enters largely into the dressing of leather and the\r\nuse of machinery. Large quantities are annually exported from Russia.\r\nOx-tallow consists of seventy-six parts of stearine and twenty-four of\r\noleine, out of one hundred parts.\r\n\r\nThe _horns_ of oxen are used for many purposes. The horn consists of two\r\nparts: an outward horny case, and an inward conical-shaped substance,\r\nsomewhat intermediate between indurated hair and bone, called the\r\n_fluid_ of the horn. These two parts are separated by means of a blow\r\nupon a block of wood. The horny exterior is then cut into three portions\r\nby means of a frame saw. The lowest of these, next the root of the horn,\r\nafter undergoing several processes by which it is rendered flat, is made\r\ninto combs.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the horn, after having been flattened by heat, and its\r\ntransparency improved by oil, is split into thin layers, and forms a\r\nsubstitute for glass in lanterns of the commonest kind. The tip of the\r\nhorns is used by makers of knife-handles and of the tops of whips, and\r\nfor other similar purposes. The interior, or core of the horn, is boiled\r\ndown in water. A large quantity of fat rises to the surface; this is put\r\naside, and sold to the makers of yellow soap. The itself is used as a\r\nkind of glue, and is purchased by the cloth-draper for stiffening. The\r\nbony substance remaining behind is then sent to the mill, and, after\r\nhaving been ground down, is sold to farmers for manure.\r\n\r\nBesides these various purposes to which the different parts of the horn\r\nare applied, the clippings which arise in comb-making are sold to the\r\nfarmer for manure, as well as the shavings which form the refuse of the\r\nlantern-makers. Horn, as is well known, is easily rendered soft and\r\npliant in warm water; and by this peculiarity and its property of\r\nadhering like glue, large plates of horn can be made by cementing\r\ntogether the edges of small pieces rendered flat by a peculiar process,\r\nas a substitute for glass. Imitation of tortoise-shell can be given to\r\nhorn by means of various metallic solutions. Horn, also, when softened,\r\ncan be imprinted with any pattern, by means of dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDiseases and their Remedies\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this head it is proposed to notice such diseases as are most\r\ncommon among cattle, together with their symptoms, and to suggest such\r\ntreatment of the same as has been found in the practice of the author,\r\nin the main, effective. He is aware that much more space might have been\r\nappropriated to this head, as has been the case in other treatises of\r\nthis class; but he doubts the propriety of multiplying words about\r\ndiseases which are of very rare occurrence, deeming it more fitting to\r\nleave such instances exclusively to the intelligent consideration of the\r\nreliable veterinary practitioner.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of reference, the diseases here noticed have been\r\narranged in alphabetical order; the whole concluding with information as\r\nto two or three operations which cannot be uninteresting to, or\r\nunprofitable for, the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nABORTION.\r\n\r\nThe cow is, more than any other animal, subject to abortion, or\r\nslinking, which takes place at different periods of pregnancy, from half\r\nof the usual time to the seventh, or almost to the eighth month. The\r\nsymptoms of the approach of abortion, unless the breeder is very much\r\namong his stock, are not often perceived; or, if perceived, they are\r\nconcealed by the person in charge, lest he should be accused of neglect\r\nor improper treatment.\r\n\r\nThe cow is somewhat off her feed--rumination ceases--she is listless and\r\ndull--the milk diminishes or dries up--the motions of the foetus\r\nbecome more feeble, and at length cease altogether--there is a slight\r\ndegree of enlargement of the belly--there is a little staggering in her\r\nwalk--when she is down she lies longer than usual, and when she gets up\r\nshe stands for a longer time motionless.\r\n\r\nAs the abortion approaches, a yellow or red glairy fluid runs from the\r\nvagina (this is a symptom, which rarely, or never, deceives) her\r\nbreathing becomes laborious and slightly convulsive. The belly has for\r\nseveral days lost its natural rotundity, and has been evidently\r\nfalling,--she begins to moan,--the pulse becomes small, wiry, and\r\nintermittent. At length labor comes on, and is often attended with much\r\ndifficulty and danger.\r\n\r\nIf the abortion has been caused by blows or violence, whether from\r\nbrutality, or the animal's having been teased by other cows in season,\r\nor by oxen, the symptoms are more intense. The animal suddenly ceases to\r\neat and to ruminate--is uneasy, paws the ground, rests her head on the\r\nmanger while she is standing, and on her flank when she is lying\r\ndown--hemorrhage frequently comes on from the uterus, or when this is\r\nnot the case the mouth of that organ is spasmodically contracted. The\r\nthroes come on, are distressingly violent, and continue until the womb\r\nis ruptured. If all these circumstances be not observed, still the labor\r\nis protracted and dangerous.\r\n\r\nAbortion is sometimes singularly frequent in particular districts, or on\r\nparticular farms, appearing to assume an epizoötic or epidemic form.\r\nThis has been accounted for in various ways. Some have imagined it to be\r\ncontagious. It is, indeed, destructively propagated among the cows, but\r\nthis is probably to be explained on a different principle from that of\r\ncontagion. The cow is a considerably imaginative animal, and highly\r\nirritable during the period of pregnancy. In abortion, the foetus is\r\noften putrid before it is discharged; and the placenta, or after-birth,\r\nrarely or never follows it, but becomes decomposed, and, as it drops\r\naway in fragments, emits a peculiar and most noisome smell. This smell\r\nseems to be peculiarly annoying to the other cows: they sniff at it and\r\nthen run bellowing about. Some sympathetic influence is exercised on\r\ntheir uterine organs, and in a few days a greater or less number of\r\nthose that had pastured together likewise abort. Hence arises the\r\nrapidity with which the foetus is usually taken away and buried\r\ndeeply, and far from the cows; and hence the more effectual preventive\r\nof smearing the parts of the cow with tar or stinking oils, in order to\r\nconceal or subdue the smell; and hence, too, the inefficacy, as a\r\npreventive, of removing her to a far-distant pasture.\r\n\r\nThe pastures on which the blood or inflammatory fever is most prevalent\r\nare those on which the cows oftenest slink their calves. Whatever can\r\nbecome a source of general excitation and fever is likely, during\r\npregnancy, to produce inflammation of the womb; or whatever would, under\r\nother circumstances, excite inflammation of almost any organ, has at\r\nthat time its injurious effect determined to this particular one.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer is aware of the injurious effect of the coarse, rank\r\nherbage of low, marshy, and woody countries, and he regards these\r\ndistricts as the chosen residence of red water; it may be added, that\r\nthey are also the chosen residence of abortion. Hard and mineral waters\r\nare justly considered as laying the foundation of many diseases among\r\ncattle, and of abortion among the rest.\r\n\r\nSome careful observers have occasionally attributed abortion to\r\ndisproportion in size between the male and the female. Farmers were\r\nformerly too fond of selecting a great overgrown bull to serve their\r\ndairy or breeding cows, and many a heifer, or little cow, was seriously\r\ninjured; and she either cast her calf, or was lost in parturition. The\r\nbreeders of cattle in later years are beginning to act more wisely in\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\nCows that are degenerating into consumption are exceedingly subject to\r\nabortion. They are continually in heat; they rarely become pregnant, or\r\nif they do, a great proportion of them cast their calves. Abortion,\r\nalso, often follows a sudden change from poor to luxuriant food. Cows\r\nthat have been out, half-starved in the winter, when incautiously turned\r\non rich pasture in the spring, are too apt to cast their calves from the\r\nundue general or local excitation that is set up. Hence it is, that when\r\nthis disposition to abort first appears in a herd, it is naturally in a\r\ncow that has been lately purchased. Fright, from whatever cause, may\r\nproduce this trouble. There are singular cases on record of whole herds\r\nof cows slinking their calves after having been terrified by an\r\nunusually violent thunder-storm. Commerce with the bull soon after\r\nconception is also a frequent cause, as well as putrid smells--other\r\nthan those already noticed--and the use of a diseased bull. Besides\r\nthese tangible causes of abortion, there is the mysterious agency of the\r\natmosphere. There are certain seasons when abortion is strangely\r\nfrequent, and fatal; while at other times it disappears in a manner for\r\nseveral successive years.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of premature calving are frequently of a very serious\r\nnature; and even when the case is more favorable, the results are,\r\nnevertheless, very annoying. The animal very soon goes again to heat,\r\nbut in a great many cases she fails to become pregnant; she almost\r\ninvariably does so, if she is put to the bull during the first heat\r\nafter abortion. If she should come in calf again during that season, it\r\nis very probable that at about the same period of gestation, or a little\r\nlater, she will again abort: or that when she becomes in calf the\r\nfollowing year, the same fatality will attend her. Some say that this\r\ndisposition to cast her young gradually ceases; that if she does\r\nmiscarry, it is at a later and still later period of pregnancy; and\r\nthat, in about three or four years, she may be depended upon as a\r\ntolerably safe breeder. He, however, would be sadly inattentive to his\r\nown interests who keeps a profitless beast so long.\r\n\r\nThe calf very rarely lives, and in the majority of cases it is born dead\r\nor putrid. If there should appear to be any chance of saving it, it\r\nshould be washed with warm water, carefully dried, and fed frequently\r\nwith small quantities of new milk, mixed, according to the apparent\r\nweakness of the animal, either with raw eggs or good gruel; while the\r\nbowels should, if occasion requires, be opened by means of small doses\r\nof castor-oil. If any considerable period is to elapse before the\r\nnatural time of pregnancy would have expired, it will usually be\r\nnecessary to bring up the little animal entirely by hand.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of abortion differs but little from that of parturition.\r\nIf the farmer has once been tormented by this pest in his dairy, he\r\nshould carefully watch the approaching symptoms of casting the calf, and\r\nas soon as he perceives them, should remove the animal from the pasture\r\nto a comfortable cow-house or shed. If the discharge be glairy, but not\r\noffensive, he may hope that the calf is not dead; he will be assured of\r\nthis by the motion of the foetus, and then it is possible that the\r\nabortion may still be avoided. He should hasten to bleed her, and that\r\ncopiously, in proportion to her age, size, condition, and the state of\r\nexcitation in which he may find her; and he should give a dose of physic\r\nimmediately after the bleeding. When the physic begins to operate, he\r\nshould administer half a drachm of opium and half an ounce of sweet\r\nspirits of nitre. Unless she is in a state of great debility, he should\r\nallow nothing but gruel, and she should be kept as quiet as possible.\r\nBy these means he may occasionally allay the general or local irritation\r\nthat precedes or causes the abortion, and the cow may yet go to her full\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nShould, however, the discharge be fetid, the conclusion will be that the\r\nfoetus is dead, and must be got rid of, and that as speedily as\r\npossible. Bleeding may even then be requisite if much fever exists; or,\r\nperhaps, if there is debility, some stimulating drink may not be out of\r\nplace. In other respects the animal must be treated as if her usual time\r\nof pregnancy had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nMuch may be done in the way of preventing this habit of abortion among\r\ncows. _The foetus must be got rid of immediately._ It should be buried\r\ndeep, and far from the cow-pasture. Proper means should be taken to\r\nhasten the expulsion of the placenta. A dose of physic should be given;\r\nergot of rye administered; the hand should be introduced, and an effort\r\nmade, cautiously and gently, to detach the placenta; all violence,\r\nhowever, should be carefully avoided; for considerable and fatal\r\nhemorrhage may be speedily produced. The parts of the cow should be well\r\nwashed with a solution of the chloride of lime, which should be injected\r\nup the vagina, and also given internally. In the mean time, and\r\nespecially after the expulsion of the placenta, the cow-house should be\r\nwell washed with the same solution.\r\n\r\nThe cow, when beginning to recover, should be fattened and sold. This is\r\nthe first and the grand step toward the prevention of abortion, and he\r\nis unwise who does not immediately adopt it. All other means are\r\ncomparatively inefficient and worthless. Should the owner be reluctant\r\nto part with her, two months, at least, should pass before she is\r\npermitted to return to her companions. Prudence would probably dictate\r\nthat she should never return to them, but be kept, if possible, on some\r\ndistant part of the farm.\r\n\r\nAbortion having once occurred among the herd, the breeding cows should\r\nbe carefully watched. Although they should be well fed, they should not\r\nbe suffered to get into too high condition. Unless they are decidedly\r\npoor and weak, they should be bled between the third and fourth months\r\nof pregnancy, and a mild dose of physic administered to each. If the\r\npest continues to reappear, the owner should most carefully examine how\r\nfar any of the causes of abortion that have been detected, may exist on\r\nhis farm, and exert himself to thoroughly remove them.\r\n\r\nAn interesting paper upon this subject may be found in the Veterinary\r\nReview, vol. 1., p. 434, communicated by Prof. Henry Tanner, of Queen's\r\nCollege, Birmingham, England. As it suggests a theory as to the origin\r\nof this disease which is, to say the least, quite plausible, we transfer\r\nthe article:--\r\n\r\n\"I shall not go into any notice of the general subject of abortion, but\r\nrather restrict my remarks to a cause which is very much overlooked, and\r\nyet which is probably more influential than all other causes combined. I\r\nrefer to the growth of ergotized grass-seeds in our pastures.\r\n\r\n\"The action of ergot of rye (_secale cornutum_) upon the womb is well\r\nknown as an excitant to powerful action, which usually terminates in the\r\nexpulsion of the foetus. We have a similar disease appearing on the\r\nseeds of our grasses, but especially on the rye grass, and thus we have\r\nan ergot of the seeds of rye grass produced, possessing similar exciting\r\npowers upon the womb to those produced by the ergot of rye.\r\n\r\n\"Two conditions are necessary for the production of this ergot upon the\r\nseed of rye grass. The first is, the grass must be allowed to run to\r\nseed; and the second is, that the climate must be favorable for\r\nencouraging the development of the ergot.\r\n\r\n\"In practice, we find that on land which has been fed on during the\r\nsummer, unless it has been grazed with unusual care, much of the grass\r\nthrows up seed-stalks and produces seed. In districts where the climate\r\nis humid and rain abundant, as well as in very wet seasons, these seeds\r\nbecome liable to the growth of this ergot. Cattle appear to eat it with\r\na relish, and the result is that abortion spreads rapidly through the\r\nherd. Heifers and cows, which, up to the appearance of the ergot, have\r\nheld in calf, are excited to cast their calves by consuming it in their\r\nfood. The abortion having once commenced, we know that the peculiarly\r\nsensitive condition of the breeding animal will cause its extension,\r\neven where the original cause may not be in operation; but their\r\ncombined action renders the loss far more serious. If we add to this the\r\ntendency which an animal receives from her first abortion, to repeat it\r\nwhen next in calf, we see how seriously the mischief becomes multiplied.\r\n\r\n\"A somewhat extended observation, added to my own experience, has led me\r\nto the conviction that very much of the loss arising from abortion in\r\nour cows may be traced to the cause I have named. I feel assured the\r\ninfluence is even more extended than I have stated; for not only would\r\nthe foetus be thrown off in its advanced stage, but also in its\r\nearlier growth, thus causing great trouble to breeders of high-bred\r\nstock, the repeated turning of cows to the bull, and at most irregular\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n\"The remedy differs in no respect from the ordinary mode of treatment,\r\nexcept that it compels a removal of the stock from the influence of the\r\ncause. Much, however, may be done by way of prevention; and this I shall\r\nbriefly notice.\r\n\r\n\"It simply consists in keeping breeding cows and heifers upon land free\r\nfrom these seeds. Grass which has been grazed during the summer, will\r\nvery generally, in a humid climate, have some of this ergotized seed;\r\nbut I have not observed it produced before the end of July, or early in\r\nAugust; and I doubt its existence, to any injurious degree, up to this\r\ntime. We may, therefore, consider such ground safe up to this period. If\r\nthe breeding stock are then removed to grass land which, having been\r\nmown for this operation is a guaranty against any seeds remaining, it\r\nwill seldom, if ever, happen that any injury will result from the\r\nproduction of ergotized grass later in the season.\r\n\r\n\"I will not venture to say that such will not appear in some cases where\r\nthe grass has been cut early and has been followed by a rapid growth;\r\nbut, at any rate, we have grazing land free from this excitant from July\r\nuntil September; and in the grass which has been mown late, I do not\r\nconsider that there is the least fear of ergot's being again formed in\r\nthat season. In this manner a farmer may keep grass land for his\r\nbreeding stock entirely free from ergotized grass; and, consequently, so\r\nfar as this cause is concerned, they will be free from abortion. How far\r\nyoung heifers may be prejudicially influenced, before they are used for\r\nbreeding, by an excitement of the womb, appears to me to be a subject\r\nworthy of some attention on the part of the veterinary profession.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOPLEXY.\r\n\r\nThis is a determination of blood to the head, causing pressure upon the\r\nbrain. Animals attacked with this disease are generally in a plethoric\r\ncondition. The usual symptoms are _coma_ (a sleepy state), eyes\r\nprotruding, respiration accelerated; finally, the animal falls,\r\nstruggles, and dies.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, bleeding should be resorted to at an early period; give\r\nin drink one pound of Epsom-salts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK WATER.\r\n\r\nThis is simply an exaggerated stage of the disease known as Red\r\nWater,--to which the reader is referred in its appropriate place,--the\r\nurine being darker in color in consequence of the admixture of venous\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are similar, though more acute. There is constipation at\r\nfirst, which is followed by diarrhoea, large quantities of blood\r\npassing away with the evacuations from the bowels; symptoms of abdominal\r\npain are present; the loins become extremely tender; and the animal dies\r\nin a greatly prostrated condition.\r\n\r\nThe treatment does not differ from that prescribed in case of Red\r\nWater.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\nThe trachea and bronchial tubes are frequently the seat of inflammation,\r\nespecially in the spring of the year,--the symptoms of which are often\r\nconfounded with those of other pulmonary diseases. This inflammation is\r\nfrequently preceded by catarrhal affections; cough is often present for\r\na long time before the more acute symptoms are observed. Bronchitis\r\noccasionally makes its appearance in an epizoötic form.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A peculiarly anxious expression of the countenance will be\r\nobserved; respiration laborious; a husky, wheezing, painful cough; on\r\nplacing the ear to the windpipe a sonorous _râle_ is heard; symptomatic\r\nfever also prevails to a greater or less extent.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Counter-irritation should be early resorted to; strong\r\nmustard, mixed with equal parts of spirits of hartshorn and water, and\r\nmade into a thin paste, should be applied all along the neck, over the\r\nwindpipe, and to the sides, and should be well rubbed in; or, the\r\ntincture of cantharides, with ten drops of castor-oil to each ounce,\r\napplied in the same manner as the former, will be found equally\r\neffective. Give internally ten drops of Fleming's tincture of aconite\r\nevery four hours, until five or six doses have been given; after which\r\ngive one of the following powders twice a day: nitrate of potash, one\r\nounce; Barbadoes aloes, one ounce; Jamaica ginger, half an ounce;\r\npulverized-gentian root, one ounce; mix and divide into eight powders.\r\nIf necessary a pound of salts may be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION\r\n\r\nThis affection--technically known as _phthisis pulmonalis_--is the\r\ntermination of chronic disease of the lungs. These organs become filled\r\nwith many little cysts, or sacks, containing a yellowish or\r\nyellowish-white fluid, which in time is hardened, producing a condition\r\nof the lungs known as tuberculous. These tubercles in turn undergo\r\nanother change, becoming soft in the centre and gradually involving the\r\nwhole of the hardened parts, which, uniting with adjoining ones, soon\r\nforms cysts of considerable size. These cysts are known as abscesses.\r\n\r\nNo treatment will be of much service here. It is, therefore, better, if\r\nthe animal is not too poor in flesh, to have it slaughtered.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORYZA\r\n\r\nIn the spring, and late in the fall, catarrhal affections are quite\r\ncommon, occurring frequently in a epizoötic form. Coryza, or nasal\r\ncatarrh,--commonly called a cold in the head,--is not very common among\r\ncows. As its name implies, it is a local disease, confined to the lining\r\nmembrane of the nose; and, consequently, the general system is not\r\nusually disturbed.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animal will be observed to sneeze; the Schneiderian\r\nmembrane (membrane of the nose) is heightened in color; cough sometimes\r\naccompanies; there is also a muco-purulent discharge from the nose.\r\nNeglect to attend to these early symptoms frequently occasions disease\r\nof a more serious nature; in fact, coryza may be regarded as the\r\nforerunner of all epizoötic pulmonary disorders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHAT ON THE ROAD.]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal should be kept on a low diet for a few days;\r\nthe nostrils occasionally steamed, and one of the following powders\r\ngiven night and morning, which, in most cases, will be all the medicine\r\nrequired: nitrate of potassa, one ounce; digitalis leaves pulverized and\r\ntartrate of antimony, of each one drachm; sulphate of copper, two\r\ndrachms; mix, and divide into eight powders. Should the disease prove\r\nobstinate, give for two or three days two ounces of Epsom-salts at a\r\ndose, dissolved in water, three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOW-POX.\r\n\r\nTwo varieties of sore teats occur in the cow, in the form of pustular\r\neruptions. They first appear as small vesicles containing a purulent\r\nmatter, and subsequently assume a scabby appearance, or small ulcers\r\nremain, which often prove troublesome to heal. This latter is the\r\ncow-pox, from which Jenner derived the vaccine matter.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Foment the teats well with warm water and Castile-soap;\r\nafter which, wipe the bag dry, and dress with citrine ointment. The\r\npreparations of iodine have also been recommended, and they are very\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA.\r\n\r\nCattle are frequently subject to this disease, particularly in the\r\nspring of the year when the grass is young and soft. Occasionally it\r\nassumes a very obstinate form in consequence of the imperfect secretion\r\nof gastric juice; the _fæces_ are thin, watery, and fetid, followed by\r\nvery great prostration of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of diarrhoea are too well known to require any detailed\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If in a mild form, the diet should be low; give two ounces\r\nof Epsom-salts, twice a day. In a more obstinate form, give two drachms\r\nof carbonate of soda in the food. Oak-bark tea will be found very useful\r\nin these cases; or one of the following powders, twice a day, will be\r\nfound very advantageous: pulverized opium and catechu, each one and a\r\nhalf ounces; prepared chalk, one drachm; to be given in the feed.\r\n\r\nCalves are particularly subject to this disease, and it often proves\r\nfatal to them. It sometimes assumes an epizoötic form, when it is\r\ngenerally of a mild character. So long as the calf is lively and feeds\r\nwell, the farmer should entertain no fear for him; but if he mopes\r\nabout, refuses his food, ceases to ruminate, wastes in flesh, passes\r\nmucus and blood with the _fæces_, and exhibits symptoms of pain, the\r\ncase is a dangerous one.\r\n\r\nIn such an emergency, lose no time, but give two or three ounces of\r\nCastor-oil with flour-gruel, or two ounces of salts at a dose, followed\r\nwith small draughts of oak-bark tea; or give, twice a day, one of the\r\nfollowing powders: pulverized catechu, opium, and Jamaca ginger, of each\r\nhalf an ounce; prepared chalk, one ounce; mix, and divide into twelve\r\npowders. Bran washes, green food, and flour-gruel should be given, with\r\nplenty of salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSENTERY\r\n\r\nThis disease is very frequently confounded with the foregoing. A\r\ndistinction, however, exists,--since inflammation appears in this\r\ndisease, while it is absent in the former. In this affection,\r\ninflammation of the large intestines takes place, which is attended with\r\ndiarrhoea. The _fæces_ are covered with blood; the animal rapidly\r\nbecomes prostrated, and death frequently comes to his relief.\r\n\r\nYouatt says: \"It is, however, with dysentery that the practitioner is\r\nmost loth to cope,--a disease that betrays thousands of cattle. This,\r\nalso, may be either acute or chronic. Its causes are too often buried in\r\nobscurity, and its premonitory symptoms are disregarded or unknown.\r\nThere appears to be a strong predisposition in cattle to take on this\r\ndisease. It seems to be the winding-up of many serious complaints, and\r\nthe foundation of it is sometimes laid by those that appear to be of the\r\nmost trifling nature. It is that in cattle which glanders and farcy are\r\nin the horse,--the breaking up of the constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Dysentery may be a symptom and concomitant of other diseases. It is one\r\nof the most fearful characteristics of murrain; it is the destructive\r\naccompaniment, or consequence, of phthisis. It is produced by the sudden\r\ndisappearance of a cutaneous eruption; it follows the cessation of\r\nchronic hoose; it is the consequence of the natural or artificial\r\nsuspension of every secretion. Were any secretion to be particularly\r\nselected, the repression of which would produce dysentery, it would be\r\nthat of the milk. How often does the farmer observe that no sooner does\r\na milch cow cease her usual supply of milk than she begins to purge!\r\nThere may not appear to be any thing else the matter with her; but she\r\npurges, and, in the majority of cases, that purging is fatal.\r\n\r\n\"It may, sometimes, however, be traced to sufficient causes, exclusive\r\nof previous disease. Unwholesome food--exposure to cold--neglect at\r\nthe time of calving--low and marshy situations--the feeding in meadows\r\nthat have been flooded, where it is peculiarly fatal--the grazing\r\n(according to Mr. Leigh, and our experience confirms his statement) upon\r\nthe clays lying over the blue lias rock--the neighborhood of woods and\r\nof half-stagnant rivers--the continuation of unusually sultry\r\nweather--overwork, and all the causes of acute dysentery, may produce\r\nthat of a chronic nature; an acute dysentery--neglected, or badly, or\r\neven most skillfully treated--may degenerate into an incurable chronic\r\naffection. Half starve a cow, or over-feed her, milk her to exhaustion,\r\nor dry her milk too rapidly--and dysentery may follow.\r\n\r\n\"The following will, probably, be the order of the symptoms, if they are\r\ncarefully observed: There will be a little dullness or anxiety of\r\ncountenance, the muzzle becoming short or contracted; a slight shrinking\r\nwhen the loins are pressed upon; the skin a little harsh and dry; the\r\nhair a little rough; there will be a slight degree of uneasiness and\r\nshivering that scarcely attracts attention; then--except it be the\r\ndegeneracy of acute into chronic dysentery--constipation may be\r\nperceived. It will be to a certain extent, obstinate; the excrement will\r\nvoided with pain; it will be dry, hard, and expelled in small\r\nquantities. In other cases, perhaps, purging will be present from the\r\nbeginning; the animal will be tormented with _tenesmus_, or frequent\r\ndesire to void its excrement, and that act attended by straining and\r\npain, by soreness about the _anus_, and protrusion of the _rectum_, and\r\nsometimes by severe colicky spasms. In many cases, however, and in those\r\nof a chronic form, few of these distressing symptoms are observed, even\r\nat the commencement of the disease; but the animal voids her _fæces_\r\noftener than it is natural that she should, and they are more fluid than\r\nin a state of health; while at the same time she loses her appetite and\r\nspirits and condition, and is evidently wasting away.\"\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give one drachm of the extract of belladonna, three times\r\na day, dissolved in water; or calomel and powdered opium, of each one\r\ndrachm three times daily. As soon as the inflammatory stage passes by,\r\ngive one of the following three times daily, in their gruel: nitrate of\r\npotash pulverized, gentian-root pulverized, of each one ounce;\r\npulverized Jamaica ginger, one half an ounce; pulverized caraway, or\r\nanise-seed, six drachms. A bottle of porter given once or twice a day,\r\nwill be found of very great advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nENTERITIS.\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammation of the external or internal coat of the\r\nintestines, sometimes attended with violent purging, especially when it\r\nis confined to the internal coats. Oxen in good condition are more\r\nsubject to this disease than are cows. It most frequently occurs in dry,\r\nhot weather. It is sudden in its attacks, and often fatal in its\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animal is dull, and not disposed to move about; the\r\nmuzzle is dry, and the coat staring; the animal yields, on pressure of\r\nthe _loins_; a weak, staggering gait, when forced to move; respiration\r\nhurried; pulse accelerated but small; eyes red, full and fiery; head\r\nprotruding; mouth, ears, and horns hot; appetite bad; rumination ceases;\r\nthe bowels become constipated; the animal moans continually, and froths\r\nat the mouth. These symptoms violently increase as the disease advances.\r\nThe animal becomes more depressed and feeble, grinds his teeth, and\r\nappears half unconscious, and dies in convulsions.\r\n\r\nOf the causes of this disease, Youatt, who is almost the only authority\r\nwe have upon this subject, says: \"It seems occasionally to be epidemic;\r\nfor several instances of it occur, of the same character, and in the\r\nsame district. M. Cruzel gives an illustration of this in his\r\ndescription of the disease that destroyed so many cattle, in the years\r\n1826 to 1827, in the Department _de la Nievre_. Out of two hundred and\r\neighteen cattle belonging to three farmers, one hundred and thirteen\r\nwere attacked by this disease, and eighty-three of them died. One farmer\r\nin a neighboring district had nineteen head of cattle, all of which\r\nsickened, but only three were lost. These were unusually hot summers.\r\nThe upland pasture was burnt up, or what remained of it was rendered\r\nunusually stimulating; and the acrid plants of the marshes and low\r\ngrounds acquired additional deleterious agency.\r\n\r\n\"When isolated cases occur, they may generally be attributed to\r\nmismanagement. Exposure to cold, or the drinking of cold water when\r\noverheated with work; too hard work in sultry weather; the use of water\r\nstagnant, impure, or containing any considerable quantity of metallic\r\nsalts; the sudden revulsion of some cutaneous eruption; the crowding of\r\nanimals into a confined place; too luxuriant and stimulating food\r\ngenerally; and the mildewed and unwholesome food on which cattle are too\r\noften kept, are fruitful sources of this complaint.\"\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In the early stage of the disease, give an active purge,\r\nand follow it with ten drops of Fleming's tincture of aconite, four\r\ntimes daily, for two days; then give drachm doses of the extract of\r\nbelladonna; give no food for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, according\r\nto circumstances. Bleeding, if done early, is often beneficial.\r\nCounter-irritants to the belly are also recommended; the best are\r\nmustard, hartshorn, and water, mixed together--or tincture of\r\ncantharides, with one drachm of croton-oil added to every ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIZOÖTICS.\r\n\r\nDiseases of this class have the same relation to the inferior animals\r\nthat epidemic diseases have to man. Of course, they assume a very\r\npestilential character. Scarcely a year passes away without diseases of\r\nthis nature making their appearance in some parts of the world. They\r\noccur at all seasons of the year, but more generally prevail in the\r\nspring and fall. The period of their duration varies from months to\r\nyears. They are, at times, mild in their attacks, and yield readily to\r\nproper treatment; at other times, they become painful pestilences,\r\ndestroying every thing in their course.\r\n\r\nThe causes are generally sought for in some peculiar condition of the\r\natmosphere. The use of the milk and flesh of diseased cattle has\r\nfrequently been productive of malignant diseases in the human family.\r\n\r\nSilius Italicus describes a fearful epizoötic, which first attacked the\r\ndog, then the feathered biped, then horses, and cattle, and, last of\r\nall, the human being.\r\n\r\n     \"On mules and dogs the infection first began,\r\n     And, last, the vengeful arrows fixed in man.\"\r\n\r\nEpizoötics, occurring in rats, cats, dogs, horses, and cattle, which\r\nwere followed in the succeeding years by more fearful ones which\r\nattacked the human family, are numerously recorded. These scourges have\r\nappeared in all ages of the world; but, as time and space will not allow\r\nour entering upon an extended consideration of them,--however\r\ninteresting they might be to the general reader,--we shall content\r\nourselves by quoting, somewhat in brief, from the lectures of the late\r\nWilliam Youatt on these fatal maladies:--\r\n\r\n\"In the year 801, and at the commencement of the reign of Charlemagne,\r\nan epidemic disease devastated a great portion of his dominions. This\r\nwas attributed to the villainy of the Duke of Benevento, who was said to\r\nhave employed a great many persons in scattering an enchanted powder\r\nover the fields, which destroyed both the cattle and the food of the\r\ncattle. M. Paulet seems inclined to give full credence to this, and says\r\nthat history offers many proofs of this destructive and diabolical\r\npractice. He affirms that many persons were punished in Germany,\r\nFrance, and, particularly, at Toulouse, for the commission of this\r\ncrime. Several of the suspected agents of these atrocities were put to\r\nthe torture and made full confession of their crime.\r\n\r\n\"Of the occurrence of these diseases from the year 800 to 1316,--an\r\ninterval of mental darkness, and of horrors and calamities of every\r\nkind,--history records twenty cases, more or less destructive, and\r\nextending, with greater or less devastation, over France and Germany,\r\nItaly and England. Of these twenty, four date their origin from an\r\nexcessive moisture in the air, accompanied by almost continual rains,\r\nand flooding the country to a considerable extent. One was supposed to\r\nbe the consequence of long-continued drought and excessive heat; one was\r\ntraced to the influence of an eclipse of the sun; another, to a comet;\r\nand a fourth, to a most unusually stormy winter. The reader will have\r\nthe kindness to remember that we are here expressing the opinions of the\r\nwriters of the day, and by no means, our own belief of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Of the four which trace their origin to extreme wet and its\r\nconsequences, the first occurred in France, in 820, after a long\r\ncontinuance of rain; and it was equally fatal to men and cattle. The\r\nsecond, which was equally fatal to both, appeared in Lorraine, in 889.\r\nThe third broke out among the cavalry of the army of Arnoul, in its\r\npassage over the Alps, on its return to Italy. The fourth pervaded the\r\nwhole of England in 1125, and was equally fatal to the biped and the\r\nquadruped.\r\n\r\n\"That which followed excessive heat and drought, was generally prevalent\r\nthroughout Europe, but especially so in Germany. It attacked oxen,\r\nsheep, and pigs. It appeared in 994, and lasted six months.\r\n\r\n\"The one which was attributed to the comet, and which principally\r\nattacked cattle, appeared in France in 943 Almost every animal perished.\r\n\r\n\"Another, that was supposed to be connected with an eclipse of the sun,\r\nwas prevalent throughout the greater part of Germany, among men and\r\nanimals, in 989.\r\n\r\n\"The disease, which was the consequence of a cold and boisterous winter,\r\nwas principally prevalent in France, in 887, and committed sad ravages\r\namong the herds of cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\n\"Of the twelve others, of which, authors do not indicate the cause, the\r\nfirst was in France, in 810, and principally among cattle. The second\r\nwas also in France, in 850, and almost depopulated the country of\r\ncattle. The third, in 868, was common to all animals in France. The\r\nfourth, in 870, was in the same country, and caused severe loss among\r\ncattle. The fifth prevailed on the Rhine and in Germany, and destroyed\r\nan almost incalculable number of cattle. The sixth attacked the horses\r\nof the army of Arnoul in Lorraine, in 888. The seventh, in 940,\r\ndestroyed a vast number of cattle in France, Italy, and Germany. The\r\neighth and ninth were in France, in 941 and 942, and almost all the\r\ncattle in the country perished. The tenth pestilence broke out in\r\nEngland, in the year 1041, and frightful was its devastation among all\r\nanimals, and, particularly, horned cattle. The eleventh also devastated\r\nour country, in 1103, and the ravages were dreadful. The twelfth was\r\nchiefly fatal in Germany, and particularly in Gueldres, in 1149.\r\n\r\n\"These twenty pestilences occurred in the space of 506 years. Five or\r\nsix of them were most prevalent among cattle; two were almost confined\r\nto horses; twelve included, to a greater or less degree, almost every\r\nspecies of quadrupeds; and four extended to the human being. Among these\r\nthe ravages of eight were most destructive in France; as many in\r\nGermany; and four in Italy and England.\r\n\r\n\"As far as we have hitherto proceeded, it will also appear that cattle\r\nare more subject to these diseases than any other species of\r\ndomesticated animals, and that the pestilence is always most fearful\r\namong them. It is also evident that the maladies which proceed from cold\r\nor humidity are more frequent in the temperate and southern parts of\r\nEurope than those which depend upon drought, or almost any other cause.\r\n\r\n\"The malady lingers in different countries, in proportion to its want of\r\npower to accomplish at once all its devastation.\r\n\r\n\"After this time, there are few satisfactory accounts of these diseases\r\nfor more than five centuries. We only know that, occasionally suspending\r\ntheir ravages,--or, rather, visiting new districts when they had ceased\r\nto desolate others--they have continued to be objects of terror and\r\ninstruments of devastation, even unto the present day; and it is only\r\nwithin a few years that they have been really understood, and have\r\nbecome, to a certain degree, manageable.\"\r\n\r\nIn the United States, epizoötic diseases have been of frequent\r\noccurrence; but, owing to the want of properly qualified veterinary\r\nsurgeons, they have not, until within a very recent period, been\r\nproperly described or understood. The day however, is fast approaching\r\nwhen this void will be filled, and when epizoötic and other diseases\r\nwill be correctly noted and recorded. The necessity for this must have\r\nbeen forcibly impressed upon the minds of the inhabitants of our country\r\nfrom the experience of the last ten or twelve years.\r\n\r\nRespecting the late epizoötic among cattle in Portage County, Ohio,\r\nWilliam Pierce, V.S., of Ravenna, thus describes the symptoms as they\r\nappeared, in a letter to the author: \"A highly-colored appearance of the\r\nsclerotic coat of the eye, also of the _conjunctiva_ (a lining membrane\r\nof the eyelid) and the Schneiderian membrane of the nose; a high animal\r\nheat about the head and horns; a highly inflammatory condition of the\r\nblood; contraction of all the abdominal viscera; hurried respiration;\r\ngreat prostration and nervous debility; lameness; followed by gangrene\r\nof the extremity of the tail, and the hind-feet; terminating in\r\nmortification and death.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce is convinced that these symptoms are produced by the\r\ncontinued use of the ergot, or spur of the June grass,--the effects\r\nbeing similar to those produced upon the human family by long-continued\r\nuse of ergot of rye. This disease assumes both an acute and chronic\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman also says: \"Ordinary observers, as well as those who\r\nclaim to be scientific, have entertained very conflicting opinions as to\r\nits general character; some regarding it as epizoötic, others as\r\ncontagious; some attributing it to atmospheric influence, others to\r\nfoulings in the stable or yard. Others, again, attribute it to freezing\r\nof the feet in winter. Cattle-doctors in a majority of cases, fail to\r\ncure it. I have, however, by a simple course of treatment, effected\r\nmany signal cures. Some parties are so confident of the contagious\r\ncharacter of the disease that they refuse to drive cattle along a road\r\nwhere it is known to exist. They even, oftentimes, wash their boots\r\nprevious to entering their barnyards, after walking over the ground\r\nwhere such diseased cattle have been running.\r\n\r\n\"Caution is both proper and commendable. I do not, however, regard it as\r\na contagious disease, nor can it be transmitted by inoculation. The calf\r\nis carried during the progress of the disease, and delivered in\r\napparently good health. The milk of the cow appears to be unaffected and\r\nharmless. I call this disease _sphacial fever_, or _gangrenous fever_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAD BULL.]\r\n\r\n\"The ergot, or spur of the hay, is confined to the June grass, as far as\r\nmy observation extends; owing, probably, to its early maturity. Most\r\nother kinds of grass are cut before the seeds have matured sufficiently\r\nto produce the spur. I was suspicious of the foulness of the feed before\r\nI examined any hay, and have found the spur in the hay wherever the\r\ndisease is found.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sanford, of Edinburgh, Ohio, purchased one half of a mow of hay\r\nfrom Mr. Bassett, of Randolph, which was removed to his farm in\r\nRandolph, eight miles distant. Of this hay, Mr. Sanford fed eleven cows\r\nsome six or eight weeks. Mr. Bassett had been feeding the same to four\r\ncows. At about the same time, both heads began to show lameness. I\r\nvisited Mr. S. after he had lost six cows, and examined the remaining\r\nfive, four of which were lame and the other showed symptoms of the\r\ndisease. He had two other cows, one of which was loaned to a neighbor,\r\nand the other was fed upon different hay, for convenience. The loaned\r\ncow was returned about the first of March,--the two then running with\r\nthe ailing ones until the 24th of April, when I saw them sound and in\r\ngood health.\r\n\r\n\"I then visited Mr. Bassett's stock, which I found infected with the\r\nsame disease,--he having lost one, and the remaining three being lame,\r\nand much debilitated. The hoofs were sloughing off. Some of the same hay\r\nremained in the snow, which, upon examination, exhibited an abundance of\r\nthe spur. Upon inquiry, I found that no such disease existed between the\r\ntwo farms, or in the neighborhood of either Mr. S. or Mr. B. The\r\npeculiarity of this circumstance at once swept away the last vestige of\r\ndoubt from my mind. Mr. E. Chapman, of Rootstown, accompanied me, and\r\ncan vouch for the correctness of these statements.\r\n\r\n\"He hooted at my opinions, asserting that he understood the disease, and\r\nthat it was caused by the freezing of the feet. He has since, however,\r\nabandoned that idea, and honestly 'acknowledged the corn.' This ergot is\r\nregarded by some as a parasitic fungus, formed in other grains, an\r\nabundant vegeto-animal substance, and much disposed to putrefaction. We\r\nappear to be in the dark regarding its real composition. The little\r\nwhich has been written upon the subject, appears to be founded upon\r\nhypothesis, and that the most obscure. The articles to which I refer may\r\ndiffer in quality or property to a considerable extent, and we may\r\nforever remain in the dark, unless chemical investigation be instituted.\r\n\r\n\"In this particular disease, there appears to be singularity in the\r\nsymptoms through all its various stages, which is likely to originate in\r\nthe peculiarity of the cause which produces them. The effects and\r\nsymptoms arising from the continued use of the ergot of rye, as\r\nmanifested in the human system, have been but briefly hinted at by\r\nauthors, and, probably, some of them are only reasonable conjectures.\r\nAll they say is, that it produces violent headache, spaculation in the\r\nextremities, and death. Hitherto, its effects upon the inferior animal\r\nhave been subjected to no investigation, and its peculiarity in the\r\nsymptoms, differing from like phenomena by other causes, may yet be\r\ndemonstrated. I am not alone in my opinion of this disease. I have taken\r\ncounsel of those whose judgment cannot be questioned. Whatever\r\ndifference of opinion exists is attributable to a want of investigation,\r\nand it will continue to exist until this singular phenomenon is clearly\r\naccounted for. Every opinion should be thoroughly criticized till facts\r\nare obtained. Every man's opinion is sacred to himself, but we should\r\nyield to conviction.\r\n\r\n\"Two classes of this disease are exhibited: one, of irritation, and the\r\nother, of debility; one, an acute, the other, a chronic form. The point\r\nat which it assumes the chronic form is between congestion and\r\ngangrene. By close observation we can discover these to be different and\r\nhigher degrees of the same disease. All subsequent degrees are dependent\r\nupon the first.\r\n\r\n\"The first symptom, or degree, is, probably, an attack upon the\r\nsystematic circulation, produced by a certain medicinal and deleterious\r\nproperty existing in the ergot, and communicated to the blood through\r\nthe absorption of the tongue. This is more evident from the fact that\r\nthe digestive organs retain their normal condition till the last stages\r\nof the chronic form. The blood in the first two stages is healthy, and\r\nthe peculiar influence is only apparent in the subsequent stages; as\r\nevidenced by the fact that the muscles and general good appearance, as\r\nwell as life itself, last longer than could be possible, if this\r\ndeleterious influence were exhausted upon the digestive organs and the\r\nblood, in its first stages. And, as we suppose that fever and congestion\r\nconstitute an attack upon the red blood, which is exhibited by hurried\r\npulsation, we might rationally infer that the next degree would be\r\ngangrene of the globule, causing sloughing, the same as if it were\r\ncarried to the muscles, or surface. This sloughing of the globule would\r\nbe the same as if exhibited on any other part of the organization, for\r\nthe fibrin is identical with muscle, as albumen is identical with the\r\nwhite of an egg; and since congestion is the forerunner of gangrene at\r\nthe extremities, or on the surface, so fever and quick pulsation are the\r\nforerunners of congestion of the blood. Gangrene cannot ensue without\r\nobstruction in the blood-vessels; and congestion cannot take place\r\nwithout obstruction in that which sustains the globule. As gangrene,\r\nthen, is the first stage of decomposition of animal matter, so is\r\ncongestion the first stage of decomposition of the globule; and as\r\nmortification is death in the organized body, so is congestion death in\r\nthe organized globule.\r\n\r\n\"It appears evident that this disease, in all its forms and degrees of\r\nintensity, seeks vent or release; in other words, Nature conflicting\r\nwith it, throws it off its track, or balance, and offers means of\r\nescape, or shows it a door by which it may make its exit. In the first\r\nstage of the disease, the dermoid (skin) tissues make the effort. In the\r\ninflammatory, the serous, and the congestive, the mucous gangrene seeks\r\nvent; if obtained, mortification is prevented; if not, mortification\r\ndirectly supervenes, and death terminates the case.\r\n\r\n\"In the case to which I refer, observation confirms my opinion that\r\nabsolute mortification without vent determines the gangrene of the\r\nblood, and is hardly curable; but that gangrene's finding vent\r\ndetermines it to be curable, and the recovery highly probable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIZOÖTIC CATARRH.\r\n\r\nCatarrh frequently assumes an epizoötic form of a very virulent\r\ncharacter, originating spontaneously and extending over a large section\r\nof country at or about the same time. A cold spring succeeding a mild\r\nwinter, is peculiarly productive of malignant catarrh. This is one of\r\nthe most distressing and fatal diseases to which cattle are subject.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animal appears dull, and unwilling to move about,\r\nstaggering when forced to do so; obstinate costiveness is usually one of\r\nthe earliest symptoms, succeeded by diarrhoea, which is equally\r\ndifficult of management; sometimes, however, diarrhoea is present\r\nfrom the first; the animal loses flesh rapidly; the coat is staring;\r\nappetite is lost; tumors form about the head, neck, back, and joints,\r\nwhich appear to be filled with air, and upon pressure cause a\r\ncrepitating sound; saliva flows from the mouth, becoming very fetid as\r\nthe disease progresses. The animal always dies of putrefaction.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This disease should be treated early, or not at all. Good\r\nnursing is very essential. When costiveness is present, give Barbadoes\r\naloes, one ounce; croton-oil, ten drops; mix together; or give one pint\r\nof linseed-oil, to which add from ten to twenty drops of castor-oil. If\r\nthe bowels are not open in twenty-four hours, give four ounces of\r\nsulphate of magnesia every six hours until they are opened. Follow this\r\nwith tincture of aconite, ten drops in water, every four hours, until\r\nthe fever has abated.\r\n\r\nBleeding has been recommended by some writers; but the author has failed\r\nto experience any benefit from resorting to it, but, on the contrary,\r\nhas seen much injury result from the use--or, rather, the abuse--of the\r\nlancet. He is, indeed, inclined to attribute much of the fatality\r\nattending this disease to indiscriminate blood-letting.\r\n\r\nWhen much debility exists, the animal should be sustained by tonics and\r\nstimulants. One ounce of nitric ether and half an ounce of tincture of\r\nopium, given in a little water, will be found beneficial. It should be\r\ngiven twice a day. Pulverized gentian-root, one ounce; Jamaica ginger,\r\nhalf an ounce; pulverized cloves, half an ounce; mixed, and divided into\r\nfour powders, one to be given at night and at morning; will be found\r\nuseful, in place of the opium and ether.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARDEL.\r\n\r\nThis disease is properly known by the name of clue-bound. The manyplus,\r\nor omasum (third stomach), frequently becomes so choked up with food\r\nthat it is hard and dry, and the operation of the digestive organs is\r\nvery seriously impaired. The animal eats voraciously, for a time, but\r\nstops suddenly and trembles; the countenance assumes a peculiarly\r\nhaggard appearance; there is a wild expression of the eye; a foaming at\r\nthe mouth; a tendency to pitch forward, and at times a falling\r\nhead-foremost to the ground. Occasionally, the symptoms are very active,\r\nspeedily terminating in death. There are few diseases of a\r\nconstitutional character in which the stomach is not, more or less,\r\nsympathetically involved.\r\n\r\n\"Toward the end of September, 1746, a great number of cows died at\r\nOsterwich, in the principality of Halberstadt. Lieberkuhn, a celebrated\r\nphysician,--there were no veterinary surgeons at that time,--was sent to\r\nexamine into the nature of the disease, which was supposed to be one of\r\nthe species of murrain that was then committing such ravages among the\r\ncattle in various parts of the Continent. There were none of the tumors,\r\nor pestilential buboes, that, in an earlier or later period of the\r\nmalady, usually accompanied and characterized murrain; but upon\r\ninspection of the dead bodies, considerable peritoneal inflammation was\r\nfound; the first and second stomachs were filled with food, but the\r\nthird stomach was the palpable seat of the disease; its leaves were\r\nblack and gangrened. The mass contained between the leaves was black,\r\ndry, and so hard that it could scarcely be cut with a scalpel. It\r\nintercepted the passage of the food from the first two stomachs to the\r\nfourth; and this latter stomach was empty and much inflamed. Neither the\r\nheart, nor the lungs, nor the intestines exhibited any trace of disease.\r\nTwelve cows were opened, and the appearances were nearly the same in all\r\nof them.\"\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give one and a half pounds of Epsom-salts, dissolved in\r\nthree pints of water; or one quart of potash, three times daily,\r\ndissolved in water, will be found useful in this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUL IN THE FOOT.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by hard or irritating substances making their way in\r\nbetween the claws of the foot, causing inflammation, and sometimes\r\nulceration, in the parts. The pasterns swell, and the animal becomes\r\nlame.\r\n\r\nThe foot should be thoroughly washed, and all foreign substances\r\nremoved. A pledget of tow, saturated with tar and sprinkled with\r\npowdered sulphate of copper, should be inserted between the claws. This\r\nusually requires but one or two applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARGET.\r\n\r\nThis is a hard, knotty condition of the udder, which sometimes follows\r\ncalving, in consequence of the sudden distention of the bag with milk;\r\nand the inflammation which supervenes causes a congealed or coagulated\r\ncondition of the milk to take place, of which, if neglected, suppuration\r\nand abscesses are the result.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Let the calf suck the dam as speedily as possible, and, if\r\nthe hardness is not then removed, foment the udder with warm water;\r\nafter which, wipe it dry, and apply to the entire surface melted lard as\r\nhot as the animal will bear. This is, generally, all that is required,\r\nthe most obstinate cases yielding to it. If abscesses form, they should\r\nbe lanced.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTRO-ENTERITIS.\r\n\r\nThis disease--otherwise known as wood-evil, or moor-ill--arises from\r\neating the buds of oak, young ash, and other trees, which are of a very\r\nhighly stimulating or irritating character. As the intestinal canal is\r\nliable to inflammatory action from irritant substances admitted into it,\r\nanimals are found to become diseased from eating too freely of these\r\nvegetable substances.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Loss of appetite and suspended rumination; mouth hot; skin\r\ndry; pulse from sixty to seventy; swelling and pain of the belly;\r\nobstinate constipation; fæces hard and covered with blood; urine of a\r\nstrong odor, highly colored, and voided with difficulty.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal should be bled, and a strong purgative\r\nadministered, followed by aconite and belladonna, as in enteritis.\r\nInjections of Castile-soap and water should be freely used; the\r\napplication of the mustard, hartshorn, and water to the belly will also\r\nbe found very beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOSE.\r\n\r\nThis disease--known also as catarrh--is occasionally the sequence of\r\ncoryza, but more frequently it arises from an impure atmosphere;\r\nconsequently, in cow-houses where animals are crowded together in\r\nnumbers, it is most frequently found. Scanty provender, and of an\r\ninferior quality, is among the exciting causes of hoose, producing, as\r\nit does, a debilitated state of the system, which, upon exposure of the\r\nanimal to cold, or wet, hastens the disorder. Some breeds of cattle are\r\npeculiarly liable to this disease, which, if not arrested in its early\r\nstage, runs on, involving the lungs, and frequently terminating in\r\nconsumption. Of all our domestic animals, neat cattle are most subject\r\nto pulmonary diseases. This is attributable to the neglect and exposure\r\nwhich are far too often their lot. Butchers will testify that a large\r\nportion of all cattle slaughtered have abscesses and other diseases of\r\nthe lungs.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Loss of appetite; muzzle dry; coat rough, or staring;\r\nrespiration quickened; horns hot; ears, nose, and legs cold; husky\r\ncough; pulse from sixty to seventy, small and thready; bowels frequently\r\nconstipated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give one ounce of the following powders every six hours,\r\nuntil the bowels are opened: Barbadoes aloes, one and half ounces;\r\nnitrate of potassa, half an ounce; ginger, six drachms; mix and divide\r\ninto six powders. Setons in the dewlap are often of great benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOVE.\r\n\r\nHoove, or blown, so common, and often so speedily fatal in cattle, is\r\nthe result of fermentation in the _rumen_, or paunch, in consequence of\r\nthe animal's having eaten large quantities of wet grass, luxuriant\r\nclover, turnips, etc. An accumulation of gas is the result of this\r\nfermentation, which greatly disturbs the haunch and left side of the\r\nbelly, causing much pain to the animal, and frequently threatening\r\nsuffocation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Drench the animal with one ounce of spirits of hartshorn\r\nin one quart of water, the object being to neutralize the gas which is\r\npresent in the rumen; or, two ounces of table salt dissolved in one\r\nquart of water will be found very effectual. If these do not speedily\r\ngive relief, an active purge should be given. Injections of soap and\r\nwater should be freely used. If the case still proves obstinate, and the\r\nlife of the animal is threatened, the paunch should be punctured. For\r\nthis purpose, the trochar--an instrument specially adapted--should be\r\nused; but, in the absence of an instrument, an ordinary pocket-knife may\r\nbe employed, taking care not to make a large opening. The proper point\r\nto operate is midway between the last rib and the prominent point of the\r\nhip-bone, about twelve inches from the centre of the back or loins. Few\r\ncases have a fatal termination where this operation has been properly\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDATIDS.\r\n\r\nWorms in the brain occasionally occur, causing great uneasiness to the\r\nanimal and generally proving fatal.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are, loss of appetite; suspended rumination; a fevered\r\ncondition of the system; horns and ears hot; respiration disturbed; coat\r\nstaring, etc. No course of treatment will prove efficacious in this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nPressure on the brain may occur from an accumulation of water, tumors,\r\nbruises, etc., in the cranial case. In either case, the same effects are\r\nproduced as are observed in apoplexy.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the bladder generally accompanies inflammation of the\r\nkidneys, though it is sometimes found disconnected and alone. It is\r\noccasionally caused by calculous concretions in the bladder,--which\r\nshould be removed,--causing very acute abdominal pain to the animal. She\r\nmakes frequent efforts to stale, passing but a few drops of urine at a\r\ntime. The pulse is full and rapid; mouth clammy; nose dry; eyes\r\nbloodshot; appetite lost; moaning, and walking with a staggering gait.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Inject into the bladder one quart of tepid water, and from\r\none to two ounces of tincture of opium mixed together. Give internally\r\none of the following powders every hour until relieved; nitrate of\r\npotassa, one ounce; tartrate of antimony, and pulverized digitalis\r\nleaves, each one drachm; mix, and divide into six powders. Mucilaginous\r\ndraughts should be freely given.\r\n\r\nRupture of the bladder sometimes occurs, but there are no symptoms by\r\nwhich it may be known; and, if there were, no service could be rendered\r\nin the way of repairing the injury; the animal must die.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE HAW.\r\n\r\nThe ox, like the horse, has a membrane of semilunar form in the inner\r\ncorner of the eye, which is capable of being thrown over the entire\r\neyeball, for the purpose of cleansing the eye from any foreign substance\r\nwhich may get into it. This membrane is commonly called the haw, and is\r\nsusceptible of attacks of inflammation, which cause it to swell,\r\nfrequently even closing up the eye.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give a dose of physic, and, if the animal is plethoric,\r\nextract a little blood from the vein on the same side as the affected\r\neye. Apply to the eye either of the following washes: tincture of opium,\r\none ounce; rain-water, one pint; or, tincture of aconite, one drachm, to\r\none pint of water. Bathe two or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS.\r\n\r\nThis disease--sometimes called nephritis--occurs occasionally in cattle\r\nin consequence of their eating bad or unwholesome food, or of the abuse\r\nof diuretics, etc.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are very insidious in their approach. The loins are very\r\ntender upon pressure; the urine is voided in small quantities. As the\r\ndisease advances, the symptoms become more marked and acute. The animal\r\nis dull, and feeds daintily; the evacuation of urine is attended with\r\nincreased pain, and the urine is highly colored and bloody; the nose is\r\ndry; the horns, ears, and extremities are cold; respiration hurried; the\r\npulse full, hard, and throbbing.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give one pint of linseed-oil and ten drops of castor-oil,\r\nmixed together; follow this with small doses of salts once a day, for\r\nthree or four days; give injections of water, one half a gallon to two\r\nounces of tincture of arnica. Mustard applications to the loins are also\r\nvery useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the liver are of very common occurrence,--a fact with which\r\nall beef-butchers are familiar. Perhaps no organ in the animal economy\r\nis so liable to disease. The obscurity of the symptoms and the good\r\ncondition of the animal prevent its discovery, as a general thing,\r\nduring its lifetime. When, however, the disease assumes an active\r\nform,--known as the yellows, jaundice, or inflammation of the\r\nliver,--the symptoms are more readily detected.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A yellowish color of the eye will be observed; skin, urine,\r\netc., highly colored; soreness, on pressure, on the right side; loss of\r\nappetite; dullness; constipation of the bowels, etc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Calomel is the most reliable medicine known to\r\npractitioners for diseases of the liver. Its abuse, however, has brought\r\nit into disrepute. Yet, as with ordinary care it may be advantageously\r\nused, we will prescribe it as that upon which the most dependence is to\r\nbe placed, and in doing so, will endeavor to have it used safely.\r\nBleeding has been recommended: but the author has never found any\r\nbenefit resulting. Give Epsom-salts, in doses of four ounces each, every\r\nnight, with one scruple of calomel, until the animal is relieved.\r\nMustard and water should be frequently applied to the right side, and\r\nwell rubbed in.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARYNGITIS.\r\n\r\nThis disease is of rare occurrence in cattle. In it, the mucous membrane\r\nlining the larynx is in a very irritable condition; the least pressure\r\nupon the parts affected causes intensely excruciating pain; the\r\nrespiration becomes quick, painful, and laborious; the animal often\r\nappears to be hungry, yet does not eat much, in consequence of the pain\r\noccasioned by the act of swallowing.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Apply to the throat externally strong mustard, mixed, with\r\nequal parts of aqua ammonia and water, to a thin paste, every hour,\r\nuntil it produces an effect upon the skin; sponging the parts each time\r\nwith warm water before applying the mustard. The animal should not be\r\nbled. Give upon the tongue, or in drink, half-drachm doses of nitrate of\r\npotassa, every three or four hours, until relief is obtained. If\r\nsuffocation threatens, the operation of tracheotomy is the only resort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ABERDEENSHIRE POLLED BULL.]\r\n\r\nCloths saturated with cold water, wrapped around the neck so as to cover\r\nthe larynx, frequently afford relief. A purgative will also be found\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICE.\r\n\r\nCattle are very subject to lice, particularly when they are neglected,\r\nhalf-starved, and in poor condition. Good care and good feeding--in\r\nconnection with the treatment recommended in mange, to which the reader\r\nis referred--will comprise all that is requisite.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGE.\r\n\r\nMange, or leprosy, is one of the most unpleasant and difficult diseases\r\nto manage of all the ailments to which cattle are subject requiring the\r\nnicest care and attention to render it easy of cure. An animal badly\r\nnursed will not, under the most skillful treatment, quickly recover. Its\r\ncauses are in the main, due to poor food, which produces a debilitated\r\ncondition of the system, and in connection with a want of cleanliness,\r\ncauses a development of the _acari_, or minute insects, exciting very\r\ngreat irritation upon the skin and causing the cow to rub herself\r\nagainst every object with which she comes in contact. The hair falls\r\noff; a scurfy appearance of the skin is perceptible; and the animal is\r\npoor in condition and in milk. The great trouble in treating this\r\ndisease springs from its contagious character; for, no sooner is the\r\nanimal, oftentimes, once free from the _acari_ than it comes in contact\r\nwith some object against which it has previously been rubbing, when the\r\n_acari_ which were left upon that object are again brought in contact\r\nwith the animal, and the disease is reproduced. If, immediately after\r\nthe proper applications are made, the animal is removed to other\r\nquarters, and not allowed to return to the former ones for six or eight\r\nweeks, there is, generally speaking, but little trouble in treating the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nTake the animal upon a warm, sunny day, and with a scrubbing-brush\r\ncleanse the skin thoroughly with Castile-soap and water; when dry, apply\r\nin the same manner the following mixture; white hellebore, one ounce;\r\nsulphur flower, three ounces; gas-water, one quart; mix all well\r\ntogether. One or two applications are, generally, all that will be\r\nrequired. Give internally one of the following powders in the feed,\r\nnight and morning: flowers of sulphur, two ounces; black antimony, one\r\nounce; nitrate of potassa, one ounce; mix, and divide into eight\r\npowders.\r\n\r\n\r\nMURRAIN.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most malignant diseases to which cattle are liable.\r\nFortunately, however, true murrain is comparatively rare in this great\r\nstock-raising country.\r\n\r\nThe entire system seems to partake of the disease. The first indication\r\nof its approach is a feverish condition of the system, attended with a\r\nfrequent and painful cough; the pulse is small, hard, and rapid. As the\r\ndisease advances, the respiration becomes disturbed; the flanks heave;\r\nvesicular eruption is observed upon the teats, mouth, and feet; the\r\nhorns are cold; the animal is sometimes lame; constipation and,\r\nsometimes, diarrhoea are accompanying symptoms; _fæces_ black and\r\nfetid; the eyes weep and become much swollen; great tenderness along the\r\nspine; a brown or bloody discharge from the nose and mouth; the animal\r\nmoans incessantly, grinds his teeth, rarely lies down, but to get up\r\nagain quickly; finally, the breath becomes very offensive; tumors make\r\ntheir appearance in various parts of the body, which, in favorable\r\ncases, suppurate, and discharge a fetid matter.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give one fourth of a pound of Epsom-salts, with one drachm\r\nof Jamaica ginger, twice a day, for two or three days. A bottle of\r\nporter, twice a day, will be found serviceable. Very little medicine is\r\nrequired internally in this disease, but much depends upon good nursing.\r\nExternal applications are chiefly to be depended upon. A solution of\r\nchloride of lime should be applied to the eruptions, or a solution of\r\nthe chloride of zinc, twenty grains to an ounce of water; or, of\r\nsulphate of zinc, two drachms to a pint of water; or pulverized\r\ncharcoal applied to the parts will be found useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVEL-ILL.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the navel in calves occasionally occurs, causing\r\nredness, pain, and sudden swelling in the part affected. This disease,\r\nif not promptly attended to, speedily carries off the creature.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Foment the part well with warm hop-tea; after which, the\r\napplication of a cloth, well saturated with lead-water and secured by\r\nbandages, should be applied. Internally, doses of Epsom-salts, of two\r\nounces each, dissolved in half a pint of water, should be given until\r\nthe bowels are acted upon. After the inflammation has subsided, to\r\ncounteract the weakness which may follow, give a bottle of porter two or\r\nthree times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTIONS IN THE OESOPHAGUS.\r\n\r\nChoking in cattle is of common occurrence, in consequence of turnips,\r\npotatoes, carrots, or other hard substances, becoming lodged in the\r\noesophagus, or gullet.\r\n\r\nThese obstructions can sometimes be removed by careful manipulations\r\nwith the hand; but, where this can not be accomplished, the flexible\r\nprobang should be employed. This is a long India-rubber tube, with a\r\nwhalebone stillet running through it, so as to stiffen it when in use.\r\nThis instrument is passed down the animal's throat, and the offending\r\nsubstance is thus pushed down into the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPEN JOINTS.\r\n\r\nOpening of the joint generally results from accidents, from puncturing\r\nwith sharp substances, from kicks, blows, etc. These injuries cause\r\nconsiderable nervous irritation in the system, and sometimes cause\r\nlock-jaw and death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Close up the wound as speedily as possible. The\r\nfiring-iron will sometimes answer the purpose very well. The author\r\ndepends more upon the application of collodion--as recommended in his\r\nwork upon \"The Horse and His Diseases\" for the same trouble--than upon\r\nany other remedy. It requires care in its application, in order to make\r\nit adhere firmly. Shoemakers'-wax, melted and applied, answers a very\r\ngood purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTURITION.\r\n\r\nIn natural labor--as has been suggested in a former part of this\r\nwork--the aid of man is rarely required in bringing away the calf. But\r\nit not infrequently happens that, from malformation or wrong\r\npresentation, our assistance is required in order to deliver the animal.\r\n\r\nThe brute force, which has been far too often heretofore resorted to,\r\nshould no longer be tolerated, since the lives of many valuable animals\r\nhave been sacrificed by such treatment. Very often, by gentle\r\nmanipulation with the greased hand, the womb can be so dilated as to\r\nafford a comparatively easy exit for the _foetus_.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the calf is presented wrong, it must be pushed back and\r\nplaced in its proper position, if possible. In natural labor, the\r\nfore-legs, with the head lying between them, are presented; in which\r\nposition--unless deformity, either in the _pelvis_ of the cow, or in the\r\n_foetus_, exists--the calf is passed with little difficulty, and\r\nwithout assistance. It sometimes happens that the head of the foetus\r\nis turned backward. When this happens, the attendant should at once\r\nstrip himself to the waist, bathe his arms, and hands with a little\r\nsweet-oil, or lard, and introduce them into the _vagina_, placing a cord\r\naround both fore-feet, and then, pushing them back, search for the head,\r\nwhich is to be brought forward to its proper position. The feet are next\r\nto be brought up with it. No force should be used, except when the cow\r\nherself makes the effort to expel the calf; otherwise, more harm than\r\ngood may be done.\r\n\r\nA case of this kind recently occurred in the author's practice, being\r\nthe third within a year. The subject was a cow belonging to William\r\nHance, Esq., of Bordentown, New Jersey. After she had been in labor for\r\nsome twenty hours, he was called upon to see her. Upon inquiry, he found\r\nthat several persons had been trying, without success, to relieve her.\r\nShe was very much prostrated, and would, doubtless, have died within two\r\nor three hours, had no relief been afforded. The legs of the _foetus_\r\nprotruded as far as the knees; the head was turned backward, and with\r\nthe body, pressed firmly into the _vagina_, so that it was impossible to\r\nreturn it, or to bring the head forward. The operation of embryotomy\r\nwas, therefore, at once performed, by cutting away the right shoulder,\r\nwhich enabled the operator, with the aid of his appropriate hooks, to\r\nbring the head forward, when the calf came away without further\r\ntrouble,--the whole operation not requiring fifteen minutes. The\r\n_uterus_ was then washed out, and the animal placed in as comfortable a\r\nposition as possible, and a stimulating draught given, composed of two\r\nounces of nitric ether, one ounce of tincture of opium, and a half pint\r\nof water. This was followed with a few doses of Fleming's tincture of\r\naconite, ten drops in a little water, every few hours. In a few days the\r\nanimal had entirely recovered.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, the head comes first, or the head and one leg. In such\r\ncases, a cord should be slipped around the jaw and leg, and these then\r\npushed back, so as to allow the other leg to be brought up. When this\r\ncannot be done, the _foetus_ can, in most cases, be removed in the\r\noriginal position.\r\n\r\nBreech, side, back, and other presentations sometimes occur; in all of\r\nwhich instances, the _foetus_ must be turned in such a position that\r\nit can be brought away with as little trouble as possible. When this\r\ncannot be accomplished, the only resort is embryotomy, or cutting up of\r\nthe _foetus_, which operation can only be safely performed by the\r\nqualified veterinary surgeon.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above, another case has occurred in the author's\r\npractice. The cow--belonging to Samuel Barton, Esq., near Bordentown,\r\nNew Jersey--had been in labor some eighteen hours; upon an examination\r\nof the animal, the calf was found to be very much deformed, presenting\r\nbackwards,--one of the hind-legs having been pulled off by the person or\r\npersons assisting her previous to the author's arrival. Finding it\r\nimpossible to deliver her in the usual way, embryotomy was in this\r\ninstance employed. By this means, after taking out the intestines,\r\nlungs, etc., of the _foetus_, and cutting away its hind-quarters, the\r\nfore-parts were brought away. The head presented a singular appearance;\r\nthe under jaw was so twisted as to bring the front teeth on the side of\r\nthe face; the spinal column or back-bone, was turned twice around,\r\nresembling a spiral string; the front legs were over the back; the ribs\r\nwere much contorted; the hind-parts were as much deformed; and, taken\r\naltogether, the deformity was the most singular which has been brought\r\nunder the author's observation.\r\n\r\nFREE MARTINS.--It has long been supposed by stockbreeders, that if a cow\r\nproduce twins, one of which is a male and the other a female, the female\r\nis incapable of producing young, but that the male may be a useful\r\nanimal for breeding purposes. Many instances have occurred when the twin\r\nsister of a bull has never shown the least desire for the male.\r\n\r\nThis indifference to sexual commerce arises, doubtless, from the\r\nanimal's being but imperfectly developed in the organs of generation.\r\nThis fact has been established by the investigations of Mr. John Hunter,\r\nwho had three of these animals slaughtered for anatomical examination.\r\nThe result is thus reported: \"The external parts were rather smaller\r\nthan is customary in the cow. The _vagina_ passed on, as in the cow, to\r\nthe opening of the _urethra_, and then it began to contract into a small\r\ncanal, which passed on into the division of the _uterus_ into the two\r\nhorns; each horn passed along the edge of the broad ligament laterally\r\ntoward the _ovaria_.\r\n\r\n\"At the termination of these horns were placed both the ovaries and the\r\ntesticles. Both were nearly of the same size, which was about as large\r\nas a small nutmeg. To the _ovaria_, I could not find any Fallopian\r\ntube.\r\n\r\n\"To the testicles were _vasa deferentia_, but they were imperfect. The\r\nleft one did not come near the testicle; the right one only came close\r\nto it, but did not terminate in the body called the _epididymis_. They\r\nwere both pervious and opened into the _vagina_, near the opening of the\r\n_urethra_.\r\n\r\n\"On the posterior surface of the bladder, or between the _uterus_ and\r\nthe bladder, were the two bags, called _vesiculæ seminales_ in the male,\r\nbut much smaller than they are in the bull. The ducts opened along with\r\nthe _vasa deferentia_. This animal, then, had a mixture of all the\r\nparts, but all of them were imperfect.\"\r\n\r\nWell-authenticated cases have, however, occurred where the female has\r\nbred, and the offspring proved to be good milkers. There are several\r\ninstances on record of cows' giving birth to three, four, and even five\r\ncalves at a time. There were on exhibition, in 1862, at Bordentown, New\r\nJersey, three free martins, two sisters and a brother, which were\r\nbeautiful animals. These were from a cow belonging to Mr. Joab Mershon,\r\nresiding on Biles Island, situated in the Delaware River, a short\r\ndistance above Bordentown. They were calved November 1st, 1858, and were\r\ntherefore nearly four years of age. They had never shown the least\r\ndesire for copulation. Their aggregate weight was 4300 pounds.\r\n\r\nWe extract the following from the London Veterinarian, for 1854:--\"A\r\ncow, belonging to Mr. John Marshall, of Repton, on Wednesday last, gave\r\nbirth to _five, live healthy calves_, all of which are, at the time I\r\nwrite, alive and vigorous, and have every appearance of continuing so.\r\nThey are all nearly of a size, and are larger and stronger than could be\r\nsupposed. Four of them are bull-calves.\r\n\r\n\"The dam is by no means a large one, is eleven years old, of a mongrel\r\nbreed, and has never produced more than one offspring at any previous\r\ngestation. I saw her two days after she had calved, at which time she\r\nwas ruminating, and did not manifest any unusual symptoms of exhaustion.\r\nI may mention that the first four calves presented naturally; the fifth\r\nwas a breech-presentation.\"\r\n\r\nCLEANSING.--The _placenta_, or after-birth, by which the _foetus_ is\r\nnourished while in embryo, should be removed soon after calving.\r\nGenerally, it will come away without any assistance. This is what is\r\ncalled \"cleansing after calving.\" When, however, it remains for some\r\ntime, its function having been performed, it becomes a foreign body,\r\nexciting uterine contractions, and therefore injurious. The sooner,\r\nthen, it is removed, the better for the animal as well as the owner. To\r\naccomplish this, the hand should be introduced, and, by pulling gently\r\nin various directions, it will soon yield and come away. Should it be\r\nallowed to remain, it rapidly decomposes, producing a low, feverish\r\ncondition of the system, which greatly interferes with the general\r\nhealth of the animal.\r\n\r\nINVERSION OF THE UTERUS.--The _uterus_ is sometimes turned inside out\r\nafter calving. This is, generally, the result of debility, or severe\r\nlabor. The _uterus_ should be replaced as carefully as possible with the\r\nhands, care being taken that no dirt, straw, or other foreign substance\r\nadheres to it. Should it again be expelled, it would be advisable to\r\nquiet the system by the use of an anæsthetic, as chloroform, or--which\r\nis much safer--chloric ether. As soon as the animal is under the\r\ninfluence of this, the _uterus_ may be again replaced. The\r\nhind-quarters should be raised as high as possible, in order to favor\r\nits retention. The animal should have a little gruel and a bottle of\r\nporter given to her every five or six hours, and the _vulva_ should be\r\nbathed frequently with cold water.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHRENITIS.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the brain is one of those dreadful diseases to which all\r\nanimals are liable. It is known to the farmer as frenzy, mad staggers,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe active symptoms are preceded by stupor; the animal stubbornly stands\r\nin one position; the eyes are full, red, and fiery; respiration rapid;\r\ndelirium soon succeeds; the animal, bellowing, dashes wildly about, and\r\nseems bent on mischief, rushing madly at every object which comes in its\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this disease are overwork in warm weather, a plethoric\r\ncondition of the system, and too stimulating food. Prof. Gamgee, of the\r\nEdinburgh Veterinary College, relates a case resulting from the presence\r\nwithin the external _meatus_ of a mass of concrete cerumen, or wax,\r\nwhich induced inflammation of the ear, extending to the brain.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As this is attended with considerable risk, unless it is\r\ntaken prior to the frenzied stage, bleeding almost to fainting should be\r\nresorted to, and followed by a brisk purge. Take one ounce of Barbadoes\r\naloes, and ten to fifteen drops of Croton-oil; mix the aloes with one\r\npint of water and the oil, using the mixture as a drench. One pound of\r\nEpsom-salts will answer the purpose very well, in cases where the aloes\r\nand oil cannot be readily obtained. Application of bags of broken ice to\r\nthe head, is very beneficial. Spirits of turpentine, or mustard,\r\ntogether with spirits of hartshorn and water should be well rubbed in\r\nalong the spine, from the neck to the tail.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURISY.\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammation of the _pleura_, or the serous membrane which\r\nlines the cavity of the chest, and which is deflected over the lungs.\r\nInflammation of this membrane rarely occurs in a pure form, but is more\r\ngenerally associated with inflammation of the tissue of the lungs. If\r\nthis disease is not attended to at an early period, its usual\r\ntermination is in hydrothorax, or dropsy of the chest. The same causes\r\nwhich produce inflammation of the lungs, of the bronchia, and of the\r\nother respiratory organs, produce also pleurisy.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The respiration is quick, short, and painful; pressure\r\nbetween the ribs produces much pain; a low, short, painful cough is\r\npresent; the respiratory murmur is much diminished,--in fact, it is\r\nscarcely audible. This condition is rapidly followed by effusion, which\r\nmay be detected from the dullness of the sounds, on applying the ear to\r\nthe lower part of the lungs. The febrile symptoms disappear; the animal\r\nfor a few days appears to improve, but soon becomes weak, languid, and\r\noften exhausted from the slightest exertion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The same treatment in the early stage is enjoined as in\r\ninflammatory pneumonia, which the reader will consult--counter-irritation\r\nand purgatives. Bleeding never should be resorted to. When effusion\r\ntakes place, it is necessary to puncture the sides with a trochar, and\r\ndraw away the fluid, giving internally one of the following purges three\r\ntimes a day: rosin, eight ounces; saltpetre, two ounces, mix, and divide\r\ninto eight powders. Half-drachm doses of the iodide of potash,\r\ndissolved in water, to be given three times daily, will be found useful\r\nin this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURO-PNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\nThis disease, as its name implies, is an inflammatory condition of the\r\nlungs and the _pleura_, or the enveloping membrane of the lungs and the\r\nlining membrane of the chest. It is sometimes called contagious,\r\ninfectious, and epizoötic pleuro-pneumonia,--contagious or infectious,\r\nfrom its supposed property of transmission from the diseased to the\r\nhealthy animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKING AN OBSERVATION.]\r\n\r\nA contagious character the author is not ready to assign to\r\nit,--contagious, as he understands it, being strictly applicable to\r\nthose diseases which depend upon actual contact with the poison that it\r\nmay be communicated from one animal to another. This does not\r\nnecessarily imply the actual touching of the animals themselves; for it\r\nmay be communicated from the poison left in the trough, or other places\r\nwhere the diseased animal has been brought in contact with some object,\r\nas is often the case in glanders in the horse; the matter discharged\r\nfrom the nose, and left upon the manger, readily communicating that\r\ndisease to healthy animals coming in contact with it. Contagious\r\ndiseases, therefore, travel very slowly, starting, as they do, at one\r\npoint, and gradually spreading over a large district, or section of\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis disease is, however, regarded by the author as infectious; by which\r\nterm is meant that it is capable of being communicated from the diseased\r\nto the healthy animal through the medium of the air, which has become\r\ncontaminated by the exhalations of poisonous matter. The ability to\r\ninoculate other animals in this way is necessarily confined to a limited\r\nspace, sometimes not extending more than a few yards. Infectious\r\ndiseases, accordingly, spread with more rapidity than contagious ones,\r\nand are, consequently, more to be dreaded; since we can avoid the one\r\nwith comparatively little trouble, while the other often steals upon us\r\nwhen we regard ourselves as beyond its influence, carrying death and\r\ndestruction in its course.\r\n\r\nThe term by which this disease is known, is a misnomer. Pleuro-pneumonia\r\nproper is neither a contagious, nor an infectious disease; hence, the\r\ndenial of medical men that this so-called pleuro-pneumonia is a\r\ncontagious, or infectious disease, has been the means of unnecessarily\r\nexposing many animals to its poisonous influence.\r\n\r\nIn the _Recuéil de Médécine Vétérinaire_, for 1833, will be found a very\r\ninteresting description of this fatal malady. The author, M. Lecoy,\r\nAssistant Professor at the Veterinary School of Lyons, France, says:\r\n\"There are few districts in the _arrondissement_ of Avesnes where more\r\ncattle are fattened than in that of Soire-le-Chateau. The farmers being\r\nunable to obtain a sufficient supply of cattle in the district, are\r\nobliged to purchase the greater part of them from other provinces; and\r\nthey procure a great number for grazing from Franche Comté. The cattle\r\nof this country are very handsome; their forms are compact; they fatten\r\nrapidly; and they are a kind of cattle from which the grazer would\r\nderive most advantage, were it not that certain diseases absorb, by the\r\nloss of some of the animals, the profits of the rest of the herd.\r\nAmongst the diseases which most frequently attack the cattle which are\r\nbrought from the North, there is one very prevalent in some years, and\r\nwhich is the more to be dreaded as it is generally incurable; and the\r\nslaughter of the animal, before he is perceptibly wasted, is the only\r\nmeans by which the farmer can avoid losing the whole value of the beast.\r\n\r\n\"This disease is chronic pleuro-pneumonia. The symptoms are scarcely\r\nrecognizable at first, and often the beast is ill for a long time\r\nwithout its being perceived. He fattens well, and when he is slaughtered\r\nthe owner is astonished to find scarcely half of the lungs capable of\r\ndischarging the function of respiration. When, however, the ox has not\r\nsufficient strength of constitution to resist the ravages of disease,\r\nthe first symptom which is observed is diminution, or irregularity of\r\nappetite. Soon afterwards, a frequent, dry cough is heard, which becomes\r\nfeeble and painful as the disease proceeds. The dorso-lumbar portion of\r\nthe spine (loins) grows tender; the animal flinches when the part is\r\npressed upon, and utters a peculiar groan, or grunt, which the graziers\r\nregard as decisive of the malady.\r\n\r\n\"Quickly after this, the movements of the flanks become irregular and\r\naccelerated, and the act of respiration is accompanied by a kind of\r\nbalancing motion of the whole body. The sides of the chest become as\r\ntender as the loins, or more so; for the animal immediately throws\r\nhimself down, if pressed upon with any force. The elbows become, in many\r\nsubjects, more and more separated from the sides of the chest. The pulse\r\nis smaller than natural, and not considerably increased. The muzzle is\r\nhot and dry, alternately. The animal lies down as in a healthy state,\r\nbut rumination is partially or entirely suspended. The _fæces_ are\r\nharder than they should be; the urine is of its natural color and\r\nquantity; the mouth is often dry; and the horns and ears retain their\r\nnatural temperature.\r\n\r\n\"This first stage of the disease sometimes continues during a month, or\r\nmore, and then, if the animal is to recover, or at least, apparently so,\r\nthe symptoms gradually disappear. First of all, the appetite returns,\r\nand the beast begins to acquire a little flesh. The proprietor should\r\nthen make haste and get rid of him; for it is very rare that the malady,\r\nhowever it may be palliated for a while, does not reappear with greater\r\nintensity than before.\r\n\r\n\"In most cases, the disease continues to pursue its course toward its\r\ntermination without any remission,--every symptom gradually increasing\r\nin intensity. The respiration becomes more painful; the head is more\r\nextended; the eyes are brilliant; every expiration is accompanied with a\r\ngrunt, and by a kind of puckering of the angles of the lips; the cough\r\nbecomes smaller, more suppressed, and more painful; the tongue protrudes\r\nfrom the mouth, and a frothy mucus is abundantly discharged; the breath\r\nbecomes offensive; a purulent fluid of a bloody color escapes from the\r\nnostrils; diarrhoea, profuse and fetid, succeeds to the constipation;\r\nthe animal becomes rapidly weaker; he is a complete skeleton, and at\r\nlength he dies.\r\n\r\n\"Examination after death discloses slight traces of inflammation in the\r\nintestines, discoloration of the liver, and a hard, dry substance\r\ncontained in the manyplus. The lungs adhere to the sides and to the\r\ndiaphragm by numerous bands, evidently old and very firm. The substance\r\nof the lungs often presents a reddish-gray hepatization throughout\r\nalmost its whole extent. At other times, there are tubercles in almost\r\nevery state of hardness, and in that of suppuration. The portion of the\r\nlungs that is not hepatized is red, and gorged with blood. Besides the\r\nold adhesions, there are numerous ones of recent date. The pleura is not\r\nmuch reddened, but by its thickness in some points, its adhesion in\r\nothers, and the effusion of a serous fluid, it proves how much and how\r\nlong it has participated in the inflammatory action. The trachea and the\r\nbronchia are slightly red, and the right side of the head is gorged with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n\"In a subject in which, during life, I could scarcely feel the beating\r\nof the heart, I found the whole of the left lobe of the lungs adhering\r\nto the sides, and completely hepatized. In another, that had presented\r\nno sign of disease of the chest, and that for some days before his death\r\nvomited the little fodder which he could take, the whole of that portion\r\nof the oesophagus that passed through the chest was surrounded with\r\ndense false membranes, of a yellowish hue, ranging from light to dark,\r\nand being in some parts more than an inch in thickness, and adhering\r\nclosely to the muscular membrane of the tube, without allowing any\r\ntrace to be perceived of that portion of the mediastinal pleura on which\r\nthis unnatural covering was fixed and developed.\r\n\r\n\"The cattle purchased in Franche Comté are brought to Avesnes at two\r\nperiods of the year--in autumn and in the spring. Those which are\r\nbrought in autumn are much more subject to the disease than those which\r\nhave arrived in the spring; and it almost always happens that the years\r\nin which it shows itself most generally are those in which the weather\r\nwas most unfavorable while the cattle were on the road. The journey is\r\nperformed by two different routes,--through Lorraine and through\r\nChampagne,--and the disease frequently appears in cattle that have\r\narrived by one of these routes. The manner in which the beasts are\r\ntreated, on their arrival, may contribute not a little to the\r\ndevelopment of the malady. These animals, which have been driven long\r\ndistances in bad weather, and frequently half starved, arrived famished,\r\nand therefore the more fatigued, and some of them lame. Calculating on\r\ntheir ravenous appetite, the graziers, instead of giving them wholesome\r\nfood, make them consume the worst that the farm contains,--musty and\r\nmouldy fodder; and it is usually by the cough, which the eating of such\r\nfood necessarily produces, that the disease is discovered and first\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\"Is chronic pleuro-pneumonia contagious? The farmers believe that it is,\r\nand I am partly of their opinion. When an animal falls sick in the\r\npasture, the others, after his removal, go and smell at the grass where\r\nhe has lain, and which he has covered with his saliva, and, after that,\r\nnew cases succeed to the first. It is true that this fact is not\r\nconclusive, since the disease also appears in a great number of animals\r\nthat have been widely separated from each other. But I have myself seen\r\nthree cases in which the cattle of the country, perfectly well before,\r\nhave fallen ill, and died with the same symptoms, excepting that they\r\nhave been more acute, after they have been kept with cattle affected\r\nwith this disease. This circumstance inclines me to think that the\r\ndisease is contagious; or, at least, that, in the progress of it, the\r\nbreath infects the cow-house in which there are other animals already\r\npredisposed to the same disease. I am induced to believe that most of\r\nthe serious internal diseases are communicated in this manner, and\r\nparticularly those which affect the organs of respiration, when the\r\nanimals are shut up in close, low, and badly-ventilated cow-houses.\"\r\n[_Rec. de Méd. Vét. Mai, 1833._]\r\n\r\nNo malady can be more terrible and ruinous than this among dairy-stock;\r\nand its spread all over the country, together with its continuance with\r\nscarcely any abatement, must be attributed to the combination of various\r\ncauses. The chief are: _first_, the very contagious or infectious nature\r\nof the disorder; _second_, inattention on the part of Government to the\r\nimportation and subsequent sale of diseased animals; and, _third_, the\r\nrecklessness of purchasers of dairy or feeding cattle.\r\n\r\nThis disease may be defined as an acute inflammation of the organs of\r\nthe chest, with the development of a peculiar and characteristic poison,\r\nwhich is the active element of infection or contagion. It is a disease\r\npeculiar to the cattle tribe, notwithstanding occasional assertions\r\nregarding observations of the disease among horses, sheep, and other\r\nanimals,--which pretended observations have not been well attested.\r\n\r\nThe infectious, or contagious nature of this virulent malady is\r\nincontestibly substantiated by an overwhelming amount of evidence, which\r\ncannot be adduced at full length here, but which may be classified under\r\nthe following heads: _first_, the constant spreading of the disease from\r\ncountries in which it rages to others which, previously to the\r\nimportation of diseased animals, had been perfectly free from it. This\r\nmay be proved in the case of England, into which country it was carried\r\nin 1842, by affected animals from Holland. Twelve months after, it\r\nspread from England to Scotland, by means of some cattle sold at\r\nAll-Hallow Fair, and it was only twelve months afterward that cattle\r\nimported as far north as Inverness took the disease there. Lately, a cow\r\ntaken from England to Australia was observed to be diseased upon\r\nlanding, and the evil results were limited to her owner's stock, who\r\ngave the alarm, and ensured an effectual remedy against a wider spread.\r\nBesides, the recent importation of pleuro-pneumonia into the United\r\nStates from Holland appears to have awakened our agricultural press\r\ngenerally, and to have convinced them of the stubborn fact that our\r\ncattle have been decimated by a fearfully infectious, through probably\r\npreventable, plague. A letter from this country to an English author\r\nsays: \"Its (pleuro-pneumonia's) contagious character seems to be settled\r\nbeyond a doubt, though some of the V.S. practitioners deny it, which is\r\nalmost as reasonable as it would be to deny any other well-authenticated\r\nhistoric fact. Every case of the disease is traceable to one of two\r\nsources; either to Mr. Chenery's stock in Belmont (near Boston,\r\nMassachusetts), into which the disease was introduced by his importation\r\nof four Dutch cows from Holland, which arrived here the 23d of last May;\r\nor else to one of the three calves which he sold to a farmer in North\r\nBrookfield, Massachusetts, last June.\"\r\n\r\n_2dly._ Apart from the importation into countries, we have this certain\r\nproof--to which special attention was drawn several years ago--that\r\ncattle-dealers' farms, and public markets, constitute the busy centres\r\nof infection. Most anxious and careful inquiries have established the\r\nproposition that in breeding-districts, where the proprietors of\r\nextensive dairies--as in Dumfries, Scotland, and other places--abstain\r\nfrom buying, except from their neighbors, who have never had diseases of\r\nthe lungs amongst their stock, pleuro-pneumonia has not been seen. There\r\nis a wide district in the Vicinity of Abington, England, and in the\r\nparish of Crawford, which has not been visited _by_ this plague, with\r\nthe exception of two farms, into which market-cattle had been imported\r\nand thus brought the disease.\r\n\r\n_3dly._ In 1854 appeared a Report of the Researches on Pleuro-Pneumonia,\r\nby a scientific commission, instituted by the Minister of Agriculture in\r\nFrance. This very able pamphlet was edited by Prof. Bouley, of Alfort,\r\nFrance. The members of the commission belonged to the most eminent\r\nveterinarians and agriculturists in France. Magendie was President;\r\nRegnal, Secretary; besides Rayer, the renowned comparative pathologist;\r\nYvart, the Inspector-General of the Imperial Veterinary Schools;\r\nRenault, Inspector of the Imperial Veterinary Schools; Delafond,\r\nDirector of Alfort College; Bouley, Lassaigne, Baudemont, Doyére, Manny\r\nde Morny, and a few others representing the public. If such a\r\ncommission were occasionally appointed in this country for similar\r\npurposes, how much light would be thrown on subjects of paramount\r\nimportance to the agricultural community!\r\n\r\nConclusions arrived at by the commission are too important to be\r\noverlooked in this connection. The reader must peruse the Report itself,\r\nif he needs to satisfy himself as to the care taken in conducting the\r\ninvestigations: but the foregoing names sufficiently attest the\r\nindisputable nature of the facts alluded to.\r\n\r\nIn instituting its experiments, the commission had in view the solving\r\nof the following questions:--\r\n\r\n_1stly._ Is the epizoötic pleuro-pneumonia of cattle susceptible of\r\nbeing transmitted from diseased to healthy animals by cohabitation?\r\n\r\n_2dly._ In the event of such contagion's existing, would all the animals\r\nbecome affected, or what proportion would resist the disease?\r\n\r\n_3dly._ Amongst the animals attacked by the disease, how many recover,\r\nand under what circumstances? How many succumb?\r\n\r\n_4thly._ Are there any animals of the ox species decidedly free from any\r\nsusceptibility of being affected from the contagion of pleuro-pneumonia?\r\n\r\n_5thly._ Do the animals, which have been once affected by a mild form of\r\nthe disease, enjoy immunity from subsequent attacks?\r\n\r\n_6thly._ Do the animals, which have once been affected by the disease in\r\nits active form, enjoy such immunity?\r\n\r\nTo determine these questions, the commission submitted at different\r\ntimes to the influence of cohabitation with diseased animals forty-six\r\nperfectly healthy ones, chosen from districts in which they had never\r\nbeen exposed to a similar influence.\r\n\r\nOf these forty-six animals, twenty were experimented on at Pomeraye, two\r\nat Charentonneau, thirteen at Alfort, and eleven, in the fourth\r\nexperiment, at Charentonneau.\r\n\r\nOf this number, twenty-one animals resisted the disease when first\r\nsubmitted to the influence of cohabitation, ten suffered slightly, and\r\nfifteen took the disease. Of the fifteen affected, four died, and eleven\r\nrecovered. Consequently, the animals which apparently escaped the\r\ndisease at the first trial amounted to 45.65 per cent., and those\r\naffected to 21.73 per cent. Of these, 23.91 per cent. recovered, and\r\n8.69 per cent. died. But the external appearances in some instances\r\nproved deceptive, and six of the eleven animals of the last experiment,\r\nwhich were regarded as having escaped free, were found, on being\r\ndestroyed, to bear distinct evidence of having been affected. This,\r\ntherefore, modifies the foregoing calculations, and the numbers should\r\nstand thus:--\r\n\r\n15 enjoy immunity,  or  32.61 per cent.\r\n10 indisposed,      \"   21.73    \"\r\n17 animals cured,   \"   36.95    \"\r\n 4 dead,            \"    8.98    \"\r\n\r\nOf the forty-two animals which were exposed in the first experiments at\r\nPomeraye and Charentonneau, and which escaped either without becoming\r\naffected, or recovering, eighteen were submitted to a second trial; and\r\nof these eighteen animals, five had, in the first experiment, suffered\r\nfrom the disease and had recovered; five had now become affected; and\r\nfour had been indisposed. The four animals submitted to the influence\r\nof contagion a third time, had been affected on the occasion of the\r\nfirst trial. None of the eighteen animals contracted the disease during\r\nthese renewed exposures to the influence of contagion.\r\n\r\nFrom the results of these experiments, the commission drew the following\r\nconclusions:--\r\n\r\n_1stly._ The epizoötic pleuro-pneumonia is susceptible of being\r\ntransmitted from diseased to healthy animals by cohabitation.\r\n\r\n_2dly._ All the animals exposed do not take the disease; some suffer\r\nslightly, and others not at all.\r\n\r\n_3dly._ Of the affected animals, some recover and others die.\r\n\r\n_4thly._ The animals, whether slightly or severely affected, possess an\r\nimmunity against subsequent attacks.\r\n\r\nThese are the general conclusions which the commission deemed themselves\r\nauthorized to draw from their experiments. The absolute proportion of\r\nanimals which become affected, or which escape the disease, or of those\r\nwhich die and which recover, as a general rule, cannot be deduced from\r\nthe foregoing experiments, which, for such a purpose, are too limited.\r\nThe commission simply state the numbers resulting from their\r\nexperiments. From these it transpires that forty five of the animals\r\nbecame severely affected with pleuro-pneumonia, and twenty-one per cent.\r\ntook the disease slightly, making the whole sixty-six per cent. which\r\nwere more or less severely attacked. Thirty-four per cent. remained free\r\nfrom any malady. The proportion of animals which re-acquired their\r\nwonted appearance of health amounted to eighty-three per cent., whereas\r\nseventeen per cent. died. Many minor points might be insisted on, but it\r\nis sufficient here to say, that the most careful analysis of all facts\r\nhas proved to practical veterinarians, as well as to experienced\r\nagriculturists, and must prove to all who will calmly and\r\ndispassionately consider the point, that pleuro-pneumonia is\r\npre-eminently an infectious, or contagious disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TWINS.]\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--From the time that an animal is exposed to the contagion to\r\nthe first manifestation of symptoms, a certain period elapses. This is\r\nthe period of incubation. It varies from a fortnight to forty days, or\r\neven several months. The first signs, proving that the animal has been\r\nseized, can scarcely be detected by any but a professional man; though,\r\nif a proprietor of cattle were extremely careful, and had pains-taking\r\nindividuals about his stock, he would invariably notice a slight shiver\r\nas ushering in the disorder, which for several days, even after the\r\nshivering fit, would limit itself to slight interference in breathing,\r\nreadily detected on auscultation. Perhaps a cough might be noticed, and\r\nthat the appetite and milk-secretion diminished. The animal becomes\r\ncostive, and the shivering fits recur. The cough becomes more constant\r\nand oppressive; the pulse full and frequent, usually numbering about\r\neighty per minute at first, and rising to upwards of one hundred. The\r\ntemperature of the body rises, and all the symptoms of acute fever set\r\nin. A moan, or grunt, in the early part of the disease indicates a\r\ndangerous attack, and the _alae nasi_ (cartilages of the nose) rise\r\nspasmodically at each inspiration; the air rushes through the inflamed\r\nwindpipe and bronchial tubes, so as to produce a loud, coarse\r\nrespiratory murmur; and the spasmodic action of the abdominal muscles\r\nindicates the difficulty the animal also experiences in the act of\r\nexpiration. Pressure over the intercostal (between the ribs) spaces, and\r\npressing on the spine, induce the pain so characteristic of pleurisy,\r\nand a deep moan not infrequently follows such an experiment. The eyes\r\nare bloodshot, mouth clammy, skin dry and tightly bound to the\r\nsubcutaneous textures, and the urine is scanty and high-colored.\r\n\r\nUpon auscultation, the characteristic dry, sonorous _râle_ of ordinary\r\nbronchitis may be detected along the windpipe, and in the bronchial\r\ntubes. A loud sound of this description is, not infrequently, detected\r\nat the anterior part of either side of the chest; whilst the respiratory\r\nmurmur is entirely lost, posteriorly, from consolidation of the lungs. A\r\ndecided leathery, frictional sound is detected over a considerable\r\nportion of the thoracic surface. As the disease advances, and gangrene,\r\nwith the production of cavities in the lungs, ensues, loud, cavernous\r\n_râles_ are heard, which are more or less circumscribed, occasionally\r\nattended by a decided metallic noise. When one lobe of the lungs is\r\nalone affected, the morbid sounds are confined to one side, and on the\r\nhealthy side the respiratory murmur is uniformly louder all over.\r\n\r\nBy carefully auscultating diseased cows from day to day, interesting\r\nchanges can be discovered during the animal's lifetime. Frequently, the\r\nabnormal sounds indicate progressive destruction; but, at other times,\r\nportions of the lungs that have been totally impervious to air, become\r\nthe seat of sibilant _râles_, and gradually, a healthy respiratory\r\nmurmur proves that, by absorption of the materials which have been\r\nplugging the tissues of the lungs, resolution is fast advancing. Some\r\nvery remarkable cases of this description have been encountered in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we often find a rapid destruction of the tissues of the\r\nlungs, and speedy dissolution. In other instances, the general symptoms\r\nof hectic, or consumption, attend lingering cases, in which the\r\ntemperature of the body becomes low, and the animal has a dainty\r\nappetite, or refuses all nourishment. It has a discharge from the eyes,\r\nand a fetid, sanious discharge from the nose. Not infrequently, it\r\ncoughs up disorganized lung-tissue and putrid pus. Great prostration,\r\nand, indeed, typhus symptoms, set in. There is a fetid diarrhoea, and\r\nthe animal sinks in the most emaciated state, often dying from\r\nsuffocation, in consequence of the complete destruction of the\r\nrespiratory structures.\r\n\r\n_Post mortem_ appearances.--In acute cases, the cadaverous lesions\r\nchiefly consist in abundant false membranes in the trachea, or windpipe,\r\nand closure of the bronchial tubes by plastic lymph. The air-vesicles\r\nare completely plugged by this material, and very interesting specimens\r\nmay be obtained by careful dissection, in the shape of casts of the\r\nbronchial tubes and air-vesicles, clustered together like bunches of\r\ngrapes. On slicing the lungs in these cases, hepatization is observed,\r\npresenting a very peculiar appearance, which is, in a great measure, due\r\nto the arrangement of the lung-tissue in cattle. The pulmonary lobules\r\nare of a deep-red or brown color, perfectly consolidated, and\r\nintersected or separated, one from the other, by lighter streaks of\r\nyellowish-red lymph, occupying the interlobular, areolar tissue. In the\r\nmore chronic cases, the diseased lobes and lobules are found partly\r\nseparated from the more healthy structures.\r\n\r\nThis occurs from gangrene, and putrefactive changes, or in some\r\ninstances, from the ulcerative process, so constantly observed in the\r\nsegregation of dead from living tissues. Abscesses are not infrequently\r\nfound in different parts of the lungs. Sometimes circumscribed, at\r\nothers connected with bronchial tubes, and not infrequently\r\ncommunicating with the pleural cavity. True empyema is not often seen;\r\nbut, at all times, the adhesions between the costal and visceral pleura\r\nare extensive, and there is much effusion in the chest. In dressed\r\ncarcasses of cows that have been slaughtered from pleuro-pneumonia, even\r\nthough the disease has not been far advanced, it will be found that the\r\nbutcher has carefully scraped the serous membrane off the inner surface\r\nof the ribs, as it would otherwise be impossible for him to give the\r\npleura its healthy, smooth aspect, from the firm manner in which the\r\nabundant false membranes adhere to it. The diseased lungs sometimes\r\nattain inordinate weight. They have been known to weigh as much as sixty\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The veterinary profession is regarded by many who have\r\nsustained heavy losses from pleuro-pneumonia, as deeply ignorant,\r\nbecause its members cannot often cure the disease. Persons forget that\r\nthere are several epidemics which prove equally difficult to manage on\r\nthe part of the physician, such as cholera, yellow fever, etc. The\r\npoison in these contagious, epizoötic diseases is so virulent that the\r\nanimals may be regarded as dead from the moment they are attacked. Its\r\nelimination from the system is impossible, and medicine cannot support\r\nan animal through its tardy, exhausting, and destructive process of\r\nclearing the system of so potent a virus. All antiphlogistic means have\r\nfailed, such as blood-letting and the free use of evacuants.\r\nDerivatives, in the form of mustard-poultices, or more active blisters,\r\nare attended with good results. Stimulants have proved of the greatest\r\nservice; and the late Prof. Tessona, of Turin, strongly recommended,\r\nfrom the very onset of the disease, the administration of strong doses\r\nof quinine. Maffei, of Ferrara, states that he has obtained great\r\nbenefit from the employment of ferruginous tonics and manganese in the\r\nvery acute stage of the malady, supported by alcoholic stimulants.\r\nRecently, the advantages resulting from the use of sulphate of iron,\r\nboth as a preventive and curative, have been exhibited in France. It\r\nwould appear that the most valuable depurative method of treatment yet\r\nresorted to is by the careful use of the Roman bath. Acting, like all\r\nother sudorifics in cases of fever and blood diseases, it carries off by\r\nthe skin much of the poison, without unduly lowering the vital powers.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--The rules laid down in Denmark, and indeed in many other\r\nplaces, appear the most natural for the prevention of the disease. If\r\nthey could be carried out, the disease must necessarily be stopped; but\r\nthere are practical and insuperable difficulties in the way of enforcing\r\nthem. Thus, a Dr. Warneke says, prevention consists in \"the avoidance of\r\ncontagion; the slaughter of infected beasts; the prohibition of keeping\r\ncattle by those whose cattle have been slaughtered, for a space of ten\r\nweeks after the last case occurring; the disinfection of stalls vacated\r\nby slaughtering; the closing of infected places to all passing of\r\ncattle; especial attention to the removal of the dung, and of the\r\nremains of the carcasses of slaughtered beasts; and, finally,\r\nundeviating severity of the law against violators.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Williams, of Hasselt, suggested and carried out, in 1851, the\r\ninoculation of the virus of pleuro-pneumonia, in order to induce a mild\r\nform of the disease in healthy animals, and prevent their decimation by\r\nthe severe attacks due to contagion. He met with much encouragement, and\r\nperhaps more opposition. Didot, Corvini, Ercolani, and many more\r\naccepted Dr. Williams's facts as incontestable, and wrote, advocating\r\nhis method of checking the spread of so destructive a plague.\r\n\r\nThe first able memoir which contested all that has been said in favor of\r\ninoculation, appeared in Turin, and was written by Dr. Riviglio, a\r\nPiedmontese veterinary surgeon. This was supported by the views of many\r\nothers. Prof. Simonds wrote against the plan, and, in 1854, the French\r\ncommission, whose report has been before mentioned, confirmed, in part,\r\nRiviglio's views, though, from the incompleteness of the experiments,\r\nfurther trials were recommended.\r\n\r\nInoculation is performed as follows: A portion of diseased lung is\r\nchosen, and a bistoury or needle made to pierce it so as to become\r\ncharged with the material consolidating the lung, and this is afterward\r\nplunged into any part, but, more particularly, toward the point of the\r\ntail. If operated severely, and higher up, great exudation occurs, which\r\nspreads upward, invades the areolar tissue round the rectum and other\r\npelvic organs, and death soon puts an end to the animal's excruciating\r\nsuffering. If the operation is properly performed with lymph that is not\r\nputrid, and the incisions are not made too deep, the results are limited\r\nto local exudation and swelling, general symptoms of fever, and gradual\r\nrecovery. The most common occurrence is sloughing of the tail; and in\r\nLondon, at the present time, dairies are to be seen in which all the\r\ncows have short-tail stumps.\r\n\r\nDr. Williams and others have gone too far in attempting to describe a\r\nparticular corpuscle as existing in the lymph of pleuro-pneumonia. All\r\nanimal poisons can be alone discovered from their effects. In structure\r\nand chemical constitution, there is no difference, and often the most\r\npotent poisons are simple fluids. The Belgian Commission, appointed to\r\ninvestigate the nature and influence of inoculation for\r\npleuro-pneumonia, very justly expressed an opinion that Dr. Williams had\r\nnot proved that a specific product, distinguished by anatomical\r\ncharacters, and appreciable by the microscope, existed in this disease.\r\n\r\nThe all-important question, \"Is inoculation of service?\" has to the\r\nsatisfaction of most been solved. The Belgian and French commissions,\r\nthe observations of Riviglio, Simond, Herring, and many others, prove\r\nthat a certain degree of preservative influence is derived by the\r\nprocess of inoculation. It does not, however, arrest the progress of the\r\ndisease. It certainly diminishes to some extent--though often very\r\nslightly so--the number of cases, and, particularly, of severe ones.\r\nThis effect has been ascribed to a derivative action, independent of any\r\nspecific influence, and, indeed, similar to that of introducing setons\r\nin the dewlap.\r\n\r\nIn London, some dairymen have considerable faith in inoculation, though\r\nits effect is uncertain, and the manner of its working a mystery. The\r\nbest counsel, in the premises, which can be given to the keeper of dairy\r\nstock is, to select his own animals from healthy herds, and strictly to\r\navoid public markets. In many instances, a faithful observance of these\r\ninjunctions has been sufficient to prevent the invasion of this terrible\r\ndisease. [Gamgee.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of this disease in the United States was not generally\r\nknown until the year 1859, when Mr. Chenery, of Belmont, near Boston,\r\nMassachusetts, imported several cows from Holland, which arrived in the\r\nearly part of the spring of that year. Some of the animals were sick\r\nwhen they arrived, but the true nature of the disease was not at that\r\ntime suspected. Several of them were so bad that they were carried in\r\ntrucks to Mr. Chenery's barn. Some two months passed away before the\r\ncharacter of the disease was discovered.\r\n\r\nUpon the facts becoming known, the citizens of Massachusetts became\r\npanic-stricken, as the disease was rapidly spreading over that State. An\r\nextra session of the Legislature was speedily convened, when a Joint\r\nSpecial Committee was appointed, to adopt and carry out such measures as\r\nin their judgment seemed necessary for the extirpation of this monster,\r\npleuro-pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThe Committee met in the Hall of the House of Representatives, Thursday,\r\nMay, 31, 1860, to receive evidence as to the contagious or infectious\r\ncharacter of the disease, in order to determine concerning the necessity\r\nof legislative action.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker, one of the commissioners appointed by the Governor, made the\r\nfollowing statement: \"The disease was introduced into North Brookfield\r\nfrom Belmont. Mr. Curtis Stoddard, a young man of North Brookfield, went\r\ndown, the very last of June, last year, and purchased three calves of\r\nMr. Chenery, of Belmont. He brought these calves up in the cars to\r\nBrookfield. On their way from the depôt to his house, about five miles,\r\none of the calves was observed to falter, and when he got to his house,\r\nit seemed to be sick, and in two or three days exhibited very great\r\nillness; so much so, that his father came along, and, thinking he could\r\ntake better care of it, took the calf home. He took it to his own barn,\r\nin which there were about forty head of cattle; but it grew no better,\r\nand his son went up and brought it back again to his own house. In about\r\nten days after that, it died. His father, who had had the calf nearly\r\nfour days, in about a fortnight afterward observed that one of his oxen\r\nwas sick, and it grew worse very fast and died. Two weeks after, a\r\nsecond also sickened, and died. Then a third was attacked and died, the\r\ninterval growing wider from the attack of one animal to that of another,\r\nuntil he had lost eight oxen and cows. Young Stoddard lost no animal by\r\nthe infection,--that is, no one died on his hands. Prior to the\r\nappointment of this Commission, about the first of November,--for\r\nreasons independent of this disease, which I don't suppose he then knew\r\nthe nature of,--he sold off his stock. He sold off eleven heifers, or\r\nyoung animals, and retained nine of the most valuable himself; which\r\nshows that he did not then know any thing was the matter with them.\r\n\r\n\"These nine were four oxen, and five young cattle. The four he took to\r\nhis father's, three of the others to his uncle's, and the remaining two\r\nto his father-in-law's; distributing them all among his friends,--which\r\nfurnishes another proof that he did not suppose he was doing any\r\nmischief. He disposed of his herd in that way. From this auction, these\r\neleven animals went in different directions, and wherever they went,\r\nthey scattered the infection. Without a single failure the disease has\r\nfollowed those cattle; in one case, more than two hundred cattle having\r\nbeen infected by one which was sold at Curtis Stoddard's auction, when\r\nhe was entirely ignorant of the disease.\r\n\r\n\"When the commission was appointed, they went and examined his cattle,\r\nand were satisfied that they were diseased,--at least, some of them.\r\nThey examined his father's herd, and found that they were very much\r\ndiseased; and when we came to kill Curtis Stoddard's cattle, seven of\r\nthe nine head were diseased. Two were not condemned, because the law\r\nsays, 'Cattle not appearing to be diseased, shall be appraised.'\r\nNevertheless, it proved that these animals were diseased; so that his\r\nwhole herd was affected.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to Leonard Stoddard's cattle, he lost fourteen of his animals\r\nbefore the commissioners went to his place. They took eighteen more, all\r\nof which were diseased,--most of them very bad cases,--indeed, extreme\r\ncases. That left eight heads, which were not condemned, because not\r\nappearing to be diseased. Here I remark, that when this disease is under\r\nthe shoulder-blade, it cannot be detected by percussion. The physicians\r\ndid not say that the animal was not diseased, but that they did not see\r\nsufficient evidence upon which to condemn. Such animals were to be paid\r\nfor, upon the ground of their not appearing to be diseased.\r\nNevertheless, it is proper to state that the remaining eight which were\r\nnot condemned, were suspected to be diseased, and we told Mr. Stoddard\r\nthat we had the impression that they were diseased, notwithstanding\r\nappearances. He said, 'There is a three-year-old animal that has never\r\nfaltered at all. She has never manifested the slightest disease. If you\r\nwill kill her, and she is diseased, I shall make up my mind that I have\r\nnot a well animal in my stalls.' We killed the animal, and found her to\r\nbe badly diseased.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, the first two herds were all infected by the disease; and in the\r\nlast of Curtis Stoddard's oxen which we killed, we found a cyst in the\r\nlungs of each. One of these lungs is now in this building, never having\r\nbeen cut open, and medical men can see the cyst which it contains. I\r\nhave said in what manner Mr. Curtis Stoddard's cattle spread the\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to Mr. Leonard Stoddard's: in the first place, he kept six or\r\neight oxen which he employed in teaming. He was drawing some lumber, and\r\nstopped over night, with his oxen, at Mr. Needham's. Needham lost his\r\nwhole herd. He lost eight or ten of them, and the rest were in a\r\nterrible condition. Seven or eight more were condemned, and his whole\r\nherd was destroyed, in consequence of Mr. Stoddard's stopping with him\r\nover night. Mr. Stoddard sold an animal to Mr. Woodis of New Braintree.\r\nHe had twenty-three fine cows. It ruined his herd utterly. Seven or\r\neight animals died before the commissioners got there. Mr. L. Stoddard\r\nalso sold a yoke of cattle to Mr. Olmstead, one of his neighbors, who\r\nhad a very good herd. They stayed only five days in his hands, when\r\nthey passed over to Mr. Doane. In these five days they had so infected\r\nhis herd that it was one of the most severe instances of disease that we\r\nhave had. One third were condemned, and another third were passed over\r\nas sound, whether they were so, or not. They did not appear to be\r\ndiseased. The cattle that were passed from Mr. Stoddard through Mr.\r\nOlmstead to Mr. Doane, were loaned by Mr. D. to go to a moving of a\r\nbuilding from Oakham to New Braintree. They were put in with twenty-two\r\nyoke of cattle, and employed a day and a half. It has since been proved\r\nthat the whole of these cattle took the contagion. They belonged to\r\neleven different herds, and of course, each of these herds formed a\r\nfocus from which the disease spread. Now, in these two ways the disease\r\nhas spread in different directions.\r\n\r\n\"But, when the commissioners first commenced, they had no idea that the\r\ndisease extended further than those herds in which there were animals\r\nsick. Hence, their ideas and the ideas of those who petitioned for the\r\nlaw, did not extend at all to so large a number of herds as have since\r\nbeen proved to be diseased, because they only judged of those who\r\nmanifested disease. As soon as we began in that circle, we found a\r\nsecond circle of infection, and another outside of that; and by that\r\ntime it had branched off in various directions to various towns. It\r\nassumed such proportions that it was very evident that the commissioners\r\nhad not the funds to perform the operations required by the law. The law\r\nconfines the commissioners to one operation,--killing and burying. No\r\ndiscretionary power is given at all. The commissioners became entirely\r\ndissatisfied with that condition of things, because other measures\r\nbesides merely killing and burying, are quite as necessary and\r\nimportant. When they arrived at that point and discovered to what extent\r\nthe infection had spread, they stopped killing the herds, and I believe\r\nthere has not been a herd killed for twenty days.\r\n\r\n\"The policy was then changed to circumscribing the disease, by isolating\r\nthe herds just as fast as possible and as surely as possible. A man's\r\nherd has been exposed. There is no other way than to go and examine it,\r\nand take the diseased animals away. Then he knows the animals are\r\ndiseased, and his neighbors know it. That has been the business of the\r\ncommissioners for the last twenty days; and the facts that they have no\r\ndiscretionary power whatever, and that they were entirely circumscribed\r\nin their means, and that it was hard for the farmers to lose their stock\r\nand not be paid for it,--induced them to petition the Governor, in\r\nconnection with the Board of Agriculture, for the calling of a session\r\nof the Legislature, to take measures for the extinction of the disease.\"\r\n\r\nIn response to a question, \"Whether any animals that had once been\r\naffected, had afterward recovered?\"--the same gentleman stated that\r\ninstances had occurred where cattle had been sick twice, and had,\r\napparently, fully recovered; they ruminated readily, and were gaining\r\nflesh. Upon examination, however, they were pronounced diseased, and,\r\nwhen killed, both lungs were found in a hopeless case, very badly\r\ndiseased.\r\n\r\nDr. George B. Loring, another of the commissioners, stated that eight\r\nhundred and forty-two head of cattle had, at that time, been killed, and\r\nthat, from a careful estimate, there still remained one thousand head,\r\nwhich should either be killed, or isolated for such a length of time as\r\nshould establish the fact that they had no disease about them. Twenty\r\nthousand dollars and upwards had already been appraised as the value of\r\nthe cattle then killed.\r\n\r\nAs to disinfecting measures, the farmers who had lost cattle were\r\nrequested to whitewash their barns thoroughly, and some tons of a\r\ndisinfecting powder were purchased for the advantage of the persons who\r\nwished to use it. An early application was advised, that the barns might\r\nbe in readiness for hay the then coming season.\r\n\r\nThe practice adopted by the commissioners was, to appraise the cattle\r\nwhenever a herd was found which had been exposed, and a surgeon was\r\nappointed to pass judgment upon the number of diseased animals. After\r\nthat judgment, the remaining animals that were pronounced sound were\r\nkilled and passed to the credit of the owner, after an appraisement made\r\nby these persons. The fair market-prices were paid, averaging about\r\nthirty-three dollars a head. At the time of the meeting of the\r\ncommittee, some seventy cattle had died of the disease.\r\n\r\nAn examination was made of some of the animals killed, and the following\r\nfacts obtained:--\r\n\r\nCase 1.--This cow had been sick for nineteen days; was feeble, without\r\nmuch appetite, with diarrhoea, cough, shortness of breathing, hair\r\nstaring, etc. Percussion dull over the whole of the left side of the\r\nchest; respiration weak. Killed by authority. Several gallons of serum\r\nwere found in the left side of the chest; a thick, furzy deposit of\r\nlymph over all the _pleura-costalis_. This lymph was an inch in\r\nthickness, resembling the velvety part of tripe, and quite firm. There\r\nwas a firm deposit of lymph in the whole left lung, but more especially\r\nat its base, with strong adhesions to the diaphragm and\r\n_pleura-costalis_ near the spine. The lung was hard and brittle, like\r\nliver, near its base. No pus. Right lung and right side of chest\r\nhealthy.\r\n\r\nCase 2.--This cow was taken very sick, January 30th. In fourteen days,\r\nshe began to get better. April 12th, she is gaining flesh, breathes\r\nwell, hair healthy, gives ten quarts of milk a day, and in all other\r\nrespects bids fair for a healthy animal hereafter, except a slight\r\ncough. Percussion dull over base of the left lung, near the spine, and\r\nrespiration feeble in the same regions.\r\n\r\nAutopsy.--Left lung strongly adherent to diaphragm and costal pleura;\r\nthe long adhesions well smoothed off; _pleura-costalis_ shining and\r\nhealthy. Also, the surface of the lung, when there were no adhesions,\r\nsound and right; all the lung white, and free for the entrance of air,\r\nexcept the base, in which was a cyst containing a pint or two of pus.\r\nLoose in this pus was a hard mass, as large as a two-quart measure,\r\nlooking like marble; when cut through its centre, it appeared like the\r\nbrittle, hardened lining in case 1. It appeared as though a piece of\r\nlung had been detached by suppuration and enclosed in an air-tight cyst,\r\nby which decomposition was prevented. The other lung and the chest were\r\nsound. It is to be inferred, as there were adhesions, that there had\r\nbeen pleurisy and deposit of lymph and serum, as in case 1, and that\r\nNature had commenced the cure by absorbing the serum from the chest, and\r\nthe lymph from the free pleural surface, and smoothed off every thing to\r\na good working condition. The lump in the cyst was brittle and\r\nirregular on its surface, as though it was dissolving in the pus. No\r\ngood reason can be given why Nature should not consummate the work which\r\nshe had so wisely begun.\r\n\r\nCase 3.--This cow had been sick fourteen days; was coughing and\r\nbreathing badly; percussion dull over both chests and respiration\r\nfeeble. Killed.\r\n\r\nAutopsy.--Both chests filled with water; deposits of lymph over all the\r\n_pleura-costalis_, presenting the same velvety, furzy appearance as in\r\nCase 1. Both lungs were hardened at the base, and the left throughout\r\nits whole extent, and firmly adherent to diaphragm and costal pleura,\r\nnear the spine. The right lung had nearly one-third of its substance in\r\na condition for the entrance of air; but this portion, even, was so\r\ncompressed with the water, that a few hours longer would have terminated\r\nthe case fatally without State aid. This case had not proceeded far\r\nenough for the formation of the cyst or pus.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Needham's herd, about twenty-eight days intervened between the\r\nfirst and second case of disease, instead of about fourteen, as in Mr.\r\nOlmstead's.\r\n\r\nCase 4.--A nice heifer, in fair condition, eating well, only having a\r\nslight cough. Percussion dull over base of the left lung.\r\n\r\nAutopsy.--Base of left lung adherent to diaphragm and costal pleura;\r\nlung hardened. On cutting into base, found ulceration and a head of\r\nTimothy grass, four or five inches long. Animal in every other way well.\r\n\r\nCase 5.--This cow was taken, January 1st, with a cough, difficulty of\r\nbreathing, and the other symptoms of the disease, and continued sick\r\ntill March 1st. On taking her out, April 12th, to be slaughtered, she\r\ncapered, stuck up her tail, snuffed, and snorted, showing all the signs\r\nof feeling well and vigorous.\r\n\r\nAutopsy.--Right lung firmly adherent to diaphragm and costal pleura,\r\nnear the spine. Base of lung hardened, containing a cyst with a large\r\nlump, of the size of a two-quart measure, floating in pus; outside of\r\nthe lump was of a dirty yellow-white, irregular, brittle, and cheesy;\r\nthe inside mottled, or divided into irregular squares; red like muscle,\r\nand breaking under the finger, like liver. Costal pleura smooth,\r\nshining; adhesions where there was motion; card-like and polished; no\r\nserum; lung apparently performing its functions well, except for a short\r\ndistance above the air-tight cyst, where it was still hardened. It would\r\nseem as though Nature was intending to dissolve this lump, and carry it\r\noff by absorption. She knows how, and would have done it, in the opinion\r\nof the writer, had she been allowed sufficient time.\r\n\r\nCase 6.--Was taken December 18th, and was very sick; in three weeks she\r\nwas well, except a cough, quite severe, and so continued till about the\r\nfirst of March, when she coughed harder and grew worse till seven days\r\nbefore she was killed, April 12th, when she brought forth a calf, and\r\nthen commenced improving again.\r\n\r\nAutopsy.--Right lung adherent to diaphragm and costal pleura. At its\r\nbase, was a flabby, fluctuating cyst. In cutting into it, the lump was\r\nfound to be breaking up by decomposition, and scenting badly. Every\r\nthing else normal. Was not the cyst broken through by some accident,\r\nthus letting in the air, when she grew worse? Would she not, probably,\r\nhave overcome this disagreeable accident, and recovered, in spite of it?\r\nThis cow's hair did not look well, as did that of those in which the\r\ncyst was air-tight; but still she was beginning to eat well again, and\r\nappeared in a tolerable way for recovery.\r\n\r\nCase 7.--This heifer had coughed slightly for six weeks, but the owner\r\nsaid he thought no one going into his herd would notice that any thing\r\nwas the matter with her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RURAL SCENE.]\r\n\r\nAutopsy.--Slight adhesions of lung to diaphragm. Near these adhesions\r\nare small cysts, of the size of a walnut, containing pus and cheesy\r\nmatter; about the cysts a little way the lung was hardened, say for half\r\nan inch. There were several cysts, and they appeared as though the\r\ninflammation attacked only the different lobes of the lungs, leaving\r\nothers healthy between,--Nature throwing out coagulable lymph around the\r\ndiseased lobe, and forming thereby an air-tight cyst, cutting around the\r\ndiseased lobe by suppuration, so that it could be carried off by\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nIn the herd to which this animal belonged, nine days after the first cow\r\ndied, the second case occurred. First cow was sick five weeks. The time\r\nof incubation could not have been over six weeks,--probably not over\r\nthree weeks. Of these cows, one improved in eight weeks, the other in\r\nthree weeks.\r\n\r\nCase 8.--This cow had been sick three weeks. Killed.\r\n\r\nAutopsy.--Large quantities of serum in left chest; lung adherent, and\r\nhardened at base. On cutting into the hardened lung, one side of the\r\nlump was found separated from the lung, with pus between the lines of\r\nseparation, and the forming coat of the cyst outside of the pus; the\r\nother side of the lump was part and parcel of the hardened lung which\r\nhad not yet had time to commence separation. The costal pleura was\r\ncovered with organized lymph to the thickness of an inch, with the usual\r\ncharacteristics. The right chest contained a small quantity of serum,\r\nand had several small, hardened red spots in that lung, with some\r\ntender, weak adhesions; but most of the right lung was healthy.\r\n\r\nCase 9.--Sick four weeks. Killed.\r\n\r\nAutopsy.--Right lung hardened at base; adherent to diaphragm and costal\r\npleura; lump separated on one side only. Cyst beginning to form, outside\r\nof separation; pus between cyst and lump, but in a very small quantity.\r\n\r\nThese two cases settle the character of the lump, and the manner of the\r\nformation of the cyst; the lump being lung and lymph, cut out by\r\nsuppuration,--the cyst being organized, smoothed off by suppuration,\r\nfriction, etc.\r\n\r\nCase 10.--Killed. Hair looked badly; but the cow, it was said, ate, and\r\nappeared well. This case, however, occurred in a herd, of which no\r\nreliable information, in detail, could be procured.\r\n\r\nAutopsy.--Base of lung hardened, adherent to diaphragm; containing a\r\ncyst, in which was a lump, of the size of a quart measure, but little\r\npus. This lump had air-tubes running through it, which were not yet cut\r\noff by suppuration; and in one place, the cyst was perforated by a\r\nbronchial tube, letting in the external air to the lump, which was\r\nundergoing disorganization, and swelling badly. When cut into, it did\r\nnot present the red, mottled, organized appearance of those cases with\r\nair-tight cysts.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of other cases were examined, but these ten present all\r\nthe different phases. One or two cases are needed of an early stage of\r\nthe disease, to settle the point, whether, in all cases, the primary\r\ndisease is lung fever, and the pleurisy a continuation, merely, of the\r\nprimary disease; together with some six or eight cases, during five,\r\nsix, seven, eight months from attack, and so on till entire, final\r\nrecovery. Some cases were sick almost a year since, and are now\r\napparently quite well; perhaps all the lump and pus are not yet gone.\r\nMany practitioners think that no severe case will ever recover, and some\r\nthink that none ever get entirely well. Others, however, can see no\r\nreason why, as a general rule, all single cases should not recover, and\r\nall double cases die.\r\n\r\nThe disease was the most fatal in Mr. Chenery's (the original) herd,\r\nalthough it was the best-fed and the warmest-stabled. He attributed the\r\nfatality, in part, to a want of sufficient ventilation. The other herds,\r\nin which all the fatal cases occurred in two hours, consisted,\r\noriginally, one of forty-eight head, of which thirteen died, or were\r\nkilled, to prevent certain death; of twenty-three head, of which seven\r\ndied; of twenty-two head, of which eight died; of twenty-two head, of\r\nwhich eight also died; and of twenty-one head, of which four died. A\r\nlittle less than thirty per cent., therefore, of these herds died.\r\n\r\nThis estimate excludes the calves. Most of the cows which had not calved\r\nbefore being attacked, lost their calves prematurely. The probable time\r\nof incubation, as deduced from those Massachusetts cases, is from two to\r\nthree weeks; of propagation, about the same time; the acute stage of the\r\ndisease lasting about three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe author's attention was first directed to this disease, upon its\r\nappearance in Camden and Gloucester counties, New Jersey, in the year\r\n1859, at about the same time it made its advent in Massachusetts. The\r\nsingularity of this coincidence inclined him for the time to regard the\r\ndisease as an epizoötic--having its origin in some peculiar condition of\r\nthe atmosphere--rather than as a contagious, or infectious disease,\r\nwhich position was at that time assumed by him.\r\n\r\nThis opinion was strengthened by the fact, that no case occurring in New\r\nJersey could be traced to a Massachusetts origin, in which State it was\r\nclaimed that the disease never had existed in this country previous to\r\nits introduction there. It was, therefore, denied by the veterinary\r\nsurgeons in the Eastern States, that the disease in New Jersey was the\r\ntrue European pleuro-pneumonia, but it was called by them the swill-milk\r\ndisease of New York City, and it was assigned an origin in the\r\ndistillery cow-houses in Brooklyn and Williamsburg.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 it found its way across the Delaware River into Philadelphia,\r\nspreading very rapidly in all directions, particularly in the southern\r\nsection of the county, known as The Neck,--many of the dairymen losing\r\nfrom one third to one half of their herds by its devastating influence.\r\nIn order to save themselves--in part, at least--from this heavy loss,\r\nmany of them, upon the first indications of the malady, sent their\r\nanimals to the butcher, to be slaughtered for beef. In 1861 the disease\r\nfound its way into Delaware, where its ravages were severely felt. So\r\nsoon, however, as it became known that the disease was infectious or\r\ncontagious, an effort was made to trace it to its starting-point; but,\r\nin consequence of the unwillingness of dairymen to communicate the fact\r\nthat their herds were affected with pleuro-pneumonia, all efforts proved\r\nfruitless. In 1860 the disease found its way up the Delaware to\r\nRiverton, a short distance above the city of Philadelphia. A\r\ncattle-dealer, named Ward, turned some cattle into a lot, adjoining\r\nwhich several others were grazing. The residents of this place are\r\nchiefly the families of gentlemen doing business in the city, many of\r\nwhom lost their favorite animals from this destructive malady.\r\n\r\nThe first case occurring at this place, to which the author's attention\r\nwas called, was a cow belonging to Mr. D. Parrish, which had been\r\nexposed by coming in contact with Ward's cattle, had sickened, and died.\r\nAn anxiety having been manifested to ascertain the cause of the death,\r\nthe author made an examination of the animal, which, upon dissection,\r\nproved the disease to be a genuine case of the so-called\r\npleuro-pneumonia. This examination was made August 20th, 1860, at the\r\ntime of the Massachusetts excitement. Two cows, belonging to Mr. Rose,\r\nof the same place, had been exposed, and both had taken the disease.\r\nHis attention having been called to them, he placed them under the\r\nauthor's treatment, and by the use of diffusible stimulants and tonics,\r\none of these animals recovered, while the other was slaughtered for an\r\nexamination, which revealed all the morbid conditions so characteristic\r\nof this disease.\r\n\r\nThe next case was a cow belonging to Mr. G. H. Roach, of the same place,\r\nwhich had been grazing in a lot adjoining that of Mr. Parrish. This cow\r\nwas killed in the presence of Charles Wood, V.S., of Boston, Mass., and\r\nArthur S. Copeman, of Utica, N. Y., who was one of a committee appointed\r\nby the New York State Agricultural Society for the purpose of\r\ninvestigating the disease. Both of these gentlemen having witnessed the\r\ndisease in-all its forms, as it appeared in Massachusetts, were the\r\nfirst to identify this case with those in that State.\r\n\r\nUpon opening the cow, the left lung was found to be completely\r\nconsolidated, and adhered to the left side, presenting the appearance\r\nusual in such cases. As she was with calf, the lungs of the foetus\r\nwere examined, disclosing a beautiful state of red hepatization.\r\n\r\nThe author's attention was next called to the herd of Mr. Lippincott, a\r\nfarmer in the neighborhood, who had lost several cattle by the disease;\r\nbut as he had been persuaded that treatment was useless, he abandoned\r\nthe idea of attempting to save his stock in that way. From Riverton it\r\nsoon spread to Burlington, some ten miles farther up the river, where it\r\ncarried off large numbers of valuable cattle, and it continued in\r\nexistence in that neighborhood for some time.\r\n\r\nThe disease was not then confined to these localities alone, but has\r\nspread over a large extent of country,--and that, too, prior to its\r\nappearance in Massachusetts, as will be shown by extracts from the\r\nfollowing letters, published in the _Country Gentleman_:--\r\n\r\n\"We have a disease among the cattle here, I will class it under these\r\nnames,--congestion of the lungs, terminating with consumption, or dropsy\r\nof the chest. Now, I have treated two cases; one five years since, as\r\ncongestion,--and the first is still able to eat her allowance, and give\r\na couple of pails of milk a day,--and the other, quite recently. The\r\ngreat terror of this disease is, that it is not taken in its first\r\nstages, which are the same in the cow as in the man--a difficulty in\r\nbreathing, which, if not speedily relieved, terminates in consumption or\r\ndropsy. I have no doubt that consumption is contagious; but is that a\r\nreason why every one taken with congestion should be killed to check the\r\nspread of consumption? So I should reason, if I had pleuro-pneumonia in\r\nmy drove of cattle.                                      J. BALDWIN.\r\n\r\n     \"NEWARK, N. J., June 11, 1860.\"\r\n\r\n\"I notice that a good deal of alarm is felt in different parts of the\r\ncountry about what is called the cattle-disease.\r\n\r\n\"From the diagnosis given in the papers, I have no doubt this is\r\npleuro-pneumonia, with which I had some acquaintance a few years ago. If\r\nit is the same, my observation and experience may be of some service to\r\nthose suffering now.\r\n\r\n\"It was introduced into my stock, in the fall of 1853, by one of my own\r\ncows, which, in the spring of that year, I had sent down to my brother\r\nin Brooklyn, to be used during the summer for milk. She was kept\r\nentirely isolated through out the summer, and in November was sent up\r\nby the boat. There were no other cattle on the boat at the time, nor\r\ncould I learn that she had come in contact with any in passing through\r\nthe streets on her way to the boat; and she certainly did not, after\r\nleaving it, until she mingled with her old companions, all of whom were\r\nthen, and long afterward, perfectly well. After she had been home about\r\ntwo weeks, we noticed that her appetite failed, and her milk fell off:\r\nshe seemed dull and stupid, stood with her head down, and manifested a\r\nconsiderable degree of languor.\r\n\r\n\"Soon her breathing became somewhat hurried, and with a decided catch in\r\nit; she ground her teeth; continued standing, or, if she lay down, it\r\nwas only to jump up again instantly. Her cough increased, and so, too, a\r\npurulent and, bloody discharge from her nostrils and mouth. The\r\nexcrement was fetid, black, and hard.\r\n\r\n\"In this case, we twice administered half a pound of Epsom-salts, and\r\nafterward, a bottle of castor-oil. Very little, but a temporary effect\r\nwas produced by these doses.\r\n\r\n\"The symptoms all increased in intensity; strength diminished; limbs\r\ndrawn together; belly tucked up, etc.; until the eight day, when she\r\npartly lay, and partly fell down, and never rose again.\r\n\r\n\"In a _post-mortem_ examination, the lungs were gorged with black, fetid\r\nblood; the substance of them thickened and pulpy. The pleura and\r\ndiaphragm also showed a good deal of disease and some adhesion. This\r\ncow, on her arrival here, was put in her usual place in the stable,\r\nbetween others. She remained there for two or three days after she was\r\ntaken sick, before we removed her to the hospital.\r\n\r\n\"In about three weeks from the time she died, one and then the other of\r\nthose standing on either side of her were attacked in the same way, and\r\nwith but two days between. This, certainly, looks very much like\r\ncontagion; but my attention had not before been called to this\r\nparticular disease, and to suppose inflammation or congestion of the\r\nlungs contagious was so opposed to my preconceived notions, that I did\r\nnot even then admit it; and these animals were suffered to remain with\r\nthe others until their own comfort seemed to require the greater liberty\r\nof open pens.\r\n\r\n\"One of them was early and copiously bled twice, while Epsom-salts were\r\nadministered, both by the stomach and with the injective-pump. The other\r\nwe endeavored to keep nauseated with ipecacuanha, and the same time to\r\nkeep her bowels open by cathartic medicine. All proved to be of no\r\navail. They both died,--the one in ten, the other in thirteen days.\r\nBefore these died, however, others were taken sick. And thus, later, I\r\nhad eight sick at one time.\r\n\r\n\"The leading symptoms in all were the same, with minor differences; and\r\nso, too, was the appearance after death, on examination.\r\n\r\n\"Of all that were taken sick (sixteen) but two recovered; and they were\r\namong those we did the least for, after we had become discouraged about\r\ntrying to cure them. In all the last cases we made no effort at all, but\r\nto keep them as comfortable as we could. In one case, the acute\r\ncharacter of the disease changed to chronic, and the animal lived six or\r\neight weeks, until the whole texture of the lungs had become destroyed.\r\nShe had become much emaciated, and finally died with the ordinary\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n\"At the time the first case appeared, I had a herd of thirty-one\r\nanimals, all valuable Ayrshires, in fine condition and healthy. In all\r\nthe first cases, I had a veterinary surgeon of considerable celebrity\r\nand experience, and every ordinary approved method of treatment was\r\nresorted to and persevered in. The last cases--as before intimated--we\r\nonly strove to make comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"After I had paid the third or fourth forfeit, I began to awake up to\r\nthe idea that the disease was, in a high degree, contagious, whether I\r\nwould have it so or not; and that my future security was in prevention,\r\nand not in remedy. I therefore separated all the remaining animals; in\r\nno instance having more than two together, and generally but one in a\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"All were removed from the infected stalls, and put into quarantine.\r\nIsolated cases continued to occur after this for some weeks, but the\r\nspread of the disease was stayed; nor did a single case occur after\r\nthis, which we did not think we traced directly to previous contact.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to account for the first case of which I have spoken.\r\nBut, as the cow in that case was put into a sale-stable in New York\r\nwhile waiting for the boat,--though there were no cattle then\r\npresent,--yet I have supposed it not unlikely that diseased animals had\r\nbeen there, and had left the seeds of the disease.\r\n\r\n\"But, account for this case as we may,--and I have no doubt it is\r\nsometimes spontaneous,--I feel convinced it is very highly contagious;\r\nand that the only safety to a herd into which it has been introduced, is\r\nin complete isolation,--and in this I feel as convinced that there is\r\nsafety. My cattle were not suffered to return to the barnyard or to any\r\npart of the cattle-barns, except as invalids were sent to 'the hospital'\r\nto die, until late the next fall, _i.e._, the fall of 1854. In the mean\r\ntime, the hay and straw had all been removed; the stables, stalls, cribs\r\nand all thoroughly scrubbed with ashes and water, fumigated, and white\r\nwashed with quicklime. I have had no case since, and am persuaded I\r\nshould have avoided most of those I had before, if I had reasonably\r\nadmitted the evidence of my senses in the second and third cases.\r\n                                             E. P. PRENTICE.\r\n     MOUNT HOPE, June 14th, 1860.\"\r\n\r\nThe author's experience with the disease, during the last year in New\r\nJersey, proves the efficacy of remedial agents when applied in the early\r\nstages of the disease. Late in the spring of 1861, Mr. J. E. Hancock, of\r\nBurlington County (residing near Columbus, N. J.), purchased some cattle\r\nin the Philadelphia market, which, after they were driven home, he\r\nturned in with his other stock. Soon after this purchase, one of the\r\nanimals sickened and died. This was in August; after which time Mr. H.\r\nlost eight cows,--having, at the time of the death of the last animal,\r\nsome five others sick with the same disorder.\r\n\r\nThe author was called in, December 8th, 1861, and the five animals then\r\nplaced under his treatment. On the 12th of December, in the same year,\r\none of these cows, at his suggestion, was killed, which, upon the\r\n_post-mortem_ examination, beautifully illustrated the character of the\r\ndisease. The right lung was comparatively healthy; the left one\r\ncompletely hepatized, or consolidated, and so enlarged as to fill up the\r\nleft cavity of the chest to it's utmost capacity. This lung weighed\r\nthirty pounds. There was no effusion in the chest, but there was\r\nconsiderable adhesion of the _pleura-costalis_ and _pleura-pulmonalis_.\r\nAll the other tissues appeared to be healthy.\r\n\r\nTo the remaining animals, was administered the following: aqua ammonia,\r\nthree drachms; nitric ether, one ounce; pulverized gentian-root, half an\r\nounce; mixed with one quart of water, and drenched three times a day.\r\nThe last thing at night was given a teaspoonful of phosphate of lime,\r\nmixed in a little feed, or in gruel. Setons, or rowels, in the dewlap\r\nare also very beneficial. Under this treatment they all did well.\r\n\r\nSoon after the introduction of the disease into this herd, it found its\r\nway to the herd of William Hancock, a brother of the former gentleman,\r\nwho had an adjoining farm. In this herd one cow died, and the disease\r\nwas found by the author developed in four more cows and two oxen, all of\r\nwhich--with a single exception--did well under the above treatment. The\r\ndisease afterward showed itself in the herd of John Pope, half a mile\r\ndistant, who lost nine animals by it.\r\n\r\nThursday, December 19th, was selected for the purpose of making an\r\nexamination of the Hancock herds; but, after some ten or twelve animals\r\nhad been examined and all pronounced tainted with the disease, the\r\nowners concluded to stop the investigation, expressing themselves\r\ndissatisfied with the result, as not one of the animals examined had\r\nshown any symptoms of disease. In order to convince them of the\r\ncorrectness of the diagnosis, a cow was selected and destroyed, which\r\nthe Hancocks believed to be in perfect health. Upon opening the animal,\r\nseveral small patches of hepatized lung were brought into view. Upon\r\nmaking a longitudinal section of the lump, as both were involved, they\r\npresented a red, speckled appearance. All the other tissues were\r\nhealthy. The symptoms in these cases were quite different from any which\r\nhad been previously seen in an experience of three years with the\r\ndisease in and about Philadelphia, inasmuch as they were not preceded by\r\ncough; in fact, cough did not appear in many of the animals at any time\r\nduring the progress of the disease. The animals looked, ate, and milked\r\nwell, previously to the development of the disease, so that the owners\r\nwere thrown completely off their guard by these deceptive symptoms of\r\nhealth. Knowing the uncertain character of this disease, and wishing to\r\nstay its ravages, a suggestion was made by the author as to the\r\npropriety of having the entire herd killed for beef. This was done the\r\nmore readily, as the sale of the meat is legalized in Europe, it being\r\nregarded as uninjured, and therefore wholesome meat. This suggestion was\r\nacted upon, and thus these two farms were rid of this dreadful scourge\r\nat one blow.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Gaskill, of Mount Holly, N. J., purchased a cow from one of the\r\nHancocks, for his own family use, which was sent to Mr. Frank\r\nLippincott's to pasture and turned in with Mr. L.'s own herd. Soon\r\nafter, this cow sickened and died. This was soon followed by the loss of\r\nsix of Mr. L.'s own cattle,--three oxen, two cows, and one steer. From\r\nthis herd, it was communicated to the Widow Lippincott's, who occupied a\r\nneighboring farm; as also to Mr. Cleavenger's, who lost four animals;\r\nand to Mr. Smith's, who had, at one time, seven animals sick; and from\r\nCleavenger's to Noaknuts, who lost two cows. Some two or three cows,\r\nbelonging to Mr. Logan, in the same neighborhood, got upon the road and\r\nbroke into Mr. Lippincott's pasture, mixing with his herd. As soon as\r\nMr. Logan was informed of the fact, he isolated these cows by enclosing\r\nthem in a pen at some distance from his other cattle; but they managed\r\nto break out, and mingled with his other stock. It could scarcely be\r\nexpected that his herd could escape the disease, considering the\r\nexposure to which they had been subjected. The disease manifested itself\r\nin the herds of several other farmers in the country, but space will not\r\nallow a more extended notice of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe treatment which has been found most successful in this country is as\r\nfollows, all of which has been tested by the author upon various\r\noccasions: In the acute, inflammatory stage of the disease, give ten\r\ndrops of Flemming's tincture of aconite in water, every four hours,\r\nuntil a change takes place; follow this with aqua ammonia, three\r\ndrachms; nitric ether, one ounce; pulverized gentian-root, one half an\r\nounce; water, one quart. Drench three times a day, and give, late in the\r\nevening, a tablespoonful of phosphate of lime, in a little feed, or\r\ndrench with gruel. Put setons, or rowels in the dewlap, so as to have a\r\ndependent opening.\r\n\r\nThis course has been found very advantageous. Or, the following will be\r\nfound quite satisfactory; nitrate of potash, two drachms; camphor, half\r\na drachm; tartrate of antimony, half a drachm; mix, and give in a little\r\ngruel, night and morning. Or, the following: Glauber-salts, four ounces;\r\nwater, one pint; give twice a day. A gill of cold-drawn castor-oil,\r\nadded to the above, would be beneficial. Continue until the bowels are\r\nfreely opened. The following has also been found efficacious: sulphate\r\nof magnesia, eight ounces; nitrate of potash and pulverized Jamaica\r\nginger-root, of each one ounce. Repeat as often as may be required.\r\nApply externally the following ointment to the sides; biniodide of\r\nmercury, four drachms; castor-oil, half an ounce; lard, four ounces; mix\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nPreventive measures.--1st. The complete isolation of all herds in which\r\nthe disease has made its appearance. 2d. Such animals as show symptoms\r\nof the disease should be placed under proper treatment. 3d. In England,\r\nit is recommended that animals recovering from the disease should be\r\nfattened and slaughtered for beef, as they are not safe even after their\r\napparent recovery. 4th. All animals beyond medical treatment should be\r\nkilled and buried; recompense in part, at least, being made to the\r\nowners. 5th. No animal, healthy or diseased, should be allowed to run at\r\nlarge upon the public highway so long as the disease may exist in its\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKING IT EASILY.]\r\n\r\nThe united action of all those interested would soon rid the country of\r\na disease which has smitten all Europe.\r\n\r\nThe author takes this occasion to acknowledge the receipt of two very\r\nably written articles upon this subject, which, in consequence of their\r\nlength and the comparatively limited space allotted, he is reluctantly\r\ncompelled to omit. One is from the pen of R. McClure, V.S., and the\r\nother from Isaiah Michener, V.S. For the benefit his readers, however,\r\nhe desires to make a single extract from the last-named communication,\r\nwithout being considered as endorsing the opinion advanced therein:--\r\n\r\n\"I am inclined to favor the hypothesis that pleuro-pneumonia is produced\r\nby animalculæ, and that these enter the lungs by myriads, and thereby\r\nset up irritation and inflammation, which lead to all the phenomena and\r\npathological conditions which are to be found upon dissection. This is\r\nmy opinion of the cause of the malignant pleuro-pneumonia which has\r\nexisted in the United States for the last seven years.\"\r\n\r\nAfter writing the foregoing, the author was informed that this disease\r\nhad made its appearance in Mr. Logan's herd, already mentioned as\r\nexposed. He was called to visit the herd of Mr. G. Satterthwaite, who\r\nlikewise lost two cows, and had two cows and a calf sick at the time of\r\nsending for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\nThere are two conditions of the lungs known as pneumonia,--one, the\r\ninflammatory, and the other, the congestive stage. The former may follow\r\nan attack of bronchitis, or it may have a spontaneous origin. The\r\ncongestive is generally the result of cold suddenly applied to an\r\noverheated animal, causing a determination of blood to the lungs, which\r\nsometimes causes death by suffocation.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The disease is preceded by a shivering fit; dry skin;\r\nstaring coat; clammy mouth; short cough; Schneiderian membrane (of the\r\nnose) very much reddened; respiration hurried or laborious. In the\r\ncongestive stage, upon applying the ear to the sides, no sound will be\r\ndetected; While in the inflammatory stage, a crackling or crepitating\r\nsound will be distinctively heard.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In the congestive stage, plenty of pure air will be\r\nnecessary. Bleed freely; and give in drench one pound of Glauber-salts,\r\nwith two drachms of Jamaica ginger. Nothing more will be required by way\r\nof treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the inflammatory stage, bleeding should seldom be resorted to, except\r\nwhere the animal is in full condition. Apply the following blister to\r\nthe sides, well rubbed in: oil of turpentine, one ounce; croton-oil,\r\ntwelve drops; aqua ammonia, half an ounce; linseed-oil, four ounces; mix\r\nall together. Give internally one pound of salts in drench, and follow\r\nwith one of the following powders every four hours: nitrate of potash,\r\none ounce; tartrate of antimony and pulverized digitalis leaves, of\r\neach, one drachm; mix all together, and divide into eight powders. Or\r\nthe following may be given with equal advantage: nitrate of potash, one\r\nand a half ounces; nitrate of soda, six ounces; mix, and divide into six\r\npowders; one to be given in wash or gruel every six hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTRUSION OF THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nThis sometimes occurs during the throes in difficult cases of\r\nparturition in cows, and the aid of a skillful veterinary surgeon is\r\nrequisite to replace the inverted bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUERPERAL FEVER.\r\n\r\nThis disease--milk fever, or dropping after calving--rarely occurs until\r\nthe animal has attained mature age. The first symptoms make their\r\nappearance in from one to five or six days after parturition. It appears\r\nto be a total suspension of nervous function, independent of\r\ninflammatory action, which is suddenly developed, and, in favorable\r\ncases, as suddenly disappears. It is called dropping after calving, from\r\nits following the parturient state.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Tremor of hind legs; a staggering gait, which soon\r\nterminates in loss of power in the hind limbs; pulse rises to sixty or\r\neighty per minute; milk diminishing in quantity as the disease\r\nprogresses; the animal soon goes down, and is unable to rise, moans\r\npiteously; eyes set in the head; general stupor; and slow respiration.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This disease, though generally regarded as a febrile\r\ndisorder, will not yield to the general practice of taking blood, as a\r\nlarge majority of the cases so treated die. The bowels must be opened,\r\nbut the veins never. Give Epsom-salts, one pound; Jamaica ginger, two\r\nounces; dissolve in warm water, one quart, and drench. The author\r\nusually gives with good effect, some five or six hours after the salts,\r\ntwo ounces of nitric ether and one ounce of tincture of opium, in half a\r\npint of water. Rub well in, along the back and loins, the following:\r\nstrong mustard, three ounces; aqua ammonia and water, each one and a\r\nhalf ounces. Some modifications in the treatment of this disease, as\r\nwell as of most others, will be necessary under certain circumstances,\r\nwhich can only be determined by the veterinary practitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARTER EVIL.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country, this disease--known by the other names\r\nof black quarter, and joint murrain--is quite common among young cattle,\r\nand is generally fatal in its termination. There is little or no warning\r\nof its approach. The first animals in a herd to be attacked are\r\ngenerally those in a full, plethoric condition.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The joints suddenly become swollen, and so painful as to\r\nproduce severe lameness, particularly in the hind parts. General\r\nirritative fever exists in the system, attended with great tenderness of\r\nthe loins; the head is poked out; eyes red and bulging; the roots of the\r\nhorns, as well as the breath, are hot; the muzzle dry, and nostrils\r\nexpanded; pulse rises to seventy or eighty, full and hard; respiration\r\nis hurried; the animal is constantly moaning, and appears to be\r\nunconscious of surrounding objects; the swelling of the limbs extends to\r\nthe shoulder and haunch; the animal totters, falls and dies in from\r\ntwelve to twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Early bleeding is requisite here, to be followed by active\r\npurgatives; after which, give one of the following powders every half\r\nhour: nitrate of potassa, two ounces; tartrate of antimony and\r\npulverized digitalis, of each one and a half drachms; mix, and divide\r\ninto eight powders. These should not be renewed. Cold linseed tea should\r\nbe freely given.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABIES.\r\n\r\nHydrophobia in cattle is the result of the bite of a rabid dog, from\r\nwhich bite no animal escapes. The effects produced by the wound made by\r\nthe teeth of such an animal, after the virus is once absorbed into the\r\ncirculation of the blood, are so poisonous that all treatment is\r\nuseless. The proper remedies must be instantly applied to prevent this\r\nabsorption, or the case is utterly hopeless. Among men, nine out of\r\nevery ten bitten by rabid dogs escape the terrible effects resulting\r\nfrom this dreadful disorder, without resorting to any applications to\r\nprevent it. It is a well-established fact, that men, when bitten by\r\ndogs, are generally wounded in some part protected by their clothing,\r\nwhich guards them from the deleterious effects of the saliva which\r\ncovers the teeth, and which, at such times, is deadly poison. The teeth,\r\nin passing through the clothing, are wiped clean, so that the virus is\r\nnot introduced into the blood; hence the comparatively few cases of\r\nrabies occurring in man. When, however, the wound is made upon an\r\nexposed surface, as the flesh of the hand, or of the face, this fatal\r\ndisease is developed in spite of every precaution, unless such\r\nprecautions are immediately taken. For this reason, cattle when bitten,\r\ndo not escape the disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animal separates itself from the rest of the herd,\r\nstanding in a kind of stupor, with the eyes half-closed; respiration\r\nnatural; pulse quickened; temperature of body and limbs natural; the\r\nslightest noise agitates, causing the eyes to glare and exciting\r\nbellowing; the bark of a dog produces the most violent effects; the\r\nanimal foams at the mouth and staggers as it walks; if water is\r\noffered, the muzzle is plunged into it, but the victim cannot drink; in\r\nmaking the effort, the most fearful consequences are produced. The\r\nanimal now seeks to do mischief,--and the quicker it is then destroyed,\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This must be applied quickly, or not at all. The moment an\r\nanimal is bitten, that moment the wound should be searched for, and when\r\nfound, should be freely opened with a knife, and lunar caustic, caustic\r\npotash, or the permanganate of potash at once applied to all parts of\r\nthe wound, care being taken not to suffer a single scratch to escape.\r\nThis, if attended to in time, will save the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED WATER.\r\n\r\nThis disease derives its name from the color of the urine voided in it.\r\nIt is one of the most common complaints of horned cattle, and one of the\r\nmost troublesome to manage.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Respiration hurried; rumination ceases; a high degree of\r\nfever presented; the animal moans, arches the back, and strains in\r\npassing the urine, which is tinged with blood, or presents the\r\nappearance of pure blood. Prof. Gamgee, of the Edinburgh Veterinary\r\nCollege, says: \"The cause is almost invariably feeding on turnips that\r\nhave grown on damp, ill-drained land; and very often a change of diet\r\nstops the spread of this disease in the byre. Other succulent food,\r\ngrown under similar circumstances, may produce the same symptoms,\r\ntending to disturb the digestive organs and the blood-forming process.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of my investigations as to the cause of various\r\ncattle-diseases, and of red water in particular. I have found that it\r\nis unknown on well-drained farms and in dairies where turnips are used\r\nonly in a moderate degree. The lands of poor people furnish the roots\r\nmost likely to induce this disorder; and I can confirm the statement of\r\nthe late Mr. Cumming, of Elton, who, in his very interesting essay upon\r\nthis subject, says, particularly in reference to Aberdeenshire, that it\r\nis 'a disease essentially attacking the poor man's cow; and to be seen\r\nand studied, requires a practice extending into the less favorably\r\nsituated parts of the country. On large farms, where good stock is well\r\nkept, and in town dairies, where artificial food is used to supplement\r\nthe supply of turnips, it is seldom now seen.'\r\n\r\n\"_Symptoms._--General derangement attracts the dairyman's attention,\r\nand, upon observing the urine which the animal has voided, it is seen to\r\nbe of a red, or of a reddish brown, or claret color; sometimes\r\ntransparent, at others clear. The color increases in depth; other\r\nsecretions are checked; the animal becomes hide-bound, and the milk goes\r\noff. Appetite and rumination are suspended; the pulse becomes extremely\r\nfeeble and frequent, though--as in all debilitating, or anæmic,\r\ndisorders--the heart's action is loud and strong, with a decided venous\r\npulse, or apparent regurgitation, in the large veins of the neck.\r\n\r\n\"In some cases, if even a small quantity of blood be withdrawn, the\r\nanimal drops in a fainting state. In red water, the visible mucous\r\nmembranes are blanched, and the extremities cold, indicating the languid\r\nstate of the blood's circulation and the poverty of the blood itself.\r\nConstipation is one of the most obstinate complications; and many\r\nveterinary surgeons--aware that, if the bowels can be acted on, the\r\nanimal is cured--have employed purgatives in quantities far too large,\r\ninducing at times even death. Occasionally, diarrhoea is one of the\r\nfirst, and not of the unfavorable, symptoms.\"\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give one pint of linseed-oil; clysters of soap and water\r\nshould be freely used; and give plenty of linseed-tea to drink. When the\r\nurine is abundant, give one ounce of tincture of opium, with one drachm\r\nof powdered aloes, three times, at intervals of six or eight hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEUMATISM.\r\n\r\nThis is a constitutional inflammatory affection of the joints, affecting\r\nthe fibrous tissue and serous, or synovial membrane. It is caused by\r\nexposure to cold and wet; being quite common in low, marshy sections.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Loss of appetite; upon forcing the animal to move, every\r\njoint seems stiffened; nose dry; coat staring; constipation is also an\r\nattendant symptom; the joints, one or more, become swollen and painful.\r\nThis may be regarded as a metastic, or shifting disease; first one part,\r\nand then another, seems to be affected.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Mild purgatives should be used; one-half-ounce doses of\r\ncolchicum-root pulverized will be found useful; one-ounce balls of\r\npine-tar may also be given with advantage. As a local application, the\r\nauthor has found nothing to equal kerosene oil, one pint, to two ounces\r\nof aqua ammonia, well rubbed in, two or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGULATION OF THE INTESTINES.\r\n\r\nThis disease in cattle,--popularly styled Knot, or Gut-tie,--in\r\nconsequence of the peculiar arrangement of the abdominal viscera, is of\r\nvery rare occurrence. When, however, it does occur, the symptoms\r\naccompanying are those of inflammation of the intestines.\r\n\r\nNo kind of treatment will be successful, and the poor brute must suffer\r\nuntil death comes to its relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRUSH IN THE MOUTH.\r\n\r\nAptha, or thrush in the mouth, is a vesicular disease of the mouth,\r\nsometimes occurring as an epizoötic. It is often mistaken for\r\nblain,--inflammation of the tongue, or black tongue,--and usually occurs\r\nin the winter, or early in the spring. It appears in the form of\r\nvesicles, or pustules all over the mouth, occasionally extending to the\r\noutside of the lips. These pustules break, discharging a thin, sanious\r\nfluid, leaving minute ulcers in their places.\r\n\r\nThis disease yields readily to treatment, when it is properly applied.\r\nThree ounces of Epsom-salts, once a day for three or four days, should\r\nbe given in drench; wash the mouth well with a solution of alum,\r\ntincture of myrrh, or vinegar and honey, and it will disappear in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS.\r\n\r\nThese enlargements so common in cattle, have been so admirably\r\ndescribed, in the Veterinarian for 1843, by John Ralph, V.S.,--who has\r\nbeen so successful in the treatment of these morbid growths, that the\r\nbenefit of his experience is here given. He says: \"Of all the\r\naccidental productions met with among cattle, with the exception of\r\nwens, a certain kind of indurated tumor, chiefly situated about the head\r\nand throat, has abounded most in my practice.\r\n\r\n\"The affection often commences in one of the thyroid glands, which\r\nslowly but gradually increases in size, feels firm when grasped, and\r\nevinces very little tenderness. Generally the attendant is alarmed by a\r\nsnoring or wheezing noise emitted by the animal in respiration, before\r\nhe is aware of the existence of any tumefaction. This continues to\r\nincrease, embracing in its progress the adjacent cellular and muscular\r\ntissues, and frequently the submaxillary and parotid glands. It becomes\r\nfirmly attached to the skin through which an opening is ultimately\r\neffected by the pressure of pus from the centre of the tumor.\r\n\r\n\"The swelling often presents an irregular surface, and various centres\r\nof maturation exist; but the evacuations only effect a partial and\r\ntemporary reduction of its bulk, in consequence of the continued\r\nextension of the morbid growth and ulcerative process which often\r\nproceed towards the pharynx, rendering respiration and deglutition still\r\nmore difficult, until at length the animal sinks from atrophy or\r\n_phthisis pulmonalis_.\r\n\r\n\"In the early part of my practice, having been frustrated in my attempts\r\nto establish healthy action in these ulcers, and referring to the works\r\nthat I had on surgery for information, I concluded that they bore some\r\nresemblance to cancer in the human being, and determined to attempt\r\nextirpation. Subsequently, numerous cases have occurred in which I have\r\nsuccessfully carried that determination into effect. I have had some\r\ninstances of failure, which failure always arose from some portion of\r\nthe morbid growth having been left.\r\n\r\n\"In the first stage, I have reason to believe that the tumor may be\r\ndispersed by the general and topical use of the iodurets. After the\r\nsuppuration, I have tried them in vain.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the nature of the tumor is clearly developed, I generally\r\nattempt its removal, and, when most prominent by the side of the larynx,\r\nI proceed in the following manner:--Having cast the beast, turned the\r\nocciput toward the ground, and bolstered it up with bundles of straw, I\r\nproceed to make an incision through it, if the skin is free, parallel\r\nwith, and over, and between the trachea and _sterno-maxillaris_,\r\nextending it sufficiently forward into the inter-maxillary spaces. If I\r\nfind it firmly attached to the apex of the tumor, I then enclose it in a\r\ncurvilinear incision and proceed to detach the healthy skin to beyond\r\nthe verge of the tumor.\r\n\r\n\"Its edges being held by an assistant, the knife is directed downwards\r\nthrough the subcutaneous parts, and all those that exhibit the slightest\r\nchange from healthy structure are removed.\r\n\r\n\"By tying any considerable blood-vessel before dividing it, and by using\r\nthe handle of the scalpel and the fingers in detaching the portion of\r\nthe parotid gland towards the ear the hemorrhage was always\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\n\"The wound is then treated in the ordinary way; except that detergents\r\nand even antiseptics are often needed to arouse healthy action, and the\r\naddition of some preparation of iodine is often made to the digestive.\r\nIn directing the constitutional treatment, our chief aim must be to\r\nsupport the animal system with plenty of gruel until rumination is\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n\"I need not note that the operation should be performed after the animal\r\nhas fasted some hours.\r\n\r\n\"As the success of the operation depends on an entire removal of the\r\ndiseased parts, and as the submaxillary and parotid glands, with\r\nimportant branches of nerves and blood-vessels, are often enveloped\r\ntherein, we must not hesitate to remove the former, nor to divide the\r\nlatter. It has occasionally happened that a rupture has been made in the\r\noesophagus, or pharynx, during the operation. In that case, a portion\r\nof the gruel with which the animal is drenched escapes for a few days;\r\nbut I always found that the wound healed by granulation, without any\r\nparticular attention.\r\n\r\n\"The weight of these tumors varies from a few ounces to some pounds. One\r\nthat I removed from a two-year-old Galloway bullock, weighed six pounds\r\nand a quarter. A considerable portion of the skin that covered it was\r\nexcised and included in the above weight. It comprehended one of the\r\nparotid glands, and I had to divide the trunk of the carotid artery and\r\njugular vein.\r\n\r\n\"This affection may be distinguished from parotiditis and other\r\n_phlegmasiæ_ by the action of constitutional disturbance, and heat, and\r\ntenderness, and by the lingering progress it makes. I was once called to\r\na bull laboring under alarming dyspnoea that had gradually increased.\r\nNo external enlargement was perceptible; but on introducing my hand into\r\nthe mouth, a large polypus was found hanging from the _velum palati_\r\ninto the pharynx, greatly obstructing the elevation of the epiglottis\r\nand the passage of food. After performing tracheotomy, to prevent\r\nsuffocation, I passed a ligature around its pedicle in the way suggested\r\nby the old anatomist, Cheselden.\r\n\r\n\"A section of one of these tumors mostly displays several abscesses,\r\nwith matter varying in consistency and often very fetid, enclosed in\r\nwhat seems to me to be fibro-cartilaginous cysts, the exterior of which\r\nsometimes gradually disappears in the surrounding more vascular abnormal\r\ngrowth. Osseous matter (I judge from the grating of the scalpel upon it)\r\noccasionally enters into the composition of the cysts.\r\n\r\n\"I have treated this affection in cattle of the Long-horned,\r\nShort-horned, Galloway, and Highland breeds; and from the number of\r\nbulls in this class of patients, have reason to conclude that they are\r\nmore liable to it than the female.\r\n\r\n\"About twelve months ago, I examined the head of a cow, on the right\r\nfacial region of which there existed an enormous tumor, extending from\r\nthe eye to the lips, and which I mistook during life for a periosteal\r\nenlargement. On cutting into it, my mistake was evident. There was\r\nscarcely a trace of the original bones beneath the mass; even those\r\nforming the nasal sinuses on that side were replaced by a formation much\r\nresembling the cysts before alluded to, and full of abscesses. The\r\nprogress of the disease was decisively marked in the inferior rim of the\r\norbital cavity, where the osseous matter was being removed, and the\r\nmorbid structure deposited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERS ABOUT THE JOINTS.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, the joints assume a tumefied appearance, generally\r\nulcerating, and causing painful wounds.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The application of one part of alum to two parts of\r\nprepared chalk, powdered and sprinkled upon the parts, is usually all\r\nthat is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARBLES.\r\n\r\nIt has been a prevalent opinion among farmers, that warbles are so many\r\nevidences of the good condition of their cattle. It must, however, be\r\nborne in mind that the warbles are the _larvæ_ of the _oestrus bovis_,\r\nwhich is said to be the most beautiful variety of gad-fly. This fly,\r\njudging from the objects of its attack, must be particularly choice in\r\nits selection of animals upon which to deposit its eggs, as it rarely\r\nchooses those poor in flesh, or in an unhealthy condition. From this\r\ncircumstance, probably, has arisen the opinion above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME AGAIN.]\r\n\r\nThese warbles--or _larvæ_ of the _oestrus bovis_--so nearly resemble\r\nbots in the horse--or _larvæ oestrus equi_--that, were it not for\r\ntheir increased size, they might readily be mistaken the one for the\r\nother. There is, however, one other difference, and that is in the rings\r\nwhich encircle the body; those of the former being perfectly smooth,\r\nwhile those of the latter are prickly, and from one third to one half\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nThe author was called, in the year 1856, to see the prize cow, Pet,\r\nbelonging to James Kelly, of Cleveland, Ohio, whose extraordinary yield\r\nof butter and milk had been reported in the _Ohio Farmer_, a short time\r\nprevious to his visit. This animal was found by him in rather poor\r\ncondition; the causes of which he could only trace to the existence of\r\nthese worms, comfortably located, as they were, beneath the animal's\r\nhide, and forming small tumors all along the spinal column, each being\r\nsurrounded by a considerable quantity of pus. A number of these were\r\nremoved by means of a curved bistoury and a pair of forceps, since which\r\ntime--as he has been informed--the animal has rapidly improved,\r\nregaining her former good condition.\r\n\r\nSome may urge that this is an isolated case; but an examination of\r\ncattle for themselves, will convince them to the contrary. It may be\r\nadded, that two other cows, belonging to the same gentleman, were also\r\nexamined at the same time,--one of them being in good condition, and the\r\nother, out of condition. From the back of the latter several of these\r\ninsects were removed, since which time she also has much improved. The\r\nformer was entirely free from them. These cows were all kept in the same\r\npasture, received the same care, and were fed on the same food, and at\r\nthe same time; and as the removal of these larvæ has been productive of\r\nsuch beneficial results, have we not a right to infer that these insects\r\nare injurious?\r\n\r\nIf we go further and examine, in the spring of the year, all cattle\r\nwhich are subject to them, instead of finding them in the fine\r\ncondition which one would naturally expect,--considering the abundance\r\nof fresh young grass whose vigorous life they may incorporate into their\r\nown,--they are out of condition, and out of spirits, with a laggard eye,\r\na rough coat, and, in some cases, a staggering gait, as though their\r\nstrength had failed in consequence.\r\n\r\nHow shall such attacks be prevented? During the months of August and\r\nSeptember this gad-fly is busily engaged in depositing its eggs. Some\r\nare of the opinion that they are placed on the hairs of the animal;\r\nothers, that the skin is perforated, and the egg deposited in the\r\nopening, which would account for the apparent pain manifested by cattle\r\nat and after the time of such deposit. Be this as it may, it is certain\r\nthat the maggot works its way into the muscular fibre of the back, and\r\ndepends upon the animal's blood for the nourishment which it receives.\r\n\r\nThe author has been informed, by persons in whom he ought to have\r\nconfidence, that the _free use of the card_, during the above-named\r\nmonths, is a specific protection against the attacks of the _oestrus\r\nbovis_. He repeats this information here, not without diffidence; since\r\nso large a majority of stock-owners evince, by their lack of familiarity\r\nwith the practical use of this convenient and portable instrument, an\r\nutter disbelief in its reliability and value.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMS.\r\n\r\nCattle are not so subject to worms proper as are the other domestic\r\nanimals; nor, when these parasites do exist, is any injurious effect\r\napparent, except it be in the case of young calves of a weakly\r\nconstitution. Worms are most commonly located in the small intestines,\r\nand cause there considerable irritation, and consequently, general\r\nemaciation, or at least a tendency to it.\r\n\r\nThe cause, however, is easily removed by administering doses of sulphate\r\nof iron, one-half drachm each, in molasses once or twice a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMS IN THE BRONCHIAL TUBES.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the bronchial tubes is often caused by worms of the\r\n_strongylus_ species. Upon examination after death, the bronchial\r\npassages are completely blocked-up by these hangers-on.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A rough, staring coat; hide-bound; painful cough;\r\nrespiration hurried, etc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--But little can be done by way of treatment in this\r\ndisease. The administration of small doses of spirits of turpentine has,\r\nin some instances, proved successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURGICAL OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nCASTRATION.\r\n\r\nThe period most commonly selected for this operation is between the\r\nfirst and third months. The nearer it is to the expiration of the first\r\nmonth, the less danger attends the operation.\r\n\r\nSome persons prepare the animal by the administration of a dose of\r\nphysic; but others proceed at once to the operation when it best suits\r\ntheir convenience, or that of the farmer. Care, however, should be taken\r\nthat the young animal is in perfect health. The mode formerly practised\r\nwas simple enough:--a piece of whip-cord was tied as tightly as possible\r\naround the scrotum. The supply of blood being thus completely cut off,\r\nthe bag and its contents soon became livid and dead, and were suffered\r\nto hang, by some careless operators, until they dropped off, or they\r\nwere cut off on the second or third day.\r\n\r\nIt is now, however, the general practice to grasp the scrotum in the\r\nhand, between the testicles and the belly, and to make an incision in\r\none side of it, near the bottom, of sufficient depth to penetrate\r\nthrough the inner covering of the testicle, and of sufficient length to\r\nadmit of its escape. The testicle immediately bursts from its bag, and\r\nis seen hanging by its cord.\r\n\r\nThe careless or brutal operator now firmly ties a piece of small string\r\naround the cord, and having thus stopped the circulation, cuts through\r\nthe cord, half an inch below the ligature, and removes the testicle. He,\r\nhowever, who has any feeling for the poor animal on which he is\r\noperating, considers that the only use of the ligature is to compress\r\nthe blood-vessels and prevent after-hemorrhage, and, therefore, saves a\r\ngreat deal of unnecessary torture by including them alone in the\r\nligature, and afterwards dividing the rest of the cord. The other\r\ntesticle is proceeded with in the same way and the operation is\r\ncomplete. The length of the cord should be so contrived that it will\r\nimmediately retract, or be drawn back, into the scrotum, but not higher,\r\nwhile the ends of the string hang out through the wound. In the course\r\nof about a week, the strings will usually drop off, and the wounds will\r\nspeedily heal. There will rarely be any occasion to make any\r\napplication to the scrotum, except fomentation of it, if much swelling\r\nshould ensue.\r\n\r\nA few, whose practice cannot be justified, seize the testicle as soon as\r\nit escapes from the bag, and, pulling violently, break the cord and tear\r\nit out. It is certain that when a blood-vessel is thus ruptured, it\r\nforcibly contracts, and very little bleeding follows; but if the cord\r\nbreaks high up, and retracts into the belly, considerable inflammation\r\nhas occasionally ensued, and the beast has been lost.\r\n\r\nThe application of _torsion_--or the twisting of the arteries by a pair\r\nof forceps which will firmly grasp them--has, in a great degree,\r\nsuperseded every other mode of castration, both in the larger and the\r\nsmaller domesticated animals. The spermatic artery is exposed, and\r\nseized with the forceps, which are then closed by a very simple\r\nmechanical contrivance; the vessel is drawn a little out from its\r\nsurrounding tissue, the forceps are turned around seven or eight times,\r\nand the vessel liberated. It will be found to be perfectly closed; a\r\nsmall knot will have formed on its extremity; it will retract into the\r\nsurrounding surface, and not a drop more of blood will flow from it; the\r\ncord may then be divided, and the bleeding from any little vessel\r\narrested in the same way. Neither the application of the hot iron, nor\r\nof the wooden clamps, whether with or without caustic, can be necessary\r\nin the castration of the calf.\r\n\r\nA new instrument was introduced in France, some few years since, for\r\nthis purpose, called the _acraseur_,--so constructed as to throw a chain\r\nover the cord, which is wound up by means of a screw working upon the\r\nchain, and at the same time the cord is twisted off. No bleeding\r\nfollows this method of operating.\r\n\r\nThis instrument is constructed upon the same principle as the _acraseur_\r\nfor use in the human family, for the removal of hemorrhoids, etc., the\r\ndimensions of the two only varying.\r\n\r\nThe advantages resulting from the use of this instrument over all other\r\nmethods are, that the parts generally heal within a week,--the operation\r\nis not so painful to the animal,--it is less troublesome to the\r\noperator,--also to the owner of the animal,--and lastly, it is a safer\r\nand more scientific operation. Its success in France soon gave it a\r\nreputation in England, and recently it has been introduced by the author\r\ninto this country, and with the best results. Contractors, hearing of\r\nthe success attending this new mode of operating, have visited him from\r\nall parts of the country to witness its performance, and not one has\r\nreturned without leaving an order for this instrument,--so well\r\nconvinced have they been of its decided superiority over all other\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACHEOTOMY.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the formation of tumors about the throat in cattle,\r\nfrom inflammation of the parotid gland, blain, etc., so characteristic\r\nof this species of animals, it sometimes becomes necessary to perform\r\nthis operation in order to save their lives. It never fails to give\r\ninstant relief.\r\n\r\nAfter the animal has been properly secured,--which is done by an\r\nassistant's holding the nose with one hand, and one of the horns with\r\nthe other,--the operator draws the skin tight over the windpipe with the\r\nthumb and fingers of his left hand; then, with the scalpel in his right,\r\ncuts through the skin, making an incision about three inches long,\r\ndissecting up the skin on each side, which brings the _trachea_, or\r\nwindpipe, in full view. He then cuts out a piece of the cartilaginous\r\nrings, about two inches long and about half an inch wide. This simple\r\noperation has saved the lives of very many valuable animals. The wound\r\nreadily heals, and seldom leaves any perceptible blemish, if the work is\r\nproperly performed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAYING.\r\n\r\nTo secure a more uniform flow and a richer quality of milk, cows are\r\nsometimes spayed, or castrated. The milk of spayed cows is pretty\r\nuniform in quality; and this quality will be, on an average, a little\r\nmore than before the operation was performed. In instances where the\r\nresults of this operation have been carefully noted,--and the operation\r\nis rarely resorted to in this country, in comparison with the custom in\r\nFrance and other continental countries,--the quality of the milk has\r\nbeen greatly improved, the yield becoming regular for some years, and\r\nvarying only in accordance with the difference in the succulence of the\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe proper time for spaying is about five or six weeks after calving, or\r\nat the time when the largest quantity of milk is given. There seems to\r\nbe some advantages in spaying for milk and butter dairies, where\r\nattention is not paid to the raising of stock. The cows are more quiet,\r\nnever being liable to returns of seasons of heat, which always more or\r\nless affect the milk, both in quantity and quality. They give milk\r\nnearly uniform in these respects, for several years, provided the food\r\nis uniformly succulent and nutritious. Their milk is influenced like\r\nthat of other cows, though to a less extent, by the quality and\r\nquantity of food; so that in winter, unless the animal is properly\r\nattended to, the yield will decrease somewhat, but will rise again as\r\ngood feed returns. This uniformity for the milk-dairy is of immense\r\nadvantage. Besides, the cow, when old and inclined to dry up, takes on\r\nfat with greater rapidity, and produces a juicy and tender beef,\r\nsuperior, at the same age, to that of the ox.\r\n\r\nThe following method of performing this operation is sanctioned by the\r\npractice of eminent veterinary surgeons in France:--\r\n\r\nHaving covered the eyes of the cow to be operated upon, she is placed\r\nagainst a wall, provided with five rings firmly fastened and placed as\r\nfollows: the first corresponds to the top of the withers; the second, to\r\nthe lower anterior part of the breast; the third is placed a little\r\ndistance from the angle of the shoulder; the fourth is opposite to the\r\nanterior and superior part of the lower region; and the fifth, which is\r\nbehind, answers to the under-part of the buttocks. A strong assistant is\r\nplaced between the wall and the head of the animal, who firmly holds the\r\nleft horn in his left hand, and with his right, the muzzle, which he\r\nelevates a little. This done, the end of a long and strong-plaited cord\r\nis passed, through the ring which corresponds to the lower part of the\r\nbreast, and fastened; the free end of the cord is brought along the left\r\nflank, and through the ring which is below and in front of the withers.\r\nThis is brought down along the breast behind the shoulder and the angle\r\nof the fore-leg in order to pass it through the third ring; then it must\r\nbe passed around against the outer angle of the left hip, and fastened\r\nafter having been drawn tightly to the posterior ring, by a simple\r\nbow-knot.\r\n\r\nThe cow being thus firmly fixed to the wall, a cord is fastened by a\r\nslip-noose around her hocks, to keep them together in such a manner that\r\nshe cannot kick the operator, the free end of the cord and the tail\r\nbeing held by an assistant. The cow thus secured cannot, during the\r\noperation, move forward, nor lie down, and the operator has all the ease\r\ndesirable, and is protected from accident.\r\n\r\nThe operator next--placed opposite to the animal's left flank, with his\r\nback turned a little toward the head of the animal--cuts off the hair\r\nwhich covers the hide in the middle of the flanks, at an equal distance\r\nbetween the back and hip, for the space of thirteen or fourteen\r\ncentimetres in circumference (the French _centimetre_ is rather more\r\nthan thirty-nine one hundredths of an inch); a convex bistoury is\r\nplaced, opened, between his teeth, the edge out, the joints to the left;\r\nthen, with both hands, he seizes the hide in the middle of the flank,\r\nand forms of it a wrinkle of the requisite elevation, running lengthwise\r\nof the body. The assistant seizes with his right hand the right side of\r\nthis wrinkle; the operator takes the bistoury and cuts the wrinkle, at\r\none stroke, through the middle; the wrinkle having been suffered to go\r\ndown, a separation of the hide is presented, of sufficient length to\r\nadmit the introduction of the hand; the edges of the hide are separated\r\nwith the thumb and fore-finger of the left hand, and in like manner the\r\nabdominal muscles are cut through, for the distance of a centimetre from\r\nthe lower extremity of the incision made in the hide,--the _iliac_\r\nslightly obliquely, and the _lumbar_ across; a puncture of the\r\nperitoneum, at the upper extremity of the wound, is then made with the\r\nstraight bistoury; the buttoned bistoury is then introduced, and moved\r\nobliquely from above to the lower part, up to the termination of the\r\nincision made in the abdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nThe flank being opened, the right hand is introduced into the abdomen,\r\nand directed along the right side of the cavity of the pelvis, behind\r\nthe paunch, and underneath the rectum, to the matrix; after the position\r\nof these viscera is ascertained, the organs of reproduction, or ovaries,\r\nare searched for, which are at the extremity of the matrix; when found,\r\nthey are seized between the thumb and fore-finger, detached completely\r\nfrom the ligaments which keeps them in their place, and by a light pull,\r\nthe cord and the vessels, the uterine or Fallopian tube, are separated\r\nat their place of union with the ovarium, by means of the nails of the\r\nthumb and fore-finger, which present themselves at the point of touch,\r\nthus breaking the cord and bringing away the ovary.\r\n\r\nThe hand is again introduced into the abdominal cavity, and the\r\nremaining ovaries brought away in like manner. A suture is then placed\r\nof three or four double threads, waxed at an equal distance, and at two\r\ncentimetres, or a little less, from the lips of the wound, passing it\r\nthrough the divided tissues; a movement is made from the left hand with\r\nthe piece of thread; having reached that point, a fastening is made with\r\na double knot, the seam placed in the intervals of the thread from the\r\nright, and as the lips of the wound are approached, a fastening is\r\neffected by a simple knot, with a bow, care being taken not to close too\r\ntightly the lower part of the seam, in order to allow the suppuration,\r\nwhich may be established in the wound, to escape. The wound is then\r\ncovered up with a pledget of lint, kept in its place by three or four\r\nthreads passed through the stitches, and the operation is complete.\r\n\r\nIt happens, sometimes, that in cutting the muscles before mentioned, one\r\nor two of the arteries are severed. Should much blood escape, a ligature\r\nmust be applied before opening the peritoneal sac; since, if this\r\nprecaution is omitted, blood will escape into the abdomen, which may\r\noccasion the most serious consequences.\r\n\r\nFor the first eight days succeeding, the animal should have a light\r\ndiet, and a soothing, lukewarm draught; if the weather should be cold,\r\ncover with a woollen covering. She must be prevented from licking the\r\nwound, and from rubbing it against other bodies. The third day after the\r\noperation, bathe morning and evening about the wound with water of\r\nmallows lukewarm, or anoint it with a salve of hog's lard, and\r\nadminister an emollient glyster during three or four days.\r\n\r\nEight days after the operation, take away the bandage, the lint, the\r\nfastenings, and the thread. The wound is at that time, as a general\r\nthing, completely cicatrized. Should, however, some slight suppuration\r\nexist, a slight pressure must be used above the part where it is\r\nlocated, so as to cause the pus to leave, and if it continues more than\r\nfive or six days, emollients must be supplied by alcolized water, or\r\nchloridized, especially in summer. The animal is then to be brought back\r\ngradually to her ordinary nourishment.\r\n\r\nIn some cows, a swelling of the body is observable a short time after\r\nhaving been spayed, attributable to the introduction of cold air into\r\nthe abdomen during the operation; but this derangement generally ceases\r\nwithin twenty-four hours. Should the contrary occur, administer one or\r\ntwo sudorific draughts, such as wine, warm cider, or a half-glass of\r\nbrandy, in a quart of warm water,--treatment which suffices in a short\r\ntime to restore a healthy state of the belly,--the animal at the same\r\ntime being protected by two coverings of wool.\r\n\r\nThe only precaution, in the way of management, to be observed as a\r\npreparative for the operation is, that on the preceding evening not so\r\ncopious a meal should be given. The operation should also be performed\r\nin the morning before the animal has fed, so that the operator may not\r\nfind any obstacle from the primary digestive organs, especially the\r\npaunch, which, during its state of ordinary fullness, might prevent\r\noperating with facility.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of spaying milch-cows are thus summed up by able French\r\nwriters: First, rendering permanent the secretion of milk, and having a\r\nmuch greater quantity within the given time of every year; second, the\r\nquality of milk being improved; third, the uncertainty of, and the\r\ndangers incident to, breeding being, to a great extent, avoided; fourth,\r\nthe increased disposition to fatten even when giving milk freely, or\r\nwhen, from excess of age or from accidental circumstances, the secretion\r\nof milk is otherwise checked; fifth, the very short time required to\r\nproduce a marketable condition; and sixth, the meat of spayed cattle\r\nbeing of a quality superior to that of ordinary cattle.\r\n\r\nThis operation would seem to have originated in this country. The London\r\nVeterinary Journal of 1834 contains the following, taken from the United\r\nStates Southern Agriculturist:--\"Some years since, I passed a summer at\r\nNatchez, and put up at a hotel there, kept by Mr. Thomas Winn. During\r\nthe time that I was there I noticed two remarkably fine cows, which were\r\nkept constantly in the stable, the servant who had charge of the horses,\r\nfeeding them regularly three times a day with green guinea grass, cut\r\nwith a sickle. These cows had so often attracted my attention, on\r\naccount of the great beauty of their form, and deep red color, the large\r\nsize of their bags, and the high condition in which they were kept, that\r\nI was at length induced to ask Mr. Winn to what breed of cattle they\r\nbelonged, and his reasons for keeping them constantly in the stable in\r\npreference to allowing them to run in the pasture, where they could\r\nenjoy the benefit of air and exercise, and at the same time crop their\r\nown food, and thereby save the labor and trouble of feeding them? Mr.\r\nWinn, in reply to these inquiries, stated that the two cows which I so\r\nmuch admired were of the common stock of the country, and he believed,\r\nof Spanish origin; but they were both spayed cows, and that they had\r\ngiven milk either two or three years. Considering this a phenomenon (if\r\nnot in nature at least in art), I made further inquiries of Mr. Winn,\r\nwho politely entered into a very interesting detail, communicating facts\r\nwhich were as extraordinary as they were novel. Mr. Winn, by way of\r\npreface, observed that he, in former years, had been in the habit of\r\nreading English magazines, which contained accounts of the\r\nplowing-matches which were annually held in some of the southern\r\ncounties of England, performed by cattle, and that he had noticed that\r\nthe prizes were generally adjudged to the plowman who worked with spayed\r\nheifers; and although there was no connection between that subject and\r\nthe facts which he should state, it was, nevertheless, the cause that\r\nfirst directed his mind into the train of thought and reasoning which\r\nfinally induced him to make the experiments, which resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of the facts which he detailed, and which I will narrate as\r\naccurately as my memory will enable me to do it, after the lapse of more\r\nthan twenty years. Mr. Winn's frequent reflections had (he said) led him\r\nto the belief \"that if cows were spayed soon after calving, and while in\r\na full flow of milk, they would continue to give milk for many years\r\nwithout intermission, or any diminution of quantity, except what would\r\nbe caused by a change from green to dry, or less succulent food.\" To\r\ntest this hypothesis, Mr. Winn caused a very good cow, then in full\r\nmilk, to be spayed. The operation was performed about one month after\r\nthe cow had produced her third calf; it was not attended with any severe\r\npain, or much or long continued fever. The cow was apparently well in a\r\nfew days, and very soon yielded her usual quantity of milk, and\r\ncontinued to give freely for several years without any intermission or\r\ndiminution in quantity, except when the food was scarce and dry; but a\r\nfull flow of milk always came back upon the return of a full supply of\r\ngreen food. This cow ran in the Mississippi low grounds or swamp near\r\nNatchez, got cast in deep mire, and was found dead. Upon her death, Mr.\r\nWinn caused a second cow to be spayed. The operation was entirely\r\nsuccessful. The cow gave milk constantly for several years, but in\r\njumping a fence stuck a stake in her bag, that inflicted a severe wound,\r\nwhich obliged Mr. Winn to kill her. Upon this second loss, Mr. Winn had\r\ntwo other cows spayed, and, to prevent the recurrence of injuries from\r\nsimilar causes with those which had occasioned him the loss of the first\r\ntwo spayed cows, he resolved to keep them always in the stable, or some\r\nsafe enclosure, and to supply them regularly with green food, which that\r\nclimate throughout the greater part of, if not all, the year enabled him\r\nto procure. The result, in regard to the last two spayed cows, was, as\r\nin the case of the first two, entirely satisfactory, and fully\r\nestablished, as Mr. Winn believed, the fact, that the spaying of cows,\r\nwhile in full milk, will cause them to continue to give milk during the\r\nresidue of their lives, or until prevented by old age. When I saw the\r\nlast two spayed cows it was, I believe, during the third year that they\r\nhad constantly given milk after they were spayed. The character of Mr.\r\nWinn (now deceased) was highly respectable, and the most entire\r\nconfidence could be reposed in the fidelity of his statements; and as\r\nregarded the facts which he communicated in relation to the several cows\r\nwhich he had spayed, numerous persons with whom I became acquainted,\r\nfully confirmed his statements.\"\r\n\r\nIn November 1861, the author was called to perform this operation upon\r\nthe short-horn Galloway cow, Josephine the Second, belonging to Henry\r\nIngersoll, Esq., of this city. This cow was born May 8th, 1860. The\r\nmorning was cold and cloudy. About ten o'clock the cow was cast, with\r\nthe assistance of R. McClure, V.S., after which she was placed under the\r\ninfluence of chloric ether. He then made an incision, about five inches\r\nin length, through the skin and walls of the abdomen, midway between the\r\npelvis bone and the last rib on the left side, passing in his right\r\nhand, cutting away the ovaries from the Fallopian tubes with the\r\nthumbnail. The opening on the side was then closed by means of the\r\ninterrupted suture. The animal recovered from the influence of the\r\nanæsthetic in about fifteen minutes, when she was allowed to rise, and\r\nwalk back to her stall.\r\n\r\nUpon the morning of the second day succeeding the operation, the animal\r\nwas visited and found to be in good spirits, apparently suffering very\r\nlittle pain or inconvenience from the operation, and the wound healing\r\nnicely.\r\n\r\nSince that time, he has operated upon some twenty cows, all of which,\r\nwith a single exception, have thus far proved satisfactory.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these cows are under the direction of a committee from the\r\nPhiladelphia Society for promoting Agriculture, whose duty it is to have\r\na daily record kept of each cow's yield of butter and milk, for one year\r\nfrom the time of spaying. Their report will be perused by the\r\nagricultural community with much interest.\r\n\r\nThe author's own experience will not justify him in speaking either in\r\nfavor of, or against, this operation; as sufficient time has not as yet\r\nelapsed to satisfy him as to its relative advantages and disadvantages.\r\nHe, however, regards the operation as comparatively safe. The French\r\nestimate the loss at about fifteen per cent., and the gain at thirty per\r\ncent. Of those upon which he has operated, not a single animal died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIST OF MEDICINES USED IN TREATING CATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medicines used in the treatment of the diseases of cattle, are\r\nessentially the same as those in vogue for the diseases of the human\r\nbeing and the horse,--the only difference being in their combination and\r\nthe quantities administered.\r\n\r\nABSORBENTS.--Medicines which destroy acidities in the stomach and\r\nbowels; such as chalk, magnesia, etc.\r\n\r\nALTERATIVES.--Medicines which restore the healthy functions of\r\nsecretion, by gradually changing the morbid action in an impaired\r\nconstitution. Those in most common use are Æthiops mineral, antimony,\r\nrosin, sulphur, etc., which form the principal ingredients in all\r\ncondition-powders, and are chiefly useful in diseases of the skin, such\r\nas hide-bound, mange, surfeit, etc.\r\n\r\nALTERATIVE POWDER.--Sulphur pulverized, one pound; black antimony, one\r\nhalf a pound; nitrate of potassa, four ounces; sulphate of iron, one\r\nhalf a pound; linseed meal, one pound; mix well; dose, one half an\r\nounce, night and morning.\r\n\r\nANTACIDS.--Agents which neutralize, by their chemical action, acids in\r\nthe stomach; as ammonia, carbonate of potassa, chalk, lime-water,\r\nmagnesia, and soda.\r\n\r\nANTHELMINTICS.--Remedies used for the expulsion of worms from the\r\nstomach and intestines. These may act chemically or by their cathartic\r\noperation. The most reliable are Æthiops mineral, nux vomica,\r\npreparations of mercury, wormwood, etc.\r\n\r\nANTHELMINTIC POWDERS.--Nux vomica, in one half-drachm doses, two or\r\nthree times daily, to an ox or cow; for calves, the dose must be\r\ndiminished, according to age.\r\n\r\nANTIDOTES.--Medicines which neutralize the effects of poisons by a\r\nchemical union, forming an insoluble compound, or a mild, harmless one.\r\nAlkaline solutions are antidotes for the mineral acids; as soap in\r\nsolution, a simple remedy, and always at hand. Lard, magnesia, and oil\r\nare antidotes for poisoning by arsenic; albumen,--in the form of the\r\nwhite of an egg,--milk, etc., for corrosive sublimate, and other\r\nmercurial preparations.\r\n\r\nANTISEPTICS.--Medicines which prevent putridity in animal substances,\r\nand arrest putrefaction, when already existing. These are used both\r\nexternally and internally. The chief specifics of this class are the\r\nacids, alcohol, ammonia, asafoetida, camphor, charcoal, chloride of\r\nlime, cinchona, ether, and opium.\r\n\r\nANTISPASMODICS.--Medicines which exert their power in allaying\r\ninordinate motions or spasms in the system, arising from various causes,\r\nsuch as debility, worms, etc. Those most generally in use are ammonia,\r\nasafoetida, camphor, cinchona, ether, lactacarium, mercury, and opium.\r\n\r\nANTISPASMODIC DRAUGHT.--Tincture of opium, one ounce; nitric ether, two\r\nounces; water, one-half pint. Mix for drench; if repeated, it should be\r\nfollowed by a purgative, as soon as the spasms have subsided. Or, use\r\nthe following: sulphuric ether, one to two ounces; water, one-half pint\r\nMix for drench; repeat every hour, if necessary.\r\n\r\nAROMATICS.--Medicines possessing a grateful, spicy scent, and an\r\nagreeable, pungent taste; as anise-seed, cardamoms, cinnamon, cloves,\r\nginger, etc. They are principally used in combination with purgatives,\r\nstomachics, and tonics.\r\n\r\nASTRINGENTS.--Medicines which serve to diminish excessive discharges, as\r\nin diabetes, diarrhoea, etc. The principal agents of this class are\r\nthe acids, alum, chalk, lime-water, opium, and the sulphate of copper,\r\nlead, iron, or zinc.\r\n\r\nASTRINGENT POWDER.--Opium, one drachm; prepared chalk, half an ounce;\r\nJamaica ginger, six drachms. Mix, and divide into four powders; one to\r\nbe given every hour, in a little flour gruel. Or, the following: opium,\r\none drachm; catechu, two drachms; prepared chalk, one ounce. Mix, and\r\ndivide into four powders; to be given as before.\r\n\r\nCARDIACS.--Cordials--so termed, from their possessing warm and\r\nstimulating properties--given to invigorate the system.\r\n\r\nCATHARTICS.--Medicines--also known as purgatives--which cause free\r\nevacuations of the bowels. The only purgatives used by the author in his\r\ncattle practice, as a general rule, are aloes, cream of tartar,\r\nEpsom-salts, lard and linseed-oil. These answer all the indications,\r\nwhere purgatives are useful; indeed, no better purgative for cattle can\r\nbe found than Epsom-salts, combined with a carminative or aromatic drug,\r\nsuch as ginger.\r\n\r\nCAUSTICS.--Substances which burn or destroy parts, by combining with\r\nthem and causing their disorganization; used to destroy unhealthy\r\naction, or morbid growths, such as foul ulcers, foul in the foot, warts,\r\netc. The most powerful remedial of this class is actual cauterization\r\nwith a red-hot iron; caustic potash, lunar caustic, nitrous and\r\nsulphuric acids, permanganate of potash, etc., are also used.\r\n\r\nCORDIALS.--Best brandy, three ounces; orange peel, one drachm; tepid\r\nwater, one pint. Mix all together, for one dose. Or, this for a single\r\ndose: ale, one pint; Jamaica ginger, two drachms. Or, the following,\r\nalso a single dose: allspice, three drachms; ginger, one drachm; caraway\r\nseeds, two drachms.\r\n\r\nDEMULCENTS.--Mucilaginous medicaments, which have the power of\r\ndiminishing the effects of stimulating substances upon the animal\r\nsystem. Of this class, garden rue, or marsh-mallow, gum-arabic, and\r\ngum-tragacanth are the most useful.\r\n\r\nDETERGENTS.--Agents which remove foulness from ulcers.\r\n\r\nDETERGENT POWDER.--Prepared chalk, two ounces; alum, one ounce. Mix; to\r\nbe sprinkled on the part, after washing with Castile-soap and water.\r\nThis powder is also an admirable application for foot-rot in sheep.\r\n\r\nDIAPHORETICS.--Agents which increase the natural discharge through the\r\npores of the skin, and in some animals induce perspiration.\r\n\r\nDIGESTIVES.--Medicines which promote suppuration.\r\n\r\nDIGESTIVE OINTMENT.--Mix together equal portions of spirits of\r\nturpentine and lard. Or, mix together with a gentle heat the following:\r\nVenetian turpentine, one ounce; lard, one ounce; pulverized sulphate of\r\ncopper, two drachms. Or this, mixed: rosin, two ounces; spirits of\r\nturpentine, one ounce; red precipitate, one-half an ounce; lard, two\r\nounces.\r\n\r\nDIURETICS.--Medicines that stimulate the action of the kidneys, and\r\naugment the secretion of urine. These are very useful in swellings of\r\nthe legs, or body. Take of nitrate of potash and rosin, each six\r\ndrachms; mix, and divide in three powders; one to be given daily. Or,\r\nthe following: spirits of turpentine, half an ounce; Castile-soap, one\r\nounce; Jamaica ginger, one drachm; opium, one drachm. Mix: and divide in\r\ntwo balls; one to be given each day.\r\n\r\nEMOLLIENTS.--Medicines which relax the lining tissues, allay irritation,\r\nand soften the parts involved,--generally of a mucilaginous, or oily\r\ncharacter. Lard, linseed meal, and marsh-mallows are chiefly used.\r\n\r\nLITHONTRIPTICS.--Medicines possessing the power of dissolving _calculi_,\r\nor stones in the urinary passages; composed principally, according to\r\nthe researches of modern chemists, of lithic or uric acid. The\r\npreparation most successfully employed by the author in such cases is\r\nmuriatic acid, in doses of from one to two drachms, in a pail of water,\r\nonce or twice a day.\r\n\r\nNARCOTICS.--Medicines that stupefy, and produce sleep. Belladonna,\r\ncamphor, hyoscyamus and opium, are among the narcotics in common use.\r\n\r\nNAUSEANTS.--Agents which cause loss of appetite, and produce the\r\nsensation of vomiting, without affecting it. For this purpose, aloes,\r\ntartrate of antimony, white hellebore, etc., are used.\r\n\r\nPARTURIENTS.--Agents which act upon the uterus. In cases of difficult\r\nparturition, or calving, resort is occasionally had to them. Ergot of\r\nrye is the most powerful.\r\n\r\nREFRIGERANTS.--Cooling applications, which reduce the temperature of the\r\nblood and body; as cold water, ether, lead-water, etc.\r\n\r\nRUBEFACIENTS.--Medicines which gently irritate the skin, producing\r\nredness on white surfaces. Of this class, are aqua ammonia, creosote,\r\nmustard, turpentine, etc.\r\n\r\nSEDATIVES.--Agents which depress the vital energies, without destroying\r\nlife; as aconite, digitalis, hellebore, hydrochloric acid, hyoscyamus,\r\nopium, and tartrate of antimony.\r\n\r\nTONICS.--Medicines which increase the action of the muscular system,\r\ngiving strength and vigor to the animal. These are among the most useful\r\nremedies known to man, and are beneficial in all cases of debility,\r\ntoning up the stomach, and improving the appetite and condition of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nTONIC POWDER.--Pulverized gentian-root, one ounce; Jamaica ginger, one\r\nhalf an ounce; anise-seed, six drachms. Mix, and divide in eight\r\npowders; one to be given night and morning.\r\n\r\nTRAUMATICS.--Medicines which excite the healing process of wounds; as\r\naloes, friar's balsam, myrrh, rosin, sulphate of copper or zinc, tar,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nTRAUMATIC LOTION.--Mix tincture of aloes, one ounce; tincture of myrrh,\r\ntwo ounces.
