He needs, as Bakewell happily expressed\r\nit, \"the best _machine_ for converting herbage and other animal food\r\ninto money.\"\r\n\r\nHe will therefore do well to seek such animals as are most perfect of\r\ntheir kind--such as will pay best for the expense of procuring the\r\nmachinery, for the care and attention bestowed, and for the\r\nconsumption of raw material. The returns come in various forms. They\r\nmay or may not be connected with the ultimate value of the animal. In\r\nthe beef ox and the mutton sheep, they are so connected to a large\r\nextent; in the dairy cow and the fine wooled sheep, this is quite a\r\nsecondary consideration;--in the horse, valued as he is for beauty,\r\nspeed and draught, it is not thought of at all.\r\n\r\nNot only is there a wide range of field for operations, from which the\r\nstock grower may select his own path of procedure, but there is a\r\ndemand that his attention be directed _with a definite aim_, and\r\n_towards an end clearly apprehended_. The first question to be\r\nanswered, is, what do we want? and the next, how shall we get it?\r\n\r\nWhat we want, depends wholly upon our situation and surroundings, and\r\neach must answer it for himself. In England the problem to be solved\r\nby the breeder of neat cattle and sheep is how \"to produce an animal\r\nor a living machine which with a certain quantity and quality of food,\r\nand under certain given circumstances, shall yield in the shortest\r\ntime the largest quantity and best quality of beef, mutton or milk,\r\nwith the largest profit to the producer and at least cost to the\r\nconsumer.\" But this is not precisely the problem for American farmers\r\nto solve, because our circumstances are different. Few, if any, here\r\ngrow oxen for beef alone, but for labor and beef, so that earliest\r\npossible maturity may be omitted and a year or more of labor\r\nprofitably intervene before conversion to beef. Many cultivators of\r\nsheep, too, are so situated as to prefer fine wool, which is\r\nincompatible with the largest quantity and best quality of meat.\r\nOthers differently situated in regard to a meat market would do well\r\nto follow the English practice and aim at the most profitable\r\nproduction of mutton. A great many farmers, not only of those in the\r\nvicinity of large towns, but of those at some distance, might, beyond\r\ndoubt, cultivate dairy qualities in cows, to great advantage, and this\r\ntoo, even, if necessary, at the sacrifice, to considerable extent, of\r\nbeef making qualities. As a general thing dairy qualities have been\r\nsadly neglected in years past.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the object in view, it should be clearly apprehended,\r\nand striven for with persistent and well directed efforts. To buy or\r\nbreed common animals of mixed qualities and use them for any and for\r\nall purposes is too much like a manufacturer of cloth procuring some\r\ncarding, spinning and weaving machinery, adapted to no particular\r\npurpose but which can somehow be used for any, and attempting to make\r\nfabrics of cotton, of wool, and of linen with it. I do not say that\r\ncloth would not be produced, but he would assuredly be slow in getting\r\nrich by it.\r\n\r\nThe stock grower needs not only to have a clear and definite aim in\r\nview, but also to understand the means by which it may best be\r\naccomplished. Among these means a knowledge of the principles of\r\nbreeding holds a prominent place, and this is not of very easy\r\nacquisition by the mass of farmers. The experience of any one man\r\nwould go but a little way towards acquiring it, and there has not been\r\nmuch published on the subject in any form within the reach of most. I\r\nhave been able to find nothing like an extended systematic treatise on\r\nthe subject, either among our own or the foreign agricultural\r\nliterature which has come within my notice. Indeed, from the\r\nscantiness of what appears to have been written, coupled with the fact\r\nthat much knowledge must exist somewhere, one is tempted to believe\r\nthat not all which might have done so, has yet found its way to\r\nprinters' ink. That a great deal has been acquired, we know, as we\r\nknow a tree--by its fruits. That immense achievements have been\r\naccomplished is beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the domestic animals of a country so as greatly to\r\nenhance their individual and aggregate value, and to render the\r\nrearing of them more profitable to all concerned, is surely one of the\r\nachievements of advanced civilization and enlightenment, and is as\r\nmuch a triumph of science and skill as the construction of a railroad,\r\na steamship, an electric telegraph, or any work of architecture. If\r\nany doubt this, let them ponder the history of those breeds of animals\r\nwhich have made England the stock nursery of the world, the perfection\r\nof which enables her to export thousands of animals at prices almost\r\nfabulously beyond their value for any purpose but to propagate their\r\nkind; let them note the patient industry, the genius and application\r\nwhich have been put forth to bring them to the condition they have\r\nattained, and their doubts must cease.\r\n\r\nRobert Bakewell of Dishley, was one of the first of these improvers.\r\nLet us stop for a moment's glance at him. Born in 1725, on the farm\r\nwhere his father and grandfather had been tenants, he began at the age\r\nof thirty to carry out the plans for the improvement of domestic\r\nanimals upon which he had resolved as the result of long and patient\r\nstudy and reflection. He was a man of genius, energy and perseverance.\r\nWith sagacity to conceive and fortitude to perfect his designs, he\r\nlaid his plans and struggled against many disappointments, amid the\r\nridicule and predictions of failure freely bestowed by his\r\nneighbors,--often against serious pecuniary embarrassments; and at\r\nlast was crowned by a wonderful degree of success. When he commenced\r\nletting his rams, (a system first introduced by him and adhered to\r\nduring his life, in place of selling,) they brought him 17_s._ 6_d._\r\neach, for the season. This was ten years after he commenced his\r\nimprovements. Soon the price came to a guinea, then to two or three\r\nguineas--rapidly increasing with the reputation of his stock, until in\r\n1784, they brought him 100 guineas each! Five years later his lettings\r\nfor one season amounted to $30,000!\r\n\r\nWith all his skill and success he seemed afraid lest others might\r\nprofit by the knowledge he had so laboriously acquired. He put no pen\r\nto paper and at death left not even the slightest memorandum throwing\r\nlight upon his operations, and it is chiefly through his\r\ncotemporaries, who gathered somewhat from verbal communications, that\r\nwe know anything regarding them. From these we learn that he formed an\r\nideal standard in his own mind and then endeavored, first by a wide\r\nselection and a judicious and discriminating coupling, to obtain the\r\ntype desired, and then by close breeding, connected with rigorous\r\nweeding out, to perpetuate and fix it.\r\n\r\nAfter him came a host of others, not all of whom concealed their light\r\nbeneath a bushel. By long continued and extensive observation,\r\nresulting in the collection of numerous facts, and by the collation of\r\nthese facts of nature, by scientific research and practical\r\nexperiments, certain physiological laws have been discovered, and\r\nprinciples of breeding have been deduced and established. It is true\r\nthat some of these laws are as yet hidden from us, and much regarding\r\nthem is but imperfectly understood. What we do not know is a deal more\r\nthan what we do know, but to ignore so much as has been discovered,\r\nand is well established, and can be learned by any who care to do so,\r\nand to go on regardless of it, would indicate a degree of wisdom in\r\nthe breeder on a par with that of a builder who should fasten together\r\nwood and iron just as the pieces happened to come to his hand,\r\nregardless of the laws of architecture, and expect a convenient house\r\nor a fast sailing ship to be the result of his labors.\r\n\r\nIs not the usual course of procedure among many farmers too nearly\r\nparallel to the case supposed? Let the ill-favored, chance-bred,\r\nmongrel beasts in their barn yards testify. The truth is, and it is of\r\nno use to deny or disguise the fact, the _improvement_ of domestic\r\nanimals is one of the most important and to a large extent, one of\r\nthe most neglected branches of rural economy. The fault is not that\r\nfarmers do not keep stock enough, much oftener they keep more than\r\nthey can feed to the most profitable point, and when a short crop of\r\nhay comes, there is serious difficulty in supporting them, or in\r\nselling them at a paying price; but the great majority neither bestow\r\nproper care upon the selection of animals for breeding, nor do they\r\nappreciate the dollars and cents difference between such as are\r\nprofitable and such as are profitless. How many will hesitate or\r\nrefuse to pay a dollar for the services of a good bull when some sort\r\nof a calf can be begotten for a \"quarter?\" and this too when one by\r\nthe good male would be worth a dollar more for veal and ten or twenty\r\ndollars more when grown to a cow or an ox? How few will hesitate or\r\nrefuse to allow to a butcher the cull of his calves and lambs for a\r\nfew extra shillings, and this when the butcher's difference in\r\nshillings would soon, were the best kept and the worst sold, grow into\r\nas many dollars and more? How many there are who esteem size to be of\r\nmore consequence than symmetry, or adaptation to the use for which\r\nthey are kept? How many ever sit down to calculate the difference in\r\nmoney value between an animal which barely pays for keeping, or\r\nperhaps not that, and one which pays a profit?\r\n\r\nLet us reckon a little. Suppose a man wishes to buy a cow. Two are\r\noffered him, both four years old, and which might probably be\r\nserviceable for ten years to come. With the same food and attendance\r\nthe first will yield for ten months in the year, an average of five\r\nquarts per day,--and the other for the same term will yield seven\r\nquarts and of equal quality. What is the comparative value of each?\r\nThe difference in yield is six hundred quarts per annum. For the\r\npurpose of this calculation we will suppose it worth three cents per\r\nquart--amounting to eighteen dollars. Is not the second cow, while she\r\nholds out to give it, as good as the first, and three hundred dollars\r\nat interest besides? If the first just pays for her food and\r\nattendance, the second, yielding two-fifths more, pays _forty per\r\ncent. profit_ annually; and yet how many farmers having two such cows\r\nfor sale would make more than ten, or twenty, or at most, thirty\r\ndollars difference in the price? The profit from one is eighteen\r\ndollars a year--in ten years one hundred and eighty dollars, besides\r\nthe annual accumulations of interest--the profit of the other\r\nis--nothing. If the seller has need to keep one, would he not be wiser\r\nto give away the first, than to part with the second for a hundred\r\ndollars?\r\n\r\nSuppose again, that an acre of grass or a ton of hay costs five\r\ndollars, and that for its consumption by a given set of animals, the\r\nfarmer gets a return of five dollars worth of labor, or meat, or wool,\r\nor milk. He is selling his crop at cost, and makes no profit. Suppose\r\nby employing other animals, better horses, better cows, oxen and\r\nsheep, he can get ten dollars per ton in returns. How much are the\r\nlatter worth more than the former? Have they not doubled the value of\r\nthe crops, and increased the profit of farming from nothing to a\r\nhundred per cent? Except that the manure is not doubled, and the\r\nanimals would some day need to be replaced, could he not as well\r\nafford to give the price of his farm for one set as to accept the\r\nother as a gift?\r\n\r\nAmong many, who are in fact ignorant of what goes to constitute merit\r\nin a breeding animal, there is an inclination to treat as imaginary\r\nand unreal the higher values placed upon well-bred animals over those\r\nof mixed origin, unless they are larger and handsomer in proportion to\r\nthe price demanded. The sums paid for qualities which are not at once\r\napparent to the eye are stigmatized as _fancy prices_. It is not\r\ndenied that fancy prices are sometimes, perhaps often paid, for there\r\nare probably few who are not willing occasionally to pay dearly for\r\nwhat merely pleases them, aside from any other merit commensurate to\r\nthe price.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, it is fully as true that great intrinsic\r\nvalue for breeding purposes may exist in an animal and yet make very\r\nlittle show. Such an one may not even look so well to a casual\r\nobserver, as a grade, or cross-bred animal, which although valuable as\r\nan individual, is not, for breeding purposes, worth a tenth part as\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose two farmers to need a bull; they go to seek and two are\r\noffered, both two years old, of similar color, form and general\r\nappearance. One is offered for twenty dollars--for the other a hundred\r\nis demanded. Satisfactory evidence is offered that the latter is no\r\nbetter than any or all of its ancestors for many generations back on\r\nboth sides, or than its kindred--that it is of a pure and distinct\r\nbreed, that it possesses certain well known hereditary qualities, that\r\nit is suited for a definite purpose, it may be a Short-horn, noted for\r\nlarge size and early maturity, it may be a Devon, of fine color and\r\nsymmetry, active and hardy, it may be an Ayrshire, noted for dairy\r\nqualities, or of some other definite breed, whose uses, excellencies\r\nand deficiencies are all well known.\r\n\r\nThe other is of no breed whatever, perhaps it is called a grade or a\r\ncross. The man who bred it had rather confused ideas, so far as he had\r\nany, about breeding, and thought to combine all sorts of good\r\nqualities in one animal, and so he worked in a little grade Durham,\r\nor Hereford to get size, and a little Ayrshire for milk, and a little\r\nDevon for color, and so on, using perhaps dams sired by a bull in the\r\nneighborhood which had also got some \"Whitten\"[1] or \"Peter Waldo\"\r\ncalves, (though none of these showed it,) at any rate he wanted some\r\nof the \"native\" element in his stock, because it was tough, and some\r\nfolks thought natives were the best after all. Among its ancestors and\r\nkindred were some good and some not good, some large and some small,\r\nsome well favored and fat, some ill favored and lean, some profitable\r\nand some profitless. The animal now offered is a great deal better\r\nthan the average of them. It looks for aught they can see, about as\r\nwell as the one for which five times his price is asked. Perhaps he\r\nserved forty cows last year and brought his owner as many quarters,\r\nwhile the other only served five and brought an income of but five\r\ndollars. The question arises, which is the better bargain? After\r\npondering the matter, one buys the low-priced and the other the\r\nhigh-priced one, both being well satisfied in their own minds.\r\n\r\nWhat did results show? The low-priced one served that season perhaps a\r\nhundred cows; more than ought to have done so, came a second\r\ntime;--having been overtasked as a yearling, he lacked somewhat of\r\nvigor. The calves came _of all sorts_, some good, some poor, a few\r\nlike the sire, more like the dams--all mongrels and showing mongrel\r\norigin more than he did. There seemed in many of them a tendency to\r\ncombine the defects of the grades from which he sprung rather than\r\ntheir good points. In some, the quietness of the Short-horn\r\ndegenerated into stupidity, and in others the activity of the Devon\r\ninto nervous viciousness. Take them together they perhaps paid for\r\nrearing, or nearly so. After using him another year, he was killed,\r\nhaving been used long enough.\r\n\r\nThe other, we will say, served that same season a reasonable number,\r\nperhaps four to six in a week, or one every day, not more. Few came a\r\nsecond time and those for no fault of his. The calves bear a striking\r\nresemblance to the sire. Some from the better cows look even better in\r\nsome points, than himself and few much worse. There is a remarkable\r\nuniformity among them; as they grow up they thrive better than those\r\nby the low priced one. They prove better adapted to the use intended.\r\nOn the whole they are quite satisfactory and each pays annually in its\r\ngrowth, labor or milk a profit over the cost of food and attendance of\r\nfive or ten dollars or more. If worked enough to furnish the exercise\r\nneedful to insure vigorous health, he may be as serviceable and as\r\nmanageable at eight or ten years old, as at two; meantime he has got,\r\nperhaps, five hundred calves, which in due time become worth ten or\r\ntwenty dollars each more than those from the other. Which now seems\r\nthe wiser purchase? Was the higher estimate placed on the well bred\r\nanimal based upon fancy or upon intrinsic value?\r\n\r\nThe conviction that a better knowledge of the principles of breeding\r\nwould render our system of agriculture more profitable, and the hope\r\nof contributing somewhat to this end, have induced the attempt to set\r\nforth some of the physiological principles involved in the\r\nreproduction of domestic animals, or in other words, the laws which\r\ngovern hereditary transmission.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Local names for _lyery_, or black fleshed cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF SIMILARITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first and most important of the laws to be considered in this\r\nconnection is that of SIMILARITY. It is by virtue of this law that the\r\npeculiar characters, qualities and properties of the parents, whether\r\nexternal or internal, good or bad, healthy or diseased, are\r\ntransmitted to their offspring. This is one of the plainest and most\r\ncertain of the laws of nature. Children resemble their parents, and\r\nthey do so because these are hereditary. The law is constant. Within\r\ncertain limits progeny always and every where resemble their parents.\r\nIf this were not so, there would be no constancy of species, and a\r\nhorse might beget a calf or a sow have a litter of puppies, which is\r\nnever the case,--for in all time we find repeated in the offspring the\r\nstructure, the instincts and all the general characteristics of the\r\nparents, and never those of another species. Such is the law of nature\r\nand hence the axiom that \"like produces like.\" But while experience\r\nteaches the constancy of hereditary transmission, it teaches just as\r\nplainly that the constancy is not absolute and perfect, and this\r\nintroduces us to another law, viz: that of variation, which will be\r\nconsidered by and by; our present concern is to ascertain what we can\r\nof the law of similarity.\r\n\r\nThe lesson which this law teaches might be stated in five words, to\r\nwit: _Breed only from the best_--but the teaching may be more\r\nimpressive, and will more likely be heeded, if we understand the\r\nextent and scope of the law.\r\n\r\nFacts in abundance show the hereditary tendency of physical, mental\r\nand moral qualities in men, and very few would hesitate to admit that\r\nthe external form and general characteristics of parents descend to\r\nchildren in both the human and brute races; but not all are aware that\r\nthis law reaches to such minute particulars as facts show to be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nWe see hereditary transmission of a peculiar type upon an extensive\r\nscale, in some of the distinct races, the Jews, and the Gypsies, for\r\nexample. Although exposed for centuries to the modifying influences of\r\ndiverse climates, to association with peoples of widely differing\r\ncustoms and habits, they never merge their peculiarities in those of\r\nany people with whom they dwell, but continue distinct. They retain the\r\nsame features, the same figures, the same manners, customs and habits.\r\nThe Jew in Poland, in Austria, in London, or in New York, is the same;\r\nand the money-changers of the Temple at Jerusalem in the time of our\r\nLord may be seen to-day on change in any of the larger marts of trade.\r\nHow is this? Just because the Jew is a \"thorough-bred.\" There is with\r\nhim no intermarriage with the Gentile--no crossing, no mingling of his\r\norganization with that of another. When this ensues \"permanence of\r\nrace\" will cease and give place to variations of any or of all sorts.\r\n\r\nSome families are remarkable during long periods for tall and handsome\r\nfigures and striking regularity of features, while in others a less\r\nperfect form, or some peculiar deformity reappears with equal\r\nconstancy. A family in Yorkshire is known for several generations to\r\nhave been furnished with six fingers and toes. A family possessing the\r\nsame peculiarity resides in the valley of the Kennebec, and the same\r\nhas reappeared in one or more other families connected with it by\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThe thick upper lip of the imperial house of Austria, introduced by\r\nthe marriage of the Emperor Maximillian with Mary of Burgundy, has\r\nbeen a marked feature in that family for hundreds of years, and is,\r\nvisible in their descendants to this day. Equally noticeable is the\r\n\"Bourbon nose\" in the former reigning family of France. All the Barons\r\nde Vessins had a peculiar mark between their shoulders, and it is said\r\nthat by means of it a posthumous son of a late Baron de Vessins was\r\ndiscovered in a London shoemaker's apprentice. Haller cites the case\r\nof a family where an external tumor was transmitted from father to son\r\nwhich always swelled when the atmosphere was moist.\r\n\r\nA remarkable example of a singular organic peculiarity and of its\r\ntransmission to descendants, is furnished in the case of the English\r\nfamily of \"Porcupine men,\" so called from having all the body except\r\nthe head and face, and the soles and palms, covered with hard\r\ndark-colored excrescences of a horny nature. The first of these was\r\nEdward Lambert, born in Suffolk in 1718, and exhibited before the\r\nRoyal Society when fourteen years of age. The other children of his\r\nparents were naturally formed; and Edward, aside from this\r\npeculiarity, was good looking and enjoyed good health. He afterward\r\nhad six children, all of whom inherited the same formation, as did\r\nalso several grand-children.\r\n\r\nNumerous instances are on record tending to show that even accidents\r\ndo sometimes, although not usually, become hereditary. Blumenbach\r\nmentions the case of a man whose little finger was crushed and twisted\r\nby an accident to his right hand. His sons inherited right hands with\r\nthe little finger distorted. A bitch had her hinder parts paralyzed\r\nfor some days by a blow. Six of her seven pups were deformed, or so\r\nweak in their hinder parts that they were drowned as useless. A\r\npregnant cat got her tail injured; in each of her five kittens the\r\ntail was distorted, and had an enlargement or knob near the end of\r\neach. Horses marked during successive generations with red-hot irons\r\nin the same place, transmit visible traces of such marks to their\r\ncolts.\r\n\r\nVery curious are the facts which go to show that acquired habits\r\nsometimes become hereditary. Pritchard, in his \"Natural History of\r\nMan,\" says that the horses bred on the table lands of the Cordilleras\r\n\"are carefully taught a peculiar pace which is a sort of running\r\namble;\" that after a few generations this pace becomes a natural one;\r\nyoung untrained horses adopting it without compulsion. But a still\r\nmore curious fact is, that if these domesticated stallions breed with\r\nmares of the wild herd, which abound in the surrounding plains, they\r\n\"become the sires of a race in which the ambling pace is natural and\r\nrequires no teaching.\"\r\n\r\nMr. T.A. Knight, in a paper read before the Royal Society, says, \"the\r\nhereditary propensities of the offspring of Norwegian ponies, whether\r\nfull or half-bred, are very singular. Their ancestors have been in the\r\nhabit of _obeying the voice_ of their riders and _not the bridle_; and\r\nhorse-breakers complain that it is impossible to produce this last\r\nhabit in the young colts. They are, however, exceedingly docile and\r\nobedient when they understand the commands of their masters.\"\r\n\r\nA late writer in one of the foreign journals, says that he had a \"pup\r\ntaken from its mother at six weeks old, who although never taught to\r\n'beg' (an accomplishment his mother had been taught) spontaneously\r\ntook to begging for every thing he wanted when about seven or eight\r\nmonths old; he would beg for food, beg to be let out of the room, and\r\none day was found opposite a rabbit hutch apparently begging the\r\nrabbits to come and play.\"\r\n\r\nIf even in such minute particulars as these, hereditary transmission\r\nmay be distinctly seen, it becomes the breeder to look closely to the\r\n\"like\" which he wishes to see reproduced. Judicious selection is\r\nindispensable to success in breeding, and this should have regard to\r\n_every particular_--general appearance, length of limb, shape of\r\ncarcass, development of chest; if in cattle, the size, shape and\r\nposition of udder, thickness of skin, \"touch,\" length and texture of\r\nhair, docility, &c., &c.; if in horses, their adaptation to any\r\nspecial excellence depending on form, or temperament, or nervous\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nNot only should care be taken to avoid _structural defects_, but\r\nespecially to secure freedom from _hereditary diseases_, as both\r\ndefects and diseases appear to be more easily transmissible than\r\ndesirable qualities. There is often no obvious peculiarity of\r\nstructure, or appearance, indicating the possession of diseases or\r\ndefects which are transmissible, and so, special care and continued\r\nacquaintance are necessary in order to be assured of their absence in\r\nbreeding animals; but such a tendency although invisible or\r\ninappreciable to cursory observation, must still, judging from its\r\neffects, have as real and certain an existence, as any peculiarity of\r\nform or color.\r\n\r\nEvery one who believes that a disease may be hereditary at all, must\r\nadmit that certain individuals possess certain tendencies which render\r\nthem especially liable to certain diseases, as consumption or\r\nscrofula; yet it is not easy to say precisely in what this\r\npredisposition consists. It seems probable, however, that it may be\r\ndue either to some want of harmony between different organs, some\r\nfaulty formation or combination of parts, or to some peculiar physical\r\nor chemical condition of the blood or tissues; and that this altered\r\nstate, constituting the inherent congenital tendency to the disease,\r\nis duly transmitted from parent to offspring like any other quality\r\nmore readily apparent to observation.\r\n\r\nHereditary diseases exhibit certain eminently characteristic\r\nphenomena, which a late writer[2] enumerates as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. \"They are transmitted by the male as well as by the female\r\n    parent, and are doubly severe in the offspring of parents both\r\n    of which are affected by them.\r\n\r\n    2. They develop themselves not only in the immediate progeny of\r\n    one affected by them, but also in many subsequent generations.\r\n\r\n    3. They do not, however, always appear in each generation in the\r\n    same form; one disease is sometimes substituted for another,\r\n    analogous to it, and this again after some generations becomes\r\n    changed into that to which the breed was originally liable--as\r\n    phthisis (consumption) and dysentery. Thus, a stock of cattle\r\n    previously subject to phthisis, sometimes become affected for\r\n    several generations with dysentery to the exclusion of phthisis,\r\n    but by and by, dysentery disappears to give place to phthisis.\r\n\r\n    4. Hereditary diseases occur to a certain extent independently\r\n    of external circumstances; appearing under all sorts of\r\n    management, and being little affected by changes of locality,\r\n    separation from diseased stock, or such causes as modify the\r\n    production of non-hereditary diseases.\r\n\r\n    5. They are, however, most certainly and speedily developed in\r\n    circumstances inimical to general good health, and often occur\r\n    at certain, so called, critical periods of life, when unusual\r\n    demands on the vital powers take place.\r\n\r\n    6. They show a striking tendency to modify and absorb into\r\n    themselves all extraneous diseases; for example, in an animal of\r\n    consumptive constitution, pneumonia seldom runs its ordinary\r\n    course, and when arrested, often passes into consumption.\r\n\r\n    7. Hereditary diseases are less effectually treated by ordinary\r\n    remedies than other diseases. Thus, although an attack of\r\n    phthisis, rheumatism or opthalmia may be subdued, and the\r\n    patient put out of pain and danger, the tendency to the disease\r\n    will still remain and be greatly aggravated by each attack.\r\n\r\n    In horses and neat cattle, hereditary diseases do not usually\r\n    show themselves at birth, and sometimes the tendency remains\r\n    latent for many years, perhaps through one or two generations\r\n    and afterwards breaks out with all its former severity.\"\r\n\r\nThe diseases which are found to be hereditary in horses are scrofula,\r\nrheumatism, rickets, chronic cough, roaring, ophthalmia or\r\ninflammation of the eye,--grease or scratches, bone spavin, curb, &c.\r\nIndeed, Youatt says, \"there is scarcely a malady to which the horse is\r\nsubject, that is not hereditary. Contracted feet, curb, spavin,\r\nroaring, thick wind, blindness, notoriously descend from the sire or\r\ndam to the foal.\"\r\n\r\nThe diseases which are found hereditary in neat cattle are scrofula,\r\nconsumption, dysentery, diarrhea, rheumatism and malignant tumors.\r\nNeat cattle being less exposed to the exciting causes of disease, and\r\nless liable to be overtasked or exposed to violent changes of\r\ntemperature, or otherwise put in jeopardy, their diseases are not so\r\nnumerous, and what they have are less violent than in the horse, and\r\ngenerally of a chronic character.\r\n\r\nScrofula is not uncommon among sheep, and it presents itself in\r\nvarious forms. Sometimes it is connected with consumption; sometimes\r\nit affects the viscera of the abdomen, and particularly the mesenteric\r\nglands in a manner similar to consumption in the lungs. The scrofulous\r\ntaint has been known to be so strong as to affect the foetus, and\r\nlambs have occasionally been born with it, but much oftener they show\r\nit at an early age, and any affected in this way are liable to fall an\r\neasy prey to any ordinary or prevailing disease which develops in such\r\nwith unusual severity. Sheep are also liable to several diseases of\r\nthe brain and of the respiratory and digestive organs. Epilepsy, or\r\n\"fits,\" and rheumatism sometimes occur.\r\n\r\nSwine are subject to nearly the same hereditary diseases as sheep.\r\nEpilepsy is more common with them than with the latter, and they are\r\nmore liable to scrofula than any other domestic animals.\r\n\r\nWhen properly and carefully managed, swine are not ordinarily very\r\nliable to disease, but when, as too often kept in small, damp, filthy\r\nstyes, and obliged constantly to inhale noxious effluvia, and to eat\r\nunsuitable food, we cannot wonder either that they become victims of\r\ndisease or transmit to their progeny a weak and sickly organization.\r\nSwine are not naturally the dirty beasts which many suppose.\r\n\"Wallowing in the mire,\" so proverbial of them, is rather from a wish\r\nfor protection from insects and for coolness, than from any inherent\r\nlove of filth, and if well cared for they will be comparatively\r\ncleanly.\r\n\r\nThe practice of close breeding, which is probably carried to greater\r\nextent with swine than with any other domestic animal, undoubtedly\r\ncontributes to their liability to hereditary diseases, and when those\r\npossessing any such diseases are coupled, the ruin of the stock is\r\neasily and quickly effected, for as already stated, they are\r\npropagated by either parent, and always most certainly and in most\r\naggravated form, when occurring in both.\r\n\r\nWith regard to hereditary diseases, it is eminently true that \"an\r\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" As a general and almost\r\ninvariable rule, animals possessing either defects or a tendency to\r\ndisease should not be employed for breeding. If, however, for special\r\nreasons it seems desirable to breed from one which has some slight\r\ndefect of symmetry, or a faint tendency to disease, although for the\r\nlatter it is doubtful if the possession of any good qualities can\r\nfully compensate, it should be mated with one which excels in every\r\nrespect in which the other is deficient, and on no account with one\r\nwhich is near of kin to it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the importance due to the subject of hereditary\r\ndiseases, it is also true that few diseases invariably owe their\r\ndevelopment to hereditary causes. Even such as are usually hereditary\r\nare sometimes produced accidentally, (as of course there must be a\r\nbeginning to everything,) and in such case, they may, or may not be,\r\ntransmitted to their progeny. As before shown, it is certain that they\r\nsometimes are, which is sufficient reason to avoid such for breeding\r\npurposes. It is also well known that, in the horse, for instance,\r\ncertain forms of limbs predispose to certain diseases, as bone spavin\r\nis most commonly seen where there is a disproportion in the size of\r\nthe limb above and below the hock, and others might be named of\r\nsimilar character; in all such cases the disease may be caused by an\r\nagency which would be wholly inadequate in one of more perfect form,\r\nbut once existing, it is liable to be reproduced in the offspring--all\r\ntending to show the great importance of _giving due heed_ in selecting\r\nbreeding animals _to all qualities, both external and internal_, so\r\nlong as \"like produces like.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Finlay Dun, V.S., in Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF VARIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider another law, by which that of similarity is\r\ngreatly modified, to wit, the law of variation or divergence. All\r\norganic beings, whether plants or animals, possess a certain\r\nflexibility or pliancy of organization, rendering them capable of\r\nchange to a greater or less extent. When in a state of nature\r\nvariations are comparatively slow and infrequent, but when in a state\r\nof domestication they occur much oftener and to a much greater extent.\r\nThe greater variability in the latter case is doubtless owing, in some\r\nmeasure, to our domestic productions being reared under conditions of\r\nlife not so uniform, and different from, those to which the parent\r\nspecies was exposed in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nFlexibility of organization in connexion with climate, is seen in a\r\nremarkable degree in Indian corn. The small Canada variety, growing\r\nonly three feet high and ripening in seventy to ninety days when\r\ncarried southward, gradually enlarges in the whole plant until it may\r\nbe grown twelve feet high and upwards, and requires one hundred and\r\nfifty days to ripen its seed. A southern variety brought northward,\r\ngradually dwindles in size and ripens earlier until it reaches a type\r\nspecially fitted to its latitude.\r\n\r\nVariation, although the same in kind, is greater in degree, among\r\ndomesticated plants than among animals. From the single wild variety\r\nof the potato as first discovered and taken to Europe, have sprung\r\ninnumerable sorts. Kemp, in his work on Agricultural Physiology, tells\r\nus, that on the maritime cliffs of England, there exists a little\r\nplant with a fusiform root, smooth glaucous leaves, flowers similar to\r\nwild mustard and of a saline taste. It is called by botanists,\r\n_Brassica oleracea_. By cultivation there have been obtained from this\r\ninsignificant and apparently useless plant--\r\n\r\n     1st, all borecoles or kails, 12 varieties or more.\r\n     2d, all cabbages having heart.\r\n     3d, the various kinds of Savoy cabbages.\r\n     4th, Brussels sprouts.\r\n     5th, all the broccolis and cauliflowers which do not heart.\r\n     6th, the rape plant.\r\n     7th, the ruta baga or Swedish turnip.\r\n     8th, yellow and white turnips.\r\n     9th, hybrid turnips.\r\n    10th, kohl rabbi.\r\n\r\nSimilar examples are numerous among our common useful plants, and\r\namong flowers the dahlia and verbena furnish an illustration of\r\ncountless varieties, embracing numberless hues and combinations of\r\ncolor, from purest white through nearly all the tints of the rainbow\r\nto almost black, of divers hights too, and habits of growth, springing\r\nup under the hand of cultivation in a few years from plants which at\r\nfirst yielded only a comparatively unattractive and self-colored\r\nflower. In brief, it may be said, that nearly or quite all the\r\nchoicest productions both of our kitchen and flower gardens are due to\r\nvariations induced by cultivation in a course of years from plants\r\nwhich in their natural condition would scarcely attract a passing\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nWe cannot say what might have been the original type of many of our\r\ndomestic animals, for the inquiry would carry us beyond any record of\r\nhistory or tradition regarding it, but few doubt that all our\r\nvarieties of the horse, the ox, the sheep and the dog, sprang each\r\noriginally from a single type, and that the countless variations are\r\ndue to causes connected with their domestication. Of those reclaimed\r\nwithin the period of memory may be named the turkey. This was unknown\r\nto the inhabitants of the old continent until discovered here in a\r\nwild state. Since then, having been domesticated and widely\r\ndisseminated, it now offers varieties of wide departure from the\r\noriginal type, and which have been nurtured into self-sustaining\r\nbreeds, distinguished from each other by the possession of peculiar\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nAmong what are usually reckoned the more active causes of variation\r\nmay be named climate, food and habit.\r\n\r\nAnimals in cold climates are provided with a thicker covering of hair\r\nthan in warmer ones. Indeed, it is said that in some of the tropical\r\nprovinces of South America, there are cattle which have an extremely\r\nrare and fine fur in place of the ordinary pile of hair. Various other\r\ninstances could be cited, if necessary, going to show that a\r\nbeneficent Creator has implanted in many animals, to a certain extent,\r\na _power of accommodation_ to the circumstances and conditions amid\r\nwhich they are reared.\r\n\r\nThe _supply of food_, whether abundant or scanty, is one of the most\r\nactive cases of variation known to be within the control of man. For\r\nillustration of its effect, let us suppose two pairs of twin calves,\r\nas nearly alike as possible, and let a male and a female from each\r\npair be suckled by their mothers until they wean themselves, and be\r\nfed always after with plenty of the most nourishing food; and the\r\nothers to be fed with skimmed milk, hay tea and gruel at first, to be\r\nput to grass at two months old, and subsequently fed on coarse and\r\ninnutritious fodder. Let these be bred from separately, and the same\r\nstyle of treatment kept up, and not many generations would elapse\r\nbefore we had distinct varieties, or breeds, differing materially in\r\nsize, temperament and time of coming to maturity.\r\n\r\nSuppose other similar pairs, and one from each to be placed in the\r\nrichest blue-grass pastures of Kentucky, or in the fertile valley of\r\nthe Tees; always supplied with abundance of rich food, these live\r\nluxuriously, grow rapidly, increase in hight, bulk, thickness, every\r\nway, they early reach the full size which they are capable of\r\nattaining; having nothing to induce exertion, they become inactive,\r\nlazy, lethargic and fat. Being bred from, the progeny resemble the\r\nparents, \"only more so.\" Each generation acquiring more firmly and\r\nfixedly the characteristics induced by their situation, these become\r\nhereditary, and we by and by have a _breed_ exhibiting somewhat of the\r\ntraits of the Teeswater or Durhams from which the improved Short-horns\r\nof the present day have been reared.\r\n\r\nThe others we will suppose to have been placed on the hill-sides of\r\nNew England, or on the barren Isle of Jersey, or on the highlands of\r\nScotland, or in the pastures of Devonshire. These being obliged to\r\nroam longer for a scantier repast grow more slowly, develop their\r\ncapabilities in regard to size not only more slowly, but, perhaps, not\r\nfully at all--they become more active in temperament and habit,\r\nthinner and flatter in muscle. Their young cannot so soon shift for\r\nthemselves and require more milk, and the dams yield it. Each\r\ngeneration in its turn becomes more completely and fully adapted to\r\nthe circumstances amid which they are reared, and if bred\r\nindiscriminately with any thing and every thing else, we by and by\r\nhave the common mixed cattle of New England, miscalled natives; or if\r\nkept more distinct, we have something approaching the Devon, the\r\nAyrshire, or the Jersey breeds.\r\n\r\nA due consideration of the natural effect of climate and food is a\r\npoint worthy the special attention of the stock-husbandman. If the\r\nbreeds employed be well adapted to the situation, and the capacity of\r\nthe soil is such as to feed them fully, profit may be safely\r\ncalculated upon. Animals are to be looked upon as machines for\r\nconverting herbage into money. Now it costs a certain amount to keep\r\nup the motive power of any machine, and also to make good the wear and\r\ntear incident to its working; and in the case of animals it is only so\r\nmuch as is digested and assimilated, _in addition to the amount thus\r\nrequired_, which is converted into meat, milk or wool; so that the\r\ngreater the proportion which the latter bears to the former, the\r\ngreater will be the _profit_ to be realized from keeping them.\r\n\r\nThere has been in New England generally a tendency to choose animals\r\nof large size, as large as can be had from any where, and if they\r\npossess symmetry and all other good qualities commensurate with the\r\nsize, and if plenty of nutritious food can be supplied, there is an\r\nadvantage gained by keeping such, for it costs less, other things\r\nbeing equal, to shelter and care for one animal than for two. But our\r\npastures and meadows are not the richest to be found any where, and if\r\nwe select such as require, in order to give the profit which they are\r\ncapable of yielding, more or richer food than our farms can supply, or\r\nthan we have the means to purchase, we must necessarily fail to reap\r\nas much profit as we might by the selection of such as could be easily\r\nfed upon home resources to the point of highest profit.\r\n\r\nWhether the selection be of such as are either larger or smaller than\r\nsuit our situation, they will, and equally in both cases, vary by\r\ndegrees towards the fitting size or type for the locality in which\r\nthey are kept, but there is this noteworthy difference, that if larger\r\nones be brought in, they will not only diminish, but deteriorate,\r\nwhile if smaller be brought in, they will enlarge _and improve_.\r\n\r\nThe bestowal of food sufficient both in amount and quality to enable\r\nanimals to develop all the excellencies inherent in them, and to\r\nobtain all the profit to be derived from them, is something very\r\ndistinct from undue forcing or pampering. This process may produce\r\nwonderful animals to look at, but neither useful nor profitable ones,\r\nand there is danger of thus producing a most undesirable variation,\r\nfor, as in plants, we find that forcing, pampering, high culture or\r\nwhatever else it may be called, may be carried so far as to result in\r\nthe production of double flowers, (an unnatural development,) and\r\nthese accompanied with greater or less inability to perfect seed, so\r\nin animals, the same process may be carried far enough to produce\r\nsterility. Instances are not wanting, and particularly among the more\r\nrecent improved Short-horns, of impotency among the males and of\r\nbarrenness in the females, and in some cases where they have borne\r\ncalves they have failed to secrete milk for their nourishment.[3]\r\nImpotency in bulls of various breeds has not unfrequently occurred\r\nfrom too high feeding, and especially if connected _with lack of\r\nsufficient exercise_.[4]\r\n\r\n_Habit_ has a decided influence towards inducing variation. As the\r\nblacksmith's right arm becomes more muscular from the habit of\r\nexercise induced by his vocation, so we find in domestic animals that\r\nuse, or the demand created by habit, is met by a development or change\r\nin the organization adapted to the requirement. For instance, with\r\ncows in a state of nature or where required only to suckle their\r\nyoung, the supply of milk is barely fitted to the requirement. If more\r\nis desired, and if the milk be drawn completely and regularly, the\r\nyield is increased and continued longer. By keeping up the demand\r\nthere is induced in the next generation a greater development of the\r\nsecreting organs, and more milk is given. By continuing the practice,\r\nby furnishing the needful conditions of suitable food, &c., and by\r\nselecting in each generation those animals showing the greatest\r\ntendency towards milk, a breed specially adapted for the dairy may be\r\nestablished. It is just by this mode that the Ayrshires have, in the\r\npast eighty or a hundred years, been brought to be what they are, a\r\nbreed giving more good milk upon a given quantity of food than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt is because the English breeders of modern Short-horns altogether\r\nprefer beef-making to milk-giving properties that they have\r\nconstantly fostered variation in favor of the one at the expense of\r\nthe other until the milking quality in many families is nearly bred\r\nout. It was not so formerly--thirty years ago the Short-horns (or as\r\nthey were then usually called, the Durhams) were not deficient in\r\ndairy qualities, and some families were famous for large yield. By\r\nproperly directed efforts they might, doubtless, be bred back to milk,\r\nbut of this there is no probability, at least in England, for the\r\ntendency of modern practice is very strong toward having each breed\r\nspecially fitted to its use--the dairy breeds for milk and the beef\r\nbreeds for meat only. The requirements of the English breeder are in\r\nsome respects quite unlike those of New England farmers--for instance,\r\nas they employ no oxen for labor there is no inducement to cultivate\r\nworking qualities even, in connection with beef.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the effect of habit, Darwin[5] cites the\r\ndomestic duck, of which he says, \"I find that the bones of the wing\r\nweigh less, and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole\r\nskeleton, than do the same bones in the wild duck; and I presume that\r\nthis change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much\r\nless and walking more than its wild parent.\" And again, \"not a single\r\ndomestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping\r\nears, and the view suggested by some authors, that the drooping is due\r\nto the disuse of the muscles of the ear, from the animals not being\r\nmuch alarmed by danger, seems probable.\"\r\n\r\nClimate, food and habit are the principal causes of variation which\r\nare known to be in any marked degree under the control of man; and the\r\neffect of these is, doubtless, in some measure indirect and\r\nsubservient to other laws, of reproduction, growth and inheritance, of\r\nwhich we have at present very imperfect knowledge. This is shown by\r\nthe fact that the young of the same litter sometimes differ\r\nconsiderably from each other, though both the young and their parents\r\nhave apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life;\r\nfor had the action of these conditions been specific or direct and\r\nindependent of other laws, if any of the young had varied, the whole\r\nwould probably have varied in the same manner.\r\n\r\nNumberless hypotheses have been started to account for variation. Some\r\nhold that it is as much the function of the reproductive system to\r\nproduce individual differences as it is to make the child like the\r\nparents. Darwin says \"the reproductive system is eminently susceptible\r\nto changes in the conditions of life; and to this system being\r\nfunctionally disturbed in the parents I chiefly attribute the varying\r\nor plastic condition of the offspring. The male and female sexual\r\nelements seem to be affected before that union takes place which is to\r\nform a new being. But why, because the re-productive system is\r\ndisturbed this or that part should vary more or less, we are\r\nprofoundly ignorant. Nevertheless we can here and there dimly catch a\r\nfaint ray of light, and we may feel sure that there must be some cause\r\nfor each deviation of structure however slight.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be useless for us to speculate here upon the laws which govern\r\nvariations. The fact that these exist is what the breeder has to deal\r\nwith, and a most important one it is, for it is this chiefly, which\r\nmakes hereditary transmission the problem which it is. His aim should\r\never be _to grasp and render permanent and increase so far as\r\npracticable, every variation for the better, and to reject for\r\nbreeding purposes such as show a downward tendency_.\r\n\r\nThat this may be done, there is abundant proof in the success which\r\nhas in many instances attended the well directed efforts of\r\nintelligent breeders. A remarkable instance is furnished in the new\r\nMauchamp-Merino sheep of Mons. Graux, which originated in a single\r\nanimal, a product of the law of variation, and which by skillful\r\nbreeding and selection has become an established breed of a peculiar\r\ntype and possessing valuable properties. Samples of the wool of these\r\nsheep were shown at the great exhibition in London, in 1851, and\r\nattracted much attention. It was also shown at the great recent\r\nAgricultural Exhibition at Paris. A correspondent of the _Mark Lane\r\nExpress_, says:\r\n\r\n    \"One of the most interesting portions of the sheep-show is that\r\n    of the Mauchamp variety of Merinos, having a new kind of wool,\r\n    glossy and silky, similar to mohair. This is an instance of an\r\n    entirely new breed being as it were created from a mere sport of\r\n    nature. It was originated by Mons. J.L. Graux. In the year 1828,\r\n    a Merino ewe produced a peculiar ram lamb, having a different\r\n    shape from the usual Merino, and possessing a long, straight,\r\n    and silky character of wool. In 1830, M. Graux obtained by this\r\n    ram one ram and one ewe, having the silky character of wool. In\r\n    1831, among the produce were four rams and one ewe with similar\r\n    fleeces; and in 1833 there were rams enough of the new sort to\r\n    serve the whole flock of ewes. In each subsequent year the lambs\r\n    were of two kinds; one possessing the curled elastic wool of the\r\n    old Merinos, only a little longer and finer; the other like the\r\n    new breed. At last, the skillful breeder obtained a flock\r\n    combining the fine silky fleece with a smaller head, broader\r\n    flanks, and more capacious chest; and several flocks being\r\n    crossed with the Mauchamp variety, have produced also the\r\n    Mauchamp-Merino breed. The pure Mauchamp wool is remarkable for\r\n    its qualities as a combing-wool, owing to the strength, as well\r\n    as the length and fineness of the fibre. It is found of great\r\n    value by the manufacturers of Cashmere shawls and similar\r\n    goods, being second only to the true Cashmere fleece, in the\r\n    fine flexible delicacy of the fibre; and when in combination\r\n    with Cashmere wool, imparting strength and consistency. The\r\n    quantity of the wool has now become as great or greater than\r\n    from ordinary Merinos, while the quality commands for it\r\n    twenty-five per cent. higher price in the French market. Surely\r\n    breeders cannot watch too closely any accidental peculiarity of\r\n    conformation or characteristic in their flocks or herds.\"\r\n\r\nMons. Vilmorin, the eminent horticulturist of Paris, has likened the\r\nlaw of similarity to the centripetal force, and the law of variation\r\nto the centrifugal force; and in truth their operations seem\r\nanalogous, and possibly they may be the same in kind, though certainly\r\nunlike in this, that they are not reducible to arithmetical\r\ncalculation and cannot be subjected to definite measurement. His\r\nthought is at least a highly suggestive one and may be pursued with\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nAmong the \"faint rays\" alluded to by Mr. Darwin as throwing light upon\r\nthe changes dependent on the laws of reproduction, there is one,\r\nperhaps the brightest yet seen, which deserves our notice. It is the\r\napparent influence of the male first having fruitful intercourse with\r\na female upon her subsequent offspring by other males. Attention was\r\nfirst directed to this by the following circumstance, related by Sir\r\nEverard Home: A young chestnut mare, seven-eighths Arabian, belonging\r\nto the Earl of Morton, was covered in 1815 by a Quagga, which is a\r\nspecies of wild ass from Africa, and marked somewhat in the style of a\r\nZebra. The mare was covered but once by the Quagga, and after a\r\npregnancy of eleven months and four days gave birth to a hybrid, which\r\nhad, as was expected, distinct marks of the Quagga, in the shape of\r\nits head, black bars on the legs and shoulders, &c. In 1817, 1818 and\r\n1821, the same mare was covered by a very fine black Arabian horse,\r\nand produced successively three foals, and although she had not seen\r\nthe Quagga since 1816, they all bore his curious and unequivocal\r\nmarkings.\r\n\r\nSince the occurrence of this case numerous others of a similar\r\ncharacter have been observed, a few of which may be mentioned. Mr.\r\nMcGillivray says, that in several foals in the royal stud at Hampton\r\nCourt, got by the horse \"Actæon,\" there were unmistakable marks of the\r\nhorse \"Colonel.\" The dams of these foals were bred from by Colonel the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nA colt, the property of the Earl of Suffield, got by \"Laurel,\" so\r\nresembled another horse, \"Camel,\" that it was whispered and even\r\nasserted at Newmarket that he must have been got by \"Camel.\" It was\r\nascertained, however, that the mother of the colt bore a foal the\r\nprevious year by \"Camel.\"\r\n\r\nAlex. Morrison, Esq., of Bognie, had a fine Clydesdale mare which in\r\n1843 was served by a Spanish ass and produced a mule. She afterwards\r\nhad a colt by a horse, which bore a very marked likeness to a\r\nmule--seen at a distance, every one sets it down at once as a mule.\r\nThe ears are nine and one-half inches long,--the girth not quite six\r\nfeet, stands above sixteen hands high. The hoofs are so long and\r\nnarrow that there is a difficulty in shoeing them, and the tail is\r\nthin and scanty. He is a beast of indomitable energy and durability,\r\nand highly prized by his owner.\r\n\r\nNumerous similar cases are on record,[6] and it appears to have been\r\nknown among the Arabs for centuries, that a mare which has first borne\r\na mule, is ever after unfit to breed pure horses;[7] and the fact\r\nseems now to be perfectly well understood in all the mule-breeding\r\nStates of the Union.\r\n\r\nA pure Aberdeenshire heifer, the property of a farmer in Forgue, was\r\nserved with a pure Teeswater bull to which she had a first cross calf.\r\nThe following season the same cow was served with a pure Aberdeenshire\r\nbull, the produce was in appearance a cross-bred calf, which at two\r\nyears old had long horns; the parents were both hornless.\r\n\r\nA small flock of ewes, belonging to Dr. W. Wells in the island of\r\nGrenada, were served by a ram procured for the purpose;--the ewes were\r\nall white and woolly; the ram was quite different,--of a chocolate\r\ncolor, and hairy like a goat. The progeny were of course crosses but\r\nbore a strong resemblance to the male parent. The next season, Dr.\r\nWells obtained a ram of precisely the same breed as the ewes, but the\r\nprogeny showed distinct marks of resemblance to the former ram, in\r\ncolor and covering. The same thing occurred on neighboring estates\r\nunder like circumstances.\r\n\r\nSix very superior pure-bred black-faced horned ewes, belonging to Mr.\r\nH. Shaw of Leochel-Cushnie, were served by a Leicester ram,\r\n(white-faced and hornless.) The lambs were crosses. The next year they\r\nwere served by a ram of exactly the same breed as the ewes themselves.\r\nTo Mr. Shaw's astonishment the lambs were without an exception\r\nhornless and brownish in the face, instead of being black and horned.\r\nThe third year (1846) they were again served by a superior ram of\r\ntheir own breed, and again the lambs were mongrels, but showed less of\r\nthe Leicester characteristics than before. Mr. Shaw at last parted\r\nfrom these fine ewes without obtaining a single pure-bred lamb.[8]\r\n\r\n\"It has been noticed that a well bred bitch, if she have been\r\nimpregnated by a mongrel dog, will not although lined subsequently by\r\na pure dog, bear thorough-bred puppies in the next two or three\r\nlitters.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe like occurrence has been noticed in respect of the sow. \"A sow of\r\nthe black and white breed became pregnant by a boar of the wild breed\r\nof a deep chestnut color. The pigs produced were duly mixed, the color\r\nof the boar being in some very predominant. The sow being afterwards\r\nput to a boar of the same breed as herself, some of the produce were\r\nstill stained or marked with the chestnut color which prevailed in the\r\nfirst litter and the same occurred after a third impregnation, the\r\nboar being then of the same kind as herself. What adds to the force of\r\nthis case is that in the course of many years' observation the breed\r\nin question was never known to produce progeny having the slightest\r\ntinge of chestnut color.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThe above are a few of the many instances on record tending to show\r\nthe influence of a first impregnation upon subsequent progeny by other\r\nmales. Not a few might also be given showing that the same rule holds\r\nin the human species, of which a single one will suffice here:--\"A\r\nyoung woman residing in Edinburgh, and born of white parents, but\r\nwhose mother previous to her marriage bore a mulatto child by a negro\r\nman servant, exhibits distinct traces of the negro. Dr. Simpson, whose\r\npatient at one time, the young woman was, recollects being struck with\r\nthe resemblance, and noticed particularly that the hair had the\r\nqualities characteristic of the negro.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter, in the last edition of his work on physiology, says it\r\nis by no means an infrequent occurrence for a widow who has married\r\nagain to bear children resembling her first husband.\r\n\r\nVarious explanations have been offered to account for the facts\r\nobserved, among which the theory of Mr. McGillivray, V.S., which is\r\nendorsed by Dr. Harvey, and considered (as we shall presently see) as\r\nvery probable at least by Dr. Carpenter, seems the most satisfactory.\r\nDr. Harvey says:\r\n\r\n    \"Instances are sufficiently common among the lower animals where\r\n    the offspring exhibit more or less distinctly over and beyond\r\n    the characters of the male by which they were begotten, the\r\n    peculiarities also of a male by which their mother at some\r\n    former period had been impregnated. * * * Great difficulty has\r\n    been felt by physiological writers in regard to the proper\r\n    explanation of this kind of phenomena. They have been ascribed\r\n    by some to a permanent impression made somehow by the semen of\r\n    the first male on the genitals and more particularly on the ova\r\n    of the female:[11] and by others to an abiding influence exerted\r\n    by him on the imagination and operating at the time of her\r\n    connection subsequently with other males and perhaps during her\r\n    pregnancy; but they seem to be regarded by most physiologists as\r\n    inexplicable.\r\n\r\n    Very recently, in a paper published in the Aberdeen Journal, a\r\n    Veterinary Surgeon, Mr. James McGillivray of Huntley, has\r\n    offered an explanation which seems to me to be the true one. His\r\n    theory is that \"_when a pure animal of any breed has been\r\n    pregnant to an animal of a different breed, such pregnant animal\r\n    is a cross ever after, the purity of her blood being lost in\r\n    consequence of her connection with the foreign animal, herself_\r\n    BECOMING A CROSS FOREVER, _incapable of producing a pure calf of\r\n    any breed_.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Harvey believes \"that while as all allow, a portion of the\r\nmother's blood is continually passing by absorption and assimilation\r\ninto the body of the foetus, in order to its nutrition and\r\ndevelopment, a portion of the blood of the foetus is as constantly\r\npassing in like manner into the body of the mother; that as this\r\ncommingles there with the general mass of the mother's own blood, it\r\ninoculates her system with the constitutional qualities of the foetus,\r\nand that, as these qualities are in part derived to the foetus from\r\nthe male progenitor, the peculiarities of the latter are thereby so\r\ningrafted on the system of the female as to be communicable by her to\r\nany offspring she may subsequently have by other males.\"\r\n\r\nIn support of this view, Mr. McGillivray cites a case in which there\r\nwas presented unmistakable evidence that the organization of the\r\nplacenta admits the return of the venous blood to the mother; and Dr.\r\nHarvey, with much force, suggests that the effect produced is\r\nanalogous to the known fact that constitutional syphilis has been\r\ncommunicated to a female who never had any of the primary symptoms.\r\nRegarding the occurrence of such phenomena, Dr. Harvey under a later\r\ndate says: \"since then I have learned that many among the agricultural\r\nbody in this district are familiar to a degree that is annoying to\r\nthem with the facts then adduced in illustration of it, finding that\r\nafter breeding crosses, their cows though served with bulls of their\r\nown breed yield crosses still or rather mongrels; that they were\r\nalready impressed with the idea of contamination of blood as the cause\r\nof the phenomenon; that the doctrine so intuitively commended itself\r\nto their minds as soon as stated, that they fancied they were told\r\nnothing but what they knew before, so just is the observation that\r\ntruth proposed is much more easily perceived than without such\r\nproposal is it discovered.\"[12]\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter, speaking of phenomena analogous to what are here\r\nalluded to, says:\r\n\r\n\"Some of these cases appear referable to the strong impression left by\r\nthe first male parent upon the female; but there are others which seem\r\nto render it more likely that the blood of the female has imbibed from\r\nthat of the foetus, through the placental circulation, some of the\r\nattributes which the latter has derived from its male parent, and that\r\nthe female may communicate these, with those proper to herself, to the\r\nsubsequent offspring of a different male parentage. This idea is borne\r\nout by a great number of important facts. * * As this is a point of\r\ngreat practical importance it may be hoped that those who have the\r\nopportunity of bringing observation to bear upon it, will not omit to\r\ndo so.\"\r\n\r\nIn the absence of more general and accurate observations directed to\r\nthis point, it is impossible to say to what extent the first male\r\nproduces impression upon subsequent progeny by other males. There can\r\nbe no doubt, however, but that such an impression is made. The\r\ninstances where it is of so marked and obvious a character as in some\r\nof those just related may be comparatively few, yet there is abundant\r\nreason to believe, that although in a majority of cases the effect may\r\nbe less noticeable, it is not less real, and demands the special\r\nattention of all breeders.\r\n\r\nWhether this result is to be ascribed to inoculation of the system of\r\nthe female with the characteristics of the male through the foetus, or\r\nto any other mode of operation, it is obviously of great advantage for\r\nevery breeder to know it and thereby both avoid error and loss and\r\nsecure profit. It is a matter which deserves thorough investigation\r\nand the observations should be minute and have regard not only to\r\npeculiarities of form, but also to qualities and characteristics not\r\nso obvious; for instance there may be greater or less hardiness,\r\nendurance or aptitude to fatten. These may be usually more dependent\r\non the dam, but the male is never without a degree of influence upon\r\nthem, and it is well established that aptitude to fatten is usually\r\ncommunicated by the Short-horn bull to crosses with cattle of mixed or\r\nmongrel origin which are often very deficient in this desirable\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nMr. McGillivray says: \"A knowledge of the fact must be of the greatest\r\nbenefit to the breeder in two ways, positively and negatively. I have\r\nknown very great disappointment and loss result from allowing an\r\ninferior male to serve a first rate female--the usefulness of such\r\nfemale being thereby forever destroyed. As for the positive benefits\r\narising from the inoculation--they are obvious to any unbiased mind.\r\nThe black polled and Aberdeenshire cattle common to this country\r\n(Scotland) may be, and often are, improved by the following plan:\r\nSelect a good, well formed, and healthy heifer--put her, in proper\r\nseason, to a pure Short-horn bull; after the calf to this Durham bull,\r\nbreed from the cow with bulls of her own breed; occasionally, and most\r\nlikely the first time, a red calf ultimately having horns will appear\r\neven from the polled bull and cow; but in general the calves will be\r\nof the same type with the polled parents but with many points\r\nimproved, and an aptitude to fatten, to come earlier to maturity, &c.,\r\nsuch as no one of the pure polled or Aberdeenshire breed ever\r\nexhibited in this country, or any other country, however well kept,\r\nprevious to the introduction of the Short-horn breed. The offspring of\r\nthese breeds thus improved, when bred from again, will exhibit many\r\npoints and qualities of excellence similar to the best crosses but\r\nretaining much of the hardiness of the original stock, no mean\r\nconsideration for this changeable and often severe climate. And,\r\nmoreover, such crosses,--for they are crosses--will command high\r\nprices as improved polled or Aberdeenshire cattle. I happen to know of\r\na case where a farmer, from a distance purchased a two year old\r\nheifer of the stamp referred to, for the purpose of improving his\r\npolled cattle, and for this heifer he paid fifty guineas.\"\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of this law[13] gives us a clue to the cause of many of\r\nthe disappointments of which practical breeders often complain and to\r\nthe cause of many variations otherwise unaccountable, and it suggests\r\nparticular caution as to the first male employed in the coupling of\r\nanimals, a matter which has often been deemed of little consequence in\r\nregard to cattle, inasmuch as fewer heifers' first calves are reared,\r\nthan of such as are borne subsequently.\r\n\r\nAnother faint ray of light touching the causes of variation is\r\nafforded us by the fact that the qualities of offspring are not only\r\ndependent on the habitual conditions of the parents, but also upon any\r\npeculiar condition existing at the time of sexual congress. For\r\ninstance, the offspring of parents ordinarily healthy and temperate,\r\nbut begotten in a fit of intoxication, would be likely to suffer\r\npermanently, both physically and mentally, from the condition which\r\nthe parents had temporarily brought upon themselves. On the other\r\nhand, offspring begotten of parents in an unusually healthy and active\r\ncondition of body and mind, would likely be unusually endowed both\r\nmentally and physically. The Arabs in breeding horses take advantage\r\nof this fact, for before intercourse, both sire and dam are actively\r\nexercised, not to weariness, but sufficiently to induce the most\r\nvigorous condition possible. Of this, too, we have proof in the\r\nphenomenon sometimes observed by breeders, that a strong mental\r\nimpression made upon the female by a particular male, will give the\r\noffspring a resemblance to him, even though she have no sexual\r\nintercourse with him. Of this, Mr. Boswell in his prize essay\r\npublished in 1828, gives a remarkable instance. He says that Mr.\r\nMustard of Angus, one of the most intelligent breeders he had ever met\r\nwith, told him that one of his cows chanced to come into season while\r\npasturing on a field bounded by that of one of his neighbors, out of\r\nwhich field an ox jumped and went with the cow until she was brought\r\nhome to the bull. The ox was white, with black spots, and horned. Mr.\r\nMustard had not a horned beast in his possession, nor one with any\r\nwhite on it. Nevertheless, the produce of the following spring was a\r\nblack and white calf with horns.\r\n\r\nThe case of Jacob is often quoted in support of this view, and\r\nalthough many believe some miraculous agency to have been exerted in\r\nhis case, and though he could say with truth, \"God hath taken away the\r\ncattle of your father and given them to me,\" it seems, on the whole,\r\nmore probable, inasmuch as supernatural agency may never be presumed,\r\nexcept where we know, or have good reason to believe, that natural\r\ncauses are insufficient, that God \"gave\" them, as he now gives to\r\nsome, riches or honors; that is to say, by virtue of the operation of\r\nnatural laws. If all who keep cattle would exercise a tithe of the\r\npatriarch's shrewdness and sagacity in improving their stock, we\r\nshould see fewer ill-favored kine than at present.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of some effect being produced by a strong impression\r\nat the time of conception, is not to be confounded with the popular\r\nerror that \"marks\" upon an infant[14] are due to a transient, although\r\nstrong impression upon the imagination of the mother at any period of\r\ngestation, which is unsupported by facts and absurd; but there are\r\nfacts sufficient upon record to prove that _habitual_ mental\r\ncondition, and especially at an early stage of pregnancy, _may_ have\r\nthe effect to produce some bodily deformity, and should induce great\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] See Rowley's Prize Report on Farming in Derbyshire, in Journal of\r\nRoyal Agricultural Society, Vol. 14.\r\n\r\n[4] A _working bull_, though perhaps not so pleasing to the eye as a\r\nfat one, (for fat sometimes covers a multitude of defects,) is a surer\r\nstock-getter; and his progeny is more likely to inherit full health and\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\n[5] In his Origin of Species.\r\n\r\n[6] It was long ago stated by Haller, that when a mare had a foal by an\r\nass and afterwards another by a horse, the second offspring begotten by\r\nthe horse nevertheless approached in character to a mule.\r\n\r\n[7] See Abd el Kader's letter.\r\n\r\n[8] Journal of Medical Science, 1850.\r\n\r\n[9] Kirke's Physiology.\r\n\r\n[10] Philosophical Transactions for 1821.\r\n\r\n[11] The late M.A. Cuming, V.S., of New Brunswick, once remarked to the\r\nwriter, that it might be due to the fact that the nerves of the uterus,\r\nwhich before the first impregnation were in a rudimentary state, were\r\ndeveloped under a specific influence from the semen of the first male,\r\nand that they might retain so much of a peculiar style of development\r\nas to impress upon future progeny by other males the likeness of the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n[12] Edinburgh Journal Medical Science, 1849.\r\n\r\n[13] A very striking fact may be related in this connection, which\r\nwhile it may or may not have a practical bearing on the breeding of\r\ndomestic animals, shows forcibly how mysterious are some of the laws of\r\nreproduction. It is stated by the celebrated traveler, Count de\r\nStrzelecki, in his Physical Description of New South Wales and Van\r\nDieman's Land. \"Whenever,\" he says, \"a fruitful intercourse has taken\r\nplace between an aboriginal woman and an European male, that aboriginal\r\nwoman is forever after incapable of being impregnated by a male of her\r\nown nation, although she may again be fertile with a European.\" The\r\nCount, whose means and powers of observation are of the highest\r\npossible order, affirms that \"hundreds of instances of this\r\nextraordinary fact are on record in the writer's memoranda all\r\nrecurring invariably under the same circumstances, all tending to prove\r\nthat the sterility of the female, which is relative only to one and not\r\nto the other male is not accidental, but follows laws as cogent though\r\nas mysterious as the rest of those connected with generation.\" The\r\nCount's statement is endorsed by Dr. Maunsell of Dublin, Dr. Carmichael\r\nof Edinburgh, and the late Prof. Goodsir, who say they have learned\r\nfrom independent sources that as regards Australia, Strzelecki's\r\nstatement is unquestionable and must be regarded as the expression of a\r\nlaw of nature. The law does not extend to the negro race, the fertility\r\nof the negro female not being apparently impaired by previous fruitful\r\nintercourse with a European male.\r\n\r\nIn reply to an inquiry made whether he had ever noticed exceptional\r\ncases, the Count says: \"It has not come under my cognizance to see or\r\nhear of a native female which having a child with a European had\r\nafterwards any offspring with a male of her own race.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count's statement is suggestive as to the disappearance of the\r\naborigines of some countries. This has often been the subject of severe\r\ncomment and is generally ascribed to the rum and diseases introduced by\r\nthe white man. It would now appear that other influences have also been\r\noperative.\r\n\r\n[14] Carpenter's Physiology, new edition, page 783.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nATAVISM, OR ANCESTRAL INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may not be easy to say whether this phenomenon is more connected\r\nwith the law of similarity, or with that of variation. Youatt, in his\r\nwork on cattle published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful\r\nKnowledge, inclines to the former. He speaks of it as showing the\r\nuniversality of the application of the axiom that \"like produces\r\nlike\"--that when this \"may not seem to hold good, it is often because\r\nthe lost resemblance to generations gone by is strongly revived.\" The\r\nphenomenon, or law, as it is sometimes called, of atavism,[15] or\r\nancestral influence, is one of considerable practical importance, and\r\nwell deserves careful attention by the breeder of farm stock.\r\n\r\nEvery one is aware that it is nothing unusual for a child to resemble\r\nits grandfather or grandmother or some ancestor still farther back,\r\nmore than it does either its own father or mother. The fact is too\r\nfamiliar to require the citing of examples. We find the same\r\noccurrence among our domestic animals, and oftener in proportion as\r\nthe breeds are crossed or mixed up. Among our common stock of neat\r\ncattle, (_natives_, as they are often called,) originating as they\r\nhave done from animals brought from England, Scotland, Denmark, France\r\nand Spain, each possessing different characteristics of form, color\r\nand use; and bred, as our common stock has usually been,\r\nindiscriminately together, with no special point in view, no attempt\r\nto obtain any particular type or form, or to secure adaptation for any\r\nparticular purpose, we have very frequent opportunities of witnessing\r\nthe results of the operation of this law of hereditary transmission.\r\nSo common indeed is its occurrence, that the remark is often made,\r\nthat however good a cow may be, there is no telling beforehand what\r\nsort of a calf she may have.\r\n\r\nThe fact is sufficiently obvious that certain peculiarities often lie\r\ndormant for a generation or two and then reappear in subsequent\r\nprogeny. Stockmen often speak of it as \"breeding back,\" or \"crying\r\nback.\" The cause of this phenomenon we may not fully understand. A\r\nlate writer says, \"it is to be explained on the supposition that the\r\nqualities were transmitted by the grandfather to the father in whom\r\nthey were _masked_ by the presence of some antagonistic or controlling\r\ninfluence, and were thence transmitted to the son in whom the\r\nantagonistic influence being withdrawn they manifest themselves.\" A\r\nFrench writer on Physiology says, if there is not inheritance of\r\npaternal characteristics, there is at least an _aptitude_ to inherit\r\nthem, a disposition to reproduce them; and there is always a\r\ntransmission of this aptitude to some new descendants, among whom\r\nthese traits will manifest themselves sooner or later.[16] Mr. Singer,\r\nlet us say, has a remarkable aptitude for music; but the influence of\r\nMrs. Singer is such that their children inheriting her imperfect ear,\r\nmanifest no musical talent whatever. These children however have\r\ninherited the disposition of the father in spite of its\r\nnon-manifestation; and if, when they transmit what in them is latent,\r\nthe influence of their wives is favorable, the grand-children may turn\r\nout musically gifted.\r\n\r\nThe lesson taught by the law of atavism is very plain. It shows the\r\nimportance of seeking \"thorough-bred\" or \"well-bred\" animals; and by\r\nthese terms are simply meant such as are descended from a line of\r\nancestors in which for many generations the desirable forms, qualities\r\nand characteristics have been _uniformly shown_. In such a case, even\r\nif ancestral influence does come in play, no material difference\r\nappears in the offspring, the ancestors being all essentially alike.\r\nFrom this stand point we best perceive in what consists the money\r\nvalue of a good \"pedigree.\" It is in the evidence which it brings that\r\nthe animal is descended from a line all the individuals of which were\r\nalike, and excellent of their kind, and so is almost sure to transmit\r\nlike excellencies to its progeny in turn;--not that every animal with\r\na long pedigree full of high-sounding names is necessarily of great\r\nvalue as a breeder, for in every race or breed, as we have seen while\r\nspeaking of the law of variation, there will be here and there some\r\nwhich are less perfect and symmetrical of their kind than others; and\r\nif such be bred from, they may likely enough transmit undesirable\r\npoints; and if they be mated with others possessing similar failings,\r\nthey are almost sure to deteriorate very considerably.\r\n\r\nPedigree is valuable in proportion as it shows an animal to be\r\ndescended, not only from such as are purely of its own race or breed,\r\nbut also from such individuals in that breed as were specially noted\r\nfor the excellencies for which that particular breed is esteemed.\r\nWeeds are none the less worthless because they appear among a crop\r\nconsisting chiefly of valuable plants, nor should deformed or\r\ndegenerate plants, although they be true to their kind, ever be\r\nemployed to produce seed. If we would have good cabbages or turnips,\r\nit is needful to select the most perfect and the soundest to grow seed\r\nfrom, and to continue such selection year after year. Precisely the\r\nsame rule holds with regard to animals.\r\n\r\nThe pertinacity with which hereditary traits cling to the organization\r\nin a latent, masked or undeveloped condition for long after they might\r\nbe supposed to be wholly \"bred out\" is sometimes very remarkable. What\r\nis known among breeders of Short-horns as the \"Galloway alloy,\"\r\nalthough originating by the employment for only once of a single\r\nanimal of a different breed, is said to be traceable even now, after\r\nmany years, in the occasional development of a \"smutty nose\" in\r\ndescendants of that family.\r\n\r\nMany years ago there were in the Kennebec valley a few polled or\r\nhornless cattle. They were not particularly cherished, and gradually\r\ndiminished in numbers. Mr. Payne Wingate shot the last animal of this\r\nbreed, (a bull calf or a yearling,) mistaking it in the dark for a\r\nbear. During thirty-five years subsequently all the cattle upon his\r\nfarm had horns, but at the end of that time one of his cows produced a\r\ncalf which grew up without horns, and Mr. Wingate said it was, in all\r\nrespects, the exact image of the first bull of the breed brought\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nProbably the most familiar exemplification of clearly marked\r\nancestral influence among us, is to be found in the ill-begotten,\r\nround-breeched calves occasionally, and not very unfrequently, dropped\r\nby cows of the common mixed kind, and which, if killed early, make\r\nvery blue veal, and if allowed to grow up, become exceedingly\r\nprofitless and unsatisfactory beasts; the heifers being often sterile,\r\nthe cows poor milkers, the oxen dull, mulish beasts, yielding flesh of\r\nvery dark color, ill flavor and destitute of fat. They are known by\r\nvarious names in different localities, in Maine as the \"Whitten\" and\r\n\"Peter Waldo\" breed, in Massachusetts as \"Yorkshire\" and\r\n\"Westminster,\" in New York as the \"Pumpkin buttocks,\" in England as\r\n\"_Lyery_\" or \"_Lyery_ Dutch,\" &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThose in northern New England are believed to be descended chiefly\r\nfrom a bull brought from Watervliet, near Albany, New York, more than\r\nforty years ago, (in 1818,) by the Shakers at Alfred, in York county,\r\nMaine, and afterwards transferred to their brethren in Cumberland\r\ncounty. No one who has proved the worthlessness of these cattle can\r\nreadily believe that any bull of this sort would have been knowingly\r\nkept for service since the first one brought into the State, and yet\r\nit is by no means a rare occurrence to find calves dropped at the\r\npresent time bearing unmistakable evidence of that origin.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that this disagreeable peculiarity was first brought\r\ninto the country by means of some of the early importations of Dutch\r\nor of the old Durham breed.\r\n\r\nCulley, in speaking of the Short-horns, inclines to the opinion that\r\nthey were originally from Holland, and himself recollected men who in\r\nthe early part of their lives imported Dutch cattle into the county of\r\nDurham, and of one Mr. Dobinson he says, he was noted for having the\r\nbest breed of Short-horns of any and sold at high prices. \"But\r\nafterwards some other persons of less knowledge, going over, brought\r\nhome some bulls that introduced the disagreeable kind of cattle called\r\n_lyery_ or _double lyered_, that is, black-fleshed. These will feed to\r\ngreat weight, but though fed ever so long will not have a pound of fat\r\nabout them, neither within or without, and the flesh (for it does not\r\ndeserve to be called beef) is as black and coarse grained as horse\r\nflesh. No man will buy one of this kind if he knows any thing of the\r\nmatter, and if he should be once taken in he will remember it well for\r\nthe future; people conversant with cattle very readily find them out\r\nby their round form, particularly their buttocks, which are turned\r\nlike a black coach horse, and the smallness of the tail; but they are\r\nbest known to the graziers and dealers in cattle by the _feel_ or\r\n_touch_ of the fingers; indeed it is this nice touch or feel of the\r\nhand that in a great measure constitutes the judge of cattle.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] From the Latin _Atavus_--meaning any ancestor indefinitely, as a\r\ngrandmother's great grandfather.\r\n\r\n[16] \"S'il n'y a pas héritage des caractéres paternels il y a donc au\r\nmoins _aptitude_ à en heriter, disposition à les reproduire, et\r\ntoujours cette transmission de cette aptitude à des noveau descendants,\r\nchez lesquels ces mêmes caractéres se manifesteront tôt ou\r\ntard.\"--_Longet's_ \"_Traite de Physiologie_,\" ii: 133.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nRELATIVE INFLUENCE OF THE PARENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relative influence of the male and female parents upon the\r\ncharacteristics of progeny has long been a fertile subject of\r\ndiscussion among breeders. It is found in experience that progeny\r\nsometimes resembles one parent more than the other,--sometimes there\r\nis an apparent blending of the characteristics of both,--sometimes a\r\nnoticeable dissimilarity to either, though always more or less\r\nresemblance somewhere, and sometimes, the impress of one may be seen\r\nupon a portion of the organization of the offspring and that of the\r\nother parent upon another portion; yet we are not authorized from such\r\ndiscrepancies to conclude that it is a matter of chance, for all of\r\nnature's operations are conducted by fixed laws, whether we be able\r\nfully to discover them or not. The same causes always produce the same\r\nresults. In this case, not less than in others there are, beyond all\r\ndoubt, fixed laws, and the varying results which we see are easily and\r\nsufficiently accounted for by the existence of conditions or modifying\r\ninfluences not fully patent to our observation.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1825, the Highland Society of Scotland, proposed as the\r\nsubject of prize essays, the solution of the question, \"whether the\r\nbreed of live stock connected with agriculture be susceptible of the\r\ngreatest improvement from the qualities conspicuous in the male or\r\nfrom those conspicuous in the female parent?\" Four essays received\r\npremiums. Mr. Boswell, one of the prize writers, maintained that it is\r\nnot only the male parent which is capable of most speedily improving\r\nthe breed of live stock, \"but that the male is the parent which we can\r\nalone look to for improvement.\"\r\n\r\nHis paper is of considerable length and ably written--abounding in\r\nargument and illustrations not easily condensed so as to be given\r\nhere, and it is but justice to add that he also holds that \"before the\r\nbreed of a country can be improved, much more must be looked to than\r\nthe answer to the question put by the Highland Society--such as\r\ncrossing, selection of both parents, attention to pedigree, and to the\r\nfood and care of offspring.\"\r\n\r\nAnd of crossing, he says, \"when I praise the advantage of crossing, I\r\nwould have it clearly understood that it is only to bring together\r\nanimals _not nearly related_ but always of _the same breed_; never\r\nattempting to breed from a speed horse and a draught mare or vice\r\nversa.\" Crossing of breeds \"may do well enough for once, but will end\r\nin vexation, if attempted to be prolonged into a line.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Christian, in his essay, supports the view, that the offspring\r\nbears the greatest resemblance to that parent whether male or female,\r\nwhich has exerted the greatest sway of generative influence in the\r\nformation of the foetus, \"that any hypothesis which would assign a\r\nsuperiority, or set limits to the influence of either sex in the\r\nproduct of generation is unsound and inadmissible,\" and he thus\r\nconcludes--\"as therefore it is unsafe to trust to the qualities of any\r\nindividual animal, male or female, in improving stock, the best bred\r\nand most perfect animals of both sexes should be selected and employed\r\nin propagation; there being, in short, no other certain or equally\r\nefficacious means of establishing or preserving an eligible breed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dallas, in his essay, starts with the idea that the seminal fluid\r\nof the male invests the ovum, the formation of which he ascribes to\r\nthe female; and he supports the opinion, that where external\r\nappearance is concerned, the influence of the male will be discovered;\r\nbut in what relates to internal qualities, the offspring will take\r\nmost from the female. He concludes thus:--\"When color, quality of\r\nfleece, or outward form is wanted, the male may be most depended on\r\nfor these; but when milk is the object, when disposition, hardiness,\r\nand freedom from diseases of the viscera, and, in short, all internal\r\nqualities that may be desired, then the female may be most relied on.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable of these papers was written by the Rev. Henry\r\nBerry of Worcestershire, in which, after stating that the question\r\nproposed is one full of difficulty and that the discovery of an\r\nindependent quality such as that alluded to, in either sex, would be\r\nattended with beneficial results, he proceeds to show, that it is not\r\nto sex, but to high blood, or in other words, to animals long and\r\nsuccessfully selected, and bred with a view to particular\r\nqualifications, whether in the male or female parent, that the quality\r\nis to be ascribed, which the Highland Society has been desirous to\r\nassign correctly.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the prevalent opinion which assigns this power\r\nprincipally to the male, he explains by giving the probable history of\r\nthe first efforts in improving stock. The greatest attention would\r\nnaturally be paid to the male, both on account of his more extended\r\nservices, and the more numerous produce of which he could become the\r\nparent; in consequence of which sires would be well-bred before dams.\r\n\"The ideas entertained respecting the useful qualities of an animal\r\nwould be very similar and lead to the adoption of a general standard\r\nof excellence, towards which it would be required that each male\r\nshould approximate; and thus there would exist among what may be\r\ntermed fashionable sires, a corresponding form and character different\r\nfrom, and superior to, those of the general stock of the country. This\r\nform and character would in most instances have been acquired by\r\n_perseverance in breeding from animals which possessed the important\r\nor fancied requisites_, and might therefore be said to be almost\r\n_confirmed_ in such individuals. Under these circumstances, striking\r\nresults would doubtless follow the introduction of these sires to a\r\ncommon stock; results which would lead superficial observers to\r\nremark, that individual sires possessed properties as _males_, which\r\nin fact were only assignable to them as _improved_ animals.\"\r\n\r\nThe opinion entertained by some, that the female possesses the power\r\ngenerally ascribed to the male, he explains also by a reference to the\r\nhistory of breeding: \"It is well known to persons conversant with the\r\nsubject of improved breeding, that of late years numerous sales have\r\ntaken place of the entire stocks of celebrated breeders of sires, and\r\nthus, the females, valuable for such a purpose, have passed into a\r\ngreat number of hands. Such persons have sometimes introduced a cow so\r\nacquired to a bull inferior in point of descent and general good\r\nqualities, and the offspring is known, in many instances, to have\r\nproved superior to the sire by virtue of the dam's excellence, and to\r\nhave caused a suspicion in the minds of persons not habituated to\r\ncompare causes with effects, that certain females also possess the\r\nproperty in question.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer gives various instances illustrative of his views, in some\r\nof which the male only, and in others the female only, was the\r\nhigh-bred animal, in all of which the progeny bore a remarkable\r\nresemblance to the well-bred parent. He says, that where both parents\r\nare equally well bred, and of nearly equal individual excellence, it\r\nis not probable that their progeny will give general proof of a\r\npreponderating power in either parent to impress peculiar\r\ncharacteristics upon the offspring;--yet in view of all the\r\ninformation we have upon the subject, he recommends a resort to the\r\nbest males as the most simple and efficacious mode of improving such\r\nstocks as require improvement, and the only proceeding by which stock\r\nalready good can be preserved in excellence.\r\n\r\nMon. Giron[17] expresses the opinion that the relative age and vigor\r\nof the parents exercises very considerable influence, and states as\r\nthe results of his observation, that the offspring of an old male and\r\na young female resembles the father less than the mother in\r\nproportion as the mother is more vigorous and the father more\r\ndecrepit, and that the reverse occurs with the offspring of an old\r\nfemale and a young male.\r\n\r\nAmong the more recent theories or hypotheses which have been started\r\nregarding the relative influence of the male and female parents, those\r\nof Mr. Orton, presented in a paper read before the Farmers' Club at\r\nNewcastle upon Tyne, on the Physiology of Breeding, and of Mr. Walker\r\nin his work on Intermarriage, as they both arrived to a certain\r\nextent, at substantially the same conclusions by independent\r\nobservations of their own and as these seem to agree most nearly with\r\nthe majority of observed facts, are deemed worthy of favorable\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of Mr. Orton, briefly stated,[18] are, that in the\r\nprogeny there is no casual or haphazard blending of the parts or\r\nqualities of the two parents, but rather that organization is\r\ntransmitted by halves, or that each parent contributes to the\r\nformation of certain structures, and to the development of certain\r\nqualities. Advancing a step further, he maintains, that the male\r\nparent chiefly determines the external characters, the general\r\nappearance, in fact, the outward structure and locomotive powers of\r\nthe offspring, as the framework, or bones and muscles, more\r\nparticularly those of the limbs, the organs of sense and skin; while\r\nthe female parent chiefly determines the internal structures and the\r\ngeneral quality, mainly furnishing the vital organs, i.e., the heart,\r\nlungs, glands and digestive organs, and giving tone and character to\r\nthe vital functions of secretion, nutrition and growth. \"Not however\r\nthat the male is without influence on the internal organs and vital\r\nfunctions, or the female without influence on the external organs and\r\nlocomotive powers of their offspring. The law holds only within\r\ncertain restrictions, and these form as it were a secondary law, one\r\nof limitations, and scarcely less important to be understood than the\r\nfundamental law itself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Orton relies chiefly on the evidence presented by _hybrids_, the\r\nprogeny of distinct species, or by crosses between the most distinct\r\nvarieties embraced within a single species, to establish his law. The\r\nexamples adduced are chiefly from the former. The _mule_ is the\r\nprogeny of the male ass and the mare; the _hinny_ that of the horse\r\nand the she ass. Both hybrids are the produce of the same set of\r\nanimals. They differ widely, however, in their respective\r\ncharacters--the mule in all that relates to its external characters\r\nhaving the distinctive features of the ass,--the hinny, in the same\r\nrespects having all the distinctive features of the horse; while in\r\nall that relates to the internal organs and vital qualities, the mule\r\npartakes of the character of the horse, and the hinny of those of the\r\nass. Mr. Orton says--\"The mule, the produce of the male ass and mare,\r\nis essentially a _modified ass_: the ears are those of an ass somewhat\r\nshortened; the mane is that of the ass, erect; the tail is that of an\r\nass; the skin and color are those of an ass somewhat modified; the\r\nlegs are slender and the hoofs high, narrow and contracted, like those\r\nof an ass. In fact, in all these respects it is an ass somewhat\r\nmodified. The body and barrel, however, of the mule are round and\r\nfull, in which it differs from the ass and resembles the mare.\r\n\r\nThe hinny, on the other hand, the produce of the stallion and she ass,\r\nis essentially a _modified horse_. The ears are those of a horse\r\nsomewhat lengthened; the mane flowing; the tail bushy, like that of\r\nthe horse; the skin is finer, like that of the horse, and the color\r\nvaries also, like the horse; the legs are stronger and the hoofs broad\r\nand expanded like those of the horse. In fact, in all these respects\r\nit is a horse somewhat modified. The body and barrel, however, of the\r\nhinny are flat and narrow, in which it differs from the horse and\r\nresembles the she ass.\r\n\r\nA very curious circumstance pertains to the voice of the mule and the\r\nhinny. The mule _brays_, the hinny _neighs_. The why and wherefore of\r\nthis is a perfect mystery until we come to apply the knowledge\r\nafforded us by the law before given. The male gives the locomotive\r\norgans, and the muscles are amongst these; the muscles are the organs\r\nwhich modulate the voice of the animal; the mule has the muscular\r\nstructure of its sire, and brays; the hinny has the muscular structure\r\nof its sire, and neighs.\"\r\n\r\nIn connexion with these examples Mr. Orton refers to a special feature\r\nseen equally in the two instances, and which seems at first sight, a\r\ndeparture from the principle laid down by him. It is this, both\r\nhybrids, the mule and the hinny take after the male parents in all\r\ntheir external characters save one, which is _size_. In this respect\r\nthey both follow the female parents, the mule being in all respects a\r\nlarger and finer animal than its sire, the ass; the hinny being in all\r\nrespects a smaller and inferior animal to its sire, the horse, the\r\nbody and barrel of the mule being large and round, those of the hinny\r\nbeing flat and narrow; both animals being in these particulars the\r\nreverse of their respective sires, but both resembling their female\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of this seeming exception is adduced a well known\r\nprinciple in physiology, which is, that the whole bony framework is\r\nmoulded in adaptation to the softer structures immediately related to\r\nit; the muscles covering it in the case of the limbs; and to the\r\nviscera in that of the great cavities which it assists in forming.\r\nAccordingly, in perfect accordance with the views above expressed, the\r\n_general_ size and form which must be mainly that of the _trunk_, will\r\nbe determined by the size and character of the viscera of the chest\r\nand abdomen, and will therefore accord with that of the female parents\r\nby whom the viscera in question are chiefly furnished.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are the most important of Mr. Orton's statements. He\r\ngives, however, numerous additional illustrations from among beasts,\r\nbirds and fishes, of which we quote only the following:\r\n\r\n\"The mule and the hinny have been selected and placed first, because\r\nthey afford the most conclusive evidence and are the most familiar.\r\nEqually conclusive, though perhaps less striking instances, may be\r\ndrawn from other sources. Thus, it has been observed that when the\r\nAncon or Otter sheep were allowed to breed with common ewes, the cross\r\nis not a medium between the two breeds, but that the offspring retains\r\nin a great measure the short and twisted legs of the sire.\"\r\n\r\nBuffon made a cross between the male goat and the ewe; the resulting\r\nhybrid in all the instances, which were many, were strongly\r\ncharacteristic of the male parent, more particularly in the hair and\r\nlength of leg. Curious enough, the number of teats in some of the\r\ncases corresponded with those of the goat.\r\n\r\nA cross between the male wolf and a bitch illustrates the same law;\r\nthe offspring having a markedly wolfish aspect; skin, color, ears and\r\ntail. On the other hand, a cross between the dog and female wolf\r\nafforded animals much more dog-like in aspect--slouched ears and even\r\npied in color. If you look at the descriptions and illustrations of\r\nthese two hybrids, you will perceive at a glance that the doubt arises\r\nto the mind in the case of the first, 'what genus of _wolf_ is this?'\r\nwhereas in the case of the second, 'what a curious _mongrel dog_!'\r\n\r\nThe views of Mr. Walker in his work on Intermarriage, before alluded\r\nto, agree substantially with those of Mr. Orton, _so far as regards\r\ncrossing between different breeds_; but they cover a broader field of\r\nobservation and in some respects differ. Mr. Walker maintains that\r\nwhen both parents are of the _same breed_ that _either parent may\r\ntransmit either half_ of the organization. That when they are of\r\n_different varieties_ or breeds (and by parity of reasoning the same\r\nshould hold, strongly, when hybrids are produced by crossing different\r\n_species_) and supposing also that both parents are of equal age and\r\nvigor, that the _male_ gives the _back head and locomotive organs_ and\r\nthe _female_ the _face and_ nutritive organs--I quote his language:\r\n\"when both parents are of the same variety, _one parent communicates\r\nthe anterior part of the head, the bony part of the face, the forms of\r\nthe organs of sense_ (the external ear, under lip, lower part of the\r\nnose and eye brows being often modified) _and the whole of the\r\ninternal nutritive system_, (the contents of the trunk or the thoracic\r\nand abdominal viscera, and consequently the form of the trunk itself\r\nin so far as that depends on its contents.)\r\n\r\nThe resemblance to that parent is consequently found in the forehead\r\nand bony parts of the face, as the orbits, cheek bones, jaws, chin and\r\nteeth, as well as the shape of the organs of sense and the tone of the\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n_The other parent communicates the posterior part of the head, the\r\ncerebel situated within the skull immediately above its junction with\r\nthe back of the neck, and the whole of the locomotive system_; (the\r\nbones, ligaments and muscles or fleshy parts.)\r\n\r\nThe resemblance to that parent is consequently found in the back head,\r\nthe few more movable parts of the face, as the external ear, under\r\nlip, lower part of the nose, eyebrows, and the external forms of the\r\nbody, in so far as they depend on the muscles as well as the form of\r\nthe limbs, even to the fingers, toes and nails. * *\r\n\r\nIt is a fact established by my observations that in animals of the\r\n_same variety, either the male or the female parent_ may give _either\r\nseries of organs_ as above arranged--that is _either_ forehead and\r\norgans of sense, together with the vital and nutritive organs, _or_\r\nback head, together with the locomotive organs.\"\r\n\r\nTo show that among domesticated animals organization is transmitted by\r\nhalves in the way indicated, and that either parent may give either\r\nseries of organs, he cites among other instances the account of the\r\nAncon sheep. \"When both parents are of the Ancon or Otter breed, their\r\ndescendants inherit their peculiar appearance and proportions of form.\r\nWhen an Ancon ewe is impregnated by a common ram, the progeny\r\nresembles wholly either the ewe or the ram. The progeny of a common\r\newe impregnated by an Ancon ram follows entirely in shape the one or\r\nthe other without blending any of the distinguishing and essential\r\npeculiarities of both.\r\n\r\n'Frequent instances have occurred where common ewes have had twins by\r\nAncon rams; when one exhibited the complete marks and features of the\r\newe and the other of the ram. The contrast has been rendered\r\nsingularly striking when one short legged and one long legged lamb\r\nproduced at a birth have been sucking the dam at the same time.'\r\n\r\nAs the short and crooked legs or those of opposite form, here indicate\r\nthe parent giving the locomotive system, it is evident that one of\r\nthe twins derived it from one parent and the other twin from the other\r\nparent;--the parent not giving it, doubtless communicating in each\r\ncase, the vital or nutritive system.\"\r\n\r\nWhere the parents are of different varieties or species, Mr. Walker\r\nsays, \"The second law, namely, that of CROSSING, operates where each\r\nparent is of a _different breed_, and where, supposing both to be of\r\nequal age and vigor the _male_ gives the _back head_ and _locomotive\r\norgans_, and the _female_ the _face_ and _nutritive organs_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter giving numerous illustrations from facts and many quotations\r\nfrom eminent breeders, he says, \"thus, in crosses of cattle as well as\r\nof horses, the male, except where feebler or of inferior voluntary and\r\nlocomotive power, gives the locomotive system, the female the vital\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nW.C. Spooner, V.S., one of the most eminent authorities of the present\r\nday on this subject, and writing within the past year in the Journal\r\nof the Royal Agricultural Society, says:--\"The most probable\r\nsupposition is, that propagation is done by halves, each parent giving\r\nto the offspring the shape of one half of the body. Thus the back,\r\nloins, hind-quarters, general shape, skin and size follow one parent;\r\nand the fore-quarters, head, vital and nervous system, the other; and\r\nwe may go so far as to add, that the former in the great majority of\r\ncases go with the male parent, and the latter with the female. A\r\ncorroboration of this fact is found in the common system of putting an\r\nordinary mare to a thorough-bred horse; not only does the head of the\r\noffspring resemble the dam but the forelegs likewise, and thus it is\r\nfortunately the case that the too-frequently faulty and tottering legs\r\nof the sire are not reproduced in the foal, whilst the full thighs and\r\nhind quarters which belong to the blood-horse are generally given to\r\nthe offspring. There is however a minority of cases in which the\r\nopposite result obtains. That size is governed more by the male parent\r\nthere is no great difficulty in showing; familiar examples may be\r\nfound in the pony-mare and the full sized horse, which considerably\r\nexceed the dam in size. Again, in the first cross between the small\r\nindigenous ewe and the large ram of another improved breed--the\r\noffspring is found to approach in size and shape very much to the ram.\r\nThe mule offspring of the mare also much resembles both in size and\r\nappearance its donkey sire. These are familiar examples of the\r\npreponderating influence of the male parent, so far as the external\r\nform is considered. To show however that size and hight do not\r\ninvariably follow the male, we need go no further for illustration\r\nthan the human subject. How often do we find that in the by no means\r\nunfrequent case of the union of a tall man with a short woman, the\r\nresult in some instances is that all the children are tall and in\r\nothers all short; or sometimes that some are short and others tall.\r\nWithin our own knowledge in one case, where the father was tall and\r\nthe mother short, the children, six in number, are all tall. In\r\nanother instance, the father being short and the mother tall, the\r\nchildren, seven in number, are all of lofty stature. In a third\r\ninstance, the mother being tall and the father short, the greater\r\nportion of the family are short. Such facts as these are sufficient to\r\nprove that hight or growth does not exclusively follow either the one\r\nparent or the other. Although this is the case, it is also a striking\r\nfact that the union of tall and short parents rarely, if ever,\r\nproduces offspring of a medium size--midway, as it were, between the\r\ntwo parents.\r\n\r\nThus, in the breeding of animals, if the object be to modify certain\r\ndefects by using a male or female in which such defects may not exist,\r\nwe cannot produce this desired alteration; or rather it cannot be\r\nequally produced in all the offspring, but can only be attained by\r\nweeding out those in whom the objectionable points are repeated. We\r\nare, however, of opinion that in the majority of instances, the hight\r\nin the human subject, and the size and _contour_ in animals, is\r\ninfluenced _much more by the male_ than the female parent--and on the\r\nother hand, that the constitution, the chest and vital organs, and the\r\nforehand generally more frequently follow the female.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter, the highest authority in Physiology, says \"it has long\r\nbeen a prevalent idea that certain parts of the organism of the\r\noffspring\" are derived from the male, and certain other parts from the\r\nfemale parent; and although no universal rule can be laid down upon\r\nthis point, yet the independent observations which have been made by\r\nnumerous practical breeders of domestic animals seem to establish that\r\nsuch a _tendency_ has a real existence; the characters of the _animal_\r\nportion of the fabric being especially (but not exclusively) derived\r\nfrom the male parent, and those of the _organic_ apparatus being in\r\nlike manner derived from the female parent. The former will be chiefly\r\nmanifested in the external appearance, in the general configuration of\r\nthe head and limbs, in the organs of the senses (including the skin)\r\nand in the locomotive apparatus; whilst the latter show themselves in\r\nthe size of the body (which is primarily determined by the development\r\nof the viscera contained in the trunk) and in the mode in \"which the\r\nvital functions are performed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole it may be said that the evidence both from observation\r\nand the testimony of the best practical breeders goes to show that\r\neach parent usually contributes certain portions of the organization\r\nto the offspring, and that each has a modifying influence upon the\r\nother. Facts also show that the same parent does not always contribute\r\nthe same portions, but that the order is reversed. Now, as no\r\noperation of nature is by accident, but by virtue of _law_, there must\r\nbe fixed laws here, and there must also be, at times, certain\r\ninfluences at work to modify the action of these laws. Where animals\r\nare of distinct species, or of distinct breeds, transmission is\r\nusually found to be in accordance with the rule above indicated, i.e.\r\nthe male gives mostly the outward form and locomotive system, and the\r\nfemale chiefly the interior system, constitution, &c. Where the\r\nparents are of the same breed, it appears that the portions\r\ncontributed by each are governed in large measure by the condition of\r\neach in regard to age and vigor, or by virtue of individual potency or\r\nsuperiority of physical endowment.\r\n\r\nThis _potency_ or power of transmission seems to be legitimately\r\nconnected with high breeding, or the concentration of fixed qualities\r\nobtained by continued descent for many generations from such only as\r\npossess in the highest degree the qualities desired. On the other hand\r\nit must be admitted that there are exceptional cases not easily\r\naccounted for upon any theory, and it seems not improbable that in\r\nthese the modifying influences may be such as to effect what may\r\napproximate a reconstruction or new combination of the elements, in a\r\nmanner analogous to the chemical changes which we know take place in\r\nthe constituents of vegetables, as for instance, we find that sugar,\r\ngum and starch, substances quite unlike in their appearance and uses,\r\nare yet formed from the same elements and in nearly or precisely the\r\nsame proportions, by a chemistry which we have not yet fathomed.\r\nWhether this supposition be correct or not, there is little doubt that\r\nif we understood fully all the influences at work, and could estimate\r\nfairly all the data to judge from, we might predict with confidence\r\nwhat would be the characteristics of the progeny from any given union.\r\n\r\nPractically, the knowledge obtained dictates in a most emphatic manner\r\nthat every stock-grower use his utmost endeavor to obtain the services\r\nof the best sires; that is, _the best for the end and purposes in\r\nview_--that he depend chiefly on the sire for outward form and\r\nsymmetry--that he select dams best calculated to develop the good\r\nqualities of the male, depending chiefly upon these for freedom from\r\ninternal disease, for hardihood, constitution, and generally for all\r\nqualities dependent upon the vital or nutritive system.\r\n\r\nThe neglect which is too common, and especially in breeding horses, to\r\nthe qualities of the dam, miserably old and inferior females being\r\noften employed, cannot be too strongly censured. In rearing valuable\r\nhorses the dams are not of less consequence than the sires, although\r\ntheir influence upon the progeny be not the same. This is well\r\nunderstood and practiced upon by the Arab, who cultivates endurance\r\nand bottom. If his mare be of the true Kochlani breed he will part\r\nwith her for no consideration whatever, while you can buy his stallion\r\nat a comparatively moderate price. The prevalent practice in England\r\nand America of cultivating speed in preference to other qualities, has\r\nled us to attach greater importance to the male, and the too common\r\nneglect of health, vigor, endurance and constitution in the mares has\r\nin thousands of cases entailed the loss of qualities not less\r\nvaluable, and without which speed alone is of comparatively little\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] In his work, \"De la Generation,\" Paris, 1828.\r\n\r\n[18] Quoted, in part, from a paper by Alex. Harvey, M.D., read before\r\nthe Medical Society of Southampton, June 6th, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the laws which regulate the sex of progeny very little\r\nis known. Many and extensive observations have been made, but without\r\narriving at any definite conclusions. Nature seems to have provided\r\nthat the number of either sex produced, shall be nearly equal, but by\r\nwhat means this result is attained, has not been discovered. Some\r\nphysiologists think the sex decided by the influence of the sire,\r\nothers think it due to the mother. Sir Everard Home believed the\r\n_ovum_ or germ, previous to impregnation to be of no sex, but so\r\nformed as to be equally fitted to become either male or female, and\r\nthat it is the process of impregnation which marks the sex and forms\r\nthe generative organs; that before the fourth month the sex cannot be\r\nsaid to be confirmed, and that it will prove male or female as the\r\ntendency to the paternal or maternal type may preponderate.\r\n\r\nMr. T.A. Knight[19] was of opinion that the sex of progeny depended\r\nupon the influence of the female parent. He says, \"The female\r\nparent's influence upon the sex of offspring in cows, and I have\r\nreason to believe in the females of our other domestic animals, is so\r\nstrong, that it may, I think, be pronounced nearly positive,\" He also\r\nsays, \"I have repeatedly proved that by dividing a herd of thirty cows\r\ninto three equal parts, I could calculate with confidence upon a large\r\nmajority of females from one part, of males from another, and upon\r\nnearly an equal number of males and females from the remainder. I have\r\nfrequently endeavored to change the habits by changing the male\r\nwithout success.\" He relates a case as follows:--\"Two cows brought all\r\nfemale offspring, one fourteen in fifteen years, and the other fifteen\r\nin sixteen years, though I annually changed the bull. Both however\r\nproduced one male each, and that in the same year; and I confidently\r\nexpected, when the one produced a male that the other would, as she\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\nM. Giron, after long continued observation and experiment, stated with\r\nmuch confidence, that the general law upon this point was, that the\r\nsex of progeny would depend on the greater or less relative vigor of\r\nthe individuals coupled. In many experiments purposely made, he\r\nobtained from ewes more males than females by coupling very strong\r\nrams with ewes either too young, or too aged, or badly fed, and more\r\nfemales than males by a reverse choice in the ewes and rams he put\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nMon. Martegoute, formerly Professor of Rural Economy, in a late\r\ncommunication to the \"Journal D'Agriculture Pratique,\" says that as\r\nthe result of daily observations at a sheepfold of great importance,\r\nthat of the Dishley Mauchamp Merinos of M. Viallet at Blanc, he has,\r\nif not deceived, obtained some new hints. He states that Giron's law\r\ndeveloped itself regularly at the sheepfold in all cases where\r\ndifference of vigor was observed in the ewes or rams which were\r\ncoupled; but he adds another fact, which he had observed every year\r\nsince 1853, when his observations began. This fact consists--\r\n\r\n_First_, In that at the commencement of the rutting season when the\r\nram is in his full vigor he procreated more males than females.\r\n\r\n_Second_, When, some days after, and the ewes coming in heat in great\r\nnumbers at once, the ram being weakened by a more frequent renewal of\r\nthe exertion, the procreation of females took the lead.\r\n\r\n_Third_, The period of excessive exertion having passed, and the\r\nnumber of ewes in heat being diminished, the ram also found less\r\nweakened, the procreation of males in majority again commenced.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to show that the cause of such a result is isolated from all\r\nother influences of a nature to be confounded with it, he gives the\r\ndetails of his observations in a year when the number of births of\r\nmales and females were about equal. He also goes on to say, that, \"at\r\nthe end of each month all the animals at the sheepfold are weighed\r\nseparately, and thanks to these monthly weighings, we have drawn up\r\nseveral tables from which are seen the diminution or increase in\r\nweight of the different animals classed in various points of view,\r\nwhether according to age, sex or the object for which they were\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nTwo of these tables have been appropriated to bearing ewes--one to\r\nthose which have borne and nursed males and the other to those which\r\nhave borne and brought up females. The abstract results of these two\r\ntables have furnished two remarkable facts.\r\n\r\n_First_, The ewes that have produced the female lambs are, on an\r\naverage, of a weight superior to those that produced the males; and\r\nthey evidently lose more in weight than these last during the suckling\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n_Second_, The ewes that produce males weigh less, and do not lose in\r\nnursing so much as the others.\r\n\r\nIf the indications given by these facts come to be confirmed by\r\nexperiments sufficiently repeated, two new laws will be placed by the\r\nside of that which Giron de Bazareingues has determined by his\r\nobservations and experiments. On the one hand, as, at liberty, or in\r\nthe savage state, it is a general rule that the predominance in acts\r\nof generation belongs to the strongest males to the exclusion of the\r\nweak, and as such a predominance is favorable to the procreation of\r\nthe male sex, it would follow that the number of males would tend to\r\nsurpass incessantly that of the females, amongst whom no want of\r\nenergy or power would turn aside from generation, and the species\r\nwould find in it a fatal obstacle to its reproduction. But, on the\r\nother hand, if it was true that the strongest females and the best\r\nnurses amongst them produce females rather than males, nature would\r\nthus oppose a contrary law, which would establish the equilibrium, and\r\nby an admirable harmony would secure the perfection and preservation\r\nof the species, by confiding the reproduction of either sex to the\r\nmost perfect type of each respectively.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] Philosophical Transactions, 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nIN-AND-IN BREEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been a disputed point whether the system of breeding\r\n_in-and-in_ or the opposite one of frequent crossing has the greater\r\ntendency to maintain or improve the character of stock. The advocates\r\nof both systems are earnest and confident of being in the right. The\r\ntruth probably is, as in some other similar disputes, that both are\r\nright and both wrong--to a certain extent, or within certain limits.\r\n\r\nThe term _in-and-in_ is often very loosely used and is variously\r\nunderstood; some, and among these several of the best writers, confine\r\nthe phrase to the coupling of those of exactly the same blood, i.e.\r\nbrothers and sisters; while others include in it breeding from parents\r\nand offspring, and others still employ the term to embrace those of\r\nmore distant relationship. For the latter, the term breeding in, or\r\nclose breeding, is deemed more fitting.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent opinion is decidedly against the practice of breeding\r\nfrom any near relationships; it being usually found that degeneracy\r\nfollows, and often to a serious degree; but it is not proved that\r\nthis degeneracy, although very common and even usual, is yet a\r\nnecessary consequence. That ill effects follow in a majority of cases\r\nis not to be doubted, but this is easily and sufficiently accounted\r\nfor upon other grounds. In a state of nature animals of near\r\naffinities interbreed without injurious results, and it is found by\r\nexperience that where domesticated animals are of a pure race, or of a\r\ndistinct, well defined and pure breed, the coupling of those of near\r\naffinities is not so often followed by injurious effects as when they\r\nare crosses, or of mixed or mongrel origin, like the great majority of\r\nthe cattle in the country at large. In the latter case breeding\r\nin-and-in is _usually_ found to result in decided and rapid\r\ndeterioration. We should consider also that few animals in a state of\r\ndomestication are wholly free from hereditary defects and diseases,\r\nand that these are propagated all the more readily and surely when\r\npossessed by both parents, and that those nearly related are more\r\nlikely than others, to possess similar qualities and tendencies.\r\n\r\nIf such is to be regarded as the true explanation, it follows that the\r\nsame method would be also efficacious in perpetuating and confirming\r\ngood qualities. Such is the fact; and it is well known that nearly all\r\nwho have achieved eminence as breeders, have availed themselves\r\nfreely of its benefits. Bakewell, the Messrs. Colling, Mr. Mason, Mr.\r\nBates and others, all practiced it. Mr. Bates' rule was, \"breed\r\nin-and-in from a bad stock and you cause ruin and devastation, they\r\nmust always be changing to keep even moderately in caste; but _if a\r\ngood stock_ be selected, you may breed in-and-in as much as you\r\nplease.\"[20] Bakewell originated his famous sheep by crossing from the\r\nbest he could gather from far or near; but when he had obtained such\r\nas suited him, he bred exclusively from within his own. As in all\r\nbreeding from crosses, it was needful to throw out as weeds, a large\r\nproportion of the progeny, but by rigidly doing so, and saving none to\r\nbreed from but such as became more and more firmly possessed of the\r\nforms and qualities desired, the weeds gradually became fewer, until\r\nat length he fully established the breed; and he continued it, and\r\nsustained its high reputation during his life by in-breeding\r\n_connected with proper selections for coupling_. After his death,\r\nothers, not possessing his tact and judgment in making selections,\r\nwere less fortunate, and in some hands the breed degenerated\r\nseriously, insomuch that it was humorously remarked, \"there was\r\nnothing but a little tallow left.\" In others it has been maintained by\r\nthe same method. Mr. Valentine Barford of Foscote, has the pedigree\r\nof his Leicester sheep since the day of Bakewell, in 1783, and since\r\n1810, he has bred entirely from his own flock, sire and dam, without\r\nan inter-change of male or female from any other flock. He observes\r\n\"that his flock being bred from the nearest affinities--commonly\r\ncalled in-and-in breeding--has not experienced any of the ill effects\r\nascribed to the practice.\" W.C. Spooner, V.S., speaking of Mr.\r\nBarford's sheep says, \"His flock is remarkably healthy and his rams\r\nsuccessful, but his sheep are small.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Colling, after he procured the famous bull Hubback,\r\nselected cows most likely to develop his special excellencies, and\r\nfrom the progeny of these he bred very closely. From that day to this,\r\nthe Short-horns as a general thing, have been very closely bred,[21]\r\nand the practice has been carried so far, the selections not always\r\nbeing the most judicious possible, as to result in many cases in\r\ndelicacy of constitution, and in some where connected with pampering,\r\nin sterility.[22]\r\n\r\nCol. Jaques, of the Ten Hills Farm near Boston, imported a pair of\r\nBremen geese in 1822. They were bred together till 1830, when the\r\ngander was accidentally killed. Since then the goose bred with her\r\noffspring till she was killed by an attack of dogs in 1852. Great\r\nnumbers were bred during this time, and of course there was much of\r\nthe closest breeding, yet there was no deterioration, and in fact\r\nsome of the later ones were larger and better than the first pair.\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman also obtained a pair of wild geese from Canada in\r\n1818, which with their progeny were bred from without change until\r\ndestroyed by dogs with the above named in 1852. They continued perfect\r\nas at first.\r\n\r\nAmong gregarious ruminating animals in a state of nature, all who\r\nassociate in a herd acknowledge a chieftain, or head, who maintains\r\nhis position by virtue of physical health, strength and general\r\nsuperiority. He not only directs all their movements but is literally\r\nthe father of the herd. When a stronger than he comes, the post of\r\nchieftain and sire is yielded, but in all probability his successor is\r\none of his own sons, who in turn begets offspring by his sisters. The\r\nprogeny inheriting full health, strength and development, the herd\r\ncontinues in full power and vigor,[23] and does not degenerate as\r\noften happens when man assumes to make the selections, and chooses\r\naccording to fancy or convenience. The continuance of health, strength\r\nand perfect physical development is believed to depend on the _wisdom\r\nof the selection, upon the presence of the desirable hereditary\r\nqualities, and the absence of injurious ones_, and not upon\r\nrelationship whether near or remote.\r\n\r\nIt has fallen within the observation of most persons that in the human\r\nrace frequent intermarriages in the same family for successive\r\ngenerations often tend to degeneracy of both mind and body; size and\r\nvigor diminishing, and constitutional defects and diseases being\r\nperpetuated and aggravated; but neither in this case is the result\r\nbelieved to be a necessary and inevitable consequence. Else how could\r\nit be, that Infinite Wisdom, whose operations are ever in accordance\r\nwith the laws of his own institution, in originating a \"peculiar\r\npeople,\" chosen to be the depositories of intellectual and physical\r\npower, wealth and influence, and who, in spite of oppression without\r\nparallel in the world's history, have ever maintained the possession\r\nof a goodly share of all these,--would have allowed their first\r\nprogenitor, Abraham, to marry his near kinswoman Sarah, a half sister,\r\nniece or cousin, and Isaac their son to wed his first cousin Rebecca,\r\nand Jacob who sprang from that union, to marry first cousins, and\r\ntheir offspring for long generations to intermarry within their own\r\npeople and tribes alone? At a later period, marriages within certain\r\ndegrees of consanguinity were forbidden by Divine authority, but not\r\nuntil the peculiar race was fully established, and so far multiplied,\r\nas to allow departure from close breeding without change of\r\ncharacteristics, and not improbably the prohibition was even then\r\nbased more upon moral reasons, or upon man's ignorance or recklessness\r\nregarding selection, than upon physical law.\r\n\r\nSuch laws exist among us at present, and it is well they do, inasmuch\r\nas for the reasons already given there is greater probability of\r\ndegeneracy by means of such connections than among those not so\r\nrelated by blood. But they present an instance of the imperfection of\r\nhuman laws, it being impossible for any legal enactments to prevent\r\nwholly the evil thus sought to be avoided. It would be better far, if\r\nsuch a degree of physiological knowledge existed and such caution was\r\nexercised among the community generally, as would prevent the\r\ncontraction of any marriages, where, from the structure and endowments\r\nof the parties, debility, deformity, insanity or idiocy must\r\ninevitably be the portion of their offspring whether they are more\r\nnearly related than through their common ancestor, Noah, or not.\r\n\r\nIf we adopt Mr. Walker's views, it is easy to see how parents of near\r\naffinities may produce offspring perfect and healthy, or the reverse.\r\nHe holds, that to secure satisfactory results from any union, there\r\nshould be some inherent, constitutional, or fundamental difference;\r\nsome such difference as we often see in the human family to be the\r\nground of preference and attachment; as men generally prefer women of\r\na feminine rather than a masculine type. All desire, in a mate,\r\nproperties and qualities not possessed by themselves. Now assuming as\r\nMr. Walker holds, that organization is transmitted by halves, and\r\nthat, in animals of the same variety, either parent may give either\r\nseries of organs, we can see in the case of brother and sister that if\r\none receives the locomotive system of the father and the nutritive\r\nsystem of the mother, and the other the locomotive system of the\r\nmother and the nutritive system of the father, they are essentially\r\nunlike, there is scarcely any similarity between them, although, as we\r\nsay, of precisely the same blood; and their progeny if coupled might\r\nshow no deterioration; whereas, if both have the same series of organs\r\nfrom the same parents, they would be essentially the same, a sort of\r\nquasi identity would exist between them, and they are utterly unfit to\r\nbe mated. There might be impotency, or barrenness, or the progeny, if\r\nany, would be decidedly inferior to the parents; and the same applies,\r\nmore or less, to other relatives descended from a common ancestry, but\r\nmore distant than brother and sister. Mr. Walker also holds that\r\nwhere the parents are not only of the same variety but of the same\r\nfamily in the narrowest sense, the female always gives the locomotive\r\nsystem and the father the nutritive; in which case the progeny is\r\nnecessarily inferior to the parents.\r\n\r\nA careful consideration of the subject brings us to the following\r\nconclusions, viz:\r\n\r\nThat in general practice, with the grades and mixed animals common in\r\nthe country, _close breeding should be scrupulously avoided_ as highly\r\ndetrimental. It is better _always_ to avoid breeding from near\r\naffinities whenever stock-getters of the same breed and of equal merit\r\ncan be obtained which are not related. Yet, where this is not\r\npossible, or where there is some desirable and clearly defined purpose\r\nin view, as the fixing and perpetuating of some valuable quality in a\r\nparticular animal not common to the breed, and the breeder possesses\r\nthe knowledge and skill needful to accomplish his purpose, and the\r\nanimals are perfect in health and development, close breeding may be\r\npracticed with advantage.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] Mr. Bates, although eminent as a breeder, was not infallible in\r\nmaking his selections, and after long continued close breeding, he was\r\ncompelled to go out of his own herd to procure breeding animals.\r\n\r\n[21] Probably few who have not critically examined the facts regarding\r\nclose breeding in the improved Short-horns are aware of the extent to\r\nwhich it has been carried. On the 28th of March, 1860, at a sale of\r\nShort-horns at Milcote, near Stratford upon Avon (England) thirty-one\r\ndescendants of a cow called \"Charmer,\" bred of Mr. Colling's purest\r\nblood, and praised in the advertisement as \"capital milkers and very\r\nprolific, _not having been pampered_,\" sold for £2,140, averaging about\r\n$350 each, and many of them were calves. The stock was also praised as\r\n\"offering to the public as much of the pure blood of 'Favorite' as\r\ncould be found in any herd.\" With reference to this sale, which also\r\ncomprised other stock, the Agricultural Gazette, published a few days\r\nprevious, had some remarks from which the following is extracted:\r\n\r\n\"It is unquestionable that the ability of a cow or bull to transmit the\r\nmerit either may possess does in a great degree depend upon its having\r\nbeen inherited by them through a long line of ancestry. Nothing is more\r\nremarkable than the way in which the earlier improvers of the\r\nShort-horn breed carried out their belief in this. They were indeed\r\ndriven by the comparative fewness of well bred animals to a repeated\r\nuse of the same sire on successive generations of his own begetting,\r\nwhile breeders now-a-days have the advantage of fifty different strains\r\nand families from which to choose the materials of their herd, but\r\nwhether it were necessity or choice it is certain that the pedigree of\r\nno pure bred Short-horn can be traced without very soon reaching many\r\nan illustration of the way in which 'breeding in-and-in' has influenced\r\nits character, deepened it, made it permanent, so that it is handed\r\ndown unimpaired and even strengthened in the hands of the judicious\r\nbreeder. What an extraordinary influence has thus been exerted by a\r\nsingle bull on the fortunes of the Short-horn breed! There is hardly a\r\nsingle choice pure-bred Short-horn that is not descended from\r\n'Favorite' (252) and not only descended in a single line--but descended\r\nin fifty different lines. Take any single animal, and this bull shall\r\noccur in a dozen of its preceding generations and repeatedly up to a\r\nhundred times! in the animals of some of the more distant generations.\r\nHis influence is thus so paramount in the breed that one fancies he has\r\ncreated it and that the present character of the whole breed is due the\r\n'accidental' appearance of an animal of extraordinary endowments on the\r\nstage in the beginning of the present century. And yet this is not\r\nso;--he is himself an illustration of the breeding in-and-in\r\nsystem--his sire and dam having been half brother and sister, both got\r\nby 'Foljambe.' And this breeding in-and-in has handed down his\r\ninfluence to the present time in an extraordinary degree. Take for\r\ninstance, the cow 'Charmer,' from which as will be seen elsewhere, no\r\nfewer than thirty-one descendants are to be sold next Wednesday. She\r\nhad of course two immediate parents, four progenitors in the second\r\ngeneration, eight in the third, sixteen in the fourth, the number\r\nnecessarily doubling each step farther back. Of the eight bulls named\r\nin the fourth generation from which she was descended, one was by\r\n'Favorite.' She is one-sixteenth 'Favorite' on that account, but the\r\ncow to which he was then put was also descended from 'Favorite,' and so\r\nare each of the other seven bulls and seven cows which stand on the\r\nsame level of descent with the gr. gr. g. dam of 'Charmer.' And in fact\r\nit will be found on examination that in so far as 'Charmer's' pedigree\r\nis known, which it is in some instances to the sixteenth generation,\r\nshe is not one-sixteenth only but nearly nine-sixteenths of pure\r\nFavorite blood. This arises from 'Favorite' having been used repeatedly\r\non cows descended from himself. In the pedigree of 'Charmer' we\r\nrepeatedly meet with 'Comet'--'Comet' was by 'Favorite' and his dam\r\n'Young Phoenix' was also by 'Favorite;' with 'George'--'George' was by\r\n'Favorite' and his dam 'Lady Grace' was also by 'Favorite;' with\r\n'Chilton'--'Chilton' was by 'Favorite' and his dam was also by\r\n'Favorite;' with 'Minor'--'Minor' was by 'Favorite' and his dam also\r\nwas by 'Favorite;' with 'Peeress'--she was by 'Favorite' and her dam\r\nalso by 'Favorite;' with 'Bright Eyes'--she was by 'Favorite' and her\r\ndam also by 'Favorite;' with 'Strawberry'--she was by 'Favorite' and\r\nher dam by 'Favorite;' 'Dandy,' 'Moss Rose,' among the cows and 'North\r\nStar' among the bulls are also of similar descent.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty therefore in understanding how this name appears\r\nrepeatedly in any given generation of the pedigree of any given animal\r\nof the Short-horn breed.\"\r\n\r\n[22] Journal Royal Agricultural Society, volume 20, page 297.\r\n\r\n[23] It may be said with truth, that the average health and vigor of a\r\nwild herd is much higher than it would be if the feebler portion of the\r\nyoung were reared, as in a state of domestication, instead of being\r\ndestroyed by the stronger, or perishing from hardship; but if close\r\nbreeding be, of itself and necessarily, injurious, the whole herd\r\nshould gradually fail, which is not found to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCROSSING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of crossing, like that of close breeding, has its strong\r\nand its weak side. Substantial arguments can be brought both in its\r\nfavor and against it. Judiciously practiced, it offers a means of\r\nprocuring animals _for the butcher_, often superior to and more\r\nprofitable than those of any pure breed. It is also admissible as the\r\nfoundation of a systematic and well considered attempt to establish a\r\nnew breed. Such attempts, however, as they necessarily involve\r\nconsiderable expense, and efforts continued during a long term of\r\nyears, will be rarely made. But when crossing is practiced\r\ninjudiciously and indiscriminately, and especially when so done for\r\nthe purpose of procuring _breeding animals_, it cannot be too severely\r\ncensured, and is scarcely less objectionable than careless in-and-in\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks, from the pen of W.C. Spooner, V.S., are\r\nintroduced as sound and reliable, and as comprising nearly all which\r\nneed be said on the subject of crossing breeds possessing distinctive\r\ncharacteristics:\r\n\r\n    \"Crossing is generally understood to refer to the alliance of\r\n    animals of different breeds, such as between a thorough-bred and\r\n    a half-bred among horses or a South Down and Leicester among\r\n    sheep. Now the advantages or disadvantages of this system depend\r\n    entirely on the object we have in view, whether merely to beget\r\n    an animal for the butcher, or for the purpose of perpetuating\r\n    the species. If the latter is the object, then crossing should\r\n    be adopted gradually and with care, and by no means between\r\n    distant or antagonistic qualities, as for example a\r\n    thorough-bred and a cart-horse. The result of the latter\r\n    connection is generally an ill-assorted and unfavorable animal,\r\n    too heavy perhaps for one purpose, and too light for another. If\r\n    we wish to instil more activity into the cart-horse breed, it is\r\n    better to do so by means of some half-bred animal, whilst the\r\n    latter can be improved by means of the three-parts-bred horse\r\n    and this again by the thorough-bred. There is a remarkable\r\n    tendency, in breeding, for both good qualities and bad to\r\n    disappear for one or two generations, and to reappear in the\r\n    second and third; thus an animal often resembles the grand dam\r\n    more than the dam. This peculiarity is itself an objection to\r\n    the practice of crossing, as it tends to prevent uniformity and\r\n    to encourage contrarieties; and thus we find in many flocks and\r\n    herds that the hopes of the breeders have been entirely baffled\r\n    and a race of mongrels established.\r\n\r\n    The first cross is generally successful--a tolerable degree of\r\n    uniformity is produced, resembling in external conformation the\r\n    sire, which is usually of a superior breed; and thus the\r\n    offspring are superior to the dams. These cross-bred animals are\r\n    now paired amongst each other, and what is the consequence?\r\n    Uniformity at once disappears; some of the offspring resemble\r\n    the grandsire, and others the grandams, and some possess the\r\n    disposition and constitution of the one and some of the other;\r\n    and consequently a race of mongrels is perpetuated. If, however,\r\n    the cross is really a good and desirable one, then, by means of\r\n    rigorous and continued selection, pursued for several\r\n    generations, that is, by casting aside, as regards breeding\r\n    purposes, every animal that does not exhibit uniformity, or\r\n    possess the qualifications we are desirous of perpetuating, a\r\n    valuable breed of animals may in the course of time be\r\n    established. By this system many varieties of sheep have been so\r\n    far improved as to become almost new breeds; as for instance the\r\n    New Oxford Downs which have frequently gained prizes at the\r\n    great Agricultural Meetings as being the best long wooled sheep.\r\n\r\n    To cross, however, merely for crossing sake--to do so without\r\n    that care and vigilance which we have deemed so essential--is a\r\n    practice which cannot be too much condemned. It is in fact a\r\n    national evil and a sin against society, that is, if carried\r\n    beyond the first cross, or if the cross-bred animals are used\r\n    for breeding. A useful breed of animals may thus be lost, and a\r\n    generation of mongrels established in their place, a result\r\n    which has followed in numerous instances amongst every breed of\r\n    animals.\r\n\r\n    The principal use of crossing, however, is to raise animals for\r\n    the butcher. In this respect it has not (with sheep) been\r\n    adopted to the extent which it might to advantage. The male\r\n    being generally an animal of a superior breed and of a vigorous\r\n    nature, almost invariably stamps his external form, size and\r\n    muscular development on the offspring, which thus bear a strong\r\n    resemblance to him, whilst their internal nature derived from\r\n    the dam, well adapts them to the locality, as well as to the\r\n    treatment to which their dams have been accustomed.\r\n\r\n    With regard to cattle, the system cannot be so advantageously\r\n    pursued (except for the purpose of improving the size and\r\n    qualities of the calf, where veal is the object) in as much as\r\n    every required qualification for breeding purposes can be\r\n    obtained by using animals of the pure breeds. But with sheep,\r\n    where the peculiarities of the soil as regards the goodness of\r\n    feed, and exposure to the severities of the weather, often\r\n    prevent the introduction of an improved breed, the value of\r\n    using a new and superior ram is often very considerable, and the\r\n    weight of mutton is materially increased, without its quality\r\n    being impaired, while earlier maturity is at the same time\r\n    obtained. It involves, however, more systematic attention than\r\n    farmers usually like to bestow, for it is necessary to employ a\r\n    different ram for each purpose; that is, a native ram for a\r\n    portion of the ewes to keep up the purity of the breed, and a\r\n    foreign ram to raise the improved cross-bred animals for fatting\r\n    either as lambs or sheep. This plan is adopted by many breeders\r\n    of Leicester sheep, who thus employ South Down rams to improve\r\n    the quality of the mutton. One inconvenience attending this\r\n    plan, is the necessity of fatting the maiden ewes as well as the\r\n    wethers; they may however be disposed of as fat lambs, or the\r\n    practice of spaying might be adopted, so as to increase the\r\n    fatting disposition of the animal. Crossing, therefore, should\r\n    be adopted with the greatest caution and skill where the object\r\n    is to improve the breed of animals; it should never be practiced\r\n    carelessly or capriciously, but it may be advantageously pursued\r\n    with a view to raising superior and profitable animals for the\r\n    butcher.\"\r\n\r\nIn another paper on this subject, after presenting many interesting\r\ndetails regarding British breeds of sheep and the results of crossing,\r\nMr. Spooner says:\r\n\r\n    \"We cannot do better, in concluding our paper, than gather up\r\n    and arrange in a collected form, the various points of our\r\n    subject, which appear to be of sufficient importance to be again\r\n    presented to the attention of our readers. We think, therefore,\r\n    we are justified in coming to the conclusions:\r\n\r\n    1st. That there is a direct pecuniary advantage in judicious\r\n    cross-breeding; that increased size, disposition to fatten, and\r\n    early maturity, are thereby induced.\r\n\r\n    2d. That while this may be caused for the most part, by the very\r\n    fact of crossing, yet it is principally due to the superior\r\n    influence of the male over the size and external appearance of\r\n    the offspring; so that it is desirable, for the purpose of the\r\n    butcher, that the male should be of a larger frame than the\r\n    female, and should excel in those peculiarities we are desirous\r\n    of reproducing. Let it be here however, repeated, as an\r\n    exceptional truth, that though as a rule the male parent\r\n    influences mostly the size and external form, and the female\r\n    parent the constitution, general health and vital powers, yet\r\n    that the opposite result sometimes takes place.\r\n\r\n    3d. Certain peculiarities may be imparted to a breed by a single\r\n    cross. Thus, the ponies of the New Forest exhibit\r\n    characteristics of blood, although it is many years since that a\r\n    thorough-bred horse was turned into the forest for the purpose.\r\n    So, likewise, we observe in the Hampshire sheep the Roman nose\r\n    and large heads, which formed so strong a feature in their\r\n    maternal ancestors, although successive crosses of the South\r\n    Down were employed to change the character of the breed. * * *\r\n\r\n    4th. Although in the crossing of sheep for the purpose of the\r\n    butcher, it is generally advisable to use males of a larger\r\n    breed, provided they possess a disposition to fatten; yet, in\r\n    such cases, it is of importance that the _pelvis_ of the female\r\n    should be wide and capacious, so that no injury should arise in\r\n    lambing, in consequence of the increased size of the heads of\r\n    the lambs. The shape of the ram's head should be studied for the\r\n    same reason. In crossing, however, for the purpose of\r\n    establishing a new breed, the size of the male must give way to\r\n    other more important considerations; although it will still be\r\n    desirable to use a large female of the breed which we seek to\r\n    improve. Thus the South Downs have vastly improved the larger\r\n    Hampshires, and the Leicester the huge Lincolns and the\r\n    Cotswolds.\r\n\r\n    5th. Although the benefits are most evident in the first cross,\r\n    after which, from pairing the cross-bred animals, the defects of\r\n    one breed or the other, or the incongruities of both, are\r\n    perpetually breaking out--yet, unless the characteristics and\r\n    conformation of the two breeds are altogether averse to each\r\n    other, nature opposes no barrier to their successful admixture;\r\n    so that in the course of time, by the aid of selection and\r\n    careful weeding, it is practicable to establish a new breed\r\n    altogether. This, in fact, has been the history of our principal\r\n    breeds. * * *\r\n\r\n    We confess that we cannot entirely admit either of the\r\n    antagonistic doctrines held by the rival advocates of crossing\r\n    and pure breeding. The public have reason to be grateful to the\r\n    exertions of either party; and still more have they respectively\r\n    reason to be grateful to each other. * * * *\r\n\r\n    Let us conclude by repeating the advice that, when equal\r\n    advantages can be attained by keeping a pure breed of sheep,\r\n    such pure breed should unquestionably be preferred; and that,\r\n    although crossing for the purpose of the butcher may be\r\n    practiced with impunity, and even with advantage, yet no one\r\n    should do so for the purpose of establishing a new breed, unless\r\n    he has clear and well defined views of the object he seeks to\r\n    accomplish, and has duly studied the principles on which it can\r\n    be carried out, and is determined to bestow for the space of\r\n    half a life-time his constant and unremitting attention to the\r\n    discovery and removal of defects.\"\r\n\r\nThe term crossing is sometimes used in a much more restricted sense,\r\nas in the remark of Mr. Boswell in his essay quoted on page 69 where\r\nhe says, \"When I praise the advantage of crossing I would have it\r\nclearly understood that it is only to bring together animals _not\r\nnearly related_ but always of _the same breed_.\" It is evident that\r\nsuch crossing as this is wholly unobjectionable; no one but an avowed\r\nand ultra advocate of close breeding could possibly find any fault\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another style of crossing which when practicable, may, it\r\nis believed, be made a means to the highest degree of improvement\r\nattainable, and especially in the breeding of horses. The word \"breed\"\r\nis often used with varying signification. In order to be understood,\r\nlet me premise that I use it here simply to designate a class of\r\nanimals possessing a good degree of uniformity growing out of the fact\r\nof a common origin and of their having been reared under similar\r\nconditions. The method proposed is to unite animals _possessing\r\nsimilarity of desirable characteristics, with difference of breed_;\r\nthat is to say, difference of breed in the sense just specified. From\r\nunions based upon this principle, the selections being guided by a\r\nskillful judgment and a discriminating tact, we may expect progeny\r\npossessing not only a fitting and symmetrical development of the\r\nlocomotive system, but also an amount and intensity of nervous energy\r\nand power unattainable by any other method.\r\n\r\nSuch was in all probability the origin of the celebrated horse Justin\r\nMorgan; an animal which not only did more to stamp excellence and\r\nimpart value to the roadsters of New England than any other, but was\r\nthe originator of the only distinct, indigenous breed of animals of\r\nwhich America can boast;--a breed which as fast and durable road\r\nhorses and for any light harness work, is not equalled by any other,\r\nany where. In the present state of our knowledge it is scarcely\r\nconceivable how an animal possessing the endowments of Justin Morgan\r\ncould have originated in any other way than from such a parentage as\r\nabove indicated. On the other hand it is very certain that _contrast\r\nin character_, as well as in breed, has occasioned much of the\r\ndisappointment of which breeders have had occasion to complain.\r\n\r\nThe principle here laid down is one of broad application, and should\r\nnever be lost sight of in attempts at improvement by crossing. Another\r\npoint worthy special attention is that all crossing, to insure\r\nsuccessful results, should be gentle rather than violent; that is,\r\nnever couple animals possessing marked dissimilarity, but endeavor to\r\nremedy faults and to effect improvement by gradual approaches. Harmony\r\nof structure and a proper balancing of desirable characteristics, \"an\r\nequilibrium of good qualities,\" as it has been happily expressed, can\r\nbe secured only in this way.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place here to say, that much of the talk about\r\n_blood_ in animals, especially horses, is sheer nonsense. When a\r\n\"blood horse\" is spoken of, it means, so far as it means any thing,\r\nthat his pedigree can be traced to Arabian or Barbary origin, and so\r\nis possessed of the peculiar type of structure and great nervous\r\nenergy which usually attaches to \"thorough-bred\" horses. When a bull,\r\nor cow, or sheep is said to be of \"pure blood,\" it means simply that\r\nthe animal is of some distinct variety--that it has been bred from an\r\nancestry all of which were marked by the same peculiarities and\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nSo long as the term \"blood\" is used to convey the idea of definite\r\nhereditary qualities it may not be objectionable. We frequently use\r\nexpressions which are not strictly accurate, as when we speak of the\r\nsun's rising and setting, and so long as every body knows that we\r\nrefer to apparent position and not to any motion of the sun, no false\r\nideas are conveyed. But to suppose that the hereditary qualities of\r\nan animal attach to the blood more than to any other fluid or to any\r\nof the tissues of the body, or that the blood of a high-bred horse is\r\nessentially different from that of another, is entirely erroneous. The\r\nqualities of an animal depend upon its organization and endowments,\r\nand the blood is only the vehicle by which these are nourished and\r\nsustained;--moreover the blood varies in quality, composition and\r\namount, according to the food eaten, the air breathed and the exercise\r\ntaken. If one horse is better than another it is not because the fluid\r\nin his veins is of superior quality, but rather because his structure\r\nis more perfect mechanically, and because nervous energy is present in\r\nfitting amount and intensity.\r\n\r\nFor illustration, take two horses--one so built and endowed that he\r\ncan draw two tons or more, three miles in an hour; the other so that\r\nhe can trot a mile in three minutes or less. Let us suppose the blood\r\ncoursing in the veins of each to be transferred to the other; would\r\nthe draft horse acquire speed thereby, or the trotter acquire power?\r\nJust as much and no more as if you fed each for a month with the hay,\r\noats and water intended for the other.\r\n\r\nIt is well to attend to pedigree, for thus only can we know what are\r\nthe hereditary qualities, but it is not well to lay too much stress\r\nupon \"blood,\" What matters it that my horse was sired by such a one or\r\nsuch a one, if he be himself defective? In breeding horses,\r\n_structure_ is first, and endowment with nervous energy is next to be\r\nseen to, and then pedigree--afterwards that these be fittingly united,\r\nby proper selection for coupling, in order to secure the highest\r\ndegree of probability which the nature of the case admits, that the\r\noffspring may prove a perfect machine and be suitably endowed with\r\nmotive power.\r\n\r\n\"The body of an animal is a piece of mechanism, the moving power of\r\nwhich is the vital principle, which like fire to the steam engine sets\r\nthe whole in motion; but whatever quantity of fire or vital energy may\r\nbe applied, neither the animal machine nor the engine will work with\r\nregularity and effect, unless the individual parts of which the\r\nmachine is composed are properly adjusted and fitted for the purposes\r\nfor which they are intended; or if it is found that the machine does\r\nmove by the increase of moving power, still the motion is irregular\r\nand imperfect; the bolts and joints are continually giving way, there\r\nis a continued straining of the various parts, and the machine becomes\r\nworn out and useless in half the time it might have lasted if the\r\nproportions had been just and accurate. Such is the case with the\r\nanimal machine. It is not enough that it is put in motion by the\r\nnoblest spirit or that it is nourished by the highest blood; every\r\nbone must have its just proportion; every muscle or tendon its proper\r\npulley; every lever its proper length and fulcrum; every joint its\r\nmost accurate adjustment and proper lubrication; all must have their\r\nrelative proportions and strength, before the motions of the machine\r\ncan be accurate, vigorous and durable. In every machine modifications\r\nare required according as the purposes vary to which it is applied.\r\nThe heavy dray horse is far from having the arrangement necessary for\r\nthe purposes of the turf, while the thorough-bred is as ill adapted\r\nfor the dray. Animals are therefore to be selected for the individual\r\npurposes for which they are intended, with the modifications of form\r\nproper for the different uses to which they are to be applied; but for\r\nwhatever purpose they may be intended, there are some points which are\r\ncommon to all, in the adjustment of the individual parts. If the bones\r\nwant their due proportions, or are imperfectly placed--if the muscles\r\nor tendons want their proper levers--if the flexions of the joints be\r\ninterrupted by the defectiveness of their mechanism, the animal must\r\neither be defective in motion or strength; the bones have irregular\r\npressure, and if they do not break, become diseased; if the muscles or\r\ntendons do not become sprained or ruptured, they are defective in\r\ntheir action; if friction or inflammation does not take place in the\r\njoints, the motions are awkward and grotesque. As in every other\r\nmachine, the beauty of the animate, whether in motion or at rest,\r\ndepends upon the arrangement of the individual parts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nBREEDING IN THE LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preferable style of breeding for the great majority of farmers to\r\nadopt, is neither to cross, nor to breed from close affinities,\r\n(except in rare instances and for some specific and clearly understood\r\npurpose,) but to _breed in the line_, that is, select the breed or\r\nrace best adapted to fulfill the requirements demanded, whether it be\r\nfor the dairy, for labor or for beef in cattle, or for such\r\ncombination of these as can be had without too great sacrifice of the\r\nprincipal requisite; whether for fine wool as a primary object and for\r\nmeat as a secondary one, or for mutton as a primary and wool for a\r\nsecondary object, and then procure a _pure bred_ male of the kind\r\ndetermined on, and breed him to the females of the herd or of the\r\nflock; and if these be not such as are calculated to develop his\r\nqualities, endeavor by purchase or exchange to procure such as will.\r\nLet the progeny of these be bred to another _pure bred_ male of the\r\nsame breed, but as distantly related to the first as may be. Let this\r\nplan be steadily pursued, and although we cannot, without the\r\nintervention of well bred females, obtain stock purely of kind\r\ndesired, yet in several generations, if proper care be given in the\r\nselection of males, that each one be such as to retain and improve\r\nupon the points gained by his predecessor, the stock for most\r\npractical purposes will be as good as if thorough-bred. Were this plan\r\ngenerally adopted, and a system of letting or exchange of males\r\nestablished, the cost might be brought within the means of most\r\npersons, and the advantages which would accrue would be almost beyond\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nThe writer on Cattle in the Library of Useful Knowledge well\r\nremarks:--\"At the outset of his career, the farmer should have a clear\r\nand determined conception of the object that he wishes to accomplish.\r\nHe should consider the nature of his farm; the quality, abundance or\r\ndeficiency of his pasturage, the character of the soil, the seasons of\r\nthe year when he will have plenty or deficiency of food, the locality\r\nof his farm, the market to which he has access and the produce which\r\ncan be disposed of with greatest profit, and these things will at once\r\npoint to him the breed he should be solicitous to obtain. The man of\r\nwealth and patriotism may have more extensive views, and nobly look to\r\nthe general improvement of cattle; but the farmer, with his limited\r\nmeans and with the claims that press upon him, regards his cattle as a\r\nvaluable portion of his own little property, and on which every thing\r\nshould appear to be in natural keeping, and be turned to the best\r\nadvantage. The best beast for him is that which suits his farm the\r\nbest, and with a view to this, he studies, or ought to study, the\r\npoints and qualities of his own cattle, and those of others. The\r\ndairyman will regard the quantity of milk--the quality--its value for\r\nthe production of butter and cheese--the time that the cow continues\r\nin milk--the character of the breed for quietness, or as being good\r\nnurses--the predisposition to garget or other disease, or dropping\r\nafter calving--the natural tendency to turn every thing to\r\nnutriment--the ease with which she is fattened when given up as a\r\nmilker, and the proportion of food requisite to keep her in full milk\r\nor to fatten her when dry. The grazier will consider the kind of beast\r\nwhich his land will bear--the kind of meat most in demand in his\r\nneighborhood--the early maturity--the quickness of fattening at any\r\nage--the quality of the meat--the parts on which the flesh and fat are\r\nprincipally laid--and more than all the hardihood and the adaptation\r\nto the climate and soil.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain these valuable properties the good farmer will make\r\nhimself perfectly master of the characters and qualities of his own\r\nstock. He will trace the connection of certain good qualities and\r\ncertain bad ones, with an almost invariable peculiarity of shape and\r\nstructure; and at length he will arrive at a clear conception, not so\r\nmuch of beauty of form (although that is a pleasing object to\r\ncontemplate) as of that outline and proportion of parts with which\r\n_utility_ is oftenest combined. Then carefully viewing his stock he\r\nwill consider where they approach to, and how far they wander from,\r\nthis utility of form; and he will be anxious to preserve or to\r\nincrease the one and to supply the deficiency of the other. He will\r\nendeavor to select from his own stock those animals that excel in the\r\nmost valuable points, and particularly those which possess the\r\ngreatest number of these points, and he will unhesitatingly condemn\r\nevery beast that manifests deficiency in any one important point. He\r\nwill not, however, too long confine himself to his own stock, unless\r\nit be a very numerous one. The breeding from close affinities has many\r\nadvantages to a certain extent. It was the source whence sprung the\r\ncattle and sheep of Bakewell and the superior cattle of Colling; and\r\nto it must also be traced the speedy degeneracy, the absolute\r\ndisappearance of the New Leicester cattle, and, in the hands of many\r\nagriculturists, the impairment of constitution and decreased value of\r\nthe New Leicester sheep and of the Short-horns. He will therefore seek\r\nsome change in his stock every second or third year, and that change\r\nis most conveniently effected by introducing a new bull. This bull\r\nshould be of the same breed, and pure, coming from a similar pasturage\r\nand climate, but possessing no relationship--or, at most, a very\r\ndistant one--to the stock to which he is introduced. He should bring\r\nwith him every good point which the breeder has labored to produce in\r\nhis stock, and if possible, some improvement, and especially in the\r\npoints where the old stock may have been somewhat deficient, and most\r\ncertainly he should have no manifest defect of form; and that most\r\nessential of all qualifications, a hardy constitution, should not be\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance, however, which the breeder occasionally\r\nforgets, but which is of as much importance to the permanent value of\r\nhis stock as any careful selection of animals can be--and that is,\r\ngood keeping. It has been well said that all good stock must be both\r\nbred with attention and well fed. It is necessary that these two\r\nessentials in this species of improvement should always accompany each\r\nother; for without good resources of keeping, it would be vain to\r\nattempt supporting a valuable stock. This is true with regard to the\r\noriginal stock. It is yet more evident when animals are absurdly\r\nbrought from a better to a poorer soil. The original stock will\r\ndeteriorate if neglected and half-starved, and the improved breed will\r\nlose ground even more rapidly, and to a far greater extent.\"\r\n\r\nA very brief resumé of the preceding remarks may be expressed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe Law of Similarity teaches us to select animals for breeding which\r\npossess the desired forms and qualities in the greatest perfection and\r\nbest combination.\r\n\r\nRegard should be had not only to the more obvious characteristics, but\r\nalso to such hereditary traits and tendencies as may be hidden from\r\ncursory observation and demand careful and thorough investigation.\r\n\r\nFrom the hereditary nature of all characteristics, whether good or\r\nbad, we learn the importance of having all desirable qualities and\r\nproperties _thoroughly inbred_; or, in other words, so firmly fixed in\r\neach generation, that the next is warrantably certain to present\r\nnothing worse,--that no ill results follow from breeding back towards\r\nsome inferior ancestor,--that all undesirable traits or points be, so\r\nfar as possible, _bred out_.\r\n\r\nSo important is this consideration, that in practice, it is decidedly\r\npreferable to employ a male of ordinary external appearance, provided\r\nhis ancestry be all which is desired, rather than a grade or\r\ncross-bred animal, although the latter be greatly his superior in\r\npersonal beauty.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the Law of Divergence teaches us to avoid, for breeding\r\npurposes, such animals as exhibit variations unfavorable to the\r\npurpose in view; and to endeavor to perpetuate every real improvement\r\ngained; also to secure as far as practicable, the conditions\r\nnecessary to induce or to perpetuate any improvement, such as general\r\ntreatment, food, climate, habit, &c.\r\n\r\nWhere the parents do not possess the perfection desired, selections\r\nfor coupling should be made with critical reference to correcting the\r\nfaults or deficiencies of one by corresponding excellence in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBut to correct defects too much must not be attempted at once. Pairing\r\nthose very unlike, oftener results in loss than in gain. Mating a\r\nhorse for speed with a draft mare, will more likely beget progeny good\r\nfor neither, than for both. Avoid all extremes, and endeavor by\r\nmoderate degrees to obtain the object desired.\r\n\r\nCrossing, between different breeds, for the purpose of obtaining\r\nanimals for the shambles, may be advantageously practiced to\r\nconsiderable extent, but not for the production of breeding animals.\r\nAs a general rule cross-bred males should not be employed for\r\npropagation, and cross-bred females should be served by thorough-bred\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary practice, breeding from near relationships is to be\r\n_scrupulously avoided_; for certain purposes, under certain conditions\r\nand circumstances, and in the hands of a skillful breeder, it may be\r\npracticed with advantage, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn a large majority of cases (other things being equal) we may expect\r\nin progeny the outward form and general structure of the sire,\r\ntogether with the internal qualities, constitution and nutritive\r\nsystem of the dam; each, however, modified by the other.\r\n\r\nParticular care should always be taken that the male by which the dam\r\nfirst becomes pregnant is the best which can be obtained; also, that\r\nat the time of sexual congress both are in vigorous health.\r\n\r\nBreeding animals should not be allowed to become fat, but always kept\r\nin thrifty condition; and such as are intended for the butcher should\r\nnever be fat but once.\r\n\r\nIn deciding with what breeds to stock a farm, endeavor to select those\r\nbest adapted to its surface, climate, and degree of fertility; also\r\nwith reference to probable demand and proximity to markets.\r\n\r\nNo expense incurred in procuring choice animals for propagation, or\r\nany amount of skill in breeding, can supersede, or compensate for, a\r\nlack of liberal feeding and good treatment. The better the stock, the\r\nbetter care they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF VARIOUS BREEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is frequently made, what is the best breed of cattle,\r\nsheep, &c., for general use. In reply it may be said that no breed can\r\nby any possibility fulfill all requirements in the best possible\r\nmanner; one is better for meat and early maturity, another for milk,\r\nanother for wool, and so on. Because under certain circumstances it\r\nmay be necessary or advisable for a man to serve as his own builder,\r\ntailor, tanner and blacksmith, it by no means follows that all which\r\nis required will be as well, or as easily done, as by a division of\r\nlabor. So it is better for many reasons, and more profit can be made,\r\nby employing different breeds for different purposes, than by using\r\none for all, and towards such profitable employment we should\r\nconstantly aim. At the same time there is a large class of farmers so\r\nsituated that they cannot keep distinct breeds, and yet wish to employ\r\nthem for different uses, and whose requirements will best be met by a\r\nkind of cattle, which, without possessing remarkable excellence in any\r\none direction, shall be sufficiently hardy, the oxen proving docile\r\nand efficient laborers for a while, and then turn quickly into good\r\nbeef upon such food as their farms will produce, the cows giving a\r\nfair quantity and quality of milk for the needs of the family and\r\nperhaps to furnish a little butter and cheese for market.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to answer the inquiry more definitely, it may be\r\nwell to remark further, that among the facts of experience regarding\r\ncattle, sheep and horses, nothing is better established than that no\r\nbreed can be transferred from the place where it originated, and to\r\nwhich it was suited, to another of unlike surface, climate and\r\nfertility, and retain equal adaptation to its new situation, nor can\r\nit continue to be what it was before. It must and will vary. The\r\ninfluence of climate alone, aside from food and other agencies in\r\ncausing variation, is so great that the utmost skill in breeding, and\r\ncare in all other respects, cannot wholly control its modifying\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIt is also pretty well established that no breed brought in from\r\nabroad can be fully as good, _other things being equal_, as one\r\nindigenous to the locality, or what approximates the same thing, as\r\none, which by being reared through repeated generations on the spot\r\nhas become thoroughly acclimated; so that the presumption is strongly\r\nin favor of _natives_.\r\n\r\nWhen we look about us however, we find, if we except the Morgan\r\nhorses, nothing which deserves the name of indigenous breeds or races.\r\nThe cattle and sheep known as \"natives\" are of mixed foreign origin,\r\nand have been bred with no care in selection, but crossed in every\r\npossible way. They possess no fixed hereditary traits, and although\r\namong them are many of very respectable qualities, and which possess\r\ndesirable characteristics, they cannot be relied upon _as breeders, to\r\nproduce progeny of like excellence_. Instead of constancy, there is\r\ncontinual variation, and frequent \"breeding back,\" exhibiting the\r\nundesirable traits of inferior ancestors. That a breed might be\r\nestablished from them, by careful selection continued during repeated\r\ngenerations, aided perhaps by judicious crossing with more recent\r\nimportations, fully as good as any now existing, is not to be doubted.\r\nVery probably, a breed for dairy purposes might be thus created which\r\nshould excel any now existing in Europe, for some of our so called\r\nnative cows, carelessly as they have been bred, are not surpassed by\r\nany of foreign origin upon which great care has been expended. To\r\naccomplish this is an object worthy the ambition of those who possess\r\nthe skill, enthusiasm, ample means and indomitable perseverance\r\nrequisite to success. But except the single attempt of Col. Jaques, of\r\nthe Ten Hills Farm, to establish the Creampot breed,[24] of which, as\r\nlittle has been heard since his death, it is fair to presume that it\r\nhas dropped into the level of common grade cattle, no systematic and\r\ncontinued effort has come to our knowledge. Consequently such as may\r\nbe deemed absolutely the best is a thing of the future; they do not\r\nyet exist--and there is no probability that the desideratum will soon\r\nbe attained. We Yankees are an impatient people; we dislike to wait,\r\nfor any thing, or to invest where five, ten, twenty or fifty years may\r\nbe expected to elapse before satisfactory dividends may be safely\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nStill, if all would begin to-day, to use what skill and judgment they\r\nhave, or can acquire, in breeding only from the best of such as they\r\nhave, coupling with reference to their peculiarities, and consigning\r\nto the butcher as fast as possible every inferior animal, and if, in\r\naddition, they would do what is equally necessary, namely, improve\r\ntheir general treatment as much as lies in their power, there would\r\nresult an immediate, a marked and a steadily progressive improvement\r\nin stock. To the acclimation or Americanization already acquired,\r\nwould be added increased symmetry of form and greater value in many\r\nother respects. This is within the power of every man, and whatever\r\nelse he may be obliged to leave undone, for want of ability, none\r\nshould be content to fall short of this. Those who have the command of\r\nample means will of course desire that improvement should be as rapid\r\nas possible. They will endeavor at once to procure well bred animals,\r\nor in other words, such as already possess the desired qualities so\r\nthoroughly inwrought into their organization that they can rely with a\r\ngood degree of confidence on their imparting them to their progeny.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to allude here to a distinction between breeds and\r\nraces. By _breeds_, are understood such varieties as were originally\r\nproduced by a cross or mixture, like the Leicester sheep for example,\r\nand subsequently established by selecting for breeding purposes only\r\nthe best specimens and rejecting all others. In process of time\r\ndeviations become less frequent and greater uniformity is secured; but\r\nthere remains a tendency, greater or less in proportion to the time\r\nwhich elapses and the skill employed in selection, to resolve itself\r\ninto its original elements, to breed back toward one or other of the\r\nkinds of which it was at first composed.\r\n\r\nBy _races_, are understood such varieties as were moulded to their\r\npeculiar type by natural causes, with no interference of man, no\r\nintermixture of other varieties, and have continued substantially the\r\nsame for a period beyond which the memory and knowledge of man does\r\nnot reach. Such are the North Devon cattle, and it is fortunate that\r\nattention was drawn to the merits of this variety before facilities\r\nfor inter-communication had so greatly increased as of late, and while\r\nyet the race in some districts remained pure. All that breeders have\r\ndone to better it, is by selections and rejections from within itself;\r\nand so, much improvement has been effected without any adulteration.\r\nConsequently we may anticipate that so long as no crossing takes\r\nplace, there will be little variation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the established breeds of cattle the IMPROVED SHORT-HORNS are\r\nthe most fashionable, and the most widely diffused; and where the\r\nfertility of the soil, and the climate, are such as to allow the\r\ndevelopment of their peculiar excellencies, they occupy the highest\r\nrank as a meat-producing breed. Their beef is hardly equal in quality\r\nto that of the Devons, Herefords or Scots, the fat and lean being not\r\nso well mixed together and the flesh of coarser grain. But they\r\npossess a remarkable tendency to lay on fat and flesh, attaining\r\ngreater size and weight, and coming earlier to maturity than any other\r\nbreed. These properties, together with their symmetry and stately\r\nbeauty, make them very popular in those counties of England, where\r\nthey originated, and wherever else they have been carried, provided\r\ntheir surroundings are such as to meet their wants. In the rich\r\npastures of Kentucky and in some other parts of the west, they seem as\r\nmuch at home as on the banks of the Tees, and are highly and\r\ndeservedly esteemed. The Short-horns have also been widely and\r\nsuccessfully used to cross with most other breeds, and with inferior\r\nmixed cattle, as they are found to impress strongly upon them their\r\nown characteristics.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into the question of its original composition, or of\r\nits antiquity, regarding both of which much doubt exists, it may\r\nsuffice here to say, that about a hundred years ago, Charles Colling\r\nand others entered zealously and successfully into an attempt to\r\nimprove them by careful breeding, in whose hands they soon acquired a\r\nwide spread fame and brought enormous prices; and the sums realized\r\nfor choice specimens of this breed from that time to the present, have\r\nbeen greater than for those of any other. Much of their early\r\nnotoriety was due to the exhibition of an ox reared by Charles Colling\r\nfrom a common cow by his famous bull \"Favorite,\" and known as the\r\n\"Durham\" ox, and also as the \"Ketton\" ox, (both which names have since\r\nthen been more or less applied to the breed, but which are now mostly\r\nsuperceded by the original and more appropriate one of Short-horn,)\r\nwhich was shown in most parts of England and Scotland from 1801 to\r\n1807, and whose live weight was nearly four thousand pounds, and which\r\nwas at one time valued for purposes of exhibition as high as $10,000.\r\n\r\nThe old Teeswater cattle were remarkably deep milkers, and although it\r\ndoes not appear that good grazing points necessarily conflict with\r\nexcellence for the dairy, the fact is, that as improvement in feeding\r\nqualities was gained, the production of milk in most cases fell off;\r\nand although some families at the present time embrace many excellent\r\nmilkers, the majority of them have deteriorated in this respect about\r\nin proportion to the improvement effected as meat-producing animals.\r\nThe earlier Short-horns introduced into this country were from the\r\nvery best milking families, and their descendants have usually proved\r\nvaluable for dairy purposes--but many of those more recently imported\r\nare unlike them in this respect. By crossing the males upon the common\r\ncows of the country the progeny inherited increased size and symmetry\r\nof form, more quiet dispositions, greater aptitude to feed and earlier\r\nmaturity. Notwithstanding the prejudices with which they were at first\r\nreceived, they gradually rose in estimation, more of them have been\r\nintroduced than of any other breed, and probably more of the\r\nimprovement which has taken place in cattle for the last forty years\r\nis due to them than to any other; yet _as a pure breed they are not\r\nadapted to New England wants_. Their size is beyond the ability of\r\nmost farms to support profitably: crossed upon such as through neglect\r\nin breeding, scanty fare and exposure were bad feeders, too small in\r\nsize, and too slow in growth, they effected great improvement in all\r\nthese respects; and this improvement demanded and encouraged the\r\nbestowal of more food and better treatment, and so they\r\nprospered;--inheriting their constitutions chiefly from the hardy and\r\nacclimated dams, the grades were by no means so delicate and sensitive\r\nas the pure bred animals to the cold and changes of a climate very\r\nunlike that of the mild and fertile region where they originated.\r\n\r\nThe lethargic temperament characteristic of the Short-horn and which\r\nin the grades results in the greater quietness and docility so highly\r\nvalued, necessarily unfits them for active work; pure bred animals\r\nbeing altogether too sluggish for profitable labor. This temperament\r\nis inseparably connected with their aptitude to fatten and early\r\nmaturity, and these both demand abundant and nutritious food beyond\r\nthe ability of many to supply and at the same time are incompatible\r\nwith the activity of habit and hard service demanded of the working\r\nox.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NORTH DEVONS are deemed to be of longer standing than any other of\r\nthe distinct breeds of England, and they have been esteemed for their\r\ngood qualities for several centuries. Mr. George Turner, a noted\r\nbreeder of Devons, describes them as follows:--\"Their color is\r\ngenerally a bright red, but varying a little either darker or more\r\nyellow; they have seldom any white except about the udder of the cow\r\nor belly of the bull, and this is but little seen. They have long\r\nyellowish horns, beautifully and gracefully curved, noses or muzzles\r\nwhite, with expanded nostrils, eyes full and prominent, but calm, ears\r\nof moderate size and yellowish inside, necks rather long, with but\r\nlittle dewlap, and the head well set on, shoulders oblique with small\r\npoints or marrow bones, legs small and straight and feet in\r\nproportion. The chest is of moderate width, and the ribs round and\r\nwell expanded, except in some instances, where too great attention has\r\nbeen paid to the hind quarters at the expense of the fore, and which\r\nhas caused a falling off, or flatness, behind the shoulders. The loins\r\nare first rate, wide, long and full of flesh, hips round and of\r\nmoderate width; rumps level and well filled at the bed; tail full near\r\nthe rump and tapering much at the top. The thighs of the cows are\r\noccasionally light, but the bull and ox are full of muscle, with a\r\ndeep and rich flank. On the whole there is scarcely any breed of\r\ncattle so rich and mellow in its touch, so silky and fine in its hair,\r\nand altogether so handsome in its appearance, as the North Devon,\r\nadded to which they have a greater proportion of weight in the most\r\nvaluable joints and less in the coarse, than any other breed, and also\r\nconsume less food in its production.\r\n\r\nAs milkers they are about the same as most other breeds;--the general\r\naverage of a dairy of cows being about one pound of butter per day\r\nfrom each cow during the summer months, although in some instances the\r\nvery best bred cows give a great deal more.\r\n\r\nAs working oxen they greatly surpass any other breed. They are\r\nperfectly docile and excellent walkers, are generally worked until\r\nfive or six years old, and then fattened at less expense than most\r\nother oxen.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of the report on the live stock shown at the exhibition of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society at Warwick in 1859 (Mr. Robert Smith)\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Although little has been written on it, the improvement of the Devon\r\nhas not been neglected; on the contrary, its breeding has been studied\r\nlike a science, and carried into execution with the most sedulous\r\nattention and dexterity for upwards of two hundred years. The object\r\nof the Devon breeder has been to lessen those parts of the animal\r\nframe which are least useful to man, such as the bone and offal, and\r\nat the same time to increase such other parts (flesh and fat) as\r\nfurnish man with food. These ends have been accomplished by a\r\njudicious selection of individual animals possessing the wished for\r\nform and qualities in the highest degree, which being perpetuated in\r\ntheir progeny in various proportions, and the selection being\r\ncontinued from the most approved specimens among these, enabled the\r\nlate Mr. Francis Quartly at length to fully establish the breed with\r\nthe desired properties. This result is substantially confirmed by the\r\nstatistics contained in Davy's 'Devon Herd-Book.' We have been curious\r\nenough to examine these pedigrees, and find that nine-tenths of the\r\npresent herds of these truly beautiful animals are directly descended\r\n(especially in their early parentage) from the old Quartly stock.\r\nLater improvements have been engrafted on these by the Messrs. Quartly\r\nof the present day. The example of various opulent breeders and\r\nfarmers in all parts of the country has tended to spread this\r\nimprovement, by which the North Devon cattle have become more general\r\nand fashionable. The leading characteristics of the North Devon breed\r\nare such as qualify them for every hardship. They are cast in a\r\npeculiar mold, with a degree of elegance in their movement which is\r\nnot to be excelled. Their hardihood, resulting from compactness of\r\nframe and lightness of offal, enables them (when wanted) to perform\r\nthe operations of the farm with a lively step and great endurance. For\r\nthe production of animal food they are not to be surpassed, and in\r\nconjunction with the Highland Scot of similar pretension, they are the\r\nfirst to receive the attention of the London West-end butcher. In the\r\nshow-yard, again, the form of the Devon and its rich quality of flesh\r\nserve as the leading guide to all decisions. He has a prominent eye,\r\nwith a placid face, small nose and elegantly turned horns, which have\r\nan upward tendency (and cast outward at the end) as if to put the last\r\nfinish upon his symmetrical form and carriage. These animals are\r\nbeautifully covered with silken coats of a medium red color. The\r\nshoulder points, sides, and foreflanks are well covered with rich\r\nmeat, which, when blended with their peculiar property of producing\r\nmeat of first-rate quality along their tops, makes them what they\r\nare--'models of perfection.' Of course, we here speak of the best-bred\r\nanimals. Some object to the North Devon, and class him as a small\r\nanimal, with the remark, 'He is too small for the grazier.' In saying\r\nthis it should ever be remembered that the Devon has its particular\r\nmission to perform, viz., that of converting the produce of cold and\r\nhilly pastures into meat, which could not be done to advantage by\r\nlarge-framed animals, however good their parentage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Devons have been less extensively, and more recently, introduced\r\nthan the Short-horn, but the experience of those who have fairly tried\r\nthem fully sustains the opinions given above, and they promise to\r\nbecome a favorite and prevailing breed. The usual objection made to\r\nthem by those who have been accustomed to consider improvement in\r\ncattle to be necessarily connected with enlargement of size, is, that\r\nthey are too small. But their size instead of being a valid objection,\r\nis believed to be a recommendation, the Devons being as large as the\r\nfertility of New England soils generally are _capable of feeding fully\r\nand profitably_.\r\n\r\nTheir qualities as working oxen are unrivalled, no other breed so\r\nuniformly furnishing such active, docile, strong and hardy workers as\r\nthe Devons, and their uniformity is such as to render it very easy to\r\nmatch them. Without possessing so early maturity as the Short-horns,\r\nthey fatten readily and easily at from four to six years old, and from\r\ntheir compact build and well balanced proportions usually weigh more\r\nthan one accustomed to common cattle would anticipate.\r\n\r\nThe Devons are not generally deep milkers but the milk is richer than\r\nthat of most other breeds, and some families, where proper care and\r\nattention have been given to this quality in breeding, yield largely.\r\nIt is, however, as a breed for general use, combining beef, labor and\r\nmilk, in fair proportion, that the Devons will generally give best\r\nsatisfaction, as they are hardy enough to suit the climate, and\r\ncheaply furnish efficient labor and valuable meat.\r\n\r\nFarmers, whose ideas upon stock have been formed wholly from their\r\nexperience with Short-horns and their grades, have often been\r\nsurprised at witnessing the facility with which Devons sustain\r\nthemselves upon scanty pasturage, and not a few when first critically\r\nexamining well bred specimens, sympathize with the feeling which\r\nprompted the remark made to the reporter of the great English\r\nExhibition at Chester, after examining with him fine specimens of the\r\nDevons--\"I am delighted; I find we Short-horn men have yet much to\r\nlearn of the true formation of animals; their beautiful contour and\r\nextreme quality of flesh surprise me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe HEREFORDS are an ancient and well established breed, and are\r\nprobably entitled to be called a race. Little is known with certainty\r\nof their origin beyond the fact that for many generations they can be\r\ntraced as the peculiar breed of the county whence they derive their\r\nname. Youatt says that \"Mr. Culley, although an excellent judge of\r\ncattle, formed a very erroneous opinion of the Herefords when he\r\npronounced them to be nothing but a mixture of the Welsh with a\r\nbastard race of Long Horns. They are evidently an aboriginal breed,\r\nand descended from the same stock as the Devon. If it were not for the\r\nwhite face and somewhat larger head and thicker neck it would not at\r\nall times be easy to distinguish between a heavy Devon and a light\r\nHereford.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gisborne says \"The Hereford brings good evidence that he is the\r\nBritish representative of a widely diffused and ancient race. The most\r\nuniform drove of oxen which we ever saw, consisted of five hundred\r\nfrom the Ukraine. They had white faces, upward horns and tawny bodies.\r\nPlaced in Hereford, Leicester or Northampton markets, they would have\r\npuzzled the graziers as to the land of their nativity; but no one\r\nwould have hesitated to pronounce that they were rough Herefords.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rowlandson, in his prize report on the farming of Herefordshire,\r\nsays \"The Herefords, or as they have sometimes been termed, the middle\r\nhorned cattle have ever been esteemed a most valuable breed, and when\r\nhoused from the inclemency of the weather, probably put on more meat\r\nand fat in proportion to the food consumed, than any other variety.\r\nThey are not so hardy as the North Devon cattle, to which they bear a\r\ngeneral resemblance; they however are larger than the Devons,\r\nespecially the males. On the other hand, the Herefords are larger\r\nboned, to compensate for which defect, may be cast in the opposite\r\nscale the fact that the flesh of the Hereford ox surpasses all other\r\nbreeds for that beautiful marbled appearance caused by the\r\nintermixture of fat and lean which is so much prized by the epicure.\r\nThe Hereford is usually deeper in the chine, and the shoulders are\r\nlarger and coarser than the Devon. They are worse milkers than the\r\nDevon, or than, perhaps, any other breed, for the Hereford grazier has\r\nneglected the female and paid the whole of his attention to the male.\"\r\nIt is said that formerly they were of a brown or reddish brown color,\r\nand some had grey or mottled faces. Mr. P. Tully states that the white\r\nface originated accidentally on a farm belonging to one of his\r\nancestors. \"That about the middle of the last century the cow-man came\r\nto the house announcing as a remarkable fact that the favorite cow had\r\nproduced a white faced bull calf. This had never been known to have\r\noccurred before, and, as a curiosity it was agreed that the animal\r\nshould be kept and reared as a future sire. Such, in a few words, is\r\nthe origin of a fact that has since prevailed through the country, for\r\nthe progeny of this very bull became celebrated for white faces.\" Of\r\nlate years there has been much uniformity of color; the face, throat,\r\nthe under portion of the body, the inside and lower part of the leg's\r\nand the tip of the tail being white, and the other parts of the body a\r\nrich deep red.\r\n\r\nCompared with the Short-horn the Hereford is nearly as large, of\r\nrather less early maturity, but a better animal for grazing, and\r\nhardier. The competition between these breeds in England is very close\r\nand warm, and taking many facts together it would seem probable that\r\nthe Hereford is in some instances rather more profitable, and the\r\nShort-horn generally more fashionable. Challenges have been repeatedly\r\noffered by Hereford men to Shorthorn men to feed an equal number of\r\neach in order to test their respective merits, and have usually been\r\ndeclined, perhaps because if the decision was against them, the loss\r\nmight be serious, and if they won, the gain would be little or\r\nnothing, the Short-horns being more popular already and commanding\r\nhigher prices.\r\n\r\nAs working oxen the Herefords are preferable to the Short-horns, being\r\nmore hardy and active. Some complaint is made of their being\r\n\"breachy.\" Their large frames demand food, and if enough be furnished\r\nthey are content, but if not, they have intelligence and activity\r\nenough to help themselves if food be within reach. Their chief merit\r\nis as large oxen, for heavy labor, and for beef. Some grade cows from\r\ngood milking dams give a fair quantity of milk, and what they give is\r\nalways rich, but wherever they have been introduced, milking qualities\r\ngenerally deteriorate very much.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe AYRSHIRES are a breed especially valuable for dairy purposes.\r\nRegarding its origin, Mr. Aiton who felt much interest in the subject,\r\nand whose opportunities for knowing the facts were second to those of\r\nno other, writing about forty years since, says, \"The dairy breed of\r\ncows in the county of Ayr now so much and so deservedly esteemed, is\r\nnot, in their present form, an ancient or indigenous race, but a breed\r\nformed during the memory of living individuals and which have been\r\ngradually improving for more than fifty years past, till now they are\r\nbrought to a degree of perfection that has never been surpassed as\r\ndairy stock in any part of Britain, or probably in the world. They\r\nhave increased to double their former size, and they yield about four\r\nand some of them five times as much milk as formerly. By greater\r\nattention to breeding and feeding, they have been changed from an\r\nill-shaped, puny, mongrel race of cattle to a fixed and specific breed\r\nof excellent color and quality. So gradually and imperceptibly were\r\nimprovements in the breed and condition of the cattle introduced,\r\nthat although I lived in Ayrshire from 1760 to 1785, and have\r\ntraversed it every year since, I have difficulty in stating from my\r\nown observation or what I have learned from others, either the precise\r\nperiod when improvement began, or the exact means by which a change so\r\nimportant was wrought.\" He then relates several instances in which\r\nbetween 1760 and 1770 some larger cows were brought in of the English\r\nor Dutch breeds, and of their effect he says, \"I am disposed to\r\nbelieve that although they rendered the red color with white patches\r\nfashionable in Ayr, they could not have had much effect in changing\r\nthe breed into their present highly improved condition,\" and thinks it\r\nmainly due to careful selections and better treatment.\r\n\r\nMr. Aiton says \"the chief qualities of a dairy cow are that she gives\r\na copious draught of milk, that she fattens readily and turns out well\r\nin the shambles. In all these respects combined the Ayrshire breed\r\nexcels all others in Scotland, and is probably superior to any in\r\nBritain. They certainly yield more milk than any other breed in\r\nEurope. No other breed fatten faster, and none cut up better in the\r\nshambles, and the fat is as well mixed with the lean flesh, or\r\nmarbled, as the butchers say, as any other. They always turn out\r\nbetter than the most skillful grazier or butcher who are strangers to\r\nthe breed could expect on handling them. They are tame, quiet, and\r\nfeed at ease without roaming, breaking over fences, or goring each\r\nother. They are very hardy and active, and are not injured but rather\r\nimproved by lying out all night during summer and autumn.\"\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Aiton wrote, even greater care and attention has been paid\r\nto this breed than before, and it is now well entitled to rank as the\r\nfirst dairy breed in the world, quantity and quality of yield and the\r\namount of food required being all considered. Compared with the\r\nJersey, its only rival as a dairy breed, the milk of the Ayrshire is\r\nmuch more abundant, and richer in caseine, but not so rich in oily\r\nmatter, although better in this respect than the average of cows.\r\n\r\nExperience of their qualities in this country shows that if they do\r\nnot here fully sustain their reputation in Scotland, they come near to\r\nit, as near as the difference in our drier climate allows, giving more\r\ngood milk upon a given amount of food than any other. Upon ordinarily\r\nfertile pastures they yield largely and prove very hardy and docile.\r\nThe oxen too are good workers, fatten well, and yield juicy, fine\r\nflavored meat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe JERSEY race, formerly known as the Aldernay, is almost exclusively\r\nemployed for dairy purposes, and may not be expected to give\r\nsatisfaction for other uses. Their milk is richer than that of any\r\nother cows, and the butter made from it possesses a superior flavor\r\nand a deep rich color, and consequently commands an extraordinary\r\nprice in all markets where good butter is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Jersey cattle are of Norman origin, and until within about twenty\r\nor thirty years were far more uninviting in appearance than now, great\r\nimprovement having been effected in their symmetry and general\r\nappearance by means of careful selections in breeding, and this\r\nwithout loss of milking properties. The cows are generally very docile\r\nand gentle, but the males when past two or three years of age often\r\nbecome vicious and unmanageable. It is said that the cows fatten\r\nreadily when dry, and make good beef.\r\n\r\nThere is no branch of cattle husbandry which promises better returns\r\nthan the breeding and rearing of milch cows. Here and there are to be\r\nfound some good enough. In the vicinity of large towns and cities are\r\nmany which having been culled from many miles around, on account of\r\ndairy properties, are considerably above the average, but taking the\r\ncows of the country together they do not compare favorably with the\r\noxen. Farmers generally take more pride in their oxen, and strive to\r\nhave as good or better than any of their neighbors, while if a cow\r\nwill give milk enough to rear a large steer calf and a little besides,\r\nit is often deemed satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP.--The sheep first introduced into this country were of English\r\norigin, and generally not very dissimilar to the ancient unimproved\r\nDown sheep. Probably some were these--as many of the first cattle were\r\nthe Devons of that day. More than fifty years since the Merinos were\r\nintroduced and extensively bred. At various periods other choice\r\nbreeds have been introduced. The number kept has fluctuated very much,\r\ndepending mainly on the market value of wool. When it was high many\r\nkept sheep, and when it fell the flocks were neglected.\r\n\r\nThe true mission of the sheep in fulfilling the threefold purpose of\r\nfurnishing _food, and raiment, and the means of fertilization_, seems\r\nnot yet to be generally apprehended. One of the most serious defects\r\nin the husbandry of New England at the present time, is the prevalent\r\nneglect of sheep. Ten times the present number might be easily fed,\r\nand they would give in meat, wool and progeny, more direct profit than\r\nany other domestic animal, and at the same time the food they consume\r\nwould do more towards fertilizing the farms than an equal amount\r\nconsumed by any other animal.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that our pastures have seriously deteriorated in\r\nfertility and become overrun with worthless weeds and bushes to the\r\nexclusion of nutritious grasses. Sheep husbandry has declined. If\r\nthese two facts as uniformly stand to each other in the relation of\r\ncause and effect, as they certainly do in many instances, the remedy\r\nis suggested at once--replace the animal with \"golden feet.\" After\r\ndevoting the best land to cultivation and the poorest to wood, we have\r\nthousands upon thousands of acres evidently intended by the Creator\r\nfor sheep walks, because better adapted for this purpose than for any\r\nother. An indication of Providence so unmistakable as this should not\r\nbe unheeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MERINOS are perhaps the most ancient race of sheep extant. They\r\noriginated in Spain, and were for ages bred there alone. In 1765 they\r\nwere introduced into Saxony, where they were bred with care and with\r\nspecial reference to increasing the fineness of the wool, little\r\nregard being paid to other considerations. They were also taken to\r\nFrance and to Silesia, and from all these sources importations have\r\nbeen made into the United States. The Spanish Merino has proved the\r\nmost successful, and by skill and care in breeding has been greatly\r\nimproved, insomuch that intelligent judges are of opinion that some of\r\nthe Vermont flocks are superior to the best in Europe, both in form,\r\nhardiness, quantity of fleece and staple. They are too well known to\r\nrequire a detailed description here. Suffice it to say that they are\r\nbelow rather than above medium size, possessing a good constitution,\r\nand are thrifty, and cheaply kept. Their chief merit is as fine wooled\r\nsheep, and as such they excel all others. As mutton sheep they are\r\nconstitutionally and anatomically deficient, being of late maturity\r\nand great longevity, (a recommendation as fine wooled sheep,) having\r\ntoo flat sides, too narrow chests, too little meat in the best parts,\r\nand too great a percentage of offal when slaughtered. Their mutton,\r\nhowever, is of fair quality when mature and well fatted. As nurses\r\nthey are inferior to many other breeds. Many careful, extensive and\r\nprotracted attempts have been made to produce a breed combining the\r\nfleece of the Merino with the carcass of the Leicester or other long\r\nwooled sheep. They have all signally failed. The forms,\r\ncharacteristics and qualities of breeds so unlike seem to be\r\nincompatible with one another. A cross of the Merino buck and\r\nLeicester ewe gives progeny which is of more rapid growth than the\r\nMerino alone, and is hardier than the Leicester. It is a good cross\r\nfor the butchers' use, but not to be perpetuated. Improvement in the\r\nMerino should be sought by skillful selection and pairing the parents\r\nin view of their relative fitness to one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe LEICESTER, or more properly the New Leicester, is the breed which\r\nBakewell established, and is repeatedly referred to in the preceding\r\npages. It has quite superseded the old breed of this name. His aim was\r\nto produce sheep which would give the greatest amount of meat in the\r\nshortest time on a given amount of food, and for early maturity and\r\ndisposition to fatten, it still ranks among the highest. The\r\nobjections to the breed for New England are, that they are not hardy\r\nenough for the climate, and require richer pastures and more abundant\r\nfood than most farmers can supply. Its chief value in such locations\r\nis for crossing upon ordinary sheep for lambs and mutton.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe COTSWOLDS derive their name from a low range of hills in\r\nGloucestershire. These have long been noted for the numbers and\r\nexcellence of the sheep there maintained, and are so called from Cote,\r\na sheepfold, and Would, a naked hill. An old writer says:--\"In these\r\nwoulds they feed in great numbers flocks of sheep, long necked and\r\nsquare of bulk and bone, by reason (as is commonly thought) of the\r\nweally and hilly situation of their pastures, whose wool, being most\r\nfine and soft, is held in passing great account amongst all nations.\"\r\nSince his time, however, great changes have passed both upon the sheep\r\nand the district they inhabit. The improved Cotswolds are among the\r\nlargest British breeds, long wooled, prolific, good nurses, and of\r\nearly maturity. More robust, and less liable to disease than the\r\nLeicesters, of fine symmetry and carrying great weight and light\r\noffal, they are among the most popular of large mutton sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SOUTH DOWN is an ancient British breed, taking its name from a\r\nchalky range of hills in Sussex and other counties in England about\r\nsixty miles in length, known as the South Downs, by the side of which\r\nis a tract of land of ordinary fertility and well calculated for sheep\r\nwalks, and on which probably more than a million of this breed of\r\nsheep are pastured. The flock tended by the \"Shepherd of Salisbury\r\nPlain,\" of whose earnest piety and simple faith Hannah More has told\r\nus in her widely circulated tract, were South Downs. Formerly these\r\nsheep possessed few of the attractions they now present. About the\r\nyear 1782 Mr. John Ellman of Glynde turned his attention to their\r\nimprovement. Unlike his cotemporary Bakewell, he did not attempt to\r\nmake a new breed by crossing, but by attention to the principles of\r\nbreeding, by skillful selections for coupling and continued\r\nperseverance for fifty years, he obtained what he sought--health,\r\nsoundness of constitution, symmetry of form, early maturity, and\r\nfacility of fattening, and thus brought his flock to a high state of\r\nperfection. Before he began we are told that the South Downs were of\r\n\"small size and ill shape, long and thin in the neck, high on the\r\nshoulders, low behind, high on the loins, down on the rumps, the tail\r\nset on very low, sharp on the back, the ribs flat,\" &c., &c., and were\r\nnot mature enough to fatten until three years old or past. Of his\r\nflock in 1794, Arthur Young[25] says: \"Mr. Ellman's flock of sheep, I\r\nmust observe in this place, is unquestionably the first in the\r\ncountry; there is nothing that can be compared with it; the wool is\r\nthe finest and the carcass the best proportioned; although I saw\r\nseveral noble flocks afterwards which I examined with a great degree\r\nof attention; some few had very fine wool, which might be equal to\r\nhis, but then the carcass was ill-shaped, and many had a good carcass\r\nwith coarse wool; but this incomparable farmer had eminently united\r\nboth these circumstances in his flock at Glynde. I affirm this with\r\nthe greater degree of certainty, since the eye of prejudice has been\r\nat work in this country to disparage and call in question the quality\r\nof his flock, merely because he has raised the merit of it by\r\nunremitted attention above the rest of the neighboring farmers, and it\r\nnow stands unrivalled.\" This, it will be noticed, was only twelve\r\nyears after he began his improvements. To Mr. Ellman's credit be it\r\nsaid that he exhibited none of the selfishness which characterized Mr.\r\nBakewell's career, but was always ready to impart information to\r\nthose desirous to learn, and labored zealously to encourage general\r\nimprovement. That he was pecuniarily successful is evident from the\r\ncontinued rise in the price of his sheep. The Duke of Richmond, Mr.\r\nJonas Webb, Mr. Grantham, and other cotemporaries and successors of\r\nMr. Ellman have carried successfully forward the work so well begun by\r\nhim. The Improved South Downs now rank first among British breeds in\r\nhardiness, constitution, early maturity, symmetry, and quality of\r\nmutton and of wool combined. The meat usually brings one to two cents\r\nper pound more than that of most other breeds in Smithfield market. It\r\nis of fine flavor, juicy, and well marbled. The South Downs are of\r\nmedium size, (although Mr. Webb has in some cases attained a live\r\nweight in breeding rams of 250 pounds, and a dressed weight of 200\r\npounds in fattened wethers,) hardy, prolific, and easily kept,\r\nsucceeding on short pastures, although they pay well for liberal\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OXFORD DOWNS may be named as an instance of successful\r\ncross-breeding. They originated in a cross between the Improved\r\nCotswolds and the Hampshire Downs.[26] Having been perpetuated now for\r\nmore than twenty years, they possess so good a degree of uniformity\r\nas to be entitled to the designation of a distinct breed, and have\r\nlately been formally recognized as such in England. They were first\r\nintroduced into Massachusetts by R.S. Fay, Esq., of Lynn, and into\r\nMaine by Mr. Sears, both in 1854. They were first bred with a view to\r\nunite increased size with the superiority of flesh and patience of\r\nshort keep which characterize the Downs. It is understood that they\r\ninherit from the Cotswold a carcass exceeding in weight that of the\r\nDowns from a fifth to a quarter; a fleece somewhat coarser but heavier\r\nthan that of the Downs by one-third to one-half; and from the latter\r\nthey inherit rotundity of form and fullness of muscle in the more\r\nvaluable parts, together with the brown face and leg.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a note of inquiry addressed to Mr. Fay, he says: \"I\r\nselected the Oxford Downs with some hesitation as between them and the\r\nShropshire Downs, after a careful examination of all the various\r\nbreeds of sheep in England. My attention was called to them by\r\nobserving that they took, (1854,) without any distinct name, all the\r\nprizes as mutton sheep at Birmingham and elsewhere, where they were\r\nadmitted to compete. They were only known under the name of half or\r\ncross bred sheep, with name of the breeder. Mr. Rives of Virginia and\r\nmyself went into Oxfordshire to look at them, and so little were they\r\nknown as a class, that Philip Pusey, Esq., President of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society, knew nothing about them, although one of his\r\nlargest tenants, Mr. Druce, had long bred them. It is only within two\r\nyears that they were formally recognized at a meeting, I believe, of\r\nthe Smithfield club, and they then received the name which I gave them\r\nyears ago, of Oxford Downs. By this name they are now known in\r\nEngland. I can only add that an experience of six years confirms all\r\nthat is claimed for them. Fifty-two ewes produced seventy-three\r\nhealthy lambs from February 13th to March 15th, this year. The same\r\newes sheared an average of more than seven pounds to the fleece,\r\nunwashed wool, which sold for 34 cents per pound. A good ram should\r\nweigh as a shearling from 180 to 250 pounds; a good ewe from 125 to\r\n160 pounds. They fatten rapidly, and thrive on rough pasture. My\r\nflock, now the older and poorer ones have been disposed of, will\r\naverage, I have no doubt, eight pounds of wool to the fleece. The\r\nmutton is exceedingly fine and can be turned into cash in 18 months\r\nfrom birth.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe kind of sheep most desirable, on the whole, in any given case,\r\ndepends chiefly on the surface, character and fertility of the farm\r\nand its location. At too great a distance from a good meat market to\r\nallow of a profitable sale of the carcass, the Spanish Merino is\r\ndoubtless to be preferred, but if nearer, the English breeds will pay\r\nbetter. Mutton can be grown cheaper than any other meat. It is daily\r\nbecoming better appreciated, and strange as it may seem, good mutton\r\nbrings a higher price in our best markets than the same quality does\r\nin England. Its substitution in a large measure for pork would\r\ncontribute materially to the health of the community.\r\n\r\nWinter fattening of sheep may often be made very profitable and\r\ndeserves greater attention, especially where manure is an object--(and\r\nwhere is it not?) In England it is considered good policy to fatten\r\nsheep if the increase of weight will pay for the oil cake or grain\r\nconsumed; the manure being deemed a fair equivalent for the other\r\nfood, that is, as much straw and turnips as they will eat. Lean sheep\r\nthere usually command as high a price per pound in the fall as fatted\r\nones in the spring, while here the latter usually bear a much higher\r\nprice, which gives the feeder a great advantage. The difference may be\r\nbest illustrated by a simple calculation. Suppose a wether of a good\r\nmutton breed weighing 80 pounds in the fall to cost 6 cents per pound\r\n($4.80) and to require 20 pounds of hay per week, or its equivalent in\r\nother food, and to gain a pound and a half each week, the gain in\r\nweight in four months would be about 25 pounds, which at 6 cents per\r\npound would be $1.50 or less than $10 per ton for the hay consumed;\r\nbut if the same sheep could be bought in fall for 3 cents per pound\r\nand sold in spring for 6 cents, the gain would amount to $3.90 or\r\nupwards of $20 per ton for the hay--the manure being the same in\r\neither case.\r\n\r\nFor fattening it is well to purchase animals as large and thrifty and\r\nin as good condition as can be done at fair prices; and to feed\r\nliberally so as to secure the most rapid increase which can be had\r\nwithout waste of food.\r\n\r\nThe fattening of sheep by the aid of oil cake or grain purchased for\r\nthe purpose, may often be made a cheaper and altogether preferable\r\nmode of obtaining manure than by the purchase of artificial\r\nfertilizers, as guano, superphosphate of lime, &c. It is practiced\r\nextensively and advantageously abroad and deserves at least a fair\r\ntrial here.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSES.--It does not seem necessary in this connection to give\r\ndescriptions of the various breeds of horses, as comparatively few of\r\nour animals can fairly be said to be of any pure or distinct\r\nvarieties. Names are common enough, but the great majority of the\r\nhorses among us are so mixed in their descent from the breeds which\r\nhave been introduced at various times from abroad, as to be almost as\r\nnear of kin to one as to another. Success in breeding will depend far\r\nmore upon attention to selection in regard to structure and endowments\r\nthan to names. Although it may be somewhat beyond the scope of an\r\nattempt to treat merely of the principles of breeding to offer remarks\r\nregarding its practice, a few brief hints may be pardoned; and first,\r\nlet far more care be taken in respect of breeding mares. Let none be\r\nbred from which are too old, or of feeble constitution, or the\r\nsubjects of hereditary disease. No greater mistake can be made than to\r\nsuppose that a mare fit for nothing else, is worthy to be bred from.\r\nIf fit for this, she is good for much else--gentle, courageous, of\r\ngood action, durable and good looking; outward form is perhaps of less\r\nimportance than in the male, but serious defect in this greatly\r\nlessens her value. She should be _roomy_, that is the pelvis should be\r\nsuch that she can well develop and easily carry and deliver the foal.\r\nYouatt says, \"it may, perhaps, be justly affirmed that there is more\r\ndifficulty in selecting a good mare to breed from, than a good horse,\r\nbecause she should possess somewhat opposite qualities. Her carcass\r\nshould be long to give room for the growth of the foetus, yet with\r\nthis there should be compactness of form and shortness[27] of leg.\"\r\n\r\nThe next point is the selection of a stallion. It is easy enough to\r\nsay that he should be compactly built, \"having as much goodness and\r\nstrength as possible condensed in a little space,\" and rather smaller\r\nrelatively than the mare, that he should be of approved descent and\r\npossess the forms, properties and characteristics which are desired to\r\nbe perpetuated. It is not very difficult to specify with tolerable\r\naccuracy what forms are best adapted for certain purposes, as an\r\noblique shoulder, and depth, rather than width, of chest are\r\nindispensable for trotting; that in a draft horse this obliquity of\r\nshoulder is not wanted, one more upright being preferable, and so\r\nforth; but after all, a main point to secure success is _relative\r\nadaptation of the parents to each other_, and here written directions\r\nare necessarily insufficient and cannot supply the place of skill and\r\njudgment to be obtained only by careful study and practical\r\nexperience; nor is it always easy, even if fully aware of the\r\nnecessary requirements, to find them in the best combination in the\r\nhorses nearest at hand. A stallion may be all which can be desired for\r\none dam and yet be very unsuitable for another. In this aspect we can\r\nperceive how valuable results may accrue from such establishments as\r\nnow exist in various sections of the country, where not a single\r\nstallion only is kept, but many, and where no pains nor expense are\r\nspared to secure the presence of superior specimens of the most\r\napproved breeds, and choice strains of blood in various combinations;\r\nso that the necessary requirements in a sire are no sooner fairly\r\napprehended than they are fully met. On this point therefore, my\r\nsuggestion is, that this relative adaptation of the parents to one\r\nanother be made the subject of patient and careful study; and a word\r\nof caution is offered lest in the decisions made, too great importance\r\nbe attached to speed alone. That speed is an element of value is not\r\ndoubted, nor do I intimate that he who breeds horses to sell, may not\r\naim to adapt his wares to his market as much as the man who breeds\r\nneat cattle and sheep, or the man who manufactures furniture to sell.\r\nBut I do say that speed may be, and often has been, sought at too dear\r\na rate, and that bottom, courage, docility and action are equally\r\nelements of money value and equally worthy of being sought for in\r\nprogeny. Nor is it unlikely that an attempt to breed for these last\r\nnamed qualities, with a proper reference to speed, would result in the\r\nproduction of as many fast horses as we now get, and in addition to\r\nthis, a much higher average degree of merit in the whole number\r\nreared.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion may not be out of place. Hitherto (if we except\r\nfast trotting) there has been little attention paid to breeding for\r\nspecial purposes, as for draft horses, carriage horses, saddle horses,\r\netc., and the majority of people at the present time undoubtedly\r\nprefer horses of all work. This is well enough so long as it is a fact\r\nthat the wants of the masses are thus best met, but it is equally true\r\nthat as population increases in density and as division of labor is\r\ncarried farther, it will be good policy to allow the horse to share in\r\nthis division of labor, and to breed with reference to different uses;\r\njust as it is good policy for one man to prepare himself for one\r\ndepartment of business and another for another. The same principle\r\nholds in either case.\r\n\r\nSufficient attention has never been paid to the breaking and training\r\nof horses. Not one in a thousand receives a proper education. It ought\r\nto be such as to bring him under perfect control, with his powers\r\nfully developed, his virtues strengthened and his vices eradicated.\r\nWhat usually passes for breaking is but a distant approximation to\r\nthis. The methods recently promulgated by Rarey and Baucher are now\r\nattracting attention, and deservedly too, not merely for the immediate\r\nprofit resulting from increased value in the subjects, but in view of\r\nthe ultimate results which may be anticipated; for, as we have seen\r\nwhen treating of the law of similarity, acquired habits may in time\r\nbecome so inbred as to be transmissible by hereditary descent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] This was commenced by a cross of Coelebs, a Short-horn bull, upon\r\na common cow of remarkable excellence.\r\n\r\n[25] Annals of Agriculture, Vol. 11, p. 224.\r\n\r\n[26] The Hampshires are somewhat larger than the South Downs, and quite\r\nas hardy--the fleece a trifle shorter. The Oxford Downs are not to be\r\nconfounded with the New Oxfordshires.\r\n\r\n[27] Mr. Youatt here probably refers to length below, rather than\r\nabove, the knee and hock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in text:                   |\r\n    |                                                           |\r\n    | Page  34: maratime replaced with maritime                 |\r\n    | Page  53: analagous replaced with analogous               |\r\n    | Page 155: suceeding replaced with succeeding              |\r\n    |                                                           |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Principles of Breeding, by S.
