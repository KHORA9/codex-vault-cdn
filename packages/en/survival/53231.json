Randall._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Judge William D. Kelley was an intensely practical man, and\r\nso not given to rhapsody, but he has left on record that Western\r\nNorth Carolina was the most beautiful country upon which his feet\r\nor eyes ever rested. He had visited many lands and gazed upon many\r\ntranscendent panoramas unrolled by the Master of the Universe. He was\r\na loyal and devoted son of Pennsylvania, and enthusiastically loved\r\nand admired her noble scenery, but when he beheld the unrivalled\r\nmajesty and picturesqueness of Western North Carolina, his honest\r\nsoul expanded with the prospect, and, in a burst of genuine candor,\r\nhe declared that never before had he looked upon a region at once so\r\nsublime and entrancing. What Judge Kelley uttered has been, by many\r\nother enthusiasts, repeated in varying phrase and similar tenor. It\r\nis not called the Land of the Sky because of its altitude. There are\r\nnumerous localities that surpass it in this particular, but rather,\r\nI think, because of a peculiar phenomenon of the region, where the\r\nazure atmosphere that we call the skies descends, or seems to do so,\r\nactually and magically upon the tree tops and mountain sides, so that\r\nthe dazzled spectator almost instinctively puts forth his hand to grasp\r\nthe mysterious panoply. When a child of earth is thus moved, as it\r\nwere, by heaven, with the blue ether glorified by sunlight, and the\r\nalpine groups transformed in shape by fugitive clouds, no wonder his\r\nmind becomes blissfully inebriated, his soul uplifted, and his senses\r\nplumed to take wing from the solid globe that imprisons his feet. The\r\ndullest fancy cannot resist the spell.\r\n\r\nThe ardent, poetic temperament has a conditional foretaste of what\r\nit is to escape the flesh envelope and assume spiritual alertness.\r\nBut it is not always thus that this gorgeous land presents itself. It\r\nhas moods of tremendous energy, and to make returning mildness more\r\nalluring, as the cunning master of music intersperses rude chords in\r\nhis glorious melody, it veils the comely perfection of its face in a\r\nstorm of frowns, but only such as triumphant beauty can assume betimes.\r\nThen the alpine cliffs are garmented with mist, while the Hyder Ali of\r\nCloud Land poises on the declivities, concentrated with black wrath,\r\nbefore rushing down in fragmentary battalions upon the plains below.\r\nBut there is no ravage. The little hut of the inhabitant remains\r\nunscathed, still emitting from its rough chimney a curling smoke, and\r\nthe lordly mansion, perched on some aspiring peak, stands steadfast,\r\nwhile the fairy maiden shrined there playfully dabbles her white\r\nfingers in the foam of the upper deep. From the dark canopy of the\r\ngreat giant of the Smoky range leaps the live lightning, and a thunder\r\nroll bellows or crackles or mutters in a myriad strange defiles, but\r\nwe know that behind this lowering front, hinting of God’s smile behind\r\nthe tempest, our winsome Lady of the Sky is laughing still, with the\r\nspring in her brilliant eyes, and the wild flowers, smitten by sunshine\r\nin her golden hair. Anon, as the seasons are made mutable, another\r\nphase is disclosed. The air grows cold as if in the clutch of some\r\nSiberian intruder, and feathery flakes pour down their “snow storm of\r\nstars,” and the mighty monsters of the mountain world yield placidly\r\nto their chill, pallid cerements, but we feel that this is one of our\r\nenchanter’s displays of infinite variety, and that our spirits are held\r\nin thrall for another transformation. And what a valiant exaltation\r\nthe chill breath of the ozone-ladened breeze fixes in our blood, and\r\nwhat roses in our cheeks! How we dominate with resistless stride the\r\npedestrian paths, or how we credit the fable of the Centaur, when, in\r\nthe fervor of environment, we partake of the joy and very existence of\r\nthe nimble steed we have bestrode adventurously! In other climes and\r\nwith other surroundings we have felt languor, or dullness, or restive\r\nincapacity, but here, with the potent inspiration of the panorama\r\nand the atmosphere, our whole being bounds with daring briskness and\r\nmastering activity. In the overwhelming sense of powerful forces put\r\nin play, we do not ask if life be worth living, but thank God that we\r\nare alive and filled with the alchemy of Sky Land. When these agencies\r\nreact and demand the unbent bow, we lounge, it may be on the porches\r\nof the grand hotel, with eyes restful upon Pisgah and the enormous\r\npetrifaction of the rat that never budges from its lair. Perchance,\r\nwith appetite made robust and undeniable, we attack the toothsome\r\nrepast provided, but ever and anon we glance through the big windows\r\nat the splendid pictures beyond, as if we were afraid that some stray\r\nexpression of the amphitheatre would escape us unaware. We stroll,\r\nhappy and satisfied, to the piazza, and loll in an easy chair, puffing\r\nat pipe or cigar, but never ceasing to confront admiringly the scenes\r\nthat intoxicated us from the first. The sun has driven its fiery,\r\nglowing chariot beyond the vast barrier of loam and basalt, but left\r\na sparkling, glowing, radiant wake behind. The clouds are blushing\r\nlike traditional brides, and the sorcerer of the sky has grouped them\r\namong shining lakes and islands and the watching perspective that\r\nthis inimitable artist alone can fashion and dissolve. You presently\r\nunderstand how the poet merely revealed what he had seen when Night\r\ndropped her crimson mantle and pinned it with a star. And it was no\r\nexaggeration when the grim Carlyle bade us witness how Bootes drags his\r\nreluctant dogs in a leash of sidereal fire, or how mailed Orion flames\r\nhis plumes ’mid bright-battalioned planets. As the mystic dusk robes\r\nthe familiar scenery with a pall, we hear the insect world, if it be\r\nthe proper season, conversing in a thousand tongues, startled anon by\r\nthe shrill cry of a night bird, and possibly we wonder if the momentary\r\nshadow on the orb of the moon was the vagrant pinion of Minerva’s\r\nbird, or the flashing stroke of the eagle, put to flight from his\r\neyry slumber. Then the vision fades, and some drowsy sprite, circling\r\nin the atmosphere, infects us with somnolency. We cannot resist it,\r\nunless perchance strong coffee or some such insidious decoction has\r\nviolated, for a time, the blessed ministering of sleep that men, who\r\nhave betrayed or lost it, would give millions to enjoy. We move to our\r\napartment in amiable indolence, and hardly has our head touched the\r\ninviting pillow when we reach that condition wherein, as Lew Wallace\r\nsays, even the wicked cease to sin. And if we have scientifically and\r\nrationally allowed the wholesome air to enter a little at the top and\r\na little at the bottom of our window, what slumber we enjoy, unless we\r\nhave deliberately assailed and violated every law conducive to repose!\r\nWe know that while we rest no noxious thing can enter our lungs, but\r\nthe pure, sweet, invigorating wind from the heights is visiting our\r\nwhole system and repairing what other atmospheres may have put in\r\nperil. What a blessing, after such refreshment, to rise in the earlier\r\nmorning and prayerfully go to the window for another glance at the\r\nwonderland that has made us a willing prisoner to its enticements! We\r\nsalute the mountains as loyal friends, and they, after a vogue of their\r\nown, appear to reciprocate our salute. They, too, appear renovated\r\nwith the dews of night, and their variegated vestments glitter with\r\nadornment. The fascinating curves of the French Broad river cleave\r\nthe landscape, and the swift, clear tide laves the feet of the giant\r\npeaks, whose fertile valleys, smiling it may be with agricultural\r\nabundance, betoken that this is a fertile as well as a grand and\r\nattractive region. How that fine farm called Tahkeostee projects itself\r\nlike an immense backbone upon the undulating piedmont, and how you\r\nscheme about the happiness of a proprietor who holds the title to such\r\na domain! But you need a nearer view, and, as all manner of vehicles\r\nor horses are at disposal, you take an excursion there, crossing the\r\nrailway track and handsome bridge to emerge upon a firm country road.\r\nYou look back, and the prospect is brave with splendid hotels, villas\r\nof all manner of architecture, and the city of Asheville, which,\r\nbecause chiefly of the tourist travel, is rapidly taking rank with the\r\nfirst cities of the State, by manufacturing, by drainage and by the\r\ndiscovery that all of the pure air on earth cannot make amends for\r\nwater contamination. And so, with generous, innocent fountain sources\r\neverywhere at the bidding of man, Asheville and all Western Carolina\r\nhave nothing to crave for in the way of physical health and happiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEWS NEAR ASHEVILLE.]\r\n\r\nWooed by the spirit of adventure, you spur your horse higher and\r\nhigher up the ascent, and find that some rich man has fixed his abode\r\nin more or less of grandeur atop the alpine plateau, and you look\r\ndown upon humbler mountains and far away into the vista, where the\r\nlocomotive is pushing its path from Henderson, or it may be Hickory\r\nGap. Descending the road you follow along the bright, rippling stream,\r\npassing habitations of various kinds, now rude or humble, and now\r\ncomfortable or charming. At last you reach a spot that the poet Moore\r\nwould have raved about in undying song, for it is worthy of any singer,\r\nwho, however tuneful, might well despair of bringing justice to the\r\nrealm of so much beauty. The dwelling there is not a palace, but\r\nevidently the abode of taste and wealth. The garden is what you have\r\ndreamed about, when young and addicted to Lalla Rookh. What a wealth\r\nof flowers and how artistically displayed! The air is perfumed all\r\nabout this fairy kingdom and you instinctively look askance for the\r\napparition of Prince Charming, or the Fair One with the Golden Locks.\r\nThe Prince I have not seen, but the Fair One was visible and, with her\r\nguidance, I am permitted, in a luxurious nook, to scan the surrounding\r\nglories. There is no other just such site for perfect habitation, for\r\nit is at the meeting of the waters, which glisten far below. Here the\r\nimpetuous French Broad rushes to the embrace of the gentle Swannanoa,\r\nand here their mingled tides laughingly and pellucidly hasten to kiss\r\nthe awaiting and absorbing sea. The mountains are marshalled on dress\r\nparade in one mighty ring around this centre of loveliness, and the\r\ndream you have fallen voluntarily into is only dissolved, and not\r\nunpleasantly, by the matter-of-fact tracks of steel that glisten at the\r\nbase of the hill, and the snorting or clanging or whistling engine that\r\nplunges, with its train, toward the station, which is now, by local\r\nsignificance, well known as the place where our modern Kubla Khan, Mr.\r\nGeorge Vanderbilt, must alight to visit the matchless pleasure dome\r\nhe has decreed on the heights beyond the summer lodge of the Fair One\r\nwith the Golden Locks, where, in imagination, we are now spectator.\r\nIt is needless to repeat how much Mr. Vanderbilt has spent or will\r\ncontinue to spend upon what fame heralds as the most complete and\r\nmagnificent estate owned by any private gentlemen, and one that few\r\nroyal personages could obtain. Without summing up the oft-repeated and\r\ndry statistics of the dimension of his residence, out-houses, stables,\r\nbarns and acres, it is enough to understand that, after the method of\r\nanother marvelous man who has metamorphosed St. Augustine, unstinted\r\nopulence and modern art have met for material transformation. No\r\namount of money could reproduce the natural splendor of the location,\r\nbut science and skill and Aladdin’s lamp, which is ready money and a\r\nsuperabundance of it, can rear castles and improve grounds in a way to\r\nbe worthy of such scenes of Arcadian majesty and beauty all around.\r\nIt speaks well for the rich young man, who is highly educated, most\r\naccomplished, and a lover of literature in all of its development,\r\nwhile kind and gentle and benignant, that he should have determined\r\nupon this place of all the places in the world to rear his incomparable\r\nhome and be a veritable monarch of much that he surveyed, though not\r\nall. And yet, having once had vision of this alluring sphere, it would\r\nbe indeed a source of astonishment if it failed to exercise upon him\r\nthe sorcery I so feebly portray. The fancy takes flight and pictures\r\nto itself what may be the result of such a scheme. Will he, when\r\nthe palace is completed and everything exhausted to fashion it as\r\nhe aspired, be any more content than he was before? Will he abandon\r\nthe mighty Babylon of the East and abide at his gorgeous Southern\r\nhermitage, with its imperial setting? Will he simply flit there, from\r\ntime to time, and, at other seasons, leave his domain, like a haunted\r\npalace, a stupendous show-place or proverbial folly? Will he settle\r\nthere, and perchance wed the Fair One with the Golden Locks, becoming\r\nracy of the soil of the Old North State, dispensing joy, hospitality,\r\nmunificence and rational bounty? Will he, having more than emulated the\r\nauthor of Vathek in construction, live, like Beckford, to behold the\r\nruin of his aspiration? But what is the use of tossing these gilded\r\njuggler balls in the air of imagination, and making inquiries of that\r\nfuture which does not belong to any mortal? Suffice it practically,\r\nthat young Mr. Vanderbilt has appreciated the South, yielded homage to\r\nher natural magnetism, and made his deeds speak louder than words of\r\npraise. Let us take for granted that he will never weary of his designs\r\nand that Providence has in store for him and his surroundings special\r\nand exceptional benedictions.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to Mr. Vanderbilt’s principality are the grounds of the\r\nKenilworth Inn, which would have delighted Amy Robsart and disarmed\r\nher enemies. Never did British beauty of any country preceding this\r\ncommand, even at the hands of royalty, so many comforts as the\r\nKenilworth lavishly displays for the delectation of the most exacting\r\ncreature. When this is said, what need of multiplying words or\r\nmeasuring with yard-sticks the magnificence of the various compartments\r\nof the house or its broad baronial park? Unless you are impervious to\r\nall enticement, you will be impelled to see these marvels through your\r\nown eyes and then compare your impressions with mine.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you who visit Western North Carolina find instinct within you\r\nsome of the fiery blood of Orion or Nimrod or Buffalo Bill, and wish\r\nto exercise it in the slaughter of beasts and birds. Well, with your\r\nimproved weapon, with all modern lethal devices, in dear old clothes\r\nthat are already creased in the seams and baggy at the knees, you\r\nmay, with the rugged father of Esmeralda, or one of her tough, nimble\r\nbrothers, follow the black bear to his cave or track partridges,\r\ngrouse or squirrels to their leafy haunts, and make them acquainted\r\nwith death or anguish. You may, even without having conned the pages\r\nof Isaak Walton, be impassioned for snaring diplomatic and pugnacious\r\ntrout, with an insect engendered by the artificer or with the native\r\nminnow; and, if so, your selection of streams will be easy and your\r\ngame-bag should be bulging with trophies when you homeward wend your\r\nway, with appetite of a ploughman for the fare of a French chef who has\r\nbeen beguiled by Col. Coxe as the presiding genius of his kitchen and\r\nlarder. And the Colonel will, after supper, make merry with you, as\r\nbecomes an elegant gentleman, who has carried his accomplishments all\r\nover the world, and who laughingly declares that he is “the only man\r\nextant who was killed on both sides during the war.” He had possessions\r\nat the North and South, and his respective substitutes were among the\r\nunreturning brave. So, by proxy, he was slain twice, and yet is still\r\nalive to the gratification of a host of friends and admirers. You will\r\nbe sure to get an invitation from him to drive, with a jocund company\r\nof both sexes, in his tally-ho-coach, which is as well appointed as\r\nany in the land, and it is a memorable thing to see him handle the\r\nribbons over four thoroughbreds that were nurtured on bluest and most\r\nsucculent of Kentucky grass. A drive with Colonel Coxe and such ladies\r\nand gentlemen as he groups around him is an experience that you will\r\nfondle, some day, when business or a kindred commonplace tie fetters\r\nyou to a dull or smoky town. You will then comprehend that poor girl, a\r\nrustic heroine and living martyr, when she could forgive the miserable\r\nman who had repaid her with ingratitude and desertion, but could not\r\ndivine how, though he left her, he could leave “The Mountings.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT MITCHELL--6700 FEET ABOVE THE SEA.]\r\n\r\nIn a rollicking mood you may venture to pay a pop-call on Bill Nye,\r\nwho, though he pokes perfunctory, periodical fun at the Sky Land,\r\nclings to it, when he can, like a fellow does to his skin, and, in\r\nserious interludes, loves even its occasionally disreputable roads,\r\nwhich are, at any rate, picturesque and informal. He may escort you\r\nto a friend’s place of concealment, the den of “the chemist,” the\r\nalchemist of moonshine whiskey, warranted, no doubt, to kill at three\r\nhundred yards. I have always pitied these proscribed brethren, the\r\nvictims of our internal, or what no less a person than Thomas Jefferson\r\nis credited with denominating “infernal” law. The moonshiner naturally\r\nhas as much right to boil his fruit or grain into spirits as the farmer\r\nhas to put hominy hot in the caldron, but the law places a negative\r\nupon his claim, and fosters and pampers the trusts that so much trouble\r\nthe Democratic conscience, but are ingeniously utilized to pay pensions\r\nor run the government. So the mountain chemist is given to hiding and,\r\nat times, when hunted too persistently, to shooting his pursuers. This\r\nis all wrong, because unlawful, but it is hard to instruct the grey\r\nmatter of his brain on such subjects. It is grewsome to see these\r\nlank, leathery, unkempt, semi-barbarous brethren brought into court\r\nwith manacles on their limbs and summarily consigned to doleful exile\r\nin distant dungeons. You will, when you see them and their wives and\r\ntheir progeny, wonder how such a country can produce such specimens\r\nof humanity, but it is easily understood when explanation is at hand.\r\nIn that region are reared the best of cattle, sheep, poultry and\r\nfruits, but the moonshiner disdains them. He prefers, or habit and\r\npoverty compel him to prefer, soggy, hot biscuit, excessive coffee,\r\ncadaverous, greasy bacon, assassinated in a frying pan. He drinks too\r\nmuch of his own fiery decoction and too little of the salubrious water\r\nthat leaps, gushes and sparkles on every hand. If one could capture\r\nyoung moonshiner girls and boys, feed them on civilized diet, girdle\r\nthem with proper comfort, garment them decently, treat them amiably\r\nand educate them wholesomely, the transformation would be thorough,\r\nstartling and supreme. It would be an object lesson conveying its own\r\nmoral, and this would be the evolution of many Esmeraldas off the mimic\r\nstage, and many a sturdy, comely, valiant, intellectual man, who might\r\nsucceed in the Senate such typical Carolinians as Vance and Ransom.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Vance, if you loitered in Sky Land, in midsummer, you\r\nmight make your way to Gombroon, his highland roost, and be sure of an\r\nold-fashioned welcome. No man has a heartier nature and no man is more\r\nof an adorer, so to speak, of Western North Carolina. He would tell\r\nyou characteristic anecdotes of his wonderful career and hold you, as\r\nthe ancient mariner did the wedding guests, with wit and wisdom, such\r\nas Master Coleridge never “dreamt of in his philosophy.” So you would\r\nunderstand from him what potent possibilities this clime possesses, and\r\nhow from the very elements there is distilled a subtle essence that\r\nholds in solution the formation of noble men and beautiful women.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, you had an agreeable, harmonious company of friends\r\nand acquaintances at Battery Park Hotel, and longed for an ideal trip,\r\nnot too long, and which would entertainingly add to your stock of\r\nenchantment, I doubt not that Mr. McKissick, who is young and genial\r\nand intelligent, as becomes a cavalier South Carolinian and manager of\r\na great caravanserai, would suggest a trip to the Hot Springs, which,\r\nby rail, is not many miles away. If you could prevail upon McKissick\r\nto join your party, it would be an accentuated treat, for he has been\r\nan ardent, expert, accomplished newspaper man, and is bubbling over\r\nwith high health and fresh humor. This maroon is altogether delicious.\r\nFrom the car window you get rapid but incessantly changing views of the\r\nFrench Broad, which, crossed and recrossed and paralleled, is never\r\nout of sight. It is mild and clear flowing; it is turbulent, swift\r\nand vocal; it is free from impediment; it is vexed with rapids and\r\nfrustrated with boulders as if a battle of Titans had been contested\r\nto stormy demolition; it is always charming. The time consumed in the\r\npassage has never for an instant tormented you, and even the most\r\nvoluble talker is content to let his tongue “keep Sunday”--as an old\r\ndarkey said--in the presence of this water course which descends in\r\nglory through the mountain defiles. These mountains enclose you, but\r\nthey are not like their Swiss family bare and bleak and tawny, but\r\nlush with emerald foliage or cultivated to their very brows. The\r\nMountain Park Hotel at Hot Springs, like all first-class establishments\r\nhereabout, is equipped sumptuously. It has miles of piazzas. It nestles\r\nin a happy valley. The river runs hard by, and, at this point, is\r\nnarrow but energetic. It is a cold stream, but here, a few feet from\r\nthe surface, hot fountains are latent, and any positive disturbance\r\nof the earth-crust is followed by vaporous exhalations. The baths are\r\nseductive, the more so, perhaps, because you are immersed in dazzling\r\nmarble tanks and the liquid purrs you like velvet in motion. You can\r\ndrink vast quantities of this fluid for it has amazing lightness and\r\nmakes a delicate stomach feel “like a gentleman.” Wondrous tales are\r\ntold of its curative faculties, and I take for granted that a rheumatic\r\nor dyspeptic man or woman soon gets ashamed, in such ablution and\r\nbibulation, of racking muscles and azure imps. By what volcanic agency\r\nthis phenomenon occurs we can only conjecture. The probability is that\r\nthe central fires are nearer than usual to the surface, or that the\r\nboiling waters that can ordinarily be reached by hard, pertinacious\r\nmining toil, thousands of feet deep, find here some propulsion and\r\nchannel of their own and need only a touch to make them disclose their\r\nvirtues. If they do not “create a spirit under the ribs of death,”\r\nthey spur on an appetite that may have lost all zest, and when a man is\r\nimpatient for his meals and partakes of them with satisfaction, disease\r\nhas small hold upon him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SWANNANOA.]\r\n\r\nOne of the weird sights of this region is a mountain fire. On a dark\r\nnight such conflagrations are, of course, more spectacular, and when\r\nbelts of flame cover large areas and are detached fiercely from one\r\nanother, the resemblance to Kilauea, the burning lake of the Sandwich\r\nIsland, is startling. In these days of Hawaiian perturbation and\r\ndiscussion one could easily imagine that he was in the Eden Isle of the\r\nPacific ocean, and might look for dusky maidens darting by on horseback\r\nwith red hybiscus flowers blushing in their lustrous black hair.\r\n\r\nThis enchanted region is reached by the Richmond & Danville railroad,\r\nwhose lines furnish approach also to many other places in the alpine\r\nlocation of South Carolina and Georgia that merit equal attention\r\nwith these scenes so imperfectly described or sketched from memory.\r\nCæsar’s Head, near Greenville, is a genuine curiosity, and even the\r\nold European or Rocky Mountain traveller admits that the prospect from\r\nthis precipitous elevation is awesome and inspirational. At the old\r\ntown of Clarksville, in North Georgia, the scenery is transcendent.\r\nOnce you have seen Mount Yonah you will never forget it, and when will\r\never fade from your recollection the prodigious carving, by witchery in\r\ndistant perspective, of the Cherokee chief stretched gigantically upon\r\nhis sky-line bier? From the porches of Roseneath villa you best discern\r\nthis strange conformation. There he extends, in tremendous dimensions,\r\ngraven on the horizon, a distinct and spectral Indian shape, with\r\ndrooping plumes. The people thereabout know him familiarly as\r\nSkiahjagustah. You may, in quest of gold, for the region is full of it,\r\nseek to penetrate this mysterious personage, but he will vanish as you\r\napproach him, transformed to common rock and tree and shrub, and yet\r\nreappear by enchantment when you go back to Roseneath and summon him\r\nfrom beyond the Soquee river. Here asthma has no clutch and rheumatism\r\nceases to torment. A German workman came here crippled from New Jersey,\r\nand presently grew perfectly well in this climate. He is busily at work\r\nin wood and iron in a shop of his own, and happy in possession of a\r\nlittle farm, which has a famous vineyard like unto those which gem the\r\nbanks of the Rhine or Moselle.\r\n\r\nJust beyond Clarksville is one of the most beautiful valleys in all\r\nthis world--the Vale of Nacoochee--with Yonah dominating the fertile\r\nplain, and the upper Chattahoochee river purling around it. Here the\r\nmound builders of the continent had cherished habitation, and here\r\nthey left monumental signs of their existence. Here the Cherokee\r\nloved to dwell, and just on the banks of the river and circumjacent\r\nto the mound, where clover and corn attain exceptional proportions,\r\nis a cemetery fat with Indian death. From Clarksville to Toccoa and\r\nTallulah Falls is a mere jaunt of an hour or so. But why attempt to\r\nportray the graceful cascade and the terrible torrent? Ben Perley\r\nPoore, who had roamed in many lands and had adoration of all sights\r\nof nature of a high and exceptional kind, once told me that after all\r\nof his wanderings the scenes that lingered longest and fondest in his\r\nmemory were those around Clarksville and Tallulah. Oh, you must see for\r\nyourself the unrivalled Georgia waterfall, with its tremendous chasm\r\nand precipitous descent, not in one roar of waters, but by successive\r\nleaps and bounds and plunges, alternately divided in swirling pools\r\nbefore dashing headlong down to the palpitating plain. Each fall is\r\ndistinct in itself and of varied fury, as you will perceive either\r\nfrom the brink of the abyss or in touch with the vital torrent. This,\r\ntoo, is the Sky Land--glorious land--and here, in the coming time, as\r\nelsewhere in the alpine region of the South, many thousands will come\r\necstatically. St. Augustine waited long for a Flagler and Asheville\r\nfor a Coxe, but they came in the ripeness of time and amazingly well\r\ndid they perform the work appointed for them. If some men like these\r\nshould, in their opulence, propose to magnify Clarksville, Nacoochee\r\nand Tallulah, what new splendors will come to the Land of the Sky, and\r\nwhat blessings will be lavished upon thousands of human beings who only\r\nneed to know the South to love it, and who are beckoned back to health\r\nand strength and happiness where\r\n\r\n    “Far, vague and dim,\r\n    The mountains swim.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH BEFORE THE WAR.\r\n\r\n_By Richard H. Edmonds._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand and appreciate the progress made by the South\r\nduring the last ten years it is necessary to know something of its\r\ncondition prior to the war and immediately after that disastrous\r\nstruggle. “The New South,” a term which is so popular everywhere\r\nexcept in the South, is supposed to represent a country of different\r\nideas and different business methods from those which prevailed in\r\nthe old ante-bellum days. The origin of the term has been a subject\r\nof much discussion, but the writer has rarely seen it ascribed to\r\nwhat he believes to have been the first use of it. During the war the\r\nharbor and town of Port Royal, S. C., were in the possession of the\r\nNorthern forces, and while they were stationed there a paper called\r\n“The New South” was established by Mr. Adam Badeau, who was afterwards\r\nGeneral Grant’s secretary. This was probably the first time that the\r\nterm was applied to the Southern States. Its use now, as intended to\r\nconvey the meaning that the progress of the South of late years is\r\nsomething entirely new and foreign to this section, something which\r\nhas been brought about by an infusion of outside energy and money\r\nis wholly unjust to the South of the past and present. It needs but\r\nlittle investigation to show that prior to the war the South was\r\nfully abreast of the times in all business interests, and that the\r\nwonderful industrial growth which it has made since 1880 has been\r\nmainly due to Southern men and Southern money. The South heartily\r\nwelcomes the investment of outside capital and the immigration of\r\nall good people, regardless of their political predilections, but it\r\ninsists that it shall receive from the world the measure of credit\r\nto which it is entitled for the accomplishments of its own people.\r\nIn the rehabilitation of the South after the war Southern men led\r\nthe way. Out of the darkness that enveloped this section until 1876\r\nthey blazed the path to prosperity. They built cotton mills and iron\r\nfurnaces and demonstrated the profitableness of these enterprises.\r\nSouthern men founded and built up Birmingham, which first opened the\r\neyes of the world to the marvellous mineral resources of that section,\r\nand to Southern men is due the wonderful progress of Atlanta, one of\r\nthe busiest and most thriving cities in the United States. When the\r\npeople of the South had done this then Northern capitalists, seeing the\r\nopportunities for money-making, turned their attention to that favored\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe Southern people do not lack in energy or enterprise, nor did\r\nthey prior to 1860. Since the formation of this government they\r\nhave demonstrated in every line of action, in political life, on\r\nthe battlefield, in literature, in science and in great business\r\nundertakings, that in any sphere of life they are the peers of the\r\nmost progressive men in the world. From the settlement of the colonies\r\nuntil 1860 the business record proves this. After 1865 the conditions\r\nhad been so completely changed that the masses lacked opportunity, and\r\nto that alone was due their seeming want of energy. The population was\r\nlargely in excess of the number required to do all of the work that\r\nwas to be done. At least one-half of the whole population was without\r\nemployment, for the war had destroyed nearly all the manufacturing\r\ninterests that had been in existence; agriculture was almost the only\r\nsource of work for the masses. With no consumers for diversified farm\r\nproducts it would have been folly to raise them. Cotton and cotton\r\nalone was the only crop for which a ready market could be found, and it\r\nwas also the only crop which could be mortgaged in advance of raising\r\nfor the money needed for its cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Northern farmer is enterprising. He raises fruits and vegetables\r\nand engages in dairying and kindred enterprises because he has a home\r\nmarket for these things. The Southern farmer had none and could not\r\ncreate one. He might deplore his enforced idleness when he saw his\r\nfamily in want, but that would not bring him buyers for his eggs or\r\nchickens or fruit when there was no one in his section to consume\r\nthem. The almost unlimited amount of work for the mechanics and day\r\nlaborers generally at the North enabled every man to find something to\r\ndo. In the South there was almost an entire absence of work of this\r\ncharacter. Men hung around the village stores because there was no work\r\nto be had which would yield them any returns. With the development of\r\nmanufactures there came a great change. The opportunity for work had\r\ncome, and the way in which the people who had hitherto been idlers\r\nrushed to the factories, the furnaces, and wherever employment could be\r\nsecured demonstrated that they only needed the chance to prove their\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nThe greatest blessing that industrial activity has brought to the South\r\nis that it is daily creating new work for thousands of hitherto idle\r\nhands, and creating a home market wherever a furnace or a factory is\r\nstarted for the diversified products of the farm. The latent energy of\r\nthe people has been stimulated into activity, and the whole South is at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut to fully understand the South in its relation to business matters,\r\nit is necessary to study its business history before the war had\r\nbrought about a degree of poverty which has no equal in modern history.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of this century, and even before then, the South led\r\nthe country in industrial progress. Iron making became an important\r\nindustry in Virginia, in the Carolinas and in Georgia, and Richmond,\r\nLynchburg and other cities were noted for the extent and variety of\r\ntheir manufactures. Washington’s father was extensively interested\r\nin iron making, and Thomas Jefferson employed a number of his slaves\r\nin the manufacture of nails. South Carolina was so imbued with the\r\nindustrial spirit that, about the beginning of the Revolution, the\r\nState government offered liberal premiums to all who would establish\r\niron works. By the census of 1810 the manufactured products of the\r\nCarolinas and Georgia exceeded in value and variety those of all\r\nNew England combined. The South Carolina Railway, from Charleston\r\nto Hamburg, built by the people of South Carolina, was the leading\r\nengineering accomplishment of its day, not only in this country, but of\r\nthe world. Greater than this, however, was the road projected by Robert\r\nY. Hayne, of Charleston, to connect Charleston and Cincinnati, and thus\r\nmake the former city the exporting and importing port for the great\r\nWest. Unfortunately for the South Hayne was sent to the United States\r\nSenate, and the growing sectional bitterness, because of slavery, so\r\ncompletely absorbed his attention that his great railroad undertaking\r\nhad to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe stimulation given to the cultivation of cotton by the introduction\r\nof the gin and the extension of slavery, with the liberal profits in\r\ncotton cultivation, as prices ruled high for most of the time from 1800\r\non to 1840, caused a concentration of capital and energy in planting.\r\nBut between 1840 and 1850 there were several years of low prices, and\r\nattention was once more directed to industrial pursuits. The decade\r\nending with 1860 witnessed a very marked growth in Southern railroad\r\nand manufacturing interests, but there was no decline in the steady\r\nadvance that was making the South one of the richest agricultural\r\nsections of the world. During this time railroad building was very\r\nactively pushed, and the South constructed 7562 miles of new road,\r\nagainst 4712 by the New England and Middle States combined. In 1850\r\nthe South had 2335 miles of railroad, and the New England and Middle\r\nStates 4798 miles; by 1860 the South had increased its mileage to 9897\r\nmiles, a quadrupling of that of 1850, while the New England and Middle\r\nStates had increased to 9510 miles, or a gain of only about 100 per\r\ncent. In 1850 the mileage of the two Northern sections exceeded that\r\nof the South by 2463 miles. The conditions were reversed by 1860,\r\nand the South then led by 387 miles. In the decade under review the\r\nSouth expended, according to official figures, over $220,000,000 in\r\nthe extension of its railroads, the great bulk of this having been\r\nlocal capital. This activity was not confined to any one State, but\r\ncovered the whole South, and every State made a rapid increase in its\r\nmileage. In Virginia there was an increase from 515 to 1771 miles; the\r\ntwo Carolinas gained from 537 to 1876 miles; Georgia from 643 to 1404;\r\nFlorida from 21 to 401; Alabama from 132 to 743; Mississippi from 75\r\nto 872; Louisiana from 79 to 334, and Kentucky from 78 to 569. Neither\r\nTexas, Arkansas nor Tennessee had a single mile of railroad in 1850,\r\nbut in 1860 Tennessee had 1197 miles, showing remarkable activity in\r\nconstruction during the decade, while Texas had 306 miles, and Arkansas\r\n38.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of increase in population in the South from 1850 to\r\n1860, even including the slaves, was 24 per cent., while in the rest\r\nof the country, the gain due largely to immigration, of which the\r\nSouth received none, was 42 per cent. Yet from 1850 to 1860 the South\r\nincreased its railroad mileage 319 per cent., while in the rest of the\r\ncountry the gain was only 234 per cent. The South had one mile of road\r\nin 1860 to every 700 white inhabitants; the other sections all combined\r\nhad one mile to every 1000 inhabitants. Thus counting the whites only,\r\nthe South led the country in its railroad mileage per capita, and if\r\nthe slaves be included, the South still stood on a par with the country\r\nat large in per capita railroad mileage.\r\n\r\nWhile devoting great attention to the building of railroads, the\r\nSouth also made rapid progress during the decade ending with 1860 in\r\nthe development of its diversified manufactures. The census of 1860\r\nshows that in 1850 the flour and meal made by Southern mills was worth\r\n$24,773,000, and that by 1860 this had increased to $45,006,000, a\r\ngain of $20,000,000, or nearly one-fourth of the gain in the entire\r\ncountry, and a much greater percentage of gain than in the country\r\nat large, notwithstanding the enormous immigration into the Western\r\ngrain-producing States during that period. The South’s sawed and planed\r\nlumber product of 1860 was $20,890,000 against $10,900,000 in 1850,\r\nthis gain of $10,000,000 being largely more than one-third as much as\r\nthe gain in all other sections combined, although even counting in the\r\nslaves the South had less than one-third of the country’s population.\r\n\r\nThe advance in iron founding was from $2,300,000 in 1850, to $4,100,000\r\nin 1860, a gain of $1,800,000, a very much larger percentage of\r\nincrease than in the whole country. In the manufacture of steam engines\r\nand machinery the gain in all of the country except the South was\r\n$15,000,000, while the gain in the South was $4,200,000, the increase\r\nin one case being less than 40 per cent, and in the other over 200\r\nper cent. Cotton manufacturing had commenced to attract increased\r\nattention, and nearly $12,000,000 were invested in Southern cotton\r\nmills. In Georgia especially this industry was thriving, and between\r\n1850 and 1860 the capital so invested in that State nearly doubled.\r\nIt is true that most of the Southern manufacturing enterprises were\r\ncomparatively small, but so were those of New England in their\r\nearly stages. The South’s were blotted out of existence by the war;\r\nNew England’s were made enormously prosperous, justifying a steady\r\nexpansion in size, by the same war. In the aggregate, however, the\r\nnumber of Southern factories swelled to very respectable proportions,\r\nthe total number in 1860 having been 24,590, with an aggregate capital\r\ninvested of $175,100,000.\r\n\r\nA study of the facts which have been presented should convince anyone\r\nthat the South in its early days gave close attention to manufacturing\r\ndevelopment, and that while later on the great profits in cotton\r\ncultivation caused a concentration of the capital and energy of that\r\nsection in farming operations, yet, after 1850, there came renewed\r\ninterest in industrial matters, resulting in an astonishing advance in\r\nrailroad construction and in manufactures. But this is only a small\r\npart of the evidence available to conclusively prove the great energy\r\nand enterprise of the six and a half million white people who inhabited\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\n(_To be Continued._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN ITALY.\r\n\r\n_By Erwin Ledyard._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Southern States of the Union have received only a small proportion\r\nof the tide of immigration that has flowed into this country during\r\nthe last half century, and especially during the last twenty-five\r\nyears, swelling the population of new commonwealths, causing towns to\r\nspring up, like Aladdin’s palace, in a night, and giving to cities a\r\ngrowth phenomenal and marvelous. It is not the purpose of this article\r\nto inquire why this has been the case; it is sufficient to state a\r\nfact that is indisputable. During the past decade the people of these\r\nSouthern States have turned their attention seriously to the question\r\nof attracting immigration, and thus increasing their industrial\r\nimportance and utilizing some portion of the immense tracts of land\r\nnow lying idle. Books and pamphlets descriptive of the climate, soil,\r\nproducts, and resources of the different States have been published,\r\nconventions have been held, and agents have been appointed. The\r\nresults of these efforts are now beginning to be seen. The number of\r\nforeign settlers in the South is steadily increasing, and the class\r\nof immigrants coming into the section is, generally speaking, a most\r\ndesirable one. They are men of sufficient intelligence to think and act\r\nfor themselves, and to leave the beaten paths that have been followed\r\nby most of their compatriots.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years the Irish were the most numerous class of\r\nimmigrants that came to the South. They settled for the most part in\r\nthe cities, and, as they have done elsewhere, early exhibited great\r\naptitude for politics, and much inclination for municipal offices. For\r\nthe most part they were useful and patriotic citizens, taking a deep\r\ninterest in public affairs and thriving in their various vocations.\r\nThen came the Germans, also industrious, and more thrifty than\r\ntheir Celtic predecessors. They also, with few exceptions, became\r\ninhabitants of cities. Caring less for the machinery and minutiæ of\r\npolitics than either Americans or Irish, they devoted a large portion\r\nof their leisure time to social relaxation, and to musical and dramatic\r\nsocieties, and taught native as well as foreign born citizens the\r\nuseful lesson that a moderate use of wine and beer would give much more\r\nrational enjoyment than an immoderate use of spirits, and would leave\r\nno headache afterwards.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, extending to some eight or ten years ago, few\r\nimmigrants coming into the South settled in the country. Some may\r\nhave realized that “God made the country but man made the town,” but\r\nfew felt like venturing into what was _terra incognita_ to them, a\r\nregion where, in their opinion, the negroes were the only people that\r\nploughed, hoed and planted, and where they would be compelled to\r\ncompete with that class of labor. More is now known about the South,\r\nand the fact that white men in that section have for years been working\r\nsmall farms by their own individual labor is now fully recognized,\r\nand in Texas and other Southern States citizens of foreign birth have\r\nturned their attention to tilling the soil. The tide of immigration no\r\nlonger spends itself when it reaches the cities.\r\n\r\nThis fact is especially apparent in the large counties of Mobile and\r\nBaldwin in the southern part of the State of Alabama. Some years ago\r\na settlement of Italians was located near Daphne in Baldwin county,\r\nclose to the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. The colony has thrived\r\nand prospered, engaging in fruit and grape culture and agricultural\r\npursuits. A short walk brings its members to the town of Daphne, where\r\nthey can look out upon a sheet of water thirty miles long and from\r\ntwelve to fifteen miles wide, which, though not so beautiful as Naples’\r\nfamous bay, is still fair to look upon, and glows sometimes with as\r\ngorgeous sunsets as those that are reflected by the blue waters of the\r\nMediterranean, while the smoke that rises from its shores is not that\r\nof a slumbering volcano threatening devastation and destruction, but of\r\nindustry and commerce, promising peace, prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe success of this colony is attracting other Italians to Baldwin\r\ncounty, and also to its neighbor across the bay, Mobile county. Quite a\r\nnumber have bought lands along the line of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad,\r\non a plateau or table land that begins some twenty miles from the city\r\nof Mobile, and which extends to the northern limit of the county.\r\nThis plateau is from 350 to 380 feet above the level of the sea, and\r\nfrom five to ten miles in width. The Italians who have settled on it\r\nhave cleared their land for cultivation and have built themselves\r\ncomfortable houses. They are all putting out fruit trees, principally\r\npears and plums, and grape cuttings of various kinds. The pear trees\r\nare mostly what are known as “Le Conte” and “Bartlett,” while the\r\ngrapes are “Delaware,” “Concord,” “Catawba” and some other varieties.\r\nThey will probably in time turn their attention to winemaking, and can\r\nthen make use of the “Scuppernong” grape that grows almost wild in the\r\nsection of country in which they have located and rarely fails to bear\r\nabundantly.\r\n\r\nThese Italians are a very different class of people from those one\r\nmeets in the purlieus of the fruit quarters or in the slums of large\r\ncities. They are mostly from the north of Italy, although some of\r\nthem hail from Naples and its neighborhood. They are intelligent,\r\nindustrious, orderly and law-abiding, and they are so polite and cheery\r\nin their manners and demeanor that it is a pleasure to meet them. They\r\nseem to regard people of property and position, near whose places they\r\nreside, in the light of friends and advisers, entitled to deference\r\nand respect. Many good people in this country have formed their ideas\r\nof Italians from what they have read of the lazzaroni of Naples or\r\nthe vendetta-loving inhabitants of Sicily. Others have an undefined\r\nnotion, gathered from operas and melodramas, that most Italians who are\r\nnot proprietors of hand-organs and monkeys wear either red nightcaps\r\nand striped shirts or tall hats shaped like the old time sugar-loaf,\r\njackets or coats with metal buttons and short coat tails, and leggins\r\ncomposed to a large extent of particolored ribbons. This costume they\r\naccentuate with a sash or belt containing a stiletto and a pair of\r\nvillainous looking horsepistols, and an old-fashioned muzzle-loading\r\ngun with a crooked stock. These simple folks would be much surprised\r\nif they could see the sons of Italy who have brought their lares and\r\npenates to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. They dress as the average\r\nAmerican citizen dresses and the only vendettas that they swear are\r\nagainst those birds and animals that injure their crops. Their hope\r\nis soon to sit under their own vine and fig-tree in a land truly\r\nflowing with milk and honey, and to make their lives bright with the\r\nlight-hearted gaiety and peaceful content that made existence pleasant\r\neven amidst the exactions and privations of sunny, but overtaxed and\r\novercrowded Italy. Already the sounds of music are borne on the evening\r\nair as these pioneers in a great movement of their race rest at the\r\nclose of day from their labors, and rejoice over their freedom from\r\nheavy burdens, and in that feeling of independence that the ownership\r\nof land gives to foreigners of small or moderate means.\r\n\r\nThese settlers can truly be regarded as to the advance guard of a\r\nrace movement that will eventually make of Southern Alabama, Southern\r\nMississippi and a portion of Western Florida an American Italy. The\r\ncoming of Italians to Alabama can no longer be considered as an\r\nexperiment. As has been previously stated, the settlement in Baldwin\r\ncounty was made some six or eight years ago. These people can live on\r\nless than either Americans or negroes, for they have been accustomed\r\nto the strictest economy at home. The great fault of the colored\r\nrace, and to a large extend of their white employers in the South, is\r\nwastefulness. When negroes can make a living on land in the section of\r\ncountry under consideration, Italians will surely be able to do so.\r\nThey have the utmost confidence in their ability to do so. The negro\r\nis not satisfied unless he has meat to eat every day in the year. The\r\nworkers on farms and in orchards and vineyards in Italy are accustomed\r\nto live on bread, fruit and vegetables for weeks at a time. Their\r\nrepasts often consist of a piece of bread and a bunch of grapes, or a\r\npiece of bread and an onion.\r\n\r\nThat this class of immigrants will greatly benefit the section to which\r\nit has been attracted, to use a Gallicism, goes without saying. They\r\nwill make good citizens, for they would not seek rural life if they\r\nwere the adherents of any special political propaganda. Experience\r\nhas fully demonstrated the fact that all foreigners holding extreme\r\nopinions in regard to government and social order that come to this\r\ncountry, Russian Nihilists, German Socialists, French Anarchists,\r\nIrish Dynamiters, and Italian Red Republicans, make their homes in\r\ncities, and generally in large ones. The quiet of country life is\r\ndistasteful to them. They must live in the midst of agitation and\r\nturmoil, and constantly attend gatherings where they deliver or listen\r\nto incendiary or socialistic harangues, or existence becomes almost\r\nunendurable to them. These settlers in South Alabama, on the contrary,\r\nare well satisfied with the institutions of the country to which they\r\nhave come in search of homes, appreciate the safety and security that\r\nare caused by the supremacy of law and order, and look forward to\r\nprosperous and happy lives in a land where war is unknown, where the\r\nbalance of power does not trouble the souls of statesmen, and where\r\nno immense armaments are maintained by imposing heavy and grievous\r\nburdens on the people. They have come to stay, and many will follow in\r\ntheir footsteps. The region to which they have betaken themselves has\r\nfor years been a market garden for the West. It will now also become\r\nan orchard and a vineyard. We are living in an age of progress, and\r\nwonderful changes and developments are ahead of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM NORTHERN AND WESTERN FARMERS, GIVING THEIR EXPERIENCE IN\r\nTHE SOUTH--VI.\r\n\r\n[The letters published in this issue form the sixth instalment in\r\nthe series commenced in the October number of this magazine. These\r\ncommunications are published in response to numerous inquiries from\r\nNorthern people who desire to know more about agricultural conditions\r\nin the South, and what is being accomplished by settlers from other\r\nsections of the country. These letters were written by practical\r\nfarmers and fruit-growers, chiefly Northern and Western people who\r\nhave made their homes in the South. The actual experiences of these\r\nsettlers, as set forth in these letters, are both interesting and\r\ninstructive to those whose minds are turned Southward.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit-Growing in Middle Georgia.\r\n\r\nCHARLES T. SMITH, Concord, Ga.--Concord is located in the fruit belt\r\nof Middle Georgia. The country is slightly rolling and well watered.\r\nThe soil is productive and can easily be brought to a very high state\r\nof fertility. For years cotton has been the staple crop, but King\r\nCotton has a powerful rival now in peaches and grapes. Fruit-growing\r\nwas introduced into Middle Georgia about twelve years ago. The first\r\nplantings were small and there were many scoffers. The industry proved\r\nto be very remunerative, and each year showed an increased acreage\r\nuntil fruit farms of 100 to 500 acres are now not uncommon, and\r\nhundreds of carloads of grapes and peaches are shipped annually and\r\nare known far and wide for their superior quality. Georgia grapes and\r\npeaches bring a higher price in all the leading markets than the same\r\nfruits from any other State in the Union, and with each season their\r\npopularity is increased.\r\n\r\nThe future outlook is very encouraging. The prices to be obtained now\r\nare not so large as heretofore, but with increased production came\r\nbetter methods of growing and hauling and better shipping facilities,\r\nand the profits to be derived are much the same, and far more\r\nsatisfactory than any other crops that can be grown. This industry has\r\nbeen largely fostered by Northern men, who have always been with the\r\nforemost in progress. Their efforts have been crowned with success, and\r\nthey may now look with pleasure not only on the handsome properties\r\nthey have amassed but also on this splendid new industry in the\r\ndevelopment of which they have been pioneers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Northern Man’s Observation of Southern People.\r\n\r\nL. S. PACKARD, Pine Bluff, Moore county, N. C., formerly of\r\nWarrensburg, N. Y.--Few persons realize from passing through the South\r\nwhat the soil is capable of producing under careful cultivation. After\r\na stay of several years among Southern people I have learned much about\r\nthem and their modes of work, the care the lands ought to have and the\r\nyields that can be expected under good cultivation. I give in brief my\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\nSouthern men and women are justly entitled to the credit they get for\r\nbeing the most hospitable people in the United States. The majority\r\nof them live easy, enjoy life and are contented to go forward in\r\nthe quiet ways of their fathers. Some, however, are branching out,\r\nlearning to make money and are accumulating fortunes on the farms and\r\nin the factories. It is the general belief of the Northern people that\r\nSouthern people cannot succeed.\r\n\r\nTo show an instance where a Southern born man has succeeded I shall\r\nconfine my article to one man and to one farm, and in my future\r\nletters give the names of Northern men who have come South. Within\r\na mile of the Seaboard Air Line in the county of Clark and State of\r\nGeorgia, Mr. John Smith has a farm of several hundred acres. He started\r\nwith small means but has improved, buying more land and stock, building\r\nlarger barns and better houses each year until he has one of the\r\nfinest and best equipped and regulated farms in the United States. His\r\ngrain, clover and grass fields are as fine as any in Pennsylvania or\r\nNew York. His stock is well kept and creditable in number and quality;\r\nthey will compare favorably with the best in Ohio, Michigan or any part\r\nof the Northwest. His cotton fields are beautiful beyond description.\r\nHe has every convenience in the way of modern machinery. He has built\r\nand equipped a railroad from his farm to Athens, Ga., and has erected\r\na cottonseed oil mill, fertilizer factory and conducts a general\r\nmercantile business to supply tenants and employees.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith’s farming operations were enough to convince me that all the\r\nsoil needed was careful cultivation and constant attention to yield\r\nthree times the profit of any in the Northern or New England States.\r\n\r\nRecently I met Mr. J. T. Patrick, of Southern Pines, N. C., who is\r\na noted worker for Southern development and perhaps one of the best\r\nposted men in the South in regard to the developments going on in that\r\nsection. I spoke to him about Mr. Smith. Mr. Patrick said: “I have seen\r\nhis farm and it is a credit to Mr. Smith and the South, but there are\r\nmany more Southerners who are doing as well as he, but I suppose you\r\nhave not seen their farms. Major R. S. Tucker, of Wake county, Dr. W.\r\nR. Capehart, of Bertie county, and thousands of others scattered over\r\nthe South are owners and managers of as fine farms as you can find\r\nin any part of the United States. You Northern people do not get out\r\nfrom the line of railroad to see what our people are doing, and we are\r\ngenerally judged, condemned and sentenced by people who ride through\r\nour country at the rate of forty miles an hour on a Pullman palace car\r\nand don’t know the difference between a cotton plant and a stalk of\r\nbuckwheat.”\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of truth in what Mr. Patrick said. Northern men\r\nwho come South to learn ought to come down prepared to stay long enough\r\nto go into the country and see the farms and not judge the South from a\r\npoorly conducted farm, but from those managed with intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Opinions Not Counted.\r\n\r\nJAMES M. DICKEY, Superintendent National Cemetery, Corinth, Miss.--In\r\n1881 I was a resident of Lamed-Pawnee county, Kansas. From March 1,\r\n1882, to March, 1884, was stationed at Barrancas, Fla., near Pensacola.\r\nFrom April, 1884, to the present time have been a resident of Corinth,\r\nMiss.\r\n\r\nMy observations during this time have been somewhat limited, but in\r\nthe material progress the agricultural classes have made considerable\r\nadvance. The old-time theory that cotton was the only crop to be raised\r\nwith profit has been discarded. Corn, potatoes, tomatoes, strawberries,\r\ngrapes, fruits, etc., and nearly all classes of products that the\r\ntruck gardener can raise will find remunerative sale. Climate and\r\nhealthfulness are exceptionally good. I have not been under the care of\r\na physician during the period of nine years.\r\n\r\nChurches are Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian and Christian. Schools of\r\nCorinth are public, graded into primary, intermediate, grammar and high\r\nschool. Seven months, with two months additional of pay school, to such\r\npatrons as may elect to send.\r\n\r\nThe one great and all important question that has been asked of me\r\nby visitors to this place is: “How do the people treat you? Are you\r\nostracized from society?” etc. My answer has been, and I have no\r\nreason to change it, that a person’s habits and deportment are his or\r\nher passport or entree to society. It makes no difference in North\r\nMississippi whether a person came from Georgia or Michigan; the social\r\nreception is the same.\r\n\r\nThe political liberality of the citizens is as good as anywhere. While\r\nhaving their own honest convictions, they respect the convictions of\r\nothers. My political views are in a minority, but during all this time\r\nno one has questioned or impugned my motives or convictions or hindered\r\nthe rights of suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiddle Georgia as Compared with the North and West.\r\n\r\nG. N. BARKER, Longstreet, Ga.--As one who has been a resident two years\r\nin Middle Georgia after ten years residence in the West and Northwest,\r\noccupied in stock raising, etc., I may be able to point out a few\r\nadvantages and differences relative to these parts. What will strike\r\nthe farmer most on arriving in this section is the total absence of\r\ngrass meadows or any visible facilities for the pasturing of stock,\r\nbut curiously enough, an abundance of fairly nutritious hay may be cut\r\nduring summer, of sufficient nutritive value with the assistance of a\r\nlittle grain for stock. The corn crop is light per acre to one used to\r\nthe West; oats, however, yield well when well cultivated, and are off\r\nthe ground in May, the same ground making also a good hay crop the same\r\nyear. Bermuda grass makes an inexhaustible supply of pasture for all\r\nstock, except three winter months when green rye, barley or oats will\r\ntake its place. Italian rye grass I have found grows luxuriantly during\r\nwinter and spring, and it makes more milk than almost any herb. Red\r\ntop grass also succeeds well. During summer there is an abundance of\r\nforage crops for all classes of stock, and of good nutritious quality.\r\nStock is healthy here, provided it is kept clean and not overfed with\r\ntoo highly fattening foodstuffs. My health has vastly improved in this\r\nclimate and I have recovered from the exposures of the Northwest. The\r\nland here is poor and run down, but good cultivation and moderate\r\nmanuring soon restore a fertility that is astonishing to anyone seeing\r\nonly what is done without fertilizer. The greatest drawbacks in this\r\nsection are the total inability of the laborer, merchant and business\r\nman to comprehend or encourage anything but cotton. All kinds of fruits\r\nflourish with good care bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\nFarmers coming from other parts will have to either do or closely\r\nsuperintend the minute details of their business; nothing can be left\r\nto the colored labor and they have not yet had any practice with the\r\nbetter methods or implements. Lumber is cheap; also carpenters very;\r\nto one accustomed to Western prices, so many comforts may be had\r\nunattainable out there. The heat is no drawback, not being anything\r\nlike the maximum attained in North Dakota and Montana, but the summer\r\nis long and debilitating to the newcomer, who must use discretion in\r\ntaking too much sun the first season. Good foundation stock of all\r\nkinds can be bought here at moderate prices. Living is very cheap\r\nand work not hard, if cotton is let alone, as there is more time\r\nall-the-year-round to work than in colder regions. Roads are moderate\r\nand railroads numerous, obviating the distances to be traveled out West\r\nto and from one’s station and postoffice. As a place of residence for\r\ncomfort, absence of great atmospheric changes, cheapness of living and\r\nland, and other things necessary to the comfort of a farmer, I consider\r\nthe South has many and varied advantages over the North and West.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom New Hampshire to North Carolina.\r\n\r\nR. M. COUCH, Southern Pines, N. C.--The statement of facts I shall\r\nmake in this letter will lean to the conservative in all cases, as\r\nafter a residence of eight years and an extensive correspondence with\r\ninquirers after facts, I have learned that the truth is good enough\r\nand exaggeration folly. By the advice of my physician I left New\r\nHampshire and located here, and have not been North even on a visit\r\nsince, and as the climate was the first consideration with me, let\r\nme say unqualifiedly that I believe it as near perfect all the year\r\nround as can be found in any part of the world. I am confirmed in this\r\nconclusion by the testimony of scores who have sought this haven of\r\nhealth after trying such places as Colorado, California, New Mexico,\r\nArizona, and even the South of France and Italy. The healthfulness of\r\nthis section being established, the next question which confronted me\r\nwas the means of support, and as we make no claim that this soil (a\r\nlight sandy loam) is adapted to general farming, we were compelled to\r\nlook to the fruit industry as the most likely to help us out, and well\r\nare we repaid for the venture. It is proved that a dry atmosphere and\r\nporous soil produces very fine flavored fruit and that in this climate,\r\nalso, the fruit “colors” up better and makes a much better appearance\r\nthan that grown in a colder and less sunny climate. But one strong hold\r\non the fruit industry lies in our geographical position as regards the\r\nripening season, which brings our fruit into market, out of competition\r\nwith any other section. This fact was proved by our shipments last\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nWithin five years there have been planted in this immediate section\r\n1500 acres in fruit, and in order that your readers may have the\r\nadvantage of direct correspondence with any or all the growers of\r\nfruit, I will give the names from memory: C. J. Eaglesfield was the\r\npioneer on a small scale; S. N. Whipple, extensive peach, plum, grape\r\nand nut farm; Van Lindly Orchard Co., 350 acres peach, pear, plum and\r\nblackberry; Niagara Grape Co., 107 acres in grapes; Southern Pines\r\nFruit-Growing Co., eighty acres in grapes; Benjamin Douglas, Jr., of\r\nOrange, N. J.; Tarbell & Carlton, H. P. Bilyeu, Dr. C. W. Weaver, C.\r\nD. Tarbell, Thomas Carlton, Fred Oberhouserheur, James H. Murray, S.\r\nW. Thomas, Charles H. Thompson, Edwin Newton, Doctors Boynton, Stevens\r\nand R. M. Couch, Rev. A. A. Newhall, B. Van Herff, J. T. Wilson, Dr. W.\r\nP. Swett, H. P. Stebbins, J. A. Morriss, R. S. Marks, L. S. Johnson,\r\nC. C. Mitchell, John Huttonhomer, F. J. Folley, Rev. J. W. Johnston,\r\nMrs. L. A. Raymond, Mrs. Louisa Young, P. Pond, Fred Dixon and others.\r\nThere were shipped from this point last season 150 tons, being the\r\nfirst bearing year of the oldest vineyards of much size. The bearing\r\nvineyards and orchards the coming season will more than double the\r\nshipments, and in two years all the vineyard trees mentioned will come\r\nto bearing.\r\n\r\nThe prices in Washington and New York last July were six and seven\r\ncents per pound for black grapes, and thirteen and fourteen cents per\r\npound for Delaware and Niagara, and $3.50 to $4.50 per bushel crate for\r\npeaches and plums. The demand was as good at the close of the season as\r\nat first. Write to Dr. C. W. Weaver, S. N. Whipple, H. P. Bilyeu, C. D.\r\nTarbell, C. B. Mabore for prices obtained for their own shipments. Dr.\r\nWeaver realized from three acres of his best Delaware grapes $150 per\r\nacre net.\r\n\r\nI have thus, in a rambling way, given your readers an idea of the\r\nclimate and agricultural resources of the sand hills of Moore county,\r\nN. C.\r\n\r\nSouthern Pines is a town eight years old, in the midst of the\r\nturpentine region of North Carolina, sixty-eight miles southwest from\r\nRaleigh, on the Raleigh & Augusta Railroad (part of the Seaboard Air\r\nLine), fifteen hours from New York, and is six hundred feet above sea\r\nlevel, the highest point in the whole turpentine belt. The soil is a\r\nsandy loam and has a perfect drainage. Malaria is unknown. The presence\r\nof the long-leafed pine in large quantities causes the generation of\r\nozone to such a degree as to make this locality almost a specific for\r\nthroat and lung difficulties. Many physicians and a large number of\r\nthe cured and benefited testify to its wonderful effects. The town\r\nis filled mainly with Northern people, and has four hotels, a good\r\nschool, and church services every Sabbath. There are three stores, and\r\nrailroad, telegraph and express offices. There are many fine residences\r\nand a large hotel 300 feet long and four stories is being built with\r\nmodern improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit-Growing in Texas.\r\n\r\nR. T. WHEELER, Hitchcock, Galveston county, Texas.--I have examined\r\nand am very much pleased with your magazine, and particularly the\r\ndepartment of agricultural correspondence. This is an exceedingly\r\ninteresting and important feature, well calculated to accomplish much\r\nin the settlement and development of the South. Your journal has a high\r\nmission and is on the right road.\r\n\r\nUnlike most of your correspondents I am a native of this State, and\r\na lifetime resident of this section, and therefore naturally biased\r\nin favor of this country, climate and people, free, however, from\r\nany prejudice against any other portion of the country. While I am\r\nnot in the strict sense a farmer, and have no skilled acquaintance\r\nwith any branch of horticulture or agriculture, I have had ten years’\r\npractical acquaintance with the cultivation of this soil, and my ten\r\nyears’ residence at this station, fourteen miles from Galveston City,\r\nhas given me the opportunity of observing its rapid progress and\r\ndevelopment within the past five or six years, from a purely stock\r\ncountry, a naked prairie, in which lands were worth not exceeding fifty\r\ncents per acre, devoted exclusively to raising ordinary Texas cattle,\r\nit requiring at a low estimate ten acres to support one cow of the\r\nvalue of about $6, to a prosperous and independent fruit and truck\r\nfarming community, having over 150,000 pear trees set to orchard, over\r\n100 acres in strawberries now ripening and ready for market, yielding\r\nfrom $300 to $600 per acre; some 300 acres more in cultivation in\r\ngeneral vegetables, a church, good public schools, with an average\r\nattendance of over fifty scholars daily, good stores, about twenty\r\nartesian wells flowing good, pure, wholesome water in the greatest\r\nabundance, from a depth of about 600 feet, nurseries and rose gardens\r\nwith several hundred varieties of roses now in full bloom in the open\r\nair, without a poor man or woman, and not one that is not making a good\r\nliving, a community whose reputation is co-extensive with horticulture\r\nwithin the States and Canada, whose products are well-known in Chicago\r\nand other markets, and whose strawberries have sold as far West as Salt\r\nLake City.\r\n\r\nVery much of the wonderful development of this country is due Col. H.\r\nM. Stringfellow, who some nine years since introduced the Le Conte and\r\nKiefer pears, and whose orchard, in the language of an ex-governor\r\nof Texas, is “simply a world-beater.” Last year, as we all know, was\r\nboth a drouth and a panic year, and yet on his thirteen-acre orchard\r\nMr. Stringfellow cleared considerably over $5000 on pear fruit alone,\r\nand much more on the sale of rooted pear cuttings, these pears being\r\npropagated by cuttings. I could write a book about this country and\r\nthen be in the same trouble as the Queen of Sheba, but I fear that this\r\nletter is beyond reasonable length. Notwithstanding this extraordinary\r\ndevelopment, lands are still comparatively cheap; the best can be had\r\nfrom $20 to $50 per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Opinion of Arkansas After Three Years’ Trial.\r\n\r\nJ. M. SOWLE, Dryden, Ark.--I came here from Michigan in June, 1890.\r\nLocated at a place now called Dryden, just west of Gilkerson on the St.\r\nLouis Southwestern Railway, with seventeen families and a few single\r\nmen; seventy in all. The B. & S. W. Railroad now runs through our town.\r\n\r\nTwo families returned to stay; three more got lonesome here in the\r\nwoods and went back expecting to stay, and before they were back two\r\nmonths acknowledged that they were homesick to come back and did come\r\nback, as they liked the society here, as well as the fine weather and\r\ngood health. Everyone here now are here to stay, and most of them have\r\nbought land.\r\n\r\nWe have such nice warm sunshine and weather in the winter. Health best\r\nof any place we were ever located. Out of the seventy people in the\r\nthree years and eight months, have had eight persons sick enough to\r\ngo to bed. One two-year-old girl died; another three-months-old babe\r\ndied; she was well at midnight, found dead in bed in the morning; and\r\none woman fifty years old died with consumption, think hereditary, as\r\nher father, mother and five brothers and sisters died with the same\r\ndisease. The three who died are counted in the eight sick, except the\r\nbabe.\r\n\r\nThe soil here is good and never fails to raise crops on account of\r\ndrouth or any other cause. We have raised fifty bushels shelled corn to\r\nthe acre on our poorest land, and a bushel of potatoes to twenty-four\r\nhills, and in fact nearly all kind of crops are extra good. The county\r\nis naturally suited to peaches, plums and grapes. General good crops\r\nare corn, cotton, wheat, oats, timothy, clover, red top, blue grass,\r\nblackberries, raspberries, apples, pears and quince.\r\n\r\nSociety is good; more church members in proportion to population than\r\nany place I ever was in. Laws are enforced here better than any place I\r\never lived.\r\n\r\nThis county is a peaceful and safe county to live in, as we have the\r\nbest of accommodating neighbors, as well as law-abiding citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nA General Answer to Many Letters of Inquiry.\r\n\r\nA. K. FISHER, Abbeville, Ga.--My letter published some time ago in your\r\nmagazine brought me so many letters of inquiry concerning this section,\r\nour mode of farming, cost of getting land ready for cultivation, etc.,\r\nthat it required a long letter to each, and I have been unable to\r\ncomply. I write this letter now to cover all the ground of inquiries.\r\n\r\nAbbeville has about 2000 inhabitants, is county seat of Wilcox county,\r\nGa., is on the Savannah, Americus & Montgomery Railroad, sixty-five\r\nmiles east of Americus, where the railroad crosses the Ocmulgee river.\r\nThis river is navigable; Brunswick is near its mouth.\r\n\r\nAbbeville has two churches--Methodist and Baptist; Presbyterians also\r\nhave service there. Schools generally are not as good as in most of\r\nNorthern States, but are gradually improving; have some teachers from\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nHeretofore the products from this section have been lumber, spirits\r\nturpentine, rosin, cotton, some beef cattle and wool.\r\n\r\nA few years ago fortunes were made in a short time in lumber and\r\nturpentine business when properly managed, but most of the operators\r\nincreased their business, bought large tracts of land, borrowed money,\r\netc. Now the prices of those products have declined to or below cost of\r\nproduction, and for the past two years our banks have not been loaning\r\nmoney, so those parties are obliged to sacrifice their lands. Although\r\nthis section has been settling up rapidly, lands can be bought for less\r\nthan two years ago.\r\n\r\nIn past twenty years cotton has declined from twenty to seven cents per\r\npound. When cotton brought from fifteen to twenty cents per pound the\r\ncotton planter had all the money he required and raised nothing else\r\nfor market. As a class they spent their money freely; if more money\r\nwere required before the crop was made they could readily get advances\r\non cotton crop; now the staple is below cost of production, still many\r\nare obliged to grow cotton, as it is the only crop on which they can\r\nget advances. To change requires an expenditure for farming implements\r\nand machinery for putting in and harvesting the crop, stumps are to be\r\ngotten out of the way, etc. To grow fruit requires several years to\r\nrealize. Most of the planters own large tracts of land, and are anxious\r\nto dispose of a part; some are hoping each year the acreage in cotton\r\nwill be reduced (by many putting their lands in other crops), thereby\r\nenhancing the price of cotton and they be benefited. They prefer to\r\ngrow cotton, having never done anything else. Some who tried hay failed\r\non first trial, as they did not have proper implements, and they\r\nexposed it to dews and rain after it was cured or partly so.\r\n\r\nThe timber in this locality is long leaf pine, excepting along the\r\nriver, where is abundance of hardwoods, viz: different varieties oak,\r\nhickory, ash, gum, cypress and some elm. The pines are not thick on the\r\nland; the principal roots go straight down; the surface soil is sandy,\r\nintermixed with dark pebbles and clay subsoil. The mode of clearing\r\nland is to deaden by girdling the trees, burn the logs and trash on the\r\nground, fence and put in the plough. To one not accustomed to it, this\r\nlooks very slovenly, but I believe it is the best plan, as in a few\r\nyears the trees rot and fall to the ground. The trees are no more in\r\nthe way than the stumps; the dead hearts can much more readily be split\r\ninto rails or burned than when green. The heart rails will last fifteen\r\nyears; it costs about $10.00 per thousand to put rails into fences;\r\nrails are ten feet long. I am building board fences; lumber costs me\r\nat mill $5.00 per thousand feet. There are plenty of mills. I have my\r\nposts split from dead hearts and faced with axe; they cost me about\r\nthree cents each at fence. When the ground is wet a man can dig seventy\r\nholes in a day; when dry the clay subsoil becomes very hard and one\r\nhalf above number would be good work.\r\n\r\nI have taken stumps from 200 acres land at a cost of about $2.00 per\r\nacre; generally would cost from $2.00 to $6.00 per acre, according to\r\nlength of time land had been cleared. I have not tried dynamite; some\r\nhave, but cannot state whether it gave satisfactory results; I believe\r\nit would, especially in new land. We plant our corn in rows, generally\r\nsix feet apart and from two to three feet apart in a row, one stalk in\r\na place. At last working of corn we put in one or two rows of peas to\r\nevery row of corn; the peas and corn mature at same time. When corn is\r\ngathered we gather peas enough for seed, then put in the hogs and they\r\nfatten from the peas. Some varieties of those peas will remain on the\r\nground all winter and grow the next summer. The pea crop is worth as\r\nmuch as the corn crop.\r\n\r\nCorn grown here is worth seventy cents per bushel. From sixty acres\r\nI got over 1200 bushels of corn. I used on the sixty acres two tons\r\nof phosphate that cost here $16.00 per ton mixed with the manure from\r\nfour mules and 200 bushels cottonseed worth fifteen cents per bushel.\r\nSome make more, some less, according to cultivation and amount of\r\nfertilizers used. One of my neighbors for several years past has been\r\nmaking forty bushels of corn to the acre.\r\n\r\nFrom 100 acres in oats I got 2000 bushels; these are rust proof and\r\nalways in demand for seed; I sold all for sixty cents per bushel. I\r\nused no fertilizers under the oats; I generally cut two crops of hay\r\nsame season from same land after I cut my oats. I plough, harrow and\r\nroll the ground in June. I use under the hay guano worth about $6.00\r\nto every acre and get two tons of hay per acre worth here $18.00 per\r\nton. This grass comes spontaneously after the land is cultivated a\r\nfew years and makes excellent hay. It does not grow North. This year\r\none of my neighbors cut from twelve acres 600 bushels of oats; put\r\nno fertilizers under the oats, but had the year previous oats on same\r\nland, and after the oats were cut, in June, he planted it in peas;\r\nwhen the peas matured he turned his hogs in; by October the hogs had\r\ngathered the peas, then he ploughed under the pea vines and sowed in\r\nthe oats. This is the most economical way of improving our lands. The\r\ncrop of peas pays for all the expense. We feed but little corn to our\r\nhogs.\r\n\r\nWheat is grown but little in this section. When cotton was worth twenty\r\ncents per pound no one would raise wheat, so the mills were either\r\ntorn or rotted down, but in a short time there will be a mill to grind\r\nwheat in the vicinity. There are plenty of mills to grind corn. Nearly\r\nall the vegetables grown North do well here, and come into the market\r\nmuch earlier, and many that do not grow there do well here. Cabbage and\r\nIrish potatoes do well here, but when planted in spring mature early in\r\nsummer and do not keep longer than a couple of months; when planted in\r\nJuly they mature in fall and keep tolerably well, but sometimes it is\r\ndifficult to get a stand of plants in July.\r\n\r\nThis is about 32° north latitude; peaches, pears, plums, grapes and\r\nsome varieties of apples do well here, and all begin bearing at much\r\nyounger age than North; perhaps are not as long-lived, but heretofore\r\nno care has been taken of them.\r\n\r\nIn the woods the grass grows during summer from one to one and one-half\r\nfeet high, and makes a splendid pasture, especially for six months,\r\ncommencing in April. The cattle, sheep and hogs are never fed. At this\r\ntime of the year all are poor, but in May both cattle and sheep are in\r\ngood order. By having some winter pastures to keep the cattle fat for\r\nwinter market the beeves would bring fancy prices in the home market.\r\nThere is plenty of good beef here in summer; in winter our beef comes\r\nfrom the West (cold storage) and costs by the quarter eight cents per\r\npound.\r\n\r\nWe sow oats from September to February; I pasture mine some in winter,\r\nbut there are a number of grasses that make here a good winter\r\npasture. Alfalfa is being grown with success in some portions of this\r\nState; no doubt would do well here. These cattle, sheep and hogs on\r\nthe range have never been improved by crossing with improved breeds;\r\nthe rule has been to leave every tenth male for breeding purposes. By\r\ncrossing the native ewes with some of the improved breeds, and feeding\r\nsome on pasturing in winter, lambs could be put into Northern markets\r\nmuch earlier than from the States farther North. These cattle and sheep\r\nare all gotten up at a certain time for shearing and marking, when\r\nthose for market are sold to buyers who ship them to the cities to sell\r\nto butchers. Some of the stock is never seen by the owners. The young\r\nare marked with the mark of its mother, the fleece of wool tied up and\r\nmarked, the owner notified, he pays for sheering and gets it. All land\r\nnot fenced is range and free to all. One might own 1000 head of cattle\r\nand not own an acre of land. Hogs live and grow on range but do much\r\nbetter when fed some; those near river get fat from acorns.\r\n\r\nBuilding material is cheap. Kiln-dried and dressed flooring and ceiling\r\nfrom $8.00 to $12.00 per M feet; No. 1 Brick at kiln $5.00 per M.\r\n\r\nButter is worth thirty cents per pound, eggs fifteen cents per dozen,\r\nsweet milk ten cents per quart, buttermilk five cents per quart.\r\n\r\nA number of parties from Ohio came to this section last February; some\r\nbought when they came, others bought this winter; all remained. They\r\nsay they do not feel the heat any more than in Ohio, as we have more\r\nbreeze and the nights are pleasant. Sunstrokes are unknown. A few\r\ndays ago a party from Ohio bought 300 acres of land one and one-half\r\nmiles from Abbeville, thirty acres of which is cleared, all salable\r\ntimber cut from the balance, but enough for farm purposes on the land;\r\nbuildings worth $150; no orchard; 250 acres fair pine lands, fifty\r\nacres of but little value, price paid $1600; $1150 cash, $450 in twelve\r\nmonths. The buyer intends going into the dairy business; also fruit\r\nand improved stock. Lands can be bought at from $2.00 to $10.00 per\r\nacre, according to distance from railway, improvements, etc., and my\r\nexperience is a better profit can be made farming from an acre here\r\nthan from an acre in the Northern States, where their lands are valued\r\nat from $50.00 to $75.00 per acre. Taxes are about fifty cents on\r\nvalues of $100. Near rivers, ponds, etc., are subject to some fevers. I\r\nhave lived here for past twelve years; have not had case of fever among\r\nmy family or hands on the place.\r\n\r\nWe have no sand flies nor mosquitoes, except near ponds and water\r\ncourses there are mosquitoes. We are not subject to tornadoes or\r\ncyclones as in some parts of the West. Our labor is mixed, mostly\r\nnegroes. Farm hands are paid from $8.00 to $12.00 per month and\r\nrations. A ration consists of four pounds of bacon and one peck meal\r\nfor six day’s work. Where it is white labor they are boarded in the\r\nfamily of the farmers. The negroes here are strong competitors in many\r\nof the trades, especially carpenters, blacksmiths and painters; also\r\nmasons. Our climate is so mild that it is not necessary for comfort\r\nfor a house to be plastered or ceiled inside; very few farmers’ houses\r\nare; neither is so expensive clothing required as in the North. On\r\nthe nights of the fifth and sixth instant we had very little ice on\r\nshallow water on the ground; those were the coldest nights this winter.\r\nI have seen snow a few times in last twelve years; have seen none this\r\nwinter. Ploughs can run all winter. A few peach trees are in bloom now\r\n(February 14th). There are no government or State land to homestead or\r\nfor sale in this State, but plenty of lands for sale either unimproved\r\nor improved. We cultivate too much land here; we should cultivate less\r\nand work and fertilize better.\r\n\r\nThe people are anxious for Northern farmers to come and settle here\r\nand will render home seekers any service in their power, furnish them\r\nstock to ride or drive and take care of them whilst they are procuring\r\nlocations, etc. I would not advise anyone without some capital to come;\r\nanyone coming should come with the expectation of working for himself\r\nand not for others. I notice that the Big Four and St. Louis Railway\r\nare selling round-trip tickets to points in Georgia, good for twenty\r\ndays, for one fare. These tickets are issued for March 8th and April\r\n9th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITEMS ABOUT FARMS AND FARMERS\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall Farms In Florida.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that farmers of the North will purchase land for\r\nfarming purposes at $100 or more per acre when in the South there is an\r\nabundance of land at from $5 to $25 an acre, from which, acre for acre,\r\na larger revenue can be derived. Because of the variety of products\r\nraised in the North no farm of less than forty acres is regarded as\r\nsufficiently large to maintain a family.\r\n\r\nThe tendency in the North is towards larger farms, and many farmers are\r\nnot satisfied with a farm of less than 160 acres. Make the acreage only\r\nforty, and the farm is worth $4000. On twenty acres of land in Florida\r\nthat can be bought at $25 per acre, one can get a larger annual return\r\nin dollars than he can from the $4000 farm in the North.\r\n\r\nThis statement needs no proof. It is being demonstrated year by year\r\nall over the State, and only needs to be understood by the great army\r\nof home-seekers of the country to bring such an influx of them as\r\nwill make Florida one of the most populous portions of the country.\r\nThousands of people in the North want just such homes as are within\r\ntheir reach here. They have not money enough to pay for a satisfactory\r\nhome at the high prices of the North, but they possess enough property\r\nto be able to secure a good home in Florida. If they could only be\r\nenlightened as to what awaits them here, they would come in force.--The\r\nCitizen, Jacksonville, Fla.\r\n\r\n\r\nImproved Methods of the Southern Farmer.\r\n\r\nThe Savannah Morning News sees cause for favorable comment in the\r\nimproved methods of the Southern farmer. It says: “Contrasted with\r\nthe average Southern farm of fifteen years ago, the average Southern\r\nfarm of today presents a striking object lesson of the New South’s\r\nprogress. Plows, hoes and other agricultural implements are no longer\r\nleft in the fields, or without shelter in the barnyards, overnight,\r\nor for weeks at a time, according to the whim of the user. Wagons and\r\ncarts are not left standing, covered with mud, at the most convenient\r\nplace to drop them. Harnesses are not thrown on a fence, or a peg, or\r\na hitching post, exposed to the weather, until wanted. These things\r\nnow have their orderly places under shelter and are properly looked\r\nafter. Rainy days are no longer spent in loafing about the kitchen, but\r\nemployer and hired man put in the time of the rainy day in the barn\r\nmending harness, oiling machinery, tightening wagon bolts, etc.”\r\n\r\nAll of this goes to show thrift and economy, and partly explains why\r\nmany a Georgia farmer has surplus funds to loan at interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition of Georgia Farmers.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Georgia State Agricultural Society, held at\r\nBrunswick, Ga., February 14, Col. Waddell, the president of the\r\nsociety, said, in an address:\r\n\r\n“The condition of the farmers of Georgia is not really understood. The\r\nview entertained by the optimist being too rosy, that of the pessimist\r\ntoo depressing. They are nearer out of debt than they have ever been,\r\nthey have more home-raised supplies than for many years, and they\r\nare managing their affairs with more judgment and prudence than ever\r\nbefore. But they experienced the pinching scarcity of money, and some\r\nof them are burdened with debts which would have been cancelled but\r\nfor the shrinkage in the value of their lands and the products of\r\ntheir farms. You who are practical farmers know there is no money in\r\nraising cotton at seven or eight cents a pound, and that our only hope\r\nof success is in producing every possible article of necessity at home.\r\nFortunately, we are not dependent on the cotton crop, for in variety\r\nand diversity of products, and in soil and climate, Georgia produces\r\nunequalled advantages, and these advantages are being recognized and\r\nutilized more and more every year.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTexas Tobacco Growers Organize.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco growers have formed an association for mutual benefit\r\nand for the promotion of this branch of crop cultivation. It is to\r\nbe called the Cigar Leaf Tobacco Growers’ Association, and intends\r\npublishing a paper in the interests of Texas tobacco.\r\n\r\nO. A. Smith, of Willis, is president; H. F. Malone, of Willis,\r\nvice-president, and J. F. Irvine, secretary and treasurer. The\r\nexecutive committee is composed of the following: Clark Arnold, of\r\nGalveston; J. M. Buckley, of Willis; T. G. Wools, of Hondo; J. H.\r\nBruning, of Galveston; J. J. Strozier, of Willis; C. F. Rhode, of\r\nGalveston; O. A. Smith, of Willis, and H. S. Elders, of Willis.\r\n\r\nThe by-laws of the National Tobacco Growers’ Association, as adopted at\r\nWashington, are adopted by this association.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfitable Rice Culture.\r\n\r\nThe New York Journal of Commerce, in an article on rice growing in\r\nSouthwestern Louisiana, says: A couple of years ago the crop was\r\nexcessive, but the last crop is well sold up, and there is little doubt\r\nthat the consumption of rice will vastly increase in this country.\r\nScientifically and practically it is one of the best of foods, and the\r\ntaste for it is growing. Portions of this section of Louisiana are\r\nsufficiently watered by natural overflow, but a good deal of it is\r\nartificially irrigated. Some of the farmers say that it is a little\r\nmore work to cultivate rice than wheat or corn, but most of them think\r\nit is less; there is no great difference in the cost. The general\r\ntestimony is that it costs $5 or $6 an acre to cultivate it, exclusive\r\nof irrigation, which, as already said, is not always necessary. A\r\ndollar for seed, two for cultivation and two for harvesting is the\r\nestimate of many farmers, though a few put the cost at a dollar or\r\ntwo more, and some go as high as $10 or $12. Ten barrels in the rough\r\nis regarded by many cultivators as a fair average crop, but yields of\r\ntwelve and fifteen barrels are common. The farmers generally get from\r\n$2 to $3 a barrel, and sometimes a little more. A rice cultivator at\r\nLake Author, La., writes: “I can say honestly and positively that a man\r\ncan make a big fortune in four or five years raising rice.... I know a\r\nnumber of farmers that have for the past three years averaged fifteen\r\nbarrels per acre, and their net average price per barrel for the three\r\nyears was $2.85.” These figures give gross receipts of $42.75 per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit Growing in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nAt the recent annual meeting of the Louisiana State Agricultural\r\nSociety, F. H. Burnette, the horticulturist of the State Experiment\r\nStation at Baton Rouge, read an interesting paper upon Southern fruits.\r\n\r\nProf. Burnette has given much time to the development of the fruit\r\nindustry of Louisiana, experimenting upon the different varieties of\r\nfruit indigenous to the climate, utilizing his knowledge of foreign\r\nhorticulturing and experimenting at the station. He gave a full report\r\nof these experiments. The paper was of especial interest to small fruit\r\ngrowers, dwelling upon the varieties of peach, pear and orange which\r\ncan be grown with success in Louisiana, and of the new variety of\r\nJapanese and Chinese plums and persimmons which he has grown at Baton\r\nRouge with success.\r\n\r\nAt the same meeting Judge Lewis, of Opelousas, spoke of the cultivation\r\nof figs as a marketable crop and one which has never failed of\r\nproducing remunerative results by close attention to the cultivation\r\nof the trees. He also spoke of the preserves made in Opelousas of the\r\nrind of the sour orange and also of figs, which are sold in the stores\r\nof Opelousas. The fig tree is self-supporting, and as an orchard which\r\nproduces and supplies itself, being free from climatic influences.\r\nHe spoke at length upon the possibilities of canning the fruits of\r\nLouisiana and shipping them to Northern markets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe farmers of Sumter county, Georgia, the county in which Americus\r\nis located, are more and more abandoning the all cotton business and\r\nturning to the growing of fruits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. J.

Its purpose is to aid the farmers of the\r\nState by experiments in the preparation, fertilization and cultivation\r\nof the soil, etc. It is maintained by an annual appropriation of\r\n$15,000 by the United States government. The property used for the\r\npurposes of the station belongs to the State. This property consists of\r\n130 acres of land with buildings, including dairy, ginnery, greenhouse,\r\ntobacco barn, laboratory, etc.\r\n\r\nA bulletin of results is published once a quarter and is sent free to\r\nany citizen of Georgia engaged in any branch of farming. The station is\r\nlocated at Experiment, near Griffin. Its organization is as follows: R.\r\nJ. Redding, director; H. C. White, Ph. D., vice-director and chemist;\r\nH. N. Starnes, horticulturist; James M. Kimbrough, Agriculturist; H.

The honey brought twelve and a half cents and the\r\nwax seventeen and a half cents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA recent bulletin issued from the Texas Experimental Station gives some\r\ninteresting comparisons of the four leading crops in the State. The\r\ncotton crop of Texas covers 4,520,310 acres, and is worth $69,439,476;\r\nthe corn crop covers 3,166,353 acres and is worth $28,429,125; the\r\nwheat crop covers 442,337 acres and is worth $5,244,303; the sweet\r\npotato crop covers 29,928 acres and is worth $1,503,764. According\r\nto the above statistics the value of each crop per acre is: Cotton,\r\n$15.36; corn, $8.94; wheat, $11.88; sweet potatoes, $50.24. The cost of\r\ngrowing an acre of either is not materially different. Here is a big\r\ndifference in favor of sweet potatoes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Jere Mabry, of Belton, Texas, reports as the result of his work\r\nfor 1893, on a rented farm of eighty acres, cash receipts aggregating\r\n$1,974.91. Besides what he sold he raised, for the most part his food\r\nsupplies. His total cash expenses were $506.85, leaving $964.06 as the\r\nnet cash profit of the year’s work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn intelligent farmer of Rowan county, N.

There is no necessity for the cry of hard times\r\namong the farmers of Rowan. True, they have little money, but they do\r\nnot need it, they have all at home that they can consume. Why, many of\r\nthe farmers are raising everything they need on the farm. I know of men\r\nwho now have plenty of meat who a few years ago did not raise a hog, so\r\nyou see they are growing wiser and are prospering as all good farmers\r\nshould. True, a few of Rowan’s farms are mortgaged and badly in debt,\r\nbut they are generally of that sort that lounge around town in idleness\r\nthe greater portion of the time and let their crops go, trusting to a\r\nmortgage for the next year.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “Southern Pines Orchard Co.” purchased in 1890 1200 acres of wooded\r\nland near Southern Pines, and 360 acres of this has been cleared and\r\nplanted as follows: 51,000 peach trees, 5000 pears, 1000 plums, 16,000\r\nblackberry. In that section the peach crop never fails. Last year\r\nthe new trees bore a few peaches and this year they are expected to\r\nbear freely. The president of the company is Mr. J.

Not\r\nnear so much fertilizer is being used as in previous years, and the\r\nfarmers of Macon county, Ga., are reported by the Macon News to be\r\nin better condition than in a long time.

I will reply as I have done to\r\nmy friend Mr. Clark Howell, of Atlanta, Ga., for the columns of his\r\npaper, from the stand-point of a business man and farmer, and not in\r\nmy relation to the party who recently visited the seaboard States,\r\ncomposed in the main of medical editors, their wives and friends.\r\n\r\nToo much praise cannot be awarded Dr. W. C. Wile, of Danbury, Conn.,\r\nfor promoting and organizing the party of Northern medical editors and\r\ntheir friends, thus bringing to their attention the unusual advantages\r\nof the Piedmont section of the Southern seaboard States to Northern\r\nemigration.\r\n\r\nThese distinguished gentlemen will shortly communicate their views\r\nthrough their respective journals, but what I shall say now will be\r\nquite free from all professional considerations.\r\n\r\nEither North Carolina or Georgia must be regarded as the paradise\r\nof the fruit grower. I have had a large experience in vine growing\r\nand wine making in Western New York, having planted one of the first\r\nvineyards on the shores of Lake Keuka, and being one of the promoters\r\nof the Urbana Wine Co., and I am familiar in a practical way with that\r\nmost remunerative culture of the black raspberry, in Yates county, New\r\nYork, which furnishes the evaporated dried fruit so much now in demand,\r\nand may fairly be classed as one qualified to speak, in a practical\r\nway, as to the general features of fruit growing. The wine-growing\r\nindustry, yet in its infancy in North Carolina, has gone far enough\r\nto demonstrate an assured success in a lucrative way, to those who\r\ncarry on its productions on business methods. The experiments made at\r\nSouthern Pines, N. C., have gone far enough to leave no manner of doubt\r\nof splendid results in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with which the Northern grower has to contend are the\r\nhigh price of land and labor and the early frost. Labor in both Georgia\r\nand North Carolina is abundant and cheap. Eight dollars per month will\r\ncover the wages of men with rations, which can be computed at $2.50\r\nper month. Frost is quite out of the question. The cost of land in\r\ndesirable locations is as low as $3 to $10 per acre, and if unimproved\r\nland is taken a net of $10 would be ample to put good land ready to\r\nplant the vine. The plow can run in both the States every month in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nBy way of Norfolk, the markets of New York and Philadelphia are as\r\naccessible to the fruit growers of these States as to Western New York,\r\nin both time and rate. North Carolina seems to have been chary of the\r\nimmigration of foreigners. Of that great flood of European blood that\r\nhas for the past twenty-five years poured into the ports of New York,\r\nneither North Carolina nor Georgia has received anything worth naming.\r\nIt has swept like an enormous wave over the West, but not on the South\r\nAtlantic seaboard. You would secure those who are desirable and by\r\nproper work could do so.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Northern States do not correctly understand your\r\nsection. They should visit and carefully look into the capacities\r\nof your States. Nothing dispels illusions like contact and personal\r\nexamination. The North is full of active, energetic, industrious men\r\ninured to labor, who do not know what advantages you offer or they\r\nwould flood into and buy up your unoccupied lands and form a splendid\r\nfactor in the New South now forming. Would the Northern settlers be\r\nhospitably received? At the North this would be a controlling question.\r\nGeneral Manager Winder, of the Seaboard Air Line, assures me that in\r\nhis State the Northern settler would be most welcome. Ex-Governor\r\nJarvis, of North Carolina, in a recent conversation, assured me that\r\nthe Southern welcome would be whole-souled, full and free from the\r\nslightest danger of interference. I have equally high authority in\r\nGeorgia of a similar state of public sentiment. Northern settlers\r\nwould, strange as it may sound to you, need to be assured in these\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nThe present depressed state of financial affairs is not against such an\r\nimmigration now. Your splendid railways should give especial facilities\r\nin reduced freights to actual settlers. Austin Corbin, one of our\r\ngreatest railroad workers, transports free over his railways every\r\npound of material an actual settler puts on his land in improvements.\r\nI would advocate free transportation of the household goods of every\r\nactual Northern settler by your great railway lines.\r\n\r\nI do not dare to state what I think of the future of North Carolina\r\nand Georgia within the next fifty years. Yes, twenty-five years. No\r\nGeorgian or Carolinian would believe as much as I see coming in the\r\nnext generation. With a climate that not only rivals, but excels\r\nthat of Italy, I say to Georgians and North Carolinians if you will\r\nyourselves open to Northern eyes the enormous advantages of your grand\r\nStates, you will witness a spectacle within the next thirty years as\r\nmarvelous as that we saw in Atlanta, where a magnificent city has\r\narisen, phœnix-like, from the ashes made by Sherman’s army. And the new\r\nStates of Georgia and North Carolina will come into a new and grander\r\nlife, which will be as much a wonder to the next generation as Atlanta\r\nis to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN STATES.\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                           SOUTHERN STATES.\r\n\r\n                    AN ILLUSTRATED MONTHLY MAGAZINE\r\n                         DEVOTED TO THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n                           Published by the\r\n                 Manufacturers’ Record Publishing Co.\r\n                    Manufacturers’ Record Building,\r\n                            BALTIMORE, MD.\r\n\r\n             SUBSCRIPTION: $1.50 a Year; $1 for Six Months\r\n\r\n                          WILLIAM H.

It is quite\r\ntrue that the railroads should pursue the most liberal policy in\r\nfostering and developing immigration. Every farmer who settles in the\r\nterritory of any road becomes a permanent producer of traffic for that\r\nroad, and whether the railroad company be the owner of lands or not,\r\nthe most profitable expenditures it can make are such as will help to\r\npopulate and build up the country tributary to its lines. It is also\r\ntrue that every Southern State should have an immigration department\r\nor bureau, conducted not by small politicians, but by the most capable\r\nmen to be had, and not supported by niggardly appropriations, but amply\r\nsupplied with sufficient money to make possible the most progressive\r\nand comprehensive methods.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the ideal is not going to be reached as to either\r\nthe railroads or the States. Both will in the aggregate come very far\r\nshort of what ought to be done, and this will be more pronouncedly and\r\nlamentably true of the State governments.\r\n\r\nOutside of these agencies, then, how is the cause of immigration to be\r\nadvanced? The question and the conditions giving rise to it suggest\r\nan opportunity for capital and enterprise. In almost any part of the\r\nSouth very large areas of land may be gotten together at very low\r\nprices. With money enough to buy and properly develop farm lands, and\r\nwith judicious management, there is hardly any limit to the profitable\r\nbusiness that could be done by immigration or colonization companies.\r\nFor example, a company that could buy say 10,000 to 20,000 or more\r\nacres of land in a body, or make up this acreage by consolidating a\r\nnumber of farms bought from different owners, and then divide this up\r\ninto small farms of twenty, forty, eighty or more acres, construct\r\nroads throughout the entire area, drain the whole of it, put it all in\r\nthe best shape for the most advanced farming or gardening operations,\r\nbuilding houses, &c., and then direct themselves to the work of\r\ncolonizing it or selling to individual settlers, such a company, with\r\nsufficient capital and properly managed, could quickly settle up almost\r\nany area of land and make enormous profits for its stockholders.\r\nBesides the tracts sold as small farms, there would necessarily be one\r\nor more centrally located village sites which would become immediately\r\nvaluable as town property. There is nothing easier than getting\r\nNorthern farmers to go South. The conditions of farming and of life at\r\nthe South are so incomparably superior to those at the North that they\r\nneed only to be pressed upon the attention of Northern farmers to be\r\navailed of. In its millions of acres of cheap lands the South has the\r\nadvantage of an entirely new and undeveloped country, and has with this\r\nall the advantages and comforts and attractions of an established and\r\nadvanced civilization. The South is in the main more healthful than any\r\nother part of the United States, its range of farm and garden products\r\nis greater, it offers better opportunities for profitable agriculture,\r\nand it is in all respects a section where life can be lived in greater\r\ncomfort than at the North. Convinced of these facts, hundreds of\r\nthousands of substantial and well-to-do farmers in other parts of the\r\ncountry would quickly move to the South. In fact, there is even now,\r\nall over the North and Northwest a disposition to go South. As was\r\nstated in a letter published in the January number of the SOUTHERN\r\nSTATES, “there are thousands who would move South if somebody would\r\nstart the ball rolling.” These are the conditions. Properly utilized,\r\nthey can be made to furnish a wide and rich field for some of the\r\nmillions now lying idle and non-productive in the financial centres.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Legislature and Immigration.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Virginia, in its very proper and commendable desire\r\nto promote immigration to the State, is discussing the enactment of\r\nsome extraordinary legislation. A bill now before the senate provides\r\nfor the appointment of a commissioner of immigration, who shall keep\r\non file in his office a description of any lands submitted to him by\r\nany owner or real-estate agent, and shall receive a commission of\r\nnot more than 5 per cent. upon the sale of any such lands in lieu of\r\nsalary. Evidently, to the mind of the author of this bill, the benefits\r\nof an increase in the population of the State terminate with the sale\r\nof lands, and are confined to owners of such lands. The narrowness of\r\na measure that would impose upon any one class of people the expense\r\nof an immigration department is manifest. The innumerable and widely\r\nramifying benefits resulting from judicious immigration effort are\r\nshared by everybody, and the expense should be borne by everybody.\r\n\r\nAside from this inequity, there are many objections to the plan of\r\ngiving the proposed commissioner an interest in the sale of lands. As\r\nan officer of the State he should be free from any possibility of bias\r\nas to any part of the State or any specific properties.\r\n\r\nLet a commissioner of immigration be appointed by all means, and let\r\nan adequate fund be set apart for the expenses of his department, but\r\nlet this come out of the receipts from taxes, and thus be equitably\r\napportioned among all classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorida’s Obligation to Mr. Disston.\r\n\r\nTo say that no other State owes as much to any one man as Florida owes\r\nto Hamilton Disston, of Philadelphia, is a comprehensive statement, but\r\nit is probably true. About fifteen years ago some Northern capitalists\r\nwere induced to consider the idea of building railroads in Florida.\r\nIt was found on investigation that the State could not grant any of\r\nits lands to railroad companies, since all the lands of the State were\r\ncovered by a general mortgage which had been made to secure the State\r\nbonds. Without this inducement nobody was willing to put a dollar into\r\nrailroad building in Florida, for the reason that the early returns\r\nfrom traffic could not be expected to be such as would justify it. In\r\nthis emergency Mr. Disston came to the rescue of the State. He bought\r\n4,000,000 acres of Florida land, paying for it enough to discharge the\r\nentire State debt, thereby releasing the lands owned by the State,\r\nand placing it in a position to make grants to railroads. Immediately\r\nfollowing this, contracts were made with New York capitalists,\r\nand Florida entered upon an era of railroad building and general\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nOf course it is beyond question that the enormous resources and\r\ncapabilities of Florida would in time have brought railroads, with the\r\ndevelopment that accompanies them, but it is also true that but for\r\nthis timely intervention and help from Mr. Disston, the beginning of\r\nthis period of growth and prosperity would have been delayed, possibly\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nFollowing this timely succor, Mr. Disston has now put the State under\r\nfurther obligation to him for one of the most stupendous and one of the\r\nmost successful works of general improvement ever undertaken in this\r\ncountry. As was briefly told in the February number of the SOUTHERN\r\nSTATES, he has reclaimed for the State many millions of acres of land\r\nthat but for his enterprise would have been permanently a waste. True,\r\nhe has himself reaped large rewards, as it is proper that he should\r\nhave done, but this does not lessen the benefits the State receives,\r\nand moreover, the risk has been all his own, since the only return\r\nthe State was to make to him for the millions of dollars spent in his\r\ndrainage works was a share of the lands reclaimed from overflow.\r\n\r\nThe value of the services that Mr. Disston has rendered Florida are\r\nbeyond estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Do It.\r\n\r\nThe News, of Birmingham, Ala., very correctly maintains that reduced\r\nrailroad rates will not accomplish much in the way of inducing\r\nimmigration, unless the measure be accompanied by liberal advertising.\r\nThe News says:\r\n\r\n    Ten good settlers can be brought down from the effects of good\r\n    advertising, without any half rates, where one can be brought\r\n    down from the mere effects of half rates, and as a rule those\r\n    who come solely on account of low rates never become settlers,\r\n    but combined, the two do good service, reaching the better\r\n    class.\r\n\r\nThe SOUTHERN STATES is the channel through which to reach the attention\r\nof the North and Northwest. It is the only Southern immigration\r\njournal; the only publication that can be looked to for information\r\nabout the soil, climate, agricultural capabilities, etc., of the whole\r\nSouth. It is alone in this field. There has never been a time when\r\nthere was such eagerness for facts about the South. From New England,\r\nthe Middle States, the West, and notably from the Northwest, requests\r\nfor sample copies and letters of inquiry about the South are pouring in\r\nupon us.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements in the SOUTHERN STATES will be read every month by many\r\nthousands of people all over the North and Northwest, who are eagerly\r\nseeking such information as will enable them to determine what part of\r\nthe South is most likely to suit them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Such Danger.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Herald, in an editorial on the work of the SOUTHERN STATES,\r\nsays: “The reports are extremely favorable in regard to richness\r\nand variety of crops, and the chief danger seems to be that the\r\nspeculators in Southern lands, as well as many of the railroads, hold\r\ntheir lands at such prices as to dissuade the poorer but industrious\r\nclass of immigrants from taking them up.” The danger apprehended by\r\nthe Herald does not at all exist. There are many millions of acres of\r\nthe best land in the South that can be had for prices that are merely\r\nnominal. The trouble is not that there is any fault to be found with\r\nthe land, but there are not people enough in the South to cultivate\r\nmore than a small part of the land, and the surplus is, therefore, in\r\na sense valueless, no matter how rich and productive it may be. There\r\nare a good many millions of acres of railroad land, and in some of\r\nthe States State land, that can be had for such prices and upon such\r\nterms as nobody can find fault with. And as to the private holdings of\r\nindividuals, there is too much land in every part of the South unused,\r\nand therefore too many owners anxious to sell a part of what they own,\r\nto make possible any speculative putting up of prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Reach Prospective Immigrants.\r\n\r\n    That North Carolina needs immigrants of the right kind is too\r\n    universally admitted to call for proof; and that all efforts\r\n    heretofore made in this direction have been practically\r\n    a failure seems also clear. It seems equally clear that\r\n    circulars, handbooks and the State press fail of their purpose\r\n    in this respect, because they never reach the class we desire\r\n    to influence.--The Gazette, Washington, N. C.\r\n\r\nThe Gazette is right. Many thousands of dollars are wasted in printing\r\nbooks and pamphlets that nobody ever reads. There is a way, however, to\r\nreach the class it is desired to influence. It can be done through the\r\nSOUTHERN STATES. The SOUTHERN STATES is a journal of information about\r\nthe South. It is engaged in the work of making known the resources in\r\nsoil, climate and agricultural capabilities, of the Southern States.\r\nAnd such is the desire for accurate and comprehensive information about\r\nthis section that although the magazine has been in existence only\r\na year it goes into every part of New England, the Middle States,\r\nthe West and the Northwest, and is read by thousands of farmers and\r\nbusiness men who are seeking to inform themselves as to the most\r\nattractive localities in the South.\r\n\r\nThe SOUTHERN STATES furnishes a channel through which to reach\r\neffectively the class of possible immigrants needed in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork of Southern Railroads in Promoting Immigration.\r\n\r\nIn the general and very proper demand for railroad aid to the cause\r\nof Southern immigration, it should not be forgotten that many of the\r\nSouthern roads have been for years giving conspicuous and liberal\r\nattention to this work. Through the efforts of such roads, for\r\nexample, as the Mobile & Ohio, the Illinois Central, the Baltimore &\r\nOhio, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern, the Missouri, Kansas &\r\nTexas, the St. Louis Southwestern and others, hundreds of thousands\r\nof substantial farmers, artisans and business men have been induced\r\nto move to the South, and all of those roads are constantly enlarging\r\ntheir immigration work. A notable instance of broad and progressive\r\nmanagement in furtherance of immigration is furnished by the Georgia\r\nSouthern & Florida road, whose methods were made the subject of an\r\narticle published in the January number of the SOUTHERN STATES.\r\n\r\nOther Southern roads are becoming roused on this subject. The Seaboard\r\nAir Line system, which has a management as progressive and liberal as\r\nany road in the country, is preparing to inaugurate a comprehensive\r\nimmigration policy, and the Richmond & Danville road is also adopting\r\nmeasures to induce Northern farmers to settle along its lines. The\r\nLouisville & Nashville and the Central Railroad of Georgia systems are\r\nalso taking advanced steps in the same direction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe introduction of artesian water in some of the Southern towns,\r\nnotably Albany and Brunswick, Ga., has revolutionized the health of\r\nthose places; the two localities named, which were formerly noted for\r\nthe prevalence of malarial and other disorders, being now equally noted\r\nas health resorts. The last Georgia town to enter the artesian well\r\nprocession is Quitman, Ga. The April number of the SOUTHERN STATES will\r\ncontain an exhaustive article by Mr. James R. Randall, on drinking\r\nwater. Mr. Randall has for many years been making investigations on\r\nthis subject, and his article will be a revelation, not only to the\r\ngeneral public, but to most physicians and hygienists as well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Augusta Chronicle, quoting the sage remark of a man who had amassed\r\nmuch wealth, who when asked how he had made his money, said that he\r\nalways bought when everybody wanted to sell, and sold when everybody\r\nwanted to buy, urges that the present is the time for people with money\r\nto make investments. Prices of every sort have reached a minimum, and\r\nin view of the assured early reaction and the inevitable rebound to\r\nvery high prices that will follow the long term of depression, this\r\nwould seem to be as the Chronicle suggests, the time to buy things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo sooner is Atlanta well under way with its great International\r\nExposition project for 1895 than Macon comes to the front with an\r\nexposition enterprise of its own.

I would\r\n    advocate free transportation of the household goods of every\r\n    actual Northern settler by your great railway lines.”\r\n\r\nThis is commended to the attention of Southern railroad managers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Virginia seems to have some spite against real\r\nestate agents.

Patrick, of Southern Pines, N. C., secretary of the\r\nSouthern Bureau of Information, deserves much commendation for his\r\nenterprise and public spirit in having arranged for an excursion\r\nthrough the South of the editors of a number of leading Northern\r\nmedical journals. This undertaking of Mr. Patrick’s is in furtherance\r\nof an effort to correct the impression that still exists in the minds\r\nof a great many Northern people that the South is an unhealthful\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting of the Commercial & Industrial association, of\r\nMontgomery, Ala., the president said in his monthly report: “The\r\nassociation should advertise the city and hold forth its advantages in\r\nevery way possible which will attract capital and cause enterprising\r\ncitizens to locate here. A new era of growth and enterprise will come\r\napace and Montgomery should be prepared to reap the rewards that\r\nflow from it.” This admonishment may be heeded with profit by every\r\ncommunity in the South.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Clark Bell, the writer of the article on the fruit growing\r\npossibilities of the South Atlantic seaboard, is a New York lawyer,\r\nand editor of the Medico-Legal journal of New York. He has had a quite\r\nextensive practical experience in fruit growing, and his judgment as to\r\nthe capabilities of the South for this branch of agriculture is that of\r\na competent expert. Mr. Bell was one of the party of editors of medical\r\njournals who recently made a tour of the South Atlantic States under\r\nthe auspices of the Southern Bureau of Information, located at Southern\r\nPines, N. C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seems incomprehensible to a Southern man that there should be any\r\ndoubt in the minds of Northern people as to whether Northern settlers\r\nwill be well received in the South or not. Mr. Clark Bell, in an\r\narticle in this number, says: “Northern settlers would, strange as it\r\nmay sound to you, need to be assured in these respects,” and he thinks\r\nit necessary to quote the assurances on this point that he had from\r\ndistinguished Southern gentlemen. Not only will Northern farmers and\r\nbusiness men be well received in the South, but they will find awaiting\r\nthem a most eager welcome. The newspaper utterances all over the South,\r\nthe statements of public men, the personal letters to the newspapers\r\nfrom farmers and merchants, the actions of commercial bodies, indicate\r\nnot only a welcome to the Northern settler, but a keen appreciation of\r\nthe value to the South of immigration from the North, and a most eager\r\ndesire for this immigration. No Northern man, who is respectable enough\r\nto have standing in his own community at home, need have any fear but\r\nthat he will find in the South the utmost consideration and good will.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe superior train service on the Chesapeake & Ohio is well known to\r\nall patrons of that system. During the month of January train No. 1\r\nmade the run between Washington, D. C., and Cincinnati, twenty-nine\r\ndays, exactly on time, and on the other two days lost but twenty\r\nminutes. Train No. 2 made every trip between the cities on time, and\r\nthe “Fast Flying Virginian,” one of the finest express trains in the\r\ncountry, reached Cincinnati thirty out of thirty-one trips on time,\r\nalthough it was an hour late out of Washington on seven trips, caused\r\nby waiting for connections. This is a month’s record that the operating\r\ndepartment can be proud of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmigration News.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yazoo Delta.\r\n\r\nThe assistant land commissioner of the Illinois Central Railroad, Major\r\nG. W. McGinnis, in a recent interview on the subject of immigration to\r\nthe Yazoo Delta, spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“I believe that the time has now come for the introduction of white\r\nlabor. Our road, besides having agents all over the Northwest, have men\r\nin Germany and also in Holland, gathering families together to settle\r\nup our land. There are many residents of Dakota and other Northwestern\r\nStates who want a milder and a better climate, with a soil more fertile\r\nthan that of the Northwest. All these advantages are possessed by the\r\nDelta.\r\n\r\n“The greatest interest is manifested in the movement. Scarcely a day\r\npasses but what we receive from fifty to seventy-five letters of\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n“The colonists who have already taken advantage of our offers and\r\nsettled along the Delta, are making money hand over fist. They are\r\nraising cotton, corn, vegetables, stock and fruit. The largest peaches\r\nI ever saw in my life came from the Delta.\r\n\r\n“When our work is done we will see every man his own landlord, and by\r\nthe way, these foreigners are apt to steer clear of that condition, so\r\nprevalent in the South, of being land poor. They want no more land than\r\nthey can cultivate with the aid of their families, say forty acres. In\r\nfact, some of them buy no more than twenty. They make up the greatest\r\npopulation for agricultural districts possible to imagine. They have\r\nmade the Northwest what it is.\r\n\r\n“When the movement is once fairly started there will be no stopping the\r\nrush of immigration. Northern people all move in bodies. When one comes\r\nall come.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAlabama Farmers Invite Settlers From the North.\r\n\r\nThe following resolutions were adopted at a meeting of the State\r\nAgricultural Society of Alabama, held at Birmingham, February 23:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, By the State Agricultural Society of Alabama, that we\r\ninvite to Alabama all honest and industrious farmers that should be\r\ndesirous of changing their home, and extend to them a cordial welcome,\r\nassuring them that the right hand of fellowship will be extended to\r\nthem, and that feeling that is always accorded one good citizen from\r\nanother will be extended to them by the farmers of the State.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_ (2), That we will cordially indorse and sustain our\r\nhonorable commissioner of agriculture and his excellency, the governor\r\nof Alabama, in a vigorous and continuous effort for immigration made\r\nthrough the Department of Agriculture under existing law. At the same\r\nmeeting, Mr. Chappell Cory, editor of the Birmingham Age-Herald, read\r\nby invitation a paper in advocacy of efforts to induce immigration from\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Railroads and Immigration.\r\n\r\nThe organization of land companies for the purpose of inducing\r\nimmigration to West Tennessee is most commendable, especially when\r\nthese companies are conducted upon the plan of that one which proposes\r\nto open up the territory along the line of the Paducah, Tennessee &\r\nAlabama railroad. The capital of the company is very small, and there\r\nis little profit in the enterprise for those who have formed the\r\ncompany. They intend merely to direct the attention of immigrants to\r\nthe advantages which this heaven-blest region holds for the thrifty\r\nand hard-working farmer. The road is a new one, but it runs through a\r\nmost fertile region, especially adapted to small farming. The Illinois\r\nCentral railroad has done much to attract settlers to Mississippi, and\r\nevery railroad in this section should be equally alert. It was the\r\nrailroad agent who made States out of Territories in the Northwest,\r\nand it is a most assuring sign that he is now taking hold of the\r\nSouthern country. The railroad company is the best of all immigration\r\nor colonization societies. It can accomplish more at less expense\r\nthan any other. The example set, therefore, by the officials of the\r\nPaducah, Tennessee & Alabama, is commendable in the highest degree. The\r\nprosperity of a railroad depends upon the population of the country\r\nthrough which it runs, and the more rapidly the country is built up the\r\nsooner will the stockholders realize upon their investment. The public\r\nhas a profound interest in such enterprises. The Appeal-Avalanche has\r\nno support to give to purely speculative and boom schemes, but it is\r\nin favor of all enterprises the object of which is to put forward the\r\nadvantages of soil, climate and distributing facilities which Tennessee\r\nand other Southern States enjoy to such an exceptional degree.--Memphis\r\nAppeal-Avalanche.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Louisville & Nashville is Pushing Immigration Work.\r\n\r\nCol. C. P. Atmore, the general passenger agent of the Louisville &\r\nNashville railroad, is pushing the matter of immigration to the South\r\nwith great vigor. When approached on the subject recently he said that\r\nthe Louisville & Nashville road had several agents in the Northwest and\r\nin Europe, who were sending families down rapidly. It is the intention\r\nof the road to put between 200 and 300 families on its line between\r\nParis and Memphis.\r\n\r\nThe Louisville & Nashville is now running home-seekers’ excursions\r\nfrom points at a rate of one fare for the round trip, with a view to\r\nencouraging the movement. It owns many thousand acres of land between\r\nNew Orleans and Flomaton, Ala., and also between Pensacola and River\r\nJunction.\r\n\r\nOn the Nashville, Sheffield and Florence branch of the line in question\r\nthere is a Norwegian colony of about 200 families. This colony has done\r\nremarkably well, and the road is much pleased with its venture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Texas Coast Section Filling Up.\r\n\r\nAt Velasco, Texas, recently several carloads of fine draft stock\r\nbelonging to newly arrived farmers from Nebraska were received, and the\r\nnext day several carloads of household goods for another colony from\r\nKansas, who had bought farms in Brazoria county, were unloading. M. M.\r\nMiller, of the Velasco National Bank, and others have received letters\r\nfrom parties who are coming with families and stock from both of these\r\nStates and from New Mexico, Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.\r\n\r\nAt the present rate Brazoria county’s population, it is said, will\r\nbe doubled by the end of the present year; at least 90 per cent. of\r\nincrease began coming in less than two years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonization Plans for Florida.\r\n\r\nMr. O. J. Johnson, excursion, land and colonization agent, of\r\nMinneapolis, has been prospecting in Florida for a site for settling\r\nimmigrants from the North and Northwest.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson will take a good many hundred people South, he says, if\r\nhe has the right encouragement. He was the immigration agent of the\r\nNorthern Pacific railroad for nine years.\r\n\r\nFour business men of Minneapolis are interested with Mr. Johnson. They\r\nare Mr. N. C. Westerfield, Dr. William E. Wheelock, Messrs. P. S. McKay\r\nand C. E. Channel. Their idea is to purchase a tract of land of from\r\n10,000 acres upward, divide it into smaller farms and lots and then\r\nsell these lots to such settlers as they want.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had a deal of experience in this line,” said Mr. Johnson, “and\r\nknow what is to be done. I am well satisfied with Florida’s climate and\r\nattractions, and know that we can settle many hundreds of good people.\r\nWe have a large number of inquiries already, and I am satisfied we can\r\nplace all the people we want to handle. The farmers of Dakota and other\r\npoints in the Northwest are dissatisfied, and hundreds and hundreds of\r\nthem will come the moment they are assured that this State promises\r\nthem a fair living with the work they have to devote now to a mere\r\nexistence.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fruit-Growing Association to Locate in Texas.\r\n\r\nOfficers of the Rock Island Fruit Growers’ and Improvement Association\r\nare in Texas inspecting lands. It is the purpose of the association to\r\nacquire a large tract of land in the Gulf coast region of Texas, in\r\nthe centre of which to lay out a town site, giving to each member of\r\nthe association a town lot. A maximum and minimum ownership of land is\r\nrestricted by the by-laws of the association. Reservations are made for\r\nschool, church, town hall, park and cemetery purposes. No lands can be\r\nheld in unimproved state for speculation; a certain portion of each\r\nowner’s land must be improved during the first year by planting fruit,\r\nvegetables or other horticultural products, and at least two acres\r\nadditional each succeeding year until each owner’s lands are under\r\ncultivation. When the products are ready to ship the shipments will be\r\nmade in car lots to the most advantageous markets of the country.\r\n\r\nThe association expects to number 100 families, composed of persons\r\nwho will go into the Texas coast region and make their homes, their\r\nprevious occupations having been fruit growers, gardeners, mechanics\r\nfrom the government works on the island of Rock Island, clerks,\r\nartisans, etc. While their fruit trees are developing the members of\r\nthe association will raise garden truck for shipment. The officers of\r\nthe association propose visiting the most advantageous sections of\r\nthe Gulf coast, from Houston to Corpus Christi, and will devote about\r\nfour weeks time to that purpose. The originator of the enterprise is\r\nMr. I. E. Whistler, whose attention was directed to Texas as a fruit\r\ngrowing country by seeing and testing some fine specimens of peaches\r\nshipped from Tyler, Texas, last June to New York City, which rivaled\r\nthe best California peaches in size, and far surpassed them in flavor.\r\nThe officers of the association making this tour are I. E. Whistler,\r\npresident; J. O. Logan, vice-president, and W. E. Hilton, trustee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Work of the Mobile & Ohio.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mobile & Ohio Railroad only traverses a few miles\r\nof Alabama, yet it has done probably more in the way of inducing\r\nimmigration to the State since 1890 than any other line, through\r\nextensive advertising, combined with excellent folders and maps, which\r\nhave been extensively distributed through Michigan, Ohio, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, etc. They also pursue the\r\nsame liberal policy with local land agents and all engaged in promoting\r\nimmigration along their road, distributing their advertising matter,\r\nand granting to them courtesies which are necessary to insure local\r\nparties to endeavor to give them the benefit of their work in securing\r\nimmigrants. Alabama wants 10,000 families from the North to settle\r\nwithin her borders in the next twelve months, and only by hard combined\r\nwork of the people and railways can it be accomplished, and now is the\r\ntime to organize and keep the ball rolling. Let us get a move on us in\r\nthis matter, and we can accomplish our object.--The News, Birmingham,\r\nAla.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers to Organise an Immigration Society.\r\n\r\nThe farmers around Augusta, Ga., are becoming interested in a proposed\r\nplan to organize an immigration society, and many have expressed a\r\ndesire to take an active part in perfecting a permanent organization\r\nof that kind.\r\n\r\nA prominent merchant farmer from Wilkes county stated recently that the\r\npeople of his section of the country were very much enthused over the\r\norganization of an immigration society in Augusta.\r\n\r\n“You would be greatly surprised,” he said, “to know how many of our\r\nmerchants and planters have taken up the idea, and how anxious they\r\nare to see such an organization established at Augusta. Our people are\r\nwilling to help in every way possible, for they realize that they are\r\nto reap the benefits, and consequently are desirous of sharing the\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\n“You see, the farmers are generally land poor throughout the entire\r\ncountry, and what they want to do is to get some one who will work, and\r\ntake some of it off their hands.”\r\n\r\n\r\nImmigration Bill Before the Virginia Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Virginia is trying to devise some method to promote\r\nimmigration to the State. A bill has been introduced in the Senate,\r\ncreating the office of Commissioner of Immigration of Virginia, and\r\nproviding for the election of such an officer, who shall properly\r\nadvertise the advantages of the State and shall, at the request of any\r\nreal estate agent or owner of land, keep on file a list of lands for\r\nsale and shall refer all contemplating purchasers impartially to the\r\nvarious sections of the State, according to their requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is provided that the commissioner shall receive a commission of\r\nnot more than 5 per cent. upon the sale of any lands sold through his\r\ndepartment. Any owner of land situate in Virginia shall have the right\r\nto list for sale the same with the Commissioner of Immigration, who\r\nshall advertise, without cost to the owner, the fact that such lands\r\nare offered for sale.\r\n\r\nThe bill concludes by providing that the expenses attached to such\r\nan office shall be paid out of the fund arising from the tax on\r\nmanufacturers of fertilizers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nColonel E.

Of course the country is new, but\r\nvegetables and fruit trees of all kinds are growing nicely. Good fruit\r\nand vegetable land can be bought from $4 to $12 per acre. The country\r\nall around, except on the Gulf side, is a gentle undulated plain, which\r\nis being settled with people from the Northern part of the State and\r\nfrom the Dakotas and Nebraska in the main, and Iowa, though some are\r\nfrom Missouri and other points.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Swedish gentleman who has had considerable experience in establishing\r\ncolonies of his countrymen in the United States, has been conferring\r\nwith Mr. John M.

If we could divide these lands into\r\nhomestead tracts, advertise them extensively and donate them at stated\r\nperiods to actual settlers, what an impetus would be given to the\r\nState. What the State needs is not money for her lands, but active\r\nand enterprising home builders, who would become wealth producers\r\nand tax builders. A liberal land policy on the part of the State and\r\nthe railroads would soon result in a vast increase in our wealth and\r\npopulation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the largest excursion parties of land-seekers that ever went\r\nSouth over the Mobile & Ohio railroad arrived at Mobile lately in\r\ncharge of Mr. F.

The Roland Park Co. is engaged\r\nin developing a fine suburban residence park north of Baltimore,\r\nthree or four miles from the centre of the city. The first building\r\noperations were begun in October, 1892. The first house was completed\r\nearly in the spring of 1893. On the 30th of December, 1893, the date\r\nto which the annual report is brought down, the residences built and\r\nunder construction represented a total cost of more than $300,000. In\r\nthe space of a year a locality that was in effect nothing more than\r\nfarm property has been transformed during a period of unprecedented\r\nfinancial and business stagnation into a beautiful and rapidly\r\ngrowing residence suburb, with all the comforts and conveniences and\r\nappurtenances of life in the thickly built up part of the city. Between\r\nthirty and forty families have moved out to the park for permanent\r\nresidence, and are living in houses that cost from $4000 to $15,000\r\neach. At the initiation of this enterprise there was not a man in\r\nBaltimore who would have looked for such development as this, even with\r\nfavorable business conditions.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is an anomaly in this matter of suburban residence. Up to\r\ntwo or three years ago the city had no rapid transit, and consequently\r\nno suburban development. Its half million people lived in compactly\r\nbuilt rows of brick houses, having neither front nor side yards. The\r\nenterprise of the Roland Park Co. was the first suburban development\r\nundertaking of a high class and on a large scale. Messrs. Jarvis and\r\nConklin, of Kansas City and New York, who have invested in this country\r\nsomething over $30,000,000 of English money, bought 500 or 600 acres of\r\nland immediately north of Baltimore, and proceeded to develop it as a\r\nfirst-class residence suburb. An avenue 120 feet wide was constructed\r\nthrough the property, and a double track electric road was built\r\nthrough the property to a resort at Lake Roland, and coming down to\r\nthe centre of the city at the City Hall and postoffice. A system of\r\nwater works, a complete scientific sewerage system, paved roadways,\r\nasphalt sidewalks, along which shade trees were set out, and electric\r\nlights and other conveniences and accessories to comfort were provided.\r\nUnder the management of Mr. Edward H. Bouton, the vice-president and\r\ngeneral manager of the company, the progress that has been made in\r\nthe actual building up of the locality has been much beyond what was\r\nexpected, and there are many reasons for the assurance that this will\r\nseem small in comparison with the progress that will be made during the\r\ncoming spring and summer.\r\n\r\nThe present high rate of taxation in the city proper, and the recent\r\nlarge expenditures for public improvements that will necessitate an\r\nearly increase in the tax rate are tending to send people into the\r\nsuburbs. This and many other potent causes point to a rapid building up\r\nof Baltimore’s suburban territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubstantial Improvement at Atlanta.\r\n\r\nReal estate is getting active at Atlanta. One firm alone, since January\r\n1st, has sold $128,000 worth of property in the city and vicinity.\r\nSamuel Goode, a realty expert, gives the following opinion of the\r\noutlook in Atlanta:\r\n\r\n“The practical certainty that the United States prison will be located\r\nin Atlanta, the direct probability that the Grand Army of the Republic\r\nwill hold its next convention here, and the settled fact that the\r\ngreatest exposition ever seen in the South will be opened here in\r\n1895--these things combined have given our people hope and confidence\r\nin the continued rapid growth of Atlanta, and the timid have begun to\r\nfind courage enough to turn their money loose for loans and direct\r\ninvestments in real estate. Indeed, the change for the better has\r\nbeen very perceptible to dealers in the last sixty days. It is not\r\nany particular advance in prices which is so marked, because, in this\r\nrespect there has never been any falling off, but it is the fact that\r\npeople are beginning to buy at the normal prices. The best prices\r\nrealized for property at all have been obtained within the past six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n“Another evidence of returning confidence and activity is found in the\r\ndesire and willingness of owners to sell their property at auction. We\r\nalready have a variety of property to be thus sold early this spring.\r\nThere has been a spirit of fairness and liberality manifested by\r\nour citizens, one towards another, in the past year, which is truly\r\ncommendable; and the result is that creditors basing their security\r\nupon real estate have not forced property for sale and broken prices\r\nand distressed if not ruined their debtors; but they have exercised a\r\nwise forbearance, and will soon be rewarded by full payment of all that\r\nis due them, and values have been sustained in Atlanta as in no other\r\ncity within my knowledge. All signs point to an active spring market,\r\nand to the investing here of much outside capital.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSuburban Development at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nA syndicate of St. Louis people is constructing a suburban residence\r\npark at New Orleans. A body of land recently bought for that purpose\r\nmeasures about 700 feet frontage on St. Charles street by 8000 feet\r\ndeep. The plans call for an ornamental entrance in the middle of the\r\nfront, and a graveled driveway through the middle of the plat. As\r\nprojected the entrance will be defended by handsome gates, the carriage\r\nopening being about 100 feet wide, and two gates for foot passengers\r\non either side. Electric lights, prettily arranged, will stud the edge\r\nof the arch leading to the apex, where an ornamental structure of iron\r\nwork will support additional bulbs. About 1500 feet of roadway have\r\nbeen built, leading from the gateway back into the grounds, while equal\r\ndistances of Schillinger pavement have been laid on either side. A plat\r\nhas been reserved in the middle for shade trees and shrubbery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Capital City Real Estate and Investment Company, with a capital\r\nstock of $30,000, has been organized at Austin, Texas.

The Southern Farm Agency, by the way, is one of the most\r\nenterprising and progressive real estate concerns in the South.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe president of the Commercial and Industrial Association of\r\nMontgomery, Ala., in his last monthly report, says: “The real-estate\r\nmarket of Montgomery shows some evidences of improvement. From returns\r\ncompiled of this city for the month of January it is shown that the\r\nincrease of sales is more than 20 per cent. over the corresponding\r\nmonth of last year. The values of desirable business and residence\r\nproperty and also of well situated and improved agricultural lands have\r\nremained steady and are firmly held. It is also believed the spring\r\nand summer will show still greater activity, with perhaps an increase\r\nin values. There are comparatively few vacant houses for a city of\r\nMontgomery’s size, but the prospects and building operations will show\r\nsome falling off the coming year.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA tract of 1575 acres near Velasco, Texas, has been sold to J.

The plans for its development also provide for the building\r\nof factories, hotel, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific Railroad Co. has sold to Otto\r\nPlock, of Paris, France, 7,554 acres of land situated in Ouachita\r\nParish, La. The consideration was $26,440.68 cash. It is said to be the\r\npurpose of the purchaser to establish a large colony of Swedes on these\r\nlands, selling the lands to them in small lots on easy payments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReal estate continues active at Fort Worth, Texas. There is a great\r\ndemand for small houses. “If I had twenty-five such houses today I\r\ncould rent them all before night,” said Mr. W. R. Sanner, a real estate\r\nagent. “I do not know a better investment,” he continued, “than to\r\nbuild such residences, with modern improvements, to cost from $1,000\r\nto $2,500.” Messrs. Huffman & Co. have in hand a trade in adjacent\r\ncounties, for Ohio parties, which represent the sum of $20,000.\r\nCalifornia parties are negotiating for pasture land held at $16,000.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMessrs.

The\r\nenthusiasm which has marked every step of progress shows how thoroughly\r\nin earnest Atlanta is, and gives promise of what may be expected from\r\nthe exposition. Director-General Palmer is getting his working force\r\ninto good shape, and reports that from all sections of the country\r\nthe most hearty and enthusiastic commendations are being received.\r\nIf carried out on the scope upon which it has been planned, this\r\nexposition will be for the South what the World’s Fair was for Chicago\r\nand the country at large. It will centre in the South an amount of\r\ninterest scarcely appreciated now, but which will mean the investment\r\nof many millions and in time of many hundreds of millions of dollars.\r\nIt will also mean a stimulation of the Southward trend of population,\r\nand thousands who are thinking of moving South will be determined by\r\nthe work of the exposition. Everything indicates that the exposition\r\nwill be on a scale far surpassing anything that has ever before been\r\nseen in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nImproving the Dismal Swamp Canal.\r\n\r\nPreparations are being made by Messrs. Ross & Sanford, of Baltimore, to\r\nbegin the work of deepening and otherwise enlarging what is known as\r\nthe Dismal Swamp Canal. The canal, which is twenty-two miles long, will\r\nbe dredged to an average depth of ten feet and widened to sixty feet.\r\nThis will require the removal of 3,000,000 cubic yards of material. As\r\nthe capacity of the average dredge is 3000 yards per day, the magnitude\r\nof the work can be appreciated. Another important work will be the\r\nconstruction of two main and two secondary locks, the main locks to\r\nbe 250×40 feet each in the clear. By the lock system the water in\r\nthe canal level can be raised to a height of thirteen feet. When the\r\nwork is finished vessels with nine feet draught can pass through the\r\nwaterway without difficulty. Some of the lumber needed to build the\r\ndredges to be employed has already arrived at the scene of operations.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money to be expended in this work will be fully\r\n$1,000,000. This passageway is to be used extensively by lumber barges,\r\nfruit and truck steamers and other craft plying between Hampton Roads\r\nand North Carolina waters. The improvements will tend to greatly\r\nincrease the trade between Norfolk, Portsmouth and the tidewater\r\ncountry south of those cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nShipping Alabama Coal to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe increase in coal business at Pensacola, Fla., is very marked, and\r\nan excellent demand is noted for Alabama coal, which thus far has been\r\nthe only kind sent from that city. The Export Coal Co. reports that it\r\nhas one contract for 11,000 tons to be delivered at Tampico by March 1,\r\nalso another for 60,000 tons to be delivered at Vera Cruz and Tampico\r\nduring 1894. The company also has 30,000 tons to be filled on an order\r\nfrom Galveston by June 1. The exports of Alabama coke are very small as\r\nyet, but the indications are that the amount will be greatly increased\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\nNewport News Development.\r\n\r\nEverything seems to be contributing to the building up of a great\r\nseaport city at Newport News, Va. The business over the fast freight\r\nline established by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis and\r\nChesapeake & Ohio from the West to Newport News is being increased by\r\ngrain shipments from along the Chicago & Northwestern. A through rate\r\nhas been made on cereals for export to Liverpool, with the result that\r\nthe new line is not only securing business from Missouri and Kansas and\r\nthe country traversed by the “Big Four” system, but the territory in\r\nDakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa for which the Northwestern is an\r\noutlet. As the latter has about 3500 miles of lines in these States,\r\nthe great advantage of having the Northwestern as a feeder is apparent.\r\nThe people who are forwarding the business have very thoroughly\r\nexamined the facilities at Newport News and were so pleased with them\r\nand the way the business has been handled that they intend making more\r\nextensive exports by way of that port.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is reported that the Vanderbilts have privately\r\nsecured a larger interest in the Chesapeake & Ohio and in Big Four than\r\nthey have ever held, and mean to control absolutely that line from\r\nChicago to the seaboard, with the line of steamers from Newport News.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthern Coal in Chicago.\r\n\r\nPresident M. H. Smith, of the Louisville & Nashville, has arranged\r\nfor a reduction of coal rates from Jellico, which will permit of the\r\nintroduction of Jellico coal into Chicago and Illinois and Michigan\r\npoints on the same basis as West Virginia coal. This will, it is\r\nreported, also include the Middlesborough district. The reduced rate\r\nwill doubtless result in a great increase in the Western shipments\r\nof Kentucky coal, the superior quality of which has created for it a\r\nWestern demand, despite high freights.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpening Texas Coal Mines.\r\n\r\nThe extensive coal deposits near the Rio Grande, in Presidio county,\r\nTexas, it is stated, are to be opened and mined on an extensive scale\r\nby the San Carlos Coal Co., which controls 53,000 acres of land\r\ncontaining veins of semi-bituminous coal forty-one inches thick in some\r\nplaces. President S. A. Johnston, of the company, in a letter to the\r\nManufacturers’ Record, says that his company has made a contract to\r\nsell at least 115,000 tons yearly to the Southern Pacific Railroad. The\r\nNorthern office of the company is at Pittsburg, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother Florida Canal.\r\n\r\nWork is about to begin on a canal in Florida which will be of great\r\nimportance to the lumbering and agricultural interests of the section\r\nthrough which it is to pass. It will extend from a point in Marion\r\ncounty, at the head of Ratcliff’s prairie to Mill Creek swamp. It will\r\nbe eleven miles long and thirty feet wide at the bottom. The estimated\r\ncost of dredging the canal is $75,000. The object of the canal is to\r\nreclaim thousands of acres of submerged swamp lands, covered with\r\nrich muck from five to ten feet in depth, with a clay bottom, and to\r\nprovide transportation for pine and cypress timber.\r\n\r\nThe syndicate interested has purchased 15,000 acres of land along its\r\nline. When the improvements are completed they expect to engage largely\r\nin the growing of rice and sugar-cane, and hold out inducements to\r\nsettlers who desire to buy rich lands cheap. D. D. Rogers, at Ocala, is\r\nengineer. Among the capitalists interested is Christian Ax, of the firm\r\nof G. W. Gail & Ax, Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother Big Enterprise for Norfolk.\r\n\r\nFollowing the announcement that the Chesapeake & Ohio is to enter\r\nNorfolk comes the statement that the United States Cotton Warehouse\r\n& Loan Co. has asked for legislative authority to build wharves,\r\nwarehouses, elevators and other buildings; also to construct and\r\noperate a terminal railway not over five miles in length. It is also to\r\nconduct a general wharfage and warehouse business, with a capital of\r\nat least $50,000. The main office is to be in Norfolk or Portsmouth.\r\nThe corporators are Edward A. Pierson, of New York; John H. Dingee, of\r\nPhiladelphia; J. Andre Mottu, of Norfolk; J. R. McMurran, of St. Paul,\r\nMinn.; Heber Alter, of Philadelphia; James Y. Leigh, of Norfolk; S.\r\nHenry Norris, of Philadelphia; William Burrington, of Philadelphia;\r\nHerman Niemeyer, of Portsmouth; Fergus Reid, of Norfolk; C. W.\r\nMurdaugh, Marcellus Miller, of Berkley; Parke Poindexter, of Berkley;\r\nWilliam Goddin, of Philadelphia; William Schmoele, Jr., of Portsmouth;\r\nJohn L. Vaughman, O. P. Heath, S. L. Burroughs and Walter S. Taylor. A\r\nnumber of well-known capitalists appear in the list, and the enterprise\r\nevidently means much for Norfolk and vicinity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Florence Pump Co., of Florence, Ala., has made a contract with a\r\nPhiladelphia firm to supply $40,000 worth of pumps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe water works plant at Yorkville, S. C., has been completed, tested\r\nand accepted by the town council. The plant consists of about three\r\nmiles of mains, a stand pipe seventy feet high on a fifty-foot tower,\r\n120 feet in all, with a capacity of 60,000 gallons. The water is\r\nforced into the stand pipe by a pump of 500,000 gallons capacity,\r\nand the stream which furnishes the water will furnish (estimated)\r\n150,000 gallons a day. There are 800 feet of hose, and the total cost,\r\nincluding hose, was $16,800.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Shea Plating and Manufacturing Co., of Cleveland, Ohio, has entered\r\ninto a contract to remove to Macon, Ga., and the work of transferring\r\nthe plant has begun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRailroad communication and the building of ice factories on the west\r\ncoast of Florida, have resulted in the building up of an important\r\nfishing industry, which is growing rapidly. St. Petersburg, Clearwater,\r\nDunedin, Ozona, Sea Side and Tarpon Springs are the principal shipping\r\npoints, and there was forwarded from these ports for 1893 a total of\r\n7,901 barrels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Fort Worth Gazette says of Terrell Texas: “Never before in the\r\nhistory of Terrell and vicinity has there been such demand for homes\r\nand tillable grounds. Many persons having large pastures are cutting\r\nthem up in farms, at least a portion, and if the demand increases the\r\nlarge pastures will have to be given up to farming interests instead\r\nof grass pastures. Several thousand acres of new land will be put in\r\ncultivation this year in this county.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor several weeks Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co., printers and publishers,\r\nhave had an agent in the South prospecting for the most suitable place,\r\nin point of business and situation, to establish a distributing house,\r\ntheir main houses being in New York and Chicago. Charlotte, N. C., has\r\nfinally been fixed upon as the most desirable point.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNewport News had the honor of constructing the first iron and steel\r\nmerchant vessels built in the South, and the largest ever launched in\r\nthe United States. El Cid, made famous by being turned into a warship\r\nfor the Brazilian government, enjoys the distinction of having broken\r\nall records in the passage between New York and New Orleans. El Norte,\r\nEl Rio, and El Sud are not far behind her. Following this distinction\r\ncomes the docking for repairs of the big American liner New York, which\r\nwas done February 19. The New York is the largest ship ever docked\r\nin America. No other yard on this side the Atlantic could do it. The\r\nNewport News dock has but one rival in point of size--the government\r\ndock, at Brooklyn--and it is doubtful if that is large enough to admit\r\nof her entrance. As soon as the big ship touched the dock a force of\r\n1000 men was put to work upon her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new manufacturing enterprise of some importance is about to be\r\ninaugurated at Bedford City, Va., by Mr. W. B. Dunn, who has organized\r\nthe Bedford Manufacturing Co., with himself as secretary. The\r\ncompany’s purpose is to manufacture custom-made clothing to be sold\r\nat manufacturers’ prices, making a specialty of trousers, using the\r\nproduct of all leading Southern woolen mills, as well as other fine\r\nforeign and domestic goods. It is intended to appoint agents in all\r\ntowns and cities in the South having 4000 inhabitants or more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe city hall at Richmond, Va., recently completed at a cost of\r\n$1,370,000, is one of the finest municipal buildings in the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is announced that the Boston capitalists who have decided to invest\r\nabout $300,000 in an office-building in Atlanta, Ga., have secured a\r\nsite and are to have plans prepared at once. Mr. H. M. Atkinson, who\r\nis their Atlanta representative, states that the building is to be\r\nfire-proof, ten stories high and will contain all the features of the\r\nmodern structure for offices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHon. Jonathan Norcross, of Atlanta, Ga., is having plans prepared for\r\na five-story building for offices to cost several hundred thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall but Vigorous.\r\n\r\nThe Houston East & West Texas Railroad, running from Houston, Texas, to\r\nShreveport, La., is not very much of a road as to mileage, but there is\r\nmore hustle about it than most roads of ten times the length exhibit.\r\nWith only 232 miles of road the company is doing more relatively\r\ntowards the development of the country it traverses than almost any\r\nother road in the country. Recently a development department has\r\nbeen created and put in charge of General John M. Claiborne, an old\r\nnewspaper man. Among other methods of building up the territory of\r\nthe road, and besides the usual concessions to settlers in the way of\r\npassenger and freight rates, the company has offered to contribute to\r\na common fund an amount equal to all that can be raised by the people\r\nof the counties through which the road passes, the money to be spent in\r\ngetting in settlers. The road promises to locate at least one family\r\nfor every two dollars the citizens of these counties will raise. The\r\ncountry through which this road passes includes some superb farm and\r\ngarden lands, and large areas of original forest timber, pine and hard\r\nwoods, and with the energy and push of the managers of the road it will\r\nnot be long before immigrants will be pouring into their country.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the road are E. S. Jemison, president; M. G. Howe,\r\nvice-president; M. S. Meldrum, secretary and treasurer, and T. Cronin,\r\nsuperintendent, all of Houston.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. A. A. Arthur and Middlesborough.\r\n\r\nThe people of Middlesborough, Ky., and Middlesborough property\r\nowners living elsewhere are making strenuous efforts to induce the\r\nMiddlesborough Town Lands Co. to reappoint Mr. A. A. Arthur to the\r\nactive management of the company’s affairs. Ever since the termination\r\nof Mr. Arthur’s management the town has been in a state of virtual\r\nstagnation, and it is believed that Mr. Arthur alone can rescue it\r\nfrom collapse and restore it to its former condition of growth and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nSeveral delegations of citizens and property owners have called on\r\nthe company’s present commissioner at Middlesborough, Mr. Lionel H.\r\nGraham, of London, and urged him to bring about the appointment of Mr.\r\nArthur. On February 17, a mass meeting was held, at which the following\r\nresolutions were adopted:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, By the people of Middlesborough in mass meeting assembled,\r\nthat the opportunity presented by Mr. L. H. Graham, who is now in our\r\nmidst as the representative of the stockholders of the Town Lands\r\nCo., seeking information and encouragement for the guidance of his\r\nassociates, be seized, and that we, the citizens and property owners\r\nof Middlesborough, who have borne the brunt of all the troubles of\r\npast two and one-half years, and have witnessed and studied both\r\nadministrations, and who have been with the stockholders in prosperity\r\nand adversity, respectfully but emphatically ask a return to the old\r\noriginal plan of administering the affairs of the Town Lands Co.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we know that all the great and valuable resources upon\r\nwhich the city was started still exist; we have seen railroads brought\r\nto us and great enterprises created in our midst. The necessities of a\r\ncity have been established, all legitimate expenditures have been made\r\nand nothing now remains to be done to re-establish credit, activity and\r\nprogress, but the appointment of a leader, a wise and liberal man, one\r\nof intelligence, wide experience, integrity and extended connections,\r\none in whom we can place great confidence.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in Mr. A. A. Arthur, creator and projector of\r\nMiddlesborough and all the adjacent territory, we find such a man. None\r\nother has so great an interest. We will stand by him and we believe\r\nand know that he alone can pull you, the stockholders, and us, the\r\ncitizens, out of the abject state in which we now are.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we most heartily ask for and will most cordially\r\napprove the reappointment of Mr. A. A. Arthur to the active management\r\nof the Middlesborough Town Lands Co.; we believe that he can\r\nrescue this city from ruin, and the sooner the management is placed\r\nin his hands the sooner will confidence be restored and values be\r\nre-established.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the interests of the Town Lands Co. are alike the\r\ninterests of the city and the citizens thereof; one cannot prosper\r\nwithout the other, hence the citizens and property owners are\r\nprofoundly earnest in their desire to see Mr. Arthur restored to power,\r\nas they believe that his restoration will give new life not only to\r\nMiddlesborough but to Southeastern Kentucky as well, and that we will\r\nenter upon a career of unexampled prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Annual Fair at New Berne, N. C.\r\n\r\nThe annual fair of the East Carolina Industrial Association was held in\r\nNew Berne on February 19th to 23d, inclusive, and was formally opened\r\nby Gov. Carr with a sterling address, in which he referred to the\r\ntidewater region as the garden spot of the continent, enumerating its\r\nresources and estimating their economic value, present and prospective.\r\nThe exhibit, as a whole, was a surprise to home visitors as well as\r\nstrangers, especially in marine, agricultural and mechanical products.\r\nIts mineral exhibit was remarkable in respect to native ores and\r\nprecious stones. Thirty-one counties in the State are mining gold at\r\na profit. Nuggets were shown which were valued at $52 and upwards.\r\nEighty-five varieties of commercial woods were shown. There was a great\r\nvariety of building stones. Tomato plants six inches high, garden peas\r\nthree inches high, and strawberry blossoms were shown. The department\r\nof ladies’ work was superlative. Dairy products were meagre, only three\r\nsamples of butter being shown. There was a great variety of feed in\r\nbales--native grasses, stock peas and corn fodder. Fine samples of\r\nwool and blankets were exhibited. The same blankets took a premium at\r\nChicago. Some fine Southdown sheep from the Tucker farm near Raleigh\r\nwere on view. There were some fine Jersey, Devon and Alderney cattle,\r\nand superior Berkshire and Red Jersey pigs and fat hogs, running up to\r\n600 pounds in weight.\r\n\r\nThe fish and oyster exhibit, with the nets and apparatus, is always a\r\nprominent feature of the annual expositions, and was well sustained.\r\nRoe shad were remarkably fine.\r\n\r\nThere was an attractive exhibit of live and dead game and fur-bearing\r\nanimals, and two curious hybrids between turkey, guinea fowl and\r\nPlymouth Rock hen. The floral exhibit was simply exquisite, and the\r\ncolonial relics and old family plate and curios were very interesting.\r\nThere was never such a poultry show seen on earth for quality and\r\nvariety. At least two kinds were shown!\r\n\r\nIn the department of Women’s Work the productions of deft fingers were\r\nastonishing in all fabrics, laces, gold embroidery, feathers, flowers,\r\netc., rivaling Japanese art, and causing Valenciennes to blush with\r\njealousy. Altogether, there was a wonderful diversity of industrial\r\nproducts of which the old North State and all her sisters may be proud.\r\nNew Berne herself has earned honors.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Immigration Bill in the Maryland Legislature.\r\n\r\nA bill is to be introduced in the legislature of Maryland, which is\r\nnow in session, enlarging the powers of the chief of the bureau of\r\nindustrial statistics so as to give him authority to provide for the\r\nsettlement of immigrants in Maryland. The bill makes it the duty of the\r\nchief of the bureau to collect reliable information in every county of\r\nthe State bearing upon the question of immigration, and authorizes him\r\nto appoint a local immigrant commissioner in each county. The local\r\ncommissioners are to receive $2.50 a day for each day of actual service\r\nand personal expenses, the expenses are to be itemized and certified\r\nto before a justice of the peace, and $1.00 for each immigrant sixteen\r\nyears of age and over settled by them in their respective counties.\r\nTheir duties, under the direction of the chief of the bureau, are to\r\nprocure the statistics and information necessary to properly set forth\r\nthe facts, advantages and conditions of the counties, to perform such\r\nother duties appertaining to the work of the bureau as may be required\r\nand to procure options on farm lands at such prices and upon such terms\r\nas will be within the means of the immigrants desiring to locate upon\r\nthem and to give them such assistance, care and information within\r\ntheir province as may be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe owners of lands upon which options have been thus secured shall\r\nupon the sale of the lands through the agency of the bureau, pay to the\r\nchief of the bureau a commission of 5 per cent. upon the gross amount\r\nof the sale, the sum thus obtained to be used in defraying the general\r\nexpenses of the bureau and to be accounted for by the chief of the\r\nbureau in the itemized statement of receipts and expenditures which he\r\nis at present required by law to publish in his report and to make to\r\nthe State comptroller.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the bureau is authorized to visit such States and\r\ncountries as in his judgment may be necessary, or to send an authorized\r\nagent, for the purpose of securing immigrants, having special regard\r\nto the character and responsibility of the immigrants. He is to adopt\r\nsuch means of advertising the State’s advantages as may commend\r\nthemselves to his judgment, including such maps, charts, &c., as\r\nmay be best calculated to illustrate the geographical, geological,\r\ntopographical and physical features of the State, and to make contracts\r\nwith railroads, steamship and other transportation companies and the\r\nmasters of sailing vessels to secure a low rate of transportation for\r\nimmigrants and to make the necessary arrangements for their temporary\r\nreception and accommodation upon their arrival until they can be\r\nlocated.\r\n\r\nThe bill provides the sum of $10,000, or so much thereof as may be\r\nnecessary, in addition to the present annual appropriation of the\r\nbureau to carry out the provisions of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\nPacking-Houses in the South.\r\n\r\nThe people of the South have so long been accustomed to buying\r\ntheir meat from Northern and Western markets that the suggestion of\r\npacking-houses in the Southern cities is full of novelty and surprise.\r\nPacking-houses distributed over the Southern territory would be the\r\nincentive for farmers to raise more hogs and cattle and a better\r\nquality, and thus create a source of revenue now practically closed to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAre not our people convinced of the folly of selling their marketable\r\nlive stock to drovers and buying their meat, thus paying the cost of\r\ntransportation both ways, besides the profit each handler obtains?\r\n\r\nPork and beef raised on our own farms and cured in our own\r\npacking-houses would keep at home the large sums of money sent off\r\nannually for the meat supply of the people.\r\n\r\nThe grocerymen of Jackson purchase every year about $100,000 worth of\r\nmeat and lard for consumers in this immediate section, and it is easily\r\nseen that a packing-house in Jackson would be a profitable industry. It\r\nwould furnish a home market for hog and cattle-raisers, and stimulate\r\nthe production of the best qualities. Every step in this direction is\r\nan important gain, and the subject deserves the earnest attention of\r\nour live and progressive citizens.--The Whig, Jackson, Tenn.\r\n\r\n\r\nSponge Fishing in Florida.\r\n\r\nThe vessels that are used in the business are chiefly schooner-rigged\r\nand vary in size from five to twenty-five tons burden. They carry crews\r\nranging from five in number to fifteen for the largest vessels, nine\r\nmen to the boat being the average number. The odd man in each case is\r\nthe cook, who remains aboard to provide for the inner wants of the crew\r\n(generally amazingly large) and sails the craft while the balance are\r\noff in the small boats called dingeys in search of sponge. Each vessel\r\nis provided with poles of various lengths, from fifteen to fifty feet,\r\nto be used according to the depth of water in which they are working,\r\nwhich have attached to them three pronged hooks shaped like the teeth\r\nof a garden rake, somewhat heavier, with which the sponge are detached\r\nfrom the objects to which they are adhered and drawn into the dingey.\r\n\r\nTwo men are necessary to operate a dingey, one, the “hooker,” using\r\nthe pole and the sculler keeping the boat in motion, following the\r\ndirections of the hooker, where he leans over the side looking through\r\nan ordinary wooden bucket with a glass sealed in its bottom for the\r\nsponge, which, when discovered, is secured with the hooks.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman are most all former inhabitants of the islands; many of\r\nthem have lived in the Bahamas, and there are about equal numbers of\r\nwhite men and negroes.\r\n\r\nThey are designated “Conchs” by the people living upon the mainland,\r\nfrom their making use of that shell animal for edible purposes when\r\nliving upon their native islands.\r\n\r\nA trip is of eight to ten weeks’ duration, unless it is mutually agreed\r\nby the owner and the crew that it shall end sooner, and a “broken” trip\r\nis one which does not pay expenses incurred, and does not happen often,\r\nexcept during a period of disaster like that just passed through.\r\n\r\nWhen the trip is finished the catches are carried to market where the\r\npurchaser bids upon them at a certain price per bunch or for the lot,\r\nhaving previously estimate from his thorough knowledge of the goods\r\ntheir value in pounds.\r\n\r\nBefore sending them to the various markets they are first trimmed\r\nneatly and cleaned of all rock and shell, and then packed in bales of\r\nconvenient sizes in a compress which reduces them to small bulk and\r\nrenders them easily handled.\r\n\r\nOwing to the scarcity of the supply the demand is at present very\r\ngreat, and excellent prices are obtained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Newnan (Ga.)

It requires but little stock to\r\ncultivate them and but few hands, comparatively speaking, to do the\r\nwork.

The\r\nhotels are crowded with traveling salesmen, all of whom appear to be\r\ndoing good business, selling principally dry goods, clothing, hats,\r\ncaps, shoes and articles of similar character, and very few provisions.\r\nMany places are purchasing a better class of dry goods than they had in\r\ntwenty years back.

In the\r\nYazoo Delta a farmer has grown all the provisions--corn and seed--for\r\nhis new crop, and has sufficient left over to purchase a reaper for his\r\ncoming hay crop. He has contracted for the produce of five acres of\r\npotatoes, seven acres of onions, and he will be self-supporting from\r\nthis date forward. He is only one of a great many, and it seems to me\r\nthat with fewer applications for loans and less demand for money to\r\ncarry cotton, capital must seek other sources of employment.

Now Florida berries are sent\r\nNorth as late as May 1.\r\n\r\nA refrigerator company will begin business at Gainesville, Fla., this\r\nweek, and for the extra charge of ten cents per package they insure\r\nthe arrival of truck at destination in the same condition as when put\r\naboard the cars here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome of the cities of Tennessee have become interested in the idea of\r\nhaving an exposition to celebrate the State’s centennial. At a meeting\r\nof the Nashville Commercial Club a resolution was adopted providing\r\nfor a committee of twenty-five members, composed of seven from the\r\nCommercial Club, six from the Board of Trade and three each from the\r\nSouthern Engineering Association, the Historical Society and the Art\r\nAssociation, to make arrangements for a convention to be held in the\r\ncity in March to discuss plans for an exposition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade of Nashville, Tenn., is one of the few such concerns\r\nthat has life and activity and progressiveness. Major A. W. Wills, the\r\nrecently elected secretary, is a man full of zeal and energy, and he\r\nwill make the board of trade a power in the advancement of Nashville\r\nand the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stockholders of the Luna Cotton Mills, Fort Mill, S. C., have voted\r\nto extend the plant and add considerable new machinery, including 100\r\nlooms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithin the last twelve month taxable values in Texas have increased\r\n$30,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILROADS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Richmond & Danville to the Front.\r\n\r\nThe Richmond & Danville Railroad Co. has issued the following circular\r\noffering special inducements to settlers:\r\n\r\n“The Richmond & Danville Railroad adopts this means as one of its many\r\nmethods of bringing to the attention of prospectors and home-seekers\r\nthe numerous advantages possessed by the territory which it traverses.\r\n\r\n“Realizing that each section of this great land of ours is dependent to\r\na certain extent upon the prosperity of the whole, we have no desire to\r\ndepreciate any section, but to make known the possibilities which are\r\nwithin the reach of those who contemplate a change.\r\n\r\n“We have received hundreds of inquiries from parties located in the\r\nNorth and Northwest who desire information in regard to a milder and\r\nmore congenial climate, the character of soil, etc. Those and all\r\nothers who may desire information, we invite to visit points upon\r\nour lines which cover the States of Virginia, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, and to induce immigration\r\nwe will make to _bona fide_ prospectors special concessions in rates\r\nfrom our Eastern junction points.\r\n\r\n“The climate and products of the last four States above named are well\r\nknown, but Virginia and North Carolina have not been so fortunate in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n“The climate in these sister States (Virginia and North Carolina)\r\nis about the same, showing an average the year around of about 55°\r\nFahrenheit, with no extreme heat or cold, which enables farmers to\r\nraise two or more crops upon the same land in one season. The soil is\r\nadapted to any crops which are raised in the Southern or Middle States,\r\nand is especially favorable for trucking, the profits of which are\r\nenhanced by reason of the close proximity to the best Eastern markets,\r\nviz: Lynchburg, Richmond, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New\r\nYork. It is also admirably adapted to fruit and grape culture.\r\n\r\n“Without discriminating in favor of any portion of either of these\r\nStates, we feel at liberty to direct especial attention to the Blue\r\nRidge section of North Carolina as being excellently adapted to the\r\nculture of fruit and grapes, the mountains and hillsides at many points\r\nbeing now covered by vineyards and orchards, which yield handsome\r\nrevenues to their owners, while the rich valleys are utilized for\r\ncereals and tobacco.\r\n\r\n“Considering the productive qualities of these Virginia and North\r\nCarolina lands, they may be had at most reasonable prices and on\r\naccommodating terms.\r\n\r\n“In order to protect ourselves against imposition, it is necessary\r\nto throw some safeguard around the issuance of reduced rates for\r\nprospectors, as above indicated, and as all prospectors, before\r\nstarting on a trip of this nature, correspond with some land agency or\r\nreal estate agent, we will request all applicants for these reduced\r\nrates to obtain identification at the hands of such agent or land\r\nagency as they may have corresponded with.”\r\n\r\nInquiries may be addressed to W. A. Turk, general passenger agent, 1300\r\nPennsylvania avenue, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother Mississippi Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Pacific Railroad Co.’s bridge to be built across the\r\nMississippi river at New Orleans, La., will, it is believed, be the\r\nlargest steel railroad bridge in the world, considering the quantity\r\nof metal used in its construction and its length. It will be a\r\ndouble-track bridge about 10,500 feet long. The approach spans will\r\nvary from twenty-five to 150 feet in length, according to the height\r\nof the towers. The main river bridge will be built on the cantilever\r\nprinciple, and will be 1070 feet in length, with spans of 608 feet\r\non either side. The pier foundations will extend from a point eighty\r\nfeet below the bottom of the river, and will be sunk by open dredging.\r\nThe estimated weight of metal required is 25,000 tons, or 50,000,000\r\npounds. The cost will be about $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe bridge will give the Southern Pacific system an all-rail entrance\r\ninto New Orleans, and form a most important link in railroad\r\ncommunication between Texas and the Southwest and the Gulf States east\r\nof the Mississippi river.\r\n\r\nThe largest railroad bridge completed is over the Firth of Forth in\r\nScotland. The main structure is 5330 feet long, but the approaches are\r\nsaid to be shorter than the New Orleans bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Judicial Decision of Great Interest to Railroads.\r\n\r\nIn two suits recently brought against the Texas & Pacific road, a New\r\nOrleans judge has rendered a decision that is of very general interest.\r\nThe decision in brief is that a railroad is bound by the admissions\r\ncontained in the bill of lading just as the shipper is bound by the\r\nterms. Several weeks ago two suits, exactly the same except for the\r\namounts involved and the complainants’ identity, were filed against the\r\nTexas & Pacific road. In both damages was asked for cotton received\r\nin a damaged condition, which the bill of lading sets forth had been\r\nreceived by the road in good condition.\r\n\r\nIn both cases the plaintiffs introduced the bills of lading in\r\nevidence. They showed by the signature of the authorized agents of the\r\nroad that the cotton had been received by the road for shipment in good\r\ncondition. The road in its defense attempted to prove that the cotton\r\nwas received in the same condition as when delivered, and that it had\r\nnot been damaged in transportation.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs both proved that upon the receipt of the bills of\r\nlading, specifying that the cotton had been received by the road in\r\ngood condition, they had paid for it by sight drafts in favor of the\r\nshippers.\r\n\r\nIn his decisions, both of which were the same, the judge held that\r\nevidence to disapprove the statements contained in the road’s bill\r\nof lading was inadmissible, and that the bill of lading placed the\r\nresponsibility for the condition of the cotton with the road. For these\r\nreasons judgment in both cases was for the plaintiff. The conclusion\r\nof the court was that when the consignee pays by sight draft upon\r\nthe averment of the bill of lading evidence that the goods were not\r\nreceived in good condition is not admissible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is stated that in furtherance of a plan to shorten the distance\r\nbetween St. Louis and points in Western Texas and Mexico, a syndicate\r\nhas been formed to complete the Red River & Southwestern road, which is\r\nprojected from a point on the Rock Island road in the Indian Territory\r\nthrough Western Texas to San Angelo, to connect with the Southern\r\nPacific at Spotswood Junction. It is estimated that the new route would\r\nshorten the distance between Mexico and St. Louis fully 600 miles,\r\nwhile points in Southwestern Texas will be 200 miles nearer the latter\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC. W. Cheers, formerly assistant general freight agent in Birmingham of\r\nthe Kansas City, Memphis & Birmingham, but who resigned on January 1,\r\nhas been appointed general freight and passenger agent of the Savannah,\r\nAmericus & Montgomery, with headquarters at Americus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch interest has been aroused by the bills pending in the Virginia\r\nlegislature to incorporate the Richmond & Northern and Richmond &\r\nManassas roads. The former is claimed to be a projected road from\r\nRichmond to Fredericksburg, and the latter between Richmond and\r\nManassas. Either would form part of a line from Richmond very nearly\r\nto Washington, and it is intimated that the Baltimore & Ohio may be\r\ninterested in one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the Baltimore & Ohio is preparing to build its branch\r\nroad from a point north of Georgetown, D. C., to Fairfax C. H., Va.,\r\non which work was begun some time ago, but suspended for some unknown\r\ncause. Fairfax is but a short distance from the Richmond & Danville\r\nroad, with which the Baltimore & Ohio has close relations, and it is\r\nevident that the building of this branch means a connection with the\r\nRichmond & Danville.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk & Western road is also securing the necessary legislation\r\nto enter Washington.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the indications of the rapidly-developing trade between the\r\nNorth and South is the establishment of a fast through freight from\r\nNew York to the South by the Atlantic Coast Line. Freight under the\r\nnew regulation, no matter how small the consignment, is rushed through\r\nfrom the North without delay. With each succeeding season this service\r\nhas been expanded and improved, keeping pace with the development\r\nof the industries which produced it, until finally it has reached a\r\npoint of usefulness and perfection upon which it would be difficult to\r\nimprove. Until the present season, however, this special service has\r\nbeen confined to a northward-going schedule, but lately it has become\r\napparent that the demand for a similar service from the North to the\r\nSouth was daily becoming more and more urgent. The Atlantic Coast\r\nDispatch has also established a line of refrigerator cars out of New\r\nYork for Charleston, the service being designed to furnish the safest\r\nand most expeditious transportation for all southward-going perishable\r\nfreight. These cars will prove of especial advantage to the large\r\nshippers of apples, butter and other perishable articles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the Richmond & Danville’s present management\r\nwill soon secure a seaboard outlet at Norfolk or Portsmouth, either\r\nby acquiring the Atlantic & Danville, which, as stated elsewhere, is\r\nto be purchased by the English bondholders at foreclosure sale and\r\nreorganized, or by building a new line. The plans of a new company\r\nwhich has been formed to build an extension of the Atlantic & Danville\r\nfrom Danville to Bristol, Tenn., passing through rich and undeveloped\r\ncoal and ore lands, are told of elsewhere. The building of the proposed\r\nVirginia Seaboard & Western road, and the control of the Atlantic &\r\nDanville by the Richmond & Danville, would give the latter not only a\r\nnew seaboard terminus, but also a large coal, timber and ore traffic\r\nfrom Tennessee and Virginia, as well as establish a new route from\r\nTennessee, Kentucky and the Northwest to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe projectors of the Gulf & Interstate Railroad to extend from North\r\nDakota to the Gulf of Mexico have secured an option on property at Port\r\nBolivar, on Galveston bay, opposite Galveston, Texas, with a view to\r\nmaking that the terminus of the road.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe New York, Texas & Mexican and the Gulf, Western Texas & Pacific\r\nroads, both parts of the Southern Pacific system, have elected the\r\nfollowing-named officers: President, J.

C., February\r\n19, to consider the matter of transportation of vegetables and fruits\r\nto New York, a member had this to say in praise of the famous Old\r\nDominion line of steamers:\r\n\r\n“They have fast steamers especially constructed for carrying highly\r\nperishable freights; they have ample tonnage for handling all the\r\nbusiness that comes to them, and their deliveries in New York are not\r\nonly convenient to the trade, but are made more rapidly than any other\r\nline with whom we do business.\r\n\r\n“In addition to their already large fleet they are about to launch\r\ntwo splendid new steamers, the “Jamestown” and “Yorktown,” which will\r\nbe ready by April 10, and are expected to be the fastest coastwise\r\nsteamers out of New York.\r\n\r\n“Our experience with the Old Dominion Co. covers more than thirty\r\nyears. During that time they have always been found willing to do\r\nall in their power to assist the grower both in improved service\r\nand in giving as low rates of freight as are consistent with fast\r\ntransportation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic Coast Line system has been one of the most liberal and\r\nprogressive roads in the South in fostering the trucking business along\r\nits line. It has made a specialty of its truck traffic for many years,\r\nand to its enterprise is largely due the magnitude of the business\r\nwhich is now done out of Charleston.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Middle Georgia & Atlanta road, from Atlanta to Milledgeville, has\r\njust been completed. It is seventy-five miles shorter from Atlanta\r\nto Milledgeville by this route than by any other. Over forty miles of\r\nthe line between Covington and Eatonton has no bonded debt whatever,\r\n$450,000 of the stock being taken and paid for by Georgia people. The\r\nultimate destination of the line is Savannah. W. B. Thomas is general\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic & Danville, which extends from Danville across Southern\r\nVirginia to the Seaboard, has attracted considerable interest from the\r\nfact that a company has been organized, composed largely of bondholders\r\nof the road, to build a line from Danville to Bristol, Tenn., to be\r\ncalled the Virginia Seaboard & Western. The Atlantic & Danville is to\r\nbe sold by order of the court on April 3, and, it is expected, will be\r\npurchased by the bondholders. The new road, if built, will be about\r\n115 miles long and connect with the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia\r\nsystem at Bristol. It would give the latter an outlet on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard and develop much mineral property of east Tennessee and\r\nsouthern Virginia, the product of which now has no means of reaching\r\nfurnaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOTELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Four Seasons Hotel at Harrogate, Tenn., has been reopened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMessrs.

I presume you sent\r\nit, knowing that the interesting letters relating to the subject of\r\nimmigration to the Southern States so fully coincide with the views I\r\nhave long held and have expressed to you concerning immigration from\r\nGreat Britain to the South.\r\n\r\n“Those views were verified again only a few days ago in the following\r\nmanner: A friend of mine, who is a builder, wished to “talk with me\r\nabout America,” rather a big order if he had considered a little,\r\nas having but limited means and a growing family he “thought of\r\nemigrating.” _Where_ should he go? He spoke of many of the States I\r\nknow well, but he knew nothing of the South, except that they had\r\noranges and alligators in Florida. He was a fairly intelligent man,\r\ntoo. After a long conversation, the length of which you will understand\r\nwhen I tell you that I conducted my friend from the blinding blizzards\r\nof Nebraska to the genial sunshine of Alabama, I promised to get him\r\nsome printed information from some of the emigration agents in London,\r\nso that he could form an idea as to the requirements, capabilities and\r\nresources of the South. Well, I tried to keep my promise, and called\r\non numerous agents. I could obtain _any amount_ of information about\r\nany part of Canada and the Western States, but in this great city of\r\n6,000,000 of people, I, an experienced Londoner, could not obtain a\r\nline about Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana or\r\nany other Southern State, except Florida, and as I enjoyed life in\r\nthe latter State for over three years I could describe a gopher or a\r\n“Florida cracker,” better than the agent could. Is it to be wondered at\r\nthat people from England know the West and are ignorant of the beauties\r\nof the South? There, you have your Southern difficulty in a nutshell.\r\nWe have over 35,000,000 of people on these little islands, very few\r\nof whom really know anything whatever of the Southern States. We have\r\ntens of thousands of men--small capitalists, manufacturers, skilled\r\nartizans, farmers, dairymen, market gardeners, and business men of all\r\nclasses--who would give up the, in most cases, hopeless struggle here\r\n(hopeless as far as a comfortable competence is concerned), and cross\r\nover to the Southern States with their wives and families _if they\r\nonly knew_ the power of their skill, industry and perseverance in a\r\ncountry where those qualities will give an ampler, fairer and a more\r\njust reward than here. These people, the hewers of wood and drawers\r\nof water, who are the backbone of every prosperous country, require\r\ninformation, _official_, _authoritative_, _reliable_ information, about\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, &c., and it is simply because\r\nsuch information is lacking, difficult to obtain, or unreliable when\r\nit is obtained, that so many go West and Northwest, whilst others, who\r\n_could_ be induced to go South, stay and struggle on in the old rut\r\nfor want of being waked up. I feel perfectly sure that if a bureau\r\nof information were established here in London and supplied with\r\nliterature, maps, &c., descriptive of the Southern States, and properly\r\nadvertised throughout Great Britain, the results would be quickly felt,\r\nwhilst the expense would be infinitesimal compared with the benefits\r\nwhich would eventually accrue. Such a bureau, however, would have to be\r\nmanaged by a man (or men) of integrity and experience, who should be as\r\nunbiased as possible, and entirely free from sectional prejudice. An\r\nagent should have sufficient business tact to know that he would never\r\nbenefit Georgia or Alabama by disparaging Colorado or California. I\r\nknow that many agents in England try to detract from every other State,\r\nand every other section of a State, except the little spot they are for\r\nthe time pecuniarily interested in getting settled up. Their aims are\r\nnarrowed down to simply getting commissions on the railway and ocean\r\ntickets, and a small prearranged percentage on any little land purchase\r\nthe immigrant may make from the agent in America, who has glowingly,\r\nand very, very often untruthfully, described.\r\n\r\n“A Southern States bureau of information, such as I suggest for London,\r\nshould be kept entirely free from the machinations of the unscrupulous\r\nland speculator, who, we all know, has in too many cases most seriously\r\ninjured States and localities, simply to gain some small selfish end\r\nof his own. In my opinion the expenses of such a bureau of information\r\nshould be borne by Southern railroad enterprise, and the London bureau\r\nshould work in conjunction with established agencies, or sub-agencies,\r\nin all the large towns and cities in Great Britain, and also be in\r\nclose touch with agencies in the United States, working with the same\r\nobject, viz.: To induce immigration to the Southern States. The South\r\nas it really is can stand on its own merits, and is good enough for\r\nanybody, no matter what class--capitalists, cotton kings, iron masters,\r\ncoal owners, farmers, or earnest, industrious artizans. The South can\r\nsupply every requisite for all, from the raw material to the finished\r\nproduct. These are a few of the facts that people here in England are\r\nignorant of and _should_ be _informed about_, whilst many of your own\r\npeople in the North and Northwest are not much better informed on many\r\npoints. A couple of summers ago I was laughed at at my hotel in New\r\nYork because I remarked, “I cannot stand this sultry heat any longer;\r\nI’LL GO SOUTH, _where it is cooler_.” I was considered a “bullheaded\r\nBritisher;” but I was right, anyhow, for it _was_ cooler in Florence,\r\nAla., than in New York!”\r\n\r\n\r\nA Letter from Western Georgia.\r\n\r\nMr. George W. Truitt, of LaGrange, Ga., one of the most advanced and\r\nsuccessful of the present generation of progressive Georgia farmers,\r\nwrites to the SOUTHERN STATES as follows:\r\n\r\n“Noticing your commendable efforts to advertise the attractions and\r\nresources of the South and induce immigrants to seek homes in this\r\ncountry, I ask space in your columns for a review of some of the\r\ninducements this immediate section offers.\r\n\r\n“This county--Troup--is in Western Georgia with the city of LaGrange as\r\nits county seat.\r\n\r\n“LaGrange has a population of about 4,000 and is beautifully situated,\r\n850 feet above sea level--on the Double Daily mail route from New\r\nYork to New Orleans, and on the new and splendid line from Palatka,\r\nFla., via Macon, Ga., to Birmingham, Ala. For healthfulness it has no\r\nsuperior. It has two of the best female colleges in the South, and\r\nan excellent male high school. The various religious denominations\r\nare represented by nine churches. The town is lighted by electricity\r\nand has a fine system of water works. Two strong banks furnish all\r\nnecessary money for business enterprises. The famous “Terraces” or\r\nTerrell flower gardens are within a mile of the heart of the town.\r\nThere is a $400,000 manufacturing plant here, embracing the LaGrange\r\nCotton Mills, foundry and machine shops, oil mills and guano factory,\r\nall under our management.\r\n\r\n“There are two carriage factories, a plow factory, planing mills,\r\nvariety works and ice factory all inside the city limits. A canning\r\nfactory will soon be erected, and a public school system will be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n“LaGrange is surrounded by one of the best agricultural regions in\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\n“The farm lands are fertile, easily cultivated and yield abundantly\r\nunder intelligent culture. There has not been anything like a failure\r\nof crops in twenty-five years through this section. The climate is all\r\none could wish. Extreme heat and cold are rare. Our lands are rolling,\r\nwith natural drainage; plenty of timber and pure water. Farmers can\r\nwork their lands in half a day after the heaviest rains.\r\n\r\n“The agricultural interest is undergoing a great and rapid change for\r\nthe better. We have abandoned the one-crop idea.\r\n\r\n“Since January 1st, 1894, there has not been sold at this point more\r\nthan one car of Western corn and meat. It has not been many years since\r\nforty cars of those two items were sold in about the same time.\r\n\r\n“Lands here can be bought at a bargain. Our largest land owners see\r\nthe great importance of increasing our white population, and are\r\nin thorough accord and sympathy with any movement looking to an\r\nimprovement in that direction, and stand with open hearts and friendly\r\nhands to welcome a sturdy thrifty class with a little money and plenty\r\nof will and energy.\r\n\r\n“One attraction, of the many worthy of an immigrant’s consideration\r\nin this county, is the fact that the farmer has a home market for his\r\nsurplus farm products. Within a few months from now there will be a\r\ndemand, within a circle of fifteen miles around LaGrange from the\r\ncotton mills already in operation and nearing completion, for 10,000\r\nmore bales of cotton than the county raises; that means 30,000 bales;\r\nwe raise annually about 20,000. Many thousand bales will be sent direct\r\nfrom the fields, as it is gathered, to the factory, where the spot cash\r\nwill be in waiting for the cotton and the seed, the value of the seed\r\namounting to, or adding to the cotton, at least one cent a pound. The\r\nmill operatives furnish a market for thousands of dollars’ worth of the\r\nfarmers’ surplus food products.\r\n\r\n“Clover and grasses grow to perfection here, the Bermuda grass\r\nespecially, which furnishes nine months pasturage and yields\r\nbountifully of a hay second only in nutritive value to the purest\r\ntimothy.\r\n\r\n“Here are some facts and figures from actual experience in farming in\r\nthis vicinity: $96 worth of Bermuda hay from one and a quarter acres;\r\n$60 worth of rust proof oats from one acre; $64 worth of corn from one\r\nacre; 2180 pounds lint cotton (a fine variety) from one acre, sold for\r\n$174.40 and the seed brought $120.\r\n\r\n“We have a farmer in this county who twelve years ago was not worth\r\nover $1000 and who now owns unencumbered property worth over $30,000;\r\nmade it all farming; has never engaged in any other business.\r\n\r\n“The thanks of every Southern man and woman are due you for the service\r\nyou are doing them. And every respectable immigrant who is influenced\r\nby you to seek a home anywhere in this State, I know will not live here\r\nlong before his obligations to you will be expressed.\r\n\r\n“This country and any other will be truly great when the man who pushes\r\nthe plow is landlord of the sod he turns.”\r\n\r\n\r\nInterest in the South Extending.\r\n\r\nA real estate and immigration agent in Iowa writes to the SOUTHERN\r\nSTATES as follows:\r\n\r\n“I have been reading the SOUTHERN STATES, and am deeply interested in\r\nits work. I have been engaged in immigration work myself for thirty\r\nyears, and I readily see some of the difficulties in the way of\r\npromoting immigration to the South. These can be readily overcome. With\r\nthe use of proper methods, there is nothing in the way of bringing\r\nabout a large movement from the Northern States to the South. The\r\npeople of the North are finding it a matter of necessity to change\r\ntheir location, and this matter of moving to the South is of as much\r\ninterest to them as it is to the people of the South. The matter\r\nrests largely with the railroad companies. With proper inducements\r\nand co-operation, agents could be gotten to go through the South on\r\ntours of inspection, whose reports on their return would influence\r\nlarge numbers of families in their communities. They would, of course,\r\nbear their own expenses, but they should have free transportation over\r\nthe railroads. Facilities of this sort should, of course, be extended\r\nonly to men of standing and reputation and influence at home, whose\r\nfavorable report would lead to the removal of numbers of families\r\nin a body. I have taken parties of farmers into the West and the\r\nNorthwest. I am in a position to explain to inquirers every feature of\r\nevery county, for example, in Kansas and Nebraska. It would be easier\r\nto get them to go South; but I am sure of what information to give\r\nconcerning Kansas and Nebraska, while my knowledge of the South is to\r\nsome extent limited. I have a great many inquiries about the South. I\r\nam solicited now by a number of the best farmers of Iowa to go South\r\nand look the country over, get a list of lands for sale, prices, terms,\r\netc., and find out for them what the conditions actually are. There\r\nis great interest in the South, and from all I hear and read it seems\r\nto be infinitely superior as a place for home-seekers to the far West,\r\nbut the railroads and others interested have got to be as liberal in\r\ndeveloping and fostering immigration efforts as the Western railroads\r\nhave been, in order to bring about any extensive movement of this sort.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Hard Times in North Arkansas.\r\n\r\nMr. W. M. Duncan, president of the Citizens Bank, Eureka Springs, Ark.,\r\nwrites to the SOUTHERN STATES as follows:\r\n\r\n“In this section of Arkansas, commonly spoken of as North Arkansas, by\r\nwhich is meant the two northern tiers of counties across the State,\r\nthe financial condition of the farmers is better than at any time\r\nduring the past five years. They are raising increased food supplies,\r\nand yet have very materially decreased their debts and improved their\r\nproperties. Very little cotton is grown north of the Boston mountains;\r\ncorn, oats, rye and sorghum being the chief cereals, while cattle,\r\nhogs and sheep are raised to great advantage and profit. There has\r\nnot been a failure of any crops in the last five years. The outlook\r\nfor the farmers this year is very good, and that of itself makes the\r\ngeneral business situation of the towns and cities in this section most\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\n“The great financial depression through which the country has recently\r\npassed was felt less in this section of the Southwest than in any\r\nother, from all reports. The reason was, our farmers were all well\r\nstocked with fat marketable hogs and cattle, and were able thereby\r\nto quickly realize on the same and meet the calls on them from their\r\nbankers, made necessary by the foolish alarm from lack of confidence so\r\ngenerally experienced in all financial institutions.\r\n\r\n“Our greatest industry, yet very small, fruit raising (especially\r\napples), merits the attention of all persons looking for a location\r\nto engage in apple raising. The apples of North Arkansas have taken\r\nthe first prizes at New Orleans, San Francisco, Boston and the World’s\r\nFair. There are several thousand acres of young apple trees which will\r\nbear the first fruit during the coming year, and as many more trees\r\nhave been planted during the past two years. Our climate is especially\r\nadapted for this.\r\n\r\n“The present status of business with the merchants and general stores\r\nis a great deal better than expected, and by early summer it is\r\nbelieved the return to the customary good trade will be accomplished.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA Strong Disposition to Move South.\r\n\r\nMr. G. B. Randolph, of Anniston, Ala., writes to the SOUTHERN STATES\r\nas follows about his observations on recent trip to the Northwest: “I\r\nmet many farmers and stock-raisers; also small fruit growers. (The\r\nlatter can do but little in that section). I find a strong disposition\r\namong the people there on account of the severe winters and bad roads\r\nto come to a more agreeable climate. This of course is to be expected;\r\npeople will naturally gravitate to a country holding out the greatest\r\ninducements. Here we not only have mild winters but our summers are not\r\nas hot as those in Illinois. A case of sunstroke is unheard of in this\r\nState. Our soil is productive and easily tilled. The character of our\r\nsoil is red clay and sandy loam, and will produce anything that can be\r\nraised in the temperate zone. A great deal of attention is now being\r\nturned to fruit, vineyard and berry culture. Also we are proving this\r\nto be a fine country for tobacco culture. We have a remarkably healthy\r\ncountry. A case of lung trouble I never knew of originating here. As an\r\nindication of the attention being paid to this section, will say that\r\nwithin the past two days I have had inquiries for lands from the States\r\nof New York, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. Will be glad to answer any\r\ninquiries from prospective settlers. We have heretofore been greatly\r\nhandicapped by excessive railroad rates to prospectors and immigrants;\r\nnow I am glad to say the roads are showing a spirit of liberality, and\r\nwe now have excursions the eighth of each month. Round-trip tickets for\r\none fare good for twenty days are being sold by the different lines in\r\nthe North for all points in this section.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPER COMMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yazoo Delta.\r\n\r\nThe Memphis Appeal-Avalanche says: “From present indications the labor\r\nproblem in the Mississippi valley is about to solve itself. The answer\r\nis a simple one--the substitution of white labor for black.\r\n\r\n“Everything seems to indicate that the shiftless, easy-going,\r\ndebt-making negro, dependent all the year round on the man who is\r\nrunning him, will soon be a thing of the past. Of course there are\r\nsome negroes who are exceptions to the rule--who pay their debts\r\nwhen they make them, who live economically, who know the value of a\r\ndollar--but they are few and far between.\r\n\r\n“That the Mississippi Delta is the garden spot of the earth no one\r\ndoubts. Its soil is ever responsive to the hand of the tiller. It is\r\ncapable of raising the most diversified crops. As a cotton country it\r\nhas no equal. All kinds of fruit flourish in its kindly temperature.\r\nThe forest abounds in the most valuable woods. As a stock raising\r\ncountry it is equal to the blue grass region of Kentucky. All that the\r\nDelta needs is the hand of man to develop it, and man is beginning to\r\nrealize that his labor will count for more there than anywhere else.\r\n\r\n“As an example of the difference between Caucasian and negro labor, an\r\ninstance which recently came to light is invaluable. A wealthy planter,\r\nowning a Delta farm, let part of it to some foreign families; the rest\r\nto negroes. The foreigners worked hard. They raised diversified crops.\r\nThey lived as cheap as they could, and at the end of the year they\r\nhad not only paid their rent, but they had their barns stocked with\r\nsupplies and well-filled bank books. The negroes had not paid their\r\nrent and were heavily in debt, besides being dependent on outside help\r\nfor supplies to run them through the year to come. The two classes of\r\ntenants were exactly opposite, the one representing independence, the\r\nother dependency.\r\n\r\n“The Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad, recently purchased by the\r\nIllinois Central system, passes directly through the Delta. It owns a\r\ngreat deal of the land through which it passes, and is now making a\r\nsystematic effort to settle it with immigrants from the Northwest and\r\nEurope. At present a large tract of land, known as the Bogue Phalia\r\ndistrict, is receiving the benefit of most of this effort, and the\r\nfamilies are rapidly moving in and taking possession.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Times-Union, Jacksonville, Fla., utters these profound truths:\r\n“Capital is like Providence in just one respect. It helps those who\r\nhelp themselves. It will take no risks in a community where the people\r\nbrand investments as bad by refusing to take part in them. Capitalists\r\nknow that men everywhere are looking for good investments, and an\r\nenterprise that does not secure home support is presumed to be a\r\nbad investment, no matter how much talk there is for the purpose of\r\nconvincing men to the contrary. The present is an auspicious time.\r\nMillions of dollars of Northern capital are seeking investment, and\r\nthey will go to such places as prove rather than assert faith in the\r\ninvestments they offer.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta Constitution, in making editorial comment on an item in the\r\nSOUTHERN STATES, says:\r\n\r\n“We contend that the South is the most promising section in the Union\r\nfor enterprising farmers who will conduct their business in the right\r\nway. The Northern and Western farmers are beginning to see this. They\r\nare coming to the conclusion that it is short-sighted policy for them\r\nto purchase land at $100 or more per acre when they can buy plenty of\r\ngood farming land in the South at from $5 to $25 per acre. A Northern\r\nfarmer needs at least forty acres, and this will cost him in his own\r\nsection $4000. This sum would buy him at $25 per acre a Southern farm\r\nof 160 acres, but he can easily find good land at much lower figures.\r\nIndeed, with $1500 or $2000 a farm of 150 or 200 acres can be purchased\r\nin a productive region. The Northern farmer who comes South and sticks\r\nto his diversified crop plan will keep out of debt and make money\r\nfrom the start. He will find, too, that he will enjoy here the same\r\nconveniences, facilities, institutions and society that he has always\r\nbeen accustomed to at home. He will suffer none of the drawbacks\r\nof moving to a new country among strangers. Our people are native\r\nAmericans--98 per cent. of them--and the Americans from other sections\r\nwho come here easily assimilate with them, and there is no sectional\r\nprejudice to make it unpleasant for strangers. When an immigrant makes\r\nit apparent that he is a good citizen his Southern neighbors readily\r\nextend the right hand of fellowship without asking him where he hails\r\nfrom.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is the opinion of an editor who moved from Nebraska to Tennessee\r\nand is now editing the Advance of Harriman:\r\n\r\nWe came South from a State as fair as any under the sun. In some\r\nrespects it is unequalled by any land we have ever seen. But that is\r\nnot what makes a country desirable for a life-long, all-the-year-round\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nWith all the desirable qualities of Nebraska, and there is no Northern\r\nState that can excel or even equal it, there are some disadvantages\r\nthat render it more than a hundred per cent. inferior to this country.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there are no minerals, no timber, and,\r\nconsequently, no manufacturing to supply a home market for produce. All\r\nsurplus grain must go to a foreign market, and the distance and freight\r\nare so great, as to leave but very little for the farmer. Corn more\r\nfrequently sells for less than twenty-five cents a bushel than it does\r\nfor more than that, or even that figure.\r\n\r\nThen the long winters and severe blizzards. We know what they are, for\r\nwe battled with them for a good number of years, and are in a position\r\nto judge between the climate of that country and this.\r\n\r\nConcerning the outlook for farming in this country, we are convinced of\r\ntwo facts.\r\n\r\nThe first is, that the same kind of farming given to this Southern soil\r\nthat is given to the the land in the North will result in just as good\r\ncrops. Of this we have no doubt whatever.\r\n\r\nThe second is, that while the farmers of the Northwest have to sell\r\ntheir produce for the lowest possible price, depending entirely on a\r\nforeign market, here, with our stores of undeveloped minerals, and\r\nimmense quantities of timber to be manufactured, the farmer can depend\r\non a good local market for the next hundred years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Age-Herald, Birmingham, Ala., says: “The disposition among Northern\r\nand Northwestern farmers to come South is every day becoming more\r\napparent. They long for the salubrious climate and fertile soil of the\r\nSouth. When the South is covered by small farms owned by industrious\r\nwhite farmers, then it will blossom as the rose. The negro shows a\r\ndisposition to get away from the farm. He is a social creature and\r\nloves the society and excitement of the town. He flocks to the furnaces\r\nand mills around the city. He can stand heat and enjoys the hot work\r\nof the furnaces. He makes more at the public works. He is thriftless\r\nand cannot manage, and can’t make farming pay. It is possible that\r\nthere will be a considerable shifting of places between the whites and\r\nblacks, resulting in good to the entire country.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE NEWSPAPERS SAY OF THE “SOUTHERN STATES.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entire attention of the editor and contributors of this magazine\r\nis devoted to the promotion of the South as a farming region, and to\r\nthe distribution of information which will at once attract immigrants,\r\nshow them where they may with the best advantage locate, and tell\r\nthem what to expect when they arrive. It is an undoubted fact that\r\nmany thousands of acres of land of remarkable productive capacity are\r\ngoing begging for occupants in nearly all of the States south of Mason\r\nand Dixon’s line at very low prices, and it seems to be the case that\r\nthe Northern or Eastern farmer of thrifty, economical and industrial\r\nhabits and with a practical knowledge of his business will not fail\r\nto succeed in the South. “The South and Immigration” is the first\r\narticle in the present issue, and it consists of letters from prominent\r\nrailroad officials, showing the aids which are extended to immigrants\r\nby these organizations. The next paper is made up of letters from\r\nSouthern banking institutions whose universal testimony it is that a\r\nsteadily increasing financial prosperity is in progress throughout\r\nthese States, and the “Letters from Northern and Western Farmers Giving\r\nTheir Experience in the South” tend to prove the same statement. This\r\nmagazine is serving as the medium for the carrying on of an enormous\r\nand an invaluable work.--Boston Herald.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a just and true mirror of the Southern country and an invaluable\r\naid in its upbuilding and advertisement. The ignorance of the world\r\nconcerning all things Southern is astonishing, and is fostered and\r\nincreased by immigration agents and land companies by wilful and absurd\r\nmisrepresentation concerning its people, its climate, its methods\r\nand everything connected with it viewed as a home for prospective\r\nsettlers. Until recently the South has had no champion against this\r\nmaligning. To combat these errors and let the world know the truth is\r\nthe mission of the SOUTHERN STATES, and the steadily increasing influx\r\nof immigrants to this portion of the Union is in a great measure due to\r\nits intelligent and unceasing efforts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe SOUTHERN STATES is devoting itself to a remarkable degree\r\nto illustrating the attractions of the South for farmers and\r\nmanufacturers, and to this end is printing in its monthly numbers\r\nletters from farmers and railway managers throughout that section of\r\nthe country, who show what the possibilities are in dealing with the\r\nsoil and in gaining access to the markets of the nation. The forces\r\nof immigration have been chiefly directed to the North and West until\r\na large portion of that country has been occupied; but the industrial\r\nresources of the South have only just been touched, not developed, and\r\nthe railways are calling loudly for people who are ready to immigrate\r\nto different parts of the South and purchase small farms. At the same\r\ntime a large number of the farmers give an account of their actual\r\nexperience in the different Southern States as agriculturists.--Boston\r\nHerald.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe SOUTHERN STATES should meet with substantial endorsement from every\r\nSoutherner interested in the upbuilding of his section.--Commercial,\r\nUnion City, Tenn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Wm.

Mr. Edmonds is now\r\nengaged in a work thoroughly congenial to him, the main object of the\r\nSOUTHERN STATES magazine being identical with that he had mapped out\r\nfor the Telegram when he purchased the paper.
