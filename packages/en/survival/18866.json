When the tiller is amidships the valve handle, H, is at right\r\nangles to the cylinder, and parallel to the tiller. By moving the\r\nlever, H, to right or left, steam is admitted to one end or the other\r\nof the cylinder, which, acting on the tiller through the piston,\r\npiston rod, and crosshead, moves the rudder; and when the rudder\r\nreaches the desired position the cut-off will have been moved the\r\namount necessary to prevent further entrance of steam. When the rudder\r\nis influenced by the waves or by the expansion or contraction of\r\nsteam, the cut-off alters its position in relation to the valve and\r\nautomatically arranges the steam passages so that the piston is\r\nreturned to its proper position. The details of the cut-off are shown\r\nin Fig. 2; the valve, G, which covers the cut-off, F, acts like a four\r\nway cock. The spindle of the cut-off, F, is connected with the lever,\r\nI, and is moved by the rudder, as already described. By enlarging or\r\ngradually narrowing the ends of the steam ports great rigidity or\r\nelasticity may be given to the hold of this engine, according to the\r\nrequirements of the particular vessel.\r\n\r\nFew and simple as are the parts of this machine it is possible, by\r\nbalancing the valves and suiting the diameter of the cylinder to the\r\nwork to be performed, to overcome great resistances with a slight\r\neffort. The inventor says that this system of valves is considered by\r\nexperts to be novel and very valuable.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 3 is shown a pattern of a slide valve suited to special\r\npurposes. Its working is essentially the same as that of the valve\r\nalready described. The ports are set side by side, parallel with the\r\nsides of the valve. The supply port is in the middle, the other ports\r\nlead to opposite ends of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 4 is shown another application of the controlling valve and\r\ncut-off described above. Two oscillating steam cylinders are employed\r\nin working the rudder. They are placed on opposite sides of the chest,\r\nA, and are supplied with steam through the controlling valve, B. The\r\npiston rods of the two cylinders are connected with cranks placed on\r\nopposite ends of the shaft, C, at right angles to each other. Upon\r\nthis shaft, half-way between the pillow blocks which support it, there\r\nis a worm which engages a toothed sector, D, on the rudder-post, E. To\r\nan extension of the rudder-post is secured an arm, F, which is\r\nconnected with the arm, G, of the controlling valve. By shifting the\r\nlever, H, the supply of steam to the two cylinders may be increased or\r\ndiminished, or its direction may be changed, so that the engines will\r\nbe reversed or stopped. This engine is remarkable for its simplicity.\r\nThe cylinders may be detached and changed if required, one size of bed\r\nanswering for three different sizes of cylinder, which may vary only\r\nin diameter, the stroke being the same, so that the castings for\r\nengines of different power are the same except in the matter of the\r\ncylinders and pistons, and all the parts are interchangeable--a\r\nfeature of modern engine building that cannot be too highly valued.\r\n\r\nFurther information may be obtained from Herbert Wadsworth, 26\r\nMerchants' Bank Building, 28 State street, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW OUR PATENT LAWS PROMOTE AND IMPROVE AMERICAN INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn another page we print in full a most suggestive paper recently\r\nread before the Manchester (Eng.) Scientific and Mechanical Society,\r\nby Mr. Frederick Smith, a prominent builder of that city, contrasting\r\nthe qualities, styles, and prices of American and English builders'\r\nhardware--a paper which the _Ironmonger_ pronounces one of the most\r\nserious indictments yet preferred against British workmanship in that\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nThe field covered by the paper--the supplying of house builders'\r\nhardware--embraces a multitude of conveniences, but no real\r\nnecessities. Why is it that America has been prolific in novel devices\r\nand clever improvements in this department of manufacture as in so\r\nmany others, while England has gone on stolidly copying ancient forms,\r\nchanging only to cheapen by the introduction of poor material and sham\r\nconstruction? Mr. Smith mentions several reasons that English\r\nmanufacturers have given him for the state of things he, as an\r\nEnglishman, so greatly deplores; but evidently he is not satisfied\r\nwith any of them, and very justly; for none of them touches the real\r\ncause--the radically different attitude of the public mind toward\r\ninventions, characteristic of the two countries.\r\n\r\nIn England the user of household inconveniences accepts them as\r\nmatters of fact; or if he grumbles at them he never thinks of trying\r\nto change them. It is not his business; and if he should devise an\r\nimprovement, ten to one he could not get it made. To patent it is\r\npractically out of the question, for if it were not condemned off-hand\r\nas trivial, the patent fees would make it cost more than it was likely\r\nto be worth. The mechanic who makes such things is trained to work to\r\npattern, and not waste his time on experiments. Besides, if he should\r\nmake a clever invention he would not be able to raise the necessary\r\nfees for a patent, or to get any one to help him thereto. The\r\nmanufacturer \"makes what his customers call for.\" Why should he spend\r\nhis money and spoil his plant to introduce improvements? So things go,\r\nuntil some pestilent Yankees flood the markets with better articles at\r\na lower price; and British consumers suddenly discover that they want\r\nsomething that the native manufacturer cannot make. The need was\r\nthere; but invention did not follow. How happened it that the American\r\nmanufacturer did not pursue the same uninventive course? What produced\r\nthe radically different attitude of the American mind toward\r\nnewfangled notions out of which inventions proceeded and flourished?\r\n\r\nNo doubt several causes have been at work: freedom of thought and\r\naction; popular education; a blending of races; and the tide of\r\nadventurous spirits naturally resorting to a new and free land. These\r\nhave had their influence undoubtedly; but all these have existed, more\r\nor less completely, in other new lands, without that outburst of\r\ncreative energy which has made America the nursery of inventions,\r\ngreat and small. The determining cause, the one condition that\r\nprevailed here and not elsewhere, was the circumstance that almost\r\nfrom the start new ideas were given a market value in this country.\r\nUnlike all others, the American patent law directly encouraged\r\nindependent thinking in all classes. The fees were low and the\r\nprotection offered fairly good. Men soon found that it paid to invent;\r\nthat one of the surest roads to competency was a patented improvement\r\non something of general use. If a household utensil or appliance went\r\nwrong or worked badly, every user was directly interested in devising\r\nsomething better; and, more than that, he was interested in making his\r\ninvention known and in securing its adoption. The workman at his bench\r\nhad an ever-present inducement to contrive something at once cheaper\r\nand better than the article he was hired to make. He could patent his\r\nimprovement, or the wholly original device he might hit upon, for a\r\nfew dollars; and his patent would count as capital. It would make him\r\nhis own master, possibly bring him a fortune. The manufacturer could\r\nnot rest contented with the thing he set out to make, for the meanest\r\nhired man in his employ might suddenly become a competitor. He must be\r\nconstantly alert for possible improvements, or his rivals would get\r\nahead of him. The result is a nation of inventors, at whose hands the\r\nnewest of lands has leaped to the leadership in the arts, almost at a\r\nbound.\r\n\r\nThere is talk of changing all this; of emulating the conservative\r\nspirit of the Old World; of putting inventors under bonds; of stopping\r\nthe rush of industrial improvement--to enable a few short-sighted yet\r\ngrasping corporations to get along without paying license fees for\r\nsuch inventions as they happen to approve of. They profess to want\r\ninventors to go on making improvements. They are willing to ascribe\r\nall honor to the successful inventor; but they are determined not to\r\npay him for his work. Still more they are determined to change the\r\nattitude of the public mind toward inventors and inventions, if such a\r\nchange can be wrought by plausible misrepresentations. The fact that\r\nthey were able to inveigle one branch of the American Congress into\r\nassenting to their unjust and mischievous scheme is one of the\r\nanomalies of our recent history. It should be taken as a timely\r\nwarning of impending danger to all the industrial interests of the\r\ncountry. It is outrageous that the inventors of the land, after having\r\nraised their country to the first rank among industrial nations,\r\nshould have to defend their constitutional rights against\r\nCongressional invasion; but the fact exists; and the defense should be\r\nmade a matter of personal interest and effort not only by every\r\ninventor and manufacturer, but by every honest citizen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURO-PNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cattle plague, which is creating so much anxiety throughout the\r\nEastern States, is a contagious fever, affecting cows chiefly,\r\ncharacterized by extensive exudations into the respiratory organs, and\r\nattended by a low typhus inflammation of the lungs, pluræ, and\r\nbronchia. It has prevailed in Europe for ages, at times developing\r\ninto wide-spread scourges, causing incalculable loss. It was imported\r\ninto England in 1839, and again three years later; and it was\r\nestimated that within twenty-five years thereafter the losses by\r\ndeaths alone in England had amounted to $450,000,000. In 1858 the\r\ndisease was carried to Australia by an English cow, and, spreading to\r\nthe cattle ranges, almost depopulated them.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 an infected Dutch cow brought the disease to Brooklyn, where\r\nit has since lingered, slowly spreading among the cattle in Kings and\r\nQueens counties. In 1847 several head of infected English cattle were\r\nimported into New Jersey, and, spreading among a herd of valuable\r\ncattle, made it necessary for them all to be slaughtered, the only\r\ncertain method of stamping out the disease. In 1859 four infected cows\r\nwere imported into Massachusetts from Holland; the plague spread\r\nrapidly, and was stamped out only by persistent effort, the State\r\npaying for over 1,000 slaughtered cattle. Since 1867 the disease has\r\nnot been known there. Meantime the pest had invaded Eastern\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, where it has since prevailed in\r\nisolated localities. The absence of large herds of moving cattle in\r\nthese districts, except for speedy slaughter, has prevented the\r\ndisease from developing into a general plague.\r\n\r\nThe recent action of the British Council in forbidding the importation\r\nof American live cattle is likely to prove of inestimable benefit to\r\nthis country, in forcibly calling attention to the grave risk that the\r\npresence of the disease on Long Island and elsewhere constantly\r\nentails. Fortunately the drift of the cattle traffic is eastward, and\r\nas yet there has been no propagation of the poison in the great cattle\r\nranges of the West. Unless summarily arrested, however, the disease\r\nwill surely reach those sources of our cattle supply, and occasion\r\nlosses that can be estimated only in hundreds of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe experience of all countries into which this disease has gained\r\naccess appears to prove that there is only one way of getting rid of\r\nit--namely, the immediate killing of all infected cattle, and the\r\nthorough disinfection of the premises in which they are found.\r\n\r\nThe disease is purely infectious, and is never found in regions where\r\nit has not gained a foothold by importation. Palliative measures have\r\nin every instance failed to eradicate the disease, and are only\r\njustifiable, as in Australia, after the plague has reached dimensions\r\nutterly beyond the reach of any process of extermination.\r\n\r\nProfessor Law, of Cornell University, one of our best informed\r\nveterinary surgeons, most emphatically opposes every attempt to\r\ncontrol the disease by quarantining the sick or by the inoculation of\r\nthe healthy. \"We may quarantine the sick,\" he says, \"but we cannot\r\nquarantine the air.\" To establish quarantine yards is simply to\r\nmaintain prolific manufacturers of the poison, which is given off by\r\nthe breath of the sick, and by their excretions, to such an extent\r\nthat no watchfulness can insure against its dissemination. Besides,\r\nthe expense of thorough quarantining operations would amount to more\r\nthan the value of the infected animals whose lives might be saved\r\nthereby. Inoculation is still less to be tolerated at this stage of\r\nthe pest.\r\n\r\nThe Professor says: \"Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, and England,\r\nhave been treating the victims of this plague for nearly half a\r\ncentury, but the result has only been the increase of disease and\r\ndeath. Our own infected States have been treating it for a third of a\r\ncentury, and to-day it exists over a wider area than ever before.\r\nContrast this with the results in Massachusetts and Connecticut, where\r\nthe disease has been repeatedly crushed out at small expense, and\r\nthere can be no doubt as to which is the wisest course. As all the\r\nplagues are alike in the propagation of the poison in the bodies of\r\nthe sick, I may be allowed to adduce the experience of two adjacent\r\ncounties in Scotland when invaded by the rinderpest. Aberdeen raised a\r\nfund of £2,000, and though she suffered several successive\r\ninvasions, she speedily crushed out the poison wherever it appeared by\r\nslaughtering the sick beasts and disinfecting the premises. The result\r\nwas that little more than half the fund was wanted to reimburse the\r\nowners for their losses, and the splendid herds of the county were\r\npreserved. Forfar, on the other hand, set herself to cure the plague,\r\nwith the result of a universal infection, the loss of many thousands\r\nof cattle, and the ruin of hundreds of farmers. Finally the malady was\r\ncrushed out in the entire island by the method adopted by Aberdeen and\r\nother well advised counties at the outset.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, \"Cattle have been inoculated by the tens of thousands in\r\nBelgium and Holland, and of all Europe these are the countries now\r\nmost extensively infected. France, Prussia, Italy, Austria, and\r\nEngland have each practiced it on a large scale, and each remains a\r\nhome of the plague. Australia has followed the practice, and is now\r\nand must continue an infected country. Our own infected States have\r\ninoculated, and the disease has survived and spread in spite of it,\r\nand even by its aid. Whatever country has definitively exterminated\r\nthe plague (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holstein, Mecklenburg,\r\nSwitzerland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut), that country has\r\nprohibited inoculation and all other methods that prevail on the\r\nprinciple of preserving the sick, and has relied on the slaughter of\r\nthe infected and the thorough disinfection of their surroundings. So\r\nwill it be with us. If any State adopts or allows any of these\r\ntemporizing measures, that State will only repeat the experience of\r\nthe past alike in the Old World and the New, will perpetuate the\r\ndisease in the country, will entail great losses on its citizens, will\r\nkeep up the need for constant watchfulness and great expense by the\r\nadjoining States for their own protection, and will indefinitely\r\npostpone the resumption of the foreign live stock trade, which, a few\r\nmonths ago, promised to be one of the most valuable branches of our\r\ninternational commerce.\"\r\n\r\nWe are persuaded that the position taken by Professor Law, and other\r\nsimilar-minded veterinary surgeons, is the only safe one. The disease\r\ncan be stamped out now with comparatively small loss. If trifled with,\r\nand tolerated, it cannot but result in a great national calamity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN A FIELD FOR MACHINERY AND PATENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a too lengthy communication to admit in full to our columns, a\r\nresident of Madrid communicates to the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN some facts\r\nrelative to the fertility of the soil of Spain, her necessity for\r\nimproved agricultural and other implements, and closes with the\r\nassertion that it is a good field withal for patents. We cull from the\r\nletter as follows:\r\n\r\nI have lived, says the writer, for a number of years in this beautiful\r\ncountry, so little understood by foreigners, so little appreciated by\r\nits own inhabitants. The Spain of romance, poetry, and song, is the\r\ngarden as well as the California of Europe. But it stands in great\r\nneed of the health-giving touch of the North American enterprise. We\r\nhave here the same mineral treasures, the same unrivaled advantages of\r\nclimate, that made Spain once the industrial and commercial emporium\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nBut Spain is awakening. She is endeavoring to shake off her lethargy.\r\nThe late Exhibition of Paris has proved this; and those who are\r\nfamiliar with the past history and present condition of Spain have\r\nbeen astonished at the result of this effort. A new era has commenced\r\nfor the country, and it is everywhere evident that a strong current of\r\nenterprise and industry has set in. But it is with nations, as with\r\nindividuals, when they have remained long in complete inaction, brain\r\nand muscles are torpid and cannot at first obey the will. Spain needs\r\nthe assistance of other nations hardened and inured to toil.\r\n\r\nThe plows now used to till the land are precisely such as were those\r\nleft by the Moors in the unfinished furrow, when with tears and sighs\r\nthey bade farewell to their broad fields, their mosques and palaces,\r\nwhose ideal architecture is still the wonder of the world, to go forth\r\nas outcasts and exiles in obedience to the cruel edict that drove them\r\naway to the deserts of Africa.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether there is an American plow in Spain, much less a steam\r\nplow. Sowing and reaping machines are here unknown, and grain is tread\r\nout by oxen and mules just as it was in Scripture times, and cleaned\r\nby women, who toss it in the air to scatter the chaff. Everything is\r\nprimitive and Oriental here as yet.\r\n\r\nSpain could supply all Europe with butter and cheese, and, on the\r\ncontrary, these articles are imported in large quantities from\r\nEngland, Holland, and Switzerland. The traveler crosses leagues and\r\nleagues of meadow land where not a tree is to be seen, nor one sheep\r\npasture, and which are nevertheless watered by broad rivers that carry\r\naway to the ocean the water that would, by irrigation, convert these\r\nfields into productive farms. There are many places in Spain where the\r\nwine is thrown away for want of purchasers and vats in which to keep\r\nit. In the Upper Aragon, the mortar with which the houses are built is\r\nmade with wine instead of water, the former being the most plentiful.\r\nAragon needs an enterprising American company to convert into\r\nwholesome table wine the infinite varieties there produced, and which\r\nour neighbors the French buy and carry away to convert into Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nWe want American enterprise in Galicia and Asturias, where milk is\r\nalmost given away, to convert it into the best of butter and cheese;\r\nand also in those same provinces, where delicious fruit is grown in\r\nsuch abundance that it is left on the ground for the swine.\r\n\r\nSpain needs many more railroads and canals, all of which, when\r\nconstructed, are subsidized by the government; the railroads at the\r\nrate of $12,000 a kilometer, and many more additional advantages are\r\noffered for canals.\r\n\r\nWith regard to commerce with Spain, we have to lament the same\r\nindifference on the part of the Americans. I have, for instance, an\r\nAmerican double-burner petroleum lamp. All who see it admire and covet\r\nit, but they are not to be had here. If we except one American in\r\nMadrid, who brings mostly pumps and similar articles on a very small\r\nscale, we have no dealers in American goods here. Wooden clothes pins,\r\nlemon squeezers, clothes horses, potato peelers, and the hundreds of\r\ndomestic appliances of American invention, elsewhere considered\r\nindispensable, are in Spain unknown.\r\n\r\nWe had confidently expected that the new Spanish law on patents would\r\ndraw the attention of American inventors toward this country, that\r\nto-day offers a wide field for every new practical invention, but I am\r\nsorry to see that, with the exception of Edison and a few others, the\r\nAmericans have not yet availed themselves of the easy facility for\r\ntaking patents for Spain, where new inventions and new industries are\r\nnow eagerly accepted and adopted. And while the Americans are thus\r\ncareless as to their own interests, the French take out and negotiate,\r\nin Spain, American patents with insignificant variations.\r\n\r\nLet American inventors be assured that any new invention, useful and\r\npractical, and above all, requiring but little capital to establish it\r\nas an industry, will find a ready sale in Spain.\r\n\r\nI could enlarge to a much greater extent upon the indifference of\r\nAmerican inventors, merchants, manufacturers, and business men, as to\r\nthe market they have in Spain in their respective lines, and upon the\r\nimportance of building up a trade with this country, but to do so\r\nwould require more space than I think you would feel justified in\r\noccupying in your columns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER COOPER AS AN INVENTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe successes of Peter Cooper's long and useful life are well known.\r\nNot so many are aware of his varied experience in the direction of\r\nfailure, particularly in the field of invention. More than once he has\r\nfound his best devices profitless because ahead of his time, or\r\nbecause of conditions, political or otherwise, which no one could\r\nforesee. He possessed the rare qualities, however, of pluck and\r\nperseverance, and when one thing failed he lost no time in trying\r\nsomething else. Before he was of age he had learned three trades--and\r\nhe did not make his fortune at either.\r\n\r\nIn a familiar conversation with a _Herald_ writer recently, Mr. Cooper\r\nrelated some of his early experiences, particularly with reference to\r\nenterprises which did not succeed. His father was a hatter, and as a\r\nboy young Cooper learned how to make a hat in all its parts. The\r\nfather was not successful in business, and the hatter's trade seems to\r\nhave offered little encouragement to the son. Accordingly he learned\r\nthe art of making ale. Why he did not stick to that calling and become\r\na millionaire brewer, Mr. Cooper does not say. Most probably the\r\nnational taste for stronger tipple could not at that time be overcome,\r\nand ale could not compete with New England rum and apple-jack. The\r\nyoung mechanic next essayed the art of coachmaking, at which he served\r\na full apprenticeship. At the end of his time his employer offered to\r\nset him up in business, but the offer was not accepted, through fear\r\nof losing another's money. He felt that if he took the money and lost\r\nit he would have to be a slave for life. So he quit coachmaking and\r\nwent to work for a man at Hempstead, L. I., making machines for\r\nshearing cloth. In three years, on $1.50 a day, Cooper had saved\r\nenough money to buy his employer's patent. Immediately he introduced\r\nimprovements in the manufacture and in the machine, which the war with\r\nEngland made a great demand for by excluding foreign cloths. At this\r\ntime Cooper married. In due time the family numbered three, and the\r\nyoung father's inventive faculty was again called upon.\r\n\r\n\"In those days,\" said Mr. Cooper to the reporter, smiling as the\r\nremembrance came to his mind, \"we kept no servants as they do\r\nnowadays, and my wife and myself had to do all that was to be done.\r\nAfter our first child was born I used to come into the house and find\r\nmy wife rocking the cradle, and I relieved her from that while I was\r\nthere. After doing that for a few days I thought to myself that I\r\ncould make that thing go of itself. So I went into my shop, and made a\r\npendulous cradle that would rock the child. Then I attached a musical\r\ninstrument which would sing for it, and at the same time the machine\r\nwould keep the flies off. The latter was very simple; by hanging\r\nsomething to the cross bar, as the cradle swung under it, backward and\r\nforward, it would create wind enough to drive away the flies. The\r\nmachine was wound up by a weight, and would run for nearly half an\r\nhour without stopping. I took out a patent for it, and one day a\r\npeddler came along with a horse and wagon, as they do in the country,\r\nand saw the cradle. He struck a bargain with me and bought the patent\r\nright for the State of Connecticut, giving for it his horse and wagon\r\nand all the goods he had with him. They afterward made some there, but\r\nnothing like as good as mine. It was a beautiful piece of furniture,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Cooper regretfully, as he thought of it as a thing of the\r\npast. \"They afterward substituted springs for the weight movement, but\r\nthat kind was not so good.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time the war with England ended and the market was spoiled\r\nfor the shearing machines. Then, we believe, Mr. Cooper tried his hand\r\nat cabinetmaking, but that failed, and he set up a grocery store where\r\nthe Bible House now stands. While selling groceries Mr. Cooper made an\r\ninvention which ought to have made his fortune, but it did not. The\r\nstory is best told in Mr. Cooper's own words:\r\n\r\n\"It was just before the Erie Canal was completed, and I conceived a\r\nplan by which to tow boats by the use of all the elevated waters on\r\nthe line of the canal. To demonstrate that that was practicable I made\r\nwith my own hands a chain two miles long, and placed posts 200 feet\r\napart in the East River from Bellevue dock down town about a mile.\r\nThese posts supported grooved wheels to lay the chain in, forming an\r\nendless chain. The whole was moved by an overshot waterwheel placed at\r\nthe Bellevue dock. A reservoir twelve feet square and three deep held\r\nthe water to turn the wheel.\"\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Governor Clinton Mr. Cooper tightened his chain\r\nand pulled up the end post just before the grand trial of his device\r\nwas to come off. He succeeded in getting stone enough to anchor the\r\npost, however, and the experiment went off swimmingly. The boat was\r\nhooked on to the chain, and the passage back and forward--two\r\nmiles--was made in eleven minutes.\r\n\r\n\"I ran that boat some ten days,\" says Mr. Cooper, \"to let people see\r\nwhat could be done, and carried nearly a thousand people. Part of the\r\ntime I ran two boats. Once I counted 52 people in one boat. I made the\r\nwhole chain myself and planted the posts. As I could find no wheels to\r\nsuit me I made the moulds and cast the wheels myself out of block tin\r\nand zinc. It was no small job, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\nThis was unquestionably a grand invention. In itself it was a perfect\r\nsuccess; but it was not used. Mr. Cooper tells why:\r\n\r\n\"It demonstrated completely that the elevated water power along the\r\nline of the canal and every lock in the canal could be made use of to\r\ndrive the boats. Governor Clinton gave me $800 for the privilege of\r\nbuying the right to the plan in case he should want to use it on the\r\nErie Canal. In making the canal he had promised the people along the\r\nroute that as soon as it was finished they could sell their horses to\r\ntow the boats, their grain and fodder to feed the horses, and their\r\nprovisions for the passengers. On reflection he thought that if he\r\ntook all that away from them he would have to run the gantlet again,\r\nand he could not afford to do that. There never was anything done with\r\nthe plan until a few years ago, when Mr. Welch, president of the\r\nCamden and Amboy Railroad and Canal, invented exactly the same thing\r\nand put it in practice on his locks on the canal. He found it saved\r\nhalf the time and great expense. He went to Washington to take out a\r\npatent for it, and when he got there he found that I had patented the\r\nsame thing fifty-three years before. My patent had run out, so he\r\ncould use the plan on his canal. It has also been used on one lock on\r\nthe Erie Canal. If they could have used that chain on the whole length\r\nof the Erie Canal it would have saved many millions of dollars.\"\r\n\r\nThis would not be a bad place, were there room for it, to speak of\r\n\"undeveloped\" and therefore worthless inventions; and the assumption\r\nthat if an inventor does not make his invention immediately profitable\r\nit must be good for nothing, and should be dispatented. But the moral\r\ngoes without telling.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper's next attempt at invention was made about the same time,\r\nbut in quite a different direction. It was during the struggle of the\r\nGreeks for independence, and wishing to do something for their\r\nassistance, Mr. Cooper undertook to make a torpedo boat for them. Mr.\r\nCooper says:\r\n\r\n\"It was a small one that could be taken on board ship and used to\r\ndestroy any vessel that came to destroy them. It was fixed with a\r\nrotary steam engine and a screw wheel to propel it. It was intended to\r\nbe guided from the ship or the shore. There were two steel wires fixed\r\nto the tiller of the rudder, and the operator could pull on one side\r\nor the other and guide the vessel just as a horse is guided with\r\nreins. It was so arranged that at night it would carry a light with\r\nits dark side toward the object to be destroyed, and by simply keeping\r\nthe light in range with the vessel it would be sure to hit it. The\r\ntorpedo was carried on a little iron rod, projecting in front of the\r\ntorpedo vessel a few inches under water. Contact would discharge the\r\ntorpedo and bend this iron rod. This would reverse the action of the\r\nengine and cause the torpedo vessel to return right back from whence\r\nit came, ready to carry another torpedo.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the torpedo boat was not ready in time to go with the\r\nship carrying the contributions for Greece. It was stored in Mr.\r\nCooper's factory (he had then turned his attention to glue) and was\r\ndestroyed by the burning of the factory. It seems to have been quite a\r\npromising affair for the time. Mr. Cooper says:\r\n\r\n\"I experimented with it at once to see how far it could be guided. I\r\nmade a steel wire ten miles long and went down to the Narrows to test\r\nthe matter. I had steel yards fastened to one end of the wire, and to\r\nthe other end the torpedo vessel as attached. It got about six miles\r\naway when a vessel coming into the harbor crossed the wire and broke\r\nit. Although the experiment was not complete it showed that for at\r\nleast six miles I could guide the vessel as easily as I could guide a\r\nhorse.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper's work as the pioneer locomotive builder in this country;\r\nhis later inventions and improvements in the manufacture of railway\r\niron and wrought iron beams for fireproof buildings; his application\r\nof anthracite coal to iron puddling, and his other successes are\r\nalmost as widely known as his philanthropic efforts for the education\r\nand advancement of the industrial classes of this city.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we are not sure but the story of his long and varied and\r\nalways honorable career, told by himself, would not be worth, to young\r\npeople who have to make their way in life through many difficulties,\r\nmore even than the advantages of the noble institution which bears his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTASTE FOR READING.--Sir John Herschel has declared that \"if he were to\r\npray for a taste which should stand under every variety of\r\ncircumstance and be a source of happiness and cheerfulness to him\r\nthrough life, it would be a taste for reading.\" Give a man, he\r\naffirms, that taste, and the means of gratifying it, and you cannot\r\nfail of making him good and happy; for you bring him in contact with\r\nthe best society in all ages, with the tenderest, the bravest, and the\r\npurest men who have adorned humanity, making him a denizen of all\r\nnations, a contemporary of all times, and giving him a practical proof\r\nthat the world has been created for him, for his solace, and for his\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRICA CROSSED AGAIN.\r\n\r\nInformation has been received by way of Lisbon, March 12, that the\r\nPortuguese explorer, Pinto, has succeeded in traversing Africa from\r\nwest to east, and has reached Transvaal.

A. Seeley\r\nmade the following remarks: The article claims that Mr. Gary has made\r\na discovery of a neutral line or surface, at which the polarity of an\r\ninduced magnet, while moving in the field of the inducing pole, is\r\nchanged. The alleged discovery appears to be an exaggerated statement\r\nof some curious facts, which, although not new, are not commonly\r\nrecognized. If a bar of iron be brought up, end on, near a magnetic\r\npole, the bar becomes an induced magnet, but an induced magnet quite\r\ndifferent from what our elementary treatises seem to predict. On the\r\nfirst scrutiny it is a magnet without a neutral point, and only one\r\nkind of magnetism--namely, that of the inducing pole. Moreover, the\r\nsingle pole is pretty evenly distributed over the whole surface, so\r\nthat if iron filings be sprinkled on the bar they will be attracted at\r\nall points and completely cover it. Now, if while the bar is covered\r\nby filings it be moved away from the inducing pole, the filings will\r\ngradually and progressively fall, beginning at the end nearest the\r\ninducing pole and continuing to some point near the middle of the bar;\r\nthe filings at the remote end will generally be held permanently. When\r\nthe bar is carried beyond the field of the inducing pole it is simply\r\na weak magnet of ordinary properties--_i. e._, of two poles and a\r\nneutral point between them.\r\n\r\nA plausible and simple explanation of this case is that the inducing\r\npole holds or binds the induced magnetism of opposite name, so that it\r\nhas no external influence; the two magnetisms are related to each\r\nother as are the positive and negative electricities of the Leyden\r\njar. Let the inducing pole be N.; the S. of the bar will be attracted\r\nby it and bound, while the N. of the bar becomes abnormally free and\r\nactive. On moving the bar from the pole the bound magnetism is\r\nreleased and a part becomes residual magnetism. Now when the residual\r\nbalances the free magnetism which is of opposite name, we are on\r\nGary's neutral line. In a restricted sense there is a change of\r\npolarity over the half of the bar contiguous to the inducing pole; on\r\nthe other half there is no change of pole in any sense. Experiment\r\nwith a shingle nail in the place of the filings, _à la_ Gary,\r\nbring the nail to the induced bound pole, and it may be held, except\r\nat the neutral line. Now if one will read the magazine article with\r\nsuch ideas as these he will feel pretty sure that the writer of it has\r\nused words recklessly, that Gary has not made an original discovery,\r\nand that the \"neutral\" line, whatever it be, has only an imagined\r\nrelation to the \"principle\" of the motor.\r\n\r\nThe Gary Motor as a perpetual motion scheme, of course, is not worthy\r\nof serious notice from a society devoted to science. It has no\r\nnoteworthy novelty of construction or conception. Mr. Gary is\r\nafflicted with the very old delusion of the cut-off or shield of\r\nmagnetism, which is to cost less than what comes from it. His cut-off\r\nis a sheet of iron, which we know acts simply as an armature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW PHENOMENON IN STATICAL ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. E. Duter, in a paper read before the French Academy in December,\r\nshowed that when a Leyden jar is charged with either positive or\r\nnegative electricity its internal volume increases, and that this\r\neffect is a new phenomenon, unexplainable by either a theory of an\r\nincrease of temperature or of an electrical pressure. The experiment\r\nwas performed by means of a flask-shaped Leyden jar with a long tube\r\nattached to its neck, and containing a liquid which served as the\r\ninner armature. The author's attention had been called to the fact\r\nthat this phenomenon had been observed ten years ago by M. Gori.\r\n\r\nHis researches, just made public, leave no doubt of the accuracy of M.\r\nDuter's view, that the glass of the jar really expands. According to\r\nthe theory of elasticity, the effect of an internal pressure in a\r\nhollow sphere is in the inverse ratio of its thickness. M. Duter,\r\ntherefore, had three flasks made of the same volume, but of\r\nthicknesses of 4 mm., 0.8 mm., and 0.5 mm. respectively. They were\r\nfilled with water and enveloped by tin foil. Each carried a capillary\r\nthermometer tube, in which the variations of the height of liquid\r\nserved to measure the changes in volume due to electrification. He\r\nfound that these changes were imperceptible in the thick glass, very\r\nmarked in the flask of mean thickness, and rose to 30 mm. in the\r\nthinnest. The variations in volume were very nearly in inverse ratio\r\nof the square roots of the thicknesses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW ORE CRUSHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engravings represent an improved ore crusher, which\r\nis said to be very effective and economical in the use of power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--BROWN'S ORE CRUSHER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--HORIZONTAL SECTION.]\r\n\r\nA short vertical cast iron cylinder, A, having in one side a discharge\r\nopening, H, contains all of the movable parts.\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of the cylinder is lined with chilled iron plates,\r\nL, and an inclined chute, X, leads to the discharge opening, H.\r\n\r\nA rigid shaft, B, carries the circular crusher, C, and moves in a ball\r\nand socket joint at the upper end, and extends eccentrically through\r\nthe boss of a bevel wheel, G, at its lower end, and rests on a step\r\nsupported by a lever that may be adjusted by the screw, R.

A blow upon the knob at the top\r\nof the plunger forces the chisel-pointed rods through holes in the\r\ncasing into the meat, the casing resting on the surface of the steak.\r\n\r\nMessrs. A. W. Southard and Volney R. Sears, of Falls City, Neb., have\r\npatented an improved invalid bedstead, which is provided with\r\ningenious mechanism for placing the invalid in different positions.\r\n\r\nAn improved spring attachment for carriage tops, which is designed to\r\nprevent the rear bow from being bent by the weight of the top when\r\nturned back, has been patented by Mr. Robert E. McCormick, of\r\nDoylestown, O.\r\n\r\nMr. Espy Gallipher, of Schellsburg, Pa., has devised an axle journal\r\nhaving a groove lengthwise upon its upper side which extends back upon\r\nthe surface of the axle and communicates with an oil cup. A sliding\r\nrod occupies a portion of the groove; when this rod is drawn out it\r\npermits the oil to fill the groove; when it is pushed into the groove\r\nin the axle, the oil is ejected and a further supply is cut off.\r\n\r\nAn improved pill machine, invented by Messrs. W. N. Fort and R. R.\r\nMoore, of Lewisville, Ark., is adapted to the manufacture of pills in\r\nlarge quantities. The machine has mechanism for grinding and mixing\r\ningredients, a grooved wheel and trough for forming the pills, and a\r\ndevice for applying powder.\r\n\r\nAn improvement in millstone adjustments has been patented by Mr.\r\nStephen P. Walling, of South Edmeston, N. Y. This invention consists\r\nin a screw applied to the end of the mill spindle on which the stone\r\nis rigidly held, so that the running stone may be forced by the screw\r\naway from the stationary stone and held against the action of a spring\r\nat the opposite end of the spindle, the object being to prevent the\r\nstones from becoming dulled by contact with each other.\r\n\r\nAn improved attachment for sewing machines for soaking or waxing the\r\nthread as it passes the needle, has been patented by Mr. Pedro F.\r\nFernandez, of San Juan, Porto Rico. The invention consists in a frame\r\nsecured to the arm of a sewing machine by a thumb-screw, and provided\r\nwith a clamping device for holding wax or soap.\r\n\r\nA novel combination of a toggle and springs and levers for operating a\r\ndrag saw has been patented by Mr. Harvey Hughes, of Wheat Ridge, Ohio.\r\nThe saw, while properly guided, is free to move up or down without\r\naffecting the leverage.\r\n\r\nAn improvement in filters, which consists in re-enforcing the felt\r\ndisk with a backing of wire cloth to enable it to resist heavy water\r\npressure, has been patented by Mr. B. P. Chatfield, of Aiken, S. C.\r\n\r\nA basket having light sheet metal sides attached to a wooden bottom by\r\ncrimping the edges over a rib on the periphery of the bottom, has been\r\npatented by Mr. Samuel Friend, of Decatur, Ill. The handle and lid may\r\nbe easily removed to permit of packing and storage.\r\n\r\nAn improved cross bar for fastening doors, patented by Mr. Richard\r\nCondon, of La Salle, Ill., has a spring acted portion which engages a\r\nsocket on the door casing, and is retained in that position by a\r\nspring catch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW IRONING TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engraving represents a convenient and inexpensive\r\ntable recently patented by Mr. Albert H. Hogins, of Morrisania, N. Y.\r\nIt is more especially designed for ironing, but it may be used for\r\nother purposes when closed up. The top is made in two tapering\r\nsections, A B. The section, B, is narrower than the other, and is\r\npivoted at its wider end to a bar, E, which slides into a socket\r\nformed in the table. The table has five legs, one of which, D, is\r\nattached to a sliding rail that supports the narrower end of the\r\nmovable part of the top. The table is provided with a drawer in one\r\nend and with a tray, C, for containing blankets, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGINS IMPROVED TABLE.]\r\n\r\nThe convenience and practicability of this table for general laundry\r\nuse, will be apparent without further explanation. The board, B, when\r\ndrawn out will be used for ironing skirts, shirts, and other garments\r\nrequiring a board of this character, and when the table is closed\r\ntogether and fastened by the hooks, it may be used in ironing larger\r\narticles. When closed it presents the appearance of an ordinary table\r\nand may be used as such.\r\n\r\nFurther information may be obtained by addressing the inventor as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NOVEL ENGINE REGULATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engraving represents two different styles of\r\nregulator, invented by Mr. Stenberg, in which the effect of\r\ncentrifugal force is utilized. In a vessel, A, of parabolic shape is\r\nplaced a disk, C, which floats on glycerine contained by the vessel,\r\nand is attached to the walls of the vessel by an annular membrane, so\r\nthat it may rise and fall in a vertical direction as the glycerine is\r\ncarried with more or less force toward the edge of the vessel by\r\ncentrifugal action. The inner surface of the vessel, A, is provided\r\nwith radial grooves, by which the rotary motion of the vessel is\r\ncommunicated to the glycerine. To the center of the disk, C, is\r\nattached a vertical rod, which extends downward through the hollow\r\nshaft and is connected with governor valve. An increase of speed\r\nthrows the glycerine toward the periphery of the valve, and, raising\r\nthe disk, C, closes the steam valve; a diminution of speed permits the\r\nglycerine to fall back, when the disk descends and the valve opens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STENBERG REGULATOR.]\r\n\r\nThe disk, C, has a small aperture for the admission and escape of air,\r\nand the apparatus is adjusted by pouring lead into the groove in the\r\ndisk.\r\n\r\nThe regulator shown in Fig. 2 operates upon the same principle, but it\r\nis adjusted by means of a spring.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus is manufactured by Blancke Bros., Magdeburg.--_Musée de\r\nl'Industrie._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STRANGE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBotel Tobago is an island in the South Seas which has lately been\r\nvisited by a party of United States naval officers. They were\r\nsurveying a rock east of the South Cape of Formosa, and called at this\r\nisland. They found a curious race of Malay stock. These aborigines did\r\nnot know what money was good for. Nor had they ever used tobacco or\r\nrum. They gave the officers goats and pigs for tin pots and brass\r\nbuttons, and hung around the vessel all day in their canoes waiting\r\nfor a chance to dive for something which might be thrown overboard.\r\nThey wore clouts only, ate taro and yams, and had axes, spears, and\r\nknives made of common iron. Their canoes were made without nails, and\r\nwere ornamented with geometrical lines. They wore the beards of goats\r\nand small shells as ornaments.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of these strange people given by Dr. Siegfried, in\r\na letter read at the last meeting of the Philadelphia Academy of\r\nNatural Sciences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDY FOR THE NEW CARPET BEETLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoticing a statement made by Mr. J. A. Lintner, to the effect that the\r\nPersian insect powder would probably prove unavailing as a remedy\r\nagainst the ravages of the new carpet beetle (_Anthrenus_), W. L.\r\nCarpenter, of the U.S.A., was led to institute some experiments with\r\nthis well known insecticide, the results of which he communicates to\r\nthe current number of the _Naturalist_. A small quantity of the powder\r\nwas introduced, on the point of a penknife, under a tumbler beneath\r\nwhich various insects were consecutively confined. The movements of\r\nthe insects brought them in contact with the poison, which readily\r\nadhered to their body; in endeavoring to remove it from their\r\nappendages a few particles would be carried to the mouth and thence to\r\nthe stomach, with fatal effect. The results were briefly thus: A honey\r\nbee became helpless in 15 minutes; a mad wasp in 8 minutes; a small\r\nant in 5 minutes; a large butterfly resisted the effects for over an\r\nhour, and apparently recovered, but died the next day; a house-fly\r\nbecame helpless in 10 minutes; a mosquito in 15; and a flea in 3\r\nminutes. In experimenting on beetles, an insect was secured as nearly\r\nthe size of the carpet beetle as could be found. It was easily\r\naffected, and became helpless in 12 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn these, and experiments with various other insects, the scent from\r\nthe powder did not produce any bad effect on those subjected to its\r\nodor where actual contact was not possible; but when carried to the\r\nmandibles the effect was to produce complete paralysis of the motor\r\nnerves. The experiments prove that all insects having open mouth parts\r\nare peculiarly susceptible to this popular insecticide. As a result,\r\nthe writer does not hesitate to recommend the powder to housekeepers\r\nas an infallible agent in destroying the carpet beetle and preventing\r\nits ravages. The Persian insect powder liberally sprinkled upon the\r\nfloor before putting down a carpet, and afterward freely placed around\r\nthe edges, and never swept away, will suffice to preserve a large\r\nsized carpet. No ill effects from its use need be feared by the\r\nhouseholder, since the drug is poisonous to no kinds of animals except\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANANA FLOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe banana has recently found a new use in Venezuela. It has the\r\nproperty of keeping the soil moist round it, in a country where\r\nsometimes no rain falls for months; so it has been employed to give\r\nfreshness, as well as shade, to the coffee plant, whose cultivation\r\nhas been greatly extended (Venezuela produced 38,000,000 kilogrammes\r\nof coffee in 1876). The Venezuelans can consume but little of the\r\nbanana fruit thus furnished, so that attention is being given to\r\nincreasing its value as an export. At the Paris Exhibition were\r\nsamples of banana flour (got by drying and pulverizing the fruit\r\nbefore maturity) and brandy (from the ripe fruit) The flour has been\r\nanalyzed by MM. Marcano and Muntz. It contains 66.1 per cent of\r\nstarch, and only 2.9 of azotized matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW STENCIL PEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engraving shows new form of stencil pen invented by\r\nMr. J. W. Brickenridge, of La Fayette, Ind. In Fig. 1 the entire\r\napparatus is shown in perspective; Fig. 2 is a longitudinal section of\r\nthe pen; and Fig. 3 is a vertical section of a portion of the driving\r\napparatus. In this instrument compressed air is used as a motive force\r\nfor driving the perforating needle. The inverted cup, shown in detail\r\nin Fig. 3, has its mouth closed with a flexible diaphragm, which is\r\nvibrated rapidly by a pitman having a convex end attached by its\r\ncenter to the middle of the diaphragm. The pitman is reciprocated by a\r\nsimple treadle motion, which will be readily understood by reference\r\nto Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRICKENRIDGE'S PNEUMATIC STENCIL PEN.]\r\n\r\nThe cup has a small aperture covered by a valve to admit of the\r\nentrance of air when the diaphragm is drawn down. The pen, shown in\r\ndetail in Fig. 2, has a cup and flexible diaphragm similar to the one\r\nalready described. The diaphragm rests upon the enlarged end of a bar\r\nwhich carries at its lower end a perforating needle. The pen is\r\nconnected with the driving mechanism by a flexible tube. The needle\r\nbar is pressed lightly against the diaphragm by a spiral spring.\r\n\r\nWhen the treadle motion is operated the impelling diaphragm is\r\nrapidly vibrated, and through the medium of the air contained in the\r\nflexible tube it communicates motion to the pen diaphragm and\r\nconsequently to the needle bar and needle. If, while the needle is\r\nreciprocated in this way, the pen is moved over the surface of the\r\npaper, a line of fine perforations will be made. With this instrument\r\nstencils may be made for making multiplied copies of maps, drawings,\r\nand manuscripts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF OCEAN TELEGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the celebration in this city of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the\r\nformation of the company for laying the first Atlantic cable, Monday,\r\nMarch 10, the projector of the enterprise, Mr. Cyrus W. Field, spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nNEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS: Twenty-five years ago this evening, in this\r\nhouse, in this room, and on this table, and at this very hour, was\r\nsigned the agreement to form the New York, Newfoundland and London\r\nTelegraph Company--the first company ever formed to lay an ocean\r\ncable. It was signed by five persons, four of whom--Peter Cooper,\r\nMoses Taylor, Marshall O. Roberts, and myself--are here to-night. The\r\nfifth, Mr. Chandler White, died two years after, and his place was\r\ntaken by Mr. Wilson G. Hunt, who is also present. Of my associates, it\r\nis to be said to their honor--as might have been expected from men of\r\ntheir high position and character--that they stood by the undertaking\r\nmanfully for twelve long years, through discouragements such as nobody\r\nknows but themselves. Those who applaud our success know little\r\nthrough what struggles it was obtained. One disappointment followed\r\nanother, till \"hope deferred made the heart sick.\" We had little help\r\nfrom outside, for few had any faith in our enterprise. But not a man\r\ndeserted the ship: all stood by it to the end. My brother Dudley is\r\nalso here, who, as the counsel of the company, was present at the\r\nsigning of the agreement, and went with Mr. White and myself the week\r\nafter to Newfoundland, to obtain the charter, and was our legal\r\nadviser through those anxious and troubled years, when success seemed\r\nvery doubtful. At St. John's the first man to give us a hearty\r\nwelcome, and who aided us in obtaining our charter, was Mr. Edward M.\r\nArchibald, then Prime Minister of Newfoundland, and now for more than\r\ntwenty years the honored representative of Her Majesty's Government at\r\nthis port, who is also here to-night. It is a matter for grateful\r\nacknowledgment that we were spared to see accomplished the work that\r\nwe began; and that we meet now, at the end of a quarter of a century,\r\nto look with wonder at what has been wrought since in other parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nOur little company came into existence only a few weeks before the\r\nWestern Union Telegraph Company, which is entitled to share in our\r\ncongratulations, and has kindly brought a connecting wire into this\r\nroom, by which we can this evening communicate with every town and\r\nvillage from the Atlantic to the Pacific; and by our sea cables, with\r\nEurope, Asia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies, and\r\nSouth America. While our small circle has been broken by death but\r\nonce, very different has it been with the Atlantic Telegraph Company,\r\nwhich was formed in London in 1856, to extend our line across the\r\nocean. At its beginning there were eighteen English and twelve\r\nAmerican directors, thirty in all, of whom twenty-nine have either\r\ndied or retired from the board. I alone still remain one of the\r\ndirectors.\r\n\r\nMany of the great men of science on both sides of the Atlantic, who\r\ninspired us by their knowledge and their enthusiasm, have passed away.\r\nWe have lost Bache, whose Coast Survey mapped out the whole line of\r\nthe American shores; and Maury, who first taught us to find a path\r\nthrough the depths of the seas; and Berryman, who sounded across the\r\nAtlantic; and Morse; and last, but not least, Henry. Across the water\r\nwe miss some who did as much as any men in their generation to make\r\nthe name of England great--Faraday and Wheatstone, Stephenson and\r\nBrunel--all of whom gave us freely of their invaluable counsel,\r\nrefusing all compensation, because of the interest which they felt in\r\nthe solution of a great problem of science and engineering skill. It\r\nis a proud satisfaction to remember that while the two Governments\r\naided us so generously with their ships, making surveys of the ocean,\r\nand even carrying our cables in the first expeditions, such men as\r\nthese gave their support to an enterprise which was to unite the two\r\ncountries, and in the end to bring the whole world together.\r\n\r\nOthers there are, among the living and the dead, to whom we are under\r\ngreat obligations. But I cannot repeat the long roll of illustrious\r\nnames. Yet I must pay a passing tribute to one who was my friend, as\r\nhe was the steadfast friend of my country--Richard Cobden. He was one\r\nof the first to look forward with the eye of faith to what has since\r\ncome to pass. As long ago as 1851 he had a sort of prophet's dream\r\nthat the ocean might yet be crossed, and advised Prince Albert to\r\ndevote the profits of the great London Exhibition of that year to an\r\nattempt thus to unite England with America. He did not live to see his\r\ndream fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBut though men die, their works, their discoveries, and their\r\ninventions live. From that small beginning under this roof, arose an\r\nart till then scarcely known, that of telegraphing through the depths\r\nof the sea. Twenty-five years ago there was not an ocean cable in the\r\nworld. A few short lines had been laid across the channel from England\r\nto the Continent, but all were in shallow water. Even science hardly\r\ndared to conceive of the possibility of sending human intelligence\r\nthrough the abysses of the ocean. But when we struck out to cross the\r\nAtlantic, we had to lay a cable over 2,000 miles long, in water over\r\n2 miles deep. That great success gave an immense impulse to submarine\r\ntelegraphy then in its infancy, but which has since grown till it has\r\nstretched out its fingers tipped with fire into all the waters of the\r\nglobe. \"Its lines have gone into all the earth, and its words to the\r\nends of the world.\" To-day there are over 70,000 miles of cable,\r\ncrossing the seas and the oceans. And, as if it were not enough to\r\nhave messages sent with the speed of lightning, they must be sent in\r\nopposite directions at the same moment. I have just received a\r\ntelegram from Valentia, Ireland, which reads, \"This anniversary\r\nwitnesses duplex working across the Atlantic as an accomplished\r\nfact\"--by which the capacity of all our ocean cables is doubled.\r\n\r\nWho can measure the effect of this swift intelligence passing to and\r\nfro? Already it regulates the markets of the world. But better still\r\nis the new relation into which it brings the different kindreds of\r\nmankind. Nations are made enemies by their ignorance of each other. A\r\nbetter acquaintance leads to a better understanding; the sense of\r\nnearness, the relation of neighborhood, awakens the feeling of\r\nbrotherhood. Is it not a sign that a better age is coming, when along\r\nthe ocean beds strewn with the wrecks of war, now glide the messages\r\nof peace?\r\n\r\nOne thing only remains which I still hope to be spared to see, and in\r\nwhich to take a part, the laying of a cable from San Francisco to the\r\nSandwich Islands--for which I have received this very day a concession\r\nfrom King Kalakaua, by his Minister, who is here to night--and from\r\nthence to Japan, by which the island groups of the Pacific may be\r\nbrought into communication with the continents on either side--Asia\r\nand America--thus completing the circuit of the globe.\r\n\r\nBut life is passing, and perhaps that is to be left to other hands.\r\nMany of our old companions have fallen, and we must soon give place to\r\nour successors. But though we shall pass away, it is a satisfaction to\r\nhave been able to do something that shall remain when we are gone. If\r\nin what I have done to advance this enterprise, I have done something\r\nfor the honor of my country and the good of the world, I am devoutly\r\ngrateful to my Creator. This has been the great ambition of my life,\r\nand is the chief inheritance which I leave to my children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GARY MOTOR.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American:_\r\n\r\nIn your article on the \"Gary Motor,\" issue of March 8, page 144, you\r\nsay: \"There is no neutral line in the sense that polarity changes when\r\nMr. Gary moves his piece of sheet iron with its attached shingle nail\r\nacross the pole or near the pole of a magnet.\" \"The most delicate\r\ninstruments fail to detect such a change of polarity,\" etc. Mr. Gary's\r\nclaim of a neutral line is of course absurd, but you are wrong in\r\nsaying that the polarity does not change under the conditions\r\ndescribed in the _Harper's Monthly_ article. Mr. Gary is perfectly\r\ncorrect in claiming a change of polarity in that experiment, although\r\nhis other claim of deriving from this change of polarity a continuous\r\nmotion without consuming energy are manifestly absurd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gary Motor A.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gary Motor B.]\r\n\r\nThe change of polarity is easily explained. If a bar of soft iron,\r\nwhose length is two or three times the distance between the poles of\r\nthe horseshoe magnet, be placed in front of the latter as in the\r\nsketch, and at some distance, poles will be induced, as shown by the\r\nletters N S. Now let the bar approach the magnet. When within a short\r\ndistance consequent points will be formed and the polarity at the ends\r\nwill be reversed, the bar having four poles, as in the second sketch.\r\nThe bar of soft iron must have certain dimensions depending on the\r\nsize and power of the horseshoe magnet. By using a powerful\r\nelectro-magnet in place of a permanent one, a soft iron bar of\r\nconsiderable size may be used, and the change of polarity exhibited by\r\nshowing the repulsion in one case for the south pole and in the other\r\nfor the north pole of a heavy permanent magnet. When in the proper\r\nposition a very small movement of the soft iron bar is sufficient to\r\nproduce the change.\r\n\r\nWM. A. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nCornell University, Ithaca, N.

I,\r\nhowever, tried the experiment by which Gary claims to prove the\r\nexistence of his neutral line, and soon found the same explanation\r\nthat the writer in the AMERICAN has given. I then, curiously enough,\r\nmodified the experiment in precisely the manner he suggests, placing\r\nthe magnet in a vertical position, and using first a piece of sheet\r\niron and then an iron wire under it. This was before seeing the\r\narticle in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. My experiment is well illustrated\r\nby the writer's diagram, except that the nail should be at the end of\r\nthe iron wire, where its polarity is of course most strongly marked.\r\nBut the result is not as he states it. For, as the wire is brought up\r\ntoward the magnet, the nail drops off before the wire touches the\r\nmagnet. When the sheet iron is used, the point at which the nail drops\r\noff is farther from the magnet than in the case of the wire, and when\r\nit is brought nearer it will again pick up the nail, which then\r\ncontinues to cling until the iron touches the magnet and afterwards.\r\nThus the existence of a line in which the soft iron, or induced\r\nmagnet, does not attract the nail, and above and below which it does\r\nattract it, is demonstrated. That the polarity of the induced magnet\r\nis reversed when it crosses this line may be demonstrated as follows:\r\nWhen it is held beyond (or below) this line (Fig. 1), the negative\r\npole of the permanent magnet, the positive being kept at a distance,\r\nmay be made to approach the iron and touch it, without causing the\r\nnail to drop. (Fig. 3.) But when contact occurs, the whole of the iron\r\nmust possess the polarity of that part of the magnet which it touches,\r\nnamely, negative. Hence in the position indicated in Fig. 1, the\r\npolarity of the induced magnet does not correspond with that of the\r\npermanent magnet, but is as indicated by the letters. On the other\r\nhand, if the positive pole alone be made to approach, the nail will\r\ndrop; but when it is very near, or in contact, it again holds the\r\nnail, and the iron is now positive; and if the negative pole also be\r\nnow brought into contact, the polarity of the soft iron will\r\ncorrespond with that of the magnet, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gary's Neutral Line A.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gary's Neutral Line B.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gary's Neutral Line C.]\r\n\r\nThese experiments should be performed with the soft iron under both\r\npoles of the magnet, and the ends of the former should extend somewhat\r\nbeyond the poles of the latter, or the nail is liable to jump to the\r\nmagnet as the \"neutral\" line is crossed. The position of the letters\r\nin Fig. 1, of the previous article, represents the polarity of the\r\ninduced magnet to be the same as that of the permanent, which is true\r\nonly within (or above) the line described; and this, together with his\r\nstatement that no such line can be discovered, appears to indicate\r\nthat the writer relied upon his knowledge of the laws of magnetism to\r\nstate what would be the result, without testing it experimentally. It\r\nis probable that this reversal of polarity is susceptible of\r\nexplanation by the known laws of magnetic currents, but if it has\r\nhitherto escaped observation, its discovery is certainly deserving of\r\nnotice, and may lead to valuable results. Of the fact, any one may\r\neasily convince himself by the simple experiments above described.\r\n\r\nG. H.

These\r\ndimensions generally describe the cave's section. From the entrance\r\nthe course is a steep decline--seldom less than 40°. At times the\r\nceiling is so low that progress on hands and knees is necessary. About\r\n125 feet from the entrance the \"Ice Chamber\" is reached. At this spot\r\nthe cave widens into a well proportioned room, 8 by 12 feet. The floor\r\nis solid ice of unknown thickness, and on the right hand wall of the\r\nroom a curtain of ice drops to the floor, from a crevice extending\r\nhorizontally in the rock at the height of one's eyes. Close\r\nexamination discovers the water oozing from this crevice, and as it\r\nfinds its way down the side it freezes in the low temperature of the\r\nchamber. Singularly this one crevice, and that no wider than a knife\r\nedge, furnishes this, nature's ice house, with the necessary water. It\r\nwas a hot day in August, the thermometer marking 80° in the shade\r\nwhen the visit was made, and comparatively the cold was intense. In\r\ncommon with all visitors, we detached some large pieces of ice and\r\nwith them hurriedly departed, glad to regain the warmth of the outside\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable fact in connection with this wonder is that the\r\nwater only freezes in the summer. As the cold of actual winter comes\r\non the ice of the cave gradually melts, and when the river below is\r\nfrozen by the fierce cold of Northern Iowa, the ice has disappeared\r\nand a muddy slush has taken the place of the frigid floor. I would add\r\nthat the ice chamber forms the terminus of the cave. Beyond a shallow\r\ncrevice in the crumbling rock forbids further advance. The rock\r\nformation of this region is the Portland sandstone.\r\n\r\nWhy should the temperature of the ice chamber be such as to freeze the\r\nwater trickling into it? And above all, why should the ice disappear\r\nwith the cold of winter?\r\n\r\nMansfield, O. H. M.

Cowper, of London, was exhibited in operation before the Society of\r\nTelegraph Engineers, in that city. It is a curious and remarkable\r\ninvention. By its use the handwriting of the operator may be\r\ntransmitted, but a double circuit, that is, two telegraph wires, are\r\nused. The operator moves with his hand an upright pointer or stylus,\r\nwith which he writes the message on paper. The stylus has two arms\r\nconnected with it, one of which arms, when the stylus makes an upward\r\nmovement, causes a current to be sent over one wire, while the other\r\narm causes a current to pass over the other wire when the stylus is\r\nmoved laterally. These two motions are, at the receiving end of the\r\nline, made to operate on the needles of galvanometers, and the latter\r\nare by silk threads combined or connected with a delicately suspended\r\nink tube, from which a minute stream of ink falls upon the strip of\r\npaper below it; the arrangement being such that the combined motions\r\nof the galvanometers so move the ink pen as to make it correspond to\r\nthe motion of the stylus at the sending end. The apparatus is said to\r\nwork very well, and it is expected that it will form a useful adjunct\r\nto the art of telegraphy. We present herewith a facsimile of writing\r\ndone by this new instrument, which has been worked with success over a\r\nline of forty miles length. It is hardly probable that it can compete\r\nin rapidity with some of the telegraph instruments now in use; but for\r\nmany purposes it is likely to become important, while in point of\r\ningenuity it is certainly a great achievement, and the author is\r\ndeserving of the highest credit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Writing Telegraph.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RARE GEOLOGICAL SPECIMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. R. M. Luther, while absent in attendance upon the Missionary\r\nConvention, held in Addison, Vt., obtained through the kindness of the\r\nRev. Mr. Nott a rare and curious geological specimen from the shores\r\nof Lake Champlain. It is a slab of limestone, about eleven inches long\r\nby six inches wide, which seems to be composed almost entirely of\r\nfossils. There is not half an inch square of the surface which does\r\nnot show a fossil. There are many varieties, some of which have not\r\nbeen identified, but among those which have been are many remains of\r\nthe Trinucleus conceniricus, some specimens of Petraia, fragments of\r\nthe Orthis, a number of Discinæ, several well preserved specimens of\r\nLeptenæ, and impressions of Lingula. The latter is the only shell\r\nwhich has existed from the first dawn of life until the present time\r\nwithout change. The specimens of existing Lingula are precisely\r\nsimilar to those found in the earliest geological formations. There\r\nare also in the slab several rare specimens of seaweed, remains of\r\nwhich are seldom found at so early an age in the geological history of\r\nthe world. The slab belongs to the lower Silurian formation, the first\r\nin which organic remains are found. It is probably from the Trenton\r\nepoch of that age. If geologists can be trusted, at the time the\r\nlittle animals, whose remains are thus preserved, were living, the\r\nonly part of this continent which had appeared above the primeval\r\nocean was a strip of land along the present St. Lawrence River and the\r\nnorthern shores of the great lakes, with a promontory reaching out\r\ntoward the Adirondacks, and a few islands along what is now the\r\nAtlantic coast line.--_Bennington (Vt.) Banner._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWPER'S WRITING TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most recent of the brilliant series of telegraphic marvels which\r\nhas from time to time, and especially of late, engaged the attention\r\nof the world, is the \"telegraphic pen\" of Mr. E. A. Cowper, the well\r\nknown engineer of Great George street, Westminster. This ingenious\r\napparatus, which constitutes the first real telegraph, was publicly\r\nshown by its inventor at the meeting of the Society of Telegraph\r\nEngineers on Wednesday, February 26.\r\n\r\nThere had been no lack of copying telegraphs hitherto. We have\r\nBakewell's, Casselli's, Meyer's, and D'Arlincourt's, so recently tried\r\nat our General Post Office by Mr. Preece. All of these instruments\r\ntelegraph an almost perfect copy of the writing or sketch submitted to\r\nthem by means of synchronous mechanism. But the process is necessarily\r\ncomplex and slow; whereas by the new device a person may take the\r\nwriting pencil in his hand, and himself transmit his message in the\r\nact of writing it.\r\n\r\nThe principle which guided Mr. Cowper to a solution of the problem\r\nwhich he has successfully overcome, is the well known mathematical\r\nfact that the position of any point in a curve can be determined by\r\nits distance from two rectangular co-ordinates. It follows, then, that\r\nevery position of the point of a pencil, stylus, or pen, as it forms a\r\nletter, can be determined by its distance from two fixed lines, say\r\nthe adjacent edges of the paper. Moreover it is obvious that if these\r\ndistances could be transmitted by telegraph and recombined so as to\r\ngive a resultant motion to a duplicate pen, a duplicate copy of the\r\noriginal writing would be produced. But inasmuch as the writing stylus\r\nmoves continuously over the paper, the process of transmission would\r\nrequire to be a continuous one; that is to say, the current traversing\r\nthe telegraph line, and conveying the distances in question (or what\r\ncomes to the same thing, the up and down, and direct sidelong ranges\r\nof the stylus) would require to vary continuously in accordance with\r\nthe range to be transmitted.\r\n\r\nMr. Cowper effects this by employing two separate telegraphic\r\ncircuits, each with its own wire, battery, sending, and receiving\r\napparatus. One of these circuits is made to transmit the up and down\r\ncomponent writing of the pencil's motion, while the other\r\nsimultaneously transmits its sidelong component. At the receiving\r\nstation these two components are then recomposed by a pantograph\r\narrangement of taut cords, or levers, and the resultant motion is\r\ncommunicated to the duplicate pen at that place. The plan adopted by\r\nMr. Cowper to transmit each continuously varying component is to cause\r\nthe resistance of the circuit to vary very closely with the component\r\nin question. Fig. 5 shows how the apparatus is theoretically arranged\r\nfor this purpose. P is the writing style, which is held in the\r\nwriter's hand in the ordinary way, while he shapes the letters one by\r\none on paper pulled uniformly underneath by means of clockwork. To P\r\nare attached, at right angles, two arms, a a, one for each circuit;\r\nbut as it is only necessary to consider one of the circuits, say that\r\nsending up and down motions, we will confine our attention for the\r\npresent to the arm, a. One pole of the sending battery, B, is\r\nconnected to the arm, a, the other pole being connected to earth. Now\r\nthe arm, a, is fitted with a sliding contact at its free extremity,\r\nand as the pencil, P, is moved in writing, a slides lengthwise across\r\nthe edges of a series of thin metal contact plates, C, insulated from\r\neach other by paraffined paper. Between each pair of these plates\r\nthere is a resistance coil, C, and the last of these is connected\r\nthrough the last plate to the line, L. It will be seen that as a\r\nslides outward across the plates the current from the battery has to\r\npass through fewer coils, since a short-circuits a number of coils\r\nproportional to its motion. But the fewer of these coils in circuit\r\nthe stronger will be the current in the line; so that the extent of\r\nthe motion of the arm, a, in the direction of its length, that is to\r\nsay, the direct component of the motion of the pencil along the line\r\nof the arm, a, is attended by a corresponding change in the current\r\ntraversing the line. If the pencil makes a long up and down stroke\r\nthere will be a strong current in the line, if a short one there will\r\nbe a weak current, and so on. A precisely similar arrangement is used\r\nto transmit the sidelong motion of the pencil along the line, L.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe current from the line, L, flows at the receiving station through a\r\npowerful galvanometer, G, to earth. The galvanometer has a stout\r\nneedle, one tip of which is connected to a duplicate pen, P, by a\r\nthread, t, which is kept taut by a second thread stretched by a\r\nspring, s'. The current from the line, L', flows through a similar\r\ngalvanometer, G', to earth. The needle of G' is also connected to the\r\npen, P, by a taut thread, t', stretched by means of the spring, s.\r\nNow, since the needle of each of these galvanometers deflects in\r\nproportion to the strength of the current flowing through its coil,\r\nthe points of these two needles keep moving with the varying currents.\r\nBut since these currents vary the motions of the sending pen, the\r\nreceiving pen controlled by the united movements of the needles will\r\ntrace out a close copy of the original writing. We give on another\r\npage a facsimile of a sentence written by Mr. Cowper's telegraph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COWPER WRITING TELEGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nThe receiving pen is a fine glass siphon, drawing off aniline ink from\r\na small glass holder. There are thirty-two coils, C, in each circuit,\r\nwith a corresponding number of contact plates, c, so as to get\r\naccuracy of working. A few Daniell's cells are sufficient to operate\r\nthe apparatus, and writing has been already sent successfully over a\r\nline 40 miles in length. The writing may be received either of the\r\nsame size or larger or smaller than the original, as the case may be.\r\nAt present the writing must not be too hurried, that is, unless the\r\ncharacters are bold and well formed; but further improvement will, of\r\ncourse, quicken the working of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe engravings, Figs. 1 to 4, illustrate the actual apparatus. Fig. 4\r\nis a plan of the sending instrument, with the writing pencil, a, the\r\ntraveling paper, b, the light connecting rods or arms, d (which\r\ncorrespond to a in the theoretical diagram above), the series of metal\r\ncontact plates over which these arms slide, the resistance coils\r\nconnected to these plates, and the battery and line wires. It will be\r\nseen that each arm, d, is connected to its particular battery, and\r\neach set of contact plates to its particular line. Fig. 3 is an\r\nelevation of the sending instrument, in which a is the pencil as\r\nbefore, c c the contact plates over which the arms, d d, slide, f f\r\nthe coils, and b the traveling slip of paper.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 is a plan of the receiving instrument, in which h h are the\r\nlight pivoted needles surrounded by coils of fine insulated copper\r\nwires, i i, and controlled in their zero position by the\r\nelectro-magnets, j j j j, placed underneath, the whole forming a pair\r\nof galvanoscopes or current detecters, one for each line. It will be\r\nunderstood that the varying currents from the lines are allowed to\r\nflow through the coils, i i, so as to deflect the needles, and that\r\nthe deflections of the needles follow, so to speak, the variations of\r\nthe currents. The electro-magnets are magnetized by a local battery;\r\npermanent magnets might, however, take their place with a gain in\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nNow the writing pen, k, is connected to the nearest tip of the needle,\r\nh, of each galvanoscope by threads, n n, which are kept taut by the\r\nfibers, o_{1} o_{2} o_{3}, the springs, o, and the pins, o_{4}. In\r\nthis way the motions of the needles are recombined in the motion of\r\nthe duplicate pen upon the paper, p.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is an elevation of the receiving instrument, in which i i are\r\nthe coils as before, j j j j the controlling electro-magnets, k is the\r\nwriting siphon dipping with its short leg into the ink well, m, and l\r\nis the bridge from which the writing siphon is suspended by means of a\r\nthread and spring. The long leg of the siphon reaches down to the\r\nsurface of the paper, p, which is pulled along beneath it in contact\r\nwith the film of ink filling the point of the tube. When the siphon is\r\nat rest its point marks a zero line along the middle of the paper, but\r\nwhen the receiver is working, the siphon point forms each letter of\r\nthe message upon the paper as it passes.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALUMINUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe splendid exhibit of the French aluminum manufacturers at the late\r\nExhibition has again called attention to that metal, which is so\r\nadmirably adapted to many purposes on account of its great lightness\r\nand its stability under the influence of the atmosphere. While\r\naluminum industry has heretofore been thought to be confined to France\r\nsolely, we are now told by Mr. C. Bambery, in the Annual Report of the\r\nSociety of Berlin Instrument Makers, that for some years past aluminum\r\nhas been extensively manufactured in Berlin.\r\n\r\nThree firms especially (Stückradt, Häcke, and Schultze) are engaged in\r\nthis branch of industry.\r\n\r\nThe articles manufactured principally are nautical instruments, as\r\nsextants, compasses, etc. The German navy is supplied throughout with\r\naluminum instruments. As a proof of the superiority of German\r\naluminum, it may here be mentioned that the normal sets of weights and\r\nbalances used by the International Commission for the regulation of\r\nweights and measures, which lately was in session at Paris, were\r\nobtained from Stückradt, in Berlin, and not from any of the firms\r\nat Paris, the reputed seat of aluminum industry.\r\n\r\nAluminum is, in Berlin, generally used pure, and cast pieces only are\r\ncomposed of aluminum containing about 5 per cent of silver.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the use of aluminum will remain limited, even in case the\r\ncost of manufacturing it could be materially reduced, until some\r\nmethod shall have been discovered by which aluminum may be soldered.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty has, in spite of all efforts, not yet been overcome,\r\nand for some purposes, to which the metal would otherwise be well\r\nadapted, it remains so far unavailable. Here then is a chance for some\r\ningenious mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPROVED DOOR BOLT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engraving represents, in perspective and in section,\r\nan improved door bolt, recently patented by Mr. Thomas Hoesly, of New\r\nGlaras, Wis.\r\n\r\nThe principal features of this bolt will be understood by reference to\r\nthe engraving. On the plate or body are cast two loops or guides for\r\nthe bolt, and the plate is slotted under the bolt, and a lug projects\r\ninto the slot and bears against a spring contained by a small casing\r\nriveted to the back of the plate. The end of the bolt is beveled, and\r\nits operation is similar to that of the ordinary door latch. Two\r\nhandles are provided, one of which is of sufficient length to reach\r\nthrough the door, and a pawl or dog accompanies the bolt, which may be\r\nattached to the door with a single screw, and is to be used in locking\r\nthe door. The bolt is very simple and strong, suitable for shops,\r\nout-buildings such as barns, stables, etc., and some of the doors of\r\ndwellings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOESLY'S DOOR BOLT.]\r\n\r\nFurther information may be obtained by addressing the inventor, as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIMNEY FLUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. W. H. Jackson & Co., of this city, whose long experience in\r\ntreating refractory flues gives weight to their opinion, communicate\r\nto the _American Architect_ the following useful information:\r\n\r\nTo secure a good draught the chimney should be of sufficient size,\r\nshould be carried up above surrounding objects, should be as straight\r\nas possible throughout its length, and should be as smooth as possible\r\ninside, to avoid friction. As a draught is caused by unequal\r\ntemperatures, the chimney should be so arranged as to avoid a rapid\r\nradiation of heat. If in an exterior wall there should be at least 8\r\ninches of brickwork between the flue and the exterior surface. For\r\ncountry houses it is much better to have the chimneys run up through\r\nthe interior, as the flue is more easily kept warm, and the heat that\r\nis radiated helps to warm the house. The most frequent cause of a\r\n\"smoky chimney\" is the insufficient size of the flue for the grate or\r\nfireplace connected therewith. The flue should not be less than one\r\neighth the capacity of the square of the width and height of the grate\r\nor fireplace. That is, if the grate has a front opening 20 inches wide\r\nand 26 inches high, the flue should be 8 in. × 8 in.; or, with an\r\nopening 36 inches wide and 32 inches high, the flue should be 12 in. ×\r\n12 in.; and, to get the best result, the opening into the flue from\r\nthe grate or fireplace should be of a less number of square inches\r\nthan the square of the flue, and never larger, as no more air should\r\nbe admitted at the inlet than can be carried through the flue. Where\r\nthere is more than one inlet to the same flue, the sum of all the\r\ninlets should not more than equal the size of the flue. A number of\r\nstoves may be connected with the same flue, one above another, if this\r\nrule is observed.\r\n\r\nA square flue is better than a narrow one, as in two flues containing\r\nthe same number of square inches the square flue would have the\r\nsmallest amount of wall surface, and consequently less friction for\r\nthe ascending currents, and less absorption of heat by the walls.\r\nChimneys should be closely built, having no cracks nor openings\r\nthrough which external air may be drawn to weaken the draught. If they\r\ncould be made throughout their length as impervious to air as a tube\r\nof glass, with interior surface as smooth, one cause of smoky chimneys\r\nwould be removed. A downward current of air is frequently caused by\r\nsome contiguous object higher than the chimney, against which the wind\r\nstrikes. This higher object may sometimes be quite a distance from the\r\nchimney, and still affect it badly. A good chimney top constructed to\r\nprevent a down draught will remedy this difficulty. Each grate or\r\nfireplace should have a flue to itself. Under very favorable\r\nconditions, two grates or fireplaces might be connected with the same\r\nflue, but it is not a good plan. We have known grates and fireplaces\r\nconnected with two flues, where they have been built under a window\r\nfor instance, and, owing to there being insufficient room for a flue\r\nof suitable size, a flue has been run up on each side of the window.\r\nThis is a very bad plan, and never can work well; it requires too much\r\nheat to warm both flues, and if the room in which the grate or\r\nfireplace is situated should be pretty close, so that there was no\r\nother entrance for air, there is danger that it would circulate down\r\none flue and up the other, forcing smoke out of the fireplace into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED FURNACE FOR BURNING GARBAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuse matter and garbage of large cities is in the main composed\r\nof animal and vegetable offal of the kitchens; of the sweepings of\r\nwarehouses, manufactories, saloons, groceries, public and private\r\nhouses; of straw, sawdust, old bedding, tobacco stems, ashes, old\r\nboots, shoes, tin cans, bottles, rags, and feathers; dead cats, dogs,\r\nand other small animals; of the dust and sweepings of the streets, the\r\ncondemned fruit, vegetables, meat, and fish of the markets, all of\r\nwhich compose a mass of the most obnoxious and unhealthy matter that\r\ncan be deposited near human habitations.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of the furnace shown in the accompanying engravings aims\r\nto produce a change of form and of chemical nature and a great\r\nreduction in bulk of all such refuse and garbage within the limits of\r\nthe city where it accumulates, without screening, separating,\r\npreparing, or mixing, without the expense of using other fuel, without\r\nany offensive odors being generated in the operation, and to produce\r\nan entirely unobjectionable residuum or product that may be made\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--FOOTE'S FURNACE FOR BURNING GARBAGE.]\r\n\r\nAs a rule organic matter largely preponderates in the refuse, being as\r\nhigh in some instances as 94 per cent. There is always more than\r\nenough to generate sufficient heat to fuse the earthy or inorganic\r\nportion, which is mainly composed of sand, clay, and the alkalies from\r\nthe coal and vegetable ashes, etc.\r\n\r\nBy producing a high degree of heat in the combustion of the organic\r\nportion of the refuse with a forced blast or forced draught, the\r\nnon-combustible elements are fused, and form a vitreous slag, which is\r\nentirely inodorous and unobjectionable, and which may be utilized for\r\nmany purposes.\r\n\r\nThe upper section or cone of the consuming furnace is built of boiler\r\niron, and lined with fire brick resting upon an iron plate, which is\r\nsupported by iron columns.\r\n\r\nThe hearth is made of fire brick, and is in the form of an inverted\r\ncone, being smaller at the bottom and larger at the top, as shown in\r\nFig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the hearth are perforated near the bottom with arches for\r\nthe tuyeres or blast pipes, and also in front for the special blast\r\npipe and the tapping hole. The top of the furnace is closed with an\r\niron plate, provided with a circular opening, through which the hopper\r\nenters the top of the furnace.\r\n\r\nAt the left in the larger engraving is seen an elevator, operated by a\r\nsteam engine, for conveying the garbage and refuse to a platform,\r\nwhence it is projected into the furnace by an inclined plane or chute.\r\n\r\nGas or smoke conductors convey the gas from the top of the furnace to\r\nthe furnace of the boiler and to the heating oven, where it is used in\r\nheating air, which is conveyed through the iron pipes passing through\r\nthe heating oven into a wind box, from which it enters the furnace at\r\nseveral points near the bottom by means of the tuyere pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nThe consumption of the garbage is effected near the bottom of the\r\nfurnace, where the air is forced in, and is continued as long as the\r\nblast is applied, and while burning at the base it is continually\r\nsinking down at the top, so that it is necessary to keep filling all\r\nthe time. The odoriferous gases and the hot products of such\r\ncombustion are forced upward through the superimposed mass, and escape\r\nto the fires of the boiler and heating oven, and, being largely\r\ncomposed of carbonic oxide and the hydrocarbon gases distilled from\r\nthe animal and vegetable offal of the garbage, are thoroughly\r\nconsumed; and it is said that by this means not only are all the\r\noffensive odors destroyed, but the heat generated is utilized for\r\nmaking steam and heating the air used for blast.\r\n\r\nThe refuse in its descent through the high furnace is exposed to the\r\ndrying action of the hot gases of distillation and the hot products of\r\ncombustion, its temperature increasing in its descent the nearer it\r\napproaches the tuyeres, and becomes completely desiccated and\r\ncombustible when it reaches the blast. The high heat in this way\r\nobtained by the combustion of the organic portion melts all of the\r\ninorganic portion, forming a vitreous slag or glass, which may be\r\nallowed to run continuously, or by closing the tap may be allowed to\r\naccumulate, and can be drawn off at intervals. If there is an adequate\r\nsupply of clay and sand in the refuse to combine with the ashes, the\r\nslag will run hot and free. The combination of silex or alumina and an\r\nalkali in proper portions always yields a fusible, easy-running\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nThe molten slag, as it runs from the furnace, may be discharged into\r\ntanks of cold water, which will pulverize or granulate it, making it\r\nlike fine sand, or as it pours over a runner, through which it flows,\r\nif struck with a forcible air or steam blast it will be spun into fine\r\nthread-like wool.\r\n\r\nThe furnace once lighted and started may be kept running day and night\r\ncontinuously for days, months, or years, if desired; but if it becomes\r\nnecessary to stop at any time, the tuyere pipes may be removed and the\r\nholes all stopped with clay, so as to entirely shut off the supply of\r\nair, and it will then hold in fire for many days, and will be in\r\nreadiness to start again at any time the pipes are replaced and the\r\nblast turned on.\r\n\r\nThis furnace is the invention of Mr. Henry R. Foote, of Stamford,\r\nConn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ANCIENT GREEK VASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vase shown in the accompanying engravings must not be classed with\r\nordinary ceramic ware, as it is a veritable work of art. It is the\r\ncelebrated cup of Arcesilaus, which is preserved in the collection of\r\nthe library of Richelieu street after having figured in the Durand\r\nMuseum. It was found at Vulsei, in Etruria. It was made by a potter of\r\nCyrene, the capital of Cyrenaica, founded by Greeks from the island of\r\nThera. It is remarkable that Cyrene, removed from the center of\r\nGrecian manufacture, should possess a manufactory of painted vases\r\nfrom which have come so many works of art. The traveler, Paul Lucas,\r\ndiscovered in the necropolis of Cyrene, in 1714, many antique vases,\r\nboth in the tombs and in the soil. One of them is still preserved in\r\nthe Museum at Leyden. The Arcesilaus, who is represented on this vase,\r\nis not the celebrated skeptical philosopher of that name; it is\r\nArcesilaus, King of Cyrenaica, who was sung by Pindar, and who was\r\nvanquished in the Pythian games under the 80th Olympiad (458 years\r\nB.C.).\r\n\r\nThe height of this vase is 25 centimeters, its diameter 28\r\ncentimeters. The paste is very fine, of a pale red. It is entirely\r\ncoated with a black groundwork, which has been generally re-covered\r\nwith a yellowish white clay, baked on.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Brongniart, this piece has been subjected to the\r\nbaking process at least two or three times, thus indicating that the\r\nceramic art had made considerable progress in Cyrene even at that\r\nremote epoch.\r\n\r\nThe following description of this vase is given in the catalogue of\r\nthe Durand Museum: The King Arcesilaus is seated under a pavilion upon\r\nthe deck of a ship. His head is covered with a kind of hat with a\r\nlarge brim, and his hair hangs down upon his shoulders. He is clothed\r\nin a white tunic and embroidered cloak or mantle, and he carries a\r\nscepter in his left hand; under his seat is a leopard, and his right\r\nhand he holds toward a young man, who makes the same gesture, and he\r\nis weighing in a large scale assafoetida, which is being let down\r\ninto the hold of the ship. We know that he deals with assafoetida\r\nbecause one of the personages (the one who lifts up his arm toward the\r\nbeam of the scale) holds in his right hand something resembling that\r\nwhich is in the scale, and the Greek word traced near it signifies\r\n\"that which prepares _silphium_.\" Assafoetida, the resinous\r\nmatter of the silphium, is used largely by the Greeks in the\r\npreparation of their food. The Orientals to-day make frequent use of\r\nit and call it the delight of the gods; while in Europe, because of\r\nits repulsive odor, it has long been designated as _stircus diaboli_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--ANCIENT GREEK VASE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--TOP OF GREEK VASE.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW-RAISED BREAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomebody thinks he has discovered that snow, when incorporated with\r\ndough, performs the same office as baking powder or yeast. \"I have\r\nthis morning for breakfast,\" says a writer in the _English Mechanic_,\r\n\"partaken of a snow-raised bread cake, made last evening as follows:\r\nThe cake when baked weighed about three quarters of a pound. A large\r\ntablespoonful of fine, dry, clean snow was intimately stirred with a\r\nspoon into the dry flour, and to this was added a tablespoonful of\r\ncaraways and a little butter and salt. Then sufficient cold water was\r\nadded to make the dough of the proper usual consistence (simply\r\nstirred with the spoon, not kneaded by the warm hands), and it was\r\nimmediately put into a quick oven and baked three quarters of an hour.\r\nIt turned out both light and palatable. The reason,\" adds the writer,\r\n\"appears to be this: the light mass of interlaced snow crystals hold\r\nimprisoned a large quantity of condensed atmospheric air, which, when\r\nthe snow is warmed by thawing very rapidly in the dough, expands\r\nenormously and acts the part of the carbonic acid gas in either baking\r\npowder or yeast. I take the precise action to be, then, not due in any\r\nway to the snow itself, but simply to the expansion of the fixed air\r\nlodged between the interstices of the snow crystals by application of\r\nheat. This theory, if carefully followed out, may perchance give a\r\nclew to a simple and perfectly innocuous method of raising bread and\r\npastry.\" And stop the discussion as to whether alum in baking powders\r\nis deleterious to health or otherwise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW AGRICULTURAL INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn improved gate, invented by Messrs. P. W. McKinley and George L.\r\nEllis, of Ripley, O., is designed for general use. It is operated by\r\ncords and pulleys, and can be opened without dismounting from the\r\nhorse. It is constructed so that it cannot sag, and is not liable to\r\nget out of order.\r\n\r\nAn improved apparatus for pressing tobacco has been patented by Mr. F.\r\nB. Deane, of Lynchburg, Va. It consists mainly in the construction of\r\na suspended jack, arranged to travel over a row of hogsheads, so that\r\na single jack gives successively to each hogshead the desired\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nAn improved combined harrow and corn planter has been patented by Mr.\r\nM. McNitt, of Hanover, Kan. In this machine the opening, pulverizing,\r\nplanting, and covering teeth are combined with a single frame.\r\n\r\nA machine, which is adapted to the thrashing and cleaning of peas and\r\nseeds, and for cleaning all kinds of grain, has been patented by Mr.\r\nJ. J. Sweatt, of Conyersville, Tenn.\r\n\r\nMr. Amos M. Gooch, of Farmington, W. Va., has patented an improved\r\ncorn planter, which drops the fertilizer simultaneously with the seed,\r\nand is provided with a device for pressing the soil around the seed,\r\nleaving over the seed a portion of loose earth.\r\n\r\nAn improved machine for harvesting cotton has been patented by R. H.\r\nPirtle, of Lowe's, Ky. This machine carries two vertical cylinders\r\narmed with teeth or spurs, and two inclined endless belts provided\r\nwith teeth. The teeth of the cylinders and the belts remove the cotton\r\nfrom the plants, and deliver it to a receptacle carried by the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Julius Fern and Samuel Bligh, of Oneonta, N. Y., have patented\r\nan improved power for churning and other purposes where little power\r\nis required. It consists in the combination of a drum and weight, a\r\ntrain of gearing, and a pallet wheel arranged to oscillate a balanced\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\nAn improvement in the class of feed cutters in which two or more\r\nknives work between parallel bars attached to the cutter box, has been\r\npatented by Messrs. J. N. Tatum and R. C. Harvey, of Danville, Va. The\r\nimprovement consists in arranging the knives so that one begins and\r\nfinishes its cut in advance of the other.\r\n\r\nMr. William Bradberry, of Darrtown, O., has invented an improvement in\r\nreciprocating churns. The aim of this inventor is to utilize the\r\nresistance of the milk as a source of power. To accomplish this a\r\npeculiar combination of mechanism is required, which cannot be clearly\r\ndescribed without an engraving.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING AND EYESIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Javel, in a recent lecture, tries to answer the question, \"Why is\r\nreading a specially fatiguing exercise?\" and also suggests some\r\nremedies for this fatigue. First, M. Javel says reading requires an\r\nabsolutely permanent application of eyesight, resulting in a permanent\r\ntension of the organ, which may be measured by the amount of fatigue\r\nor by the production of permanent myopy. Secondly, books are printed\r\nin black on a white ground; the eye is thus in presence of the most\r\nabsolute contrast which can be imagined. The third peculiarity lies in\r\nthe arrangement of the characters in horizontal lines, over which we\r\nrun our eyes. If we maintain during reading a perfect immobility of\r\nthe book and the head, the printed lines are applied successively to\r\nthe same parts of the retina, while the interspaces, more bright, also\r\naffect certain regions of the retina, always the same. There must\r\nresult from this a fatigue analogous to that which we experience when\r\nwe make experiments in \"accidental images,\" and physicists will admit\r\nthat there is nothing more disastrous for the sight than the prolonged\r\ncontemplation of these images. Lastly, and most important of all in M.\r\nJavel's estimation, is the continual variation of the distance of the\r\neye from the point of fixation on the book. A simple calculation\r\ndemonstrates that the accommodation of the eye to the page undergoes a\r\ndistinct variation in proportion as the eye passes from the beginning\r\nto the end of each line, and that this variation is all the greater in\r\nproportion to the nearness of the book to the eye and the length of\r\nthe line. As to the rules which M. Javel inculcates in order that the\r\ninjurious effects of reading may be avoided, with reference to the\r\npermanent application of the eyes, he counsels to avoid excess, to\r\ntake notes in reading, to stop in order to reflect or even to roll a\r\ncigarette; but not to go on reading for hours on end without stopping.\r\nAs to the contrast between the white of the paper and the black of the\r\ncharacters, various experiments have been made in the introduction of\r\ncolored papers. M. Javel advises the adoption of a slightly yellow\r\ntint. But the nature of the yellow to be used is not a matter of\r\nindifference; he would desire a yellow resulting from the absence of\r\nthe blue rays, analogous to that of paper made from a wood paste, and\r\nwhich is often mistakenly corrected by the addition of an ultramarine\r\nblue, which produces gray and not white. M. Javel has been led to this\r\nconclusion both from practical observation and also theoretically from\r\nthe relation which must exist between the two eyes and the colors of\r\nthe spectrum. His third advice is to give preference to small volumes\r\nwhich can be held in the hand, which obviates the necessity of the\r\nbook being kept fixed in one place, and the fatigue resulting from\r\naccidental images. Lastly, M. Javel advises the avoidance of too long\r\nlines, and therefore he prefers small volumes, and for the same reason\r\nthose journals which are printed in narrow columns. Of course every\r\none knows that it is exceedingly injurious to read with insufficient\r\nlight, or to use too small print, and other common rules. M. Javel\r\nconcludes by protesting against an invidious assertion which has\r\nrecently been made \"in a neighboring country,\" according to which the\r\ndegree of civilization of a people is proportional to the number of\r\nthe short sighted shown to exist by statistics; the extreme economy of\r\nlight, the abuse of reading to the detriment of reflection and the\r\nobservation of real facts, the employment of Gothic characters and of\r\na too broad column for books and journals, are the conditions which,\r\nM. Javel believes, lead to myopy, especially if successive generations\r\nhave been subjected to these injurious influences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORESCENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Nuesch records, in a recent number of the _Journal de Pharmacie_,\r\nsome curious observations regarding luminous bacteria in fresh meat.\r\nSome pork cutlets, he found, illuminated his kitchen so that he could\r\nread the time on his watch. The butcher who sent the meat told him the\r\nphosphorescence was first observed in a cellar, where he kept scraps\r\nfor making sausages. By degrees all his meat became phosphorescent,\r\nand fresh meat from distant towns got into the same state. On\r\nscratching the surface or wiping it vigorously, the phosphorescence\r\ndisappears for a time; and the butcher wiped carefully the meat he\r\nsent out. All parts of the animal, except the blood, acquired the\r\nphenomenon over their whole surface. The meat must be fresh; when it\r\nceases to be so, the phosphorescence ceases, and _Bacterium termo_\r\nappear. None of the customers had been incommoded. It was remarked\r\nthat if a small trace of the phosphorescent matter were put at any\r\npoint on the flesh of cats, rabbits, etc., the phosphorescence\r\ngradually spread out from the center, and in three or four days\r\ncovered the piece; it disappeared generally on the sixth or seventh\r\nday. Cooked meat did not present the phenomenon but it could be had in\r\na weak manner, from cooked albumen or potatoes. No other butcher's\r\nshop in the place was affected. The author is uncertain whether to\r\nattribute the complete disappearance of the phenomenon to the higher\r\ntemperature of the season, or to phenic acid, or to fumigation with\r\nchlorine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARMS OF NATURAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Derby, in an address at the Edinburgh University, said:\r\n\"Of the gains derivable from natural science I do not trust myself to\r\nspeak; my personal knowledge is too limited, and the subject is too\r\nvast. But so much as this I can say--that those who have in them a\r\nreal and deep love of scientific research, whatever their position in\r\nother respects, are so far at least among the happiest of mankind....\r\nNo passion is so absorbing, no labor is so assuredly its own reward\r\n(well that it is so, for other rewards are few); and they have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that, while satisfying one of the deepest\r\nwants of their own natures, they are at the same time promoting in the\r\nmost effectual manner the interests of mankind. Scientific discovery\r\nhas this advantage over almost every other form of successful human\r\nefforts, that its results are certain, that they are permanent, that\r\nwhatever benefits grow out of them are world-wide. Not many of us can\r\nhope to extend the range of knowledge in however minute a degree; but\r\nto know and to apply the knowledge that has been gained by others, to\r\nhave an intelligent appreciation of what is going on around us, is in\r\nitself one of the highest and most enduring of pleasures.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VESUVIUS RAIL WAY.--The Italian Ministry of Public Works, in union\r\nwith the Ministry of Finance and the Prefecture of Naples, has issued\r\nthe concession for the construction of the Vesuvius Railway. The line\r\nwill run along that part of the mountain which has been proved, after\r\nthe experience of many years, to be the least exposed to the\r\neruptions. The work is to be commenced immediately, and it is believed\r\nthat it will come into use during the present year. A sufficient\r\nnumber of carriages are being built to convey 600 persons during the\r\nday. The line is to be constructed upon an iron bridge, built after a\r\npatented system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POTTERY TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the various economic products of the vegetable kingdom,\r\nscarcely any hold a more important place than barks, whether for\r\nmedicinal, manufacturing, or other purposes. The structure and\r\nformation of all barks are essentially very similar, being composed of\r\ncellular and fibrous tissue. The cell contents of these tissues,\r\nhowever, vary much in different plants; and, for this reason, we have\r\nfibrous or soft, woody, hard, and even stony barks. To explain\r\neverything which relates to the structure of bark would lead us into\r\nlong details which our space will not permit. Briefly stated, the bark\r\nof trees (considering, now, those of our own climate) consists of\r\nthree layers. The outermost, called the \"cortical,\" is formed of\r\ncellular tissue, and differs widely in consistency in different\r\nspecies; thus, in the cork oak, which furnishes man with one of his\r\nmost useful commercial products, the cortical layer acquires\r\nextraordinary thickness. The middle layer, called the \"cellular\" or\r\n\"green bark,\" is a cellular mass of a very different nature. The cells\r\nof which it is composed are polyhedral, thicker, and more loosely\r\njoined, and filled with sap and chlorophyl. The inner layer (next the\r\nwood), called the \"liber,\" consists of fibers more or less long and\r\ntenacious. It is from the liber that our most valuable commercial\r\nfibers are obtained. In some plants the fibrous system prevails\r\nthroughout the inner bark; but what we wish to refer to more\r\nparticularly at present is a remarkable example of the harder and more\r\nsilicious barks, and which is to be found in the \"Pottery Tree\" of\r\nPara. This tree, known to the Spaniards as _El Caouta_, to the French\r\nas _Bois de Fer_, to the Brazilians as _Caraipe_, is the _Moquilea\r\nutilis_ of botanists, and belongs to the natural order _Ternstroeiaceæ_.\r\nIt is very large, straight, and slender, reaching a height of 100 feet\r\nbefore branching; its diameter is from 12 to 15 inches; and its wood\r\nis exceedingly hard from containing much flinty matter. Although the\r\nwood of the tree is exceedingly sound and durable, the great value of\r\nthe tree to the natives exists in the bark for a purpose which, to say\r\nthe least, is a novel one in the application of barks--that of the\r\nmanufacture of pottery. The Indians employed in the manufacture of\r\npottery from this material always keep a stock of it on hand in their\r\nhuts for the purpose of drying and seasoning it, as it then burns more\r\nfreely, and the ashes can be gathered with more ease than when fresh.\r\nIn the process of manufacturing the pottery the ashes of the bark are\r\npowdered and mixed with the purest clay that can be obtained from the\r\nbeds of the rivers; this kind being preferred, as it takes up a larger\r\nquantity of the ash, and thus produces a stronger kind of ware. Though\r\nthe proportions of ash and clay are varied at the will of the maker,\r\nand according to the quality of the bark, a superior kind of pottery\r\nis produced by a mixture of equal parts of fine clay and ashes. All\r\nsorts of vessels of small or large size for household or other\r\npurposes are made of this kind of ware, as are also vases or\r\nornamental articles, many of which are painted and glazed. These\r\narticles are all very durable, and are able to stand almost any amount\r\nof heat; they are consequently much used by the natives for boiling\r\neggs, heating milk, and indeed for culinary purposes generally. A\r\nbrief glance at the structure of the bark will show how it comes to be\r\nso well adapted for this purpose. The bark seldom grows more than half\r\nan inch thick, and is covered with a skin or epidermis; when fresh, it\r\ncuts somewhat similar to a soft sandstone, but when dry, it is very\r\nbrittle and flint like, and often difficult to break. On examination\r\nof a section under the microscope, all the cells of the different\r\nlayers are seen to be more or less silicated, the silex forming in the\r\ncells when the bark is still very young. In the inner bark the flint\r\nis deposited in a very regular manner, the particles being straight\r\nand giving off branches at right angles; that of the porous cells of\r\nthe bark, however, is very much contorted, and ramifies in all\r\ndirections. In the best varieties of the tree, those growing in rich\r\nand dry soil, the silex can be readily detected by the naked eye; but\r\nto test the quality of the various kinds of bark, the natives burn it\r\nand then try its strength between their fingers; if it breaks easily\r\nit is considered of little value, but if it requires a mortar and\r\npestle to break, its quality is pronounced good. From an analysis of\r\nthis singular bark, that of old trees has been found to give 30.8 per\r\ncent of ash, and that of young 23.30 per cent. Of the different layers\r\nof old bark, the outer gave 17.15 per cent, the middle 37.7, and the\r\ninner 31. The wood of the tree, in comparison with the bark, is\r\nrelatively poor in silex, the duramen of an old tree giving only 2.5\r\nper cent of silex.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASS SPONGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural history of sponges had, up to the middle of this century,\r\nbeen comparatively neglected. Until 1856, when Lieberkuhn published\r\nhis treatise on sponges, very little or nothing had been written on\r\nthe subject. Later, Haeckel did much to determine their exact nature,\r\nand it is now universally admitted that sponges form one of the\r\nconnecting links between the animal and the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nSponges, generally considered, consist of fine porous tissue, covered,\r\nduring life, with viscid, semi-liquid protoplasm, and are held in\r\nshape and strengthened by a more or less rigid skeleton, consisting\r\nchiefly of lime or silica. The tissue consists of a very fine network\r\nof threads, formed probably by gradual solidification of the threads\r\nof protoplasm. The inorganic skeleton is formed by larger and smaller\r\ncrystals and crystalline threads. In the various families of sponges\r\nthe quantity of inorganic matter varies greatly; some sponges are\r\nnearly devoid of an inorganic skeleton, while other families consist\r\nchiefly of lime or silica, the organic tissue being only rudimentarily\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nAs observed in their natural state, sponges are apparently lifeless.\r\nWhen, however, a live sponge is placed in water containing some finely\r\npowdered pigment in suspension, it will be noticed that in regular,\r\nshort intervals water is absorbed through the pores of the tissue and\r\nejected again through larger openings, which are called \"osculæ.\"\r\nFollowing up these into the interior, we find them divided into\r\nnumerous branches, the walls of which are, under the microscope, found\r\nto be covered with minute cells, fastened at one end only and\r\noscillating continually. By means of these cells the sponge receives\r\nits nourishment.\r\n\r\nSponges with very rigid inorganic skeletons may be divided into two\r\nclasses--calcareous and silicious--according to whether the skeleton\r\nis chiefly composed of lime or silica.\r\n\r\nOur engravings represent two species of the latter kind, which are, on\r\naccount of the peculiar appearance of their skeleton, called glass\r\nsponges.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents the \"sprinkling pot sponge,\" _Eucleptella\r\naspergillum_. It is generally found in very deep water throughout the\r\nPacific. Specimens were found over fifty years ago, but, as they had\r\nto be brought up from depths between 500 and 800 fathoms, they\r\nremained very scarce and sold at fabulous prices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--SPRINKLING POT SPONGE.--(_Eucleptella\r\naspergillum_.)]\r\n\r\nThe skeleton is formed by small crystals and long threads of vitreous\r\nsilica, cemented together, during life, by protoplasm. They are\r\narranged in longitudinal and annular bands so as to form a long curved\r\ncylinder, about nine to twelve inches long, the walls of which are\r\nabout one inch in thickness. The threads and bands are interwoven with\r\nthe greatest regularity, and when the skeleton is freed from the\r\nadhering organic matter, it looks extremely beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the intersecting bunches of crystals are connected\r\nis shown in Fig. 2. The upper end of the cylinder is closed by a\r\nperforated cover, which probably has given rise to the name of the\r\nsponge. The upper portion of the cylinder is surrounded by a few\r\nirregular, annular masses of organic tissue, which adheres loosely\r\nonly to the skeleton. The lower end is formed by a bunch of long\r\nthreads, rooting firmly in the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--SPONGE CRYSTALS MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\nUp to about ten years ago the price of specimens of this sponge was\r\nvery high. At that time, however, a colony of Eucleptellas was found\r\nnear the cities of Cebu and Manila, in the East Indies, in a depth not\r\nexceeding 100 fathoms, and since they have appeared in larger\r\nquantities in the market. It is remarkable that, contrary to their\r\nhabits, these organisms have immigrated into regions to which they\r\nwere totally unaccustomed. Yet it must be regarded as a greater\r\ncuriosity that they have been accompanied to their new abode by a few\r\nanimals living in equally deep water and never met with before at\r\ndepths less than three or four hundred fathoms. Among these animals is\r\na _Phormosoma_ (water hedgehog), noted for its long spines.\r\n\r\nGlass sponges are not confined to tropical regions. They are met with\r\nin latitudes as high as the Färöe Islands, where the beautiful\r\n_Holtenia Carpentaria_ abounds. It is represented in Fig. 3. Its\r\ncup-shaped skeleton is similar in structure to that of the\r\n_Eucleptella_; numerous crystalline needles protrude from the surface\r\nof the upper part. Lately some specimens of _Holtenia_ have been found\r\non the coast of Florida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--HOLTENIA CARPENTERIA.]\r\n\r\nGlass sponges serve as dwellings for numerous animals, especially\r\ncrustaceæ. A small shrimp inhabits the tubes of the _Eucleptella_, a\r\nmale and a female generally living together. They are shut up as in a\r\nprison in their crystalline home, as they are generally too large to\r\npass through the meshes formed by the bundles of crystals. It was\r\nformerly believed that these skeletons had actually been built by the\r\nshrimps, and we can find no explanation for this curious circumstance,\r\nother than that the shrimps entered these habitations while very small\r\nand became too large to leave them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS PROTECTED BY INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Francis Darwin, in a lecture on \"Means of Self-Defense among\r\nPlants,\" delivered lately at the London Institution, said that one of\r\nthe most curious forms of defense known is afforded by a recently\r\ndiscovered class of plants, which, being stingless themselves, are\r\nprotected by stinging ants, which make their home in the plant and\r\ndefend it against its enemies. Of these the most remarkable is the\r\nbull's-horn acacia (described by the late Mr. Belt in his book \"The\r\nNaturalist in Nicaragua\"), a shrubby tree with gigantic curved thorns,\r\nfrom which its name is derived. These horns are hollow and tenanted by\r\nants, which bore a hole in them, and the workers may be seen running\r\nabout over the green leaves. If a branch is shaken the ants swarm out\r\nof the thorns and attack the aggressor with their stings. Their chief\r\nservice to the plant consists in defending it against leaf-cutting\r\nants, which are the great enemy of all vegetation in that part of\r\nAmerica. The latter form large underground nests, and their work of\r\ndestruction consists in gathering leaves, which they strip to form\r\nheaps of material, which become covered over with a delicate white\r\nfungus, on which the larvæ of the ants are fed, so that literally they\r\nare a colony of mushroom growers. The special province of the little\r\nstinging ants, which live in the thorns of the acacia, is, therefore,\r\nto protect the leaves of the shrub from being used by the leaf-cutters\r\nto make mushroom beds. Certain varieties of the orange tree have\r\nleaves which are distasteful to the leaf-cutters, this property of the\r\nleaves thus forming a means of defense. Other plants are unaccountably\r\nspared by them--grass, for example, which, if brought to the nest, is\r\nat once thrown out by some ant in authority. The bull's-horn acacia,\r\nin return for the service rendered by the stinging ants, not only\r\naffords them shelter in its thorns, but provides them with nectar\r\nsecreted by glands at the base of its leaves, and also grows for them\r\nsmall yellow pear-shaped bodies, about one twelfth of an inch in\r\nlength, at the tip of some of its leaflets, which they use as food.\r\nThese little yellow bodies are made up of cells containing protoplasm\r\nrich in oil, and afford the insects an excellent food. When the leaf\r\nunfolds, the ants may be seen running from one leaflet to another, to\r\nsee if these little yellow bodies are ripe; and if they are ready to\r\nbe gathered they are broken up by the ants and carried away to the\r\nnest in the thorn. Several small birds, also, build their nests in the\r\nbull's horn acacia, thus escaping from a predatory ant which is\r\ncapable of killing young birds. The trumpet tree, another plant of\r\nSouth and Central America, is also protected by a standing army of\r\nants; and, like the above mentioned acacia, grows for its protectors\r\nsmall food bodies containing oil, but instead of secreting nectar in\r\nits leaves it harbors a small insect (coccus), whose sweet secretion\r\nis much relished by the ants. Dr. Beccari mentions an epiphytal plant\r\ngrowing on trees in Borneo, the seeds of which germinate, like those\r\nof the mistletoe, on the branches of the tree; and the seedling stem,\r\ncrowned by the cotyledons, grows to about an inch in length, remaining\r\nin that condition until a certain species of ant bites a hole in the\r\nstem, which then produces a gall-like growth that ultimately\r\nconstitutes the home of the ants. If the plant is not fortunate enough\r\nto be bitten by an ant it dies. These ants, then, protect their plant\r\nhome by rushing out fiercely on intruders, and thus are preserved the\r\nsessile white flowers which, in this plant, are developed on the tuber\r\nlike body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCE IN IRON.--At a meeting of the Philadelphia Iron Merchants'\r\nAssociation, March 11, prices of all descriptions of merchant iron\r\nwere advanced fully 5 per cent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANEROID BAROMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aneroid barometer was invented by M. Vidi, of Paris. It consists\r\nessentially of a circular box, the face of which is made of thin\r\nelastic metal, rendered more elastic by being stamped and pressed into\r\nconcentric circular wave-like corrugations. This box is nearly\r\nexhausted of air, and its elastic face supports the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, and yields to it with elastic resistance in proportion to\r\nthe amount of pressure. Thus, if the atmospheric pressure increases,\r\nthe face is pressed inward; if atmospheric pressure diminishes, the\r\nelastic reaction of the metal moves the face outward. These movements\r\nare communicated to an index by suitable and very delicate mechanism,\r\nand registered in largely magnified dimensions, by the movements of\r\nthis index upon the face of the dial.\r\n\r\nAneroid barometers are now made of pocket size, compensated for\r\ntemperature, and with double scales, one reading the height of the\r\nbarometer column, the other the elevation obtained. I have, says Prof.\r\nW. M. Williams, used one of these during many years, and find it a\r\nvery interesting traveling companion. It is sufficiently sensitive to\r\nindicate the ascent from the ground floor to the upper rooms of a\r\nthree-storied house, or to enable the traveler sitting in a railway\r\ntrain to tell, by watching its face, whether he is ascending or\r\ndescending an incline.\r\n\r\nSuch slight variations are more easily observed on the aneroid than on\r\nthe mercurial barometer, and therefore it is commonly stated that the\r\naneroid is the more sensitive instrument. This, however, is a\r\nfallacious conclusion. It is not the superior sensitiveness of the\r\nmovements of the instrument, but the greater facility of reading them,\r\nthat gives this advantage to the aneroid, the index of which has a\r\nneedle point traveling nearly in contact with the foot of the\r\ndivisions; the readings are further aided by a needle point register\r\nattached to a movable rim, which may be brought point to point against\r\nthe index, thus showing the slightest movement that human vision may\r\ndetect. A magnifying lens may be easily used in such a case.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that the aneroid barometer is not an\r\nindependent instrument; it is merely a device for representing the\r\nmovements of the mercurial barometer. It is regulated by comparison\r\nwith the primary instrument, and this comparison should be renewed\r\nfrom time to time, as the elastic properties of the metal may and do\r\nvary.\r\n\r\nAn adjusting or regulating screw is attached to the back of the\r\ninstrument, and is usually movable by a watch key.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the magnified reading of course magnifies any primary\r\nerror, and is largely dependent on the accuracy of the mechanism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALBO-CARBON LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need hardly remind our readers that numerous unsuccessful attempts\r\nhave been made at various times to enrich ordinary coal gas by the aid\r\nof volatile oils. Upon the present occasion we have to place before\r\nthem particulars of a process having the same object in view, but\r\nwhich is so far dissimilar in that it deals with a solid substance\r\ninstead of a liquid oil. The invention has been brought into its\r\npresent practical shape by Mr. James Livesey, C. E., of No. 9 Victoria\r\nChambers, Westminster, in conjunction with Mr. Kidd, with whom it\r\noriginated. The process consists in the employment of a substance\r\ncalled albo-carbon, which is the solid residuum of creosote. This\r\nmaterial is moulded into the form of candles, which in large lamps are\r\nplaced in a metallic vessel or receiver near the gas burner. The\r\nalbo-carbon is warmed by the heat of the burning gas, the heat being\r\ntransmitted to the receiver by a metallic conductor. Upon the\r\nalbo-carbon being raised to the necessary temperature it volatilizes,\r\nand as the coal gas passes over it to the burner its vapor becomes\r\nmingled with the gas, and greatly raises its illuminating power. Of\r\ncourse when first lighted the coal gas only is burned, but in a few\r\nminutes the albo-carbon communicates its enriching vapor to it. The\r\nonly alteration necessary to the present gas fittings is the\r\nvaporizing chamber, which is of simple construction, although at\r\npresent the details of the various arrangements necessary for the\r\ndifferent kinds of lights have not yet been fully worked out. This\r\ninvention is now being tried experimentally in the eastern section of\r\nthe Westminster Aquarium, where we recently examined it, and found it\r\nto afford a marked improvement upon the ordinary system of gas\r\nillumination, although a smaller number of burners is being used.\r\nTried alternately with ordinary coal gas, the higher illuminating\r\npower of the albo-carbon light was very remarkable. It appears that\r\nthere are 200 burners fitted at the Aquarium with the new light, and\r\nthese successfully take the place of 500 ordinary gas burners\r\npreviously in use. The illuminating effect is stated to be doubled,\r\nwith an additional advantage as regards economy. The reduction of cost\r\narises from the smaller quantity of gas consumed with the albo-carbon\r\nprocess than without it, and the very small cost of the enriching\r\nmaterial. According to our information, 1,000 cubic feet of ordinary\r\ngas as generally used will, by the albo-carbon appliance, give as much\r\nillumination as 3,000 cubic feet without it, and the cost of the\r\nmaterial to produce this result is only 1s. 6d. Experiments have been\r\nmade with this light by Mr. T. W. Keates, the consulting chemist to\r\nthe Metropolitan Board of Works, who reports very favorably upon it,\r\nas does also Dr. Wallace, of Glasgow, who has obtained some very\r\nsatisfactory results with it. It is claimed for the albo-carbon\r\nmaterial that it is perfectly inexplosive, safe and portable, that it\r\ncauses no obstruction and leaves no residuum, and that the receivers\r\ncan be replenished almost indefinitely without any accumulation taking\r\nplace, so perfect is the evaporation of the albo-carbon. On the whole\r\nthe display at the Aquarium speaks greatly in favor of the new process\r\nof gas enrichment, which, other things being equal, bids fair to find\r\nits way into practice.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH AND AMERICAN HARDWARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Frederick Smith, Manager of the Union Land and Building Company\r\n(limited), recently read a paper on the above subject before the\r\nManchester Scientific and Mechanical Society. Mr. H. Whiley,\r\nSuperintendent of the Manchester Health Department, presided. The\r\nfollowing is the text of the paper, as given in the London\r\n_Ironmonger_. The lecturer said:\r\n\r\nA spectator in any of our courts of justice will generally be struck\r\nwith the amount of hard swearing which is given to the court, under\r\nthe name of evidence. He will find one set of witnesses testifying,\r\nunder oath, to one thing, and another set, also under oath, to the\r\nvery opposite. Some prove too much, some too little, some are of a\r\ntotally negative character, proving nothing, and some are of no\r\ncharacter at all, and therefore are willing to prove anything. To some\r\nextent the same phenomena are to be observed in reference to the\r\nquestion of foreign competition. On the one hand the manufacturers\r\nhold up to our affrighted vision the picture of our mills stopped, our\r\nmachine shops standing empty and idle, our hardware trade slipping\r\nthrough our fingers, our ships rotting in our own and in foreign\r\nports, and our greatness as a producing nation for ever passed away.\r\nOn the other hand, the journalists who take the labor side of the\r\nquestion, the trades-union leaders, and a large number of the workmen\r\nthemselves, hold that we have little or nothing to fear from our\r\nforeign rivals; that the depression, like those atmospheric ones of\r\nwhich our American cousins are constantly warning us, will pass away,\r\nand leave us with better times to follow. I will, therefore, as far as\r\npossible, keep out of the region of speculation, give you a few facts,\r\nshow you some examples, and leave you to draw your own inferences.\r\nSome two or three years ago ordinary axle pulleys of English make were\r\ndifficult to get; the price was scandalously high, and the quality as\r\nscandalously low. Out of a dozen probably four would not turn round\r\nwithout sticking, and the casting was--well, simply vile. I show you a\r\nsample rather above the average, and the retail price for this\r\ninferior article was 22s. per gross. All at once the Americans deluged\r\nthe English market with the pulley which I now show to you, and it\r\nneeds no explanation of mine to satisfy the mechanical minds present\r\nof the superiority of the transatlantic article; but when we also bear\r\nin mind that the price of the American was from 25 to 33 per cent less\r\nthan the English pulley, you can understand how the builders exulted,\r\nand how the Volscians of the Birmingham district were fluttered. Then,\r\nand not till then, would the English maker condescend to believe that\r\nit was possible to improve upon the wretched things which he had\r\nfoisted upon his customers, and he at once commenced to copy the\r\nAmerican pulley. He has not yet succeeded in producing such a\r\nbeautiful casting, but I venture to say that he has improved the\r\nquality more in the last eighteen months than in the previous eighteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nNow take the ordinary door furniture. For generations the English\r\nbuilder and householder has had to be content with the stereotyped,\r\nwith all its aggravating propensities. First, the little screw (so\r\nsmall as to be scarcely perceptible to touch or to sight) shakes loose\r\nfrom its countersunk depression in the spindle, gets lost, and lets\r\nthe knob go adrift; or next, the knob itself, formed of a bit of sheet\r\nbrass, turns round on its shank and the door cannot be opened, or the\r\nshank, not having a sufficient bearing on the spindle, works loose,\r\nand the whole thing is out of repair. It is the same thing to-day as\r\nit was when it tormented my grandfather; for, of course, no\r\nimprovement could be made until Uncle Sam sent us his cheap, strong,\r\nserviceable, and sensible \"Mineral Knob.\"\r\n\r\nThe English maker says: \"But look at the many devices which we have\r\ninvented for door furniture.\" Granted, and some of them very good, but\r\nnone of them so good as this--for the money. Plenty of them well\r\nadapted for extraordinary use, but none of them cheap enough and\r\nstrong enough to be placed in competition with this in fitting up the\r\ndwelling of the ordinary Englishman. The spindle and furniture of a\r\nlock is the portion which is liable to and receives the most rough\r\nusage.\r\n\r\nI have here an ordinary cheap set of china furniture of English make,\r\nwhich I dare not drop lest I should break it, but as you see, I dare\r\nthrow its Yankee competitor the whole length of this room. The retail\r\nprice of this English set is ninepence--the price of the American is\r\nless than sixpence. The English spindle is fitted with the usual\r\nlittle screw, the knob is loose, the roses are china, and liable to\r\nbreak with the least strain or blow. The American set, as you see, has\r\na long shank; the form of the knob is a very oblate spheroid, giving a\r\ngood grip and free play for the fingers between the knob and the door.\r\nThe rose is japanned iron, and has small studs or teeth projecting on\r\nits inner side effectually preventing it from turning round with the\r\nspindle; the screw is strong, and is tapped through the spindle\r\nitself, insuring both security and perfect steadiness. Several small\r\nwashers are supplied with each spindle, enabling the slack to be taken\r\nup perfectly, and at the same time preventing the spindle from\r\nsticking with any ordinary amount of friction.\r\n\r\nI will now show you a cheap American rim lock. First, you will notice\r\nthat both sides are alike. Next, that by pulling the latch forward it\r\ncan be turned half round, and is thereby converted from a right hand\r\nto a left hand, or _vice versa_, in an instant. This is an important\r\npoint to a builder, but our lockmakers do not seem to know it. Several\r\nattempts have been made to introduce locks of this kind, but the fancy\r\nprices put upon every article which departs, in ever so slight a\r\nmeasure, from the antediluvian patterns mostly used, practically\r\nprohibits their adoption. The carcass of the lock is of cast iron; the\r\ncasting, like all the small American castings, is simply perfect;\r\nbosses are cast round the follower and keyholes; the box staple is one\r\npiece of metal, neat and strong.\r\n\r\nBut there is another point, and, to my mind, the most important one.\r\nWhatever opinions may be held as to the relative quality of this lock,\r\nwhether it is better or worse than an English one, it is at least an\r\nhonest article. It makes no pretensions to be any better than it is.\r\nIt does not entrap the unwary purchaser by pretending to be a\r\nfirst-class article, when at the same time it may be a swindle.\r\n\r\nI will now show you an ordinary 6 inch rim-lock of English\r\nmanufacture. At a short distance it looks like a superior article; the\r\nfollower and keyhole appear as if they were bushed with brass. But let\r\nus take it to pieces, and see what we can find. The follower is a\r\nrough casting, not turned at the bearings, and is in no sense a fit.\r\nThe screw holes are not countersunk, but merely punched in; the key is\r\nof the roughest and worst fitting description; the inside is as rough\r\nand cheap as possible; the key is cut so as to deceive the purchaser\r\ninto the belief that there are twice as many wards in the lock as is\r\nreally the case, and the bushes prove to be thin plates of brass\r\nriveted on, and not bushes at all. In short, the whole article is a\r\nvile fraud, and the maker was a swindler. This is strong language, but\r\nI think you will agree with me when I maintain that it is not stronger\r\nthan the circumstances warrant.\r\n\r\nBut there are still its defects of bad design and useless workmanship.\r\nThe lock is of the usual form given to the English rim-lock, that is,\r\nit has a flange which requires to be let into the edge of the door. I\r\nhave fixed hundreds of them, and have never yet been able to see a use\r\nfor this flange. It is one great obstacle to the general introduction\r\nof a reversible lock; it adds to the labor of fixing without adding to\r\nthe security of the door, for if the door is to be forced from the\r\noutside, the box staples give way first; if from the inside, the\r\nunscrewing of the box staple is all that is necessary to give egress;\r\nif the door requires easing, it effectually prevents it being done--in\r\nfact, it is a nuisance, and nothing but a nuisance. But our lockmakers\r\ndo not appear to give these things a thought; their doctrine seems to\r\nbe, \"As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, notice that the edges of the iron which lie against the door\r\nand the sham bushes are ground bright. Here is labor wasted, for as\r\nsoon as the lock is fixed these polished portions are hidden for\r\never. Next, take the box staple. As is usual, it is fearfully and\r\nwonderfully made up of sheet iron, square iron, and brass; the outcome\r\nof which is that the showy brass striking piece comes unriveted, the\r\ndoor comes unfastened, and the tenant's temper comes unhinged. Why, in\r\nthe name of common sense, could they not substitute a neat malleable\r\ncasting? In our own houses I have long since discarded the ordinary\r\nbox staple for draw-back locks, and find it cheaper to buy a cast iron\r\nstaple, and throw away the one supplied by the English lockmaker.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that I have shown neither of these locks as samples of\r\nhigh-class goods, but as samples of the furniture fixed in the houses\r\nof the working and middle classes of this country; and when I tell you\r\nthat the American lock, fitted with the mineral furniture, is at least\r\n25 per cent cheaper than the English abortion I have shown to you, you\r\nwill begin to realize what our English markets have to fear from the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nHere is a common, cheap English mortise lock, and you will naturally\r\nask why the outside of this lock is ground bright, when it is buried\r\nin the door and never seen except it has to be taken out for repairs.\r\nI have asked the same question, and for 20 years have paused for a\r\nreply. This lock is not reversible, the follower is not bushed, and\r\nthe inside is rough and cheap. Contrast it with this neat American\r\nlock, and notice again the bosses to receive the wear; notice also\r\nthat the bolts are brass; the latch-bolt is, of course, reversible--I\r\nnever saw an American lock which was not. The body of the lock is cast\r\niron; and, seeing that there are no strains upon a mortise lock, it is\r\nquite as good as if it was of wrought iron. There is no unnecessary\r\ngrinding, but the iron is japanned, and the japan is as much superior\r\nto the English compound as is the lacquer ware of the Japanese to that\r\nwhich is executed in Birmingham and palmed upon the ignorant buyer as\r\nJapanese work. In fact, as you can see for yourselves, the English\r\njapan looks almost like gas tar beside the American. This American\r\nlock is a two-lever, and there is no sham about the key, which is made\r\nof some kind of white metal and is small and neat. This lock is only\r\n2½ per cent higher in price than the English.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving these locks, let me say a word or two upon the\r\nrelative wear upon their different portions, and their relative\r\nsafety. The English maker appears to ignore the fact that\r\nnineteen-twentieths of the wear of a lock is upon the latch, spindle,\r\nand follower; the amount of actual wear upon the rest of the lock is\r\ncomparatively slight. Let any of you consider the number of times you\r\nopen and close a door, compared with the times you lock it. Our\r\ndrawbacks and large rim locks are used about once a day; the great\r\nbulk of our mortise locks are not used, except as latches, once a\r\nweek. One argument used by our manufacturers against the American lock\r\nis that, being made by machinery, there is necessarily a great\r\nduplication of parts, and a consequent lowering of the standard of\r\nsecurity; while their own locks, being made by hand, are not alike,\r\nand therefore cannot be so easily opened.\r\n\r\nLet any of you put this argument to proof, by trying how many front\r\ndoors you can open with one key in a row of workmen's dwellings such\r\nas are found in Manchester, ranging up to £25 rentals, and the result\r\nwill astonish you. If our own manufacturers made their locks\r\nsufficiently well to give this security, there would be some force in\r\nwhat they say; but so far as security is concerned, they might as well\r\nmake their locks by machinery as make them in the way they do.\r\n\r\nI now show you two thumb latches, one of American and one of English\r\nmake. Notice the general finish of the American latch; the shape, the\r\nmode of construction, and everything about it proves that brains were\r\nused when it was designed and made. The English \"Norfolk latch,\" on\r\nthe other hand, is ill designed, uncomfortable in hand, clumsily\r\nfinished, the japan hangs about it in lumps, the latch is clumsy, the\r\ncatch is clumsier, and the keeper, a rough piece of hoop iron, seems\r\nas if designed to \"keep\" the latch from doing its duty. In this case\r\nthe American latch is 25 per cent cheaper than the English one; and\r\nthe English latch is of the same pattern as the one that was in use\r\nwhen I was a boy, only that it is a greatly inferior article.\r\n\r\nI will now introduce you to the well known nuisance which we have been\r\naccustomed to use for fastening our cupboard doors--the cupboard\r\nturn--and without further comment, ask you to compare it with this\r\nneat and simple latch of American make, costing about 5 per cent more,\r\ntwice as efficacious, and five times as durable. In this case no\r\nimprovement has been made in the English fastener. It is just as it\r\nwas when I went to the trade, about 28 years ago, and although many\r\nattempts have been made to improve it they have added so much to its\r\ncost as to prevent the improved articles from coming into general use.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the English and American inventor and designer\r\nseems to consist in this--that while an Englishman devotes all his\r\nenergies to the improvement of an existing shape, the American throws\r\nthe old article under his bench and commences _de novo_.\r\n\r\nI think I have made out a case against the English hardware\r\nmanufacturer, but when I have pointed these matters out to merchants\r\nand ironmongers, I have been met with various reasons for this\r\nmanifest inferiority. I do not know how far these excuses may be\r\nvalid, but one man says that the reason, as regards locks, is somewhat\r\nas follows: The locksmiths of the district wherein they are made in\r\nmany cases work at their own homes; one man making one part of a lock,\r\nwhile other men make other parts. This goes on generation after\r\ngeneration, and the men become mere machines, not knowing how the\r\nentire lock is constructed, and not caring to know. Another attributes\r\nit to the influence of the trades-unions, and says that if a\r\nmanufacturer wants a different kind of lock, the price for the work is\r\nimmediately put higher, even though the actual labor may not be\r\nincreased. A third says it is due to the drunkenness of the hands, and\r\ntheir consequent poverty and physical and social demoralization, which\r\nprevents them from rising to such an intellectual level as will enable\r\nthem to see the evils of their system, and adopt the right means to\r\nremove them. A fourth boldly says, \"We make these goods because our\r\ncustomers want them.\" How far the reasons assigned by the first three\r\nare correct I am unable to say, but for the fourth, the extent to\r\nwhich the builders of England have patronized the Americans is a\r\ncomplete answer.\r\n\r\nThis defense, \"Our customers want them,\" is as old as the hills, and\r\nhas been used to cover every kind of deception and inferior article\r\never manufactured. Our Lancashire manufacturers use it when they are\r\ncharged with sending china clay and mildew (and call it calico) for\r\nthe mild Hindoo and the Heathen Chinee to dress themselves in. Our\r\nbutter merchants use it when they make up grease and call it butter;\r\nand our hardware merchants use it when they send us sham locks, and\r\ncall them brass bushed, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the manufacturer to invent for his customers, and it\r\nis preposterous to say that the builder would prefer that embodiment\r\nof fraud--the English rim-lock, which I showed to you--to the American\r\nlock, which, at any rate, was an honest article, especially when the\r\nlatter had the great advantage of being considerably cheaper. I am\r\nafraid that the swindling and greed of our merchants is having the\r\neffect of thrusting us out of the markets of the world, including our\r\nhome markets; and when it is too late, these men who are making the\r\nname of English goods a byword and a reproach, even among the Hindoos,\r\nthe Chinese, and the untutored savages of the South Sea Islands, will\r\nfind that \"honesty is the best policy.\"\r\n\r\nWe have been accustomed to hear a deal of buncombe talked about the\r\nhonesty of the Englishman, and the want of honesty of the Yankee;\r\nabout the enterprise of our manufacturers and the skill of our\r\nworkmen; but if what I have shown to you is to be taken as a specimen,\r\nit is time we set our house in order. Since commencing the paper I\r\nhave read the discussion between Messrs. Chubb and Hill, and am at a\r\nloss to know why Messrs. Chubb entered into the arena. If all the\r\nEnglish makers tried to reach Chubb's standard we should keep our\r\nmarkets, at least so far as high quality is concerned; and to see\r\nMessrs. Chubb acting as champions of the English lockmakers is\r\nsomething like seeing Messrs. Horrocks taking up the cudgels for those\r\npeople who manufacture china clay and call it calico, the proportion\r\nof fiber in the material being just a little greater than that found\r\nin hair mortar.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wish it to be understood that I bring these facts\r\nbefore you in no exultant spirit. I am an Englishman, and the future\r\nwelfare of myself and my children depends very much upon the future of\r\nEnglish manufactures; but we cannot be blind to the fact that the\r\napathy and conservatism of our manufacturers, the greed of our\r\nMerchants, and the ignorance and drunkenness of our workmen, are\r\nweighing us so heavily in the race for trade that a member of our own\r\nfamily, whose leading business should be to produce food for us, is\r\noutstripping us with the greatest ease. Our boasted supremacy as a\r\nmanufacturing people is leaving us, and leaving us under such\r\nhumiliating circumstances--and if the men of Birmingham and the\r\ndistrict are content to dwell in their present \"fools' paradise,\" it\r\nis the duty of every lover of his country to speak as plainly as\r\npossible to them.\r\n\r\nOf course I am prepared to be told that as I am not a lockmaker my\r\nopinion is worthless; but I have been about 28 years as man and boy,\r\nemployer and workman, in the building trade, and if I have not got to\r\nknow something about builders' hardware during that period, I have\r\nmade but a poor use of my time. I do not know if I have added to your\r\nstock of knowledge, but deeming the subject an important one, I have\r\ndone the best I could in the time at my disposal.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion which followed the opinion of the members present\r\nwas unanimously in favor of the American articles shown to them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA high Indian official reports that the people of Cashmere are dying\r\nof famine like flies, and at the present rate of mortality the\r\nprovince will be nearly depopulated by the end of the year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO INVENTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn experience of more than thirty years, and the preparation of not\r\nless than one hundred thousand applications for patents at home and\r\nabroad, enable us to understand the laws and practice on both\r\ncontinents, and to possess unequaled facilities for procuring patents\r\neverywhere. In addition to our facilities for preparing drawings and\r\nspecifications quickly, the applicant can rest assured that his case\r\nwill be filed in the Patent Office without delay. Every application,\r\nin which the fees have been paid, is sent complete--including the\r\nmodel--to the Patent Office the same day the papers are signed at our\r\noffice, or received by mail, so there is no delay in filing the case,\r\na complaint we often hear from other sources. Another advantage to the\r\ninventor in securing his patent through the Scientific American Patent\r\nAgency, it insures a special notice of the invention in the SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN, which publication often opens negotiations for the sale of\r\nthe patent or manufacture of the article. A synopsis of the patent\r\nlaws in foreign countries may be found on another page, and persons\r\ncontemplating the securing of patents abroad are invited to write to\r\nthis office for prices, which have been reduced in accordance with the\r\ntimes, and our perfected facilities for conducting the business.\r\nAddress MUNN & CO., office SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSINESS AND PERSONAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Charge for Insertion under this head is One Dollar a line for\r\neach insertion; about eight words to a line.

Q.--The speed of a circular saw at the periphery should be from\r\n6,000 to 7,000 feet per minute. The number of revolutions per minute\r\nwill of course vary with the diameter of the saw.\r\n\r\n(2) T. J. F. asks (1) for the best way to fasten emery on a wooden\r\nwheel, to be used in place of a solid emery wheel. A. Cover the wheel\r\nwith leather devoid of grease, and coat the leather surface, a portion\r\nat a time, with good glue; immediately roll the glued surface in emery\r\nspread out on a board. 2. How can I fasten small pieces of looking\r\nglass on iron? A. Use equal parts of pitch and gutta percha together.\r\n\r\n(3) W. C. asks: 1. What is the power of the simple electric light\r\ndescribed in SUPPLEMENT NO. 149? A. When supplied with a strong\r\ncurrent it is equal to 5 or 6 5-foot gas burners. It is designed for\r\ntemporary use only. 2. What is the cost of manufacturing the\r\ndynamo-electric machine in SUPPLEMENT NO. 161? A. The one shown in the\r\narticle referred to cost about $35.\r\n\r\n(4) L. D. asks: 1. Which is the better conductor, silver or copper? A.\r\nSilver. 2. And the comparative resistance offered to the electric\r\ncurrent by water and the above? A. Taking pure silver as 100,000,000,\r\nthe conductivity of distilled water would be 0.01.\r\n\r\n(5) H. J. F. writes: In SUPPLEMENT 162 a simple electric light is\r\ndescribed. I wish to light a room 20×20×10 feet. 1. How large is the\r\nbell glass? A. 2½ inches. 2. Can I use battery carbon? A. Use a\r\ncarbon pencil made for electric lamps. 3. How can I make tray water\r\ntight after putting wire through? A. With gutta percha. 4. I have one\r\nlarge cell Bunsen and one Smee. How many more and of what kind shall I\r\nget? A. One of the batteries described in SUPPLEMENTS 157, 158, 159,\r\nwill do, probably 8 or 10 Bunsen elements would be the best.\r\n\r\n(6) W. B. F. writes: I tried to make an electric pen, like the one\r\ndescribed in your SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, of February 22d, 1879, using a\r\nSmee's battery, a circuit breaker, and an induction coil, but it did\r\nnot work. Is there anything wrong, or is a condenser different from an\r\ninduction coil? A. A condenser consists of a number of sheets of tin\r\nfoil separated from each other by larger sheets of paper. One half of\r\nthe tin foil sheets are connected with one terminal of the primary\r\ncoil, the other half with the other terminal; the tin foil sheets\r\nconnected with one terminal alternate with those of the other\r\nterminal. The condenser is essential to the working of the coil. For\r\ncomplete directions for making induction coils, see SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN SUPPLEMENT NO. 160.\r\n\r\n(7) J. De F. asks: 1. Knowing the resistance of a wire of given\r\nconductivity, length, and diameter, will the resistance of any other\r\nwire be in proportion inversely? A. Yes. 2. Is there heat enough\r\ndeveloped in the secondary coil of an induction coil to prevent the\r\nuse of paraffine as an insulating material? A. With proper battery\r\npower, no. 3. How high in the list of non-conductors does paraffine\r\nstand? A. It is one of the best. 4. Will a cotton insulator soaked in\r\nparaffine answer as well as silk? A. No, because it renders the\r\ncovering of the wire too thick. 5. Can you recommend any insulating\r\nmaterial for making induction coils which will dry rapidly? A.\r\nAlcoholic shellac varnish. Rosin to which a little beeswax has been\r\nadded is an excellent insulator; it must be applied in a melted state.\r\n6. What is the composition of the black material covering the\r\nLeclanche porous cell? A. Gutta percha. 7. Is the magneto-electric\r\nmachine described in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT patented? A.\r\nTo which do you refer? Most, if not all of them are patented.\r\n\r\n(8) B. V. F. writes: With reference to item 8, on page 139, of\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, March 1, 1879, I think there is some mistake\r\nabout the coal you think required to heat 1,000 cubic feet space. I\r\nburn some 8 tons coal to heat, in the whole year, such part of my\r\nhouse as must exceed 25×20×18=9,000 cubic feet. We keep up a moderate\r\nheat at night. Ventilate more than most families do; take part only of\r\nthe cool air, and only in part of the coldest weather, from the\r\ncellar, which at such times is opened into the main entries. House\r\nwood, back plastered, and stands alone. If 100 lbs. coal would heat\r\n1,000 feet one day, I ought to burn 900 lbs. a day, or nearly 14 tons\r\nin December and 14 more in January. A. We are glad to receive these\r\ndata, which correspond quite closely with some obtained by recent\r\naccurate experiments. The estimate given in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\r\nalso agrees well with experiments on the use of hot air heaters for\r\nvery small buildings or rooms. Of course, the larger the space to be\r\nheated, the more economically it can generally be done.\r\n\r\n(9) W. M. S. asks: Will the coil described in SUPPLEMENT NO. 160 do\r\nfor the electric pen described in a recent number of the SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN? If not how must it be changed? A. It is too large; make it\r\none half the size given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n(10) B. G.--In reply to your inquiry as to Mr. Stroh's telephone\r\nexperiment, we give the following, which we clip from the _English\r\nMechanic_: A singular experimental effect, of special interest just\r\nnow from its possible bearing on the theory of the source of sound in\r\nthe Bell telephone, has just been observed by Mr. Stroh, the well\r\nknown mechanician. If a telephone, T, with the circuit of its coil\r\nleft open, be held to the ear, and a powerful magnet, M, be moved\r\ngently up and down along the length of the magnet, as shown by the\r\narrow, and at a distance of an inch or two from it, a faint breathing\r\nsound will be heard, the recurring pulses of sound keeping time with\r\nthe up and down motion of the magnet. The sound may be aptly compared\r\nto the steady breathing of a child, and there is a striking\r\nresemblance between it and the microphonic sounds of gases diffusing\r\nthrough a porous septum as heard by Mr. Chandler Roberts. We\r\nunderstand that Professor Hughes is investigating the cause of this\r\ncurious sound by help of the microphone.\r\n\r\n(11) \"Enterprise\" asks: What part of its volume will iron expand in\r\npassing from a temperature of 60° to melting temperature? A. The\r\ncubical expansion of iron for each degree (C.) between 0° and 100° is\r\n0.00003546 of its volume, its volume being 1. This ratio however,\r\nincreases somewhat at higher temperatures, since the mean coefficient\r\nof expansion for each degree between 0° C. and 300° C. is 0.00004405.\r\nThe question you ask has probably never been settled. You may form an\r\napproximation by the use of the above ratios, knowing the melting\r\npoint of the iron.\r\n\r\n(12) P. L. O. asks for a good chemistry for a beginner to study\r\nwithout a teacher. A. Fownes' \"Chemistry;\" Gorup-Besanez, \"Inorganic,\r\nOrganic and Physiological Chemistry.\"\r\n\r\n(13) L. E. M. asks: What is the best method of keeping fine guns from\r\nrusting, and what oil should be used? A. For the outside, clear gum\r\ncopal 1 part, oil of rosemary 1 part, absolute alcohol 3 parts. Clean\r\nand heat the metal and apply a flowing coat of the liquid by means of\r\na camel's hair brush. Do not handle until the coat becomes dry and\r\nhard. For the inside of the barrel a trace of refined sperm oil is as\r\ngood as anything, but an excess should be avoided.\r\n\r\n(14) A. H. B. asks how much weight, falling 10 feet, will be required\r\nto produce one horse power for five hours? A. One horse power for 5\r\nhours = 33,000 × 300 = 9,900,000 foot pounds--so that the weight\r\nrequired is 9,900,000 ÷ 10 = 990,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n(15) A. D. R. asks: 1. In renewing a Leclanche battery, do the zincs\r\nhave to be amalgamated? A. They are usually amalgamated. 2. Will two\r\ncells large size Leclanche battery give any light, using the simple\r\nlamp described in SUPPLEMENT NO. 162? A. No.\r\n\r\n(16) H. L. J. writes: In a recent issue of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN you\r\nstate that the floating of solid iron on melted iron is on the same\r\nprinciple as the floating of ice in water. I do not quite understand\r\nhow it can be. Please explain. A. Solid iron, at an elevated\r\ntemperature, floats upon molten iron for the same reason that ice\r\nfloats upon molten ice-water--because it is specifically lighter. You\r\nwill find the subject discussed at length in Tyndall's \"Heat as a Mode\r\nof Motion.\"\r\n\r\n(17) J. W. will find full directions for canning corn, etc., on p. 394\r\n(4), vol. 39, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n(18) \"Amateur\" writes: I wish to make some small bells that have a\r\nclear ring. What metal or metals can I use that I can melt easily? A.\r\nUse an alloy of tin and antimony. See SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT\r\nNO. 17.\r\n\r\n(19) H.--A nutritious mixed diet is unquestionably the best, care\r\nbeing taken to avoid an excess of meat.\r\n\r\n(20) W. F. writes: I have made an engine, and would like to find out\r\nwhat size of boiler it will require. The cylinder has 2¼ inch bore and\r\n3 inches stroke. A. It depends upon pressure and speed to be\r\nmaintained; probably a vertical tubular boiler, 15 inches diameter,\r\nand 32 to 36 inches high, would suit you.\r\n\r\n(21) R. G. (Salt Lake).--Please send full name.\r\n\r\n(22) J. M. G. asks: If two persons each pull one hundred pounds on\r\nopposite ends of a rope, what will be the strain on the rope? A. The\r\nstrain on the rope will be 100 lbs.\r\n\r\n(23) W. M. M. asks: In laying off a mill stone in furrows, what\r\ndraught is given? What amount of the space of a stone is given to\r\nfurrows and what to grinding surface? A. There is considerable\r\ndifference in the practice of various millers, and we would be glad to\r\nreceive communications from those experienced in the art of dressing\r\nmillstones.\r\n\r\nMINERALS, ETC.--Specimens have been received from the following\r\ncorrespondents, and examined, with the results stated:\r\n\r\nS.

SMITH HOBART, President.         JOHN C. MOSS, Superintendent.\r\n\r\nTYPE-METAL RELIEF PLATES.\r\nA SUPERIOR SUBSTITUTE FOR WOOD-CUTS\r\nAT MUCH LOWER PRICES.\r\n\r\nPersons desiring illustrations for Books, Newspapers, Catalogues,\r\nAdvertisements, or for any other purposes, can have their work done by\r\nus promptly and in the best style.\r\n\r\nOUR RELIEF PLATES are engraved by photo-chemical means; are mounted on\r\nblocks type-high ready for use on any ordinary press, and will wear\r\nlonger than the common stereotype plates.\r\n\r\nThey have a perfectly smooth printing surface, and the lines are _as\r\ndeep, as even,_ and _as sharp_ as they could possibly be cut by hand.\r\n\r\nELECTROTYPES may be made from them in the same manner as from\r\nwood-cuts.\r\n\r\nCOPY. The engraving is done either from prints or pen-drawings. Almost\r\nall kinds of prints can be re-engraved directly from the copy,\r\nprovided they be in _clear, black lines_ or stipple, and on _white_ or\r\nonly slightly tinted paper.\r\n\r\nPen drawings, suitable for engraving by us, must be made with\r\n_thoroughly_ BLACK ink, on _smooth, white_ paper. They should usually\r\nbe made twice the length and twice the width of the plates desired.\r\n\r\nWhen such drawings cannot be furnished us, we can produce them from\r\nphotographs, pencil sketches, or designs of any kind accompanied with\r\nproper instructions. Photographs taken in the usual way, and of any\r\nconvenient size, we can use.\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF SIZE.--Wood-cut prints of the coarser kind may often be\r\nreduced to half their lineal dimensions, while others will admit of\r\nvery little reduction, and some of none at all.\r\n\r\nMost lithographic and steel-plate prints will admit of no reduction.\r\n\r\nVery fine prints of any kind may be _enlarged_ moderately without\r\ndetriment.\r\n\r\nAny prints which cannot be satisfactorily reduced or enlarged may be\r\n_redrawn_ and thus brought to any desired size.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of reduction and enlargement, the relative proportions\r\nremain unchanged.\r\n\r\nPROOFS.--Whenever desired, we will furnish tintype proofs of the\r\ndrawings made by us, for approval or correction, before engraving. A\r\nprinted proof is furnished with each plate.\r\n\r\nTIME.--We cannot usually engage to fill an order for a single plate in\r\nless than from three to six days; larger orders will require longer\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nESTIMATES will be promptly furnished when desired. That these may be\r\ndefinite and correct, the copy to be used--whether print, photograph,\r\nsketch, or drawing--should always be submitted for our examination,\r\ntogether with a distinct statement of the size of plate wanted, and of\r\nany other details to be observed.\r\n\r\nTERMS.--To insure attention, all orders must be accompanied by an\r\nadvance of half the price charged, the balance to be paid on delivery.\r\n\r\nELECTROTYPING AND PRINTING.--We have recently added to our\r\nestablishment excellent facilities for making electrotypes, and also\r\nthree power presses specially fitted for printing plates of all sizes\r\nin the finest manner.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL LIGHT.--We have just introduced this most important\r\nfacility, which enables us to prosecute our work _in cloudy weather_,\r\nand to push forward hurried orders _in the night_.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.--Our plates are now used by the principal publishers in\r\nthis city, and by most of the leading houses in every State in the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nOUR GENERAL CIRCULAR contains a few specimens of the various kinds of\r\nour work, and will be sent on receipt of stamp.

Pittsburgh, Pa., Manufacturers of improved\r\nwrought iron Beams and Girders (patented).\r\n\r\nThe great fall which has taken place in the prices of Iron, and\r\nespecially in Beams used in the construction of FIRE PROOF BUILDINGS,\r\ninduces us to call the special attention of Engineers, Architects, and\r\nBuilders to the undoubted advantages of now erecting Fire Proof\r\nstructures; and by reference to pages 52 & 54 of our Book of\r\nSections--which will be sent on application to those contemplating the\r\nerection of fire proof buildings--THE COST CAN BE ACCURATELY\r\nCALCULATED, the cost of Insurance avoided, and the serious losses and\r\ninterruption to business caused by fire; these and like considerations\r\nfully justify any additional first cost.
