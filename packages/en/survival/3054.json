The materials for\r\nthis volume were collected in part during the outward voyage, when the\r\n“Beagle” called at St. Jago in the Cape de Verde Islands, and St.\r\nPaul’s Rocks, and at Fernando Noronha, but mainly during the homeward\r\ncruise; then it was that the Galapagos Islands were surveyed, the Low\r\nArchipelago passed through, and Tahiti visited; after making calls at\r\nthe Bay of Islands, in New Zealand, and also at Sydney, Hobart Town and\r\nKing George’s Sound in Australia, the “Beagle” sailed across the Indian\r\nOcean to the little group of the Keeling or Cocos Islands, which Darwin\r\nhas rendered famous by his observations, and thence to Mauritius;\r\ncalling at the Cape of Good Hope on her way, the ship then proceeded\r\nsuccessively to St. Helena and Ascension, and revisited the Cape de\r\nVerde Islands before finally reaching England.\r\n\r\nAlthough Darwin was thus able to gratify his curiosity by visits to a\r\ngreat number of very interesting volcanic districts, the voyage opened\r\nfor him with a bitter disappointment. He had been reading Humboldt’s\r\n“Personal Narrative” during his last year’s residence in Cambridge, and\r\nhad copied out from it long passages about Teneriffe. He was actually\r\nmaking inquiries as to the best means of visiting that island, when the\r\noffer was made to him to accompany Captain Fitzroy in the “Beagle. “\r\nHis friend Henslow too, on parting with him, had given him the advice\r\nto procure and read the recently published first volume of the\r\n“Principles of Geology,” though he warned him against accepting the\r\nviews advocated by its author. During the time the “Beagle” was beating\r\nbackwards and forwards when the voyage commenced, Darwin, although\r\nhardly ever able to leave his berth, was employing all the\r\nopportunities which the terrible sea-sickness left him, in studying\r\nHumboldt and Lyell. We may therefore form an idea of his feelings when,\r\non the ship reaching Santa Cruz, and the Peak of Teneriffe making its\r\nappearance among the clouds, they were suddenly informed that an\r\noutbreak of cholera would prevent any landing!\r\n\r\nAmple compensation for this disappointment was found, however, when the\r\nship reached Porta Praya in St. Jago, the largest of the Cape de Verde\r\nIslands. Here he spent three most delightful weeks, and really\r\ncommenced his work as a geologist and naturalist. Writing to his father\r\nhe says, “Geologising in a volcanic country is most delightful; besides\r\nthe interest attached to itself, it leads you into most beautiful and\r\nretired spots. Nobody but a person fond of Natural History can imagine\r\nthe pleasure of strolling under cocoa-nuts in a thicket of bananas and\r\ncoffee-plants, and an endless number of wild flowers. And this island,\r\nthat has given me so much instruction and delight, is reckoned the most\r\nuninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch at during our voyage.\r\nIt certainly is generally very barren, but the valleys are more\r\nexquisitely beautiful, from the very contrast. It is utterly useless to\r\nsay anything about the scenery; it would be as profitable to explain to\r\na blind man colours, as to a person who has not been out of Europe, the\r\ntotal dissimilarity of a tropical view. Whenever I enjoy anything, I\r\nalways look forward to writing it down, either in my log-book (which\r\nincreases in bulk), or in a letter; so you must excuse raptures, and\r\nthose raptures badly expressed. I find my collections are increasing\r\nwonderfully, and from Rio I think I shall be obliged to send a cargo\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nThe indelible impression made on Darwin’s mind by this first visit to a\r\nvolcanic island, is borne witness to by a remarkable passage in the\r\n“Autobiography” written by him in 1876. “The geology of St. Jago is\r\nvery striking, yet simple; a stream of lava formerly flowed over the\r\nbed of the sea, formed of triturated recent shells and corals, which it\r\nhas baked into a hard white rock. Since then the whole island has been\r\nupheaved. But the line of white rock revealed to me a new and important\r\nfact, namely that there had been afterwards subsidence round the\r\ncraters which had since been in action, and had poured forth lava. It\r\nthen first dawned on me that I might perhaps write a book on the\r\ngeology of the various countries visited, and this made me thrill with\r\ndelight. That was a memorable hour to me, and how distinctly I can call\r\nto mind the low cliff of lava beneath which I rested, with the sun\r\nglaring hot, a few strange desert plants growing near and with living\r\ncorals in the tidal pools at my feet.”\r\n\r\nOnly five years before, when listening to poor Professor Jameson’s\r\nlectures on the effete Wernerianism, which at that time did duty for\r\ngeological teaching, Darwin had found them “incredibly dull,” and he\r\ndeclared that “the sole effect they produced on me was a determination\r\nnever so long as I lived to read a book on Geology, or in any way to\r\nstudy the science.”\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast we find in the expressions which he makes use of in\r\nreferring to Geological Science, in his letters written home from the\r\n“Beagle!” After alluding to the delight of collecting and studying\r\nmarine animals, he exclaims, “But Geology carries the day!” Writing to\r\nHenslow he says, “I am quite charmed with Geology, but, like the wise\r\nanimal between two bundles of hay, I do not know which to like best;\r\nthe old crystalline group of rocks, or the softer and more\r\nfossiliferous beds.” And just as the long voyage is about to come to a\r\nclose he again writes, “I find in Geology a never-failing interest; as\r\nit has been remarked, it creates the same grand ideas respecting this\r\nworld which Astronomy does for the Universe.” In this passage Darwin\r\ndoubtless refers to a remark of Sir John Herschel’s in his admirable\r\n“Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy,”—a book\r\nwhich exercised a most remarkable and beneficial influence on the mind\r\nof the young naturalist.\r\n\r\nIf there cannot be any doubt as to the strong predilection in Darwin’s\r\nmind for geological studies, both during and after the memorable\r\nvoyage, there is equally little difficulty in perceiving the school of\r\ngeological thought which, in spite of the warnings of Sedgwick and\r\nHenslow, had obtained complete ascendancy over his mind. He writes in\r\n1876: “The very first place which I examined, namely St. Jago in the\r\nCape de Verde Islands, showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of\r\nLyell’s manner of treating Geology, compared with that of any other\r\nauthor, whose works I had with me, or ever afterwards read.” And again,\r\n“The science of Geology is enormously indebted to Lyell—more so, as I\r\nbelieve, than to any other man who ever lived...I am proud to remember\r\nthat the first place, namely, St. Jago, in the Cape de Verde\r\nArchipelago, in which I geologised, convinced me of the infinite\r\nsuperiority of Lyell’s views over those advocated in any other work\r\nknown to me.”\r\n\r\nThe passages I have cited will serve to show the spirit in which Darwin\r\nentered upon his geological studies, and the perusal of the following\r\npages will furnish abundant proofs of the enthusiasm, acumen, and\r\ncaution with which his researches were pursued.\r\n\r\nLarge collections of rocks and minerals were made by Darwin during his\r\nresearches, and sent home to Cambridge, to be kept under the care of\r\nhis faithful friend Henslow. After visiting his relations and friends,\r\nDarwin’s first care on his return to England was to unpack and examine\r\nthese collections. He accordingly, at the end of 1836, took lodgings\r\nfor three months in Fitzwilliam Street, Cambridge, so as to be near\r\nHenslow; and in studying and determining his geological specimens\r\nreceived much valuable aid from the eminent crystallographer and\r\nmineralogist, Professor William Hallows Miller.\r\n\r\nThe actual writing of the volume upon volcanic islands was not\r\ncommenced till 1843, when Darwin had settled in the spot which became\r\nhis home for the rest of his life—the famous house at Down, in Kent.\r\nWriting to his friend Mr. Fox, on March 28th, 1843, he says, “I am very\r\nslowly progressing with a volume, or rather pamphlet, on the volcanic\r\nislands which we visited: I manage only a couple of hours per day, and\r\nthat not very regularly. It is uphill work writing books, which cost\r\nmoney in publishing, and which are not read even by geologists.”\r\n\r\nThe work occupied Darwin during the whole of the year 1843, and was\r\nissued in the spring of the following year, the actual time engaged in\r\npreparing it being recorded in his diary as “from the summer of 1842 to\r\nJanuary 1844;” but the author does not appear to have been by any means\r\nsatisfied with the result when the book was finished. He wrote to\r\nLyell, “You have pleased me much by saying that you intend looking\r\nthrough my ‘Volcanic Islands;’ it cost me eighteen months!!! and I have\r\nheard of very few who have read it. Now I shall feel, whatever little\r\n(and little it is) there is confirmatory of old work, or new, will work\r\nits effect and not be lost.” To Sir Joseph Hooker he wrote, “I have\r\njust finished a little volume on the volcanic islands which we visited.\r\nI do not know how far you care for dry simple geology, but I hope you\r\nwill let me send you a copy.”\r\n\r\nEvery geologist knows how full of interest and suggestiveness is this\r\nbook of Darwin’s on volcanic islands. Probably the scant satisfaction\r\nwhich its author seemed to find in it may be traced to the effect of a\r\ncontrast which he felt between the memory of glowing delights he had\r\nexperienced when, hammer in hand, he roamed over new and interesting\r\nscenes, and the slow, laborious, and less congenial task of re-writing\r\nand arranging his notes in book-form.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, in writing an account of the ancient volcanoes of the\r\nHebrides, I had frequent occasion to quote Mr. Darwin’s observations on\r\nthe Atlantic volcanoes, in illustration of the phenomena exhibited by\r\nthe relics of still older volcanoes in our own islands. Darwin, in\r\nwriting to his old friend Sir Charles Lyell upon the subject, says, “I\r\nwas not a little pleased to see my volcanic book quoted, for I thought\r\nit was completely dead and forgotten.”\r\n\r\nTwo years later the original publishers of this book and of that on\r\nSouth America proposed to re-issue them. Darwin at first hesitated, for\r\nhe seemed to think there could be little of abiding interest in them;\r\nhe consulted me upon the subject in one of the conversations which I\r\nused to have with him at that time, and I strongly urged upon him the\r\nreprint of the works. I was much gratified when he gave way upon the\r\npoint, and consented to their appearing just as originally issued. In\r\nhis preface he says, “Owing to the great progress which Geology has\r\nmade in recent times, my views on some few points may be somewhat\r\nantiquated, but I have thought it best to leave them as they originally\r\nappeared.”\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to indicate, as briefly as possible, the chief\r\ngeological problem upon which the publication of Darwin’s “Volcanic\r\nIslands” threw new and important light. The merit of the work consisted\r\nin supplying interesting observations, which in some cases have proved\r\nof crucial value in exploding prevalent fallacies; in calling attention\r\nto phenomena and considerations that had been quite overlooked by\r\ngeologists, but have since exercised an important influence in moulding\r\ngeological speculation; and lastly in showing the importance which\r\nattaches to small and seemingly insignificant causes, some of which\r\nafford a key to the explanation of very curious geological problems.\r\n\r\nVisiting as he did the districts in which Von Buch and others had found\r\nwhat they thought to be evidence of the truth of “Elevation-craters,”\r\nDarwin was able to show that the facts were capable of a totally\r\ndifferent interpretation. The views originally put forward by the old\r\nGerman geologist and traveller, and almost universally accepted by his\r\ncountrymen, had met with much support from Elie de Beaumont and\r\nDufrenoy, the leaders of geological thought in France. They were,\r\nhowever, stoutly opposed by Scrope and Lyell in this country, and by\r\nConstant Prevost and Virlet on the other side of the channel. Darwin,\r\nin the work before us, shows how little ground there is for the\r\nassumption that the great ring-craters of the Atlantic islands have\r\noriginated in gigantic blisters of the earth’s surface which, opening\r\nat the top, have given origin to the craters. Admitting the influence\r\nof the injection of lava into the structure of the volcanic cones, in\r\nincreasing their bulk and elevation, he shows that, in the main, the\r\nvolcanoes are built up by repeated ejections causing an accumulation of\r\nmaterials around the vent.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, agreeing on the whole with Scrope and Lyell, as to the\r\nexplosive origin of ordinary volcanic craters, Darwin clearly saw that,\r\nin some cases, great craters might be formed or enlarged, by the\r\nsubsidence of the floors after eruptions. The importance of this\r\nagency, to which too little attention has been directed by geologists,\r\nhas recently been shown by Professor Dana, in his admirable work on\r\nKilauea and the other great volcanoes of the Hawaiian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe effects of subsidence at a volcanic centre in producing a downward\r\ndip of the strata around it, was first pointed out by Darwin, as the\r\nresult of his earliest work in the Cape de Verde Islands. Striking\r\nillustrations of the same principle have since been pointed out by M.\r\nRobert and others in Iceland, by Mr. Heaphy in New Zealand, and by\r\nmyself in the Western Isles of Scotland.\r\n\r\nDarwin again and again called attention to the evidence that volcanic\r\nvents exhibit relations to one another which can only be explained by\r\nassuming the existence of lines of fissure in the earth’s crust, along\r\nwhich the lavas have made their way to the surface. But he, at the same\r\ntime, clearly saw that there was no evidence of the occurrence of great\r\ndeluges of lava along such fissures; he showed how the most remarkable\r\nplateaux, composed of successive lava sheets, might be built up by\r\nrepeated and moderate ejections from numerous isolated vents; and he\r\nexpressly insists upon the rapidity with which the cinder-cones around\r\nthe orifices of ejection and the evidences of successive outflows of\r\nlava would be obliterated by denudation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking parts of the book is that in which he deals\r\nwith the effects of denudation in producing “basal wrecks” or worn down\r\nstumps of volcanoes. He was enabled to examine a series of cases in\r\nwhich could be traced every gradation, from perfect volcanic cones down\r\nto the solidified plugs which had consolidated in the vents from which\r\nejections had taken place. Darwin’s observations on these points have\r\nbeen of the greatest value and assistance to all who have essayed to\r\nstudy the effects of volcanic action during earlier periods of the\r\nearth’s history. Like Lyell, he was firmly persuaded of the continuity\r\nof geological history, and ever delighted in finding indications, in\r\nthe present order of nature, that the phenomena of the past could be\r\naccounted for by means of causes which are still in operation. Lyell’s\r\nlast work in the field was carried on about his home in Forfarshire,\r\nand only a few months before his death he wrote to Darwin: “All the\r\nwork which I have done has confirmed me in the belief that the only\r\ndifference between Palaeozoic and recent volcanic rocks is no more than\r\nwe must allow for, by the enormous time to which the products of the\r\noldest volcanoes have been subjected to chemical changes.”\r\n\r\nDarwin was greatly impressed, as the result of his studies of volcanic\r\nphenomena, followed by an examination of the great granite-masses of\r\nthe Andes, with the relations between the so-called Plutonic rocks and\r\nthose of undoubtedly volcanic origin. It was indeed a fortunate\r\ncircumstance, that after studying some excellent examples of recent\r\nvolcanic rocks, he proceeded to examine in South America many fine\r\nillustrations of the older igneous rock-masses, and especially of the\r\nmost highly crystalline types of the same, and then on his way home had\r\nopportunities of reviving the impression made upon him by the fresh and\r\nunaltered volcanic rocks. Some of the general considerations suggested\r\nby these observations were discussed in a paper read by him before the\r\nGeological Society, on March 7th, 1838, under the title “On the\r\nConnection of Certain Volcanic Phenomena, and On the Formation of\r\nMountain-chains, and the Effect of Continental Elevations.” The exact\r\nbearing of these two classes of facts upon one another are more fully\r\ndiscussed in his book on South American geology.\r\n\r\nThe proofs of recent elevation around many of the volcanic islands led\r\nDarwin to conclude that volcanic areas were, as a rule, regions in\r\nwhich upward movements were taking place, and he was naturally led to\r\ncontrast them with the areas in which, as he showed, the occurrence of\r\natolls, encircling reefs, and barrier-reefs afford indication of\r\nsubsidence. In this way he was able to map out the oceanic areas in\r\ndifferent zones, along which opposite kinds of movement were taking\r\nplace. His conclusions on this subject were full of novelty and\r\nsuggestiveness.\r\n\r\nVery clearly did Darwin recognise the importance of the fact that most\r\nof the oceanic islands appear to be of volcanic origin, though he was\r\ncareful to point out the remarkable exceptions which somewhat\r\ninvalidate the generalisation. In his “Origin of Species” he has\r\nelaborated the idea and suggested the theory of the permanence of\r\nocean-basins, a suggestion which has been adopted and pushed farther by\r\nsubsequent authors, than we think its originator would have approved.\r\nHis caution and fairness of mind on this and similar speculative\r\nquestions was well-known to all who were in the habit of discussing\r\nthem with him.\r\n\r\nSome years before the voyage of the “Beagle,” Mr. Poulett Scrope had\r\npointed out the remarkable analogies that exist between certain igneous\r\nrocks of banded structure, as seen in the Ponza Islands, and the\r\nfoliated crystalline schists. It does not appear that Darwin was\r\nacquainted with this remarkable memoir, but quite independently he\r\ncalled attention to the same phenomena when he came to study some very\r\nsimilar rocks which occur in the island of Ascension. Coming fresh from\r\nthe study of the great masses of crystalline schist in the South\r\nAmerican continent, he was struck by the circumstance that in the\r\nundoubtedly igneous rocks of Ascension we find a similar separation of\r\nthe constituent minerals along parallel “folia.” These observations led\r\nDarwin to the same conclusion as that arrived at some time before by\r\nScrope—namely that when crystallisation takes place in rock masses\r\nunder the influence of great deforming stresses, a separation and\r\nparallel arrangement of the constituent minerals will result. This is a\r\nprocess which is now fully recognised as having been a potent factor in\r\nthe production of the metamorphic rock, and has been called by more\r\nrecent writers “dynamo-metamorphism.”\r\n\r\nIn this, and in many similar discussions, in which exact mineralogical\r\nknowledge was required, it is remarkable how successful Darwin was in\r\nmaking out the true facts with regard to the rocks he studied by the\r\nsimple aid of a penknife and pocket-lens, supplemented by a few\r\nchemical tests and the constant use of the blowpipe. Since his day, the\r\nmethod of study of rocks by thin sections under the microscope has been\r\ndevised, and has become a most efficient aid in all petrographical\r\ninquiries. During the voyage of H.M.S. “Challenger,” many of the\r\nislands studied by Darwin have been revisited and their rocks\r\ncollected. The results of their study by one of the greatest masters of\r\nthe science of micropetrography—Professor Renard of Brussels—have been\r\nrecently published in one of the volumes of “Reports on the\r\n‘Challenger’ Expedition.” While much that is new and valuable has been\r\ncontributed to geological science by these more recent investigations,\r\nand many changes have been made in nomenclature and other points of\r\ndetail, it is interesting to find that all the chief facts described by\r\nDarwin and his friend Professor Miller have stood the test of time and\r\nfurther study, and remain as a monument of the acumen and accuracy in\r\nminute observation of these pioneers in geological research.\r\n\r\nJOHN W. JUDD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nST. JAGO, IN THE CAPE DE VERDE ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks of the lowest series. A calcareous sedimentary deposit, with\r\nrecent shells, altered by the contact of superincumbent lava, its\r\nhorizontality and extent. Subsequent volcanic eruptions, associated\r\nwith calcareous matter in an earthy and fibrous form, and often\r\nenclosed within the separate cells of the scoriae. Ancient and\r\nobliterated orifices of eruption of small size. Difficulty of tracing\r\nover a bare plain recent streams of lava. Inland hills of more ancient\r\nvolcanic rock. Decomposed olivine in large masses. Feldspathic rocks\r\nbeneath the upper crystalline basaltic strata. Uniform structure and\r\nform of the more ancient volcanic hills. Form of the valleys near the\r\ncoast. Conglomerate now forming on the sea beach.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 1: MAP 1: PART OF ST. JAGO, ONE OF THE CAPE DE VERDE ISLANDS.)\r\n\r\nThe island of St. Jago extends in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, thirty\r\nmiles in length by about twelve in breadth. My observations, made\r\nduring two visits, were confined to the southern portion within the\r\ndistance of a few leagues from Porto Praya. The country, viewed from\r\nthe sea, presents a varied outline: smooth conical hills of a reddish\r\ncolour (like Red Hill in Figure 1 (Map 1). (The outline of the coast,\r\nthe position of the villages, streamlets, and of most of the hills in\r\nthis woodcut, are copied from the chart made on board H.M.S. “Leven.”\r\nThe square-topped hills (A, B, C, etc.) are put in merely by eye, to\r\nillustrate my description.)), and others less regular, flat-topped, and\r\nof a blackish colour (like A, B, C,) rise from successive, step-formed\r\nplains of lava. At a distance, a chain of mountains, many thousand feet\r\nin height, traverses the interior of the island. There is no active\r\nvolcano in St. Jago, and only one in the group, namely at Fogo. The\r\nisland since being inhabited has not suffered from destructive\r\nearthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe lowest rocks exposed on the coast near Porto Praya, are highly\r\ncrystalline and compact; they appear to be of ancient, submarine,\r\nvolcanic origin; they are unconformably covered by a thin, irregular,\r\ncalcareous deposit, abounding with shells of a late tertiary period;\r\nand this again is capped by a wide sheet of basaltic lava, which has\r\nflowed in successive streams from the interior of the island, between\r\nthe square-topped hills marked A, B, C, etc. Still more recent streams\r\nof lava have been erupted from the scattered cones, such as Red and\r\nSignal Post Hills. The upper strata of the square-topped hills are\r\nintimately related in mineralogical composition, and in other respects,\r\nwith the lowest series of the coast- rocks, with which they seem to be\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ROCKS OF THE LOWEST SERIES.\r\n\r\nThese rocks possess an extremely varying character; they consist of\r\nblack, brown, and grey, compact, basaltic bases, with numerous crystals\r\nof augite, hornblende, olivine, mica, and sometimes glassy feldspar. A\r\ncommon variety is almost entirely composed of crystals of augite with\r\nolivine. Mica, it is known, seldom occurs where augite abounds; nor\r\nprobably does the present case offer a real exception, for the mica (at\r\nleast in my best characterised specimen, in which one nodule of this\r\nmineral is nearly half an inch in length) is as perfectly rounded as a\r\npebble in a conglomerate, and evidently has not been crystallised in\r\nthe base, in which it is now enclosed, but has proceeded from the\r\nfusion of some pre-existing rock. These compact lavas alternate with\r\ntuffs, amygdaloids, and wacke, and in some places with coarse\r\nconglomerate. Some of the argillaceous wackes are of a dark green\r\ncolour, others, pale yellowish-green, and others nearly white; I was\r\nsurprised to find that some of the latter varieties, even where\r\nwhitest, fused into a jet black enamel, whilst some of the green\r\nvarieties afforded only a pale gray bead. Numerous dikes, consisting\r\nchiefly of highly compact augitic rocks, and of gray amygdaloidal\r\nvarieties, intersect the strata, which have in several places been\r\ndislocated with considerable violence, and thrown into highly inclined\r\npositions. One line of disturbance crosses the northern end of Quail\r\nIsland (an islet in the Bay of Porto Praya), and can be followed to the\r\nmainland. These disturbances took place before the deposition of the\r\nrecent sedimentary bed; and the surface, also, had previously been\r\ndenuded to a great extent, as is shown by many truncated dikes.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE CALCAREOUS DEPOSIT OVERLYING THE FOREGOING VOLCANIC\r\nROCKS.\r\n\r\nThis stratum is very conspicuous from its white colour, and from the\r\nextreme regularity with which it ranges in a horizontal line for some\r\nmiles along the coast. Its average height above the sea, measured from\r\nthe upper line of junction with the superincumbent basaltic lava, is\r\nabout sixty feet; and its thickness, although varying much from the\r\ninequalities of the underlying formation, may be estimated at about\r\ntwenty feet. It consists of quite white calcareous matter, partly\r\ncomposed of organic debris, and partly of a substance which may be\r\naptly compared in appearance with mortar. Fragments of rock and pebbles\r\nare scattered throughout this bed, often forming, especially in the\r\nlower part, a conglomerate. Many of the fragments of rock are\r\nwhitewashed with a thin coating of calcareous matter. At Quail Island,\r\nthe calcareous deposit is replaced in its lowest part by a soft, brown,\r\nearthy tuff, full of Turritellae; this is covered by a bed of pebbles,\r\npassing into sandstone, and mixed with fragments of echini, claws of\r\ncrabs, and shells; the oyster-shells still adhering to the rock on\r\nwhich they grew. Numerous white balls appearing like pisolitic\r\nconcretions, from the size of a walnut to that of an apple, are\r\nembedded in this deposit; they usually have a small pebble in their\r\ncentres. Although so like concretions, a close examination convinced me\r\nthat they were Nulliporae, retaining their proper forms, but with their\r\nsurfaces slightly abraded: these bodies (plants as they are now\r\ngenerally considered to be) exhibit under a microscope of ordinary\r\npower, no traces of organisation in their internal structure. Mr.\r\nGeorge R. Sowerby has been so good as to examine the shells which I\r\ncollected: there are fourteen species in a sufficiently perfect\r\ncondition for their characters to be made out with some degree of\r\ncertainty, and four which can be referred only to their genera. Of the\r\nfourteen shells, of which a list is given in the Appendix, eleven are\r\nrecent species; one, though undescribed, is perhaps identical with a\r\nspecies which I found living in the harbour of Porto Praya; the two\r\nremaining species are unknown, and have been described by Mr. Sowerby.\r\nUntil the shells of this Archipelago and of the neighbouring coasts are\r\nbetter known, it would be rash to assert that even these two latter\r\nshells are extinct. The number of species which certainly belong to\r\nexisting kinds, although few in number, are sufficient to show that the\r\ndeposit belongs to a late tertiary period. From its mineralogical\r\ncharacter, from the number and size of the embedded fragments, and from\r\nthe abundance of Patellae, and other littoral shells, it is evident\r\nthat the whole was accumulated in a shallow sea, near an ancient\r\ncoast-line.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE FLOWING OF THE SUPERINCUMBENT BASALTIC LAVA\r\nOVER THE CALCAREOUS DEPOSIT.\r\n\r\nThese effects are very curious. The calcareous matter is altered to the\r\ndepth of about a foot beneath the line of junction; and a most perfect\r\ngradation can be traced, from loosely aggregated, small, particles of\r\nshells, corallines, and Nulliporae, into a rock, in which not a trace\r\nof mechanical origin can be discovered, even with a microscope. Where\r\nthe metamorphic change has been greatest, two varieties occur. The\r\nfirst is a hard, compact, white, fine-grained rock, striped with a few\r\nparallel lines of black volcanic particles, and resembling a sandstone,\r\nbut which, upon close examination, is seen to be crystallised\r\nthroughout, with the cleavages so perfect that they can be readily\r\nmeasured by the reflecting goniometer. In specimens, where the change\r\nhas been less complete, when moistened and examined under a strong\r\nlens, the most interesting gradation can be traced, some of the rounded\r\nparticles retaining their proper forms, and others insensibly melting\r\ninto the granulo-crystalline paste. The weathered surface of this\r\nstone, as is so frequently the case with ordinary limestones, assumes a\r\nbrick-red colour.\r\n\r\nThe second metamorphosed variety is likewise a hard rock, but without\r\nany crystalline structure. It consists of a white, opaque, compact,\r\ncalcareous stone, thickly mottled with rounded, though regular, spots\r\nof a soft, earthy, ochraceous substance. This earthy matter is of a\r\npale yellowish- brown colour, and appears to be a mixture of carbonate\r\nof lime with iron; it effervesces with acids, is infusible, but\r\nblackens under the blowpipe, and becomes magnetic. The rounded form of\r\nthe minute patches of earthy substance, and the steps in the progress\r\nof their perfect formation, which can be followed in a suit of\r\nspecimens, clearly show that they are due either to some power of\r\naggregation in the earthy particles amongst themselves, or more\r\nprobably to a strong attraction between the atoms of the carbonate of\r\nline, and consequently to the segregation of the earthy extraneous\r\nmatter. I was much interested by this fact, because I have often seen\r\nquartz rocks (for instance, in the Falkland Islands, and in the lower\r\nSilurian strata of the Stiper-stones in Shropshire), mottled in a\r\nprecisely analogous manner, with little spots of a white, earthy\r\nsubstance (earthy feldspar?); and these rocks, there was good reason to\r\nsuppose, had undergone the action of heat,—a view which thus receives\r\nconfirmation. This spotted structure may possibly afford some\r\nindication in distinguishing those formations of quartz, which owe\r\ntheir present structure to igneous action, from those produced by the\r\nagency of water alone; a source of doubt, which I should think from my\r\nown experience, that most geologists, when examining arenaceo-quartzose\r\ndistricts must have experienced.\r\n\r\nThe lowest and most scoriaceous part of the lava, in rolling over the\r\nsedimentary deposit at the bottom of the sea, has caught up large\r\nquantities of calcareous matter, which now forms a snow-white, highly\r\ncrystalline basis to a breccia, including small pieces of black, glossy\r\nscoriae. A little above this, where the lime is less abundant, and the\r\nlava more compact, numerous little balls, composed of spicula of\r\ncalcareous spar, radiating from common centres, occupy the interstices.\r\nIn one part of Quail Island, the lime has thus been crystallised by the\r\nheat of the superincumbent lava, where it is only thirteen feet in\r\nthickness; nor had the lava been originally thicker, and since reduced\r\nby degradation, as could be told from the degree of cellularity of its\r\nsurface. I have already observed that the sea must have been shallow in\r\nwhich the calcareous deposit was accumulated. In this case, therefore,\r\nthe carbonic acid gas has been retained under a pressure, insignificant\r\ncompared with that (a column of water, 1,708 feet in height) originally\r\nsupposed by Sir James Hall to be requisite for this end: but since his\r\nexperiments, it has been discovered that pressure has less to do with\r\nthe retention of carbonic acid gas, than the nature of the circumjacent\r\natmosphere; and hence, as is stated to be the case by Mr. Faraday,\r\nmasses of limestone are sometimes fused and crystallised even in common\r\nlimekilns. (I am much indebted to Mr. E.W. Brayley in having given me\r\nthe following references to papers on this subject: Faraday in the\r\n“Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” volume 15 page 398; Gay-Lussac in\r\n“Annales de Chem. et Phys.” tome 63 page 219 translated in the “London\r\nand Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine” volume 10 page 496.) Carbonate of\r\nlime can be heated to almost any degree, according to Faraday, in an\r\natmosphere of carbonic acid gas, without being decomposed; and\r\nGay-Lussac found that fragments of limestone, placed in a tube and\r\nheated to a degree, not sufficient by itself to cause their\r\ndecomposition, yet immediately evolved their carbonic acid, when a\r\nstream of common air or steam was passed over them: Gay-Lussac\r\nattributes this to the mechanical displacement of the nascent carbonic\r\nacid gas. The calcareous matter beneath the lava, and especially that\r\nforming the crystalline spicula between the interstices of the scoriae,\r\nalthough heated in an atmosphere probably composed chiefly of steam,\r\ncould not have been subjected to the effects of a passing stream; and\r\nhence it is, perhaps, that they have retained their carbonic acid,\r\nunder a small amount of pressure.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of scoriae, embedded in the crystalline calcareous basis,\r\nare of a jet black colour, with a glossy fracture like pitchstone.\r\nTheir surfaces, however, are coated with a layer of a reddish-orange,\r\ntranslucent substance, which can easily be scratched with a knife;\r\nhence they appear as if overlaid by a thin layer of rosin. Some of the\r\nsmaller fragments are partially changed throughout into this substance:\r\na change which appears quite different from ordinary decomposition. At\r\nthe Galapagos Archipelago (as will be described in a future chapter),\r\ngreat beds are formed of volcanic ashes and particles of scoriae, which\r\nhave undergone a closely similar change.\r\n\r\nTHE EXTENT AND HORIZONTALITY OF THE CALCAREOUS STRATUM.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 2: SIGNAL POST HILL. (Section with A low and C high.)\r\n\r\nA.—Ancient volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nB.—Calcareous stratum.\r\n\r\nC.—Upper basaltic lava.)\r\n\r\nThe upper line of surface of the calcareous stratum, which is so\r\nconspicuous from being quite white and so nearly horizontal, ranges for\r\nmiles along the coast, at the height of about sixty feet above the sea.\r\nThe sheet of basalt, by which it is capped, is on an average eighty\r\nfeet in thickness. Westward of Porto Praya beyond Red Hill, the white\r\nstratum with the superincumbent basalt is covered up by more recent\r\nstreams. Northward of Signal Post Hill, I could follow it with my eye,\r\ntrending away for several miles along the sea cliffs. The distance thus\r\nobserved is about seven miles; but I cannot doubt from its regularity\r\nthat it extends much farther. In some ravines at right angles to the\r\ncoast, it is seen gently dipping towards the sea, probably with the\r\nsame inclination as when deposited round the ancient shores of the\r\nisland. I found only one inland section, namely, at the base of the\r\nhill marked A, where, at the height of some hundred feet, this bed was\r\nexposed; it here rested on the usual compact augitic rock associated\r\nwith wacke, and was covered by the widespread sheet of modern basaltic\r\nlava. Some exceptions occur to the horizontality of the white stratum:\r\nat Quail Island, its upper surface is only forty feet above the level\r\nof the sea; here also the capping of lava is only between twelve and\r\nfifteen feet in thickness; on the other hand, at the north-east side of\r\nPorto Praya harbour, the calcareous stratum, as well as the rock on\r\nwhich it rests, attain a height above the average level: the inequality\r\nof level in these two cases is not, as I believe, owing to unequal\r\nelevation, but to original irregularities at the bottom of the sea. Of\r\nthis fact, at Quail Island, there was clear evidence in the calcareous\r\ndeposit being in one part of much greater than the average thickness,\r\nand in another part being entirely absent; in this latter case, the\r\nmodern basaltic lavas rested directly on those of more ancient origin.\r\n\r\nUnder Signal Post Hill, the white stratum dips into the sea in a\r\nremarkable manner. This hill is conical, 450 feet in height, and\r\nretains some traces of having had a crateriform structure; it is\r\ncomposed chiefly of matter erupted posteriorly to the elevation of the\r\ngreat basaltic plain, but partly of lava of apparently submarine origin\r\nand of considerable antiquity. The surrounding plain, as well as the\r\neastern flank of this hill, has been worn into steep precipices,\r\noverhanging the sea. In these precipices, the white calcareous stratum\r\nmay be seen, at the height of about seventy feet above the beach,\r\nrunning for some miles both northward and southward of the hill, in a\r\nline appearing to be perfectly horizontal; but for a space of a quarter\r\nof a mile directly under the hill, it dips into the sea and disappears.\r\nOn the south side the dip is gradual, on the north side it is more\r\nabrupt, as is shown in Figure 2. As neither the calcareous stratum, nor\r\nthe superincumbent basaltic lava (as far as the latter can be\r\ndistinguished from the more modern ejections), appears to thicken as it\r\ndips, I infer that these strata were not originally accumulated in a\r\ntrough, the centre of which afterwards became a point of eruption; but\r\nthat they have subsequently been disturbed and bent. We may suppose\r\neither that Signal Post Hill subsided after its elevation with the\r\nsurrounding country, or that it never was uplifted to the same height\r\nwith it. This latter seems to me the most probable alternative, for\r\nduring the slow and equable elevation of this portion of the island,\r\nthe subterranean motive power, from expending part of its force in\r\nrepeatedly erupting volcanic matter from beneath this point, would, it\r\nis likely, have less force to uplift it. Something of the same kind\r\nseems to have occurred near Red Hill, for when tracing upwards the\r\nnaked streams of lava from near Porto Praya towards the interior of the\r\nisland, I was strongly induced to suspect, that since the lava had\r\nflowed, the slope of the land had been slightly modified, either by a\r\nsmall subsidence near Red Hill, or by that portion of the plain having\r\nbeen uplifted to a less height during the elevation of the whole area.\r\n\r\nTHE BASALTIC LAVA, SUPERINCUMBENT ON THE CALCAREOUS DEPOSIT.\r\n\r\nThis lava is of a pale grey colour, fusing into a black enamel; its\r\nfracture is rather earthy and concretionary; it contains olivine in\r\nsmall grains. The central parts of the mass are compact, or at most\r\ncrenulated with a few minute cavities, and are often columnar. At Quail\r\nIsland this structure was assumed in a striking manner; the lava in one\r\npart being divided into horizontal laminae, which became in another\r\npart split by vertical fissures into five-sided plates; and these\r\nagain, being piled on each other, insensibly became soldered together,\r\nforming fine symmetrical columns. The lower surface of the lava is\r\nvesicular, but sometimes only to the thickness of a few inches; the\r\nupper surface, which is likewise vesicular, is divided into balls,\r\nfrequently as much as three feet in diameter, made up of concentric\r\nlayers. The mass is composed of more than one stream; its total\r\nthickness being, on an average, about eighty feet: the lower portion\r\nhas certainly flowed beneath the sea, and probably likewise the upper\r\nportion. The chief part of this lava has flowed from the central\r\ndistricts, between the hills marked A, B, C, etc., in the woodcut- map.\r\nThe surface of the country, near the coast, is level and barren;\r\ntowards the interior, the land rises by successive terraces, of which\r\nfour, when viewed from a distance, could be distinctly counted.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC ERUPTIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ELEVATION OF THE COASTLAND; THE\r\nEJECTED MATTER ASSOCIATED WITH EARTHY LIME.\r\n\r\nThese recent lavas have proceeded from those scattered, conical,\r\nreddish- coloured hills, which rise abruptly from the plain-country\r\nnear the coast. I ascended some of them, but will describe only one,\r\nnamely, RED HILL, which may serve as a type of its class, and is\r\nremarkable in some especial respects. Its height is about six hundred\r\nfeet; it is composed of bright red, highly scoriaceous rock of a\r\nbasaltic nature; on one side of its summit there is a hollow, probably\r\nthe last remnant of a crater. Several of the other hills of this class,\r\njudging from their external forms, are surmounted by much more perfect\r\ncraters. When sailing along the coast, it was evident that a\r\nconsiderable body of lava had flowed from Red Hill, over a line of\r\ncliff about one hundred and twenty feet in height, into the sea: this\r\nline of cliff is continuous with that forming the coast, and bounding\r\nthe plain on both sides of this hill; these streams, therefore, were\r\nerupted, after the formation of the coast-cliffs, from Red Hill, when\r\nit must have stood, as it now does, above the level of the sea. This\r\nconclusion accords with the highly scoriaceous condition of all the\r\nrock on it, appearing to be of subaerial formation: and this is\r\nimportant, as there are some beds of calcareous matter near its summit,\r\nwhich might, at a hasty glance, have been mistaken for a submarine\r\ndeposit. These beds consist of white, earthy, carbonate of lime,\r\nextremely friable so as to be crushed with the least pressure; the most\r\ncompact specimens not resisting the strength of the fingers. Some of\r\nthe masses are as white as quicklime, and appear absolutely pure; but\r\non examining them with a lens, minute particles of scoriae can always\r\nbe seen, and I could find none which, when dissolved in acids, did not\r\nleave a residue of this nature. It is, moreover, difficult to find a\r\nparticle of the lime which does not change colour under the blowpipe,\r\nmost of them even becoming glazed. The scoriaceous fragments and the\r\ncalcareous matter are associated in the most irregular manner,\r\nsometimes in obscure beds, but more generally as a confused breccia,\r\nthe lime in some parts and the scoriae in others being most abundant.\r\nSir H. De la Beche has been so kind as to have some of the purest\r\nspecimens analysed, with a view to discover, considering their volcanic\r\norigin, whether they contained much magnesia; but only a small portion\r\nwas found, such as is present in most limestones.\r\n\r\nFragments of the scoriae embedded in the calcareous mass, when broken,\r\nexhibit many of their cells lined and partly filled with a white,\r\ndelicate, excessively fragile, moss-like, or rather conferva-like,\r\nreticulation of carbonate of lime. These fibres, examined under a lens\r\nof one-tenth of an inch focal distance, appear cylindrical; they are\r\nrather above one- thousandth of an inch in diameter; they are either\r\nsimply branched, or more commonly united into an irregular mass of\r\nnetwork, with the meshes of very unequal sizes and of unequal numbers\r\nof sides. Some of the fibres are thickly covered with extremely minute\r\nspicula, occasionally aggregated into little tuffs; and hence they have\r\na hairy appearance. These spicula are of the same diameter throughout\r\ntheir length; they are easily detached, so that the object-glass of the\r\nmicroscope soon becomes scattered over with them. Within the cells of\r\nmany fragments of the scoria, the lime exhibits this fibrous structure,\r\nbut generally in a less perfect degree. These cells do not appear to be\r\nconnected with one another. There can be no doubt, as will presently be\r\nshown, that the lime was erupted, mingled with the lava in its fluid\r\nstate, and therefore I have thought it worth while to describe minutely\r\nthis curious fibrous structure, of which I know nothing analogous. From\r\nthe earthy condition of the fibres, this structure does not appear to\r\nbe related to crystallisation.\r\n\r\nOther fragments of the scoriaceous rock from this hill, when broken,\r\nare often seen marked with short and irregular white streaks, which are\r\nowing to a row of separate cells being partly, or quite, filled with\r\nwhite calcareous powder. This structure immediately reminded me of the\r\nappearance in badly kneaded dough, of balls and drawn-out streaks of\r\nflour, which have remained unmixed with the paste; and I cannot doubt\r\nthat small masses of the lime, in the same manner remaining unmixed\r\nwith the fluid lava, have been drawn out when the whole was in motion.\r\nI carefully examined, by trituration and solution in acids, pieces of\r\nthe scoriae, taken from within half-an-inch of those cells which were\r\nfilled with the calcareous powder, and they did not contain an atom of\r\nfree lime. It is obvious that the lava and lime have on a large scale\r\nbeen very imperfectly mingled; and where small portions of the lime\r\nhave been entangled within a piece of the viscid lava, the cause of\r\ntheir now occupying, in the form of a powder or of a fibrous\r\nreticulation, the vesicular cavities, is, I think, evidently due to the\r\nconfined gases having most readily expanded at the points where the\r\nincoherent lime rendered the lava less adhesive.\r\n\r\nA mile eastward of the town of Praya, there is a steep-sided gorge,\r\nabout one hundred and fifty yards in width, cutting through the\r\nbasaltic plain and underlying beds, but since filled up by a stream of\r\nmore modern lava. This lava is dark grey, and in most parts compact and\r\nrudely columnar; but at a little distance from the coast, it includes\r\nin an irregular manner a brecciated mass of red scoriae mingled with a\r\nconsiderable quantity of white, friable, and in some parts, nearly pure\r\nearthy lime, like that on the summit of Red Hill. This lava, with its\r\nentangled lime, has certainly flowed in the form of a regular stream;\r\nand, judging from the shape of the gorge, towards which the drainage of\r\nthe country (feeble though it now be) still is directed, and from the\r\nappearance of the bed of loose water-worn blocks with their interstices\r\nunfilled, like those in the bed of a torrent, on which the lava rests,\r\nwe may conclude that the stream was of subaerial origin. I was unable\r\nto trace it to its source, but, from its direction, it seemed to have\r\ncome from Signal Post Hill, distant one mile and a quarter, which, like\r\nRed Hill, has been a point of eruption subsequent to the elevation of\r\nthe great basaltic plain. It accords with this view, that I found on\r\nSignal Post Hill, a mass of earthy, calcareous matter of the same\r\nnature, mingled with scoriae. I may here observe that part of the\r\ncalcareous matter forming the horizontal sedimentary bed, especially\r\nthe finer matter with which the embedded fragments of rock are\r\nwhitewashed, has probably been derived from similar volcanic eruptions,\r\nas well as from triturated organic remains: the underlying, ancient,\r\ncrystalline rocks, also, are associated with much carbonate of lime,\r\nfilling amygdaloidal cavities, and forming irregular masses, the nature\r\nof which latter I was unable to understand.\r\n\r\nConsidering the abundance of earthy lime near the summit of Red Hill, a\r\nvolcanic cone six hundred feet in height, of subaerial\r\ngrowth,—considering the intimate manner in which minute particles and\r\nlarge masses of scoriae are embedded in the masses of nearly pure lime,\r\nand on the other hand, the manner in which small kernels and streaks of\r\nthe calcareous powder are included in solid pieces of the\r\nscoriae,—considering, also, the similar occurrence of lime and scoriae\r\nwithin a stream of lava, also supposed, with good reason, to have been\r\nof modern subaerial origin, and to have flowed from a hill, where\r\nearthy lime also occurs: I think, considering these facts, there can be\r\nno doubt that the lime has been erupted, mingled with the molten lava.\r\nI am not aware that any similar case has been described: it appears to\r\nme an interesting one, inasmuch as most geologists must have speculated\r\non the probable effects of a volcanic focus, bursting through\r\ndeep-seated beds of different mineralogical composition. The great\r\nabundance of free silex in the trachytes of some countries (as\r\ndescribed by Beudant in Hungary, and by P. Scrope in the Panza\r\nIslands), perhaps solves the inquiry with respect to deep-seated beds\r\nof quartz; and we probably here see it answered, where the volcanic\r\naction has invaded subjacent masses of limestone. One is naturally led\r\nto conjecture in what state the now earthy carbonate of lime existed,\r\nwhen ejected with the intensely heated lava: from the extreme\r\ncellularity of the scoriae on Red Hill, the pressure cannot have been\r\ngreat, and as most volcanic eruptions are accompanied by the emission\r\nof large quantities of steam and other gases, we here have the most\r\nfavourable conditions, according to the views at present entertained by\r\nchemists, for the expulsion of the carbonic acid. (Whilst deep beneath\r\nthe surface, the carbonate of lime was, I presume, in a fluid state.\r\nHutton, it is known, thought that all amygdaloids were produced by\r\ndrops of molten limestone floating in the trap, like oil in water: this\r\nno doubt is erroneous, but if the matter forming the summit of Red Hill\r\nhad been cooled under the pressure of a moderately deep sea, or within\r\nthe walls of a dike, we should, in all probability, have had a trap\r\nrock associated with large masses of compact, crystalline, calcareous\r\nspar, which, according to the views entertained by many geologists,\r\nwould have been wrongly attributed to subsequent infiltration.) Has the\r\nslow re- absorption of this gas, it may be asked, given to the lime in\r\nthe cells of the lava, that peculiar fibrous structure, like that of an\r\nefflorescing salt? Finally, I may remark on the great contrast in\r\nappearance between this earthy lime, which must have been heated in a\r\nfree atmosphere of steam and other gases, while the white, crystalline,\r\ncalcareous spar, produced by a single thin sheet of lava (as at Quail\r\nIsland) rolling over similar earthy lime and the debris of organic\r\nremains, at the bottom of a shallow sea.\r\n\r\nSIGNAL POST HILL.\r\n\r\nThis hill has already been several times mentioned, especially with\r\nreference to the remarkable manner in which the white calcareous\r\nstratum, in other parts so horizontal (Figure 2), dips under it into\r\nthe sea. It has a broad summit, with obscure traces of a crateriform\r\nstructure, and is composed of basaltic rocks (Of these, one common\r\nvariety is remarkable for being full of small fragments of a dark\r\njasper-red earthy mineral, which, when examined carefully, shows an\r\nindistinct cleavage; the little fragments are elongated in form, are\r\nsoft, are magnetic before and after being heated, and fuse with\r\ndifficulty into a dull enamel. This mineral is evidently closely\r\nrelated to the oxides of iron, but I cannot ascertain what it exactly\r\nis. The rock containing this mineral is crenulated with small angular\r\ncavities, which are lined and filled with yellowish crystals of\r\ncarbonate of lime.), some compact, others highly cellular with inclined\r\nbeds of loose scoriae, of which some are associated with earthy lime.\r\nLike Red Hill, it has been the source of eruptions, subsequently to the\r\nelevation of the surrounding basaltic plain; but unlike that hill, it\r\nhas undergone considerable denudation, and has been the seat of\r\nvolcanic action at a remote period, when beneath the sea. I judge of\r\nthis latter circumstance from finding on its inland flank the last\r\nremains of three small points of eruption. These points are composed of\r\nglossy scoriae, cemented by crystalline calcareous spar, exactly like\r\nthe great submarine calcareous deposit, where the heated lava has\r\nrolled over it: their demolished state can, I think, be explained only\r\nby the denuding action of the waves of the sea. I was guided to the\r\nfirst orifice by observing a sheet of lava, about two hundred yards\r\nsquare, with steepish sides, superimposed on the basaltic plain with no\r\nadjoining hillock, whence it could have been erupted; and the only\r\ntrace of a crater which I was able to discover, consisted of some\r\ninclined beds of scoriae at one of its corners. At the distance of\r\nfifty yards from a second level-topped patch of lava, but of much\r\nsmaller size, I found an irregular circular group of masses of\r\ncemented, scoriaceous breccia, about six feet in height, which\r\ndoubtless had once formed the point of eruption. The third orifice is\r\nnow marked only by an irregular circle of cemented scoriae, about four\r\nyards in diameter, and rising in its highest point scarcely three feet\r\nabove the level of the plain, the surface of which, close all round,\r\nexhibits its usual appearance: here we have a horizontal basal section\r\nof a volcanic spiracle, which, together with all its ejected matter,\r\nhas been almost totally obliterated.\r\n\r\nThe stream of lava, which fills the narrow gorge eastward of the town\r\nof Praya, judging from its course, seems, as before remarked, to have\r\ncome from Signal Post Hill, and to have flowed over the plain, after\r\nits elevation (The sides of this gorge, where the upper basaltic\r\nstratum is intersected, are almost perpendicular. The lava, which has\r\nsince filled it up, is attached to these sides, almost as firmly as a\r\ndike is to its walls. In most cases, where a stream of lava has flowed\r\ndown a valley, it is bounded on each side by loose scoriaceous\r\nmasses.): the same observation applies to a stream (possibly part of\r\nthe same one) capping the sea cliffs, a little eastward of the gorge.\r\nWhen I endeavoured to follow these streams over the stony level plain,\r\nwhich is almost destitute of soil and vegetation, I was much surprised\r\nto find, that although composed of hard basaltic matter, and not having\r\nbeen exposed to marine denudation, all distant traces of them soon\r\nbecame utterly lost. But I have since observed at the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, that it is often impossible to follow even great deluges\r\nof quite recent lava across older streams, except by the size of the\r\nbushes growing on them, or by the comparative states of glossiness of\r\ntheir surfaces,—characters which a short lapse of time would be\r\nsufficient quite to obscure. I may remark, that in a level country,\r\nwith a dry climate, and with the wind blowing always in one direction\r\n(as at the Cape de Verde Archipelago), the effects of atmospheric\r\ndegradation are probably much greater than would at first be expected;\r\nfor soil in this case accumulates only in a few protected hollows, and\r\nbeing blown in one direction, it is always travelling towards the sea\r\nin the form of the finest dust, leaving the surface of the rocks bare,\r\nand exposed to the full effects of renewed meteoric action.\r\n\r\nINLAND HILLS OF MORE ANCIENT VOLCANIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThese hills are laid down by eye, and marked as A, B, C, etc., in Map\r\n1. They are related in mineralogical composition, and are probably\r\ndirectly continuous with the lowest rocks exposed on the coast. These\r\nhills, viewed from a distance, appear as if they had once formed part\r\nof an irregular tableland, and from their corresponding structure and\r\ncomposition this probably has been the case. They have flat, slightly\r\ninclined summits, and are, on an average, about six hundred feet in\r\nheight; they present their steepest slope towards the interior of the\r\nisland, from which point they radiate outwards, and are separated from\r\neach other by broad and deep valleys, through which the great streams\r\nof lava, forming the coast-plains, have descended. Their inner and\r\nsteeper escarpments are ranged in an irregular curve, which rudely\r\nfollows the line of the shore, two or three miles inland from it. I\r\nascended a few of these hills, and from others, which I was able to\r\nexamine with a telescope, I obtained specimens, through the kindness of\r\nMr. Kent, the assistant-surgeon of the “Beagle”; although by these\r\nmeans I am acquainted with only a part of the range, five or six miles\r\nin length, yet I scarcely hesitate, from their uniform structure, to\r\naffirm that they are parts of one great formation, stretching round\r\nmuch of the circumference of the island.\r\n\r\nThe upper and lower strata of these hills differ greatly in\r\ncomposition. The upper are basaltic, generally compact, but sometimes\r\nscoriaceous and amygdaloidal, with associated masses of wacke: where\r\nthe basalt is compact, it is either fine-grained or very coarsely\r\ncrystallised; in the latter case it passes into an augitic rock,\r\ncontaining much olivine; the olivine is either colourless, or of the\r\nusual yellow and dull reddish shades. On some of the hills, beds of\r\ncalcareous matter, both in an earthy and in a crystalline form,\r\nincluding fragments of glossy scoriae, are associated with the basaltic\r\nstrata. These strata differ from the streams of basaltic lava forming\r\nthe coast-plains, only in being more compact, and in the crystals of\r\naugite, and in the grains of olivine being of much greater\r\nsize;—characters which, together with the appearance of the associated\r\ncalcareous beds, induce me to believe that they are of submarine\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nSome considerable masses of wacke, which are associated with these\r\nbasaltic strata, and which likewise occur in the basal series on the\r\ncoast, especially at Quail Island, are curious. They consist of a pale\r\nyellowish- green argillaceous substance, of a crumbling texture when\r\ndry, but unctuous when moist: in its purest form, it is of a beautiful\r\ngreen tint, with translucent edges, and occasionally with obscure\r\ntraces of an original cleavage. Under the blowpipe it fuses very\r\nreadily into a dark grey, and sometimes even black bead, which is\r\nslightly magnetic. From these characters, I naturally thought that it\r\nwas one of the pale species, decomposed, of the genus augite;—a\r\nconclusion supported by the unaltered rock being full of large separate\r\ncrystals of black augite, and of balls and irregular streaks of dark\r\ngrey augitic rock. As the basalt ordinarily consists of augite, and of\r\nolivine often tarnished and of a dull red colour, I was led to examine\r\nthe stages of decomposition of this latter mineral, and I found, to my\r\nsurprise, that I could trace a nearly perfect gradation from unaltered\r\nolivine to the green wacke. Part of the same grain under the blowpipe\r\nwould in some instances behave like olivine, its colour being only\r\nslightly changed, and part would give a black magnetic bead. Hence I\r\ncan have no doubt that the greenish wacke originally existed as\r\nolivine; but great chemical changes must have been effected during the\r\nact of decomposition thus to have altered a very hard, transparent,\r\ninfusible mineral, into a soft, unctuous, easily melted, argillaceous\r\nsubstance. (D’Aubuisson “Traite de Geognosie” tome 2 page 569 mentions,\r\non the authority of M. Marcel de Serres, masses of green earth near\r\nMontpellier, which are supposed to be due to the decomposition of\r\nolivine. I do not, however, find, that the action of this mineral under\r\nthe blowpipe being entirely altered, as it becomes decomposed, has been\r\nnoticed; and the knowledge of this fact is important, as at first it\r\nappears highly improbable that a hard, transparent, refractory mineral\r\nshould be changed into a soft, easily fused clay, like this of St.\r\nJago. I shall hereafter describe a green substance, forming threads\r\nwithin the cells of some vesicular basaltic rocks in Van Diemen’s Land,\r\nwhich behave under the blowpipe like the green wacke of St. Jago; but\r\nits occurrence in cylindrical threads, shows it cannot have resulted\r\nfrom the decomposition of olivine, a mineral always existing in the\r\nform of grains or crystals.)\r\n\r\nThe basal strata of these hills, as well as some neighbouring,\r\nseparate, bare, rounded hillocks, consist of compact, fine-grained,\r\nnon-crystalline (or so slightly as scarcely to be perceptible),\r\nferruginous, feldspathic rocks, and generally in a state of\r\nsemi-decomposition. Their fracture is exceedingly irregular, and\r\nsplintery; yet small fragments are often very tough. They contain much\r\nferruginous matter, either in the form of minute grains with a metallic\r\nlustre, or of brown hair-like threads: the rock in this latter case\r\nassuming a pseudo-brecciated structure. These rocks sometimes contain\r\nmica and veins of agate. Their rusty brown or yellowish colour is\r\npartly due to the oxides of iron, but chiefly to innumerable,\r\nmicroscopically minute, black specks, which, when a fragment is heated,\r\nare easily fused, and evidently are either hornblende or augite. These\r\nrocks, therefore, although at first appearing like baked clay or some\r\naltered sedimentary deposit, contain all the essential ingredients of\r\ntrachyte; from which they differ only in not being harsh, and in not\r\ncontaining crystals of glassy feldspar. As is so often the case with\r\ntrachytic formation, no stratification is here apparent. A person would\r\nnot readily believe that these rocks could have flowed as lava; yet at\r\nSt. Helena there are well-characterised streams (as will be described\r\nin an ensuing chapter) of nearly similar composition. Amidst the\r\nhillocks composed of these rocks, I found in three places, smooth\r\nconical hills of phonolite, abounding with fine crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar, and with needles of hornblende. These cones of phonolite, I\r\nbelieve, bear the same relation to the surrounding feldspathic strata\r\nwhich some masses of coarsely crystallised augitic rock, in another\r\npart of the island, bear to the surrounding basalt, namely, that both\r\nhave been injected. The rocks of a feldspathic nature being anterior in\r\norigin to the basaltic strata, which cap them, as well as to the\r\nbasaltic streams of the coast-plains, accords with the usual order of\r\nsuccession of these two grand divisions of the volcanic series.\r\n\r\nThe strata of most of these hills in the upper part, where alone the\r\nplanes of division are distinguishable, are inclined at a small angle\r\nfrom the interior of the island towards the sea-coast. The inclination\r\nis not the same in each hill; in that marked A it is less than in B, D,\r\nor E; in C the strata are scarcely deflected from a horizontal plane,\r\nand in F (as far as I could judge without ascending it) they are\r\nslightly inclined in a reverse direction, that is, inwards and towards\r\nthe centre of the island. Notwithstanding these differences of\r\ninclination, their correspondence in external form, and in the\r\ncomposition both of their upper and lower parts,- -their relative\r\nposition in one curved line, with their steepest sides turned\r\ninwards,—all seem to show that they originally formed parts of one\r\nplatform; which platform, as before remarked, probably extended round a\r\nconsiderable portion of the circumference of the island. The upper\r\nstrata certainly flowed as lava, and probably beneath the sea, as\r\nperhaps did the lower feldspathic masses: how then come these strata to\r\nhold their present position, and whence were they erupted?\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the island there are lofty mountains, but they are\r\nseparated from the steep inland flanks of these hills by a wide space\r\nof lower country: the interior mountains, moreover, seem to have been\r\nthe source of those great streams of basaltic lava which, contracting\r\nas they pass between the bases of the hills in question, expand into\r\nthe coast- plains. (I saw very little of the inland parts of the\r\nisland. Near the village of St. Domingo, there are magnificent cliffs\r\nof rather coarsely crystallised basaltic lava. Following the little\r\nstream in this valley, about a mile above the village, the base of the\r\ngreat cliff was formed of a compact fine-grained basalt, conformably\r\ncovered by a bed of pebbles. Near Fuentes, I met with pap-formed hills\r\nof the compact feldspathic series of rocks.) Round the shores of St.\r\nHelena there is a rudely formed ring of basaltic rocks, and at\r\nMauritius there are remnants of another such a ring round part, if not\r\nround the whole, of the island; here again the same question\r\nimmediately occurs, how came these masses to hold their present\r\nposition, and whence were they erupted? The same answer, whatever it\r\nmay be, probably applies in these three cases; and in a future chapter\r\nwe shall recur to this subject.\r\n\r\nVALLEYS NEAR THE COAST.\r\n\r\nThese are broad, very flat, and generally bounded by low cliff-formed\r\nsides. Portions of the basaltic plain are sometimes nearly or quite\r\nisolated by them; of which fact, the space on which the town of Praya\r\nstands offers an instance. The great valley west of the town has its\r\nbottom filled up to a depth of more than twenty feet by well-rounded\r\npebbles, which in some parts are firmly cemented together by white\r\ncalcareous matter. There can be no doubt, from the form of these\r\nvalleys, that they were scooped out by the waves of the sea, during\r\nthat equable elevation of the land, of which the horizontal calcareous\r\ndeposit, with its existing species of marine remains, gives evidence.\r\nConsidering how well shells have been preserved in this stratum, it is\r\nsingular that I could not find even a single small fragment of shell in\r\nthe conglomerate at the bottom of the valleys. The bed of pebbles in\r\nthe valley west of the town is intersected by a second valley joining\r\nit as a tributary, but even this valley appears much too wide and\r\nflat-bottomed to have been formed by the small quantity of water, which\r\nfalls only during one short wet season; for at other times of the year\r\nthese valleys are absolutely dry.\r\n\r\nRECENT CONGLOMERATE.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of Quail Island, I found fragments of brick, bolts of\r\niron, pebbles, and large fragments of basalt, united by a scanty base\r\nof impure calcareous matter into a firm conglomerate. To show how\r\nexceedingly firm this recent conglomerate is, I may mention, that I\r\nendeavoured with a heavy geological hammer to knock out a thick bolt of\r\niron, which was embedded a little above low-water mark, but was quite\r\nunable to succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nFERNANDO NORONHA; TERCEIRA; TAHITI, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERNANDO NORONHA. Precipitous hill of phonolite.\r\n\r\nTERCEIRA. Trachytic rocks: their singular decomposition by steam of\r\nhigh temperature.\r\n\r\nTAHITI. Passage from wacke into trap; singular volcanic rock with the\r\nvesicles half-filled with mesotype.\r\n\r\nMAURITIUS. Proofs of its recent elevation. Structure of its more\r\nancient mountains; similarity with St. Jago.\r\n\r\nST. PAUL’S ROCKS. Not of volcanic origin. Their singular mineralogical\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nFERNANDO NORONHA.\r\n\r\nDuring our short visit at this and the four following islands, I\r\nobserved very little worthy of description. Fernando Noronha is\r\nsituated in the Atlantic Ocean, in latitude 3 degrees 50 minutes S.,\r\nand 230 miles distant from the coast of South America. It consists of\r\nseveral islets, together nine miles in length by three in breadth. The\r\nwhole seems to be of volcanic origin; although there is no appearance\r\nof any crater, or of any one central eminence. The most remarkable\r\nfeature is a hill 1,000 feet high, of which the upper 400 feet consist\r\nof a precipitous, singularly shaped pinnacle, formed of columnar\r\nphonolite, containing numerous crystals of glassy feldspar, and a few\r\nneedles of hornblende. From the highest accessible point of this hill,\r\nI could distinguish in different parts of the group several other\r\nconical hills, apparently of the same nature. At St. Helena there are\r\nsimilar, great, conical, protuberant masses of phonolite, nearly one\r\nthousand feet in height, which have been formed by the injection of\r\nfluid feldspathic lava into yielding strata. If this hill has had, as\r\nis probable, a similar origin, denudation has been here effected on an\r\nenormous scale. Near the base of this hill, I observed beds of white\r\ntuff, intersected by numerous dikes, some of amygdaloidal basalt and\r\nothers of trachyte; and beds of slaty phonolite with the planes of\r\ncleavage directed N.W. and S.E. Parts of this rock, where the crystals\r\nwere scanty, closely resembled common clay-slate, altered by the\r\ncontact of a trap-dike. The lamination of rocks, which undoubtedly have\r\nonce been fluid, appears to me a subject well deserving attention. On\r\nthe beach there were numerous fragments of compact basalt, of which\r\nrock a distant facade of columns seemed to be formed.\r\n\r\nTERCEIRA IN THE AZORES.\r\n\r\nThe central parts of this island consist of irregularly rounded\r\nmountains of no great elevation, composed of trachyte, which closely\r\nresembles in general character the trachyte of Ascension, presently to\r\nbe described. This formation is in many parts overlaid, in the usual\r\norder of superposition, by streams of basaltic lava, which near the\r\ncoast compose nearly the whole surface. The course which these streams\r\nhave followed from their craters, can often be followed by the eye. The\r\ntown of Angra is overlooked by a crateriform hill (Mount Brazil),\r\nentirely built of thin strata of fine-grained, harsh, brown-coloured\r\ntuff. The upper beds are seen to overlap the basaltic streams on which\r\nthe town stands. This hill is almost identical in structure and\r\ncomposition with numerous crateriformed hills in the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF STEAM ON THE TRACHYTIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\nIn the central part of the island there is a spot, where steam is\r\nconstantly issuing in jets from the bottom of a small ravine-like\r\nhollow, which has no exit, and which abuts against a range of trachytic\r\nmountains. The steam is emitted from several irregular fissures: it is\r\nscentless, soon blackens iron, and is of much too high temperature to\r\nbe endured by the hand. The manner in which the solid trachyte is\r\nchanged on the borders of these orifices is curious: first, the base\r\nbecomes earthy, with red freckles evidently due to the oxidation of\r\nparticles of iron; then it becomes soft; and lastly, even the crystals\r\nof glassy feldspar yield to the dissolving agent. After the mass is\r\nconverted into clay, the oxide of iron seems to be entirely removed\r\nfrom some parts, which are left perfectly white, whilst in other\r\nneighbouring parts, which are of the brightest red colour, it seems to\r\nbe deposited in greater quantity; some other masses are marbled with\r\ntwo distinct colours. Portions of the white clay, now that they are\r\ndry, cannot be distinguished by the eye from the finest prepared chalk;\r\nand when placed between the teeth they feel equally soft-grained; the\r\ninhabitants use this substance for white-washing their houses. The\r\ncause of the iron being dissolved in one part, and close by being again\r\ndeposited, is obscure; but the fact has been observed in several other\r\nplaces. (Spallanzani, Dolomieu, and Hoffman have described similar\r\ncases in the Italian volcanic islands. Dolomieu says the iron at the\r\nPanza Islands is redeposited in the form of veins (page 86 “Memoire sur\r\nles Isles Ponces”). These authors likewise believe that the steam\r\ndeposits silica: it is now experimentally known that vapour of a high\r\ntemperature is able to dissolve silica.) In some half-decayed\r\nspecimens, I found small, globular aggregations of yellow hyalite,\r\nresembling gum-arabic, which no doubt had been deposited by the steam.\r\n\r\nAs there is no escape for the rain-water, which trickles down the sides\r\nof the ravine-like hollow, whence the steam issues, it must all\r\npercolate downwards through the fissures at its bottom. Some of the\r\ninhabitants informed me that it was on record that flames (some\r\nluminous appearance?) had originally proceeded from these cracks, and\r\nthat the flames had been succeeded by the steam; but I was not able to\r\nascertain how long this was ago, or anything certain on the subject.\r\nWhen viewing the spot, I imagined that the injection of a large mass of\r\nrock. like the cone of phonolite at Fernando Noronha, in a semi-fluid\r\nstate, by arching the surface might have caused a wedge-shaped hollow\r\nwith cracks at the bottom, and that the rain- water percolating to the\r\nneighbourhood of the heated mass, would during many succeeding years be\r\ndriven back in the form of steam.\r\n\r\nTAHITI (OTAHEITE).\r\n\r\nI visited only a part of the north-western side of this island, and\r\nthis part is entirely composed of volcanic rocks. Near the coast there\r\nare several varieties of basalt, some abounding with large crystals of\r\naugite and tarnished olivine, others compact and earthy,—some slightly\r\nvesicular, and others occasionally amygdaloidal. These rocks are\r\ngenerally much decomposed, and to my surprise, I found in several\r\nsections that it was impossible to distinguish, even approximately, the\r\nline of separation between the decayed lava and the alternating beds of\r\ntuff. Since the specimens have become dry, it is rather more easy to\r\ndistinguish the decomposed igneous rocks from the sedimentary tuffs.\r\nThis gradation in character between rocks having such widely different\r\norigins, may I think be explained by the yielding under pressure of the\r\nsoftened sides of the vesicular cavities, which in many volcanic rocks\r\noccupy a large proportion of their bulk. As the vesicles generally\r\nincrease in size and number in the upper parts of a stream of lava, so\r\nwould the effects of their compression increase; the yielding,\r\nmoreover, of each lower vesicle must tend to disturb all the softened\r\nmatter above it. Hence we might expect to trace a perfect gradation\r\nfrom an unaltered crystalline rock to one in which all the particles\r\n(although originally forming part of the same solid mass) had undergone\r\nmechanical displacement; and such particles could hardly be\r\ndistinguished from others of similar composition, which had been\r\ndeposited as sediment. As lavas are sometimes laminated in their upper\r\nparts even horizontal lines, appearing like those of aqueous\r\ndeposition, could not in all cases be relied on as a criterion of\r\nsedimentary origin. From these considerations it is not surprising that\r\nformerly many geologists believed in real transitions from aqueous\r\ndeposits, through wacke, into igneous traps.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of Tia-auru, the commonest rocks are basalts with much\r\nolivine, and in some cases almost composed of large crystals of augite.\r\nI picked up some specimens, with much glassy feldspar, approaching in\r\ncharacter to trachyte. There were also many large blocks of vesicular\r\nbasalt, with the cavities beautifully lined with chabasie (?), and\r\nradiating bundles of mesotype. Some of these specimens presented a\r\ncurious appearance, owing to a number of the vesicles being half filled\r\nup with a white, soft, earthy mesotypic mineral, which intumesced under\r\nthe blowpipe in a remarkable manner. As the upper surfaces in all the\r\nhalf-filled cells are exactly parallel, it is evident that this\r\nsubstance has sunk to the bottom of each cell from its weight.\r\nSometimes, however, it entirely fills the cells. Other cells are either\r\nquite filled, or lined, with small crystals, apparently of chabasie;\r\nthese crystals, also, frequently line the upper half of the cells\r\npartly filled with the earthy mineral, as well as the upper surface of\r\nthis substance itself, in which case the two minerals appear to blend\r\ninto each other. I have never seen any other amygdaloid with the cells\r\nhalf filled in the manner here described; and it is difficult to\r\nimagine the causes which determined the earthy mineral to sink from its\r\ngravity to the bottom of the cells, and the crystalline mineral to\r\nadhere in a coating of equal thickness round the sides of the cells.\r\n(MacCulloch, however, has described and given a plate of (“Geolog.\r\nTrans.” 1st series volume 4 page 225) a trap rock, with cavities filled\r\nup horizontally with quartz and chalcedony. The upper halves of these\r\ncavities are often filled by layers, which follow each irregularity of\r\nthe surface, and by little depending stalactites of the same siliceous\r\nsubstances.)\r\n\r\nThe basic strata on the sides of the valley are gently inclined\r\nseaward, and I nowhere observed any sign of disturbance; the strata are\r\nseparated from each other by thick, compact beds of conglomerate, in\r\nwhich the fragments are large, some being rounded, but most angular.\r\nFrom the character of these beds, from the compact and crystalline\r\ncondition of most of the lavas, and from the nature of the infiltrated\r\nminerals, I was led to conjecture that they had originally flowed\r\nbeneath the sea. This conclusion agrees with the fact that the Rev. W.\r\nEllis found marine remains at a considerable height, which he believes\r\nwere interstratified with volcanic matter; as is likewise described to\r\nbe the case by Messrs. Tyerman and Bennett at Huaheine, an island in\r\nthis same archipelago. Mr. Stutchbury also discovered near the summit\r\nof one of the loftiest mountains of Tahiti, at the height of several\r\nthousand feet, a stratum of semi-fossil coral. None of these remains\r\nhave been specifically examined. On the coast, where masses of\r\ncoral-rock would have afforded the clearest evidence, I looked in vain\r\nfor any signs of recent elevation. For references to the above\r\nauthorities, and for more detailed reasons for not believing that\r\nTahiti has been recently elevated, I must refer to the “Structure and\r\nDistribution of Coral-Reefs.”\r\n\r\nMAURITIUS.\r\n\r\nApproaching this island on the northern or north-western side, a curved\r\nchain of bold mountains, surmounted by rugged pinnacles, is seen to\r\nrise from a smooth border of cultivated land, which gently slopes down\r\nto the coast. At the first glance, one is tempted to believe that the\r\nsea lately reached the base of these mountains, and upon examination,\r\nthis view, at least with respect to the inferior parts of the border,\r\nis found to be perfectly correct. Several authors have described masses\r\nof upraised coral- rock round the greater part of the circumference of\r\nthe island. (Captain Carmichael, in Hooker’s “Bot. Misc.” volume 2 page\r\n301. Captain Lloyd has lately, in the “Proceedings of the Geological\r\nSociety” (volume 3 page 317), described carefully some of these masses.\r\nIn the “Voyage a l’Isle de France, par un Officier du Roi,” many\r\ninteresting facts are given on this subject. Consult also “Voyage aux\r\nQuatre Isles d’Afrique, par M. Bory St. Vincent.”) Between Tamarin Bay\r\nand the Great Black River I observed, in company with Captain Lloyd,\r\ntwo hillocks of coral-rock, formed in their lower part of hard\r\ncalcareous sandstone, and in their upper of great blocks, slightly\r\naggregated, of Astraea and Madrepora, and of fragments of basalt; they\r\nwere divided into beds dipping seaward, in one case at an angle of 8\r\ndegrees, and in the other at 18 degrees; they had a water-worn\r\nappearance, and they rose abruptly from a smooth surface, strewed with\r\nrolled debris of organic remains, to a height of about twenty feet. The\r\nOfficier du Roi, in his most interesting tour in 1768 round the island,\r\nhas described masses of upraised coral-rocks, still retaining that\r\nmoat-like structure (see my “Coral Reefs”) which is characteristic of\r\nthe living reefs. On the coast northward of Port Louis, I found the\r\nlava concealed for a considerable space inland by a conglomerate of\r\ncorals and shells, like those on the beach, but in parts consolidated\r\nby red ferruginous matter. M. Bory St. Vincent has described similar\r\ncalcareous beds over nearly the whole of the plain of Pamplemousses.\r\nNear Port Louis, when turning over some large stones, which lay in the\r\nbed of a stream at the head of a protected creek, and at the height of\r\nsome yards above the level of spring tides, I found several shells of\r\nserpula still adhering to their under sides.\r\n\r\nThe jagged mountains near Port Louis rise to a height of between two\r\nand three thousand feet; they consist of strata of basalt, obscurely\r\nseparated from each other by firmly aggregated beds of fragmentary\r\nmatter; and they are intersected by a few vertical dikes. The basalt in\r\nsome parts abounds with large crystals of augite and olivine, and is\r\ngenerally compact. The interior of the island forms a plain, raised\r\nprobably about a thousand feet above the level of the sea, and composed\r\nof streams of lava which have flowed round and between the rugged\r\nbasaltic mountains. These more recent lavas are also basaltic, but less\r\ncompact, and some of them abound with feldspar, so that they even fuse\r\ninto a pale coloured glass. On the banks of the Great River, a section\r\nis exposed nearly five hundred feet deep, worn through numerous thin\r\nsheets of the lava of this series, which are separated from each other\r\nby beds of scoriae. They seem to have been of subaerial formation, and\r\nto have flowed from several points of eruption on the central platform,\r\nof which the Piton du Milieu is said to be the principal one. There are\r\nalso several volcanic cones, apparently of this modern period, round\r\nthe circumference of the island, especially at the northern end, where\r\nthey form separate islets.\r\n\r\nThe mountains composed of the more compact and crystalline basalt, form\r\nthe main skeleton of the island. M. Bailly (“Voyage aux Terres\r\nAustrales” tome 1 page 54.) states that they all “se developpent autour\r\nd’elle comme une ceinture d’immenses remparts, toutes affectant une\r\npente plus ou moins enclinee vers le rivage de la mer; tandis, au\r\ncontraire, que vers le centre de l’ile elles presentent une coupe\r\nabrupte, et souvent taillee a pic. Toutes ces montagnes sont formees de\r\ncouches paralleles inclinees du centre de l’ile vers la mer.” These\r\nstatements have been disputed, though not in detail, by M. Quoy, in the\r\nvoyage of Freycinet. As far as my limited means of observation went, I\r\nfound them perfectly correct. (M. Lesson, in his account of this\r\nisland, in the “Voyage of the ‘Coquille’,” seems to follow M. Bailly’s\r\nviews.) The mountains on the N.W. side of the island, which I examined,\r\nnamely, La Pouce, Peter Botts, Corps de Garde, Les Mamelles, and\r\napparently another farther southward, have precisely the external shape\r\nand stratification described by M. Bailly. They form about a quarter of\r\nhis girdle of ramparts. Although these mountains now stand quite\r\ndetached, being separated from each other by breaches, even several\r\nmiles in width, through which deluges of lava have flowed from the\r\ninterior of the island; nevertheless, seeing their close general\r\nsimilarity, one must feel convinced that they originally formed parts\r\nof one continuous mass. Judging from the beautiful map of the\r\nMauritius, published by the Admiralty from a French MS., there is a\r\nrange of mountains (M. Bamboo) on the opposite side of the island,\r\nwhich correspond in height, relative position, and external form, with\r\nthose just described. Whether the girdle was ever complete may well be\r\ndoubted; but from M. Bailly’s statements, and my own observations, it\r\nmay be safely concluded that mountains with precipitous inland flanks,\r\nand composed of strata dipping outwards, once extended round a\r\nconsiderable portion of the circumference of the island. The ring\r\nappears to have been oval and of vast size; its shorter axis, measured\r\nacross from the inner sides of the mountains near Port Louis and those\r\nnear Grand Port, being no less than thirteen geographical miles in\r\nlength. M. Bailly boldly supposes that this enormous gulf, which has\r\nsince been filled up to a great extent by streams of modern lava, was\r\nformed by the sinking in of the whole upper part of one great volcano.\r\n\r\nIt is singular in how many respects those portions of St. Jago and of\r\nMauritius which I visited agree in their geological history. At both\r\nislands, mountains of similar external form, stratification, and (at\r\nleast in their upper beds) composition, follow in a curved chain the\r\ncoast-line. These mountains in each case appear originally to have\r\nformed parts of one continuous mass. The basaltic strata of which they\r\nare composed, from their compact and crystalline structure, seem, when\r\ncontrasted with the neighbouring basaltic streams of subaerial\r\nformation, to have flowed beneath the pressure of the sea, and to have\r\nbeen subsequently elevated. We may suppose that the wide breaches\r\nbetween the mountains were in both cases worn by the waves, during\r\ntheir gradual elevation—of which process, within recent times, there is\r\nabundant evidence on the coast-land of both islands. At both, vast\r\nstreams of more recent basaltic lavas have flowed from the interior of\r\nthe island, round and between the ancient basaltic hills; at both,\r\nmoreover, recent cones of eruption are scattered around the\r\ncircumference of the island; but at neither have eruptions taken place\r\nwithin the period of history. As remarked in the last chapter, it is\r\nprobable that these ancient basaltic mountains, which resemble (at\r\nleast in many respects) the basal and disturbed remnants of two\r\ngigantic volcanoes, owe their present form, structure, and position, to\r\nthe action of similar causes.\r\n\r\nST. PAUL’S ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThis small island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, nearly one degree\r\nnorth of the equator, and 540 miles distant from South America, in 29\r\ndegrees 15 minutes west longitude. Its highest point is scarcely fifty\r\nfeet above the level of the sea; its outline is irregular, and its\r\nentire circumference barely three-quarters of a mile. This little point\r\nof rock rises abruptly out of the ocean; and, except on its western\r\nside, soundings were not obtained, even at the short distance of a\r\nquarter of a mile from its shore. It is not of volcanic origin; and\r\nthis circumstance, which is the most remarkable point in its history\r\n(as will hereafter be referred to), properly ought to exclude it from\r\nthe present volume. It is composed of rocks, unlike any which I have\r\nmet with, and which I cannot characterise by any name, and must\r\ntherefore describe.\r\n\r\nThe simplest, and one of the most abundant kinds, is a very compact,\r\nheavy, greenish-black rock, having an angular, irregular fracture, with\r\nsome points just hard enough to scratch glass, and infusible. This\r\nvariety passes into others of paler green tints, less hard, but with a\r\nmore crystalline fracture, and translucent on their edges; and these\r\nare fusible into a green enamel. Several other varieties are chiefly\r\ncharacterised by containing innumerable threads of dark-green\r\nserpentine, and by having calcareous matter in their interstices. These\r\nrocks have an obscure, concretionary structure, and are full of\r\nvariously coloured angular pseudo fragments. These angular pseudo\r\nfragments consist of the first-described dark green rock, of a brown\r\nsofter kind, of serpentine, and of a yellowish harsh stone, which,\r\nperhaps, is related to serpentine rock. There are other vesicular,\r\ncalcareo-ferruginous, soft stones. There is no distinct stratification,\r\nbut parts are imperfectly laminated; and the whole abounds with\r\ninnumerable veins, and vein-like masses, both small and large. Of these\r\nvein-like masses, some calcareous ones, which contain minute fragments\r\nof shells, are clearly of subsequent origin to the others.\r\n\r\nA GLOSSY INCRUSTATION.\r\n\r\nExtensive portions of these rocks are coated by a layer of a glossy\r\npolished substance, with a pearly lustre and of a greyish white colour;\r\nit follows all the inequalities of the surface, to which it is firmly\r\nattached. When examined with a lens, it is found to consist of numerous\r\nexceedingly thin layers, their aggregate thickness being about the\r\ntenth of an inch. It is considerably harder than calcareous spar, but\r\ncan be scratched with a knife; under the blowpipe it scales off,\r\ndecrepitates, slightly blackens, emits a fetid odour, and becomes\r\nstrongly alkaline: it does not effervesce in acids. (In my “Journal” I\r\nhave described this substance; I then believed that it was an impure\r\nphosphate of lime.) I presume this substance has been deposited by\r\nwater draining from the birds’ dung, with which the rocks are covered.\r\nAt Ascension, near a cavity in the rocks which was filled with a\r\nlaminated mass of infiltrated birds’ dung, I found some irregularly\r\nformed, stalactitical masses of apparently the same nature. These\r\nmasses, when broken, had an earthy texture; but on their outsides, and\r\nespecially at their extremities, they were formed of a pearly\r\nsubstance, generally in little globules, like the enamel of teeth, but\r\nmore translucent, and so hard as just to scratch plate-glass. This\r\nsubstance slightly blackens under the blowpipe, emits a bad smell, then\r\nbecomes quite white, swelling a little, and fuses into a dull white\r\nenamel; it does not become alkaline; nor does it effervesce in acids.\r\nThe whole mass had a collapsed appearance, as if in the formation of\r\nthe hard glossy crust the whole had shrunk much. At the Abrolhos\r\nIslands on the coast of Brazil, where also there is much birds’ dung, I\r\nfound a great quantity of a brown, arborescent substance adhering to\r\nsome trap-rock. In its arborescent form, this substance singularly\r\nresembles some of the branched species of Nullipora. Under the\r\nblowpipe, it behaves like the specimens from Ascension; but it is less\r\nhard and glossy, and the surface has not the shrunk appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nASCENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasaltic lavas.

Remarkable laminated beds,\r\nalternating with, and passing into, obsidian. Origin of obsidian.\r\nLamination of volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n(MAP 2: THE ISLAND OF ASCENSION.)\r\n\r\nThis island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, in latitude 8 degrees\r\nS., longitude 14 degrees W. It has the form of an irregular triangle\r\n(see Map 2), each side being about six miles in length. Its highest\r\npoint is 2,870 feet (“Geographical Journal” volume 5 page 243.) above\r\nthe level of the sea. The whole is volcanic, and, from the absence of\r\nproofs to the contrary, I believe of subaerial origin. The fundamental\r\nrock is everywhere of a pale colour, generally compact, and of a\r\nfeldspathic nature. In the S.E. portion of the island, where the\r\nhighest land is situated, well characterised trachyte, and other\r\ncongenerous rocks of that varying family, occur. Nearly the entire\r\ncircumference is covered up by black and rugged streams of basaltic\r\nlava, with here and there a hill or single point of rock (one of which\r\nnear the sea-coast, north of the Fort, is only two or three yards\r\nacross) of the trachyte still remaining exposed.\r\n\r\nBASALTIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe overlying basaltic lava is in some parts extremely vesicular, in\r\nothers little so; it is of a black colour, but sometimes contains\r\ncrystals of glassy feldspar, and seldom much olivine. These streams\r\nappear to have possessed singularly little fluidity; their side walls\r\nand lower ends being very steep, and even as much as between twenty and\r\nthirty feet in height. Their surface is extraordinarily rugged, and\r\nfrom a short distance appears as if studded with small craters. These\r\nprojections consist of broad, irregularly conical, hillocks, traversed\r\nby fissures, and composed of the same unequally scoriaceous basalt with\r\nthe surrounding streams, but having an obscure tendency to a columnar\r\nstructure; they rise to a height between ten and thirty feet above the\r\ngeneral surface, and have been formed, as I presume, by the heaping up\r\nof the viscid lava at points of greater resistance. At the base of\r\nseveral of these hillocks, and occasionally likewise on more level\r\nparts, solid ribs, composed of angulo-globular masses of basalt,\r\nresembling in size and outline arched sewers or gutters of brickwork,\r\nbut not being hollow, project between two or three feet above the\r\nsurface of the streams; what their origin may have been, I do not know.\r\nMany of the superficial fragments from these basaltic streams present\r\nsingularly convoluted forms; and some specimens could hardly be\r\ndistinguished from logs of dark-coloured wood without their bark.\r\n\r\nMany of the basaltic streams can be traced, either to points of\r\neruption at the base of the great central mass of trachyte, or to\r\nseparate, conical, red-coloured hills, which are scattered over the\r\nnorthern and western borders of the island. Standing on the central\r\neminence, I counted between twenty and thirty of these cones of\r\neruption. The greater number of them had their truncated summits cut\r\noff obliquely, and they all sloped towards the S.E., whence the\r\ntrade-wind blows. (M. Lesson in the “Zoology of the Voyage of the\r\n‘Coquille’” page 490 has observed this fact. Mr. Hennah (“Geolog.\r\nProceedings” 1835 page 189) further remarks that the most extensive\r\nbeds of ashes at Ascension invariably occur on the leeward side of the\r\nisland.) This structure no doubt has been caused by the ejected\r\nfragments and ashes being always blown, during eruptions, in greater\r\nquantity towards one side than towards the other. M. Moreau de Jonnes\r\nhas made a similar observation with respect to the volcanic orifices in\r\nthe West Indian Islands.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC BOMBS.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 3: FRAGMENT OF A SPHERICAL VOLCANIC BOMB, with the interior\r\nparts coarsely cellular, coated by a concentric layer of compact lava,\r\nand this again by a crust of finely cellular rock.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 4: VOLCANIC BOMB OF OBSIDIAN FROM AUSTRALIA. The upper figure\r\ngives a front view; the lower a side view of the same object.)\r\n\r\nThese occur in great numbers strewed on the ground, and some of them\r\nlie at considerable distances from any points of eruption. They vary in\r\nsize from that of an apple to that of a man’s body; they are either\r\nspherical or pear-shaped, or with the hinder part (corresponding to the\r\ntail of a comet) irregular, studded with projecting points, and even\r\nconcave. Their surfaces are rough, and fissured with branching cracks;\r\ntheir internal structure is either irregularly scoriaceous and compact,\r\nor it presents a symmetrical and very curious appearance. An irregular\r\nsegment of a bomb of this latter kind, of which I found several, is\r\naccurately represented in Figure 3. Its size was about that of a man’s\r\nhead. The whole interior is coarsely cellular; the cells averaging in\r\ndiameter about the tenth of an inch; but nearer the outside they\r\ngradually decrease in size. This part is succeeded by a well-defined\r\nshell of compact lava, having a nearly uniform thickness of about the\r\nthird of an inch; and the shell is overlaid by a somewhat thicker\r\ncoating of finely cellular lava (the cells varying from the fiftieth to\r\nthe hundredth of an inch in diameter), which forms the external\r\nsurface: the line separating the shell of compact lava from the outer\r\nscoriaceous crust is distinctly defined. This structure is very simply\r\nexplained, if we suppose a mass of viscid, scoriaceous matter, to be\r\nprojected with a rapid, rotatory motion through the air; for whilst the\r\nexternal crust, from cooling, became solidified (in the state we now\r\nsee it), the centrifugal force, by relieving the pressure in the\r\ninterior parts of the bomb, would allow the heated vapours to expand\r\ntheir cells; but these being driven by the same force against the\r\nalready-hardened crust, would become, the nearer they were to this\r\npart, smaller and smaller or less expanded, until they became packed\r\ninto a solid, concentric shell. As we know that chips from a grindstone\r\n(Nichol “Architecture of the Heavens.”) can be flirted off, when made\r\nto revolve with sufficient velocity, we need not doubt that the\r\ncentrifugal force would have power to modify the structure of a\r\nsoftened bomb, in the manner here supposed. Geologists have remarked,\r\nthat the external form of a bomb at once bespeaks the history of its\r\naerial course, and few now see that the internal structure can speak,\r\nwith almost equal plainness, of its rotatory movement.\r\n\r\nM. Bory St. Vincent (“Voyage aux Quatre Isles d’Afrique” tome 1 page\r\n222.) has described some balls of lava from the Isle of Bourbon, which\r\nhave a closely similar structure. His explanation, however (if I\r\nunderstand it rightly), is very different from that which I have given;\r\nfor he supposes that they have rolled, like snowballs, down the sides\r\nof the crater. M. Beudant (“Voyage en Hongrie” tome 2 page 214.), also,\r\nhas described some singular little balls of obsidian, never more than\r\nsix or eight inches in diameter, which he found strewed on the surface\r\nof the ground: their form is always oval; sometimes they are much\r\nswollen in the middle, and even spindle-shaped: their surface is\r\nregularly marked with concentric ridges and furrows, all of which on\r\nthe same ball are at right angles to one axis: their interior is\r\ncompact and glassy. M. Beudant supposes that masses of lava, when soft,\r\nwere shot into the air, with a rotatory movement round the same axis,\r\nand that the form and superficial ridges of the bombs were thus\r\nproduced. Sir Thomas Mitchell has given me what at first appears to be\r\nthe half of a much flattened oval ball of obsidian; it has a singular\r\nartificial-like appearance, which is well represented (of the natural\r\nsize) in Figure 4. It was found in its present state, on a great sandy\r\nplain between the rivers Darling and Murray, in Australia, and at the\r\ndistance of several hundred miles from any known volcanic region. It\r\nseems to have been embedded in some reddish tufaceous matter; and may\r\nhave been transported either by the aborigines or by natural means. The\r\nexternal saucer consists of compact obsidian, of a bottle-green colour,\r\nand is filled with finely cellular black lava, much less transparent\r\nand glassy than the obsidian. The external surface is marked with four\r\nor five not quite perfect ridges, which are represented rather too\r\ndistinctly in Figure 4. Here, then, we have the external structure\r\ndescribed by M. Beudant, and the internal cellular condition of the\r\nbombs from Ascension. The lip of the saucer is slightly concave,\r\nexactly like the margin of a soup-plate, and its inner edge overlaps a\r\nlittle the central cellular lava. This structure is so symmetrical\r\nround the entire circumference, that one is forced to suppose that the\r\nbomb burst during its rotatory course, before being quite solidified,\r\nand that the lip and edges were thus slightly modified and turned\r\ninwards. It may be remarked that the superficial ridges are in planes,\r\nat right angles to an axis, transverse to the longer axis of the\r\nflattened oval: to explain this circumstance, we may suppose that when\r\nthe bomb burst, the axis of rotation changed.\r\n\r\nAERIFORM EXPLOSIONS.\r\n\r\nThe flanks of Green Mountain and the surrounding country are covered by\r\na great mass, some hundred feet in thickness, of loose fragments. The\r\nlower beds generally consist of fine-grained, slightly consolidated\r\ntuffs (Some of this peperino, or tuff, is sufficiently hard not to be\r\nbroken by the greatest force of the fingers.), and the upper beds of\r\ngreat loose fragments, with alternating finer beds. (On the northern\r\nside of the Green Mountain a thin seam, about an inch in thickness, of\r\ncompact oxide of iron, extends over a considerable area; it lies\r\nconformably in the lower part of the stratified mass of ashes and\r\nfragments. This substance is of a reddish- brown colour, with an almost\r\nmetallic lustre; it is not magnetic, but becomes so after having been\r\nheated under the blowpipe, by which it is blackened and partly fused.\r\nThis seam of compact stone, by intercepting the little rain-water which\r\nfalls on the island, gives rise to a small dripping spring, first\r\ndiscovered by Dampier. It is the only fresh water on the island, so\r\nthat the possibility of its being inhabited has entirely depended on\r\nthe occurrence of this ferruginous layer.) One white ribbon- like layer\r\nof decomposed, pumiceous breccia, was curiously bent into deep unbroken\r\ncurves, beneath each of the large fragments in the superincumbent\r\nstratum. From the relative position of these beds, I presume that a\r\nnarrow- mouthed crater, standing nearly in the position of Green\r\nMountain, like a great air-gun, shot forth, before its final\r\nextinction, this vast accumulation of loose matter. Subsequently to\r\nthis event, considerable dislocations have taken place, and an oval\r\ncircus has been formed by subsidence. This sunken space lies at the\r\nnorth-eastern foot of Green Mountain, and is well represented in Map 2.\r\nIts longer axis, which is connected with a N.E. and S.W. line of\r\nfissure, is three-fifths of a nautical mile in length; its sides are\r\nnearly perpendicular, except in one spot, and about four hundred feet\r\nin height; they consist, in the lower part, of a pale basalt with\r\nfeldspar, and in the upper part, of the tuff and loose ejected\r\nfragments; the bottom is smooth and level, and under almost any other\r\nclimate a deep lake would have been formed here. From the thickness of\r\nthe bed of loose fragments, with which the surrounding country is\r\ncovered, the amount of aeriform matter necessary for their projection\r\nmust have been enormous; hence we may suppose it probable that after\r\nthe explosions vast subterranean caverns were left, and that the\r\nfalling in of the roof of one of these produced the hollow here\r\ndescribed. At the Galapagos Archipelago, pits of a similar character,\r\nbut of a much smaller size, frequently occur at the bases of small\r\ncones of eruption.\r\n\r\nEJECTED GRANITIC FRAGMENTS.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Green Mountain, fragments of extraneous rock\r\nare not unfrequently found embedded in the midst of masses of scoriae.\r\nLieutenant Evans, to whose kindness I am indebted for much information,\r\ngave me several specimens, and I found others myself. They nearly all\r\nhave a granitic structure, are brittle, harsh to the touch, and\r\napparently of altered colours.\r\n\r\nFIRST, a white syenite, streaked and mottled with red; it consists of\r\nwell- crystallised feldspar, numerous grains of quartz, and brilliant,\r\nthough small, crystals of hornblende. The feldspar and hornblende in\r\nthis and the succeeding cases have been determined by the reflecting\r\ngoniometer, and the quartz by its action under the blowpipe. The\r\nfeldspar in these ejected fragments, like the glassy kind in the\r\ntrachyte, is from its cleavage a potash-feldspar.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY, a brick-red mass of feldspar, quartz, and small dark patches\r\nof a decayed mineral; one minute particle of which I was able to\r\nascertain, by its cleavage, to be hornblende.\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY, a mass of confusedly crystallised white feldspar, with little\r\nnests of a dark-coloured mineral, often carious, externally rounded,\r\nhaving a glossy fracture, but no distinct cleavage: from comparison\r\nwith the second specimen, I have no doubt that it is fused hornblende.\r\n\r\nFOURTHLY, a rock, which at first appears a simple aggregation of\r\ndistinct and large-sized crystals of dusty-coloured Labrador feldspar\r\n(Professor Miller has been so kind as to examine this mineral. He\r\nobtained two good cleavages of 86 degrees 30 minutes and 86 degrees 50\r\nminutes. The mean of several, which I made, was 86 degrees 30 minutes.\r\nProfessor Miller states that these crystals, when reduced to a fine\r\npowder, are soluble in hydrochloric acid, leaving some undissolved\r\nsilex behind; the addition of oxalate of ammonia gives a copious\r\nprecipitate of lime. He further remarks, that according to Von Kobell,\r\nanorthite (a mineral occurring in the ejected fragments at Mount Somma)\r\nis always white and transparent, so that if this be the case, these\r\ncrystals from Ascension must be considered as Labrador feldspar.\r\nProfessor Miller adds, that he has seen an account, in Erdmann’s\r\n“Journal fur tecnische Chemie,” of a mineral ejected from a volcano\r\nwhich had the external characters of Labrador feldspar, but differed in\r\nthe analysis from that given by mineralogists of this mineral: the\r\nauthor attributed this difference to an error in the analysis of\r\nLabrador feldspar, which is very old.); but in their interstices there\r\nis some white granular feldspar, abundant scales of mica, a little\r\naltered hornblende, and, as I believe, no quartz. I have described\r\nthese fragments in detail, because it is rare to find granitic rocks\r\nejected from volcanoes with their MINERALS UNCHANGED, as is the case\r\nwith the first specimen, and partially with the second. (Daubeny, in\r\nhis work on Volcanoes page 386, remarks that this is the case; and\r\nHumboldt, in his “Personal Narrative” volume 1 page 236, says “In\r\ngeneral, the masses of known primitive rocks, I mean those which\r\nperfectly resemble our granites, gneiss, and mica-slate, are very rare\r\nin lavas: the substances we generally denote by the name of granite,\r\nthrown out by Vesuvius, are mixtures of nepheline, mica, and\r\npyroxene.”) One other large fragment, found in another spot, is\r\ndeserving of notice; it is a conglomerate, containing small fragments\r\nof granitic, cellular, and jaspery rocks, and of hornstone porphyries,\r\nembedded in a base of wacke, threaded by numerous thin layers of a\r\nconcretionary pitchstone passing into obsidian. These layers are\r\nparallel, slightly tortuous, and short; they thin out at their ends,\r\nand resemble in form the layers of quartz in gneiss. It is probable\r\nthat these small embedded fragments were not separately ejected, but\r\nwere entangled in a fluid volcanic rock, allied to obsidian; and we\r\nshall presently see that several varieties of this latter series of\r\nrock assume a laminated structure.\r\n\r\nTRACHYTIC SERIES OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThose occupy the more elevated and central, and likewise the\r\nsouth-eastern, parts of the island. The trachyte is generally of a pale\r\nbrown colour, stained with small darker patches; it contains broken and\r\nbent crystals of glassy feldspar, grains of specular iron, and black\r\nmicroscopical points, which latter, from being easily fused, and then\r\nbecoming magnetic, I presume are hornblende. The greater number of the\r\nhills, however, are composed of a quite white, friable stone, appearing\r\nlike a trachytic tuff. Obsidian, hornstone, and several kinds of\r\nlaminated feldspathic rocks, are associated with the trachyte. There is\r\nno distinct stratification; nor could I distinguish a crateriform\r\nstructure in any of the hills of this series. Considerable dislocations\r\nhave taken place; and many fissures in these rocks are yet left open,\r\nor are only partially filled with loose fragments. Within the space\r\n(This space is nearly included by a line sweeping round Green Mountain,\r\nand joining the hills, called the Weather Port Signal, Holyhead, and\r\nthat denominated (improperly in a geological sense) “the Crater of an\r\nold volcano.”), mainly formed of trachyte, some basaltic streams have\r\nburst forth; and not far from the summit of Green Mountain, there is\r\none stream of quite black, vesicular basalt, containing minute crystals\r\nof glassy feldspar, which have a rounded appearance.\r\n\r\nThe soft white stone above mentioned is remarkable from its singular\r\nresemblance, when viewed in mass, to a sedimentary tuff: it was long\r\nbefore I could persuade myself that such was not its origin; and other\r\ngeologists have been perplexed by closely similar formations in\r\ntrachytic regions. In two cases, this white earthy stone formed\r\nisolated hills; in a third, it was associated with columnar and\r\nlaminated trachyte; but I was unable to trace an actual junction. It\r\ncontains numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and black microscopical\r\nspecks, and is marked with small darker patches, exactly as in the\r\nsurrounding trachyte. Its basis, however, when viewed under the\r\nmicroscope, is generally quite earthy; but sometimes it exhibits a\r\ndecidedly crystalline structure. On the hill marked “Crater of an old\r\nvolcano,” it passes into a pale greenish-grey variety, differing only\r\nin its colour, and in not being so earthy; the passage was in one case\r\neffected insensibly; in another, it was formed by numerous, rounded and\r\nangular, masses of the greenish variety, being embedded in the white\r\nvariety;—in this latter case, the appearance was very much like that of\r\na sedimentary deposit, torn up and abraded during the deposition of a\r\nsubsequent stratum. Both these varieties are traversed by innumerable\r\ntortuous veins (presently to be described), which are totally unlike\r\ninjected dikes, or indeed any other veins which I have ever seen. Both\r\nvarieties include a few scattered fragments, large and small, of dark-\r\ncoloured scoriaceous rocks, the cells of some of which are partially\r\nfilled with the white earthy stone; they likewise include some huge\r\nblocks of a cellular porphyry. (The porphyry is dark coloured; it\r\ncontains numerous, often fractured, crystals of white opaque feldspar,\r\nalso decomposing crystals of oxide of iron; its vesicles include masses\r\nof delicate, hair- like, crystals, apparently of analcime.) These\r\nfragments project from the weathered surface, and perfectly resemble\r\nfragments embedded in a true sedimentary tuff. But as it is known that\r\nextraneous fragments of cellular rock are sometimes included in\r\ncolumnar trachyte, in phonolite (D’Aubuisson “Traite de Geognosie” tome\r\n2 page 548.), and in other compact lavas, this circumstance is not any\r\nreal argument for the sedimentary origin of the white earthy stone.\r\n(Dr. Daubeny on Volcanoes, page 180 seems to have been led to believe\r\nthat certain trachytic formations of Ischia and of the Puy de Dome,\r\nwhich closely resemble these of Ascension, were of sedimentary origin,\r\nchiefly from the frequent presence in them “of scoriform portions,\r\ndifferent in colour from the matrix.” Dr. Daubeny adds, that on the\r\nother hand, Brocchi, and other eminent geologists, have considered\r\nthese beds as earthy varieties of trachyte; he considers the subject\r\ndeserving of further attention.) The insensible passage of the greenish\r\nvariety into the white one, and likewise the more abrupt passage by\r\nfragments of the former being embedded in the latter, might result from\r\nslight differences in the composition of the same mass of molten stone,\r\nand from the abrading action of one such part still fluid on another\r\npart already solidified. The curiously formed veins have, I believe,\r\nbeen formed by siliceous matter being subsequently segregated. But my\r\nchief reason for believing that these soft earthy stones, with their\r\nextraneous fragments, are not of sedimentary origin, is the extreme\r\nimprobability of crystals of feldspar, black microscopical specks, and\r\nsmall stains of a darker colour occurring in the same proportional\r\nnumbers in an aqueous deposit, and in masses of solid trachyte.\r\nMoreover, as I have remarked, the microscope occasionally reveals a\r\ncrystalline structure in the apparently earthy basis. On the other\r\nhand, the partial decomposition of such great masses of trachyte,\r\nforming whole mountains, is undoubtedly a circumstance of not easy\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nVEINS IN THE EARTHY TRACHYTIC MASSES.\r\n\r\nThese veins are extraordinarily numerous, intersecting in the most\r\ncomplicated manner both coloured varieties of the earthy trachyte: they\r\nare best seen on the flanks of the “Crater of the old volcano.” They\r\ncontain crystals of glassy feldspar, black microscopical specks and\r\nlittle dark stains, precisely as in the surrounding rock; but the basis\r\nis very different, being exceedingly hard, compact, somewhat brittle,\r\nand of rather less easy fusibility. The veins vary much, and suddenly,\r\nfrom the tenth of an inch to one inch in thickness; they often thin\r\nout, not only on their edges, but in their central parts, thus leaving\r\nround, irregular apertures; their surfaces are rugged. They are\r\ninclined at every possible angle with the horizon, or are horizontal;\r\nthey are generally curvilinear, and often interbranch one with another.\r\nFrom their hardness they withstand weathering, and projecting two or\r\nthree feet above the ground, they occasionally extend some yards in\r\nlength; these plate-like veins, when struck, emit a sound, almost like\r\nthat of a drum, and they may be distinctly seen to vibrate; their\r\nfragments, which are strewed on the ground, clatter like pieces of iron\r\nwhen knocked against each other. They often assume the most singular\r\nforms; I saw a pedestal of the earthy trachyte, covered by a\r\nhemispherical portion of a vein, like a great umbrella, sufficiently\r\nlarge to shelter two persons. I have never met with, or seen described,\r\nany veins like these; but in form they resemble the ferruginous seams,\r\ndue to some process of segregation, occurring not uncommonly in\r\nsandstones,—for instance, in the New Red sandstone of England. Numerous\r\nveins of jasper and of siliceous sinter, occurring on the summit of\r\nthis same hill, show that there has been some abundant source of\r\nsilica, and as these plate-like veins differ from the trachyte only in\r\ntheir greater hardness, brittleness, and less easy fusibility, it\r\nappears probable that their origin is due to the segregation or\r\ninfiltration of siliceous matter, in the same manner as happens with\r\nthe oxides of iron in many sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nSILICEOUS SINTER AND JASPER.\r\n\r\nThe siliceous sinter is either quite white, of little specific gravity,\r\nand with a somewhat pearly fracture, passing into pinkish pearl quartz;\r\nor it is yellowish white, with a harsh fracture, and it then contains\r\nan earthy powder in small cavities. Both varieties occur, either in\r\nlarge irregular masses in the altered trachyte, or in seams included in\r\nbroad, vertical, tortuous, irregular veins of a compact, harsh stone of\r\na dull red colour, appearing like a sandstone. This stone, however, is\r\nonly altered trachyte; and a nearly similar variety, but often\r\nhoneycombed, sometimes adheres to the projecting plate-like veins,\r\ndescribed in the last paragraph. The jasper is of an ochre yellow or\r\nred colour; it occurs in large irregular masses, and sometimes in\r\nveins, both in the altered trachyte and in an associated mass of\r\nscoriaceous basalt. The cells of the scoriaceous basalt are lined or\r\nfilled with fine, concentric layers of chalcedony, coated and studded\r\nwith bright-red oxide of iron. In this rock, especially in the rather\r\nmore compact parts, irregular angular patches of the red jasper are\r\nincluded, the edges of which insensibly blend into the surrounding\r\nmass; other patches occur having an intermediate character between\r\nperfect jasper and the ferruginous, decomposed, basaltic base. In these\r\npatches, and likewise in the large vein-like masses of jasper, there\r\noccur little rounded cavities, of exactly the same size and form with\r\nthe air-cells, which in the scoriaceous basalt are filled and lined\r\nwith layers of chalcedony. Small fragments of the jasper, examined\r\nunder the microscope, seem to resemble the chalcedony with its\r\ncolouring matter not separated into layers, but mingled in the\r\nsiliceous paste, together with some impurities. I can understand these\r\nfacts,—namely, the blending of the jasper into the semi-decomposed\r\nbasalt,—its occurrence in angular patches, which clearly do not occupy\r\npre-existing hollows in the rock,—and its containing little vesicles\r\nfilled with chalcedony, like those in the scoriaceous lava,—only on the\r\nsupposition that a fluid, probably the same fluid which deposited the\r\nchalcedony in the air-cells, removed in those parts where there were no\r\ncavities, the ingredients of the basaltic rock, and left in their place\r\nsilica and iron, and thus produced the jasper. In some specimens of\r\nsilicified wood, I have observed, that in the same manner as in the\r\nbasalt, the solid parts were converted into a dark-coloured homogeneous\r\nstone, whereas the cavities formed by the larger sap-vessels (which may\r\nbe compared with the air-vesicles in the basaltic lava) and other\r\nirregular hollows, apparently produced by decay, were filled with\r\nconcentric layers of chalcedony; in this case, there can be little\r\ndoubt that the same fluid deposited the homogeneous base and the\r\nchalcedonic layers. After these considerations, I cannot doubt but that\r\nthe jasper of Ascension may be viewed as a volcanic rock silicified, in\r\nprecisely the same sense as this term is applied to wood, when\r\nsilicified; we are equally ignorant of the means by which every atom of\r\nwood, whilst in a perfect state, is removed and replaced by atoms of\r\nsilica, as we are of the means by which the constituent parts of a\r\nvolcanic rock could be thus acted on. (Beudant “Voyage en Hongrie” tome\r\n3 pages 502, 504 describes kidney-shaped masses of jasper-opal, which\r\neither blend into the surrounding trachytic conglomerate, or are\r\nembedded in it like chalk-flints; and he compares them with the\r\nfragments of opalised wood, which are abundant in this same formation.\r\nBeudant, however, appears to have viewed the process of their formation\r\nrather as one of simple infiltration than of molecular exchange; but\r\nthe presence of a concretion, wholly different from the surrounding\r\nmatter, if not formed in a pre-existing hollow, clearly seems to me to\r\nrequire, either a molecular or mechanical displacement of the atoms,\r\nwhich occupied the space afterwards filled by it. The jasper-opal of\r\nHungary passes into chalcedony, and therefore in this case, as in that\r\nof Ascension, jasper seems to be intimately related in origin with\r\nchalcedony.) I was led to the careful examination of these rocks, and\r\nto the conclusion here given, from having heard the Rev. Professor\r\nHenslow express a similar opinion, regarding the origin in trap-rocks\r\nof many chalcedonies and agates. Siliceous deposits seem to be very\r\ngeneral, if not of universal occurrence, in partially decomposed\r\ntrachytic tuffs (Beudant “Voyage Min.” tome 3 page 507 enumerates cases\r\nin Hungary, Germany, Central France, Italy, Greece, and Mexico.); and\r\nas these hills, according to the view above given, consist of trachyte\r\nsoftened and altered in situ, the presence of free silica in this case\r\nmay be added as one more instance to the list.\r\n\r\nCONCRETIONS IN PUMICEOUS TUFF.\r\n\r\nThe hill, marked in Map 2 “Crater of an old volcano,” has no claims to\r\nthis appellation, which I could discover, except in being surmounted by\r\na circular, very shallow, saucer-like summit, nearly half a mile in\r\ndiameter. This hollow has been nearly filled up with many successive\r\nsheets of ashes and scoriae, of different colours, and slightly\r\nconsolidated. Each successive saucer-shaped layer crops out all round\r\nthe margin, forming so many rings of various colours, and giving to the\r\nhill a fantastic appearance. The outer ring is broad, and of a white\r\ncolour; hence it resembles a course round which horses have been\r\nexercised, and has received the name of the Devil’s Riding School, by\r\nwhich it is most generally known. These successive layers of ashes must\r\nhave fallen over the whole surrounding country, but they have all been\r\nblown away except in this one hollow, in which probably moisture\r\naccumulated, either during an extraordinary year when rain fell, or\r\nduring the storms often accompanying volcanic eruptions. One of the\r\nlayers of a pinkish colour, and chiefly derived from small, decomposed\r\nfragments of pumice, is remarkable, from containing numerous\r\nconcretions. These are generally spherical, from half an inch to three\r\ninches in diameter; but they are occasionally cylindrical, like those\r\nof iron-pyrites in the chalk of Europe. They consist of a very tough,\r\ncompact, pale-brown stone, with a smooth and even fracture. They are\r\ndivided into concentric layers by thin white partitions, resembling the\r\nexternal superficies; six or eight of such layers are distinctly\r\ndefined near the outside; but those towards the inside generally become\r\nindistinct, and blend into a homogeneous mass. I presume that these\r\nconcentric layers were formed by the shrinking of the concretion, as it\r\nbecame compact. The interior part is generally fissured by minute\r\ncracks or septaria, which are lined, both by black, metallic, and by\r\nother white and crystalline specks, the nature of which I was unable to\r\nascertain. Some of the larger concretions consist of a mere spherical\r\nshell, filled with slightly consolidated ashes. The concretions contain\r\na small proportion of carbonate of lime: a fragment placed under the\r\nblowpipe decrepitates, then whitens and fuses into a blebby enamel, but\r\ndoes not become caustic. The surrounding ashes do not contain any\r\ncarbonate of lime; hence the concretions have probably been formed, as\r\nis so often the case, by the aggregation of this substance. I have not\r\nmet with any account of similar concretions; and considering their\r\ngreat toughness and compactness, their occurrence in a bed, which\r\nprobably has been subjected only to atmospheric moisture, is\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF CALCAREOUS ROCKS ON THE SEA-COAST.\r\n\r\nOn several of the sea-beaches, there are immense accumulations of\r\nsmall, well-rounded particles of shells and corals, of white,\r\nyellowish, and pink colours, interspersed with a few volcanic\r\nparticles. At the depth of a few feet, these are found cemented\r\ntogether into stone, of which the softer varieties are used for\r\nbuilding; there are other varieties, both coarse and fine-grained, too\r\nhard for this purpose: and I saw one mass divided into even layers half\r\nan inch in thickness, which were so compact that when struck with a\r\nhammer they rang like flint. It is believed by the inhabitants, that\r\nthe particles become united in the course of a single year. The union\r\nis effected by calcareous matter; and in the most compact varieties,\r\neach rounded particle of shell and volcanic rock can be distinctly seen\r\nto be enveloped in a husk of pellucid carbonate of lime. Extremely few\r\nperfect shells are embedded in these agglutinated masses; and I have\r\nexamined even a large fragment under a microscope, without being able\r\nto discover the least vestige of striae or other marks of external\r\nform: this shows how long each particle must have been rolled about,\r\nbefore its turn came to be embedded and cemented. (The eggs of the\r\nturtle being buried by the parent, sometimes become enclosed in the\r\nsolid rock. Mr. Lyell has given a figure (“Principles of Geology” book\r\n3 chapter 17) of some eggs, containing the bones of young turtles,\r\nfound thus entombed.) One of the most compact varieties, when placed in\r\nacid, was entirely dissolved, with the exception of some flocculent\r\nanimal matter; its specific gravity was 2.63. The specific gravity of\r\nordinary limestone varies from 2.6 to 2.75; pure Carrara marble was\r\nfound by Sir H. De la Beche to be 2.7. (“Researches in Theoretical\r\nGeology” page 12.) It is remarkable that these rocks of Ascension,\r\nformed close to the surface, should be nearly as compact as marble,\r\nwhich has undergone the action of heat and pressure in the plutonic\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe great accumulation of loose calcareous particles, lying on the\r\nbeach near the Settlement, commences in the month of October, moving\r\ntowards the S.W., which, as I was informed by Lieutenant Evans, is\r\ncaused by a change in the prevailing direction of the currents. At this\r\nperiod the tidal rocks, at the S.W. end of the beach, where the\r\ncalcareous sand is accumulating, and round which the currents sweep,\r\nbecome gradually coated with a calcareous incrustation, half an inch in\r\nthickness. It is quite white, compact, with some parts slightly\r\nspathose, and is firmly attached to the rock. After a short time it\r\ngradually disappears, being either redissolved, when the water is less\r\ncharged with lime, or more probably is mechanically abraded. Lieutenant\r\nEvans has observed these facts, during the six years he has resided at\r\nAscension. The incrustation varies in thickness in different years: in\r\n1831 it was unusually thick. When I was there in July, there was no\r\nremnant of the incrustation; but on a point of basalt, from which the\r\nquarrymen had lately removed a mass of the calcareous freestone, the\r\nincrustation was perfectly preserved. Considering the position of the\r\ntidal-rocks, and the period at which they become coated, there can be\r\nno doubt that the movement and disturbance of the vast accumulation of\r\ncalcareous particles, many of them being partially agglutinated\r\ntogether, cause the waves of the sea to be so highly charged with\r\ncarbonate of lime, that they deposit it on the first objects against\r\nwhich they impinge. I have been informed by Lieutenant Holland, R.N.,\r\nthat this incrustation is formed on many parts of the coast, on most of\r\nwhich, I believe, there are likewise great masses of comminuted shells.\r\n\r\nA FRONDESCENT CALCAREOUS INCRUSTATION.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 5. AN INCRUSTATION OF CALCAREOUS AND ANIMAL MATTER, coating the\r\ntidal-rocks at Ascension.)\r\n\r\nIn many respects this is a singular deposit; it coats throughout the\r\nyear the tidal volcanic rocks, that project from the beaches composed\r\nof broken shells. Its general appearance is well represented in Figure\r\n5; but the fronds or discs, of which it is composed, are generally so\r\nclosely crowded together as to touch. These fronds have their sinuous\r\nedges finely crenulated, and they project over their pedestals or\r\nsupports; their upper surfaces are either slightly concave, or slightly\r\nconvex; they are highly polished, and of a dark grey or jet black\r\ncolour; their form is irregular, generally circular, and from the tenth\r\nof an inch to one inch and a half in diameter; their thickness, or\r\namount of their projection from the rock on which they stand, varies\r\nmuch, about a quarter of an inch being perhaps most usual. The fronds\r\noccasionally become more and more convex, until they pass into\r\nbotryoidal masses with their summits fissured; when in this state, they\r\nare glossy and of an intense black, so as to resemble some fused\r\nmetallic substance. I have shown the incrustation, both in this latter\r\nand in its ordinary state to several geologists, but not one could\r\nconjecture its origin, except that perhaps it was of volcanic nature!\r\n\r\nThe substance forming the fronds has a very compact and often almost\r\ncrystalline fracture; the edges being translucent, and hard enough\r\neasily to scratch calcareous spar. Under the blowpipe it immediately\r\nbecomes white, and emits a strong animal odour, like that from fresh\r\nshells. It is chiefly composed of carbonate of lime; when placed in\r\nmuriatic acid it froths much, leaving a residue of sulphate of lime,\r\nand of an oxide of iron, together with a black powder, which is not\r\nsoluble in heated acids. This latter substance seems to be\r\ncarbonaceous, and is evidently the colouring matter. The sulphate of\r\nlime is extraneous, and occurs in distinct, excessively minute,\r\nlamellar plates, studded on the surface of the fronds, and embedded\r\nbetween the fine layers of which they are composed; when a fragment is\r\nheated in the blowpipe, these lamellae are immediately rendered\r\nvisible. The original outline of the fronds may often be traced, either\r\nto a minute particle of shell fixed in a crevice of the rock, or to\r\nseveral cemented together; these first become deeply corroded, by the\r\ndissolving power of the waves, into sharp ridges, and then are coated\r\nwith successive layers of the glossy, grey, calcareous incrustation.\r\nThe inequalities of the primary support affect the outline of every\r\nsuccessive layer, in the same manner as may often be seen in\r\nbezoar-stones, when an object like a nail forms the centre of\r\naggregation. The crenulated edges, however, of the frond appear to be\r\ndue to the corroding power of the surf on its own deposit, alternating\r\nwith fresh depositions. On some smooth basaltic rocks on the coast of\r\nSt. Jago, I found an exceedingly thin layer of brown calcareous matter,\r\nwhich under a lens presented a miniature likeness of the crenulated and\r\npolished fronds of Ascension; in this case a basis was not afforded by\r\nany projecting extraneous particles. Although the incrustation at\r\nAscension is persistent throughout the year; yet from the abraded\r\nappearance of some parts, and from the fresh appearance of other parts,\r\nthe whole seems to undergo a round of decay and renovation, due\r\nprobably to changes in the form of the shifting beach, and consequently\r\nin the action of the breakers: hence probably it is, that the\r\nincrustation never acquires a great thickness. Considering the position\r\nof the encrusted rocks in the midst of the calcareous beach, together\r\nwith its composition, I think there can be no doubt that its origin is\r\ndue to the dissolution and subsequent deposition of the matter\r\ncomposing the rounded particles of shells and corals. (The selenite, as\r\nI have remarked is extraneous, and must have been derived from the\r\nsea-water. It is an interesting circumstance thus to find the waves of\r\nthe ocean, sufficiently charged with sulphate of lime, to deposit it on\r\nthe rocks, against which they dash every tide. Dr. Webster has\r\ndescribed (“Voyage of the ‘Chanticleer’” volume 2 page 319) beds of\r\ngypsum and salt, as much as two feet in thickness, left by the\r\nevaporation of the spray on the rocks on the windward coast. Beautiful\r\nstalactites of selenite, resembling in form those of carbonate of lime,\r\nare formed near these beds. Amorphous masses of gypsum, also, occur in\r\ncaverns in the interior of the island; and at Cross Hill (an old\r\ncrater) I saw a considerable quantity of salt oozing from a pile of\r\nscoriae. In these latter cases, the salt and gypsum appear to be\r\nvolcanic products.) From this source it derives its animal matter,\r\nwhich is evidently the colouring principle. The nature of the deposit,\r\nin its incipient stage, can often be well seen upon a fragment of white\r\nshell, when jammed between two of the fronds; it then appears exactly\r\nlike the thinnest wash of a pale grey varnish. Its darkness varies a\r\nlittle, but the jet blackness of some of the fronds and of the\r\nbotryoidal masses seems due to the translucency of the successive grey\r\nlayers. There is, however, this singular circumstance, that when\r\ndeposited on the under side of ledges of rock or in fissures, it\r\nappears always to be of a pale, pearly grey colour, even when of\r\nconsiderable thickness: hence one is led to suppose, that an abundance\r\nof light is necessary to the development of the dark colour, in the\r\nsame manner as seems to be the case with the upper and exposed surfaces\r\nof the shells of living mollusca, which are always dark, compared with\r\ntheir under surfaces and with the parts habitually covered by the\r\nmantle of the animal. In this circumstance,—in the immediate loss of\r\ncolour and in the odour emitted under the blowpipe,—in the degree of\r\nhardness and translucency of the edges,—and in the beautiful polish of\r\nthe surface (From the fact described in my “Journal of Researches” of a\r\ncoating of oxide of iron, deposited by a streamlet on the rocks in its\r\nbed (like a nearly similar coating at the great cataracts of the\r\nOrinoco and Nile), becoming finely polished where the surf acts, I\r\npresume that the surf in this instance, also, is the polishing agent.),\r\nrivalling when in a fresh state that of the finest Oliva, there is a\r\nstriking analogy between this inorganic incrustation and the shells of\r\nliving molluscous animals. (In the section descriptive of St. Paul’s\r\nRocks, I have described a glossy, pearly substance, which coats the\r\nrocks, and an allied stalactitical incrustation from Ascension, the\r\ncrust of which resembles the enamel of teeth, but is hard enough to\r\nscratch plate-glass. Both these substances contain animal matter, and\r\nseem to have been derived from water in filtering through birds’ dung.)\r\nThis appears to me to be an interesting physiological fact. (Mr. Horner\r\nand Sir David Brewster have described “Philosophical Transactions” 1836\r\npage 65 a singular “artificial substance, resembling shell.” It is\r\ndeposited in fine, transparent, highly polished, brown- coloured\r\nlaminae, possessing peculiar optical properties, on the inside of a\r\nvessel, in which cloth, first prepared with glue and then with lime, is\r\nmade to revolve rapidly in water. It is much softer, more transparent,\r\nand contains more animal matter, than the natural incrustation at\r\nAscension; but we here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of\r\nlime and animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to\r\nshell.)\r\n\r\nSINGULAR LAMINATED BEDS ALTERNATING WITH AND PASSING INTO OBSIDIAN.\r\n\r\nThese beds occur within the trachytic district, at the western base of\r\nGreen Mountain, under which they dip at a high inclination. They are\r\nonly partially exposed, being covered up by modern ejections; from this\r\ncause, I was unable to trace their junction with the trachyte, or to\r\ndiscover whether they had flowed as a stream of lava, or had been\r\ninjected amidst the overlying strata. There are three principal beds of\r\nobsidian, of which the thickest forms the base of the section. The\r\nalternating stony layers appear to me eminently curious, and shall be\r\nfirst described, and afterwards their passage into the obsidian. They\r\nhave an extremely diversified appearance; five principal varieties may\r\nbe noticed, but these insensibly blend into each other by endless\r\ngradations.\r\n\r\nFIRST.\r\n\r\nA pale grey, irregularly and coarsely laminated (This term is open to\r\nsome misinterpretation, as it may be applied both to rocks divided into\r\nlaminae of exactly the same composition, and to layers firmly attached\r\nto each other, with no fissile tendency, but composed of different\r\nminerals, or of different shades of colour. The term “laminated,” in\r\nthis chapter, is applied in these latter senses; where a homogeneous\r\nrock splits, as in the former sense, in a given direction, like\r\nclay-slate, I have used the term “fissile.”), harsh-feeling rock,\r\nresembling clay-slate which has been in contact with a trap-dike, and\r\nwith a fracture of about the same degree of crystalline structure. This\r\nrock, as well as the following varieties, easily fuses into a pale\r\nglass. The greater part is honeycombed with irregular, angular,\r\ncavities, so that the whole has a curious appearance, and some\r\nfragments resemble in a remarkable manner silicified logs of decayed\r\nwood. This variety, especially where more compact, is often marked with\r\nthin whitish streaks, which are either straight or wrap round, one\r\nbehind the other, the elongated carious hollows.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY.\r\n\r\nA bluish grey or pale brown, compact, heavy, homogeneous stone, with an\r\nangular, uneven, earthy fracture; viewed, however, under a lens of high\r\npower, the fracture is seen to be distinctly crystalline, and even\r\nseparate minerals can be distinguished.\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY.\r\n\r\nA stone of the same kind with the last, but streaked with numerous,\r\nparallel, slightly tortuous, white lines of the thickness of hairs.\r\nThese white lines are more crystalline than the parts between them; and\r\nthe stone splits along them: they frequently expand into exceedingly\r\nthin cavities, which are often only just perceptible with a lens. The\r\nmatter forming the white lines becomes better crystallised in these\r\ncavities, and Professor Miller was fortunate enough, after several\r\ntrials, to ascertain that the white crystals, which are the largest,\r\nwere of quartz (Professor Miller informs me that the crystals which he\r\nmeasured had the faces P, z, m of the figure (147) given by Haidinger\r\nin his Translation of Mohs; and he adds, that it is remarkable, that\r\nnone of them had the slightest trace of faces r of the regular\r\nsix-sided prism.), and that the minute green transparent needles were\r\naugite, or, as they would more generally be called, diopside: besides\r\nthese crystals, there are some minute, dark specks without a trace of\r\ncrystalline, and some fine, white, granular, crystalline matter which\r\nis probably feldspar. Minute fragments of this rock are easily fusible.\r\n\r\nFOURTHLY.\r\n\r\nA compact crystalline rock, banded in straight lines with innumerable\r\nlayers of white and grey shades of colour, varying in width from the\r\nthirtieth to the two-hundredth of an inch; these layers seem to be\r\ncomposed chiefly of feldspar, and they contain numerous perfect\r\ncrystals of glassy feldspar, which are placed lengthways; they are also\r\nthickly studded with microscopically minute, amorphous, black specks,\r\nwhich are placed in rows, either standing separately, or more\r\nfrequently united, two or three or several together, into black lines,\r\nthinner than a hair. When a small fragment is heated in the blowpipe,\r\nthe black specks are easily fused into black brilliant beads, which\r\nbecome magnetic,—characters that apply to no common mineral except\r\nhornblende or augite. With the black specks there are mingled some\r\nothers of a red colour, which are magnetic before being heated, and no\r\ndoubt are oxide of iron. Round two little cavities, in a specimen of\r\nthis variety, I found the black specks aggregated into minute crystals,\r\nappearing like those of augite or hornblende, but too dull and small to\r\nbe measured by the goniometer; in the specimen, also, I could\r\ndistinguish amidst the crystalline feldspar, grains, which had the\r\naspect of quartz. By trying with a parallel ruler, I found that the\r\nthin grey layers and the black hair-like lines were absolutely straight\r\nand parallel to each other. It is impossible to trace the gradation\r\nfrom the homogeneous grey rocks to these striped varieties, or indeed\r\nthe character of the different layers in the same specimen, without\r\nfeeling convinced that the more or less perfect whiteness of the\r\ncrystalline feldspathic matter depends on the more or less perfect\r\naggregation of diffused matter, into the black and red specks of\r\nhornblende and oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nFIFTHLY.\r\n\r\nA compact heavy rock, not laminated, with an irregular, angular, highly\r\ncrystalline, fracture; it abounds with distinct crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar, and the crystalline feldspathic base is mottled with a black\r\nmineral, which on the weathered surface is seen to be aggregated into\r\nsmall crystals, some perfect, but the greater number imperfect. I\r\nshowed this specimen to an experienced geologist, and asked him what it\r\nwas; he answered, as I think every one else would have done, that it\r\nwas a primitive greenstone. The weathered surface, also, of the banded\r\nvariety in Figure 4, strikingly resembles a worn fragment of finely\r\nlaminated gneiss.\r\n\r\nThese five varieties, with many intermediate ones, pass and repass into\r\neach other. As the compact varieties are quite subordinate to the\r\nothers, the whole may be considered as laminated or striped. The\r\nlaminae, to sum up their characteristics, are either quite straight, or\r\nslightly tortuous, or convoluted; they are all parallel to each other,\r\nand to the intercalating strata of obsidian; they are generally of\r\nextreme thinness; they consist either of an apparently homogeneous,\r\ncompact rock, striped with different shades of grey and brown colours,\r\nor of crystalline feldspathic layers in a more or less perfect state of\r\npurity, and of different thicknesses, with distinct crystals of glassy\r\nfeldspar placed lengthways, or of very thin layers chiefly composed of\r\nminute crystals of quartz and augite, or composed of black and red\r\nspecks of an augitic mineral and of an oxide of iron, either not\r\ncrystallised or imperfectly so. After having fully described the\r\nobsidian, I shall return to the subject of the lamination of rocks of\r\nthe trachytic series.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the foregoing beds into the strata of glassy obsidian is\r\neffected in several ways: first, angulo-modular masses of obsidian,\r\nboth large and small, abruptly appear disseminated in a slaty, or in an\r\namorphous, pale-coloured, feldspathic rock, with a somewhat pearly\r\nfracture. Secondly, small irregular nodules of the obsidian, either\r\nstanding separately, or united into thin layers, seldom more than the\r\ntenth of an inch in thickness, alternate repeatedly with very thin\r\nlayers of a feldspathic rock, which is striped with the finest parallel\r\nzones of colour, like an agate, and which sometimes passes into the\r\nnature of pitchstone; the interstices between the nodules of obsidian\r\nare generally filled by soft white matter, resembling pumiceous ashes.\r\nThirdly, the whole substance of the bounding rock suddenly passes into\r\nan angulo-concretionary mass of obsidian. Such masses (as well as the\r\nsmall nodules) of obsidian are of a pale green colour, and are\r\ngenerally streaked with different shades of colour, parallel to the\r\nlaminae of the surrounding rock; they likewise generally contain minute\r\nwhite sphaerulites, of which half is sometimes embedded in a zone of\r\none shade of colour, and half in a zone of another shade. The obsidian\r\nassumes its jet black colour and perfectly conchoidal fracture, only\r\nwhen in large masses; but even in these, on careful examination and on\r\nholding the specimens in different lights, I could generally\r\ndistinguish parallel streaks of different shades of darkness.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 6. OPAQUE BROWN SPHAERULITES, drawn on an enlarged scale. The\r\nupper ones are externally marked with parallel ridges. The internal\r\nradiating structure of the lower ones, is much too plainly represented.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 7. A LAYER FORMED BY THE UNION OF MINUTE BROWN SPHAERULITES,\r\nINTERSECTING TWO OTHER SIMILAR LAYERS: the whole represented of nearly\r\nthe natural size.)\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest transitional rocks deserves in several respects a\r\nfurther description. It is of a very complicated nature, and consists\r\nof numerous thin, slightly tortuous layers of a pale-coloured\r\nfeldspathic stone, often passing into an imperfect pitchstone,\r\nalternating with layers formed of numberless little globules of two\r\nvarieties of obsidian, and of two kinds of sphaerulites, embedded in a\r\nsoft or in a hard pearly base. The sphaerulites are either white and\r\ntranslucent, or dark brown and opaque; the former are quite spherical,\r\nof small size, and distinctly radiated from their centre. The dark\r\nbrown sphaerulites are less perfectly round, and vary in diameter from\r\nthe twentieth to the thirtieth of an inch; when broken they exhibit\r\ntowards their centres, which are whitish, an obscure radiating\r\nstructure; two of them when united sometimes have only one central\r\npoint of radiation; there is occasionally a trace of or a hollow\r\ncrevice in their centres. They stand either separately, or are united\r\ntwo or three or many together into irregular groups, or more commonly\r\ninto layers, parallel to the stratification of the mass. This union in\r\nmany cases is so perfect, that the two sides of the layer thus formed,\r\nare quite even; and these layers, as they become less brown and opaque,\r\ncannot be distinguished from the alternating layers of the\r\npale-coloured feldspathic stone. The sphaerulites, when not united, are\r\ngenerally compressed in the plane of the lamination of the mass; and in\r\nthis same plane, they are often marked internally, by zones of\r\ndifferent shades of colour, and externally by small ridges and furrows.\r\nIn the upper part of Figure 6, the sphaerulites with the parallel\r\nridges and furrows are represented on an enlarged scale, but they are\r\nnot well executed; and in the lower part, their usual manner of\r\ngrouping is shown. In another specimen, a thin layer formed of the\r\nbrown sphaerulites closely united together, intersects, as represented\r\nin Figure 7, a layer of similar composition; and after running for a\r\nshort space in a slightly curved line, again intersects it, and\r\nlikewise a second layer lying a little way beneath that first\r\nintersected. The small nodules also of obsidian are sometimes\r\nexternally marked with ridges and furrows, parallel to the lamination\r\nof the mass, but always less plainly than the sphaerulites. These\r\nobsidian nodules are generally angular, with their edges blunted: they\r\nare often impressed with the form of the adjoining sphaerulites, than\r\nwhich they are always larger; the separate nodules seldom appear to\r\nhave drawn each other out by exerting a mutually attractive force. Had\r\nI not found in some cases, a distinct centre of attraction in these\r\nnodules of obsidian, I should have been led to have considered them as\r\nresiduary matter, left during the formation of the pearlstone, in which\r\nthey are embedded, and of the sphaerulitic globules.\r\n\r\nThe sphaerulites and the little nodules of obsidian in these rocks so\r\nclosely resemble, in general form and structure, concretions in\r\nsedimentary deposits, that one is at once tempted to attribute to them\r\nan analogous origin. They resemble ordinary concretions in the\r\nfollowing respects: in their external form,—in the union of two or\r\nthree, or of several, into an irregular mass, or into an even-sided\r\nlayer,—in the occasional intersection of one such layer by another, as\r\nin the case of chalk-flints,- -in the presence of two or three kinds of\r\nnodules, often close together, in the same basis,—in their fibrous,\r\nradiating structure, with occasional hollows in their centres,—in the\r\nco-existence of a laminary, concretionary, and radiating structure, as\r\nis so well developed in the concretions of magnesian limestone,\r\ndescribed by Professor Sedgwick. (“Geological Transactions” volume 3\r\npart 1 page 37.) Concretions in sedimentary deposits, it is known, are\r\ndue to the separation from the surrounding mass of the whole or part of\r\nsome mineral substance, and its aggregation round certain points of\r\nattraction. Guided by this fact, I have endeavoured to discover whether\r\nobsidian and the sphaerulites (to which may be added marekanite and\r\npearlstone, both of them occurring in nodular concretions in the\r\ntrachytic series) differ in their constituent parts, from the minerals\r\ngenerally composing trachytic rocks. It appears from three analyses,\r\nthat obsidian contains on an average 76 per cent of silica; from one\r\nanalysis, that sphaerulites contain 79.12; from two, that marekanite\r\ncontains 79.25; and from two other analyses, that pearlstone contains\r\n75.62 of silica. (The foregoing analyses are taken from Beudant “Traite\r\nde Mineralogie” tome 2 page 113; and one analysis of obsidian from\r\nPhillips “Mineralogy.”) Now, the constituent parts of trachyte, as far\r\nas they can be distinguished consist of feldspar, containing 65.21 of\r\nsilica; or of albite, containing 69.09; of hornblende, containing 55.27\r\n(These analyses are taken from Von Kobell “Grundzuge der Mineralogie”\r\n1838.), and of oxide of iron: so that the foregoing glassy\r\nconcretionary substances all contain a larger proportion of silica than\r\nthat occurring in ordinary feldspathic or trachytic rocks. D’Aubuisson\r\n(“Traite de Geogn.” tome 2 page 535.), also, has remarked on the large\r\nproportion of silica compared with alumina, in six analyses of obsidian\r\nand pearlstone given in Brongniart’s “Mineralogy.” Hence I conclude,\r\nthat the foregoing concretions have been formed by a process of\r\naggregation, strictly analogous to that which takes place in aqueous\r\ndeposits, acting chiefly on the silica, but likewise on some of the\r\nother elements of the surrounding mass, and thus producing the\r\ndifferent concretionary varieties. From the well-known effects of rapid\r\ncooling (This is seen in the manufacture of common glass, and in\r\nGregory Watts’s experiments on molten trap; also on the natural\r\nsurfaces of lava- streams, and on the side-walls of dikes.) in giving\r\nglassiness of texture, it is probably necessary that the entire mass,\r\nin cases like that of Ascension, should have cooled at a certain rate;\r\nbut considering the repeated and complicated alterations of nodules and\r\nthin layers of a glassy texture with other layers quite stony or\r\ncrystalline, all within the space of a few feet or even inches, it is\r\nhardly possible that they could have cooled at different rates, and\r\nthus have acquired their different textures.\r\n\r\nThe natural sphaerulites in these rocks very closely resemble those\r\nproduced in glass, when slowly cooled. (I do not know whether it is\r\ngenerally known, that bodies having exactly the same appearance as\r\nsphaerulites, sometimes occur in agates. Mr. Robert Brown showed me in\r\nan agate, formed within a cavity in a piece of silicified wood, some\r\nlittle specks, which were only just visible to the naked eye: these\r\nspecks, when placed by him under a lens of high power, presented a\r\nbeautiful appearance: they were perfectly circular, and consisted of\r\nthe finest fibres of a brown colour, radiating with great exactness\r\nfrom a common centre. These little radiating stars are occasionally\r\nintersected, and portions are quite cut off by the fine, ribbon-like\r\nzones of colour in the agate. In the obsidian of Ascension, the halves\r\nof a sphaerulite often lie in different zones of colour, but they are\r\nnot cut off by them, as in the agate.) In some fine specimens of\r\npartially devitrified glass, in the possession of Mr. Stokes, the\r\nsphaerulites are united into straight layers with even sides, parallel\r\nto each other, and to one of the outer surfaces, exactly as in the\r\nobsidian. These layers sometimes interbranch and form loops; but I did\r\nnot see any case of actual intersection. They form the passage from the\r\nperfectly glassy portions, to those nearly homogeneous and stony, with\r\nonly an obscure concretionary structure. In the same specimen, also,\r\nsphaerulites differing slightly in colour and in structure, occur\r\nembedded close together. Considering these facts, it is some\r\nconfirmation of the view above given of the concretionary origin of the\r\nobsidian and natural sphaerulites, to find that M. Dartigues (“Journal\r\nde Physique” tome 59 1804 pages 10, 12.), in his curious paper on this\r\nsubject, attributes the production of sphaerulites in glass, to the\r\ndifferent ingredients obeying their own laws of attraction and becoming\r\naggregated. He is led to believe that this takes place, from the\r\ndifficulty in remelting sphaerulitic glass, without the whole be first\r\nthoroughly pounded and mixed together; and likewise from the fact, that\r\nthe change takes place most readily in glass composed of many\r\ningredients. In confirmation of M. Dartigues’ view, I may remark, that\r\nM. Fleuriau de Bellevue (Idem tome 60 1805 page 418.) found that the\r\nsphaerulitic portions of devitrified glass were acted on both by nitric\r\nacid and under the blowpipe, in a different manner from the compact\r\npaste in which they were embedded.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THE OBSIDIAN BEDS AND ALTERNATING STRATA OF ASCENSION,\r\nWITH THOSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\nI have been struck with much surprise, how closely the excellent\r\ndescription of the obsidian rocks of Hungary, given by Beudant (“Voyage\r\nen Hongrie” tome 1 page 330; tome 2 pages 221 and 315; tome 3 pages\r\n369, 371, 377, 381.), and that by Humboldt, of the same formation in\r\nMexico and Peru (“Essai Geognostique” pages 176, 326, 328.), and\r\nlikewise the descriptions given by several authors (P. Scrope\r\n“Geological Transactions” volume 2 second series page 195. Consult also\r\nDolomieu “Voyage aux Isles Lipari” and D’Aubuisson “Traite de Geogn.”\r\ntome 2 page 534.) of the trachytic regions in the Italian islands,\r\nagree with my observations at Ascension. Many passages might have been\r\ntransferred without alteration from the works of the above authors, and\r\nwould have been applicable to this island. They all agree in the\r\nlaminated and stratified character of the whole series; and Humboldt\r\nspeaks of some of the beds of obsidian being ribboned like jasper. (In\r\nMr. Stokes’ fine collection of obsidians from Mexico, I observe that\r\nthe sphaerulites are generally much larger than those of Ascension;\r\nthey are generally white, opaque, and are united into distinct layers:\r\nthere are many singular varieties, different from any at Ascension. The\r\nobsidians are finely zoned, in quite straight or curved lines, with\r\nexceedingly slight differences of tint, of cellularity, and of more or\r\nless perfect degrees of glassiness. Tracing some of the less perfectly\r\nglassy zones, they are seen to become studded with minute white\r\nsphaerulites, which become more and more numerous, until at last they\r\nunite and form a distinct layer: on the other hand, at Ascension, only\r\nthe brown sphaerulites unite and form layers; the white ones always\r\nbeing irregularly disseminated. Some specimens at the Geological\r\nSociety, said to belong to an obsidian formation from Mexico, have an\r\nearthy fracture, and are divided in the finest parallel laminae, by\r\nspecks of a black mineral, like the augitic or hornblendic specks in\r\nthe rocks at Ascension.) They all agree in the nodular or concretionary\r\ncharacter of the obsidian, and of the passage of these nodules into\r\nlayers. They all refer to the repeated alterations, often in undulatory\r\nplanes, of glassy, pearly, stony, and crystalline layers: the\r\ncrystalline layers, however, seem to be much more perfectly developed\r\nat Ascension, than in the above-named countries. Humboldt compares some\r\nof the stony beds, when viewed from a distance, to strata of a\r\nschistose sandstone. Sphaerulites are described as occurring abundantly\r\nin all cases; and they everywhere seem to mark the passage, from the\r\nperfectly glassy to the stony and crystalline beds. Beudant’s account\r\n(Beudant “Voyage” tome 3 page 373.) of his “perlite lithoide\r\nglobulaire” in every, even the most trifling particular, might have\r\nbeen written for the little brown sphaerulitic globules of the rocks of\r\nAscension.\r\n\r\nFrom the close similarity in so many respects, between the obsidian\r\nformations of Hungary, Mexico, Peru, and of some of the Italian\r\nislands, with that of Ascension, I can hardly doubt that in all these\r\ncases, the obsidian and the sphaerulites owe their origin to a\r\nconcretionary aggregation of the silica, and of some of the other\r\nconstituent elements, taking place whilst the liquified mass cooled at\r\na certain required rate. It is, however, well-known, that in several\r\nplaces, obsidian has flowed in streams like lava; for instance, at\r\nTeneriffe, at the Lipari Islands, and at Iceland. (For Teneriffe see\r\nvon Buch “Descript. des Isles Canaries” pages 184 and 190; for the\r\nLipari Islands see Dolomieu “Voyage” page 34; for Iceland see Mackenzie\r\n“Travels” page 369.) In these cases, the superficial parts are the most\r\nperfectly glassy, the obsidian passing at the depth of a few feet into\r\nan opaque stone. In an analysis by Vauquelin of a specimen of obsidian\r\nfrom Hecla, which probably flowed as lava, the proportion of silica is\r\nnearly the same as in the nodular or concretionary obsidian from\r\nMexico. It would be interesting to ascertain, whether the opaque\r\ninterior portions and the superficial glassy coating contained the same\r\nproportional constituent parts: we know from M. Dufrenoy (“Memoires\r\npour servir a une Descript. Geolog. de la France” tome 4 page 371.)\r\nthat the exterior and interior parts of the same stream of lava\r\nsometimes differ considerably in their composition. Even should the\r\nwhole body of the stream of obsidian turn out to be similarly composed\r\nwith nodular obsidian, it would only be necessary, in accordance with\r\nthe foregoing facts, to suppose that lava in these instances had been\r\nerupted with its ingredients mixed in the same proportion, as in the\r\nconcretionary obsidian.\r\n\r\nLAMINATION OF VOLCANIC ROCKS OF THE TRACHYTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, in several and widely distant countries, the strata\r\nalternating with beds of obsidian, are highly laminated. The nodules,\r\nalso, both large and small, of the obsidian, are zoned with different\r\nshades of colour; and I have seen a specimen from Mexico in Mr. Stokes’\r\ncollection, with its external surface weathered (MacCulloch states\r\n“Classification of Rocks” page 531 that the exposed surfaces of the\r\npitchstone dikes in Arran are furrowed “with undulating lines,\r\nresembling certain varieties of marbled paper, and which evidently\r\nresult from some corresponding difference of laminar structure.”) into\r\nridges and furrows, corresponding with the zones of different degrees\r\nof glassiness: Humboldt (“Personal Narrative” volume 1 page 222.),\r\nmoreover, found on the Peak of Teneriffe, a stream of obsidian divided\r\nby very thin, alternating, layers of pumice. Many other lavas of the\r\nfeldspathic series are laminated; thus, masses of common trachyte at\r\nAscension are divided by fine earthy lines, along which the rock\r\nsplits, separating thin layers of slightly different shades of colour;\r\nthe greater number, also, of the embedded crystals of glassy feldspar\r\nare placed lengthways in the same direction. Mr. P. Scrope (“Geological\r\nTransactions” volume 2 second series page 195.) has described a\r\nremarkable columnar trachyte in the Panza Islands, which seems to have\r\nbeen injected into an overlying mass of trachytic conglomerate: it is\r\nstriped with zones, often of extreme tenuity, of different textures and\r\ncolours; the harder and darker zones appearing to contain a larger\r\nproportion of silica. In another part of the island, there are layers\r\nof pearlstone and pitchstone, which in many respects resemble those of\r\nAscension. The zones in the columnar trachyte are generally contorted;\r\nthey extend uninterruptedly for a great length in a vertical direction,\r\nand apparently parallel to the walls of the dike-like mass. Von Buch\r\n(“Description des Iles Canaries” page 184.) has described at Teneriffe,\r\na stream of lava containing innumerable thin, plate-like crystals of\r\nfeldspar, which are arranged like white threads, one behind the other,\r\nand which mostly follow the same direction. Dolomieu (“Voyage aux Isles\r\nde Lipari” pages 35 and 85.) also states, that the grey lavas of the\r\nmodern cone of Vulcano, which have a vitreous texture, are streaked\r\nwith parallel white lines: he further describes a solid pumice-stone\r\nwhich possesses a fissile structure, like that of certain micaceous\r\nschists. Phonolite, which I may observe is often, if not always, an\r\ninjected rock, also, often has a fissile structure; this is generally\r\ndue to the parallel position of the embedded crystals of feldspar, but\r\nsometimes, as at Fernando Noronha, seems to be nearly independent of\r\ntheir presence. (In this case, and in that of the fissile pumice-stone,\r\nthe structure is very different from that in the foregoing cases, where\r\nthe laminae consist of alternate layers of different composition or\r\ntexture. In some sedimentary formations, however, which apparently are\r\nhomogeneous and fissile, as in glossy clay-slate, there is reason to\r\nbelieve, according to D’Aubuisson, that the laminae are really due to\r\nexcessively thin, alternating, layers of mica.) From these facts we\r\nsee, that various rocks of the feldspathic series have either a\r\nlaminated or fissile structure, and that it occurs both in masses which\r\nhave injected into overlying strata, and in others which have flowed as\r\nstreams of lava.\r\n\r\nThe laminae of the beds, alternating with the obsidian at Ascension,\r\ndip at a high angle under the mountain, at the base of which they are\r\nsituated; and they do not appear as if they had been inclined by\r\nviolence. A high inclination is common to these beds in Mexico, Peru,\r\nand in some of the Italian islands (See Phillips “Mineralogy” for the\r\nItalian Islands page 136. For Mexico and Peru see Humboldt “Essai\r\nGeognostique.” Mr. Edwards also describes the high inclination of the\r\nobsidian rocks of the Cerro del Navaja in Mexico in the “Proc. of the\r\nGeolog. Soc.” June 1838.): on the other hand, in Hungary, the layers\r\nare horizontal; the laminae, also, of some of the lava-streams above\r\nreferred to, as far as I can understand the descriptions given of them,\r\nappear to be highly inclined or vertical. I doubt whether in any of\r\nthese cases, the laminae have been tilted into their present position;\r\nand in some instances, as in that of the trachyte described by Mr.\r\nScrope, it is almost certain that they have been originally formed with\r\na high inclination. In many of these cases, there is evidence that the\r\nmass of liquified rock has moved in the direction of the laminae. At\r\nAscension, many of the air-cells have a drawn out appearance, and are\r\ncrossed by coarse semi-glassy fibres, in the direction of the laminae;\r\nand some of the layers, separating the sphaerulitic globules, have a\r\nscored appearance, as if produced by the grating of the globules. I\r\nhave seen a specimen of zoned obsidian from Mexico, in Mr. Stokes’\r\ncollection, with the surfaces of the best-defined layers streaked or\r\nfurrowed with parallel lines; and these lines or streaks precisely\r\nresembled those, produced on the surface of a mass of artificial glass\r\nby its having been poured out of a vessel. Humboldt, also, has\r\ndescribed little cavities, which he compares to the tails of comets,\r\nbehind sphaerulites in laminated obsidian rocks from Mexico, and Mr.\r\nScrope has described other cavities behind fragments embedded in his\r\nlaminated trachyte, and which he supposes to have been produced during\r\nthe movement of the mass. (“Geological Transactions” volume 2 second\r\nseries page 200 etc. These embedded fragments, in some instances,\r\nconsist of the laminated trachyte broken off and “enveloped in those\r\nparts, which still remained liquid.” Beudant, also, frequently refers\r\nin his great work on “Hungary” tome 3 page 386, to trachytic rocks,\r\nirregularly spotted with fragments of the same varieties, which in\r\nother parts form the parallel ribbons. In these cases, we must suppose,\r\nthat after part of the molten mass had assumed a laminated structure, a\r\nfresh irruption of lava broke up the mass, and involved fragments, and\r\nthat subsequently the whole became relaminated.) From such facts, most\r\nauthors have attributed the lamination of these volcanic rocks to their\r\nmovement whilst liquified. Although it is easy to perceive, why each\r\nseparate air-cell, or each fibre in pumice-stone (Dolomieu “Voyage”\r\npage 64.), should be drawn out in the direction of the moving mass; it\r\nis by no means at first obvious why such air-cells and fibres should be\r\narranged by the movement, in the same planes, in laminae absolutely\r\nstraight and parallel to each other, and often of extreme tenuity; and\r\nstill less obvious is it, why such layers should come to be of slightly\r\ndifferent composition and of different textures.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to make out the cause of the lamination of these\r\nigneous feldspathic rocks, let us return to the facts so minutely\r\ndescribed at Ascension. We there see, that some of the thinnest layers\r\nare chiefly formed by numerous, exceedingly minute, though perfect,\r\ncrystals of different minerals; that other layers are formed by the\r\nunion of different kinds of concretionary globules, and that the layers\r\nthus formed, often cannot be distinguished from the ordinary\r\nfeldspathic and pitchstone layers, composing a large portion of the\r\nentire mass. The fibrous radiating structure of the sphaerulites seems,\r\njudging from many analogous cases, to connect the concretionary and\r\ncrystalline forces: the separate crystals, also, of feldspar all lie in\r\nthe same parallel planes. (The formation, indeed, of a large crystal of\r\nany mineral in a rock of mixed composition implies an aggregation of\r\nthe requisite atoms, allied to concretionary action. The cause of the\r\ncrystals of feldspar in these rocks of Ascension, being all placed\r\nlengthways, is probably the same with that which elongates and flattens\r\nall the brown sphaerulitic globules (which behave like feldspar under\r\nthe blowpipe) in this same direction.) These allied forces, therefore,\r\nhave played an important part in the lamination of the mass, but they\r\ncannot be considered the primary force; for the several kinds of\r\nnodules, both the smallest and largest, are internally zoned with\r\nexcessively fine shades of colour, parallel to the lamination of the\r\nwhole; and many of them are, also, externally marked in the same\r\ndirection with parallel ridges and furrows, which have not been\r\nproduced by weathering.\r\n\r\nSome of the finest streaks of colour in the stony layers, alternating\r\nwith the obsidian, can be distinctly seen to be due to an incipient\r\ncrystallisation of the constituent minerals. The extent to which the\r\nminerals have crystallised can, also, be distinctly seen to be\r\nconnected with the greater or less size, and with the number, of the\r\nminute, flattened, crenulated air-cavities or fissures. Numerous facts,\r\nas in the case of geodes, and of cavities in silicified wood, in\r\nprimary rocks, and in veins, show that crystallisation is much favoured\r\nby space. Hence, I conclude, that, if in a mass of cooling volcanic\r\nrock, any cause produced in parallel planes a number of minute fissures\r\nor zones of less tension (which from the pent-up vapours would often be\r\nexpanded into crenulated air-cavities), the crystallisation of the\r\nconstituent parts, and probably the formation of concretions, would be\r\nsuperinduced or much favoured in such planes; and thus, a laminated\r\nstructure of the kind we are here considering would be generated.\r\n\r\nThat some cause does produce parallel zones of less tension in volcanic\r\nrocks, during their consolidation, we must admit in the case of the\r\nthin alternate layers of obsidian and pumice described by Humboldt, and\r\nof the small, flattened, crenulated air-cells in the laminated rocks of\r\nAscension; for on no other principle can we conceive why the confined\r\nvapours should through their expansion form air-cells or fibres in\r\nseparate, parallel planes, instead of irregularly throughout the mass.\r\nIn Mr. Stokes’ collection, I have seen a beautiful example of this\r\nstructure, in a specimen of obsidian from Mexico, which is shaded and\r\nzoned, like the finest agate, with numerous, straight, parallel layers,\r\nmore or less opaque and white, or almost perfectly glassy; the degree\r\nof opacity and glassiness depending on the number of microscopically\r\nminute, flattened air-cells; in this case, it is scarcely possible to\r\ndoubt but that the mass, to which the fragment belonged, must have been\r\nsubjected to some, probably prolonged, action, causing the tension\r\nslightly to vary in the successive planes.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes appear capable of producing zones of different tension,\r\nin masses semi-liquified by heat. In a fragment of devitrified glass, I\r\nhave observed layers of sphaerulites which appeared, from the manner in\r\nwhich they were abruptly bent, to have been produced by the simple\r\ncontraction of the mass in the vessel, in which it cooled. In certain\r\ndikes on Mount Etna, described by M. Elie de Beaumont (“Mem. pour\r\nservir” etc. tome 4 page 131.), as bordered by alternating bands of\r\nscoriaceous and compact rock, one is led to suppose that the stretching\r\nmovement of the surrounding strata, which originally produced the\r\nfissures, continued whilst the injected rock remained fluid. Guided,\r\nhowever, by Professor Forbes’ (“Edinburgh New Phil. Journal” 1842 page\r\n350.) clear description of the zoned structure of glacier-ice, far the\r\nmost probable explanation of the laminated structure of these\r\nfeldspathic rocks appears to be, that they have been stretched whilst\r\nslowly flowing onwards in a pasty condition (I presume that this is\r\nnearly the same explanation which Mr. Scrope had in his mind, when he\r\nspeaks (“Geolog. Transact.” volume 2 second series page 228) of the\r\nribboned structure of his trachytic rocks, having arisen, from “a\r\nlinear extension of the mass, while in a state of imperfect liquidity,\r\ncoupled with a concretionary process.”), in precisely the same manner\r\nas Professor Forbes believes, that the ice of moving glaciers is\r\nstretched and fissured. In both cases, the zones may be compared to\r\nthose in the finest agates; in both, they extend in the direction in\r\nwhich the mass has flowed, and those exposed on the surface are\r\ngenerally vertical: in the ice, the porous laminae are rendered\r\ndistinct by the subsequent congelation of infiltrated water, in the\r\nstony feldspathic lavas, by subsequent crystalline and concretionary\r\naction. The fragment of glassy obsidian in Mr. Stokes’ collection,\r\nwhich is zoned with minute air-cells must strikingly resemble, judging\r\nfrom Professor Forbes’ descriptions, a fragment of the zoned ice; and\r\nif the rate of cooling and nature of the mass had been favourable to\r\nits crystallisation or to concretionary action, we should here have had\r\nthe finest parallel zones of different composition and texture. In\r\nglaciers, the lines of porous ice and of minute crevices seem to be due\r\nto an incipient stretching, caused by the central parts of the frozen\r\nstream moving faster than the sides and bottom, which are retarded by\r\nfriction: hence in glaciers of certain forms and towards the lower end\r\nof most glaciers, the zones become horizontal. May we venture to\r\nsuppose that in the feldspathic lavas with horizontal laminae, we see\r\nan analogous case? All geologists, who have examined trachytic regions,\r\nhave come to the conclusion, that the lavas of this series have\r\npossessed an exceedingly imperfect fluidity; and as it is evident that\r\nonly matter thus characterised would be subject to become fissured and\r\nto be formed into zones of different tensions, in the manner here\r\nsupposed, we probably see the reason why augitic lavas, which appear\r\ngenerally to have possessed a high degree of fluidity, are not, like\r\nthe feldspathic lavas, divided into laminae of different composition\r\nand texture. (Basaltic lavas, and many other rocks, are not\r\nunfrequently divided into thick laminae or plates, of the same\r\ncomposition, which are either straight or curved; these being crossed\r\nby vertical lines of fissure, sometimes become united into columns.\r\nThis structure seems related, in its origin, to that by which many\r\nrocks, both igneous and sedimentary, become traversed by parallel\r\nsystems of fissures.) Moreover, in the augitic series, there never\r\nappears to be any tendency to concretionary action, which we have seen\r\nplays an important part in the lamination of rocks, of the trachytic\r\nseries, or at least in rendering that structure apparent.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the explanation here advanced of the\r\nlaminated structure of the rocks of the trachytic series, I venture to\r\ncall the attention of geologists to the simple fact, that in a body of\r\nrock at Ascension, undoubtedly of volcanic origin, layers often of\r\nextreme tenuity, quite straight, and parallel to each other, have been\r\nproduced;—some composed of distinct crystals of quartz and diopside,\r\nmingled with amorphous augitic specks and granular feldspar,—others\r\nentirely composed of these black augitic specks, with granules of oxide\r\nof iron,—and lastly, others formed of crystalline feldspar, in a more\r\nor less perfect state of purity, together with numerous crystals of\r\nfeldspar, placed lengthways. At this island, there is reason to\r\nbelieve, and in some analogous cases, it is certainly known, that the\r\nlaminae have originally been formed with their present high\r\ninclination. Facts of this nature are manifestly of importance, with\r\nrelation to the structural origin of that grand series of plutonic\r\nrocks, which like the volcanic have undergone the action of heat, and\r\nwhich consist of alternate layers of quartz, feldspar, mica and other\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nST.

Elevation of the land.\r\nDenudation. Craters of elevation.\r\n\r\nThe whole island is of volcanic origin; its circumference, according to\r\nBeatson, is about twenty-eight miles. (Governor Beatson “Account of St.\r\nHelena.”) The central and largest part consists of rocks of a\r\nfeldspathic nature, generally decomposed to an extraordinary degree;\r\nand when in this state, presenting a singular assemblage of\r\nalternating, red, purple, brown, yellow, and white, soft, argillaceous\r\nbeds. From the shortness of our visit, I did not examine these beds\r\nwith care; some of them, especially those of the white, yellow, and\r\nbrown shades, originally existed as streams of lava, but the greater\r\nnumber were probably ejected in the form of scoriae and ashes: other\r\nbeds of a purple tint, porphyritic with crystal- shaped patches of a\r\nwhite, soft substance, which are now unctuous, and yield, like wax, a\r\npolished streak to the nail, seem once to have existed as solid\r\nclaystone-porphyries: the red argillaceous beds generally have a\r\nbrecciated structure, and no doubt have been formed by the\r\ndecomposition of scoriae. Several extensive streams, however, belonging\r\nto this series, retain their stony character; these are either of a\r\nblackish-green colour, with minute acicular crystals of feldspar, or of\r\na very pale tint, and almost composed of minute, often scaly, crystals\r\nof feldspar, abounding with microscopical black specks; they are\r\ngenerally compact and laminated; others, however, of similar\r\ncomposition, are cellular and somewhat decomposed. None of these rocks\r\ncontain large crystals of feldspar, or have the harsh fracture peculiar\r\nto trachyte. These feldspathic lavas and tuffs are the uppermost or\r\nthose last erupted; innumerable dikes, however, and great masses of\r\nmolten rock, have subsequently been injected into them. They converge,\r\nas they rise, towards the central curved ridge, of which one point\r\nattains the elevation of 2,700 feet. This ridge is the highest land in\r\nthe island; and it once formed the northern rim of a great crater,\r\nwhence the lavas of this series flowed: from its ruined condition, from\r\nthe southern half having been removed, and from the violent dislocation\r\nwhich the whole island has undergone, its structure is rendered very\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\nBASALTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nThe margin of the island is formed by a rude circle of great, black,\r\nstratified, ramparts of basalt, dipping seaward, and worn into cliffs,\r\nwhich are often nearly perpendicular, and vary in height from a few\r\nhundred feet to two thousand. This circle, or rather horse-shoe shaped\r\nring, is open to the south, and is breached by several other wide\r\nspaces. Its rim or summit generally projects little above the level of\r\nthe adjoining inland country; and the more recent feldspathic lavas,\r\nsloping down from the central heights, generally abut against and\r\noverlap its inner margin; on the north-western side of the island,\r\nhowever, they appear (judging from a distance) to have flowed over and\r\nconcealed portions of it. In some parts, where the basaltic ring has\r\nbeen breached, and the black ramparts stand detached, the feldspathic\r\nlavas have passed between them, and now overhang the sea-coast in lofty\r\ncliffs. The basaltic rocks are of a black colour and thinly stratified;\r\nthey are generally highly vesicular, but occasionally compact; some of\r\nthem contain numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and octahedrons of\r\ntitaniferous iron; others abound with crystals of augite and grains of\r\nolivine. The vesicles are frequently lined with minute crystals (of\r\nchabasie?) and even become amygdaloidal with them. The streams are\r\nseparated from each other by cindery matter, or by a bright red,\r\nfriable, saliferous tuff, which is marked by successive lines like\r\nthose of aqueous deposition; and sometimes it has an obscure,\r\nconcretionary structure. The rocks of this basaltic series occur\r\nnowhere except near the coast. In most volcanic districts the trachytic\r\nlavas are of anterior origin to the basaltic; but here we see, that a\r\ngreat pile of rock, closely related in composition to the trachytic\r\nfamily, has been erupted subsequently to the basaltic strata: the\r\nnumber, however, of dikes, abounding with large crystals of augite,\r\nwith which the feldspathic lavas have been injected, shows perhaps some\r\ntendency to a return to the more usual order of superposition.\r\n\r\nBASAL SUBMARINE LAVAS.\r\n\r\nThe lavas of this basal series lie immediately beneath both the\r\nbasaltic and feldspathic rocks. According to Mr. Seale, they may be\r\nseen at intervals on the sea-beach round the entire island. (“Geognosy\r\nof the Island of St. Helena.” Mr. Seale has constructed a gigantic\r\nmodel of St. Helena, well worth visiting, which is now deposited at\r\nAddiscombe College, in Surrey.) In the sections which I examined, their\r\nnature varied much; some of the strata abound with crystals of augite;\r\nothers are of a brown colour, either laminated or in a rubbly\r\ncondition; and many parts are highly amygdaloidal with calcareous\r\nmatter. The successive sheets are either closely united together, or\r\nare separated from each other by beds of scoriaceous rock and of\r\nlaminated tuff, frequently containing well-rounded fragments. The\r\ninterstices of these beds are filled with gypsum and salt; the gypsum\r\nalso sometimes occurring in thin layers. From the large quantity of\r\nthese two substances, from the presence of rounded pebbles in the\r\ntuffs, and from the abundant amygdaloids, I cannot doubt that these\r\nbasal volcanic strata flowed beneath the sea. This remark ought perhaps\r\nto be extended to a part of the superincumbent basaltic rocks; but on\r\nthis point, I was not able to obtain clear evidence. The strata of the\r\nbasal series, whenever I examined them, were intersected by an\r\nextraordinary number of dikes.\r\n\r\nFLAGSTAFF HILL AND THE BARN.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 8. FLAGSTAFF HILL AND THE BARN. (Section West (left) to East\r\n(right)) Flagstaff Hill, 2,272 feet high to The Barn, 2,015 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe double lines represent the basaltic strata; the single, the basal\r\nsubmarine strata; the dotted, the upper feldspathic strata; the dikes\r\nare shaded transversely.)\r\n\r\nI will now describe some of the more remarkable sections, and will\r\ncommence with these two hills, which form the principal external\r\nfeature on the north-eastern side of the island. The square, angular\r\noutline, and black colour of the Barn, at once show that it belongs to\r\nthe basaltic series; whilst the smooth, conical figure, and the varied\r\nbright tints of Flagstaff Hill, render it equally clear, that it is\r\ncomposed of the softened, feldspathic rocks. These two lofty hills are\r\nconnected (as is shown in Figure 8) by a sharp ridge, which is composed\r\nof the rubbly lavas of the basal series. The strata of this ridge dip\r\nwestward, the inclination becoming less and less towards the Flagstaff;\r\nand the upper feldspathic strata of this hill can be seen, though with\r\nsome difficulty, to dip conformably to the W.S.W. Close to the Barn,\r\nthe strata of the ridge are nearly vertical, but are much obscured by\r\ninnumerable dikes; under this hill, they probably change from being\r\nvertical into being inclined into an opposite direction; for the upper\r\nor basaltic strata, which are about eight hundred or one thousand feet\r\nin thickness, are inclined north-eastward, at an angle between thirty\r\nand forty degrees.\r\n\r\nThis ridge, and likewise the Barn and Flagstaff Hills, are interlaced\r\nby dikes, many of which preserve a remarkable parallelism in a N.N.W.\r\nand S.S.E. direction. The dikes chiefly consist of a rock, porphyritic\r\nwith large crystals of augite; others are formed of a fine-grained and\r\nbrown- coloured trap. Most of these dikes are coated by a glossy layer,\r\nfrom one to two-tenths of an inch in thickness, which, unlike true\r\npitchstone, fuses into a black enamel; this layer is evidently\r\nanalogous to the glossy superficial coating of many lava streams. (This\r\ncircumstance has been observed (Lyell “Principles of Geology” volume 4\r\nchapter 10 page 9) in the dikes of the Atrio del Cavallo, but\r\napparently it is not of very common occurrence. Sir G. Mackenzie,\r\nhowever, states (page 372 “Travels in Iceland”) that all the veins in\r\nIceland have a “black vitreous coating on their sides.” Captain\r\nCarmichael, speaking of the dikes in Tristan d’Acunha, a volcanic\r\nisland in the Southern Atlantic, says (“Linnaean Transactions” volume\r\n12 page 485) that their sides, “where they come in contact with the\r\nrocks, are invariably in a semi-vitrified state.”) The dikes can often\r\nbe followed for great lengths both horizontally and vertically, and\r\nthey seem to preserve a nearly uniform thickness (“Geognosy of the\r\nIsland of St. Helena” plate 5.): Mr. Seale states, that one near the\r\nBarn, in a height of 1,260 feet, decreases in width only four\r\ninches,—from nine feet at the bottom, to eight feet and eight inches at\r\nthe top. On the ridge, the dikes appear to have been guided in their\r\ncourse, to a considerable degree, by the alternating soft and hard\r\nstrata: they are often firmly united to the harder strata, and they\r\npreserve their parallelism for such great lengths, that in very many\r\ninstances it was impossible to conjecture, which of the beds were\r\ndikes, and which streams of lava. The dikes, though so numerous on this\r\nridge, are even more numerous in the valleys a little south of it, and\r\nto a degree I never saw equalled anywhere else: in these valleys they\r\nextend in less regular lines, covering the ground with a network, like\r\na spider’s web, and with some parts of the surface even appearing to\r\nconsist wholly of dikes, interlaced by other dikes.\r\n\r\nFrom the complexity produced by the dikes, from the high inclination\r\nand anticlinal dip of the strata of the basal series, which are\r\noverlaid, at the opposite ends of the short ridge, by two great masses\r\nof different ages and of different composition, I am not surprised that\r\nthis singular section has been misunderstood. It has even been supposed\r\nto form part of a crater; but so far is this from having been the case,\r\nthat the summit of Flagstaff Hill once formed the lower extremity of a\r\nsheet of lava and ashes, which were erupted from the central,\r\ncrateriform ridge. Judging from the slope of the contemporaneous\r\nstreams in an adjoining and undisturbed part of the island, the strata\r\nof the Flagstaff Hill must have been upturned at least twelve hundred\r\nfeet, and probably much more, for the great truncated dikes on its\r\nsummit show that it has been largely denuded. The summit of this hill\r\nnow nearly equals in height the crateriform ridge; and before having\r\nbeen denuded, it was probably higher than this ridge, from which it is\r\nseparated by a broad and much lower tract of country; we here,\r\ntherefore, see that the lower extremities of a set of lava-streams have\r\nbeen tilted up to as great a height as, or perhaps greater height than,\r\nthe crater, down the flanks of which they originally flowed. I believe\r\nthat dislocations on so grand a scale are extremely rare in volcanic\r\ndistricts. (M. Constant Prevost “Mem. de la Soc. Geolog.” tome 2\r\nobserves that “les produits volcaniques n’ont que localement et\r\nrarement meme derange le sol, a travers lequel ils se sont fait jour.”)\r\nThe formation of such numbers of dikes in this part of the island shows\r\nthat the surface must here have been stretched to a quite extraordinary\r\ndegree: this stretching, on the ridge between Flagstaff and Barn Hills,\r\nprobably took place subsequently (though perhaps immediately so) to the\r\nstrata being tilted; for had the strata at that time extended\r\nhorizontally, they would in all probability have been fissured and\r\ninjected transversely, instead of in the planes of their\r\nstratification. Although the space between the Barn and Flagstaff Hill\r\npresents a distinct anticlinal line extending north and south, and\r\nthough most of the dikes range with much regularity in the same line,\r\nnevertheless, at only a mile due south of the ridge the strata lie\r\nundisturbed. Hence the disturbing force seems to have acted under a\r\npoint, rather than along a line. The manner in which it has acted, is\r\nprobably explained by the structure of Little Stony-top, a mountain\r\n2,000 feet high, situated a few miles southward of the Barn; we there\r\nsee, even from a distance, a dark-coloured, sharp, wedge of compact\r\ncolumnar rock, with the bright-coloured feldspathic strata, sloping\r\naway on each side from its uncovered apex. This wedge, from which it\r\nderives its name of Stony-top, consists of a body of rock, which has\r\nbeen injected whilst liquified into the overlying strata; and if we may\r\nsuppose that a similar body of rock lies injected, beneath the ridge\r\nconnecting the Barn and Flagstaff, the structure there exhibited would\r\nbe explained.\r\n\r\nTURK’S CAP AND PROSPEROUS BAYS.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 9. PROSPEROUS HILL AND THE BARN. (Section S.S.E. (left) to\r\nN.N.W. (right) Prosperous Hill through Hold-fast-Tom and Flagstaff Hill\r\nto The Barn.\r\n\r\nThe double lines represent the basaltic strata; the single, the basal\r\nsubmarine strata; the dotted, the upper feldspathic strata.)\r\n\r\nProsperous Hill is a great, black, precipitous mountain, situated two\r\nmiles and a half south of the Barn, and composed, like it, of basaltic\r\nstrata. These rest, in one part, on the brown-coloured, porphyritic\r\nbeds of the basal series, and in another part, on a fissured mass of\r\nhighly scoriaceous and amygdaloidal rock, which seems to have formed a\r\nsmall point of eruption beneath the sea, contemporaneously with the\r\nbasal series. Prosperous Hill, like the Barn, is traversed by many\r\ndikes, of which the greater number range north and south, and its\r\nstrata dip, at an angle of about 20 degrees, rather obliquely from the\r\nisland towards the sea. The space between Prosperous Hill and the Barn,\r\nas represented in Figure 9, consists of lofty cliffs, composed of the\r\nlavas of the upper or feldspathic series, which rest, though\r\nunconformably, on the basal submarine strata, as we have seen that they\r\ndo at Flagstaff Hill. Differently, however, from in that hill, these\r\nupper strata are nearly horizontal, gently rising towards the interior\r\nof the island; and they are composed of greenish-black, or more\r\ncommonly, pale brown, compact lavas, instead of softened and highly\r\ncoloured matter. These brown-coloured, compact lavas, consist almost\r\nentirely of small glimmering scales, or of minute acicular crystals, of\r\nfeldspar, placed close by the side of each other, and abounding with\r\nminute black specks, apparently of hornblende. The basaltic strata of\r\nProsperous Hill project only a little above the level of the\r\ngently-sloping, feldspathic streams, which wind round and abut against\r\ntheir upturned edges. The inclination of the basaltic strata seems to\r\nbe too great to have been caused by their having flowed down a slope,\r\nand they must have been tilted into their present position before the\r\neruption of the feldspathic streams.\r\n\r\nBASALTIC RING.\r\n\r\nProceeding round the Island, the lavas of the upper series, southward\r\nof Prosperous Hill, overhang the sea in lofty precipices. Further on,\r\nthe headland, called Great Stony-top, is composed, as I believe, of\r\nbasalt; as is Long Range Point, on the inland side of which the\r\ncoloured beds abut. On the southern side of the island, we see the\r\nbasaltic strata of the South Barn, dipping obliquely seaward at a\r\nconsiderable angle; this headland, also, stands a little above the\r\nlevel of the more modern, feldspathic lavas. Further on, a large space\r\nof coast, on each side of Sandy Bay, has been much denuded, and there\r\nseems to be left only the basal wreck of the great, central crater. The\r\nbasaltic strata reappear, with their seaward dip, at the foot of the\r\nhill, called Man-and-Horse; and thence they are continued along the\r\nwhole north-western coast to Sugar-Loaf Hill, situated near to the\r\nFlagstaff; and they everywhere have the same seaward inclination, and\r\nrest, in some parts at least, on the lavas of the basal series. We thus\r\nsee that the circumference of the island is formed by a much-broken\r\nring, or rather, a horse-shoe, of basalt, open to the south, and\r\ninterrupted on the eastern side by many wide breaches. The breadth of\r\nthis marginal fringe on the north-western side, where alone it is at\r\nall perfect, appears to vary from a mile to a mile and a half. The\r\nbasaltic strata, as well as those of the subjacent basal series, dip,\r\nwith a moderate inclination, where they have not been subsequently\r\ndisturbed, towards the sea. The more broken state of the basaltic ring\r\nround the eastern half, compared with the western half of the island,\r\nis evidently due to the much greater denuding power of the waves on the\r\neastern or windward side, as is shown by the greater height of the\r\ncliffs on that side, than to leeward. Whether the margin of basalt was\r\nbreached, before or after the eruption of the lavas of the upper\r\nseries, is doubtful; but as separate portions of the basaltic ring\r\nappear to have been tilted before that event, and from other reasons,\r\nit is more probable, that some at least of the breaches were first\r\nformed. Reconstructing in imagination, as far as is possible, the ring\r\nof basalt, the internal space or hollow, which has since been filled up\r\nwith the matter erupted from the great central crater, appears to have\r\nbeen of an oval figure, eight or nine miles in length by about four\r\nmiles in breadth, and with its axis directed in a N.E. and S W. line,\r\ncoincident with the present longest axis of the island.\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL CURVED RIDGE.\r\n\r\nThis ridge consists, as before remarked, of grey feldspathic lavas, and\r\nof red, brecciated, argillaceous tuffs, like the beds of the upper\r\ncoloured series. The grey lavas contain numerous, minute, black, easily\r\nfusible specks; and but very few large crystals of feldspar. They are\r\ngenerally much softened; with the exception of this character, and of\r\nbeing in many parts highly cellular, they are quite similar to those\r\ngreat sheets of lava which overhang the coast at Prosperous Bay.\r\nConsiderable intervals of time appear to have elapsed, judging from the\r\nmarks of denudation, between the formation of the successive beds, of\r\nwhich this ridge is composed. On the steep northern slope, I observed\r\nin several sections a much worn undulating surface of red tuff, covered\r\nby grey, decomposed, feldspathic lavas, with only a thin earthy layer\r\ninterposed between them. In an adjoining part, I noticed a trap-dike,\r\nfour feet wide, cut off and covered up by the feldspathic lava, as is\r\nrepresented in Figure 9. The ridge ends on the eastern side in a hook,\r\nwhich is not represented clearly enough in any map which I have seen;\r\ntowards the western end, it gradually slopes down and divides into\r\nseveral subordinate ridges. The best defined portion between Diana’s\r\nPeak and Nest Lodge, which supports the highest pinnacles in the island\r\nvarying from 2,000 to 2,700 feet, is rather less than three miles long\r\nin a straight line. Throughout this space the ridge has a uniform\r\nappearance and structure; its curvature resembles that of the\r\ncoast-line of a great bay, being made up of many smaller curves, all\r\nopen to the south. The northern and outer side is supported by narrow\r\nridges or buttresses, which slope down to the adjoining country. The\r\ninside is much steeper, and is almost precipitous; it is formed of the\r\nbasset edges of the strata, which gently decline outwards. Along some\r\nparts of the inner side, a little way beneath the summit, a flat ledge\r\nextends, which imitates in outline the smaller curvatures of the crest.\r\nLedges of this kind occur not unfrequently within volcanic craters, and\r\ntheir formation seems to be due to the sinking down of a level sheet of\r\nhardened lava, the edges of which remain (like the ice round a pool,\r\nfrom which the water has been drained) adhering to the sides. (A most\r\nremarkable instance of this structure is described in Ellis “Polynesian\r\nResearches” second edition where an admirable drawing is given of the\r\nsuccessive ledges or terraces, on the borders of the immense crater at\r\nHawaii, in the Sandwich Islands.)\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 10. DIKE. (Section showing layers 1, 2 and 3 from top to\r\nbottom.)\r\n\r\n1. Grey feldspathic lava.\r\n\r\n2. A layer, one inch in thickness, of a reddish earthy matter.\r\n\r\n3. Brecciated, red, argillaceous tuff.)\r\n\r\nIn some parts, the ridge is surmounted by a wall or parapet,\r\nperpendicular on both sides. Near Diana’s Peak this wall is extremely\r\nnarrow. At the Galapagos Archipelago I observed parapets, having a\r\nquite similar structure and appearance, surmounting several of the\r\ncraters; one, which I more particularly examined, was composed of\r\nglossy, red scoriae firmly cemented together; being externally\r\nperpendicular, and extending round nearly the whole circumference of\r\nthe crater, it rendered it almost inaccessible. The Peak of Teneriffe\r\nand Cotopaxi, according to Humboldt, are similarly constructed; he\r\nstates that “at their summits a circular wall surrounds the crater,\r\nwhich wall, at a distance, has the appearance of a small cylinder\r\nplaced on a truncated cone. (“Personal Narrative” volume 1 page 171.)\r\nOn Cotopaxi this peculiar structure is visible to the naked eye at more\r\nthan two thousand toises’ distance; and no person has ever reached its\r\ncrater. (Humboldt “Picturesque Atlas” folio plate 10.) On the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, the parapet is so high, that it would be impossible to reach\r\nthe caldera, if on the eastern side there did not exist a breach.” The\r\norigin of these circular parapets is probably due to the heat or\r\nvapours from the crater, penetrating and hardening the sides to a\r\nnearly equal depth, and afterwards to the mountain being slowly acted\r\non by the weather, which would leave the hardened part, projecting in\r\nthe form of a cylinder or circular parapet.\r\n\r\nFrom the points of structure in the central ridge, now\r\nenumerated,—namely, from the convergence towards it of the beds of the\r\nupper series,—from the lavas there becoming highly cellular,—from the\r\nflat ledge, extending along its inner and precipitous side, like that\r\nwithin some still active craters,—from the parapet-like wall on its\r\nsummit,—and lastly, from its peculiar curvature, unlike that of any\r\ncommon line of elevation, I cannot doubt that this curved ridge forms\r\nthe last remnant of a great crater. In endeavouring, however, to trace\r\nits former outline, one is soon baffled; its western extremity\r\ngradually slopes down, and, branching into other ridges, extends to the\r\nsea-coast; the eastern end is more curved, but it is only a little\r\nbetter defined. Some appearances lead me to suppose that the southern\r\nwall of the crater joined the present ridge near Nest Lodge; in this\r\ncase the crater must have been nearly three miles long, and about a\r\nmile and a half in breadth. Had the denudation of the ridge and the\r\ndecomposition of its constituent rocks proceeded a few steps further,\r\nand had this ridge, like several other parts of the island, been broken\r\nup by great dikes and masses of injected matter, we should in vain have\r\nendeavoured to discover its true nature. Even now we have seen that at\r\nFlagstaff Hill the lower extremity and most distant portion of one\r\nsheet of the erupted matter has been upheaved to as great a height as\r\nthe crater down which it flowed, and probably even to a greater height.\r\nIt is interesting thus to trace the steps by which the structure of a\r\nvolcanic district becomes obscured, and finally obliterated: so near to\r\nthis last stage is St. Helena, that I believe no one has hitherto\r\nsuspected that the central ridge or axis of the island is the last\r\nwreck of the crater, whence the most modern volcanic streams were\r\npoured forth.\r\n\r\nThe great hollow space or valley southward of the central curved ridge,\r\nacross which the half of the crater must once have extended, is formed\r\nof bare, water-worn hillocks and ridges of red, yellow, and brown\r\nrocks, mingled together in chaos-like confusion, interlaced by dikes,\r\nand without any regular stratification. The chief part consists of red\r\ndecomposing scoriae, associated with various kinds of tuff and yellow\r\nargillaceous beds, full of broken crystals, those of augite being\r\nparticularly large. Here and there masses of highly cellular and\r\namygdaloidal lavas protrude. From one of the ridges in the midst of the\r\nvalley, a conical precipitous hill, called Lot, boldly stands up, and\r\nforms a most singular and conspicuous object. It is composed of\r\nphonolite, divided in one part into great curved laminae, in another,\r\ninto angular concretionary balls, and in a third part into outwardly\r\nradiating columns. At its base the strata of lava, tuff, and scoriae,\r\ndip away on all sides (Abich in his “Views of Vesuvius” plate 6 has\r\nshown the manner in which beds, under nearly similar circumstances, are\r\ntilted up. The upper beds are more turned up than the lower; and he\r\naccounts for this, by showing that the lava insinuates itself\r\nhorizontally between the lower beds.); the uncovered portion is 197\r\nfeet in height (This height is given by Mr. Seale in his Geognosy of\r\nthe island. The height of the summit above the level of the sea is said\r\nto be 1,444 feet.), and its horizontal section gives an oval figure.\r\nThe phonolite is of a greenish-grey colour, and is full of minute\r\nacicular crystals of feldspar; in most parts it has a conchoidal\r\nfracture, and is sonorous, yet it is crenulated with minute\r\nair-cavities. In a S.W. direction from Lot, there are some other\r\nremarkable columnar pinnacles, but of a less regular shape, namely,\r\nLot’s Wife, and the Asses’ Ears, composed of allied kinds of rock. From\r\ntheir flattened shape, and their relative position to each other, they\r\nare evidently connected on the same line of fissure. It is, moreover,\r\nremarkable that this same N.E. and S.W. line, joining Lot and Lot’s\r\nWife, if prolonged would intersect Flagstaff Hill, which, as before\r\nstated, is crossed by numerous dikes running in this direction, and\r\nwhich has a disturbed structure, rendering it probable that a great\r\nbody of once fluid rock lies injected beneath it.\r\n\r\nIn this same great valley there are several other conical masses of\r\ninjected rock (one, I observed, was composed of compact greenstone),\r\nsome of which are not connected, as far as is apparent, with any line\r\nof dike; whilst others are obviously thus connected. Of these dikes,\r\nthree or four great lines stretch across the valley in a N.E. and S.W.\r\ndirection, parallel to that one connecting the Asses’ Ears, Lot’s Wife,\r\nand probably Lot. The number of these masses of injected rock is a\r\nremarkable feature in the geology of St. Helena. Besides those just\r\nmentioned, and the hypothetical one beneath Flagstaff Hill, there is\r\nLittle Stony-top and others, as I have reason to believe, at the\r\nMan-and-Horse, and at High Hill. Most of these masses, if not all of\r\nthem, have been injected subsequently to the last volcanic eruptions\r\nfrom the central crater. The formation of conical bosses of rock on\r\nlines of fissure, the walls of which are in most cases parallel, may\r\nprobably be attributed to inequalities in the tension, causing small\r\ntransverse fissures, and at these points of intersection the edges of\r\nthe strata would naturally yield, and be easily turned upwards.\r\nFinally, I may remark, that hills of phonolite everywhere are apt to\r\nassume singular and even grotesque shapes, like that of Lot\r\n(D’Aubuisson in his “Traite de Geognosie” tome 2 page 540 particularly\r\nremarks that this is the case.): the peak at Fernando Noronha offers an\r\ninstance; at St. Jago, however, the cones of phonolite, though\r\ntapering, have a regular form. Supposing, as seems probable, that all\r\nsuch hillocks or obelisks have originally been injected, whilst\r\nliquified, into a mould formed by yielding strata, as certainly has\r\nbeen the case with Lot, how are we to account for the frequent\r\nabruptness and singularity of their outlines, compared with similarly\r\ninjected masses of greenstone and basalt? Can it be due to a less\r\nperfect degree of fluidity, which is generally supposed to be\r\ncharacteristic of the allied trachytic lavas?\r\n\r\nSUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\nSoft calcareous sandstone occurs in extensive, though thin, superficial\r\nbeds, both on the northern and southern shores of the island. It\r\nconsists of very minute, equal-sized, rounded particles of shells, and\r\nother organic bodies, which partially retain their yellow, brown, and\r\npink colours, and occasionally, though very rarely, present an obscure\r\ntrace of their original external forms. I in vain endeavoured to find a\r\nsingle unrolled fragment of a shell. The colour of the particles is the\r\nmost obvious character by which their origin can be recognised, the\r\ntints being affected (and an odour produced) by a moderate heat, in the\r\nsame manner as in fresh shells. The particles are cemented together,\r\nand are mingled with some earthy matter: the purest masses, according\r\nto Beatson, contain 70 per cent of carbonate of lime. The beds, varying\r\nin thickness from two or three feet to fifteen feet, coat the surface\r\nof the ground; they generally lie on that side of the valley which is\r\nprotected from the wind, and they occur at the height of several\r\nhundred feet above the level of the sea. Their position is the same\r\nwhich sand, if now drifted by the trade-wind, would occupy; and no\r\ndoubt they thus originated, which explains the equal size and\r\nminuteness of the particles, and likewise the entire absence of whole\r\nshells, or even of moderately-sized fragments. It is remarkable that at\r\nthe present day there are no shelly beaches on any part of the coast,\r\nwhence calcareous dust could be drifted and winnowed; we must,\r\ntherefore, look back to a former period when before the land was worn\r\ninto the present great precipices, a shelving coast, like that of\r\nAscension, was favourable to the accumulation of shelly detritus. Some\r\nof the beds of this limestone are between six hundred and seven hundred\r\nfeet above the sea; but part of this height may possibly be due to an\r\nelevation of the land, subsequent to the accumulation of the calcareous\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nThe percolation of rain-water has consolidated parts of these beds into\r\na solid rock, and has formed masses of dark brown, stalagmitic\r\nlimestone. At the Sugar-Loaf quarry, fragments of rock on the adjoining\r\nslopes have been thickly coated by successive fine layers of calcareous\r\nmatter. (In the earthy detritus on several parts of this hill,\r\nirregular masses of very impure, crystallised sulphate of lime occur.\r\nAs this substance is now being abundantly deposited by the surf at\r\nAscension, it is possible that these masses may thus have originated;\r\nbut if so, it must have been at a period when the land stood at a much\r\nlower level. This earthy selenite is now found at a height of between\r\nsix hundred and seven hundred feet.) It is singular, that many of these\r\npebbles have their entire surfaces coated, without any point of contact\r\nhaving been left uncovered; hence, these pebbles must have been lifted\r\nup by the slow deposition between them of the successive films of\r\ncarbonate of lime. Masses of white, finely oolitic rock are attached to\r\nthe outside of some of these coated pebbles. Von Buch has described a\r\ncompact limestone at Lanzarote, which seems perfectly to resemble the\r\nstalagmitic deposition just mentioned: it coats pebbles, and in parts\r\nis finely oolitic: it forms a far-extended layer, from one inch to two\r\nor three feet in thickness, and it occurs at the height of 800 feet\r\nabove the sea, but only on that side of the island exposed to the\r\nviolent north-western winds. Von Buch remarks, that it is not found in\r\nhollows, but only on the unbroken and inclined surfaces of the\r\nmountain. (“Description des Isles Canaries” page 293.) He believes,\r\nthat it has been deposited by the spray which is borne over the whole\r\nisland by these violent winds. It appears, however, to me much more\r\nprobable that it has been formed, as at St. Helena, by the percolation\r\nof water through finely comminuted shells: for when sand is blown on a\r\nmuch-exposed coast, it always tends to accumulate on broad, even\r\nsurfaces, which offer a uniform resistance to the winds. At the\r\nneighbouring island, moreover, of Feurteventura, there is an earthy\r\nlimestone, which, according to Von Buch, is quite similar to specimens\r\nwhich he has seen from St. Helena, and which he believes to have been\r\nformed by the drifting of shelly detritus. (Idem pages 314 and 374.)\r\n\r\nThe upper beds of the limestone, at the above-mentioned quarry on the\r\nSugar-Loaf Hill, are softer, finer-grained and less pure, than the\r\nlower beds. They abound with fragments of land-shells, and with some\r\nperfect ones; they contain, also, the bones of birds, and the large\r\neggs, apparently of water-fowl. (Colonel Wilkes, in a catalogue\r\npresented with some specimens to the Geological Society, states that as\r\nmany as ten eggs were found by one person. Dr. Buckland has remarked\r\n(“Geolog. Trans.” volume 5 page 474) on these eggs.) It is probable\r\nthat these upper beds remained long in an unconsolidated form, during\r\nwhich time, these terrestrial productions were embedded. Mr. G.R.\r\nSowerby has kindly examined three species of land-shells, which I\r\nprocured from this bed, and has described them in detail. One of them\r\nis a Succinea, identical with a species now living abundantly on the\r\nisland; the two others, namely, Cochlogena fossilis and Helix\r\nbiplicata, are not known in a recent state: the latter species was also\r\nfound in another and different locality, associated with a species of\r\nCochlogena which is undoubtedly extinct.\r\n\r\nBEDS OF EXTINCT LAND-SHELLS.\r\n\r\nLand-shells, all of which appear to be species now extinct, occur\r\nembedded in earth, in several parts of the island. The greater number\r\nhave been found at a considerable height on Flagstaff Hill. On the N.W.\r\nside of this hill, a rain-channel exposes a section of about twenty\r\nfeet in thickness, of which the upper part consists of black vegetable\r\nmould, evidently washed down from the heights above, and the lower part\r\nof less black earth, abounding with young and old shells, and with\r\ntheir fragments: part of this earth is slightly consolidated by\r\ncalcareous matter, apparently due to the partial decomposition of some\r\nof the shells. Mr. Seale, an intelligent resident, who first called\r\nattention to these shells, gave me a large collection from another\r\nlocality, where the shells appear to have been embedded in very black\r\nearth. Mr. G.R. Sowerby has examined these shells, and has described\r\nthem. There are seven species, namely, one Cochlogena, two species of\r\nthe genus Cochlicopa, and four of Helix; none of these are known in a\r\nrecent state, or have been found in any other country. The smaller\r\nspecies were picked out of the inside of the large shells of the\r\nCochlogena aurisvulpina. This last-mentioned species is in many\r\nrespects a very singular one; it was classed, even by Lamarck, in a\r\nmarine genus, and having thus been mistaken for a sea-shell, and the\r\nsmaller accompanying species having been overlooked, the exact\r\nlocalities where it was found have been measured, and the elevation of\r\nthis island thus deduced! It is very remarkable that all the shells of\r\nthis species found by me in one spot, form a distinct variety, as\r\ndescribed by Mr. Sowerby, from those procured from another locality by\r\nMr. Seale. As this Cochlogena is a large and conspicuous shell, I\r\nparticularly inquired from several intelligent countrymen whether they\r\nhad ever seen it alive; they all assured me that they had not, and they\r\nwould not even believe that it was a land animal: Mr. Seale, moreover,\r\nwho was a collector of shells all his life at St. Helena, never met\r\nwith it alive. Possibly some of the smaller species may turn out to be\r\nyet living kinds; but, on the other hand, the two land- shells which\r\nare now living on the island in great numbers, do not occur embedded,\r\nas far as is yet known, with the extinct species. I have shown in my\r\n“Journal” (“Journal of Researches” page 582.), that the extinction of\r\nthese land-shells possibly may not be an ancient event; as a great\r\nchange took place in the state of the island about one hundred and\r\ntwenty years ago, when the old trees died, and were not replaced by\r\nyoung ones, these being destroyed by the goats and hogs, which had run\r\nwild in numbers, from the year 1502. Mr. Seale states, that on\r\nFlagstaff Hill, where we have seen that the embedded land-shells are\r\nespecially numerous, traces are everywhere discoverable, which plainly\r\nindicate that it was once thickly clothed with trees; at present not\r\neven a bush grows there. The thick bed of black vegetable mould which\r\ncovers the shell-bed, on the flanks of this hill, was probably washed\r\ndown from the upper part, as soon as the trees perished, and the\r\nshelter afforded by them was lost.\r\n\r\nELEVATION OF THE LAND.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the lavas of the basal series, which are of submarine\r\norigin, are raised above the level of the sea, and at some places to\r\nthe height of many hundred feet, I looked out for superficial signs of\r\nthe elevation of the land. The bottoms of some of the gorges, which\r\ndescend to the coast, are filled up to the depth of about a hundred\r\nfeet, by rudely divided layers of sand, muddy clay, and fragmentary\r\nmasses; in these beds, Mr. Seale has found the bones of the tropic-bird\r\nand of the albatross; the former now rarely, and the latter never\r\nvisiting the island. From the difference between these layers, and the\r\nsloping piles of detritus which rest on them, I suspect that they were\r\ndeposited, when the gorges stood beneath the sea. Mr. Seale, moreover,\r\nhas shown that some of the fissure- like gorges become, with a concave\r\noutline, gradually rather wider at the bottom than at the top; and this\r\npeculiar structure was probably caused by the wearing action of the\r\nsea, when it entered the lower part of these gorges. (A fissure-like\r\ngorge, near Stony-top, is said by Mr. Seale to be 840 feet deep, and\r\nonly 115 feet in width.) At greater heights, the evidence of the rise\r\nof the land is even less clear: nevertheless, in a bay-like depression\r\non the table-land behind Prosperous Bay, at the height of about a\r\nthousand feet, there are flat-topped masses of rock, which it is\r\nscarcely conceivable, could have been insulated from the surrounding\r\nand similar strata, by any other agency than the denuding action of a\r\nsea- beach. Much denudation, indeed, has been effected at great\r\nelevations, which it would not be easy to explain by any other means:\r\nthus, the flat summit of the Barn, which is 2,000 feet high, presents,\r\naccording to Mr. Seale, a perfect network of truncated dikes; on hills\r\nlike the Flagstaff, formed of soft rock, we might suppose that the\r\ndikes had been worn down and cut off by meteoric agency, but we can\r\nhardly suppose this possible with the hard, basaltic strata of the\r\nBarn.\r\n\r\nCOAST DENUDATION.\r\n\r\nThe enormous cliffs, in many parts between one and two thousand feet in\r\nheight, with which this prison-like island is surrounded, with the\r\nexception of only a few places, where narrow valleys descend to the\r\ncoast, is the most striking feature in its scenery. We have seen that\r\nportions of the basaltic ring, two or three miles in length by one or\r\ntwo miles in breadth, and from one to two thousand feet in height, have\r\nbeen wholly removed. There are, also, ledges and banks of rock, rising\r\nout of profoundly deep water, and distant from the present coast\r\nbetween three and four miles, which, according to Mr. Seale, can be\r\ntraced to the shore, and are found to be the continuations of certain\r\nwell-known great dikes. The swell of the Atlantic Ocean has obviously\r\nbeen the active power in forming these cliffs; and it is interesting to\r\nobserve that the lesser, though still great, height of the cliffs on\r\nthe leeward and partially protected side of the island (extending from\r\nthe Sugar-Loaf Hill to South West Point), corresponds with the lesser\r\ndegree of exposure. When reflecting on the comparatively low coasts of\r\nmany volcanic islands, which also stand exposed in the open ocean, and\r\nare apparently of considerable antiquity, the mind recoils from an\r\nattempt to grasp the number of centuries of exposure, necessary to have\r\nground into mud and to have dispersed the enormous cubic mass of hard\r\nrock which has been pared off the circumference of this island. The\r\ncontrast in the superficial state of St. Helena, compared with the\r\nnearest island, namely, Ascension, is very striking. At Ascension, the\r\nsurfaces of the lava-streams are glossy, as if just poured forth, their\r\nboundaries are well defined, and they can often be traced to perfect\r\ncraters, whence they were erupted; in the course of many long walks, I\r\ndid not observe a single dike; and the coast round nearly the entire\r\ncircumference is low, and has been eaten back (though too much stress\r\nmust not be placed on this fact, as the island may have been subsiding)\r\ninto a little wall only from ten to thirty feet high. Yet during the\r\n340 years, since Ascension has been known, not even the feeblest signs\r\nof volcanic action have been recorded. (In the “Nautical Magazine” for\r\n1835 page 642, and for 1838 page 361, and in the “Comptes Rendus” April\r\n1838, accounts are given of a series of volcanic\r\nphenomena—earthquakes—troubled water—floating scoriae and columns of\r\nsmoke—which have been observed at intervals since the middle of the\r\nlast century, in a space of open sea between longitudes 20 degrees and\r\n22 degrees west, about half a degree south of the equator. These facts\r\nseem to show, that an island or an archipelago is in process of\r\nformation in the middle of the Atlantic: a line joining St. Helena and\r\nAscension, prolonged, intersects this slowly nascent focus of volcanic\r\naction.) On the other hand, at St. Helena, the course of no one stream\r\nof lava can be traced, either by the state of its boundaries or of its\r\nsuperficies; the mere wreck of one great crater is left; not the\r\nvalleys only, but the surfaces of some of the highest hills, are\r\ninterlaced by worn-down dikes, and, in many places, the denuded summits\r\nof great cones of injected rock stand exposed and naked; lastly, as we\r\nhave seen, the entire circuit of the island has been deeply worn back\r\ninto the grandest precipices.\r\n\r\nCRATERS OF ELEVATION.\r\n\r\nThere is much resemblance in structure and in geological history\r\nbetween St. Helena, St. Jago, and Mauritius. All three islands are\r\nbounded (at least in the parts which I was able to examine) by a ring\r\nof basaltic mountains, now much broken, but evidently once continuous.\r\nThese mountains have, or apparently once had, their escarpments steep\r\ntowards the interior of the island, and their strata dip outwards. I\r\nwas able to ascertain, only in a few cases, the inclination of the\r\nbeds; nor was this easy, for the stratification was generally obscure,\r\nexcept when viewed from a distance. I feel, however, little doubt that,\r\naccording to the researches of M. Elie de Beaumont, their average\r\ninclination is greater than that which they could have acquired,\r\nconsidering their thickness and compactness, by flowing down a sloping\r\nsurface. At St. Helena, and at St. Jago, the basaltic strata rest on\r\nolder and probably submarine beds of different composition. At all\r\nthree islands, deluges of more recent lavas have flowed from the centre\r\nof the island, towards and between the basaltic mountains; and at St.\r\nHelena the central platform has been filled up by them. All three\r\nislands have been raised in mass. At Mauritius the sea, within a late\r\ngeological period, must have reached to the foot of the basaltic\r\nmountains, as it now does at St. Helena; and at St. Jago it is cutting\r\nback the intermediate plain towards them. In these three islands, but\r\nespecially at St. Jago and at Mauritius, when, standing on the summit\r\nof one of the old basaltic mountains, one looks in vain towards the\r\ncentre of the island,—the point towards which the strata beneath one’s\r\nfeet, and of the mountains on each side, rudely converge,—for a source\r\nwhence these strata could have been erupted; but one sees only a vast\r\nhollow platform stretched beneath, or piles of matter of more recent\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThese basaltic mountains come, I presume, into the class of Craters of\r\nelevation: it is immaterial whether the rings were ever completely\r\nformed, for the portions which now exist have so uniform a structure,\r\nthat, if they do not form fragments of true craters, they cannot be\r\nclassed with ordinary lines of elevation. With respect to their origin,\r\nafter having read the works of Mr. Lyell (“Principles of Geology” fifth\r\nedition volume 2 page 171.), and of MM. C. Prevost and Virlet, I cannot\r\nbelieve that the great central hollows have been formed by a simple\r\ndome-shaped elevation, and the consequent arching of the strata. On the\r\nother hand, I have very great difficulty in admitting that these\r\nbasaltic mountains are merely the basal fragments of great volcanoes,\r\nof which the summits have either been blown off, or more probably\r\nswallowed up by subsidence. These rings are, in some instances, so\r\nimmense, as at St. Jago and at Mauritius, and their occurrence is so\r\nfrequent, that I can hardly persuade myself to adopt this explanation.\r\nMoreover, I suspect that the following circumstances, from their\r\nfrequent concurrence, are someway connected together,—a connection not\r\nimplied in either of the above views: namely, first, the broken state\r\nof the ring; showing that the now detached portions have been exposed\r\nto great denudation, and in some cases, perhaps, rendering it probable\r\nthat the ring never was entire; secondly, the great amount of matter\r\nerupted from the central area after or during the formation of the\r\nring; and thirdly, the elevation of the district in mass. As far as\r\nrelates to the inclination of the strata being greater than that which\r\nthe basal fragments of ordinary volcanoes would naturally possess, I\r\ncan readily believe that this inclination might have been slowly\r\nacquired by that amount of elevation, of which, according to M. Elie de\r\nBeaumont, the numerous upfilled fissures or dikes are the evidence and\r\nthe measure,—a view equally novel and important, which we owe to the\r\nresearches of that geologist on Mount Etna.\r\n\r\nA conjecture, including the above circumstances, occurred to me, when,—\r\nwith my mind fully convinced, from the phenomena of 1835 in South\r\nAmerica, that the forces which eject matter from volcanic orifices and\r\nraise continents in mass are identical,—I viewed that part of the coast\r\nof St. Jago, where the horizontally upraised, calcareous stratum dips\r\ninto the sea, directly beneath a cone of subsequently erupted lava. (I\r\nhave given a detailed account of these phenomena, in a paper read\r\nbefore the Geological Society in March 1838. At the instant of time,\r\nwhen an immense area was convulsed and a large tract elevated, the\r\ndistricts immediately surrounding several of the great vents in the\r\nCordillera remained quiescent; the subterranean forces being apparently\r\nrelieved by the eruptions, which then recommenced with great violence.\r\nAn event of somewhat the same kind, but on an infinitely smaller scale,\r\nappears to have taken place, according to Abich (“Views of Vesuvius”\r\nplates 1 and 9), within the great crater of Vesuvius, where a platform\r\non one side of a fissure was raised in mass twenty feet, whilst on the\r\nother side, a train of small volcanoes burst forth in eruption.) The\r\nconjecture is that, during the slow elevation of a volcanic district or\r\nisland, in the centre of which one or more orifices continue open, and\r\nthus relieve the subterranean forces, the borders are elevated more\r\nthan the central area; and that the portions thus upraised do not slope\r\ngently into the central, less elevated area, as does the calcareous\r\nstratum under the cone at St. Jago, and as does a large part of the\r\ncircumference of Iceland, but that they are separated from it by curved\r\nfaults. (It appears, from information communicated to me in the most\r\nobliging manner by M. E. Robert, that the circumferential parts of\r\nIceland, which are composed of ancient basaltic strata alternating with\r\ntuff, dip inland, thus forming a gigantic saucer. M. Robert found that\r\nthis was the case, with a few and quite local exceptions, for a space\r\nof coast several hundred miles in length. I find this statement\r\ncorroborated, as far as regards one place, by Mackenzie in his\r\n“Travels” page 377, and in another place by some MS. notes kindly lent\r\nme by Dr. Holland. The coast is deeply indented by creeks, at the head\r\nof which the land is generally low. M. Robert informs me, that the\r\ninwardly dipping strata appear to extend as far as this line, and that\r\ntheir inclination usually corresponds with the slope of the surface,\r\nfrom the high coast-mountains to the low land at the head of these\r\ncreeks. In the section described by Sir G. Mackenzie, the dip is 120.\r\nThe interior parts of the island chiefly consist, as far as is known,\r\nof recently erupted matter. The great size, however, of Iceland,\r\nequalling the bulkiest part of England, ought perhaps to exclude it\r\nfrom the class of islands we have been considering; but I cannot avoid\r\nsuspecting that if the coast-mountains, instead of gently sloping into\r\nthe less elevated central area, had been separated from it by\r\nirregularly curved faults, the strata would have been tilted seaward,\r\nand a “Crater of elevation,” like that of St. Jago or that of\r\nMauritius, but of much vaster dimensions, would have been formed. I\r\nwill only further remark, that the frequent occurrence of extensive\r\nlakes at the foot of large volcanoes, and the frequent association of\r\nvolcanic and fresh-water strata, seem to indicate that the areas around\r\nvolcanoes are apt to be depressed beneath the level of the adjoining\r\ncountry, either from having been less elevated, or from the effects of\r\nsubsidence.) We might expect, from what we see along ordinary faults,\r\nthat the strata on the upraised side, already dipping outwards from\r\ntheir original formation as lava-streams, would be tilted from the line\r\nof fault, and thus have their inclination increased. According to this\r\nhypothesis, which I am tempted to extend only to some few cases, it is\r\nnot probable that the ring would ever be formed quite perfect; and from\r\nthe elevation being slow, the upraised portions would generally be\r\nexposed to much denudation, and hence the ring become broken; we might\r\nalso expect to find occasional inequalities in the dip of the upraised\r\nmasses, as is the case at St. Jago. By this hypothesis the elevation of\r\nthe districts in mass, and the flowing of deluges of lava from the\r\ncentral platforms, are likewise connected together. On this view the\r\nmarginal basaltic mountains of the three foregoing islands might still\r\nbe considered as forming “Craters of elevation;” the kind of elevation\r\nimplied having been slow, and the central hollow or platform having\r\nbeen formed, not by the arching of the surface, but simply by that part\r\nhaving been upraised to a less height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nGALAPAGOS ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nChatham Island.

GALAPAGOS ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\nShowing Wenman, Abingdon, Bindloes, Tower, Narborough, Albemarle,\r\nJames, Indefatigable, Barrington, Chatham, Charles and Hood’s Islands.)\r\n\r\nThis archipelago is situated under the equator, at a distance of\r\nbetween five and six hundred miles from the west coast of South\r\nAmerica. It consists of five principal islands, and of several small\r\nones, which together are equal in area, but not in extent of land, to\r\nSicily, conjointly with the Ionian Islands. (I exclude from this\r\nmeasurement, the small volcanic islands of Culpepper and Wenman, lying\r\nseventy miles northward of the group. Craters were visible on all the\r\nislands of the group, except on Towers Island, which is one of the\r\nlowest; this island is, however, formed of volcanic rocks.) They are\r\nall volcanic: on two, craters have been seen in eruption, and on\r\nseveral of the other islands, streams of lava have a recent appearance.\r\nThe larger islands are chiefly composed of solid rock, and they rise\r\nwith a tame outline to a height of between one and four thousand feet.\r\nThey are sometimes, but not generally, surmounted by one principal\r\norifice. The craters vary in size from mere spiracles to huge caldrons\r\nseveral miles in circumference; they are extraordinarily numerous, so\r\nthat I should think, if enumerated, they would be found to exceed two\r\nthousand; they are formed either of scoriae and lava, or of a\r\nbrown-coloured tuff; and these latter craters are in several respects\r\nremarkable. The whole group was surveyed by the officers of the\r\n“Beagle.” I visited myself four of the principal islands, and received\r\nspecimens from all the others. Under the head of the different islands\r\nI will describe only that which appears to me deserving of attention.\r\n\r\nCHATHAM ISLAND. CRATERS COMPOSED OF A SINGULAR KIND OF TUFF.\r\n\r\nTowards the eastern end of this island there occur two craters composed\r\nof two kinds of tuff; one kind being friable, like slightly\r\nconsolidated ashes; and the other compact, and of a different nature\r\nfrom anything which I have met with described. This latter substance,\r\nwhere it is best characterised, is of a yellowish-brown colour,\r\ntranslucent, and with a lustre somewhat resembling resin; it is\r\nbrittle, with an angular, rough, and very irregular fracture,\r\nsometimes, however, being slightly granular, and even obscurely\r\ncrystalline: it can readily be scratched with a knife, yet some points\r\nare hard enough just to mark common glass; it fuses with ease into a\r\nblackish-green glass. The mass contains numerous broken crystals of\r\nolivine and augite, and small particles of black and brown scoriae; it\r\nis often traversed by thin seams of calcareous matter. It generally\r\naffects a nodular or concretionary structure. In a hand specimen, this\r\nsubstance would certainly be mistaken for a pale and peculiar variety\r\nof pitchstone; but when seen in mass its stratification, and the\r\nnumerous layers of fragments of basalt, both angular and rounded, at\r\nonce render its subaqueous origin evident. An examination of a series\r\nof specimens shows that this resin-like substance results from a\r\nchemical change on small particles of pale and dark-coloured\r\nscoriaceous rocks; and this change could be distinctly traced in\r\ndifferent stages round the edges of even the same particle. The\r\nposition near the coast of all the craters composed of this kind of\r\ntuff or peperino, and their breached condition, renders it probable\r\nthat they were all formed when standing immersed in the sea;\r\nconsidering this circumstance, together with the remarkable absence of\r\nlarge beds of ashes in the whole archipelago, I think it highly\r\nprobable that much the greater part of the tuff has originated from the\r\ntrituration of fragments of the grey, basaltic lavas in the mouths of\r\ncraters standing in the sea. It may be asked whether the heated water\r\nwithin these craters has produced this singular change in the small\r\nscoriaceous particles and given to them their translucent, resin-like\r\nfracture. Or has the associated lime played any part in this change? I\r\nask these questions from having found at St. Jago, in the Cape de Verde\r\nIslands, that where a great stream of molten lava has flowed over a\r\ncalcareous bottom into the sea, the outermost film, which in other\r\nparts resembles pitchstone, is changed, apparently by its contact with\r\nthe carbonate of lime, into a resin-like substance, precisely like the\r\nbest characterised specimens of the tuff from this archipelago. (The\r\nconcretions containing lime, which I have described at Ascension, as\r\nformed in a bed of ashes, present some degree of resemblance to this\r\nsubstance, but they have not a resinous fracture. At St. Helena, also,\r\nI found veins of a somewhat similar, compact, but non- resinous\r\nsubstance, occurring in a bed of pumiceous ashes, apparently free from\r\ncalcareous matter: in neither of these cases could heat have acted.)\r\n\r\nTo return to the two craters: one of them stands at the distance of a\r\nleague from the coast, the intervening tract consisting of a calcareous\r\ntuff, apparently of submarine origin. This crater consists of a circle\r\nof hills some of which stand quite detached, but all have a very\r\nregular, qua- qua versal dip, at an inclination of between thirty and\r\nforty degrees. The lower beds, to the thickness of several hundred\r\nfeet, consist of the resin- like stone, with embedded fragments of\r\nlava. The upper beds, which are between thirty and forty feet in\r\nthickness, are composed of a thinly stratified, fine-grained, harsh,\r\nfriable, brown-coloured tuff, or peperino. (Those geologists who\r\nrestrict the term of “tuff” to ashes of a white colour, resulting from\r\nthe attrition of feldspathic lavas, would call these brown-coloured\r\nstrata “peperino.”) A central mass without any stratification, which\r\nmust formerly have occupied the hollow of the crater, but is now\r\nattached only to a few of the circumferential hills, consists of a\r\ntuff, intermediate in character between that with a resin-like, and\r\nthat with an earthy fracture. This mass contains white calcareous\r\nmatter in small patches. The second crater (520 feet in height) must\r\nhave existed until the eruption of a recent, great stream of lava, as a\r\nseparate islet; a fine section, worn by the sea, shows a grand\r\nfunnel-shaped mass of basalt, surrounded by steep, sloping flanks of\r\ntuff, having in parts an earthy, and in others a semi-resinous\r\nfracture. The tuff is traversed by several broad, vertical dikes, with\r\nsmooth and parallel sides, which I did not doubt were formed of basalt,\r\nuntil I actually broke off fragments. These dikes, however, consist of\r\ntuff like that of the surrounding strata, but more compact, and with a\r\nsmoother fracture; hence we must conclude, that fissures were formed\r\nand filled up with the finer mud or tuff from the crater, before its\r\ninterior was occupied, as it now is, by a solidified pool of basalt.\r\nOther fissures have been subsequently formed, parallel to these\r\nsingular dikes, and are merely filled with loose rubbish. The change\r\nfrom ordinary scoriaceous particles to the substance with a\r\nsemi-resinous fracture, could be clearly followed in portions of the\r\ncompact tuff of these dikes.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 12. THE KICKER ROCK, 400 FEET HIGH.)\r\n\r\nAt the distance of a few miles from these two craters, stands the\r\nKicker Rock, or islet, remarkable from its singular form. It is\r\nunstratified, and is composed of compact tuff, in parts having the\r\nresin-like fracture. It is probable that this amorphous mass, like that\r\nsimilar mass in the case first described, once filled up the central\r\nhollow of a crater, and that its flanks, or sloping walls, have since\r\nbeen worn quite away by the sea, in which it stands exposed.\r\n\r\nSMALL BASALTIC CRATERS.\r\n\r\nA bare, undulating tract, at the eastern end of Chatham Island, is\r\nremarkable from the number, proximity, and form of the small basaltic\r\ncraters with which it is studded. They consist, either of a mere\r\nconical pile, or, but less commonly, of a circle, of black and red,\r\nglossy scoriae, partially cemented together. They vary in diameter from\r\nthirty to one hundred and fifty yards, and rise from about fifty to one\r\nhundred feet above the level of the surrounding plain. From one small\r\neminence, I counted sixty of these craters, all of which were within a\r\nthird of a mile from each other, and many were much closer. I measured\r\nthe distance between two very small craters, and found that it was only\r\nthirty yards from the summit-rim of one to the rim of the other. Small\r\nstreams of black, basaltic lava, containing olivine and much glassy\r\nfeldspar, have flowed from many, but not from all of these craters. The\r\nsurfaces of the more recent streams were exceedingly rugged, and were\r\ncrossed by great fissures; the older streams were only a little less\r\nrugged; and they were all blended and mingled together in complete\r\nconfusion. The different growth, however, of the trees on the streams,\r\noften plainly marked their different ages. Had it not been for this\r\nlatter character, the streams could in few cases have been\r\ndistinguished; and, consequently, this wide undulatory tract might have\r\n(as probably many tracts have) been erroneously considered as formed by\r\none great deluge of lava, instead of by a multitude of small streams,\r\nerupted from many small orifices.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of this tract, and especially at the base of the small\r\ncraters, there are circular pits, with perpendicular sides, from twenty\r\nto forty feet deep. At the foot of one small crater, there were three\r\nof these pits. They have probably been formed, by the falling in of the\r\nroofs of small caverns. (M. Elie de Beaumont has described (“Mem. pour\r\nservir” etc. tome 4 page 113) many “petits cirques d’eboulement” on\r\nEtna, of some of which the origin is historically known.) In other\r\nparts, there are mammiform hillocks, which resemble great bubbles of\r\nlava, with their summits fissured by irregular cracks, which appeared,\r\nupon entering them, to be very deep; lava has not flowed from these\r\nhillocks. There are, also, other very regular, mammiform hillocks,\r\ncomposed of stratified lava, and surmounted by circular, steep-sided\r\nhollows, which, I suppose have been formed by a body of gas, first,\r\narching the strata into one of the bubble- like hillocks, and then,\r\nblowing off its summit. These several kinds of hillocks and pits, as\r\nwell as the numerous, small, scoriaceous craters, all show that this\r\ntract has been penetrated, almost like a sieve, by the passage of\r\nheated vapours. The more regular hillocks could only have been heaved\r\nup, whilst the lava was in a softened state. (Sir G. Mackenzie “Travels\r\nin Iceland” pages 389 to 392, has described a plain of lava at the foot\r\nof Hecla, everywhere heaved up into great bubbles or blisters. Sir\r\nGeorge states that this cavernous lava composes the uppermost stratum;\r\nand the same fact is affirmed by Von Buch “Descript. des Isles\r\nCanaries” page 159, with respect to the basaltic stream near Rialejo,\r\nin Teneriffe. It appears singular that it should be the upper streams\r\nthat are chiefly cavernous, for one sees no reason why the upper and\r\nlower should not have been equally affected at different times;—have\r\nthe inferior streams flowed beneath the pressure of the sea, and thus\r\nbeen flattened, after the passage through them, of bodies of gas?)\r\n\r\nALBEMARLE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nThis island consists of five, great, flat-topped craters, which,\r\ntogether with the one on the adjoining island of Narborough, singularly\r\nresemble each other, in form and height. The southern one is 4,700 feet\r\nhigh, two others are 3,720 feet, a third only 50 feet higher, and the\r\nremaining ones apparently of nearly the same height. Three of these are\r\nsituated on one line, and their craters appear elongated in nearly the\r\nsame direction. The northern crater, which is not the largest, was\r\nfound by the triangulation to measure, externally, no less than three\r\nmiles and one-eighth of a mile in diameter. Over the lips of these\r\ngreat, broad caldrons, and from little orifices near their summits,\r\ndeluges of black lava have flowed down their naked sides.\r\n\r\nFLUIDITY OF DIFFERENT LAVAS.\r\n\r\nNear Tagus or Banks’ Cove, I examined one of these great streams of\r\nlava, which is remarkable from the evidence of its former high degree\r\nof fluidity, especially when its composition is considered. Near the\r\nsea-coast this stream is several miles in width. It consists of a\r\nblack, compact base, easily fusible into a black bead, with angular and\r\nnot very numerous air-cells, and thickly studded with large, fractured\r\ncrystals of glassy albite, varying from the tenth of an inch to half an\r\ninch in diameter. (In the Cordillera of Chile, I have seen lava very\r\nclosely resembling this variety at the Galapagos Archipelago. It\r\ncontained, however, besides the albite, well-formed crystals of augite,\r\nand the base (perhaps in consequence of the aggregation of the augitic\r\nparticles) was a shade lighter in colour. I may here remark, that in\r\nall these cases, I call the feldspathic crystals, “albite,” from their\r\ncleavage-planes (as measured by the reflecting goniometer)\r\ncorresponding with those of that mineral. As, however, other species of\r\nthis genus have lately been discovered to cleave in nearly the same\r\nplanes with albite, this determination must be considered as only\r\nprovisional. I examined the crystals in the lavas of many different\r\nparts of the Galapagos group, and I found that none of them, with the\r\nexception of some crystals from one part of James Island, cleaved in\r\nthe direction of orthite or potash-feldspar.) This lava, although at\r\nfirst sight appearing eminently porphyritic, cannot properly be\r\nconsidered so, for the crystals have evidently been enveloped, rounded,\r\nand penetrated by the lava, like fragments of foreign rock in a\r\ntrap-dike. This was very clear in some specimens of a similar lava,\r\nfrom Abingdon Island, in which the only difference was, that the\r\nvesicles were spherical and more numerous. The albite in these lavas is\r\nin a similar condition with the leucite of Vesuvius, and with the\r\nolivine, described by Von Buch, as projecting in great balls from the\r\nbasalt of Lanzarote. (“Description des Isles Canaries” page 295.)\r\nBesides the albite, this lava contains scattered grains of a green\r\nmineral, with no distinct cleavage, and closely resembling olivine\r\n(Humboldt mentions that he mistook a green augitic mineral, occurring\r\nin the volcanic rocks of the Cordillera of Quito, for olivine.); but as\r\nit fuses easily into a green glass, it belongs probably to the augitic\r\nfamily: at James Island, however, a similar lava contained true\r\nolivine. I obtained specimens from the actual surface, and from a depth\r\nof four feet, but they differed in no respect. The high degree of\r\nfluidity of this lava-stream was at once evident, from its smooth and\r\ngently sloping surface, from the manner in which the main stream was\r\ndivided by small inequalities into little rills, and especially from\r\nthe manner in which its edges, far below its source, and where it must\r\nhave been in some degree cooled, thinned out to almost nothing; the\r\nactual margin consisting of loose fragments, few of which were larger\r\nthan a man’s head. The contrast between this margin, and the steep\r\nwalls, above twenty feet high, bounding many of the basaltic streams at\r\nAscension, is very remarkable. It has generally been supposed that\r\nlavas abounding with large crystals, and including angular vesicles,\r\nhave possessed little fluidity; but we see that the case has been very\r\ndifferent at Albemarle Island. (The irregular and angular form of the\r\nvesicles is probably caused by the unequal yielding of a mass composed,\r\nin almost equal proportion, of solid crystals and of a viscid base. It\r\ncertainly seems a general circumstance, as might have been expected,\r\nthat in lava, which has possessed a high degree of fluidity, AS WELL AS\r\nAN EVEN-SIZED GRAIN, the vesicles are internally smooth and spherical.)\r\nThe degree of fluidity in different lavas, does not seem to correspond\r\nwith any APPARENT corresponding amount of difference in their\r\ncomposition: at Chatham Island, some streams, containing much glassy\r\nalbite and some olivine, are so rugged, that they may be compared to a\r\nsea frozen during a storm; whilst the great stream at Albemarle Island\r\nis almost as smooth as a lake when ruffled by a breeze. At James\r\nIsland, black basaltic lava, abounding with small grains of olivine,\r\npresents an intermediate degree of roughness; its surface being glossy,\r\nand the detached fragments resembling, in a very singular manner, folds\r\nof drapery, cables, and pieces of the bark of trees. (A specimen of\r\nbasaltic lava, with a few small broken crystals of albite, given me by\r\none of the officers, is perhaps worthy of description. It consists of\r\ncylindrical ramifications, some of which are only the twentieth of an\r\ninch in diameter, and are drawn out into the sharpest points. The mass\r\nhas not been formed like a stalactite, for the points terminate both\r\nupwards and downwards. Globules, only the fortieth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, have dropped from some of the points, and adhere to the\r\nadjoining branches. The lava is vesicular, but the vesicles never reach\r\nthe surface of the branches, which are smooth and glossy. As it is\r\ngenerally supposed that vesicles are always elongated in the direction\r\nof the movement of the fluid mass, I may observe, that in these\r\ncylindrical branches, which vary from a quarter to only the twentieth\r\nof an inch in diameter, every air-cell is spherical.)\r\n\r\nCRATERS OF TUFF.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile southward of Banks’ Cove, there is a fine elliptic crater,\r\nabout five hundred feet in depth, and three-quarters of a mile in\r\ndiameter. Its bottom is occupied by a lake of brine, out of which some\r\nlittle crateriform hills of tuff rise. The lower beds are formed of\r\ncompact tuff, appearing like a subaqueous deposit; whilst the upper\r\nbeds, round the entire circumference, consist of a harsh, friable tuff,\r\nof little specific gravity, but often containing fragments of rock in\r\nlayers. This upper tuff contains numerous pisolitic balls, about the\r\nsize of small bullets, which differ from the surrounding matter, only\r\nin being slightly harder and finer grained. The beds dip away very\r\nregularly on all sides, at angles varying, as I found by measurement,\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty degrees. The external surface of the crater\r\nslopes at a nearly similar inclination, and is formed by slightly\r\nconvex ribs, like those on the shell of a pecten or scallop, which\r\nbecome broader as they extend from the mouth of the crater to its base.\r\nThese ribs are generally from eight to twenty feet in breadth, but\r\nsometimes they are as much as forty feet broad; and they resemble old,\r\nplastered, much flattened vaults, with the plaster scaling off in\r\nplates: they are separated from each other by gullies, deepened by\r\nalluvial action. At their upper and narrow ends, near the mouth of the\r\ncrater, these ribs often consist of real hollow passages, like, but\r\nrather smaller than, those often formed by the cooling of the crust of\r\na lava-stream, whilst the inner parts have flowed onward;—of which\r\nstructure I saw many examples at Chatham Island. There can be no doubt\r\nbut that these hollow ribs or vaults have been formed in a similar\r\nmanner, namely, by the setting or hardening of a superficial crust on\r\nstreams of mud, which have flowed down from the upper part of the\r\ncrater. In another part of this same crater, I saw open concave gutters\r\nbetween one and two feet wide, which appear to have been formed by the\r\nhardening of the lower surface of a mud stream, instead of, as in the\r\nformer case, of the upper surface. From these facts I think it is\r\ncertain that the tuff must have flowed as mud. (This conclusion is of\r\nsome interest, because M. Dufrenoy “Mem. pour servir” tome 4 page 274,\r\nhas argued from strata of tuff, apparently of similar composition with\r\nthat here described, being inclined at angles between 18 degrees and 20\r\ndegrees, that Monte Nuevo and some other craters of Southern Italy have\r\nbeen formed by upheaval. From the facts given above, of the vaulted\r\ncharacter of the separate rills, and from the tuff not extending in\r\nhorizontal sheets round these crateriform hills, no one will suppose\r\nthat the strata have here been produced by elevation; and yet we see\r\nthat their inclination is above 20 degrees, and often as much as 30\r\ndegrees. The consolidated strata also, of the internal talus, as will\r\nbe immediately seen, dips at an angle of above 30 degrees.) This mud\r\nmay have been formed either within the crater, or from ashes deposited\r\non its upper parts, and afterwards washed down by torrents of rain. The\r\nformer method, in most of the cases, appears the more probable one; at\r\nJames Island, however, some beds of the friable kind of tuff extend so\r\ncontinuously over an uneven surface, that probably they were formed by\r\nthe falling of showers of ashes.\r\n\r\nWithin this same crater, strata of coarse tuff, chiefly composed of\r\nfragments of lava, abut, like a consolidated talus, against the inside\r\nwalls. They rise to a height of between one hundred and one hundred and\r\nfifty feet above the surface of the internal brine-lake; they dip\r\ninwards, and are inclined at an angle varying from thirty to thirty-six\r\ndegrees. They appear to have been formed beneath water, probably at a\r\nperiod when the sea occupied the hollow of the crater. I was surprised\r\nto observe that beds having this great inclination did not, as far as\r\nthey could be followed, thicken towards their lower extremities.\r\n\r\nBANKS’ COVE.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 13. A SECTIONAL SKETCH OF THE HEADLANDS FORMING BANKS’ COVE,\r\nshowing the diverging crateriform strata, and the converging stratified\r\ntalus. The highest point of these hills is 817 feet above the sea.)\r\n\r\nThis harbour occupies part of the interior of a shattered crater of\r\ntuff larger than that last described. All the tuff is compact, and\r\nincludes numerous fragments of lava; it appears like a subaqueous\r\ndeposit. The most remarkable feature in this crater is the great\r\ndevelopment of strata converging inwards, as in the last case, at a\r\nconsiderable inclination, and often deposited in irregular curved\r\nlayers. These interior converging beds, as well as the proper,\r\ndiverging crateriform strata, are represented in Figure 13, a rude,\r\nsectional sketch of the headlands, forming this Cove. The internal and\r\nexternal strata differ little in composition, and the former have\r\nevidently resulted from the wear and tear, and redeposition of the\r\nmatter forming the external crateriform strata. From the great\r\ndevelopment of these inner beds, a person walking round the rim of this\r\ncrater might fancy himself on a circular anticlinal ridge of stratified\r\nsandstone and conglomerate. The sea is wearing away the inner and outer\r\nstrata, and especially the latter; so that the inwardly converging\r\nstrata will, perhaps, in some future age, be left standing alone—a case\r\nwhich might at first perplex a geologist. (I believe that this case\r\nactually occurs in the Azores, where Dr. Webster “Description” page\r\n185, has described a basin-formed, little island, composed of STRATA OF\r\nTUFF, dipping inwards and bounded externally by steep sea-worn cliffs.\r\nDr. Daubeny supposes “Volcanoes” page 266, that this cavity must have\r\nbeen formed by a circular subsidence. It appears to me far more\r\nprobable, that we here have strata which were originally deposited\r\nwithin the hollow of a crater, of which the exterior walls have since\r\nbeen removed by the sea.)\r\n\r\nJAMES ISLAND.\r\n\r\nTwo craters of tuff on this island are the only remaining ones which\r\nrequire any notice. One of them lies a mile and a half inland from\r\nPuerto Grande: it is circular, about the third of a mile in diameter,\r\nand 400 feet in depth. It differs from all the other tuff-craters which\r\nI examined, in having the lower part of its cavity, to the height of\r\nbetween one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet, formed by a\r\nprecipitous wall of basalt, giving to the crater the appearance of\r\nhaving burst through a solid sheet of rock. The upper part of this\r\ncrater consists of strata of the altered tuff, with a semi-resinous\r\nfracture. Its bottom is occupied by a shallow lake of brine, covering\r\nlayers of salt, which rest on deep black mud. The other crater lies at\r\nthe distance of a few miles, and is only remarkable from its size and\r\nperfect condition. Its summit is 1,200 feet above the level of the sea,\r\nand the interior hollow is 600 feet deep. Its external sloping surface\r\npresented a curious appearance from the smoothness of the wide layers\r\nof tuff, which resembled a vast plastered floor. Brattle Island is, I\r\nbelieve, the largest crater in the Archipelago composed of tuff; its\r\ninterior diameter is nearly a nautical mile. At present it is in a\r\nruined condition, consisting of little more than half a circle open to\r\nthe south; its great size is probably due, in part, to internal\r\ndegradation, from the action of the sea.\r\n\r\nSEGMENT OF A BASALTIC CRATER.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 14. SEGMENT OF A VERY SMALL ORIFICE OF ERUPTION, on the beach\r\nof Fresh-water Bay.)\r\n\r\nOne side of Fresh-water Bay, in James Island, is bounded by a\r\npromontory, which forms the last wreck of a great crater. On the beach\r\nof this promontory, a quadrant-shaped segment of a small subordinate\r\npoint of eruption stands exposed. It consists of nine separate little\r\nstreams of lava piled upon each other; and of an irregular pinnacle,\r\nabout fifteen feet high, of reddish-brown, vesicular basalt, abounding\r\nwith large crystals of glassy albite, and with fused augite. This\r\npinnacle, and some adjoining paps of rock on the beach, represent the\r\naxis of the crater. The streams of lava can be followed up a little\r\nravine, at right angles to the coast, for between ten and fifteen\r\nyards, where they are hidden by detritus: along the beach they are\r\nvisible for nearly eighty yards, and I do not believe that they extend\r\nmuch further. The three lower streams are united to the pinnacle; and\r\nat the point of junction (as shown in Figure 14, a rude sketch made on\r\nthe spot), they are slightly arched, as if in the act of flowing over\r\nthe lip of the crater. The six upper streams no doubt were originally\r\nunited to this same column before it was worn down by the sea. The lava\r\nof these streams is of similar composition with that of the pinnacle,\r\nexcepting that the crystals of albite appear to be more comminuted, and\r\nthe grains of fused augite are absent. Each stream is separated from\r\nthe one above it by a few inches, or at most by one or two feet in\r\nthickness, of loose fragmentary scoriae, apparently derived from the\r\nabrasion of the streams in passing over each other. All these streams\r\nare very remarkable from their thinness. I carefully measured several\r\nof them; one was eight inches thick, but was firmly coated with three\r\ninches above, and three inches below, of red scoriaceous rock (which is\r\nthe case with all the streams), making altogether a thickness of\r\nfourteen inches: this thickness was preserved quite uniformly along the\r\nentire length of the section. A second stream was only eight inches\r\nthick, including both the upper and lower scoriaceous surfaces. Until\r\nexamining this section, I had not thought it possible that lava could\r\nhave flowed in such uniformly thin sheets over a surface far from\r\nsmooth. These little streams closely resemble in composition that great\r\ndeluge of lava at Albemarle Island, which likewise must have possessed\r\na high degree of fluidity.\r\n\r\nPSEUDO-EXTRANEOUS, EJECTED FRAGMENTS.\r\n\r\nIn the lava and in the scoriae of this little crater, I found several\r\nfragments, which, from their angular form, their granular structure,\r\ntheir freedom from air-cells, their brittle and burnt condition,\r\nclosely resembled those fragments of primary rocks which are\r\noccasionally ejected, as at Ascension, from volcanoes. These fragments\r\nconsist of glassy albite, much mackled, and with very imperfect\r\ncleavages, mingled with semi-rounded grains, having tarnished, glossy\r\nsurfaces, of a steel-blue mineral. The crystals of albite are coated by\r\na red oxide of iron, appearing like a residual substance; and their\r\ncleavage-planes also are sometimes separated by excessively fine layers\r\nof this oxide, giving to the crystals the appearance of being ruled\r\nlike a glass micrometer. There was no quartz. The steel-blue mineral,\r\nwhich is abundant in the pinnacle, but which disappears in the streams\r\nderived from the pinnacle, has a fused appearance, and rarely presents\r\neven a trace of cleavage; I obtained, however, one measurement, which\r\nproved that it was augite; and in one other fragment, which differed\r\nfrom the others, in being slightly cellular, and in gradually blending\r\ninto the surrounding matrix the small grains of this mineral were\r\ntolerably well crystallised. Although there is so wide a difference in\r\nappearance between the lava of the little streams, and especially of\r\ntheir red scoriaceous crusts, and one of these angular ejected\r\nfragments, which at first sight might readily be mistaken for syenite,\r\nyet I believe that the lava has originated from the melting and\r\nmovement of a mass of rock of absolutely similar composition with the\r\nfragments. Besides the specimen above alluded to, in which we see a\r\nfragment becoming slightly cellular, and blending into the surrounding\r\nmatrix, some of the grains of the steel-blue augite also have their\r\nsurfaces becoming very finely vesicular, and passing into the nature of\r\nthe surrounding paste; other grains are throughout, in an intermediate\r\ncondition. The paste seems to consist of the augite more perfectly\r\nfused, or, more probably, merely disturbed in its softened state by the\r\nmovement of the mass, and mingled with the oxide of iron and with\r\nfinely comminuted, glassy albite. Hence probably it is that the fused\r\nalbite, which is abundant in the pinnacle, disappears in the streams.\r\nThe albite is in exactly the same state, with the exception of most of\r\nthe crystals being smaller in the lava and in the embedded fragments;\r\nbut in the fragments they appear to be less abundant: this, however,\r\nwould naturally happen from the intumescence of the augitic base, and\r\nits consequent apparent increase in bulk. It is interesting thus to\r\ntrace the steps by which a compact granular rock becomes converted into\r\na vesicular, pseudo-porphyritic lava, and finally into red scoriae. The\r\nstructure and composition of the embedded fragments show that they are\r\nparts either of a mass of primary rock which has undergone considerable\r\nchange from volcanic action, or more probably of the crust of a body of\r\ncooled and crystallised lava, which has afterwards been broken up and\r\nre-liquified; the crust being less acted on by the renewed heat and\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE TUFF-CRATERS.\r\n\r\nThese craters, from the peculiarity of the resin-like substance which\r\nenters largely into their composition, from their structure, their size\r\nand number, present the most striking feature in the geology of this\r\nArchipelago. The majority of them form either separate islets, or\r\npromontories attached to the larger islands; and those which now stand\r\nat some little distance from the coast are worn and breached, as if by\r\nthe action of the sea. From this general circumstance of their\r\nposition, and from the small quantity of ejected ashes in any part of\r\nthe Archipelago, I am led to conclude, that the tuff has been chiefly\r\nproduced, by the grinding together of fragments of lava within active\r\ncraters, communicating with the sea. In the origin and composition of\r\nthe tuff, and in the frequent presence of a central lake of brine and\r\nof layers of salt, these craters resemble, though on a gigantic scale,\r\nthe “salses,” or hillocks of mud, which are common in some parts of\r\nItaly and in other countries. (D’Aubuisson “Traite de Geognosie” tome 1\r\npage 189. I may remark, that I saw at Terceira, in the Azores, a crater\r\nof tuff or peperino, very similar to these of the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago. From the description given in Freycinet “Voyage,” similar\r\nones occur at the Sandwich Islands; and probably they are present in\r\nmany other places.) Their closer connection, however, in this\r\nArchipelago, with ordinary volcanic action, is shown by the pools of\r\nsolidified basalt, with which they are sometimes filled up.\r\n\r\nIt at first appears very singular, that all the craters formed of tuff\r\nhave their southern sides, either quite broken down and wholly removed,\r\nor much lower than the other sides. I saw and received accounts of\r\ntwenty-eight of these craters; of these, twelve form separate islets\r\n(These consist of the three Crossman Islets, the largest of which is\r\n600 feet in height; Enchanted Island; Gardner Island (760 feet high);\r\nChampion Island (331 feet high); Enderby Island; Brattle Island; two\r\nislets near Indefatigable Island; and one near James Island. A second\r\ncrater near James Island (with a salt lake in its centre) has its\r\nsouthern side only about twenty feet high, whilst the other parts of\r\nthe circumference are about three hundred feet in height.), and now\r\nexist as mere crescents quite open to the south, with occasionally a\r\nfew points of rock marking their former circumference: of the remaining\r\nsixteen, some form promontories, and others stand at a little distance\r\ninland from the shore; but all have their southern sides either the\r\nlowest, or quite broken down. Two, however, of the sixteen had their\r\nnorthern sides also low, whilst their eastern and western sides were\r\nperfect. I did not see, or hear of, a single exception to the rule, of\r\nthese craters being broken down or low on the side, which faces a point\r\nof the horizon between S.E. and S.W. This rule does not apply to\r\ncraters composed of lava and scoriae. The explanation is simple: at\r\nthis Archipelago, the waves from the trade-wind, and the swell\r\npropagated from the distant parts of the open ocean, coincide in\r\ndirection (which is not the case in many parts of the Pacific), and\r\nwith their united forces attack the southern sides of all the islands;\r\nand consequently the southern slope, even when entirely formed of hard\r\nbasaltic rock, is invariably steeper than the northern slope. As the\r\ntuff-craters are composed of a soft material, and as probably all, or\r\nnearly all, have at some period stood immersed in the sea, we need not\r\nwonder that they should invariably exhibit on their exposed sides the\r\neffects of this great denuding power. Judging from the worn condition\r\nof many of these craters, it is probable that some have been entirely\r\nwashed away. As there is no reason to suppose, that the craters formed\r\nof scoriae and lava were erupted whilst standing in the sea, we can see\r\nwhy the rule does not apply to them. At Ascension, it was shown that\r\nthe mouths of the craters, which are there all of terrestrial origin,\r\nhave been affected by the trade-wind; and this same power might here,\r\nalso, aid in making the windward and exposed sides of some of the\r\ncraters originally the lowest.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGICAL COMPOSITION OF THE ROCKS.\r\n\r\nIn the northern islands, the basaltic lavas seem generally to contain\r\nmore albite than they do in the southern half of the Archipelago; but\r\nalmost all the streams contain some. The albite is not unfrequently\r\nassociated with olivine. I did not observe in any specimen\r\ndistinguishable crystals of hornblende or augite; I except the fused\r\ngrains in the ejected fragments, and in the pinnacle of the little\r\ncrater, above described. I did not meet with a single specimen of true\r\ntrachyte; though some of the paler lavas, when abounding with large\r\ncrystals of the harsh and glassy albite, resemble in some degree this\r\nrock; but in every case the basis fuses into a black enamel. Beds of\r\nashes and far-ejected scoriae, as previously stated, are almost absent;\r\nnor did I see a fragment of obsidian or of pumice. Von Buch believes\r\nthat the absence of pumice on Mount Etna is consequent on the feldspar\r\nbeing of the Labrador variety (“Description des Isles Canaries” page\r\n328.); if the presence of pumice depends on the constitution of the\r\nfeldspar, it is remarkable, that it should be absent in this\r\narchipelago, and abundant in the Cordillera of South America, in both\r\nof which regions the feldspar is of the albitic variety. Owing to the\r\nabsence of ashes, and the general indecomposable character of the lava\r\nin this Archipelago, the islands are slowly clothed with a poor\r\nvegetation, and the scenery has a desolate and frightful aspect.\r\n\r\nELEVATION OF THE LAND.\r\n\r\nProofs of the rising of the land are scanty and imperfect. At Chatham\r\nIsland, I noticed some great blocks of lava, cemented by calcareous\r\nmatter, containing recent shells; but they occurred at the height of\r\nonly a few feet above high-water mark. One of the officers gave me some\r\nfragments of shells, which he found embedded several hundred feet above\r\nthe sea, in the tuff of two craters, distant from each other. It is\r\npossible, that these fragments may have been carried up to their\r\npresent height in an eruption of mud; but as, in one instance, they\r\nwere associated with broken oyster- shells, almost forming a layer, it\r\nis more probable that the tuff was uplifted with the shells in mass.\r\nThe specimens are so imperfect that they can be recognised only as\r\nbelonging to recent marine genera. On Charles Island, I observed a line\r\nof great rounded blocks, piled on the summit of a vertical cliff, at\r\nthe height of fifteen feet above the line, where the sea now acts\r\nduring the heaviest gales. This appeared, at first, good evidence in\r\nfavour of the elevation of the land; but it was quite deceptive, for I\r\nafterwards saw on an adjoining part of this same coast, and heard from\r\neye- witnesses, that wherever a recent stream of lava forms a smooth\r\ninclined plane, entering the sea, the waves during gales have the power\r\nof ROLLING UP ROUNDED blocks to a great height, above the line of their\r\nordinary action. As the little cliff in the foregoing case is formed by\r\na stream of lava, which, before being worn back, must have entered the\r\nsea with a gently sloping surface, it is possible or rather it is\r\nprobable, that the rounded boulders, now lying on its summit, are\r\nmerely the remnants of those which had been ROLLED UP during storms to\r\ntheir present height.\r\n\r\nDIRECTION OF THE FISSURES OF ERUPTION.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic orifices in this group cannot be considered as\r\nindiscriminately scattered. Three great craters on Albermarle Island\r\nform a well-marked line, extending N.W. by N. and S.E. by S. Narborough\r\nIsland, and the great crater on the rectangular projection of Albemarle\r\nIsland, form a second parallel line. To the east, Hood’s Island, and\r\nthe islands and rocks between it and James Island, form another nearly\r\nparallel line, which, when prolonged, includes Culpepper and Wenman\r\nIslands, lying seventy miles to the north. The other islands lying\r\nfurther eastward, form a less regular fourth line. Several of these\r\nislands, and the vents on Albemarle Island, are so placed, that they\r\nlikewise fall on a set of rudely parallel lines, intersecting the\r\nformer lines at right angles; so that the principal craters appear to\r\nlie on the points where two sets of fissures cross each other. The\r\nislands themselves, with the exception of Albemarle Island, are not\r\nelongated in the same direction with the lines on which they stand. The\r\ndirection of these islands is nearly the same with that which prevails\r\nin so remarkable a manner in the numerous archipelagoes of the great\r\nPacific Ocean. Finally, I may remark, that amongst the Galapagos\r\nIslands there is no one dominant vent much higher than all the others,\r\nas may be observed in many volcanic archipelagoes: the highest is the\r\ngreat mound on the south- western extremity of Albemarle Island, which\r\nexceeds by barely a thousand feet several other neighbouring craters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTRACHYTE AND BASALT.—DISTRIBUTION OF VOLCANIC ISLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sinking of crystals in fluid lava.

Eruptions on parallel lines of\r\nfissure within the same geological period.\r\n\r\nON THE SEPARATION OF THE CONSTITUENT MINERALS OF LAVA, ACCORDING TO\r\nTHEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITIES.\r\n\r\nOne side of Fresh-water Bay, in James Island, is formed by the wreck of\r\na large crater, mentioned in the last chapter, of which the interior\r\nhas been filled up by a pool of basalt, about two hundred feet in\r\nthickness. This basalt is of a grey colour, and contains many crystals\r\nof glassy albite, which become much more numerous in the lower,\r\nscoriaceous part. This is contrary to what might have been expected,\r\nfor if the crystals had been originally disseminated in equal numbers,\r\nthe greater intumescence of this lower scoriaceous part would have made\r\nthem appear fewer in number. Von Buch has described a stream of\r\nobsidian on the Peak of Teneriffe, in which the crystals of feldspar\r\nbecome more and more numerous, as the depth or thickness increases, so\r\nthat near the lower surface of the stream the lava even resembles a\r\nprimary rock. (“Description des Isles Canaries” pages 190 and 191.) Von\r\nBuch further states, that M. Dree, in his experiments in melting lava,\r\nfound that the crystals of feldspar always tended to precipitate\r\nthemselves to the bottom of the crucible. In these cases, I presume\r\nthere can be no doubt that the crystals sink from their weight. (In a\r\nmass of molten iron, it is found (“Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal”\r\nvolume 24 page 66) that the substances, which have a closer affinity\r\nfor oxygen than iron has, rise from the interior of the mass to the\r\nsurface. But a similar cause can hardly apply to the separation of the\r\ncrystals of these lava-streams. The cooling of the surface of lava\r\nseems, in some cases, to have affected its composition; for Dufrenoy\r\n(“Mem. pour servir” tome 4 page 271) found that the interior parts of a\r\nstream near Naples contained two-thirds of a mineral which was acted on\r\nby acids, whilst the surface consisted chiefly of a mineral\r\nunattackable by acids.) The specific gravity of feldspar varies from\r\n2.4 to 2.58, whilst obsidian seems commonly to be from 2.3 to 2.4; and\r\nin a fluidified state its specific gravity would probably be less,\r\nwhich would facilitate the sinking of the crystals of feldspar. (I have\r\ntaken the specific gravities of the simple minerals from Von Kobell,\r\none of the latest and best authorities, and of the rocks from various\r\nauthorities. Obsidian, according to Phillips, is 2.35; and Jameson says\r\nit never exceeds 2.4; but a specimen from Ascension, weighed by myself,\r\nwas 2.42.) At James Island, the crystals of albite, though no doubt of\r\nless weight than the grey basalt, in the parts where compact, might\r\neasily be of greater specific gravity than the scoriaceous mass, formed\r\nof melted lava and bubbles of heated gas.\r\n\r\nThe sinking of crystals through a viscid substance like molten rock, as\r\nis unequivocally shown to have been the case in the experiments of M.\r\nDree, is worthy of further consideration, as throwing light on the\r\nseparation of the trachytic and basaltic series of lavas. Mr. P. Scrope\r\nhas speculated on this subject; but he does not seem to have been aware\r\nof any positive facts, such as those above given; and he has overlooked\r\none very necessary element, as it appears to me, in the\r\nphenomenon—namely, the existence of either the lighter or heavier\r\nmineral in globules or in crystals. In a substance of imperfect\r\nfluidity, like molten rock, it is hardly credible, that the separate,\r\ninfinitely small atoms, whether of feldspar, augite, or of any other\r\nmineral, would have power from their slightly different gravities to\r\novercome the friction caused by their movement; but if the atoms of any\r\none of these minerals became, whilst the others remained fluid, united\r\ninto crystals or granules, it is easy to perceive that from the\r\nlessened friction, their sinking or floating power would be greatly\r\nincreased. On the other hand, if all the minerals became granulated at\r\nthe same time, it is scarcely possible, from their mutual resistance,\r\nthat any separation could take place. A valuable, practical discovery,\r\nillustrating the effect of the granulation of one element in a fluid\r\nmass, in aiding its separation, has lately been made: when lead\r\ncontaining a small proportion of silver, is constantly stirred whilst\r\ncooling, it becomes granulated, and the grains of imperfect crystals of\r\nnearly pure lead sink to the bottom, leaving a residue of melted metal\r\nmuch richer in silver; whereas if the mixture be left undisturbed,\r\nalthough kept fluid for a length of time, the two metals show no signs\r\nof separating. (A full and interesting account of this discovery, by\r\nMr. Pattinson, was read before the British Association in September\r\n1838. In some alloys, according to Turner “Chemistry” page 210, the\r\nheaviest metal sinks, and it appears that this takes place whilst both\r\nmetals are fluid. Where there is a considerable difference in gravity,\r\nas between iron and the slag formed during the fusion of the ore, we\r\nneed not be surprised at the atoms separating, without either substance\r\nbeing granulated.) The sole use of the stirring seems to be, the\r\nformation of detached granules. The specific gravity of silver is 10.4,\r\nand of lead 11.35: the granulated lead, which sinks, is never\r\nabsolutely pure, and the residual fluid metal contains, when richest,\r\nonly 1/119 part of silver. As the difference in specific gravity,\r\ncaused by the different proportions of the two metals, is so\r\nexceedingly small, the separation is probably aided in a great degree\r\nby the difference in gravity between the lead, when granular though\r\nstill hot, and when fluid.\r\n\r\nIn a body of liquified volcanic rock, left for some time without any\r\nviolent disturbance, we might expect, in accordance with the above\r\nfacts, that if one of the constituent minerals became aggregated into\r\ncrystals or granules, or had been enveloped in this state from some\r\npreviously existing mass, such crystals or granules would rise or sink,\r\naccording to their specific gravity. Now we have plain evidence of\r\ncrystals being embedded in many lavas, whilst the paste or basis has\r\ncontinued fluid. I need only refer, as instances, to the several,\r\ngreat, pseudo-porphyritic streams at the Galapagos Islands, and to the\r\ntrachytic streams in many parts of the world, in which we find crystals\r\nof feldspar bent and broken by the movement of the surrounding,\r\nsemi-fluid matter. Lavas are chiefly composed of three varieties of\r\nfeldspar, varying in specific gravity from 2.4 to 2.74; of hornblende\r\nand augite, varying from 3.0 to 3.4; of olivine, varying from 3.3 to\r\n3.4; and lastly, of oxides of iron, with specific gravities from 4.8 to\r\n5.2. Hence crystals of feldspar, enveloped in a mass of liquified, but\r\nnot highly vesicular lava, would tend to rise to the upper parts; and\r\ncrystals or granules of the other minerals, thus enveloped, would tend\r\nto sink. We ought not, however, to expect any perfect degree of\r\nseparation in such viscid materials. Trachyte, which consists chiefly\r\nof feldspar, with some hornblende and oxide of iron, has a specific\r\ngravity of about 2.45; whilst basalt, composed chiefly of augite and\r\nfeldspar, often with much iron and olivine, has a gravity of about 3.0.\r\n(Trachyte from Java was found by Von Buch to be 2.47; from Auvergne, by\r\nDe la Beche, it was 2.42; from Ascension, by myself, it was 2.42.\r\nJameson and other authors give to basalt a specific gravity of 3.0; but\r\nspecimens from Auvergne were found, by De la Beche, to be only 2.78;\r\nand from the Giant’s Causeway, to be 2.91.) Accordingly we find, that\r\nwhere both trachytic and basaltic streams have proceeded from the same\r\norifice, the trachytic streams have generally been first erupted owing,\r\nas we must suppose, to the molten lava of this series having\r\naccumulated in the upper parts of the volcanic focus. This order of\r\neruption has been observed by Beudant, Scrope, and by other authors;\r\nthree instances, also, have been given in this volume. As the later\r\neruptions, however, from most volcanic mountains, burst through their\r\nbasal parts, owing to the increased height and weight of the internal\r\ncolumn of molten rock, we see why, in most cases, only the lower flanks\r\nof the central, trachytic masses, are enveloped by basaltic streams.\r\nThe separation of the ingredients of a mass of lava, would, perhaps,\r\nsometimes take place within the body of a volcanic mountain, if lofty\r\nand of great dimensions, instead of within the underground focus; in\r\nwhich case, trachytic streams might be poured forth, almost\r\ncontemporaneously, or at short recurrent intervals, from its summit,\r\nand basaltic streams from its base: this seems to have taken place at\r\nTeneriffe. (Consult Von Buch’s well-known and admirable “Description\r\nPhysique” of this island, which might serve as a model of descriptive\r\ngeology.) I need only further remark, that from violent disturbances\r\nthe separation of the two series, even under otherwise favourable\r\nconditions, would naturally often be prevented, and likewise their\r\nusual order of eruption be inverted. From the high degree of fluidity\r\nof most basaltic lavas, these perhaps, alone, would in many cases reach\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen that crystals of feldspar, in the instance described by\r\nVon Buch, sink in obsidian, in accordance with their known greater\r\nspecific gravity, we might expect to find in every trachytic district,\r\nwhere obsidian has flowed as lava, that it had proceeded from the upper\r\nor highest orifices. This, according to Von Buch, holds good in a\r\nremarkable manner both at the Lipari Islands and on the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe; at this latter place obsidian has never flowed from a less\r\nheight than 9,200 feet. Obsidian, also, appears to have been erupted\r\nfrom the loftiest peaks of the Peruvian Cordillera. I will only further\r\nobserve, that the specific gravity of quartz varies from 2.6 to 2.8;\r\nand therefore, that when present in a volcanic focus, it would not tend\r\nto sink with the basaltic bases; and this, perhaps, explains the\r\nfrequent presence, and the abundance of this mineral, in the lavas of\r\nthe trachytic series, as observed in previous parts of this volume.\r\n\r\nAn objection to the foregoing theory will, perhaps, be drawn from the\r\nplutonic rocks not being separated into two evidently distinct series,\r\nof different specific gravities; although, like the volcanic, they have\r\nbeen liquified. In answer, it may first be remarked, that we have no\r\nevidence of the atoms of any one of the constituent minerals in the\r\nplutonic series having been aggregated, whilst the others remained\r\nfluid, which we have endeavoured to show is an almost necessary\r\ncondition of their separation; on the contrary, the crystals have\r\ngenerally impressed each other with their forms. (The crystalline paste\r\nof phonolite is frequently penetrated by long needles of hornblende;\r\nfrom which it appears that the hornblende, though the more fusible\r\nmineral, has crystallised before, or at the same time with a more\r\nrefractory substance. Phonolite, as far as my observations serve, in\r\nevery instance appears to be an injected rock, like those of the\r\nplutonic series; hence probably, like these latter, it has generally\r\nbeen cooled without repeated and violent disturbances. Those geologists\r\nwho have doubted whether granite could have been formed by igneous\r\nliquefaction, because minerals of different degrees of fusibility\r\nimpress each other with their forms, could not have been aware of the\r\nfact of crystallised hornblende penetrating phonolite, a rock\r\nundoubtedly of igneous origin. The viscidity, which it is now known,\r\nthat both feldspar and quartz retain at a temperature much below their\r\npoints of fusion, easily explains their mutual impressment. Consult on\r\nthis subject Mr. Horner’s paper on Bonn “Geolog. Transact.” volume 4\r\npage 439; and “L’Institut” with respect to quartz 1839 page 161.)\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the perfect tranquillity, under which it is\r\nprobable that the plutonic masses, buried at profound depths, have\r\ncooled, would, most likely, be highly unfavourable to the separation of\r\ntheir constituent minerals; for, if the attractive force, which during\r\nthe progressive cooling draws together the molecules of the different\r\nminerals, has power sufficient to keep them together, the friction\r\nbetween such half-formed crystals or pasty globules would effectually\r\nprevent the heavier ones from sinking, or the lighter ones from rising.\r\nOn the other hand, a small amount of disturbance, which would probably\r\noccur in most volcanic foci, and which we have seen does not prevent\r\nthe separation of granules of lead from a mixture of molten lead and\r\nsilver, or crystals of feldspar from streams of lava, by breaking and\r\ndissolving the less perfectly formed globules, would permit the more\r\nperfect and therefore unbroken crystals, to sink or rise, according to\r\ntheir specific gravity.\r\n\r\nAlthough in plutonic rocks two distinct species, corresponding to the\r\ntrachytic and basaltic series, do not exist, I much suspect that a\r\ncertain amount of separation of their constituent parts has often taken\r\nplace. I suspect this from having observed how frequently dikes of\r\ngreenstone and basalt intersect widely extended formations of granite\r\nand the allied metamorphic rocks. I have never examined a district in\r\nan extensive granitic region without discovering dikes; I may instance\r\nthe numerous trap-dikes, in several districts of Brazil, Chile, and\r\nAustralia, and at the Cape of Good Hope: many dikes likewise occur in\r\nthe great granitic tracts of India, in the north of Europe, and in\r\nother countries. Whence, then, has the greenstone and basalt, forming\r\nthese dikes, come? Are we to suppose, like some of the elder\r\ngeologists, that a zone of trap is uniformly spread out beneath the\r\ngranitic series, which composes, as far as we know, the foundations of\r\nthe earth’s crust? Is it not more probable, that these dikes have been\r\nformed by fissures penetrating into partially cooled rocks of the\r\ngranitic and metamorphic series, and by their more fluid parts,\r\nconsisting chiefly of hornblende, oozing out, and being sucked into\r\nsuch fissures? At Bahia, in Brazil, in a district composed of gneiss\r\nand primitive greenstone, I saw many dikes, of a dark augitic (for one\r\ncrystal certainly was of this mineral) or hornblendic rock, which, as\r\nseveral appearances clearly proved, either had been formed before the\r\nsurrounding mass had become solid, or had together with it been\r\nafterwards thoroughly softened. (Portions of these dikes have been\r\nbroken off, and are now surrounded by the primary rocks, with their\r\nlaminae conformably winding round them. Dr. Hubbard also (“Silliman’s\r\nJournal” volume 34 page 119), has described an interlacement of\r\ntrap-veins in the granite of the White Mountains, which he thinks must\r\nhave been formed when both rocks were soft.) On both sides of one of\r\nthese dikes, the gneiss was penetrated, to the distance of several\r\nyards, by numerous, curvilinear threads or streaks of dark matter,\r\nwhich resembled in form clouds of the class called cirrhi- comae; some\r\nfew of these threads could be traced to their junction with the dike.\r\nWhen examining them, I doubted whether such hair-like and curvilinear\r\nveins could have been injected, and I now suspect, that instead of\r\nhaving been injected from the dike, they were its feeders. If the\r\nforegoing views of the origin of trap-dikes in widely extended granitic\r\nregions far from rocks of any other formation, be admitted as probable,\r\nwe may further admit, in the case of a great body of plutonic rock,\r\nbeing impelled by repeated movements into the axis of a mountain-chain,\r\nthat its more liquid constituent parts might drain into deep and unseen\r\nabysses; afterwards, perhaps, to be brought to the surface under the\r\nform, either of injected masses of greenstone and augitic porphyry, or\r\nof basaltic eruptions. (Mr. Phillips “Lardner’s Encyclop.” volume 2\r\npage 115 quotes Von Buch’s statement, that augitic porphyry ranges\r\nparallel to, and is found constantly at the base of, great chains of\r\nmountains. Humboldt, also, has remarked the frequent occurrence of\r\ntrap-rock, in a similar position; of which fact I have observed many\r\nexamples at the foot of the Chilian Cordillera. The existence of\r\ngranite in the axes of great mountain chains is always probable, and I\r\nam tempted to suppose, that the laterally injected masses of augitic\r\nporphyry and of trap, bear nearly the same relation to the granitic\r\naxes which basaltic lavas bear to the central trachytic masses, round\r\nthe flanks of which they have so frequently been erupted.) Much of the\r\ndifficulty which geologists have experienced when they have compared\r\nthe composition of volcanic with plutonic formations, will, I think, be\r\nremoved, if we may believe that most plutonic masses have been, to a\r\ncertain extent, drained of those comparatively weighty and easily\r\nliquified elements, which compose the trappean and basaltic series of\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nON THE DISTRIBUTION OF VOLCANIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nDuring my investigations on coral-reefs, I had occasion to consult the\r\nworks of many voyagers, and I was invariably struck with the fact, that\r\nwith rare exceptions, the innumerable islands scattered throughout the\r\nPacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, were composed either of volcanic,\r\nor of modern coral-rocks. It would be tedious to give a long catalogue\r\nof all the volcanic islands; but the exceptions which I have found are\r\neasily enumerated: in the Atlantic, we have St. Paul’s Rock, described\r\nin this volume, and the Falkland Islands, composed of quartz and\r\nclay-slate; but these latter islands are of considerable size, and lie\r\nnot very far from the South American coast (Judging from Forster’s\r\nimperfect observation, perhaps Georgia is not volcanic. Dr. Allan is my\r\ninformant with regard to the Seychelles. I do not know of what\r\nformation Rodriguez, in the Indian Ocean, is composed.): in the Indian\r\nOcean, the Seychelles (situated in a line prolonged from Madagascar)\r\nconsist of granite and quartz: in the Pacific Ocean, New Caledonia, an\r\nisland of large size, belongs (as far as is known) to the primary\r\nclass. New Zealand, which contains much volcanic rock and some active\r\nvolcanoes, from its size cannot be classed with the small islands,\r\nwhich we are now considering. The presence of a small quantity of\r\nnon-volcanic rock, as of clay-slate on three of the Azores (This is\r\nstated on the authority of Count V. de Bedemar, with respect to Flores\r\nand Graciosa (Charlsworth “Magazine of Nat. Hist.” volume 1 page 557).\r\nSt. Maria has no volcanic rock, according to Captain Boyd (Von Buch\r\n“Descript.” page 365). Chatham Island has been described by Dr.\r\nDieffenbach in the “Geographical Journal” 1841 page 201. As yet we have\r\nreceived only imperfect notices on Kerguelen Land, from the Antarctic\r\nExpedition.), or of tertiary limestone at Madeira, or of clay-slate at\r\nChatham Island in the Pacific, or of lignite at Kerguelen Land, ought\r\nnot to exclude such islands or archipelagoes, if formed chiefly of\r\nerupted matter, from the volcanic class.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the numerous islands scattered through the great\r\noceans being with such rare exceptions volcanic, is evidently an\r\nextension of that law, and the effect of those same causes, whether\r\nchemical or mechanical, from which it results, that a vast majority of\r\nthe volcanoes now in action stand either as islands in the sea, or near\r\nits shores. This fact of the ocean-islands being so generally volcanic\r\nis also interesting in relation to the nature of the mountain-chains on\r\nour continents, which are comparatively seldom volcanic; and yet we are\r\nled to suppose that where our continents now stand an ocean once\r\nextended. Do volcanic eruptions, we may ask, reach the surface more\r\nreadily through fissures formed during the first stages of the\r\nconversion of the bed of the ocean into a tract of land?\r\n\r\nLooking at the charts of the numerous volcanic archipelagoes, we see\r\nthat the islands are generally arranged either in single, double, or\r\ntriple rows, in lines which are frequently curved in a slight degree.\r\n(Professors William and Henry Darwin Rogers have lately insisted much,\r\nin a memoir read before the American Association, on the regularly\r\ncurved lines of elevation in parts of the Appalachian range.) Each\r\nseparate island is either rounded, or more generally elongated in the\r\nsame direction with the group in which it stands, but sometimes\r\ntransversely to it. Some of the groups which are not much elongated\r\npresent little symmetry in their forms; M. Virlet (“Bulletin de la Soc.\r\nGeolog.” tome 3 page 110.) states that this is the case with the\r\nGrecian Archipelago: in such groups I suspect (for I am aware how easy\r\nit is to deceive oneself on these points), that the vents are generally\r\narranged on one line, or on a set of short parallel lines, intersecting\r\nat nearly right angles another line, or set of lines. The Galapagos\r\nArchipelago offers an example of this structure, for most of the\r\nislands and the chief orifices on the largest island are so grouped as\r\nto fall on a set of lines ranging about N.W. by N., and on another set\r\nranging about W.S.W.: in the Canary Archipelago we have a simpler\r\nstructure of the same kind: in the Cape de Verde group, which appears\r\nto be the least symmetrical of any oceanic volcanic archipelago, a N.W.\r\nand S.E. line formed by several islands, if prolonged, would intersect\r\nat right angles a curved line, on which the remaining islands are\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nVon Buch (“Description des Isles Canaries” page 324.) has classed all\r\nvolcanoes under two heads, namely, CENTRAL VOLCANOES, round which\r\nnumerous eruptions have taken place on all sides, in a manner almost\r\nregular, and VOLCANIC CHAINS. In the examples given of the first class,\r\nas far as position is concerned, I can see no grounds for their being\r\ncalled “central;” and the evidence of any difference in mineralogical\r\nnature between CENTRAL VOLCANOES and VOLCANIC CHAINS appears slight. No\r\ndoubt some one island in most small volcanic archipelagoes is apt to be\r\nconsiderably higher than the others; and in a similar manner, whatever\r\nthe cause may be, that on the same island one vent is generally higher\r\nthan all the others. Von Buch does not include in his class of volcanic\r\nchains small archipelagoes, in which the islands are admitted by him,\r\nas at the Azores, to be arranged in lines; but when viewing on a map of\r\nthe world how perfect a series exists from a few volcanic islands\r\nplaced in a row to a train of linear archipelagoes following each other\r\nin a straight line, and so on to a great wall like the Cordillera of\r\nAmerica, it is difficult to believe that there exists any essential\r\ndifference between short and long volcanic chains. Von Buch (Idem page\r\n393.) states that his volcanic chains surmount, or are closely\r\nconnected with, mountain-ranges of primary formation: but if trains of\r\nlinear archipelagoes are, in the course of time, by the long- continued\r\naction of the elevatory and volcanic forces, converted into\r\nmountain-ranges, it would naturally result that the inferior primary\r\nrocks would often be uplifted and brought into view.\r\n\r\nSome authors have remarked that volcanic islands occur scattered,\r\nthough at very unequal distances, along the shores of the great\r\ncontinents, as if in some measure connected with them. In the case of\r\nJuan Fernandez, situated 330 miles from the coast of Chile, there was\r\nundoubtedly a connection between the volcanic forces acting under this\r\nisland and under the continent, as was shown during the earthquake of\r\n1835. The islands, moreover, of some of the small volcanic groups which\r\nthus border continents, are placed in lines, related to those along\r\nwhich the adjoining shores of the continents trend; I may instance the\r\nlines of intersection at the Galapagos, and at the Cape de Verde\r\nArchipelagoes, and the best marked line of the Canary Islands. If these\r\nfacts be not merely accidental, we see that many scattered volcanic\r\nislands and small groups are related not only by proximity, but in the\r\ndirection of the fissures of eruption to the neighbouring continents—a\r\nrelation, which Von Buch considers, characteristic of his great\r\nvolcanic chains.\r\n\r\nIn volcanic archipelagoes, the orifices are seldom in activity on more\r\nthan one island at a time; and the greater eruptions usually recur only\r\nafter long intervals. Observing the number of craters, that are usually\r\nfound on each island of a group, and the vast amount of matter which\r\nhas been erupted from them, one is led to attribute a high antiquity\r\neven to those groups, which appear, like the Galapagos, to be of\r\ncomparatively recent origin. This conclusion accords with the\r\nprodigious amount of degradation, by the slow action of the sea, which\r\ntheir originally sloping coasts must have suffered, when they are worn\r\nback, as is so often the case, into grand precipices. We ought not,\r\nhowever, to suppose, in hardly any instance, that the whole body of\r\nmatter, forming a volcanic island, has been erupted at the level, on\r\nwhich it now stands: the number of dikes, which seem invariably to\r\nintersect the interior parts of every volcano, show, on the principles\r\nexplained by M. Elie de Beaumont, that the whole mass has been uplifted\r\nand fissured. A connection, moreover, between volcanic eruptions and\r\ncontemporaneous elevations in mass has, I think, been shown to exist in\r\nmy work on Coral-Reefs, both from the frequent presence of upraised\r\norganic remains, and from the structure of the accompanying\r\ncoral-reefs. (A similar conclusion is forced on us, by the phenomena,\r\nwhich accompanied the earthquake of 1835, at Concepcion, and which are\r\ndetailed in my paper (volume 5 page 601) in the “Geological\r\nTransactions.”) Finally, I may remark, that in the same Archipelago,\r\neruptions have taken place within the historical period on more than\r\none of the parallel lines of fissure: thus, at the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, eruptions have taken place from a vent on Narborough\r\nIsland, and from one on Albemarle Island, which vents do not fall on\r\nthe same line; at the Canary Islands, eruptions have taken place in\r\nTeneriffe and Lanzarote; and at the Azores, on the three parallel lines\r\nof Pico, St. Jorge, and Terceira. Believing that a mountain-axis\r\ndiffers essentially from a volcano, only in plutonic rocks having been\r\ninjected, instead of volcanic matter having been ejected, this appears\r\nto me an interesting circumstance; for we may infer from it as\r\nprobable, that in the elevation of a mountain-chain, two or more of the\r\nparallel lines forming it may be upraised and injected within the same\r\ngeological period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nAUSTRALIA; NEW ZEALAND; CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew South Wales.

In order to\r\nconfine the Third Part of these Geological Observations to South\r\nAmerica, I will here briefly describe all that I observed at these\r\nplaces worthy of the attention of geologists.\r\n\r\nNEW SOUTH WALES.\r\n\r\nMy opportunities of observation consisted of a ride of ninety\r\ngeographical miles to Bathurst, in a W.N.W. direction from Sydney. The\r\nfirst thirty miles from the coast passes over a sandstone country,\r\nbroken up in many places by trap-rocks, and separated by a bold\r\nescarpment overhanging the river Nepean, from the great sandstone\r\nplatform of the Blue Mountains. This upper platform is 1,000 feet high\r\nat the edge of the escarpment, and rises in a distance of twenty-five\r\nmiles to between three and four thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea. At this distance the road descends to a country rather less\r\nelevated, and composed in chief part of primary rocks. There is much\r\ngranite, in one part passing into a red porphyry with octagonal\r\ncrystals of quartz, and intersected in some places by trap-dikes. Near\r\nthe Downs of Bathurst I passed over much pale-brown, glossy clay-slate,\r\nwith the shattered laminae running north and south; I mention this\r\nfact, because Captain King informs me that, in the country a hundred\r\nmiles southward, near Lake George, the mica-slate ranges so invariably\r\nnorth and south that the inhabitants take advantage of it in finding\r\ntheir way through the forests.\r\n\r\nThe sandstone of the Blue Mountains is at least 1,200 feet thick, and\r\nin some parts is apparently of greater thickness; it consists of small\r\ngrains of quartz, cemented by white earthy matter, and it abounds with\r\nferruginous veins. The lower beds sometimes alternate with shales and\r\ncoal: at Wolgan I found in carbonaceous shale leaves of the\r\nGlossopteris Brownii, a fern which so frequently accompanies the coal\r\nof Australia. The sandstone contains pebbles of quartz; and these\r\ngenerally increase in number and size (seldom, however, exceeding an\r\ninch or two in diameter) in the upper beds: I observed a similar\r\ncircumstance in the grand sandstone formation at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nOn the South American coast, where tertiary and supra- tertiary beds\r\nhave been extensively elevated, I repeatedly noticed that the uppermost\r\nbeds were formed of coarser materials than the lower: this appears to\r\nindicate that, as the sea became shallower, the force of the waves or\r\ncurrents increased. On the lower platform, however, between the Blue\r\nMountains and the coast, I observed that the upper beds of the\r\nsandstone frequently passed into argillaceous shale,—the effect,\r\nprobably, of this lower space having been protected from strong\r\ncurrents during its elevation. The sandstone of the Blue Mountains\r\nevidently having been of mechanical origin, and not having suffered any\r\nmetamorphic action, I was surprised at observing that, in some\r\nspecimens, nearly all the grains of quartz were so perfectly\r\ncrystallised with brilliant facets that they evidently had not in their\r\nPRESENT form been aggregated in any previously existing rock. (I have\r\nlately seen, in a paper by Smith (the father of English geologists), in\r\nthe “Magazine of Natural History,” that the grains of quartz in the\r\nmillstone grit of England are often crystallised. Sir David Brewster,\r\nin a paper read before the British Association, 1840, states, that in\r\nold decomposed glass, the silex and metals separate into concentric\r\nrings, and that the silex regains its crystalline structure, as is\r\nshown by its action on light.) It is difficult to imagine how these\r\ncrystals could have been formed; one can hardly believe that they were\r\nseparately precipitated in their present crystallised state. Is it\r\npossible that rounded grains of quartz may have been acted on by a\r\nfluid corroding their surfaces, and depositing on them fresh silica? I\r\nmay remark that, in the sandstone formation of the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nit is evident that silica has been profusely deposited from aqueous\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of the sandstone I noticed patches of shale which\r\nmight at the first glance have been mistaken for extraneous fragments;\r\ntheir horizontal laminae, however, being parallel with those of the\r\nsandstone, showed that they were the remnants of thin, continuous beds.\r\nOne such fragment (probably the section of a long narrow strip) seen in\r\nthe face of a cliff, was of greater vertical thickness than breadth,\r\nwhich proves that this bed of shale must have been in some slight\r\ndegree consolidated, after having been deposited, and before being worn\r\naway by the currents. Each patch of the shale shows, also, how slowly\r\nmany of the successive layers of sandstone were deposited. These\r\npseudo-fragments of shale will perhaps explain, in some cases, the\r\norigin of apparently extraneous fragments in crystalline metamorphic\r\nrocks. I mention this, because I found near Rio de Janeiro a\r\nwell-defined angular fragment, seven yards long by two yards in\r\nbreadth, of gneiss containing garnets and mica in layers, enclosed in\r\nthe ordinary, stratified, porphyritic gneiss of the country. The\r\nlaminae of the fragment and of the surrounding matrix ran in exactly\r\nthe same direction, but they dipped at different angles. I do not wish\r\nto affirm that this singular fragment (a solitary case, as far as I\r\nknow) was originally deposited in a layer, like the shale in the Blue\r\nMountains, between the strata of the porphyritic gneiss, before they\r\nwere metamorphosed; but there is sufficient analogy between the two\r\ncases to render such an explanation possible.\r\n\r\nSTRATIFICATION OF THE ESCARPMENT.\r\n\r\nThe strata of the Blue Mountains appear to the eye horizontal; but they\r\nprobably have a similar inclination with the surface of the platform,\r\nwhich slopes from the west towards the escarpment over the Nepean, at\r\nan angle of one degree, or of one hundred feet in a mile. (This is\r\nstated on the authority of Sir T. Mitchell in “Travels” volume 2 page\r\n357.) The strata of the escarpment dip almost conformably with its\r\nsteeply inclined face, and with so much regularity, that they appear as\r\nif thrown into their present position; but on a more careful\r\nexamination, they are seen to thicken and to thin out, and in the upper\r\npart to be succeeded and almost capped by horizontal beds. These\r\nappearances render it probable, that we here see an original\r\nescarpment, not formed by the sea having eaten back into the strata,\r\nbut by the strata having originally extended only thus far. Those who\r\nhave been in the habit of examining accurate charts of sea-coasts,\r\nwhere sediment is accumulating, will be aware, that the surfaces of the\r\nbanks thus formed, generally slope from the coast very gently towards a\r\ncertain line in the offing, beyond which the depth in most cases\r\nsuddenly becomes great. I may instance the great banks of sediment\r\nwithin the West Indian Archipelago (I have described these very curious\r\nbanks in the Appendix to my volume on the structure of Coral-Reefs. I\r\nhave ascertained the inclination of the edges of the banks, from\r\ninformation given me by Captain B. Allen, one of the surveyors, and by\r\ncarefully measuring the horizontal distances between the last sounding\r\non the bank and the first in the deep water. Widely extended banks in\r\nall parts of the West Indies have the same general form of surface.),\r\nwhich terminate in submarine slopes, inclined at angles of between\r\nthirty and forty degrees, and sometimes even at more than forty\r\ndegrees: every one knows how steep such a slope would appear on the\r\nland. Banks of this nature, if uplifted, would probably have nearly the\r\nsame external form as the platform of the Blue Mountains, where it\r\nabruptly terminates over the Nepean.\r\n\r\nCURRENT-CLEAVAGE.\r\n\r\nThe strata of sandstone in the low coast country, and likewise on the\r\nBlue Mountains, are often divided by cross or current laminae, which\r\ndip in different directions, and frequently at an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees. Most authors have attributed these cross layers to successive\r\nsmall accumulations on an inclined surface; but from a careful\r\nexamination in some parts of the New Red Sandstone of England, I\r\nbelieve that such layers generally form parts of a series of curves,\r\nlike gigantic tidal ripples, the tops of which have since been cut off,\r\neither by nearly horizontal layers, or by another set of great ripples,\r\nthe folds of which do not exactly coincide with those below them. It is\r\nwell-known to surveyors that mud and sand are disturbed during storms\r\nat considerable depths, at least from three hundred to four hundred and\r\nfifty feet (See Martin White on “Soundings in the British Channel”\r\npages 4 and 166.), so that the nature of the bottom even becomes\r\ntemporarily changed; the bottom, also, at a depth between sixty and\r\nseventy feet, has been observed to be broadly rippled. (M. Siau on the\r\n“Action of Waves” “Edin. New Phil. Journ.” volume 31 page 245.) One\r\nmay, therefore, be allowed to suspect, from the appearance just\r\nmentioned in the New Red Sandstone, that at greater depths, the bed of\r\nthe ocean is heaped up during gales into great ripple-like furrows and\r\ndepressions, which are afterwards cut off by the currents during more\r\ntranquil weather, and again furrowed during gales.\r\n\r\nVALLEYS IN THE SANDSTONE PLATFORMS.\r\n\r\nThe grand valleys, by which the Blue Mountains and the other sandstone\r\nplatforms of this part of Australia are penetrated, and which long\r\noffered an insuperable obstacle to the attempts of the most\r\nenterprising colonist to reach the interior country, form the most\r\nstriking feature in the geology of New South Wales. They are of grand\r\ndimensions, and are bordered by continuous links of lofty cliffs. It is\r\nnot easy to conceive a more magnificent spectacle, than is presented to\r\na person walking on the summit- plains, when without any notice he\r\narrives at the brink of one of these cliffs, which are so\r\nperpendicular, that he can strike with a stone (as I have tried) the\r\ntrees growing, at the depth of between one thousand and one thousand\r\nfive hundred feet below him; on both hands he sees headland beyond\r\nheadland of the receding line of cliff, and on the opposite side of the\r\nvalley, often at the distance of several miles, he beholds another line\r\nrising up to the same height with that on which he stands, and formed\r\nof the same horizontal strata of pale sandstone. The bottoms of these\r\nvalleys are moderately level, and the fall of the rivers flowing in\r\nthem, according to Sir T. Mitchell, is gentle. The main valleys often\r\nsend into the platform great baylike arms, which expand at their upper\r\nends; and on the other hand, the platform often sends promontories into\r\nthe valley, and even leaves in them great, almost insulated, masses. So\r\ncontinuous are the bounding lines of cliff, that to descend into some\r\nof these valleys, it is necessary to go round twenty miles; and into\r\nothers, the surveyors have only lately penetrated, and the colonists\r\nhave not yet been able to drive in their cattle. But the most\r\nremarkable point of structure in these valleys, is, that although\r\nseveral miles wide in their upper parts, they generally contract\r\ntowards their mouths to such a degree as to become impassable. The\r\nSurveyor-General, Sir T. Mitchell, in vain endeavoured, first on foot\r\nand then by crawling between the great fallen fragments of sandstone,\r\nto ascend through the gorge by which the river Grose joins the Nepean\r\n(“Travels in Australia” volume 1 page 154.—I must express my obligation\r\nto Sir T. Mitchell for several interesting personal communications on\r\nthe subject of these great valleys of New South Wales.); yet the valley\r\nof the Grose in its upper part, as I saw, forms a magnificent basin\r\nsome miles in width, and is on all sides surrounded by cliffs, the\r\nsummits of which are believed to be nowhere less than 3,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea. When cattle are driven into the valley of the\r\nWolgan by a path (which I descended) partly cut by the colonists, they\r\ncannot escape; for this valley is in every other part surrounded by\r\nperpendicular cliffs, and eight miles lower down, it contracts, from an\r\naverage width of half a mile, to a mere chasm impassable to man or\r\nbeast. Sir T. Mitchell states, that the great valley of the Cox river\r\nwith all its branches contracts, where it unites with the Nepean, into\r\na gorge 2,200 yards wide, and about one thousand feet in depth. (Idem\r\nvolume 2 page 358.) Other similar cases might have been added.\r\n\r\nThe first impression, from seeing the correspondence of the horizontal\r\nstrata, on each side of these valleys and great amphitheatre-like\r\ndepressions, is that they have been in chief part hollowed out, like\r\nother valleys, by aqueous erosion; but when one reflects on the\r\nenormous amount of stone, which on this view must have been removed, in\r\nmost of the above cases through mere gorges or chasms, one is led to\r\nask whether these spaces may not have subsided. But considering the\r\nform of the irregularly branching valleys, and of the narrow\r\npromontories, projecting into them from the platforms, we are compelled\r\nto abandon this notion. To attribute these hollows to alluvial action,\r\nwould be preposterous; nor does the drainage from the summit-level\r\nalways fall, as I remarked near the Weatherboard, into the head of\r\nthese valleys, but into one side of their bay-like recesses. Some of\r\nthe inhabitants remarked to me, that they never viewed one of these\r\nbaylike recesses, with the headlands receding on both hands, without\r\nbeing struck with their resemblance to a bold sea-coast. This is\r\ncertainly the case; moreover, the numerous fine harbours, with their\r\nwidely branching arms, on the present coast of New South Wales, which\r\nare generally connected with the sea by a narrow mouth, from one mile\r\nto a quarter of a mile in width, passing through the sandstone\r\ncoast-cliffs, present a likeness, though on a miniature scale, to the\r\ngreat valleys of the interior. But then immediately occurs the\r\nstartling difficulty, why has the sea worn out these great, though\r\ncircumscribed, depressions on a wide platform, and left mere gorges,\r\nthrough which the whole vast amount of triturated matter must have been\r\ncarried away? The only light I can throw on this enigma, is by showing\r\nthat banks appear to be forming in some seas of the most irregular\r\nforms, and that the sides of such banks are so steep (as before stated)\r\nthat a comparatively small amount of subsequent erosion would form them\r\ninto cliffs: that the waves have power to form high and precipitous\r\ncliffs, even in landlocked harbours, I have observed in many parts of\r\nSouth America. In the Red Sea, banks with an extremely irregular\r\noutline and composed of sediment, are penetrated by the most singularly\r\nshaped creeks with narrow mouths: this is likewise the case, though on\r\na larger scale, with the Bahama Banks. Such banks, I have been led to\r\nsuppose, have been formed by currents heaping sediment on an irregular\r\nbottom. (See the “Appendix” to the Part on Coral-Reefs. The fact of the\r\nsea heaping up mud round a submarine nucleus, is worthy of the notice\r\nof geologists: for outlyers of the same composition with the coast\r\nbanks are thus formed; and these, if upheaved and worn into cliffs,\r\nwould naturally be thought to have been once connected together.) That\r\nin some cases, the sea, instead of spreading out sediment in a uniform\r\nsheet, heaps it round submarine rocks and islands, it is hardly\r\npossible to doubt, after having examined the charts of the West Indies.\r\nTo apply these ideas to the sandstone platforms of New South Wales, I\r\nimagine that the strata might have been heaped on an irregular bottom\r\nby the action of strong currents, and of the undulations of an open\r\nsea; and that the valley-like spaces thus left unfilled might, during a\r\nslow elevation of the land, have had their steeply sloping flanks worn\r\ninto cliffs; the worn-down sandstone being removed, either at the time\r\nwhen the narrow gorges were cut by the retreating sea, or subsequently\r\nby alluvial action.\r\n\r\nVAN DIEMEN’S LAND.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of this island is mainly formed of mountains of\r\ngreenstone, which often assumes a syenitic character, and contains much\r\nhypersthene. These mountains, in their lower half, are generally\r\nencased by strata containing numerous small corals and some shells.\r\nThese shells have been examined by Mr. G.B. Sowerby, and have been\r\ndescribed by him: they consist of two species of Producta, and of six\r\nof Spirifera; two of these, namely, P. rugata and S. rotundata,\r\nresemble, as far as their imperfect condition allows of comparison,\r\nBritish mountain-limestone shells. Mr. Lonsdale has had the kindness to\r\nexamine the corals; they consist of six undescribed species, belonging\r\nto three genera. Species of these genera occur in the Silurian,\r\nDevonian, and Carboniferous strata of Europe. Mr. Lonsdale remarks,\r\nthat all these fossils have undoubtedly a Palaeozoic character, and\r\nthat probably they correspond in age to a division of the system above\r\nthe Silurian formations.\r\n\r\nThe strata containing these remains are singular from the extreme\r\nvariability of their mineralogical composition. Every intermediate form\r\nis present, between flinty-slate, clay-slate passing into grey wacke,\r\npure limestone, sandstone, and porcellanic rock; and some of the beds\r\ncan only be described as composed of a siliceo-calcareo-clay-slate. The\r\nformation, as far as I could judge, is at least a thousand feet in\r\nthickness: the upper few hundred feet usually consist of a siliceous\r\nsandstone, containing pebbles and no organic remains; the inferior\r\nstrata, of which a pale flinty slate is perhaps the most abundant, are\r\nthe most variable; and these chiefly abound with the remains. Between\r\ntwo beds of hard crystalline limestone, near Newtown, a layer of white\r\nsoft calcareous matter is quarried, and is used for whitewashing\r\nhouses. From information given to me by Mr. Frankland, the\r\nSurveyor-General, it appears that this Palaeozoic formation is found in\r\ndifferent parts of the whole island; from the same authority, I may\r\nadd, that on the north-eastern coast and in Bass’ Straits primary rocks\r\nextensively occur.\r\n\r\nThe shores of Storm Bay are skirted, to the height of a few hundred\r\nfeet, by strata of sandstone, containing pebbles of the formation just\r\ndescribed, with its characteristic fossils, and therefore belonging to\r\na subsequent age. These strata of sandstone often pass into shale, and\r\nalternate with layers of impure coal; they have in many places been\r\nviolently disturbed. Near Hobart Town, I observed one dike, nearly a\r\nhundred yards in width, on one side of which the strata were tilted at\r\nan angle of 60 degrees, and on the other they were in some parts\r\nvertical, and had been altered by the effects of the heat. On the west\r\nside of Storm Bay, I found these strata capped by streams of basaltic\r\nlava with olivine; and close by there was a mass of brecciated scoriae,\r\ncontaining pebbles of lava, which probably marks the place of an\r\nancient submarine crater. Two of these streams of basalt were separated\r\nfrom each other by a layer of argillaceous wacke, which could be traced\r\npassing into partially altered scoriae. The wacke contained numerous\r\nrounded grains of a soft, grass-green mineral, with a waxy lustre, and\r\ntranslucent on its edges: under the blowpipe it instantly blackened,\r\nand the points fused into a strongly magnetic, black enamel. In these\r\ncharacters, it resembles those masses of decomposed olivine, described\r\nat St. Jago in the Cape de Verde group; and I should have thought that\r\nit had thus originated, had I not found a similar substance, in\r\ncylindrical threads, within the cells of the vesicular basalt,—a state\r\nunder which olivine never appears; this substance, I believe, would be\r\nclassed as bole by mineralogists. (Chlorophaeite, described by Dr.\r\nMacCulloch (“Western Islands” volume 1 page 504) as occurring in a\r\nbasaltic amygdaloid, differs from this substance, in remaining\r\nunchanged before the blowpipe, and in blackening from exposure to the\r\nair. May we suppose that olivine, in undergoing the remarkable change\r\ndescribed at St. Jago, passes through several states?)\r\n\r\nTRAVERTIN WITH EXTINCT PLANTS.\r\n\r\nBehind Hobart Town there is a small quarry of a hard travertin, the\r\nlower strata of which abound with distinct impressions of leaves. Mr.\r\nRobert Brown has had the kindness to look at my specimens, and he\r\ninformed me that there are four or five kinds, none of which he\r\nrecognises as belonging to existing species. The most remarkable leaf\r\nis palmate, like that of a fan- palm, and no plant having leaves of\r\nthis structure has hitherto been discovered in Van Diemen’s Land. The\r\nother leaves do not resemble the most usual form of the Eucalyptus (of\r\nwhich tribe the existing forests are chiefly composed), nor do they\r\nresemble that class of exceptions to the common form of the leaves of\r\nthe Eucalyptus, which occur in this island. The travertin containing\r\nthis remnant of a lost vegetation, is of a pale yellow colour, hard,\r\nand in parts even crystalline; but not compact, and is everywhere\r\npenetrated by minute, tortuous, cylindrical pores. It contains a very\r\nfew pebbles of quartz, and occasionally layers of chalcedonic nodules,\r\nlike those of chert in our Greensand. From the pureness of this\r\ncalcareous rock, it has been searched for in other places, but has\r\nnever been found. From this circumstance, and from the character of the\r\ndeposit, it was probably formed by a calcareous spring entering a small\r\npool or narrow creek. The strata have subsequently been tilted and\r\nfissured; and the surface has been covered by a singular mass, with\r\nwhich, also, a large fissure has been filled up, formed of balls of\r\ntrap embedded in a mixture of wacke and a white, earthy,\r\nalumino-calcareous substance. Hence it would appear, as if a volcanic\r\neruption had taken place on the borders of the pool, in which the\r\ncalcareous matter was depositing, and had broken it up and drained it.\r\n\r\nELEVATION OF THE LAND.\r\n\r\nBoth the eastern and western shores of the bay, in the neighbourhood of\r\nHobart Town, are in most parts covered to the height of thirty feet\r\nabove the level of high-water mark, with broken shells, mingled with\r\npebbles. The colonists attribute these shells to the aborigines having\r\ncarried them up for food: undoubtedly, there are many large mounds, as\r\nwas pointed out to me by Mr. Frankland, which have been thus formed;\r\nbut I think from the numbers of the shells, from their frequent small\r\nsize, from the manner in which they are thinly scattered, and from some\r\nappearances in the form of the land, that we must attribute the\r\npresence of the greater number to a small elevation of the land. On the\r\nshore of Ralph Bay (opening into Storm Bay) I observed a continuous\r\nbeach about fifteen feet above high-water mark, clothed with\r\nvegetation, and by digging into it, pebbles encrusted with Serpulae\r\nwere found: along the banks, also, of the river Derwent, I found a bed\r\nof broken sea-shells above the surface of the river, and at a point\r\nwhere the water is now much too fresh for sea-shells to live; but in\r\nboth these cases, it is just possible, that before certain spits of\r\nsand and banks of mud in Storm Bay were accumulated, the tides might\r\nhave risen to the height where we now find the shells. ( It would\r\nappear that some changes are now in progress in Ralph Bay, for I was\r\nassured by an intelligent farmer, that oysters were formerly abundant\r\nin it, but that about the year 1834 they had, without any apparent\r\ncause, disappeared. In the “Transactions of the Maryland Academy”\r\nvolume 1 part 1 page 28 there is an account by Mr. Ducatel of vast beds\r\nof oysters and clams having been destroyed by the gradual filling up of\r\nthe shallow lagoons and channels, on the shores of the southern United\r\nStates. At Chiloe, in South America, I heard of a similar loss,\r\nsustained by the inhabitants, in the disappearance from one part of the\r\ncoast of an edible species of Ascidia.)\r\n\r\nEvidence more or less distinct of a change of level between the land\r\nand water, has been detected on almost all the land on this side of the\r\nglobe. Captain Grey, and other travellers, have found in Southern\r\nAustralia upraised shells, belonging either to the recent, or to a late\r\ntertiary period. The French naturalists in Baudin’s expedition, found\r\nshells similarly circumstanced on the S.W. coast of Australia. The Rev.\r\nW.B. Clarke finds proofs of the elevation of the land, to the amount of\r\n400 feet, at the Cape of Good Hope. (“Proceedings of the Geological\r\nSociety” volume 3 page 420.) In the neighbourhood of the Bay of Islands\r\nin New Zealand, I observed that the shores were scattered to some\r\nheight, as at Van Diemen’s Land, with sea-shells, which the colonists\r\nattribute to the natives. (I will here give a catalogue of the rocks\r\nwhich I met with near the Bay of Islands, in New Zealand:—1st, Much\r\nbasaltic lava, and scoriform rocks, forming distinct craters;—2nd, A\r\ncastellated hill of horizontal strata of flesh-coloured limestone,\r\nshowing when fractured distinct crystalline facets: the rain has acted\r\non this rock in a remarkable manner, corroding its surface into a\r\nminiature model of an Alpine country: I observed here layers of chert\r\nand clay ironstone; and in the bed of a stream, pebbles of\r\nclay-slate;—3rd, The shores of the Bay of Islands are formed of a\r\nfeldspathic rock, of a bluish-grey colour, often much decomposed, with\r\nan angular fracture, and crossed by numerous ferruginous seams, but\r\nwithout any distinct stratification or cleavage. Some varieties are\r\nhighly crystalline, and would at once be pronounced to be trap; others\r\nstrikingly resembled clay-slate, slightly altered by heat: I was unable\r\nto form any decided opinion on this formation.) Whatever may have been\r\nthe origin of these shells, I cannot doubt, after having seen a section\r\nof the valley of the Thames River (37 degrees S.), drawn by the Rev. W.\r\nWilliams, that the land has been there elevated: on the opposite sides\r\nof this great valley, three step-like terraces, composed of an enormous\r\naccumulation of rounded pebbles, exactly correspond with each other:\r\nthe escarpment of each terrace is about fifty feet in height. No one\r\nafter having examined the terraces in the valleys on the western shores\r\nof South America, which are strewed with sea-shells, and have been\r\nformed during intervals of rest in the slow elevation of the land,\r\ncould doubt that the New Zealand terraces have been similarly formed. I\r\nmay add, that Dr. Dieffenbach, in his description of the Chatham\r\nIslands (“Geographical Journal” volume 11 pages 202, 205.) (S.W. of New\r\nZealand), states that it is manifest “that the sea has left many places\r\nbare which were once covered by its waters.”\r\n\r\nKING GEORGE’S SOUND.\r\n\r\nThis settlement is situated at the south-western angle of the\r\nAustralian continent: the whole country is granitic, with the\r\nconstituent minerals sometimes obscurely arranged in straight or curved\r\nlaminae. In these cases, the rock would be called by Humboldt,\r\ngneiss-granite, and it is remarkable that the form of the bare conical\r\nhills, appearing to be composed of great folding layers, strikingly\r\nresembles, on a small scale, those composed of gneiss-granite at Rio de\r\nJaneiro, and those described by Humboldt at Venezuela. These plutonic\r\nrocks are, in many places, intersected by trappean-dikes; in one place,\r\nI found ten parallel dikes ranging in an E. and W. line; and not far\r\noff another set of eight dikes, composed of a different variety of\r\ntrap, ranging at right angles to the former ones. I have observed in\r\nseveral primary districts, the occurrence of systems of dikes parallel\r\nand close to each other.\r\n\r\nSUPERFICIAL FERRUGINOUS BEDS.\r\n\r\nThe lower parts of the country are everywhere covered by a bed,\r\nfollowing the inequalities of the surface, of a honeycombed sandstone,\r\nabounding with oxides of iron. Beds of nearly similar composition are\r\ncommon, I believe, along the whole western coast of Australia, and on\r\nmany of the East Indian islands. At the Cape of Good Hope, at the base\r\nof the mountains formed of granite and capped with sandstone, the\r\nground is everywhere coated either by a fine-grained, rubbly,\r\nochraceous mass, like that at King George’s Sound, or by a coarser\r\nsandstone with fragments of quartz, and rendered hard and heavy by an\r\nabundance of the hydrate of iron, which presents, when freshly broken,\r\na metallic lustre. Both these varieties have a very irregular texture,\r\nincluding spaces either rounded or angular, full of loose sand: from\r\nthis cause the surface is always honeycombed. The oxide of iron is most\r\nabundant on the edges of the cavities, where alone it affords a\r\nmetallic fracture. In these formations, as well as in many true\r\nsedimentary deposits, it is evident that iron tends to become\r\naggregated, either in the form of a shell, or of a network. The origin\r\nof these superficial beds, though sufficiently obscure, seems to be due\r\nto alluvial action on detritus abounding with iron.\r\n\r\nSUPERFICIAL CALCAREOUS DEPOSIT.\r\n\r\nA calcareous deposit on the summit of Bald Head, containing branched\r\nbodies, supposed by some authors to have been corals, has been\r\ncelebrated by the descriptions of many distinguished voyagers. (I\r\nvisited this hill, in company with Captain Fitzroy, and we came to a\r\nsimilar conclusion regarding these branching bodies.) It folds round\r\nand conceals irregular hummocks of granite, at the height of 600 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. It varies much in thickness; where\r\nstratified, the beds are often inclined at high angles, even as much as\r\nat thirty degrees, and they dip in all directions. These beds are\r\nsometimes crossed by oblique and even-sided laminae. The deposit\r\nconsists either of a fine, white calcareous powder, in which not a\r\ntrace of structure can be discovered, or of exceedingly minute, rounded\r\ngrains, of brown, yellowish, and purplish colours; both varieties being\r\ngenerally, but not always, mixed with small particles of quartz, and\r\nbeing cemented into a more or less perfect stone. The rounded\r\ncalcareous grains, when heated in a slight degree, instantly lose their\r\ncolours; in this and in every other respect, closely resembling those\r\nminute, equal- sized particles of shells and corals, which at St.\r\nHelena have been drifted up the side of the mountains, and have thus\r\nbeen winnowed of all coarser fragments. I cannot doubt that the\r\ncoloured calcareous particles here have had a similar origin. The\r\nimpalpable powder has probably been derived from the decay of the\r\nrounded particles; this certainly is possible, for on the coast of\r\nPeru, I have traced LARGE UNBROKEN shells gradually falling into a\r\nsubstance as fine as powdered chalk. Both of the above-mentioned\r\nvarieties of calcareous sandstone frequently alternate with, and blend\r\ninto, thin layers of a hard substalagmitic rock, which, even when the\r\nstone on each side contains particles of quartz, is entirely free from\r\nthem (I adopt this term from Lieutenant Nelson’s excellent paper on the\r\nBermuda Islands “Geolog. Trans.” volume 5 page 106, for the hard,\r\ncompact, cream- or brown- coloured stone, without any crystalline\r\nstructure, which so often accompanies superficial calcareous\r\naccumulations. I have observed such superficial beds, coated with\r\nsubstalagmitic rock, at the Cape of Good Hope, in several parts of\r\nChile, and over wide spaces in La Plata and Patagonia. Some of these\r\nbeds have been formed from decayed shells, but the origin of the\r\ngreater number is sufficiently obscure. The causes which determine\r\nwater to dissolve lime, and then soon to redeposit it, are not, I\r\nthink, known. The surface of the substalagmitic layers appears always\r\nto be corroded by the rain-water. As all the above-mentioned countries\r\nhave a long dry season, compared with the rainy one, I should have\r\nthought that the presence of the substalagmitic was connected with the\r\nclimate, had not Lieutenant Nelson found this substance forming under\r\nsea-water. Disintegrated shell seems to be extremely soluble; of which\r\nI found good evidence, in a curious rock at Coquimbo in Chile, which\r\nconsisted of small, pellucid, empty husks, cemented together. A series\r\nof specimens clearly showed that these husks had originally contained\r\nsmall rounded particles of shells, which had been enveloped and\r\ncemented together by calcareous matter (as often happens on\r\nsea-beaches), and which subsequently had decayed, and been dissolved by\r\nwater, that must have penetrated through the calcareous husks, without\r\ncorroding them,—of which processes every stage could be seen.): hence\r\nwe must suppose that these layers, as well as certain vein- like\r\nmasses, have been formed by rain dissolving the calcareous matter and\r\nre-precipitating it, as has happened at St. Helena. Each layer probably\r\nmarks a fresh surface, when the, now firmly cemented, particles existed\r\nas loose sand. These layers are sometimes brecciated and re-cemented,\r\nas if they had been broken by the slipping of the sand when soft. I did\r\nnot find a single fragment of a sea-shell; but bleached shells of the\r\nHelix melo, an existing land species, abound in all the strata; and I\r\nlikewise found another Helix, and the case of an Oniscus.\r\n\r\nThe branches are absolutely undistinguishable in shape from the broken\r\nand upright stumps of a thicket; their roots are often uncovered, and\r\nare seen to diverge on all sides; here and there a branch lies\r\nprostrate. The branches generally consist of the sandstone, rather\r\nfirmer than the surrounding matter, with the central parts filled,\r\neither with friable, calcareous matter, or with a substalagmitic\r\nvariety; this central part is also frequently penetrated by linear\r\ncrevices, sometimes, though rarely, containing a trace of woody matter.\r\nThese calcareous, branching bodies, appear to have been formed by fine\r\ncalcareous matter being washed into the casts or cavities, left by the\r\ndecay of branches and roots of thickets, buried under drifted sand. The\r\nwhole surface of the hill is now undergoing disintegration, and hence\r\nthe casts, which are compact and hard, are left projecting. In\r\ncalcareous sand at the Cape of Good Hope, I found the casts, described\r\nby Abel, quite similar to these at Bald Head; but their centres are\r\noften filled with black carbonaceous matter not yet removed. It is not\r\nsurprising, that the woody matter should have been almost entirely\r\nremoved from the casts on Bald Head; for it is certain, that many\r\ncenturies must have elapsed since the thickets were buried; at present,\r\nowing to the form and height of the narrow promontory, no sand is\r\ndrifted up, and the whole surface, as I have remarked, is wearing away.\r\nWe must, therefore, look back to a period when the land stood lower, of\r\nwhich the French naturalists (See M. Peron “Voyage” tome 1 page 204.)\r\nfound evidence in upraised shells of recent species, for the drifting\r\non Bald Head of the calcareous and quartzose sand, and the consequent\r\nembedment of the vegetable remains. There was only one appearance which\r\nat first made me doubt concerning the origin of the cast,—namely, that\r\nthe finer roots from different stems sometimes became united together\r\ninto upright plates or veins; but when the manner is borne in mind in\r\nwhich fine roots often fill up cracks in hard earth, and that these\r\nroots would decay and leave hollows, as well as the stems, there is no\r\nreal difficulty in this case. Besides the calcareous branches from the\r\nCape of Good Hope, I have seen casts, of exactly the same forms, from\r\nMadeira* and from Bermuda; at this latter place, the surrounding\r\ncalcareous rocks, judging from the specimens collected by Lieutenant\r\nNelson, are likewise similar, as is their subaerial formation.\r\nReflecting on the stratification of the deposit on Bald Head,—on the\r\nirregularly alternating layers of substalagmitic rock,—on the uniformly\r\nsized, and rounded particles, apparently of sea-shells and corals,—on\r\nthe abundance of land-shells throughout the mass,—and finally, on the\r\nabsolute resemblance of the calcareous casts, to the stumps, roots, and\r\nbranches of that kind of vegetation, which would grow on sand-hillocks,\r\nI think there can be no reasonable doubt, notwithstanding the different\r\nopinion of some authors, that a true view of their origin has been here\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n*(Dr. J. Macaulay has fully described (“Edinb. New Phil. Journ.” volume\r\n29 page 350) the casts from Madeira. He considers (differently from Mr.\r\nSmith of Jordan Hill) these bodies to be corals, and the calcareous\r\ndeposit to be of subaqueous origin. His arguments chiefly rest (for his\r\nremarks on their structure are vague) on the great quantity of the\r\ncalcareous matter, and on the casts containing animal matter, as shown\r\nby their evolving ammonia. Had Dr. Macaulay seen the enormous masses of\r\nrolled particles of shells and corals on the beach of Ascension, and\r\nespecially on coral-reefs; and had he reflected on the effects of\r\nlong-continued, gentle winds, in drifting up the finer particles, he\r\nwould hardly have advanced the argument of quantity, which is seldom\r\ntrustworthy in geology. If the calcareous matter has originated from\r\ndisintegrated shells and corals, the presence of animal matter is what\r\nmight have been expected. Mr. Anderson analysed for Dr. Macaulay part\r\nof a cast, and he found it composed of:—\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime......73.15 Silica.................11.90 Phosphate of\r\nlime.......8.81 Animal matter...........4.25 Sulphate of lime......a\r\ntrace 98.11)\r\n\r\nCalcareous deposits, like these of King George’s Sound, are of vast\r\nextent on the Australian shores. Dr. Fitton remarks, that “recent\r\ncalcareous breccia (by which term all these deposits are included) was\r\nfound during Baudin’s voyage, over a space of no less than twenty-five\r\ndegrees of latitude and an equal extent of longitude, on the southern,\r\nwestern, and north-western coasts.” (For ample details on this\r\nformation consult Dr. Fitton “Appendix to Captain King’s Voyage.” Dr.\r\nFitton is inclined to attribute a concretionary origin to the branching\r\nbodies: I may remark, that I have seen in beds of sand in La Plata\r\ncylindrical stems which no doubt thus originated; but they differed\r\nmuch in appearance from these at Bald Head, and the other places above\r\nspecified.) It appears also from M. Peron, with whose observations and\r\nopinions on the origin of the calcareous matter and branching casts\r\nmine entirely accord, that the deposit is generally much more\r\ncontinuous than near King George’s Sound. At Swan River, Archdeacon\r\nScott states that in one part it extends ten miles inland.\r\n(“Proceedings of the Geolog. Soc.” volume 1 page 320.) Captain Wickham,\r\nmoreover, informs me that during his late survey of the western coast,\r\nthe bottom of the sea, wherever the vessel anchored, was ascertained,\r\nby crowbars being let down, to consist of white calcareous matter.\r\nHence it seems that along this coast, as at Bermuda and at Keeling\r\nAtoll, submarine and subaerial deposits are contemporaneously in\r\nprocess of formation, from the disintegration of marine organic bodies.\r\nThe extent of these deposits, considering their origin, is very\r\nstriking; and they can be compared in this respect only with the great\r\ncoral-reefs of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In other parts of the\r\nworld, for instance in South America, there are SUPERFICIAL calcareous\r\ndeposits of great extent, in which not a trace of organic structure is\r\ndiscoverable; these observations would lead to the inquiry, whether\r\nsuch deposits may not, also, have been formed from disintegrated shells\r\nand corals.\r\n\r\nCAPE OF GOOD HOPE.\r\n\r\nAfter the accounts given by Barrow, Carmichael, Basil Hall, and W.B.\r\nClarke of the geology of this district, I shall confine myself to a few\r\nobservations on the junction of the three principal formations. The\r\nfundamental rock is granite (In several places I observed in the\r\ngranite, small dark-coloured balls, composed of minute scales of black\r\nmica in a tough basis. In another place, I found crystals of black\r\nschorl radiating from a common centre. Dr. Andrew Smith found, in the\r\ninterior parts of the country, some beautiful specimens of granite,\r\nwith silvery mica radiating or rather branching, like moss, from\r\ncentral points. At the Geological Society, there are specimens of\r\ngranite with crystallised feldspar branching and radiating in like\r\nmanner.), overlaid by clay-slate: the latter is generally hard, and\r\nglossy from containing minute scales of mica; it alternates with, and\r\npasses into, beds of slightly crystalline, feldspathic, slaty rock.\r\nThis clay-slate is remarkable from being in some places (as on the\r\nLion’s Rump) decomposed, even to the depth of twenty feet, into a\r\npale-coloured, sandstone-like rock, which has been mistaken, I believe,\r\nby some observers, for a separate formation. I was guided by Dr. Andrew\r\nSmith to a fine junction at Green Point between the granite and\r\nclay-slate: the latter at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the\r\nspot, where the granite appears on the beach (though, probably, the\r\ngranite is much nearer underground), becomes slightly more compact and\r\ncrystalline. At a less distance, some of the beds of clay-slate are of\r\na homogeneous texture, and obscurely striped with different zones of\r\ncolour, whilst others are obscurely spotted. Within a hundred yards of\r\nthe first vein of granite, the clay-slate consists of several\r\nvarieties; some compact with a tinge of purple, others glistening with\r\nnumerous minute scales of mica and imperfectly crystallised feldspar;\r\nsome obscurely granular, others porphyritic with small, elongated spots\r\nof a soft white mineral, which being easily corroded, gives to this\r\nvariety a vesicular appearance. Close to the granite, the clay-slate is\r\nchanged into a dark-coloured, laminated rock, having a granular\r\nfracture, which is due to imperfect crystals of feldspar, coated by\r\nminute, brilliant scales of mica.\r\n\r\nThe actual junction between the granitic and clay-slate districts\r\nextends over a width of about two hundred yards, and consists of\r\nirregular masses and of numerous dikes of granite, entangled and\r\nsurrounded by the clay- slate: most of the dikes range in a N.W. and\r\nS.E. line, parallel to the cleavage of the slate. As we leave the\r\njunction, thin beds, and lastly, mere films of the altered clay-slate\r\nare seen, quite isolated, as if floating, in the coarsely crystallised\r\ngranite; but although completely detached, they all retain traces of\r\nthe uniform N.W. and S.E. cleavage. This fact has been observed in\r\nother similar cases, and has been advanced by some eminent geologists\r\n(See M. Keilhau “Theory on Granite” translated in the “Edinburgh New\r\nPhilosophical Journal” volume 24 page 402.), as a great difficulty on\r\nthe ordinary theory, of granite having been injected whilst liquified;\r\nbut if we reflect on the probable state of the lower surface of a\r\nlaminated mass, like clay-slate, after having been violently arched by\r\na body of molten granite, we may conclude that it would be full of\r\nfissures parallel to the planes of cleavage; and that these would be\r\nfilled with granite, so that wherever the fissures were close to each\r\nother, mere parting layers or wedges of the slate would depend into the\r\ngranite. Should, therefore, the whole body of rock afterwards become\r\nworn down and denuded, the lower ends of these dependent masses or\r\nwedges of slate would be left quite isolated in the granite; yet they\r\nwould retain their proper lines of cleavage, from having been united,\r\nwhilst the granite was fluid, with a continuous covering of clay-slate.\r\n\r\nFollowing, in company with Dr. A. Smith, the line of junction between\r\nthe granite and the slate, as it stretched inland, in a S.E. direction,\r\nwe came to a place, where the slate was converted into a fine-grained,\r\nperfectly characterised gneiss, composed of yellow-brown granular\r\nfeldspar, of abundant black brilliant mica, and of few and thin laminae\r\nof quartz. From the abundance of the mica in this gneiss, compared with\r\nthe small quantity and excessively minute scales, in which it exists in\r\nthe glossy clay-slate, we must conclude, that it has been here formed\r\nby the metamorphic action—a circumstance doubted, under nearly similar\r\ncircumstances, by some authors. The laminae of the clay-slate are\r\nstraight; and it was interesting to observe, that as they assumed the\r\ncharacter of gneiss, they became undulatory with some of the smaller\r\nflexures angular, like the laminae of many true metamorphic schists.\r\n\r\nSANDSTONE FORMATION.\r\n\r\nThis formation makes the most imposing feature in the geology of\r\nSouthern Africa. The strata are in many parts horizontal, and attain a\r\nthickness of about two thousand feet. The sandstone varies in\r\ncharacter; it contains little earthy matter, but is often stained with\r\niron; some of the beds are very fine-grained and quite white; others\r\nare as compact and homogeneous as quartz rock. In some places I\r\nobserved a breccia of quartz, with the fragments almost dissolved in a\r\nsiliceous paste. Broad veins of quartz, often including large and\r\nperfect crystals, are very numerous; and it is evident in nearly all\r\nthe strata, that silica has been deposited from solution in remarkable\r\nquantity. Many of the varieties of quartzite appeared quite like\r\nmetamorphic rocks; but from the upper strata being as siliceous as the\r\nlower, and from the undisturbed junctions with the granite, which in\r\nmany places can be examined, I can hardly believe that these\r\nsandstone-strata have been exposed to heat. (The Rev. W.B. Clarke,\r\nhowever, states, to my surprise (“Geolog. Proceedings” volume 3 page\r\n422), that the sandstone in some parts is penetrated by granitic dikes:\r\nsuch dikes must belong to an epoch altogether subsequent to that when\r\nthe molten granite acted on the clay-slate.) On the lines of junction\r\nbetween these two great formations, I found in several places the\r\ngranite decayed to the depth of a few inches, and succeeded, either by\r\na thin layer of ferruginous shale, or by four or five inches in\r\nthickness of the re-cemented crystals of the granite, on which the\r\ngreat pile of sandstone immediately rested.\r\n\r\nMr. Schomburgk has described (“Geographical Journal” volume 10 page\r\n246.) a great sandstone formation in Northern Brazil, resting on\r\ngranite, and resembling to a remarkable degree, in composition and in\r\nthe external form of the land, this formation of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nThe sandstones of the great platforms of Eastern Australia, which also\r\nrest on granite, differ in containing more earthy and less siliceous\r\nmatter. No fossil remains have been discovered in these three vast\r\ndeposits. Finally, I may add that I did not see any boulders of\r\nfar-transported rocks at the Cape of Good Hope, or on the eastern and\r\nwestern shores of Australia, or at Van Diemen’s Land.
