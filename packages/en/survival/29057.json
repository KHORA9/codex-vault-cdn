Ag'l Society:\"_\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: Remote from the theatre of action in the late\r\nrebellion, Michigan has experienced comparatively few of the evils that\r\nfollowed immediately in its path. The usual pursuits of peaceful life,\r\nwere here scarcely disturbed, and by the permission of a Gracious\r\nProvidence, the industry of the inhabitants of our State was but little\r\ndiverted from its legitimate channels. Nevertheless, while so many of\r\nher patriot sons were engaged in the deadly strife of Southern\r\nbattle-fields, and the result of the struggle was in the uncertain\r\nfuture, a sombre cloud could not fail to brood over our daily life,\r\ninterfering with the full enjoyment of the blessings we retained.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the roar of cannon and the noise and tumult of war is no\r\nlonger heard in our land; the scenes of carnage and blood which our once\r\npeaceful and happy country has recently witnessed are at an end; the\r\nturmoil and strife of armed hosts in deadly conflict have ceased; the\r\npublic mind is no longer excited, and the hearts of the people are no\r\nlonger pained, by the fearful news of battles fought, and of the\r\nterrible slaughter of kindred and friends. Social order again invites us\r\nto renewed efforts in our respective labor and callings; and we are\r\npermitted \"to beat our swords into plow-shares and our spears into\r\npruning-hooks.\"\r\n\r\nLike the calm and quiet repose of peace when it follows the clamor and\r\ndin of war, so is the delightful, cheering and invigorating approach of\r\nspring, as it succeeds the chilling blasts and pelting storms of dreary\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this is verified to us on the present occasion. We have\r\ncome together at this delightful spot, and on this beautiful spring day,\r\nnot only for the enjoyment of a festive season, but also for the\r\nimprovement of our minds and the increase of our present stock of\r\nknowledge on subjects with which our several interests and our\r\nrespective tastes are more or less identified.\r\n\r\nAt your request and upon your kind invitation, I am here to contribute\r\nmy share--small though it be--to the general fund. I should, however,\r\nhave much preferred the position of a quiet learner to that of an\r\nincompetent teacher--to have _listened_ rather than to have _spoken_.\r\nBut being here, it will be my purpose--by your indulgence--to speak, in\r\ngeneral terms, upon such topics as seem to me appropriate to the\r\noccasion. I shall not presume to theorize, or to speculate; neither\r\nshall I travel through unexplored fields with no other guide than\r\nimagination; nor shall I attempt to entertain you with any rhetorical\r\nflourishes, or figures of speech; but in a simple manner endeavor to\r\ngive briefly my own views on the several subjects discussed.\r\n\r\nThe occasion is undoubtedly one affording a wide field for profitable\r\ndiscussion; yet the space which your greatest indulgence can be expected\r\nto allow me will render it necessary that I confine myself to a very few\r\ntopics, and will barely permit a hasty glance at some of those only\r\nwhich may be considered appropriate in this address. You will therefore,\r\nI trust, remember that in case I do not refer to subjects which you may\r\ndeem of importance, it will be from this reason, and not because I may\r\nhave considered them unimportant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, permit me a brief reference to this\r\nAssociation, under whose auspices, and by whose directions--acting in\r\nconnection with the officers of the Agricultural College--this festival\r\nis held. Your Society, I understand, extends over the counties of\r\nIngham, Eaton, Clinton, Livingston and Shiawassee, and has been formed\r\nfor the purpose of combining and concentrating a wider scope of\r\nindividual action than could otherwise be attained, with a view to an\r\nincreased interest in the subject of Agriculture and of Agricultural\r\nFairs; thereby recognizing the principle that \"in union there is\r\nstrength.\"\r\n\r\nThe effort is not only laudable, but will, I have no doubt, be\r\nproductive of the most beneficial results. In fact we have in this very\r\neffort to bring into notice and give an increased interest to one of our\r\nmost important branches of husbandry in our State--the growth and\r\nproduction of wool--abundant evidence that such will be the result. By\r\ncoming together, as on the present occasion, in the spirit of a free,\r\nfrank and social interchange of ideas, an increased interest cannot fail\r\nof being awakened, as well as an extensive inquiry instituted, among\r\nfarmers generally, not only as to the most desirable breed of sheep, but\r\nalso as to the best modes of tending and keeping and feeding the\r\ndifferent kinds, with a view to the greatest profits. The influence of\r\nsuch a gathering as this is of much value--not only in encouraging a\r\ndesire for excellence and creating a spirit of competition and of\r\nlaudable emulation, but as furnishing the means for an active exchange\r\nof the more desirable specimens. Those who assemble are enabled to enjoy\r\na season not merely of relaxation from toil, but also for mutual\r\nconsultation and discussion; and a healthy and growing interest in\r\neverything pertaining to Agriculture, in all its varied forms and\r\nbranches, is thereby induced.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I may be permitted to make a few remarks in relation\r\nto the salutary influence which our Agricultural Societies cannot fail\r\nto exert upon the farmers of Michigan, and of the _benefits_ which are\r\ncertain to flow from them.\r\n\r\nThere is no employment which keeps man so isolated as that of\r\nAgriculture; and these societies serve, in a very great degree, to\r\ncounteract the bad effects of this by bringing mind into intercourse\r\nwith mind. They should receive the united and cordial support of every\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nWhilst professional men are brought into frequent contact with each\r\nother--and the trader is in constant intercourse with his customers--and\r\nthe mechanic is associated with those employed with him in the\r\nshops--the farmer spends most of his time with his family, and with his\r\nflocks and herds, and sees comparatively little of others. The\r\nAgricultural Fair brings--or should bring--all the farmers together,\r\nwith their wives and daughters, where a healthy, social intercourse is\r\nenjoyed. There a higher standard of excellence in everything is formed.\r\nHe there learns that what of his own he had been led to believe was the\r\nbest--whether in flocks or herds, or farm products--may be greatly\r\nimproved, and his ambition and pride, as well as his interest, are at\r\nonce excited to make an advance. At the same time the industrious\r\nhousewife, and the blushing Miss, by an examination of the cloths and\r\nflannels--the carpets and quilts--the embroidered skirts and capes--the\r\ncollars and slippers, discover that these articles are worthy not only\r\nof their admiration but of their emulation, and they, too, resolve to\r\ncopy from a standard of merit higher than their own. Thus is excited\r\namong those so brought together a spirit of competition, and a desire in\r\ntheir turn to excel.\r\n\r\nAnother important benefit resulting from Agricultural Fairs, is a more\r\nrapid and general diffusion of knowledge among the farmers in regard to\r\nthe advantages and practical utility of new inventions, for the saving\r\nof time and labor in agricultural operations. This is illustrated very\r\nclearly by the exhibition of Mr. Parish's \"Stump and Grub Extractor,\" on\r\nexhibition here. This machine, I understand, was patented on the first\r\nday of the present month, and _now_ all in attendance at this Fair have\r\nhad an opportunity of witnessing its operations and judging for\r\nthemselves of its merits. An effective machine of this kind is of\r\nincalculable value to the farmer in removing _at once_ from his fields\r\nthe unsightly stumps that disfigure them, and which adds so much to the\r\nlabor of cultivating those fields. Of the machine itself, I may be\r\npermitted to say, by way of digression, that it surpasses in the\r\neffectiveness of its operations anything of the kind which I have yet\r\nhad an opportunity of witness.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The mutual consultation and discussion consequent\r\nupon Agricultural Fairs, begets a spirit of inquiry and a desire for\r\ninformation in relation to every subject connected with the farmer's\r\ncalling, and to gratify which he has recourse to periodicals and other\r\nworks in which its various branches are discussed and explained. He will\r\nthere learn what agricultural chemistry has done for him, and the\r\nimportance and value of the analysis of the different kinds of soil. He\r\nwill also find the result of the various systems of husbandry practiced\r\nby others as well as the effects of experiments made, and thereby\r\nsecure to himself their benefits without incurring their cost. And\r\nalthough no amount of reading alone can make a man a farmer, yet the\r\nknowledge derived from a perusal of agricultural papers devoted to the\r\ninterests of the tillers of the soil will be of incalculable value to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP-HUSBANDRY.\r\n\r\nIt will undoubtedly be expected that \"Sheep-Husbandry,\" not only from\r\nthe importance of the subject itself, but because of its being the\r\nprincipal feature in this exhibition, should receive at my hands a due\r\nshare of consideration.\r\n\r\nI am free to confess, however, that the subject will be approached with\r\nno small degree of hesitancy and distrust on my part, not only because\r\nof my want of practical knowledge in regard to it, but also because it\r\nmay be fairly regarded, I think, in many respects at least, as a sort of\r\ndebatable ground.\r\n\r\nDifferent views are undoubtedly entertained by equally intelligent and\r\nexperienced men, upon this as well as upon other equally important\r\nsubjects; and the fact I believe is well established that \"Doctors\" not\r\nonly _may_ but _do_ very often \"disagree,\" and that, too, sometimes very\r\ntenaciously. Should I advance opinions at variance with those\r\nentertained by well-informed and practical men who may listen to me, I\r\nwill simply remark that I am not here to lay down rules and establish\r\nprinciples for the guidance of any one, but to discuss principles and\r\nrules of action, as well as practical questions, with a view to lead\r\nothers the more carefully to inquire into and investigate the same.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Sheep-Husbandry with us is certainly an important\r\none--wool being a great, leading staple product of our State; and very\r\nmuch attention is now being paid to it, which is fully justified by the\r\nadvantages of our soil and climate for the keeping of sheep. The farmers\r\nof Michigan are fully aroused to the importance of this interest, and\r\nhave labored zealously, and at much expense and cost, to improve their\r\nbreeds of sheep, and to foster and develop this great interest. They\r\nhave certainly done much in this direction; but more--very much more, I\r\napprehend--remains yet to be done.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered that a blind zeal, without that\r\nknowledge which is the result of experience, observation and study, will\r\ndo very little in the right direction.\r\n\r\nSheep, like cattle, should be selected for specific purposes, and in\r\nreference to affording the greatest profit under existing, and probable\r\nfuture circumstances. The exclusive cultivation of this or that\r\nbreed--of the fine or coarse, or of the long or short wools--whether\r\nkept exclusively for their wool, or both for their wool and the\r\nshambles, should never be practiced, unless under special and unusual\r\ncircumstances. The farmer in this, as in every other agricultural\r\ndepartment, must endeavor to see his relation to the merchant, and adopt\r\na practice having in view the chances of ultimately reaching the most\r\ncertain as well as the most profitable market; for, after all, the\r\nconnection between the producer and the manufacturer and merchant, is\r\nbut a partnership for loss and gain. The merchant will call upon the\r\nmanufacturer for such woolen goods as his market demands, irrespective\r\nof the mere opinion which any one may entertain in favor of this or that\r\nkind of wool; and the manufacturer, in his turn, will call upon the\r\nfarmer for just what is wanted. The farmer should therefore, in the\r\nselection of his flocks, have in view the market upon which he is to\r\nrely for the sale of his wool; the texture and weight of fleece; the\r\nhealth and vigor of body and constitution, as well as the habits and\r\neconomy of the animal. He should sedulously seek to bring his sheep to a\r\nhigh degree of perfection in every respect. In seeking to obtain quality\r\nof fleece it is a self-evident fact that he should not overlook\r\nquantity; and that quantity should also be considered in connection with\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nIt is a patent fact, of which if we needed evidence it may be found in\r\nthis exhibition as well as in the numerous county exhibitions of similar\r\ncharacter, which have recently been held, where very rarely any other\r\nclass of sheep are seen, that a strong preference for fine-wooled\r\nMerinos is very generally, if not almost exclusively, entertained at the\r\npresent time among the farmers of this State, and money in the purchase\r\nof that class is of but little account. It is well known that very high\r\nprices are being paid not only for single specimens but for whole flocks\r\nof this breed. This is probably all right, so far as it is necessary for\r\nthe purpose of attaining excellence in flocks, upon points already\r\nspoken of. To such a preference there should be no objection, if it be\r\nnot carried so far as to superinduce an unprofitable reaction--and\r\nprovided that the demand for the grade of wool produced by these sheep\r\nis to have no limit, and that all which can be grown is sure always to\r\ncommand a remunerative price. But will this probably be so? Let us\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nAs I have already intimated, the demand for any particular quality or\r\nkind of wool will not depend upon the fact that farmer A or farmer B has\r\nsuch wool to sell, taken from sheep for which he paid very large prices,\r\nand of which he has now a very large flock; but rather because that\r\nparticular kind and quality of wool is called for by the manufacturer\r\nsimply to fill the orders of the merchant, who in his turn is only\r\ndesirous to supply the demands of the consumer.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of our imports, it appears that in 1863, of _sixty\r\nmillions_ of woolen goods, about _forty millions_ were manufactured of\r\nthe longer worsted wool. This wool is required to make a fabric of\r\nlustrous appearance for imitations of Alapaca, and for a supply of which\r\nour manufacturers now depend mostly on foreign countries The price of\r\ncombing wool has been for some time increasing rapidly, in comparison\r\nwith other wool, in consequence of its consumption gaining upon its\r\ngrowth. And I saw recently that the British farmer had been urged to\r\nincrease the production of this article to its fullest extent, both from\r\na consideration of duty as well as of interest.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer of Alapaca cloths--a most beautiful fabric of recent\r\nintroduction--and their extensive use, has not only led to this\r\nincreased demand, but has enhanced the price of this kind of wool, which\r\nwill undoubtedly be maintained, as new fabrics requiring to be made from\r\nlong wools, especially for the garments of ladies, are now being\r\nintroduced in great variety, and are becoming daily more popular and of\r\nmore general use. Another cause for the continued and increasing demand\r\nfor these wools is the facility with which they can be used for the\r\npurpose of making imitations of Lama fabrics and Alapacas; and I have no\r\ndoubt that factories for the manufacture of these goods will rapidly\r\nmultiply in New England and elsewhere, and will soon, to a very great\r\nextent take the place of those now consuming the fine wools.\r\n\r\nIn support of these views, permit me to give the following extracts from\r\nthe work of Mr. Randall, the well known and enthusiastic champion of the\r\nMerinos. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"In the American market there is a much larger demand for medium\r\n     than fine wools, and the former commands much the best price in\r\n     proportion to its cost of production.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he says:\r\n\r\n     \"American producers of very fine wool have ever fed an expectation,\r\n     but never obtained the fruition of their hopes.\"\r\n\r\nThese are significant admissions, coming as they do from such a quarter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe South Downs are a variety of sheep of decided merit; but have never,\r\nI think, been fully appreciated by the farmers of Michigan. They are of\r\nlarge size and symmetrically formed, with hardy and robust\r\nconstitutions, and their wool is fine, short and curled, and destitute\r\nof fibrous spires that give to it the felting properties. It is neither\r\na short nor a long staple, but ranks in this country as \"middle wool.\"\r\nThe shorter staples are made into flannels and light woolen goods; and\r\nthe longer are extensively used for combing. Their mutton is\r\nunsurpassed; its flavor is delicate, and the flesh juicy and well\r\nintermixed with fat. They are the most prolific breeders--the proportion\r\nof ewes bringing twins being at least fifty per cent. I recently saw a\r\nfine flock of South Down ewes in the State of New York of which more\r\nthan three-fourths of the whole flock had twins.\r\n\r\nAmong the more desirable varieties or families, for the production of\r\nlong wool, in this climate, are, perhaps, the Cotswolds, noble specimens\r\nof which you have had an opportunity of inspecting on this occasion;\r\nand have, I trust, with me, been highly gratified at their weight of\r\ncarcass, combined with their fine forms and apparent hardiness of\r\nconstitution, as well as the superior fleeces they have now yielded.\r\n\r\nMy purpose, however, is not to advocate the claims of this or that class\r\nof sheep at the expense of any other, but to present such views for your\r\nconsideration as may lead to a more thorough and candid investigation of\r\nthe whole matter.\r\n\r\nLet me say in continuation of this subject, that in a comparison between\r\nthe Cotswold and other long wool varieties, with the fine wool Merinos\r\nthe _advantage as to weight of fleece_ is decidedly with the former; and\r\nespecially so when their respective fleeces are thoroughly cleansed and\r\nscoured; for whilst the loss of the long wools very rarely reaches\r\n_twenty per cent._, that of the Merinos generally much exceed _fifty per\r\ncent._, and the fleeces of prize rams often more than _seventy per\r\ncent._ Manufacturers are already beginning to make a discrimination\r\nbetween wool that is clean and that which is not so. Suppose they buy\r\nthe South Down, Cotswold and Leicester wools, and their grades, from\r\nwhich is lost by scouring twenty per cent. only, whilst upon the finest\r\nMichigan wool there is lost _fifty_ per cent. and more--making the cost\r\nof the latter, at ordinary prices, one-third more per pound than the\r\nformer, how long will it be before they will study to increase their\r\nconsumption of long wool when they can make from _thirty_ to _forty_ per\r\ncent. more cloth with the same money? They will certainly seek to avoid,\r\nin some way, the necessity of buying with their wool so very large a per\r\ncentage of grease and dirt, as they claim they are now doing in the\r\npurchase of fine wools.\r\n\r\nThe South Downs, as I have already stated, as well as the long wool\r\nsheep, have a decided advantage in the quantity and value of meat which\r\nthey yield for the shambles; for no one, I apprehend, will deny the fact\r\nthey not only yield more wool but very much more flesh to the live\r\nweight than do the Merinos. And this is a fact worthy the serious\r\nconsideration of farmers, and certainly a strong argument in favor of\r\nthe more general breeding of long wool sheep. The war, and perhaps other\r\ncauses, have very seriously reduced our supply of meats, the waste of\r\nwhich cannot soon be repaired. Many of our soldiers will not again\r\nreturn to rural life, which will be quite too tame for them after the\r\nlong, protracted excitement of war. They will seek other occupations,\r\nand be consumers rather than producers of meats. In addition to this a\r\ntide of foreign immigration is setting in upon our shores, where they\r\nwill continue to swarm for years to come as never before, hungry for\r\nmeat; and it has been conclusively demonstrated that the ratio of our\r\nordinary increase of population far exceeds the production of cattle and\r\nsheep, which deficiency in beef and mutton must hereafter be supplied in\r\nsome way. I will again quote from Mr. Randall's work. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"I am strongly impressed with the opinion that the production of\r\n     mutton has been too much disregarded as a concomitant of the\r\n     production of wool. Near large meat markets mutton is the _prime\r\n     consideration_, and wool but the accessory.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a potent combination of circumstances, which were never\r\nbefore brought together, guaranteeing an abundant remuneration, as I\r\nbelieve, to those who may engage in this particular branch of husbandry;\r\nand the field, although now new, will nevertheless, I have little doubt,\r\nbe very soon successfully occupied. I cannot but hope that our ambitious\r\nand enterprising stock breeders will secure to themselves their full\r\nshare.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have already exhausted your patience by dwelling so long upon\r\nthis subject; but regarding it--as I most certainly do--as a very\r\nimportant one, and this being an appropriate occasion for its\r\ndiscussion, you will, I trust, bear with me a moment longer, whilst I\r\nventure to make a few practical suggestions, before taking leave of it.\r\nLet me then say, in this matter of Sheep Husbandry, in addition to what\r\nhas already been said, that you should guard against extreme views of\r\nany kind. Merinos are undoubtedly a valuable and a very desirable breed\r\nof sheep, as witness the noble specimens exhibited on this occasion; but\r\nyou do not want them and nothing else, unless they will pay a better\r\nprofit than any other sheep; nor should you pay an extravagantly high\r\nprice for them merely to enrich the sheep-breeders of another State; nor\r\nbecause it is fashionable to do so. You should remember that the South\r\nDowns, the Leicesters, the Cotswolds, as well as some others perhaps,\r\nalso have their respective claims to favor and are worthy of your\r\nconsideration. My own opinion is that a grade of sheep may be produced\r\nby a cross between the Cotswolds and some other varieties, which will\r\nfurnish a staple of fine, long, combing wool of lustrous appearance,\r\nthat will prove--all things considered--quite as remunerative as fleeces\r\nfrom the choicest Merinos and their grades.\r\n\r\nYou should, also, avoid the too common error of overstocking with sheep\r\nwhen the price of wool is high. Sheep Husbandry has been a very\r\nprofitable branch of business for the farmers of this State; but like\r\nevery other business it may be overdone, and is liable to fluctuations\r\nand changes. Sheep must be well fed and cared for in order to produce\r\nheavy fleeces; and there is certainly a limit to the number which may\r\nprofitably be kept upon any farm; and it not unfrequently happens that a\r\nflock of fifty sheep on a small farm, will yield a larger net profit\r\nthan would a flock of five hundred if kept upon the same farm.\r\n\r\nWhen the price of wool is high, the farmers are too reluctant to sell\r\noff their sheep, and thus become liable to an overstock. In fact, this\r\nis now the great danger of the wool-growers of Michigan. The best\r\neconomy, and the most judicious management, will be to keep down the\r\nnumber of your flocks to your means of pasturage and feed; and\r\nconstantly aim to improve the grade and quality of those you retain by\r\ndisposing of the less desirable specimens for mutton. Your motto should\r\nbe to elevate the standard of your flocks, rather than to increase their\r\nnumber beyond your means of feeding.\r\n\r\nAnother evil is also to be guarded against,--that of giving your\r\nattention to sheep to the exclusion of cattle. I am aware that in the\r\npast there have been--in this State--few advocates for the raising of\r\ncattle, and that the sound judgment of any man would at once be brought\r\ninto question who should attempt to do so. But I think there has been\r\nmore of prejudice than reason in this. The farmer, as a mere matter of\r\npolicy, should not confine himself to any one thing, as thereby the\r\nfluctuations and changes incident to any branch of business, may very\r\npossibly--nay very probably--disappoint his hopes and expectations. If\r\nhe has only sheep on which to rely, a sudden fall in the price of sheep\r\nand wool, or a general prevalence of any of the diseases to which sheep\r\nare always liable, would be a serious disaster to him; whereas, if his\r\nattention is directed to both sheep and cattle, as well as to horses,\r\nswine, &c., his chances of certain and continued success are very\r\ngreatly multiplied. In fact, cattle are already commanding enormous\r\nprices in consequence of a general scarcity everywhere, not only for the\r\nshambles, but for the dairy, and this deficiency will not, I apprehend,\r\nbe very soon supplied. I have recently visited some of the more highly\r\ncultivated portions of the State of New York, where I found good fair\r\ncows were worth _one hundred dollars_ each and not easily to be had at\r\nthat. Good sized, first quality working oxen, are now worth here $250\r\nper pair; and a large lot of cattle has recently been sold for beef in\r\nFlint, at seven cents per pound, live weight. Horses, too, are scarce,\r\nand must continue to be so for a long time, as their destruction by the\r\nlate war was very great, and years will be required to replace those so\r\ndestroyed, especially in the rebel and border States, which must be\r\nsupplied from the North. Swine, also, are now deficient, and principally\r\nbecause, a few years since, for a time the price of pork was very low,\r\nand their growth was in consequence, at once almost abandoned. The\r\nfarmer should take a broader view of things, and pursue a steady, onward\r\ncourse, avoiding all extremes, as well as sudden changes. As a large\r\nportion of his farm products are more adapted to the feed of cattle,\r\nhorses and swine than to sheep, he should, if for no other reason, keep\r\na due proportion of these animals, any excitement in favor of sheep\r\nnotwithstanding. My own opinion most decidedly is, that the time has\r\ncome when the best interests of the farmers of Michigan require that a\r\nportion of the attention now being devoted to sheep husbandry should be\r\ndirected to that of other kinds of stock.\r\n\r\nBut, to return again from this digression to the subject of sheep and\r\nwool.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious difficulties with which the farmers have to\r\ncontend, is the combinations that are too often sought to be made by\r\npurchasers to secure their wool at the lowest possible figures. The\r\nmanufacturers and wool buyers, undoubtedly act in concert,--at least to\r\nsome considerable extent,--to depress the price, and especially so,\r\nbefore and about the time the new clip is coming in. They are well\r\ndrilled in this, and many of their operations are systematic and\r\nefficient. At such time they pretend not to be in want of wool,--that\r\nthe demand will be light, &c. Purchases are made very sparingly, and\r\ntemporary supplies are procured from other sources, even at a higher\r\ncost than the farmers ask. This is done upon the ground that an\r\noccasional sacrifice of this kind pays well in the end, if thereby they\r\nare able to keep down the price of the great bulk of domestic wool.\r\nSometimes fictitious sales are reported, and various other means are\r\nemployed to this end, with the view that a few holders, at\r\nleast,--either from necessity or timidity,--may be induced to sell, and\r\nthus aid their efforts to establish low prices.\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes the duty of the farmers to act with much consideration,\r\nstudy and wisdom; and purely as a matter of self-defense, to adopt some\r\nconcert of action among themselves for the protection of their own\r\ninterests. When the price is low and the market dull at the time of\r\nshearing, there should not be too much haste in making sales. In 1861, I\r\nthink it was, the farmers were over anxious to sell, for no other reason\r\nthan because at that time the price of wool was very low and the market\r\ndull. They then overlooked the well established commercial fact that\r\ndepressed markets generally advance, rather than retrograde, and that\r\nGovernment disbursements then certain to be made would create funds and\r\na higher market, and that the demand for the staple would increase. They\r\nconsequently sold for _twenty-five cents_ per pound, fleeces, that in\r\nless than three months commanded _forty-five_ to _fifty_ cents. They\r\nalso, in many instances, offered to sell their fleeces for less than\r\nhalf the sum they would bring in a very few weeks. On the other hand, as\r\nis too common, when wool at the time of shearing commands a high price\r\nand the market is brisk, the farmers are inclined to hold on for still\r\nhigher prices. But this is another mistake in the opposite direction.\r\nThe rule should be,--\"_sell_\" when the market is quick, and prices are\r\ngood;--and \"_hold on_\" when the market is dull and prices are low.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, permit me to call your attention to another\r\nimportant matter in connection with sheep husbandry in this State.\r\nSufficient care has not heretofore been taken to clean and otherwise\r\nproperly prepare this great and important staple for market, and the\r\nconsequence has been that the character and representation of \"Michigan\r\nwool,\" I am sorry to discover, has been very seriously lowered in the\r\nmarket, and a great loss to the producers has thereby been sustained. It\r\nis a fact, perhaps not generally known, that from this cause alone,\r\n\"Ohio wool\" sells for about _five_ to _ten cents_ per pound more than\r\n\"Michigan wool.\" In an interview which I recently had with an extensive\r\neastern manufacturer, who was induced last season for the first time to\r\npurchase a lot of \"Michigan wool,\" he expressed his surprise that the\r\nMichigan wool growers should be so heedless of their own interests as to\r\noverlook this important fact. From his statements I learned that the\r\nprejudice of the manufacturers against \"Michigan wool\" was so great that\r\nmany of them would not buy it at hardly any price when they could get\r\n\"Ohio wool.\" He said a large proportion of our wool was poorly washed,\r\nand that this was true of a great proportion of our finest and best\r\nlots; and that it was not only sent to market in this condition, but was\r\nbadly and slovenly put up, with much larger twine than they use in\r\nOhio,--the fleeces, also having a torn and jagged appearance; and many\r\nof them, when opened, were found to contain the _unwashed_ tags. He,\r\nhowever, expressed himself highly pleased with the quality of the wool\r\nhe had purchased, and said it compared favorably in that respect with\r\nany he had ever received from Ohio; and he believed if our wool could be\r\nsent to market as clean and in as good condition otherwise as the Ohio\r\nwool,--and the prejudice which has been created against it, in\r\nconsequence of this not having been the case heretofore, could once be\r\nremoved, he doubted not that \"Michigan wool\" would command in the market\r\nthe highest prices and the most ready sales.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a serious matter, and prompt and efficient measures,\r\nof some kind, should at once be taken to remedy the evil; and every\r\nwool-grower should feel, as he really is, personally interested in the\r\nwork. I commend this subject, gentlemen, to your serious consideration,\r\nand trust some concert of action will be had to prevent a continuance of\r\nthis great evil, and to place \"Michigan wool\" where it should most\r\ncertainly stand, at the head of the list. If this can be done in no\r\nother way, I would suggest the formation of a \"Wool-Growers Board of\r\nTrade,\" or some other efficient organization for the purpose--if for no\r\nother--of tracing out and holding up to scorn every individual who shall\r\naid in inflicting so serious an injury to this great interest, and of\r\ndoing so great a wrong to his neighbors and fellow-citizens, and that,\r\ntoo, from the base and fraudulent motive of selling dirt and tags as\r\nfine wool--for be assured that any imposition of this sort, practiced\r\nupon manufacturers, will recoil upon our own heads; and where _one_ cent\r\nwill thus be saved, thousands, yes, tens of thousands of dollars, will,\r\nas a necessary consequence, be indirectly lost to the farmers of\r\nMichigan. And the loss they have sustained from this cause during the\r\nlast three or four years will undoubtedly exceed the enormous sum of two\r\nmillions of dollars.\r\n\r\nBut I must take leave of this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nPermit me now to occupy your attention for a brief space whilst I speak\r\nof this Institution--the State Agricultural College--upon whose grounds\r\nwe are now assembled, and where by the kindness and courtesy of its\r\nofficers, we have been so cordially welcomed and so pleasantly\r\nentertained. It is not, I think, inappropriate to the occasion that I\r\nshould do so.\r\n\r\nLet me remind you then, in the outset of my remarks on this subject,\r\nthat this Institution is in its early infancy; and that notwithstanding\r\nthe beautiful landscape which is spread out before us; with its verdant\r\nfields just springing into luxuriance, dotted with the finest specimens\r\nof the choicest breeds of sheep and cattle, with the College grounds\r\nskillfully laid out and now in process of being tastefully adorned by\r\nArt, a few years only have been numbered with the past since not only\r\nthis spot, but all the surrounding country, as well as almost the entire\r\nterritory of our young, but noble and now highly prosperous State, was\r\nan unbroken wilderness, covered with the primeval forest, the entangled\r\nwoods giving shelter and concealment to wild and ferocious beasts, as\r\nwell as to the wandering and savage red man. What a change has thus been\r\nwrought in a few short years! the result of the toil and privation of\r\nthe adventurous pioneers, of whom many have already become intelligent,\r\nenterprising and forehanded farmers.\r\n\r\nAnd more than this: Michigan, although but recently settled, and one of\r\nthe youngest in the great sisterhood of States, has been the first to\r\nestablish a professional school for the agricultural education of her\r\nsons, in which is not only taught the sciences and their application to\r\nagriculture, but also agriculture as an art, with such experiments as\r\nare calculated to impart a more thorough and practical knowledge of the\r\nsame; and connected with the study of these a department of manual\r\nlabor; the legitimate effect of all which is to increase the student's\r\ndesire for knowledge as well as his love of study, and to remove the\r\nbarrier too often existing between the educated and laboring\r\nclasses--which can only be done by giving a better education to those\r\nwho labor, and by removing the prejudices of the educated against labor.\r\n\r\nBut I propose to speak more definitely of the aims and objects of this\r\nInstitution, as well as its claims to the favor and support of the\r\nfarmers of Michigan. They need not be told, I think, that its design is\r\nto promote their benefit. But have the farmers of this State, as a\r\nclass, heretofore recognized this fact? And have they in return for the\r\nadvantages which it proposes to them, given it that countenance and\r\nencouragement which it claims at their hands? I fear not. There are, it\r\nis true, noble exceptions to this; yet it is also true that a large\r\nproportion of their number have looked upon it with suspicion and\r\ndistrust, as though its purpose was to do them a wrong--to inflict upon\r\nthem an evil. They have not merely withheld from it their aid and\r\nsupport, but their active influence has too often been exerted to its\r\ndisadvantage and prejudice. This is certainly wrong--very wrong!\r\n\r\nLet us look a little into this matter. Is knowledge--a knowledge of\r\nthose sciences which are intimately connected with agriculture as an\r\nart--of no value to the farmer? Is it necessary that he should be a dolt\r\nin order to be fitted for his vocation? Will ignorance and bad husbandry\r\nincrease his crops or enable him to find a better market for his\r\nproducts? Or, will his enjoyment, in his daily round of toil, be any\r\ngreater because unconscious that he is groping his way along in the\r\ndark? No! For however that may have been in the past it is certainly not\r\nthe case now. And although \"ignorance,\" as it is said, may be \"bliss,\"\r\nyet in these days, at least, it must be a sort of negative bliss.\r\n\r\nIgnorance is certainly not power; nor does it lead to wealth as a means\r\nof comfortable support and enjoyment--which is the legitimate end of all\r\nlabor. Will _ignorance_ give respectability, or sweeten the toil of the\r\nhusbandman? Will it elevate his thoughts and desires to higher and\r\nnobler aims, or inspire him to \"look from nature up to nature's God?\"\r\nWill it lead him instead of a fixed stolid gaze upon the earth over\r\nwhich he walks, to engage in the study of those great and omnipotent\r\nlaws which regulate all matter, and which so wonderfully, yet certainly\r\ncontrol both the animal and vegetable kingdoms? No! It will accomplish\r\nnone of these desirable ends, but the very reverse of them all.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is so self-evident to intelligent men, that to advance\r\nit to such an audience as the one before me--except as the basis of an\r\nargument--must be entirely superfluous. But what was the social position\r\nof the farmers, let me ask--even in this highly favored country--fifty\r\nor sixty years ago? Were they not then regarded as men without\r\nknowledge--devoid almost of sensibilities--unfitted for anything except\r\nthe mere routine of daily labor and toil--and capable only of delving in\r\nthe soil day by day? And were they not then considered, even by\r\nthemselves as well as by others, as occupying the very lowest position\r\nin the scale of society? Such were the facts. Every person who was\r\nregarded as too ignorant and uncultivated for other pursuits, was, by\r\ncommon consent, considered as having a prescriptive right to farming as\r\na vocation. In fact ignorance was regarded as the proper and sufficient\r\ndiploma for the farmer. And as a consequence he was not only poor and\r\nwithout influence, but too often considered by others as without\r\nrespectability merely because he was a farmer; and all that was conceded\r\nto him--in fact all that he claimed for himself--was a simple\r\nsubsistence upon the hardest fare, without any of the luxuries, and very\r\noften with a scarcity of the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nRemember, I am speaking of the farmers, as a class, _fifty_ or _sixty_\r\nyears ago--before there were any county fairs, or agricultural colleges,\r\nnewspapers or magazines, and when agriculture was the result of labor\r\nwithout knowledge, system or calculation.\r\n\r\nBut although the farmers have emerged from this condition very slowly,\r\nyet what is their position now? Are they not regarded as being on a\r\nlevel at least with those of other callings in social importance? Do\r\nthey not occupy positions of confidence and trust in society? Are they\r\nnot found in our Legislative Halls in fair proportion with men of\r\ndifferent pursuits? This is certainly true: and the advance alone is the\r\nresult of a higher mental culture--of a wider range of thought--and of\r\nan increased fund of knowledge, and consequently of an improved system\r\nof farming.\r\n\r\nAnd if the advance of agriculture and the condition of the farmer have\r\nbeen tardy, as compared with the improvement in other departments of\r\nlabor--in other avocations of life--it is solely because science and\r\nstudy have not as soon been applied to agriculture--and because also the\r\nfarmer has not been permitted the advantages resulting from so early a\r\ndevelopment of facts connected with his calling as have other classes of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nBut the great work is now fairly in progress of elevating the farmer to\r\nhis true position in the social order of society--of teaching him that\r\nhis vocation, instead of being the dull, unintellectual lot of the\r\nignorant, is the most noble and dignified, as well as the most conducive\r\nto men's happiness in which he can be engaged; and nothing is now\r\nwanting to secure the steady advancement of this work, but for the\r\nfarmers to do justice to themselves and to their calling, by laying hold\r\nof the means for that end which are placed within their reach. Assuming\r\nall this to be undeniably true, where can be found more potent agencies\r\nin the work of elevation than Agricultural Colleges? And why, then,\r\nshould any farmer in this State hold back from giving this Institution\r\nhis cordial and hearty support? And stranger still--why should he put\r\nhimself in antagonism to its success? Such an attitude, to my mind, is\r\nnot merely unwise, but preposterous--yes, suicidal. If the College is\r\nnot what it should be, the more his self-interest should prompt him to\r\nbestow upon it his aid. It is the _Farmers' Institution_--founded for\r\n_his_ benefit, at much cost; and if _he_ does not feel an interest in it\r\nand labor to make it a success, who will? Who should?\r\n\r\nBut why have a portion of the farmers of Michigan seemed to look with\r\ndistrust upon this Institution, and in some cases, I regret to say,\r\nseemed to regard it as a sort of wrong to themselves; and if they have\r\nnot actually opposed, have, at least, withheld from it their support? I\r\nmust confess, that should I give what seemed to me to be the true answer\r\nto these questions, it might be regarded by some who have not very\r\ncarefully looked into the subject, as an assumption on my part\r\nunwarranted by facts.\r\n\r\nWould that it were so; that I were mistaken. But having given the\r\nsubject some little thought and investigation, you will, I trust, permit\r\nme the honest expression of my own views upon this important matter. It\r\nis for that purpose and none other, that I am here. But you, Mr.\r\nPresident, as well as all those now present, can certainly take no\r\npersonal exception to these views, as the very fact of such presence\r\nshows that you are not of the class to which I may allude; and I am\r\ngratified in being able to say that I believe there are very many\r\nothers, not present, who are the warm and devoted friends of this\r\nInstitution; and who, with you, I most certainly hope, constitute the\r\nrule and not the exception.\r\n\r\nBut the answer: And in giving which, I will avail myself of the\r\nprivilege conceded to a certain class of men,--that of answering one\r\nquestion by asking another. Why then do men ever oppose or neglect their\r\nown interests? To my mind, only from want of knowledge, from prejudice\r\nor self-will--or some other of the same brood of enemies to man's\r\nsuccess in laudable undertakings; and of which _ignorance_ is the chief,\r\nand may be regarded as the prolific source of all the others. In this\r\ncase, undoubtedly, as in others, some are opposed from a mere notion of\r\nopposition, or from a mere whim; others again, simply to agree with, or\r\ndiffer from, some, who are either in favor or opposed; whilst some must\r\noppose whatever they themselves do not originate;--and, others again,\r\nhave no doubt been led honestly to entertain a distrust which has\r\nfinally grown into an opposition, through the influence of\r\nmisrepresentations, or from a perversion of facts by those whose\r\ninterests, from some cause, are at variance with its success.\r\n\r\nBut I am quite certain that the whole opposition and indifference to\r\nthis Institution, so far as it may come from the farmers themselves, is\r\nunnatural and fictitious, and will soon pass away as does everything\r\nelse which is built upon such foundation. It is said by some that \"the\r\nInstitution has been a mistake from the beginning;\" that it \"was located\r\nwrong;\" that it \"was not started right;\" that it \"has been badly\r\nmanaged;\" and that it \"is an expensive concern, and will never pay;\" and\r\na great deal more. But it is very easy to say all this, and yet there\r\nmay be very little reality in it, and still less reason.\r\n\r\nLet me here say to the objectors and fault-finders,--suppose all this be\r\ntrue? who _then_ is to blame? Is the Institution itself responsible for\r\nall these mistakes? Or, are they not rather the consequences of\r\nunavoidable and untoward circumstances, magnified and aggravated by\r\n_your_ opposition, and over which its friends and managers could have no\r\npossible control. I admit the probability that the early success of the\r\nCollege would have been more certainly secured, had an old and highly\r\ncultivated farm been purchased for the purpose; but for this the means\r\nwere wanting. You say, perhaps, that College students should not be\r\nrequired to _clear land and dig stumps_. True; but when the officers and\r\nmanagers of such an Institution are _compelled_ to do this, and to reach\r\nthe end desired as best they may through such means, they are certainly\r\nentitled to all praise, and richly deserve the meed of commendation for\r\neven partial success, and which should be all the dearer to us because\r\nof being reached under such adverse circumstances. That the facilities\r\nwhich the College now possesses are inadequate to the proper\r\naccommodation of those who wish to avail themselves of its advantages,\r\nand even to the extent of the limited number of students now belonging\r\nto it, is certainly to be regretted. But this is an evil to be overcome\r\nby the patient and persistent efforts of its friends, and not by the\r\nantagonism and opposition of its enemies; by making the most out of the\r\nlimited means at command, and not by abandoning the whole because the\r\nmeans are not now all we could desire. That its management may have been\r\na matter of criticism with those who have known but little about it, or\r\nwho have taken little or no pains to investigate the facts, is not\r\nstrange; yet, for one, I am clearly of the opinion that--when all the\r\ndifficulties with which it has had to contend, are duly considered--its\r\nmanagement, thus far, has been all that any person could reasonably hope\r\nfor or expect; and more--that its officers and professors are entitled\r\nto great credit and much praise, for securing under so much\r\ndiscouragement, that degree of success which is apparent here even to\r\nthe casual observer; and claim of us, and are entitled to receive at our\r\nhands, a proper and just recognition of their valuable services, and the\r\nfidelity with which they have been rendered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFarmers of Michigan! Be not led astray by such objections as I have\r\nstated, or by any others of a similar import. You have here a noble\r\nInstitution, in faithful and competent hands--one that will soon be of\r\nincalculable value to you--and one, too, that will reflect much credit\r\nnot only upon you, but upon the whole State. And although it may not now\r\nbe all you could wish or desire, yet when we consider what it now is in\r\nview of the difficulties with which it has had to contend, we have a\r\nsure guarantee, that it will yet be a success and will realize all your\r\nreasonable expectations. Let me ask of you, in all earnestness and\r\ncandor, to give it now your warm, your hearty support, so that you may\r\nnot only assist in securing for yourselves and the public the great end\r\nof its establishment, but that you may, by and by, safely, and without\r\nthe fear of successful contradiction, lay claim to the honor of being\r\namong its early friends and upholders. There is something noble and\r\nmagnanimous in rendering substantial aid and support to a cause in the\r\nhour of its weakness and in the time of its need; whilst there is\r\nsomething not only selfish but mean, in stepping forward with proffers\r\nof assistance, and with spurious claims of imaginary or intended favor,\r\nwhen such assistance is no longer needed, and when the heat and burden\r\nof the day has been borne by others; for, be assured, that the time is\r\ncoming when no farmer will covet the distinction of having been among\r\nthe number of the enemies of this Institution.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of our Agricultural College, in connection with an\r\nexperimental farm, are too obvious to every intelligent mind to require\r\nthat I should occupy your time in dwelling upon them. And, when I speak\r\nof an experimental farm, I do not mean a mere model farm, by which a\r\nspecimen of good farming only is exhibited; but, like this, a farm\r\nembracing a variety of soils--adapted to an extensive range of\r\nexperiments--and where the value of the different kinds of grain may be\r\ntested, as well as the relative advantages of different modes of\r\ntillage; the relative effect and value, by actual trial, as well as by\r\nanalysis, of various manures as fertilizers; and the economy of labor;\r\nas well as the comparative value of the different breeds of cattle,\r\nsheep, horses, swine, &c., &c., with a view to the introduction and\r\ndissemination among the farmers of the State, of such as should prove\r\nthe most profitable; or of such as could be most successfully used for\r\nobtaining the most desirable grades. Such a farm as this, under the\r\nefficient and skillful management of its present able and persevering\r\nSuperintendent, cannot fail to be of very great benefit to the farmers\r\nof this State, and should, both as a matter of duty to others and of\r\ninterest to themselves, receive their united and generous support. And I\r\nam firmly of the opinion that when they shall afford this Institution\r\nsuch aid, it will soon become one of the first among our noble\r\ninstitutions of learning, and will be a just cause of pride, not merely\r\nto the farmers themselves, but to every intelligent person throughout\r\nthe whole extent of our noble State.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me invoke, for the future prosperity and success of this\r\nCollege, not merely the liberality of the farmers--or what they may\r\nregard as such--in the payment of a trifling tax for its maintenance,\r\nbut what is of equal importance, and which it has a right to demand in\r\njustice to itself--their earnest advocacy of its claims.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL COLLEGE STUDENTS.\r\n\r\nBut I have already, I fear, trespassed quite too far upon your patience,\r\nand should, perhaps, before this, have relieved you from further\r\ninfliction. Yet seeing before me, many--if not all--of the students of\r\nthis College, I must beg your indulgence for a moment longer, whilst I\r\naddress to them a very few remarks.\r\n\r\nLet me say, then, to you, young gentlemen, that you are now in the\r\nenjoyment of privileges for the acquisition of that knowledge so\r\nessential to success in after life, which were denied to me--and the\r\nabsence of which I have felt as a great and serious loss through the\r\nwhole period of my existence. See to it that you place a just value upon\r\nthese privileges, and that you do not abuse them. Whilst most of you, I\r\ntrust, are fitting yourselves for the employment of farming as an\r\navocation, some, perhaps, may be looking forward to other professions\r\nand pursuits. I, however, on this occasion, must confine my remarks to\r\nthose of the former class.\r\n\r\nAnd to such I would briefly remark, that the value and importance of an\r\nagricultural education to the youth whose lives are to be devoted to the\r\nhighly reputable occupation of farming, begin now to be admitted, and\r\nhappy will it be for our common country, when such education shall be\r\nregarded as a necessity. Labor is no longer degrading, but is creditable\r\nand dignified; and agricultural pursuits are no longer regarded as\r\ndisgraceful or ignoble by any except the fop and the coxcomb, but are of\r\nall employments the most honorable in which men can be engaged. Nor is\r\nit, as has been too often supposed, a cheerless life of toil and\r\nfatigue, but has many substantial and endearing charms. It is also the\r\nfountain-head for the supply of all our wants; and when contrasted with\r\nother employments, its advantages cannot fail to be appreciated. Whilst\r\nthose who seek a profession must be content to spend many weary years of\r\nwasting study--of constant struggle--before they can begin to live, the\r\nfarmer has at once before him, health and quiet, ease and contentment,\r\nas well as the enjoyment of sober pleasures which do not cloy, and\r\nwhilst the chances of those who engage in commercial pursuits are, that\r\nabout _ninety-five_ out of every _one hundred_ are destined to failure,\r\nthe farmer is exempt from such a hazard, for the chances of failure with\r\nhim are found to be only about _four_ in every _one hundred_.\r\n\r\nI do not, of course, in this comparison, include those who, having no\r\nland of their own, are obliged to toil for others as laborers, and who\r\ncannot therefore be ranked as farmers.\r\n\r\nTo the farmer, if each day does bring its labors, it also brings its\r\npleasures; and even as he toils in his dusty fields, he can derive\r\nunalloyed pleasures, not only from the study and care of his bleating\r\nflocks and lowing herds, but from the prospect of an abundant harvest as\r\nhe looks over his fields of waving grain or contemplates his orchards of\r\nrich and luscious fruits. And each day renews to him these pure and\r\nsubstantial pleasures, which afford not only gratification, but health.\r\nWith the farmer there are no all-absorbing cares, no corroding\r\nanxieties, no vitiating excitement. He is measurably freed from the\r\nseductions of enervating pleasures. From the green fields and fresh air\r\nhe drinks constant draughts of inspiration. His great study is, or\r\nshould be, Nature and Nature's God. To him each season has its profits\r\nand its pleasures; for he knows that while he rests or sleeps his fields\r\nare working for him. He is also freed, in a great measure, from the\r\nbaleful influences which attend that false ambition so often excited by\r\nother pursuits.\r\n\r\nMy young friends, when you leave your \"Alma Mater\" and fix upon your\r\nroute for life's journey, let your choice of a profession be carefully\r\nand wisely made; and then, with undeviating course, pursue it steadily\r\nand persistently to the end, for in this only will be found your\r\nreasonable chances of ultimate success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have already detained you and this audience quite too\r\nlong; and with many thanks for your kind and patient attention, I will\r\nnow bring my remarks to a close.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following changes have been made to the text:\r\n\r\nPage 11: \"recently visted\" changed to \"recently visited\".\r\n\r\nPage 12: \"not generally kown\" changed to \"not generally known\".\r\n\r\nPage 19: \"knowlege so essential\" changed to \"knowledge so essential\".",
