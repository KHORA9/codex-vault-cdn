The\r\ntaste which turns into graceful shapes the products of the loom, the\r\nexecutive skill which converts them into convenient and elegant apparel,\r\nwould be powerless without this simple accessory. It is the food of the\r\nneedle, and might almost be called the thread of life to thousands of\r\nthe gentler sex. Yet as it passes through the delicate fingers of\r\nmothers, wives, and daughters, ministering to so many wants, and\r\ncreating so many beautiful superfluities, little thought is bestowed\r\nupon the labor, the care, the dexterity, and the scientific ability\r\nrequired in producing the article. The cultivation of the raw material,\r\nthe processes of picking, ginning, packing, shipping, combing, spinning,\r\nand twisting, are among the most interesting operations in the whole\r\nrange of agriculture and manufactures; and we think the ladies, for\r\nwhose especial convenience such a vast amount of industry, skill, and\r\ntalent is employed, will not be unwilling to trace with us in a familiar\r\nway the progress of this great domestic staple from the field to the\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\nWe therefore claim their attention to the following short treatise, from\r\nwhich, without being fatigued by dry details, they may derive a\r\ntolerably accurate idea of what capital, labor, and science have done to\r\nbring to its present perfection the simple article of sewing-cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF THE COTTON PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cotton-planting season in all the Southern States commences in\r\nApril. The seed is sown in drills, a negro girl following the light\r\nplough which makes the furrow, and throwing the seed into the shallow\r\ntrench as she moves along. A harrow follows to cover up the deposits,\r\nand the work of \"planting\" is completed. About two and a half bushels of\r\nseed are required for an acre of ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn a week or ten days the cotton is \"up,\" when a small plough is run\r\nalong the drills, throwing the earth _from_ the tender plants. The next\r\nprocess is \"scraping;\" in other words, thinning out and earthing up the\r\nplants, so as to leave each in the centre of a little hill, some two\r\nfeet distant from its nearest neighbors. The dexterity and accuracy with\r\nwhich this feat is accomplished are wonderful; and there are few\r\nspectacles more animated and picturesque than that of a hundred active\r\nfield-hands flourishing their bright hoes among the young vegetation,\r\neach striving to outstrip the others in \"hoeing out his row.\" Several\r\nploughings and hoeings intervene between the first of May and the last\r\nof June.\r\n\r\nIn July the cotton fields burst into bloom, _creaming_ the landscape\r\nwith a sea of blossoms, the flower being very nearly of the same tint as\r\nthe ultimate product in its unbleached state. The new beauty thus\r\nimparted to the scenery is, however, ephemeral. The blossoms unfold in\r\nthe night, are in their full glory in the morning, and by noon have\r\nbegun to fade. On the following day their cream-color has changed to a\r\ndull red, and before sunset the petals have fallen, leaving inclosed in\r\nthe calyx the germ or \"form\" of the filamental fruit.\r\n\r\nThe cotton plant, in its progress towards maturity, is liable to the\r\nassaults of as many enemies as the young crocodile on the banks of the\r\nNile; but among them all, the \"army-worm\" is the most destructive. This\r\nworm is produced from the eggs of a chocolate-colored moth of\r\nparticularly harmless and demure appearance; but its name is legion, its\r\nravages terrific. No one who has beheld an invasion of these\r\ncaterpillars can ever forget it. Deep trenches are dug to arrest their\r\nprogress, but these are soon filled up by the accumulating myriads; and\r\nonward move the living destroyers over the bodies of the buried masses.\r\nHuge logs are drawn through the trenches by yokes of oxen, and the\r\nmultitudinous swarms crushed to a paste, of which the effluvium taints\r\nthe air for miles; but still the incursion, if checked, is not arrested.\r\nWhen the planter sees the army-worm in his fields, he is ready to give\r\nup his crop in despair.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of July the \"bolls\" or \"forms\" begin to open; and the\r\ncotton fields, when viewed from a short distance, present the appearance\r\nof being covered with ridges of white surf. Toward the close of the\r\nmonth the _picking_ season commences, and is continued without\r\nintermission until the Christmas holidays. Each field-hand is supplied\r\nwith a basket and a bag. The basket is placed at the end of the cotton\r\nrow, and the bag, as fast as filled, is emptied into it. It is a\r\npleasant sight, on \"the old plantation,\" to see the pickers returning at\r\nnightfall from their work, with their well-filled baskets picturesquely\r\npoised upon their woolly heads. Falling into line with the stoutest in\r\nthe van, they move along through the twilight, too tired to talk or\r\nsing, anxious only to deposit their store in the packing-house, and\r\nretire to their \"quarters\" to rest. A first-rate hand will pick from\r\nthree hundred to three hundred and fifty pounds of cotton per day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe next process is the \"ginning,\" or separation of the cotton from the\r\nseeds. The invention of the cotton-gin by Eli Whitney, a New England\r\nyouth, in 1793, marked a new epoch in the cotton trade, and at once more\r\nthan quadrupled the value of the article as a national staple. Arkwright\r\nhad already introduced the spinning-frame, and through the genial\r\ninfluence of these two great inventions, a pound of cotton, formerly\r\nspun tediously by hand into a thread of five hundred feet, was\r\nlengthened into a filament of _one hundred and fifty miles_; and the\r\nvalue of our cotton exports was increased in sixty years from fifty\r\nthousand to one hundred and twelve millions of dollars!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACKING PRESS.]\r\n\r\nAfter the \"ginning\" comes the \"baling\" of the cotton, which ends the\r\nlabor bestowed upon it on the plantation. In this process powerful\r\nscrew-presses are employed. The cotton is inclosed in Kentucky bagging,\r\nand the contents of each bale are compressed by the screw almost to the\r\nsolidity of stone. The cotton is now ready for market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nToward the close of the packing season there are jolly times on the\r\nplantation. Fox-hunting and racing are the order of the day. The\r\nSouthern planter, like the \"fine old English gentleman,\" opens house to\r\nall, and all goes \"merry as a marriage bell.\" Sambo rubs up his old\r\nmusket, and is out after the ducks, while Dinah's shining face wears an\r\nextra gloss in anticipation of the holidays. Throughout the holidays\r\nthere is high festival in the negro quarters. \"The shovel and the hoe\"\r\nare laid down, and the fiddle is continually going. So ends the cotton\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShipment on the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cotton, being packed, is to be sent to market. For this purpose it\r\nis \"hauled,\" generally by oxen, to the nearest landing on the river,\r\nwhere the bales are rolled down the banks and stowed on board freight\r\nboats bound to New Orleans or Mobile. This process is technically called\r\n\"bumping.\" There are certain plantations famous for the tenacious and\r\nbeautiful quality of their cotton, from which the supplies for DICK &\r\nSONS' celebrated sewing-cotton mills at Glasgow are principally derived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDelivery and Re-shipment at New Orleans.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to describe the scene of bustle and seeming\r\nconfusion presented by the levee at New Orleans when the bulk of the new\r\ncrop begins to come in. The songs and clamor of the negro stevedores, at\r\nwork in the holds and on the decks of the vessels; the sharp\r\nauthoritative expletives of the overseers and masters; the eager\r\nconversations of the merchants, and the preternatural activity into\r\nwhich the occasion seems to have spurred all the energies of Southern\r\nlife, are to Northern ears and eyes at once amusing and confounding. But\r\norder reigns amidst this seeming chaos. The Mississippi boats are\r\nrapidly relieved of their bulky cargoes, and the cotton is warehoused or\r\nre-shipped, as the case may be, with marvellous celerity. Generally the\r\nshipments for the Clyde Mills, Glasgow, are among the first of the\r\nseason; and the primest article in the market is always selected for\r\nDICK & SONS by the New Orleans agents of the firm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DICK & SONS' CLYDE THREAD-MILLS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival at Glasgow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe view of the CLYDE THREAD-MILLS, furnished by our engraver from\r\naccurate drawings taken on the spot, affords a very good idea of the\r\nextensive manufactory of DICK & SONS, from which this country is now\r\nsupplied with the most perfect, even, and tenacious sewing-cotton made\r\nin the world. The cotton for the mills, after having been unloaded and\r\ninspected by the revenue officers, is conveyed at once to the mills,\r\nwhere there is an immense amount of warehouse room for the raw material,\r\nindependent of the space devoted to machinery and the storage of the\r\nmanufactured article. Of the latter, however, there is never a large\r\naccumulation, the active and ever-increasing demand taxing to the utmost\r\nthe facilities of production, great as they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manufacturing, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nA full description of the processes of scutching, carding, spinning,\r\ntwisting, bleaching, and spooling, through all of which the cotton\r\npasses before it is packed for exportation in the form of thread, would\r\nrequire more space than we can devote to them in this treatise, and,\r\nmoreover, would be rather dry reading for the ladies, for whose\r\ninformation and amusement this little publication is intended. It is\r\nsufficient to say, that all the latest improvements in machinery, in\r\neach of the above branches, have been introduced at the Clyde Works; and\r\nthat as regards the perfection of their mechanical facilities, as well\r\nas in point of capacity, they have no rivals in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManufactured Article in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consignments of DICK & SONS' spool-cotton to this city are on a\r\nscale of magnitude which those who have never reflected upon the immense\r\nand universal consumption of the article would scarcely believe. The\r\nbulk of the importations is received by the Collins' line of steamers,\r\nand delivered at the Collins' wharf, whence it is conveyed to the New\r\nYork agency of the firm, 51 DEY-STREET. To the trade it is unnecessary\r\nto say, that DICK & SONS' _six-cord spool-cotton_ is the best in the\r\nmarket; and ladies generally are aware that in strength, uniformity of\r\nthickness, and closeness of fibre, it is superior to any other\r\nsewing-thread in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Dick, senior, has probably had more experience as a manufacturer of\r\nthe article than any other man living. Prior to commencing business on\r\nhis own account he had been for nearly thirty years the manager of a\r\nfactory celebrated for producing a superior description of\r\nsewing-cotton, also well known in the United States. Hence the cotton of\r\nDICK & SONS came into the market with a ready-made popularity. The name\r\nof Mr. DICK was a guarantee of its excellence, and a large demand for\r\nit spontaneously sprang up in the United States, Canada, the West\r\nIndies, and the British possessions in India, and throughout the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nInfinite pains are taken to retain for the article the celebrity it has\r\nacquired. Every spool is inspected before it leaves the factory at\r\nGlasgow, so that no defective specimens can possibly reach the hands of\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the culture of cotton, and of its application to the uses\r\nof man, forms an almost romantic episode in the annals of agriculture,\r\ncommerce, and manufactures. We have already mentioned the extraordinary\r\nimpetus given to its production, sale, and use by the introduction of\r\nWhitney's saw-gin, for separating the seeds from the wool, in the years\r\n1793 and 1794. Since that time the progress of the demand and\r\nconsumption has been no less wonderful.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 the export rose from 187,000 lbs., the sum total for the\r\nprevious year, to 1,601,760 lbs. The next year it was over 6,000,000\r\nlbs. In 1800 it had advanced to about 18,000,000 lbs., and in 1810 to\r\nupwards of 93,000,000 lbs. The last returns before us are for 1852, when\r\nthe export of the short staple variety alone exceeded one thousand one\r\nhundred millions of pounds! To this aggregate we suppose about one\r\nhundred millions of pounds may be added for the sea-island and other\r\nlong-fibred cottons.\r\n\r\nIt may well be doubted whether among all the fabrics into which this\r\nenormous amount of raw material is converted there is one more valuable\r\nthan sewing-cotton. We think if the question were put to the ladies\r\nto-morrow, whether the textile fabrics produced from cotton, or cotton\r\nsewing-thread, were the most indispensable to their comfort and\r\nconvenience, every thimbled hand would be held up in favor of the\r\nlatter. Sewing-silk is too expensive for ordinary exigencies, and linen\r\nthread cannot be spun of the same smooth and even fibre as cotton\r\nthread; and besides, being liable to knot and twist, is apt to cut the\r\nlighter and more fragile products of the loom. Abolish sewing-cotton,\r\nand you abolish muslin embroidery and innumerable delicate and\r\nfairy-like embellishments of female loveliness, which taste and fashion\r\nhave endorsed.\r\n\r\nEvery lady is by habit a connoisseur in the article. She examines the\r\nspools with a critical eye; she tries the strength of the thread; she\r\npasses it through her fingers to test its evenness and compactness, and\r\nwhen seated at her work, detects in a moment any defects which may have\r\nbeen overlooked by the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nTo this ordeal the six-cord cotton-thread of DICK & SONS is cheerfully\r\nsubmitted. It challenges inspection and comparison. There is little\r\nnecessity, however, for an appeal to the ladies in relation to its good\r\nqualities, for they have them already at their fingers' ends.",
