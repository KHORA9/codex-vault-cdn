B. LIPPINCOTT COMPANY\r\n  PHILADELPHIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carnegie Institution of Washington has already published several\r\nmonographs upon paleobiological subjects, written by its research\r\nassociates, Hay, Wieland, and Case. Each author has dealt with the\r\nsubject-matter of his particular field, but each has brought to bear upon\r\nhis work common factors which have placed his labors upon a broader basis\r\nthan the mere morphological descriptions of fossil forms of life. Case\r\nhas published four monographs upon the morphology and taxonomy of the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous vertebrates of North America, and has followed these\r\nby a fifth, in which all the known factors bearing upon the development of\r\nthe life were assembled in an effort to discuss the paleogeography of the\r\nperiod. In his conception paleogeography is a very broad term, involving\r\nnot only a study of the distribution of land, water, and life in any one\r\ninterval of time, but a consideration of all the factors in the extremely\r\ncomplex inter-relations of organic and inorganic matter and causes which\r\ninfluence the development of each part.\r\n\r\nGeologists and paleobiologists have alike suffered in their interpretation\r\nof past conditions, because of their lack of knowledge of the work\r\ndone by others. Stratigraphy may not be interpreted from the preserved\r\nfossils without a knowledge of biological laws, and the formations of the\r\nearth may not safely be rearranged to account for the present or past\r\ndistribution of life without a knowledge of geological processes.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that such work is beyond the possibilities of any one man;\r\nit is rather the work of a group of men, each broadly trained and each\r\nmaster of his own field and able to contribute to and criticize the\r\nwork of his fellows. Nowhere could close cooperation of this kind be\r\nbetter accomplished than under a system such as the Carnegie Institution\r\nof Washington has developed, whereby the research associates of the\r\nInstitution and others of its staff may call in the assistance of men in\r\nrelated fields. Already the value of this procedure is apparent in the\r\nresults accomplished by cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe following monograph, by Dr. Roy L. Moodie, adds an important link\r\nto the series of paleobiological publications of the Institution and is\r\nclosely connected with the work already done upon the Permo-Carboniferous\r\nvertebrates, since it supplies a description of the life of the period\r\nimmediately preceding. It is hoped that the volume will contribute\r\nin no small measure to an understanding of the broader problems of\r\npaleogeography and the recognition of the mutual problems of the\r\npaleobiologists and the geologists.\r\n\r\n                                                                E. C. Case.\r\n\r\n  University of Michigan, _March 15, 1916_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin of land vertebrates, which has appealed so\r\nstrongly to students of fossil Amphibia, is by no means solved from the\r\nmaterial furnished by the Coal Measures of North America. The Amphibia\r\nare, however, well known from several localities in the Coal Measures of\r\nthis continent, where skeletons have been recovered which are sufficiently\r\nwell preserved to afford a fair knowledge of their anatomy. The specimens\r\nrescued from the dumps of the old mines are regrettably few in comparison\r\nwith the number that must have been burned as fuel, or carried down the\r\nslopes as silt. Yet scanty as is the material thus collected, it is of\r\ngreat importance, because it represents such an early period in the\r\nrecorded history of the air-breathing vertebrates.\r\n\r\nThe amphibian fauna in the Coal Measures of North America is represented\r\nby several hundred individual specimens, preserved in various museums. All\r\nof the collections have been available in the preparation of this memoir,\r\nwith the exception of those species from Nova Scotia which are preserved\r\nin the Peter Redpath Museum of McGill University and in the British\r\nMuseum of Natural History. The European material, which has been used in\r\ncomparisons with the American forms, has been studied chiefly from the\r\nliterature, although there have been available a series of specimens of\r\n_Branchiosaurus amblystomus_ Credner, from Saxony, presented by the late\r\nProfessor Credner, and a single specimen of _Archegosaurus_ from Dr. von\r\nHuene, of Tübingen.\r\n\r\nThe collection which has been of the greatest value is that at the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, chiefly assembled by Dr. J. S.\r\nNewberry from the dumps of the coal mines at Linton, Ohio, while he was\r\nin charge of the Ohio Geological Survey (1869-1884). This collection, a\r\npart of which is at Columbia University, furnished Cope with the most of\r\nhis type material for the \"Synopsis of the Extinct Batrachia from the Coal\r\nMeasures\" (123).[A] This entire collection, including all of Professor\r\nCope's types and representing many new and hitherto undescribed forms,\r\nwas generously placed at the writer's disposal for a period of five years\r\nthrough the kindness of Dr. Bashford Dean and Dr. Louis Hussakof. Dr.\r\nHussakof made a trip through the Linton region and his description of the\r\nplace occupied by the \"Old Diamond Mine\" is given on page 16.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The numbers in parentheses refer to the bibliography at the\r\nend of this volume.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting collection of air-breathing vertebrates from the Coal\r\nMeasures, representing 19 species, is in the U. S. National Museum (464).\r\nThis is chiefly the collection of Mr. R. D. Lacoe and includes specimens\r\nfrom Mazon Creek, Illinois, from Kansas, and from Linton, Ohio. It is\r\nespecially important in that it contains the skeleton (plate 20, fig. 3)\r\nof _the oldest known reptile_, _Eosaurus copei_ Williston (Jour. Geol.,\r\nXVI, 295). It contains also, besides many of Cope's types, new forms which\r\nhave been described by the writer (464, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 478,\r\n479). Dr. Stuart Weller first secured the use of this collection for me,\r\nand its continued use has been granted by Dr. C. D. Walcott. Mr. Charles\r\nGilmore has called my attention to several interesting specimens and has\r\nkindly loaned them for description.\r\n\r\nA small but interesting collection of Mazon Creek Amphibia is that of the\r\nPeabody Museum of Yale University. Through the courtesy of the officers\r\nof this museum the writer was permitted to study these specimens and\r\nwas given a grant for their illustration. The results of that study\r\nare contained in a previous paper (478) and in the present memoir. Dr.\r\nSchuchert has offered suggestions as to the environmental conditions of\r\nthe ancient Amphibia.\r\n\r\nA few specimens of Coal Measures Amphibia are at the Walker Museum,\r\nUniversity of Chicago. This collection includes the type of _Micrerpeton\r\ncaudatum_ Moodie, the first branchiosaur discovered in the western\r\nhemisphere, and a few specimens from Linton, Ohio.\r\n\r\nA single specimen of _Amphibamus grandiceps_ Cope, very beautifully\r\npreserved, is in the possession of Mr. L. E. Daniels, of Rolling Prairie,\r\nIndiana. This specimen has been studied and described by Hay (316) and by\r\nthe writer (462, 469, 478).\r\n\r\nThe works of Cope and Dawson, published between 1860 and 1897, on the\r\nAmphibia from the Coal Measures, have been indispensable in the present\r\nstudy. It has been necessary to rely on the published descriptions and\r\nphotographs of the interesting fauna from Nova Scotia, since it has not\r\nbeen possible for me to visit and examine the types preserved in the Peter\r\nRedpath Museum of McGill University and in the British Museum of Natural\r\nHistory. It has been possible to check Dawson's work, to a certain extent,\r\nby a study of a series of excellent photographs of the types of Coal\r\nMeasures Amphibia collected by Dawson and Lyell and described by Dawson\r\nand Owen. The descriptions of these authors have been drawn on for the\r\ndiscussion of the Canadian forms.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions given below have been made full and complete in the\r\nbelief that in this way our knowledge of these interesting vertebrates\r\nmay be advanced. Many of the species have been described elsewhere in\r\nscattered papers by various authors. These descriptions have been revised\r\nand verified and are collected here in monographic form. The work is a\r\nmorphologic and taxonomic revision of the Amphibia from the Coal Measures\r\nof North America. Especial attention has been paid to the factors which\r\nhave been most active in the evolution of the group, so far as these\r\nfactors may be interpreted. It is the author's hope that this review may\r\nopen up the field for many more workers, since we are just beginning to\r\nlearn about the evolution of this group of vertebrates.\r\n\r\nThe trustees of the Elizabeth Thompson Science Fund allotted a grant for\r\nthe present investigation. This aid has enabled the writer to present his\r\nwork in much better form than would have been possible otherwise. Dr.\r\nS. W. Williston has offered many suggestions and criticisms which have\r\nbeen gratefully adopted. It is with the greatest sense of pleasure that\r\nthe author dedicates this memoir to his teacher and friend. After the\r\nmanuscript was completed the author enjoyed a visit from Mr. D. M. S.\r\nWatson, of King's College, London, whose knowledge of the European and\r\nAfrican forms enabled him to offer several very valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting also to express my indebtedness to the Carnegie Institution\r\nof Washington for the privilege of publishing my work in the series of\r\nmonographs contributed by Dr. E. C. Case, dealing with the anatomy and\r\nrelationships of the early land vertebrates of North America.\r\n\r\n  Roy Lee Moodie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                      PAGE.\r\n\r\n  Prefatory Note                                                       iii\r\n\r\n  Preface                                                               vi\r\n\r\n  List of Illustrations                                             viii-x\r\n\r\n  CHAP.\r\n\r\n      I.

The difference in age between the\r\nchief amphibian-bearing deposits of North America and Europe is not\r\ngreat, although it has been asserted that _Pholidogaster_ and its\r\nallied fauna, described by Huxley from Scotland (331), is much older,\r\nprobably Mississippian. It is interesting to note that these earliest\r\nrepresentatives of the Amphibia in Scotland are all temnospondyles, of\r\nwhich there are very few representatives in the Coal Measures of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe forms so far described from the North American Coal Measures present\r\na very high degree of development and differentiation, the earliest known\r\nspecies being already specialized and well adapted for various modes of\r\nlife. As far back in geological time as the middle Coal Measures, when\r\nthe first well-defined forms are known, environmental conditions had\r\neffected a wide diversity of structure within the group. Thus, early in\r\nthe geological history of the land vertebrates, we have, among the Coal\r\nMeasures Amphibia, various forms which had specialized into strictly\r\naquatic, terrestrial, subterrestrial, and arboreal, or at least partly\r\narboreal. Specialization had extended to the loss of limbs, ribs, and\r\nventral armature in a few species, and to the acquirement of claws,\r\nrunning legs, or a long propelling tail with expanded neural and hæmal\r\narches in others. The forms range in size from small creatures less than\r\nan inch in length to large species which must have attained a length of\r\nseveral feet. A rather interesting parallel, though of no phylogenetic\r\nsignificance, can be drawn between the Amphibia of the North American\r\nCoal Measures and the reptiles of to-day. The snakes are represented by\r\nthe limbless, snake-like forms, such as _Ptyonius_ and _Phlegethontia_.\r\nThe lizards find their counterpart in the Hylonomidæ and the Tuditanidæ.\r\nNo known characters of these animals tend to ally them directly with any\r\nknown group of fishes, except in the most general way. These facts all\r\nindicate a long antecedent history for the amphibian group or else a\r\npreceding period of greatly accelerated development of which we now know\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe Amphibia whose remains have been brought to light from the Coal\r\nMeasures have hitherto been regarded as pertaining to a single order, the\r\nStegocephalia, characterized by the completely roofed-over cranium and a\r\nlarge parasphenoid. The writer (469) had previously assigned 5 suborders\r\nto the group: the Branchiosauria, Microsauria, Aistopoda, Temnospondylia,\r\nand Stereospondylia. All of these groups are represented in the Coal\r\nMeasures of North America. It has seemed inadvisable, in the light of our\r\npresent knowledge of the Amphibia, to retain these 5 groups as suborders,\r\nand, in the revised scheme of classification which has been published\r\nelsewhere (469), they are given the rank of orders all excepting the\r\nAistopoda, which are now regarded by the writer as specialized Microsauria.\r\n\r\nThe recent Caudata are possibly represented in the North American Coal\r\nMeasures by forms which may be assigned tentatively to the Proteida.\r\nSuch forms as _Cocytinus gyrinoides_, _Hyphasma lævis_, and _Erierpeton\r\nbranchialis_ possibly represent this group in the Pennsylvanian. This\r\nrelationship is based chiefly on the structure of the hyobranchial\r\napparatus and on the general structure of the species. The three\r\nabove-mentioned species are, however, very insufficiently known, and\r\nthe relationship can hardly be regarded as more than suggested by the\r\ncharacters which are at hand.\r\n\r\nThe Salientia, or frogs, may possibly have their ancestral type in _Pelion\r\nlyelli_, the first known species from the Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\nOddly enough, among the hundreds of specimens collected later from this\r\nhorizon, not a fragment can be identified with this species. The type\r\nspecimen is unique, and although incomplete its characters are suggestive.\r\n\r\nThe Branchiosauria are represented in North America by four species:\r\n_Micrerpeton caudatum_, _Eumicrerpeton parvum_, _Mazonerpeton\r\nlongicaudatum_, and _M. costatum_. Three other genera which occur in North\r\nAmerica have been placed (642) in this group, but they do not belong\r\nthere, for reasons given below. The branchiosaurs were salamander-like\r\nin appearance. They were naked, with the exception of small ovoid scales\r\non the back and the chevron-shaped armature of the ventral surface, the\r\nlatter being almost universally present among the Paleozoic Amphibia. They\r\nwere adapted for life in the water for at least the early part of their\r\nexistence, as is shown by the possession of gills on many of the late\r\nCarboniferous and early Permian forms of Europe. The group is, without\r\ndoubt, ancestral to the modern Caudata. No branchiosaurians have been\r\ndescribed elsewhere from so low in the geological series as those here\r\ngiven and they are the first and only evidence of the occurrence of the\r\ngroup in the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe Microsauria are represented in the Coal Measures by numerous\r\nforms which are usually characterized as lizard-like animals with a\r\nwell-developed ventral scutellation. Other characters, such as the\r\npossession of lateral-line grooves on the cranium, the arrangement of the\r\ncranial elements, and the condition of the ribs, will be discussed further\r\non. The pectoral arch is well developed and is composed of five dermal\r\nbones plus the regular skeletal elements. The skeletal membrane bones are\r\nsculptured after the manner of those of the cranium. The bodies of the\r\nanimals were, in a few cases, covered with scales; but most of them appear\r\nto have been completely naked, even the ventral armature being absent in\r\nsome cases. The ventral scutellation was especially strong and highly\r\ndeveloped in some of the forms; _e.g._, in the genera _Saurerpeton_ and\r\n_Sauropleura_. The vertebræ are uniformly of the hour-glass or notochordal\r\ntype. This is so generally the case that the characters of the vertebræ\r\nand ribs are taken as the chief diagnostic characters of the major\r\ngroups. Various peculiarities are seen among the Microsauria, such as the\r\ndevelopment of horns in various genera which are, apparently, related.\r\nThe order seems to have gone completely out of existence during the early\r\nPermian, and if their descendants continued on as reptiles, as has been\r\nsuggested (469), we do not know the intermediate stages.\r\n\r\nThe Aistopoda are without doubt specialized microsaurs, and, in the\r\nopinion of the writer, are not entitled to separate rank. Some of these\r\nforms reached a high degree of specialization. One American species has\r\nthe skeleton reduced to a long, slender head and a slender series of\r\nelongate vertebræ, all other parts of the skeleton, even the ventral\r\narmature, being absent. The proportions attained by this species,\r\n_Phlegethontia linearis_ Cope, recall those of the coach-whip snake,\r\n_Zamenis flagellum_ Shaw, of the western plains. Some of the so-called\r\nAistopoda have been credited by Fritsch with the possession of peculiar\r\nclasping organs, \"Kammplatten.\" Newberry has written of the discovery of\r\nsimilar structures in the Ohio Coal Measures (498), but the statement of\r\nthe actual association of these \"Kammplatten\" needs confirmation. Dr. R.\r\nH. Traquair wrote to the author under date of April 28, 1909:\r\n\r\n\"I maintain that the association of a bundle of 'Kammplatten' with\r\na specimen of _Ophiderpeton_ in the Bohemian gas coal was entirely\r\n_accidental_. Of such pitfalls the paleontologist has to beware or serious\r\nmistakes may be the consequence, as has happened more than once. I must,\r\nhowever, publish a short paper on the Kammplatten, for I think I know what\r\nthey are now.\"\r\n\r\nFritsch, however, has very clearly figured a nearly complete specimen\r\nof _Ophiderpeton_ (251, Bd. IV) as possessing the Kammplatten in place\r\nnear the cloaca, where he suggests they may have served the function of\r\naccessory copulatory organs or claspers.\r\n\r\nThe Temnospondylia are represented by scanty remains of species from\r\nIllinois, Pennsylvania, and Nova Scotia. The forms belonging to this group\r\nare all relatively large, and they had a wide geographical distribution\r\nduring the Permian. This group contains two types of vertebræ, known\r\nas the embolomerous and the rachitomous, both of which are present in\r\nthe Coal Measures. Such forms as _Eosaurus_, _Baphetes_, _Eobaphetes\r\nkansensis_, _Macrerpeton_, and _Dendrerpeton_ are regarded tentatively as\r\ntemnospondyles, but there is no definite assurance that they are such.\r\nIt is possible that _Eosaurus_ is a stereospondyle, but the species is\r\ntoo incompletely known for a definite statement to be made. The close\r\nresemblance between the vertebræ of _Eosaurus_ and _Anthracosaurus_ has\r\nbeen noted by Huxley (332).\r\n\r\nThe Stereospondylia are very scantily represented in the Coal Measures,\r\nif at all. _Eosaurus_ may belong here as indicated above. The tooth and\r\ncranial fragments discovered and described by Williston from the Coal\r\nMeasures of Kansas may represent a stereospondyle as he states (608),\r\nbut the evidence is incomplete. A fragment of a large rib (plate 22,\r\nfig. 4) of a species from Linton, Ohio, otherwise unknown, may be a\r\nstereospondyle. We would expect an early development for this group,\r\nbut it is' an interesting fact that no stereospondyles are known\r\ndefinitely before the Triassic, during which period they had an extensive\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE DISCOVERY OF AMPHIBIA IN THE COAL MEASURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir William Logan, in 1841, discovered in the Coal Measures of Horton's\r\nBluff, Nova Scotia, some tracks of Amphibia which he carried to London\r\nand which Sir Richard Owen pronounced to be undoubted \"reptilian\" tracks.\r\nThis fact was published in 1842 (380) and was the first recorded evidence\r\nof the occurrence of land vertebrates in the Carboniferous rocks of the\r\nworld. To these tracks Sir William Dawson later gave the name of _Hylopus\r\nlogani_.\r\n\r\nTwo years later Dr. Gergens (291) wrote a letter to Professor Bronn, the\r\nfounder and one of the editors of the \"Neues Jahrbuch für Mineralogie,\r\nGeologic und Paleontologie,\" in regard to an important discovery in the\r\nCarboniferous rocks of Germany. The letter is of such exceptional interest\r\nin connection with the history of the fossil Amphibia that it is given\r\nhere:\r\n\r\n  \"In dem Brandschiefer von Münsterappel in Rhein-Bayern habe ich in\r\n  vorigen Jahre einen Salamander aufgefunden und Hrn. H. v. Meyer in\r\n  Frankfurt zur näheren Untersuchung und Beschreibung übergeben;--Gehört\r\n  dieser Schiefer der Kohlen-Formation?--in diesem Falle ware der Fund\r\n  in anderen Hinsicht interessant.\"\r\n\r\nThe form discovered by Dr. Gergens and described by Hermann von Meyer as\r\nan amphibian is a little puzzling as to its characters. Miall (449, p.\r\n183) says that the remains are too imperfect for close definition. The\r\nform, as figured, resembles an immature branchiosaurian, as one is at once\r\nreminded, from an examination of Von Ammon's _Branchiosaurus caducus_ (7,\r\nTaf. IV, fig. 1). In 1844 Dr. Alfred King (356) announced the discovery of\r\n\"reptilian\" footprints in the Carboniferous of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe next announcement of fossil Amphibia was made by Goldfuss (296), who\r\nin 1847 described the famous _Archegosaurus_ from the upper Carboniferous\r\nof Germany, from the remains which had as long ago as 1777 been\r\nregarded as a fish. Two years later Isaac Lea (371) announced to the\r\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science, through Buckland,\r\nthe discovery of footprints in the old Red Sandstone (Mauch Chunk) of\r\nPennsylvania. These objects occur not rarely in the Mauch Chunk shales,\r\nwhich are of upper Mississippian age. Barrell (21, p. 460) records the\r\nfinding of imperfect tracks in the same beds, and Rogers (Geology of\r\nPennsylvania, pt. II, 1856, p. 831) records three unnamed varieties from\r\n2,200 feet below the top of the Mauch Chunk. Branson (50) has recorded\r\nthe finding of other amphibian footprints from the Mississippian of Giles\r\nCounty, Virginia.\r\n\r\nLyell and Dawson (396), in 1853, read a paper before the Geological\r\nSociety of London, in which they announced the discovery of remains of\r\nAmphibia in the Coal Measures of North America, although Dawson had\r\npreviously, in 1850, discovered the skull of _Baphetes planiceps_ Owen,\r\nwhich was not described until the latter part of 1853 (509). The specimen\r\nhad lain unnoticed in the collection of the Geological Society for more\r\nthan two years. When, however, the announcement was made by Lyell and\r\nDawson of the discovery of Amphibia in the Coal Measures of Nova Scotia,\r\nso much interest was excited that the skull, now known as _Baphetes\r\nplaniceps_, was brought to light by the president or secretary and was\r\ndescribed (509) by Sir Richard Owen. The only other known evidences of\r\nland vertebrates in the Paleozoic of North America, up to this time, had\r\nbeen the footprints described by Lea and King from the Mississippian\r\n(Mauch Chunk) and Pennsylvanian of Pennsylvania. The specimens presented\r\nto the Geological Society of London by Lyell and Dawson were found at the\r\nSouth Joggins, Nova Scotia, and consisted of scutes, a few limb bones, a\r\nfragment of a jaw, and a few vertebræ, a part of which were associated.\r\nThe remains were found quite accidentally and unexpectedly by them in\r\nthe petrified trunks of ancient Sigillariæ which were exposed on the\r\ncoast. Dr. Jeffries Wyman, of Harvard College, had examined these remains\r\nin the United States and had pronounced (638) them to be amphibian,\r\ncomparing them with similar elements in _Menobranchus_. On the arrival\r\nof the specimens in England they were submitted to Sir Richard Owen,\r\nwho suggested the name (514) _Dendrerpeton acadianum_ and compared the\r\nremains with _Archegosaurus_. At the same meeting of the London Geological\r\nSociety, Owen read a paper on a small amphibian (508) from the British\r\nCarboniferous which he named _Parabatrachus_. Subsequent discoveries have\r\nshown, however, that this form belongs among the fishes. At the meeting\r\nof the Geological Society held in the latter part of the same year Owen\r\nannounced (509) further discoveries in the Nova Scotia coal beds.\r\n\r\nHermann von Meyer (436), in 1857, described numerous stegocephalian\r\nremains from the upper Carboniferous of Germany. Dr. Jeffries Wyman, in\r\nthe same year, described (639) a new form of amphibian from Linton, Ohio.\r\nThis form he called _Raniceps lyelli_, but as the name _Raniceps_ had been\r\npreoccupied by Cuvier for a genus of gadid fishes, Wyman later (1868)\r\nchanged the name to _Pelion_. This was the first form to be described from\r\nthe locality at Linton, which has since yielded the remains of half a\r\nhundred species.\r\n\r\nDawson (204), in 1859, made a further contribution to the fauna of\r\nNova Scotia by the description of _Hylonomus_ and other species of\r\n_Dendrerpeton_ from the South Joggins deposits. Huxley (331), in 1862,\r\ndescribed the genera _Loxomma_ and _Pholidogaster_ from the Carboniferous\r\nof Scotland. The same year Owen made a further contribution (514) to the\r\nfauna of the Nova Scotia beds, and Huxley (332) discussed the anatomy of\r\n_Anthracosaurus_ from Scotland. Marsh (404), in the next year, described,\r\nas an enaliosaurian, the interesting _Eosaurus acadianus_ from the Nova\r\nScotia Coal Measures, basing the species on two vertebræ, apparently from\r\nthe dorsal region. The vertebræ resemble the stereospondylous type, and\r\nHuxley (332) called attention to the similarity of these vertebræ to those\r\nof _Anthracosaurus_.\r\n\r\nCope (105), in 1865, began his researches among the Coal Measures Amphibia\r\nof North America by the description of _Amphibamus grandiceps_ from the\r\nMazon Creek shales of Illinois. Ten years later (123) he published a\r\ncomplete synopsis of the Carboniferous Amphibia of North America, with\r\nespecial reference to the Linton, Ohio, species, illustrating many of\r\nthe forms now known from Linton. Between the years 1865 and 1897, Cope\r\npublished numerous papers (105-177) on the Amphibia of the Paleozoic, and\r\nto his researches is due a large part of our knowledge of these forms.\r\n\r\nGreat credit is due Dr. J. S. Newberry (495, 498) for the enthusiasm and\r\ninterest which his collections of Coal Measures Amphibia exhibit. He\r\nfurnished Cope with the majority of the type material described by him,\r\nand it was through Dr. Newberry's instrumentality that the \"Synopsis of\r\nthe Extinct Batrachia from the Coal Measures\" (123) was published. The\r\nmaterial which Dr. Newberry had collected he took with him from Ohio to\r\nColumbia University, New York, and a part of his collection still remains\r\nin the geological collection of that institution, although the greater\r\nportion has been transferred to the American Museum of Natural History.\r\nThe Newberry collection forms the basis for the larger part of this memoir.\r\n\r\nBetween the year 1853 and the early nineties, Dawson continued (200-223)\r\nhis researches on the Amphibia of the Coal Measures of Nova Scotia. His\r\nmost notable single work (208) is \"The Air-Breathers of the Coal Period,\"\r\npublished in Montreal in 1863, in which he gives a complete account of\r\nthe forms then known from Canada, attempting some restorations. Since his\r\ndeath there have been no new species described from Canada, and, so far as\r\nI can learn, there has been no further collecting at the South Joggins.\r\n\r\nRecently G. F. Matthew (409) has rearranged the classification of\r\namphibian footprints from Nova Scotia. Jaekel (347) has described very\r\nfully the remains of _Diceratosaurus punctolineatus_ (Cope) from Linton,\r\nOhio, basing the new genus on a species described by Cope as a member of\r\n_Ceraterpeton_. Hay (316) has added to the knowledge of the anatomy of\r\n_Amphibamus_, his most interesting contribution being the detection of\r\nlong, curved ribs in this form. This character excludes the species from\r\nthe order Branchiosauria and shows the relationship of the form to the\r\nHylonomidæ and the Microsauria. Schwarz (540) has described the characters\r\nof the vertebræ and ribs of several genera of the Coal Measures Amphibia\r\nand has (541) offered his views as to the descent of the Amphibia, based\r\nentirely on his work on the vertebræ of species from North America and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nSince 1908 the writer has published several contributions (457-489) on the\r\nAmphibia from the Coal Measures of North America. The results of these\r\ninvestigations are given in this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSTRATIGRAPHIC AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AMPHIBIA IN THE COAL MEASURES\r\nOF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are but four localities in North America which have furnished any\r\nnotable remains of Amphibia in the Coal Measures. These are, in the order\r\nof their discovery, the deposits at the South Joggins, Nova Scotia; the\r\nLinton, Ohio, Coal Measures; the Mazon Creek, Illinois, shales; and the\r\nCannelton slates near Cannelton, Pennsylvania. There are, however, several\r\nother localities on the continent which have furnished evidences of\r\nAmphibia in the Coal Measures. The principal one of the latter localities\r\nis doubtfully of Coal Measures age, although recent discoveries would tend\r\nto show it is such. The deposits in question, those of the Clepsydrops\r\nshales of Vermilion County, Illinois, have, heretofore, been regarded\r\nas Permian, but the discovery of similar remains in rocks of undoubted\r\nPennsylvanian age in Pennsylvania would seem to indicate that the Illinois\r\ndeposits were contemporaneous with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Map of Upper Pennsylvanian showing land and water\r\nconditions under which the Coal Measures amphibian fauna lived. It will be\r\nnoted that the chief deposits which have furnished amphibian remains are\r\non the margins of the heavily shaded areas. (After Schuchert.)\r\n\r\nExplanation of symbols: Lands are white. Water areas are lined. Formation\r\noutcrops are black or dotted. Known shore-lines are solid lines; probable\r\nones broken. Vertical lines in middle of continent indicate Gulf marine.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) The deposits in Vermilion County, Illinois, lie along the north bank\r\nof Salt Fork Creek, at the tip of the \"Horseshoe Bend,\" about 2 miles\r\nsouth of Oakwood, Illinois. They were discovered by Dr. J. C. Winslow,\r\nof Danville, in 1875. The remains discovered by him were forwarded to\r\nProfessor Cope for identification. Later the deposits were thoroughly\r\nexplored by W. F. E. Gurley, and the specimens collected by him are now\r\npreserved (86) in Walker Museum, University of Chicago. In 1907, the\r\nwriter, while working for the University of Chicago, in exploring the\r\nsame locality, exhausted the beds so far as they could at that time be\r\nuncovered from the landslide which had overwhelmed them. The formation\r\nin which the bones occur is a soft gray or reddish shale, and it lies\r\nwithout any apparent stratigraphic break on shales of Pennsylvanian age.\r\nBelow these shales are several feet of limestone containing invertebrates\r\nof typical Pennsylvanian facies. There are indications of at least 3\r\nspecies of Amphibia in the deposits. Case (86) has indicated with doubt a\r\nfourth species. The species are: _Cricotus heteroclitus_ Cope, _Cricotus\r\ngibsonii_ Cope, _Diplocaulus salamandroides_ Cope. The remains are very\r\nfragmentary, and consist for the most part of incomplete vertebræ, with a\r\nfew small skull fragments.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In 1897 Dr. Williston (607) described some fragments of _Cricotus_\r\nfrom a deposit in Cowley County, near Winfield, Kansas. There has been\r\nsome dispute as to the age of the deposit, but the consensus of opinion\r\nseems to be that the beds are of approximately the same age as those of\r\nIllinois and Pennsylvania in which similar remains are found, and those\r\ndeposits are looked upon as Upper Pennsylvania (Case (94), pp. 239-240).\r\nNo new forms were described from Winfield, since only a few fragments were\r\nobtained. Williston referred the phalange, the fragment of a jaw, and the\r\ntooth to _Cricotus heteroclitus_ Cope.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Later in the same year Williston (608) announced the discovery of\r\na tooth of typical labyrinthodont structure from near Louisville, Kansas\r\n(plate 21, fig. 6). The tooth was accompanied by fragments of bone and was\r\nprobably not far from the bed in which it was fossilized. Williston states\r\nthat the remains were from the shales which are \"nearly at the upper part\r\nof the Carboniferous, probably within one hundred feet of the Manhattan\r\nLimestone.\"\r\n\r\n(_d_) In 1894 Marsh (406) and earlier (1873) Mudge (490) described\r\nfootprints of vertebrates from the stone-quarries near Osage City, Kansas.\r\nThe stone in which they were found was a fine-grained limestone which\r\noccurs near the middle of the Kansas Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Two years later Marsh (407) announced the discovery of traces of\r\nthe oldest known (Devonian) air-breathing vertebrate. The footprints of\r\n_Thinopus antiquus_ were regarded by Marsh as \"apparently amphibian.\" This\r\nstill remains the oldest geological evidence of air-breathing vertebrates,\r\nalthough Lohest some years ago (381) called attention to remains from the\r\nDevonian of France which he thought might be amphibian. The footprint\r\ndescribed by Professor Marsh was \"found in the town of Pleasant, one\r\nmile south of the Allegheny River, Warren County, Pennsylvania, by Dr.\r\nCharles E. Beecher, who presented it to Yale Museum, and also furnished\r\nthe information in regard to its geological position.... The geological\r\nhorizon is near the top of the Chemung, in the upper Devonian. In the\r\nsame beds are ripple marks, mud cracks, and impressions of rain drops,\r\nindicating shallow water and shore deposits.\"\r\n\r\n(_f_) Among the collections of the American Museum there is an impression\r\nof a small amphibian foot obtained from Phoenix Tunnel, Pennsylvania.\r\nThe impression is in hard black slate very similar to the slate of the\r\nCannelton region. It is possible that the specimen may have been obtained\r\nfrom the Cannelton beds, since they would be expected to occur at Phoenix\r\nTunnel. The impression is rather small. It is the footprint of a 5-toed\r\nanimal, probably of the right foot, since no amphibian (465) so far is\r\nknown from the Coal Measures with 5 digits on the hand. The first digit\r\nis short and thick, with a large ball at its base. The foot measures from\r\nthe posterior edge of the palm to the tip of the longest digit 12 mm. The\r\nlength of the first digit is 7 mm. The impression differs in some respects\r\nfrom the impressions so far known from the Coal Measures, but no attempt\r\nwill be made to assign it to a species. It may have been made by either\r\na branchiosaurian or a microsaurian, but more probably the latter, since\r\nwe do not know of any of the former animals from the Cannelton beds, or in\r\nfact from any of the Coal Measures beds excepting the Mazon Creek shales.\r\nThe specimen is No. 2872 of the American Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.

Udden, in 1907, discovered a fragment of a phalanx of some\r\namphibian (plate 22, fig. 3) on the dump of the Cooperative Coal Company,\r\na mile east of Breeze, Illinois. It was obtained from below the Shoal\r\nCreek limestone and somewhere above the (Illinois) Coal No. 6, according\r\nto Dr. Udden's notes. The maximum width of the phalanx is 10 mm. and it\r\nprobably had a length of 16 mm.\r\n\r\n(_h_) Mr. N. H. Brown, in 1914, discovered in the Carboniferous rocks\r\nto the east of the Wind River Mountains, near Lander, Wyoming, a single\r\nfragment of an amphibian. The writer was accompanying Mr. Brown at the\r\ntime of the discovery and there can be no doubt that the fragment was\r\namphibian; the location of the beds was such that no later age than the\r\nCoal Measures can be assigned to them.\r\n\r\n(_i_) Dr. J. A. Udden (577), in 1912, announced the discovery of an\r\namphibian in the Des Moines formation of Iowa. These remains were\r\nidentified by Dr. Charles Eastman as _Pleuroptyx clavatus_ Cope. Since the\r\nDes Moines is probably nearly contemporaneous with the Mazon Creek shales\r\nof Illinois, the discovery does not extend the geological range to any\r\nextent, but is of interest as it adds another note to our knowledge of the\r\ngeographical distribution of the Amphibia in the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n(_j_) The Gurley collection of the University of Chicago possesses a\r\nsingle cervical vertebra of some amphibian (?). The vertebra is unlike\r\nanything previously described and represents a new form (plate 22, fig. 2)\r\nwhich may be designated _Proterpeton gurleyi_, new genus and species. The\r\nmaterial was collected near Danville, Illinois.\r\n\r\n(_k_) Deposits have been discovered in Pennsylvania in which are found the\r\nremains of amphibians and reptiles, very similar to those from Vermilion\r\nCounty, Illinois, Cowley County, Kansas, and the Texas Permian. The\r\nremains (plate 18, fig. 2) were found in a thin stratum below the \"Ames\"\r\nlimestone, and are therefore in the Coal Measures, fairly well below the\r\ntop. The fossils, as described by Case (94), consist of fragments which\r\nhe ascribes to pelycosaurian reptiles and to temnospondylous amphibians.\r\nThe genus _Eryops_ (94) is recognized in several fragments and a nearly\r\ncomplete dorsal vertebral centrum. Other types of Amphibia are likewise\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n(_l_) The ironstone nodules, in which the Mazon Creek fossils (plate 1)\r\noccur, are found in the shale which forms the roof of the Morris or \"No.\r\n2\" Coal of Illinois, which \"lies probably somewhat lower than the horizon\r\nof the Lower Kittanning Coal of Pennsylvania\" (599). \"The nodules of iron\r\ncontained in the Coal shales on the banks of Mazon Creek near Morris,\r\nIllinois, generally contain organic nuclei, and thousands of beautiful\r\nspecimens have been obtained there. They are usually fragments of fern\r\nfronds, but are sometimes shells, crustaceans, myriapods, scorpions,\r\nspiders, cockroaches, ... fishes\" (498, p. 214), and amphibians, of which\r\n10 species are at present known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                            PLATE 1\r\n\r\nVIEWS ALONG MAZON CREEK, ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\n  1.

These animals are\r\nthe oldest known land vertebrates of North America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Portion of the \"Morris sheet\" of the U. S.\r\nGeological Survey, to show topography and situations of the exposures\r\nof fossil-bearing shales at Mazon River, _a_, the \"Bartlett place,\" the\r\nso-called \"upper beds\"; _b_, \"lower beds.\"]\r\n\r\nThe writer was able, during July 1911, to spend a week studying the\r\nfossil beds (479) at Mazon Creek. The object of the visit was primarily\r\nto collect Amphibia, but although several thousand nodules were examined,\r\nnot one contained an amphibian nor a fragment of one. Mr. J. C. Carr,\r\nof Morris, Illinois, who has collected at Mazon Creek for more than 30\r\nyears, has never collected an amphibian. These facts interested me in\r\nmaking the following comparison: If we take 100,000 nodules as a basis\r\nfor computation of the rarity of the various forms, something like the\r\nfollowing will be the approximate result of the investigation:\r\n\r\nOf 100,000 nodules, 20,000 will be barren or contain only indeterminate\r\nfragments; 68,500 will contain plants; 7,500 will contain insects,\r\nCrustacea, myriapods, scorpions, spiders, and other arthropods; 3,900 will\r\ncontain fish coprolites or scales; 95 may contain fish or fragments of\r\nfish; 4 may contain mollusks; and 1 may contain an amphibian or a fragment\r\nof one.\r\n\r\nPerhaps even 100,000 is low as a basis of estimate. Mr. Carr was of the\r\nopinion that 1 nodule in every 500,000 might contain an amphibian.\r\n\r\nThe beds from which the nodules are usually collected occur along both\r\nbanks and in the bottom of the creek, in two localities. One locality\r\nknown as the Bartlett place is situated 8 miles southeast of Morris, in\r\nGrundy County, Illinois, Wauponsee Township, N.W. quarter, section 30,\r\nTownship 33, Range 8, the land being now owned by Mrs. Emma Akerly, of\r\nWilmington, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe fossil-bearing nodules occur throughout 6 to 8 feet of shale along\r\nboth banks of the creek at the \"upper beds\" (plate 1, fig. 3), as the\r\nBartlett place is called. They may also be seen in the bed of the creek,\r\nwhen the water is low (plate 1, fig. 4), still embedded in the shale. With\r\na potato fork the shale is easily turned and the nodules come out like\r\npotatoes. One sometimes finds a \"pocket\" of nodules from which as many\r\nas a peck may be secured. Nearly every nodule has a fossil at the \"upper\r\nbeds,\" but all of the fossils are not well preserved, possibly only 1 or\r\n2 out of every 10 being worth carrying to the museum. The nodules crack\r\nbest when wet, and it requires some skill to crack them evenly. They seem\r\nquite light and, in one place where the stream curves, are piled in a long\r\nwindrow. On this were found, in nodules cracked by the frost, several good\r\ncrustaceans and many good plants.\r\n\r\nTable of Pennsylvanic Formations.\r\n\r\n  Series   Northern Appalachian.

(After Schuchert.)\r\n\r\nThe fossils at the \"upper beds\" are localized into special strata. At one\r\nplace in the upper part of the deposit, in a reddish shale, one finds\r\nthat insects are more abundant than they are lower down. The Crustacea\r\nseem to come from apparently the same shale. At the lower end of the\r\ndeposit certain definite species of _Pecopteris_ are localized. It is\r\nan interesting fact that one seldom finds a _Neuropteris_ at the \"upper\r\nbeds.\" The most abundant fossils are the various species of _Pecopteris_\r\nand _Annularia_. When specimens of _Neuropteris_ are found they are\r\nusually discovered at the lower end of the exposures. In one place behind\r\nthe \"island\" very blue nodules, hard and flinty and with sometimes\r\nwell-preserved specimens of _Pecopteris_, are found quite definitely\r\nlocalized. These nodules are apt to assume an irregular shape. These\r\nlocalizations of the fossils are, of course, what we would expect from our\r\nknowledge of the recent fauna and flora. There is, to be sure, more or\r\nless intermingling of the species. The myriapods, so far as they have been\r\nfound, are also localized. Mr. Carr found 3 within a space of a few feet,\r\nbut again these are found widely scattered. The exposures at the \"upper\r\nbeds\" are about a quarter of a mile long. They disappear under a heavy\r\nledge of sandy limestone.\r\n\r\nAt the \"lower beds\" (plate 1, fig. 6), those further down the creek,\r\nconditions are quite different from those just described, although of the\r\nsame horizon: the banks of the creek are higher and almost perpendicular,\r\nso that the chances of collection from the shales are fewer. The bed of\r\nthe creek, however, is wider and there are more nodules washed out. The\r\nmost abundant fossil at this place is _Neuropteris_. The nodules at the\r\nupper end of the exposure are all, almost without exception, barren of\r\nfossils. The exposures here are of about the same extent as the \"upper\r\nbeds,\" though the species are not so varied. Judging from the collections\r\nmade while there, Arthropoda are more abundant at the \"lower beds.\"\r\n\r\nBradley (Geol. Surv. Illinois, IV, 196, 1870) mentions the occurrence\r\nof these nodules at or near Morris. Other than these places the nodules\r\nhave been thrown out of a coal mine near Braidwood, Illinois. Doubtless\r\nclose search would reveal other localities where the shale is cut through\r\nin mining. The beds at both places are slightly folded. This is true\r\nespecially of the \"upper beds,\" where a conspicuous fold caused the beds\r\nto disappear in the bed of the creek and to reappear farther down stream.\r\nThis is directly across the large \"ox-bow\" bend of the creek.\r\n\r\nThe beds at Mazon Creek were first explored in 1857 by Mr. Joseph Evans,\r\nwho sent his specimens to Berlin, Germany, where they excited great\r\ninterest. It was he who collected the type specimen of _Amphibamus\r\ngrandiceps_ Cope. Since the time of Mr. Evans many have collected at Mazon\r\nCreek, and without doubt the fossil-bearing nodules from this locality are\r\nmore widely scattered in the museums of the world than are organic remains\r\nfrom any other one horizon.\r\n\r\nSo far as we know there was no upland vertebrate life at that time. The\r\nforms at present known were confined to the water or the margins of the\r\nwater. The absence of knowledge of upland and terrestrial deposits of\r\nthis time doubtless accounts for the absence of known vertebrates. It is,\r\nhowever, especially interesting to speculate on the ancestral types of the\r\nland vertebrates, and it must be admitted that the Coal Measures Amphibia\r\nas at present known throw the ancestry of land-living vertebrates far back\r\ninto geological time.\r\n\r\n(_m_) The Cannelton slates of Beaver County, Pennsylvania, have furnished\r\n3 species of Amphibia and fragments of other species are represented in\r\nthe U. S. National Museum (462). The species so far known are: _Tuditanus\r\nminimus_ Moodie, _Erpetosaurus sculptilis_ Moodie, _Erpetosaurus minutus_\r\nMoodie.\r\n\r\nThey are the first evidence of the occurrence of amphibian remains in\r\nthese deposits. The Cannelton specimens are found in a thin stratum of\r\nslate which forms part of the Middle Cannelton Coal. The Cannelton slate,\r\nin which the fossils occur, forms the roof of the Middle Kittanning Coal,\r\nwhich is only 20 to 30 feet above the Lower Kittanning bed (I. C. White),\r\nso it becomes evident that the deposition of the Cannelton slates was at\r\nonly a slightly later period than that of the shales in which the Mazon\r\nCreek nodules occur, since the Mazon Creek shales form the roof of the\r\nMorris, which \"is probably somewhat lower than the Lower Kittanning of\r\nPennsylvania.\" From the Cannelton slates are known the remains of plants,\r\ninsects, crustacea, especially \"Eurypterids found in shale immediately\r\nbelow the Darlington (Upper Kittanning) Cannel Coal, near Cannelton,\r\nDarlington Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, Horizon, Allegheny River\r\nSeries\" (Hall, 1884). In these shales occur also, fishes and the 3 species\r\nof amphibians referred to above. The Amphibia known from this region are\r\nsmall, the largest of them not exceeding 6 inches in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Portion of \"West Virginia-Ohio-Pennsylvania,\r\nWellsville Quadrangle\" of the U.S. Geological Survey, to show topography\r\nand situation of Linton coal mines. Some fossil amphibians doubtless came\r\nfrom across the line in Columbiana County.]\r\n\r\n(_n_) The Linton, Ohio, beds outcropped near Linton post-office, which\r\nwas formerly located at the mouth of Yellow Creek, a few hundred yards\r\nfrom the present station, Yellow Creek, Salem Township, Jefferson County,\r\nin the valley of Yellow Creek, near the Ohio River, and thus near the\r\nPennsylvania state line.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the exact location of the town of Linton, which has long\r\nsince been abandoned, I quote from a letter from Dr. Louis Hussakof, who\r\nvisited the locality:\r\n\r\n  \"The locality appears to have been known as Yellow Creek for many\r\n  years past. That is the name used in the Geological Map of Ohio\r\n  published by Orton in 1888 and which was based on the earlier maps\r\n  of Newberry (1869 and 1879). When I visited the place in 1905, and\r\n  asked for Linton (which I had not been able to locate on any map then\r\n  available to me), hardly anyone knew of such a locality. Only one old\r\n  man in Steubenville, Ohio, recalled that Yellow Creek was identical\r\n  with Linton.\r\n\r\n  \"Yellow Creek is not a village, but only a R. R. station (on the\r\n  Pennsylvania R. R.), and marks a spot where once was an active\r\n  and prosperous mine. Probably at a former day there was a small\r\n  post-office somewhere in the neighborhood known as Linton. I did not\r\n  take any photographs, as I was not certain of the spot, or the mine,\r\n  from which the fossils had come. There are some cement mines within a\r\n  few minutes' walk of the station, but no coal appears to be mined at\r\n  present at Yellow Creek. 'Smith's Pit,' the coal mine best remembered\r\n  by the younger men, is not worked.\r\n\r\n  \"Now as to the question whether some of the Amphibia might have come\r\n  from localities in Columbiana County. I believe it very probable that\r\n  they did. I walked along the road from Yellow Creek (Jefferson County)\r\n  to Wellsville (Columbiana County), a distance of about 2 or 2.5 miles,\r\n  and the country seemed quite the same. Everywhere one sees outcrops\r\n  of coal in the cuts along the road. Furthermore, I inclose a copy of\r\n  a page in an old notebook of Professor Newberry from which you will\r\n  see that Coal Measure fossil localities were known not only at Yellow\r\n  Creek, but also from near Wellsville. There can be hardly a doubt that\r\n  most of the specimens you have are from Yellow Creek; and quite a\r\n  number are those collected by Sam Huston.\"\r\n\r\nNewberry says, in regard to the fauna of the Linton Coal:\r\n\r\n  \"The Linton locality is especially interesting and instructive. It\r\n  has already (1889) yielded more than 20 species of fishes and nearly\r\n  40 species of aquatic amphibians, all inhabitants of the same body\r\n  of water. These were found in a thin stratum of cannel which, over\r\n  a limited area, underlies a thick bed of cubical coal (No. 6 of the\r\n  Ohio reports), of which the place is near the top of the Lower Coal\r\n  Measures. At Linton, ... we have evidence that the great marsh in\r\n  which the peat accumulated that formed coal No. 6 was for a time a\r\n  lake or a lagoon, inhabited by the fishes and amphibians to which I\r\n  have referred.... Many of the fishes and the amphibians were highly\r\n  carnivorous and powerful, as we learn from their teeth and coprolites.\r\n  The largest of the amphibians must have been 8 or 10 feet in length,\r\n  having strong jaws, set with numerous lancet-shaped teeth an inch\r\n  or more in length.... After a sufficient time had elapsed for many\r\n  generations of fishes and aquatic salamanders to live and die, the\r\n  lake was filled by the extension of its peaty shores into it just as\r\n  so many lakelets are filled and obliterated at the present time and\r\n  afterward over the cannel was formed a mass of peat, which has now\r\n  become a stratum of cubical coal 7 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n  \"In the Linton cannel are buried fragments or entire individuals of\r\n  all the inhabitants of this body of water which had hard parts, bones,\r\n  scales, spines, or teeth, capable of preservation. Hence we get a\r\n  locally complete picture of the life of the Carboniferous age, and we\r\n  find it to be unexpectedly rich and varied. In that age fishes and\r\n  amphibians were the highest forms of animal life, and the amphibians\r\n  were comparatively newcomers on the earth's surface. Yet they had\r\n  multiplied and differentiated until this little pool contained\r\n  millions of them, varying in length from 6 inches to 10 feet and\r\n  curiously diversified in their forms, their scales, and spines, and in\r\n  the ornamentation of their enamel-covered heads\" (498).\r\n\r\n  \"To the paleontologist there are few places in the world more\r\n  interesting than the Diamond mine, at Linton, since here we get such\r\n  a view of the life of the Carboniferous age as is afforded almost\r\n  nowhere else, and of the great numbers of species found there, not\r\n  more than three or four have been met with elsewhere\" (497).\r\n\r\nOn page 18 is a list of the Amphibia which are thus far described from the\r\nLinton deposits. They all belong, so far as known, to the Microsauria, the\r\nreference of any of the species to other orders being doubtful. The larger\r\nAmphibia seem to be indicated by a large rib which resembles very much\r\nthat described by Huxley in 1863 for _Anthracosaurus_.\r\n\r\nAmphibia from the Linton Beds (51 SPECIES).\r\n\r\n  _Brachydectes newberryi_ Cope.

Skull and portions of body.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-listed species there are others indicated by fragments\r\ntoo poorly preserved to be worthy of specific designation. The Linton\r\nAmphibia are all apparently confined exclusively to that locality. Species\r\nfrom the Cannelton slates have been assigned, however, to genera which\r\noccur at Linton, _i.e._, _Erpetosaurus_ and _Tuditanus_. This reference\r\nmay be due to lack of knowledge, as the forms are insufficiently known. A\r\nsingle Linton species has been assigned to _Ichthyerpeton_, a genus known\r\notherwise only from the Coal Measures of Kilkenny, Ireland. Cope referred\r\nspecies from Linton to the genus _Ceraterpeton_ of Huxley, from Kilkenny,\r\nIreland, but Jaekel (347) and the writer (462) have shown that the\r\nspecies were incorrectly assigned to the genus _Ceraterpeton_, and that\r\nin fact they represent widely distinct genera. A single species has been\r\nidentified by Eastman from the Des Moines limestone of Iowa as identical\r\nwith one from Linton, _Pleuroptyx clavatus_ Cope. The Linton fauna is\r\ndistinct from that of the Mazon Creek beds, and also from that of South\r\nJoggins, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n(_o_) The deposits in Nova Scotia have been correlated with the Coal\r\nMeasures strata of the United States (Bell, Summ. Rpt. Geol. Surv. Canada,\r\n1912, 1914, 360-371). They are very near the same age as the Linton beds\r\nand come in near the base of the Allegheny River series. The exposures\r\nare at the South Joggins, along the sea-coast. Here in strata of clay\r\ninterstratified with coal are found the erect stumps of the Sigillariæ,\r\nand it was in the rock within these stumps that Lyell and Dawson, in 1853,\r\ndiscovered the remains of the amphibians which they termed \"reptiles.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The bones of Dendrerpeton hitherto found, as well as those of the\r\n  smaller species, have been obtained from the interior of erect\r\n  Sigillariæ, and all of those in one of the many beds which, at the\r\n  Joggins, contain such remains. The thick cellular inner bark of the\r\n  Sigillaria was very perishable; the slender woody axis was somewhat\r\n  more durable; but near the surface of the stem, there was a layer of\r\n  elongated cells, or bast tissue of considerable durability, and the\r\n  outer bark was exceedingly dense and indestructible. Hence an erect\r\n  tree, partly imbedded in sediment, and subjected to the influence of\r\n  the weather, became a hollow shell of bark. When they remained open\r\n  for a considerable time, they would constitute pitfalls into which\r\n  animals walking on the surface might be precipitated. When the surface\r\n  was inundated all such remains would be covered and imbedded in the\r\n  sediment. These seem to have been the precise conditions of the bed\r\n  which afforded these remains.\" (Dawson, 223, 1894.)\r\n\r\nFifteen species have been described from the Joggins deposits. Two are\r\nknown from the Albion mines, south Nova Scotia, where were obtained the\r\nremains of _Baphetes planiceps_ Owen and _B. minor_ Dawson.\r\n\r\nThe following 17 species of Amphibia are known from the Carboniferous of\r\nCanada:\r\n\r\n  _Amblyodon problematicum_ Dawson. Teeth and fragments.\r\n  _Baphetes minor_ Dawson. An incomplete mandible.\r\n  _Baphetes planiceps_ Owen. An incomplete cranium from Albion.\r\n  _Dendrerpeton acadianum_ Owen.

William Dawson at the South Joggins and at the mines of Albion,\r\nwith the exception of _Eosaurus_, which was collected by O. C. Marsh.\r\nThe collections of Dawson are now in the Peter Redpath Museum of McGill\r\nUniversity in Montreal and in the British Museum of Natural History at\r\nSouth Kensington, London. The history of the discovery of the deposits and\r\ntheir amphibian fossils at the South Joggins is so interesting that it\r\nwas thought worth while to reproduce in large part Dawson's paper \"On the\r\nMode of Occurrence of Remains of Land Animals in Erect Trees at the South\r\nJoggins, Nova Scotia,\" published in 1891 in the Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety of Canada, section IV, p. 127:\r\n\r\n  \"The remarkable section of coal-formation rocks at the South Joggins,\r\n  in Cumberland County, has long been known as one of the most\r\n  instructive in the world; exhibiting as it does a thickness of 5,000\r\n  feet of strata of coal-formation in a cliff of considerable height,\r\n  kept clean by the tides and waves, and in the reefs extending from\r\n  this to the shore, which at low tide expose the beds very perfectly.\r\n  It was first described in detail by the late Sir W. E. Logan (Report\r\n  Geol. Surv. Canada, 1844), and afterwards the middle portion of it\r\n  was still more detailed by the author (Dawson), more especially in\r\n  connection with the fossil remains characteristic of the several beds\r\n  and the vegetable constituents and accompaniments of the numerous\r\n  seams of coal (Jour. Geol. Soc. Lond., X, p. 1, 1853). It was on\r\n  occasion of a visit of the author in company with Sir Charles Lyell,\r\n  and in the pursuit of these investigations, that one of the most\r\n  remarkable features of the section was disclosed in 1851. This is\r\n  the occurrence, in the trunks of certain trees imbedded in an erect\r\n  position in the sandstones of Coal-mine Point, of remains of small\r\n  reptiles, which with one exception, a specimen from the Pictou\r\n  coal-fields, were the first ever discovered in the Carboniferous rocks\r\n  of the American continent, and are still (1891) the most perfect\r\n  examples known of a most interesting family of coal-formation animals,\r\n  intermediate in some respects between reptiles proper and batrachians,\r\n  and known as Microsauria. With these were found the first-known\r\n  Carboniferous land snails and millipedes. Very complete collections of\r\n  these remains have been placed by the author with his other specimens\r\n  in the Peter Redpath Museum and in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n  \"A forest or grove of the large ribbed trees known as _Sigillariæ_ was\r\n  either submerged by subsidence or, growing on low ground, was invaded\r\n  with the muddy waters of an inundation, or successive inundations,\r\n  so that the trunks were buried to the depth of several feet. The\r\n  projecting tops having been removed by subaerial decay, the buried\r\n  stumps became hollow, while their hard outer bark remained intact.\r\n  They thus became hollow cylinders in a vertical position and open\r\n  at the top. The surface having then become dry land, covered with\r\n  vegetation, was haunted by small quadrupeds and other land animals,\r\n  which from time to time fell into the open holes, in some cases nine\r\n  feet deep, and could not extricate themselves. On their death, and\r\n  the decomposition of their soft parts, their bones and other hard\r\n  portions remained in the bottom of the tree intermixed with any\r\n  vegetable debris or soil washed in by rain, and which formed thin\r\n  layers separating successive animal deposits from each other. Finally,\r\n  the area was again submerged or overflowed by water, bearing sand\r\n  and mud. The hollow trees were filled to the top and their animal\r\n  contents thus sealed up. At length the material filling the trees was\r\n  by pressure and the access of cementing matter hardened to stone, not\r\n  infrequently harder than that of the contained beds, and the whole\r\n  being tilted to an angle of 20°, and elevated into land exposed to\r\n  the action of the tide and waves, these singular coffins present\r\n  themselves as stony cylinders projecting from the cliff or reef, and\r\n  can be extracted and their contents studied. The singular combination\r\n  of accidents above detailed was, of course, of very rare occurrence,\r\n  and, in point of fact, we know only one set of beds at the South\r\n  Joggins in which such remains so preserved occur; nor is there, so\r\n  far as I am aware, any other known instance elsewhere. Even in the\r\n  beds in question, only a portion of the trees, about 15 out of 30,\r\n  have afforded animal remains. We have, however, thus been enabled to\r\n  obtain specimens of a number of species which would probably otherwise\r\n  have been unknown, being less likely than others to be preserved in\r\n  properly aqueous deposits. Such discoveries on the one hand impress\r\n  us with the imperfection of the geological record; on the other, they\r\n  show us the singular provisions which have been made in the course of\r\n  geological time for preserving the relics of the ancient world, and\r\n  which await the industry and skill of collectors to disclose their\r\n  hidden treasures.\r\n\r\n  \"There is evidence in coprolitic matter on one of the surfaces within\r\n  the trunks, and also in certain trails on these surfaces, that some of\r\n  the imprisoned animals lived for a time in their subterranean prisons;\r\n  that they crept around their walls in search of a way of escape, and\r\n  that the larger animals fed on smaller species entrapped along with\r\n  them.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of these entombed amphibians Sir William Dawson was\r\ngiven a grant of £50 from the Government Fund by the council of the\r\nRoyal Society of London, to aid in the extraction of these trees and the\r\ncollection of their contents. The trees were carefully taken out and\r\ntheir contents examined; the portions containing the animal remains were\r\ncarefully boxed to be taken to Montreal for final cleaning and study.\r\nErosion goes on rapidly at the South Joggins, but no one has paid any\r\nattention to the occurrence of Amphibia along the coast of Nova Scotia\r\nwithin recent years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Dawson's tree No. 13 at the South Joggins, Nova\r\nScotia. Upper part, _in situ_, in the reef after it had been exposed by\r\nblasting. (After Dawson, based on a photograph.)]\r\n\r\n(_q_) A deposit which will be of undoubted interest in connection with\r\nthe occurrence of Amphibia in the Coal Measures is that which outcrops\r\nalong the banks of Rock Creek in the South western part of Douglas County,\r\nKansas, in Marion Township (Township 14 south, Range 18 east, SW. and SE.\r\nquarters of section 7), about 2 miles from the now-abandoned post-office\r\nof Twin Mounds, so called from the two flat-topped, elongated mounds of\r\nOread limestone to the west of the town.\r\n\r\nThe interest in these beds is not due to the discovery of Amphibia in\r\nthem, but the possibilities of such discoveries. This is indicated by the\r\noccurrence of fossils, in nodules similar to those obtained from Mazon\r\nCreek, which are identical generically, nd in most cases specifically,\r\nwith the Mazon Creek animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThe fossils so far collected from this interesting locality are:\r\n\r\nInsecta (Identified by Dr. E. H. Sellards).\r\n    _Spiloblattina maledicta_ (Scudder). The basal half of a front wing.\r\n    _Etoblattina_ sp. The hind wing of a cockroach.\r\n\r\nArachnida.\r\n    _Anthrocomartus_. Impression of the body.\r\n    _Prestwichia danæ_ M. & W. Nearly complete specimen.\r\n\r\nCrustacea.\r\n    _Acanthotelson stimpsoni_ M. & W. Three nearly complete individuals.\r\n\r\nPlants (Identified by Mr. J. C. Carr, of Morris, Ill.).\r\n    _Pecopteris_ sp.\r\n    _Sagittaria reticulata_ Lesquereux.\r\n    _Annularia longifolia_ Lesquereux.\r\n    _Annularia inflata_ Lesquereux.\r\n    _Pecopteris villosa_ Brongniart.\r\n    _Neuropteris decipiens_ Lesquereux.\r\n    _Pecopteris serpulifolia_ Lesquereux. By far the most abundant plant\r\n      is _Pecopteris_.\r\n\r\nThe fossils occur in definite strata of nodules immediately above a\r\n10-inch coal seam which is worked for local consumption. The coal lies\r\nnear the base of the exposure in the more western portion of the outcrop,\r\nbut it is raised by an anticlinal fold to near the top of the creek-banks\r\nby the bridge across Rock Creek, along the banks of which the shales are\r\nexposed. Nodules containing fossils are found most abundantly at the\r\nwestern exposure on the McKinzie place, only a few having been found near\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nBelow the coal-seam, nodules of various shapes and sizes occur, but they\r\nseldom contain fossils and never good ones. Occasionally, as at Mazon\r\nCreek, fragments of plants adhere to the outside of the incrusting shale.\r\nA single nodule may have adhering to it fragments of 4 genera of plants.\r\nThe fossiliferous nodules all occur above the coal and are most prolific\r\nand abundant immediately above the seam, within the first 10 inches. In\r\nthe same stratum of shale with the nodules are found abundant impressions\r\nof plants in the shale, often perfect fronds being uncovered. (See, in\r\nthis connection, Twenhofel and Dunbar, 1914, \"Nodules with Fishes from the\r\nCoal Measures of Kansas,\" Amer. Journ. Sci., XXXVIII, pp. 157-163.)\r\n\r\nG. F. Matthew (408-413) has described numerous genera and species of\r\nfootprints, presumably amphibian, from the Carboniferous of Canada. The\r\nimpressions indicate small creatures for the most part. Other imprints\r\nhave been described by Logan, Dawson, Lyell, Marsh, Mudge, and Lea. Since\r\nthe present work is intended largely for a morphological review, only\r\npassing notice can be given to the _ichnites_. The literature on the\r\n\"Ichnites\" has been brought together in Hay's \"Bibliography and Catalogue\r\nof Fossil Vertebrata of North America,\" pp. 538-553. References since the\r\npublication of Hay's catalogue (317) will be found in the bibliography at\r\nthe end of this work. Footprints are of interest in that they are the only\r\nevidence we have of the occurrence of land vertebrates in the Devonian and\r\nMississippian of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MORPHOLOGY OF THE COAL MEASURES AMPHIBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of the Coal Measures Amphibia presents many primitive types\r\nof structure. Their organization represents a stage passed through\r\nin the ontogeny of higher vertebrates. The animals are similar in a\r\ngeneral way, yet so diverse are the modifications which they have\r\nsuffered under different environmental conditions, that close scrutiny\r\nis needed to discern the exact relationship of the forms. Our knowledge\r\nof this relationship is based on the structures preserved, which are\r\nlargely skeletal, since little is known of the soft anatomy (471) of the\r\nair-breathing vertebrates of the Coal Measures. The pubis is ossified in\r\nthe Paleozoic Amphibia later than the ischium and ilium; the carpus and\r\ntarsus are cartilaginous; the vertebræ consist of a pleurocentrum and two\r\nneurocentra, thus paralleling conditions in modern mammalian embryos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Generalized figure of dorsum of an early amphibian\r\nskull to show position of elements and terminology adopted in this work.\r\nThe outline is based on that of _Eryops_, but is in no way intended to\r\nindicate that form.\r\n\r\n_a. com_, anterior commissure of lateral-line canals; _com_, commissural\r\ncommunication between infra- and supra-orbital lateral-line canals; _fr_,\r\nfrontal; _inf_, interfrontal; _inn_, internasal; _info_, infraorbital\r\nlateral-line canal; _it_, intertemporal; _jl_, jugal lateral-line canal;\r\n_j_, jugal; _lar_, lacrimal; _mx_, maxilla; _n_, nasal; _oc_, occiput;\r\n_occ_, occipital cross-commissure of the lateral-line system; _or_,\r\norbit; _par_, parietal; _pof_, postfrontal; _pmx_, premaxilla; _pf_,\r\nprefrontal; _po_, postorbital; _pp_, postparietal; _g_, quadrate; _qj_,\r\nquadratojugal; _spo_, supraorbital lateral-line canal; _sq_, squamosal;\r\n_spt_, supratemporal; _t_, temporal lateral-line canal; _tab_, tabulare.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) The skull of the Coal Measures Amphibia has (fig. 6) essentially\r\nthe same structure in the different groups. It is largely formed of\r\nbones of intramembranous origin, representing the _face_ bones of the\r\nmammalian skull. The skull in life was doubtless a _chondrocranium_ with\r\nthe membrane bones laid down upon the cartilaginous box containing the\r\nsense-organs, as in the sturgeon (_Acipenser_), where the surface bones of\r\nthe face were probably originally scales, which later became consolidated\r\ninto large bony scutes. The membrane bones of the early Amphibia may have\r\nbeen originally derived from scales, but at present nothing is known of\r\nthis origin; doubtless the elements had an intramembranous origin in the\r\nancestors of the group. Judging from Credner's studies on the series\r\nof specimens of _Branchiosaurus amblystomus_ Credner (187), the skull\r\nbones do not ossify completely until relatively late in the life of the\r\nindividual. The skull in the youngest individual figured by Credner\r\n(_op. cit._, Taf. XVI, fig. 1) seems to be largely cartilaginous, with\r\nbeginnings of separation into the skeletal elements. The manner and\r\ntime of development and ossification of the skull seems to proceed much\r\nas it does in modern amphibians. The condition found in the skull of\r\n_Cryptobranchus allegheniensis_ or _Necturus maculosus_ will represent\r\npretty accurately the condition of most of the Coal Measures Amphibia. The\r\nface bones in certain forms were sculptured and cut by lateral-line canals.\r\n\r\nA median suture divides the skull into two equal regions dorsally. On\r\nthe sides of this median suture lie pairs of elements which are common\r\nto all higher vertebrates. These elements are: the premaxillæ, nasals,\r\nfrontals, parietals, and post-parietals. All of these elements vary\r\nsomewhat in shape and slightly in arrangement, but always occupy the same\r\nrelative positions. To the side of these elements lie the prefrontal, the\r\npostfrontal, the supratemporal, the squamosal, and tabulare, and occupying\r\nthe margin of the skull are the maxilla, the jugal, the quadratojugal, and\r\npossibly the quadrate in a few forms. The parietal foramen occurs usually\r\nwithin the parietal bone, but its position is subject to slight variations\r\nand it may occur on the suture between the frontal and the parietal, or\r\neven far posterior near the postparietal. The nostrils often lie well\r\nforward and are included by the premaxillæ, nasals, and prefrontals. The\r\norbit is usually well posterior, but it may occur far forward. It is\r\nbounded by the prefrontal, the frontal, the postfrontal, the post-orbital,\r\nand the jugal. Sometimes the lacrimal is present and has been clearly\r\nidentified on the anterior margin of the orbit in a few cases.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Sclerotic plates_ often occur within the orbits, and are not\r\nconfined to any particular group, though they are quite constant among\r\nthe Branchiosauria. They are usually delicate, thin, broad plates which\r\nevidently overlap and operate as in modern animals. The number varies, as\r\nmany as 30 occurring within the orbit of one branchiosaur. Between the\r\nmargin of the orbit and the sclerotic plates there often occur, in the\r\nBranchiosauria (186) particularly, small scale-like particles which were\r\ndoubtless embedded in the heavy skin above the orbit during life.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _palate_ of the skull is very incompletely known, being\r\nindicated in a very few cases. These specimens, however, show that\r\nthe characters of the palate were quite similar, if not identical, in\r\nessential respects with the palate among the European species of the same\r\nor slightly later time.\r\n\r\nA large cultriform parasphenoid occupies the posterior portion of the\r\npalate, on either side of which in some species lies the posterior\r\npalatine foramen. On the sides of the anterior prolongation of the\r\nparasphenoid lie the vomers (186), membranous bones often bearing minute\r\ntubercular teeth, apparently adapted for crushing. The vomers and the\r\nmaxillæ, with sometimes the palatine, surround the anterior palatine\r\nforamen, which is almost always present; sometimes, however, quite small.\r\nThe transverse or ectopterygoid unites the pterygoid, a broad plate of\r\nthin bone, with the maxilla and jugal.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The teeth of the Coal Measures Amphibia (194) are remarkably similar\r\nin the various forms. They are always slender, pleurodont denticles\r\narranged in a single row on the jaws or as tubercular eruptions on the\r\npalate bones, with a large pulp-cavity and the enamel often striated. The\r\nfood of the creatures must have been small Crustacea, worms, insects, and\r\nsucculent vegetation, such as is the food of the modern Amphibia.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The _occiput_ is formed of partially ossified (465) ex- and\r\nbasi-occipitals, though these elements are never firmly united by ossific\r\nunion. Often a pair of condyles occur, one on either exoccipital. The\r\nocciput was usually, however, cartilaginous and no trace of its structure\r\nis preserved.\r\n\r\n(_f_) The _mandible_ is usually as long as the skull and is slender. It\r\nis composed of 6 elements so far as known (465); these are the articular,\r\nthe surangular, the angular, the coronoid, the dentary, and the splenial.\r\nOther elements may be present, but the anatomy of this portion of the\r\nanimals is not very completely known. The bones are sculptured and cut by\r\nlateral-line canals (458) in a few forms. Whether the articular operated\r\non an osseous or cartilaginous quadrate is unknown, though certain\r\nspecimens seem to indicate an osseous condition for that element. The\r\nanterior symphysis was doubtless ligamentous, the halves always separating\r\nbefore fossilization. The dentary always bears a single row of pleurodont\r\nteeth, which may vary greatly in size and number.\r\n\r\n(_g_) The _hyoid apparatus_ is well preserved in a few forms (123).\r\nDoubtless it was present in all of them, though it has seldom been\r\npreserved. The condition of the hyobranchial apparatus in _Cocytinus\r\ngyrinoides_ (text-fig. 16) from the Coal Measures of Linton, Ohio,\r\nseems to indicate that the species was a perennibranchiate salamander\r\n(123). It is well known from the studies of Credner that the European\r\nBranchiosauria, in the young, possessed external branchiæ (187) supported\r\nby lateral basibranchials. The gill-arches seem to have been slightly\r\ncalcified or ossified in a few cases, and they supported denticle-like\r\nprojections which bore the gill-filaments. When the Branchiosauria had\r\nattained a length of 100 mm. or more they lost their gills (187). This\r\nchange was accompanied by the reduction of the tail, expansion of the\r\npelvis, and increase in ossification of the skull and skeletal elements.\r\nGills have not yet been detected among the American Branchiosauria.\r\n\r\n(_h_) The _eye_ in a few species had a large amount of black pigment,\r\nas indicated by the blackening of the stone in the Mazon Creek nodules.\r\nProfessor Cope (107) thought that this would indicate a nocturnal and\r\ncrepuscular habit for these vertebrates, since the _pigmentum nigrum_ of\r\nthe choroid is largely developed. Other than this suggestion nothing is\r\nknown of the soft parts of the head.\r\n\r\n(_i_) The _alimentary canal_ (text-fig. 7) is beautifully preserved\r\nas a cast in three specimens of the American branchiosaur species\r\n_Eumicrerpeton parvum_ Moodie (471) from the Mazon Creek beds. The nodules\r\nwhich contain these interesting little fossils measure less than 3 inches\r\nin long diameter. The fossil salamanders, about 30 mm. in length, are\r\npreserved on their backs and occur as nearly as is possible in the center\r\nof the nodule.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the fact that the œsophagus became loosened and dropped\r\nfrom its place shortly after death, the alimentary canal would be in\r\nplace and would immediately recall a freshly dissected specimen of a\r\nrecent salamander. The anterior end of the œsophagus lies obliquely across\r\nthe chest region with its tip pointing slightly downward. The length\r\nof the œsophagus proper, in one specimen, is only about 3 mm. As it is\r\npreserved, the œsophagus lies in a semi-sigmoid curve with the convexity\r\nanterior, and enters the cardiac portion of the stomach by a gradual\r\nconstriction. The stomach is clearly preserved as a distinct sac-like\r\norgan with two lobes which correspond to the cardiac and pyloric limbs.\r\nIt measures about 7 mm. in length by 2 mm. in its greatest diameter.\r\nThe muscular constriction which divides the organ into pyloric and\r\ncardiac divisions occurs at a distance of 4 mm. from the upper end. The\r\npylorus is designated by a rather pronounced constriction which may be\r\npartly accidental, although it recalls the pylorus of modern frogs. From\r\nthis constriction, which lies on the left side of the fossil, as it is\r\npreserved, the duodenal portion of the intestine makes a straight course\r\nposteriorly to near the anal region, where it takes a sharp bend and\r\ncurves back to run parallel with itself for the distance of 4 mm. In its\r\nupward course the intestine enlarges, and practically the same enlargement\r\ncontinues throughout the remainder of the course to the anus. At a\r\ndistance of 1 mm. from the anal end, the rectum dilates probably 0.125\r\nmm. to form the cloaca. After the intestine has continued its parallel\r\ncourse for the 4 mm., as above stated, it turns abruptly to the right for\r\na distance of 2 mm. It then runs posteriorly for a short distance, then\r\nbends back and under itself to again make a double sigmoid curve, when at\r\na distance of 6 mm. from the anus it assumes a straight course, which it\r\ncontinues to the end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Alimentary canal of Coal Measures salamander as\r\nillustrated by the smaller specimen of _Eumicrerpeton parvum_ Moodie, from\r\nthe Mazon Creek shales. × 3. Original in Yale University Museum. _a_,\r\nanus; _dd_, duodenum; _in_, intestine; _l_, impression of liver(?); _oes_,\r\nœsophagus; _st_, stomach.]\r\n\r\nThe anus lies at a level which is approximately that of the lower end\r\nof the femur, which is preserved as an impression on the left side of\r\nthe fossil, thus agreeing in its position with that found in modern\r\nCaudata. Lying inside the curve of the stomach and partly inclosed by the\r\nœsophagus is a smooth area which may possibly represent the impression\r\nof some of the accessory digestive glands, such as the liver. Occurring\r\nin this smooth area are numerous fine lines which possibly represent the\r\nimpressions of blood-vessels; but they are so imperfectly preserved that\r\none can not be sure.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of several genera of the modern Caudata have been\r\ndissected in order to make a direct comparison of the fossil alimentary\r\ncanal with that of the recent forms. The alimentary tract of _Desmognathus\r\nfuscus_ Raf. from the vicinity of Ithaca, New York, resembles in a\r\nmarked degree that of the fossil form. The nearest approach to the\r\ncondition there represented is found, however, in an immature branchiate\r\nindividual, some 47 mm. in length, of _Diemyctylits torosus_ Esch., from\r\na fresh-water pond on Orcas Island in Puget Sound. The presence of this\r\nspecies on the island is very suggestive. It is of extreme interest, too,\r\nthat the condition represented in the alimentary tract of the fossil\r\nbranchiosaurs should resemble so closely that of an immature rather than a\r\nmature form.\r\n\r\n(_j_) The vertebral column is clearly and readily separable into cervical,\r\ndorsal, sacral, and caudal regions. The neck is always short, with from\r\n5 to 10 vertebræ, cervical ribs often present. The dorsal region is not\r\nlong, but varies from 20 to 30 in the constituent vertebræ. There is a\r\nsingle sacral vertebra not always to be readily distinguished from those\r\nof the dorsal and anterior caudal series. The tail may be very short\r\nor extremely long, with neural and hæmal spines elongate and flattened\r\ninto an oar-like appendage. The distal caudals are in some species\r\ncartilaginous, apparently always so in the Branchiosauria.\r\n\r\n(_k_) The _atlas_ and _axis_ are unknown among the American specimens, but\r\nwe are able to infer from the structure of the other vertebræ what this\r\nmust have been; and our inferences are partly confirmed by the conditions\r\nexisting in the European forms (187). The atlas, apparently, consisted of\r\na pair of neurocentral plates which are partly ossified, partly embedded\r\nin cartilage, judging from the edges of the plates which have been\r\npreserved. The centrum seems not to have been present in the atlas, or if\r\npresent it was only very slightly developed and quite free from the neural\r\npieces and largely embedded in cartilage. A fairly accurate picture of the\r\ncondition of the _atlas_ and _axis_ may be seen on examining a cow, pig,\r\nor chick embryo (378) in the early stages of vertebral development, which\r\nhas been cleared by the Schultze method (Amer. Journ. Anat., VII, No. 4,\r\n1908).\r\n\r\n(_l_) The _dorsal vertebræ_, as well as those of the other series, present\r\na primitive character (fig. 8) in the persistence of the notochord\r\n(540). Among the Branchiosauria the notochord was not at all or but\r\nslightly constricted intravertebrally, but among the Microsauria it was\r\nconstricted so far that the notochordal remnants in each centrum resemble\r\nan hour-glass.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the vertebræ among American forms agrees fully with that\r\noutlined by Credner, Fritsch, and others for the European species. The\r\ndetails of structure are so fully given by Zittel (642, pp. 346-353) and\r\nby Schwarz (540, 541) that it will not be necessary to state more here\r\nas to their structure, since there is nothing new to add concerning the\r\nAmerican species.\r\n\r\nThe temnospondylous vertebra of the same nature and type as exhibited by\r\nthe Permian forms has its representatives (94, 478) in the Coal Measures.\r\n_Spondylerpeton spinatum_ Moodie (478) (plate 4, figs. 1, 2) and _Eryops_\r\nsp. (plate 18, fig. 2) indicate the embolomerous and rachitomous types\r\nof vertebral structure. The occurrence of these widely different types\r\nof vertebral structure indicates a long history for the group prior to\r\nthe Coal Measures. This history is further indicated by footprints in the\r\nMississippian and Devonian of this continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Vertebræ and ribs of Amphibia from the Coal\r\nMeasures of Linton, Ohio.

The characters\r\nof the ribs and vertebræ constitute the best means of classification\r\nof these animals so far discovered. In the Branchiosauria the ribs are\r\nalways straight, heavy, and short, and articulate intravertebrally upon a\r\nlarge and strong transverse process. They occur throughout the vertebral\r\ncolumn. There is a single pair of sacral ribs which are not to be clearly\r\ndistinguished from the pre-sacral and post-sacral series. The cervical\r\nand caudal ribs are shorter than the dorsal series. The branchiosaurian\r\nrib is composed almost entirely of perichondral ossification. It presents\r\nthe same condition as does the humerus of the cow embryo of 2 to 3 inches\r\nin length. The ribs of the branchiosaurs are identical in every way with\r\nthe ribs of modern salamanders and form one of the strong arguments in\r\nfavor of the relationship of the Branchiosauria to the Caudata. Among the\r\nMicrosauria the ribs are always long, slender, curved, and intercentral.\r\nThey may be either single or double headed, but usually the former. They\r\nresemble in their characters the ribs of some of the early reptiles and\r\nan attempt has been made to relate the Microsauria (469) to the primitive\r\nreptiles on this basis. The ribs of the other groups are still unknown.\r\nIndeed, representatives of the Temnospondylia and the Stereospondylia are\r\nvery scanty in the American Coal Measures. One large rib (plate 22, fig.\r\n4) may represent a labyrinthodont, but nothing is known of the species to\r\nwhich the rib belonged.\r\n\r\n(_n_) The _pectoral girdle_ (187) is a very simple and uniform structure,\r\nalthough the details of the association of the elements still remain to\r\nbe determined. A single, median, usually large and elongate interclavicle\r\noccupies the ventral line of the chest. This is morphologically the same\r\nelement which occurs in the middle line of the chest of the lizards.\r\nIt is a dermal bone and is usually, especially among the Microsauria\r\n(462), highly sculptured. It varies considerably in size and shape, but\r\nis remarkably uniform throughout the various groups. Lying anterior to\r\nthe interclavicle and overlapping its antero-lateral margins lie the two\r\nclavicles, which are usually diamond-shaped and are sculptured, dermal\r\nbones. The position of the coracoid is still uncertain, and in fact its\r\nclear association in the pectoral girdle of these species is still a\r\nquestion. It seems to be constant in the European (186, 251) species and\r\nis usually represented by a small rounded plate of bone, which in life no\r\ndoubt had a large amount of cartilage to form its borders. A cleithrum\r\n(285) has been ascribed to one of the Linton, Ohio, species (plate 15,\r\nfig. 3) by Jaekel (347), but this needs confirmation. An osseous scapula\r\nis usually present, resembling the scapula of modern salamanders, in that\r\nit was largely embedded in cartilage. The position of the pectoral girdle\r\nis largely a matter of doubt, especially for the American species. After\r\ndeath and before fossilization the girdle was always moved by post-mortem\r\nshifting, so that its exact relation to the ribs and vertebral column\r\nis still in doubt. Credner (186) has restored the pectoral girdle close\r\nbehind the head, which would cause an amount of rigidity in the body which\r\nprobably did not exist.\r\n\r\n(_o_) The _arm_ consists of the humerus, radius, ulna, and 4 digits.\r\nThe characters of the arm-bones are such as is constant among primitive\r\nanimals and developing mammals. The osseous portion is perichondral.\r\nEpiphyses are totally lacking and it is doubtful if the endochondrium was\r\nat all ossified. The digits are often terminated by ungual phalanges,\r\nalthough usually the terminal phalanx was merely embedded in the web of\r\nthe foot; and among the terrestrial forms a claw was well developed. An\r\nosseous carpus is not known in the species from the Coal Measures. Its\r\nimpression indicates a broad hand, well adapted for swimming.\r\n\r\n(p) The _pelvic girdle_ consists uniformly (462) of the ilium and\r\nischium. A small rounded pubis is present in some of the later forms of\r\nAmphibia; it is, however, totally absent from the Coal Measures species.\r\nThe condition of the pelvis is paralleled by the partially grown pelvis\r\nof mammalian embryos in which the elements ossify in the order of ilium,\r\nischium, and pubis. The ilium is always the larger of the elements. It\r\nsupported or was attached to the sacral rib by means of a ligamentous\r\nunion. The ischium did not ossify completely until the animal was nearly\r\nmature. The union between the elements of the pelvis was probably of a\r\nloose, membranous sort or else the whole mass was embedded in cartilage;\r\nof the two hypotheses the former is the more probable.\r\n\r\nThe pubis is indicated as a calcified quadrangular plate in a specimen of\r\n_Amphibamus grandiceps_ Cope (478) from the Mazon Creek shales, and it is\r\npresent as a rounded osseous element among some of the Permian forms.\r\n\r\n(_q_) The _leg_ (fig. 21, B) is composed of the femur, tibia, fibula,\r\nand 5 digits. The tarsus is usually cartilaginous, a single osseous\r\ntarsus (483, 484) being known (plate 23, fig. 1) from America. The distal\r\nphalanges may or may not be clawed, depending on the habits of life of the\r\nanimal. The elements of the leg are ossified in a similar manner to those\r\nof the arm.\r\n\r\n(_r_) The _ventral scutellation_ (fig. 9), so commonly present among\r\nall groups of Amphibia in the Coal Measures, consists of a series of\r\nossifications or calcifications in the myocommata. Among modern amphibians\r\nthey occur as thin perpendicular planes of connective-tissue which are\r\nsometimes cartilaginous, especially in _Necturus_, regarded by Wilder\r\n(Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History, vol. V, No. 9, p.\r\n400, fig. 6, 1903) and by Wiedersheim (605, p. 58) as a homologue or\r\npredecessor of the sternum, although Wiedersheim says:\r\n\r\n  \"The sternum appears for the first time in Amphibians in the form of\r\n  a small variously shaped plate of cartilage situated in the middle\r\n  line of the chest. It arises as a paired cartilaginous plate in the\r\n  inscriptiones tendineæ of the rectus abdominis muscle, and therefore\r\n  may be looked upon as corresponding to a pair of 'abdominal ribs.'\r\n  Such cartilaginous abdominal ribs must have been present in greater\r\n  numbers in the ancestors of existing Urodeles.\"\r\n\r\nThis supposition is fully sustained by the anatomy of the Branchiosauria\r\n(459), which must be looked upon as the actual ancestors of the Caudata.\r\nWilder says of these structures in _Necturus_ (_op. cit._, p. 400):\r\n\r\n  \"The several cartilaginous rudiments which represent this part\r\n  (_i.e._, sternum) in _Necturus_ are somewhat difficult of detection\r\n  and thus entirely escaped the attention of the earlier investigators.\r\n  They consist of a number of thin cartilages found in several\r\n  successive myocommata of the pectoral region and confined mainly to\r\n  the area covered by the overlapping epicoracoids.\"\r\n\r\nThe homologue of the _ventral scutellæ_ is found in plesiosaurs,\r\ncrocodiles, _Sphenodon_, and other reptiles in the \"abdominal ribs,\" and\r\nthe same myocommatous ossifications undoubtedly go to the formation of the\r\nchelonian plastron. What the causes were which produced the development\r\nof the ventral scutellæ to such a high degree among the primitive land\r\nvertebrates is uncertain, but they are certainly more highly developed\r\namong the primitive reptiles and amphibians than among the later members\r\nof those classes. Among the Amphibia of the Coal Measures they attained,\r\nin some forms, a high degree of development and differentiation. They are\r\npresent in all families so far known, except the Tuditanidæ, in which\r\nthe myocommata may have been cartilaginous. The Sauropleuridæ present\r\nthe highest development of these structures among the American forms, in\r\nwhich the scutes are large and osseous. Among the Branchiosauria they\r\nare calcified or partially ossified and are always arranged _en chevron_\r\non the belly, chest, arms, and throat, their arrangement and direction\r\nof the _chevron_ being modified according to the myomeres of the various\r\nregions. The ventral scutellæ of the European Branchiosauria are figured\r\nand described fully by Credner (192, p. 21, figs. 4 to 11).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Ventral scutellæ of _Micrerpeton caudatum_, a Coal\r\nMeasures salamander from Mazon Creek. × 5. _f_, femur; _h_, humerus; _ls_,\r\nlines of scutes; _v_, vertebral column.]\r\n\r\n(_s_) _Scales_ (fig. 10 and plate 24, figs. 2 and 3) are present on the\r\nbody of (462, 485) several species. It is a matter of regret that their\r\npreservation is so imperfect that nothing can be found out as to their\r\nstructure. The Linton species, which possess scales, are, of course,\r\ncarbonized and hence impracticable for microscopic study, and in the\r\nMazon Creek species of _Amphibamus_ and _Micrerpeton_ the scales have\r\nbeen replaced by kaolin. The bodies of two species (_Cercariomorphus\r\nparvisquamis_ and _Ichthyerpeton squamosum_) of the Linton Coal Measures\r\nAmphibia were completely scaled. The scales in the Branchiosauria (462),\r\nso far as they have been observed, are slightly imbricated; rounded, with\r\nconcentric markings after the manner of the modern cyprinoid fish-scale.\r\nThey are extremely minute, and whether or not they covered the entire body\r\nof the animal is unknown. On the body of _Cercariomorphus_ the scales\r\nhave the appearance of being tubercular without imbrication, and they\r\napparently covered the entire bodily surface of the animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Horny armor of back of _Hylonomus_. _a_,\r\nimbricated scales; _b_, horny plates; _c_, horny spines or tubercles; _d_,\r\nsmall imbricated scales. (After Dawson, based on a photograph.)]\r\n\r\nAmong the Paleozoic Amphibia from Nova Scotia as described by Dawson and\r\nOwen (193, 201, 485) scales are well developed and frequent, although the\r\ndetails as to their occurrence on the bodies of the animals are still\r\nunknown, since the Nova Scotian species are all based on very fragmentary\r\nremains. Dawson (208, p. 34) has given a detailed discussion of the\r\ndiscovery and anatomy of the various types of scales possessed by the\r\nspecies from the Coal Measures of Nova Scotia. Suffice it to say here that\r\nnone of the scales appear to be bony, but have a cuticular appearance\r\nwith concentric markings. Some of them are tubercular, and Dawson thought\r\nthat a few specimens indicated that some of the species possessed scaly\r\nlappets and a dorsal nuchal fringe of scaly skin along the back. He has\r\nindicated these facts in his restorations of the forms. The scales were\r\nall carbonized and burned readily with a strong flame. A section of the\r\nscale shows a thick upper corium with a vascular body (208, pl. IV, fig.\r\n29) much like a fish-scale. Fragments of the skin were also preserved with\r\nthe scales. Dawson says of the skin:\r\n\r\n  \"One of my specimens is a flattened portion of cuticle two and a\r\n  quarter inches in length. The greater part of the surface is smooth\r\n  and shining to the naked eye, and under the microscope shows only a\r\n  minute granulation. A limited portion of the upper and, I suppose,\r\n  anterior part is covered with imbricated scales, which must have been\r\n  membranous or horny, and generally have a small spot or pore near the\r\n  outer margin, some having in addition smaller scales or points on\r\n  their surfaces\" (208, pl. IV, figs. 22 and 25).\r\n\r\n(_t_) _Muscle_ tissue (fig. 21) is preserved in a single specimen,\r\npreviously described by the writer (464, p. 17, pl. 7, fig. 1). The\r\ncarbonized muscles show a myomeric arrangement and the portions preserved\r\nprobably represent one of the recti muscles of the abdominal wall.\r\n\r\n(_u_) The _lateral-line system_ in the Coal Measures Amphibia will be\r\nbest understood from a comparative review of the occurrence of these\r\norgans among all extinct Amphibia. Since all the orders of Amphibia are\r\nrepresented in the Coal Measures, such a review will not be out of place\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the lateral-line system among ancient Amphibia is due\r\nto the fact that the skull of many forms (especially the later and larger)\r\nare grooved and marked by a regular series of furrows and pits, in which\r\nthe sense-organs of the lateral-line system were contained (see fig. 6),\r\nas well as by the preservation of a series of clearly marked scales on\r\nthe sides of the tails and bodies of others. The grooves are never arched\r\nover as in the Macropetalichthyidæ, where \"in favorable specimens each is\r\nshown to be covered by a delicate roof perforated by two lines of minute\r\nopenings\" (Dean, N. Y. Acad. Sci. Mem., vol. II, pl. III, p. 115). They\r\nare always widely opened canals, either with perfectly smooth bottoms\r\nand sides or roughened with large pits, or even becoming a series of\r\nwell-marked pits. An attempt has been made (458) to homologize the organs\r\nwith those of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature adopted here for the canals does not depart from that\r\nused by Allis for _Amia_ (Journ. of Morphology, vol. II, 1889). The\r\nsupraorbital and infraorbital canals are readily correlated with those of\r\nthe same name in fishes, where they are very clearly marked. The anterior\r\ncommissure is also homologous with that of the fishes, as is also the\r\ncanal here called the \"antorbital commissure.\" The others are not so\r\nreadily homologized. The upper canal (see fig. 6) in the posterior part\r\nof the cranium is here designated the _temporal canal_. It is, however,\r\nclearly a part of the infraorbital of the fishes. Its relations in the\r\nStegocephala are such that a new name is deemed necessary. The _jugal\r\ncanal_ is, I believe, a new formation in Amphibia. The transverse canal of\r\nthe amphibian skull is homologous with the \"occipital cross-commissure.\"\r\n\r\nThe figure (see fig. 6) is a composite picture of the lateral-line system\r\nof the higher or truly stegocephalous Amphibia. The outline of the skull\r\nis based on that of _Eryops_. All of the canals do not exist on any one\r\nskull or in any one order, but all are found somewhere in the group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\n\r\n  A.

The system as there defined\r\nhas been fully discussed in the description of the anatomical details of\r\nthe species, to which reference may be made for further data (pp. 52-60).\r\nSuffice it to say here that the system of sense-organs there preserved\r\nis identical with that of the larval _Necturus_; the lines arising as a\r\n_median_ from the tip of the tail and a _dorsal_ springing from the median\r\nat a distance of a few millimeters from the tip of the tail. The lines are\r\nmore evident on account of the fact that the lateral-line sense-organs\r\nwere located under specialized pigmented scales. The significance of the\r\nclose similarity between the arrangement of the lateral-line systems on\r\nthe tail of Necturus, _Micrerpeton_, and _Eumicrerpeton_ is doubtless of\r\ngenetic (459) importance, indicating the origin of the caudate Amphibia\r\nfrom the Branchiosauria by a degenerative or recessive evolution in other\r\nstructural characters. This system of sense-organs has been described in\r\nno other branchiosaurian.\r\n\r\nThe Microsauria (458) are exceedingly interesting in possessing a very\r\npeculiar type of lateral-line system. It is known in a few forms and in\r\none specimen especially well (_Erpetosaurus tabulatus_) (fig. 22, G). In\r\nthis species, which is represented by a single imperfect skull, there are\r\nevidences of a nearly complete lateral-line system of canals and pits.\r\nThe occipital cross-commissure is represented on the posterior border\r\nof the skull by a row of elongate pits such as Andrews described for\r\n_Ceraterpeton_ (8). I fail to find in American species the pores described\r\nby Andrews. The temporal canal forms with the jugal canal a complete ring,\r\nmuch as it is in _Trematosaurus_, only in _Erpetosaurus tabulatus_ the\r\ntemporal canal does not touch the tabulare. I think there are indications\r\nof a connection of the temporal canal with the supraorbital. The temporal\r\ncanal cuts the supratemporal, the squamosal, and jugal. The jugal canal\r\nlies for the most part on the supratemporal and quadratojugal, and joins\r\nthe infraorbital on the jugal. A portion only of the infraorbital canal\r\nis preserved. There is also a portion of the supraorbital canal. It seems\r\nnot to be connected with the temporal canal, although there is a possible\r\nindication of this connection. The supraorbital crosses the frontal,\r\nprefrontal, and a part of the nasal. The squamosal element is peculiar\r\nin _Erpetosaurus tabulatus_ in that it is excluded from the parietal by\r\nthe extension of the tabulare and postorbital. This condition is found in\r\nseveral other species of the Microsauria. It will be noticed that with the\r\nchanged condition of the squamosal the temporal canal has changed also,\r\nand this is further proof of the close connection between the cranial\r\nelements and the lateral-line canals, as Allis has maintained for _Amia_.\r\n(See in this connection C. J. Herrick, Journ. Comp. Neurol., vol. II, p.\r\n224, 1901.)\r\n\r\nThe Diplocaulia, an amphibian order allied to the Branchiosauria (477)\r\nand through them to the Caudata, have the lateral-line system apparently\r\nwell-developed. The skulls are always crushed flat, so that the canals\r\nare nearly obliterated. On the mandible, however, the canals are clearly\r\ndistinct and apparently run the entire course around the mandibular rami.\r\nOn a well-preserved skull of _Diplocaulus magnicornis_ Cope there are\r\nindications of three lateral-line canals (477, pl. 1). The infraorbital\r\nis clearly marked as a well-defined groove just below the orbit. The\r\nsupraorbital is indicated only for a short distance, and there are\r\nindications of the temporal canal. The operculo-mandibular canal has\r\nits course, for the most part, near the middle of the rami, but as it\r\napproaches the posterior angle of the mandible it suddenly changes its\r\ncourse and drops down to the lower edge, only to rise again and to come\r\nout strongly marked near the median plane on the posterior angle of the\r\nmandible.\r\n\r\nThe Temnospondylia, as represented by _Eryops_, _Cricotus_, and\r\n_Archegosaurus_, possess well-developed lateral-line canals (458). H.\r\nvon Meyer (428) many years ago made out the course of the canals in\r\n_Archegosaurus_. The greater part of the following description is based\r\non _Eryops megacephalus_ Cope from the Texas Permian. The entire surface\r\nof the cranial elements in _Eryops_, as in other of the Stegocephala\r\n(458), is covered with coarse pits. The fossæ are present even in\r\nthe bottoms of the grooves which represent the lateral-line system,\r\nand are more marked in the members of the Temnospondylia than in the\r\nStereospondylia.\r\n\r\nThe occipital cross-commissure occurs in a well-developed form in\r\n_Eryops_. It is short and ends abruptly within the limits of the tabulare.\r\nIts ends are occupied by large pits. The commissure, as in _Amia_, grooves\r\nthe postparietal and the tabulare elements. There is no evidence of an\r\nanterior commissure. I think there is evidence of a temporal canal on the\r\nleft side of the skull, but am not sure. The jugal and infraorbital canals\r\nare well developed and strongly connected. The jugal canal starts far back\r\non the supratemporal, and after curving around over the quadratojugal\r\njoins the infraorbital, or rather becomes a part of that canal, somewhere\r\non the jugal. There is nothing unusual in the infraorbital. The antorbital\r\ncommissure is well developed. It is longer and better developed than in\r\nany other known form. The supraorbital canal starts in the region of the\r\norbit, and after curving downwards to meet the antorbital commissure, ends\r\nabruptly anterior to the nostril. There are faint traces of a lateral-line\r\ncanal, the operculo-mandibular, on a poorly preserved mandible of\r\n_Eryops_. It does not differ greatly from that described below for\r\n_Anaschisma_.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Archegosaurus_ has been known for more than a century, we\r\nhave had no adequate discussion of the manner of occurrence of the\r\nlateral-line canals. Burmeister (80) gave a figure of the canals as he\r\nthought they occurred on the cranium, but H. von Meyer (428) states that\r\nthe representation is inaccurate, and they seem to be based largely on\r\n_Trematosaurus_.\r\n\r\nThe lateral-line canals occur in well-developed form on the skulls of\r\nthe Stereospondylia. The sutures between the elements of the skull are\r\nusually clearly marked by smooth, narrow grooves. The lateral-line canals\r\ncan always be distinguished from the sutural grooves by the shape of the\r\nbottom, being =U=-shaped in the former and =V=-shaped in the latter. The\r\nlateral-line canals also at times have their bottoms roughened by pits\r\noccurring in them; the sutural grooves always have smooth bottoms. The\r\nlateral-line canals are usually rather shallow and sometimes broad, with\r\nthe edges of the grooves more or less perpendicular, but in _Metoposaurus_\r\nthe canals are deep and the borders are sharply incised.\r\n\r\nThe temporal canals in _Anaschisma_ from the Triassic (49) of Wyoming\r\nare represented by broken furrows. The portions preserved exhibit the\r\nusual downward tendency to unite with the infraorbital on the postorbital\r\nelement. In its course forward from the epiotic the temporal canal cuts\r\nthe squamosal. The supraorbital canal has an unusually deviating course\r\nin _Anaschisma_, but aside from the minor twists and curves it does not\r\ndiffer essentially from the same canal in other forms. It ends abruptly\r\non the anterior end of the muzzle. In its course it gives off the vestige\r\nof an antorbital commissure which tends to join a vestige from the\r\ninfraorbital canal. The jugal canal begins broadly at the very posterior\r\nedge of the skull as though it were continued, as it undoubtedly was, to\r\nthe body of the animal. In its course forward it joins the infraorbital\r\ncanal on the jugal. The course of the infraorbital is not unusual in\r\nany respect. There is no anterior commissure on the skull, nor is the\r\noccipital cross-commissure developed on either skull of the genus at hand.\r\n\r\nThere are distinct evidences of an operculo-mandibular lateral-line canal\r\non the mandibles. The canal enters the mandible on the surangular and\r\npasses forward around the mandible as described for _Diplocaulus_ (477).\r\n\r\nOther members of the Stereospondylia, such as _Mastodonsaurus_,\r\n_Metoposaurus_, and _Trematosaurus_ possess well-developed lateral-line\r\ncanals, but the above description fits, in a general way, the condition in\r\nall genera; and for our present purposes that will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE AMPHIBIA OF THE DEVONIAN AND MISSISSIPPIAN OF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidences of the earliest land vertebrates are exceedingly scanty in the\r\nstrata between the close of the Silurian and the opening of the Coal\r\nMeasures, being represented solely by footprints. In the Devonian our\r\nknowledge of the group is confined to a single footprint, and in the\r\nMississippian to series of footprints from several localities. These\r\nhave been described by Lea (371), Rogers (Geology of Pennsylvania, pt.\r\nII, 1856, p. 831), Barrell (21), Dawson (223), and Branson (50). The\r\nlast-named author has described a new species from the Mississippian\r\nof Giles County, Virginia. His description of the footprints, with a\r\nphotograph of one of the series, are published herewith (plate 18, fig.\r\n3).

These impressions are\r\n  of much interest, both on account of their geological age and the size\r\n  and character of the footprints themselves. The one best preserved\r\n  [fig. 12] is nearly 4 inches in length, 2.25 inches in width, and was\r\n  apparently made by the left hind foot. On the inner side in front of\r\n  the heel, a portion of the margin is split off, and this may have\r\n  contained the imprint of another toe. The other footprint was a short\r\n  distance in front, but only the posterior portion is now preserved in\r\n  the present specimen. It is probably the imprint of the forefoot.\r\n\r\n  \"The specimen [plate 18, fig. 4] ... was ... found in the town of\r\n  Pleasant, one mile south of the Allegheny River, Warren County,\r\n  Pennsylvania, by Dr Charles E. Beecher, who presented it to Yale\r\n  Museum, where it still remains.\r\n\r\n  \"The geological horizon is near the top of the Chemung in the\r\n  upper Devonian. In the same beds are ripple marks, mud cracks,\r\n  and impressions of rain drops, indicating shallow water and shore\r\n  deposits. Land plants are found in the same general horizon. Marine\r\n  molluscs also occur, and one characteristic form (_Nuculana_) is\r\n  preserved in the footprint slab\" (Marsh).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.

(Plate 18, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe following description of the shales and footprints are from Dr.\r\nBranson's paper cited above:\r\n\r\n  \"The Hinton shales, like the Mauch Chunk, seem to have been subaerial\r\n  in origin and are made up for the most part of variegated shales\r\n  interbedded with thin layers of argillaceous, fine-grained sandstone.\r\n  The footprints occur in fine-grained sandstone, and remains of land\r\n  plants are not uncommon in the same beds.\r\n\r\n  \"Twenty-two footprints made by one animal walking in a straight\r\n  course were collected in a slab. They give the impression of having\r\n  been made by a bipedal animal for part of the distance, but after the\r\n  fourth print of the right foot impressions of the forefeet appear. The\r\n  hindfeet had 5 digits, the middle digit being longest and the 2 inside\r\n  of it being only slightly shorter and lying close together. Their\r\n  outer ends were slender and flexible and usually curved inward toward\r\n  the middle toe. The 2 outer digits formed wide angles with the middle\r\n  one and were shorter than the inner ones. The second toe was webbed to\r\n  within 8 mm. of the tip, the third toe to within 23 mm. of the tip.\r\n  The impression of the web is well preserved in only one impression of\r\n  the hindfoot.\r\n\r\n  \"The forefeet had 4 digits. The 3 inner digits were subequal in\r\n  length, the 2 inner being more flexible and incurved near the ends.\r\n  The outer digit is two-thirds as long as the second.

A\r\nclassification of some sort is necessary for the proper grouping of the\r\nspecies which have been recovered from the Coal Measures deposits of this\r\ncontinent, and my reason for publishing this relatively dry material is\r\nthat the classifications formerly proposed (469), as well as the one here\r\ngiven, may have a proper historical background.\r\n\r\nThe review of the proposed systems of classification has been much\r\nfacilitated by the discovery, in the University of Chicago, of some\r\nnotes by the late Dr. George Baur on the \"Stegocephali.\" The notes were\r\nnot discovered until after the literature had been pretty thoroughly\r\ncovered, and it was a source of some gratification, on comparing notes\r\nwith those of Dr. Baur, to find but few omissions. Whether Dr. Baur had\r\never contemplated a work on the Stegocephala or not I have been unable to\r\nlearn, but it is certain that he carefully and laboriously went through\r\nthe literature on the subject and copied by hand the classifications of\r\neach author from 1842 to 1895, together with other notes of interest on\r\nthe structure, distribution, and phylogeny, including many tracings. The\r\nclassifications given below are taken, in part, from his notes, although\r\nall references have been verified with the original sources.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to combine in classification the knowledge of the\r\nextinct and recent amphibians was made by Johannes Jacob von Tschudi in\r\n1839 (574). Previous to that time Goldfuss (295) and von Meyer (418) had\r\ndescribed various species of salamanders and frogs from the Tertiary\r\ndeposits of Switzerland, and these Tschudi considered in his following\r\nclassification:\r\n\r\n  A. Ranæ.\r\n       _a._ _Hylæ._\r\n       _b._ _Cystignathi._\r\n       _c._ _Ranæ._\r\n       _d._ _Ceratophrydes._\r\n       _e._ _Bombinatores._\r\n       _f._ _Bufones._\r\n       _g._ _Pipæ._\r\n  B. Cœciliæ.\r\n       _a._ _Cœciliæ._\r\n  C. Salamandrinæ.\r\n       _a._ _Pleurodeles._\r\n       _b._ _Salamandræ._\r\n       _c._ _Tritones._\r\n       _d._ _Tritonides._\r\n  D. Protoideæ.\r\n\r\nAlthough the remains of _Mastodonsaurus_ had been known and widely\r\ncommented on for several years before Tschudi proposed this scheme, he\r\ndoes not include this genus in his classification of the Amphibia, for\r\nthe reason that for nearly a quarter of a century after the discovery of\r\nthe labyrinthodonts they were regarded as reptiles, even so eminent an\r\nauthority as von Meyer (423) including them in his \"System der fossilen\r\nSaurier.\" The view that the labyrinthodonts were reptiles was at times\r\ndisputed, but no one seemed to pay any attention to the argument of\r\nQuenstedt in 1850 that \"Die Mastodonsaurier im grünen Keupersandstein\r\nWürtemburgs sind Batrachier\" (527), nor to the contention of Vogt (581) in\r\n1854 that \"Archegosaurus und alle Labyrinthodonten sind Amphibien, nicht\r\nReptilien.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1842 von Meyer (420) proposed to include all the early forms allied\r\nto the _Mastodonsaurus_ in the \"Labyrinthodontes.\" His definition of the\r\ngroup follows:\r\n\r\nLabyrinthodontes: Saurier deren Zahn-Struktur jener ähnlich ist, welche in\r\nden nach prismatischer Art gebauten Säugethier-Zähnen wahrgenommen wird,\r\nu.s.w.\r\n\r\n      I. _Mastodonsaurus Jaeger._ (_Salamandroides_ Jaeger,\r\n           _Batrachosaurus_ Fitzinger, _Labyrinthodon_ Owen.)\r\n           _M. Jaegeri_ Meyer.\r\n     II. _Capitosaurus_ Münster.\r\n         _C. arenaceus_ Münst.\r\n         _C. robustus_ Meyer.\r\n    III. _Metopias_ Meyer.\r\n         _M. diagnosticus_ Meyer.\r\n\r\nThree years later von Meyer (423) proposed his \"System der fossilen\r\nSaurier,\" where the extinct Amphibia are treated as follows:\r\n\r\nLabyrinthodontes.\r\n\r\n    1. Prosthopthalmi (Augen-höhlen in der vordern Hälfte der\r\n         Schädel-Länge)                          _Metopias_ Meyer Keuper.\r\n    2. Mesopthalmi (Augen-höhlen in der mitte der Schädel)\r\n                             _Mastodonsaurus_ Jaeger Keuper, Muschelkalk.\r\n    3. Opisthopthalmi (Augen-höhlen in der hintern Hälfte der\r\n         Schädel-Länge)                    _Capitosaurus_ Münster Keuper.\r\n    4. Labyrinthodonten ungewisser Stellung.\r\n        _Labyrinthodon_ Owen                                      Keuper.\r\n        _Xestorrhytias_ Meyer                                Muschelkalk.\r\n        _Odontosaurus_ Meyer                            Bunter Sandstein.\r\n        _Trematosaurus_ Braun                           Bunter Sandstein.\r\n\r\nNo other classification was proposed for the extinct Amphibia for 15\r\nyears, when Owen (512) in 1859 proposed the new order Ganocephala and\r\nretained von Meyer's Labyrinthodontes under Labyrinthodontia. Owen's\r\nclassification is as follows:\r\n\r\nClass--Reptilia.\r\nOrder I. Ganocephala.\r\n      Genera: _Archegosaurus_, _Dendrerpeton_, _Raniceps_.\r\nOrder II. Labyrinthodontia.\r\n      Genera: _Mastodonsaurus_, _Anisopus_, _Trematosaurus_, _Metopias_,\r\n        _Capitosaurus_, _Zygosaurus_, _Xestorrhytias_.\r\n\r\nIn his Paleontology published in 1861, Owen gives the same classification,\r\nbut adds new genera.\r\n\r\nHuxley in 1863 (332) did not accept Owen's Ganocephala, but instead\r\nproposed the following:\r\n\r\nLabyrinthodontia.\r\n  A. Archegosauria. _Archegosaurus_, _Pholidogaster_.\r\n  B. Mastodonsauria. _Mastodonsaurus_, _Labyrinthodon_, _Capitosaurus_,\r\n       _Trematosaurus_.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Dawson proposed (208) the term Microsauria to include\r\nthe genera _Hylonomus_, _Dendrerpeton_, and _Hylerpeton_, all known from\r\nthe Carboniferous rocks of Nova Scotia. Two years later Cope proposed\r\nthe new order Xenorhachia (105) for the reception of the form _Amphibamus\r\ngrandiceps_ from the Coal Measures of Illinois. He gave as the characters\r\nof this order cartilaginous vertebræ and the absence of ribs.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Owen proposed (516) the most elaborate and comprehensive scheme of\r\nclassification which had thus far been offered. His classification is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Subclass Dipnoa.\r\n    Order Ganocephala (extinct). Genera: _Archegosaurus_,\r\n      _Dendrerpeton_, etc.\r\n    Order Labyrinthodontia. Genera: _Labyrinthodon_, _Rhombopholis_, etc.\r\n    Order Batrachia.\r\n      Suborder Ophiomorpha. Family: Cœcilidæ.\r\n      Suborder Ichthyomorpha. Family: Proteidæ, Salamandridæ.\r\n      Suborder Theriomorpha (Anura).\r\n        Family 1. _Aglossa._\r\n        Family 2. _Ranidæ._\r\n        Family 3. _Hylidæ._\r\n        Family 4. _Bufonidæ._\r\n\r\nHaeckel the same year proposed (312) an entirely different scheme of\r\nclassification nd in some respects more acceptable than Owen's. Haeckel's\r\nclassification is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Class Amphibia.\r\n    Subclass I. Phractamphibia.\r\n      Ordnung i. Ganocephala.\r\n        Genera: _Archegosaurus_, _Dendrerpeton_, _Raniceps_.\r\n      Ordnung 2. Labyrinthodonta.\r\n        Genera: _Baphetes_, _Zygosaurus_, _Mastodonsaurus_,\r\n          _Trematosaurus_, _Capitosaurus_.\r\n      Ordnung 3. Peromela.\r\n    Subclass II. Lissamphibia.\r\n      Ordnung i. Socobranchia.\r\n        Genera: _Siren_, _Proteus_, _Menobranchus_, etc.\r\n      Ordnung 2. Sozura (Caudata).\r\n        Genera: _Cryptobranchus_, _Triton_, _Salamandra_.\r\n      Ordnung 3. Anura (Ecaudata).\r\n        Families: _Aglossa_, _Bufonidæ_, _Ranidæ_.\r\n\r\nThis classification is further elaborated in the edition of 1895.\r\n\r\nCope in 1868 proposed (110) the scheme of classification which was in\r\nuse for some time, although it has since suffered some change. His\r\nclassification follows:\r\n\r\nBatrachia.\r\n  Order 1. Trachystoma.\r\n  Order 2. Proteida.\r\n  Order 3. Urodela.\r\n  Order 4. Gymnophiona.\r\n  Order 5. Stegocephali.\r\n    Suborder Xenorhachia.\r\n      _Amphibamus grandiceps_ Cope.\r\n    Suborder Microsauria.\r\n      Genera: _Pelion_ Wyman, _Hylonomus_ Dawson, _Pariostegus_ Cope,\r\n        _Dendrerpeton_ Owen, _Hylerpeton_ Owen, _Brachydectes_ Cope,\r\n        _Sauropleura_ Cope, _Œstocephalus_ Cope, _Molgophis_ Cope.\r\n    Suborder Labyrinthodontia.\r\n      Genera: _Dictyocephalus_ Leidy, _Centemodon_ Lea, _Baphetes_ Owen,\r\n        _Eupelor_ Cope.\r\n\r\nHuxley in 1869 proposed (335) the following classification, which does not\r\ndiffer essentially from that proposed in 1863:\r\n\r\nAmphibia.\r\n  Order 1. Urodela.\r\n  Order 2. Batrachia.\r\n  Order 3. Gymnophiona.\r\n  Order 4. Labyrinthodontia.\r\n    Suborder Archegosauria.\r\n    Suborder Mastodonsauria.\r\n\r\nThe next classification of the extinct Amphibia of any importance was\r\nthat devised by the committee (450) for the British Association in 1874.\r\nThis committee was formed of Huxley, Harkness, Henry Woodward, Thompson,\r\nand Brigg, with Miall as secretary. This classification is, however,\r\ntoo cumbersome and has never come into general use, and indeed none but\r\nEnglish authors have paid it a great deal of attention, although the\r\ncontribution was a valuable one. The group Aistopoda, which was the ninth\r\ngroup proposed by the committee, has generally been accepted as the group\r\nrepresented by the snake-like forms. The committee's classification\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nLabyrinthodontia.\r\n  Section I. Euglypta.\r\n    Genera: _Mastodonsaurus_, Jaeger; _Capitosaurus_, Münst.; _Pachygonia_,\r\n      Huxley; _Trematosaurus_, Braun; _Gonioglyptus_, Huxley; _Metopias_,\r\n      von Meyer; _Labyrinthodon_, Owen; _Diadetognathus_, Miall;\r\n      _Dasyceps_, Huxley; _Anthracosaurus_, Huxley.\r\n\r\n  Section II. Brachyopina.\r\n    Genera: _Brachyops_, Owen; _Micropholis_, Huxley; _Rhinosaurus_,\r\n      Waldheim; _Bothriceps_, Huxley.\r\n\r\n  Section III. Chauliodonta.\r\n    Genera: _Loxomma_, Huxley; _Zygosaurus_, Eich.; _Melosaurus_, Meyer.\r\n\r\n  Section IV. Arthroödonta.\r\n    Genera: _Batrachiderpeton_, Hancock and Atthey; _Pteroplax_, Hancock\r\n      and Atthey.\r\n\r\n  Section V. An uncharacterized group.\r\n    Genera: _Pholidogaster_, Huxley; _Ichthyerpeton_, Huxley;\r\n      _Pholiderpeton_, Huxley.\r\n\r\n  Section VI. Archegosauria, von Meyer.\r\n    Genera: _Archegosaurus_, Goldfuss.\r\n\r\n  Section VII. Heleothrepta.\r\n    Genera: _Lepterpeton_, Huxley.\r\n\r\n  Section VIII. Nectridea.\r\n    Genera: _Urocordylus_, Huxley; _Keraterpeton_, Huxley.\r\n\r\n  Section IX. Aistopoda.\r\n    Genera: _Ophiderpeton_, Huxley; _Dolichosoma_, Huxley.\r\n\r\n  Section X. Microsauria, Dawson.\r\n    Genera: _Dendrerpeton_, Owen; _Hylonomus_, Dawson; _Hylerpeton_, Owen.\r\n\r\nThe schemes of classification used for the next 10 years did not depart in\r\nany appreciable degree from those already given.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Cope, in his Check-list of North American Batrachia and\r\nReptilia (120), with a systematic list of the higher groups, published\r\nthe following classification as being \"adopted provisionally by the\r\nSmithsonian Institution\":\r\n\r\n  Class Batrachia.\r\n    Order Anura.

Rachitomi.      Order   V. Urodela.\r\n  Batrachia.  { Order  II. Embolomeri.     Order  VI. Trachystomata.\r\n              { Order III. Stegocephali.   Order VII. Anura.\r\n              { Order  IV. Proteida.\r\n\r\nThe new order Rachitomi was to include forms like Eryops and the new order\r\nEmbolomeri was to include forms like Cricotus; the other orders were as\r\nthey had been given before.\r\n\r\nZittel in 1888 proposed (642) the next classification of any note in his\r\n\"Handbuch der Paleontologie,\" where it stands as follows:\r\n\r\n  Classe Amphibia.\r\n    Ordnung 1.

The term Amphibia Linné, 1758, is, according\r\nto Stejneger (550), the correct term for the entire group, and this term\r\nis adopted. The term _Stegocephala_, formerly used as a group name for\r\nthe entire Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic Amphibia, regardless of\r\nstructure, has been retained as a third subclass. The choice, so far as\r\npriority is concerned, between Labyrinthodontia and Stegocephala, is not\r\neasy. The terms, however, imply different structures. The labyrinthodonts\r\nproper have stereospondylous vertebræ, while the Stegocephala have either\r\ntemnospondylous or stereospondylous vertebræ; so the latter term has been\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe ordinal terms are those which have been used previously as subordinal,\r\nsectional, or family names, with the exception of the new ordinal term\r\n\"Diplocaulia\" (477). The term Branchiosauria is well-established, and\r\nit is here retained with the definitions previously given. The same may\r\nbe said for the Microsauria, although Dawson first (208) regarded it\r\nas a family, though giving the term an ordinal form. The Aistopoda are\r\nnot entitled to consideration as a group for reasons which are given\r\nsubsequently. The Temnospondylia and the Stereospondylia, the Embolomeri\r\nand the Rachitomi may or may not be good group names, but they have\r\npriority, so far as our knowledge of structure goes. They have been\r\nretained in their original meanings. They have been variously regarded as\r\nsections, superfamilies, groups, and subfamilies.\r\n\r\nThe following list of species is arranged according to the proposed scheme\r\nof classification:\r\n\r\n  Class Amphibia Linné, 1758.

The majority of the species are from the Linton Coal Measures,\r\nthere being 50 species described or indicated from these beds. The Mazon\r\nCreek shales have furnished 10 species; Nova Scotia 18 species; the\r\nremainder of the species are from various localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF THE CLASS AMPHIBIA LINNÉ, 1758, DEVONIAN TO RECENT.\r\n\r\n(World-wide distribution.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cold-blooded vertebrates; aquatic or partially terrestrial in\r\n  habit; body scaled or naked or partly covered with bony or horny\r\n  plates; abdomen sometimes protected by closely packed scutes,\r\n  scales, or rods; skull completely roofed-over or with a single\r\n  vacuity; pterygoid-palatine arch complete or wanting; stapes always\r\n  present; two occipital condyles, sometimes cartilaginous; skull\r\n  bones pitted and grooved by the lateral-line canals, or smooth and\r\n  lateral-line canals wanting; parasphenoid well developed; palatine\r\n  vacuities, large, small, or absent; basioccipital partly or entirely\r\n  cartilaginous; sclerotic plates present or absent; mouth always\r\n  terminal; teeth sharply conical, smooth, or plicated, with walls\r\n  sometimes extremely complicated by the infolding of the dentine and\r\n  enamel. Vertebræ procœlous, opisthocœlous, amphicœlous, amphiplatyan,\r\n  temnospondylous, stereospondylous, or cartilaginous; notochord often\r\n  persistent; column divisible into cervical, dorsal, and caudal series;\r\n  cervical series, so far as known, always short; dorsal region long\r\n  or short; a single sacral or two; caudal series short, very long, or\r\n  absent. Pectoral girdle composed of an osseous scapula, cleithrum,\r\n  clavicle, interclavicle, and coracoid with various relations; sternum\r\n  undeveloped; pectoral girdle of membrane bones; in Triassic forms\r\n  producing the effect of a plastron on account of the high development\r\n  of the clavicles and interclavicle. Pelvis usually composed of an\r\n  osseous ilium and ischium; pubis when osseous surrounded by large\r\n  amounts of cartilage, usually cartilaginous, sometimes calcified.\r\n  Limbs ambulatory, natatory, or wanting; limb bones composed either\r\n  entirely of perichondrium or of perichondrium and a small amount\r\n  of endochondrium; radius and ulna, and tibia and fibula free or\r\n  fused. Digits 3 to 5, usually 4 for the hand and 5 for the foot.\r\n  Terminal phalanges sometimes clawed. Carpus and tarsus osseous or\r\n  cartilaginous, usually the latter. Ribs never attached to a sternal\r\n  apparatus, single or double headed or intermediate, long and curved\r\n  or short and straight. Articulation with vertebral column inter- or\r\n  intra-central. Respiration both branchial and pulmonary; branchiæ\r\n  persistent and osseous in some forms. Development by metamorphosis\r\n  either in the egg membrane, on the back of the mother, or in the\r\n  water. No amnion or allantois. Heart with a single ventricle and 3 or\r\n  4 pairs of aortic arches; postcava always present in the recent forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF SUBCLASS EUAMPHIBIA, MOODIE, 1909. COAL MEASURES TO RECENT.\r\n\r\n(World-wide distribution.)\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Trans. Kans. Acad. Sci., 1909, p. 243.\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Geol. Mag., n. s., Dec. V, vol. VI, p. 220, May, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe present group was established for the reception of the Branchiosauria\r\nand their descendants, the Caudata, with the related forms, the Apoda. The\r\nSalientia are included provisionally, since there is no evidence of the\r\norigin or relationship of this group of animals to other Euamphibia save\r\nthat they have attained the same stage of evolution. They are in no way\r\nclosely related to any known group of Amphibia, recent or extinct, but\r\nthey stand on the same plane of development as the Caudata and present\r\nsimilar structures, _i.e._, a single ventricle in the heart, external\r\nbranchiæ in the young, a glandular skin, perichondral bone, and a large\r\nparasphenoid. The origin of the Salientia is a puzzle and must remain so\r\nuntil further paleontological evidence is forthcoming. Wyman, Cope, and\r\nthe writer have all remarked on the similarity of structure between the\r\nSalientia and the single known specimen of _Pelion lyelli_ Wyman from the\r\nLinton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe subclass Euamphibia may be defined as follows: Aquatic or terrestrial\r\nAmphibia; development by metamorphosis; external branchiæ present in\r\nthe young; bones almost entirely perichondral; carpus and tarsus never\r\nossified; osseous pubis absent; vertebræ usually amphicœlous with\r\npersistent notochord; ribs short and straight or flat and slightly curved,\r\nor absent; digits 4 in the hand and 5 in the foot; skull never grooved or\r\npitted, nor cut by the lateral-line canals; lateral-line organs present in\r\nthe skin; sclerotic plates present or absent; tail long and flattened or\r\nabsent.

Geol., 17, p. 39, figs. 1 to 6, 1909.\r\n\r\nType _Micrerpeton caudatum_ Moodie.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Micrerpeton_, of which the single species is described below,\r\nwas the first evidence of the occurrence of the Branchiosauria in America.\r\nThere have been three other genera referred to the Branchiosauria from\r\nNorth American deposits, but there is good evidence that none of them\r\nbelong there. The genus Amphibamus was originally referred to the\r\n_Xenorhachia_ by Cope (105, pp. 134-137) on account of the supposed\r\ncartilaginous condition of the vertebræ and the absence of ribs. Later\r\nhe abandoned this order and placed the form in the Branchiosauria, where\r\nit was retained by Zittel (642). Recently Hay has shown (316), and I am\r\nable to corroborate his statement, that ribs are present in the species,\r\nand that they are long and curved, not at all like the short ribs of\r\nthe true Branchiosauria. These long, curved ribs undoubtedly exclude\r\n_Amphibamus_ from the Branchiosauria and indicate its close affinities\r\nwith the Microsauria. The genus _Pelion_ has also been referred to this\r\norder on purely negative evidence (642, p. 375). This genus is excluded\r\nfrom the Branchiosauria by the well-ossified condition of the limb bones,\r\nin which the endochondral ossification is seen to be well developed, a\r\ncondition not found, so far, among the true Branchiosauria. The form of\r\nthe head and the elongate hind limb would also tend to exclude the genus\r\nfrom the Branchiosauria. In the Branchiosauria the fore limb is usually\r\nlarger than the hind limb, the reverse of which is the case in _Pelion_.\r\nThe genus _Sparodus_, as it occurs in North America, is uncertain. It is\r\nindicated by remains which are almost impossible of determination.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Micrerpeton_ may be distinguished from other known\r\nBranchiosauria by the large size and anterior position of the orbits,\r\nabsence of a posterior table to the skull, the short, heavy limb bones,\r\nthe slender ilium, and the expanded, elongate, and laterally compressed\r\ntail. The genus may be defined as follows: Small forms, the known\r\nrepresentative attaining a length of less than 2 inches; head broad and\r\nshort; sclerotic plates present; interorbital space less than the least\r\ndiameter of the orbit; occiput concave; pineal foramen in the line which\r\ncuts the posterior edge of the orbits; teeth small, pleurodont denticles;\r\npresacral vertebræ 20 or 21, of which probably 5 are cervical; 1 sacral;\r\nribs short, straight, and heavy, central; scapula ovoid; limbs stumpy and\r\nheavy, fore limb exceeding the hind in size; endochondral ossifications\r\ndistinctly absent; tail long, expanded, and flattened, probably provided\r\nwith a thin expanded membrane; body covered with minute, ovoid or rounded\r\nscales which are ornamented with concentric lines; color markings\r\nvertical to the long axis of the body and abundantly present on the tail;\r\nlateral-line organs represented by the dorsal and median lateral lines\r\non the tail, the sensory pits probably occurring in specialized darkened\r\nscales. Coal Measures of Mazon Creek shales near Morris, Grundy County,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Micrerpeton caudatum Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour. Geol., 17, p. 39, figs. 1-6, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 12,313, Walker Museum, University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Mazon Creek shales, near Morris, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe species is represented by very complete remains (plate 2), which are\r\npreserved on opposite halves of a nodule. The specimen was collected many\r\nyears ago by Mr. W. F. E. Gurley at Mazon Creek, but it has never before\r\nbeen studied, although Dr. Newberry examined it and said in a note that\r\nProfessor Cope should see it. Unfortunately Cope did not see it and it\r\nlay unknown for more than a quarter of a century. I am indebted to Dr.\r\nStuart Weller for calling my attention to the specimen, as well as for the\r\nprivilege of describing it.\r\n\r\nThe specimen is exceptionally perfect (plate 25, fig. 4). Nearly all the\r\nskeletal elements are present, and the general contour of the body, the\r\ncharacter of the dermal covering, the color-markings, the lateral-line\r\nsystem, and many other features of interest have been detected. Such\r\ncompleteness of preservation is very uncommon even among the remains\r\nobtained from this locality. In this case the entire form was preserved,\r\nbut the collector, in cracking the nodule, lost the chips containing the\r\nfeet, so that only portions of the limbs remain. It is thus impossible to\r\ndetermine the phalangeal formula, but the feet were probably like those\r\nof _Branchiosaurus amblystomus_ Credner, as given by Credner, to which\r\nspecies the present form is closely allied and indeed must be placed in\r\nthe same family with _Branchiosaurus_, _Pelosaurus_, and _Melanerpeton_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                            PLATE 2\r\n\r\nDrawing × 3.5. of type specimen of _Micrerpeton caudatum_ Moodie, from the\r\nCoal Measures of Mazon Creek, Illinois, showing skeletal elements, form\r\nof head and tail, the lateral-line sense-organs, banded color-markings,\r\nand ventral scutellæ. On the edges of the tail impression are indications\r\nthat in life the tail had a thin fold of skin above and below the fleshy\r\nportion, much as in the larvæ of _Amblystoma_ at the present day.]\r\n\r\nThe remains here described represent a small, salamander-like form, and\r\nthey are among the earliest geological evidence of the group, which,\r\nwithout doubt, gave rise to the modern salamanders. The parts preserved\r\nin the specimen are: the complete outline of the head with most of the\r\ncranial elements clearly distinguishable, as well as the black pigment\r\nof the choroid; the entire vertebral column, including pits in the tail\r\nregion, where the vertebræ were without doubt entirely cartilaginous;\r\nparts of the pectoral girdle; the ilium; the left humerus; the ventral\r\nscutellation; the ribs of one side of the body and indications of ribs on\r\nthe other; portions of both hind limbs; and a complete impression of the\r\nfleshy tail. On this impression of the tail are preserved small, horny\r\nscales, transverse color-markings, and the distinct impressions of the\r\nlateral-line system.\r\n\r\nThe bones of _Micrerpeton caudatum_, as in so many of the fossils from\r\nthis locality, have been replaced by a white, friable mineral which is\r\nprobably kaolin. The animal is preserved on its back and it is thus\r\nillustrated from the ventral side. The entire length of the animal is only\r\n49 mm., of which the tail occupies nearly half.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Restoration of _Micrerpeton caudatum_, a\r\nbranchiosaur from the Coal Measures of Illinois. × 2.]\r\n\r\nThe head has much the same shape as in the species of Branchiosaurus\r\ndescribed and figured by Fritsch (251), Credner (181), and Thevenin (568).\r\nThe eyes occupy relatively the same position as in that genus. The orbits\r\nare very large and broadly oval. Within the borders of the rim the stone\r\nis blackened as though by the black pigment of the iris, such as Cope has\r\ndescribed in _Amphibamus_. Under a rather high power of magnification\r\nthe cranial bones are seen to be represented by mere flakes of white\r\nmineral matter. The sutures separating the cranial elements are distinctly\r\npreserved on the main half of the nodule.\r\n\r\nThe openings of the skull are five the two orbits, the two minute\r\nnostrils, and the pineal foramen. A median suture separates the skull\r\ninto halves and the pineal foramen lies slightly anterior to the\r\nposterior third of its length. The boundaries of the premaxillæ are not\r\ndistinct, but they are very small elements and form the inner border of\r\nthe nostrils, which are clearly indicated by bosses of stone. The nasal\r\nelement is nearly square and lies anterior to the frontal, which it\r\nborders broadly. The parietal is about the same size as the frontal and it\r\napparently forms a portion of the inner border of the orbit, although this\r\nis not assured. The parietal is elongate and unites posteriorly with the\r\npostparietal. The postparietal, with the tabulare and the squamosal, form\r\nthe posterior boundary of the skull, and they are hence not unlike the\r\nsame elements in other Stegocephala. The pref rental forms the anterior\r\nborder of the orbit. The lacrimal has not been detected. The maxilla\r\nis elongate and forms the antero-lateral border of the skull. The jugal\r\nforms an important element in the lateral border of the cranium and joins\r\nthe quadratojugal posteriorly. The postfrontal is triangular and with the\r\npostorbital forms the posterior border of the orbit. Both of the elements\r\nare acuminate posteriorly, although the suture between them is indistinct,\r\nand they inclose between their posterior acuminations an anterior\r\nprojection of the supratemporal. The squamosal has the usual relations and\r\nborders the supratemporal laterally. The latter element forms the quadrate\r\nangle of the cranium.\r\n\r\nThe entire length of the vertebral column is preserved, although\r\nthe nature and structure of its elements can not be determined. The\r\nimpressions of a few of the vertebræ show that some of the centra were\r\namphicœlous, but other than this nothing is definite. The cavities which\r\nthe centra occupied were filled by the white mineral matter and the force\r\nof the blow which cracked the nodule destroyed the form of the mold. It is\r\npossible that where the mineral matter has filled the cavities the centra\r\nwere osseous or partly cartilaginous, and where the cavities were unfilled\r\nthe centra were entirely cartilaginous. The length of the vertebral column\r\nfrom the base of the skull to the last impression of a cartilaginous\r\ncentrum is 33 mm.\r\n\r\nThe number of centra between the sacral vertebra and the skull is 20 as\r\nthey are preserved, but there may have been one more, the atlas. Fritsch\r\nhas represented 21 in his restoration of _Branchiosaurus salamandroides_,\r\nand this is a further indication of an affinity between the two genera,\r\nalthough Credner has represented 26 presacral vertebra; in _Branchiosaurus\r\namblystomus_. The presacral vertebræ are thus seen to vary within narrow\r\nlimits, but the number of presacrals is near 20, and this may be taken\r\nas typical. It is interesting to notice that in modern forms of the\r\nsalamanders the presacral vertebræ number about 20. There is but a single\r\nsacral centrum in _Micrerpeton_. The sacral rib has not been detected, but\r\nit is restored after the condition found in _Branchiosaurus_. The right\r\nfemur partially covers the sacral vertebra, and its structure can not be\r\ndetermined. I count impressions of 17 caudal centra, of which at least\r\n12 may have been partially ossified. In the cervical region there are\r\ndistinct impressions of transverse processes on at least 5 vertebræ, and\r\nthis number is assigned to the neck, although it is by no means certain\r\nthat this is the correct number. The neck was at least short, if we may\r\njudge from the position of the remains of the pectoral girdle. No cervical\r\nribs are definitely determined. There is a short rib lying between the\r\nfifth and sixth vertebræ, but to which it belongs is uncertain.\r\n\r\nThere are impressions of 10 ribs preserved on one side of the vertebral\r\ncolumn and one on the other side. They are short, straight, and heavy,\r\nas are the same elements in _Branchiosaurus_. This character alone is\r\nsufficient to place _Micrerpeton_ among the Branchiosauria, since no\r\nsuch ribs are known in other groups of the extinct amphibians. The ribs\r\npreserved lie next the seventh to the seventeenth vertebræ on the left\r\nside, and there is one on the right side which may belong to either the\r\nfifth or sixth vertebra. They are central in their attachment, and in this\r\nthey agree well with the mode of rib attachment in the modern salamanders.\r\nAll of the ribs are single-headed and are composed, for the most part,\r\nof perichondral tissue. The position of the ribs in the matrix inclined\r\nbackwards, and, making a small angle with the vertebral column, is very\r\nsuggestive of the condition in _Branchiosaurus_.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral girdle is represented by three distinct elements of the left\r\nside, which are identified as scapula, clavicle, and coracoid, following\r\nthe nomenclature given by Woodward (631), although Credner (186) would\r\nname them otherwise. The scapula is represented by an ovoid fragment\r\nlying next to the vertebral column. The clavicle was probably spatulate,\r\nas in _Melanerpeton_, but the inner end of the element is not visible.\r\nThe coracoid is represented by its outer end only, and its inner pointed\r\nextremity is not visible. The interclavicle has not been detected.\r\n\r\nThe humerus lies somewhat to one side of the pectoral girdle, as if\r\nthere had been a large amount of epiphyseal cartilage. Its position may\r\nbe due to post-mortem shifting, but there is little other evidence of\r\nany movement after deposition. The humerus is a large, heavy bone in\r\ncomparison with the rest of the skeleton. It is expanded at each end, and\r\nits ends show concavities, proving that the bone is formed principally\r\nof perichondral tissue, as would be expected from such an early\r\nBranchiosaurian. The endochondrium has not yet developed in this form,\r\nwhich is evidently adult. There is no other element of the arm present.\r\n\r\nThere is but a single element of the pelvis preserved, a slender elongate\r\nrod which is undoubtedly the ilium, since it has the usual position for\r\nthat element and is much too large for a sacral rib. It has much the same\r\nshape as the ilium in the modern _Salamandra_, and is not expanded as is\r\nthe ilium of _Branchiosaurus_. This element, like the humerus, seems to\r\nhave been but a hollow cylinder of bone and undoubtedly had cartilaginous\r\nends, as in the ilium of the recent _Salamandra_. The two femora are\r\npreserved nearly entire, the right one lying upon and partly obscuring the\r\nsacral vertebra. The femur is much more slender than is the humerus, with\r\nslightly expanded ends, and, like the humerus, shows the concavities at\r\nthe ends, indicative of the perichondral character of the tissue composing\r\nit. There are two elements of the leg preserved more or less entire. The\r\nlarger bone may represent the tibia and the smaller the fibula. They both\r\npresent characters similar to those of the femur and humerus. They are\r\nsimple rods of bone tapering at the distal end. The feet have been lost,\r\nthough doubtless they were present at one time.\r\n\r\nThe ventral surface of the body, as in other members of the\r\nBranchiosauria, was covered and protected by a series of small scutes\r\narranged in the regular chevron pattern. The form of the scutes and their\r\nnumber can not be determined. The lines which represent them are, however,\r\ndistinct. Some of the scutes are missing and some of them are obscured\r\nby lying over the vertebral column. They are all somewhat shifted to the\r\nleft. The lines are very small and close together. I count 16 of them\r\nin a distance of 2 mm. In length the longest line preserved is a little\r\nmore than 4 mm., measuring from the point of the chevron. The lines\r\nrepresenting the scutes come to a point in a median ridge which is now\r\nrepresented by a line. The dermal scutes on the abdomen were probably the\r\nforerunners of the abdominal ribs of the reptiles (fig. 9).\r\n\r\nThe impression of the tail contains some of the most interesting features\r\nin the entire specimen. Scattered over it and in places laid in mosaic\r\nare impressions of small dermal scales, which may have covered the\r\nentire body. In form the scales are ovoid, being half as wide as long,\r\nand the markings on the scales partake of the nature of radiating lines,\r\nmuch after the pattern of the sculpturing of the cranial bones in the\r\nMicrosauria. The scales are less than 0.5 mm. in diameter and their\r\ncharacter can only be ascertained under high magnification. Near the\r\nmiddle of the tail there are preserved distinct transverse bands of\r\ndark color, which are more or less evident throughout the entire tail\r\nimpression, but they are elsewhere not so distinct as in the central\r\nregion. The lines are evidently due to rows of pigmented scales, and in\r\nall probability the animal's body was transversely striped.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and important single structure discovered on the\r\nspecimen is the impression of the lateral-line system, which is clearly\r\nevident as two dark lines on the impression of the fleshy part of the\r\ntail. The sense-organs are represented by two longitudinal rows of\r\npigmented scales, one beginning at the tip of the tail, the other taking\r\nits origin from the median line somewhat further forward. I am indebted to\r\nDr. Katashi Takahashi for calling my attention to the similarity of this\r\narrangement to that found in the recent _Necturus_. The arrangement and\r\ndisposition of the lines containing the sense-organs is practically the\r\nsame in the two forms. The median lateral-line takes its origin from the\r\nextreme tip of the tail and is continued to the base, where the impression\r\nis broken. The dorsal lateral-line has its origin rather abruptly from the\r\nmedian lateral-line at a distance of 6 mm. from the tip of the tail. The\r\nsense-organs were undoubtedly located beneath specialized pigmented scales\r\non the surface, and to this pigment is due the preservation of the lines.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the arrangement of the sense-organs of _Micrerpeton_\r\ncorresponds so exactly to the condition found in _Necturus_ is of\r\nconsiderable interest. _Necturus_ alone among the modern tailed\r\nAmphibia has the arrangement described for the lateral-line system of\r\n_Micrerpeton_. All other forms of the Caudata, as also the larval forms\r\nof the Salientia, have an arrangement of the lateral-line system which\r\nis perfectly distinct from that found in Necturus, although the basis of\r\nthe same arrangement is found in all. In _Amblystoma_, for instance, the\r\nmedian lateral-line is not present on the tail, and the dorsal line is\r\nincompletely developed. The close similarity of the arrangement of the\r\nsystems of sense-organs in the two forms, _Micrerpeton_ and _Necturus_,\r\nmay be of genetic significance with regard to the latter form. The\r\nlateral-line sense-organs are of a very fundamental significance, and\r\nit is not at all improbable that the same arrangement of the lines has\r\nexisted from the Carboniferous period or earlier. We know that such\r\nhas been the case in a great many of the fishes. The ancestors of the\r\nmodern Caudata must have originated somewhere in the basal Carboniferous\r\nor earlier periods, and, in the writer's opinion, the Branchiosauria\r\nrepresent the ancestral group of the Caudata. This suggestion is by no\r\nmeans new, since Baur and others have held the same view. This topic has\r\nbeen discussed at length elsewhere (459) by the writer.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the form _Micrerpeton caudatum_ are readily determined.\r\nThe number of the presacral vertebræ, the form and position of the\r\nribs, the shape of the skull, the arrangement of the cranial elements,\r\nthe structure of the pectoral girdle and the character of the ventral\r\narmature all clearly bespeak a close relationship with _Branchiosaurus_,\r\n_Melanerpeton_, _Pelosaurus_, and other European branchiosaurian forms\r\nfrom the Upper Carboniferous and Lower Permian.\r\n\r\nThe above-described species, with others given below, is the earliest\r\ngeological evidence of the Branchiosauria, since the oldest European\r\nforms are from the Stephanian (Upper Carboniferous), which probably lies\r\nsomewhat above the horizon of the Allegheny series of North America. The\r\npresence of the Branchiosauria in America is of considerable interest in\r\nthe bearing it has on the distribution and migration of the Paleozoic\r\nanimals. Knowledge of how the group came to occur in such widely separated\r\nlocalities in approximately contemporary geological strata is an unsolved\r\nproblem of paleontology. It is possible that the piscian ancestors of the\r\nAmphibia migrated across or along the borders of the seas and began the\r\namphibian phase of development independently in the two continents. That\r\nevolution should, in this case, have followed almost exactly parallel\r\nlines seems incredible.\r\n\r\nMeasurements.\r\n\r\n                                    mm.\r\n  Length of entire animal           49\r\n  Length of head in median line      6.5\r\n  Width of head at posterior border  8\r\n  Length of orbit                    2.5\r\n  Width of orbit                     2\r\n  Interorbital space                 2\r\n  Length of the vertebral column    33\r\n  Length of the vertebral centrum\r\n    in dorsal series                 0.5\r\n  Length of trunk from base of\r\n    skull to sacrum                 22\r\n  Length of rib                      1.5\r\n  Length of scapula                  3\r\n  Maximum width of clavicle          2\r\n  Length of humerus                  2.5\r\n  Length of ilium                    1.5\r\n  Length of femur                    2\r\n  Length of tibia                    1.5\r\n  Length of tail impression         21.5\r\n  Width of tail impression at base   4\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus EUMICRERPETON Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Kans.

The three specimens will be discussed\r\nseparately, since they show different features.\r\n\r\nThe impression of the larger animal (No. 803, Yale University Museum),\r\nwhich is probably an adult, presents the following elements: the entire\r\nskull, both humeri, impressions of posterior and anterior ventral\r\narmature, portions of the alimentary canal, one femur, portions of a\r\nfibula and tibia, and the entire impression of the tail, on which, as in\r\n_Micrerpeton caudatum_, there occur two definite dark lines, one beginning\r\nat the tip of the tail and running obliquely along the tail to where the\r\nimpression is broken at the anal region; the other beginning at a distance\r\nof 4.5 mm. from the tip and running almost parallel with the median line.\r\nThese two lines undoubtedly represent the lateral-line system.\r\n\r\nThe skull is especially noted for its shortness and the great posterior\r\nwidth, as well as for the almost entire absence of the tympanic notch.\r\nThe pineal foramen is located on a line with the posterior border of the\r\norbits. The eyes themselves are narrow and acuminate at each end, with a\r\npronounced convexity inwards and a flattening on the outer margin. They\r\nare located on the very border of the skull, but relatively more posterior\r\nthan in _Micrerpeton_. No sclerotic plates are evident. The median suture\r\ncan be indistinctly observed running the entire length of the skull. The\r\nsutures bounding the outside of the f rentals and the squamosals are\r\npartially evident, but not satisfactorily preserved. The mandible is\r\nrepresented by a mold which in wax impression shows short, stumpy teeth.\r\n\r\nPosterior to the skull at a distance of a millimeter there are two sharp\r\nimpressions which may represent the anterior edges of the interclavicle\r\nor they may be branchial elements. They are distinctly curved, however,\r\nand probably represent portions of the interclavicle. A wax impression\r\ndoes not show a discrete structure, but the boundaries of some larger\r\nelement. No other remains of the pectoral girdle can be discerned. The\r\nhumeri are short and relatively thick. Wax impressions show them to have\r\nhad truncate or slightly concave ends, thus indicating the absence or\r\nslight development of the endochondrium. No other elements of the arm are\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThe impression of an elongate femur and the heads of the tibia and fibula\r\nof the left side are preserved.\r\n\r\nThe ventral armature is preserved in two small patches, and these show\r\nthe chevron-shaped rods to have been very fine much more delicate than in\r\n_Micrerpeton_.\r\n\r\nThe body impression is very instructive and interesting, both in showing\r\nthe form of the body and because in it are preserved the larger portions\r\nof the alimentary canal. The form of the body can best be discerned by\r\nreference to the figures (plate 3, figs. 1 and 2; plate 5, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe portions of the alimentary canal preserved consist of the greater\r\nportion of the stomach, three coils or loops of the small intestine, the\r\nrectum, and a pit which undoubtedly represents the anal opening. The anus\r\nis found at a distance of 16 mm. from the tip of the tail and is somewhat\r\nremoved from the body portion, as in modern salamanders. On each side of\r\nthe posterior end of the rectum there occur a pair of enlargements which\r\nprobably represent the oviducts at their posterior ends (fig. 15, C).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                            PLATE 3\r\n\r\n  1.

The two humeri and the\r\nfemur of the left side are preserved and the interclavicle is represented\r\nby an identical impression, as in the first-described specimen. The tail\r\nimpression, though similar in form, does not exhibit so much of the\r\nstructure of the lateral lines (fig. 15, B).\r\n\r\nThe matter of especial interest in connection with this second specimen\r\nis the remarkably perfect preservation of the alimentary canal, which is\r\nentire, except for the very anterior end of the œsophagus. The posterior\r\nportion of the œsophagus, which measures 3.5 mm., is clearly preserved.\r\nIts anterior end is thrown around posteriorly and indicates that this\r\nend was loosened after death and became displaced before fossilization.\r\nThe length preserved may represent the entire œsophagus. The œsophagus\r\nis constricted before it enters the stomach, which shows the usual\r\ncurvature found in modern salamanders. The stomach measures 6 mm. in\r\nlength by 2 mm. in breadth, and consists of a single enlargement as in\r\nthe modern _Amblystoma punctatum_. It increases in size somewhat toward\r\nthe pyloric end and then very gradually constricts to the pylorus. Three\r\ndivisions of the small intestine can be seen. The most anterior one,\r\ncorresponding to the duodenum, is segmented, as though the intestine had\r\nbeen filled with food before interment. The remainder of the intestine,\r\ncorresponding to the ilium, is looped in the form of two figures =8= which\r\nare superimposed, with the upper portions of the =8= at right angles to\r\neach other. The rectum is clearly discernible, though its lower portion\r\nis somewhat obscured by having the lower part of the upper loop of the\r\nintestine lying over it. The anus lies at a distance of 1.5 mm. posterior\r\nto the transverse line from, the upper end of the femur, and is quite well\r\nback on the tail, as in modern salamanders. In this specimen also occur\r\ntwo oval bodies which may be identified as the lower ends of the oviducts,\r\nthus indicating, in all probability, that the animal was a female.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.

Original in\r\n       United States National Museum. × 2 (For description see P. 132.)\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nA dissection of several species of modern caudates has resulted in\r\nthe discovery that the adult condition of the alimentary canal of all\r\nthe species dissected (_Amblystoma punctatum_, _Necturus maculosus_,\r\n_Diemyctylits torosus_, _D. viridescens_, etc.) is much more complex than\r\nthat exhibited by the specimen under discussion. A very near approach to\r\nthe condition found in _Eumicrerpeton parvum_ is found in an immature\r\nbranchiate individual of _Diemyctylits torosus_, 56 mm. in length, from\r\na fresh-water pond on Mount Constitution, on Orcas Island, Puget Sound,\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe similarity of the intestinal structure is of considerable importance\r\nto our understanding of the relationship existing between the\r\nCarboniferous Branchiosauria and the modern Caudata, and only confirms\r\nother arguments, offered in another place (459), concerning their\r\nimmediate relationship.\r\n\r\nThe branchiosaurian affinities of the present species are almost too\r\nevident to need discussion. The entire structure is essentially similar to\r\nthat of other genera of the order.\r\n\r\nThe third specimen of this species (No. 4400 of the U. S. National Museum)\r\nis almost as perfectly preserved as were the other two specimens. The\r\nskull structure, the intermediate position of the pineal foramen, the\r\nepiotic notch, and the shape of the skull are essentially similar to the\r\ndescribed specimens of the species. The present specimen is more developed\r\nthan the other two and probably represents an adult. The alimentary canal\r\nis perfectly preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly half again as long as the smallest of the above-described\r\nspecimens, and the skull is proportionately longer and wider. There is\r\npreserved also an impression of the anterior ends of both clavicles. The\r\nright humerus is imperfectly preserved, as is also the right femur and\r\ntibia; other than these the fossil is merely an impression.\r\n\r\nThe skull is so similar to those described above that additional\r\ndescription is unnecessary. The pineal foramen is quite large and lies\r\non a line which cuts the orbits into equal longitudinal parts. The\r\ninterorbital space is about equal to the long diameter of the orbit.\r\nTraces of sclerotic plates are observed in the left orbit, but they are\r\nquite imperfect.\r\n\r\nThe alimentary canal (fig. 14_a_) is unlike the previously described\r\nstructures, in that the intestine is longer and more convoluted. It\r\nlies in five longitudinal folds and ends in an enlarged cloaca, near\r\nwhich there are impressions of two glands, or the posterior ends of\r\nthe oviducts, as was suggested for the Yale specimens. The creatures\r\nundoubtedly fed on small plants and animals much as do the recent\r\nsalamanders.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of Eumicrerpeton parvum Moodie.\r\n\r\n  No. 803 (222), Yale University Museum:          mm.\r\n    Length of animal                             37.5\r\n    Length of skull                               4.5\r\n    Posterior width of skull at table             6\r\n    Long diameter of eye                          1.75\r\n    Transverse diameter of eye                   65\r\n    Length of left humerus                        1.50\r\n    Number of ventral armature rods in 1 mm      10\r\n    Length of femur                               1.75\r\n    Width across base of tail impression          3.5\r\n    Length of tail from base to tip              17\r\n\r\n  No. 802 (471) Yale University Museum:           mm.\r\n    Length of animal                             30\r\n    Length of skull                               4\r\n    Posterior width of skull                      5\r\n    Length of œsophagus                        3.5\r\n    Length of stomach                             6\r\n    Width of stomach                              1.33\r\n    Estimated length of intestine                18\r\n    Width across base of tail impression          2.5\r\n    Length of tail from base to tip               7\r\n\r\n  No. 4400, U.

Univ. Sci. Bull., vol. VI, No. 2, p. 336, 1912.\r\n\r\nType: _M. longicaudatum_ Moodie.\r\n\r\nThe genus is distinguished from other known branchiosaurian genera by\r\nthe great length of the dorsal region, the elongate tail (plate 5, fig.\r\n2), with its well-developed caudal ribs, the reduction of the tympanic\r\nnotch, the broad nature of the scapula, the elongate interclavicle, and\r\nthe slender ilium. The number of dorsal vertebræ is identical with that of\r\n_Branchiosaurus_ of Saxony.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mazonerpeton longicaudatum Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Kans. Univ. Sci. Bull., VI, No. 2, p. 337, pl. 3, figs. 1-2; pl. 7,\r\n    fig. 3; pl. 10. 1912.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 795 (1234), Yale University Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Mazon Creek shales, near Morris, Illinois. (Plate 3,\r\nfigs. 5 and 6.)\r\n\r\nThe remains consist of the following elements: an incomplete skull; nearly\r\nthe entire vertebral column, consisting of cervical, dorsal, sacral, and\r\ncaudal vertebræ, 36 in number; several ribs preserved on each side of\r\nthe vertebral column; a portion of the ventral armature; the scapulæ; a\r\nclavicle; the interclavicle; both humeri; the radius and ulna of one side\r\nand the ulna of the other; portions of both hands; the ilium of the right\r\nside; both femora, and a partial impression of the left tibia.\r\n\r\nThe skull is, unfortunately, very poorly preserved. Enough remains,\r\nhowever, to determine the essential characters. The skull bones, unlike\r\nany other American branchiosaurian, have an ornamentation consisting of\r\nsharp pits and elevations which in places have a quincuncial arrangement\r\nand in others take the form of definite lines of pits or tubercles similar\r\nto the condition found in many of the Microsauria. The orbits are large\r\nand are situated back of the median transverse line of the skull. They\r\nare almost circular in form and contain 6 elongated sclerotic plates very\r\nclosely arranged around the borders of the right orbit. The plates are\r\ntwice as long as wide. The interorbital width is 1.25 times the transverse\r\ndiameter of the orbit.\r\n\r\nNot many of the sutures of the skull are discernible. Portions of\r\nthe frontals, the nasals, the prefrontals, the parietals, and the\r\nsupratemporals can be identified. Their arrangement is shown in figure\r\n14_a_. There is a decided posterior table to the skull, with truncate\r\nposterior border. The tympanic notch is shallow, with its outer border not\r\nso well protected as in _Branchiosaurus_.\r\n\r\nThe cervical vertebræ are incomplete, but their number was 4 or 5, as in\r\n_Micrerpeton_. The structure of the dorsal vertebræ is also uncertain,\r\nalthough the shape can be discerned. The vertebræ are short and thick,\r\nvery unlike the long, cylindrical vertebræ of _Cephalerpeton_. The heavy\r\ntransverse process is quite evident on the best preserved vertebræ. This\r\nprocess recalls that described by Credner for the Saxony Branchiosauria.\r\nSeveral of the vertebræ show the articulation of the ribs with this\r\nprocess. The ribs of the caudal region recall very strongly those of\r\n_Branchiosaurus_. They are quite heavy in the anterior caudal region and\r\nthen diminish rather rapidly to the point where the tail is broken and\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe ventral armature is represented by a patch of chevron rods 21 mm. in\r\nlength. The rods take a very peculiar form, being short crescentic bundles\r\nof fine rods, hair-like in appearance. In one of these bundles I count 5\r\nsmaller rods. The bundles are arranged in rows similar to the pattern so\r\ncharacteristic of the Carboniferous Amphibia, as described elsewhere. The\r\npatch of ventral armature preserved belongs to the abdominal region. A\r\nsingle row of the crescentic bundles measures 11 mm.\r\n\r\nBoth scapulæ are preserved in their entire form. They are quite different\r\nfrom those of any other genus, being broadly crescentic with a posterior\r\nconcavity and an anterior protuberance. The anterior surface of both\r\nscapulæ is obscured. Vascular foramina occur near the base of both\r\nscapulæ; there being three of them in the right scapula, arranged in\r\nthe form of an isosceles triangle. The morphology of these foramina is\r\nuncertain. They have never been observed among the Carboniferous Amphibia,\r\nand, so far as I am aware, they are entirely unknown among higher\r\nvertebrates.\r\n\r\nThe temnospondylous Amphibia of the Carboniferous and Permian possess, in\r\nthe coössified scapula-coracoid, three foramina, very similar to the ones\r\nin the present form, but they are confined to the coracoidal region and,\r\nin the Branchiosauria, as identified by Credner, the coracoid is a free\r\nelement, although I have never been sure of its identity among American\r\nforms. Williston has called these foramina the glenoid, the supraglenoid,\r\nand the supracoracoid foramina (Journal Geology, XVII, No. 7). They are\r\nnot, however, to be correlated with the three foramina above mentioned,\r\nsince in the Temnospondylia the foramina belong with the coracoid and not\r\nwith the scapula. The condition of the Temnospondylia occurs in the bony\r\nfish _Xiphactinus audax_ Leidy, and an analogous condition obtains in the\r\nreptiles, as in the Mosasaurs and Dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14_a_.

From\r\nMazon Creek. Original in Yale University Museum.]\r\n\r\nNear the outer edge of the right scapula there is a large fragment\r\npreserved, which, I think, must be the misplaced clavicle. It is obscurely\r\ntriangular or, more exactly, spatulate. The interclavicle is represented\r\nby fragments only, and seems to have had a narrow form.\r\n\r\nThe humeri recall those of _Micrerpeton_. They are somewhat elongate\r\nand apparently cylindrical in their normal condition, although somewhat\r\nflattened in the fossil. The shaft is considerably constricted at the\r\nmiddle and the ends are expanded, in which expansion the lower end\r\nexceeds. The ends are abruptly truncate, indicating a small amount of\r\nendochondral ossification or its entire absence.\r\n\r\nThe mesopodial elements, unlike what is described for _Cephalerpeton_,\r\nare quite dissimilar in form, recalling the condition in _Mesosaurus\r\nbrasiliensis_ McGregor. The larger element is, apparently, the ulna.\r\nIt has the lower end greatly expanded and the shaft is curved outward,\r\nresembling very much a reptilian ulna. The radius is much smaller than the\r\nulna, lacks the lower expansion, and is shorter by 1 mm.\r\n\r\nThe carpus is represented merely by a blank space, with evidences of\r\nimpressions of cartilage in the sandstone. The hand of the right side\r\ncontains 4 phalanges. There are 2 phalanges preserved in the first digit,\r\nincluding a sharp-pointed terminal phalanx, and the second digit has only\r\nthe metacarpal. The third has the metacarpal and the first phalanx, which\r\ndoes not differ in form, but only in size, from the metacarpal. The fourth\r\ndigit contains only the metacarpal. Of the left hand there are portions\r\nof 3 digits preserved, including 3 metacarpals and a phalanx, which in\r\nstructure are not different from those of the right hand.\r\n\r\nThe ilium of the left side is preserved, apparently entire. It is elongate\r\nand cylindrical, its upper end adjoining the twenty-eighth vertebra.\r\nThe head of the femur lies close to the lower end of the ilium, so that\r\nthat element must have been suspended in the flesh, much as in modern\r\nsalamanders. It could not have been of much use as a support for the\r\nbody. The form of the femur is not unlike that described for the humerus,\r\nsave that its lower end is smaller than the upper, while in the humerus\r\nthe extremities are of equal diameter.

Univ. Sci. Bull., VI, No. 2, p. 341, pl. 2, fig. 3; pl.\r\n    8, fig. 4; pl. 9, fig. 2; pl. 10. 1912.\r\n\r\nThe remains on which the present species is based are inclosed in a much\r\nfractured nodule. The parts of the animal which have been identified\r\nare: a part of the skull and left mandible, two clavicles, a humerus,\r\nimpressions of several vertebræ, a portion of the dorsal region of the\r\nbody with several ribs, two portions of the caudal region with several\r\nribs and unidentified fragments. (Plate 4, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe animal, from the shape and form of the ribs, is undoubtedly a\r\nbranchiosaurian, since short, heavy, straight ribs have not yet been\r\nfound to be associated with other than branchiosaurian structures. It\r\nis placed in the genus Mazonerpeton on account of the structure of the\r\npectoral elements, the form of the humerus, and the length of the tail,\r\nall of which agree in structure with _Mazonerpeton longicaudatum_. The\r\nanimal attained, perhaps, a length of 4.5 inches, while that of _M.\r\nlongicaudatum_ was about 3 inches. The tail in the present species is very\r\nlong and slender, more elongate than in any other known branchiosaurian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14_b_.

Three sutures can be observed, but what sutures\r\nthey are is undetermined. The left mandible lies crushed on the edge of\r\nthe skull and partially obscures what little there is of that structure.\r\nThe slightly curved impression, from which the bone has been either broken\r\nor weathered, measures 13 mm. in length by 3 mm. in posterior diameter by\r\n1 mm. in anterior diameter. These measurements show the element to have\r\nbeen slender and pointed anteriorly.\r\n\r\nVery little accurate information can be derived from the study of the\r\nvertebral column of the specimen, nor can the dorsal vertebral formula\r\nbe made out, since only a portion of the length of that region is\r\npreserved and only a few rather indefinite impressions can be discerned.\r\nThese impressions show the vertebræ to be short and higher than in most\r\nBranchiosauria.\r\n\r\nThe caudal series is represented by two sections, one of which is,\r\napparently, from near the base of the tail, judging from the size of the\r\ncaudal ribs preserved; the other is from near the tip of the tail, and\r\nshows the constituents to have been long and slender. Ribs are apparently\r\nabsent on this section. The position of the two caudal sections shows\r\nthat when the animal died it was coiled up much like a snake, so that in\r\nthe fractured nodule three sections of the body are visible. The tail was\r\nprobably half as long again as the body.\r\n\r\nThe ribs throughout the body are short, heavy, and straight, with, in\r\nthe dorsal series, a lateral and a distal expansion which is taken as a\r\ndistinctive specific character. Judging from imperfect impressions in\r\nthe dorsal series, the ribs were attached to a transverse process of the\r\ncentrum, thus agreeing with other branchiosaurians in this respect. The\r\nribs show a progressive decrease in length from the cervical region to the\r\npoint of their disappearance on the tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                            PLATE 5\r\n\r\n  1.

The\r\n       lateral-line organs are represented as dark bands on the tail,\r\n       the sense-organs being, apparently, situated beneath specialized\r\n       pigmented scales, to which is due the preservation of the lines.\r\n\r\n  2. A restoration, natural size, of the branchiosaurian,\r\n       _Mazonerpeton_, based on two specimens. The form of the animal\r\n       is quite salamander-like. It is shown when about to feed on a\r\n       specimen of _Acanthotelson stimpsoni_, which is said to be a\r\n       brackish-water crustacean. The branchiosaur and crustacean may\r\n       possibly have inhabited the same body of water.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe pectoral girdle is represented by two elements, one of which is\r\ncertainly the right clavicle, and the other is possibly the left clavicle,\r\nthough its form is somewhat distorted by pressure. Both elements are in\r\nthe form of an elongate spatula with the dorsal surface greatly concave\r\nand the inner end acuminate.\r\n\r\nThe right humerus is imperfectly preserved, though the impression allows\r\none to gain an exact idea of its form. It lies under the right clavicle.\r\nIts ends are truncate with a contracted shaft and expanded extremities;\r\nthe bone was apparently hollow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.\r\n\r\n  A.

W. Dawson in the coal formation at the South Joggins,\r\nNova Scotia. Nothing has been collected since that date that would give\r\nadditional information as to the nature of the form represented. I give\r\nhere Dawson's description of the remains:\r\n\r\n\"In the coaly matter or mineral charcoal at the base of tree No. 10\r\nappeared a few fragments of an animal which may possibly belong to the\r\nabove-named genus of Fritsch, though I am by no means certain of this\r\nidentification or of the real nature of the animal.\r\n\r\n\"The skull is represented by a fragment of a maxillary or intermaxillary\r\nbone, with blunt conical teeth. It is smooth or marked merely with\r\nmicroscopic dots. There is also a fragment which may be a palatal bone\r\nstudded with minute teeth.\r\n\r\n\"A few vertebræ associated with the above bones are long and narrow, with\r\nlarge zygapophyses and long neural spines. Length of body (i.e., of the\r\nvertebra) about 3 millimeters.\r\n\r\n\"With these remains are a few bony scales different from those of any\r\nother species found in these trees, and more resembling scales of Ganoid\r\nFishes. They are somewhat rectangular in form, enameled on the surface and\r\nbeautifully sculptured with waving lines.\r\n\r\n\"In the same trunk were found some teeth and bones referable to\r\n_Hylerpeton dawsoni_, and it is not impossible that the remains above\r\nreferred to may have belonged to some creature devoured by that animal,\r\nand which would not otherwise have obtained admission to the interior of\r\nan erect tree. The tree itself had been removed by the sea, all but a\r\nlittle of the base, and this was in a very unsatisfactory state, so that\r\ndoubt might even exist as to the limit between the deposit in the interior\r\nof the tree and that under its base.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15_a_.

COAL MEASURES TO RECENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Naked-skinned, elongate, tailed salamanders, mud-puppies, efts, newts,\r\n  etc. External gills present or absent in adult condition, but always\r\n  present in young. Limbs short, with usually 4 digits on hand and 5 on\r\n  foot, but this is subject to much difference. Limbs never very stout.\r\n  Carpus and tarsus cartilaginous. Skull roof without the postparietal,\r\n  postorbital, and supratemporal. Skull elements never ornamented and\r\n  never cut by the lateral-line canals. Vertebræ consisting of a single\r\n  element; ribs short, attached to an elongate transverse process.\r\n  Caudal ribs seldom present. Parietal foramen lacking. No ventral\r\n  armature. Fresh-water inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Suborder PROTEIDA Cope, 1868.=\r\n\r\nThis order agrees generally with the Caudata, but presents one most\r\nimportant feature of difference in the presence of the opisthotic. It is\r\nthis point which gives the Proteida its intermediate position between\r\nthe extinct amphibians and the recent species, and seems to indicate a\r\nconnecting line from the Coal Measures down to the present. The structure\r\nof the hyobranchial arches sustains this view.\r\n\r\nThe hyoid apparatus differs from that of other adult Caudata and resembles\r\nthat of their larvæ in having three epibranchials, instead of one only.\r\nThe second basibranchial is also connected with the first, which is\r\nnot the case with the other Caudata. Three extinct genera are placed\r\ntentatively in this suborder.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Family COCYTINIDÆ Cope, 1875.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 1, p. 12, 1875.\r\n\r\nThe present family, as here defined, includes the forms whose structure\r\nseems to ally them with the modern salamanders. The character on which\r\nmost dependence is placed is that of the branchial apparatus, lacking\r\nin _Hyphasma_. The forms are all incompletely known and the family will\r\ndoubtless require revision on acquisition of additional material. Three\r\ngenera, each with a single species, are:\r\n\r\n  _Cocytinus gyrinoides_ Cope. Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures. Based on the\r\n  ventral impression of the skull, with the well-developed branchial\r\n  apparatus.\r\n\r\n  _Erierpeton branchialis_ Moodie. Mazon Creek, Illinois, shales. Based\r\n  on impression of mandibles and branchial apparatus.\r\n\r\n  _Hyphasma lævis_ Cope. Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures. Based on\r\n  incomplete and obscure amphibian body, lacking limbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus COCYTINUS Cope, 1871.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc. Am. Phil. Soc., 1871, 177.\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol. Surv. Ohio, II, pt. II, 360, 1875.\r\n\r\nType: Cocytinus gyrinoides Cope.\r\n\r\nVertebræ and ribs osseous; teeth on the premaxillary bone, none on the\r\nmaxillary; hyoid elements largely developed, an axialhyal with basihyal\r\non each side, closely united with the corresponding ceratohyal, at the\r\nend of which is an element in the position of a stylohyal; hæmal or\r\nbasibranchials 3, the anterior 2, each supporting i pleural branchihyal,\r\nand the third supporting one also, the first hæmal branchihyal on the\r\ninner side of the ceratohyal, approaching the median line, and with\r\nelongate pleural element.\r\n\r\nThe reference by Cope of this genus to the Caudata is one of the most\r\ninteresting facts connected with the Paleozoic Amphibia. He says: \"The\r\npresent genus is, then, to be referred to the neighborhood of _Amphiuma_\r\nand _Protonopsis_, but forming the type of another family\" (123). He\r\nregards the branchial apparatus as being more fish-like than that of any\r\nof the modern genera. It is possible that _Cocytinus gyrinoides_ was a\r\nlarval branchiate and consequently aquatic form. It should be more fully\r\ncompared with _Erierpeton branchialis_ from the Mazon Creek shales when\r\nbetter known, as well as with _Hyphasma lævis_ from the Linton locality.\r\n\r\nAll three of these forms are included, provisionally, under the Cocytinidæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cocytinus gyrinoides Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc.

Mus. Nat. Hist.). The type specimen consists\r\nof the inferior bones of the cranium in a fairly complete state of\r\npreservation, with the muzzle and its teeth; also 8 anterior vertebræ,\r\nwith their short recurved ribs.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the hyal elements in the type specimen is as follows: the\r\nhæmal elements of the first branchial arch are partially concealed on both\r\nsides of the ceratohyal. An expanded truncate face for attachment to the\r\naxial element is visible on both sides, but the body of the bone is flat\r\nand presents the edge of the specimen.\r\n\r\nThe first pleural element proceeds from just behind the axialhyal; it\r\nis longer than the other pleural elements. A slender bone is visible\r\nextending from the space between the ceratohyal and mandibular angle;\r\nit may, therefore, pertain to the suspensorium of the jaw as well as to\r\nthat of the hyiod arch, or be squamosal as well as stylohyal. The second\r\nhæmal bone is slender, but with an enlarged axial extremity; that of the\r\nright side is not so well preserved as to be safely determined. The third\r\nhæmal elements are the smallest, and originate immediately in front of the\r\noccipital condyles and diverge outwards and backwards. They are little\r\ncurved, subcylindric, and slightly expanded at the extremities.\r\n\r\nOf the pleural elements the first and second are little curved and the\r\nfirst is marked by a pit or foramen on the under side near the distal end,\r\nwhich is clearly visible on both sides of the specimen. The third and\r\nfourth pleurals are more curved and the outer ends slightly expanded and\r\ndirected backwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                            PLATE 6\r\n\r\n_Dendrerpeton acadianum_ Owen.

The second hæmal\r\nbranchihyal is dilated, fan-shaped distally, and supports two pleural\r\nelements. The muzzle projects over the lower jaw and was rather broadly\r\ntruncate. The premaxillary teeth are cylindric and 6 in number on each\r\nside. The maxillary bone is represented by a lamina at each lateral\r\nextremity of the premaxillary. The mandibular rami are very stout, as\r\nare also the ceratohyals. The vertebræ have possessed some apophyses,\r\napparently keel-shaped diapophyses.

There are a few hyal\r\nelements preserved, but nothing is added to our previous knowledge. The\r\nribs are quite as in the type specimen, as are also the vertebræ. The\r\nanimal was apparently a slender, eel-shaped amphibian comparing favorably\r\nwith the modern _Amphiuma_ in this respect.

I, 1912.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 801 (222) 5, Yale University, Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Mazon Creek shales, near Morris, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe amphibian remains designated by the above name consist of a distinct\r\nmandible and some rather indefinite body impressions (plate 3, fig.\r\n4). Three elongate impressions occur between the rami of the mandibles\r\n(fig. 15, A), which, I suppose, must represent hyoid bones belonging to\r\nthe hyobranchial arches. The lateral elements are paired and the median\r\nimpression is straight and lies between the paired impressions of the\r\nhyoids. The paired portions probably represent the hypohyals or hypohyals\r\nplus the ceratohyals, and the unpaired portion of the first basibranchial,\r\naccording to the nomenclature of Wiedersheim (Comparative Anatomy of\r\nVertebrates, 1897, p. 86). If the impressions have been correctly\r\ninterpreted the present specimen is of very great interest, since it is\r\nthe first evidence we have of the hyobranchial arches in the Amphibia\r\nof Mazon Creek, and the second in the Carboniferous of North America.\r\nDawson doubtfully identified (216) some elements of the Joggins Amphibia\r\nas hyoids, but was uncertain as to their position. Cope described fully\r\nthe well-developed hyobranchial apparatus of _Cocytinus gyrinoides_ (123)\r\nfrom the Coal Measures of Ohio. Among other Paleozoic Amphibia Williston\r\n(614) has described branchial arches in the peculiar form _Lysorophus\r\ntricarinatus_ Cope, from the Permian of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe form of the impression of the mandible in the present specimen is\r\nunlike anything known to the writer among other Carboniferous or later\r\nAmphibia. The rami are long, slender, deep, slightly curved, and pointed\r\nanteriorly. The anterior symphysis was not a complete sutural union, but\r\nwas occupied partly by cartilage or other connective tissue.\r\n\r\nThere are no definite traces of the appendicular skeleton. The traces of\r\nthe body (fig. 15, A) indicate an elongated, rather slender animal, but\r\nfurther than this nothing can be said in regard to its structure.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of a typically caudate form in the Carboniferous is\r\nunusual and complicates still further our understanding of the origin and\r\nrelationships of the early Amphibia.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type.\r\n\r\n                                           mm.\r\n  Length of entire impression              50\r\n  Length of mandible along median line     10\r\n  Width of mandibular ramus                 9\r\n  Length of basibranchial                   2.5\r\n  Width of basibranchial                    0.75\r\n  Length of hypohyal                        2.4\r\n  Width of hypohyal                         1.5\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus HYPHASMA Cope, 1875.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc.

The skull appears totally distinct from any known\r\nspecies of _Ptyonius_, but it is very imperfect. The condition of the\r\npectoral elements is very uncertain and I can not be sure that what Cope\r\ndescribed as thoracic \"scuta\" are such.

Caudal vertebræ coalesced into a slender elongate piece, the\r\n  urostyle. Two elements of the tarsus ossified and greatly elongated.\r\n  Development by metamorphosis; gills never present in adult. Ilium\r\n  greatly elongated.\r\n\r\nThe order is suggested in the Coal Measures by a single species, known\r\nfrom a single poorly preserved specimen (plate 24, fig. 1). The form\r\n_Pelion lyelli_ Wyman was the first known of the Linton Amphibia, and\r\nits striking frog-like (123, 639) appearance was early noticed. There\r\nis no assurance that the species belongs with this order, but since a\r\nwell-developed and highly specialized frog (480, 481) occurs in the Como\r\nBeds (405) of Wyoming, it is not impossible that we may have in the\r\n_Pelion lyelli_ a suggestion (460), at least, of the ancestral structure.\r\nIt is certain that the frogs have, in past ages, had a much greater length\r\nof vertebral column than they possess at present, as is witnessed by the\r\ncoalescence of several vertebræ to form the urostyle. It is suggested that\r\nthe ancestral vertebral column is represented in _Pelion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Family PELIONTIDÆ Cope, 1875.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 1, p. II, 1875.\r\n\r\nThe present family includes but a single species, that of _Pelion lyelli_\r\nWyman, first described in 1858 (640), from Linton, Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe family characters are to be found in the broad and obtusely rounded\r\ncranium, in the frog-like scapular arch, the frog-like hind limb, and in\r\nthe form of the palate, so far as these structures have been preserved.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the present form shows decided affinities with\r\nthe frogs of to-day and it may possibly be looked upon as the actual\r\nancestor of the living frogs. The length of the vertebral column would\r\nseem to militate against such a relationship, since it is well known\r\nthat frogs have had a short vertebral column since the Jurassic (480,\r\n481). But this is not a good argument, since the developing urostyles of\r\nmodern tadpoles show metameric fenestrations in the developing bone which\r\ndoubtless correspond to openings between the vertebræ. The notochord\r\nof the tail is segmented, apparently through the influence of former\r\nvertebral structure. At any rate, the suggestion is an interesting one\r\nand, whether sustained or disproven, the present discussion is based on\r\nthe probabilities of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus PELION Wyman, 1868.=\r\n\r\n  Wyman, Am.

(Plate 24, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThis was the first species described from the Linton, Ohio, deposits.\r\nIt was made known by Dr. Wyman in 1857 at the meeting of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science for that year. The species was\r\nsubsequently studied by Cope. He merely confirmed Wyman's observations.\r\nThe following description is based on the descriptions of Cope and Wyman\r\nand on my own study of the type specimen.\r\n\r\nThis is the most frog-like, in appearance at least, of all the Amphibia\r\nwhich have so far been discovered in the Carboniferous. The skull\r\nespecially has a shape which is strikingly frog-like, and the long hind\r\nlimbs lend further likeness to the tailless forms. _Pelion_ may have\r\nbeen a jumping creature, if we may judge from its long hind legs. Wyman\r\nand Cope have both called attention to the frog-like appearance of the\r\nspecimen, and this is apparent at the first glance. It is probable that\r\nthe resemblance has some significance as to the ancestry of the Salientia,\r\nand it may indicate the first step in the origin of the tailless Amphibia.\r\nIt is possible that the frogs began to be separated from the other\r\nAmphibia during the Carboniferous. The first frogs we know are from the\r\nJurassic, where they are well-developed ranids. If _Pelion_ be a frog\r\nancestor, then the history of the group from the Coal Measures to Jurassic\r\nis an unknown story.\r\n\r\nThe specimen is preserved on its back and it is thus impossible to tell as\r\nto the structure of the skull. Cope was of the opinion that the depressed\r\nareas on the sides of the elongate parasphenoid were the orbits, and if\r\nso the resemblance to the frogs is much more striking. In the frogs there\r\nis a strong process from the pterygoid which projects inward to meet a\r\ncorresponding process from the parasphenoid. This forms a heavy rod behind\r\nthe palatine vacuity. There is a heavy rod represented in the specimen and\r\na part of it is certainly the external process of the parasphenoid, but\r\nwhether it is to be interpreted as in the frog is an open question. The\r\noutline of the cranium is partially obscured by the mandibles, but the\r\nanterior part is represented by a raised line, as shown in figure 17. In\r\nthe anterior part of this space there are two ridges which may be tooth\r\nridges. If they are teeth there is a great similarity to the premaxillary\r\nand vomerine teeth of _Necturus_, since the ridges are widely separated\r\nat the median line and approximated distally, as they are in _Necturus_.\r\nThe mandible is preserved entire and its form is strikingly frog-like. Its\r\nposterior angles project over the quadrate area and seem to have had an\r\nupturned projection such as is found in the mandibles of the Crocodilia.\r\n\r\nThere are impressions of 20 vertebræ preserved, and they cover a little\r\nmore than half of the presacral region. There may have been 28 to 30\r\npresacrals. The vertebræ, as preserved, are somewhat quadrate in outline\r\nand constricted at the middle, as though they were of the typical\r\nmicrosaurian type. No ribs are preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. _Pelion lyelli_ Wyman, an amphibian from the\r\nCoal Measures of Ohio, the supposed ancestral salientian.

The pelvic girdle is entirely wanting in the specimen. Remains\r\nof the fore and hind limbs are preserved. The arms are especially well\r\npreserved and consist of a strong humerus, a separate radius and ulna, and\r\nphalanges, the carpus having undoubtedly been cartilaginous, since there\r\nare no traces of carpal bones. Wyman has figured a small ossicle (fig. 17)\r\nwhich might be interpreted as a carpal, but it is further removed from the\r\ncarpal region than his figure shows and I would interpret it as a fragment\r\nof a phalange, since the first digit seems to be turned aside over the\r\nvertebral column. The right hand is but imperfectly preserved, but the\r\nleft hand is nearly entire. There are evidences of 4 digits, possibly 5.\r\nThe metacarpals are elongate and rather stout. The phalanges of the distal\r\nseries have been lost, so the phalangeal formula can not be determined.\r\nOn the whole, the hand has a very broad aspect and is not at all slender,\r\nas in the majority of the microsaurians from the Coal Measures of Ohio.\r\nIt resembles in a great measure the broad hand of a toad and may thus be\r\nindicative of a terrestrial life. The humerus is well developed and has\r\npronounced swellings, as though for the attachment of strong muscles.\r\nThese indications would favor the view of the animal being a land dweller.\r\n\r\nThe femur and a part of the tibia (?) of the right side are all there\r\nis preserved of the hind limb. These elements show the leg to have been\r\nquite long, though weaker than the fore limb. The femur has a large distal\r\narticular surface. The fibula is, apparently, absent, though it may simply\r\nbe lost.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Pelion_ stands alone among the Carboniferous Amphibia. The\r\nform can not be placed in the order Branchiosauria on account of the\r\nwell-developed limb bones and the large mandible. It may belong with\r\nthe Microsauria. I have placed it under the Salientia in the hope of\r\nlearning more about the early relatives of the tailless forms. There is\r\nno assurance at all that it is even ancestral to the Salientia, but the\r\nresemblances are striking.\r\n\r\nThe following gives the measurements of the type specimens:\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type Specimen.[B]\r\n\r\n                                           mm.\r\n  Length of specimen, as preserved         110\r\n  Median length of the skull                24\r\n  Width across the mandibular angles        25\r\n  Greatest width of skull                   30\r\n  Length of vertebral column from occiput\r\n    to sacral region                        80\r\n  Length of left humerus                    19\r\n  Width of distal end of left humerus        5.5\r\n  Length of radius and ulna                 11.5\r\n  Width of distal end of radius              2\r\n  Length of digit II, as preserved          16\r\n  Length of digit III, as preserved         14\r\n  Length of femur                           24\r\n  Width of distal end of femur               4\r\n  Length of tibia                           18\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: The type specimen was collected in 1857 by Dr. John V.\r\nLauderdale, who presented it to Dr. J.

COAL MEASURES TO PERMIAN.\r\n\r\n(Europe and North America.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group is here defined according to the English edition of Zittel's\r\nText Book of Paleontology, 1902, p. 125. \"Notochord persistent and\r\nenclosed in constricted bony cylinders, hour-glass-shaped in longitudinal\r\nsection. Teeth simple, conical, hollow.\" According to Zittel there are two\r\nfamilies, the Microsauridæ and the Aistopodidæ. The latter family is dealt\r\nwith under _Aistopoda_ (p. 76) and it is there shown that the group is\r\nin no wise a valid one. The former family is regarded as an order and is\r\nfully entitled to that rank. As defined here the subclass _Lepospondylia_\r\ncontains but a single order, the _Microsauria_.\r\n\r\nExtinct, terrestrial, aquatic, or semi-aquatic amphibians; skull pitted\r\nand grooved by lateral-line canals and by sculpturing marks, or the skull\r\nmay be smooth; teeth present on most of the palate bones; exoccipitals\r\ncartilaginous or calcified, never completely osseous; sclerotic plates\r\nsometimes present; skull of various shapes. Vertebræ with notochord\r\nlargely persistent, hour-glass-shaped; neural spines low or high, or\r\nabsent; ribs intercentral and single-headed, with an incipient tubercle\r\nin some forms; vertebral column differentiated into dorsal and caudal\r\nseries; cervical series not clearly defined. Limb bones with well-ossified\r\nperichondrium, endochondrium partly ossified; epiphyses absent; carpus and\r\ntarsus (tarsus osseous in two species) cartilaginous; phalanges clawed or\r\nnot; digits 4 in hand and 5 in foot. Pubis sometimes calcified but never\r\nosseous.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Definition of the Order Microsauria Dawson, 1863. Coal Measures And\r\n  Permian.\r\n\r\n  (Europe and North America.)\r\n\r\n  Lizard-like, sometimes longicaudate, stegocephalous, lepospondylous,\r\n  ambulatory or legless amphibians; skull bones usually sculptured\r\n  with pits and grooves; lateral-line canals well developed on skull\r\n  bones; skull with horns from tabulare and supratemporals or without\r\n  horns; branchiæ never persistent; sclerotic plates present; orbits\r\n  usually well forward. Vertebræ hour-glass-shaped; endochondral\r\n  bone weakly developed throughout skeleton, especially in vertebræ;\r\n  notochord largely persistent; neural spines low and rudimentary or\r\n  long, fan-shaped, and highly ornamented. Dorsal series of vertebral\r\n  column variable; usually from 22 to 30; tail containing sometimes over\r\n  75 vertebræ, or tail very short with 2 weakly developed vertebræ;\r\n  caudal ribs present, in those forms with long caudal series the distal\r\n  vertebræ sometimes exhibiting 2 pleurocentra. Ribs long and curved,\r\n  always intercentral in position, single-headed, with at times an\r\n  incipient tubercle. Pectoral girdle composed of scapulæ, clavicles,\r\n  coracoids, and interclavicle. Pelvic girdle composed of osseous\r\n  rod-like ilium, plate-like ischium; pubis cartilaginous, sometimes\r\n  calcined. Limbs present or wanting or weakly developed, sometimes\r\n  present in front and wanting behind. Radius and ulna and tibia and\r\n  fibula free; carpus and tarsus usually cartilaginous; digits 4 in\r\n  hand and 5 in foot, terminal phalanges sometimes clawed. Phalangeal\r\n  formula for the hand 2-2-3-2, for the foot 2-2-3-4-3. Abdomen covered\r\n  with dermal armature composed of osseous or corneous rods or scutes;\r\n  overlapping scales, fish-like in appearance, sometimes present over\r\n  the entire body; body also covered with lizard-like scales or naked.\r\n\r\nThe order Microsauria was established by Sir William Dawson in 1863 (208)\r\nas a _family_ of \"reptiles\" for the reception of the genera _Hylonomus_,\r\n_Hylerpeton_, _Smilerpeton_, and _Fritschia_. _Hylonomus lyelli_ is the\r\ntype species of the order. Dawson (216, p. 635) says of the species\r\n_Hylonomus lyelli_ Dawson: \"It is the type of the genus _Hylonomus_ and of\r\nthe family Microsauria.\" The forms which have been referred to the genus\r\n_Hylonomus_, and hence to the order Microsauria, from the deposits of\r\nEurope are discussed under _Hylonomus_.\r\n\r\nThe Microsauria have been regarded by the writer and others as being\r\nancestral in a sense to some of the later reptiles (469), but there seem\r\nto be insuperable obstacles in the way of a direct derivation of the\r\nreptiles from the Microsauria. One of these obstacles seems to be found\r\nin the structure of the hand. In all Microsauria, so far as is known,\r\nthere is no evidence of more than 4 digits in the hand, while no true\r\nprimitive reptile possessed less than 5. The carpus of all true reptiles\r\nis osseous, while that of the Microsauria is merely cartilaginous. It is\r\npossible that the Microsauria stand in some such ancestral relation to\r\nthe later reptiles as the Crossopterygia (489_b_) do to the Amphibia.\r\nThe Microsauria had undergone adaptive modifications as to structure and\r\nhabit, so that they have paralleled many of the groups of reptiles, but\r\ntheir structure is quite different. The evidence, as far as we can see\r\nnow, points to a close genetic relation between the reptiles and the\r\nMicrosauria, but that this relation is ancestral I, for one, am not ready\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nThe Group _Aistopoda Miall_, 1873, is untenable.\r\n\r\nThe group _Aistopoda_ was established in 1873 as section IX by the\r\nCommittee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, in\r\ntheir \"Tabular View of the Classification of the Labyrinthodonts.\" L. C.\r\nMiall (449, 450) was the secretary of the committee, and the report was\r\npublished in two parts. Two genera were at that time attributed to the\r\nAistopoda, _Ophiderpeton_ and _Dolichosoma_, both described by Huxley from\r\nthe Coal Measures of Kilkenny, Ireland.\r\n\r\nFritsch (251, pp. 107-126) in 1883 refers to the group as \"Familie\"\r\nand describes 4 genera and 9 species as belonging to the group. Zittel\r\n(642, p. 383) refers to the group as \"Familie\" and places 5 genera in\r\nit. Smith-Woodward (Vertebrate Paleontology, 1898, p. 129) refers the\r\nAistopoda to a suborder. In Eastman's translation of Zittel's Paleontology\r\nthe group is called a family, \"Aistopodidæ.\" Lydekker (393, p. 205)\r\nregards the group as a suborder. The writer (469) refers the Aistopoda\r\nto an order. The group Aistopoda has been adopted by practically all\r\npaleontologists and zoologists who have had occasion to refer to these\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nLydekker (393) in 1890 defined the group as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Body long and snake-like, without limbs, and apparently without\r\n  pectoral or pelvic girdles. Vertebræ with elongated centra and aborted\r\n  neural spines. Ribs slender, and barbed like those of fishes. Teeth\r\n  smooth, without plications of the dentine. External gills probably\r\n  persistent.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                            PLATE 8\r\n\r\n_Fritschia curtidentata_ Dawson.

Original specimen in the Peter Redpath\r\nMuseum of McGill University.]\r\n\r\nIf now we take up a consideration of each of the characters mentioned\r\nby Lydekker we find that the first one holds good for all examples of\r\nthe group. The second character, \"without limbs,\" is not good. Species\r\nof _Œstocephalus_, _Ptyonius_, _Molgophis_ all possess limbs; and\r\ndoubtless Ophiderpeton will be found to possess limbs also, since it\r\nhas a well-developed pectoral girdle. The limbs in all of these genera\r\nare small. The third character, \"apparently without pectoral and pelvic\r\ngirdles,\" is not at all a good character, since nearly every specimen of\r\nsome species and almost all species show evidences of pectoral girdles\r\nand a few exhibit pelvic girdles. The fourth character, \"vertebræ with\r\nelongated centra and aborted neural spines,\" is not a good distinguishing\r\ncharacter, since _Amphibamus_, an undoubted microsaurian, possesses\r\nthe same vertebral characters. \"Ribs slender, and barbed like those of\r\nfishes\" is a character which is common to several widely distinct genera.\r\nAll Microsauria possess long, slender ribs, and the barbed condition\r\nis one which is possessed by only a few, _Thyrsidium_, _Ophiderpeton_,\r\netc., the so-called \"barb\" being merely a highly exaggerated tuberculum.\r\nThe teeth of nearly all Microsauria are smooth, so that the character\r\n\"teeth smooth\" is not a good one for a group definition. It has not been\r\npossible to examine any of the American specimens for the plication of\r\nthe dentine, since the forms are so rare and the fossils very fragile.\r\nThe last character, \"external gills probably persistent,\" is certainly\r\nnot true for the American species, and the evidence for the European\r\nspecies is negative. Fritsch described and figured (Fauna der Gaskohle,\r\nBd. I, 1883, p. 114, Tafeln 18 and 23) structures which he regarded as\r\nsupporting structures for the external branchiæ. He says in regard to\r\nthese structures:\r\n\r\n  \"Bei dem Umstande, dass sie von der Kiemengegend aus sich\r\n  büschelförmig verbreiten und man ihren Contakt mit einer Art von\r\n  Branchiæ constatiren kann, zweifle ich nicht daran, dass diese\r\n  Stäbchen dem Kiemenapparate angehören. Bedenklich ist nur ihre\r\n  grosse Zahl und das Vorkommen bis zum 16ten Wirbel und ich erwog\r\n  die Möglichkeit, dass diese Stäbchen einem zarten Bauchpanzer\r\n  angehören könnten. Da aber weiter im Verlaufe der ganzen Wirbelsäule\r\n  nichts Aehnliches vorkömmt, so ist man gezwungen anzunehmen, dass\r\n  _Dolichosoma_ sehr grosse lange Kiemenbüschel besessen haben muss.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Samuel Budgett (79, p. 162), in his discussion of the \"Structure\r\nof the Larval Polypterus,\" refers to the above-described specimen of\r\n\"aistopodous Stegocephali,\" _i.e._, _Dolichosoma longissimum_ Fritsch,\r\nand calls especial attention to the similarity of the external rod\r\nof segmented cartilage on the hyomandibular of _Polypterus_ to this\r\nstructure, to which Fritsch has assigned a branchiate nature in\r\n_Dolichosoma_. There is no doubt in the mind of the present writer,\r\nhowever, that the rod of cartilage, referred by Fritsch to the gills,\r\ncan be other than scutellate rods of the ventral armature, these rods\r\nbelonging to the armature of the breast or throat. The evidence for this\r\nconclusion is furnished by Fritsch himself (Fauna der Gaskohle, Bd. I,\r\nplate 18, fig. 11), where all may read in the figure of the specimen the\r\nfacts of the case. There is quite evidently no justification for Fritsch's\r\nconclusion of the branchiate nature of _Dolichosoma_. There is no evidence\r\nof any gill-like structure in the American snake-like amphibians of the\r\nCoal Measures.\r\n\r\nReviewing, then, the characters of the group which have been assigned by\r\nvarious observers, it will be seen that there is but a single character\r\nwhich holds good: \"body long and snake-like.\" This is totally insufficient\r\nfor the retention of the group. I therefore propose to abolish the group\r\nentirely from zoological classification. It is not even a family. It will,\r\nhowever, be convenient to refer to the snake-like forms as \"aistopodous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSAURIAN FAMILY HYLONOMIDÆ, FROM THE COAL MEASURES OF NOVA SCOTIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Family HYLONOMIDÆ Fritsch, 1883.=\r\n\r\n  Fritsch, Fauna der Gaskohle und der Kalksteine der Permformations\r\n    Böhmens, Bd. 1, p. 159, 1883.\r\n\r\n  Lydekker, Cat.

I have reproduced in plate 9 Dawson's figures of the\r\nremains of _Hylonomus_ as published by him in 1891.\r\n\r\nDawson (216) gave, in 1882, the following definition of the genus\r\n_Hylonomus_: \"Form lizard-like, with the posterior limbs somewhat large in\r\nproportion to the anterior. Size, small. Mandibular and maxillary teeth\r\nnumerous, small, conical, pointed. Palatal teeth minute.

There is much uncertainty as to the\r\nvalidity of these references, due to the uncertain nature of the type of\r\nHylonomus. There are 4 American species of the genus: _Hylonomus latidens_\r\nDawson, _H. lyelli_ Dawson, _H. multidens_ Dawson, and _H. wymani_ Dawson.\r\nAll the species are from the Coal Beds at the South Joggins, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hylonomus lyelli Dawson.=\r\n\r\n  Dawson, Quart.

Horizon and locality: Coal formation of the South Joggins, Nova\r\nScotia. This species is by far the most abundant (plate 9) in the erect\r\ntrees examined by Dawson. Its characters Dawson (216) defines as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"General form lizard-like, with the hind limbs rather larger than the\r\n  fore limbs. Length when mature, 5 to 6 inches.\r\n\r\n  \"Head somewhat elongate; bones of skull smooth or with microscopic\r\n  striæ, perfectly united, except at the parietal foramen. Occipital\r\n  condyle double, and apparently bony. Teeth simple, conical, numerous,\r\n  about forty in each mandible, and nearly equal, except that a few of\r\n  the anterior ones are rather larger than the others. The teeth are\r\n  anchylosed to the jaw in a furrow protected by an external bony plate.\r\n\r\n  \"Vertebræ with cylindrical bodies, slightly concave at the ends. When\r\n  partly exfoliated they appear hour-glass-shaped, in consequence of\r\n  the internal cartilage having the form of two cones attached by their\r\n  apices. Zygapophyses conspicuous above; neural arches united to the\r\n  bodies of the vertebræ, and with broad neural spines. Dorsal vertebræ\r\n  with strong lateral processes. Caudal vertebræ apparently simple and\r\n  cylindrical. Number of vertebræ in neck and trunk about thirty.\r\n\r\n  \"Ribs long and curved, with capitulum and tuberculum, cartilaginous\r\n  within.\r\n\r\n  \"Anterior limb slender, humerus with distinct keel; radius and ulna\r\n  separate; toes four or five.\r\n\r\n  \"Posterior limb with well-developed femur; tibia and fibula shorter,\r\n  separate; toes five, somewhat long and slender.\r\n\r\n  \"Pelvis large, composed of ilium and ischium.\"\r\n\r\nInterclavicle and numerous scutellæ are present.

IV, p. 224) also has a specimen, No. R 433.\r\n\r\nThe important characteristic (plate 12) is found in the form of the\r\nmandibular and maxillary teeth, which are of a peculiar wedge-shape, being\r\nbroad and oval at the base and narrowed to a longitudinal edge at top.\r\nThus, when viewed from the side they appear narrow and blunt, but when the\r\njaw is broken across, and they are viewed from the rear or front, they\r\nappear broad and sharp-edged. The effect of this arrangement is that the\r\njaw is armed with a closely placed series of chisels or wedges, giving an\r\nalmost continuous edge. At the end of the mandible some of the teeth are\r\nlonger and more conical.\r\n\r\nAnother important character is that the palatal and vomerine bones seem to\r\nhave bristled with teeth, mostly of very small size; but there are also\r\nsome larger palatal teeth, of which some are sharply pointed and others\r\nblunt with furrowed points.\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ are of the same type as those of _Hylonomus_; but some which\r\nappear to be caudal have a pointed spine above, indicating perhaps a\r\nflattened tail. The ribs are short and stout.\r\n\r\nThe body seems to have possessed an interclavicle and ventral scutellæ.\r\nAbove it was, apparently, clothed with small tubercles and horny scales,\r\nand to have had cuticular pendants like those of _Dendrerpeton_.\r\n\r\nAn additional species of this genus was apparently indicated by some\r\nfragmentary remains, but Dawson thought best not to describe them as such,\r\nsince they might indicate only a young individual of the present species.\r\n\r\n  Length of mandible           1.5 cm.\r\n  Length of femur              1.5 cm.\r\n  Length of humerus (?)        1.3 cm.\r\n  Length of vertebra           3-5 mm.\r\n  Length of rib                1   cm.\r\n    There are 5 teeth in 2 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.

II, pp. 391, 1875.\r\n\r\nType: _Tuditanus punctulatus_ Cope.\r\n\r\nThe genus as here defined is a somewhat composite group and it is quite\r\nprobable that some of the species here included will have to be removed to\r\nanother genus when the anatomy of the forms is better known. The species\r\nof the genus are all moderately small, the largest barely attaining a\r\nlength of 8 inches.\r\n\r\nThere are 5 species of Tuditanus thus far known. All of the species are\r\ncharacterized by the possession of a peculiar triangular-shaped clavicle\r\nwith radiating grooves, and this has been taken as one of the distinctive\r\ncharacters of the genus, as well as of the family. The structure of the\r\ncranium where known is quite uniform among the different species. The\r\nsquamosal is quite large and the supratemporal is not always closely\r\njoined to the parietal. The species are:\r\n\r\n  _Tuditanus punctulatus_ Cope, Linton, Ohio.\r\n            _brevirostris_ Cope, Linton, Ohio.\r\n            _longipes_ Cope, Linton, Ohio.\r\n            _minimus_ Moodie, Cannelton, Pennsylvania.\r\n            _walcotti_ Moodie, Linton, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tuditanus punctulatus Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc., XV, p. 271, 1874.\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol. Surv. Ohio, II, pt. II, p. 392, pl. xxxiv, fig. I, 1875.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 110, American Museum of Natural History, where there is\r\nalso specimen No. 111.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThis species, together with the form, _T. brevirostris_, described on\r\np. 88, was used by Cope as the type of the genus _Tuditanus_. Cope\r\nsubsequently associated some reptilian remains from the Linton mines with\r\nthe type of _T. punctulatus_ and changed the generic term to _Isodectes_,\r\nwhich was known by another species, _I. megalops_ Cope, from the Permian\r\nof Texas. The remains associated by Cope with _I. megalops_ undoubtedly\r\nrepresent a reptilian species and which has been described elsewhere\r\nunder the name _Eosauravus copei_ Williston. The species is of exceeding\r\ninterest because it is the _oldest known reptile_ and places the range of\r\nthe Reptilia down towards the base of the Pennsylvanian.\r\n\r\nThe species _Tuditanus punctulatus_ Cope was founded on well-preserved\r\nremains of nearly the entire skeleton of a single individual. The bones\r\nare represented by shining carbonaceous matter, and since both of the\r\nslabs containing the impression were preserved, a great many characters\r\nhave been determined. The head, 1 fore-limb, and 23 consecutive vertebræ\r\nwith ribs are well defined, but of the pelvis and hind limbs nothing is\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThe cranium (fig. 19) is very similar to that of _T. minimus_, from\r\nthe Cannelton, Pennsylvania, slates. It is triangular in shape, with a\r\nnarrowed obtuse muzzle. The orbit of the left side is well defined and\r\nlies well forward. It is oval in outline and its width is about two-thirds\r\nof its length. The nostrils are small and are located well toward the tip\r\nof the muzzle. The parietal foramen lies behind the median transverse line\r\nwhich divides the skull equally.\r\n\r\nThe cranial elements are for the most part destroyed, but the outlines of\r\na few can be determined. Those elements which are preserved are ornamented\r\nwith a sculpturing of minute punctulations which, on the postfrontal,\r\nassumes a radiating arrangement. The ornamentation of the other elements\r\nconsists of inosculating pits, but they seldom assume the form of ridges\r\nor grooves. The bones of the premaxillary region of the cranium are\r\nlacking. The first element which can be detected is the pref rental, which\r\noccupies a position in front of the orbit. There seems to be space for\r\na lacrimal, but its outline is not distinct. The frontal can be readily\r\nseparated and is seen to be an elongate element occupying the median\r\nregion of the skull between the orbits. The parietal is apparently the\r\nlargest element of the cranial roof and the pineal foramen is located in\r\nthe anterior fourth of the median suture separating the parietal elements.\r\nThe form of the postparietal and the tabulare can not be determined, as\r\nthe greater part of this region is lacking. The squamosal seems to be\r\nlocated well forward and is rather small, but has the usual relation of\r\nthis element. Only fragments of the other elements remain and nothing\r\ncan be said of their form. The mandibles of both sides are represented\r\nby depressions, and they are ornamented with longitudinal grooves and\r\nridges. The teeth are not preserved, but there are evidences of the\r\nmaxillary teeth. These are minute and sharply conical. Just posterior to\r\nthe skull there is preserved the impression of a short, round rod which is\r\nnot definitely determined. It may be an element of the hyoid apparatus,\r\nalthough it is rather stout for such. It does not have the relations\r\nindicated by Cope in his figure (123, pl. XXXIV, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.

These\r\nundoubtedly represent the interclavicle and the clavicles. The\r\ninterclavicle is rhomboid in shape and is attenuated posteriorly. The\r\nattenuation is abruptly truncate posteriorly and it is thus of quite\r\na different character from the acutely pointed interclavicle of _T.\r\nminimus_. The clavicle has a somewhat semicircular form, but is not\r\nattenuated at either end. It seems to be uniformly broad.\r\n\r\nThe forearm of the right side is preserved in part. The humerus is seen\r\nto be a heavy, somewhat expanded element lying displaced with relation\r\nto the pectoral girdle. It is greatly expanded at the ends. The ulna\r\npresents characters similar to the humerus and only differs from it in\r\nbeing shorter and less stout. The radius is not preserved. The carpus\r\nis unossified and its position is occupied by a blank space. The digits\r\nare represented by 4 metacarpals, and this may have constituted the\r\nentire number of the fingers. The phalangeal bones preserved are a little\r\nscattered. They are elongate with expanded ends.\r\n\r\nEvidences of 23 consecutive osseous vertebræ are preserved. Their\r\ncharacter can not be determined, although Cope (123) describes them as\r\namphicœlous. This may be inferred to be the case, but I am unable to\r\nverify his observation. In form the vertebra are subquadrate. The neural\r\nspines are not evident. The osseous ribs articulate, apparently, between\r\nthe bodies of the vertebra. Cope figured them as intercentral. There are\r\n22 or 23 pairs preserved. They are single-headed and the extremities are\r\nattenuated. No traces of ventral scutellæ are present.\r\n\r\nThe entire length of the animal probably did not exceed 5 or 6 inches.\r\nIts form was quite lizard-like and it was probably of an ambulatory type,\r\nthough it may have spent a part of its time in the old lagoon in which\r\nits remains were finally buried.

Represented by a portion of the skeleton of one\r\nindividual, the skull is preserved on one block, with a considerable part\r\nof the anterior ribs, pectoral girdle, and vertebral column, although this\r\nlast is not clearly represented, but as in so many of the coal specimens\r\nthe bones are covered with a thin layer of carbonaceous matter which makes\r\nit impossible to definitely determine the form.\r\n\r\nThe cranium is large in proportion to the size of the body. The skull is\r\nin the form of a wide oval and is wider than it is long. The elements of\r\nthe skull were ornamented with a coarse sculpturing which partakes of the\r\nnature of incomplete radiations on the squamosal region. The different\r\nelements of the cranium can not be distinguished, although I think the\r\noutlines of the parietal are indicated. The position of the nostrils is\r\nwell forward and they are slightly elongate transversely. The pineal\r\nforamen can not be determined. The orbits are oval in shape and their\r\nwidth is about equal to two-thirds of their length. The interorbital space\r\nis greater than the length of the orbit. Cope's figure of this specimen is\r\nnot accurate, since he has the orbits drawn too far to the side. They are\r\nlocated near the central line of the skull and resemble in some respect\r\nthose of the preceding species. Cope has described teeth in the maxillary\r\nregion, but I am unable to detect them. There are portions of two pectoral\r\nelements which may represent a clavicle and a portion of the interclavicle.\r\n\r\nThe clavicle has much the same shape and practically the same\r\nornamentations as has the clavicle in _Tuditanus minimus_. The clavicle\r\npreserved shows a somewhat triangular shape and is slightly acuminate\r\nat the anterior end, as preserved, and obtuse at the posterior end. The\r\nnature of the interclavicle can not be determined.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral column is represented by a line which Cope suggests (123)\r\nmay be the chorda dorsalis (notochord). Osseous vertebræ were probably\r\npresent, but their nature is obscured by the carbonaceous matter covering\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe ribs as preserved are long and curved. They are slender and attenuated\r\nat the distal ends. They were probably single-headed, but whether their\r\narticulation was intercentral or not can not be determined.\r\n\r\nThe other specimens which are referred to this species show nothing of\r\nimportance in the way of structure. They consist for the most part of\r\nfragments which may or may not represent the species.\r\n\r\nThe species differs from the type of the genus (_T. punctulatus_) in the\r\npossession of a broadly rounded muzzle. This character will also separate\r\nit from other species of the genus. The sculpturing of the bones of the\r\ncranium is coarser in the present species than in the type. The form\r\nof the clavicle is different in the two species. The above-described\r\nspecies seems to be more closely allied to the form described as Tuditanus\r\nwalcotti than to other species of the genus. I have been unable to detect\r\nthe presence of limbs, although Cope says they are present.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Tuditanus brevirostris Cope.\r\n\r\n                                       mm.\r\n  Median length of skull               15\r\n  Width of skull at posterior border   18\r\n  Width of skull across orbits         11.5\r\n  Length of orbit                       3\r\n  Width of orbit                        2\r\n  Interorbital space                    4.5\r\n  Length of clavicle                    7\r\n  Width of clavicle                     3\r\n  Length of longest rib preserved       9\r\n  Length of entire specimen            54\r\n\r\nThe material consists of the type specimen with counterpart and two\r\nfragments which probably are to be associated with this species.

The only genus with\r\nwhich the specimen can be compared in the structure of the skeleton is\r\n_Tuditanus_. From the other species of the genus the present form differs\r\nin the presence of ventral chevron rods and the elongate character of the\r\nlimbs, as well as in the possession of large iliac bones, which, in the\r\nonly other species in which the ilia are known, are small and slender. It\r\nseems best to locate the species in this genus for the present, although\r\nit may eventually have to be removed to another group. Very little is\r\nknown of the main portion of the skeleton of the species of _Tuditanus_,\r\nother than in _T. longipes_, so an exact comparison is impossible. From\r\nall the species of Tuditanus thus far known the present species differs\r\nin the elongate character of the limbs and in the presence of ventral\r\nscutellation. There are three other species of Tuditanus in which the\r\nlimbs are known. These are: _T. walcotti_ Moodie, _T. minimus_ Moodie,\r\nand _T. punctulatus_ Cope. In these three species the limbs are short\r\nand weakly developed. From the other species of _Tuditanus_ the present\r\nspecies maybe separated by its size principally, since nothing of the\r\nbodies of the other species is known.\r\n\r\nThe body of the present species is elongate and slender, with a long neck\r\nand probably a long tail. Ribs, as preserved, are 19 to 22, though there\r\nmay possibly have been more. They are moderately curved backwards, have\r\nintercentral articulation, are attenuated at the distal extremity, and are\r\nsingle-headed. The anterior ribs are stouter, with a widened upper portion\r\nand attenuated distal part. The posterior ribs are more slender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Cope's drawing of Tuditanus longipes, from the\r\nLinton, Ohio, Coal Measures. × 1.]\r\n\r\nThere are evidences of 28 vertebræ present. All regions of the vertebral\r\ncolumn are present and the dorsal region is preserved entire. The\r\ncervical series is represented by the posterior vertebræ only. These are\r\nvery indistinctly preserved. The dorsal vertebræ are elongate and were\r\nprobably amphicœlous, although this has not been definitely determined.\r\nThey are expanded at each end, thus ending in a slightly raised rim. The\r\nsingle-headed ribs articulate between the vertebræ. The exact number of\r\nthe dorsal series can not be ascertained, although this may have been\r\n25. The spines of the vertebræ are not determinable, since the animal is\r\npreserved on its back. The caudal vertebræ are represented by two patches\r\nof the remains of what was once probably the entire series. Cope ascribes\r\n70 mm. to the tail, but I do not find that much. The specimen may have\r\nbeen mutilated since he studied it. The caudals are slender and, like the\r\ndorsals, are expanded at the extremities.\r\n\r\nThe scapular arch is not preserved, but the pelvic arch is represented by\r\nthe two iliac bones in good state of preservation. These are short, flat\r\nbones expanded at the anterior extremity, as preserved. They lie turned\r\na little to each side of the vertebral column and partially obscure the\r\nfemora. The iliac bones are quite characteristic of this form, since\r\nsimilar-shaped elements have not been observed in any of the other\r\nCarboniferous forms from the same deposit.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the forelimb is preserved, although much of the hand\r\nis missing. The humerus is an unusually elongate bone and lies somewhat\r\nacross the vertebral column. It is crushed flat and the ends are partly\r\ndestroyed. It shows evidences of expansion at the ends, although not a\r\ngreat deal. It is much longer than the radius and ulna, which are of about\r\nequal length. The ulna is larger than the radius and has expanded ends,\r\nwith the upper end more expanded than the lower and both ends slightly\r\ntruncate. The radius is a simple rod of bone and is but slightly expanded.\r\nThe carpus was evidently cartilaginous, since there is no evidence of\r\nosseous material in its place. There is but one phalangeal bone preserved,\r\nand, since this is displaced with reference to the ulna and radius, its\r\nposition can not be determined. It may have been a metacarpal. It is short\r\nand expanded at the ends.\r\n\r\nThe hind limbs are represented by the two femora and the upper portion\r\nof the tibia. The femur is almost as elongate as the humerus and is more\r\nslender. It is not so much expanded as the humerus. Its ends appear to\r\nhave been cartilaginous and do not represent the well-formed articular\r\nsurfaces preserved in the _T. minimus_. The upper part of the tibia is\r\npreserved, and appears to have been truncate.\r\n\r\nIf this species belongs with _Tuditanus_ it is of interest in that the\r\nventral chevrons are present. The species is particularly characterized by\r\nthe elongate limbs.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Tuditanus longipes Cope.\r\n\r\n                                                  mm.\r\n  Length of vertebral column between pelvis and\r\n    end of humerus                                 7\r\n  Length of vertebral column anterior to humerus  18\r\n  Length of caudals present                       42\r\n  Length of humerus                               19\r\n  Width of humerus                                 2\r\n  Length of radius and ulna                       12\r\n  Length of a vertebra                             3\r\n  Length of ilium                                  7\r\n  Length of femur, estimated                      18\r\n    7 chevrons in 4 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tuditanus minimus Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour.

National Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Cannelton slates of Pennsylvania (Upper Freeport).\r\n\r\nThe species is represented by a nearly complete skeleton preserved on a\r\nslab of slate from the Cannelton shales of Pennsylvania. The obverse slab\r\nhas been lost, which is very unfortunate, since there is no doubt that\r\nthe entire skeleton was originally present. The species is placed in the\r\ngenus Tuditanus on account of the close resemblance to the type form _T.\r\npunctulatus_ Cope, although it is much smaller than that species.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen of the species did not attain a length of more than\r\n3.5 inches. Its form is very lizard-like, but its structure is typically\r\namphibian. The form of the skull is especially similar to that of the\r\ntype species _T. punctulatus_, which it resembles in the narrow posterior\r\ntruncation of the skull, as well as in the anterior position of the orbits.\r\n\r\nThe skull is in the form of a narrow oval, sharply narrowed posteriorly\r\nand truncate. The orbits are located well forward and their posterior\r\nborder lies in front of the line dividing the skull transversely into\r\nequal parts. The interorbital space is greater than the diameter of the\r\norbit. Impressions of teeth are preserved on the premaxillæ and maxillæ;\r\nthere are 8 of them in a distance of 3 mm. The teeth appear to be mere\r\nblunt denticles and were possibly pleurodont.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the cranium are very poorly preserved. It has been\r\nimpossible to determine all of the sutures. The bones of the premaxillary\r\nregion have been destroyed, but the arrangement of them was probably not\r\nfar different from that which obtains in other members of the genus. The\r\nposterior boundaries of the nasals are preserved and prove this element\r\nto have had an obtuse posterior border. The sutures bounding the frontals\r\nare clear and show that they were small and that they formed a part of\r\nthe inner boundary of the orbits. The parietal is recognized as a large\r\nelement, apparently the largest in the skull. Together the parietals form\r\na wide oval inclosing, on the median suture, the circular pineal foramen.\r\nThe parietals are sculptured with coarse radiating grooves and ridges,\r\nmuch after the manner of _Erpetosaurus radiatus_ Cope. The pittings\r\npresent on that form are, however, absent in _T. minimus_. The sutures\r\nbounding the postparietal are tolerably well defined and these show that\r\nelement to have been rather large and quadrate, with the usual relations.\r\nThe tabulare is distinct, triangular, and small. It is produced into an\r\nangle on the posterior border strongly recalling a similar condition in\r\n_T. punctulatus_. The boundaries of the prefrontals and the upper borders\r\nof the maxillæ are not clearly ascertained. The lacrimal has not been\r\ndetected. The post-frontal and postorbital form the posterior boundary\r\nof the orbit, although all of the limits of the latter element have not\r\nbeen definitely determined. The position of the supratemporal is well\r\nassured, although its entire boundaries are not determined. It has the\r\nusual relations and joins the parietal broadly. The jugal is broad and\r\nwidens posteriorly to join the squamosal, which, as usual, forms the\r\nquadrate angle of the skull. The sutures bounding the quadratojugal and\r\nthe posterior end of the maxilla are not determined.\r\n\r\nThere are but two fragmentary vertebræ preserved and an estimate based\r\non the length of these remains gives about 30 presacral vertebræ. The\r\nstructure of the vertebræ preserved can not be ascertained, but the neural\r\nspines appear to have been low and stout.\r\n\r\nThere are six elements of the pectoral girdle preserved. These are: the\r\nsix clavicles, the interclavicle, the coracoid of one side, and the two\r\nscapulæ. The interclavicle is rhomboid in form and acuminate posteriorly.\r\nIt is sculptured with radiating grooves and ridges. It is quite different\r\nfrom the same element in _T. punctulatus_, in that the base is acuminate,\r\nnot truncate. The clavicle presents much the same shape as does that\r\nelement in _Erpetosaurus tabulatus_. It is ornamented by a sculpturing of\r\nradiating lines which take their origin from the lower external angle as\r\nthe bone lies in the matrix. The clavicle is somewhat triangular in shape\r\nand lies close to the skull, but this close approximation of the pectoral\r\nelements to the cranium is due probably to post-mortem shifting, since the\r\nscapulæ are shifted backward. There can be little doubt, however, that\r\nthe pectoral arch was close to the cranium. There is an oval fragment\r\npreserved on the left of the specimen which I take to be a portion of\r\nthe coracoid. The scapula is preserved entire on the left side and is\r\nrepresented by fragments on the right side. It is almost semicircular in\r\nform and narrows externally until it is somewhat fan-shaped. There appears\r\nto be an ornamentation of lines on the surface of the bone. These lines\r\nfollow the contour of the anterior border.\r\n\r\nThe arm is preserved nearly complete on the left side, and the right\r\nside shows the humerus and the forearm. The humeri are unusual in having\r\nwell-developed articular ends as though the endochondral tissue was\r\nwell developed. The humerus is expanded at the ends and it is larger at\r\nthe upper than at the lower end. The ulna is expanded at the proximal\r\nextremity, but is more attenuated at the distal portion. It is shorter\r\nthan the humerus by about one-third of its own length. The radius is a\r\nmere slender rod of bone and presents well-developed articular ends. It is\r\nslightly shorter than the ulna. The carpus is unossified and its position\r\nis represented by a blank space. There are phalanges of 4 digits preserved\r\nand they are 4 in number. The phalangeal elements, like the other bones of\r\nthe extremity, have the articular surfaces prominent, with the terminal\r\nphalanx claw-like.\r\n\r\nThere are no ribs nor traces of them preserved, and a conjecture as to\r\ntheir character can not be hazarded, since they are known in but two other\r\nspecies, in which they are slender and curved. There is no evidence of a\r\nventral scutellation, and so far as is at present known this structure\r\nis absent from all of the species of the genus, or at least it is weakly\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe ilium is all that is preserved of the pelvis. The bone itself has\r\ndisappeared and has left a depression which shows this element to have\r\nbeen an elongate rod very similar to that described for _Micrerpeton_. The\r\nsacral vertebra seems to be indicated by a depression between the iliac\r\ndepressions.\r\n\r\nOne hind limb is preserved nearly entire and the greater part of the other\r\nis also preserved, although some of the phalanges are disturbed. The\r\nfemur is slender and more elongate than the humerus. It has well-formed,\r\nrounded, articular ends. The tibia presents unusual characters in that\r\nits ends are truncate, as though the cartilage composing its articular\r\nsurfaces was not so highly calcified as in the other limb bones. It\r\nis somewhat expanded at the ends and is throughout its length broader\r\nthan the femur. The fibula, like the tibia, is a slender rod of bone,\r\nalthough it is somewhat shorter than the tibia. The tarsus is unossified\r\nand its position is occupied by a blank space. Portions of both feet\r\nare preserved, but only one digit in the right foot is complete. The\r\nmetatarsals are elongate and slightly expanded at the ends. There are\r\n4 phalanges present in the complete digit, which possibly represents\r\nthe fourth. The first digit is wanting, with the only terminal phalanx\r\npreserved claw-like.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Tuditanus minimus Moodie.\r\n\r\n                                             mm.\r\n  Median length of skull                     15\r\n  Width of skull at posterior border         16\r\n  Length of orbit                             3.5\r\n  Width of orbit                              2\r\n  Interorbital width                          2.5\r\n  Length of clavicle                          6\r\n  Width of clavicle, maximum                  3.5\r\n  Length of interclavicle, estimated          5\r\n  Width of interclavicle                      3.5\r\n  Length of scapula                           3.5\r\n  Width of scapula, maximum                   2.5\r\n  Length of coracoid (?)                      2\r\n  Length of humerus                           4\r\n  Length of radius and ulna                   3\r\n  Length of metacarpal                        1\r\n  Length of ilium                             2.5\r\n  Length of femur                             4.5\r\n  Length of tibia and fibula                  3\r\n  Length of foot                              3.5\r\n  Length of metatarsal                         .75\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tuditanus walcotti Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Proc.

National Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nA small species of Microsauria is preserved as a smooth impression on a\r\nblock of soft coal from Linton, Ohio. Nearly the entire form of the body\r\nis discernible. The specimen is especially interesting and valuable as\r\nexhibiting for the first time among the Linton forms the shape of the\r\nbody of the small microsaurians of the Tuditanus type. It differs so\r\nmarkedly in the form of the skull from other species of the genus that\r\nit is regarded as a distinct form, and the name _Tuditanus walcotti_ was\r\nproposed for it as an expression of the writer's indebtedness to the\r\nSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution for the vise of the material\r\namong which the present form was included.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.

Left leg of second specimen of Tuditanus walcotti. × 3.]\r\n\r\nThe specimen includes, besides the body impression, the complete skull, a\r\nright clavicle, with portions of the left, a left humerus, 12 cervical and\r\ndorsal vertebræ, 10 pairs of ribs somewhat disturbed as to position, and a\r\nportion of the mandible. There are no traces of ventral scutellæ nor body\r\nscales in the smooth impression of the carbonized skin. One would expect\r\nto find impressions of the ventral scutæ in this specimen if they were\r\npresent. Cope remarked on the apparent absence of scutellæ from members of\r\nthe genus _Tuditanus_ as they were known to him, and no contrary evidence\r\nhas since been brought to light. Until such evidence is forthcoming the\r\nabsence of scutes will be taken as one of the generic characters of the\r\ngenus _Tuditanus_. Under a magnification of 50 diameters the carbonized\r\nskin shows as folds and wrinkles, like muscle fibers, in some places; in\r\nothers no traces of the muscular structure can be detected. The wrinkles\r\nmay be impressions of the internal musculature of the body-wall of the\r\nabdomen. It is especially well preserved in the pelvic and pygal regions.\r\nSections of the coal were made, but nothing definite could be determined\r\nas to the character of the impressions, as they were too poorly preserved\r\nand the coal was too soft to bear much handling.\r\n\r\nThe specimen is preserved on the belly, with the dorsum of the skull\r\nuppermost. It has been practically impossible to determine the arrangement\r\nof any of the cranial elements except the f rentals, parietals, and\r\npostparietals, which have the relations indicated in figure 21, A. A\r\nmedian suture is clearly evident, with the pineal foramen well back in\r\nthis suture. The bones of the skull are marked with faint radiating lines.\r\nIt is in the form of the skull and the position of the orbits that the\r\nspecific characters are found, as follows: the backward position of the\r\neyes and the oval, pointed shape of the skull. The species is closely\r\nrelated to _Tuditanus minimus_ Moodie, from the Cannelton slates of\r\nPennsylvania, and serves further to connect the forms from the Ohio and\r\nPennsylvania localities. It differs from the last-named species in the\r\nposition and form of the orbits, these structures being more oval in the\r\npresent form and placed further back. The shape of the skull differs also\r\nin the almost entire absence of the posterior table. The median points of\r\nthe orbits occupy the line which bisects the skull, and the interorbital\r\nwidth is less than the width of the orbit. The mandible is heavy and\r\nappears to have borne sharp, pleurodont teeth.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral column is represented by little more than a mold of the\r\nform of the vertebræ, so that little can be said of its character. The\r\nindividual vertebræ are short and hour-glass-shaped. The ribs are borne\r\nintercentrally, as in all the microsaurians which have been studied from\r\nthe Linton deposits. The ribs are rather long and somewhat heavy, slightly\r\ncurved and expanded at the proximal end, as though an incipient bicipital\r\ncondition were present.\r\n\r\nThe right clavicle, which is preserved as an impression, is entire. Its\r\nimpression shows this element to have been ornamented on its ventral\r\nsurface with radiating grooves and ridges which started at the lower angle\r\nof the bone. The element is distinctly triangular, which is characteristic\r\nof the genus _Tuditanus_, so far as known. The fragment of the left\r\nclavicle adds nothing to our knowledge of the element.\r\n\r\nThe left humerus recalls in a striking way that of _Tuditanus longipes_\r\nCope, and it was once entertained as a possibility that the present\r\nform might be a member of that species, since the skull is lacking in\r\n_T. longipes_. Sufficient specific differences were found, however, in\r\nthe ribs, which, in _T. longipes_, are very long, slightly curved, and\r\ndelicate, but which, in the present form, are comparatively heavy. Other\r\ncharacters sufficiently diagnostic are found in the form assumed by the\r\nvertebræ in the two forms.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Tuditanus walcotti Moodie.\r\n\r\n                                             mm.\r\n  Length of specimen                         70\r\n  Length of skull                            20\r\n  Posterior width of skull                   14\r\n  Width of skull, anterior to orbits         10\r\n  Length of orbit                             4\r\n  Width of orbit                              2\r\n  Interorbital width                          3\r\n  Length of clavicle                          9\r\n  Greatest width of clavicle                  4\r\n  Length of vertebral column, as preserved   50\r\n  Length of a vertebra                        1.75\r\n  Width of a vertebra                        50\r\n  Width of body impression                   15\r\n  Length of humerus                           6\r\n  Median width of humerus                    50\r\n  Width at end of humerus                     2\r\n  Length of rib                               8\r\n  Width of rib                               25\r\n\r\nThe above-described specimen was collected by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of\r\nPittston, Pennsylvania, from Linton, Ohio.\r\n\r\nA second individual (No. 4481, U. S. National Museum) of this species is\r\nindicated by a rather poorly preserved specimen on a slab of soft coal\r\nfrom the Linton mines. The following portions of the animal have been\r\ndetected and will be discussed: partial impression of the skull, with a\r\nfragment of a minute jaw, in which are minute teeth; right clavicle; part\r\nof the impression of the body; nearly entire left hind limb; impressions\r\nof about a dozen vertebræ, very indistinct.\r\n\r\nThe impression of the skull is distinct only in a favorable light, and\r\neven then the boundaries of the cranium are a little uncertain. For this\r\nreason no representation of the form will be attempted. The sculpturing\r\non the parietals is, however, distinct enough to show relationship with\r\nthe previously described specimen, and the form of the body impression,\r\nthe absence of abdominal scutes, the shape of the clavicle and its\r\nsculpture, and the proportions of the hind limbs all agree with the\r\ncharacters which have been assigned to the genus _Tuditanus_. The fragment\r\nof the jaw is interesting as giving the first information as to the\r\ncharacter of the mandible in the genus _Tuditanus_. It is very slender and\r\nof uniform width as far as preserved. The teeth are short, blunt cones,\r\napparently pleurodont.\r\n\r\nThe clavicle is of the typical _Tuditanus_ form, with the sculpturing\r\nlines radiating out from the angle. The impression of the body adds\r\nnothing to that already described for the type specimen. The nearly entire\r\nhind limb is of great interest as adding another example of the phalangeal\r\nformula. The foot is almost perfectly preserved, and the formula was\r\nprobably 2-2-3-3-2. The endochondrium of the limb bones is not highly\r\ndeveloped. About a dozen vertebræ are represented by molds in the soft\r\ncoal, but nothing of their structure can be determined.\r\n\r\nThe sharp, reptile-like claws in which the toes end (fig. 21, B) recall\r\nthose of _Eosauravus_ and of _Tuditanus minimus_ Moodie.

Mus., 37, p. 21, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: _Erpetosaurus radiatus_ Cope.\r\n\r\nSkull stout, elements sculptured with radiating grooves, ridges, and\r\npits; orbits large and usually placed far forward; occiput sometimes\r\nwith posterior table; skull more or less rounded; lateral-line canals\r\nconsisting of supraorbital, suborbital, jugal, and temporal canals,\r\nthe last two uniting to form a circular canal in one species; clavicle\r\ntriangular, sculptured like the skull.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the genus is confined to the skull. The genus was\r\nestablished for certain members of the genus Tuditanus and other forms\r\nwhich have been recently described. The species of the genus are: _E.\r\nradiatus_ Cope type, _E. tabulatus_ Cope, _E. tuberculatus_ Moodie,\r\n_E. obtusus_ Cope, _E. minutus_ Moodie, _E. acutirostris_ Moodie, _E.\r\nsculptilis_ Moodie. All of the species are from the Linton, Ohio, Coal\r\nMeasures, with the exception of _E. sculptilis_ and _E. minutus_, which\r\nare from the Cannelton, Pennsylvania, slates.\r\n\r\nThe position of the genus as to family is a little uncertain, since family\r\ncharacters are not yet well understood among the Carboniferous forms on\r\naccount of the lack of information as to the structure of the animals. If\r\nwe take the absence of the ventral scutellæ as a family character, the\r\ngenus will be in the family Tuditanidæ, but the evidence on this point is\r\nnegative. For the present we may place the genus only provisionally in the\r\nfamily Tuditanidæ. The arrangement will undoubtedly require revision later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Erpetosaurus radiatus Cope, 1874.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc., XV, p. 273, 1874.\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol. Surv.

Cope\r\noriginally described this species from a portion of a skull. He (123)\r\ncharacterized the form as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"The marked character of this form is seen in the very anterior\r\n  position of the orbits and the contraction of the muzzle. The orbits\r\n  are large and are separated by a little more than their own diameter;\r\n  their posterior border is in front of a line measuring the anterior\r\n  third of the length to the supraoccipital crest, and nearly to the\r\n  line marking the fourth of the length to the quadrate region. The\r\n  posterior outline of the skull is deeply concave, the quadrate angle\r\n  projecting beyond the occipital condyles.\"\r\n\r\nThe base of the specimen is broken and there is no place for the occipital\r\ncondyles. Unless the specimen has been mutilated since Cope studied it,\r\nthe occipital condyles are not present.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the skull given in figure 22, B varies but little from\r\nthat given by Cope in 1875. The elements are practically as he represented\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe premaxillæ are small and lie in the usual relations to the other\r\nelements. Minute conical teeth are present as impressions. They are quite\r\nsimilar to the teeth found in other Microsauria. The nasals are nearly\r\nsquare and form the inner boundary of the somewhat oval nostril, which is\r\nrepresented by a depression in the coal. The frontal is elongate. It is\r\nabout twice as long as wide. It forms a portion of the inner border of the\r\norbit, the remainder being made up by the prefrontals and the postfrontal.\r\nThe parietals are the largest elements of the skull, but they do not\r\ngreatly exceed the jugals. Together the parietals form a somewhat obtuse\r\noval in the median region of the skull and they contain between them, in\r\ntheir posterior third, the small circular pineal foramen. The postparietal\r\nforms the posterior boundary of the skull. The pref rental forms the\r\nanterior border of the orbit and is triangular in shape. The lacrimal\r\nis not identified. The maxilla is an elongate element the boundaries of\r\nwhich are uncertain, though probably somewhat as given. The postfrontal\r\nand the postorbital form the posterior boundary of the orbit, inclosing\r\nbetween them the anterior projection of the squamosal. The squamosal is\r\nan elongate element and is acuminate at each end. The tabulare is a large\r\nelement lying lateral to the postparietal. The jugal is a very elongate\r\nelement, apparently acuminate anteriorly. The quadratojugal is small and\r\nelongate. The supratemporal is definitely bounded and its limits are as\r\nindicated (fig. 22, B), being a large element which forms the quadrate angle.\r\n\r\nThere are two other specimens of this species in the collections and a\r\nfragment of a fourth which it is difficult to make out. Cope identified\r\nand figured one of these as _E. radiatus_ (Geol. Surv. Ohio, II, pt. II,\r\npl. 34, fig. 3), but the identification is doubtful and the figure shows\r\nstructures which I am unable to identify in the specimen. Nothing of\r\nimportance is to be learned from the other two specimens, except that they\r\nshow a diversity of size. They consist of incomplete skulls, concerning\r\nwhich Cope (123) remarks:\r\n\r\n  \"There are no mucous canals. The sculpture consists of strong ridges\r\n  radiating and inosculating. Radiation is more uninterrupted on both\r\n  jugal, supratemporal, and anterior part of the tabulare; on the first\r\n  they originate in front of the middle exteriorly; on the supratemporal\r\n  near the anterior part. The inosculation is honeycomb-like on the\r\n  parietal, postfrontal, and posterior parts of the tabulare.\"\r\n\r\nMeasurement of the Type Specimen.\r\n\r\n                                                        mm.\r\n  Length of the skull along median line (estimated)     60\r\n  Length from muzzle to quadrate angle                  71\r\n  Width at posterior border                             69\r\n  Width at orbits                                       40\r\n  Length of orbit                                        9\r\n  Width of orbit                                         8\r\n  Interorbital width                                     8\r\n  Length of nostrils                                     2\r\n\r\nMeasurements of Another Specimen of the Species.\r\n\r\n(No. 8598 G, American Museum of Natural History.)\r\n\r\n                                       mm.\r\n  Median length of skull               56\r\n  Length to quadrate angle             61\r\n  Width at posterior border            50\r\n  Length of orbit                       7\r\n  Width of orbit                        6\r\n  Interorbital width                   4.5\r\n\r\nThe specimens of this species were collected by Dr. J.

It was removed by the writer to the genus\r\n_Erpetosaurus_ in 1909. The species is known from two partially preserved\r\ncrania. The skull elements seem to have disappeared and left only the\r\nimpressions. The sutures are, for the most part, clearly represented, but\r\nthe skull shows no sculpturing. On the posterior third of one cranium\r\nthere is a small space which seems to be slightly sculptured, as Cope\r\nindicated in his drawing. The general form of the skull is that of a\r\nbroad oval, truncate posteriorly. The orbits lie in the anterior third of\r\nthe skull, and the pineal foramen in the posterior third. Cope compared\r\nthe skull to that of Huxley's _Erpetocephalus_, to which it has some\r\nresemblance. The nostrils are elongate and are situated at an obtuse angle\r\nwith relation to the main axis of the skull.\r\n\r\nThe premaxilla is small and forms the inner border of the nostril. There\r\nseem to be impressions of small teeth, but no large ones are evident. The\r\nnasals are separated by a zigzag suture, and are nearly square. They have\r\nthe usual relations. The frontals form a portion of the inner boundary of\r\nthe orbits and unite behind with the parietals, the anterior extensions\r\nof which they inclose. The parietals are large elements and together\r\nform a broad oval, truncate posteriorly. They inclose between them the\r\npineal foramen in the median suture. It lies in the posterior fourth of\r\nthe parietals. The postparietals are elongate transversely, and have the\r\nusual relations. The pref rental is somewhat triangular and forms the\r\nanterior boundary of the orbit. The lacrimal has not been detected. The\r\nmaxilla is elongate, and with the quadrate jugal forms the exterior border\r\nof the cranium. No teeth are observed on the maxilla. The postfrontal and\r\nthe postorbital form the posterior border of the orbit, and between them\r\ninclose the anterior extension of the squamosal. The supratemporal is\r\npointed anteriorly and has the usual relations of that element, joining\r\nthe postorbital, the postfrontal, the parietal, the tabulare, and the\r\nsquamosal. The tabulare is larger than the postparietal and is acuminate,\r\nthe point being inclosed by the squamosal and the supratemporal. The jugal\r\nwidens fan-shaped posteriorly. It forms a portion of the border of the\r\norbit. The supratemporal, as usual, forms the quadrate angle of the skull.\r\nIn front of it lies the elongate quadrate jugal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.\r\n\r\n  A.

I am indebted to\r\nDr. Bashford Dean for the privilege of studying this interesting form. It\r\nis from the Linton deposits of Ohio. The remains include a nearly complete\r\ncranium and a complete clavicle of the right side. The species agrees in\r\nall essential respects with the characters of the genus _Erpetosaurus_,\r\npresenting a broad, flat head and a triangular clavicle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                           PLATE 13\r\n\r\n_Dendrerpeton oweni_ Dawson.

Original specimen in the Peter Redpath Museum of McGill\r\nUniversity.]\r\n\r\nThe cranium is wider than long, the muzzle broadly rounded. The orbits are\r\nwide ovals, and their posterior borders fall little behind the transverse\r\nline dividing the skull equally. The interorbital width equals the long\r\ndiameter of the orbit. The posterior outline of the cranium is truncate\r\nin a straight transverse line between the prominent tabulare angles. The\r\ncomposition of the cranium is different from that of any other species\r\nof _Erpetosaurus_ in the large size of the tabulare and the fact that\r\nthe supratemporal is excluded from the parietal by the extension of\r\nthe postorbitals and the tabulare. This may be a generic character and\r\nentitles the species to be placed in a new genus, but it will be retained\r\nhere until more of the anatomy of the species is known. The elements of\r\nthe anterior part of the skull are not preserved, but they are indicated\r\nby the broken lines in the drawing (fig. 22, G). The nostrils are,\r\nhowever, clearly indicated as bosses of shale. There is a mere fragment\r\nof the nasal preserved posterior to the crack indicated by the transverse\r\nline in the drawing. The frontal is elongate as in other species of the\r\ngenus and forms the inner border of the orbit. The parietal, as usual,\r\nis one of the larger bones of the skull roof and the pineal foramen is\r\ninclosed in the median suture by the two parietal elements. The pineal\r\nopening lies in the posterior half of the parietal. The postparietal is\r\nalmost square, being slightly elongate transversely, uniting laterally\r\nwith the tabulare, with which it forms the truncate table of the skull.\r\nThe suture separating the tabulare from the supratemporal is clearly\r\ndistinct. Although such a position for the supratemporal is unusual it is\r\nnot unique, since the same character has been observed in _Diceratosaurus\r\nlævis_ Moodie, described elsewhere (p. 120) in this paper. The postfrontal\r\nis rather small and it, together with the postorbital, forms the posterior\r\nboundary of the orbit. The postorbital is truncate posteriorly and joins\r\nthe tabulare broadly. The supratemporal lies posterior to the postorbital\r\nand jugal and borders the quadratojugal, which is an unusual condition,\r\nbut what significance the condition has remains to be determined.\r\nPosterior to the supratemporal lies the squamosal, which forms the\r\nquadrate angle of the skull. The quadratojugal is a small element and\r\nforms part of the lateral boundary of the skull. The jugal is a large\r\nelement and forms the entire lateral border of the orbit. There are\r\nno teeth preserved on the fragment of the maxilla, but there are some\r\nimpressions farther forward which resemble the pleurodont denticles of the\r\nmodern Amphibia.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture of the surface of the cranial bones consists of parallel\r\nridges which are separated by grooves equal to them in width. The ridges\r\nradiate inward on the squamosals and f rentals and outward on the\r\nsupratemporals. They are somewhat interrupted on the other skull elements.\r\nThe right clavicle is ornamented with a sculpture of similar radiating\r\ngrooves and ridges.\r\n\r\nCope described an atlas in connection with this skull, but I do not find\r\nit. The slender impressions to the right of the clavicle may possibly\r\nrepresent ribs. They are gently curved and truncate at the inner end.\r\n\r\nA nearly complete system of lateral-line canals has been detected on\r\nthis skull. The canals preserved are: the temporal, the jugal, the\r\ninfraorbital, the occipital cross-commissure, and the supraorbital. These\r\nterms were used for the first time for the Amphibia by the writer (458)\r\nin a discussion of the organs and their significance in the correlation\r\nof the skull elements. The occipital cross-commissure in the present\r\nskull is represented by a row of elongate pits, such as Andrews (8) has\r\ndescribed for _Ceraterpeton galvani_ Huxley from the Coal Measures of\r\nEngland. The cross-commissure is contained within the tabulare. The jugal\r\nand temporal canals form a complete ring, much as the same canals do\r\nin _Trematosaurus_. The supratemporal in _Erpetosaurus tabulatus_ Cope\r\nis excluded from the parietal by the extension of the tabulare and the\r\npostorbital, and it is to be noticed that the temporal canal has a changed\r\nposition to correspond with the changed condition of the squamosal. This\r\nis of considerable interest in connection with the correlation of the\r\nsupratemporal in fishes and amphibians. This subject has been fully\r\ntreated in another place (458) and it will only be necessary to state\r\nhere that on the basis of the lateral-line canals and their arrangement\r\nin fishes and the Amphibia the true correlation of the supratemporal\r\nelements in amphibians and fishes has been made. The temporal canal in the\r\npresent specimen has, apparently, an indication of a connection with the\r\nsupraorbital canal, but of this I am not sure. The jugal canal occurs on\r\nthe supratemporal and quadratojugal, and it joins the infraorbital on the\r\njugal. The infraorbital is indicated by a short portion a few millimeters\r\nlong under the orbit and the remainder, _i.e._, its connection with the\r\njugal canal, is restored (fig. 22, G). There is, nothing unusual to be\r\nobserved in that portion of the infraorbital canal which is preserved. The\r\nsupraorbital canal is indicated by a curved, broad, shallow groove on the\r\ninner side of each orbit. As stated above, there seems to be a connection\r\nbetween this canal and the temporal, but I am not sure. The primitive\r\nconditions shown in the lateral-line canals in _Erpetosaurus tabulatus_\r\nCope are the presence of the occipital cross-commissure and the ring-like\r\nformation of the temporal and jugal canals, which is too clearly indicated\r\nto be overlooked.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Erpetosaurus tabulatus Cope.\r\n\r\n                                                mm.\r\n  Median length of skull                        29\r\n  Width of skull, posterior border, estimated   37\r\n  Width between tabulare angles                 18\r\n  Length of orbit                                8\r\n  Width of orbit                                 6.5\r\n  Diameter of nostril                            1\r\n  Diameter of pineal foramen                     1\r\n  Length of right clavicle                      13\r\n  Width of right clavicle                        5.5\r\n\r\n\r\nMandible Provisionally Associated With Erpetosaurus tabulatus Cope.\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., XXVI, pp. 351-352, pl. lix, fig.\r\n    2; pl. lxiv, fig. 3, 1909.\r\n\r\nThis specimen is preserved almost completely on a slab of soft coal.\r\nIt is impossible to determine positively to what microsaurian species\r\nthe mandible belongs, but it may, for the present, be associated with\r\n_Erpetosaurus tabulatus_ Cope on account of its size and the character\r\nof its sculpture. This is the first and almost the only known example of\r\na mandible of an American microsaurian. The form of the jaw is perfectly\r\npreserved, although the condition of the articular surface can not be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of the mandible, as maybe judged from the table of\r\nmeasurements, are rather stout and the teeth are strong and numerous.\r\nThere are evidences of 19 teeth preserved. The sutures separating the\r\narticular (_art_), angular (_ang_), surangular (_sa_), coronoid (_cor_),\r\nand the dentary (_d_) (fig. 22, F) are clear for at least the greater\r\npart of their length and they may be easily restored for the remainder of\r\ntheir course. The surangular is thus seen to rival the dentary in size\r\nand on it occurs the peculiar sculpturing which approximates so closely\r\nthat on the skull of _Erpetosaurus tabulatus_ Cope. The presence of the\r\nlong anterior tooth is strikingly characteristic of many Microsauria. It\r\nis well developed in _Sauropleura longidentata_ Moodie and _Sauropleura\r\n(Anisodexis) enchodus_ Cope. It is also present in well-developed form\r\nin the later labyrinthodonts. The teeth are all, with the exception of\r\nthe fourth from the anterior end, rather short, curved, and sharply\r\npointed, with an indication of longitudinal fluting. The arrangement of\r\nthe mandibular elements recalls in a striking way the mandible of _Eryops\r\nmegacephalus_ Cope as figured by Branson (49).\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Mandible Provisionally Associated With Erpetosaurus\r\ntabulatus Cope.\r\n\r\n(No. 8542 G, American Museum of Natural History.)\r\n\r\n                                        mm.\r\n  Length of mandible                    32\r\n  Posterior width across surangular      6\r\n  Width of dentary                       3\r\n  Width of jaw at tip                    1.5\r\n  Length of one of the posterior teeth   1.25\r\n  Width across base of same tooth         .50\r\n  Length of long anterior tooth          2\r\n  Width of same tooth at base             .75\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of this same species is 8550 G, of the American Museum.\r\nLinton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALATE OF ERPETOSAURUS TABULATUS COPE.\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., XXVI, pp. 352-354, pl. lxi, fig.\r\n    2, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe specimen is half a cranium with its impression. It is referred to\r\n_Erpetosaurus_ on the basis of the sculpturing of the mandible and the\r\nposterior table of the skull. On the surangular there is seen the rugosity\r\nwhich is common to other members of the genus. The characters presented\r\nare those of _Erpetosaurus tabulatus_ Cope, but the reference is rather\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nThe specimen is unique among the known American material in showing the\r\nstructure of the palate. Jaekel (347) has figured and described the palate\r\nof _Diceratosaurus punctolineatus_ Cope from the Linton beds. The present\r\npalate differs from that species only in the enlarged ectopterygoid and\r\nthe smaller palatine.\r\n\r\nThe parasphenoid, in the present form, does not differ from that element\r\nin other Paleozoic Amphibia. Its form is slender, arising from an enlarged\r\nbase and separating the pterygoids by its own width. The exoccipitals\r\nare probably represented in the specimen and they have been indicated in\r\nthe drawing (fig. 22 C). They are rather large and extend some distance\r\nunder the base of the skull to unite anteriorly with the pterygoids, a\r\nvery unusual arrangement. The pterygoids are elongate elements and are\r\nbounded anteriorly by the vomer and laterally by the ectopterygoid. The\r\nvomer shows no evidence of being toothed, although it may have been so\r\nanteriorly. The same may also be said for the palatines. The relations of\r\nthe ectopterygoids are rather unusual for the Amphibia, especially in the\r\nposterior extension of the element. The bone lies all along the side of\r\nthe pterygoid and anteriorly projects forward between the pterygoid and\r\nthe palatine. In this unusual posterior projection the ectopterygoid has\r\nalmost obliterated the infratemporal foramen, which possibly may be still\r\nrepresented by the triangular space between the bases of the pterygoid\r\nand the ectopterygoid. The anterior palatine foramen (internal nares)\r\nlies between the anterior ends of the palatine and the vomer, its usual\r\nrelations in the labyrinthodonts. The foramen may be recognized as the\r\nrounded depression slightly anterior to the palatine.\r\n\r\nThe mandible is rather heavy and is coarsely sculptured with radiating\r\ngrooves and ridges. The character of the teeth can not be determined, save\r\nto say that they were present. The posterior end of the mandible projects\r\nsomewhat beyond the quadrate angle of the skull.\r\n\r\nThe interest in the present specimen is heightened by the light it throws\r\non the characters for the separation of the Amphibia and Reptilia. The\r\nwide separation of the pterygoids by the parasphenoid is an amphibian\r\ncharacter of undoubted value. The reduction of the parasphenoid in this\r\nspecimen is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Skull of Erpetosaurus tabulatus Cope.\r\n\r\n(No. 8607 G, American Museum of Natural History.)\r\n\r\n                                        mm.\r\n  Length of skull in median line        45\r\n  Estimated posterior width of skull    50\r\n  Estimated width of parasphenoid        6\r\n  Width of pterygoid                     5\r\n  Length of ectopterygoid               17\r\n  Posterior width of mandible           12\r\n\r\n\r\n=Erpetosaurus minutus Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Proc.

National Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Cannelton slates, Pennsylvania (Upper Freeport).\r\n(Plate 20 D.)\r\n\r\nThe specimen on which the species is based is composed of the greater\r\nportion of a small skull preserved in the hard shale from Cannelton,\r\nPennsylvania, and was collected by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston,\r\nPennsylvania. The characters of the specimen had not previously been\r\ndetermined, since the museum label and number had partially obscured the\r\nsnout of the skull. The skull is very small, but has the form assumed by\r\nother members of the genus. The specimen may belong to a young individual,\r\nbut even though it does, it is, nevertheless, quite distinct from the\r\nother species of _Erpetosaurus_. At first sight the specimen looks like a\r\nbroken scute of some larger form. Close inspection, however, revealed the\r\ntwo impressions representing the orbits, and a Zeiss binocular revealed\r\nthe characters. The large size and anterior position of the orbits,\r\nthe character of the sculpturing, the presence of the posterior table\r\nof the skull, as in _Erpetosaurus_ (_Tuditanus_) _tabulatus_ Cope, are\r\nthe characters on which a specific diagnosis is possible. The specific\r\ncharacters which distinguish this form from _E. tabulatus_ Cope, its\r\nnearest ally, are the slight development of the posterior table, the more\r\ndelicate form of the sculpturing, the more posterior position of the\r\norbits, and the varying shape assumed by the parietals in the two species.\r\nAny one of these characters would be valid as a specific character.\r\n\r\nThe pineal eye is indistinct, but is observed to lie in the broken tract\r\nin the median line of the skull, in the middle of the portion posterior to\r\nthe orbits. The interorbital space is equal to the width of the orbit. The\r\norbits themselves are slightly oval and not round, as in the case of _E.\r\ntabulatus_ Cope.\r\n\r\nThe skull elements are sculptured with radiating grooves and ridges, and\r\non the postparietals and tabulare the grooves take the form of pits in a\r\nrow, which undoubtedly represent the occipital cross-commissure of the\r\nlateral-line system first observed in a microsaurian by Andrews (8) in\r\nthe skull of _Ceraterpeton galvani_ Huxley. The supraorbital canal is\r\nrepresented by a slight elongate depression observable over each orbit\r\nand extending, in one case, for about 5 mm. The presence of the circular\r\narrangement of the lateral-line canals in the jugal region is suggested by\r\na depression on the posterior edge of the squamosal.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the skull anterior to the orbits is wanting, curiously\r\nenough, just as in _Erpetosaurus tabulatus_ Cope. In the remainder of the\r\nskull, the post-parietals, the tabulare, the parietals, the supratemporal,\r\nand a portion of the right frontal can be detected, although the\r\nboundaries of but three can be accurately defined. The depression bounding\r\nthe anterior outline of the skull is taken to be the impress of the\r\nmandible, in which case this structure would be of some depth, as in the\r\ncase of the mandible associated with _E. tabulatus_ Cope, described below.\r\n\r\nThis specimen is of interest in respect to the presence of the\r\nlateral-line canals, its small size, and its generic identity with forms\r\nfrom Ohio.

It formed part of the Hall collection acquired by\r\nthe University of Chicago in 1908.\r\n\r\nThe specimen presents only a portion of the skull and fragmentary pectoral\r\nplates. The skull is wider than long and the muzzle is broadly rounded.\r\nThe orbits are narrow ovals and their posterior border falls on the\r\ntransverse line dividing the skull equally. The interorbital width is\r\nslightly greater than the width of the orbits and about equal to their\r\nlength. The posterior outline of the skull is somewhat truncate, as in _E.\r\ntabulatus_ Cope and other species of the genus. The distal extremities of\r\nthe quadrates do not project as far backward as do the supraoccipitals.\r\nThe skull roof is formed of the regular elements, except that a quadrate\r\nseems to be indicated by a scale of bone on the posterior angle. The\r\nnostrils are oval and the pineal opening is small.\r\n\r\nThe premaxillæ are apparently relatively large elements, though their\r\nboundaries are not definite. The nasal is of an oblong shape and borders\r\nthe frontal anteriorly. The frontal forms the whole of the interior border\r\nof the orbit and borders the parietal broadly behind. The parietal is a\r\nlarge element and the pineal foramen is inclosed in the median suture\r\nabout midway of the parietals. The postparietal is wider than long and\r\nwith the tabulare forms the greater part of the posterior border of the\r\nskull. The prefrontal (plate 18, fig. 1) apparently forms the entire\r\nanterior border of the orbit and sends an acuminate projection to the\r\nside of it. The maxilla is excluded from the orbit and is an elongate\r\nelement with sharp conical teeth, of which there are 4 preserved. These\r\nmeasure about 1 mm. in length. The jugal lies along the lateral border\r\nof the orbit and it is acuminate both anteriorly and posteriorly. It\r\nborders the supratemporal broadly. The postfrontal forms the greater part\r\nof the posterior boundary of the orbit. It is triangular and acuminate\r\nbehind, and is bordered broadly by the parietal and supratemporal. The\r\nsupratemporal is also triangular and it borders the parietal broadly.\r\nThe squamosal is evidently the largest element in the skull and on\r\nits posterior corner there is a flake of bone which may represent the\r\nquadrate, though this is by no means certain. The quadrate has not been\r\ndetected in any of the Carboniferous Microsauria so far studied. The\r\ntabulare is an elongate element in the transverse line of the skull. Its\r\nentire boundary is uncertain, though part of the sutures are present. The\r\nquadratojugal is elongate and lies posterior to the maxilla and with that\r\nelement forms the lateral boundary of the skull.\r\n\r\nThe canals of the lateral-line system have not been detected on the skull.\r\nThe sculpturing of the cranial elements consists of grooves and ridges\r\nwhich radiate from a center. They are more prominent on the parietals than\r\nelsewhere, although the other skull elements present a strong sculpturing.\r\n\r\nThere are also preserved on the slab of slate, about 10 mm. posterior to\r\nthe skull, fragments of the pectoral plates, probably representing the\r\nclavicles and the interclavicle. They are so badly fractured that their\r\nform can not be determined. No limbs or vertebræ have been observed.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Erpetosaurus sculptilis Moodie.\r\n\r\n                                    mm.\r\n  Length of skull in median line    20\r\n  Width of skull at posterior\r\n    border (estimated)              24\r\n  Diameter of orbit                  3\r\n  Length of orbit                    4\r\n  Interorbital space                 4\r\n  Diameter of nostril              - 1\r\n  Pineal foramen, diameter            .50\r\n\r\n\r\nPectoral Girdle Provisionally Associated With Erpetosaurus sculptilis\r\nMoodie.\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 37, p. 22, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe present specimen is preserved on a block of slate from Cannelton,\r\nPennsylvania. It is associated with the previously described _Erpetosaurus\r\nsculptilis_ Moodie on account of its size, the geological and geographical\r\ndistribution, and the character of the sculpture. It may pertain to an\r\nunknown species. Other remains besides the 3 elements of the pectoral\r\ngirdle are preserved on the block of slate, but they are, for the most\r\npart, too imperfectly preserved for recognition. Some of them are\r\nphalanges, and I believe I detect a scapula in the rounded curved plate\r\nlying near the right clavicle. The 3 pectoral elements, the interclavicle\r\nand the 2 clavicles, are preserved intact, with the ventral surface\r\nuppermost.\r\n\r\nThe specimen is particularly important in that it furnishes further\r\nevidence of the simplicity of the microsaurian pectoral girdle, which\r\nJaekel regarded (347) as being extremely complex, in one species at\r\nleast, _Diceratosaurus punctolineatus_ Cope. The 3 elements are broken,\r\nbut either the elements or their impressions are present, so that\r\nidentification is possible. The elements are sculptured with radiating\r\ngrooves and ridges, as in so many of the Microsauria. The interclavicle\r\nis spatulate and bears a general resemblance to the same element of\r\n_Metoposaurus fraasi_ Lucas from the Triassic (383) of Arizona. The\r\nclavicles are triangular, with rounded angles and the hypothenuse on the\r\ninterior border.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                           PLATE 14\r\n\r\n  1 and 2.

It is closely allied to\r\n_Erpetosaurus_ (_Tuditanus_) _obtusus_ Cope, from the same beds (Linton,\r\nOhio), but differs from it especially in the position and shape of the\r\norbits and the acute form of the skull. Other characters which amount\r\nalmost to generic significance are found in the posterior prolongation of\r\nthe frontal and in the triangular form of the skull. Only the skull of the\r\nanimal is preserved. The character which is common to all members of the\r\ngenus _Erpetosaurus_, the cranial rugosity, is present in this species on\r\nthe squamosal and supratemporal. This character alone would not, however,\r\nsuffice to separate the form generically, but the general morphology and\r\narrangement of the cranial elements is such that reference to any other\r\ngenus save Erpetosaurus would not be possible.\r\n\r\nThe skull of _E. acutirostris_ takes the form of a rounded triangle. Its\r\nbase is some 50 mm. in extent, and this width gradually narrows to 31 mm.\r\nacross the orbits and still more towards the snout. The form of the skull\r\nis not widely different from that of the type species, _E. radiatus_ Cope,\r\nbut the differences are sufficiently apparent.\r\n\r\nNearly all the elements of the cranium can be detected (fig. 22, D). The\r\nbony portion of the cranium has nearly all been lost, leaving only the\r\nimpression; and the matrix in which the skull was embedded has been forced\r\nup into the sutures between the cranial elements, thus forming ragged\r\nridges where the bones of the skull joined.\r\n\r\nThe position of the nostrils can not be determined accurately. The orbits\r\nare placed well forward, a character common to several species of the\r\ngenus. The interorbital space is equal to the long diameter of the eye.\r\nThe orbits are separated by narrow prolongations of the postfrontals and\r\nby the anterior portion of the frontals. The frontals are remarkable\r\nin their great backward extension. In _E. obtusus_ the frontals are\r\nnearly confined to the interorbital space. The parietals, which, on the\r\nmedian suture, inclose the parietal foramen, lie well posterior, and the\r\nparietals and the tabulare are small. A portion of the sculpturing of\r\nthese elements has been preserved and it is seen to be made up of pits\r\nand elevations much as we find in the skull of _Saurerpeton latithorax_\r\nCope. The left squamosal also shows sculpturing, which here tends to\r\ntake the form of grooves and ridges, and also of pits and elevations. It\r\nis quite probable that the anterior portion of the skull was ornamented\r\nwith grooves and ridges and undoubtedly the lateral-line canals were\r\nwell developed. The postfrontals and the postorbitals are both large\r\nand elongated. The postorbital is especially large. The supratemporal\r\napparently separates the tabulare and the squamosal in their posterior\r\nextremities. The squamosal projects posteriorly to the tabulare and\r\napparently even goes beyond the limits of the exoccipital. The outlines of\r\nthe jugal are fairly definite, as are also the limits of the maxilla.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of the Skull of Erpetosaurus acutirostris Moodie.\r\n\r\n                                mm.\r\n  Length of skull               50\r\n  Interorbital space             9\r\n  Width of orbit                 7\r\n  Length of orbit               10\r\n  Width across orbits           31\r\n  Posterior width of skull      50\r\n  Diameter of pineal foramen     1\r\n  Length from tip of snout to\r\n    posterior angle of skull    65\r\n\r\nAn additional specimen shows that the skull, of which the anterior half\r\nis preserved, is practically of the same size as the type and shows\r\nmuch the same characters, though more extensively. The sculpture of the\r\nsquamosal region is not confined to that portion of the skull, but extends\r\nthroughout the cranial elements, apparently including the premaxillæ.\r\n\r\nThe sutures, which are clearly distinct, are of the same type as has been\r\ndescribed for the type specimen. Perhaps one of the most interesting\r\ncharacters discovered on the present specimen is that of the greater\r\npart of the left supraorbital lateral-line canal, which is exhibited as\r\na rather deep and broad canal running in a slight curve across the lower\r\nedges of the postorbital and the parietals and partly cutting the jugal.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the fossil, as it is preserved, there is an indistinct\r\nimpression of the clavicle, with the sculpture in radiating lines from\r\nthe apex as a center, such as have been found in other species of the\r\nTuditanidæ.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of Additional Specimen.\r\n\r\n(No. 8607, American Museum of Natural History.)\r\n\r\n                                           mm.\r\n  Length of skull as preserved             40\r\n  Anterior width across orbital region     22\r\n  Greatest width of the skull              33\r\n  Length of clavicle                       18\r\n  Greatest width of clavicle                9\r\n\r\nStill a third specimen of this species is possibly represented by a nearly\r\ncomplete skull of a small individual which exposes the mandible and the\r\nventral portion of the skull. The remains are crushed flat, though not at\r\nall distorted. It is quite possible that the present specimen represents\r\na distinct species, but only a small portion of the dorsum is present and\r\nthe shape of the cranium is indistinct, so it is retained in this species.\r\nThe portion of the skull shows the sculpture to be quite similar to that\r\nof _Erpetosaurus acutirostris_, so far as the species is known; and the\r\nskull apparently tapers to a point anteriorly. It may be a dwarfed or\r\nimmature form. The sculpturing of the jaw is such as we would expect of\r\nthis species.\r\n\r\nThe specimen is about half the size of the type. The palate of the skull\r\nis well preserved and is extremely interesting. The sutures separating\r\nthe various palatal elements are not distinct. The parasphenoid is\r\nespecially large and the exoccipitals are partly ossified, if we may judge\r\nby the projecting condyles. Anteriorly the parasphenoid contracts and\r\nthen expands and on each side of the expanded part lie fragments of the\r\npalatines. To the right of the posterior end of the parasphenoid lies a\r\nportion of the dorsal element showing the cranial sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe left mandible is somewhat displaced to the right of the skull, and\r\ncrushed and weathered to such an extent that the sutures are entirely\r\nobliterated. There are 3 teeth, with indications of others. They are\r\ntypically pleurodont and sharp and slender. The mandible tapers somewhat\r\nanteriorly and at the tip bears an elongate enlarged tooth.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Third Specimen of Erpetosaurus acutirostris Moodie in\r\nthe American Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\n                                         mm.\r\n  Length of skull, as preserved          25\r\n  Posterior width of skull               15\r\n  Anterior width of skull                10\r\n  Width across occipital condyles         4\r\n  Length of mandible                     25\r\n  Anterior width of mandible              2\r\n  Length of large tooth                   1\r\n\r\n\r\n=Erpetosaurus tuberculatus Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Bull.

Its\r\nassociation in the genus is solely on the character of the sculpturing\r\nof the cranial elements. It is most closely related, in the characters\r\npreserved, to the form described by Cope as _Tuditanus radiatus_, from\r\nwhich it differs especially in the character of the sculpture and in\r\nthe position of the orbits, as well as the arrangement and size of the\r\nvarious cranial elements, so far as these elements can be detected in the\r\npresent specimen. In _Erpetosaurus radiatus_ the skull is sculptured by\r\nradiating grooves and ridges which did not arise from a definite center.\r\nIn _E. tuberculatus_ this center of radiation is marked by an elevation\r\nor tubercle on each cranial element exposed, from which the grooves and\r\nridges radiate outward. These tubercles have an elevation of 4 mm. above\r\nthe cranial element proper. The orbit is located near the median line of\r\nthe skull, so far as can be determined. In _E. radiatus_ Cope the orbits\r\nare located well forward. In that species also the postparietal is smaller\r\nthan in the present species and the squamosal is longer and more slender.\r\n(Plate 25, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe fragment of a skull on which the above comparison has been made\r\nconsists of the right postparietal, a portion of the tabulare, the\r\nparietal, the frontal, and a portion of the squamosal. The other elements\r\nare not clear. The elements in the median line are elongate, as in\r\n_Erpetosaurus radiatus_. The pineal foramen is located well back on\r\nthe median line and lies posterior to two-thirds of the length of the\r\nparietals. The sutures separating the frontal and parietal elements from\r\neach other in the median line are of the zigzag form so characteristic of\r\nthe labyrinthodonts.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Erpetosaurus tuberculatus Moodie.\r\n\r\n                                             mm.\r\n  Length of portion of skull preserved       52\r\n  Width across tabulare (estimated)          60\r\n  Length of parietal                         15\r\n  Maximum width of parietal                  11\r\n  Length of frontal                          22\r\n  Width of frontal                           12\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus ODONTERPETON Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Proc.

The name of the genus is derived from the remarkable size of\r\nthe teeth as compared with the size of the skull.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Odonterpeton triangularis Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 37, p. 19, pl. 6, fig. 3, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 4465, U. S. National Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe specimen described under the above name is a representative of the\r\nsmallest species of the Microsauria so far described from North America.\r\n_Orthocosta microscopica_ Fritsch, from the Carboniferous of Bohemia,\r\nis a rival of the present form in size, but the form described by\r\nFritsch is an entirely different animal and was formerly included among\r\nthe so-called Aistopoda, which are regarded by the writer as merely\r\nspecialized microsaurians. The present form shows clear affinities with\r\nthe Microsauria.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen by referring to the list of measurements, the skull of this\r\nform measures only 6.5 mm. in length. The form may possibly be larval,\r\nthough I do not think so, if I may judge from the well-developed condition\r\nof the skull bones and the complete ossification of the vertebræ. The\r\nsides of the skull are equal and the occiput is a straight table, so that\r\nthe skull forms almost an exact equilateral triangle. The orbits are very\r\nsmall and are placed well forward. The interorbital space is four times\r\nthat of the diameter of the orbit, a very unusual character and in itself\r\nworthy of ranking as a generic character. The median suture of the skull\r\nis zigzag and incloses the minute parietal foramen near the posterior\r\nend of the skull. The relations of the elements of the skull, with the\r\nexceptions of those of the frontals and parietals, can not be determined\r\nwith accuracy, although there are here and there indications of sutures.\r\nThe characters of the cranial elements, so far as they can be determined,\r\nare those of the family Tuditanidæ, and the form may, for the present, be\r\nregarded as a member of that group. The teeth are very long, slender, and\r\nsharp, and are placed close together. There is no indication of fluting on\r\nthe teeth. They are slightly curved inward.\r\n\r\nThere are 13 vertebræ present. The centra are hour-glass shaped, and are\r\napparently phyllospondylous, with the notochord largely persistent. The\r\nvertebral centra are unusually long and slender, with the ends rounded.\r\nThe humerus of the right side is preserved. It is a long, slender bone\r\nwith expanded extremities. There is no evidence of abdominal armature nor\r\nof ribs (fig. 22, E).\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this form in the Linton deposits is of considerable\r\ninterest in that it indicates a wide range in size and character of the\r\nfauna of the time. The forms now known from the Linton beds range from\r\nOdonterpeton, which possibly had a total length of 2 inches in life, to\r\nthe form designated _Macrerpeton huxleyi_ Cope, with a skull of at least 8\r\ninches in length and whose body may have attained a length of some feet.\r\nThe large rib described below undoubtedly indicates a large form of the\r\nancient Amphibia from Linton, as do also the vertebræ described by Marsh\r\nin 1863 from Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type.\r\n\r\n                                    mm.\r\n  Length of animal, as preserved    18\r\n  Length of skull                    6.5\r\n  Posterior width of skull           5.5\r\n  Length of side of skull            6.5\r\n  Diameter of orbit                 65\r\n  Interorbital width                 2\r\n  Length of tooth                    0.25\r\n  Length of vertebra                 1.45\r\n  Width of vertebra                 35\r\n  Length of humerus                  2.25\r\n  Distal width of humerus           35\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSAURIAN FAMILY STEGOPIDÆ, FROM THE COAL MEASURES OF OHIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Family STEGOPIDÆ Moodie, 1909.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour. Geol., XVII, No. 1, 79, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe chief family characters are the large lacrimal, unknown in other\r\nspecies of Coal Measures Amphibia, the central position of the orbits, the\r\ngeneral form of the skull, and the peculiar, short, divaricate horns from\r\nthe squamosal. If an intertemporal element is present in the skull, which\r\nis suggested as a possibility, the family is further distinct. The type\r\nspecies is Stegops divaricata Cope from the Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe group seems to be distinct and has no immediate allies, being confined\r\nto the American Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus STEGOPS Moodie, 1909.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour. Geol., XVII, 79, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: _Stegops divaricata_ Cope.\r\n\r\nThis genus has been erected for the reception of the peculiar form\r\ndescribed by Cope as _Ceraterpeton divaricatum_, but there are good\r\nreasons why the form can not be retained in the genus. The position of\r\nthe orbits in Stegops (plate 25, fig. 3) is different from _Ceraterpeton_\r\nand the muzzle is rounded, not truncate as in the latter form. The horns\r\nare of a different type and there is no indication of the tabulare\r\nprotuberance which is present in _Ceraterpeton_. The sculpturing of the\r\ncranial elements is also distinctive in the present form, consisting of\r\nradiating grooves and ridges; the cranium of _Ceraterpeton_ appears to be\r\nbut slightly sculptured. There is no lateral projection from the border of\r\nthe skull in Stegops, as there is in the other genus. The structure of the\r\nskull of _Ceraterpeton_ is practically unknown, except in a very general\r\nway, although Andrews (8) was able to make out some of the elements and to\r\ntrace the lateral-line canals. A structural comparison is thus impossible,\r\nbut on the basis of form alone there are good generic distinctions. The\r\npresent genus is apparently distinct from other genera in the presence\r\nof an intertemporal, but additional material will be required before\r\na satisfactory determination is possible. The genus _Diceratosaurus_\r\nof Jaekel (347) is distinct in the arrangement of the elements of the\r\ncranium, the general form of the skull, and in the two known species of\r\n_Diceratosaurus_ the orbits are located well anteriorly, but in Stegops\r\nthey are in the median transverse line of the cranium. The genus _Stegops_\r\nis distinct from _Eoserpeton_ in the smaller size of the prosquamosal,\r\nin the broadly rounded muzzle, in the larger and more posteriorly placed\r\norbits, and in the presence of an intertemporal bone, or at least in the\r\nelongate character of the postorbital if the intertemporal is not present.\r\nThe species on which the genus Eoserpeton is based was first described by\r\nCope as Ceraterpeton ten n iconic. The form is quite distinct, in spite\r\nof Jacket's protestations to the contrary. The genus _Stegops_ stands\r\nalone among the Carboniferous Amphibia of North America, so far as I am\r\naware, in the possession of a well-defined lacrimal of the labyrinthodont\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stegops divaricata Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc.

The obverse\r\nof this is No. 12,311, Walker Museum, University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe skull on which this species is based consists of the impressions\r\non two slabs of coal, one belonging to the Newberry Collection of the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, No. 2559 G, and the other to the\r\nGurley Collection of the University of Chicago, No. 12,311. The slab\r\nbelonging to the University of Chicago contains the better-preserved\r\nremains, so that the description is based largely on that portion (plate\r\n25, fig. 3). Nearly all of the elements of the skull are determined with\r\nconsiderable certainty and many important characters in the morphology of\r\nthe Microsauria are thus brought out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Skull elements of _Stegops divaricata_ Cope.,\r\n_fr_, frontal; _it_, intertemporal; _j_, jugal; _la_, lacrimal;\r\n_mx_, maxilla; _n_, nasal; _par_, parietal; _pf_, prefrontal; _po_,\r\npostorbital; _pof_, postfrontal; _pmx_, premaxilla; _sq_, squamosal; spt,\r\nsupratemporal; _qj_, quadratojugal; _tab_, tabulare; _pp_, postparietal. ×\r\n1.3.]\r\n\r\nThe skull is oval, elongate, truncate behind, and the quadrate angles\r\nproject into sharp horns. The orbits are elongate ovals and their center\r\nlies in the median line which divides the skull transversely. The nostrils\r\nare elongate and have an oblique position. The pineal foramen lies in the\r\nposterior third of the skull.\r\n\r\nTeeth are preserved on both maxillæ and premaxillæ. They are simply sharp\r\npleurodont denticles, and seem to have been fairly abundant. The bones\r\nhave been completely carbonized and nothing of the original texture\r\nis preserved, although the details of the structure are beautifully\r\npreserved. (Plate 25, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe skull is somewhat triangular in its general form. The premaxilla lies\r\non the anterior border of the cranium, and forms the median border of\r\nthe nostril. The suture which separates the maxilla and the premaxilla\r\nis not evident, and it may not be correctly defined in the figure (fig.\r\n23). The nasal is a very large element and is elongate. It unites with\r\nthe premaxilla, the lacrimal, the prefrontal, and the parietal. It\r\nis acuminate behind and the point is inclosed by the pref rental and\r\nthe parietal. The frontal is quite narrow and elongate, and does not\r\nborder the orbit; its posterior boundary is not accurately represented.\r\nThe radiations on the surface indicate the extent of the element. The\r\nparietals are remarkable in being smaller than the frontal and nasal. The\r\npineal foramen is inclosed in the median suture in the anterior third of\r\nthe parietals. The parietal has the usual relations of that element. The\r\npostparietal lies posterior to the parietal, but a portion of its bounding\r\nsutures are destroyed. The prefrontal forms the antero-interior border of\r\nthe orbit and borders the postfrontal posteriorly, in an unusual manner.\r\nThe lacrimal is a large element and is clearly separable from the other\r\ncranial elements. It, with the prefrontal, forms the anterior border of\r\nthe orbit. The maxilla is very elongate and forms the larger part of the\r\nlateral border of the skull. Sharp-pointed teeth are present on it and\r\nthey may have been pleurodont. The lateral border of the orbit probably\r\nreceived a portion of the maxilla. The postfrontal and the postorbital\r\nform the greater part of the posterior boundary of the orbit. The\r\npostorbital seems to be divided by a median suture which would indicate an\r\nintertemporal bone, but this is not certain. The appearance may be due to\r\na fracture. The supratemporal is a large element bordering the parietal\r\nand lies in front of the tabulare. The squamosal is elongate to form the\r\nposterior horn-like extension of the skull. The tabulare is transversely\r\nelongate and has the usual relations. The jugal widens to a fan-shape\r\nbackwards, and helps to form the lateral border of the orbit. Its lateral\r\nand anterior boundaries are not assured. The quadratojugal seems to lie as\r\nindicated, although the anterior part of the suture is not distinct. It\r\nis apparently an elongate element and with the maxilla forms the lateral\r\nborder of the skull. The base of the skull as restored (fig. 23) is\r\nirregular and may have had a slightly different form.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Stegops_ is exceptional in the elongate character of the\r\ncranial elements of the single species known. In this respect it recalls\r\nthe species _Diceratosaurus lævis_ described below. The large size of the\r\nnasals, frontals, and lacrimals and the small size of the parietals are,\r\nso far as I am aware, unparalleled among the other Coal Measures Amphibia\r\nof North America.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type.\r\n\r\n                                   mm.\r\n  Median length of the skull       56\r\n  Width across tips of horns       46\r\n  Width at base of horns           40\r\n  Width across orbits              44\r\n  Diameter of the orbit             8\r\n  Length of the orbit              15\r\n  Interorbital space               16\r\n  Length of the nostril             2\r\n  Diameter of the pineal foramen    1\r\n  Length of the teeth               1.5\r\n  Length of the horn from base      7.5\r\n  Width of horn at base             4\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                           PLATE 15\r\n\r\n  1.

Geol., XVII, pp. 63-69, figs. 13-15, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: _Diceratosaurus punctolineatus_ Jaekel.\r\n\r\n  Orbits in the anterior two-thirds of the axial skull length, nostrils\r\n  near to the anterior end of the skull; pineal foramen in the center\r\n  of the skull roof; skull provided with tabulate cornua and a broad\r\n  backwardly directed process; quadrate angle does not project on the\r\n  border of the skull; sculpture of the cranial elements impressed as\r\n  radial grooves; 12 presacral vertebræ, 1 sacral with expanded neural\r\n  spine which is sculptured at the top, with simple long, apparently\r\n  separately ossified transverse processes; extremities small; foot with\r\n  5 digits; phalangeal formula 2-3-3-4-3.\r\n\r\nThe most important differences between _Diceratosaurus_ and\r\n_Ceraterpeton_, the most nearly allied genus, is (in _Diceratosaurus_)\r\nin the more anterior position and small size of the orbits, the backward\r\nextension of the quadrate region, and the dorsal expansion of the\r\nvertebral spines. A further, and more important, difference between the\r\ngenera is in the location of the backwardly directed processes from the\r\nskull. In Ceraterpeton they project backward from and are a portion of the\r\ntabulare element, while in Diceratosaurus the projection consists almost\r\nentirely of squamosal and supratemporal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diceratosaurus punctolineatus Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc. Phila. Acad. Nat. Sci., 1875, p. 16.\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol. Surv. Ohio, II, pt. II, p. 372, pl. xli, fig. 4, 1875.\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., XXVI, art.

It was redescribed on more abundant material (plate 19) by Jaekel\r\n(347), and the following is taken from the discussions of these two\r\nauthors, checked by my own observations on the type specimen. This shows\r\na portion of the skull, consisting of the squamosal and supratemporal\r\nwith a projecting, convergent horn. The sculpturing on the skull is\r\nsimilar to that on the pectoral plates, of which there are three preserved\r\n(plate 14, fig. 4). The bones of the fore limbs are stout and short. The\r\nribs are only slightly curved. The character of the vertebræ can not be\r\nascertained. The sculpturing of the bones consists of radiating ridges,\r\ngrooves, and pittings.\r\n\r\nJaekel (347) described from the museum collection at Berlin 3 specimens of\r\nthis species, among which were 2 skulls. There were associated with these\r\nremains some pectoral plates and limb bones with a nearly complete series\r\nof vertebræ. A modified translation of Jaekel's description follows:\r\n\r\nThe skull of the largest specimen has, including the horns, a length of 35\r\nmm. and a width of 30 mm. on the occipital border. From the anterior end\r\nto the posterior border of the skull (exclusive of the horns) there is a\r\nlength of 25 mm. The pineal foramen lies about midway of this length. The\r\norbits are rather large, almost circular, and lie about midway between the\r\npineal foramen and the anterior border of the skull. The nostrils, which\r\nlie anterior to the orbits, are a rather oblique oval and narrowed on the\r\nlateral ends. The distance between them is about the same as that between\r\nthe orbits, which measures 7 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                           PLATE 16\r\n\r\n  1.

The bones of the middle\r\nof the skull (that is, the parietals, frontals, premaxillæ, nasals, and\r\npostparietals) are of the normal form and only show an unusual difference\r\nin that they are large in the inverse order. The pineal foramen lies in\r\nthe anterior third of the parietals; that is the primitive condition\r\nwhich occurs in the young forms of the Branchiosauridæ. The nostrils are\r\ninclosed by the premaxillæ in front, in the median line by the nasals and\r\nlaterally by the maxillæ. The jugals, by their backward prolongation,\r\nform, behind the maxillæ, the border of the skull, and only attain to some\r\nsize on the upper side of the cranium.\r\n\r\nJaekel's \"perisquamosal\" (see plate 15), which is of a doubtful nature, is\r\nnot indicated in the type specimen nor in the specimens of the other two\r\nspecies (462) assigned to this genus. In _D. robustus_ and _D. lævis_ the\r\n\"perisquamosal\" region is easily separable into its component elements.\r\nThe sutures between the elements may have been indistinct in his specimen,\r\nbut it is hardly conceivable that a union of the skull bones would occur\r\nin one species and not in another of the same genus. Jaekel's suggestion\r\n(347) that \"Etwas mehr Wahrscheinlichkeit möchte ich der Vorstellung\r\nbeimessen, dass diese Ausbreitungen zum Schutz freier Kiemen dienten, wie\r\nsie z. B. bei den Perennibranchiaten als baumförmige Organe weit am Halse\r\nherausragen\" can hardly find acceptance with students of the Paleozoic\r\nAmphibia, since there is not the slightest evidence that the Microsauria\r\never possessed external gills and considerable presumptive evidence that\r\nthey did not. His comparison of the \"perisquamosal\" to the \"Kiemendeckel\"\r\nof the fishes is also very unhappy on morphological grounds, since the\r\nelements of his \"perisquamosal\" form constituent parts of the skull roof,\r\nwhich the operculum never does.\r\n\r\nThe palate of the skull (plate 15, fig. 2) has been determined by removing\r\nthe skull bones of one specimen. Anteriorly the premaxillæ and maxillæ\r\nare clearly recognizable as large dentiferous elements. The premaxillæ\r\nhave 4 to 7 teeth, the short maxilla has 3 to 4. All the teeth are of\r\nnearly equal size. Smaller teeth seem to be indicated by impressions found\r\nbetween the larger ones. The vomers, which are tolerably large, unite with\r\nthe premaxillæ behind and inclose at least half of the palatine foramen on\r\nthe inner side. They are furnished with small teeth, which in the anterior\r\npart are very irregularly placed, but they are more regular posteriorly.\r\n\r\nThe palatines and transverse bones are questionably identified. They\r\nseem to lie posterior and lateral to the vomers, but the sutures are\r\nindistinct. The large parasphenoid seems well displayed and is more or\r\nless heart-shaped. There would seem to be a slight indication of double\r\noccipital condyles. The pterygoids are broad plates which inclose the\r\nparasphenoid and form the lateral boundary of the palate. The cotyli are\r\nvery indistinct, but appear as elongate grooves.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral girdle (plate 15, fig. 3) consists, apparently, of seven\r\nelements, three paired and one unpaired. The unpaired element (the\r\ninterclavicle) is truncate posteriorly and acuminate in front, with its\r\nsurface radially grooved and the anterior borders beveled for articulation\r\nwith the clavicles. The clavicles are triangular, as is usual with the\r\nMicrosauria. They are sculptured with radiate grooves and ridges, with\r\ndecided inosculations at the ossific center. The coracoids have only\r\npart of their surface ornamented; most of their surface is smooth for\r\narticulation with the interclavicle and scapula. A long spine projects\r\nfrom the inner surface of the coracoid. A pair of small elements lie one\r\non either side of the clavicles and Jaekel (347) interprets them as the\r\ncleithra. If they are cleithra they are unique among the Microsauria.\r\nThe pectoral girdle does not, however, indicate that _Diceratosaurus_ is\r\n\"unique among all known quadrupeds.\"\r\n\r\nJaekel regards the limb which is preserved with the material as an arm\r\n(plate 15, fig. 4), but there is no reason stated for his conclusion. It\r\nhas all of the characters of the leg and may be regarded as such. Only\r\na part of the lower end of the femur is preserved. The tibia and fibula\r\nare preserved as separate rod-like elements with one of the bones longer\r\nand larger, probably the tibia. There are 5 toes which have the customary\r\nphalangeal formula for a microsaurian foot of 2-3-3-4(?)-3. The tarsals\r\nare unossified.\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ (plate 15) were perforated for the notochord, and are\r\nhour-glass-shaped, with the neural arch thickened to support a heavy\r\nspine which bore a sculptured plate. These apical plates occur in the\r\ndorsal region, but diminish toward the caudal vertebræ. The number of the\r\nvertebræ in the dorsal region is very small and in the tail very large.\r\nThere are possibly 2 vertebræ in the cervical, 11 in the dorsal series;\r\nthe thirteenth carries the pelvis. There are over 100 vertebræ in the tail.\r\n\r\nThe ribs have an expanded head and the transverse processes of the\r\nvertebræ are long.\r\n\r\nThe following account is based on the writer's study of the type specimen\r\nand he is able to add several points of interest to a knowledge of the\r\nanatomy of the type of this interesting microsaurian.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen consists of 11 consecutive vertebræ with a portion of\r\nthe skull, the greater portion of the pectoral girdle, parts of both\r\nfore limbs, ribs, and ventral scutellæ (plate 14, fig. 4). The species\r\nis represented in the collection by yet another specimen, on which Cope\r\nbased his _Tuditanus mordax_ (plate 22, fig. 5), of which he himself says:\r\n\"Further examination of the specimen on which the latter (_T. mordax_)\r\nwas founded leads to the belief that it is an imperfect cranium of\r\n_Ceraterpeton (Diceratosaurus) punctolineatum_ Cope.\" The plates referred\r\nto are rather to be regarded as elements of the pectoral girdle and I\r\nbelieve they represent the clavicle and a portion of the interclavicle.\r\n\r\nThe skull of the present species is fully described by Jaekel. The\r\ntype specimen does not offer any evidence in support of Jaekel's\r\n\"perisquamosal,\" but rather tends to the idea that he is incorrect in his\r\nassumption of the fusion of these elements of the skull. The direction\r\ntaken by the ridges and grooves on the elements preserved indicate a\r\nseparation between the supratemporal and the squamosal. I do not find\r\nthat the grooves have the tendency to arise from a common center of\r\nossification in the squamosal, as suggested in the figures of Jaekel.\r\nThe horn which projects backward from the squamosal is rather large and\r\nheavy for the size of the skull, and after curving slightly inward ends\r\nin a blunt point and not sharply, as Jaekel figures in his specimens. The\r\nvertebral column is indistinctly preserved and I have nothing to add to\r\nJaekel's account given above.\r\n\r\nIn the structure of the pectoral girdle my results are greatly at variance\r\nwith those of Jaekel. I do not find the remarkable elements which Jaekel\r\nhas figured (347) in his specimens. On the other hand, I find a normal\r\nmicrosaurian pectoral arch (464), such as has been described for numerous\r\nother forms. There are present, distinctly preserved in the type specimen,\r\nthe scapulæ, the clavicles, and the interclavicle, with the possibility\r\nof the coracoid. The peculiar element referred to by Cope as resembling a\r\n\"lacertilian pubis\" is without doubt the left scapula of the animal (plate\r\n16, fig. 1). Its form compares very favorably with that of _Ceraterpeton_\r\nas figured by Woodward (630). The coracoid may be represented by the\r\nfragment which lies close to the scapula. The sculptured element lying\r\nnext to the supratemporal horn of the skull is the right clavicle\r\npreserved bottom side up. Of the other two sculptured elements, one is the\r\ninterclavicle, only a portion of which is preserved. The left clavicle\r\nlies beside it. The clavicles in this species have a tendency to assume\r\nthe triangular shape so common in other species of Microsauria, and the\r\ninterclavicle, so far as can be determined, was shield-shaped. The upper\r\nsurfaces of the pectoral elements are marked by grooves for the attachment\r\nof the pectoral muscles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.\r\n\r\n  A.

The scutæ are oat-shaped and take the usual\r\nform. The ribs are not long, are rather stout, and beyond the proximal\r\ncurve are nearly straight to the obtuse tips. The heads of the ribs are so\r\nobscure that it is impossible to determine whether they were two-headed\r\nor not. They are expanded proximally and there is a slight tendency to a\r\ndivision of the head.\r\n\r\nPortions of both fore limbs are preserved. The right limb possesses the\r\nhumerus, separate radius and ulna, and 2 metacarpals. The other possesses\r\nonly the radius, 3 metacarpals, and a portion of a phalanx. The humerus is\r\na very stout bone and at once recalls that of _Amblyrhynchus_. The ends\r\nare expanded and there are roughnesses on the bone for the attachment of\r\nmuscles. The radius and ulna are subequal in size. They are both expanded\r\nmore proximally than distally. The carpus was cartilaginous. An additional\r\nspecimen of this species is figured on plate 16, fig. 5.

Geol., XVII, No. 1, p. 63, figs. 13, 14, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 102 (8680 G), American Museum of Natural History, where\r\nit forms part of the Newberry collection.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe species is represented by an almost complete skull, which had been\r\nidentified previously by Cope as _Tuditanus radiatus_. The specimen\r\nconsists of the impressions of the bones of the cranial roof, the bones\r\nthemselves having disappeared. It is not probable that the dorsum of the\r\nskull was smooth. The details in the structure of the skull have been\r\nascertained quite definitely. There can be no doubt that the arrangement\r\nof the elements is accurate, as shown in figure 24 A. The supratemporal,\r\nas in _Erpetosaurus tabulatus_ Cope, is excluded from the parietal.\r\n\r\nThe form of the skull at once recalls that of the species _D.\r\npunctolineatus_, as figured by Jaekel (see plate 15). The orbits are\r\nlocated in nearly the same region of the skull and the sutures separating\r\nthe cranial elements are quite similar in the anterior portions. The\r\nspecies _D. lævis_ is based on the divergent character of the horn-like\r\nprotuberances which project from the squamosals. The horns of _D.\r\npunctolineatus_ are convergent. The present skull is also smaller and the\r\nparietals in _D. lævis_ are much larger than in the type species. In the\r\ntype species, also, the pineal foramen is located well forward in the\r\nparietal, while in the present form the foramen is located well posterior.\r\n\r\nThe skull is almost rectangular. The nostrils are elongate ovals. The\r\norbits are circular and the distance between them is equal to two-thirds\r\nof the dimensions of the orbit. They are located well forward in the skull\r\nand are bounded laterally by the maxillaries. The nostrils have much the\r\nsame character as in the type form, being broadly oval.\r\n\r\nThe premaxillæ are elongate transversely, being about twice as long as\r\nwide. They are identical in shape and relations with the same elements\r\nin _D. punctolineatus_ Cope. The nasal is nearly square and forms\r\nthe interior boundary of the nostril. The frontal is elongate in the\r\nmedian length of the skull and it is acuminate posteriorly, where the\r\nacumination is inclosed by the parietal and postfrontal. The parietals are\r\nby far the largest elements in the cranium. They form together an oval\r\nwhich is elongate in the longitudinal diameter of the skull. They inclose\r\nbetween them, in the median suture, the small pineal foramen. They are\r\nacuminate in front, with a broad truncate posterior base, where they are\r\nbounded by the postparietals. The postparietal is nearly square, being\r\nsomewhat wider than long. It joins the tabulare and the parietal. The\r\ntabulare is elongate in the long diameter of the skull. It ends anteriorly\r\nin a point which is inserted between the postorbital and the parietal, and\r\nbears a short protuberance posteriorly, much as does the same element in\r\nthe type species.\r\n\r\nThere are four elements which take part in the formation of the posterior\r\nborder of the skull. These are the postparietal, the tabulare, the\r\nsquamosal, and the supratemporal. It is very unusual for the supratemporal\r\nto reach the posterior edge of the cranium. The pref rental lies anterior\r\nto the orbit, of which it forms the anterior border. The lacrimal has not\r\nbeen detected, although Jaekel (347) has indicated it in his drawings\r\nof the skull of the type species. The maxilla is elongate and forms the\r\nlateral border of the skull. No teeth have been detected, although they\r\nwere doubtless the same as Jaekel has figured in _D. punctolineatus_.\r\nThe jugal is an elongate element joining the maxilla posteriorly. Jaekel\r\nincluded this element in his \"perisquamosal,\" but the sutures are clearly\r\nevident in the present specimen and there is no evidence of a structure at\r\nall similar to a \"perisquamosal.\" The postorbital is fully as large as the\r\njugal which it joins, forming a part of the posterior border of the orbit\r\nand ending posteriorly in a point which is inclosed by the tabulare and\r\nthe squamosal. The postfrontal with the foregoing element forms the entire\r\nposterior border of the orbit and it likewise ends in a point inclosed\r\nby the parietal and the postorbital. The quadratojugal has much the same\r\nshape and relations as in _D. punctolineatus_, although it is located\r\nfurther back. The squamosal is also elongate, as are most of the posterior\r\ncranial elements, and it also has an acumination which is directed forward\r\nand is inclosed by the postorbital and jugal. The anterior suture of this\r\nelement is rather indistinct, but it is, I believe, as represented (fig.\r\n24). The element is elongate and is prolonged posteriorly to form the\r\nhorn, which ends in a blunt point and is not sharp, as in the type species.\r\n\r\nJaekel (347) regards the species _Diceratosaurus punctolineatus_ Cope\r\nas being unparalleled among known vertebrates in the possession of a\r\n\"perisquamosal\" element. In closely allied species the \"perisquamosal\" is\r\neasily separated into its component elements, and the morphology of the\r\npresent skull would throw considerable doubt on Jaekel's interpretation\r\nof the skull of the type species. Another specimen, described below as\r\nanother species of this genus, shows no evidence of this fusion. So far as\r\nI can learn, there have been no cases of true fusion of cranial elements\r\ncorrectly reported, unless it be that which possibly exists between the\r\ntwo frontals in the skull of _Diplocaulus_. It was on the basis of such\r\nfusions that Maggi (397) proposed to derive the interparietals of the\r\nprimates from the tabulare of the stegocephalians.\r\n\r\nThe posterior outline of the skull in the present specimen is not well\r\npreserved and the outline as given may be slightly inaccurate. The\r\nindentation figured by Jaekel in the posterior border of the skull of the\r\ntype form is not present in the species under discussion.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type Skull of Diceratosaurus lævis Moodie.\r\n\r\n                                              mm.\r\n  Length of skull along median suture         37\r\n  Length from muzzle to tip of horn           50\r\n  Width between tips of horns, estimated      40\r\n  Width of orbit                               7\r\n  Length of orbit                             10\r\n  Width of skull across the orbits            30\r\n  Interorbital width                           6\r\n  Length of nostril opening                    2\r\n  Width of nostril                             1\r\n  Diameter of the pineal foramen             - 1\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diceratosaurus robustus Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour.

The presence of horns\r\nas given in the restoration of the skull (fig. 24, B) is based on the\r\nanalogy with the other two species of this genus, in both of which horns\r\nare present. The generic determination of the species is based on the\r\nlarge size of the postorbital, which is essentially characteristic of the\r\nother species of _Diceratosaurus_.\r\n\r\nThe characters which distinguish the species from others of the genus are\r\nthe large postorbitals and the small parietals, which are excluded from\r\nunion with the postfrontals on account of the large size of the frontal.\r\nIn the other two known species the frontal is small and the parietal comes\r\nforward to join the postfrontal. The present species exhibits a skull\r\nwhich is nearly twice as large as that of _D. lævis_ and nearly three\r\ntimes the size of the skull of _D. punctolineatus_.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the skull preserved shows the cranium to have had a rather\r\nacuminate snout, not blunt as in the type species. The orbit is an\r\nelongate oval, although it has the same relative position in the skull\r\nas in the other species. The nostril is indicated by an oval depression\r\nnear the anterior edge of the skull. The frontals, as indicated by the\r\nsutures present on the portion of the skull which is preserved, are fully\r\nas long as the parietals. Whether they were as wide as is represented is\r\nuncertain. The postfrontals are very small bones, the sutures of which are\r\nsomewhat uncertain, although they can not be far from what is represented\r\n(fig. 24, B). The postorbital is large and elongate, and is distinctive of\r\nthis species on account of its unusual size, although it does not attain\r\nthe same proportions as in other members of the genus. The parietals are\r\nelongate and narrow. The pineal foramen is represented by its lateral\r\nedge and its position is about midway of the longitudinal diameter of\r\nthe parietals. The narrow postparietal is represented by its anterior\r\nborder; as restored (fig. 24, B) it may be too long. The tabulare, also,\r\nis represented by an anterior portion and it shows this element to have\r\nthe position and form which is typical of the form _Diceratosaurus lævis_.\r\nSuch other of the cranial elements as are indicated are based on the\r\nrelations discovered in _D. lævis_.\r\n\r\nThe heavy line on the left of the drawing (fig. 24, B) represents the\r\noutline of the preserved portion. The skull, as restored, may be a little\r\ntoo long, and the shape of the horns is conjectural. In the orbit there\r\nare preserved 2 misplaced teeth showing longitudinal fluting. The longest\r\ntooth is about 3 mm.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type Skull of Diceratosaurus robustus Moodie.\r\n\r\n                                       mm.\r\n  Median length of skull, estimated    67\r\n  Posterior width of skull, estimated  78\r\n  Length of orbit                      18\r\n  Width of orbit                       12\r\n  Length of longest tooth               3\r\n  Width of same tooth at base           1.5\r\n  Length of postorbital                27\r\n  Width of postorbital                 14\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus EOSERPETON Moodie, 1909.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour.

Hist., XXVI, p. 355, pl. lxiii, fig. 1,\r\n    1909.\r\n\r\nType: _Eoserpeton tenuicorne_ Cope.\r\n\r\nThe genus was proposed for the reception of a single species originally\r\nreferred by Cope to _Ceraterpeton_ (_C. tenuicorne_). The species can\r\nnot be placed in the genus Ceraterpeton on account of the form and\r\nstructure of the skull, which varies widely from that of the type species,\r\nCeraterpeton galvani Huxley, from the Kilkenny Coal Measures of Ireland.\r\nThe most important character in which the present species differs from _C.\r\ngalvani_ is the peculiar form taken by the squamosal and by the position\r\nof the \"horn.\" These characters will be evident on referring to figure\r\n25. No undoubted remains of _Ceraterpeton_ have been found outside the\r\nBritish Isles. Fritsch referred (251) a species, previously described as\r\n_Scincosaurus crassus_, to this genus, but Andrews (8), Jaekel (347) and\r\nWoodward (630) all unite in placing the species in the genus where it was\r\nformerly described. Jaekel even says that the Scincosaurus has no horns,\r\nso far as he can determine. Cope referred 3 species (123) from the Linton\r\nCoal Measures of Ohio to the genus _Ceraterpeton_, but it has been shown\r\nelsewhere (347) that no one of them belongs in the genus, nor in fact do\r\nthey all belong in one genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eoserpeton tenuicorne Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol.

XLII, fig. 2) figured this skull. The\r\nfigure is poorly executed and does not do justice to the specimen, which\r\nis really well preserved. In general the skull is oval, with the orbits\r\nlocated well towards the acuminate snout. The interorbital space is equal\r\nto twice the width of the orbit. The pineal foramen lies near the center\r\nof the skull. The quadrate angles are drawn out into slender acuminate,\r\nlongitudinally striate horns, processes from the squamosal. The \"horn\"\r\narises from an expanded base, which is a portion of the cranial element\r\nat the postero-lateral angle of the skull. This character is taken as\r\nthe distinctive one of the genus.

No teeth have been\r\ndetected. The nasal is likewise not clearly defined, but the frontal\r\nis an elongate element which occupies the space between the orbits and\r\njoins the parietal posteriorly. The parietals form a large oval space, so\r\ncharacteristic of many of the Carboniferous Microsauria, in the anterior\r\nthird of which occurs the median parietal foramen. The postparietal is\r\nalmost square, and forms part of the posterior boundary of the skull.\r\nThe tabulare has the usual position and relations. The prefrontal is\r\nill defined. The postfrontal is small and forms a slender rod on the\r\npostero-inner boundary of the orbit. The postorbital is small and its\r\nbounding suture with the postfrontal is indefinite. The jugal is only\r\npartially represented in the specimen, and that part forms the outer\r\nboundary of the orbit. The maxillary sutures are not defined. There are\r\nno evidences of teeth, since the skull is compressed dorso-ventrally. The\r\nquadratojugal is, apparently, a larger element than usual, with the visual\r\nrelations. The supratemporal lies in great part in front of the squamosal,\r\nbut still has the normal relations of that element. The squamosal is the\r\ncharacteristic feature of the skull. It is very tumid at its base and\r\nprojects into a long, slender, acuminate horn, the tumid portion being\r\nornamented by radiating striæ.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of this species presents the greater part of the\r\nskeleton. However, very little can be added to our knowledge of the skull\r\nstructure. It is barely possible that the second specimen may be distinct\r\nfrom the type. The horns are curved inward, but otherwise there is little\r\nor no difference. One of the most interesting and important features\r\nof the complete specimen is the unusual preservation of a leg, with\r\nimpressions of 15 or more vertebra;, and traces of curved ribs which are\r\nintercentral in position.\r\n\r\nThe femur is slender and expanded at the ends, with the articular surfaces\r\nwell formed. The tibia and fibula are mere rods of bone, although the\r\ntibia has slightly expanded extremities. There is no osseous tarsus.\r\nThere are 5 digits in the foot; the second one is entire and contains 4\r\nphalanges; the other digits are incomplete. The foot is remarkably long\r\nand slender, and is fully as long as the tarsal space plus the tibia, with\r\nthe terminal phalanx clawed.\r\n\r\nThere are impressions of 2 oval and elongate clavicles in the pectoral\r\nregion. The outer end is not expanded as is usual, and the surface is\r\nornamented with grooves and ridges which radiate from a common center.\r\n\r\nThe entire remains measure scarcely 3 inches in length and it is to be\r\ndoubted if the creature attained a length of more than 4 inches. It is\r\nprobably a young form, but there are no evidences of external gills. The\r\nchevron armature is but poorly preserved, but so far as can be determined\r\nit is not different from that of other Microsauria, such as _Amphibamus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                           PLATE 17\r\n\r\nType of _Saurerpeton latithorax_ Cope. × 1.5.

The family characters are the\r\n  huge size of the head as compared to the body, the short, stumpy body\r\n  with about 25 short dorsal vertebræ, a very short tail, phalanges\r\n  clawed, pubis of calcified cartilage, sclerotic plates in the orbit to\r\n  the number of 29 or 30 in each, ventral armature well developed. Teeth\r\n  anisodont, sharp, conical, non-striate.\r\n\r\nTwo genera are associated in this family: _Amphibamus grandiceps_ Cope,\r\nknown from three nearly complete skeletons; _A. thoracatus_ Moodie, known\r\nfrom a single incomplete skeleton; _Cephalerpeton ventriarmatum_ Moodie,\r\nanterior portion of body and skull. The species are all from the Mazon\r\nCreek shales and the family seems unrepresented elsewhere. It may be\r\nnecessary to compare the Amphibamidæ with the Hylonomidæ when the latter\r\ngroup is better known, but in the light of our present knowledge the two\r\nfamilies are distinct.\r\n\r\nThe genera may be distinguished as follows:\r\n\r\n  I. Size small, less than 3 inches in total length, skull with deeply\r\n       incised tympanic notches (ear-slits) _Amphibamus_\r\n\r\n  II.

Geol., XVII, p. 81, fig. 24, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: _Amphibamus grandiceps_ Cope.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the type species of this genus began the researches\r\nof Professor Cope on the extinct Amphibia of North America, which he\r\ncontinued for so many years with such excellent results (105-177). The\r\ndescription was based on a single specimen (plate 3, fig. 7) belonging\r\nto Mr. Joseph Evans, of Morris, Illinois, who loaned it to Dr. Worthen\r\nfor the Illinois Geological State Survey (107), in order that it might\r\nbe described. The type has been destroyed by fire; so I am informed by\r\nMr. L. E. Daniels, of Rolling Prairie, Indiana. There are two other known\r\nspecimens of the species. One is in the collection of Mr. Daniels and the\r\nother No. 794, of Yale University Museum.\r\n\r\nThis genus may be clearly separated from all the other microsaurians by\r\ncharacters which are peculiar to the form. Among these may be mentioned\r\nthe possession of sclerotic plates in the eyes; the large size of the\r\norbits in comparison with the dimensions of the skull; the short, broad\r\nform of the body; the very short tail; the possession of a calcified\r\ncartilaginous pubis; clawed phalanges; presacrals 22. The character which\r\nplaces the genus distinctly in the Microsauria is the possession of long,\r\nslender, curved ribs, first detected on Mr. Daniels's specimen (plate 14,\r\nfigs. 1, 2), by Dr. Hay (316). Its stegocephalian characters are evident\r\nin every particular of its anatomy the roofed skull, the arrangement of\r\nthe cranial elements, the presence of a well-developed ventral armature,\r\nand the digital formula (4 for the hand and 5 for the foot).\r\n\r\nThe genus _Amphibamus_ was regarded by Cope as a representative of a new\r\norder of vertebrates which he called (105) Xenorachia. He later (123)\r\nabandoned this, however. Fritsch (251), Zittel (642), and others regarded\r\n_Amphibamus_ as a branchiosaurian. The exact position of the form was\r\nuncertain until 1900, when Dr. Hay (316) described the long, curved ribs\r\nand suggested its place among the Microsauria. He, however (Cat. Foss.\r\nVert., p. 410), made the mistake of including the branchiosaurian family\r\nProtritonidæ, under Microsauria, thus confusing the subject further. The\r\ngenus (462) has not the slightest relationship with the Branchiosauria.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Amphibamus grandiceps Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc. Phila. Acad. Nat. Sci., pp. 134-137, 1865; Geol.

There is an excellent specimen (plate\r\n4, figs. 5. 6), No. 794 (1234), in Yale University Museum, and another\r\nnearly as good in the possession of Mr. L. E. Daniels, of Rolling Prairie,\r\nIndiana.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Mazon Creek shales, near Morris, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe form of the skull of _Amphibamus grandiceps_ Cope is not unlike that\r\nof _Tuditanus minimus_ Moodie (462) from the Linton, Ohio, beds, but\r\nit is less acuminate than in that form. The large size of the orbits\r\nis especially striking. The shape of the skull is triangular, with\r\nconcavities in the posterior table which correspond to the ear-slits so\r\ncharacteristic of _Metoposaurus_ (242) from the Keuper of Germany. The\r\nnarrowed posterior table of the skull is truncate, as in several other\r\ngenera of Microsauria, notably _Tuditanus_ and _Saurerpeton_. In structure\r\nthe skull differs but little from many of the other Carboniferous forms,\r\nbut the arrangement of the elements of the skull is more regular than in\r\nother genera.\r\n\r\nThe premaxillaries are very small elements in the anterior tip of the\r\nskull. They border the nares. The skull is rather peculiar among the\r\nMicrosauria in the possession of a distinct lacrimal. I have detected\r\nthis element in the cranium of _Stegops divaricata_ Cope. As here defined\r\nthe lacrimal is triangular, with its posterior border formed exclusively\r\nby the prefrontal. Its other relations are the normal ones. The nasal\r\nis elongate, with the usual relations of that element. The frontal\r\nis slightly longer and broader than the nasal. It apparently forms a\r\nportion of the inner border of the orbit. The parietal foramen lies in\r\nthe anterior fourth of the parietal, a rather unusual position for this\r\nstructure. The parietals, as in so many of the Microsauria, together\r\nform the largest element of the skull and are roughly a triangular area\r\nin the postero-median portion of the skull. The postparietal and the\r\ntabulare are clearly distinguishable and they have the usual relations\r\nfor those elements. The maxillary, jugal, and quadratojugal together form\r\nthe greater part of the maxillary border. The postero-lateral angle of\r\nthe skull is, as visual, formed by the squamosal. The orbit is bounded\r\nposteriorly by the postorbital and the postfrontal, which include in the\r\nangle between them the quadrangular squamosal. The orbit is especially\r\nremarkable for its size as compared with the dimensions of the skull,\r\nbeing without a parallel among other known Microsauria. Around the border\r\nof the orbit in the specimen Cope studied (105) there were found 14\r\nquadrangular plates which he called \"superciliary plates.\" Hay (316) was\r\ninclined to regard them as sclerotic plates. In the Yale Museum specimen\r\n(plate 4, figs. 5, 6) there are 20 of these plates, and there seems to be\r\nno doubt that they are sclerotic elements. In the restoration (fig. 26) 29\r\nsclerotic plates are given, but there is no assurance that this number is\r\nthe exact one. They may also have been slightly larger, but not as large\r\nas in Branchiosaurus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.

Cope, in his study of the\r\ntype (105, 107), thought there could be no more than 13 presacrals, but\r\nthe specimen was poorly preserved and indecisive on this point. Dr. Hay\r\n(316) was inclined to the opinion that there were less than 20. The Yale\r\nspecimen shows 22 centra, which are elongate, hour-glass-shaped bodies,\r\nwith the neural spine a long, low crest running the entire length of the\r\ncentrum, with a median elevation, so that in lateral view the spine would\r\nbe triangular in form. The body of the centrum is expanded laterally into\r\na diapophysis which extends anteriorly. The posterior vertebræ, at least,\r\nhad the notochord largely persistent. The osseous part of the vertebra\r\nseems to have been but a thin shell, and the structure of the zygapophyses\r\ncan not be determined. That they were dorsal in position is, however,\r\nevident from several vertebræ. The points of these structures project\r\nlaterally. The tail is short and the caudal vertebræ weakly developed.\r\n\r\nThere are distinct impressions of at least 12 pairs of ribs in the Daniels\r\nspecimen. They are long, slender, and curved, and there is no definite\r\nassurance that there were as many ribs as are indicated (fig. 26) in the\r\nrestoration (462). The ribs are intercentral (469) and probably occupied\r\nthe full length of the vertebral column. There may have been as many as\r\nindicated in the restoration.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of the Yale specimen is the\r\npreservation of a small patch of skin, evidently from the back, lying to\r\none side near the head, measuring 5 mm. in length by 3 mm. in width. The\r\nfragment shows the skin to be of tuberculated scales, 4 of which occupy\r\nthe length of 1 mm. The scales are somewhat hexagonal, almost rounded, and\r\nwere relatively quite thick. They lie in a close mosaic (fig. 27).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.

Specimen No. 794, Yale University\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nThe Yale specimen has, very well preserved, a portion of the ventral\r\nscutellæ, of the throat, chest, and belly. The arrangement of the plates\r\non the throat and chest is almost exactly the reverse of what Credner has\r\ndescribed (190) for _Branchiosaurus amblystomus_ Cred. On the throat, in\r\nthe present form, the chevron points anteriorly, and it is the anterior\r\nprolongation of the belly scutes with the postero-lateral projection of\r\nthe gular scutes which form the chest and arm scutellation. The belly\r\nchevrons point anteriorly, as in _Branchiosaurus_, the rods formed by the\r\nscutes being straight and not curved as in _Branchiosaurus_. The entire\r\nventral armature preserved is displaced to the left of the animal and only\r\nthe anterior portion is preserved.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral girdle is only partially known. The scapula is\r\ncrescent-shaped. The other elements are indicated only by fragments and\r\nnothing is known of their form.\r\n\r\nThe arm elements are nearly all known. The humerus is slender and expanded\r\nat the ends, with its articular surfaces well developed. The separate\r\nradius and ulna are of approximately the same size and length. The\r\ncarpus is unossified. The complete phalangeal formula for the hand of\r\n_Amphibamus_ is unknown. The third digit seems to have 4 elements. The\r\nformula 2-2-3-2 has been suggested (462).\r\n\r\nThe pelvis is very satisfactorily known. The ilium is a long, slender,\r\nstraight rod, with expanded ends. The ischium is shown on both sides of\r\nthe vertebral column in the Yale specimen. Its form is almost identical\r\nwith that of _Paleohatteria longicaudata_ Credner, from the Rothliegenden\r\nof Saxony. The ischia are apparently approximate in the median line,\r\nthough this character is somewhat obscured by the impression of the\r\ncaudal vertebræ. Their relation with the ilium, other than that they\r\nwere posterior to it, is uncertain. The pubis is, apparently, calcified\r\ncartilage. It is a squarish plate, somewhat corrugated, lying anterior\r\nto the ilium in the Daniels specimen. The elements of the pelvis were\r\nundoubtedly hung loosely in the flesh, as in modern salamanders, since\r\nthere is no indication of articular surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe hind limb is well known, the type having a nearly complete leg with\r\nthe foot. The Daniels and the Yale specimens supplement and substantiate\r\nthe type. The femur is longer than the humerus, but more slender, with its\r\narticular surfaces about as well developed as in the humerus. The element\r\nis a simple rod of bone without muscular crests of any kind. The tibia\r\nand fibula are, likewise, slender separate rods of bone. The tarsus is\r\nunossified. The phalangeal formula is 2-2-3-4-3, and is fairly definite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Restoration of probable appearance of _Amphibamus\r\ngrandiceps_ Cope on the basis of the material described herewith. × 1.5.]\r\n\r\nIn the type specimen the matrix in the orbit was blackened as if by the\r\n_pigmentum nigrum_ of the choroid. The same has been noticed in other\r\nspecimens. Professor Cope thought this indicated that the animal was\r\nnocturnal.\r\n\r\nThere are many characters in _Amphibamus_ which seem to approximate the\r\nreptilian type of structure. Among these may be mentioned the character of\r\nthe articular surfaces of the limb bones, the intercentral position of the\r\nribs, the incipient double-headedness and the curvature of the ribs, the\r\npresence of a cartilaginous calcified pubis, the length of the limbs, and\r\nthe clawed character of the phalanges.\r\n\r\n_Amphibamus_ was a low, flat, short, and undoubtedly a creeping, crawling\r\nanimal, possibly spending a portion of its time in the water; but it\r\ncould not have been a swimmer. It was one of nature's first attempts at\r\nconstructing a land vertebrate.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of Amphibamus grandiceps Cope.\r\n\r\nCollection of Mr. L. E.

National Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Mazon Creek shales, near Morris, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe type is a part of the collection of Mr. R. D. Lacoe, in the U. S.\r\nNational Museum. The fossil is very poorly preserved, but the remains are\r\nto be seen on both halves of the nodule, so that considerable can be made\r\nout as to its structure.\r\n\r\nThe chief diagnostic characters which will at once distinguish the species\r\nare the elongate arm, large interclavicle, shape of the vertebra, and\r\ntriangular skull.\r\n\r\nThe portions of the animal which are preserved are the impression of\r\nthe skull with one orbit, the right humerus and radius with portions of\r\nothers, and traces of ventral scutellæ. These remains are so intermingled\r\nwith the remains of plants that it has been quite difficult to distinguish\r\nbone impression from plants. This, however, has been done by whitening the\r\nfossils with ammonium chloride, when the texture of the fossils serves\r\nto distinguish the one from the other. Parts of the plants have been\r\nconverted into galena and kaolin, as have also parts of the bones, so the\r\ntask has been rendered doubly difficult. There can be no doubt, however,\r\nthat the observations recorded below are correct. The position of the\r\narm in relation to the pectoral girdle and the position of the girdle in\r\nrelation to the skull impression first called attention to the possible\r\npresence of a fossil amphibian.\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said of the skull. It is merely an impression in the\r\nnodule. It is triangular in form, with the snout an acute angle. The angle\r\nis, however, exaggerated by the compression to which the fossil has been\r\nsubjected. The right side of the skull lies over a portion of some plant.\r\nThe animal is preserved on its back, so that this gives a good opportunity\r\nfor the study of the pectoral girdle, which is partially preserved.\r\nThe interclavicle is very large and from it the species has been given\r\nits specific name (_thoracatus_--armed with a breast plate). It is an\r\nexaggerated =T=, with the stem very short with its anterior margin\r\ncurved, and ending in a rather sharp, elongate point. The interclavicle\r\nrecalls, in a measure, the same element of the Branchiosauria, although\r\nit is much more expanded anteriorly and has a shorter spine. In these\r\nrespects it resembles more nearly a reptilian interclavicle (fig. 14 B).\r\n\r\nThe clavicle is of the simple triangular shape so characteristic of the\r\nMicrosauria. It is somewhat displaced backward and its inner margin is\r\nslightly obscured. The humerus is elongate, apparently cylindrical, and\r\nwith expanded ends, resembling very closely the humerus of _Amphibamus\r\ngrandiceps_, although its proportions are much greater than in that\r\nspecies. Its length is almost equal to the length of the skull, while in\r\n_A. grandiceps_ the length of the humerus is only half that of the skull.\r\nThe radius (ulna?) resembles in its general proportions those of the\r\nhumerus. It is a more elongate, slender, lighter bone. The impression of\r\nthe other bone of the forearm is obscured.\r\n\r\nA portion of a single vertebral centrum from the posterior part of the\r\ndorsal series is preserved. It is apparently amphicœlous; its width is\r\nnearly half greater than its length.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Amphibamus thoracatus Moodie.\r\n\r\n(No. 4306, U. S.

Univ. Sci. Bull., VI, No. 2, p. 340, 1912.\r\n\r\nType: _Cephalerpeton ventriarmatum_ Moodie.\r\n\r\nThis genus is founded on remains of a nearly entire individual of a\r\nrelatively large microsaurian from the Mazon Creek shales. The genus is\r\nmost immediately related to the Amphibamidæ, of which two species are\r\nalready known, _Amphibamus grandiceps_ Cope and _A. thoracatus_ Moodie.\r\nThe present genus differs from these species in many respects, notably\r\nin size. The skull in _Cephalerpeton_ is nearly as long as half the\r\nentire body of _Amphibamus grandiceps_ Cope, inclusive of the tail. Other\r\nstructural differences are the anisodont teeth, the large size and the\r\nmore median position of the orbits, and the absence of the posterior\r\ntympanic notch in _Cephalerpeton_. The form of the skull recalls that\r\nof _Melanerpeton_ and _Pelosaurus_ (190) of Europe, but those genera\r\nare branchiosaurian, while the present form, from the structure of the\r\nvertebræ and the long, curved ribs, is an undoubted microsaurian. Nothing\r\nlike it occurs in any of the amphibian faunas thus far made known. It is\r\nmost nearly approached by a member of the genus _Erpetosaurus_, but from\r\nthis genus the present form is readily distinguished by the smooth skull\r\nbones, the absence of a posterior table to the skull, and the presence of\r\na highly developed ventral armature. The interorbital width is less than\r\nthe transverse diameter of the orbit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                           PLATE 18\r\n\r\n  1.

A pineal foramen is\r\nnot preserved. The sutures bounding the premaxillaries, the maxillæ, the\r\nnasals, the prefrontals, the frontals, a portion of the parietals, the\r\nsquamosal, the supratemporal, the quadratojugal, and the quadrate (?) are\r\nfairly well preserved. The arrangement of these elements can be discerned\r\nby reference to figure 29. The prefrontals are unusually large and are\r\ntriangular in shape. The supratemporal is also quite large. The surface of\r\nthe skull bones is smooth and there is nowhere an indication of sculpture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.

These\r\nmeasure 0.5 by 0.75 mm. The orbits are large and the interorbital space is\r\nless than the transverse diameter of the orbit. Thirteen teeth, apparently\r\npleurodont, are preserved on the left maxilla. They are short, sharply\r\npointed, smooth, and unequal. The first 2 left maxillary teeth from the\r\nanterior end are short; then follows a tooth which is one-third longer\r\nthan these two; the fourth tooth is somewhat shorter than the third; the\r\nfifth and sixth are still shorter and are practically equal in size,\r\nthough somewhat larger than the first two.\r\n\r\nThe right mandible is preserved almost entire, though so badly eroded that\r\nlittle can be said of its structure. Impressions of 12 teeth are present\r\non the mandible and all are, apparently, equal. The cotylus seems to have\r\nbeen far posterior and an angle of the mandible projected slightly back of\r\nthe skull.\r\n\r\nThere remain only a few indefinite impressions of the cervical vertebræ.\r\nThe union of the skull with the vertebral column is obscured and lost.\r\nImpressions of the dorsal vertebræ are well preserved, and wax molds\r\nmade from these show the structure of the dorsal vertebræ surprisingly\r\nwell. They are long and cylindrical, with the median portions slightly\r\nconstricted by a deep pit on each side of the low neural ridge, which\r\ntakes the form observed in _Thyrsidium_, _Molgophis_, _Phlegethontia_,\r\n_Dolichosoma_ (fig. 8) and other genera. The vertebræ are strongly\r\namphicœlous and the notochord was probably persistent. The sides of the\r\nvertebræ are smooth.\r\n\r\nThe ribs are all intercentral in position; the anterior ones very broad\r\nnear the base, recalling the broadly expanded ribs described by Schwarz\r\n(540) for _Scincosaurus_, _Ptyonius_, _Thyrsidium_, and other genera.\r\nPosteriorly the ribs become slender and cylindrical. They are all rather\r\nlong and distinctly curved, with probably a cartilaginous tip.\r\n\r\nThere is preserved a single element of the right side of the pectoral\r\ngirdle. This is, I think, the coracoid, an element which has hitherto\r\nescaped observation among the American Microsauria. It is long and\r\nspatulate at both ends, with the median portion apparently almost\r\ncylindrical, not unlike that described by Credner (181) for the coracoid\r\nof _Branchiosaurus_, save that the lower end of the branchiosaurian\r\ncoracoid is acuminate. In the present form it is spatulate. Its\r\nrelations with the other elements of the pectoral girdle have never been\r\nsatisfactorily determined.\r\n\r\nThe fore limbs are both partially preserved. The humerus of the right\r\nside is complete. It is greatly elongated for a microsaurian. The form\r\nof the element is not unlike that of a lizard, with the lower end of the\r\nbone spatulate and endochondrium well developed. Very little difference\r\ncan be seen between the form of the arm bones, which represent the radius\r\nand ulna. They are both elongated, with constricted median portion and\r\nexpanded truncate ends. The carpus is unossified and the cartilage has\r\nleft no trace of the elements.\r\n\r\nThe right hand has two metacarpals preserved, which are fully half as long\r\nas the radius and ulna. They are separated some little distance from the\r\nends of these elements, though this may be due to post-mortem shifting.\r\nThe carpus may, however, have been broad. On the left side are preserved\r\nportions of the humerus, radius, ulna, and 3 metacarpals, lying close to\r\nthe vertebral column. The carpal space is not so large on the left as on\r\nthe right. The ventral armature is well preserved in a narrow patch about\r\nan inch in length.

Fossil Reptilia and Amphibia, p. 166, 1890.\r\n\r\n  Skull with the palatines situated near the middle line, internally to\r\n  the vomers and pterygoids, and the palatine vacuities small and placed\r\n  far back. Vertebræ (_Ichthyerpeton_) discoidal. Teeth less complex\r\n  than in the Anthracosauridæ. A ventral armor present and the entire\r\n  body covered with small cycloid imbriated scales.\r\n\r\nThe type genus of this family was placed by Fritsch (251) with the\r\nArchegosauridæ, although its resemblance to _Anthracosaurus_ was pointed\r\nout; it was subsequently made the type of a family by Lydekker (393) in\r\n1890, and placed next the Archegosauridæ. Known from the Coal Measures of\r\nBohemia, Ireland, and Ohio.\r\n\r\nTwo genera from North America, _Ichthyerpeton_ and _Cercariomorphis_, are\r\nassigned tentatively to this family, both known from the Coal Measures\r\n(462) of Linton, Ohio, and both with the body completely scaled. The\r\ndistinguishing characters are found chiefly in the shape and arrangement\r\nof the scales, the structure, form, and size of the body, all of which are\r\ngiven full treatment in the discussion below.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus ICHTHYERPETON Huxley, 1866.=\r\n\r\n  Huxley, Trans. Roy. Irish Acad., XXIV, p. 195, pl. xxiii, fig. 1;\r\n    Scientific Memoirs, III, p. 195, pl. 23, fig. 1, 1866.\r\n\r\nThe genus was founded by Huxley (334) for the reception of the species\r\n_Ichthyerpeton bradleyæ_ from the Kilkenny Coal Measures of Ireland. The\r\nremains of the type specimen represent \"the hinder moiety of the trunk,\r\nwith the greater part of the tail, of an animal whose scaly integument and\r\nlaterally compressed, fin-like tail might easily lead one to take it for a\r\nfish, were not its true position among higher vertebrata settled at once\r\nby the digitate hind limb; while its alliance with the labyrinthodonts\r\nis indicated by the delicate spicular ossicles, which form a rudimentary\r\ndermal shield along the belly.\" (Huxley.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ichthyerpeton squamosum Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour. Geol., XVII, No. 1, p. 69, 1909.\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 37, p. 24, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: Specimens Nos. 4476 and 4459, U. S. National Museum.\r\n\r\nLocality and horizon: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe present species is based on well-preserved remains from the Linton,\r\nOhio, beds. There are two specimens of the species preserved on blocks\r\nof coal and together they represent the greater part of the length of\r\nthe animal. The species is located in the genus Ichthyerpeton, which\r\nwas founded by Huxley (334, p. 351) on remains from the Coal Measures\r\nof Ireland, on account of the character of the dermal covering, which\r\nconsists of small scales such as Huxley described in the form from\r\nIreland. The specific characters of this form are the small size of the\r\nrounded scales, the attenuated tail, the apparent absence of limbs, the\r\ncharacter of the ventral scutellation, and the slightly curved condition\r\nof the ribs.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated, from the portions preserved, that the animal attained\r\na length of not less than 3 feet and its body was long and slender. It\r\nmay have had an appearance similar to the modern caudate genus _Siren_,\r\nthough there were doubtless 4 limbs present instead of 2. The slenderness\r\nof the body is at variance with the condition found in the type species\r\n_Ichthyerpeton bradleyæ_ Huxley, in which the trunk was rather stoutly\r\nbuilt. The character of the anterior portion of the body in the present\r\nspecies can not be determined and the skull is wanting. There are no\r\nevidences of anterior limbs, although the ventral scutellation preserved\r\nwould seem to include the pectoral region. No pectoral shields are\r\npreserved, nor are there any traces of pelvic girdle or limbs.\r\n\r\nThe preserved portions on one block include nearly the entire tail and the\r\nposterior region of the body, and on the other block the dorsal region of\r\nthe body and the anterior portion of the tail, so that the two specimens\r\nsupplement each other in an interesting manner. There are impressions of\r\nseveral vertebræ preserved. They are much the same in character as Huxley\r\nhas described for the type species (_I. bradleyæ_). They are short and\r\nthick and were probably amphicœlous. There are likewise preserved the\r\nremains of rather slender recurved ribs mingled in with the remains of the\r\nventral scutellation and distinguished from the elements of the abdominal\r\nshield by their size and curvature. They are, apparently, single-headed,\r\nbut the character of their articulation can not be determined. The ventral\r\nscutellation consists of fine continuous rods arranged in the regular\r\nchevron pattern. They do not seem to be divided into oat-shaped scutes,\r\nas is the case with the form described by Huxley. The ventral rods are\r\nclosely packed for a distance of more than 6 inches, but as they are\r\nscattered their exact arrangement can not be determined. They seem to\r\nhave extended to the cloacal region, but there are no evidences of the\r\nspecialized clasping organs such as Fritsch (251) has described in the\r\nventral scutellæ of _Ophiderpeton_. The scales, which are well preserved\r\non the tail, may have covered the entire body, since there are many\r\nscattered scales in the dorsal region of one of the specimens. They are\r\nslightly oval, tuberculate, and measure scarcely 1 mm. in their longest\r\ndiameter. They show but slight evidences of having been imbricated,\r\nthough it is likewise possible that they were simply inclosed within the\r\nintegument, and somewhat separated from one another. The most posterior\r\npart of the tail preserved seems to indicate that the tip was attenuated.\r\nIt was probably flattened from side to side. We may thus regard\r\n_Ichthyerpeton squamosum_ as an elongate aquatic animal with a long,\r\nflattened tail, and since there were possibly no limbs or very small ones,\r\nit would be an animal highly adapted for life in the water. The present\r\nspecies is of interest because it represents an additional discovery of\r\nthe scaled Amphibia in North America. The species previously known from\r\nthe Linton, Ohio, deposits is _Cercariomorphus parvisquamis_ Cope. Dermal\r\nscales have also been observed in specimens of _Amphibamus grandiceps_\r\nCope and _Micrerpeton caudatum_ Moodie (462, 478) from the Mazon Creek,\r\nIllinois, beds, and Sir William Dawson (208) described scales accompanying\r\nseveral forms from the Joggins deposits of western Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                           PLATE 21\r\n\r\n  1.

Cope's original description is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  \"Represented by a fusiform body which terminates in a long, slender,\r\n  cylindrical tail, and which is covered with small subquadrate scales\r\n  quincuncially arranged. No fins or limbs are preserved, and the form\r\n  of the head can not be made out. Probably a portion of the skull\r\n  is preserved. There are some scattered bodies in the body portion,\r\n  which look like deeply concave vertebræ with the zygapophyses of\r\n  batrachians. There are some linear impressions at one point, which\r\n  resemble the bristle-like rods on many Stegocephali. They are so few\r\n  as to be of little importance. The scales are like those of fishes.\r\n  There are traces of segmentation in the axis of the long tail.\r\n\r\n  \"The position of this curious form is quite uncertain. It is quite\r\n  different from anything observed hitherto in the American Coal\r\n  Measures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cercariomorphus parvisquamis Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc. Amer. Phil.

(Plate 21, figs. 3, 4; 24, figs. 2, 3.)\r\n\r\nThe scales (Plate 24, fig. 2) in their present condition are entirely\r\nsmooth. At a distance of 20 mm. from the base of the tail they are in 20\r\nlongitudinal series. At that point the transverse diameter of the body is\r\n140 mm. The outline contracts rather abruptly to the tail, of which 66\r\nmm. are preserved. The surface of the tail is obscured by a thin layer\r\nof carbonaceous matter not sufficiently thick to obscure scales, which\r\nare evident at distances of 16 mm., 43 mm., and 52 mm. from the tip. The\r\nscales on the tail are smaller than those on the body and are without\r\nmarkings of any kind. The anterior half of the body is depressed and\r\ndistorted, but the remainder is well preserved and shows a fairly good\r\noutline of an apparently limbless body.\r\n\r\nAn additional specimen (No. 8683 G, of the Newberry Collection, American\r\nMuseum of Natural History) reveals no new facts as to structure, but\r\nserves to show that the body of the animal was long and slender (plate\r\n21, fig. 4). The portion studied comes undoubtedly from the middle of the\r\nbody. No limb elements are preserved. The scales are somewhat larger,\r\nespecially toward the sides of the body, than in the type.

Surv. Ohio, II, pt. II, p. 357, 1875.\r\n\r\n  Elongate, slender, weak-limbed, aquatic microsaurians. Neural and\r\n  hæmal spines of vertebræ elongated, expanded and sculptured. Ventral\r\n  armature weakly developed or absent. Skull lanceolate, with long,\r\n  slender teeth.\r\n\r\nThree genera are assigned to this family: _Ptyonius_, _Œstocephalus_, and\r\n_Thyrsidium_. The forms are very closely related, and when additional\r\nmaterial is secured the three genera may be found to be identical. The\r\nspecies included in this family are: _Ptyonius pectinatus_ Cope, _P.\r\nvinchellianus_ Cope, _P. marshii_ Cope, _P. nummifer_ Cope, _P. serrula_\r\nCope, _Œstocephalus remex_ Cope, _O. rectidens_ Cope, _Thyrsidium\r\nfasciculare_ Cope. The species are all exclusively from the Linton, Ohio,\r\nCoal Measures, and most of them are known from abundant material.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus PTYONIUS Cope, 1875.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol. Surv. Ohio, II, pt. II, p. 373, 1875.\r\n\r\nCope designated no species as the type, but we may regard _Ptyonius\r\npectinatus_ as typical.\r\n\r\nForm elongate, with long tail and lanceolate cranium. Limbs weak, a\r\nposterior pair only discovered. Three clavicular elements; abdomen\r\nprotected by packed osseous rods, which are arranged _en chevron_, the\r\nangle directed forward. Neural and hæmal spines of caudal vertebræ\r\nexpanded and fan-like. Ribs well developed. The various species vary in\r\nlength from 3 to 10 inches. They are the most abundant amphibian in the\r\nLinton beds. The present genus resembles _Lepterpeton_ Huxley (334), of\r\nthe Kilkenny, Ireland, Coal Measures. But that genus possesses divided\r\nabdominal rods, or \"oat-shaped scales,\" and the form of the cranium and\r\nproportions of the body are different.\r\n\r\nThe genus is closely related to, possibly identical with, _Œstocephalus_,\r\nbut additional material will be required to settle this point.\r\n\r\nCope (123) gives the following key for the separation of the 5 species:\r\n\r\n x.

There are numerous representatives of the species, as follows: Nos.\r\n140, 1096 G, 8345 G, 8555 G, 1089 G, 2, 132, 133, no number, 1094 G, 8545\r\nG, 8677 G, 1159 G, 105, no number, 1091 G, 7_a_, 1092 G, 1093 G, 1095 G,\r\n153, and others unnumbered in the American Museum of Natural History; in\r\nthe U. S. National Museum are the following: Nos. 4458, 4463, 4464, 4514.\r\n(Plate 20, fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant species of the Linton Coal Measures. There are over\r\nthree dozen specimens preserved in the Newberry collection. The species is\r\na clearly marked one, as a rule, though there is great variation in the\r\nsize of the body and the form of the vertebræ. Though there are several\r\napparently complete skulls preserved in the collection, it is impossible\r\nto make out the morphology of the elements on account of the amount of\r\ncrushing to which the skulls have been subjected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Restoration of _Ptyonius_. × 1.]\r\n\r\nThe head is lancet-shaped, and the muzzle very elongate, slender, and\r\nacute at the extremity. The head is in fact a miniature of an ichthyosaur\r\ncranium. (Plate 20, fig. 2.) The orbits are large and posterior to the\r\nmedian line. The anterior portion of the skull is narrow, posteriorly\r\ntruncate, and the mandibular angle is projecting. The posterior portion\r\nof the mandible is sculptured. Possibly the entire cranium was also, and\r\nthis has been lost; in fact, this sculpturing is indicated in one or two\r\nspecimens. The teeth are conical and sharp, longitudinally striate, and\r\nanisodont. There seems to be evidence of palatine or pterygoid teeth,\r\nthough this needs confirmation. The pectoral plates are well preserved,\r\nwith the interclavicle a narrow oval, with anterior and posterior\r\nprolongations. In one specimen it is sculptured. The clavicles are narrow\r\nand slightly sculptured. The abdominal scutellæ are bristle-like.\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ are short, with expanded neural and hæmal spines. The\r\nexpanded condition of the neural spines begins over the thoracic region,\r\nwhere they are low. They become well developed in the posterior dorsal\r\nregion. The caudal fan-shaped spines are larger. The dilated portions\r\nform equilateral triangles which stand on moderately short pedicels. They\r\nare weakly ridged, and each ridge is prolonged into a narrow acute tooth\r\nbeyond the margin, 11 of which may be counted on one of the best preserved\r\nspines. The longitudinal striæ are terminated near the pedicel by two\r\nothers which cross obliquely from each side, and, meeting, present the\r\nappearance of the margin of a cup sculptured in relief, from which the\r\nstriæ arise. Pedicels smooth. The spines are in contact at their angles,\r\nthus forming a continuous line. In a typical specimen there are 6 in half\r\nan inch, in another 7, and in a third 8. The ribs are well-developed and\r\nslender.\r\n\r\nNo traces of fore limbs have been detected in the numerous specimens, but\r\nelements of hind limbs are preserved.

The\r\nfan-shaped neural spines commence but a short distance behind the line\r\nof the pectoral shields. They are low, with a few coarse ridges, the\r\nmargin being entire. The abdominal rods are delicate and hair-like. The\r\ninterclavicle is oval, with a few radiating crests, which originate at\r\nthe center; in the areas behind there are a few scattered tubercles.

Cope\r\nbased his description of the species on 9 specimens. There are more than\r\ntwo dozen available at the present time, the majority of them being in the\r\npossession of the American Museum of Natural History. There is a single\r\nspecimen in Walker Museum of the University of Chicago and 3 in the United\r\nStates National Museum. The numbers of all of these specimens are given\r\nabove. The material consists, for the most part, of fragmentary portions\r\nof the vertebral column, but there are a few skulls more or less complete,\r\nthough none are sufficiently well preserved for a complete analysis of the\r\ncharacters. The specimens indicate an animal slightly smaller than the\r\nmodern _Amphiuma_ means of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Restoration of _Œstocephalus_. × 1.]\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary here to enter into a detailed account of each\r\nspecimen, since this has been done by Cope, and a careful comparison of\r\nhis descriptions with the originals indicates that his observations are\r\ncorrect. The species, as suggested in the discussion of the genus, is\r\nnot clearly distinct from those of _Ptyonius_, and it has largely the\r\ncharacters of that genus. The cranium is long, slender, and wedge-shaped.\r\nThe teeth are numerous both in the maxillary and in the mandible, one\r\nspecimen indicating about 30 in a single series. They are all uniformly\r\ncylindrical, except at the extremity, where they are flattened and\r\nexpanded so as to produce a longitudinal edge, which is carried backward\r\non a recurvature of the apex. The bases are anchylosed equally and without\r\nenlargement, and no part of the shaft is striate or grooved. The upper\r\nsurface of the cranium is narrow, with the median suture distinct. The\r\nskull surface, with that of the mandible, is smooth.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic of the species are the remarkable length and slenderness\r\nof the fan-shaped neural and hæmal spines, and the absence of an acute\r\nserration on their margins. In this species the spines have a laminiform\r\nexpansion at the base in their plane. One specimen exhibits the pelvic\r\nregion, including a portion of the tail. The ilium has an expanded\r\nanterior extremity and is directed backwards and somewhat inwards on\r\neither side of the vertebral column. The femur is nearly straight, short,\r\ncontracted medially, and expanded distally. The tibia is shorter and is\r\nsubcylindrical. Beneath the ilium the last chevron of the abdominal rods\r\nappears, the outer extremities rising on the base of the tail.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral arch is almost unknown, and Cope based the distinction of\r\n_Ptyonius_, and _Œstocephalus_ on the absence of these plates in the\r\nlatter genus an uncertain characterization. The fore limbs are indicated\r\nby a humerus. There were possibly from 75 to 100 vertebræ in the entire\r\ncolumn. The animal was exclusively adapted to life in the water and was,\r\nwithout doubt, an excellent swimmer. There are preserved in one specimen\r\nportions of what seem to be hyobranchial elements.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of Œstocephalus remex Cope.\r\n\r\n                                        mm.\r\n  Length of entire caudal series       195\r\n  Width at ninth vertebra               21\r\n  Width at thirty-sixth vertebra         2\r\n  Length of four phalanges in place     14\r\n  Expanse of fan of proximal caudal     18.5\r\n  Length of ilium                       11.5\r\n  Length of femur                       11.5\r\n  Length of tibia                        7\r\n  Length of mandibular dental series    24\r\n  Depth of mandible at middle            5\r\n  Nine teeth in                          5\r\n  Length of longer teeth                 2\r\n  Length of first hæmal branchial       6\r\n  Length of sixth vertebra from skull    7\r\n  Width of centrum                       3\r\n\r\n\r\n=Œstocephalus rectidens Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Trans.

Two specimens present inferior views of the\r\nspinal column, showing that the genus possesses, like _Siren_, enlarged\r\ndiapophyses, but they are peculiar in their fan-like form. They resemble\r\nslightly the neural spines of the caudals of _Ptyonius_, but are present\r\non the dorsal vertebræ. Whether the caudals of the present species possess\r\nornamented neural spines the specimens do not indicate. The abdomen is\r\nprotected by the usual hair-like rods arranged _en chevron_, the angle\r\ndirected forwards. No indications of limbs can be discovered on the\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\nWithout the cranial bones the affinities of this genus can not be\r\ndetermined; while it may be allied to _Cocytinus_, the vertebræ of that\r\nform are without peculiar diapophyses.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Thyrsidium fasciculare Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol.

The centra, seen from below, are much\r\ncontracted in their form, presenting an obtuse median rib, which expands\r\nto the articular extremities. In one or two instances the latter are\r\ndivided by fracture, and the moderately concave form of the adjacent\r\nsurfaces is displayed. The diapophyses are of complex form, but the\r\ndetails are concealed by the prevalent thin layer of coal which invests\r\nthem. An inferior prominence runs parallel to the centrum; outside of this\r\nthe process is obscurely trilobate and thickened, not flattened, as in the\r\ncaudal vertebræ of _Ptyonius_. Several ribs (fig. 8) of moderate thickness\r\nappear by the side of the diapophyses. Eleven abdominal ribs in 5 mm.\r\n\r\nThe second specimen was originally referred to _Œstocephalus remex_, as\r\na posterior portion of its vertebral column, immediately preceding the\r\ncaudal series.\r\n\r\nThis reference appears to be incorrect, although the resemblance between\r\nthe corresponding parts in the two genera is no doubt considerable, and\r\nthe alternative of proposing a new genus and species was not at that time\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nThe neural spines are longer than high, and are nearly in contact at their\r\nmargins; each is marked by about 5 obtuse vertical ribs. A fractured\r\nsection of the abdominal spines in place displayed at least six layers of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe material on which the above account is based is imperfect. The\r\nspecimen figured by Cope (Geol. Surv. Ohio, vol. II, pt. II, pl. xxxi,\r\nfig. 2, 1875) is undoubtedly a portion of the vertebral column of\r\n_Œstocephalus remex_.

Newberry.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThis species is established by remains of 2 individuals, one embracing\r\n16 and the other 14 vertebræ, with ribs. The neural arches, viewed from\r\nabove, have a =V=-shaped outline posteriorly, from the fact that\r\nthe broad zygapophyses meet on the median line and spread out distally\r\nover the broad anterior ones adjoining. The latter appear to be somewhat\r\nconcave and to border the former exteriorly as well as inferiorly. The\r\nbase of the neural spine extends to the posterior emargination, but not\r\nquite to the anterior. The breadth of the dorsal vertebræ above is equal\r\nfrom the emargination behind to the anterior margin of the anterior\r\nzygapophyses.\r\n\r\nThe ribs are long for an amphibian, but not long for a reptile. They are\r\nwell curved, chiefly near the proximal extremity. The longest found,\r\nmeasured by a cord, equals two and two-fifths vertebræ. These vertebræ,\r\nmeasured along the median line above, equal 11 lines; one of these is 3.6\r\nlines in width above. This animal has been, like _Amphiuma_, a snake-like\r\namphibian, but was probably still larger. How near the affinities to\r\nthis genus may be can not now be determined, owing to the want of many\r\nimportant parts of the skeleton, but it differs in the important feature\r\nof large, well-developed ribs. The size of the vertebræ would indicate a\r\nbody of the size of the common rattlesnake (_Crotalus horridus_) and too\r\nlarge for _Brachydectes newberryi_, which is only known from jaws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Drawing from Cope's figure of _Molgophis\r\nbrevicostatus_ Cope, × 0.5]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Molgophis brevicostatus Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol.

The vertebræ are subquadrate in section, and the concavity of\r\nthe two articular faces is not deep. They support strong lateral ridges\r\nseparated by deep concavities. The heads of the ribs are somewhat\r\ncontracted, and the shafts present outward a tubercular angle at a\r\ndistance of one-fourth the length from the head. The remaining part\r\nof the shaft is stout, nearly straight, and gradually contracts to an\r\nobtuse extremity. It possesses a narrow medullary cavity.

The following\r\nis taken from his report (123):\r\n\r\n  \"Established on a specimen which exhibits about twenty-five vertebræ\r\n  with ribs, and the posterior portion of the cranium. No traces of\r\n  abdominal scales or rods, thoracic shields, or limbs are visible. By\r\n  such negative characters it is referable to the genus _Molgophis_,\r\n  although the definition of this genus is incomplete. The present\r\n  batrachian may, indeed, be ultimately found to be an _Ophiderpeton_,\r\n  to which it also bears some resemblance.\r\n\r\n  \"The specimen is that of an animal of very much smaller size than the\r\n  _M. macrurus_. The vertebræ are of moderate length, with a low neural\r\n  spine, and centrum angular at the sides and truncate at the articular\r\n  extremities when in place. The ribs are rather short, slightly curved,\r\n  apparently hollow and intercentral in position. Although the vertebral\r\n  centra are ossified, the elements of the cranium have a larval\r\n  appearance. These consist of two parallel bony plates, which resemble\r\n  the fronto-parietal bones of the frog; they are slightly separated\r\n  from each other, but do not inclose a fontanelle. A wedge-shaped bone\r\n  extends from the outside of the front of each of these, acuminate\r\n  behind, and widening anteriorly in the position of a postfrontal bone.\r\n  In front of the posterior border of each parietal, on its outer side,\r\n  a bony enlargement arises which contracts outward and forward into a\r\n  narrow element which curves forward beneath the postfrontal. These\r\n  look like an anteriorly directed quadrate with articular bone, such\r\n  as seen in the larvæ and some adults of existing batrachians. These\r\n  determinations will require confirmation from additional material.\r\n  In the meantime it is evident that the present specimen can not be\r\n  referred to any of the other species herein described. The elements of\r\n  the cranium are entirely smooth with no sign of sculpture, and in this\r\n  respect the present species is unlike any of the other known from the\r\n  Carboniferous.\"\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ are not so clearly marked as one is led to believe from\r\nCope's figure.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Molgophis wheatleyi Cope.\r\n\r\n                                         mm.\r\n  Length of entire specimen              63\r\n  Length of portion of skull preserved    9\r\n  Posterior width of same                 8.5\r\n  Length of a vertebra                    1.5\r\n  Width of a vertebra                     1.5\r\n  Length of a posterior rib               5\r\n  Width of rib                            5\r\n\r\nThe species is dedicated to Charles M. Wheatley, of Phœnixville,\r\nPennsylvania, one of the original investigators of the Linton deposits. It\r\nis a part of the Newberry Collection.\r\n\r\nAdditional material of this species is represented by specimens Nos. 7\r\nand 8699 G of the American Museum of Natural History. They are both very\r\nunsatisfactory. They consist of molds of the vertebral column, with in\r\none case an enlargement at one end which may represent the head, and if\r\nsuch, the specimen probably represents a distinct species. The impression,\r\nNo. 7, contains molds of about 30 vertebræ which are very similar in\r\nform to those exhibited by the type of the species. To the vertebræ\r\nare articulated short, curved ribs of a slender nature. The vertebræ\r\nthemselves are short and somewhat constricted in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe other impression, 8699 G, contains impressions of about 20 vertebræ,\r\napparently immature, though one can not be entirely sure as to the\r\nnature of the structures. They are covered over with a thin layer of\r\ncarbonaceous material which is impossible to remove satisfactorily. The\r\ntwo specimens remind one of what Huxley has written in regard to the forms\r\nof Microsauria (334) from Kilkenny, Ireland.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of Nos. 7 and 8699 G (Molgophis wheatleyi).\r\n\r\n                                 mm.\r\n  Length of No. 7                87\r\n  Length of head mold            18\r\n  Posterior width of head         6\r\n  Length of vertebra              2\r\n  Length of rib                   3\r\n  Length of specimen No. 8699 G  53\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus ERPETOBRACHIUM Moodie, 1912.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Kans.

Univ. Sci. Bull., VI, No. 2, pp. 353-354, pl. 2, fig. 2;\r\n    pl. 8, fig. 3, 1912.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 799 (222), Yale University Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Mazon Creek shales, near Morris, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe scapula of the present form is exceptional in its shape. It resembles\r\nan asymmetrical pyramid, the anterior side of the lower edge of the bone\r\nbeing contracted so that the anterior edge of the element is arcuate. Its\r\ntop is very thin and possibly terminated in a broad cartilage. The lower\r\nend is thick and heavy and the articular surface is, apparently, well\r\nformed, though somewhat obscured.\r\n\r\nThe element identified as a clavicle is lying on its edge and has the\r\nproportions of the clavicle of _Mazonerpeton costatum_. The exterior\r\nedge is somewhat rounded and small. A portion of another element which I\r\nsuppose to represent the coracoid lies alongside the humerus, although its\r\nform is quite obscured. (Plate 3, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe humerus has a remarkably well-formed head. In perfection of formation\r\nit corresponds well with that of the higher reptiles. This surface can\r\neven be divided into an anterior and a posterior articulation. The element\r\nprojects posteriorly for the distance of 1 mm. from the surface of the\r\nshaft. The shaft immediately below the head is somewhat flattened and has\r\nan ovoid section. Further on it becomes flattened, a part of which is\r\nprobably due to pressure during fossilization.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the forearm are both preserved and are approximately equal\r\nin size. They are remarkable in that they exceed the humerus in length,\r\nalthough they are not so heavy as that element. They are greatly elongate\r\nand slender, with the middle of the shaft only moderately contracted. The\r\narticular surfaces are well formed and both bones were hollow, as was\r\nalso, apparently, the humerus. The ulna may be represented by the most\r\nposterior of the two elements, though the relations of the elements may\r\nhave been reversed (fig. 15, D).\r\n\r\nThe base of the left wing of an orthopterous insect possibly allied to\r\n_Paolia gurleyi_ Scudder lies between the radius and ulna. The nodule also\r\ncontains impressions of plants, a portion of a frond of a _Neuropteris_\r\nand the impression of one of the Cordaites. Lying next the radius is a\r\nslender elongate element which may be a rib or a portion of a metacarpal.\r\nIf a rib, it indicates that the animal belongs among the Branchiosauria.\r\nThe fragment is only half as long as the radius and is entirely too\r\nobscure to base any conclusions. The other characters of the specimen\r\npoint quite strongly to its microsaurian affinities.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the articular surfaces of the limb bones alone would\r\nindicate the microsaurian relationship of _Erpetobrachium_. It may be\r\nprovisionally associated in the family Molgophidæ with such forms as\r\n_Molgophis brevicostatus_ Cope, _Molgophis_ (_Pleuroptyx_) _clavatus_\r\nCope, and _Molgophis macrurus_ Cope from the Coal Measures of Linton, Ohio.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type.\r\n\r\n                           mm.\r\n  Length of scapula        14\r\n  Distal width              6\r\n  Proximal diameter         3\r\n  Length of clavicle (?)   24\r\n  Length of humerus        25\r\n  Length of ulna           24\r\n  Proximal width            4\r\n  Diameter of shaft         2\r\n  Distal width              3\r\n  Length of radius         25\r\n  Proximal width            4\r\n  Diameter of shaft         3\r\n  Width of distal end       4\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus PLEUROPTYX Cope, 1875.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol.

The 5, probably 6, specimens which represent them offer various\r\nviews of the vertebral column, and in none is there any trace of ventral\r\nor thoracic armature. Limbs can be ascribed to them with probability only.\r\nThe vertebræ are of moderate length, with well-developed zygapophyses, and\r\na short and not very elevated neural spine in the dorsal region, which\r\nis not sculptured in any way. The generic character is seen in the ribs.\r\nThese are rather short and very stout and support an ala on the posterior\r\nor convex border, which expands downwards, and then suddenly contracts to\r\nthe shaft. The extremity of the latter is broad and truncate, and includes\r\na medullary cavity, which is only partially fitted with cancellated tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pleuroptyx clavatus Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Geol.

There is no assurance that the genus is\r\ndistinct from Molgophis.\r\n\r\nParts of two individuals express the typical characters of this species,\r\nwhile a third only differs in being considerably smaller. A fourth may\r\nvery probably be referred here, and another, bearing several elements of a\r\nleg, should be most likely associated with the last mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe ribs are considerably narrowed near the head, and appear to possess\r\na low tubercular process some distance below it. The shaft is curved\r\nthroughout; the laminar expansion is quite thin; while the distal end is\r\nexpanded and concave, perhaps for the attachment of cartilage, although no\r\ntrace of this remains on the shale. The neural spines have short bases,\r\noblique anterior and nearly straight posterior borders, with obtuse\r\nextremity. I perceive no essential difference in the smaller specimen,\r\nwhich is one-third less than the types.\r\n\r\nThe limb is appropriate in its proportions to the present species, and may\r\nbe described in this place. The first segment is one-third longer than\r\nthe second, and has a transversely expanded head. The shaft is stout, the\r\ndistal extremity not expanded and concave. The second segment is stout,\r\nmore expanded proximally than distally, the proximal end truncate and\r\nslightly concave. A bone, much displaced, lies near it, and is probably\r\nulna or radius; it is as stout as the first, the end not expanded. Of\r\nmetatarsals there are 2, three-fifths the length of the second bone of the\r\nleg, and of phalanges 2, of 2 digits each. The proximal are three-fourths\r\nthe length of the metatarsals, and indicate elongate toes. The obverse of\r\nthe specimen is preserved, and contains no additional toes or phalanges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Forelimb of a member of the Molgophidæ, possibly\r\nPleuroptyx clavatus Cope. × 0.75.]\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Pleuroptyx clavatus Cope.\r\n\r\n                                     mm.\r\n  Length of vertebral centrum        14\r\n  Depth of a vertebral centrum        9\r\n  Depth of entire vertebra           22\r\n  Length of neural spine              8\r\n  Height of a neural spine            6\r\n  Length of a rib on the curve       42\r\n  Width of a rib at ala               9\r\n  Width of a rib at extremity         5\r\n  Length of first segment of leg     38\r\n  Length of second segment of leg    24\r\n  Length of metapodial bone          10\r\n  Length of first phalanx             7\r\n\r\nHitherto only two portions of the dorsal series and a left limb have been\r\nassigned to this species. The present specimen (No. 4479, U. S. Nat.

The neural spines are indistinct and if developed at all\r\nwere very low and short.\r\n\r\nThe centra are short, cylindrical, and thick. They gradually decrease\r\nin size to where they are lost, since the portion preserved does not\r\nrepresent the entire length of the tail. There may have been 15 more\r\nvertebræ distally and 5 more proximally, thus making about 75 caudal\r\nvertebræ, as Woodward (630) has determined obtains in _Ceraterpeton\r\ngalvani_ Huxley.\r\n\r\nThe ribs are continuous throughout the length of the tail preserved and\r\nhave precisely the same structure as is found in the dorsal region with\r\nthe possible exception that the posterior alar expansion is not so well\r\ndeveloped in the caudal ribs. The ribs are decidedly fan-shaped and\r\narticulate by a single head with a short transverse process.

The characters of the ribs\r\nand vertebræ are the same. The fragment is interesting, since it gives\r\nan insight into the form of the body, which was slender, conforming thus\r\nto other long-tailed microsaurs. Length of specimen, 65 mm.; width of\r\nspecimen, 30 mm.\r\n\r\nThere is still a third example of this species among the collections\r\nbelonging to the National Museum (No. 4484). The specimen includes a badly\r\ncrushed posterior portion of a skull and a series of about 16 crushed\r\nvertebræ, with several pairs of ribs and ventral scutes.\r\n\r\nVery little can be said of the skull save that the maxilla of the right\r\nside was long and bore from 15 to 20 teeth, of which 9 are preserved more\r\nor less completely. The mandible is likewise crushed and one can not\r\ndetermine its elements. Portions of 2 or 3 teeth are preserved. The form\r\nof the mandible is long and slender.\r\n\r\nThe ventral scutes are of the pectoral region. They are long, slender, and\r\nthread-like. They are not closely packed, but I count 12 in a distance of\r\na millimeter.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be determined the vertebræ are the same as has been\r\ndescribed for other specimens.

As a\r\ngreat portion of the length is presented, and no ventral rods or scales\r\nare visible, and as this character is confirmed by a second specimen, it\r\nprobably belongs to the genus. The pectoral shields are also wanting in\r\nthe specimen, but as there is a considerable vacuity behind the skull of\r\nthe specimen, it may be that these were lost with other parts.

There is an outline of\r\na triangular object which may represent the skull of this specimen,\r\nalthough it is so far removed from the vertebræ that there is some doubt\r\nas to whether it belongs with the vertebræ or not. Indeed, there is even\r\ndoubt whether it is a skull. The vertebræ have longitudinal diapophysial\r\nkeels, and have a zigzag interlocking of neural arches. The latter are\r\ndistinctly turned outward. The vertebræ are very numerous, and the tail\r\nvery attenuated. The number preserved is about 60. The total length of\r\nthe coils unwound is about 295 mm., or 11 coils in 8 lines; but there are\r\ninterruptions not measured and confusions not unraveled.\r\n\r\nThis is the most elongate and slender of all the species of the\r\nCarboniferous Amphibia. The vertebræ are apparently ribless and there are\r\nno evidences of limbs or pectoral plates.

It is represented by a series of 22\r\nvertebræ, which, like those of _Phlegethontia linearis_, are devoid of\r\nribs, abdominal armature, dilated neural spines, etc. The series when\r\ncomplete must have been very long, as there is little difference in size\r\nbetween the first and the last of the 22. They are marginate fore and\r\naft, and much contracted medially, owing to the transverse expanse of\r\nthe diapophyses. There may be, indeed, a diapophysial element beneath\r\nthese, but, if so, the two are indistinguishable. They are connected by\r\nlongitudinal impressions, indicating the existence of the tendinous bands\r\nin the longitudinal muscles seen in _Amphiuma_, or the osseous spicules\r\nseen in the same situation in birds. The neural spines, as indicated by\r\ntheir narrow bases, occupy the length of the neural arch, and remind one\r\nof _Amphiuma_.

U. S. Geol. Surv., No. 179, p. 419, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe present family is an association of related forms due to similar\r\nstructure of vertebræ, ribs, ventral scutellation, and limbs. There is no\r\ncharacter in the skull which would indicate a separation of the genera\r\nhere included, at least in the light of present knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe family may be characterized as: Subaquatic or terrestrial vertebrates\r\nwith a typically amphibian development of the ventral armature; ribs\r\nintercentral, as in all members of the order; skull elongate and slender\r\nor broad and obtuse; cranial and dermal elements of the pectoral girdle\r\nsculptured; lateral-line canals indicated in one genus, Saurerpeton; limbs\r\nwell developed, with well-developed digits and ungual phalanges claw-like;\r\nbody usually slender, broad in Saurerpeton; the ribs broad and heavy; the\r\nvertebræ relatively stout; ventral armature highly developed, reaching\r\nthe height of specialization among the Microsauria; scutellæ consisting\r\nof rods, plates, or stout bristles. The family is represented by 5\r\ngenera: _Sauropleura_, _Saurerpeton_, _Ctenerpeton_, _Leptophractus_, and\r\n_Eurythorax_, the association of the last two genera being provisional.\r\nThe genera may be distinguished as follows:\r\n\r\n    I. Pectoral elements sculptured, clavicles triangular, interclavicle\r\n         diamond-shaped, ventral scutellæ rods, arranged _en chevron_\r\n         with anterior angle                                  _Sauropleura_\r\n\r\n   II. Pectoral elements slightly sculptured, cranium broad, obtuse and\r\n         sculptured, ventral armature broad imbricated plates extending\r\n         on to the throat                                     _Saurerpeton_\r\n\r\n  III. Limbs, skull, arches and dorsal vertebræ unknown, caudal\r\n         vertebræ with fan-shaped neural and hæmal spines which may\r\n         indicate relationship with _Ptyonius_ and _Œstocephalus_,\r\n         but in those genera the ventral armature is weakly\r\n         developed; ventral scutellæ curved rod-like plates arranged\r\n         _en chevron_ with anterior angle, marked in abdominal\r\n         region by distinct rounded pits                      _Ctenerpeton_\r\n\r\n   IV.

Ventral armature of closely arranged\r\nrhomboidal scuta, arranged in lines, which are closely placed in chevrons,\r\nwith the angle anterior.\r\n\r\nIn none of the species of this genus have the usual 3 thoracic shields\r\n(clavicles and interclavicles) been observed. The abdominal scutæ, on the\r\nother hand, are much like those of _Saurerpeton_, being, however, smaller.\r\n\r\nThe species formerly described by Cope in the genus _Colosteus_ are\r\nincluded in _Sauropleura_, where they find their closest allies.\r\n\r\nThere are 7 species belonging in this genus: _Sauropleura digitata_\r\nCope, _S. newberryi_ Cope, _S. foveata_ Cope (_Colosteus_), _S.\r\nscutellata_ Newberry (_Colosteus_) (type of genus), _S. pauciradiata_\r\nCope (_Colosteus_), _S. longidentata_ Moodie, _S. enchodus_ Cope\r\n(_Anisodexis_).

(Plate 14, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThis species was first described by Newberry as a fish belonging to the\r\ngenus _Pygopterus_. Cope later placed it under the genus _Colosteus_\r\nand clearly showed its amphibian characters. The genus _Colosteus_ was,\r\nhowever, based on a misconception. Cope in 1897 and Hay (317) referred\r\nthe species to _Sauropleura_, where it is retained. The species is\r\nrepresented by a single individual preserved on a block of coal from\r\nLinton, and is also indicated by an interclavicle and its obverse; this\r\nelement is of larger size than that of the type and was referred by Cope\r\nto _Colosteus pauciradiatus_. The characters of the plate are, however, so\r\nidentical with those of the interclavicle in the type specimen that it is\r\nunhesitatingly referred to the present form.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen consists of the supero-lateral view of a crushed cranium\r\nwith the anterior part of the body, exhibiting the interclavicle and the\r\nventral scutellation. No limbs have been observed in this species. The\r\nmandibles are crushed across the cranium in such a way as to obscure its\r\nstructure. The boundary of the left orbit is doubtfully determined as\r\nbeing a little back of the median line of the skull. There are small teeth\r\npresent on the mandibles, but their number can not be determined. The\r\ncranial elements are sculptured with radiating grooves and ridges, but\r\nthese are weakly developed. The snout is broad and but little narrower\r\nthan the base of the skull. (Plate 21, fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThe interclavicle, somewhat displaced, is the only element of the\r\npectoral girdle preserved. It is peculiar in the possession of a backward\r\nextension which shows a beveled edge. The plate is ornamented by radiating\r\ngrooves and ridges which are strongly developed. The larger specimen of\r\nan interclavicle shows the same characters as the one described, and it\r\ndiffers only in being about twice as large. There are no traces of limbs.\r\n\r\nThe ventral armature of the body is rather weak as compared to that of\r\n_Sauropleura pauciradiatus_, but it is still composed of closely packed\r\nscutes arranged _en chevron_. The character of the ventral armature and\r\nthe sculpturing of the interclavicle are taken as the principal specific\r\ncharacters. From the other species of the genus the present form differs\r\nin its more slender elements of the ventral armor and in the form of the\r\nskull. The ribs are not clearly defined.\r\n\r\nMeasurements.\r\n\r\n                                     mm.\r\n  Median length of skull             70\r\n  Posterior width of skull           40\r\n  Anterior width of skull            20\r\n  Length of jaw                      50\r\n  Anterior width of jaw               7\r\n  Posterior width of jaw             12\r\n  Length of mandibular tooth          1.5\r\n  Length of entire specimen         150\r\n  Width across belly, maximum        47\r\n  Length of interclavicle            27\r\n  Width of interclavicle             13\r\n  Width across posterior extension    4\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sauropleura digitata Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc.

(Plate 20, fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nThis species is represented by a single individual which is quite distinct\r\nfrom other members of the genus. The specimen has been spread over a\r\nsurface of the coal, and exhibits ventral armature, dorsal region with\r\nribs, and anterior and posterior limbs. Skull and caudal region not\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe ventral armature is arranged in parallel lines directed obliquely\r\nforwards and continuous on the median line, forming there a chevron. The\r\nindividual elements are oat-shaped, and acuminate at both ends. They are\r\nmoderately imbricate in an antero-posterior section. On the pectoral\r\nregion between the fore limbs the series of scutellæ assume different\r\ndirections, forming chevrons directed backwards, and forming with those of\r\nthe belly a complete =X=.\r\n\r\nThe humerus, ulna, and radius are rather stout, and of a size relative\r\nto the body, as in common types of existing lizards; the ulna and radius\r\nseparate. The carpus is cartilaginous; the digits are 5 well-developed\r\nfingers having phalanges in the following numbers, commencing on the\r\ninside: 3, 4, 5, 6, 5. The last phalanx of the second is obscured, and it\r\nis not positive that the number is as given; it is more probable that it\r\nwas 4 than 3. The outer toe was more slender than the others; the distal\r\nphalanges of all the toes are stout, as in modern Caudata.\r\n\r\nThe ribs are long and curved as in reptiles, and judging by their\r\ndistances the vertebræ are short; the latter are not well-defined, but\r\nthere is no indication of prominent spines of any kind. The pelvic bones\r\nand portions of the hind limbs are present, but so obscured and confused\r\nas not to be easily made out. Enough remains to show that the hind limbs\r\nwere longer than the fore. Thirteen ribs on one side and twelve on the\r\nother are preserved, with short ribs in the sacral region.

No vertebræ can be definitely discovered and\r\nthe ribs are not distinctly visible. The cranial fragment is the upper\r\nsurface of the tabulare and adjacent elements, and a broad band of the\r\nposterior parts of these is seen to be smooth, and is preceded by a\r\nslightly roughened surface. The abdominal scutæ are diamond-shaped, and\r\nare thin and light, not massive, as in _S. scutellata_, and are sometimes\r\nmarked with a median longitudinal keel. The fore limb is large, especially\r\nthe humerus, which is much dilated distally, and has a strong crest\r\non the outer side from near the proximal end. The ulna and radius are\r\nmuch shorter, and more dilated proximally than distally; they are well\r\nseparated. No phalanges are preserved.\r\n\r\nThe species is represented by other specimens, all of which are\r\nunsatisfactory in determining the structure of the form.

There are other remains associated by\r\nCope with _S. scutellata_ which are here shown to have closer affinities\r\nwith the _S. pauciradiata_.\r\n\r\nThe clavicle is a right-angled triangle, the inner and thin edge concave\r\nposteriorly, the posterior convex. The ridges and grooves are well\r\ndeveloped on the specimen. The visceral side of the element is smooth.\r\n\r\nCope referred to _S. scutellata_ the larger part of an individual with\r\nstrongly developed ventral scutellation. This he figured on plate XXXVI,\r\nfig. 2 (123). Even a cursory glance will, however, suffice to show that\r\nthe sculpturing of the clavicle just described and that exhibited by the\r\nspecimen there figured are identical. Closer examination shows important\r\ndifferences between the species, the principal distinctions being the\r\nstrongly developed ventral scutellæ in _Sauropleura scutellata_, the\r\ndifference in form and sculpture of the interclavicles, and the posterior\r\nextension of the interclavicle in _S. scutellata_ which is wanting in _S.\r\npauciradiata_. The sculpturing of the interclavicle in the form figured\r\nby Cope as _S. scutellata_, just referred to, is identical with the\r\nsculpture of the clavicles, as would be expected. The ridges on all of the\r\npectoral elements of _S. pauciradiata_ are strong and are rather few in\r\nnumber, while in _S. scutellata_ the sculpturing is more in the form of\r\ninterrupted grooves.\r\n\r\nThe specimen (plate 14, fig. 3) exhibits the great part of the body with\r\none fore limb. The skull is wanting. The belly was very broad and strongly\r\nprotected by broad, long scutes arranged _en chevron_. The scutes are\r\nclose together and form a compact ventral armor for the animal. The fore\r\nlimb is very weak. The humerus is represented by its distal end only. The\r\nradius and ulna are very short and weakly developed in comparison to the\r\nsize of the animal. The limbs could not have supported the animal on land\r\nand served, probably, merely as organs of equilibration, for the animal\r\nwas undoubtedly aquatic. The fingers are not all preserved and there is no\r\ncarpus.\r\n\r\nNumerous other remains formerly associated with _S. scutellata_ are here\r\nreferred to _S. pauciradiata_, on account of the strongly developed\r\nventral armor, which is different from that of the type of _S.\r\nscutellata_. The remains do not, however, add to our knowledge of the\r\nanatomy of the forms, as they are very fragmentary.\r\n\r\nTwo skulls are provisionally associated with this species. One of these\r\nskulls is figured by Cope (123) on plate XXXIII, fig. 1. It is there\r\nreferred to _S. scutellata_. That it can not, however, be referred to\r\nthat species is manifest when the teeth are observed. In the type of\r\n_S. scutellata_ the teeth are very small, sharp denticles, while in the\r\nskull under discussion the teeth are well developed and their bases are\r\nlongitudinally grooved. The teeth are elongate in the anterior part of\r\nthe skull and are shorter posteriorly. They are, however, all strong. The\r\nskull is acuminate and the orbit is located about midway of its length.\r\nThe jaw is slightly longer than the cranium.

The skull of _Sauropleura\r\ndigitata_ Cope is not known, but the body of that animal as preserved\r\nrepresents far too small a form for the skull to be referred to that\r\nspecies. The skull is fully half as long as the dorsal region of\r\n_S. digitata_ Cope, so that an association of the remains would be\r\nincongruous. It differs from the skull of _S. scutellata_ Newberry in\r\nsize and proportions. The skull of _S. scutellata_ is narrow, while in\r\n_S. longidentata_ it is quite broad. The teeth of the latter are also\r\ncharacteristic of the species, since in all other known species of this\r\ngenus in which the skull is preserved the large anterior tooth is wanting.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the skull show the coarse sculpturing of the larger species\r\nof Microsauria. It consists more of radiating grooves than of pits. The\r\nskull, as restored (462), is broadly ovate, with the posterior border\r\ntruncate. The muzzle is broad and the nostrils are, apparently, located\r\nnear the anterior margin.\r\n\r\nThe posterior border of the orbits lies near the median transverse line of\r\nthe skull. They are circular and are removed some distance from the margin\r\nof the cranium. Only the frontal and parietal can be determined with\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe mandible is heavy and is provided with pleurodont, heterodont teeth.\r\nNear the anterior end of the mandible there is a very long fang-like\r\ntooth, longitudinally striated and slightly recurved, which arises from\r\na broad base and attains to considerable prominence. The other teeth are\r\nsmaller, though the next succeeding one is still of considerable size.\r\nAll of the teeth preserved are longitudinally striated, but only the two\r\nanterior ones are recurved to any extent.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type.\r\n\r\n                                                   mm.\r\n  Length of the skull in median line                75\r\n  Width of skull at posterior border, estimated     80\r\n  Width of skull across orbits                      60\r\n  Width of orbit                                    10.6\r\n  Length of orbit                                   12\r\n  Interorbital space                                16\r\n  Length of jaw, as preserved                       48\r\n  Width of jaw, maximum                             16\r\n  Width of jaw, minimum                              5\r\n  Length of largest tooth                           11\r\n  Width of longest tooth at base                     4.5\r\n  Length of shortest tooth                           3\r\n  Width of shortest tooth at base                    1\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sauropleura foveata Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Trans.

In size it is intermediate between the largest of\r\nthe interclavicles of _S. scutellata_ and _S. pauciradiata_. The pattern\r\nof the sculpturing is, however, its main distinction. The plate is finely\r\npitted and there are few evidences of grooves. Near the posterior border\r\nof the plate the pits become somewhat defined by ridges which take on a\r\nradiating pattern with the center of the plate as the center.

The reference of the species to the Permian\r\ngenus _Anisodexis_ by Cope is probably incorrect. Our knowledge of the\r\ntwo known species of this genus is not sufficient to separate them, but\r\nfor the sake of convenience the Linton species is placed in the genus\r\n_Sauropleura_. It is located here principally on account of the form and\r\nstructure of the teeth. Cope's original description is given below:\r\n\r\n  \"The generic characters are apparent in the very unequally sized\r\n  teeth with round section. The portion upon which the species is\r\n  based is a part of the right ramus of the mandible, which is in the\r\n  specimen viewed from the inner side. The jaw is obliquely and smoothly\r\n  truncated from below, for the symphysis and surface of the bone is\r\n  smooth. There is a very large tooth near the extremity of the dentary\r\n  bone. Behind it is an interval equal to three times the diameter of\r\n  its base, which is followed by a tooth of about one-third the length\r\n  of the first tooth. Posterior to this one are two teeth of the same\r\n  size as the second, all being separated from each other by about a\r\n  tooth's diameter. These are followed by three subequal teeth of about\r\n  two-thirds the length of the first tooth, and separated by about their\r\n  own diameter from each other. They are all perfectly straight, very\r\n  acute, and without the trace of a cutting-edge. The inflection-grooves\r\n  extend to or a little beyond the middle of the length.\"\r\n\r\nThe present species is smaller than the type of _Anisodexis imbrecarius_\r\nfrom the Texas Permian, to which genus Cope originally referred the\r\npresent species, and the apices of the teeth do not display the opposite\r\ncutting-edges seen in the Texas form.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type Specimen.\r\n\r\n                                        mm.\r\n  Length of jaw, including 7 teeth      31\r\n  Depth of ramus at second tooth        10\r\n  Length of first tooth                 10.5\r\n  Length of third tooth                  3.5\r\n  Length of sixth tooth                  7.5\r\n\r\n\r\nSkin of Sauropleura Sp.\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., XXVI, p. 355, pl. lx, fig. 1, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe present specimen is interesting on account of the presence of what I\r\ntake to be a portion of the skin, which is preserved as a smooth mold over\r\nthe ribs and ventral scutellæ. The skin was undoubtedly that of the back,\r\nsince the creature is preserved on its belly, and is interesting in not\r\nshowing the slightest trace of scales or other hard plates. The ventral\r\nscutellæ are characteristic of the species of the genus _Sauropleura_.\r\nWith one species of this genus, _Sauropleura scutellata_ Newberry, the\r\nwriter has found associated scutes of some size, and the same fact has\r\nbeen noted by Cope.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus SAURERPETON Moodie, 1909.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour. Geol., XVII, No. 1, p. 80, fig. 23, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: _Saurerpeton latithorax_ Cope.\r\n\r\nThis generic name is erected for the reception of a single species\r\ndescribed by Cope in 1897. The name is made necessary by the wide\r\ndivergence of the characters exhibited by the present species from those\r\nof the species of the genus (_Sauropleura_) to which Cope (176) referred\r\nthis species. The form is not a member of the genus _Sauropleura_, for\r\nreasons given below.\r\n\r\nThe species of the genus _Sauropleura_ have a lanceolate head with\r\nhomodont dentition or nearly so. The orbits are located well back in the\r\nskull. The form of the body is elongate and slender and the limbs where\r\nknown are long and attenuated. The ventral scutellation consists of\r\noat-shaped scutes arranged in a chevron series. The form here described\r\nas _Saurerpeton latithorax_ Cope has nearly the opposite of all of these\r\ncharacters, and it is incongruous to locate the form under the former\r\ngenus. The skull of _Saurerpeton latithorax_ Cope is broad and heavy.\r\nThe teeth are heterodont. The body is broad and stout and the limbs are\r\nof unusually strong proportions. The character of the ventral armature\r\nis also of a very different type. In _Saurerpeton_ it consists of very\r\nbroad imbricating scutes which form a single piece across the abdomen and\r\nare angulated to form the chevron pattern which is so common among the\r\nStegocephalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Saurerpeton latithorax Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc. Am. Phil. Soc., XXXVI, p. 86, pl. iii, fig. 4, 1897.\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour. Geol., XVII, No. 1, p. 80, fig. 23, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 4471, U. S. National Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures. Collected by R. D.\r\nLacoe.\r\n\r\nThis species is indicated by remains of the anterior half of a large\r\namphibian (plate 17) preserved on a block of bituminous coal from the\r\nLinton mine. The form is unusual in the proportions of the head and the\r\nwidth of the thoracic region. In these characters it stands alone among\r\nthe Amphibia from this locality, where the forms are for the most part of\r\nrather slender build and tapering, pointed head.\r\n\r\nThe skull is represented in a fairly complete condition and shows the\r\nusual stegocephalian arrangement of the skull elements, as well as the\r\nsculpturing of the bones, which is similar to that found in other members\r\nof the Microsauria. The skull is broadly rounded, with the posterior\r\nborder incised, the broad tympanic notches thus rendering the shape of the\r\nskull somewhat like that of the branchiosaurs. The orbits are broad ovals\r\nand lie well forward in the skull. They are separated by a space which is\r\ngreater than the greatest diameter of the orbit. The pineal foramen lies\r\nwell back and is clearly indicated as a circular opening which lies in the\r\nmedian suture in the posterior half of the parietals. The nostrils seem to\r\nbe elongate and have an oblique position, as is represented in the diagram\r\n(fig. 35), but this character is not ascertained definitely.\r\n\r\nThe borders of the premaxillæ and the anterior suture of the nasal can\r\nnot be determined, though they may have had some such arrangement as\r\nsuggested. The nasal is represented, so far as is determinable, by an\r\noblong element lying between the frontal and the anterior border of the\r\nskull. The f rentals are very large and form a portion of the inner border\r\nof the orbit. The parietal is probably the largest bone in the cranium\r\nand together the two elements form a large quadrangular space in the\r\nposterior half of the skull. They inclose the circular pineal foramen.\r\nThe postparietal is a small element lying on the posterior border of the\r\nskull and with the tabulare and a part of the supratemporal forms the\r\nprojection. The prefrontal is probably a small element, especially if\r\nthe lacrimal is present. There seems to be an indication of a suture\r\nseparating the lacrimal from the prefrontal, but this character is not\r\nassured. The boundaries of the maxillæ are clear anteriorly. They indicate\r\nthat this element was elongate, as is usual, and impressions of teeth\r\nborne on the mandible would indicate the probability that the teeth were\r\nheterodont. In the premaxillary region there is a long, strong tooth\r\npreserved, and on the maxillary near the posterior extremity of this bone\r\nthere are impressions of teeth which are no more than one-fourth as large\r\nas the premaxillary one. The borders of the jugal can not be ascertained,\r\nsince the skull is injured on both sides in this region. Likewise the\r\nquadratojugal is conjectural. The boundaries of the postfrontal and\r\nthe postorbital are clearly ascertained. They together form the entire\r\nposterior border of the orbit and send prolongations along the lateral\r\nborders of these openings. They are both acuminate posteriorly and these\r\npoints are inclosed by the tabulare and supratemporal for the postfrontal\r\nand by the squamosal and prosquamosal space for the postorbital. The\r\nboundaries of the tabulare show this element to be quite large and\r\nextending forward into an acumination which is inclosed by the parietal\r\nand the postfrontal. The sutures bounding the squamosal have been obscured\r\nby injury in removing the specimen and are indeterminable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Outline drawing of the skull and skeleton, as\r\npreserved, of _Saurerpeton latithorax_ (Cope), from the Linton, Ohio, Coal\r\nMeasures.

Its characters can not be ascertained. There are a\r\nfew evidences of ribs. They represent long, slender, non-alate elements,\r\ntheir mode of articulation with the vertebræ being obscured by the\r\nplate-like ventral armature which covered the abdomen of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral girdle is represented by the remains of three elements which\r\nare interpreted as being the interclavicle and the two clavicles. The\r\ninterclavicle is broad and is rounded posteriorly. There is no evidence\r\nof the usual acumination posteriorly. The element is nearly as wide as\r\nlong. There is a prominent longitudinal keel on the ventral surface of\r\nthe interclavicle and radiating lines which may indicate the courses of\r\nblood-vessels or nerves or may be the ornamentations of the element,\r\nprobably the latter. The clavicle has the usual microsaurian form. It has\r\nthree points and is truncate exteriorly. It is ornamented with radiating\r\ngrooves of a shallow and not strongly pronounced character. There is no\r\nevidence of the coarse sculpture of the later forms. If the scapula is\r\nrepresented it is merely by an indeterminate fragment insufficient for\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral limbs are preserved nearly entire. The left fore limb lacks\r\nonly a few phalangeal bones, and these were preserved with the remainder\r\nof the skeleton but were lost in the mining process. The humerus is an\r\nextraordinary element on account of its robust dimensions. It is very\r\nstoutly built and represents a powerful limb. It is expanded at each\r\nextremity and the width of its shaft is about equal to one-fourth of its\r\nlength. The ulna and radius present the same characters as the humerus,\r\n_i.e._, in being robust, with stout shaft and expanded ends. The ulna\r\nis slightly longer than the radius and has an expanded upper end. The\r\nradius is short and does not have the proximal expansion. The carpus was\r\ncartilaginous. Its position is represented by a blank space on the coal.\r\nThere are 4 digits preserved and in all probability this was the entire\r\nnumber. The metacarpals are elongate and expanded at the extremities. The\r\nfirst and second digits are represented nearly complete. The first digit\r\nis extremely interesting in the possession of a claw-like terminal phalanx\r\nwhich much resembles that of some lizards. There are 3 phalanges in the\r\nfirst digit and 4 in the second. The phalangeal formula may have been\r\n3-4-4?.\r\n\r\nThe ventral scutellation of this species is of an unusual character. It\r\nconsists of broad, imbricated scutes which are in a single piece and which\r\nare arranged in the usual chevron pattern. The scutes were, apparently,\r\nbroadest in the middle and tapered somewhat at the extremities. This\r\ncharacter alone is sufficient for separating the genus from that of any\r\nother known form.\r\n\r\nThe genus finds its nearest allies in the forms of the species of the\r\ngenus _Sauropleura_, in which Cope formerly located the present species.\r\nThe skull of the form described as _Tuditanus radiatus_ Cope is quite\r\nsimilar to the present form, both in the sculpturing and arrangement\r\nof the elements. The characters wherein the present form resembles the\r\nspecies of _Sauropleura_ are the possession of broad pectoral plates\r\nand strong, digitate limbs. The general form of the body and skull is\r\ndifferent in the two groups. It is slender in _Sauropleura_ and decidedly\r\nstout, short, and heavy in Saurerpeton.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type.\r\n\r\n                                       mm.\r\n  Length of specimen                   130\r\n  Median length of skull                51\r\n  Width of skull at posterior border    62\r\n  Width of skull across orbits          48\r\n  Length of orbit                       14\r\n  Width of orbit                        10\r\n  Interorbital space                    16\r\n  Length of longest tooth preserve      14\r\n  Length of shortest tooth preserved     1\r\n  Length of the interclavicle           26\r\n  Width of interclavicle, maximum       23\r\n  Length of clavicle                    22\r\n  Width of clavicle                     18\r\n  Length of abdominal scutes            28\r\n  Length of humerus                     19\r\n  Width of humerus at upper end          6.5\r\n  Length of ulna                        11\r\n  Length of radius                       9\r\n  Length of metacarpal                   3\r\n  Length of first digit                 12\r\n  Length of terminal phalanx             3.5\r\n  Length of lower jaw on the curve      70\r\n  Width of lower jaw, maximum            8\r\n  Length of rib                         30\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus CTENERPETON Cope, 1897.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc. Am. Phil. Soc., XXXVI, p. 83, pl. iii, fig. 1, 1897.\r\n\r\nType: _Ctenerpeton alveolatum_ Cope.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Ctenerpeton_ was founded by Cope for the reception of a single\r\nspecies which presents some very unusual characters. The form shows close\r\nrelationships to the genera _Urocordylus_ (334), _Œstocephalus_, and\r\n_Ptyonius_. These genera agree with the present one in the possession\r\nof very characteristic vertebræ which are signalized by the elongate\r\nand ornamented characters of the neural and hæmal spines. These project\r\nprominently from the body of the vertebra and have the ends of the\r\nprojections truncate and divided into fine points, thus causing the spine\r\nto have much the appearance of a comb. The surface of the neural spine is\r\nsometimes marked with a shallow groove. The spines are longer and more\r\nslender in the genera _Œstocephalus_, _Urocordylus_, and _Ctenerpeton_\r\nthan they are in the species of the genus _Ptyonius_, where they are\r\nshort, although the usual pectinations are present.\r\n\r\nThe character on which this genus rests is the shelf-like extension (plate\r\n23, fig. 2) of the abdominal plates. This is of a very unusual character\r\nand entirely unknown in any other species of Carboniferous Amphibia.\r\nThe term Ctenerpeton has reference to the fact that the ends of these\r\nshelf-like plates project in a pectination along the side of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ctenerpeton alveolatum Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc.

National Museum, Lacoe Collection.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe species rests on a single specimen (plate 19) from Linton, Ohio, and\r\nis preserved on a block of bituminous coal. It is in a very good state\r\nof preservation. There are present on the block of coal a part of the\r\nright fore limb, the greater part of the dorsal portion of the animal,\r\nand the anterior part of the tail. There are no evidences of hind limbs,\r\nalthough this may not be taken as evidence that they were not present on\r\nthe animal. No thoracic plates have been observed. The chevron armature\r\nis present beyond the cloacal region, but there are no evidences of the\r\nspecialized clasping organs which are apparently developed from the\r\nabdominal armature in some forms (251).\r\n\r\nEach dermosseous rod of the abdominal scutellation consists of three\r\npieces a median angulated portion and the two lateral parts which form\r\nthe shelf-like projection along the side of the abdomen (plate 23, fig.\r\n2). The marginal chevron differs in form from the other plate, aside\r\nfrom the fact that it is not angulated. The lateral shelf is composed of\r\nflattened plates which articulate with the median piece, and at the place\r\nof articulation there is a ridge present in the specimen. The exterior\r\nplates are curved backwards and are somewhat attenuated distally. They\r\nare broader than the median piece and differ also in the absence of the\r\ncharacteristic alveoli. The median plate is angulated and is of more\r\nslender proportions than the lateral pieces. Its ventral surface is\r\nornamented with a single row of closely placed alveoli which resemble in\r\na great degree the alveoli of the jaw of some small animal. The ventral\r\nscutellation is broad anteriorly, but becomes more slender posteriorly and\r\nshortly posterior to the cloacal region disappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                           PLATE 23\r\n\r\n  1.

The only parts which can with certainty be referred to the\r\ngenus are the upper and lower jaws of 3 specimens. These bear large teeth,\r\nround in section at the base, but with acute compressed apex, with a\r\ncutting-edge on the anterior face; the enamel is delicately grooved, as an\r\nexternal indication of the labyrinthic structure. A characteristic feature\r\nis seen in the presence of a large elongate tooth in the upper jaw, in the\r\nposition of a canine which much exceeds in length any of the others. The\r\nsculpture of the cranium is but little marked in the known specimens. In\r\nthe type the lower jaw is marked with inosculating grooves. Three species\r\nare known, which are among the largest of the Linton Amphibia.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leptophractus obsoletus Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc. Phila. Acad. Nat.

The description has been verified from\r\nan examination of the type material.\r\n\r\n\"The teeth are rather distantly grooved for some distance above the base.\r\nThey are of different sizes; the smaller are compressed, and with fore and\r\naft cutting edges. The external surface of the dentary bone is marked with\r\nshort oblique grooves along its middle region; above these are grooves\r\nwhich inosculate, forming a figure like an open net dragged in the long\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"Excepting the grooves the teeth are smooth. The smaller ones are close\r\ntogether and their crowns are curved backwards; the larger ones are at\r\nmore remote intervals; both have enlarged bases. Whether both forms are in\r\nthe same series I can not determine. There are from four to five of the\r\nsmaller to an inch.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of Type of Leptophractus obsoletus Cope.\r\n\r\n                                     mm.\r\n  Depth of fragment of jaw           75\r\n  Length of smaller teeth            19\r\n  Length of longer tooth             23\r\n  Width of vertex at middle scuta   176\r\n  Width of paired median scuta       56\r\n  Width of single scute              36\r\n  Length of single scute             48\r\n\r\n\"Some vertebræ were found at the same locality, but there is no evidence\r\nas to the species to which they may have pertained. They are short,\r\nconcave on one end, and probably so on the other. The centrum of one is 12\r\nmm. in diameter; neural spines injured.\" (Geol. Surv. Ohio, II, pt. II,\r\npl. 39, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\n\"A third and larger specimen was found by Professor Newberry during the\r\nfield season of 1874. It includes an oblique view of one side, and the\r\ntop of the cranium from the posterior part of the orbits to the end of\r\nthe muzzle, with the corresponding part of the alveolar region of the\r\ndentary bone, with teeth. The bones of the skull appear to have been\r\nrather light, and though the surface is irregular, the sculpture consists\r\nonly of shallow impressions of varying size and intervals. The orbits are\r\nalso badly defined, but appear to have been large, and separated by a\r\nnarrow frontal bone. The premaxillary bone is preserved, and shows clearly\r\nthe sutures that separate it from its fellow and from the maxillary. A\r\nlarge foramen--perhaps the nostril--separates it from the maxillary, so\r\nthat it forms an irregular crescent. It supports two teeth, of which the\r\nanterior is the larger, but there were perhaps others in advance, as the\r\nalveolar border is imperfect towards the end of the muzzle. The anterior\r\ntwo teeth of the maxillary bone are followed by a strong groove which\r\nrises towards the sides of the muzzle. At first sight this gives the\r\nimpression of the maxillo-premaxillary suture, and makes it appear that\r\nboth the premaxillary bones are preserved, and that the foramen above\r\ndescribed separates the premaxillary spines, instead of representing the\r\nnostril. The cutting edges of the teeth of these bones have, however, one\r\ndirection, whence they represent one side of the cranium only; were both\r\nsides represented, the directions of the tooth axes would be reversed.\r\n\r\n\"The premaxillary and maxillary teeth exhibit a cutting edge on the outer\r\nposterior margin of the distal half; the base of the crown is subround\r\nin section. The line-like grooves are distinct but not numerous, their\r\nintervals measuring 75 mm. Beyond them the enamel is smooth. The second\r\nmaxillary tooth is larger than the first, which is equal to the last\r\npremaxillary. The third and fourth maxillaries are equal to the second,\r\nbut the fifth is larger and longer, exceeding all the others. The teeth of\r\nthe dentary bone differ from those of the upper jaw in having the cutting\r\nedge of the crown on the anterior aspect, while the posterior border is\r\nobtuse. There is an obtuse cutting edge on the posterior margin of the\r\nanterior mandibular teeth.\r\n\r\n\"This description is derived from an adult animal, as the maxillary teeth\r\nin some instances are partially worn away by friction on their anterior\r\nand outer faces.\"\r\n\r\nMeasurements.\r\n\r\n                                                    mm.\r\n  Length of maxillary bone preserved                146\r\n  Length of same supporting five teeth               73\r\n  Length of first maxillary tooth                    15\r\n  Diameter of same at base                            6\r\n  Diameter of second at base                          8\r\n  Length of basis of fifteen teeth of the dentary   145\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leptophractus dentatus new species.=\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 10850, American Museum of Natural History.

(Plate 22, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nCope's description of this species, to which I have nothing to add, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  \"This species is based on portions of the skull of two individuals of\r\n  large size. Both upper and lower jaw with teeth are represented and\r\n  the teeth are of very large size. The deepest element preserved has\r\n  been provisionally referred to the mandible and will be so described.\r\n  This element bears two types of teeth in very heterodont fashion. The\r\n  teeth in the back portion of the jaw are rather short and slender.\r\n  The teeth more anteriorly are, some of them, very long, rather stout,\r\n  with their bases longitudinally fluted, as are they all v The longest\r\n  tooth in the jaw measures slightly less than an inch. The bone is not\r\n  well preserved, but seems to have been ornamented with grooves of no\r\n  great depth. The most anterior teeth of the jaw are smaller than the\r\n  posterior ones.\r\n\r\n  \"The upper jaw is set with teeth which are more uniform in size and\r\n  there is but little tendency to heterodonty. These teeth are also\r\n  striated at their base and all end in a sharp point. They are all,\r\n  apparently, straight. There is no tendency to curve as there is in the\r\n  genus _Macrerpeton_. The upper teeth are more closely set than are\r\n  those of the lower jaw, which are rather distantly placed.\r\n\r\n  \"Another specimen of a smaller individual presents the same portions\r\n  of the skeleton and the same characters. It is possible that this\r\n  skull will be found to belong to _Ichthycanthus ohiensis_ Cope, which\r\n  is based on very large vertebræ and limb bones.

The posterior\r\nlimbs are well developed, with distinct tibia and fibula, osseous tarsus,\r\nand 5 digits. Ribs elongate, simple, curved. Abdominal armature consisting\r\nof bristle-like rods in anteriorly directed chevrons. Dorsal vertebræ not\r\nelongate, with simple neural spines. Tail large, its vertebræ ossified,\r\nand furnished with slender chevron bones which terminate in a hæmal spine.\r\nNeural spines broad and directed backwards; the caudal series somewhat\r\nresembling that of a fish. All the centra are amphicœlous.\r\n\r\nThis genus differs from all those with enlarged and sculptured neural\r\nspines, and from those with abdominal scutes. It is equally distinct from\r\nthose without ribs, abdominal rods, or limbs. It is possible that some of\r\nthe species referred to _Tuditanus_, in which these parts are unknown,\r\nmay belong to it, or that it may be established on a small species of\r\n_Leptophractus_, a genus known only as yet from the skull.

S.\r\nNewberry, in the summer of 1876.\r\n\r\nThe centra of the dorsal vertebræ are about as long as deep, and their\r\nsides are deeply concave; there are 4 anterior to the pelvis which are\r\nwithout ribs. The caudal vertebræ are robust, and 7, from the first,\r\nsupport a small tubercle-like diapophysis. The chevron bones are short and\r\nacuminate; the neural spines are a little shorter, narrow, and truncate,\r\nand directed backwards at the same angle as the chevron bones. They are\r\nmuch reduced on the eighteenth caudal vertebra, where the chevron bones\r\nare considerably longer.\r\n\r\nThe abdominal rods are quite slender. The hind limb is quite stout for\r\nthis order. The femur is regularly expanded at both extremities, but the\r\ndistal is deeply and openly grooved, distinguishing the condyles, while\r\nthe proximal end is plane. There is no trochanter visible. The ulna\r\nand radius are well separated, and are three-fifths the length of the\r\nfemur. There is a large fibular tarsal bone of a subquadrate outline. In\r\nimmediate contact with it is probably the external digit with 5 phalanges\r\nor segments; the ungual is simply conic. The femur is as long as 5 dorsal\r\nvertebræ.

(Plate 23, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThis amphibian is represented by the same portions of the skeleton as the\r\npreceding species, furnishing a good basis for comparison. It is very well\r\npreserved, displaying the characters, especially of the hind foot, which\r\nis almost entirely represented.\r\n\r\nSeveral features distinguish it from the _I. ohiensis_, one of which is\r\nof more than usual value if correctly indicated by the fossil. There are\r\n10 vertebræ from the anterior end to the sacrum preserved in place, and\r\nnone of them supports a rib, nor are there any ribs visible anywhere on\r\nthe block of shale. I suspect that they exist on more anterior vertebræ,\r\nor may have been displaced to a more anterior position than they normally\r\noccupy. The abdominal chevrons are more anterior in position than are\r\nthose of the _I. ohiensis_. The hind legs are longer than in that species;\r\nin this one the femur equals 7.5 vertebral centra in length. The external\r\ndigit, on the other hand, while bearing 5 phalanges, is distinctly\r\nshorter. The fibular tarsal is of a transverse oval, not quadrate, form.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal centra are shorter and deeper than long; the neural arches are\r\nelevated, with short but distinct zygapophyses, and a flat, subquadrate,\r\nsuperiorly truncate, neural spine. They bear short, vertically compressed\r\ndiapophyses near the base of the arches. The neural spines of the caudal\r\nvertebræ become rapidly more slender, and also diminish in length, while\r\nthe zygapophyses are continued to the fifteenth vertebra. The chevron\r\nbones are slender, and inclose a moderate hæmal opening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOODIE                                           PLATE 24\r\n\r\n  1.

Proximally there is\r\na trochanteric ala, besides the obtuse head. Distally the condyles are\r\nwell distinguished, the external or fibular being truncate. The fibula is\r\nless than three-fifths the length of the femur, and is expanded at both\r\nextremities. Two proximal tarsals are distinct; the one next the fibula\r\nis larger than the other and transverse suboval in form. It has a median\r\ndividing ridge as though composed of fibulare and intermedium coössified.\r\nThe tibiale is subtriangular. There are five distinct phalangeal tarsals.\r\nThe toes are, in the order of their lengths, beginning with the shortest,\r\n1-2-5-3-4. Their phalanges (including metatarsals) are, in the proper\r\norder, commencing with the hallux, 3-3-4-5?-5, the distal end of the\r\nfourth finger being lost. These bones are rather stout, and the unguals\r\nare simply conic. The form of the foot is short and wide. The number of\r\nthe phalanges is nearly similar to that found in _Amphibamus grandiceps_,\r\nexcepting that in that species the fifth digit has but 4. They are more\r\nnumerous on most of the digits in _Sauropleura digitata_. Cope (Trans.\r\nAm. Phil. Soc., XVI, 289, fig. 1, 1888) contributed the following note on\r\n_Ichthycanthus platypus_:\r\n\r\n  \"A reëxamination of the type specimen of this species from the Coal\r\n  Measures of Ohio, preserved in the Museum of Columbia College, New\r\n  York, enables me to refer this species to the Rachitomi. The neural\r\n  spines are distinct, showing that it belongs, probably, to the\r\n  Eryopidæ. As the skull is not preserved, I can not determine the genus\r\n  positively, but refer it for the present to Eryops. I append a figure\r\n  of the posterior foot, which displays the characters of the tarsus\r\n  of this group for the first time. The number of tarsals is as in a\r\n  Theromorph reptile, except that two elements represent the cuboid\r\n  bone as in the reptile, _Stereosternum tumidum_ Cope; giving five\r\n  elements in the distal tarsal row.

The block of coal containing\r\nthese interesting remains is from Linton, Ohio, and is preserved in the\r\ngeological collections of Columbia University, from which institution\r\nProfessor Grabau very courteously forwarded it for study.\r\n\r\n_Ichthycanthus platypus_ was described by Cope from the Linton, Ohio, Coal\r\nMeasures, locating it doubtfully in the Permian genus _Eryops_ on account\r\nof the unusual condition of the tarsus and reconsidering a former decision\r\nin favor of a Coal Measures genus _Ichthycanthus_. In this disposition\r\nof the species into the Permian genus he is followed by Hay (317); but\r\nBaur (28) regarded the form as a member of the Coal Measures genus\r\n_Ichthycanthus_, after commenting on the later definition by Cope. The\r\ntype of the genus, _Ichthycanthus_, to which Cope first allied the species\r\nunder consideration, is _I. ohiensis_, a supposed amphibian from the Coal\r\nMeasures of Linton, Ohio, founded on incomplete material.\r\n\r\nThe form combines in an unusual and remarkable degree reptilian and\r\namphibian characteristics. The leg bones, pelvis, and tarsus are all\r\nstrikingly reptilian, but the phalanges in the arrangement of elements\r\nare so typically amphibian that if we had no other means of diagnosis we\r\nwould incline to locate this Coal Measures species among the Amphibia.\r\nThe leg (plate 23, fig. 1) recalls in its structure that of another\r\nCoal Measures species, _Eosauravus copei_ Williston, which is, however,\r\nclearly a reptile. While there is a general degree of similarity between\r\nthe foot structure of _Eosauravus copei_ and _Ichthycanthus platypus_,\r\nyet there are very great differences in the phalangeal formula and the\r\narrangement of the tarsal elements. These differences are clear and\r\nindicate a separation of the two species into distinct classes. The\r\nphalangeal formula in the _Eosauravus_, 2-3-4-5-4, is typically reptilian;\r\nwhile in the _Ichthycanthus_, 2-2-3-3-3, it is amphibian. The tarsus of\r\nthe _Ichthycanthus_ is amphibian in the presence of an intermedium, but\r\nthis is very small and the remaining tarsal structures have nothing which\r\nmight not be found in an early reptile. There may be a single or even two\r\ncentralia in the reptilian tarsus among the early forms.\r\n\r\nThe amphibian nature of the species having thus been established,\r\nit remains to give a detailed account of its skeletal anatomy, with\r\ncomparative references to such other ancient forms as are available.\r\nLittle can be said of the vertebral column, since only the molds of a few\r\nvertebræ remain, and these are so obscured by a closely adherent pellicle\r\nof carbonaceous material that their form can not be distinctly discerned.\r\nThey are high, with relatively broad neural spines. There are no ribs\r\npreserved. The pelvis is obscured, but it is possible to determine the\r\npresence of an elongate ilium and an ischium. The leg of the left side\r\nis the best preserved of all the elements, and it is to this that our\r\nattention will be confined. The opposite leg is not so complete, yet all\r\nthe long bones and a part of the tarsus are preserved with sufficient\r\nclearness to corroborate the findings of the left side.\r\n\r\nThe femur, as has been stated, is reptilian in appearance. This is due\r\nto the well-rounded articular surfaces, as though the endochondrium were\r\nwell developed, and to the large development of the greater and lesser\r\ntrochanters, which are quite prominent, though these are distorted and\r\ndepressed in fossilization. The bone is stout and well built and its form\r\nsuggests an active habit of life. The tibia and fibula are separate, and\r\ndo not otherwise have sufficiently noteworthy characters to call for a\r\nspecial description in this place, except to note an unusual anterior\r\ncrest on the tibia. To the lower ends of these bones articulate the first\r\nrow of tarsal elements, the tibiale, intermedium, and fibulare. The tarsus\r\nis composed of 9 elements arranged in 3 rows. The proximal row is composed\r\nof the tibiale, the intermedium, and the fibulare. On the edge of the\r\ntibiale there lies a portion of one of the caudal vertebræ, so that the\r\nform of this tarsal element is slightly obscured. The intermedium is a\r\nsmall, rounded element lying between the larger elements. The fibulare is\r\nrectangular and projects a considerable distance out from the tibia, but\r\narticulates directly with the large lateral distal tarsal. The centrale\r\nis triangular in form and is opposed directly by the tibiale and tarsalia\r\n1 to 3. The phalanges are robust in appearance. The entire foot gives\r\none the impression of a very broad structure. The ungual phalanges were\r\napparently bluntly clawed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nSUPPOSED MICROSAURIAN SPECIES OF UNCERTAIN RELATIONSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following three species are so unusual and so incompletely known that\r\nthey can not be considered with any of the above families: _Brachydectes\r\nnewberryi_ Cope, Linton, Ohio; _Amblyodon problematicum_ Dawson, Nova\r\nScotia; _Proterpeton gurleyi_ Moodie, Danville, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus BRACHYDECTES Cope, 1868.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc.

II, p. 388, 1875), says:\r\n\r\n  \"This genus is indicated by two rami of a mandible and a portion of a\r\n  premaxillary only. These, when compared with those of _Œstocephalus_\r\n  and _Tuditanus_, from the same locality, and with others described by\r\n  authors, are so much stouter, i.e., shorter and more elevated, that\r\n  they evidently belong to a genus unlike either. The genus further\r\n  differs from _Œstocephalus_ in having the teeth of equal size to the\r\n  posterior part of the series; that is, to the base of the elevated\r\n  coronoid process. The teeth are elongate cylindrical cones, with their\r\n  acute tips turned a little posteriorly. The fractured ones display a\r\n  large pulp cavity. The three premaxillaries preserved are similar, but\r\n  without curvature at the tips. They do not exhibit striæ or any other\r\n  sculpture.\r\n\r\n  \"So far as the remains known go, the genus is nearer _Hylerpeton_\r\n  than any other. According to Dawson, that genus is provided with a\r\n  large canine-like tooth, at the anterior extremity of the maxillary,\r\n  on the inner row, which is inserted into a distinct socket. No such\r\n  tooth appears among those of this genus. The latter does not give any\r\n  indication of the very elevated coronoid process of _Brachydectes_,\r\n  though the external portion of the dentary bone in that region being\r\n  lost, little can be said about it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brachydectes newberryi Cope.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Proc.

II, pt II, p. 388, 1875) says of this form:\r\n\r\n  \"The species is represented by one nearly perfect ramus mandibuli, one\r\n  dentary bone and one premaxillary, probably not complete.\r\n\r\n  \"The dentary bone appears to have been attached by suture to the\r\n  articular and angular, as its free margin has very much of the outline\r\n  of that suture in _Amphiuma_ and lizards. The coronoid process\r\n  would also seem to be a part of the same bone as in _Amphiuma_ and\r\n  _Menopema_, and not composed of the coronoid bone as in lizards. It\r\n  rises immediately behind the last tooth, and displays no suture.\r\n\r\n  \"The lower portion of the dentary is prolonged into an acute angle.\r\n  This is separated by a deep and wide concavity from the superior\r\n  posterior prolongation, which is obtuse, and rises at once into the\r\n  coronoid process. Teeth on this dentary, seven; the same number is\r\n  on the preserved ramus; this number is suspected to be complete, or\r\n  nearly so. The teeth terminate at the obvious termination of each\r\n  ramus, which is, it is true, slightly obscured. These teeth are the\r\n  longest in the Microsauria in relation to the depth of the ramus,\r\n  equaling the largest in _Œstocephalus_. They are doubtless exposed,\r\n  as are some of those of the last-named genus, by the splitting away\r\n  of the outer parapet of the dentary bone. As no traces of alveoli\r\n  have been thus rendered visible I suspect the dentition to have been\r\n  acrodont, as in some existing Batrachia.\r\n\r\n  \"No external surface of the mandible remains, but there are no\r\n  impressions of sculpture on the matrix. A little external face of the\r\n  premaxillary displays none.\r\n\r\n  \"The species is dedicated to Professor John S.

In the\r\n  caudals the pleurocentra and hypocentra form complete rings, and both\r\n  elements take part in the support of the neural arch, but the hæmal\r\n  arch is borne exclusively by the hypocentra. A close abdominal armor\r\n  of imbricate scales, arranged in a chevron pattern. Caudal vertebræ\r\n  numerous. Chevrons coössified with the intercentra.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus SPONDYLERPETON Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Kans. Univ. Sci. Bull., vi. No. 2, p. 355, 1912.\r\n\r\nType: _Spondylerpeton spinatum_ Moodie.\r\n\r\nThe genus is based on a specimen consisting of 9 imperfect vertebræ,\r\nfrom the caudal region of a relatively large amphibian. The present\r\ngenus exceeds _Diplospondylus_ from the Gaskohle of Bohemia (251)\r\nby twice its size and is about two-thirds the size of _Cricotus\r\nheteroclitus_ Cope (98) from the Permian of Kansas. The vertebræ are\r\ntwice as high as wide, differing thus from _Cricotus_, in which the\r\nvertebræ are nearly circular. A character which is of great importance\r\nis the large size of the intercentrum, which almost equals the\r\npleurocentrum in size. It is similar to the pleurocentrum in shape,\r\nexcept for the attached neurocentrum and chevron on the latter. The\r\npresent genus differs from _Diplospondylus_ in the greater length of\r\nthe intercentrum and pleurocentrum, in the greater size, in the larger\r\nproportions of the neurocentrum, and the greater proportionate size of\r\nthe intercentra.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spondylerpeton spinatum Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Kans. Univ. Sci. Bull., VI, No. 2, pp. 355-357, pl. 8, figs. 1\r\n    and 2; pl. 9, fig. 1, 1912.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 793 (26) and obverse, Yale University Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Mazon Creek, near Morris, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe species is very imperfectly known. Sufficient is present, however, to\r\nshow its wide generic differences from other forms of the Cricotidæ. These\r\ncharacters are of a phylogenetic nature and indicate the more primitive\r\nnature of the present form, as we would expect from its geological\r\nposition. The sutures separating the four vertebral elements are clearly\r\napparent. The pleurocentral-neurocentral suture is apparent in 4 vertebræ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. The vertebræ of _Spondylerpeton spinatum_ Moodie,\r\nthe only known temnospondyle from the the Mazon Creek shales. × 1. _hy_,\r\nhypocentrum; _inc_, intercentrum; _pc_, pleurocentrum; _nc_, neurocentrum.]\r\n\r\nThere is but a single pleurocentrum preserved complete. This shows the\r\nform of the attached neurocentrum and chevron, which corresponds to the\r\nhypocentrum pleurale according to Fritsch. The pleurocentrum is flattened\r\nlaterally, with a rather large canal for the notochord. Its sides are\r\nmarked with 4 longitudinal grooves. Surfaces for the attachment of the\r\nribs are not present, and for this reason, as well as the presence of\r\nchevrons, the vertebræ are supposed to be caudals. As such they represent\r\nan animal of some 3 or 4 feet in length. It was the giant of the Mazon\r\nCreek Amphibia. (Plate 4, figs. 1, 2.)\r\n\r\nAttached to the upper side of pleurocentrum by a sutural union occurs\r\nthe neurocentrum. The neural arch is quite large and is oval in outline,\r\nalthough somewhat constricted at the tip. The spine of the neurocentrum is\r\nrather long and broad at the base, measuring 12 mm. across the anterior\r\nzygapophysis. The neurocentrum is laterally flattened and ends in a rather\r\nacute and somewhat rugose point. It was probably tipped with cartilage.\r\nThe anterior zygapophysis occurs well down on the neurocentrum, its lower\r\nedge being 5 mm. from the suture separating the pleurocentrum and the\r\nneurocentrum. The posterior zygapophysis occurs quite high up on the\r\nneurocentrum and lies at a distance of 15 mm. from the pleuro-neurocentral\r\nsuture, thus indicating an extreme posterior inclination of the neural\r\nspine. The posterior zygapophysis of the best preserved vertebra is\r\nseparated from its mate, the anterior zygapophysis, in the next succeeding\r\nvertebra by a space of 5 mm.\r\n\r\nThe ventral surface of the pleurocentrum bears a structure, which is,\r\nwithout doubt, a chevron, although the character of its opening can not\r\nbe determined. It is elongated and is united by a broad base to the\r\npleurocentrum. Its union is by a clearly defined suture, which is apparent\r\nin 3 vertebræ. The condition represented by the specimen duplicates almost\r\nexactly the condition figured by Cope for the caudal region of Cricotus\r\nCope.[D]\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: COPE, E. D., Trans. Am. Phil. Soc., XVI, p. 246, 1890.]\r\n\r\nThe intercentrum of the present form is fully as large as the\r\npleurocentrum. The significance of this has already been mentioned.

Case, 1908.=\r\n\r\n  Case, Annals Carnegie Mus., IV, p. 234, pl. 59, 1908.\r\n\r\nA dorsal vertebra is very probably from this genus. The specimen consists\r\nof a nearly perfect vertebra, lacking only the anterior zygapophysis and\r\nthe upper portion of the neural spine (plate 18, fig. 2). It shows no\r\ncharacter that would warrant its separation from the genus, and indicates\r\na medium-sized individual. The zygapophyses have clean-cut articular\r\nfaces. The pleurocentra are thickened above, with just well-defined\r\narticular faces, which were applied to faces on the neural arch posterior\r\nto the origin of the transverse process. The intercentrum is of the\r\nfamiliar halfmoon-shape, thick and heavy below, and thinner toward the\r\nextremities; the anterior edge is marked near the top by the indentation\r\nfound on the intercentra of _Eryops_.\r\n\r\nHeight of the vertebra from the middle of the lower face of the\r\nintercentrum to the middle of the neural canal, 0.035 m.; width of\r\nintercentrum 0.026 m.\r\n\r\nThe second recognizable specimen is a neural spine from the caudal series.\r\nThis is without question a portion of the skeleton of an Eryops. Similar\r\nspines were described by Cope as _Eryops (Epicordylus) erythrolithicus_,\r\nbut later discoveries seem to show that similar characters occur in other\r\nspecies of the genus as well. The apex of the spine is bifurcate; the\r\nspace between extremities is concave and perfectly smooth; below the sides\r\nof the spine are rather rugose and marked with ridges. The lower portion\r\nof the spine is elongated anteroposteriorly and the edges are marked with\r\nsharp, double ridges.\r\n\r\nThree ribs also belong, in all probability, to the genus _Eryops_. The\r\nhead of each rib is broad and the articular edge is divided between two\r\nfaces which meet at an angle somewhat greater than a right angle; the\r\ntwo faces are continuous. The shaft is somewhat flattened and in the\r\nundistorted specimens is gently curved. The length of the largest rib is\r\nabout 0.07 m.\r\n\r\nOther than these specimens there are several small intercentra (94) and\r\nthe neural spine of a caudal vertebra from some undetermined amphibian.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Family MACRERPETIDÆ Moodie, 1909.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., XXVI, art. XXV, p. 354, pl. lix,\r\n    fig. 1, 1909.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed necessary to propose a new family for the reception of the\r\nsingle species _Macrerpeton_ (_Tuditanus_) _huxleyi_ Cope. The characters\r\nexhibited by this species are so different from those offered by other\r\nmembers of the Carboniferous Microsauria that it is clearly distinct. In\r\nits cranial characters and the position of the orbits it approaches most\r\nnearly to _Eryops megacephalus_ Cope from the Permian of Texas. In some of\r\nits characters the present form shows a similarity to _Dasyceps bucklandi_\r\nLloyd (324), from the Permian of Kenilworth, England; more especially is\r\nthis similarity found in the form of the skull, the size and shape of the\r\nteeth, and the posterior position of the orbits, and their wide removal\r\nfrom the border of the skull. Only a fragment of the skull has hitherto\r\nbeen known, but repeated study of this fragment (123) has disclosed\r\nthe wide diversity (462) of its characters. An almost complete skull,\r\ndescribed below, substantiates the characters based on the fragment.\r\nAnother species is here added to the genus, based on a portion of a\r\nmandible and a portion of the skull.\r\n\r\nThe family, Macrerpetidæ, may be defined (465) as follows:\r\n\r\n  Skull larger than in any other known microsaurian, unless Baphetes\r\n  proves to be microsaurian; cranial elements sculptured with pits and\r\n  coarse grooves; lacrimal element present, teeth large, curved inwards\r\n  and fluted; mandible heavy; orbits located far back on the skull and\r\n  near the median line so that the interorbital space is about half the\r\n  space from the outer edge of the orbit to the border of the skull,\r\n  thus approaching the condition known in Eryops; the ribs (?) are\r\n  strong, heavy, and curved, with an incipient tubercle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus MACRERPETON Moodie, 1909.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Jour. Geol., XVII, No. 1, pp. 72-74, fig. 17, 1909.\r\n\r\nType: _Macrerpeton huxleyi_ Cope.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Macrerpeton_ was proposed for the reception of the amphibian\r\nspecies described by Cope as _Tuditanus huxleyi_ (123). This form he\r\nplaced provisionally in genus _Tuditanus_, since it seemed to present the\r\nsame type of sculpturing of the cranial elements similar to that found\r\nin _T. radiatus_ Cope. But this species has been removed from Tuditanus\r\nand placed in a new genus, _Erpetosaurus_ (462). A close study of the\r\ntype specimen of _Tuditanus huxleyi_ Cope shows (465) great variation and\r\ndistinction from any of the species described from Linton, Ohio, or indeed\r\nfrom any Carboniferous form thus far known.\r\n\r\nThe specimen represents the left side of the face, and the characters\r\nexhibited by the fragment are supported by more complete material (No.\r\n2933, Am. Mus. Nat. Hist.). The skull shows a close approach to the higher\r\nlabyrinthodonts in its shape. The orbits are far removed from the border\r\nof the skull. The arrangement of the bones of the skull resembles that\r\nof _Capitosaurus_ from the Keuper of Europe. The jaw is for the most\r\npart slender, with a pronounced downward inflection at the coronoidal\r\npart. The teeth are heavy and strong and are curved backwards. They\r\nhave the strong longitudinal fluting which is characteristic of the\r\nlabyrinthodonts. Another character which is distinctive is the pattern of\r\ncranial sculpture. This consists of inosculating pits and grooves of a\r\ncoarse character and compares favorably with the sculpturing of Triassic\r\nlabyrinthodonts. If _Macrerpeton_ really represents a labyrinthodont form\r\nof Amphibia it is the oldest of the known Labyrinthodontidæ, since it\r\nseems probable that the _Eosaurus_ vertebræ came from a higher horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Macrerpeton huxleyi Cope, 1874.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Trans.

Original in American Museum of Natural\r\n       History.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first part of the following account of the species, _Macrerpeton\r\nhuxleyi_ Cope, is a quotation of Cope's description (123) of the type\r\nspecimen, and the second part deals with the description of the new\r\nmaterial. Cope says the species is\r\n\r\n  \"Represented by a considerable portion of the face and muzzle of a\r\n  single individual. A portion of the left mandible, supporting three\r\n  teeth, remains in place, and almost the entire boundary of the right\r\n  orbit is preserved.\r\n\r\n  \"The fragment indicates a much larger species than any other referred\r\n  to the genus, and, next to the _Leptophractus obsoletus_, the largest\r\n  of the Batrachians of the Ohio Coal Measures. Without more complete\r\n  remains, it is not easy to determine its generic relations finally.\r\n\r\n  \"The form of the head is probably elongate, and the muzzle neither\r\n  very obtuse nor elongate. The orbit is rather small, and near the\r\n  middle of the length of the specimen, which is, however, incomplete at\r\n  both ends. The sculpture of the surface of the head posterior to the\r\n  orbits, as well as round their borders and for some distance in front\r\n  of them, consists of a rather coarse pitting. On the middle line,\r\n  between the orbits and on the muzzle, the intervals become narrower,\r\n  and are confluent into transverse ridges or a delicate reticulation.\r\n  The surface of the mandible displays a coarse reticulation.\r\n\r\n  \"The teeth are stoutly conic, and with delicately striate grooved\r\n  cementum. They are slightly recurved.\r\n\r\n  \"This species differs from the _T. radiatus_ and _T. obtusus_ in the\r\n  absence of the area into which the sculpture is thrown.\r\n\r\n  \"Longitudinal diameter of orbit, 19 mm.; length of alveolar border\r\n  supporting three teeth, 13 mm.; diameter of base of tooth, 3 mm.;\r\n  eight pits in 10 mm.\r\n\r\n  \"Dedicated to Professor T. H. Huxley, _facile princeps_ among English\r\n  systematists, and an important contributor to the knowledge of the\r\n  extinct Batrachia.\"\r\n\r\nThe following discussion of the cranial elements, based on the writer's\r\nstudies (462, 465) of the type, may be appended to Professor Cope's\r\noriginal description. The sutures bounding a few of the elements have\r\nbeen made out in part. The prefrontal element seems well assured. It lies\r\nwell in front of the orbit, much as in the skull of _Capitosaurus_ from the\r\nKeuper of Europe. The lacrimal is, apparently, a very large bone, though\r\nits entire extent is not assured.\r\n\r\nThe maxilla is a long, narrow element on the border of the skull. The\r\nsuture separating this from the lacrimal and jugal is quite clear. The\r\nteeth which the maxilla undoubtedly bore are hidden by the remains of the\r\nmandible, which lies partly on the edge of the skull. The jugal is a very\r\nlarge element and its boundaries seem well assured. Its size and relations\r\nrecall the condition in Capitosaurus. It forms a part of the external\r\nboundary of the orbit. The lateral suture of the postorbital is evident\r\nand is, as shown in the figure, somewhat curved. The remaining elements\r\npreserved on the fragmentary skull can not be accurately determined,\r\nthough their probable position is indicated in plate 30, fig. 2, the\r\nlettering being based on the arrangement of these elements in Capitosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw is poorly preserved, but what remains shows evidence of\r\nbeing sculptured somewhat after the manner of the cranial elements. It\r\nbore strong recurved teeth which are longitudinally striate.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type Specimen of Macrerpeton huxleyi Cope.\r\n\r\n                                mm.\r\n  Length of portion preserved   120\r\n  Maximum width of specimen      58\r\n  Length of orbit                20\r\n  Width of orbit                 14\r\n  Length of jaw, as preserved    75\r\n  Width of jaw at widest part    11\r\n  Length of longest tooth         8\r\n  Width of tooth at base          4\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Additional Material of Macrerpeton huxleyi.\r\n\r\nThe additional material of this species which has come to hand consists of\r\nan almost complete skull (American Museum No. 2933, two portions); another\r\nfragmentary skull (American Museum No. 8572 G and 8532 G); a portion of\r\nan interclavicle (American Museum No. 8006); two incomplete vertebræ\r\n(American Museum No. 8007); and another fragmentary element possibly\r\nrepresenting a scapula of this species (American Museum No. 8008).\r\n\r\nThe skull has essentially the shape outlined (462) from a study of the\r\nfragmentary type specimen. The muzzle was drawn slightly too broad, but\r\notherwise the restoration is fairly accurate. The specimen is distorted\r\nand imperfect, but enough is preserved to give a good idea of the shape\r\nand something of the structure of the skull. A portion of the obverse is\r\npreserved. The back part of the skull is broken, so that the occiput can\r\nnot be studied.\r\n\r\nThe length of the skull is one and two-fifths the greatest breadth (across\r\nthe orbits). The cranial elements are deeply marked with pits and short,\r\nshallow grooves. On the left mandible these pits are in a very distinct\r\nrow, the _operculo-mandibular lateral-line_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Macrerpeton deani new species.=\r\n\r\nType: Specimen No. 2934, American Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Linton, Ohio, Coal Measures. (Plate 21, figs. 1, 2.)\r\n\r\nThe material for this species consists of the posterior half of the left\r\nmandible and a portion of the right antero-lateral surface of the skull,\r\nboth incomplete. The reasons for regarding the species as distinct are the\r\nlarge size of the specimens and the manner of the sculpture, as well as\r\nthe shape of the posterior end of the mandible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Mandible of Macrerpeton deani new species, from\r\nLinton, Ohio. × 0.75.]\r\n\r\nThe present species is the largest amphibian of the Linton, Ohio, Coal\r\nMeasures, exceeding in skull length that of _Macrerpeton huxleyi_ by\r\ntwice. The largest skull of _Macrerpeton huxleyi_ which has so far\r\ncome under my notice is 120 mm. in median length. There are 3 skulls\r\nof this species known, all of approximately the same size. The skull\r\nof _Macrerpeton deani_ must have reached or exceeded a foot in median\r\nlength. The only species with which it can at all be compared are\r\n_Eobaphetes kansensis_ Moodie and _Baphetes planiceps_ Owen, but it\r\nis clearly distinct from all other genera of Linton Amphibia. It is\r\npossible that when better known _Macrerpeton_, _Eobaphetes_, _Baphetes_,\r\n_Erpetosaurus_, and possibly _Dendrerpeton_ will form a natural group of\r\nearly labyrinthodont-like Amphibia.\r\n\r\nThe mandible is similar in structure to that of the labyrinthodonts,\r\nwith the elements marked by radiate flutings. I can detect no evidences\r\nof a lateral-line canal, such as is clearly marked in _Macrerpeton\r\nhuxleyi_ Cope by a series of rounded pits, occupying the usual position\r\nof the operculo-mandibular lateral-line canal The teeth, of which 6 are\r\npreserved, are minutely striate, with smooth apices. They are dissimilar\r\nin size, showing a variation of 2 or 3 mm. in length.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture is a coarse fluting, with no indications of the sharply\r\nmarked pits of _Macrerpeton huxleyi_ Cope.\r\n\r\nThe fragment of a skull preserved shows characters of the sculpture which\r\nare identical with those of the mandible. The bones are so crushed that it\r\nis impossible to tell the limits of the elements. I believe a portion of\r\none orbit is represented on one corner of the block. The cranium appears\r\nto have been broad, and the fragment preserved, which is only about\r\none-sixth of the skull, is larger than the entire cranium and mandibles of\r\n_Macrerpeton huxleyi_.\r\n\r\nThe specific distinctness of the form can not be doubted, although it is a\r\nmatter of regret that it is founded on so small a portion of the osteology\r\nof the animal.\r\n\r\nThe species is proposed in honor of Dr. Bashford Dean, to whom I am\r\ngreatly indebted for many kindnesses during the past 5 years in connection\r\nwith my studies on Carboniferous Amphibia, particularly in the loan of the\r\nentire Newberry collection of Linton, Ohio, Amphibia.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Type of Macrerpeton deani Moodie.\r\n\r\n                                                      mm.\r\n  Length of portion preserved                         115\r\n  Greatest width                                       50\r\n  Length of tooth                                       9\r\n  Width at base                                         4\r\n  Length of angular                                    95\r\n  Diameter of angular                                  25\r\n  Measurements of specimen No. 8535 G, American Museum\r\n    of Natural History, associated with the above in\r\n    the type description:\r\n      Length of preserved portion                     140\r\n      Diameter of orbit                                22\r\n\r\n\r\n=Family ANTHRACOSAURIDÆ Cope, 1875.=\r\n\r\n  Cope, Bull.

The fossil is embedded\r\nin a mass of Pictou Coal from Nova Scotia and consists of the anterior\r\nextremity of the cranium (plate 22, fig. 6) and with the exterior surface\r\nof the bone embedded in the matrix, and its substance, for the most\r\npart, reduced to a thin layer by abrasion of the exposed inner layer. It\r\ndisplays accurately the contour of the fore part of the upper jaw, which\r\nwas broad, obtuse, and rounded.\r\n\r\nThe premaxillaries, which show some obscure traces of a symphysial suture\r\nat the median line, anterior to the nasal or naso-palatine vacuities,\r\nextend outwards, on each side, for an extent of 2.5 lines and there\r\njoin the maxillaries. Traces of round alveoli for teeth, some of which\r\nare 2 lines in diameter, are visible on the alveolar border of the\r\npremaxillaries. The alveolar border is continued by the maxillary bone for\r\nan extent of 4.5 inches beyond the premaxillary border, and this border\r\nshows still more distinct traces of alveoli, of a circular form, about a\r\nline in diameter and rather close set in a single series. The fore part\r\nof the orbit is very unequivocally displayed, the smooth inner or under\r\nsurface of the bone forming that part being entire; and this shows the\r\nfore part of the orbit to be formed, partly by the maxillary, partly\r\nby the lacrimal or prefrontal bone in close sutural union therewith,\r\na structure which does not exist in any recent or fossil fish with a\r\ndentigerous superior maxillary bone. Where the substance of the bone has\r\nbeen detached so far as to expose the external layer in contact with\r\nthe coal, as, _e.g._, on the frontal and part of the prefrontal bones,\r\nthe external surface of those bones is shown to have been impressed by\r\nsubhemispherical or elliptical pits, from 1 line to 1.5 lines in diameter,\r\nand with intervals of half of that extent. This coarsely pitted character\r\nagrees with that presented by the other surface of the similarly broad and\r\nflat cranium of the labyrinthodonts.\r\n\r\nFrom the characters above specified, therefore, I conclude that this\r\nfossil is the fore part of the skull of an extinct family of the\r\nlabyrinthodonts. It agrees with them in the number, size, and disposition\r\nof teeth; in the proportions and mode of connection of the premaxillaries,\r\nmaxillaries, nasals, prefrontals, and frontals, and in the resultant\r\npeculiarly broad and depressed character of the skull. The traces of\r\nthe nostrils are less definite and satisfactory than the remains of the\r\norbits, but the latter appear to be decisive against the piscine nature\r\nof the fossil. The fossil also presents the same well-marked external\r\nsculpturing as in the labyrinthodonts; and among the genera that have\r\nbeen established in that family, the form of the end of the muzzle, or\r\nupper jaw, in the Pictou coal specimen best accords with that in the\r\n_Capitosaurus_ and _Metopias_ of von Meyer and Burmeister (80).\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the Skull of Baphetes planiceps Owen.\r\n\r\n(Type in the British Museum of Natural History, London.)\r\n\r\n                                         mm.\r\n  Approximate median length of skull     136\r\n  Width of skull across base of horns    150\r\n  Estimated width across tips of horns   186\r\n  Width of horn at base                   31\r\n  Estimated length of horn from base      80\r\n  Width of skull across orbits            97\r\n  Diameter of orbit                       21\r\n  Diameter of large tooth alveolus         7\r\n  Diameter of small tooth alveolus         2\r\n\r\nPictou Coal, near Pictou, Nova Scotia, Canada, collected by Dr. J.

It measured 6 inches in length; its surface\r\nwas marked on the lower and posterior part with a network of ridges\r\ninclosing rounded depressions. The anterior part of the jaw contained\r\nabout 16 teeth, some of which remained in the matrix. These were stout,\r\nconical and blunt, with large pulp cavities, and about 32 longitudinal\r\nstriæ, corresponding to the folds of the dentine. Dawson states that this\r\njaw resembles most closely those of _Baphetes_ and _Dendrerpeton_, but more\r\nespecially the former.

Marsh's description (404) is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"The general form of the vertebræ is cylindrical, but their sides\r\n  are compressed obliquely, which gives to the contour of the centra a\r\n  subhexagonal appearance. They are much flattened in the direction of\r\n  the antero-posterior diameter, which has to the transverse diameter\r\n  the proportion of 1 to 3. Both the articular terminal facets are\r\n  deeply and equally concave; but from the center to the margin the\r\n  surfaces are convex, and this convexity is greatest near the center.\r\n  * * * The cavities for the reception of the intervertebral matter\r\n  begin immediately from the margin, and are considerably deeper\r\n  than the corresponding parts of the _Ichthyosaurus_, indicating a\r\n  greater degree of flexibility in the vertebral column. The margins\r\n  of the vertebra; are somewhat raised, as if they had yielded to a\r\n  forcible compression applied longitudinally; and hence the lateral\r\n  surfaces of the centers are concave in an antero-posterior direction.\r\n  This concavity is greater in the upper half of the vertebra and\r\n  was undoubtedly more marked originally than at present, since the\r\n  appearance of the margins indicates considerable abrasion. The\r\n  non-articular surfaces of the centra are smooth and regular; and the\r\n  external fibres of the osseous tissue are singularly reticulated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.

These depressions are\r\n  situated on the superior surface of the centrum intermediate between\r\n  the anterior and posterior margins of the extremities. They are\r\n  circular in form and sink directly into the body of the vertebra;\r\n  instead of being elongated longitudinally and raised by ridges, as\r\n  in _Ichthyosaurus_. The pits are about a line in depth, and in the\r\n  more perfect of the fossils are not in their original position. The\r\n  floor of the spinal canal is narrow, being but 5 lines in breadth. A\r\n  rudimentary transverse process, or exogenous tubercle, is sent off\r\n  from each lateral surface of the centrum, at points equidistant from\r\n  the extremities of the vertical diameter. Their position is near the\r\n  margin of the anterior articular surface, and the edges of these\r\n  parapophyses make the transverse diameter of this extremity somewhat\r\n  greater than that of the corresponding posterior facet.\"\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the More Perfect Vertebra of Eosaurus acadianus (after\r\nMarsh).\r\n\r\n                                                      mm.\r\n  Transverse diameter of centrum on anterior surface  59\r\n  Same on posterior surface                           57\r\n  Same including the parapophyses                     63\r\n  Vertical diameter of anterior surface               54\r\n  Anteroposterior diameter on superior surface        21\r\n  Same on inferior surface                            19\r\n  Same between centers of articular facets             2.5\r\n  Length of pits for articulation of neural arch       7\r\n  Breadth of same                                      7\r\n  Depth of same                                        2\r\n  Distance between centers of same                    11\r\n  Same at centers of parapophyses                     36\r\n\r\nCollected by O. C. Marsh at the South Joggins, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nMarsh regarded (404) the vertebræ as representing a new type of\r\nichthyosaurian (2), but there can be no doubt that the vertebræ belong\r\nto some form of the Amphibia, since the description applies equally well\r\nto them. In this connection mention must be made of a large rib from the\r\nLinton beds preserved in the U. S. National Museum. Only the proximal\r\nthird of the rib is preserved, but it represents some large form of the\r\nStegocephala. The rib is strongly curved backward, is heavy, and has an\r\nincipient tubercle. A cross-section shows that a longitudinal groove\r\noccupies the median line on the exposed surface of the rib. This may,\r\nhowever, be due to compression and thus indicate that the rib was hollow.\r\nThe rib as preserved measures: length, 102 mm.; maximum width, 22 mm.;\r\nminimum width, 14 mm. (Nos. 4490, 4489, U. S. National Museum.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus EOBAPHETES new name.=\r\n\r\nType: _Eobaphetes kansensis_ Moodie.\r\n\r\nThe new name is proposed to replace the generic term _Erpetosaurus_ used\r\nfor the species _E. kansensis_ described by the writer (Proc. U. S. Nat.\r\nMus., 39, p. 491, 1911), and which later was found to be preoccupied by\r\nNewton (Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. London, 185, p. 573, 1894 B).\r\n\r\nThe genus is very readily distinguished by two prominent characters the\r\nshort, uniform dentition and the presence of two elongate, oval, internal\r\nmandibular foramina on the inner side of the jaw. The genus may be further\r\ndistinguished by the great depth of the posterior portion of the jaw and\r\nthe slender anterior part, as well as by the ornamentation, which is\r\ntypically the rough tuberculated labyrinthodont sculpture on the anterior\r\nend of the mandible. This changes gradually to longitudinal grooves and\r\nridges of a rather small size on the posterior portion, a very unusual\r\narrangement for a labyrinthodont.\r\n\r\nThese characters are sustained by those of the skull fragment, in\r\nwhich the dentition is uniform and the sculpture very similar to that\r\nof the mandible. The ribs are long, curved, and solid, as in other\r\nlabyrinthodonts.\r\n\r\nThe internal surface of the mandible shows much similarity to that of the\r\ncrocodiles and alligators of the present day. The resemblance is not due\r\nto homology of structures, but must be regarded as a parallel development\r\nof similar characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eobaphetes kansensis Moodie.=\r\n\r\n  Moodie, Proc. U.

National Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Coal Measures of Washington County, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe species is represented in the collections of the U. S. National Museum\r\nby a fragment of the skull, with portions of two ribs (Cat. No. 6699,\r\nVert. Pal. U. S. Nat. Mus.) and the larger part of the left ramus of the\r\nmandible (Cat. No. 6680, Vert. Pal. U. S. Nat. Mus.). The mandible was\r\npreserved in a large block of coal which contained the impression of the\r\nback portion of the mandible from which the bone had been weathered. It\r\nwas possible to remove the bone and make a plaster cast of the impression.\r\nThis shows in a very satisfactory manner all of the characters of the\r\nexternal surface.\r\n\r\n_Skull._--Only a portion of the left maxilla, with 14 teeth, and a part of\r\nthe nasal are preserved. The skull seems to have been laterally crushed\r\nand the right side of the skull has been crushed flat under the left. It\r\nhas not seemed feasible to remove the skull from the matrix.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are uniform, rather short, bluntly conical, curved backward, and\r\ncoarsely striate. They are somewhat crowded, the bases being separated\r\nfrom each other by only a fraction of a millimeter.\r\n\r\nThe maxilla and portion of the nasal are coarsely sculptured with elongate\r\npits and ridges. A portion of the infraorbital lateral-line canal is\r\npreserved. It is simply a rounded groove with three short branches. It\r\nlies near the middle of the maxilla.\r\n\r\n_Mandible._--It has been possible to study both sides of the mandible.\r\nThe left ramus was preserved in the coal, with its inner face exposed.\r\nThis face is broken by two large oval openings, the internal mandibular\r\nforamina. This is the term used by Reynolds for the openings on the inner\r\nsurface of the alligator jaw. So far as I can ascertain, no other known\r\nlabyrinthodont mandible displays this character in such a marked degree.\r\nDr. Branson has figured in _Anaschisma browni_ Branson from the Triassic\r\n(49) of Wyoming the inner surface of the left ramus, on which there are\r\nlikewise two openings but differently situated. A similarity between the\r\ntwo mandibles is observed in that the suture separating the prearticular\r\nand angular touches the posterior edge of the posterior foramen.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the sutures are well preserved and they have been indicated\r\nin the drawing (fig. 42). The pillar separating the two foramina is cut\r\nby the suture separating the angular and prearticular very much as in\r\n_Anaschisma_, with the difference that in the latter form the angular\r\nand prearticular are not approximated. I believe I detect the suture as\r\nrepresented separating the anterior end of the angular from the dentary\r\nand splenial. I am assured of the portion near the anterior foramen and\r\nalso of the part near the tip of the ramus. This shows the angular to be\r\na very elongate element, running very nearly the entire length of the\r\nmandible, much as in _Anaschisma_ and other labyrinthodont genera. The\r\nsplenial is a small, slender element located farther forward, where it\r\nhas been shoved by the large-sized internal mandibular foramina. The\r\nprearticular is a rather long, broad element, of which only a portion is\r\npreserved. I am not sure as to the location of the suture for the dentary,\r\nunless it is represented by the line bounding the roughened area near the\r\nteeth. If this is true, the dentary is a large element, since it extends\r\nwell down upon the outer side of the jaw. The dentary possesses evidences\r\nof 26 teeth, a few of which are completely preserved. Most of them are,\r\nhowever, represented either by bases or by impressions in the coal. The\r\nteeth are very similar to those of the maxilla, though slightly larger.\r\nThe characters given for the maxillary teeth will suffice for those of the\r\ndentary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.\r\n\r\n  A.

Horizon\r\nand locality: Coal formation at South Joggins, Nova Scotia. (Plate 6.)\r\nThis species has been fully described and figured by Dawson (Air-breathers\r\nof the Coal Period, pp. 17-30, pl. III, figs. 1 to 30, 1863), who gives\r\na detailed account of the discovery of the material of this species by\r\nhimself and Sir Charles Lyell. He says, in part:\r\n\r\n  \"In form, _Dendrerpeton acadianum_ was probably lizard-like; with a\r\n  broad flat head, short, stout limbs and an elongated tail; and having\r\n  its skin, and more particularly that of the belly, protected by small\r\n  bony plates closely overlapping each other. It may have attained\r\n  the length of 2 feet. The form of the head is not unlike that of\r\n  _Baphetes_, but longer in proportion; and much resembles that of the\r\n  labyrinthodont reptiles of the Trias. The bones of the skull are\r\n  sculptured as in _Baphetes_, but in a smaller pattern. The nostrils\r\n  are small, and near the muzzle; the orbits are circular, and separated\r\n  by a space of more than their own diameter. In the upper jaw there is\r\n  a series of conical teeth on the maxillary and intermaxillary bones.\r\n  Those on the intermaxillaries are much larger than the others, and\r\n  have the aspect of canines or tusks. Within this outer series of\r\n  teeth, but implanted apparently in the same bones, there is as in\r\n  _Archegosaurus_ a second series of teeth, closely placed, or with\r\n  intervals equal to the diameter of one tooth. These inner teeth are\r\n  longer than the others, implanted in shallow sockets, to which they\r\n  are anchylosed, and have the dentine plicated, except toward the\r\n  point. A third group of teeth, blunt at the points, largely hollow in\r\n  the interior, and with the dentine quite simple, appears in detached\r\n  bones, which may represent the vomer. Only a part of this formidable\r\n  armature of the teeth appears in the skull, as the bones of the roof\r\n  of the mouth have been removed, adhering to the opposite side of\r\n  the matrix; but the fact of the occurrence of two sets of teeth was\r\n  ascertained by Professor Wyman, from the original specimens, and is\r\n  manifest in the fragment * * * while the other teeth, supposed to\r\n  be vomerine, appear in fragments which must, from their size and\r\n  collocation, have belonged to _Dendrerpeton_. It will be observed\r\n  that all of these teeth are anchylosed to the bone; and that those\r\n  of the vomer are thinly walled and simple, the outer series on the\r\n  maxillaries and intermaxillaries simple and flattened, while the inner\r\n  series of teeth are conical and plicated. In the lower jaw there was\r\n  a uniform series of conical teeth, not perceptibly enlarged toward\r\n  the front; at least this is the case in the only specimen at present\r\n  in my collection; which is, however, merely an imperfect cast in hard\r\n  sandstone.\r\n\r\n  \"The scapular and sternal bones seem to have been well developed and\r\n  strong, but only portions of them are known. The fore limb of the\r\n  adult animal, including the toes, must have been 4 or 5 inches in\r\n  length, and is of massive proportions. The bones are hollow, and in\r\n  the case of the phalanges the bony walls were thin, so that they are\r\n  often found crushed flat. The humerus, however, was a strong bone,\r\n  with thick walls and a cancellated structure toward its extremities;\r\n  still, even these have sometimes yielded to the great pressure to\r\n  which they have been subjected. The cavity of the interior of the\r\n  limb-bones is usually filled with calc-spar stained with organic\r\n  matter, but showing no structure; and the inner side of the bony wall\r\n  is smooth, without any indications of cartilaginous matter lining it.\r\n\r\n  \"The vertebræ, in the external aspect of their bodies, remind one of\r\n  those of fishes, expanding toward the extremities, and being deeply\r\n  hollowed by conical cavities, which appear even to meet in the center.\r\n  There is, however, a large and flattened neural spine. The vertebræ\r\n  are usually much crushed, and it is almost impossible to disengage\r\n  them from the stone. * * * in its long neural and hæmal spines,\r\n  reminds us of the caudal vertebræ of those batrachians and reptiles\r\n  which have tails flattened for swimming, and probably indicates that\r\n  this was the case with _Dendrerpeton_. The ribs are long and curved,\r\n  with an expanded head, near to which they are solid, but become\r\n  hollow toward the middle; and the distal extremities are flattened\r\n  and thin-walled. The posterior seems to have been not larger than\r\n  the anterior, perhaps smaller. The tibia is much flattened at the\r\n  extremity, as in some labyrinthodonts, and the foot must have been\r\n  broad, and probably suited for swimming or walking on soft mud, or\r\n  both. That the hind limb was adapted for walking is shown not merely\r\n  by the form of the bones, but also by that of the pelvis, the best\r\n  preserved specimen of which I have represented (208, pl. III, fig. 28).\r\n\r\n  \"The external scales are thin, oblique-rhomboidal or elongated-oval,\r\n  marked with slight concentric lines, but otherwise smooth, and\r\n  having a thickened ridge or margin; in which they resemble those\r\n  of _Archegosaurus_, and also those of _Pholidogaster_. * * * The\r\n  microscopic structure of the scales is quite similar to that of the\r\n  other bones, and different from that of the scales of ganoid fishes\r\n  * * * .\" #/\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dendrerpeton oweni Dawson.=\r\n\r\n  Dawson, Quart.

The form (plate 13) is fully\r\ndescribed by Dawson (Air-breathers of the Coal Period, p. 32, pl. IV,\r\n1863) as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Among the reptilian remains found in erect trees at the South\r\n  Joggins, there have occurred several portions of skeletons which, from\r\n  their sculptural cranial bones, plicated teeth, and the forms of their\r\n  scales and limb-bones, I have referred to the genus _Dendrerpeton_,\r\n  but to individuals of much smaller size than the full-grown specimens\r\n  of _D. acadianum_. It did not occur to me to suppose that these were\r\n  specifically distinct from the larger individuals, until I observed\r\n  that bones of this kind, contained in the collections sent by me\r\n  to the Geological Society, or represented in the figures drawn to\r\n  illustrate one of my papers, were referred by Professor Owen, in his\r\n  notes on these specimens and figures, in the Journal of the Geological\r\n  Society, to the genus _Hylonomus_; which is quite distinct from\r\n  _Dendrerpeton_, as will be explained in sequel.\r\n\r\n  \"I was thus induced to reexamine all the specimens in my collection\r\n  and the result has been to establish a strong probability that there\r\n  is in reality a second species of Dendrerpeton, smaller than _D.\r\n  acadianum_, and differing from it in several points. This species I\r\n  propose to name _D. oweni_. It differs from _D. acadianum_ in the\r\n  following particulars: (i) its much smaller size; (2) its long and\r\n  hooked teeth (it will be seen that these teeth differ very markedly\r\n  in their proportions and form from those of the larger species);(3)\r\n  the greater plication of the ivory in the intermaxillary teeth (in\r\n  _D. acadianum_ these teeth are, on the outside, simple almost to the\r\n  base, and plicated on the inner side, while in this species they are\r\n  plicated all around like the inner maxillary teeth);(4) the form of\r\n  the skull, which has the orbits larger in proportion, and is also\r\n  shorter and broader. On the other hand, when we have described the\r\n  species Hylonomus, it will be seen that this animal, except in size,\r\n  differs from them quite as widely as does _D. acadianum_.\r\n\r\n  \"The distinctness of _D. oweni_ is further confirmed by the fact that\r\n  I possess small jaw-bones of _Dendrerpeton_, about the size of those\r\n  of this species, but having the teeth similar in form to those of the\r\n  larger species; these I suppose to have belonged to young individuals.\r\n\r\n  \"On examining the figures (208, pl. IV) it will be seen that the\r\n  bones of the skull were corrugated as in the large _Dendrerpeton_,\r\n  but with a smaller pattern. The forms of the jaw-bones also, and\r\n  of the vertebræ, ribs, scapular bone, bones of the limbs, and bony\r\n  scales, are very similar, and indicate that in general form this\r\n  creature was not far removed from its larger relative. The bones\r\n  of the foot especially deserve attention. This is the most perfect\r\n  foot of _Dendrerpeton_ hitherto found; and I have enlarged it in the\r\n  figure (208) in order more distinctly to show its parts. It presents\r\n  three long toes with traces of a smaller one at each side, so that\r\n  there were probably five in all. If these toes be compared with the\r\n  footprints on the slab discovered by Dr. Harding, it will be seen that\r\n  they very closely correspond, though the toes of the present species\r\n  are much smaller. The footprints are precisely those which we may\r\n  suppose an animal of the size of _Dendrerpeton acadianum_ would have\r\n  made if, as the bones found render in every way probable, this larger\r\n  species had a foot similar to that of _D. oweni_. I suppose, for\r\n  this reason, that these footprints are really those of Dendrerpeton\r\n  acadianum and that this species continued to exist from the time of\r\n  the lower Coal Measures to the period when those higher beds of the\r\n  series, in which its bones are found at the Joggins, were deposited.\r\n\r\n  \"The present species must have lived in the same places with its\r\n  larger relative, but may have differed somewhat in its habits. Its\r\n  longer and sharper teeth may have been better suited for devouring\r\n  worms, larvæ, or soft-skinned fishes, while those of the larger\r\n  _Dendrerpeton_ were better adapted to deal with the mailed ganoids of\r\n  the period, or with those smaller reptiles which were more or less\r\n  protected with bony or horny scales.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAINS OF SKIN AND HORNY SCALES.\r\n\r\n  \"In one of my earliest explorations of the reptile-bearing stumps of\r\n  the Joggins, I observed on some of the surfaces patches of a shining\r\n  black substance, which on minute examination proved to be the remains\r\n  of cuticle, with horny scales and other appendages. The fragments\r\n  were preserved; but I found it impossible to determine with certainty\r\n  to which of the species whose bones occur with them they belonged,\r\n  or even to ascertain the precise relations of the several fragments\r\n  to each other. I therefore merely mentioned them in general terms,\r\n  and stated my belief that they may have belonged to the species of\r\n  _Hylonomus_.[E] More recently other specimens have been obtained, and\r\n  I have undertaken the detailed examination of the whole. I shall now\r\n  endeavor to describe the principal or most continuous fragments, and\r\n  afterward to consider the probabilities of their having belonged to\r\n  certain of the reptiles entombed with them. I do this here, rather\r\n  than under the titles of these several animals, on account of the\r\n  uncertainty which still rests on the assignment of certain portions\r\n  of this cuticle to the species in question, and which renders it more\r\n  convenient to consider these peculiar remains in one place and to\r\n  compare the different portions with each other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Journal of Geological Society, vol. XVI.]\r\n\r\n  \"(1) One of my specimens is a flattened portion of cuticle 2.25\r\n  inches in length. The greater part of the surface is smooth and\r\n  shining to the naked eye, and under the microscope shows only a\r\n  minute granulation. A limited portion of the upper and, I suppose,\r\n  anterior part is covered with imbricated scales, which must have been\r\n  membranous or horny and generally have a small spot or pore near the\r\n  outer margin, some having in addition smaller scales or points on\r\n  their surfaces. In contact with the upper part of this specimen there\r\n  were many fragments of the skull of _Dendrerpeton oweni_.\r\n\r\n  \"(2) Another portion of the cuticle, similarly marked, appears to\r\n  preserve the form of the posterior part of the body and tail of the\r\n  animal, and also a mark representing the point of attachment of the\r\n  hind leg; near to which, and along the dorsal ridge, is a portion of\r\n  the skin covered with much smaller scales. This was found in close\r\n  proximity to a mass of bones of Dendrerpeton oweni, mingled with some\r\n  of _Hylonomus lyelli_.\r\n\r\n  \"(3) A third and still larger surface of integument with similar\r\n  markings has upon it a number of vertebræ and detached bones of the\r\n  small reptile _Hylonomus wymani_, to be described in the sequel; for\r\n  which species, however, it would be much too large a covering.\r\n\r\n  \"(4) Another well-preserved fragment, less than 2 inches in length,\r\n  exhibits very different markings. It is nearly covered with very small\r\n  imbricated scales, thicker than those on the specimens previously\r\n  described. On either side of what seems to have been the middle line\r\n  of the back, there is a series of pointed flat horny processes, which\r\n  probably formed a double spinous crest. Without these there are tufts\r\n  of strong bristles, and exteriorly to these last are rows of flat,\r\n  thick, horny plates, transversely wrinkled. Near to these was a row of\r\n  conical truncated tubercles. Sections of these appendages show them to\r\n  have been horny and attached to the cuticle. None of them have bony\r\n  structure.\r\n\r\n  \"(5) Near this last portion of cuticle, and possibly belonging to\r\n  it, are pointed and probably membranous appendages, marked on each\r\n  side with rows of scales not overlapping and each with a pore in its\r\n  center. The manner in which these appendages are bent and wrinkled\r\n  shows that they must have been soft, except at the tips, which seem\r\n  to have been hard and horny, and they are arranged in series, as if\r\n  originally placed along the sides of the neck or abdomen, or both.\r\n  The use of these appendages is not easy to conjecture. They remind\r\n  us of the gular pouches of iguana, and of the lateral expansions of\r\n  some geckos and of the _Draco volans_. Possibly they formed lateral\r\n  parachutes, aiding the animal in moving over soft mud, or perhaps in\r\n  leaping and swimming.\r\n\r\n  \"(6) Some other fragments appear to have belonged to a different\r\n  species from either of the foregoing. The best preserved specimen,\r\n  which is about 1 inch in length and half an inch in breadth, is\r\n  covered with very small imbricated scales. It is crossed by 6 or 7\r\n  obscure ridges, which both at the bottom and along a mesial line\r\n  project into points covered with larger scales. A row of large scales\r\n  with round pores connects these along the lower side. If, as seems\r\n  probable, this fragment belonged to the side of the trunk or tail,\r\n  it would perhaps indicate a division of the subcutaneous muscles\r\n  into an upper and lower band, as in the newts. A separate fragment\r\n  with transverse horny ridges and another with a longer lobe, similar\r\n  in structure to those above mentioned, may perhaps be referred to\r\n  the same animal. A larger patch of skin presents similar imbricated\r\n  scales, but without a mesial line, and with an edging of larger scales.\r\n\r\n  \"Six species of reptiles have left their bones in the repositories\r\n  containing these remnants of cuticle. Of these, _Dendrerpeton\r\n  acadianum_, was an animal of too great size to have been clothed\r\n  with integument of this character and of such dimensions. Hylonomus\r\n  aciedentatus and _Hylerpeton dawsoni_ are each represented by only a\r\n  single specimen, and these did not occur in proximity to any of the\r\n  portions of cuticle, except that the appendages were found near a\r\n  specimen of the former. Of the three remaining species, _Dendrerpeton\r\n  oweni_, from its size, the number of specimens found, and the\r\n  juxtaposition of their bones to the fragments of cuticle, appears to\r\n  have the best claim to the integument included under Nos. 1, 2, and\r\n  3; and in this case, while the creature had its throat, and perhaps\r\n  its abdomen, armed with bony scales, its upper parts and tail, as well\r\n  as its limbs, had a uniform covering of small, thin imbricated horny\r\n  scales, in the manner of many modern reptiles.\r\n\r\n  \"If the remaining portions of integument, Nos. 4 and 5, as would\r\n  seem likely, belonged to two species, both of smaller dimensions,\r\n  there would seem little reason to doubt that these were _Hylonomus\r\n  lyelli_ and _H. wymani_. In this case, both of these species must have\r\n  possessed a highly ornate covering of horny scales and appendages,\r\n  comparable with that of many of the modern lizards, while there\r\n  seems good reason to believe, as stated in a previous paper, that\r\n  they were in part protected by bony scales somewhat like those of\r\n  _Dendrerpeton_. These points, however, we shall consider more in\r\n  detail under the sections which refer to the species of _Hylonomus_.\r\n\r\n  \"Before leaving these curious specimens of ancient skin, the most\r\n  ancient I suppose known to exist, it is of interest to observe that\r\n  the thicker portions, when broken across, have the aspect of jet, or\r\n  of pure shining coal, and thin slices, under the microscope, have\r\n  the same rich brown colour with that material, though rather more\r\n  translucent. When burned, fragments of the substance give a strong\r\n  flame, and a bituminous and ammoniacal odour. We have thus an example\r\n  of the production of coal from animal membrane, no doubt gelatinous\r\n  and horny in the first instance, but which has proved itself capable\r\n  of the same chemical changes that have been experienced by the\r\n  vegetable matter buried with it. In order that this substance should\r\n  be preserved in this way, it would be necessary that it should either\r\n  be kept dry and hard, or that it should be immediately buried in\r\n  matter impervious to air and kept moist. The latter conditions are\r\n  the more probable. The preservative qualities of the peaty vegetable\r\n  matter imbedded with it must be considered; and it is possible that\r\n  these hollow stumps, partly filled with fragments of _Sigillaria_\r\n  bark, may have formed natural tan-pits, in which animal membranes\r\n  would be preserved in a manner impossible in ordinary sediments. If\r\n  this were the case, we may yet find an entire reptile, preserved as a\r\n  flattened mummy, in one of these strange repositories.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Genus PLATYSTEGOS Dawson, 1895.=\r\n\r\n  Dawson, Proc. and Trans.

Tail unknown, possibly\r\n  short. Limbs and girdles well developed (243), phalangeal formula\r\n  unknown; carpus osseous and tarsus unknown. Pectoral girdle composed\r\n  of osseous scapulæ, clavicles, interclavicle, coracoid (?); clavicles\r\n  and interclavicle ventrally sculptured. Pelvic girdle composed of\r\n  osseous pubis, ischium, and ilium (242), the pubis a small plate, in\r\n  life largely cartilaginous, the three uniting by cartilaginous union\r\n  to form the acetabulum. Ventral armature unknown, possibly wanting.\r\n\r\nRange: Pennsylvanian to Upper Triassic.\r\n\r\nDistribution: North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Family MASTODONSAURIDÆ Huxley, 1863.=\r\n\r\n  Huxley, Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc., XIX, p. 65, 1863.\r\n\r\n  Lydekker, R., Cat. Fossil Reptilia Amphibia, pt. IV, p. 141, 1890.\r\n\r\n  Skull triangular, and more or less elongated, with the cranial bones\r\n  very strongly sculptured, the occipital condyles ossified (49), and\r\n  large palatal vacuities; dentine of teeth with very complex plications\r\n  (502); no bony rings (242) in sclerotic; and no ventral scutes.\r\n  Bodies of vertebræ (49) fully ossified in the adult. There are large\r\n  palato-vomerine tusks on the inner side of the maxillary teeth; and\r\n  the palatines run parallel to the maxilla. The mandible has a large\r\n  postarticular process; and there is a small inner series of mandibular\r\n  teeth. In the type genus the pubes are separate from the ischia, and\r\n  do not enter into the formation of the acetabulum; and the sacral ribs\r\n  form kidney-shaped disks (393).\r\n\r\nRepresented in North America by a single tooth from the Carboniferous of\r\nKansas. Described by Williston as Mastodonsaurus sp. (Kans. Univ. Quart.,\r\nVI, pp. 209-210, pl. XXI). Represented in the Triassic of Wyoming by\r\nAnaschisma browni, Branson (49).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mastodonsaurus sp. indet.=\r\n\r\n  Williston, Kans. Univ. Quart., VI, p. 209, 1897.\r\n\r\nThe specimen preserved comprises the entire crown of a single vomerine (?)\r\ntooth, 38 mm. in length by 14 mm. in diameter at base (pl. 21, fig. 6).\r\nThe immediate tip had been partly worn away in life, but was acuminate.\r\nIt is composed of a dense blackish material, with the exterior smooth,\r\nshining black. It has about 20 narrow flutings, nearly straight, running\r\nfrom the base to the tip, separating shallow grooves. A transverse section\r\nof the base shows a narrow pulp-cavity not more than 5 mm. in diameter\r\nwhich extends in about the same proportional width to beyond the middle of\r\nthe tooth, and in all probability to near the apex. The cross-section of\r\nthe tooth throughout is nearly or quite circular.\r\n\r\nA hemisection of the tooth was made near the middle, showing a structure\r\nmost remarkably like that of _Mastodonsaurus_; so nearly alike, in fact,\r\nthat there is no difference from the large figure given by Owen of a\r\nsection of _Mastodonsaurus_ (502).\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this tooth in the Kansas Coal Measures is of great\r\ninterest, proving, as it does, the presence of true labyrinthodonts from\r\na lower horizon than elsewhere recorded. The discovery of _Eobaphetes\r\nkansensis_ Moodie in the Carboniferous of Washington County (473) would\r\nseem to indicate another labyrinthodont. The tooth from Louisville was\r\npossibly not the first evidence of labyrinthodonts in North America, since\r\nthe discovery by Marsh of _Eosaurus acadianus_ from the Coal Measures\r\nof Nova Scotia, possibly a member of the Stereospondylia, antedates\r\nthis discovery 30 years. The specimen is preserved in the Museum at the\r\nUniversity of Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHIBIAN FOOTPRINTS FROM THE COAL MEASURES.\r\n\r\nFootprints may be said to be fairly common in the Coal Measures of North\r\nAmerica. Especial attention has been given to the classification of these\r\nobjects by G. F. Matthew (408-413), Dawson (208-210) and others. Hay (317,\r\npp. 538-553) has given a catalogue of all the species described from\r\nthe Coal Measures of North America, to which the reader is referred for\r\nfurther information in regard to these interesting evidences of former\r\nanimal activities. The writer has not been interested in the taxonomy\r\nof footprints, but has studied such as have come to his notice (465). A\r\ndescription of the species _Dromopus agilis_ Marsh (fig. 43) is given\r\nhere, because there is a large slab in the University of Kansas Museum\r\nwhich has not been figured. Since the chief interest in the present\r\ncontribution is morphology, footprints are thus scantily dealt with. Leidy\r\n(374), Dawson (207), Moodie (465, pl. LXIV, fig. 1) and others have given\r\nvarious brief descriptions of Coal Measures footprints, probably all of\r\nwhich are evidences of Amphibia which are otherwise unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dromopus agilis Marsh.=\r\n\r\n  Marsh, Jour. Sci. (3), XLVIII, p. 82, pl. ii, fig. 3; pl. iii, fig. 3,\r\n    1894.\r\n\r\n  Hay, Bull. U. S. Geol. Surv., No. 179, p. 543, 1902.\r\n\r\nType: Specimen in the Yale University Museum.\r\n\r\nHorizon and locality: Osage limestone (Coal Measures), near Osage City,\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Professor Marsh described a collection of footprints which\r\nhe had secured from Professor B. F. Mudge, of Manhattan, Kansas, who\r\nhad collected them in Osage County, Kansas, in a rock quarry, having\r\npurchased a large quantity of rock from the quarrymen for that purpose. A\r\npreliminary note by Mudge (490) was published in the Transactions of the\r\nKansas Academy of Science and later copied in the American Journal of\r\nScience. Professor Marsh's description (406) of the remains is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"The impressions are well preserved in a calcareous shale, which\r\n  separates readily into thin slabs, each representing a surface of\r\n  the beach at the time the footprints were made upon it. A few shells\r\n  in the shale are sufficient to prove that the formation is marine\r\n  (no shells are evident in the slab at the Museum of the University\r\n  of Kansas, but the slab is quite arenaceous). Trails of annelids, or\r\n  perhaps of other invertebrates, are seen on some of the surfaces.\r\n  The footprints of vertebrate animals, however, are of paramount\r\n  importance, and the large number and variety of these here recorded\r\n  on a single surface, if they could be rightly interpreted, would form\r\n  an interesting chapter of land vertebrate life in the Carboniferous,\r\n  about which so little is at present known.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Footprints of _Dromopus agilis_ Marsh, from the\r\nCoal Measures of Osage County, Kansas. Original slab in University of\r\nKansas Museum. Greatly reduced.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh's description of _Dromopus agilis_ is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"The third series of footprints is of special interest, and indicates\r\n  an animal very distinct from the two already described. The diagram\r\n  represents the impression of the phalanges sufficiently in detail to\r\n  indicate (406) their number and general form. A striking feature in\r\n  the fore and hind feet of this animal was the long, slender digits\r\n  terminated by sharp claws. Another point of interest, as recorded in\r\n  the footprints, is that the animal in walking swung the hind feet\r\n  outward, and so near the ground that the ends of the longer toes\r\n  sometimes made trails in the mud, marking accurately the sweep of the\r\n  foot. This would seem to indicate a comparatively short hind leg,\r\n  rather than the long, slender one which the footprints themselves\r\n  naturally suggest.\r\n\r\n  \"The animal which made these interesting footprints was probably a\r\n  Lacertilian rather than an Amphibian, but there is also a possibility\r\n  that it was a primitive Dinosaur.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on Professor Marsh remarks (p. 84):\r\n\r\n  \"So far as at present known, land vertebrate life began in the\r\n  Carboniferous age, no footprints of other remains of this kind having\r\n  been detected below the Subcarboniferous. That such remains will\r\n  eventually be found in the Devonian, there can be no reasonable doubt,\r\n  and perhaps even in the Silurian, if the land surfaces then existing\r\n  can be explored.\"\r\n\r\nThis last statement of Marsh's was, of course, partly demonstrated by\r\nthe discovery of footprints in the Devonian rocks of Pennsylvania, which\r\nhe described in 1896 as _Thinopus antiquus_. The footprints of _Dromopus\r\nagilis_ Marsh which are preserved in obverse in the University of Kansas\r\nMuseum are of considerably greater length than those described by\r\nProfessor Marsh. The measurements of one of the larger impressions are\r\nappended. There appear to be series of footprints of two different animals\r\npreserved on the large slab (5 by 7 feet), but their nature is essentially\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of Large Footprint.\r\n\r\n                                            mm.\r\n  Greatest length                           200\r\n  Greatest width                             90\r\n  Length of longest toe                     120\r\n  Length of shortest toe                     65\r\n  Width across heel                          50\r\n\r\nThe slab is No. 5 of the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History,\r\ncollected in 1873 by Professor B. F. Mudge at Osage, Kansas, and presented\r\nby him to the museum in 1875.\r\n\r\nThe following list of Carboniferous amphibian (?) footprints is compiled\r\nfrom Hay's Catalogue of Fossil Vertebrates of North America. It is given\r\nhere for the sake of completeness. Three types of amphibian footprints\r\nare described in the body of this work and they constitute the kind of\r\nmaterial which an ichnologist has for the basis of his conclusions. The\r\nmaterial is not very satisfactory for the morphologist, though much can be\r\ndetermined as to the foot structure.\r\n\r\n  Genus and species.              | Author.  |Horizon.|   Locality.\r\n  --------------------------------+----------+--------+------------------\r\n  _Allopus littoralis_            | Marsh    |  CM    | Osage County, KS.\r\n  _Anomæpus ? culbertsonii_       | King     |   \"    | Pennsylvania.\r\n  ---- _gallinuloides_            | King     |   \"    |      \"\r\n  _Anthracopus ellangowensis_     | Leidy    |   \"    |      \"\r\n  _Baropus lentus_                | Marsh    |   \"    | Osage County, KS.\r\n  _Batrachichnus plainvillensis_  | Woodworth|   \"    | Massachusetts.\r\n  _Cheirotherium ? heterodactylum_| .....    |   \"    | Pennsylvania.\r\n  ---- _reiteri_                  | Moore    |   \"    |      \"\r\n  _Collettosaurus indianænsis_    | Cox      |   \"    | Indiana.\r\n  _Crucipes parvus_               | Butts    |   \"    | Missouri.\r\n  _Dromopus agilis_               | Marsh    |   \"    | Osage County, KS.\r\n  _Hylopus caudifer_              | Dawson   |   \"    | Nova Scotia.\r\n  ---- _hardingi_                 | Dawson   |   \"    |      \"\r\n  ---- _logani_                   | Dawson   |   \"    |      \"\r\n  ---- _minor_                    | Dawson   |   \"    |      \"\r\n  ---- _trifidus_                 | Dawson   |   \"    |      \"\r\n  ---- sp. indet                  | .....    |   \"    |      \"\r\n  _Limnopus vagus_                | Marsh    |   \"    | Osage County, KS.\r\n  _Nanopus candatus_              | Marsh    |   \"    |      \"\r\n  _Notalacerta missouriensis_     | Butts    |   \"    | Missouri.\r\n  _Notamphibia magna_             | Butts    |   \"    |      \"\r\n  _Palæosauropus antiquior_       | Dawson   |  SC    | Nova Scotia.\r\n  ---- _primævus_                 | Lea      |  CM    | Pennsylvania.\r\n  ---- _sydenensis_               | Dawson   |   \"    | Cape Breton Isl.\r\n  ---- _unguifer_                 | Dawson   |  Cmg   | Nova Scotia.\r\n  _Thenaropus leplodactylus_      | King     |  CM    | Pennsylvania.\r\n  ---- _ovoidactylus_             | King     |   \"    |      \"\r\n  ---- _pachydactylus_            | King     |   \"    |      \"\r\n  ---- _sphærodactylus_           | King     |   \"    |      \"\r\n  --------------------------------+----------+--------+------------------\r\n\r\n  Horizon abbreviations\r\n  ---------------------\r\n  CM = Coal Measures.\r\n  SC = Subcarboniferous.\r\n  Cmg = Carboniferous (millstone grit).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE FOSSIL AMPHIBIA, WITH ESPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE\r\nAMPHIBIA FROM THE COAL MEASURES OF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following literature list, containing more than six hundred titles\r\n(1824-1916), is believed to be fairly complete.
